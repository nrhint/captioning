Chapter 2Lehi takes his family into the wilderness by the 

1
0:0:12,217 --> 0:0:24,434
Red Sea—They leave their property—Lehi offers a sacrifice to the 

2
0:0:24,434 --> 0:0:36,65
Lord and teaches his sons to keep the commandments—Laman and 

3
0:0:36,65 --> 0:0:48,867
Lemuel murmur against their father—Nephi is obedient and prays in 

4
0:0:48,867 --> 0:1:1,084
faith; the Lord speaks to him, and he is chosen 

5
0:1:1,084 --> 0:1:13,301
to rule over his brethren. About 600 B.C. 

6
0:1:13,301 --> 0:1:16,868
1 For behold, it came to pass that the Lord 

7
0:1:16,868 --> 0:1:20,434
spake unto my father, yea, even in a dream, and 

8
0:1:20,434 --> 0:1:24,001
said unto him: Blessed art thou Lehi, because of the 

9
0:1:24,001 --> 0:1:27,568
things which thou hast done; and because thou hast been 

10
0:1:27,568 --> 0:1:31,135
faithful and declared unto this people the things which I 

11
0:1:31,135 --> 0:1:34,702
commanded thee, behold, they seek to take away thy life. 

12
0:1:34,702 --> 0:1:40,746
2 And it came to pass that the Lord commanded 

13
0:1:40,746 --> 0:1:46,791
my father, even in a dream, that he should take 

14
0:1:46,791 --> 0:1:52,836
his family and depart into the wilderness. 

15
0:1:52,836 --> 0:1:57,38
3 And it came to pass that he was obedient 

16
0:1:57,38 --> 0:2:1,924
unto the word of the Lord, wherefore he did as 

17
0:2:1,924 --> 0:2:6,467
the Lord commanded him. 

18
0:2:6,467 --> 0:2:12,795
4 And it came to pass that he departed into 

19
0:2:12,795 --> 0:2:19,123
the wilderness. And he left his house, and the land 

20
0:2:19,123 --> 0:2:25,451
of his inheritance, and his gold, and his silver, and 

21
0:2:25,451 --> 0:2:31,779
his precious things, and took nothing with him, save it 

22
0:2:31,779 --> 0:2:38,107
were his family, and provisions, and tents, and departed into 

23
0:2:38,107 --> 0:2:44,435
the wilderness. 

24
0:2:44,435 --> 0:2:50,961
5 And he came down by the borders near the 

25
0:2:50,961 --> 0:2:57,487
shore of the Red Sea; and he traveled in the 

26
0:2:57,487 --> 0:3:4,013
wilderness in the borders which are nearer the Red Sea; 

27
0:3:4,013 --> 0:3:10,539
and he did travel in the wilderness with his family, 

28
0:3:10,539 --> 0:3:17,065
which consisted of my mother, Sariah, and my elder brothers, 

29
0:3:17,065 --> 0:3:23,591
who were Laman, Lemuel, and Sam. 

30
0:3:23,591 --> 0:3:28,093
6 And it came to pass that when he had 

31
0:3:28,093 --> 0:3:32,595
traveled three days in the wilderness, he pitched his tent 

32
0:3:32,595 --> 0:3:37,097
in a valley by the side of a river of 

33
0:3:37,097 --> 0:3:41,599
water. 

34
0:3:41,599 --> 0:3:47,57
7 And it came to pass that he built an 

35
0:3:47,57 --> 0:3:53,54
altar of stones, and made an offering unto the Lord, 

36
0:3:53,54 --> 0:3:59,511
and gave thanks unto the Lord our God. 

37
0:3:59,511 --> 0:4:4,003
8 And it came to pass that he called the 

38
0:4:4,003 --> 0:4:8,495
name of the river, Laman, and it emptied into the 

39
0:4:8,495 --> 0:4:12,988
Red Sea; and the valley was in the borders near 

40
0:4:12,988 --> 0:4:17,48
the mouth thereof. 

41
0:4:17,48 --> 0:4:24,267
9 And when my father saw that the waters of 

42
0:4:24,267 --> 0:4:31,054
the river emptied into the fountain of the Red Sea, 

43
0:4:31,054 --> 0:4:37,842
he spake unto Laman, saying: O that thou mightest be 

44
0:4:37,842 --> 0:4:44,629
like unto this river, continually running into the fountain of 

45
0:4:44,629 --> 0:4:51,417
all righteousness! 

46
0:4:51,417 --> 0:4:58,482
10 And he also spake unto Lemuel: O that thou 

47
0:4:58,482 --> 0:5:5,547
mightest be like unto this valley, firm and steadfast, and 

48
0:5:5,547 --> 0:5:12,613
immovable in keeping the commandments of the Lord! 

49
0:5:12,613 --> 0:5:19,594
11 Now this he spake because of the stiffneckedness of 

50
0:5:19,594 --> 0:5:26,576
Laman and Lemuel; for behold they did murmur in many 

51
0:5:26,576 --> 0:5:33,558
things against their father, because he was a visionary man, 

52
0:5:33,558 --> 0:5:40,54
and had led them out of the land of Jerusalem, 

53
0:5:40,54 --> 0:5:47,522
to leave the land of their inheritance, and their gold, 

54
0:5:47,522 --> 0:5:54,504
and their silver, and their precious things, to perish in 

55
0:5:54,504 --> 0:6:1,485
the wilderness. And this they said he had done because 

56
0:6:1,485 --> 0:6:8,467
of the foolish imaginations of his heart. 

57
0:6:8,467 --> 0:6:14,545
12 And thus Laman and Lemuel, being the eldest, did 

58
0:6:14,545 --> 0:6:20,623
murmur against their father. And they did murmur because they 

59
0:6:20,623 --> 0:6:26,701
knew not the dealings of that God who had created 

60
0:6:26,701 --> 0:6:32,778
them. 

61
0:6:32,778 --> 0:6:37,146
13 Neither did they believe that Jerusalem, that great city, 

62
0:6:37,146 --> 0:6:41,513
could be destroyed according to the words of the prophets. 

63
0:6:41,513 --> 0:6:45,88
And they were like unto the Jews who were at 

64
0:6:45,88 --> 0:6:50,247
Jerusalem, who sought to take away the life of my 

65
0:6:50,247 --> 0:6:54,615
father. 

66
0:6:54,615 --> 0:7:0,522
14 And it came to pass that my father did 

67
0:7:0,522 --> 0:7:6,43
speak unto them in the valley of Lemuel, with power, 

68
0:7:6,43 --> 0:7:12,337
being filled with the Spirit, until their frames did shake 

69
0:7:12,337 --> 0:7:18,245
before him. And he did confound them, that they durst 

70
0:7:18,245 --> 0:7:24,152
not utter against him; wherefore, they did as he commanded 

71
0:7:24,152 --> 0:7:30,06
them. 

72
0:7:30,06 --> 0:7:36,442
15 And my father dwelt in a tent. 

73
0:7:36,442 --> 0:7:42,669
16 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, being 

74
0:7:42,669 --> 0:7:48,896
exceedingly young, nevertheless being large in stature, and also having 

75
0:7:48,896 --> 0:7:55,124
great desires to know of the mysteries of God, wherefore, 

76
0:7:55,124 --> 0:8:1,351
I did cry unto the Lord; and behold he did 

77
0:8:1,351 --> 0:8:7,578
visit me, and did soften my heart that I did 

78
0:8:7,578 --> 0:8:13,806
believe all the words which had been spoken by my 

79
0:8:13,806 --> 0:8:20,033
father; wherefore, I did not rebel against him like unto 

80
0:8:20,033 --> 0:8:26,26
my brothers. 

81
0:8:26,26 --> 0:8:30,767
17 And I spake unto Sam, making known unto him 

82
0:8:30,767 --> 0:8:35,274
the things which the Lord had manifested unto me by 

83
0:8:35,274 --> 0:8:39,781
his Holy Spirit. And it came to pass that he 

84
0:8:39,781 --> 0:8:44,288
believed in my words. 

85
0:8:44,288 --> 0:8:51,509
18 But, behold, Laman and Lemuel would not hearken unto 

86
0:8:51,509 --> 0:8:58,731
my words; and being grieved because of the hardness of 

87
0:8:58,731 --> 0:9:5,953
their hearts I cried unto the Lord for them. 

88
0:9:5,953 --> 0:9:11,398
19 And it came to pass that the Lord spake 

89
0:9:11,398 --> 0:9:16,843
unto me, saying: Blessed art thou, Nephi, because of thy 

90
0:9:16,843 --> 0:9:22,288
faith, for thou hast sought me diligently, with lowliness of 

91
0:9:22,288 --> 0:9:27,733
heart. 

92
0:9:27,733 --> 0:9:34,612
20 And inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye 

93
0:9:34,612 --> 0:9:41,491
shall prosper, and shall be led to a land of 

94
0:9:41,491 --> 0:9:48,37
promise; yea, even a land which I have prepared for 

95
0:9:48,37 --> 0:9:55,249
you; yea, a land which is choice above all other 

96
0:9:55,249 --> 0:10:2,128
lands. 

97
0:10:2,128 --> 0:10:4,456
21 And inasmuch as thy brethren shall rebel against thee, 

98
0:10:4,456 --> 0:10:6,785
they shall be cut off from the presence of the 

99
0:10:6,785 --> 0:10:9,113
Lord. 

100
0:10:9,113 --> 0:10:13,418
22 And inasmuch as thou shalt keep my commandments, thou 

101
0:10:13,418 --> 0:10:17,724
shalt be made a ruler and a teacher over thy 

102
0:10:17,724 --> 0:10:22,029
brethren. 

103
0:10:22,029 --> 0:10:28,429
23 For behold, in that day that they shall rebel 

104
0:10:28,429 --> 0:10:34,829
against me, I will curse them even with a sore 

105
0:10:34,829 --> 0:10:41,229
curse, and they shall have no power over thy seed 

106
0:10:41,229 --> 0:10:47,629
except they shall rebel against me also. 

107
0:10:47,629 --> 0:10:53,201
24 And if it so be that they rebel against 

108
0:10:53,201 --> 0:10:58,773
me, they shall be a scourge unto thy seed, to 

109
0:10:58,773 --> 0:11:4,345
stir them up in the ways of remembrance.
