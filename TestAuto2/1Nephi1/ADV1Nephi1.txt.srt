Chapter 1Nephi begins the record of his people—Lehi sees in 

1
0:0:8,042 --> 0:0:16,085
vision a pillar of fire and reads from a book 

2
0:0:16,085 --> 0:0:24,127
of prophecy—He praises God, foretells the coming of the Messiah, 

3
0:0:24,127 --> 0:0:32,169
and prophesies the destruction of Jerusalem—He is persecuted by the 

4
0:0:32,169 --> 0:0:40,211
Jews. About 600 B.C. 

5
0:0:40,211 --> 0:0:48,999
1 I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore 

6
0:0:48,999 --> 0:0:57,788
I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my 

7
0:0:57,788 --> 0:1:6,576
father; and having seen many afflictions in the course of 

8
0:1:6,576 --> 0:1:15,364
my days, nevertheless, having been highly favored of the Lord 

9
0:1:15,364 --> 0:1:24,152
in all my days; yea, having had a great knowledge 

10
0:1:24,152 --> 0:1:32,94
of the goodness and the mysteries of God, therefore I 

11
0:1:32,94 --> 0:1:41,728
make a record of my proceedings in my days. 

12
0:1:41,728 --> 0:1:50,141
2 Yea, I make a record in the language of 

13
0:1:50,141 --> 0:1:58,555
my father, which consists of the learning of the Jews 

14
0:1:58,555 --> 0:2:6,968
and the language of the Egyptians. 

15
0:2:6,968 --> 0:2:11,363
3 And I know that the record which I make 

16
0:2:11,363 --> 0:2:15,757
is true; and I make it with mine own hand; 

17
0:2:15,757 --> 0:2:20,151
and I make it according to my knowledge. 

18
0:2:20,151 --> 0:2:28,177
4 For it came to pass in the commencement of 

19
0:2:28,177 --> 0:2:36,202
the first year of the reign of Zedekiah, king of 

20
0:2:36,202 --> 0:2:44,228
Judah, (my father, Lehi, having dwelt at Jerusalem in all 

21
0:2:44,228 --> 0:2:52,254
his days); and in that same year there came many 

22
0:2:52,254 --> 0:3:0,279
prophets, prophesying unto the people that they must repent, or 

23
0:3:0,279 --> 0:3:8,305
the great city Jerusalem must be destroyed. 

24
0:3:8,305 --> 0:3:16,853
5 Wherefore it came to pass that my father, Lehi, 

25
0:3:16,853 --> 0:3:25,401
as he went forth prayed unto the Lord, yea, even 

26
0:3:25,401 --> 0:3:33,949
with all his heart, in behalf of his people. 

27
0:3:33,949 --> 0:3:40,604
6 And it came to pass as he prayed unto 

28
0:3:40,604 --> 0:3:47,26
the Lord, there came a pillar of fire and dwelt 

29
0:3:47,26 --> 0:3:53,916
upon a rock before him; and he saw and heard 

30
0:3:53,916 --> 0:4:0,572
much; and because of the things which he saw and 

31
0:4:0,572 --> 0:4:7,227
heard he did quake and tremble exceedingly. 

32
0:4:7,227 --> 0:4:12,699
7 And it came to pass that he returned to 

33
0:4:12,699 --> 0:4:18,171
his own house at Jerusalem; and he cast himself upon 

34
0:4:18,171 --> 0:4:23,643
his bed, being overcome with the Spirit and the things 

35
0:4:23,643 --> 0:4:29,115
which he had seen. 

36
0:4:29,115 --> 0:4:37,256
8 And being thus overcome with the Spirit, he was 

37
0:4:37,256 --> 0:4:45,398
carried away in a vision, even that he saw the 

38
0:4:45,398 --> 0:4:53,539
heavens open, and he thought he saw God sitting upon 

39
0:4:53,539 --> 0:5:1,68
his throne, surrounded with numberless concourses of angels in the 

40
0:5:1,68 --> 0:5:9,821
attitude of singing and praising their God. 

41
0:5:9,821 --> 0:5:14,34
9 And it came to pass that he saw One 

42
0:5:14,34 --> 0:5:18,859
descending out of the midst of heaven, and he beheld 

43
0:5:18,859 --> 0:5:23,378
that his luster was above that of the sun at 

44
0:5:23,378 --> 0:5:27,897
noon-day. 

45
0:5:27,897 --> 0:5:35,368
10 And he also saw twelve others following him, and 

46
0:5:35,368 --> 0:5:42,838
their brightness did exceed that of the stars in the 

47
0:5:42,838 --> 0:5:50,308
firmament. 

48
0:5:50,308 --> 0:5:54,839
11 And they came down and went forth upon the 

49
0:5:54,839 --> 0:5:59,37
face of the earth; and the first came and stood 

50
0:5:59,37 --> 0:6:3,901
before my father, and gave unto him a book, and 

51
0:6:3,901 --> 0:6:8,432
bade him that he should read. 

52
0:6:8,432 --> 0:6:13,954
12 And it came to pass that as he read, 

53
0:6:13,954 --> 0:6:19,476
he was filled with the Spirit of the Lord. 

54
0:6:19,476 --> 0:6:27,739
13 And he read, saying: Wo, wo, unto Jerusalem, for 

55
0:6:27,739 --> 0:6:36,003
I have seen thine abominations! Yea, and many things did 

56
0:6:36,003 --> 0:6:44,266
my father read concerning Jerusalem—that it should be destroyed, and 

57
0:6:44,266 --> 0:6:52,529
the inhabitants thereof; many should perish by the sword, and 

58
0:6:52,529 --> 0:7:0,793
many should be carried away captive into Babylon. 

59
0:7:0,793 --> 0:7:9,203
14 And it came to pass that when my father 

60
0:7:9,203 --> 0:7:17,613
had read and seen many great and marvelous things, he 

61
0:7:17,613 --> 0:7:26,023
did exclaim many things unto the Lord; such as: Great 

62
0:7:26,023 --> 0:7:34,433
and marvelous are thy works, O Lord God Almighty! Thy 

63
0:7:34,433 --> 0:7:42,843
throne is high in the heavens, and thy power, and 

64
0:7:42,843 --> 0:7:51,253
goodness, and mercy are over all the inhabitants of the 

65
0:7:51,253 --> 0:7:59,663
earth; and, because thou art merciful, thou wilt not suffer 

66
0:7:59,663 --> 0:8:8,073
those who come unto thee that they shall perish! 

67
0:8:8,073 --> 0:8:14,836
15 And after this manner was the language of my 

68
0:8:14,836 --> 0:8:21,6
father in the praising of his God; for his soul 

69
0:8:21,6 --> 0:8:28,363
did rejoice, and his whole heart was filled, because of 

70
0:8:28,363 --> 0:8:35,127
the things which he had seen, yea, which the Lord 

71
0:8:35,127 --> 0:8:41,89
had shown unto him. 

72
0:8:41,89 --> 0:8:49,268
16 And now I, Nephi, do not make a full 

73
0:8:49,268 --> 0:8:56,647
account of the things which my father hath written, for 

74
0:8:56,647 --> 0:9:4,025
he hath written many things which he saw in visions 

75
0:9:4,025 --> 0:9:11,404
and in dreams; and he also hath written many things 

76
0:9:11,404 --> 0:9:18,782
which he prophesied and spake unto his children, of which 

77
0:9:18,782 --> 0:9:26,161
I shall not make a full account. 

78
0:9:26,161 --> 0:9:31,185
17 But I shall make an account of my proceedings 

79
0:9:31,185 --> 0:9:36,209
in my days. Behold, I make an abridgment of the 

80
0:9:36,209 --> 0:9:41,233
record of my father, upon plates which I have made 

81
0:9:41,233 --> 0:9:46,258
with mine own hands; wherefore, after I have abridged the 

82
0:9:46,258 --> 0:9:51,282
record of my father then will I make an account 

83
0:9:51,282 --> 0:9:56,306
of mine own life. 

84
0:9:56,306 --> 0:10:3,043
18 Therefore, I would that ye should know, that after 

85
0:10:3,043 --> 0:10:9,779
the Lord had shown so many marvelous things unto my 

86
0:10:9,779 --> 0:10:16,516
father, Lehi, yea, concerning the destruction of Jerusalem, behold he 

87
0:10:16,516 --> 0:10:23,252
went forth among the people, and began to prophesy and 

88
0:10:23,252 --> 0:10:29,989
to declare unto them concerning the things which he had 

89
0:10:29,989 --> 0:10:36,725
both seen and heard. 

90
0:10:36,725 --> 0:10:43,643
19 And it came to pass that the Jews did 

91
0:10:43,643 --> 0:10:50,561
mock him because of the things which he testified of 

92
0:10:50,561 --> 0:10:57,479
them; for he truly testified of their wickedness and their 

93
0:10:57,479 --> 0:11:4,397
abominations; and he testified that the things which he saw 

94
0:11:4,397 --> 0:11:11,315
and heard, and also the things which he read in 

95
0:11:11,315 --> 0:11:18,232
the book, manifested plainly of the coming of a Messiah, 

96
0:11:18,232 --> 0:11:25,15
and also the redemption of the world. 

97
0:11:25,15 --> 0:11:32,848
20 And when the Jews heard these things they were 

98
0:11:32,848 --> 0:11:40,545
angry with him; yea, even as with the prophets of 

99
0:11:40,545 --> 0:11:48,243
old, whom they had cast out, and stoned, and slain; 

100
0:11:48,243 --> 0:11:55,94
and they also sought his life, that they might take 

101
0:11:55,94 --> 0:12:3,638
it away. But behold, I, Nephi, will show unto you 

102
0:12:3,638 --> 0:12:11,336
that the tender mercies of the Lord are over all 

103
0:12:11,336 --> 0:12:19,033
those whom he hath chosen, because of their faith, to 

104
0:12:19,033 --> 0:12:26,731
make them mighty even unto the power of deliverance.
