00:00:00,4 --> 00:00:09,829
Chapter 14 An angel tells Nephi of the blessings

2
00:00:09,829 --> 00:00:19,258
 and cursings to fall upon the Gentiles—There are

3
00:00:19,258 --> 00:00:28,687
 only two churches: the Church of the Lamb of God and

4
00:00:28,687 --> 00:00:38,116
 the church of the devil—The Saints of God in all

5
00:00:38,116 --> 00:00:47,545
 nations are persecuted by the great and abominable

6
00:00:47,545 --> 00:00:56,974
 church—The Apostle John will write concerning the

7
00:00:56,974 --> 00:01:06,403
 end of the world. About 600–592 B.C.

8
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:12,299
1 And it shall come to pass, that if the Gentiles

9
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:18,499
 shall hearken unto the Lamb of God in that day

10
00:01:18,499 --> 00:01:24,699
 that he shall manifest himself unto them in word, and

11
00:01:24,699 --> 00:01:30,899
 also in power, in very deed, unto the taking away

12
00:01:30,899 --> 00:01:37,099
 of their stumbling blocks

13
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:44,855
2 And harden not their hearts against the Lamb of

14
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:51,712
 God, they shall be numbered among the seed of thy

15
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:58,569
 father; yea, they shall be numbered among the

16
00:01:58,569 --> 00:02:05,426
 house of Israel; and they shall be a blessed people

17
00:02:05,426 --> 00:02:12,283
 upon the promised land forever; they shall be no

18
00:02:12,283 --> 00:02:19,14
 more brought down into captivity; and the house of

19
00:02:19,14 --> 00:02:25,997
 Israel shall no more be confounded

20
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:32,312
3 And that great pit, which hath been digged for

21
00:02:32,312 --> 00:02:39,012
 them by that great and abominable church, which was

22
00:02:39,012 --> 00:02:45,712
 founded by the devil and his children, that he

23
00:02:45,712 --> 00:02:52,412
 might lead away the souls of men down to hell—yea,

24
00:02:52,412 --> 00:02:59,112
 that great pit which hath been digged for the

25
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:05,812
 destruction of men shall be filled by those who digged

26
00:03:05,812 --> 00:03:12,512
 it, unto their utter destruction, saith the Lamb

27
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:19,212
 of God; not the destruction of the soul, save it be

28
00:03:19,212 --> 00:03:25,912
 the casting of it into that hell which hath no

29
00:03:25,912 --> 00:03:32,612
 end

30
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:39,779
4 For behold, this is according to the captivity

31
00:03:39,779 --> 00:03:46,779
 of the devil, and also according to the justice of

32
00:03:46,779 --> 00:03:53,779
 God, upon all those who will work wickedness and

33
00:03:53,779 --> 00:04:00,779
 abomination before him

34
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:07,14
5 And it came to pass that the angel spake unto

35
00:04:07,14 --> 00:04:13,473
 me, Nephi, saying: Thou hast beheld that if the

36
00:04:13,473 --> 00:04:19,806
 Gentiles repent it shall be well with them; and thou

37
00:04:19,806 --> 00:04:26,139
 also knowest concerning the covenants of the Lord

38
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:32,472
 unto the house of Israel; and thou also hast heard

39
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:38,805
 that whoso repenteth not must perish

40
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:42,344
6 Therefore, wo be unto the Gentiles if it so be

41
00:04:42,344 --> 00:04:46,677
 that they harden their hearts against the Lamb of

42
00:04:46,677 --> 00:04:51,01
 God

43
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:58,027
7 For the time cometh, saith the Lamb of God, that

44
00:04:58,027 --> 00:05:04,663
 I will work a great and a marvelous work among

45
00:05:04,663 --> 00:05:11,299
 the children of men; a work which shall be

46
00:05:11,299 --> 00:05:17,935
 everlasting, either on the one hand or on the other—either

47
00:05:17,935 --> 00:05:24,571
 to the convincing of them unto peace and life

48
00:05:24,571 --> 00:05:31,207
 eternal, or unto the deliverance of them to the

49
00:05:31,207 --> 00:05:37,843
 hardness of their hearts and the blindness of their

50
00:05:37,843 --> 00:05:44,479
 minds unto their being brought down into captivity,

51
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:51,115
 and also into destruction, both temporally and

52
00:05:51,115 --> 00:05:57,751
 spiritually, according to the captivity of the devil,

53
00:05:57,751 --> 00:06:04,387
 of which I have spoken

54
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:09,647
8 And it came to pass that when the angel had

55
00:06:09,647 --> 00:06:14,897
 spoken these words, he said unto me: Rememberest thou

56
00:06:14,897 --> 00:06:20,147
 the covenants of the Father unto the house of

57
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:25,397
 Israel? I said unto him, Yea

58
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:29,768
9 And it came to pass that he said unto me: Look,

59
00:06:29,768 --> 00:06:34,518
 and behold that great and abominable church, which

60
00:06:34,518 --> 00:06:39,268
 is the mother of abominations, whose founder is

61
00:06:39,268 --> 00:06:44,018
 the devil

62
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:50,971
10 And he said unto me: Behold there are save two

63
00:06:50,971 --> 00:06:56,971
 churches only; the one is the church of the Lamb

64
00:06:56,971 --> 00:07:02,971
 of God, and the other is the church of the devil;

65
00:07:02,971 --> 00:07:08,971
 wherefore, whoso belongeth not to the church of the

66
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:14,971
 Lamb of God belongeth to that great church, which

67
00:07:14,971 --> 00:07:20,971
 is the mother of abominations; and she is the

68
00:07:20,971 --> 00:07:26,971
 whore of all the earth

69
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:33,196
11 And it came to pass that I looked and beheld

70
00:07:33,196 --> 00:07:39,946
 the whore of all the earth, and she sat upon many

71
00:07:39,946 --> 00:07:46,696
 waters; and she had dominion over all the earth,

72
00:07:46,696 --> 00:07:53,446
 among all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people

73
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:59,451
12 And it came to pass that I beheld the church of

74
00:07:59,451 --> 00:08:05,229
 the Lamb of God, and its numbers were few,

75
00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:11,007
 because of the wickedness and abominations of the whore

76
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:16,785
 who sat upon many waters; nevertheless, I beheld

77
00:08:16,785 --> 00:08:22,563
 that the church of the Lamb, who were the saints of

78
00:08:22,563 --> 00:08:28,341
 God, were also upon all the face of the earth;

79
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:34,119
 and their dominions upon the face of the earth were

80
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:39,897
 small, because of the wickedness of the great

81
00:08:39,897 --> 00:08:45,675
 whore whom I saw

82
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:51,992
13 And it came to pass that I beheld that the

83
00:08:51,992 --> 00:08:57,992
 great mother of abominations did gather together

84
00:08:57,992 --> 00:09:03,992
 multitudes upon the face of all the earth, among all

85
00:09:03,992 --> 00:09:09,992
 the nations of the Gentiles, to fight against the

86
00:09:09,992 --> 00:09:15,992
 Lamb of God

87
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:21,088
14 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld the

88
00:09:21,088 --> 00:09:27,088
 power of the Lamb of God, that it descended upon

89
00:09:27,088 --> 00:09:33,088
 the saints of the church of the Lamb, and upon the

90
00:09:33,088 --> 00:09:39,088
 covenant people of the Lord, who were scattered

91
00:09:39,088 --> 00:09:45,088
 upon all the face of the earth; and they were armed

92
00:09:45,088 --> 00:09:51,088
 with righteousness and with the power of God in

93
00:09:51,088 --> 00:09:57,088
 great glory

94
00:09:57,63 --> 00:10:02,43
15 And it came to pass that I beheld that the

95
00:10:02,43 --> 00:10:07,23
 wrath of God was poured out upon that great and

96
00:10:07,23 --> 00:10:12,03
 abominable church, insomuch that there were wars and

97
00:10:12,03 --> 00:10:16,83
 rumors of wars among all the nations and kindreds of

98
00:10:16,83 --> 00:10:21,63
 the earth

99
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:28,488
16 And as there began to be wars and rumors of

100
00:10:28,488 --> 00:10:35,288
 wars among all the nations which belonged to the

101
00:10:35,288 --> 00:10:42,088
 mother of abominations, the angel spake unto me,

102
00:10:42,088 --> 00:10:48,888
 saying: Behold, the wrath of God is upon the mother of

103
00:10:48,888 --> 00:10:55,688
 harlots; and behold, thou seest all these things

104
00:10:55,922 --> 00:11:01,922
17 And when the day cometh that the wrath of God

105
00:11:01,922 --> 00:11:07,922
 is poured out upon the mother of harlots, which is

106
00:11:07,922 --> 00:11:13,922
 the great and abominable church of all the earth,

107
00:11:13,922 --> 00:11:19,922
 whose founder is the devil, then, at that day, the

108
00:11:19,922 --> 00:11:25,922
 work of the Father shall commence, in preparing

109
00:11:25,922 --> 00:11:31,922
 the way for the fulfilling of his covenants, which

110
00:11:31,922 --> 00:11:37,922
 he hath made to his people who are of the house of

111
00:11:37,922 --> 00:11:43,922
 Israel

112
00:11:43,57 --> 00:11:48,07
18 And it came to pass that the angel spake unto

113
00:11:48,07 --> 00:11:52,57
 me, saying: Look

114
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:58,645
19 And I looked and beheld a man, and he was

115
00:11:58,645 --> 00:12:04,645
 dressed in a white robe

116
00:12:04,49 --> 00:12:09,99
20 And the angel said unto me: Behold one of the

117
00:12:09,99 --> 00:12:15,49
 twelve apostles of the Lamb

118
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:20,335
21 Behold, he shall see and write the remainder of

119
00:12:20,335 --> 00:12:25,335
 these things; yea, and also many things which

120
00:12:25,335 --> 00:12:30,335
 have been

121
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:34,317
22 And he shall also write concerning the end of

122
00:12:34,317 --> 00:12:37,817
 the world

123
00:12:37,59 --> 00:12:43,09
23 Wherefore, the things which he shall write are

124
00:12:43,09 --> 00:12:48,59
 just and true; and behold they are written in the

125
00:12:48,59 --> 00:12:54,09
 book which thou beheld proceeding out of the mouth

126
00:12:54,09 --> 00:12:59,59
 of the Jew; and at the time they proceeded out of

127
00:12:59,59 --> 00:13:05,09
 the mouth of the Jew, or, at the time the book

128
00:13:05,09 --> 00:13:10,59
 proceeded out of the mouth of the Jew, the things

129
00:13:10,59 --> 00:13:16,09
 which were written were plain and pure, and most

130
00:13:16,09 --> 00:13:21,59
 precious and easy to the understanding of all men

131
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:27,834
24 And behold, the things which this apostle of

132
00:13:27,834 --> 00:13:33,834
 the Lamb shall write are many things which thou hast

133
00:13:33,834 --> 00:13:39,834
 seen; and behold, the remainder shalt thou see

134
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:44,202
25 But the things which thou shalt see hereafter

135
00:13:44,202 --> 00:13:48,952
 thou shalt not write; for the Lord God hath

136
00:13:48,952 --> 00:13:53,702
 ordained the apostle of the Lamb of God that he should

137
00:13:53,702 --> 00:13:58,452
 write them

138
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:03,605
26 And also others who have been, to them hath he

139
00:14:03,605 --> 00:14:08,772
 shown all things, and they have written them; and

140
00:14:08,772 --> 00:14:13,939
 they are sealed up to come forth in their purity,

141
00:14:13,939 --> 00:14:19,106
 according to the truth which is in the Lamb, in

142
00:14:19,106 --> 00:14:24,273
 the own due time of the Lord, unto the house of

143
00:14:24,273 --> 00:14:29,44
 Israel

144
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:35,735
27 And I, Nephi, heard and bear record, that the

145
00:14:35,735 --> 00:14:42,068
 name of the apostle of the Lamb was John, according

146
00:14:42,068 --> 00:14:48,401
 to the word of the angel

147
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:54,788
28 And behold, I, Nephi, am forbidden that I

148
00:14:54,788 --> 00:15:01,188
 should write the remainder of the things which I saw

149
00:15:01,188 --> 00:15:07,588
 and heard; wherefore the things which I have written

150
00:15:07,588 --> 00:15:13,988
 sufficeth me; and I have written but a small part

151
00:15:13,988 --> 00:15:20,388
 of the things which I saw

152
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:24,719
29 And I bear record that I saw the things which

153
00:15:24,719 --> 00:15:29,386
 my father saw, and the angel of the Lord did make

154
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:34,053
 them known unto me

155
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,833
30 And now I make an end of speaking concerning

156
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,633
 the things which I saw while I was carried away in

157
00:15:37,633 --> 00:15:39,433
 the Spirit; and if all the things which I saw are

158
00:15:39,433 --> 00:15:41,233
 not written, the things which I have written are

159
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:43,033
 true. And thus it is. Amen.
