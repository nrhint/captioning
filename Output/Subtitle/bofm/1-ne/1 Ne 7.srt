1
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:15,85
Chapter 7 Lehi’s sons return to Jerusalem and

2
00:00:15,85 --> 00:00:23,725
 invite Ishmael and his household to join them in their

3
00:00:23,725 --> 00:00:31,6
 journey—Laman and others rebel—Nephi exhorts his

4
00:00:31,6 --> 00:00:39,475
 brethren to have faith in the Lord—They bind him

5
00:00:39,475 --> 00:00:47,35
 with cords and plan his destruction—He is freed by

6
00:00:47,35 --> 00:00:55,225
 the power of faith—His brethren ask

7
00:00:55,225 --> 00:01:03,1
 forgiveness—Lehi and his company offer sacrifice and burnt

8
00:01:03,1 --> 00:01:10,975
 offerings. About 600–592 B.C.

9
00:01:10,27 --> 00:01:22,145
1 And now I would that ye might know, that after

10
00:01:22,145 --> 00:01:34,02
 my father, Lehi, had made an end of prophesying

11
00:01:34,02 --> 00:01:45,895
 concerning his seed, it came to pass that the Lord

12
00:01:45,895 --> 00:01:57,77
 spake unto him again, saying that it was not meet

13
00:01:57,77 --> 00:02:09,645
 for him, Lehi, that he should take his family into

14
00:02:09,645 --> 00:02:21,52
 the wilderness alone; but that his sons should take

15
00:02:21,52 --> 00:02:33,395
 daughters to wife, that they might raise up seed

16
00:02:33,395 --> 00:02:45,27
 unto the Lord in the land of promise

17
00:02:45,966 --> 00:03:01,966
2 And it came to pass that the Lord commanded him

18
00:03:01,966 --> 00:03:17,966
 that I, Nephi, and my brethren, should again

19
00:03:17,966 --> 00:03:33,966
 return unto the land of Jerusalem, and bring down

20
00:03:33,966 --> 00:03:49,966
 Ishmael and his family into the wilderness

21
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:52,43
3 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did again,

22
00:03:52,43 --> 00:03:55,097
 with my brethren, go forth into the wilderness to go

23
00:03:55,097 --> 00:03:57,764
 up to Jerusalem

24
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:03,738
4 And it came to pass that we went up unto the

25
00:04:03,738 --> 00:04:09,738
 house of Ishmael, and we did gain favor in the sight

26
00:04:09,738 --> 00:04:15,738
 of Ishmael, insomuch that we did speak unto him

27
00:04:15,738 --> 00:04:21,738
 the words of the Lord

28
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:33,661
5 And it came to pass that the Lord did soften the

29
00:04:33,661 --> 00:04:45,661
 heart of Ishmael, and also his household,

30
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:57,661
 insomuch that they took their journey with us down into

31
00:04:57,661 --> 00:05:09,661
 the wilderness to the tent of our father

32
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:12,176
6 And it came to pass that as we journeyed in the

33
00:05:12,176 --> 00:05:14,843
 wilderness, behold Laman and Lemuel, and two of

34
00:05:14,843 --> 00:05:17,51
 the daughters of Ishmael, and the two sons of

35
00:05:17,51 --> 00:05:20,177
 Ishmael and their families, did rebel against us; yea,

36
00:05:20,177 --> 00:05:22,844
 against me, Nephi, and Sam, and their father,

37
00:05:22,844 --> 00:05:25,511
 Ishmael, and his wife, and his three other daughters

38
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,125
7 And it came to pass in the which rebellion, they

39
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:30,792
 were desirous to return unto the land of

40
00:05:30,792 --> 00:05:33,459
 Jerusalem

41
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:34,433
8 And now I, Nephi, being grieved for the hardness

42
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:35,433
 of their hearts, therefore I spake unto them,

43
00:05:35,433 --> 00:05:36,433
 saying, yea, even unto Laman and unto Lemuel: Behold

44
00:05:36,433 --> 00:05:37,433
 ye are mine elder brethren, and how is it that ye

45
00:05:37,433 --> 00:05:38,433
 are so hard in your hearts, and so blind in your

46
00:05:38,433 --> 00:05:39,433
 minds, that ye have need that I, your younger

47
00:05:39,433 --> 00:05:40,433
 brother, should speak unto you, yea, and set an example

48
00:05:40,433 --> 00:05:41,433
 for you

49
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:45,408
9 How is it that ye have not hearkened unto the

50
00:05:45,408 --> 00:05:49,408
 word of the Lord

51
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:49,382
10 How is it that ye have forgotten that ye have

52
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:49,382
 seen an angel of the Lord

53
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:53,783
11 Yea, and how is it that ye have forgotten what

54
00:05:53,783 --> 00:05:57,783
 great things the Lord hath done for us, in

55
00:05:57,783 --> 00:06:01,783
 delivering us out of the hands of Laban, and also that we

56
00:06:01,783 --> 00:06:05,783
 should obtain the record

57
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:11,898
12 Yea, and how is it that ye have forgotten that

58
00:06:11,898 --> 00:06:18,298
 the Lord is able to do all things according to his

59
00:06:18,298 --> 00:06:24,698
 will, for the children of men, if it so be that

60
00:06:24,698 --> 00:06:31,098
 they exercise faith in him? Wherefore, let us be

61
00:06:31,098 --> 00:06:37,498
 faithful to him

62
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:41,968
13 And if it so be that we are faithful to him, we

63
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:46,539
 shall obtain the land of promise; and ye shall

64
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:51,11
 know at some future period that the word of the Lord

65
00:06:51,11 --> 00:06:55,681
 shall be fulfilled concerning the destruction of

66
00:06:55,681 --> 00:07:00,252
 Jerusalem; for all things which the Lord hath

67
00:07:00,252 --> 00:07:04,823
 spoken concerning the destruction of Jerusalem must be

68
00:07:04,823 --> 00:07:09,394
 fulfilled

69
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:16,463
14 For behold, the Spirit of the Lord ceaseth soon

70
00:07:16,463 --> 00:07:23,63
 to strive with them; for behold, they have

71
00:07:23,63 --> 00:07:30,797
 rejected the prophets, and Jeremiah have they cast into

72
00:07:30,797 --> 00:07:37,964
 prison. And they have sought to take away the life

73
00:07:37,964 --> 00:07:45,131
 of my father, insomuch that they have driven him

74
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:52,298
 out of the land

75
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:59,806
15 Now behold, I say unto you that if ye will

76
00:07:59,806 --> 00:08:06,639
 return unto Jerusalem ye shall also perish with them.

77
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:13,472
 And now, if ye have choice, go up to the land, and

78
00:08:13,472 --> 00:08:20,305
 remember the words which I speak unto you, that

79
00:08:20,305 --> 00:08:27,138
 if ye go ye will also perish; for thus the Spirit

80
00:08:27,138 --> 00:08:33,971
 of the Lord constraineth me that I should speak

81
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:39,196
16 And it came to pass that when I, Nephi, had

82
00:08:39,196 --> 00:08:44,946
 spoken these words unto my brethren, they were angry

83
00:08:44,946 --> 00:08:50,696
 with me. And it came to pass that they did lay

84
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:56,446
 their hands upon me, for behold, they were

85
00:08:56,446 --> 00:09:02,196
 exceedingly wroth, and they did bind me with cords, for they

86
00:09:02,196 --> 00:09:07,946
 sought to take away my life, that they might

87
00:09:07,946 --> 00:09:13,696
 leave me in the wilderness to be devoured by wild

88
00:09:13,696 --> 00:09:19,446
 beasts

89
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:25,892
17 But it came to pass that I prayed unto the

90
00:09:25,892 --> 00:09:32,692
 Lord, saying: O Lord, according to my faith which is

91
00:09:32,692 --> 00:09:39,492
 in thee, wilt thou deliver me from the hands of my

92
00:09:39,492 --> 00:09:46,292
 brethren; yea, even give me strength that I may

93
00:09:46,292 --> 00:09:53,092
 burst these bands with which I am bound

94
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:59,276
18 And it came to pass that when I had said these

95
00:09:59,276 --> 00:10:05,526
 words, behold, the bands were loosed from off my

96
00:10:05,526 --> 00:10:11,776
 hands and feet, and I stood before my brethren, and

97
00:10:11,776 --> 00:10:18,026
 I spake unto them again

98
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:24,299
19 And it came to pass that they were angry with

99
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:30,013
 me again, and sought to lay hands upon me; but

100
00:10:30,013 --> 00:10:35,727
 behold, one of the daughters of Ishmael, yea, and also

101
00:10:35,727 --> 00:10:41,441
 her mother, and one of the sons of Ishmael, did

102
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:47,155
 plead with my brethren, insomuch that they did

103
00:10:47,155 --> 00:10:52,869
 soften their hearts; and they did cease striving to

104
00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:58,583
 take away my life

105
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:03,158
20 And it came to pass that they were sorrowful,

106
00:11:03,158 --> 00:11:07,758
 because of their wickedness, insomuch that they did

107
00:11:07,758 --> 00:11:12,358
 bow down before me, and did plead with me that I

108
00:11:12,358 --> 00:11:16,958
 would forgive them of the thing that they had done

109
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:21,558
 against me

110
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:25,971
21 And it came to pass that I did frankly forgive

111
00:11:25,971 --> 00:11:30,828
 them all that they had done, and I did exhort them

112
00:11:30,828 --> 00:11:35,685
 that they would pray unto the Lord their God for

113
00:11:35,685 --> 00:11:40,542
 forgiveness. And it came to pass that they did so.

114
00:11:40,542 --> 00:11:45,399
 And after they had done praying unto the Lord we

115
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:50,256
 did again travel on our journey towards the tent

116
00:11:50,256 --> 00:11:55,113
 of our father

117
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:56,748
22 And it came to pass that we did come down unto

118
00:11:56,748 --> 00:11:57,748
 the tent of our father. And after I and my

119
00:11:57,748 --> 00:11:58,748
 brethren and all the house of Ishmael had come down unto

120
00:11:58,748 --> 00:11:59,748
 the tent of my father, they did give thanks unto

121
00:11:59,748 --> 00:12:00,748
 the Lord their God; and they did offer sacrifice

122
00:12:00,748 --> 00:12:01,748
 and burnt offerings unto him.
