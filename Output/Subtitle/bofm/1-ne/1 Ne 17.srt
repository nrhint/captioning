00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:16,442
Chapter 17 Nephi is commanded to build a ship—His

2
00:00:16,442 --> 00:00:24,275
 brethren oppose him—He exhorts them by recounting

3
00:00:24,275 --> 00:00:32,108
 the history of God’s dealings with Israel—Nephi is

4
00:00:32,108 --> 00:00:39,941
 filled with the power of God—His brethren are

5
00:00:39,941 --> 00:00:47,774
 forbidden to touch him, lest they wither as a dried

6
00:00:47,774 --> 00:00:55,607
 reed. About 592–591 B.C.

7
00:00:55,556 --> 00:01:00,889
1 And it came to pass that we did again take our

8
00:01:00,889 --> 00:01:06,222
 journey in the wilderness; and we did travel nearly

9
00:01:06,222 --> 00:01:11,555
 eastward from that time forth. And we did travel

10
00:01:11,555 --> 00:01:16,888
 and wade through much affliction in the

11
00:01:16,888 --> 00:01:22,221
 wilderness; and our women did bear children in the

12
00:01:22,221 --> 00:01:27,553
 wilderness

13
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:33,621
2 And so great were the blessings of the Lord upon

14
00:01:33,621 --> 00:01:39,788
 us, that while we did live upon raw meat in the

15
00:01:39,788 --> 00:01:45,955
 wilderness, our women did give plenty of suck for

16
00:01:45,955 --> 00:01:52,122
 their children, and were strong, yea, even like

17
00:01:52,122 --> 00:01:58,289
 unto the men; and they began to bear their

18
00:01:58,289 --> 00:02:04,456
 journeyings without murmurings

19
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:09,962
3 And thus we see that the commandments of God

20
00:02:09,962 --> 00:02:15,533
 must be fulfilled. And if it so be that the children

21
00:02:15,533 --> 00:02:21,104
 of men keep the commandments of God he doth

22
00:02:21,104 --> 00:02:26,675
 nourish them, and strengthen them, and provide means

23
00:02:26,675 --> 00:02:32,246
 whereby they can accomplish the thing which he has

24
00:02:32,246 --> 00:02:37,817
 commanded them; wherefore, he did provide means for

25
00:02:37,817 --> 00:02:43,388
 us while we did sojourn in the wilderness

26
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:50,797
4 And we did sojourn for the space of many years,

27
00:02:50,797 --> 00:02:57,797
 yea, even eight years in the wilderness

28
00:02:57,077 --> 00:03:03,744
5 And we did come to the land which we called

29
00:03:03,744 --> 00:03:10,411
 Bountiful, because of its much fruit and also wild

30
00:03:10,411 --> 00:03:17,078
 honey; and all these things were prepared of the Lord

31
00:03:17,078 --> 00:03:23,745
 that we might not perish. And we beheld the sea,

32
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:30,412
 which we called Irreantum, which, being

33
00:03:30,412 --> 00:03:37,079
 interpreted, is many waters

34
00:03:37,35 --> 00:03:43,493
6 And it came to pass that we did pitch our tents

35
00:03:43,493 --> 00:03:49,636
 by the seashore; and notwithstanding we had

36
00:03:49,636 --> 00:03:55,779
 suffered many afflictions and much difficulty, yea, even

37
00:03:55,779 --> 00:04:01,922
 so much that we cannot write them all, we were

38
00:04:01,922 --> 00:04:08,065
 exceedingly rejoiced when we came to the seashore;

39
00:04:08,065 --> 00:04:14,208
 and we called the place Bountiful, because of its

40
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:20,351
 much fruit

41
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:25,626
7 And it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had

42
00:04:25,626 --> 00:04:30,959
 been in the land of Bountiful for the space of many

43
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:36,292
 days, the voice of the Lord came unto me, saying:

44
00:04:36,292 --> 00:04:41,625
 Arise, and get thee into the mountain. And it came

45
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:46,958
 to pass that I arose and went up into the

46
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:52,291
 mountain, and cried unto the Lord

47
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:58,043
8 And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto me,

48
00:04:58,043 --> 00:05:03,293
 saying: Thou shalt construct a ship, after the

49
00:05:03,293 --> 00:05:08,543
 manner which I shall show thee, that I may carry thy

50
00:05:08,543 --> 00:05:13,793
 people across these waters

51
00:05:13,88 --> 00:05:19,38
9 And I said: Lord, whither shall I go that I may

52
00:05:19,38 --> 00:05:24,88
 find ore to molten, that I may make tools to

53
00:05:24,88 --> 00:05:30,38
 construct the ship after the manner which thou hast

54
00:05:30,38 --> 00:05:35,88
 shown unto me

55
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:39,836
10 And it came to pass that the Lord told me

56
00:05:39,836 --> 00:05:43,836
 whither I should go to find ore, that I might make

57
00:05:43,836 --> 00:05:47,836
 tools

58
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:49,581
11 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did make a

59
00:05:49,581 --> 00:05:51,181
 bellows wherewith to blow the fire, of the skins of

60
00:05:51,181 --> 00:05:52,781
 beasts; and after I had made a bellows, that I

61
00:05:52,781 --> 00:05:54,381
 might have wherewith to blow the fire, I did smite

62
00:05:54,381 --> 00:05:55,981
 two stones together that I might make fire

63
00:05:55,956 --> 00:06:01,956
12 For the Lord had not hitherto suffered that we

64
00:06:01,956 --> 00:06:07,956
 should make much fire, as we journeyed in the

65
00:06:07,956 --> 00:06:13,956
 wilderness; for he said: I will make thy food become

66
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:19,956
 sweet, that ye cook it not

67
00:06:19,88 --> 00:06:30,88
13 And I will also be your light in the

68
00:06:30,88 --> 00:06:41,88
 wilderness; and I will prepare the way before you, if it so

69
00:06:41,88 --> 00:06:52,88
 be that ye shall keep my commandments; wherefore,

70
00:06:52,88 --> 00:07:03,88
 inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments ye shall

71
00:07:03,88 --> 00:07:14,88
 be led towards the promised land; and ye shall

72
00:07:14,88 --> 00:07:25,88
 know that it is by me that ye are led

73
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:28,011
14 Yea, and the Lord said also that: After ye have

74
00:07:28,011 --> 00:07:31,011
 arrived in the promised land, ye shall know that

75
00:07:31,011 --> 00:07:34,011
 I, the Lord, am God; and that I, the Lord, did

76
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:37,011
 deliver you from destruction; yea, that I did bring

77
00:07:37,011 --> 00:07:40,011
 you out of the land of Jerusalem

78
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:46,294
15 Wherefore, I, Nephi, did strive to keep the

79
00:07:46,294 --> 00:07:51,627
 commandments of the Lord, and I did exhort my

80
00:07:51,627 --> 00:07:56,96
 brethren to faithfulness and diligence

81
00:07:56,91 --> 00:08:13,91
16 And it came to pass that I did make tools of

82
00:08:13,91 --> 00:08:30,91
 the ore which I did molten out of the rock

83
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:37,377
17 And when my brethren saw that I was about to

84
00:08:37,377 --> 00:08:43,777
 build a ship, they began to murmur against me,

85
00:08:43,777 --> 00:08:50,177
 saying: Our brother is a fool, for he thinketh that he

86
00:08:50,177 --> 00:08:56,577
 can build a ship; yea, and he also thinketh that

87
00:08:56,577 --> 00:09:02,977
 he can cross these great waters

88
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:07,042
18 And thus my brethren did complain against me,

89
00:09:07,042 --> 00:09:12,042
 and were desirous that they might not labor, for

90
00:09:12,042 --> 00:09:17,042
 they did not believe that I could build a ship;

91
00:09:17,042 --> 00:09:22,042
 neither would they believe that I was instructed of

92
00:09:22,042 --> 00:09:27,042
 the Lord

93
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:33,833
19 And now it came to pass that I, Nephi, was

94
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:40,333
 exceedingly sorrowful because of the hardness of their

95
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:46,833
 hearts; and now when they saw that I began to be

96
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:53,333
 sorrowful they were glad in their hearts, insomuch

97
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:59,833
 that they did rejoice over me, saying: We knew

98
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:06,333
 that ye could not construct a ship, for we knew that

99
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:12,833
 ye were lacking in judgment; wherefore, thou

100
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:19,333
 canst not accomplish so great a work

101
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:24,785
20 And thou art like unto our father, led away by

102
00:10:24,785 --> 00:10:30,385
 the foolish imaginations of his heart; yea, he

103
00:10:30,385 --> 00:10:35,985
 hath led us out of the land of Jerusalem, and we have

104
00:10:35,985 --> 00:10:41,585
 wandered in the wilderness for these many years;

105
00:10:41,585 --> 00:10:47,185
 and our women have toiled, being big with child;

106
00:10:47,185 --> 00:10:52,785
 and they have borne children in the wilderness and

107
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:58,385
 suffered all things, save it were death; and it

108
00:10:58,385 --> 00:11:03,985
 would have been better that they had died before

109
00:11:03,985 --> 00:11:09,585
 they came out of Jerusalem than to have suffered

110
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:15,185
 these afflictions

111
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:22,909
21 Behold, these many years we have suffered in

112
00:11:22,909 --> 00:11:29,909
 the wilderness, which time we might have enjoyed our

113
00:11:29,909 --> 00:11:36,909
 possessions and the land of our inheritance; yea,

114
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:43,909
 and we might have been happy

115
00:11:43,87 --> 00:11:49,97
22 And we know that the people who were in the

116
00:11:49,97 --> 00:11:56,07
 land of Jerusalem were a righteous people; for they

117
00:11:56,07 --> 00:12:02,17
 kept the statutes and judgments of the Lord, and

118
00:12:02,17 --> 00:12:08,27
 all his commandments, according to the law of Moses;

119
00:12:08,27 --> 00:12:14,37
 wherefore, we know that they are a righteous

120
00:12:14,37 --> 00:12:20,47
 people; and our father hath judged them, and hath led

121
00:12:20,47 --> 00:12:26,57
 us away because we would hearken unto his words;

122
00:12:26,57 --> 00:12:32,67
 yea, and our brother is like unto him. And after

123
00:12:32,67 --> 00:12:38,77
 this manner of language did my brethren murmur and

124
00:12:38,77 --> 00:12:44,87
 complain against us

125
00:12:44,53 --> 00:12:50,53
23 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, spake unto

126
00:12:50,53 --> 00:12:56,53
 them, saying: Do ye believe that our fathers, who

127
00:12:56,53 --> 00:13:02,53
 were the children of Israel, would have been led

128
00:13:02,53 --> 00:13:08,53
 away out of the hands of the Egyptians if they had

129
00:13:08,53 --> 00:13:14,53
 not hearkened unto the words of the Lord

130
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:19,093
24 Yea, do ye suppose that they would have been

131
00:13:19,093 --> 00:13:24,093
 led out of bondage, if the Lord had not commanded

132
00:13:24,093 --> 00:13:29,093
 Moses that he should lead them out of bondage

133
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:35,375
25 Now ye know that the children of Israel were in

134
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:41,175
 bondage; and ye know that they were laden with

135
00:13:41,175 --> 00:13:46,975
 tasks, which were grievous to be borne; wherefore,

136
00:13:46,975 --> 00:13:52,775
 ye know that it must needs be a good thing for

137
00:13:52,775 --> 00:13:58,575
 them, that they should be brought out of bondage

138
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:03,938
26 Now ye know that Moses was commanded of the

139
00:14:03,938 --> 00:14:09,338
 Lord to do that great work; and ye know that by his

140
00:14:09,338 --> 00:14:14,738
 word the waters of the Red Sea were divided hither

141
00:14:14,738 --> 00:14:20,138
 and thither, and they passed through on dry

142
00:14:20,138 --> 00:14:25,538
 ground

143
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:31,031
27 But ye know that the Egyptians were drowned in

144
00:14:31,031 --> 00:14:37,031
 the Red Sea, who were the armies of Pharaoh

145
00:14:37,91 --> 00:14:43,91
28 And ye also know that they were fed with manna

146
00:14:43,91 --> 00:14:49,91
 in the wilderness

147
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:55,905
29 Yea, and ye also know that Moses, by his word

148
00:14:55,905 --> 00:15:02,155
 according to the power of God which was in him,

149
00:15:02,155 --> 00:15:08,405
 smote the rock, and there came forth water, that the

150
00:15:08,405 --> 00:15:14,655
 children of Israel might quench their thirst

151
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:21,804
30 And notwithstanding they being led, the Lord

152
00:15:21,804 --> 00:15:28,661
 their God, their Redeemer, going before them,

153
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:35,518
 leading them by day and giving light unto them by night,

154
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:42,375
 and doing all things for them which were

155
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:49,232
 expedient for man to receive, they hardened their hearts

156
00:15:49,232 --> 00:15:56,089
 and blinded their minds, and reviled against Moses

157
00:15:56,089 --> 00:16:02,946
 and against the true and living God

158
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:08,995
31 And it came to pass that according to his word

159
00:16:08,995 --> 00:16:14,995
 he did destroy them; and according to his word he

160
00:16:14,995 --> 00:16:20,995
 did lead them; and according to his word he did do

161
00:16:20,995 --> 00:16:26,995
 all things for them; and there was not any thing

162
00:16:26,995 --> 00:16:32,995
 done save it were by his word

163
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:37,692
32 And after they had crossed the river Jordan he

164
00:16:37,692 --> 00:16:42,692
 did make them mighty unto the driving out of the

165
00:16:42,692 --> 00:16:47,692
 children of the land, yea, unto the scattering them

166
00:16:47,692 --> 00:16:52,692
 to destruction

167
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:58,928
33 And now, do ye suppose that the children of

168
00:16:58,928 --> 00:17:05,178
 this land, who were in the land of promise, who were

169
00:17:05,178 --> 00:17:11,428
 driven out by our fathers, do ye suppose that they

170
00:17:11,428 --> 00:17:17,678
 were righteous? Behold, I say unto you, Nay

171
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:22,436
34 Do ye suppose that our fathers would have been

172
00:17:22,436 --> 00:17:27,436
 more choice than they if they had been righteous?

173
00:17:27,436 --> 00:17:32,436
 I say unto you, Nay

174
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:39,697
35 Behold, the Lord esteemeth all flesh in one; he

175
00:17:39,697 --> 00:17:46,475
 that is righteous is favored of God. But behold,

176
00:17:46,475 --> 00:17:53,253
 this people had rejected every word of God, and

177
00:17:53,253 --> 00:18:00,031
 they were ripe in iniquity; and the fulness of the

178
00:18:00,031 --> 00:18:06,809
 wrath of God was upon them; and the Lord did curse

179
00:18:06,809 --> 00:18:13,587
 the land against them, and bless it unto our

180
00:18:13,587 --> 00:18:20,365
 fathers; yea, he did curse it against them unto their

181
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:27,143
 destruction, and he did bless it unto our fathers

182
00:18:27,143 --> 00:18:33,921
 unto their obtaining power over it

183
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:41,146
36 Behold, the Lord hath created the earth that it

184
00:18:41,146 --> 00:18:48,479
 should be inhabited; and he hath created his

185
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:55,812
 children that they should possess it

186
00:18:55,301 --> 00:19:01,301
37 And he raiseth up a righteous nation, and

187
00:19:01,301 --> 00:19:07,301
 destroyeth the nations of the wicked

188
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:14,28
38 And he leadeth away the righteous into precious

189
00:19:14,28 --> 00:19:20,947
 lands, and the wicked he destroyeth, and curseth

190
00:19:20,947 --> 00:19:27,614
 the land unto them for their sakes

191
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:35,133
39 He ruleth high in the heavens, for it is his

192
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:42,633
 throne, and this earth is his footstool

193
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:49,549
40 And he loveth those who will have him to be

194
00:19:49,549 --> 00:19:56,216
 their God. Behold, he loved our fathers, and he

195
00:19:56,216 --> 00:20:02,883
 covenanted with them, yea, even Abraham, Isaac, and

196
00:20:02,883 --> 00:20:09,55
 Jacob; and he remembered the covenants which he had

197
00:20:09,55 --> 00:20:16,217
 made; wherefore, he did bring them out of the land

198
00:20:16,217 --> 00:20:22,884
 of Egypt

199
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:28,977
41 And he did straiten them in the wilderness with

200
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:35,199
 his rod; for they hardened their hearts, even as

201
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:41,421
 ye have; and the Lord straitened them because of

202
00:20:41,421 --> 00:20:47,643
 their iniquity. He sent fiery flying serpents among

203
00:20:47,643 --> 00:20:53,865
 them; and after they were bitten he prepared a

204
00:20:53,865 --> 00:21:00,087
 way that they might be healed; and the labor which

205
00:21:00,087 --> 00:21:06,309
 they had to perform was to look; and because of the

206
00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:12,531
 simpleness of the way, or the easiness of it,

207
00:21:12,531 --> 00:21:18,753
 there were many who perished

208
00:21:18,31 --> 00:21:23,31
42 And they did harden their hearts from time to

209
00:21:23,31 --> 00:21:28,31
 time, and they did revile against Moses, and also

210
00:21:28,31 --> 00:21:33,31
 against God; nevertheless, ye know that they were

211
00:21:33,31 --> 00:21:38,31
 led forth by his matchless power into the land of

212
00:21:38,31 --> 00:21:43,31
 promise

213
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:49,468
43 And now, after all these things, the time has

214
00:21:49,468 --> 00:21:55,801
 come that they have become wicked, yea, nearly unto

215
00:21:55,801 --> 00:22:02,134
 ripeness; and I know not but they are at this day

216
00:22:02,134 --> 00:22:08,467
 about to be destroyed; for I know that the day

217
00:22:08,467 --> 00:22:14,8
 must surely come that they must be destroyed, save a

218
00:22:14,8 --> 00:22:21,133
 few only, who shall be led away into captivity

219
00:22:21,34 --> 00:22:26,507
44 Wherefore, the Lord commanded my father that he

220
00:22:26,507 --> 00:22:31,674
 should depart into the wilderness; and the Jews

221
00:22:31,674 --> 00:22:36,841
 also sought to take away his life; yea, and ye also

222
00:22:36,841 --> 00:22:42,008
 have sought to take away his life; wherefore, ye

223
00:22:42,008 --> 00:22:47,175
 are murderers in your hearts and ye are like unto

224
00:22:47,175 --> 00:22:52,342
 them

225
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:58,427
45 Ye are swift to do iniquity but slow to

226
00:22:58,427 --> 00:23:04,316
 remember the Lord your God. Ye have seen an angel, and he

227
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:10,205
 spake unto you; yea, ye have heard his voice from

228
00:23:10,205 --> 00:23:16,094
 time to time; and he hath spoken unto you in a

229
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:21,983
 still small voice, but ye were past feeling, that ye

230
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:27,872
 could not feel his words; wherefore, he has

231
00:23:27,872 --> 00:23:33,761
 spoken unto you like unto the voice of thunder, which

232
00:23:33,761 --> 00:23:39,65
 did cause the earth to shake as if it were to

233
00:23:39,65 --> 00:23:45,539
 divide asunder

234
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:52,257
46 And ye also know that by the power of his

235
00:23:52,257 --> 00:23:59,09
 almighty word he can cause the earth that it shall pass

236
00:23:59,09 --> 00:24:05,923
 away; yea, and ye know that by his word he can

237
00:24:05,923 --> 00:24:12,756
 cause the rough places to be made smooth, and smooth

238
00:24:12,756 --> 00:24:19,589
 places shall be broken up. O, then, why is it,

239
00:24:19,589 --> 00:24:26,422
 that ye can be so hard in your hearts

240
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:32,665
47 Behold, my soul is rent with anguish because of

241
00:24:32,665 --> 00:24:38,665
 you, and my heart is pained; I fear lest ye shall

242
00:24:38,665 --> 00:24:44,665
 be cast off forever. Behold, I am full of the

243
00:24:44,665 --> 00:24:50,665
 Spirit of God, insomuch that my frame has no

244
00:24:50,665 --> 00:24:56,665
 strength

245
00:24:56,261 --> 00:25:02,625
48 And now it came to pass that when I had spoken

246
00:25:02,625 --> 00:25:08,989
 these words they were angry with me, and were

247
00:25:08,989 --> 00:25:15,353
 desirous to throw me into the depths of the sea; and

248
00:25:15,353 --> 00:25:21,717
 as they came forth to lay their hands upon me I

249
00:25:21,717 --> 00:25:28,081
 spake unto them, saying: In the name of the Almighty

250
00:25:28,081 --> 00:25:34,445
 God, I command you that ye touch me not, for I am

251
00:25:34,445 --> 00:25:40,809
 filled with the power of God, even unto the

252
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:47,173
 consuming of my flesh; and whoso shall lay his hands

253
00:25:47,173 --> 00:25:53,537
 upon me shall wither even as a dried reed; and he

254
00:25:53,537 --> 00:25:59,901
 shall be as naught before the power of God, for God

255
00:25:59,901 --> 00:26:06,265
 shall smite him

256
00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:12,098
49 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto

257
00:26:12,098 --> 00:26:18,098
 them that they should murmur no more against their

258
00:26:18,098 --> 00:26:24,098
 father; neither should they withhold their labor

259
00:26:24,098 --> 00:26:30,098
 from me, for God had commanded me that I should

260
00:26:30,098 --> 00:26:36,098
 build a ship

261
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:41,495
50 And I said unto them: If God had commanded me

262
00:26:41,495 --> 00:26:46,895
 to do all things I could do them. If he should

263
00:26:46,895 --> 00:26:52,295
 command me that I should say unto this water, be thou

264
00:26:52,295 --> 00:26:57,695
 earth, it should be earth; and if I should say it,

265
00:26:57,695 --> 00:27:03,095
 it would be done

266
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:10,089
51 And now, if the Lord has such great power, and

267
00:27:10,089 --> 00:27:16,589
 has wrought so many miracles among the children of

268
00:27:16,589 --> 00:27:23,089
 men, how is it that he cannot instruct me, that I

269
00:27:23,089 --> 00:27:29,589
 should build a ship

270
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:36,848
52 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said many

271
00:27:36,848 --> 00:27:43,848
 things unto my brethren, insomuch that they were

272
00:27:43,848 --> 00:27:50,848
 confounded and could not contend against me; neither

273
00:27:50,848 --> 00:27:57,848
 durst they lay their hands upon me nor touch me

274
00:27:57,848 --> 00:28:04,848
 with their fingers, even for the space of many days.

275
00:28:04,848 --> 00:28:11,848
 Now they durst not do this lest they should

276
00:28:11,848 --> 00:28:18,848
 wither before me, so powerful was the Spirit of God;

277
00:28:18,848 --> 00:28:25,848
 and thus it had wrought upon them

278
00:28:25,07 --> 00:28:31,47
53 And it came to pass that the Lord said unto me:

279
00:28:31,47 --> 00:28:37,87
 Stretch forth thine hand again unto thy brethren,

280
00:28:37,87 --> 00:28:44,27
 and they shall not wither before thee, but I will

281
00:28:44,27 --> 00:28:50,67
 shock them, saith the Lord, and this will I do,

282
00:28:50,67 --> 00:28:57,07
 that they may know that I am the Lord their God

283
00:28:57,703 --> 00:29:02,703
54 And it came to pass that I stretched forth my

284
00:29:02,703 --> 00:29:07,703
 hand unto my brethren, and they did not wither

285
00:29:07,703 --> 00:29:12,703
 before me; but the Lord did shake them, even according

286
00:29:12,703 --> 00:29:17,703
 to the word which he had spoken

287
00:29:17,656 --> 00:29:18,989
55 And now, they said: We know of a surety that

288
00:29:18,989 --> 00:29:20,322
 the Lord is with thee, for we know that it is the

289
00:29:20,322 --> 00:29:21,655
 power of the Lord that has shaken us. And they fell

290
00:29:21,655 --> 00:29:22,988
 down before me, and were about to worship me, but

291
00:29:22,988 --> 00:29:24,321
 I would not suffer them, saying: I am thy brother,

292
00:29:24,321 --> 00:29:25,654
 yea, even thy younger brother; wherefore, worship

293
00:29:25,654 --> 00:29:26,987
 the Lord thy God, and honor thy father and thy

294
00:29:26,987 --> 00:29:28,32
 mother, that thy days may be long in the land which

295
00:29:28,32 --> 00:29:29,653
 the Lord thy God shall give thee.
