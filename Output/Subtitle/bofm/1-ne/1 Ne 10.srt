1
00:00:00,4 --> 00:00:08,7
Chapter 10 Lehi predicts that the Jews will be

2
00:00:08,7 --> 00:00:17,0
 taken captive by the Babylonians—He tells of the

3
00:00:17,0 --> 00:00:25,3
 coming among the Jews of a Messiah, a Savior, a

4
00:00:25,3 --> 00:00:33,6
 Redeemer—Lehi tells also of the coming of the one who

5
00:00:33,6 --> 00:00:41,9
 should baptize the Lamb of God—Lehi tells of the

6
00:00:41,9 --> 00:00:50,2
 death and resurrection of the Messiah—He compares the

7
00:00:50,2 --> 00:00:58,5
 scattering and gathering of Israel to an olive

8
00:00:58,5 --> 00:01:06,8
 tree—Nephi speaks of the Son of God, of the gift of

9
00:01:06,8 --> 00:01:15,1
 the Holy Ghost, and of the need for righteousness.

10
00:01:15,1 --> 00:01:23,4
 About 600–592 B.C.

11
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:26,717
1 And now I, Nephi, proceed to give an account

12
00:01:26,717 --> 00:01:29,917
 upon these plates of my proceedings, and my reign and

13
00:01:29,917 --> 00:01:33,117
 ministry; wherefore, to proceed with mine

14
00:01:33,117 --> 00:01:36,317
 account, I must speak somewhat of the things of my

15
00:01:36,317 --> 00:01:39,517
 father, and also of my brethren

16
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:48,466
2 For behold, it came to pass after my father had

17
00:01:48,466 --> 00:01:57,466
 made an end of speaking the words of his dream,

18
00:01:57,466 --> 00:02:06,466
 and also of exhorting them to all diligence, he

19
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:15,466
 spake unto them concerning the Jews

20
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:22,035
3 That after they should be destroyed, even that

21
00:02:22,035 --> 00:02:29,035
 great city Jerusalem, and many be carried away

22
00:02:29,035 --> 00:02:36,035
 captive into Babylon, according to the own due time of

23
00:02:36,035 --> 00:02:43,035
 the Lord, they should return again, yea, even be

24
00:02:43,035 --> 00:02:50,035
 brought back out of captivity; and after they

25
00:02:50,035 --> 00:02:57,035
 should be brought back out of captivity they should

26
00:02:57,035 --> 00:03:04,035
 possess again the land of their inheritance

27
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:12,201
4 Yea, even six hundred years from the time that

28
00:03:12,201 --> 00:03:19,951
 my father left Jerusalem, a prophet would the Lord

29
00:03:19,951 --> 00:03:27,701
 God raise up among the Jews—even a Messiah, or, in

30
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:35,451
 other words, a Savior of the world

31
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:41,732
5 And he also spake concerning the prophets, how

32
00:03:41,732 --> 00:03:47,982
 great a number had testified of these things,

33
00:03:47,982 --> 00:03:54,232
 concerning this Messiah, of whom he had spoken, or this

34
00:03:54,232 --> 00:04:00,482
 Redeemer of the world

35
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:07,174
6 Wherefore, all mankind were in a lost and in a

36
00:04:07,174 --> 00:04:13,841
 fallen state, and ever would be save they should

37
00:04:13,841 --> 00:04:20,508
 rely on this Redeemer

38
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:26,527
7 And he spake also concerning a prophet who

39
00:04:26,527 --> 00:04:32,527
 should come before the Messiah, to prepare the way of

40
00:04:32,527 --> 00:04:38,527
 the Lord

41
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:46,411
8 Yea, even he should go forth and cry in the

42
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:54,244
 wilderness: Prepare ye the way of the Lord, and make

43
00:04:54,244 --> 00:05:02,077
 his paths straight; for there standeth one among

44
00:05:02,077 --> 00:05:09,91
 you whom ye know not; and he is mightier than I,

45
00:05:09,91 --> 00:05:17,743
 whose shoe’s latchet I am not worthy to unloose. And

46
00:05:17,743 --> 00:05:25,576
 much spake my father concerning this thing

47
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:32,225
9 And my father said he should baptize in

48
00:05:32,225 --> 00:05:39,225
 Bethabara, beyond Jordan; and he also said he should

49
00:05:39,225 --> 00:05:46,225
 baptize with water; even that he should baptize the

50
00:05:46,225 --> 00:05:53,225
 Messiah with water

51
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:58,903
10 And after he had baptized the Messiah with

52
00:05:58,903 --> 00:06:04,653
 water, he should behold and bear record that he had

53
00:06:04,653 --> 00:06:10,403
 baptized the Lamb of God, who should take away the

54
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:16,153
 sins of the world

55
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:22,501
11 And it came to pass after my father had spoken

56
00:06:22,501 --> 00:06:28,626
 these words he spake unto my brethren concerning

57
00:06:28,626 --> 00:06:34,751
 the gospel which should be preached among the Jews,

58
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:40,876
 and also concerning the dwindling of the Jews in

59
00:06:40,876 --> 00:06:47,001
 unbelief. And after they had slain the Messiah,

60
00:06:47,001 --> 00:06:53,126
 who should come, and after he had been slain he

61
00:06:53,126 --> 00:06:59,251
 should rise from the dead, and should make himself

62
00:06:59,251 --> 00:07:05,376
 manifest, by the Holy Ghost, unto the Gentiles

63
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:12,692
12 Yea, even my father spake much concerning the

64
00:07:12,692 --> 00:07:19,692
 Gentiles, and also concerning the house of Israel,

65
00:07:19,692 --> 00:07:26,692
 that they should be compared like unto an olive

66
00:07:26,692 --> 00:07:33,692
 tree, whose branches should be broken off and should

67
00:07:33,692 --> 00:07:40,692
 be scattered upon all the face of the earth

68
00:07:40,16 --> 00:07:44,96
13 Wherefore, he said it must needs be that we

69
00:07:44,96 --> 00:07:49,76
 should be led with one accord into the land of

70
00:07:49,76 --> 00:07:54,56
 promise, unto the fulfilling of the word of the Lord,

71
00:07:54,56 --> 00:07:59,36
 that we should be scattered upon all the face of the

72
00:07:59,36 --> 00:08:04,16
 earth

73
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:11,603
14 And after the house of Israel should be

74
00:08:11,603 --> 00:08:18,889
 scattered they should be gathered together again; or, in

75
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:26,175
 fine, after the Gentiles had received the fulness

76
00:08:26,175 --> 00:08:33,461
 of the Gospel, the natural branches of the olive

77
00:08:33,461 --> 00:08:40,747
 tree, or the remnants of the house of Israel,

78
00:08:40,747 --> 00:08:48,033
 should be grafted in, or come to the knowledge of the

79
00:08:48,033 --> 00:08:55,319
 true Messiah, their Lord and their Redeemer

80
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:59,901
15 And after this manner of language did my father

81
00:08:59,901 --> 00:09:04,701
 prophesy and speak unto my brethren, and also

82
00:09:04,701 --> 00:09:09,501
 many more things which I do not write in this book;

83
00:09:09,501 --> 00:09:14,301
 for I have written as many of them as were

84
00:09:14,301 --> 00:09:19,101
 expedient for me in mine other book

85
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:27,358
16 And all these things, of which I have spoken,

86
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:35,691
 were done as my father dwelt in a tent, in the

87
00:09:35,691 --> 00:09:44,024
 valley of Lemuel

88
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,251
17 And it came to pass after I, Nephi, having

89
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:45,918
 heard all the words of my father, concerning the

90
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:46,585
 things which he saw in a vision, and also the things

91
00:09:46,585 --> 00:09:47,252
 which he spake by the power of the Holy Ghost, which

92
00:09:47,252 --> 00:09:47,919
 power he received by faith on the Son of God—and

93
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:48,586
 the Son of God was the Messiah who should come—I,

94
00:09:48,586 --> 00:09:49,253
 Nephi, was desirous also that I might see, and

95
00:09:49,253 --> 00:09:49,92
 hear, and know of these things, by the power of the

96
00:09:49,92 --> 00:09:50,587
 Holy Ghost, which is the gift of God unto all those

97
00:09:50,587 --> 00:09:51,254
 who diligently seek him, as well in times of old

98
00:09:51,254 --> 00:09:51,921
 as in the time that he should manifest himself

99
00:09:51,921 --> 00:09:52,588
 unto the children of men

100
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:58,559
18 For he is the same yesterday, today, and

101
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:04,559
 forever; and the way is prepared for all men from the

102
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:10,559
 foundation of the world, if it so be that they

103
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:16,559
 repent and come unto him

104
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:17,816
19 For he that diligently seeketh shall find; and

105
00:10:17,816 --> 00:10:19,149
 the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto them,

106
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:20,482
 by the power of the Holy Ghost, as well in these

107
00:10:20,482 --> 00:10:21,815
 times as in times of old, and as well in times of

108
00:10:21,815 --> 00:10:23,148
 old as in times to come; wherefore, the course of

109
00:10:23,148 --> 00:10:24,481
 the Lord is one eternal round

110
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:32,457
20 Therefore remember, O man, for all thy doings

111
00:10:32,457 --> 00:10:40,457
 thou shalt be brought into judgment

112
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:43,606
21 Wherefore, if ye have sought to do wickedly in

113
00:10:43,606 --> 00:10:46,806
 the days of your probation, then ye are found

114
00:10:46,806 --> 00:10:50,006
 unclean before the judgment-seat of God; and no

115
00:10:50,006 --> 00:10:53,206
 unclean thing can dwell with God; wherefore, ye must be

116
00:10:53,206 --> 00:10:56,406
 cast off forever

117
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:56,856
22 And the Holy Ghost giveth authority that I

118
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:57,356
 should speak these things, and deny them not.
