1
00:00:00,4 --> 00:00:09,257
Chapter 15 Lehi’s seed are to receive the gospel

2
00:00:09,257 --> 00:00:18,114
 from the Gentiles in the latter days—The gathering

3
00:00:18,114 --> 00:00:26,971
 of Israel is likened unto an olive tree whose

4
00:00:26,971 --> 00:00:35,828
 natural branches will be grafted in again—Nephi

5
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:44,685
 interprets the vision of the tree of life and speaks of

6
00:00:44,685 --> 00:00:53,542
 the justice of God in dividing the wicked from the

7
00:00:53,542 --> 00:01:02,399
 righteous. About 600–592 B.C.

8
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:08,962
1 And it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had

9
00:01:08,962 --> 00:01:15,295
 been carried away in the Spirit, and seen all these

10
00:01:15,295 --> 00:01:21,628
 things, I returned to the tent of my father

11
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:26,248
2 And it came to pass that I beheld my brethren,

12
00:01:26,248 --> 00:01:31,248
 and they were disputing one with another concerning

13
00:01:31,248 --> 00:01:36,248
 the things which my father had spoken unto them

14
00:01:36,73 --> 00:01:41,93
3 For he truly spake many great things unto them,

15
00:01:41,93 --> 00:01:47,13
 which were hard to be understood, save a man

16
00:01:47,13 --> 00:01:52,33
 should inquire of the Lord; and they being hard in

17
00:01:52,33 --> 00:01:57,53
 their hearts, therefore they did not look unto the

18
00:01:57,53 --> 00:02:02,73
 Lord as they ought

19
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:08,089
4 And now I, Nephi, was grieved because of the

20
00:02:08,089 --> 00:02:13,689
 hardness of their hearts, and also, because of the

21
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:19,289
 things which I had seen, and knew they must

22
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:24,889
 unavoidably come to pass because of the great wickedness

23
00:02:24,889 --> 00:02:30,489
 of the children of men

24
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:37,067
5 And it came to pass that I was overcome because

25
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:43,817
 of my afflictions, for I considered that mine

26
00:02:43,817 --> 00:02:50,567
 afflictions were great above all, because of the

27
00:02:50,567 --> 00:02:57,317
 destruction of my people, for I had beheld their fall

28
00:02:57,577 --> 00:03:02,91
6 And it came to pass that after I had received

29
00:03:02,91 --> 00:03:08,243
 strength I spake unto my brethren, desiring to know

30
00:03:08,243 --> 00:03:13,576
 of them the cause of their disputations

31
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:19,477
7 And they said: Behold, we cannot understand the

32
00:03:19,477 --> 00:03:25,227
 words which our father hath spoken concerning the

33
00:03:25,227 --> 00:03:30,977
 natural branches of the olive tree, and also

34
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:36,727
 concerning the Gentiles

35
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,216
8 And I said unto them: Have ye inquired of the

36
00:03:39,216 --> 00:03:42,216
 Lord

37
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:47,956
9 And they said unto me: We have not; for the Lord

38
00:03:47,956 --> 00:03:52,956
 maketh no such thing known unto us

39
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:57,249
10 Behold, I said unto them: How is it that ye do

40
00:03:57,249 --> 00:04:01,499
 not keep the commandments of the Lord? How is it

41
00:04:01,499 --> 00:04:05,749
 that ye will perish, because of the hardness of

42
00:04:05,749 --> 00:04:09,999
 your hearts

43
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:15,616
11 Do ye not remember the things which the Lord

44
00:04:15,616 --> 00:04:21,416
 hath said?—If ye will not harden your hearts, and

45
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:27,216
 ask me in faith, believing that ye shall receive,

46
00:04:27,216 --> 00:04:33,016
 with diligence in keeping my commandments, surely

47
00:04:33,016 --> 00:04:38,816
 these things shall be made known unto you

48
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:45,545
12 Behold, I say unto you, that the house of

49
00:04:45,545 --> 00:04:52,545
 Israel was compared unto an olive tree, by the Spirit

50
00:04:52,545 --> 00:04:59,545
 of the Lord which was in our father; and behold are

51
00:04:59,545 --> 00:05:06,545
 we not broken off from the house of Israel, and

52
00:05:06,545 --> 00:05:13,545
 are we not a branch of the house of Israel

53
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:19,846
13 And now, the thing which our father meaneth

54
00:05:19,846 --> 00:05:26,446
 concerning the grafting in of the natural branches

55
00:05:26,446 --> 00:05:33,046
 through the fulness of the Gentiles, is, that in the

56
00:05:33,046 --> 00:05:39,646
 latter days, when our seed shall have dwindled in

57
00:05:39,646 --> 00:05:46,246
 unbelief, yea, for the space of many years, and

58
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:52,846
 many generations after the Messiah shall be

59
00:05:52,846 --> 00:05:59,446
 manifested in body unto the children of men, then shall

60
00:05:59,446 --> 00:06:06,046
 the fulness of the gospel of the Messiah come unto

61
00:06:06,046 --> 00:06:12,646
 the Gentiles, and from the Gentiles unto the

62
00:06:12,646 --> 00:06:19,246
 remnant of our seed

63
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:26,112
14 And at that day shall the remnant of our seed

64
00:06:26,112 --> 00:06:32,812
 know that they are of the house of Israel, and that

65
00:06:32,812 --> 00:06:39,512
 they are the covenant people of the Lord; and

66
00:06:39,512 --> 00:06:46,212
 then shall they know and come to the knowledge of

67
00:06:46,212 --> 00:06:52,912
 their forefathers, and also to the knowledge of the

68
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:59,612
 gospel of their Redeemer, which was ministered unto

69
00:06:59,612 --> 00:07:06,312
 their fathers by him; wherefore, they shall come

70
00:07:06,312 --> 00:07:13,012
 to the knowledge of their Redeemer and the very

71
00:07:13,012 --> 00:07:19,712
 points of his doctrine, that they may know how to

72
00:07:19,712 --> 00:07:26,412
 come unto him and be saved

73
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:32,945
15 And then at that day will they not rejoice and

74
00:07:32,945 --> 00:07:39,778
 give praise unto their everlasting God, their rock

75
00:07:39,778 --> 00:07:46,611
 and their salvation? Yea, at that day, will they

76
00:07:46,611 --> 00:07:53,444
 not receive the strength and nourishment from the

77
00:07:53,444 --> 00:08:00,277
 true vine? Yea, will they not come unto the true

78
00:08:00,277 --> 00:08:07,11
 fold of God

79
00:08:07,32 --> 00:08:13,57
16 Behold, I say unto you, Yea; they shall be

80
00:08:13,57 --> 00:08:19,82
 remembered again among the house of Israel; they shall

81
00:08:19,82 --> 00:08:26,07
 be grafted in, being a natural branch of the

82
00:08:26,07 --> 00:08:32,32
 olive tree, into the true olive tree

83
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:38,935
17 And this is what our father meaneth; and he

84
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:45,792
 meaneth that it will not come to pass until after

85
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:52,649
 they are scattered by the Gentiles; and he meaneth

86
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:59,506
 that it shall come by way of the Gentiles, that the

87
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:06,363
 Lord may show his power unto the Gentiles, for the

88
00:09:06,363 --> 00:09:13,22
 very cause that he shall be rejected of the Jews,

89
00:09:13,22 --> 00:09:20,077
 or of the house of Israel

90
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:27,593
18 Wherefore, our father hath not spoken of our

91
00:09:27,593 --> 00:09:35,093
 seed alone, but also of all the house of Israel,

92
00:09:35,093 --> 00:09:42,593
 pointing to the covenant which should be fulfilled in

93
00:09:42,593 --> 00:09:50,093
 the latter days; which covenant the Lord made to

94
00:09:50,093 --> 00:09:57,593
 our father Abraham, saying: In thy seed shall all

95
00:09:57,593 --> 00:10:05,093
 the kindreds of the earth be blessed

96
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:10,988
19 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, spake much

97
00:10:10,988 --> 00:10:16,238
 unto them concerning these things; yea, I spake

98
00:10:16,238 --> 00:10:21,488
 unto them concerning the restoration of the Jews in

99
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:26,738
 the latter days

100
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:32,309
20 And I did rehearse unto them the words of

101
00:10:32,309 --> 00:10:38,059
 Isaiah, who spake concerning the restoration of the

102
00:10:38,059 --> 00:10:43,809
 Jews, or of the house of Israel; and after they were

103
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:49,559
 restored they should no more be confounded,

104
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:55,309
 neither should they be scattered again. And it came to

105
00:10:55,309 --> 00:11:01,059
 pass that I did speak many words unto my brethren,

106
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:06,809
 that they were pacified and did humble themselves

107
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:12,559
 before the Lord

108
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:16,989
21 And it came to pass that they did speak unto me

109
00:11:16,989 --> 00:11:21,239
 again, saying: What meaneth this thing which our

110
00:11:21,239 --> 00:11:25,489
 father saw in a dream? What meaneth the tree which

111
00:11:25,489 --> 00:11:29,739
 he saw

112
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:33,155
22 And I said unto them: It was a representation

113
00:11:33,155 --> 00:11:37,155
 of the tree of life

114
00:11:37,83 --> 00:11:43,83
23 And they said unto me: What meaneth the rod of

115
00:11:43,83 --> 00:11:49,83
 iron which our father saw, that led to the tree

116
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:55,476
24 And I said unto them that it was the word of

117
00:11:55,476 --> 00:12:01,143
 God; and whoso would hearken unto the word of God,

118
00:12:01,143 --> 00:12:06,81
 and would hold fast unto it, they would never

119
00:12:06,81 --> 00:12:12,477
 perish; neither could the temptations and the fiery

120
00:12:12,477 --> 00:12:18,144
 darts of the adversary overpower them unto blindness,

121
00:12:18,144 --> 00:12:23,811
 to lead them away to destruction

122
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:29,743
25 Wherefore, I, Nephi, did exhort them to give

123
00:12:29,743 --> 00:12:35,743
 heed unto the word of the Lord; yea, I did exhort

124
00:12:35,743 --> 00:12:41,743
 them with all the energies of my soul, and with all

125
00:12:41,743 --> 00:12:47,743
 the faculty which I possessed, that they would

126
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:53,743
 give heed to the word of God and remember to keep his

127
00:12:53,743 --> 00:12:59,743
 commandments always in all things

128
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:04,245
26 And they said unto me: What meaneth the river

129
00:13:04,245 --> 00:13:09,245
 of water which our father saw

130
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:14,555
27 And I said unto them that the water which my

131
00:13:14,555 --> 00:13:20,055
 father saw was filthiness; and so much was his mind

132
00:13:20,055 --> 00:13:25,555
 swallowed up in other things that he beheld not

133
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:31,055
 the filthiness of the water

134
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:52,644
28 And I said unto them that it was an awful gulf,

135
00:13:52,644 --> 00:14:13,976
 which separated the wicked from the tree of life,

136
00:14:13,976 --> 00:14:35,31
 and also from the saints of God

137
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:45,775
29 And I said unto them that it was a

138
00:14:45,775 --> 00:14:56,442
 representation of that awful hell, which the angel said unto

139
00:14:56,442 --> 00:15:07,109
 me was prepared for the wicked

140
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:13,506
30 And I said unto them that our father also saw

141
00:15:13,506 --> 00:15:20,006
 that the justice of God did also divide the wicked

142
00:15:20,006 --> 00:15:26,506
 from the righteous; and the brightness thereof was

143
00:15:26,506 --> 00:15:33,006
 like unto the brightness of a flaming fire, which

144
00:15:33,006 --> 00:15:39,506
 ascendeth up unto God forever and ever, and hath

145
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:46,006
 no end

146
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,479
31 And they said unto me: Doth this thing mean the

147
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,079
 torment of the body in the days of probation, or

148
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,679
 doth it mean the final state of the soul after the

149
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:53,279
 death of the temporal body, or doth it speak of

150
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,879
 the things which are temporal

151
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:55,021
32 And it came to pass that I said unto them that

152
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:55,188
 it was a representation of things both temporal

153
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:55,355
 and spiritual; for the day should come that they

154
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:55,522
 must be judged of their works, yea, even the works

155
00:15:55,522 --> 00:15:55,689
 which were done by the temporal body in their days

156
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:55,856
 of probation

157
00:15:55,321 --> 00:16:00,21
33 Wherefore, if they should die in their

158
00:16:00,21 --> 00:16:05,099
 wickedness they must be cast off also, as to the things

159
00:16:05,099 --> 00:16:09,988
 which are spiritual, which are pertaining to

160
00:16:09,988 --> 00:16:14,877
 righteousness; wherefore, they must be brought to stand

161
00:16:14,877 --> 00:16:19,766
 before God, to be judged of their works; and if

162
00:16:19,766 --> 00:16:24,655
 their works have been filthiness they must needs be

163
00:16:24,655 --> 00:16:29,544
 filthy; and if they be filthy it must needs be that

164
00:16:29,544 --> 00:16:34,433
 they cannot dwell in the kingdom of God; if so,

165
00:16:34,433 --> 00:16:39,322
 the kingdom of God must be filthy also

166
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:45,065
34 But behold, I say unto you, the kingdom of God

167
00:16:45,065 --> 00:16:50,465
 is not filthy, and there cannot any unclean thing

168
00:16:50,465 --> 00:16:55,865
 enter into the kingdom of God; wherefore there

169
00:16:55,865 --> 00:17:01,265
 must needs be a place of filthiness prepared for that

170
00:17:01,265 --> 00:17:06,665
 which is filthy

171
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:13,093
35 And there is a place prepared, yea, even that

172
00:17:13,093 --> 00:17:19,26
 awful hell of which I have spoken, and the devil is

173
00:17:19,26 --> 00:17:25,427
 the preparator of it; wherefore the final state

174
00:17:25,427 --> 00:17:31,594
 of the souls of men is to dwell in the kingdom of

175
00:17:31,594 --> 00:17:37,761
 God, or to be cast out because of that justice of

176
00:17:37,761 --> 00:17:43,928
 which I have spoken

177
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,229
36 Wherefore, the wicked are rejected from the

178
00:17:45,229 --> 00:17:46,729
 righteous, and also from that tree of life, whose

179
00:17:46,729 --> 00:17:48,229
 fruit is most precious and most desirable above all

180
00:17:48,229 --> 00:17:49,729
 other fruits; yea, and it is the greatest of all

181
00:17:49,729 --> 00:17:51,229
 the gifts of God. And thus I spake unto my brethren.

182
00:17:51,229 --> 00:17:52,729
 Amen.
