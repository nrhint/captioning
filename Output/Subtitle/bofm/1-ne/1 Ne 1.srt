00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:02,0
The First Book of NephiHis Reign and MinistryAn account of 

2
00:00:02,0 --> 00:00:04,0
Lehi and his wife Sariah, and his four sons, being 

3
00:00:04,0 --> 00:00:06,0
called, (beginning at the eldest) Laman, Lemuel, Sam, and Nephi. 

4
00:00:06,0 --> 00:00:08,0
The Lord warns Lehi to depart out of the land 

5
00:00:08,0 --> 00:00:10,0
of Jerusalem, because he prophesieth unto the people concerning their 

6
00:00:10,0 --> 00:00:12,0
iniquity and they seek to destroy his life. He taketh 

7
00:00:12,0 --> 00:00:14,0
three days’ journey into the wilderness with his family. Nephi 

8
00:00:14,0 --> 00:00:16,0
taketh his brethren and returneth to the land of Jerusalem 

9
00:00:16,0 --> 00:00:18,0
after the record of the Jews. The account of their 

10
00:00:18,0 --> 00:00:20,0
sufferings. They take the daughters of Ishmael to wife. They 

11
00:00:20,0 --> 00:00:22,0
take their families and depart into the wilderness. Their sufferings 

12
00:00:22,0 --> 00:00:24,0
and afflictions in the wilderness. The course of their travels. 

13
00:00:24,0 --> 00:00:26,0
They come to the large waters. Nephi’s brethren rebel against 

14
00:00:26,0 --> 00:00:28,0
him. He confoundeth them, and buildeth a ship. They call 

15
00:00:28,0 --> 00:00:30,0
the name of the place Bountiful. They cross the large 

16
00:00:30,0 --> 00:00:32,0
waters into the promised land, and so forth. This is 

17
00:00:32,0 --> 00:00:34,0
according to the account of Nephi; or in other words, 

18
00:00:34,0 --> 00:00:36,0
I, Nephi, wrote this record.Chapter 1 Nephi begins the record 

19
00:00:36,0 --> 00:00:38,0
of his people—Lehi sees in vision a pillar of fire 

20
00:00:38,0 --> 00:00:40,0
and reads from a book of prophecy—He praises God, foretells 

21
00:00:40,0 --> 00:00:42,0
the coming of the Messiah, and prophesies the destruction of 

22
00:00:42,0 --> 00:00:44,0
Jerusalem—He is persecuted by the Jews. About 600 B.C.  

23
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:49,958
1 I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore 

24
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:55,673
I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my 

25
00:00:55,673 --> 00:01:01,387
father; and having seen many afflictions in the course of 

26
00:01:01,387 --> 00:01:07,101
my days, nevertheless, having been highly favored of the Lord 

27
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:12,816
in all my days; yea, having had a great knowledge 

28
00:01:12,816 --> 00:01:18,53
of the goodness and the mysteries of God, therefore I 

29
00:01:18,53 --> 00:01:24,244
make a record of my proceedings in my days. 

30
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:36,784
2 Yea, I make a record in the language of 

31
00:01:36,784 --> 00:01:49,451
my father, which consists of the learning of the Jews 

32
00:01:49,451 --> 00:02:02,117
and the language of the Egyptians. 

33
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:09,889
3 And I know that the record which I make 

34
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:17,222
is true; and I make it with mine own hand; 

35
00:02:17,222 --> 00:02:24,556
and I make it according to my knowledge. 

36
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:32,511
4 For it came to pass in the commencement of 

37
00:02:32,511 --> 00:02:40,511
the first year of the reign of Zedekiah, king of 

38
00:02:40,511 --> 00:02:48,511
Judah, (my father, Lehi, having dwelt at Jerusalem in all 

39
00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:56,511
his days); and in that same year there came many 

40
00:02:56,511 --> 00:03:04,511
prophets, prophesying unto the people that they must repent, or 

41
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:12,511
the great city Jerusalem must be destroyed. 

42
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:20,459
5 Wherefore it came to pass that my father, Lehi, 

43
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:28,792
as he went forth prayed unto the Lord, yea, even 

44
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:37,125
with all his heart, in behalf of his people. 

45
00:03:37,15 --> 00:03:43,95
6 And it came to pass as he prayed unto 

46
00:03:43,95 --> 00:03:50,75
the Lord, there came a pillar of fire and dwelt 

47
00:03:50,75 --> 00:03:57,55
upon a rock before him; and he saw and heard 

48
00:03:57,55 --> 00:04:04,35
much; and because of the things which he saw and 

49
00:04:04,35 --> 00:04:11,15
heard he did quake and tremble exceedingly. 

50
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:17,385
7 And it came to pass that he returned to 

51
00:04:17,385 --> 00:04:22,885
his own house at Jerusalem; and he cast himself upon 

52
00:04:22,885 --> 00:04:28,385
his bed, being overcome with the Spirit and the things 

53
00:04:28,385 --> 00:04:33,885
which he had seen. 

54
00:04:33,84 --> 00:04:41,84
8 And being thus overcome with the Spirit, he was 

55
00:04:41,84 --> 00:04:49,84
carried away in a vision, even that he saw the 

56
00:04:49,84 --> 00:04:57,84
heavens open, and he thought he saw God sitting upon 

57
00:04:57,84 --> 00:05:05,84
his throne, surrounded with numberless concourses of angels in the 

58
00:05:05,84 --> 00:05:13,84
attitude of singing and praising their God. 

59
00:05:13,78 --> 00:05:19,03
9 And it came to pass that he saw One 

60
00:05:19,03 --> 00:05:24,28
descending out of the midst of heaven, and he beheld 

61
00:05:24,28 --> 00:05:29,53
that his luster was above that of the sun at 

62
00:05:29,53 --> 00:05:34,78
noon-day. 

63
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:40,734
10 And he also saw twelve others following him, and 

64
00:05:40,734 --> 00:05:47,4
their brightness did exceed that of the stars in the 

65
00:05:47,4 --> 00:05:54,067
firmament. 

66
00:05:54,02 --> 00:05:59,02
11 And they came down and went forth upon the 

67
00:05:59,02 --> 00:06:04,02
face of the earth; and the first came and stood 

68
00:06:04,02 --> 00:06:09,02
before my father, and gave unto him a book, and 

69
00:06:09,02 --> 00:06:14,02
bade him that he should read. 

70
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:18,574
12 And it came to pass that as he read, 

71
00:06:18,574 --> 00:06:23,074
he was filled with the Spirit of the Lord. 

72
00:06:23,95 --> 00:06:30,35
13 And he read, saying: Wo, wo, unto Jerusalem, for 

73
00:06:30,35 --> 00:06:36,75
I have seen thine abominations! Yea, and many things did 

74
00:06:36,75 --> 00:06:43,15
my father read concerning Jerusalem—that it should be destroyed, and 

75
00:06:43,15 --> 00:06:49,55
the inhabitants thereof; many should perish by the sword, and 

76
00:06:49,55 --> 00:06:55,95
many should be carried away captive into Babylon. 

77
00:06:55,849 --> 00:07:05,474
14 And it came to pass that when my father 

78
00:07:05,474 --> 00:07:15,099
had read and seen many great and marvelous things, he 

79
00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:24,724
did exclaim many things unto the Lord; such as: Great 

80
00:07:24,724 --> 00:07:34,349
and marvelous are thy works, O Lord God Almighty! Thy 

81
00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:43,974
throne is high in the heavens, and thy power, and 

82
00:07:43,974 --> 00:07:53,599
goodness, and mercy are over all the inhabitants of the 

83
00:07:53,599 --> 00:08:03,224
earth; and, because thou art merciful, thou wilt not suffer 

84
00:08:03,224 --> 00:08:12,849
those who come unto thee that they shall perish! 

85
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:19,692
15 And after this manner was the language of my 

86
00:08:19,692 --> 00:08:26,692
father in the praising of his God; for his soul 

87
00:08:26,692 --> 00:08:33,692
did rejoice, and his whole heart was filled, because of 

88
00:08:33,692 --> 00:08:40,692
the things which he had seen, yea, which the Lord 

89
00:08:40,692 --> 00:08:47,692
had shown unto him. 

90
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:54,693
16 And now I, Nephi, do not make a full 

91
00:08:54,693 --> 00:09:02,193
account of the things which my father hath written, for 

92
00:09:02,193 --> 00:09:09,693
he hath written many things which he saw in visions 

93
00:09:09,693 --> 00:09:17,193
and in dreams; and he also hath written many things 

94
00:09:17,193 --> 00:09:24,693
which he prophesied and spake unto his children, of which 

95
00:09:24,693 --> 00:09:32,193
I shall not make a full account. 

96
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:37,272
17 But I shall make an account of my proceedings 

97
00:09:37,272 --> 00:09:42,438
in my days. Behold, I make an abridgment of the 

98
00:09:42,438 --> 00:09:47,605
record of my father, upon plates which I have made 

99
00:09:47,605 --> 00:09:52,772
with mine own hands; wherefore, after I have abridged the 

100
00:09:52,772 --> 00:09:57,938
record of my father then will I make an account 

101
00:09:57,938 --> 00:10:03,105
of mine own life. 

102
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:09,87
18 Therefore, I would that ye should know, that after 

103
00:10:09,87 --> 00:10:16,203
the Lord had shown so many marvelous things unto my 

104
00:10:16,203 --> 00:10:22,536
father, Lehi, yea, concerning the destruction of Jerusalem, behold he 

105
00:10:22,536 --> 00:10:28,87
went forth among the people, and began to prophesy and 

106
00:10:28,87 --> 00:10:35,203
to declare unto them concerning the things which he had 

107
00:10:35,203 --> 00:10:41,536
both seen and heard. 

108
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:48,827
19 And it came to pass that the Jews did 

109
00:10:48,827 --> 00:10:56,112
mock him because of the things which he testified of 

110
00:10:56,112 --> 00:11:03,398
them; for he truly testified of their wickedness and their 

111
00:11:03,398 --> 00:11:10,684
abominations; and he testified that the things which he saw 

112
00:11:10,684 --> 00:11:17,969
and heard, and also the things which he read in 

113
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:25,255
the book, manifested plainly of the coming of a Messiah, 

114
00:11:25,255 --> 00:11:32,541
and also the redemption of the world. 

115
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:37,458
20 And when the Jews heard these things they were 

116
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:42,458
angry with him; yea, even as with the prophets of 

117
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:47,458
old, whom they had cast out, and stoned, and slain; 

118
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:52,458
and they also sought his life, that they might take 

119
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:57,458
it away. But behold, I, Nephi, will show unto you 

120
00:11:57,458 --> 00:12:02,458
that the tender mercies of the Lord are over all 

121
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:07,458
those whom he hath chosen, because of their faith, to 

122
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:12,458
make them mighty even unto the power of deliverance.
