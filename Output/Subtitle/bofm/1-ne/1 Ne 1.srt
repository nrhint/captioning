00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,692
The First Book of NephiHis Reign and MinistryAn

2
00:00:01,692 --> 00:00:03,384
 account of Lehi and his wife Sariah, and his four

3
00:00:03,384 --> 00:00:05,076
 sons, being called, (beginning at the eldest) Laman,

4
00:00:05,076 --> 00:00:06,768
 Lemuel, Sam, and Nephi. The Lord warns Lehi to

5
00:00:06,768 --> 00:00:08,46
 depart out of the land of Jerusalem, because he

6
00:00:08,46 --> 00:00:10,152
 prophesieth unto the people concerning their iniquity

7
00:00:10,152 --> 00:00:11,844
 and they seek to destroy his life. He taketh three

8
00:00:11,844 --> 00:00:13,536
 days’ journey into the wilderness with his

9
00:00:13,536 --> 00:00:15,228
 family. Nephi taketh his brethren and returneth to the

10
00:00:15,228 --> 00:00:16,92
 land of Jerusalem after the record of the Jews. The

11
00:00:16,92 --> 00:00:18,612
 account of their sufferings. They take the

12
00:00:18,612 --> 00:00:20,304
 daughters of Ishmael to wife. They take their families

13
00:00:20,304 --> 00:00:21,996
 and depart into the wilderness. Their sufferings

14
00:00:21,996 --> 00:00:23,688
 and afflictions in the wilderness. The course of

15
00:00:23,688 --> 00:00:25,38
 their travels. They come to the large waters. Nephi’s

16
00:00:25,38 --> 00:00:27,072
 brethren rebel against him. He confoundeth them,

17
00:00:27,072 --> 00:00:28,764
 and buildeth a ship. They call the name of the

18
00:00:28,764 --> 00:00:30,456
 place Bountiful. They cross the large waters into the

19
00:00:30,456 --> 00:00:32,148
 promised land, and so forth. This is according to

20
00:00:32,148 --> 00:00:33,84
 the account of Nephi; or in other words, I,

21
00:00:33,84 --> 00:00:35,532
 Nephi, wrote this record.Chapter 1 Nephi begins the

22
00:00:35,532 --> 00:00:37,224
 record of his people—Lehi sees in vision a pillar of

23
00:00:37,224 --> 00:00:38,916
 fire and reads from a book of prophecy—He praises

24
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:40,608
 God, foretells the coming of the Messiah, and

25
00:00:40,608 --> 00:00:42,3
 prophesies the destruction of Jerusalem—He is

26
00:00:42,3 --> 00:00:43,992
 persecuted by the Jews. About 600 B.C.

27
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:49,244
1 I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents,

28
00:00:49,244 --> 00:00:54,244
 therefore I was taught somewhat in all the learning

29
00:00:54,244 --> 00:00:59,244
 of my father; and having seen many afflictions in

30
00:00:59,244 --> 00:01:04,244
 the course of my days, nevertheless, having been

31
00:01:04,244 --> 00:01:09,244
 highly favored of the Lord in all my days; yea,

32
00:01:09,244 --> 00:01:14,244
 having had a great knowledge of the goodness and the

33
00:01:14,244 --> 00:01:19,244
 mysteries of God, therefore I make a record of my

34
00:01:19,244 --> 00:01:24,244
 proceedings in my days

35
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:36,784
2 Yea, I make a record in the language of my

36
00:01:36,784 --> 00:01:49,451
 father, which consists of the learning of the Jews and

37
00:01:49,451 --> 00:02:02,118
 the language of the Egyptians

38
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:09,889
3 And I know that the record which I make is true;

39
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:17,222
 and I make it with mine own hand; and I make it

40
00:02:17,222 --> 00:02:24,555
 according to my knowledge

41
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:31,368
4 For it came to pass in the commencement of the

42
00:02:31,368 --> 00:02:38,225
 first year of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah,

43
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:45,082
 (my father, Lehi, having dwelt at Jerusalem in

44
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:51,939
 all his days); and in that same year there came many

45
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:58,796
 prophets, prophesying unto the people that they

46
00:02:58,796 --> 00:03:05,653
 must repent, or the great city Jerusalem must be

47
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:12,51
 destroyed

48
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:20,458
5 Wherefore it came to pass that my father, Lehi,

49
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:28,791
 as he went forth prayed unto the Lord, yea, even

50
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:37,124
 with all his heart, in behalf of his people

51
00:03:37,15 --> 00:03:43,95
6 And it came to pass as he prayed unto the Lord,

52
00:03:43,95 --> 00:03:50,75
 there came a pillar of fire and dwelt upon a rock

53
00:03:50,75 --> 00:03:57,55
 before him; and he saw and heard much; and because

54
00:03:57,55 --> 00:04:04,35
 of the things which he saw and heard he did quake

55
00:04:04,35 --> 00:04:11,15
 and tremble exceedingly

56
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:17,385
7 And it came to pass that he returned to his own

57
00:04:17,385 --> 00:04:22,885
 house at Jerusalem; and he cast himself upon his

58
00:04:22,885 --> 00:04:28,385
 bed, being overcome with the Spirit and the things

59
00:04:28,385 --> 00:04:33,885
 which he had seen

60
00:04:33,84 --> 00:04:40,507
8 And being thus overcome with the Spirit, he was

61
00:04:40,507 --> 00:04:47,174
 carried away in a vision, even that he saw the

62
00:04:47,174 --> 00:04:53,841
 heavens open, and he thought he saw God sitting upon

63
00:04:53,841 --> 00:05:00,508
 his throne, surrounded with numberless concourses

64
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:07,175
 of angels in the attitude of singing and praising

65
00:05:07,175 --> 00:05:13,842
 their God

66
00:05:13,78 --> 00:05:20,78
9 And it came to pass that he saw One descending

67
00:05:20,78 --> 00:05:27,78
 out of the midst of heaven, and he beheld that his

68
00:05:27,78 --> 00:05:34,78
 luster was above that of the sun at noon-day

69
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:40,734
10 And he also saw twelve others following him,

70
00:05:40,734 --> 00:05:47,401
 and their brightness did exceed that of the stars in

71
00:05:47,401 --> 00:05:54,068
 the firmament

72
00:05:54,02 --> 00:05:59,02
11 And they came down and went forth upon the face

73
00:05:59,02 --> 00:06:04,02
 of the earth; and the first came and stood before

74
00:06:04,02 --> 00:06:09,02
 my father, and gave unto him a book, and bade him

75
00:06:09,02 --> 00:06:14,02
 that he should read

76
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:18,574
12 And it came to pass that as he read, he was

77
00:06:18,574 --> 00:06:23,074
 filled with the Spirit of the Lord

78
00:06:23,95 --> 00:06:29,283
13 And he read, saying: Wo, wo, unto Jerusalem,

79
00:06:29,283 --> 00:06:34,616
 for I have seen thine abominations! Yea, and many

80
00:06:34,616 --> 00:06:39,949
 things did my father read concerning Jerusalem—that

81
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:45,282
 it should be destroyed, and the inhabitants

82
00:06:45,282 --> 00:06:50,615
 thereof; many should perish by the sword, and many

83
00:06:50,615 --> 00:06:55,948
 should be carried away captive into Babylon

84
00:06:55,849 --> 00:07:04,405
14 And it came to pass that when my father had

85
00:07:04,405 --> 00:07:12,961
 read and seen many great and marvelous things, he did

86
00:07:12,961 --> 00:07:21,517
 exclaim many things unto the Lord; such as: Great

87
00:07:21,517 --> 00:07:30,073
 and marvelous are thy works, O Lord God Almighty!

88
00:07:30,073 --> 00:07:38,629
 Thy throne is high in the heavens, and thy power,

89
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:47,185
 and goodness, and mercy are over all the

90
00:07:47,185 --> 00:07:55,741
 inhabitants of the earth; and, because thou art merciful,

91
00:07:55,741 --> 00:08:04,297
 thou wilt not suffer those who come unto thee that

92
00:08:04,297 --> 00:08:12,853
 they shall perish

93
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:19,692
15 And after this manner was the language of my

94
00:08:19,692 --> 00:08:26,692
 father in the praising of his God; for his soul did

95
00:08:26,692 --> 00:08:33,692
 rejoice, and his whole heart was filled, because

96
00:08:33,692 --> 00:08:40,692
 of the things which he had seen, yea, which the

97
00:08:40,692 --> 00:08:47,692
 Lord had shown unto him

98
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:54,693
16 And now I, Nephi, do not make a full account of

99
00:08:54,693 --> 00:09:02,193
 the things which my father hath written, for he

100
00:09:02,193 --> 00:09:09,693
 hath written many things which he saw in visions

101
00:09:09,693 --> 00:09:17,193
 and in dreams; and he also hath written many things

102
00:09:17,193 --> 00:09:24,693
 which he prophesied and spake unto his children,

103
00:09:24,693 --> 00:09:32,193
 of which I shall not make a full account

104
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:37,272
17 But I shall make an account of my proceedings

105
00:09:37,272 --> 00:09:42,439
 in my days. Behold, I make an abridgment of the

106
00:09:42,439 --> 00:09:47,606
 record of my father, upon plates which I have made

107
00:09:47,606 --> 00:09:52,773
 with mine own hands; wherefore, after I have

108
00:09:52,773 --> 00:09:57,94
 abridged the record of my father then will I make an

109
00:09:57,94 --> 00:10:03,107
 account of mine own life

110
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:08,965
18 Therefore, I would that ye should know, that

111
00:10:08,965 --> 00:10:14,394
 after the Lord had shown so many marvelous things

112
00:10:14,394 --> 00:10:19,823
 unto my father, Lehi, yea, concerning the

113
00:10:19,823 --> 00:10:25,252
 destruction of Jerusalem, behold he went forth among the

114
00:10:25,252 --> 00:10:30,681
 people, and began to prophesy and to declare unto

115
00:10:30,681 --> 00:10:36,11
 them concerning the things which he had both seen and

116
00:10:36,11 --> 00:10:41,539
 heard

117
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:47,916
19 And it came to pass that the Jews did mock him

118
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:54,291
 because of the things which he testified of them;

119
00:10:54,291 --> 00:11:00,666
 for he truly testified of their wickedness and

120
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:07,041
 their abominations; and he testified that the things

121
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:13,416
 which he saw and heard, and also the things which

122
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:19,791
 he read in the book, manifested plainly of the

123
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:26,166
 coming of a Messiah, and also the redemption of the

124
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:32,541
 world

125
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:36,902
20 And when the Jews heard these things they were

126
00:11:36,902 --> 00:11:41,346
 angry with him; yea, even as with the prophets of

127
00:11:41,346 --> 00:11:45,79
 old, whom they had cast out, and stoned, and

128
00:11:45,79 --> 00:11:50,234
 slain; and they also sought his life, that they might

129
00:11:50,234 --> 00:11:54,678
 take it away. But behold, I, Nephi, will show unto

130
00:11:54,678 --> 00:11:59,122
 you that the tender mercies of the Lord are over

131
00:11:59,122 --> 00:12:03,566
 all those whom he hath chosen, because of their

132
00:12:03,566 --> 00:12:08,01
 faith, to make them mighty even unto the power of

133
00:12:08,01 --> 00:12:12,454
 deliverance.
