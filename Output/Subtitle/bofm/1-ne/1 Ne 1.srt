00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:02,0
The First Book of NephiHis Reign and MinistryAn account of 

2
00:00:02,0 --> 00:00:04,0
Lehi and his wife Sariah, and his four sons, being 

3
00:00:04,0 --> 00:00:06,0
called, (beginning at the eldest) Laman, Lemuel, Sam, and Nephi. 

4
00:00:06,0 --> 00:00:08,0
The Lord warns Lehi to depart out of the land 

5
00:00:08,0 --> 00:00:10,0
of Jerusalem, because he prophesieth unto the people concerning their 

6
00:00:10,0 --> 00:00:12,0
iniquity and they seek to destroy his life. He taketh 

7
00:00:12,0 --> 00:00:14,0
three days’ journey into the wilderness with his family. Nephi 

8
00:00:14,0 --> 00:00:16,0
taketh his brethren and returneth to the land of Jerusalem 

9
00:00:16,0 --> 00:00:18,0
after the record of the Jews. The account of their 

10
00:00:18,0 --> 00:00:20,0
sufferings. They take the daughters of Ishmael to wife. They 

11
00:00:20,0 --> 00:00:22,0
take their families and depart into the wilderness. Their sufferings 

12
00:00:22,0 --> 00:00:24,0
and afflictions in the wilderness. The course of their travels. 

13
00:00:24,0 --> 00:00:26,0
They come to the large waters. Nephi’s brethren rebel against 

14
00:00:26,0 --> 00:00:28,0
him. He confoundeth them, and buildeth a ship. They call 

15
00:00:28,0 --> 00:00:30,0
the name of the place Bountiful. They cross the large 

16
00:00:30,0 --> 00:00:32,0
waters into the promised land, and so forth. This is 

17
00:00:32,0 --> 00:00:34,0
according to the account of Nephi; or in other words, 

18
00:00:34,0 --> 00:00:36,0
I, Nephi, wrote this record.Chapter 1 Nephi begins the record 

19
00:00:36,0 --> 00:00:38,0
of his people—Lehi sees in vision a pillar of fire 

20
00:00:38,0 --> 00:00:40,0
and reads from a book of prophecy—He praises God, foretells 

21
00:00:40,0 --> 00:00:42,0
the coming of the Messiah, and prophesies the destruction of 

22
00:00:42,0 --> 00:00:44,0
Jerusalem—He is persecuted by the Jews. About 600 B.C.  

23
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:53,192
1 I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore 

24
00:00:53,192 --> 00:01:01,906
I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my 

25
00:01:01,906 --> 00:01:10,621
father; and having seen many afflictions in the course of 

26
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:19,335
my days, nevertheless, having been highly favored of the Lord 

27
00:01:19,335 --> 00:01:28,049
in all my days; yea, having had a great knowledge 

28
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:36,763
of the goodness and the mysteries of God, therefore I 

29
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:45,478
make a record of my proceedings in my days. 

30
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:51,005
2 Yea, I make a record in the language of 

31
00:01:51,005 --> 00:01:56,672
my father, which consists of the learning of the Jews 

32
00:01:56,672 --> 00:02:02,339
and the language of the Egyptians. 

33
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:10,189
3 And I know that the record which I make 

34
00:02:10,189 --> 00:02:17,523
is true; and I make it with mine own hand; 

35
00:02:17,523 --> 00:02:24,856
and I make it according to my knowledge. 

36
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:32,344
4 For it came to pass in the commencement of 

37
00:02:32,344 --> 00:02:40,344
the first year of the reign of Zedekiah, king of 

38
00:02:40,344 --> 00:02:48,344
Judah, (my father, Lehi, having dwelt at Jerusalem in all 

39
00:02:48,344 --> 00:02:56,344
his days); and in that same year there came many 

40
00:02:56,344 --> 00:03:04,344
prophets, prophesying unto the people that they must repent, or 

41
00:03:04,344 --> 00:03:12,344
the great city Jerusalem must be destroyed. 

42
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:20,525
5 Wherefore it came to pass that my father, Lehi, 

43
00:03:20,525 --> 00:03:28,859
as he went forth prayed unto the Lord, yea, even 

44
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:37,192
with all his heart, in behalf of his people. 

45
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:44,184
6 And it came to pass as he prayed unto 

46
00:03:44,184 --> 00:03:51,184
the Lord, there came a pillar of fire and dwelt 

47
00:03:51,184 --> 00:03:58,184
upon a rock before him; and he saw and heard 

48
00:03:58,184 --> 00:04:05,184
much; and because of the things which he saw and 

49
00:04:05,184 --> 00:04:12,184
heard he did quake and tremble exceedingly. 

50
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:17,619
7 And it came to pass that he returned to 

51
00:04:17,619 --> 00:04:23,119
his own house at Jerusalem; and he cast himself upon 

52
00:04:23,119 --> 00:04:28,619
his bed, being overcome with the Spirit and the things 

53
00:04:28,619 --> 00:04:34,119
which he had seen. 

54
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:41,874
8 And being thus overcome with the Spirit, he was 

55
00:04:41,874 --> 00:04:49,674
carried away in a vision, even that he saw the 

56
00:04:49,674 --> 00:04:57,474
heavens open, and he thought he saw God sitting upon 

57
00:04:57,474 --> 00:05:05,274
his throne, surrounded with numberless concourses of angels in the 

58
00:05:05,274 --> 00:05:13,074
attitude of singing and praising their God. 

59
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:18,947
9 And it came to pass that he saw One 

60
00:05:18,947 --> 00:05:23,947
descending out of the midst of heaven, and he beheld 

61
00:05:23,947 --> 00:05:28,947
that his luster was above that of the sun at 

62
00:05:28,947 --> 00:05:33,947
noon-day. 

63
00:05:33,9 --> 00:05:40,567
10 And he also saw twelve others following him, and 

64
00:05:40,567 --> 00:05:47,234
their brightness did exceed that of the stars in the 

65
00:05:47,234 --> 00:05:53,9
firmament. 

66
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:59,103
11 And they came down and went forth upon the 

67
00:05:59,103 --> 00:06:04,353
face of the earth; and the first came and stood 

68
00:06:04,353 --> 00:06:09,603
before my father, and gave unto him a book, and 

69
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:14,853
bade him that he should read. 

70
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:18,907
12 And it came to pass that as he read, 

71
00:06:18,907 --> 00:06:23,407
he was filled with the Spirit of the Lord. 

72
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:25,584
13 And he read, saying: Wo, wo, unto Jerusalem, for 

73
00:06:25,584 --> 00:06:27,184
I have seen thine abominations! Yea, and many things did 

74
00:06:27,184 --> 00:06:28,784
my father read concerning Jerusalem—that it should be destroyed, and 

75
00:06:28,784 --> 00:06:30,384
the inhabitants thereof; many should perish by the sword, and 

76
00:06:30,384 --> 00:06:31,984
many should be carried away captive into Babylon. 

77
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,958
14 And it came to pass that when my father 

78
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:35,958
had read and seen many great and marvelous things, he 

79
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,958
did exclaim many things unto the Lord; such as: Great 

80
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,958
and marvelous are thy works, O Lord God Almighty! Thy 

81
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,958
throne is high in the heavens, and thy power, and 

82
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,958
goodness, and mercy are over all the inhabitants of the 

83
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,958
earth; and, because thou art merciful, thou wilt not suffer 

84
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,958
those who come unto thee that they shall perish! 

85
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,508
15 And after this manner was the language of my 

86
00:06:49,508 --> 00:06:51,108
father in the praising of his God; for his soul 

87
00:06:51,108 --> 00:06:52,708
did rejoice, and his whole heart was filled, because of 

88
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,308
the things which he had seen, yea, which the Lord 

89
00:06:54,308 --> 00:06:55,908
had shown unto him. 

90
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:57,215
16 And now I, Nephi, do not make a full 

91
00:06:57,215 --> 00:06:58,549
account of the things which my father hath written, for 

92
00:06:58,549 --> 00:06:59,882
he hath written many things which he saw in visions 

93
00:06:59,882 --> 00:07:01,215
and in dreams; and he also hath written many things 

94
00:07:01,215 --> 00:07:02,549
which he prophesied and spake unto his children, of which 

95
00:07:02,549 --> 00:07:03,882
I shall not make a full account. 

96
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:05,19
17 But I shall make an account of my proceedings 

97
00:07:05,19 --> 00:07:06,523
in my days. Behold, I make an abridgment of the 

98
00:07:06,523 --> 00:07:07,857
record of my father, upon plates which I have made 

99
00:07:07,857 --> 00:07:09,19
with mine own hands; wherefore, after I have abridged the 

100
00:07:09,19 --> 00:07:10,523
record of my father then will I make an account 

101
00:07:10,523 --> 00:07:11,857
of mine own life. 

102
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:13,165
18 Therefore, I would that ye should know, that after 

103
00:07:13,165 --> 00:07:14,498
the Lord had shown so many marvelous things unto my 

104
00:07:14,498 --> 00:07:15,831
father, Lehi, yea, concerning the destruction of Jerusalem, behold he 

105
00:07:15,831 --> 00:07:17,165
went forth among the people, and began to prophesy and 

106
00:07:17,165 --> 00:07:18,498
to declare unto them concerning the things which he had 

107
00:07:18,498 --> 00:07:19,831
both seen and heard. 

108
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:20,949
19 And it came to pass that the Jews did 

109
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:22,092
mock him because of the things which he testified of 

110
00:07:22,092 --> 00:07:23,235
them; for he truly testified of their wickedness and their 

111
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:24,377
abominations; and he testified that the things which he saw 

112
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:25,52
and heard, and also the things which he read in 

113
00:07:25,52 --> 00:07:26,663
the book, manifested plainly of the coming of a Messiah, 

114
00:07:26,663 --> 00:07:27,806
and also the redemption of the world. 

115
00:07:27,781 --> 00:08:06,531
20 And when the Jews heard these things they were 

116
00:08:06,531 --> 00:08:45,281
angry with him; yea, even as with the prophets of 

117
00:08:45,281 --> 00:09:24,031
old, whom they had cast out, and stoned, and slain; 

118
00:09:24,031 --> 00:10:02,781
and they also sought his life, that they might take 

119
00:10:02,781 --> 00:10:41,531
it away. But behold, I, Nephi, will show unto you 

120
00:10:41,531 --> 00:11:20,281
that the tender mercies of the Lord are over all 

121
00:11:20,281 --> 00:11:59,031
those whom he hath chosen, because of their faith, to 

122
00:11:59,031 --> 00:12:37,781
make them mighty even unto the power of deliverance.
