1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,769
The First Book of NephiHis Reign and MinistryAn

2
00:00:00,769 --> 00:00:01,538
account of Lehi and his wife Sariah, and his four

3
00:00:01,538 --> 00:00:02,307
sons, being called, (beginning at the eldest)

4
00:00:02,307 --> 00:00:03,076
Laman, Lemuel, Sam, and Nephi. The Lord warns Lehi

5
00:00:03,076 --> 00:00:03,845
to depart out of the land of Jerusalem, because he

6
00:00:03,845 --> 00:00:04,614
prophesieth unto the people concerning their

7
00:00:04,614 --> 00:00:05,383
iniquity and they seek to destroy his life. He

8
00:00:05,383 --> 00:00:06,152
taketh three days’ journey into the wilderness with

9
00:00:06,152 --> 00:00:06,921
his family. Nephi taketh his brethren and returneth

10
00:00:06,921 --> 00:00:07,69
to the land of Jerusalem after the record of the

11
00:00:07,69 --> 00:00:08,459
Jews. The account of their sufferings. They take

12
00:00:08,459 --> 00:00:09,228
the daughters of Ishmael to wife. They take

13
00:00:09,228 --> 00:00:09,997
their families and depart into the wilderness. Their

14
00:00:09,997 --> 00:00:10,766
sufferings and afflictions in the wilderness. The

15
00:00:10,766 --> 00:00:11,535
course of their travels. They come to the large

16
00:00:11,535 --> 00:00:12,304
waters. Nephi’s brethren rebel against him. He

17
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:13,073
confoundeth them, and buildeth a ship. They call

18
00:00:13,073 --> 00:00:13,842
the name of the place Bountiful. They cross the

19
00:00:13,842 --> 00:00:14,611
large waters into the promised land, and so forth.

20
00:00:14,611 --> 00:00:15,38
This is according to the account of Nephi; or in

21
00:00:15,38 --> 00:00:16,149
other words, I, Nephi, wrote this record.Chapter 1

22
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:16,918
Nephi begins the record of his people—Lehi sees

23
00:00:16,918 --> 00:00:17,687
in vision a pillar of fire and reads from a book

24
00:00:17,687 --> 00:00:18,456
of prophecy—He praises God, foretells the coming

25
00:00:18,456 --> 00:00:19,225
of the Messiah, and prophesies the destruction of

26
00:00:19,225 --> 00:00:20,42
Jerusalem—He is persecuted by the Jews. About 600 B.C. 

27
00:00:20,42 --> 00:00:21,42
1 I, Nephi, having been born of goodly

28
00:00:21,42 --> 00:00:22,42
parents, therefore I was taught somewhat in all the

29
00:00:22,42 --> 00:00:23,42
learning of my father; and having seen many

30
00:00:23,42 --> 00:00:24,42
afflictions in the course of my days,

31
00:00:24,42 --> 00:00:25,42
nevertheless, having been highly favored of the Lord in

32
00:00:25,42 --> 00:00:26,42
all my days; yea, having had a great knowledge

33
00:00:26,42 --> 00:00:27,42
of the goodness and the mysteries of God,

34
00:00:27,42 --> 00:00:28,495
therefore I make a record of my proceedings in my days.

35
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:33,162
2 Yea, I make a record in the language of

36
00:00:33,162 --> 00:00:37,829
my father, which consists of the learning of

37
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:42,442
the Jews and the language of the Egyptians.

38
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:45,109
3 And I know that the record which I make

39
00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:47,776
is true; and I make it with mine own

40
00:00:47,776 --> 00:00:50,517
hand; and I make it according to my knowledge.

41
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:51,517
4 For it came to pass in the

42
00:00:51,517 --> 00:00:52,517
commencement of the first year of the reign of

43
00:00:52,517 --> 00:00:53,517
Zedekiah, king of Judah, (my father,

44
00:00:53,517 --> 00:00:54,517
Lehi, having dwelt at Jerusalem in all

45
00:00:54,517 --> 00:00:55,517
his days); and in that same year there

46
00:00:55,517 --> 00:00:56,517
came many prophets, prophesying unto

47
00:00:56,517 --> 00:00:57,517
the people that they must repent, or

48
00:00:57,517 --> 00:00:58,592
the great city Jerusalem must be destroyed.

49
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:03,842
5 Wherefore it came to pass that my

50
00:01:03,842 --> 00:01:09,092
father, Lehi, as he went forth

51
00:01:09,092 --> 00:01:14,342
prayed unto the Lord, yea, even with

52
00:01:14,342 --> 00:01:19,046
all his heart, in behalf of his people.

53
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:20,76
6 And it came to pass as he

54
00:01:20,76 --> 00:01:22,474
prayed unto the Lord, there came a

55
00:01:22,474 --> 00:01:24,188
pillar of fire and dwelt upon a

56
00:01:24,188 --> 00:01:25,902
rock before him; and he saw and

57
00:01:25,902 --> 00:01:27,616
heard much; and because of the

58
00:01:27,616 --> 00:01:29,33
things which he saw and heard he

59
00:01:29,33 --> 00:01:31,992
did quake and tremble exceedingly.

60
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:33,492
7 And it came to pass that

61
00:01:33,492 --> 00:01:34,992
he returned to his own house

62
00:01:34,992 --> 00:01:36,492
at Jerusalem; and he cast

63
00:01:36,492 --> 00:01:37,992
himself upon his bed, being

64
00:01:37,992 --> 00:01:39,492
overcome with the Spirit and

65
00:01:39,492 --> 00:01:40,067
the things which he had seen.

66
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:40,867
8 And being thus overcome

67
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:41,667
with the Spirit, he was

68
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:42,467
carried away in a vision,

69
00:01:42,467 --> 00:01:43,267
even that he saw the heavens

70
00:01:43,267 --> 00:01:44,067
open, and he thought he

71
00:01:44,067 --> 00:01:44,867
saw God sitting upon his

72
00:01:44,867 --> 00:01:45,667
throne, surrounded with

73
00:01:45,667 --> 00:01:46,467
numberless concourses of

74
00:01:46,467 --> 00:01:47,267
angels in the attitude of

75
00:01:47,267 --> 00:01:48,141
singing and praising their God.

76
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:51,308
9 And it came to pass

77
00:01:51,308 --> 00:01:54,475
that he saw One descending

78
00:01:54,475 --> 00:01:57,642
out of the midst of

79
00:01:57,642 --> 00:02:00,809
heaven, and he beheld that

80
00:02:00,809 --> 00:02:03,976
his luster was above

81
00:02:03,976 --> 00:02:07,027
that of the sun at noon-day.

82
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:08,827
10 And he also saw

83
00:02:08,827 --> 00:02:10,627
twelve others following

84
00:02:10,627 --> 00:02:12,427
him, and their brightness

85
00:02:12,427 --> 00:02:14,227
did exceed that of the

86
00:02:14,227 --> 00:02:16,503
stars in the firmament.

87
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:17,503
11 And they came down

88
00:02:17,503 --> 00:02:18,503
and went forth upon

89
00:02:18,503 --> 00:02:19,503
the face of the

90
00:02:19,503 --> 00:02:20,503
earth; and the first came

91
00:02:20,503 --> 00:02:21,503
and stood before my

92
00:02:21,503 --> 00:02:22,503
father, and gave unto

93
00:02:22,503 --> 00:02:23,503
him a book, and bade

94
00:02:23,503 --> 00:02:24,578
him that he should read.

95
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:26,828
12 And it came to

96
00:02:26,828 --> 00:02:29,078
pass that as he read,

97
00:02:29,078 --> 00:02:31,328
he was filled with

98
00:02:31,328 --> 00:02:33,587
the Spirit of the Lord.

99
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:35,587
13 And he read,

100
00:02:35,587 --> 00:02:37,587
saying: Wo, wo, unto

101
00:02:37,587 --> 00:02:39,587
Jerusalem, for I

102
00:02:39,587 --> 00:02:41,587
have seen thine

103
00:02:41,587 --> 00:02:43,587
abominations! Yea, and

104
00:02:43,587 --> 00:02:45,587
many things did my

105
00:02:45,587 --> 00:02:47,587
father read

106
00:02:47,587 --> 00:02:49,587
concerning Jerusalem—that it

107
00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:51,587
should be

108
00:02:51,587 --> 00:02:53,587
destroyed, and the

109
00:02:53,587 --> 00:02:55,587
inhabitants thereof; many

110
00:02:55,587 --> 00:02:57,587
should perish by the

111
00:02:57,587 --> 00:02:59,587
sword, and many

112
00:02:59,587 --> 00:03:01,587
should be carried

113
00:03:01,587 --> 00:03:03,917
away captive into Babylon.

114
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:04,265
14 And it came to

115
00:03:04,265 --> 00:03:04,613
pass that when my

116
00:03:04,613 --> 00:03:04,961
father had read

117
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:05,309
and seen many great

118
00:03:05,309 --> 00:03:05,657
and marvelous

119
00:03:05,657 --> 00:03:06,005
things, he did exclaim

120
00:03:06,005 --> 00:03:06,353
many things unto

121
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:06,701
the Lord; such as:

122
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:07,049
Great and

123
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:07,397
marvelous are thy works,

124
00:03:07,397 --> 00:03:07,745
O Lord God

125
00:03:07,745 --> 00:03:08,093
Almighty! Thy throne is

126
00:03:08,093 --> 00:03:08,441
high in the

127
00:03:08,441 --> 00:03:08,789
heavens, and thy power,

128
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:09,137
and goodness, and

129
00:03:09,137 --> 00:03:09,485
mercy are over all

130
00:03:09,485 --> 00:03:09,833
the inhabitants of

131
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:10,181
the earth; and,

132
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:10,529
because thou art

133
00:03:10,529 --> 00:03:10,877
merciful, thou wilt

134
00:03:10,877 --> 00:03:11,225
not suffer those

135
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:11,573
who come unto thee

136
00:03:11,573 --> 00:03:11,992
that they shall perish!

137
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:12,915
15 And after this

138
00:03:12,915 --> 00:03:13,838
manner was the

139
00:03:13,838 --> 00:03:14,761
language of my

140
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:15,684
father in the

141
00:03:15,684 --> 00:03:16,607
praising of his God;

142
00:03:16,607 --> 00:03:17,53
for his soul did

143
00:03:17,53 --> 00:03:18,453
rejoice, and his

144
00:03:18,453 --> 00:03:19,376
whole heart was

145
00:03:19,376 --> 00:03:20,299
filled, because of

146
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:21,222
the things which

147
00:03:21,222 --> 00:03:22,145
he had seen, yea,

148
00:03:22,145 --> 00:03:23,068
which the Lord

149
00:03:23,068 --> 00:03:23,403
had shown unto him.

150
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:23,903
16 And now I,

151
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:24,403
Nephi, do not make

152
00:03:24,403 --> 00:03:24,903
a full account

153
00:03:24,903 --> 00:03:25,403
of the things

154
00:03:25,403 --> 00:03:25,903
which my father

155
00:03:25,903 --> 00:03:26,403
hath written, for

156
00:03:26,403 --> 00:03:26,903
he hath written

157
00:03:26,903 --> 00:03:27,403
many things

158
00:03:27,403 --> 00:03:27,903
which he saw in

159
00:03:27,903 --> 00:03:28,403
visions and in

160
00:03:28,403 --> 00:03:28,903
dreams; and he also

161
00:03:28,903 --> 00:03:29,403
hath written many

162
00:03:29,403 --> 00:03:29,903
things which he

163
00:03:29,903 --> 00:03:30,403
prophesied and

164
00:03:30,403 --> 00:03:30,903
spake unto his

165
00:03:30,903 --> 00:03:31,403
children, of

166
00:03:31,403 --> 00:03:31,903
which I shall not

167
00:03:31,903 --> 00:03:32,412
make a full account.

168
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:33,118
17 But I shall

169
00:03:33,118 --> 00:03:33,824
make an account

170
00:03:33,824 --> 00:03:34,53
of my

171
00:03:34,53 --> 00:03:35,236
proceedings in my days.

172
00:03:35,236 --> 00:03:35,942
Behold, I make

173
00:03:35,942 --> 00:03:36,648
an abridgment

174
00:03:36,648 --> 00:03:37,354
of the record

175
00:03:37,354 --> 00:03:38,06
of my father,

176
00:03:38,06 --> 00:03:38,766
upon plates which

177
00:03:38,766 --> 00:03:39,472
I have made

178
00:03:39,472 --> 00:03:40,178
with mine own

179
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:40,884
hands; wherefore,

180
00:03:40,884 --> 00:03:41,59
after I have

181
00:03:41,59 --> 00:03:42,296
abridged the

182
00:03:42,296 --> 00:03:43,002
record of my father

183
00:03:43,002 --> 00:03:43,708
then will I

184
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:44,424
make an account of mine own life.

185
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:45,614
18 Therefore,

186
00:03:45,614 --> 00:03:46,804
I would that

187
00:03:46,804 --> 00:03:47,994
ye should know,

188
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,184
that after

189
00:03:49,184 --> 00:03:50,374
the Lord had

190
00:03:50,374 --> 00:03:51,564
shown so many

191
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,754
marvelous things

192
00:03:52,754 --> 00:03:53,944
unto my

193
00:03:53,944 --> 00:03:55,134
father, Lehi, yea,

194
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:56,324
concerning the

195
00:03:56,324 --> 00:03:57,514
destruction of

196
00:03:57,514 --> 00:03:58,704
Jerusalem,

197
00:03:58,704 --> 00:03:59,894
behold he went

198
00:03:59,894 --> 00:04:01,084
forth among the

199
00:04:01,084 --> 00:04:02,274
people, and

200
00:04:02,274 --> 00:04:03,464
began to

201
00:04:03,464 --> 00:04:04,654
prophesy and to

202
00:04:04,654 --> 00:04:05,844
declare unto them

203
00:04:05,844 --> 00:04:07,034
concerning the

204
00:04:07,034 --> 00:04:08,224
things which

205
00:04:08,224 --> 00:04:09,85
he had both seen and heard.

206
00:04:09,85 --> 00:04:10,773
19 And it

207
00:04:10,773 --> 00:04:11,696
came to pass

208
00:04:11,696 --> 00:04:12,619
that the Jews

209
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:13,542
did mock him

210
00:04:13,542 --> 00:04:14,465
because of the

211
00:04:14,465 --> 00:04:15,388
things which

212
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:16,311
he testified

213
00:04:16,311 --> 00:04:17,234
of them; for

214
00:04:17,234 --> 00:04:18,157
he truly

215
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:19,08
testified of

216
00:04:19,08 --> 00:04:20,003
their wickedness

217
00:04:20,003 --> 00:04:20,926
and their

218
00:04:20,926 --> 00:04:21,849
abominations;

219
00:04:21,849 --> 00:04:22,772
and he

220
00:04:22,772 --> 00:04:23,695
testified that the

221
00:04:23,695 --> 00:04:24,618
things which he

222
00:04:24,618 --> 00:04:25,541
saw and

223
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:26,464
heard, and also

224
00:04:26,464 --> 00:04:27,387
the things

225
00:04:27,387 --> 00:04:28,31
which he read in

226
00:04:28,31 --> 00:04:29,233
the book,

227
00:04:29,233 --> 00:04:30,156
manifested

228
00:04:30,156 --> 00:04:31,079
plainly of the

229
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:32,002
coming of a

230
00:04:32,002 --> 00:04:32,925
Messiah, and

231
00:04:32,925 --> 00:04:33,874
also the redemption of the world.

232
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:34,53
20 And when

233
00:04:34,53 --> 00:04:35,186
the Jews

234
00:04:35,186 --> 00:04:35,842
heard these

235
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:36,498
things they

236
00:04:36,498 --> 00:04:37,154
were angry with

237
00:04:37,154 --> 00:04:37,81
him; yea,

238
00:04:37,81 --> 00:04:38,466
even as with

239
00:04:38,466 --> 00:04:39,122
the prophets

240
00:04:39,122 --> 00:04:39,778
of old,

241
00:04:39,778 --> 00:04:40,434
whom they had

242
00:04:40,434 --> 00:04:41,09
cast out, and

243
00:04:41,09 --> 00:04:41,746
stoned, and

244
00:04:41,746 --> 00:04:42,402
slain; and

245
00:04:42,402 --> 00:04:43,058
they also

246
00:04:43,058 --> 00:04:43,714
sought his

247
00:04:43,714 --> 00:04:44,37
life, that they

248
00:04:44,37 --> 00:04:45,026
might take

249
00:04:45,026 --> 00:04:45,682
it away. But

250
00:04:45,682 --> 00:04:46,338
behold, I,

251
00:04:46,338 --> 00:04:46,994
Nephi, will

252
00:04:46,994 --> 00:04:47,65
show unto

253
00:04:47,65 --> 00:04:48,306
you that the

254
00:04:48,306 --> 00:04:48,962
tender

255
00:04:48,962 --> 00:04:49,618
mercies of the

256
00:04:49,618 --> 00:04:50,274
Lord are over

257
00:04:50,274 --> 00:04:50,93
all those

258
00:04:50,93 --> 00:04:51,586
whom he hath

259
00:04:51,586 --> 00:04:52,242
chosen,

260
00:04:52,242 --> 00:04:52,898
because of their

261
00:04:52,898 --> 00:04:53,554
faith, to

262
00:04:53,554 --> 00:04:54,21
make them

263
00:04:54,21 --> 00:04:54,294
mighty even unto the power of deliverance.
