00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
The First Book of NephiHis Reign and MinistryAn

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
account of Lehi and his wife Sariah, and his four

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
sons, being called, (beginning at the eldest)

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Laman, Lemuel, Sam, and Nephi. The Lord warns Lehi

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
to depart out of the land of Jerusalem, because he

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
prophesieth unto the people concerning their

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
iniquity and they seek to destroy his life. He

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
taketh three days’ journey into the wilderness with

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
his family. Nephi taketh his brethren and returneth

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
to the land of Jerusalem after the record of the

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Jews. The account of their sufferings. They take

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the daughters of Ishmael to wife. They take

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
their families and depart into the wilderness. Their

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
sufferings and afflictions in the wilderness. The

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
course of their travels. They come to the large

16
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
waters. Nephi’s brethren rebel against him. He

17
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
confoundeth them, and buildeth a ship. They call

18
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the name of the place Bountiful. They cross the

19
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
large waters into the promised land, and so forth.

20
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
This is according to the account of Nephi; or in

21
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
other words, I, Nephi, wrote this record.Chapter 1

22
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Nephi begins the record of his people—Lehi sees

23
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
in vision a pillar of fire and reads from a book

24
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of prophecy—He praises God, foretells the coming

25
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of the Messiah, and prophesies the destruction of

26
00:00:00,0 --> 00:03:31,
Jerusalem—He is persecuted by the Jews. About 600 B.C. 

27
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
1 I, Nephi, having been born of goodly

28
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
parents, therefore I was taught somewhat in all the

29
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
learning of my father; and having seen many

30
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
afflictions in the course of my days,

31
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
nevertheless, having been highly favored of the Lord in

32
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
all my days; yea, having had a great knowledge

33
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
of the goodness and the mysteries of God,

34
00:03:31,0 --> 00:11:15,
therefore I make a record of my proceedings in my days.

35
00:11:15,0 --> 00:11:15,0
2 Yea, I make a record in the language of

36
00:11:15,0 --> 00:11:15,0
my father, which consists of the learning of

37
00:11:15,0 --> 00:15:28,
the Jews and the language of the Egyptians.

38
00:15:28,0 --> 00:15:28,0
3 And I know that the record which I make

39
00:15:28,0 --> 00:15:28,0
is true; and I make it with mine own

40
00:15:28,0 --> 00:19:27,
hand; and I make it according to my knowledge.

41
00:19:27,0 --> 00:19:27,0
4 For it came to pass in the

42
00:19:27,0 --> 00:19:27,0
commencement of the first year of the reign of

43
00:19:27,0 --> 00:19:27,0
Zedekiah, king of Judah, (my father,

44
00:19:27,0 --> 00:19:27,0
Lehi, having dwelt at Jerusalem in all

45
00:19:27,0 --> 00:19:27,0
his days); and in that same year there

46
00:19:27,0 --> 00:19:27,0
came many prophets, prophesying unto

47
00:19:27,0 --> 00:19:27,0
the people that they must repent, or

48
00:19:27,0 --> 00:18:59,
the great city Jerusalem must be destroyed.

49
00:18:59,0 --> 00:18:59,0
5 Wherefore it came to pass that my

50
00:18:59,0 --> 00:18:59,0
father, Lehi, as he went forth

51
00:18:59,0 --> 00:18:59,0
prayed unto the Lord, yea, even with

52
00:18:59,0 --> 00:20:57,
all his heart, in behalf of his people.

53
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
6 And it came to pass as he

54
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
prayed unto the Lord, there came a

55
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
pillar of fire and dwelt upon a

56
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
rock before him; and he saw and

57
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
heard much; and because of the

58
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
things which he saw and heard he

59
00:20:57,0 --> 00:23:09,
did quake and tremble exceedingly.

60
00:23:09,0 --> 00:23:09,0
7 And it came to pass that

61
00:23:09,0 --> 00:23:09,0
he returned to his own house

62
00:23:09,0 --> 00:23:09,0
at Jerusalem; and he cast

63
00:23:09,0 --> 00:23:09,0
himself upon his bed, being

64
00:23:09,0 --> 00:23:09,0
overcome with the Spirit and

65
00:23:09,0 --> 00:22:41,
the things which he had seen.

66
00:22:41,0 --> 00:22:41,0
8 And being thus overcome

67
00:22:41,0 --> 00:22:41,0
with the Spirit, he was

68
00:22:41,0 --> 00:22:41,0
carried away in a vision,

69
00:22:41,0 --> 00:22:41,0
even that he saw the heavens

70
00:22:41,0 --> 00:22:41,0
open, and he thought he

71
00:22:41,0 --> 00:22:41,0
saw God sitting upon his

72
00:22:41,0 --> 00:22:41,0
throne, surrounded with

73
00:22:41,0 --> 00:22:41,0
numberless concourses of

74
00:22:41,0 --> 00:22:41,0
angels in the attitude of

75
00:22:41,0 --> 00:24:25,
singing and praising their God.

76
00:24:25,0 --> 00:24:25,0
9 And it came to pass

77
00:24:25,0 --> 00:24:25,0
that he saw One descending

78
00:24:25,0 --> 00:24:25,0
out of the midst of

79
00:24:25,0 --> 00:24:25,0
heaven, and he beheld that

80
00:24:25,0 --> 00:24:25,0
his luster was above

81
00:24:25,0 --> 00:26:53,
that of the sun at noon-day.

82
00:26:53,0 --> 00:26:53,0
10 And he also saw

83
00:26:53,0 --> 00:26:53,0
twelve others following

84
00:26:53,0 --> 00:26:53,0
him, and their brightness

85
00:26:53,0 --> 00:26:53,0
did exceed that of the

86
00:26:53,0 --> 00:28:23,
stars in the firmament.

87
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
11 And they came down

88
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
and went forth upon

89
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
the face of the

90
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
earth; and the first came

91
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
and stood before my

92
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
father, and gave unto

93
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
him a book, and bade

94
00:28:23,0 --> 00:30:35,
him that he should read.

95
00:30:35,0 --> 00:30:35,0
12 And it came to

96
00:30:35,0 --> 00:30:35,0
pass that as he read,

97
00:30:35,0 --> 00:30:35,0
he was filled with

98
00:30:35,0 --> 00:30:21,
the Spirit of the Lord.

99
00:30:21,0 --> 00:30:21,0
13 And he read,

100
00:30:21,0 --> 00:30:21,0
saying: Wo, wo, unto

101
00:30:21,0 --> 00:30:21,0
Jerusalem, for I

102
00:30:21,0 --> 00:30:21,0
have seen thine

103
00:30:21,0 --> 00:30:21,0
abominations! Yea, and

104
00:30:21,0 --> 00:30:21,0
many things did my

105
00:30:21,0 --> 00:30:21,0
father read

106
00:30:21,0 --> 00:30:21,0
concerning Jerusalem—that it

107
00:30:21,0 --> 00:30:21,0
should be

108
00:30:21,0 --> 00:30:21,0
destroyed, and the

109
00:30:21,0 --> 00:30:21,0
inhabitants thereof; many

110
00:30:21,0 --> 00:30:21,0
should perish by the

111
00:30:21,0 --> 00:30:21,0
sword, and many

112
00:30:21,0 --> 00:30:21,0
should be carried

113
00:30:21,0 --> 00:30:07,
away captive into Babylon.

114
00:30:07,0 --> 00:30:07,0
14 And it came to

115
00:30:07,0 --> 00:30:07,0
pass that when my

116
00:30:07,0 --> 00:30:07,0
father had read

117
00:30:07,0 --> 00:30:07,0
and seen many great

118
00:30:07,0 --> 00:30:07,0
and marvelous

119
00:30:07,0 --> 00:30:07,0
things, he did exclaim

120
00:30:07,0 --> 00:30:07,0
many things unto

121
00:30:07,0 --> 00:30:07,0
the Lord; such as:

122
00:30:07,0 --> 00:30:07,0
Great and

123
00:30:07,0 --> 00:30:07,0
marvelous are thy works,

124
00:30:07,0 --> 00:30:07,0
O Lord God

125
00:30:07,0 --> 00:30:07,0
Almighty! Thy throne is

126
00:30:07,0 --> 00:30:07,0
high in the

127
00:30:07,0 --> 00:30:07,0
heavens, and thy power,

128
00:30:07,0 --> 00:30:07,0
and goodness, and

129
00:30:07,0 --> 00:30:07,0
mercy are over all

130
00:30:07,0 --> 00:30:07,0
the inhabitants of

131
00:30:07,0 --> 00:30:07,0
the earth; and,

132
00:30:07,0 --> 00:30:07,0
because thou art

133
00:30:07,0 --> 00:30:07,0
merciful, thou wilt

134
00:30:07,0 --> 00:30:07,0
not suffer those

135
00:30:07,0 --> 00:30:07,0
who come unto thee

136
00:30:07,0 --> 00:41:50,
that they shall perish!

137
00:41:50,0 --> 00:41:50,0
15 And after this

138
00:41:50,0 --> 00:41:50,0
manner was the

139
00:41:50,0 --> 00:41:50,0
language of my

140
00:41:50,0 --> 00:41:50,0
father in the

141
00:41:50,0 --> 00:41:50,0
praising of his God;

142
00:41:50,0 --> 00:41:50,0
for his soul did

143
00:41:50,0 --> 00:41:50,0
rejoice, and his

144
00:41:50,0 --> 00:41:50,0
whole heart was

145
00:41:50,0 --> 00:41:50,0
filled, because of

146
00:41:50,0 --> 00:41:50,0
the things which

147
00:41:50,0 --> 00:41:50,0
he had seen, yea,

148
00:41:50,0 --> 00:41:50,0
which the Lord

149
00:41:50,0 --> 00:51:18,
had shown unto him.

150
00:51:18,0 --> 00:51:18,0
16 And now I,

151
00:51:18,0 --> 00:51:18,0
Nephi, do not make

152
00:51:18,0 --> 00:51:18,0
a full account

153
00:51:18,0 --> 00:51:18,0
of the things

154
00:51:18,0 --> 00:51:18,0
which my father

155
00:51:18,0 --> 00:51:18,0
hath written, for

156
00:51:18,0 --> 00:51:18,0
he hath written

157
00:51:18,0 --> 00:51:18,0
many things

158
00:51:18,0 --> 00:51:18,0
which he saw in

159
00:51:18,0 --> 00:51:18,0
visions and in

160
00:51:18,0 --> 00:51:18,0
dreams; and he also

161
00:51:18,0 --> 00:51:18,0
hath written many

162
00:51:18,0 --> 00:51:18,0
things which he

163
00:51:18,0 --> 00:51:18,0
prophesied and

164
00:51:18,0 --> 00:51:18,0
spake unto his

165
00:51:18,0 --> 00:51:18,0
children, of

166
00:51:18,0 --> 00:51:18,0
which I shall not

167
00:51:18,0 --> 01:00:13,
make a full account.

168
01:00:13,0 --> 01:00:13,0
17 But I shall

169
01:00:13,0 --> 01:00:13,0
make an account

170
01:00:13,0 --> 01:00:13,0
of my

171
01:00:13,0 --> 01:00:13,0
proceedings in my days.

172
01:00:13,0 --> 01:00:13,0
Behold, I make

173
01:00:13,0 --> 01:00:13,0
an abridgment

174
01:00:13,0 --> 01:00:13,0
of the record

175
01:00:13,0 --> 01:00:13,0
of my father,

176
01:00:13,0 --> 01:00:13,0
upon plates which

177
01:00:13,0 --> 01:00:13,0
I have made

178
01:00:13,0 --> 01:00:13,0
with mine own

179
01:00:13,0 --> 01:00:13,0
hands; wherefore,

180
01:00:13,0 --> 01:00:13,0
after I have

181
01:00:13,0 --> 01:00:13,0
abridged the

182
01:00:13,0 --> 01:00:13,0
record of my father

183
01:00:13,0 --> 01:00:13,0
then will I

184
01:00:13,0 --> 01:06:24,
make an account of mine own life.

185
01:06:24,0 --> 01:06:24,0
18 Therefore,

186
01:06:24,0 --> 01:06:24,0
I would that

187
01:06:24,0 --> 01:06:24,0
ye should know,

188
01:06:24,0 --> 01:06:24,0
that after

189
01:06:24,0 --> 01:06:24,0
the Lord had

190
01:06:24,0 --> 01:06:24,0
shown so many

191
01:06:24,0 --> 01:06:24,0
marvelous things

192
01:06:24,0 --> 01:06:24,0
unto my

193
01:06:24,0 --> 01:06:24,0
father, Lehi, yea,

194
01:06:24,0 --> 01:06:24,0
concerning the

195
01:06:24,0 --> 01:06:24,0
destruction of

196
01:06:24,0 --> 01:06:24,0
Jerusalem,

197
01:06:24,0 --> 01:06:24,0
behold he went

198
01:06:24,0 --> 01:06:24,0
forth among the

199
01:06:24,0 --> 01:06:24,0
people, and

200
01:06:24,0 --> 01:06:24,0
began to

201
01:06:24,0 --> 01:06:24,0
prophesy and to

202
01:06:24,0 --> 01:06:24,0
declare unto them

203
01:06:24,0 --> 01:06:24,0
concerning the

204
01:06:24,0 --> 01:06:24,0
things which

205
01:06:24,0 --> 01:11:35,
he had both seen and heard.

206
01:11:35,0 --> 01:11:35,0
19 And it

207
01:11:35,0 --> 01:11:35,0
came to pass

208
01:11:35,0 --> 01:11:35,0
that the Jews

209
01:11:35,0 --> 01:11:35,0
did mock him

210
01:11:35,0 --> 01:11:35,0
because of the

211
01:11:35,0 --> 01:11:35,0
things which

212
01:11:35,0 --> 01:11:35,0
he testified

213
01:11:35,0 --> 01:11:35,0
of them; for

214
01:11:35,0 --> 01:11:35,0
he truly

215
01:11:35,0 --> 01:11:35,0
testified of

216
01:11:35,0 --> 01:11:35,0
their wickedness

217
01:11:35,0 --> 01:11:35,0
and their

218
01:11:35,0 --> 01:11:35,0
abominations;

219
01:11:35,0 --> 01:11:35,0
and he

220
01:11:35,0 --> 01:11:35,0
testified that the

221
01:11:35,0 --> 01:11:35,0
things which he

222
01:11:35,0 --> 01:11:35,0
saw and

223
01:11:35,0 --> 01:11:35,0
heard, and also

224
01:11:35,0 --> 01:11:35,0
the things

225
01:11:35,0 --> 01:11:35,0
which he read in

226
01:11:35,0 --> 01:11:35,0
the book,

227
01:11:35,0 --> 01:11:35,0
manifested

228
01:11:35,0 --> 01:11:35,0
plainly of the

229
01:11:35,0 --> 01:11:35,0
coming of a

230
01:11:35,0 --> 01:11:35,0
Messiah, and

231
01:11:35,0 --> 01:15:05,
also the redemption of the world.

232
01:15:05,0 --> 01:15:05,0
20 And when

233
01:15:05,0 --> 01:15:05,0
the Jews

234
01:15:05,0 --> 01:15:05,0
heard these

235
01:15:05,0 --> 01:15:05,0
things they

236
01:15:05,0 --> 01:15:05,0
were angry with

237
01:15:05,0 --> 01:15:05,0
him; yea,

238
01:15:05,0 --> 01:15:05,0
even as with

239
01:15:05,0 --> 01:15:05,0
the prophets

240
01:15:05,0 --> 01:15:05,0
of old,

241
01:15:05,0 --> 01:15:05,0
whom they had

242
01:15:05,0 --> 01:15:05,0
cast out, and

243
01:15:05,0 --> 01:15:05,0
stoned, and

244
01:15:05,0 --> 01:15:05,0
slain; and

245
01:15:05,0 --> 01:15:05,0
they also

246
01:15:05,0 --> 01:15:05,0
sought his

247
01:15:05,0 --> 01:15:05,0
life, that they

248
01:15:05,0 --> 01:15:05,0
might take

249
01:15:05,0 --> 01:15:05,0
it away. But

250
01:15:05,0 --> 01:15:05,0
behold, I,

251
01:15:05,0 --> 01:15:05,0
Nephi, will

252
01:15:05,0 --> 01:15:05,0
show unto

253
01:15:05,0 --> 01:15:05,0
you that the

254
01:15:05,0 --> 01:15:05,0
tender

255
01:15:05,0 --> 01:15:05,0
mercies of the

256
01:15:05,0 --> 01:15:05,0
Lord are over

257
01:15:05,0 --> 01:15:05,0
all those

258
01:15:05,0 --> 01:15:05,0
whom he hath

259
01:15:05,0 --> 01:15:05,0
chosen,

260
01:15:05,0 --> 01:15:05,0
because of their

261
01:15:05,0 --> 01:15:05,0
faith, to

262
01:15:05,0 --> 01:15:05,0
make them

263
01:15:05,0 --> 01:14:37,
mighty even unto the power of deliverance.
