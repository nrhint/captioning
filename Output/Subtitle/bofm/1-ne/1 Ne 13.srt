1
00:00:00,4 --> 00:00:13,971
Chapter 13 Nephi sees in vision the church of the

2
00:00:13,971 --> 00:00:27,542
 devil set up among the Gentiles, the discovery and

3
00:00:27,542 --> 00:00:41,113
 colonizing of America, the loss of many plain and

4
00:00:41,113 --> 00:00:54,684
 precious parts of the Bible, the resultant state

5
00:00:54,684 --> 00:01:08,255
 of gentile apostasy, the restoration of the

6
00:01:08,255 --> 00:01:21,826
 gospel, the coming forth of latter-day scripture, and

7
00:01:21,826 --> 00:01:35,397
 the building up of Zion. About 600–592 B.C.

8
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:36,696
1 And it came to pass that the angel spake unto

9
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:37,696
 me, saying: Look! And I looked and beheld many

10
00:01:37,696 --> 00:01:38,696
 nations and kingdoms

11
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:44,298
2 And the angel said unto me: What beholdest thou?

12
00:01:44,298 --> 00:01:50,298
 And I said: I behold many nations and kingdoms

13
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:57,811
3 And he said unto me: These are the nations and

14
00:01:57,811 --> 00:02:04,811
 kingdoms of the Gentiles

15
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:10,791
4 And it came to pass that I saw among the nations

16
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:17,291
 of the Gentiles the formation of a great church

17
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:32,104
5 And the angel said unto me: Behold the formation

18
00:02:32,104 --> 00:02:46,771
 of a church which is most abominable above all

19
00:02:46,771 --> 00:03:01,438
 other churches, which slayeth the saints of God,

20
00:03:01,438 --> 00:03:16,105
 yea, and tortureth them and bindeth them down, and

21
00:03:16,105 --> 00:03:30,772
 yoketh them with a yoke of iron, and bringeth them

22
00:03:30,772 --> 00:03:45,439
 down into captivity

23
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:47,825
6 And it came to pass that I beheld this great and

24
00:03:47,825 --> 00:03:50,492
 abominable church; and I saw the devil that he

25
00:03:50,492 --> 00:03:53,159
 was the founder of it

26
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:53,133
7 And I also saw gold, and silver, and silks, and

27
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:53,133
 scarlets, and fine-twined linen, and all manner of

28
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:53,133
 precious clothing; and I saw many harlots

29
00:03:53,7 --> 00:03:55,9
8 And the angel spake unto me, saying: Behold the

30
00:03:55,9 --> 00:03:58,1
 gold, and the silver, and the silks, and the

31
00:03:58,1 --> 00:04:00,3
 scarlets, and the fine-twined linen, and the precious

32
00:04:00,3 --> 00:04:02,5
 clothing, and the harlots, are the desires of this

33
00:04:02,5 --> 00:04:04,7
 great and abominable church

34
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:09,211
9 And also for the praise of the world do they

35
00:04:09,211 --> 00:04:13,878
 destroy the saints of God, and bring them down into

36
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:18,545
 captivity

37
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:25,858
10 And it came to pass that I looked and beheld

38
00:04:25,858 --> 00:04:33,191
 many waters; and they divided the Gentiles from the

39
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:40,524
 seed of my brethren

40
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:45,381
11 And it came to pass that the angel said unto

41
00:04:45,381 --> 00:04:50,048
 me: Behold the wrath of God is upon the seed of thy

42
00:04:50,048 --> 00:04:54,715
 brethren

43
00:04:54,461 --> 00:05:00,604
12 And I looked and beheld a man among the

44
00:05:00,604 --> 00:05:06,747
 Gentiles, who was separated from the seed of my brethren

45
00:05:06,747 --> 00:05:12,89
 by the many waters; and I beheld the Spirit of

46
00:05:12,89 --> 00:05:19,033
 God, that it came down and wrought upon the man; and

47
00:05:19,033 --> 00:05:25,176
 he went forth upon the many waters, even unto the

48
00:05:25,176 --> 00:05:31,319
 seed of my brethren, who were in the promised

49
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:37,462
 land

50
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:42,838
13 And it came to pass that I beheld the Spirit of

51
00:05:42,838 --> 00:05:47,838
 God, that it wrought upon other Gentiles; and

52
00:05:47,838 --> 00:05:52,838
 they went forth out of captivity, upon the many

53
00:05:52,838 --> 00:05:57,838
 waters

54
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:04,058
14 And it came to pass that I beheld many

55
00:06:04,058 --> 00:06:10,257
 multitudes of the Gentiles upon the land of promise; and I

56
00:06:10,257 --> 00:06:16,458
 beheld the wrath of God, that it was upon the

57
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:22,658
 seed of my brethren; and they were scattered before

58
00:06:22,658 --> 00:06:28,858
 the Gentiles and were smitten

59
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:31,755
15 And I beheld the Spirit of the Lord, that it

60
00:06:31,755 --> 00:06:34,955
 was upon the Gentiles, and they did prosper and

61
00:06:34,955 --> 00:06:38,155
 obtain the land for their inheritance; and I beheld

62
00:06:38,155 --> 00:06:41,355
 that they were white, and exceedingly fair and

63
00:06:41,355 --> 00:06:44,555
 beautiful, like unto my people before they were slain

64
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:55,754
16 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld that

65
00:06:55,754 --> 00:07:07,004
 the Gentiles who had gone forth out of captivity

66
00:07:07,004 --> 00:07:18,254
 did humble themselves before the Lord; and the

67
00:07:18,254 --> 00:07:29,504
 power of the Lord was with them

68
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:36,65
17 And I beheld that their mother Gentiles were

69
00:07:36,65 --> 00:07:43,317
 gathered together upon the waters, and upon the land

70
00:07:43,317 --> 00:07:49,984
 also, to battle against them

71
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:54,236
18 And I beheld that the power of God was with

72
00:07:54,236 --> 00:07:58,736
 them, and also that the wrath of God was upon all

73
00:07:58,736 --> 00:08:03,236
 those that were gathered together against them to

74
00:08:03,236 --> 00:08:07,736
 battle

75
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:17,521
19 And I, Nephi, beheld that the Gentiles that had

76
00:08:17,521 --> 00:08:27,188
 gone out of captivity were delivered by the power

77
00:08:27,188 --> 00:08:36,855
 of God out of the hands of all other nations

78
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:42,183
20 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld that

79
00:08:42,183 --> 00:08:47,85
 they did prosper in the land; and I beheld a book,

80
00:08:47,85 --> 00:08:53,517
 and it was carried forth among them

81
00:08:53,633 --> 00:09:01,633
21 And the angel said unto me: Knowest thou the

82
00:09:01,633 --> 00:09:09,633
 meaning of the book

83
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:18,582
22 And I said unto him: I know not

84
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:24,342
23 And he said: Behold it proceedeth out of the

85
00:09:24,342 --> 00:09:30,259
 mouth of a Jew. And I, Nephi, beheld it; and he said

86
00:09:30,259 --> 00:09:36,176
 unto me: The book that thou beholdest is a record

87
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:42,093
 of the Jews, which contains the covenants of the

88
00:09:42,093 --> 00:09:48,01
 Lord, which he hath made unto the house of Israel;

89
00:09:48,01 --> 00:09:53,927
 and it also containeth many of the prophecies of

90
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:59,844
 the holy prophets; and it is a record like unto

91
00:09:59,844 --> 00:10:05,761
 the engravings which are upon the plates of brass,

92
00:10:05,761 --> 00:10:11,678
 save there are not so many; nevertheless, they

93
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:17,595
 contain the covenants of the Lord, which he hath made

94
00:10:17,595 --> 00:10:23,512
 unto the house of Israel; wherefore, they are of

95
00:10:23,512 --> 00:10:29,429
 great worth unto the Gentiles

96
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:34,885
24 And the angel of the Lord said unto me: Thou

97
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:40,742
 hast beheld that the book proceeded forth from the

98
00:10:40,742 --> 00:10:46,599
 mouth of a Jew; and when it proceeded forth from

99
00:10:46,599 --> 00:10:52,456
 the mouth of a Jew it contained the fulness of the

100
00:10:52,456 --> 00:10:58,313
 gospel of the Lord, of whom the twelve apostles

101
00:10:58,313 --> 00:11:04,17
 bear record; and they bear record according to the

102
00:11:04,17 --> 00:11:10,027
 truth which is in the Lamb of God

103
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:15,903
25 Wherefore, these things go forth from the Jews

104
00:11:15,903 --> 00:11:21,57
 in purity unto the Gentiles, according to the

105
00:11:21,57 --> 00:11:27,237
 truth which is in God

106
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:33,961
26 And after they go forth by the hand of the

107
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:40,836
 twelve apostles of the Lamb, from the Jews unto the

108
00:11:40,836 --> 00:11:47,711
 Gentiles, thou seest the formation of that great and

109
00:11:47,711 --> 00:11:54,586
 abominable church, which is most abominable above

110
00:11:54,586 --> 00:12:01,461
 all other churches; for behold, they have taken

111
00:12:01,461 --> 00:12:08,336
 away from the gospel of the Lamb many parts which

112
00:12:08,336 --> 00:12:15,211
 are plain and most precious; and also many

113
00:12:15,211 --> 00:12:22,086
 covenants of the Lord have they taken away

114
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:27,942
27 And all this have they done that they might

115
00:12:27,942 --> 00:12:33,442
 pervert the right ways of the Lord, that they might

116
00:12:33,442 --> 00:12:38,942
 blind the eyes and harden the hearts of the

117
00:12:38,942 --> 00:12:44,442
 children of men

118
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:50,097
28 Wherefore, thou seest that after the book hath

119
00:12:50,097 --> 00:12:55,697
 gone forth through the hands of the great and

120
00:12:55,697 --> 00:13:01,297
 abominable church, that there are many plain and

121
00:13:01,297 --> 00:13:06,897
 precious things taken away from the book, which is the

122
00:13:06,897 --> 00:13:12,497
 book of the Lamb of God

123
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:18,525
29 And after these plain and precious things were

124
00:13:18,525 --> 00:13:24,525
 taken away it goeth forth unto all the nations of

125
00:13:24,525 --> 00:13:30,525
 the Gentiles; and after it goeth forth unto all

126
00:13:30,525 --> 00:13:36,525
 the nations of the Gentiles, yea, even across the

127
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:42,525
 many waters which thou hast seen with the Gentiles

128
00:13:42,525 --> 00:13:48,525
 which have gone forth out of captivity, thou

129
00:13:48,525 --> 00:13:54,525
 seest—because of the many plain and precious things

130
00:13:54,525 --> 00:14:00,525
 which have been taken out of the book, which were

131
00:14:00,525 --> 00:14:06,525
 plain unto the understanding of the children of men,

132
00:14:06,525 --> 00:14:12,525
 according to the plainness which is in the Lamb of

133
00:14:12,525 --> 00:14:18,525
 God—because of these things which are taken away

134
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:24,525
 out of the gospel of the Lamb, an exceedingly great

135
00:14:24,525 --> 00:14:30,525
 many do stumble, yea, insomuch that Satan hath

136
00:14:30,525 --> 00:14:36,525
 great power over them

137
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:44,911
30 Nevertheless, thou beholdest that the Gentiles

138
00:14:44,911 --> 00:14:53,547
 who have gone forth out of captivity, and have

139
00:14:53,547 --> 00:15:02,183
 been lifted up by the power of God above all other

140
00:15:02,183 --> 00:15:10,819
 nations, upon the face of the land which is choice

141
00:15:10,819 --> 00:15:19,455
 above all other lands, which is the land that the

142
00:15:19,455 --> 00:15:28,091
 Lord God hath covenanted with thy father that his

143
00:15:28,091 --> 00:15:36,727
 seed should have for the land of their inheritance;

144
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:45,363
 wherefore, thou seest that the Lord God will not

145
00:15:45,363 --> 00:15:53,999
 suffer that the Gentiles will utterly destroy the

146
00:15:53,999 --> 00:16:02,635
 mixture of thy seed, which are among thy brethren

147
00:16:02,635 --> 00:16:11,271


148
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:12,971
31 Neither will he suffer that the Gentiles shall

149
00:16:12,971 --> 00:16:13,971
 destroy the seed of thy brethren

150
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:16,572
32 Neither will the Lord God suffer that the

151
00:16:16,572 --> 00:16:20,072
 Gentiles shall forever remain in that awful state of

152
00:16:20,072 --> 00:16:23,572
 blindness, which thou beholdest they are in, because

153
00:16:23,572 --> 00:16:27,072
 of the plain and most precious parts of the

154
00:16:27,072 --> 00:16:30,572
 gospel of the Lamb which have been kept back by that

155
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:34,072
 abominable church, whose formation thou hast seen

156
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:41,594
33 Wherefore saith the Lamb of God: I will be

157
00:16:41,594 --> 00:16:48,594
 merciful unto the Gentiles, unto the visiting of the

158
00:16:48,594 --> 00:16:55,594
 remnant of the house of Israel in great judgment

159
00:16:55,815 --> 00:17:02,548
34 And it came to pass that the angel of the Lord

160
00:17:02,548 --> 00:17:09,281
 spake unto me, saying: Behold, saith the Lamb of

161
00:17:09,281 --> 00:17:16,014
 God, after I have visited the remnant of the house

162
00:17:16,014 --> 00:17:22,747
 of Israel—and this remnant of whom I speak is the

163
00:17:22,747 --> 00:17:29,48
 seed of thy father—wherefore, after I have visited

164
00:17:29,48 --> 00:17:36,213
 them in judgment, and smitten them by the hand of

165
00:17:36,213 --> 00:17:42,946
 the Gentiles, and after the Gentiles do stumble

166
00:17:42,946 --> 00:17:49,679
 exceedingly, because of the most plain and precious

167
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:56,412
 parts of the gospel of the Lamb which have been

168
00:17:56,412 --> 00:18:03,145
 kept back by that abominable church, which is the

169
00:18:03,145 --> 00:18:09,878
 mother of harlots, saith the Lamb—I will be

170
00:18:09,878 --> 00:18:16,611
 merciful unto the Gentiles in that day, insomuch that I

171
00:18:16,611 --> 00:18:23,344
 will bring forth unto them, in mine own power, much

172
00:18:23,344 --> 00:18:30,077
 of my gospel, which shall be plain and precious,

173
00:18:30,077 --> 00:18:36,81
 saith the Lamb

174
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:43,457
35 For, behold, saith the Lamb: I will manifest

175
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:50,332
 myself unto thy seed, that they shall write many

176
00:18:50,332 --> 00:18:57,207
 things which I shall minister unto them, which shall

177
00:18:57,207 --> 00:19:04,082
 be plain and precious; and after thy seed shall be

178
00:19:04,082 --> 00:19:10,957
 destroyed, and dwindle in unbelief, and also the

179
00:19:10,957 --> 00:19:17,832
 seed of thy brethren, behold, these things shall

180
00:19:17,832 --> 00:19:24,707
 be hid up, to come forth unto the Gentiles, by the

181
00:19:24,707 --> 00:19:31,582
 gift and power of the Lamb

182
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:38,537
36 And in them shall be written my gospel, saith

183
00:19:38,537 --> 00:19:45,537
 the Lamb, and my rock and my salvation

184
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:53,067
37 And blessed are they who shall seek to bring

185
00:19:53,067 --> 00:20:00,817
 forth my Zion at that day, for they shall have the

186
00:20:00,817 --> 00:20:08,567
 gift and the power of the Holy Ghost; and if they

187
00:20:08,567 --> 00:20:16,317
 endure unto the end they shall be lifted up at the

188
00:20:16,317 --> 00:20:24,067
 last day, and shall be saved in the everlasting

189
00:20:24,067 --> 00:20:31,817
 kingdom of the Lamb; and whoso shall publish peace,

190
00:20:31,817 --> 00:20:39,567
 yea, tidings of great joy, how beautiful upon the

191
00:20:39,567 --> 00:20:47,317
 mountains shall they be

192
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:53,412
38 And it came to pass that I beheld the remnant

193
00:20:53,412 --> 00:20:59,812
 of the seed of my brethren, and also the book of

194
00:20:59,812 --> 00:21:06,212
 the Lamb of God, which had proceeded forth from the

195
00:21:06,212 --> 00:21:12,612
 mouth of the Jew, that it came forth from the

196
00:21:12,612 --> 00:21:19,012
 Gentiles unto the remnant of the seed of my brethren

197
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:26,753
39 And after it had come forth unto them I beheld

198
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:34,128
 other books, which came forth by the power of the

199
00:21:34,128 --> 00:21:41,503
 Lamb, from the Gentiles unto them, unto the

200
00:21:41,503 --> 00:21:48,878
 convincing of the Gentiles and the remnant of the seed

201
00:21:48,878 --> 00:21:56,253
 of my brethren, and also the Jews who were

202
00:21:56,253 --> 00:22:03,628
 scattered upon all the face of the earth, that the records

203
00:22:03,628 --> 00:22:11,003
 of the prophets and of the twelve apostles of the

204
00:22:11,003 --> 00:22:18,378
 Lamb are true

205
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:25,404
40 And the angel spake unto me, saying: These last

206
00:22:25,404 --> 00:22:32,304
 records, which thou hast seen among the Gentiles,

207
00:22:32,304 --> 00:22:39,204
 shall establish the truth of the first, which are

208
00:22:39,204 --> 00:22:46,104
 of the twelve apostles of the Lamb, and shall

209
00:22:46,104 --> 00:22:53,004
 make known the plain and precious things which have

210
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:59,904
 been taken away from them; and shall make known to

211
00:22:59,904 --> 00:23:06,804
 all kindreds, tongues, and people, that the Lamb

212
00:23:06,804 --> 00:23:13,704
 of God is the Son of the Eternal Father, and the

213
00:23:13,704 --> 00:23:20,604
 Savior of the world; and that all men must come unto

214
00:23:20,604 --> 00:23:27,504
 him, or they cannot be saved

215
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:33,935
41 And they must come according to the words which

216
00:23:33,935 --> 00:23:40,364
 shall be established by the mouth of the Lamb;

217
00:23:40,364 --> 00:23:46,793
 and the words of the Lamb shall be made known in the

218
00:23:46,793 --> 00:23:53,222
 records of thy seed, as well as in the records of

219
00:23:53,222 --> 00:23:59,651
 the twelve apostles of the Lamb; wherefore they

220
00:23:59,651 --> 00:24:06,08
 both shall be established in one; for there is one

221
00:24:06,08 --> 00:24:12,509
 God and one Shepherd over all the earth

222
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:12,151
42 And the time cometh that he shall manifest

223
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:12,151
 himself unto all nations, both unto the Jews and also

224
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:12,151
 unto the Gentiles; and after he has manifested

225
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:12,151
 himself unto the Jews and also unto the Gentiles,

226
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:12,151
 then he shall manifest himself unto the Gentiles and

227
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:12,151
 also unto the Jews, and the last shall be first,

228
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:12,151
 and the first shall be last.
