00:00:00,4 --> 00:00:10,567
Chapter 16 The wicked take the truth to be

2
00:00:10,567 --> 00:00:20,734
 hard—Lehi’s sons marry the daughters of Ishmael—The

3
00:00:20,734 --> 00:00:30,901
 Liahona guides their course in the wilderness—Messages

4
00:00:30,901 --> 00:00:41,068
 from the Lord are written on the Liahona from time

5
00:00:41,068 --> 00:00:51,235
 to time—Ishmael dies; his family murmurs because

6
00:00:51,235 --> 00:01:01,402
 of afflictions. About 600–592 B.C.

7
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:07,444
1 And now it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had

8
00:01:07,444 --> 00:01:13,694
 made an end of speaking to my brethren, behold

9
00:01:13,694 --> 00:01:19,944
 they said unto me: Thou hast declared unto us hard

10
00:01:19,944 --> 00:01:26,194
 things, more than we are able to bear

11
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:32,2
2 And it came to pass that I said unto them that I

12
00:01:32,2 --> 00:01:37,914
 knew that I had spoken hard things against the

13
00:01:37,914 --> 00:01:43,628
 wicked, according to the truth; and the righteous

14
00:01:43,628 --> 00:01:49,342
 have I justified, and testified that they should be

15
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:55,056
 lifted up at the last day; wherefore, the guilty

16
00:01:55,056 --> 00:02:00,77
 taketh the truth to be hard, for it cutteth them to

17
00:02:00,77 --> 00:02:06,484
 the very center

18
00:02:06,36 --> 00:02:13,36
3 And now my brethren, if ye were righteous and

19
00:02:13,36 --> 00:02:20,36
 were willing to hearken to the truth, and give heed

20
00:02:20,36 --> 00:02:27,36
 unto it, that ye might walk uprightly before God,

21
00:02:27,36 --> 00:02:34,36
 then ye would not murmur because of the truth, and

22
00:02:34,36 --> 00:02:41,36
 say: Thou speakest hard things against us

23
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:45,961
4 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did exhort my

24
00:02:45,961 --> 00:02:50,628
 brethren, with all diligence, to keep the

25
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:55,295
 commandments of the Lord

26
00:02:55,442 --> 00:03:00,442
5 And it came to pass that they did humble

27
00:03:00,442 --> 00:03:05,442
 themselves before the Lord; insomuch that I had joy and

28
00:03:05,442 --> 00:03:10,442
 great hopes of them, that they would walk in the

29
00:03:10,442 --> 00:03:15,442
 paths of righteousness

30
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:20,028
6 Now, all these things were said and done as my

31
00:03:20,028 --> 00:03:25,028
 father dwelt in a tent in the valley which he

32
00:03:25,028 --> 00:03:30,028
 called Lemuel

33
00:03:30,01 --> 00:03:36,21
7 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, took one of

34
00:03:36,21 --> 00:03:42,41
 the daughters of Ishmael to wife; and also, my

35
00:03:42,41 --> 00:03:48,61
 brethren took of the daughters of Ishmael to wife; and

36
00:03:48,61 --> 00:03:54,81
 also Zoram took the eldest daughter of Ishmael to

37
00:03:54,81 --> 00:04:01,01
 wife

38
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:07,441
8 And thus my father had fulfilled all the

39
00:04:07,441 --> 00:04:13,441
 commandments of the Lord which had been given unto him.

40
00:04:13,441 --> 00:04:19,441
 And also, I, Nephi, had been blessed of the Lord

41
00:04:19,441 --> 00:04:25,441
 exceedingly

42
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:29,815
9 And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord

43
00:04:29,815 --> 00:04:34,065
 spake unto my father by night, and commanded him

44
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:38,315
 that on the morrow he should take his journey into

45
00:04:38,315 --> 00:04:42,565
 the wilderness

46
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:48,759
10 And it came to pass that as my father arose in

47
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:54,902
 the morning, and went forth to the tent door, to

48
00:04:54,902 --> 00:05:01,045
 his great astonishment he beheld upon the ground a

49
00:05:01,045 --> 00:05:07,188
 round ball of curious workmanship; and it was of

50
00:05:07,188 --> 00:05:13,331
 fine brass. And within the ball were two spindles;

51
00:05:13,331 --> 00:05:19,474
 and the one pointed the way whither we should go

52
00:05:19,474 --> 00:05:25,617
 into the wilderness

53
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:29,558
11 And it came to pass that we did gather together

54
00:05:29,558 --> 00:05:34,058
 whatsoever things we should carry into the

55
00:05:34,058 --> 00:05:38,558
 wilderness, and all the remainder of our provisions

56
00:05:38,558 --> 00:05:43,058
 which the Lord had given unto us; and we did take seed

57
00:05:43,058 --> 00:05:47,558
 of every kind that we might carry into the

58
00:05:47,558 --> 00:05:52,058
 wilderness

59
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:57,819
12 And it came to pass that we did take our tents

60
00:05:57,819 --> 00:06:02,819
 and depart into the wilderness, across the river

61
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:07,819
 Laman

62
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:12,883
13 And it came to pass that we traveled for the

63
00:06:12,883 --> 00:06:18,633
 space of four days, nearly a south-southeast

64
00:06:18,633 --> 00:06:24,383
 direction, and we did pitch our tents again; and we did

65
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:30,133
 call the name of the place Shazer

66
00:06:30,59 --> 00:06:36,701
14 And it came to pass that we did take our bows

67
00:06:36,701 --> 00:06:42,812
 and our arrows, and go forth into the wilderness to

68
00:06:42,812 --> 00:06:48,923
 slay food for our families; and after we had

69
00:06:48,923 --> 00:06:55,034
 slain food for our families we did return again to our

70
00:06:55,034 --> 00:07:01,145
 families in the wilderness, to the place of

71
00:07:01,145 --> 00:07:07,256
 Shazer. And we did go forth again in the wilderness,

72
00:07:07,256 --> 00:07:13,367
 following the same direction, keeping in the most

73
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:19,478
 fertile parts of the wilderness, which were in the

74
00:07:19,478 --> 00:07:25,589
 borders near the Red Sea

75
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:31,212
15 And it came to pass that we did travel for the

76
00:07:31,212 --> 00:07:36,712
 space of many days, slaying food by the way, with

77
00:07:36,712 --> 00:07:42,212
 our bows and our arrows and our stones and our

78
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:47,712
 slings

79
00:07:47,2 --> 00:07:52,533
16 And we did follow the directions of the ball,

80
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:57,866
 which led us in the more fertile parts of the

81
00:07:57,866 --> 00:08:03,199
 wilderness

82
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:09,016
17 And after we had traveled for the space of many

83
00:08:09,016 --> 00:08:14,516
 days, we did pitch our tents for the space of a

84
00:08:14,516 --> 00:08:20,016
 time, that we might again rest ourselves and obtain

85
00:08:20,016 --> 00:08:25,516
 food for our families

86
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:30,939
18 And it came to pass that as I, Nephi, went

87
00:08:30,939 --> 00:08:36,106
 forth to slay food, behold, I did break my bow, which

88
00:08:36,106 --> 00:08:41,273
 was made of fine steel; and after I did break my

89
00:08:41,273 --> 00:08:46,44
 bow, behold, my brethren were angry with me because

90
00:08:46,44 --> 00:08:51,607
 of the loss of my bow, for we did obtain no food

91
00:08:51,607 --> 00:08:56,774


92
00:08:56,97 --> 00:09:01,47
19 And it came to pass that we did return without

93
00:09:01,47 --> 00:09:05,97
 food to our families, and being much fatigued,

94
00:09:05,97 --> 00:09:10,47
 because of their journeying, they did suffer much for

95
00:09:10,47 --> 00:09:14,97
 the want of food

96
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:20,668
20 And it came to pass that Laman and Lemuel and

97
00:09:20,668 --> 00:09:26,382
 the sons of Ishmael did begin to murmur

98
00:09:26,382 --> 00:09:32,096
 exceedingly, because of their sufferings and afflictions in

99
00:09:32,096 --> 00:09:37,81
 the wilderness; and also my father began to murmur

100
00:09:37,81 --> 00:09:43,524
 against the Lord his God; yea, and they were all

101
00:09:43,524 --> 00:09:49,238
 exceedingly sorrowful, even that they did murmur

102
00:09:49,238 --> 00:09:54,952
 against the Lord

103
00:09:54,294 --> 00:10:00,694
21 Now it came to pass that I, Nephi, having been

104
00:10:00,694 --> 00:10:07,094
 afflicted with my brethren because of the loss of

105
00:10:07,094 --> 00:10:13,494
 my bow, and their bows having lost their springs,

106
00:10:13,494 --> 00:10:19,894
 it began to be exceedingly difficult, yea,

107
00:10:19,894 --> 00:10:26,294
 insomuch that we could obtain no food

108
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:32,076
22 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did speak

109
00:10:32,076 --> 00:10:37,326
 much unto my brethren, because they had hardened

110
00:10:37,326 --> 00:10:42,576
 their hearts again, even unto complaining against the

111
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:47,826
 Lord their God

112
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:54,647
23 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did make out

113
00:10:54,647 --> 00:11:01,447
 of wood a bow, and out of a straight stick, an

114
00:11:01,447 --> 00:11:08,247
 arrow; wherefore, I did arm myself with a bow and an

115
00:11:08,247 --> 00:11:15,047
 arrow, with a sling and with stones. And I said

116
00:11:15,047 --> 00:11:21,847
 unto my father: Whither shall I go to obtain food

117
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:27,598
24 And it came to pass that he did inquire of the

118
00:11:27,598 --> 00:11:33,348
 Lord, for they had humbled themselves because of

119
00:11:33,348 --> 00:11:39,098
 my words; for I did say many things unto them in

120
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:44,848
 the energy of my soul

121
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:48,737
25 And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord

122
00:11:48,737 --> 00:11:53,337
 came unto my father; and he was truly chastened

123
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:57,937
 because of his murmuring against the Lord, insomuch

124
00:11:57,937 --> 00:12:02,537
 that he was brought down into the depths of

125
00:12:02,537 --> 00:12:07,137
 sorrow

126
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:11,927
26 And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord

127
00:12:11,927 --> 00:12:16,26
 said unto him: Look upon the ball, and behold the

128
00:12:16,26 --> 00:12:20,593
 things which are written

129
00:12:20,44 --> 00:12:26,44
27 And it came to pass that when my father beheld

130
00:12:26,44 --> 00:12:32,44
 the things which were written upon the ball, he

131
00:12:32,44 --> 00:12:38,44
 did fear and tremble exceedingly, and also my

132
00:12:38,44 --> 00:12:44,44
 brethren and the sons of Ishmael and our wives

133
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:49,364
28 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld the

134
00:12:49,364 --> 00:12:54,364
 pointers which were in the ball, that they did work

135
00:12:54,364 --> 00:12:59,364
 according to the faith and diligence and heed

136
00:12:59,364 --> 00:13:04,364
 which we did give unto them

137
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:10,741
29 And there was also written upon them a new

138
00:13:10,741 --> 00:13:16,598
 writing, which was plain to be read, which did give us

139
00:13:16,598 --> 00:13:22,455
 understanding concerning the ways of the Lord;

140
00:13:22,455 --> 00:13:28,312
 and it was written and changed from time to time,

141
00:13:28,312 --> 00:13:34,169
 according to the faith and diligence which we gave

142
00:13:34,169 --> 00:13:40,026
 unto it. And thus we see that by small means the

143
00:13:40,026 --> 00:13:45,883
 Lord can bring about great things

144
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:51,158
30 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did go forth

145
00:13:51,158 --> 00:13:56,491
 up into the top of the mountain, according to the

146
00:13:56,491 --> 00:14:01,824
 directions which were given upon the ball

147
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:04,407
31 And it came to pass that I did slay wild

148
00:14:04,407 --> 00:14:07,74
 beasts, insomuch that I did obtain food for our

149
00:14:07,74 --> 00:14:11,073
 families

150
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:16,284
32 And it came to pass that I did return to our

151
00:14:16,284 --> 00:14:20,951
 tents, bearing the beasts which I had slain; and now

152
00:14:20,951 --> 00:14:25,618
 when they beheld that I had obtained food, how

153
00:14:25,618 --> 00:14:30,285
 great was their joy! And it came to pass that they

154
00:14:30,285 --> 00:14:34,952
 did humble themselves before the Lord, and did give

155
00:14:34,952 --> 00:14:39,619
 thanks unto him

156
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:45,946
33 And it came to pass that we did again take our

157
00:14:45,946 --> 00:14:51,946
 journey, traveling nearly the same course as in

158
00:14:51,946 --> 00:14:57,946
 the beginning; and after we had traveled for the

159
00:14:57,946 --> 00:15:03,946
 space of many days we did pitch our tents again, that

160
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:09,946
 we might tarry for the space of a time

161
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:15,409
34 And it came to pass that Ishmael died, and was

162
00:15:15,409 --> 00:15:20,909
 buried in the place which was called Nahom

163
00:15:20,92 --> 00:15:27,32
35 And it came to pass that the daughters of

164
00:15:27,32 --> 00:15:33,72
 Ishmael did mourn exceedingly, because of the loss of

165
00:15:33,72 --> 00:15:40,12
 their father, and because of their afflictions in

166
00:15:40,12 --> 00:15:46,52
 the wilderness; and they did murmur against my

167
00:15:46,52 --> 00:15:52,92
 father, because he had brought them out of the land of

168
00:15:52,92 --> 00:15:59,32
 Jerusalem, saying: Our father is dead; yea, and

169
00:15:59,32 --> 00:16:05,72
 we have wandered much in the wilderness, and we

170
00:16:05,72 --> 00:16:12,12
 have suffered much affliction, hunger, thirst, and

171
00:16:12,12 --> 00:16:18,52
 fatigue; and after all these sufferings we must

172
00:16:18,52 --> 00:16:24,92
 perish in the wilderness with hunger

173
00:16:24,25 --> 00:16:29,917
36 And thus they did murmur against my father, and

174
00:16:29,917 --> 00:16:35,584
 also against me; and they were desirous to return

175
00:16:35,584 --> 00:16:41,251
 again to Jerusalem

176
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:47,267
37 And Laman said unto Lemuel and also unto the

177
00:16:47,267 --> 00:16:53,267
 sons of Ishmael: Behold, let us slay our father, and

178
00:16:53,267 --> 00:16:59,267
 also our brother Nephi, who has taken it upon him

179
00:16:59,267 --> 00:17:05,267
 to be our ruler and our teacher, who are his

180
00:17:05,267 --> 00:17:11,267
 elder brethren

181
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:17,961
38 Now, he says that the Lord has talked with him,

182
00:17:17,961 --> 00:17:24,325
 and also that angels have ministered unto him.

183
00:17:24,325 --> 00:17:30,689
 But behold, we know that he lies unto us; and he

184
00:17:30,689 --> 00:17:37,053
 tells us these things, and he worketh many things by

185
00:17:37,053 --> 00:17:43,417
 his cunning arts, that he may deceive our eyes,

186
00:17:43,417 --> 00:17:49,781
 thinking, perhaps, that he may lead us away into

187
00:17:49,781 --> 00:17:56,145
 some strange wilderness; and after he has led us

188
00:17:56,145 --> 00:18:02,509
 away, he has thought to make himself a king and a

189
00:18:02,509 --> 00:18:08,873
 ruler over us, that he may do with us according to his

190
00:18:08,873 --> 00:18:15,237
 will and pleasure. And after this manner did my

191
00:18:15,237 --> 00:18:21,601
 brother Laman stir up their hearts to anger

192
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:22,309
39 And it came to pass that the Lord was with us,

193
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,184
 yea, even the voice of the Lord came and did speak

194
00:18:23,184 --> 00:18:24,059
 many words unto them, and did chasten them

195
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:24,934
 exceedingly; and after they were chastened by the voice

196
00:18:24,934 --> 00:18:25,809
 of the Lord they did turn away their anger, and

197
00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:26,684
 did repent of their sins, insomuch that the Lord did

198
00:18:26,684 --> 00:18:27,559
 bless us again with food, that we did not perish.

199
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:28,434
