00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 2 Lehi takes his family into the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
wilderness by the Red Sea—They leave their

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
property—Lehi offers a sacrifice to the Lord and teaches his

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
sons to keep the commandments—Laman and Lemuel

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
murmur against their father—Nephi is obedient

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and prays in faith; the Lord speaks to him, and he

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:03:45,
is chosen to rule over his brethren. About 600 B.C. 

8
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
1 For behold, it came to pass that the Lord

9
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
spake unto my father, yea, even in a dream,

10
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
and said unto him: Blessed art thou Lehi,

11
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
because of the things which thou hast done; and

12
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
because thou hast been faithful and declared

13
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
unto this people the things which I commanded

14
00:03:45,0 --> 00:11:42,
thee, behold, they seek to take away thy life.

15
00:11:42,0 --> 00:11:42,0
2 And it came to pass that the

16
00:11:42,0 --> 00:11:42,0
Lord commanded my father, even in a

17
00:11:42,0 --> 00:11:42,0
dream, that he should take his

18
00:11:42,0 --> 00:13:12,
family and depart into the wilderness.

19
00:13:12,0 --> 00:13:12,0
3 And it came to pass that

20
00:13:12,0 --> 00:13:12,0
he was obedient unto the word

21
00:13:12,0 --> 00:13:12,0
of the Lord, wherefore he

22
00:13:12,0 --> 00:14:56,
did as the Lord commanded him.

23
00:14:56,0 --> 00:14:56,0
4 And it came to pass

24
00:14:56,0 --> 00:14:56,0
that he departed into the

25
00:14:56,0 --> 00:14:56,0
wilderness. And he left his

26
00:14:56,0 --> 00:14:56,0
house, and the land of

27
00:14:56,0 --> 00:14:56,0
his inheritance, and his

28
00:14:56,0 --> 00:14:56,0
gold, and his silver, and

29
00:14:56,0 --> 00:14:56,0
his precious things, and

30
00:14:56,0 --> 00:14:56,0
took nothing with him,

31
00:14:56,0 --> 00:14:56,0
save it were his family,

32
00:14:56,0 --> 00:14:56,0
and provisions, and tents,

33
00:14:56,0 --> 00:16:40,
and departed into the wilderness.

34
00:16:40,0 --> 00:16:40,0
5 And he came down by

35
00:16:40,0 --> 00:16:40,0
the borders near the shore

36
00:16:40,0 --> 00:16:40,0
of the Red Sea; and he

37
00:16:40,0 --> 00:16:40,0
traveled in the

38
00:16:40,0 --> 00:16:40,0
wilderness in the borders which

39
00:16:40,0 --> 00:16:40,0
are nearer the Red Sea;

40
00:16:40,0 --> 00:16:40,0
and he did travel in the

41
00:16:40,0 --> 00:16:40,0
wilderness with his

42
00:16:40,0 --> 00:16:40,0
family, which consisted of

43
00:16:40,0 --> 00:16:40,0
my mother, Sariah, and

44
00:16:40,0 --> 00:16:40,0
my elder brothers, who

45
00:16:40,0 --> 00:19:22,
were Laman, Lemuel, and Sam.

46
00:19:22,0 --> 00:19:22,0
6 And it came to pass

47
00:19:22,0 --> 00:19:22,0
that when he had

48
00:19:22,0 --> 00:19:22,0
traveled three days in the

49
00:19:22,0 --> 00:19:22,0
wilderness, he pitched his

50
00:19:22,0 --> 00:19:22,0
tent in a valley by

51
00:19:22,0 --> 00:24:32,
the side of a river of water.

52
00:24:32,0 --> 00:24:32,0
7 And it came to pass

53
00:24:32,0 --> 00:24:32,0
that he built an

54
00:24:32,0 --> 00:24:32,0
altar of stones, and

55
00:24:32,0 --> 00:24:32,0
made an offering unto

56
00:24:32,0 --> 00:24:32,0
the Lord, and gave

57
00:24:32,0 --> 00:27:14,
thanks unto the Lord our God.

58
00:27:14,0 --> 00:27:14,0
8 And it came to

59
00:27:14,0 --> 00:27:14,0
pass that he called

60
00:27:14,0 --> 00:27:14,0
the name of the

61
00:27:14,0 --> 00:27:14,0
river, Laman, and it

62
00:27:14,0 --> 00:27:14,0
emptied into the Red

63
00:27:14,0 --> 00:27:14,0
Sea; and the valley

64
00:27:14,0 --> 00:27:14,0
was in the borders

65
00:27:14,0 --> 00:26:46,
near the mouth thereof.

66
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
9 And when my

67
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
father saw that the

68
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
waters of the

69
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
river emptied into

70
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
the fountain of

71
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
the Red Sea, he

72
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
spake unto Laman,

73
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
saying: O that thou

74
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
mightest be like

75
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
unto this river,

76
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
continually

77
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
running into the

78
00:26:46,0 --> 00:27:00,
fountain of all righteousness!

79
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
10 And he also

80
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
spake unto

81
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
Lemuel: O that thou

82
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
mightest be

83
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
like unto this

84
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
valley, firm and

85
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
steadfast, and

86
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
immovable in

87
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
keeping the

88
00:27:00,0 --> 00:26:46,
commandments of the Lord!

89
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
11 Now this he

90
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
spake because

91
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
of the

92
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
stiffneckedness of

93
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
Laman and

94
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
Lemuel; for behold

95
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
they did

96
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
murmur in many

97
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
things against

98
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
their father,

99
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
because he was a

100
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
visionary man,

101
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
and had led

102
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
them out of the

103
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
land of

104
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
Jerusalem, to leave

105
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
the land of

106
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
their

107
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
inheritance, and their

108
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
gold, and

109
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
their silver, and

110
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
their precious

111
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
things, to

112
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
perish in the

113
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
wilderness. And

114
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
this they said

115
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
he had done

116
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
because of the

117
00:26:46,0 --> 00:27:00,
foolish imaginations of his heart.

118
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
12 And thus

119
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
Laman and

120
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
Lemuel, being the

121
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
eldest, did

122
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
murmur

123
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
against their

124
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
father. And they

125
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
did murmur

126
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
because they

127
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
knew not the

128
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
dealings of that

129
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
God who had

130
00:27:00,0 --> 00:26:46,
created them.

131
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
13 Neither

132
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
did they

133
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
believe that

134
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
Jerusalem, that

135
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
great city,

136
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
could be

137
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
destroyed

138
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
according to the

139
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
words of

140
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
the prophets.

141
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
And they

142
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
were like unto

143
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
the Jews who

144
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
were at

145
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
Jerusalem, who

146
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
sought to

147
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
take away the

148
00:26:46,0 --> 00:27:00,
life of my father.

149
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
14 And it

150
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
came to pass

151
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
that my

152
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
father did

153
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
speak unto

154
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
them in the

155
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
valley of

156
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
Lemuel, with

157
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
power,

158
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
being filled

159
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
with the

160
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
Spirit, until

161
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
their frames

162
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
did shake

163
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
before him.

164
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
And he did

165
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
confound

166
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
them, that

167
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
they durst

168
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
not utter

169
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
against him;

170
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
wherefore,

171
00:27:00,0 --> 00:26:46,
they did as he commanded them.

172
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
15 And my

173
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
father dwelt

174
00:26:46,0 --> 00:27:00,
in a tent.

175
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
16 And it

176
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
came to

177
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
pass that I,

178
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
Nephi,

179
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
being

180
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
exceedingly

181
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
young,

182
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
nevertheless

183
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
being large in

184
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
stature,

185
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
and also

186
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
having

187
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
great desires

188
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
to know of

189
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
the

190
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
mysteries of

191
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
God,

192
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
wherefore, I did

193
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
cry unto

194
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
the Lord;

195
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
and behold

196
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
he did

197
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
visit me, and

198
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
did

199
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
soften my heart

200
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
that I

201
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
did believe

202
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
all the

203
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
words which

204
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
had been

205
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
spoken by

206
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
my father;

207
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
wherefore,

208
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
I did not

209
00:27:00,0 --> 00:26:46,
rebel against him like unto my brothers.

210
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
17 And I

211
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
spake

212
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
unto Sam,

213
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
making

214
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
known unto

215
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
him the

216
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
things which

217
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
the Lord

218
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
had

219
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
manifested

220
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
unto me by

221
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
his Holy

222
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
Spirit.

223
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
And it

224
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
came to pass

225

227
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
18 But,

228
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
behold,

00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
Laman

230
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0

00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0
because of

239
00:27:00,0 --> 00:27:00,0

the Lord for them.

245
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
19 And

246
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
it came

247
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0

252
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0

253
00:26:46,0 --> 00:26:46,0
