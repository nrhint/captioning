00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,286
Chapter 2 Lehi takes his family into the

2
00:00:01,286 --> 00:00:02,572
wilderness by the Red Sea—They leave their

3
00:00:02,572 --> 00:00:03,858
property—Lehi offers a sacrifice to the Lord and teaches his

4
00:00:03,858 --> 00:00:05,144
sons to keep the commandments—Laman and Lemuel

5
00:00:05,144 --> 00:00:06,43
murmur against their father—Nephi is obedient

6
00:00:06,43 --> 00:00:07,716
and prays in faith; the Lord speaks to him, and he

7
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:09,443
is chosen to rule over his brethren. About 600 B.C. 

8
00:00:09,443 --> 00:00:10,014
1 For behold, it came to pass that the Lord

9
00:00:10,014 --> 00:00:10,585
spake unto my father, yea, even in a dream,

10
00:00:10,585 --> 00:00:11,156
and said unto him: Blessed art thou Lehi,

11
00:00:11,156 --> 00:00:11,727
because of the things which thou hast done; and

12
00:00:11,727 --> 00:00:12,298
because thou hast been faithful and declared

13
00:00:12,298 --> 00:00:12,869
unto this people the things which I commanded

14
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:13,38
thee, behold, they seek to take away thy life.

15
00:00:13,38 --> 00:00:13,88
2 And it came to pass that the

16
00:00:13,88 --> 00:00:14,38
Lord commanded my father, even in a

17
00:00:14,38 --> 00:00:14,88
dream, that he should take his

18
00:00:14,88 --> 00:00:15,782
family and depart into the wilderness.

19
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:18,032
3 And it came to pass that

20
00:00:18,032 --> 00:00:20,282
he was obedient unto the word

21
00:00:20,282 --> 00:00:22,532
of the Lord, wherefore he

22
00:00:22,532 --> 00:00:24,758
did as the Lord commanded him.

23
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:26,303
4 And it came to pass

24
00:00:26,303 --> 00:00:27,848
that he departed into the

25
00:00:27,848 --> 00:00:29,393
wilderness. And he left his

26
00:00:29,393 --> 00:00:30,938
house, and the land of

27
00:00:30,938 --> 00:00:32,483
his inheritance, and his

28
00:00:32,483 --> 00:00:34,028
gold, and his silver, and

29
00:00:34,028 --> 00:00:35,573
his precious things, and

30
00:00:35,573 --> 00:00:37,118
took nothing with him,

31
00:00:37,118 --> 00:00:38,663
save it were his family,

32
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:40,208
and provisions, and tents,

33
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:41,675
and departed into the wilderness.

34
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:43,092
5 And he came down by

35
00:00:43,092 --> 00:00:44,509
the borders near the shore

36
00:00:44,509 --> 00:00:45,926
of the Red Sea; and he

37
00:00:45,926 --> 00:00:47,343
traveled in the

38
00:00:47,343 --> 00:00:48,76
wilderness in the borders which

39
00:00:48,76 --> 00:00:50,177
are nearer the Red Sea;

40
00:00:50,177 --> 00:00:51,594
and he did travel in the

41
00:00:51,594 --> 00:00:53,011
wilderness with his

42
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,428
family, which consisted of

43
00:00:54,428 --> 00:00:55,845
my mother, Sariah, and

44
00:00:55,845 --> 00:00:57,262
my elder brothers, who

45
00:00:57,262 --> 00:00:58,091
were Laman, Lemuel, and Sam.

46
00:00:58,091 --> 00:00:58,591
6 And it came to pass

47
00:00:58,591 --> 00:00:59,091
that when he had

48
00:00:59,091 --> 00:00:59,591
traveled three days in the

49
00:00:59,591 --> 00:01:00,091
wilderness, he pitched his

50
00:01:00,091 --> 00:01:00,591
tent in a valley by

51
00:01:00,591 --> 00:01:01,094
the side of a river of water.

52
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:01,927
7 And it came to pass

53
00:01:01,927 --> 00:01:02,76
that he built an

54
00:01:02,76 --> 00:01:03,593
altar of stones, and

55
00:01:03,593 --> 00:01:04,426
made an offering unto

56
00:01:04,426 --> 00:01:05,259
the Lord, and gave

57
00:01:05,259 --> 00:01:06,033
thanks unto the Lord our God.

58
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:06,658
8 And it came to

59
00:01:06,658 --> 00:01:07,283
pass that he called

60
00:01:07,283 --> 00:01:07,908
the name of the

61
00:01:07,908 --> 00:01:08,533
river, Laman, and it

62
00:01:08,533 --> 00:01:09,158
emptied into the Red

63
00:01:09,158 --> 00:01:09,783
Sea; and the valley

64
00:01:09,783 --> 00:01:10,408
was in the borders

65
00:01:10,408 --> 00:01:11,438
near the mouth thereof.

66
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:12,438
9 And when my

67
00:01:12,438 --> 00:01:13,438
father saw that the

68
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:14,438
waters of the

69
00:01:14,438 --> 00:01:15,438
river emptied into

70
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:16,438
the fountain of

71
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:17,438
the Red Sea, he

72
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:18,438
spake unto Laman,

73
00:01:18,438 --> 00:01:19,438
saying: O that thou

74
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:20,438
mightest be like

75
00:01:20,438 --> 00:01:21,438
unto this river,

76
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:22,438
continually

77
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:23,438
running into the

78
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:24,318
fountain of all righteousness!

79
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:24,918
10 And he also

80
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:25,518
spake unto

81
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:26,118
Lemuel: O that thou

82
00:01:26,118 --> 00:01:26,718
mightest be

83
00:01:26,718 --> 00:01:27,318
like unto this

84
00:01:27,318 --> 00:01:27,918
valley, firm and

85
00:01:27,918 --> 00:01:28,518
steadfast, and

86
00:01:28,518 --> 00:01:29,118
immovable in

87
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:29,718
keeping the

88
00:01:29,718 --> 00:01:30,19
commandments of the Lord!

89
00:01:30,19 --> 00:01:30,604
11 Now this he

90
00:01:30,604 --> 00:01:31,018
spake because

91
00:01:31,018 --> 00:01:31,432
of the

92
00:01:31,432 --> 00:01:31,846
stiffneckedness of

93
00:01:31,846 --> 00:01:32,26
Laman and

94
00:01:32,26 --> 00:01:32,674
Lemuel; for behold

95
00:01:32,674 --> 00:01:33,088
they did

96
00:01:33,088 --> 00:01:33,502
murmur in many

97
00:01:33,502 --> 00:01:33,916
things against

98
00:01:33,916 --> 00:01:34,33
their father,

99
00:01:34,33 --> 00:01:34,744
because he was a

100
00:01:34,744 --> 00:01:35,158
visionary man,

101
00:01:35,158 --> 00:01:35,572
and had led

102
00:01:35,572 --> 00:01:35,986
them out of the

103
00:01:35,986 --> 00:01:36,4
land of

104
00:01:36,4 --> 00:01:36,814
Jerusalem, to leave

105
00:01:36,814 --> 00:01:37,228
the land of

106
00:01:37,228 --> 00:01:37,642
their

107
00:01:37,642 --> 00:01:38,056
inheritance, and their

108
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:38,47
gold, and

109
00:01:38,47 --> 00:01:38,884
their silver, and

110
00:01:38,884 --> 00:01:39,298
their precious

111
00:01:39,298 --> 00:01:39,712
things, to

112
00:01:39,712 --> 00:01:40,126
perish in the

113
00:01:40,126 --> 00:01:40,54
wilderness. And

114
00:01:40,54 --> 00:01:40,954
this they said

115
00:01:40,954 --> 00:01:41,368
he had done

116
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:41,782
because of the

117
00:01:41,782 --> 00:01:42,536
foolish imaginations of his heart.

118
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:43,151
12 And thus

119
00:01:43,151 --> 00:01:43,766
Laman and

120
00:01:43,766 --> 00:01:44,381
Lemuel, being the

121
00:01:44,381 --> 00:01:44,996
eldest, did

122
00:01:44,996 --> 00:01:45,611
murmur

123
00:01:45,611 --> 00:01:46,226
against their

124
00:01:46,226 --> 00:01:46,841
father. And they

125
00:01:46,841 --> 00:01:47,456
did murmur

126
00:01:47,456 --> 00:01:48,071
because they

127
00:01:48,071 --> 00:01:48,686
knew not the

128
00:01:48,686 --> 00:01:49,301
dealings of that

129
00:01:49,301 --> 00:01:49,916
God who had

130
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:50,944
created them.

131
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:51,888
13 Neither

132
00:01:51,888 --> 00:01:52,832
did they

133
00:01:52,832 --> 00:01:53,776
believe that

134
00:01:53,776 --> 00:01:54,72
Jerusalem, that

135
00:01:54,72 --> 00:01:55,664
great city,

136
00:01:55,664 --> 00:01:56,608
could be

137
00:01:56,608 --> 00:01:57,552
destroyed

138
00:01:57,552 --> 00:01:58,496
according to the

139
00:01:58,496 --> 00:01:59,44
words of

140
00:01:59,44 --> 00:02:00,384
the prophets.

141
00:02:00,384 --> 00:02:01,328
And they

142
00:02:01,328 --> 00:02:02,272
were like unto

143
00:02:02,272 --> 00:02:03,216
the Jews who

144
00:02:03,216 --> 00:02:04,16
were at

145
00:02:04,16 --> 00:02:05,104
Jerusalem, who

146
00:02:05,104 --> 00:02:06,048
sought to

147
00:02:06,048 --> 00:02:06,992
take away the

148
00:02:06,992 --> 00:02:07,861
life of my father.

149
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:08,165
14 And it

150
00:02:08,165 --> 00:02:08,469
came to pass

151
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:08,773
that my

152
00:02:08,773 --> 00:02:09,077
father did

153
00:02:09,077 --> 00:02:09,381
speak unto

154
00:02:09,381 --> 00:02:09,685
them in the

155
00:02:09,685 --> 00:02:09,989
valley of

156
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:10,293
Lemuel, with

157
00:02:10,293 --> 00:02:10,597
power,

158
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:10,901
being filled

159
00:02:10,901 --> 00:02:11,205
with the

160
00:02:11,205 --> 00:02:11,509
Spirit, until

161
00:02:11,509 --> 00:02:11,813
their frames

162
00:02:11,813 --> 00:02:12,117
did shake

163
00:02:12,117 --> 00:02:12,421
before him.

164
00:02:12,421 --> 00:02:12,725
And he did

165
00:02:12,725 --> 00:02:13,029
confound

166
00:02:13,029 --> 00:02:13,333
them, that

167
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:13,637
they durst

168
00:02:13,637 --> 00:02:13,941
not utter

169
00:02:13,941 --> 00:02:14,245
against him;

170
00:02:14,245 --> 00:02:14,549
wherefore,

171
00:02:14,549 --> 00:02:14,901
they did as he commanded them.

172
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:17,901
15 And my

173
00:02:17,901 --> 00:02:20,901
father dwelt

174
00:02:20,901 --> 00:02:23,343
in a tent.

175
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:23,972
16 And it

176
00:02:23,972 --> 00:02:24,601
came to

177
00:02:24,601 --> 00:02:25,23
pass that I,

178
00:02:25,23 --> 00:02:25,859
Nephi,

179
00:02:25,859 --> 00:02:26,488
being

180
00:02:26,488 --> 00:02:27,117
exceedingly

181
00:02:27,117 --> 00:02:27,746
young,

182
00:02:27,746 --> 00:02:28,375
nevertheless

183
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:29,004
being large in

184
00:02:29,004 --> 00:02:29,633
stature,

185
00:02:29,633 --> 00:02:30,262
and also

186
00:02:30,262 --> 00:02:30,891
having

187
00:02:30,891 --> 00:02:31,52
great desires

188
00:02:31,52 --> 00:02:32,149
to know of

189
00:02:32,149 --> 00:02:32,778
the

190
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:33,407
mysteries of

191
00:02:33,407 --> 00:02:34,036
God,

192
00:02:34,036 --> 00:02:34,665
wherefore, I did

193
00:02:34,665 --> 00:02:35,294
cry unto

194
00:02:35,294 --> 00:02:35,923
the Lord;

195
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:36,552
and behold

196
00:02:36,552 --> 00:02:37,181
he did

197
00:02:37,181 --> 00:02:37,81
visit me, and

198
00:02:37,81 --> 00:02:38,439
did

199
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:39,068
soften my heart

200
00:02:39,068 --> 00:02:39,697
that I

201
00:02:39,697 --> 00:02:40,326
did believe

202
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:40,955
all the

203
00:02:40,955 --> 00:02:41,584
words which

204
00:02:41,584 --> 00:02:42,213
had been

205
00:02:42,213 --> 00:02:42,842
spoken by

206
00:02:42,842 --> 00:02:43,471
my father;

207
00:02:43,471 --> 00:02:44,1
wherefore,

208
00:02:44,1 --> 00:02:44,729
I did not

209
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:45,165
rebel against him like unto my brothers.

210
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:45,106
17 And I

211
00:02:45,106 --> 00:02:45,047
spake

212
00:02:45,047 --> 00:02:44,988
unto Sam,

213
00:02:44,988 --> 00:02:44,929
making

214
00:02:44,929 --> 00:02:44,87
known unto

215
00:02:44,87 --> 00:02:44,811
him the

216
00:02:44,811 --> 00:02:44,752
things which

217
00:02:44,752 --> 00:02:44,693
the Lord

218
00:02:44,693 --> 00:02:44,634
had

219
00:02:44,634 --> 00:02:44,575
manifested

220
00:02:44,575 --> 00:02:44,516
unto me by

221
00:02:44,516 --> 00:02:44,457
his Holy

222
00:02:44,457 --> 00:02:44,398
Spirit.

223
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:44,339
And it

224
00:02:44,339 --> 00:02:44,28
came to pass

225
00:02:44,28 --> 00:02:44,221
that he

226
00:02:44,221 --> 00:02:44,231
believed in my words.

227
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:44,787
18 But,

228
00:02:44,787 --> 00:02:45,343
behold,

229
00:02:45,343 --> 00:02:45,899
Laman

230
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:46,455
and Lemuel

231
00:02:46,455 --> 00:02:47,011
would

232
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:47,567
not

233
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:48,123
hearken unto

234
00:02:48,123 --> 00:02:48,679
my

235
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:49,235
words; and

236
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:49,791
being

237
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:50,347
grieved

238
00:02:50,347 --> 00:02:50,903
because of

239
00:02:50,903 --> 00:02:51,459
the

240
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:52,015
hardness of

241
00:02:52,015 --> 00:02:52,571
their

242
00:02:52,571 --> 00:02:53,127
hearts I

243
00:02:53,127 --> 00:02:53,683
cried unto

244
00:02:53,683 --> 00:02:54,141
the Lord for them.

245
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:54,379
19 And

246
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:54,617
it came

247
00:02:54,617 --> 00:02:54,855
to

248
00:02:54,855 --> 00:02:55,093
pass that

249
00:02:55,093 --> 00:02:55,331
the

250
00:02:55,331 --> 00:02:55,569
Lord spake

251
00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:55,807
unto

252
00:02:55,807 --> 00:02:56,045
me,

253
00:02:56,045 --> 00:02:56,283
saying:

254
00:02:56,283 --> 00:02:56,521
Blessed

260
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:57,949
