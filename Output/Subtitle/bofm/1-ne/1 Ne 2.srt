00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:08,571
Chapter 2 Lehi takes his family into the

2
00:00:08,571 --> 00:00:17,142
 wilderness by the Red Sea—They leave their property—Lehi

3
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:25,713
 offers a sacrifice to the Lord and teaches his sons

4
00:00:25,713 --> 00:00:34,284
 to keep the commandments—Laman and Lemuel murmur

5
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:42,855
 against their father—Nephi is obedient and prays in

6
00:00:42,855 --> 00:00:51,426
 faith; the Lord speaks to him, and he is chosen

7
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:59,997
 to rule over his brethren. About 600 B.C.

8
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,037
1 For behold, it came to pass that the Lord spake

9
00:01:02,037 --> 00:01:03,18
 unto my father, yea, even in a dream, and said

10
00:01:03,18 --> 00:01:04,323
 unto him: Blessed art thou Lehi, because of the

11
00:01:04,323 --> 00:01:05,466
 things which thou hast done; and because thou hast been

12
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:06,609
 faithful and declared unto this people the things

13
00:01:06,609 --> 00:01:07,752
 which I commanded thee, behold, they seek to take

14
00:01:07,752 --> 00:01:08,895
 away thy life

15
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:14,202
2 And it came to pass that the Lord commanded my

16
00:01:14,202 --> 00:01:19,535
 father, even in a dream, that he should take his

17
00:01:19,535 --> 00:01:24,868
 family and depart into the wilderness

18
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:30,151
3 And it came to pass that he was obedient unto

19
00:01:30,151 --> 00:01:35,484
 the word of the Lord, wherefore he did as the Lord

20
00:01:35,484 --> 00:01:40,817
 commanded him

21
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,434
4 And it came to pass that he departed into the

22
00:01:43,434 --> 00:01:46,101
 wilderness. And he left his house, and the land of

23
00:01:46,101 --> 00:01:48,768
 his inheritance, and his gold, and his silver, and

24
00:01:48,768 --> 00:01:51,435
 his precious things, and took nothing with him,

25
00:01:51,435 --> 00:01:54,102
 save it were his family, and provisions, and tents,

26
00:01:54,102 --> 00:01:56,769
 and departed into the wilderness

27
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:59,384
5 And he came down by the borders near the shore

28
00:01:59,384 --> 00:02:02,051
 of the Red Sea; and he traveled in the wilderness

29
00:02:02,051 --> 00:02:04,718
 in the borders which are nearer the Red Sea; and he

30
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:07,385
 did travel in the wilderness with his family,

31
00:02:07,385 --> 00:02:10,052
 which consisted of my mother, Sariah, and my elder

32
00:02:10,052 --> 00:02:12,719
 brothers, who were Laman, Lemuel, and Sam

33
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:41,999
6 And it came to pass that when he had traveled

34
00:02:41,999 --> 00:03:11,332
 three days in the wilderness, he pitched his tent in

35
00:03:11,332 --> 00:03:40,665
 a valley by the side of a river of water

36
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:52,387
7 And it came to pass that he built an altar of

37
00:03:52,387 --> 00:04:04,387
 stones, and made an offering unto the Lord, and gave

38
00:04:04,387 --> 00:04:16,387
 thanks unto the Lord our God

39
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:34,656
8 And it came to pass that he called the name of

40
00:04:34,656 --> 00:04:52,656
 the river, Laman, and it emptied into the Red Sea;

41
00:04:52,656 --> 00:05:10,656
 and the valley was in the borders near the mouth

42
00:05:10,656 --> 00:05:28,656
 thereof

43
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:28,628
9 And when my father saw that the waters of the

44
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:28,828
 river emptied into the fountain of the Red Sea, he

45
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:29,028
 spake unto Laman, saying: O that thou mightest be

46
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:29,228
 like unto this river, continually running into the

47
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:29,428
 fountain of all righteousness

48
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:30,845
10 And he also spake unto Lemuel: O that thou

49
00:05:30,845 --> 00:05:32,595
 mightest be like unto this valley, firm and steadfast,

50
00:05:32,595 --> 00:05:34,345
 and immovable in keeping the commandments of the

51
00:05:34,345 --> 00:05:36,095
 Lord

52
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:37,025
11 Now this he spake because of the

53
00:05:37,025 --> 00:05:37,914
 stiffneckedness of Laman and Lemuel; for behold they did murmur

54
00:05:37,914 --> 00:05:38,803
 in many things against their father, because he

55
00:05:38,803 --> 00:05:39,692
 was a visionary man, and had led them out of the

56
00:05:39,692 --> 00:05:40,581
 land of Jerusalem, to leave the land of their

57
00:05:40,581 --> 00:05:41,47
 inheritance, and their gold, and their silver, and their

58
00:05:41,47 --> 00:05:42,359
 precious things, to perish in the wilderness. And

59
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:43,248
 this they said he had done because of the foolish

60
00:05:43,248 --> 00:05:44,137
 imaginations of his heart

61
00:05:44,11 --> 00:05:48,11
12 And thus Laman and Lemuel, being the eldest,

62
00:05:48,11 --> 00:05:52,11
 did murmur against their father. And they did murmur

63
00:05:52,11 --> 00:05:56,11
 because they knew not the dealings of that God

64
00:05:56,11 --> 00:06:00,11
 who had created them

65
00:06:00,06 --> 00:06:01,66
13 Neither did they believe that Jerusalem, that

66
00:06:01,66 --> 00:06:03,26
 great city, could be destroyed according to the

67
00:06:03,26 --> 00:06:04,86
 words of the prophets. And they were like unto the

68
00:06:04,86 --> 00:06:06,46
 Jews who were at Jerusalem, who sought to take away

69
00:06:06,46 --> 00:06:08,06
 the life of my father

70
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,367
14 And it came to pass that my father did speak

71
00:06:09,367 --> 00:06:10,7
 unto them in the valley of Lemuel, with power, being

72
00:06:10,7 --> 00:06:12,033
 filled with the Spirit, until their frames did

73
00:06:12,033 --> 00:06:13,366
 shake before him. And he did confound them, that

74
00:06:13,366 --> 00:06:14,699
 they durst not utter against him; wherefore, they did

75
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:16,032
 as he commanded them

76
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:23,009
15 And my father dwelt in a tent

77
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:24,109
16 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, being

78
00:06:24,109 --> 00:06:24,234
 exceedingly young, nevertheless being large in stature,

79
00:06:24,234 --> 00:06:24,359
 and also having great desires to know of the

80
00:06:24,359 --> 00:06:24,484
 mysteries of God, wherefore, I did cry unto the Lord;

81
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:24,609
 and behold he did visit me, and did soften my heart

82
00:06:24,609 --> 00:06:24,734
 that I did believe all the words which had been

83
00:06:24,734 --> 00:06:24,859
 spoken by my father; wherefore, I did not rebel

84
00:06:24,859 --> 00:06:24,984
 against him like unto my brothers

85
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,751
17 And I spake unto Sam, making known unto him the

86
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:28,751
 things which the Lord had manifested unto me by

87
00:06:28,751 --> 00:06:30,751
 his Holy Spirit. And it came to pass that he

88
00:06:30,751 --> 00:06:32,751
 believed in my words

89
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:36,726
18 But, behold, Laman and Lemuel would not hearken

90
00:06:36,726 --> 00:06:40,726
 unto my words; and being grieved because of the

91
00:06:40,726 --> 00:06:44,726
 hardness of their hearts I cried unto the Lord for

92
00:06:44,726 --> 00:06:48,726
 them

93
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:50,675
19 And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto

94
00:06:50,675 --> 00:06:52,675
 me, saying: Blessed art thou, Nephi, because of thy

95
00:06:52,675 --> 00:06:54,675
 faith, for thou hast sought me diligently, with

96
00:06:54,675 --> 00:06:56,675
 lowliness of heart

97
00:06:56,65 --> 00:06:58,25
20 And inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments,

98
00:06:58,25 --> 00:06:59,85
 ye shall prosper, and shall be led to a land of

99
00:06:59,85 --> 00:07:01,45
 promise; yea, even a land which I have prepared for

100
00:07:01,45 --> 00:07:03,05
 you; yea, a land which is choice above all other

101
00:07:03,05 --> 00:07:04,65
 lands

102
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:09,957
21 And inasmuch as thy brethren shall rebel

103
00:07:09,957 --> 00:07:15,29
 against thee, they shall be cut off from the presence of

104
00:07:15,29 --> 00:07:20,623
 the Lord

105
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:23,24
22 And inasmuch as thou shalt keep my

106
00:07:23,24 --> 00:07:25,907
 commandments, thou shalt be made a ruler and a teacher over

107
00:07:25,907 --> 00:07:28,574
 thy brethren

108
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,548
23 For behold, in that day that they shall rebel

109
00:07:30,548 --> 00:07:32,548
 against me, I will curse them even with a sore

110
00:07:32,548 --> 00:07:34,548
 curse, and they shall have no power over thy seed

111
00:07:34,548 --> 00:07:36,548
 except they shall rebel against me also

112
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:37,19
24 And if it so be that they rebel against me,

113
00:07:37,19 --> 00:07:37,857
 they shall be a scourge unto thy seed, to stir them

114
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:38,524
 up in the ways of remembrance.
