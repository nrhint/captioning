Chapter 2 Lehi takes his family into the wilderness by 

2
00:00:10,5 --> 00:00:21,0
the Red Sea—They leave their property—Lehi offers a sacrifice to 

3
00:00:21,0 --> 00:00:31,5
the Lord and teaches his sons to keep the commandments—Laman 

4
00:00:31,5 --> 00:00:42,0
and Lemuel murmur against their father—Nephi is obedient and prays 

5
00:00:42,0 --> 00:00:52,5
in faith; the Lord speaks to him, and he is 

6
00:00:52,5 --> 00:01:03,0
chosen to rule over his brethren. About 600 B.C.  

7
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:06,464
1 For behold, it came to pass that the Lord 

8
00:01:06,464 --> 00:01:09,13
spake unto my father, yea, even in a dream, and 

9
00:01:09,13 --> 00:01:11,797
said unto him: Blessed art thou Lehi, because of the 

10
00:01:11,797 --> 00:01:14,464
things which thou hast done; and because thou hast been 

11
00:01:14,464 --> 00:01:17,13
faithful and declared unto this people the things which I 

12
00:01:17,13 --> 00:01:19,797
commanded thee, behold, they seek to take away thy life. 

13
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:25,08
2 And it came to pass that the Lord commanded 

14
00:01:25,08 --> 00:01:30,413
my father, even in a dream, that he should take 

15
00:01:30,413 --> 00:01:35,746
his family and depart into the wilderness. 

16
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:46,362
3 And it came to pass that he was obedient 

17
00:01:46,362 --> 00:01:57,029
unto the word of the Lord, wherefore he did as 

18
00:01:57,029 --> 00:02:07,696
the Lord commanded him. 

19
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:28,927
4 And it came to pass that he departed into 

20
00:02:28,927 --> 00:02:50,261
the wilderness. And he left his house, and the land 

21
00:02:50,261 --> 00:03:11,594
of his inheritance, and his gold, and his silver, and 

22
00:03:11,594 --> 00:03:32,927
his precious things, and took nothing with him, save it 

23
00:03:32,927 --> 00:03:54,261
were his family, and provisions, and tents, and departed into 

24
00:03:54,261 --> 00:04:15,594
the wilderness. 

25
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:25,688
5 And he came down by the borders near the 

26
00:04:25,688 --> 00:04:36,188
shore of the Red Sea; and he traveled in the 

27
00:04:36,188 --> 00:04:46,688
wilderness in the borders which are nearer the Red Sea; 

28
00:04:46,688 --> 00:04:57,188
and he did travel in the wilderness with his family, 

29
00:04:57,188 --> 00:05:07,688
which consisted of my mother, Sariah, and my elder brothers, 

30
00:05:07,688 --> 00:05:18,188
who were Laman, Lemuel, and Sam. 

31
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,985
6 And it came to pass that when he had 

32
00:05:20,985 --> 00:05:22,985
traveled three days in the wilderness, he pitched his tent 

33
00:05:22,985 --> 00:05:24,985
in a valley by the side of a river of 

34
00:05:24,985 --> 00:05:26,985
water. 

35
00:05:26,96 --> 00:05:32,293
7 And it came to pass that he built an 

36
00:05:32,293 --> 00:05:37,627
altar of stones, and made an offering unto the Lord, 

37
00:05:37,627 --> 00:05:42,96
and gave thanks unto the Lord our God. 

38
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,909
8 And it came to pass that he called the 

39
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:46,909
name of the river, Laman, and it emptied into the 

40
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:48,909
Red Sea; and the valley was in the borders near 

41
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:50,909
the mouth thereof. 

42
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:52,484
9 And when my father saw that the waters of 

43
00:05:52,484 --> 00:05:54,084
the river emptied into the fountain of the Red Sea, 

44
00:05:54,084 --> 00:05:55,684
he spake unto Laman, saying: O that thou mightest be 

45
00:05:55,684 --> 00:05:57,284
like unto this river, continually running into the fountain of 

46
00:05:57,284 --> 00:05:58,884
all righteousness! 

47
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,525
10 And he also spake unto Lemuel: O that thou 

48
00:06:01,525 --> 00:06:04,192
mightest be like unto this valley, firm and steadfast, and 

49
00:06:04,192 --> 00:06:06,858
immovable in keeping the commandments of the Lord! 

50
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:07,833
11 Now this he spake because of the stiffneckedness of 

51
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:08,833
Laman and Lemuel; for behold they did murmur in many 

52
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:09,833
things against their father, because he was a visionary man, 

53
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:10,833
and had led them out of the land of Jerusalem, 

54
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:11,833
to leave the land of their inheritance, and their gold, 

55
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:12,833
and their silver, and their precious things, to perish in 

56
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:13,833
the wilderness. And this they said he had done because 

57
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:14,833
of the foolish imaginations of his heart. 

58
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:18,808
12 And thus Laman and Lemuel, being the eldest, did 

59
00:06:18,808 --> 00:06:22,808
murmur against their father. And they did murmur because they 

60
00:06:22,808 --> 00:06:26,808
knew not the dealings of that God who had created 

61
00:06:26,808 --> 00:06:30,808
them. 

62
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:33,957
13 Neither did they believe that Jerusalem, that great city, 

63
00:06:33,957 --> 00:06:37,157
could be destroyed according to the words of the prophets. 

64
00:06:37,157 --> 00:06:40,357
And they were like unto the Jews who were at 

65
00:06:40,357 --> 00:06:43,557
Jerusalem, who sought to take away the life of my 

66
00:06:43,557 --> 00:06:46,757
father. 

67
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,04
14 And it came to pass that my father did 

68
00:06:48,04 --> 00:06:49,373
speak unto them in the valley of Lemuel, with power, 

69
00:06:49,373 --> 00:06:50,706
being filled with the Spirit, until their frames did shake 

70
00:06:50,706 --> 00:06:52,04
before him. And he did confound them, that they durst 

71
00:06:52,04 --> 00:06:53,373
not utter against him; wherefore, they did as he commanded 

72
00:06:53,373 --> 00:06:54,706
them. 

73
00:06:54,681 --> 00:07:02,681
15 And my father dwelt in a tent. 

74
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:03,656
16 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, being 

75
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:04,656
exceedingly young, nevertheless being large in stature, and also having 

76
00:07:04,656 --> 00:07:05,656
great desires to know of the mysteries of God, wherefore, 

77
00:07:05,656 --> 00:07:06,656
I did cry unto the Lord; and behold he did 

78
00:07:06,656 --> 00:07:07,656
visit me, and did soften my heart that I did 

79
00:07:07,656 --> 00:07:08,656
believe all the words which had been spoken by my 

80
00:07:08,656 --> 00:07:09,656
father; wherefore, I did not rebel against him like unto 

81
00:07:09,656 --> 00:07:10,656
my brothers. 

82
00:07:10,63 --> 00:07:12,63
17 And I spake unto Sam, making known unto him 

83
00:07:12,63 --> 00:07:14,63
the things which the Lord had manifested unto me by 

84
00:07:14,63 --> 00:07:16,63
his Holy Spirit. And it came to pass that he 

85
00:07:16,63 --> 00:07:18,63
believed in my words. 

86
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:21,272
18 But, behold, Laman and Lemuel would not hearken unto 

87
00:07:21,272 --> 00:07:23,938
my words; and being grieved because of the hardness of 

88
00:07:23,938 --> 00:07:26,605
their hearts I cried unto the Lord for them. 

89
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,579
19 And it came to pass that the Lord spake 

90
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:30,579
unto me, saying: Blessed art thou, Nephi, because of thy 

91
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:32,579
faith, for thou hast sought me diligently, with lowliness of 

92
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:34,579
heart. 

93
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:36,154
20 And inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye 

94
00:07:36,154 --> 00:07:37,754
shall prosper, and shall be led to a land of 

95
00:07:37,754 --> 00:07:39,354
promise; yea, even a land which I have prepared for 

96
00:07:39,354 --> 00:07:40,954
you; yea, a land which is choice above all other 

97
00:07:40,954 --> 00:07:42,554
lands. 

98
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:45,195
21 And inasmuch as thy brethren shall rebel against thee, 

99
00:07:45,195 --> 00:07:47,862
they shall be cut off from the presence of the 

100
00:07:47,862 --> 00:07:50,529
Lord. 

101
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:53,17
22 And inasmuch as thou shalt keep my commandments, thou 

102
00:07:53,17 --> 00:07:55,837
shalt be made a ruler and a teacher over thy 

103
00:07:55,837 --> 00:07:58,503
brethren. 

104
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,478
23 For behold, in that day that they shall rebel 

105
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:02,478
against me, I will curse them even with a sore 

106
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:04,478
curse, and they shall have no power over thy seed 

107
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:06,478
except they shall rebel against me also. 

108
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:06,453
24 And if it so be that they rebel against 

109
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:06,453
me, they shall be a scourge unto thy seed, to 

110
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:06,453
stir them up in the ways of remembrance.
