Chapter 2 Lehi takes his family into the wilderness by 

2
00:00:10,0 --> 00:00:20,0
the Red Sea—They leave their property—Lehi offers a sacrifice to 

3
00:00:20,0 --> 00:00:30,0
the Lord and teaches his sons to keep the commandments—Laman 

4
00:00:30,0 --> 00:00:40,0
and Lemuel murmur against their father—Nephi is obedient and prays 

5
00:00:40,0 --> 00:00:50,0
in faith; the Lord speaks to him, and he is 

6
00:00:50,0 --> 00:01:00,894
chosen to rule over his brethren. About 600 B.C.  

7
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,227
1 For behold, it came to pass that the Lord 

8
00:01:02,227 --> 00:01:03,56
spake unto my father, yea, even in a dream, and 

9
00:01:03,56 --> 00:01:04,893
said unto him: Blessed art thou Lehi, because of the 

10
00:01:04,893 --> 00:01:06,226
things which thou hast done; and because thou hast been 

11
00:01:06,226 --> 00:01:07,559
faithful and declared unto this people the things which I 

12
00:01:07,559 --> 00:01:08,869
commanded thee, behold, they seek to take away thy life. 

13
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:14,202
2 And it came to pass that the Lord commanded 

14
00:01:14,202 --> 00:01:19,535
my father, even in a dream, that he should take 

15
00:01:19,535 --> 00:01:24,818
his family and depart into the wilderness. 

16
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:30,151
3 And it came to pass that he was obedient 

17
00:01:30,151 --> 00:01:35,484
unto the word of the Lord, wherefore he did as 

18
00:01:35,484 --> 00:01:40,767
the Lord commanded him. 

19
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,434
4 And it came to pass that he departed into 

20
00:01:43,434 --> 00:01:46,101
the wilderness. And he left his house, and the land 

21
00:01:46,101 --> 00:01:48,768
of his inheritance, and his gold, and his silver, and 

22
00:01:48,768 --> 00:01:51,435
his precious things, and took nothing with him, save it 

23
00:01:51,435 --> 00:01:54,102
were his family, and provisions, and tents, and departed into 

24
00:01:54,102 --> 00:01:56,717
the wilderness. 

25
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:59,384
5 And he came down by the borders near the 

26
00:01:59,384 --> 00:02:02,051
shore of the Red Sea; and he traveled in the 

27
00:02:02,051 --> 00:02:04,718
wilderness in the borders which are nearer the Red Sea; 

28
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:07,385
and he did travel in the wilderness with his family, 

29
00:02:07,385 --> 00:02:10,052
which consisted of my mother, Sariah, and my elder brothers, 

30
00:02:10,052 --> 00:02:12,666
who were Laman, Lemuel, and Sam. 

31
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:34,666
6 And it came to pass that when he had 

32
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:56,666
traveled three days in the wilderness, he pitched his tent 

33
00:02:56,666 --> 00:03:18,666
in a valley by the side of a river of 

34
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:40,387
water. 

35
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:52,387
7 And it came to pass that he built an 

36
00:03:52,387 --> 00:04:04,387
altar of stones, and made an offering unto the Lord, 

37
00:04:04,387 --> 00:04:16,656
and gave thanks unto the Lord our God. 

38
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:34,656
8 And it came to pass that he called the 

39
00:04:34,656 --> 00:04:52,656
name of the river, Laman, and it emptied into the 

40
00:04:52,656 --> 00:05:10,656
Red Sea; and the valley was in the borders near 

41
00:05:10,656 --> 00:05:28,428
the mouth thereof. 

42
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:28,628
9 And when my father saw that the waters of 

43
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:28,828
the river emptied into the fountain of the Red Sea, 

44
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:29,028
he spake unto Laman, saying: O that thou mightest be 

45
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:29,228
like unto this river, continually running into the fountain of 

46
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:29,095
all righteousness! 

47
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:31,428
10 And he also spake unto Lemuel: O that thou 

48
00:05:31,428 --> 00:05:33,761
mightest be like unto this valley, firm and steadfast, and 

49
00:05:33,761 --> 00:05:36,136
immovable in keeping the commandments of the Lord! 

50
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:37,136
11 Now this he spake because of the stiffneckedness of 

51
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:38,136
Laman and Lemuel; for behold they did murmur in many 

52
00:05:38,136 --> 00:05:39,136
things against their father, because he was a visionary man, 

53
00:05:39,136 --> 00:05:40,136
and had led them out of the land of Jerusalem, 

54
00:05:40,136 --> 00:05:41,136
to leave the land of their inheritance, and their gold, 

55
00:05:41,136 --> 00:05:42,136
and their silver, and their precious things, to perish in 

56
00:05:42,136 --> 00:05:43,136
the wilderness. And this they said he had done because 

57
00:05:43,136 --> 00:05:44,11
of the foolish imaginations of his heart. 

58
00:05:44,11 --> 00:05:48,11
12 And thus Laman and Lemuel, being the eldest, did 

59
00:05:48,11 --> 00:05:52,11
murmur against their father. And they did murmur because they 

60
00:05:52,11 --> 00:05:56,11
knew not the dealings of that God who had created 

61
00:05:56,11 --> 00:06:00,06
them. 

62
00:06:00,06 --> 00:06:01,66
13 Neither did they believe that Jerusalem, that great city, 

63
00:06:01,66 --> 00:06:03,26
could be destroyed according to the words of the prophets. 

64
00:06:03,26 --> 00:06:04,86
And they were like unto the Jews who were at 

65
00:06:04,86 --> 00:06:06,46
Jerusalem, who sought to take away the life of my 

66
00:06:06,46 --> 00:06:08,034
father. 

67
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,367
14 And it came to pass that my father did 

68
00:06:09,367 --> 00:06:10,7
speak unto them in the valley of Lemuel, with power, 

69
00:06:10,7 --> 00:06:12,033
being filled with the Spirit, until their frames did shake 

70
00:06:12,033 --> 00:06:13,366
before him. And he did confound them, that they durst 

71
00:06:13,366 --> 00:06:14,699
not utter against him; wherefore, they did as he commanded 

72
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:16,009
them. 

73
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:23,984
15 And my father dwelt in a tent. 

74
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:24,109
16 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, being 

75
00:06:24,109 --> 00:06:24,234
exceedingly young, nevertheless being large in stature, and also having 

76
00:06:24,234 --> 00:06:24,359
great desires to know of the mysteries of God, wherefore, 

77
00:06:24,359 --> 00:06:24,484
I did cry unto the Lord; and behold he did 

78
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:24,609
visit me, and did soften my heart that I did 

79
00:06:24,609 --> 00:06:24,734
believe all the words which had been spoken by my 

80
00:06:24,734 --> 00:06:24,859
father; wherefore, I did not rebel against him like unto 

81
00:06:24,859 --> 00:06:24,751
my brothers. 

82
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,751
17 And I spake unto Sam, making known unto him 

83
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:28,751
the things which the Lord had manifested unto me by 

84
00:06:28,751 --> 00:06:30,751
his Holy Spirit. And it came to pass that he 

85
00:06:30,751 --> 00:06:32,726
believed in my words. 

86
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:38,059
18 But, behold, Laman and Lemuel would not hearken unto 

87
00:06:38,059 --> 00:06:43,392
my words; and being grieved because of the hardness of 

88
00:06:43,392 --> 00:06:48,675
their hearts I cried unto the Lord for them. 

89
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:50,675
19 And it came to pass that the Lord spake 

90
00:06:50,675 --> 00:06:52,675
unto me, saying: Blessed art thou, Nephi, because of thy 

91
00:06:52,675 --> 00:06:54,675
faith, for thou hast sought me diligently, with lowliness of 

92
00:06:54,675 --> 00:06:56,65
heart. 

93
00:06:56,65 --> 00:06:58,25
20 And inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye 

94
00:06:58,25 --> 00:06:59,85
shall prosper, and shall be led to a land of 

95
00:06:59,85 --> 00:07:01,45
promise; yea, even a land which I have prepared for 

96
00:07:01,45 --> 00:07:03,05
you; yea, a land which is choice above all other 

97
00:07:03,05 --> 00:07:04,624
lands. 

98
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:09,957
21 And inasmuch as thy brethren shall rebel against thee, 

99
00:07:09,957 --> 00:07:15,29
they shall be cut off from the presence of the 

100
00:07:15,29 --> 00:07:20,573
Lord. 

101
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:23,24
22 And inasmuch as thou shalt keep my commandments, thou 

102
00:07:23,24 --> 00:07:25,907
shalt be made a ruler and a teacher over thy 

103
00:07:25,907 --> 00:07:28,548
brethren. 

104
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,548
23 For behold, in that day that they shall rebel 

105
00:07:30,548 --> 00:07:32,548
against me, I will curse them even with a sore 

106
00:07:32,548 --> 00:07:34,548
curse, and they shall have no power over thy seed 

107
00:07:34,548 --> 00:07:36,523
except they shall rebel against me also. 

108
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:37,19
24 And if it so be that they rebel against 

109
00:07:37,19 --> 00:07:37,857
me, they shall be a scourge unto thy seed, to 

110
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:38,591
stir them up in the ways of remembrance.
