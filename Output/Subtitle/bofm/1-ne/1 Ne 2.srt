Chapter 2 Lehi takes his family into the wilderness by 

2
00:00:10,0 --> 00:00:20,0
the Red Sea—They leave their property—Lehi offers a sacrifice to 

3
00:00:20,0 --> 00:00:30,0
the Lord and teaches his sons to keep the commandments—Laman 

4
00:00:30,0 --> 00:00:40,0
and Lemuel murmur against their father—Nephi is obedient and prays 

5
00:00:40,0 --> 00:00:50,0
in faith; the Lord speaks to him, and he is 

6
00:00:50,0 --> 00:01:00,0
chosen to rule over his brethren. About 600 B.C.  

7
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,228
1 For behold, it came to pass that the Lord 

8
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,561
spake unto my father, yea, even in a dream, and 

9
00:01:03,561 --> 00:01:04,894
said unto him: Blessed art thou Lehi, because of the 

10
00:01:04,894 --> 00:01:06,228
things which thou hast done; and because thou hast been 

11
00:01:06,228 --> 00:01:07,561
faithful and declared unto this people the things which I 

12
00:01:07,561 --> 00:01:08,894
commanded thee, behold, they seek to take away thy life. 

13
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:14,202
2 And it came to pass that the Lord commanded 

14
00:01:14,202 --> 00:01:19,535
my father, even in a dream, that he should take 

15
00:01:19,535 --> 00:01:24,869
his family and depart into the wilderness. 

16
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:30,151
3 And it came to pass that he was obedient 

17
00:01:30,151 --> 00:01:35,485
unto the word of the Lord, wherefore he did as 

18
00:01:35,485 --> 00:01:40,818
the Lord commanded him. 

19
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,434
4 And it came to pass that he departed into 

20
00:01:43,434 --> 00:01:46,101
the wilderness. And he left his house, and the land 

21
00:01:46,101 --> 00:01:48,767
of his inheritance, and his gold, and his silver, and 

22
00:01:48,767 --> 00:01:51,434
his precious things, and took nothing with him, save it 

23
00:01:51,434 --> 00:01:54,101
were his family, and provisions, and tents, and departed into 

24
00:01:54,101 --> 00:01:56,767
the wilderness. 

25
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:59,383
5 And he came down by the borders near the 

26
00:01:59,383 --> 00:02:02,05
shore of the Red Sea; and he traveled in the 

27
00:02:02,05 --> 00:02:04,717
wilderness in the borders which are nearer the Red Sea; 

28
00:02:04,717 --> 00:02:07,383
and he did travel in the wilderness with his family, 

29
00:02:07,383 --> 00:02:10,05
which consisted of my mother, Sariah, and my elder brothers, 

30
00:02:10,05 --> 00:02:12,717
who were Laman, Lemuel, and Sam. 

31
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:34,666
6 And it came to pass that when he had 

32
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:56,666
traveled three days in the wilderness, he pitched his tent 

33
00:02:56,666 --> 00:03:18,666
in a valley by the side of a river of 

34
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:40,666
water. 

35
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:52,72
7 And it came to pass that he built an 

36
00:03:52,72 --> 00:04:05,054
altar of stones, and made an offering unto the Lord, 

37
00:04:05,054 --> 00:04:17,387
and gave thanks unto the Lord our God. 

38
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:24,857
8 And it came to pass that he called the 

39
00:04:24,857 --> 00:04:32,357
name of the river, Laman, and it emptied into the 

40
00:04:32,357 --> 00:04:39,857
Red Sea; and the valley was in the borders near 

41
00:04:39,857 --> 00:04:47,357
the mouth thereof. 

42
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:53,354
9 And when my father saw that the waters of 

43
00:04:53,354 --> 00:04:58,954
the river emptied into the fountain of the Red Sea, 

44
00:04:58,954 --> 00:05:04,554
he spake unto Laman, saying: O that thou mightest be 

45
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:10,154
like unto this river, continually running into the fountain of 

46
00:05:10,154 --> 00:05:15,754
all righteousness! 

47
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:22,215
10 And he also spake unto Lemuel: O that thou 

48
00:05:22,215 --> 00:05:29,215
mightest be like unto this valley, firm and steadfast, and 

49
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:36,215
immovable in keeping the commandments of the Lord! 

50
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:37,703
11 Now this he spake because of the stiffneckedness of 

51
00:05:37,703 --> 00:05:38,703
Laman and Lemuel; for behold they did murmur in many 

52
00:05:38,703 --> 00:05:39,703
things against their father, because he was a visionary man, 

53
00:05:39,703 --> 00:05:40,703
and had led them out of the land of Jerusalem, 

54
00:05:40,703 --> 00:05:41,703
to leave the land of their inheritance, and their gold, 

55
00:05:41,703 --> 00:05:42,703
and their silver, and their precious things, to perish in 

56
00:05:42,703 --> 00:05:43,703
the wilderness. And this they said he had done because 

57
00:05:43,703 --> 00:05:44,703
of the foolish imaginations of his heart. 

58
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:48,678
12 And thus Laman and Lemuel, being the eldest, did 

59
00:05:48,678 --> 00:05:52,678
murmur against their father. And they did murmur because they 

60
00:05:52,678 --> 00:05:56,678
knew not the dealings of that God who had created 

61
00:05:56,678 --> 00:06:00,678
them. 

62
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:03,827
13 Neither did they believe that Jerusalem, that great city, 

63
00:06:03,827 --> 00:06:07,027
could be destroyed according to the words of the prophets. 

64
00:06:07,027 --> 00:06:10,227
And they were like unto the Jews who were at 

65
00:06:10,227 --> 00:06:13,427
Jerusalem, who sought to take away the life of my 

66
00:06:13,427 --> 00:06:16,627
father. 

67
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:17,91
14 And it came to pass that my father did 

68
00:06:17,91 --> 00:06:19,243
speak unto them in the valley of Lemuel, with power, 

69
00:06:19,243 --> 00:06:20,576
being filled with the Spirit, until their frames did shake 

70
00:06:20,576 --> 00:06:21,91
before him. And he did confound them, that they durst 

71
00:06:21,91 --> 00:06:23,243
not utter against him; wherefore, they did as he commanded 

72
00:06:23,243 --> 00:06:24,576
them. 

73
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:32,551
15 And my father dwelt in a tent. 

74
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:33,525
16 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, being 

75
00:06:33,525 --> 00:06:34,525
exceedingly young, nevertheless being large in stature, and also having 

76
00:06:34,525 --> 00:06:35,525
great desires to know of the mysteries of God, wherefore, 

77
00:06:35,525 --> 00:06:36,525
I did cry unto the Lord; and behold he did 

78
00:06:36,525 --> 00:06:37,525
visit me, and did soften my heart that I did 

79
00:06:37,525 --> 00:06:38,525
believe all the words which had been spoken by my 

80
00:06:38,525 --> 00:06:39,525
father; wherefore, I did not rebel against him like unto 

81
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:40,525
my brothers. 

82
00:06:40,5 --> 00:06:42,5
17 And I spake unto Sam, making known unto him 

83
00:06:42,5 --> 00:06:44,5
the things which the Lord had manifested unto me by 

84
00:06:44,5 --> 00:06:46,5
his Holy Spirit. And it came to pass that he 

85
00:06:46,5 --> 00:06:48,5
believed in my words. 

86
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:51,141
18 But, behold, Laman and Lemuel would not hearken unto 

87
00:06:51,141 --> 00:06:53,808
my words; and being grieved because of the hardness of 

88
00:06:53,808 --> 00:06:56,475
their hearts I cried unto the Lord for them. 

89
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,449
19 And it came to pass that the Lord spake 

90
00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:00,449
unto me, saying: Blessed art thou, Nephi, because of thy 

91
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:02,449
faith, for thou hast sought me diligently, with lowliness of 

92
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:04,449
heart. 

93
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,024
20 And inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye 

94
00:07:06,024 --> 00:07:07,624
shall prosper, and shall be led to a land of 

95
00:07:07,624 --> 00:07:09,224
promise; yea, even a land which I have prepared for 

96
00:07:09,224 --> 00:07:10,824
you; yea, a land which is choice above all other 

97
00:07:10,824 --> 00:07:12,424
lands. 

98
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:15,065
21 And inasmuch as thy brethren shall rebel against thee, 

99
00:07:15,065 --> 00:07:17,732
they shall be cut off from the presence of the 

100
00:07:17,732 --> 00:07:20,399
Lord. 

101
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:23,04
22 And inasmuch as thou shalt keep my commandments, thou 

102
00:07:23,04 --> 00:07:25,707
shalt be made a ruler and a teacher over thy 

103
00:07:25,707 --> 00:07:28,373
brethren. 

104
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:30,348
23 For behold, in that day that they shall rebel 

105
00:07:30,348 --> 00:07:32,348
against me, I will curse them even with a sore 

106
00:07:32,348 --> 00:07:34,348
curse, and they shall have no power over thy seed 

107
00:07:34,348 --> 00:07:36,348
except they shall rebel against me also. 

108
00:07:36,323 --> 00:09:03,323
24 And if it so be that they rebel against 

109
00:09:03,323 --> 00:10:30,323
me, they shall be a scourge unto thy seed, to 

110
00:10:30,323 --> 00:11:57,323
stir them up in the ways of remembrance.
