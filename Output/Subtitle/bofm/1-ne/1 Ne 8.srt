00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:18,5
Chapter 8 Lehi sees a vision of the tree of

2
00:00:18,5 --> 00:00:37,0
 life—He partakes of its fruit and desires his family to

3
00:00:37,0 --> 00:00:55,5
 do likewise—He sees a rod of iron, a strait and

4
00:00:55,5 --> 00:01:14,0
 narrow path, and the mists of darkness that enshroud

5
00:01:14,0 --> 00:01:32,5
 men—Sariah, Nephi, and Sam partake of the fruit,

6
00:01:32,5 --> 00:01:51,0
 but Laman and Lemuel refuse. About 600–592 B.C.

7
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:57,645
1 And it came to pass that we had gathered

8
00:01:57,645 --> 00:02:03,645
 together all manner of seeds of every kind, both of grain

9
00:02:03,645 --> 00:02:09,645
 of every kind, and also of the seeds of fruit of

10
00:02:09,645 --> 00:02:15,645
 every kind

11
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:37,569
2 And it came to pass that while my father tarried

12
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:59,569
 in the wilderness he spake unto us, saying:

13
00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:21,569
 Behold, I have dreamed a dream; or, in other words, I

14
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:43,569
 have seen a vision

15
00:03:43,29 --> 00:03:46,49
3 And behold, because of the thing which I have

16
00:03:46,49 --> 00:03:49,69
 seen, I have reason to rejoice in the Lord because

17
00:03:49,69 --> 00:03:52,89
 of Nephi and also of Sam; for I have reason to

18
00:03:52,89 --> 00:03:56,09
 suppose that they, and also many of their seed, will

19
00:03:56,09 --> 00:03:59,29
 be saved

20
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:07,239
4 But behold, Laman and Lemuel, I fear exceedingly

21
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:15,239
 because of you; for behold, methought I saw in my

22
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:23,239
 dream, a dark and dreary wilderness

23
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:25,83
5 And it came to pass that I saw a man, and he was

24
00:04:25,83 --> 00:04:28,497
 dressed in a white robe; and he came and stood

25
00:04:28,497 --> 00:04:31,164
 before me

26
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:39,138
6 And it came to pass that he spake unto me, and

27
00:04:39,138 --> 00:04:47,138
 bade me follow him

28
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:55,087
7 And it came to pass that as I followed him I

29
00:04:55,087 --> 00:05:03,087
 beheld myself that I was in a dark and dreary waste

30
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:10,786
8 And after I had traveled for the space of many

31
00:05:10,786 --> 00:05:18,536
 hours in darkness, I began to pray unto the Lord

32
00:05:18,536 --> 00:05:26,286
 that he would have mercy on me, according to the

33
00:05:26,286 --> 00:05:34,036
 multitude of his tender mercies

34
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:42,935
9 And it came to pass after I had prayed unto the

35
00:05:42,935 --> 00:05:50,935
 Lord I beheld a large and spacious field

36
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:54,884
10 And it came to pass that I beheld a tree, whose

37
00:05:54,884 --> 00:05:58,884
 fruit was desirable to make one happy

38
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,192
11 And it came to pass that I did go forth and

39
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:01,524
 partake of the fruit thereof; and I beheld that it

40
00:06:01,524 --> 00:06:02,858
 was most sweet, above all that I ever before tasted.

41
00:06:02,858 --> 00:06:04,19
 Yea, and I beheld that the fruit thereof was

42
00:06:04,19 --> 00:06:05,524
 white, to exceed all the whiteness that I had ever

43
00:06:05,524 --> 00:06:06,856
 seen

44
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,433
12 And as I partook of the fruit thereof it filled

45
00:06:08,433 --> 00:06:10,033
 my soul with exceedingly great joy; wherefore, I

46
00:06:10,033 --> 00:06:11,633
 began to be desirous that my family should partake

47
00:06:11,633 --> 00:06:13,233
 of it also; for I knew that it was desirable

48
00:06:13,233 --> 00:06:14,833
 above all other fruit

49
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:15,058
13 And as I cast my eyes round about, that perhaps

50
00:06:15,058 --> 00:06:15,308
 I might discover my family also, I beheld a river

51
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:15,558
 of water; and it ran along, and it was near the

52
00:06:15,558 --> 00:06:15,808
 tree of which I was partaking the fruit

53
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:17,209
14 And I looked to behold from whence it came; and

54
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:18,809
 I saw the head thereof a little way off; and at

55
00:06:18,809 --> 00:06:20,409
 the head thereof I beheld your mother Sariah, and

56
00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:22,009
 Sam, and Nephi; and they stood as if they knew not

57
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:23,609
 whither they should go

58
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:30,283
15 And it came to pass that I beckoned unto them;

59
00:06:30,283 --> 00:06:36,783
 and I also did say unto them with a loud voice

60
00:06:36,783 --> 00:06:43,283
 that they should come unto me, and partake of the

61
00:06:43,283 --> 00:06:49,783
 fruit, which was desirable above all other fruit

62
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:54,042
16 And it came to pass that they did come unto me

63
00:06:54,042 --> 00:06:58,542
 and partake of the fruit also

64
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:03,151
17 And it came to pass that I was desirous that

65
00:07:03,151 --> 00:07:08,151
 Laman and Lemuel should come and partake of the

66
00:07:08,151 --> 00:07:13,151
 fruit also; wherefore, I cast mine eyes towards the

67
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:18,151
 head of the river, that perhaps I might see them

68
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:24,905
18 And it came to pass that I saw them, but they

69
00:07:24,905 --> 00:07:30,905
 would not come unto me and partake of the fruit

70
00:07:30,25 --> 00:07:37,917
19 And I beheld a rod of iron, and it extended

71
00:07:37,917 --> 00:07:45,584
 along the bank of the river, and led to the tree by

72
00:07:45,584 --> 00:07:53,251
 which I stood

73
00:07:53,406 --> 00:08:00,806
20 And I also beheld a strait and narrow path,

74
00:08:00,806 --> 00:08:08,206
 which came along by the rod of iron, even to the tree

75
00:08:08,206 --> 00:08:15,606
 by which I stood; and it also led by the head of

76
00:08:15,606 --> 00:08:23,006
 the fountain, unto a large and spacious field, as

77
00:08:23,006 --> 00:08:30,406
 if it had been a world

78
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:36,093
21 And I saw numberless concourses of people, many

79
00:08:36,093 --> 00:08:41,843
 of whom were pressing forward, that they might

80
00:08:41,843 --> 00:08:47,593
 obtain the path which led unto the tree by which I

81
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:53,343
 stood

82
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:59,566
22 And it came to pass that they did come forth,

83
00:08:59,566 --> 00:09:05,566
 and commence in the path which led to the tree

84
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:10,945
23 And it came to pass that there arose a mist of

85
00:09:10,945 --> 00:09:16,145
 darkness; yea, even an exceedingly great mist of

86
00:09:16,145 --> 00:09:21,345
 darkness, insomuch that they who had commenced in

87
00:09:21,345 --> 00:09:26,545
 the path did lose their way, that they wandered off

88
00:09:26,545 --> 00:09:31,745
 and were lost

89
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:36,604
24 And it came to pass that I beheld others

90
00:09:36,604 --> 00:09:41,604
 pressing forward, and they came forth and caught hold of

91
00:09:41,604 --> 00:09:46,604
 the end of the rod of iron; and they did press

92
00:09:46,604 --> 00:09:51,604
 forward through the mist of darkness, clinging to

93
00:09:51,604 --> 00:09:56,604
 the rod of iron, even until they did come forth and

94
00:09:56,604 --> 00:10:01,604
 partake of the fruit of the tree

95
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:05,6
25 And after they had partaken of the fruit of the

96
00:10:05,6 --> 00:10:09,933
 tree they did cast their eyes about as if they

97
00:10:09,933 --> 00:10:14,266
 were ashamed

98
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:20,948
26 And I also cast my eyes round about, and

99
00:10:20,948 --> 00:10:26,948
 beheld, on the other side of the river of water, a great

100
00:10:26,948 --> 00:10:32,948
 and spacious building; and it stood as it were in

101
00:10:32,948 --> 00:10:38,948
 the air, high above the earth

102
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:43,838
27 And it was filled with people, both old and

103
00:10:43,838 --> 00:10:49,338
 young, both male and female; and their manner of

104
00:10:49,338 --> 00:10:54,838
 dress was exceedingly fine; and they were in the

105
00:10:54,838 --> 00:11:00,338
 attitude of mocking and pointing their fingers towards

106
00:11:00,338 --> 00:11:05,838
 those who had come at and were partaking of the

107
00:11:05,838 --> 00:11:11,338
 fruit

108
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:17,621
28 And after they had tasted of the fruit they

109
00:11:17,621 --> 00:11:23,371
 were ashamed, because of those that were scoffing at

110
00:11:23,371 --> 00:11:29,121
 them; and they fell away into forbidden paths and

111
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:34,871
 were lost

112
00:11:34,36 --> 00:11:41,36
29 And now I, Nephi, do not speak all the words of

113
00:11:41,36 --> 00:11:48,36
 my father

114
00:11:48,174 --> 00:12:04,007
30 But, to be short in writing, behold, he saw

115
00:12:04,007 --> 00:12:19,84
 other multitudes pressing forward; and they came and

116
00:12:19,84 --> 00:12:35,673
 caught hold of the end of the rod of iron; and

117
00:12:35,673 --> 00:12:51,506
 they did press their way forward, continually holding

118
00:12:51,506 --> 00:13:07,339
 fast to the rod of iron, until they came forth

119
00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:23,172
 and fell down and partook of the fruit of the tree

120
00:13:23,87 --> 00:13:31,87
31 And he also saw other multitudes feeling their

121
00:13:31,87 --> 00:13:39,87
 way towards that great and spacious building

122
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,486
32 And it came to pass that many were drowned in

123
00:13:42,486 --> 00:13:45,153
 the depths of the fountain; and many were lost from

124
00:13:45,153 --> 00:13:47,82
 his view, wandering in strange roads

125
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:50,994
33 And great was the multitude that did enter into

126
00:13:50,994 --> 00:13:54,194
 that strange building. And after they did enter

127
00:13:54,194 --> 00:13:57,394
 into that building they did point the finger of

128
00:13:57,394 --> 00:14:00,594
 scorn at me and those that were partaking of the

129
00:14:00,594 --> 00:14:03,794
 fruit also; but we heeded them not

130
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:15,743
34 These are the words of my father: For as many

131
00:14:15,743 --> 00:14:27,743
 as heeded them, had fallen away

132
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:39,667
35 And Laman and Lemuel partook not of the fruit,

133
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:51,667
 said my father

134
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:51,924
36 And it came to pass after my father had spoken

135
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:52,257
 all the words of his dream or vision, which were

136
00:14:52,257 --> 00:14:52,59
 many, he said unto us, because of these things

137
00:14:52,59 --> 00:14:52,923
 which he saw in a vision, he exceedingly feared for

138
00:14:52,923 --> 00:14:53,256
 Laman and Lemuel; yea, he feared lest they should be

139
00:14:53,256 --> 00:14:53,589
 cast off from the presence of the Lord

140
00:14:53,86 --> 00:14:57,26
37 And he did exhort them then with all the

141
00:14:57,26 --> 00:15:00,66
 feeling of a tender parent, that they would hearken to

142
00:15:00,66 --> 00:15:04,06
 his words, that perhaps the Lord would be merciful

143
00:15:04,06 --> 00:15:07,46
 to them, and not cast them off; yea, my father did

144
00:15:07,46 --> 00:15:10,86
 preach unto them

145
00:15:10,91 --> 00:15:12,66
38 And after he had preached unto them, and also

146
00:15:12,66 --> 00:15:14,41
 prophesied unto them of many things, he bade them

147
00:15:14,41 --> 00:15:16,16
 to keep the commandments of the Lord; and he did

148
00:15:16,16 --> 00:15:17,91
 cease speaking unto them.
