00:00:00,4 --> 00:00:08,543
Chapter 19 Nephi makes plates of ore and records

2
00:00:08,543 --> 00:00:16,686
 the history of his people—The God of Israel will

3
00:00:16,686 --> 00:00:24,829
 come six hundred years from the time Lehi left

4
00:00:24,829 --> 00:00:32,972
 Jerusalem—Nephi tells of His sufferings and

5
00:00:32,972 --> 00:00:41,115
 crucifixion—The Jews will be despised and scattered until the

6
00:00:41,115 --> 00:00:49,258
 latter days, when they will return unto the Lord.

7
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:57,401
 About 588–570 B.C.

8
00:00:57,658 --> 00:01:03,033
1 And it came to pass that the Lord commanded me,

9
00:01:03,033 --> 00:01:08,408
 wherefore I did make plates of ore that I might

10
00:01:08,408 --> 00:01:13,783
 engraven upon them the record of my people. And upon

11
00:01:13,783 --> 00:01:19,158
 the plates which I made I did engraven the record

12
00:01:19,158 --> 00:01:24,533
 of my father, and also our journeyings in the

13
00:01:24,533 --> 00:01:29,908
 wilderness, and the prophecies of my father; and also

14
00:01:29,908 --> 00:01:35,283
 many of mine own prophecies have I engraven upon

15
00:01:35,283 --> 00:01:40,658
 them

16
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:45,712
2 And I knew not at the time when I made them that

17
00:01:45,712 --> 00:01:50,823
 I should be commanded of the Lord to make these

18
00:01:50,823 --> 00:01:55,934
 plates; wherefore, the record of my father, and the

19
00:01:55,934 --> 00:02:01,045
 genealogy of his fathers, and the more part of

20
00:02:01,045 --> 00:02:06,156
 all our proceedings in the wilderness are engraven

21
00:02:06,156 --> 00:02:11,267
 upon those first plates of which I have spoken;

22
00:02:11,267 --> 00:02:16,377
 wherefore, the things which transpired before I made

23
00:02:16,377 --> 00:02:21,489
 these plates are, of a truth, more particularly

24
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:26,6
 made mention upon the first plates

25
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:31,757
3 And after I had made these plates by way of

26
00:02:31,757 --> 00:02:37,201
 commandment, I, Nephi, received a commandment that the

27
00:02:37,201 --> 00:02:42,645
 ministry and the prophecies, the more plain and

28
00:02:42,645 --> 00:02:48,089
 precious parts of them, should be written upon

29
00:02:48,089 --> 00:02:53,533
 these plates; and that the things which were written

30
00:02:53,533 --> 00:02:58,977
 should be kept for the instruction of my people,

31
00:02:58,977 --> 00:03:04,421
 who should possess the land, and also for other wise

32
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:09,865
 purposes, which purposes are known unto the Lord

33
00:03:09,865 --> 00:03:15,309


34
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:20,739
4 Wherefore, I, Nephi, did make a record upon the

35
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:26,183
 other plates, which gives an account, or which

36
00:03:26,183 --> 00:03:31,627
 gives a greater account of the wars and contentions

37
00:03:31,627 --> 00:03:37,071
 and destructions of my people. And this have I

38
00:03:37,071 --> 00:03:42,515
 done, and commanded my people what they should do

39
00:03:42,515 --> 00:03:47,959
 after I was gone; and that these plates should be

40
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:53,403
 handed down from one generation to another, or from

41
00:03:53,403 --> 00:03:58,847
 one prophet to another, until further commandments

42
00:03:58,847 --> 00:04:04,291
 of the Lord

43
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:10,145
5 And an account of my making these plates shall

44
00:04:10,145 --> 00:04:15,545
 be given hereafter; and then, behold, I proceed

45
00:04:15,545 --> 00:04:20,945
 according to that which I have spoken; and this I do

46
00:04:20,945 --> 00:04:26,345
 that the more sacred things may be kept for the

47
00:04:26,345 --> 00:04:31,745
 knowledge of my people

48
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:37,304
6 Nevertheless, I do not write anything upon

49
00:04:37,304 --> 00:04:43,304
 plates save it be that I think it be sacred. And now,

50
00:04:43,304 --> 00:04:49,304
 if I do err, even did they err of old; not that I

51
00:04:49,304 --> 00:04:55,304
 would excuse myself because of other men, but

52
00:04:55,304 --> 00:05:01,304
 because of the weakness which is in me, according to

53
00:05:01,304 --> 00:05:07,304
 the flesh, I would excuse myself

54
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:20,778
7 For the things which some men esteem to be of

55
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:34,349
 great worth, both to the body and soul, others set

56
00:05:34,349 --> 00:05:47,92
 at naught and trample under their feet. Yea, even

57
00:05:47,92 --> 00:06:01,491
 the very God of Israel do men trample under their

58
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:15,062
 feet; I say, trample under their feet but I would

59
00:06:15,062 --> 00:06:28,633
 speak in other words—they set him at naught, and

60
00:06:28,633 --> 00:06:42,204
 hearken not to the voice of his counsels

61
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:43,236
8 And behold he cometh, according to the words of

62
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:43,569
 the angel, in six hundred years from the time my

63
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:43,902
 father left Jerusalem

64
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:44,56
9 And the world, because of their iniquity, shall

65
00:06:44,56 --> 00:06:45,417
 judge him to be a thing of naught; wherefore they

66
00:06:45,417 --> 00:06:46,274
 scourge him, and he suffereth it; and they smite

67
00:06:46,274 --> 00:06:47,131
 him, and he suffereth it. Yea, they spit upon him,

68
00:06:47,131 --> 00:06:47,988
 and he suffereth it, because of his loving

69
00:06:47,988 --> 00:06:48,845
 kindness and his long-suffering towards the children of

70
00:06:48,845 --> 00:06:49,702
 men

71
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:55,976
10 And the God of our fathers, who were led out of

72
00:06:55,976 --> 00:07:02,476
 Egypt, out of bondage, and also were preserved in

73
00:07:02,476 --> 00:07:08,976
 the wilderness by him, yea, the God of Abraham,

74
00:07:08,976 --> 00:07:15,476
 and of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, yieldeth

75
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:21,976
 himself, according to the words of the angel, as a man,

76
00:07:21,976 --> 00:07:28,476
 into the hands of wicked men, to be lifted up,

77
00:07:28,476 --> 00:07:34,976
 according to the words of Zenock, and to be

78
00:07:34,976 --> 00:07:41,476
 crucified, according to the words of Neum, and to be buried

79
00:07:41,476 --> 00:07:47,976
 in a sepulchre, according to the words of Zenos,

80
00:07:47,976 --> 00:07:54,476
 which he spake concerning the three days of

81
00:07:54,476 --> 00:08:00,976
 darkness, which should be a sign given of his death unto

82
00:08:00,976 --> 00:08:07,476
 those who should inhabit the isles of the sea,

83
00:08:07,476 --> 00:08:13,976
 more especially given unto those who are of the

84
00:08:13,976 --> 00:08:20,476
 house of Israel

85
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:22,908
11 For thus spake the prophet: The Lord God surely

86
00:08:22,908 --> 00:08:25,783
 shall visit all the house of Israel at that day,

87
00:08:25,783 --> 00:08:28,658
 some with his voice, because of their

88
00:08:28,658 --> 00:08:31,533
 righteousness, unto their great joy and salvation, and others

89
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:34,408
 with the thunderings and the lightnings of his

90
00:08:34,408 --> 00:08:37,283
 power, by tempest, by fire, and by smoke, and vapor

91
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:40,158
 of darkness, and by the opening of the earth, and

92
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:43,033
 by mountains which shall be carried up

93
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:47,957
12 And all these things must surely come, saith

94
00:08:47,957 --> 00:08:51,957
 the prophet Zenos. And the rocks of the earth must

95
00:08:51,957 --> 00:08:55,957
 rend; and because of the groanings of the earth,

96
00:08:55,957 --> 00:08:59,957
 many of the kings of the isles of the sea shall be

97
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:03,957
 wrought upon by the Spirit of God, to exclaim: The

98
00:09:03,957 --> 00:09:07,957
 God of nature suffers

99
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,481
13 And as for those who are at Jerusalem, saith

100
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:11,081
 the prophet, they shall be scourged by all people,

101
00:09:11,081 --> 00:09:12,681
 because they crucify the God of Israel, and turn

102
00:09:12,681 --> 00:09:14,281
 their hearts aside, rejecting signs and wonders, and

103
00:09:14,281 --> 00:09:15,881
 the power and glory of the God of Israel

104
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,455
14 And because they turn their hearts aside, saith

105
00:09:17,455 --> 00:09:19,055
 the prophet, and have despised the Holy One of

106
00:09:19,055 --> 00:09:20,655
 Israel, they shall wander in the flesh, and perish,

107
00:09:20,655 --> 00:09:22,255
 and become a hiss and a byword, and be hated among

108
00:09:22,255 --> 00:09:23,855
 all nations

109
00:09:23,83 --> 00:09:25,83
15 Nevertheless, when that day cometh, saith the

110
00:09:25,83 --> 00:09:27,83
 prophet, that they no more turn aside their hearts

111
00:09:27,83 --> 00:09:29,83
 against the Holy One of Israel, then will he

112
00:09:29,83 --> 00:09:31,83
 remember the covenants which he made to their fathers

113
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:33,405
16 Yea, then will he remember the isles of the

114
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:35,005
 sea; yea, and all the people who are of the house of

115
00:09:35,005 --> 00:09:36,605
 Israel, will I gather in, saith the Lord,

116
00:09:36,605 --> 00:09:38,205
 according to the words of the prophet Zenos, from the four

117
00:09:38,205 --> 00:09:39,805
 quarters of the earth

118
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:45,112
17 Yea, and all the earth shall see the salvation

119
00:09:45,112 --> 00:09:50,445
 of the Lord, saith the prophet; every nation,

120
00:09:50,445 --> 00:09:55,778
 kindred, tongue and people shall be blessed

121
00:09:55,728 --> 00:10:01,061
18 And I, Nephi, have written these things unto my

122
00:10:01,061 --> 00:10:06,394
 people, that perhaps I might persuade them that

123
00:10:06,394 --> 00:10:11,727
 they would remember the Lord their Redeemer

124
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:14,345
19 Wherefore, I speak unto all the house of

125
00:10:14,345 --> 00:10:17,012
 Israel, if it so be that they should obtain these

126
00:10:17,012 --> 00:10:19,679
 things

127
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:20,985
20 For behold, I have workings in the spirit,

128
00:10:20,985 --> 00:10:22,318
 which doth weary me even that all my joints are weak,

129
00:10:22,318 --> 00:10:23,651
 for those who are at Jerusalem; for had not the

130
00:10:23,651 --> 00:10:24,984
 Lord been merciful, to show unto me concerning them,

131
00:10:24,984 --> 00:10:26,317
 even as he had prophets of old, I should have

132
00:10:26,317 --> 00:10:27,65
 perished also

133
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,827
21 And he surely did show unto the prophets of old

134
00:10:30,827 --> 00:10:34,027
 all things concerning them; and also he did show

135
00:10:34,027 --> 00:10:37,227
 unto many concerning us; wherefore, it must needs

136
00:10:37,227 --> 00:10:40,427
 be that we know concerning them for they are

137
00:10:40,427 --> 00:10:43,627
 written upon the plates of brass

138
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:46,243
22 Now it came to pass that I, Nephi, did teach my

139
00:10:46,243 --> 00:10:48,91
 brethren these things; and it came to pass that I

140
00:10:48,91 --> 00:10:51,577
 did read many things to them, which were engraven

141
00:10:51,577 --> 00:10:54,244
 upon the plates of brass, that they might know

142
00:10:54,244 --> 00:10:56,911
 concerning the doings of the Lord in other lands,

143
00:10:56,911 --> 00:10:59,578
 among people of old

144
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:07,526
23 And I did read many things unto them which were

145
00:11:07,526 --> 00:11:15,526
 written in the books of Moses; but that I might

146
00:11:15,526 --> 00:11:23,526
 more fully persuade them to believe in the Lord

147
00:11:23,526 --> 00:11:31,526
 their Redeemer I did read unto them that which was

148
00:11:31,526 --> 00:11:39,526
 written by the prophet Isaiah; for I did liken all

149
00:11:39,526 --> 00:11:47,526
 scriptures unto us, that it might be for our profit

150
00:11:47,526 --> 00:11:55,526
 and learning

151
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:55,348
24 Wherefore I spake unto them, saying: Hear ye

152
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:55,348
 the words of the prophet, ye who are a remnant of

153
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:55,348
 the house of Israel, a branch who have been broken

154
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:55,348
 off; hear ye the words of the prophet, which were

155
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:55,348
 written unto all the house of Israel, and liken

156
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:55,348
 them unto yourselves, that ye may have hope as well

157
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:55,348
 as your brethren from whom ye have been broken off;

158
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:55,348
 for after this manner has the prophet written.
