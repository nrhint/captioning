00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:37,931
Chapter 5 Sariah complains against Lehi—Both

2
00:00:37,931 --> 00:00:44,931
 rejoice over the return of their sons—They

3
00:00:44,931 --> 00:00:51,931
 offer sacrifices—The plates of brass contain

4
00:00:51,931 --> 00:00:58,931
 writings of Moses and the prophets—The

5
00:00:58,931 --> 00:01:05,931
 plates identify Lehi as a descendant of

6
00:01:05,931 --> 00:01:12,931
 Joseph—Lehi prophesies concerning his seed and the

7
00:01:12,931 --> 00:01:19,931
 preservation of the plates. About

8
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:23,946
1 And it came to pass that after we had

9
00:01:23,946 --> 00:01:28,146
 come down into the wilderness unto our

10
00:01:28,146 --> 00:01:32,346
 father, behold, he was filled with joy, and

11
00:01:32,346 --> 00:01:36,546
 also my mother, Sariah, was exceedingly

12
00:01:36,546 --> 00:01:40,746
 glad, for she truly had mourned because of

13
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:51,153
2 For she had supposed that we had

14
00:01:51,153 --> 00:02:01,439
 perished in the wilderness; and she also had

15
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:11,725
 complained against my father, telling

16
00:02:11,725 --> 00:02:22,011
 him that he was a visionary man; saying:

17
00:02:22,011 --> 00:02:32,297
 Behold thou hast led us forth from the

18
00:02:32,297 --> 00:02:42,583
 land of our inheritance, and my sons are

19
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:52,869
 no more, and we perish in the wilderness

20
00:02:52,639 --> 00:03:24,639
3 And after this manner of language had

21
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:56,639
 my mother complained against my

22
00:03:56,436 --> 00:04:01,007
4 And it had come to pass that my

23
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:05,578
 father spake unto her, saying: I know

24
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:10,149
 that I am a visionary man; for if I had

25
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:14,72
 not seen the things of God in a

26
00:04:14,72 --> 00:04:19,291
 vision I should not have known the

27
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:23,862
 goodness of God, but had tarried at

28
00:04:23,862 --> 00:04:28,433
 Jerusalem, and had perished with my

29
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:45,668
5 But behold, I have obtained a

30
00:04:45,668 --> 00:05:03,001
 land of promise, in the which things I

31
00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:20,334
 do rejoice; yea, and I know that

32
00:05:20,334 --> 00:05:37,667
 the Lord will deliver my sons out of

33
00:05:37,667 --> 00:05:54,0
 the hands of Laban, and bring them

34
00:05:54,0 --> 00:06:12,333
 down again unto us in the

35
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:14,505
6 And after this manner of

36
00:06:14,505 --> 00:06:17,005
 language did my father, Lehi, comfort

37
00:06:17,005 --> 00:06:19,505
 my mother, Sariah, concerning us,

38
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:22,005
 while we journeyed in the

39
00:06:22,005 --> 00:06:24,505
 wilderness up to the land of Jerusalem,

40
00:06:24,505 --> 00:06:27,005
 to obtain the record of the Jews

41
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:29,954
7 And when we had returned

42
00:06:29,954 --> 00:06:31,954
 to the tent of my father,

43
00:06:31,954 --> 00:06:33,954
 behold their joy was full,

44
00:06:33,954 --> 00:06:35,954
 and my mother was comforted

45
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:37,529
8 And she spake, saying:

46
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:39,129
 Now I know of a surety

47
00:06:39,129 --> 00:06:40,729
 that the Lord hath

48
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:42,329
 commanded my husband to flee into

49
00:06:42,329 --> 00:06:43,929
 the wilderness; yea, and

50
00:06:43,929 --> 00:06:45,529
 I also know of a surety

51
00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:47,129
 that the Lord hath

52
00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:48,729
 protected my sons, and

53
00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:50,329
 delivered them out of the hands

54
00:06:50,329 --> 00:06:51,929
 of Laban, and given them

55
00:06:51,929 --> 00:06:53,529
 power whereby they could

56
00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:55,129
 accomplish the thing which

57
00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:56,729
 the Lord hath commanded

58
00:06:56,729 --> 00:06:58,329
 them. And after this

59
00:06:58,329 --> 00:06:59,929
 manner of language did she

60
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:03,282
9 And it came to pass

61
00:07:03,282 --> 00:07:06,711
 that they did rejoice

62
00:07:06,711 --> 00:07:10,14
 exceedingly, and did

63
00:07:10,14 --> 00:07:13,569
 offer sacrifice and

64
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:16,998
 burnt offerings unto the

65
00:07:16,998 --> 00:07:20,427
 Lord; and they gave

66
00:07:20,427 --> 00:07:23,856
 thanks unto the God of

67
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:24,666
10 And after they

68
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:25,555
 had given thanks unto

69
00:07:25,555 --> 00:07:26,444
 the God of Israel,

70
00:07:26,444 --> 00:07:27,333
 my father, Lehi, took

71
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:28,222
 the records which

72
00:07:28,222 --> 00:07:29,111
 were engraven upon

73
00:07:29,111 --> 00:07:29,0
 the plates of brass,

74
00:07:29,0 --> 00:07:30,889
 and he did search

75
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:31,778
 them from the

76
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,529
11 And he beheld

77
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:35,307
 that they did

78
00:07:35,307 --> 00:07:37,085
 contain the five books

79
00:07:37,085 --> 00:07:38,863
 of Moses, which

80
00:07:38,863 --> 00:07:40,641
 gave an account of

81
00:07:40,641 --> 00:07:42,419
 the creation of the

82
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:44,197
 world, and also

83
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:45,975
 of Adam and Eve,

84
00:07:45,975 --> 00:07:47,753
 who were our first

85
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:48,844
12 And also a

86
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:49,987
 record of the Jews

87
00:07:49,987 --> 00:07:51,13
 from the

88
00:07:51,13 --> 00:07:52,273
 beginning, even down to

89
00:07:52,273 --> 00:07:53,416
 the commencement of

90
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:54,559
 the reign of

91
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:55,702
 Zedekiah, king of

92
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:55,758
13 And also the

93
00:07:55,758 --> 00:07:55,841
 prophecies of

94
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:55,924
 the holy prophets,

95
00:07:55,924 --> 00:07:56,007
 from the

96
00:07:56,007 --> 00:07:56,09
 beginning, even down

97
00:07:56,09 --> 00:07:56,173
 to the

98
00:07:56,173 --> 00:07:56,256
 commencement of the reign

99
00:07:56,256 --> 00:07:56,339
 of Zedekiah; and

100
00:07:56,339 --> 00:07:56,422
 also many

101
00:07:56,422 --> 00:07:56,505
 prophecies which have

102
00:07:56,505 --> 00:07:56,588
 been spoken by

103
00:07:56,588 --> 00:07:56,671
 the mouth of

104
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:58,151
14 And it came

105
00:07:58,151 --> 00:08:00,193
 to pass that my

106
00:08:00,193 --> 00:08:02,235
 father, Lehi,

107
00:08:02,235 --> 00:08:04,277
 also found upon

108
00:08:04,277 --> 00:08:06,319
 the plates of

109
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,361
 brass a

110
00:08:08,361 --> 00:08:10,403
 genealogy of his

111
00:08:10,403 --> 00:08:12,445
 fathers; wherefore

112
00:08:12,445 --> 00:08:14,487
 he knew that he

113
00:08:14,487 --> 00:08:16,529
 was a

114
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,571
 descendant of Joseph;

115
00:08:18,571 --> 00:08:20,613
 yea, even that

116
00:08:20,613 --> 00:08:22,655
 Joseph who was

117
00:08:22,655 --> 00:08:24,697
 the son of Jacob,

118
00:08:24,697 --> 00:08:26,739
 who was sold

119
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:28,781
 into Egypt, and

120
00:08:28,781 --> 00:08:30,823
 who was

121
00:08:30,823 --> 00:08:32,865
 preserved by the hand

122
00:08:32,865 --> 00:08:34,907
 of the Lord,

123
00:08:34,907 --> 00:08:36,949
 that he might

124
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:38,991
 preserve his

125
00:08:38,991 --> 00:08:41,033
 father, Jacob, and

126
00:08:41,033 --> 00:08:43,075
 all his

127
00:08:43,075 --> 00:08:45,117
 household from

128
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:48,667
15 And they

129
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:51,542
 were also led

130
00:08:51,542 --> 00:08:54,417
 out of captivity

131
00:08:54,417 --> 00:08:57,292
 and out of

132
00:08:57,292 --> 00:09:00,167
 the land of

133
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:03,042
 Egypt, by that

134
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,917
 same God who had

135
00:09:05,917 --> 00:09:08,792
 preserved

136
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:13,382
16 And thus

137
00:09:13,382 --> 00:09:18,049
 my father,

138
00:09:18,049 --> 00:09:22,716
 Lehi, did

139
00:09:22,716 --> 00:09:27,383
 discover the

140
00:09:27,383 --> 00:09:32,05
 genealogy of his

141
00:09:32,05 --> 00:09:36,717
 fathers. And

142
00:09:36,717 --> 00:09:41,384
 Laban also was

143
00:09:41,384 --> 00:09:46,051
 a descendant

144
00:09:46,051 --> 00:09:50,718
 of Joseph,

145
00:09:50,718 --> 00:09:55,385
 wherefore he

146
00:09:55,385 --> 00:10:00,052
 and his fathers

147
00:10:00,052 --> 00:10:04,719
 had kept the

148
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:09,337
17 And now

149
00:10:09,337 --> 00:10:14,137
 when my

150
00:10:14,137 --> 00:10:18,937
 father saw all

151
00:10:18,937 --> 00:10:23,737
 these things,

152
00:10:23,737 --> 00:10:28,537
 he was

153
00:10:28,537 --> 00:10:33,337
 filled with the

154
00:10:33,337 --> 00:10:38,137
 Spirit, and

155
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:42,937
 began to

156
00:10:42,937 --> 00:10:47,737
 prophesy

157
00:10:47,737 --> 00:10:52,537
 concerning his

158
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:54,785
18 That

159
00:10:54,785 --> 00:10:57,185
 these plates

160
00:10:57,185 --> 00:10:59,585
 of brass

161
00:10:59,585 --> 00:11:01,985
 should go

162
00:11:01,985 --> 00:11:04,385
 forth unto all

163
00:11:04,385 --> 00:11:06,785
 nations,

164
00:11:06,785 --> 00:11:09,185
 kindreds,

165
00:11:09,185 --> 00:11:11,585
 tongues, and

166
00:11:11,585 --> 00:11:13,985
 people who

167
00:11:13,985 --> 00:11:16,385
 were of his

168
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,309
19

169
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:20,309
 Wherefore, he

170
00:11:20,309 --> 00:11:22,309
 said that

171
00:11:22,309 --> 00:11:24,309
 these plates

172
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:26,309
 of brass

173
00:11:26,309 --> 00:11:28,309
 should

174
00:11:28,309 --> 00:11:30,309
 never perish;

175
00:11:30,309 --> 00:11:32,309
 neither

176
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:34,309
 should they

177
00:11:34,309 --> 00:11:36,309
 be dimmed

178
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:38,309
 any more

179
00:11:38,309 --> 00:11:40,309
 by time.

180
00:11:40,309 --> 00:11:42,309
 And he

181
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:44,309
 prophesied many

182
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:46,309
 things

183
00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:48,309
 concerning

184
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:31,955
22

185
00:00:31,955 --> 00:00:32,011
 Wherefore,

186
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:32,067
 it was

187
00:00:32,067 --> 00:00:32,123
 wisdom

188
00:00:32,123 --> 00:00:32,179
 in the

189
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:32,235
 Lord

190
00:00:32,235 --> 00:00:32,291
 that we

191
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:32,347
 should

192
00:00:32,347 --> 00:00:32,403
 carry

193
00:00:32,403 --> 00:00:32,459
 them with

194
00:00:32,459 --> 00:00:32,515
 us, as

195
00:00:32,515 --> 00:00:32,571
 we

196
00:00:32,571 --> 00:00:32,627
 journeyed

197
00:00:32,627 --> 00:00:32,683
 in the

198
00:00:32,683 --> 00:00:32,739


199
00:00:32,739 --> 00:00:32,795
 wilderness

200
00:00:32,795 --> 00:00:32,851
