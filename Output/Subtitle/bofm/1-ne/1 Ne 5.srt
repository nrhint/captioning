00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:37,931
Chapter 5 Sariah complains against Lehi—Both

2
00:00:37,931 --> 00:00:44,931
 rejoice over the return of their sons—They offer

3
00:00:44,931 --> 00:00:51,931
 sacrifices—The plates of brass contain writings of Moses

4
00:00:51,931 --> 00:00:58,931
 and the prophets—The plates identify Lehi as a

5
00:00:58,931 --> 00:01:05,931
 descendant of Joseph—Lehi prophesies concerning his

6
00:01:05,931 --> 00:01:12,931
 seed and the preservation of the plates. About

7
00:01:12,931 --> 00:01:19,931
 600–592 B.C.

8
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:23,946
1 And it came to pass that after we had come down

9
00:01:23,946 --> 00:01:28,146
 into the wilderness unto our father, behold, he

10
00:01:28,146 --> 00:01:32,346
 was filled with joy, and also my mother, Sariah, was

11
00:01:32,346 --> 00:01:36,546
 exceedingly glad, for she truly had mourned

12
00:01:36,546 --> 00:01:40,746
 because of us

13
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:52,867
2 For she had supposed that we had perished in the

14
00:01:52,867 --> 00:02:04,867
 wilderness; and she also had complained against

15
00:02:04,867 --> 00:02:16,867
 my father, telling him that he was a visionary man;

16
00:02:16,867 --> 00:02:28,867
 saying: Behold thou hast led us forth from the

17
00:02:28,867 --> 00:02:40,867
 land of our inheritance, and my sons are no more,

18
00:02:40,867 --> 00:02:52,867
 and we perish in the wilderness

19
00:02:52,639 --> 00:03:24,639
3 And after this manner of language had my mother

20
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:56,639
 complained against my father

21
00:03:56,436 --> 00:04:01,769
4 And it had come to pass that my father spake

22
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:07,102
 unto her, saying: I know that I am a visionary man;

23
00:04:07,102 --> 00:04:12,435
 for if I had not seen the things of God in a vision

24
00:04:12,435 --> 00:04:17,768
 I should not have known the goodness of God, but

25
00:04:17,768 --> 00:04:23,101
 had tarried at Jerusalem, and had perished with my

26
00:04:23,101 --> 00:04:28,434
 brethren

27
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:49,135
5 But behold, I have obtained a land of promise,

28
00:04:49,135 --> 00:05:09,935
 in the which things I do rejoice; yea, and I know

29
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:30,735
 that the Lord will deliver my sons out of the hands

30
00:05:30,735 --> 00:05:51,535
 of Laban, and bring them down again unto us in

31
00:05:51,535 --> 00:06:12,335
 the wilderness

32
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:15,755
6 And after this manner of language did my father,

33
00:06:15,755 --> 00:06:19,505
 Lehi, comfort my mother, Sariah, concerning us,

34
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:23,255
 while we journeyed in the wilderness up to the land

35
00:06:23,255 --> 00:06:27,005
 of Jerusalem, to obtain the record of the Jews

36
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:30,621
7 And when we had returned to the tent of my

37
00:06:30,621 --> 00:06:33,288
 father, behold their joy was full, and my mother was

38
00:06:33,288 --> 00:06:35,955
 comforted

39
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:38,929
8 And she spake, saying: Now I know of a surety

40
00:06:38,929 --> 00:06:41,929
 that the Lord hath commanded my husband to flee into

41
00:06:41,929 --> 00:06:44,929
 the wilderness; yea, and I also know of a surety

42
00:06:44,929 --> 00:06:47,929
 that the Lord hath protected my sons, and

43
00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:50,929
 delivered them out of the hands of Laban, and given them

44
00:06:50,929 --> 00:06:53,929
 power whereby they could accomplish the thing which

45
00:06:53,929 --> 00:06:56,929
 the Lord hath commanded them. And after this

46
00:06:56,929 --> 00:06:59,929
 manner of language did she speak

47
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:05,853
9 And it came to pass that they did rejoice

48
00:07:05,853 --> 00:07:11,853
 exceedingly, and did offer sacrifice and burnt offerings

49
00:07:11,853 --> 00:07:17,853
 unto the Lord; and they gave thanks unto the God

50
00:07:17,853 --> 00:07:23,853
 of Israel

51
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,777
10 And after they had given thanks unto the God of

52
00:07:25,777 --> 00:07:27,777
 Israel, my father, Lehi, took the records which

53
00:07:27,777 --> 00:07:29,777
 were engraven upon the plates of brass, and he did

54
00:07:29,777 --> 00:07:31,777
 search them from the beginning

55
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:35,751
11 And he beheld that they did contain the five

56
00:07:35,751 --> 00:07:39,751
 books of Moses, which gave an account of the

57
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:43,751
 creation of the world, and also of Adam and Eve, who were

58
00:07:43,751 --> 00:07:47,751
 our first parents

59
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:50,368
12 And also a record of the Jews from the

60
00:07:50,368 --> 00:07:53,035
 beginning, even down to the commencement of the reign of

61
00:07:53,035 --> 00:07:55,702
 Zedekiah, king of Judah

62
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:55,925
13 And also the prophecies of the holy prophets,

63
00:07:55,925 --> 00:07:56,175
 from the beginning, even down to the commencement

64
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:56,425
 of the reign of Zedekiah; and also many prophecies

65
00:07:56,425 --> 00:07:56,675
 which have been spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah

66
00:07:56,109 --> 00:08:02,234
14 And it came to pass that my father, Lehi, also

67
00:08:02,234 --> 00:08:08,359
 found upon the plates of brass a genealogy of his

68
00:08:08,359 --> 00:08:14,484
 fathers; wherefore he knew that he was a

69
00:08:14,484 --> 00:08:20,609
 descendant of Joseph; yea, even that Joseph who was the son

70
00:08:20,609 --> 00:08:26,734
 of Jacob, who was sold into Egypt, and who was

71
00:08:26,734 --> 00:08:32,859
 preserved by the hand of the Lord, that he might

72
00:08:32,859 --> 00:08:38,984
 preserve his father, Jacob, and all his household

73
00:08:38,984 --> 00:08:45,109
 from perishing with famine

74
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:53,459
15 And they were also led out of captivity and out

75
00:08:53,459 --> 00:09:01,126
 of the land of Egypt, by that same God who had

76
00:09:01,126 --> 00:09:08,793
 preserved them

77
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:22,715
16 And thus my father, Lehi, did discover the

78
00:09:22,715 --> 00:09:36,715
 genealogy of his fathers. And Laban also was a

79
00:09:36,715 --> 00:09:50,715
 descendant of Joseph, wherefore he and his fathers had

80
00:09:50,715 --> 00:10:04,715
 kept the records

81
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:20,537
17 And now when my father saw all these things, he

82
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:36,537
 was filled with the Spirit, and began to prophesy

83
00:10:36,537 --> 00:10:52,537
 concerning his seed

84
00:10:52,385 --> 00:11:00,385
18 That these plates of brass should go forth unto

85
00:11:00,385 --> 00:11:08,385
 all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people who

86
00:11:08,385 --> 00:11:16,385
 were of his seed

87
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:24,309
19 Wherefore, he said that these plates of brass

88
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:32,309
 should never perish; neither should they be dimmed

89
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:40,309
 any more by time. And he prophesied many things

90
00:11:40,309 --> 00:11:48,309
 concerning his seed

91
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:32,232
22 Wherefore, it was wisdom in the Lord that we

92
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:32,565
 should carry them with us, as we journeyed in the

93
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:32,898
 wilderness towards the land of promise.
