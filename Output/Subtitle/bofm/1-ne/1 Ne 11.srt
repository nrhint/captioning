00:00:00,4 --> 00:00:08,257
Chapter 11 Nephi sees the Spirit of the Lord and

2
00:00:08,257 --> 00:00:16,114
 is shown in vision the tree of life—He sees the

3
00:00:16,114 --> 00:00:23,971
 mother of the Son of God and learns of the

4
00:00:23,971 --> 00:00:31,828
 condescension of God—He sees the baptism, ministry, and

5
00:00:31,828 --> 00:00:39,685
 crucifixion of the Lamb of God—He sees also the call

6
00:00:39,685 --> 00:00:47,542
 and ministry of the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb.

7
00:00:47,542 --> 00:00:55,399
 About 600–592 B.C.

8
00:00:55,122 --> 00:01:01,265
1 For it came to pass after I had desired to know

9
00:01:01,265 --> 00:01:07,408
 the things that my father had seen, and believing

10
00:01:07,408 --> 00:01:13,551
 that the Lord was able to make them known unto me,

11
00:01:13,551 --> 00:01:19,694
 as I sat pondering in mine heart I was caught

12
00:01:19,694 --> 00:01:25,837
 away in the Spirit of the Lord, yea, into an

13
00:01:25,837 --> 00:01:31,98
 exceedingly high mountain, which I never had before seen,

14
00:01:31,98 --> 00:01:38,123
 and upon which I never had before set my foot

15
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:42,999
2 And the Spirit said unto me: Behold, what

16
00:01:42,999 --> 00:01:46,999
 desirest thou

17
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,739
3 And I said: I desire to behold the things which

18
00:01:50,739 --> 00:01:55,239
 my father saw

19
00:01:55,082 --> 00:02:03,082
4 And the Spirit said unto me: Believest thou that

20
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:11,082
 thy father saw the tree of which he hath spoken

21
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:15,031
5 And I said: Yea, thou knowest that I believe all

22
00:02:15,031 --> 00:02:19,031
 the words of my father

23
00:02:19,94 --> 00:02:27,797
6 And when I had spoken these words, the Spirit

24
00:02:27,797 --> 00:02:35,654
 cried with a loud voice, saying: Hosanna to the

25
00:02:35,654 --> 00:02:43,511
 Lord, the most high God; for he is God over all the

26
00:02:43,511 --> 00:02:51,368
 earth, yea, even above all. And blessed art thou,

27
00:02:51,368 --> 00:02:59,225
 Nephi, because thou believest in the Son of the most

28
00:02:59,225 --> 00:03:07,082
 high God; wherefore, thou shalt behold the things

29
00:03:07,082 --> 00:03:14,939
 which thou hast desired

30
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:20,938
7 And behold this thing shall be given unto thee

31
00:03:20,938 --> 00:03:27,081
 for a sign, that after thou hast beheld the tree

32
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:33,224
 which bore the fruit which thy father tasted, thou

33
00:03:33,224 --> 00:03:39,367
 shalt also behold a man descending out of heaven,

34
00:03:39,367 --> 00:03:45,51
 and him shall ye witness; and after ye have

35
00:03:45,51 --> 00:03:51,653
 witnessed him ye shall bear record that it is the Son of

36
00:03:51,653 --> 00:03:57,796
 God

37
00:03:57,637 --> 00:04:05,304
8 And it came to pass that the Spirit said unto

38
00:04:05,304 --> 00:04:12,971
 me: Look! And I looked and beheld a tree; and it was

39
00:04:12,971 --> 00:04:20,638
 like unto the tree which my father had seen; and

40
00:04:20,638 --> 00:04:28,305
 the beauty thereof was far beyond, yea, exceeding

41
00:04:28,305 --> 00:04:35,972
 of all beauty; and the whiteness thereof did

42
00:04:35,972 --> 00:04:43,639
 exceed the whiteness of the driven snow

43
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:49,349
9 And it came to pass after I had seen the tree, I

44
00:04:49,349 --> 00:04:55,682
 said unto the Spirit: I behold thou hast shown

45
00:04:55,682 --> 00:05:02,015
 unto me the tree which is precious above all

46
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:10,035
10 And he said unto me: What desirest thou

47
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:17,144
11 And I said unto him: To know the interpretation

48
00:05:17,144 --> 00:05:23,311
 thereof—for I spake unto him as a man speaketh;

49
00:05:23,311 --> 00:05:29,478
 for I beheld that he was in the form of a man; yet

50
00:05:29,478 --> 00:05:35,645
 nevertheless, I knew that it was the Spirit of the

51
00:05:35,645 --> 00:05:41,812
 Lord; and he spake unto me as a man speaketh with

52
00:05:41,812 --> 00:05:47,979
 another

53
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:52,58
12 And it came to pass that he said unto me: Look!

54
00:05:52,58 --> 00:05:57,913
 And I looked as if to look upon him, and I saw

55
00:05:57,913 --> 00:06:03,246
 him not; for he had gone from before my presence

56
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:09,596
13 And it came to pass that I looked and beheld

57
00:06:09,596 --> 00:06:15,996
 the great city of Jerusalem, and also other cities.

58
00:06:15,996 --> 00:06:22,396
 And I beheld the city of Nazareth; and in the city

59
00:06:22,396 --> 00:06:28,796
 of Nazareth I beheld a virgin, and she was

60
00:06:28,796 --> 00:06:35,196
 exceedingly fair and white

61
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:44,762
14 And it came to pass that I saw the heavens

62
00:06:44,762 --> 00:06:54,429
 open; and an angel came down and stood before me; and

63
00:06:54,429 --> 00:07:04,096
 he said unto me: Nephi, what beholdest thou

64
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:11,357
15 And I said unto him: A virgin, most beautiful

65
00:07:11,357 --> 00:07:18,357
 and fair above all other virgins

66
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:23,871
16 And he said unto me: Knowest thou the

67
00:07:23,871 --> 00:07:29,371
 condescension of God

68
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:33,716
17 And I said unto him: I know that he loveth his

69
00:07:33,716 --> 00:07:38,383
 children; nevertheless, I do not know the meaning

70
00:07:38,383 --> 00:07:43,05
 of all things

71
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:48,73
18 And he said unto me: Behold, the virgin whom

72
00:07:48,73 --> 00:07:54,397
 thou seest is the mother of the Son of God, after

73
00:07:54,397 --> 00:08:00,064
 the manner of the flesh

74
00:08:00,58 --> 00:08:05,08
19 And it came to pass that I beheld that she was

75
00:08:05,08 --> 00:08:09,58
 carried away in the Spirit; and after she had been

76
00:08:09,58 --> 00:08:14,08
 carried away in the Spirit for the space of a

77
00:08:14,08 --> 00:08:18,58
 time the angel spake unto me, saying: Look

78
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:24,865
20 And I looked and beheld the virgin again,

79
00:08:24,865 --> 00:08:30,865
 bearing a child in her arms

80
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:36,344
21 And the angel said unto me: Behold the Lamb of

81
00:08:36,344 --> 00:08:41,844
 God, yea, even the Son of the Eternal Father!

82
00:08:41,844 --> 00:08:47,344
 Knowest thou the meaning of the tree which thy father

83
00:08:47,344 --> 00:08:52,844
 saw

84
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:59,649
22 And I answered him, saying: Yea, it is the love

85
00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:06,399
 of God, which sheddeth itself abroad in the

86
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:13,149
 hearts of the children of men; wherefore, it is the

87
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:19,899
 most desirable above all things

88
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:25,893
23 And he spake unto me, saying: Yea, and the most

89
00:09:25,893 --> 00:09:31,893
 joyous to the soul

90
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:38,421
24 And after he had said these words, he said unto

91
00:09:38,421 --> 00:09:45,671
 me: Look! And I looked, and I beheld the Son of

92
00:09:45,671 --> 00:09:52,921
 God going forth among the children of men; and I

93
00:09:52,921 --> 00:10:00,171
 saw many fall down at his feet and worship him

94
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:06,447
25 And it came to pass that I beheld that the rod

95
00:10:06,447 --> 00:10:12,161
 of iron, which my father had seen, was the word of

96
00:10:12,161 --> 00:10:17,875
 God, which led to the fountain of living waters,

97
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:23,589
 or to the tree of life; which waters are a

98
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:29,303
 representation of the love of God; and I also beheld that

99
00:10:29,303 --> 00:10:35,017
 the tree of life was a representation of the love

100
00:10:35,017 --> 00:10:40,731
 of God

101
00:10:40,44 --> 00:10:47,44
26 And the angel said unto me again: Look and

102
00:10:47,44 --> 00:10:54,44
 behold the condescension of God

103
00:10:54,187 --> 00:11:01,044
27 And I looked and beheld the Redeemer of the

104
00:11:01,044 --> 00:11:07,901
 world, of whom my father had spoken; and I also

105
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:14,758
 beheld the prophet who should prepare the way before

106
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:21,615
 him. And the Lamb of God went forth and was baptized

107
00:11:21,615 --> 00:11:28,472
 of him; and after he was baptized, I beheld the

108
00:11:28,472 --> 00:11:35,329
 heavens open, and the Holy Ghost come down out of

109
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:42,186
 heaven and abide upon him in the form of a dove

110
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:48,101
28 And I beheld that he went forth ministering

111
00:11:48,101 --> 00:11:54,101
 unto the people, in power and great glory; and the

112
00:11:54,101 --> 00:12:00,101
 multitudes were gathered together to hear him; and I

113
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:06,101
 beheld that they cast him out from among them

114
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:10,775
29 And I also beheld twelve others following him.

115
00:12:10,775 --> 00:12:15,525
 And it came to pass that they were carried away in

116
00:12:15,525 --> 00:12:20,275
 the Spirit from before my face, and I saw them

117
00:12:20,275 --> 00:12:25,025
 not

118
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:30,611
30 And it came to pass that the angel spake unto

119
00:12:30,611 --> 00:12:36,211
 me again, saying: Look! And I looked, and I beheld

120
00:12:36,211 --> 00:12:41,811
 the heavens open again, and I saw angels

121
00:12:41,811 --> 00:12:47,411
 descending upon the children of men; and they did minister

122
00:12:47,411 --> 00:12:53,011
 unto them

123
00:12:53,506 --> 00:13:00,173
31 And he spake unto me again, saying: Look! And I

124
00:13:00,173 --> 00:13:06,84
 looked, and I beheld the Lamb of God going forth

125
00:13:06,84 --> 00:13:13,507
 among the children of men. And I beheld multitudes

126
00:13:13,507 --> 00:13:20,174
 of people who were sick, and who were afflicted

127
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:26,841
 with all manner of diseases, and with devils and

128
00:13:26,841 --> 00:13:33,508
 unclean spirits; and the angel spake and showed all

129
00:13:33,508 --> 00:13:40,175
 these things unto me. And they were healed by the

130
00:13:40,175 --> 00:13:46,842
 power of the Lamb of God; and the devils and the

131
00:13:46,842 --> 00:13:53,509
 unclean spirits were cast out

132
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:59,699
32 And it came to pass that the angel spake unto

133
00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:06,299
 me again, saying: Look! And I looked and beheld the

134
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:12,899
 Lamb of God, that he was taken by the people;

135
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:19,499
 yea, the Son of the everlasting God was judged of the

136
00:14:19,499 --> 00:14:26,099
 world; and I saw and bear record

137
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:34,932
33 And I, Nephi, saw that he was lifted up upon

138
00:14:34,932 --> 00:14:43,432
 the cross and slain for the sins of the world

139
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:51,516
34 And after he was slain I saw the multitudes of

140
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:59,516
 the earth, that they were gathered together to

141
00:14:59,516 --> 00:15:07,516
 fight against the apostles of the Lamb; for thus were

142
00:15:07,516 --> 00:15:15,516
 the twelve called by the angel of the Lord

143
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:21,598
35 And the multitude of the earth was gathered

144
00:15:21,598 --> 00:15:27,848
 together; and I beheld that they were in a large and

145
00:15:27,848 --> 00:15:34,098
 spacious building, like unto the building which my

146
00:15:34,098 --> 00:15:40,348
 father saw. And the angel of the Lord spake unto

147
00:15:40,348 --> 00:15:46,598
 me again, saying: Behold the world and the wisdom

148
00:15:46,598 --> 00:15:52,848
 thereof; yea, behold the house of Israel hath

149
00:15:52,848 --> 00:15:59,098
 gathered together to fight against the twelve apostles

150
00:15:59,098 --> 00:16:05,348
 of the Lamb

151
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:07,273
36 And it came to pass that I saw and bear record,

152
00:16:07,273 --> 00:16:08,648
 that the great and spacious building was the

153
00:16:08,648 --> 00:16:10,023
 pride of the world; and it fell, and the fall thereof

154
00:16:10,023 --> 00:16:11,398
 was exceedingly great. And the angel of the Lord

155
00:16:11,398 --> 00:16:12,773
 spake unto me again, saying: Thus shall be the

156
00:16:12,773 --> 00:16:14,148
 destruction of all nations, kindreds, tongues, and

157
00:16:14,148 --> 00:16:15,523
 people, that shall fight against the twelve apostles

158
00:16:15,523 --> 00:16:16,898
 of the Lamb.
