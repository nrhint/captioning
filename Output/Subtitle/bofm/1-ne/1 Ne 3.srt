00:00:23,69 --> 00:00:29,357
Chapter 3 Lehi’s sons return to Jerusalem to

2
00:00:29,357 --> 00:00:35,024
 obtain the plates of brass—Laban refuses to give the

3
00:00:35,024 --> 00:00:40,691
 plates up—Nephi exhorts and encourages his

4
00:00:40,691 --> 00:00:46,358
 brethren—Laban steals their property and attempts to slay

5
00:00:46,358 --> 00:00:52,025
 them—Laman and Lemuel smite Nephi and Sam and are

6
00:00:52,025 --> 00:00:57,692
 reproved by an angel. About 600–592 B.C.

7
00:00:57,19 --> 00:01:28,857
1 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, returned from

8
00:01:28,857 --> 00:02:00,524
 speaking with the Lord, to the tent of my father

9
00:02:00,524 --> 00:02:32,191


10
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:38,886
2 And it came to pass that he spake unto me,

11
00:02:38,886 --> 00:02:44,886
 saying: Behold I have dreamed a dream, in the which the

12
00:02:44,886 --> 00:02:50,886
 Lord hath commanded me that thou and thy brethren

13
00:02:50,886 --> 00:02:56,886
 shall return to Jerusalem

14
00:02:56,81 --> 00:03:15,477
3 For behold, Laban hath the record of the Jews

15
00:03:15,477 --> 00:03:34,144
 and also a genealogy of my forefathers, and they are

16
00:03:34,144 --> 00:03:52,811
 engraven upon plates of brass

17
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:56,632
4 Wherefore, the Lord hath commanded me that thou

18
00:03:56,632 --> 00:04:00,632
 and thy brothers should go unto the house of

19
00:04:00,632 --> 00:04:04,632
 Laban, and seek the records, and bring them down hither

20
00:04:04,632 --> 00:04:08,632
 into the wilderness

21
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,582
5 And now, behold thy brothers murmur, saying it

22
00:04:10,582 --> 00:04:12,582
 is a hard thing which I have required of them; but

23
00:04:12,582 --> 00:04:14,582
 behold I have not required it of them, but it is a

24
00:04:14,582 --> 00:04:16,582
 commandment of the Lord

25
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:20,556
6 Therefore go, my son, and thou shalt be favored

26
00:04:20,556 --> 00:04:24,556
 of the Lord, because thou hast not murmured

27
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:25,864
7 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my

28
00:04:25,864 --> 00:04:27,197
 father: I will go and do the things which the Lord

29
00:04:27,197 --> 00:04:28,53
 hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth

30
00:04:28,53 --> 00:04:29,863
 no commandments unto the children of men, save he

31
00:04:29,863 --> 00:04:31,196
 shall prepare a way for them that they may

32
00:04:31,196 --> 00:04:32,529
 accomplish the thing which he commandeth them

33
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:35,173
8 And it came to pass that when my father had

34
00:04:35,173 --> 00:04:37,84
 heard these words he was exceedingly glad, for he knew

35
00:04:37,84 --> 00:04:40,507
 that I had been blessed of the Lord

36
00:04:40,48 --> 00:04:43,147
9 And I, Nephi, and my brethren took our journey

37
00:04:43,147 --> 00:04:45,814
 in the wilderness, with our tents, to go up to the

38
00:04:45,814 --> 00:04:48,481
 land of Jerusalem

39
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:51,122
10 And it came to pass that when we had gone up to

40
00:04:51,122 --> 00:04:53,789
 the land of Jerusalem, I and my brethren did

41
00:04:53,789 --> 00:04:56,456
 consult one with another

42
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:56,429
11 And we cast lots—who of us should go in unto

43
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:56,429
 the house of Laban. And it came to pass that the lot

44
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:56,429
 fell upon Laman; and Laman went in unto the house

45
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:56,429
 of Laban, and he talked with him as he sat in his

46
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:56,429
 house

47
00:04:56,83 --> 00:04:57,83
12 And he desired of Laban the records which were

48
00:04:57,83 --> 00:04:58,83
 engraven upon the plates of brass, which contained

49
00:04:58,83 --> 00:04:59,83
 the genealogy of my father

50
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,266
13 And behold, it came to pass that Laban was

51
00:05:01,266 --> 00:05:02,866
 angry, and thrust him out from his presence; and he

52
00:05:02,866 --> 00:05:04,466
 would not that he should have the records.

53
00:05:04,466 --> 00:05:06,066
 Wherefore, he said unto him: Behold thou art a robber, and

54
00:05:06,066 --> 00:05:07,666
 I will slay thee

55
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:10,841
14 But Laman fled out of his presence, and told

56
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:14,041
 the things which Laban had done, unto us. And we

57
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:17,241
 began to be exceedingly sorrowful, and my brethren

58
00:05:17,241 --> 00:05:20,441
 were about to return unto my father in the

59
00:05:20,441 --> 00:05:23,641
 wilderness

60
00:05:23,59 --> 00:05:37,59
15 But behold I said unto them that: As the Lord

61
00:05:37,59 --> 00:05:51,59
 liveth, and as we live, we will not go down unto

62
00:05:51,59 --> 00:06:05,59
 our father in the wilderness until we have

63
00:06:05,59 --> 00:06:19,59
 accomplished the thing which the Lord hath commanded us

64
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:26,112
16 Wherefore, let us be faithful in keeping the

65
00:06:26,112 --> 00:06:32,445
 commandments of the Lord; therefore let us go down

66
00:06:32,445 --> 00:06:38,778
 to the land of our father’s inheritance, for behold

67
00:06:38,778 --> 00:06:45,111
 he left gold and silver, and all manner of

68
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:51,444
 riches. And all this he hath done because of the

69
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:57,777
 commandments of the Lord

70
00:06:57,517 --> 00:07:03,017
17 For he knew that Jerusalem must be destroyed,

71
00:07:03,017 --> 00:07:08,517
 because of the wickedness of the people

72
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:09,861
18 For behold, they have rejected the words of the

73
00:07:09,861 --> 00:07:11,194
 prophets. Wherefore, if my father should dwell in

74
00:07:11,194 --> 00:07:12,527
 the land after he hath been commanded to flee out

75
00:07:12,527 --> 00:07:13,86
 of the land, behold, he would also perish.

76
00:07:13,86 --> 00:07:15,193
 Wherefore, it must needs be that he flee out of the

77
00:07:15,193 --> 00:07:16,526
 land

78
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:31,503
19 And behold, it is wisdom in God that we should

79
00:07:31,503 --> 00:07:46,503
 obtain these records, that we may preserve unto

80
00:07:46,503 --> 00:08:01,503
 our children the language of our fathers

81
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:07,981
20 And also that we may preserve unto them the

82
00:08:07,981 --> 00:08:14,581
 words which have been spoken by the mouth of all the

83
00:08:14,581 --> 00:08:21,181
 holy prophets, which have been delivered unto them

84
00:08:21,181 --> 00:08:27,781
 by the Spirit and power of God, since the world

85
00:08:27,781 --> 00:08:34,381
 began, even down unto this present time

86
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:42,548
21 And it came to pass that after this manner of

87
00:08:42,548 --> 00:08:50,215
 language did I persuade my brethren, that they

88
00:08:50,215 --> 00:08:57,882
 might be faithful in keeping the commandments of God

89
00:08:57,137 --> 00:09:01,887
22 And it came to pass that we went down to the

90
00:09:01,887 --> 00:09:06,637
 land of our inheritance, and we did gather together

91
00:09:06,637 --> 00:09:11,387
 our gold, and our silver, and our precious things

92
00:09:11,387 --> 00:09:16,137


93
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:21,956
23 And after we had gathered these things

94
00:09:21,956 --> 00:09:27,456
 together, we went up again unto the house of Laban

95
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:32,967
24 And it came to pass that we went in unto Laban,

96
00:09:32,967 --> 00:09:37,967
 and desired him that he would give unto us the

97
00:09:37,967 --> 00:09:42,967
 records which were engraven upon the plates of

98
00:09:42,967 --> 00:09:47,967
 brass, for which we would give unto him our gold, and

99
00:09:47,967 --> 00:09:52,967
 our silver, and all our precious things

100
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:58,859
25 And it came to pass that when Laban saw our

101
00:09:58,859 --> 00:10:05,059
 property, and that it was exceedingly great, he did

102
00:10:05,059 --> 00:10:11,259
 lust after it, insomuch that he thrust us out, and

103
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:17,459
 sent his servants to slay us, that he might obtain

104
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:23,659
 our property

105
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:28,123
26 And it came to pass that we did flee before the

106
00:10:28,123 --> 00:10:32,623
 servants of Laban, and we were obliged to leave

107
00:10:32,623 --> 00:10:37,123
 behind our property, and it fell into the hands of

108
00:10:37,123 --> 00:10:41,623
 Laban

109
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:48,041
27 And it came to pass that we fled into the

110
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:54,708
 wilderness, and the servants of Laban did not overtake

111
00:10:54,708 --> 00:11:01,375
 us, and we hid ourselves in the cavity of a rock

112
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:08,227
28 And it came to pass that Laman was angry with

113
00:11:08,227 --> 00:11:15,227
 me, and also with my father; and also was Lemuel,

114
00:11:15,227 --> 00:11:22,227
 for he hearkened unto the words of Laman. Wherefore

115
00:11:22,227 --> 00:11:29,227
 Laman and Lemuel did speak many hard words unto

116
00:11:29,227 --> 00:11:36,227
 us, their younger brothers, and they did smite us

117
00:11:36,227 --> 00:11:43,227
 even with a rod

118
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:50,344
29 And it came to pass as they smote us with a

119
00:11:50,344 --> 00:11:57,219
 rod, behold, an angel of the Lord came and stood

120
00:11:57,219 --> 00:12:04,094
 before them, and he spake unto them, saying: Why do ye

121
00:12:04,094 --> 00:12:10,969
 smite your younger brother with a rod? Know ye

122
00:12:10,969 --> 00:12:17,844
 not that the Lord hath chosen him to be a ruler over

123
00:12:17,844 --> 00:12:24,719
 you, and this because of your iniquities? Behold

124
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:31,594
 ye shall go up to Jerusalem again, and the Lord

125
00:12:31,594 --> 00:12:38,469
 will deliver Laban into your hands

126
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:41,858
30 And after the angel had spoken unto us, he

127
00:12:41,858 --> 00:12:45,358
 departed

128
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:48,698
31 And after the angel had departed, Laman and

129
00:12:48,698 --> 00:12:52,031
 Lemuel again began to murmur, saying: How is it

130
00:12:52,031 --> 00:12:55,364
 possible that the Lord will deliver Laban into our

131
00:12:55,364 --> 00:12:58,697
 hands? Behold, he is a mighty man, and he can command

132
00:12:58,697 --> 00:13:02,03
 fifty, yea, even he can slay fifty; then why not

133
00:13:02,03 --> 00:13:05,363
 us?
