1
00:00:23,69 --> 00:00:30,49
Chapter 3 Lehi’s sons return to Jerusalem to obtain the 

2
00:00:30,49 --> 00:00:37,29
plates of brass—Laban refuses to give the plates up—Nephi exhorts 

3
00:00:37,29 --> 00:00:44,09
and encourages his brethren—Laban steals their property and attempts to 

4
00:00:44,09 --> 00:00:50,89
slay them—Laman and Lemuel smite Nephi and Sam and are 

5
00:00:50,89 --> 00:00:57,19
reproved by an angel. About 600–592 B.C.  

6
00:00:57,19 --> 00:01:28,857
1 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, returned 

7
00:01:28,857 --> 00:02:00,524
from speaking with the Lord, to the tent of my 

8
00:02:00,524 --> 00:02:32,886
father. 

9
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:38,886
2 And it came to pass that he spake unto 

10
00:02:38,886 --> 00:02:44,886
me, saying: Behold I have dreamed a dream, in the 

11
00:02:44,886 --> 00:02:50,886
which the Lord hath commanded me that thou and thy 

12
00:02:50,886 --> 00:02:56,81
brethren shall return to Jerusalem. 

13
00:02:56,81 --> 00:03:15,477
3 For behold, Laban hath the record of the Jews 

14
00:03:15,477 --> 00:03:34,144
and also a genealogy of my forefathers, and they are 

15
00:03:34,144 --> 00:03:52,632
engraven upon plates of brass. 

16
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:56,632
4 Wherefore, the Lord hath commanded me that thou and 

17
00:03:56,632 --> 00:04:00,632
thy brothers should go unto the house of Laban, and 

18
00:04:00,632 --> 00:04:04,632
seek the records, and bring them down hither into the 

19
00:04:04,632 --> 00:04:08,582
wilderness. 

20
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,582
5 And now, behold thy brothers murmur, saying it is 

21
00:04:10,582 --> 00:04:12,582
a hard thing which I have required of them; but 

22
00:04:12,582 --> 00:04:14,582
behold I have not required it of them, but it 

23
00:04:14,582 --> 00:04:16,556
is a commandment of the Lord. 

24
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:20,556
6 Therefore go, my son, and thou shalt be favored 

25
00:04:20,556 --> 00:04:24,531
of the Lord, because thou hast not murmured. 

26
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:25,864
7 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said 

27
00:04:25,864 --> 00:04:27,197
unto my father: I will go and do the things 

28
00:04:27,197 --> 00:04:28,53
which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the 

29
00:04:28,53 --> 00:04:29,863
Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save 

30
00:04:29,863 --> 00:04:31,196
he shall prepare a way for them that they may 

31
00:04:31,196 --> 00:04:32,506
accomplish the thing which he commandeth them. 

32
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:35,173
8 And it came to pass that when my father 

33
00:04:35,173 --> 00:04:37,84
had heard these words he was exceedingly glad, for he 

34
00:04:37,84 --> 00:04:40,48
knew that I had been blessed of the Lord. 

35
00:04:40,48 --> 00:04:43,147
9 And I, Nephi, and my brethren took our journey 

36
00:04:43,147 --> 00:04:45,814
in the wilderness, with our tents, to go up to 

37
00:04:45,814 --> 00:04:48,455
the land of Jerusalem. 

38
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:51,122
10 And it came to pass that when we had 

39
00:04:51,122 --> 00:04:53,789
gone up to the land of Jerusalem, I and my 

40
00:04:53,789 --> 00:04:56,429
brethren did consult one with another. 

41
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:56,429
11 And we cast lots—who of us should go in 

42
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:56,429
unto the house of Laban. And it came to pass 

43
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:56,429
that the lot fell upon Laman; and Laman went in 

44
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:56,429
unto the house of Laban, and he talked with him 

45
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:56,83
as he sat in his house. 

46
00:04:56,83 --> 00:04:57,83
12 And he desired of Laban the records which were 

47
00:04:57,83 --> 00:04:58,83
engraven upon the plates of brass, which contained the genealogy 

48
00:04:58,83 --> 00:04:59,666
of my father. 

49
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,266
13 And behold, it came to pass that Laban was 

50
00:05:01,266 --> 00:05:02,866
angry, and thrust him out from his presence; and he 

51
00:05:02,866 --> 00:05:04,466
would not that he should have the records. Wherefore, he 

52
00:05:04,466 --> 00:05:06,066
said unto him: Behold thou art a robber, and I 

53
00:05:06,066 --> 00:05:07,641
will slay thee. 

54
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:11,641
14 But Laman fled out of his presence, and told 

55
00:05:11,641 --> 00:05:15,641
the things which Laban had done, unto us. And we 

56
00:05:15,641 --> 00:05:19,641
began to be exceedingly sorrowful, and my brethren were about 

57
00:05:19,641 --> 00:05:23,59
to return unto my father in the wilderness. 

58
00:05:23,59 --> 00:05:37,59
15 But behold I said unto them that: As the 

59
00:05:37,59 --> 00:05:51,59
Lord liveth, and as we live, we will not go 

60
00:05:51,59 --> 00:06:05,59
down unto our father in the wilderness until we have 

61
00:06:05,59 --> 00:06:19,779
accomplished the thing which the Lord hath commanded us. 

62
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:27,379
16 Wherefore, let us be faithful in keeping the commandments 

63
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:34,979
of the Lord; therefore let us go down to the 

64
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:42,579
land of our father’s inheritance, for behold he left gold 

65
00:06:42,579 --> 00:06:50,179
and silver, and all manner of riches. And all this 

66
00:06:50,179 --> 00:06:57,517
he hath done because of the commandments of the Lord. 

67
00:06:57,517 --> 00:07:03,017
17 For he knew that Jerusalem must be destroyed, because 

68
00:07:03,017 --> 00:07:08,528
of the wickedness of the people. 

69
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,128
18 For behold, they have rejected the words of the 

70
00:07:10,128 --> 00:07:11,728
prophets. Wherefore, if my father should dwell in the land 

71
00:07:11,728 --> 00:07:13,328
after he hath been commanded to flee out of the 

72
00:07:13,328 --> 00:07:14,928
land, behold, he would also perish. Wherefore, it must needs 

73
00:07:14,928 --> 00:07:16,503
be that he flee out of the land. 

74
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:31,503
19 And behold, it is wisdom in God that we 

75
00:07:31,503 --> 00:07:46,503
should obtain these records, that we may preserve unto our 

76
00:07:46,503 --> 00:08:01,381
children the language of our fathers; 

77
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:07,981
20 And also that we may preserve unto them the 

78
00:08:07,981 --> 00:08:14,581
words which have been spoken by the mouth of all 

79
00:08:14,581 --> 00:08:21,181
the holy prophets, which have been delivered unto them by 

80
00:08:21,181 --> 00:08:27,781
the Spirit and power of God, since the world began, 

81
00:08:27,781 --> 00:08:34,881
even down unto this present time. 

82
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:42,548
21 And it came to pass that after this manner 

83
00:08:42,548 --> 00:08:50,215
of language did I persuade my brethren, that they might 

84
00:08:50,215 --> 00:08:57,137
be faithful in keeping the commandments of God. 

85
00:08:57,137 --> 00:09:03,47
22 And it came to pass that we went down 

86
00:09:03,47 --> 00:09:09,803
to the land of our inheritance, and we did gather 

87
00:09:09,803 --> 00:09:16,456
together our gold, and our silver, and our precious things. 

88
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:21,956
23 And after we had gathered these things together, we 

89
00:09:21,956 --> 00:09:27,967
went up again unto the house of Laban. 

90
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:32,967
24 And it came to pass that we went in 

91
00:09:32,967 --> 00:09:37,967
unto Laban, and desired him that he would give unto 

92
00:09:37,967 --> 00:09:42,967
us the records which were engraven upon the plates of 

93
00:09:42,967 --> 00:09:47,967
brass, for which we would give unto him our gold, 

94
00:09:47,967 --> 00:09:52,659
and our silver, and all our precious things. 

95
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:58,859
25 And it came to pass that when Laban saw 

96
00:09:58,859 --> 00:10:05,059
our property, and that it was exceedingly great, he did 

97
00:10:05,059 --> 00:10:11,259
lust after it, insomuch that he thrust us out, and 

98
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:17,459
sent his servants to slay us, that he might obtain 

99
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:23,623
our property. 

100
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:28,123
26 And it came to pass that we did flee 

101
00:10:28,123 --> 00:10:32,623
before the servants of Laban, and we were obliged to 

102
00:10:32,623 --> 00:10:37,123
leave behind our property, and it fell into the hands 

103
00:10:37,123 --> 00:10:41,374
of Laban. 

104
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:46,374
27 And it came to pass that we fled into 

105
00:10:46,374 --> 00:10:51,374
the wilderness, and the servants of Laban did not overtake 

106
00:10:51,374 --> 00:10:56,374
us, and we hid ourselves in the cavity of a 

107
00:10:56,374 --> 00:11:01,227
rock. 

108
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:08,227
28 And it came to pass that Laman was angry 

109
00:11:08,227 --> 00:11:15,227
with me, and also with my father; and also was 

110
00:11:15,227 --> 00:11:22,227
Lemuel, for he hearkened unto the words of Laman. Wherefore 

111
00:11:22,227 --> 00:11:29,227
Laman and Lemuel did speak many hard words unto us, 

112
00:11:29,227 --> 00:11:36,227
their younger brothers, and they did smite us even with 

113
00:11:36,227 --> 00:11:43,469
a rod. 

114
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:50,344
29 And it came to pass as they smote us 

115
00:11:50,344 --> 00:11:57,219
with a rod, behold, an angel of the Lord came 

116
00:11:57,219 --> 00:12:04,094
and stood before them, and he spake unto them, saying: 

117
00:12:04,094 --> 00:12:10,969
Why do ye smite your younger brother with a rod? 

118
00:12:10,969 --> 00:12:17,844
Know ye not that the Lord hath chosen him to 

119
00:12:17,844 --> 00:12:24,719
be a ruler over you, and this because of your 

120
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:31,594
iniquities? Behold ye shall go up to Jerusalem again, and 

121
00:12:31,594 --> 00:12:38,358
the Lord will deliver Laban into your hands. 

122
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:41,858
30 And after the angel had spoken unto us, he 

123
00:12:41,858 --> 00:12:45,365
departed. 

124
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:49,365
31 And after the angel had departed, Laman and Lemuel 

125
00:12:49,365 --> 00:12:53,365
again began to murmur, saying: How is it possible that 

126
00:12:53,365 --> 00:12:57,365
the Lord will deliver Laban into our hands? Behold, he 

127
00:12:57,365 --> 00:13:01,365
is a mighty man, and he can command fifty, yea, 

128
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:05,084
even he can slay fifty; then why not us?
