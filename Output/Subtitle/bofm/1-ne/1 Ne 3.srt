00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 3 Lehi’s sons return to Jerusalem to

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
obtain the plates of brass—Laban refuses to give

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the plates up—Nephi exhorts and encourages his

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
brethren—Laban steals their property and attempts

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
to slay them—Laman and Lemuel smite Nephi and Sam

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:11:57,
and are reproved by an angel. About 600–592 B.C. 

7
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
1 And it came to pass that I,

8
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
Nephi, returned from speaking with

9
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:43,
the Lord, to the tent of my father.

10
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
2 And it came to pass that he

11
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
spake unto me, saying:

12
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
Behold I have dreamed a dream, in

13
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
the which the Lord hath

14
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
commanded me that thou and thy

15
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:15,
brethren shall return to Jerusalem.

16
00:11:15,0 --> 00:11:15,0
3 For behold, Laban hath

17
00:11:15,0 --> 00:11:15,0
the record of the Jews and

18
00:11:15,0 --> 00:11:15,0
also a genealogy of my

19
00:11:15,0 --> 00:11:15,0
forefathers, and they are

20
00:11:15,0 --> 00:15:43,
engraven upon plates of brass.

21
00:15:43,0 --> 00:15:43,0
4 Wherefore, the Lord

22
00:15:43,0 --> 00:15:43,0
hath commanded me that

23
00:15:43,0 --> 00:15:43,0
thou and thy brothers

24
00:15:43,0 --> 00:15:43,0
should go unto the house of

25
00:15:43,0 --> 00:15:43,0
Laban, and seek the

26
00:15:43,0 --> 00:15:43,0
records, and bring them down

27
00:15:43,0 --> 00:17:27,
hither into the wilderness.

28
00:17:27,0 --> 00:17:27,0
5 And now, behold thy

29
00:17:27,0 --> 00:17:27,0
brothers murmur,

30
00:17:27,0 --> 00:17:27,0
saying it is a hard

31
00:17:27,0 --> 00:17:27,0
thing which I have

32
00:17:27,0 --> 00:17:27,0
required of them; but

33
00:17:27,0 --> 00:17:27,0
behold I have not required

34
00:17:27,0 --> 00:17:27,0
it of them, but it

35
00:17:27,0 --> 00:25:24,
is a commandment of the Lord.

36
00:25:24,0 --> 00:25:24,0
6 Therefore go, my

37
00:25:24,0 --> 00:25:24,0
son, and thou

38
00:25:24,0 --> 00:25:24,0
shalt be favored of

39
00:25:24,0 --> 00:25:24,0
the Lord, because

40
00:25:24,0 --> 00:25:10,
thou hast not murmured.

41
00:25:10,0 --> 00:25:10,0
7 And it came to

42
00:25:10,0 --> 00:25:10,0
pass that I, Nephi,

43
00:25:10,0 --> 00:25:10,0
said unto my

44
00:25:10,0 --> 00:25:10,0
father: I will go and

45
00:25:10,0 --> 00:25:10,0
do the things

46
00:25:10,0 --> 00:25:10,0
which the Lord hath

47
00:25:10,0 --> 00:25:10,0
commanded, for I

48
00:25:10,0 --> 00:25:10,0
know that the Lord

49
00:25:10,0 --> 00:25:10,0
giveth no

50
00:25:10,0 --> 00:25:10,0
commandments unto the

51
00:25:10,0 --> 00:25:10,0
children of men, save he

52
00:25:10,0 --> 00:25:10,0
shall prepare a

53
00:25:10,0 --> 00:25:10,0
way for them that

54
00:25:10,0 --> 00:25:10,0
they may accomplish

55
00:25:10,0 --> 00:25:10,0
the thing which

56
00:25:10,0 --> 00:24:42,
he commandeth them.

57
00:24:42,0 --> 00:24:42,0
8 And it came to

58
00:24:42,0 --> 00:24:42,0
pass that when my

59
00:24:42,0 --> 00:24:42,0
father had heard

60
00:24:42,0 --> 00:24:42,0
these words he

61
00:24:42,0 --> 00:24:42,0
was exceedingly

62
00:24:42,0 --> 00:24:42,0
glad, for he knew

63
00:24:42,0 --> 00:24:42,0
that I had been

64
00:24:42,0 --> 00:26:26,
blessed of the Lord.

65
00:26:26,0 --> 00:26:26,0
9 And I, Nephi,

66
00:26:26,0 --> 00:26:26,0
and my brethren

67
00:26:26,0 --> 00:26:26,0
took our journey

68
00:26:26,0 --> 00:26:26,0
in the

69
00:26:26,0 --> 00:26:26,0
wilderness, with our

70
00:26:26,0 --> 00:26:26,0
tents, to go up to

71
00:26:26,0 --> 00:26:56,
the land of Jerusalem.

72
00:26:56,0 --> 00:26:56,0
10 And it came

73
00:26:56,0 --> 00:26:56,0
to pass that

74
00:26:56,0 --> 00:26:56,0
when we had gone

75
00:26:56,0 --> 00:26:56,0
up to the land

76
00:26:56,0 --> 00:26:56,0
of Jerusalem, I

77
00:26:56,0 --> 00:26:56,0
and my

78
00:26:56,0 --> 00:26:56,0
brethren did consult

79
00:26:56,0 --> 00:26:28,
one with another.

80
00:26:28,0 --> 00:26:28,0
11 And we cast

81
00:26:28,0 --> 00:26:28,0
lots—who of

82
00:26:28,0 --> 00:26:28,0
us should go in

83
00:26:28,0 --> 00:26:28,0
unto the

84
00:26:28,0 --> 00:26:28,0
house of Laban.

85
00:26:28,0 --> 00:26:28,0
And it came to

86
00:26:28,0 --> 00:26:28,0
pass that the

87
00:26:28,0 --> 00:26:28,0
lot fell upon

88
00:26:28,0 --> 00:26:28,0
Laman; and

89
00:26:28,0 --> 00:26:28,0
Laman went in unto

90
00:26:28,0 --> 00:26:28,0
the house of

91
00:26:28,0 --> 00:26:28,0
Laban, and he

92
00:26:28,0 --> 00:26:28,0
talked with

93
00:26:28,0 --> 00:27:26,
him as he sat in his house.

94
00:27:26,0 --> 00:27:26,0
12 And he

95
00:27:26,0 --> 00:27:26,0
desired of

96
00:27:26,0 --> 00:27:26,0
Laban the

97
00:27:26,0 --> 00:27:26,0
records which

98
00:27:26,0 --> 00:27:26,0
were engraven

99
00:27:26,0 --> 00:27:26,0
upon the

100
00:27:26,0 --> 00:27:26,0
plates of brass,

101
00:27:26,0 --> 00:27:26,0
which

102
00:27:26,0 --> 00:27:26,0
contained the

103
00:27:26,0 --> 00:34:56,
genealogy of my father.

104
00:34:56,0 --> 00:34:56,0
13 And

105
00:34:56,0 --> 00:34:56,0
behold, it came

106
00:34:56,0 --> 00:34:56,0
to pass

107
00:34:56,0 --> 00:34:56,0
that Laban

108
00:34:56,0 --> 00:34:56,0
was angry,

109
00:34:56,0 --> 00:34:56,0
and thrust

110
00:34:56,0 --> 00:34:56,0
him out from

111
00:34:56,0 --> 00:34:56,0
his

112
00:34:56,0 --> 00:34:56,0
presence; and he

113
00:34:56,0 --> 00:34:56,0
would not

114
00:34:56,0 --> 00:34:56,0
that he

115
00:34:56,0 --> 00:34:56,0
should have the

116
00:34:56,0 --> 00:34:56,0
records.

117
00:34:56,0 --> 00:34:56,0
Wherefore, he

118
00:34:56,0 --> 00:34:56,0
said unto

119
00:34:56,0 --> 00:34:56,0
him: Behold

120
00:34:56,0 --> 00:34:56,0
thou art a

121
00:34:56,0 --> 00:34:56,0
robber,

122
00:34:56,0 --> 00:44:38,
and I will slay thee.

123
00:44:38,0 --> 00:44:38,0
14 But

124
00:44:38,0 --> 00:44:38,0
Laman fled

125
00:44:38,0 --> 00:44:38,0
out of his

126
00:44:38,0 --> 00:44:38,0
presence,

127
00:44:38,0 --> 00:44:38,0
and told

128
00:44:38,0 --> 00:44:38,0
the things

129
00:44:38,0 --> 00:44:38,0
which Laban

130
00:44:38,0 --> 00:44:38,0
had done,

131
00:44:38,0 --> 00:44:38,0
unto us.

132
00:44:38,0 --> 00:44:38,0
And we

133
00:44:38,0 --> 00:44:38,0
began to be

134
00:44:38,0 --> 00:44:38,0
exceedingly

135
00:44:38,0 --> 00:44:38,0


136
00:44:38,0 --> 00:44:38,0
sorrowful, and my

137
00:44:38,0 --> 00:44:38,0
brethren

138
00:44:38,0 --> 00:44:38,0
were about

139
00:44:38,0 --> 00:44:38,0
to return

140
00:44:38,0 --> 00:44:38,0
unto my

141
00:44:38,0 --> 00:48:09,
father in the wilderness.

142
00:48:09,0 --> 00:48:09,0
15 But

143
00:48:09,0 --> 00:48:09,0
behold I

144
00:48:09,0 --> 00:48:09,0
said unto

145
00:48:09,0 --> 00:48:09,0
them that:

146
00:48:09,0 --> 00:48:09,0
As the

147
00:48:09,0 --> 00:48:09,0
Lord

148
00:48:09,0 --> 00:48:09,0
liveth, and as

149
00:48:09,0 --> 00:48:09,0
we live,

150
00:48:09,0 --> 00:48:09,0
we will

151
00:48:09,0 --> 00:48:09,0
not go

152
00:48:09,0 --> 00:48:09,0
down unto

153
00:48:09,0 --> 00:48:09,0
our father

154
00:48:09,0 --> 00:48:09,0
in the

155
00:48:09,0 --> 00:48:09,0
wilderness

156
00:48:09,0 --> 00:48:09,0
until we

157
00:48:09,0 --> 00:48:09,0
have

158
00:48:09,0 --> 00:48:09,0
accomplished

159
00:48:09,0 --> 00:48:09,0
the

160
00:48:09,0 --> 00:48:09,0
thing which

161
00:48:09,0 --> 00:53:05,
the Lord hath commanded us.

162
00:53:05,0 --> 00:53:05,0
16

163
00:53:05,0 --> 00:53:05,0
Wherefore,

164
00:53:05,0 --> 00:53:05,0
let us be

165
00:53:05,0 --> 00:53:05,0
faithful

166
00:53:05,0 --> 00:53:05,0
in

167
00:53:05,0 --> 00:53:05,0
keeping the

168
00:53:05,0 --> 00:53:05,0


169
00:53:05,0 --> 00:53:05,0
commandments of

170
00:53:05,0 --> 00:53:05,0
the

171
00:53:05,0 --> 00:53:05,0
Lord;

172
00:53:05,0 --> 00:53:05,0
therefore let

173
00:53:05,0 --> 00:53:05,0
us go

174
00:53:05,0 --> 00:53:05,0
down to

175
00:53:05,0 --> 00:53:05,0
the land

176
00:53:05,0 --> 00:53:05,0
of our

177
00:53:05,0 --> 00:53:05,0
father’s

178
00:53:05,0 --> 00:53:05,0


179
00:53:05,0 --> 00:53:05,0
inheritance, for

180
00:53:05,0 --> 00:53:05,0
behold

181
00:53:05,0 --> 00:53:05,0
he left

182
00:53:05,0 --> 00:53:05,0
gold and

183
00:53:05,0 --> 00:53:05,0
silver,

184
00:53:05,0 --> 00:53:05,0
and all

185
00:53:05,0 --> 00:53:05,0
manner

186
00:53:05,0 --> 00:53:05,0
of

187
00:53:05,0 --> 00:53:05,0
riches. And

188
00:53:05,0 --> 00:53:05,0
all this

189
00:53:05,0 --> 00:53:05,0
he hath

190
00:53:05,0 --> 00:53:05,0
done

191
00:53:05,0 --> 00:54:49,
because of the commandments of the Lord.

192
00:54:49,0 --> 00:54:49,0
17 For

193
00:54:49,0 --> 00:54:49,0
he knew

194
00:54:49,0 --> 00:54:49,0
that

195
00:54:49,0 --> 00:54:49,0


196
00:54:49,0 --> 00:54:49,0
Jerusalem must

197
00:54:49,0 --> 00:54:49,0
be

198
00:54:49,0 --> 00:54:49,0
destroyed,

199
00:54:49,0 --> 00:54:49,0
because

200
00:54:49,0 --> 00:54:49,0
of the

201
00:54:49,0 --> 00:54:49,0


202
00:54:49,0 --> 00:54:49,0
wickedness of

203
00:54:49,0 --> 00:56:33,
the people.

204
00:56:33,0 --> 00:56:33,0
18 For

205
00:56:33,0 --> 00:56:33,0


206
00:56:33,0 --> 00:56:33,0
behold,

207
00:56:33,0 --> 00:56:33,0
they have

208
00:56:33,0 --> 00:56:33,0


209
00:56:33,0 --> 00:56:33,0
rejected

210
00:56:33,0 --> 00:56:33,0
the

211
00:56:33,0 --> 00:56:33,0
words of

212
00:56:33,0 --> 00:56:33,0
the

213
00:56:33,0 --> 00:56:33,0
prophets.

214
00:56:33,0 --> 00:56:33,0


215
00:56:33,0 --> 00:56:33,0
Wherefore,

216
00:56:33,0 --> 00:56:33,0
if my

217
00:56:33,0 --> 00:56:33,0
father

218
00:56:33,0 --> 00:56:33,0


219
00:56:33,0 --> 00:56:33,0
should

220
00:56:33,0 --> 00:56:33,0
dwell in

221
00:56:33,0 --> 00:56:33,0
the

222
00:56:33,0 --> 00:56:33,0
land

223
00:56:33,0 --> 00:56:33,0
after he

224
00:56:33,0 --> 00:56:33,0
hath

225
00:56:33,0 --> 00:56:33,0
been

226
00:56:33,0 --> 00:56:33,0
commanded

227
00:56:33,0 --> 00:56:33,0
to

228
00:56:33,0 --> 00:56:33,0
