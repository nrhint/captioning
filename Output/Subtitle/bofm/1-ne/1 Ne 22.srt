1
00:00:00,4 --> 00:00:10,543
Chapter 22 Israel will be scattered upon all the

2
00:00:10,543 --> 00:00:20,686
 face of the earth—The Gentiles will nurse and

3
00:00:20,686 --> 00:00:30,829
 nourish Israel with the gospel in the last days—Israel

4
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:40,972
 will be gathered and saved, and the wicked will

5
00:00:40,972 --> 00:00:51,115
 burn as stubble—The kingdom of the devil will be

6
00:00:51,115 --> 00:01:01,258
 destroyed, and Satan will be bound. About

7
00:01:01,258 --> 00:01:11,401
 588–570 B.C.

8
00:01:11,338 --> 00:01:16,052
1 And now it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had

9
00:01:16,052 --> 00:01:20,766
 read these things which were engraven upon the

10
00:01:20,766 --> 00:01:25,48
 plates of brass, my brethren came unto me and said

11
00:01:25,48 --> 00:01:30,194
 unto me: What meaneth these things which ye have

12
00:01:30,194 --> 00:01:34,908
 read? Behold, are they to be understood according to

13
00:01:34,908 --> 00:01:39,622
 things which are spiritual, which shall come to

14
00:01:39,622 --> 00:01:44,336
 pass according to the spirit and not the flesh

15
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:49,704
2 And I, Nephi, said unto them: Behold they were

16
00:01:49,704 --> 00:01:54,904
 manifest unto the prophet by the voice of the

17
00:01:54,904 --> 00:02:00,104
 Spirit; for by the Spirit are all things made known

18
00:02:00,104 --> 00:02:05,304
 unto the prophets, which shall come upon the children

19
00:02:05,304 --> 00:02:10,504
 of men according to the flesh

20
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:17,064
3 Wherefore, the things of which I have read are

21
00:02:17,064 --> 00:02:23,464
 things pertaining to things both temporal and

22
00:02:23,464 --> 00:02:29,864
 spiritual; for it appears that the house of Israel,

23
00:02:29,864 --> 00:02:36,264
 sooner or later, will be scattered upon all the face

24
00:02:36,264 --> 00:02:42,664
 of the earth, and also among all nations

25
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:48,334
4 And behold, there are many who are already lost

26
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:53,905
 from the knowledge of those who are at Jerusalem.

27
00:02:53,905 --> 00:02:59,476
 Yea, the more part of all the tribes have been led

28
00:02:59,476 --> 00:03:05,047
 away; and they are scattered to and fro upon the

29
00:03:05,047 --> 00:03:10,618
 isles of the sea; and whither they are none of us

30
00:03:10,618 --> 00:03:16,189
 knoweth, save that we know that they have been led

31
00:03:16,189 --> 00:03:21,76
 away

32
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:28,111
5 And since they have been led away, these things

33
00:03:28,111 --> 00:03:34,254
 have been prophesied concerning them, and also

34
00:03:34,254 --> 00:03:40,397
 concerning all those who shall hereafter be scattered

35
00:03:40,397 --> 00:03:46,54
 and be confounded, because of the Holy One of

36
00:03:46,54 --> 00:03:52,683
 Israel; for against him will they harden their

37
00:03:52,683 --> 00:03:58,826
 hearts; wherefore, they shall be scattered among all

38
00:03:58,826 --> 00:04:04,969
 nations and shall be hated of all men

39
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:10,878
6 Nevertheless, after they shall be nursed by the

40
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:17,078
 Gentiles, and the Lord has lifted up his hand upon

41
00:04:17,078 --> 00:04:23,278
 the Gentiles and set them up for a standard, and

42
00:04:23,278 --> 00:04:29,478
 their children have been carried in their arms,

43
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:35,678
 and their daughters have been carried upon their

44
00:04:35,678 --> 00:04:41,878
 shoulders, behold these things of which are spoken

45
00:04:41,878 --> 00:04:48,078
 are temporal; for thus are the covenants of the Lord

46
00:04:48,078 --> 00:04:54,278
 with our fathers; and it meaneth us in the days

47
00:04:54,278 --> 00:05:00,478
 to come, and also all our brethren who are of the

48
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:06,678
 house of Israel

49
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:12,239
7 And it meaneth that the time cometh that after

50
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:18,239
 all the house of Israel have been scattered and

51
00:05:18,239 --> 00:05:24,239
 confounded, that the Lord God will raise up a mighty

52
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:30,239
 nation among the Gentiles, yea, even upon the face

53
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:36,239
 of this land; and by them shall our seed be

54
00:05:36,239 --> 00:05:42,239
 scattered

55
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:47,876
8 And after our seed is scattered the Lord God

56
00:05:47,876 --> 00:05:53,543
 will proceed to do a marvelous work among the

57
00:05:53,543 --> 00:05:59,21
 Gentiles, which shall be of great worth unto our seed;

58
00:05:59,21 --> 00:06:04,877
 wherefore, it is likened unto their being nourished

59
00:06:04,877 --> 00:06:10,544
 by the Gentiles and being carried in their arms

60
00:06:10,544 --> 00:06:16,211
 and upon their shoulders

61
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:22,743
9 And it shall also be of worth unto the Gentiles;

62
00:06:22,743 --> 00:06:29,243
 and not only unto the Gentiles but unto all the

63
00:06:29,243 --> 00:06:35,743
 house of Israel, unto the making known of the

64
00:06:35,743 --> 00:06:42,243
 covenants of the Father of heaven unto Abraham, saying:

65
00:06:42,243 --> 00:06:48,743
 In thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth

66
00:06:48,743 --> 00:06:55,243
 be blessed

67
00:06:55,682 --> 00:07:01,682
10 And I would, my brethren, that ye should know

68
00:07:01,682 --> 00:07:07,682
 that all the kindreds of the earth cannot be

69
00:07:07,682 --> 00:07:13,682
 blessed unless he shall make bare his arm in the eyes of

70
00:07:13,682 --> 00:07:19,682
 the nations

71
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:26,139
11 Wherefore, the Lord God will proceed to make

72
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:32,639
 bare his arm in the eyes of all the nations, in

73
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:39,139
 bringing about his covenants and his gospel unto those

74
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:45,639
 who are of the house of Israel

75
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:51,065
12 Wherefore, he will bring them again out of

76
00:07:51,065 --> 00:07:57,065
 captivity, and they shall be gathered together to the

77
00:07:57,065 --> 00:08:03,065
 lands of their inheritance; and they shall be

78
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:09,065
 brought out of obscurity and out of darkness; and they

79
00:08:09,065 --> 00:08:15,065
 shall know that the Lord is their Savior and

80
00:08:15,065 --> 00:08:21,065
 their Redeemer, the Mighty One of Israel

81
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:27,134
13 And the blood of that great and abominable

82
00:08:27,134 --> 00:08:33,134
 church, which is the whore of all the earth, shall

83
00:08:33,134 --> 00:08:39,134
 turn upon their own heads; for they shall war among

84
00:08:39,134 --> 00:08:45,134
 themselves, and the sword of their own hands shall

85
00:08:45,134 --> 00:08:51,134
 fall upon their own heads, and they shall be

86
00:08:51,134 --> 00:08:57,134
 drunken with their own blood

87
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:04,504
14 And every nation which shall war against thee,

88
00:09:04,504 --> 00:09:11,171
 O house of Israel, shall be turned one against

89
00:09:11,171 --> 00:09:17,838
 another, and they shall fall into the pit which they

90
00:09:17,838 --> 00:09:24,505
 digged to ensnare the people of the Lord. And all

91
00:09:24,505 --> 00:09:31,172
 that fight against Zion shall be destroyed, and

92
00:09:31,172 --> 00:09:37,839
 that great whore, who hath perverted the right ways

93
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:44,506
 of the Lord, yea, that great and abominable

94
00:09:44,506 --> 00:09:51,173
 church, shall tumble to the dust and great shall be the

95
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:57,84
 fall of it

96
00:09:57,564 --> 00:10:05,064
15 For behold, saith the prophet, the time cometh

97
00:10:05,064 --> 00:10:12,564
 speedily that Satan shall have no more power over

98
00:10:12,564 --> 00:10:20,064
 the hearts of the children of men; for the day

99
00:10:20,064 --> 00:10:27,564
 soon cometh that all the proud and they who do

100
00:10:27,564 --> 00:10:35,064
 wickedly shall be as stubble; and the day cometh that

101
00:10:35,064 --> 00:10:42,564
 they must be burned

102
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:48,525
16 For the time soon cometh that the fulness of

103
00:10:48,525 --> 00:10:54,275
 the wrath of God shall be poured out upon all the

104
00:10:54,275 --> 00:11:00,025
 children of men; for he will not suffer that the

105
00:11:00,025 --> 00:11:05,775
 wicked shall destroy the righteous

106
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:07,551
17 Wherefore, he will preserve the righteous by

107
00:11:07,551 --> 00:11:09,837
 his power, even if it so be that the fulness of his

108
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:12,123
 wrath must come, and the righteous be preserved,

109
00:11:12,123 --> 00:11:14,409
 even unto the destruction of their enemies by fire.

110
00:11:14,409 --> 00:11:16,695
 Wherefore, the righteous need not fear; for thus

111
00:11:16,695 --> 00:11:18,981
 saith the prophet, they shall be saved, even if it

112
00:11:18,981 --> 00:11:21,267
 so be as by fire

113
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:30,928
18 Behold, my brethren, I say unto you, that these

114
00:11:30,928 --> 00:11:40,642
 things must shortly come; yea, even blood, and

115
00:11:40,642 --> 00:11:50,356
 fire, and vapor of smoke must come; and it must

116
00:11:50,356 --> 00:12:00,07
 needs be upon the face of this earth; and it cometh

117
00:12:00,07 --> 00:12:09,784
 unto men according to the flesh if it so be that

118
00:12:09,784 --> 00:12:19,498
 they will harden their hearts against the Holy One of

119
00:12:19,498 --> 00:12:29,212
 Israel

120
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,715
19 For behold, the righteous shall not perish; for

121
00:12:31,715 --> 00:12:34,382
 the time surely must come that all they who fight

122
00:12:34,382 --> 00:12:37,049
 against Zion shall be cut off

123
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:44,148
20 And the Lord will surely prepare a way for his

124
00:12:44,148 --> 00:12:51,273
 people, unto the fulfilling of the words of Moses,

125
00:12:51,273 --> 00:12:58,398
 which he spake, saying: A prophet shall the Lord

126
00:12:58,398 --> 00:13:05,523
 your God raise up unto you, like unto me; him

127
00:13:05,523 --> 00:13:12,648
 shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say

128
00:13:12,648 --> 00:13:19,773
 unto you. And it shall come to pass that all those

129
00:13:19,773 --> 00:13:26,898
 who will not hear that prophet shall be cut off

130
00:13:26,898 --> 00:13:34,023
 from among the people

131
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:41,547
21 And now I, Nephi, declare unto you, that this

132
00:13:41,547 --> 00:13:48,547
 prophet of whom Moses spake was the Holy One of

133
00:13:48,547 --> 00:13:55,547
 Israel; wherefore, he shall execute judgment in

134
00:13:55,547 --> 00:14:02,547
 righteousness

135
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:07,375
22 And the righteous need not fear, for they are

136
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:12,175
 those who shall not be confounded. But it is the

137
00:14:12,175 --> 00:14:16,975
 kingdom of the devil, which shall be built up among

138
00:14:16,975 --> 00:14:21,775
 the children of men, which kingdom is established

139
00:14:21,775 --> 00:14:26,575
 among them which are in the flesh

140
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:33,999
23 For the time speedily shall come that all

141
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:41,666
 churches which are built up to get gain, and all those

142
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:49,333
 who are built up to get power over the flesh, and

143
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:57,0
 those who are built up to become popular in the

144
00:14:57,0 --> 00:15:04,667
 eyes of the world, and those who seek the lusts of

145
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:12,334
 the flesh and the things of the world, and to do

146
00:15:12,334 --> 00:15:20,001
 all manner of iniquity; yea, in fine, all those who

147
00:15:20,001 --> 00:15:27,668
 belong to the kingdom of the devil are they who

148
00:15:27,668 --> 00:15:35,335
 need fear, and tremble, and quake; they are those

149
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:43,002
 who must be brought low in the dust; they are those

150
00:15:43,002 --> 00:15:50,669
 who must be consumed as stubble; and this is

151
00:15:50,669 --> 00:15:58,336
 according to the words of the prophet

152
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:05,557
24 And the time cometh speedily that the righteous

153
00:16:05,557 --> 00:16:13,057
 must be led up as calves of the stall, and the

154
00:16:13,057 --> 00:16:20,557
 Holy One of Israel must reign in dominion, and

155
00:16:20,557 --> 00:16:28,057
 might, and power, and great glory

156
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:36,054
25 And he gathereth his children from the four

157
00:16:36,054 --> 00:16:43,454
 quarters of the earth; and he numbereth his sheep,

158
00:16:43,454 --> 00:16:50,854
 and they know him; and there shall be one fold and

159
00:16:50,854 --> 00:16:58,254
 one shepherd; and he shall feed his sheep, and in

160
00:16:58,254 --> 00:17:05,654
 him they shall find pasture

161
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:10,891
26 And because of the righteousness of his people,

162
00:17:10,891 --> 00:17:16,558
 Satan has no power; wherefore, he cannot be

163
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:22,225
 loosed for the space of many years; for he hath no

164
00:17:22,225 --> 00:17:27,892
 power over the hearts of the people, for they dwell in

165
00:17:27,892 --> 00:17:33,559
 righteousness, and the Holy One of Israel

166
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:39,226
 reigneth

167
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:47,725
27 And now behold, I, Nephi, say unto you that all

168
00:17:47,725 --> 00:17:55,725
 these things must come according to the flesh

169
00:17:55,207 --> 00:18:01,54
28 But, behold, all nations, kindreds, tongues,

170
00:18:01,54 --> 00:18:07,873
 and people shall dwell safely in the Holy One of

171
00:18:07,873 --> 00:18:14,206
 Israel if it so be that they will repent

172
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:20,194
29 And now I, Nephi, make an end; for I durst not

173
00:18:20,194 --> 00:18:25,694
 speak further as yet concerning these things

174
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:30,371
30 Wherefore, my brethren, I would that ye should

175
00:18:30,371 --> 00:18:34,971
 consider that the things which have been written

176
00:18:34,971 --> 00:18:39,571
 upon the plates of brass are true; and they testify

177
00:18:39,571 --> 00:18:44,171
 that a man must be obedient to the commandments

178
00:18:44,171 --> 00:18:48,771
 of God

179
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,194
31 Wherefore, ye need not suppose that I and my

180
00:18:50,194 --> 00:18:51,527
 father are the only ones that have testified, and

181
00:18:51,527 --> 00:18:52,86
 also taught them. Wherefore, if ye shall be obedient

182
00:18:52,86 --> 00:18:54,193
 to the commandments, and endure to the end, ye

183
00:18:54,193 --> 00:18:55,526
 shall be saved at the last day. And thus it is.

184
00:18:55,526 --> 00:18:56,859
 Amen.
