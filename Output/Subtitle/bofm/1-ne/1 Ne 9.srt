00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:30,959
Chapter 9 Nephi makes two sets of records—Each is

2
00:00:30,959 --> 00:00:35,959
 called the plates of Nephi—The larger plates

3
00:00:35,959 --> 00:00:40,959
 contain a secular history; the smaller ones deal

4
00:00:40,959 --> 00:00:45,959
 primarily with sacred things. About 600–592 B.C.

5
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:53,345
1 And all these things did my father see, and

6
00:00:53,345 --> 00:01:01,345
 hear, and speak, as he dwelt in a tent, in the valley

7
00:01:01,345 --> 00:01:09,345
 of Lemuel, and also a great many more things,

8
00:01:09,345 --> 00:01:17,345
 which cannot be written upon these plates

9
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:27,119
2 And now, as I have spoken concerning these

10
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:36,994
 plates, behold they are not the plates upon which I

11
00:01:36,994 --> 00:01:46,869
 make a full account of the history of my people; for

12
00:01:46,869 --> 00:01:56,744
 the plates upon which I make a full account of my

13
00:01:56,744 --> 00:02:06,619
 people I have given the name of Nephi; wherefore,

14
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:16,494
 they are called the plates of Nephi, after mine

15
00:02:16,494 --> 00:02:26,369
 own name; and these plates also are called the

16
00:02:26,369 --> 00:02:36,244
 plates of Nephi

17
00:02:36,99 --> 00:02:37,24
3 Nevertheless, I have received a commandment of

18
00:02:37,24 --> 00:02:37,49
 the Lord that I should make these plates, for the

19
00:02:37,49 --> 00:02:37,74
 special purpose that there should be an account

20
00:02:37,74 --> 00:02:37,99
 engraven of the ministry of my people

21
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:32,099
6 But the Lord knoweth all things from the

22
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:32,299
 beginning; wherefore, he prepareth a way to accomplish

23
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:32,499
 all his works among the children of men; for behold,

24
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:32,699
 he hath all power unto the fulfilling of all his

25
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:32,899
 words. And thus it is. Amen.
