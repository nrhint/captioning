00:00:00,634 --> 00:00:11,384
Chapter 20 The Lord reveals His purposes to

2
00:00:11,384 --> 00:00:22,134
 Israel—Israel has been chosen in the furnace of

3
00:00:22,134 --> 00:00:32,884
 affliction and is to go forth from Babylon—Compare 
Isaiah

4
00:00:32,884 --> 00:00:43,634
 48. About 588–570 B.C.

5
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:44,409
1 Hearken and hear this, O house of Jacob, who are

6
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:45,742
 called by the name of Israel, and are come forth

7
00:00:45,742 --> 00:00:47,075
 out of the waters of Judah, or out of the waters

8
00:00:47,075 --> 00:00:48,408
 of baptism, who swear by the name of the Lord, and

9
00:00:48,408 --> 00:00:49,741
 make mention of the God of Israel, yet they swear

10
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:51,074
 not in truth nor in righteousness

11
00:00:51,051 --> 00:01:05,301
2 Nevertheless, they call themselves of the holy

12
00:01:05,301 --> 00:01:19,551
 city, but they do not stay themselves upon the God

13
00:01:19,551 --> 00:01:33,801
 of Israel, who is the Lord of Hosts; yea, the Lord

14
00:01:33,801 --> 00:01:48,051
 of Hosts is his name

15
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:55,908
3 Behold, I have declared the former things from

16
00:01:55,908 --> 00:02:03,241
 the beginning; and they went forth out of my mouth,

17
00:02:03,241 --> 00:02:10,574
 and I showed them. I did show them suddenly

18
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:16,93
4 And I did it because I knew that thou art

19
00:02:16,93 --> 00:02:23,263
 obstinate, and thy neck is an iron sinew, and thy brow

20
00:02:23,263 --> 00:02:29,596
 brass

21
00:02:29,75 --> 00:02:37,35
5 And I have even from the beginning declared to

22
00:02:37,35 --> 00:02:44,95
 thee; before it came to pass I showed them thee;

23
00:02:44,95 --> 00:02:52,55
 and I showed them for fear lest thou shouldst

24
00:02:52,55 --> 00:03:00,15
 say—Mine idol hath done them, and my graven image, and

25
00:03:00,15 --> 00:03:07,75
 my molten image hath commanded them

26
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:13,971
6 Thou hast seen and heard all this; and will ye

27
00:03:13,971 --> 00:03:20,221
 not declare them? And that I have showed thee new

28
00:03:20,221 --> 00:03:26,471
 things from this time, even hidden things, and thou

29
00:03:26,471 --> 00:03:32,721
 didst not know them

30
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:38,145
7 They are created now, and not from the

31
00:03:38,145 --> 00:03:44,145
 beginning, even before the day when thou heardest them not

32
00:03:44,145 --> 00:03:50,145
 they were declared unto thee, lest thou shouldst

33
00:03:50,145 --> 00:03:56,145
 say—Behold I knew them

34
00:03:56,103 --> 00:04:03,853
8 Yea, and thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest

35
00:04:03,853 --> 00:04:11,603
 not; yea, from that time thine ear was not opened;

36
00:04:11,603 --> 00:04:19,353
 for I knew that thou wouldst deal very

37
00:04:19,353 --> 00:04:27,103
 treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb

38
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:34,201
9 Nevertheless, for my name’s sake will I defer

39
00:04:34,201 --> 00:04:40,868
 mine anger, and for my praise will I refrain from

40
00:04:40,868 --> 00:04:47,535
 thee, that I cut thee not off

41
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:53,654
10 For, behold, I have refined thee, I have chosen

42
00:04:53,654 --> 00:05:00,154
 thee in the furnace of affliction

43
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:09,434
11 For mine own sake, yea, for mine own sake will

44
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:18,101
 I do this, for I will not suffer my name to be

45
00:05:18,101 --> 00:05:26,768
 polluted, and I will not give my glory unto another

46
00:05:26,86 --> 00:05:32,193
12 Hearken unto me, O Jacob, and Israel my called,

47
00:05:32,193 --> 00:05:37,526
 for I am he; I am the first, and I am also the

48
00:05:37,526 --> 00:05:42,859
 last

49
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:48,142
13 Mine hand hath also laid the foundation of the

50
00:05:48,142 --> 00:05:53,475
 earth, and my right hand hath spanned the heavens.

51
00:05:53,475 --> 00:05:58,808
 I call unto them and they stand up together

52
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:07,425
14 All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; who

53
00:06:07,425 --> 00:06:16,092
 among them hath declared these things unto them? The

54
00:06:16,092 --> 00:06:24,759
 Lord hath loved him; yea, and he will fulfil his

55
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:33,426
 word which he hath declared by them; and he will do

56
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:42,093
 his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm shall come

57
00:06:42,093 --> 00:06:50,76
 upon the Chaldeans

58
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,81
15 Also, saith the Lord; I the Lord, yea, I have

59
00:06:52,81 --> 00:06:55,477
 spoken; yea, I have called him to declare, I have

60
00:06:55,477 --> 00:06:58,144
 brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous

61
00:06:58,118 --> 00:07:00,118
16 Come ye near unto me; I have not spoken in

62
00:07:00,118 --> 00:07:02,118
 secret; from the beginning, from the time that it was

63
00:07:02,118 --> 00:07:04,118
 declared have I spoken; and the Lord God, and his

64
00:07:04,118 --> 00:07:06,118
 Spirit, hath sent me

65
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:10,092
17 And thus saith the Lord, thy Redeemer, the Holy

66
00:07:10,092 --> 00:07:14,092
 One of Israel; I have sent him, the Lord thy God

67
00:07:14,092 --> 00:07:18,092
 who teacheth thee to profit, who leadeth thee by

68
00:07:18,092 --> 00:07:22,092
 the way thou shouldst go, hath done it

69
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:27,042
18 O that thou hadst hearkened to my

70
00:07:27,042 --> 00:07:32,042
 commandments—then had thy peace been as a river, and thy

71
00:07:32,042 --> 00:07:37,042
 righteousness as the waves of the sea

72
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:41,991
19 Thy seed also had been as the sand; the

73
00:07:41,991 --> 00:07:45,991
 offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof; his name

74
00:07:45,991 --> 00:07:49,991
 should not have been cut off nor destroyed from

75
00:07:49,991 --> 00:07:53,991
 before me

76
00:07:53,94 --> 00:08:01,94
20 Go ye forth of Babylon, flee ye from the

77
00:08:01,94 --> 00:08:09,94
 Chaldeans, with a voice of singing declare ye, tell

78
00:08:09,94 --> 00:08:17,94
 this, utter to the end of the earth; say ye: The Lord

79
00:08:17,94 --> 00:08:25,94
 hath redeemed his servant Jacob

80
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,839
21 And they thirsted not; he led them through the

81
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:33,839
 deserts; he caused the waters to flow out of the

82
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,839
 rock for them; he clave the rock also and the

83
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,839
 waters gushed out

84
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:42,121
22 And notwithstanding he hath done all this, and

85
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:42,454
 greater also, there is no peace, saith the Lord,

86
00:08:42,454 --> 00:08:42,787
 unto the wicked.
