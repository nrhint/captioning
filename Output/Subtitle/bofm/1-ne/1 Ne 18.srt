00:00:00,434 --> 00:00:09,059
Chapter 18 The ship is finished—The births of

2
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:17,684
 Jacob and Joseph are mentioned—The company embarks for

3
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:26,309
 the promised land—The sons of Ishmael and their

4
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:34,934
 wives join in revelry and rebellion—Nephi is bound,

5
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:43,559
 and the ship is driven back by a terrible

6
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:52,184
 tempest—Nephi is freed, and by his prayer the storm

7
00:00:52,184 --> 00:01:00,809
 ceases—The people arrive in the promised land. About

8
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:09,434
 591–589 B.C.

9
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:15,536
1 And it came to pass that they did worship the

10
00:01:15,536 --> 00:01:21,336
 Lord, and did go forth with me; and we did work

11
00:01:21,336 --> 00:01:27,136
 timbers of curious workmanship. And the Lord did show

12
00:01:27,136 --> 00:01:32,936
 me from time to time after what manner I should

13
00:01:32,936 --> 00:01:38,736
 work the timbers of the ship

14
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:44,698
2 Now I, Nephi, did not work the timbers after the

15
00:01:44,698 --> 00:01:50,531
 manner which was learned by men, neither did I

16
00:01:50,531 --> 00:01:56,364
 build the ship after the manner of men; but I did

17
00:01:56,364 --> 00:02:02,197
 build it after the manner which the Lord had shown

18
00:02:02,197 --> 00:02:08,03
 unto me; wherefore, it was not after the manner of

19
00:02:08,03 --> 00:02:13,863
 men

20
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:20,167
3 And I, Nephi, did go into the mount oft, and I

21
00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:26,5
 did pray oft unto the Lord; wherefore the Lord

22
00:02:26,5 --> 00:02:32,833
 showed unto me great things

23
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:37,952
4 And it came to pass that after I had finished

24
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:43,552
 the ship, according to the word of the Lord, my

25
00:02:43,552 --> 00:02:49,152
 brethren beheld that it was good, and that the

26
00:02:49,152 --> 00:02:54,752
 workmanship thereof was exceedingly fine; wherefore, they

27
00:02:54,752 --> 00:03:00,352
 did humble themselves again before the Lord

28
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:05,514
5 And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord

29
00:03:05,514 --> 00:03:10,181
 came unto my father, that we should arise and go

30
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:14,848
 down into the ship

31
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:21,15
6 And it came to pass that on the morrow, after we

32
00:03:21,15 --> 00:03:27,372
 had prepared all things, much fruits and meat

33
00:03:27,372 --> 00:03:33,594
 from the wilderness, and honey in abundance, and

34
00:03:33,594 --> 00:03:39,816
 provisions according to that which the Lord had

35
00:03:39,816 --> 00:03:46,038
 commanded us, we did go down into the ship, with all our

36
00:03:46,038 --> 00:03:52,26
 loading and our seeds, and whatsoever thing we

37
00:03:52,26 --> 00:03:58,482
 had brought with us, every one according to his age;

38
00:03:58,482 --> 00:04:04,704
 wherefore, we did all go down into the ship, with

39
00:04:04,704 --> 00:04:10,926
 our wives and our children

40
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:16,283
7 And now, my father had begat two sons in the

41
00:04:16,283 --> 00:04:22,283
 wilderness; the elder was called Jacob and the

42
00:04:22,283 --> 00:04:28,283
 younger Joseph

43
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:33,768
8 And it came to pass after we had all gone down

44
00:04:33,768 --> 00:04:39,368
 into the ship, and had taken with us our provisions

45
00:04:39,368 --> 00:04:44,968
 and things which had been commanded us, we did

46
00:04:44,968 --> 00:04:50,568
 put forth into the sea and were driven forth before

47
00:04:50,568 --> 00:04:56,168
 the wind towards the promised land

48
00:04:56,096 --> 00:05:02,221
9 And after we had been driven forth before the

49
00:05:02,221 --> 00:05:08,346
 wind for the space of many days, behold, my brethren

50
00:05:08,346 --> 00:05:14,471
 and the sons of Ishmael and also their wives

51
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:20,596
 began to make themselves merry, insomuch that they

52
00:05:20,596 --> 00:05:26,721
 began to dance, and to sing, and to speak with much

53
00:05:26,721 --> 00:05:32,846
 rudeness, yea, even that they did forget by what

54
00:05:32,846 --> 00:05:38,971
 power they had been brought thither; yea, they were

55
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:45,096
 lifted up unto exceeding rudeness

56
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:51,941
10 And I, Nephi, began to fear exceedingly lest

57
00:05:51,941 --> 00:05:58,37
 the Lord should be angry with us, and smite us

58
00:05:58,37 --> 00:06:04,799
 because of our iniquity, that we should be swallowed up

59
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:11,228
 in the depths of the sea; wherefore, I, Nephi,

60
00:06:11,228 --> 00:06:17,657
 began to speak to them with much soberness; but

61
00:06:17,657 --> 00:06:24,086
 behold they were angry with me, saying: We will not

62
00:06:24,086 --> 00:06:30,515
 that our younger brother shall be a ruler over us

63
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:31,79
11 And it came to pass that Laman and Lemuel did

64
00:06:31,79 --> 00:06:33,123
 take me and bind me with cords, and they did treat

65
00:06:33,123 --> 00:06:34,456
 me with much harshness; nevertheless, the Lord did

66
00:06:34,456 --> 00:06:35,789
 suffer it that he might show forth his power,

67
00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:37,122
 unto the fulfilling of his word which he had spoken

68
00:06:37,122 --> 00:06:38,455
 concerning the wicked

69
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:49,681
12 And it came to pass that after they had bound

70
00:06:49,681 --> 00:07:00,931
 me insomuch that I could not move, the compass,

71
00:07:00,931 --> 00:07:12,181
 which had been prepared of the Lord, did cease to

72
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:23,431
 work

73
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:28,857
13 Wherefore, they knew not whither they should

74
00:07:28,857 --> 00:07:34,571
 steer the ship, insomuch that there arose a great

75
00:07:34,571 --> 00:07:40,285
 storm, yea, a great and terrible tempest, and we

76
00:07:40,285 --> 00:07:45,999
 were driven back upon the waters for the space of

77
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:51,713
 three days; and they began to be frightened

78
00:07:51,713 --> 00:07:57,427
 exceedingly lest they should be drowned in the sea;

79
00:07:57,427 --> 00:08:03,141
 nevertheless they did not loose me

80
00:08:03,85 --> 00:08:09,85
14 And on the fourth day, which we had been driven

81
00:08:09,85 --> 00:08:15,85
 back, the tempest began to be exceedingly sore

82
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:21,013
15 And it came to pass that we were about to be

83
00:08:21,013 --> 00:08:26,831
 swallowed up in the depths of the sea. And after we

84
00:08:26,831 --> 00:08:32,649
 had been driven back upon the waters for the space

85
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:38,467
 of four days, my brethren began to see that the

86
00:08:38,467 --> 00:08:44,285
 judgments of God were upon them, and that they must

87
00:08:44,285 --> 00:08:50,103
 perish save that they should repent of their

88
00:08:50,103 --> 00:08:55,921
 iniquities; wherefore, they came unto me, and loosed

89
00:08:55,921 --> 00:09:01,739
 the bands which were upon my wrists, and behold

90
00:09:01,739 --> 00:09:07,557
 they had swollen exceedingly; and also mine ankles

91
00:09:07,557 --> 00:09:13,375
 were much swollen, and great was the soreness

92
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:19,193
 thereof

93
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:25,626
16 Nevertheless, I did look unto my God, and I did

94
00:09:25,626 --> 00:09:31,626
 praise him all the day long; and I did not murmur

95
00:09:31,626 --> 00:09:37,626
 against the Lord because of mine afflictions

96
00:09:37,61 --> 00:09:43,467
17 Now my father, Lehi, had said many things unto

97
00:09:43,467 --> 00:09:49,324
 them, and also unto the sons of Ishmael; but,

98
00:09:49,324 --> 00:09:55,181
 behold, they did breathe out much threatenings against

99
00:09:55,181 --> 00:10:01,038
 anyone that should speak for me; and my parents

100
00:10:01,038 --> 00:10:06,895
 being stricken in years, and having suffered much

101
00:10:06,895 --> 00:10:12,752
 grief because of their children, they were brought

102
00:10:12,752 --> 00:10:18,609
 down, yea, even upon their sick-beds

103
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:25,519
18 Because of their grief and much sorrow, and the

104
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:32,186
 iniquity of my brethren, they were brought near

105
00:10:32,186 --> 00:10:38,853
 even to be carried out of this time to meet their

106
00:10:38,853 --> 00:10:45,52
 God; yea, their grey hairs were about to be brought

107
00:10:45,52 --> 00:10:52,187
 down to lie low in the dust; yea, even they were

108
00:10:52,187 --> 00:10:58,854
 near to be cast with sorrow into a watery grave

109
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:03,591
19 And Jacob and Joseph also, being young, having

110
00:11:03,591 --> 00:11:08,924
 need of much nourishment, were grieved because of

111
00:11:08,924 --> 00:11:14,257
 the afflictions of their mother; and also my wife

112
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:19,59
 with her tears and prayers, and also my children,

113
00:11:19,59 --> 00:11:24,923
 did not soften the hearts of my brethren that they

114
00:11:24,923 --> 00:11:30,256
 would loose me

115
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:35,923
20 And there was nothing save it were the power of

116
00:11:35,923 --> 00:11:41,59
 God, which threatened them with destruction,

117
00:11:41,59 --> 00:11:47,257
 could soften their hearts; wherefore, when they saw

118
00:11:47,257 --> 00:11:52,924
 that they were about to be swallowed up in the

119
00:11:52,924 --> 00:11:58,591
 depths of the sea they repented of the thing which they

120
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:04,258
 had done, insomuch that they loosed me

121
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:09,723
21 And it came to pass after they had loosed me,

122
00:12:09,723 --> 00:12:15,223
 behold, I took the compass, and it did work whither

123
00:12:15,223 --> 00:12:20,723
 I desired it. And it came to pass that I prayed

124
00:12:20,723 --> 00:12:26,223
 unto the Lord; and after I had prayed the winds did

125
00:12:26,223 --> 00:12:31,723
 cease, and the storm did cease, and there was a

126
00:12:31,723 --> 00:12:37,223
 great calm

127
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:42,056
22 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did guide

128
00:12:42,056 --> 00:12:47,056
 the ship, that we sailed again towards the promised

129
00:12:47,056 --> 00:12:52,056
 land

130
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:57,071
23 And it came to pass that after we had sailed

131
00:12:57,071 --> 00:13:02,071
 for the space of many days we did arrive at the

132
00:13:02,071 --> 00:13:07,071
 promised land; and we went forth upon the land, and

133
00:13:07,071 --> 00:13:12,071
 did pitch our tents; and we did call it the promised

134
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:17,071
 land

135
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:22,763
24 And it came to pass that we did begin to till

136
00:13:22,763 --> 00:13:28,43
 the earth, and we began to plant seeds; yea, we did

137
00:13:28,43 --> 00:13:34,097
 put all our seeds into the earth, which we had

138
00:13:34,097 --> 00:13:39,764
 brought from the land of Jerusalem. And it came to

139
00:13:39,764 --> 00:13:45,431
 pass that they did grow exceedingly; wherefore, we

140
00:13:45,431 --> 00:13:51,098
 were blessed in abundance

141
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:54,814
25 And it came to pass that we did find upon the

142
00:13:54,814 --> 00:13:58,564
 land of promise, as we journeyed in the wilderness,

143
00:13:58,564 --> 00:14:02,314
 that there were beasts in the forests of every

144
00:14:02,314 --> 00:14:06,064
 kind, both the cow and the ox, and the ass and the

145
00:14:06,064 --> 00:14:09,814
 horse, and the goat and the wild goat, and all

146
00:14:09,814 --> 00:14:13,564
 manner of wild animals, which were for the use of men.

147
00:14:13,564 --> 00:14:17,314
 And we did find all manner of ore, both of gold,

148
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:21,064
 and of silver, and of copper.
