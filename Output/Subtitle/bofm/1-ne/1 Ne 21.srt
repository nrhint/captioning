00:00:00,4 --> 00:00:11,0
Chapter 21 The Messiah will be a light to the

2
00:00:11,0 --> 00:00:21,6
 Gentiles and will free the prisoners—Israel will be

3
00:00:21,6 --> 00:00:32,2
 gathered with power in the last days—Kings will be

4
00:00:32,2 --> 00:00:42,8
 their nursing fathers—Compare 
Isaiah 49. About

5
00:00:42,8 --> 00:00:53,4
 588–570 B.C.

6
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:54,142
1 And again: Hearken, O ye house of Israel, all ye

7
00:00:54,142 --> 00:00:55,031
 that are broken off and are driven out because of

8
00:00:55,031 --> 00:00:55,92
 the wickedness of the pastors of my people; yea,

9
00:00:55,92 --> 00:00:56,809
 all ye that are broken off, that are scattered

10
00:00:56,809 --> 00:00:57,698
 abroad, who are of my people, O house of Israel.

11
00:00:57,698 --> 00:00:58,587
 Listen, O isles, unto me, and hearken ye people from

12
00:00:58,587 --> 00:00:59,476
 far; the Lord hath called me from the womb; from

13
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:00,365
 the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my

14
00:01:00,365 --> 00:01:01,254
 name

15
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:06,561
2 And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in

16
00:01:06,561 --> 00:01:11,894
 the shadow of his hand hath he hid me, and made

17
00:01:11,894 --> 00:01:17,227
 me a polished shaft; in his quiver hath he hid me

18
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:20,177
3 And said unto me: Thou art my servant, O Israel,

19
00:01:20,177 --> 00:01:23,177
 in whom I will be glorified

20
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:29,317
4 Then I said, I have labored in vain, I have

21
00:01:29,317 --> 00:01:34,65
 spent my strength for naught and in vain; surely my

22
00:01:34,65 --> 00:01:39,983
 judgment is with the Lord, and my work with my God

23
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:43,133
5 And now, saith the Lord—that formed me from the

24
00:01:43,133 --> 00:01:46,333
 womb that I should be his servant, to bring Jacob

25
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:49,533
 again to him—though Israel be not gathered, yet

26
00:01:49,533 --> 00:01:52,733
 shall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord, and my

27
00:01:52,733 --> 00:01:55,933
 God shall be my strength

28
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:57,215
6 And he said: It is a light thing that thou

29
00:01:57,215 --> 00:01:58,548
 shouldst be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob,

30
00:01:58,548 --> 00:01:59,881
 and to restore the preserved of Israel. I will

31
00:01:59,881 --> 00:02:01,214
 also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that

32
00:02:01,214 --> 00:02:02,547
 thou mayest be my salvation unto the ends of the

33
00:02:02,547 --> 00:02:03,88
 earth

34
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:08,657
7 Thus saith the Lord, the Redeemer of Israel, his

35
00:02:08,657 --> 00:02:13,457
 Holy One, to him whom man despiseth, to him whom

36
00:02:13,457 --> 00:02:18,257
 the nations abhorreth, to servant of rulers: Kings

37
00:02:18,257 --> 00:02:23,057
 shall see and arise, princes also shall worship,

38
00:02:23,057 --> 00:02:27,857
 because of the Lord that is faithful

39
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:29,114
8 Thus saith the Lord: In an acceptable time have

40
00:02:29,114 --> 00:02:30,447
 I heard thee, O isles of the sea, and in a day of

41
00:02:30,447 --> 00:02:31,78
 salvation have I helped thee; and I will preserve

42
00:02:31,78 --> 00:02:33,113
 thee, and give thee my servant for a covenant of

43
00:02:33,113 --> 00:02:34,446
 the people, to establish the earth, to cause to

44
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:35,779
 inherit the desolate heritages

45
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:37,756
9 That thou mayest say to the prisoners: Go forth;

46
00:02:37,756 --> 00:02:39,756
 to them that sit in darkness: Show yourselves.

47
00:02:39,756 --> 00:02:41,756
 They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures

48
00:02:41,756 --> 00:02:43,756
 shall be in all high places

49
00:02:43,73 --> 00:02:49,73
10 They shall not hunger nor thirst, neither shall

50
00:02:49,73 --> 00:02:55,73
 the heat nor the sun smite them; for he that hath

51
00:02:55,73 --> 00:03:01,73
 mercy on them shall lead them, even by the

52
00:03:01,73 --> 00:03:07,73
 springs of water shall he guide them

53
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:11,654
11 And I will make all my mountains a way, and my

54
00:03:11,654 --> 00:03:15,654
 highways shall be exalted

55
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:18,296
12 And then, O house of Israel, behold, these

56
00:03:18,296 --> 00:03:20,963
 shall come from far; and lo, these from the north and

57
00:03:20,963 --> 00:03:23,63
 from the west; and these from the land of Sinim

58
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:24,936
13 Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; for

59
00:03:24,936 --> 00:03:26,269
 the feet of those who are in the east shall be

60
00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:27,602
 established; and break forth into singing, O mountains;

61
00:03:27,602 --> 00:03:28,935
 for they shall be smitten no more; for the Lord

62
00:03:28,935 --> 00:03:30,268
 hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon

63
00:03:30,268 --> 00:03:31,601
 his afflicted

64
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:34,245
14 But, behold, Zion hath said: The Lord hath

65
00:03:34,245 --> 00:03:36,912
 forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me—but he will

66
00:03:36,912 --> 00:03:39,579
 show that he hath not

67
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,553
15 For can a woman forget her sucking child, that

68
00:03:41,553 --> 00:03:43,553
 she should not have compassion on the son of her

69
00:03:43,553 --> 00:03:45,553
 womb? Yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget

70
00:03:45,553 --> 00:03:47,553
 thee, O house of Israel

71
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:55,527
16 Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my

72
00:03:55,527 --> 00:04:03,527
 hands; thy walls are continually before me

73
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:06,144
17 Thy children shall make haste against thy

74
00:04:06,144 --> 00:04:08,811
 destroyers; and they that made thee waste shall go

75
00:04:08,811 --> 00:04:11,478
 forth of thee

76
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,051
18 Lift up thine eyes round about and behold; all

77
00:04:13,051 --> 00:04:14,651
 these gather themselves together, and they shall

78
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:16,251
 come to thee. And as I live, saith the Lord, thou

79
00:04:16,251 --> 00:04:17,851
 shalt surely clothe thee with them all, as with an

80
00:04:17,851 --> 00:04:19,451
 ornament, and bind them on even as a bride

81
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:23,426
19 For thy waste and thy desolate places, and the

82
00:04:23,426 --> 00:04:27,426
 land of thy destruction, shall even now be too

83
00:04:27,426 --> 00:04:31,426
 narrow by reason of the inhabitants; and they that

84
00:04:31,426 --> 00:04:35,426
 swallowed thee up shall be far away

85
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:39,375
20 The children whom thou shalt have, after thou

86
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:43,375
 hast lost the first, shall again in thine ears say:

87
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:47,375
 The place is too strait for me; give place to me

88
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:51,375
 that I may dwell

89
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:52,924
21 Then shalt thou say in thine heart: Who hath

90
00:04:52,924 --> 00:04:54,524
 begotten me these, seeing I have lost my children,

91
00:04:54,524 --> 00:04:56,124
 and am desolate, a captive, and removing to and

92
00:04:56,124 --> 00:04:57,724
 fro? And who hath brought up these? Behold, I was

93
00:04:57,724 --> 00:04:59,324
 left alone; these, where have they been

94
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,499
22 Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will lift up

95
00:05:02,499 --> 00:05:05,699
 mine hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard

96
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:08,899
 to the people; and they shall bring thy sons in

97
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:12,099
 their arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon

98
00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:15,299
 their shoulders

99
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:16,581
23 And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and

100
00:05:16,581 --> 00:05:17,914
 their queens thy nursing mothers; they shall bow down

101
00:05:17,914 --> 00:05:19,247
 to thee with their face towards the earth, and

102
00:05:19,247 --> 00:05:20,58
 lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know

103
00:05:20,58 --> 00:05:21,913
 that I am the Lord; for they shall not be ashamed

104
00:05:21,913 --> 00:05:23,246
 that wait for me

105
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:31,223
24 For shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or

106
00:05:31,223 --> 00:05:39,223
 the lawful captives delivered

107
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,772
25 But thus saith the Lord, even the captives of

108
00:05:40,772 --> 00:05:42,372
 the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the

109
00:05:42,372 --> 00:05:43,972
 terrible shall be delivered; for I will contend

110
00:05:43,972 --> 00:05:45,572
 with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save

111
00:05:45,572 --> 00:05:47,172
 thy children

112
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:47,147
26 And I will feed them that oppress thee with

113
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:47,147
 their own flesh; they shall be drunken with their own

114
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:47,147
 blood as with sweet wine; and all flesh shall

115
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:47,147
 know that I, the Lord, am thy Savior and thy

116
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:47,147
 Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
