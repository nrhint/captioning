00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 4 Nephi slays Laban at the Lord’s

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
command and then secures the plates of brass

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
by stratagem—Zoram chooses to join Lehi’s

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:05:43,
family in the wilderness. About 600–592 B.C. 

5
00:05:43,0 --> 00:05:43,0
1 And it came to pass that I spake unto my

6
00:05:43,0 --> 00:05:43,0
brethren, saying: Let us go up again unto

7
00:05:43,0 --> 00:05:43,0
Jerusalem, and let us be faithful in

8
00:05:43,0 --> 00:05:43,0
keeping the commandments of the Lord; for

9
00:05:43,0 --> 00:05:43,0
behold he is mightier than all the earth, then

10
00:05:43,0 --> 00:05:43,0
why not mightier than Laban and his

11
00:05:43,0 --> 00:05:15,
fifty, yea, or even than his tens of thousands?

12
00:05:15,0 --> 00:05:15,0
2 Therefore let us go up; let us be

13
00:05:15,0 --> 00:05:15,0
strong like unto Moses; for he truly spake

14
00:05:15,0 --> 00:05:15,0
unto the waters of the Red Sea and they

15
00:05:15,0 --> 00:05:15,0
divided hither and thither, and our fathers

16
00:05:15,0 --> 00:05:15,0
came through, out of captivity, on dry

17
00:05:15,0 --> 00:05:15,0
ground, and the armies of Pharaoh did follow

18
00:05:15,0 --> 00:04:47,
and were drowned in the waters of the Red Sea.

19
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
3 Now behold ye know that this is

20
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
true; and ye also know that an angel hath

21
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
spoken unto you; wherefore can ye

22
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
doubt? Let us go up; the Lord is able to

23
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
deliver us, even as our fathers, and to

24
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,
destroy Laban, even as the Egyptians.

25
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
4 Now when I had spoken these

26
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
words, they were yet wroth, and did

27
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
still continue to murmur;

28
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
nevertheless they did follow me up until we

29
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,
came without the walls of Jerusalem.

30
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
5 And it was by night; and I

31
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
caused that they should hide

32
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
themselves without the walls. And

33
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
after they had hid themselves, I,

34
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
Nephi, crept into the city and

35
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,
went forth towards the house of Laban.

36
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
6 And I was led by the

37
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
Spirit, not knowing beforehand

38
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,
the things which I should do.

39
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
7 Nevertheless I went

40
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
forth, and as I came near unto

41
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
the house of Laban I

42
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
beheld a man, and he had

43
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
fallen to the earth before me,

44
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,
for he was drunken with wine.

45
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
8 And when I came to him

46
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,
I found that it was Laban.

47
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
9 And I beheld his

48
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
sword, and I drew it forth

49
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
from the sheath thereof;

50
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
and the hilt thereof was

51
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
of pure gold, and the

52
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
workmanship thereof was

53
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
exceedingly fine, and I

54
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
saw that the blade thereof

55
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,
was of the most precious steel.

56
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
10 And it came to pass

57
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
that I was constrained

58
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
by the Spirit that I

59
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
should kill Laban; but I

60
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
said in my heart: Never

61
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
at any time have I

62
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
shed the blood of man. And

63
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
I shrunk and would

64
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,
that I might not slay him.

65
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
11 And the Spirit

66
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
said unto me again:

67
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
Behold the Lord hath

68
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
delivered him into thy

69
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
hands. Yea, and I also

70
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
knew that he had

71
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
sought to take away mine

72
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
own life; yea, and he

73
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
would not hearken

74
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
unto the commandments

75
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
of the Lord; and he

76
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,
also had taken away our property.

77
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
12 And it came to

78
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
pass that the Spirit

79
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
said unto me

80
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
again: Slay him, for the

81
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
Lord hath

82
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,
delivered him into thy hands;

83
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
13 Behold the

84
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
Lord slayeth the

85
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
wicked to bring

86
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
forth his righteous

87
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
purposes. It is

88
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
better that one man

89
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
should perish

90
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
than that a nation

91
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
should dwindle

92
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,
and perish in unbelief.

93
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
14 And now, when

94
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
I, Nephi, had

95
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
heard these

96
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
words, I remembered

97
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
the words of the

98
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
Lord which he

99
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
spake unto me in

100
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
the wilderness,

101
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
saying that:

102
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
Inasmuch as thy seed

103
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
shall keep my

104
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
commandments,

105
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
they shall prosper

106
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,
in the land of promise.

107
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
15 Yea, and I

108
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
also thought

109
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
that they could

110
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
not keep the

111
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
commandments of the

112
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
Lord according

113
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
to the law of

114
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
Moses, save

115
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,
they should have the law.

116
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
16 And I also

117
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
knew that the

118
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
law was

119
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
engraven upon the

120
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,
plates of brass.

121
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
17 And again,

122
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
I knew that

123
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
the Lord had

124
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
delivered

125
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
Laban into my

126
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
hands for this

127
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
cause—that I

128
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
might obtain

129
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
the records

130
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
according to

131
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,
his commandments.

132
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
18 Therefore

133
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
I did obey

134
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
the voice of

135
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
the Spirit,

136
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
and took

137
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
Laban by the

138
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
hair of the

139
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
head, and I

140
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
smote off his

141
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
head with

142
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,
his own sword.

143
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
19 And

144
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
after I had

145
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
smitten off

146
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
his head with

147
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
his own

148
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
sword, I took

149
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
the

150
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
garments of Laban

151
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
and put

152
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
them upon

153
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
mine own body;

154
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
yea, even

155
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
every whit;

156
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
and I did

157
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
gird on his

158
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,
armor about my loins.

159
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
20 And

160
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
after I had

161
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
done this,

162
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
I went

163
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
forth unto

164
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
the treasury

165
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
of Laban.

166
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
And as I

167
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
went forth

168
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
towards

169
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
the

170
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
treasury of

171
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
Laban, behold,

172
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
I saw the

173
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
servant of

174
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
Laban who

175
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
had the

176
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
keys of the

177
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
treasury.

178
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
And I

179
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
commanded him

180
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
in the

181
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
voice of

182
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
Laban, that

183
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
he should

184
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,
go with me into the treasury.

185
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
21 And he

186
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
supposed

187
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
me to be

188
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
his

189
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
master,

190
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
Laban, for he

191
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
beheld

192
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
the

193
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
garments and

194
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
also the

195
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
sword girded

196
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,
about my loins.

197
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
22 And

198
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
he spake

199
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
unto me

200
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0


201
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
concerning the

202
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
elders of

203
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
the

204
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
Jews, he

205
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
knowing

206
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
that his

207
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
master,

208
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
Laban,

209
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
had been

210
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
out by

211
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,
night among them.

212
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
23 And I

213
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
spake

214
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
unto him

215
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
as if it

216
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
had

217
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,
been Laban.

218
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
24 And

219
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
I also

220
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
spake

221
00:04:47,0 --> 00:04:47,0
