00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:29,741
Chapter 4 Nephi slays Laban at the Lord’s command

2
00:00:29,741 --> 00:00:51,741
 and then secures the plates of brass by

3
00:00:51,741 --> 00:01:13,741
 stratagem—Zoram chooses to join Lehi’s family in the

4
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:35,741
 wilderness. About 600–592 B.C.

5
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:36,029
1 And it came to pass that I spake unto my

6
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:36,362
 brethren, saying: Let us go up again unto Jerusalem, and

7
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:36,695
 let us be faithful in keeping the commandments of

8
00:01:36,695 --> 00:01:37,028
 the Lord; for behold he is mightier than all the

9
00:01:37,028 --> 00:01:37,361
 earth, then why not mightier than Laban and his

10
00:01:37,361 --> 00:01:37,694
 fifty, yea, or even than his tens of thousands

11
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:43,364
2 Therefore let us go up; let us be strong like

12
00:01:43,364 --> 00:01:49,531
 unto Moses; for he truly spake unto the waters of

13
00:01:49,531 --> 00:01:55,698
 the Red Sea and they divided hither and thither, and

14
00:01:55,698 --> 00:02:01,865
 our fathers came through, out of captivity, on

15
00:02:01,865 --> 00:02:08,032
 dry ground, and the armies of Pharaoh did follow and

16
00:02:08,032 --> 00:02:14,199
 were drowned in the waters of the Red Sea

17
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:23,701
3 Now behold ye know that this is true; and ye

18
00:02:23,701 --> 00:02:32,901
 also know that an angel hath spoken unto you;

19
00:02:32,901 --> 00:02:42,101
 wherefore can ye doubt? Let us go up; the Lord is able to

20
00:02:42,101 --> 00:02:51,301
 deliver us, even as our fathers, and to destroy

21
00:02:51,301 --> 00:03:00,501
 Laban, even as the Egyptians

22
00:03:00,48 --> 00:03:10,23
4 Now when I had spoken these words, they were yet

23
00:03:10,23 --> 00:03:19,98
 wroth, and did still continue to murmur;

24
00:03:19,98 --> 00:03:29,73
 nevertheless they did follow me up until we came without

25
00:03:29,73 --> 00:03:39,48
 the walls of Jerusalem

26
00:03:39,753 --> 00:04:03,753
5 And it was by night; and I caused that they

27
00:04:03,753 --> 00:04:27,753
 should hide themselves without the walls. And after

28
00:04:27,753 --> 00:04:51,753
 they had hid themselves, I, Nephi, crept into the

29
00:04:51,753 --> 00:05:15,753
 city and went forth towards the house of Laban

30
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:23,448
6 And I was led by the Spirit, not knowing

31
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:31,448
 beforehand the things which I should do

32
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:35,398
7 Nevertheless I went forth, and as I came near

33
00:05:35,398 --> 00:05:39,398
 unto the house of Laban I beheld a man, and he had

34
00:05:39,398 --> 00:05:43,398
 fallen to the earth before me, for he was drunken

35
00:05:43,398 --> 00:05:47,398
 with wine

36
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:51,347
8 And when I came to him I found that it was

37
00:05:51,347 --> 00:05:55,347
 Laban

38
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:58,522
9 And I beheld his sword, and I drew it forth from

39
00:05:58,522 --> 00:06:01,722
 the sheath thereof; and the hilt thereof was of

40
00:06:01,722 --> 00:06:04,922
 pure gold, and the workmanship thereof was

41
00:06:04,922 --> 00:06:08,122
 exceedingly fine, and I saw that the blade thereof was of

42
00:06:08,122 --> 00:06:11,322
 the most precious steel

43
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:17,671
10 And it came to pass that I was constrained by

44
00:06:17,671 --> 00:06:24,071
 the Spirit that I should kill Laban; but I said in

45
00:06:24,071 --> 00:06:30,471
 my heart: Never at any time have I shed the blood

46
00:06:30,471 --> 00:06:36,871
 of man. And I shrunk and would that I might not

47
00:06:36,871 --> 00:06:43,271
 slay him

48
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:44,502
11 And the Spirit said unto me again: Behold the

49
00:06:44,502 --> 00:06:45,835
 Lord hath delivered him into thy hands. Yea, and I

50
00:06:45,835 --> 00:06:47,168
 also knew that he had sought to take away mine own

51
00:06:47,168 --> 00:06:48,501
 life; yea, and he would not hearken unto the

52
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:49,834
 commandments of the Lord; and he also had taken away

53
00:06:49,834 --> 00:06:51,167
 our property

54
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:56,477
12 And it came to pass that the Spirit said unto

55
00:06:56,477 --> 00:07:01,81
 me again: Slay him, for the Lord hath delivered him

56
00:07:01,81 --> 00:07:07,143
 into thy hands

57
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:07,093
13 Behold the Lord slayeth the wicked to bring

58
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:07,093
 forth his righteous purposes. It is better that one

59
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:07,093
 man should perish than that a nation should dwindle

60
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:07,093
 and perish in unbelief

61
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:09,427
14 And now, when I, Nephi, had heard these words,

62
00:07:09,427 --> 00:07:11,027
 I remembered the words of the Lord which he spake

63
00:07:11,027 --> 00:07:12,627
 unto me in the wilderness, saying that: Inasmuch

64
00:07:12,627 --> 00:07:14,227
 as thy seed shall keep my commandments, they shall

65
00:07:14,227 --> 00:07:15,827
 prosper in the land of promise

66
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:24,469
15 Yea, and I also thought that they could not

67
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:33,136
 keep the commandments of the Lord according to the

68
00:07:33,136 --> 00:07:41,803
 law of Moses, save they should have the law

69
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:47,361
16 And I also knew that the law was engraven upon

70
00:07:47,361 --> 00:07:52,861
 the plates of brass

71
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,606
17 And again, I knew that the Lord had delivered

72
00:07:55,606 --> 00:07:58,273
 Laban into my hands for this cause—that I might

73
00:07:58,273 --> 00:08:00,94
 obtain the records according to his commandments

74
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:10,247
18 Therefore I did obey the voice of the Spirit,

75
00:08:10,247 --> 00:08:19,58
 and took Laban by the hair of the head, and I smote

76
00:08:19,58 --> 00:08:28,913
 off his head with his own sword

77
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:36,141
19 And after I had smitten off his head with his

78
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:44,141
 own sword, I took the garments of Laban and put

79
00:08:44,141 --> 00:08:52,141
 them upon mine own body; yea, even every whit; and I

80
00:08:52,141 --> 00:09:00,141
 did gird on his armor about my loins

81
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:14,539
20 And after I had done this, I went forth unto

82
00:09:14,539 --> 00:09:29,039
 the treasury of Laban. And as I went forth towards

83
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:43,539
 the treasury of Laban, behold, I saw the servant of

84
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:58,039
 Laban who had the keys of the treasury. And I

85
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:12,539
 commanded him in the voice of Laban, that he should

86
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:27,039
 go with me into the treasury

87
00:10:27,76 --> 00:10:30,427
21 And he supposed me to be his master, Laban, for

88
00:10:30,427 --> 00:10:33,094
 he beheld the garments and also the sword girded

89
00:10:33,094 --> 00:10:35,761
 about my loins

90
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:38,402
22 And he spake unto me concerning the elders of

91
00:10:38,402 --> 00:10:41,069
 the Jews, he knowing that his master, Laban, had

92
00:10:41,069 --> 00:10:43,736
 been out by night among them

93
00:10:43,71 --> 00:10:51,71
23 And I spake unto him as if it had been Laban

94
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:55,684
24 And I also spake unto him that I should carry

95
00:10:55,684 --> 00:10:59,684
 the engravings, which were upon the plates of

96
00:10:59,684 --> 00:11:03,684
 brass, to my elder brethren, who were without the

97
00:11:03,684 --> 00:11:07,684
 walls

98
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:15,634
25 And I also bade him that he should follow me

99
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:15,941
26 And he, supposing that I spake of the brethren

100
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:16,274
 of the church, and that I was truly that Laban

101
00:11:16,274 --> 00:11:16,607
 whom I had slain, wherefore he did follow me

102
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:18,408
27 And he spake unto me many times concerning the

103
00:11:18,408 --> 00:11:20,741
 elders of the Jews, as I went forth unto my

104
00:11:20,741 --> 00:11:23,074
 brethren, who were without the walls

105
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:37,316
28 And it came to pass that when Laman saw me he

106
00:11:37,316 --> 00:11:51,516
 was exceedingly frightened, and also Lemuel and

107
00:11:51,516 --> 00:12:05,716
 Sam. And they fled from before my presence; for they

108
00:12:05,716 --> 00:12:19,916
 supposed it was Laban, and that he had slain me

109
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:34,116
 and had sought to take away their lives also

110
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:48,22
29 And it came to pass that I called after them,

111
00:12:48,22 --> 00:13:01,553
 and they did hear me; wherefore they did cease to

112
00:13:01,553 --> 00:13:14,886
 flee from my presence

113
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:24,761
30 And it came to pass that when the servant of

114
00:13:24,761 --> 00:13:34,761
 Laban beheld my brethren he began to tremble, and

115
00:13:34,761 --> 00:13:44,761
 was about to flee from before me and return to the

116
00:13:44,761 --> 00:13:54,761
 city of Jerusalem

117
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:58,634
31 And now I, Nephi, being a man large in stature,

118
00:13:58,634 --> 00:14:02,634
 and also having received much strength of the

119
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:06,634
 Lord, therefore I did seize upon the servant of

120
00:14:06,634 --> 00:14:10,634
 Laban, and held him, that he should not flee

121
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:14,583
32 And it came to pass that I spake with him, that

122
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:18,583
 if he would hearken unto my words, as the Lord

123
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:22,583
 liveth, and as I live, even so that if he would

124
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:26,583
 hearken unto our words, we would spare his life

125
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,532
33 And I spake unto him, even with an oath, that

126
00:14:28,532 --> 00:14:30,532
 he need not fear; that he should be a free man like

127
00:14:30,532 --> 00:14:32,532
 unto us if he would go down in the wilderness

128
00:14:32,532 --> 00:14:34,532
 with us

129
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:34,674
34 And I also spake unto him, saying: Surely the

130
00:14:34,674 --> 00:14:34,841
 Lord hath commanded us to do this thing; and shall

131
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:35,008
 we not be diligent in keeping the commandments of

132
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:35,175
 the Lord? Therefore, if thou wilt go down into the

133
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:35,342
 wilderness to my father thou shalt have place

134
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:35,509
 with us

135
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:39,007
35 And it came to pass that Zoram did take courage

136
00:14:39,007 --> 00:14:42,84
 at the words which I spake. Now Zoram was the

137
00:14:42,84 --> 00:14:46,673
 name of the servant; and he promised that he would go

138
00:14:46,673 --> 00:14:50,506
 down into the wilderness unto our father. Yea,

139
00:14:50,506 --> 00:14:54,339
 and he also made an oath unto us that he would tarry

140
00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:58,172
 with us from that time forth

141
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:03,564
36 Now we were desirous that he should tarry with

142
00:15:03,564 --> 00:15:09,064
 us for this cause, that the Jews might not know

143
00:15:09,064 --> 00:15:14,564
 concerning our flight into the wilderness, lest they

144
00:15:14,564 --> 00:15:20,064
 should pursue us and destroy us

145
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:24,686
37 And it came to pass that when Zoram had made an

146
00:15:24,686 --> 00:15:29,019
 oath unto us, our fears did cease concerning him

147
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:33,352


148
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:38,916
38 And it came to pass that we took the plates of

149
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:44,666
 brass and the servant of Laban, and departed into

150
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:50,416
 the wilderness, and journeyed unto the tent of our

151
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:56,166
 father.
