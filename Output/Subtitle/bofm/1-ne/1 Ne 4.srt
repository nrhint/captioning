00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:06,5
Chapter 4 Nephi slays Laban at the Lord’s

2
00:00:06,5 --> 00:00:13,0
command and then secures the plates of brass

3
00:00:13,0 --> 00:00:19,5
by stratagem—Zoram chooses to join Lehi’s

4
00:00:19,5 --> 00:00:26,326
family in the wilderness. About 600–592 B.C. 

5
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:27,755
1 And it came to pass that I spake unto my

6
00:00:27,755 --> 00:00:29,184
brethren, saying: Let us go up again unto

7
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:30,613
Jerusalem, and let us be faithful in

8
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:32,042
keeping the commandments of the Lord; for

9
00:00:32,042 --> 00:00:33,471
behold he is mightier than all the earth, then

10
00:00:33,471 --> 00:00:34,9
why not mightier than Laban and his

11
00:00:34,9 --> 00:00:36,236
fifty, yea, or even than his tens of thousands?

12
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:37,093
2 Therefore let us go up; let us be

13
00:00:37,093 --> 00:00:37,95
strong like unto Moses; for he truly spake

14
00:00:37,95 --> 00:00:38,807
unto the waters of the Red Sea and they

15
00:00:38,807 --> 00:00:39,664
divided hither and thither, and our fathers

16
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:40,521
came through, out of captivity, on dry

17
00:00:40,521 --> 00:00:41,378
ground, and the armies of Pharaoh did follow

18
00:00:41,378 --> 00:00:42,109
and were drowned in the waters of the Red Sea.

19
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:44,276
3 Now behold ye know that this is

20
00:00:44,276 --> 00:00:46,443
true; and ye also know that an angel hath

21
00:00:46,443 --> 00:00:48,61
spoken unto you; wherefore can ye

22
00:00:48,61 --> 00:00:50,777
doubt? Let us go up; the Lord is able to

23
00:00:50,777 --> 00:00:52,944
deliver us, even as our fathers, and to

24
00:00:52,944 --> 00:00:55,455
destroy Laban, even as the Egyptians.

25
00:00:55,455 --> 00:01:01,455
4 Now when I had spoken these

26
00:01:01,455 --> 00:01:07,455
words, they were yet wroth, and did

27
00:01:07,455 --> 00:01:13,455
still continue to murmur;

28
00:01:13,455 --> 00:01:19,455
nevertheless they did follow me up until we

29
00:01:19,455 --> 00:01:25,686
came without the walls of Jerusalem.

30
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:25,519
5 And it was by night; and I

31
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:25,352
caused that they should hide

32
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:25,185
themselves without the walls. And

33
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:25,018
after they had hid themselves, I,

34
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:24,851
Nephi, crept into the city and

35
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:24,751
went forth towards the house of Laban.

36
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:24,418
6 And I was led by the

37
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:24,085
Spirit, not knowing beforehand

38
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:23,817
the things which I should do.

39
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:26,817
7 Nevertheless I went

40
00:01:26,817 --> 00:01:29,817
forth, and as I came near unto

41
00:01:29,817 --> 00:01:32,817
the house of Laban I

42
00:01:32,817 --> 00:01:35,817
beheld a man, and he had

43
00:01:35,817 --> 00:01:38,817
fallen to the earth before me,

44
00:01:38,817 --> 00:01:41,668
for he was drunken with wine.

45
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:49,668
8 And when I came to him

46
00:01:49,668 --> 00:01:57,117
I found that it was Laban.

47
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:57,228
9 And I beheld his

48
00:01:57,228 --> 00:01:57,339
sword, and I drew it forth

49
00:01:57,339 --> 00:01:57,45
from the sheath thereof;

50
00:01:57,45 --> 00:01:57,561
and the hilt thereof was

51
00:01:57,561 --> 00:01:57,672
of pure gold, and the

52
00:01:57,672 --> 00:01:57,783
workmanship thereof was

53
00:01:57,783 --> 00:01:57,894
exceedingly fine, and I

54
00:01:57,894 --> 00:01:58,005
saw that the blade thereof

55
00:01:58,005 --> 00:01:58,118
was of the most precious steel.

56
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,34
10 And it came to pass

57
00:01:59,34 --> 00:02:00,562
that I was constrained

58
00:02:00,562 --> 00:02:01,784
by the Spirit that I

59
00:02:01,784 --> 00:02:03,006
should kill Laban; but I

60
00:02:03,006 --> 00:02:04,228
said in my heart: Never

61
00:02:04,228 --> 00:02:05,45
at any time have I

62
00:02:05,45 --> 00:02:06,672
shed the blood of man. And

63
00:02:06,672 --> 00:02:07,894
I shrunk and would

64
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:09,529
that I might not slay him.

65
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:11,112
11 And the Spirit

66
00:02:11,112 --> 00:02:12,695
said unto me again:

67
00:02:12,695 --> 00:02:14,278
Behold the Lord hath

68
00:02:14,278 --> 00:02:15,861
delivered him into thy

69
00:02:15,861 --> 00:02:17,444
hands. Yea, and I also

70
00:02:17,444 --> 00:02:19,027
knew that he had

71
00:02:19,027 --> 00:02:20,61
sought to take away mine

72
00:02:20,61 --> 00:02:22,193
own life; yea, and he

73
00:02:22,193 --> 00:02:23,776
would not hearken

74
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:25,359
unto the commandments

75
00:02:25,359 --> 00:02:26,942
of the Lord; and he

76
00:02:26,942 --> 00:02:28,949
also had taken away our property.

77
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:30,616
12 And it came to

78
00:02:30,616 --> 00:02:32,283
pass that the Spirit

79
00:02:32,283 --> 00:02:33,95
said unto me

80
00:02:33,95 --> 00:02:35,617
again: Slay him, for the

81
00:02:35,617 --> 00:02:37,284
Lord hath

82
00:02:37,284 --> 00:02:38,859
delivered him into thy hands;

83
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:38,959
13 Behold the

84
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:39,059
Lord slayeth the

85
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:39,159
wicked to bring

86
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:39,259
forth his righteous

87
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:39,359
purposes. It is

88
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:39,459
better that one man

89
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:39,559
should perish

90
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:39,659
than that a nation

91
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:39,759
should dwindle

92
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:39,86
and perish in unbelief.

93
00:02:39,86 --> 00:02:40,503
14 And now, when

94
00:02:40,503 --> 00:02:41,146
I, Nephi, had

95
00:02:41,146 --> 00:02:41,789
heard these

96
00:02:41,789 --> 00:02:42,432
words, I remembered

97
00:02:42,432 --> 00:02:43,075
the words of the

98
00:02:43,075 --> 00:02:43,718
Lord which he

99
00:02:43,718 --> 00:02:44,361
spake unto me in

100
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:45,004
the wilderness,

101
00:02:45,004 --> 00:02:45,647
saying that:

102
00:02:45,647 --> 00:02:46,29
Inasmuch as thy seed

103
00:02:46,29 --> 00:02:46,933
shall keep my

104
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:47,576
commandments,

105
00:02:47,576 --> 00:02:48,219
they shall prosper

106
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:48,835
in the land of promise.

107
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:49,613
15 Yea, and I

108
00:02:49,613 --> 00:02:50,391
also thought

109
00:02:50,391 --> 00:02:51,169
that they could

110
00:02:51,169 --> 00:02:51,947
not keep the

111
00:02:51,947 --> 00:02:52,725
commandments of the

112
00:02:52,725 --> 00:02:53,503
Lord according

113
00:02:53,503 --> 00:02:54,281
to the law of

114
00:02:54,281 --> 00:02:55,059
Moses, save

115
00:02:55,059 --> 00:02:55,876
they should have the law.

116
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:55,676
16 And I also

117
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:55,476
knew that the

118
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:55,276
law was

119
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:55,076
engraven upon the

120
00:02:55,076 --> 00:02:54,941
plates of brass.

121
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:55,396
17 And again,

122
00:02:55,396 --> 00:02:55,851
I knew that

123
00:02:55,851 --> 00:02:56,306
the Lord had

124
00:02:56,306 --> 00:02:56,761
delivered

125
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:57,216
Laban into my

126
00:02:57,216 --> 00:02:57,671
hands for this

127
00:02:57,671 --> 00:02:58,126
cause—that I

128
00:02:58,126 --> 00:02:58,581
might obtain

129
00:02:58,581 --> 00:02:59,036
the records

130
00:02:59,036 --> 00:02:59,491
according to

131
00:02:59,491 --> 00:02:59,346
his commandments.

132
00:02:59,346 --> 00:02:59,255
18 Therefore

133
00:02:59,255 --> 00:02:59,164
I did obey

134
00:02:59,164 --> 00:02:59,073
the voice of

135
00:02:59,073 --> 00:02:58,982
the Spirit,

136
00:02:58,982 --> 00:02:58,891
and took

137
00:02:58,891 --> 00:02:58,8
Laban by the

138
00:02:58,8 --> 00:02:58,709
hair of the

139
00:02:58,709 --> 00:02:58,618
head, and I

140
00:02:58,618 --> 00:02:58,527
smote off his

141
00:02:58,527 --> 00:02:58,436
head with

142
00:02:58,436 --> 00:02:58,412
his own sword.

143
00:02:58,412 --> 00:02:58,35
19 And

144
00:02:58,35 --> 00:02:58,288
after I had

145
00:02:58,288 --> 00:02:58,226
smitten off

146
00:02:58,226 --> 00:02:58,164
his head with

147
00:02:58,164 --> 00:02:58,102
his own

148
00:02:58,102 --> 00:02:58,04
sword, I took

149
00:02:58,04 --> 00:02:57,978
the

150
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:57,916
garments of Laban

151
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:57,854
and put

152
00:02:57,854 --> 00:02:57,792
them upon

153
00:02:57,792 --> 00:02:57,73
mine own body;

154
00:02:57,73 --> 00:02:57,668
yea, even

155
00:02:57,668 --> 00:02:57,606
every whit;

156
00:02:57,606 --> 00:02:57,544
and I did

157
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:57,482
gird on his

158
00:02:57,482 --> 00:02:57,477
armor about my loins.

159
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:57,439
20 And

160
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:57,401
after I had

161
00:02:57,401 --> 00:02:57,363
done this,

162
00:02:57,363 --> 00:02:57,325
I went

163
00:02:57,325 --> 00:02:57,287
forth unto

164
00:02:57,287 --> 00:02:57,249
the treasury

165
00:02:57,249 --> 00:02:57,211
of Laban.

166
00:02:57,211 --> 00:02:57,173
And as I

167
00:02:57,173 --> 00:02:57,135
went forth

168
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:57,097
towards

169
00:02:57,097 --> 00:02:57,059
the

170
00:02:57,059 --> 00:02:57,021
treasury of

171
00:02:57,021 --> 00:02:56,983
Laban, behold,

172
00:02:56,983 --> 00:02:56,945
I saw the

173
00:02:56,945 --> 00:02:56,907
servant of

174
00:02:56,907 --> 00:02:56,869
Laban who

175
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:56,831
had the

176
00:02:56,831 --> 00:02:56,793
keys of the

177
00:02:56,793 --> 00:02:56,755
treasury.

178
00:02:56,755 --> 00:02:56,717
And I

179
00:02:56,717 --> 00:02:56,679
commanded him

180
00:02:56,679 --> 00:02:56,641
in the

181
00:02:56,641 --> 00:02:56,603
voice of

182
00:02:56,603 --> 00:02:56,565
Laban, that

183
00:02:56,565 --> 00:02:56,527
he should

184
00:02:56,527 --> 00:02:56,543
go with me into the treasury.

185
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:56,626
21 And he

186
00:02:56,626 --> 00:02:56,709
supposed

187
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:56,792
me to be

188
00:02:56,792 --> 00:02:56,875
his

189
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:56,958
master,

190
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:57,041
Laban, for he

191
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:57,124
beheld

192
00:02:57,124 --> 00:02:57,207
the

193
00:02:57,207 --> 00:02:57,29
garments and

194
00:02:57,29 --> 00:02:57,373
also the

195
00:02:57,373 --> 00:02:57,456
sword girded

196
00:02:57,456 --> 00:02:57,01
about my loins.

197
00:02:57,01 --> 00:02:57,477
22 And

198
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:57,944
he spake

199
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:58,411
