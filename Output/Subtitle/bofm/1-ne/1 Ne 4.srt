00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:37,074
Chapter 4 Nephi slays Laban at the Lord’s command and 

2
00:00:37,074 --> 00:01:06,408
then secures the plates of brass by stratagem—Zoram chooses to 

3
00:01:06,408 --> 00:01:35,741
join Lehi’s family in the wilderness. About 600–592 B.C.  

4
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:36,029
1 And it came to pass that I spake unto 

5
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:36,362
my brethren, saying: Let us go up again unto Jerusalem, 

6
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:36,696
and let us be faithful in keeping the commandments of 

7
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:37,029
the Lord; for behold he is mightier than all the 

8
00:01:37,029 --> 00:01:37,362
earth, then why not mightier than Laban and his fifty, 

9
00:01:37,362 --> 00:01:37,696
yea, or even than his tens of thousands? 

10
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:43,364
2 Therefore let us go up; let us be strong 

11
00:01:43,364 --> 00:01:49,53
like unto Moses; for he truly spake unto the waters 

12
00:01:49,53 --> 00:01:55,697
of the Red Sea and they divided hither and thither, 

13
00:01:55,697 --> 00:02:01,864
and our fathers came through, out of captivity, on dry 

14
00:02:01,864 --> 00:02:08,03
ground, and the armies of Pharaoh did follow and were 

15
00:02:08,03 --> 00:02:14,197
drowned in the waters of the Red Sea. 

16
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:23,701
3 Now behold ye know that this is true; and 

17
00:02:23,701 --> 00:02:32,901
ye also know that an angel hath spoken unto you; 

18
00:02:32,901 --> 00:02:42,101
wherefore can ye doubt? Let us go up; the Lord 

19
00:02:42,101 --> 00:02:51,301
is able to deliver us, even as our fathers, and 

20
00:02:51,301 --> 00:03:00,501
to destroy Laban, even as the Egyptians. 

21
00:03:00,48 --> 00:03:10,23
4 Now when I had spoken these words, they were 

22
00:03:10,23 --> 00:03:19,98
yet wroth, and did still continue to murmur; nevertheless they 

23
00:03:19,98 --> 00:03:29,73
did follow me up until we came without the walls 

24
00:03:29,73 --> 00:03:39,48
of Jerusalem. 

25
00:03:39,753 --> 00:04:03,753
5 And it was by night; and I caused that 

26
00:04:03,753 --> 00:04:27,753
they should hide themselves without the walls. And after they 

27
00:04:27,753 --> 00:04:51,753
had hid themselves, I, Nephi, crept into the city and 

28
00:04:51,753 --> 00:05:15,753
went forth towards the house of Laban. 

29
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:23,448
6 And I was led by the Spirit, not knowing 

30
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:31,448
beforehand the things which I should do. 

31
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:35,398
7 Nevertheless I went forth, and as I came near 

32
00:05:35,398 --> 00:05:39,398
unto the house of Laban I beheld a man, and 

33
00:05:39,398 --> 00:05:43,398
he had fallen to the earth before me, for he 

34
00:05:43,398 --> 00:05:47,398
was drunken with wine. 

35
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:51,347
8 And when I came to him I found that 

36
00:05:51,347 --> 00:05:55,347
it was Laban. 

37
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:58,522
9 And I beheld his sword, and I drew it 

38
00:05:58,522 --> 00:06:01,722
forth from the sheath thereof; and the hilt thereof was 

39
00:06:01,722 --> 00:06:04,922
of pure gold, and the workmanship thereof was exceedingly fine, 

40
00:06:04,922 --> 00:06:08,122
and I saw that the blade thereof was of the 

41
00:06:08,122 --> 00:06:11,322
most precious steel. 

42
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:17,671
10 And it came to pass that I was constrained 

43
00:06:17,671 --> 00:06:24,071
by the Spirit that I should kill Laban; but I 

44
00:06:24,071 --> 00:06:30,471
said in my heart: Never at any time have I 

45
00:06:30,471 --> 00:06:36,871
shed the blood of man. And I shrunk and would 

46
00:06:36,871 --> 00:06:43,271
that I might not slay him. 

47
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:44,503
11 And the Spirit said unto me again: Behold the 

48
00:06:44,503 --> 00:06:45,836
Lord hath delivered him into thy hands. Yea, and I 

49
00:06:45,836 --> 00:06:47,169
also knew that he had sought to take away mine 

50
00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:48,503
own life; yea, and he would not hearken unto the 

51
00:06:48,503 --> 00:06:49,836
commandments of the Lord; and he also had taken away 

52
00:06:49,836 --> 00:06:51,169
our property. 

53
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:56,477
12 And it came to pass that the Spirit said 

54
00:06:56,477 --> 00:07:01,811
unto me again: Slay him, for the Lord hath delivered 

55
00:07:01,811 --> 00:07:07,144
him into thy hands; 

56
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:07,093
13 Behold the Lord slayeth the wicked to bring forth 

57
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:07,093
his righteous purposes. It is better that one man should 

58
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:07,093
perish than that a nation should dwindle and perish in 

59
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:07,093
unbelief. 

60
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:09,427
14 And now, when I, Nephi, had heard these words, 

61
00:07:09,427 --> 00:07:11,027
I remembered the words of the Lord which he spake 

62
00:07:11,027 --> 00:07:12,627
unto me in the wilderness, saying that: Inasmuch as thy 

63
00:07:12,627 --> 00:07:14,227
seed shall keep my commandments, they shall prosper in the 

64
00:07:14,227 --> 00:07:15,827
land of promise. 

65
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:24,469
15 Yea, and I also thought that they could not 

66
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:33,135
keep the commandments of the Lord according to the law 

67
00:07:33,135 --> 00:07:41,802
of Moses, save they should have the law. 

68
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:47,361
16 And I also knew that the law was engraven 

69
00:07:47,361 --> 00:07:52,861
upon the plates of brass. 

70
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,606
17 And again, I knew that the Lord had delivered 

71
00:07:55,606 --> 00:07:58,272
Laban into my hands for this cause—that I might obtain 

72
00:07:58,272 --> 00:08:00,939
the records according to his commandments. 

73
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:10,247
18 Therefore I did obey the voice of the Spirit, 

74
00:08:10,247 --> 00:08:19,58
and took Laban by the hair of the head, and 

75
00:08:19,58 --> 00:08:28,914
I smote off his head with his own sword. 

76
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:36,141
19 And after I had smitten off his head with 

77
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:44,141
his own sword, I took the garments of Laban and 

78
00:08:44,141 --> 00:08:52,141
put them upon mine own body; yea, even every whit; 

79
00:08:52,141 --> 00:09:00,141
and I did gird on his armor about my loins. 

80
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:14,539
20 And after I had done this, I went forth 

81
00:09:14,539 --> 00:09:29,039
unto the treasury of Laban. And as I went forth 

82
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:43,539
towards the treasury of Laban, behold, I saw the servant 

83
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:58,039
of Laban who had the keys of the treasury. And 

84
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:12,539
I commanded him in the voice of Laban, that he 

85
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:27,039
should go with me into the treasury. 

86
00:10:27,76 --> 00:10:30,427
21 And he supposed me to be his master, Laban, 

87
00:10:30,427 --> 00:10:33,094
for he beheld the garments and also the sword girded 

88
00:10:33,094 --> 00:10:35,76
about my loins. 

89
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:38,402
22 And he spake unto me concerning the elders of 

90
00:10:38,402 --> 00:10:41,068
the Jews, he knowing that his master, Laban, had been 

91
00:10:41,068 --> 00:10:43,735
out by night among them. 

92
00:10:43,71 --> 00:10:47,71
23 And I spake unto him as if it had 

93
00:10:47,71 --> 00:10:51,71
been Laban. 

94
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:57,018
24 And I also spake unto him that I should 

95
00:10:57,018 --> 00:11:02,351
carry the engravings, which were upon the plates of brass, 

96
00:11:02,351 --> 00:11:07,684
to my elder brethren, who were without the walls. 

97
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:11,634
25 And I also bade him that he should follow 

98
00:11:11,634 --> 00:11:15,634
me. 

99
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:15,942
26 And he, supposing that I spake of the brethren 

100
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:16,275
of the church, and that I was truly that Laban 

101
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:16,608
whom I had slain, wherefore he did follow me. 

102
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:18,409
27 And he spake unto me many times concerning the 

103
00:11:18,409 --> 00:11:20,742
elders of the Jews, as I went forth unto my 

104
00:11:20,742 --> 00:11:23,075
brethren, who were without the walls. 

105
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:37,316
28 And it came to pass that when Laman saw 

106
00:11:37,316 --> 00:11:51,516
me he was exceedingly frightened, and also Lemuel and Sam. 

107
00:11:51,516 --> 00:12:05,716
And they fled from before my presence; for they supposed 

108
00:12:05,716 --> 00:12:19,916
it was Laban, and that he had slain me and 

109
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:34,116
had sought to take away their lives also. 

110
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:48,221
29 And it came to pass that I called after 

111
00:12:48,221 --> 00:13:01,554
them, and they did hear me; wherefore they did cease 

112
00:13:01,554 --> 00:13:14,887
to flee from my presence. 

113
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:24,761
30 And it came to pass that when the servant 

114
00:13:24,761 --> 00:13:34,761
of Laban beheld my brethren he began to tremble, and 

115
00:13:34,761 --> 00:13:44,761
was about to flee from before me and return to 

116
00:13:44,761 --> 00:13:54,761
the city of Jerusalem. 

117
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:58,634
31 And now I, Nephi, being a man large in 

118
00:13:58,634 --> 00:14:02,634
stature, and also having received much strength of the Lord, 

119
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:06,634
therefore I did seize upon the servant of Laban, and 

120
00:14:06,634 --> 00:14:10,634
held him, that he should not flee. 

121
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,783
32 And it came to pass that I spake with 

122
00:14:13,783 --> 00:14:16,983
him, that if he would hearken unto my words, as 

123
00:14:16,983 --> 00:14:20,183
the Lord liveth, and as I live, even so that 

124
00:14:20,183 --> 00:14:23,383
if he would hearken unto our words, we would spare 

125
00:14:23,383 --> 00:14:26,583
his life. 

126
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,532
33 And I spake unto him, even with an oath, 

127
00:14:28,532 --> 00:14:30,532
that he need not fear; that he should be a 

128
00:14:30,532 --> 00:14:32,532
free man like unto us if he would go down 

129
00:14:32,532 --> 00:14:34,532
in the wilderness with us. 

130
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:34,707
34 And I also spake unto him, saying: Surely the 

131
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:34,907
Lord hath commanded us to do this thing; and shall 

132
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:35,107
we not be diligent in keeping the commandments of the 

133
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:35,307
Lord? Therefore, if thou wilt go down into the wilderness 

134
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:35,507
to my father thou shalt have place with us. 

135
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:39,008
35 And it came to pass that Zoram did take 

136
00:14:39,008 --> 00:14:42,841
courage at the words which I spake. Now Zoram was 

137
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:46,674
the name of the servant; and he promised that he 

138
00:14:46,674 --> 00:14:50,508
would go down into the wilderness unto our father. Yea, 

139
00:14:50,508 --> 00:14:54,341
and he also made an oath unto us that he 

140
00:14:54,341 --> 00:14:58,174
would tarry with us from that time forth. 

141
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:03,564
36 Now we were desirous that he should tarry with 

142
00:15:03,564 --> 00:15:09,064
us for this cause, that the Jews might not know 

143
00:15:09,064 --> 00:15:14,564
concerning our flight into the wilderness, lest they should pursue 

144
00:15:14,564 --> 00:15:20,064
us and destroy us. 

145
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:24,686
37 And it came to pass that when Zoram had 

146
00:15:24,686 --> 00:15:29,019
made an oath unto us, our fears did cease concerning 

147
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:33,353
him. 

148
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:38,916
38 And it came to pass that we took the 

149
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:44,666
plates of brass and the servant of Laban, and departed 

150
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:50,416
into the wilderness, and journeyed unto the tent of our 

151
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:56,166
father.
