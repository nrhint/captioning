00:00:00,4 --> 00:00:09,829
Chapter 12 Nephi sees in vision the land of

2
00:00:09,829 --> 00:00:19,258
 promise; the righteousness, iniquity, and downfall of

3
00:00:19,258 --> 00:00:28,687
 its inhabitants; the coming of the Lamb of God among

4
00:00:28,687 --> 00:00:38,116
 them; how the Twelve Disciples and the Twelve

5
00:00:38,116 --> 00:00:47,545
 Apostles will judge Israel; and the loathsome and

6
00:00:47,545 --> 00:00:56,974
 filthy state of those who dwindle in unbelief. About

7
00:00:56,974 --> 00:01:06,403
 600–592 B.C.

8
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:11,966
1 And it came to pass that the angel said unto me:

9
00:01:11,966 --> 00:01:17,299
 Look, and behold thy seed, and also the seed of

10
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:22,632
 thy brethren. And I looked and beheld the land of

11
00:01:22,632 --> 00:01:27,965
 promise; and I beheld multitudes of people, yea,

12
00:01:27,965 --> 00:01:33,298
 even as it were in number as many as the sand of the

13
00:01:33,298 --> 00:01:38,631
 sea

14
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:47,532
2 And it came to pass that I beheld multitudes

15
00:01:47,532 --> 00:01:56,532
 gathered together to battle, one against the other;

16
00:01:56,532 --> 00:02:05,532
 and I beheld wars, and rumors of wars, and great

17
00:02:05,532 --> 00:02:14,532
 slaughters with the sword among my people

18
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:20,218
3 And it came to pass that I beheld many

19
00:02:20,218 --> 00:02:25,968
 generations pass away, after the manner of wars and

20
00:02:25,968 --> 00:02:31,718
 contentions in the land; and I beheld many cities, yea,

21
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:37,468
 even that I did not number them

22
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:45,133
4 And it came to pass that I saw a mist of

23
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:53,042
 darkness on the face of the land of promise; and I saw

24
00:02:53,042 --> 00:03:00,951
 lightnings, and I heard thunderings, and

25
00:03:00,951 --> 00:03:08,86
 earthquakes, and all manner of tumultuous noises; and I saw

26
00:03:08,86 --> 00:03:16,769
 the earth and the rocks, that they rent; and I saw

27
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:24,678
 mountains tumbling into pieces; and I saw the

28
00:03:24,678 --> 00:03:32,587
 plains of the earth, that they were broken up; and I

29
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:40,496
 saw many cities that they were sunk; and I saw many

30
00:03:40,496 --> 00:03:48,405
 that they were burned with fire; and I saw many

31
00:03:48,405 --> 00:03:56,314
 that did tumble to the earth, because of the

32
00:03:56,314 --> 00:04:04,223
 quaking thereof

33
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:10,478
5 And it came to pass after I saw these things, I

34
00:04:10,478 --> 00:04:16,478
 saw the vapor of darkness, that it passed from off

35
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:22,478
 the face of the earth; and behold, I saw

36
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:28,478
 multitudes who had not fallen because of the great and

37
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:34,478
 terrible judgments of the Lord

38
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:40,141
6 And I saw the heavens open, and the Lamb of God

39
00:04:40,141 --> 00:04:45,808
 descending out of heaven; and he came down and

40
00:04:45,808 --> 00:04:51,475
 showed himself unto them

41
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:58,559
7 And I also saw and bear record that the Holy

42
00:04:58,559 --> 00:05:05,226
 Ghost fell upon twelve others; and they were ordained

43
00:05:05,226 --> 00:05:11,893
 of God, and chosen

44
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:17,912
8 And the angel spake unto me, saying: Behold the

45
00:05:17,912 --> 00:05:23,912
 twelve disciples of the Lamb, who are chosen to

46
00:05:23,912 --> 00:05:29,912
 minister unto thy seed

47
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:36,763
9 And he said unto me: Thou rememberest the twelve

48
00:05:36,763 --> 00:05:43,563
 apostles of the Lamb? Behold they are they who

49
00:05:43,563 --> 00:05:50,363
 shall judge the twelve tribes of Israel; wherefore,

50
00:05:50,363 --> 00:05:57,163
 the twelve ministers of thy seed shall be judged

51
00:05:57,163 --> 00:06:03,963
 of them; for ye are of the house of Israel

52
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:09,897
10 And these twelve ministers whom thou beholdest

53
00:06:09,897 --> 00:06:15,897
 shall judge thy seed. And, behold, they are

54
00:06:15,897 --> 00:06:21,897
 righteous forever; for because of their faith in the

55
00:06:21,897 --> 00:06:27,897
 Lamb of God their garments are made white in his

56
00:06:27,897 --> 00:06:33,897
 blood

57
00:06:33,26 --> 00:06:40,093
11 And the angel said unto me: Look! And I looked,

58
00:06:40,093 --> 00:06:46,926
 and beheld three generations pass away in

59
00:06:46,926 --> 00:06:53,759
 righteousness; and their garments were white even like

60
00:06:53,759 --> 00:07:00,592
 unto the Lamb of God. And the angel said unto me:

61
00:07:00,592 --> 00:07:07,425
 These are made white in the blood of the Lamb,

62
00:07:07,425 --> 00:07:14,258
 because of their faith in him

63
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:21,101
12 And I, Nephi, also saw many of the fourth

64
00:07:21,101 --> 00:07:27,601
 generation who passed away in righteousness

65
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:33,114
13 And it came to pass that I saw the multitudes

66
00:07:33,114 --> 00:07:38,614
 of the earth gathered together

67
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:46,625
14 And the angel said unto me: Behold thy seed,

68
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:54,625
 and also the seed of thy brethren

69
00:07:54,941 --> 00:08:00,191
15 And it came to pass that I looked and beheld

70
00:08:00,191 --> 00:08:05,441
 the people of my seed gathered together in

71
00:08:05,441 --> 00:08:10,691
 multitudes against the seed of my brethren; and they were

72
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:15,941
 gathered together to battle

73
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:22,712
16 And the angel spake unto me, saying: Behold the

74
00:08:22,712 --> 00:08:29,962
 fountain of filthy water which thy father saw;

75
00:08:29,962 --> 00:08:37,212
 yea, even the river of which he spake; and the

76
00:08:37,212 --> 00:08:44,462
 depths thereof are the depths of hell

77
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:49,357
17 And the mists of darkness are the temptations

78
00:08:49,357 --> 00:08:54,357
 of the devil, which blindeth the eyes, and

79
00:08:54,357 --> 00:08:59,357
 hardeneth the hearts of the children of men, and leadeth

80
00:08:59,357 --> 00:09:04,357
 them away into broad roads, that they perish and

81
00:09:04,357 --> 00:09:09,357
 are lost

82
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:16,974
18 And the large and spacious building, which thy

83
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:24,099
 father saw, is vain imaginations and the pride of

84
00:09:24,099 --> 00:09:31,224
 the children of men. And a great and a terrible

85
00:09:31,224 --> 00:09:38,349
 gulf divideth them; yea, even the word of the

86
00:09:38,349 --> 00:09:45,474
 justice of the Eternal God, and the Messiah who is the

87
00:09:45,474 --> 00:09:52,599
 Lamb of God, of whom the Holy Ghost beareth record,

88
00:09:52,599 --> 00:09:59,724
 from the beginning of the world until this time,

89
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:06,849
 and from this time henceforth and forever

90
00:10:06,506 --> 00:10:13,673
19 And while the angel spake these words, I beheld

91
00:10:13,673 --> 00:10:20,84
 and saw that the seed of my brethren did contend

92
00:10:20,84 --> 00:10:28,007
 against my seed, according to the word of the

93
00:10:28,007 --> 00:10:35,174
 angel; and because of the pride of my seed, and the

94
00:10:35,174 --> 00:10:42,341
 temptations of the devil, I beheld that the seed of

95
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:49,508
 my brethren did overpower the people of my seed

96
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:55,416
20 And it came to pass that I beheld, and saw the

97
00:10:55,416 --> 00:11:00,916
 people of the seed of my brethren that they had

98
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:06,416
 overcome my seed; and they went forth in multitudes

99
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:11,916
 upon the face of the land

100
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:18,738
21 And I saw them gathered together in multitudes;

101
00:11:18,738 --> 00:11:25,738
 and I saw wars and rumors of wars among them; and

102
00:11:25,738 --> 00:11:32,738
 in wars and rumors of wars I saw many generations

103
00:11:32,738 --> 00:11:39,738
 pass away

104
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:44,932
22 And the angel said unto me: Behold these shall

105
00:11:44,932 --> 00:11:50,432
 dwindle in unbelief

106
00:11:50,81 --> 00:11:54,81
23 And it came to pass that I beheld, after they

107
00:11:54,81 --> 00:11:58,81
 had dwindled in unbelief they became a dark, and

108
00:11:58,81 --> 00:12:02,81
 loathsome, and a filthy people, full of idleness and

109
00:12:02,81 --> 00:12:06,81
 all manner of abominations.
