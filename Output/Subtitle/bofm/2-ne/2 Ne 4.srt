00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 4 Lehi counsels and blesses his

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
posterity—He dies and is buried—Nephi

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
glories in the goodness of God—Nephi puts his

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:03:31,
trust in the Lord forever. About 588–570 B.C. 

5
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
1 And now, I, Nephi, speak

6
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
concerning the prophecies of which my

7
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
father hath spoken, concerning

8
00:03:31,0 --> 00:06:27,
Joseph, who was carried into Egypt.

9
00:06:27,0 --> 00:06:27,0
2 For behold, he truly

10
00:06:27,0 --> 00:06:27,0
prophesied concerning all his

11
00:06:27,0 --> 00:06:27,0
seed. And the prophecies which

12
00:06:27,0 --> 00:06:27,0
he wrote, there are not many

13
00:06:27,0 --> 00:06:27,0
greater. And he prophesied

14
00:06:27,0 --> 00:06:27,0
concerning us, and our

15
00:06:27,0 --> 00:06:27,0
future generations; and they are

16
00:06:27,0 --> 00:11:56,
written upon the plates of brass.

17
00:11:56,0 --> 00:11:56,0
3 Wherefore, after my

18
00:11:56,0 --> 00:11:56,0
father had made an end of

19
00:11:56,0 --> 00:11:56,0
speaking concerning the

20
00:11:56,0 --> 00:11:56,0
prophecies of Joseph, he

21
00:11:56,0 --> 00:11:56,0
called the children of

22
00:11:56,0 --> 00:11:56,0
Laman, his sons, and his

23
00:11:56,0 --> 00:11:56,0
daughters, and said unto them:

24
00:11:56,0 --> 00:11:56,0
Behold, my sons, and my

25
00:11:56,0 --> 00:11:56,0
daughters, who are the

26
00:11:56,0 --> 00:11:56,0
sons and the daughters of

27
00:11:56,0 --> 00:11:56,0
my firstborn, I would that

28
00:11:56,0 --> 00:16:52,
ye should give ear unto my words.

29
00:16:52,0 --> 00:16:52,0
4 For the Lord God hath

30
00:16:52,0 --> 00:16:52,0
said that: Inasmuch as

31
00:16:52,0 --> 00:16:52,0
ye shall keep my

32
00:16:52,0 --> 00:16:52,0
commandments ye shall prosper in

33
00:16:52,0 --> 00:16:52,0
the land; and inasmuch

34
00:16:52,0 --> 00:16:52,0
as ye will not keep my

35
00:16:52,0 --> 00:16:52,0
commandments ye shall be

36
00:16:52,0 --> 00:20:23,
cut off from my presence.

37
00:20:23,0 --> 00:20:23,0
5 But behold, my sons

38
00:20:23,0 --> 00:20:23,0
and my daughters, I

39
00:20:23,0 --> 00:20:23,0
cannot go down to my

40
00:20:23,0 --> 00:20:23,0
grave save I should leave

41
00:20:23,0 --> 00:20:23,0
a blessing upon you;

42
00:20:23,0 --> 00:20:23,0
for behold, I know

43
00:20:23,0 --> 00:20:23,0
that if ye are brought up

44
00:20:23,0 --> 00:20:23,0
in the way ye should

45
00:20:23,0 --> 00:20:53,
go ye will not depart from it.

46
00:20:53,0 --> 00:20:53,0
6 Wherefore, if ye

47
00:20:53,0 --> 00:20:53,0
are cursed, behold,

48
00:20:53,0 --> 00:20:53,0
I leave my

49
00:20:53,0 --> 00:20:53,0
blessing upon you, that

50
00:20:53,0 --> 00:20:53,0
the cursing may be

51
00:20:53,0 --> 00:20:53,0
taken from you and be

52
00:20:53,0 --> 00:20:53,0
answered upon the

53
00:20:53,0 --> 00:20:25,
heads of your parents.

54
00:20:25,0 --> 00:20:25,0
7 Wherefore,

55
00:20:25,0 --> 00:20:25,0
because of my

56
00:20:25,0 --> 00:20:25,0
blessing the Lord God

57
00:20:25,0 --> 00:20:25,0
will not suffer

58
00:20:25,0 --> 00:20:25,0
that ye shall

59
00:20:25,0 --> 00:20:25,0
perish; wherefore, he

60
00:20:25,0 --> 00:20:25,0
will be merciful

61
00:20:25,0 --> 00:20:25,0
unto you and unto

62
00:20:25,0 --> 00:21:23,
your seed forever.

63
00:21:23,0 --> 00:21:23,0
8 And it came

64
00:21:23,0 --> 00:21:23,0
to pass that

65
00:21:23,0 --> 00:21:23,0
after my father

66
00:21:23,0 --> 00:21:23,0
had made an end

67
00:21:23,0 --> 00:21:23,0
of speaking to

68
00:21:23,0 --> 00:21:23,0
the sons and

69
00:21:23,0 --> 00:21:23,0
daughters of

70
00:21:23,0 --> 00:21:23,0
Laman, he caused the

71
00:21:23,0 --> 00:21:23,0
sons and

72
00:21:23,0 --> 00:21:23,0
daughters of Lemuel

73
00:21:23,0 --> 00:20:55,
to be brought before him.

74
00:20:55,0 --> 00:20:55,0
9 And he spake

75
00:20:55,0 --> 00:20:55,0
unto them,

76
00:20:55,0 --> 00:20:55,0
saying: Behold,

77
00:20:55,0 --> 00:20:55,0
my sons and my

78
00:20:55,0 --> 00:20:55,0
daughters,

79
00:20:55,0 --> 00:20:55,0
who are the sons

80
00:20:55,0 --> 00:20:55,0
and the

81
00:20:55,0 --> 00:20:55,0
daughters of my

82
00:20:55,0 --> 00:20:55,0
second son;

83
00:20:55,0 --> 00:20:55,0
behold I leave unto

84
00:20:55,0 --> 00:20:55,0
you the same

85
00:20:55,0 --> 00:20:55,0
blessing which

86
00:20:55,0 --> 00:20:55,0
I left unto

87
00:20:55,0 --> 00:20:55,0
the sons and

88
00:20:55,0 --> 00:20:55,0
daughters of

89
00:20:55,0 --> 00:20:55,0
Laman; wherefore,

90
00:20:55,0 --> 00:20:55,0
thou shalt

91
00:20:55,0 --> 00:20:55,0
not utterly be

92
00:20:55,0 --> 00:20:55,0
destroyed; but

93
00:20:55,0 --> 00:20:55,0
in the end thy

94
00:20:55,0 --> 00:20:27,
seed shall be blessed.

95
00:20:27,0 --> 00:20:27,0
10 And it

96
00:20:27,0 --> 00:20:27,0
came to pass

97
00:20:27,0 --> 00:20:27,0
that when my

98
00:20:27,0 --> 00:20:27,0
father had made

99
00:20:27,0 --> 00:20:27,0
an end of

100
00:20:27,0 --> 00:20:27,0
speaking unto

101
00:20:27,0 --> 00:20:27,0
them, behold,

102
00:20:27,0 --> 00:20:27,0
he spake unto

103
00:20:27,0 --> 00:20:27,0
the sons of

104
00:20:27,0 --> 00:20:27,0
Ishmael, yea,

105
00:20:27,0 --> 00:20:27,0
and even all

106
00:20:27,0 --> 00:20:57,
his household.

107
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
11 And after

108
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
he had made

109
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
an end of

110
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
speaking unto

111
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
them, he

112
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
spake unto

113
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
Sam, saying:

114
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
Blessed art

115
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
thou, and thy

116
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
seed; for

117
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
thou shalt

118
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
inherit the

119
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
land like unto

120
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
thy brother

121
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
Nephi. And

122
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
thy seed

123
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
shall be

124
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
numbered with his

125
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
seed; and

126
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
thou shalt be

127
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
even like

128
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
unto thy

129
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
brother, and thy

130
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
seed like

131
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
unto his seed;

132
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
and thou

133
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:29,
shalt be blessed in all thy days.

134
00:20:29,0 --> 00:20:29,0
12 And it

135
00:20:29,0 --> 00:20:29,0
came to pass

136
00:20:29,0 --> 00:20:29,0
after my

137
00:20:29,0 --> 00:20:29,0
father, Lehi,

138
00:20:29,0 --> 00:20:29,0
had spoken

139
00:20:29,0 --> 00:20:29,0
unto all his

140
00:20:29,0 --> 00:20:29,0
household,

141
00:20:29,0 --> 00:20:29,0
according to

142
00:20:29,0 --> 00:20:29,0
the feelings

143
00:20:29,0 --> 00:20:29,0
of his heart

144
00:20:29,0 --> 00:20:29,0
and the

145
00:20:29,0 --> 00:20:29,0
Spirit of the

146
00:20:29,0 --> 00:20:29,0
Lord which was

147
00:20:29,0 --> 00:20:29,0
in him, he

148
00:20:29,0 --> 00:20:29,0
waxed old.

149
00:20:29,0 --> 00:20:29,0
And it came

150
00:20:29,0 --> 00:20:29,0
to pass that

151
00:20:29,0 --> 00:20:29,0
he died, and

152
00:20:29,0 --> 00:20:01,
was buried.

153
00:20:01,0 --> 00:20:01,0
13 And it

154
00:20:01,0 --> 00:20:01,0
came to pass

155
00:20:01,0 --> 00:20:01,0
that not

156
00:20:01,0 --> 00:20:01,0
many days

157
00:20:01,0 --> 00:20:01,0
after his

158
00:20:01,0 --> 00:20:01,0
death, Laman

159
00:20:01,0 --> 00:20:01,0
and Lemuel

160
00:20:01,0 --> 00:20:01,0
and the sons

161
00:20:01,0 --> 00:20:01,0
of Ishmael

162
00:20:01,0 --> 00:20:01,0
were angry

163
00:20:01,0 --> 00:20:01,0
with me

164
00:20:01,0 --> 00:20:01,0
because of

165
00:20:01,0 --> 00:20:01,0
the

166
00:20:01,0 --> 00:20:45,
admonitions of the Lord.

167
00:20:45,0 --> 00:20:45,0
14 For I,

168
00:20:45,0 --> 00:20:45,0
Nephi, was

169
00:20:45,0 --> 00:20:45,0


170
00:20:45,0 --> 00:20:45,0
constrained to

171
00:20:45,0 --> 00:20:45,0
speak unto

172
00:20:45,0 --> 00:20:45,0
them,

173
00:20:45,0 --> 00:20:45,0
according to his

174
00:20:45,0 --> 00:20:45,0
word; for

175
00:20:45,0 --> 00:20:45,0
I had

176
00:20:45,0 --> 00:20:45,0
spoken many

177
00:20:45,0 --> 00:20:45,0
things unto

178
00:20:45,0 --> 00:20:45,0
them, and

179
00:20:45,0 --> 00:20:45,0
also my

180
00:20:45,0 --> 00:20:45,0
father,

181
00:20:45,0 --> 00:20:45,0
before his

182
00:20:45,0 --> 00:20:45,0
death; many

183
00:20:45,0 --> 00:20:45,0
of which

184
00:20:45,0 --> 00:20:45,0
sayings are

185
00:20:45,0 --> 00:20:45,0
written

186
00:20:45,0 --> 00:20:45,0
upon mine

187
00:20:45,0 --> 00:20:45,0
other

188

192
00:20:17,0 --> 00:20:17,0
15 And

193
00:20:17,0 --> 00:20:17,0
upon these

194
00:20:17,0 --> 00:20:17,0
I write

195
00:20:17,0 --> 00:20:17,0
the things

196
00:20:17,0 --> 00:20:17,0
of my

197
00:20:17,0 --> 00:20:17,0
soul, and

00:20:17,0 --> 00:20:17,0
plates of

205
00:20:17,0 --> 00:20:17,0
brass. For

206
00:20:17,0 --> 00:20:17,0
my soul

207
00:20:17,0 --> 00:20:17,0
delighteth

208

00:20:17,0 --> 00:20:17,0
and my

211
00:20:17,0 --> 00:20:17,0

212
00:20:17,0 --> 00:20:17,0
pondereth

213
00:20:17,0 --> 00:20:17,0
them, and

214
00:20:17,0 --> 00:20:17,0

and the profit of my children.

218
00:21:01,0 --> 00:21:01,0
16

219
00:21:01,0 --> 00:21:01,0
Behold, my

220
00:21:01,0 --> 00:21:01,0
soul

221
00:21:01,0 --> 00:21:01,0

00:21:01,0 --> 00:21:01,0
the Lord;

225
00:21:01,0 --> 00:21:01,0
and my

226
00:21:01,0 --> 00:21:01,0

499
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
26 O then, if I have seen so great things, if the Lord in his condescension unto the children of men hath visited men in so much mercy, why should my heart weep and my soul linger in the valley of sorrow, and my flesh waste away, and my strength slacken, because of mine

500
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0


501

27 And why should I yield to sin, because of my flesh? Yea, why should I give way to temptations, that the evil one have place in my heart to destroy my peace and afflict my soul? Why am I angry because of mine
