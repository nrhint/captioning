00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:23,75
Chapter 4 Lehi counsels and blesses his

2
00:00:23,75 --> 00:00:47,5
 posterity—He dies and is buried—Nephi glories in the

3
00:00:47,5 --> 00:01:11,25
 goodness of God—Nephi puts his trust in the Lord forever.

4
00:01:11,25 --> 00:01:35,0
 About 588–570 B.C.

5
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:41,029
1 And now, I, Nephi, speak concerning the

6
00:01:41,029 --> 00:01:46,362
 prophecies of which my father hath spoken, concerning

7
00:01:46,362 --> 00:01:51,695
 Joseph, who was carried into Egypt

8
00:01:51,645 --> 00:02:12,445
2 For behold, he truly prophesied concerning all

9
00:02:12,445 --> 00:02:33,245
 his seed. And the prophecies which he wrote, there

10
00:02:33,245 --> 00:02:54,045
 are not many greater. And he prophesied concerning

11
00:02:54,045 --> 00:03:14,845
 us, and our future generations; and they are

12
00:03:14,845 --> 00:03:35,645
 written upon the plates of brass

13
00:03:35,315 --> 00:04:18,601
3 Wherefore, after my father had made an end of

14
00:04:18,601 --> 00:05:01,887
 speaking concerning the prophecies of Joseph, he

15
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:45,173
 called the children of Laman, his sons, and his

16
00:05:45,173 --> 00:06:28,459
 daughters, and said unto them: Behold, my sons, and my

17
00:06:28,459 --> 00:07:11,745
 daughters, who are the sons and the daughters of

18
00:07:11,745 --> 00:07:55,031
 my firstborn, I would that ye should give ear unto

19
00:07:55,031 --> 00:08:38,317
 my words

20
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:48,351
4 For the Lord God hath said that: Inasmuch as ye

21
00:08:48,351 --> 00:08:58,351
 shall keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the

22
00:08:58,351 --> 00:09:08,351
 land; and inasmuch as ye will not keep my

23
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:18,351
 commandments ye shall be cut off from my presence

24
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:31,024
5 But behold, my sons and my daughters, I cannot

25
00:09:31,024 --> 00:09:43,824
 go down to my grave save I should leave a blessing

26
00:09:43,824 --> 00:09:56,624
 upon you; for behold, I know that if ye are

27
00:09:56,624 --> 00:10:09,424
 brought up in the way ye should go ye will not depart

28
00:10:09,424 --> 00:10:22,224
 from it

29
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:39,771
6 Wherefore, if ye are cursed, behold, I leave my

30
00:10:39,771 --> 00:10:57,521
 blessing upon you, that the cursing may be taken

31
00:10:57,521 --> 00:11:15,271
 from you and be answered upon the heads of your

32
00:11:15,271 --> 00:11:33,021
 parents

33
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:59,793
7 Wherefore, because of my blessing the Lord God

34
00:11:59,793 --> 00:12:25,793
 will not suffer that ye shall perish; wherefore, he

35
00:12:25,793 --> 00:12:51,793
 will be merciful unto you and unto your seed

36
00:12:51,793 --> 00:13:17,793
 forever

37
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:33,463
8 And it came to pass that after my father had

38
00:13:33,463 --> 00:13:49,463
 made an end of speaking to the sons and daughters of

39
00:13:49,463 --> 00:14:05,463
 Laman, he caused the sons and daughters of Lemuel

40
00:14:05,463 --> 00:14:21,463
 to be brought before him

41
00:14:21,26 --> 00:14:24,689
9 And he spake unto them, saying: Behold, my sons

42
00:14:24,689 --> 00:14:28,118
 and my daughters, who are the sons and the

43
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:31,547
 daughters of my second son; behold I leave unto you the

44
00:14:31,547 --> 00:14:34,976
 same blessing which I left unto the sons and

45
00:14:34,976 --> 00:14:38,405
 daughters of Laman; wherefore, thou shalt not utterly be

46
00:14:38,405 --> 00:14:41,834
 destroyed; but in the end thy seed shall be

47
00:14:41,834 --> 00:14:45,263
 blessed

48
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:57,184
10 And it came to pass that when my father had

49
00:14:57,184 --> 00:15:09,184
 made an end of speaking unto them, behold, he spake

50
00:15:09,184 --> 00:15:21,184
 unto the sons of Ishmael, yea, and even all his

51
00:15:21,184 --> 00:15:33,184
 household

52
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:37,461
11 And after he had made an end of speaking unto

53
00:15:37,461 --> 00:15:41,89
 them, he spake unto Sam, saying: Blessed art thou,

54
00:15:41,89 --> 00:15:46,319
 and thy seed; for thou shalt inherit the land like

55
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:50,748
 unto thy brother Nephi. And thy seed shall be

56
00:15:50,748 --> 00:15:55,177
 numbered with his seed; and thou shalt be even like

57
00:15:55,177 --> 00:15:59,606
 unto thy brother, and thy seed like unto his seed;

58
00:15:59,606 --> 00:16:04,035
 and thou shalt be blessed in all thy days

59
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:09,731
12 And it came to pass after my father, Lehi, had

60
00:16:09,731 --> 00:16:14,531
 spoken unto all his household, according to the

61
00:16:14,531 --> 00:16:19,331
 feelings of his heart and the Spirit of the Lord

62
00:16:19,331 --> 00:16:24,131
 which was in him, he waxed old. And it came to pass

63
00:16:24,131 --> 00:16:28,931
 that he died, and was buried

64
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:32,855
13 And it came to pass that not many days after

65
00:16:32,855 --> 00:16:36,855
 his death, Laman and Lemuel and the sons of Ishmael

66
00:16:36,855 --> 00:16:40,855
 were angry with me because of the admonitions of

67
00:16:40,855 --> 00:16:44,855
 the Lord

68
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:41,029
16 Behold, my soul delighteth in the things of the

69
00:01:41,029 --> 00:01:46,362
 Lord; and my heart pondereth continually upon the

70
00:01:46,362 --> 00:01:51,695
 things which I have seen and heard

71
00:01:51,645 --> 00:02:12,445
17 Nevertheless, notwithstanding the great

72
00:02:12,445 --> 00:02:33,245
 goodness of the Lord, in showing me his great and

73
00:02:33,245 --> 00:02:54,045
 marvelous works, my heart exclaimeth: O wretched man that

74
00:02:54,045 --> 00:03:14,845
 I am! Yea, my heart sorroweth because of my

75
00:03:14,845 --> 00:03:35,645
 flesh; my soul grieveth because of mine iniquities

76
00:03:35,315 --> 00:06:06,815
18 I am encompassed about, because of the

77
00:06:06,815 --> 00:08:38,315
 temptations and the sins which do so easily beset me

78
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:51,684
19 And when I desire to rejoice, my heart groaneth

79
00:08:51,684 --> 00:09:05,017
 because of my sins; nevertheless, I know in whom

80
00:09:05,017 --> 00:09:18,35
 I have trusted

81
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:34,224
20 My God hath been my support; he hath led me

82
00:09:34,224 --> 00:09:50,224
 through mine afflictions in the wilderness; and he

83
00:09:50,224 --> 00:10:06,224
 hath preserved me upon the waters of the great deep

84
00:10:06,224 --> 00:10:22,224


85
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:57,521
21 He hath filled me with his love, even unto the

86
00:10:57,521 --> 00:11:33,021
 consuming of my flesh

87
00:11:33,793 --> 00:12:25,793
22 He hath confounded mine enemies, unto the

88
00:12:25,793 --> 00:13:17,793
 causing of them to quake before me

89
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:38,796
23 Behold, he hath heard my cry by day, and he

90
00:13:38,796 --> 00:14:00,129
 hath given me knowledge by visions in the night-time

91
00:14:00,129 --> 00:14:21,462


92
00:14:21,26 --> 00:14:29,26
24 And by day have I waxed bold in mighty prayer

93
00:14:29,26 --> 00:14:37,26
 before him; yea, my voice have I sent up on high;

94
00:14:37,26 --> 00:14:45,26
 and angels came down and ministered unto me

95
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:54,784
25 And upon the wings of his Spirit hath my body

96
00:14:54,784 --> 00:15:04,384
 been carried away upon exceedingly high mountains.

97
00:15:04,384 --> 00:15:13,984
 And mine eyes have beheld great things, yea, even

98
00:15:13,984 --> 00:15:23,584
 too great for man; therefore I was bidden that I

99
00:15:23,584 --> 00:15:33,184
 should not write them

100
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:38,199
26 O then, if I have seen so great things, if the

101
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:43,366
 Lord in his condescension unto the children of men

102
00:15:43,366 --> 00:15:48,533
 hath visited men in so much mercy, why should my

103
00:15:48,533 --> 00:15:53,7
 heart weep and my soul linger in the valley of

104
00:15:53,7 --> 00:15:58,867
 sorrow, and my flesh waste away, and my strength

105
00:15:58,867 --> 00:16:04,034
 slacken, because of mine afflictions

106
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:09,731
27 And why should I yield to sin, because of my

107
00:16:09,731 --> 00:16:14,531
 flesh? Yea, why should I give way to temptations,

108
00:16:14,531 --> 00:16:19,331
 that the evil one have place in my heart to destroy

109
00:16:19,331 --> 00:16:24,131
 my peace and afflict my soul? Why am I angry

110
00:16:24,131 --> 00:16:28,931
 because of mine enemy

111
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:34,188
28 Awake, my soul! No longer droop in sin.

112
00:16:34,188 --> 00:16:39,521
 Rejoice, O my heart, and give place no more for the enemy

113
00:16:39,521 --> 00:16:44,854
 of my soul

114
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:39,696
31 O Lord, wilt thou redeem my soul? Wilt thou

115
00:01:39,696 --> 00:01:43,696
 deliver me out of the hands of mine enemies? Wilt

116
00:01:43,696 --> 00:01:47,696
 thou make me that I may shake at the appearance of

117
00:01:47,696 --> 00:01:51,696
 sin

118
00:01:51,645 --> 00:02:08,978
32 May the gates of hell be shut continually

119
00:02:08,978 --> 00:02:26,311
 before me, because that my heart is broken and my

120
00:02:26,311 --> 00:02:43,644
 spirit is contrite! O Lord, wilt thou not shut the

121
00:02:43,644 --> 00:03:00,977
 gates of thy righteousness before me, that I may walk

122
00:03:00,977 --> 00:03:18,31
 in the path of the low valley, that I may be

123
00:03:18,31 --> 00:03:35,643
 strict in the plain road

124
00:03:35,315 --> 00:04:18,601
33 O Lord, wilt thou encircle me around in the

125
00:04:18,601 --> 00:05:01,887
 robe of thy righteousness! O Lord, wilt thou make a

126
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:45,173
 way for mine escape before mine enemies! Wilt thou

127
00:05:45,173 --> 00:06:28,459
 make my path straight before me! Wilt thou not

128
00:06:28,459 --> 00:07:11,745
 place a stumbling block in my way—but that thou

129
00:07:11,745 --> 00:07:55,031
 wouldst clear my way before me, and hedge not up my

130
00:07:55,031 --> 00:08:38,317
 way, but the ways of mine enemy

131
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:45,018
34 O Lord, I have trusted in thee, and I will

132
00:08:45,018 --> 00:08:51,685
 trust in thee forever. I will not put my trust in the

133
00:08:51,685 --> 00:08:58,352
 arm of flesh; for I know that cursed is he that

134
00:08:58,352 --> 00:09:05,019
 putteth his trust in the arm of flesh. Yea, cursed

135
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:11,686
 is he that putteth his trust in man or maketh flesh

136
00:09:11,686 --> 00:09:18,353
 his arm

137
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:18,224
35 Yea, I know that God will give liberally to him

138
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:18,224
 that asketh. Yea, my God will give me, if I ask

139
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:18,224
 not amiss; therefore I will lift up my voice unto

140
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:18,224
 thee; yea, I will cry unto thee, my God, the rock

141
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:18,224
 of my righteousness. Behold, my voice shall forever

142
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:18,224
 ascend up unto thee, my rock and mine everlasting

143
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:18,224
 God. Amen.
