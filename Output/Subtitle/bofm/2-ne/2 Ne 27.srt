1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,167
Chapter 27 Darkness and apostasy will cover the

2
00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:02,334
 earth in the last days—The Book of Mormon will come

3
00:00:02,334 --> 00:00:03,501
 forth—Three witnesses will testify of the book—The

4
00:00:03,501 --> 00:00:04,668
 learned man will say he cannot read the sealed

5
00:00:04,668 --> 00:00:05,835
 book—The Lord will do a marvelous work and a

6
00:00:05,835 --> 00:00:07,002
 wonder—Compare 
Isaiah 29. About 559–545 B.C.

7
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,118
1 But, behold, in the last days, or in the days of

8
00:00:09,118 --> 00:00:10,261
 the Gentiles—yea, behold all the nations of the

9
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:11,404
 Gentiles and also the Jews, both those who shall

10
00:00:11,404 --> 00:00:12,547
 come upon this land and those who shall be upon

11
00:00:12,547 --> 00:00:13,69
 other lands, yea, even upon all the lands of the

12
00:00:13,69 --> 00:00:14,833
 earth, behold, they will be drunken with iniquity and

13
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:15,976
 all manner of abominations

14
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,549
2 And when that day shall come they shall be

15
00:00:17,549 --> 00:00:19,149
 visited of the Lord of Hosts, with thunder and with

16
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:20,749
 earthquake, and with a great noise, and with storm,

17
00:00:20,749 --> 00:00:22,349
 and with tempest, and with the flame of devouring

18
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:23,949
 fire

19
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:24,724
3 And all the nations that fight against Zion, and

20
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:25,524
 that distress her, shall be as a dream of a night

21
00:00:25,524 --> 00:00:26,324
 vision; yea, it shall be unto them, even as unto

22
00:00:26,324 --> 00:00:27,124
 a hungry man which dreameth, and behold he eateth

23
00:00:27,124 --> 00:00:27,924
 but he awaketh and his soul is empty; or like unto

24
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:28,724
 a thirsty man which dreameth, and behold he

25
00:00:28,724 --> 00:00:29,524
 drinketh but he awaketh and behold he is faint, and his

26
00:00:29,524 --> 00:00:30,324
 soul hath appetite; yea, even so shall the

27
00:00:30,324 --> 00:00:31,124
 multitude of all the nations be that fight against Mount

28
00:00:31,124 --> 00:00:31,924
 Zion

29
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,899
4 For behold, all ye that doeth iniquity, stay

30
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,899
 yourselves and wonder, for ye shall cry out, and cry;

31
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:37,899
 yea, ye shall be drunken but not with wine, ye

32
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:39,899
 shall stagger but not with strong drink

33
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,473
5 For behold, the Lord hath poured out upon you

34
00:00:41,473 --> 00:00:43,073
 the spirit of deep sleep. For behold, ye have closed

35
00:00:43,073 --> 00:00:44,673
 your eyes, and ye have rejected the prophets; and

36
00:00:44,673 --> 00:00:46,273
 your rulers, and the seers hath he covered

37
00:00:46,273 --> 00:00:47,873
 because of your iniquity

38
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,848
6 And it shall come to pass that the Lord God

39
00:00:49,848 --> 00:00:51,848
 shall bring forth unto you the words of a book, and

40
00:00:51,848 --> 00:00:53,848
 they shall be the words of them which have

41
00:00:53,848 --> 00:00:55,848
 slumbered

42
00:00:55,822 --> 00:03:03,489
7 And behold the book shall be sealed; and in the

43
00:03:03,489 --> 00:05:11,156
 book shall be a revelation from God, from the

44
00:05:11,156 --> 00:07:18,823
 beginning of the world to the ending thereof

45
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:28,205
8 Wherefore, because of the things which are

46
00:07:28,205 --> 00:07:37,805
 sealed up, the things which are sealed shall not be

47
00:07:37,805 --> 00:07:47,405
 delivered in the day of the wickedness and

48
00:07:47,405 --> 00:07:57,005
 abominations of the people. Wherefore the book shall be kept

49
00:07:57,005 --> 00:08:06,605
 from them

50
00:08:06,453 --> 00:09:30,203
9 But the book shall be delivered unto a man, and

51
00:09:30,203 --> 00:10:53,953
 he shall deliver the words of the book, which are

52
00:10:53,953 --> 00:12:17,703
 the words of those who have slumbered in the dust,

53
00:12:17,703 --> 00:13:41,453
 and he shall deliver these words unto another

54
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:08,975
12 Wherefore, at that day when the book shall be

55
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:09,975
 delivered unto the man of whom I have spoken, the

56
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:10,975
 book shall be hid from the eyes of the world, that

57
00:00:10,975 --> 00:00:11,975
 the eyes of none shall behold it save it be that

58
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:12,975
 three witnesses shall behold it, by the power of

59
00:00:12,975 --> 00:00:13,975
 God, besides him to whom the book shall be

60
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:14,975
 delivered; and they shall testify to the truth of the book

61
00:00:14,975 --> 00:00:15,975
 and the things therein

62
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,282
13 And there is none other which shall view it,

63
00:00:17,282 --> 00:00:18,615
 save it be a few according to the will of God, to

64
00:00:18,615 --> 00:00:19,948
 bear testimony of his word unto the children of men;

65
00:00:19,948 --> 00:00:21,281
 for the Lord God hath said that the words of the

66
00:00:21,281 --> 00:00:22,614
 faithful should speak as if it were from the dead

67
00:00:22,614 --> 00:00:23,947


68
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,524
14 Wherefore, the Lord God will proceed to bring

69
00:00:25,524 --> 00:00:27,124
 forth the words of the book; and in the mouth of as

70
00:00:27,124 --> 00:00:28,724
 many witnesses as seemeth him good will he

71
00:00:28,724 --> 00:00:30,324
 establish his word; and wo be unto him that rejecteth

72
00:00:30,324 --> 00:00:31,924
 the word of God

73
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,042
15 But behold, it shall come to pass that the Lord

74
00:00:33,042 --> 00:00:34,185
 God shall say unto him to whom he shall deliver

75
00:00:34,185 --> 00:00:35,328
 the book: Take these words which are not sealed and

76
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,471
 deliver them to another, that he may show them

77
00:00:36,471 --> 00:00:37,614
 unto the learned, saying: Read this, I pray thee.

78
00:00:37,614 --> 00:00:38,757
 And the learned shall say: Bring hither the book,

79
00:00:38,757 --> 00:00:39,9
 and I will read them

80
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,54
16 And now, because of the glory of the world and

81
00:00:42,54 --> 00:00:45,207
 to get gain will they say this, and not for the

82
00:00:45,207 --> 00:00:47,874
 glory of God

83
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:51,848
17 And the man shall say: I cannot bring the book,

84
00:00:51,848 --> 00:00:55,848
 for it is sealed

85
00:00:55,822 --> 00:07:18,822
18 Then shall the learned say: I cannot read it

86
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:30,605
19 Wherefore it shall come to pass, that the Lord

87
00:07:30,605 --> 00:07:42,605
 God will deliver again the book and the words

88
00:07:42,605 --> 00:07:54,605
 thereof to him that is not learned; and the man that

89
00:07:54,605 --> 00:08:06,605
 is not learned shall say: I am not learned

90
00:08:06,453 --> 00:09:13,453
20 Then shall the Lord God say unto him: The

91
00:09:13,453 --> 00:10:20,453
 learned shall not read them, for they have rejected

92
00:10:20,453 --> 00:11:27,453
 them, and I am able to do mine own work; wherefore

93
00:11:27,453 --> 00:12:34,453
 thou shalt read the words which I shall give unto

94
00:12:34,453 --> 00:13:41,453
 thee

95
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,575
23 For behold, I am God; and I am a God of

96
00:00:09,575 --> 00:00:11,175
 miracles; and I will show unto the world that I am the

97
00:00:11,175 --> 00:00:12,775
 same yesterday, today, and forever; and I work not

98
00:00:12,775 --> 00:00:14,375
 among the children of men save it be according to

99
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:15,975
 their faith

100
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,616
24 And again it shall come to pass that the Lord

101
00:00:18,616 --> 00:00:21,283
 shall say unto him that shall read the words that

102
00:00:21,283 --> 00:00:23,95
 shall be delivered him

103
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,924
25 Forasmuch as this people draw near unto me with

104
00:00:25,924 --> 00:00:27,924
 their mouth, and with their lips do honor me, but

105
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:29,924
 have removed their hearts far from me, and their

106
00:00:29,924 --> 00:00:31,924
 fear towards me is taught by the precepts of men

107
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,499
26 Therefore, I will proceed to do a marvelous

108
00:00:33,499 --> 00:00:35,099
 work among this people, yea, a marvelous work and a

109
00:00:35,099 --> 00:00:36,699
 wonder, for the wisdom of their wise and learned

110
00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:38,299
 shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent

111
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:39,899
 shall be hid

112
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:40,673
27 And wo unto them that seek deep to hide their

113
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:41,473
 counsel from the Lord! And their works are in the

114
00:00:41,473 --> 00:00:42,273
 dark; and they say: Who seeth us, and who knoweth

115
00:00:42,273 --> 00:00:43,073
 us? And they also say: Surely, your turning of

116
00:00:43,073 --> 00:00:43,873
 things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter’s

117
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:44,673
 clay. But behold, I will show unto them, saith the

118
00:00:44,673 --> 00:00:45,473
 Lord of Hosts, that I know all their works. For

119
00:00:45,473 --> 00:00:46,273
 shall the work say of him that made it, he made me

120
00:00:46,273 --> 00:00:47,073
 not? Or shall the thing framed say of him that

121
00:00:47,073 --> 00:00:47,873
 framed it, he had no understanding

122
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,448
28 But behold, saith the Lord of Hosts: I will

123
00:00:49,448 --> 00:00:51,048
 show unto the children of men that it is yet a very

124
00:00:51,048 --> 00:00:52,648
 little while and Lebanon shall be turned into a

125
00:00:52,648 --> 00:00:54,248
 fruitful field; and the fruitful field shall be

126
00:00:54,248 --> 00:00:55,848
 esteemed as a forest

127
00:00:55,822 --> 00:03:03,489
29 And in that day shall the deaf hear the words

128
00:03:03,489 --> 00:05:11,156
 of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see

129
00:05:11,156 --> 00:07:18,823
 out of obscurity and out of darkness

130
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:34,605
30 And the meek also shall increase, and their joy

131
00:07:34,605 --> 00:07:50,605
 shall be in the Lord, and the poor among men

132
00:07:50,605 --> 00:08:06,605
 shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel

133
00:08:06,453 --> 00:09:30,203
31 For assuredly as the Lord liveth they shall see

134
00:09:30,203 --> 00:10:53,953
 that the terrible one is brought to naught, and

135
00:10:53,953 --> 00:12:17,703
 the scorner is consumed, and all that watch for

136
00:12:17,703 --> 00:13:41,453
 iniquity are cut off

137
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,975
34 But when he seeth his children, the work of my

138
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:11,975
 hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my

139
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:13,975
 name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and

140
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:15,975
 shall fear the God of Israel

141
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,616
35 They also that erred in spirit shall come to

142
00:00:18,616 --> 00:00:21,283
 understanding, and they that murmured shall learn

143
00:00:21,283 --> 00:00:23,95
 doctrine.
