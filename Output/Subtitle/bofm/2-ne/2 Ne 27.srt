1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,167
Chapter 27 Darkness and apostasy will cover the

2
00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:02,334
earth in the last days—The Book of Mormon will

3
00:00:02,334 --> 00:00:03,501
come forth—Three witnesses will testify of the

4
00:00:03,501 --> 00:00:04,668
book—The learned man will say he cannot read the

5
00:00:04,668 --> 00:00:05,835
sealed book—The Lord will do a marvelous work and

6
00:00:05,835 --> 00:00:07,975
a wonder—Compare 
Isaiah 29. About 559–545 B.C. 

7
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:08,404
1 But, behold, in the last days, or in the

8
00:00:08,404 --> 00:00:08,833
days of the Gentiles—yea, behold all the nations

9
00:00:08,833 --> 00:00:09,262
of the Gentiles and also the Jews, both those

10
00:00:09,262 --> 00:00:09,691
who shall come upon this land and those who

11
00:00:09,691 --> 00:00:10,12
shall be upon other lands, yea, even upon all

12
00:00:10,12 --> 00:00:10,549
the lands of the earth, behold, they will be

13
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:10,978
drunken with iniquity and all manner of abominations—

14
00:00:10,978 --> 00:00:12,978
2 And when that day shall come they

15
00:00:12,978 --> 00:00:14,978
shall be visited of the Lord of Hosts, with

16
00:00:14,978 --> 00:00:16,978
thunder and with earthquake, and with a

17
00:00:16,978 --> 00:00:18,978
great noise, and with storm, and with

18
00:00:18,978 --> 00:00:20,854
tempest, and with the flame of devouring fire.

19
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,021
3 And all the nations that fight

20
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:23,188
against Zion, and that distress her, shall

21
00:00:23,188 --> 00:00:24,355
be as a dream of a night vision; yea,

22
00:00:24,355 --> 00:00:25,522
it shall be unto them, even as unto a

23
00:00:25,522 --> 00:00:26,689
hungry man which dreameth, and behold

24
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:27,856
he eateth but he awaketh and his soul

25
00:00:27,856 --> 00:00:29,023
is empty; or like unto a thirsty man

26
00:00:29,023 --> 00:00:30,19
which dreameth, and behold he drinketh

27
00:00:30,19 --> 00:00:31,357
but he awaketh and behold he is faint,

28
00:00:31,357 --> 00:00:32,524
and his soul hath appetite; yea, even

29
00:00:32,524 --> 00:00:33,691
so shall the multitude of all the

30
00:00:33,691 --> 00:00:34,668
nations be that fight against Mount Zion.

31
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:35,468
4 For behold, all ye that doeth

32
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:36,268
iniquity, stay yourselves and wonder, for

33
00:00:36,268 --> 00:00:37,068
ye shall cry out, and cry; yea, ye

34
00:00:37,068 --> 00:00:37,868
shall be drunken but not with wine, ye

35
00:00:37,868 --> 00:00:38,138
shall stagger but not with strong drink.

36
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:37,971
5 For behold, the Lord hath poured

37
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:37,804
out upon you the spirit of deep

38
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:37,637
sleep. For behold, ye have closed your

39
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:37,47
eyes, and ye have rejected the

40
00:00:37,47 --> 00:00:37,303
prophets; and your rulers, and the seers

41
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:37,671
hath he covered because of your iniquity.

42
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:37,871
6 And it shall come to pass

43
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:38,071
that the Lord God shall bring

44
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:38,271
forth unto you the words of a

45
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:38,471
book, and they shall be the

46
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:38,138
words of them which have slumbered.

47
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:37,938
7 And behold the book shall

48
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:37,738
be sealed; and in the book

49
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:37,538
shall be a revelation from

50
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:37,338
God, from the beginning of the

51
00:00:37,338 --> 00:00:37,671
world to the ending thereof.

52
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:37,796
8 Wherefore, because of

53
00:00:37,796 --> 00:00:37,921
the things which are sealed

54
00:00:37,921 --> 00:00:38,046
up, the things which are

55
00:00:38,046 --> 00:00:38,171
sealed shall not be

56
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:38,296
delivered in the day of the

57
00:00:38,296 --> 00:00:38,421
wickedness and abominations of

58
00:00:38,421 --> 00:00:38,546
the people. Wherefore the

59
00:00:38,546 --> 00:00:38,138
book shall be kept from them.

60
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:38,013
9 But the book shall be

61
00:00:38,013 --> 00:00:37,888
delivered unto a man,

62
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:37,763
and he shall deliver the

63
00:00:37,763 --> 00:00:37,638
words of the book, which

64
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:37,513
are the words of those

65
00:00:37,513 --> 00:00:37,388
who have slumbered in the

66
00:00:37,388 --> 00:00:37,263
dust, and he shall

67
00:00:37,263 --> 00:00:37,671
deliver these words unto another;

68
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:37,738
10 But the words which

69
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:37,805
are sealed he shall not

70
00:00:37,805 --> 00:00:37,872
deliver, neither shall

71
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:37,939
he deliver the book.

72
00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:38,006
For the book shall be

73
00:00:38,006 --> 00:00:38,073
sealed by the power of

74
00:00:38,073 --> 00:00:38,14
God, and the revelation

75
00:00:38,14 --> 00:00:38,207
which was sealed shall

76
00:00:38,207 --> 00:00:38,274
be kept in the book

77
00:00:38,274 --> 00:00:38,341
until the own due time of

78
00:00:38,341 --> 00:00:38,408
the Lord, that they may

79
00:00:38,408 --> 00:00:38,475
come forth; for behold,

80
00:00:38,475 --> 00:00:38,542
they reveal all things

81
00:00:38,542 --> 00:00:38,609
from the foundation of

82
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:38,138
the world unto the end thereof.

83
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:38,067
11 And the day cometh

84
00:00:38,067 --> 00:00:37,996
that the words of the

85
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:37,925
book which were sealed

86
00:00:37,925 --> 00:00:37,854
shall be read upon

87
00:00:37,854 --> 00:00:37,783
the house tops; and they

88
00:00:37,783 --> 00:00:37,712
shall be read by the

89
00:00:37,712 --> 00:00:37,641
power of Christ; and

90
00:00:37,641 --> 00:00:37,57
all things shall be

91
00:00:37,57 --> 00:00:37,499
revealed unto the

92
00:00:37,499 --> 00:00:37,428
children of men which ever

93
00:00:37,428 --> 00:00:37,357
have been among the

94
00:00:37,357 --> 00:00:37,286
children of men, and which

95
00:00:37,286 --> 00:00:37,215
ever will be even

96
00:00:37,215 --> 00:00:37,671
unto the end of the earth.

97
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:37,73
12 Wherefore, at that

98
00:00:37,73 --> 00:00:37,789
day when the book

99
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:37,848
shall be delivered unto

100
00:00:37,848 --> 00:00:37,907
the man of whom I

101
00:00:37,907 --> 00:00:37,966
have spoken, the book

102
00:00:37,966 --> 00:00:38,025
shall be hid from the

103
00:00:38,025 --> 00:00:38,084
eyes of the world,

104
00:00:38,084 --> 00:00:38,143
that the eyes of none

105
00:00:38,143 --> 00:00:38,202
shall behold it save

106
00:00:38,202 --> 00:00:38,261
it be that three

107
00:00:38,261 --> 00:00:38,32
witnesses shall behold it,

108
00:00:38,32 --> 00:00:38,379
by the power of God,

109
00:00:38,379 --> 00:00:38,438
besides him to whom

110
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:38,497
the book shall be

111
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:38,556
delivered; and they

112
00:00:38,556 --> 00:00:38,615
shall testify to the

113
00:00:38,615 --> 00:00:38,138
truth of the book and the things therein.

114
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:38,055
13 And there is none

115
00:00:38,055 --> 00:00:37,972
other which shall

116
00:00:37,972 --> 00:00:37,889
view it, save it be a

117
00:00:37,889 --> 00:00:37,806
few according to

118
00:00:37,806 --> 00:00:37,723
the will of God, to

119
00:00:37,723 --> 00:00:37,64
bear testimony of his

120
00:00:37,64 --> 00:00:37,557
word unto the

121
00:00:37,557 --> 00:00:37,474
children of men; for the

122
00:00:37,474 --> 00:00:37,391
Lord God hath said

123
00:00:37,391 --> 00:00:37,308
that the words of the

124
00:00:37,308 --> 00:00:37,225
faithful should

125
00:00:37,225 --> 00:00:37,671
speak as if it were from the dead.

126
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:37,762
14 Wherefore, the

127
00:00:37,762 --> 00:00:37,853
Lord God will

128
00:00:37,853 --> 00:00:37,944
proceed to bring forth

129
00:00:37,944 --> 00:00:38,035
the words of the

130
00:00:38,035 --> 00:00:38,126
book; and in the mouth

131
00:00:38,126 --> 00:00:38,217
of as many

132
00:00:38,217 --> 00:00:38,308
witnesses as seemeth him

133
00:00:38,308 --> 00:00:38,399
good will he

134
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:38,49
establish his word; and wo

135
00:00:38,49 --> 00:00:38,581
be unto him that

136
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:38,138
rejecteth the word of God!

137
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:38,079
15 But behold, it

138
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:38,02
shall come to pass

139
00:00:38,02 --> 00:00:37,961
that the Lord God

140
00:00:37,961 --> 00:00:37,902
shall say unto

141
00:00:37,902 --> 00:00:37,843
him to whom he shall

142
00:00:37,843 --> 00:00:37,784
deliver the book:

143
00:00:37,784 --> 00:00:37,725
Take these words

144
00:00:37,725 --> 00:00:37,666
which are not

145
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:37,607
sealed and deliver

146
00:00:37,607 --> 00:00:37,548
them to another, that

147
00:00:37,548 --> 00:00:37,489
he may show them

148
00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:37,43
unto the learned,

149
00:00:37,43 --> 00:00:37,371
saying: Read this,

150
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:37,312
I pray thee. And

151
00:00:37,312 --> 00:00:37,253
the learned shall

152
00:00:37,253 --> 00:00:37,194
say: Bring hither

153
00:00:37,194 --> 00:00:37,671
the book, and I will read them.

154
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:37,814
16 And now,

155
00:00:37,814 --> 00:00:37,957
because of the

156
00:00:37,957 --> 00:00:38,1
glory of the world

157
00:00:38,1 --> 00:00:38,243
and to get

158
00:00:38,243 --> 00:00:38,386
gain will they say

159
00:00:38,386 --> 00:00:38,529
this, and not

160
00:00:38,529 --> 00:00:38,138
for the glory of God.

161
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:37,938
17 And the

162
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:37,738
man shall say:

163
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:37,538
I cannot

164
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:37,338
bring the book,

165
00:00:37,338 --> 00:00:37,671
for it is sealed.

166
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:37,921
18 Then

167
00:00:37,921 --> 00:00:38,171
shall the

168
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:38,421
learned say: I

169
00:00:38,421 --> 00:00:38,138
cannot read it.

170
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:38,076
19 Wherefore

171
00:00:38,076 --> 00:00:38,014
it shall

172
00:00:38,014 --> 00:00:37,952
come to pass,

173
00:00:37,952 --> 00:00:37,89
that the

174
00:00:37,89 --> 00:00:37,828
Lord God will

175
00:00:37,828 --> 00:00:37,766
deliver again

176
00:00:37,766 --> 00:00:37,704
the book

177
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:37,642
and the words

178
00:00:37,642 --> 00:00:37,58
thereof to

179
00:00:37,58 --> 00:00:37,518
him that is

180
00:00:37,518 --> 00:00:37,456
not learned;

181
00:00:37,456 --> 00:00:37,394
and the man

182
00:00:37,394 --> 00:00:37,332
that is not

183
00:00:37,332 --> 00:00:37,27
learned

184
00:00:37,27 --> 00:00:37,208
shall say: I am

185
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:37,671
not learned.

186
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:37,73
20 Then

187
00:00:37,73 --> 00:00:37,789
shall the Lord

188
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:37,848
God say

189
00:00:37,848 --> 00:00:37,907
unto him: The

190
00:00:37,907 --> 00:00:37,966
learned

191
00:00:37,966 --> 00:00:38,025
shall not

192
00:00:38,025 --> 00:00:38,084
read them, for

193
00:00:38,084 --> 00:00:38,143
they have

194
00:00:38,143 --> 00:00:38,202
rejected

195
