1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 27 Darkness and apostasy will cover the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
earth in the last days—The Book of Mormon will

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
come forth—Three witnesses will testify of the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
book—The learned man will say he cannot read the

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
sealed book—The Lord will do a marvelous work and

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:07:57,
a wonder—Compare 
Isaiah 29. About 559–545 B.C. 

7
00:07:57,0 --> 00:07:57,0
1 But, behold, in the last days, or in the

8
00:07:57,0 --> 00:07:57,0
days of the Gentiles—yea, behold all the nations

9
00:07:57,0 --> 00:07:57,0
of the Gentiles and also the Jews, both those

10
00:07:57,0 --> 00:07:57,0
who shall come upon this land and those who

11
00:07:57,0 --> 00:07:57,0
shall be upon other lands, yea, even upon all

12
00:07:57,0 --> 00:07:57,0
the lands of the earth, behold, they will be

13
00:07:57,0 --> 00:08:27,
drunken with iniquity and all manner of abominations—

14
00:08:27,0 --> 00:08:27,0
2 And when that day shall come they

15
00:08:27,0 --> 00:08:27,0
shall be visited of the Lord of Hosts, with

16
00:08:27,0 --> 00:08:27,0
thunder and with earthquake, and with a

17
00:08:27,0 --> 00:08:27,0
great noise, and with storm, and with

18
00:08:27,0 --> 00:12:39,
tempest, and with the flame of devouring fire.

19
00:12:39,0 --> 00:12:39,0
3 And all the nations that fight

20
00:12:39,0 --> 00:12:39,0
against Zion, and that distress her, shall

21
00:12:39,0 --> 00:12:39,0
be as a dream of a night vision; yea,

22
00:12:39,0 --> 00:12:39,0
it shall be unto them, even as unto a

23
00:12:39,0 --> 00:12:39,0
hungry man which dreameth, and behold

24
00:12:39,0 --> 00:12:39,0
he eateth but he awaketh and his soul

25
00:12:39,0 --> 00:12:39,0
is empty; or like unto a thirsty man

26
00:12:39,0 --> 00:12:39,0
which dreameth, and behold he drinketh

27
00:12:39,0 --> 00:12:39,0
but he awaketh and behold he is faint,

28
00:12:39,0 --> 00:12:39,0
and his soul hath appetite; yea, even

29
00:12:39,0 --> 00:12:39,0
so shall the multitude of all the

30
00:12:39,0 --> 00:24:49,
nations be that fight against Mount Zion.

31
00:24:49,0 --> 00:24:49,0
4 For behold, all ye that doeth

32
00:24:49,0 --> 00:24:49,0
iniquity, stay yourselves and wonder, for

33
00:24:49,0 --> 00:24:49,0
ye shall cry out, and cry; yea, ye

34
00:24:49,0 --> 00:24:49,0
shall be drunken but not with wine, ye

35
00:24:49,0 --> 00:24:21,
shall stagger but not with strong drink.

36
00:24:21,0 --> 00:24:21,0
5 For behold, the Lord hath poured

37
00:24:21,0 --> 00:24:21,0
out upon you the spirit of deep

38
00:24:21,0 --> 00:24:21,0
sleep. For behold, ye have closed your

39
00:24:21,0 --> 00:24:21,0
eyes, and ye have rejected the

40
00:24:21,0 --> 00:24:21,0
prophets; and your rulers, and the seers

41
00:24:21,0 --> 00:27:17,
hath he covered because of your iniquity.

42
00:27:17,0 --> 00:27:17,0
6 And it shall come to pass

43
00:27:17,0 --> 00:27:17,0
that the Lord God shall bring

44
00:27:17,0 --> 00:27:17,0
forth unto you the words of a

45
00:27:17,0 --> 00:27:17,0
book, and they shall be the

46
00:27:17,0 --> 00:27:03,
words of them which have slumbered.

47
00:27:03,0 --> 00:27:03,0
7 And behold the book shall

48
00:27:03,0 --> 00:27:03,0
be sealed; and in the book

49
00:27:03,0 --> 00:27:03,0
shall be a revelation from

50
00:27:03,0 --> 00:27:03,0
God, from the beginning of the

51
00:27:03,0 --> 00:29:01,
world to the ending thereof.

52
00:29:01,0 --> 00:29:01,0
8 Wherefore, because of

53
00:29:01,0 --> 00:29:01,0
the things which are sealed

54
00:29:01,0 --> 00:29:01,0
up, the things which are

55
00:29:01,0 --> 00:29:01,0
sealed shall not be

56
00:29:01,0 --> 00:29:01,0
delivered in the day of the

57
00:29:01,0 --> 00:29:01,0
wickedness and abominations of

58
00:29:01,0 --> 00:29:01,0
the people. Wherefore the

59
00:29:01,0 --> 00:28:33,
book shall be kept from them.

60
00:28:33,0 --> 00:28:33,0
9 But the book shall be

61
00:28:33,0 --> 00:28:33,0
delivered unto a man,

62
00:28:33,0 --> 00:28:33,0
and he shall deliver the

63
00:28:33,0 --> 00:28:33,0
words of the book, which

64
00:28:33,0 --> 00:28:33,0
are the words of those

65
00:28:33,0 --> 00:28:33,0
who have slumbered in the

66
00:28:33,0 --> 00:28:33,0
dust, and he shall

67
00:28:33,0 --> 00:28:47,
deliver these words unto another;

68
00:28:47,0 --> 00:28:47,0
10 But the words which

69
00:28:47,0 --> 00:28:47,0
are sealed he shall not

70
00:28:47,0 --> 00:28:47,0
deliver, neither shall

71
00:28:47,0 --> 00:28:47,0
he deliver the book.

72
00:28:47,0 --> 00:28:47,0
For the book shall be

73
00:28:47,0 --> 00:28:47,0
sealed by the power of

74
00:28:47,0 --> 00:28:47,0
God, and the revelation

75
00:28:47,0 --> 00:28:47,0
which was sealed shall

76
00:28:47,0 --> 00:28:47,0
be kept in the book

77
00:28:47,0 --> 00:28:47,0
until the own due time of

78
00:28:47,0 --> 00:28:47,0
the Lord, that they may

79
00:28:47,0 --> 00:28:47,0
come forth; for behold,

80
00:28:47,0 --> 00:28:47,0
they reveal all things

81
00:28:47,0 --> 00:28:47,0
from the foundation of

82
00:28:47,0 --> 00:30:45,
the world unto the end thereof.

83
00:30:45,0 --> 00:30:45,0
11 And the day cometh

84
00:30:45,0 --> 00:30:45,0
that the words of the

85
00:30:45,0 --> 00:30:45,0
book which were sealed

86
00:30:45,0 --> 00:30:45,0
shall be read upon

87
00:30:45,0 --> 00:30:45,0
the house tops; and they

88
00:30:45,0 --> 00:30:45,0
shall be read by the

89
00:30:45,0 --> 00:30:45,0
power of Christ; and

90
00:30:45,0 --> 00:30:45,0
all things shall be

91
00:30:45,0 --> 00:30:45,0
revealed unto the

92
00:30:45,0 --> 00:30:45,0
children of men which ever

93
00:30:45,0 --> 00:30:45,0
have been among the

94
00:30:45,0 --> 00:30:45,0
children of men, and which

95
00:30:45,0 --> 00:30:45,0
ever will be even

96
00:30:45,0 --> 00:30:17,
unto the end of the earth.

97
00:30:17,0 --> 00:30:17,0
12 Wherefore, at that

98
00:30:17,0 --> 00:30:17,0
day when the book

99
00:30:17,0 --> 00:30:17,0
shall be delivered unto

100
00:30:17,0 --> 00:30:17,0
the man of whom I

101
00:30:17,0 --> 00:30:17,0
have spoken, the book

102
00:30:17,0 --> 00:30:17,0
shall be hid from the

103
00:30:17,0 --> 00:30:17,0
eyes of the world,

104
00:30:17,0 --> 00:30:17,0
that the eyes of none

105
00:30:17,0 --> 00:30:17,0
shall behold it save

106
00:30:17,0 --> 00:30:17,0
it be that three

107
00:30:17,0 --> 00:30:17,0
witnesses shall behold it,

108
00:30:17,0 --> 00:30:17,0
by the power of God,

109
00:30:17,0 --> 00:30:17,0
besides him to whom

110
00:30:17,0 --> 00:30:17,0
the book shall be

111
00:30:17,0 --> 00:30:17,0
delivered; and they

112
00:30:17,0 --> 00:30:17,0
shall testify to the

113
00:30:17,0 --> 00:29:49,
truth of the book and the things therein.

114
00:29:49,0 --> 00:29:49,0
13 And there is none

115
00:29:49,0 --> 00:29:49,0
other which shall

116
00:29:49,0 --> 00:29:49,0
view it, save it be a

117
00:29:49,0 --> 00:29:49,0
few according to

118
00:29:49,0 --> 00:29:49,0
the will of God, to

119
00:29:49,0 --> 00:29:49,0
bear testimony of his

120
00:29:49,0 --> 00:29:49,0
word unto the

121
00:29:49,0 --> 00:29:49,0
children of men; for the

122
00:29:49,0 --> 00:29:49,0
Lord God hath said

123
00:29:49,0 --> 00:29:49,0
that the words of the

124
00:29:49,0 --> 00:29:49,0
faithful should

125
00:29:49,0 --> 00:29:21,
speak as if it were from the dead.

126
00:29:21,0 --> 00:29:21,0
14 Wherefore, the

127
00:29:21,0 --> 00:29:21,0
Lord God will

128
00:29:21,0 --> 00:29:21,0
proceed to bring forth

129
00:29:21,0 --> 00:29:21,0
the words of the

130
00:29:21,0 --> 00:29:21,0
book; and in the mouth

131
00:29:21,0 --> 00:29:21,0
of as many

132
00:29:21,0 --> 00:29:21,0
witnesses as seemeth him

133
00:29:21,0 --> 00:29:21,0
good will he

134
00:29:21,0 --> 00:29:21,0
establish his word; and wo

135
00:29:21,0 --> 00:29:21,0
be unto him that

136
00:29:21,0 --> 00:30:19,
rejecteth the word of God!

137
00:30:19,0 --> 00:30:19,0
15 But behold, it

138
00:30:19,0 --> 00:30:19,0
shall come to pass

139
00:30:19,0 --> 00:30:19,0
that the Lord God

140
00:30:19,0 --> 00:30:19,0
shall say unto

141
00:30:19,0 --> 00:30:19,0
him to whom he shall

142
00:30:19,0 --> 00:30:19,0
deliver the book:

143
00:30:19,0 --> 00:30:19,0
Take these words

144
00:30:19,0 --> 00:30:19,0
which are not

145
00:30:19,0 --> 00:30:19,0
sealed and deliver

146
00:30:19,0 --> 00:30:19,0
them to another, that

147
00:30:19,0 --> 00:30:19,0
he may show them

148
00:30:19,0 --> 00:30:19,0
unto the learned,

149
00:30:19,0 --> 00:30:19,0
saying: Read this,

150
00:30:19,0 --> 00:30:19,0
I pray thee. And

151
00:30:19,0 --> 00:30:19,0
the learned shall

152
00:30:19,0 --> 00:30:19,0
say: Bring hither

153
00:30:19,0 --> 00:29:51,
the book, and I will read them.

154
00:29:51,0 --> 00:29:51,0
16 And now,

155
00:29:51,0 --> 00:29:51,0
because of the

156
00:29:51,0 --> 00:29:51,0
glory of the world

157
00:29:51,0 --> 00:29:51,0
and to get

158
00:29:51,0 --> 00:29:51,0
gain will they say

159
00:29:51,0 --> 00:29:51,0
this, and not

160
00:29:51,0 --> 00:29:23,
for the glory of God.

161
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
17 And the

162
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
man shall say:

163
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
I cannot

164
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
bring the book,

165
00:29:23,0 --> 00:28:55,
for it is sealed.

166
00:28:55,0 --> 00:28:55,0
18 Then

167
00:28:55,0 --> 00:28:55,0
shall the

168
00:28:55,0 --> 00:28:55,0
learned say: I

169
00:28:55,0 --> 00:29:09,
cannot read it.

170
00:29:09,0 --> 00:29:09,0
19 Wherefore

171
00:29:09,0 --> 00:29:09,0
it shall

172
00:29:09,0 --> 00:29:09,0
come to pass,

173
00:29:09,0 --> 00:29:09,0
that the

174
00:29:09,0 --> 00:29:09,0
Lord God will

175
00:29:09,0 --> 00:29:09,0
deliver again

176
00:29:09,0 --> 00:29:09,0
the book

177
00:29:09,0 --> 00:29:09,0
and the words

178
00:29:09,0 --> 00:29:09,0
thereof to

179
00:29:09,0 --> 00:29:09,0
him that is

180
00:29:09,0 --> 00:29:09,0
not learned;

181
00:29:09,0 --> 00:29:09,0
and the man

182
00:29:09,0 --> 00:29:09,0
that is not

183
00:29:09,0 --> 00:29:09,0
learned

184
00:29:09,0 --> 00:29:09,0
shall say: I am

185
00:29:09,0 --> 00:28:41,
not learned.

186
00:28:41,0 --> 00:28:41,0
20 Then

187
00:28:41,0 --> 00:28:41,0
shall the Lord

188
00:28:41,0 --> 00:28:41,0
God say

189
00:28:41,0 --> 00:28:41,0
unto him: The

190
00:28:41,0 --> 00:28:41,0
learned

191
00:28:41,0 --> 00:28:41,0
shall not

192
00:28:41,0 --> 00:28:41,0
read them, for

193
00:28:41,0 --> 00:28:41,0
they have

194
00:28:41,0 --> 00:28:41,0
rejected

195
00:28:41,0 --> 00:28:41,0
them, and I

196
00:28:41,0 --> 00:28:41,0
am able to

197
00:28:41,0 --> 00:28:41,0
do mine own

198
00:28:41,0 --> 00:28:41,0
work;

199
00:28:41,0 --> 00:28:41,0
wherefore thou

200
00:28:41,0 --> 00:28:41,0
shalt read

201
00:28:41,0 --> 00:28:41,0
the words

202
00:28:41,0 --> 00:30:53,
which I shall give unto thee.

203
00:30:53,0 --> 00:30:53,0
21 Touch

204
00:30:53,0 --> 00:30:53,0
not the

205
00:30:53,0 --> 00:30:53,0
things which

206
00:30:53,0 --> 00:30:53,0
are

207
00:30:53,0 --> 00:30:53,0
sealed, for I

208
00:30:53,0 --> 00:30:53,0
will bring

209
00:30:53,0 --> 00:30:53,0
them forth

210
00:30:53,0 --> 00:30:53,0
in mine

211
00:30:53,0 --> 00:30:53,0
own due

212
00:30:53,0 --> 00:30:53,0
time; for I

213
00:30:53,0 --> 00:30:53,0
will show

214
00:30:53,0 --> 00:30:53,0
unto the

215
00:30:53,0 --> 00:30:53,0
children of

216
00:30:53,0 --> 00:30:53,0
