1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:04,667
Chapter 31 Nephi tells why Christ was

2
00:00:04,667 --> 00:00:09,334
baptized—Men must follow Christ, be baptized, receive the

3
00:00:09,334 --> 00:00:14,001
Holy Ghost, and endure to the end to be

4
00:00:14,001 --> 00:00:18,668
saved—Repentance and baptism are the gate to the strait and

5
00:00:18,668 --> 00:00:23,335
narrow path—Eternal life comes to those who keep

6
00:00:23,335 --> 00:00:28,862
the commandments after baptism. About 559–545 B.C. 

7
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:31,862
1 And now I, Nephi, make an end of my

8
00:00:31,862 --> 00:00:34,862
prophesying unto you, my beloved brethren. And I

9
00:00:34,862 --> 00:00:37,862
cannot write but a few things, which I know

10
00:00:37,862 --> 00:00:40,862
must surely come to pass; neither can I write

11
00:00:40,862 --> 00:00:43,143
but a few of the words of my brother Jacob.

12
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:45,643
2 Wherefore, the things which I have

13
00:00:45,643 --> 00:00:48,143
written sufficeth me, save it be a

14
00:00:48,143 --> 00:00:50,643
few words which I must speak concerning

15
00:00:50,643 --> 00:00:53,143
the doctrine of Christ; wherefore, I

16
00:00:53,143 --> 00:00:55,643
shall speak unto you plainly,

17
00:00:55,643 --> 00:00:58,158
according to the plainness of my prophesying.

18
00:00:58,158 --> 00:00:58,015
3 For my soul delighteth in

19
00:00:58,015 --> 00:00:57,872
plainness; for after this manner doth

20
00:00:57,872 --> 00:00:57,729
the Lord God work among the children

21
00:00:57,729 --> 00:00:57,586
of men. For the Lord God giveth

22
00:00:57,586 --> 00:00:57,443
light unto the understanding; for

23
00:00:57,443 --> 00:00:57,3
he speaketh unto men according to

24
00:00:57,3 --> 00:00:57,224
their language, unto their understanding.

25
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:57,081
4 Wherefore, I would that ye

26
00:00:57,081 --> 00:00:56,938
should remember that I have

27
00:00:56,938 --> 00:00:56,795
spoken unto you concerning that

28
00:00:56,795 --> 00:00:56,652
prophet which the Lord showed

29
00:00:56,652 --> 00:00:56,509
unto me, that should baptize

30
00:00:56,509 --> 00:00:56,366
the Lamb of God, which should

31
00:00:56,366 --> 00:00:56,29
take away the sins of the world.

32
00:00:56,29 --> 00:00:56,147
5 And now, if the Lamb of

33
00:00:56,147 --> 00:00:56,004
God, he being holy, should

34
00:00:56,004 --> 00:00:55,861
have need to be baptized by

35
00:00:55,861 --> 00:00:55,718
water, to fulfil all

36
00:00:55,718 --> 00:00:55,575
righteousness, O then, how much more

37
00:00:55,575 --> 00:00:55,432
need have we, being unholy,

38
00:00:55,432 --> 00:00:55,355
to be baptized, yea, even by water!

39
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:55,955
6 And now, I would ask of

40
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:56,555
you, my beloved brethren,

41
00:00:56,555 --> 00:00:57,155
wherein the Lamb of God

42
00:00:57,155 --> 00:00:57,755
did fulfil all righteousness

43
00:00:57,755 --> 00:00:58,825
in being baptized by water?

44
00:00:58,825 --> 00:00:58,734
7 Know ye not that he

45
00:00:58,734 --> 00:00:58,643
was holy? But

46
00:00:58,643 --> 00:00:58,552
notwithstanding he being holy, he

47
00:00:58,552 --> 00:00:58,461
showeth unto the children

48
00:00:58,461 --> 00:00:58,37
of men that, according

49
00:00:58,37 --> 00:00:58,279
to the flesh he humbleth

50
00:00:58,279 --> 00:00:58,188
himself before the

51
00:00:58,188 --> 00:00:58,097
Father, and witnesseth unto

52
00:00:58,097 --> 00:00:58,006
the Father that he would

53
00:00:58,006 --> 00:00:57,915
be obedient unto him in

54
00:00:57,915 --> 00:00:57,891
keeping his commandments.

55
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:57,691
8 Wherefore, after

56
00:00:57,691 --> 00:00:57,491
he was baptized with

57
00:00:57,491 --> 00:00:57,291
water the Holy Ghost

58
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:57,091
descended upon him

59
00:00:57,091 --> 00:00:56,957
in the form of a dove.

60
00:00:56,957 --> 00:00:56,957
9 And again, it

61
00:00:56,957 --> 00:00:56,957
showeth unto the

62
00:00:56,957 --> 00:00:56,957
children of men the

63
00:00:56,957 --> 00:00:56,957
straitness of the path,

64
00:00:56,957 --> 00:00:56,957
and the narrowness

65
00:00:56,957 --> 00:00:56,957
of the gate, by

66
00:00:56,957 --> 00:00:56,957
which they should

67
00:00:56,957 --> 00:00:56,957
enter, he having set

68
00:00:56,957 --> 00:00:56,49
the example before them.

69
00:00:56,49 --> 00:00:56,49
10 And he said

70
00:00:56,49 --> 00:00:56,49
unto the children

71
00:00:56,49 --> 00:00:56,49
of men: Follow

72
00:00:56,49 --> 00:00:56,49
thou me. Wherefore,

73
00:00:56,49 --> 00:00:56,49
my beloved

74
00:00:56,49 --> 00:00:56,49
brethren, can we follow

75
00:00:56,49 --> 00:00:56,49
Jesus save we

76
00:00:56,49 --> 00:00:56,49
shall be willing to

77
00:00:56,49 --> 00:00:56,49
keep the

78
00:00:56,49 --> 00:00:56,023
commandments of the Father?

79
00:00:56,023 --> 00:00:55,856
11 And the

80
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:55,689
Father said: Repent

81
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:55,522
ye, repent ye,

82
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:55,355
and be

83
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:55,188
baptized in the name

84
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:55,556
of my Beloved Son.

85
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:55,823
12 And also,

86
00:00:55,823 --> 00:00:56,09
the voice of

87
00:00:56,09 --> 00:00:56,357
the Son came

88
00:00:56,357 --> 00:00:56,623
unto me, saying:

89
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:56,891
He that is

90
00:00:56,891 --> 00:00:57,157
baptized in my

91
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,425
name, to him

92
00:00:57,425 --> 00:00:57,692
will the Father

93
00:00:57,692 --> 00:00:57,959
give the Holy

94
00:00:57,959 --> 00:00:58,226
Ghost, like

95
00:00:58,226 --> 00:00:58,492
unto me;

96
00:00:58,492 --> 00:00:58,76
wherefore, follow me,

97
00:00:58,76 --> 00:00:59,026
and do the

98
00:00:59,026 --> 00:00:59,294
things which ye

99
00:00:59,294 --> 00:00:59,026
have seen me do.

100
00:00:59,026 --> 00:00:59,002
13 Wherefore,

101
00:00:59,002 --> 00:00:58,978
my beloved

102
00:00:58,978 --> 00:00:58,954
brethren, I

103
00:00:58,954 --> 00:00:58,93
know that if ye

104
00:00:58,93 --> 00:00:58,906
shall follow

105
00:00:58,906 --> 00:00:58,882
the Son,

106
00:00:58,882 --> 00:00:58,858
with full

107
00:00:58,858 --> 00:00:58,834
purpose of heart,

108
00:00:58,834 --> 00:00:58,81
acting no

109
00:00:58,81 --> 00:00:58,786
hypocrisy and no

110
00:00:58,786 --> 00:00:58,762
deception

111
00:00:58,762 --> 00:00:58,738
before God, but

112
00:00:58,738 --> 00:00:58,714
with real

113
00:00:58,714 --> 00:00:58,69
intent,

114
00:00:58,69 --> 00:00:58,666
repenting of your

115
00:00:58,666 --> 00:00:58,642
sins, witnessing

116
00:00:58,642 --> 00:00:58,618
unto the

117
00:00:58,618 --> 00:00:58,594
Father that ye

118
00:00:58,594 --> 00:00:58,57
are willing to

119
00:00:58,57 --> 00:00:58,546
take upon

120
00:00:58,546 --> 00:00:58,522
you the name of

121
00:00:58,522 --> 00:00:58,498
Christ, by

122
00:00:58,498 --> 00:00:58,474
baptism—yea,

123
00:00:58,474 --> 00:00:58,45
by following

124
00:00:58,45 --> 00:00:58,426
your Lord and

125
00:00:58,426 --> 00:00:58,402
your Savior

126
00:00:58,402 --> 00:00:58,378
down into the

127
00:00:58,378 --> 00:00:58,354
water,

128
00:00:58,354 --> 00:00:58,33
according to his

129
00:00:58,33 --> 00:00:58,306
word, behold,

130
00:00:58,306 --> 00:00:58,282
then shall ye

131
00:00:58,282 --> 00:00:58,258
receive the

132
00:00:58,258 --> 00:00:58,234
Holy Ghost;

133
00:00:58,234 --> 00:00:58,21
yea, then

134
00:00:58,21 --> 00:00:58,186
cometh the baptism

135
00:00:58,186 --> 00:00:58,162
of fire and

136
00:00:58,162 --> 00:00:58,138
of the Holy

137
00:00:58,138 --> 00:00:58,114
Ghost; and

138
00:00:58,114 --> 00:00:58,09
then can ye

139
00:00:58,09 --> 00:00:58,066
speak with the

140
00:00:58,066 --> 00:00:58,042
tongue of

141
00:00:58,042 --> 00:00:58,091
angels, and shout praises unto the Holy One of Israel.

142
00:00:58,091 --> 00:00:58,062
14 But,

143
00:00:58,062 --> 00:00:58,033
behold, my

144
00:00:58,033 --> 00:00:58,004
beloved brethren,

145
00:00:58,004 --> 00:00:57,975
thus came

146
00:00:57,975 --> 00:00:57,946
the voice of

147
00:00:57,946 --> 00:00:57,917
the Son unto

148
00:00:57,917 --> 00:00:57,888
me, saying:

149
00:00:57,888 --> 00:00:57,859
After ye

150
00:00:57,859 --> 00:00:57,83
have repented

151
00:00:57,83 --> 00:00:57,801
of your

152
00:00:57,801 --> 00:00:57,772
sins, and

153
00:00:57,772 --> 00:00:57,743
witnessed unto the

154
00:00:57,743 --> 00:00:57,714
Father that

155
00:00:57,714 --> 00:00:57,685
ye are

156
00:00:57,685 --> 00:00:57,656
willing to keep

157
00:00:57,656 --> 00:00:57,627
my

158
00:00:57,627 --> 00:00:57,598
commandments, by the

159
00:00:57,598 --> 00:00:57,569
baptism of

160
00:00:57,569 --> 00:00:57,54
water, and

161
00:00:57,54 --> 00:00:57,511
have received

162
00:00:57,511 --> 00:00:57,482
the baptism

163
00:00:57,482 --> 00:00:57,453
of fire and

164
00:00:57,453 --> 00:00:57,424
of the Holy

165
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:57,395
Ghost, and

166
00:00:57,395 --> 00:00:57,366
can speak

167
00:00:57,366 --> 00:00:57,337
with a new

168
00:00:57,337 --> 00:00:57,308
tongue, yea,

169
00:00:57,308 --> 00:00:57,279
even with the

170
00:00:57,279 --> 00:00:57,25
tongue of

171
00:00:57,25 --> 00:00:57,221
angels, and

172
00:00:57,221 --> 00:00:57,192
after this

173
00:00:57,192 --> 00:00:57,163
should deny me,

174
00:00:57,163 --> 00:00:57,134
it would

175
00:00:57,134 --> 00:00:57,105
have been

176
00:00:57,105 --> 00:00:57,157
better for you that ye had not known me.

177
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,234
15 And I

178
00:00:57,234 --> 00:00:57,311
heard a voice

179
00:00:57,311 --> 00:00:57,388
from the

180
00:00:57,388 --> 00:00:57,465
Father,

181
00:00:57,465 --> 00:00:57,542
saying: Yea,

182
00:00:57,542 --> 00:00:57,619
the words of

183
00:00:57,619 --> 00:00:57,696
my Beloved

184
00:00:57,696 --> 00:00:57,773
are true

185
00:00:57,773 --> 00:00:57,85
and faithful.

186
00:00:57,85 --> 00:00:57,927
He that

187
00:00:57,927 --> 00:00:58,004
endureth to

188
00:00:58,004 --> 00:00:58,081
the end, the

189
00:00:58,081 --> 00:00:58,158
same shall be saved.

190
00:00:58,158 --> 00:00:58,091
16 And now,

191
00:00:58,091 --> 00:00:58,024
my beloved

192
00:00:58,024 --> 00:00:57,957
brethren,

193
00:00:57,957 --> 00:00:57,89
I know by

194
00:00:57,89 --> 00:00:57,823
this that

195
00:00:57,823 --> 00:00:57,756
unless a man

196
00:00:57,756 --> 00:00:57,689
shall

197
00:00:57,689 --> 00:00:57,622
endure to the

198
00:00:57,622 --> 00:00:57,555
end, in

199
00:00:57,555 --> 00:00:57,488
following the

200
00:00:57,488 --> 00:00:57,421
example of

201
00:00:57,421 --> 00:00:57,354
