1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,167
Chapter 31 Nephi tells why Christ was baptized—Men

2
00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:02,334
 must follow Christ, be baptized, receive the Holy

3
00:00:02,334 --> 00:00:03,501
 Ghost, and endure to the end to be

4
00:00:03,501 --> 00:00:04,668
 saved—Repentance and baptism are the gate to the strait and

5
00:00:04,668 --> 00:00:05,835
 narrow path—Eternal life comes to those who keep the

6
00:00:05,835 --> 00:00:07,002
 commandments after baptism. About 559–545 B.C.

7
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,575
1 And now I, Nephi, make an end of my prophesying

8
00:00:09,575 --> 00:00:11,175
 unto you, my beloved brethren. And I cannot write

9
00:00:11,175 --> 00:00:12,775
 but a few things, which I know must surely come to

10
00:00:12,775 --> 00:00:14,375
 pass; neither can I write but a few of the words

11
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:15,975
 of my brother Jacob

12
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,549
2 Wherefore, the things which I have written

13
00:00:17,549 --> 00:00:19,149
 sufficeth me, save it be a few words which I must speak

14
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:20,749
 concerning the doctrine of Christ; wherefore, I

15
00:00:20,749 --> 00:00:22,349
 shall speak unto you plainly, according to the

16
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:23,949
 plainness of my prophesying

17
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,524
3 For my soul delighteth in plainness; for after

18
00:00:25,524 --> 00:00:27,124
 this manner doth the Lord God work among the

19
00:00:27,124 --> 00:00:28,724
 children of men. For the Lord God giveth light unto the

20
00:00:28,724 --> 00:00:30,324
 understanding; for he speaketh unto men according

21
00:00:30,324 --> 00:00:31,924
 to their language, unto their understanding

22
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,499
4 Wherefore, I would that ye should remember that

23
00:00:33,499 --> 00:00:35,099
 I have spoken unto you concerning that prophet

24
00:00:35,099 --> 00:00:36,699
 which the Lord showed unto me, that should baptize

25
00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:38,299
 the Lamb of God, which should take away the sins of

26
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:39,899
 the world

27
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,473
5 And now, if the Lamb of God, he being holy,

28
00:00:41,473 --> 00:00:43,073
 should have need to be baptized by water, to fulfil

29
00:00:43,073 --> 00:00:44,673
 all righteousness, O then, how much more need have

30
00:00:44,673 --> 00:00:46,273
 we, being unholy, to be baptized, yea, even by

31
00:00:46,273 --> 00:00:47,873
 water

32
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:50,515
6 And now, I would ask of you, my beloved

33
00:00:50,515 --> 00:00:53,182
 brethren, wherein the Lamb of God did fulfil all

34
00:00:53,182 --> 00:00:55,849
 righteousness in being baptized by water

35
00:00:55,822 --> 00:02:04,989
7 Know ye not that he was holy? But

36
00:02:04,989 --> 00:03:14,156
 notwithstanding he being holy, he showeth unto the children of

37
00:03:14,156 --> 00:04:23,323
 men that, according to the flesh he humbleth

38
00:04:23,323 --> 00:05:32,49
 himself before the Father, and witnesseth unto the

39
00:05:32,49 --> 00:06:41,657
 Father that he would be obedient unto him in keeping

40
00:06:41,657 --> 00:07:50,824
 his commandments

41
00:07:50,503 --> 00:08:17,17
8 Wherefore, after he was baptized with water the

42
00:08:17,17 --> 00:08:43,837
 Holy Ghost descended upon him in the form of a

43
00:08:43,837 --> 00:09:10,504
 dove

44
00:09:10,25 --> 00:09:33,0
9 And again, it showeth unto the children of men

45
00:09:33,0 --> 00:09:57,75
 the straitness of the path, and the narrowness of

46
00:09:57,75 --> 00:10:21,5
 the gate, by which they should enter, he having set

47
00:10:21,5 --> 00:10:45,25
 the example before them

48
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:53,945
10 And he said unto the children of men: Follow

49
00:10:53,945 --> 00:11:01,945
 thou me. Wherefore, my beloved brethren, can we

50
00:11:01,945 --> 00:11:09,945
 follow Jesus save we shall be willing to keep the

51
00:11:09,945 --> 00:11:17,945
 commandments of the Father

52
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:25,844
11 And the Father said: Repent ye, repent ye, and

53
00:11:25,844 --> 00:11:33,844
 be baptized in the name of my Beloved Son

54
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:08,864
14 But, behold, my beloved brethren, thus came the

55
00:00:08,864 --> 00:00:09,753
 voice of the Son unto me, saying: After ye have

56
00:00:09,753 --> 00:00:10,642
 repented of your sins, and witnessed unto the

57
00:00:10,642 --> 00:00:11,531
 Father that ye are willing to keep my commandments, by

58
00:00:11,531 --> 00:00:12,42
 the baptism of water, and have received the

59
00:00:12,42 --> 00:00:13,309
 baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost, and can speak

60
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:14,198
 with a new tongue, yea, even with the tongue of

61
00:00:14,198 --> 00:00:15,087
 angels, and after this should deny me, it would have

62
00:00:15,087 --> 00:00:15,976
 been better for you that ye had not known me

63
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,949
15 And I heard a voice from the Father, saying:

64
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:19,949
 Yea, the words of my Beloved are true and faithful.

65
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:21,949
 He that endureth to the end, the same shall be

66
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:23,949
 saved

67
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,924
16 And now, my beloved brethren, I know by this

68
00:00:25,924 --> 00:00:27,924
 that unless a man shall endure to the end, in

69
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:29,924
 following the example of the Son of the living God, he

70
00:00:29,924 --> 00:00:31,924
 cannot be saved

71
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:32,899
17 Wherefore, do the things which I have told you

72
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:33,899
 I have seen that your Lord and your Redeemer

73
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:34,899
 should do; for, for this cause have they been shown

74
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:35,899
 unto me, that ye might know the gate by which ye

75
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:36,899
 should enter. For the gate by which ye should enter is

76
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:37,899
 repentance and baptism by water; and then cometh

77
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:38,899
 a remission of your sins by fire and by the Holy

78
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:39,899
 Ghost

79
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:40,873
18 And then are ye in this strait and narrow path

80
00:00:40,873 --> 00:00:41,873
 which leads to eternal life; yea, ye have entered

81
00:00:41,873 --> 00:00:42,873
 in by the gate; ye have done according to the

82
00:00:42,873 --> 00:00:43,873
 commandments of the Father and the Son; and ye have

83
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:44,873
 received the Holy Ghost, which witnesses of the

84
00:00:44,873 --> 00:00:45,873
 Father and the Son, unto the fulfilling of the promise

85
00:00:45,873 --> 00:00:46,873
 which he hath made, that if ye entered in by the

86
00:00:46,873 --> 00:00:47,873
 way ye should receive

87
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,181
19 And now, my beloved brethren, after ye have

88
00:00:49,181 --> 00:00:50,514
 gotten into this strait and narrow path, I would ask

89
00:00:50,514 --> 00:00:51,847
 if all is done? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for

90
00:00:51,847 --> 00:00:53,18
 ye have not come thus far save it were by the word

91
00:00:53,18 --> 00:00:54,513
 of Christ with unshaken faith in him, relying

92
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:55,846
 wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to save

93
00:00:55,822 --> 00:02:04,989
20 Wherefore, ye must press forward with a

94
00:02:04,989 --> 00:03:14,156
 steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of

95
00:03:14,156 --> 00:04:23,323
 hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore,

96
00:04:23,323 --> 00:05:32,49
 if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word

97
00:05:32,49 --> 00:06:41,657
 of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus

98
00:06:41,657 --> 00:07:50,824
 saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life

99
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:50,503
21 And now, behold, my beloved brethren, this is

100
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:50,503
 the way; and there is none other way nor name given

101
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:50,503
 under heaven whereby man can be saved in the

102
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:50,503
 kingdom of God. And now, behold, this is the doctrine

103
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:50,503
 of Christ, and the only and true doctrine of the

104
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:50,503
 Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,

105
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:50,503
 which is one God, without end. Amen.
