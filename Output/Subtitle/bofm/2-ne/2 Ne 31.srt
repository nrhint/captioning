1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 31 Nephi tells why Christ was

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
baptized—Men must follow Christ, be baptized, receive the

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Holy Ghost, and endure to the end to be

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
saved—Repentance and baptism are the gate to the strait and

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
narrow path—Eternal life comes to those who keep

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:04:29,
the commandments after baptism. About 559–545 B.C. 

7
00:04:29,0 --> 00:04:29,0
1 And now I, Nephi, make an end of my

8
00:04:29,0 --> 00:04:29,0
prophesying unto you, my beloved brethren. And I

9
00:04:29,0 --> 00:04:29,0
cannot write but a few things, which I know

10
00:04:29,0 --> 00:04:29,0
must surely come to pass; neither can I write

11
00:04:29,0 --> 00:04:01,
but a few of the words of my brother Jacob.

12
00:04:01,0 --> 00:04:01,0
2 Wherefore, the things which I have

13
00:04:01,0 --> 00:04:01,0
written sufficeth me, save it be a

14
00:04:01,0 --> 00:04:01,0
few words which I must speak concerning

15
00:04:01,0 --> 00:04:01,0
the doctrine of Christ; wherefore, I

16
00:04:01,0 --> 00:04:01,0
shall speak unto you plainly,

17
00:04:01,0 --> 00:11:10,
according to the plainness of my prophesying.

18
00:11:10,0 --> 00:11:10,0
3 For my soul delighteth in

19
00:11:10,0 --> 00:11:10,0
plainness; for after this manner doth

20
00:11:10,0 --> 00:11:10,0
the Lord God work among the children

21
00:11:10,0 --> 00:11:10,0
of men. For the Lord God giveth

22
00:11:10,0 --> 00:11:10,0
light unto the understanding; for

23
00:11:10,0 --> 00:11:10,0
he speaketh unto men according to

24
00:11:10,0 --> 00:12:54,
their language, unto their understanding.

25
00:12:54,0 --> 00:12:54,0
4 Wherefore, I would that ye

26
00:12:54,0 --> 00:12:54,0
should remember that I have

27
00:12:54,0 --> 00:12:54,0
spoken unto you concerning that

28
00:12:54,0 --> 00:12:54,0
prophet which the Lord showed

29
00:12:54,0 --> 00:12:54,0
unto me, that should baptize

30
00:12:54,0 --> 00:12:54,0
the Lamb of God, which should

31
00:12:54,0 --> 00:29:47,
take away the sins of the world.

32
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
5 And now, if the Lamb of

33
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
God, he being holy, should

34
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
have need to be baptized by

35
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
water, to fulfil all

36
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
righteousness, O then, how much more

37
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
need have we, being unholy,

38
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:19,
to be baptized, yea, even by water!

39
00:29:19,0 --> 00:29:19,0
6 And now, I would ask of

40
00:29:19,0 --> 00:29:19,0
you, my beloved brethren,

41
00:29:19,0 --> 00:29:19,0
wherein the Lamb of God

42
00:29:19,0 --> 00:29:19,0
did fulfil all righteousness

43
00:29:19,0 --> 00:28:51,
in being baptized by water?

44
00:28:51,0 --> 00:28:51,0
7 Know ye not that he

45
00:28:51,0 --> 00:28:51,0
was holy? But

46
00:28:51,0 --> 00:28:51,0
notwithstanding he being holy, he

47
00:28:51,0 --> 00:28:51,0
showeth unto the children

48
00:28:51,0 --> 00:28:51,0
of men that, according

49
00:28:51,0 --> 00:28:51,0
to the flesh he humbleth

50
00:28:51,0 --> 00:28:51,0
himself before the

51
00:28:51,0 --> 00:28:51,0
Father, and witnesseth unto

52
00:28:51,0 --> 00:28:51,0
the Father that he would

53
00:28:51,0 --> 00:28:51,0
be obedient unto him in

54
00:28:51,0 --> 00:28:23,
keeping his commandments.

55
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
8 Wherefore, after

56
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
he was baptized with

57
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
water the Holy Ghost

58
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
descended upon him

59
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:09,
in the form of a dove.

60
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
9 And again, it

61
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
showeth unto the

62
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
children of men the

63
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
straitness of the path,

64
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
and the narrowness

65
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
of the gate, by

66
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
which they should

67
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
enter, he having set

68
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:23,
the example before them.

69
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
10 And he said

70
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
unto the children

71
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
of men: Follow

72
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
thou me. Wherefore,

73
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
my beloved

74
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
brethren, can we follow

75
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
Jesus save we

76
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
shall be willing to

77
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
keep the

78
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:09,
commandments of the Father?

79
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
11 And the

80
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
Father said: Repent

81
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
ye, repent ye,

82
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
and be

83
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
baptized in the name

84
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:23,
of my Beloved Son.

85
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
12 And also,

86
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
the voice of

87
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
the Son came

88
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
unto me, saying:

89
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
He that is

90
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
baptized in my

91
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
name, to him

92
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
will the Father

93
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
give the Holy

94
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
Ghost, like

95
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
unto me;

96
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
wherefore, follow me,

97
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
and do the

98
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
things which ye

99
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:09,
have seen me do.

100
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
13 Wherefore,

101
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
my beloved

102
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
brethren, I

103
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
know that if ye

104
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
shall follow

105
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
the Son,

106
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
with full

107
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
purpose of heart,

108
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
acting no

109
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
hypocrisy and no

110
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
deception

111
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
before God, but

112
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
with real

113
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
intent,

114
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
repenting of your

115
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
sins, witnessing

116
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
unto the

117
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
Father that ye

118
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
are willing to

119
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
take upon

120
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
you the name of

121
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
Christ, by

122
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
baptism—yea,

123
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
by following

124
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
your Lord and

125
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
your Savior

126
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
down into the

127
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
water,

128
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
according to his

129
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
word, behold,

130
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
then shall ye

131
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
receive the

132
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
Holy Ghost;

133
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
yea, then

134
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
cometh the baptism

135
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
of fire and

136
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
of the Holy

137
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
Ghost; and

138
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
then can ye

139
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
speak with the

140
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
tongue of

141
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:23,
angels, and shout praises unto the Holy One of Israel.

142
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
14 But,

143
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
behold, my

144
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
beloved brethren,

145
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
thus came

146
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
the voice of

147
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
the Son unto

148
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
me, saying:

149
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
After ye

150
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
have repented

151
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
of your

152
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
sins, and

153
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
witnessed unto the

154
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
Father that

155
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
ye are

156
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
willing to keep

157
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
my

158
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
commandments, by the

159
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
baptism of

160
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
water, and

161
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
have received

162
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
the baptism

163
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
of fire and

164
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
of the Holy

165
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
Ghost, and

166
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
can speak

167
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
with a new

168
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
tongue, yea,

169
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
even with the

170
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
tongue of

171
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
angels, and

172
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
after this

173
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
should deny me,

174
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
it would

175
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
have been

176
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:09,
better for you that ye had not known me.

177
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
15 And I

178
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
heard a voice

179
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
from the

180
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
Father,

181
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
saying: Yea,

182
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
the words of

183
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
my Beloved

184
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
are true

185
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
and faithful.

186
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
He that

187
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
endureth to

188
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
the end, the

189
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:23,
same shall be saved.

190
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
16 And now,

191
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
my beloved

192
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
brethren,

193
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
I know by

194
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
this that

195
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
unless a man

196
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
shall

197
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
endure to the

198
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
end, in

199
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
following the

200
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
example of

201
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
the Son of

202
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
the living

203
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
God, he

204
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:09,
cannot be saved.

205
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
17

206
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
Wherefore, do the

207
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
things

208
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
which I have

209
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
told you

210
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
I have

211
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
seen that

212
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
your Lord and

213
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
your

214
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
Redeemer

215
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
should do; for,

216
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
for this

217
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
cause have

218
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
they been

219
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
shown

220
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
unto me, that

221
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
ye might

222
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
