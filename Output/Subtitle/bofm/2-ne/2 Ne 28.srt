00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,167
Chapter 28 Many false churches will be built up in

2
00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:02,334
 the last days—They will teach false, vain, and

3
00:00:02,334 --> 00:00:03,501
 foolish doctrines—Apostasy will abound because of

4
00:00:03,501 --> 00:00:04,668
 false teachers—The devil will rage in the hearts of

5
00:00:04,668 --> 00:00:05,835
 men—He will teach all manner of false doctrines.

6
00:00:05,835 --> 00:00:07,002
 About 559–545 B.C.

7
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,975
1 And now, behold, my brethren, I have spoken unto

8
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:11,975
 you, according as the Spirit hath constrained me;

9
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:13,975
 wherefore, I know that they must surely come to

10
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:15,975
 pass

11
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,949
2 And the things which shall be written out of the

12
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:19,949
 book shall be of great worth unto the children of

13
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:21,949
 men, and especially unto our seed, which is a

14
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:23,949
 remnant of the house of Israel

15
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,257
3 For it shall come to pass in that day that the

16
00:00:25,257 --> 00:00:26,59
 churches which are built up, and not unto the Lord,

17
00:00:26,59 --> 00:00:27,923
 when the one shall say unto the other: Behold, I,

18
00:00:27,923 --> 00:00:29,256
 I am the Lord’s; and the others shall say: I, I

19
00:00:29,256 --> 00:00:30,589
 am the Lord’s; and thus shall every one say that

20
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:31,922
 hath built up churches, and not unto the Lord

21
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,899
4 And they shall contend one with another; and

22
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,899
 their priests shall contend one with another, and

23
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:37,899
 they shall teach with their learning, and deny the

24
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:39,899
 Holy Ghost, which giveth utterance

25
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,206
5 And they deny the power of God, the Holy One of

26
00:00:41,206 --> 00:00:42,539
 Israel; and they say unto the people: Hearken unto

27
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:43,872
 us, and hear ye our precept; for behold there is

28
00:00:43,872 --> 00:00:45,205
 no God today, for the Lord and the Redeemer hath

29
00:00:45,205 --> 00:00:46,538
 done his work, and he hath given his power unto

30
00:00:46,538 --> 00:00:47,871
 men

31
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,848
6 Behold, hearken ye unto my precept; if they

32
00:00:49,848 --> 00:00:51,848
 shall say there is a miracle wrought by the hand of

33
00:00:51,848 --> 00:00:53,848
 the Lord, believe it not; for this day he is not a

34
00:00:53,848 --> 00:00:55,848
 God of miracles; he hath done his work

35
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,575
9 Yea, and there shall be many which shall teach

36
00:00:09,575 --> 00:00:11,175
 after this manner, false and vain and foolish

37
00:00:11,175 --> 00:00:12,775
 doctrines, and shall be puffed up in their hearts, and

38
00:00:12,775 --> 00:00:14,375
 shall seek deep to hide their counsels from the

39
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:15,975
 Lord; and their works shall be in the dark

40
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:19,949
10 And the blood of the saints shall cry from the

41
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:23,949
 ground against them

42
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:27,924
11 Yea, they have all gone out of the way; they

43
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:31,924
 have become corrupted

44
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,899
12 Because of pride, and because of false

45
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,899
 teachers, and false doctrine, their churches have become

46
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:37,899
 corrupted, and their churches are lifted up;

47
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:39,899
 because of pride they are puffed up

48
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,873
13 They rob the poor because of their fine

49
00:00:41,873 --> 00:00:43,873
 sanctuaries; they rob the poor because of their fine

50
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:45,873
 clothing; and they persecute the meek and the poor in

51
00:00:45,873 --> 00:00:47,873
 heart, because in their pride they are puffed up

52
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:48,991
14 They wear stiff necks and high heads; yea, and

53
00:00:48,991 --> 00:00:50,134
 because of pride, and wickedness, and

54
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:51,277
 abominations, and whoredoms, they have all gone astray save it

55
00:00:51,277 --> 00:00:52,42
 be a few, who are the humble followers of Christ;

56
00:00:52,42 --> 00:00:53,563
 nevertheless, they are led, that in many

57
00:00:53,563 --> 00:00:54,706
 instances they do err because they are taught by the

58
00:00:54,706 --> 00:00:55,849
 precepts of men

59
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,975
17 But behold, if the inhabitants of the earth

60
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:11,975
 shall repent of their wickedness and abominations

61
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:13,975
 they shall not be destroyed, saith the Lord of Hosts

62
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:15,975


63
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,616
18 But behold, that great and abominable church,

64
00:00:18,616 --> 00:00:21,283
 the whore of all the earth, must tumble to the

65
00:00:21,283 --> 00:00:23,95
 earth, and great must be the fall thereof

66
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,524
19 For the kingdom of the devil must shake, and

67
00:00:25,524 --> 00:00:27,124
 they which belong to it must needs be stirred up

68
00:00:27,124 --> 00:00:28,724
 unto repentance, or the devil will grasp them with

69
00:00:28,724 --> 00:00:30,324
 his everlasting chains, and they be stirred up to

70
00:00:30,324 --> 00:00:31,924
 anger, and perish

71
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:34,566
20 For behold, at that day shall he rage in the

72
00:00:34,566 --> 00:00:37,233
 hearts of the children of men, and stir them up to

73
00:00:37,233 --> 00:00:39,9
 anger against that which is good

74
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,473
21 And others will he pacify, and lull them away

75
00:00:41,473 --> 00:00:43,073
 into carnal security, that they will say: All is

76
00:00:43,073 --> 00:00:44,673
 well in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well—and

77
00:00:44,673 --> 00:00:46,273
 thus the devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth

78
00:00:46,273 --> 00:00:47,873
 them away carefully down to hell

79
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,181
22 And behold, others he flattereth away, and

80
00:00:49,181 --> 00:00:50,514
 telleth them there is no hell; and he saith unto them:

81
00:00:50,514 --> 00:00:51,847
 I am no devil, for there is none—and thus he

82
00:00:51,847 --> 00:00:53,18
 whispereth in their ears, until he grasps them with

83
00:00:53,18 --> 00:00:54,513
 his awful chains, from whence there is no

84
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:55,846
 deliverance

85
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:15,975
25 Wo be unto him that crieth: All is well

86
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,616
26 Yea, wo be unto him that hearkeneth unto the

87
00:00:18,616 --> 00:00:21,283
 precepts of men, and denieth the power of God, and

88
00:00:21,283 --> 00:00:23,95
 the gift of the Holy Ghost

89
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:27,924
27 Yea, wo be unto him that saith: We have

90
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:31,924
 received, and we need no more

91
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,499
28 And in fine, wo unto all those who tremble, and

92
00:00:33,499 --> 00:00:35,099
 are angry because of the truth of God! For

93
00:00:35,099 --> 00:00:36,699
 behold, he that is built upon the rock receiveth it with

94
00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:38,299
 gladness; and he that is built upon a sandy

95
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:39,899
 foundation trembleth lest he shall fall

96
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,54
29 Wo be unto him that shall say: We have received

97
00:00:42,54 --> 00:00:45,207
 the word of God, and we need no more of the word

98
00:00:45,207 --> 00:00:47,874
 of God, for we have enough

99
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:48,737
30 For behold, thus saith the Lord God: I will

100
00:00:48,737 --> 00:00:49,626
 give unto the children of men line upon line, precept

101
00:00:49,626 --> 00:00:50,515
 upon precept, here a little and there a little;

102
00:00:50,515 --> 00:00:51,404
 and blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts,

103
00:00:51,404 --> 00:00:52,293
 and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall

104
00:00:52,293 --> 00:00:53,182
 learn wisdom; for unto him that receiveth I will

105
00:00:53,182 --> 00:00:54,071
 give more; and from them that shall say, We have

106
00:00:54,071 --> 00:00:54,96
 enough, from them shall be taken away even that which

107
00:00:54,96 --> 00:00:55,849
 they have
