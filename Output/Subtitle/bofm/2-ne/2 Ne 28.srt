00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:03,5
Chapter 28 Many false churches will be built

2
00:00:03,5 --> 00:00:07,0
up in the last days—They will teach false,

3
00:00:07,0 --> 00:00:10,5
vain, and foolish doctrines—Apostasy will

4
00:00:10,5 --> 00:00:14,0
abound because of false teachers—The devil

5
00:00:14,0 --> 00:00:17,5
will rage in the hearts of men—He will teach

6
00:00:17,5 --> 00:00:21,321
all manner of false doctrines. About 559–545 B.C. 

7
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:22,071
1 And now, behold, my brethren, I have

8
00:00:22,071 --> 00:00:22,821
spoken unto you, according as the

9
00:00:22,821 --> 00:00:23,571
Spirit hath constrained me; wherefore, I

10
00:00:23,571 --> 00:00:24,791
know that they must surely come to pass.

11
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:27,991
2 And the things which shall be

12
00:00:27,991 --> 00:00:31,191
written out of the book shall be of

13
00:00:31,191 --> 00:00:34,391
great worth unto the children of men,

14
00:00:34,391 --> 00:00:37,591
and especially unto our seed,

15
00:00:37,591 --> 00:00:40,741
which is a remnant of the house of Israel.

16
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
3 For it shall come to pass in

17
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
that day that the churches which

18
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
are built up, and not unto the

19
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
Lord, when the one shall say unto

20
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
the other: Behold, I, I am the

21
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
Lord’s; and the others shall

22
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
say: I, I am the Lord’s; and thus

23
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
shall every one say that hath

24
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
built up churches, and not unto the Lord—

25
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
4 And they shall contend one

26
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
with another; and their priests

27
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
shall contend one with

28
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
another, and they shall teach with

29
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
their learning, and deny the

30
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
Holy Ghost, which giveth utterance.

31
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
5 And they deny the power

32
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
of God, the Holy One of

33
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
Israel; and they say unto the

34
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
people: Hearken unto us, and

35
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
hear ye our precept; for

36
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
behold there is no God

37
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
today, for the Lord and the

38
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
Redeemer hath done his work,

39
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
and he hath given his power unto men;

40
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
6 Behold, hearken ye unto

41
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
my precept; if they shall

42
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
say there is a miracle

43
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
wrought by the hand of the

44
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
Lord, believe it not; for

45
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
this day he is not a God of

46
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
miracles; he hath done his work.

47
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
7 Yea, and there shall

48
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
be many which shall say:

49
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
Eat, drink, and be

50
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
merry, for tomorrow we die;

51
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
and it shall be well with us.

52
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
8 And there shall also

53
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
be many which shall

54
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
say: Eat, drink, and be

55
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
merry; nevertheless,

56
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
fear God—he will

57
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
justify in committing a

58
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
little sin; yea, lie a

59
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
little, take the

60
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
advantage of one because of

61
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
his words, dig a pit

62
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
for thy neighbor; there

63
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
is no harm in this;

64
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
and do all these things,

65
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
for tomorrow we die;

66
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
and if it so be that

67
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
we are guilty, God will

68
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
beat us with a few

69
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
stripes, and at last we

70
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
shall be saved in the kingdom of God.

71
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
9 Yea, and there

72
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
shall be many which shall

73
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
teach after this

74
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
manner, false and vain

75
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
and foolish doctrines,

76
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
and shall be puffed

77
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
up in their hearts,

78
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
and shall seek deep to

79
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
hide their counsels

80
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
from the Lord; and

81
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
their works shall be in the dark.

82
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
10 And the blood

83
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
of the saints

84
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
shall cry from the

85
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
ground against them.

86
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
11 Yea, they

87
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
have all gone

88
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
out of the way;

89
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
they have

90
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
become corrupted.

91
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
12 Because of

92
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
pride, and

93
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
because of

94
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
false teachers,

95
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
and false

96
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
doctrine, their

97
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
churches have

98
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
become

99
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
corrupted, and

100
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
their churches

101
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
are lifted up;

102
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
because of

103
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
pride they are puffed up.

104
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
13 They rob

105
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
the poor

106
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
because of

107
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
their fine

108
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
sanctuaries; they

109
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
rob the

110
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
poor because of

111
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
their fine

112
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
clothing;

113
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
and they

114
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
persecute the

115
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
meek and the

116
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
poor in heart,

117
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
because in

118
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
their pride

119
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
they are puffed up.

120
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
14 They

121
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
wear stiff

122
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
necks and high

123
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
heads;

124
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
yea, and

125
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
because of

126
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
pride, and

127
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
wickedness, and

128
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741


129
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
abominations, and

130
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
whoredoms, they

131
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
have all

132
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
gone astray

133
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
save it be

134
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
a few, who

135
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
are the

136
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
humble

137
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
followers of

138
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
Christ;

139
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
nevertheless, they

140
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
are led,

141
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
that in many

142
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
instances

143
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
they do err

144
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
because

145
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
they are taught by the precepts of men.

146
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
15 O the

147
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
wise, and

148
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
the

149
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
learned, and the

150
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
rich, that

151
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
are

152
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
puffed up in

153
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
the pride of

154
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
their

155
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
hearts, and

156
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
all those

157
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
who preach

158
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
false

159
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
doctrines, and

160
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
all those

161
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
who

162
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
commit

163
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
whoredoms, and

164
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
pervert the

165
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
right way

166
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
of the

167
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
Lord, wo, wo,

168
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
wo be unto

169
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
them,

170
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
saith the

171
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
Lord God

172
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
Almighty, for

173
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
they shall be thrust down to hell!

174
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
16 Wo

175
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
unto them

176
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
that turn

177
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
aside the

178
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
just for

179
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
a thing

180
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
of naught

181
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
and

182
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
revile against

183
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
that

184
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
which is

185
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
good, and

186
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
say that it

187
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
is of no

188
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
worth!

189
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
For the

190
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
day shall

191
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
come that

192
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
the Lord

193
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
God will

194
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
speedily

195
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
visit the

196
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741


197
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
inhabitants of

198
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
the earth;

199
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
and in

200
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,741
that day
