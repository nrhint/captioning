00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 28 Many false churches will be built

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
up in the last days—They will teach false,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
vain, and foolish doctrines—Apostasy will

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
abound because of false teachers—The devil

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
will rage in the hearts of men—He will teach

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:04:13,
all manner of false doctrines. About 559–545 B.C. 

7
00:04:13,0 --> 00:04:13,0
1 And now, behold, my brethren, I have

8
00:04:13,0 --> 00:04:13,0
spoken unto you, according as the

9
00:04:13,0 --> 00:04:13,0
Spirit hath constrained me; wherefore, I

10
00:04:13,0 --> 00:07:58,
know that they must surely come to pass.

11
00:07:58,0 --> 00:07:58,0
2 And the things which shall be

12
00:07:58,0 --> 00:07:58,0
written out of the book shall be of

13
00:07:58,0 --> 00:07:58,0
great worth unto the children of men,

14
00:07:58,0 --> 00:07:58,0
and especially unto our seed,

15
00:07:58,0 --> 00:08:28,
which is a remnant of the house of Israel.

16
00:08:28,0 --> 00:08:28,0
3 For it shall come to pass in

17
00:08:28,0 --> 00:08:28,0
that day that the churches which

18
00:08:28,0 --> 00:08:28,0
are built up, and not unto the

19
00:08:28,0 --> 00:08:28,0
Lord, when the one shall say unto

20
00:08:28,0 --> 00:08:28,0
the other: Behold, I, I am the

21
00:08:28,0 --> 00:08:28,0
Lord’s; and the others shall

22
00:08:28,0 --> 00:08:28,0
say: I, I am the Lord’s; and thus

23
00:08:28,0 --> 00:08:28,0
shall every one say that hath

24
00:08:28,0 --> 00:12:13,
built up churches, and not unto the Lord—

25
00:12:13,0 --> 00:12:13,0
4 And they shall contend one

26
00:12:13,0 --> 00:12:13,0
with another; and their priests

27
00:12:13,0 --> 00:12:13,0
shall contend one with

28
00:12:13,0 --> 00:12:13,0
another, and they shall teach with

29
00:12:13,0 --> 00:12:13,0
their learning, and deny the

30
00:12:13,0 --> 00:11:45,
Holy Ghost, which giveth utterance.

31
00:11:45,0 --> 00:11:45,0
5 And they deny the power

32
00:11:45,0 --> 00:11:45,0
of God, the Holy One of

33
00:11:45,0 --> 00:11:45,0
Israel; and they say unto the

34
00:11:45,0 --> 00:11:45,0
people: Hearken unto us, and

35
00:11:45,0 --> 00:11:45,0
hear ye our precept; for

36
00:11:45,0 --> 00:11:45,0
behold there is no God

37
00:11:45,0 --> 00:11:45,0
today, for the Lord and the

38
00:11:45,0 --> 00:11:45,0
Redeemer hath done his work,

39
00:11:45,0 --> 00:11:17,
and he hath given his power unto men;

40
00:11:17,0 --> 00:11:17,0
6 Behold, hearken ye unto

41
00:11:17,0 --> 00:11:17,0
my precept; if they shall

42
00:11:17,0 --> 00:11:17,0
say there is a miracle

43
00:11:17,0 --> 00:11:17,0
wrought by the hand of the

44
00:11:17,0 --> 00:11:17,0
Lord, believe it not; for

45
00:11:17,0 --> 00:11:17,0
this day he is not a God of

46
00:11:17,0 --> 00:15:45,
miracles; he hath done his work.

47
00:15:45,0 --> 00:15:45,0
7 Yea, and there shall

48
00:15:45,0 --> 00:15:45,0
be many which shall say:

49
00:15:45,0 --> 00:15:45,0
Eat, drink, and be

50
00:15:45,0 --> 00:15:45,0
merry, for tomorrow we die;

51
00:15:45,0 --> 00:19:15,
and it shall be well with us.

52
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
8 And there shall also

53
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
be many which shall

54
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
say: Eat, drink, and be

55
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
merry; nevertheless,

56
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
fear God—he will

57
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
justify in committing a

58
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
little sin; yea, lie a

59
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
little, take the

60
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
advantage of one because of

61
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
his words, dig a pit

62
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
for thy neighbor; there

63
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
is no harm in this;

64
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
and do all these things,

65
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
for tomorrow we die;

66
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
and if it so be that

67
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
we are guilty, God will

68
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
beat us with a few

69
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
stripes, and at last we

70
00:19:15,0 --> 00:23:00,
shall be saved in the kingdom of God.

71
00:23:00,0 --> 00:23:00,0
9 Yea, and there

72
00:23:00,0 --> 00:23:00,0
shall be many which shall

73
00:23:00,0 --> 00:23:00,0
teach after this

74
00:23:00,0 --> 00:23:00,0
manner, false and vain

75
00:23:00,0 --> 00:23:00,0
and foolish doctrines,

76
00:23:00,0 --> 00:23:00,0
and shall be puffed

77
00:23:00,0 --> 00:23:00,0
up in their hearts,

78
00:23:00,0 --> 00:23:00,0
and shall seek deep to

79
00:23:00,0 --> 00:23:00,0
hide their counsels

80
00:23:00,0 --> 00:23:00,0
from the Lord; and

81
00:23:00,0 --> 00:24:30,
their works shall be in the dark.

82
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
10 And the blood

83
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
of the saints

84
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
shall cry from the

85
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:16,
ground against them.

86
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
11 Yea, they

87
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
have all gone

88
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
out of the way;

89
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
they have

90
00:24:16,0 --> 00:28:45,
become corrupted.

91
00:28:45,0 --> 00:28:45,0
12 Because of

92
00:28:45,0 --> 00:28:45,0
pride, and

93
00:28:45,0 --> 00:28:45,0
because of

94
00:28:45,0 --> 00:28:45,0
false teachers,

95
00:28:45,0 --> 00:28:45,0
and false

96
00:28:45,0 --> 00:28:45,0
doctrine, their

97
00:28:45,0 --> 00:28:45,0
churches have

98
00:28:45,0 --> 00:28:45,0
become

99
00:28:45,0 --> 00:28:45,0
corrupted, and

100
00:28:45,0 --> 00:28:45,0
their churches

101
00:28:45,0 --> 00:28:45,0
are lifted up;

102
00:28:45,0 --> 00:28:45,0
because of

103
00:28:45,0 --> 00:28:17,
pride they are puffed up.

104
00:28:17,0 --> 00:28:17,0
13 They rob

105
00:28:17,0 --> 00:28:17,0
the poor

106
00:28:17,0 --> 00:28:17,0
because of

107
00:28:17,0 --> 00:28:17,0
their fine

108
00:28:17,0 --> 00:28:17,0
sanctuaries; they

109
00:28:17,0 --> 00:28:17,0
rob the

110
00:28:17,0 --> 00:28:17,0
poor because of

111
00:28:17,0 --> 00:28:17,0
their fine

112
00:28:17,0 --> 00:28:17,0
clothing;

113
00:28:17,0 --> 00:28:17,0
and they

114
00:28:17,0 --> 00:28:17,0
persecute the

115
00:28:17,0 --> 00:28:17,0
meek and the

116
00:28:17,0 --> 00:28:17,0
poor in heart,

117
00:28:17,0 --> 00:28:17,0
because in

118
00:28:17,0 --> 00:28:17,0
their pride

119
00:28:17,0 --> 00:29:29,
they are puffed up.

120
00:29:29,0 --> 00:29:29,0
14 They

121
00:29:29,0 --> 00:29:29,0
wear stiff

122
00:29:29,0 --> 00:29:29,0
necks and high

123
00:29:29,0 --> 00:29:29,0
heads;

124
00:29:29,0 --> 00:29:29,0
yea, and

125
00:29:29,0 --> 00:29:29,0
because of

126
00:29:29,0 --> 00:29:29,0
pride, and

127
00:29:29,0 --> 00:29:29,0
wickedness, and

128
00:29:29,0 --> 00:29:29,0


129
00:29:29,0 --> 00:29:29,0
abominations, and

130
00:29:29,0 --> 00:29:29,0
whoredoms, they

131
00:29:29,0 --> 00:29:29,0
have all

132
00:29:29,0 --> 00:29:29,0
gone astray

133
00:29:29,0 --> 00:29:29,0
save it be

134
00:29:29,0 --> 00:29:29,0
a few, who

135
00:29:29,0 --> 00:29:29,0
are the

136
00:29:29,0 --> 00:29:29,0
humble

137
00:29:29,0 --> 00:29:29,0
followers of

138
00:29:29,0 --> 00:29:29,0
Christ;

139
00:29:29,0 --> 00:29:29,0
nevertheless, they

140
00:29:29,0 --> 00:29:29,0
are led,

141
00:29:29,0 --> 00:29:29,0
that in many

142
00:29:29,0 --> 00:29:29,0
instances

143
00:29:29,0 --> 00:29:29,0
they do err

144
00:29:29,0 --> 00:29:29,0
because

145
00:29:29,0 --> 00:29:01,
they are taught by the precepts of men.

146
00:29:01,0 --> 00:29:01,0
15 O the

147
00:29:01,0 --> 00:29:01,0
wise, and

148
00:29:01,0 --> 00:29:01,0
the

149
00:29:01,0 --> 00:29:01,0
learned, and the

150
00:29:01,0 --> 00:29:01,0
rich, that

151
00:29:01,0 --> 00:29:01,0
are

152
00:29:01,0 --> 00:29:01,0
puffed up in

153
00:29:01,0 --> 00:29:01,0
the pride of

154
00:29:01,0 --> 00:29:01,0
their

155
00:29:01,0 --> 00:29:01,0
hearts, and

156
00:29:01,0 --> 00:29:01,0
all those

157
00:29:01,0 --> 00:29:01,0
who preach

158
00:29:01,0 --> 00:29:01,0
false

159
00:29:01,0 --> 00:29:01,0
doctrines, and

160
00:29:01,0 --> 00:29:01,0
all those

161
00:29:01,0 --> 00:29:01,0
who

162
00:29:01,0 --> 00:29:01,0
commit

163
00:29:01,0 --> 00:29:01,0
whoredoms, and

164
00:29:01,0 --> 00:29:01,0
pervert the

165
00:29:01,0 --> 00:29:01,0
right way

166
00:29:01,0 --> 00:29:01,0
of the

167
00:29:01,0 --> 00:29:01,0
Lord, wo, wo,

168
00:29:01,0 --> 00:29:01,0
wo be unto

169
00:29:01,0 --> 00:29:01,0
them,

170
00:29:01,0 --> 00:29:01,0
saith the

171
00:29:01,0 --> 00:29:01,0
Lord God

172
00:29:01,0 --> 00:29:01,0
Almighty, for

173
00:29:01,0 --> 00:28:33,
they shall be thrust down to hell!

174
00:28:33,0 --> 00:28:33,0
16 Wo

175
00:28:33,0 --> 00:28:33,0
unto them

176
00:28:33,0 --> 00:28:33,0
that turn

177
00:28:33,0 --> 00:28:33,0
aside the

178
00:28:33,0 --> 00:28:33,0
just for

179
00:28:33,0 --> 00:28:33,0
a thing

180
00:28:33,0 --> 00:28:33,0
of naught

181
00:28:33,0 --> 00:28:33,0
and

182
00:28:33,0 --> 00:28:33,0
revile against

183
00:28:33,0 --> 00:28:33,0
that

184
00:28:33,0 --> 00:28:33,0
which is

185
00:28:33,0 --> 00:28:33,0
good, and

186
00:28:33,0 --> 00:28:33,0
say that it

187
00:28:33,0 --> 00:28:33,0
is of no

188
00:28:33,0 --> 00:28:33,0
worth!

189
00:28:33,0 --> 00:28:33,0
For the

190
00:28:33,0 --> 00:28:33,0
day shall

191
00:28:33,0 --> 00:28:33,0
come that

192
00:28:33,0 --> 00:28:33,0
the Lord

193
00:28:33,0 --> 00:28:33,0
God will

194
00:28:33,0 --> 00:28:33,0
speedily

195
00:28:33,0 --> 00:28:33,0
visit the

196
00:28:33,0 --> 00:28:33,0


197
00:28:33,0 --> 00:28:33,0
inhabitants of

198
00:28:33,0 --> 00:28:33,0
the earth;

199
00:28:33,0 --> 00:28:33,0
and in

200
00:28:33,0 --> 00:28:33,0
that day

201
00:28:33,0 --> 00:28:33,0
that they

202
00:28:33,0 --> 00:28:33,0
are fully

203
00:28:33,0 --> 00:29:31,
ripe in iniquity they shall perish.

204
00:29:31,0 --> 00:29:31,0
17 But

205
00:29:31,0 --> 00:29:31,0
behold,

206
00:29:31,0 --> 00:29:31,0
if the

207
00:29:31,0 --> 00:29:31,0


208
00:29:31,0 --> 00:29:31,0
inhabitants of the

209
00:29:31,0 --> 00:29:31,0
earth

210
00:29:31,0 --> 00:29:31,0
shall

211
00:29:31,0 --> 00:29:31,0
repent of

212
00:29:31,0 --> 00:29:31,0
their

213
00:29:31,0 --> 00:29:31,0
wickedness

214
00:29:31,0 --> 00:29:31,0
and

215
00:29:31,0 --> 00:29:31,0
abominations

216
00:29:31,0 --> 00:29:31,0
they

217
00:29:31,0 --> 00:29:31,0
shall not

218
00:29:31,0 --> 00:29:31,0
be

219
00:29:31,0 --> 00:29:31,0
destroyed,

220
00:29:31,0 --> 00:29:03,
saith the Lord of Hosts.

221
00:29:03,0 --> 00:29:03,0
18 But

222
00:29:03,0 --> 00:29:03,0
behold,

223
00:29:03,0 --> 00:29:03,0
