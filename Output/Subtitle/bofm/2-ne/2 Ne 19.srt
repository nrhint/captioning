00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,4
Chapter 19 Isaiah speaks messianically—The people

2
00:00:01,4 --> 00:00:02,8
 in darkness will see a great light—Unto us a child

3
00:00:02,8 --> 00:00:04,2
 is born—He will be the Prince of Peace and will

4
00:00:04,2 --> 00:00:05,6
 reign on David’s throne—Compare Isaiah 9. About

5
00:00:05,6 --> 00:00:07,0
 559–545 B.C.

6
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,308
1 Nevertheless, the dimness shall not be such as

7
00:00:09,308 --> 00:00:10,641
 was in her vexation, when at first he lightly

8
00:00:10,641 --> 00:00:11,974
 afflicted the land of Zebulun, and the land of

9
00:00:11,974 --> 00:00:13,307
 Naphtali, and afterwards did more grievously afflict by

10
00:00:13,307 --> 00:00:14,64
 the way of the Red Sea beyond Jordan in Galilee of

11
00:00:14,64 --> 00:00:15,973
 the nations

12
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,616
2 The people that walked in darkness have seen a

13
00:00:18,616 --> 00:00:21,283
 great light; they that dwell in the land of the

14
00:00:21,283 --> 00:00:23,95
 shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined

15
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,924
3 Thou hast multiplied the nation, and increased

16
00:00:25,924 --> 00:00:27,924
 the joy—they joy before thee according to the joy

17
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:29,924
 in harvest, and as men rejoice when they divide the

18
00:00:29,924 --> 00:00:31,924
 spoil

19
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:34,566
4 For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and

20
00:00:34,566 --> 00:00:37,233
 the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his

21
00:00:37,233 --> 00:00:39,9
 oppressor

22
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,54
5 For every battle of the warrior is with confused

23
00:00:42,54 --> 00:00:45,207
 noise, and garments rolled in blood; but this

24
00:00:45,207 --> 00:00:47,874
 shall be with burning and fuel of fire

25
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,448
6 For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is

26
00:00:49,448 --> 00:00:51,048
 given; and the government shall be upon his

27
00:00:51,048 --> 00:00:52,648
 shoulder; and his name shall be called, Wonderful,

28
00:00:52,648 --> 00:00:54,248
 Counselor, The Mighty God, The Everlasting Father, The

29
00:00:54,248 --> 00:00:55,848
 Prince of Peace

30
00:00:55,822 --> 00:01:15,022
7 Of the increase of government and peace there is

31
00:01:15,022 --> 00:01:34,222
 no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his

32
00:01:34,222 --> 00:01:53,422
 kingdom to order it, and to establish it with

33
00:01:53,422 --> 00:02:12,622
 judgment and with justice from henceforth, even forever.

34
00:02:12,622 --> 00:02:31,822
 The zeal of the Lord of Hosts will perform this

35
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:35,518
8 The Lord sent his word unto Jacob and it hath

36
00:02:35,518 --> 00:02:39,518
 lighted upon Israel

37
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:50,16
9 And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and

38
00:02:50,16 --> 00:03:00,827
 the inhabitants of Samaria, that say in the pride

39
00:03:00,827 --> 00:03:11,494
 and stoutness of heart

40
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:19,391
10 The bricks are fallen down, but we will build

41
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:27,391
 with hewn stones; the sycamores are cut down, but

42
00:03:27,391 --> 00:03:35,391
 we will change them into cedars

43
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:45,982
11 Therefore the Lord shall set up the adversaries

44
00:03:45,982 --> 00:03:56,649
 of Rezin against him, and join his enemies

45
00:03:56,649 --> 00:04:07,316
 together

46
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:09,214
12 The Syrians before and the Philistines behind;

47
00:04:09,214 --> 00:04:11,214
 and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For

48
00:04:11,214 --> 00:04:13,214
 all this his anger is not turned away, but his

49
00:04:13,214 --> 00:04:15,214
 hand is stretched out still

50
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:23,189
13 For the people turneth not unto him that

51
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:31,189
 smiteth them, neither do they seek the Lord of Hosts

52
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:54,638
14 Therefore will the Lord cut off from Israel

53
00:04:54,638 --> 00:05:18,138
 head and tail, branch and rush in one day

54
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:22,986
15 The ancient, he is the head; and the prophet

55
00:05:22,986 --> 00:05:26,986
 that teacheth lies, he is the tail

56
00:05:26,96 --> 00:05:38,96
16 For the leaders of this people cause them to

57
00:05:38,96 --> 00:05:50,96
 err; and they that are led of them are destroyed

58
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:53,551
17 Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their

59
00:05:53,551 --> 00:05:56,218
 young men, neither shall have mercy on their

60
00:05:56,218 --> 00:05:58,885
 fatherless and widows; for every one of them is a

61
00:05:58,885 --> 00:06:01,552
 hypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth speaketh

62
00:06:01,552 --> 00:06:04,219
 folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but

63
00:06:04,219 --> 00:06:06,886
 his hand is stretched out still

64
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:14,834
18 For wickedness burneth as the fire; it shall

65
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:22,834
 devour the briers and thorns, and shall kindle in

66
00:06:22,834 --> 00:06:30,834
 the thickets of the forests, and they shall mount up

67
00:06:30,834 --> 00:06:38,834
 like the lifting up of smoke

68
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:44,065
19 Through the wrath of the Lord of Hosts is the

69
00:06:44,065 --> 00:06:49,398
 land darkened, and the people shall be as the fuel

70
00:06:49,398 --> 00:06:54,731
 of the fire; no man shall spare his brother

71
00:06:54,681 --> 00:07:10,681
20 And he shall snatch on the right hand and be

72
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:26,681
 hungry; and he shall eat on the left hand and they

73
00:07:26,681 --> 00:07:42,681
 shall not be satisfied; they shall eat every man

74
00:07:42,681 --> 00:07:58,681
 the flesh of his own arm

75
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:58,478
21 Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh; they

76
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:58,478
 together shall be against Judah. For all this his

77
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:58,478
 anger is not turned away, but his hand is

78
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:58,478
 stretched out still.
