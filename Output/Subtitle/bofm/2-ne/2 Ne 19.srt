00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 19 Isaiah speaks messianically—The

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
people in darkness will see a great

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
light—Unto us a child is born—He will be the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Prince of Peace and will reign on David’s

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:04:57,
throne—Compare Isaiah 9. About 559–545 B.C. 

6
00:04:57,0 --> 00:04:57,0
1 Nevertheless, the dimness shall not

7
00:04:57,0 --> 00:04:57,0
be such as was in her vexation, when

8
00:04:57,0 --> 00:04:57,0
at first he lightly afflicted the

9
00:04:57,0 --> 00:04:57,0
land of Zebulun, and the land of

10
00:04:57,0 --> 00:04:57,0
Naphtali, and afterwards did more

11
00:04:57,0 --> 00:04:57,0
grievously afflict by the way of the Red Sea

12
00:04:57,0 --> 00:09:54,
beyond Jordan in Galilee of the nations.

13
00:09:54,0 --> 00:09:54,0
2 The people that walked in darkness

14
00:09:54,0 --> 00:09:54,0
have seen a great light; they that

15
00:09:54,0 --> 00:09:54,0
dwell in the land of the shadow of

16
00:09:54,0 --> 00:19:49,
death, upon them hath the light shined.

17
00:19:49,0 --> 00:19:49,0
3 Thou hast multiplied the

18
00:19:49,0 --> 00:19:49,0
nation, and increased the joy—they

19
00:19:49,0 --> 00:19:49,0
joy before thee according to

20
00:19:49,0 --> 00:19:49,0
the joy in harvest, and as men

21
00:19:49,0 --> 00:21:19,
rejoice when they divide the spoil.

22
00:21:19,0 --> 00:21:19,0
4 For thou hast broken

23
00:21:19,0 --> 00:21:19,0
the yoke of his burden, and

24
00:21:19,0 --> 00:21:19,0
the staff of his

25
00:21:19,0 --> 00:26:16,
shoulder, the rod of his oppressor.

26
00:26:16,0 --> 00:26:16,0
5 For every battle of

27
00:26:16,0 --> 00:26:16,0
the warrior is with

28
00:26:16,0 --> 00:26:16,0
confused noise, and

29
00:26:16,0 --> 00:26:16,0
garments rolled in blood;

30
00:26:16,0 --> 00:26:16,0
but this shall be with

31
00:26:16,0 --> 00:28:00,
burning and fuel of fire.

32
00:28:00,0 --> 00:28:00,0
6 For unto us a child

33
00:28:00,0 --> 00:28:00,0
is born, unto us a

34
00:28:00,0 --> 00:28:00,0
son is given; and the

35
00:28:00,0 --> 00:28:00,0
government shall be

36
00:28:00,0 --> 00:28:00,0
upon his shoulder; and

37
00:28:00,0 --> 00:28:00,0
his name shall be

38
00:28:00,0 --> 00:28:00,0
called, Wonderful,

39
00:28:00,0 --> 00:28:00,0
Counselor, The Mighty

40
00:28:00,0 --> 00:28:00,0
God, The Everlasting

41
00:28:00,0 --> 00:27:32,
Father, The Prince of Peace.

42
00:27:32,0 --> 00:27:32,0
7 Of the increase of

43
00:27:32,0 --> 00:27:32,0
government and

44
00:27:32,0 --> 00:27:32,0
peace there is no end,

45
00:27:32,0 --> 00:27:32,0
upon the throne of

46
00:27:32,0 --> 00:27:32,0
David, and upon his

47
00:27:32,0 --> 00:27:32,0
kingdom to order it,

48
00:27:32,0 --> 00:27:32,0
and to establish it

49
00:27:32,0 --> 00:27:32,0
with judgment and

50
00:27:32,0 --> 00:27:32,0
with justice from

51
00:27:32,0 --> 00:27:32,0
henceforth, even forever.

52
00:27:32,0 --> 00:27:32,0
The zeal of the

53
00:27:32,0 --> 00:27:04,
Lord of Hosts will perform this.

54
00:27:04,0 --> 00:27:04,0
8 The Lord sent

55
00:27:04,0 --> 00:27:04,0
his word unto

56
00:27:04,0 --> 00:27:04,0
Jacob and it hath

57
00:27:04,0 --> 00:26:36,
lighted upon Israel.

58
00:26:36,0 --> 00:26:36,0
9 And all the

59
00:26:36,0 --> 00:26:36,0
people shall

60
00:26:36,0 --> 00:26:36,0
know, even Ephraim

61
00:26:36,0 --> 00:26:36,0
and the

62
00:26:36,0 --> 00:26:36,0
inhabitants of

63
00:26:36,0 --> 00:26:36,0
Samaria, that say in

64
00:26:36,0 --> 00:26:36,0
the pride and

65
00:26:36,0 --> 00:26:50,
stoutness of heart:

66
00:26:50,0 --> 00:26:50,0
10 The bricks

67
00:26:50,0 --> 00:26:50,0
are fallen

68
00:26:50,0 --> 00:26:50,0
down, but we will

69
00:26:50,0 --> 00:26:50,0
build with

70
00:26:50,0 --> 00:26:50,0
hewn stones; the

71
00:26:50,0 --> 00:26:50,0
sycamores are

72
00:26:50,0 --> 00:26:50,0
cut down, but

73
00:26:50,0 --> 00:26:50,0
we will

74
00:26:50,0 --> 00:27:48,
change them into cedars.

75
00:27:48,0 --> 00:27:48,0
11 Therefore

76
00:27:48,0 --> 00:27:48,0
the Lord

77
00:27:48,0 --> 00:27:48,0
shall set up

78
00:27:48,0 --> 00:27:48,0
the

79
00:27:48,0 --> 00:27:48,0
adversaries of Rezin

80
00:27:48,0 --> 00:27:48,0
against him,

81
00:27:48,0 --> 00:27:48,0
and join

82
00:27:48,0 --> 00:27:20,
his enemies together;

83
00:27:20,0 --> 00:27:20,0
12 The

84
00:27:20,0 --> 00:27:20,0
Syrians before

85
00:27:20,0 --> 00:27:20,0
and the

86
00:27:20,0 --> 00:27:20,0
Philistines

87
00:27:20,0 --> 00:27:20,0
behind; and

88
00:27:20,0 --> 00:27:20,0
they shall

89
00:27:20,0 --> 00:27:20,0
devour

90
00:27:20,0 --> 00:27:20,0
Israel with open

91
00:27:20,0 --> 00:27:20,0
mouth. For

92
00:27:20,0 --> 00:27:20,0
all this

93
00:27:20,0 --> 00:27:20,0
his anger is

94
00:27:20,0 --> 00:27:20,0
not turned

95
00:27:20,0 --> 00:27:20,0
away, but

96
00:27:20,0 --> 00:27:20,0
his hand is

97
00:27:20,0 --> 00:26:52,
stretched out still.

98
00:26:52,0 --> 00:26:52,0
13 For the

99
00:26:52,0 --> 00:26:52,0
people

100
00:26:52,0 --> 00:26:52,0
turneth not

101
00:26:52,0 --> 00:26:52,0
unto him

102
00:26:52,0 --> 00:26:52,0
that

103
00:26:52,0 --> 00:26:52,0
smiteth them,

104
00:26:52,0 --> 00:26:52,0
neither do

105
00:26:52,0 --> 00:26:52,0
they seek

106
00:26:52,0 --> 00:26:38,
the Lord of Hosts.

107
00:26:38,0 --> 00:26:38,0
14

108
00:26:38,0 --> 00:26:38,0
Therefore will

109
00:26:38,0 --> 00:26:38,0
the Lord

110
00:26:38,0 --> 00:26:38,0
cut off

111
00:26:38,0 --> 00:26:38,0
from

112
00:26:38,0 --> 00:26:38,0
Israel head

113
00:26:38,0 --> 00:26:38,0
and tail,

114
00:26:38,0 --> 00:26:38,0
branch and

115
00:26:38,0 --> 00:26:24,
rush in one day.

116
00:26:24,0 --> 00:26:24,0
15 The

117
00:26:24,0 --> 00:26:24,0
ancient,

118
00:26:24,0 --> 00:26:24,0
he is

119
00:26:24,0 --> 00:26:24,0
the head;

120
00:26:24,0 --> 00:26:24,0
and the

121
00:26:24,0 --> 00:26:24,0
prophet

122
00:26:24,0 --> 00:26:24,0
that

123
00:26:24,0 --> 00:26:24,0
teacheth

124
00:26:24,0 --> 00:26:24,0
lies, he

125
00:26:24,0 --> 00:25:56,
is the tail.

126
00:25:56,0 --> 00:25:56,0
16 For

127
00:25:56,0 --> 00:25:56,0
the

128
00:25:56,0 --> 00:25:56,0
leaders of

129
00:25:56,0 --> 00:25:56,0
this

130
00:25:56,0 --> 00:25:56,0
people

131
00:25:56,0 --> 00:25:56,0
cause

132
00:25:56,0 --> 00:25:56,0
them to

133
00:25:56,0 --> 00:25:56,0
err; and

134
00:25:56,0 --> 00:25:56,0
they

135
00:25:56,0 --> 00:25:56,0
that are

136
00:25:56,0 --> 00:25:56,0
led of

137
00:25:56,0 --> 00:25:56,0
them

138
00:25:56,0 --> 00:25:42,
are destroyed.

139
00:25:42,0 --> 00:25:42,0
17

140
00:25:42,0 --> 00:25:42,0
Therefore

141
00:25:42,0 --> 00:25:42,0
the

142
00:25:42,0 --> 00:25:42,0
Lord

143
00:25:42,0 --> 00:25:42,0
shall

144
00:25:42,0 --> 00:25:42,0
have no

145
00:25:42,0 --> 00:25:42,0
joy in

146
00:25:42,0 --> 00:25:42,0
their

147
00:25:42,0 --> 00:25:42,0
young

148
00:25:42,0 --> 00:25:42,0
men,

149
00:25:42,0 --> 00:25:42,0


150
00:25:42,0 --> 00:25:42,0
neither

151
00:25:42,0 --> 00:25:42,0
shall have

152
00:25:42,0 --> 00:25:42,0
mercy

153
00:25:42,0 --> 00:25:42,0
on

154
00:25:42,0 --> 00:25:42,0
their

155
00:25:42,0 --> 00:25:42,0


156
00:25:42,0 --> 00:25:42,0
fatherless and

157
00:25:42,0 --> 00:25:42,0


158
00:25:42,0 --> 00:25:42,0
widows; for

159
00:25:42,0 --> 00:25:42,0
every

160
00:25:42,0 --> 00:25:42,0
one

161
00:25:42,0 --> 00:25:42,0
of them

162
00:25:42,0 --> 00:25:42,0
is a

163
00:25:42,0 --> 00:25:42,0


164
00:25:42,0 --> 00:25:42,0
hypocrite

165
00:25:42,0 --> 00:25:42,0
and an

166
00:25:42,0 --> 00:25:42,0


167
00:25:42,0 --> 00:25:42,0
evildoer, and

168
00:25:42,0 --> 00:25:42,0
every

169
00:25:42,0 --> 00:25:42,0
mouth

170
00:25:42,0 --> 00:25:42,0


171
00:25:42,0 --> 00:25:42,0
speaketh

172
00:25:42,0 --> 00:25:42,0
folly.

173
00:25:42,0 --> 00:25:42,0
For all

174
00:25:42,0 --> 00:25:42,0
this

175
00:25:42,0 --> 00:25:42,0
his

176
00:25:42,0 --> 00:25:42,0
anger is

177
00:25:42,0 --> 00:25:42,0
not

178
00:25:42,0 --> 00:25:42,0
turned

179
00:25:42,0 --> 00:27:26,
away, but his hand is stretched out still.

180
00:27:26,0 --> 00:27:26,0
18 For

181
00:27:26,0 --> 00:27:26,0


182
00:27:26,0 --> 00:27:26,0
wickedness

183
00:27:26,0 --> 00:27:26,0


184
00:27:26,0 --> 00:27:26,0
burneth as

185
00:27:26,0 --> 00:27:26,0
the

186
00:27:26,0 --> 00:27:26,0
fire; it

187
00:27:26,0 --> 00:27:26,0
shall

188
00:27:26,0 --> 00:27:26,0
devour

189
00:27:26,0 --> 00:27:26,0
the

190
00:27:26,0 --> 00:27:26,0
briers

191
00:27:26,0 --> 00:27:26,0
and

192
00:27:26,0 --> 00:27:26,0
thorns,

193
00:27:26,0 --> 00:27:26,0
and

194
00:27:26,0 --> 00:27:26,0
shall

195
00:27:26,0 --> 00:27:26,0
kindle

196
00:27:26,0 --> 00:27:26,0
in the

197
00:27:26,0 --> 00:27:26,0


198
00:27:26,0 --> 00:27:26,0
thickets of

199
00:27:26,0 --> 00:27:26,0
the

200
00:27:26,0 --> 00:27:26,0
forests,

201
00:27:26,0 --> 00:27:26,0
and

202
00:27:26,0 --> 00:27:26,0
they

203
00:27:26,0 --> 00:27:26,0
shall

204
00:27:26,0 --> 00:27:26,0
mount up

205
00:27:26,0 --> 00:27:26,0
like

206
00:27:26,0 --> 00:27:26,0
the

207
00:27:26,0 --> 00:27:26,0
lifting

208
00:27:26,0 --> 00:27:26,0
up of

209
00:27:26,0 --> 00:26:58,
smoke.

210
00:26:58,0 --> 00:26:58,0
19

211
00:26:58,0 --> 00:26:58,0
Through

212
00:26:58,0 --> 00:26:58,0
the

213
00:26:58,0 --> 00:26:58,0
wrath of

214
00:26:58,0 --> 00:26:58,0
the

215
00:26:58,0 --> 00:26:58,0
Lord of

216
00:26:58,0 --> 00:26:58,0
Hosts

217
00:26:58,0 --> 00:26:58,0
is the

218
00:26:58,0 --> 00:26:58,0
land

219
00:26:58,0 --> 00:26:58,0


220
00:26:58,0 --> 00:26:58,0
darkened,

221
00:26:58,0 --> 00:26:58,0
and the

222
00:26:58,0 --> 00:26:58,0
people

223
00:26:58,0 --> 00:26:58,0
shall

224
00:26:58,0 --> 00:26:58,0
be as

225
00:26:58,0 --> 00:26:58,0
the

226
00:26:58,0 --> 00:26:58,0
fuel of

227
00:26:58,0 --> 00:26:58,0
the

228
00:26:58,0 --> 00:26:58,0
fire;

229
00:26:58,0 --> 00:26:58,0
no man

230
00:26:58,0 --> 00:26:58,0
