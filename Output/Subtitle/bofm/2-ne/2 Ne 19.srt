1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:02,8
Chapter 19 Isaiah speaks messianically—The

2
00:00:02,8 --> 00:00:05,6
people in darkness will see a great

3
00:00:05,6 --> 00:00:08,4
light—Unto us a child is born—He will be the

4
00:00:08,4 --> 00:00:11,2
Prince of Peace and will reign on David’s

5
00:00:11,2 --> 00:00:14,982
throne—Compare Isaiah 9. About 559–545 B.C. 

6
00:00:14,982 --> 00:00:15,696
1 Nevertheless, the dimness shall not

7
00:00:15,696 --> 00:00:16,41
be such as was in her vexation, when

8
00:00:16,41 --> 00:00:17,124
at first he lightly afflicted the

9
00:00:17,124 --> 00:00:17,838
land of Zebulun, and the land of

10
00:00:17,838 --> 00:00:18,552
Naphtali, and afterwards did more

11
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:19,266
grievously afflict by the way of the Red Sea

12
00:00:19,266 --> 00:00:19,92
beyond Jordan in Galilee of the nations.

13
00:00:19,92 --> 00:00:25,67
2 The people that walked in darkness

14
00:00:25,67 --> 00:00:31,42
have seen a great light; they that

15
00:00:31,42 --> 00:00:37,17
dwell in the land of the shadow of

16
00:00:37,17 --> 00:00:42,876
death, upon them hath the light shined.

17
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,476
3 Thou hast multiplied the

18
00:00:44,476 --> 00:00:46,076
nation, and increased the joy—they

19
00:00:46,076 --> 00:00:47,676
joy before thee according to

20
00:00:47,676 --> 00:00:49,276
the joy in harvest, and as men

21
00:00:49,276 --> 00:00:50,851
rejoice when they divide the spoil.

22
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:51,851
4 For thou hast broken

23
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:52,851
the yoke of his burden, and

24
00:00:52,851 --> 00:00:53,851
the staff of his

25
00:00:53,851 --> 00:00:54,321
shoulder, the rod of his oppressor.

26
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:54,154
5 For every battle of

27
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:53,987
the warrior is with

28
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:53,82
confused noise, and

29
00:00:53,82 --> 00:00:53,653
garments rolled in blood;

30
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:53,486
but this shall be with

31
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:53,387
burning and fuel of fire.

32
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:53,287
6 For unto us a child

33
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:53,187
is born, unto us a

34
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:53,087
son is given; and the

35
00:00:53,087 --> 00:00:52,987
government shall be

36
00:00:52,987 --> 00:00:52,887
upon his shoulder; and

37
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:52,787
his name shall be

38
00:00:52,787 --> 00:00:52,687
called, Wonderful,

39
00:00:52,687 --> 00:00:52,587
Counselor, The Mighty

40
00:00:52,587 --> 00:00:52,487
God, The Everlasting

41
00:00:52,487 --> 00:00:52,92
Father, The Prince of Peace.

42
00:00:52,92 --> 00:00:52,92
7 Of the increase of

43
00:00:52,92 --> 00:00:52,92
government and

44
00:00:52,92 --> 00:00:52,92
peace there is no end,

45
00:00:52,92 --> 00:00:52,92
upon the throne of

46
00:00:52,92 --> 00:00:52,92
David, and upon his

47
00:00:52,92 --> 00:00:52,92
kingdom to order it,

48
00:00:52,92 --> 00:00:52,92
and to establish it

49
00:00:52,92 --> 00:00:52,92
with judgment and

50
00:00:52,92 --> 00:00:52,92
with justice from

51
00:00:52,92 --> 00:00:52,92
henceforth, even forever.

52
00:00:52,92 --> 00:00:52,92
The zeal of the

53
00:00:52,92 --> 00:00:52,452
Lord of Hosts will perform this.

54
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:52,202
8 The Lord sent

55
00:00:52,202 --> 00:00:51,952
his word unto

56
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:51,702
Jacob and it hath

57
00:00:51,702 --> 00:00:51,985
lighted upon Israel.

58
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:52,485
9 And all the

59
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:52,985
people shall

60
00:00:52,985 --> 00:00:53,485
know, even Ephraim

61
00:00:53,485 --> 00:00:53,985
and the

62
00:00:53,985 --> 00:00:54,485
inhabitants of

63
00:00:54,485 --> 00:00:54,985
Samaria, that say in

64
00:00:54,985 --> 00:00:55,485
the pride and

65
00:00:55,485 --> 00:00:55,455
stoutness of heart:

66
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:55,344
10 The bricks

67
00:00:55,344 --> 00:00:55,233
are fallen

68
00:00:55,233 --> 00:00:55,122
down, but we will

69
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:55,011
build with

70
00:00:55,011 --> 00:00:54,9
hewn stones; the

71
00:00:54,9 --> 00:00:54,789
sycamores are

72
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:54,678
cut down, but

73
00:00:54,678 --> 00:00:54,567
we will

74
00:00:54,567 --> 00:00:54,521
change them into cedars.

75
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:54,396
11 Therefore

76
00:00:54,396 --> 00:00:54,271
the Lord

77
00:00:54,271 --> 00:00:54,146
shall set up

78
00:00:54,146 --> 00:00:54,021
the

79
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:53,896
adversaries of Rezin

80
00:00:53,896 --> 00:00:53,771
against him,

81
00:00:53,771 --> 00:00:53,646
and join

82
00:00:53,646 --> 00:00:53,587
his enemies together;

83
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:53,654
12 The

84
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:53,721
Syrians before

85
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:53,788
and the

86
00:00:53,788 --> 00:00:53,855
Philistines

87
00:00:53,855 --> 00:00:53,922
behind; and

88
00:00:53,922 --> 00:00:53,989
they shall

89
00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:54,056
devour

90
00:00:54,056 --> 00:00:54,123
Israel with open

91
00:00:54,123 --> 00:00:54,19
mouth. For

92
00:00:54,19 --> 00:00:54,257
all this

93
00:00:54,257 --> 00:00:54,324
his anger is

94
00:00:54,324 --> 00:00:54,391
not turned

95
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:54,458
away, but

96
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:54,525
his hand is

97
00:00:54,525 --> 00:00:54,588
stretched out still.

98
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:54,477
13 For the

99
00:00:54,477 --> 00:00:54,366
people

100
00:00:54,366 --> 00:00:54,255
turneth not

101
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:54,144
unto him

102
00:00:54,144 --> 00:00:54,033
that

103
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:53,922
smiteth them,

104
00:00:53,922 --> 00:00:53,811
neither do

105
00:00:53,811 --> 00:00:53,7
they seek

106
00:00:53,7 --> 00:00:53,654
the Lord of Hosts.

107
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:53,876
14

108
00:00:53,876 --> 00:00:54,098
Therefore will

109
00:00:54,098 --> 00:00:54,32
the Lord

110
00:00:54,32 --> 00:00:54,542
cut off

111
00:00:54,542 --> 00:00:54,764
from

112
00:00:54,764 --> 00:00:54,986
Israel head

113
00:00:54,986 --> 00:00:55,208
and tail,

114
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:55,43
branch and

115
00:00:55,43 --> 00:00:55,589
rush in one day.

116
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:55,489
15 The

117
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:55,389
ancient,

118
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:55,289
he is

119
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:55,189
the head;

120
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:55,089
and the

121
00:00:55,089 --> 00:00:54,989
prophet

122
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:54,889
that

123
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:54,789
teacheth

124
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:54,689
lies, he

125
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:54,655
is the tail.

126
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:54,578
16 For

127
00:00:54,578 --> 00:00:54,501
the

128
00:00:54,501 --> 00:00:54,424
leaders of

129
00:00:54,424 --> 00:00:54,347
this

130
00:00:54,347 --> 00:00:54,27
people

131
00:00:54,27 --> 00:00:54,193
cause

132
00:00:54,193 --> 00:00:54,116
them to

133
00:00:54,116 --> 00:00:54,039
err; and

134
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:53,962
they

135
00:00:53,962 --> 00:00:53,885
that are

136
00:00:53,885 --> 00:00:53,808
led of

137
00:00:53,808 --> 00:00:53,731
them

138
00:00:53,731 --> 00:00:53,72
are destroyed.

139
00:00:53,72 --> 00:00:53,696
17

140
00:00:53,696 --> 00:00:53,672
Therefore

141
00:00:53,672 --> 00:00:53,648
the

142
00:00:53,648 --> 00:00:53,624
Lord

143
00:00:53,624 --> 00:00:53,6
shall

144
00:00:53,6 --> 00:00:53,576
have no

145
00:00:53,576 --> 00:00:53,552
joy in

146
00:00:53,552 --> 00:00:53,528
their

147
00:00:53,528 --> 00:00:53,504
young

148
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:53,48
men,

149
00:00:53,48 --> 00:00:53,456


150
00:00:53,456 --> 00:00:53,432
neither

151
00:00:53,432 --> 00:00:53,408
shall have

152
00:00:53,408 --> 00:00:53,384
mercy

153
00:00:53,384 --> 00:00:53,36
on

154
00:00:53,36 --> 00:00:53,336
their

155
00:00:53,336 --> 00:00:53,312


156
00:00:53,312 --> 00:00:53,288
fatherless and

157
00:00:53,288 --> 00:00:53,264


158
00:00:53,264 --> 00:00:53,24
widows; for

159
00:00:53,24 --> 00:00:53,216
every

160
00:00:53,216 --> 00:00:53,192
one

161
00:00:53,192 --> 00:00:53,168
of them

162
00:00:53,168 --> 00:00:53,144
is a

163
00:00:53,144 --> 00:00:53,12


164
00:00:53,12 --> 00:00:53,096
hypocrite

165
00:00:53,096 --> 00:00:53,072
and an

166
00:00:53,072 --> 00:00:53,048


167
00:00:53,048 --> 00:00:53,024
evildoer, and

168
00:00:53,024 --> 00:00:53,0
every

169
00:00:53,0 --> 00:00:52,976

170
00:00:52,976 --> 00:00:52,952


171
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:52,928
speaketh

172
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:52,904
folly.

173
00:00:52,904 --> 00:00:52,88
For all

174
00:00:52,88 --> 00:00:52,856
this

175
00:00:52,856 --> 00:00:52,832
his

176
00:00:52,832 --> 00:00:52,808
anger is

177
00:00:52,808 --> 00:00:52,784
not

178
00:00:52,784 --> 00:00:52,76
turned

179
00:00:52,76 --> 00:00:52,786
away, but his hand is stretched out still.

180
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:52,753
18 For

181
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:52,72


182
00:00:52,72 --> 00:00:52,687
wickedness

183
00:00:52,687 --> 00:00:52,654


184
00:00:52,654 --> 00:00:52,621
burneth as

185
00:00:52,621 --> 00:00:52,588
the

186
00:00:52,588 --> 00:00:52,555
fire; it

187
00:00:52,555 --> 00:00:52,522
shall

188
00:00:52,522 --> 00:00:52,489
devour

189
00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:52,456
the

190
00:00:52,456 --> 00:00:52,423
briers

191
00:00:52,423 --> 00:00:52,39
and

192
00:00:52,39 --> 00:00:52,357
thorns,

193
00:00:52,357 --> 00:00:52,324
and

194
00:00:52,324 --> 00:00:52,291

195
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:52,258
kindle

196
00:00:52,258 --> 00:00:52,225

198
00:00:52,192 --> 00:00:52,159
thickets of

199
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:52,126
the

200
00:00:52,126 --> 00:00:52,093
forests,

201
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:52,06
and

202
00:00:52,06 --> 00:00:52,027
they

203
00:00:52,027 --> 00:00:51,994

00:00:51,994 --> 00:00:51,961
mount up

205
00:00:51,961 --> 00:00:51,928
like

206
00:00:51,928 --> 00:00:51,895
the
