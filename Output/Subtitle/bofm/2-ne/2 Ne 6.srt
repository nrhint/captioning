00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:02,5
Chapter 6 Jacob recounts Jewish history:

2
00:00:02,5 --> 00:00:05,0
The Babylonian captivity and return; the

3
00:00:05,0 --> 00:00:07,5
ministry and crucifixion of the Holy One of

4
00:00:07,5 --> 00:00:10,0
Israel; the help received from the Gentiles;

5
00:00:10,0 --> 00:00:12,5
and the Jews’ latter-day restoration when

6
00:00:12,5 --> 00:00:15,916
they believe in the Messiah. About 559–545 B.C. 

7
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:20,916
1 The words of Jacob, the brother of

8
00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:25,826
Nephi, which he spake unto the people of Nephi:

9
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:26,951
2 Behold, my beloved brethren, I,

10
00:00:26,951 --> 00:00:28,076
Jacob, having been called of God, and

11
00:00:28,076 --> 00:00:29,201
ordained after the manner of his holy

12
00:00:29,201 --> 00:00:30,326
order, and having been consecrated by my

13
00:00:30,326 --> 00:00:31,451
brother Nephi, unto whom ye look as a

14
00:00:31,451 --> 00:00:32,576
king or a protector, and on whom ye

15
00:00:32,576 --> 00:00:33,701
depend for safety, behold ye know that I

16
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:34,768
have spoken unto you exceedingly many things.

17
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:34,868
3 Nevertheless, I speak unto you

18
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:34,968
again; for I am desirous for the

19
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:35,068
welfare of your souls. Yea, mine anxiety

20
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:35,168
is great for you; and ye yourselves

21
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:35,268
know that it ever has been. For I

22
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:35,368
have exhorted you with all diligence;

23
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:35,468
and I have taught you the words of my

24
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:35,568
father; and I have spoken unto you

25
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:35,668
concerning all things which are

26
00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:35,769
written, from the creation of the world.

27
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:36,102
4 And now, behold, I would speak

28
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:36,435
unto you concerning things which

29
00:00:36,435 --> 00:00:36,768
are, and which are to come;

30
00:00:36,768 --> 00:00:37,101
wherefore, I will read you the words of

31
00:00:37,101 --> 00:00:37,434
Isaiah. And they are the words which

32
00:00:37,434 --> 00:00:37,767
my brother has desired that I

33
00:00:37,767 --> 00:00:38,1
should speak unto you. And I speak

34
00:00:38,1 --> 00:00:38,433
unto you for your sakes, that ye may

35
00:00:38,433 --> 00:00:38,772
learn and glorify the name of your God.

36
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:39,772
5 And now, the words which I

37
00:00:39,772 --> 00:00:40,772
shall read are they which

38
00:00:40,772 --> 00:00:41,772
Isaiah spake concerning all the

39
00:00:41,772 --> 00:00:42,772
house of Israel; wherefore, they

40
00:00:42,772 --> 00:00:43,772
may be likened unto you, for

41
00:00:43,772 --> 00:00:44,772
ye are of the house of Israel.

42
00:00:44,772 --> 00:00:45,772
And there are many things

43
00:00:45,772 --> 00:00:46,772
which have been spoken by Isaiah

44
00:00:46,772 --> 00:00:47,772
which may be likened unto you,

45
00:00:47,772 --> 00:00:48,181
because ye are of the house of Israel.

46
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:49,181
6 And now, these are the

47
00:00:49,181 --> 00:00:50,181
words: Thus saith the Lord

48
00:00:50,181 --> 00:00:51,181
God: Behold, I will lift up

49
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:52,181
mine hand to the Gentiles,

50
00:00:52,181 --> 00:00:53,181
and set up my standard to

51
00:00:53,181 --> 00:00:54,181
the people; and they shall

52
00:00:54,181 --> 00:00:55,181
bring thy sons in their arms,

53
00:00:55,181 --> 00:00:56,181
and thy daughters shall be

54
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,157
carried upon their shoulders.

55
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,957
7 And kings shall be thy

56
00:00:57,957 --> 00:00:58,757
nursing fathers, and their

57
00:00:58,757 --> 00:00:59,557
queens thy nursing

58
00:00:59,557 --> 00:01:00,357
mothers; they shall bow down to

59
00:01:00,357 --> 00:01:01,157
thee with their faces

60
00:01:01,157 --> 00:01:01,957
towards the earth, and lick up

61
00:01:01,957 --> 00:01:02,757
the dust of thy feet; and

62
00:01:02,757 --> 00:01:03,557
thou shalt know that I am

63
00:01:03,557 --> 00:01:04,357
the Lord; for they shall

64
00:01:04,357 --> 00:01:05,132
not be ashamed that wait for me.

65
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:05,382
8 And now I, Jacob,

66
00:01:05,382 --> 00:01:05,632
would speak somewhat

67
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:05,882
concerning these words. For

68
00:01:05,882 --> 00:01:06,132
behold, the Lord has shown

69
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:06,382
me that those who were

70
00:01:06,382 --> 00:01:06,632
at Jerusalem, from whence

71
00:01:06,632 --> 00:01:06,882
we came, have been

72
00:01:06,882 --> 00:01:07,534
slain and carried away captive.

73
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:07,463
9 Nevertheless, the

74
00:01:07,463 --> 00:01:07,392
Lord has shown unto me

75
00:01:07,392 --> 00:01:07,321
that they should return

76
00:01:07,321 --> 00:01:07,25
again. And he also has

77
00:01:07,25 --> 00:01:07,179
shown unto me that the

78
00:01:07,179 --> 00:01:07,108
Lord God, the Holy One of

79
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:07,037
Israel, should

80
00:01:07,037 --> 00:01:06,966
manifest himself unto them in

81
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:06,895
the flesh; and after he

82
00:01:06,895 --> 00:01:06,824
should manifest

83
00:01:06,824 --> 00:01:06,753
himself they should scourge

84
00:01:06,753 --> 00:01:06,682
him and crucify him,

85
00:01:06,682 --> 00:01:06,611
according to the words of

86
00:01:06,611 --> 00:01:06,6
the angel who spake it unto me.

87
00:01:06,6 --> 00:01:07,509
10 And after they

88
00:01:07,509 --> 00:01:08,418
have hardened their

89
00:01:08,418 --> 00:01:09,327
hearts and stiffened

90
00:01:09,327 --> 00:01:10,236
their necks against the

91
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,145
Holy One of Israel,

92
00:01:11,145 --> 00:01:12,054
behold, the judgments

93
00:01:12,054 --> 00:01:12,963
of the Holy One of

94
00:01:12,963 --> 00:01:13,872
Israel shall come upon

95
00:01:13,872 --> 00:01:14,781
them. And the day

96
00:01:14,781 --> 00:01:15,69
cometh that they shall be

97
00:01:15,69 --> 00:01:16,476
smitten and afflicted.

98
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:16,476
11 Wherefore, after

99
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:16,476
they are driven to

100
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:16,476
and fro, for thus

101
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:16,476
saith the angel, many

102
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:16,476
shall be afflicted in

103
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:16,476
the flesh, and

104
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:16,476
shall not be suffered to

105
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:16,476
perish, because of

106
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:16,476
the prayers of the

107
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:16,476
faithful; they shall

108
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:16,476
be scattered, and

109
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:16,476
smitten, and hated;

110
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:16,476
nevertheless, the Lord

111
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:16,476
will be merciful

112
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:16,476
unto them, that when

113
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:16,476
they shall come to

114
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:16,476
the knowledge of their

115
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:16,476
Redeemer, they

116
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:16,476
shall be gathered

117
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:16,476
together again to the

118
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:16,009
lands of their inheritance.

119
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:16,062
12 And blessed are

120
00:01:16,062 --> 00:01:16,115
the Gentiles, they

121
00:01:16,115 --> 00:01:16,168
of whom the prophet

122
00:01:16,168 --> 00:01:16,221
has written; for

123
00:01:16,221 --> 00:01:16,274
behold, if it so be

124
00:01:16,274 --> 00:01:16,327
that they shall

125
00:01:16,327 --> 00:01:16,38
repent and fight not

126
00:01:16,38 --> 00:01:16,433
against Zion, and do

127
00:01:16,433 --> 00:01:16,486
not unite

128
00:01:16,486 --> 00:01:16,539
themselves to that great

129
00:01:16,539 --> 00:01:16,592
and abominable

130
00:01:16,592 --> 00:01:16,645
church, they shall be

131
00:01:16,645 --> 00:01:16,698
saved; for the Lord

132
00:01:16,698 --> 00:01:16,751
God will fulfil his

133
00:01:16,751 --> 00:01:16,804
covenants which he

134
00:01:16,804 --> 00:01:16,857
has made unto his

135
00:01:16,857 --> 00:01:16,91
children; and for

136
00:01:16,91 --> 00:01:16,963
this cause the prophet

137
00:01:16,963 --> 00:01:17,477
has written these things.

138
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:17,41
13 Wherefore, they

139
00:01:17,41 --> 00:01:17,343
that fight

140
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:17,276
against Zion and the

141
00:01:17,276 --> 00:01:17,209
covenant people of

142
00:01:17,209 --> 00:01:17,142
the Lord shall lick

143
00:01:17,142 --> 00:01:17,075
up the dust of

144
00:01:17,075 --> 00:01:17,008
their feet; and the

145
00:01:17,008 --> 00:01:16,941
people of the Lord

146
00:01:16,941 --> 00:01:16,874
shall not be

147
00:01:16,874 --> 00:01:16,807
ashamed. For the people

148
00:01:16,807 --> 00:01:16,74
of the Lord are

149
00:01:16,74 --> 00:01:16,673
they who wait for

150
00:01:16,673 --> 00:01:16,606
him; for they still

151
00:01:16,606 --> 00:01:16,539
wait for the

152
00:01:16,539 --> 00:01:16,543
coming of the Messiah.

153
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:16,754
14 And behold,

154
00:01:16,754 --> 00:01:16,965
according to the

155
00:01:16,965 --> 00:01:17,176
words of the

156
00:01:17,176 --> 00:01:17,387
prophet, the Messiah

157
00:01:17,387 --> 00:01:17,598
will set himself

158
00:01:17,598 --> 00:01:17,809
again the second

159
00:01:17,809 --> 00:01:18,02
time to recover

160
00:01:18,02 --> 00:01:18,231
them; wherefore, he

161
00:01:18,231 --> 00:01:18,442
will manifest

162
00:01:18,442 --> 00:01:18,653
himself unto them in

163
00:01:18,653 --> 00:01:18,864
power and great

164
00:01:18,864 --> 00:01:19,075
glory, unto the

165
00:01:19,075 --> 00:01:19,286
destruction of

166
00:01:19,286 --> 00:01:19,497
their enemies, when

167
00:01:19,497 --> 00:01:19,708
that day cometh

168
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:19,919
when they shall

169
00:01:19,919 --> 00:01:20,13
believe in him; and

170
00:01:20,13 --> 00:01:20,341
none will he

171
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:20,013
destroy that believe in him.

172
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:21,227
15 And they that

173
00:01:21,227 --> 00:01:22,441
believe not in

174
00:01:22,441 --> 00:01:23,655
him shall be

175
00:01:23,655 --> 00:01:24,869
destroyed, both by

176
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:26,083
fire, and by

177
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:27,297
tempest, and by

178
00:01:27,297 --> 00:01:28,511
earthquakes, and by

179
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:29,725
bloodsheds, and

180
00:01:29,725 --> 00:01:30,939
by pestilence,

181
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:32,153
and by famine.

182
00:01:32,153 --> 00:01:33,367
And they shall

183
00:01:33,367 --> 00:01:34,581
know that the Lord

184
00:01:34,581 --> 00:01:35,795
is God, the

185
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:37,864
Holy One of Israel.

186
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:39,864
16 For shall the

187
00:01:39,864 --> 00:01:41,864
prey be taken

188
00:01:41,864 --> 00:01:43,864
from the mighty,

189
00:01:43,864 --> 00:01:45,864
or the lawful

190
00:01:45,864 --> 00:01:47,774
captive delivered?

191
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:47,715
17 But thus

192
00:01:47,715 --> 00:01:47,656
saith the Lord:

193
00:01:47,656 --> 00:01:47,597
Even the captives

194
00:01:47,597 --> 00:01:47,538
of the mighty

195
00:01:47,538 --> 00:01:47,479
shall be taken

196
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:47,42
away, and the

197
00:01:47,42 --> 00:01:47,361
prey of the

198
00:01:47,361 --> 00:01:47,302
terrible shall be

199
00:01:47,302 --> 00:01:47,243
delivered; for

200
00:01:47,243 --> 00:01:47,184
the Mighty God

201
00:01:47,184 --> 00:01:47,125
shall deliver

202
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:47,066
his covenant

203
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:47,007
people. For thus

204
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:46,948
saith the Lord: I

205
00:01:46,948 --> 00:01:46,889
will contend

206
00:01:46,889 --> 00:01:46,83
with them that

207
00:01:46,83 --> 00:01:46,84
contendeth with thee—

208
00:01:46,84 --> 00:01:47,528
18 And I will

209
00:01:47,528 --> 00:01:48,216
feed them that

210
00:01:48,216 --> 00:01:48,904
oppress thee,

211
00:01:48,904 --> 00:01:49,592
with their

212
00:01:49,592 --> 00:01:50,28
own flesh; and

213
00:01:50,28 --> 00:01:50,968
they shall be

214
00:01:50,968 --> 00:01:51,656
drunken with

215
00:01:51,656 --> 00:01:52,344
their own blood

216
00:01:52,344 --> 00:01:53,032
as with sweet

217
00:01:53,032 --> 00:01:53,72
wine; and all

218
00:01:53,72 --> 00:01:54,408
flesh shall

219
00:01:54,408 --> 00:01:55,096
know that I the

220
00:01:55,096 --> 00:01:55,784
Lord am thy

221
00:01:55,784 --> 00:01:56,472
Savior and thy

222
00:01:56,472 --> 00:01:57,16
Redeemer, the

223
00:01:57,16 --> 00:01:57,184
Mighty One of Jacob.
