Chapter 6 Jacob recounts Jewish history: The

2
00:00:14,5 --> 00:00:29,0
 Babylonian captivity and return; the ministry and

3
00:00:29,0 --> 00:00:43,5
 crucifixion of the Holy One of Israel; the help

4
00:00:43,5 --> 00:00:58,0
 received from the Gentiles; and the Jews’ latter-day

5
00:00:58,0 --> 00:01:12,5
 restoration when they believe in the Messiah. About

7
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:28,221
1 The words of Jacob, the brother of Nephi, which

8
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:28,721
 he spake unto the people of Nephi

9
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:33,792
2 Behold, my beloved brethren, I, Jacob, having

10
00:01:33,792 --> 00:01:39,363
 been called of God, and ordained after the manner of

11
00:01:39,363 --> 00:01:44,934
 his holy order, and having been consecrated by my

12
00:01:44,934 --> 00:01:50,505
 brother Nephi, unto whom ye look as a king or a

13
00:01:50,505 --> 00:01:56,076
 protector, and on whom ye depend for safety, behold

14
00:01:56,076 --> 00:02:01,647
 ye know that I have spoken unto you exceedingly

15
00:02:01,647 --> 00:02:07,218
 many things

16
00:02:07,16 --> 00:02:13,16
3 Nevertheless, I speak unto you again; for I am

17
00:02:13,16 --> 00:02:19,16
 desirous for the welfare of your souls. Yea, mine

18
00:02:19,16 --> 00:02:25,16
 anxiety is great for you; and ye yourselves know

19
00:02:25,16 --> 00:02:31,16
 that it ever has been. For I have exhorted you with

20
00:02:31,16 --> 00:02:37,16
 all diligence; and I have taught you the words of

21
00:02:37,16 --> 00:02:43,16
 my father; and I have spoken unto you concerning

22
00:02:43,16 --> 00:02:49,16
 all things which are written, from the creation of

23
00:02:49,16 --> 00:02:55,16
 the world

24
00:02:55,008 --> 00:03:01,151
4 And now, behold, I would speak unto you

25
00:03:01,151 --> 00:03:07,294
 concerning things which are, and which are to come;

26
00:03:07,294 --> 00:03:13,437
 wherefore, I will read you the words of Isaiah. And they

27
00:03:13,437 --> 00:03:19,58
 are the words which my brother has desired that I

28
00:03:19,58 --> 00:03:25,723
 should speak unto you. And I speak unto you for

29
00:03:25,723 --> 00:03:31,866
 your sakes, that ye may learn and glorify the name

30
00:03:31,866 --> 00:03:38,009
 of your God

31
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:44,599
5 And now, the words which I shall read are they

32
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:50,313
 which Isaiah spake concerning all the house of

33
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:56,027
 Israel; wherefore, they may be likened unto you, for

34
00:03:56,027 --> 00:04:01,741
 ye are of the house of Israel. And there are many

35
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:07,455
 things which have been spoken by Isaiah which may

36
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:13,169
 be likened unto you, because ye are of the house of

37
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:18,883
 Israel

38
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:25,325
6 And now, these are the words: Thus saith the

39
00:04:25,325 --> 00:04:32,125
 Lord God: Behold, I will lift up mine hand to the

40
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:38,925
 Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people; and

41
00:04:38,925 --> 00:04:45,725
 they shall bring thy sons in their arms, and thy

42
00:04:45,725 --> 00:04:52,525
 daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders

43
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:59,558
7 And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and

44
00:04:59,558 --> 00:05:06,891
 their queens thy nursing mothers; they shall bow down

45
00:05:06,891 --> 00:05:14,224
 to thee with their faces towards the earth, and

46
00:05:14,224 --> 00:05:21,557
 lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know

47
00:05:21,557 --> 00:05:28,89
 that I am the Lord; for they shall not be ashamed

48
00:05:28,89 --> 00:05:36,223
 that wait for me

49
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:43,102
8 And now I, Jacob, would speak somewhat

50
00:05:43,102 --> 00:05:50,102
 concerning these words. For behold, the Lord has shown me

51
00:05:50,102 --> 00:05:57,102
 that those who were at Jerusalem, from whence we

52
00:05:57,102 --> 00:06:04,102
 came, have been slain and carried away captive

53
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:26,878
9 Nevertheless, the Lord has shown unto me that

54
00:06:26,878 --> 00:06:49,592
 they should return again. And he also has shown unto

55
00:06:49,592 --> 00:07:12,306
 me that the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel,

56
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:35,02
 should manifest himself unto them in the flesh; and

57
00:07:35,02 --> 00:07:57,734
 after he should manifest himself they should

58
00:07:57,734 --> 00:08:20,448
 scourge him and crucify him, according to the words of

59
00:08:20,448 --> 00:08:43,162
 the angel who spake it unto me

60
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:48,456
10 And after they have hardened their hearts and

61
00:08:48,456 --> 00:08:53,256
 stiffened their necks against the Holy One of

62
00:08:53,256 --> 00:08:58,056
 Israel, behold, the judgments of the Holy One of Israel

63
00:08:58,056 --> 00:09:02,856
 shall come upon them. And the day cometh that

64
00:09:02,856 --> 00:09:07,656
 they shall be smitten and afflicted

65
00:09:07,58 --> 00:09:07,691
11 Wherefore, after they are driven to and fro,

66
00:09:07,691 --> 00:09:07,802
 for thus saith the angel, many shall be afflicted in

67
00:09:07,802 --> 00:09:07,913
 the flesh, and shall not be suffered to perish,

68
00:09:07,913 --> 00:09:08,024
 because of the prayers of the faithful; they shall

69
00:09:08,024 --> 00:09:08,135
 be scattered, and smitten, and hated;

70
00:09:08,135 --> 00:09:08,246
 nevertheless, the Lord will be merciful unto them, that when

71
00:09:08,246 --> 00:09:08,357
 they shall come to the knowledge of their Redeemer,

72
00:09:08,357 --> 00:09:08,468
 they shall be gathered together again to the

73
00:09:08,468 --> 00:09:08,579
 lands of their inheritance

74
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:09,023
12 And blessed are the Gentiles, they of whom the

75
00:09:09,023 --> 00:09:09,898
 prophet has written; for behold, if it so be that

76
00:09:09,898 --> 00:09:10,773
 they shall repent and fight not against Zion, and

77
00:09:10,773 --> 00:09:11,648
 do not unite themselves to that great and

78
00:09:11,648 --> 00:09:12,523
 abominable church, they shall be saved; for the Lord God

79
00:09:12,523 --> 00:09:13,398
 will fulfil his covenants which he has made unto

80
00:09:13,398 --> 00:09:14,273
 his children; and for this cause the prophet has

81
00:09:14,273 --> 00:09:15,148
 written these things

82
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:23,322
13 Wherefore, they that fight against Zion and the

83
00:09:23,322 --> 00:09:31,489
 covenant people of the Lord shall lick up the

84
00:09:31,489 --> 00:09:39,656
 dust of their feet; and the people of the Lord shall

85
00:09:39,656 --> 00:09:47,823
 not be ashamed. For the people of the Lord are

86
00:09:47,823 --> 00:09:55,99
 they who wait for him; for they still wait for the

87
00:09:55,99 --> 00:10:04,157
 coming of the Messiah

88
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:10,389
14 And behold, according to the words of the

89
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:16,676
 prophet, the Messiah will set himself again the second

90
00:10:16,676 --> 00:10:22,962
 time to recover them; wherefore, he will manifest

91
00:10:22,962 --> 00:10:29,248
 himself unto them in power and great glory, unto

92
00:10:29,248 --> 00:10:35,534
 the destruction of their enemies, when that day

93
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:41,82
 cometh when they shall believe in him; and none will

94
00:10:41,82 --> 00:10:48,106
 he destroy that believe in him

95
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:57,615
15 And they that believe not in him shall be

96
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:06,415
 destroyed, both by fire, and by tempest, and by

97
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:15,215
 earthquakes, and by bloodsheds, and by pestilence, and by

98
00:11:15,215 --> 00:11:24,015
 famine. And they shall know that the Lord is God,

99
00:11:24,015 --> 00:11:32,815
 the Holy One of Israel

100
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:41,125
16 For shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or

101
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:50,125
 the lawful captive delivered

102
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:57,676
17 But thus saith the Lord: Even the captives of

103
00:11:57,676 --> 00:12:05,176
 the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the

104
00:12:05,176 --> 00:12:12,676
 terrible shall be delivered; for the Mighty God

105
00:12:12,676 --> 00:12:20,176
 shall deliver his covenant people. For thus saith

106
00:12:20,176 --> 00:12:27,676
 the Lord: I will contend with them that contendeth

107
00:12:27,676 --> 00:12:35,176
 with thee

108
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:39,422
18 And I will feed them that oppress thee, with

109
00:12:39,422 --> 00:12:43,022
 their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with

110
00:12:43,022 --> 00:12:46,622
 their own blood as with sweet wine; and all flesh

111
00:12:46,622 --> 00:12:50,222
 shall know that I the Lord am thy Savior and thy

112
00:12:50,222 --> 00:12:53,822
 Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
