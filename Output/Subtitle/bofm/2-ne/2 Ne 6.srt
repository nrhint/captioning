00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 6 Jacob recounts Jewish history:

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
The Babylonian captivity and return; the

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
ministry and crucifixion of the Holy One of

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Israel; the help received from the Gentiles;

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and the Jews’ latter-day restoration when

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:08:27,
they believe in the Messiah. About 559–545 B.C. 

7
00:08:27,0 --> 00:08:27,0
1 The words of Jacob, the brother of

8
00:08:27,0 --> 00:08:13,
Nephi, which he spake unto the people of Nephi:

9
00:08:13,0 --> 00:08:13,0
2 Behold, my beloved brethren, I,

10
00:08:13,0 --> 00:08:13,0
Jacob, having been called of God, and

11
00:08:13,0 --> 00:08:13,0
ordained after the manner of his holy

12
00:08:13,0 --> 00:08:13,0
order, and having been consecrated by my

13
00:08:13,0 --> 00:08:13,0
brother Nephi, unto whom ye look as a

14
00:08:13,0 --> 00:08:13,0
king or a protector, and on whom ye

15
00:08:13,0 --> 00:08:13,0
depend for safety, behold ye know that I

16
00:08:13,0 --> 00:07:45,
have spoken unto you exceedingly many things.

17
00:07:45,0 --> 00:07:45,0
3 Nevertheless, I speak unto you

18
00:07:45,0 --> 00:07:45,0
again; for I am desirous for the

19
00:07:45,0 --> 00:07:45,0
welfare of your souls. Yea, mine anxiety

20
00:07:45,0 --> 00:07:45,0
is great for you; and ye yourselves

21
00:07:45,0 --> 00:07:45,0
know that it ever has been. For I

22
00:07:45,0 --> 00:07:45,0
have exhorted you with all diligence;

23
00:07:45,0 --> 00:07:45,0
and I have taught you the words of my

24
00:07:45,0 --> 00:07:45,0
father; and I have spoken unto you

25
00:07:45,0 --> 00:07:45,0
concerning all things which are

26
00:07:45,0 --> 00:11:16,
written, from the creation of the world.

27
00:11:16,0 --> 00:11:16,0
4 And now, behold, I would speak

28
00:11:16,0 --> 00:11:16,0
unto you concerning things which

29
00:11:16,0 --> 00:11:16,0
are, and which are to come;

30
00:11:16,0 --> 00:11:16,0
wherefore, I will read you the words of

31
00:11:16,0 --> 00:11:16,0
Isaiah. And they are the words which

32
00:11:16,0 --> 00:11:16,0
my brother has desired that I

33
00:11:16,0 --> 00:11:16,0
should speak unto you. And I speak

34
00:11:16,0 --> 00:11:16,0
unto you for your sakes, that ye may

35
00:11:16,0 --> 00:16:12,
learn and glorify the name of your God.

36
00:16:12,0 --> 00:16:12,0
5 And now, the words which I

37
00:16:12,0 --> 00:16:12,0
shall read are they which

38
00:16:12,0 --> 00:16:12,0
Isaiah spake concerning all the

39
00:16:12,0 --> 00:16:12,0
house of Israel; wherefore, they

40
00:16:12,0 --> 00:16:12,0
may be likened unto you, for

41
00:16:12,0 --> 00:16:12,0
ye are of the house of Israel.

42
00:16:12,0 --> 00:16:12,0
And there are many things

43
00:16:12,0 --> 00:16:12,0
which have been spoken by Isaiah

44
00:16:12,0 --> 00:16:12,0
which may be likened unto you,

45
00:16:12,0 --> 00:20:11,
because ye are of the house of Israel.

46
00:20:11,0 --> 00:20:11,0
6 And now, these are the

47
00:20:11,0 --> 00:20:11,0
words: Thus saith the Lord

48
00:20:11,0 --> 00:20:11,0
God: Behold, I will lift up

49
00:20:11,0 --> 00:20:11,0
mine hand to the Gentiles,

50
00:20:11,0 --> 00:20:11,0
and set up my standard to

51
00:20:11,0 --> 00:20:11,0
the people; and they shall

52
00:20:11,0 --> 00:20:11,0
bring thy sons in their arms,

53
00:20:11,0 --> 00:20:11,0
and thy daughters shall be

54
00:20:11,0 --> 00:23:56,
carried upon their shoulders.

55
00:23:56,0 --> 00:23:56,0
7 And kings shall be thy

56
00:23:56,0 --> 00:23:56,0
nursing fathers, and their

57
00:23:56,0 --> 00:23:56,0
queens thy nursing

58
00:23:56,0 --> 00:23:56,0
mothers; they shall bow down to

59
00:23:56,0 --> 00:23:56,0
thee with their faces

60
00:23:56,0 --> 00:23:56,0
towards the earth, and lick up

61
00:23:56,0 --> 00:23:56,0
the dust of thy feet; and

62
00:23:56,0 --> 00:23:56,0
thou shalt know that I am

63
00:23:56,0 --> 00:23:56,0
the Lord; for they shall

64
00:23:56,0 --> 00:25:26,
not be ashamed that wait for me.

65
00:25:26,0 --> 00:25:26,0
8 And now I, Jacob,

66
00:25:26,0 --> 00:25:26,0
would speak somewhat

67
00:25:26,0 --> 00:25:26,0
concerning these words. For

68
00:25:26,0 --> 00:25:26,0
behold, the Lord has shown

69
00:25:26,0 --> 00:25:26,0
me that those who were

70
00:25:26,0 --> 00:25:26,0
at Jerusalem, from whence

71
00:25:26,0 --> 00:25:26,0
we came, have been

72
00:25:26,0 --> 00:30:23,
slain and carried away captive.

73
00:30:23,0 --> 00:30:23,0
9 Nevertheless, the

74
00:30:23,0 --> 00:30:23,0
Lord has shown unto me

75
00:30:23,0 --> 00:30:23,0
that they should return

76
00:30:23,0 --> 00:30:23,0
again. And he also has

77
00:30:23,0 --> 00:30:23,0
shown unto me that the

78
00:30:23,0 --> 00:30:23,0
Lord God, the Holy One of

79
00:30:23,0 --> 00:30:23,0
Israel, should

80
00:30:23,0 --> 00:30:23,0
manifest himself unto them in

81
00:30:23,0 --> 00:30:23,0
the flesh; and after he

82
00:30:23,0 --> 00:30:23,0
should manifest

83
00:30:23,0 --> 00:30:23,0
himself they should scourge

84
00:30:23,0 --> 00:30:23,0
him and crucify him,

85
00:30:23,0 --> 00:30:23,0
according to the words of

86
00:30:23,0 --> 00:30:09,
the angel who spake it unto me.

87
00:30:09,0 --> 00:30:09,0
10 And after they

88
00:30:09,0 --> 00:30:09,0
have hardened their

89
00:30:09,0 --> 00:30:09,0
hearts and stiffened

90
00:30:09,0 --> 00:30:09,0
their necks against the

91
00:30:09,0 --> 00:30:09,0
Holy One of Israel,

92
00:30:09,0 --> 00:30:09,0
behold, the judgments

93
00:30:09,0 --> 00:30:09,0
of the Holy One of

94
00:30:09,0 --> 00:30:09,0
Israel shall come upon

95
00:30:09,0 --> 00:30:09,0
them. And the day

96
00:30:09,0 --> 00:30:09,0
cometh that they shall be

97
00:30:09,0 --> 00:32:21,
smitten and afflicted.

98
00:32:21,0 --> 00:32:21,0
11 Wherefore, after

99
00:32:21,0 --> 00:32:21,0
they are driven to

100
00:32:21,0 --> 00:32:21,0
and fro, for thus

101
00:32:21,0 --> 00:32:21,0
saith the angel, many

102
00:32:21,0 --> 00:32:21,0
shall be afflicted in

103
00:32:21,0 --> 00:32:21,0
the flesh, and

104
00:32:21,0 --> 00:32:21,0
shall not be suffered to

105
00:32:21,0 --> 00:32:21,0
perish, because of

106
00:32:21,0 --> 00:32:21,0
the prayers of the

107
00:32:21,0 --> 00:32:21,0
faithful; they shall

108
00:32:21,0 --> 00:32:21,0
be scattered, and

109
00:32:21,0 --> 00:32:21,0
smitten, and hated;

110
00:32:21,0 --> 00:32:21,0
nevertheless, the Lord

111
00:32:21,0 --> 00:32:21,0
will be merciful

112
00:32:21,0 --> 00:32:21,0
unto them, that when

113
00:32:21,0 --> 00:32:21,0
they shall come to

114
00:32:21,0 --> 00:32:21,0
the knowledge of their

115
00:32:21,0 --> 00:32:21,0
Redeemer, they

116
00:32:21,0 --> 00:32:21,0
shall be gathered

117
00:32:21,0 --> 00:32:21,0
together again to the

118
00:32:21,0 --> 00:31:53,
lands of their inheritance.

119
00:31:53,0 --> 00:31:53,0
12 And blessed are

120
00:31:53,0 --> 00:31:53,0
the Gentiles, they

121
00:31:53,0 --> 00:31:53,0
of whom the prophet

122
00:31:53,0 --> 00:31:53,0
has written; for

123
00:31:53,0 --> 00:31:53,0
behold, if it so be

124
00:31:53,0 --> 00:31:53,0
that they shall

125
00:31:53,0 --> 00:31:53,0
repent and fight not

126
00:31:53,0 --> 00:31:53,0
against Zion, and do

127
00:31:53,0 --> 00:31:53,0
not unite

128
00:31:53,0 --> 00:31:53,0
themselves to that great

129
00:31:53,0 --> 00:31:53,0
and abominable

130
00:31:53,0 --> 00:31:53,0
church, they shall be

131
00:31:53,0 --> 00:31:53,0
saved; for the Lord

132
00:31:53,0 --> 00:31:53,0
God will fulfil his

133
00:31:53,0 --> 00:31:53,0
covenants which he

134
00:31:53,0 --> 00:31:53,0
has made unto his

135
00:31:53,0 --> 00:31:53,0
children; and for

136
00:31:53,0 --> 00:31:53,0
this cause the prophet

137
00:31:53,0 --> 00:34:05,
has written these things.

138
00:34:05,0 --> 00:34:05,0
13 Wherefore, they

139
00:34:05,0 --> 00:34:05,0
that fight

140
00:34:05,0 --> 00:34:05,0
against Zion and the

141
00:34:05,0 --> 00:34:05,0
covenant people of

142
00:34:05,0 --> 00:34:05,0
the Lord shall lick

143
00:34:05,0 --> 00:34:05,0
up the dust of

144
00:34:05,0 --> 00:34:05,0
their feet; and the

145
00:34:05,0 --> 00:34:05,0
people of the Lord

146
00:34:05,0 --> 00:34:05,0
shall not be

147
00:34:05,0 --> 00:34:05,0
ashamed. For the people

148
00:34:05,0 --> 00:34:05,0
of the Lord are

149
00:34:05,0 --> 00:34:05,0
they who wait for

150
00:34:05,0 --> 00:34:05,0
him; for they still

151
00:34:05,0 --> 00:34:05,0
wait for the

152
00:34:05,0 --> 00:39:48,
coming of the Messiah.

153
00:39:48,0 --> 00:39:48,0
14 And behold,

154
00:39:48,0 --> 00:39:48,0
according to the

155
00:39:48,0 --> 00:39:48,0
words of the

156
00:39:48,0 --> 00:39:48,0
prophet, the Messiah

157
00:39:48,0 --> 00:39:48,0
will set himself

158
00:39:48,0 --> 00:39:48,0
again the second

159
00:39:48,0 --> 00:39:48,0
time to recover

160
00:39:48,0 --> 00:39:48,0
them; wherefore, he

161
00:39:48,0 --> 00:39:48,0
will manifest

162
00:39:48,0 --> 00:39:48,0
himself unto them in

163
00:39:48,0 --> 00:39:48,0
power and great

164
00:39:48,0 --> 00:39:48,0
glory, unto the

165
00:39:48,0 --> 00:39:48,0
destruction of

166
00:39:48,0 --> 00:39:48,0
their enemies, when

167
00:39:48,0 --> 00:39:48,0
that day cometh

168
00:39:48,0 --> 00:39:48,0
when they shall

169
00:39:48,0 --> 00:39:48,0
believe in him; and

170
00:39:48,0 --> 00:39:48,0
none will he

171
00:39:48,0 --> 00:44:16,
destroy that believe in him.

172
00:44:16,0 --> 00:44:16,0
15 And they that

173
00:44:16,0 --> 00:44:16,0
believe not in

174
00:44:16,0 --> 00:44:16,0
him shall be

175
00:44:16,0 --> 00:44:16,0
destroyed, both by

176
00:44:16,0 --> 00:44:16,0
fire, and by

177
00:44:16,0 --> 00:44:16,0
tempest, and by

178
00:44:16,0 --> 00:44:16,0
earthquakes, and by

179
00:44:16,0 --> 00:44:16,0
bloodsheds, and

180
00:44:16,0 --> 00:44:16,0
by pestilence,

181
00:44:16,0 --> 00:44:16,0
and by famine.

182
00:44:16,0 --> 00:44:16,0
And they shall

183
00:44:16,0 --> 00:44:16,0
know that the Lord

184
00:44:16,0 --> 00:44:16,0
is God, the

185
00:44:16,0 --> 00:43:48,
Holy One of Israel.

186
00:43:48,0 --> 00:43:48,0
16 For shall the

187
00:43:48,0 --> 00:43:48,0
prey be taken

188
00:43:48,0 --> 00:43:48,0
from the mighty,

189
00:43:48,0 --> 00:43:48,0
or the lawful

190
00:43:48,0 --> 00:43:20,
captive delivered?

191
00:43:20,0 --> 00:43:20,0
17 But thus

192
00:43:20,0 --> 00:43:20,0
saith the Lord:

193
00:43:20,0 --> 00:43:20,0
Even the captives

194
00:43:20,0 --> 00:43:20,0
of the mighty

195
00:43:20,0 --> 00:43:20,0
shall be taken

196
00:43:20,0 --> 00:43:20,0
away, and the

197
00:43:20,0 --> 00:43:20,0
prey of the

198
00:43:20,0 --> 00:43:20,0
terrible shall be

199
00:43:20,0 --> 00:43:20,0
delivered; for

200
00:43:20,0 --> 00:43:20,0
the Mighty God

201
00:43:20,0 --> 00:43:20,0
shall deliver

202
00:43:20,0 --> 00:43:20,0
his covenant

203
00:43:20,0 --> 00:43:20,0
people. For thus

204
00:43:20,0 --> 00:43:20,0
saith the Lord: I

205
00:43:20,0 --> 00:43:20,0
will contend

206
00:43:20,0 --> 00:43:20,0
with them that

207
00:43:20,0 --> 00:42:52,
contendeth with thee—

208
00:42:52,0 --> 00:42:52,0
18 And I will

209
00:42:52,0 --> 00:42:52,0
feed them that

210
00:42:52,0 --> 00:42:52,0
oppress thee,

211
00:42:52,0 --> 00:42:52,0
with their

212
00:42:52,0 --> 00:42:52,0
own flesh; and

213
00:42:52,0 --> 00:42:52,0
they shall be

214
00:42:52,0 --> 00:42:52,0
drunken with

215
00:42:52,0 --> 00:42:52,0
their own blood

216
00:42:52,0 --> 00:42:52,0
as with sweet

217
00:42:52,0 --> 00:42:52,0
wine; and all

218
