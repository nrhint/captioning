1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,4
Chapter 3 Joseph in Egypt saw the Nephites in

2
00:00:01,4 --> 00:00:02,8
 vision—He prophesied of Joseph Smith, the latter-day

3
00:00:02,8 --> 00:00:04,2
 seer; of Moses, who would deliver Israel; and of

4
00:00:04,2 --> 00:00:05,6
 the coming forth of the Book of Mormon. About

5
00:00:05,6 --> 00:00:07,0
 588–570 B.C.

6
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:11,975
1 And now I speak unto you, Joseph, my last-born.

7
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:15,975
 Thou wast born in the wilderness of mine

8
00:00:15,975 --> 00:00:19,975
 afflictions; yea, in the days of my greatest sorrow did thy

9
00:00:19,975 --> 00:00:23,975
 mother bear thee

10
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:38,924
2 And may the Lord consecrate also unto thee this

11
00:00:38,924 --> 00:00:53,924
 land, which is a most precious land, for thine

12
00:00:53,924 --> 00:01:08,924
 inheritance and the inheritance of thy seed with thy

13
00:01:08,924 --> 00:01:23,924
 brethren, for thy security forever, if it so be

14
00:01:23,924 --> 00:01:38,924
 that ye shall keep the commandments of the Holy One

15
00:01:38,924 --> 00:01:53,924
 of Israel

16
00:01:53,947 --> 00:02:27,947
3 And now, Joseph, my last-born, whom I have

17
00:02:27,947 --> 00:03:01,947
 brought out of the wilderness of mine afflictions, may

18
00:03:01,947 --> 00:03:35,947
 the Lord bless thee forever, for thy seed shall

19
00:03:35,947 --> 00:04:09,947
 not utterly be destroyed

20
00:04:09,516 --> 00:06:03,266
4 For behold, thou art the fruit of my loins; and

21
00:06:03,266 --> 00:07:57,016
 I am a descendant of Joseph who was carried

22
00:07:57,016 --> 00:09:50,766
 captive into Egypt. And great were the covenants of the

23
00:09:50,766 --> 00:11:44,516
 Lord which he made unto Joseph

24
00:11:44,07 --> 00:11:46,888
5 Wherefore, Joseph truly saw our day. And he

25
00:11:46,888 --> 00:11:49,706
 obtained a promise of the Lord, that out of the fruit

26
00:11:49,706 --> 00:11:52,524
 of his loins the Lord God would raise up a

27
00:11:52,524 --> 00:11:55,342
 righteous branch unto the house of Israel; not the

28
00:11:55,342 --> 00:11:58,16
 Messiah, but a branch which was to be broken off,

29
00:11:58,16 --> 00:12:00,978
 nevertheless, to be remembered in the covenants of the

30
00:12:00,978 --> 00:12:03,796
 Lord that the Messiah should be made manifest unto

31
00:12:03,796 --> 00:12:06,614
 them in the latter days, in the spirit of power,

32
00:12:06,614 --> 00:12:09,432
 unto the bringing of them out of darkness unto

33
00:12:09,432 --> 00:12:12,25
 light—yea, out of hidden darkness and out of captivity

34
00:12:12,25 --> 00:12:15,068
 unto freedom

35
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:34,636
6 For Joseph truly testified, saying: A seer shall

36
00:12:34,636 --> 00:12:53,303
 the Lord my God raise up, who shall be a choice

37
00:12:53,303 --> 00:13:11,97
 seer unto the fruit of my loins

38
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:19,791
7 Yea, Joseph truly said: Thus saith the Lord unto

39
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:27,791
 me: A choice seer will I raise up out of the

40
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:35,791
 fruit of thy loins; and he shall be esteemed highly

41
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:43,791
 among the fruit of thy loins. And unto him will I

42
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:51,791
 give commandment that he shall do a work for the

43
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:59,791
 fruit of thy loins, his brethren, which shall be of

44
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:07,791
 great worth unto them, even to the bringing of them

45
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:15,791
 to the knowledge of the covenants which I have

46
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:23,791
 made with thy fathers

47
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:29,563
8 And I will give unto him a commandment that he

48
00:14:29,563 --> 00:14:35,563
 shall do none other work, save the work which I

49
00:14:35,563 --> 00:14:41,563
 shall command him. And I will make him great in mine

50
00:14:41,563 --> 00:14:47,563
 eyes; for he shall do my work

51
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:10,642
11 But a seer will I raise up out of the fruit of

52
00:00:10,642 --> 00:00:13,309
 thy loins; and unto him will I give power to bring

53
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:15,976
 forth my word unto the seed of thy loins—and not

54
00:00:15,976 --> 00:00:18,643
 to the bringing forth my word only, saith the

55
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:21,31
 Lord, but to the convincing them of my word, which

56
00:00:21,31 --> 00:00:23,977
 shall have already gone forth among them

57
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:36,288
12 Wherefore, the fruit of thy loins shall write;

58
00:00:36,288 --> 00:00:48,652
 and the fruit of the loins of Judah shall write;

59
00:00:48,652 --> 00:01:01,016
 and that which shall be written by the fruit of thy

60
00:01:01,016 --> 00:01:13,38
 loins, and also that which shall be written by

61
00:01:13,38 --> 00:01:25,744
 the fruit of the loins of Judah, shall grow

62
00:01:25,744 --> 00:01:38,108
 together, unto the confounding of false doctrines and

63
00:01:38,108 --> 00:01:50,472
 laying down of contentions, and establishing peace

64
00:01:50,472 --> 00:02:02,836
 among the fruit of thy loins, and bringing them to

65
00:02:02,836 --> 00:02:15,2
 the knowledge of their fathers in the latter days,

66
00:02:15,2 --> 00:02:27,564
 and also to the knowledge of my covenants, saith

67
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:39,928
 the Lord

68
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:43,493
13 And out of weakness he shall be made strong, in

69
00:02:43,493 --> 00:02:47,493
 that day when my work shall commence among all my

70
00:02:47,493 --> 00:02:51,493
 people, unto the restoring thee, O house of

71
00:02:51,493 --> 00:02:55,493
 Israel, saith the Lord

72
00:02:55,442 --> 00:03:02,109
14 And thus prophesied Joseph, saying: Behold,

73
00:03:02,109 --> 00:03:08,776
 that seer will the Lord bless; and they that seek to

74
00:03:08,776 --> 00:03:15,443
 destroy him shall be confounded; for this promise,

75
00:03:15,443 --> 00:03:22,11
 which I have obtained of the Lord, of the fruit

76
00:03:22,11 --> 00:03:28,777
 of my loins, shall be fulfilled. Behold, I am sure

77
00:03:28,777 --> 00:03:35,444
 of the fulfilling of this promise

78
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:38,515
15 And his name shall be called after me; and it

79
00:03:38,515 --> 00:03:41,715
 shall be after the name of his father. And he shall

80
00:03:41,715 --> 00:03:44,915
 be like unto me; for the thing, which the Lord

81
00:03:44,915 --> 00:03:48,115
 shall bring forth by his hand, by the power of the

82
00:03:48,115 --> 00:03:51,315
 Lord shall bring my people unto salvation

83
00:03:51,264 --> 00:05:15,014
16 Yea, thus prophesied Joseph: I am sure of this

84
00:05:15,014 --> 00:06:38,764
 thing, even as I am sure of the promise of Moses;

85
00:06:38,764 --> 00:08:02,514
 for the Lord hath said unto me, I will preserve

86
00:08:02,514 --> 00:09:26,264
 thy seed forever

87
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:49,913
17 And the Lord hath said: I will raise up a

88
00:09:49,913 --> 00:10:13,627
 Moses; and I will give power unto him in a rod; and I

89
00:10:13,627 --> 00:10:37,341
 will give judgment unto him in writing. Yet I will

90
00:10:37,341 --> 00:11:01,055
 not loose his tongue, that he shall speak much,

91
00:11:01,055 --> 00:11:24,769
 for I will not make him mighty in speaking. But I

92
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:48,483
 will write unto him my law, by the finger of mine

93
00:11:48,483 --> 00:12:12,197
 own hand; and I will make a spokesman for him

94
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:11,175
20 And they shall cry from the dust; yea, even

95
00:00:11,175 --> 00:00:14,375
 repentance unto their brethren, even after many

96
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:17,575
 generations have gone by them. And it shall come to

97
00:00:17,575 --> 00:00:20,775
 pass that their cry shall go, even according to the

98
00:00:20,775 --> 00:00:23,975
 simpleness of their words

99
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:46,591
21 Because of their faith their words shall

100
00:00:46,591 --> 00:01:09,258
 proceed forth out of my mouth unto their brethren who

101
00:01:09,258 --> 00:01:31,925
 are the fruit of thy loins; and the weakness of

102
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:54,592
 their words will I make strong in their faith, unto

103
00:01:54,592 --> 00:02:17,259
 the remembering of my covenant which I made unto thy

104
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:39,926
 fathers

105
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:47,493
22 And now, behold, my son Joseph, after this

106
00:02:47,493 --> 00:02:55,493
 manner did my father of old prophesy

107
00:02:55,442 --> 00:03:08,775
23 Wherefore, because of this covenant thou art

108
00:03:08,775 --> 00:03:22,108
 blessed; for thy seed shall not be destroyed, for

109
00:03:22,108 --> 00:03:35,441
 they shall hearken unto the words of the book

110
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,601
24 And there shall rise up one mighty among them,

111
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:39,887
 who shall do much good, both in word and in deed,

112
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,173
 being an instrument in the hands of God, with

113
00:03:42,173 --> 00:03:44,459
 exceeding faith, to work mighty wonders, and do that

114
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,745
 thing which is great in the sight of God, unto the

115
00:03:46,745 --> 00:03:49,031
 bringing to pass much restoration unto the house

116
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:51,317
 of Israel, and unto the seed of thy brethren

117
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:51,264
25 And now, blessed art thou, Joseph. Behold, thou

118
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:51,264
 art little; wherefore hearken unto the words of

119
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:51,264
 thy brother, Nephi, and it shall be done unto thee

120
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:51,264
 even according to the words which I have spoken.

121
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:51,264
 Remember the words of thy dying father. Amen.
