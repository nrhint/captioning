1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:03,2
Chapter 3 Joseph in Egypt saw the

2
00:00:03,2 --> 00:00:06,4
Nephites in vision—He prophesied of Joseph

3
00:00:06,4 --> 00:00:09,6
Smith, the latter-day seer; of Moses, who

4
00:00:09,6 --> 00:00:12,8
would deliver Israel; and of the coming forth

5
00:00:12,8 --> 00:00:16,383
of the Book of Mormon. About 588–570 B.C. 

6
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:17,383
1 And now I speak unto you,

7
00:00:17,383 --> 00:00:18,383
Joseph, my last-born. Thou wast born

8
00:00:18,383 --> 00:00:19,383
in the wilderness of mine

9
00:00:19,383 --> 00:00:20,383
afflictions; yea, in the days of my

10
00:00:20,383 --> 00:00:21,321
greatest sorrow did thy mother bear thee.

11
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:23,821
2 And may the Lord consecrate

12
00:00:23,821 --> 00:00:26,321
also unto thee this land, which is

13
00:00:26,321 --> 00:00:28,821
a most precious land, for thine

14
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:31,321
inheritance and the inheritance

15
00:00:31,321 --> 00:00:33,821
of thy seed with thy brethren,

16
00:00:33,821 --> 00:00:36,321
for thy security forever, if it

17
00:00:36,321 --> 00:00:38,821
so be that ye shall keep the

18
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:41,174
commandments of the Holy One of Israel.

19
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:42,507
3 And now, Joseph, my

20
00:00:42,507 --> 00:00:43,84
last-born, whom I have brought out

21
00:00:43,84 --> 00:00:45,173
of the wilderness of mine

22
00:00:45,173 --> 00:00:46,506
afflictions, may the Lord

23
00:00:46,506 --> 00:00:47,839
bless thee forever, for thy

24
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:49,116
seed shall not utterly be destroyed.

25
00:00:49,116 --> 00:00:48,973
4 For behold, thou art

26
00:00:48,973 --> 00:00:48,83
the fruit of my loins; and

27
00:00:48,83 --> 00:00:48,687
I am a descendant of

28
00:00:48,687 --> 00:00:48,544
Joseph who was carried

29
00:00:48,544 --> 00:00:48,401
captive into Egypt. And great

30
00:00:48,401 --> 00:00:48,258
were the covenants of the

31
00:00:48,258 --> 00:00:48,181
Lord which he made unto Joseph.

32
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:48,276
5 Wherefore, Joseph

33
00:00:48,276 --> 00:00:48,371
truly saw our day. And he

34
00:00:48,371 --> 00:00:48,466
obtained a promise of the

35
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:48,561
Lord, that out of the

36
00:00:48,561 --> 00:00:48,656
fruit of his loins the

37
00:00:48,656 --> 00:00:48,751
Lord God would raise up a

38
00:00:48,751 --> 00:00:48,846
righteous branch unto the

39
00:00:48,846 --> 00:00:48,941
house of Israel; not

40
00:00:48,941 --> 00:00:49,036
the Messiah, but a branch

41
00:00:49,036 --> 00:00:49,131
which was to be broken

42
00:00:49,131 --> 00:00:49,226
off, nevertheless, to be

43
00:00:49,226 --> 00:00:49,321
remembered in the

44
00:00:49,321 --> 00:00:49,416
covenants of the Lord that the

45
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:49,511
Messiah should be made

46
00:00:49,511 --> 00:00:49,606
manifest unto them in

47
00:00:49,606 --> 00:00:49,701
the latter days, in the

48
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:49,796
spirit of power, unto the

49
00:00:49,796 --> 00:00:49,891
bringing of them out of

50
00:00:49,891 --> 00:00:49,986
darkness unto light—yea,

51
00:00:49,986 --> 00:00:50,081
out of hidden darkness

52
00:00:50,081 --> 00:00:50,584
and out of captivity unto freedom.

53
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:51,917
6 For Joseph truly

54
00:00:51,917 --> 00:00:53,25
testified, saying: A

55
00:00:53,25 --> 00:00:54,583
seer shall the Lord my

56
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:55,916
God raise up, who

57
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:57,249
shall be a choice seer

58
00:00:57,249 --> 00:00:58,992
unto the fruit of my loins.

59
00:00:58,992 --> 00:00:59,392
7 Yea, Joseph truly

60
00:00:59,392 --> 00:00:59,792
said: Thus saith the

61
00:00:59,792 --> 00:01:00,192
Lord unto me: A choice

62
00:01:00,192 --> 00:01:00,592
seer will I raise up

63
00:01:00,592 --> 00:01:00,992
out of the fruit of

64
00:01:00,992 --> 00:01:01,392
thy loins; and he

65
00:01:01,392 --> 00:01:01,792
shall be esteemed highly

66
00:01:01,792 --> 00:01:02,192
among the fruit of

67
00:01:02,192 --> 00:01:02,592
thy loins. And unto

68
00:01:02,592 --> 00:01:02,992
him will I give

69
00:01:02,992 --> 00:01:03,392
commandment that he shall do

70
00:01:03,392 --> 00:01:03,792
a work for the fruit

71
00:01:03,792 --> 00:01:04,192
of thy loins, his

72
00:01:04,192 --> 00:01:04,592
brethren, which shall

73
00:01:04,592 --> 00:01:04,992
be of great worth unto

74
00:01:04,992 --> 00:01:05,392
them, even to the

75
00:01:05,392 --> 00:01:05,792
bringing of them to the

76
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,192
knowledge of the

77
00:01:06,192 --> 00:01:06,592
covenants which I have

78
00:01:06,592 --> 00:01:06,967
made with thy fathers.

79
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:07,411
8 And I will give

80
00:01:07,411 --> 00:01:07,855
unto him a commandment

81
00:01:07,855 --> 00:01:08,299
that he shall do

82
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:08,743
none other work, save

83
00:01:08,743 --> 00:01:09,187
the work which I

84
00:01:09,187 --> 00:01:09,631
shall command him. And

85
00:01:09,631 --> 00:01:10,075
I will make him

86
00:01:10,075 --> 00:01:10,519
great in mine eyes; for

87
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:10,437
he shall do my work.

88
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:10,866
9 And he shall be

89
00:01:10,866 --> 00:01:11,295
great like unto

90
00:01:11,295 --> 00:01:11,724
Moses, whom I

91
00:01:11,724 --> 00:01:12,153
have said I would

92
00:01:12,153 --> 00:01:12,582
raise up unto you,

93
00:01:12,582 --> 00:01:13,011
to deliver my

94
00:01:13,011 --> 00:01:13,907
people, O house of Israel.

95
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,107
10 And Moses

96
00:01:16,107 --> 00:01:18,307
will I raise up,

97
00:01:18,307 --> 00:01:20,507
to deliver thy

98
00:01:20,507 --> 00:01:22,707
people out of

99
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:24,885
the land of Egypt.

100
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:25,385
11 But a seer

101
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:25,885
will I raise

102
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:26,385
up out of the

103
00:01:26,385 --> 00:01:26,885
fruit of thy

104
00:01:26,885 --> 00:01:27,385
loins; and unto

105
00:01:27,385 --> 00:01:27,885
him will I

106
00:01:27,885 --> 00:01:28,385
give power to

107
00:01:28,385 --> 00:01:28,885
bring forth my

108
00:01:28,885 --> 00:01:29,385
word unto the

109
00:01:29,385 --> 00:01:29,885
seed of thy

110
00:01:29,885 --> 00:01:30,385
loins—and not to

111
00:01:30,385 --> 00:01:30,885
the bringing

112
00:01:30,885 --> 00:01:31,385
forth my word

113
00:01:31,385 --> 00:01:31,885
only, saith the

114
00:01:31,885 --> 00:01:32,385
Lord, but to

115
00:01:32,385 --> 00:01:32,885
the convincing

116
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:33,385
them of my

117
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:33,885
word, which shall

118
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:34,385
have already

119
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:34,795
gone forth among them.

120
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:34,768
12 Wherefore,

121
00:01:34,768 --> 00:01:34,741
the fruit of

122
00:01:34,741 --> 00:01:34,714
thy loins

123
00:01:34,714 --> 00:01:34,687
shall write;

124
00:01:34,687 --> 00:01:34,66
and the fruit

125
00:01:34,66 --> 00:01:34,633
of the loins

126
00:01:34,633 --> 00:01:34,606
of Judah shall

127
00:01:34,606 --> 00:01:34,579
write; and

128
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:34,552
that which

129
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:34,525
shall be written

130
00:01:34,525 --> 00:01:34,498
by the fruit

131
00:01:34,498 --> 00:01:34,471
of thy

132
00:01:34,471 --> 00:01:34,444
loins, and also

133
00:01:34,444 --> 00:01:34,417
that which

134
00:01:34,417 --> 00:01:34,39
shall be written

135
00:01:34,39 --> 00:01:34,363
by the fruit

136
00:01:34,363 --> 00:01:34,336
of the loins

137
00:01:34,336 --> 00:01:34,309
of Judah,

138
00:01:34,309 --> 00:01:34,282
shall grow

139
00:01:34,282 --> 00:01:34,255
together, unto the

140
00:01:34,255 --> 00:01:34,228
confounding

141
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:34,201
of false

142
00:01:34,201 --> 00:01:34,174
doctrines and

143
00:01:34,174 --> 00:01:34,147
laying down of

144
00:01:34,147 --> 00:01:34,12
contentions,

145
00:01:34,12 --> 00:01:34,093
and

146
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:34,066
establishing peace

147
00:01:34,066 --> 00:01:34,039
among the fruit

148
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:34,012
of thy loins,

149
00:01:34,012 --> 00:01:33,985
and bringing

150
00:01:33,985 --> 00:01:33,958
them to the

151
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:33,931
knowledge of

152
00:01:33,931 --> 00:01:33,904
their fathers

153
00:01:33,904 --> 00:01:33,877
in the latter

154
00:01:33,877 --> 00:01:33,85
days, and

155
00:01:33,85 --> 00:01:33,823
also to the

156
00:01:33,823 --> 00:01:33,86
knowledge of my covenants, saith the Lord.

157
00:01:33,86 --> 00:01:34,629
13 And out

158
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:35,398
of weakness

159
00:01:35,398 --> 00:01:36,167
he shall be

160
00:01:36,167 --> 00:01:36,936
made strong,

161
00:01:36,936 --> 00:01:37,705
in that day

162
00:01:37,705 --> 00:01:38,474
when my work

163
00:01:38,474 --> 00:01:39,243
shall

164
00:01:39,243 --> 00:01:40,012
commence among

165
00:01:40,012 --> 00:01:40,781
all my people,

166
00:01:40,781 --> 00:01:41,55
unto the

167
00:01:41,55 --> 00:01:42,319
restoring

168
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,088
thee, O house of

169
00:01:43,088 --> 00:01:43,77
Israel, saith the Lord.

170
00:01:43,77 --> 00:01:44,353
14 And thus

171
00:01:44,353 --> 00:01:44,936
prophesied

172
00:01:44,936 --> 00:01:45,519
Joseph,

173
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:46,102
saying:

174
00:01:46,102 --> 00:01:46,685
Behold, that

175
00:01:46,685 --> 00:01:47,268
seer will the

176
00:01:47,268 --> 00:01:47,851
Lord bless;

177
00:01:47,851 --> 00:01:48,434
and they

178
00:01:48,434 --> 00:01:49,017
that seek to

179
00:01:49,017 --> 00:01:49,6
destroy

180
00:01:49,6 --> 00:01:50,183
him shall be

181
00:01:50,183 --> 00:01:50,766
confounded;

182
00:01:50,766 --> 00:01:51,349
for this

183
00:01:51,349 --> 00:01:51,932
promise,

184
00:01:51,932 --> 00:01:52,515
which I have

185
00:01:52,515 --> 00:01:53,098
obtained of

186
00:01:53,098 --> 00:01:53,681
the Lord,

187
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:54,264
of the fruit

188
00:01:54,264 --> 00:01:54,847
of my

189
00:01:54,847 --> 00:01:55,43
loins, shall be

190
00:01:55,43 --> 00:01:56,013
fulfilled.

191
00:01:56,013 --> 00:01:56,596
Behold, I

192
00:01:56,596 --> 00:01:57,179
am sure of

193
00:01:57,179 --> 00:01:57,117
the fulfilling of this promise;

194
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:57,572
15 And his

195
00:01:57,572 --> 00:01:58,027
name

196
00:01:58,027 --> 00:01:58,482
shall be

197
00:01:58,482 --> 00:01:58,937
called after

198
00:01:58,937 --> 00:01:59,392
me; and it

199
00:01:59,392 --> 00:01:59,847
shall be

200
00:01:59,847 --> 00:02:00,302
after the

201
00:02:00,302 --> 00:02:00,757
name of his

202
00:02:00,757 --> 00:02:01,212
father.

203
00:02:01,212 --> 00:02:01,667
And he shall

204
00:02:01,667 --> 00:02:02,122
be like

205
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:02,577
unto me;

206
00:02:02,577 --> 00:02:03,032
for the

207
00:02:03,032 --> 00:02:03,487
thing, which

208
00:02:03,487 --> 00:02:03,942
the Lord

209
00:02:03,942 --> 00:02:04,397
shall bring

210
00:02:04,397 --> 00:02:04,852
forth by

211
00:02:04,852 --> 00:02:05,307
his hand,

212
00:02:05,307 --> 00:02:05,762
by the

213
00:02:05,762 --> 00:02:06,217
power of the

214
00:02:06,217 --> 00:02:06,672
Lord shall

215
00:02:06,672 --> 00:02:07,027
bring my people unto salvation.

216
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:07,792
16 Yea,

217
00:02:07,792 --> 00:02:08,557
thus

218
00:02:08,557 --> 00:02:09,322
prophesied

219
00:02:09,322 --> 00:02:10,087
Joseph: I am

220
00:02:10,087 --> 00:02:10,852
sure of

221
00:02:10,852 --> 00:02:11,617
this

222
00:02:11,617 --> 00:02:12,382
thing, even

223
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,147
as I am

224
00:02:13,147 --> 00:02:13,912
sure of the

225
00:02:13,912 --> 00:02:14,677
promise

226
00:02:14,677 --> 00:02:15,442
of Moses;

227
00:02:15,442 --> 00:02:16,207
for the

228
00:02:16,207 --> 00:02:16,972
Lord hath

229
00:02:16,972 --> 00:02:17,737
said

230
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:18,502
unto me, I

231
00:02:18,502 --> 00:02:19,267
will

232
00:02:19,267 --> 00:02:20,407
preserve thy seed forever.

233
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:20,715
17 And

234
00:02:20,715 --> 00:02:21,023
the Lord

235
00:02:21,023 --> 00:02:21,331
hath

236
00:02:21,331 --> 00:02:21,639
said: I

237
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:21,947
will raise

238
00:02:21,947 --> 00:02:22,255
up a

239
00:02:22,255 --> 00:02:22,563
Moses; and

240
00:02:22,563 --> 00:02:22,871
I will

241
00:02:22,871 --> 00:02:23,179
give

242
00:02:23,179 --> 00:02:23,487
power unto

243
00:02:23,487 --> 00:02:23,795
him in a

244
00:02:23,795 --> 00:02:24,103
rod; and

245
00:02:24,103 --> 00:02:24,411
I will

246
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:24,719
give

247
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:25,027
judgment

248
00:02:25,027 --> 00:02:25,335
unto him

249
00:02:25,335 --> 00:02:25,643
in

250
00:02:25,643 --> 00:02:25,951
writing. Yet I

251
00:02:25,951 --> 00:02:26,259
will

252
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:26,567
not loose

253
00:02:26,567 --> 00:02:26,875
his

254
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:27,183
tongue, that

255
00:02:27,183 --> 00:02:27,491
he

256
00:02:27,491 --> 00:02:27,799
shall speak

257
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:28,107
much,

258
00:02:28,107 --> 00:02:28,415
for I will

259
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:28,723
not

260
00:02:28,723 --> 00:02:29,031
make him

261
00:02:29,031 --> 00:02:29,339
mighty in

262
00:02:29,339 --> 00:02:29,647


263
00:02:29,647 --> 00:02:29,955
speaking. But I

264
00:02:29,955 --> 00:02:30,263
will

265
00:02:30,263 --> 00:02:30,571
write unto

266
00:02:30,571 --> 00:02:30,879
him my

267
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:31,187
law, by

268
00:02:31,187 --> 00:02:31,495
the

269
00:02:31,495 --> 00:02:31,803
finger of

270
00:02:31,803 --> 00:02:32,111
mine own

271
00:02:32,111 --> 00:02:32,285
hand; and I will make a spokesman for him.

272
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:32,555
18 And

273
00:02:32,555 --> 00:02:32,825
the

274
00:02:32,825 --> 00:02:33,095
Lord said

275
00:02:33,095 --> 00:02:33,365
unto me

276
00:02:33,365 --> 00:02:33,635
also:

277
00:02:33,635 --> 00:02:33,905
I will

278
00:02:33,905 --> 00:02:34,175

00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:34,715
the

281
00:02:34,715 --> 00:02:34,985
fruit of

282
00:02:34,985 --> 00:02:35,255
thy

283
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:35,525
loins; and

284
00:02:35,525 --> 00:02:35,795

00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:37,145
And I,

00:02:37,145 --> 00:02:37,415
behold, I

291
00:02:37,415 --> 00:02:37,685

00:02:39,845 --> 00:02:40,115
fruit of
