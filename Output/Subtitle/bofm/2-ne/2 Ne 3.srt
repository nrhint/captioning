00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 3 Joseph in Egypt saw the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Nephites in vision—He prophesied of Joseph

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Smith, the latter-day seer; of Moses, who

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
would deliver Israel; and of the coming forth

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:08:11,
of the Book of Mormon. About 588–570 B.C. 

6
00:08:11,0 --> 00:08:11,0
1 And now I speak unto you,

7
00:08:11,0 --> 00:08:11,0
Joseph, my last-born. Thou wast born

8
00:08:11,0 --> 00:08:11,0
in the wilderness of mine

9
00:08:11,0 --> 00:08:11,0
afflictions; yea, in the days of my

10
00:08:11,0 --> 00:17:06,
greatest sorrow did thy mother bear thee.

11
00:17:06,0 --> 00:17:06,0
2 And may the Lord consecrate

12
00:17:06,0 --> 00:17:06,0
also unto thee this land, which is

13
00:17:06,0 --> 00:17:06,0
a most precious land, for thine

14
00:17:06,0 --> 00:17:06,0
inheritance and the inheritance

15
00:17:06,0 --> 00:17:06,0
of thy seed with thy brethren,

16
00:17:06,0 --> 00:17:06,0
for thy security forever, if it

17
00:17:06,0 --> 00:17:06,0
so be that ye shall keep the

18
00:17:06,0 --> 00:24:50,
commandments of the Holy One of Israel.

19
00:24:50,0 --> 00:24:50,0
3 And now, Joseph, my

20
00:24:50,0 --> 00:24:50,0
last-born, whom I have brought out

21
00:24:50,0 --> 00:24:50,0
of the wilderness of mine

22
00:24:50,0 --> 00:24:50,0
afflictions, may the Lord

23
00:24:50,0 --> 00:24:50,0
bless thee forever, for thy

24
00:24:50,0 --> 00:24:22,
seed shall not utterly be destroyed.

25
00:24:22,0 --> 00:24:22,0
4 For behold, thou art

26
00:24:22,0 --> 00:24:22,0
the fruit of my loins; and

27
00:24:22,0 --> 00:24:22,0
I am a descendant of

28
00:24:22,0 --> 00:24:22,0
Joseph who was carried

29
00:24:22,0 --> 00:24:22,0
captive into Egypt. And great

30
00:24:22,0 --> 00:24:22,0
were the covenants of the

31
00:24:22,0 --> 00:26:34,
Lord which he made unto Joseph.

32
00:26:34,0 --> 00:26:34,0
5 Wherefore, Joseph

33
00:26:34,0 --> 00:26:34,0
truly saw our day. And he

34
00:26:34,0 --> 00:26:34,0
obtained a promise of the

35
00:26:34,0 --> 00:26:34,0
Lord, that out of the

36
00:26:34,0 --> 00:26:34,0
fruit of his loins the

37
00:26:34,0 --> 00:26:34,0
Lord God would raise up a

38
00:26:34,0 --> 00:26:34,0
righteous branch unto the

39
00:26:34,0 --> 00:26:34,0
house of Israel; not

40
00:26:34,0 --> 00:26:34,0
the Messiah, but a branch

41
00:26:34,0 --> 00:26:34,0
which was to be broken

42
00:26:34,0 --> 00:26:34,0
off, nevertheless, to be

43
00:26:34,0 --> 00:26:34,0
remembered in the

44
00:26:34,0 --> 00:26:34,0
covenants of the Lord that the

45
00:26:34,0 --> 00:26:34,0
Messiah should be made

46
00:26:34,0 --> 00:26:34,0
manifest unto them in

47
00:26:34,0 --> 00:26:34,0
the latter days, in the

48
00:26:34,0 --> 00:26:34,0
spirit of power, unto the

49
00:26:34,0 --> 00:26:34,0
bringing of them out of

50
00:26:34,0 --> 00:26:34,0
darkness unto light—yea,

51
00:26:34,0 --> 00:26:34,0
out of hidden darkness

52
00:26:34,0 --> 00:26:06,
and out of captivity unto freedom.

53
00:26:06,0 --> 00:26:06,0
6 For Joseph truly

54
00:26:06,0 --> 00:26:06,0
testified, saying: A

55
00:26:06,0 --> 00:26:06,0
seer shall the Lord my

56
00:26:06,0 --> 00:26:06,0
God raise up, who

57
00:26:06,0 --> 00:26:06,0
shall be a choice seer

58
00:26:06,0 --> 00:38:03,
unto the fruit of my loins.

59
00:38:03,0 --> 00:38:03,0
7 Yea, Joseph truly

60
00:38:03,0 --> 00:38:03,0
said: Thus saith the

61
00:38:03,0 --> 00:38:03,0
Lord unto me: A choice

62
00:38:03,0 --> 00:38:03,0
seer will I raise up

63
00:38:03,0 --> 00:38:03,0
out of the fruit of

64
00:38:03,0 --> 00:38:03,0
thy loins; and he

65
00:38:03,0 --> 00:38:03,0
shall be esteemed highly

66
00:38:03,0 --> 00:38:03,0
among the fruit of

67
00:38:03,0 --> 00:38:03,0
thy loins. And unto

68
00:38:03,0 --> 00:38:03,0
him will I give

69
00:38:03,0 --> 00:38:03,0
commandment that he shall do

70
00:38:03,0 --> 00:38:03,0
a work for the fruit

71
00:38:03,0 --> 00:38:03,0
of thy loins, his

72
00:38:03,0 --> 00:38:03,0
brethren, which shall

73
00:38:03,0 --> 00:38:03,0
be of great worth unto

74
00:38:03,0 --> 00:38:03,0
them, even to the

75
00:38:03,0 --> 00:38:03,0
bringing of them to the

76
00:38:03,0 --> 00:38:03,0
knowledge of the

77
00:38:03,0 --> 00:38:03,0
covenants which I have

78
00:38:03,0 --> 00:50:30,
made with thy fathers.

79
00:50:30,0 --> 00:50:30,0
8 And I will give

80
00:50:30,0 --> 00:50:30,0
unto him a commandment

81
00:50:30,0 --> 00:50:30,0
that he shall do

82
00:50:30,0 --> 00:50:30,0
none other work, save

83
00:50:30,0 --> 00:50:30,0
the work which I

84
00:50:30,0 --> 00:50:30,0
shall command him. And

85
00:50:30,0 --> 00:50:30,0
I will make him

86
00:50:30,0 --> 00:50:30,0
great in mine eyes; for

87
00:50:30,0 --> 00:55:27,
he shall do my work.

88
00:55:27,0 --> 00:55:27,0
9 And he shall be

89
00:55:27,0 --> 00:55:27,0
great like unto

90
00:55:27,0 --> 00:55:27,0
Moses, whom I

91
00:55:27,0 --> 00:55:27,0
have said I would

92
00:55:27,0 --> 00:55:27,0
raise up unto you,

93
00:55:27,0 --> 00:55:27,0
to deliver my

94
00:55:27,0 --> 01:01:23,
people, O house of Israel.

95
01:01:23,0 --> 01:01:23,0
10 And Moses

96
01:01:23,0 --> 01:01:23,0
will I raise up,

97
01:01:23,0 --> 01:01:23,0
to deliver thy

98
01:01:23,0 --> 01:01:23,0
people out of

99
01:01:23,0 --> 01:04:54,
the land of Egypt.

100
01:04:54,0 --> 01:04:54,0
11 But a seer

101
01:04:54,0 --> 01:04:54,0
will I raise

102
01:04:54,0 --> 01:04:54,0
up out of the

103
01:04:54,0 --> 01:04:54,0
fruit of thy

104
01:04:54,0 --> 01:04:54,0
loins; and unto

105
01:04:54,0 --> 01:04:54,0
him will I

106
01:04:54,0 --> 01:04:54,0
give power to

107
01:04:54,0 --> 01:04:54,0
bring forth my

108
01:04:54,0 --> 01:04:54,0
word unto the

109
01:04:54,0 --> 01:04:54,0
seed of thy

110
01:04:54,0 --> 01:04:54,0
loins—and not to

111
01:04:54,0 --> 01:04:54,0
the bringing

112
01:04:54,0 --> 01:04:54,0
forth my word

113
01:04:54,0 --> 01:04:54,0
only, saith the

114
01:04:54,0 --> 01:04:54,0
Lord, but to

115
01:04:54,0 --> 01:04:54,0
the convincing

116
01:04:54,0 --> 01:04:54,0
them of my

117
01:04:54,0 --> 01:04:54,0
word, which shall

118
01:04:54,0 --> 01:04:54,0
have already

119
01:04:54,0 --> 01:06:38,
gone forth among them.

120
01:06:38,0 --> 01:06:38,0
12 Wherefore,

121
01:06:38,0 --> 01:06:38,0
the fruit of

122
01:06:38,0 --> 01:06:38,0
thy loins

123
01:06:38,0 --> 01:06:38,0
shall write;

124
01:06:38,0 --> 01:06:38,0
and the fruit

125
01:06:38,0 --> 01:06:38,0
of the loins

126
01:06:38,0 --> 01:06:38,0
of Judah shall

127
01:06:38,0 --> 01:06:38,0
write; and

128
01:06:38,0 --> 01:06:38,0
that which

129
01:06:38,0 --> 01:06:38,0
shall be written

130
01:06:38,0 --> 01:06:38,0
by the fruit

131
01:06:38,0 --> 01:06:38,0
of thy

132
01:06:38,0 --> 01:06:38,0
loins, and also

133
01:06:38,0 --> 01:06:38,0
that which

134
01:06:38,0 --> 01:06:38,0
shall be written

135
01:06:38,0 --> 01:06:38,0
by the fruit

136
01:06:38,0 --> 01:06:38,0
of the loins

137
01:06:38,0 --> 01:06:38,0
of Judah,

138
01:06:38,0 --> 01:06:38,0
shall grow

139
01:06:38,0 --> 01:06:38,0
together, unto the

140
01:06:38,0 --> 01:06:38,0
confounding

141
01:06:38,0 --> 01:06:38,0
of false

142
01:06:38,0 --> 01:06:38,0
doctrines and

143
01:06:38,0 --> 01:06:38,0
laying down of

144
01:06:38,0 --> 01:06:38,0
contentions,

145
01:06:38,0 --> 01:06:38,0
and

146
01:06:38,0 --> 01:06:38,0
establishing peace

147
01:06:38,0 --> 01:06:38,0
among the fruit

148
01:06:38,0 --> 01:06:38,0
of thy loins,

149
01:06:38,0 --> 01:06:38,0
and bringing

150
01:06:38,0 --> 01:06:38,0
them to the

151
01:06:38,0 --> 01:06:38,0
knowledge of

152
01:06:38,0 --> 01:06:38,0
their fathers

153
01:06:38,0 --> 01:06:38,0
in the latter

154
01:06:38,0 --> 01:06:38,0
days, and

155
01:06:38,0 --> 01:06:38,0
also to the

156
01:06:38,0 --> 01:10:09,
knowledge of my covenants, saith the Lord.

157
01:10:09,0 --> 01:10:09,0
13 And out

158
01:10:09,0 --> 01:10:09,0
of weakness

159
01:10:09,0 --> 01:10:09,0
he shall be

160
01:10:09,0 --> 01:10:09,0
made strong,

161
01:10:09,0 --> 01:10:09,0
in that day

162
01:10:09,0 --> 01:10:09,0
when my work

163
01:10:09,0 --> 01:10:09,0
shall

164
01:10:09,0 --> 01:10:09,0
commence among

165
01:10:09,0 --> 01:10:09,0
all my people,

166
01:10:09,0 --> 01:10:09,0
unto the

167
01:10:09,0 --> 01:10:09,0
restoring

168
01:10:09,0 --> 01:10:09,0
thee, O house of

169
01:10:09,0 --> 01:17:39,
Israel, saith the Lord.

170
01:17:39,0 --> 01:17:39,0
14 And thus

171
01:17:39,0 --> 01:17:39,0
prophesied

172
01:17:39,0 --> 01:17:39,0
Joseph,

173
01:17:39,0 --> 01:17:39,0
saying:

174
01:17:39,0 --> 01:17:39,0
Behold, that

175
01:17:39,0 --> 01:17:39,0
seer will the

176
01:17:39,0 --> 01:17:39,0
Lord bless;

177
01:17:39,0 --> 01:17:39,0
and they

178
01:17:39,0 --> 01:17:39,0
that seek to

179
01:17:39,0 --> 01:17:39,0
destroy

180
01:17:39,0 --> 01:17:39,0
him shall be

181
01:17:39,0 --> 01:17:39,0
confounded;

182
01:17:39,0 --> 01:17:39,0
for this

183
01:17:39,0 --> 01:17:39,0
promise,

184
01:17:39,0 --> 01:17:39,0
which I have

185
01:17:39,0 --> 01:17:39,0
obtained of

186
01:17:39,0 --> 01:17:39,0
the Lord,

187
01:17:39,0 --> 01:17:39,0
of the fruit

188
01:17:39,0 --> 01:17:39,0
of my

189
01:17:39,0 --> 01:17:39,0
loins, shall be

190
01:17:39,0 --> 01:17:39,0
fulfilled.

191
01:17:39,0 --> 01:17:39,0
Behold, I

192
01:17:39,0 --> 01:17:39,0
am sure of

193
01:17:39,0 --> 01:25:23,
the fulfilling of this promise;

194
01:25:23,0 --> 01:25:23,0
15 And his

195
01:25:23,0 --> 01:25:23,0
name

196
01:25:23,0 --> 01:25:23,0
shall be

197
01:25:23,0 --> 01:25:23,0
called after

198
01:25:23,0 --> 01:25:23,0
me; and it

199
01:25:23,0 --> 01:25:23,0
shall be

200
01:25:23,0 --> 01:25:23,0
after the

201
01:25:23,0 --> 01:25:23,0
name of his

202
01:25:23,0 --> 01:25:23,0
father.

203
01:25:23,0 --> 01:25:23,0
And he shall

204
01:25:23,0 --> 01:25:23,0
be like

205
01:25:23,0 --> 01:25:23,0
unto me;

206
01:25:23,0 --> 01:25:23,0
for the

207
01:25:23,0 --> 01:25:23,0
thing, which

208
01:25:23,0 --> 01:25:23,0
the Lord

209
01:25:23,0 --> 01:25:23,0
shall bring

210
01:25:23,0 --> 01:25:23,0
forth by

211
01:25:23,0 --> 01:25:23,0
his hand,

212
01:25:23,0 --> 01:25:23,0
by the

213
01:25:23,0 --> 01:25:23,0
power of the

214
01:25:23,0 --> 01:25:23,0
Lord shall

215
01:25:23,0 --> 01:28:19,
bring my people unto salvation.

216
01:28:19,0 --> 01:28:19,0
16 Yea,

217
01:28:19,0 --> 01:28:19,0
thus

218
01:28:19,0 --> 01:28:19,0
prophesied

219
01:28:19,0 --> 01:28:19,0
Joseph: I am

220
01:28:19,0 --> 01:28:19,0
sure of

221
01:28:19,0 --> 01:28:19,0
this

222
01:28:19,0 --> 01:28:19,0
thing, even

223
01:28:19,0 --> 01:28:19,0
as I am

224
01:28:19,0 --> 01:28:19,0
sure of the

225
01:28:19,0 --> 01:28:19,0
promise

226
01:28:19,0 --> 01:28:19,0
of Moses;

227
01:28:19,0 --> 01:28:19,0
for the

228
01:28:19,0 --> 01:28:19,0
Lord hath

229
01:28:19,0 --> 01:28:19,0
said

230
01:28:19,0 --> 01:28:19,0
unto me, I

231
01:28:19,0 --> 01:28:19,0
will

232
01:28:19,0 --> 01:31:49,
preserve thy seed forever.

233
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
17 And

234
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
the Lord

235
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
hath

236
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
said: I

237
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
will raise

238
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
up a

239
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
Moses; and

240
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
I will

241
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
give

242
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
power unto

243
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
him in a

244
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
rod; and

245
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
I will

246
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
give

247
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
judgment

248
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
unto him

249
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
in

250
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
writing. Yet I

251
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
will

252
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
not loose

253
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
his

254
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
tongue, that

255
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
he

256
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
shall speak

257
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
much,

258
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
for I will

259
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
not

260
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
make him

261
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
mighty in

262
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0


263
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
speaking. But I

264
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
will

265
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
write unto

266
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
him my

267
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
law, by

268
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
the

269
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
finger of

270
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
mine own

271
01:31:49,0 --> 01:38:58,
hand; and I will make a spokesman for him.

272
01:38:58,0 --> 01:38:58,0
18 And

273
01:38:58,0 --> 01:38:58,0
the

274
01:38:58,0 --> 01:38:58,0
Lord said

275
01:38:58,0 --> 01:38:58,0
unto me

276
01:38:58,0 --> 01:38:58,0
also:

277
01:38:58,0 --> 01:38:58,0
I will

278
01:38:58,0 --> 01:38:58,0
raise

279
01:38:58,0 --> 01:38:58,0

280
01:38:58,0 --> 01:38:58,0
the

281
01:38:58,0 --> 01:38:58,0
fruit of

282
01:38:58,0 --> 01:38:58,0
thy

283
01:38:58,0 --> 01:38:58,0
loins; and

284
01:38:58,0 --> 01:38:58,0
I will

285
01:38:58,0 --> 01:38:58,0
make

286
01:38:58,0 --> 01:38:58,0

288
01:38:58,0 --> 01:38:58,0
spokesman.

289
01:38:58,0 --> 01:38:58,0
And I,

290
01:38:58,0 --> 01:38:58,0
behold, I

291
01:38:58,0 --> 01:38:58,0
will

292
01:38:58,0 --> 01:38:58,0
give

293
01:38:58,0 --> 01:38:58,0

294
01:38:58,0 --> 01:38:58,0

01:38:58,0 --> 01:38:58,0
the

304
01:38:58,0 --> 01:38:58,0

thy

316
01:51:52,0 --> 01:51:52,0
the words

322
01:51:52,0 --> 01:51:52,0

01:51:52,0 --> 01:51:52,0
loins. And

329
01:51:52,0 --> 01:51:52,0
it shall

330
01:51:52,0 --> 01:51:52,0
be as

01:51:52,0 --> 01:51:52,0

335
01:51:52,0 --> 01:51:52,0
had cried

01:51:52,0 --> 01:51:52,0
them

338
01:51:52,0 --> 01:51:52,0

01:51:52,0 --> 01:51:52,0

01:58:02,0 --> 01:58:02,0
yea,

364
01:58:02,0 --> 01:58:02,0
And it

01:58:02,0 --> 01:58:02,0
according

375
01:58:02,0 --> 02:02:15,
to the simpleness of their words.

376
02:02:15,0 --> 02:02:15,0
21

377
02:02:15,0 --> 02:02:15,0
Because

420
02:03:27,0 --> 02:03:27,0

421
02:03:27,0 --> 02:03:27,0
And

02:03:27,0 --> 02:03:27,0
behold,
