00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:02,333
Chapter 11 Jacob saw his Redeemer—The law of Moses

2
00:00:02,333 --> 00:00:04,666
 typifies Christ and proves He will come. About

3
00:00:04,666 --> 00:00:06,999
 559–545 B.C.

4
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,975
1 And now, Jacob spake many more things to my

5
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:11,975
 people at that time; nevertheless only these things

6
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:13,975
 have I caused to be written, for the things which I

7
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:15,975
 have written sufficeth me

8
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,549
2 And now I, Nephi, write more of the words of

9
00:00:17,549 --> 00:00:19,149
 Isaiah, for my soul delighteth in his words. For I

10
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:20,749
 will liken his words unto my people, and I will send

11
00:00:20,749 --> 00:00:22,349
 them forth unto all my children, for he verily

12
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:23,949
 saw my Redeemer, even as I have seen him

13
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,067
3 And my brother, Jacob, also has seen him as I

14
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:26,21
 have seen him; wherefore, I will send their words

15
00:00:26,21 --> 00:00:27,353
 forth unto my children to prove unto them that my

16
00:00:27,353 --> 00:00:28,496
 words are true. Wherefore, by the words of three,

17
00:00:28,496 --> 00:00:29,639
 God hath said, I will establish my word.

18
00:00:29,639 --> 00:00:30,782
 Nevertheless, God sendeth more witnesses, and he proveth all

19
00:00:30,782 --> 00:00:31,925
 his words

20
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:41,232
4 Behold, my soul delighteth in proving unto my

21
00:00:41,232 --> 00:00:50,565
 people the truth of the coming of Christ; for, for

22
00:00:50,565 --> 00:00:59,898
 this end hath the law of Moses been given; and all

23
00:00:59,898 --> 00:01:09,231
 things which have been given of God from the

24
00:01:09,231 --> 00:01:18,564
 beginning of the world, unto man, are the typifying of

25
00:01:18,564 --> 00:01:27,897
 him

26
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:42,121
5 And also my soul delighteth in the covenants of

27
00:01:42,121 --> 00:01:56,521
 the Lord which he hath made to our fathers; yea,

28
00:01:56,521 --> 00:02:10,921
 my soul delighteth in his grace, and in his

29
00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:25,321
 justice, and power, and mercy in the great and eternal

30
00:02:25,321 --> 00:02:39,721
 plan of deliverance from death

31
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:47,493
6 And my soul delighteth in proving unto my people

32
00:02:47,493 --> 00:02:55,493
 that save Christ should come all men must perish

33
00:02:55,493 --> 00:03:03,493


34
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:11,417
7 For if there be no Christ there be no God; and

35
00:03:11,417 --> 00:03:19,417
 if there be no God we are not, for there could have

36
00:03:19,417 --> 00:03:27,417
 been no creation. But there is a God, and he is

37
00:03:27,417 --> 00:03:35,417
 Christ, and he cometh in the fulness of his own

38
00:03:35,417 --> 00:03:43,417
 time

39
00:03:43,29 --> 00:03:43,49
8 And now I write some of the words of Isaiah,

40
00:03:43,49 --> 00:03:43,69
 that whoso of my people shall see these words may

41
00:03:43,69 --> 00:03:43,89
 lift up their hearts and rejoice for all men. Now

42
00:03:43,89 --> 00:03:44,09
 these are the words, and ye may liken them unto you

43
00:03:44,09 --> 00:03:44,29
 and unto all men.
