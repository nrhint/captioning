00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 11 Jacob saw his Redeemer—The

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
law of Moses typifies Christ and

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:08:11,
proves He will come. About 559–545 B.C. 

4
00:08:11,0 --> 00:08:11,0
1 And now, Jacob spake many more

5
00:08:11,0 --> 00:08:11,0
things to my people at that time;

6
00:08:11,0 --> 00:08:11,0
nevertheless only these things have I

7
00:08:11,0 --> 00:08:11,0
caused to be written, for the

8
00:08:11,0 --> 00:09:41,
things which I have written sufficeth me.

9
00:09:41,0 --> 00:09:41,0
2 And now I, Nephi, write more of

10
00:09:41,0 --> 00:09:41,0
the words of Isaiah, for my soul

11
00:09:41,0 --> 00:09:41,0
delighteth in his words. For I will

12
00:09:41,0 --> 00:09:41,0
liken his words unto my people,

13
00:09:41,0 --> 00:09:41,0
and I will send them forth unto all

14
00:09:41,0 --> 00:09:41,0
my children, for he verily saw my

15
00:09:41,0 --> 00:09:27,
Redeemer, even as I have seen him.

16
00:09:27,0 --> 00:09:27,0
3 And my brother, Jacob, also

17
00:09:27,0 --> 00:09:27,0
has seen him as I have seen him;

18
00:09:27,0 --> 00:09:27,0
wherefore, I will send their

19
00:09:27,0 --> 00:09:27,0
words forth unto my children to

20
00:09:27,0 --> 00:09:27,0
prove unto them that my words

21
00:09:27,0 --> 00:09:27,0
are true. Wherefore, by the

22
00:09:27,0 --> 00:09:27,0
words of three, God hath said, I

23
00:09:27,0 --> 00:09:27,0
will establish my word.

24
00:09:27,0 --> 00:09:27,0
Nevertheless, God sendeth more

25
00:09:27,0 --> 00:12:37,
witnesses, and he proveth all his words.

26
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,0
4 Behold, my soul delighteth

27
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,0
in proving unto my people

28
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,0
the truth of the coming of

29
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,0
Christ; for, for this end hath

30
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,0
the law of Moses been

31
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,0
given; and all things which have

32
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,0
been given of God from the

33
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,0
beginning of the world, unto

34
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,
man, are the typifying of him.

35
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,0
5 And also my soul

36
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,0
delighteth in the covenants of

37
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,0
the Lord which he hath

38
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,0
made to our fathers; yea,

39
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,0
my soul delighteth in his

40
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,0
grace, and in his

41
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,0
justice, and power, and mercy in

42
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,0
the great and eternal

43
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,
plan of deliverance from death.

44
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,0
6 And my soul delighteth

45
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,0
in proving unto my people

46
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,0
that save Christ should

47
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,
come all men must perish.

48
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,0
7 For if there be no

49
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,0
Christ there be no God;

50
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,0
and if there be no

51
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,0
God we are not, for

52
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,0
there could have been no

53
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,0
creation. But there is

54
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,0
a God, and he is

55
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,0
Christ, and he cometh in

56
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,
the fulness of his own time.

57
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,0
8 And now I write

58
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,0
some of the words of

59
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,0
Isaiah, that whoso of my

60
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,0
people shall see

61
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,0
these words may lift up

62
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,0
their hearts and

63
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,0
rejoice for all men. Now

64
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,0
these are the words,

65
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,0
and ye may liken them

66
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,
unto you and unto all men.
