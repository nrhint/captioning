00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:09,667
Chapter 11 Jacob saw his Redeemer—The

2
00:00:09,667 --> 00:00:19,334
law of Moses typifies Christ and

3
00:00:19,334 --> 00:00:29,763
proves He will come. About 559–545 B.C. 

4
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:29,563
1 And now, Jacob spake many more

5
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:29,363
things to my people at that time;

6
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:29,163
nevertheless only these things have I

7
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:28,963
caused to be written, for the

8
00:00:28,963 --> 00:00:28,829
things which I have written sufficeth me.

9
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:28,686
2 And now I, Nephi, write more of

10
00:00:28,686 --> 00:00:28,543
the words of Isaiah, for my soul

11
00:00:28,543 --> 00:00:28,4
delighteth in his words. For I will

12
00:00:28,4 --> 00:00:28,257
liken his words unto my people,

13
00:00:28,257 --> 00:00:28,114
and I will send them forth unto all

14
00:00:28,114 --> 00:00:27,971
my children, for he verily saw my

15
00:00:27,971 --> 00:00:27,895
Redeemer, even as I have seen him.

16
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:28,195
3 And my brother, Jacob, also

17
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:28,495
has seen him as I have seen him;

18
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:28,795
wherefore, I will send their

19
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:29,095
words forth unto my children to

20
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:29,395
prove unto them that my words

21
00:00:29,395 --> 00:00:29,695
are true. Wherefore, by the

22
00:00:29,695 --> 00:00:29,995
words of three, God hath said, I

23
00:00:29,995 --> 00:00:30,295
will establish my word.

24
00:00:30,295 --> 00:00:30,595
Nevertheless, God sendeth more

25
00:00:30,595 --> 00:00:30,297
witnesses, and he proveth all his words.

26
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:30,186
4 Behold, my soul delighteth

27
00:00:30,186 --> 00:00:30,075
in proving unto my people

28
00:00:30,075 --> 00:00:29,964
the truth of the coming of

29
00:00:29,964 --> 00:00:29,853
Christ; for, for this end hath

30
00:00:29,853 --> 00:00:29,742
the law of Moses been

31
00:00:29,742 --> 00:00:29,631
given; and all things which have

32
00:00:29,631 --> 00:00:29,52
been given of God from the

33
00:00:29,52 --> 00:00:29,409
beginning of the world, unto

34
00:00:29,409 --> 00:00:29,363
man, are the typifying of him.

35
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:29,252
5 And also my soul

36
00:00:29,252 --> 00:00:29,141
delighteth in the covenants of

37
00:00:29,141 --> 00:00:29,03
the Lord which he hath

38
00:00:29,03 --> 00:00:28,919
made to our fathers; yea,

39
00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:28,808
my soul delighteth in his

40
00:00:28,808 --> 00:00:28,697
grace, and in his

41
00:00:28,697 --> 00:00:28,586
justice, and power, and mercy in

42
00:00:28,586 --> 00:00:28,475
the great and eternal

43
00:00:28,475 --> 00:00:28,428
plan of deliverance from death.

44
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:28,678
6 And my soul delighteth

45
00:00:28,678 --> 00:00:28,928
in proving unto my people

46
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:29,178
that save Christ should

47
00:00:29,178 --> 00:00:29,429
come all men must perish.

48
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:29,318
7 For if there be no

49
00:00:29,318 --> 00:00:29,207
Christ there be no God;

50
00:00:29,207 --> 00:00:29,096
and if there be no

51
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:28,985
God we are not, for

52
00:00:28,985 --> 00:00:28,874
there could have been no

53
00:00:28,874 --> 00:00:28,763
creation. But there is

54
00:00:28,763 --> 00:00:28,652
a God, and he is

55
00:00:28,652 --> 00:00:28,541
Christ, and he cometh in

56
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:28,495
the fulness of his own time.

57
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:28,495
8 And now I write

58
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:28,495
some of the words of

59
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:28,495
Isaiah, that whoso of my

60
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:28,495
people shall see

61
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:28,495
these words may lift up

62
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:28,495
their hearts and

63
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:28,495
rejoice for all men. Now

64
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:28,495
these are the words,

65
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:28,495
and ye may liken them

66
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:28,028
unto you and unto all men.
