00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:02,333
Chapter 17 Ephraim and Syria wage war against

2
00:00:02,333 --> 00:00:04,666
 Judah—Christ will be born of a virgin—Compare 
Isaiah

3
00:00:04,666 --> 00:00:06,999
 7. About 559–545 B.C.

4
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,575
1 And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son

5
00:00:09,575 --> 00:00:11,175
 of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that

6
00:00:11,175 --> 00:00:12,775
 Rezin, king of Syria, and Pekah the son of

7
00:00:12,775 --> 00:00:14,375
 Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war

8
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:15,975
 against it, but could not prevail against it

9
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,949
2 And it was told the house of David, saying:

10
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:19,949
 Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was

11
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:21,949
 moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of

12
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:23,949
 the wood are moved with the wind

13
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,924
3 Then said the Lord unto Isaiah: Go forth now to

14
00:00:25,924 --> 00:00:27,924
 meet Ahaz, thou and Shearjashub thy son, at the

15
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:29,924
 end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway

16
00:00:29,924 --> 00:00:31,924
 of the fuller’s field

17
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:55,899
4 And say unto him: Take heed, and be quiet; fear

18
00:00:55,899 --> 00:01:19,899
 not, neither be faint-hearted for the two tails of

19
00:01:19,899 --> 00:01:43,899
 these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of

20
00:01:43,899 --> 00:02:07,899
 Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah

21
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:59,594
5 Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah,

22
00:02:59,594 --> 00:03:51,594
 have taken evil counsel against thee, saying

23
00:03:51,264 --> 00:04:07,264
6 Let us go up against Judah and vex it, and let

24
00:04:07,264 --> 00:04:23,264
 us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in

25
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:39,264
 the midst of it, yea, the son of Tabeal

26
00:04:39,112 --> 00:06:54,612
7 Thus saith the Lord God: It shall not stand,

27
00:06:54,612 --> 00:09:10,112
 neither shall it come to pass

28
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:11,975
10 Moreover, the Lord spake again unto Ahaz,

29
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:15,975
 saying

30
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:19,949
11 Ask thee a sign of the Lord thy God; ask it

31
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:23,949
 either in the depths, or in the heights above

32
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:27,924
12 But Ahaz said: I will not ask, neither will I

33
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:31,924
 tempt the Lord

34
00:00:31,899 --> 00:01:03,899
13 And he said: Hear ye now, O house of David; is

35
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:35,899
 it a small thing for you to weary men, but will ye

36
00:01:35,899 --> 00:02:07,899
 weary my God also

37
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:42,261
14 Therefore, the Lord himself shall give you a

38
00:02:42,261 --> 00:03:16,928
 sign—Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and shall bear

39
00:03:16,928 --> 00:03:51,595
 a son, and shall call his name Immanuel

40
00:03:51,264 --> 00:04:15,264
15 Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know

41
00:04:15,264 --> 00:04:39,264
 to refuse the evil and to choose the good

42
00:04:39,112 --> 00:06:09,445
16 For before the child shall know to refuse the

43
00:06:09,445 --> 00:07:39,778
 evil and choose the good, the land that thou

44
00:07:39,778 --> 00:09:10,111
 abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings

45
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:10,642
19 And they shall come, and shall rest all of them

46
00:00:10,642 --> 00:00:13,309
 in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the

47
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:15,976
 rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all bushes

48
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,949
20 In the same day shall the Lord shave with a

49
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:19,949
 razor that is hired, by them beyond the river, by the

50
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:21,949
 king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the

51
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:23,949
 feet; and it shall also consume the beard

52
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:27,924
21 And it shall come to pass in that day, a man

53
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:31,924
 shall nourish a young cow and two sheep

54
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:55,899
22 And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of

55
00:00:55,899 --> 00:01:19,899
 milk they shall give he shall eat butter; for

56
00:01:19,899 --> 00:01:43,899
 butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in

57
00:01:43,899 --> 00:02:07,899
 the land

58
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:33,594
23 And it shall come to pass in that day, every

59
00:02:33,594 --> 00:02:59,594
 place shall be, where there were a thousand vines at

60
00:02:59,594 --> 00:03:25,594
 a thousand silverlings, which shall be for briers

61
00:03:25,594 --> 00:03:51,594
 and thorns

62
00:03:51,264 --> 00:04:07,264
24 With arrows and with bows shall men come

63
00:04:07,264 --> 00:04:23,264
 thither, because all the land shall become briers and

64
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:39,264
 thorns

65
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:39,112
25 And all hills that shall be digged with the

66
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:39,112
 mattock, there shall not come thither the fear of

67
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:39,112
 briers and thorns; but it shall be for the sending

68
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:39,112
 forth of oxen, and the treading of lesser cattle.
