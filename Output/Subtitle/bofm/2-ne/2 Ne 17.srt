00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 17 Ephraim and Syria wage war

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
against Judah—Christ will be born of a

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:10:09,
virgin—Compare 
Isaiah 7. About 559–545 B.C. 

4
00:10:09,0 --> 00:10:09,0
1 And it came to pass in the days

5
00:10:09,0 --> 00:10:09,0
of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son

6
00:10:09,0 --> 00:10:09,0
of Uzziah, king of Judah, that

7
00:10:09,0 --> 00:10:09,0
Rezin, king of Syria, and Pekah the son

8
00:10:09,0 --> 00:10:09,0
of Remaliah, king of Israel, went

9
00:10:09,0 --> 00:10:09,0
up toward Jerusalem to war against

10
00:10:09,0 --> 00:09:41,
it, but could not prevail against it.

11
00:09:41,0 --> 00:09:41,0
2 And it was told the house of

12
00:09:41,0 --> 00:09:41,0
David, saying: Syria is

13
00:09:41,0 --> 00:09:41,0
confederate with Ephraim. And his

14
00:09:41,0 --> 00:09:41,0
heart was moved, and the heart

15
00:09:41,0 --> 00:09:41,0
of his people, as the trees of

16
00:09:41,0 --> 00:10:53,
the wood are moved with the wind.

17
00:10:53,0 --> 00:10:53,0
3 Then said the Lord unto

18
00:10:53,0 --> 00:10:53,0
Isaiah: Go forth now to meet

19
00:10:53,0 --> 00:10:53,0
Ahaz, thou and Shearjashub

20
00:10:53,0 --> 00:10:53,0
thy son, at the end of the

21
00:10:53,0 --> 00:10:53,0
conduit of the upper pool in

22
00:10:53,0 --> 00:18:37,
the highway of the fuller’s field;

23
00:18:37,0 --> 00:18:37,0
4 And say unto him: Take

24
00:18:37,0 --> 00:18:37,0
heed, and be quiet; fear not,

25
00:18:37,0 --> 00:18:37,0
neither be faint-hearted for

26
00:18:37,0 --> 00:18:37,0
the two tails of these

27
00:18:37,0 --> 00:18:37,0
smoking firebrands, for the

28
00:18:37,0 --> 00:18:37,0
fierce anger of Rezin with Syria,

29
00:18:37,0 --> 00:18:09,
and of the son of Remaliah.

30
00:18:09,0 --> 00:18:09,0
5 Because Syria,

31
00:18:09,0 --> 00:18:09,0
Ephraim, and the son of

32
00:18:09,0 --> 00:18:09,0
Remaliah, have taken evil

33
00:18:09,0 --> 00:17:41,
counsel against thee, saying:

34
00:17:41,0 --> 00:17:41,0
6 Let us go up against

35
00:17:41,0 --> 00:17:41,0
Judah and vex it, and

36
00:17:41,0 --> 00:17:41,0
let us make a breach

37
00:17:41,0 --> 00:17:41,0
therein for us, and set a

38
00:17:41,0 --> 00:17:41,0
king in the midst of

39
00:17:41,0 --> 00:17:13,
it, yea, the son of Tabeal.

40
00:17:13,0 --> 00:17:13,0
7 Thus saith the

41
00:17:13,0 --> 00:17:13,0
Lord God: It shall

42
00:17:13,0 --> 00:17:13,0
not stand, neither

43
00:17:13,0 --> 00:17:43,
shall it come to pass.

44
00:17:43,0 --> 00:17:43,0
8 For the head of

45
00:17:43,0 --> 00:17:43,0
Syria is

46
00:17:43,0 --> 00:17:43,0
Damascus, and the head

47
00:17:43,0 --> 00:17:43,0
of Damascus,

48
00:17:43,0 --> 00:17:43,0
Rezin; and within

49
00:17:43,0 --> 00:17:43,0
threescore and five

50
00:17:43,0 --> 00:17:43,0
years shall

51
00:17:43,0 --> 00:17:43,0
Ephraim be broken that

52
00:17:43,0 --> 00:17:15,
it be not a people.

53
00:17:15,0 --> 00:17:15,0
9 And the head

54
00:17:15,0 --> 00:17:15,0
of Ephraim is

55
00:17:15,0 --> 00:17:15,0
Samaria, and the

56
00:17:15,0 --> 00:17:15,0
head of

57
00:17:15,0 --> 00:17:15,0
Samaria is Remaliah’s

58
00:17:15,0 --> 00:17:15,0
son. If ye

59
00:17:15,0 --> 00:17:15,0
will not believe

60
00:17:15,0 --> 00:17:15,0
surely ye shall

61
00:17:15,0 --> 00:18:13,
not be established.

62
00:18:13,0 --> 00:18:13,0
10 Moreover,

63
00:18:13,0 --> 00:18:13,0
the Lord

64
00:18:13,0 --> 00:18:13,0
spake again unto

65
00:18:13,0 --> 00:17:45,
Ahaz, saying:

66
00:17:45,0 --> 00:17:45,0
11 Ask thee

67
00:17:45,0 --> 00:17:45,0
a sign of

68
00:17:45,0 --> 00:17:45,0
the Lord

69
00:17:45,0 --> 00:17:45,0
thy God; ask

70
00:17:45,0 --> 00:17:45,0
it either

71
00:17:45,0 --> 00:17:45,0
in the

72
00:17:45,0 --> 00:17:45,0
depths, or in

73
00:17:45,0 --> 00:17:17,
the heights above.

74
00:17:17,0 --> 00:17:17,0
12 But

75
00:17:17,0 --> 00:17:17,0
Ahaz said: I

76
00:17:17,0 --> 00:17:17,0
will not

77
00:17:17,0 --> 00:17:17,0
ask,

78
00:17:17,0 --> 00:17:17,0
neither will I

79
00:17:17,0 --> 00:16:49,
tempt the Lord.

80
00:16:49,0 --> 00:16:49,0
13 And he

81
00:16:49,0 --> 00:16:49,0
said:

82
00:16:49,0 --> 00:16:49,0
Hear ye

83
00:16:49,0 --> 00:16:49,0
now, O house

84
00:16:49,0 --> 00:16:49,0
of

85
00:16:49,0 --> 00:16:49,0
David; is it a

86
00:16:49,0 --> 00:16:49,0
small

87
00:16:49,0 --> 00:16:49,0
thing for

88
00:16:49,0 --> 00:16:49,0
you to

89
00:16:49,0 --> 00:16:49,0
weary men,

90
00:16:49,0 --> 00:16:49,0
but will

91
00:16:49,0 --> 00:18:33,
ye weary my God also?

92
00:18:33,0 --> 00:18:33,0
14

93
00:18:33,0 --> 00:18:33,0
Therefore,

94
00:18:33,0 --> 00:18:33,0
the Lord

95
00:18:33,0 --> 00:18:33,0
himself

96
00:18:33,0 --> 00:18:33,0
shall

97
00:18:33,0 --> 00:18:33,0
give you a

98
00:18:33,0 --> 00:18:33,0


99
00:18:33,0 --> 00:18:33,0
sign—Behold, a

100
00:18:33,0 --> 00:18:33,0
virgin

101
00:18:33,0 --> 00:18:33,0
shall

102
00:18:33,0 --> 00:18:33,0
conceive,

103
00:18:33,0 --> 00:18:33,0
and shall

104
00:18:33,0 --> 00:18:33,0
bear a

105
00:18:33,0 --> 00:18:33,0
son, and

106
00:18:33,0 --> 00:18:33,0
shall

107
00:18:33,0 --> 00:18:05,
call his name Immanuel.

108
00:18:05,0 --> 00:18:05,0
15

109
00:18:05,0 --> 00:18:05,0
Butter and

110
00:18:05,0 --> 00:18:05,0
honey

111
00:18:05,0 --> 00:18:05,0
shall he

112
00:18:05,0 --> 00:18:05,0
eat,

113
00:18:05,0 --> 00:18:05,0
that he

114
00:18:05,0 --> 00:18:05,0
may

115
00:18:05,0 --> 00:18:05,0
know to

116
00:18:05,0 --> 00:18:05,0
refuse

117
00:18:05,0 --> 00:18:05,0
the evil

118
00:18:05,0 --> 00:18:05,0
and to

119
00:18:05,0 --> 00:17:37,
choose the good.

120
00:17:37,0 --> 00:17:37,0
16 For

121
00:17:37,0 --> 00:17:37,0
before

122
00:17:37,0 --> 00:17:37,0
the

123
00:17:37,0 --> 00:17:37,0
child

124
00:17:37,0 --> 00:17:37,0
shall know

125
00:17:37,0 --> 00:17:37,0
to

126
00:17:37,0 --> 00:17:37,0
refuse the

127
00:17:37,0 --> 00:17:37,0
evil

128
00:17:37,0 --> 00:17:37,0
and

129
00:17:37,0 --> 00:17:37,0
choose the

130
00:17:37,0 --> 00:17:37,0
good,

131
00:17:37,0 --> 00:17:37,0
the land

132
00:17:37,0 --> 00:17:37,0
that

133
00:17:37,0 --> 00:17:37,0
thou

134
00:17:37,0 --> 00:17:37,0
abhorrest

135
00:17:37,0 --> 00:17:37,0
shall be

136
00:17:37,0 --> 00:17:37,0


137
00:17:37,0 --> 00:17:37,0
forsaken of

138
00:17:37,0 --> 00:17:37,0
both her

139
00:17:37,0 --> 00:17:09,
kings.

140
00:17:09,0 --> 00:17:09,0
17 The

141
00:17:09,0 --> 00:17:09,0
Lord

142
00:17:09,0 --> 00:17:09,0
shall

143
00:17:09,0 --> 00:17:09,0
bring

144
00:17:09,0 --> 00:17:09,0
upon

145
00:17:09,0 --> 00:17:09,0
thee,

146
00:17:09,0 --> 00:17:09,0
and

147
00:17:09,0 --> 00:17:09,0
upon thy

148
00:17:09,0 --> 00:17:09,0


149
00:17:09,0 --> 00:17:09,0
people, and

150
00:17:09,0 --> 00:17:09,0
upon

151
00:17:09,0 --> 00:17:09,0
thy

152
00:17:09,0 --> 00:17:09,0
father’s

153
00:17:09,0 --> 00:17:09,0
house,

154
00:17:09,0 --> 00:17:09,0
days

155
00:17:09,0 --> 00:17:09,0
that

156
00:17:09,0 --> 00:17:09,0
have

157
00:17:09,0 --> 00:17:09,0
not come

158
00:17:09,0 --> 00:17:09,0
from

159
00:17:09,0 --> 00:17:09,0
the

160
00:17:09,0 --> 00:17:09,0
day that

161
00:17:09,0 --> 00:17:09,0


162
00:17:09,0 --> 00:17:09,0
Ephraim

163
00:17:09,0 --> 00:17:09,0
departed

164
00:17:09,0 --> 00:17:09,0
from

165
00:17:09,0 --> 00:17:39,
Judah, the king of Assyria.

166
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
18

167
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
And it

168
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
shall

169
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
come

170
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
to

171
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
pass

172
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
in

173
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
that day

174
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
that

175
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
the

176
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
Lord

177
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
shall

178
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
hiss

179
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
for

180
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
the

181
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
fly

182
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
that is

183
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
in

184
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
the

186
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
uttermost

187
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
part of

00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0


189
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
Egypt,

190
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
and for

00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
bee

193
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:11,
that is in the land of Assyria.

194
00:17:11,0 --> 00:17:11,0
19

195
00:17:11,0 --> 00:17:11,0
And

196
00:17:11,0 --> 00:17:11,0
they

197
00:17:11,0 --> 00:17:11,0


198
00:17:11,0 --> 00:17:11,0
shall

199
00:17:11,0 --> 00:17:11,0
come,

200
00:17:11,0 --> 00:17:11,0

201
00:17:11,0 --> 00:17:11,0


202
00:17:11,0 --> 00:17:11,0

203
00:17:11,0 --> 00:17:11,0
rest

204
00:17:11,0 --> 00:17:11,0

00:17:11,0 --> 00:17:11,0


212
00:17:11,0 --> 00:17:11,0
valleys,
