00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:03,333
Chapter 17 Ephraim and Syria wage war

2
00:00:03,333 --> 00:00:06,666
against Judah—Christ will be born of a

3
00:00:06,666 --> 00:00:10,377
virgin—Compare 
Isaiah 7. About 559–545 B.C. 

4
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:14,091
1 And it came to pass in the days

5
00:00:14,091 --> 00:00:17,805
of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son

6
00:00:17,805 --> 00:00:21,519
of Uzziah, king of Judah, that

7
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:25,233
Rezin, king of Syria, and Pekah the son

8
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:28,947
of Remaliah, king of Israel, went

9
00:00:28,947 --> 00:00:32,661
up toward Jerusalem to war against

10
00:00:32,661 --> 00:00:36,703
it, but could not prevail against it.

11
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:36,536
2 And it was told the house of

12
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:36,369
David, saying: Syria is

13
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:36,202
confederate with Ephraim. And his

14
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:36,035
heart was moved, and the heart

15
00:00:36,035 --> 00:00:35,868
of his people, as the trees of

16
00:00:35,868 --> 00:00:35,769
the wood are moved with the wind.

17
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:35,602
3 Then said the Lord unto

18
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:35,435
Isaiah: Go forth now to meet

19
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:35,268
Ahaz, thou and Shearjashub

20
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:35,101
thy son, at the end of the

21
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:34,934
conduit of the upper pool in

22
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:34,835
the highway of the fuller’s field;

23
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:35,121
4 And say unto him: Take

24
00:00:35,121 --> 00:00:35,407
heed, and be quiet; fear not,

25
00:00:35,407 --> 00:00:35,693
neither be faint-hearted for

26
00:00:35,693 --> 00:00:35,979
the two tails of these

27
00:00:35,979 --> 00:00:36,265
smoking firebrands, for the

28
00:00:36,265 --> 00:00:36,551
fierce anger of Rezin with Syria,

29
00:00:36,551 --> 00:00:36,303
and of the son of Remaliah.

30
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:36,053
5 Because Syria,

31
00:00:36,053 --> 00:00:35,803
Ephraim, and the son of

32
00:00:35,803 --> 00:00:35,553
Remaliah, have taken evil

33
00:00:35,553 --> 00:00:35,369
counsel against thee, saying:

34
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:35,202
6 Let us go up against

35
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:35,035
Judah and vex it, and

36
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:34,868
let us make a breach

37
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:34,701
therein for us, and set a

38
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:34,534
king in the midst of

39
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:34,434
it, yea, the son of Tabeal.

40
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:34,434
7 Thus saith the

41
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:34,434
Lord God: It shall

42
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:34,434
not stand, neither

43
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:34,902
shall it come to pass.

44
00:00:34,902 --> 00:00:35,124
8 For the head of

45
00:00:35,124 --> 00:00:35,346
Syria is

46
00:00:35,346 --> 00:00:35,568
Damascus, and the head

47
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:35,79
of Damascus,

48
00:00:35,79 --> 00:00:36,012
Rezin; and within

49
00:00:36,012 --> 00:00:36,234
threescore and five

50
00:00:36,234 --> 00:00:36,456
years shall

51
00:00:36,456 --> 00:00:36,678
Ephraim be broken that

52
00:00:36,678 --> 00:00:36,37
it be not a people.

53
00:00:36,37 --> 00:00:36,259
9 And the head

54
00:00:36,259 --> 00:00:36,148
of Ephraim is

55
00:00:36,148 --> 00:00:36,037
Samaria, and the

56
00:00:36,037 --> 00:00:35,926
head of

57
00:00:35,926 --> 00:00:35,815
Samaria is Remaliah’s

58
00:00:35,815 --> 00:00:35,704
son. If ye

59
00:00:35,704 --> 00:00:35,593
will not believe

60
00:00:35,593 --> 00:00:35,482
surely ye shall

61
00:00:35,482 --> 00:00:35,435
not be established.

62
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:35,185
10 Moreover,

63
00:00:35,185 --> 00:00:34,935
the Lord

64
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:34,685
spake again unto

65
00:00:34,685 --> 00:00:34,501
Ahaz, saying:

66
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:34,501
11 Ask thee

67
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:34,501
a sign of

68
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:34,501
the Lord

69
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:34,501
thy God; ask

70
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:34,501
it either

71
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:34,501
in the

72
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:34,501
depths, or in

73
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:34,968
the heights above.

74
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:34,968
12 But

75
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:34,968
Ahaz said: I

76
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:34,968
will not

77
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:34,968
ask,

78
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:34,968
neither will I

79
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:34,034
tempt the Lord.

80
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:34,117
13 And he

81
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:34,2
said:

82
00:00:34,2 --> 00:00:34,283
Hear ye

83
00:00:34,283 --> 00:00:34,366
now, O house

84
00:00:34,366 --> 00:00:34,449
of

85
00:00:34,449 --> 00:00:34,532
David; is it a

86
00:00:34,532 --> 00:00:34,615
small

87
00:00:34,615 --> 00:00:34,698
thing for

88
00:00:34,698 --> 00:00:34,781
you to

89
00:00:34,781 --> 00:00:34,864
weary men,

90
00:00:34,864 --> 00:00:34,947
but will

91
00:00:34,947 --> 00:00:35,035
ye weary my God also?

92
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:35,097
14

93
00:00:35,097 --> 00:00:35,159
Therefore,

94
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:35,221
the Lord

95
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:35,283
himself

96
00:00:35,283 --> 00:00:35,345
shall

97
00:00:35,345 --> 00:00:35,407
give you a

98
00:00:35,407 --> 00:00:35,469


99
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,531
sign—Behold, a

100
00:00:35,531 --> 00:00:35,593
virgin

101
00:00:35,593 --> 00:00:35,655
shall

102
00:00:35,655 --> 00:00:35,717
conceive,

103
00:00:35,717 --> 00:00:35,779
and shall

104
00:00:35,779 --> 00:00:35,841
bear a

105
00:00:35,841 --> 00:00:35,903
son, and

106
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:35,965
shall

107
00:00:35,965 --> 00:00:36,97
call his name Immanuel.

108
00:00:36,97 --> 00:00:36,97
15

109
00:00:36,97 --> 00:00:36,97
Butter and

110
00:00:36,97 --> 00:00:36,97
honey

111
00:00:36,97 --> 00:00:36,97
shall he

112
00:00:36,97 --> 00:00:36,97
eat,

113
00:00:36,97 --> 00:00:36,97
that he

114
00:00:36,97 --> 00:00:36,97
may

115
00:00:36,97 --> 00:00:36,97
know to

116
00:00:36,97 --> 00:00:36,97
refuse

117
00:00:36,97 --> 00:00:36,97
the evil

118
00:00:36,97 --> 00:00:36,97
and to

119
00:00:36,97 --> 00:00:36,036
choose the good.

120
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:35,986
16 For

121
00:00:35,986 --> 00:00:35,936
before

122
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:35,886
the

123
00:00:35,886 --> 00:00:35,836
child

124
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:35,786
shall know

125
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:35,736
to

126
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:35,686
refuse the

127
00:00:35,686 --> 00:00:35,636
evil

128
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:35,586
and

129
00:00:35,586 --> 00:00:35,536
choose the

130
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:35,486
good,

131
00:00:35,486 --> 00:00:35,436
the land

132
00:00:35,436 --> 00:00:35,386
that

133
00:00:35,386 --> 00:00:35,336
thou

134
00:00:35,336 --> 00:00:35,286
abhorrest

135
00:00:35,286 --> 00:00:35,236
shall be

136
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:35,186


137
00:00:35,186 --> 00:00:35,136
forsaken of

138
00:00:35,136 --> 00:00:35,086
both her

139
00:00:35,086 --> 00:00:35,102
kings.

140
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:35,102
17 The

141
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:35,102
Lord

142
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:35,102
shall

143
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:35,102
bring

144
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:35,102

145
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:35,102
thee,

146
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:35,102
and

147
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:35,102
upon thy

149
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:35,102
people, and

00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:35,102
thy

father’s

153
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:35,102
house,

154
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:35,102
days

155
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:35,102

00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:35,102
have

157
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:35,102

158
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:35,102
from

00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:35,102
the

00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:35,102
day that

00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:35,102


162
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:35,102
Ephraim

163
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:35,102
departed

164
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:35,102
from

165
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:35,102
Judah, the king of Assyria.

166
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:35,102
18

167
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:35,102
And it

168
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:35,102
shall

169
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:35,102

pass

172
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:35,102
in

173
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:35,102
that day

174
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:35,102
that

00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:35,102
the

00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:35,102
Lord

177
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:35,102
shall

182
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:35,102
that is

183
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:35,102

184
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:35,102

195
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:35,102
And
