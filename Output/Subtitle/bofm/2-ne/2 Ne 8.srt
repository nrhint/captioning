00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:48,0
Isaiah 51 and 52:1–2. About 559–545 B.C.

2
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:55,248
1 Hearken unto me, ye that follow after

3
00:00:55,248 --> 00:01:02,248
 righteousness. Look unto the rock from whence ye are hewn,

4
00:01:02,248 --> 00:01:09,248
 and to the hole of the pit from whence ye are

5
00:01:09,248 --> 00:01:16,248
 digged

6
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:24,244
2 Look unto Abraham, your father, and unto Sarah,

7
00:01:24,244 --> 00:01:31,911
 she that bare you; for I called him alone, and

8
00:01:31,911 --> 00:01:39,578
 blessed him

9
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:48,799
3 For the Lord shall comfort Zion, he will comfort

10
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:58,399
 all her waste places; and he will make her

11
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:07,999
 wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of

12
00:02:07,999 --> 00:02:17,599
 the Lord. Joy and gladness shall be found therein,

13
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:27,199
 thanksgiving and the voice of melody

14
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:33,797
4 Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto

15
00:02:33,797 --> 00:02:40,547
 me, O my nation; for a law shall proceed from me,

16
00:02:40,547 --> 00:02:47,297
 and I will make my judgment to rest for a light for

17
00:02:47,297 --> 00:02:54,047
 the people

18
00:02:54,007 --> 00:03:00,257
5 My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone

19
00:03:00,257 --> 00:03:06,507
 forth, and mine arm shall judge the people. The

20
00:03:06,507 --> 00:03:12,757
 isles shall wait upon me, and on mine arm shall they

21
00:03:12,757 --> 00:03:19,007
 trust

22
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:28,099
6 Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon

23
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:36,432
 the earth beneath; for the heavens shall vanish

24
00:03:36,432 --> 00:03:44,765
 away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a

25
00:03:44,765 --> 00:03:53,098
 garment; and they that dwell therein shall die in

26
00:03:53,098 --> 00:04:01,431
 like manner. But my salvation shall be forever,

27
00:04:01,431 --> 00:04:09,764
 and my righteousness shall not be abolished

28
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:17,166
7 Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the

29
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:24,916
 people in whose heart I have written my law, fear

30
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:32,666
 ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid

31
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:40,416
 of their revilings

32
00:04:40,18 --> 00:04:47,43
8 For the moth shall eat them up like a garment,

33
00:04:47,43 --> 00:04:54,68
 and the worm shall eat them like wool. But my

34
00:04:54,68 --> 00:05:01,93
 righteousness shall be forever, and my salvation from

35
00:05:01,93 --> 00:05:09,18
 generation to generation

36
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:17,509
9 Awake, awake! Put on strength, O arm of the

37
00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:25,842
 Lord; awake as in the ancient days. Art thou not he

38
00:05:25,842 --> 00:05:34,175
 that hath cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon

39
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:43,401
10 Art thou not he who hath dried the sea, the

40
00:05:43,401 --> 00:05:52,068
 waters of the great deep; that hath made the depths

41
00:05:52,068 --> 00:06:00,735
 of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over

42
00:06:00,06 --> 00:06:06,66
11 Therefore, the redeemed of the Lord shall

43
00:06:06,66 --> 00:06:13,26
 return, and come with singing unto Zion; and

44
00:06:13,26 --> 00:06:19,86
 everlasting joy and holiness shall be upon their heads; and

45
00:06:19,86 --> 00:06:26,46
 they shall obtain gladness and joy; sorrow and

46
00:06:26,46 --> 00:06:33,06
 mourning shall flee away

47
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:40,809
12 I am he; yea, I am he that comforteth you.

48
00:06:40,809 --> 00:06:48,559
 Behold, who art thou, that thou shouldst be afraid of

49
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:56,309
 man, who shall die, and of the son of man, who

50
00:06:56,309 --> 00:07:04,059
 shall be made like unto grass

51
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:10,958
13 And forgettest the Lord thy maker, that hath

52
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:16,958
 stretched forth the heavens, and laid the

53
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:22,958
 foundations of the earth, and hast feared continually every

54
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:28,958
 day, because of the fury of the oppressor, as if

55
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:34,958
 he were ready to destroy? And where is the fury of

56
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:40,958
 the oppressor

57
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:47,96
14 The captive exile hasteneth, that he may be

58
00:07:47,96 --> 00:07:55,293
 loosed, and that he should not die in the pit, nor

59
00:07:55,293 --> 00:08:02,626
 that his bread should fail

60
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:11,182
15 But I am the Lord thy God, whose waves roared;

61
00:08:11,182 --> 00:08:19,682
 the Lord of Hosts is my name

62
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:26,166
16 And I have put my words in thy mouth, and have

63
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:32,566
 covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I

64
00:08:32,566 --> 00:08:38,966
 may plant the heavens and lay the foundations of the

65
00:08:38,966 --> 00:08:45,366
 earth, and say unto Zion: Behold, thou art my

66
00:08:45,366 --> 00:08:51,766
 people

67
00:08:51,664 --> 00:09:00,414
17 Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast

68
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:09,164
 drunk at the hand of the Lord the cup of his

69
00:09:09,164 --> 00:09:17,914
 fury—thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of

70
00:09:17,914 --> 00:09:26,664
 trembling wrung out

71
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:32,899
18 And none to guide her among all the sons she

72
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:39,566
 hath brought forth; neither that taketh her by the

73
00:09:39,566 --> 00:09:46,233
 hand, of all the sons she hath brought up

74
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:52,786
19 These two sons are come unto thee, who shall be

75
00:09:52,786 --> 00:09:58,786
 sorry for thee—thy desolation and destruction,

76
00:09:58,786 --> 00:10:04,786
 and the famine and the sword—and by whom shall I

77
00:10:04,786 --> 00:10:10,786
 comfort thee

78
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:17,993
20 Thy sons have fainted, save these two; they lie

79
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:25,743
 at the head of all the streets; as a wild bull in

80
00:10:25,743 --> 00:10:33,493
 a net, they are full of the fury of the Lord, the

81
00:10:33,493 --> 00:10:41,243
 rebuke of thy God

82
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:49,174
21 Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and

83
00:10:49,174 --> 00:10:56,674
 drunken, and not with wine

84
00:10:56,923 --> 00:11:04,323
22 Thus saith thy Lord, the Lord and thy God

85
00:11:04,323 --> 00:11:11,723
 pleadeth the cause of his people; behold, I have taken

86
00:11:11,723 --> 00:11:19,123
 out of thine hand the cup of trembling, the dregs

87
00:11:19,123 --> 00:11:26,523
 of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it

88
00:11:26,523 --> 00:11:33,923
 again

89
00:11:33,86 --> 00:11:41,46
23 But I will put it into the hand of them that

90
00:11:41,46 --> 00:11:49,06
 afflict thee; who have said to thy soul: Bow down,

91
00:11:49,06 --> 00:11:56,66
 that we may go over—and thou hast laid thy body as

92
00:11:56,66 --> 00:12:04,26
 the ground and as the street to them that went

93
00:12:04,26 --> 00:12:11,86
 over

94
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:18,597
24 Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O Zion; put

95
00:12:18,597 --> 00:12:26,097
 on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy

96
00:12:26,097 --> 00:12:33,597
 city; for henceforth there shall no more come into

97
00:12:33,597 --> 00:12:41,097
 thee the uncircumcised and the unclean
