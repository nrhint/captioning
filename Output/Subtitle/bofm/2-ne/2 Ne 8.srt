1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:10:39,
Isaiah 51 and 52:1–2. About 559–545 B.C. 

2
00:10:39,0 --> 00:10:39,0
1 Hearken unto me, ye that follow

3
00:10:39,0 --> 00:10:39,0
after righteousness. Look unto the rock

4
00:10:39,0 --> 00:10:39,0
from whence ye are hewn, and to the hole

5
00:10:39,0 --> 00:11:37,
of the pit from whence ye are digged.

6
00:11:37,0 --> 00:11:37,0
2 Look unto Abraham, your father,

7
00:11:37,0 --> 00:11:37,0
and unto Sarah, she that bare you; for

8
00:11:37,0 --> 00:11:09,
I called him alone, and blessed him.

9
00:11:09,0 --> 00:11:09,0
3 For the Lord shall comfort Zion,

10
00:11:09,0 --> 00:11:09,0
he will comfort all her waste

11
00:11:09,0 --> 00:11:09,0
places; and he will make her

12
00:11:09,0 --> 00:11:09,0
wilderness like Eden, and her desert like

13
00:11:09,0 --> 00:11:09,0
the garden of the Lord. Joy and

14
00:11:09,0 --> 00:11:09,0
gladness shall be found therein,

15
00:11:09,0 --> 00:21:34,
thanksgiving and the voice of melody.

16
00:21:34,0 --> 00:21:34,0
4 Hearken unto me, my people;

17
00:21:34,0 --> 00:21:34,0
and give ear unto me, O my nation;

18
00:21:34,0 --> 00:21:34,0
for a law shall proceed from

19
00:21:34,0 --> 00:21:34,0
me, and I will make my judgment to

20
00:21:34,0 --> 00:21:06,
rest for a light for the people.

21
00:21:06,0 --> 00:21:06,0
5 My righteousness is near; my

22
00:21:06,0 --> 00:21:06,0
salvation is gone forth, and

23
00:21:06,0 --> 00:21:06,0
mine arm shall judge the people.

24
00:21:06,0 --> 00:21:06,0
The isles shall wait upon me,

25
00:21:06,0 --> 00:20:38,
and on mine arm shall they trust.

26
00:20:38,0 --> 00:20:38,0
6 Lift up your eyes to the

27
00:20:38,0 --> 00:20:38,0
heavens, and look upon the

28
00:20:38,0 --> 00:20:38,0
earth beneath; for the heavens

29
00:20:38,0 --> 00:20:38,0
shall vanish away like smoke,

30
00:20:38,0 --> 00:20:38,0
and the earth shall wax old

31
00:20:38,0 --> 00:20:38,0
like a garment; and they that

32
00:20:38,0 --> 00:20:38,0
dwell therein shall die in

33
00:20:38,0 --> 00:20:38,0
like manner. But my salvation

34
00:20:38,0 --> 00:20:38,0
shall be forever, and my

35
00:20:38,0 --> 00:20:52,
righteousness shall not be abolished.

36
00:20:52,0 --> 00:20:52,0
7 Hearken unto me, ye that

37
00:20:52,0 --> 00:20:52,0
know righteousness, the

38
00:20:52,0 --> 00:20:52,0
people in whose heart I have

39
00:20:52,0 --> 00:20:52,0
written my law, fear ye not the

40
00:20:52,0 --> 00:20:52,0
reproach of men, neither be

41
00:20:52,0 --> 00:22:04,
ye afraid of their revilings.

42
00:22:04,0 --> 00:22:04,0
8 For the moth shall eat

43
00:22:04,0 --> 00:22:04,0
them up like a garment,

44
00:22:04,0 --> 00:22:04,0
and the worm shall eat

45
00:22:04,0 --> 00:22:04,0
them like wool. But my

46
00:22:04,0 --> 00:22:04,0
righteousness shall be

47
00:22:04,0 --> 00:22:04,0
forever, and my salvation

48
00:22:04,0 --> 00:21:36,
from generation to generation.

49
00:21:36,0 --> 00:21:36,0
9 Awake, awake! Put on

50
00:21:36,0 --> 00:21:36,0
strength, O arm of the

51
00:21:36,0 --> 00:21:36,0
Lord; awake as in the

52
00:21:36,0 --> 00:21:36,0
ancient days. Art thou

53
00:21:36,0 --> 00:21:36,0
not he that hath cut

54
00:21:36,0 --> 00:21:08,
Rahab, and wounded the dragon?

55
00:21:08,0 --> 00:21:08,0
10 Art thou not he

56
00:21:08,0 --> 00:21:08,0
who hath dried the

57
00:21:08,0 --> 00:21:08,0
sea, the waters of the

58
00:21:08,0 --> 00:21:08,0
great deep; that

59
00:21:08,0 --> 00:21:08,0
hath made the depths

60
00:21:08,0 --> 00:21:08,0
of the sea a way for

61
00:21:08,0 --> 00:20:40,
the ransomed to pass over?

62
00:20:40,0 --> 00:20:40,0
11 Therefore, the

63
00:20:40,0 --> 00:20:40,0
redeemed of the

64
00:20:40,0 --> 00:20:40,0
Lord shall return,

65
00:20:40,0 --> 00:20:40,0
and come with

66
00:20:40,0 --> 00:20:40,0
singing unto Zion; and

67
00:20:40,0 --> 00:20:40,0
everlasting joy

68
00:20:40,0 --> 00:20:40,0
and holiness shall

69
00:20:40,0 --> 00:20:40,0
be upon their

70
00:20:40,0 --> 00:20:40,0
heads; and they shall

71
00:20:40,0 --> 00:20:40,0
obtain gladness and

72
00:20:40,0 --> 00:20:40,0
joy; sorrow and

73
00:20:40,0 --> 00:22:10,
mourning shall flee away.

74
00:22:10,0 --> 00:22:10,0
12 I am he; yea,

75
00:22:10,0 --> 00:22:10,0
I am he that

76
00:22:10,0 --> 00:22:10,0
comforteth you.

77
00:22:10,0 --> 00:22:10,0
Behold, who art thou,

78
00:22:10,0 --> 00:22:10,0
that thou

79
00:22:10,0 --> 00:22:10,0
shouldst be afraid of

80
00:22:10,0 --> 00:22:10,0
man, who shall die,

81
00:22:10,0 --> 00:22:10,0
and of the son

82
00:22:10,0 --> 00:22:10,0
of man, who shall

83
00:22:10,0 --> 00:21:42,
be made like unto grass?

84
00:21:42,0 --> 00:21:42,0
13 And

85
00:21:42,0 --> 00:21:42,0
forgettest the Lord thy

86
00:21:42,0 --> 00:21:42,0
maker, that hath

87
00:21:42,0 --> 00:21:42,0
stretched forth

88
00:21:42,0 --> 00:21:42,0
the heavens, and

89
00:21:42,0 --> 00:21:42,0
laid the

90
00:21:42,0 --> 00:21:42,0
foundations of the

91
00:21:42,0 --> 00:21:42,0
earth, and hast

92
00:21:42,0 --> 00:21:42,0
feared continually

93
00:21:42,0 --> 00:21:42,0
every day,

94
00:21:42,0 --> 00:21:42,0
because of the fury

95
00:21:42,0 --> 00:21:42,0
of the oppressor,

96
00:21:42,0 --> 00:21:42,0
as if he were

97
00:21:42,0 --> 00:21:42,0
ready to destroy?

98
00:21:42,0 --> 00:21:42,0
And where is

99
00:21:42,0 --> 00:21:14,
the fury of the oppressor?

100
00:21:14,0 --> 00:21:14,0
14 The captive

101
00:21:14,0 --> 00:21:14,0
exile

102
00:21:14,0 --> 00:21:14,0
hasteneth, that he may

103
00:21:14,0 --> 00:21:14,0
be loosed, and

104
00:21:14,0 --> 00:21:14,0
that he should

105
00:21:14,0 --> 00:21:14,0
not die in the

106
00:21:14,0 --> 00:21:14,0
pit, nor that

107
00:21:14,0 --> 00:20:46,
his bread should fail.

108
00:20:46,0 --> 00:20:46,0
15 But I am

109
00:20:46,0 --> 00:20:46,0
the Lord thy

110
00:20:46,0 --> 00:20:46,0
God, whose

111
00:20:46,0 --> 00:20:46,0
waves roared;

112
00:20:46,0 --> 00:20:46,0
the Lord of

113
00:20:46,0 --> 00:21:30,
Hosts is my name.

114
00:21:30,0 --> 00:21:30,0
16 And I

115
00:21:30,0 --> 00:21:30,0
have put my

116
00:21:30,0 --> 00:21:30,0
words in thy

117
00:21:30,0 --> 00:21:30,0
mouth, and

118
00:21:30,0 --> 00:21:30,0
have covered

119
00:21:30,0 --> 00:21:30,0
thee in the

120
00:21:30,0 --> 00:21:30,0
shadow of mine

121
00:21:30,0 --> 00:21:30,0
hand, that

122
00:21:30,0 --> 00:21:30,0
I may plant

123
00:21:30,0 --> 00:21:30,0
the heavens

124
00:21:30,0 --> 00:21:30,0
and lay the

125
00:21:30,0 --> 00:21:30,0
foundations

126
00:21:30,0 --> 00:21:30,0
of the

127
00:21:30,0 --> 00:21:30,0
earth, and say

128
00:21:30,0 --> 00:21:30,0
unto Zion:

129
00:21:30,0 --> 00:21:02,
Behold, thou art my people.

130
00:21:02,0 --> 00:21:02,0
17 Awake,

131
00:21:02,0 --> 00:21:02,0
awake, stand

132
00:21:02,0 --> 00:21:02,0
up, O

133
00:21:02,0 --> 00:21:02,0
Jerusalem,

134
00:21:02,0 --> 00:21:02,0
which hast

135
00:21:02,0 --> 00:21:02,0
drunk at the

136
00:21:02,0 --> 00:21:02,0
hand of the

137
00:21:02,0 --> 00:21:02,0
Lord the cup

138
00:21:02,0 --> 00:21:02,0
of his

139
00:21:02,0 --> 00:21:02,0
fury—thou hast

140
00:21:02,0 --> 00:21:02,0
drunken

141
00:21:02,0 --> 00:21:02,0
the dregs of

142
00:21:02,0 --> 00:21:02,0
the cup of

143
00:21:02,0 --> 00:20:48,
trembling wrung out—

144
00:20:48,0 --> 00:20:48,0
18 And

145
00:20:48,0 --> 00:20:48,0
none to guide

146
00:20:48,0 --> 00:20:48,0
her among

147
00:20:48,0 --> 00:20:48,0
all the

148
00:20:48,0 --> 00:20:48,0
sons she

149
00:20:48,0 --> 00:20:48,0
hath brought

150
00:20:48,0 --> 00:20:48,0
forth;

151
00:20:48,0 --> 00:20:48,0
neither that

152
00:20:48,0 --> 00:20:48,0
taketh

153
00:20:48,0 --> 00:20:48,0
her by the

154
00:20:48,0 --> 00:20:48,0
hand, of

155
00:20:48,0 --> 00:20:48,0
all the sons

156
00:20:48,0 --> 00:22:18,
she hath brought up.

157
00:22:18,0 --> 00:22:18,0
19 These

158
00:22:18,0 --> 00:22:18,0
two sons

159
00:22:18,0 --> 00:22:18,0
are come

160
00:22:18,0 --> 00:22:18,0
unto thee,

161
00:22:18,0 --> 00:22:18,0
who shall be

162
00:22:18,0 --> 00:22:18,0
sorry for

163
00:22:18,0 --> 00:22:18,0
thee—thy

164
00:22:18,0 --> 00:22:18,0
desolation

165
00:22:18,0 --> 00:22:18,0
and

166
00:22:18,0 --> 00:22:18,0
destruction,

167
00:22:18,0 --> 00:22:18,0
and the

168
00:22:18,0 --> 00:22:18,0
famine and the

169
00:22:18,0 --> 00:22:18,0
sword—and

170
00:22:18,0 --> 00:22:18,0
by whom

171
00:22:18,0 --> 00:22:18,0
shall I

172
00:22:18,0 --> 00:21:50,
comfort thee?

173
00:21:50,0 --> 00:21:50,0
20 Thy

174
00:21:50,0 --> 00:21:50,0
sons have

175
00:21:50,0 --> 00:21:50,0
fainted,

176
00:21:50,0 --> 00:21:50,0
save these

177
00:21:50,0 --> 00:21:50,0
two;

178
00:21:50,0 --> 00:21:50,0
they lie at

179
00:21:50,0 --> 00:21:50,0
the head

180
00:21:50,0 --> 00:21:50,0
of all

181
00:21:50,0 --> 00:21:50,0
the

182
00:21:50,0 --> 00:21:50,0
streets; as a

183
00:21:50,0 --> 00:21:50,0
wild bull

184
00:21:50,0 --> 00:21:50,0
in a net,

185
00:21:50,0 --> 00:21:50,0
they are

186
00:21:50,0 --> 00:21:50,0
full of

187
00:21:50,0 --> 00:21:50,0
the fury

188
00:21:50,0 --> 00:21:50,0
of the

189
00:21:50,0 --> 00:24:02,
Lord, the rebuke of thy God.

190
00:24:02,0 --> 00:24:02,0
21

191
00:24:02,0 --> 00:24:02,0
Therefore

192
00:24:02,0 --> 00:24:02,0
hear now

193
00:24:02,0 --> 00:24:02,0
this, thou

194
00:24:02,0 --> 00:24:02,0


195
00:24:02,0 --> 00:24:02,0
afflicted, and

196
00:24:02,0 --> 00:24:02,0
drunken,

197
00:24:02,0 --> 00:24:02,0
and not

198
00:24:02,0 --> 00:30:43,
with wine:

199
00:30:43,0 --> 00:30:43,0
22 Thus

200
00:30:43,0 --> 00:30:43,0
saith

201
00:30:43,0 --> 00:30:43,0
thy

202
00:30:43,0 --> 00:30:43,0
Lord, the

203
00:30:43,0 --> 00:30:43,0
Lord

204
00:30:43,0 --> 00:30:43,0
and thy

205
00:30:43,0 --> 00:30:43,0
God

206
00:30:43,0 --> 00:30:43,0
pleadeth

207
00:30:43,0 --> 00:30:43,0
the cause

208
00:30:43,0 --> 00:30:43,0
of his

209
00:30:43,0 --> 00:30:43,0


210
00:30:43,0 --> 00:30:43,0
people;

211
00:30:43,0 --> 00:30:43,0
behold, I

212
00:30:43,0 --> 00:30:43,0
have

213
00:30:43,0 --> 00:30:43,0
taken out

214
00:30:43,0 --> 00:30:43,0
of thine

215
00:30:43,0 --> 00:30:43,0
hand

216
00:30:43,0 --> 00:30:43,0
the cup

217
00:30:43,0 --> 00:30:43,0
of

218
00:30:43,0 --> 00:30:43,0
trembling,

219
00:30:43,0 --> 00:30:43,0
the

220
00:30:43,0 --> 00:30:43,0
dregs of

221
00:30:43,0 --> 00:30:43,0
the cup

222
00:30:43,0 --> 00:30:43,0
of my

223
00:30:43,0 --> 00:30:43,0
fury;
