1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:22,956
Isaiah 51 and 52:1–2. About 559–545 B.C. 

2
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:24,206
1 Hearken unto me, ye that follow

3
00:00:24,206 --> 00:00:25,456
after righteousness. Look unto the rock

4
00:00:25,456 --> 00:00:26,706
from whence ye are hewn, and to the hole

5
00:00:26,706 --> 00:00:27,361
of the pit from whence ye are digged.

6
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:28,361
2 Look unto Abraham, your father,

7
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,361
and unto Sarah, she that bare you; for

8
00:00:29,361 --> 00:00:30,831
I called him alone, and blessed him.

9
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:30,974
3 For the Lord shall comfort Zion,

10
00:00:30,974 --> 00:00:31,117
he will comfort all her waste

11
00:00:31,117 --> 00:00:31,26
places; and he will make her

12
00:00:31,26 --> 00:00:31,403
wilderness like Eden, and her desert like

13
00:00:31,403 --> 00:00:31,546
the garden of the Lord. Joy and

14
00:00:31,546 --> 00:00:31,689
gladness shall be found therein,

15
00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:31,298
thanksgiving and the voice of melody.

16
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:31,098
4 Hearken unto me, my people;

17
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:30,898
and give ear unto me, O my nation;

18
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:30,698
for a law shall proceed from

19
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:30,498
me, and I will make my judgment to

20
00:00:30,498 --> 00:00:30,831
rest for a light for the people.

21
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:31,031
5 My righteousness is near; my

22
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:31,231
salvation is gone forth, and

23
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:31,431
mine arm shall judge the people.

24
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:31,631
The isles shall wait upon me,

25
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:31,298
and on mine arm shall they trust.

26
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:31,198
6 Lift up your eyes to the

27
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:31,098
heavens, and look upon the

28
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:30,998
earth beneath; for the heavens

29
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:30,898
shall vanish away like smoke,

30
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:30,798
and the earth shall wax old

31
00:00:30,798 --> 00:00:30,698
like a garment; and they that

32
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:30,598
dwell therein shall die in

33
00:00:30,598 --> 00:00:30,498
like manner. But my salvation

34
00:00:30,498 --> 00:00:30,398
shall be forever, and my

35
00:00:30,398 --> 00:00:30,831
righteousness shall not be abolished.

36
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:30,998
7 Hearken unto me, ye that

37
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:31,165
know righteousness, the

38
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:31,332
people in whose heart I have

39
00:00:31,332 --> 00:00:31,499
written my law, fear ye not the

40
00:00:31,499 --> 00:00:31,666
reproach of men, neither be

41
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:31,298
ye afraid of their revilings.

42
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:31,155
8 For the moth shall eat

43
00:00:31,155 --> 00:00:31,012
them up like a garment,

44
00:00:31,012 --> 00:00:30,869
and the worm shall eat

45
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:30,726
them like wool. But my

46
00:00:30,726 --> 00:00:30,583
righteousness shall be

47
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:30,44
forever, and my salvation

48
00:00:30,44 --> 00:00:30,831
from generation to generation.

49
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:30,998
9 Awake, awake! Put on

50
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:31,165
strength, O arm of the

51
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:31,332
Lord; awake as in the

52
00:00:31,332 --> 00:00:31,499
ancient days. Art thou

53
00:00:31,499 --> 00:00:31,666
not he that hath cut

54
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:31,298
Rahab, and wounded the dragon?

55
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:31,155
10 Art thou not he

56
00:00:31,155 --> 00:00:31,012
who hath dried the

57
00:00:31,012 --> 00:00:30,869
sea, the waters of the

58
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:30,726
great deep; that

59
00:00:30,726 --> 00:00:30,583
hath made the depths

60
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:30,44
of the sea a way for

61
00:00:30,44 --> 00:00:30,831
the ransomed to pass over?

62
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:30,914
11 Therefore, the

63
00:00:30,914 --> 00:00:30,997
redeemed of the

64
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:31,08
Lord shall return,

65
00:00:31,08 --> 00:00:31,163
and come with

66
00:00:31,163 --> 00:00:31,246
singing unto Zion; and

67
00:00:31,246 --> 00:00:31,329
everlasting joy

68
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:31,412
and holiness shall

69
00:00:31,412 --> 00:00:31,495
be upon their

70
00:00:31,495 --> 00:00:31,578
heads; and they shall

71
00:00:31,578 --> 00:00:31,661
obtain gladness and

72
00:00:31,661 --> 00:00:31,744
joy; sorrow and

73
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:31,298
mourning shall flee away.

74
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:31,198
12 I am he; yea,

75
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:31,098
I am he that

76
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:30,998
comforteth you.

77
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:30,898
Behold, who art thou,

78
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:30,798
that thou

79
00:00:30,798 --> 00:00:30,698
shouldst be afraid of

80
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:30,598
man, who shall die,

81
00:00:30,598 --> 00:00:30,498
and of the son

82
00:00:30,498 --> 00:00:30,398
of man, who shall

83
00:00:30,398 --> 00:00:30,831
be made like unto grass?

84
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:30,893
13 And

85
00:00:30,893 --> 00:00:30,955
forgettest the Lord thy

86
00:00:30,955 --> 00:00:31,017
maker, that hath

87
00:00:31,017 --> 00:00:31,079
stretched forth

88
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:31,141
the heavens, and

89
00:00:31,141 --> 00:00:31,203
laid the

90
00:00:31,203 --> 00:00:31,265
foundations of the

91
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:31,327
earth, and hast

92
00:00:31,327 --> 00:00:31,389
feared continually

93
00:00:31,389 --> 00:00:31,451
every day,

94
00:00:31,451 --> 00:00:31,513
because of the fury

95
00:00:31,513 --> 00:00:31,575
of the oppressor,

96
00:00:31,575 --> 00:00:31,637
as if he were

97
00:00:31,637 --> 00:00:31,699
ready to destroy?

98
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:31,761
And where is

99
00:00:31,761 --> 00:00:31,298
the fury of the oppressor?

100
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:31,173
14 The captive

101
00:00:31,173 --> 00:00:31,048
exile

102
00:00:31,048 --> 00:00:30,923
hasteneth, that he may

103
00:00:30,923 --> 00:00:30,798
be loosed, and

104
00:00:30,798 --> 00:00:30,673
that he should

105
00:00:30,673 --> 00:00:30,548
not die in the

106
00:00:30,548 --> 00:00:30,423
pit, nor that

107
00:00:30,423 --> 00:00:30,831
his bread should fail.

108
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:30,998
15 But I am

109
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:31,165
the Lord thy

110
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:31,332
God, whose

111
00:00:31,332 --> 00:00:31,499
waves roared;

112
00:00:31,499 --> 00:00:31,666
the Lord of

113
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:31,298
Hosts is my name.

114
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:31,236
16 And I

115
00:00:31,236 --> 00:00:31,174
have put my

116
00:00:31,174 --> 00:00:31,112
words in thy

117
00:00:31,112 --> 00:00:31,05
mouth, and

118
00:00:31,05 --> 00:00:30,988
have covered

119
00:00:30,988 --> 00:00:30,926
thee in the

120
00:00:30,926 --> 00:00:30,864
shadow of mine

121
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:30,802
hand, that

122
00:00:30,802 --> 00:00:30,74
I may plant

123
00:00:30,74 --> 00:00:30,678
the heavens

124
00:00:30,678 --> 00:00:30,616
and lay the

125
00:00:30,616 --> 00:00:30,554
foundations

126
00:00:30,554 --> 00:00:30,492
of the

127
00:00:30,492 --> 00:00:30,43
earth, and say

128
00:00:30,43 --> 00:00:30,368
unto Zion:

129
00:00:30,368 --> 00:00:30,831
Behold, thou art my people.

130
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:30,902
17 Awake,

131
00:00:30,902 --> 00:00:30,973
awake, stand

132
00:00:30,973 --> 00:00:31,044
up, O

133
00:00:31,044 --> 00:00:31,115
Jerusalem,

134
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:31,186
which hast

135
00:00:31,186 --> 00:00:31,257
drunk at the

136
00:00:31,257 --> 00:00:31,328
hand of the

137
00:00:31,328 --> 00:00:31,399
Lord the cup

138
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:31,47
of his

139
00:00:31,47 --> 00:00:31,541
fury—thou hast

140
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:31,612
drunken

141
00:00:31,612 --> 00:00:31,683
the dregs of

142
00:00:31,683 --> 00:00:31,754
the cup of

143
00:00:31,754 --> 00:00:31,298
trembling wrung out—

144
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:31,221
18 And

145
00:00:31,221 --> 00:00:31,144
none to guide

146
00:00:31,144 --> 00:00:31,067
her among

147
00:00:31,067 --> 00:00:30,99
all the

148
00:00:30,99 --> 00:00:30,913
sons she

149
00:00:30,913 --> 00:00:30,836
hath brought

150
00:00:30,836 --> 00:00:30,759
forth;

151
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:30,682
neither that

152
00:00:30,682 --> 00:00:30,605
taketh

153
00:00:30,605 --> 00:00:30,528
her by the

154
00:00:30,528 --> 00:00:30,451
hand, of

155
00:00:30,451 --> 00:00:30,374
all the sons

156
00:00:30,374 --> 00:00:30,831
she hath brought up.

157
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:30,893
19 These

158
00:00:30,893 --> 00:00:30,955
two sons

159
00:00:30,955 --> 00:00:31,017
are come

160
00:00:31,017 --> 00:00:31,079
unto thee,

161
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:31,141
who shall be

162
00:00:31,141 --> 00:00:31,203
sorry for

163
00:00:31,203 --> 00:00:31,265
thee—thy

164
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:31,327
desolation

165
00:00:31,327 --> 00:00:31,389
and

166
00:00:31,389 --> 00:00:31,451
destruction,

167
00:00:31,451 --> 00:00:31,513
and the

168
00:00:31,513 --> 00:00:31,575
famine and the

169
00:00:31,575 --> 00:00:31,637
sword—and

170
00:00:31,637 --> 00:00:31,699
by whom

171
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:31,761
shall I

172
00:00:31,761 --> 00:00:31,298
comfort thee?

173
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:31,239
20 Thy

174
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:31,18
sons have

175
00:00:31,18 --> 00:00:31,121
fainted,

176
00:00:31,121 --> 00:00:31,062
save these

177
00:00:31,062 --> 00:00:31,003
two;

178
00:00:31,003 --> 00:00:30,944
they lie at

179
00:00:30,944 --> 00:00:30,885
the head

180
00:00:30,885 --> 00:00:30,826
of all

181
00:00:30,826 --> 00:00:30,767
the

182
00:00:30,767 --> 00:00:30,708
streets; as a

183
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:30,649
wild bull

184
00:00:30,649 --> 00:00:30,59
in a net,

185
00:00:30,59 --> 00:00:30,531
they are

186
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:30,472
full of

187
00:00:30,472 --> 00:00:30,413
the fury

188
00:00:30,413 --> 00:00:30,354
of the

189
00:00:30,354 --> 00:00:30,831
Lord, the rebuke of thy God.

190
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:30,942
21

191
00:00:30,942 --> 00:00:31,053
Therefore

192
00:00:31,053 --> 00:00:31,164
hear now

193
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:31,275
this, thou

194
00:00:31,275 --> 00:00:31,386


195
00:00:31,386 --> 00:00:31,497
afflicted, and

196
00:00:31,497 --> 00:00:31,608
drunken,

197
00:00:31,608 --> 00:00:31,719
and not

198
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:31,298
with wine:

199
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:31,26
22 Thus

200
00:00:31,26 --> 00:00:31,222
saith
