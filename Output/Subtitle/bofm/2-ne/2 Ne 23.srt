00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 23 The destruction of Babylon is

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
a type of the destruction at the Second

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Coming—It will be a day of wrath and

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
vengeance—Babylon (the world) will fall

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:07:09,
forever—Compare 
Isaiah 13. About 559–545 B.C. 

6
00:07:09,0 --> 00:07:09,0
1 The burden of Babylon, which

7
00:07:09,0 --> 00:07:23,
Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.

8
00:07:23,0 --> 00:07:23,0
2 Lift ye up a banner upon

9
00:07:23,0 --> 00:07:23,0
the high mountain, exalt

10
00:07:23,0 --> 00:07:23,0
the voice unto them, shake

11
00:07:23,0 --> 00:07:23,0
the hand, that they may go

12
00:07:23,0 --> 00:06:55,
into the gates of the nobles.

13
00:06:55,0 --> 00:06:55,0
3 I have commanded my

14
00:06:55,0 --> 00:06:55,0
sanctified ones, I have also

15
00:06:55,0 --> 00:06:55,0
called my mighty ones, for

16
00:06:55,0 --> 00:06:55,0
mine anger is not upon

17
00:06:55,0 --> 00:07:39,
them that rejoice in my highness.

18
00:07:39,0 --> 00:07:39,0
4 The noise of the

19
00:07:39,0 --> 00:07:39,0
multitude in the mountains

20
00:07:39,0 --> 00:07:39,0
like as of a great

21
00:07:39,0 --> 00:07:39,0
people, a tumultuous noise

22
00:07:39,0 --> 00:07:39,0
of the kingdoms of

23
00:07:39,0 --> 00:07:39,0
nations gathered together,

24
00:07:39,0 --> 00:07:39,0
the Lord of Hosts

25
00:07:39,0 --> 00:07:11,
mustereth the hosts of the battle.

26
00:07:11,0 --> 00:07:11,0
5 They come from a far

27
00:07:11,0 --> 00:07:11,0
country, from the end

28
00:07:11,0 --> 00:07:11,0
of heaven, yea, the

29
00:07:11,0 --> 00:07:11,0
Lord, and the weapons

30
00:07:11,0 --> 00:07:11,0
of his indignation, to

31
00:07:11,0 --> 00:12:54,
destroy the whole land.

32
00:12:54,0 --> 00:12:54,0
6 Howl ye, for the

33
00:12:54,0 --> 00:12:54,0
day of the Lord is

34
00:12:54,0 --> 00:12:54,0
at hand; it shall

35
00:12:54,0 --> 00:12:54,0
come as a

36
00:12:54,0 --> 00:21:05,
destruction from the Almighty.

37
00:21:05,0 --> 00:21:05,0
7 Therefore

38
00:21:05,0 --> 00:21:05,0
shall all hands be

39
00:21:05,0 --> 00:21:05,0
faint, every

40
00:21:05,0 --> 00:24:15,
man’s heart shall melt;

41
00:24:15,0 --> 00:24:15,0
8 And they

42
00:24:15,0 --> 00:24:15,0
shall be afraid;

43
00:24:15,0 --> 00:24:15,0
pangs and sorrows

44
00:24:15,0 --> 00:24:15,0
shall take

45
00:24:15,0 --> 00:24:15,0
hold of them; they

46
00:24:15,0 --> 00:24:15,0
shall be

47
00:24:15,0 --> 00:24:15,0
amazed one at

48
00:24:15,0 --> 00:24:15,0
another; their faces

49
00:24:15,0 --> 00:24:45,
shall be as flames.

50
00:24:45,0 --> 00:24:45,0
9 Behold, the

51
00:24:45,0 --> 00:24:45,0
day of the

52
00:24:45,0 --> 00:24:45,0
Lord cometh,

53
00:24:45,0 --> 00:24:45,0
cruel both with

54
00:24:45,0 --> 00:24:45,0
wrath and fierce

55
00:24:45,0 --> 00:24:45,0
anger, to lay

56
00:24:45,0 --> 00:24:45,0
the land

57
00:24:45,0 --> 00:24:45,0
desolate; and he

58
00:24:45,0 --> 00:24:45,0
shall destroy

59
00:24:45,0 --> 00:24:45,0
the sinners

60
00:24:45,0 --> 00:24:17,
thereof out of it.

61
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
10 For the

62
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
stars of heaven

63
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
and the

64
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
constellations

65
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
thereof shall

66
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
not give their

67
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
light; the

68
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
sun shall be

69
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
darkened in

70
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
his going

71
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
forth, and the

72
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
moon shall not

73
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,
cause her light to shine.

74
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
11 And I

75
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
will punish the

76
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
world for

77
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
evil, and the

78
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
wicked for

79
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
their

80
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
iniquity; I will

81
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
cause the

82
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
arrogancy of

83
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
the proud to

84
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
cease, and

85
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
will lay down

86
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
the

87
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,
haughtiness of the terrible.

88
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
12 I will

89
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
make a man

90
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
more

91
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
precious than fine

92
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
gold; even

93
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
a man than

94
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
the golden

95
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,
wedge of Ophir.

96
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
13

97
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
Therefore, I will

98
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
shake the

99
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
heavens,

100
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
and the

101
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
earth shall

102
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
remove out

103
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
of her

104
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
place, in

105
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
the wrath of

106
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
the Lord

107
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
of Hosts,

108
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
and in the

109
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
day of

110
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,
his fierce anger.

111
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
14 And it

112
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
shall be

113
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
as the

114
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
chased

115
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
roe, and as

116
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
a sheep

117
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
that no

118
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
man taketh

119
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
up; and

120
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
they shall

121
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
every

122
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
man turn to

123
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
his own

124
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
people,

125
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
and flee

126
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
every one

127
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,
into his own land.

128
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
15 Every

129
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
one

130
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
that is

131
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
proud shall

132
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
be

133
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
thrust

134
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
through; yea,

135
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
and

136
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
every one

137
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
that is

138
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
joined to

139
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
the

140
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
wicked

141
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,
shall fall by the sword.

142
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
16

143
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
Their

144
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
children

145
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
also shall

146
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
be

147
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
dashed to

148
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
pieces

149
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
before

150
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
their

151
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0

152
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
their

153
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
houses

154
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
shall be

155
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
spoiled

156
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
and

157
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,
their wives ravished.

158
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
17

159
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
Behold, I

160
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
will

161
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
stir up

162
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
the Medes

163
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0


164
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
against them,

165
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
which

166
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0

00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
nor

172
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0

00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
delight

174
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,
in it.

175
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
18

176
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
Their

00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
19

197
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
And

00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
Babylon,

199
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
the

200
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
glory

201
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
of

202
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0


203
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
kingdoms,

204
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
the

00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
beauty

206
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
of

211
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
excellency,

00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
shall

213
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
be as

214
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
when

215
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
God

216
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0


217
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,
overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.

218
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
20

219
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
It

220
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0

230
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
be

231
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
