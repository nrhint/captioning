00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,4
Chapter 23 The destruction of Babylon is a type of

2
00:00:01,4 --> 00:00:02,8
 the destruction at the Second Coming—It will be a

3
00:00:02,8 --> 00:00:04,2
 day of wrath and vengeance—Babylon (the world)

4
00:00:04,2 --> 00:00:05,6
 will fall forever—Compare 
Isaiah 13. About

5
00:00:05,6 --> 00:00:07,0
 559–545 B.C.

6
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:11,975
1 The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of

7
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:15,975
 Amoz did see

8
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,616
2 Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain,

9
00:00:18,616 --> 00:00:21,283
 exalt the voice unto them, shake the hand, that they

10
00:00:21,283 --> 00:00:23,95
 may go into the gates of the nobles

11
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:26,591
3 I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also

12
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:29,258
 called my mighty ones, for mine anger is not upon

13
00:00:29,258 --> 00:00:31,925
 them that rejoice in my highness

14
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,899
4 The noise of the multitude in the mountains like

15
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,899
 as of a great people, a tumultuous noise of the

16
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:37,899
 kingdoms of nations gathered together, the Lord of

17
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:39,899
 Hosts mustereth the hosts of the battle

18
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,54
5 They come from a far country, from the end of

19
00:00:42,54 --> 00:00:45,207
 heaven, yea, the Lord, and the weapons of his

20
00:00:45,207 --> 00:00:47,874
 indignation, to destroy the whole land

21
00:00:47,848 --> 00:01:03,848
6 Howl ye, for the day of the Lord is at hand; it

22
00:01:03,848 --> 00:01:19,848
 shall come as a destruction from the Almighty

23
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:31,746
7 Therefore shall all hands be faint, every man’s

24
00:01:31,746 --> 00:01:43,746
 heart shall melt

25
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:46,337
8 And they shall be afraid; pangs and sorrows

26
00:01:46,337 --> 00:01:49,004
 shall take hold of them; they shall be amazed one at

27
00:01:49,004 --> 00:01:51,671
 another; their faces shall be as flames

28
00:01:51,645 --> 00:02:07,645
9 Behold, the day of the Lord cometh, cruel both

29
00:02:07,645 --> 00:02:23,645
 with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land

30
00:02:23,645 --> 00:02:39,645
 desolate; and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out

31
00:02:39,645 --> 00:02:55,645
 of it

32
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:59,442
10 For the stars of heaven and the constellations

33
00:02:59,442 --> 00:03:03,442
 thereof shall not give their light; the sun shall

34
00:03:03,442 --> 00:03:07,442
 be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall

35
00:03:07,442 --> 00:03:11,442
 not cause her light to shine

36
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,391
11 And I will punish the world for evil, and the

37
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:15,391
 wicked for their iniquity; I will cause the

38
00:03:15,391 --> 00:03:17,391
 arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay down the

39
00:03:17,391 --> 00:03:19,391
 haughtiness of the terrible

40
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:23,366
12 I will make a man more precious than fine gold;

41
00:03:23,366 --> 00:03:27,366
 even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir

42
00:03:27,34 --> 00:03:31,34
13 Therefore, I will shake the heavens, and the

43
00:03:31,34 --> 00:03:35,34
 earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of

44
00:03:35,34 --> 00:03:39,34
 the Lord of Hosts, and in the day of his fierce

45
00:03:39,34 --> 00:03:43,34
 anger

46
00:03:43,29 --> 00:03:47,29
14 And it shall be as the chased roe, and as a

47
00:03:47,29 --> 00:03:51,29
 sheep that no man taketh up; and they shall every man

48
00:03:51,29 --> 00:03:55,29
 turn to his own people, and flee every one into

49
00:03:55,29 --> 00:03:59,29
 his own land

50
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:04,572
15 Every one that is proud shall be thrust

51
00:04:04,572 --> 00:04:09,905
 through; yea, and every one that is joined to the wicked

52
00:04:09,905 --> 00:04:15,238
 shall fall by the sword

53
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,855
16 Their children also shall be dashed to pieces

54
00:04:17,855 --> 00:04:20,522
 before their eyes; their houses shall be spoiled

55
00:04:20,522 --> 00:04:23,189
 and their wives ravished

56
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:28,496
17 Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them,

57
00:04:28,496 --> 00:04:33,829
 which shall not regard silver and gold, nor shall

58
00:04:33,829 --> 00:04:39,162
 they delight in it

59
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,779
18 Their bows shall also dash the young men to

60
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:44,446
 pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of

61
00:04:44,446 --> 00:04:47,113
 the womb; their eyes shall not spare children

62
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,754
19 And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty

63
00:04:49,754 --> 00:04:52,421
 of the Chaldees’ excellency, shall be as when God

64
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:55,088
 overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah

65
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:59,061
20 It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it

66
00:04:59,061 --> 00:05:03,061
 be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither

67
00:05:03,061 --> 00:05:07,061
 shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall

68
00:05:07,061 --> 00:05:11,061
 the shepherds make their fold there

69
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:14,761
21 But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there;

70
00:05:14,761 --> 00:05:18,511
 and their houses shall be full of doleful

71
00:05:18,511 --> 00:05:22,261
 creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall

72
00:05:22,261 --> 00:05:26,011
 dance there

73
00:05:26,96 --> 00:05:27,127
22 And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in

74
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:27,294
 their desolate houses, and dragons in their

75
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:27,461
 pleasant palaces; and her time is near to come, and her

76
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:27,628
 day shall not be prolonged. For I will destroy

77
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:27,795
 her speedily; yea, for I will be merciful unto my

78
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:27,962
 people, but the wicked shall perish.
