00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:04,0
Chapter 23 The destruction of Babylon is

2
00:00:04,0 --> 00:00:08,0
a type of the destruction at the Second

3
00:00:08,0 --> 00:00:12,0
Coming—It will be a day of wrath and

4
00:00:12,0 --> 00:00:16,0
vengeance—Babylon (the world) will fall

5
00:00:16,0 --> 00:00:20,888
forever—Compare 
Isaiah 13. About 559–545 B.C. 

6
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:20,388
1 The burden of Babylon, which

7
00:00:20,388 --> 00:00:19,953
Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.

8
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:22,553
2 Lift ye up a banner upon

9
00:00:22,553 --> 00:00:25,153
the high mountain, exalt

10
00:00:25,153 --> 00:00:27,753
the voice unto them, shake

11
00:00:27,753 --> 00:00:30,353
the hand, that they may go

12
00:00:30,353 --> 00:00:32,299
into the gates of the nobles.

13
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,899
3 I have commanded my

14
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:37,499
sanctified ones, I have also

15
00:00:37,499 --> 00:00:40,099
called my mighty ones, for

16
00:00:40,099 --> 00:00:42,699
mine anger is not upon

17
00:00:42,699 --> 00:00:45,679
them that rejoice in my highness.

18
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:46,554
4 The noise of the

19
00:00:46,554 --> 00:00:47,429
multitude in the mountains

20
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:48,304
like as of a great

21
00:00:48,304 --> 00:00:49,179
people, a tumultuous noise

22
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:50,054
of the kingdoms of

23
00:00:50,054 --> 00:00:50,929
nations gathered together,

24
00:00:50,929 --> 00:00:51,804
the Lord of Hosts

25
00:00:51,804 --> 00:00:52,719
mustereth the hosts of the battle.

26
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,386
5 They come from a far

27
00:00:55,386 --> 00:00:58,053
country, from the end

28
00:00:58,053 --> 00:01:00,72
of heaven, yea, the

29
00:01:00,72 --> 00:01:03,387
Lord, and the weapons

30
00:01:03,387 --> 00:01:06,054
of his indignation, to

31
00:01:06,054 --> 00:01:08,201
destroy the whole land.

32
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:11,601
6 Howl ye, for the

33
00:01:11,601 --> 00:01:15,001
day of the Lord is

34
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:18,401
at hand; it shall

35
00:01:18,401 --> 00:01:21,801
come as a

36
00:01:21,801 --> 00:01:25,619
destruction from the Almighty.

37
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:25,869
7 Therefore

38
00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:26,119
shall all hands be

39
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:26,369
faint, every

40
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:26,086
man’s heart shall melt;

41
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:26,308
8 And they

42
00:01:26,308 --> 00:01:26,53
shall be afraid;

43
00:01:26,53 --> 00:01:26,752
pangs and sorrows

44
00:01:26,752 --> 00:01:26,974
shall take

45
00:01:26,974 --> 00:01:27,196
hold of them; they

46
00:01:27,196 --> 00:01:27,418
shall be

47
00:01:27,418 --> 00:01:27,64
amazed one at

48
00:01:27,64 --> 00:01:27,862
another; their faces

49
00:01:27,862 --> 00:01:28,488
shall be as flames.

50
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:28,397
9 Behold, the

51
00:01:28,397 --> 00:01:28,306
day of the

52
00:01:28,306 --> 00:01:28,215
Lord cometh,

53
00:01:28,215 --> 00:01:28,124
cruel both with

54
00:01:28,124 --> 00:01:28,033
wrath and fierce

55
00:01:28,033 --> 00:01:27,942
anger, to lay

56
00:01:27,942 --> 00:01:27,851
the land

57
00:01:27,851 --> 00:01:27,76
desolate; and he

58
00:01:27,76 --> 00:01:27,669
shall destroy

59
00:01:27,669 --> 00:01:27,578
the sinners

60
00:01:27,578 --> 00:01:27,554
thereof out of it.

61
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:27,708
10 For the

62
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:27,862
stars of heaven

63
00:01:27,862 --> 00:01:28,016
and the

64
00:01:28,016 --> 00:01:28,17
constellations

65
00:01:28,17 --> 00:01:28,324
thereof shall

66
00:01:28,324 --> 00:01:28,478
not give their

67
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:28,632
light; the

68
00:01:28,632 --> 00:01:28,786
sun shall be

69
00:01:28,786 --> 00:01:28,94
darkened in

70
00:01:28,94 --> 00:01:29,094
his going

71
00:01:29,094 --> 00:01:29,248
forth, and the

72
00:01:29,248 --> 00:01:29,402
moon shall not

73
00:01:29,402 --> 00:01:29,489
cause her light to shine.

74
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:29,989
11 And I

75
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:30,489
will punish the

76
00:01:30,489 --> 00:01:30,989
world for

77
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:31,489
evil, and the

78
00:01:31,489 --> 00:01:31,989
wicked for

79
00:01:31,989 --> 00:01:32,489
their

80
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:32,989
iniquity; I will

81
00:01:32,989 --> 00:01:33,489
cause the

82
00:01:33,489 --> 00:01:33,989
arrogancy of

83
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:34,489
the proud to

84
00:01:34,489 --> 00:01:34,989
cease, and

85
00:01:34,989 --> 00:01:35,489
will lay down

86
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:35,989
the

87
00:01:35,989 --> 00:01:36,964
haughtiness of the terrible.

88
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:37,464
12 I will

89
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:37,964
make a man

90
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:38,464
more

91
00:01:38,464 --> 00:01:38,964
precious than fine

92
00:01:38,964 --> 00:01:39,464
gold; even

93
00:01:39,464 --> 00:01:39,964
a man than

94
00:01:39,964 --> 00:01:40,464
the golden

95
00:01:40,464 --> 00:01:40,434
wedge of Ophir.

96
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:41,634
13

97
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:42,834
Therefore, I will

98
00:01:42,834 --> 00:01:44,034
shake the

99
00:01:44,034 --> 00:01:45,234
heavens,

100
00:01:45,234 --> 00:01:46,434
and the

101
00:01:46,434 --> 00:01:47,634
earth shall

102
00:01:47,634 --> 00:01:48,834
remove out

103
00:01:48,834 --> 00:01:50,034
of her

104
00:01:50,034 --> 00:01:51,234
place, in

105
00:01:51,234 --> 00:01:52,434
the wrath of

106
00:01:52,434 --> 00:01:53,634
the Lord

107
00:01:53,634 --> 00:01:54,834
of Hosts,

108
00:01:54,834 --> 00:01:56,034
and in the

109
00:01:56,034 --> 00:01:57,234
day of

110
00:01:57,234 --> 00:01:58,318
his fierce anger.

111
00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:59,73
14 And it

112
00:01:59,73 --> 00:02:01,142
shall be

113
00:02:01,142 --> 00:02:02,554
as the

114
00:02:02,554 --> 00:02:03,966
chased

115
00:02:03,966 --> 00:02:05,378
roe, and as

116
00:02:05,378 --> 00:02:06,79
a sheep

117
00:02:06,79 --> 00:02:08,202
that no

118
00:02:08,202 --> 00:02:09,614
man taketh

119
00:02:09,614 --> 00:02:11,026
up; and

120
00:02:11,026 --> 00:02:12,438
they shall

121
00:02:12,438 --> 00:02:13,85
every

122
00:02:13,85 --> 00:02:15,262
man turn to

123
00:02:15,262 --> 00:02:16,674
his own

124
00:02:16,674 --> 00:02:18,086
people,

125
00:02:18,086 --> 00:02:19,498
and flee

126
00:02:19,498 --> 00:02:20,91
every one

127
00:02:20,91 --> 00:02:22,709
into his own land.

128
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:22,995
15 Every

129
00:02:22,995 --> 00:02:23,281
one

130
00:02:23,281 --> 00:02:23,567
that is

131
00:02:23,567 --> 00:02:23,853
proud shall

132
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:24,139
be

133
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:24,425
thrust

134
00:02:24,425 --> 00:02:24,711
through; yea,

135
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:24,997
and

136
00:02:24,997 --> 00:02:25,283
every one

137
00:02:25,283 --> 00:02:25,569
that is

138
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:25,855
joined to

139
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:26,141
the

140
00:02:26,141 --> 00:02:26,427
wicked

141
00:02:26,427 --> 00:02:26,179
shall fall by the sword.

142
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:26,117
16

143
00:02:26,117 --> 00:02:26,055
Their

144
00:02:26,055 --> 00:02:25,993
children

145
00:02:25,993 --> 00:02:25,931
also shall

146
00:02:25,931 --> 00:02:25,869
be

147
00:02:25,869 --> 00:02:25,807
dashed to

148
00:02:25,807 --> 00:02:25,745
pieces

149
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:25,683
before

150
00:02:25,683 --> 00:02:25,621
their

151
00:02:25,621 --> 00:02:25,559
eyes;

152
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:25,497
their

153
00:02:25,497 --> 00:02:25,435
houses

154
00:02:25,435 --> 00:02:25,373
shall be

155
00:02:25,373 --> 00:02:25,311
spoiled

156
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:25,249
and

157
00:02:25,249 --> 00:02:25,245
their wives ravished.

158
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:25,421
17

159
00:02:25,421 --> 00:02:25,597
Behold, I

160
00:02:25,597 --> 00:02:25,773
will

161
00:02:25,773 --> 00:02:25,949

164
00:02:26,301 --> 00:02:26,477

165
00:02:26,477 --> 00:02:26,653
which

166
00:02:26,653 --> 00:02:26,829
shall

167
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:27,005

174
00:02:28,061 --> 00:02:28,715
in it.

175
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:29,286

201
00:02:40,402 --> 00:02:40,357

beauty

206
00:02:40,177 --> 00:02:40,132
of
