00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,167
Chapter 26 Christ will minister to the

2
00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:02,334
 Nephites—Nephi foresees the destruction of his people—They

3
00:00:02,334 --> 00:00:03,501
 will speak from the dust—The Gentiles will build up

4
00:00:03,501 --> 00:00:04,668
 false churches and secret combinations—The Lord

5
00:00:04,668 --> 00:00:05,835
 forbids men to practice priestcrafts. About

00:00:05,835 --> 00:00:07,002
 559–545 B.C.

7
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,975
1 And after Christ shall have risen from the dead

8
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:11,975
 he shall show himself unto you, my children, and

9
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:13,975
 my beloved brethren; and the words which he shall

10
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:15,975
 speak unto you shall be the law which ye shall do

11
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,616
2 For behold, I say unto you that I have beheld

12
00:00:18,616 --> 00:00:21,283
 that many generations shall pass away, and there

13
00:00:21,283 --> 00:00:23,95
 shall be great wars and contentions among my people

14
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:24,813
3 And after the Messiah shall come there shall be

15
00:00:24,813 --> 00:00:25,702
 signs given unto my people of his birth, and also

16
00:00:25,702 --> 00:00:26,591
 of his death and resurrection; and great and

17
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:27,48
 terrible shall that day be unto the wicked, for they

18
00:00:27,48 --> 00:00:28,369
 shall perish; and they perish because they cast out

19
00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:29,258
 the prophets, and the saints, and stone them, and

20
00:00:29,258 --> 00:00:30,147
 slay them; wherefore the cry of the blood of the

21
00:00:30,147 --> 00:00:31,036
 saints shall ascend up to God from the ground

22
00:00:31,036 --> 00:00:31,925
 against them

23
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,899
4 Wherefore, all those who are proud, and that do

24
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,899
 wickedly, the day that cometh shall burn them up,

25
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:37,899
 saith the Lord of Hosts, for they shall be as

26
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:39,899
 stubble

27
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,206
5 And they that kill the prophets, and the saints,

28
00:00:41,206 --> 00:00:42,539
 the depths of the earth shall swallow them up,

29
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:43,872
 saith the Lord of Hosts; and mountains shall cover

30
00:00:43,872 --> 00:00:45,205
 them, and whirlwinds shall carry them away, and

31
00:00:45,205 --> 00:00:46,538
 buildings shall fall upon them and crush them to

32
00:00:46,538 --> 00:00:47,871
 pieces and grind them to powder

33
00:00:47,848 --> 00:02:47,515
6 And they shall be visited with thunderings, and

34
00:02:47,515 --> 00:04:47,182
 lightnings, and earthquakes, and all manner of

35
00:04:47,182 --> 00:06:46,849
 destructions, for the fire of the anger of the Lord

36
00:06:46,849 --> 00:08:46,516
 shall be kindled against them, and they shall be as

37
00:08:46,516 --> 00:10:46,183
 stubble, and the day that cometh shall consume

38
00:10:46,183 --> 00:12:45,85
 them, saith the Lord of Hosts

39
00:12:45,565 --> 00:13:11,165
7 O the pain, and the anguish of my soul for the

40
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:36,765
 loss of the slain of my people! For I, Nephi, have

41
00:13:36,765 --> 00:14:02,365
 seen it, and it well nigh consumeth me before the

42
00:14:02,365 --> 00:14:27,965
 presence of the Lord; but I must cry unto my God:

43
00:14:27,965 --> 00:14:53,565
 Thy ways are just

44
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:08,864
10 And when these things have passed away a speedy

45
00:00:08,864 --> 00:00:09,753
 destruction cometh unto my people; for,

46
00:00:09,753 --> 00:00:10,642
 notwithstanding the pains of my soul, I have seen it;

47
00:00:10,642 --> 00:00:11,531
 wherefore, I know that it shall come to pass; and they

48
00:00:11,531 --> 00:00:12,42
 sell themselves for naught; for, for the reward of

49
00:00:12,42 --> 00:00:13,309
 their pride and their foolishness they shall reap

50
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:14,198
 destruction; for because they yield unto the

51
00:00:14,198 --> 00:00:15,087
 devil and choose works of darkness rather than light,

52
00:00:15,087 --> 00:00:15,976
 therefore they must go down to hell

53
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,949
11 For the Spirit of the Lord will not always

54
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:19,949
 strive with man. And when the Spirit ceaseth to strive

55
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:21,949
 with man then cometh speedy destruction, and this

56
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:23,949
 grieveth my soul

57
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,924
12 And as I spake concerning the convincing of the

58
00:00:25,924 --> 00:00:27,924
 Jews, that Jesus is the very Christ, it must

59
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:29,924
 needs be that the Gentiles be convinced also that

60
00:00:29,924 --> 00:00:31,924
 Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God

61
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,232
13 And that he manifesteth himself unto all those

62
00:00:33,232 --> 00:00:34,565
 who believe in him, by the power of the Holy

63
00:00:34,565 --> 00:00:35,898
 Ghost; yea, unto every nation, kindred, tongue, and

64
00:00:35,898 --> 00:00:37,231
 people, working mighty miracles, signs, and wonders,

65
00:00:37,231 --> 00:00:38,564
 among the children of men according to their

66
00:00:38,564 --> 00:00:39,897
 faith

67
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,873
14 But behold, I prophesy unto you concerning the

68
00:00:41,873 --> 00:00:43,873
 last days; concerning the days when the Lord God

69
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:45,873
 shall bring these things forth unto the children of

70
00:00:45,873 --> 00:00:47,873
 men

71
00:00:47,848 --> 00:01:53,121
15 After my seed and the seed of my brethren shall

72
00:01:53,121 --> 00:02:58,394
 have dwindled in unbelief, and shall have been

73
00:02:58,394 --> 00:04:03,667
 smitten by the Gentiles; yea, after the Lord God

74
00:04:03,667 --> 00:05:08,94
 shall have camped against them round about, and shall

75
00:05:08,94 --> 00:06:14,213
 have laid siege against them with a mount, and

76
00:06:14,213 --> 00:07:19,486
 raised forts against them; and after they shall have

77
00:07:19,486 --> 00:08:24,759
 been brought down low in the dust, even that they

78
00:08:24,759 --> 00:09:30,032
 are not, yet the words of the righteous shall be

79
00:09:30,032 --> 00:10:35,305
 written, and the prayers of the faithful shall be

80
00:10:35,305 --> 00:11:40,578
 heard, and all those who have dwindled in unbelief

81
00:11:40,578 --> 00:12:45,851
 shall not be forgotten

82
00:12:45,565 --> 00:13:03,851
16 For those who shall be destroyed shall speak

83
00:13:03,851 --> 00:13:22,137
 unto them out of the ground, and their speech shall

84
00:13:22,137 --> 00:13:40,423
 be low out of the dust, and their voice shall be

85
00:13:40,423 --> 00:13:58,709
 as one that hath a familiar spirit; for the Lord

86
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:16,995
 God will give unto him power, that he may whisper

87
00:14:16,995 --> 00:14:35,281
 concerning them, even as it were out of the ground;

88
00:14:35,281 --> 00:14:53,567
 and their speech shall whisper out of the dust

89
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:10,642
19 And it shall come to pass, that those who have

90
00:00:10,642 --> 00:00:13,309
 dwindled in unbelief shall be smitten by the hand

91
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:15,976
 of the Gentiles

92
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:16,949
20 And the Gentiles are lifted up in the pride of

93
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:17,949
 their eyes, and have stumbled, because of the

94
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:18,949
 greatness of their stumbling block, that they have

95
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:19,949
 built up many churches; nevertheless, they put down

96
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:20,949
 the power and miracles of God, and preach up unto

97
00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:21,949
 themselves their own wisdom and their own learning,

98
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:22,949
 that they may get gain and grind upon the face of

99
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:23,949
 the poor

100
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:27,924
21 And there are many churches built up which

101
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:31,924
 cause envyings, and strifes, and malice

102
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,042
22 And there are also secret combinations, even as

103
00:00:33,042 --> 00:00:34,185
 in times of old, according to the combinations of

104
00:00:34,185 --> 00:00:35,328
 the devil, for he is the founder of all these

105
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,471
 things; yea, the founder of murder, and works of

106
00:00:36,471 --> 00:00:37,614
 darkness; yea, and he leadeth them by the neck with a

107
00:00:37,614 --> 00:00:38,757
 flaxen cord, until he bindeth them with his strong

108
00:00:38,757 --> 00:00:39,9
 cords forever

109
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:43,873
23 For behold, my beloved brethren, I say unto you

110
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:47,873
 that the Lord God worketh not in darkness

111
00:00:47,848 --> 00:03:11,448
24 He doeth not anything save it be for the

112
00:03:11,448 --> 00:05:35,048
 benefit of the world; for he loveth the world, even that

113
00:05:35,048 --> 00:07:58,648
 he layeth down his own life that he may draw all

114
00:07:58,648 --> 00:10:22,248
 men unto him. Wherefore, he commandeth none that

115
00:10:22,248 --> 00:12:45,848
 they shall not partake of his salvation

116
00:12:45,565 --> 00:13:17,565
25 Behold, doth he cry unto any, saying: Depart

117
00:13:17,565 --> 00:13:49,565
 from me? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; but he saith:

118
00:13:49,565 --> 00:14:21,565
 Come unto me all ye ends of the earth, buy milk

119
00:14:21,565 --> 00:14:53,565
 and honey, without money and without price

120
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,975
28 Behold, hath the Lord commanded any that they

121
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:11,975
 should not partake of his goodness? Behold I say

122
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:13,975
 unto you, Nay; but all men are privileged the one

123
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:15,975
 like unto the other, and none are forbidden

124
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,549
29 He commandeth that there shall be no

125
00:00:17,549 --> 00:00:19,149
 priestcrafts; for, behold, priestcrafts are that men preach

126
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:20,749
 and set themselves up for a light unto the world,

127
00:00:20,749 --> 00:00:22,349
 that they may get gain and praise of the world;

128
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:23,949
 but they seek not the welfare of Zion

129
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,257
30 Behold, the Lord hath forbidden this thing;

130
00:00:25,257 --> 00:00:26,59
 wherefore, the Lord God hath given a commandment that

131
00:00:26,59 --> 00:00:27,923
 all men should have charity, which charity is

132
00:00:27,923 --> 00:00:29,256
 love. And except they should have charity they were

133
00:00:29,256 --> 00:00:30,589
 nothing. Wherefore, if they should have charity

134
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:31,922
 they would not suffer the laborer in Zion to perish

135
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:35,899
31 But the laborer in Zion shall labor for Zion;

136
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:39,899
 for if they labor for money they shall perish

137
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:40,762
32 And again, the Lord God hath commanded that men

138
00:00:40,762 --> 00:00:41,651
 should not murder; that they should not lie; that

139
00:00:41,651 --> 00:00:42,54
 they should not steal; that they should not take

140
00:00:42,54 --> 00:00:43,429
 the name of the Lord their God in vain; that they

141
00:00:43,429 --> 00:00:44,318
 should not envy; that they should not have malice;

142
00:00:44,318 --> 00:00:45,207
 that they should not contend one with another;

143
00:00:45,207 --> 00:00:46,096
 that they should not commit whoredoms; and that they

144
00:00:46,096 --> 00:00:46,985
 should do none of these things; for whoso doeth

145
00:00:46,985 --> 00:00:47,874
 them shall perish

146
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:48,737
33 For none of these iniquities come of the Lord;

147
00:00:48,737 --> 00:00:49,626
 for he doeth that which is good among the children

148
00:00:49,626 --> 00:00:50,515
 of men; and he doeth nothing save it be plain

149
00:00:50,515 --> 00:00:51,404
 unto the children of men; and he inviteth them all to

150
00:00:51,404 --> 00:00:52,293
 come unto him and partake of his goodness; and he

151
00:00:52,293 --> 00:00:53,182
 denieth none that come unto him, black and white,

152
00:00:53,182 --> 00:00:54,071
 bond and free, male and female; and he

153
00:00:54,071 --> 00:00:54,96
 remembereth the heathen; and all are alike unto God, both

154
00:00:54,96 --> 00:00:55,849
 Jew and Gentile.
