1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 26 Christ will minister to the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Nephites—Nephi foresees the destruction of

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
his people—They will speak from the dust—The

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Gentiles will build up false churches and

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
secret combinations—The Lord forbids men

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:07:30,
to practice priestcrafts. About 559–545 B.C. 

7
00:07:30,0 --> 00:07:30,0
1 And after Christ shall have risen

8
00:07:30,0 --> 00:07:30,0
from the dead he shall show himself unto

9
00:07:30,0 --> 00:07:30,0
you, my children, and my beloved

10
00:07:30,0 --> 00:07:30,0
brethren; and the words which he shall speak

11
00:07:30,0 --> 00:15:13,
unto you shall be the law which ye shall do.

12
00:15:13,0 --> 00:15:13,0
2 For behold, I say unto you that I

13
00:15:13,0 --> 00:15:13,0
have beheld that many generations

14
00:15:13,0 --> 00:15:13,0
shall pass away, and there shall be great

15
00:15:13,0 --> 00:14:59,
wars and contentions among my people.

16
00:14:59,0 --> 00:14:59,0
3 And after the Messiah shall come

17
00:14:59,0 --> 00:14:59,0
there shall be signs given unto

18
00:14:59,0 --> 00:14:59,0
my people of his birth, and also of

19
00:14:59,0 --> 00:14:59,0
his death and resurrection; and

20
00:14:59,0 --> 00:14:59,0
great and terrible shall that day

21
00:14:59,0 --> 00:14:59,0
be unto the wicked, for they shall

22
00:14:59,0 --> 00:14:59,0
perish; and they perish because

23
00:14:59,0 --> 00:14:59,0
they cast out the prophets, and the

24
00:14:59,0 --> 00:14:59,0
saints, and stone them, and slay

25
00:14:59,0 --> 00:14:59,0
them; wherefore the cry of the

26
00:14:59,0 --> 00:14:59,0
blood of the saints shall ascend up to

27
00:14:59,0 --> 00:19:12,
God from the ground against them.

28
00:19:12,0 --> 00:19:12,0
4 Wherefore, all those who are

29
00:19:12,0 --> 00:19:12,0
proud, and that do wickedly,

30
00:19:12,0 --> 00:19:12,0
the day that cometh shall burn

31
00:19:12,0 --> 00:19:12,0
them up, saith the Lord of

32
00:19:12,0 --> 00:23:11,
Hosts, for they shall be as stubble.

33
00:23:11,0 --> 00:23:11,0
5 And they that kill the

34
00:23:11,0 --> 00:23:11,0
prophets, and the saints, the

35
00:23:11,0 --> 00:23:11,0
depths of the earth shall

36
00:23:11,0 --> 00:23:11,0
swallow them up, saith the

37
00:23:11,0 --> 00:23:11,0
Lord of Hosts; and

38
00:23:11,0 --> 00:23:11,0
mountains shall cover them, and

39
00:23:11,0 --> 00:23:11,0
whirlwinds shall carry them

40
00:23:11,0 --> 00:23:11,0
away, and buildings shall

41
00:23:11,0 --> 00:23:11,0
fall upon them and crush them

42
00:23:11,0 --> 00:26:07,
to pieces and grind them to powder.

43
00:26:07,0 --> 00:26:07,0
6 And they shall be

44
00:26:07,0 --> 00:26:07,0
visited with thunderings, and

45
00:26:07,0 --> 00:26:07,0
lightnings, and

46
00:26:07,0 --> 00:26:07,0
earthquakes, and all manner of

47
00:26:07,0 --> 00:26:07,0
destructions, for the fire

48
00:26:07,0 --> 00:26:07,0
of the anger of the Lord

49
00:26:07,0 --> 00:26:07,0
shall be kindled against

50
00:26:07,0 --> 00:26:07,0
them, and they shall be as

51
00:26:07,0 --> 00:26:07,0
stubble, and the day

52
00:26:07,0 --> 00:26:07,0
that cometh shall consume

53
00:26:07,0 --> 00:25:39,
them, saith the Lord of Hosts.

54
00:25:39,0 --> 00:25:39,0
7 O the pain, and the

55
00:25:39,0 --> 00:25:39,0
anguish of my soul for the

56
00:25:39,0 --> 00:25:39,0
loss of the slain of my

57
00:25:39,0 --> 00:25:39,0
people! For I, Nephi,

58
00:25:39,0 --> 00:25:39,0
have seen it, and it well

59
00:25:39,0 --> 00:25:39,0
nigh consumeth me

60
00:25:39,0 --> 00:25:39,0
before the presence of the

61
00:25:39,0 --> 00:25:39,0
Lord; but I must cry unto

62
00:25:39,0 --> 00:26:09,
my God: Thy ways are just.

63
00:26:09,0 --> 00:26:09,0
8 But behold, the

64
00:26:09,0 --> 00:26:09,0
righteous that hearken

65
00:26:09,0 --> 00:26:09,0
unto the words of the

66
00:26:09,0 --> 00:26:09,0
prophets, and destroy

67
00:26:09,0 --> 00:26:09,0
them not, but look

68
00:26:09,0 --> 00:26:09,0
forward unto Christ with

69
00:26:09,0 --> 00:26:09,0
steadfastness for the

70
00:26:09,0 --> 00:26:09,0
signs which are given,

71
00:26:09,0 --> 00:26:09,0
notwithstanding all

72
00:26:09,0 --> 00:26:09,0
persecution—behold, they

73
00:26:09,0 --> 00:25:41,
are they which shall not perish.

74
00:25:41,0 --> 00:25:41,0
9 But the Son of

75
00:25:41,0 --> 00:25:41,0
Righteousness shall

76
00:25:41,0 --> 00:25:41,0
appear unto them; and he

77
00:25:41,0 --> 00:25:41,0
shall heal them, and

78
00:25:41,0 --> 00:25:41,0
they shall have peace

79
00:25:41,0 --> 00:25:41,0
with him, until three

80
00:25:41,0 --> 00:25:41,0
generations shall

81
00:25:41,0 --> 00:25:41,0
have passed away, and

82
00:25:41,0 --> 00:25:41,0
many of the fourth

83
00:25:41,0 --> 00:25:41,0
generation shall have

84
00:25:41,0 --> 00:26:11,
passed away in righteousness.

85
00:26:11,0 --> 00:26:11,0
10 And when these

86
00:26:11,0 --> 00:26:11,0
things have passed

87
00:26:11,0 --> 00:26:11,0
away a speedy

88
00:26:11,0 --> 00:26:11,0
destruction cometh unto my

89
00:26:11,0 --> 00:26:11,0
people; for,

90
00:26:11,0 --> 00:26:11,0
notwithstanding the pains of

91
00:26:11,0 --> 00:26:11,0
my soul, I have seen

92
00:26:11,0 --> 00:26:11,0
it; wherefore, I

93
00:26:11,0 --> 00:26:11,0
know that it shall

94
00:26:11,0 --> 00:26:11,0
come to pass; and they

95
00:26:11,0 --> 00:26:11,0
sell themselves for

96
00:26:11,0 --> 00:26:11,0
naught; for, for the

97
00:26:11,0 --> 00:26:11,0
reward of their

98
00:26:11,0 --> 00:26:11,0
pride and their

99
00:26:11,0 --> 00:26:11,0
foolishness they shall reap

100
00:26:11,0 --> 00:26:11,0
destruction; for

101
00:26:11,0 --> 00:26:11,0
because they yield

102
00:26:11,0 --> 00:26:11,0
unto the devil and

103
00:26:11,0 --> 00:26:11,0
choose works of darkness

104
00:26:11,0 --> 00:26:11,0
rather than light,

105
00:26:11,0 --> 00:25:43,
therefore they must go down to hell.

106
00:25:43,0 --> 00:25:43,0
11 For the Spirit

107
00:25:43,0 --> 00:25:43,0
of the Lord will

108
00:25:43,0 --> 00:25:43,0
not always strive

109
00:25:43,0 --> 00:25:43,0
with man. And when

110
00:25:43,0 --> 00:25:43,0
the Spirit ceaseth

111
00:25:43,0 --> 00:25:43,0
to strive with

112
00:25:43,0 --> 00:25:43,0
man then cometh

113
00:25:43,0 --> 00:25:43,0
speedy destruction,

114
00:25:43,0 --> 00:25:57,
and this grieveth my soul.

115
00:25:57,0 --> 00:25:57,0
12 And as I

116
00:25:57,0 --> 00:25:57,0
spake concerning the

117
00:25:57,0 --> 00:25:57,0
convincing of

118
00:25:57,0 --> 00:25:57,0
the Jews, that

119
00:25:57,0 --> 00:25:57,0
Jesus is the very

120
00:25:57,0 --> 00:25:57,0
Christ, it must

121
00:25:57,0 --> 00:25:57,0
needs be that

122
00:25:57,0 --> 00:25:57,0
the Gentiles be

123
00:25:57,0 --> 00:25:57,0
convinced also

124
00:25:57,0 --> 00:25:57,0
that Jesus is the

125
00:25:57,0 --> 00:28:09,
Christ, the Eternal God;

126
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
13 And that he

127
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
manifesteth

128
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
himself unto all

129
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
those who

130
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
believe in him, by

131
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
the power of the

132
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
Holy Ghost;

133
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
yea, unto every

134
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
nation, kindred,

135
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
tongue, and

136
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
people, working

137
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
mighty miracles,

138
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
signs, and

139
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
wonders, among the

140
00:28:09,0 --> 00:28:09,0
children of men

141
00:28:09,0 --> 00:27:41,
according to their faith.

142
00:27:41,0 --> 00:27:41,0
14 But behold,

143
00:27:41,0 --> 00:27:41,0
I prophesy

144
00:27:41,0 --> 00:27:41,0
unto you

145
00:27:41,0 --> 00:27:41,0
concerning the last

146
00:27:41,0 --> 00:27:41,0
days;

147
00:27:41,0 --> 00:27:41,0
concerning the days

148
00:27:41,0 --> 00:27:41,0
when the Lord God

149
00:27:41,0 --> 00:27:41,0
shall bring

150
00:27:41,0 --> 00:27:41,0
these things

151
00:27:41,0 --> 00:27:41,0
forth unto the

152
00:27:41,0 --> 00:31:11,
children of men.

153
00:31:11,0 --> 00:31:11,0
15 After my

154
00:31:11,0 --> 00:31:11,0
seed and the

155
00:31:11,0 --> 00:31:11,0
seed of my

156
00:31:11,0 --> 00:31:11,0
brethren shall

157
00:31:11,0 --> 00:31:11,0
have dwindled

158
00:31:11,0 --> 00:31:11,0
in unbelief,

159
00:31:11,0 --> 00:31:11,0
and shall

160
00:31:11,0 --> 00:31:11,0
have been

161
00:31:11,0 --> 00:31:11,0
smitten by the

162
00:31:11,0 --> 00:31:11,0
Gentiles; yea,

163
00:31:11,0 --> 00:31:11,0
after the Lord

164
00:31:11,0 --> 00:31:11,0
God shall

165
00:31:11,0 --> 00:31:11,0
have camped

166
00:31:11,0 --> 00:31:11,0
against them

167
00:31:11,0 --> 00:31:11,0
round about, and

168
00:31:11,0 --> 00:31:11,0
shall have

169
00:31:11,0 --> 00:31:11,0
laid siege

170
00:31:11,0 --> 00:31:11,0
against them with

171
00:31:11,0 --> 00:31:11,0
a mount, and

172
00:31:11,0 --> 00:31:11,0
raised forts

173
00:31:11,0 --> 00:31:11,0
against

174
00:31:11,0 --> 00:31:11,0
them; and after

175
00:31:11,0 --> 00:31:11,0
they shall

176
00:31:11,0 --> 00:31:11,0
have been

177
00:31:11,0 --> 00:31:11,0
brought down low in

178
00:31:11,0 --> 00:31:11,0
the dust,

179
00:31:11,0 --> 00:31:11,0
even that they

180
00:31:11,0 --> 00:31:11,0
are not, yet

181
00:31:11,0 --> 00:31:11,0
the words of

182
00:31:11,0 --> 00:31:11,0
the righteous

183
00:31:11,0 --> 00:31:11,0
shall be

184
00:31:11,0 --> 00:31:11,0
written, and the

185
00:31:11,0 --> 00:31:11,0
prayers of

186
00:31:11,0 --> 00:31:11,0
the faithful

187
00:31:11,0 --> 00:31:11,0
shall be

188
00:31:11,0 --> 00:31:11,0
heard, and all

189
00:31:11,0 --> 00:31:11,0
those who have

190
00:31:11,0 --> 00:32:09,
dwindled in unbelief shall not be forgotten.

191
00:32:09,0 --> 00:32:09,0
16 For those

192
00:32:09,0 --> 00:32:09,0
who shall

193
00:32:09,0 --> 00:32:09,0
be destroyed

194
00:32:09,0 --> 00:32:09,0
shall speak

195
00:32:09,0 --> 00:32:09,0
unto them

196
00:32:09,0 --> 00:32:09,0
out of the

197
00:32:09,0 --> 00:32:09,0
ground, and

198
00:32:09,0 --> 00:32:09,0
their speech

199
00:32:09,0 --> 00:32:09,0
shall be low

200
00:32:09,0 --> 00:32:09,0
out of the

201
00:32:09,0 --> 00:32:09,0
dust, and

202
00:32:09,0 --> 00:32:09,0
their voice

203
00:32:09,0 --> 00:32:09,0
shall be as one

204
00:32:09,0 --> 00:32:09,0
that hath a

205
00:32:09,0 --> 00:32:09,0
familiar

206
00:32:09,0 --> 00:32:09,0
spirit; for the

207
00:32:09,0 --> 00:32:09,0
Lord God

208
00:32:09,0 --> 00:32:09,0
will give unto

209
00:32:09,0 --> 00:32:09,0
him power,

210
00:32:09,0 --> 00:32:09,0
that he may

211
00:32:09,0 --> 00:32:09,0
whisper

212
00:32:09,0 --> 00:32:09,0
concerning them,

213
00:32:09,0 --> 00:32:09,0
even as it

214
00:32:09,0 --> 00:32:09,0
were out of

215
00:32:09,0 --> 00:32:09,0
the ground;

216
00:32:09,0 --> 00:32:09,0
and their

217
00:32:09,0 --> 00:35:05,
speech shall whisper out of the dust.

218
00:35:05,0 --> 00:35:05,0
17 For thus

219
00:35:05,0 --> 00:35:05,0
saith the

220
00:35:05,0 --> 00:35:05,0
Lord God:

221
00:35:05,0 --> 00:35:05,0
They shall

222
00:35:05,0 --> 00:35:05,0
write the

223
00:35:05,0 --> 00:35:05,0
things which

224
00:35:05,0 --> 00:35:05,0
shall be

225
00:35:05,0 --> 00:35:05,0
done among

226
00:35:05,0 --> 00:35:05,0
them, and

227
00:35:05,0 --> 00:35:05,0
they shall be

228
00:35:05,0 --> 00:35:05,0
written and

229
00:35:05,0 --> 00:35:05,0
sealed up

230
00:35:05,0 --> 00:35:05,0
in a book,

231
00:35:05,0 --> 00:35:05,0
and those

232
00:35:05,0 --> 00:35:05,0
who have

233
00:35:05,0 --> 00:35:05,0
dwindled in

234
00:35:05,0 --> 00:35:05,0
unbelief

235
00:35:05,0 --> 00:35:05,0
shall not have

236
00:35:05,0 --> 00:35:05,0
them, for

237
00:35:05,0 --> 00:35:05,0
they seek to

238
00:35:05,0 --> 00:34:37,
destroy the things of God.

239
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
18

240
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
Wherefore, as those

241
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
who have

242
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
been

243
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
destroyed have

244
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
been destroyed

245
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
speedily;

246
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
and the

247
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
multitude of

248
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
their

249
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
terrible ones

250
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
shall be as

251
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
chaff that

252
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
passeth

253
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
away—yea, thus

254
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
saith the

255
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
Lord God: It

256
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
shall be at

257
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
an

258
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,
instant, suddenly—

259
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
19 And it

260
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
shall come

261
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
to pass,

262
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
that those

263
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
who have

264
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
dwindled

265
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
in unbelief

266
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
shall be

267
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
smitten by

268
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
the hand

269
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,
of the Gentiles.

270
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
20 And the

271
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
Gentiles

272
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
are lifted

273
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
up in the

274
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
pride of

275
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
their

276
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
eyes, and have

277
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
stumbled,

278
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
because

279
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
of the

280
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
greatness of

281
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
their

282
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
stumbling

283
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
block, that

284
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
they have

285
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
built up many

286
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
churches;

287
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0


288
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
nevertheless, they

289
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
put down

290
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
the power

291
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
and

292
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
miracles of God,

293
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
and preach

294
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
up unto

295
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
themselves

296
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
their own

297
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
wisdom and

298
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
their own

299
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
learning,

300
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
that they

301
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
may get

302
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
gain and

303
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
grind upon

304
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
the face of

305
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,
the poor.

306
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
21 And

307
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
there are

308
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
many

309
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
churches built

310
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
up which

311
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
cause

312
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
envyings,

313
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
and

314
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,
strifes, and malice.

315
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
22 And

316
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
there are

317
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0

318
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
secret

319
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
combinations,

320
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
even as in

321
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
times of

322
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
old,

323
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
according to

324
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
the

325
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
combinations

326
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
of the

327
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
devil, for

328
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
he is the

329
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
founder

330
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
of all

331
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
these

332
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
things; yea,

333
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
the founder

334
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
of

335
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
murder, and

336
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
works of

337
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
darkness;

338
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
yea, and

339
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
he leadeth

340
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
them by

341
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
the neck

342
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
with a

343
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
flaxen

344
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
cord, until

345
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
he bindeth

346
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
them

347
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
with his

348
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
strong cords

349
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,
forever.

350
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
23 For

351
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
behold,

352
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
my

353
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
beloved

354
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
brethren, I

355
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
say unto

356
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
you that

357
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
the Lord

358
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
God

359
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
worketh not

360
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,
in darkness.

361
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
24 He

362
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
doeth

363
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
not

364
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
anything

365
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
save it be

366
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
for

367
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
the

368
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
benefit of

369
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
the

370
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
world; for

371
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
he

372
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
loveth the

373
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
world,

374
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
even

375
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
that he

376
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
layeth

377
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
down his

378
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
own

379
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
life that

380
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
he may

381
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
draw

382
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
all men

383
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
unto

384
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
him.

385
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
Wherefore,

386
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
he

387
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
commandeth

388
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
none

389
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
that they

390
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,
shall not partake of his salvation.

391
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
25

392
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
Behold,

393
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
doth he

394
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
cry

395
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0

396
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
any,

397
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0

Depart

399
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0

400
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
me?

401
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
Behold, I

unto

404
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
you,

405
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
Nay; but

00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0

408
00:34:37,0 --> 00:34:37,0
Come
