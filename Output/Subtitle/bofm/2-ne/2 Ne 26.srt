1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:02,333
Chapter 26 Christ will minister to the

2
00:00:02,333 --> 00:00:04,666
Nephites—Nephi foresees the destruction of

3
00:00:04,666 --> 00:00:06,999
his people—They will speak from the dust—The

4
00:00:06,999 --> 00:00:09,332
Gentiles will build up false churches and

5
00:00:09,332 --> 00:00:11,665
secret combinations—The Lord forbids men

6
00:00:11,665 --> 00:00:14,982
to practice priestcrafts. About 559–545 B.C. 

7
00:00:14,982 --> 00:00:15,582
1 And after Christ shall have risen

8
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:16,182
from the dead he shall show himself unto

9
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:16,782
you, my children, and my beloved

10
00:00:16,782 --> 00:00:17,382
brethren; and the words which he shall speak

11
00:00:17,382 --> 00:00:17,985
unto you shall be the law which ye shall do.

12
00:00:17,985 --> 00:00:20,485
2 For behold, I say unto you that I

13
00:00:20,485 --> 00:00:22,985
have beheld that many generations

14
00:00:22,985 --> 00:00:25,485
shall pass away, and there shall be great

15
00:00:25,485 --> 00:00:27,895
wars and contentions among my people.

16
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:28,645
3 And after the Messiah shall come

17
00:00:28,645 --> 00:00:29,395
there shall be signs given unto

18
00:00:29,395 --> 00:00:30,145
my people of his birth, and also of

19
00:00:30,145 --> 00:00:30,895
his death and resurrection; and

20
00:00:30,895 --> 00:00:31,645
great and terrible shall that day

21
00:00:31,645 --> 00:00:32,395
be unto the wicked, for they shall

22
00:00:32,395 --> 00:00:33,145
perish; and they perish because

23
00:00:33,145 --> 00:00:33,895
they cast out the prophets, and the

24
00:00:33,895 --> 00:00:34,645
saints, and stone them, and slay

25
00:00:34,645 --> 00:00:35,395
them; wherefore the cry of the

26
00:00:35,395 --> 00:00:36,145
blood of the saints shall ascend up to

27
00:00:36,145 --> 00:00:36,87
God from the ground against them.

28
00:00:36,87 --> 00:00:38,87
4 Wherefore, all those who are

29
00:00:38,87 --> 00:00:40,87
proud, and that do wickedly,

30
00:00:40,87 --> 00:00:42,87
the day that cometh shall burn

31
00:00:42,87 --> 00:00:44,87
them up, saith the Lord of

32
00:00:44,87 --> 00:00:46,78
Hosts, for they shall be as stubble.

33
00:00:46,78 --> 00:00:46,68
5 And they that kill the

34
00:00:46,68 --> 00:00:46,58
prophets, and the saints, the

35
00:00:46,58 --> 00:00:46,48
depths of the earth shall

36
00:00:46,48 --> 00:00:46,38
swallow them up, saith the

37
00:00:46,38 --> 00:00:46,28
Lord of Hosts; and

38
00:00:46,28 --> 00:00:46,18
mountains shall cover them, and

39
00:00:46,18 --> 00:00:46,08
whirlwinds shall carry them

40
00:00:46,08 --> 00:00:45,98
away, and buildings shall

41
00:00:45,98 --> 00:00:45,88
fall upon them and crush them

42
00:00:45,88 --> 00:00:45,846
to pieces and grind them to powder.

43
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:46,573
6 And they shall be

44
00:00:46,573 --> 00:00:47,3
visited with thunderings, and

45
00:00:47,3 --> 00:00:48,027
lightnings, and

46
00:00:48,027 --> 00:00:48,754
earthquakes, and all manner of

47
00:00:48,754 --> 00:00:49,481
destructions, for the fire

48
00:00:49,481 --> 00:00:50,208
of the anger of the Lord

49
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:50,935
shall be kindled against

50
00:00:50,935 --> 00:00:51,662
them, and they shall be as

51
00:00:51,662 --> 00:00:52,389
stubble, and the day

52
00:00:52,389 --> 00:00:53,116
that cometh shall consume

53
00:00:53,116 --> 00:00:53,82
them, saith the Lord of Hosts.

54
00:00:53,82 --> 00:00:54,264
7 O the pain, and the

55
00:00:54,264 --> 00:00:54,708
anguish of my soul for the

56
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:55,152
loss of the slain of my

57
00:00:55,152 --> 00:00:55,596
people! For I, Nephi,

58
00:00:55,596 --> 00:00:56,04
have seen it, and it well

59
00:00:56,04 --> 00:00:56,484
nigh consumeth me

60
00:00:56,484 --> 00:00:56,928
before the presence of the

61
00:00:56,928 --> 00:00:57,372
Lord; but I must cry unto

62
00:00:57,372 --> 00:00:57,291
my God: Thy ways are just.

63
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:57,746
8 But behold, the

64
00:00:57,746 --> 00:00:58,201
righteous that hearken

65
00:00:58,201 --> 00:00:58,656
unto the words of the

66
00:00:58,656 --> 00:00:59,111
prophets, and destroy

67
00:00:59,111 --> 00:00:59,566
them not, but look

68
00:00:59,566 --> 00:01:00,021
forward unto Christ with

69
00:01:00,021 --> 00:01:00,476
steadfastness for the

70
00:01:00,476 --> 00:01:00,931
signs which are given,

71
00:01:00,931 --> 00:01:01,386
notwithstanding all

72
00:01:01,386 --> 00:01:01,841
persecution—behold, they

73
00:01:01,841 --> 00:01:02,229
are they which shall not perish.

74
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:03,956
9 But the Son of

75
00:01:03,956 --> 00:01:05,683
Righteousness shall

76
00:01:05,683 --> 00:01:07,41
appear unto them; and he

77
00:01:07,41 --> 00:01:09,137
shall heal them, and

78
00:01:09,137 --> 00:01:10,864
they shall have peace

79
00:01:10,864 --> 00:01:12,591
with him, until three

80
00:01:12,591 --> 00:01:14,318
generations shall

81
00:01:14,318 --> 00:01:16,045
have passed away, and

82
00:01:16,045 --> 00:01:17,772
many of the fourth

83
00:01:17,772 --> 00:01:19,499
generation shall have

84
00:01:19,499 --> 00:01:21,181
passed away in righteousness.

85
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:21,133
10 And when these

86
00:01:21,133 --> 00:01:21,085
things have passed

87
00:01:21,085 --> 00:01:21,037
away a speedy

88
00:01:21,037 --> 00:01:20,989
destruction cometh unto my

89
00:01:20,989 --> 00:01:20,941
people; for,

90
00:01:20,941 --> 00:01:20,893
notwithstanding the pains of

91
00:01:20,893 --> 00:01:20,845
my soul, I have seen

92
00:01:20,845 --> 00:01:20,797
it; wherefore, I

93
00:01:20,797 --> 00:01:20,749
know that it shall

94
00:01:20,749 --> 00:01:20,701
come to pass; and they

95
00:01:20,701 --> 00:01:20,653
sell themselves for

96
00:01:20,653 --> 00:01:20,605
naught; for, for the

97
00:01:20,605 --> 00:01:20,557
reward of their

98
00:01:20,557 --> 00:01:20,509
pride and their

99
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:20,461
foolishness they shall reap

100
00:01:20,461 --> 00:01:20,413
destruction; for

101
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:20,365
because they yield

102
00:01:20,365 --> 00:01:20,317
unto the devil and

103
00:01:20,317 --> 00:01:20,269
choose works of darkness

104
00:01:20,269 --> 00:01:20,221
rather than light,

105
00:01:20,221 --> 00:01:20,247
therefore they must go down to hell.

106
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:20,136
11 For the Spirit

107
00:01:20,136 --> 00:01:20,025
of the Lord will

108
00:01:20,025 --> 00:01:19,914
not always strive

109
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:19,803
with man. And when

110
00:01:19,803 --> 00:01:19,692
the Spirit ceaseth

111
00:01:19,692 --> 00:01:19,581
to strive with

112
00:01:19,581 --> 00:01:19,47
man then cometh

113
00:01:19,47 --> 00:01:19,359
speedy destruction,

114
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:19,313
and this grieveth my soul.

115
00:01:19,313 --> 00:01:19,404
12 And as I

116
00:01:19,404 --> 00:01:19,495
spake concerning the

117
00:01:19,495 --> 00:01:19,586
convincing of

118
00:01:19,586 --> 00:01:19,677
the Jews, that

119
00:01:19,677 --> 00:01:19,768
Jesus is the very

120
00:01:19,768 --> 00:01:19,859
Christ, it must

121
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:19,95
needs be that

122
00:01:19,95 --> 00:01:20,041
the Gentiles be

123
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:20,132
convinced also

124
00:01:20,132 --> 00:01:20,223
that Jesus is the

125
00:01:20,223 --> 00:01:20,314
Christ, the Eternal God;

126
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:20,252
13 And that he

127
00:01:20,252 --> 00:01:20,19
manifesteth

128
00:01:20,19 --> 00:01:20,128
himself unto all

129
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:20,066
those who

130
00:01:20,066 --> 00:01:20,004
believe in him, by

131
00:01:20,004 --> 00:01:19,942
the power of the

132
00:01:19,942 --> 00:01:19,88
Holy Ghost;

133
00:01:19,88 --> 00:01:19,818
yea, unto every

134
00:01:19,818 --> 00:01:19,756
nation, kindred,

135
00:01:19,756 --> 00:01:19,694
tongue, and

136
00:01:19,694 --> 00:01:19,632
people, working

137
00:01:19,632 --> 00:01:19,57
mighty miracles,

138
00:01:19,57 --> 00:01:19,508
signs, and

139
00:01:19,508 --> 00:01:19,446
wonders, among the

140
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:19,384
children of men

141
00:01:19,384 --> 00:01:19,379
according to their faith.

142
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:19,47
14 But behold,

143
00:01:19,47 --> 00:01:19,561
I prophesy

144
00:01:19,561 --> 00:01:19,652
unto you

145
00:01:19,652 --> 00:01:19,743
concerning the last

146
00:01:19,743 --> 00:01:19,834
days;

147
00:01:19,834 --> 00:01:19,925
concerning the days

148
00:01:19,925 --> 00:01:20,016
when the Lord God

149
00:01:20,016 --> 00:01:20,107
shall bring

150
00:01:20,107 --> 00:01:20,198
these things

151
00:01:20,198 --> 00:01:20,289
forth unto the

152
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:20,38
children of men.

153
00:01:20,38 --> 00:01:20,354
15 After my

154
00:01:20,354 --> 00:01:20,328
seed and the

155
00:01:20,328 --> 00:01:20,302
seed of my

156
00:01:20,302 --> 00:01:20,276
brethren shall

157
00:01:20,276 --> 00:01:20,25
have dwindled

158
00:01:20,25 --> 00:01:20,224
in unbelief,

159
00:01:20,224 --> 00:01:20,198
and shall

160
00:01:20,198 --> 00:01:20,172
have been

161
00:01:20,172 --> 00:01:20,146
smitten by the

162
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:20,12
Gentiles; yea,

163
00:01:20,12 --> 00:01:20,094
after the Lord

164
00:01:20,094 --> 00:01:20,068
God shall

165
00:01:20,068 --> 00:01:20,042
have camped

166
00:01:20,042 --> 00:01:20,016
against them

167
00:01:20,016 --> 00:01:19,99
round about, and

168
00:01:19,99 --> 00:01:19,964
shall have

169
00:01:19,964 --> 00:01:19,938
laid siege

170
00:01:19,938 --> 00:01:19,912
against them with

171
00:01:19,912 --> 00:01:19,886
a mount, and

172
00:01:19,886 --> 00:01:19,86
raised forts

173
00:01:19,86 --> 00:01:19,834
against

174
00:01:19,834 --> 00:01:19,808
them; and after

175
00:01:19,808 --> 00:01:19,782
they shall

176
00:01:19,782 --> 00:01:19,756
have been

177
00:01:19,756 --> 00:01:19,73
brought down low in

178
00:01:19,73 --> 00:01:19,704
the dust,

179
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:19,678
even that they

180
00:01:19,678 --> 00:01:19,652
are not, yet

181
00:01:19,652 --> 00:01:19,626
the words of

182
00:01:19,626 --> 00:01:19,6
the righteous

183
00:01:19,6 --> 00:01:19,574
shall be

184
00:01:19,574 --> 00:01:19,548
written, and the

185
00:01:19,548 --> 00:01:19,522
prayers of

186
00:01:19,522 --> 00:01:19,496
the faithful

187
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:19,47
shall be

188
00:01:19,47 --> 00:01:19,444
heard, and all

189
00:01:19,444 --> 00:01:19,418
those who have

190
00:01:19,418 --> 00:01:19,446
dwindled in unbelief shall not be forgotten.

191
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:19,52
16 For those

192
00:01:19,52 --> 00:01:19,594
who shall

193
00:01:19,594 --> 00:01:19,668
be destroyed

194
00:01:19,668 --> 00:01:19,742
shall speak

195
00:01:19,742 --> 00:01:19,816
unto them

196
00:01:19,816 --> 00:01:19,89
out of the

197
00:01:19,89 --> 00:01:19,964
ground, and

198
00:01:19,964 --> 00:01:20,038
their speech

199
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:20,112
shall be low

200
00:01:20,112 --> 00:01:20,186
out of the

201
00:01:20,186 --> 00:01:20,26
dust, and

202
00:01:20,26 --> 00:01:20,334
their voice

203
00:01:20,334 --> 00:01:20,408
shall be as one

204
00:01:20,408 --> 00:01:20,482
that hath a

205
00:01:20,482 --> 00:01:20,556
familiar

206
00:01:20,556 --> 00:01:20,63
spirit; for the

207
00:01:20,63 --> 00:01:20,704
Lord God

208
00:01:20,704 --> 00:01:20,778
will give unto

209
00:01:20,778 --> 00:01:20,852
him power,

210
00:01:20,852 --> 00:01:20,926
that he may

211
00:01:20,926 --> 00:01:21,0
whisper

212
00:01:21,0 --> 00:01:21,074
concerning them,

213
00:01:21,074 --> 00:01:21,148
even as it

214
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:21,222
were out of

215
00:01:21,222 --> 00:01:21,296
the ground;

216
00:01:21,296 --> 00:01:21,37
and their

217
00:01:21,37 --> 00:01:21,848
speech shall whisper out of the dust.

218
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:21,8
17 For thus

219
00:01:21,8 --> 00:01:21,752
saith the

220
00:01:21,752 --> 00:01:21,704
Lord God:

221
00:01:21,704 --> 00:01:21,656
They shall

222
00:01:21,656 --> 00:01:21,608
write the

223
00:01:21,608 --> 00:01:21,56
things which

224
00:01:21,56 --> 00:01:21,512
shall be

225
00:01:21,512 --> 00:01:21,464
done among

226
00:01:21,464 --> 00:01:21,416
them, and

227
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:21,368
they shall be

228
00:01:21,368 --> 00:01:21,32
written and

229
00:01:21,32 --> 00:01:21,272
sealed up

230
00:01:21,272 --> 00:01:21,224
in a book,

231
00:01:21,224 --> 00:01:21,176
and those

232
00:01:21,176 --> 00:01:21,128
who have

233
00:01:21,128 --> 00:01:21,08
dwindled in

234
00:01:21,08 --> 00:01:21,032
unbelief

235
00:01:21,032 --> 00:01:20,984
shall not have

236
00:01:20,984 --> 00:01:20,936
them, for

237
00:01:20,936 --> 00:01:20,888
they seek to

238
00:01:20,888 --> 00:01:20,914
destroy the things of God.

239
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:20,914
18

240
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:20,914
Wherefore, as those

241
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:20,914
who have

242
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:20,914
been

243
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:20,914
destroyed have

244
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:20,914
been destroyed

245
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:20,914
speedily;

246
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:20,914
and the

247
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:20,914
multitude of

248
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:20,914
their

249
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:20,914
terrible ones

250
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:20,914
shall be as

251
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:20,914
chaff that

252
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:20,914
passeth

253
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:20,914
away—yea, thus

254
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:20,914
saith the

255
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:20,914
Lord God: It

256
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:20,914
shall be at

257
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:20,914
an

258
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:20,447
instant, suddenly—

259
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:20,72
19 And it

260
00:01:20,72 --> 00:01:20,993
shall come

261
00:01:20,993 --> 00:01:21,266
to pass,

262
00:01:21,266 --> 00:01:21,539
that those

263
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:21,812
who have

264
00:01:21,812 --> 00:01:22,085
dwindled

265
00:01:22,085 --> 00:01:22,358
in unbelief

266
00:01:22,358 --> 00:01:22,631
shall be

267
00:01:22,631 --> 00:01:22,904
smitten by

268
00:01:22,904 --> 00:01:23,177
the hand

269
00:01:23,177 --> 00:01:23,45
of the Gentiles.

270
00:01:23,45 --> 00:01:24,033
20 And the

271
00:01:24,033 --> 00:01:24,616
Gentiles

272
00:01:24,616 --> 00:01:25,199
are lifted

273
00:01:25,199 --> 00:01:25,782
up in the

274
00:01:25,782 --> 00:01:26,365
pride of

275
00:01:26,365 --> 00:01:26,948
their

276
00:01:26,948 --> 00:01:27,531
eyes, and have

277
00:01:27,531 --> 00:01:28,114
stumbled,

278
00:01:28,114 --> 00:01:28,697
because

279
00:01:28,697 --> 00:01:29,28
of the

280
00:01:29,28 --> 00:01:29,863
greatness of

281
00:01:29,863 --> 00:01:30,446
their

282
00:01:30,446 --> 00:01:31,029
stumbling

283
00:01:31,029 --> 00:01:31,612
block, that

284
00:01:31,612 --> 00:01:32,195
they have

285
00:01:32,195 --> 00:01:32,778
built up many

286
00:01:32,778 --> 00:01:33,361
churches;

287
00:01:33,361 --> 00:01:33,944


288
00:01:33,944 --> 00:01:34,527
nevertheless, they

289
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:35,11
put down

290
00:01:35,11 --> 00:01:35,693
the power

291
00:01:35,693 --> 00:01:36,276
and

292
00:01:36,276 --> 00:01:36,859
miracles of God,

293
00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:37,442
and preach

294
00:01:37,442 --> 00:01:38,025
up unto

295
00:01:38,025 --> 00:01:38,608
themselves

296
00:01:38,608 --> 00:01:39,191
their own

297
00:01:39,191 --> 00:01:39,774
wisdom and

298
00:01:39,774 --> 00:01:40,357
their own

299
00:01:40,357 --> 00:01:40,94
learning,

300
00:01:40,94 --> 00:01:41,523
that they

301
00:01:41,523 --> 00:01:42,106
may get

302
00:01:42,106 --> 00:01:42,689
gain and

303
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:43,272
grind upon

304
00:01:43,272 --> 00:01:43,855
the face of

305
00:01:43,855 --> 00:01:44,304
the poor.

306
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:46,193
21 And

307
00:01:46,193 --> 00:01:48,082
there are

308
00:01:48,082 --> 00:01:49,971
many

309
00:01:49,971 --> 00:01:51,86
churches built

310
00:01:51,86 --> 00:01:53,749
up which

311
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:55,638
cause

312
00:01:55,638 --> 00:01:57,527
envyings,

313
00:01:57,527 --> 00:01:59,416
and

314
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:01,688
strifes, and malice.

315
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:02,002
22 And

316
00:02:02,002 --> 00:02:02,316
there are

317
00:02:02,316 --> 00:02:02,63

318
00:02:02,63 --> 00:02:02,944
secret

319
00:02:02,944 --> 00:02:03,258
combinations,

320
00:02:03,258 --> 00:02:03,572
even as in

321
00:02:03,572 --> 00:02:03,886
times of

322
00:02:03,886 --> 00:02:04,2
old,

323
00:02:04,2 --> 00:02:04,514
according to

324
00:02:04,514 --> 00:02:04,828
the

325
00:02:04,828 --> 00:02:05,142
combinations

326
00:02:05,142 --> 00:02:05,456
of the

327
00:02:05,456 --> 00:02:05,77
devil, for

328
00:02:05,77 --> 00:02:06,084
he is the

329
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:06,398
founder

330
00:02:06,398 --> 00:02:06,712
of all

331
00:02:06,712 --> 00:02:07,026
these

332
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:07,34
things; yea,

333
00:02:07,34 --> 00:02:07,654
the founder

334
00:02:07,654 --> 00:02:07,968
of

335
00:02:07,968 --> 00:02:08,282
murder, and

336
00:02:08,282 --> 00:02:08,596
works of

337
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:08,91
darkness;

338
00:02:08,91 --> 00:02:09,224
yea, and

339
00:02:09,224 --> 00:02:09,538
he leadeth

340
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:09,852
them by

341
00:02:09,852 --> 00:02:10,166
the neck

342
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:10,48
with a

343
00:02:10,48 --> 00:02:10,794
flaxen

344
00:02:10,794 --> 00:02:11,108
cord, until

345
00:02:11,108 --> 00:02:11,422
he bindeth

346
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:11,736
them

347
00:02:11,736 --> 00:02:12,05
with his

348
00:02:12,05 --> 00:02:12,364
strong cords

349
00:02:12,364 --> 00:02:12,032
forever.

350
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:13,214
23 For

351
00:02:13,214 --> 00:02:14,396
behold,

352
00:02:14,396 --> 00:02:15,578
my

353
00:02:15,578 --> 00:02:16,76
beloved

354
00:02:16,76 --> 00:02:17,942
brethren, I

355
00:02:17,942 --> 00:02:19,124
say unto

356
00:02:19,124 --> 00:02:20,306
you that

357
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,488
the Lord

358
00:02:21,488 --> 00:02:22,67
God

359
00:02:22,67 --> 00:02:23,852
worketh not

360
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,846
in darkness.

361
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:26,613
24 He

362
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:27,38
doeth

363
00:02:27,38 --> 00:02:28,147
not

364
00:02:28,147 --> 00:02:28,914
anything

365
00:02:28,914 --> 00:02:29,681
save it be

366
00:02:29,681 --> 00:02:30,448
for

367
00:02:30,448 --> 00:02:31,215
the

368
00:02:31,215 --> 00:02:31,982
benefit of

369
00:02:31,982 --> 00:02:32,749
the

370
00:02:32,749 --> 00:02:33,516
world; for

371
00:02:33,516 --> 00:02:34,283
he

372
00:02:34,283 --> 00:02:35,05
loveth the

373
00:02:35,05 --> 00:02:35,817
world,

374
00:02:35,817 --> 00:02:36,584
even

375
00:02:36,584 --> 00:02:37,351
that he

376
00:02:37,351 --> 00:02:38,118
layeth

377
00:02:38,118 --> 00:02:38,885
down his

378
00:02:38,885 --> 00:02:39,652
own

379
00:02:39,652 --> 00:02:40,419
life that

380
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:41,186
he may

381
00:02:41,186 --> 00:02:41,953
draw

382
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:42,72
all men

383
00:02:42,72 --> 00:02:43,487
unto

384
00:02:43,487 --> 00:02:44,254
him.

385
00:02:44,254 --> 00:02:45,021
Wherefore,

386
00:02:45,021 --> 00:02:45,788
he

387
00:02:45,788 --> 00:02:46,555
commandeth

388
00:02:46,555 --> 00:02:47,322
none

389
00:02:47,322 --> 00:02:48,089
that they

390
00:02:48,089 --> 00:02:48,835
shall not partake of his salvation.

391
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:48,799
25

392
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:48,763
Behold,

393
00:02:48,763 --> 00:02:48,727
doth he

394
00:02:48,727 --> 00:02:48,691
cry

395
00:02:48,691 --> 00:02:48,655
unto

396
00:02:48,655 --> 00:02:48,619
any,

397
00:02:48,619 --> 00:02:48,583
saying:

398
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:48,547
Depart

399
00:02:48,547 --> 00:02:48,511
from

400
00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:48,475
me?

401
00:02:48,475 --> 00:02:48,439
Behold, I

402
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:48,403
say

403
00:02:48,403 --> 00:02:48,367
unto

404
00:02:48,367 --> 00:02:48,331
you,

405
00:02:48,331 --> 00:02:48,295
Nay; but

406
00:02:48,295 --> 00:02:48,259
he

407
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:48,223
saith:

408
00:02:48,223 --> 00:02:48,187
Come

409
00:02:48,187 --> 00:02:48,151
unto me
