00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:03,4
Chapter 16 Isaiah sees the Lord—Isaiah’s

2
00:00:03,4 --> 00:00:06,8
sins are forgiven—He is called to

3
00:00:06,8 --> 00:00:10,2
prophesy—He prophesies of the rejection by the

4
00:00:10,2 --> 00:00:13,6
Jews of Christ’s teachings—A remnant will

5
00:00:13,6 --> 00:00:17,384
return—Compare 
Isaiah 6. About 559–545 B.C. 

6
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:20,384
1 In the year that king Uzziah

7
00:00:20,384 --> 00:00:23,384
died, I saw also the Lord sitting

8
00:00:23,384 --> 00:00:26,384
upon a throne, high and lifted up,

9
00:00:26,384 --> 00:00:29,763
and his train filled the temple.

10
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:32,363
2 Above it stood the

11
00:00:32,363 --> 00:00:34,963
seraphim; each one had six wings;

12
00:00:34,963 --> 00:00:37,563
with twain he covered his face,

13
00:00:37,563 --> 00:00:40,163
and with twain he covered his

14
00:00:40,163 --> 00:00:42,643
feet, and with twain he did fly.

15
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:44,443
3 And one cried unto

16
00:00:44,443 --> 00:00:46,243
another, and said: Holy,

17
00:00:46,243 --> 00:00:48,043
holy, holy, is the Lord

18
00:00:48,043 --> 00:00:49,843
of Hosts; the whole

19
00:00:49,843 --> 00:00:51,084
earth is full of his glory.

20
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:50,884
4 And the posts of

21
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:50,684
the door moved at the

22
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:50,484
voice of him that

23
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:50,284
cried, and the house

24
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:50,15
was filled with smoke.

25
00:00:50,15 --> 00:00:50,05
5 Then said I: Wo

26
00:00:50,05 --> 00:00:49,95
is unto me! for I

27
00:00:49,95 --> 00:00:49,85
am undone; because

28
00:00:49,85 --> 00:00:49,75
I am a man of

29
00:00:49,75 --> 00:00:49,65
unclean lips; and I

30
00:00:49,65 --> 00:00:49,55
dwell in the midst

31
00:00:49,55 --> 00:00:49,45
of a people of

32
00:00:49,45 --> 00:00:49,35
unclean lips; for

33
00:00:49,35 --> 00:00:49,25
mine eyes have seen

34
00:00:49,25 --> 00:00:49,216
the King, the Lord of Hosts.

35
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:49,073
6 Then flew one of

36
00:00:49,073 --> 00:00:48,93
the seraphim unto

37
00:00:48,93 --> 00:00:48,787
me, having a live

38
00:00:48,787 --> 00:00:48,644
coal in his hand,

39
00:00:48,644 --> 00:00:48,501
which he had

40
00:00:48,501 --> 00:00:48,358
taken with the tongs

41
00:00:48,358 --> 00:00:48,749
from off the altar;

42
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:49,463
7 And he laid it

43
00:00:49,463 --> 00:00:50,177
upon my mouth, and

44
00:00:50,177 --> 00:00:50,891
said: Lo, this has

45
00:00:50,891 --> 00:00:51,605
touched thy lips;

46
00:00:51,605 --> 00:00:52,319
and thine

47
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:53,033
iniquity is taken away,

48
00:00:53,033 --> 00:00:53,153
and thy sin purged.

49
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:53,01
8 Also I heard

50
00:00:53,01 --> 00:00:52,867
the voice of the

51
00:00:52,867 --> 00:00:52,724
Lord, saying: Whom

52
00:00:52,724 --> 00:00:52,581
shall I send, and

53
00:00:52,581 --> 00:00:52,438
who will go for

54
00:00:52,438 --> 00:00:52,295
us? Then I said:

55
00:00:52,295 --> 00:00:52,219
Here am I; send me.

56
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:52,969
9 And he said:

57
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:53,719
Go and tell

58
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:54,469
this people—Hear

59
00:00:54,469 --> 00:00:55,219
ye indeed, but

60
00:00:55,219 --> 00:00:55,969
they understood

61
00:00:55,969 --> 00:00:56,719
not; and see ye

62
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:57,469
indeed, but

63
00:00:57,469 --> 00:00:58,559
they perceived not.

64
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,702
10 Make the

65
00:00:59,702 --> 00:01:00,845
heart of this

66
00:01:00,845 --> 00:01:01,988
people fat, and

67
00:01:01,988 --> 00:01:03,131
make their

68
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:04,273
ears heavy, and

69
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:05,416
shut their

70
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:06,559
eyes—lest they see

71
00:01:06,559 --> 00:01:07,703
with their

72
00:01:07,703 --> 00:01:08,846
eyes, and hear

73
00:01:08,846 --> 00:01:09,989
with their

74
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:11,132
ears, and

75
00:01:11,132 --> 00:01:12,275
understand with their

76
00:01:12,275 --> 00:01:13,418
heart, and be

77
00:01:13,418 --> 00:01:14,041
converted and be healed.

78
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:14,223
11 Then said

79
00:01:14,223 --> 00:01:14,405
I: Lord, how

80
00:01:14,405 --> 00:01:14,587
long? And he

81
00:01:14,587 --> 00:01:14,769
said: Until

82
00:01:14,769 --> 00:01:14,951
the cities be

83
00:01:14,951 --> 00:01:15,133
wasted

84
00:01:15,133 --> 00:01:15,315
without inhabitant,

85
00:01:15,315 --> 00:01:15,497
and the

86
00:01:15,497 --> 00:01:15,679
houses without

87
00:01:15,679 --> 00:01:15,861
man, and the

88
00:01:15,861 --> 00:01:16,443
land be utterly desolate;

89
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:16,665
12 And the

90
00:01:16,665 --> 00:01:16,887
Lord have

91
00:01:16,887 --> 00:01:17,109
removed men

92
00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:17,331
far away,

93
00:01:17,331 --> 00:01:17,553
for there

94
00:01:17,553 --> 00:01:17,775
shall be a

95
00:01:17,775 --> 00:01:17,997
great

96
00:01:17,997 --> 00:01:18,219
forsaking in the

97
00:01:18,219 --> 00:01:18,378
midst of the land.

98
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:18,328
13 But yet

99
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:18,278
there

100
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:18,228
shall be a

101
00:01:18,228 --> 00:01:18,178
tenth, and

102
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:18,128
they shall

103
00:01:18,128 --> 00:01:18,078
return,

104
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:18,028
and shall be

105
00:01:18,028 --> 00:01:17,978
eaten, as

106
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:17,928
a teil

107
00:01:17,928 --> 00:01:17,878
tree, and as

108
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:17,828
an oak

109
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:17,778
whose

110
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:17,728
substance is in

111
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:17,678
them when

112
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:17,628
they cast

113
00:01:17,628 --> 00:01:17,578
their

114
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:17,528
leaves; so the

115
00:01:17,528 --> 00:01:17,478
holy seed

116
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:17,428
shall be

117
00:01:17,428 --> 00:01:17,444
the substance thereof.
