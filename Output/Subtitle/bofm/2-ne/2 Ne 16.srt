Chapter 16 Isaiah sees the Lord—Isaiah’s sins are

2
00:00:01,4 --> 00:00:02,8
 forgiven—He is called to prophesy—He prophesies of

3
00:00:02,8 --> 00:00:04,2
 the rejection by the Jews of Christ’s teachings—A

4
00:00:04,2 --> 00:00:05,6
 remnant will return—Compare 
Isaiah 6. About

6
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:10,642
1 In the year that king Uzziah died, I saw also

7
00:00:10,642 --> 00:00:13,309
 the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up,

8
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:15,976
 and his train filled the temple

9
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,616
2 Above it stood the seraphim; each one had six

10
00:00:18,616 --> 00:00:21,283
 wings; with twain he covered his face, and with

11
00:00:21,283 --> 00:00:23,95
 twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly

12
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:26,591
3 And one cried unto another, and said: Holy,

13
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:29,258
 holy, holy, is the Lord of Hosts; the whole earth is

14
00:00:29,258 --> 00:00:31,925
 full of his glory

15
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:34,566
4 And the posts of the door moved at the voice of

16
00:00:34,566 --> 00:00:37,233
 him that cried, and the house was filled with

17
00:00:37,233 --> 00:00:39,9
 smoke

18
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,873
5 Then said I: Wo is unto me! for I am undone;

19
00:00:41,873 --> 00:00:43,873
 because I am a man of unclean lips; and I dwell in

20
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:45,873
 the midst of a people of unclean lips; for mine eyes

21
00:00:45,873 --> 00:00:47,873
 have seen the King, the Lord of Hosts

22
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:50,515
6 Then flew one of the seraphim unto me, having a

23
00:00:50,515 --> 00:00:53,182
 live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the

24
00:00:53,182 --> 00:00:55,849
 tongs from off the altar

25
00:00:55,822 --> 00:02:10,489
7 And he laid it upon my mouth, and said: Lo, this

26
00:02:10,489 --> 00:03:25,156
 has touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken

27
00:03:25,156 --> 00:04:39,823
 away, and thy sin purged

28
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:54,779
8 Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying: Whom

29
00:04:54,779 --> 00:05:10,446
 shall I send, and who will go for us? Then I

30
00:05:10,446 --> 00:05:26,113
 said: Here am I; send me

31
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,975
11 Then said I: Lord, how long? And he said: Until

32
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:11,975
 the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the

33
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:13,975
 houses without man, and the land be utterly

34
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:15,975
 desolate

35
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,616
12 And the Lord have removed men far away, for

36
00:00:18,616 --> 00:00:21,283
 there shall be a great forsaking in the midst of the

37
00:00:21,283 --> 00:00:23,95
 land

38
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,524
13 But yet there shall be a tenth, and they shall

39
00:00:25,524 --> 00:00:27,124
 return, and shall be eaten, as a teil tree, and as

40
00:00:27,124 --> 00:00:28,724
 an oak whose substance is in them when they cast

41
00:00:28,724 --> 00:00:30,324
 their leaves; so the holy seed shall be the

42
00:00:30,324 --> 00:00:31,924
 substance thereof.
