00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 16 Isaiah sees the Lord—Isaiah’s

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
sins are forgiven—He is called to

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
prophesy—He prophesies of the rejection by the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Jews of Christ’s teachings—A remnant will

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:04:43,
return—Compare 
Isaiah 6. About 559–545 B.C. 

6
00:04:43,0 --> 00:04:43,0
1 In the year that king Uzziah

7
00:04:43,0 --> 00:04:43,0
died, I saw also the Lord sitting

8
00:04:43,0 --> 00:04:43,0
upon a throne, high and lifted up,

9
00:04:43,0 --> 00:06:13,
and his train filled the temple.

10
00:06:13,0 --> 00:06:13,0
2 Above it stood the

11
00:06:13,0 --> 00:06:13,0
seraphim; each one had six wings;

12
00:06:13,0 --> 00:06:13,0
with twain he covered his face,

13
00:06:13,0 --> 00:06:13,0
and with twain he covered his

14
00:06:13,0 --> 00:13:42,
feet, and with twain he did fly.

15
00:13:42,0 --> 00:13:42,0
3 And one cried unto

16
00:13:42,0 --> 00:13:42,0
another, and said: Holy,

17
00:13:42,0 --> 00:13:42,0
holy, holy, is the Lord

18
00:13:42,0 --> 00:13:42,0
of Hosts; the whole

19
00:13:42,0 --> 00:13:14,
earth is full of his glory.

20
00:13:14,0 --> 00:13:14,0
4 And the posts of

21
00:13:14,0 --> 00:13:14,0
the door moved at the

22
00:13:14,0 --> 00:13:14,0
voice of him that

23
00:13:14,0 --> 00:13:14,0
cried, and the house

24
00:13:14,0 --> 00:23:39,
was filled with smoke.

25
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
5 Then said I: Wo

26
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
is unto me! for I

27
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
am undone; because

28
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
I am a man of

29
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
unclean lips; and I

30
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
dwell in the midst

31
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
of a people of

32
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
unclean lips; for

33
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
mine eyes have seen

34
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,
the King, the Lord of Hosts.

35
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
6 Then flew one of

36
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
the seraphim unto

37
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
me, having a live

38
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
coal in his hand,

39
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
which he had

40
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
taken with the tongs

41
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,
from off the altar;

42
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
7 And he laid it

43
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
upon my mouth, and

44
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
said: Lo, this has

45
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
touched thy lips;

46
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
and thine

47
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
iniquity is taken away,

48
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,
and thy sin purged.

49
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
8 Also I heard

50
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
the voice of the

51
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
Lord, saying: Whom

52
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
shall I send, and

53
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
who will go for

54
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
us? Then I said:

55
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,
Here am I; send me.

56
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
9 And he said:

57
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
Go and tell

58
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
this people—Hear

59
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
ye indeed, but

60
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
they understood

61
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
not; and see ye

62
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
indeed, but

63
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,
they perceived not.

64
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
10 Make the

65
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
heart of this

66
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
people fat, and

67
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
make their

68
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
ears heavy, and

69
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
shut their

70
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
eyes—lest they see

71
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
with their

72
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
eyes, and hear

73
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
with their

74
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
ears, and

75
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
understand with their

76
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
heart, and be

77
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,
converted and be healed.

78
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
11 Then said

79
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
I: Lord, how

80
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
long? And he

81
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
said: Until

82
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
the cities be

83
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
wasted

84
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
without inhabitant,

85
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
and the

86
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
houses without

87
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
man, and the

88
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,
land be utterly desolate;

89
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
12 And the

90
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
Lord have

91
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
removed men

92
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
far away,

93
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
for there

94
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
shall be a

95
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
great

96
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
forsaking in the

97
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,
midst of the land.

98
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
13 But yet

99
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
there

100
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
shall be a

101
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
tenth, and

102
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
they shall

103
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
return,

104
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
and shall be

105
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
eaten, as

106
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
a teil

107
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
tree, and as

108
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
an oak

109
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
whose

110
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
substance is in

111
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
them when

112
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
they cast

113
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
their

114
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
leaves; so the

115
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
holy seed

116
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,0
shall be

117
00:23:39,0 --> 00:23:39,
the substance thereof.
