00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:06,0
Chapter 21 The stem of Jesse (Christ) will

2
00:00:06,0 --> 00:00:12,0
judge in righteousness—The knowledge of

3
00:00:12,0 --> 00:00:18,0
God will cover the earth in the

4
00:00:18,0 --> 00:00:24,0
Millennium—The Lord will raise an ensign and gather

5
00:00:24,0 --> 00:00:30,23
Israel—Compare 
Isaiah 11. About 559–545 B.C. 

6
00:00:30,23 --> 00:00:33,563
1 And there shall come forth a rod

7
00:00:33,563 --> 00:00:36,896
out of the stem of Jesse, and a

8
00:00:36,896 --> 00:00:40,574
branch shall grow out of his roots.

9
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:42,574
2 And the Spirit of the Lord

10
00:00:42,574 --> 00:00:44,574
shall rest upon him, the

11
00:00:44,574 --> 00:00:46,574
spirit of wisdom and

12
00:00:46,574 --> 00:00:48,574
understanding, the spirit of counsel and

13
00:00:48,574 --> 00:00:50,574
might, the spirit of

14
00:00:50,574 --> 00:00:52,019
knowledge and of the fear of the Lord;

15
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:51,852
3 And shall make him of

16
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:51,685
quick understanding in the

17
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:51,518
fear of the Lord; and he shall

18
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:51,351
not judge after the sight

19
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,184
of his eyes, neither

20
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:51,084
reprove after the hearing of his ears.

21
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:50,959
4 But with righteousness

22
00:00:50,959 --> 00:00:50,834
shall he judge the poor,

23
00:00:50,834 --> 00:00:50,709
and reprove with equity for

24
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:50,584
the meek of the earth; and

25
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:50,459
he shall smite the earth

26
00:00:50,459 --> 00:00:50,334
with the rod of his mouth,

27
00:00:50,334 --> 00:00:50,209
and with the breath of

28
00:00:50,209 --> 00:00:50,15
his lips shall he slay the wicked.

29
00:00:50,15 --> 00:00:49,9
5 And righteousness

30
00:00:49,9 --> 00:00:49,65
shall be the girdle of his

31
00:00:49,65 --> 00:00:49,4
loins, and

32
00:00:49,4 --> 00:00:49,683
faithfulness the girdle of his reins.

33
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
6 The wolf also shall

34
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
dwell with the lamb,

35
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
and the leopard shall

36
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
lie down with the kid,

37
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
and the calf and the

38
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
young lion and fatling

39
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
together; and a little

40
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
child shall lead them.

41
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
7 And the cow and

42
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
the bear shall feed;

43
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
their young ones

44
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
shall lie down together;

45
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
and the lion shall

46
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
eat straw like the ox.

47
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
8 And the sucking

48
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
child shall play

49
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
on the hole of

50
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
the asp, and the

51
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
weaned child shall

52
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
put his hand on

53
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
the cockatrice’s den.

54
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
9 They shall not

55
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
hurt nor

56
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
destroy in all my holy

57
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
mountain, for

58
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
the earth shall

59
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
be full of the

60
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
knowledge of the

61
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
Lord, as the

62
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
waters cover the sea.

63
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
10 And in that

64
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
day there shall

65
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
be a root of

66
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
Jesse, which shall

67
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
stand for an

68
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
ensign of the

69
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
people; to it shall

70
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
the Gentiles seek;

71
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
and his rest

72
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
shall be glorious.

73
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
11 And it shall

74
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
come to pass

75
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
in that day that

76
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
the Lord shall

77
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
set his hand

78
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
again the second

79
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
time to

80
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
recover the remnant

81
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
of his people

82
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
which shall be

83
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
left, from

84
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
Assyria, and from

85
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
Egypt, and from

86
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
Pathros, and from

87
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
Cush, and from

88
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
Elam, and from

89
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
Shinar, and

90
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
from Hamath, and

91
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
from the islands of the sea.

92
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
12 And he

93
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
shall set up an

94
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
ensign for the

95
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
nations, and

96
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
shall assemble

97
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
the outcasts of

98
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
Israel, and

99
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
gather together

100
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
the dispersed

101
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
of Judah from

102
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
the four

103
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
corners of the earth.

104
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
13 The envy

105
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
of Ephraim

106
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
also shall

107
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
depart, and the

108
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
adversaries of

109
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
Judah shall

110
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
be cut off;

111
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
Ephraim shall

112
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
not envy

113
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
Judah, and Judah

114
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
shall not vex Ephraim.

115
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
14 But they

116
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
shall fly

117
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
upon the

118
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
shoulders of the

119
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
Philistines

120
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
towards the

121
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
west; they

122
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
shall spoil

123
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
them of the

124
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
east

125
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
together; they shall

126
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
lay their

127
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
hand upon

128
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
Edom and Moab;

129
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
and the

130
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
children of

131
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
Ammon shall obey them.

132
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
15 And the

133
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
Lord shall

134
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
utterly

135
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
destroy the

136
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
tongue of the

137
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
Egyptian

138
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
sea; and

139
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
with his

140
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
mighty wind he

141
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
shall shake

142
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
his hand

143
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
over the

144
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
river, and

145
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
shall smite it

146
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
in the

147
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
seven streams,

148
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
and make

149
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
men go over dry shod.

150
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
16 And

151
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
there shall

152
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
be a

153
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
highway for the

154
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
remnant of

155
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
his

156
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
people which

157
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
shall be

158
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
left, from

159
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
Assyria,

160
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
like as it

161
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
was to

162
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
Israel in the

163
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
day that he

164
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
came up

165
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:49,683
out of the land of Egypt.
