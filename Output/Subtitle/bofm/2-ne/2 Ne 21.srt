00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,4
Chapter 21 The stem of Jesse (Christ) will judge

2
00:00:01,4 --> 00:00:02,8
 in righteousness—The knowledge of God will cover

3
00:00:02,8 --> 00:00:04,2
 the earth in the Millennium—The Lord will raise an

4
00:00:04,2 --> 00:00:05,6
 ensign and gather Israel—Compare 
Isaiah 11. About

5
00:00:05,6 --> 00:00:07,0
 559–545 B.C.

6
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:10,642
1 And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem

7
00:00:10,642 --> 00:00:13,309
 of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his

8
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:15,976
 roots

9
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,949
2 And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him,

10
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:19,949
 the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit

11
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:21,949
 of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and

12
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:23,949
 of the fear of the Lord

13
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,924
3 And shall make him of quick understanding in the

14
00:00:25,924 --> 00:00:27,924
 fear of the Lord; and he shall not judge after

15
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:29,924
 the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the

16
00:00:29,924 --> 00:00:31,924
 hearing of his ears

17
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,499
4 But with righteousness shall he judge the poor,

18
00:00:33,499 --> 00:00:35,099
 and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth;

19
00:00:35,099 --> 00:00:36,699
 and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his

20
00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:38,299
 mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he

21
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:39,899
 slay the wicked

22
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:43,873
5 And righteousness shall be the girdle of his

23
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:47,873
 loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins

24
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:53,848
6 The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the

25
00:00:53,848 --> 00:00:59,848
 leopard shall lie down with the kid, and the calf

26
00:00:59,848 --> 00:01:05,848
 and the young lion and fatling together; and a

27
00:01:05,848 --> 00:01:11,848
 little child shall lead them

28
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:14,439
7 And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young

29
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:17,106
 ones shall lie down together; and the lion shall

30
00:01:17,106 --> 00:01:19,773
 eat straw like the ox

31
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:30,413
8 And the sucking child shall play on the hole of

32
00:01:30,413 --> 00:01:41,08
 the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand

33
00:01:41,08 --> 00:01:51,747
 on the cockatrice’s den

34
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:54,312
9 They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy

35
00:01:54,312 --> 00:01:56,979
 mountain, for the earth shall be full of the

36
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:59,646
 knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea

37
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:03,62
10 And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse,

38
00:02:03,62 --> 00:02:07,62
 which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to

39
00:02:07,62 --> 00:02:11,62
 it shall the Gentiles seek; and his rest shall be

40
00:02:11,62 --> 00:02:15,62
 glorious

41
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:18,236
11 And it shall come to pass in that day that the

42
00:02:18,236 --> 00:02:20,903
 Lord shall set his hand again the second time to

43
00:02:20,903 --> 00:02:23,57
 recover the remnant of his people which shall be

44
00:02:23,57 --> 00:02:26,237
 left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from

45
00:02:26,237 --> 00:02:28,904
 Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar,

46
00:02:28,904 --> 00:02:31,571
 and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea

47
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:39,518
12 And he shall set up an ensign for the nations,

48
00:02:39,518 --> 00:02:47,518
 and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and

49
00:02:47,518 --> 00:02:55,518
 gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four

50
00:02:55,518 --> 00:03:03,518
 corners of the earth

51
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,417
13 The envy of Ephraim also shall depart, and the

52
00:03:05,417 --> 00:03:07,417
 adversaries of Judah shall be cut off; Ephraim

53
00:03:07,417 --> 00:03:09,417
 shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex

54
00:03:09,417 --> 00:03:11,417
 Ephraim

55
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:12,991
14 But they shall fly upon the shoulders of the

56
00:03:12,991 --> 00:03:14,591
 Philistines towards the west; they shall spoil them

57
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:16,191
 of the east together; they shall lay their hand

58
00:03:16,191 --> 00:03:17,791
 upon Edom and Moab; and the children of Ammon shall

59
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,391
 obey them

60
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,966
15 And the Lord shall utterly destroy the tongue

61
00:03:20,966 --> 00:03:22,566
 of the Egyptian sea; and with his mighty wind he

62
00:03:22,566 --> 00:03:24,166
 shall shake his hand over the river, and shall smite

63
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,766
 it in the seven streams, and make men go over dry

64
00:03:25,766 --> 00:03:27,366
 shod

65
00:03:27,34 --> 00:03:27,59
16 And there shall be a highway for the remnant of

66
00:03:27,59 --> 00:03:27,84
 his people which shall be left, from Assyria,

67
00:03:27,84 --> 00:03:28,09
 like as it was to Israel in the day that he came up

68
00:03:28,09 --> 00:03:28,34
 out of the land of Egypt.
