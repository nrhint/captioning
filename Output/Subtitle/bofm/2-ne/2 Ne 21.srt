00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 21 The stem of Jesse (Christ) will

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
judge in righteousness—The knowledge of

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
God will cover the earth in the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Millennium—The Lord will raise an ensign and gather

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:08:56,
Israel—Compare 
Isaiah 11. About 559–545 B.C. 

6
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
1 And there shall come forth a rod

7
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
out of the stem of Jesse, and a

8
00:08:56,0 --> 00:25:49,
branch shall grow out of his roots.

9
00:25:49,0 --> 00:25:49,0
2 And the Spirit of the Lord

10
00:25:49,0 --> 00:25:49,0
shall rest upon him, the

11
00:25:49,0 --> 00:25:49,0
spirit of wisdom and

12
00:25:49,0 --> 00:25:49,0
understanding, the spirit of counsel and

13
00:25:49,0 --> 00:25:49,0
might, the spirit of

14
00:25:49,0 --> 00:25:21,
knowledge and of the fear of the Lord;

15
00:25:21,0 --> 00:25:21,0
3 And shall make him of

16
00:25:21,0 --> 00:25:21,0
quick understanding in the

17
00:25:21,0 --> 00:25:21,0
fear of the Lord; and he shall

18
00:25:21,0 --> 00:25:21,0
not judge after the sight

19
00:25:21,0 --> 00:25:21,0
of his eyes, neither

20
00:25:21,0 --> 00:24:53,
reprove after the hearing of his ears.

21
00:24:53,0 --> 00:24:53,0
4 But with righteousness

22
00:24:53,0 --> 00:24:53,0
shall he judge the poor,

23
00:24:53,0 --> 00:24:53,0
and reprove with equity for

24
00:24:53,0 --> 00:24:53,0
the meek of the earth; and

25
00:24:53,0 --> 00:24:53,0
he shall smite the earth

26
00:24:53,0 --> 00:24:53,0
with the rod of his mouth,

27
00:24:53,0 --> 00:24:53,0
and with the breath of

28
00:24:53,0 --> 00:24:39,
his lips shall he slay the wicked.

29
00:24:39,0 --> 00:24:39,0
5 And righteousness

30
00:24:39,0 --> 00:24:39,0
shall be the girdle of his

31
00:24:39,0 --> 00:24:39,0
loins, and

32
00:24:39,0 --> 00:24:25,
faithfulness the girdle of his reins.

33
00:24:25,0 --> 00:24:25,0
6 The wolf also shall

34
00:24:25,0 --> 00:24:25,0
dwell with the lamb,

35
00:24:25,0 --> 00:24:25,0
and the leopard shall

36
00:24:25,0 --> 00:24:25,0
lie down with the kid,

37
00:24:25,0 --> 00:24:25,0
and the calf and the

38
00:24:25,0 --> 00:24:25,0
young lion and fatling

39
00:24:25,0 --> 00:24:25,0
together; and a little

40
00:24:25,0 --> 00:25:55,
child shall lead them.

41
00:25:55,0 --> 00:25:55,0
7 And the cow and

42
00:25:55,0 --> 00:25:55,0
the bear shall feed;

43
00:25:55,0 --> 00:25:55,0
their young ones

44
00:25:55,0 --> 00:25:55,0
shall lie down together;

45
00:25:55,0 --> 00:25:55,0
and the lion shall

46
00:25:55,0 --> 00:25:27,
eat straw like the ox.

47
00:25:27,0 --> 00:25:27,0
8 And the sucking

48
00:25:27,0 --> 00:25:27,0
child shall play

49
00:25:27,0 --> 00:25:27,0
on the hole of

50
00:25:27,0 --> 00:25:27,0
the asp, and the

51
00:25:27,0 --> 00:25:27,0
weaned child shall

52
00:25:27,0 --> 00:25:27,0
put his hand on

53
00:25:27,0 --> 00:24:59,
the cockatrice’s den.

54
00:24:59,0 --> 00:24:59,0
9 They shall not

55
00:24:59,0 --> 00:24:59,0
hurt nor

56
00:24:59,0 --> 00:24:59,0
destroy in all my holy

57
00:24:59,0 --> 00:24:59,0
mountain, for

58
00:24:59,0 --> 00:24:59,0
the earth shall

59
00:24:59,0 --> 00:24:59,0
be full of the

60
00:24:59,0 --> 00:24:59,0
knowledge of the

61
00:24:59,0 --> 00:24:59,0
Lord, as the

62
00:24:59,0 --> 00:24:45,
waters cover the sea.

63
00:24:45,0 --> 00:24:45,0
10 And in that

64
00:24:45,0 --> 00:24:45,0
day there shall

65
00:24:45,0 --> 00:24:45,0
be a root of

66
00:24:45,0 --> 00:24:45,0
Jesse, which shall

67
00:24:45,0 --> 00:24:45,0
stand for an

68
00:24:45,0 --> 00:24:45,0
ensign of the

69
00:24:45,0 --> 00:24:45,0
people; to it shall

70
00:24:45,0 --> 00:24:45,0
the Gentiles seek;

71
00:24:45,0 --> 00:24:45,0
and his rest

72
00:24:45,0 --> 00:24:31,
shall be glorious.

73
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
11 And it shall

74
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
come to pass

75
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
in that day that

76
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
the Lord shall

77
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
set his hand

78
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
again the second

79
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
time to

80
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
recover the remnant

81
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
of his people

82
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
which shall be

83
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
left, from

84
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
Assyria, and from

85
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
Egypt, and from

86
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
Pathros, and from

87
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
Cush, and from

88
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
Elam, and from

89
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
Shinar, and

90
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
from Hamath, and

91
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:17,
from the islands of the sea.

92
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
12 And he

93
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
shall set up an

94
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
ensign for the

95
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
nations, and

96
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
shall assemble

97
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
the outcasts of

98
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
Israel, and

99
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
gather together

100
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
the dispersed

101
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
of Judah from

102
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
the four

103
00:24:17,0 --> 00:26:01,
corners of the earth.

104
00:26:01,0 --> 00:26:01,0
13 The envy

105
00:26:01,0 --> 00:26:01,0
of Ephraim

106
00:26:01,0 --> 00:26:01,0
also shall

107
00:26:01,0 --> 00:26:01,0
depart, and the

108
00:26:01,0 --> 00:26:01,0
adversaries of

109
00:26:01,0 --> 00:26:01,0
Judah shall

110
00:26:01,0 --> 00:26:01,0
be cut off;

111
00:26:01,0 --> 00:26:01,0
Ephraim shall

112
00:26:01,0 --> 00:26:01,0
not envy

113
00:26:01,0 --> 00:26:01,0
Judah, and Judah

114
00:26:01,0 --> 00:25:33,
shall not vex Ephraim.

115
00:25:33,0 --> 00:25:33,0
14 But they

116
00:25:33,0 --> 00:25:33,0
shall fly

117
00:25:33,0 --> 00:25:33,0
upon the

118
00:25:33,0 --> 00:25:33,0
shoulders of the

119
00:25:33,0 --> 00:25:33,0
Philistines

120
00:25:33,0 --> 00:25:33,0
towards the

121
00:25:33,0 --> 00:25:33,0
west; they

122
00:25:33,0 --> 00:25:33,0
shall spoil

123
00:25:33,0 --> 00:25:33,0
them of the

124
00:25:33,0 --> 00:25:33,0
east

125
00:25:33,0 --> 00:25:33,0
together; they shall

126
00:25:33,0 --> 00:25:33,0
lay their

127
00:25:33,0 --> 00:25:33,0
hand upon

128
00:25:33,0 --> 00:25:33,0
Edom and Moab;

129
00:25:33,0 --> 00:25:33,0
and the

130
00:25:33,0 --> 00:25:33,0
children of

131
00:25:33,0 --> 00:25:05,
Ammon shall obey them.

132
00:25:05,0 --> 00:25:05,0
15 And the

133
00:25:05,0 --> 00:25:05,0
Lord shall

134
00:25:05,0 --> 00:25:05,0
utterly

135
00:25:05,0 --> 00:25:05,0
destroy the

136
00:25:05,0 --> 00:25:05,0
tongue of the

137
00:25:05,0 --> 00:25:05,0
Egyptian

138
00:25:05,0 --> 00:25:05,0
sea; and

139
00:25:05,0 --> 00:25:05,0
with his

140
00:25:05,0 --> 00:25:05,0
mighty wind he

141
00:25:05,0 --> 00:25:05,0
shall shake

142
00:25:05,0 --> 00:25:05,0
his hand

143
00:25:05,0 --> 00:25:05,0
over the

144
00:25:05,0 --> 00:25:05,0
river, and

145
00:25:05,0 --> 00:25:05,0
shall smite it

146
00:25:05,0 --> 00:25:05,0
in the

147
00:25:05,0 --> 00:25:05,0
seven streams,

148
00:25:05,0 --> 00:25:05,0
and make

149
00:25:05,0 --> 00:24:37,
men go over dry shod.

150
00:24:37,0 --> 00:24:37,0
16 And

151
00:24:37,0 --> 00:24:37,0
there shall

152
00:24:37,0 --> 00:24:37,0
be a

153
00:24:37,0 --> 00:24:37,0
highway for the

154
00:24:37,0 --> 00:24:37,0
remnant of

155
00:24:37,0 --> 00:24:37,0
his

156
00:24:37,0 --> 00:24:37,0
people which

157
00:24:37,0 --> 00:24:37,0
shall be

158
00:24:37,0 --> 00:24:37,0
left, from

159
00:24:37,0 --> 00:24:37,0
Assyria,

160
00:24:37,0 --> 00:24:37,0
like as it

161
00:24:37,0 --> 00:24:37,0
was to

162
00:24:37,0 --> 00:24:37,0
Israel in the

163
00:24:37,0 --> 00:24:37,0
day that he

164
00:24:37,0 --> 00:24:37,0
came up

165
00:24:37,0 --> 00:24:23,
out of the land of Egypt.
