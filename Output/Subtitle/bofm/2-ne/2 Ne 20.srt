00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 20 The destruction of Assyria is a type

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of the destruction of the wicked at the Second

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Coming—Few people will be left after the Lord

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
comes again—The remnant of Jacob will return in

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:10:53,
that day—Compare 
Isaiah 10. About 559–545 B.C. 

6
00:10:53,0 --> 00:10:53,0
1 Wo unto them that decree

7
00:10:53,0 --> 00:10:53,0
unrighteous decrees, and that write

8
00:10:53,0 --> 00:14:38,
grievousness which they have prescribed;

9
00:14:38,0 --> 00:14:38,0
2 To turn away the needy from

10
00:14:38,0 --> 00:14:38,0
judgment, and to take away the

11
00:14:38,0 --> 00:14:38,0
right from the poor of my people,

12
00:14:38,0 --> 00:14:38,0
that widows may be their prey,

13
00:14:38,0 --> 00:27:47,
and that they may rob the fatherless!

14
00:27:47,0 --> 00:27:47,0
3 And what will ye do in

15
00:27:47,0 --> 00:27:47,0
the day of visitation, and in

16
00:27:47,0 --> 00:27:47,0
the desolation which shall

17
00:27:47,0 --> 00:27:47,0
come from far? to whom

18
00:27:47,0 --> 00:27:47,0
will ye flee for help? and

19
00:27:47,0 --> 00:35:17,
where will ye leave your glory?

20
00:35:17,0 --> 00:35:17,0
4 Without me they shall

21
00:35:17,0 --> 00:35:17,0
bow down under the

22
00:35:17,0 --> 00:35:17,0
prisoners, and they shall

23
00:35:17,0 --> 00:35:17,0
fall under the slain. For

24
00:35:17,0 --> 00:35:17,0
all this his anger is not

25
00:35:17,0 --> 00:35:17,0
turned away, but his

26
00:35:17,0 --> 00:40:00,
hand is stretched out still.

27
00:40:00,0 --> 00:40:00,0
5 O Assyrian, the rod

28
00:40:00,0 --> 00:40:00,0
of mine anger, and

29
00:40:00,0 --> 00:40:00,0
the staff in their

30
00:40:00,0 --> 00:42:12,
hand is their indignation.

31
00:42:12,0 --> 00:42:12,0
6 I will send him

32
00:42:12,0 --> 00:42:12,0
against a hypocritical

33
00:42:12,0 --> 00:42:12,0
nation, and against

34
00:42:12,0 --> 00:42:12,0
the people of my

35
00:42:12,0 --> 00:42:12,0
wrath will I give him

36
00:42:12,0 --> 00:42:12,0
a charge to take the

37
00:42:12,0 --> 00:42:12,0
spoil, and to take

38
00:42:12,0 --> 00:42:12,0
the prey, and to

39
00:42:12,0 --> 00:42:12,0
tread them down like

40
00:42:12,0 --> 00:50:24,
the mire of the streets.

41
00:50:24,0 --> 00:50:24,0
7 Howbeit he

42
00:50:24,0 --> 00:50:24,0
meaneth not so, neither

43
00:50:24,0 --> 00:50:24,0
doth his heart

44
00:50:24,0 --> 00:50:24,0
think so; but in his

45
00:50:24,0 --> 00:50:24,0
heart it is to

46
00:50:24,0 --> 00:50:24,0
destroy and cut off

47
00:50:24,0 --> 00:49:56,
nations not a few.

48
00:49:56,0 --> 00:49:56,0
8 For he saith:

49
00:49:56,0 --> 00:49:56,0
Are not my princes

50
00:49:56,0 --> 00:49:42,
altogether kings?

51
00:49:42,0 --> 00:49:42,0
9 Is not Calno

52
00:49:42,0 --> 00:49:42,0
as Carchemish? Is

53
00:49:42,0 --> 00:49:42,0
not Hamath as

54
00:49:42,0 --> 00:49:42,0
Arpad? Is not

55
00:49:42,0 --> 00:53:12,
Samaria as Damascus?

56
00:53:12,0 --> 00:53:12,0
10 As my hand

57
00:53:12,0 --> 00:53:12,0
hath founded the

58
00:53:12,0 --> 00:53:12,0
kingdoms of

59
00:53:12,0 --> 00:53:12,0
the idols, and

60
00:53:12,0 --> 00:53:12,0
whose graven

61
00:53:12,0 --> 00:53:12,0
images did excel

62
00:53:12,0 --> 00:53:12,0
them of Jerusalem

63
00:53:12,0 --> 00:52:44,
and of Samaria;

64
00:52:44,0 --> 00:52:44,0
11 Shall I

65
00:52:44,0 --> 00:52:44,0
not, as I have

66
00:52:44,0 --> 00:52:44,0
done unto

67
00:52:44,0 --> 00:52:44,0
Samaria and her

68
00:52:44,0 --> 00:52:44,0
idols, so do

69
00:52:44,0 --> 00:52:44,0
to Jerusalem

70
00:52:44,0 --> 00:52:16,
and to her idols?

71
00:52:16,0 --> 00:52:16,0
12 Wherefore

72
00:52:16,0 --> 00:52:16,0
it shall

73
00:52:16,0 --> 00:52:16,0
come to pass

74
00:52:16,0 --> 00:52:16,0
that when the

75
00:52:16,0 --> 00:52:16,0
Lord hath

76
00:52:16,0 --> 00:52:16,0
performed his

77
00:52:16,0 --> 00:52:16,0
whole work

78
00:52:16,0 --> 00:52:16,0
upon Mount

79
00:52:16,0 --> 00:52:16,0
Zion and upon

80
00:52:16,0 --> 00:52:16,0
Jerusalem,

81
00:52:16,0 --> 00:52:16,0
I will

82
00:52:16,0 --> 00:52:16,0
punish the fruit

83
00:52:16,0 --> 00:52:16,0
of the stout

84
00:52:16,0 --> 00:52:16,0
heart of

85
00:52:16,0 --> 00:52:16,0
the king of

86
00:52:16,0 --> 00:52:16,0
Assyria, and

87
00:52:16,0 --> 01:00:13,
the glory of his high looks.

88
01:00:13,0 --> 01:00:13,0
13 For he

89
01:00:13,0 --> 01:00:13,0
saith: By

90
01:00:13,0 --> 01:00:13,0
the strength

91
01:00:13,0 --> 01:00:13,0
of my hand

92
01:00:13,0 --> 01:00:13,0
and by my

93
01:00:13,0 --> 01:00:13,0
wisdom I

94
01:00:13,0 --> 01:00:13,0
have done

95
01:00:13,0 --> 01:00:13,0
these things;

96
01:00:13,0 --> 01:00:13,0
for I am

97
01:00:13,0 --> 01:00:13,0
prudent; and I

98
01:00:13,0 --> 01:00:13,0
have moved

99
01:00:13,0 --> 01:00:13,0
the

100
01:00:13,0 --> 01:00:13,0
borders of the

101
01:00:13,0 --> 01:00:13,0
people, and

102
01:00:13,0 --> 01:00:13,0
have robbed

103
01:00:13,0 --> 01:00:13,0
their

104
01:00:13,0 --> 01:00:13,0
treasures, and I

105
01:00:13,0 --> 01:00:13,0
have put

106
01:00:13,0 --> 01:00:13,0
down the

107
01:00:13,0 --> 00:59:59,
inhabitants like a valiant man;

108
00:59:59,0 --> 00:59:59,0
14 And my

109
00:59:59,0 --> 00:59:59,0
hand hath

110
00:59:59,0 --> 00:59:59,0
found as a

111
00:59:59,0 --> 00:59:59,0
nest the

112
00:59:59,0 --> 00:59:59,0
riches of

113
00:59:59,0 --> 00:59:59,0
the

114
00:59:59,0 --> 00:59:59,0
people; and as

115
00:59:59,0 --> 00:59:59,0
one

116
00:59:59,0 --> 00:59:59,0
gathereth eggs

117
00:59:59,0 --> 00:59:59,0
that are

118
00:59:59,0 --> 00:59:59,0
left have I

119
00:59:59,0 --> 00:59:59,0
gathered

120
00:59:59,0 --> 00:59:59,0
all the

121
00:59:59,0 --> 00:59:59,0
earth; and

122
00:59:59,0 --> 00:59:59,0
there was

123
00:59:59,0 --> 00:59:59,0
none that

124
00:59:59,0 --> 00:59:59,0
moved the

125
00:59:59,0 --> 00:59:59,0
wing, or

126
00:59:59,0 --> 01:04:56,
opened the mouth, or peeped.

127
01:04:56,0 --> 01:04:56,0
15 Shall

128
01:04:56,0 --> 01:04:56,0
the ax

129
01:04:56,0 --> 01:04:56,0
boast

130
01:04:56,0 --> 01:04:56,0
itself against

131
01:04:56,0 --> 01:04:56,0
him that

132
01:04:56,0 --> 01:04:56,0
heweth

133
01:04:56,0 --> 01:04:56,0
therewith?

134
01:04:56,0 --> 01:04:56,0
Shall

135
01:04:56,0 --> 01:04:56,0
the saw

136
01:04:56,0 --> 01:04:56,0
magnify

137
01:04:56,0 --> 01:04:56,0
itself

138
01:04:56,0 --> 01:04:56,0
against him

139
01:04:56,0 --> 01:04:56,0
that shaketh

140
01:04:56,0 --> 01:04:56,0
it? As

141
01:04:56,0 --> 01:04:56,0
if the rod

142
01:04:56,0 --> 01:04:56,0
should

143
01:04:56,0 --> 01:04:56,0
shake

144
01:04:56,0 --> 01:04:56,0
itself

145
01:04:56,0 --> 01:04:56,0
against them

146
01:04:56,0 --> 01:04:56,0
that lift

147
01:04:56,0 --> 01:04:56,0
it up, or

148
01:04:56,0 --> 01:04:56,0
as if the

149
01:04:56,0 --> 01:04:56,0
staff

150
01:04:56,0 --> 01:04:56,0
should lift

151
01:04:56,0 --> 01:04:42,
up itself as if it were no wood!

152
01:04:42,0 --> 01:04:42,0
16

153
01:04:42,0 --> 01:04:42,0
Therefore

154
01:04:42,0 --> 01:04:42,0
shall the

155
01:04:42,0 --> 01:04:42,0
Lord, the

156
01:04:42,0 --> 01:04:42,0
Lord of

157
01:04:42,0 --> 01:04:42,0
Hosts,

158
01:04:42,0 --> 01:04:42,0
send

159
01:04:42,0 --> 01:04:42,0
among his

160
01:04:42,0 --> 01:04:42,0
fat ones,

161
01:04:42,0 --> 01:04:42,0


162
01:04:42,0 --> 01:04:42,0
leanness; and

163
01:04:42,0 --> 01:04:42,0
under his

164
01:04:42,0 --> 01:04:42,0
glory

165
01:04:42,0 --> 01:04:42,0
he shall

166
01:04:42,0 --> 01:04:42,0
kindle a

167
01:04:42,0 --> 01:04:42,0
burning

168
01:04:42,0 --> 01:04:42,0
like

169
01:04:42,0 --> 01:04:14,
the burning of a fire.

170
01:04:14,0 --> 01:04:14,0
17 And

171
01:04:14,0 --> 01:04:14,0
the

172
01:04:14,0 --> 01:04:14,0
light of

173
01:04:14,0 --> 01:04:14,0
Israel

174
01:04:14,0 --> 01:04:14,0
shall be

175
01:04:14,0 --> 01:04:14,0
for a

176
01:04:14,0 --> 01:04:14,0
fire,

177
01:04:14,0 --> 01:04:14,0
and his

178
01:04:14,0 --> 01:04:14,0
Holy

179
01:04:14,0 --> 01:04:14,0
One for a

180
01:04:14,0 --> 01:04:14,0
flame,

181
01:04:14,0 --> 01:04:14,0
and

182
01:04:14,0 --> 01:04:14,0
shall

183
01:04:14,0 --> 01:04:14,0
burn and

184
01:04:14,0 --> 01:04:14,0
shall

185
01:04:14,0 --> 01:04:14,0
devour

186
01:04:14,0 --> 01:04:14,0
his

187
01:04:14,0 --> 01:04:14,0
thorns and

188
01:04:14,0 --> 01:04:00,
his briers in one day;

189
01:04:00,0 --> 01:04:00,0
18 And

190
01:04:00,0 --> 01:04:00,0
shall

191
01:04:00,0 --> 01:04:00,0


192
01:04:00,0 --> 01:04:00,0
consume the

193
01:04:00,0 --> 01:04:00,0
glory

194
01:04:00,0 --> 01:04:00,0
of

195
01:04:00,0 --> 01:04:00,0
his

196
01:04:00,0 --> 01:04:00,0
forest,

197
01:04:00,0 --> 01:04:00,0
and of

198
01:04:00,0 --> 01:04:00,0
his

199
01:04:00,0 --> 01:04:00,0
fruitful

200
01:04:00,0 --> 01:04:00,0
field,

201
01:04:00,0 --> 01:04:00,0
both

202
01:04:00,0 --> 01:04:00,0
soul

203
01:04:00,0 --> 01:04:00,0
and

204
01:04:00,0 --> 01:04:00,0
body; and

205
01:04:00,0 --> 01:04:00,0
they

206
01:04:00,0 --> 01:04:00,0
shall

207
01:04:00,0 --> 01:04:00,0
be as

208
01:04:00,0 --> 01:04:00,0
when a

209
01:04:00,0 --> 01:03:32,
standard-bearer fainteth.

210
01:03:32,0 --> 01:03:32,0
19

211
01:03:32,0 --> 01:03:32,0
And the

212
01:03:32,0 --> 01:03:32,0
rest

213
01:03:32,0 --> 01:03:32,0
of

214
01:03:32,0 --> 01:03:32,0
the

215
01:03:32,0 --> 01:03:32,0
trees

216
01:03:32,0 --> 01:03:32,0
of his

217
01:03:32,0 --> 01:03:32,0


218
01:03:32,0 --> 01:03:32,0
forest

219
01:03:32,0 --> 01:03:32,0
shall

220
01:03:32,0 --> 01:03:32,0
be

221
01:03:32,0 --> 01:03:32,0
few,

222
01:03:32,0 --> 01:03:32,0
that a

223
01:03:32,0 --> 01:03:32,0
child

224
01:03:32,0 --> 01:04:02,
may write them.

225
01:04:02,0 --> 01:04:02,0
20

226
01:04:02,0 --> 01:04:02,0
And

227
01:04:02,0 --> 01:04:02,0
it

228
01:04:02,0 --> 01:04:02,0
shall

229
01:04:02,0 --> 01:04:02,0
