00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:07,0
Chapter 20 The destruction of Assyria is a type

2
00:00:07,0 --> 00:00:14,0
of the destruction of the wicked at the Second

3
00:00:14,0 --> 00:00:21,0
Coming—Few people will be left after the Lord

4
00:00:21,0 --> 00:00:28,0
comes again—The remnant of Jacob will return in

5
00:00:28,0 --> 00:00:35,836
that day—Compare 
Isaiah 10. About 559–545 B.C. 

6
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:40,503
1 Wo unto them that decree

7
00:00:40,503 --> 00:00:45,17
unrighteous decrees, and that write

8
00:00:45,17 --> 00:00:49,182
grievousness which they have prescribed;

9
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:50,382
2 To turn away the needy from

10
00:00:50,382 --> 00:00:51,582
judgment, and to take away the

11
00:00:51,582 --> 00:00:52,782
right from the poor of my people,

12
00:00:52,782 --> 00:00:53,982
that widows may be their prey,

13
00:00:53,982 --> 00:00:55,055
and that they may rob the fatherless!

14
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,722
3 And what will ye do in

15
00:00:56,722 --> 00:00:58,389
the day of visitation, and in

16
00:00:58,389 --> 00:01:00,056
the desolation which shall

17
00:01:00,056 --> 00:01:01,723
come from far? to whom

18
00:01:01,723 --> 00:01:03,39
will ye flee for help? and

19
00:01:03,39 --> 00:01:05,399
where will ye leave your glory?

20
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:05,828
4 Without me they shall

21
00:01:05,828 --> 00:01:06,257
bow down under the

22
00:01:06,257 --> 00:01:06,686
prisoners, and they shall

23
00:01:06,686 --> 00:01:07,115
fall under the slain. For

24
00:01:07,115 --> 00:01:07,544
all this his anger is not

25
00:01:07,544 --> 00:01:07,973
turned away, but his

26
00:01:07,973 --> 00:01:08,869
hand is stretched out still.

27
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:09,369
5 O Assyrian, the rod

28
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:09,869
of mine anger, and

29
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:10,369
the staff in their

30
00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:10,337
hand is their indignation.

31
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:11,337
6 I will send him

32
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:12,337
against a hypocritical

33
00:01:12,337 --> 00:01:13,337
nation, and against

34
00:01:13,337 --> 00:01:14,337
the people of my

35
00:01:14,337 --> 00:01:15,337
wrath will I give him

36
00:01:15,337 --> 00:01:16,337
a charge to take the

37
00:01:16,337 --> 00:01:17,337
spoil, and to take

38
00:01:17,337 --> 00:01:18,337
the prey, and to

39
00:01:18,337 --> 00:01:19,337
tread them down like

40
00:01:19,337 --> 00:01:20,681
the mire of the streets.

41
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:20,681
7 Howbeit he

42
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:20,681
meaneth not so, neither

43
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:20,681
doth his heart

44
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:20,681
think so; but in his

45
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:20,681
heart it is to

46
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:20,681
destroy and cut off

47
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:20,213
nations not a few.

48
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:27,546
8 For he saith:

49
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:34,879
Are not my princes

50
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:42,002
altogether kings?

51
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:43,402
9 Is not Calno

52
00:01:43,402 --> 00:01:44,802
as Carchemish? Is

53
00:01:44,802 --> 00:01:46,202
not Hamath as

54
00:01:46,202 --> 00:01:47,602
Arpad? Is not

55
00:01:47,602 --> 00:01:49,509
Samaria as Damascus?

56
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:51,759
10 As my hand

57
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,009
hath founded the

58
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:56,259
kingdoms of

59
00:01:56,259 --> 00:01:58,509
the idols, and

60
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:00,759
whose graven

61
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:03,009
images did excel

62
00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:05,259
them of Jerusalem

63
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:07,361
and of Samaria;

64
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:08,218
11 Shall I

65
00:02:08,218 --> 00:02:09,075
not, as I have

66
00:02:09,075 --> 00:02:09,932
done unto

67
00:02:09,932 --> 00:02:10,789
Samaria and her

68
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:11,646
idols, so do

69
00:02:11,646 --> 00:02:12,503
to Jerusalem

70
00:02:12,503 --> 00:02:13,7
and to her idols?

71
00:02:13,7 --> 00:02:13,641
12 Wherefore

72
00:02:13,641 --> 00:02:13,582
it shall

73
00:02:13,582 --> 00:02:13,523
come to pass

74
00:02:13,523 --> 00:02:13,464
that when the

75
00:02:13,464 --> 00:02:13,405
Lord hath

76
00:02:13,405 --> 00:02:13,346
performed his

77
00:02:13,346 --> 00:02:13,287
whole work

78
00:02:13,287 --> 00:02:13,228
upon Mount

79
00:02:13,228 --> 00:02:13,169
Zion and upon

80
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:13,11
Jerusalem,

81
00:02:13,11 --> 00:02:13,051
I will

82
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:12,992
punish the fruit

83
00:02:12,992 --> 00:02:12,933
of the stout

84
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:12,874
heart of

85
00:02:12,874 --> 00:02:12,815
the king of

86
00:02:12,815 --> 00:02:12,756
Assyria, and

87
00:02:12,756 --> 00:02:12,766
the glory of his high looks.

88
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:13,566
13 For he

89
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:14,366
saith: By

90
00:02:14,366 --> 00:02:15,166
the strength

91
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:15,966
of my hand

92
00:02:15,966 --> 00:02:16,766
and by my

93
00:02:16,766 --> 00:02:17,566
wisdom I

94
00:02:17,566 --> 00:02:18,366
have done

95
00:02:18,366 --> 00:02:19,166
these things;

96
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:19,966
for I am

97
00:02:19,966 --> 00:02:20,766
prudent; and I

98
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:21,566
have moved

99
00:02:21,566 --> 00:02:22,366
the

100
00:02:22,366 --> 00:02:23,166
borders of the

101
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:23,966
people, and

102
00:02:23,966 --> 00:02:24,766
have robbed

103
00:02:24,766 --> 00:02:25,566
their

104
00:02:25,566 --> 00:02:26,366
treasures, and I

105
00:02:26,366 --> 00:02:27,166
have put

106
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:27,966
down the

107
00:02:27,966 --> 00:02:28,715
inhabitants like a valiant man;

108
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:29,241
14 And my

109
00:02:29,241 --> 00:02:29,767
hand hath

110
00:02:29,767 --> 00:02:30,293
found as a

111
00:02:30,293 --> 00:02:30,819
nest the

112
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:31,345
riches of

113
00:02:31,345 --> 00:02:31,871
the

114
00:02:31,871 --> 00:02:32,397
people; and as

115
00:02:32,397 --> 00:02:32,923
one

116
00:02:32,923 --> 00:02:33,449
gathereth eggs

117
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:33,975
that are

118
00:02:33,975 --> 00:02:34,501
left have I

119
00:02:34,501 --> 00:02:35,027
gathered

120
00:02:35,027 --> 00:02:35,553
all the

121
00:02:35,553 --> 00:02:36,079
earth; and

122
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:36,605
there was

123
00:02:36,605 --> 00:02:37,131
none that

124
00:02:37,131 --> 00:02:37,657
moved the

125
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:38,183
wing, or

126
00:02:38,183 --> 00:02:38,625
opened the mouth, or peeped.

127
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:38,585
15 Shall

128
00:02:38,585 --> 00:02:38,545
the ax

129
00:02:38,545 --> 00:02:38,505
boast

130
00:02:38,505 --> 00:02:38,465
itself against

131
00:02:38,465 --> 00:02:38,425
him that

132
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:38,385
heweth

133
00:02:38,385 --> 00:02:38,345
therewith?

134
00:02:38,345 --> 00:02:38,305
Shall

135
00:02:38,305 --> 00:02:38,265
the saw

136
00:02:38,265 --> 00:02:38,225
magnify

137
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:38,185
itself

138
00:02:38,185 --> 00:02:38,145
against him

139
00:02:38,145 --> 00:02:38,105
that shaketh

140
00:02:38,105 --> 00:02:38,065
it? As

141
00:02:38,065 --> 00:02:38,025
if the rod

142
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:37,985
should

143
00:02:37,985 --> 00:02:37,945
shake

144
00:02:37,945 --> 00:02:37,905
itself

145
00:02:37,905 --> 00:02:37,865
against them

146
00:02:37,865 --> 00:02:37,825
that lift

147
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:37,785
it up, or

148
00:02:37,785 --> 00:02:37,745
as if the

149
00:02:37,745 --> 00:02:37,705
staff

150
00:02:37,705 --> 00:02:37,665
should lift

151
00:02:37,665 --> 00:02:37,691
up itself as if it were no wood!

152
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:37,635
16

153
00:02:37,635 --> 00:02:37,579
Therefore

154
00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:37,523
shall the

155
00:02:37,523 --> 00:02:37,467
Lord, the

156
00:02:37,467 --> 00:02:37,411
Lord of

157
00:02:37,411 --> 00:02:37,355
Hosts,

158
00:02:37,355 --> 00:02:37,299
send

159
00:02:37,299 --> 00:02:37,243
among his

160
00:02:37,243 --> 00:02:37,187
fat ones,

161
00:02:37,187 --> 00:02:37,131


162
00:02:37,131 --> 00:02:37,075
leanness; and

163
00:02:37,075 --> 00:02:37,019
under his

164
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:36,963
glory

165
00:02:36,963 --> 00:02:36,907
he shall

166
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:36,851
kindle a

167
00:02:36,851 --> 00:02:36,795
burning

168
00:02:36,795 --> 00:02:36,739
like

169
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:36,757
the burning of a fire.

170
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:36,968
17 And

171
00:02:36,968 --> 00:02:37,179
the

172
00:02:37,179 --> 00:02:37,39
light of

173
00:02:37,39 --> 00:02:37,601
Israel

174
00:02:37,601 --> 00:02:37,812
shall be

175
00:02:37,812 --> 00:02:38,023
for a

176
00:02:38,023 --> 00:02:38,234
fire,

177
00:02:38,234 --> 00:02:38,445
and his

178
00:02:38,445 --> 00:02:38,656
Holy

179
00:02:38,656 --> 00:02:38,867
One for a

180
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:39,078
flame,

181
00:02:39,078 --> 00:02:39,289
and

182
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:39,5
shall

183
00:02:39,5 --> 00:02:39,711
burn and

184
00:02:39,711 --> 00:02:39,922
shall

185
00:02:39,922 --> 00:02:40,133
devour

186
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:40,344
his

187
00:02:40,344 --> 00:02:40,555
thorns and

188
00:02:40,555 --> 00:02:40,227
his briers in one day;

189
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:40,179
18 And

190
00:02:40,179 --> 00:02:40,131
shall

191
00:02:40,131 --> 00:02:40,083


192
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:40,035
consume the

193
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:39,987
glory

194
00:02:39,987 --> 00:02:39,939
of

195
00:02:39,939 --> 00:02:39,891
his

196
00:02:39,891 --> 00:02:39,843
forest,

197
00:02:39,843 --> 00:02:39,795
and of

198
00:02:39,795 --> 00:02:39,747
his

199
00:02:39,747 --> 00:02:39,699
fruitful

200
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:39,651
field,

201
00:02:39,651 --> 00:02:39,603
both

202
00:02:39,603 --> 00:02:39,555
soul

203
00:02:39,555 --> 00:02:39,507
and

204
00:02:39,507 --> 00:02:39,459
body; and

205
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:39,411
they
