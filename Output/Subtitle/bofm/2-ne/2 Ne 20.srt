1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,4
Chapter 20 The destruction of Assyria is a type of

2
00:00:01,4 --> 00:00:02,8
 the destruction of the wicked at the Second

3
00:00:02,8 --> 00:00:04,2
 Coming—Few people will be left after the Lord comes

4
00:00:04,2 --> 00:00:05,6
 again—The remnant of Jacob will return in that

5
00:00:05,6 --> 00:00:07,0
 day—Compare 
Isaiah 10. About 559–545 B.C.

6
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:10,642
1 Wo unto them that decree unrighteous decrees,

7
00:00:10,642 --> 00:00:13,309
 and that write grievousness which they have

8
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:15,976
 prescribed

9
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,949
2 To turn away the needy from judgment, and to

10
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:19,949
 take away the right from the poor of my people, that

11
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:21,949
 widows may be their prey, and that they may rob

12
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:23,949
 the fatherless

13
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,924
3 And what will ye do in the day of visitation,

14
00:00:25,924 --> 00:00:27,924
 and in the desolation which shall come from far? to

15
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:29,924
 whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye

16
00:00:29,924 --> 00:00:31,924
 leave your glory

17
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,899
4 Without me they shall bow down under the

18
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,899
 prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain. For all

19
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:37,899
 this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is

20
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:39,899
 stretched out still

21
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:43,873
5 O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff

22
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:47,873
 in their hand is their indignation

23
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,448
6 I will send him against a hypocritical nation,

24
00:00:49,448 --> 00:00:51,048
 and against the people of my wrath will I give him

25
00:00:51,048 --> 00:00:52,648
 a charge to take the spoil, and to take the prey,

26
00:00:52,648 --> 00:00:54,248
 and to tread them down like the mire of the

27
00:00:54,248 --> 00:00:55,848
 streets

28
00:00:55,822 --> 00:01:01,155
7 Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his

29
00:01:01,155 --> 00:01:06,488
 heart think so; but in his heart it is to destroy and

30
00:01:06,488 --> 00:01:11,821
 cut off nations not a few

31
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:23,772
8 For he saith: Are not my princes altogether

32
00:01:23,772 --> 00:01:35,772
 kings

33
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:43,696
9 Is not Calno as Carchemish? Is not Hamath as

34
00:01:43,696 --> 00:01:51,696
 Arpad? Is not Samaria as Damascus

35
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:54,312
10 As my hand hath founded the kingdoms of the

36
00:01:54,312 --> 00:01:56,979
 idols, and whose graven images did excel them of

37
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:59,646
 Jerusalem and of Samaria

38
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:03,62
11 Shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and

39
00:02:03,62 --> 00:02:07,62
 her idols, so do to Jerusalem and to her idols

40
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:10,794
12 Wherefore it shall come to pass that when the

41
00:02:10,794 --> 00:02:13,994
 Lord hath performed his whole work upon Mount Zion

42
00:02:13,994 --> 00:02:17,194
 and upon Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the

43
00:02:17,194 --> 00:02:20,394
 stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory

44
00:02:20,394 --> 00:02:23,594
 of his high looks

45
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:29,943
13 For he saith: By the strength of my hand and by

46
00:02:29,943 --> 00:02:36,343
 my wisdom I have done these things; for I am

47
00:02:36,343 --> 00:02:42,743
 prudent; and I have moved the borders of the people,

48
00:02:42,743 --> 00:02:49,143
 and have robbed their treasures, and I have put

49
00:02:49,143 --> 00:02:55,543
 down the inhabitants like a valiant man

50
00:02:55,442 --> 00:03:08,242
14 And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of

51
00:03:08,242 --> 00:03:21,042
 the people; and as one gathereth eggs that are

52
00:03:21,042 --> 00:03:33,842
 left have I gathered all the earth; and there was

53
00:03:33,842 --> 00:03:46,642
 none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or

54
00:03:46,642 --> 00:03:59,442
 peeped

55
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,439
15 Shall the ax boast itself against him that

56
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:05,639
 heweth therewith? Shall the saw magnify itself against

57
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:08,839
 him that shaketh it? As if the rod should shake

58
00:04:08,839 --> 00:04:12,039
 itself against them that lift it up, or as if the

59
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:15,239
 staff should lift up itself as if it were no wood

60
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:19,188
16 Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of Hosts,

61
00:04:19,188 --> 00:04:23,188
 send among his fat ones, leanness; and under his

62
00:04:23,188 --> 00:04:27,188
 glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a

63
00:04:27,188 --> 00:04:31,188
 fire

64
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:39,138
17 And the light of Israel shall be for a fire,

65
00:04:39,138 --> 00:04:47,138
 and his Holy One for a flame, and shall burn and

66
00:04:47,138 --> 00:04:55,138
 shall devour his thorns and his briers in one day

67
00:04:55,061 --> 00:05:00,394
18 And shall consume the glory of his forest, and

68
00:05:00,394 --> 00:05:05,727
 of his fruitful field, both soul and body; and

69
00:05:05,727 --> 00:05:11,06
 they shall be as when a standard-bearer fainteth

70
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:18,511
19 And the rest of the trees of his forest shall

71
00:05:18,511 --> 00:05:26,011
 be few, that a child may write them

72
00:05:26,96 --> 00:05:30,16
20 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the

73
00:05:30,16 --> 00:05:33,36
 remnant of Israel, and such as are escaped of the

74
00:05:33,36 --> 00:05:36,56
 house of Jacob, shall no more again stay upon him

75
00:05:36,56 --> 00:05:39,76
 that smote them, but shall stay upon the Lord,

76
00:05:39,76 --> 00:05:42,96
 the Holy One of Israel, in truth

77
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:58,909
21 The remnant shall return, yea, even the remnant

78
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:14,909
 of Jacob, unto the mighty God

79
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:16,808
22 For though thy people Israel be as the sand of

80
00:06:16,808 --> 00:06:18,808
 the sea, yet a remnant of them shall return; the

81
00:06:18,808 --> 00:06:20,808
 consumption decreed shall overflow with

82
00:06:20,808 --> 00:06:22,808
 righteousness

83
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:34,782
23 For the Lord God of Hosts shall make a

84
00:06:34,782 --> 00:06:46,782
 consumption, even determined in all the land

85
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,306
24 Therefore, thus saith the Lord God of Hosts: O

86
00:06:48,306 --> 00:06:49,906
 my people that dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of

87
00:06:49,906 --> 00:06:51,506
 the Assyrian; he shall smite thee with a rod, and

88
00:06:51,506 --> 00:06:53,106
 shall lift up his staff against thee, after the

89
00:06:53,106 --> 00:06:54,706
 manner of Egypt

90
00:06:54,681 --> 00:07:13,348
25 For yet a very little while, and the

91
00:07:13,348 --> 00:07:32,015
 indignation shall cease, and mine anger in their

92
00:07:32,015 --> 00:07:50,682
 destruction

93
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:54,503
26 And the Lord of Hosts shall stir up a scourge

94
00:07:54,503 --> 00:07:58,503
 for him according to the slaughter of Midian at the

95
00:07:58,503 --> 00:08:02,503
 rock of Oreb; and as his rod was upon the sea so

96
00:08:02,503 --> 00:08:06,503
 shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt

97
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:10,453
27 And it shall come to pass in that day that his

98
00:08:10,453 --> 00:08:14,453
 burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder,

99
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:18,453
 and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall

100
00:08:18,453 --> 00:08:22,453
 be destroyed because of the anointing

101
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:26,402
28 He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at

102
00:08:26,402 --> 00:08:30,402
 Michmash he hath laid up his carriages

103
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:33,044
29 They are gone over the passage; they have taken

104
00:08:33,044 --> 00:08:35,711
 up their lodging at Geba; Ramath is afraid;

105
00:08:35,711 --> 00:08:38,378
 Gibeah of Saul is fled

106
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:58,351
30 Lift up the voice, O daughter of Gallim; cause

107
00:08:58,351 --> 00:09:18,351
 it to be heard unto Laish, O poor Anathoth

108
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:22,224
31 Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim

109
00:09:22,224 --> 00:09:26,224
 gather themselves to flee

110
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:44,866
32 As yet shall he remain at Nob that day; he

111
00:09:44,866 --> 00:10:03,533
 shall shake his hand against the mount of the daughter

112
00:10:03,533 --> 00:10:22,2
 of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem

113
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:27,771
33 Behold, the Lord, the Lord of Hosts shall lop

114
00:10:27,771 --> 00:10:33,521
 the bough with terror; and the high ones of stature

115
00:10:33,521 --> 00:10:39,271
 shall be hewn down; and the haughty shall be

116
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:45,021
 humbled

117
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:46,278
34 And he shall cut down the thickets of the

118
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:46,611
 forests with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty

119
00:10:46,611 --> 00:10:46,944
 one.
