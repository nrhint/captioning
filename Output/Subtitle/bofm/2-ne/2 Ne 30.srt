1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:03,2
Chapter 30 Converted Gentiles will be

2
00:00:03,2 --> 00:00:06,4
numbered with the covenant people—Many

3
00:00:06,4 --> 00:00:09,6
Lamanites and Jews will believe the word and

4
00:00:09,6 --> 00:00:12,8
become delightsome—Israel will be restored and

5
00:00:12,8 --> 00:00:16,917
the wicked destroyed. About 559–545 B.C. 

6
00:00:16,917 --> 00:00:18,028
1 And now behold, my beloved brethren, I

7
00:00:18,028 --> 00:00:19,139
would speak unto you; for I, Nephi,

8
00:00:19,139 --> 00:00:20,25
would not suffer that ye should suppose

9
00:00:20,25 --> 00:00:21,361
that ye are more righteous than the

10
00:00:21,361 --> 00:00:22,472
Gentiles shall be. For behold, except ye shall

11
00:00:22,472 --> 00:00:23,583
keep the commandments of God ye shall

12
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:24,694
all likewise perish; and because of the

13
00:00:24,694 --> 00:00:25,805
words which have been spoken ye need not

14
00:00:25,805 --> 00:00:26,827
suppose that the Gentiles are utterly destroyed.

15
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:27,202
2 For behold, I say unto you that as

16
00:00:27,202 --> 00:00:27,577
many of the Gentiles as will repent

17
00:00:27,577 --> 00:00:27,952
are the covenant people of the

18
00:00:27,952 --> 00:00:28,327
Lord; and as many of the Jews as will

19
00:00:28,327 --> 00:00:28,702
not repent shall be cast off; for the

20
00:00:28,702 --> 00:00:29,077
Lord covenanteth with none save it

21
00:00:29,077 --> 00:00:29,452
be with them that repent and believe

22
00:00:29,452 --> 00:00:29,83
in his Son, who is the Holy One of Israel.

23
00:00:29,83 --> 00:00:31,53
3 And now, I would prophesy

24
00:00:31,53 --> 00:00:33,23
somewhat more concerning the Jews and

25
00:00:33,23 --> 00:00:34,93
the Gentiles. For after the book

26
00:00:34,93 --> 00:00:36,63
of which I have spoken shall come

27
00:00:36,63 --> 00:00:38,33
forth, and be written unto the

28
00:00:38,33 --> 00:00:40,03
Gentiles, and sealed up again unto

29
00:00:40,03 --> 00:00:41,73
the Lord, there shall be many

30
00:00:41,73 --> 00:00:43,43
which shall believe the words which

31
00:00:43,43 --> 00:00:45,13
are written; and they shall

32
00:00:45,13 --> 00:00:46,747
carry them forth unto the remnant of our seed.

33
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:46,547
4 And then shall the remnant

34
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:46,347
of our seed know concerning

35
00:00:46,347 --> 00:00:46,147
us, how that we came out

36
00:00:46,147 --> 00:00:45,947
from Jerusalem, and that they

37
00:00:45,947 --> 00:00:45,812
are descendants of the Jews.

38
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:45,687
5 And the gospel of Jesus

39
00:00:45,687 --> 00:00:45,562
Christ shall be declared

40
00:00:45,562 --> 00:00:45,437
among them; wherefore, they

41
00:00:45,437 --> 00:00:45,312
shall be restored unto

42
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:45,187
the knowledge of their

43
00:00:45,187 --> 00:00:45,062
fathers, and also to the

44
00:00:45,062 --> 00:00:44,937
knowledge of Jesus Christ, which

45
00:00:44,937 --> 00:00:44,878
was had among their fathers.

46
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:45,242
6 And then shall they

47
00:00:45,242 --> 00:00:45,606
rejoice; for they shall know

48
00:00:45,606 --> 00:00:45,97
that it is a blessing

49
00:00:45,97 --> 00:00:46,334
unto them from the hand of

50
00:00:46,334 --> 00:00:46,698
God; and their scales of

51
00:00:46,698 --> 00:00:47,062
darkness shall begin to

52
00:00:47,062 --> 00:00:47,426
fall from their eyes; and

53
00:00:47,426 --> 00:00:47,79
many generations shall

54
00:00:47,79 --> 00:00:48,154
not pass away among them,

55
00:00:48,154 --> 00:00:48,518
save they shall be a pure

56
00:00:48,518 --> 00:00:48,348
and a delightsome people.

57
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:48,248
7 And it shall come to

58
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:48,148
pass that the Jews which

59
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:48,048
are scattered also shall

60
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:47,948
begin to believe in

61
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:47,848
Christ; and they shall

62
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:47,748
begin to gather in upon the

63
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:47,648
face of the land; and as

64
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:47,548
many as shall believe

65
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:47,448
in Christ shall also

66
00:00:47,448 --> 00:00:47,414
become a delightsome people.

67
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:47,289
8 And it shall come to

68
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:47,164
pass that the Lord

69
00:00:47,164 --> 00:00:47,039
God shall commence his

70
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:46,914
work among all nations,

71
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:46,789
kindreds, tongues,

72
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:46,664
and people, to bring

73
00:00:46,664 --> 00:00:46,539
about the restoration of

74
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:46,48
his people upon the earth.

75
00:00:46,48 --> 00:00:46,48
9 And with

76
00:00:46,48 --> 00:00:46,48
righteousness shall the Lord

77
00:00:46,48 --> 00:00:46,48
God judge the poor,

78
00:00:46,48 --> 00:00:46,48
and reprove with

79
00:00:46,48 --> 00:00:46,48
equity for the meek of

80
00:00:46,48 --> 00:00:46,48
the earth. And he

81
00:00:46,48 --> 00:00:46,48
shall smite the earth

82
00:00:46,48 --> 00:00:46,48
with the rod of his

83
00:00:46,48 --> 00:00:46,48
mouth; and with the

84
00:00:46,48 --> 00:00:46,48
breath of his lips

85
00:00:46,48 --> 00:00:46,013
shall he slay the wicked.

86
00:00:46,013 --> 00:00:45,93
10 For the time

87
00:00:45,93 --> 00:00:45,847
speedily cometh that

88
00:00:45,847 --> 00:00:45,764
the Lord God

89
00:00:45,764 --> 00:00:45,681
shall cause a great

90
00:00:45,681 --> 00:00:45,598
division among the

91
00:00:45,598 --> 00:00:45,515
people, and the

92
00:00:45,515 --> 00:00:45,432
wicked will he

93
00:00:45,432 --> 00:00:45,349
destroy; and he will

94
00:00:45,349 --> 00:00:45,266
spare his people,

95
00:00:45,266 --> 00:00:45,183
yea, even if it so be

96
00:00:45,183 --> 00:00:45,1
that he must

97
00:00:45,1 --> 00:00:45,078
destroy the wicked by fire.

98
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:45,578
11 And

99
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:46,078
righteousness shall be

100
00:00:46,078 --> 00:00:46,578
the girdle of his

101
00:00:46,578 --> 00:00:47,078
loins, and

102
00:00:47,078 --> 00:00:47,578
faithfulness the

103
00:00:47,578 --> 00:00:48,081
girdle of his reins.

104
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:47,998
12 And then

105
00:00:47,998 --> 00:00:47,915
shall the wolf

106
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:47,832
dwell with the

107
00:00:47,832 --> 00:00:47,749
lamb; and the

108
00:00:47,749 --> 00:00:47,666
leopard shall lie

109
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:47,583
down with the

110
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:47,5
kid, and the

111
00:00:47,5 --> 00:00:47,417
calf, and the young

112
00:00:47,417 --> 00:00:47,334
lion, and the

113
00:00:47,334 --> 00:00:47,251
fatling,

114
00:00:47,251 --> 00:00:47,168
together; and a

115
00:00:47,168 --> 00:00:47,147
little child shall lead them.

116
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:47,036
13 And the

117
00:00:47,036 --> 00:00:46,925
cow and the

118
00:00:46,925 --> 00:00:46,814
bear shall feed;

119
00:00:46,814 --> 00:00:46,703
their young

120
00:00:46,703 --> 00:00:46,592
ones shall

121
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:46,481
lie down

122
00:00:46,481 --> 00:00:46,37
together; and the

123
00:00:46,37 --> 00:00:46,259
lion shall eat

124
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:46,213
straw like the ox.

125
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:46,313
14 And the

126
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:46,413
sucking child

127
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:46,513
shall play

128
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:46,613
on the hole

129
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:46,713
of the asp,

130
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:46,813
and the

131
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:46,913
weaned child

132
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:47,013
shall put his

133
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:47,113
hand on the

134
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:47,214
cockatrice’s den.

135
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:47,137
15 They

136
00:00:47,137 --> 00:00:47,06
shall not hurt

137
00:00:47,06 --> 00:00:46,983
nor

138
00:00:46,983 --> 00:00:46,906
destroy in all my

139
00:00:46,906 --> 00:00:46,829
holy

140
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:46,752
mountain; for

141
00:00:46,752 --> 00:00:46,675
the earth

142
00:00:46,675 --> 00:00:46,598
shall be full

143
00:00:46,598 --> 00:00:46,521
of the

144
00:00:46,521 --> 00:00:46,444
knowledge of

145
00:00:46,444 --> 00:00:46,367
the Lord as

146
00:00:46,367 --> 00:00:46,29
the waters

147
00:00:46,29 --> 00:00:46,28
cover the sea.

148
00:00:46,28 --> 00:00:46,197
16

149
00:00:46,197 --> 00:00:46,114
Wherefore, the

150
00:00:46,114 --> 00:00:46,031
things of

151
00:00:46,031 --> 00:00:45,948
all nations

152
00:00:45,948 --> 00:00:45,865
shall be

153
00:00:45,865 --> 00:00:45,782
made known;

154
00:00:45,782 --> 00:00:45,699
yea, all

155
00:00:45,699 --> 00:00:45,616
things

156
00:00:45,616 --> 00:00:45,533
shall be made

157
00:00:45,533 --> 00:00:45,45
known

158
00:00:45,45 --> 00:00:45,367
unto the

159
00:00:45,367 --> 00:00:45,812
children of men.

160
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:45,767
17 There

161
00:00:45,767 --> 00:00:45,722
is

162
00:00:45,722 --> 00:00:45,677
nothing which

163
00:00:45,677 --> 00:00:45,632
is secret

164
00:00:45,632 --> 00:00:45,587
save it

165
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:45,542
shall be

166
00:00:45,542 --> 00:00:45,497
revealed;

167
00:00:45,497 --> 00:00:45,452
there is

168
00:00:45,452 --> 00:00:45,407
no work

169
00:00:45,407 --> 00:00:45,362
of

170
00:00:45,362 --> 00:00:45,317
darkness save it

171
00:00:45,317 --> 00:00:45,272
shall be

172
00:00:45,272 --> 00:00:45,227
made

173
00:00:45,227 --> 00:00:45,182
manifest in

174
00:00:45,182 --> 00:00:45,137
the

175
00:00:45,137 --> 00:00:45,092
light; and

176
00:00:45,092 --> 00:00:45,047
there is

177
00:00:45,047 --> 00:00:45,002
nothing

178
00:00:45,002 --> 00:00:44,957
which is

179
00:00:44,957 --> 00:00:44,912
sealed upon

180
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:44,867
the earth

181
00:00:44,867 --> 00:00:44,878
save it shall be loosed.

182
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:45,016
18

183
00:00:45,016 --> 00:00:45,154
Wherefore,

184
00:00:45,154 --> 00:00:45,292
all things

185
00:00:45,292 --> 00:00:45,43
which

186
00:00:45,43 --> 00:00:45,568
have been

187
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:45,706


188
00:00:45,706 --> 00:00:45,844
revealed unto

189
00:00:45,844 --> 00:00:45,982
the

190
00:00:45,982 --> 00:00:46,12
children of

191
00:00:46,12 --> 00:00:46,258
men shall

192
00:00:46,258 --> 00:00:46,396
at that

193
00:00:46,396 --> 00:00:46,534
day be

194
00:00:46,534 --> 00:00:46,672


195
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:46,81
revealed; and

196
00:00:46,81 --> 00:00:46,948
Satan

197
00:00:46,948 --> 00:00:47,086
shall have

198
00:00:47,086 --> 00:00:47,224
power

199
00:00:47,224 --> 00:00:47,362
over the

200
00:00:47,362 --> 00:00:47,5
hearts of

201
00:00:47,5 --> 00:00:47,638
the

202
00:00:47,638 --> 00:00:47,776
children of

203
00:00:47,776 --> 00:00:47,914
men no

204
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:48,052
more, for

205
00:00:48,052 --> 00:00:48,19
a long

206
00:00:48,19 --> 00:00:48,328
time.

207
00:00:48,328 --> 00:00:48,466
And now,

208
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:48,604
my

209
00:00:48,604 --> 00:00:48,742
beloved

210
00:00:48,742 --> 00:00:48,348
brethren, I make an end of my sayings.
