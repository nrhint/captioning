00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 30 Converted Gentiles will be

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
numbered with the covenant people—Many

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Lamanites and Jews will believe the word and

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
become delightsome—Israel will be restored and

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:03:31,
the wicked destroyed. About 559–545 B.C. 

6
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
1 And now behold, my beloved brethren, I

7
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
would speak unto you; for I, Nephi,

8
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
would not suffer that ye should suppose

9
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
that ye are more righteous than the

10
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
Gentiles shall be. For behold, except ye shall

11
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
keep the commandments of God ye shall

12
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
all likewise perish; and because of the

13
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
words which have been spoken ye need not

14
00:03:31,0 --> 00:08:28,
suppose that the Gentiles are utterly destroyed.

15
00:08:28,0 --> 00:08:28,0
2 For behold, I say unto you that as

16
00:08:28,0 --> 00:08:28,0
many of the Gentiles as will repent

17
00:08:28,0 --> 00:08:28,0
are the covenant people of the

18
00:08:28,0 --> 00:08:28,0
Lord; and as many of the Jews as will

19
00:08:28,0 --> 00:08:28,0
not repent shall be cast off; for the

20
00:08:28,0 --> 00:08:28,0
Lord covenanteth with none save it

21
00:08:28,0 --> 00:08:28,0
be with them that repent and believe

22
00:08:28,0 --> 00:08:00,
in his Son, who is the Holy One of Israel.

23
00:08:00,0 --> 00:08:00,0
3 And now, I would prophesy

24
00:08:00,0 --> 00:08:00,0
somewhat more concerning the Jews and

25
00:08:00,0 --> 00:08:00,0
the Gentiles. For after the book

26
00:08:00,0 --> 00:08:00,0
of which I have spoken shall come

27
00:08:00,0 --> 00:08:00,0
forth, and be written unto the

28
00:08:00,0 --> 00:08:00,0
Gentiles, and sealed up again unto

29
00:08:00,0 --> 00:08:00,0
the Lord, there shall be many

30
00:08:00,0 --> 00:08:00,0
which shall believe the words which

31
00:08:00,0 --> 00:08:00,0
are written; and they shall

32
00:08:00,0 --> 00:07:32,
carry them forth unto the remnant of our seed.

33
00:07:32,0 --> 00:07:32,0
4 And then shall the remnant

34
00:07:32,0 --> 00:07:32,0
of our seed know concerning

35
00:07:32,0 --> 00:07:32,0
us, how that we came out

36
00:07:32,0 --> 00:07:32,0
from Jerusalem, and that they

37
00:07:32,0 --> 00:09:16,
are descendants of the Jews.

38
00:09:16,0 --> 00:09:16,0
5 And the gospel of Jesus

39
00:09:16,0 --> 00:09:16,0
Christ shall be declared

40
00:09:16,0 --> 00:09:16,0
among them; wherefore, they

41
00:09:16,0 --> 00:09:16,0
shall be restored unto

42
00:09:16,0 --> 00:09:16,0
the knowledge of their

43
00:09:16,0 --> 00:09:16,0
fathers, and also to the

44
00:09:16,0 --> 00:09:16,0
knowledge of Jesus Christ, which

45
00:09:16,0 --> 00:08:48,
was had among their fathers.

46
00:08:48,0 --> 00:08:48,0
6 And then shall they

47
00:08:48,0 --> 00:08:48,0
rejoice; for they shall know

48
00:08:48,0 --> 00:08:48,0
that it is a blessing

49
00:08:48,0 --> 00:08:48,0
unto them from the hand of

50
00:08:48,0 --> 00:08:48,0
God; and their scales of

51
00:08:48,0 --> 00:08:48,0
darkness shall begin to

52
00:08:48,0 --> 00:08:48,0
fall from their eyes; and

53
00:08:48,0 --> 00:08:48,0
many generations shall

54
00:08:48,0 --> 00:08:48,0
not pass away among them,

55
00:08:48,0 --> 00:08:48,0
save they shall be a pure

56
00:08:48,0 --> 00:16:45,
and a delightsome people.

57
00:16:45,0 --> 00:16:45,0
7 And it shall come to

58
00:16:45,0 --> 00:16:45,0
pass that the Jews which

59
00:16:45,0 --> 00:16:45,0
are scattered also shall

60
00:16:45,0 --> 00:16:45,0
begin to believe in

61
00:16:45,0 --> 00:16:45,0
Christ; and they shall

62
00:16:45,0 --> 00:16:45,0
begin to gather in upon the

63
00:16:45,0 --> 00:16:45,0
face of the land; and as

64
00:16:45,0 --> 00:16:45,0
many as shall believe

65
00:16:45,0 --> 00:16:45,0
in Christ shall also

66
00:16:45,0 --> 00:18:29,
become a delightsome people.

67
00:18:29,0 --> 00:18:29,0
8 And it shall come to

68
00:18:29,0 --> 00:18:29,0
pass that the Lord

69
00:18:29,0 --> 00:18:29,0
God shall commence his

70
00:18:29,0 --> 00:18:29,0
work among all nations,

71
00:18:29,0 --> 00:18:29,0
kindreds, tongues,

72
00:18:29,0 --> 00:18:29,0
and people, to bring

73
00:18:29,0 --> 00:18:29,0
about the restoration of

74
00:18:29,0 --> 00:24:11,
his people upon the earth.

75
00:24:11,0 --> 00:24:11,0
9 And with

76
00:24:11,0 --> 00:24:11,0
righteousness shall the Lord

77
00:24:11,0 --> 00:24:11,0
God judge the poor,

78
00:24:11,0 --> 00:24:11,0
and reprove with

79
00:24:11,0 --> 00:24:11,0
equity for the meek of

80
00:24:11,0 --> 00:24:11,0
the earth. And he

81
00:24:11,0 --> 00:24:11,0
shall smite the earth

82
00:24:11,0 --> 00:24:11,0
with the rod of his

83
00:24:11,0 --> 00:24:11,0
mouth; and with the

84
00:24:11,0 --> 00:24:11,0
breath of his lips

85
00:24:11,0 --> 00:23:43,
shall he slay the wicked.

86
00:23:43,0 --> 00:23:43,0
10 For the time

87
00:23:43,0 --> 00:23:43,0
speedily cometh that

88
00:23:43,0 --> 00:23:43,0
the Lord God

89
00:23:43,0 --> 00:23:43,0
shall cause a great

90
00:23:43,0 --> 00:23:43,0
division among the

91
00:23:43,0 --> 00:23:43,0
people, and the

92
00:23:43,0 --> 00:23:43,0
wicked will he

93
00:23:43,0 --> 00:23:43,0
destroy; and he will

94
00:23:43,0 --> 00:23:43,0
spare his people,

95
00:23:43,0 --> 00:23:43,0
yea, even if it so be

96
00:23:43,0 --> 00:23:43,0
that he must

97
00:23:43,0 --> 00:23:15,
destroy the wicked by fire.

98
00:23:15,0 --> 00:23:15,0
11 And

99
00:23:15,0 --> 00:23:15,0
righteousness shall be

100
00:23:15,0 --> 00:23:15,0
the girdle of his

101
00:23:15,0 --> 00:23:15,0
loins, and

102
00:23:15,0 --> 00:23:15,0
faithfulness the

103
00:23:15,0 --> 00:23:01,
girdle of his reins.

104
00:23:01,0 --> 00:23:01,0
12 And then

105
00:23:01,0 --> 00:23:01,0
shall the wolf

106
00:23:01,0 --> 00:23:01,0
dwell with the

107
00:23:01,0 --> 00:23:01,0
lamb; and the

108
00:23:01,0 --> 00:23:01,0
leopard shall lie

109
00:23:01,0 --> 00:23:01,0
down with the

110
00:23:01,0 --> 00:23:01,0
kid, and the

111
00:23:01,0 --> 00:23:01,0
calf, and the young

112
00:23:01,0 --> 00:23:01,0
lion, and the

113
00:23:01,0 --> 00:23:01,0
fatling,

114
00:23:01,0 --> 00:23:01,0
together; and a

115
00:23:01,0 --> 00:22:47,
little child shall lead them.

116
00:22:47,0 --> 00:22:47,0
13 And the

117
00:22:47,0 --> 00:22:47,0
cow and the

118
00:22:47,0 --> 00:22:47,0
bear shall feed;

119
00:22:47,0 --> 00:22:47,0
their young

120
00:22:47,0 --> 00:22:47,0
ones shall

121
00:22:47,0 --> 00:22:47,0
lie down

122
00:22:47,0 --> 00:22:47,0
together; and the

123
00:22:47,0 --> 00:22:47,0
lion shall eat

124
00:22:47,0 --> 00:22:33,
straw like the ox.

125
00:22:33,0 --> 00:22:33,0
14 And the

126
00:22:33,0 --> 00:22:33,0
sucking child

127
00:22:33,0 --> 00:22:33,0
shall play

128
00:22:33,0 --> 00:22:33,0
on the hole

129
00:22:33,0 --> 00:22:33,0
of the asp,

130
00:22:33,0 --> 00:22:33,0
and the

131
00:22:33,0 --> 00:22:33,0
weaned child

132
00:22:33,0 --> 00:22:33,0
shall put his

133
00:22:33,0 --> 00:22:33,0
hand on the

134
00:22:33,0 --> 00:22:05,
cockatrice’s den.

135
00:22:05,0 --> 00:22:05,0
15 They

136
00:22:05,0 --> 00:22:05,0
shall not hurt

137
00:22:05,0 --> 00:22:05,0
nor

138
00:22:05,0 --> 00:22:05,0
destroy in all my

139
00:22:05,0 --> 00:22:05,0
holy

140
00:22:05,0 --> 00:22:05,0
mountain; for

141
00:22:05,0 --> 00:22:05,0
the earth

142
00:22:05,0 --> 00:22:05,0
shall be full

143
00:22:05,0 --> 00:22:05,0
of the

144
00:22:05,0 --> 00:22:05,0
knowledge of

145
00:22:05,0 --> 00:22:05,0
the Lord as

146
00:22:05,0 --> 00:22:05,0
the waters

147
00:22:05,0 --> 00:21:51,
cover the sea.

148
00:21:51,0 --> 00:21:51,0
16

149
00:21:51,0 --> 00:21:51,0
Wherefore, the

150
00:21:51,0 --> 00:21:51,0
things of

151
00:21:51,0 --> 00:21:51,0
all nations

152
00:21:51,0 --> 00:21:51,0
shall be

153
00:21:51,0 --> 00:21:51,0
made known;

154
00:21:51,0 --> 00:21:51,0
yea, all

155
00:21:51,0 --> 00:21:51,0
things

156
00:21:51,0 --> 00:21:51,0
shall be made

157
00:21:51,0 --> 00:21:51,0
known

158
00:21:51,0 --> 00:21:51,0
unto the

159
00:21:51,0 --> 00:21:23,
children of men.

160
00:21:23,0 --> 00:21:23,0
17 There

161
00:21:23,0 --> 00:21:23,0
is

162
00:21:23,0 --> 00:21:23,0
nothing which

163
00:21:23,0 --> 00:21:23,0
is secret

164
00:21:23,0 --> 00:21:23,0
save it

165
00:21:23,0 --> 00:21:23,0
shall be

166
00:21:23,0 --> 00:21:23,0
revealed;

167
00:21:23,0 --> 00:21:23,0
there is

168
00:21:23,0 --> 00:21:23,0
no work

169
00:21:23,0 --> 00:21:23,0
of

170
00:21:23,0 --> 00:21:23,0
darkness save it

171
00:21:23,0 --> 00:21:23,0
shall be

172
00:21:23,0 --> 00:21:23,0
made

173
00:21:23,0 --> 00:21:23,0
manifest in

174
00:21:23,0 --> 00:21:23,0
the

175
00:21:23,0 --> 00:21:23,0
light; and

176
00:21:23,0 --> 00:21:23,0
there is

177
00:21:23,0 --> 00:21:23,0
nothing

178
00:21:23,0 --> 00:21:23,0
which is

179
00:21:23,0 --> 00:21:23,0
sealed upon

180
00:21:23,0 --> 00:21:23,0
the earth

181
00:21:23,0 --> 00:21:09,
save it shall be loosed.

182
00:21:09,0 --> 00:21:09,0
18

183
00:21:09,0 --> 00:21:09,0
Wherefore,

184
00:21:09,0 --> 00:21:09,0
all things

185
00:21:09,0 --> 00:21:09,0
which

186
00:21:09,0 --> 00:21:09,0
have been

187
00:21:09,0 --> 00:21:09,0


188
00:21:09,0 --> 00:21:09,0
revealed unto

189
00:21:09,0 --> 00:21:09,0
the

190
00:21:09,0 --> 00:21:09,0
children of

191
00:21:09,0 --> 00:21:09,0
men shall

192
00:21:09,0 --> 00:21:09,0
at that

193
00:21:09,0 --> 00:21:09,0
day be

194
00:21:09,0 --> 00:21:09,0


195
00:21:09,0 --> 00:21:09,0
revealed; and

196
00:21:09,0 --> 00:21:09,0
Satan

197
00:21:09,0 --> 00:21:09,0
shall have

198
00:21:09,0 --> 00:21:09,0
power

199
00:21:09,0 --> 00:21:09,0
over the

200
00:21:09,0 --> 00:21:09,0
hearts of

201
00:21:09,0 --> 00:21:09,0
the

202
00:21:09,0 --> 00:21:09,0
children of

203
00:21:09,0 --> 00:21:09,0
men no

204
00:21:09,0 --> 00:21:09,0
more, for

205
00:21:09,0 --> 00:21:09,0
a long

206
00:21:09,0 --> 00:21:09,0
time.

207
00:21:09,0 --> 00:21:09,0
And now,

208
00:21:09,0 --> 00:21:09,0
my

209
00:21:09,0 --> 00:21:09,0
beloved

210
00:21:09,0 --> 00:22:53,
brethren, I make an end of my sayings.
