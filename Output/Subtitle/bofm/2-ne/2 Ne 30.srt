1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,4
Chapter 30 Converted Gentiles will be numbered

2
00:00:01,4 --> 00:00:02,8
 with the covenant people—Many Lamanites and Jews will

3
00:00:02,8 --> 00:00:04,2
 believe the word and become delightsome—Israel

4
00:00:04,2 --> 00:00:05,6
 will be restored and the wicked destroyed. About

5
00:00:05,6 --> 00:00:07,0
 559–545 B.C.

6
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:08,975
1 And now behold, my beloved brethren, I would

7
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:09,975
 speak unto you; for I, Nephi, would not suffer that

8
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:10,975
 ye should suppose that ye are more righteous than

9
00:00:10,975 --> 00:00:11,975
 the Gentiles shall be. For behold, except ye shall

10
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:12,975
 keep the commandments of God ye shall all likewise

11
00:00:12,975 --> 00:00:13,975
 perish; and because of the words which have been

12
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:14,975
 spoken ye need not suppose that the Gentiles are

13
00:00:14,975 --> 00:00:15,975
 utterly destroyed

14
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,282
2 For behold, I say unto you that as many of the

15
00:00:17,282 --> 00:00:18,615
 Gentiles as will repent are the covenant people of

16
00:00:18,615 --> 00:00:19,948
 the Lord; and as many of the Jews as will not

17
00:00:19,948 --> 00:00:21,281
 repent shall be cast off; for the Lord covenanteth

18
00:00:21,281 --> 00:00:22,614
 with none save it be with them that repent and

19
00:00:22,614 --> 00:00:23,947
 believe in his Son, who is the Holy One of Israel

20
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,067
3 And now, I would prophesy somewhat more

21
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:26,21
 concerning the Jews and the Gentiles. For after the book

22
00:00:26,21 --> 00:00:27,353
 of which I have spoken shall come forth, and be

23
00:00:27,353 --> 00:00:28,496
 written unto the Gentiles, and sealed up again unto

24
00:00:28,496 --> 00:00:29,639
 the Lord, there shall be many which shall believe

25
00:00:29,639 --> 00:00:30,782
 the words which are written; and they shall carry

26
00:00:30,782 --> 00:00:31,925
 them forth unto the remnant of our seed

27
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:34,566
4 And then shall the remnant of our seed know

28
00:00:34,566 --> 00:00:37,233
 concerning us, how that we came out from Jerusalem,

29
00:00:37,233 --> 00:00:39,9
 and that they are descendants of the Jews

30
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,473
5 And the gospel of Jesus Christ shall be declared

31
00:00:41,473 --> 00:00:43,073
 among them; wherefore, they shall be restored

32
00:00:43,073 --> 00:00:44,673
 unto the knowledge of their fathers, and also to the

33
00:00:44,673 --> 00:00:46,273
 knowledge of Jesus Christ, which was had among

34
00:00:46,273 --> 00:00:47,873
 their fathers

35
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,975
8 And it shall come to pass that the Lord God

36
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:11,975
 shall commence his work among all nations, kindreds,

37
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:13,975
 tongues, and people, to bring about the restoration

38
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:15,975
 of his people upon the earth

39
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,549
9 And with righteousness shall the Lord God judge

40
00:00:17,549 --> 00:00:19,149
 the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of

41
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:20,749
 the earth. And he shall smite the earth with the

42
00:00:20,749 --> 00:00:22,349
 rod of his mouth; and with the breath of his lips

43
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:23,949
 shall he slay the wicked

44
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,524
10 For the time speedily cometh that the Lord God

45
00:00:25,524 --> 00:00:27,124
 shall cause a great division among the people, and

46
00:00:27,124 --> 00:00:28,724
 the wicked will he destroy; and he will spare his

47
00:00:28,724 --> 00:00:30,324
 people, yea, even if it so be that he must

48
00:00:30,324 --> 00:00:31,924
 destroy the wicked by fire

49
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:35,899
11 And righteousness shall be the girdle of his

50
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:39,899
 loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins

51
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,873
12 And then shall the wolf dwell with the lamb;

52
00:00:41,873 --> 00:00:43,873
 and the leopard shall lie down with the kid, and the

53
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:45,873
 calf, and the young lion, and the fatling,

54
00:00:45,873 --> 00:00:47,873
 together; and a little child shall lead them

55
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:10,642
15 They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy

56
00:00:10,642 --> 00:00:13,309
 mountain; for the earth shall be full of the

57
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:15,976
 knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea

58
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,616
16 Wherefore, the things of all nations shall be

59
00:00:18,616 --> 00:00:21,283
 made known; yea, all things shall be made known

60
00:00:21,283 --> 00:00:23,95
 unto the children of men

61
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,524
17 There is nothing which is secret save it shall

62
00:00:25,524 --> 00:00:27,124
 be revealed; there is no work of darkness save it

63
00:00:27,124 --> 00:00:28,724
 shall be made manifest in the light; and there is

64
00:00:28,724 --> 00:00:30,324
 nothing which is sealed upon the earth save it

65
00:00:30,324 --> 00:00:31,924
 shall be loosed

66
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,232
18 Wherefore, all things which have been revealed

67
00:00:33,232 --> 00:00:34,565
 unto the children of men shall at that day be

68
00:00:34,565 --> 00:00:35,898
 revealed; and Satan shall have power over the hearts

69
00:00:35,898 --> 00:00:37,231
 of the children of men no more, for a long time.

70
00:00:37,231 --> 00:00:38,564
 And now, my beloved brethren, I make an end of my

71
00:00:38,564 --> 00:00:39,897
 sayings.
