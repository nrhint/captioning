00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 15 The Lord’s vineyard (Israel) will

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
become desolate, and His people will be

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
scattered—Woes will come upon them in their apostate and

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
scattered state—The Lord will lift an ensign and

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:03:31,
gather Israel—Compare 
Isaiah 5. About 559–545 B.C. 

6
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
1 And then will I sing to my well-beloved a

7
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
song of my beloved, touching his vineyard. My

8
00:03:31,0 --> 00:05:01,
well-beloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill.

9
00:05:01,0 --> 00:05:01,0
2 And he fenced it, and gathered out the

10
00:05:01,0 --> 00:05:01,0
stones thereof, and planted it with the

11
00:05:01,0 --> 00:05:01,0
choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst

12
00:05:01,0 --> 00:05:01,0
of it, and also made a wine-press

13
00:05:01,0 --> 00:05:01,0
therein; and he looked that it should bring forth

14
00:05:01,0 --> 00:11:41,
grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.

15
00:11:41,0 --> 00:11:41,0
3 And now, O inhabitants of

16
00:11:41,0 --> 00:11:41,0
Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I

17
00:11:41,0 --> 00:11:55,
pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.

18
00:11:55,0 --> 00:11:55,0
4 What could have been done more

19
00:11:55,0 --> 00:11:55,0
to my vineyard that I have not

20
00:11:55,0 --> 00:11:55,0
done in it? Wherefore, when I

21
00:11:55,0 --> 00:11:55,0
looked that it should bring forth

22
00:11:55,0 --> 00:16:23,
grapes it brought forth wild grapes.

23
00:16:23,0 --> 00:16:23,0
5 And now go to; I will

24
00:16:23,0 --> 00:16:23,0
tell you what I will do to my

25
00:16:23,0 --> 00:16:23,0
vineyard—I will take away

26
00:16:23,0 --> 00:16:23,0
the hedge thereof, and it

27
00:16:23,0 --> 00:16:23,0
shall be eaten up; and I will

28
00:16:23,0 --> 00:16:23,0
break down the wall

29
00:16:23,0 --> 00:20:51,
thereof, and it shall be trodden down;

30
00:20:51,0 --> 00:20:51,0
6 And I will lay it

31
00:20:51,0 --> 00:20:51,0
waste; it shall not be

32
00:20:51,0 --> 00:20:51,0
pruned nor digged; but

33
00:20:51,0 --> 00:20:51,0
there shall come up briers

34
00:20:51,0 --> 00:20:51,0
and thorns; I will

35
00:20:51,0 --> 00:20:51,0
also command the clouds

36
00:20:51,0 --> 00:26:20,
that they rain no rain upon it.

37
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
7 For the vineyard of

38
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
the Lord of Hosts is

39
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
the house of Israel,

40
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
and the men of Judah

41
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
his pleasant plant;

42
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
and he looked for

43
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
judgment, and behold,

44
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
oppression; for

45
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:06,
righteousness, but behold, a cry.

46
00:26:06,0 --> 00:26:06,0
8 Wo unto them that

47
00:26:06,0 --> 00:26:06,0
join house to house,

48
00:26:06,0 --> 00:26:06,0
till there can be

49
00:26:06,0 --> 00:26:06,0
no place, that they

50
00:26:06,0 --> 00:26:06,0
may be placed alone

51
00:26:06,0 --> 00:27:04,
in the midst of the earth!

52
00:27:04,0 --> 00:27:04,0
9 In mine ears,

53
00:27:04,0 --> 00:27:04,0
said the Lord of

54
00:27:04,0 --> 00:27:04,0
Hosts, of a truth

55
00:27:04,0 --> 00:27:04,0
many houses shall be

56
00:27:04,0 --> 00:27:04,0
desolate, and

57
00:27:04,0 --> 00:27:04,0
great and fair cities

58
00:27:04,0 --> 00:29:16,
without inhabitant.

59
00:29:16,0 --> 00:29:16,0
10 Yea, ten

60
00:29:16,0 --> 00:29:16,0
acres of vineyard

61
00:29:16,0 --> 00:29:16,0
shall yield one

62
00:29:16,0 --> 00:29:16,0
bath, and the seed

63
00:29:16,0 --> 00:29:16,0
of a homer

64
00:29:16,0 --> 00:31:00,
shall yield an ephah.

65
00:31:00,0 --> 00:31:00,0
11 Wo unto them

66
00:31:00,0 --> 00:31:00,0
that rise up

67
00:31:00,0 --> 00:31:00,0
early in the

68
00:31:00,0 --> 00:31:00,0
morning, that they

69
00:31:00,0 --> 00:31:00,0
may follow

70
00:31:00,0 --> 00:31:00,0
strong drink, that

71
00:31:00,0 --> 00:31:00,0
continue until

72
00:31:00,0 --> 00:31:00,0
night, and

73
00:31:00,0 --> 00:41:39,
wine inflame them!

74
00:41:39,0 --> 00:41:39,0
12 And the

75
00:41:39,0 --> 00:41:39,0
harp, and the

76
00:41:39,0 --> 00:41:39,0
viol, the tabret,

77
00:41:39,0 --> 00:41:39,0
and pipe, and

78
00:41:39,0 --> 00:41:39,0
wine are in

79
00:41:39,0 --> 00:41:39,0
their feasts;

80
00:41:39,0 --> 00:41:39,0
but they regard

81
00:41:39,0 --> 00:41:39,0
not the work

82
00:41:39,0 --> 00:41:39,0
of the Lord,

83
00:41:39,0 --> 00:41:39,0
neither

84
00:41:39,0 --> 00:41:39,0
consider the

85
00:41:39,0 --> 00:41:25,
operation of his hands.

86
00:41:25,0 --> 00:41:25,0
13 Therefore,

87
00:41:25,0 --> 00:41:25,0
my people

88
00:41:25,0 --> 00:41:25,0
are gone into

89
00:41:25,0 --> 00:41:25,0
captivity,

90
00:41:25,0 --> 00:41:25,0
because they

91
00:41:25,0 --> 00:41:25,0
have no

92
00:41:25,0 --> 00:41:25,0
knowledge; and their

93
00:41:25,0 --> 00:41:25,0
honorable men

94
00:41:25,0 --> 00:41:25,0
are

95
00:41:25,0 --> 00:41:25,0
famished, and their

96
00:41:25,0 --> 00:41:25,0
multitude

97
00:41:25,0 --> 00:42:09,
dried up with thirst.

98
00:42:09,0 --> 00:42:09,0
14

99
00:42:09,0 --> 00:42:09,0
Therefore, hell hath

100
00:42:09,0 --> 00:42:09,0
enlarged

101
00:42:09,0 --> 00:42:09,0
herself, and

102
00:42:09,0 --> 00:42:09,0
opened her

103
00:42:09,0 --> 00:42:09,0
mouth without

104
00:42:09,0 --> 00:42:09,0
measure; and

105
00:42:09,0 --> 00:42:09,0
their glory,

106
00:42:09,0 --> 00:42:09,0
and their

107
00:42:09,0 --> 00:42:09,0
multitude,

108
00:42:09,0 --> 00:42:09,0
and their

109
00:42:09,0 --> 00:42:09,0
pomp, and he

110
00:42:09,0 --> 00:42:09,0
that rejoiceth,

111
00:42:09,0 --> 00:46:52,
shall descend into it.

112
00:46:52,0 --> 00:46:52,0
15 And the

113
00:46:52,0 --> 00:46:52,0
mean man

114
00:46:52,0 --> 00:46:52,0
shall be

115
00:46:52,0 --> 00:46:52,0
brought down,

116
00:46:52,0 --> 00:46:52,0
and the

117
00:46:52,0 --> 00:46:52,0
mighty man

118
00:46:52,0 --> 00:46:52,0
shall be

119
00:46:52,0 --> 00:46:52,0
humbled, and the

120
00:46:52,0 --> 00:46:52,0
eyes of the

121
00:46:52,0 --> 00:46:52,0
lofty

122
00:46:52,0 --> 01:00:19,
shall be humbled.

123
01:00:19,0 --> 01:00:19,0
16 But the

124
01:00:19,0 --> 01:00:19,0
Lord of

125
01:00:19,0 --> 01:00:19,0
Hosts shall

126
01:00:19,0 --> 01:00:19,0
be

127
01:00:19,0 --> 01:00:19,0
exalted in

128
01:00:19,0 --> 01:00:19,0
judgment, and

129
01:00:19,0 --> 01:00:19,0
God that is

130
01:00:19,0 --> 01:00:19,0
holy

131
01:00:19,0 --> 01:00:19,0
shall be

132
01:00:19,0 --> 01:00:19,0
sanctified in

133
01:00:19,0 --> 01:04:48,
righteousness.

134
01:04:48,0 --> 01:04:48,0
17 Then

135
01:04:48,0 --> 01:04:48,0
shall the

136
01:04:48,0 --> 01:04:48,0
lambs

137
01:04:48,0 --> 01:04:48,0
feed after

138
01:04:48,0 --> 01:04:48,0
their

139
01:04:48,0 --> 01:04:48,0
manner, and

140
01:04:48,0 --> 01:04:48,0
the waste

141
01:04:48,0 --> 01:04:48,0
places of

142
01:04:48,0 --> 01:04:48,0
the fat

143
01:04:48,0 --> 01:04:48,0
ones

144
01:04:48,0 --> 01:09:45,
shall strangers eat.

145
01:09:45,0 --> 01:09:45,0
18 Wo

146
01:09:45,0 --> 01:09:45,0
unto them

147
01:09:45,0 --> 01:09:45,0
that

148
01:09:45,0 --> 01:09:45,0
draw

149
01:09:45,0 --> 01:09:45,0
iniquity with

150
01:09:45,0 --> 01:09:45,0
cords of

151
01:09:45,0 --> 01:09:45,0
vanity,

152
01:09:45,0 --> 01:09:45,0
and sin

153
01:09:45,0 --> 01:09:45,0
as it

154
01:09:45,0 --> 01:09:45,0
were with

155
01:09:45,0 --> 01:16:26,
a cart rope;

156
01:16:26,0 --> 01:16:26,0
19 That

157
01:16:26,0 --> 01:16:26,0
say:

158
01:16:26,0 --> 01:16:26,0
Let him

159
01:16:26,0 --> 01:16:26,0
make

160
01:16:26,0 --> 01:16:26,0
speed,

161
01:16:26,0 --> 01:16:26,0
hasten

162
01:16:26,0 --> 01:16:26,0
his work,

163
01:16:26,0 --> 01:16:26,0
that

164
01:16:26,0 --> 01:16:26,0
we may

165
01:16:26,0 --> 01:16:26,0
see it;

166
01:16:26,0 --> 01:16:26,0
and let

167
01:16:26,0 --> 01:16:26,0
the

168
01:16:26,0 --> 01:16:26,0
counsel

169
01:16:26,0 --> 01:16:26,0
of the

170
01:16:26,0 --> 01:16:26,0
Holy One

171
01:16:26,0 --> 01:16:26,0
of

172
01:16:26,0 --> 01:16:26,0
Israel

173
01:16:26,0 --> 01:16:26,0
draw nigh

174
01:16:26,0 --> 01:16:26,0
and

175
01:16:26,0 --> 01:18:10,
come, that we may know it.

176
01:18:10,0 --> 01:18:10,0
20 Wo

177
01:18:10,0 --> 01:18:10,0
unto

178
01:18:10,0 --> 01:18:10,0
them

179
01:18:10,0 --> 01:18:10,0
that

180
01:18:10,0 --> 01:18:10,0
call evil

181
01:18:10,0 --> 01:18:10,0
good,

182
01:18:10,0 --> 01:18:10,0
and

183
01:18:10,0 --> 01:18:10,0
good

184
01:18:10,0 --> 01:18:10,0
evil,

185
01:18:10,0 --> 01:18:10,0
that put

186
01:18:10,0 --> 01:18:10,0


187
01:18:10,0 --> 01:18:10,0
darkness

188
01:18:10,0 --> 01:18:10,0
for

189
01:18:10,0 --> 01:18:10,0
light, and

190
01:18:10,0 --> 01:18:10,0
light

191
01:18:10,0 --> 01:18:10,0
for

192
01:18:10,0 --> 01:18:10,0


193
01:18:10,0 --> 01:18:10,0
darkness,

194
01:18:10,0 --> 01:18:10,0
that put

195
01:18:10,0 --> 01:18:10,0
bitter

196
01:18:10,0 --> 01:18:10,0
for

197
01:18:10,0 --> 01:19:54,
sweet, and sweet for bitter!

198
01:19:54,0 --> 01:19:54,0
21 Wo

199
01:19:54,0 --> 01:19:54,0
unto

200
01:19:54,0 --> 01:19:54,0
the

01:19:54,0 --> 01:19:54,0
wise

202
01:19:54,0 --> 01:19:54,0

206
01:19:54,0 --> 01:19:54,0
and

207
01:19:54,0 --> 01:19:54,0
prudent

208
01:19:54,0 --> 01:19:54,0
in

209
01:19:54,0 --> 01:19:26,
their own sight!

210
01:19:26,0 --> 01:19:26,0
22 Wo

211
01:19:26,0 --> 01:19:26,0
unto

212
01:19:26,0 --> 01:19:26,0
the

214
01:19:26,0 --> 01:19:26,0
mighty to

215
01:19:26,0 --> 01:19:26,0
drink

216
01:19:26,0 --> 01:19:26,0


217
01:19:26,0 --> 01:19:26,0
wine, and

218
01:19:26,0 --> 01:19:26,0
men

219
01:19:26,0 --> 01:19:26,0
of

220
01:19:26,0 --> 01:19:26,0


221
01:19:26,0 --> 01:19:26,0
strength to

223
01:19:26,0 --> 01:19:26,0
