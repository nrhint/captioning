00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:03,6
Chapter 15 The Lord’s vineyard (Israel) will

2
00:00:03,6 --> 00:00:07,2
become desolate, and His people will be

3
00:00:07,2 --> 00:00:10,8
scattered—Woes will come upon them in their apostate and

4
00:00:10,8 --> 00:00:14,4
scattered state—The Lord will lift an ensign and

5
00:00:14,4 --> 00:00:18,318
gather Israel—Compare 
Isaiah 5. About 559–545 B.C. 

6
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:19,651
1 And then will I sing to my well-beloved a

7
00:00:19,651 --> 00:00:20,984
song of my beloved, touching his vineyard. My

8
00:00:20,984 --> 00:00:22,723
well-beloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill.

9
00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:23,556
2 And he fenced it, and gathered out the

10
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:24,389
stones thereof, and planted it with the

11
00:00:24,389 --> 00:00:25,222
choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst

12
00:00:25,222 --> 00:00:26,055
of it, and also made a wine-press

13
00:00:26,055 --> 00:00:26,888
therein; and he looked that it should bring forth

14
00:00:26,888 --> 00:00:27,127
grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.

15
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:31,127
3 And now, O inhabitants of

16
00:00:31,127 --> 00:00:35,127
Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I

17
00:00:35,127 --> 00:00:39,506
pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.

18
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:41,906
4 What could have been done more

19
00:00:41,906 --> 00:00:44,306
to my vineyard that I have not

20
00:00:44,306 --> 00:00:46,706
done in it? Wherefore, when I

21
00:00:46,706 --> 00:00:49,106
looked that it should bring forth

22
00:00:49,106 --> 00:00:51,885
grapes it brought forth wild grapes.

23
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
5 And now go to; I will

24
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
tell you what I will do to my

25
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
vineyard—I will take away

26
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
the hedge thereof, and it

27
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
shall be eaten up; and I will

28
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
break down the wall

29
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
thereof, and it shall be trodden down;

30
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
6 And I will lay it

31
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
waste; it shall not be

32
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
pruned nor digged; but

33
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
there shall come up briers

34
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
and thorns; I will

35
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
also command the clouds

36
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
that they rain no rain upon it.

37
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
7 For the vineyard of

38
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
the Lord of Hosts is

39
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
the house of Israel,

40
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
and the men of Judah

41
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
his pleasant plant;

42
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
and he looked for

43
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
judgment, and behold,

44
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
oppression; for

45
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
righteousness, but behold, a cry.

46
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
8 Wo unto them that

47
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
join house to house,

48
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
till there can be

49
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
no place, that they

50
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
may be placed alone

51
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
in the midst of the earth!

52
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
9 In mine ears,

53
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
said the Lord of

54
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
Hosts, of a truth

55
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
many houses shall be

56
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
desolate, and

57
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
great and fair cities

58
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
without inhabitant.

59
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
10 Yea, ten

60
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
acres of vineyard

61
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
shall yield one

62
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
bath, and the seed

63
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
of a homer

64
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
shall yield an ephah.

65
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
11 Wo unto them

66
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
that rise up

67
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
early in the

68
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
morning, that they

69
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
may follow

70
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
strong drink, that

71
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
continue until

72
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
night, and

73
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
wine inflame them!

74
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
12 And the

75
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
harp, and the

76
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
viol, the tabret,

77
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
and pipe, and

78
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
wine are in

79
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
their feasts;

80
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
but they regard

81
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
not the work

82
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
of the Lord,

83
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
neither

84
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
consider the

85
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
operation of his hands.

86
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
13 Therefore,

87
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
my people

88
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
are gone into

89
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
captivity,

90
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
because they

91
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
have no

92
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
knowledge; and their

93
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
honorable men

94
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
are

95
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
famished, and their

96
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
multitude

97
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
dried up with thirst.

98
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
14

99
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
Therefore, hell hath

100
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
enlarged

101
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
herself, and

102
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
opened her

103
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
mouth without

104
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
measure; and

105
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
their glory,

106
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
and their

107
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
multitude,

108
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
and their

109
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
pomp, and he

110
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
that rejoiceth,

111
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
shall descend into it.

112
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
15 And the

113
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
mean man

114
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
shall be

115
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
brought down,

116
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
and the

117
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
mighty man

118
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
shall be

119
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
humbled, and the

120
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
eyes of the

121
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
lofty

122
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
shall be humbled.

123
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
16 But the

124
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
Lord of

125
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
Hosts shall

126
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
be

127
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
exalted in

128
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
judgment, and

129
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
God that is

130
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
holy

131
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
shall be

132
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
sanctified in

133
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
righteousness.

134
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
17 Then

135
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
shall the

136
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
lambs

137
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
feed after

138
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
their

139
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
manner, and

140
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
the waste

141
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
places of

142
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
the fat

143
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
ones

144
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
shall strangers eat.

145
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
18 Wo

146
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
unto them

147
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
that

148
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
draw

149
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
iniquity with

150
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
cords of

151
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
vanity,

152
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
and sin

153
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
as it

154
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
were with

155
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
a cart rope;

156
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
19 That

157
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
say:

158
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
Let him

159
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
make

160
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
speed,

161
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
hasten

162
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
his work,

163
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
that

164
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
we may

165
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
see it;

166
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
and let

167
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
the

168
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
counsel

169
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
of the

170
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
Holy One

171
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
of

172
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
Israel

173
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
draw nigh

174
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
and

175
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
come, that we may know it.

176
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
20 Wo

177
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
unto

178
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
them

179
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
that

180
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
call evil

181
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
good,

182
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
and

183
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
good

184
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
evil,

185
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
that put

186
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885


187
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
darkness

188
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
for

189
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
light, and

190
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
light

191
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
for

192
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885


193
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
darkness,

194
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
that put

195
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
bitter

196
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
for

197
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
sweet, and sweet for bitter!

198
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
21 Wo

199
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
unto

200
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
the

201
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
wise

202
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
in

203
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,885
