00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,4
Chapter 15 The Lord’s vineyard (Israel) will

2
00:00:01,4 --> 00:00:02,8
 become desolate, and His people will be scattered—Woes

3
00:00:02,8 --> 00:00:04,2
 will come upon them in their apostate and

4
00:00:04,2 --> 00:00:05,6
 scattered state—The Lord will lift an ensign and gather

5
00:00:05,6 --> 00:00:07,0
 Israel—Compare 
Isaiah 5. About 559–545 B.C.

6
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:10,642
1 And then will I sing to my well-beloved a song

7
00:00:10,642 --> 00:00:13,309
 of my beloved, touching his vineyard. My

8
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:15,976
 well-beloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill

9
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,282
2 And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones

10
00:00:17,282 --> 00:00:18,615
 thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and

11
00:00:18,615 --> 00:00:19,948
 built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a

12
00:00:19,948 --> 00:00:21,281
 wine-press therein; and he looked that it should

13
00:00:21,281 --> 00:00:22,614
 bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild

14
00:00:22,614 --> 00:00:23,947
 grapes

15
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:26,591
3 And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of

16
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:29,258
 Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my

17
00:00:29,258 --> 00:00:31,925
 vineyard

18
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,899
4 What could have been done more to my vineyard

19
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,899
 that I have not done in it? Wherefore, when I looked

20
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:37,899
 that it should bring forth grapes it brought

21
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:39,899
 forth wild grapes

22
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,873
5 And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to

23
00:00:41,873 --> 00:00:43,873
 my vineyard—I will take away the hedge thereof,

24
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:45,873
 and it shall be eaten up; and I will break down the

25
00:00:45,873 --> 00:00:47,873
 wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down

26
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,848
6 And I will lay it waste; it shall not be pruned

27
00:00:49,848 --> 00:00:51,848
 nor digged; but there shall come up briers and

28
00:00:51,848 --> 00:00:53,848
 thorns; I will also command the clouds that they rain

29
00:00:53,848 --> 00:00:55,848
 no rain upon it

30
00:00:55,822 --> 00:01:07,822
7 For the vineyard of the Lord of Hosts is the

31
00:01:07,822 --> 00:01:19,822
 house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant

32
00:01:19,822 --> 00:01:31,822
 plant; and he looked for judgment, and behold,

33
00:01:31,822 --> 00:01:43,822
 oppression; for righteousness, but behold, a cry

34
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:49,003
8 Wo unto them that join house to house, till

35
00:01:49,003 --> 00:01:54,336
 there can be no place, that they may be placed alone

36
00:01:54,336 --> 00:01:59,669
 in the midst of the earth

37
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:23,62
9 In mine ears, said the Lord of Hosts, of a truth

38
00:02:23,62 --> 00:02:47,62
 many houses shall be desolate, and great and fair

39
00:02:47,62 --> 00:03:11,62
 cities without inhabitant

40
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:47,391
10 Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one

41
00:03:47,391 --> 00:04:23,391
 bath, and the seed of a homer shall yield an ephah

42
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:25,83
11 Wo unto them that rise up early in the morning,

43
00:04:25,83 --> 00:04:28,497
 that they may follow strong drink, that continue

44
00:04:28,497 --> 00:04:31,164
 until night, and wine inflame them

45
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:37,138
12 And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and

46
00:04:37,138 --> 00:04:43,138
 pipe, and wine are in their feasts; but they regard

47
00:04:43,138 --> 00:04:49,138
 not the work of the Lord, neither consider the

48
00:04:49,138 --> 00:04:55,138
 operation of his hands

49
00:04:55,061 --> 00:05:02,811
13 Therefore, my people are gone into captivity,

50
00:05:02,811 --> 00:05:10,561
 because they have no knowledge; and their honorable

51
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:18,311
 men are famished, and their multitude dried up

52
00:05:18,311 --> 00:05:26,061
 with thirst

53
00:05:26,96 --> 00:06:30,96
14 Therefore, hell hath enlarged herself, and

54
00:06:30,96 --> 00:07:34,96
 opened her mouth without measure; and their glory, and

55
00:07:34,96 --> 00:08:38,96
 their multitude, and their pomp, and he that

56
00:08:38,96 --> 00:09:42,96
 rejoiceth, shall descend into it

57
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,815
15 And the mean man shall be brought down, and the

58
00:09:44,815 --> 00:09:47,482
 mighty man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the

59
00:09:47,482 --> 00:09:50,149
 lofty shall be humbled

60
00:09:50,123 --> 00:11:12,456
16 But the Lord of Hosts shall be exalted in

61
00:11:12,456 --> 00:12:34,789
 judgment, and God that is holy shall be sanctified in

62
00:12:34,789 --> 00:13:57,122
 righteousness

63
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:05,337
17 Then shall the lambs feed after their manner,

64
00:14:05,337 --> 00:14:13,337
 and the waste places of the fat ones shall

65
00:14:13,337 --> 00:14:21,337
 strangers eat

66
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,975
20 Wo unto them that call evil good, and good

67
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:11,975
 evil, that put darkness for light, and light for

68
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:13,975
 darkness, that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for

69
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:15,975
 bitter

70
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:19,949
21 Wo unto the wise in their own eyes and prudent

71
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:23,949
 in their own sight

72
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:27,924
22 Wo unto the mighty to drink wine, and men of

73
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:31,924
 strength to mingle strong drink

74
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:35,899
23 Who justify the wicked for reward, and take

75
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:39,899
 away the righteousness of the righteous from him

76
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,206
24 Therefore, as the fire devoureth the stubble,

77
00:00:41,206 --> 00:00:42,539
 and the flame consumeth the chaff, their root shall

78
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:43,872
 be rottenness, and their blossoms shall go up as

79
00:00:43,872 --> 00:00:45,205
 dust; because they have cast away the law of the

80
00:00:45,205 --> 00:00:46,538
 Lord of Hosts, and despised the word of the Holy

81
00:00:46,538 --> 00:00:47,871
 One of Israel

82
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:48,991
25 Therefore, is the anger of the Lord kindled

83
00:00:48,991 --> 00:00:50,134
 against his people, and he hath stretched forth his

84
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:51,277
 hand against them, and hath smitten them; and the

85
00:00:51,277 --> 00:00:52,42
 hills did tremble, and their carcasses were torn in

86
00:00:52,42 --> 00:00:53,563
 the midst of the streets. For all this his anger

87
00:00:53,563 --> 00:00:54,706
 is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out

88
00:00:54,706 --> 00:00:55,849
 still

89
00:00:55,822 --> 00:01:05,422
26 And he will lift up an ensign to the nations

90
00:01:05,422 --> 00:01:15,022
 from far, and will hiss unto them from the end of

91
00:01:15,022 --> 00:01:24,622
 the earth; and behold, they shall come with speed

92
00:01:24,622 --> 00:01:34,222
 swiftly; none shall be weary nor stumble among them

93
00:01:34,222 --> 00:01:43,822


94
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:49,003
27 None shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the

95
00:01:49,003 --> 00:01:54,336
 girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet

96
00:01:54,336 --> 00:01:59,669
 of their shoes be broken

97
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:17,62
28 Whose arrows shall be sharp, and all their bows

98
00:02:17,62 --> 00:02:35,62
 bent, and their horses’ hoofs shall be counted

99
00:02:35,62 --> 00:02:53,62
 like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind, their

100
00:02:53,62 --> 00:03:11,62
 roaring like a lion

101
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:35,391
29 They shall roar like young lions; yea, they

102
00:03:35,391 --> 00:03:59,391
 shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and shall carry

103
00:03:59,391 --> 00:04:23,391
 away safe, and none shall deliver

104
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:23,163
30 And in that day they shall roar against them

105
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:23,163
 like the roaring of the sea; and if they look unto

106
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:23,163
 the land, behold, darkness and sorrow, and the

107
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:23,163
 light is darkened in the heavens thereof.
