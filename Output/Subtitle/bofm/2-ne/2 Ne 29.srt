00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,4
Chapter 29 Many Gentiles will reject the Book of

2
00:00:01,4 --> 00:00:02,8
 Mormon—They will say, We need no more Bible—The

3
00:00:02,8 --> 00:00:04,2
 Lord speaks to many nations—He will judge the world

4
00:00:04,2 --> 00:00:05,6
 out of the books which will be written. About

5
00:00:05,6 --> 00:00:07,0
 559–545 B.C.

6
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,308
1 But behold, there shall be many—at that day when

7
00:00:09,308 --> 00:00:10,641
 I shall proceed to do a marvelous work among

8
00:00:10,641 --> 00:00:11,974
 them, that I may remember my covenants which I have

9
00:00:11,974 --> 00:00:13,307
 made unto the children of men, that I may set my

10
00:00:13,307 --> 00:00:14,64
 hand again the second time to recover my people,

11
00:00:14,64 --> 00:00:15,973
 which are of the house of Israel

12
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,092
2 And also, that I may remember the promises which

13
00:00:17,092 --> 00:00:18,235
 I have made unto thee, Nephi, and also unto thy

14
00:00:18,235 --> 00:00:19,378
 father, that I would remember your seed; and that

15
00:00:19,378 --> 00:00:20,521
 the words of your seed should proceed forth out of

16
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:21,664
 my mouth unto your seed; and my words shall hiss

17
00:00:21,664 --> 00:00:22,807
 forth unto the ends of the earth, for a standard

18
00:00:22,807 --> 00:00:23,95
 unto my people, which are of the house of Israel

19
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:26,591
3 And because my words shall hiss forth—many of

20
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:29,258
 the Gentiles shall say: A Bible! A Bible! We have

21
00:00:29,258 --> 00:00:31,925
 got a Bible, and there cannot be any more Bible

22
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:32,899
4 But thus saith the Lord God: O fools, they shall

23
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:33,899
 have a Bible; and it shall proceed forth from the

24
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:34,899
 Jews, mine ancient covenant people. And what

25
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:35,899
 thank they the Jews for the Bible which they receive

26
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:36,899
 from them? Yea, what do the Gentiles mean? Do they

27
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:37,899
 remember the travails, and the labors, and the

28
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:38,899
 pains of the Jews, and their diligence unto me, in

29
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:39,899
 bringing forth salvation unto the Gentiles

30
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,206
5 O ye Gentiles, have ye remembered the Jews, mine

31
00:00:41,206 --> 00:00:42,539
 ancient covenant people? Nay; but ye have cursed

32
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:43,872
 them, and have hated them, and have not sought to

33
00:00:43,872 --> 00:00:45,205
 recover them. But behold, I will return all these

34
00:00:45,205 --> 00:00:46,538
 things upon your own heads; for I the Lord have

35
00:00:46,538 --> 00:00:47,871
 not forgotten my people

36
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:08,975
8 Wherefore murmur ye, because that ye shall

37
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:09,975
 receive more of my word? Know ye not that the testimony

38
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:10,975
 of two nations is a witness unto you that I am

39
00:00:10,975 --> 00:00:11,975
 God, that I remember one nation like unto another?

40
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:12,975
 Wherefore, I speak the same words unto one nation

41
00:00:12,975 --> 00:00:13,975
 like unto another. And when the two nations shall

42
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:14,975
 run together the testimony of the two nations shall

43
00:00:14,975 --> 00:00:15,975
 run together also

44
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:16,949
9 And I do this that I may prove unto many that I

45
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:17,949
 am the same yesterday, today, and forever; and

46
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:18,949
 that I speak forth my words according to mine own

47
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:19,949
 pleasure. And because that I have spoken one word ye

48
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:20,949
 need not suppose that I cannot speak another; for

49
00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:21,949
 my work is not yet finished; neither shall it be

50
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:22,949
 until the end of man, neither from that time

51
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:23,949
 henceforth and forever

52
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,924
10 Wherefore, because that ye have a Bible ye need

53
00:00:25,924 --> 00:00:27,924
 not suppose that it contains all my words;

54
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:29,924
 neither need ye suppose that I have not caused more to

55
00:00:29,924 --> 00:00:31,924
 be written

56
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,042
11 For I command all men, both in the east and in

57
00:00:33,042 --> 00:00:34,185
 the west, and in the north, and in the south, and

58
00:00:34,185 --> 00:00:35,328
 in the islands of the sea, that they shall write

59
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,471
 the words which I speak unto them; for out of the

60
00:00:36,471 --> 00:00:37,614
 books which shall be written I will judge the

61
00:00:37,614 --> 00:00:38,757
 world, every man according to their works, according to

62
00:00:38,757 --> 00:00:39,9
 that which is written

63
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,016
12 For behold, I shall speak unto the Jews and

64
00:00:41,016 --> 00:00:42,159
 they shall write it; and I shall also speak unto the

65
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:43,302
 Nephites and they shall write it; and I shall also

66
00:00:43,302 --> 00:00:44,445
 speak unto the other tribes of the house of

67
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:45,588
 Israel, which I have led away, and they shall write it;

68
00:00:45,588 --> 00:00:46,731
 and I shall also speak unto all nations of the

69
00:00:46,731 --> 00:00:47,874
 earth and they shall write it
