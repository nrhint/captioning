1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:03,2
Chapter 29 Many Gentiles will reject the

2
00:00:03,2 --> 00:00:06,4
Book of Mormon—They will say, We need no

3
00:00:06,4 --> 00:00:09,6
more Bible—The Lord speaks to many

4
00:00:09,6 --> 00:00:12,8
nations—He will judge the world out of the

5
00:00:12,8 --> 00:00:16,917
books which will be written. About 559–545 B.C. 

6
00:00:16,917 --> 00:00:17,917
1 But behold, there shall be many—at

7
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:18,917
that day when I shall proceed to do a

8
00:00:18,917 --> 00:00:19,917
marvelous work among them, that I may

9
00:00:19,917 --> 00:00:20,917
remember my covenants which I have made

10
00:00:20,917 --> 00:00:21,917
unto the children of men, that I may set

11
00:00:21,917 --> 00:00:22,917
my hand again the second time to recover

12
00:00:22,917 --> 00:00:23,257
my people, which are of the house of Israel;

13
00:00:23,257 --> 00:00:24,257
2 And also, that I may remember the

14
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:25,257
promises which I have made unto thee,

15
00:00:25,257 --> 00:00:26,257
Nephi, and also unto thy father, that I

16
00:00:26,257 --> 00:00:27,257
would remember your seed; and that the

17
00:00:27,257 --> 00:00:28,257
words of your seed should proceed

18
00:00:28,257 --> 00:00:29,257
forth out of my mouth unto your seed; and

19
00:00:29,257 --> 00:00:30,257
my words shall hiss forth unto the

20
00:00:30,257 --> 00:00:31,257
ends of the earth, for a standard unto

21
00:00:31,257 --> 00:00:32,232
my people, which are of the house of Israel;

22
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:33,982
3 And because my words shall hiss

23
00:00:33,982 --> 00:00:35,732
forth—many of the Gentiles shall say:

24
00:00:35,732 --> 00:00:37,482
A Bible! A Bible! We have got a

25
00:00:37,482 --> 00:00:39,239
Bible, and there cannot be any more Bible.

26
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:39,512
4 But thus saith the Lord God: O

27
00:00:39,512 --> 00:00:39,785
fools, they shall have a Bible; and

28
00:00:39,785 --> 00:00:40,058
it shall proceed forth from the

29
00:00:40,058 --> 00:00:40,331
Jews, mine ancient covenant people. And

30
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:40,604
what thank they the Jews for the

31
00:00:40,604 --> 00:00:40,877
Bible which they receive from them?

32
00:00:40,877 --> 00:00:41,15
Yea, what do the Gentiles mean? Do

33
00:00:41,15 --> 00:00:41,423
they remember the travails, and the

34
00:00:41,423 --> 00:00:41,696
labors, and the pains of the Jews,

35
00:00:41,696 --> 00:00:41,969
and their diligence unto me, in

36
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:42,709
bringing forth salvation unto the Gentiles?

37
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:42,834
5 O ye Gentiles, have ye

38
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:42,959
remembered the Jews, mine ancient covenant

39
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:43,084
people? Nay; but ye have cursed

40
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:43,209
them, and have hated them, and have

41
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:43,334
not sought to recover them. But

42
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:43,459
behold, I will return all these

43
00:00:43,459 --> 00:00:43,584
things upon your own heads; for I the

44
00:00:43,584 --> 00:00:43,176
Lord have not forgotten my people.

45
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
6 Thou fool, that shall say: A

46
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
Bible, we have got a Bible, and we

47
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
need no more Bible. Have ye obtained

48
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,644
a Bible save it were by the Jews?

49
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
7 Know ye not that there are more

50
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
nations than one? Know ye not

51
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
that I, the Lord your God, have

52
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
created all men, and that I remember

53
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
those who are upon the isles of

54
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
the sea; and that I rule in the

55
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
heavens above and in the earth

56
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
beneath; and I bring forth my word

57
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
unto the children of men, yea,

58
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,176
even upon all the nations of the earth?

59
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
8 Wherefore murmur ye, because

60
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
that ye shall receive more of

61
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
my word? Know ye not that the

62
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
testimony of two nations is a

63
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
witness unto you that I am

64
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
God, that I remember one nation

65
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
like unto another? Wherefore,

66
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
I speak the same words unto

67
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
one nation like unto another.

68
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
And when the two nations shall

69
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
run together the testimony of

70
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,644
the two nations shall run together also.

71
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
9 And I do this that I may

72
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
prove unto many that I am the

73
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
same yesterday, today, and

74
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
forever; and that I speak

75
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
forth my words according to

76
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
mine own pleasure. And because

77
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
that I have spoken one word

78
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
ye need not suppose that I

79
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
cannot speak another; for my

80
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
work is not yet finished;

81
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
neither shall it be until the

82
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
end of man, neither from

83
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,176
that time henceforth and forever.

84
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
10 Wherefore, because that

85
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
ye have a Bible ye need

86
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
not suppose that it

87
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
contains all my words; neither

88
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
need ye suppose that I have

89
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,644
not caused more to be written.

90
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
11 For I command all

91
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
men, both in the east and

92
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
in the west, and in the

93
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
north, and in the south,

94
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
and in the islands of

95
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
the sea, that they shall

96
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
write the words which I

97
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
speak unto them; for out

98
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
of the books which shall

99
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
be written I will judge

100
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
the world, every man

101
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
according to their works,

102
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,176
according to that which is written.

103
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
12 For behold, I shall

104
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
speak unto the Jews and

105
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
they shall write it;

106
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
and I shall also speak

107
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
unto the Nephites and

108
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
they shall write it; and

109
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
I shall also speak unto

110
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
the other tribes of

111
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
the house of Israel,

112
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
which I have led away, and

113
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
they shall write it;

114
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
and I shall also speak

115
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
unto all nations of the

116
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,644
earth and they shall write it.

117
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
13 And it shall come

118
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
to pass that the Jews

119
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
shall have the words of

120
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
the Nephites, and the

121
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
Nephites shall have

122
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
the words of the Jews;

123
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
and the Nephites and

124
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
the Jews shall have the

125
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
words of the lost

126
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
tribes of Israel; and the

127
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
lost tribes of Israel

128
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,644
shall have the words

129
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:43,176
of the Nephites and the Jews.

130
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
14 And it shall come

131
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
to pass that my

132
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
people, which are of the

133
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
house of Israel, shall

134
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
be gathered home

135
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
unto the lands of their

136
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
possessions; and my

137
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
word also shall be

138
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
gathered in one. And I

139
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
will show unto them

140
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
that fight against my

141
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
word and against my

142
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
people, who are of the

143
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
house of Israel, that

144
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
I am God, and that I

145
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
covenanted with

146
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,176
Abraham that I would

147
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:43,644
remember his seed forever.
