1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 29 Many Gentiles will reject the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Book of Mormon—They will say, We need no

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
more Bible—The Lord speaks to many

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
nations—He will judge the world out of the

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:09:09,
books which will be written. About 559–545 B.C. 

6
00:09:09,0 --> 00:09:09,0
1 But behold, there shall be many—at

7
00:09:09,0 --> 00:09:09,0
that day when I shall proceed to do a

8
00:09:09,0 --> 00:09:09,0
marvelous work among them, that I may

9
00:09:09,0 --> 00:09:09,0
remember my covenants which I have made

10
00:09:09,0 --> 00:09:09,0
unto the children of men, that I may set

11
00:09:09,0 --> 00:09:09,0
my hand again the second time to recover

12
00:09:09,0 --> 00:13:22,
my people, which are of the house of Israel;

13
00:13:22,0 --> 00:13:22,0
2 And also, that I may remember the

14
00:13:22,0 --> 00:13:22,0
promises which I have made unto thee,

15
00:13:22,0 --> 00:13:22,0
Nephi, and also unto thy father, that I

16
00:13:22,0 --> 00:13:22,0
would remember your seed; and that the

17
00:13:22,0 --> 00:13:22,0
words of your seed should proceed

18
00:13:22,0 --> 00:13:22,0
forth out of my mouth unto your seed; and

19
00:13:22,0 --> 00:13:22,0
my words shall hiss forth unto the

20
00:13:22,0 --> 00:13:22,0
ends of the earth, for a standard unto

21
00:13:22,0 --> 00:23:04,
my people, which are of the house of Israel;

22
00:23:04,0 --> 00:23:04,0
3 And because my words shall hiss

23
00:23:04,0 --> 00:23:04,0
forth—many of the Gentiles shall say:

24
00:23:04,0 --> 00:23:04,0
A Bible! A Bible! We have got a

25
00:23:04,0 --> 00:22:36,
Bible, and there cannot be any more Bible.

26
00:22:36,0 --> 00:22:36,0
4 But thus saith the Lord God: O

27
00:22:36,0 --> 00:22:36,0
fools, they shall have a Bible; and

28
00:22:36,0 --> 00:22:36,0
it shall proceed forth from the

29
00:22:36,0 --> 00:22:36,0
Jews, mine ancient covenant people. And

30
00:22:36,0 --> 00:22:36,0
what thank they the Jews for the

31
00:22:36,0 --> 00:22:36,0
Bible which they receive from them?

32
00:22:36,0 --> 00:22:36,0
Yea, what do the Gentiles mean? Do

33
00:22:36,0 --> 00:22:36,0
they remember the travails, and the

34
00:22:36,0 --> 00:22:36,0
labors, and the pains of the Jews,

35
00:22:36,0 --> 00:22:36,0
and their diligence unto me, in

36
00:22:36,0 --> 00:24:48,
bringing forth salvation unto the Gentiles?

37
00:24:48,0 --> 00:24:48,0
5 O ye Gentiles, have ye

38
00:24:48,0 --> 00:24:48,0
remembered the Jews, mine ancient covenant

39
00:24:48,0 --> 00:24:48,0
people? Nay; but ye have cursed

40
00:24:48,0 --> 00:24:48,0
them, and have hated them, and have

41
00:24:48,0 --> 00:24:48,0
not sought to recover them. But

42
00:24:48,0 --> 00:24:48,0
behold, I will return all these

43
00:24:48,0 --> 00:24:48,0
things upon your own heads; for I the

44
00:24:48,0 --> 00:32:46,
Lord have not forgotten my people.

45
00:32:46,0 --> 00:32:46,0
6 Thou fool, that shall say: A

46
00:32:46,0 --> 00:32:46,0
Bible, we have got a Bible, and we

47
00:32:46,0 --> 00:32:46,0
need no more Bible. Have ye obtained

48
00:32:46,0 --> 00:41:14,
a Bible save it were by the Jews?

49
00:41:14,0 --> 00:41:14,0
7 Know ye not that there are more

50
00:41:14,0 --> 00:41:14,0
nations than one? Know ye not

51
00:41:14,0 --> 00:41:14,0
that I, the Lord your God, have

52
00:41:14,0 --> 00:41:14,0
created all men, and that I remember

53
00:41:14,0 --> 00:41:14,0
those who are upon the isles of

54
00:41:14,0 --> 00:41:14,0
the sea; and that I rule in the

55
00:41:14,0 --> 00:41:14,0
heavens above and in the earth

56
00:41:14,0 --> 00:41:14,0
beneath; and I bring forth my word

57
00:41:14,0 --> 00:41:14,0
unto the children of men, yea,

58
00:41:14,0 --> 00:40:46,
even upon all the nations of the earth?

59
00:40:46,0 --> 00:40:46,0
8 Wherefore murmur ye, because

60
00:40:46,0 --> 00:40:46,0
that ye shall receive more of

61
00:40:46,0 --> 00:40:46,0
my word? Know ye not that the

62
00:40:46,0 --> 00:40:46,0
testimony of two nations is a

63
00:40:46,0 --> 00:40:46,0
witness unto you that I am

64
00:40:46,0 --> 00:40:46,0
God, that I remember one nation

65
00:40:46,0 --> 00:40:46,0
like unto another? Wherefore,

66
00:40:46,0 --> 00:40:46,0
I speak the same words unto

67
00:40:46,0 --> 00:40:46,0
one nation like unto another.

68
00:40:46,0 --> 00:40:46,0
And when the two nations shall

69
00:40:46,0 --> 00:40:46,0
run together the testimony of

70
00:40:46,0 --> 00:40:18,
the two nations shall run together also.

71
00:40:18,0 --> 00:40:18,0
9 And I do this that I may

72
00:40:18,0 --> 00:40:18,0
prove unto many that I am the

73
00:40:18,0 --> 00:40:18,0
same yesterday, today, and

74
00:40:18,0 --> 00:40:18,0
forever; and that I speak

75
00:40:18,0 --> 00:40:18,0
forth my words according to

76
00:40:18,0 --> 00:40:18,0
mine own pleasure. And because

77
00:40:18,0 --> 00:40:18,0
that I have spoken one word

78
00:40:18,0 --> 00:40:18,0
ye need not suppose that I

79
00:40:18,0 --> 00:40:18,0
cannot speak another; for my

80
00:40:18,0 --> 00:40:18,0
work is not yet finished;

81
00:40:18,0 --> 00:40:18,0
neither shall it be until the

82
00:40:18,0 --> 00:40:18,0
end of man, neither from

83
00:40:18,0 --> 00:43:49,
that time henceforth and forever.

84
00:43:49,0 --> 00:43:49,0
10 Wherefore, because that

85
00:43:49,0 --> 00:43:49,0
ye have a Bible ye need

86
00:43:49,0 --> 00:43:49,0
not suppose that it

87
00:43:49,0 --> 00:43:49,0
contains all my words; neither

88
00:43:49,0 --> 00:43:49,0
need ye suppose that I have

89
00:43:49,0 --> 00:49:32,
not caused more to be written.

90
00:49:32,0 --> 00:49:32,0
11 For I command all

91
00:49:32,0 --> 00:49:32,0
men, both in the east and

92
00:49:32,0 --> 00:49:32,0
in the west, and in the

93
00:49:32,0 --> 00:49:32,0
north, and in the south,

94
00:49:32,0 --> 00:49:32,0
and in the islands of

95
00:49:32,0 --> 00:49:32,0
the sea, that they shall

96
00:49:32,0 --> 00:49:32,0
write the words which I

97
00:49:32,0 --> 00:49:32,0
speak unto them; for out

98
00:49:32,0 --> 00:49:32,0
of the books which shall

99
00:49:32,0 --> 00:49:32,0
be written I will judge

100
00:49:32,0 --> 00:49:32,0
the world, every man

101
00:49:32,0 --> 00:49:32,0
according to their works,

102
00:49:32,0 --> 00:55:28,
according to that which is written.

103
00:55:28,0 --> 00:55:28,0
12 For behold, I shall

104
00:55:28,0 --> 00:55:28,0
speak unto the Jews and

105
00:55:28,0 --> 00:55:28,0
they shall write it;

106
00:55:28,0 --> 00:55:28,0
and I shall also speak

107
00:55:28,0 --> 00:55:28,0
unto the Nephites and

108
00:55:28,0 --> 00:55:28,0
they shall write it; and

109
00:55:28,0 --> 00:55:28,0
I shall also speak unto

110
00:55:28,0 --> 00:55:28,0
the other tribes of

111
00:55:28,0 --> 00:55:28,0
the house of Israel,

112
00:55:28,0 --> 00:55:28,0
which I have led away, and

113
00:55:28,0 --> 00:55:28,0
they shall write it;

114
00:55:28,0 --> 00:55:28,0
and I shall also speak

115
00:55:28,0 --> 00:55:28,0
unto all nations of the

116
00:55:28,0 --> 00:57:40,
earth and they shall write it.

117
00:57:40,0 --> 00:57:40,0
13 And it shall come

118
00:57:40,0 --> 00:57:40,0
to pass that the Jews

119
00:57:40,0 --> 00:57:40,0
shall have the words of

120
00:57:40,0 --> 00:57:40,0
the Nephites, and the

121
00:57:40,0 --> 00:57:40,0
Nephites shall have

122
00:57:40,0 --> 00:57:40,0
the words of the Jews;

123
00:57:40,0 --> 00:57:40,0
and the Nephites and

124
00:57:40,0 --> 00:57:40,0
the Jews shall have the

125
00:57:40,0 --> 00:57:40,0
words of the lost

126
00:57:40,0 --> 00:57:40,0
tribes of Israel; and the

127
00:57:40,0 --> 00:57:40,0
lost tribes of Israel

128
00:57:40,0 --> 00:57:40,0
shall have the words

129
00:57:40,0 --> 01:01:38,
of the Nephites and the Jews.

130
01:01:38,0 --> 01:01:38,0
14 And it shall come

131
01:01:38,0 --> 01:01:38,0
to pass that my

132
01:01:38,0 --> 01:01:38,0
people, which are of the

133
01:01:38,0 --> 01:01:38,0
house of Israel, shall

134
01:01:38,0 --> 01:01:38,0
be gathered home

135
01:01:38,0 --> 01:01:38,0
unto the lands of their

136
01:01:38,0 --> 01:01:38,0
possessions; and my

137
01:01:38,0 --> 01:01:38,0
word also shall be

138
01:01:38,0 --> 01:01:38,0
gathered in one. And I

139
01:01:38,0 --> 01:01:38,0
will show unto them

140
01:01:38,0 --> 01:01:38,0
that fight against my

141
01:01:38,0 --> 01:01:38,0
word and against my

142
01:01:38,0 --> 01:01:38,0
people, who are of the

143
01:01:38,0 --> 01:01:38,0
house of Israel, that

144
01:01:38,0 --> 01:01:38,0
I am God, and that I

145
01:01:38,0 --> 01:01:38,0
covenanted with

146
01:01:38,0 --> 01:01:38,0
Abraham that I would

147
01:01:38,0 --> 01:09:22,
remember his seed forever.
