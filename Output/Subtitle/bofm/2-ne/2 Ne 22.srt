Chapter 22 In the millennial day all men

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
will praise the Lord—He will dwell among

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:10:39,
them—Compare 
Isaiah 12. About 559–545 B.C. 

4
00:10:39,0 --> 00:10:39,0
1 And in that day thou shalt say: O

5
00:10:39,0 --> 00:10:39,0
Lord, I will praise thee; though

6
00:10:39,0 --> 00:10:39,0
thou wast angry with me thine anger is

7
00:10:39,0 --> 00:10:11,
turned away, and thou comfortedst me.

8
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
2 Behold, God is my

9
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
salvation; I will trust, and not be

10
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
afraid; for the Lord Jehovah is

11
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
my strength and my song; he

12
00:10:11,0 --> 00:09:57,
also has become my salvation.

13
00:09:57,0 --> 00:09:57,0
3 Therefore, with joy

14
00:09:57,0 --> 00:09:57,0
shall ye draw water out of

15
00:09:57,0 --> 00:13:28,
the wells of salvation.

16
00:13:28,0 --> 00:13:28,0
4 And in that day shall

17
00:13:28,0 --> 00:13:28,0
ye say: Praise the Lord,

18
00:13:28,0 --> 00:13:28,0
call upon his name,

19
00:13:28,0 --> 00:13:28,0
declare his doings among

20
00:13:28,0 --> 00:13:28,0
the people, make mention

21
00:13:28,0 --> 00:17:41,
that his name is exalted.

22
00:17:41,0 --> 00:17:41,0
5 Sing unto the Lord;

23
00:17:41,0 --> 00:17:41,0
for he hath done

24
00:17:41,0 --> 00:17:41,0
excellent things; this is

25
00:17:41,0 --> 00:17:13,
known in all the earth.

26
00:17:13,0 --> 00:17:13,0
6 Cry out and shout,

27
00:17:13,0 --> 00:17:13,0
thou inhabitant of

28
00:17:13,0 --> 00:17:13,0
Zion; for great is

29
00:17:13,0 --> 00:17:13,0
the Holy One of

30
00:17:13,0 --> 00:16:45,
Israel in the midst of thee.
