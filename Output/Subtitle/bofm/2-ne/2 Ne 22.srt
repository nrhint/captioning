00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:09,333
Chapter 22 In the millennial day all men

2
00:00:09,333 --> 00:00:18,666
will praise the Lord—He will dwell among

3
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:28,829
them—Compare 
Isaiah 12. About 559–545 B.C. 

4
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:30,579
1 And in that day thou shalt say: O

5
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:32,329
Lord, I will praise thee; though

6
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:34,079
thou wast angry with me thine anger is

7
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,869
turned away, and thou comfortedst me.

8
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:35,669
2 Behold, God is my

9
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:35,469
salvation; I will trust, and not be

10
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,269
afraid; for the Lord Jehovah is

11
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:35,069
my strength and my song; he

12
00:00:35,069 --> 00:00:34,935
also has become my salvation.

13
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:34,935
3 Therefore, with joy

14
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:34,935
shall ye draw water out of

15
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:34,001
the wells of salvation.

16
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:33,834
4 And in that day shall

17
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:33,667
ye say: Praise the Lord,

18
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:33,5
call upon his name,

19
00:00:33,5 --> 00:00:33,333
declare his doings among

20
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:33,166
the people, make mention

21
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:33,066
that his name is exalted.

22
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:32,816
5 Sing unto the Lord;

23
00:00:32,816 --> 00:00:32,566
for he hath done

24
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:32,316
excellent things; this is

25
00:00:32,316 --> 00:00:32,599
known in all the earth.

26
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:32,599
6 Cry out and shout,

27
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:32,599
thou inhabitant of

28
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:32,599
Zion; for great is

29
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:32,599
the Holy One of

30
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:32,599
Israel in the midst of thee.
