Chapter 5 The Nephites separate themselves

2
00:00:03,5 --> 00:00:07,0
from the Lamanites, keep the law of Moses,

3
00:00:07,0 --> 00:00:10,5
and build a temple—Because of their

4
00:00:10,5 --> 00:00:14,0
unbelief, the Lamanites are cut off from the

5
00:00:14,0 --> 00:00:17,5
presence of the Lord, are cursed, and become a

6
00:00:17,5 --> 00:00:21,321
scourge unto the Nephites. About 588–559 B.C. 

7
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:25,654
1 Behold, it came to pass that I,

8
00:00:25,654 --> 00:00:29,987
Nephi, did cry much unto the Lord my

9
00:00:29,987 --> 00:00:34,668
God, because of the anger of my brethren.

10
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:40,668
2 But behold, their anger did

11
00:00:40,668 --> 00:00:46,668
increase against me, insomuch that

12
00:00:46,668 --> 00:00:52,553
they did seek to take away my life.

13
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:53,37
3 Yea, they did murmur against

14
00:00:53,37 --> 00:00:54,189
me, saying: Our younger brother

15
00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:55,007
thinks to rule over us; and we

16
00:00:55,007 --> 00:00:55,825
have had much trial because of

17
00:00:55,825 --> 00:00:56,642
him; wherefore, now let us

18
00:00:56,642 --> 00:00:57,461
slay him, that we may not be

19
00:00:57,461 --> 00:00:58,279
afflicted more because of his words.

20
00:00:58,279 --> 00:00:59,096
For behold, we will not have

21
00:00:59,096 --> 00:00:59,915
him to be our ruler; for it

22
00:00:59,915 --> 00:01:00,733
belongs unto us, who are the elder

23
00:01:00,733 --> 00:01:01,528
brethren, to rule over this people.

24
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:03,128
4 Now I do not write upon

25
00:01:03,128 --> 00:01:04,728
these plates all the words which

26
00:01:04,728 --> 00:01:06,328
they murmured against me. But

27
00:01:06,328 --> 00:01:07,928
it sufficeth me to say, that

28
00:01:07,928 --> 00:01:09,97
they did seek to take away my life.

29
00:01:09,97 --> 00:01:11,637
5 And it came to pass

30
00:01:11,637 --> 00:01:13,304
that the Lord did warn me,

31
00:01:13,304 --> 00:01:14,971
that I, Nephi, should

32
00:01:14,971 --> 00:01:16,638
depart from them and flee

33
00:01:16,638 --> 00:01:18,305
into the wilderness, and all

34
00:01:18,305 --> 00:01:19,413
those who would go with me.

35
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:19,351
6 Wherefore, it came to

36
00:01:19,351 --> 00:01:19,289
pass that I, Nephi, did

37
00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:19,227
take my family, and also

38
00:01:19,227 --> 00:01:19,165
Zoram and his family,

39
00:01:19,165 --> 00:01:19,103
and Sam, mine elder

40
00:01:19,103 --> 00:01:19,041
brother and his family, and

41
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:18,979
Jacob and Joseph, my

42
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:18,917
younger brethren, and also

43
00:01:18,917 --> 00:01:18,855
my sisters, and all those

44
00:01:18,855 --> 00:01:18,793
who would go with me.

45
00:01:18,793 --> 00:01:18,731
And all those who would

46
00:01:18,731 --> 00:01:18,669
go with me were those who

47
00:01:18,669 --> 00:01:18,607
believed in the

48
00:01:18,607 --> 00:01:18,545
warnings and the revelations of

49
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:18,483
God; wherefore, they

50
00:01:18,483 --> 00:01:18,478
did hearken unto my words.

51
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:18,589
7 And we did take our

52
00:01:18,589 --> 00:01:18,7
tents and whatsoever

53
00:01:18,7 --> 00:01:18,811
things were possible for

54
00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:18,922
us, and did journey in

55
00:01:18,922 --> 00:01:19,033
the wilderness for the

56
00:01:19,033 --> 00:01:19,144
space of many days. And

57
00:01:19,144 --> 00:01:19,255
after we had journeyed

58
00:01:19,255 --> 00:01:19,366
for the space of many

59
00:01:19,366 --> 00:01:19,479
days we did pitch our tents.

60
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:19,279
8 And my people

61
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:19,079
would that we should

62
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:18,879
call the name of the

63
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:18,679
place Nephi;

64
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:18,545
wherefore, we did call it Nephi.

65
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:18,945
9 And all those

66
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:19,345
who were with me did

67
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:19,745
take upon them to

68
00:01:19,745 --> 00:01:20,145
call themselves

69
00:01:20,145 --> 00:01:20,948
the people of Nephi.

70
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:24,573
10 And we did

71
00:01:24,573 --> 00:01:28,198
observe to keep the

72
00:01:28,198 --> 00:01:31,823
judgments, and

73
00:01:31,823 --> 00:01:35,448
the statutes, and

74
00:01:35,448 --> 00:01:39,073
the commandments

75
00:01:39,073 --> 00:01:42,698
of the Lord in all

76
00:01:42,698 --> 00:01:46,323
things,

77
00:01:46,323 --> 00:01:49,81
according to the law of Moses.

78
00:01:49,81 --> 00:01:50,083
11 And the Lord

79
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:50,356
was with us; and

80
00:01:50,356 --> 00:01:50,629
we did prosper

81
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:50,902
exceedingly; for

82
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:51,175
we did sow

83
00:01:51,175 --> 00:01:51,448
seed, and we did

84
00:01:51,448 --> 00:01:51,721
reap again in

85
00:01:51,721 --> 00:01:51,994
abundance. And we

86
00:01:51,994 --> 00:01:52,267
began to raise

87
00:01:52,267 --> 00:01:52,54
flocks, and herds,

88
00:01:52,54 --> 00:01:52,212
and animals of every kind.

89
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:53,141
12 And I,

90
00:01:53,141 --> 00:01:54,07
Nephi, had also

91
00:01:54,07 --> 00:01:54,999
brought the records

92
00:01:54,999 --> 00:01:55,928
which were

93
00:01:55,928 --> 00:01:56,857
engraven upon the

94
00:01:56,857 --> 00:01:57,786
plates of

95
00:01:57,786 --> 00:01:58,715
brass; and also the

96
00:01:58,715 --> 00:01:59,644
ball, or

97
00:01:59,644 --> 00:02:00,573
compass, which was

98
00:02:00,573 --> 00:02:01,502
prepared for my

99
00:02:01,502 --> 00:02:02,431
father by the

100
00:02:02,431 --> 00:02:03,36
hand of the Lord,

101
00:02:03,36 --> 00:02:04,289
according to

102
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:05,592
that which is written.

103
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:06,925
13 And it came

104
00:02:06,925 --> 00:02:08,258
to pass that

105
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:09,591
we began to

106
00:02:09,591 --> 00:02:10,924
prosper

107
00:02:10,924 --> 00:02:12,257
exceedingly, and to

108
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,567
multiply in the land.

109
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:14,567
14 And I,

110
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:15,567
Nephi, did take

111
00:02:15,567 --> 00:02:16,567
the sword of

112
00:02:16,567 --> 00:02:17,567
Laban, and

113
00:02:17,567 --> 00:02:18,567
after the

114
00:02:18,567 --> 00:02:19,567
manner of it did

115
00:02:19,567 --> 00:02:20,567
make many

116
00:02:20,567 --> 00:02:21,567
swords, lest by

117
00:02:21,567 --> 00:02:22,567
any means the

118
00:02:22,567 --> 00:02:23,567
people who

119
00:02:23,567 --> 00:02:24,567
were now called

120
00:02:24,567 --> 00:02:25,567
Lamanites

121
00:02:25,567 --> 00:02:26,567
should come

122
00:02:26,567 --> 00:02:27,567
upon us and

123
00:02:27,567 --> 00:02:28,567
destroy us; for I

124
00:02:28,567 --> 00:02:29,567
knew their

125
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:30,567
hatred towards

126
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:31,567
me and my

127
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:32,567
children and

128
00:02:32,567 --> 00:02:33,92
those who were called my people.

129
00:02:33,92 --> 00:02:35,332
15 And I did

130
00:02:35,332 --> 00:02:36,744
teach my

131
00:02:36,744 --> 00:02:38,156
people to

132
00:02:38,156 --> 00:02:39,568
build buildings,

133
00:02:39,568 --> 00:02:40,98
and to work

134
00:02:40,98 --> 00:02:42,392
in all

135
00:02:42,392 --> 00:02:43,804
manner of wood,

136
00:02:43,804 --> 00:02:45,216
and of iron,

137
00:02:45,216 --> 00:02:46,628
and of

138
00:02:46,628 --> 00:02:48,04
copper, and of

139
00:02:48,04 --> 00:02:49,452
brass, and of

140
00:02:49,452 --> 00:02:50,864
steel, and

141
00:02:50,864 --> 00:02:52,276
of gold, and

142
00:02:52,276 --> 00:02:53,688
of silver,

143
00:02:53,688 --> 00:02:55,1
and of

144
00:02:55,1 --> 00:02:56,512
precious ores,

145
00:02:56,512 --> 00:02:57,844
which were in great abundance.

146
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:58,5
16 And I,

147
00:02:58,5 --> 00:02:59,156
Nephi, did

148
00:02:59,156 --> 00:02:59,812
build a

149
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:00,468
temple; and I

150
00:03:00,468 --> 00:03:01,124
did

151
00:03:01,124 --> 00:03:01,78
construct it after

152
00:03:01,78 --> 00:03:02,436
the manner

153
00:03:02,436 --> 00:03:03,092
of the

154
00:03:03,092 --> 00:03:03,748
temple of

155
00:03:03,748 --> 00:03:04,404
Solomon save it

156
00:03:04,404 --> 00:03:05,06
were not

157
00:03:05,06 --> 00:03:05,716
built of so

158
00:03:05,716 --> 00:03:06,372
many

159
00:03:06,372 --> 00:03:07,028
precious things;

160
00:03:07,028 --> 00:03:07,684
for they

161
00:03:07,684 --> 00:03:08,34
were not to be

162
00:03:08,34 --> 00:03:08,996
found upon

163
00:03:08,996 --> 00:03:09,652
the land,

164
00:03:09,652 --> 00:03:10,308
wherefore,

165
00:03:10,308 --> 00:03:10,964
it could

166
00:03:10,964 --> 00:03:11,62
not be built

167
00:03:11,62 --> 00:03:12,276
like unto

168
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:12,932
Solomon’s

169
00:03:12,932 --> 00:03:13,588
temple. But

170
00:03:13,588 --> 00:03:14,244
the manner

171
00:03:14,244 --> 00:03:14,9
of the

172
00:03:14,9 --> 00:03:15,556
construction was

173
00:03:15,556 --> 00:03:16,212
like unto

174
00:03:16,212 --> 00:03:16,868
the temple

175
00:03:16,868 --> 00:03:17,524
of Solomon;

176
00:03:17,524 --> 00:03:18,18
and the

177
00:03:18,18 --> 00:03:18,165
workmanship thereof was exceedingly fine.

178
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:19,865
17 And it

179
00:03:19,865 --> 00:03:21,565
came to

180
00:03:21,565 --> 00:03:23,265
pass that I,

181
00:03:23,265 --> 00:03:24,965
Nephi,

182
00:03:24,965 --> 00:03:26,665
did cause my

183
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,365
people to

184
00:03:28,365 --> 00:03:30,065
be

185
00:03:30,065 --> 00:03:31,765
industrious, and

186
00:03:31,765 --> 00:03:33,465
to labor

187
00:03:33,465 --> 00:03:35,115
with their hands.

188
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:35,715
18 And it

189
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:36,315
came to

190
00:03:36,315 --> 00:03:36,915
pass that

191
00:03:36,915 --> 00:03:37,515
they

192
00:03:37,515 --> 00:03:38,115
would that I

193
00:03:38,115 --> 00:03:38,715
should

194
00:03:38,715 --> 00:03:39,315
be their

195
00:03:39,315 --> 00:03:39,915
king. But

196
00:03:39,915 --> 00:03:40,515
I, Nephi,

197
00:03:40,515 --> 00:03:41,115
was

198
00:03:41,115 --> 00:03:41,715
desirous that

199
00:03:41,715 --> 00:03:42,315
they

200
00:03:42,315 --> 00:03:42,915
should have

201
00:03:42,915 --> 00:03:43,515
no king;

202
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:44,115


203
00:03:44,115 --> 00:03:44,715
nevertheless, I

204
00:03:44,715 --> 00:03:45,315
did for

205
00:03:45,315 --> 00:03:45,915
them

206
00:03:45,915 --> 00:03:46,515
according to

207
00:03:46,515 --> 00:03:47,994
that which was in my power.

208
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:47,994
19 And

209
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:47,994
behold,

210
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:47,994
the words

211
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:47,994
of the

212
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:47,994
Lord had

213
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:47,994
been

214
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:47,994
fulfilled

215
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:47,994
unto my

216
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:47,994


217
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:47,994
brethren, which

218
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:47,994
he spake

219
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:47,994


220
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:47,994
concerning

221
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:47,994
them, that I

222
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:47,994
should

223
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:47,994
be their

224
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:47,994
ruler

225
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:47,994
and their

226
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:47,994


227
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:47,994
teacher.

228
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:47,994
Wherefore, I

229
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:47,994
had been

230
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:47,994
their

231
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:47,994
ruler and

232
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:47,994
their

233
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:47,994
teacher,

234
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:47,994
according

235
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:47,994
to the

236
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:47,994


237
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:47,994
commandments of

238
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:47,994
the

239
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:47,994
Lord, until

240
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:47,994
the time

241
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:47,06
they sought to take away my life.

242
00:03:47,06 --> 00:03:47,027
20

243
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:46,994
Wherefore,

244
00:03:46,994 --> 00:03:46,961
the

245
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:46,928
word of

246
00:03:46,928 --> 00:03:46,895
the Lord

247
00:03:46,895 --> 00:03:46,862
was

248
00:03:46,862 --> 00:03:46,829
fulfilled

249
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:46,796
which

250
00:03:46,796 --> 00:03:46,763
he spake

251
00:03:46,763 --> 00:03:46,73
unto

252
00:03:46,73 --> 00:03:46,697
me,

253
00:03:46,697 --> 00:03:46,664
saying

254
00:03:46,664 --> 00:03:46,631
that:

255
00:03:46,631 --> 00:03:46,598
Inasmuch as

256
00:03:46,598 --> 00:03:46,565
they

257
00:03:46,565 --> 00:03:46,532
will not

258
00:03:46,532 --> 00:03:46,499
hearken

259
00:03:46,499 --> 00:03:46,466
unto

260
00:03:46,466 --> 00:03:46,433
thy

261
00:03:46,433 --> 00:03:46,4
words they

262
00:03:46,4 --> 00:03:46,367
shall

263
00:03:46,367 --> 00:03:46,334
be cut

264
00:03:46,334 --> 00:03:46,301
off from

265
00:03:46,301 --> 00:03:46,268
the

266
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:46,235
presence

267
00:03:46,235 --> 00:03:46,202
of the

268
00:03:46,202 --> 00:03:46,169
Lord.

269
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:46,136
And

270
00:03:46,136 --> 00:03:46,103
behold,

271
00:03:46,103 --> 00:03:46,593
they were cut off from his presence.

272
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:46,63
21 And

273
00:03:46,63 --> 00:03:46,667
he had

274
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:46,704
caused

275
00:03:46,704 --> 00:03:46,741
the

276
00:03:46,741 --> 00:03:46,778
cursing to

277
00:03:46,778 --> 00:03:46,815
come

278
00:03:46,815 --> 00:03:46,852
upon

279
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:46,889
them, yea,

280
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:46,926
even a

281
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:46,963
sore

282
00:03:46,963 --> 00:03:47,0
cursing,

283
00:03:47,0 --> 00:03:47,037


284
00:03:47,037 --> 00:03:47,074
because of

285
00:03:47,074 --> 00:03:47,111
their

286
00:03:47,111 --> 00:03:47,148
iniquity.

287
00:03:47,148 --> 00:03:47,185
For

288
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:47,222
behold,

289
00:03:47,222 --> 00:03:47,259
they had

290
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:47,296


291
00:03:47,296 --> 00:03:47,333
hardened their

292
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:47,37
hearts

293
00:03:47,37 --> 00:03:47,407


294
00:03:47,407 --> 00:03:47,444
against him,

295
00:03:47,444 --> 00:03:47,481
that

296
00:03:47,481 --> 00:03:47,518
they had

297
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:47,555
become

298
00:03:47,555 --> 00:03:47,592
like

299
00:03:47,592 --> 00:03:47,629

300
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:47,666
flint;

301
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:47,703


302
00:03:47,703 --> 00:03:47,74
wherefore, as

303
00:03:47,74 --> 00:03:47,777
they were

304
00:03:47,777 --> 00:03:47,814
white,

305
00:03:47,814 --> 00:03:47,851
and

306
00:03:47,851 --> 00:03:47,888


307
00:03:47,888 --> 00:03:47,925
exceedingly fair

308
00:03:47,925 --> 00:03:47,962
and

309
00:03:47,962 --> 00:03:47,999


310
00:03:47,999 --> 00:03:48,036
delightsome,

311
00:03:48,036 --> 00:03:48,073
that they

312
00:03:48,073 --> 00:03:48,11
might

313
00:03:48,11 --> 00:03:48,147
not be

314
00:03:48,147 --> 00:03:48,184
enticing

315
00:03:48,184 --> 00:03:48,221
unto

316
00:03:48,221 --> 00:03:48,258
my

317
00:03:48,258 --> 00:03:48,295
people the

318
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:48,332
Lord God

319
00:03:48,332 --> 00:03:48,369
did

320
00:03:48,369 --> 00:03:48,406
cause a

321
00:03:48,406 --> 00:03:48,443
skin of

322
00:03:48,443 --> 00:03:48,48


323
00:03:48,48 --> 00:03:48,517
blackness to

324
00:03:48,517 --> 00:03:48,554
come

325
00:03:48,554 --> 00:03:48,995
upon them.

326
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:49,295
22 And

327
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:49,595
thus

328
00:03:49,595 --> 00:03:49,895
saith

329
00:03:49,895 --> 00:03:50,195
the

330
00:03:50,195 --> 00:03:50,495
Lord

331
00:03:50,495 --> 00:03:50,795
God: I

332
00:03:50,795 --> 00:03:51,095
will

333
00:03:51,095 --> 00:03:51,395
cause

334
00:03:51,395 --> 00:03:51,695
that they

335
00:03:51,695 --> 00:03:51,995
shall

336
00:03:51,995 --> 00:03:52,295
be

337
00:03:52,295 --> 00:03:52,595


338
00:03:52,595 --> 00:03:52,895
loathsome unto

339
00:03:52,895 --> 00:03:53,195
thy

340
00:03:53,195 --> 00:03:53,495
people,

343
00:03:54,095 --> 00:03:54,395
shall

344
00:03:54,395 --> 00:03:54,695
repent

345
00:03:54,695 --> 00:03:54,401
of their iniquities.

346
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,253
23

347
00:03:55,253 --> 00:03:56,105
And

348
00:03:56,105 --> 00:03:56,957

364
00:04:09,737 --> 00:04:10,589
cursed

374
00:04:17,36 --> 00:04:17,33
