Chapter 5 The Nephites separate themselves

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
from the Lamanites, keep the law of Moses,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and build a temple—Because of their

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
unbelief, the Lamanites are cut off from the

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
presence of the Lord, are cursed, and become a

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:03:31,
scourge unto the Nephites. About 588–559 B.C. 

7
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
1 Behold, it came to pass that I,

8
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
Nephi, did cry much unto the Lord my

9
00:03:31,0 --> 00:26:07,
God, because of the anger of my brethren.

10
00:26:07,0 --> 00:26:07,0
2 But behold, their anger did

11
00:26:07,0 --> 00:26:07,0
increase against me, insomuch that

12
00:26:07,0 --> 00:29:38,
they did seek to take away my life.

13
00:29:38,0 --> 00:29:38,0
3 Yea, they did murmur against

14
00:29:38,0 --> 00:29:38,0
me, saying: Our younger brother

15
00:29:38,0 --> 00:29:38,0
thinks to rule over us; and we

16
00:29:38,0 --> 00:29:38,0
have had much trial because of

17
00:29:38,0 --> 00:29:38,0
him; wherefore, now let us

18
00:29:38,0 --> 00:29:38,0
slay him, that we may not be

19
00:29:38,0 --> 00:29:38,0
afflicted more because of his words.

20
00:29:38,0 --> 00:29:38,0
For behold, we will not have

21
00:29:38,0 --> 00:29:38,0
him to be our ruler; for it

22
00:29:38,0 --> 00:29:38,0
belongs unto us, who are the elder

23
00:29:38,0 --> 00:29:10,
brethren, to rule over this people.

24
00:29:10,0 --> 00:29:10,0
4 Now I do not write upon

25
00:29:10,0 --> 00:29:10,0
these plates all the words which

26
00:29:10,0 --> 00:29:10,0
they murmured against me. But

27
00:29:10,0 --> 00:29:10,0
it sufficeth me to say, that

28
00:29:10,0 --> 00:29:40,
they did seek to take away my life.

29
00:29:40,0 --> 00:29:40,0
5 And it came to pass

30
00:29:40,0 --> 00:29:40,0
that the Lord did warn me,

31
00:29:40,0 --> 00:29:40,0
that I, Nephi, should

32
00:29:40,0 --> 00:29:40,0
depart from them and flee

33
00:29:40,0 --> 00:29:40,0
into the wilderness, and all

34
00:29:40,0 --> 00:30:52,
those who would go with me.

35
00:30:52,0 --> 00:30:52,0
6 Wherefore, it came to

36
00:30:52,0 --> 00:30:52,0
pass that I, Nephi, did

37
00:30:52,0 --> 00:30:52,0
take my family, and also

38
00:30:52,0 --> 00:30:52,0
Zoram and his family,

39
00:30:52,0 --> 00:30:52,0
and Sam, mine elder

40
00:30:52,0 --> 00:30:52,0
brother and his family, and

41
00:30:52,0 --> 00:30:52,0
Jacob and Joseph, my

42
00:30:52,0 --> 00:30:52,0
younger brethren, and also

43
00:30:52,0 --> 00:30:52,0
my sisters, and all those

44
00:30:52,0 --> 00:30:52,0
who would go with me.

45
00:30:52,0 --> 00:30:52,0
And all those who would

46
00:30:52,0 --> 00:30:52,0
go with me were those who

47
00:30:52,0 --> 00:30:52,0
believed in the

48
00:30:52,0 --> 00:30:52,0
warnings and the revelations of

49
00:30:52,0 --> 00:30:52,0
God; wherefore, they

50
00:30:52,0 --> 00:34:51,
did hearken unto my words.

51
00:34:51,0 --> 00:34:51,0
7 And we did take our

52
00:34:51,0 --> 00:34:51,0
tents and whatsoever

53
00:34:51,0 --> 00:34:51,0
things were possible for

54
00:34:51,0 --> 00:34:51,0
us, and did journey in

55
00:34:51,0 --> 00:34:51,0
the wilderness for the

56
00:34:51,0 --> 00:34:51,0
space of many days. And

57
00:34:51,0 --> 00:34:51,0
after we had journeyed

58
00:34:51,0 --> 00:34:51,0
for the space of many

59
00:34:51,0 --> 00:38:22,
days we did pitch our tents.

60
00:38:22,0 --> 00:38:22,0
8 And my people

61
00:38:22,0 --> 00:38:22,0
would that we should

62
00:38:22,0 --> 00:38:22,0
call the name of the

63
00:38:22,0 --> 00:38:22,0
place Nephi;

64
00:38:22,0 --> 00:38:08,
wherefore, we did call it Nephi.

65
00:38:08,0 --> 00:38:08,0
9 And all those

66
00:38:08,0 --> 00:38:08,0
who were with me did

67
00:38:08,0 --> 00:38:08,0
take upon them to

68
00:38:08,0 --> 00:38:08,0
call themselves

69
00:38:08,0 --> 00:39:20,
the people of Nephi.

70
00:39:20,0 --> 00:39:20,0
10 And we did

71
00:39:20,0 --> 00:39:20,0
observe to keep the

72
00:39:20,0 --> 00:39:20,0
judgments, and

73
00:39:20,0 --> 00:39:20,0
the statutes, and

74
00:39:20,0 --> 00:39:20,0
the commandments

75
00:39:20,0 --> 00:39:20,0
of the Lord in all

76
00:39:20,0 --> 00:39:20,0
things,

77
00:39:20,0 --> 00:41:04,
according to the law of Moses.

78
00:41:04,0 --> 00:41:04,0
11 And the Lord

79
00:41:04,0 --> 00:41:04,0
was with us; and

80
00:41:04,0 --> 00:41:04,0
we did prosper

81
00:41:04,0 --> 00:41:04,0
exceedingly; for

82
00:41:04,0 --> 00:41:04,0
we did sow

83
00:41:04,0 --> 00:41:04,0
seed, and we did

84
00:41:04,0 --> 00:41:04,0
reap again in

85
00:41:04,0 --> 00:41:04,0
abundance. And we

86
00:41:04,0 --> 00:41:04,0
began to raise

87
00:41:04,0 --> 00:41:04,0
flocks, and herds,

88
00:41:04,0 --> 00:45:03,
and animals of every kind.

89
00:45:03,0 --> 00:45:03,0
12 And I,

90
00:45:03,0 --> 00:45:03,0
Nephi, had also

91
00:45:03,0 --> 00:45:03,0
brought the records

92
00:45:03,0 --> 00:45:03,0
which were

93
00:45:03,0 --> 00:45:03,0
engraven upon the

94
00:45:03,0 --> 00:45:03,0
plates of

95
00:45:03,0 --> 00:45:03,0
brass; and also the

96
00:45:03,0 --> 00:45:03,0
ball, or

97
00:45:03,0 --> 00:45:03,0
compass, which was

98
00:45:03,0 --> 00:45:03,0
prepared for my

99
00:45:03,0 --> 00:45:03,0
father by the

100
00:45:03,0 --> 00:45:03,0
hand of the Lord,

101
00:45:03,0 --> 00:45:03,0
according to

102
00:45:03,0 --> 00:52:32,
that which is written.

103
00:52:32,0 --> 00:52:32,0
13 And it came

104
00:52:32,0 --> 00:52:32,0
to pass that

105
00:52:32,0 --> 00:52:32,0
we began to

106
00:52:32,0 --> 00:52:32,0
prosper

107
00:52:32,0 --> 00:52:32,0
exceedingly, and to

108
00:52:32,0 --> 00:54:16,
multiply in the land.

109
00:54:16,0 --> 00:54:16,0
14 And I,

110
00:54:16,0 --> 00:54:16,0
Nephi, did take

111
00:54:16,0 --> 00:54:16,0
the sword of

112
00:54:16,0 --> 00:54:16,0
Laban, and

113
00:54:16,0 --> 00:54:16,0
after the

114
00:54:16,0 --> 00:54:16,0
manner of it did

115
00:54:16,0 --> 00:54:16,0
make many

116
00:54:16,0 --> 00:54:16,0
swords, lest by

117
00:54:16,0 --> 00:54:16,0
any means the

118
00:54:16,0 --> 00:54:16,0
people who

119
00:54:16,0 --> 00:54:16,0
were now called

120
00:54:16,0 --> 00:54:16,0
Lamanites

121
00:54:16,0 --> 00:54:16,0
should come

122
00:54:16,0 --> 00:54:16,0
upon us and

123
00:54:16,0 --> 00:54:16,0
destroy us; for I

124
00:54:16,0 --> 00:54:16,0
knew their

125
00:54:16,0 --> 00:54:16,0
hatred towards

126
00:54:16,0 --> 00:54:16,0
me and my

127
00:54:16,0 --> 00:54:16,0
children and

128
00:54:16,0 --> 01:06:27,
those who were called my people.

129
01:06:27,0 --> 01:06:27,0
15 And I did

130
01:06:27,0 --> 01:06:27,0
teach my

131
01:06:27,0 --> 01:06:27,0
people to

132
01:06:27,0 --> 01:06:27,0
build buildings,

133
01:06:27,0 --> 01:06:27,0
and to work

134
01:06:27,0 --> 01:06:27,0
in all

135
01:06:27,0 --> 01:06:27,0
manner of wood,

136
01:06:27,0 --> 01:06:27,0
and of iron,

137
01:06:27,0 --> 01:06:27,0
and of

138
01:06:27,0 --> 01:06:27,0
copper, and of

139
01:06:27,0 --> 01:06:27,0
brass, and of

140
01:06:27,0 --> 01:06:27,0
steel, and

141
01:06:27,0 --> 01:06:27,0
of gold, and

142
01:06:27,0 --> 01:06:27,0
of silver,

143
01:06:27,0 --> 01:06:27,0
and of

144
01:06:27,0 --> 01:06:27,0
precious ores,

145
01:06:27,0 --> 01:15:54,
which were in great abundance.

146
01:15:54,0 --> 01:15:54,0
16 And I,

147
01:15:54,0 --> 01:15:54,0
Nephi, did

148
01:15:54,0 --> 01:15:54,0
build a

149
01:15:54,0 --> 01:15:54,0
temple; and I

150
01:15:54,0 --> 01:15:54,0
did

151
01:15:54,0 --> 01:15:54,0
construct it after

152
01:15:54,0 --> 01:15:54,0
the manner

153
01:15:54,0 --> 01:15:54,0
of the

154
01:15:54,0 --> 01:15:54,0
temple of

155
01:15:54,0 --> 01:15:54,0
Solomon save it

156
01:15:54,0 --> 01:15:54,0
were not

157
01:15:54,0 --> 01:15:54,0
built of so

158
01:15:54,0 --> 01:15:54,0
many

159
01:15:54,0 --> 01:15:54,0
precious things;

160
01:15:54,0 --> 01:15:54,0
for they

161
01:15:54,0 --> 01:15:54,0
were not to be

162
01:15:54,0 --> 01:15:54,0
found upon

163
01:15:54,0 --> 01:15:54,0
the land,

164
01:15:54,0 --> 01:15:54,0
wherefore,

165
01:15:54,0 --> 01:15:54,0
it could

166
01:15:54,0 --> 01:15:54,0
not be built

167
01:15:54,0 --> 01:15:54,0
like unto

168
01:15:54,0 --> 01:15:54,0
Solomon’s

169
01:15:54,0 --> 01:15:54,0
temple. But

170
01:15:54,0 --> 01:15:54,0
the manner

171
01:15:54,0 --> 01:15:54,0
of the

172
01:15:54,0 --> 01:15:54,0
construction was

173
01:15:54,0 --> 01:15:54,0
like unto

174
01:15:54,0 --> 01:15:54,0
the temple

175
01:15:54,0 --> 01:15:54,0
of Solomon;

176
01:15:54,0 --> 01:15:54,0
and the

177
01:15:54,0 --> 01:15:26,
workmanship thereof was exceedingly fine.

178
01:15:26,0 --> 01:15:26,0
17 And it

179
01:15:26,0 --> 01:15:26,0
came to

180
01:15:26,0 --> 01:15:26,0
pass that I,

181
01:15:26,0 --> 01:15:26,0
Nephi,

182
01:15:26,0 --> 01:15:26,0
did cause my

183
01:15:26,0 --> 01:15:26,0
people to

184
01:15:26,0 --> 01:15:26,0
be

185
01:15:26,0 --> 01:15:26,0
industrious, and

186
01:15:26,0 --> 01:15:26,0
to labor

187
01:15:26,0 --> 01:14:58,
with their hands.

188
01:14:58,0 --> 01:14:58,0
18 And it

189
01:14:58,0 --> 01:14:58,0
came to

190
01:14:58,0 --> 01:14:58,0
pass that

191
01:14:58,0 --> 01:14:58,0
they

192
01:14:58,0 --> 01:14:58,0
would that I

193
01:14:58,0 --> 01:14:58,0
should

194
01:14:58,0 --> 01:14:58,0
be their

195
01:14:58,0 --> 01:14:58,0
king. But

196
01:14:58,0 --> 01:14:58,0
I, Nephi,

197
01:14:58,0 --> 01:14:58,0
was

198
01:14:58,0 --> 01:14:58,0
desirous that

199
01:14:58,0 --> 01:14:58,0
they

200
01:14:58,0 --> 01:14:58,0
should have

201
01:14:58,0 --> 01:14:58,0
no king;

202
01:14:58,0 --> 01:14:58,0


203
01:14:58,0 --> 01:14:58,0
nevertheless, I

204
01:14:58,0 --> 01:14:58,0
did for

205
01:14:58,0 --> 01:14:58,0
them

206
01:14:58,0 --> 01:14:58,0
according to

207
01:14:58,0 --> 01:15:42,
that which was in my power.

208
01:15:42,0 --> 01:15:42,0
19 And

209
01:15:42,0 --> 01:15:42,0
behold,

210
01:15:42,0 --> 01:15:42,0
the words

211
01:15:42,0 --> 01:15:42,0
of the

212
01:15:42,0 --> 01:15:42,0
Lord had

213
01:15:42,0 --> 01:15:42,0
been

214
01:15:42,0 --> 01:15:42,0
fulfilled

215
01:15:42,0 --> 01:15:42,0
unto my

216
01:15:42,0 --> 01:15:42,0


217
01:15:42,0 --> 01:15:42,0
brethren, which

218
01:15:42,0 --> 01:15:42,0
he spake

219
01:15:42,0 --> 01:15:42,0


220
01:15:42,0 --> 01:15:42,0
concerning

221
01:15:42,0 --> 01:15:42,0
them, that I

222
01:15:42,0 --> 01:15:42,0
should

223
01:15:42,0 --> 01:15:42,0
be their

224

01:15:42,0 --> 01:15:42,0

228
01:15:42,0 --> 01:15:42,0
Wherefore, I

229
01:15:42,0 --> 01:15:42,0
had been

230
01:15:42,0 --> 01:15:42,0

01:15:42,0 --> 01:15:42,0
the

240
01:15:42,0 --> 01:15:42,0
the time

241
01:15:42,0 --> 01:15:14,
they sought to take away my life.

242
01:15:14,0 --> 01:15:14,0
20

243
01:15:14,0 --> 01:15:14,0
Wherefore,

01:15:14,0 --> 01:15:14,0
the

245
01:15:14,0 --> 01:15:14,0
word of

246
01:15:14,0 --> 01:15:14,0
the Lord

247
01:15:14,0 --> 01:15:14,0
was

248
01:15:14,0 --> 01:15:14,0
fulfilled

01:15:14,0 --> 01:15:14,0
which

250
01:15:14,0 --> 01:15:14,0
he spake

251
01:15:14,0 --> 01:15:14,0
unto

252
01:15:14,0 --> 01:15:14,0
me,

253
01:15:14,0 --> 01:15:14,0
saying

254
01:15:14,0 --> 01:15:14,0
that:

255
01:15:14,0 --> 01:15:14,0
Inasmuch as

256
01:15:14,0 --> 01:15:14,0
they

257
01:15:14,0 --> 01:15:14,0
will not

259
01:15:14,0 --> 01:15:14,0
unto

260
01:15:14,0 --> 01:15:14,0
thy

261
01:15:14,0 --> 01:15:14,0
words they

262
01:15:14,0 --> 01:15:14,0
shall

263
01:15:14,0 --> 01:15:14,0
be cut

264
01:15:14,0 --> 01:15:14,0
off from

265
01:15:14,0 --> 01:15:14,0
the

266
01:15:14,0 --> 01:15:14,0
presence

267
01:15:14,0 --> 01:15:14,0
of the

268
01:15:14,0 --> 01:15:14,0
Lord.

269
01:15:14,0 --> 01:15:14,0
And

270
01:15:14,0 --> 01:15:14,0
behold,

271
01:15:14,0 --> 01:15:58,
they were cut off from his presence.

272
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0
21 And

273
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0
he had

274
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0
caused

275
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0
the

276
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0
cursing to

01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0
them, yea,

280
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0
even a

281
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0
sore

282
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0
cursing,

283
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0


284
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0
because of

285
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0
their

286
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0
iniquity.

287
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0
For

288
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0
behold,

289
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0
they had

290
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0


291
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0
hardened their

292
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0
hearts

293
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0


294
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0
against him,

295
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0
that

296
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0
they had

297
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0
become

298
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0

301
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0


302
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0
wherefore, as

303
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0
they were

304
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0

305
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0

01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0
exceedingly fair

01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0


310
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0
delightsome,

311
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0
that they

312
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0
might

313
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0
not be

314
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0

315
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0
unto

316
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0
my

317
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0
people the

318
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0
Lord God

319
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0
did

320
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0
cause a

321
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0

325
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:30,
upon them.

326
01:15:30,0 --> 01:15:30,0
22 And

327
01:15:30,0 --> 01:15:30,0
thus

328
01:15:30,0 --> 01:15:30,0
saith

329
01:15:30,0 --> 01:15:30,0
the

330
01:15:30,0 --> 01:15:30,0
Lord

331
01:15:30,0 --> 01:15:30,0
God: I

332
01:15:30,0 --> 01:15:30,0
will

333
01:15:30,0 --> 01:15:30,0
cause

337
01:15:30,0 --> 01:15:30,0


338
01:15:30,0 --> 01:15:30,0
loathsome unto

339
01:15:30,0 --> 01:15:30,0
thy

340
01:15:30,0 --> 01:15:30,0

01:15:30,0 --> 01:15:30,0
repent

345
01:15:30,0 --> 01:15:02,
of their iniquities.

346
01:15:02,0 --> 01:15:02,0
23

347
01:15:02,0 --> 01:15:02,0
And
