00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:11,833
Chapter 5 The Nephites separate themselves from

2
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:23,666
 the Lamanites, keep the law of Moses, and build a

3
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:35,499
 temple—Because of their unbelief, the Lamanites are

4
00:00:35,499 --> 00:00:47,332
 cut off from the presence of the Lord, are cursed,

5
00:00:47,332 --> 00:00:59,165
 and become a scourge unto the Nephites. About

6
00:00:59,165 --> 00:01:10,998
 588–559 B.C.

7
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:19,772
1 Behold, it came to pass that I, Nephi, did cry

8
00:01:19,772 --> 00:01:27,772
 much unto the Lord my God, because of the anger of

9
00:01:27,772 --> 00:01:35,772
 my brethren

10
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,696
2 But behold, their anger did increase against me,

11
00:01:37,696 --> 00:01:39,696
 insomuch that they did seek to take away my life

12
00:01:39,696 --> 00:01:41,696


13
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:52,73
3 Yea, they did murmur against me, saying: Our

14
00:01:52,73 --> 00:02:04,159
 younger brother thinks to rule over us; and we have

15
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:15,588
 had much trial because of him; wherefore, now let

16
00:02:15,588 --> 00:02:27,017
 us slay him, that we may not be afflicted more

17
00:02:27,017 --> 00:02:38,446
 because of his words. For behold, we will not have him

18
00:02:38,446 --> 00:02:49,875
 to be our ruler; for it belongs unto us, who are

19
00:02:49,875 --> 00:03:01,304
 the elder brethren, to rule over this people

20
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:08,798
4 Now I do not write upon these plates all the

21
00:03:08,798 --> 00:03:16,548
 words which they murmured against me. But it

22
00:03:16,548 --> 00:03:24,298
 sufficeth me to say, that they did seek to take away my

23
00:03:24,298 --> 00:03:32,048
 life

24
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:33,946
5 And it came to pass that the Lord did warn me,

25
00:03:33,946 --> 00:03:34,946
 that I, Nephi, should depart from them and flee

26
00:03:34,946 --> 00:03:35,946
 into the wilderness, and all those who would go with

27
00:03:35,946 --> 00:03:36,946
 me

28
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:40,141
6 Wherefore, it came to pass that I, Nephi, did

29
00:03:40,141 --> 00:03:44,266
 take my family, and also Zoram and his family, and

30
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:48,391
 Sam, mine elder brother and his family, and Jacob

31
00:03:48,391 --> 00:03:52,516
 and Joseph, my younger brethren, and also my

32
00:03:52,516 --> 00:03:56,641
 sisters, and all those who would go with me. And all

33
00:03:56,641 --> 00:04:00,766
 those who would go with me were those who believed in

34
00:04:00,766 --> 00:04:04,891
 the warnings and the revelations of God;

35
00:04:04,891 --> 00:04:09,016
 wherefore, they did hearken unto my words

36
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:12,716
7 And we did take our tents and whatsoever things

37
00:04:12,716 --> 00:04:16,116
 were possible for us, and did journey in the

38
00:04:16,116 --> 00:04:19,516
 wilderness for the space of many days. And after we had

39
00:04:19,516 --> 00:04:22,916
 journeyed for the space of many days we did pitch

40
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:26,316
 our tents

41
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:50,233
8 And my people would that we should call the name

42
00:04:50,233 --> 00:05:14,233
 of the place Nephi; wherefore, we did call it

43
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:38,233
 Nephi

44
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:49,504
9 And all those who were with me did take upon

45
00:05:49,504 --> 00:06:01,004
 them to call themselves the people of Nephi

46
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:09,928
10 And we did observe to keep the judgments, and

47
00:06:09,928 --> 00:06:17,928
 the statutes, and the commandments of the Lord in

48
00:06:17,928 --> 00:06:25,928
 all things, according to the law of Moses

49
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:47,852
11 And the Lord was with us; and we did prosper

50
00:06:47,852 --> 00:07:09,852
 exceedingly; for we did sow seed, and we did reap

51
00:07:09,852 --> 00:07:31,852
 again in abundance. And we began to raise flocks,

52
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:53,852
 and herds, and animals of every kind

53
00:07:53,573 --> 00:08:17,573
12 And I, Nephi, had also brought the records

54
00:08:17,573 --> 00:08:41,573
 which were engraven upon the plates of brass; and also

55
00:08:41,573 --> 00:09:05,573
 the ball, or compass, which was prepared for my

56
00:09:05,573 --> 00:09:29,573
 father by the hand of the Lord, according to that

57
00:09:29,573 --> 00:09:53,573
 which is written

58
00:09:53,193 --> 00:10:28,693
13 And it came to pass that we began to prosper

59
00:10:28,693 --> 00:11:04,193
 exceedingly, and to multiply in the land

60
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:08,964
14 And I, Nephi, did take the sword of Laban, and

61
00:11:08,964 --> 00:11:12,964
 after the manner of it did make many swords, lest

62
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:16,964
 by any means the people who were now called

63
00:11:16,964 --> 00:11:20,964
 Lamanites should come upon us and destroy us; for I knew

64
00:11:20,964 --> 00:11:24,964
 their hatred towards me and my children and those

65
00:11:24,964 --> 00:11:28,964
 who were called my people

66
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:30,488
15 And I did teach my people to build buildings,

67
00:11:30,488 --> 00:11:32,088
 and to work in all manner of wood, and of iron, and

68
00:11:32,088 --> 00:11:33,688
 of copper, and of brass, and of steel, and of

69
00:11:33,688 --> 00:11:35,288
 gold, and of silver, and of precious ores, which were

70
00:11:35,288 --> 00:11:36,888
 in great abundance

71
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:45,863
16 And I, Nephi, did build a temple; and I did

72
00:11:45,863 --> 00:11:54,863
 construct it after the manner of the temple of

73
00:11:54,863 --> 00:12:03,863
 Solomon save it were not built of so many precious

74
00:12:03,863 --> 00:12:12,863
 things; for they were not to be found upon the land,

75
00:12:12,863 --> 00:12:21,863
 wherefore, it could not be built like unto Solomon’s

76
00:12:21,863 --> 00:12:30,863
 temple. But the manner of the construction was

77
00:12:30,863 --> 00:12:39,863
 like unto the temple of Solomon; and the workmanship

78
00:12:39,863 --> 00:12:48,863
 thereof was exceedingly fine

79
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:59,302
17 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did cause my

80
00:12:59,302 --> 00:13:09,969
 people to be industrious, and to labor with their

81
00:13:09,969 --> 00:13:20,636
 hands

82
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:26,533
18 And it came to pass that they would that I

83
00:13:26,533 --> 00:13:32,533
 should be their king. But I, Nephi, was desirous that

84
00:13:32,533 --> 00:13:38,533
 they should have no king; nevertheless, I did for

85
00:13:38,533 --> 00:13:44,533
 them according to that which was in my power

86
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:45,79
19 And behold, the words of the Lord had been

87
00:13:45,79 --> 00:13:47,123
 fulfilled unto my brethren, which he spake concerning

88
00:13:47,123 --> 00:13:48,456
 them, that I should be their ruler and their

89
00:13:48,456 --> 00:13:49,789
 teacher. Wherefore, I had been their ruler and their

90
00:13:49,789 --> 00:13:51,122
 teacher, according to the commandments of the Lord,

91
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:52,455
 until the time they sought to take away my life

92
00:13:52,432 --> 00:14:00,432
20 Wherefore, the word of the Lord was fulfilled

93
00:14:00,432 --> 00:14:08,432
 which he spake unto me, saying that: Inasmuch as

94
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:16,432
 they will not hearken unto thy words they shall be

95
00:14:16,432 --> 00:14:24,432
 cut off from the presence of the Lord. And behold,

96
00:14:24,432 --> 00:14:32,432
 they were cut off from his presence

97
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:17,772
23 And cursed shall be the seed of him that mixeth

98
00:01:17,772 --> 00:01:23,772
 with their seed; for they shall be cursed even

99
00:01:23,772 --> 00:01:29,772
 with the same cursing. And the Lord spake it, and it

100
00:01:29,772 --> 00:01:35,772
 was done

101
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:43,696
24 And because of their cursing which was upon

102
00:01:43,696 --> 00:01:51,696
 them they did become an idle people, full of mischief

103
00:01:51,696 --> 00:01:59,696
 and subtlety, and did seek in the wilderness for

104
00:01:59,696 --> 00:02:07,696
 beasts of prey

105
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:17,194
25 And the Lord God said unto me: They shall be a

106
00:02:17,194 --> 00:02:26,794
 scourge unto thy seed, to stir them up in

107
00:02:26,794 --> 00:02:36,394
 remembrance of me; and inasmuch as they will not remember

108
00:02:36,394 --> 00:02:45,994
 me, and hearken unto my words, they shall scourge

109
00:02:45,994 --> 00:02:55,594
 them even unto destruction

110
00:02:55,442 --> 00:03:22,109
26 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did

111
00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:48,776
 consecrate Jacob and Joseph, that they should be priests

112
00:03:48,776 --> 00:04:15,443
 and teachers over the land of my people

113
00:04:15,188 --> 00:05:10,688
27 And it came to pass that we lived after the

114
00:05:10,688 --> 00:06:06,188
 manner of happiness

115
00:06:06,833 --> 00:07:06,833
28 And thirty years had passed away from the time

116
00:07:06,833 --> 00:08:06,833
 we left Jerusalem

117
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:26,453
29 And I, Nephi, had kept the records upon my

118
00:08:26,453 --> 00:08:46,453
 plates, which I had made, of my people thus far

119
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:48,326
30 And it came to pass that the Lord God said unto

120
00:08:48,326 --> 00:08:50,326
 me: Make other plates; and thou shalt engraven

121
00:08:50,326 --> 00:08:52,326
 many things upon them which are good in my sight,

122
00:08:52,326 --> 00:08:54,326
 for the profit of thy people

123
00:08:54,3 --> 00:09:02,3
31 Wherefore, I, Nephi, to be obedient to the

124
00:09:02,3 --> 00:09:10,3
 commandments of the Lord, went and made these plates

125
00:09:10,3 --> 00:09:18,3
 upon which I have engraven these things

126
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:24,224
32 And I engraved that which is pleasing unto God.

127
00:09:24,224 --> 00:09:30,224
 And if my people are pleased with the things of

128
00:09:30,224 --> 00:09:36,224
 God they will be pleased with mine engravings which

129
00:09:36,224 --> 00:09:42,224
 are upon these plates

130
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,815
33 And if my people desire to know the more

131
00:09:44,815 --> 00:09:47,482
 particular part of the history of my people they must

132
00:09:47,482 --> 00:09:50,149
 search mine other plates

133
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:50,123
34 And it sufficeth me to say that forty years had

134
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:50,123
 passed away, and we had already had wars and

135
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:50,123
 contentions with our brethren.
