00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 9 Jacob explains that the Jews will be

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
gathered in all their lands of promise—The

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Atonement ransoms man from the Fall—The bodies of

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the dead will come forth from the grave, and

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
their spirits from hell and from paradise—They

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
will be judged—The Atonement saves from death,

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
hell, the devil, and endless torment—The righteous

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
are to be saved in the kingdom of

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
God—Penalties for sins are set forth—The Holy One of Israel

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:07:30,
is the keeper of the gate. About 559–545 B.C. 

11
00:07:30,0 --> 00:07:30,0
1 And now, my beloved brethren, I have

12
00:07:30,0 --> 00:07:30,0
read these things that ye might know

13
00:07:30,0 --> 00:07:30,0
concerning the covenants of the Lord that he

14
00:07:30,0 --> 00:14:38,
has covenanted with all the house of Israel—

15
00:14:38,0 --> 00:14:38,0
2 That he has spoken unto the Jews,

16
00:14:38,0 --> 00:14:38,0
by the mouth of his holy prophets,

17
00:14:38,0 --> 00:14:38,0
even from the beginning down, from

18
00:14:38,0 --> 00:14:38,0
generation to generation, until the time

19
00:14:38,0 --> 00:14:38,0
comes that they shall be restored to

20
00:14:38,0 --> 00:14:38,0
the true church and fold of God; when

21
00:14:38,0 --> 00:14:38,0
they shall be gathered home to the

22
00:14:38,0 --> 00:14:38,0
lands of their inheritance, and shall

23
00:14:38,0 --> 00:31:03,
be established in all their lands of promise.

24
00:31:03,0 --> 00:31:03,0
3 Behold, my beloved brethren,

25
00:31:03,0 --> 00:31:03,0
I speak unto you these things

26
00:31:03,0 --> 00:31:03,0
that ye may rejoice, and lift up

27
00:31:03,0 --> 00:31:03,0
your heads forever, because of

28
00:31:03,0 --> 00:31:03,0
the blessings which the Lord

29
00:31:03,0 --> 00:33:15,
God shall bestow upon your children.

30
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
4 For I know that ye have

31
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
searched much, many of you, to

32
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
know of things to come;

33
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
wherefore I know that ye know

34
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
that our flesh must waste

35
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
away and die; nevertheless, in

36
00:33:15,0 --> 00:46:10,
our bodies we shall see God.

37
00:46:10,0 --> 00:46:10,0
5 Yea, I know that ye know

38
00:46:10,0 --> 00:46:10,0
that in the body he shall

39
00:46:10,0 --> 00:46:10,0
show himself unto those at

40
00:46:10,0 --> 00:46:10,0
Jerusalem, from whence we

41
00:46:10,0 --> 00:46:10,0
came; for it is expedient

42
00:46:10,0 --> 00:46:10,0
that it should be among them;

43
00:46:10,0 --> 00:46:10,0
for it behooveth the great

44
00:46:10,0 --> 00:46:10,0
Creator that he suffereth

45
00:46:10,0 --> 00:46:10,0
himself to become subject

46
00:46:10,0 --> 00:46:10,0
unto man in the flesh, and

47
00:46:10,0 --> 00:46:10,0
die for all men, that all men

48
00:46:10,0 --> 00:48:22,
might become subject unto him.

49
00:48:22,0 --> 00:48:22,0
6 For as death hath

50
00:48:22,0 --> 00:48:22,0
passed upon all men, to fulfil

51
00:48:22,0 --> 00:48:22,0
the merciful plan of the

52
00:48:22,0 --> 00:48:22,0
great Creator, there

53
00:48:22,0 --> 00:48:22,0
must needs be a power of

54
00:48:22,0 --> 00:48:22,0
resurrection, and the

55
00:48:22,0 --> 00:48:22,0
resurrection must needs come

56
00:48:22,0 --> 00:48:22,0
unto man by reason of the

57
00:48:22,0 --> 00:48:22,0
fall; and the fall came by

58
00:48:22,0 --> 00:48:22,0
reason of transgression;

59
00:48:22,0 --> 00:48:22,0
and because man became

60
00:48:22,0 --> 00:48:22,0
fallen they were cut off

61
00:48:22,0 --> 00:53:19,
from the presence of the Lord.

62
00:53:19,0 --> 00:53:19,0
7 Wherefore, it must

63
00:53:19,0 --> 00:53:19,0
needs be an infinite

64
00:53:19,0 --> 00:53:19,0
atonement—save it should be an

65
00:53:19,0 --> 00:53:19,0
infinite atonement this

66
00:53:19,0 --> 00:53:19,0
corruption could not

67
00:53:19,0 --> 00:53:19,0
put on incorruption.

68
00:53:19,0 --> 00:53:19,0
Wherefore, the first judgment

69
00:53:19,0 --> 00:53:19,0
which came upon man

70
00:53:19,0 --> 00:53:19,0
must needs have remained to

71
00:53:19,0 --> 00:53:19,0
an endless duration.

72
00:53:19,0 --> 00:53:19,0
And if so, this flesh must

73
00:53:19,0 --> 00:53:19,0
have laid down to rot

74
00:53:19,0 --> 00:53:19,0
and to crumble to its

75
00:53:19,0 --> 00:57:03,
mother earth, to rise no more.

76
00:57:03,0 --> 00:57:03,0
8 O the wisdom of God,

77
00:57:03,0 --> 00:57:03,0
his mercy and grace!

78
00:57:03,0 --> 00:57:03,0
For behold, if the

79
00:57:03,0 --> 00:57:03,0
flesh should rise no more

80
00:57:03,0 --> 00:57:03,0
our spirits must

81
00:57:03,0 --> 00:57:03,0
become subject to that

82
00:57:03,0 --> 00:57:03,0
angel who fell from

83
00:57:03,0 --> 00:57:03,0
before the presence of the

84
00:57:03,0 --> 00:57:03,0
Eternal God, and

85
00:57:03,0 --> 00:57:33,
became the devil, to rise no more.

86
00:57:33,0 --> 00:57:33,0
9 And our spirits

87
00:57:33,0 --> 00:57:33,0
must have become like

88
00:57:33,0 --> 00:57:33,0
unto him, and we become

89
00:57:33,0 --> 00:57:33,0
devils, angels to a

90
00:57:33,0 --> 00:57:33,0
devil, to be shut out

91
00:57:33,0 --> 00:57:33,0
from the presence of

92
00:57:33,0 --> 00:57:33,0
our God, and to

93
00:57:33,0 --> 00:57:33,0
remain with the father of

94
00:57:33,0 --> 00:57:33,0
lies, in misery,

95
00:57:33,0 --> 00:57:33,0
like unto himself; yea,

96
00:57:33,0 --> 00:57:33,0
to that being who

97
00:57:33,0 --> 00:57:33,0
beguiled our first

98
00:57:33,0 --> 00:57:33,0
parents, who transformeth

99
00:57:33,0 --> 00:57:33,0
himself nigh unto an

100
00:57:33,0 --> 00:57:33,0
angel of light, and

101
00:57:33,0 --> 00:57:33,0
stirreth up the

102
00:57:33,0 --> 00:57:33,0
children of men unto secret

103
00:57:33,0 --> 00:57:33,0
combinations of

104
00:57:33,0 --> 00:57:33,0
murder and all manner of

105
00:57:33,0 --> 00:59:17,
secret works of darkness.

106
00:59:17,0 --> 00:59:17,0
10 O how great the

107
00:59:17,0 --> 00:59:17,0
goodness of our

108
00:59:17,0 --> 00:59:17,0
God, who prepareth a

109
00:59:17,0 --> 00:59:17,0
way for our escape

110
00:59:17,0 --> 00:59:17,0
from the grasp of

111
00:59:17,0 --> 00:59:17,0
this awful monster;

112
00:59:17,0 --> 00:59:17,0
yea, that monster,

113
00:59:17,0 --> 00:59:17,0
death and hell,

114
00:59:17,0 --> 00:59:17,0
which I call the death

115
00:59:17,0 --> 00:59:17,0
of the body, and

116
00:59:17,0 --> 01:01:01,
also the death of the spirit.

117
01:01:01,0 --> 01:01:01,0
11 And because of

118
01:01:01,0 --> 01:01:01,0
the way of

119
01:01:01,0 --> 01:01:01,0
deliverance of our God,

120
01:01:01,0 --> 01:01:01,0
the Holy One of

121
01:01:01,0 --> 01:01:01,0
Israel, this death,

122
01:01:01,0 --> 01:01:01,0
of which I have

123
01:01:01,0 --> 01:01:01,0
spoken, which is the

124
01:01:01,0 --> 01:01:01,0
temporal, shall

125
01:01:01,0 --> 01:01:01,0
deliver up its dead;

126
01:01:01,0 --> 01:08:30,
which death is the grave.

127
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
12 And this death

128
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
of which I have

129
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
spoken, which is

130
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
the spiritual

131
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
death, shall deliver

132
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
up its dead;

133
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
which spiritual

134
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
death is hell;

135
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
wherefore, death and

136
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
hell must deliver

137
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
up their dead, and

138
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
hell must

139
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
deliver up its captive

140
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
spirits, and the

141
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
grave must

142
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
deliver up its captive

143
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
bodies, and the

144
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
bodies and the

145
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
spirits of men will

146
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
be restored one

147
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
to the other; and

148
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
it is by the

149
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
power of the

150
01:08:30,0 --> 01:13:58,
resurrection of the Holy One of Israel.

151
01:13:58,0 --> 01:13:58,0
13 O how great

152
01:13:58,0 --> 01:13:58,0
the plan of our

153
01:13:58,0 --> 01:13:58,0
God! For on the

154
01:13:58,0 --> 01:13:58,0
other hand, the

155
01:13:58,0 --> 01:13:58,0
paradise of God

156
01:13:58,0 --> 01:13:58,0
must deliver up

157
01:13:58,0 --> 01:13:58,0
the spirits of

158
01:13:58,0 --> 01:13:58,0
the righteous, and

159
01:13:58,0 --> 01:13:58,0
the grave

160
01:13:58,0 --> 01:13:58,0
deliver up the body

161
01:13:58,0 --> 01:13:58,0
of the righteous;

162
01:13:58,0 --> 01:13:58,0
and the spirit

163
01:13:58,0 --> 01:13:58,0
and the body is

164
01:13:58,0 --> 01:13:58,0
restored to

165
01:13:58,0 --> 01:13:58,0
itself again, and

166
01:13:58,0 --> 01:13:58,0
all men become

167
01:13:58,0 --> 01:13:58,0
incorruptible, and

168
01:13:58,0 --> 01:13:58,0
immortal, and

169
01:13:58,0 --> 01:13:58,0
they are living

170
01:13:58,0 --> 01:13:58,0
souls, having a

171
01:13:58,0 --> 01:13:58,0
perfect knowledge

172
01:13:58,0 --> 01:13:58,0
like unto us in

173
01:13:58,0 --> 01:13:58,0
the flesh, save

174
01:13:58,0 --> 01:13:58,0
it be that our

175
01:13:58,0 --> 01:13:44,
knowledge shall be perfect.

176
01:13:44,0 --> 01:13:44,0
14 Wherefore,

177
01:13:44,0 --> 01:13:44,0
we shall have a

178
01:13:44,0 --> 01:13:44,0
perfect

179
01:13:44,0 --> 01:13:44,0
knowledge of all our

180
01:13:44,0 --> 01:13:44,0
guilt, and our

181
01:13:44,0 --> 01:13:44,0
uncleanness, and

182
01:13:44,0 --> 01:13:44,0
our nakedness;

183
01:13:44,0 --> 01:13:44,0
and the

184
01:13:44,0 --> 01:13:44,0
righteous shall have

185
01:13:44,0 --> 01:13:44,0
a perfect

186
01:13:44,0 --> 01:13:44,0
knowledge of their

187
01:13:44,0 --> 01:13:44,0
enjoyment, and

188
01:13:44,0 --> 01:13:44,0
their

189
01:13:44,0 --> 01:13:44,0
righteousness, being

190
01:13:44,0 --> 01:13:44,0
clothed with

191
01:13:44,0 --> 01:13:44,0
purity, yea, even

192
01:13:44,0 --> 01:25:40,
with the robe of righteousness.

193
01:25:40,0 --> 01:25:40,0
15 And it

194
01:25:40,0 --> 01:25:40,0
shall come to pass

195
01:25:40,0 --> 01:25:40,0
that when all

196
01:25:40,0 --> 01:25:40,0
men shall

197
01:25:40,0 --> 01:25:40,0
have passed from

198
01:25:40,0 --> 01:25:40,0
this first

199
01:25:40,0 --> 01:25:40,0
death unto life,

200
01:25:40,0 --> 01:25:40,0
insomuch as

201
01:25:40,0 --> 01:25:40,0
they have become

202
01:25:40,0 --> 01:25:40,0
immortal,

203
01:25:40,0 --> 01:25:40,0
they must appear

204
01:25:40,0 --> 01:25:40,0
before the

205
01:25:40,0 --> 01:25:40,0
judgment-seat of

206
01:25:40,0 --> 01:25:40,0
the Holy One

207
01:25:40,0 --> 01:25:40,0
of Israel; and

208
01:25:40,0 --> 01:25:40,0
then cometh

209
01:25:40,0 --> 01:25:40,0
the judgment,

210
01:25:40,0 --> 01:25:40,0
and then must

211
01:25:40,0 --> 01:25:40,0
they be judged

212
01:25:40,0 --> 01:25:40,0
according to

213
01:25:40,0 --> 01:25:26,
the holy judgment of God.

214
01:25:26,0 --> 01:25:26,0
16 And

215
01:25:26,0 --> 01:25:26,0
assuredly, as the

216
01:25:26,0 --> 01:25:26,0
Lord liveth,

217
01:25:26,0 --> 01:25:26,0
for the Lord

218
01:25:26,0 --> 01:25:26,0
God hath

219
01:25:26,0 --> 01:25:26,0
spoken it, and it

220
01:25:26,0 --> 01:25:26,0
is his

221
01:25:26,0 --> 01:25:26,0
eternal word, which

222
01:25:26,0 --> 01:25:26,0
cannot pass

223
01:25:26,0 --> 01:25:26,0
away, that

224
01:25:26,0 --> 01:25:26,0
they who are

225
01:25:26,0 --> 01:25:26,0
righteous shall

226
01:25:26,0 --> 01:25:26,0
be righteous

227
01:25:26,0 --> 01:25:26,0
still, and

228
01:25:26,0 --> 01:25:26,0
they who are

229
01:25:26,0 --> 01:25:26,0
filthy shall

230
01:25:26,0 --> 01:25:26,0
be filthy

231
01:25:26,0 --> 01:25:26,0
still; wherefore,

232
01:25:26,0 --> 01:25:26,0
they who are

233
01:25:26,0 --> 01:25:26,0
filthy are

234
01:25:26,0 --> 01:25:26,0
the devil and

235
01:25:26,0 --> 01:25:26,0
his angels;

236
01:25:26,0 --> 01:25:26,0
and they shall

237
01:25:26,0 --> 01:25:26,0
go away into

238
01:25:26,0 --> 01:25:26,0
everlasting

239
01:25:26,0 --> 01:25:26,0
fire,

240
01:25:26,0 --> 01:25:26,0
prepared for them;

241
01:25:26,0 --> 01:25:26,0
and their

242
01:25:26,0 --> 01:25:26,0
torment is as a

243
01:25:26,0 --> 01:25:26,0
lake of fire

244
01:25:26,0 --> 01:25:26,0
and brimstone,

245
01:25:26,0 --> 01:25:26,0
whose flame

246
01:25:26,0 --> 01:25:12,
ascendeth up forever and ever and has no end.

247
01:25:12,0 --> 01:25:12,0
17 O the

248
01:25:12,0 --> 01:25:12,0
greatness and

249
01:25:12,0 --> 01:25:12,0

250
01:25:12,0 --> 01:25:12,0
of our God!

251
01:25:12,0 --> 01:25:12,0
For he

252
01:25:12,0 --> 01:25:12,0
executeth all his

253
01:25:12,0 --> 01:25:12,0
words, and

254
01:25:12,0 --> 01:25:12,0
they have

255
01:25:12,0 --> 01:25:12,0
gone forth out

256
01:25:12,0 --> 01:25:12,0
of his

257
01:25:12,0 --> 01:25:12,0
mouth, and his

258
01:25:12,0 --> 01:24:44,
law must be fulfilled.

259
01:24:44,0 --> 01:24:44,0
18 But,

260
01:24:44,0 --> 01:24:44,0
behold, the

261
01:24:44,0 --> 01:24:44,0

01:24:44,0 --> 01:24:44,0
the saints of

01:24:44,0 --> 01:24:44,0
the Holy

01:24:44,0 --> 01:24:44,0
One of

265
01:24:44,0 --> 01:24:44,0
Israel, they who

266
01:24:44,0 --> 01:24:44,0
have

267
01:24:44,0 --> 01:24:44,0
believed in the

268
01:24:44,0 --> 01:24:44,0
Holy One of

01:24:44,0 --> 01:24:44,0

270
01:24:44,0 --> 01:24:44,0
they who have

271
01:24:44,0 --> 01:24:44,0
endured

272
01:24:44,0 --> 01:24:44,0
the crosses

273
01:24:44,0 --> 01:24:44,0
of the

274
01:24:44,0 --> 01:24:44,0
world, and

275
01:24:44,0 --> 01:24:44,0
despised the

276
01:24:44,0 --> 01:24:44,0
shame of it,

277
01:24:44,0 --> 01:24:44,0
they shall

278
01:24:44,0 --> 01:24:44,0
inherit the

279
01:24:44,0 --> 01:24:44,0

280
01:24:44,0 --> 01:24:44,0
God, which

281
01:24:44,0 --> 01:24:44,0
was

282
01:24:44,0 --> 01:24:44,0
prepared for them

283
01:24:44,0 --> 01:24:44,0
from the

284
01:24:44,0 --> 01:24:44,0
foundation of

285
01:24:44,0 --> 01:24:44,0
the world,

286
01:24:44,0 --> 01:25:56,
and their joy shall be full forever.

287
01:25:56,0 --> 01:25:56,0
19 O the

01:25:56,0 --> 01:25:56,0
Israel!

294
01:25:56,0 --> 01:25:56,0
For he

297
01:25:56,0 --> 01:25:56,0
from that

298
01:25:56,0 --> 01:25:56,0
awful monster

299
01:25:56,0 --> 01:25:56,0
the

300
01:25:56,0 --> 01:25:56,0

301
01:25:56,0 --> 01:25:56,0
death, and

302
01:25:56,0 --> 01:25:56,0
hell, and

303
01:25:56,0 --> 01:25:56,0

304
01:25:56,0 --> 01:25:56,0
fire and

305
01:25:56,0 --> 01:25:56,0
brimstone,

306
01:25:56,0 --> 01:39:37,
which is endless torment.

307
01:39:37,0 --> 01:39:37,0
20 O how

For he
