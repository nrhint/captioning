00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:13,5
Chapter 9 Jacob explains that the Jews will be

2
00:00:13,5 --> 00:00:27,0
 gathered in all their lands of promise—The Atonement

3
00:00:27,0 --> 00:00:40,5
 ransoms man from the Fall—The bodies of the dead

4
00:00:40,5 --> 00:00:54,0
 will come forth from the grave, and their spirits

5
00:00:54,0 --> 00:01:07,5
 from hell and from paradise—They will be judged—The

6
00:01:07,5 --> 00:01:21,0
 Atonement saves from death, hell, the devil, and

7
00:01:21,0 --> 00:01:34,5
 endless torment—The righteous are to be saved in

8
00:01:34,5 --> 00:01:48,0
 the kingdom of God—Penalties for sins are set

9
00:01:48,0 --> 00:02:01,5
 forth—The Holy One of Israel is the keeper of the gate.

10
00:02:01,5 --> 00:02:15,0
 About 559–545 B.C.

11
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:15,819
1 And now, my beloved brethren, I have read these

12
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:16,069
 things that ye might know concerning the covenants

13
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:16,319
 of the Lord that he has covenanted with all the

14
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:16,569
 house of Israel

15
00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:21,574
2 That he has spoken unto the Jews, by the mouth

16
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:27,145
 of his holy prophets, even from the beginning down,

17
00:02:27,145 --> 00:02:32,716
 from generation to generation, until the time

18
00:02:32,716 --> 00:02:38,287
 comes that they shall be restored to the true church

19
00:02:38,287 --> 00:02:43,858
 and fold of God; when they shall be gathered home

20
00:02:43,858 --> 00:02:49,429
 to the lands of their inheritance, and shall be

21
00:02:49,429 --> 00:02:54,0
 established in all their lands of promise

22
00:02:55,175 --> 00:03:01,675
3 Behold, my beloved brethren, I speak unto you

23
00:03:01,675 --> 00:03:08,175
 these things that ye may rejoice, and lift up your

24
00:03:08,175 --> 00:03:14,675
 heads forever, because of the blessings which the

25
00:03:14,675 --> 00:03:21,175
 Lord God shall bestow upon your children

26
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:29,384
4 For I know that ye have searched much, many of

27
00:03:29,384 --> 00:03:37,634
 you, to know of things to come; wherefore I know

28
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:45,884
 that ye know that our flesh must waste away and die;

29
00:03:45,884 --> 00:03:54,134
 nevertheless, in our bodies we shall see God

30
00:03:54,434 --> 00:04:00,863
5 Yea, I know that ye know that in the body he

31
00:04:00,863 --> 00:04:07,292
 shall show himself unto those at Jerusalem, from

32
00:04:07,292 --> 00:04:13,721
 whence we came; for it is expedient that it should be

33
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:20,15
 among them; for it behooveth the great Creator

34
00:04:20,15 --> 00:04:26,579
 that he suffereth himself to become subject unto man

35
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:33,008
 in the flesh, and die for all men, that all men

36
00:04:33,008 --> 00:04:39,437
 might become subject unto him

37
00:04:39,88 --> 00:04:46,594
6 For as death hath passed upon all men, to fulfil

38
00:04:46,594 --> 00:04:53,308
 the merciful plan of the great Creator, there

39
00:04:53,308 --> 00:05:00,022
 must needs be a power of resurrection, and the

40
00:05:00,022 --> 00:05:06,736
 resurrection must needs come unto man by reason of the

41
00:05:06,736 --> 00:05:13,45
 fall; and the fall came by reason of transgression;

42
00:05:13,45 --> 00:05:20,164
 and because man became fallen they were cut off

43
00:05:20,164 --> 00:05:26,878
 from the presence of the Lord

44
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:35,202
7 Wherefore, it must needs be an infinite

45
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:44,345
 atonement—save it should be an infinite atonement this

46
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:53,488
 corruption could not put on incorruption. Wherefore,

47
00:05:53,488 --> 00:06:02,631
 the first judgment which came upon man must needs

48
00:06:02,631 --> 00:06:11,774
 have remained to an endless duration. And if so,

49
00:06:11,774 --> 00:06:20,917
 this flesh must have laid down to rot and to

50
00:06:20,917 --> 00:06:30,06
 crumble to its mother earth, to rise no more

51
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:37,524
8 O the wisdom of God, his mercy and grace! For

52
00:06:37,524 --> 00:06:44,124
 behold, if the flesh should rise no more our spirits

53
00:06:44,124 --> 00:06:50,724
 must become subject to that angel who fell from

54
00:06:50,724 --> 00:06:57,324
 before the presence of the Eternal God, and became

55
00:06:57,324 --> 00:07:03,924
 the devil, to rise no more

56
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:10,667
9 And our spirits must have become like unto him,

57
00:07:10,667 --> 00:07:18,111
 and we become devils, angels to a devil, to be

58
00:07:18,111 --> 00:07:25,555
 shut out from the presence of our God, and to remain

59
00:07:25,555 --> 00:07:32,999
 with the father of lies, in misery, like unto

60
00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:40,443
 himself; yea, to that being who beguiled our first

61
00:07:40,443 --> 00:07:47,887
 parents, who transformeth himself nigh unto an angel

62
00:07:47,887 --> 00:07:55,331
 of light, and stirreth up the children of men unto

63
00:07:55,331 --> 00:08:02,775
 secret combinations of murder and all manner of

64
00:08:02,775 --> 00:08:10,219
 secret works of darkness

65
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:18,157
10 O how great the goodness of our God, who

66
00:08:18,157 --> 00:08:26,157
 prepareth a way for our escape from the grasp of this

67
00:08:26,157 --> 00:08:34,157
 awful monster; yea, that monster, death and hell,

68
00:08:34,157 --> 00:08:42,157
 which I call the death of the body, and also the

69
00:08:42,157 --> 00:08:50,157
 death of the spirit

70
00:08:50,03 --> 00:08:56,78
11 And because of the way of deliverance of our

71
00:08:56,78 --> 00:09:03,53
 God, the Holy One of Israel, this death, of which I

72
00:09:03,53 --> 00:09:10,28
 have spoken, which is the temporal, shall deliver

73
00:09:10,28 --> 00:09:17,03
 up its dead; which death is the grave

74
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:24,713
12 And this death of which I have spoken, which is

75
00:09:24,713 --> 00:09:31,935
 the spiritual death, shall deliver up its dead;

76
00:09:31,935 --> 00:09:39,157
 which spiritual death is hell; wherefore, death and

77
00:09:39,157 --> 00:09:46,379
 hell must deliver up their dead, and hell must

78
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:53,601
 deliver up its captive spirits, and the grave must

79
00:09:53,601 --> 00:10:00,823
 deliver up its captive bodies, and the bodies and

80
00:10:00,823 --> 00:10:08,045
 the spirits of men will be restored one to the

81
00:10:08,045 --> 00:10:15,267
 other; and it is by the power of the resurrection of

82
00:10:15,267 --> 00:10:22,489
 the Holy One of Israel

83
00:10:22,89 --> 00:10:29,557
13 O how great the plan of our God! For on the

84
00:10:29,557 --> 00:10:36,224
 other hand, the paradise of God must deliver up the

85
00:10:36,224 --> 00:10:42,891
 spirits of the righteous, and the grave deliver up

86
00:10:42,891 --> 00:10:49,558
 the body of the righteous; and the spirit and the

87
00:10:49,558 --> 00:10:56,225
 body is restored to itself again, and all men

88
00:10:56,225 --> 00:11:02,892
 become incorruptible, and immortal, and they are

89
00:11:02,892 --> 00:11:09,559
 living souls, having a perfect knowledge like unto us

90
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:16,226
 in the flesh, save it be that our knowledge shall

91
00:11:16,226 --> 00:11:22,893
 be perfect

92
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:29,55
14 Wherefore, we shall have a perfect knowledge of

93
00:11:29,55 --> 00:11:36,217
 all our guilt, and our uncleanness, and our

94
00:11:36,217 --> 00:11:42,884
 nakedness; and the righteous shall have a perfect

95
00:11:42,884 --> 00:11:49,551
 knowledge of their enjoyment, and their righteousness,

96
00:11:49,551 --> 00:11:56,218
 being clothed with purity, yea, even with the robe

97
00:11:56,218 --> 00:12:02,885
 of righteousness

98
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:08,432
15 And it shall come to pass that when all men

99
00:12:08,432 --> 00:12:14,575
 shall have passed from this first death unto life,

100
00:12:14,575 --> 00:12:20,718
 insomuch as they have become immortal, they must

101
00:12:20,718 --> 00:12:26,861
 appear before the judgment-seat of the Holy One of

102
00:12:26,861 --> 00:12:33,004
 Israel; and then cometh the judgment, and then must

103
00:12:33,004 --> 00:12:39,147
 they be judged according to the holy judgment of

104
00:12:39,147 --> 00:12:45,29
 God

105
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:52,632
16 And assuredly, as the Lord liveth, for the Lord

106
00:12:52,632 --> 00:13:00,032
 God hath spoken it, and it is his eternal word,

107
00:13:00,032 --> 00:13:07,432
 which cannot pass away, that they who are righteous

108
00:13:07,432 --> 00:13:14,832
 shall be righteous still, and they who are filthy

109
00:13:14,832 --> 00:13:22,232
 shall be filthy still; wherefore, they who are

110
00:13:22,232 --> 00:13:29,632
 filthy are the devil and his angels; and they shall

111
00:13:29,632 --> 00:13:37,032
 go away into everlasting fire, prepared for them;

112
00:13:37,032 --> 00:13:44,432
 and their torment is as a lake of fire and

113
00:13:44,432 --> 00:13:51,832
 brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever and

114
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:59,232
 has no end

115
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:05,923
17 O the greatness and the justice of our God! For

116
00:14:05,923 --> 00:14:12,173
 he executeth all his words, and they have gone

117
00:14:12,173 --> 00:14:18,423
 forth out of his mouth, and his law must be

118
00:14:18,423 --> 00:14:24,673
 fulfilled

119
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:32,108
18 But, behold, the righteous, the saints of the

120
00:14:32,108 --> 00:14:39,251
 Holy One of Israel, they who have believed in the

121
00:14:39,251 --> 00:14:46,394
 Holy One of Israel, they who have endured the

122
00:14:46,394 --> 00:14:53,537
 crosses of the world, and despised the shame of it,

123
00:14:53,537 --> 00:15:00,68
 they shall inherit the kingdom of God, which was

124
00:15:00,68 --> 00:15:07,823
 prepared for them from the foundation of the world,

125
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:14,966
 and their joy shall be full forever

126
00:15:14,982 --> 00:15:21,782
19 O the greatness of the mercy of our God, the

127
00:15:21,782 --> 00:15:28,582
 Holy One of Israel! For he delivereth his saints

128
00:15:28,582 --> 00:15:35,382
 from that awful monster the devil, and death, and

129
00:15:35,382 --> 00:15:42,182
 hell, and that lake of fire and brimstone, which is

130
00:15:42,182 --> 00:15:48,982
 endless torment

131
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:55,949
20 O how great the holiness of our God! For he

132
00:15:55,949 --> 00:16:02,949
 knoweth all things, and there is not anything save he

133
00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:09,949
 knows it

134
00:16:09,97 --> 00:16:11,57
21 And he cometh into the world that he may save

135
00:16:11,57 --> 00:16:13,17
 all men if they will hearken unto his voice; for

136
00:16:13,17 --> 00:16:14,77
 behold, he suffereth the pains of all men, yea, the

137
00:16:14,77 --> 00:16:16,37
 pains of every living creature, both men, women,

138
00:16:16,37 --> 00:16:17,97
 and children, who belong to the family of Adam

139
00:16:17,945 --> 00:16:23,278
22 And he suffereth this that the resurrection

140
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:28,611
 might pass upon all men, that all might stand before

141
00:16:28,611 --> 00:16:33,944
 him at the great and judgment day

142
00:16:33,894 --> 00:16:35,894
23 And he commandeth all men that they must

143
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:37,894
 repent, and be baptized in his name, having perfect

144
00:16:37,894 --> 00:16:39,894
 faith in the Holy One of Israel, or they cannot be

145
00:16:39,894 --> 00:16:41,894
 saved in the kingdom of God

146
00:16:41,869 --> 00:16:45,869
24 And if they will not repent and believe in his

147
00:16:45,869 --> 00:16:49,869
 name, and be baptized in his name, and endure to

148
00:16:49,869 --> 00:16:53,869
 the end, they must be damned; for the Lord God, the

149
00:16:53,869 --> 00:16:57,869
 Holy One of Israel, has spoken it

150
00:16:57,818 --> 00:16:58,961
25 Wherefore, he has given a law; and where there

151
00:16:58,961 --> 00:17:00,104
 is no law given there is no punishment; and where

152
00:17:00,104 --> 00:17:01,247
 there is no punishment there is no condemnation;

153
00:17:01,247 --> 00:17:02,39
 and where there is no condemnation the mercies of

154
00:17:02,39 --> 00:17:03,533
 the Holy One of Israel have claim upon them,

155
00:17:03,533 --> 00:17:04,676
 because of the atonement; for they are delivered by the

156
00:17:04,676 --> 00:17:05,819
 power of him

157
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:06,935
26 For the atonement satisfieth the demands of his

158
00:17:06,935 --> 00:17:08,078
 justice upon all those who have not the law given

159
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:09,221
 to them, that they are delivered from that awful

160
00:17:09,221 --> 00:17:10,364
 monster, death and hell, and the devil, and the

161
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:11,507
 lake of fire and brimstone, which is endless

162
00:17:11,507 --> 00:17:12,65
 torment; and they are restored to that God who gave them

163
00:17:12,65 --> 00:17:13,793
 breath, which is the Holy One of Israel

164
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:17,767
27 But wo unto him that has the law given, yea,

165
00:17:17,767 --> 00:17:21,767
 that has all the commandments of God, like unto us,

166
00:17:21,767 --> 00:17:25,767
 and that transgresseth them, and that wasteth the

167
00:17:25,767 --> 00:17:29,767
 days of his probation, for awful is his state

168
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:30,859
28 O that cunning plan of the evil one! O the

169
00:17:30,859 --> 00:17:32,002
 vainness, and the frailties, and the foolishness of

170
00:17:32,002 --> 00:17:33,145
 men! When they are learned they think they are wise,

171
00:17:33,145 --> 00:17:34,288
 and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for

172
00:17:34,288 --> 00:17:35,431
 they set it aside, supposing they know of

173
00:17:35,431 --> 00:17:36,574
 themselves, wherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and it

174
00:17:36,574 --> 00:17:37,717
 profiteth them not. And they shall perish

175
00:17:37,691 --> 00:17:41,691
29 But to be learned is good if they hearken unto

176
00:17:41,691 --> 00:17:45,691
 the counsels of God

177
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:46,999
30 But wo unto the rich, who are rich as to the

178
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,332
 things of the world. For because they are rich they

179
00:17:48,332 --> 00:17:49,665
 despise the poor, and they persecute the meek, and

180
00:17:49,665 --> 00:17:50,998
 their hearts are upon their treasures; wherefore,

181
00:17:50,998 --> 00:17:52,331
 their treasure is their god. And behold, their

182
00:17:52,331 --> 00:17:53,664
 treasure shall perish with them also

183
00:17:53,64 --> 00:17:57,64
31 And wo unto the deaf that will not hear; for

184
00:17:57,64 --> 00:18:01,64
 they shall perish

185
00:18:01,615 --> 00:18:05,615
32 Wo unto the blind that will not see; for they

186
00:18:05,615 --> 00:18:09,615
 shall perish also

187
00:18:09,59 --> 00:18:12,257
33 Wo unto the uncircumcised of heart, for a

188
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,924
 knowledge of their iniquities shall smite them at the

189
00:18:14,924 --> 00:18:17,591
 last day

190
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:21,564
34 Wo unto the liar, for he shall be thrust down

191
00:18:21,564 --> 00:18:25,564
 to hell

192
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:33,539
35 Wo unto the murderer who deliberately killeth,

193
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:41,539
 for he shall die

194
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:45,488
36 Wo unto them who commit whoredoms, for they

195
00:18:45,488 --> 00:18:49,488
 shall be thrust down to hell

196
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:57,463
37 Yea, wo unto those that worship idols, for the

197
00:18:57,463 --> 00:19:05,463
 devil of all devils delighteth in them

198
00:19:05,412 --> 00:19:13,412
38 And, in fine, wo unto all those who die in

199
00:19:13,412 --> 00:19:21,412
 their sins; for they shall return to God, and behold

200
00:19:21,412 --> 00:19:29,412
 his face, and remain in their sins

201
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:32,003
39 O, my beloved brethren, remember the awfulness

202
00:19:32,003 --> 00:19:34,67
 in transgressing against that Holy God, and also

203
00:19:34,67 --> 00:19:37,337
 the awfulness of yielding to the enticings of that

204
00:19:37,337 --> 00:19:40,004
 cunning one. Remember, to be carnally-minded is

205
00:19:40,004 --> 00:19:42,671
 death, and to be spiritually-minded is life eternal

206
00:19:42,671 --> 00:19:45,338


207
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:48,285
40 O, my beloved brethren, give ear to my words.

208
00:19:48,285 --> 00:19:51,285
 Remember the greatness of the Holy One of Israel.

209
00:19:51,285 --> 00:19:54,285
 Do not say that I have spoken hard things against

210
00:19:54,285 --> 00:19:57,285
 you; for if ye do, ye will revile against the

211
00:19:57,285 --> 00:20:00,285
 truth; for I have spoken the words of your Maker. I

212
00:20:00,285 --> 00:20:03,285
 know that the words of truth are hard against all

213
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:06,285
 uncleanness; but the righteous fear them not, for

214
00:20:06,285 --> 00:20:09,285
 they love the truth and are not shaken

215
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:10,209
41 O then, my beloved brethren, come unto the

216
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,209
 Lord, the Holy One. Remember that his paths are

217
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:12,209
 righteous. Behold, the way for man is narrow, but it

218
00:20:12,209 --> 00:20:13,209
 lieth in a straight course before him, and the keeper

219
00:20:13,209 --> 00:20:14,209
 of the gate is the Holy One of Israel; and he

220
00:20:14,209 --> 00:20:15,209
 employeth no servant there; and there is none other

221
00:20:15,209 --> 00:20:16,209
 way save it be by the gate; for he cannot be

222
00:20:16,209 --> 00:20:17,209
 deceived, for the Lord God is his name

223
00:20:17,184 --> 00:20:18,184
42 And whoso knocketh, to him will he open; and

224
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:19,184
 the wise, and the learned, and they that are rich,

225
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:20,184
 who are puffed up because of their learning, and

226
00:20:20,184 --> 00:20:21,184
 their wisdom, and their riches—yea, they are they

227
00:20:21,184 --> 00:20:22,184
 whom he despiseth; and save they shall cast these

228
00:20:22,184 --> 00:20:23,184
 things away, and consider themselves fools before

229
00:20:23,184 --> 00:20:24,184
 God, and come down in the depths of humility, he

230
00:20:24,184 --> 00:20:25,184
 will not open unto them

231
00:20:25,158 --> 00:20:27,825
43 But the things of the wise and the prudent

232
00:20:27,825 --> 00:20:30,492
 shall be hid from them forever—yea, that happiness

233
00:20:30,492 --> 00:20:33,159
 which is prepared for the saints

234
00:20:33,133 --> 00:20:34,022
44 O, my beloved brethren, remember my words.

235
00:20:34,022 --> 00:20:34,911
 Behold, I take off my garments, and I shake them

236
00:20:34,911 --> 00:20:35,8
 before you; I pray the God of my salvation that he view

237
00:20:35,8 --> 00:20:36,689
 me with his all-searching eye; wherefore, ye

238
00:20:36,689 --> 00:20:37,578
 shall know at the last day, when all men shall be

239
00:20:37,578 --> 00:20:38,467
 judged of their works, that the God of Israel did

240
00:20:38,467 --> 00:20:39,356
 witness that I shook your iniquities from my soul, and

241
00:20:39,356 --> 00:20:40,245
 that I stand with brightness before him, and am

242
00:20:40,245 --> 00:20:41,134
 rid of your blood

243
00:20:41,108 --> 00:20:43,108
45 O, my beloved brethren, turn away from your

244
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:45,108
 sins; shake off the chains of him that would bind you

245
00:20:45,108 --> 00:20:47,108
 fast; come unto that God who is the rock of your

246
00:20:47,108 --> 00:20:49,108
 salvation

247
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:50,682
46 Prepare your souls for that glorious day when

248
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:52,282
 justice shall be administered unto the righteous,

249
00:20:52,282 --> 00:20:53,882
 even the day of judgment, that ye may not shrink

250
00:20:53,882 --> 00:20:55,482
 with awful fear; that ye may not remember your awful

251
00:20:55,482 --> 00:20:57,082
 guilt in perfectness, and be constrained to

252
00:20:57,082 --> 00:20:58,682
 exclaim: Holy, holy are thy judgments, O Lord God

253
00:20:58,682 --> 00:21:00,282
 Almighty—but I know my guilt; I transgressed thy law,

254
00:21:00,282 --> 00:21:01,882
 and my transgressions are mine; and the devil hath

255
00:21:01,882 --> 00:21:03,482
 obtained me, that I am a prey to his awful misery

256
00:21:03,482 --> 00:21:05,082


257
00:21:05,032 --> 00:21:06,365
47 But behold, my brethren, is it expedient that I

258
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:07,698
 should awake you to an awful reality of these

259
00:21:07,698 --> 00:21:09,031
 things? Would I harrow up your souls if your minds

260
00:21:09,031 --> 00:21:10,364
 were pure? Would I be plain unto you according to

261
00:21:10,364 --> 00:21:11,697
 the plainness of the truth if ye were freed from

262
00:21:11,697 --> 00:21:13,03
 sin

263
00:21:13,006 --> 00:21:14,756
48 Behold, if ye were holy I would speak unto you

264
00:21:14,756 --> 00:21:16,506
 of holiness; but as ye are not holy, and ye look

265
00:21:16,506 --> 00:21:18,256
 upon me as a teacher, it must needs be expedient

266
00:21:18,256 --> 00:21:20,006
 that I teach you the consequences of sin

267
00:21:20,981 --> 00:21:23,648
49 Behold, my soul abhorreth sin, and my heart

268
00:21:23,648 --> 00:21:26,315
 delighteth in righteousness; and I will praise the

269
00:21:26,315 --> 00:21:28,982
 holy name of my God

270
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:30,956
50 Come, my brethren, every one that thirsteth,

271
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,956
 come ye to the waters; and he that hath no money,

272
00:21:32,956 --> 00:21:34,956
 come buy and eat; yea, come buy wine and milk

273
00:21:34,956 --> 00:21:36,956
 without money and without price

274
00:21:36,93 --> 00:21:39,216
51 Wherefore, do not spend money for that which is

275
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:41,502
 of no worth, nor your labor for that which cannot

276
00:21:41,502 --> 00:21:43,788
 satisfy. Hearken diligently unto me, and remember

277
00:21:43,788 --> 00:21:46,074
 the words which I have spoken; and come unto the

278
00:21:46,074 --> 00:21:48,36
 Holy One of Israel, and feast upon that which

279
00:21:48,36 --> 00:21:50,646
 perisheth not, neither can be corrupted, and let your

280
00:21:50,646 --> 00:21:52,932
 soul delight in fatness

281
00:21:52,88 --> 00:21:54,88
52 Behold, my beloved brethren, remember the words

282
00:21:54,88 --> 00:21:56,88
 of your God; pray unto him continually by day,

283
00:21:56,88 --> 00:21:58,88
 and give thanks unto his holy name by night. Let

284
00:21:58,88 --> 00:22:00,88
 your hearts rejoice

285
00:22:00,854 --> 00:22:01,854
53 And behold how great the covenants of the Lord,

286
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:02,854
 and how great his condescensions unto the

287
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:03,854
 children of men; and because of his greatness, and his

288
00:22:03,854 --> 00:22:04,854
 grace and mercy, he has promised unto us that our

289
00:22:04,854 --> 00:22:05,854
 seed shall not utterly be destroyed, according to

290
00:22:05,854 --> 00:22:06,854
 the flesh, but that he would preserve them; and in

291
00:22:06,854 --> 00:22:07,854
 future generations they shall become a righteous

292
00:22:07,854 --> 00:22:08,854
 branch unto the house of Israel

293
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:09,162
54 And now, my brethren, I would speak unto you

294
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:09,495
 more; but on the morrow I will declare unto you the

295
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:09,828
 remainder of my words. Amen.
