00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,556
Chapter 25 Nephi glories in

2
00:00:01,556 --> 00:00:03,112
plainness—Isaiah’s prophecies will be understood in the last

3
00:00:03,112 --> 00:00:04,668
days—The Jews will return from Babylon,

4
00:00:04,668 --> 00:00:06,224
crucify the Messiah, and be scattered and

5
00:00:06,224 --> 00:00:07,78
scourged—They will be restored when they believe in

6
00:00:07,78 --> 00:00:09,336
the Messiah—He will first come six hundred

7
00:00:09,336 --> 00:00:10,892
years after Lehi left Jerusalem—The Nephites keep

8
00:00:10,892 --> 00:00:12,448
the law of Moses and believe in Christ, who

9
00:00:12,448 --> 00:00:14,982
is the Holy One of Israel. About 559–545 B.C. 

10
00:00:14,982 --> 00:00:15,553
1 Now I, Nephi, do speak somewhat

11
00:00:15,553 --> 00:00:16,124
concerning the words which I have written,

12
00:00:16,124 --> 00:00:16,695
which have been spoken by the mouth of

13
00:00:16,695 --> 00:00:17,266
Isaiah. For behold, Isaiah spake many things

14
00:00:17,266 --> 00:00:17,837
which were hard for many of my people

15
00:00:17,837 --> 00:00:18,408
to understand; for they know not

16
00:00:18,408 --> 00:00:18,452
concerning the manner of prophesying among the Jews.

17
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:18,852
2 For I, Nephi, have not taught

18
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:19,252
them many things concerning the

19
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:19,652
manner of the Jews; for their works

20
00:00:19,652 --> 00:00:20,052
were works of darkness, and

21
00:00:20,052 --> 00:00:20,387
their doings were doings of abominations.

22
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:21,53
3 Wherefore, I write unto my

23
00:00:21,53 --> 00:00:22,673
people, unto all those that shall

24
00:00:22,673 --> 00:00:23,816
receive hereafter these things

25
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:24,959
which I write, that they may know

26
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:26,102
the judgments of God, that they

27
00:00:26,102 --> 00:00:27,245
come upon all nations, according

28
00:00:27,245 --> 00:00:28,362
to the word which he hath spoken.

29
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:29,068
4 Wherefore, hearken, O my

30
00:00:29,068 --> 00:00:29,774
people, which are of the house of

31
00:00:29,774 --> 00:00:30,48
Israel, and give ear unto my

32
00:00:30,48 --> 00:00:31,186
words; for because the words of

33
00:00:31,186 --> 00:00:31,892
Isaiah are not plain unto you,

34
00:00:31,892 --> 00:00:32,598
nevertheless they are plain unto

35
00:00:32,598 --> 00:00:33,304
all those that are filled with

36
00:00:33,304 --> 00:00:34,01
the spirit of prophecy. But I

37
00:00:34,01 --> 00:00:34,716
give unto you a prophecy,

38
00:00:34,716 --> 00:00:35,422
according to the spirit which is in

39
00:00:35,422 --> 00:00:36,128
me; wherefore I shall prophesy

40
00:00:36,128 --> 00:00:36,834
according to the plainness which

41
00:00:36,834 --> 00:00:37,54
hath been with me from the

42
00:00:37,54 --> 00:00:38,246
time that I came out from

43
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:38,952
Jerusalem with my father; for behold,

44
00:00:38,952 --> 00:00:39,658
my soul delighteth in plainness

45
00:00:39,658 --> 00:00:40,24
unto my people, that they may learn.

46
00:00:40,24 --> 00:00:40,625
5 Yea, and my soul delighteth

47
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:41,01
in the words of Isaiah, for

48
00:00:41,01 --> 00:00:41,395
I came out from Jerusalem,

49
00:00:41,395 --> 00:00:41,78
and mine eyes hath beheld the

50
00:00:41,78 --> 00:00:42,165
things of the Jews, and I know

51
00:00:42,165 --> 00:00:42,55
that the Jews do understand

52
00:00:42,55 --> 00:00:42,935
the things of the prophets,

53
00:00:42,935 --> 00:00:43,32
and there is none other people

54
00:00:43,32 --> 00:00:43,705
that understand the things

55
00:00:43,705 --> 00:00:44,09
which were spoken unto the

56
00:00:44,09 --> 00:00:44,475
Jews like unto them, save it be

57
00:00:44,475 --> 00:00:44,86
that they are taught after

58
00:00:44,86 --> 00:00:45,646
the manner of the things of the Jews.

59
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:45,932
6 But behold, I, Nephi,

60
00:00:45,932 --> 00:00:46,218
have not taught my children

61
00:00:46,218 --> 00:00:46,504
after the manner of the Jews;

62
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:46,79
but behold, I, of myself,

63
00:00:46,79 --> 00:00:47,076
have dwelt at Jerusalem,

64
00:00:47,076 --> 00:00:47,362
wherefore I know concerning

65
00:00:47,362 --> 00:00:47,648
the regions round about; and

66
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:47,934
I have made mention unto

67
00:00:47,934 --> 00:00:48,22
my children concerning the

68
00:00:48,22 --> 00:00:48,506
judgments of God, which hath

69
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:48,792
come to pass among the

70
00:00:48,792 --> 00:00:49,078
Jews, unto my children,

71
00:00:49,078 --> 00:00:49,364
according to all that which

72
00:00:49,364 --> 00:00:49,116
Isaiah hath spoken, and I do not write them.

73
00:00:49,116 --> 00:00:50,316
7 But behold, I proceed

74
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:51,516
with mine own prophecy,

75
00:00:51,516 --> 00:00:52,716
according to my plainness; in

76
00:00:52,716 --> 00:00:53,916
the which I know that no

77
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:55,116
man can err; nevertheless,

78
00:00:55,116 --> 00:00:56,316
in the days that the

79
00:00:56,316 --> 00:00:57,516
prophecies of Isaiah shall be

80
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:58,716
fulfilled men shall know of

81
00:00:58,716 --> 00:00:59,916
a surety, at the times

82
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:01,495
when they shall come to pass.

83
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:02,781
8 Wherefore, they are of

84
00:01:02,781 --> 00:01:04,067
worth unto the children

85
00:01:04,067 --> 00:01:05,353
of men, and he that

86
00:01:05,353 --> 00:01:06,639
supposeth that they are

87
00:01:06,639 --> 00:01:07,925
not, unto them will I speak

88
00:01:07,925 --> 00:01:09,211
particularly, and

89
00:01:09,211 --> 00:01:10,497
confine the words unto mine

90
00:01:10,497 --> 00:01:11,783
own people; for I know

91
00:01:11,783 --> 00:01:13,069
that they shall be of

92
00:01:13,069 --> 00:01:14,355
great worth unto them in the

93
00:01:14,355 --> 00:01:15,641
last days; for in that

94
00:01:15,641 --> 00:01:16,927
day shall they

95
00:01:16,927 --> 00:01:18,213
understand them; wherefore, for

96
00:01:18,213 --> 00:01:19,379
their good have I written them.

97
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:19,296
9 And as one

98
00:01:19,296 --> 00:01:19,213
generation hath been destroyed

99
00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:19,13
among the Jews because

100
00:01:19,13 --> 00:01:19,047
of iniquity, even so

101
00:01:19,047 --> 00:01:18,964
have they been

102
00:01:18,964 --> 00:01:18,881
destroyed from generation to

103
00:01:18,881 --> 00:01:18,798
generation according

104
00:01:18,798 --> 00:01:18,715
to their iniquities;

105
00:01:18,715 --> 00:01:18,632
and never hath any of

106
00:01:18,632 --> 00:01:18,549
them been destroyed save

107
00:01:18,549 --> 00:01:18,466
it were foretold them

108
00:01:18,466 --> 00:01:18,445
by the prophets of the Lord.

109
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:18,588
10 Wherefore, it hath

110
00:01:18,588 --> 00:01:18,731
been told them

111
00:01:18,731 --> 00:01:18,874
concerning the destruction

112
00:01:18,874 --> 00:01:19,017
which should come

113
00:01:19,017 --> 00:01:19,16
upon them, immediately

114
00:01:19,16 --> 00:01:19,303
after my father left

115
00:01:19,303 --> 00:01:19,446
Jerusalem;

116
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:19,589
nevertheless, they hardened

117
00:01:19,589 --> 00:01:19,732
their hearts; and

118
00:01:19,732 --> 00:01:19,875
according to my prophecy

119
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:20,018
they have been

120
00:01:20,018 --> 00:01:20,161
destroyed, save it be those

121
00:01:20,161 --> 00:01:20,304
which are carried away

122
00:01:20,304 --> 00:01:20,38
captive into Babylon.

123
00:01:20,38 --> 00:01:20,63
11 And now this I

124
00:01:20,63 --> 00:01:20,88
speak because of the

125
00:01:20,88 --> 00:01:21,13
spirit which is in

126
00:01:21,13 --> 00:01:21,38
me. And

127
00:01:21,38 --> 00:01:21,63
notwithstanding they have been

128
00:01:21,63 --> 00:01:21,88
carried away they shall

129
00:01:21,88 --> 00:01:22,13
return again, and

130
00:01:22,13 --> 00:01:22,38
possess the land of

131
00:01:22,38 --> 00:01:22,63
Jerusalem; wherefore,

132
00:01:22,63 --> 00:01:22,88
they shall be

133
00:01:22,88 --> 00:01:23,13
restored again to the

134
00:01:23,13 --> 00:01:23,85
land of their inheritance.

135
00:01:23,85 --> 00:01:23,968
12 But, behold,

136
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,086
they shall have wars,

137
00:01:24,086 --> 00:01:24,204
and rumors of wars;

138
00:01:24,204 --> 00:01:24,322
and when the day

139
00:01:24,322 --> 00:01:24,44
cometh that the Only

140
00:01:24,44 --> 00:01:24,558
Begotten of the

141
00:01:24,558 --> 00:01:24,676
Father, yea, even the

142
00:01:24,676 --> 00:01:24,794
Father of heaven

143
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:24,912
and of earth, shall

144
00:01:24,912 --> 00:01:25,03
manifest himself

145
00:01:25,03 --> 00:01:25,148
unto them in the

146
00:01:25,148 --> 00:01:25,266
flesh, behold, they

147
00:01:25,266 --> 00:01:25,384
will reject him,

148
00:01:25,384 --> 00:01:25,502
because of their

149
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:25,62
iniquities, and the

150
00:01:25,62 --> 00:01:25,738
hardness of their hearts,

151
00:01:25,738 --> 00:01:25,786
and the stiffness of their necks.

152
00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:25,733
13 Behold, they

153
00:01:25,733 --> 00:01:25,68
will crucify him;

154
00:01:25,68 --> 00:01:25,627
and after he is laid

155
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:25,574
in a sepulchre

156
00:01:25,574 --> 00:01:25,521
for the space of

157
00:01:25,521 --> 00:01:25,468
three days he shall

158
00:01:25,468 --> 00:01:25,415
rise from the dead,

159
00:01:25,415 --> 00:01:25,362
with healing in

160
00:01:25,362 --> 00:01:25,309
his wings; and all

161
00:01:25,309 --> 00:01:25,256
those who shall

162
00:01:25,256 --> 00:01:25,203
believe on his name

163
00:01:25,203 --> 00:01:25,15
shall be saved in

164
00:01:25,15 --> 00:01:25,097
the kingdom of

165
00:01:25,097 --> 00:01:25,044
God. Wherefore, my

166
00:01:25,044 --> 00:01:24,991
soul delighteth to

167
00:01:24,991 --> 00:01:24,938
prophesy concerning

168
00:01:24,938 --> 00:01:24,885
him, for I have

169
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:24,832
seen his day, and

170
00:01:24,832 --> 00:01:24,851
my heart doth magnify his holy name.

171
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:24,789
14 And behold it

172
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:24,727
shall come to

173
00:01:24,727 --> 00:01:24,665
pass that after the

174
00:01:24,665 --> 00:01:24,603
Messiah hath

175
00:01:24,603 --> 00:01:24,541
risen from the dead,

176
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:24,479
and hath

177
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:24,417
manifested himself unto

178
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:24,355
his people, unto

179
00:01:24,355 --> 00:01:24,293
as many as will

180
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:24,231
believe on his

181
00:01:24,231 --> 00:01:24,169
name, behold,

182
00:01:24,169 --> 00:01:24,107
Jerusalem shall be

183
00:01:24,107 --> 00:01:24,045
destroyed again; for

184
00:01:24,045 --> 00:01:23,983
wo unto them that

185
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:23,921
fight against God

186
00:01:23,921 --> 00:01:23,917
and the people of his church.

187
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:23,817
15 Wherefore,

188
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:23,717
the Jews shall

189
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:23,617
be scattered

190
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:23,517
among all nations;

191
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:23,417
yea, and also

192
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:23,317
Babylon shall

193
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:23,217
be destroyed;

194
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:23,117
wherefore, the

195
00:01:23,117 --> 00:01:23,017
Jews shall be

196
00:01:23,017 --> 00:01:22,983
scattered by other nations.

197
00:01:22,983 --> 00:01:23,108
16 And after

198
00:01:23,108 --> 00:01:23,233
they have been

199
00:01:23,233 --> 00:01:23,358
scattered, and

200
00:01:23,358 --> 00:01:23,483
the Lord God

201
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:23,608
hath scourged

202
00:01:23,608 --> 00:01:23,733
them by other

203
00:01:23,733 --> 00:01:23,858
nations for

204
00:01:23,858 --> 00:01:23,983
the space of

205
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:24,108
many generations,

206
00:01:24,108 --> 00:01:24,233
yea, even

207
00:01:24,233 --> 00:01:24,358
down from

208
00:01:24,358 --> 00:01:24,483
generation to

209
00:01:24,483 --> 00:01:24,608
generation until they

210
00:01:24,608 --> 00:01:24,733
shall be

211
00:01:24,733 --> 00:01:24,858
persuaded to

212
00:01:24,858 --> 00:01:24,983
believe in Christ,

213
00:01:24,983 --> 00:01:25,108
the Son of

214
00:01:25,108 --> 00:01:25,233
God, and the

215
00:01:25,233 --> 00:01:25,358
atonement, which

216
00:01:25,358 --> 00:01:25,483
is infinite for

217
00:01:25,483 --> 00:01:25,608
all

218
00:01:25,608 --> 00:01:25,733
mankind—and when that

219
00:01:25,733 --> 00:01:25,858
day shall come

220
00:01:25,858 --> 00:01:25,983
that they

221
00:01:25,983 --> 00:01:26,108
shall believe in

222
00:01:26,108 --> 00:01:26,233
Christ, and

223
00:01:26,233 --> 00:01:26,358
worship the

224
00:01:26,358 --> 00:01:26,483
Father in his name,

225
00:01:26,483 --> 00:01:26,608
with pure

226
00:01:26,608 --> 00:01:26,733
hearts and clean

227
00:01:26,733 --> 00:01:26,858
hands, and

228
00:01:26,858 --> 00:01:26,983
look not forward

229
00:01:26,983 --> 00:01:27,108
any more for

230
00:01:27,108 --> 00:01:27,233
another

231
00:01:27,233 --> 00:01:27,358
Messiah, then, at

232
00:01:27,358 --> 00:01:27,483
that time, the

233
00:01:27,483 --> 00:01:27,608
day will come

234
00:01:27,608 --> 00:01:27,733
that it must

235
00:01:27,733 --> 00:01:27,858
needs be

236
00:01:27,858 --> 00:01:27,387
expedient that they should believe these things.

237
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:28,52
17 And the

238
00:01:28,52 --> 00:01:29,653
Lord will set

239
00:01:29,653 --> 00:01:30,786
his hand again

240
00:01:30,786 --> 00:01:31,919
the second

241
00:01:31,919 --> 00:01:33,052
time to

242
00:01:33,052 --> 00:01:34,185
restore his people

243
00:01:34,185 --> 00:01:35,318
from their

244
00:01:35,318 --> 00:01:36,451
lost and fallen

245
00:01:36,451 --> 00:01:37,584
state.

246
00:01:37,584 --> 00:01:38,717
Wherefore, he will

247
00:01:38,717 --> 00:01:39,85
proceed to

248
00:01:39,85 --> 00:01:40,983
do a marvelous

249
00:01:40,983 --> 00:01:42,116
work and a

250
00:01:42,116 --> 00:01:43,249
wonder among

251
00:01:43,249 --> 00:01:44,304
the children of men.

252
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:44,841
18

253
00:01:44,841 --> 00:01:45,378
Wherefore, he shall

254
00:01:45,378 --> 00:01:45,915
bring forth

255
00:01:45,915 --> 00:01:46,452
his words

256
00:01:46,452 --> 00:01:46,989
unto them,

257
00:01:46,989 --> 00:01:47,526
which words

258
00:01:47,526 --> 00:01:48,063
shall judge them

259
00:01:48,063 --> 00:01:48,6
at the last

260
00:01:48,6 --> 00:01:49,137
day, for

261
00:01:49,137 --> 00:01:49,674
they shall be

262
00:01:49,674 --> 00:01:50,211
given them

263
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:50,748
for the

264
00:01:50,748 --> 00:01:51,285
purpose of

265
00:01:51,285 --> 00:01:51,822
convincing them of

266
00:01:51,822 --> 00:01:52,359
the true

267
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:52,896
Messiah, who

268
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,433
was rejected

269
00:01:53,433 --> 00:01:53,97
by them; and

270
00:01:53,97 --> 00:01:54,507
unto the

271
00:01:54,507 --> 00:01:55,044
convincing of

272
00:01:55,044 --> 00:01:55,581
them that

273
00:01:55,581 --> 00:01:56,118
they need not

274
00:01:56,118 --> 00:01:56,655
look forward

275
00:01:56,655 --> 00:01:57,192
any more

276
00:01:57,192 --> 00:01:57,729
for a Messiah

277
00:01:57,729 --> 00:01:58,266
to come, for

278
00:01:58,266 --> 00:01:58,803
there

279
00:01:58,803 --> 00:01:59,34
should not any

280
00:01:59,34 --> 00:01:59,877
come, save it

281
00:01:59,877 --> 00:02:00,414
should be a

282
00:02:00,414 --> 00:02:00,951
false

283
00:02:00,951 --> 00:02:01,488
Messiah which

284
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:02,025
should deceive

285
00:02:02,025 --> 00:02:02,562
the people;

286
00:02:02,562 --> 00:02:03,099
for there is

287
00:02:03,099 --> 00:02:03,636
save one

288
00:02:03,636 --> 00:02:04,173
Messiah spoken

289
00:02:04,173 --> 00:02:04,71
of by the

290
00:02:04,71 --> 00:02:05,247
prophets, and

291
00:02:05,247 --> 00:02:05,784
that Messiah

292
00:02:05,784 --> 00:02:06,093
is he who should be rejected of the Jews.

293
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:06,411
19 For

294
00:02:06,411 --> 00:02:06,729
according to

295
00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:07,047
the words of

296
00:02:07,047 --> 00:02:07,365
the

297
00:02:07,365 --> 00:02:07,683
prophets, the

298
00:02:07,683 --> 00:02:08,001
Messiah cometh

299
00:02:08,001 --> 00:02:08,319
in six

300
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:08,637
hundred years

301
00:02:08,637 --> 00:02:08,955
from the

302
00:02:08,955 --> 00:02:09,273
time that my

303
00:02:09,273 --> 00:02:09,591
father left

304
00:02:09,591 --> 00:02:09,909
Jerusalem;

305
00:02:09,909 --> 00:02:10,227
and

306
00:02:10,227 --> 00:02:10,545
according to the

307
00:02:10,545 --> 00:02:10,863
words of the

308
00:02:10,863 --> 00:02:11,181
prophets,

309
00:02:11,181 --> 00:02:11,499
and also

310
00:02:11,499 --> 00:02:11,817
the word of

311
00:02:11,817 --> 00:02:12,135
the angel of

312
00:02:12,135 --> 00:02:12,453
God, his

313
00:02:12,453 --> 00:02:12,771
name shall

314
00:02:12,771 --> 00:02:13,567
be Jesus Christ, the Son of God.

315
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:13,705
20 And

316
00:02:13,705 --> 00:02:13,843
now, my

317
00:02:13,843 --> 00:02:13,981
brethren, I

318
00:02:13,981 --> 00:02:14,119
have spoken

319
00:02:14,119 --> 00:02:14,257
plainly

320
00:02:14,257 --> 00:02:14,395
that ye

321
00:02:14,395 --> 00:02:14,533
cannot err. And

322
00:02:14,533 --> 00:02:14,671
as the

323
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:14,809
Lord God

324
00:02:14,809 --> 00:02:14,947
liveth that

325
00:02:14,947 --> 00:02:15,085
brought

326
00:02:15,085 --> 00:02:15,223
Israel up out

327
00:02:15,223 --> 00:02:15,361
of the

328
00:02:15,361 --> 00:02:15,499
land of

329
00:02:15,499 --> 00:02:15,637
Egypt, and

330
00:02:15,637 --> 00:02:15,775
gave unto

331
00:02:15,775 --> 00:02:15,913
Moses power

332
00:02:15,913 --> 00:02:16,051
that he

333
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:16,189
should heal

334
00:02:16,189 --> 00:02:16,327
the nations

335
00:02:16,327 --> 00:02:16,465
after

336
00:02:16,465 --> 00:02:16,603
they had been

337
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:16,741
bitten by

338
00:02:16,741 --> 00:02:16,879
the

339
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:17,017
poisonous

340
00:02:17,017 --> 00:02:17,155
serpents, if

341
00:02:17,155 --> 00:02:17,293
they would

342
00:02:17,293 --> 00:02:17,431
cast their

343
00:02:17,431 --> 00:02:17,569
eyes unto

344
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:17,707
the

345
00:02:17,707 --> 00:02:17,845
serpent which he

346
00:02:17,845 --> 00:02:17,983
did raise

347
00:02:17,983 --> 00:02:18,121
up before

348
00:02:18,121 --> 00:02:18,259
them, and

349
00:02:18,259 --> 00:02:18,397
also gave

350
00:02:18,397 --> 00:02:18,535
him power

351
00:02:18,535 --> 00:02:18,673
that he

352
00:02:18,673 --> 00:02:18,811
should

353
00:02:18,811 --> 00:02:18,949
smite the rock

354
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:19,087
and the

355
00:02:19,087 --> 00:02:19,225
water

356
00:02:19,225 --> 00:02:19,363
should come

357
00:02:19,363 --> 00:02:19,501
forth; yea,

358
00:02:19,501 --> 00:02:19,639
behold I

359
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:19,777
say unto

360
00:02:19,777 --> 00:02:19,915
you, that as

361
00:02:19,915 --> 00:02:20,053
these

362
00:02:20,053 --> 00:02:20,191
things are

363
00:02:20,191 --> 00:02:20,329
true, and as

364
00:02:20,329 --> 00:02:20,467
the Lord

365
00:02:20,467 --> 00:02:20,605
God liveth,

366
00:02:20,605 --> 00:02:20,743
there is

367
00:02:20,743 --> 00:02:20,881
none other

368
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:21,019
name

369
00:02:21,019 --> 00:02:21,157
given under

370
00:02:21,157 --> 00:02:21,295
heaven save

371
00:02:21,295 --> 00:02:21,433
it be this

372
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:21,541
Jesus Christ, of which I have spoken, whereby man can be saved.

373
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:21,767
21

374
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:21,993
Wherefore, for

375
00:02:21,993 --> 00:02:22,219
this

376
00:02:22,219 --> 00:02:22,445
cause hath

377
00:02:22,445 --> 00:02:22,671
the Lord

378
00:02:22,671 --> 00:02:22,897
God

379
00:02:22,897 --> 00:02:23,123
promised unto me

380
00:02:23,123 --> 00:02:23,349
that

381
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:23,575
these things

382
00:02:23,575 --> 00:02:23,801
which I

383
00:02:23,801 --> 00:02:24,027
write

384
00:02:24,027 --> 00:02:24,253
shall be

385
00:02:24,253 --> 00:02:24,479
kept and

386
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:24,705
preserved,

387
00:02:24,705 --> 00:02:24,931
and handed

388
00:02:24,931 --> 00:02:25,157
down

389
00:02:25,157 --> 00:02:25,383
unto my

390
00:02:25,383 --> 00:02:25,609
seed, from

391
00:02:25,609 --> 00:02:25,835
generation

392
00:02:25,835 --> 00:02:26,061
to

393
00:02:26,061 --> 00:02:26,287
generation,

394
00:02:26,287 --> 00:02:26,513
that the

395
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:26,739
promise may

396
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:26,965
be

397
00:02:26,965 --> 00:02:27,191
fulfilled unto

398
00:02:27,191 --> 00:02:27,417
Joseph,

399
00:02:27,417 --> 00:02:27,643
that his

400
00:02:27,643 --> 00:02:27,869
seed

401
00:02:27,869 --> 00:02:28,095
should never

402
00:02:28,095 --> 00:02:28,321
perish as
