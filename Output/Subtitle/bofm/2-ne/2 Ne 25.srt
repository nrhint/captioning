00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,778
Chapter 25 Nephi glories in plainness—Isaiah’s

2
00:00:00,778 --> 00:00:01,556
 prophecies will be understood in the last days—The

3
00:00:01,556 --> 00:00:02,334
 Jews will return from Babylon, crucify the Messiah,

4
00:00:02,334 --> 00:00:03,112
 and be scattered and scourged—They will be

5
00:00:03,112 --> 00:00:03,89
 restored when they believe in the Messiah—He will first

6
00:00:03,89 --> 00:00:04,668
 come six hundred years after Lehi left

7
00:00:04,668 --> 00:00:05,446
 Jerusalem—The Nephites keep the law of Moses and believe in

8
00:00:05,446 --> 00:00:06,224
 Christ, who is the Holy One of Israel. About

9
00:00:06,224 --> 00:00:07,002
 559–545 B.C.

10
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,308
1 Now I, Nephi, do speak somewhat concerning the

11
00:00:09,308 --> 00:00:10,641
 words which I have written, which have been spoken

12
00:00:10,641 --> 00:00:11,974
 by the mouth of Isaiah. For behold, Isaiah spake

13
00:00:11,974 --> 00:00:13,307
 many things which were hard for many of my people

14
00:00:13,307 --> 00:00:14,64
 to understand; for they know not concerning the

15
00:00:14,64 --> 00:00:15,973
 manner of prophesying among the Jews

16
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,949
2 For I, Nephi, have not taught them many things

17
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:19,949
 concerning the manner of the Jews; for their works

18
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:21,949
 were works of darkness, and their doings were

19
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:23,949
 doings of abominations

20
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,524
3 Wherefore, I write unto my people, unto all

21
00:00:25,524 --> 00:00:27,124
 those that shall receive hereafter these things which

22
00:00:27,124 --> 00:00:28,724
 I write, that they may know the judgments of God,

23
00:00:28,724 --> 00:00:30,324
 that they come upon all nations, according to the

24
00:00:30,324 --> 00:00:31,924
 word which he hath spoken

25
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:32,626
4 Wherefore, hearken, O my people, which are of

26
00:00:32,626 --> 00:00:33,353
 the house of Israel, and give ear unto my words; for

27
00:00:33,353 --> 00:00:34,08
 because the words of Isaiah are not plain unto

28
00:00:34,08 --> 00:00:34,807
 you, nevertheless they are plain unto all those that

29
00:00:34,807 --> 00:00:35,534
 are filled with the spirit of prophecy. But I

30
00:00:35,534 --> 00:00:36,261
 give unto you a prophecy, according to the spirit

31
00:00:36,261 --> 00:00:36,988
 which is in me; wherefore I shall prophesy according

32
00:00:36,988 --> 00:00:37,715
 to the plainness which hath been with me from the

33
00:00:37,715 --> 00:00:38,442
 time that I came out from Jerusalem with my

34
00:00:38,442 --> 00:00:39,169
 father; for behold, my soul delighteth in plainness unto

35
00:00:39,169 --> 00:00:39,896
 my people, that they may learn

36
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:40,873
5 Yea, and my soul delighteth in the words of

37
00:00:40,873 --> 00:00:41,873
 Isaiah, for I came out from Jerusalem, and mine eyes

38
00:00:41,873 --> 00:00:42,873
 hath beheld the things of the Jews, and I know that

39
00:00:42,873 --> 00:00:43,873
 the Jews do understand the things of the

40
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:44,873
 prophets, and there is none other people that understand

41
00:00:44,873 --> 00:00:45,873
 the things which were spoken unto the Jews like

42
00:00:45,873 --> 00:00:46,873
 unto them, save it be that they are taught after the

43
00:00:46,873 --> 00:00:47,873
 manner of the things of the Jews

44
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:48,848
6 But behold, I, Nephi, have not taught my

45
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:49,848
 children after the manner of the Jews; but behold, I, of

46
00:00:49,848 --> 00:00:50,848
 myself, have dwelt at Jerusalem, wherefore I know

47
00:00:50,848 --> 00:00:51,848
 concerning the regions round about; and I have

48
00:00:51,848 --> 00:00:52,848
 made mention unto my children concerning the

49
00:00:52,848 --> 00:00:53,848
 judgments of God, which hath come to pass among the Jews,

50
00:00:53,848 --> 00:00:54,848
 unto my children, according to all that which

51
00:00:54,848 --> 00:00:55,848
 Isaiah hath spoken, and I do not write them

52
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,155
7 But behold, I proceed with mine own prophecy,

53
00:00:57,155 --> 00:00:58,488
 according to my plainness; in the which I know that

54
00:00:58,488 --> 00:00:59,821
 no man can err; nevertheless, in the days that the

55
00:00:59,821 --> 00:01:01,154
 prophecies of Isaiah shall be fulfilled men shall

56
00:01:01,154 --> 00:01:02,487
 know of a surety, at the times when they shall

57
00:01:02,487 --> 00:01:03,82
 come to pass

58
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:04,94
8 Wherefore, they are of worth unto the children

59
00:01:04,94 --> 00:01:06,083
 of men, and he that supposeth that they are not,

60
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:07,226
 unto them will I speak particularly, and confine the

61
00:01:07,226 --> 00:01:08,369
 words unto mine own people; for I know that they

62
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:09,512
 shall be of great worth unto them in the last

63
00:01:09,512 --> 00:01:10,655
 days; for in that day shall they understand them;

64
00:01:10,655 --> 00:01:11,798
 wherefore, for their good have I written them

65
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:13,105
9 And as one generation hath been destroyed among

66
00:01:13,105 --> 00:01:14,438
 the Jews because of iniquity, even so have they

67
00:01:14,438 --> 00:01:15,771
 been destroyed from generation to generation

68
00:01:15,771 --> 00:01:17,104
 according to their iniquities; and never hath any of them

69
00:01:17,104 --> 00:01:18,437
 been destroyed save it were foretold them by the

70
00:01:18,437 --> 00:01:19,77
 prophets of the Lord

71
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,079
10 Wherefore, it hath been told them concerning

72
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:22,412
 the destruction which should come upon them,

73
00:01:22,412 --> 00:01:23,745
 immediately after my father left Jerusalem; nevertheless,

74
00:01:23,745 --> 00:01:25,078
 they hardened their hearts; and according to my

75
00:01:25,078 --> 00:01:26,411
 prophecy they have been destroyed, save it be those

76
00:01:26,411 --> 00:01:27,744
 which are carried away captive into Babylon

77
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:59,721
11 And now this I speak because of the spirit

78
00:01:59,721 --> 00:02:31,721
 which is in me. And notwithstanding they have been

79
00:02:31,721 --> 00:03:03,721
 carried away they shall return again, and possess the

80
00:03:03,721 --> 00:03:35,721
 land of Jerusalem; wherefore, they shall be

81
00:03:35,721 --> 00:04:07,721
 restored again to the land of their inheritance

82
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:21,928
12 But, behold, they shall have wars, and rumors

83
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:36,642
 of wars; and when the day cometh that the Only

84
00:04:36,642 --> 00:04:51,356
 Begotten of the Father, yea, even the Father of heaven

85
00:04:51,356 --> 00:05:06,07
 and of earth, shall manifest himself unto them in

86
00:05:06,07 --> 00:05:20,784
 the flesh, behold, they will reject him, because

87
00:05:20,784 --> 00:05:35,498
 of their iniquities, and the hardness of their

88
00:05:35,498 --> 00:05:50,212
 hearts, and the stiffness of their necks

89
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,975
15 Wherefore, the Jews shall be scattered among

90
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:11,975
 all nations; yea, and also Babylon shall be

91
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:13,975
 destroyed; wherefore, the Jews shall be scattered by other

92
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:15,975
 nations

93
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:16,616
16 And after they have been scattered, and the

94
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:17,283
 Lord God hath scourged them by other nations for the

95
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:17,95
 space of many generations, yea, even down from

96
00:00:17,95 --> 00:00:18,617
 generation to generation until they shall be

97
00:00:18,617 --> 00:00:19,284
 persuaded to believe in Christ, the Son of God, and the

98
00:00:19,284 --> 00:00:19,951
 atonement, which is infinite for all mankind—and

99
00:00:19,951 --> 00:00:20,618
 when that day shall come that they shall believe in

100
00:00:20,618 --> 00:00:21,285
 Christ, and worship the Father in his name, with

101
00:00:21,285 --> 00:00:21,952
 pure hearts and clean hands, and look not forward

102
00:00:21,952 --> 00:00:22,619
 any more for another Messiah, then, at that time,

103
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:23,286
 the day will come that it must needs be expedient

104
00:00:23,286 --> 00:00:23,953
 that they should believe these things

105
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,524
17 And the Lord will set his hand again the second

106
00:00:25,524 --> 00:00:27,124
 time to restore his people from their lost and

107
00:00:27,124 --> 00:00:28,724
 fallen state. Wherefore, he will proceed to do a

108
00:00:28,724 --> 00:00:30,324
 marvelous work and a wonder among the children of

109
00:00:30,324 --> 00:00:31,924
 men

110
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:32,626
18 Wherefore, he shall bring forth his words unto

111
00:00:32,626 --> 00:00:33,353
 them, which words shall judge them at the last

112
00:00:33,353 --> 00:00:34,08
 day, for they shall be given them for the purpose of

113
00:00:34,08 --> 00:00:34,807
 convincing them of the true Messiah, who was

114
00:00:34,807 --> 00:00:35,534
 rejected by them; and unto the convincing of them that

115
00:00:35,534 --> 00:00:36,261
 they need not look forward any more for a Messiah

116
00:00:36,261 --> 00:00:36,988
 to come, for there should not any come, save it

117
00:00:36,988 --> 00:00:37,715
 should be a false Messiah which should deceive the

118
00:00:37,715 --> 00:00:38,442
 people; for there is save one Messiah spoken of by

119
00:00:38,442 --> 00:00:39,169
 the prophets, and that Messiah is he who should be

120
00:00:39,169 --> 00:00:39,896
 rejected of the Jews

121
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,206
19 For according to the words of the prophets, the

122
00:00:41,206 --> 00:00:42,539
 Messiah cometh in six hundred years from the time

123
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:43,872
 that my father left Jerusalem; and according to

124
00:00:43,872 --> 00:00:45,205
 the words of the prophets, and also the word of the

125
00:00:45,205 --> 00:00:46,538
 angel of God, his name shall be Jesus Christ, the

126
00:00:46,538 --> 00:00:47,871
 Son of God

127
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:48,463
20 And now, my brethren, I have spoken plainly

128
00:00:48,463 --> 00:00:49,078
 that ye cannot err. And as the Lord God liveth that

129
00:00:49,078 --> 00:00:49,693
 brought Israel up out of the land of Egypt, and

130
00:00:49,693 --> 00:00:50,308
 gave unto Moses power that he should heal the nations

131
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:50,923
 after they had been bitten by the poisonous

132
00:00:50,923 --> 00:00:51,538
 serpents, if they would cast their eyes unto the

133
00:00:51,538 --> 00:00:52,153
 serpent which he did raise up before them, and also gave

134
00:00:52,153 --> 00:00:52,768
 him power that he should smite the rock and the

135
00:00:52,768 --> 00:00:53,383
 water should come forth; yea, behold I say unto

136
00:00:53,383 --> 00:00:53,998
 you, that as these things are true, and as the Lord

137
00:00:53,998 --> 00:00:54,613
 God liveth, there is none other name given under

138
00:00:54,613 --> 00:00:55,228
 heaven save it be this Jesus Christ, of which I have

139
00:00:55,228 --> 00:00:55,843
 spoken, whereby man can be saved

140
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:56,965
21 Wherefore, for this cause hath the Lord God

141
00:00:56,965 --> 00:00:58,108
 promised unto me that these things which I write

142
00:00:58,108 --> 00:00:59,251
 shall be kept and preserved, and handed down unto my

143
00:00:59,251 --> 00:01:00,394
 seed, from generation to generation, that the

144
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:01,537
 promise may be fulfilled unto Joseph, that his seed

145
00:01:01,537 --> 00:01:02,68
 should never perish as long as the earth should

146
00:01:02,68 --> 00:01:03,823
 stand

147
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,13
22 Wherefore, these things shall go from

148
00:01:05,13 --> 00:01:06,463
 generation to generation as long as the earth shall stand;

149
00:01:06,463 --> 00:01:07,796
 and they shall go according to the will and

150
00:01:07,796 --> 00:01:09,129
 pleasure of God; and the nations who shall possess them

151
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:10,462
 shall be judged of them according to the words

152
00:01:10,462 --> 00:01:11,795
 which are written

153
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:13,372
23 For we labor diligently to write, to persuade

154
00:01:13,372 --> 00:01:14,972
 our children, and also our brethren, to believe in

155
00:01:14,972 --> 00:01:16,572
 Christ, and to be reconciled to God; for we know

156
00:01:16,572 --> 00:01:18,172
 that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we

157
00:01:18,172 --> 00:01:19,772
 can do

158
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,746
24 And, notwithstanding we believe in Christ, we

159
00:01:21,746 --> 00:01:23,746
 keep the law of Moses, and look forward with

160
00:01:23,746 --> 00:01:25,746
 steadfastness unto Christ, until the law shall be

161
00:01:25,746 --> 00:01:27,746
 fulfilled

162
00:01:27,721 --> 00:02:07,721
25 For, for this end was the law given; wherefore

163
00:02:07,721 --> 00:02:47,721
 the law hath become dead unto us, and we are made

164
00:02:47,721 --> 00:03:27,721
 alive in Christ because of our faith; yet we keep

165
00:03:27,721 --> 00:04:07,721
 the law because of the commandments

166
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:27,814
26 And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we

167
00:04:27,814 --> 00:04:48,414
 preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we

168
00:04:48,414 --> 00:05:09,014
 write according to our prophecies, that our

169
00:05:09,014 --> 00:05:29,614
 children may know to what source they may look for a

170
00:05:29,614 --> 00:05:50,214
 remission of their sins

171
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,118
29 And now behold, I say unto you that the right

172
00:00:09,118 --> 00:00:10,261
 way is to believe in Christ, and deny him not; and

173
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:11,404
 Christ is the Holy One of Israel; wherefore ye

174
00:00:11,404 --> 00:00:12,547
 must bow down before him, and worship him with all

175
00:00:12,547 --> 00:00:13,69
 your might, mind, and strength, and your whole soul;

176
00:00:13,69 --> 00:00:14,833
 and if ye do this ye shall in nowise be cast out
