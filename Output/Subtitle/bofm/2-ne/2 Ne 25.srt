00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 25 Nephi glories in

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
plainness—Isaiah’s prophecies will be understood in the last

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
days—The Jews will return from Babylon,

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
crucify the Messiah, and be scattered and

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
scourged—They will be restored when they believe in

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Messiah—He will first come six hundred

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
years after Lehi left Jerusalem—The Nephites keep

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the law of Moses and believe in Christ, who

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:04:29,
is the Holy One of Israel. About 559–545 B.C. 

10
00:04:29,0 --> 00:04:29,0
1 Now I, Nephi, do speak somewhat

11
00:04:29,0 --> 00:04:29,0
concerning the words which I have written,

12
00:04:29,0 --> 00:04:29,0
which have been spoken by the mouth of

13
00:04:29,0 --> 00:04:29,0
Isaiah. For behold, Isaiah spake many things

14
00:04:29,0 --> 00:04:29,0
which were hard for many of my people

15
00:04:29,0 --> 00:04:29,0
to understand; for they know not

16
00:04:29,0 --> 00:05:41,
concerning the manner of prophesying among the Jews.

17
00:05:41,0 --> 00:05:41,0
2 For I, Nephi, have not taught

18
00:05:41,0 --> 00:05:41,0
them many things concerning the

19
00:05:41,0 --> 00:05:41,0
manner of the Jews; for their works

20
00:05:41,0 --> 00:05:41,0
were works of darkness, and

21
00:05:41,0 --> 00:17:23,
their doings were doings of abominations.

22
00:17:23,0 --> 00:17:23,0
3 Wherefore, I write unto my

23
00:17:23,0 --> 00:17:23,0
people, unto all those that shall

24
00:17:23,0 --> 00:17:23,0
receive hereafter these things

25
00:17:23,0 --> 00:17:23,0
which I write, that they may know

26
00:17:23,0 --> 00:17:23,0
the judgments of God, that they

27
00:17:23,0 --> 00:17:23,0
come upon all nations, according

28
00:17:23,0 --> 00:17:09,
to the word which he hath spoken.

29
00:17:09,0 --> 00:17:09,0
4 Wherefore, hearken, O my

30
00:17:09,0 --> 00:17:09,0
people, which are of the house of

31
00:17:09,0 --> 00:17:09,0
Israel, and give ear unto my

32
00:17:09,0 --> 00:17:09,0
words; for because the words of

33
00:17:09,0 --> 00:17:09,0
Isaiah are not plain unto you,

34
00:17:09,0 --> 00:17:09,0
nevertheless they are plain unto

35
00:17:09,0 --> 00:17:09,0
all those that are filled with

36
00:17:09,0 --> 00:17:09,0
the spirit of prophecy. But I

37
00:17:09,0 --> 00:17:09,0
give unto you a prophecy,

38
00:17:09,0 --> 00:17:09,0
according to the spirit which is in

39
00:17:09,0 --> 00:17:09,0
me; wherefore I shall prophesy

40
00:17:09,0 --> 00:17:09,0
according to the plainness which

41
00:17:09,0 --> 00:17:09,0
hath been with me from the

42
00:17:09,0 --> 00:17:09,0
time that I came out from

43
00:17:09,0 --> 00:17:09,0
Jerusalem with my father; for behold,

44
00:17:09,0 --> 00:17:09,0
my soul delighteth in plainness

45
00:17:09,0 --> 00:24:38,
unto my people, that they may learn.

46
00:24:38,0 --> 00:24:38,0
5 Yea, and my soul delighteth

47
00:24:38,0 --> 00:24:38,0
in the words of Isaiah, for

48
00:24:38,0 --> 00:24:38,0
I came out from Jerusalem,

49
00:24:38,0 --> 00:24:38,0
and mine eyes hath beheld the

50
00:24:38,0 --> 00:24:38,0
things of the Jews, and I know

51
00:24:38,0 --> 00:24:38,0
that the Jews do understand

52
00:24:38,0 --> 00:24:38,0
the things of the prophets,

53
00:24:38,0 --> 00:24:38,0
and there is none other people

54
00:24:38,0 --> 00:24:38,0
that understand the things

55
00:24:38,0 --> 00:24:38,0
which were spoken unto the

56
00:24:38,0 --> 00:24:38,0
Jews like unto them, save it be

57
00:24:38,0 --> 00:24:38,0
that they are taught after

58
00:24:38,0 --> 00:38:18,
the manner of the things of the Jews.

59
00:38:18,0 --> 00:38:18,0
6 But behold, I, Nephi,

60
00:38:18,0 --> 00:38:18,0
have not taught my children

61
00:38:18,0 --> 00:38:18,0
after the manner of the Jews;

62
00:38:18,0 --> 00:38:18,0
but behold, I, of myself,

63
00:38:18,0 --> 00:38:18,0
have dwelt at Jerusalem,

64
00:38:18,0 --> 00:38:18,0
wherefore I know concerning

65
00:38:18,0 --> 00:38:18,0
the regions round about; and

66
00:38:18,0 --> 00:38:18,0
I have made mention unto

67
00:38:18,0 --> 00:38:18,0
my children concerning the

68
00:38:18,0 --> 00:38:18,0
judgments of God, which hath

69
00:38:18,0 --> 00:38:18,0
come to pass among the

70
00:38:18,0 --> 00:38:18,0
Jews, unto my children,

71
00:38:18,0 --> 00:38:18,0
according to all that which

72
00:38:18,0 --> 00:37:50,
Isaiah hath spoken, and I do not write them.

73
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
7 But behold, I proceed

74
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
with mine own prophecy,

75
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
according to my plainness; in

76
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
the which I know that no

77
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
man can err; nevertheless,

78
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
in the days that the

79
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
prophecies of Isaiah shall be

80
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
fulfilled men shall know of

81
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
a surety, at the times

82
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,
when they shall come to pass.

83
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
8 Wherefore, they are of

84
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
worth unto the children

85
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
of men, and he that

86
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
supposeth that they are

87
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
not, unto them will I speak

88
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
particularly, and

89
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
confine the words unto mine

90
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
own people; for I know

91
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
that they shall be of

92
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
great worth unto them in the

93
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
last days; for in that

94
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
day shall they

95
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
understand them; wherefore, for

96
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,
their good have I written them.

97
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
9 And as one

98
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
generation hath been destroyed

99
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
among the Jews because

100
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
of iniquity, even so

101
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
have they been

102
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
destroyed from generation to

103
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
generation according

104
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
to their iniquities;

105
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
and never hath any of

106
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
them been destroyed save

107
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
it were foretold them

108
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,
by the prophets of the Lord.

109
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
10 Wherefore, it hath

110
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
been told them

111
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
concerning the destruction

112
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
which should come

113
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
upon them, immediately

114
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
after my father left

115
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
Jerusalem;

116
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
nevertheless, they hardened

117
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
their hearts; and

118
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
according to my prophecy

119
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
they have been

120
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
destroyed, save it be those

121
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
which are carried away

122
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,
captive into Babylon.

123
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
11 And now this I

124
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
speak because of the

125
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
spirit which is in

126
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
me. And

127
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
notwithstanding they have been

128
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
carried away they shall

129
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
return again, and

130
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
possess the land of

131
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
Jerusalem; wherefore,

132
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
they shall be

133
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
restored again to the

134
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,
land of their inheritance.

135
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
12 But, behold,

136
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
they shall have wars,

137
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
and rumors of wars;

138
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
and when the day

139
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
cometh that the Only

140
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
Begotten of the

141
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
Father, yea, even the

142
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
Father of heaven

143
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
and of earth, shall

144
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
manifest himself

145
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
unto them in the

146
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
flesh, behold, they

147
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
will reject him,

148
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
because of their

149
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
iniquities, and the

150
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
hardness of their hearts,

151
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,
and the stiffness of their necks.

152
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
13 Behold, they

153
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
will crucify him;

154
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
and after he is laid

155
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
in a sepulchre

156
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
for the space of

157
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
three days he shall

158
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
rise from the dead,

159
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
with healing in

160
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
his wings; and all

161
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
those who shall

162
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
believe on his name

163
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
shall be saved in

164
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
the kingdom of

165
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
God. Wherefore, my

166
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
soul delighteth to

167
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
prophesy concerning

168
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
him, for I have

169
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
seen his day, and

170
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,
my heart doth magnify his holy name.

171
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
14 And behold it

172
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
shall come to

173
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
pass that after the

174
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
Messiah hath

175
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
risen from the dead,

176
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
and hath

177
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
manifested himself unto

178
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
his people, unto

179
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
as many as will

180
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
believe on his

181
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
name, behold,

182
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
Jerusalem shall be

183
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
destroyed again; for

184
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
wo unto them that

185
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
fight against God

186
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,
and the people of his church.

187
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
15 Wherefore,

188
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
the Jews shall

189
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
be scattered

190
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
among all nations;

191
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
yea, and also

192
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
Babylon shall

193
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
be destroyed;

194
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
wherefore, the

195
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
Jews shall be

196
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,
scattered by other nations.

197
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
16 And after

198
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
they have been

199
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
scattered, and

200
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
the Lord God

201
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
hath scourged

202
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
them by other

203
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
nations for

204
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
the space of

205
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
many generations,

206
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
yea, even

207
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
down from

208
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
generation to

209
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
generation until they

210
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
shall be

211
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
persuaded to

212
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
believe in Christ,

213
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
the Son of

214
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
God, and the

215
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
atonement, which

216
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
is infinite for

217
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
all

218
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
mankind—and when that

219
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
day shall come

220
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
that they

221
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
shall believe in

222
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
Christ, and

223
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
worship the

224
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
Father in his name,

225
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
with pure

226
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
hearts and clean

227
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
hands, and

228
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
look not forward

229
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
any more for

230
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
another

231
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
Messiah, then, at

232
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
that time, the

233
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
day will come

234
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
that it must

235
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
needs be

236
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,
expedient that they should believe these things.

237
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
17 And the

238
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
Lord will set

239
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
his hand again

240
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
the second

241
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
time to

242
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
restore his people

243
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
from their

244
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
lost and fallen

245
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
state.

246
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
Wherefore, he will

247
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
proceed to

248
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
do a marvelous

249
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
work and a

250
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
wonder among

251
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,
the children of men.

252
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
18

253
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
Wherefore, he shall

254
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
bring forth

255
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
his words

256
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
unto them,

257
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
which words

258
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
shall judge them

259
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
at the last

260
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
day, for

261
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
they shall be

262
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
given them

263
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
for the

264
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
purpose of

265
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
convincing them of

266
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
the true

267
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
Messiah, who

268
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
was rejected

269
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
by them; and

270
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
unto the

271
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
convincing of

272
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
them that

273
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
they need not

274
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
look forward

275
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
any more

276
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
for a Messiah

277
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
to come, for

278
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
there

279
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
should not any

280
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
come, save it

281
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
should be a

282
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
false

283
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
Messiah which

284
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
should deceive

285
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
the people;

286
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
for there is

287
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
save one

288
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
Messiah spoken

289
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
of by the

290
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
prophets, and

291
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
that Messiah

292
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,
is he who should be rejected of the Jews.

293
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
19 For

294
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
according to

295
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
the words of

296
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
the

297
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
prophets, the

298
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
Messiah cometh

299
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
in six

300
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
hundred years

301
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
from the

302
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
time that my

303
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
father left

304
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
Jerusalem;

305
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
and

306
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
according to the

307
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
words of the

308
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
prophets,

309
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
and also

310
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
the word of

311
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
the angel of

312
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
God, his

313
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
name shall

314
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,
be Jesus Christ, the Son of God.

315
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
20 And

316
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
now, my

317
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
brethren, I

318
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
have spoken

319
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
plainly

320
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
that ye

321
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
cannot err. And

322
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
as the

323
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
Lord God

324
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
liveth that

325
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
brought

326
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
Israel up out

327
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
of the

328
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
land of

329
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
Egypt, and

330
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
gave unto

331
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
Moses power

332
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
that he

333
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
should heal

334
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
the nations

335
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
after

336
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
they had been

337
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
bitten by

338
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
the

339
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
poisonous

340
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
serpents, if

341
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
they would

342
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
cast their

343
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
eyes unto

344
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
the

345
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
serpent which he

346
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
did raise

347
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
up before

348
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
them, and

349
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
also gave

350
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
him power

351
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
that he

352
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
should

353
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
smite the rock

354
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
and the

355
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
water

356
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
should come

357
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
forth; yea,

358
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
behold I

359
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
say unto

360
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
you, that as

361
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
these

362
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
things are

363
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
true, and as

364
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
the Lord

365
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
God liveth,

366
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
there is

367
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
none other

368
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
name

369
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
given under

370
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
heaven save

371
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
it be this

372
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,
Jesus Christ, of which I have spoken, whereby man can be saved.

373
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
21

374
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
Wherefore, for

375
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
this

376
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
cause hath

377
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
the Lord

378
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
God

379
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
promised unto me

380
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
that

381
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
these things

382
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
which I

383
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
write

384
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
shall be

385
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
kept and

386
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
preserved,

387
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
and handed

388
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
down

389
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
unto my

390
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
seed, from

391
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
generation

392
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
to

393
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
generation,

394
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
that the

395
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0

397
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0

398
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
Joseph,

399
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
that his

400
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
seed

401
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
should never

402
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
perish as

404
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
22

405
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
Wherefore,

00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
these

407
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
things shall

408
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
go from

00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
generation as

413
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
long as the

414
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
earth

415
00:37:50,0 --> 00:37:50,0
shall
