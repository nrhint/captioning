00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:05,6
Chapter 2 Redemption comes through the Holy

2
00:00:05,6 --> 00:00:11,2
Messiah—Freedom of choice (agency) is

3
00:00:11,2 --> 00:00:16,8
essential to existence and progression—Adam

4
00:00:16,8 --> 00:00:22,4
fell that men might be—Men are free to choose

5
00:00:22,4 --> 00:00:28,295
liberty and eternal life. About 588–570 B.C. 

6
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:28,128
1 And now, Jacob, I speak unto you:

7
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:27,961
Thou art my firstborn in the days of

8
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:27,794
my tribulation in the wilderness. And

9
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:27,627
behold, in thy childhood thou hast

10
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:27,46
suffered afflictions and much sorrow,

11
00:00:27,46 --> 00:00:27,361
because of the rudeness of thy brethren.

12
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:31,861
2 Nevertheless, Jacob, my firstborn

13
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:36,361
in the wilderness, thou knowest the

14
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:40,861
greatness of God; and he shall

15
00:00:40,861 --> 00:00:45,245
consecrate thine afflictions for thy gain.

16
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:45,134
3 Wherefore, thy soul shall be

17
00:00:45,134 --> 00:00:45,023
blessed, and thou shalt dwell safely

18
00:00:45,023 --> 00:00:44,912
with thy brother, Nephi; and thy days

19
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:44,801
shall be spent in the service of

20
00:00:44,801 --> 00:00:44,69
thy God. Wherefore, I know that thou

21
00:00:44,69 --> 00:00:44,579
art redeemed, because of the

22
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:44,468
righteousness of thy Redeemer; for thou

23
00:00:44,468 --> 00:00:44,357
hast beheld that in the fulness of

24
00:00:44,357 --> 00:00:44,311
time he cometh to bring salvation unto men.

25
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:44,186
4 And thou hast beheld in thy

26
00:00:44,186 --> 00:00:44,061
youth his glory; wherefore, thou

27
00:00:44,061 --> 00:00:43,936
art blessed even as they unto

28
00:00:43,936 --> 00:00:43,811
whom he shall minister in the

29
00:00:43,811 --> 00:00:43,686
flesh; for the Spirit is the same,

30
00:00:43,686 --> 00:00:43,561
yesterday, today, and forever. And

31
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:43,436
the way is prepared from the

32
00:00:43,436 --> 00:00:43,377
fall of man, and salvation is free.

33
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:43,277
5 And men are instructed

34
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:43,177
sufficiently that they know good from

35
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:43,077
evil. And the law is given

36
00:00:43,077 --> 00:00:42,977
unto men. And by the law no flesh

37
00:00:42,977 --> 00:00:42,877
is justified; or, by the law

38
00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:42,777
men are cut off. Yea, by the

39
00:00:42,777 --> 00:00:42,677
temporal law they were cut off; and

40
00:00:42,677 --> 00:00:42,577
also, by the spiritual law

41
00:00:42,577 --> 00:00:42,477
they perish from that which is

42
00:00:42,477 --> 00:00:42,91
good, and become miserable forever.

43
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:43,41
6 Wherefore, redemption

44
00:00:43,41 --> 00:00:43,91
cometh in and through

45
00:00:43,91 --> 00:00:44,41
the Holy Messiah; for he

46
00:00:44,41 --> 00:00:44,378
is full of grace and truth.

47
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:44,267
7 Behold, he offereth

48
00:00:44,267 --> 00:00:44,156
himself a sacrifice

49
00:00:44,156 --> 00:00:44,045
for sin, to answer the

50
00:00:44,045 --> 00:00:43,934
ends of the law, unto

51
00:00:43,934 --> 00:00:43,823
all those who have a

52
00:00:43,823 --> 00:00:43,712
broken heart and a

53
00:00:43,712 --> 00:00:43,601
contrite spirit; and unto

54
00:00:43,601 --> 00:00:43,49
none else can the ends

55
00:00:43,49 --> 00:00:43,443
of the law be answered.

56
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:43,393
8 Wherefore, how great

57
00:00:43,393 --> 00:00:43,343
the importance to

58
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:43,293
make these things known

59
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:43,243
unto the inhabitants of

60
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:43,193
the earth, that they

61
00:00:43,193 --> 00:00:43,143
may know that there is

62
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:43,093
no flesh that can

63
00:00:43,093 --> 00:00:43,043
dwell in the presence of

64
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:42,993
God, save it be

65
00:00:42,993 --> 00:00:42,943
through the merits, and

66
00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:42,893
mercy, and grace of the

67
00:00:42,893 --> 00:00:42,843
Holy Messiah, who layeth

68
00:00:42,843 --> 00:00:42,793
down his life

69
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:42,743
according to the flesh, and

70
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:42,693
taketh it again by the

71
00:00:42,693 --> 00:00:42,643
power of the Spirit,

72
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:42,593
that he may bring to

73
00:00:42,593 --> 00:00:42,543
pass the resurrection of

74
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:42,493
the dead, being the

75
00:00:42,493 --> 00:00:42,976
first that should rise.

76
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:43,351
9 Wherefore, he is

77
00:00:43,351 --> 00:00:43,726
the firstfruits

78
00:00:43,726 --> 00:00:44,101
unto God, inasmuch as

79
00:00:44,101 --> 00:00:44,476
he shall make

80
00:00:44,476 --> 00:00:44,851
intercession for all the

81
00:00:44,851 --> 00:00:45,226
children of men;

82
00:00:45,226 --> 00:00:45,601
and they that

83
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:45,379
believe in him shall be saved.

84
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:45,336
10 And because of

85
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:45,293
the intercession

86
00:00:45,293 --> 00:00:45,25
for all, all men

87
00:00:45,25 --> 00:00:45,207
come unto God;

88
00:00:45,207 --> 00:00:45,164
wherefore, they stand

89
00:00:45,164 --> 00:00:45,121
in the presence of

90
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:45,078
him, to be judged

91
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:45,035
of him according

92
00:00:45,035 --> 00:00:44,992
to the truth and

93
00:00:44,992 --> 00:00:44,949
holiness which is in

94
00:00:44,949 --> 00:00:44,906
him. Wherefore,

95
00:00:44,906 --> 00:00:44,863
the ends of the law

96
00:00:44,863 --> 00:00:44,82
which the Holy

97
00:00:44,82 --> 00:00:44,777
One hath given, unto

98
00:00:44,777 --> 00:00:44,734
the inflicting of

99
00:00:44,734 --> 00:00:44,691
the punishment

100
00:00:44,691 --> 00:00:44,648
which is affixed,

101
00:00:44,648 --> 00:00:44,605
which punishment

102
00:00:44,605 --> 00:00:44,562
that is affixed is in

103
00:00:44,562 --> 00:00:44,519
opposition to

104
00:00:44,519 --> 00:00:44,476
that of the happiness

105
00:00:44,476 --> 00:00:44,433
which is affixed,

106
00:00:44,433 --> 00:00:44,444
to answer the ends of the atonement—

107
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:44,406
11 For it must

108
00:00:44,406 --> 00:00:44,368
needs be, that

109
00:00:44,368 --> 00:00:44,33
there is an

110
00:00:44,33 --> 00:00:44,292
opposition in all things.

111
00:00:44,292 --> 00:00:44,254
If not so, my

112
00:00:44,254 --> 00:00:44,216
firstborn in the

113
00:00:44,216 --> 00:00:44,178
wilderness,

114
00:00:44,178 --> 00:00:44,14
righteousness could not

115
00:00:44,14 --> 00:00:44,102
be brought to

116
00:00:44,102 --> 00:00:44,064
pass, neither

117
00:00:44,064 --> 00:00:44,026
wickedness, neither

118
00:00:44,026 --> 00:00:43,988
holiness nor misery,

119
00:00:43,988 --> 00:00:43,95
neither good nor

120
00:00:43,95 --> 00:00:43,912
bad. Wherefore,

121
00:00:43,912 --> 00:00:43,874
all things must

122
00:00:43,874 --> 00:00:43,836
needs be a compound

123
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:43,798
in one;

124
00:00:43,798 --> 00:00:43,76
wherefore, if it should

125
00:00:43,76 --> 00:00:43,722
be one body it

126
00:00:43,722 --> 00:00:43,684
must needs remain as

127
00:00:43,684 --> 00:00:43,646
dead, having no

128
00:00:43,646 --> 00:00:43,608
life neither

129
00:00:43,608 --> 00:00:43,57
death, nor corruption

130
00:00:43,57 --> 00:00:43,532
nor

131
00:00:43,532 --> 00:00:43,494
incorruption, happiness nor

132
00:00:43,494 --> 00:00:43,51
misery, neither sense nor insensibility.

133
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
12 Wherefore, it

134
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
must needs have

135
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
been created

136
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
for a thing of

137
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
naught; wherefore

138
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
there would have

139
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
been no purpose

140
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
in the end of

141
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
its creation.

142
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
Wherefore, this

143
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
thing must needs

144
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
destroy the wisdom

145
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
of God and his

146
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
eternal purposes,

147
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
and also the

148
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
power, and the

149
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
mercy, and the justice of God.

150
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
13 And if ye

151
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
shall say there

152
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
is no law, ye

153
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
shall also say

154
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
there is no sin.

155
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
If ye shall say

156
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
there is no

157
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
sin, ye shall

158
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
also say there is

159
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
no

160
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
righteousness. And if there

161
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
be no

162
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
righteousness there be

163
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
no happiness.

164
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
And if there be

165
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
no

166
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
righteousness nor happiness

167
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
there be no

168
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
punishment nor

169
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
misery. And if

170
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
these things are

171
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
not there is no

172
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
God. And if

173
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
there is no God

174
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
we are not,

175
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
neither the earth;

176
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
for there could

177
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
have been no

178
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
creation of

179
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
things, neither to

180
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
act nor to be

181
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
acted upon;

182
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
wherefore, all things must have vanished away.

183
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
14 And now, my

184
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
sons, I speak

185
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
unto you

186
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
these things for

187
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
your profit and

188
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
learning; for

189
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
there is a

190
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
God, and he hath

191
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
created all

192
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
things, both

193
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
the heavens and

194
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
the earth, and

195
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
all things

196
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
that in them

197
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
are, both things

198
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
to act and

199
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
things to be acted upon.

200
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
15 And to

201
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
bring about his

202
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
eternal

203
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
purposes in the

204
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
end of man,

205
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
after he had

206
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
created our

207
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
first parents,

208
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
and the beasts

209
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
of the field

210
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
and the fowls

211
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
of the air,

212
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
and in fine,

213
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
all things

214
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
which are

215
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
created, it must

216
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
needs be that

217
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
there was an

218
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
opposition;

219
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
even the

220
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
forbidden fruit in

221
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
opposition

222
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
to the tree of

223
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
life; the

224
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
one being sweet and the other bitter.

225
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
16

226
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
Wherefore, the Lord

227
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
God gave unto

228
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
man that he

229
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
should act

230
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
for himself.

231
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
Wherefore,

232
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
man could

233
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
not act for

234
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
himself save

235
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
it should be

236
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
that he was

237
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
enticed by

238
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
the one or the other.

239
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
17 And I,

240
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
Lehi,

241
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
according to the

242
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
things

243
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
which I have

244
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
read, must

245
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
needs suppose

246
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
that an

247
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
angel of God,

248
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
according

249
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
to that

250
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
which is

251
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
written, had

252
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
fallen from

253
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
heaven;

254
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
wherefore, he

255
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
became a

256
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
devil, having

257
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
sought that

258
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
which was evil before God.

259
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
18 And

260
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
because he

261
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
had fallen

262
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
from

263
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
heaven, and had

264
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
become

265
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
miserable

266
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
forever, he

267
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
sought also

268
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
the

269
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
misery of all

270
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
mankind.

271
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
Wherefore,

272
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
he said

273
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
unto Eve,

274
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
yea, even

275
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
that old

276
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
serpent, who

277
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
is the

278
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
devil, who is

279
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
the father

280
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
of all

281
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
lies,

282
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
wherefore he

283
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
said: Partake

284
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
of the

285
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
forbidden

286
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
fruit, and

287
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
ye shall

288
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
not die, but

289
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
ye shall

290
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
be as God, knowing good and evil.

291
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
19 And

292
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
after Adam

293
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
and Eve

294
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
had

295
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
partaken of the

296
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51


297
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
forbidden fruit

298
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
they were

299
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
driven

300
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
out of the

301
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
garden of

302
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
Eden, to

303
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
till the earth.

304
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
20 And

305
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
they have

306
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
brought

307
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
forth

308
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
children;

309
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
yea,

310
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
even the

311
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
family of

312
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
all the earth.

313
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
21 And

314
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
the

315
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
days of

316
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
the

317
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
children of

318
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
men

319
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
were

320
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
prolonged,

321
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51


322
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
according to

323
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
the will

324
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
of God,

325
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
that

326
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
they

327
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
might

328
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
repent

329
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
while in

330
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
the

331
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
flesh;

332
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
wherefore,

333
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
their

334
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
state

335
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
became a

336
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
state of

337
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51


338
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
probation,

339
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
and their

340
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
time

341
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
was

342
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
lengthened,

343
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51


344
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
according to

345
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
the

346
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51


347
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
commandments

348
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
which the

349
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
Lord God

350
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
gave

351
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
unto the

352
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51


353
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
children of

354
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
men. For

355
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
he

356
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
gave

357
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
commandment

358
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
that

359
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
all men

360
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
must

361
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
repent;

362
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
for he

363
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
showed

364
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
unto all

365
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
men

366
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
that they

367
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
were lost, because of the transgression of their parents.

368
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
22 And

369
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
now,

370
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51


371
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
behold, if

372
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
Adam

373
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
had not

374
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51


375
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
transgressed

376
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
he

377
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
would

378
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
not have

379
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51


380
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
fallen, but

381
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
he

382
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
would

383
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
have

384
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
remained

385
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
in the

386
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51


387
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
garden of

388
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
Eden.

389
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
And all

390
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51


391
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
things

392
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
which were

393
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51


394
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
created

395
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
must have

396
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51


397
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
remained in

398
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
the

399
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
same

400
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
state in

401
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
which

402
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
they

403
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
were

404
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
after

405
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
they

406
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
were

407
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
created;

408
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
and

409
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
they must have remained forever, and had no end.

410
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
23

411
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
And

412
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
they

413
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
would

414
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
have

415
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
had no

416
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51


417
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
children;

418
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51


419
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
wherefore

420
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
they

421
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
would

422
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:43,51
have

423
