Chapter 2 Redemption comes through the Holy

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Messiah—Freedom of choice (agency) is

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
essential to existence and progression—Adam

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
fell that men might be—Men are free to choose

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:17:54,
liberty and eternal life. About 588–570 B.C. 

6
00:17:54,0 --> 00:17:54,0
1 And now, Jacob, I speak unto you:

7
00:17:54,0 --> 00:17:54,0
Thou art my firstborn in the days of

8
00:17:54,0 --> 00:17:54,0
my tribulation in the wilderness. And

9
00:17:54,0 --> 00:17:54,0
behold, in thy childhood thou hast

10
00:17:54,0 --> 00:17:54,0
suffered afflictions and much sorrow,

11
00:17:54,0 --> 00:22:50,
because of the rudeness of thy brethren.

12
00:22:50,0 --> 00:22:50,0
2 Nevertheless, Jacob, my firstborn

13
00:22:50,0 --> 00:22:50,0
in the wilderness, thou knowest the

14
00:22:50,0 --> 00:22:50,0
greatness of God; and he shall

15
00:22:50,0 --> 00:22:22,
consecrate thine afflictions for thy gain.

16
00:22:22,0 --> 00:22:22,0
3 Wherefore, thy soul shall be

17
00:22:22,0 --> 00:22:22,0
blessed, and thou shalt dwell safely

18
00:22:22,0 --> 00:22:22,0
with thy brother, Nephi; and thy days

19
00:22:22,0 --> 00:22:22,0
shall be spent in the service of

20
00:22:22,0 --> 00:22:22,0
thy God. Wherefore, I know that thou

21
00:22:22,0 --> 00:22:22,0
art redeemed, because of the

22
00:22:22,0 --> 00:22:22,0
righteousness of thy Redeemer; for thou

23
00:22:22,0 --> 00:22:22,0
hast beheld that in the fulness of

24
00:22:22,0 --> 00:21:54,
time he cometh to bring salvation unto men.

25
00:21:54,0 --> 00:21:54,0
4 And thou hast beheld in thy

26
00:21:54,0 --> 00:21:54,0
youth his glory; wherefore, thou

27
00:21:54,0 --> 00:21:54,0
art blessed even as they unto

28
00:21:54,0 --> 00:21:54,0
whom he shall minister in the

29
00:21:54,0 --> 00:21:54,0
flesh; for the Spirit is the same,

30
00:21:54,0 --> 00:21:54,0
yesterday, today, and forever. And

31
00:21:54,0 --> 00:21:54,0
the way is prepared from the

32
00:21:54,0 --> 00:22:24,
fall of man, and salvation is free.

33
00:22:24,0 --> 00:22:24,0
5 And men are instructed

34
00:22:24,0 --> 00:22:24,0
sufficiently that they know good from

35
00:22:24,0 --> 00:22:24,0
evil. And the law is given

36
00:22:24,0 --> 00:22:24,0
unto men. And by the law no flesh

37
00:22:24,0 --> 00:22:24,0
is justified; or, by the law

38
00:22:24,0 --> 00:22:24,0
men are cut off. Yea, by the

39
00:22:24,0 --> 00:22:24,0
temporal law they were cut off; and

40
00:22:24,0 --> 00:22:24,0
also, by the spiritual law

41
00:22:24,0 --> 00:22:24,0
they perish from that which is

42
00:22:24,0 --> 00:21:56,
good, and become miserable forever.

43
00:21:56,0 --> 00:21:56,0
6 Wherefore, redemption

44
00:21:56,0 --> 00:21:56,0
cometh in and through

45
00:21:56,0 --> 00:21:56,0
the Holy Messiah; for he

46
00:21:56,0 --> 00:23:08,
is full of grace and truth.

47
00:23:08,0 --> 00:23:08,0
7 Behold, he offereth

48
00:23:08,0 --> 00:23:08,0
himself a sacrifice

49
00:23:08,0 --> 00:23:08,0
for sin, to answer the

50
00:23:08,0 --> 00:23:08,0
ends of the law, unto

51
00:23:08,0 --> 00:23:08,0
all those who have a

52
00:23:08,0 --> 00:23:08,0
broken heart and a

53
00:23:08,0 --> 00:23:08,0
contrite spirit; and unto

54
00:23:08,0 --> 00:23:08,0
none else can the ends

55
00:23:08,0 --> 00:22:40,
of the law be answered.

56
00:22:40,0 --> 00:22:40,0
8 Wherefore, how great

57
00:22:40,0 --> 00:22:40,0
the importance to

58
00:22:40,0 --> 00:22:40,0
make these things known

59
00:22:40,0 --> 00:22:40,0
unto the inhabitants of

60
00:22:40,0 --> 00:22:40,0
the earth, that they

61
00:22:40,0 --> 00:22:40,0
may know that there is

62
00:22:40,0 --> 00:22:40,0
no flesh that can

63
00:22:40,0 --> 00:22:40,0
dwell in the presence of

64
00:22:40,0 --> 00:22:40,0
God, save it be

65
00:22:40,0 --> 00:22:40,0
through the merits, and

66
00:22:40,0 --> 00:22:40,0
mercy, and grace of the

67
00:22:40,0 --> 00:22:40,0
Holy Messiah, who layeth

68
00:22:40,0 --> 00:22:40,0
down his life

69
00:22:40,0 --> 00:22:40,0
according to the flesh, and

70
00:22:40,0 --> 00:22:40,0
taketh it again by the

71
00:22:40,0 --> 00:22:40,0
power of the Spirit,

72
00:22:40,0 --> 00:22:40,0
that he may bring to

73
00:22:40,0 --> 00:22:40,0
pass the resurrection of

74
00:22:40,0 --> 00:22:40,0
the dead, being the

75
00:22:40,0 --> 00:22:12,
first that should rise.

76
00:22:12,0 --> 00:22:12,0
9 Wherefore, he is

77
00:22:12,0 --> 00:22:12,0
the firstfruits

78
00:22:12,0 --> 00:22:12,0
unto God, inasmuch as

79
00:22:12,0 --> 00:22:12,0
he shall make

80
00:22:12,0 --> 00:22:12,0
intercession for all the

81
00:22:12,0 --> 00:22:12,0
children of men;

82
00:22:12,0 --> 00:22:12,0
and they that

83
00:22:12,0 --> 00:24:24,
believe in him shall be saved.

84
00:24:24,0 --> 00:24:24,0
10 And because of

85
00:24:24,0 --> 00:24:24,0
the intercession

86
00:24:24,0 --> 00:24:24,0
for all, all men

87
00:24:24,0 --> 00:24:24,0
come unto God;

88
00:24:24,0 --> 00:24:24,0
wherefore, they stand

89
00:24:24,0 --> 00:24:24,0
in the presence of

90
00:24:24,0 --> 00:24:24,0
him, to be judged

91
00:24:24,0 --> 00:24:24,0
of him according

92
00:24:24,0 --> 00:24:24,0
to the truth and

93
00:24:24,0 --> 00:24:24,0
holiness which is in

94
00:24:24,0 --> 00:24:24,0
him. Wherefore,

95
00:24:24,0 --> 00:24:24,0
the ends of the law

96
00:24:24,0 --> 00:24:24,0
which the Holy

97
00:24:24,0 --> 00:24:24,0
One hath given, unto

98
00:24:24,0 --> 00:24:24,0
the inflicting of

99
00:24:24,0 --> 00:24:24,0
the punishment

100
00:24:24,0 --> 00:24:24,0
which is affixed,

101
00:24:24,0 --> 00:24:24,0
which punishment

102
00:24:24,0 --> 00:24:24,0
that is affixed is in

103
00:24:24,0 --> 00:24:24,0
opposition to

104
00:24:24,0 --> 00:24:24,0
that of the happiness

105
00:24:24,0 --> 00:24:24,0
which is affixed,

106
00:24:24,0 --> 00:31:04,
to answer the ends of the atonement—

107
00:31:04,0 --> 00:31:04,0
11 For it must

108
00:31:04,0 --> 00:31:04,0
needs be, that

109
00:31:04,0 --> 00:31:04,0
there is an

110
00:31:04,0 --> 00:31:04,0
opposition in all things.

111
00:31:04,0 --> 00:31:04,0
If not so, my

112
00:31:04,0 --> 00:31:04,0
firstborn in the

113
00:31:04,0 --> 00:31:04,0
wilderness,

114
00:31:04,0 --> 00:31:04,0
righteousness could not

115
00:31:04,0 --> 00:31:04,0
be brought to

116
00:31:04,0 --> 00:31:04,0
pass, neither

117
00:31:04,0 --> 00:31:04,0
wickedness, neither

118
00:31:04,0 --> 00:31:04,0
holiness nor misery,

119
00:31:04,0 --> 00:31:04,0
neither good nor

120
00:31:04,0 --> 00:31:04,0
bad. Wherefore,

121
00:31:04,0 --> 00:31:04,0
all things must

122
00:31:04,0 --> 00:31:04,0
needs be a compound

123
00:31:04,0 --> 00:31:04,0
in one;

124
00:31:04,0 --> 00:31:04,0
wherefore, if it should

125
00:31:04,0 --> 00:31:04,0
be one body it

126
00:31:04,0 --> 00:31:04,0
must needs remain as

127
00:31:04,0 --> 00:31:04,0
dead, having no

128
00:31:04,0 --> 00:31:04,0
life neither

129
00:31:04,0 --> 00:31:04,0
death, nor corruption

130
00:31:04,0 --> 00:31:04,0
nor

131
00:31:04,0 --> 00:31:04,0
incorruption, happiness nor

132
00:31:04,0 --> 00:30:50,
misery, neither sense nor insensibility.

133
00:30:50,0 --> 00:30:50,0
12 Wherefore, it

134
00:30:50,0 --> 00:30:50,0
must needs have

135
00:30:50,0 --> 00:30:50,0
been created

136
00:30:50,0 --> 00:30:50,0
for a thing of

137
00:30:50,0 --> 00:30:50,0
naught; wherefore

138
00:30:50,0 --> 00:30:50,0
there would have

139
00:30:50,0 --> 00:30:50,0
been no purpose

140
00:30:50,0 --> 00:30:50,0
in the end of

141
00:30:50,0 --> 00:30:50,0
its creation.

142
00:30:50,0 --> 00:30:50,0
Wherefore, this

143
00:30:50,0 --> 00:30:50,0
thing must needs

144
00:30:50,0 --> 00:30:50,0
destroy the wisdom

145
00:30:50,0 --> 00:30:50,0
of God and his

146
00:30:50,0 --> 00:30:50,0
eternal purposes,

147
00:30:50,0 --> 00:30:50,0
and also the

148
00:30:50,0 --> 00:30:50,0
power, and the

149
00:30:50,0 --> 00:34:20,
mercy, and the justice of God.

150
00:34:20,0 --> 00:34:20,0
13 And if ye

151
00:34:20,0 --> 00:34:20,0
shall say there

152
00:34:20,0 --> 00:34:20,0
is no law, ye

153
00:34:20,0 --> 00:34:20,0
shall also say

154
00:34:20,0 --> 00:34:20,0
there is no sin.

155
00:34:20,0 --> 00:34:20,0
If ye shall say

156
00:34:20,0 --> 00:34:20,0
there is no

157
00:34:20,0 --> 00:34:20,0
sin, ye shall

158
00:34:20,0 --> 00:34:20,0
also say there is

159
00:34:20,0 --> 00:34:20,0
no

160
00:34:20,0 --> 00:34:20,0
righteousness. And if there

161
00:34:20,0 --> 00:34:20,0
be no

162
00:34:20,0 --> 00:34:20,0
righteousness there be

163
00:34:20,0 --> 00:34:20,0
no happiness.

164
00:34:20,0 --> 00:34:20,0
And if there be

165
00:34:20,0 --> 00:34:20,0
no

166
00:34:20,0 --> 00:34:20,0
righteousness nor happiness

167
00:34:20,0 --> 00:34:20,0
there be no

168
00:34:20,0 --> 00:34:20,0
punishment nor

169
00:34:20,0 --> 00:34:20,0
misery. And if

170
00:34:20,0 --> 00:34:20,0
these things are

171
00:34:20,0 --> 00:34:20,0
not there is no

172
00:34:20,0 --> 00:34:20,0
God. And if

173
00:34:20,0 --> 00:34:20,0
there is no God

174
00:34:20,0 --> 00:34:20,0
we are not,

175
00:34:20,0 --> 00:34:20,0
neither the earth;

176
00:34:20,0 --> 00:34:20,0
for there could

177
00:34:20,0 --> 00:34:20,0
have been no

178
00:34:20,0 --> 00:34:20,0
creation of

179
00:34:20,0 --> 00:34:20,0
things, neither to

180
00:34:20,0 --> 00:34:20,0
act nor to be

181
00:34:20,0 --> 00:34:20,0
acted upon;

182
00:34:20,0 --> 00:38:32,
wherefore, all things must have vanished away.

183
00:38:32,0 --> 00:38:32,0
14 And now, my

184
00:38:32,0 --> 00:38:32,0
sons, I speak

185
00:38:32,0 --> 00:38:32,0
unto you

186
00:38:32,0 --> 00:38:32,0
these things for

187
00:38:32,0 --> 00:38:32,0
your profit and

188
00:38:32,0 --> 00:38:32,0
learning; for

189
00:38:32,0 --> 00:38:32,0
there is a

190
00:38:32,0 --> 00:38:32,0
God, and he hath

191
00:38:32,0 --> 00:38:32,0
created all

192
00:38:32,0 --> 00:38:32,0
things, both

193
00:38:32,0 --> 00:38:32,0
the heavens and

194
00:38:32,0 --> 00:38:32,0
the earth, and

195
00:38:32,0 --> 00:38:32,0
all things

196
00:38:32,0 --> 00:38:32,0
that in them

197
00:38:32,0 --> 00:38:32,0
are, both things

198
00:38:32,0 --> 00:38:32,0
to act and

199
00:38:32,0 --> 00:44:42,
things to be acted upon.

200
00:44:42,0 --> 00:44:42,0
15 And to

201
00:44:42,0 --> 00:44:42,0
bring about his

202
00:44:42,0 --> 00:44:42,0
eternal

203
00:44:42,0 --> 00:44:42,0
purposes in the

204
00:44:42,0 --> 00:44:42,0
end of man,

205
00:44:42,0 --> 00:44:42,0
after he had

206
00:44:42,0 --> 00:44:42,0
created our

207
00:44:42,0 --> 00:44:42,0
first parents,

208
00:44:42,0 --> 00:44:42,0
and the beasts

209
00:44:42,0 --> 00:44:42,0
of the field

210
00:44:42,0 --> 00:44:42,0
and the fowls

211
00:44:42,0 --> 00:44:42,0
of the air,

212
00:44:42,0 --> 00:44:42,0
and in fine,

213
00:44:42,0 --> 00:44:42,0
all things

214
00:44:42,0 --> 00:44:42,0
which are

215
00:44:42,0 --> 00:44:42,0
created, it must

216
00:44:42,0 --> 00:44:42,0
needs be that

217
00:44:42,0 --> 00:44:42,0
there was an

218
00:44:42,0 --> 00:44:42,0
opposition;

219
00:44:42,0 --> 00:44:42,0
even the

220
00:44:42,0 --> 00:44:42,0
forbidden fruit in

221
00:44:42,0 --> 00:44:42,0
opposition

222
00:44:42,0 --> 00:44:42,0
to the tree of

223
00:44:42,0 --> 00:44:42,0
life; the

224
00:44:42,0 --> 00:44:56,
one being sweet and the other bitter.

225
00:44:56,0 --> 00:44:56,0
16

226
00:44:56,0 --> 00:44:56,0
Wherefore, the Lord

227
00:44:56,0 --> 00:44:56,0
God gave unto

228
00:44:56,0 --> 00:44:56,0
man that he

229
00:44:56,0 --> 00:44:56,0
should act

230
00:44:56,0 --> 00:44:56,0
for himself.

231
00:44:56,0 --> 00:44:56,0
Wherefore,

232
00:44:56,0 --> 00:44:56,0
man could

233
00:44:56,0 --> 00:44:56,0
not act for

234
00:44:56,0 --> 00:44:56,0
himself save

235
00:44:56,0 --> 00:44:56,0
it should be

236
00:44:56,0 --> 00:44:56,0
that he was

237
00:44:56,0 --> 00:44:56,0
enticed by

238
00:44:56,0 --> 00:51:36,
the one or the other.

239
00:51:36,0 --> 00:51:36,0
17 And I,

240
00:51:36,0 --> 00:51:36,0
Lehi,

241
00:51:36,0 --> 00:51:36,0
according to the

242
00:51:36,0 --> 00:51:36,0
things

243
00:51:36,0 --> 00:51:36,0
which I have

244
00:51:36,0 --> 00:51:36,0
read, must

245
00:51:36,0 --> 00:51:36,0
needs suppose

246
00:51:36,0 --> 00:51:36,0
that an

247
00:51:36,0 --> 00:51:36,0
angel of God,

248
00:51:36,0 --> 00:51:36,0
according

249
00:51:36,0 --> 00:51:36,0
to that

250
00:51:36,0 --> 00:51:36,0
which is

251
00:51:36,0 --> 00:51:36,0
written, had

252
00:51:36,0 --> 00:51:36,0
fallen from

253
00:51:36,0 --> 00:51:36,0
heaven;

254
00:51:36,0 --> 00:51:36,0
wherefore, he

255
00:51:36,0 --> 00:51:36,0
became a

256
00:51:36,0 --> 00:51:36,0
devil, having

257
00:51:36,0 --> 00:51:36,0
sought that

258
00:51:36,0 --> 00:57:04,
which was evil before God.

259
00:57:04,0 --> 00:57:04,0
18 And

260
00:57:04,0 --> 00:57:04,0
because he

261
00:57:04,0 --> 00:57:04,0
had fallen

262
00:57:04,0 --> 00:57:04,0
from

263
00:57:04,0 --> 00:57:04,0
heaven, and had

264
00:57:04,0 --> 00:57:04,0
become

265
00:57:04,0 --> 00:57:04,0
miserable

266
00:57:04,0 --> 00:57:04,0
forever, he

267
00:57:04,0 --> 00:57:04,0
sought also

268
00:57:04,0 --> 00:57:04,0
the

269
00:57:04,0 --> 00:57:04,0
misery of all

270
00:57:04,0 --> 00:57:04,0
mankind.

271
00:57:04,0 --> 00:57:04,0
Wherefore,

272
00:57:04,0 --> 00:57:04,0
he said

273
00:57:04,0 --> 00:57:04,0
unto Eve,

274
00:57:04,0 --> 00:57:04,0
yea, even

275
00:57:04,0 --> 00:57:04,0
that old

276
00:57:04,0 --> 00:57:04,0
serpent, who

277
00:57:04,0 --> 00:57:04,0
is the

278
00:57:04,0 --> 00:57:04,0
devil, who is

279
00:57:04,0 --> 00:57:04,0
the father

280
00:57:04,0 --> 00:57:04,0
of all

281
00:57:04,0 --> 00:57:04,0
lies,

282
00:57:04,0 --> 00:57:04,0
wherefore he

283
00:57:04,0 --> 00:57:04,0
said: Partake

284
00:57:04,0 --> 00:57:04,0
of the

285
00:57:04,0 --> 00:57:04,0
forbidden

286
00:57:04,0 --> 00:57:04,0
fruit, and

287
00:57:04,0 --> 00:57:04,0
ye shall

288
00:57:04,0 --> 00:57:04,0
not die, but

289
00:57:04,0 --> 00:57:04,0
ye shall

290
00:57:04,0 --> 00:58:48,
be as God, knowing good and evil.

291
00:58:48,0 --> 00:58:48,0
19 And

292
00:58:48,0 --> 00:58:48,0
after Adam

293
00:58:48,0 --> 00:58:48,0
and Eve

294
00:58:48,0 --> 00:58:48,0
had

295
00:58:48,0 --> 00:58:48,0
partaken of the

296
00:58:48,0 --> 00:58:48,0


297
00:58:48,0 --> 00:58:48,0
forbidden fruit

298
00:58:48,0 --> 00:58:48,0
they were

299
00:58:48,0 --> 00:58:48,0
driven

300
00:58:48,0 --> 00:58:48,0
out of the

301
00:58:48,0 --> 00:58:48,0
garden of

302
00:58:48,0 --> 00:58:48,0
Eden, to

303
00:58:48,0 --> 01:02:18,
till the earth.

304
01:02:18,0 --> 01:02:18,0
20 And

305
01:02:18,0 --> 01:02:18,0
they have

306
01:02:18,0 --> 01:02:18,0
brought

307
01:02:18,0 --> 01:02:18,0
forth

308
01:02:18,0 --> 01:02:18,0
children;

309
01:02:18,0 --> 01:02:18,0
yea,

310
01:02:18,0 --> 01:02:18,0
even the

311
01:02:18,0 --> 01:02:18,0
family of

312
01:02:18,0 --> 01:10:15,
all the earth.

313
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
21 And

314
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
the

315
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
days of

316
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
the

317
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
children of

318
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
men

319
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
were

320
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
prolonged,

321
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0


322
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
according to

323
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
the will

324
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
of God,

325
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
that

326
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
they

327
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
might

328
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
repent

329
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
while in

330
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
the

331
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
flesh;

332
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
wherefore,

333
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
their

334
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
state

335
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
became a

336
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
state of

337
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0


338
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
probation,

339
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
and their

340
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
time

341
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
was

342
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
lengthened,

343
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0


344
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
according to

345
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
the

346
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0


347
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
commandments

348
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
which the

349
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
Lord God

350
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
gave

351
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
unto the

352
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0


353
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
children of

354
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
men. For

355
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
he

356
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
gave

357
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
commandment

358
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
that

359
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
all men

360
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
must

361
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
repent;

362
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
for he

363
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
showed

364
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
unto all

365
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
men

366
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:15,0
that they

367
01:10:15,0 --> 01:10:01,
were lost, because of the transgression of their parents.

368
01:10:01,0 --> 01:10:01,0
22 And

369
01:10:01,0 --> 01:10:01,0
now,

370
01:10:01,0 --> 01:10:01,0


371
01:10:01,0 --> 01:10:01,0
behold, if

372
01:10:01,0 --> 01:10:01,0
Adam

373
01:10:01,0 --> 01:10:01,0
had not

374
01:10:01,0 --> 01:10:01,0


375
01:10:01,0 --> 01:10:01,0
transgressed

376
01:10:01,0 --> 01:10:01,0
he

377
01:10:01,0 --> 01:10:01,0
would

378
01:10:01,0 --> 01:10:01,0
not have

379
01:10:01,0 --> 01:10:01,0


380
01:10:01,0 --> 01:10:01,0
fallen, but

381
01:10:01,0 --> 01:10:01,0
he

382
01:10:01,0 --> 01:10:01,0
would

383
01:10:01,0 --> 01:10:01,0
have

384
01:10:01,0 --> 01:10:01,0
remained

385
01:10:01,0 --> 01:10:01,0
in the

386
01:10:01,0 --> 01:10:01,0


387
01:10:01,0 --> 01:10:01,0
garden of

388
01:10:01,0 --> 01:10:01,0
Eden.

389
01:10:01,0 --> 01:10:01,0
And all

390
01:10:01,0 --> 01:10:01,0


391
01:10:01,0 --> 01:10:01,0
things

392
01:10:01,0 --> 01:10:01,0
which were

393
01:10:01,0 --> 01:10:01,0


394
01:10:01,0 --> 01:10:01,0
created

395
01:10:01,0 --> 01:10:01,0
must have

396
01:10:01,0 --> 01:10:01,0


397
01:10:01,0 --> 01:10:01,0
remained in

398
01:10:01,0 --> 01:10:01,0
the

399
01:10:01,0 --> 01:10:01,0
same

400
01:10:01,0 --> 01:10:01,0
state in

401
01:10:01,0 --> 01:10:01,0
which

402
01:10:01,0 --> 01:10:01,0
they

403
01:10:01,0 --> 01:10:01,0
were

404
01:10:01,0 --> 01:10:01,0
after

405
01:10:01,0 --> 01:10:01,0
they

406
01:10:01,0 --> 01:10:01,0
were

407
01:10:01,0 --> 01:10:01,0
created;

408
01:10:01,0 --> 01:10:01,0
and

409
01:10:01,0 --> 01:14:30,
they must have remained forever, and had no end.

410
01:14:30,0 --> 01:14:30,0
23

411
01:14:30,0 --> 01:14:30,0
And

412
01:14:30,0 --> 01:14:30,0
they

413
01:14:30,0 --> 01:14:30,0
would

414
01:14:30,0 --> 01:14:30,0
have

415
01:14:30,0 --> 01:14:30,0
had no

418
01:14:30,0 --> 01:14:30,0


419
01:14:30,0 --> 01:14:30,0
wherefore

420
01:14:30,0 --> 01:14:30,0
they

421
01:14:30,0 --> 01:14:30,0
would

422
01:14:30,0 --> 01:14:30,0
have

423
01:14:30,0 --> 01:14:30,0


424
01:14:30,0 --> 01:14:30,0
remained

425
01:14:30,0 --> 01:14:30,0
in a

426
01:14:30,0 --> 01:14:30,0
state

427
01:14:30,0 --> 01:14:30,0
of

428
01:14:30,0 --> 01:14:30,0


429
01:14:30,0 --> 01:14:30,0
innocence,

430
01:14:30,0 --> 01:14:30,0


431
01:14:30,0 --> 01:14:30,0
having no

432
01:14:30,0 --> 01:14:30,0
joy,

433
01:14:30,0 --> 01:14:30,0
for

434
01:14:30,0 --> 01:14:30,0
they

435
01:14:30,0 --> 01:14:30,0
knew

436
01:14:30,0 --> 01:14:30,0
no

437
01:14:30,0 --> 01:14:30,0
misery;

438
01:14:30,0 --> 01:14:30,0
doing

439
01:14:30,0 --> 01:23:39,
no good, for they knew no sin.

440
01:23:39,0 --> 01:23:39,0
24

441
01:23:39,0 --> 01:23:39,0
But

442
01:23:39,0 --> 01:23:39,0
behold,

443
01:23:39,0 --> 01:23:39,0
all

444
01:23:39,0 --> 01:23:39,0
things

445
01:23:39,0 --> 01:23:39,0
have

446
01:23:39,0 --> 01:23:39,0
been

447
01:23:39,0 --> 01:23:39,0
done

448
01:23:39,0 --> 01:23:39,0
in

449
01:23:39,0 --> 01:23:39,0
the

450
01:23:39,0 --> 01:23:39,0
wisdom

451
01:23:39,0 --> 01:23:39,0
of

452
01:23:39,0 --> 01:23:39,0
him who

453
01:23:39,0 --> 01:23:39,0


454
01:23:39,0 --> 01:23:39,0
knoweth

455
01:23:39,0 --> 01:23:39,0
