Chapter 2 Redemption comes through the Holy

2
00:00:03,0 --> 00:00:06,0
 Messiah—Freedom of choice (agency) is essential to

3
00:00:06,0 --> 00:00:09,0
 existence and progression—Adam fell that men might

4
00:00:09,0 --> 00:00:12,0
 be—Men are free to choose liberty and eternal life.

5

 About 588–570 B.C.

6
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:28,949
1 And now, Jacob, I speak unto you: Thou art my

7
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:41,949
 firstborn in the days of my tribulation in the

8
00:00:41,949 --> 00:00:54,949
 wilderness. And behold, in thy childhood thou hast

9
00:00:54,949 --> 00:01:07,949
 suffered afflictions and much sorrow, because of the

10
00:01:07,949 --> 00:01:20,949
 rudeness of thy brethren

11
00:01:20,48 --> 00:01:28,813
2 Nevertheless, Jacob, my firstborn in the

12
00:01:28,813 --> 00:01:37,146
 wilderness, thou knowest the greatness of God; and he

13
00:01:37,146 --> 00:01:45,479
 shall consecrate thine afflictions for thy gain

14
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:52,035
3 Wherefore, thy soul shall be blessed, and thou

15
00:01:52,035 --> 00:01:58,464
 shalt dwell safely with thy brother, Nephi; and thy

16
00:01:58,464 --> 00:02:04,893
 days shall be spent in the service of thy God.

17
00:02:04,893 --> 00:02:11,322
 Wherefore, I know that thou art redeemed, because of

18
00:02:11,322 --> 00:02:17,751
 the righteousness of thy Redeemer; for thou hast

19
00:02:17,751 --> 00:02:24,18
 beheld that in the fulness of time he cometh to

20
00:02:24,18 --> 00:02:30,608
 bring salvation unto men

21
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:38,116
4 And thou hast beheld in thy youth his glory;

22
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:45,949
 wherefore, thou art blessed even as they unto whom he

23
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:53,782
 shall minister in the flesh; for the Spirit is

24
00:02:53,782 --> 00:03:01,615
 the same, yesterday, today, and forever. And the way

25
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:09,448
 is prepared from the fall of man, and salvation

26
00:03:09,448 --> 00:03:17,281
 is free

27
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:25,911
5 And men are instructed sufficiently that they

28
00:03:25,911 --> 00:03:34,625
 know good from evil. And the law is given unto men.

29
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:43,339
 And by the law no flesh is justified; or, by the

30
00:03:43,339 --> 00:03:52,053
 law men are cut off. Yea, by the temporal law they

31
00:03:52,053 --> 00:04:00,767
 were cut off; and also, by the spiritual law they

32
00:04:00,767 --> 00:04:09,481
 perish from that which is good, and become

33
00:04:09,481 --> 00:04:18,195
 miserable forever

34
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:27,658
6 Wherefore, redemption cometh in and through the

35
00:04:27,658 --> 00:04:36,658
 Holy Messiah; for he is full of grace and truth

36
00:04:36,51 --> 00:04:44,76
7 Behold, he offereth himself a sacrifice for sin,

37
00:04:44,76 --> 00:04:53,01
 to answer the ends of the law, unto all those who

38
00:04:53,01 --> 00:05:01,26
 have a broken heart and a contrite spirit; and

39
00:05:01,26 --> 00:05:09,51
 unto none else can the ends of the law be answered

40
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:17,099
8 Wherefore, how great the importance to make

41
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:24,655
 these things known unto the inhabitants of the earth,

42
00:05:24,655 --> 00:05:32,211
 that they may know that there is no flesh that can

43
00:05:32,211 --> 00:05:39,767
 dwell in the presence of God, save it be through

44
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:47,323
 the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy

45
00:05:47,323 --> 00:05:54,879
 Messiah, who layeth down his life according to the

46
00:05:54,879 --> 00:06:02,435
 flesh, and taketh it again by the power of the Spirit,

47
00:06:02,435 --> 00:06:09,991
 that he may bring to pass the resurrection of the

48
00:06:09,991 --> 00:06:17,547
 dead, being the first that should rise

49
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:23,627
9 Wherefore, he is the firstfruits unto God,

50
00:06:23,627 --> 00:06:29,877
 inasmuch as he shall make intercession for all the

51
00:06:29,877 --> 00:06:36,127
 children of men; and they that believe in him shall be

52
00:06:36,127 --> 00:06:42,377
 saved

53
00:06:42,535 --> 00:07:01,979
10 And because of the intercession for all, all

54
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:21,423
 men come unto God; wherefore, they stand in the

55
00:07:21,423 --> 00:07:40,867
 presence of him, to be judged of him according to the

56
00:07:40,867 --> 00:08:00,311
 truth and holiness which is in him. Wherefore, the

57
00:08:00,311 --> 00:08:19,755
 ends of the law which the Holy One hath given,

58
00:08:19,755 --> 00:08:39,199
 unto the inflicting of the punishment which is

59
00:08:39,199 --> 00:08:58,643
 affixed, which punishment that is affixed is in

60
00:08:58,643 --> 00:09:18,087
 opposition to that of the happiness which is affixed, to

61
00:09:18,087 --> 00:09:37,531
 answer the ends of the atonement

62
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:45,177
11 For it must needs be, that there is an

63
00:09:45,177 --> 00:09:52,377
 opposition in all things. If not so, my firstborn in the

64
00:09:52,377 --> 00:09:59,577
 wilderness, righteousness could not be brought to

65
00:09:59,577 --> 00:10:06,777
 pass, neither wickedness, neither holiness nor

66
00:10:06,777 --> 00:10:13,977
 misery, neither good nor bad. Wherefore, all things

67
00:10:13,977 --> 00:10:21,177
 must needs be a compound in one; wherefore, if it

68
00:10:21,177 --> 00:10:28,377
 should be one body it must needs remain as dead,

69
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:35,577
 having no life neither death, nor corruption nor

70
00:10:35,577 --> 00:10:42,777
 incorruption, happiness nor misery, neither sense nor

71
00:10:42,777 --> 00:10:49,977
 insensibility

72
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:49,916
12 Wherefore, it must needs have been created for

73
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:50,083
 a thing of naught; wherefore there would have been

74
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:50,25
 no purpose in the end of its creation. Wherefore,

75
00:10:50,25 --> 00:10:50,417
 this thing must needs destroy the wisdom of God

76
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:50,584
 and his eternal purposes, and also the power, and

77
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:50,751
 the mercy, and the justice of God

78
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:54,292
13 And if ye shall say there is no law, ye shall

79
00:10:54,292 --> 00:10:58,201
 also say there is no sin. If ye shall say there is

80
00:10:58,201 --> 00:11:02,11
 no sin, ye shall also say there is no

81
00:11:02,11 --> 00:11:06,019
 righteousness. And if there be no righteousness there be no

82
00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:09,928
 happiness. And if there be no righteousness nor

83
00:11:09,928 --> 00:11:13,837
 happiness there be no punishment nor misery. And if

84
00:11:13,837 --> 00:11:17,746
 these things are not there is no God. And if there

85
00:11:17,746 --> 00:11:21,655
 is no God we are not, neither the earth; for there

86
00:11:21,655 --> 00:11:25,564
 could have been no creation of things, neither to

87
00:11:25,564 --> 00:11:29,473
 act nor to be acted upon; wherefore, all things

88
00:11:29,473 --> 00:11:33,382
 must have vanished away

89
00:11:33,092 --> 00:12:01,692
14 And now, my sons, I speak unto you these things

90
00:12:01,692 --> 00:12:30,292
 for your profit and learning; for there is a God,

91
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:58,892
 and he hath created all things, both the heavens

92
00:12:58,892 --> 00:13:27,492
 and the earth, and all things that in them are,

93
00:13:27,492 --> 00:13:56,092
 both things to act and things to be acted upon

94
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:58,922
15 And to bring about his eternal purposes in the

95
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:01,208
 end of man, after he had created our first

96
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,494
 parents, and the beasts of the field and the fowls of the

97
00:14:03,494 --> 00:14:05,78
 air, and in fine, all things which are created,

98
00:14:05,78 --> 00:14:08,066
 it must needs be that there was an opposition; even

99
00:14:08,066 --> 00:14:10,352
 the forbidden fruit in opposition to the tree of

100
00:14:10,352 --> 00:14:12,638
 life; the one being sweet and the other bitter

101
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:14,585
16 Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto man that he

102
00:14:14,585 --> 00:14:16,585
 should act for himself. Wherefore, man could not

103
00:14:16,585 --> 00:14:18,585
 act for himself save it should be that he was

104
00:14:18,585 --> 00:14:20,585
 enticed by the one or the other

105
00:14:20,56 --> 00:14:20,76
17 And I, Lehi, according to the things which I

106
00:14:20,76 --> 00:14:20,96
 have read, must needs suppose that an angel of God,

107
00:14:20,96 --> 00:14:21,16
 according to that which is written, had fallen

108
00:14:21,16 --> 00:14:21,36
 from heaven; wherefore, he became a devil, having

109
00:14:21,36 --> 00:14:21,56
 sought that which was evil before God

110
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:28,618
18 And because he had fallen from heaven, and had

111
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:35,475
 become miserable forever, he sought also the

112
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:42,332
 misery of all mankind. Wherefore, he said unto Eve,

113
00:14:42,332 --> 00:14:49,189
 yea, even that old serpent, who is the devil, who is

114
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:56,046
 the father of all lies, wherefore he said: Partake

115
00:14:56,046 --> 00:15:02,903
 of the forbidden fruit, and ye shall not die, but

116
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:09,76
 ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil

117
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:15,708
19 And after Adam and Eve had partaken of the

118
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:22,041
 forbidden fruit they were driven out of the garden of

119
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:28,374
 Eden, to till the earth

120
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:34,594
20 And they have brought forth children; yea, even

121
00:15:34,594 --> 00:15:40,594
 the family of all the earth

122
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:47,606
21 And the days of the children of men were

123
00:15:47,606 --> 00:15:54,606
 prolonged, according to the will of God, that they might

124
00:15:54,606 --> 00:16:01,606
 repent while in the flesh; wherefore, their state

125
00:16:01,606 --> 00:16:08,606
 became a state of probation, and their time was

126
00:16:08,606 --> 00:16:15,606
 lengthened, according to the commandments which the

127
00:16:15,606 --> 00:16:22,606
 Lord God gave unto the children of men. For he

128
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:29,606
 gave commandment that all men must repent; for he

129
00:16:29,606 --> 00:16:36,606
 showed unto all men that they were lost, because of

130
00:16:36,606 --> 00:16:43,606
 the transgression of their parents

131
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:50,436
22 And now, behold, if Adam had not transgressed

132
00:16:50,436 --> 00:16:57,436
 he would not have fallen, but he would have

133
00:16:57,436 --> 00:17:04,436
 remained in the garden of Eden. And all things which were

134
00:17:04,436 --> 00:17:11,436
 created must have remained in the same state in

135
00:17:11,436 --> 00:17:18,436
 which they were after they were created; and they

136
00:17:18,436 --> 00:17:25,436
 must have remained forever, and had no end

137
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:33,261
23 And they would have had no children; wherefore

138
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:41,011
 they would have remained in a state of innocence,

139
00:17:41,011 --> 00:17:48,761
 having no joy, for they knew no misery; doing no

140
00:17:48,761 --> 00:17:56,511
 good, for they knew no sin

141
00:17:56,409 --> 00:18:02,909
24 But behold, all things have been done in the

142
00:18:02,909 --> 00:18:09,409
 wisdom of him who knoweth all things

143
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:17,455
25 Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that

144
00:18:17,455 --> 00:18:25,455
 they might have joy

145
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:32,829
26 And the Messiah cometh in the fulness of time,

146
00:18:32,829 --> 00:18:40,454
 that he may redeem the children of men from the

147
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:48,079
 fall. And because that they are redeemed from the

148
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:55,704
 fall they have become free forever, knowing good

149
00:18:55,704 --> 00:19:03,329
 from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted

150
00:19:03,329 --> 00:19:10,954
 upon, save it be by the punishment of the law at

151
00:19:10,954 --> 00:19:18,579
 the great and last day, according to the

152
00:19:18,579 --> 00:19:26,204
 commandments which God hath given

153
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:33,04
27 Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh;

154
00:19:33,04 --> 00:19:39,915
 and all things are given them which are expedient

155
00:19:39,915 --> 00:19:46,79
 unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and

156
00:19:46,79 --> 00:19:53,665
 eternal life, through the great Mediator of all

157
00:19:53,665 --> 00:20:00,54
 men, or to choose captivity and death, according to

158
00:20:00,54 --> 00:20:07,415
 the captivity and power of the devil; for he

159
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:14,29
 seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto

160
00:20:14,29 --> 00:20:21,165
 himself

161
00:20:21,02 --> 00:20:27,82
28 And now, my sons, I would that ye should look

162
00:20:27,82 --> 00:20:34,62
 to the great Mediator, and hearken unto his great

163
00:20:34,62 --> 00:20:41,42
 commandments; and be faithful unto his words, and

164
00:20:41,42 --> 00:20:48,22
 choose eternal life, according to the will of his

165
00:20:48,22 --> 00:20:55,02
 Holy Spirit

166
00:20:55,321 --> 00:21:02,121
29 And not choose eternal death, according to the

167
00:21:02,121 --> 00:21:08,921
 will of the flesh and the evil which is therein,

168
00:21:08,921 --> 00:21:15,721
 which giveth the spirit of the devil power to

169
00:21:15,721 --> 00:21:22,521
 captivate, to bring you down to hell, that he may reign

170
00:21:22,521 --> 00:21:29,321
 over you in his own kingdom

171
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:30,988
30 I have spoken these few words unto you all, my

172
00:21:30,988 --> 00:21:32,388
 sons, in the last days of my probation; and I have

173
00:21:32,388 --> 00:21:33,788
 chosen the good part, according to the words of

174
00:21:33,788 --> 00:21:35,188
 the prophet. And I have none other object save it

175
00:21:35,188 --> 00:21:36,588
 be the everlasting welfare of your souls. Amen.
