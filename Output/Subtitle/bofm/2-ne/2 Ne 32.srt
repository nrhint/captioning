00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:02,333
Chapter 32 Angels speak by the power of the Holy

2
00:00:02,333 --> 00:00:04,666
 Ghost—Men must pray and gain knowledge for

3
00:00:04,666 --> 00:00:06,999
 themselves from the Holy Ghost. About 559–545 B.C.

4
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,575
1 And now, behold, my beloved brethren, I suppose

5
00:00:09,575 --> 00:00:11,175
 that ye ponder somewhat in your hearts concerning

6
00:00:11,175 --> 00:00:12,775
 that which ye should do after ye have entered in

7
00:00:12,775 --> 00:00:14,375
 by the way. But, behold, why do ye ponder these

8
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:15,975
 things in your hearts

9
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,549
2 Do ye not remember that I said unto you that

10
00:00:17,549 --> 00:00:19,149
 after ye had received the Holy Ghost ye could speak

11
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:20,749
 with the tongue of angels? And now, how could ye

12
00:00:20,749 --> 00:00:22,349
 speak with the tongue of angels save it were by the

13
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:23,949
 Holy Ghost

14
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,524
3 Angels speak by the power of the Holy Ghost;

15
00:00:25,524 --> 00:00:27,124
 wherefore, they speak the words of Christ. Wherefore,

16
00:00:27,124 --> 00:00:28,724
 I said unto you, feast upon the words of Christ;

17
00:00:28,724 --> 00:00:30,324
 for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all

18
00:00:30,324 --> 00:00:31,924
 things what ye should do

19
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,308
6 Behold, this is the doctrine of Christ, and

20
00:00:09,308 --> 00:00:10,641
 there will be no more doctrine given until after he

21
00:00:10,641 --> 00:00:11,974
 shall manifest himself unto you in the flesh. And

22
00:00:11,974 --> 00:00:13,307
 when he shall manifest himself unto you in the

23
00:00:13,307 --> 00:00:14,64
 flesh, the things which he shall say unto you shall ye

24
00:00:14,64 --> 00:00:15,973
 observe to do

25
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,092
7 And now I, Nephi, cannot say more; the Spirit

26
00:00:17,092 --> 00:00:18,235
 stoppeth mine utterance, and I am left to mourn

27
00:00:18,235 --> 00:00:19,378
 because of the unbelief, and the wickedness, and the

28
00:00:19,378 --> 00:00:20,521
 ignorance, and the stiffneckedness of men; for they

29
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:21,664
 will not search knowledge, nor understand great

30
00:00:21,664 --> 00:00:22,807
 knowledge, when it is given unto them in plainness,

31
00:00:22,807 --> 00:00:23,95
 even as plain as word can be

32
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,067
8 And now, my beloved brethren, I perceive that ye

33
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:26,21
 ponder still in your hearts; and it grieveth me

34
00:00:26,21 --> 00:00:27,353
 that I must speak concerning this thing. For if ye

35
00:00:27,353 --> 00:00:28,496
 would hearken unto the Spirit which teacheth a man

36
00:00:28,496 --> 00:00:29,639
 to pray, ye would know that ye must pray; for the

37
00:00:29,639 --> 00:00:30,782
 evil spirit teacheth not a man to pray, but

38
00:00:30,782 --> 00:00:31,925
 teacheth him that he must not pray

39
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:32,47
9 But behold, I say unto you that ye must pray

40
00:00:32,47 --> 00:00:33,041
 always, and not faint; that ye must not perform any

41
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:33,612
 thing unto the Lord save in the first place ye

42
00:00:33,612 --> 00:00:34,183
 shall pray unto the Father in the name of Christ, that

43
00:00:34,183 --> 00:00:34,754
 he will consecrate thy performance unto thee,

44
00:00:34,754 --> 00:00:35,325
 that thy performance may be for the welfare of thy

45
00:00:35,325 --> 00:00:35,896
 soul.
