00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 32 Angels speak by the power of the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Holy Ghost—Men must pray and gain knowledge for

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:10:25,
themselves from the Holy Ghost. About 559–545 B.C. 

4
00:10:25,0 --> 00:10:25,0
1 And now, behold, my beloved brethren, I

5
00:10:25,0 --> 00:10:25,0
suppose that ye ponder somewhat in your

6
00:10:25,0 --> 00:10:25,0
hearts concerning that which ye should do after

7
00:10:25,0 --> 00:10:25,0
ye have entered in by the way. But,

8
00:10:25,0 --> 00:14:23,
behold, why do ye ponder these things in your hearts?

9
00:14:23,0 --> 00:14:23,0
2 Do ye not remember that I said unto you

10
00:14:23,0 --> 00:14:23,0
that after ye had received the Holy Ghost

11
00:14:23,0 --> 00:14:23,0
ye could speak with the tongue of angels?

12
00:14:23,0 --> 00:14:23,0
And now, how could ye speak with the

13
00:14:23,0 --> 00:16:07,
tongue of angels save it were by the Holy Ghost?

14
00:16:07,0 --> 00:16:07,0
3 Angels speak by the power of the

15
00:16:07,0 --> 00:16:07,0
Holy Ghost; wherefore, they speak the

16
00:16:07,0 --> 00:16:07,0
words of Christ. Wherefore, I said

17
00:16:07,0 --> 00:16:07,0
unto you, feast upon the words of

18
00:16:07,0 --> 00:16:07,0
Christ; for behold, the words of Christ

19
00:16:07,0 --> 00:15:39,
will tell you all things what ye should do.

20
00:15:39,0 --> 00:15:39,0
4 Wherefore, now after I have

21
00:15:39,0 --> 00:15:39,0
spoken these words, if ye cannot

22
00:15:39,0 --> 00:15:39,0
understand them it will be because ye

23
00:15:39,0 --> 00:15:39,0
ask not, neither do ye knock;

24
00:15:39,0 --> 00:15:39,0
wherefore, ye are not brought into the

25
00:15:39,0 --> 00:15:11,
light, but must perish in the dark.

26
00:15:11,0 --> 00:15:11,0
5 For behold, again I say unto

27
00:15:11,0 --> 00:15:11,0
you that if ye will enter in

28
00:15:11,0 --> 00:15:11,0
by the way, and receive the

29
00:15:11,0 --> 00:15:11,0
Holy Ghost, it will show unto

30
00:15:11,0 --> 00:14:57,
you all things what ye should do.

31
00:14:57,0 --> 00:14:57,0
6 Behold, this is the

32
00:14:57,0 --> 00:14:57,0
doctrine of Christ, and there will

33
00:14:57,0 --> 00:14:57,0
be no more doctrine given

34
00:14:57,0 --> 00:14:57,0
until after he shall manifest

35
00:14:57,0 --> 00:14:57,0
himself unto you in the flesh.

36
00:14:57,0 --> 00:14:57,0
And when he shall manifest

37
00:14:57,0 --> 00:14:57,0
himself unto you in the flesh,

38
00:14:57,0 --> 00:14:57,0
the things which he shall say

39
00:14:57,0 --> 00:14:29,
unto you shall ye observe to do.

40
00:14:29,0 --> 00:14:29,0
7 And now I, Nephi, cannot

41
00:14:29,0 --> 00:14:29,0
say more; the Spirit

42
00:14:29,0 --> 00:14:29,0
stoppeth mine utterance, and I am

43
00:14:29,0 --> 00:14:29,0
left to mourn because of

44
00:14:29,0 --> 00:14:29,0
the unbelief, and the

45
00:14:29,0 --> 00:14:29,0
wickedness, and the ignorance,

46
00:14:29,0 --> 00:14:29,0
and the stiffneckedness of

47
00:14:29,0 --> 00:14:29,0
men; for they will not search

48
00:14:29,0 --> 00:14:29,0
knowledge, nor understand

49
00:14:29,0 --> 00:14:29,0
great knowledge, when it is

50
00:14:29,0 --> 00:14:29,0
given unto them in

51
00:14:29,0 --> 00:15:59,
plainness, even as plain as word can be.

52
00:15:59,0 --> 00:15:59,0
8 And now, my beloved

53
00:15:59,0 --> 00:15:59,0
brethren, I perceive that ye

54
00:15:59,0 --> 00:15:59,0
ponder still in your

55
00:15:59,0 --> 00:15:59,0
hearts; and it grieveth me

56
00:15:59,0 --> 00:15:59,0
that I must speak

57
00:15:59,0 --> 00:15:59,0
concerning this thing. For if ye

58
00:15:59,0 --> 00:15:59,0
would hearken unto the

59
00:15:59,0 --> 00:15:59,0
Spirit which teacheth a man

60
00:15:59,0 --> 00:15:59,0
to pray, ye would know

61
00:15:59,0 --> 00:15:59,0
that ye must pray; for the

62
00:15:59,0 --> 00:15:59,0
evil spirit teacheth not

63
00:15:59,0 --> 00:15:59,0
a man to pray, but

64
00:15:59,0 --> 00:15:31,
teacheth him that he must not pray.

65
00:15:31,0 --> 00:15:31,0
9 But behold, I say

66
00:15:31,0 --> 00:15:31,0
unto you that ye must pray

67
00:15:31,0 --> 00:15:31,0
always, and not faint;

68
00:15:31,0 --> 00:15:31,0
that ye must not

69
00:15:31,0 --> 00:15:31,0
perform any thing unto the

70
00:15:31,0 --> 00:15:31,0
Lord save in the first

71
00:15:31,0 --> 00:15:31,0
place ye shall pray unto

72
00:15:31,0 --> 00:15:31,0
the Father in the name

73
00:15:31,0 --> 00:15:31,0
of Christ, that he

74
00:15:31,0 --> 00:15:31,0
will consecrate thy

75
00:15:31,0 --> 00:15:31,0
performance unto thee, that

76
00:15:31,0 --> 00:15:31,0
thy performance may be

77
00:15:31,0 --> 00:15:17,
for the welfare of thy soul.
