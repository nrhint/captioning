00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:02,333
Chapter 32 Angels speak by the power of the

2
00:00:02,333 --> 00:00:04,666
Holy Ghost—Men must pray and gain knowledge for

3
00:00:04,666 --> 00:00:07,04
themselves from the Holy Ghost. About 559–545 B.C. 

4
00:00:07,04 --> 00:00:07,24
1 And now, behold, my beloved brethren, I

5
00:00:07,24 --> 00:00:07,44
suppose that ye ponder somewhat in your

6
00:00:07,44 --> 00:00:07,64
hearts concerning that which ye should do after

7
00:00:07,64 --> 00:00:07,84
ye have entered in by the way. But,

8
00:00:07,84 --> 00:00:08,976
behold, why do ye ponder these things in your hearts?

9
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:08,976
2 Do ye not remember that I said unto you

10
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:08,976
that after ye had received the Holy Ghost

11
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:08,976
ye could speak with the tongue of angels?

12
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:08,976
And now, how could ye speak with the

13
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:08,041
tongue of angels save it were by the Holy Ghost?

14
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:08,541
3 Angels speak by the power of the

15
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:09,041
Holy Ghost; wherefore, they speak the

16
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:09,541
words of Christ. Wherefore, I said

17
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:10,041
unto you, feast upon the words of

18
00:00:10,041 --> 00:00:10,541
Christ; for behold, the words of Christ

19
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:11,511
will tell you all things what ye should do.

20
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:12,011
4 Wherefore, now after I have

21
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:12,511
spoken these words, if ye cannot

22
00:00:12,511 --> 00:00:13,011
understand them it will be because ye

23
00:00:13,011 --> 00:00:13,511
ask not, neither do ye knock;

24
00:00:13,511 --> 00:00:14,011
wherefore, ye are not brought into the

25
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:14,982
light, but must perish in the dark.

26
00:00:14,982 --> 00:00:18,182
5 For behold, again I say unto

27
00:00:18,182 --> 00:00:21,382
you that if ye will enter in

28
00:00:21,382 --> 00:00:24,582
by the way, and receive the

29
00:00:24,582 --> 00:00:27,782
Holy Ghost, it will show unto

30
00:00:27,782 --> 00:00:30,898
you all things what ye should do.

31
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:30,898
6 Behold, this is the

32
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:30,898
doctrine of Christ, and there will

33
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:30,898
be no more doctrine given

34
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:30,898
until after he shall manifest

35
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:30,898
himself unto you in the flesh.

36
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:30,898
And when he shall manifest

37
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:30,898
himself unto you in the flesh,

38
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:30,898
the things which he shall say

39
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:30,43
unto you shall ye observe to do.

40
00:00:30,43 --> 00:00:30,347
7 And now I, Nephi, cannot

41
00:00:30,347 --> 00:00:30,264
say more; the Spirit

42
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:30,181
stoppeth mine utterance, and I am

43
00:00:30,181 --> 00:00:30,098
left to mourn because of

44
00:00:30,098 --> 00:00:30,015
the unbelief, and the

45
00:00:30,015 --> 00:00:29,932
wickedness, and the ignorance,

46
00:00:29,932 --> 00:00:29,849
and the stiffneckedness of

47
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:29,766
men; for they will not search

48
00:00:29,766 --> 00:00:29,683
knowledge, nor understand

49
00:00:29,683 --> 00:00:29,6
great knowledge, when it is

50
00:00:29,6 --> 00:00:29,517
given unto them in

51
00:00:29,517 --> 00:00:29,496
plainness, even as plain as word can be.

52
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:29,727
8 And now, my beloved

53
00:00:29,727 --> 00:00:29,958
brethren, I perceive that ye

54
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:30,189
ponder still in your

55
00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:30,42
hearts; and it grieveth me

56
00:00:30,42 --> 00:00:30,651
that I must speak

57
00:00:30,651 --> 00:00:30,882
concerning this thing. For if ye

58
00:00:30,882 --> 00:00:31,113
would hearken unto the

59
00:00:31,113 --> 00:00:31,344
Spirit which teacheth a man

60
00:00:31,344 --> 00:00:31,575
to pray, ye would know

61
00:00:31,575 --> 00:00:31,806
that ye must pray; for the

62
00:00:31,806 --> 00:00:32,037
evil spirit teacheth not

63
00:00:32,037 --> 00:00:32,268
a man to pray, but

64
00:00:32,268 --> 00:00:32,966
teacheth him that he must not pray.

65
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:32,966
9 But behold, I say

66
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:32,966
unto you that ye must pray

67
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:32,966
always, and not faint;

68
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:32,966
that ye must not

69
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:32,966
perform any thing unto the

70
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:32,966
Lord save in the first

71
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:32,966
place ye shall pray unto

72
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:32,966
the Father in the name

73
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:32,966
of Christ, that he

74
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:32,966
will consecrate thy

75
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:32,966
performance unto thee, that

76
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:32,966
thy performance may be

77
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:32,032
for the welfare of thy soul.
