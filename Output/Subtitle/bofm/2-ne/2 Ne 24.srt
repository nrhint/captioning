00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,75
Chapter 24 Israel will be gathered and will enjoy

2
00:00:01,75 --> 00:00:03,5
 millennial rest—Lucifer was cast out of heaven for

3
00:00:03,5 --> 00:00:05,25
 rebellion—Israel will triumph over Babylon (the

4
00:00:05,25 --> 00:00:07,0
 world)—Compare 
Isaiah 14. About 559–545 B.C.

5
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:11,975
1 For the Lord will have mercy on Jacob, and will

6
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:15,975
 yet choose Israel, and set them in their own land;

7
00:00:15,975 --> 00:00:19,975
 and the strangers shall be joined with them, and

8
00:00:19,975 --> 00:00:23,975
 they shall cleave to the house of Jacob

9
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:24,924
2 And the people shall take them and bring them to

10
00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:25,924
 their place; yea, from far unto the ends of the

11
00:00:25,924 --> 00:00:26,924
 earth; and they shall return to their lands of

12
00:00:26,924 --> 00:00:27,924
 promise. And the house of Israel shall possess them,

13
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:28,924
 and the land of the Lord shall be for servants and

14
00:00:28,924 --> 00:00:29,924
 handmaids; and they shall take them captives unto

15
00:00:29,924 --> 00:00:30,924
 whom they were captives; and they shall rule over

16
00:00:30,924 --> 00:00:31,924
 their oppressors

17
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,899
3 And it shall come to pass in that day that the

18
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,899
 Lord shall give thee rest, from thy sorrow, and

19
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:37,899
 from thy fear, and from the hard bondage wherein thou

20
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:39,899
 wast made to serve

21
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,873
4 And it shall come to pass in that day, that thou

22
00:00:41,873 --> 00:00:43,873
 shalt take up this proverb against the king of

23
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:45,873
 Babylon, and say: How hath the oppressor ceased, the

24
00:00:45,873 --> 00:00:47,873
 golden city ceased

25
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:51,848
5 The Lord hath broken the staff of the wicked,

26
00:00:51,848 --> 00:00:55,848
 the scepters of the rulers

27
00:00:55,822 --> 00:01:01,155
6 He who smote the people in wrath with a

28
00:01:01,155 --> 00:01:06,488
 continual stroke, he that ruled the nations in anger, is

29
00:01:06,488 --> 00:01:11,821
 persecuted, and none hindereth

30
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:15,772
7 The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet; they

31
00:01:15,772 --> 00:01:19,772
 break forth into singing

32
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,413
8 Yea, the fir trees rejoice at thee, and also the

33
00:01:22,413 --> 00:01:25,08
 cedars of Lebanon, saying: Since thou art laid

34
00:01:25,08 --> 00:01:27,747
 down no feller is come up against us

35
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:29,321
9 Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee

36
00:01:29,321 --> 00:01:30,921
 at thy coming; it stirreth up the dead for thee,

37
00:01:30,921 --> 00:01:32,521
 even all the chief ones of the earth; it hath

38
00:01:32,521 --> 00:01:34,121
 raised up from their thrones all the kings of the

39
00:01:34,121 --> 00:01:35,721
 nations

40
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:38,363
10 All they shall speak and say unto thee: Art

41
00:01:38,363 --> 00:01:41,03
 thou also become weak as we? Art thou become like

42
00:01:41,03 --> 00:01:43,697
 unto us

43
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:46,337
11 Thy pomp is brought down to the grave; the

44
00:01:46,337 --> 00:01:49,004
 noise of thy viols is not heard; the worm is spread

45
00:01:49,004 --> 00:01:51,671
 under thee, and the worms cover thee

46
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:54,312
12 How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son

47
00:01:54,312 --> 00:01:56,979
 of the morning! Art thou cut down to the ground,

48
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:59,646
 which did weaken the nations

49
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:01,62
13 For thou hast said in thy heart: I will ascend

50
00:02:01,62 --> 00:02:03,62
 into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the

51
00:02:03,62 --> 00:02:05,62
 stars of God; I will sit also upon the mount of the

52
00:02:05,62 --> 00:02:07,62
 congregation, in the sides of the north

53
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:15,594
14 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds;

54
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:23,594
 I will be like the Most High

55
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:27,543
15 Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the

56
00:02:27,543 --> 00:02:31,543
 sides of the pit

57
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,518
16 They that see thee shall narrowly look upon

58
00:02:33,518 --> 00:02:35,518
 thee, and shall consider thee, and shall say: Is this

59
00:02:35,518 --> 00:02:37,518
 the man that made the earth to tremble, that did

60
00:02:37,518 --> 00:02:39,518
 shake kingdoms

61
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:42,16
17 And made the world as a wilderness, and

62
00:02:42,16 --> 00:02:44,827
 destroyed the cities thereof, and opened not the house of

63
00:02:44,827 --> 00:02:47,494
 his prisoners

64
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:55,467
18 All the kings of the nations, yea, all of them,

65
00:02:55,467 --> 00:03:03,467
 lie in glory, every one of them in his own house

66
00:03:03,467 --> 00:03:11,467


67
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:17,791
19 But thou art cast out of thy grave like an

68
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:24,191
 abominable branch, and the remnant of those that are

69
00:03:24,191 --> 00:03:30,591
 slain, thrust through with a sword, that go down to

70
00:03:30,591 --> 00:03:36,991
 the stones of the pit; as a carcass trodden under

71
00:03:36,991 --> 00:03:43,391
 feet

72
00:03:43,29 --> 00:03:45,29
20 Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial,

73
00:03:45,29 --> 00:03:47,29
 because thou hast destroyed thy land and slain thy

74
00:03:47,29 --> 00:03:49,29
 people; the seed of evil-doers shall never be

75
00:03:49,29 --> 00:03:51,29
 renowned

76
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,264
21 Prepare slaughter for his children for the

77
00:03:53,264 --> 00:03:55,264
 iniquities of their fathers, that they do not rise,

78
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,264
 nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world

79
00:03:57,264 --> 00:03:59,264
 with cities

80
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:17,906
22 For I will rise up against them, saith the Lord

81
00:04:17,906 --> 00:04:36,573
 of Hosts, and cut off from Babylon the name, and

82
00:04:36,573 --> 00:04:55,24
 remnant, and son, and nephew, saith the Lord

83
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,728
23 I will also make it a possession for the

84
00:04:57,728 --> 00:05:00,395
 bittern, and pools of water; and I will sweep it with

85
00:05:00,395 --> 00:05:03,062
 the besom of destruction, saith the Lord of Hosts

86
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,703
24 The Lord of Hosts hath sworn, saying: Surely as

87
00:05:05,703 --> 00:05:08,37
 I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as

88
00:05:08,37 --> 00:05:11,037
 I have purposed, so shall it stand

89
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:18,761
25 That I will bring the Assyrian in my land, and

90
00:05:18,761 --> 00:05:26,511
 upon my mountains tread him under foot; then shall

91
00:05:26,511 --> 00:05:34,261
 his yoke depart from off them, and his burden

92
00:05:34,261 --> 00:05:42,011
 depart from off their shoulders

93
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:48,242
26 This is the purpose that is purposed upon the

94
00:05:48,242 --> 00:05:53,575
 whole earth; and this is the hand that is stretched

95
00:05:53,575 --> 00:05:58,908
 out upon all nations

96
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:04,192
27 For the Lord of Hosts hath purposed, and who

97
00:06:04,192 --> 00:06:09,524
 shall disannul? And his hand is stretched out, and

98
00:06:09,524 --> 00:06:14,858
 who shall turn it back

99
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:18,808
28 In the year that king Ahaz died was this

100
00:06:18,808 --> 00:06:22,808
 burden

101
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:26,782
29 Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina, because the

102
00:06:26,782 --> 00:06:30,782
 rod of him that smote thee is broken; for out of

103
00:06:30,782 --> 00:06:34,782
 the serpent’s root shall come forth a cockatrice,

104
00:06:34,782 --> 00:06:38,782
 and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent

105
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,732
30 And the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and

106
00:06:40,732 --> 00:06:42,732
 the needy shall lie down in safety; and I will kill

107
00:06:42,732 --> 00:06:44,732
 thy root with famine, and he shall slay thy

108
00:06:44,732 --> 00:06:46,732
 remnant

109
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:50,706
31 Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou, whole

110
00:06:50,706 --> 00:06:54,706
 Palestina, art dissolved; for there shall come from the

111
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:58,706
 north a smoke, and none shall be alone in his

112
00:06:58,706 --> 00:07:02,706
 appointed times

113
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:02,989
32 What shall then answer the messengers of the

114
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:03,322
 nations? That the Lord hath founded Zion, and the

115
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:03,655
 poor of his people shall trust in it.
