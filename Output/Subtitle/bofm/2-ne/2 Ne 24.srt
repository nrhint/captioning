00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 24 Israel will be gathered and will

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
enjoy millennial rest—Lucifer was cast out of heaven

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
for rebellion—Israel will triumph over Babylon

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:11:42,
(the world)—Compare 
Isaiah 14. About 559–545 B.C. 

5
00:11:42,0 --> 00:11:42,0
1 For the Lord will have mercy on Jacob, and

6
00:11:42,0 --> 00:11:42,0
will yet choose Israel, and set them in their own

7
00:11:42,0 --> 00:11:42,0
land; and the strangers shall be joined with

8
00:11:42,0 --> 00:15:12,
them, and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob.

9
00:15:12,0 --> 00:15:12,0
2 And the people shall take them and bring

10
00:15:12,0 --> 00:15:12,0
them to their place; yea, from far unto the

11
00:15:12,0 --> 00:15:12,0
ends of the earth; and they shall return to

12
00:15:12,0 --> 00:15:12,0
their lands of promise. And the house of Israel

13
00:15:12,0 --> 00:15:12,0
shall possess them, and the land of the Lord

14
00:15:12,0 --> 00:15:12,0
shall be for servants and handmaids; and they

15
00:15:12,0 --> 00:15:12,0
shall take them captives unto whom they were

16
00:15:12,0 --> 00:15:56,
captives; and they shall rule over their oppressors.

17
00:15:56,0 --> 00:15:56,0
3 And it shall come to pass in that day

18
00:15:56,0 --> 00:15:56,0
that the Lord shall give thee rest, from thy

19
00:15:56,0 --> 00:15:56,0
sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the

20
00:15:56,0 --> 00:24:24,
hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve.

21
00:24:24,0 --> 00:24:24,0
4 And it shall come to pass in

22
00:24:24,0 --> 00:24:24,0
that day, that thou shalt take up

23
00:24:24,0 --> 00:24:24,0
this proverb against the king of

24
00:24:24,0 --> 00:24:24,0
Babylon, and say: How hath the

25
00:24:24,0 --> 00:23:56,
oppressor ceased, the golden city ceased!

26
00:23:56,0 --> 00:23:56,0
5 The Lord hath broken

27
00:23:56,0 --> 00:23:56,0
the staff of the wicked,

28
00:23:56,0 --> 00:23:28,
the scepters of the rulers.

29
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
6 He who smote the

30
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
people in wrath with a

31
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
continual stroke, he

32
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
that ruled the

33
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
nations in anger, is

34
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,
persecuted, and none hindereth.

35
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
7 The whole earth

36
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
is at rest, and is

37
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
quiet; they break

38
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,
forth into singing.

39
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
8 Yea, the fir

40
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
trees rejoice at

41
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
thee, and also

42
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
the cedars of

43
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
Lebanon, saying:

44
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
Since thou art

45
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
laid down no feller

46
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,
is come up against us.

47
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
9 Hell from

48
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
beneath is moved

49
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
for thee to meet

50
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
thee at thy

51
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
coming; it

52
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
stirreth up the dead

53
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
for thee, even

54
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
all the chief

55
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
ones of the

56
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
earth; it hath

57
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
raised up from

58
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
their thrones all

59
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,
the kings of the nations.

60
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
10 All they

61
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
shall speak and

62
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
say unto thee:

63
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
Art thou also

64
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
become weak as we?

65
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
Art thou

66
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,
become like unto us?

67
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
11 Thy pomp is

68
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
brought down to

69
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
the grave; the

70
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
noise of thy

71
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
viols is not

72
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
heard; the worm is

73
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
spread under

74
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
thee, and the

75
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,
worms cover thee.

76
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
12 How art

77
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
thou fallen from

78
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
heaven, O

79
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
Lucifer, son of

80
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
the morning! Art

81
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
thou cut down

82
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
to the

83
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
ground, which did

84
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,
weaken the nations!

85
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
13 For thou

86
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
hast said in

87
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
thy heart: I

88
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
will ascend

89
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
into heaven, I

90
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
will exalt my

91
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
throne above

92
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
the stars of

93
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
God; I will

94
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
sit also upon

95
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
the mount of

96
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
the

97
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
congregation, in the

98
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,
sides of the north;

99
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
14 I will

100
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
ascend above

101
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
the

102
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
heights of the

103
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
clouds; I

104
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
will be like

105
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,
the Most High.

106
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
15 Yet

107
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
thou shalt

108
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
be

109
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
brought down to

110
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
hell, to

111
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
the

112
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,
sides of the pit.

113
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
16 They

114
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
that see

115
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
thee

116
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
shall

117
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
narrowly

118
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
look upon

119
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
thee, and

120
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
shall

121
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
consider

122
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
thee,

123
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
and shall

124
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
say: Is

125
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
this the

126
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
man

127
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
that made

128
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
the earth

129
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
to

130
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
tremble,

131
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,
that did shake kingdoms?

132
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
17 And

133
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
made

134
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
the world

135
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
as a

136
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0


137
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
wilderness, and

138
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0


139
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
destroyed the

140
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
cities

141
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0


142
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
thereof, and

143
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
opened

144
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
not the

145
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
house

146
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,
of his prisoners?

147
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
18 All

148
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
the

149
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
kings

150
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
of the

151
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0


152
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
nations,

153
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
yea, all

154
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
of

155
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
them, lie

156
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
in

157
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
glory,

158
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
every

159
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
one of

160
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
them

161
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,
in his own house.

162
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
19

163
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
But

164
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
thou art

165
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
cast

166
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
out

167
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
of

168
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
thy

169
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
grave

170
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
like an

171
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0


172
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0


173
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
abominable

174
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
branch,

175
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
and

176
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
the

177
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
remnant

178
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
of

179
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
those

180
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
that

181
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
are

182
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
slain,

183
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0


184
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
thrust

185
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
through

186
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
with

187
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
a

188
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
sword,

189
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
that

190
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
go

191
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
down to

192
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
the

193
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0


194
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
stones of

195
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
the

196
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,
pit; as a carcass trodden under feet.

197
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
20

198
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
Thou

199
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
shalt

200
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
not be

201
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0


202
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
joined

203
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
with

204
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
them in

00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
burial,

207
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0


208
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
because

209
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
thou

210
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
hast

211
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0


212
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
destroyed thy

213
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
land

214
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
and

215
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
slain

216
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
thy

217
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0


218
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
people;

219
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
the

220
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0

00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0


222
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
evil-doers

223
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0


224
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
shall

never be

226
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0


227
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,

228
00:23:28,0 --> 00:23:28,0
21

229
