1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,75
Chapter 24 Israel will be gathered and will

2
00:00:01,75 --> 00:00:03,5
enjoy millennial rest—Lucifer was cast out of heaven

3
00:00:03,5 --> 00:00:05,25
for rebellion—Israel will triumph over Babylon

4
00:00:05,25 --> 00:00:07,508
(the world)—Compare 
Isaiah 14. About 559–545 B.C. 

5
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:16,008
1 For the Lord will have mercy on Jacob, and

6
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:24,508
will yet choose Israel, and set them in their own

7
00:00:24,508 --> 00:00:33,008
land; and the strangers shall be joined with

8
00:00:33,008 --> 00:00:41,775
them, and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob.

9
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:42,9
2 And the people shall take them and bring

10
00:00:42,9 --> 00:00:44,025
them to their place; yea, from far unto the

11
00:00:44,025 --> 00:00:45,15
ends of the earth; and they shall return to

12
00:00:45,15 --> 00:00:46,275
their lands of promise. And the house of Israel

13
00:00:46,275 --> 00:00:47,4
shall possess them, and the land of the Lord

14
00:00:47,4 --> 00:00:48,525
shall be for servants and handmaids; and they

15
00:00:48,525 --> 00:00:49,65
shall take them captives unto whom they were

16
00:00:49,65 --> 00:00:50,217
captives; and they shall rule over their oppressors.

17
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:53,217
3 And it shall come to pass in that day

18
00:00:53,217 --> 00:00:56,217
that the Lord shall give thee rest, from thy

19
00:00:56,217 --> 00:00:59,217
sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the

20
00:00:59,217 --> 00:01:02,596
hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve.

21
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:05,996
4 And it shall come to pass in

22
00:01:05,996 --> 00:01:09,396
that day, that thou shalt take up

23
00:01:09,396 --> 00:01:12,796
this proverb against the king of

24
00:01:12,796 --> 00:01:16,196
Babylon, and say: How hath the

25
00:01:16,196 --> 00:01:19,012
oppressor ceased, the golden city ceased!

26
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:26,345
5 The Lord hath broken

27
00:01:26,345 --> 00:01:33,678
the staff of the wicked,

28
00:01:33,678 --> 00:01:41,268
the scepters of the rulers.

29
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:41,768
6 He who smote the

30
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:42,268
people in wrath with a

31
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:42,768
continual stroke, he

32
00:01:42,768 --> 00:01:43,268
that ruled the

33
00:01:43,268 --> 00:01:43,768
nations in anger, is

34
00:01:43,768 --> 00:01:44,738
persecuted, and none hindereth.

35
00:01:44,738 --> 00:01:46,488
7 The whole earth

36
00:01:46,488 --> 00:01:48,238
is at rest, and is

37
00:01:48,238 --> 00:01:49,988
quiet; they break

38
00:01:49,988 --> 00:01:51,778
forth into singing.

39
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:52,903
8 Yea, the fir

40
00:01:52,903 --> 00:01:54,028
trees rejoice at

41
00:01:54,028 --> 00:01:55,153
thee, and also

42
00:01:55,153 --> 00:01:56,278
the cedars of

43
00:01:56,278 --> 00:01:57,403
Lebanon, saying:

44
00:01:57,403 --> 00:01:58,528
Since thou art

45
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,653
laid down no feller

46
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:00,22
is come up against us.

47
00:02:00,22 --> 00:02:00,989
9 Hell from

48
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:01,758
beneath is moved

49
00:02:01,758 --> 00:02:02,527
for thee to meet

50
00:02:02,527 --> 00:02:03,296
thee at thy

51
00:02:03,296 --> 00:02:04,065
coming; it

52
00:02:04,065 --> 00:02:04,834
stirreth up the dead

53
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:05,603
for thee, even

54
00:02:05,603 --> 00:02:06,372
all the chief

55
00:02:06,372 --> 00:02:07,141
ones of the

56
00:02:07,141 --> 00:02:07,91
earth; it hath

57
00:02:07,91 --> 00:02:08,679
raised up from

58
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:09,448
their thrones all

59
00:02:09,448 --> 00:02:10,13
the kings of the nations.

60
00:02:10,13 --> 00:02:10,559
10 All they

61
00:02:10,559 --> 00:02:10,988
shall speak and

62
00:02:10,988 --> 00:02:11,417
say unto thee:

63
00:02:11,417 --> 00:02:11,846
Art thou also

64
00:02:11,846 --> 00:02:12,275
become weak as we?

65
00:02:12,275 --> 00:02:12,704
Art thou

66
00:02:12,704 --> 00:02:13,6
become like unto us?

67
00:02:13,6 --> 00:02:14,378
11 Thy pomp is

68
00:02:14,378 --> 00:02:15,156
brought down to

69
00:02:15,156 --> 00:02:15,934
the grave; the

70
00:02:15,934 --> 00:02:16,712
noise of thy

71
00:02:16,712 --> 00:02:17,49
viols is not

72
00:02:17,49 --> 00:02:18,268
heard; the worm is

73
00:02:18,268 --> 00:02:19,046
spread under

74
00:02:19,046 --> 00:02:19,824
thee, and the

75
00:02:19,824 --> 00:02:20,641
worms cover thee.

76
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:21,084
12 How art

77
00:02:21,084 --> 00:02:21,529
thou fallen from

78
00:02:21,529 --> 00:02:21,972
heaven, O

79
00:02:21,972 --> 00:02:22,417
Lucifer, son of

80
00:02:22,417 --> 00:02:22,861
the morning! Art

81
00:02:22,861 --> 00:02:23,304
thou cut down

82
00:02:23,304 --> 00:02:23,749
to the

83
00:02:23,749 --> 00:02:24,192
ground, which did

84
00:02:24,192 --> 00:02:24,111
weaken the nations!

85
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:24,04
13 For thou

86
00:02:24,04 --> 00:02:23,969
hast said in

87
00:02:23,969 --> 00:02:23,898
thy heart: I

88
00:02:23,898 --> 00:02:23,827
will ascend

89
00:02:23,827 --> 00:02:23,756
into heaven, I

90
00:02:23,756 --> 00:02:23,685
will exalt my

91
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:23,614
throne above

92
00:02:23,614 --> 00:02:23,543
the stars of

93
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:23,472
God; I will

94
00:02:23,472 --> 00:02:23,401
sit also upon

95
00:02:23,401 --> 00:02:23,33
the mount of

96
00:02:23,33 --> 00:02:23,259
the

97
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:23,188
congregation, in the

98
00:02:23,188 --> 00:02:23,176
sides of the north;

99
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:24,176
14 I will

100
00:02:24,176 --> 00:02:25,176
ascend above

101
00:02:25,176 --> 00:02:26,176
the

102
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,176
heights of the

103
00:02:27,176 --> 00:02:28,176
clouds; I

104
00:02:28,176 --> 00:02:29,176
will be like

105
00:02:29,176 --> 00:02:30,217
the Most High.

106
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:30,646
15 Yet

107
00:02:30,646 --> 00:02:31,075
thou shalt

108
00:02:31,075 --> 00:02:31,504
be

109
00:02:31,504 --> 00:02:31,933
brought down to

110
00:02:31,933 --> 00:02:32,362
hell, to

111
00:02:32,362 --> 00:02:32,791
the

112
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:33,22
sides of the pit.

113
00:02:33,22 --> 00:02:33,167
16 They

114
00:02:33,167 --> 00:02:33,114
that see

115
00:02:33,114 --> 00:02:33,061
thee

116
00:02:33,061 --> 00:02:33,008
shall

117
00:02:33,008 --> 00:02:32,955
narrowly

118
00:02:32,955 --> 00:02:32,902
look upon

119
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:32,849
thee, and

120
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:32,796
shall

121
00:02:32,796 --> 00:02:32,743
consider

122
00:02:32,743 --> 00:02:32,69
thee,

123
00:02:32,69 --> 00:02:32,637
and shall

124
00:02:32,637 --> 00:02:32,584
say: Is

125
00:02:32,584 --> 00:02:32,531
this the

126
00:02:32,531 --> 00:02:32,478
man

127
00:02:32,478 --> 00:02:32,425
that made

128
00:02:32,425 --> 00:02:32,372
the earth

129
00:02:32,372 --> 00:02:32,319
to

130
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:32,266
tremble,

131
00:02:32,266 --> 00:02:32,285
that did shake kingdoms?

132
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:32,485
17 And

133
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:32,685
made

134
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:32,885
the world

135
00:02:32,885 --> 00:02:33,085
as a

136
00:02:33,085 --> 00:02:33,285


137
00:02:33,285 --> 00:02:33,485
wilderness, and

138
00:02:33,485 --> 00:02:33,685


139
00:02:33,685 --> 00:02:33,885
destroyed the

140
00:02:33,885 --> 00:02:34,085
cities

141
00:02:34,085 --> 00:02:34,285


142
00:02:34,285 --> 00:02:34,485
thereof, and

143
00:02:34,485 --> 00:02:34,685
opened

144
00:02:34,685 --> 00:02:34,885
not the

145
00:02:34,885 --> 00:02:35,085
house

146
00:02:35,085 --> 00:02:35,288
of his prisoners?

147
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:35,221
18 All

148
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:35,154
the

149
00:02:35,154 --> 00:02:35,087
kings

150
00:02:35,087 --> 00:02:35,02
of the

151
00:02:35,02 --> 00:02:34,953


152
00:02:34,953 --> 00:02:34,886
nations,

153
00:02:34,886 --> 00:02:34,819
yea, all

154
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:34,752
of

155
00:02:34,752 --> 00:02:34,685
them, lie

156
00:02:34,685 --> 00:02:34,618
in

157
00:02:34,618 --> 00:02:34,551
glory,

158
00:02:34,551 --> 00:02:34,484
every

159
00:02:34,484 --> 00:02:34,417
one of

160
00:02:34,417 --> 00:02:34,35
them

161
00:02:34,35 --> 00:02:34,354
in his own house.

162
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:34,325
19

163
00:02:34,325 --> 00:02:34,296
But

164
00:02:34,296 --> 00:02:34,267
thou art

165
00:02:34,267 --> 00:02:34,238
cast

166
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:34,209
out

167
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:34,18
of

168
00:02:34,18 --> 00:02:34,151
thy

169
00:02:34,151 --> 00:02:34,122
grave

170
00:02:34,122 --> 00:02:34,093
like an

171
00:02:34,093 --> 00:02:34,064


172
00:02:34,064 --> 00:02:34,035


173
00:02:34,035 --> 00:02:34,006
abominable

174
00:02:34,006 --> 00:02:33,977
branch,

175
00:02:33,977 --> 00:02:33,948
and

176
00:02:33,948 --> 00:02:33,919
the

177
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:33,89
remnant

178
00:02:33,89 --> 00:02:33,861
of

179
00:02:33,861 --> 00:02:33,832
those

180
00:02:33,832 --> 00:02:33,803
that

181
00:02:33,803 --> 00:02:33,774
are

182
00:02:33,774 --> 00:02:33,745
slain,

183
00:02:33,745 --> 00:02:33,716


184
00:02:33,716 --> 00:02:33,687
thrust

185
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:33,658
through

186
00:02:33,658 --> 00:02:33,629
with

187
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:33,6
a

188
00:02:33,6 --> 00:02:33,571
sword,

189
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:33,542
that

190
00:02:33,542 --> 00:02:33,513
go

191
00:02:33,513 --> 00:02:33,484
down to

192
00:02:33,484 --> 00:02:33,455
the

193
00:02:33,455 --> 00:02:33,426


194
00:02:33,426 --> 00:02:33,397
stones of

195
00:02:33,397 --> 00:02:33,368
the

196
00:02:33,368 --> 00:02:33,42
pit; as a carcass trodden under feet.

197
00:02:33,42 --> 00:02:33,517
20

198
00:02:33,517 --> 00:02:33,614
Thou

199
00:02:33,614 --> 00:02:33,711
shalt

200
00:02:33,711 --> 00:02:33,808
not be

00:02:33,808 --> 00:02:33,905


202
00:02:33,905 --> 00:02:34,002
joined

203
00:02:34,002 --> 00:02:34,099
with

204
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:34,196
