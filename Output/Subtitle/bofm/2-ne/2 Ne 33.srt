1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,75
Chapter 33 Nephi’s words are true—They testify of

2
00:00:01,75 --> 00:00:03,5
 Christ—Those who believe in Christ will believe

3
00:00:03,5 --> 00:00:05,25
 Nephi’s words, which will stand as a witness before

4
00:00:05,25 --> 00:00:07,0
 the judgment bar. About 559–545 B.C.

5
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,308
1 And now I, Nephi, cannot write all the things

6
00:00:09,308 --> 00:00:10,641
 which were taught among my people; neither am I

7
00:00:10,641 --> 00:00:11,974
 mighty in writing, like unto speaking; for when a man

8
00:00:11,974 --> 00:00:13,307
 speaketh by the power of the Holy Ghost the power

9
00:00:13,307 --> 00:00:14,64
 of the Holy Ghost carrieth it unto the hearts of

10
00:00:14,64 --> 00:00:15,973
 the children of men

11
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,549
2 But behold, there are many that harden their

12
00:00:17,549 --> 00:00:19,149
 hearts against the Holy Spirit, that it hath no place

13
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:20,749
 in them; wherefore, they cast many things away

14
00:00:20,749 --> 00:00:22,349
 which are written and esteem them as things of

15
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:23,949
 naught

16
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,257
3 But I, Nephi, have written what I have written,

17
00:00:25,257 --> 00:00:26,59
 and I esteem it as of great worth, and especially

18
00:00:26,59 --> 00:00:27,923
 unto my people. For I pray continually for them by

19
00:00:27,923 --> 00:00:29,256
 day, and mine eyes water my pillow by night,

20
00:00:29,256 --> 00:00:30,589
 because of them; and I cry unto my God in faith, and I

21
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:31,922
 know that he will hear my cry

22
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:32,899
4 And I know that the Lord God will consecrate my

23
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:33,899
 prayers for the gain of my people. And the words

24
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:34,899
 which I have written in weakness will be made

25
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:35,899
 strong unto them; for it persuadeth them to do good; it

26
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:36,899
 maketh known unto them of their fathers; and it

27
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:37,899
 speaketh of Jesus, and persuadeth them to believe

28
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:38,899
 in him, and to endure to the end, which is life

29
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:39,899
 eternal

30
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:10,642
7 I have charity for my people, and great faith in

31
00:00:10,642 --> 00:00:13,309
 Christ that I shall meet many souls spotless at

32
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:15,976
 his judgment-seat

33
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:19,949
8 I have charity for the Jew—I say Jew, because I

34
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:23,949
 mean them from whence I came

35
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,257
9 I also have charity for the Gentiles. But

36
00:00:25,257 --> 00:00:26,59
 behold, for none of these can I hope except they shall

37
00:00:26,59 --> 00:00:27,923
 be reconciled unto Christ, and enter into the

38
00:00:27,923 --> 00:00:29,256
 narrow gate, and walk in the strait path which leads to

39
00:00:29,256 --> 00:00:30,589
 life, and continue in the path until the end of

40
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:31,922
 the day of probation

41
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:32,899
10 And now, my beloved brethren, and also Jew, and

42
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:33,899
 all ye ends of the earth, hearken unto these

43
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:34,899
 words and believe in Christ; and if ye believe not in

44
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:35,899
 these words believe in Christ. And if ye shall

45
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:36,899
 believe in Christ ye will believe in these words, for

46
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:37,899
 they are the words of Christ, and he hath given

47
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:38,899
 them unto me; and they teach all men that they

48
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:39,899
 should do good

49
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,575
13 And now, my beloved brethren, all those who are

50
00:00:09,575 --> 00:00:11,175
 of the house of Israel, and all ye ends of the

51
00:00:11,175 --> 00:00:12,775
 earth, I speak unto you as the voice of one crying

52
00:00:12,775 --> 00:00:14,375
 from the dust: Farewell until that great day shall

53
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:15,975
 come

54
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,282
14 And you that will not partake of the goodness

55
00:00:17,282 --> 00:00:18,615
 of God, and respect the words of the Jews, and also

56
00:00:18,615 --> 00:00:19,948
 my words, and the words which shall proceed forth

57
00:00:19,948 --> 00:00:21,281
 out of the mouth of the Lamb of God, behold, I

58
00:00:21,281 --> 00:00:22,614
 bid you an everlasting farewell, for these words

59
00:00:22,614 --> 00:00:23,947
 shall condemn you at the last day

60
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:26,591
15 For what I seal on earth, shall be brought

61
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:29,258
 against you at the judgment bar; for thus hath the

62
00:00:29,258 --> 00:00:31,925
 Lord commanded me, and I must obey. Amen.
