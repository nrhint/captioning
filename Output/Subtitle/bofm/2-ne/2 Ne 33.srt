1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 33 Nephi’s words are true—They testify

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of Christ—Those who believe in Christ will

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
believe Nephi’s words, which will stand as a

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:07:57,
witness before the judgment bar. About 559–545 B.C. 

5
00:07:57,0 --> 00:07:57,0
1 And now I, Nephi, cannot write all the

6
00:07:57,0 --> 00:07:57,0
things which were taught among my people;

7
00:07:57,0 --> 00:07:57,0
neither am I mighty in writing, like unto

8
00:07:57,0 --> 00:07:57,0
speaking; for when a man speaketh by the power of

9
00:07:57,0 --> 00:07:57,0
the Holy Ghost the power of the Holy Ghost

10
00:07:57,0 --> 00:09:27,
carrieth it unto the hearts of the children of men.

11
00:09:27,0 --> 00:09:27,0
2 But behold, there are many that harden

12
00:09:27,0 --> 00:09:27,0
their hearts against the Holy Spirit,

13
00:09:27,0 --> 00:09:27,0
that it hath no place in them; wherefore,

14
00:09:27,0 --> 00:09:27,0
they cast many things away which are

15
00:09:27,0 --> 00:12:58,
written and esteem them as things of naught.

16
00:12:58,0 --> 00:12:58,0
3 But I, Nephi, have written what I

17
00:12:58,0 --> 00:12:58,0
have written, and I esteem it as

18
00:12:58,0 --> 00:12:58,0
of great worth, and especially unto

19
00:12:58,0 --> 00:12:58,0
my people. For I pray continually

20
00:12:58,0 --> 00:12:58,0
for them by day, and mine eyes water

21
00:12:58,0 --> 00:12:58,0
my pillow by night, because of

22
00:12:58,0 --> 00:12:58,0
them; and I cry unto my God in faith,

23
00:12:58,0 --> 00:13:28,
and I know that he will hear my cry.

24
00:13:28,0 --> 00:13:28,0
4 And I know that the Lord God

25
00:13:28,0 --> 00:13:28,0
will consecrate my prayers for

26
00:13:28,0 --> 00:13:28,0
the gain of my people. And the

27
00:13:28,0 --> 00:13:28,0
words which I have written in

28
00:13:28,0 --> 00:13:28,0
weakness will be made strong unto

29
00:13:28,0 --> 00:13:28,0
them; for it persuadeth them to do

30
00:13:28,0 --> 00:13:28,0
good; it maketh known unto them

31
00:13:28,0 --> 00:13:28,0
of their fathers; and it

32
00:13:28,0 --> 00:13:28,0
speaketh of Jesus, and persuadeth them

33
00:13:28,0 --> 00:13:28,0
to believe in him, and to endure

34
00:13:28,0 --> 00:16:59,
to the end, which is life eternal.

35
00:16:59,0 --> 00:16:59,0
5 And it speaketh harshly

36
00:16:59,0 --> 00:16:59,0
against sin, according to the

37
00:16:59,0 --> 00:16:59,0
plainness of the truth; wherefore, no

38
00:16:59,0 --> 00:16:59,0
man will be angry at the words

39
00:16:59,0 --> 00:16:59,0
which I have written save he

40
00:16:59,0 --> 00:18:43,
shall be of the spirit of the devil.

41
00:18:43,0 --> 00:18:43,0
6 I glory in plainness; I

42
00:18:43,0 --> 00:18:43,0
glory in truth; I glory

43
00:18:43,0 --> 00:18:43,0
in my Jesus, for he hath

44
00:18:43,0 --> 00:22:14,
redeemed my soul from hell.

45
00:22:14,0 --> 00:22:14,0
7 I have charity for my

46
00:22:14,0 --> 00:22:14,0
people, and great

47
00:22:14,0 --> 00:22:14,0
faith in Christ that I

48
00:22:14,0 --> 00:22:14,0
shall meet many souls

49
00:22:14,0 --> 00:21:46,
spotless at his judgment-seat.

50
00:21:46,0 --> 00:21:46,0
8 I have charity

51
00:21:46,0 --> 00:21:46,0
for the Jew—I say

52
00:21:46,0 --> 00:21:46,0
Jew, because I mean

53
00:21:46,0 --> 00:21:18,
them from whence I came.

54
00:21:18,0 --> 00:21:18,0
9 I also have

55
00:21:18,0 --> 00:21:18,0
charity for the

56
00:21:18,0 --> 00:21:18,0
Gentiles. But behold,

57
00:21:18,0 --> 00:21:18,0
for none of these

58
00:21:18,0 --> 00:21:18,0
can I hope except

59
00:21:18,0 --> 00:21:18,0
they shall be

60
00:21:18,0 --> 00:21:18,0
reconciled unto Christ,

61
00:21:18,0 --> 00:21:18,0
and enter into the

62
00:21:18,0 --> 00:21:18,0
narrow gate, and

63
00:21:18,0 --> 00:21:18,0
walk in the strait

64
00:21:18,0 --> 00:21:18,0
path which leads

65
00:21:18,0 --> 00:21:18,0
to life, and

66
00:21:18,0 --> 00:21:18,0
continue in the path

67
00:21:18,0 --> 00:21:18,0
until the end of the

68
00:21:18,0 --> 00:20:50,
day of probation.

69
00:20:50,0 --> 00:20:50,0
10 And now, my

70
00:20:50,0 --> 00:20:50,0
beloved brethren,

71
00:20:50,0 --> 00:20:50,0
and also Jew, and

72
00:20:50,0 --> 00:20:50,0
all ye ends of

73
00:20:50,0 --> 00:20:50,0
the earth, hearken

74
00:20:50,0 --> 00:20:50,0
unto these words

75
00:20:50,0 --> 00:20:50,0
and believe in

76
00:20:50,0 --> 00:20:50,0
Christ; and if ye

77
00:20:50,0 --> 00:20:50,0
believe not in

78
00:20:50,0 --> 00:20:50,0
these words believe

79
00:20:50,0 --> 00:20:50,0
in Christ. And if

80
00:20:50,0 --> 00:20:50,0
ye shall believe

81
00:20:50,0 --> 00:20:50,0
in Christ ye

82
00:20:50,0 --> 00:20:50,0
will believe in

83
00:20:50,0 --> 00:20:50,0
these words, for they

84
00:20:50,0 --> 00:20:50,0
are the words of

85
00:20:50,0 --> 00:20:50,0
Christ, and he

86
00:20:50,0 --> 00:20:50,0
hath given them

87
00:20:50,0 --> 00:20:50,0
unto me; and they

88
00:20:50,0 --> 00:20:50,0
teach all men that

89
00:20:50,0 --> 00:20:36,
they should do good.

90
00:20:36,0 --> 00:20:36,0
11 And if they

91
00:20:36,0 --> 00:20:36,0
are not the words

92
00:20:36,0 --> 00:20:36,0
of Christ,

93
00:20:36,0 --> 00:20:36,0
judge ye—for Christ

94
00:20:36,0 --> 00:20:36,0
will show unto

95
00:20:36,0 --> 00:20:36,0
you, with power

96
00:20:36,0 --> 00:20:36,0
and great glory,

97
00:20:36,0 --> 00:20:36,0
that they are

98
00:20:36,0 --> 00:20:36,0
his words, at the

99
00:20:36,0 --> 00:20:36,0
last day; and

100
00:20:36,0 --> 00:20:36,0
you and I shall

101
00:20:36,0 --> 00:20:36,0
stand face to face

102
00:20:36,0 --> 00:20:36,0
before his bar;

103
00:20:36,0 --> 00:20:36,0
and ye shall

104
00:20:36,0 --> 00:20:36,0
know that I have

105
00:20:36,0 --> 00:20:36,0
been commanded of

106
00:20:36,0 --> 00:20:36,0
him to write

107
00:20:36,0 --> 00:20:36,0
these things,

108
00:20:36,0 --> 00:22:20,
notwithstanding my weakness.

109
00:22:20,0 --> 00:22:20,0
12 And I pray

110
00:22:20,0 --> 00:22:20,0
the Father in

111
00:22:20,0 --> 00:22:20,0
the name of

112
00:22:20,0 --> 00:22:20,0
Christ that many

113
00:22:20,0 --> 00:22:20,0
of us, if not

114
00:22:20,0 --> 00:22:20,0
all, may be

115
00:22:20,0 --> 00:22:20,0
saved in his

116
00:22:20,0 --> 00:22:20,0
kingdom at that

117
00:22:20,0 --> 00:21:52,
great and last day.

118
00:21:52,0 --> 00:21:52,0
13 And now,

119
00:21:52,0 --> 00:21:52,0
my beloved

120
00:21:52,0 --> 00:21:52,0
brethren, all

121
00:21:52,0 --> 00:21:52,0
those who are

122
00:21:52,0 --> 00:21:52,0
of the house

123
00:21:52,0 --> 00:21:52,0
of Israel, and

124
00:21:52,0 --> 00:21:52,0
all ye ends

125
00:21:52,0 --> 00:21:52,0
of the earth,

126
00:21:52,0 --> 00:21:52,0
I speak unto

127
00:21:52,0 --> 00:21:52,0
you as the

128
00:21:52,0 --> 00:21:52,0
voice of one

129
00:21:52,0 --> 00:21:52,0
crying from

130
00:21:52,0 --> 00:21:52,0
the dust:

131
00:21:52,0 --> 00:21:52,0
Farewell until

132
00:21:52,0 --> 00:24:04,
that great day shall come.

133
00:24:04,0 --> 00:24:04,0
14 And you

134
00:24:04,0 --> 00:24:04,0
that will not

135
00:24:04,0 --> 00:24:04,0
partake of

136
00:24:04,0 --> 00:24:04,0
the goodness

137
00:24:04,0 --> 00:24:04,0
of God, and

138
00:24:04,0 --> 00:24:04,0
respect the

139
00:24:04,0 --> 00:24:04,0
words of

140
00:24:04,0 --> 00:24:04,0
the Jews, and

141
00:24:04,0 --> 00:24:04,0
also my

142
00:24:04,0 --> 00:24:04,0
words, and the

143
00:24:04,0 --> 00:24:04,0
words which

144
00:24:04,0 --> 00:24:04,0
shall proceed

145
00:24:04,0 --> 00:24:04,0
forth out

146
00:24:04,0 --> 00:24:04,0
of the mouth

147
00:24:04,0 --> 00:24:04,0
of the Lamb

148
00:24:04,0 --> 00:24:04,0
of God,

149
00:24:04,0 --> 00:24:04,0
behold, I bid

150
00:24:04,0 --> 00:24:04,0
you an

151
00:24:04,0 --> 00:24:04,0
everlasting

152
00:24:04,0 --> 00:24:04,0
farewell, for these

153
00:24:04,0 --> 00:24:04,0
words shall

154
00:24:04,0 --> 00:27:35,
condemn you at the last day.

155
00:27:35,0 --> 00:27:35,0
15 For what

156
00:27:35,0 --> 00:27:35,0
I seal on

157
00:27:35,0 --> 00:27:35,0
earth,

158
00:27:35,0 --> 00:27:35,0
shall be

159
00:27:35,0 --> 00:27:35,0
brought against

160
00:27:35,0 --> 00:27:35,0
you at the

161
00:27:35,0 --> 00:27:35,0
judgment

162
00:27:35,0 --> 00:27:35,0
bar; for thus

163
00:27:35,0 --> 00:27:35,0
hath the

164
00:27:35,0 --> 00:27:35,0
Lord

165
00:27:35,0 --> 00:27:35,0
commanded me, and I

166
00:27:35,0 --> 00:36:02,
must obey. Amen.
