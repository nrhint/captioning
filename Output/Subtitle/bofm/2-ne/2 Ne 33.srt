1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,75
Chapter 33 Nephi’s words are true—They testify

2
00:00:01,75 --> 00:00:03,5
of Christ—Those who believe in Christ will

3
00:00:03,5 --> 00:00:05,25
believe Nephi’s words, which will stand as a

4
00:00:05,25 --> 00:00:07,04
witness before the judgment bar. About 559–545 B.C. 

5
00:00:07,04 --> 00:00:06,873
1 And now I, Nephi, cannot write all the

6
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:06,706
things which were taught among my people;

7
00:00:06,706 --> 00:00:06,539
neither am I mighty in writing, like unto

8
00:00:06,539 --> 00:00:06,372
speaking; for when a man speaketh by the power of

9
00:00:06,372 --> 00:00:06,205
the Holy Ghost the power of the Holy Ghost

10
00:00:06,205 --> 00:00:06,573
carrieth it unto the hearts of the children of men.

11
00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:09,973
2 But behold, there are many that harden

12
00:00:09,973 --> 00:00:13,373
their hearts against the Holy Spirit,

13
00:00:13,373 --> 00:00:16,773
that it hath no place in them; wherefore,

14
00:00:16,773 --> 00:00:20,173
they cast many things away which are

15
00:00:20,173 --> 00:00:23,49
written and esteem them as things of naught.

16
00:00:23,49 --> 00:00:25,615
3 But I, Nephi, have written what I

17
00:00:25,615 --> 00:00:27,74
have written, and I esteem it as

18
00:00:27,74 --> 00:00:29,865
of great worth, and especially unto

19
00:00:29,865 --> 00:00:31,99
my people. For I pray continually

20
00:00:31,99 --> 00:00:34,115
for them by day, and mine eyes water

21
00:00:34,115 --> 00:00:36,24
my pillow by night, because of

22
00:00:36,24 --> 00:00:38,365
them; and I cry unto my God in faith,

23
00:00:38,365 --> 00:00:40,407
and I know that he will hear my cry.

24
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:40,316
4 And I know that the Lord God

25
00:00:40,316 --> 00:00:40,225
will consecrate my prayers for

26
00:00:40,225 --> 00:00:40,134
the gain of my people. And the

27
00:00:40,134 --> 00:00:40,043
words which I have written in

28
00:00:40,043 --> 00:00:39,952
weakness will be made strong unto

29
00:00:39,952 --> 00:00:39,861
them; for it persuadeth them to do

30
00:00:39,861 --> 00:00:39,77
good; it maketh known unto them

31
00:00:39,77 --> 00:00:39,679
of their fathers; and it

32
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:39,588
speaketh of Jesus, and persuadeth them

33
00:00:39,588 --> 00:00:39,497
to believe in him, and to endure

34
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:39,94
to the end, which is life eternal.

35
00:00:39,94 --> 00:00:41,107
5 And it speaketh harshly

36
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:42,274
against sin, according to the

37
00:00:42,274 --> 00:00:43,441
plainness of the truth; wherefore, no

38
00:00:43,441 --> 00:00:44,608
man will be angry at the words

39
00:00:44,608 --> 00:00:45,775
which I have written save he

40
00:00:45,775 --> 00:00:46,98
shall be of the spirit of the devil.

41
00:00:46,98 --> 00:00:49,23
6 I glory in plainness; I

42
00:00:49,23 --> 00:00:51,48
glory in truth; I glory

43
00:00:51,48 --> 00:00:53,73
in my Jesus, for he hath

44
00:00:53,73 --> 00:00:55,956
redeemed my soul from hell.

45
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:59,556
7 I have charity for my

46
00:00:59,556 --> 00:01:03,156
people, and great

47
00:01:03,156 --> 00:01:06,756
faith in Christ that I

48
00:01:06,756 --> 00:01:10,356
shall meet many souls

49
00:01:10,356 --> 00:01:13,807
spotless at his judgment-seat.

50
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,557
8 I have charity

51
00:01:13,557 --> 00:01:13,307
for the Jew—I say

52
00:01:13,307 --> 00:01:13,057
Jew, because I mean

53
00:01:13,057 --> 00:01:12,873
them from whence I came.

54
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:13,473
9 I also have

55
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:14,073
charity for the

56
00:01:14,073 --> 00:01:14,673
Gentiles. But behold,

57
00:01:14,673 --> 00:01:15,273
for none of these

58
00:01:15,273 --> 00:01:15,873
can I hope except

59
00:01:15,873 --> 00:01:16,473
they shall be

60
00:01:16,473 --> 00:01:17,073
reconciled unto Christ,

61
00:01:17,073 --> 00:01:17,673
and enter into the

62
00:01:17,673 --> 00:01:18,273
narrow gate, and

63
00:01:18,273 --> 00:01:18,873
walk in the strait

64
00:01:18,873 --> 00:01:19,473
path which leads

65
00:01:19,473 --> 00:01:20,073
to life, and

66
00:01:20,073 --> 00:01:20,673
continue in the path

67
00:01:20,673 --> 00:01:21,273
until the end of the

68
00:01:21,273 --> 00:01:21,848
day of probation.

69
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:22,038
10 And now, my

70
00:01:22,038 --> 00:01:22,228
beloved brethren,

71
00:01:22,228 --> 00:01:22,418
and also Jew, and

72
00:01:22,418 --> 00:01:22,608
all ye ends of

73
00:01:22,608 --> 00:01:22,798
the earth, hearken

74
00:01:22,798 --> 00:01:22,988
unto these words

75
00:01:22,988 --> 00:01:23,178
and believe in

76
00:01:23,178 --> 00:01:23,368
Christ; and if ye

77
00:01:23,368 --> 00:01:23,558
believe not in

78
00:01:23,558 --> 00:01:23,748
these words believe

79
00:01:23,748 --> 00:01:23,938
in Christ. And if

80
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:24,128
ye shall believe

81
00:01:24,128 --> 00:01:24,318
in Christ ye

82
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:24,508
will believe in

83
00:01:24,508 --> 00:01:24,698
these words, for they

84
00:01:24,698 --> 00:01:24,888
are the words of

85
00:01:24,888 --> 00:01:25,078
Christ, and he

86
00:01:25,078 --> 00:01:25,268
hath given them

87
00:01:25,268 --> 00:01:25,458
unto me; and they

88
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:25,648
teach all men that

89
00:01:25,648 --> 00:01:25,319
they should do good.

90
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:25,687
11 And if they

91
00:01:25,687 --> 00:01:26,055
are not the words

92
00:01:26,055 --> 00:01:26,423
of Christ,

93
00:01:26,423 --> 00:01:26,791
judge ye—for Christ

94
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:27,159
will show unto

95
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:27,527
you, with power

96
00:01:27,527 --> 00:01:27,895
and great glory,

97
00:01:27,895 --> 00:01:28,263
that they are

98
00:01:28,263 --> 00:01:28,631
his words, at the

99
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:28,999
last day; and

100
00:01:28,999 --> 00:01:29,367
you and I shall

101
00:01:29,367 --> 00:01:29,735
stand face to face

102
00:01:29,735 --> 00:01:30,103
before his bar;

103
00:01:30,103 --> 00:01:30,471
and ye shall

104
00:01:30,471 --> 00:01:30,839
know that I have

105
00:01:30,839 --> 00:01:31,207
been commanded of

106
00:01:31,207 --> 00:01:31,575
him to write

107
00:01:31,575 --> 00:01:31,943
these things,

108
00:01:31,943 --> 00:01:32,359
notwithstanding my weakness.

109
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:32,248
12 And I pray

110
00:01:32,248 --> 00:01:32,137
the Father in

111
00:01:32,137 --> 00:01:32,026
the name of

112
00:01:32,026 --> 00:01:31,915
Christ that many

113
00:01:31,915 --> 00:01:31,804
of us, if not

114
00:01:31,804 --> 00:01:31,693
all, may be

115
00:01:31,693 --> 00:01:31,582
saved in his

116
00:01:31,582 --> 00:01:31,471
kingdom at that

117
00:01:31,471 --> 00:01:31,425
great and last day.

118
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:32,025
13 And now,

119
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:32,625
my beloved

120
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:33,225
brethren, all

121
00:01:33,225 --> 00:01:33,825
those who are

122
00:01:33,825 --> 00:01:34,425
of the house

123
00:01:34,425 --> 00:01:35,025
of Israel, and

124
00:01:35,025 --> 00:01:35,625
all ye ends

125
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:36,225
of the earth,

126
00:01:36,225 --> 00:01:36,825
I speak unto

127
00:01:36,825 --> 00:01:37,425
you as the

128
00:01:37,425 --> 00:01:38,025
voice of one

129
00:01:38,025 --> 00:01:38,625
crying from

130
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:39,225
the dust:

131
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:39,825
Farewell until

132
00:01:39,825 --> 00:01:40,4
that great day shall come.

133
00:01:40,4 --> 00:01:40,536
14 And you

134
00:01:40,536 --> 00:01:40,672
that will not

135
00:01:40,672 --> 00:01:40,808
partake of

136
00:01:40,808 --> 00:01:40,944
the goodness

137
00:01:40,944 --> 00:01:41,08
of God, and

138
00:01:41,08 --> 00:01:41,216
respect the

139
00:01:41,216 --> 00:01:41,352
words of

140
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:41,488
the Jews, and

141
00:01:41,488 --> 00:01:41,624
also my

142
00:01:41,624 --> 00:01:41,76
words, and the

143
00:01:41,76 --> 00:01:41,896
words which

144
00:01:41,896 --> 00:01:42,032
shall proceed

145
00:01:42,032 --> 00:01:42,168
forth out

146
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:42,304
of the mouth

147
00:01:42,304 --> 00:01:42,44
of the Lamb

148
00:01:42,44 --> 00:01:42,576
of God,

149
00:01:42,576 --> 00:01:42,712
behold, I bid

150
00:01:42,712 --> 00:01:42,848
you an

151
00:01:42,848 --> 00:01:42,984
everlasting

152
00:01:42,984 --> 00:01:43,12
farewell, for these

153
00:01:43,12 --> 00:01:43,256
words shall

154
00:01:43,256 --> 00:01:43,87
condemn you at the last day.

155
00:01:43,87 --> 00:01:43,787
15 For what

156
00:01:43,787 --> 00:01:43,704
I seal on

157
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:43,621
earth,

158
00:01:43,621 --> 00:01:43,538
shall be

159
00:01:43,538 --> 00:01:43,455
brought against

160
00:01:43,455 --> 00:01:43,372
you at the

161
00:01:43,372 --> 00:01:43,289
judgment

162
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:43,206
bar; for thus

163
00:01:43,206 --> 00:01:43,123
hath the

164
00:01:43,123 --> 00:01:43,04
Lord

165
00:01:43,04 --> 00:01:42,957
commanded me, and I

166
00:01:42,957 --> 00:01:42,936
must obey. Amen.
