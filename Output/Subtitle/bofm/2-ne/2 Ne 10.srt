1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:03,333
Chapter 10 Jacob explains that the Jews will

2
00:00:03,333 --> 00:00:06,666
crucify their God—They will be scattered

3
00:00:06,666 --> 00:00:09,999
until they begin to believe in Him—America

4
00:00:09,999 --> 00:00:13,332
will be a land of liberty where no king will

5
00:00:13,332 --> 00:00:16,665
rule—Reconcile yourselves to God and gain

6
00:00:16,665 --> 00:00:20,854
salvation through His grace. About 559–545 B.C. 

7
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:28,187
1 And now I, Jacob, speak unto you

8
00:00:28,187 --> 00:00:35,52
again, my beloved brethren, concerning this

9
00:00:35,52 --> 00:00:42,643
righteous branch of which I have spoken.

10
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:42,743
2 For behold, the promises which we

11
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:42,843
have obtained are promises unto us

12
00:00:42,843 --> 00:00:42,943
according to the flesh; wherefore, as it

13
00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:43,043
has been shown unto me that many of

14
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:43,143
our children shall perish in the

15
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:43,243
flesh because of unbelief, nevertheless,

16
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:43,343
God will be merciful unto many; and

17
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:43,443
our children shall be restored, that

18
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:43,543
they may come to that which will give

19
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:43,11
them the true knowledge of their Redeemer.

20
00:00:43,11 --> 00:00:43,81
3 Wherefore, as I said unto you, it

21
00:00:43,81 --> 00:00:44,51
must needs be expedient that

22
00:00:44,51 --> 00:00:45,21
Christ—for in the last night the angel

23
00:00:45,21 --> 00:00:45,91
spake unto me that this should be

24
00:00:45,91 --> 00:00:46,61
his name—should come among the Jews,

25
00:00:46,61 --> 00:00:47,31
among those who are the more wicked

26
00:00:47,31 --> 00:00:48,01
part of the world; and they shall

27
00:00:48,01 --> 00:00:48,71
crucify him—for thus it behooveth

28
00:00:48,71 --> 00:00:49,41
our God, and there is none other

29
00:00:49,41 --> 00:00:50,584
nation on earth that would crucify their God.

30
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:50,334
4 For should the mighty

31
00:00:50,334 --> 00:00:50,084
miracles be wrought among other

32
00:00:50,084 --> 00:00:49,834
nations they would repent,

33
00:00:49,834 --> 00:00:49,65
and know that he be their God.

34
00:00:49,65 --> 00:00:49,65
5 But because of

35
00:00:49,65 --> 00:00:49,65
priestcrafts and iniquities,

36
00:00:49,65 --> 00:00:49,65
they at Jerusalem will

37
00:00:49,65 --> 00:00:49,65
stiffen their necks against

38
00:00:49,65 --> 00:00:49,182
him, that he be crucified.

39
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:49,557
6 Wherefore, because of

40
00:00:49,557 --> 00:00:49,932
their iniquities,

41
00:00:49,932 --> 00:00:50,307
destructions, famines,

42
00:00:50,307 --> 00:00:50,682
pestilences, and bloodshed

43
00:00:50,682 --> 00:00:51,057
shall come upon them;

44
00:00:51,057 --> 00:00:51,432
and they who shall not

45
00:00:51,432 --> 00:00:51,807
be destroyed shall be

46
00:00:51,807 --> 00:00:52,653
scattered among all nations.

47
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:53,017
7 But behold, thus

48
00:00:53,017 --> 00:00:53,381
saith the Lord God: When

49
00:00:53,381 --> 00:00:53,745
the day cometh that

50
00:00:53,745 --> 00:00:54,109
they shall believe in

51
00:00:54,109 --> 00:00:54,473
me, that I am Christ,

52
00:00:54,473 --> 00:00:54,837
then have I covenanted

53
00:00:54,837 --> 00:00:55,201
with their fathers that

54
00:00:55,201 --> 00:00:55,565
they shall be

55
00:00:55,565 --> 00:00:55,929
restored in the flesh, upon

56
00:00:55,929 --> 00:00:56,293
the earth, unto the

57
00:00:56,293 --> 00:00:56,123
lands of their inheritance.

58
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:57,123
8 And it shall come to

59
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:58,123
pass that they shall

60
00:00:58,123 --> 00:00:59,123
be gathered in from

61
00:00:59,123 --> 00:01:00,123
their long dispersion,

62
00:01:00,123 --> 00:01:01,123
from the isles of the

63
00:01:01,123 --> 00:01:02,123
sea, and from the four

64
00:01:02,123 --> 00:01:03,123
parts of the earth;

65
00:01:03,123 --> 00:01:04,123
and the nations of the

66
00:01:04,123 --> 00:01:05,123
Gentiles shall be great

67
00:01:05,123 --> 00:01:06,123
in the eyes of me,

68
00:01:06,123 --> 00:01:07,123
saith God, in carrying

69
00:01:07,123 --> 00:01:08,123
them forth to the lands

70
00:01:08,123 --> 00:01:09,937
of their inheritance.

71
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:10,119
9 Yea, the kings of

72
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:10,301
the Gentiles shall

73
00:01:10,301 --> 00:01:10,483
be nursing fathers

74
00:01:10,483 --> 00:01:10,665
unto them, and their

75
00:01:10,665 --> 00:01:10,847
queens shall become

76
00:01:10,847 --> 00:01:11,029
nursing mothers;

77
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:11,211
wherefore, the promises

78
00:01:11,211 --> 00:01:11,393
of the Lord are

79
00:01:11,393 --> 00:01:11,575
great unto the Gentiles,

80
00:01:11,575 --> 00:01:11,757
for he hath spoken

81
00:01:11,757 --> 00:01:11,405
it, and who can dispute?

82
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,262
10 But behold,

83
00:01:13,262 --> 00:01:15,119
this land, said

84
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,976
God, shall be a land

85
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:18,833
of thine

86
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:20,69
inheritance, and the

87
00:01:20,69 --> 00:01:22,547
Gentiles shall be

88
00:01:22,547 --> 00:01:24,785
blessed upon the land.

89
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:27,118
11 And this

90
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:29,451
land shall be a

91
00:01:29,451 --> 00:01:31,784
land of liberty

92
00:01:31,784 --> 00:01:34,117
unto the

93
00:01:34,117 --> 00:01:36,45
Gentiles, and there

94
00:01:36,45 --> 00:01:38,783
shall be no kings

95
00:01:38,783 --> 00:01:41,116
upon the land,

96
00:01:41,116 --> 00:01:43,449
who shall

97
00:01:43,449 --> 00:01:45,138
raise up unto the Gentiles.

98
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:47,638
12 And I will

99
00:01:47,638 --> 00:01:50,138
fortify this

100
00:01:50,138 --> 00:01:52,638
land against

101
00:01:52,638 --> 00:01:55,048
all other nations.

102
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:54,848
13 And he

103
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:54,648
that fighteth

104
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:54,448
against Zion

105
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:54,248
shall

106
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:54,581
perish, saith God.

107
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:54,848
14 For he

108
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:55,115
that raiseth

109
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:55,382
up a king

110
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:55,649
against me

111
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:55,916
shall

112
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:56,183
perish, for I,

113
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:56,45
the Lord,

114
00:01:56,45 --> 00:01:56,717
the king of

115
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:56,984
heaven, will

116
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:57,251
be their

117
00:01:57,251 --> 00:01:57,518
king, and I

118
00:01:57,518 --> 00:01:57,785
will be a

119
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:58,052
light unto

120
00:01:58,052 --> 00:01:58,319
them

121
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:58,051
forever, that hear my words.

122
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:58,703
15

123
00:01:58,703 --> 00:01:59,355
Wherefore, for

124
00:01:59,355 --> 00:02:00,007
this cause,

125
00:02:00,007 --> 00:02:00,659
that my

126
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:01,311
covenants

127
00:02:01,311 --> 00:02:01,963
may be

128
00:02:01,963 --> 00:02:02,615
fulfilled which

129
00:02:02,615 --> 00:02:03,267
I have

130
00:02:03,267 --> 00:02:03,919
made unto

131
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:04,571
the children

132
00:02:04,571 --> 00:02:05,223
of men,

133
00:02:05,223 --> 00:02:05,875
that I will

134
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:06,527
do unto

135
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:07,179
them while

136
00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:07,831
they are

137
00:02:07,831 --> 00:02:08,483
in the

138
00:02:08,483 --> 00:02:09,135
flesh, I must

139
00:02:09,135 --> 00:02:09,787
needs

140
00:02:09,787 --> 00:02:10,439
destroy the

141
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:11,091
secret works

142
00:02:11,091 --> 00:02:11,743
of

143
00:02:11,743 --> 00:02:12,395
darkness, and of

144
00:02:12,395 --> 00:02:13,967
murders, and of abominations.

145
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
16

146
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
Wherefore, he

147
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
that

148
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
fighteth

149
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
against Zion,

150
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
both Jew

151
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
and

152
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
Gentile, both

153
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
bond and

154
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
free,

155
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
both male

156
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
and female,

157
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
shall

158
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
perish; for

159
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
they are

160
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
they who

161
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
are the

162
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
whore of

163
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
all the

164
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
earth; for

165
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
they who

166
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
are not

167
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
for me

168
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
are against me, saith our God.

169
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
17 For I

170
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
will

171
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
fulfil my

172
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
promises

173
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
which I

174
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
have

175
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
made unto

176
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
the

177
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
children of

178
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
men,

179
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
that I will

180
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
do unto

181
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
them

182
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
while they

183
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
are in the flesh—

184
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
18

185
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
Wherefore,

186
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
my

187
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
beloved

188
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
brethren,

189
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
thus

190
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
saith our

191
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
God: I

192
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
will

193
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
afflict

194
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
thy

195
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
seed by

196
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
the hand

197
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
of the

198
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967


199
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
Gentiles;

200
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967


201
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
nevertheless, I

202
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:13,967
