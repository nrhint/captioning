00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 10 Jacob explains that the Jews will

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
crucify their God—They will be scattered

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
until they begin to believe in Him—America

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
will be a land of liberty where no king will

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
rule—Reconcile yourselves to God and gain

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:03:31,
salvation through His grace. About 559–545 B.C. 

7
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
1 And now I, Jacob, speak unto you

8
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
again, my beloved brethren, concerning this

9
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:03,
righteous branch of which I have spoken.

10
00:03:03,0 --> 00:03:03,0
2 For behold, the promises which we

11
00:03:03,0 --> 00:03:03,0
have obtained are promises unto us

12
00:03:03,0 --> 00:03:03,0
according to the flesh; wherefore, as it

13
00:03:03,0 --> 00:03:03,0
has been shown unto me that many of

14
00:03:03,0 --> 00:03:03,0
our children shall perish in the

15
00:03:03,0 --> 00:03:03,0
flesh because of unbelief, nevertheless,

16
00:03:03,0 --> 00:03:03,0
God will be merciful unto many; and

17
00:03:03,0 --> 00:03:03,0
our children shall be restored, that

18
00:03:03,0 --> 00:03:03,0
they may come to that which will give

19
00:03:03,0 --> 00:09:13,
them the true knowledge of their Redeemer.

20
00:09:13,0 --> 00:09:13,0
3 Wherefore, as I said unto you, it

21
00:09:13,0 --> 00:09:13,0
must needs be expedient that

22
00:09:13,0 --> 00:09:13,0
Christ—for in the last night the angel

23
00:09:13,0 --> 00:09:13,0
spake unto me that this should be

24
00:09:13,0 --> 00:09:13,0
his name—should come among the Jews,

25
00:09:13,0 --> 00:09:13,0
among those who are the more wicked

26
00:09:13,0 --> 00:09:13,0
part of the world; and they shall

27
00:09:13,0 --> 00:09:13,0
crucify him—for thus it behooveth

28
00:09:13,0 --> 00:09:13,0
our God, and there is none other

29
00:09:13,0 --> 00:17:24,
nation on earth that would crucify their God.

30
00:17:24,0 --> 00:17:24,0
4 For should the mighty

31
00:17:24,0 --> 00:17:24,0
miracles be wrought among other

32
00:17:24,0 --> 00:17:24,0
nations they would repent,

33
00:17:24,0 --> 00:19:08,
and know that he be their God.

34
00:19:08,0 --> 00:19:08,0
5 But because of

35
00:19:08,0 --> 00:19:08,0
priestcrafts and iniquities,

36
00:19:08,0 --> 00:19:08,0
they at Jerusalem will

37
00:19:08,0 --> 00:19:08,0
stiffen their necks against

38
00:19:08,0 --> 00:26:03,
him, that he be crucified.

39
00:26:03,0 --> 00:26:03,0
6 Wherefore, because of

40
00:26:03,0 --> 00:26:03,0
their iniquities,

41
00:26:03,0 --> 00:26:03,0
destructions, famines,

42
00:26:03,0 --> 00:26:03,0
pestilences, and bloodshed

43
00:26:03,0 --> 00:26:03,0
shall come upon them;

44
00:26:03,0 --> 00:26:03,0
and they who shall not

45
00:26:03,0 --> 00:26:03,0
be destroyed shall be

46
00:26:03,0 --> 00:25:35,
scattered among all nations.

47
00:25:35,0 --> 00:25:35,0
7 But behold, thus

48
00:25:35,0 --> 00:25:35,0
saith the Lord God: When

49
00:25:35,0 --> 00:25:35,0
the day cometh that

50
00:25:35,0 --> 00:25:35,0
they shall believe in

51
00:25:35,0 --> 00:25:35,0
me, that I am Christ,

52
00:25:35,0 --> 00:25:35,0
then have I covenanted

53
00:25:35,0 --> 00:25:35,0
with their fathers that

54
00:25:35,0 --> 00:25:35,0
they shall be

55
00:25:35,0 --> 00:25:35,0
restored in the flesh, upon

56
00:25:35,0 --> 00:25:35,0
the earth, unto the

57
00:25:35,0 --> 00:25:07,
lands of their inheritance.

58
00:25:07,0 --> 00:25:07,0
8 And it shall come to

59
00:25:07,0 --> 00:25:07,0
pass that they shall

60
00:25:07,0 --> 00:25:07,0
be gathered in from

61
00:25:07,0 --> 00:25:07,0
their long dispersion,

62
00:25:07,0 --> 00:25:07,0
from the isles of the

63
00:25:07,0 --> 00:25:07,0
sea, and from the four

64
00:25:07,0 --> 00:25:07,0
parts of the earth;

65
00:25:07,0 --> 00:25:07,0
and the nations of the

66
00:25:07,0 --> 00:25:07,0
Gentiles shall be great

67
00:25:07,0 --> 00:25:07,0
in the eyes of me,

68
00:25:07,0 --> 00:25:07,0
saith God, in carrying

69
00:25:07,0 --> 00:25:07,0
them forth to the lands

70
00:25:07,0 --> 00:24:39,
of their inheritance.

71
00:24:39,0 --> 00:24:39,0
9 Yea, the kings of

72
00:24:39,0 --> 00:24:39,0
the Gentiles shall

73
00:24:39,0 --> 00:24:39,0
be nursing fathers

74
00:24:39,0 --> 00:24:39,0
unto them, and their

75
00:24:39,0 --> 00:24:39,0
queens shall become

76
00:24:39,0 --> 00:24:39,0
nursing mothers;

77
00:24:39,0 --> 00:24:39,0
wherefore, the promises

78
00:24:39,0 --> 00:24:39,0
of the Lord are

79
00:24:39,0 --> 00:24:39,0
great unto the Gentiles,

80
00:24:39,0 --> 00:24:39,0
for he hath spoken

81
00:24:39,0 --> 00:24:25,
it, and who can dispute?

82
00:24:25,0 --> 00:24:25,0
10 But behold,

83
00:24:25,0 --> 00:24:25,0
this land, said

84
00:24:25,0 --> 00:24:25,0
God, shall be a land

85
00:24:25,0 --> 00:24:25,0
of thine

86
00:24:25,0 --> 00:24:25,0
inheritance, and the

87
00:24:25,0 --> 00:24:25,0
Gentiles shall be

88
00:24:25,0 --> 00:25:37,
blessed upon the land.

89
00:25:37,0 --> 00:25:37,0
11 And this

90
00:25:37,0 --> 00:25:37,0
land shall be a

91
00:25:37,0 --> 00:25:37,0
land of liberty

92
00:25:37,0 --> 00:25:37,0
unto the

93
00:25:37,0 --> 00:25:37,0
Gentiles, and there

94
00:25:37,0 --> 00:25:37,0
shall be no kings

95
00:25:37,0 --> 00:25:37,0
upon the land,

96
00:25:37,0 --> 00:25:37,0
who shall

97
00:25:37,0 --> 00:25:09,
raise up unto the Gentiles.

98
00:25:09,0 --> 00:25:09,0
12 And I will

99
00:25:09,0 --> 00:25:09,0
fortify this

100
00:25:09,0 --> 00:25:09,0
land against

101
00:25:09,0 --> 00:25:53,
all other nations.

102
00:25:53,0 --> 00:25:53,0
13 And he

103
00:25:53,0 --> 00:25:53,0
that fighteth

104
00:25:53,0 --> 00:25:53,0
against Zion

105
00:25:53,0 --> 00:25:53,0
shall

106
00:25:53,0 --> 00:25:25,
perish, saith God.

107
00:25:25,0 --> 00:25:25,0
14 For he

108
00:25:25,0 --> 00:25:25,0
that raiseth

109
00:25:25,0 --> 00:25:25,0
up a king

110
00:25:25,0 --> 00:25:25,0
against me

111
00:25:25,0 --> 00:25:25,0
shall

112
00:25:25,0 --> 00:25:25,0
perish, for I,

113
00:25:25,0 --> 00:25:25,0
the Lord,

114
00:25:25,0 --> 00:25:25,0
the king of

115
00:25:25,0 --> 00:25:25,0
heaven, will

116
00:25:25,0 --> 00:25:25,0
be their

117
00:25:25,0 --> 00:25:25,0
king, and I

118
00:25:25,0 --> 00:25:25,0
will be a

119
00:25:25,0 --> 00:25:25,0
light unto

120
00:25:25,0 --> 00:25:25,0
them

121
00:25:25,0 --> 00:27:37,
forever, that hear my words.

122
00:27:37,0 --> 00:27:37,0
15

123
00:27:37,0 --> 00:27:37,0
Wherefore, for

124
00:27:37,0 --> 00:27:37,0
this cause,

125
00:27:37,0 --> 00:27:37,0
that my

126
00:27:37,0 --> 00:27:37,0
covenants

127
00:27:37,0 --> 00:27:37,0
may be

128
00:27:37,0 --> 00:27:37,0
fulfilled which

129
00:27:37,0 --> 00:27:37,0
I have

130
00:27:37,0 --> 00:27:37,0
made unto

131
00:27:37,0 --> 00:27:37,0
the children

132
00:27:37,0 --> 00:27:37,0
of men,

133
00:27:37,0 --> 00:27:37,0
that I will

134
00:27:37,0 --> 00:27:37,0
do unto

135
00:27:37,0 --> 00:27:37,0
them while

136
00:27:37,0 --> 00:27:37,0
they are

137
00:27:37,0 --> 00:27:37,0
in the

138
00:27:37,0 --> 00:27:37,0
flesh, I must

139
00:27:37,0 --> 00:27:37,0
needs

140
00:27:37,0 --> 00:27:37,0
destroy the

141
00:27:37,0 --> 00:27:37,0
secret works

142
00:27:37,0 --> 00:27:37,0
of

143
00:27:37,0 --> 00:27:37,0
darkness, and of

144
00:27:37,0 --> 00:35:35,
murders, and of abominations.

145
00:35:35,0 --> 00:35:35,0
16

146
00:35:35,0 --> 00:35:35,0
Wherefore, he

147
00:35:35,0 --> 00:35:35,0
that

148
00:35:35,0 --> 00:35:35,0
fighteth

149
00:35:35,0 --> 00:35:35,0
against Zion,

150
00:35:35,0 --> 00:35:35,0
both Jew

151
00:35:35,0 --> 00:35:35,0
and

152
00:35:35,0 --> 00:35:35,0
Gentile, both

153
00:35:35,0 --> 00:35:35,0
bond and

154
00:35:35,0 --> 00:35:35,0
free,

155
00:35:35,0 --> 00:35:35,0
both male

156
00:35:35,0 --> 00:35:35,0
and female,

157
00:35:35,0 --> 00:35:35,0
shall

158
00:35:35,0 --> 00:35:35,0
perish; for

159
00:35:35,0 --> 00:35:35,0
they are

160
00:35:35,0 --> 00:35:35,0
they who

161
00:35:35,0 --> 00:35:35,0
are the

162
00:35:35,0 --> 00:35:35,0
whore of

163
00:35:35,0 --> 00:35:35,0
all the

164
00:35:35,0 --> 00:35:35,0
earth; for

165
00:35:35,0 --> 00:35:35,0
they who

166
00:35:35,0 --> 00:35:35,0
are not

167
00:35:35,0 --> 00:35:35,0
for me

168
00:35:35,0 --> 00:58:12,
are against me, saith our God.

169
00:58:12,0 --> 00:58:12,0
17 For I

170
00:58:12,0 --> 00:58:12,0
will

171
00:58:12,0 --> 00:58:12,0
fulfil my

172
00:58:12,0 --> 00:58:12,0
promises

173
00:58:12,0 --> 00:58:12,0
which I

174
00:58:12,0 --> 00:58:12,0
have

175
00:58:12,0 --> 00:58:12,0
made unto

176
00:58:12,0 --> 00:58:12,0
the

177
00:58:12,0 --> 00:58:12,0
children of

178
00:58:12,0 --> 00:58:12,0
men,

179
00:58:12,0 --> 00:58:12,0
that I will

180
00:58:12,0 --> 00:58:12,0
do unto

181
00:58:12,0 --> 00:58:12,0
them

182
00:58:12,0 --> 00:58:12,0
while they

183
00:58:12,0 --> 00:58:56,
are in the flesh—

184
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
18

185
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
Wherefore,

186
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
my

187
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
beloved

188
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
brethren,

189
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
thus

190
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
saith our

191
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
God: I

192
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
will

193
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
afflict

194
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
thy

195
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
seed by

196
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
the hand

197
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
of the

198
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0


199
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
Gentiles;

200
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0


201
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
nevertheless, I

202
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
will

203
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
soften the

204
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
hearts

205
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
of the

206
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0


207
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
Gentiles, that

208
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
they

209
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
shall be

210
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
like

211
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
unto a

212
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
father

213
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
to them;

214
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0


215
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
wherefore,

216
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
the

217
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
Gentiles

218
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
shall be

219
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
blessed

220
00:58:56,0 --> 01:02:27,
and numbered among the house of Israel.

221
01:02:27,0 --> 01:02:27,0
19

222
01:02:27,0 --> 01:02:27,0


223
01:02:27,0 --> 01:02:27,0
Wherefore, I

224
01:02:27,0 --> 01:02:27,0
will

225
