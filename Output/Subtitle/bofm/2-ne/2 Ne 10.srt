00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,167
Chapter 10 Jacob explains that the Jews will

2
00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:02,334
 crucify their God—They will be scattered until they

3
00:00:02,334 --> 00:00:03,501
 begin to believe in Him—America will be a land of

4
00:00:03,501 --> 00:00:04,668
 liberty where no king will rule—Reconcile yourselves

5
00:00:04,668 --> 00:00:05,835
 to God and gain salvation through His grace. About

6
00:00:05,835 --> 00:00:07,002
 559–545 B.C.

7
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:10,642
1 And now I, Jacob, speak unto you again, my

8
00:00:10,642 --> 00:00:13,309
 beloved brethren, concerning this righteous branch of

9
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:15,976
 which I have spoken

10
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:16,949
2 For behold, the promises which we have obtained

11
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:17,949
 are promises unto us according to the flesh;

12
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:18,949
 wherefore, as it has been shown unto me that many of

13
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:19,949
 our children shall perish in the flesh because of

14
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:20,949
 unbelief, nevertheless, God will be merciful unto

15
00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:21,949
 many; and our children shall be restored, that they

16
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:22,949
 may come to that which will give them the true

17
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:23,949
 knowledge of their Redeemer

18
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:24,924
3 Wherefore, as I said unto you, it must needs be

19
00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:25,924
 expedient that Christ—for in the last night the

20
00:00:25,924 --> 00:00:26,924
 angel spake unto me that this should be his

21
00:00:26,924 --> 00:00:27,924
 name—should come among the Jews, among those who are the

22
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:28,924
 more wicked part of the world; and they shall

23
00:00:28,924 --> 00:00:29,924
 crucify him—for thus it behooveth our God, and there is

24
00:00:29,924 --> 00:00:30,924
 none other nation on earth that would crucify

25
00:00:30,924 --> 00:00:31,924
 their God

26
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:34,566
4 For should the mighty miracles be wrought among

27
00:00:34,566 --> 00:00:37,233
 other nations they would repent, and know that he

28
00:00:37,233 --> 00:00:39,9
 be their God

29
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,54
5 But because of priestcrafts and iniquities, they

30
00:00:42,54 --> 00:00:45,207
 at Jerusalem will stiffen their necks against

31
00:00:45,207 --> 00:00:47,874
 him, that he be crucified

32
00:00:47,848 --> 00:01:01,848
6 Wherefore, because of their iniquities,

33
00:01:01,848 --> 00:01:15,848
 destructions, famines, pestilences, and bloodshed shall

34
00:01:15,848 --> 00:01:29,848
 come upon them; and they who shall not be destroyed

35
00:01:29,848 --> 00:01:43,848
 shall be scattered among all nations

36
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:45,27
7 But behold, thus saith the Lord God: When the

37
00:01:45,27 --> 00:01:46,87
 day cometh that they shall believe in me, that I am

38
00:01:46,87 --> 00:01:48,47
 Christ, then have I covenanted with their fathers

39
00:01:48,47 --> 00:01:50,07
 that they shall be restored in the flesh, upon the

40
00:01:50,07 --> 00:01:51,67
 earth, unto the lands of their inheritance

41
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:58,312
8 And it shall come to pass that they shall be

42
00:01:58,312 --> 00:02:04,979
 gathered in from their long dispersion, from the

43
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:11,646
 isles of the sea, and from the four parts of the

44
00:02:11,646 --> 00:02:18,313
 earth; and the nations of the Gentiles shall be great

45
00:02:18,313 --> 00:02:24,98
 in the eyes of me, saith God, in carrying them

46
00:02:24,98 --> 00:02:31,647
 forth to the lands of their inheritance

47
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,118
9 Yea, the kings of the Gentiles shall be nursing

48
00:02:33,118 --> 00:02:34,718
 fathers unto them, and their queens shall become

49
00:02:34,718 --> 00:02:36,318
 nursing mothers; wherefore, the promises of the

50
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:37,918
 Lord are great unto the Gentiles, for he hath spoken

51
00:02:37,918 --> 00:02:39,518
 it, and who can dispute

52
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:44,826
10 But behold, this land, said God, shall be a

53
00:02:44,826 --> 00:02:50,159
 land of thine inheritance, and the Gentiles shall be

54
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:55,492
 blessed upon the land

55
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:58,109
11 And this land shall be a land of liberty unto

56
00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:00,776
 the Gentiles, and there shall be no kings upon the

57
00:03:00,776 --> 00:03:03,443
 land, who shall raise up unto the Gentiles

58
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:11,417
12 And I will fortify this land against all other

59
00:03:11,417 --> 00:03:19,417
 nations

60
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:27,366
13 And he that fighteth against Zion shall perish,

61
00:03:27,366 --> 00:03:35,366
 saith God

62
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:39,315
14 For he that raiseth up a king against me shall

63
00:03:39,315 --> 00:03:43,315
 perish, for I, the Lord, the king of heaven, will

64
00:03:43,315 --> 00:03:47,315
 be their king, and I will be a light unto them

65
00:03:47,315 --> 00:03:51,315
 forever, that hear my words

66
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:55,264
15 Wherefore, for this cause, that my covenants

67
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:59,264
 may be fulfilled which I have made unto the children

68
00:03:59,264 --> 00:04:03,264
 of men, that I will do unto them while they are

69
00:04:03,264 --> 00:04:07,264
 in the flesh, I must needs destroy the secret works

70
00:04:07,264 --> 00:04:11,264
 of darkness, and of murders, and of abominations

71
00:04:11,264 --> 00:04:15,264


72
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:18,388
16 Wherefore, he that fighteth against Zion, both

73
00:04:18,388 --> 00:04:21,588
 Jew and Gentile, both bond and free, both male and

74
00:04:21,588 --> 00:04:24,788
 female, shall perish; for they are they who are

75
00:04:24,788 --> 00:04:27,988
 the whore of all the earth; for they who are not

76
00:04:27,988 --> 00:04:31,188
 for me are against me, saith our God

77
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:33,805
17 For I will fulfil my promises which I have made

78
00:04:33,805 --> 00:04:36,472
 unto the children of men, that I will do unto

79
00:04:36,472 --> 00:04:39,139
 them while they are in the flesh

80
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,445
18 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, thus saith our

81
00:04:40,445 --> 00:04:41,778
 God: I will afflict thy seed by the hand of the

82
00:04:41,778 --> 00:04:43,111
 Gentiles; nevertheless, I will soften the hearts of

83
00:04:43,111 --> 00:04:44,444
 the Gentiles, that they shall be like unto a

84
00:04:44,444 --> 00:04:45,777
 father to them; wherefore, the Gentiles shall be

85
00:04:45,777 --> 00:04:47,11
 blessed and numbered among the house of Israel

86
00:04:47,087 --> 00:05:04,087
19 Wherefore, I will consecrate this land unto thy

87
00:05:04,087 --> 00:05:21,087
 seed, and them who shall be numbered among thy

88
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:38,087
 seed, forever, for the land of their inheritance;

89
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:55,087
 for it is a choice land, saith God unto me, above

90
00:05:55,087 --> 00:06:12,087
 all other lands, wherefore I will have all men that

91
00:06:12,087 --> 00:06:29,087
 dwell thereon that they shall worship me, saith

92
00:06:29,087 --> 00:06:46,087
 God

93
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:56,484
20 And now, my beloved brethren, seeing that our

94
00:06:56,484 --> 00:07:06,262
 merciful God has given us so great knowledge

95
00:07:06,262 --> 00:07:16,04
 concerning these things, let us remember him, and lay

96
00:07:16,04 --> 00:07:25,818
 aside our sins, and not hang down our heads, for we

97
00:07:25,818 --> 00:07:35,596
 are not cast off; nevertheless, we have been

98
00:07:35,596 --> 00:07:45,374
 driven out of the land of our inheritance; but we have

99
00:07:45,374 --> 00:07:55,152
 been led to a better land, for the Lord has made

100
00:07:55,152 --> 00:08:04,93
 the sea our path, and we are upon an isle of the

101
00:08:04,93 --> 00:08:14,708
 sea

102
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:18,427
21 But great are the promises of the Lord unto

103
00:08:18,427 --> 00:08:22,427
 them who are upon the isles of the sea; wherefore as

104
00:08:22,427 --> 00:08:26,427
 it says isles, there must needs be more than this,

105
00:08:26,427 --> 00:08:30,427
 and they are inhabited also by our brethren

106
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:39,977
22 For behold, the Lord God has led away from time

107
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:49,577
 to time from the house of Israel, according to

108
00:08:49,577 --> 00:08:59,177
 his will and pleasure. And now behold, the Lord

109
00:08:59,177 --> 00:09:08,777
 remembereth all them who have been broken off,

110
00:09:08,777 --> 00:09:18,377
 wherefore he remembereth us also

111
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:26,224
23 Therefore, cheer up your hearts, and remember

112
00:09:26,224 --> 00:09:34,224
 that ye are free to act for yourselves—to choose

113
00:09:34,224 --> 00:09:42,224
 the way of everlasting death or the way of eternal

114
00:09:42,224 --> 00:09:50,224
 life

115
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:53,323
24 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, reconcile

116
00:09:53,323 --> 00:09:56,523
 yourselves to the will of God, and not to the will of

117
00:09:56,523 --> 00:09:59,723
 the devil and the flesh; and remember, after ye are

118
00:09:59,723 --> 00:10:02,923
 reconciled unto God, that it is only in and

119
00:10:02,923 --> 00:10:06,123
 through the grace of God that ye are saved

120
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:06,072
25 Wherefore, may God raise you from death by the

121
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:06,072
 power of the resurrection, and also from

122
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:06,072
 everlasting death by the power of the atonement, that ye

123
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:06,072
 may be received into the eternal kingdom of God,

124
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:06,072
 that ye may praise him through grace divine. Amen.
