00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 13 Judah and Jerusalem will be

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
punished for their disobedience—The Lord pleads

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
for and judges His people—The daughters of

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Zion are cursed and tormented for their

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:11:42,
worldliness—Compare 
Isaiah 3. About 559–545 B.C. 

6
00:11:42,0 --> 00:11:42,0
1 For behold, the Lord, the Lord of Hosts,

7
00:11:42,0 --> 00:11:42,0
doth take away from Jerusalem, and from

8
00:11:42,0 --> 00:11:42,0
Judah, the stay and the staff, the whole

9
00:11:42,0 --> 00:18:08,
staff of bread, and the whole stay of water—

10
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
2 The mighty man, and the man of

11
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
war, the judge, and the prophet,

12
00:18:08,0 --> 00:23:51,
and the prudent, and the ancient;

13
00:23:51,0 --> 00:23:51,0
3 The captain of fifty, and

14
00:23:51,0 --> 00:23:51,0
the honorable man, and the

15
00:23:51,0 --> 00:23:51,0
counselor, and the cunning

16
00:23:51,0 --> 00:26:47,
artificer, and the eloquent orator.

17
00:26:47,0 --> 00:26:47,0
4 And I will give

18
00:26:47,0 --> 00:26:47,0
children unto them to be

19
00:26:47,0 --> 00:26:47,0
their princes, and

20
00:26:47,0 --> 00:26:19,
babes shall rule over them.

21
00:26:19,0 --> 00:26:19,0
5 And the people

22
00:26:19,0 --> 00:26:19,0
shall be oppressed,

23
00:26:19,0 --> 00:26:19,0
every one by another,

24
00:26:19,0 --> 00:26:19,0
and every one by his

25
00:26:19,0 --> 00:26:19,0
neighbor; the child

26
00:26:19,0 --> 00:26:19,0
shall behave himself

27
00:26:19,0 --> 00:26:19,0
proudly against the

28
00:26:19,0 --> 00:26:19,0
ancient, and the

29
00:26:19,0 --> 00:25:51,
base against the honorable.

30
00:25:51,0 --> 00:25:51,0
6 When a man shall

31
00:25:51,0 --> 00:25:51,0
take hold of his

32
00:25:51,0 --> 00:25:51,0
brother of the

33
00:25:51,0 --> 00:25:51,0
house of his father,

34
00:25:51,0 --> 00:25:51,0
and shall say:

35
00:25:51,0 --> 00:25:51,0
Thou hast clothing,

36
00:25:51,0 --> 00:25:51,0
be thou our ruler,

37
00:25:51,0 --> 00:25:51,0
and let not this

38
00:25:51,0 --> 00:25:23,
ruin come under thy hand—

39
00:25:23,0 --> 00:25:23,0
7 In that day

40
00:25:23,0 --> 00:25:23,0
shall he swear,

41
00:25:23,0 --> 00:25:23,0
saying: I will not

42
00:25:23,0 --> 00:25:23,0
be a healer;

43
00:25:23,0 --> 00:25:23,0
for in my house

44
00:25:23,0 --> 00:25:23,0
there is neither

45
00:25:23,0 --> 00:25:23,0
bread nor

46
00:25:23,0 --> 00:25:23,0
clothing; make me not a

47
00:25:23,0 --> 00:26:07,
ruler of the people.

48
00:26:07,0 --> 00:26:07,0
8 For

49
00:26:07,0 --> 00:26:07,0
Jerusalem is ruined,

50
00:26:07,0 --> 00:26:07,0
and Judah is

51
00:26:07,0 --> 00:26:07,0
fallen, because

52
00:26:07,0 --> 00:26:07,0
their tongues

53
00:26:07,0 --> 00:26:07,0
and their

54
00:26:07,0 --> 00:26:07,0
doings have been

55
00:26:07,0 --> 00:26:07,0
against the

56
00:26:07,0 --> 00:26:07,0
Lord, to provoke

57
00:26:07,0 --> 00:28:19,
the eyes of his glory.

58
00:28:19,0 --> 00:28:19,0
9 The show of

59
00:28:19,0 --> 00:28:19,0
their

60
00:28:19,0 --> 00:28:19,0
countenance doth

61
00:28:19,0 --> 00:28:19,0
witness against

62
00:28:19,0 --> 00:28:19,0
them, and

63
00:28:19,0 --> 00:28:19,0
doth declare

64
00:28:19,0 --> 00:28:19,0
their sin to be

65
00:28:19,0 --> 00:28:19,0
even as

66
00:28:19,0 --> 00:28:19,0
Sodom, and they

67
00:28:19,0 --> 00:28:19,0
cannot hide

68
00:28:19,0 --> 00:28:19,0
it. Wo unto

69
00:28:19,0 --> 00:28:19,0
their souls, for

70
00:28:19,0 --> 00:28:19,0
they have

71
00:28:19,0 --> 00:28:19,0
rewarded evil

72
00:28:19,0 --> 00:33:15,
unto themselves!

73
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
10 Say unto

74
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
the

75
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
righteous that it is

76
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
well with

77
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
them; for

78
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
they shall eat

79
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
the fruit of

80
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,
their doings.

81
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
11 Wo unto

82
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
the wicked,

83
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
for they

84
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
shall

85
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
perish; for the

86
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
reward of

87
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
their hands

88
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,
shall be upon them!

89
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
12 And my

90
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
people,

91
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
children are

92
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
their

93
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
oppressors,

94
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
and women

95
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
rule over

96
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
them. O my

97
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
people,

98
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
they who

99
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
lead thee

100
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
cause thee to

101
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
err and

102
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
destroy the

103
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,
way of thy paths.

104
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
13 The

105
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
Lord

106
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
standeth up to

107
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
plead,

108
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
and

109
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
standeth to

110
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,
judge the people.

111
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
14 The

112
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
Lord will

113
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
enter

114
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
into

115
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
judgment

116
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
with the

117
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
ancients

118
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
of his

119
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
people and

120
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
the

121
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
princes

122
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
thereof;

123
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
for ye

124
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
have eaten

125
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
up the

126
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
vineyard

127
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
and the

128
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
spoil of

129
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,
the poor in your houses.

130
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
15 What

131
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
mean

132
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
ye? Ye

133
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
beat my

134
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
people

135
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
to

136
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
pieces, and

137
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
grind

138
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
the

139
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
faces of

140
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
the

141
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
poor, saith

142
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
the

143
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,
Lord God of Hosts.

144
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
16

145
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
Moreover,

146
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
the

147
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
Lord

148
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
saith:

149
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
Because

150
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
the

151
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0


152
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
daughters of

153
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
Zion

154
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
are

155
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
haughty,

156
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
and

157
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
walk

158
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
with

159
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0


160
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
stretched-forth

161
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
necks

162
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
and

163
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
wanton

164
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
eyes,

165
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
walking

166
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
and

167
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
mincing

168
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
as

169
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
they go,

170
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
and

171
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,
making a tinkling with their feet—

172
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
17

173
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0


174
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
Therefore

175
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
the

176
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
Lord

177
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
will

178
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
smite

179
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
with a

180
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0

181
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0

182
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
crown

183
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0

184
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
the

00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
head of

186
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0

188
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0

189
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0

00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
Zion,

191
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
and the

192
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
Lord

193
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
will

194
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0


195
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,
discover their secret parts.

196
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
18

197
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
In

198
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
that

199
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
day

200
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
the

201
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
Lord

202
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
will

203
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0


204
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
take

205
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0

206
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
the

208
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
bravery

209
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
of

210
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,0
their

220
00:33:15,0 --> 00:33:15,
round tires like the moon;
