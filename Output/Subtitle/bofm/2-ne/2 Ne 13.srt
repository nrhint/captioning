00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:03,0
Chapter 13 Judah and Jerusalem will be

2
00:00:03,0 --> 00:00:06,0
punished for their disobedience—The Lord pleads

3
00:00:06,0 --> 00:00:09,0
for and judges His people—The daughters of

4
00:00:09,0 --> 00:00:12,0
Zion are cursed and tormented for their

5
00:00:12,0 --> 00:00:15,449
worldliness—Compare 
Isaiah 3. About 559–545 B.C. 

6
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:15,949
1 For behold, the Lord, the Lord of Hosts,

7
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:16,449
doth take away from Jerusalem, and from

8
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:16,949
Judah, the stay and the staff, the whole

9
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:17,851
staff of bread, and the whole stay of water—

10
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:29,518
2 The mighty man, and the man of

11
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:41,185
war, the judge, and the prophet,

12
00:00:41,185 --> 00:00:52,152
and the prudent, and the ancient;

13
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:51,902
3 The captain of fifty, and

14
00:00:51,902 --> 00:00:51,652
the honorable man, and the

15
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:51,402
counselor, and the cunning

16
00:00:51,402 --> 00:00:51,218
artificer, and the eloquent orator.

17
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:50,968
4 And I will give

18
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:50,718
children unto them to be

19
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:50,468
their princes, and

20
00:00:50,468 --> 00:00:50,751
babes shall rule over them.

21
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:51,084
5 And the people

22
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:51,417
shall be oppressed,

23
00:00:51,417 --> 00:00:51,75
every one by another,

24
00:00:51,75 --> 00:00:52,083
and every one by his

25
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:52,416
neighbor; the child

26
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:52,749
shall behave himself

27
00:00:52,749 --> 00:00:53,082
proudly against the

28
00:00:53,082 --> 00:00:53,415
ancient, and the

29
00:00:53,415 --> 00:00:53,754
base against the honorable.

30
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:53,643
6 When a man shall

31
00:00:53,643 --> 00:00:53,532
take hold of his

32
00:00:53,532 --> 00:00:53,421
brother of the

33
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:53,31
house of his father,

34
00:00:53,31 --> 00:00:53,199
and shall say:

35
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:53,088
Thou hast clothing,

36
00:00:53,088 --> 00:00:52,977
be thou our ruler,

37
00:00:52,977 --> 00:00:52,866
and let not this

38
00:00:52,866 --> 00:00:52,819
ruin come under thy hand—

39
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:52,708
7 In that day

40
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:52,597
shall he swear,

41
00:00:52,597 --> 00:00:52,486
saying: I will not

42
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:52,375
be a healer;

43
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:52,264
for in my house

44
00:00:52,264 --> 00:00:52,153
there is neither

45
00:00:52,153 --> 00:00:52,042
bread nor

46
00:00:52,042 --> 00:00:51,931
clothing; make me not a

47
00:00:51,931 --> 00:00:51,885
ruler of the people.

48
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:51,785
8 For

49
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:51,685
Jerusalem is ruined,

50
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:51,585
and Judah is

51
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:51,485
fallen, because

52
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:51,385
their tongues

53
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:51,285
and their

54
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:51,185
doings have been

55
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:51,085
against the

56
00:00:51,085 --> 00:00:50,985
Lord, to provoke

57
00:00:50,985 --> 00:00:50,951
the eyes of his glory.

58
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:50,951
9 The show of

59
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:50,951
their

60
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:50,951
countenance doth

61
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:50,951
witness against

62
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:50,951
them, and

63
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:50,951
doth declare

64
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:50,951
their sin to be

65
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:50,951
even as

66
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:50,951
Sodom, and they

67
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:50,951
cannot hide

68
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:50,951
it. Wo unto

69
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:50,951
their souls, for

70
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:50,951
they have

71
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:50,951
rewarded evil

72
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:50,484
unto themselves!

73
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:50,984
10 Say unto

74
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:51,484
the

75
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:51,984
righteous that it is

76
00:00:51,984 --> 00:00:52,484
well with

77
00:00:52,484 --> 00:00:52,984
them; for

78
00:00:52,984 --> 00:00:53,484
they shall eat

79
00:00:53,484 --> 00:00:53,984
the fruit of

80
00:00:53,984 --> 00:00:54,888
their doings.

81
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:58,638
11 Wo unto

82
00:00:58,638 --> 00:01:02,388
the wicked,

83
00:01:02,388 --> 00:01:06,138
for they

84
00:01:06,138 --> 00:01:09,888
shall

85
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:13,638
perish; for the

86
00:01:13,638 --> 00:01:17,388
reward of

87
00:01:17,388 --> 00:01:21,138
their hands

88
00:01:21,138 --> 00:01:24,685
shall be upon them!

89
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:24,885
12 And my

90
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:25,085
people,

91
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:25,285
children are

92
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:25,485
their

93
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:25,685
oppressors,

94
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:25,885
and women

95
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:26,085
rule over

96
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:26,285
them. O my

97
00:01:26,285 --> 00:01:26,485
people,

98
00:01:26,485 --> 00:01:26,685
they who

99
00:01:26,685 --> 00:01:26,885
lead thee

100
00:01:26,885 --> 00:01:27,085
cause thee to

101
00:01:27,085 --> 00:01:27,285
err and

102
00:01:27,285 --> 00:01:27,485
destroy the

103
00:01:27,485 --> 00:01:27,087
way of thy paths.

104
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,658
13 The

105
00:01:29,658 --> 00:01:32,229
Lord

106
00:01:32,229 --> 00:01:34,8
standeth up to

107
00:01:34,8 --> 00:01:37,371
plead,

108
00:01:37,371 --> 00:01:39,942
and

109
00:01:39,942 --> 00:01:42,513
standeth to

110
00:01:42,513 --> 00:01:45,439
judge the people.

111
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,386
14 The

112
00:01:46,386 --> 00:01:47,333
Lord will

113
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:48,28
enter

114
00:01:48,28 --> 00:01:49,227
into

115
00:01:49,227 --> 00:01:50,174
judgment

116
00:01:50,174 --> 00:01:51,121
with the

117
00:01:51,121 --> 00:01:52,068
ancients

118
00:01:52,068 --> 00:01:53,015
of his

119
00:01:53,015 --> 00:01:53,962
people and

120
00:01:53,962 --> 00:01:54,909
the

121
00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:55,856
princes

122
00:01:55,856 --> 00:01:56,803
thereof;

123
00:01:56,803 --> 00:01:57,75
for ye

124
00:01:57,75 --> 00:01:58,697
have eaten

125
00:01:58,697 --> 00:01:59,644
up the

126
00:01:59,644 --> 00:02:00,591
vineyard

127
00:02:00,591 --> 00:02:01,538
and the

128
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:02,485
spoil of

129
00:02:02,485 --> 00:02:03,323
the poor in your houses.

130
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:03,252
15 What

131
00:02:03,252 --> 00:02:03,181
mean

132
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:03,11
ye? Ye

133
00:02:03,11 --> 00:02:03,039
beat my

134
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:02,968
people

135
00:02:02,968 --> 00:02:02,897
to

136
00:02:02,897 --> 00:02:02,826
pieces, and

137
00:02:02,826 --> 00:02:02,755
grind

138
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:02,684
the

139
00:02:02,684 --> 00:02:02,613
faces of

140
00:02:02,613 --> 00:02:02,542
the

141
00:02:02,542 --> 00:02:02,471
poor, saith

142
00:02:02,471 --> 00:02:02,4
the

143
00:02:02,4 --> 00:02:02,389
Lord God of Hosts.

144
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:02,46
16

145
00:02:02,46 --> 00:02:02,531
Moreover,

146
00:02:02,531 --> 00:02:02,602
the

147
00:02:02,602 --> 00:02:02,673
Lord

148
00:02:02,673 --> 00:02:02,744
saith:

149
00:02:02,744 --> 00:02:02,815
Because

150
00:02:02,815 --> 00:02:02,886
the

151
00:02:02,886 --> 00:02:02,957


152
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:03,028
daughters of

153
00:02:03,028 --> 00:02:03,099
Zion

154
00:02:03,099 --> 00:02:03,17
are

155
00:02:03,17 --> 00:02:03,241
haughty,

156
00:02:03,241 --> 00:02:03,312
and

00:02:03,312 --> 00:02:03,383
walk

158
00:02:03,383 --> 00:02:03,454
with

159
00:02:03,454 --> 00:02:03,525


160
00:02:03,525 --> 00:02:03,596
stretched-forth

161
00:02:03,596 --> 00:02:03,667
necks

162
00:02:03,667 --> 00:02:03,738
and

163
00:02:03,738 --> 00:02:03,809
wanton

164
00:02:03,809 --> 00:02:03,88
eyes,

165
00:02:03,88 --> 00:02:03,951
walking

166
00:02:03,951 --> 00:02:04,022
and

167
00:02:04,022 --> 00:02:04,093
mincing

168
00:02:04,093 --> 00:02:04,164
as

169
00:02:04,164 --> 00:02:04,235
they go,

170
00:02:04,235 --> 00:02:04,306
and

171
00:02:04,306 --> 00:02:04,791
making a tinkling with their feet—

172
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:05,208
17

173
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:05,625


174
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,042
Therefore

175
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:06,459
the

head of

186
00:02:10,629 --> 00:02:11,046
the

188
00:02:11,463 --> 00:02:11,88

189
00:02:11,88 --> 00:02:12,297

193
00:02:13,548 --> 00:02:13,965
will

194
00:02:13,965 --> 00:02:14,382


195
00:02:14,382 --> 00:02:14,701
discover their secret parts.

196
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:14,981
18

197
00:02:14,981 --> 00:02:15,261
In

204
00:02:16,941 --> 00:02:17,221
take

205
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:17,501

206
00:02:17,501 --> 00:02:17,781
the
