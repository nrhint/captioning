00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,4
Chapter 13 Judah and Jerusalem will be punished

2
00:00:01,4 --> 00:00:02,8
 for their disobedience—The Lord pleads for and

3
00:00:02,8 --> 00:00:04,2
 judges His people—The daughters of Zion are cursed and

4
00:00:04,2 --> 00:00:05,6
 tormented for their worldliness—Compare 
Isaiah 3.

5
00:00:05,6 --> 00:00:07,0
 About 559–545 B.C.

6
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,975
1 For behold, the Lord, the Lord of Hosts, doth

7
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:11,975
 take away from Jerusalem, and from Judah, the stay

8
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:13,975
 and the staff, the whole staff of bread, and the

9
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:15,975
 whole stay of water

10
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:19,949
2 The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge,

11
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:23,949
 and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient

12
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:26,591
3 The captain of fifty, and the honorable man, and

13
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:29,258
 the counselor, and the cunning artificer, and the

14
00:00:29,258 --> 00:00:31,925
 eloquent orator

15
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:35,899
4 And I will give children unto them to be their

16
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:39,899
 princes, and babes shall rule over them

17
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,873
5 And the people shall be oppressed, every one by

18
00:00:41,873 --> 00:00:43,873
 another, and every one by his neighbor; the child

19
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:45,873
 shall behave himself proudly against the ancient,

20
00:00:45,873 --> 00:00:47,873
 and the base against the honorable

21
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,848
6 When a man shall take hold of his brother of the

22
00:00:49,848 --> 00:00:51,848
 house of his father, and shall say: Thou hast

23
00:00:51,848 --> 00:00:53,848
 clothing, be thou our ruler, and let not this ruin

24
00:00:53,848 --> 00:00:55,848
 come under thy hand

25
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:58,489
7 In that day shall he swear, saying: I will not

26
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:01,156
 be a healer; for in my house there is neither bread

27
00:01:01,156 --> 00:01:03,823
 nor clothing; make me not a ruler of the people

28
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:06,464
8 For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen,

29
00:01:06,464 --> 00:01:09,131
 because their tongues and their doings have been

30
00:01:09,131 --> 00:01:11,798
 against the Lord, to provoke the eyes of his glory

31
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:19,772
9 The show of their countenance doth witness

32
00:01:19,772 --> 00:01:27,772
 against them, and doth declare their sin to be even as

33
00:01:27,772 --> 00:01:35,772
 Sodom, and they cannot hide it. Wo unto their

34
00:01:35,772 --> 00:01:43,772
 souls, for they have rewarded evil unto themselves

35
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:55,67
10 Say unto the righteous that it is well with

36
00:01:55,67 --> 00:02:07,67
 them; for they shall eat the fruit of their doings

37
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:11,594
11 Wo unto the wicked, for they shall perish; for

38
00:02:11,594 --> 00:02:15,594
 the reward of their hands shall be upon them

39
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:21,569
12 And my people, children are their oppressors,

40
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:27,569
 and women rule over them. O my people, they who

41
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:33,569
 lead thee cause thee to err and destroy the way of

42
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:39,569
 thy paths

43
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:43,493
13 The Lord standeth up to plead, and standeth to

44
00:02:43,493 --> 00:02:47,493
 judge the people

45
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,467
14 The Lord will enter into judgment with the

46
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:51,467
 ancients of his people and the princes thereof; for ye

47
00:02:51,467 --> 00:02:53,467
 have eaten up the vineyard and the spoil of the

48
00:02:53,467 --> 00:02:55,467
 poor in your houses

49
00:02:55,442 --> 00:03:03,442
15 What mean ye? Ye beat my people to pieces, and

50
00:03:03,442 --> 00:03:11,442
 grind the faces of the poor, saith the Lord God of

51
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:19,442
 Hosts

52
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:23,366
16 Moreover, the Lord saith: Because the daughters

53
00:03:23,366 --> 00:03:27,366
 of Zion are haughty, and walk with

54
00:03:27,366 --> 00:03:31,366
 stretched-forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as

55
00:03:31,366 --> 00:03:35,366
 they go, and making a tinkling with their feet

56
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:40,648
17 Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the

57
00:03:40,648 --> 00:03:45,981
 crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the

58
00:03:45,981 --> 00:03:51,314
 Lord will discover their secret parts

59
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,931
18 In that day the Lord will take away the bravery

60
00:03:53,931 --> 00:03:56,598
 of their tinkling ornaments, and cauls, and round

61
00:03:56,598 --> 00:03:59,265
 tires like the moon

62
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,239
19 The chains and the bracelets, and the mufflers

63
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:07,239


64
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:12,547
20 The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and

65
00:04:12,547 --> 00:04:17,88
 the headbands, and the tablets, and the

66
00:04:17,88 --> 00:04:23,213
 ear-rings

67
00:04:23,163 --> 00:05:03,163
21 The rings, and nose jewels

68
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:26,536
22 The changeable suits of apparel, and the

69
00:05:26,536 --> 00:05:50,036
 mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping-pins

70
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:58,884
23 The glasses, and the fine linen, and hoods, and

71
00:05:58,884 --> 00:06:06,884
 the veils

72
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,433
24 And it shall come to pass, instead of sweet

73
00:06:08,433 --> 00:06:10,033
 smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle,

74
00:06:10,033 --> 00:06:11,633
 a rent; and instead of well set hair, baldness;

75
00:06:11,633 --> 00:06:13,233
 and instead of a stomacher, a girding of sackcloth;

76
00:06:13,233 --> 00:06:14,833
 burning instead of beauty

77
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:26,808
25 Thy men shall fall by the sword and thy mighty

78
00:06:26,808 --> 00:06:38,808
 in the war

79
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:39,232
26 And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she

80
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:39,732
 shall be desolate, and shall sit upon the ground.
