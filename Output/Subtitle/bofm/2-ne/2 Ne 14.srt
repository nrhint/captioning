00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 14 Zion and her daughters will be

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
redeemed and cleansed in the millennial

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:16:10,
day—Compare 
Isaiah 4. About 559–545 B.C. 

4
00:16:10,0 --> 00:16:10,0
1 And in that day, seven women shall

5
00:16:10,0 --> 00:16:10,0
take hold of one man, saying: We

6
00:16:10,0 --> 00:16:10,0
will eat our own bread, and wear our

7
00:16:10,0 --> 00:16:10,0
own apparel; only let us be called by

8
00:16:10,0 --> 00:31:38,
thy name to take away our reproach.

9
00:31:38,0 --> 00:31:38,0
2 In that day shall the

10
00:31:38,0 --> 00:31:38,0
branch of the Lord be beautiful

11
00:31:38,0 --> 00:31:38,0
and glorious; the fruit of the

12
00:31:38,0 --> 00:31:38,0
earth excellent and comely to

13
00:31:38,0 --> 00:33:50,
them that are escaped of Israel.

14
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
3 And it shall come to

15
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
pass, they that are left in

16
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
Zion and remain in

17
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
Jerusalem shall be called holy,

18
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
every one that is written

19
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,
among the living in Jerusalem—

20
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
4 When the Lord shall

21
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
have washed away the filth

22
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
of the daughters of

23
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
Zion, and shall have purged

24
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
the blood of Jerusalem

25
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
from the midst thereof

26
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
by the spirit of judgment

27
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,
and by the spirit of burning.

28
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
5 And the Lord will

29
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
create upon every

30
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
dwelling-place of mount Zion,

31
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
and upon her assemblies,

32
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
a cloud and smoke by

33
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
day and the shining of a

34
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
flaming fire by night;

35
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
for upon all the glory

36
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,
of Zion shall be a defence.

37
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
6 And there shall be

38
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
a tabernacle for a

39
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
shadow in the

40
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
daytime from the heat, and

41
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
for a place of

42
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
refuge, and a covert

43
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,
from storm and from rain.
