Chapter 14 Zion and her daughters will be redeemed

2
00:00:02,333 --> 00:00:04,666
 and cleansed in the millennial day—Compare

00:00:04,666 --> 00:00:06,999
Isaiah 4. About 559–545 B.C.

4
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,975
1 And in that day, seven women shall take hold of

5
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:11,975
 one man, saying: We will eat our own bread, and

6
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:13,975
 wear our own apparel; only let us be called by thy

7
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:15,975
 name to take away our reproach

8
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,616
2 In that day shall the branch of the Lord be

9
00:00:18,616 --> 00:00:21,283
 beautiful and glorious; the fruit of the earth

10
00:00:21,283 --> 00:00:23,95
 excellent and comely to them that are escaped of Israel

11
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,924
3 And it shall come to pass, they that are left in

12
00:00:25,924 --> 00:00:27,924
 Zion and remain in Jerusalem shall be called

13
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:29,924
 holy, every one that is written among the living in

14
00:00:29,924 --> 00:00:31,924
 Jerusalem

15
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,899
4 When the Lord shall have washed away the filth

16
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,899
 of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the

17
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:37,899
 blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the

18
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:39,899
 spirit of judgment and by the spirit of burning

19
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:44,673
5 And the Lord will create upon every

20
00:00:44,673 --> 00:00:49,473
 dwelling-place of mount Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud

21
00:00:49,473 --> 00:00:54,273
 and smoke by day and the shining of a flaming

22
00:00:54,273 --> 00:00:59,073
 fire by night; for upon all the glory of Zion shall

23
00:00:59,073 --> 00:01:03,873
 be a defence

24
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:04,13
6 And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in

25
00:01:04,13 --> 00:01:04,463
 the daytime from the heat, and for a place of

26
00:01:04,463 --> 00:01:04,796
 refuge, and a covert from storm and from rain.
