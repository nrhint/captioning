00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:08,667
Chapter 14 Zion and her daughters will be

2
00:00:08,667 --> 00:00:17,334
redeemed and cleansed in the millennial

3
00:00:17,334 --> 00:00:26,293
day—Compare 
Isaiah 4. About 559–545 B.C. 

4
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:27,693
1 And in that day, seven women shall

5
00:00:27,693 --> 00:00:29,093
take hold of one man, saying: We

6
00:00:29,093 --> 00:00:30,493
will eat our own bread, and wear our

7
00:00:30,493 --> 00:00:31,893
own apparel; only let us be called by

8
00:00:31,893 --> 00:00:33,333
thy name to take away our reproach.

9
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,333
2 In that day shall the

10
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:37,333
branch of the Lord be beautiful

11
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:39,333
and glorious; the fruit of the

12
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,333
earth excellent and comely to

13
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,677
them that are escaped of Israel.

14
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:46,677
3 And it shall come to

15
00:00:46,677 --> 00:00:49,677
pass, they that are left in

16
00:00:49,677 --> 00:00:52,677
Zion and remain in

17
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:55,677
Jerusalem shall be called holy,

18
00:00:55,677 --> 00:00:58,677
every one that is written

19
00:00:58,677 --> 00:01:01,528
among the living in Jerusalem—

20
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:04,028
4 When the Lord shall

21
00:01:04,028 --> 00:01:06,528
have washed away the filth

22
00:01:06,528 --> 00:01:09,028
of the daughters of

23
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:11,528
Zion, and shall have purged

24
00:01:11,528 --> 00:01:14,028
the blood of Jerusalem

25
00:01:14,028 --> 00:01:16,528
from the midst thereof

26
00:01:16,528 --> 00:01:19,028
by the spirit of judgment

27
00:01:19,028 --> 00:01:21,848
and by the spirit of burning.

28
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:21,737
5 And the Lord will

29
00:01:21,737 --> 00:01:21,626
create upon every

30
00:01:21,626 --> 00:01:21,515
dwelling-place of mount Zion,

31
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:21,404
and upon her assemblies,

32
00:01:21,404 --> 00:01:21,293
a cloud and smoke by

33
00:01:21,293 --> 00:01:21,182
day and the shining of a

34
00:01:21,182 --> 00:01:21,071
flaming fire by night;

35
00:01:21,071 --> 00:01:20,96
for upon all the glory

36
00:01:20,96 --> 00:01:20,914
of Zion shall be a defence.

37
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:21,2
6 And there shall be

38
00:01:21,2 --> 00:01:21,486
a tabernacle for a

39
00:01:21,486 --> 00:01:21,772
shadow in the

40
00:01:21,772 --> 00:01:22,058
daytime from the heat, and

41
00:01:22,058 --> 00:01:22,344
for a place of

42
00:01:22,344 --> 00:01:22,63
refuge, and a covert

43
00:01:22,63 --> 00:01:22,382
from storm and from rain.
