Chapter 7 Jacob continues reading from Isaiah:

2
00:00:10,4 --> 00:00:20,8
 Isaiah speaks messianically—The Messiah will have the

3
00:00:20,8 --> 00:00:31,2
 tongue of the learned—He will give His back to

4
00:00:31,2 --> 00:00:41,6
 the smiters—He will not be confounded—Compare

5
00:00:41,6 --> 00:00:52,0
Isaiah 50. About 559–545 B.C.

6
00:00:52,085 --> 00:01:01,585
1 Yea, for thus saith the Lord: Have I put thee

7
00:01:01,585 --> 00:01:11,085
 away, or have I cast thee off forever? For thus

8
00:01:11,085 --> 00:01:20,585
 saith the Lord: Where is the bill of your mother’s

9
00:01:20,585 --> 00:01:30,085
 divorcement? To whom have I put thee away, or to

10
00:01:30,085 --> 00:01:39,585
 which of my creditors have I sold you? Yea, to whom

11
00:01:39,585 --> 00:01:49,085
 have I sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have ye

12
00:01:49,085 --> 00:01:58,585
 sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is

13
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:08,085
 your mother put away

14
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:18,695
2 Wherefore, when I came, there was no man; when I

15
00:02:18,695 --> 00:02:28,695
 called, yea, there was none to answer. O house of

16
00:02:28,695 --> 00:02:38,695
 Israel, is my hand shortened at all that it

17
00:02:38,695 --> 00:02:48,695
 cannot redeem, or have I no power to deliver? Behold,

18
00:02:48,695 --> 00:02:58,695
 at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make their rivers

19
00:02:58,695 --> 00:03:08,695
 a wilderness and their fish to stink because the

20
00:03:08,695 --> 00:03:18,695
 waters are dried up, and they die because of

21
00:03:18,695 --> 00:03:28,695
 thirst

22
00:03:28,442 --> 00:04:28,442
3 I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make

23
00:04:28,442 --> 00:05:28,442
 sackcloth their covering

24
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:46,388
6 I gave my back to the smiter, and my cheeks to

25
00:01:46,388 --> 00:02:05,055
 them that plucked off the hair. I hid not my face

26
00:02:05,055 --> 00:02:23,722
 from shame and spitting

27
00:02:23,543 --> 00:03:04,293
7 For the Lord God will help me, therefore shall I

28
00:03:04,293 --> 00:03:45,043
 not be confounded. Therefore have I set my face

29
00:03:45,043 --> 00:04:25,793
 like a flint, and I know that I shall not be

30
00:04:25,793 --> 00:05:06,543
 ashamed

31
00:05:06,84 --> 00:05:14,59
8 And the Lord is near, and he justifieth me. Who

32
00:05:14,59 --> 00:05:22,34
 will contend with me? Let us stand together. Who

33
00:05:22,34 --> 00:05:30,09
 is mine adversary? Let him come near me, and I will

34
00:05:30,09 --> 00:05:37,84
 smite him with the strength of my mouth

35
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:27,921
11 Behold all ye that kindle fire, that compass

36
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:28,121
 yourselves about with sparks, walk in the light of

37
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:28,321
 your fire and in the sparks which ye have kindled.

38
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:28,521
 This shall ye have of mine hand—ye shall lie down

39
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:28,721
 in sorrow.
