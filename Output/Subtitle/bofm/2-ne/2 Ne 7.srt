Chapter 7 Jacob continues reading from

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Isaiah: Isaiah speaks messianically—The Messiah

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
will have the tongue of the learned—He will give

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
His back to the smiters—He will not be

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:03:45,
confounded—Compare 
Isaiah 50. About 559–545 B.C. 

6
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
1 Yea, for thus saith the Lord: Have I

7
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
put thee away, or have I cast thee off

8
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
forever? For thus saith the Lord: Where is

9
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
the bill of your mother’s divorcement? To

10
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
whom have I put thee away, or to which of

11
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
my creditors have I sold you? Yea, to

12
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
whom have I sold you? Behold, for your

13
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for

14
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:31,
your transgressions is your mother put away.

15
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
2 Wherefore, when I came, there was no

16
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
man; when I called, yea, there was none

17
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
to answer. O house of Israel, is my

18
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
hand shortened at all that it cannot

19
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
redeem, or have I no power to deliver?

20
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I

21
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
make their rivers a wilderness and their

22
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
fish to stink because the waters are

23
00:03:31,0 --> 00:05:15,
dried up, and they die because of thirst.

24
00:05:15,0 --> 00:05:15,0
3 I clothe the heavens with

25
00:05:15,0 --> 00:19:24,
blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.

26
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
4 The Lord God hath given me the

27
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
tongue of the learned, that I

28
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
should know how to speak a word

29
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
in season unto thee, O house of

30
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
Israel. When ye are weary he

31
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
waketh morning by morning. He waketh

32
00:19:24,0 --> 00:24:34,
mine ear to hear as the learned.

33
00:24:34,0 --> 00:24:34,0
5 The Lord God hath opened

34
00:24:34,0 --> 00:24:34,0
mine ear, and I was not

35
00:24:34,0 --> 00:24:06,
rebellious, neither turned away back.

36
00:24:06,0 --> 00:24:06,0
6 I gave my back to the

37
00:24:06,0 --> 00:24:06,0
smiter, and my cheeks to

38
00:24:06,0 --> 00:24:06,0
them that plucked off

39
00:24:06,0 --> 00:24:06,0
the hair. I hid not my

40
00:24:06,0 --> 00:23:38,
face from shame and spitting.

41
00:23:38,0 --> 00:23:38,0
7 For the Lord God

42
00:23:38,0 --> 00:23:38,0
will help me, therefore

43
00:23:38,0 --> 00:23:38,0
shall I not be

44
00:23:38,0 --> 00:23:38,0
confounded. Therefore have

45
00:23:38,0 --> 00:23:38,0
I set my face like a

46
00:23:38,0 --> 00:23:38,0
flint, and I know

47
00:23:38,0 --> 00:25:50,
that I shall not be ashamed.

48
00:25:50,0 --> 00:25:50,0
8 And the Lord is

49
00:25:50,0 --> 00:25:50,0
near, and he

50
00:25:50,0 --> 00:25:50,0
justifieth me. Who will

51
00:25:50,0 --> 00:25:50,0
contend with me? Let

52
00:25:50,0 --> 00:25:50,0
us stand together.

53
00:25:50,0 --> 00:25:50,0
Who is mine

54
00:25:50,0 --> 00:25:50,0
adversary? Let him come

55
00:25:50,0 --> 00:25:50,0
near me, and I will

56
00:25:50,0 --> 00:25:50,0
smite him with the

57
00:25:50,0 --> 00:32:00,
strength of my mouth.

58
00:32:00,0 --> 00:32:00,0
9 For the Lord God

59
00:32:00,0 --> 00:32:00,0
will help me. And

60
00:32:00,0 --> 00:32:00,0
all they who

61
00:32:00,0 --> 00:32:00,0
shall condemn me,

62
00:32:00,0 --> 00:32:00,0
behold, all they shall

63
00:32:00,0 --> 00:32:00,0
wax old as a

64
00:32:00,0 --> 00:32:00,0
garment, and the moth

65
00:32:00,0 --> 00:33:30,
shall eat them up.

66
00:33:30,0 --> 00:33:30,0
10 Who is among

67
00:33:30,0 --> 00:33:30,0
you that feareth

68
00:33:30,0 --> 00:33:30,0
the Lord, that

69
00:33:30,0 --> 00:33:30,0
obeyeth the voice of

70
00:33:30,0 --> 00:33:30,0
his servant,

71
00:33:30,0 --> 00:33:30,0
that walketh in

72
00:33:30,0 --> 00:46:56,
darkness and hath no light?

73
00:46:56,0 --> 00:46:56,0
11 Behold all ye

74
00:46:56,0 --> 00:46:56,0
that kindle

75
00:46:56,0 --> 00:46:56,0
fire, that compass

76
00:46:56,0 --> 00:46:56,0
yourselves about

77
00:46:56,0 --> 00:46:56,0
with sparks,

78
00:46:56,0 --> 00:46:56,0
walk in the light

79
00:46:56,0 --> 00:46:56,0
of your fire and

80
00:46:56,0 --> 00:46:56,0
in the sparks

81
00:46:56,0 --> 00:46:56,0
which ye have

82
00:46:56,0 --> 00:46:56,0
kindled. This shall

83
00:46:56,0 --> 00:46:56,0
ye have of mine

84
00:46:56,0 --> 00:46:56,0
hand—ye shall

85
00:46:56,0 --> 00:48:26,
lie down in sorrow.
