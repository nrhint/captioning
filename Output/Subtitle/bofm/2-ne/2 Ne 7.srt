00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,6
Chapter 7 Jacob continues reading from

2
00:00:01,6 --> 00:00:03,2
Isaiah: Isaiah speaks messianically—The Messiah

3
00:00:03,2 --> 00:00:04,8
will have the tongue of the learned—He will give

4
00:00:04,8 --> 00:00:06,4
His back to the smiters—He will not be

5
00:00:06,4 --> 00:00:08,442
confounded—Compare 
Isaiah 50. About 559–545 B.C. 

6
00:00:08,442 --> 00:00:09,775
1 Yea, for thus saith the Lord: Have I

7
00:00:09,775 --> 00:00:11,108
put thee away, or have I cast thee off

8
00:00:11,108 --> 00:00:12,441
forever? For thus saith the Lord: Where is

9
00:00:12,441 --> 00:00:13,774
the bill of your mother’s divorcement? To

10
00:00:13,774 --> 00:00:15,107
whom have I put thee away, or to which of

11
00:00:15,107 --> 00:00:16,44
my creditors have I sold you? Yea, to

12
00:00:16,44 --> 00:00:17,773
whom have I sold you? Behold, for your

13
00:00:17,773 --> 00:00:19,106
iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for

14
00:00:19,106 --> 00:00:20,32
your transgressions is your mother put away.

15
00:00:20,32 --> 00:00:23,098
2 Wherefore, when I came, there was no

16
00:00:23,098 --> 00:00:25,876
man; when I called, yea, there was none

17
00:00:25,876 --> 00:00:28,654
to answer. O house of Israel, is my

18
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:31,432
hand shortened at all that it cannot

19
00:00:31,432 --> 00:00:34,21
redeem, or have I no power to deliver?

20
00:00:34,21 --> 00:00:36,988
Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I

21
00:00:36,988 --> 00:00:39,766
make their rivers a wilderness and their

22
00:00:39,766 --> 00:00:42,544
fish to stink because the waters are

23
00:00:42,544 --> 00:00:45,712
dried up, and they die because of thirst.

24
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,212
3 I clothe the heavens with

25
00:00:47,212 --> 00:00:48,115
blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.

26
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:47,972
4 The Lord God hath given me the

27
00:00:47,972 --> 00:00:47,829
tongue of the learned, that I

28
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:47,686
should know how to speak a word

29
00:00:47,686 --> 00:00:47,543
in season unto thee, O house of

30
00:00:47,543 --> 00:00:47,4
Israel. When ye are weary he

31
00:00:47,4 --> 00:00:47,257
waketh morning by morning. He waketh

32
00:00:47,257 --> 00:00:47,18
mine ear to hear as the learned.

33
00:00:47,18 --> 00:00:48,513
5 The Lord God hath opened

34
00:00:48,513 --> 00:00:49,846
mine ear, and I was not

35
00:00:49,846 --> 00:00:51,585
rebellious, neither turned away back.

36
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:54,385
6 I gave my back to the

37
00:00:54,385 --> 00:00:57,185
smiter, and my cheeks to

38
00:00:57,185 --> 00:00:59,985
them that plucked off

39
00:00:59,985 --> 00:01:02,785
the hair. I hid not my

40
00:01:02,785 --> 00:01:05,866
face from shame and spitting.

41
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:13,58
7 For the Lord God

42
00:01:13,58 --> 00:01:21,294
will help me, therefore

43
00:01:21,294 --> 00:01:29,008
shall I not be

44
00:01:29,008 --> 00:01:36,722
confounded. Therefore have

45
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:44,436
I set my face like a

46
00:01:44,436 --> 00:01:52,15
flint, and I know

47
00:01:52,15 --> 00:01:59,586
that I shall not be ashamed.

48
00:01:59,586 --> 00:01:59,486
8 And the Lord is

49
00:01:59,486 --> 00:01:59,386
near, and he

50
00:01:59,386 --> 00:01:59,286
justifieth me. Who will

51
00:01:59,286 --> 00:01:59,186
contend with me? Let

52
00:01:59,186 --> 00:01:59,086
us stand together.

53
00:01:59,086 --> 00:01:58,986
Who is mine

54
00:01:58,986 --> 00:01:58,886
adversary? Let him come

55
00:01:58,886 --> 00:01:58,786
near me, and I will

56
00:01:58,786 --> 00:01:58,686
smite him with the

57
00:01:58,686 --> 00:01:58,652
strength of my mouth.

58
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:00,402
9 For the Lord God

59
00:02:00,402 --> 00:02:02,152
will help me. And

60
00:02:02,152 --> 00:02:03,902
all they who

61
00:02:03,902 --> 00:02:05,652
shall condemn me,

62
00:02:05,652 --> 00:02:07,402
behold, all they shall

63
00:02:07,402 --> 00:02:09,152
wax old as a

64
00:02:09,152 --> 00:02:10,902
garment, and the moth

65
00:02:10,902 --> 00:02:12,499
shall eat them up.

66
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,07
10 Who is among

67
00:02:14,07 --> 00:02:15,641
you that feareth

68
00:02:15,641 --> 00:02:17,212
the Lord, that

69
00:02:17,212 --> 00:02:18,783
obeyeth the voice of

70
00:02:18,783 --> 00:02:20,354
his servant,

71
00:02:20,354 --> 00:02:21,925
that walketh in

72
00:02:21,925 --> 00:02:23,944
darkness and hath no light?

73
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:24,79
11 Behold all ye

74
00:02:24,79 --> 00:02:25,636
that kindle

75
00:02:25,636 --> 00:02:26,482
fire, that compass

76
00:02:26,482 --> 00:02:27,328
yourselves about

77
00:02:27,328 --> 00:02:28,174
with sparks,

78
00:02:28,174 --> 00:02:29,02
walk in the light

79
00:02:29,02 --> 00:02:29,866
of your fire and

80
00:02:29,866 --> 00:02:30,712
in the sparks

81
00:02:30,712 --> 00:02:31,558
which ye have

82
00:02:31,558 --> 00:02:32,404
kindled. This shall

83
00:02:32,404 --> 00:02:33,25
ye have of mine

84
00:02:33,25 --> 00:02:34,096
hand—ye shall

85
00:02:34,096 --> 00:02:34,321
lie down in sorrow.
