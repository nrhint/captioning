1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,75
Chapter 18 Christ will be as a stone of stumbling

2
00:00:01,75 --> 00:00:03,5
 and a rock of offense—Seek the Lord, not peeping

3
00:00:03,5 --> 00:00:05,25
 wizards—Turn to the law and to the testimony for

4
00:00:05,25 --> 00:00:07,0
 guidance—Compare 
Isaiah 8. About 559–545 B.C.

5
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:10,642
1 Moreover, the word of the Lord said unto me:

6
00:00:10,642 --> 00:00:13,309
 Take thee a great roll, and write in it with a man’s

7
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:15,976
 pen, concerning Maher-shalal-hash-baz

8
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,616
2 And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record,

9
00:00:18,616 --> 00:00:21,283
 Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of

10
00:00:21,283 --> 00:00:23,95
 Jeberechiah

11
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:26,591
3 And I went unto the prophetess; and she

12
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:29,258
 conceived and bare a son. Then said the Lord to me: Call

13
00:00:29,258 --> 00:00:31,925
 his name, Maher-shalal-hash-baz

14
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,899
4 For behold, the child shall not have knowledge

15
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,899
 to cry, My father, and my mother, before the riches

16
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:37,899
 of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be

17
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:39,899
 taken away before the king of Assyria

18
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:47,873
5 The Lord spake also unto me again, saying

19
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:55,848
6 Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of

20
00:00:55,848 --> 00:01:03,848
 Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and

21
00:01:03,848 --> 00:01:11,848
 Remaliah’s son

22
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:13,372
7 Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon

23
00:01:13,372 --> 00:01:14,972
 them the waters of the river, strong and many,

24
00:01:14,972 --> 00:01:16,572
 even the king of Assyria and all his glory; and he

25
00:01:16,572 --> 00:01:18,172
 shall come up over all his channels, and go over

26
00:01:18,172 --> 00:01:19,772
 all his banks

27
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:25,746
8 And he shall pass through Judah; he shall

28
00:01:25,746 --> 00:01:31,746
 overflow and go over, he shall reach even to the neck;

29
00:01:31,746 --> 00:01:37,746
 and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the

30
00:01:37,746 --> 00:01:43,746
 breadth of thy land, O Immanuel

31
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:45,27
9 Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall

32
00:01:45,27 --> 00:01:46,87
 be broken in pieces; and give ear all ye of far

33
00:01:46,87 --> 00:01:48,47
 countries; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken

34
00:01:48,47 --> 00:01:50,07
 in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken

35
00:01:50,07 --> 00:01:51,67
 in pieces

36
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:54,312
10 Take counsel together, and it shall come to

37
00:01:54,312 --> 00:01:56,979
 naught; speak the word, and it shall not stand; for

38
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:59,646
 God is with us

39
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:02,287
11 For the Lord spake thus to me with a strong

40
00:02:02,287 --> 00:02:04,954
 hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the

41
00:02:04,954 --> 00:02:07,621
 way of this people, saying

42
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:10,261
12 Say ye not, A confederacy, to all to whom this

43
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:12,928
 people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye

44
00:02:12,928 --> 00:02:15,595
 their fear, nor be afraid

45
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:19,569
13 Sanctify the Lord of Hosts himself, and let him

46
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:23,569
 be your fear, and let him be your dread

47
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:31,543
14 And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a

48
00:02:31,543 --> 00:02:39,543
 stone of stumbling, and for a rock of offense to both

49
00:02:39,543 --> 00:02:47,543
 the houses of Israel, for a gin and a snare to the

50
00:02:47,543 --> 00:02:55,543
 inhabitants of Jerusalem

51
00:02:55,442 --> 00:03:03,442
15 And many among them shall stumble and fall, and

52
00:03:03,442 --> 00:03:11,442
 be broken, and be snared, and be taken

53
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:19,391
16 Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my

54
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:27,391
 disciples

55
00:03:27,34 --> 00:03:30,007
17 And I will wait upon the Lord, that hideth his

56
00:03:30,007 --> 00:03:32,674
 face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for

57
00:03:32,674 --> 00:03:35,341
 him

58
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,315
18 Behold, I and the children whom the Lord hath

59
00:03:37,315 --> 00:03:39,315
 given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel

60
00:03:39,315 --> 00:03:41,315
 from the Lord of Hosts, which dwelleth in Mount

61
00:03:41,315 --> 00:03:43,315
 Zion

62
00:03:43,29 --> 00:03:45,29
19 And when they shall say unto you: Seek unto

63
00:03:45,29 --> 00:03:47,29
 them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards

64
00:03:47,29 --> 00:03:49,29
 that peep and mutter—should not a people seek unto

65
00:03:49,29 --> 00:03:51,29
 their God for the living to hear from the dead

66
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,931
20 To the law and to the testimony; and if they

67
00:03:53,931 --> 00:03:56,598
 speak not according to this word, it is because

68
00:03:56,598 --> 00:03:59,265
 there is no light in them

69
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,239
21 And they shall pass through it hardly bestead

70
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:03,239
 and hungry; and it shall come to pass that when

71
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,239
 they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and

72
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:07,239
 curse their king and their God, and look upward

73
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:07,214
22 And they shall look unto the earth and behold

74
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:07,214
 trouble, and darkness, dimness of anguish, and

75
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:07,214
 shall be driven to darkness.
