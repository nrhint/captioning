00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 18 Christ will be as a stone of

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
stumbling and a rock of offense—Seek the Lord, not

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
peeping wizards—Turn to the law and to the testimony

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:04:43,
for guidance—Compare 
Isaiah 8. About 559–545 B.C. 

5
00:04:43,0 --> 00:04:43,0
1 Moreover, the word of the Lord said unto me:

6
00:04:43,0 --> 00:04:43,0
Take thee a great roll, and write in it with

7
00:04:43,0 --> 00:08:13,
a man’s pen, concerning Maher-shalal-hash-baz.

8
00:08:13,0 --> 00:08:13,0
2 And I took unto me faithful

9
00:08:13,0 --> 00:08:13,0
witnesses to record, Uriah the priest,

10
00:08:13,0 --> 00:22:37,
and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.

11
00:22:37,0 --> 00:22:37,0
3 And I went unto the

12
00:22:37,0 --> 00:22:37,0
prophetess; and she conceived and bare a

13
00:22:37,0 --> 00:22:37,0
son. Then said the Lord to me:

14
00:22:37,0 --> 00:25:19,
Call his name, Maher-shalal-hash-baz.

15
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
4 For behold, the child shall

16
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
not have knowledge to cry, My

17
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
father, and my mother, before

18
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
the riches of Damascus and the

19
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
spoil of Samaria shall be

20
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,
taken away before the king of Assyria.

21
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
5 The Lord spake also

22
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,
unto me again, saying:

23
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
6 Forasmuch as this

24
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
people refuseth

25
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
the waters of Shiloah

26
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
that go softly,

27
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
and rejoice in Rezin

28
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,
and Remaliah’s son;

29
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
7 Now therefore,

30
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
behold, the Lord

31
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
bringeth up upon

32
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
them the waters

33
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
of the river,

34
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
strong and many, even

35
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
the king of

36
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
Assyria and all his

37
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
glory; and he

38
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
shall come up over

39
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
all his channels,

40
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,
and go over all his banks.

41
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
8 And he shall

42
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
pass through

43
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
Judah; he shall

44
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
overflow and go

45
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
over, he shall reach

46
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
even to the

47
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
neck; and the

48
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
stretching out of his

49
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
wings shall

50
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
fill the breadth of

51
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,
thy land, O Immanuel.

52
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
9 Associate

53
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
yourselves, O ye

54
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
people, and ye

55
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
shall be broken

56
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
in pieces; and

57
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
give ear all ye

58
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
of far

59
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
countries; gird

60
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
yourselves, and ye

61
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
shall be broken

62
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
in pieces; gird

63
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
yourselves, and

64
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
ye shall be

65
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,
broken in pieces.

66
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
10 Take

67
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
counsel together,

68
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
and it shall

69
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
come to naught;

70
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
speak the word,

71
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
and it shall

72
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
not stand; for

73
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,
God is with us.

74
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
11 For the

75
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
Lord spake

76
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
thus to me

77
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
with a strong

78
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
hand, and

79
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
instructed me

80
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
that I should

81
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
not walk in

82
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
the way of

83
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,
this people, saying:

84
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
12 Say ye

85
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
not, A

86
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
confederacy, to

87
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
all to whom

88
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
this

89
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
people shall

90
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
say, A

91
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
confederacy;

92
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
neither fear ye

93
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
their fear,

94
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,
nor be afraid.

95
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
13

96
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
Sanctify the Lord

97
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
of Hosts

98
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
himself,

99
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
and let him

100
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
be your

101
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
fear, and

102
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
let him be

103
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,
your dread.

104
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
14 And he

105
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
shall be

106
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
for a

107
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
sanctuary;

108
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
but for a

109
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
stone of

110
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0


111
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
stumbling, and

112
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
for a rock

113
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
of

114
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
offense to both

115
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
the

116
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
houses of

117
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
Israel, for

118
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
a gin and

119
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
a snare

120
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
to the

121
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,
inhabitants of Jerusalem.

122
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
15 And

123
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
many among

124
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
them

125
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
shall stumble

126
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
and

127
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
fall, and be

128
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
broken,

129
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
and be

130
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
snared, and

131
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,
be taken.

132
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
16 Bind

133
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
up the

134
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0


135
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
testimony, seal

136
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
the law

137
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
among my

138
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,
disciples.

139
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
17 And I

140
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
will

141
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
wait upon

142
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
the

143
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
Lord, that

144
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
hideth

145
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
his face

146
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
from the

147
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
house of

148
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
Jacob,

149
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
and I

150
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
will look

151
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,
for him.

152
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
18

153
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
Behold, I

154
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
and the

155
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0


156
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
children whom

157
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
the

158
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
Lord hath

159
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
given

160
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
me are

161
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
for

162
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
signs and

163
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
for

164
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
wonders in

165
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
Israel

166
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
from

167
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
the Lord

168
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
of

169
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
Hosts,

170
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,
which dwelleth in Mount Zion.

171
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
19 And

172
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
when

173
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
they

174
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
shall

175
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
say

176
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
unto you:

177
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
Seek

178
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
unto

179
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
them

180
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
that

181
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
have

182
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
familiar

183
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0


184
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
spirits, and

185
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
unto

186
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
wizards

187
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
that

188
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
peep

189
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
and

190
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0


191
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
mutter—should

192
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
not a

193
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
people

194
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
seek

195
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
unto

196
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
their

197
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
God for

198
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,
the living to hear from the dead?

199
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
20 To

200
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
the

201
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
law

202
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
and to

203
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
the

204
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0


205
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
testimony;

206
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
and

207
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
if

208
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
they

209
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
speak

210
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
not

211
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0


212
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
according to

213
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
this

214
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0


215
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
word, it

216
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
is

217
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
because

218
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0


219
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,
there is no light in them.

220
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
21

221
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
And

222
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
they

223
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0


224
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
shall

225
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
pass

226
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0


227
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
through

228
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
it

229
00:25:19,0 --> 00:25:19,0
hardly
