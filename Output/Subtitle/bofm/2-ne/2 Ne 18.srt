00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:03,5
Chapter 18 Christ will be as a stone of

2
00:00:03,5 --> 00:00:07,0
stumbling and a rock of offense—Seek the Lord, not

3
00:00:07,0 --> 00:00:10,5
peeping wizards—Turn to the law and to the testimony

4
00:00:10,5 --> 00:00:14,982
for guidance—Compare 
Isaiah 8. About 559–545 B.C. 

5
00:00:14,982 --> 00:00:14,982
1 Moreover, the word of the Lord said unto me:

6
00:00:14,982 --> 00:00:14,982
Take thee a great roll, and write in it with

7
00:00:14,982 --> 00:00:14,047
a man’s pen, concerning Maher-shalal-hash-baz.

8
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:20,38
2 And I took unto me faithful

9
00:00:20,38 --> 00:00:26,713
witnesses to record, Uriah the priest,

10
00:00:26,713 --> 00:00:33,934
and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.

11
00:00:33,934 --> 00:00:35,184
3 And I went unto the

12
00:00:35,184 --> 00:00:36,434
prophetess; and she conceived and bare a

13
00:00:36,434 --> 00:00:37,684
son. Then said the Lord to me:

14
00:00:37,684 --> 00:00:38,872
Call his name, Maher-shalal-hash-baz.

15
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:39,372
4 For behold, the child shall

16
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:39,872
not have knowledge to cry, My

17
00:00:39,872 --> 00:00:40,372
father, and my mother, before

18
00:00:40,372 --> 00:00:40,872
the riches of Damascus and the

19
00:00:40,872 --> 00:00:41,372
spoil of Samaria shall be

20
00:00:41,372 --> 00:00:41,275
taken away before the king of Assyria.

21
00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:47,775
5 The Lord spake also

22
00:00:47,775 --> 00:00:54,187
unto me again, saying:

23
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:54,02
6 Forasmuch as this

24
00:00:54,02 --> 00:00:53,853
people refuseth

25
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:53,686
the waters of Shiloah

26
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:53,519
that go softly,

27
00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:53,352
and rejoice in Rezin

28
00:00:53,352 --> 00:00:53,253
and Remaliah’s son;

29
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:53,17
7 Now therefore,

30
00:00:53,17 --> 00:00:53,087
behold, the Lord

31
00:00:53,087 --> 00:00:53,004
bringeth up upon

32
00:00:53,004 --> 00:00:52,921
them the waters

33
00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:52,838
of the river,

34
00:00:52,838 --> 00:00:52,755
strong and many, even

35
00:00:52,755 --> 00:00:52,672
the king of

36
00:00:52,672 --> 00:00:52,589
Assyria and all his

37
00:00:52,589 --> 00:00:52,506
glory; and he

38
00:00:52,506 --> 00:00:52,423
shall come up over

39
00:00:52,423 --> 00:00:52,34
all his channels,

40
00:00:52,34 --> 00:00:52,319
and go over all his banks.

41
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:52,228
8 And he shall

42
00:00:52,228 --> 00:00:52,137
pass through

43
00:00:52,137 --> 00:00:52,046
Judah; he shall

44
00:00:52,046 --> 00:00:51,955
overflow and go

45
00:00:51,955 --> 00:00:51,864
over, he shall reach

46
00:00:51,864 --> 00:00:51,773
even to the

47
00:00:51,773 --> 00:00:51,682
neck; and the

48
00:00:51,682 --> 00:00:51,591
stretching out of his

49
00:00:51,591 --> 00:00:51,5
wings shall

50
00:00:51,5 --> 00:00:51,409
fill the breadth of

51
00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:51,385
thy land, O Immanuel.

52
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:51,314
9 Associate

53
00:00:51,314 --> 00:00:51,243
yourselves, O ye

54
00:00:51,243 --> 00:00:51,172
people, and ye

55
00:00:51,172 --> 00:00:51,101
shall be broken

56
00:00:51,101 --> 00:00:51,03
in pieces; and

57
00:00:51,03 --> 00:00:50,959
give ear all ye

58
00:00:50,959 --> 00:00:50,888
of far

59
00:00:50,888 --> 00:00:50,817
countries; gird

60
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:50,746
yourselves, and ye

61
00:00:50,746 --> 00:00:50,675
shall be broken

62
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:50,604
in pieces; gird

63
00:00:50,604 --> 00:00:50,533
yourselves, and

64
00:00:50,533 --> 00:00:50,462
ye shall be

65
00:00:50,462 --> 00:00:50,918
broken in pieces.

66
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:50,793
10 Take

67
00:00:50,793 --> 00:00:50,668
counsel together,

68
00:00:50,668 --> 00:00:50,543
and it shall

69
00:00:50,543 --> 00:00:50,418
come to naught;

70
00:00:50,418 --> 00:00:50,293
speak the word,

71
00:00:50,293 --> 00:00:50,168
and it shall

72
00:00:50,168 --> 00:00:50,043
not stand; for

73
00:00:50,043 --> 00:00:49,983
God is with us.

74
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:49,983
11 For the

75
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:49,983
Lord spake

76
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:49,983
thus to me

77
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:49,983
with a strong

78
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:49,983
hand, and

79
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:49,983
instructed me

80
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:49,983
that I should

81
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:49,983
not walk in

82
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:49,983
the way of

83
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:49,516
this people, saying:

84
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:49,88
12 Say ye

85
00:00:49,88 --> 00:00:50,244
not, A

86
00:00:50,244 --> 00:00:50,608
confederacy, to

87
00:00:50,608 --> 00:00:50,972
all to whom

88
00:00:50,972 --> 00:00:51,336
this

89
00:00:51,336 --> 00:00:51,7
people shall

90
00:00:51,7 --> 00:00:52,064
say, A

91
00:00:52,064 --> 00:00:52,428
confederacy;

92
00:00:52,428 --> 00:00:52,792
neither fear ye

93
00:00:52,792 --> 00:00:53,156
their fear,

94
00:00:53,156 --> 00:00:53,453
nor be afraid.

95
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:54,231
13

96
00:00:54,231 --> 00:00:55,009
Sanctify the Lord

97
00:00:55,009 --> 00:00:55,787
of Hosts

98
00:00:55,787 --> 00:00:56,565
himself,

99
00:00:56,565 --> 00:00:57,343
and let him

100
00:00:57,343 --> 00:00:58,121
be your

101
00:00:58,121 --> 00:00:58,899
fear, and

102
00:00:58,899 --> 00:00:59,677
let him be

103
00:00:59,677 --> 00:01:00,46
your dread.

104
00:01:00,46 --> 00:01:01,016
14 And he

105
00:01:01,016 --> 00:01:01,572
shall be

106
00:01:01,572 --> 00:01:02,128
for a

107
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:02,684
sanctuary;

108
00:01:02,684 --> 00:01:03,24
but for a

109
00:01:03,24 --> 00:01:03,796
stone of

110
00:01:03,796 --> 00:01:04,352


111
00:01:04,352 --> 00:01:04,908
stumbling, and

112
00:01:04,908 --> 00:01:05,464
for a rock

113
00:01:05,464 --> 00:01:06,02
of

114
00:01:06,02 --> 00:01:06,576
offense to both

115
00:01:06,576 --> 00:01:07,132
the

116
00:01:07,132 --> 00:01:07,688
houses of

117
00:01:07,688 --> 00:01:08,244
Israel, for

118
00:01:08,244 --> 00:01:08,8
a gin and

119
00:01:08,8 --> 00:01:09,356
a snare

120
00:01:09,356 --> 00:01:09,912
to the

121
00:01:09,912 --> 00:01:10,37
inhabitants of Jerusalem.

122
00:01:10,37 --> 00:01:10,67
15 And

123
00:01:10,67 --> 00:01:10,97
many among

124
00:01:10,97 --> 00:01:11,27
them

125
00:01:11,27 --> 00:01:11,57
shall stumble

126
00:01:11,57 --> 00:01:11,87
and

127
00:01:11,87 --> 00:01:12,17
fall, and be

128
00:01:12,17 --> 00:01:12,47
broken,

129
00:01:12,47 --> 00:01:12,77
and be

130
00:01:12,77 --> 00:01:13,07
snared, and

131
00:01:13,07 --> 00:01:13,84
be taken.

132
00:01:13,84 --> 00:01:13,697
16 Bind

133
00:01:13,697 --> 00:01:13,554
up the

134
00:01:13,554 --> 00:01:13,411


135
00:01:13,411 --> 00:01:13,268
testimony, seal

136
00:01:13,268 --> 00:01:13,125
the law

137
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:12,982
among my

138
00:01:12,982 --> 00:01:12,906
disciples.

139
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:12,906
17 And I

140
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:12,906
will

141
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:12,906
wait upon

142
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:12,906
the

143
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:12,906
Lord, that

144
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:12,906
hideth

145
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:12,906
his face

146
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:12,906
from the

147
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:12,906
house of

148
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:12,906
Jacob,

149
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:12,906
and I

150
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:12,906
will look

151
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:12,439
for him.

152
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:12,597
18

153
00:01:12,597 --> 00:01:12,755
Behold, I

154
00:01:12,755 --> 00:01:12,913
and the

155
00:01:12,913 --> 00:01:13,071


156
00:01:13,071 --> 00:01:13,229
children whom

157
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:13,387
the

158
00:01:13,387 --> 00:01:13,545
Lord hath

159
00:01:13,545 --> 00:01:13,703
given

160
00:01:13,703 --> 00:01:13,861
me are

161
00:01:13,861 --> 00:01:14,019
for

162
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:14,177
signs and

163
00:01:14,177 --> 00:01:14,335
for

164
00:01:14,335 --> 00:01:14,493
wonders in

165
00:01:14,493 --> 00:01:14,651
Israel

166
00:01:14,651 --> 00:01:14,809
from

167
00:01:14,809 --> 00:01:14,967
the Lord

168
00:01:14,967 --> 00:01:15,125
of

169
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:15,283
Hosts,

170
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:15,909
which dwelleth in Mount Zion.

171
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:16,552
19 And

172
00:01:16,552 --> 00:01:17,195

173
00:01:17,195 --> 00:01:17,838
they

174
00:01:17,838 --> 00:01:18,481
shall

175
00:01:18,481 --> 00:01:19,124
say

176
00:01:19,124 --> 00:01:19,767
unto you:

177
00:01:19,767 --> 00:01:20,41
Seek

178
00:01:20,41 --> 00:01:21,053

179
00:01:21,053 --> 00:01:21,696
them

180
00:01:21,696 --> 00:01:22,339
that

181
00:01:22,339 --> 00:01:22,982
have

182
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:23,625
familiar

183
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:24,268


184
00:01:24,268 --> 00:01:24,911
spirits, and

185
00:01:24,911 --> 00:01:25,554
unto

186
00:01:25,554 --> 00:01:26,197

187
00:01:26,197 --> 00:01:26,84

191
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:29,412
mutter—should

192
00:01:29,412 --> 00:01:30,055
not a

193
00:01:30,055 --> 00:01:30,698

00:01:33,27 --> 00:01:33,76
the living to hear from the dead?

199
00:01:33,76 --> 00:01:34,141
20 To

200
00:01:34,141 --> 00:01:34,522

00:01:34,522 --> 00:01:34,903
law

202
00:01:34,903 --> 00:01:35,284
and to

testimony;

206
00:01:36,427 --> 00:01:36,808
and

207
