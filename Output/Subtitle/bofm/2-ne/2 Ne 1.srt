00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:17,875
The Second Book of NephiAn account of the death of

2
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:35,75
 Lehi. Nephi’s brethren rebel against him. The

3
00:00:35,75 --> 00:00:53,625
 Lord warns Nephi to depart into the wilderness. His

4
00:00:53,625 --> 00:01:11,5
 journeyings in the wilderness, and so forth.Chapter

5
00:01:11,5 --> 00:01:29,375
 1 Lehi prophesies of a land of liberty—His seed

6
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:47,25
 will be scattered and smitten if they reject the

7
00:01:47,25 --> 00:02:05,125
 Holy One of Israel—He exhorts his sons to put on the

8
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:23,0
 armor of righteousness. About 588–570 B.C.

9
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:27,543
1 And now it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had

10
00:02:27,543 --> 00:02:31,543
 made an end of teaching my brethren, our father,

11
00:02:31,543 --> 00:02:35,543
 Lehi, also spake many things unto them, and

12
00:02:35,543 --> 00:02:39,543
 rehearsed unto them, how great things the Lord had done

13
00:02:39,543 --> 00:02:43,543
 for them in bringing them out of the land of

14
00:02:43,543 --> 00:02:47,543
 Jerusalem

15
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,467
2 And he spake unto them concerning their

16
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:51,467
 rebellions upon the waters, and the mercies of God in

17
00:02:51,467 --> 00:02:53,467
 sparing their lives, that they were not swallowed up

18
00:02:53,467 --> 00:02:55,467
 in the sea

19
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:55,692
3 And he also spake unto them concerning the land

20
00:02:55,692 --> 00:02:55,942
 of promise, which they had obtained—how merciful

21
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:56,192
 the Lord had been in warning us that we should flee

22
00:02:56,192 --> 00:02:56,442
 out of the land of Jerusalem

23
00:02:56,643 --> 00:03:06,643
4 For, behold, said he, I have seen a vision, in

24
00:03:06,643 --> 00:03:16,643
 which I know that Jerusalem is destroyed; and had

25
00:03:16,643 --> 00:03:26,643
 we remained in Jerusalem we should also have

26
00:03:26,643 --> 00:03:36,643
 perished

27
00:03:36,75 --> 00:03:40,5
5 But, said he, notwithstanding our afflictions,

28
00:03:40,5 --> 00:03:44,25
 we have obtained a land of promise, a land which is

29
00:03:44,25 --> 00:03:47,0
 choice above all other lands; a land which the

30
00:03:47,0 --> 00:03:51,75
 Lord God hath covenanted with me should be a land

31
00:03:51,75 --> 00:03:55,5
 for the inheritance of my seed. Yea, the Lord hath

32
00:03:55,5 --> 00:03:59,25
 covenanted this land unto me, and to my children

33
00:03:59,25 --> 00:04:02,0
 forever, and also all those who should be led out of

34
00:04:02,0 --> 00:04:06,75
 other countries by the hand of the Lord

35
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:13,296
6 Wherefore, I, Lehi, prophesy according to the

36
00:04:13,296 --> 00:04:20,046
 workings of the Spirit which is in me, that there

37
00:04:20,046 --> 00:04:26,796
 shall none come into this land save they shall be

38
00:04:26,796 --> 00:04:33,546
 brought by the hand of the Lord

39
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:40,428
7 Wherefore, this land is consecrated unto him

40
00:04:40,428 --> 00:04:47,65
 whom he shall bring. And if it so be that they shall

41
00:04:47,65 --> 00:04:54,872
 serve him according to the commandments which he

42
00:04:54,872 --> 00:05:02,094
 hath given, it shall be a land of liberty unto

43
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:09,316
 them; wherefore, they shall never be brought down into

44
00:05:09,316 --> 00:05:16,538
 captivity; if so, it shall be because of

45
00:05:16,538 --> 00:05:23,76
 iniquity; for if iniquity shall abound cursed shall be the

46
00:05:23,76 --> 00:05:30,982
 land for their sakes, but unto the righteous it

47
00:05:30,982 --> 00:05:38,204
 shall be blessed forever

48
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:45,738
8 And behold, it is wisdom that this land should

49
00:05:45,738 --> 00:05:53,238
 be kept as yet from the knowledge of other nations;

50
00:05:53,238 --> 00:06:00,738
 for behold, many nations would overrun the land,

51
00:06:00,738 --> 00:06:08,238
 that there would be no place for an inheritance

52
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:37,67
9 Wherefore, I, Lehi, have obtained a promise,

53
00:06:37,67 --> 00:07:07,306
 that inasmuch as those whom the Lord God shall bring

54
00:07:07,306 --> 00:07:36,942
 out of the land of Jerusalem shall keep his

55
00:07:36,942 --> 00:08:06,578
 commandments, they shall prosper upon the face of this

56
00:08:06,578 --> 00:08:36,214
 land; and they shall be kept from all other

57
00:08:36,214 --> 00:09:05,85
 nations, that they may possess this land unto themselves.

58
00:09:05,85 --> 00:09:35,486
 And if it so be that they shall keep his

59
00:09:35,486 --> 00:10:05,122
 commandments they shall be blessed upon the face of this

60
00:10:05,122 --> 00:10:34,758
 land, and there shall be none to molest them, nor

61
00:10:34,758 --> 00:11:04,394
 to take away the land of their inheritance; and

62
00:11:04,394 --> 00:11:34,03
 they shall dwell safely forever

63
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:37,28
10 But behold, when the time cometh that they

64
00:11:37,28 --> 00:11:39,566
 shall dwindle in unbelief, after they have received so

65
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:41,852
 great blessings from the hand of the Lord—having

66
00:11:41,852 --> 00:11:44,138
 a knowledge of the creation of the earth, and all

67
00:11:44,138 --> 00:11:46,424
 men, knowing the great and marvelous works of the

68
00:11:46,424 --> 00:11:48,71
 Lord from the creation of the world; having power

69
00:11:48,71 --> 00:11:50,996
 given them to do all things by faith; having all

70
00:11:50,996 --> 00:11:53,282
 the commandments from the beginning, and having

71
00:11:53,282 --> 00:11:55,568
 been brought by his infinite goodness into this

72
00:11:55,568 --> 00:11:57,854
 precious land of promise—behold, I say, if the day

73
00:11:57,854 --> 00:12:00,14
 shall come that they will reject the Holy One of

74
00:12:00,14 --> 00:12:02,426
 Israel, the true Messiah, their Redeemer and their God,

75
00:12:02,426 --> 00:12:04,712
 behold, the judgments of him that is just shall

76
00:12:04,712 --> 00:12:06,998
 rest upon them

77
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:22,893
11 Yea, he will bring other nations unto them, and

78
00:12:22,893 --> 00:12:38,893
 he will give unto them power, and he will take

79
00:12:38,893 --> 00:12:54,893
 away from them the lands of their possessions, and

80
00:12:54,893 --> 00:13:10,893
 he will cause them to be scattered and smitten

81
00:13:10,69 --> 00:13:28,29
12 Yea, as one generation passeth to another there

82
00:13:28,29 --> 00:13:45,89
 shall be bloodsheds, and great visitations among

83
00:13:45,89 --> 00:14:03,49
 them; wherefore, my sons, I would that ye would

84
00:14:03,49 --> 00:14:21,09
 remember; yea, I would that ye would hearken unto my

85
00:14:21,09 --> 00:14:38,69
 words

86
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:46,411
13 O that ye would awake; awake from a deep sleep,

87
00:14:46,411 --> 00:14:54,411
 yea, even from the sleep of hell, and shake off

88
00:14:54,411 --> 00:15:02,411
 the awful chains by which ye are bound, which are

89
00:15:02,411 --> 00:15:10,411
 the chains which bind the children of men, that

90
00:15:10,411 --> 00:15:18,411
 they are carried away captive down to the eternal

91
00:15:18,411 --> 00:15:26,411
 gulf of misery and woe

92
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,859
14 Awake! and arise from the dust, and hear the

93
00:15:27,859 --> 00:15:29,459
 words of a trembling parent, whose limbs ye must

94
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:31,059
 soon lay down in the cold and silent grave, from

95
00:15:31,059 --> 00:15:32,659
 whence no traveler can return; a few more days and I

96
00:15:32,659 --> 00:15:34,259
 go the way of all the earth

97
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:42,233
15 But behold, the Lord hath redeemed my soul from

98
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:50,233
 hell; I have beheld his glory, and I am encircled

99
00:15:50,233 --> 00:15:58,233
 about eternally in the arms of his love

100
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:00,157
16 And I desire that ye should remember to observe

101
00:16:00,157 --> 00:16:02,157
 the statutes and the judgments of the Lord;

102
00:16:02,157 --> 00:16:04,157
 behold, this hath been the anxiety of my soul from the

103
00:16:04,157 --> 00:16:06,157
 beginning

104
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,732
17 My heart hath been weighed down with sorrow

105
00:16:07,732 --> 00:16:09,332
 from time to time, for I have feared, lest for the

106
00:16:09,332 --> 00:16:10,932
 hardness of your hearts the Lord your God should

107
00:16:10,932 --> 00:16:12,532
 come out in the fulness of his wrath upon you, that

108
00:16:12,532 --> 00:16:14,132
 ye be cut off and destroyed forever

109
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:18,106
18 Or, that a cursing should come upon you for the

110
00:16:18,106 --> 00:16:22,106
 space of many generations; and ye are visited by

111
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:26,106
 sword, and by famine, and are hated, and are led

112
00:16:26,106 --> 00:16:30,106
 according to the will and captivity of the devil

113
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:34,056
19 O my sons, that these things might not come

114
00:16:34,056 --> 00:16:38,056
 upon you, but that ye might be a choice and a favored

115
00:16:38,056 --> 00:16:42,056
 people of the Lord. But behold, his will be done;

116
00:16:42,056 --> 00:16:46,056
 for his ways are righteousness forever

117
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,755
20 And he hath said that: Inasmuch as ye shall

118
00:16:47,755 --> 00:16:49,505
 keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the land;

119
00:16:49,505 --> 00:16:51,255
 but inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye

120
00:16:51,255 --> 00:16:53,005
 shall be cut off from my presence

121
00:16:53,98 --> 00:16:55,123
21 And now that my soul might have joy in you, and

122
00:16:55,123 --> 00:16:56,266
 that my heart might leave this world with

123
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:57,409
 gladness because of you, that I might not be brought down

124
00:16:57,409 --> 00:16:58,552
 with grief and sorrow to the grave, arise from

125
00:16:58,552 --> 00:16:59,695
 the dust, my sons, and be men, and be determined in

126
00:16:59,695 --> 00:17:00,838
 one mind and in one heart, united in all things,

127
00:17:00,838 --> 00:17:01,981
 that ye may not come down into captivity

128
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,954
22 That ye may not be cursed with a sore cursing;

129
00:17:03,954 --> 00:17:05,954
 and also, that ye may not incur the displeasure of

130
00:17:05,954 --> 00:17:07,954
 a just God upon you, unto the destruction, yea,

131
00:17:07,954 --> 00:17:09,954
 the eternal destruction of both soul and body

132
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:10,179
23 Awake, my sons; put on the armor of

133
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:10,429
 righteousness. Shake off the chains with which ye are bound,

134
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:10,679
 and come forth out of obscurity, and arise from

135
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:10,929
 the dust

136
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:14,296
24 Rebel no more against your brother, whose views

137
00:17:14,296 --> 00:17:17,629
 have been glorious, and who hath kept the

138
00:17:17,629 --> 00:17:20,962
 commandments from the time that we left Jerusalem; and

139
00:17:20,962 --> 00:17:24,295
 who hath been an instrument in the hands of God, in

140
00:17:24,295 --> 00:17:27,628
 bringing us forth into the land of promise; for

141
00:17:27,628 --> 00:17:30,961
 were it not for him, we must have perished with

142
00:17:30,961 --> 00:17:34,294
 hunger in the wilderness; nevertheless, ye sought to

143
00:17:34,294 --> 00:17:37,627
 take away his life; yea, and he hath suffered much

144
00:17:37,627 --> 00:17:40,96
 sorrow because of you

145
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:48,393
25 And I exceedingly fear and tremble because of

146
00:17:48,393 --> 00:17:56,06
 you, lest he shall suffer again; for behold, ye

147
00:17:56,06 --> 00:18:03,727
 have accused him that he sought power and authority

148
00:18:03,727 --> 00:18:11,394
 over you; but I know that he hath not sought for

149
00:18:11,394 --> 00:18:19,061
 power nor authority over you, but he hath sought the

150
00:18:19,061 --> 00:18:26,728
 glory of God, and your own eternal welfare

151
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:32,997
26 And ye have murmured because he hath been plain

152
00:18:32,997 --> 00:18:39,622
 unto you. Ye say that he hath used sharpness; ye

153
00:18:39,622 --> 00:18:46,247
 say that he hath been angry with you; but behold,

154
00:18:46,247 --> 00:18:52,872
 his sharpness was the sharpness of the power of

155
00:18:52,872 --> 00:18:59,497
 the word of God, which was in him; and that which ye

156
00:18:59,497 --> 00:19:06,122
 call anger was the truth, according to that which

157
00:19:06,122 --> 00:19:12,747
 is in God, which he could not restrain,

158
00:19:12,747 --> 00:19:19,372
 manifesting boldly concerning your iniquities

159
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:25,691
27 And it must needs be that the power of God must

160
00:19:25,691 --> 00:19:32,024
 be with him, even unto his commanding you that ye

161
00:19:32,024 --> 00:19:38,357
 must obey. But behold, it was not he, but it was

162
00:19:38,357 --> 00:19:44,69
 the Spirit of the Lord which was in him, which

163
00:19:44,69 --> 00:19:51,023
 opened his mouth to utterance that he could not shut

164
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:57,356
 it

165
00:19:57,263 --> 00:20:15,763
28 And now my son, Laman, and also Lemuel and Sam,

166
00:20:15,763 --> 00:20:34,263
 and also my sons who are the sons of Ishmael,

167
00:20:34,263 --> 00:20:52,763
 behold, if ye will hearken unto the voice of Nephi ye

168
00:20:52,763 --> 00:21:11,263
 shall not perish. And if ye will hearken unto him

169
00:21:11,263 --> 00:21:29,763
 I leave unto you a blessing, yea, even my first

170
00:21:29,763 --> 00:21:48,263
 blessing

171
00:21:48,908 --> 00:22:02,241
29 But if ye will not hearken unto him I take away

172
00:22:02,241 --> 00:22:15,574
 my first blessing, yea, even my blessing, and it

173
00:22:15,574 --> 00:22:28,907
 shall rest upon him

174
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:30,381
30 And now, Zoram, I speak unto you: Behold, thou

175
00:22:30,381 --> 00:22:31,981
 art the servant of Laban; nevertheless, thou hast

176
00:22:31,981 --> 00:22:33,581
 been brought out of the land of Jerusalem, and I

177
