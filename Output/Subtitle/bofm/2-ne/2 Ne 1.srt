1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
The Second Book of NephiAn account of the death

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of Lehi. Nephi’s brethren rebel against him. The

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Lord warns Nephi to depart into the wilderness.

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
His journeyings in the wilderness, and so

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
forth.Chapter 1 Lehi prophesies of a land of liberty—His

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
seed will be scattered and smitten if they reject

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Holy One of Israel—He exhorts his sons to put

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:04:57,
on the armor of righteousness. About 588–570 B.C. 

9
00:04:57,0 --> 00:04:57,0
1 And now it came to pass that after I,

10
00:04:57,0 --> 00:04:57,0
Nephi, had made an end of teaching my

11
00:04:57,0 --> 00:04:57,0
brethren, our father, Lehi, also spake many

12
00:04:57,0 --> 00:04:57,0
things unto them, and rehearsed unto them, how

13
00:04:57,0 --> 00:04:57,0
great things the Lord had done for them

14
00:04:57,0 --> 00:06:41,
in bringing them out of the land of Jerusalem.

15
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
2 And he spake unto them concerning

16
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
their rebellions upon the waters, and the

17
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
mercies of God in sparing their lives,

18
00:06:41,0 --> 00:14:11,
that they were not swallowed up in the sea.

19
00:14:11,0 --> 00:14:11,0
3 And he also spake unto them

20
00:14:11,0 --> 00:14:11,0
concerning the land of promise, which they

21
00:14:11,0 --> 00:14:11,0
had obtained—how merciful the Lord

22
00:14:11,0 --> 00:14:11,0
had been in warning us that we

23
00:14:11,0 --> 00:17:42,
should flee out of the land of Jerusalem.

24
00:17:42,0 --> 00:17:42,0
4 For, behold, said he, I have

25
00:17:42,0 --> 00:17:42,0
seen a vision, in which I

26
00:17:42,0 --> 00:17:42,0
know that Jerusalem is destroyed;

27
00:17:42,0 --> 00:17:42,0
and had we remained in

28
00:17:42,0 --> 00:20:38,
Jerusalem we should also have perished.

29
00:20:38,0 --> 00:20:38,0
5 But, said he,

30
00:20:38,0 --> 00:20:38,0
notwithstanding our afflictions, we

31
00:20:38,0 --> 00:20:38,0
have obtained a land of

32
00:20:38,0 --> 00:20:38,0
promise, a land which is choice

33
00:20:38,0 --> 00:20:38,0
above all other lands; a

34
00:20:38,0 --> 00:20:38,0
land which the Lord God hath

35
00:20:38,0 --> 00:20:38,0
covenanted with me should

36
00:20:38,0 --> 00:20:38,0
be a land for the

37
00:20:38,0 --> 00:20:38,0
inheritance of my seed. Yea, the Lord

38
00:20:38,0 --> 00:20:38,0
hath covenanted this land

39
00:20:38,0 --> 00:20:38,0
unto me, and to my children

40
00:20:38,0 --> 00:20:38,0
forever, and also all

41
00:20:38,0 --> 00:20:38,0
those who should be led out of

42
00:20:38,0 --> 00:29:47,
other countries by the hand of the Lord.

43
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
6 Wherefore, I, Lehi,

44
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
prophesy according to the

45
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
workings of the Spirit

46
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
which is in me, that there

47
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
shall none come into this

48
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
land save they shall be

49
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,
brought by the hand of the Lord.

50
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
7 Wherefore, this land

51
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
is consecrated unto him

52
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
whom he shall bring. And

53
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
if it so be that they

54
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
shall serve him according

55
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
to the commandments

56
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
which he hath given, it

57
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
shall be a land of liberty

58
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
unto them; wherefore,

59
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
they shall never be brought

60
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
down into captivity; if

61
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
so, it shall be because

62
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
of iniquity; for if

63
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
iniquity shall abound

64
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
cursed shall be the land for

65
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
their sakes, but unto

66
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,
the righteous it shall be blessed forever.

67
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
8 And behold, it is

68
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
wisdom that this land

69
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
should be kept as yet

70
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
from the knowledge of

71
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
other nations; for

72
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
behold, many nations would

73
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
overrun the land, that

74
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
there would be no

75
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,
place for an inheritance.

76
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
9 Wherefore, I, Lehi,

77
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
have obtained a

78
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
promise, that inasmuch as

79
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
those whom the Lord

80
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
God shall bring out

81
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
of the land of

82
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
Jerusalem shall keep his

83
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
commandments, they shall

84
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
prosper upon the

85
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
face of this land; and

86
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
they shall be kept

87
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
from all other nations,

88
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
that they may possess

89
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
this land unto

90
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
themselves. And if it so

91
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
be that they shall

92
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
keep his commandments

93
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
they shall be blessed

94
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
upon the face of this

95
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
land, and there shall

96
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
be none to molest

97
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
them, nor to take away

98
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
the land of their

99
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
inheritance; and they

100
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,
shall dwell safely forever.

101
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
10 But behold, when

102
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
the time cometh that

103
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
they shall dwindle

104
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
in unbelief, after

105
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
they have received so

106
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
great blessings

107
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
from the hand of the

108
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
Lord—having a

109
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
knowledge of the creation of

110
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
the earth, and all

111
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
men, knowing the

112
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
great and marvelous

113
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
works of the Lord from

114
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
the creation of the

115
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
world; having power

116
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
given them to do all

117
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
things by faith;

118
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
having all the

119
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
commandments from the

120
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
beginning, and having

121
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
been brought by his

122
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
infinite goodness into

123
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
this precious land

124
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
of promise—behold, I

125
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
say, if the day

126
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
shall come that they

127
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
will reject the Holy

128
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
One of Israel, the

129
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
true Messiah, their

130
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
Redeemer and their God,

131
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
behold, the

132
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,
judgments of him that is just shall rest upon them.

133
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
11 Yea, he will

134
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
bring other nations

135
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
unto them, and he

136
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
will give unto them

137
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
power, and he will

138
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
take away from them

139
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
the lands of their

140
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
possessions, and he

141
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
will cause them to

142
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,
be scattered and smitten.

143
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
12 Yea, as one

144
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
generation passeth to

145
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
another there

146
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
shall be bloodsheds,

147
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
and great

148
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
visitations among them;

149
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
wherefore, my sons,

150
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
I would that ye

151
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
would remember; yea,

152
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
I would that ye

153
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,
would hearken unto my words.

154
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
13 O that ye would

155
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
awake; awake from

156
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
a deep sleep,

157
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
yea, even from the

158
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
sleep of hell, and

159
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
shake off the awful

160
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
chains by which

161
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
ye are bound, which

162
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
are the chains

163
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
which bind the

164
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
children of men, that

165
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
they are carried

166
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
away captive down to

167
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
the eternal gulf

168
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,
of misery and woe.

169
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
14 Awake! and

170
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
arise from the dust,

171
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
and hear the

172
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
words of a trembling

173
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
parent, whose

174
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
limbs ye must soon

175
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
lay down in the

176
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
cold and silent

177
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
grave, from whence

178
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
no traveler can

179
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
return; a few more

180
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
days and I go

181
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,
the way of all the earth.

182
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
15 But behold,

183
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
the Lord hath

184
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
redeemed my soul

185
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
from hell; I

186
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
have beheld his

187
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
glory, and I am

188
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
encircled

189
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
about eternally in

190
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,
the arms of his love.

191
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
16 And I

192
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
desire that ye

193
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
should remember to

194
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
observe the

195
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
statutes and

196
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
the judgments of

197
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
the Lord;

198
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
behold, this hath

199
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
been the

200
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
anxiety of my soul

201
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,
from the beginning.

202
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
17 My heart

203
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
hath been

204
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
weighed down with

205
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
sorrow from

206
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
time to time,

207
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
for I have

208
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
feared, lest

209
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
for the

210
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
hardness of your

211
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
hearts the Lord

212
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
your God

213
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
should come out

214
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
in the

215
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
fulness of his

216
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
wrath upon you,

217
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
that ye be cut

218
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,
off and destroyed forever;

219
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
18 Or, that

220
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
a cursing

221
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
should come

222
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
upon you for

223
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
the space of

224
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
many

225
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
generations; and ye

226
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
are visited

227
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
by sword,

228
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
and by

229
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
famine, and are

230
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
hated, and are

231
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
led

232
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
according to the

233
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
will and

234
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,
captivity of the devil.

235
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
19 O my

236
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
sons, that

237
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
these things

238
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
might not

239
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
come upon

240
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
you, but that

241
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
ye might be

242
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
a choice

243
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
and a

244
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
favored people of

245
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
the Lord.

246
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
But behold,

247
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
his will

248
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
be done; for

249
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
his ways

250
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,
are righteousness forever.

251
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
20 And he

252
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
hath said

253
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
that:

254
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
Inasmuch as ye

255
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
shall

256
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
keep my

257
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
commandments ye

258
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
shall

259
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
prosper in

260
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
the land;

261
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
but inasmuch

262
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
as ye

263
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
will not keep

264
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
my

265
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
commandments ye

266
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
shall be

267
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,
cut off from my presence.

268
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
21 And now

269
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
that my

270
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
soul might

271
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
have joy

272
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
in you, and

273
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
that my

274
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
heart might

275
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
leave

276
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
this world

277
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
with

278
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
gladness because

279
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
of you,

280
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
that I might

281
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
not be

282
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
brought down

283
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
with

284
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
grief and

285
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
sorrow to the

286
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0

288
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
the dust, my

289
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
sons, and

290
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0

291
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0

292
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0

293
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
one mind

294
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
and in one

295
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
heart,

296
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
united in all

297
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
things,

298
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
that ye may

299
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
not come

300
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
down into

301
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,
captivity;

302
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
22 That

303
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0

00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
be

305
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
cursed with a

306
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
sore

307
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
cursing; and

308
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
also,

309
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
that ye may

310
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
not incur

311
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
the

312
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
displeasure

313
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
of a just

00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
you, unto

00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
the

317
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
destruction,

318
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
yea, the

319
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
eternal

320
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0


321
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,
destruction of both soul and body.

322
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
23

323
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
Awake, my

324
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0

armor of

327
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0


328
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
righteousness.

329
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
Shake off

330
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
the

331
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
chains with

00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
him, we

379
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
must

380
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
have

381
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
perished

382
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
with

383
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
hunger in

384
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
the

385
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
wilderness;

386
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0


387
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
nevertheless,

388
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
ye

389
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
sought to

390
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
take

391
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
away his

392
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,
life; yea, and he hath suffered much sorrow because of you.

393
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
25 And

394
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
I

395
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
exceedingly

396
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
fear

00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
and

398
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
tremble

399
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
because of

400
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
you,

401
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
lest he

402
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
shall

403
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
suffer

404
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
again;

405
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
for

406
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0

407
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
have

408
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
accused

409
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
him that

410
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
he

411
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
sought

412
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
power and

413
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0


414
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
authority over

415
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
you;

416
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
but I

417
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
know that

418
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
he hath

419
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
not

420
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
sought

421
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
for power

422
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
nor

423
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
authority

424
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
over

425
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
you, but

426
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
he

427
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
hath

428
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
sought the

429
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
glory of

430
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
God,

431
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
and your

432
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0

433
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0

00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,
welfare.

435
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
26 And

436
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
ye

437
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
have

438
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
murmured

439
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0


440
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
because he

441
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
hath

442
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
been

443
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
plain

444
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
unto you.

445
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
Ye

446
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
say that

447
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
he

448
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
hath

449
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
used

450
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
sharpness;

And it
