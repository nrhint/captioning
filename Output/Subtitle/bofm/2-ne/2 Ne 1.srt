00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:02,625
The Second Book of NephiAn account of the death

2
00:00:02,625 --> 00:00:05,25
of Lehi. Nephi’s brethren rebel against him. The

3
00:00:05,25 --> 00:00:07,875
Lord warns Nephi to depart into the wilderness.

4
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:10,5
His journeyings in the wilderness, and so

5
00:00:10,5 --> 00:00:13,125
forth.Chapter 1 Lehi prophesies of a land of liberty—His

6
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:15,75
seed will be scattered and smitten if they reject

7
00:00:15,75 --> 00:00:18,375
the Holy One of Israel—He exhorts his sons to put

8
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:21,788
on the armor of righteousness. About 588–570 B.C. 

9
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:22,955
1 And now it came to pass that after I,

10
00:00:22,955 --> 00:00:24,122
Nephi, had made an end of teaching my

11
00:00:24,122 --> 00:00:25,289
brethren, our father, Lehi, also spake many

12
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:26,456
things unto them, and rehearsed unto them, how

13
00:00:26,456 --> 00:00:27,623
great things the Lord had done for them

14
00:00:27,623 --> 00:00:28,829
in bringing them out of the land of Jerusalem.

15
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:29,579
2 And he spake unto them concerning

16
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:30,329
their rebellions upon the waters, and the

17
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:31,079
mercies of God in sparing their lives,

18
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:31,231
that they were not swallowed up in the sea.

19
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:37,231
3 And he also spake unto them

20
00:00:37,231 --> 00:00:43,231
concerning the land of promise, which they

21
00:00:43,231 --> 00:00:49,231
had obtained—how merciful the Lord

22
00:00:49,231 --> 00:00:55,231
had been in warning us that we

23
00:00:55,231 --> 00:01:01,461
should flee out of the land of Jerusalem.

24
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:03,461
4 For, behold, said he, I have

25
00:01:03,461 --> 00:01:05,461
seen a vision, in which I

26
00:01:05,461 --> 00:01:07,461
know that Jerusalem is destroyed;

27
00:01:07,461 --> 00:01:09,461
and had we remained in

28
00:01:09,461 --> 00:01:11,838
Jerusalem we should also have perished.

29
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:11,767
5 But, said he,

30
00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:11,696
notwithstanding our afflictions, we

31
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:11,625
have obtained a land of

32
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:11,554
promise, a land which is choice

33
00:01:11,554 --> 00:01:11,483
above all other lands; a

34
00:01:11,483 --> 00:01:11,412
land which the Lord God hath

35
00:01:11,412 --> 00:01:11,341
covenanted with me should

36
00:01:11,341 --> 00:01:11,27
be a land for the

37
00:01:11,27 --> 00:01:11,199
inheritance of my seed. Yea, the Lord

38
00:01:11,199 --> 00:01:11,128
hath covenanted this land

39
00:01:11,128 --> 00:01:11,057
unto me, and to my children

40
00:01:11,057 --> 00:01:10,986
forever, and also all

41
00:01:10,986 --> 00:01:10,915
those who should be led out of

42
00:01:10,915 --> 00:01:10,904
other countries by the hand of the Lord.

43
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:10,761
6 Wherefore, I, Lehi,

44
00:01:10,761 --> 00:01:10,618
prophesy according to the

45
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:10,475
workings of the Spirit

46
00:01:10,475 --> 00:01:10,332
which is in me, that there

47
00:01:10,332 --> 00:01:10,189
shall none come into this

48
00:01:10,189 --> 00:01:10,046
land save they shall be

49
00:01:10,046 --> 00:01:09,97
brought by the hand of the Lord.

50
00:01:09,97 --> 00:01:10,146
7 Wherefore, this land

51
00:01:10,146 --> 00:01:10,322
is consecrated unto him

52
00:01:10,322 --> 00:01:10,498
whom he shall bring. And

53
00:01:10,498 --> 00:01:10,674
if it so be that they

54
00:01:10,674 --> 00:01:10,85
shall serve him according

55
00:01:10,85 --> 00:01:11,026
to the commandments

56
00:01:11,026 --> 00:01:11,202
which he hath given, it

57
00:01:11,202 --> 00:01:11,378
shall be a land of liberty

58
00:01:11,378 --> 00:01:11,554
unto them; wherefore,

59
00:01:11,554 --> 00:01:11,73
they shall never be brought

60
00:01:11,73 --> 00:01:11,906
down into captivity; if

61
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:12,082
so, it shall be because

62
00:01:12,082 --> 00:01:12,258
of iniquity; for if

63
00:01:12,258 --> 00:01:12,434
iniquity shall abound

64
00:01:12,434 --> 00:01:12,61
cursed shall be the land for

65
00:01:12,61 --> 00:01:12,786
their sakes, but unto

66
00:01:12,786 --> 00:01:12,372
the righteous it shall be blessed forever.

67
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:13,483
8 And behold, it is

68
00:01:13,483 --> 00:01:14,594
wisdom that this land

69
00:01:14,594 --> 00:01:15,705
should be kept as yet

70
00:01:15,705 --> 00:01:16,816
from the knowledge of

71
00:01:16,816 --> 00:01:17,927
other nations; for

72
00:01:17,927 --> 00:01:19,038
behold, many nations would

73
00:01:19,038 --> 00:01:20,149
overrun the land, that

74
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:21,26
there would be no

75
00:01:21,26 --> 00:01:22,249
place for an inheritance.

76
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:22,569
9 Wherefore, I, Lehi,

77
00:01:22,569 --> 00:01:22,889
have obtained a

78
00:01:22,889 --> 00:01:23,209
promise, that inasmuch as

79
00:01:23,209 --> 00:01:23,529
those whom the Lord

80
00:01:23,529 --> 00:01:23,849
God shall bring out

81
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:24,169
of the land of

82
00:01:24,169 --> 00:01:24,489
Jerusalem shall keep his

83
00:01:24,489 --> 00:01:24,809
commandments, they shall

84
00:01:24,809 --> 00:01:25,129
prosper upon the

85
00:01:25,129 --> 00:01:25,449
face of this land; and

86
00:01:25,449 --> 00:01:25,769
they shall be kept

87
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:26,089
from all other nations,

88
00:01:26,089 --> 00:01:26,409
that they may possess

89
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:26,729
this land unto

90
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:27,049
themselves. And if it so

91
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:27,369
be that they shall

92
00:01:27,369 --> 00:01:27,689
keep his commandments

93
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:28,009
they shall be blessed

94
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:28,329
upon the face of this

95
00:01:28,329 --> 00:01:28,649
land, and there shall

96
00:01:28,649 --> 00:01:28,969
be none to molest

97
00:01:28,969 --> 00:01:29,289
them, nor to take away

98
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:29,609
the land of their

99
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:29,929
inheritance; and they

100
00:01:29,929 --> 00:01:30,223
shall dwell safely forever.

101
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:30,911
10 But behold, when

102
00:01:30,911 --> 00:01:31,599
the time cometh that

103
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:32,287
they shall dwindle

104
00:01:32,287 --> 00:01:32,975
in unbelief, after

105
00:01:32,975 --> 00:01:33,663
they have received so

106
00:01:33,663 --> 00:01:34,351
great blessings

107
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:35,039
from the hand of the

108
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:35,727
Lord—having a

109
00:01:35,727 --> 00:01:36,415
knowledge of the creation of

110
00:01:36,415 --> 00:01:37,103
the earth, and all

111
00:01:37,103 --> 00:01:37,791
men, knowing the

112
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:38,479
great and marvelous

113
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,167
works of the Lord from

114
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:39,855
the creation of the

115
00:01:39,855 --> 00:01:40,543
world; having power

116
00:01:40,543 --> 00:01:41,231
given them to do all

117
00:01:41,231 --> 00:01:41,919
things by faith;

118
00:01:41,919 --> 00:01:42,607
having all the

119
00:01:42,607 --> 00:01:43,295
commandments from the

120
00:01:43,295 --> 00:01:43,983
beginning, and having

121
00:01:43,983 --> 00:01:44,671
been brought by his

122
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:45,359
infinite goodness into

123
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:46,047
this precious land

124
00:01:46,047 --> 00:01:46,735
of promise—behold, I

125
00:01:46,735 --> 00:01:47,423
say, if the day

126
00:01:47,423 --> 00:01:48,111
shall come that they

127
00:01:48,111 --> 00:01:48,799
will reject the Holy

128
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:49,487
One of Israel, the

129
00:01:49,487 --> 00:01:50,175
true Messiah, their

130
00:01:50,175 --> 00:01:50,863
Redeemer and their God,

131
00:01:50,863 --> 00:01:51,551
behold, the

132
00:01:51,551 --> 00:01:52,012
judgments of him that is just shall rest upon them.

133
00:01:52,012 --> 00:01:52,912
11 Yea, he will

134
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:53,812
bring other nations

135
00:01:53,812 --> 00:01:54,712
unto them, and he

136
00:01:54,712 --> 00:01:55,612
will give unto them

137
00:01:55,612 --> 00:01:56,512
power, and he will

138
00:01:56,512 --> 00:01:57,412
take away from them

139
00:01:57,412 --> 00:01:58,312
the lands of their

140
00:01:58,312 --> 00:01:59,212
possessions, and he

141
00:01:59,212 --> 00:02:00,112
will cause them to

142
00:02:00,112 --> 00:02:01,922
be scattered and smitten.

143
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:03,013
12 Yea, as one

144
00:02:03,013 --> 00:02:04,104
generation passeth to

145
00:02:04,104 --> 00:02:05,195
another there

146
00:02:05,195 --> 00:02:06,286
shall be bloodsheds,

147
00:02:06,286 --> 00:02:07,377
and great

148
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,468
visitations among them;

149
00:02:08,468 --> 00:02:09,559
wherefore, my sons,

150
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:10,65
I would that ye

151
00:02:10,65 --> 00:02:11,741
would remember; yea,

152
00:02:11,741 --> 00:02:12,832
I would that ye

153
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:13,367
would hearken unto my words.

154
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:14,034
13 O that ye would

155
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:14,701
awake; awake from

156
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:15,368
a deep sleep,

157
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:16,035
yea, even from the

158
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:16,702
sleep of hell, and

159
00:02:16,702 --> 00:02:17,369
shake off the awful

160
00:02:17,369 --> 00:02:18,036
chains by which

161
00:02:18,036 --> 00:02:18,703
ye are bound, which

162
00:02:18,703 --> 00:02:19,37
are the chains

163
00:02:19,37 --> 00:02:20,037
which bind the

164
00:02:20,037 --> 00:02:20,704
children of men, that

165
00:02:20,704 --> 00:02:21,371
they are carried

166
00:02:21,371 --> 00:02:22,038
away captive down to

167
00:02:22,038 --> 00:02:22,705
the eternal gulf

168
00:02:22,705 --> 00:02:23,71
of misery and woe.

169
00:02:23,71 --> 00:02:24,941
14 Awake! and

170
00:02:24,941 --> 00:02:26,172
arise from the dust,

171
00:02:26,172 --> 00:02:27,403
and hear the

172
00:02:27,403 --> 00:02:28,634
words of a trembling

173
00:02:28,634 --> 00:02:29,865
parent, whose

174
00:02:29,865 --> 00:02:31,096
limbs ye must soon

175
00:02:31,096 --> 00:02:32,327
lay down in the

176
00:02:32,327 --> 00:02:33,558
cold and silent

177
00:02:33,558 --> 00:02:34,789
grave, from whence

178
00:02:34,789 --> 00:02:36,02
no traveler can

179
00:02:36,02 --> 00:02:37,251
return; a few more

180
00:02:37,251 --> 00:02:38,482
days and I go

181
00:02:38,482 --> 00:02:39,66
the way of all the earth.

182
00:02:39,66 --> 00:02:40,216
15 But behold,

183
00:02:40,216 --> 00:02:40,772
the Lord hath

184
00:02:40,772 --> 00:02:41,328
redeemed my soul

185
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:41,883
from hell; I

186
00:02:41,883 --> 00:02:42,44
have beheld his

187
00:02:42,44 --> 00:02:42,996
glory, and I am

188
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:43,552
encircled

189
00:02:43,552 --> 00:02:44,108
about eternally in

190
00:02:44,108 --> 00:02:44,064
the arms of his love.

191
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:45,064
16 And I

192
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:46,064
desire that ye

193
00:02:46,064 --> 00:02:47,064
should remember to

194
00:02:47,064 --> 00:02:48,064
observe the

195
00:02:48,064 --> 00:02:49,064
statutes and

196
00:02:49,064 --> 00:02:50,064
the judgments of

197
00:02:50,064 --> 00:02:51,064
the Lord;

198
00:02:51,064 --> 00:02:52,064
behold, this hath

199
00:02:52,064 --> 00:02:53,064
been the

200
00:02:53,064 --> 00:02:54,064
anxiety of my soul

201
00:02:54,064 --> 00:02:55,475
from the beginning.

202
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:55,651
17 My heart

203
00:02:55,651 --> 00:02:55,827
hath been

204
00:02:55,827 --> 00:02:56,003
weighed down with

205
00:02:56,003 --> 00:02:56,179
sorrow from

206
00:02:56,179 --> 00:02:56,355
time to time,

207
00:02:56,355 --> 00:02:56,531
for I have

208
00:02:56,531 --> 00:02:56,707
feared, lest

209
00:02:56,707 --> 00:02:56,883
for the

210
00:02:56,883 --> 00:02:57,059
hardness of your

211
00:02:57,059 --> 00:02:57,235
hearts the Lord

212
00:02:57,235 --> 00:02:57,411
your God

213
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:57,587
should come out

214
00:02:57,587 --> 00:02:57,763
in the

215
00:02:57,763 --> 00:02:57,939
fulness of his

216
00:02:57,939 --> 00:02:58,115
wrath upon you,

217
00:02:58,115 --> 00:02:58,291
that ye be cut

218
00:02:58,291 --> 00:02:58,945
off and destroyed forever;

219
00:02:58,945 --> 00:02:59,133
18 Or, that

220
00:02:59,133 --> 00:02:59,321
a cursing

221
00:02:59,321 --> 00:02:59,509
should come

222
00:02:59,509 --> 00:02:59,697
upon you for

223
00:02:59,697 --> 00:02:59,885
the space of

224
00:02:59,885 --> 00:03:00,073
many

225
00:03:00,073 --> 00:03:00,261
generations; and ye

226
00:03:00,261 --> 00:03:00,449
are visited

227
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:00,637
by sword,

228
00:03:00,637 --> 00:03:00,825
and by

229
00:03:00,825 --> 00:03:01,013
famine, and are

230
00:03:01,013 --> 00:03:01,201
hated, and are

231
00:03:01,201 --> 00:03:01,389
led

232
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:01,577
according to the

233
00:03:01,577 --> 00:03:01,765
will and

234
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:01,948
captivity of the devil.

235
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:02,198
19 O my

236
00:03:02,198 --> 00:03:02,448
sons, that

237
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:02,698
these things

238
00:03:02,698 --> 00:03:02,948
might not

239
00:03:02,948 --> 00:03:03,198
come upon

240
00:03:03,198 --> 00:03:03,448
you, but that

241
00:03:03,448 --> 00:03:03,698
ye might be

242
00:03:03,698 --> 00:03:03,948
a choice

243
00:03:03,948 --> 00:03:04,198
and a

244
00:03:04,198 --> 00:03:04,448
favored people of

245
00:03:04,448 --> 00:03:04,698
the Lord.

246
00:03:04,698 --> 00:03:04,948
But behold,

247
00:03:04,948 --> 00:03:05,198
his will

248
00:03:05,198 --> 00:03:05,448
be done; for

249
00:03:05,448 --> 00:03:05,698
his ways

250
00:03:05,698 --> 00:03:05,419
are righteousness forever.

251
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:06,184
20 And he

252
00:03:06,184 --> 00:03:06,949
hath said

253
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:07,714
that:

254
00:03:07,714 --> 00:03:08,479
Inasmuch as ye

255
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,244
shall

256
00:03:09,244 --> 00:03:10,009
keep my

257
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:10,774
commandments ye

258
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:11,539
shall

259
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:12,304
prosper in

260
00:03:12,304 --> 00:03:13,069
the land;

261
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:13,834
but inasmuch

262
00:03:13,834 --> 00:03:14,599
as ye

263
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:15,364
will not keep

264
00:03:15,364 --> 00:03:16,129
my

265
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:16,894
commandments ye

266
00:03:16,894 --> 00:03:17,659
shall be

267
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:18,765
cut off from my presence.

268
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:20,03
21 And now

269
00:03:20,03 --> 00:03:21,295
that my

270
00:03:21,295 --> 00:03:22,56
soul might

271
00:03:22,56 --> 00:03:23,825
have joy

272
00:03:23,825 --> 00:03:25,09
in you, and

273
00:03:25,09 --> 00:03:26,355
that my

274
00:03:26,355 --> 00:03:27,62
heart might

275
00:03:27,62 --> 00:03:28,885
leave

276
00:03:28,885 --> 00:03:30,15
this world

277
00:03:30,15 --> 00:03:31,415
with

278
00:03:31,415 --> 00:03:32,68
gladness because

279
00:03:32,68 --> 00:03:33,945
of you,

280
00:03:33,945 --> 00:03:35,21
that I might

281
00:03:35,21 --> 00:03:36,475
not be

282
00:03:36,475 --> 00:03:37,74
brought down

283
00:03:37,74 --> 00:03:39,005
with

284
00:03:39,005 --> 00:03:40,27
grief and

285
00:03:40,27 --> 00:03:41,535
sorrow to the

286
00:03:41,535 --> 00:03:42,8
grave,

287
00:03:42,8 --> 00:03:44,065
arise from

288
00:03:44,065 --> 00:03:45,33
the dust, my

289
00:03:45,33 --> 00:03:46,595
sons, and

290
00:03:46,595 --> 00:03:47,86
be men,

291
00:03:47,86 --> 00:03:49,125
and be

292
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:50,39
determined in

293
00:03:50,39 --> 00:03:51,655
one mind

294
00:03:51,655 --> 00:03:52,92
and in one

295
00:03:52,92 --> 00:03:54,185
heart,

296
00:03:54,185 --> 00:03:55,45
united in all

297
00:03:55,45 --> 00:03:56,715
things,

298
00:03:56,715 --> 00:03:57,98
that ye may

299
00:03:57,98 --> 00:03:59,245
not come

300
00:03:59,245 --> 00:04:00,51
down into

301
00:04:00,51 --> 00:04:01,041
captivity;

302
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:01,241
22 That

303
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:01,441
ye may not

304
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:01,641
be

305
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:01,841
cursed with a

306
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:02,041
sore

307
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:02,241
cursing; and

308
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:02,441
also,

309
00:04:02,441 --> 00:04:02,641
that ye may

310
00:04:02,641 --> 00:04:02,841
not incur

311
00:04:02,841 --> 00:04:03,041
the

312
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:03,241
displeasure

313
00:04:03,241 --> 00:04:03,441
of a just

314
00:04:03,441 --> 00:04:03,641
God upon

315
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:03,841
you, unto

316
00:04:03,841 --> 00:04:04,041
the

317
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:04,241
destruction,

318
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:04,441
yea, the

319
00:04:04,441 --> 00:04:04,641
eternal

320
00:04:04,641 --> 00:04:04,841


321
00:04:04,841 --> 00:04:05,445
destruction of both soul and body.

322
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:06,056
23

323
00:04:06,056 --> 00:04:06,667
Awake, my

324
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:07,278
sons; put

325
00:04:07,278 --> 00:04:07,889
on the

326
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:08,5
armor of

327
00:04:08,5 --> 00:04:09,111


328
00:04:09,111 --> 00:04:09,722
righteousness.

329
00:04:09,722 --> 00:04:10,333
Shake off

330
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:10,944
the

331
00:04:10,944 --> 00:04:11,555
chains with

332
00:04:11,555 --> 00:04:12,166
which ye

333
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:12,777
are

334
00:04:12,777 --> 00:04:13,388
bound, and

335
00:04:13,388 --> 00:04:13,999
come

336
00:04:13,999 --> 00:04:14,61
forth out

337
00:04:14,61 --> 00:04:15,221
of

338
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:15,832
obscurity, and

339
00:04:15,832 --> 00:04:16,389
arise from the dust.

340
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:16,521
24

341
00:04:16,521 --> 00:04:16,653
Rebel no

342
00:04:16,653 --> 00:04:16,785
more

343
00:04:16,785 --> 00:04:16,917
against

344
00:04:16,917 --> 00:04:17,049
your

345
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:17,181
brother,

346
00:04:17,181 --> 00:04:17,313
whose

347
00:04:17,313 --> 00:04:17,445
views have

348
00:04:17,445 --> 00:04:17,577
been

349
00:04:17,577 --> 00:04:17,709
glorious,

350
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:17,841
and

351
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:17,973
who hath

352
00:04:17,973 --> 00:04:18,105
kept

353
00:04:18,105 --> 00:04:18,237
the

354
00:04:18,237 --> 00:04:18,369
commandments

355
00:04:18,369 --> 00:04:18,501
from

356
00:04:18,501 --> 00:04:18,633
the time

357
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:18,765
that

358
00:04:18,765 --> 00:04:18,897
we left

359
00:04:18,897 --> 00:04:19,029


360
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:19,161
Jerusalem; and

361
00:04:19,161 --> 00:04:19,293
who

362
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:19,425
hath been

363
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:19,557
an

364
00:04:19,557 --> 00:04:19,689
instrument

365
00:04:19,689 --> 00:04:19,821
in the

366
00:04:19,821 --> 00:04:19,953
hands

367
00:04:19,953 --> 00:04:20,085
of God,

368
00:04:20,085 --> 00:04:20,217
in

369
00:04:20,217 --> 00:04:20,349
bringing

370
00:04:20,349 --> 00:04:20,481
us forth

371
00:04:20,481 --> 00:04:20,613
into

372
00:04:20,613 --> 00:04:20,745
the land

373
00:04:20,745 --> 00:04:20,877
of

374
00:04:20,877 --> 00:04:21,009
promise;

375
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:21,141
for were

376
00:04:21,141 --> 00:04:21,273
it not

377
00:04:21,273 --> 00:04:21,405
for

378
00:04:21,405 --> 00:04:21,537
him, we

379
00:04:21,537 --> 00:04:21,669
must

380
00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:21,801
have

381
00:04:21,801 --> 00:04:21,933
perished

382
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:22,065
with

383
00:04:22,065 --> 00:04:22,197
hunger in

384
00:04:22,197 --> 00:04:22,329
the

385
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:22,461
wilderness;

386
00:04:22,461 --> 00:04:22,593


387
00:04:22,593 --> 00:04:22,725
nevertheless,

388
00:04:22,725 --> 00:04:22,857
ye

389
00:04:22,857 --> 00:04:22,989
sought to

390
00:04:22,989 --> 00:04:23,121
take

391
00:04:23,121 --> 00:04:23,253
away his

392
00:04:23,253 --> 00:04:23,897
life; yea, and he hath suffered much sorrow because of you.

393
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:24,111
25 And

394
00:04:24,111 --> 00:04:24,325
I

395
00:04:24,325 --> 00:04:24,539
exceedingly

396
00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:24,753
fear

397
00:04:24,753 --> 00:04:24,967
and

398
00:04:24,967 --> 00:04:25,181
tremble

399
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:25,395
because of

400
00:04:25,395 --> 00:04:25,609
you,

401
00:04:25,609 --> 00:04:25,823
lest he

402
00:04:25,823 --> 00:04:26,037
shall

403
00:04:26,037 --> 00:04:26,251
suffer

404
00:04:26,251 --> 00:04:26,465
again;

405
00:04:26,465 --> 00:04:26,679

00:04:27,963 --> 00:04:28,177
power and

463
00:04:41,327 --> 00:04:41,648
the

464
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:41,969


465
00:04:41,969 --> 00:04:42,29

him;

474
00:04:44,858 --> 00:04:45,179
and

475
00:04:45,179 --> 00:04:45,5

00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:46,784
was the

480
00:04:46,784 --> 00:04:47,105
truth,

481
00:04:47,105 --> 00:04:47,426

00:04:49,352 --> 00:04:49,673
he

489
00:04:49,673 --> 00:04:49,994

00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:51,169
27

492
00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:51,681
And it
