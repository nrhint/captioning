00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 12 Isaiah sees the latter-day

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
temple, gathering of Israel, and

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
millennial judgment and peace—The proud and

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
wicked will be brought low at the Second

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:12:54,
Coming—Compare 
Isaiah 2. About 559–545 B.C. 

6
00:12:54,0 --> 00:12:54,0
1 The word that Isaiah, the son of

7
00:12:54,0 --> 00:21:49,
Amoz, saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem:

8
00:21:49,0 --> 00:21:49,0
2 And it shall come to pass in the

9
00:21:49,0 --> 00:21:49,0
last days, when the mountain of

10
00:21:49,0 --> 00:21:49,0
the Lord’s house shall be

11
00:21:49,0 --> 00:21:49,0
established in the top of the mountains,

12
00:21:49,0 --> 00:21:49,0
and shall be exalted above the

13
00:21:49,0 --> 00:22:33,
hills, and all nations shall flow unto it.

14
00:22:33,0 --> 00:22:33,0
3 And many people shall go and

15
00:22:33,0 --> 00:22:33,0
say, Come ye, and let us go up to

16
00:22:33,0 --> 00:22:33,0
the mountain of the Lord, to the

17
00:22:33,0 --> 00:22:33,0
house of the God of Jacob; and he

18
00:22:33,0 --> 00:22:33,0
will teach us of his ways, and we

19
00:22:33,0 --> 00:22:33,0
will walk in his paths; for out

20
00:22:33,0 --> 00:22:33,0
of Zion shall go forth the law,

21
00:22:33,0 --> 00:22:19,
and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.

22
00:22:19,0 --> 00:22:19,0
4 And he shall judge among the

23
00:22:19,0 --> 00:22:19,0
nations, and shall rebuke

24
00:22:19,0 --> 00:22:19,0
many people: and they shall beat

25
00:22:19,0 --> 00:22:19,0
their swords into plow-shares,

26
00:22:19,0 --> 00:22:19,0
and their spears into

27
00:22:19,0 --> 00:22:19,0
pruning-hooks—nation shall not lift

28
00:22:19,0 --> 00:22:19,0
up sword against nation,

29
00:22:19,0 --> 00:22:05,
neither shall they learn war any more.

30
00:22:05,0 --> 00:22:05,0
5 O house of Jacob, come ye

31
00:22:05,0 --> 00:22:05,0
and let us walk in the

32
00:22:05,0 --> 00:22:05,0
light of the Lord; yea, come,

33
00:22:05,0 --> 00:22:05,0
for ye have all gone

34
00:22:05,0 --> 00:21:37,
astray, every one to his wicked ways.

35
00:21:37,0 --> 00:21:37,0
6 Therefore, O Lord,

36
00:21:37,0 --> 00:21:37,0
thou hast forsaken thy

37
00:21:37,0 --> 00:21:37,0
people, the house of Jacob,

38
00:21:37,0 --> 00:21:37,0
because they be

39
00:21:37,0 --> 00:21:37,0
replenished from the east, and

40
00:21:37,0 --> 00:21:37,0
hearken unto soothsayers

41
00:21:37,0 --> 00:21:37,0
like the Philistines,

42
00:21:37,0 --> 00:21:37,0
and they please themselves

43
00:21:37,0 --> 00:23:21,
in the children of strangers.

44
00:23:21,0 --> 00:23:21,0
7 Their land also is

45
00:23:21,0 --> 00:23:21,0
full of silver and

46
00:23:21,0 --> 00:23:21,0
gold, neither is there

47
00:23:21,0 --> 00:23:21,0
any end of their

48
00:23:21,0 --> 00:23:21,0
treasures; their land is

49
00:23:21,0 --> 00:23:21,0
also full of horses,

50
00:23:21,0 --> 00:23:21,0
neither is there any

51
00:23:21,0 --> 00:26:52,
end of their chariots.

52
00:26:52,0 --> 00:26:52,0
8 Their land is

53
00:26:52,0 --> 00:26:52,0
also full of idols;

54
00:26:52,0 --> 00:26:52,0
they worship the work

55
00:26:52,0 --> 00:26:52,0
of their own

56
00:26:52,0 --> 00:26:52,0
hands, that which their

57
00:26:52,0 --> 00:35:04,
own fingers have made.

58
00:35:04,0 --> 00:35:04,0
9 And the mean

59
00:35:04,0 --> 00:35:04,0
man boweth not

60
00:35:04,0 --> 00:35:04,0
down, and the great

61
00:35:04,0 --> 00:35:04,0
man humbleth

62
00:35:04,0 --> 00:35:04,0
himself not,

63
00:35:04,0 --> 00:36:48,
therefore, forgive him not.

64
00:36:48,0 --> 00:36:48,0
10 O ye wicked

65
00:36:48,0 --> 00:36:48,0
ones, enter

66
00:36:48,0 --> 00:36:48,0
into the rock, and

67
00:36:48,0 --> 00:36:48,0
hide thee in

68
00:36:48,0 --> 00:36:48,0
the dust, for

69
00:36:48,0 --> 00:36:48,0
the fear of the

70
00:36:48,0 --> 00:36:48,0
Lord and the

71
00:36:48,0 --> 00:36:48,0
glory of his

72
00:36:48,0 --> 00:44:45,
majesty shall smite thee.

73
00:44:45,0 --> 00:44:45,0
11 And it

74
00:44:45,0 --> 00:44:45,0
shall come to pass

75
00:44:45,0 --> 00:44:45,0
that the

76
00:44:45,0 --> 00:44:45,0
lofty looks of man

77
00:44:45,0 --> 00:44:45,0
shall be

78
00:44:45,0 --> 00:44:45,0
humbled, and the

79
00:44:45,0 --> 00:44:45,0
haughtiness of

80
00:44:45,0 --> 00:44:45,0
men shall be

81
00:44:45,0 --> 00:44:45,0
bowed down, and

82
00:44:45,0 --> 00:44:45,0
the Lord

83
00:44:45,0 --> 00:44:45,0
alone shall be

84
00:44:45,0 --> 00:45:57,
exalted in that day.

85
00:45:57,0 --> 00:45:57,0
12 For the

86
00:45:57,0 --> 00:45:57,0
day of the Lord

87
00:45:57,0 --> 00:45:57,0
of Hosts

88
00:45:57,0 --> 00:45:57,0
soon cometh upon

89
00:45:57,0 --> 00:45:57,0
all nations,

90
00:45:57,0 --> 00:45:57,0
yea, upon

91
00:45:57,0 --> 00:45:57,0
every one; yea,

92
00:45:57,0 --> 00:45:57,0
upon the

93
00:45:57,0 --> 00:45:57,0
proud and lofty,

94
00:45:57,0 --> 00:45:57,0
and upon

95
00:45:57,0 --> 00:45:57,0
every one who is

96
00:45:57,0 --> 00:45:57,0
lifted up,

97
00:45:57,0 --> 00:45:57,0
and he shall

98
00:45:57,0 --> 00:50:40,
be brought low.

99
00:50:40,0 --> 00:50:40,0
13 Yea, and

100
00:50:40,0 --> 00:50:40,0
the day of

101
00:50:40,0 --> 00:50:40,0
the Lord

102
00:50:40,0 --> 00:50:40,0
shall come upon

103
00:50:40,0 --> 00:50:40,0
all the

104
00:50:40,0 --> 00:50:40,0
cedars of

105
00:50:40,0 --> 00:50:40,0
Lebanon, for they

106
00:50:40,0 --> 00:50:40,0
are high and

107
00:50:40,0 --> 00:50:40,0
lifted up;

108
00:50:40,0 --> 00:50:40,0
and upon all

109
00:50:40,0 --> 00:55:09,
the oaks of Bashan;

110
00:55:09,0 --> 00:55:09,0
14 And upon

111
00:55:09,0 --> 00:55:09,0
all the

00:55:09,0 --> 00:55:09,0
upon all the

118
00:55:09,0 --> 00:55:09,0
which are

119
00:55:09,0 --> 00:55:09,0
lifted up, and

120
00:55:09,0 --> 00:54:41,
upon every people;

00:54:41,0 --> 00:54:41,0
15 And

00:54:41,0 --> 00:54:41,0
upon every

00:54:41,0 --> 00:54:41,0
upon every

126
00:54:41,0 --> 00:59:10,

00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
17 And

140
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
the

00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0


148
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
haughtiness

149
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
of men

150
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
shall be

151
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
made

152
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0

153
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
the

157
01:00:40,0 --> 01:00:40,0
18 And

158
01:00:40,0 --> 01:00:40,0
the

01:00:40,0 --> 01:00:40,0
utterly

162
01:00:40,0 --> 01:00:26,
abolish.

163
01:00:26,0 --> 01:00:26,0
19 And

177
01:00:26,0 --> 01:00:26,0
for the

01:00:26,0 --> 01:00:26,0
fear

179
01:00:26,0 --> 01:00:26,0
of the

01:00:26,0 --> 01:00:26,0

187
01:00:26,0 --> 01:00:26,0

01:00:26,0 --> 01:00:26,0


189
01:00:26,0 --> 01:00:26,0

01:00:26,0 --> 01:00:26,0
he

194
01:00:26,0 --> 01:05:23,
ariseth to shake terribly the earth.

195
01:05:23,0 --> 01:05:23,0
20 In

day

198
01:05:23,0 --> 01:05:23,0
a man

199

210
01:05:23,0 --> 01:05:23,0


211
01:05:23,0 --> 01:05:23,0
which he

hath

213
01:05:23,0 --> 01:05:23,0

01:08:54,0 --> 01:08:54,0
21 To

225
01:08:54,0 --> 01:08:54,0
