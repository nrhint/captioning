00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,4
Chapter 12 Isaiah sees the latter-day temple,

2
00:00:01,4 --> 00:00:02,8
 gathering of Israel, and millennial judgment and

3
00:00:02,8 --> 00:00:04,2
 peace—The proud and wicked will be brought low at the

4
00:00:04,2 --> 00:00:05,6
 Second Coming—Compare 
Isaiah 2. About 559–545 B.C.

5
00:00:05,6 --> 00:00:07,0


6
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:11,975
1 The word that Isaiah, the son of Amoz, saw

7
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:15,975
 concerning Judah and Jerusalem

8
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,549
2 And it shall come to pass in the last days, when

9
00:00:17,549 --> 00:00:19,149
 the mountain of the Lord’s house shall be

10
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:20,749
 established in the top of the mountains, and shall be

11
00:00:20,749 --> 00:00:22,349
 exalted above the hills, and all nations shall flow

12
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:23,949
 unto it

13
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,257
3 And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and

14
00:00:25,257 --> 00:00:26,59
 let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the

15
00:00:26,59 --> 00:00:27,923
 house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of

16
00:00:27,923 --> 00:00:29,256
 his ways, and we will walk in his paths; for out of

17
00:00:29,256 --> 00:00:30,589
 Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the

18
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:31,922
 Lord from Jerusalem

19
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,499
4 And he shall judge among the nations, and shall

20
00:00:33,499 --> 00:00:35,099
 rebuke many people: and they shall beat their

21
00:00:35,099 --> 00:00:36,699
 swords into plow-shares, and their spears into

22
00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:38,299
 pruning-hooks—nation shall not lift up sword against

23
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:39,899
 nation, neither shall they learn war any more

24
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,54
5 O house of Jacob, come ye and let us walk in the

25
00:00:42,54 --> 00:00:45,207
 light of the Lord; yea, come, for ye have all

26
00:00:45,207 --> 00:00:47,874
 gone astray, every one to his wicked ways

27
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:54,248
6 Therefore, O Lord, thou hast forsaken thy

28
00:00:54,248 --> 00:01:00,648
 people, the house of Jacob, because they be replenished

29
00:01:00,648 --> 00:01:07,048
 from the east, and hearken unto soothsayers like

30
00:01:07,048 --> 00:01:13,448
 the Philistines, and they please themselves in the

31
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:19,848
 children of strangers

32
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:27,746
7 Their land also is full of silver and gold,

33
00:01:27,746 --> 00:01:35,746
 neither is there any end of their treasures; their

34
00:01:35,746 --> 00:01:43,746
 land is also full of horses, neither is there any end

35
00:01:43,746 --> 00:01:51,746
 of their chariots

36
00:01:51,645 --> 00:02:07,645
8 Their land is also full of idols; they worship

37
00:02:07,645 --> 00:02:23,645
 the work of their own hands, that which their own

38
00:02:23,645 --> 00:02:39,645
 fingers have made

39
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:42,16
9 And the mean man boweth not down, and the great

40
00:02:42,16 --> 00:02:44,827
 man humbleth himself not, therefore, forgive him

41
00:02:44,827 --> 00:02:47,494
 not

42
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:50,134
10 O ye wicked ones, enter into the rock, and hide

43
00:02:50,134 --> 00:02:52,801
 thee in the dust, for the fear of the Lord and

44
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:55,468
 the glory of his majesty shall smite thee

45
00:02:55,442 --> 00:03:01,442
11 And it shall come to pass that the lofty looks

46
00:03:01,442 --> 00:03:07,442
 of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of

47
00:03:07,442 --> 00:03:13,442
 men shall be bowed down, and the Lord alone shall be

48
00:03:13,442 --> 00:03:19,442
 exalted in that day

49
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:25,366
12 For the day of the Lord of Hosts soon cometh

50
00:03:25,366 --> 00:03:31,366
 upon all nations, yea, upon every one; yea, upon the

51
00:03:31,366 --> 00:03:37,366
 proud and lofty, and upon every one who is lifted

52
00:03:37,366 --> 00:03:43,366
 up, and he shall be brought low

53
00:03:43,29 --> 00:03:45,957
13 Yea, and the day of the Lord shall come upon

54
00:03:45,957 --> 00:03:48,624
 all the cedars of Lebanon, for they are high and

55
00:03:48,624 --> 00:03:51,291
 lifted up; and upon all the oaks of Bashan

56
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:56,597
14 And upon all the high mountains, and upon all

57
00:03:56,597 --> 00:04:01,93
 the hills, and upon all the nations which are

58
00:04:01,93 --> 00:04:07,263
 lifted up, and upon every people

59
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:46,714
15 And upon every high tower, and upon every

60
00:04:46,714 --> 00:05:26,214
 fenced wall

61
00:05:26,96 --> 00:05:32,293
16 And upon all the ships of the sea, and upon all

62
00:05:32,293 --> 00:05:37,626
 the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant

63
00:05:37,626 --> 00:05:42,959
 pictures

64
00:05:42,909 --> 00:06:06,909
17 And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down,

65
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:30,909
 and the haughtiness of men shall be made low; and

66
00:06:30,909 --> 00:06:54,909
 the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day

67
00:06:54,681 --> 00:07:02,681
18 And the idols he shall utterly abolish

68
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:05,856
19 And they shall go into the holes of the rocks,

69
00:07:05,856 --> 00:07:09,056
 and into the caves of the earth, for the fear of

70
00:07:09,056 --> 00:07:12,256
 the Lord shall come upon them and the glory of his

71
00:07:12,256 --> 00:07:15,456
 majesty shall smite them, when he ariseth to shake

72
00:07:15,456 --> 00:07:18,656
 terribly the earth

73
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:37,272
20 In that day a man shall cast his idols of

74
00:07:37,272 --> 00:07:55,939
 silver, and his idols of gold, which he hath made for

75
00:07:55,939 --> 00:08:14,606
 himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats

76
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:16,027
21 To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into

77
00:08:16,027 --> 00:08:17,627
 the tops of the ragged rocks, for the fear of the

78
00:08:17,627 --> 00:08:19,227
 Lord shall come upon them and the majesty of his

79
00:08:19,227 --> 00:08:20,827
 glory shall smite them, when he ariseth to shake

80
00:08:20,827 --> 00:08:22,427
 terribly the earth

81
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:22,402
22 Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his

82
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:22,402
 nostrils; for wherein is he to be accounted of?
