00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:04,2
Chapter 12 Isaiah sees the latter-day

2
00:00:04,2 --> 00:00:08,4
temple, gathering of Israel, and

3
00:00:08,4 --> 00:00:12,6
millennial judgment and peace—The proud and

4
00:00:12,6 --> 00:00:16,8
wicked will be brought low at the Second

5
00:00:16,8 --> 00:00:21,788
Coming—Compare 
Isaiah 2. About 559–545 B.C. 

6
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:30,288
1 The word that Isaiah, the son of

7
00:00:30,288 --> 00:00:38,705
Amoz, saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem:

8
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,538
2 And it shall come to pass in the

9
00:00:40,538 --> 00:00:42,371
last days, when the mountain of

10
00:00:42,371 --> 00:00:44,204
the Lord’s house shall be

11
00:00:44,204 --> 00:00:46,037
established in the top of the mountains,

12
00:00:46,037 --> 00:00:47,87
and shall be exalted above the

13
00:00:47,87 --> 00:00:49,049
hills, and all nations shall flow unto it.

14
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:49,049
3 And many people shall go and

15
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:49,049
say, Come ye, and let us go up to

16
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:49,049
the mountain of the Lord, to the

17
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:49,049
house of the God of Jacob; and he

18
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:49,049
will teach us of his ways, and we

19
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:49,049
will walk in his paths; for out

20
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:49,049
of Zion shall go forth the law,

21
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:49,516
and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.

22
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:50,016
4 And he shall judge among the

23
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:50,516
nations, and shall rebuke

24
00:00:50,516 --> 00:00:51,016
many people: and they shall beat

25
00:00:51,016 --> 00:00:51,516
their swords into plow-shares,

26
00:00:51,516 --> 00:00:52,016
and their spears into

27
00:00:52,016 --> 00:00:52,516
pruning-hooks—nation shall not lift

28
00:00:52,516 --> 00:00:53,016
up sword against nation,

29
00:00:53,016 --> 00:00:53,453
neither shall they learn war any more.

30
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:56,253
5 O house of Jacob, come ye

31
00:00:56,253 --> 00:00:59,053
and let us walk in the

32
00:00:59,053 --> 00:01:01,853
light of the Lord; yea, come,

33
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:04,653
for ye have all gone

34
00:01:04,653 --> 00:01:07,734
astray, every one to his wicked ways.

35
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:07,623
6 Therefore, O Lord,

36
00:01:07,623 --> 00:01:07,512
thou hast forsaken thy

37
00:01:07,512 --> 00:01:07,401
people, the house of Jacob,

38
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:07,29
because they be

39
00:01:07,29 --> 00:01:07,179
replenished from the east, and

40
00:01:07,179 --> 00:01:07,068
hearken unto soothsayers

41
00:01:07,068 --> 00:01:06,957
like the Philistines,

42
00:01:06,957 --> 00:01:06,846
and they please themselves

43
00:01:06,846 --> 00:01:06,8
in the children of strangers.

44
00:01:06,8 --> 00:01:07,425
7 Their land also is

45
00:01:07,425 --> 00:01:08,05
full of silver and

46
00:01:08,05 --> 00:01:08,675
gold, neither is there

47
00:01:08,675 --> 00:01:09,3
any end of their

48
00:01:09,3 --> 00:01:09,925
treasures; their land is

49
00:01:09,925 --> 00:01:10,55
also full of horses,

50
00:01:10,55 --> 00:01:11,175
neither is there any

51
00:01:11,175 --> 00:01:11,204
end of their chariots.

52
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:11,037
8 Their land is

53
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:10,87
also full of idols;

54
00:01:10,87 --> 00:01:10,703
they worship the work

55
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:10,536
of their own

56
00:01:10,536 --> 00:01:10,369
hands, that which their

57
00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:10,27
own fingers have made.

58
00:01:10,27 --> 00:01:14,437
9 And the mean

59
00:01:14,437 --> 00:01:18,604
man boweth not

60
00:01:18,604 --> 00:01:22,771
down, and the great

61
00:01:22,771 --> 00:01:26,938
man humbleth

62
00:01:26,938 --> 00:01:31,105
himself not,

63
00:01:31,105 --> 00:01:35,195
therefore, forgive him not.

64
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:35,973
10 O ye wicked

65
00:01:35,973 --> 00:01:36,751
ones, enter

66
00:01:36,751 --> 00:01:37,529
into the rock, and

67
00:01:37,529 --> 00:01:38,307
hide thee in

68
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:39,085
the dust, for

69
00:01:39,085 --> 00:01:39,863
the fear of the

70
00:01:39,863 --> 00:01:40,641
Lord and the

71
00:01:40,641 --> 00:01:41,419
glory of his

72
00:01:41,419 --> 00:01:42,235
majesty shall smite thee.

73
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:42,485
11 And it

74
00:01:42,485 --> 00:01:42,735
shall come to pass

75
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:42,985
that the

76
00:01:42,985 --> 00:01:43,235
lofty looks of man

77
00:01:43,235 --> 00:01:43,485
shall be

78
00:01:43,485 --> 00:01:43,735
humbled, and the

79
00:01:43,735 --> 00:01:43,985
haughtiness of

80
00:01:43,985 --> 00:01:44,235
men shall be

81
00:01:44,235 --> 00:01:44,485
bowed down, and

82
00:01:44,485 --> 00:01:44,735
the Lord

83
00:01:44,735 --> 00:01:44,985
alone shall be

84
00:01:44,985 --> 00:01:45,706
exalted in that day.

85
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:45,849
12 For the

86
00:01:45,849 --> 00:01:45,992
day of the Lord

87
00:01:45,992 --> 00:01:46,135
of Hosts

88
00:01:46,135 --> 00:01:46,278
soon cometh upon

89
00:01:46,278 --> 00:01:46,421
all nations,

90
00:01:46,421 --> 00:01:46,564
yea, upon

91
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:46,707
every one; yea,

92
00:01:46,707 --> 00:01:46,85
upon the

93
00:01:46,85 --> 00:01:46,993
proud and lofty,

94
00:01:46,993 --> 00:01:47,136
and upon

95
00:01:47,136 --> 00:01:47,279
every one who is

96
00:01:47,279 --> 00:01:47,422
lifted up,

97
00:01:47,422 --> 00:01:47,565
and he shall

98
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:47,174
be brought low.

99
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:48,719
13 Yea, and

100
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:50,264
the day of

101
00:01:50,264 --> 00:01:51,809
the Lord

102
00:01:51,809 --> 00:01:53,354
shall come upon

103
00:01:53,354 --> 00:01:54,899
all the

104
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:56,444
cedars of

105
00:01:56,444 --> 00:01:57,989
Lebanon, for they

106
00:01:57,989 --> 00:01:59,534
are high and

107
00:01:59,534 --> 00:02:01,079
lifted up;

108
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,624
and upon all

109
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,091

110
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:04,0
14 And upon

111
00:02:04,0 --> 00:02:05,909
all the

00:02:09,545 --> 00:02:10,454
upon all the

00:02:11,363 --> 00:02:12,272
which are

00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:15,168
15 And

00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:24,945
the

141
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:24,945
loftiness

142
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:24,945
of man

143
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:24,945
shall

144
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:24,945
be bowed

145
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:24,945
down,

148
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:24,945
haughtiness

149
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:24,945

150
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:24,945

156
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:24,011

they

165
00:02:42,899 --> 00:02:43,868
shall

earth,

177
00:02:54,527 --> 00:02:55,496
for the

178
00:02:55,496 --> 00:02:56,465
fear

179
00:02:56,465 --> 00:02:57,434
of the

Lord

181
00:02:58,403 --> 00:02:59,372
shall

187
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:05,186

189
00:03:06,155 --> 00:03:07,124
majesty

190
00:03:07,124 --> 00:03:08,093
shall

191
00:03:08,093 --> 00:03:09,062
smite

192
00:03:09,062 --> 00:03:10,031
them, when

193
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:10,0
he

194
00:03:10,0 --> 00:03:11,925
ariseth to shake terribly the earth.

195
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:11,885
20 In

196
00:03:11,885 --> 00:03:11,845
