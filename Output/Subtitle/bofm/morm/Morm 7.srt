00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,75
Chapter 7 Mormon invites the Lamanites of the

2
00:00:01,75 --> 00:00:03,5
 latter days to believe in Christ, accept His gospel,

3
00:00:03,5 --> 00:00:05,25
 and be saved—All who believe the Bible will also

4
00:00:05,25 --> 00:00:07,0
 believe the Book of Mormon. About A.D. 385.

5
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,308
1 And now, behold, I would speak somewhat unto the

6
00:00:09,308 --> 00:00:10,641
 remnant of this people who are spared, if it so

7
00:00:10,641 --> 00:00:11,974
 be that God may give unto them my words, that they

8
00:00:11,974 --> 00:00:13,307
 may know of the things of their fathers; yea, I

9
00:00:13,307 --> 00:00:14,64
 speak unto you, ye remnant of the house of Israel;

10
00:00:14,64 --> 00:00:15,973
 and these are the words which I speak

11
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:39,949
2 Know ye that ye are of the house of Israel

12
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:43,873
3 Know ye that ye must come unto repentance, or ye

13
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:47,873
 cannot be saved

14
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,848
4 Know ye that ye must lay down your weapons of

15
00:00:49,848 --> 00:00:51,848
 war, and delight no more in the shedding of blood,

16
00:00:51,848 --> 00:00:53,848
 and take them not again, save it be that God shall

17
00:00:53,848 --> 00:00:55,848
 command you

18
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:56,822
5 Know ye that ye must come to the knowledge of

19
00:00:56,822 --> 00:00:57,822
 your fathers, and repent of all your sins and

20
00:00:57,822 --> 00:00:58,822
 iniquities, and believe in Jesus Christ, that he is the

21
00:00:58,822 --> 00:00:59,822
 Son of God, and that he was slain by the Jews, and

22
00:00:59,822 --> 00:01:00,822
 by the power of the Father he hath risen again,

23
00:01:00,822 --> 00:01:01,822
 whereby he hath gained the victory over the grave;

24
00:01:01,822 --> 00:01:02,822
 and also in him is the sting of death swallowed

25
00:01:02,822 --> 00:01:03,822
 up

26
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:06,464
6 And he bringeth to pass the resurrection of the

27
00:01:06,464 --> 00:01:09,131
 dead, whereby man must be raised to stand before

28
00:01:09,131 --> 00:01:11,798
 his judgment-seat

29
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:12,772
7 And he hath brought to pass the redemption of

30
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:13,772
 the world, whereby he that is found guiltless before

31
00:01:13,772 --> 00:01:14,772
 him at the judgment day hath it given unto him to

32
00:01:14,772 --> 00:01:15,772
 dwell in the presence of God in his kingdom, to

33
00:01:15,772 --> 00:01:16,772
 sing ceaseless praises with the choirs above, unto

34
00:01:16,772 --> 00:01:17,772
 the Father, and unto the Son, and unto the Holy

35
00:01:17,772 --> 00:01:18,772
 Ghost, which are one God, in a state of happiness

36
00:01:18,772 --> 00:01:19,772
 which hath no end

37
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:25,079
8 Therefore repent, and be baptized in the name of

38
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:30,412
 Jesus, and lay hold upon the gospel of Christ,

39
00:01:30,412 --> 00:01:35,745
 which shall be set before you, not only in this

40
00:01:35,745 --> 00:01:41,078
 record but also in the record which shall come unto

41
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:46,411
 the Gentiles from the Jews, which record shall come

42
00:01:46,411 --> 00:01:51,744
 from the Gentiles unto you

43
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:56,978
9 For behold, this is written for the intent that

44
00:01:56,978 --> 00:02:02,311
 ye may believe that; and if ye believe that ye

45
00:02:02,311 --> 00:02:07,644
 will believe this also; and if ye believe this ye

46
00:02:07,644 --> 00:02:12,977
 will know concerning your fathers, and also the

47
00:02:12,977 --> 00:02:18,31
 marvelous works which were wrought by the power of God

48
00:02:18,31 --> 00:02:23,643
 among them

49
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:23,918
10 And ye will also know that ye are a remnant of

50
00:02:23,918 --> 00:02:24,293
 the seed of Jacob; therefore ye are numbered among

51
00:02:24,293 --> 00:02:24,668
 the people of the first covenant; and if it so be

52
00:02:24,668 --> 00:02:25,043
 that ye believe in Christ, and are baptized,

53
00:02:25,043 --> 00:02:25,418
 first with water, then with fire and with the Holy

54
00:02:25,418 --> 00:02:25,793
 Ghost, following the example of our Savior, according

55
00:02:25,793 --> 00:02:26,168
 to that which he hath commanded us, it shall be

56
00:02:26,168 --> 00:02:26,543
 well with you in the day of judgment. Amen.
