00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:07,25
Chapter 7 Mormon invites the Lamanites of the

2
00:00:07,25 --> 00:00:14,5
latter days to believe in Christ, accept His

3
00:00:14,5 --> 00:00:21,75
gospel, and be saved—All who believe the Bible will

4
00:00:21,75 --> 00:00:29,329
also believe the Book of Mormon. About A.D. 385. 

5
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:29,162
1 And now, behold, I would speak somewhat unto

6
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:28,995
the remnant of this people who are spared, if

7
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:28,828
it so be that God may give unto them my words,

8
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:28,661
that they may know of the things of their

9
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:28,494
fathers; yea, I speak unto you, ye remnant of the

10
00:00:28,494 --> 00:00:28,395
house of Israel; and these are the words which I speak:

11
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:32,799
2 Know ye that ye are of the house of Israel.

12
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:47,299
3 Know ye that ye must come unto

13
00:00:47,299 --> 00:01:01,128
repentance, or ye cannot be saved.

14
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:01,528
4 Know ye that ye must lay down

15
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:01,928
your weapons of war, and delight

16
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:02,328
no more in the shedding of

17
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:02,728
blood, and take them not again, save

18
00:01:02,728 --> 00:01:03,53
it be that God shall command you.

19
00:01:03,53 --> 00:01:04,439
5 Know ye that ye must come to

20
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,348
the knowledge of your fathers,

21
00:01:05,348 --> 00:01:06,257
and repent of all your sins and

22
00:01:06,257 --> 00:01:07,166
iniquities, and believe in

23
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:08,075
Jesus Christ, that he is the Son

24
00:01:08,075 --> 00:01:08,984
of God, and that he was slain by

25
00:01:08,984 --> 00:01:09,893
the Jews, and by the power of

26
00:01:09,893 --> 00:01:10,802
the Father he hath risen again,

27
00:01:10,802 --> 00:01:11,711
whereby he hath gained the

28
00:01:11,711 --> 00:01:12,62
victory over the grave; and also

29
00:01:12,62 --> 00:01:13,874
in him is the sting of death swallowed up.

30
00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:19,124
6 And he bringeth to pass the

31
00:01:19,124 --> 00:01:24,374
resurrection of the dead,

32
00:01:24,374 --> 00:01:29,624
whereby man must be raised to

33
00:01:29,624 --> 00:01:34,227
stand before his judgment-seat.

34
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:35,458
7 And he hath brought to

35
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:36,689
pass the redemption of the

36
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:37,92
world, whereby he that is found

37
00:01:37,92 --> 00:01:39,151
guiltless before him at the

38
00:01:39,151 --> 00:01:40,382
judgment day hath it given

39
00:01:40,382 --> 00:01:41,613
unto him to dwell in the

40
00:01:41,613 --> 00:01:42,844
presence of God in his kingdom,

41
00:01:42,844 --> 00:01:44,075
to sing ceaseless praises

42
00:01:44,075 --> 00:01:45,306
with the choirs above, unto

43
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:46,537
the Father, and unto the Son,

44
00:01:46,537 --> 00:01:47,768
and unto the Holy Ghost,

45
00:01:47,768 --> 00:01:48,999
which are one God, in a state

46
00:01:48,999 --> 00:01:50,644
of happiness which hath no end.

47
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:54,244
8 Therefore repent, and be

48
00:01:54,244 --> 00:01:57,844
baptized in the name of

49
00:01:57,844 --> 00:02:01,444
Jesus, and lay hold upon the

50
00:02:01,444 --> 00:02:05,044
gospel of Christ, which

51
00:02:05,044 --> 00:02:08,644
shall be set before you, not

52
00:02:08,644 --> 00:02:12,244
only in this record but also

53
00:02:12,244 --> 00:02:15,844
in the record which shall

54
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:19,444
come unto the Gentiles from

55
00:02:19,444 --> 00:02:23,044
the Jews, which record

56
00:02:23,044 --> 00:02:26,913
shall come from the Gentiles unto you.

57
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:27,813
9 For behold, this is

58
00:02:27,813 --> 00:02:28,713
written for the intent that ye

59
00:02:28,713 --> 00:02:29,613
may believe that; and if

60
00:02:29,613 --> 00:02:30,513
ye believe that ye will

61
00:02:30,513 --> 00:02:31,413
believe this also; and if ye

62
00:02:31,413 --> 00:02:32,313
believe this ye will know

63
00:02:32,313 --> 00:02:33,213
concerning your fathers,

64
00:02:33,213 --> 00:02:34,113
and also the marvelous

65
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:35,013
works which were wrought by

66
00:02:35,013 --> 00:02:35,355
the power of God among them.

67
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:35,667
10 And ye will also know

68
00:02:35,667 --> 00:02:35,979
that ye are a remnant

69
00:02:35,979 --> 00:02:36,291
of the seed of Jacob;

70
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:36,603
therefore ye are numbered

71
00:02:36,603 --> 00:02:36,915
among the people of the

72
00:02:36,915 --> 00:02:37,227
first covenant; and if it

73
00:02:37,227 --> 00:02:37,539
so be that ye believe

74
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:37,851
in Christ, and are

75
00:02:37,851 --> 00:02:38,163
baptized, first with water,

76
00:02:38,163 --> 00:02:38,475
then with fire and with

77
00:02:38,475 --> 00:02:38,787
the Holy Ghost, following

78
00:02:38,787 --> 00:02:39,099
the example of our

79
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:39,411
Savior, according to that

80
00:02:39,411 --> 00:02:39,723
which he hath commanded us,

81
00:02:39,723 --> 00:02:40,035
it shall be well with

82
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:40,761
you in the day of judgment. Amen.
