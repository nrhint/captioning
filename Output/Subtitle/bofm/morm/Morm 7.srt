Chapter 7 Mormon invites the Lamanites of the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
latter days to believe in Christ, accept His

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
gospel, and be saved—All who believe the Bible will

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:13:08,
also believe the Book of Mormon. About A.D. 385. 

5
00:13:08,0 --> 00:13:08,0
1 And now, behold, I would speak somewhat unto

6
00:13:08,0 --> 00:13:08,0
the remnant of this people who are spared, if

7
00:13:08,0 --> 00:13:08,0
it so be that God may give unto them my words,

8
00:13:08,0 --> 00:13:08,0
that they may know of the things of their

9
00:13:08,0 --> 00:13:08,0
fathers; yea, I speak unto you, ye remnant of the

10
00:13:08,0 --> 00:12:40,
house of Israel; and these are the words which I speak:

11
00:12:40,0 --> 00:12:12,
2 Know ye that ye are of the house of Israel.

12
00:12:12,0 --> 00:12:12,0
3 Know ye that ye must come unto

13
00:12:12,0 --> 00:13:24,
repentance, or ye cannot be saved.

14
00:13:24,0 --> 00:13:24,0
4 Know ye that ye must lay down

15
00:13:24,0 --> 00:13:24,0
your weapons of war, and delight

16
00:13:24,0 --> 00:13:24,0
no more in the shedding of

17
00:13:24,0 --> 00:13:24,0
blood, and take them not again, save

18
00:13:24,0 --> 00:12:56,
it be that God shall command you.

19
00:12:56,0 --> 00:12:56,0
5 Know ye that ye must come to

20
00:12:56,0 --> 00:12:56,0
the knowledge of your fathers,

21
00:12:56,0 --> 00:12:56,0
and repent of all your sins and

22
00:12:56,0 --> 00:12:56,0
iniquities, and believe in

23
00:12:56,0 --> 00:12:56,0
Jesus Christ, that he is the Son

24
00:12:56,0 --> 00:12:56,0
of God, and that he was slain by

25
00:12:56,0 --> 00:12:56,0
the Jews, and by the power of

26
00:12:56,0 --> 00:12:56,0
the Father he hath risen again,

27
00:12:56,0 --> 00:12:56,0
whereby he hath gained the

28
00:12:56,0 --> 00:12:56,0
victory over the grave; and also

29
00:12:56,0 --> 00:12:28,
in him is the sting of death swallowed up.

30
00:12:28,0 --> 00:12:28,0
6 And he bringeth to pass the

31
00:12:28,0 --> 00:12:28,0
resurrection of the dead,

32
00:12:28,0 --> 00:12:28,0
whereby man must be raised to

33
00:12:28,0 --> 00:14:40,
stand before his judgment-seat.

34
00:14:40,0 --> 00:14:40,0
7 And he hath brought to

35
00:14:40,0 --> 00:14:40,0
pass the redemption of the

36
00:14:40,0 --> 00:14:40,0
world, whereby he that is found

37
00:14:40,0 --> 00:14:40,0
guiltless before him at the

38
00:14:40,0 --> 00:14:40,0
judgment day hath it given

39
00:14:40,0 --> 00:14:40,0
unto him to dwell in the

40
00:14:40,0 --> 00:14:40,0
presence of God in his kingdom,

41
00:14:40,0 --> 00:14:40,0
to sing ceaseless praises

42
00:14:40,0 --> 00:14:40,0
with the choirs above, unto

43
00:14:40,0 --> 00:14:40,0
the Father, and unto the Son,

44
00:14:40,0 --> 00:14:40,0
and unto the Holy Ghost,

45
00:14:40,0 --> 00:14:40,0
which are one God, in a state

46
00:14:40,0 --> 00:15:52,
of happiness which hath no end.

47
00:15:52,0 --> 00:15:52,0
8 Therefore repent, and be

48
00:15:52,0 --> 00:15:52,0
baptized in the name of

49
00:15:52,0 --> 00:15:52,0
Jesus, and lay hold upon the

50
00:15:52,0 --> 00:15:52,0
gospel of Christ, which

51
00:15:52,0 --> 00:15:52,0
shall be set before you, not

52
00:15:52,0 --> 00:15:52,0
only in this record but also

53
00:15:52,0 --> 00:15:52,0
in the record which shall

54
00:15:52,0 --> 00:15:52,0
come unto the Gentiles from

55
00:15:52,0 --> 00:15:52,0
the Jews, which record

56
00:15:52,0 --> 00:26:59,
shall come from the Gentiles unto you.

57
00:26:59,0 --> 00:26:59,0
9 For behold, this is

58
00:26:59,0 --> 00:26:59,0
written for the intent that ye

59
00:26:59,0 --> 00:26:59,0
may believe that; and if

60
00:26:59,0 --> 00:26:59,0
ye believe that ye will

61
00:26:59,0 --> 00:26:59,0
believe this also; and if ye

62
00:26:59,0 --> 00:26:59,0
believe this ye will know

63
00:26:59,0 --> 00:26:59,0
concerning your fathers,

64
00:26:59,0 --> 00:26:59,0
and also the marvelous

65
00:26:59,0 --> 00:26:59,0
works which were wrought by

66
00:26:59,0 --> 00:32:09,
the power of God among them.

67
00:32:09,0 --> 00:32:09,0
10 And ye will also know

68
00:32:09,0 --> 00:32:09,0
that ye are a remnant

69
00:32:09,0 --> 00:32:09,0
of the seed of Jacob;

70
00:32:09,0 --> 00:32:09,0
therefore ye are numbered

71
00:32:09,0 --> 00:32:09,0
among the people of the

72
00:32:09,0 --> 00:32:09,0
first covenant; and if it

73
00:32:09,0 --> 00:32:09,0
so be that ye believe

74
00:32:09,0 --> 00:32:09,0
in Christ, and are

75
00:32:09,0 --> 00:32:09,0
baptized, first with water,

76
00:32:09,0 --> 00:32:09,0
then with fire and with

77
00:32:09,0 --> 00:32:09,0
the Holy Ghost, following

78
00:32:09,0 --> 00:32:09,0
the example of our

79
00:32:09,0 --> 00:32:09,0
Savior, according to that

80
00:32:09,0 --> 00:32:09,0
which he hath commanded us,

81
00:32:09,0 --> 00:32:09,0
it shall be well with

82
00:32:09,0 --> 00:37:20,
you in the day of judgment. Amen.
