00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:09,0
Chapter 4 War and carnage continue—The wicked

2
00:00:09,0 --> 00:00:18,0
punish the wicked—Greater wickedness prevails than

3
00:00:18,0 --> 00:00:27,0
ever before in all Israel—Women and children

4
00:00:27,0 --> 00:00:36,0
are sacrificed to idols—The Lamanites begin to

5
00:00:36,0 --> 00:00:45,746
sweep the Nephites before them. About A.D. 363–75. 

6
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
1 And now it came to pass that in the three

7
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
hundred and sixty and third year the

8
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
Nephites did go up with their armies to battle

9
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
against the Lamanites, out of the land Desolation.

10
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
2 And it came to pass that the armies of

11
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
the Nephites were driven back again to the

12
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
land of Desolation. And while they were yet

13
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
weary, a fresh army of the Lamanites did

14
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
come upon them; and they had a sore battle,

15
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
insomuch that the Lamanites did take

16
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
possession of the city Desolation, and did slay

17
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
many of the Nephites, and did take many prisoners.

18
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
3 And the remainder did flee and

19
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
join the inhabitants of the city

20
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
Teancum. Now the city Teancum lay in

21
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
the borders by the seashore; and

22
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
it was also near the city Desolation.

23
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
4 And it was because the

24
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
armies of the Nephites went up unto

25
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
the Lamanites that they began

26
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
to be smitten; for were it

27
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
not for that, the Lamanites

28
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
could have had no power over them.

29
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
5 But, behold, the judgments

30
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
of God will overtake the

31
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
wicked; and it is by the

32
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
wicked that the wicked are

33
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
punished; for it is the wicked

34
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
that stir up the hearts of the

35
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
children of men unto bloodshed.

36
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
6 And it came to pass

37
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
that the Lamanites did

38
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
make preparations to come

39
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
against the city Teancum.

40
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
7 And it came to pass

41
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
in the three hundred

42
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
and sixty and fourth

43
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
year the Lamanites

44
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
did come against the

45
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
city Teancum, that

46
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
they might take

47
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
possession of the city Teancum also.

48
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
8 And it came to pass

49
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
that they were

50
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
repulsed and driven back

51
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
by the Nephites. And

52
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
when the Nephites saw

53
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
that they had driven

54
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
the Lamanites they

55
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
did again boast of

56
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
their own strength; and

57
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
they went forth in

58
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
their own might, and

59
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
took possession again of

60
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
the city Desolation.

61
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
9 And now all

62
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
these things had been

63
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
done, and there

64
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
had been thousands

65
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
slain on both

66
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
sides, both the

67
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
Nephites and the Lamanites.

68
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
10 And it came

69
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
to pass that the

70
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
three hundred

71
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
and sixty and

72
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
sixth year had

73
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
passed away, and the

74
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
Lamanites came

75
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
again upon the

76
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
Nephites to

77
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
battle; and yet the

78
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
Nephites repented

79
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
not of the evil

80
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
they had done,

81
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
but persisted in

82
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
their wickedness continually.

83
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
11 And it is

84
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
impossible for

85
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
the tongue to

86
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
describe, or for

87
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
man to write a

88
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
perfect

89
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
description of the

90
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
horrible scene of

91
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
the blood and

92
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
carnage which was

93
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
among the

94
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
people, both of the

95
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
Nephites and

96
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
of the

97
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
Lamanites; and every

98
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
heart was

99
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
hardened, so that they

100
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
delighted in

101
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
the shedding of blood continually.

102
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
12 And there

103
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
never had

104
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
been so great

105
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
wickedness

106
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
among all the

107
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
children of

108
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
Lehi, nor even

109
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
among all the

110
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
house of

111
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
Israel, according

112
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
to the words

113
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
of the Lord,

114
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
as was among this people.

115
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
13 And it

116
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
came to pass

117
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
that the

118
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
Lamanites did

119
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
take

120
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
possession of the

121
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
city

122
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
Desolation, and this

123
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
because their

124
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
number did

125
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
exceed the

126
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
number of the Nephites.

127
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
14 And they

128
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
did also

129
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
march

130
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
forward against

131
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
the city

132
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
Teancum, and

133
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
did drive

134
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
the

135
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
inhabitants forth

136
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
out of her,

137
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
and did take

138
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
many

139
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
prisoners both

140
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
women and

141
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
children, and

142
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
did offer

143
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
them up as

144
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
sacrifices

145
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
unto their idol gods.

146
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
15 And it

147
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
came to

148
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
pass that in

149
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
the three

150
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
hundred

151
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
and sixty

152
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
and seventh

153
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
year, the

154
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
Nephites

155
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
being

156
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
angry because

157
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
the

158
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
Lamanites had

159
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
sacrificed

160
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
their women

161
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
and their

162
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
children,

163
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
that they

164
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
did go

165
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
against the

166
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
Lamanites

167
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
with

168
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
exceedingly

169
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
great anger,

170
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
insomuch

171
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
that they

172
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
did beat

173
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
again the

174
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
Lamanites,

175
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
and drive them out of their lands.

176
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
16 And

177
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
the

178
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
Lamanites did

179
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
not come

180
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
again

181
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
against the

182
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
Nephites

183
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
until the

184
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
three

185
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
hundred and

186
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
seventy

187
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
and fifth year.

188
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
17 And

189
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
in this

190
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
year they

191
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
did

192
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
come down

193
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
against

194
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
the

195
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
Nephites with

196
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
all

197
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
their

198
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
powers; and

199
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
they were

200
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
not

201
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,746
