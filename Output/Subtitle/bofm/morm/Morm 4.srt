00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,4
Chapter 4 War and carnage continue—The wicked

2
00:00:01,4 --> 00:00:02,8
 punish the wicked—Greater wickedness prevails than

3
00:00:02,8 --> 00:00:04,2
 ever before in all Israel—Women and children are

4
00:00:04,2 --> 00:00:05,6
 sacrificed to idols—The Lamanites begin to sweep the

5
00:00:05,6 --> 00:00:07,0
 Nephites before them. About A.D. 363–75.

6
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,975
1 And now it came to pass that in the three

7
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:11,975
 hundred and sixty and third year the Nephites did go up

8
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:13,975
 with their armies to battle against the Lamanites,

9
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:15,975
 out of the land Desolation

10
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,092
2 And it came to pass that the armies of the

11
00:00:17,092 --> 00:00:18,235
 Nephites were driven back again to the land of

12
00:00:18,235 --> 00:00:19,378
 Desolation. And while they were yet weary, a fresh army of

13
00:00:19,378 --> 00:00:20,521
 the Lamanites did come upon them; and they had a

14
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:21,664
 sore battle, insomuch that the Lamanites did take

15
00:00:21,664 --> 00:00:22,807
 possession of the city Desolation, and did slay

16
00:00:22,807 --> 00:00:23,95
 many of the Nephites, and did take many prisoners

17
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,924
3 And the remainder did flee and join the

18
00:00:25,924 --> 00:00:27,924
 inhabitants of the city Teancum. Now the city Teancum lay

19
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:29,924
 in the borders by the seashore; and it was also

20
00:00:29,924 --> 00:00:31,924
 near the city Desolation

21
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,899
4 And it was because the armies of the Nephites

22
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,899
 went up unto the Lamanites that they began to be

23
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:37,899
 smitten; for were it not for that, the Lamanites

24
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:39,899
 could have had no power over them

25
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,873
5 But, behold, the judgments of God will overtake

26
00:00:41,873 --> 00:00:43,873
 the wicked; and it is by the wicked that the

27
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:45,873
 wicked are punished; for it is the wicked that stir up

28
00:00:45,873 --> 00:00:47,873
 the hearts of the children of men unto bloodshed

29
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:55,848
6 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did make

30
00:00:55,848 --> 00:01:03,848
 preparations to come against the city Teancum

31
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,797
7 And it came to pass in the three hundred and

32
00:01:05,797 --> 00:01:07,797
 sixty and fourth year the Lamanites did come against

33
00:01:07,797 --> 00:01:09,797
 the city Teancum, that they might take possession

34
00:01:09,797 --> 00:01:11,797
 of the city Teancum also

35
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:15,772
8 And it came to pass that they were repulsed and

36
00:01:15,772 --> 00:01:19,772
 driven back by the Nephites. And when the Nephites

37
00:01:19,772 --> 00:01:23,772
 saw that they had driven the Lamanites they did

38
00:01:23,772 --> 00:01:27,772
 again boast of their own strength; and they went

39
00:01:27,772 --> 00:01:31,772
 forth in their own might, and took possession again

40
00:01:31,772 --> 00:01:35,772
 of the city Desolation

41
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:43,696
9 And now all these things had been done, and

42
00:01:43,696 --> 00:01:51,696
 there had been thousands slain on both sides, both the

43
00:01:51,696 --> 00:01:59,696
 Nephites and the Lamanites

44
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:00,953
10 And it came to pass that the three hundred and

45
00:02:00,953 --> 00:02:02,285
 sixty and sixth year had passed away, and the

46
00:02:02,285 --> 00:02:03,618
 Lamanites came again upon the Nephites to battle; and

47
00:02:03,618 --> 00:02:04,951
 yet the Nephites repented not of the evil they had

48
00:02:04,951 --> 00:02:06,285
 done, but persisted in their wickedness

49
00:02:06,285 --> 00:02:07,618
 continually

50
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:08,737
11 And it is impossible for the tongue to

51
00:02:08,737 --> 00:02:09,88
 describe, or for man to write a perfect description of the

52
00:02:09,88 --> 00:02:11,023
 horrible scene of the blood and carnage which was

53
00:02:11,023 --> 00:02:12,166
 among the people, both of the Nephites and of the

54
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:13,309
 Lamanites; and every heart was hardened, so that

55
00:02:13,309 --> 00:02:14,452
 they delighted in the shedding of blood

56
00:02:14,452 --> 00:02:15,595
 continually

57
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:17,569
12 And there never had been so great wickedness

58
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:19,569
 among all the children of Lehi, nor even among all

59
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:21,569
 the house of Israel, according to the words of the

60
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:23,569
 Lord, as was among this people

61
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,543
13 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did take

62
00:02:25,543 --> 00:02:27,543
 possession of the city Desolation, and this

63
00:02:27,543 --> 00:02:29,543
 because their number did exceed the number of the

64
00:02:29,543 --> 00:02:31,543
 Nephites

65
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,118
14 And they did also march forward against the

66
00:02:33,118 --> 00:02:34,718
 city Teancum, and did drive the inhabitants forth out

67
00:02:34,718 --> 00:02:36,318
 of her, and did take many prisoners both women

68
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:37,918
 and children, and did offer them up as sacrifices

69
00:02:37,918 --> 00:02:39,518
 unto their idol gods

70
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:45,207
15 And it came to pass that in the three hundred

71
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:50,921
 and sixty and seventh year, the Nephites being

72
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:56,635
 angry because the Lamanites had sacrificed their women

73
00:02:56,635 --> 00:03:02,349
 and their children, that they did go against the

74
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:08,063
 Lamanites with exceedingly great anger, insomuch

75
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:13,777
 that they did beat again the Lamanites, and drive

76
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:19,491
 them out of their lands

77
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:22,033
16 And the Lamanites did not come again against

78
00:03:22,033 --> 00:03:24,7
 the Nephites until the three hundred and seventy and

79
00:03:24,7 --> 00:03:27,367
 fifth year

80
00:03:27,34 --> 00:03:29,34
17 And in this year they did come down against the

81
00:03:29,34 --> 00:03:31,34
 Nephites with all their powers; and they were not

82
00:03:31,34 --> 00:03:33,34
 numbered because of the greatness of their

83
00:03:33,34 --> 00:03:35,34
 number

84
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:43,315
18 And from this time forth did the Nephites gain

85
00:03:43,315 --> 00:03:51,315
 no power over the Lamanites, but began to be swept

86
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:59,315
 off by them even as a dew before the sun

87
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,239
19 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did come

88
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:03,239
 down against the city Desolation; and there was

89
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,239
 an exceedingly sore battle fought in the land

90
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:07,239
 Desolation, in the which they did beat the Nephites

91
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:10,414
20 And they fled again from before them, and they

92
00:04:10,414 --> 00:04:13,614
 came to the city Boaz; and there they did stand

93
00:04:13,614 --> 00:04:16,814
 against the Lamanites with exceeding boldness,

94
00:04:16,814 --> 00:04:20,014
 insomuch that the Lamanites did not beat them until

95
00:04:20,014 --> 00:04:23,214
 they had come again the second time

96
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:25,163
21 And when they had come the second time, the

97
00:04:25,163 --> 00:04:27,163
 Nephites were driven and slaughtered with an

98
00:04:27,163 --> 00:04:29,163
 exceedingly great slaughter; their women and their

99
00:04:29,163 --> 00:04:31,163
 children were again sacrificed unto idols

100
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:33,805
22 And it came to pass that the Nephites did again

101
00:04:33,805 --> 00:04:36,472
 flee from before them, taking all the inhabitants

102
00:04:36,472 --> 00:04:39,139
 with them, both in towns and villages

103
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:39,612
23 And now I, Mormon, seeing that the Lamanites

104
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:40,112
 were about to overthrow the land, therefore I did go

105
00:04:40,112 --> 00:04:40,612
 to the hill Shim, and did take up all the records

106
00:04:40,612 --> 00:04:41,112
 which Ammaron had hid up unto the Lord.
