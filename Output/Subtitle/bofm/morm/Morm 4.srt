00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 4 War and carnage continue—The wicked

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
punish the wicked—Greater wickedness prevails than

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
ever before in all Israel—Women and children

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
are sacrificed to idols—The Lamanites begin to

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:04:43,
sweep the Nephites before them. About A.D. 363–75. 

6
00:04:43,0 --> 00:04:43,0
1 And now it came to pass that in the three

7
00:04:43,0 --> 00:04:43,0
hundred and sixty and third year the

8
00:04:43,0 --> 00:04:43,0
Nephites did go up with their armies to battle

9
00:04:43,0 --> 00:07:53,
against the Lamanites, out of the land Desolation.

10
00:07:53,0 --> 00:07:53,0
2 And it came to pass that the armies of

11
00:07:53,0 --> 00:07:53,0
the Nephites were driven back again to the

12
00:07:53,0 --> 00:07:53,0
land of Desolation. And while they were yet

13
00:07:53,0 --> 00:07:53,0
weary, a fresh army of the Lamanites did

14
00:07:53,0 --> 00:07:53,0
come upon them; and they had a sore battle,

15
00:07:53,0 --> 00:07:53,0
insomuch that the Lamanites did take

16
00:07:53,0 --> 00:07:53,0
possession of the city Desolation, and did slay

17
00:07:53,0 --> 00:07:39,
many of the Nephites, and did take many prisoners.

18
00:07:39,0 --> 00:07:39,0
3 And the remainder did flee and

19
00:07:39,0 --> 00:07:39,0
join the inhabitants of the city

20
00:07:39,0 --> 00:07:39,0
Teancum. Now the city Teancum lay in

21
00:07:39,0 --> 00:07:39,0
the borders by the seashore; and

22
00:07:39,0 --> 00:10:21,
it was also near the city Desolation.

23
00:10:21,0 --> 00:10:21,0
4 And it was because the

24
00:10:21,0 --> 00:10:21,0
armies of the Nephites went up unto

25
00:10:21,0 --> 00:10:21,0
the Lamanites that they began

26
00:10:21,0 --> 00:10:21,0
to be smitten; for were it

27
00:10:21,0 --> 00:10:21,0
not for that, the Lamanites

28
00:10:21,0 --> 00:15:31,
could have had no power over them.

29
00:15:31,0 --> 00:15:31,0
5 But, behold, the judgments

30
00:15:31,0 --> 00:15:31,0
of God will overtake the

31
00:15:31,0 --> 00:15:31,0
wicked; and it is by the

32
00:15:31,0 --> 00:15:31,0
wicked that the wicked are

33
00:15:31,0 --> 00:15:31,0
punished; for it is the wicked

34
00:15:31,0 --> 00:15:31,0
that stir up the hearts of the

35
00:15:31,0 --> 00:24:41,
children of men unto bloodshed.

36
00:24:41,0 --> 00:24:41,0
6 And it came to pass

37
00:24:41,0 --> 00:24:41,0
that the Lamanites did

38
00:24:41,0 --> 00:24:41,0
make preparations to come

39
00:24:41,0 --> 00:24:13,
against the city Teancum.

40
00:24:13,0 --> 00:24:13,0
7 And it came to pass

41
00:24:13,0 --> 00:24:13,0
in the three hundred

42
00:24:13,0 --> 00:24:13,0
and sixty and fourth

43
00:24:13,0 --> 00:24:13,0
year the Lamanites

44
00:24:13,0 --> 00:24:13,0
did come against the

45
00:24:13,0 --> 00:24:13,0
city Teancum, that

46
00:24:13,0 --> 00:24:13,0
they might take

47
00:24:13,0 --> 00:25:25,
possession of the city Teancum also.

48
00:25:25,0 --> 00:25:25,0
8 And it came to pass

49
00:25:25,0 --> 00:25:25,0
that they were

50
00:25:25,0 --> 00:25:25,0
repulsed and driven back

51
00:25:25,0 --> 00:25:25,0
by the Nephites. And

52
00:25:25,0 --> 00:25:25,0
when the Nephites saw

53
00:25:25,0 --> 00:25:25,0
that they had driven

54
00:25:25,0 --> 00:25:25,0
the Lamanites they

55
00:25:25,0 --> 00:25:25,0
did again boast of

56
00:25:25,0 --> 00:25:25,0
their own strength; and

57
00:25:25,0 --> 00:25:25,0
they went forth in

58
00:25:25,0 --> 00:25:25,0
their own might, and

59
00:25:25,0 --> 00:25:25,0
took possession again of

60
00:25:25,0 --> 00:27:37,
the city Desolation.

61
00:27:37,0 --> 00:27:37,0
9 And now all

62
00:27:37,0 --> 00:27:37,0
these things had been

63
00:27:37,0 --> 00:27:37,0
done, and there

64
00:27:37,0 --> 00:27:37,0
had been thousands

65
00:27:37,0 --> 00:27:37,0
slain on both

66
00:27:37,0 --> 00:27:37,0
sides, both the

67
00:27:37,0 --> 00:34:32,
Nephites and the Lamanites.

68
00:34:32,0 --> 00:34:32,0
10 And it came

69
00:34:32,0 --> 00:34:32,0
to pass that the

70
00:34:32,0 --> 00:34:32,0
three hundred

71
00:34:32,0 --> 00:34:32,0
and sixty and

72
00:34:32,0 --> 00:34:32,0
sixth year had

73
00:34:32,0 --> 00:34:32,0
passed away, and the

74
00:34:32,0 --> 00:34:32,0
Lamanites came

75
00:34:32,0 --> 00:34:32,0
again upon the

76
00:34:32,0 --> 00:34:32,0
Nephites to

77
00:34:32,0 --> 00:34:32,0
battle; and yet the

78
00:34:32,0 --> 00:34:32,0
Nephites repented

79
00:34:32,0 --> 00:34:32,0
not of the evil

80
00:34:32,0 --> 00:34:32,0
they had done,

81
00:34:32,0 --> 00:34:32,0
but persisted in

82
00:34:32,0 --> 00:35:44,
their wickedness continually.

83
00:35:44,0 --> 00:35:44,0
11 And it is

84
00:35:44,0 --> 00:35:44,0
impossible for

85
00:35:44,0 --> 00:35:44,0
the tongue to

86
00:35:44,0 --> 00:35:44,0
describe, or for

87
00:35:44,0 --> 00:35:44,0
man to write a

88
00:35:44,0 --> 00:35:44,0
perfect

89
00:35:44,0 --> 00:35:44,0
description of the

90
00:35:44,0 --> 00:35:44,0
horrible scene of

91
00:35:44,0 --> 00:35:44,0
the blood and

92
00:35:44,0 --> 00:35:44,0
carnage which was

93
00:35:44,0 --> 00:35:44,0
among the

94
00:35:44,0 --> 00:35:44,0
people, both of the

95
00:35:44,0 --> 00:35:44,0
Nephites and

96
00:35:44,0 --> 00:35:44,0
of the

97
00:35:44,0 --> 00:35:44,0
Lamanites; and every

98
00:35:44,0 --> 00:35:44,0
heart was

99
00:35:44,0 --> 00:35:44,0
hardened, so that they

100
00:35:44,0 --> 00:35:44,0
delighted in

101
00:35:44,0 --> 00:56:50,
the shedding of blood continually.

102
00:56:50,0 --> 00:56:50,0
12 And there

103
00:56:50,0 --> 00:56:50,0
never had

104
00:56:50,0 --> 00:56:50,0
been so great

105
00:56:50,0 --> 00:56:50,0
wickedness

106
00:56:50,0 --> 00:56:50,0
among all the

107
00:56:50,0 --> 00:56:50,0
children of

108
00:56:50,0 --> 00:56:50,0
Lehi, nor even

109
00:56:50,0 --> 00:56:50,0
among all the

110
00:56:50,0 --> 00:56:50,0
house of

111
00:56:50,0 --> 00:56:50,0
Israel, according

112
00:56:50,0 --> 00:56:50,0
to the words

113
00:56:50,0 --> 00:56:50,0
of the Lord,

114
00:56:50,0 --> 00:56:22,
as was among this people.

115
00:56:22,0 --> 00:56:22,0
13 And it

116
00:56:22,0 --> 00:56:22,0
came to pass

117
00:56:22,0 --> 00:56:22,0
that the

118
00:56:22,0 --> 00:56:22,0
Lamanites did

119
00:56:22,0 --> 00:56:22,0
take

120
00:56:22,0 --> 00:56:22,0
possession of the

121
00:56:22,0 --> 00:56:22,0
city

122
00:56:22,0 --> 00:56:22,0
Desolation, and this

123
00:56:22,0 --> 00:56:22,0
because their

124
00:56:22,0 --> 00:56:22,0
number did

125
00:56:22,0 --> 00:56:22,0
exceed the

126
00:56:22,0 --> 00:55:54,
number of the Nephites.

127
00:55:54,0 --> 00:55:54,0
14 And they

128
00:55:54,0 --> 00:55:54,0
did also

129
00:55:54,0 --> 00:55:54,0
march

130
00:55:54,0 --> 00:55:54,0
forward against

131
00:55:54,0 --> 00:55:54,0
the city

132
00:55:54,0 --> 00:55:54,0
Teancum, and

133
00:55:54,0 --> 00:55:54,0
did drive

134
00:55:54,0 --> 00:55:54,0
the

135
00:55:54,0 --> 00:55:54,0
inhabitants forth

136
00:55:54,0 --> 00:55:54,0
out of her,

137
00:55:54,0 --> 00:55:54,0
and did take

138
00:55:54,0 --> 00:55:54,0
many

139
00:55:54,0 --> 00:55:54,0
prisoners both

140
00:55:54,0 --> 00:55:54,0
women and

141
00:55:54,0 --> 00:55:54,0
children, and

142
00:55:54,0 --> 00:55:54,0
did offer

143
00:55:54,0 --> 00:55:54,0
them up as

144
00:55:54,0 --> 00:55:54,0
sacrifices

145
00:55:54,0 --> 00:56:08,
unto their idol gods.

146
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
15 And it

147
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
came to

148
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
pass that in

149
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
the three

150
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
hundred

151
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
and sixty

152
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
and seventh

153
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
year, the

154
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
Nephites

155
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
being

156
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
angry because

157
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
the

158
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
Lamanites had

159
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
sacrificed

160
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
their women

161
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
and their

162
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
children,

163
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
that they

164
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
did go

165
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
against the

166
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
Lamanites

167
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
with

168
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
exceedingly

169
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
great anger,

170
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
insomuch

171
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
that they

172
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
did beat

173
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
again the

174
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
Lamanites,

175
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:22,
and drive them out of their lands.

176
00:56:22,0 --> 00:56:22,0
16 And

177
00:56:22,0 --> 00:56:22,0
the

178
00:56:22,0 --> 00:56:22,0
Lamanites did

179
00:56:22,0 --> 00:56:22,0
not come

180
00:56:22,0 --> 00:56:22,0
again

181
00:56:22,0 --> 00:56:22,0
against the

182
00:56:22,0 --> 00:56:22,0
Nephites

183
00:56:22,0 --> 00:56:22,0
until the

184
00:56:22,0 --> 00:56:22,0
three

185
00:56:22,0 --> 00:56:22,0
hundred and

186
00:56:22,0 --> 00:56:22,0
seventy

187
00:56:22,0 --> 00:55:54,
and fifth year.

188
00:55:54,0 --> 00:55:54,0
17 And

189
00:55:54,0 --> 00:55:54,0
in this

190
00:55:54,0 --> 00:55:54,0
year they

191
00:55:54,0 --> 00:55:54,0
did

192
00:55:54,0 --> 00:55:54,0
come down

193
00:55:54,0 --> 00:55:54,0
against

194
00:55:54,0 --> 00:55:54,0
the

195
00:55:54,0 --> 00:55:54,0
Nephites with

196
00:55:54,0 --> 00:55:54,0
all

197
00:55:54,0 --> 00:55:54,0
their

198
00:55:54,0 --> 00:55:54,0
powers; and

199
00:55:54,0 --> 00:55:54,0
they were

200
00:55:54,0 --> 00:55:54,0
not

201
00:55:54,0 --> 00:55:54,0
numbered

202
00:55:54,0 --> 00:55:54,0
because of

203
00:55:54,0 --> 00:55:54,0
the

204
00:55:54,0 --> 00:56:08,
greatness of their number.

205
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
18 And

206
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
from

207
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
this time

208
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
forth

209
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
did the

210
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0


211
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
Nephites gain

212
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
no

213
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
power over

214
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
the

215
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0


216
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
Lamanites, but

217
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
began to

218
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
be

219
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
swept off

220
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
by them

221
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
even

222
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:22,
as a dew before the sun.

223
00:56:22,0 --> 00:56:22,0
19 And

224
00:56:22,0 --> 00:56:22,0
it
