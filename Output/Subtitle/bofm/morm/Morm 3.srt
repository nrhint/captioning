00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,167
Chapter 3 Mormon cries repentance unto the

2
00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:02,334
 Nephites—They gain a great victory and glory in their own

3
00:00:02,334 --> 00:00:03,501
 strength—Mormon refuses to lead them, and his

4
00:00:03,501 --> 00:00:04,668
 prayers for them are without faith—The Book of Mormon

5
00:00:04,668 --> 00:00:05,835
 invites the twelve tribes of Israel to believe

6
00:00:05,835 --> 00:00:07,002
 the gospel. About A.D. 360–62.

7
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,575
1 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did not

8
00:00:09,575 --> 00:00:11,175
 come to battle again until ten years more had

9
00:00:11,175 --> 00:00:12,775
 passed away. And behold, I had employed my people, the

10
00:00:12,775 --> 00:00:14,375
 Nephites, in preparing their lands and their arms

11
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:15,975
 against the time of battle

12
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,949
2 And it came to pass that the Lord did say unto

13
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:19,949
 me: Cry unto this people—Repent ye, and come unto

14
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:21,949
 me, and be ye baptized, and build up again my

15
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:23,949
 church, and ye shall be spared

16
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,524
3 And I did cry unto this people, but it was in

17
00:00:25,524 --> 00:00:27,124
 vain; and they did not realize that it was the Lord

18
00:00:27,124 --> 00:00:28,724
 that had spared them, and granted unto them a

19
00:00:28,724 --> 00:00:30,324
 chance for repentance. And behold they did harden

20
00:00:30,324 --> 00:00:31,924
 their hearts against the Lord their God

21
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,232
4 And it came to pass that after this tenth year

22
00:00:33,232 --> 00:00:34,565
 had passed away, making, in the whole, three

23
00:00:34,565 --> 00:00:35,898
 hundred and sixty years from the coming of Christ, the

24
00:00:35,898 --> 00:00:37,231
 king of the Lamanites sent an epistle unto me,

25
00:00:37,231 --> 00:00:38,564
 which gave unto me to know that they were preparing to

26
00:00:38,564 --> 00:00:39,897
 come again to battle against us

27
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,473
5 And it came to pass that I did cause my people

28
00:00:41,473 --> 00:00:43,073
 that they should gather themselves together at the

29
00:00:43,073 --> 00:00:44,673
 land Desolation, to a city which was in the

30
00:00:44,673 --> 00:00:46,273
 borders, by the narrow pass which led into the land

31
00:00:46,273 --> 00:00:47,873
 southward

32
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,848
6 And there we did place our armies, that we might

33
00:00:49,848 --> 00:00:51,848
 stop the armies of the Lamanites, that they might

34
00:00:51,848 --> 00:00:53,848
 not get possession of any of our lands; therefore

35
00:00:53,848 --> 00:00:55,848
 we did fortify against them with all our force

36
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:58,489
7 And it came to pass that in the three hundred

37
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:01,156
 and sixty and first year the Lamanites did come down

38
00:01:01,156 --> 00:01:03,823
 to the city of Desolation to battle against us;

39
00:01:03,823 --> 00:01:06,49
 and it came to pass that in that year we did beat

40
00:01:06,49 --> 00:01:09,157
 them, insomuch that they did return to their own

41
00:01:09,157 --> 00:01:11,824
 lands again

42
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:13,772
8 And in the three hundred and sixty and second

43
00:01:13,772 --> 00:01:15,772
 year they did come down again to battle. And we did

44
00:01:15,772 --> 00:01:17,772
 beat them again, and did slay a great number of

45
00:01:17,772 --> 00:01:19,772
 them, and their dead were cast into the sea

46
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,079
9 And now, because of this great thing which my

47
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:22,412
 people, the Nephites, had done, they began to boast

48
00:01:22,412 --> 00:01:23,745
 in their own strength, and began to swear before

49
00:01:23,745 --> 00:01:25,078
 the heavens that they would avenge themselves of

50
00:01:25,078 --> 00:01:26,411
 the blood of their brethren who had been slain by

51
00:01:26,411 --> 00:01:27,744
 their enemies

52
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:29,721
10 And they did swear by the heavens, and also by

53
00:01:29,721 --> 00:01:31,721
 the throne of God, that they would go up to battle

54
00:01:31,721 --> 00:01:33,721
 against their enemies, and would cut them off

55
00:01:33,721 --> 00:01:35,721
 from the face of the land

56
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,696
11 And it came to pass that I, Mormon, did utterly

57
00:01:37,696 --> 00:01:39,696
 refuse from this time forth to be a commander and

58
00:01:39,696 --> 00:01:41,696
 a leader of this people, because of their

59
00:01:41,696 --> 00:01:43,696
 wickedness and abomination

60
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:45,956
12 Behold, I had led them, notwithstanding their

61
00:01:45,956 --> 00:01:48,242
 wickedness I had led them many times to battle, and

62
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:50,528
 had loved them, according to the love of God

63
00:01:50,528 --> 00:01:52,814
 which was in me, with all my heart; and my soul had

64
00:01:52,814 --> 00:01:55,1
 been poured out in prayer unto my God all the day

65
00:01:55,1 --> 00:01:57,386
 long for them; nevertheless, it was without faith,

66
00:01:57,386 --> 00:01:59,672
 because of the hardness of their hearts

67
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:02,287
13 And thrice have I delivered them out of the

68
00:02:02,287 --> 00:02:04,954
 hands of their enemies, and they have repented not of

69
00:02:04,954 --> 00:02:07,621
 their sins

70
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:08,927
14 And when they had sworn by all that had been

71
00:02:08,927 --> 00:02:10,26
 forbidden them by our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,

72
00:02:10,26 --> 00:02:11,593
 that they would go up unto their enemies to

73
00:02:11,593 --> 00:02:12,926
 battle, and avenge themselves of the blood of their

74
00:02:12,926 --> 00:02:14,259
 brethren, behold the voice of the Lord came unto me,

75
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,592
 saying

76
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:17,569
15 Vengeance is mine, and I will repay; and

77
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:19,569
 because this people repented not after I had delivered

78
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:21,569
 them, behold, they shall be cut off from the face

79
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:23,569
 of the earth

80
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,829
16 And it came to pass that I utterly refused to

81
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:28,115
 go up against mine enemies; and I did even as the

82
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:30,401
 Lord had commanded me; and I did stand as an idle

83
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:32,687
 witness to manifest unto the world the things which

84
00:02:32,687 --> 00:02:34,973
 I saw and heard, according to the manifestations

85
00:02:34,973 --> 00:02:37,259
 of the Spirit which had testified of things to

86
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:39,545
 come

87
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,493
17 Therefore I write unto you, Gentiles, and also

88
00:02:41,493 --> 00:02:43,493
 unto you, house of Israel, when the work shall

89
00:02:43,493 --> 00:02:45,493
 commence, that ye shall be about to prepare to return

90
00:02:45,493 --> 00:02:47,493
 to the land of your inheritance

91
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,067
18 Yea, behold, I write unto all the ends of the

92
00:02:49,067 --> 00:02:50,667
 earth; yea, unto you, twelve tribes of Israel, who

93
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:52,267
 shall be judged according to your works by the

94
00:02:52,267 --> 00:02:53,867
 twelve whom Jesus chose to be his disciples in the

95
00:02:53,867 --> 00:02:55,467
 land of Jerusalem

96
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:57,042
19 And I write also unto the remnant of this

97
00:02:57,042 --> 00:02:58,642
 people, who shall also be judged by the twelve whom

98
00:02:58,642 --> 00:03:00,242
 Jesus chose in this land; and they shall be judged by

99
00:03:00,242 --> 00:03:01,842
 the other twelve whom Jesus chose in the land of

100
00:03:01,842 --> 00:03:03,442
 Jerusalem

101
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:04,56
20 And these things doth the Spirit manifest unto

102
00:03:04,56 --> 00:03:05,703
 me; therefore I write unto you all. And for this

103
00:03:05,703 --> 00:03:06,846
 cause I write unto you, that ye may know that ye

104
00:03:06,846 --> 00:03:07,989
 must all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ,

105
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:09,132
 yea, every soul who belongs to the whole human

106
00:03:09,132 --> 00:03:10,275
 family of Adam; and ye must stand to be judged of your

107
00:03:10,275 --> 00:03:11,418
 works, whether they be good or evil

108
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:12,724
21 And also that ye may believe the gospel of

109
00:03:12,724 --> 00:03:14,057
 Jesus Christ, which ye shall have among you; and also

110
00:03:14,057 --> 00:03:15,39
 that the Jews, the covenant people of the Lord,

111
00:03:15,39 --> 00:03:16,723
 shall have other witness besides him whom they saw

112
00:03:16,723 --> 00:03:18,056
 and heard, that Jesus, whom they slew, was the very

113
00:03:18,056 --> 00:03:19,389
 Christ and the very God

114
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:19,699
22 And I would that I could persuade all ye ends

115
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,032
 of the earth to repent and prepare to stand before

116
00:03:20,032 --> 00:03:20,365
 the judgment-seat of Christ.
