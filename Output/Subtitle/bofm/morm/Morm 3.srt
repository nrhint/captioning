00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 3 Mormon cries repentance unto the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Nephites—They gain a great victory and glory in

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
their own strength—Mormon refuses to lead them,

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and his prayers for them are without

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
faith—The Book of Mormon invites the twelve tribes of

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:13:08,
Israel to believe the gospel. About A.D. 360–62. 

7
00:13:08,0 --> 00:13:08,0
1 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did

8
00:13:08,0 --> 00:13:08,0
not come to battle again until ten years more

9
00:13:08,0 --> 00:13:08,0
had passed away. And behold, I had employed

10
00:13:08,0 --> 00:13:08,0
my people, the Nephites, in preparing their

11
00:13:08,0 --> 00:12:40,
lands and their arms against the time of battle.

12
00:12:40,0 --> 00:12:40,0
2 And it came to pass that the Lord did say

13
00:12:40,0 --> 00:12:40,0
unto me: Cry unto this people—Repent ye, and

14
00:12:40,0 --> 00:12:40,0
come unto me, and be ye baptized, and build

15
00:12:40,0 --> 00:16:52,
up again my church, and ye shall be spared.

16
00:16:52,0 --> 00:16:52,0
3 And I did cry unto this people, but

17
00:16:52,0 --> 00:16:52,0
it was in vain; and they did not realize

18
00:16:52,0 --> 00:16:52,0
that it was the Lord that had spared

19
00:16:52,0 --> 00:16:52,0
them, and granted unto them a chance for

20
00:16:52,0 --> 00:16:52,0
repentance. And behold they did harden

21
00:16:52,0 --> 00:19:48,
their hearts against the Lord their God.

22
00:19:48,0 --> 00:19:48,0
4 And it came to pass that after

23
00:19:48,0 --> 00:19:48,0
this tenth year had passed away,

24
00:19:48,0 --> 00:19:48,0
making, in the whole, three hundred and

25
00:19:48,0 --> 00:19:48,0
sixty years from the coming of

26
00:19:48,0 --> 00:19:48,0
Christ, the king of the Lamanites sent

27
00:19:48,0 --> 00:19:48,0
an epistle unto me, which gave

28
00:19:48,0 --> 00:19:48,0
unto me to know that they were

29
00:19:48,0 --> 00:21:00,
preparing to come again to battle against us.

30
00:21:00,0 --> 00:21:00,0
5 And it came to pass that I did

31
00:21:00,0 --> 00:21:00,0
cause my people that they should

32
00:21:00,0 --> 00:21:00,0
gather themselves together at the

33
00:21:00,0 --> 00:21:00,0
land Desolation, to a city which was

34
00:21:00,0 --> 00:21:00,0
in the borders, by the narrow

35
00:21:00,0 --> 00:20:32,
pass which led into the land southward.

36
00:20:32,0 --> 00:20:32,0
6 And there we did place our

37
00:20:32,0 --> 00:20:32,0
armies, that we might stop the armies

38
00:20:32,0 --> 00:20:32,0
of the Lamanites, that they

39
00:20:32,0 --> 00:20:32,0
might not get possession of any of

40
00:20:32,0 --> 00:20:32,0
our lands; therefore we did fortify

41
00:20:32,0 --> 00:22:44,
against them with all our force.

42
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
7 And it came to pass that in

43
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
the three hundred and sixty and

44
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
first year the Lamanites did come

45
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
down to the city of Desolation

46
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
to battle against us; and it came

47
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
to pass that in that year we

48
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
did beat them, insomuch that they

49
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:16,
did return to their own lands again.

50
00:22:16,0 --> 00:22:16,0
8 And in the three hundred and

51
00:22:16,0 --> 00:22:16,0
sixty and second year they did

52
00:22:16,0 --> 00:22:16,0
come down again to battle. And we

53
00:22:16,0 --> 00:22:16,0
did beat them again, and did

54
00:22:16,0 --> 00:22:16,0
slay a great number of them, and

55
00:22:16,0 --> 00:24:28,
their dead were cast into the sea.

56
00:24:28,0 --> 00:24:28,0
9 And now, because of this

57
00:24:28,0 --> 00:24:28,0
great thing which my people,

58
00:24:28,0 --> 00:24:28,0
the Nephites, had done, they

59
00:24:28,0 --> 00:24:28,0
began to boast in their own

60
00:24:28,0 --> 00:24:28,0
strength, and began to swear

61
00:24:28,0 --> 00:24:28,0
before the heavens that they

62
00:24:28,0 --> 00:24:28,0
would avenge themselves of the

63
00:24:28,0 --> 00:24:28,0
blood of their brethren who

64
00:24:28,0 --> 00:26:40,
had been slain by their enemies.

65
00:26:40,0 --> 00:26:40,0
10 And they did swear by the

66
00:26:40,0 --> 00:26:40,0
heavens, and also by the

67
00:26:40,0 --> 00:26:40,0
throne of God, that they would

68
00:26:40,0 --> 00:26:40,0
go up to battle against

69
00:26:40,0 --> 00:26:40,0
their enemies, and would cut

70
00:26:40,0 --> 00:32:51,
them off from the face of the land.

71
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
11 And it came to pass

72
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
that I, Mormon, did

73
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
utterly refuse from this time

74
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
forth to be a commander

75
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
and a leader of this

76
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
people, because of their

77
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,
wickedness and abomination.

78
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
12 Behold, I had led

79
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
them, notwithstanding

80
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
their wickedness I had

81
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
led them many times to

82
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
battle, and had loved

83
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
them, according to

84
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
the love of God which

85
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
was in me, with all my

86
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
heart; and my soul had

87
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
been poured out in

88
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
prayer unto my God all

89
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
the day long for them;

90
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
nevertheless, it was

91
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
without faith, because

92
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,
of the hardness of their hearts.

93
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
13 And thrice have

94
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
I delivered them

95
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
out of the hands

96
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
of their enemies,

97
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
and they have

98
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,
repented not of their sins.

99
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
14 And when they

100
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
had sworn by all

101
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
that had been

102
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
forbidden them by

103
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
our Lord and Savior

104
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
Jesus Christ,

105
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
that they would go

106
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
up unto their

107
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
enemies to battle,

108
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
and avenge

109
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
themselves of the blood

110
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
of their

111
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
brethren, behold the

112
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
voice of the Lord

113
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,
came unto me, saying:

114
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
15 Vengeance is

115
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
mine, and I will

116
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
repay; and

117
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
because this people

118
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
repented not

119
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
after I had

120
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
delivered them, behold,

121
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
they shall be

122
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
cut off from the

123
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,
face of the earth.

124
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
16 And it came

125
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
to pass that I

126
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
utterly refused

127
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
to go up

128
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
against mine

129
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
enemies; and I did

130
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
even as the Lord

131
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
had commanded

132
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
me; and I did

133
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
stand as an idle

134
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
witness to

135
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
manifest unto the

136
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
world the things

137
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
which I saw and

138
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
heard,

139
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
according to the

140
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
manifestations of

141
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
the Spirit which

142
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,
had testified of things to come.

143
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
17 Therefore I

144
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
write unto

145
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
you, Gentiles,

146
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
and also unto

147
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
you, house of

148
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
Israel, when

149
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
the work shall

150
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
commence, that

151
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
ye shall be

152
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
about to prepare

153
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
to return to

154
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
the land of

155
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,
your inheritance;

156
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
18 Yea,

157
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
behold, I write

158
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
unto all the

159
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
ends of the

160
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
earth; yea, unto

161
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
you, twelve

162
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
tribes of

163
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
Israel, who

164
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
shall be judged

165
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
according to

166
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
your works by

167
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
the twelve

168
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
whom Jesus

169
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
chose to be his

170
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
disciples in

171
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,
the land of Jerusalem.

172
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
19 And I

173
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
write also unto

174
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
the remnant

175
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
of this

176
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
people, who

177
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
shall also be

178
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
judged by the

179
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
twelve whom

180
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
Jesus chose

181
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
in this

182
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
land; and they

183
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
shall be

184
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
judged by the

185
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
other twelve

186
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
whom Jesus

187
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
chose in the

188
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,
land of Jerusalem.

189
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
20 And

190
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
these things

191
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
doth the

192
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
Spirit manifest

193
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
unto me;

194
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
therefore I

195
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
write unto

196
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
you all.

197
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
And for this

198
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
cause I

199
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
write unto

200
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
you, that ye

201
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
may know

202
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
that ye must

203
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
all stand

204
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
before the

205
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
judgment-seat

206
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
of Christ,

207
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
yea, every

208
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
soul who

209
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
belongs to

210
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
the whole

211
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
human family

212
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
of Adam;

213
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
and ye must

214
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
stand to be

215
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
judged of

216
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
your works,

217
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,
whether they be good or evil;

218
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
21 And also

219
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
that ye

220
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
may believe

221
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
the gospel

222
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
of Jesus

223
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
Christ, which

224
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
ye shall

225
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
have among

226
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
you; and also

227
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
that the

228
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
Jews, the

229
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
covenant

230
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
people of the

231
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
Lord, shall

232
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
have other

233
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
witness

234
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
besides him

235
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
whom they saw

236
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
and heard,

237
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
that

238
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
Jesus, whom they

239
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
slew, was

240
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
the very

241
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
Christ and

242
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,
the very God.

243

would that

245
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
I could

246
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
persuade all

249
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
earth to

250
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
repent and

251
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
prepare to

252
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0
stand before

253
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,0

254
00:32:51,0 --> 00:32:51,
