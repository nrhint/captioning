00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,667
Chapter 3 Mormon cries repentance unto the

2
00:00:01,667 --> 00:00:03,334
Nephites—They gain a great victory and glory in

3
00:00:03,334 --> 00:00:05,001
their own strength—Mormon refuses to lead them,

4
00:00:05,001 --> 00:00:06,668
and his prayers for them are without

5
00:00:06,668 --> 00:00:08,335
faith—The Book of Mormon invites the twelve tribes of

6
00:00:08,335 --> 00:00:10,377
Israel to believe the gospel. About A.D. 360–62. 

7
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:11,177
1 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did

8
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:11,977
not come to battle again until ten years more

9
00:00:11,977 --> 00:00:12,777
had passed away. And behold, I had employed

10
00:00:12,777 --> 00:00:13,577
my people, the Nephites, in preparing their

11
00:00:13,577 --> 00:00:14,781
lands and their arms against the time of battle.

12
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:18,531
2 And it came to pass that the Lord did say

13
00:00:18,531 --> 00:00:22,281
unto me: Cry unto this people—Repent ye, and

14
00:00:22,281 --> 00:00:26,031
come unto me, and be ye baptized, and build

15
00:00:26,031 --> 00:00:29,062
up again my church, and ye shall be spared.

16
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:30,729
3 And I did cry unto this people, but

17
00:00:30,729 --> 00:00:32,396
it was in vain; and they did not realize

18
00:00:32,396 --> 00:00:34,063
that it was the Lord that had spared

19
00:00:34,063 --> 00:00:35,73
them, and granted unto them a chance for

20
00:00:35,73 --> 00:00:37,397
repentance. And behold they did harden

21
00:00:37,397 --> 00:00:39,406
their hearts against the Lord their God.

22
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:40,156
4 And it came to pass that after

23
00:00:40,156 --> 00:00:40,906
this tenth year had passed away,

24
00:00:40,906 --> 00:00:41,656
making, in the whole, three hundred and

25
00:00:41,656 --> 00:00:42,406
sixty years from the coming of

26
00:00:42,406 --> 00:00:43,156
Christ, the king of the Lamanites sent

27
00:00:43,156 --> 00:00:43,906
an epistle unto me, which gave

28
00:00:43,906 --> 00:00:44,656
unto me to know that they were

29
00:00:44,656 --> 00:00:45,746
preparing to come again to battle against us.

30
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:45,579
5 And it came to pass that I did

31
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:45,412
cause my people that they should

32
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:45,245
gather themselves together at the

33
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:45,078
land Desolation, to a city which was

34
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:44,911
in the borders, by the narrow

35
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:44,811
pass which led into the land southward.

36
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:45,644
6 And there we did place our

37
00:00:45,644 --> 00:00:46,477
armies, that we might stop the armies

38
00:00:46,477 --> 00:00:47,31
of the Lamanites, that they

39
00:00:47,31 --> 00:00:48,143
might not get possession of any of

40
00:00:48,143 --> 00:00:48,976
our lands; therefore we did fortify

41
00:00:48,976 --> 00:00:49,216
against them with all our force.

42
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:49,091
7 And it came to pass that in

43
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:48,966
the three hundred and sixty and

44
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:48,841
first year the Lamanites did come

45
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:48,716
down to the city of Desolation

46
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:48,591
to battle against us; and it came

47
00:00:48,591 --> 00:00:48,466
to pass that in that year we

48
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:48,341
did beat them, insomuch that they

49
00:00:48,341 --> 00:00:48,282
did return to their own lands again.

50
00:00:48,282 --> 00:00:52,949
8 And in the three hundred and

51
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:57,616
sixty and second year they did

52
00:00:57,616 --> 00:01:02,283
come down again to battle. And we

53
00:01:02,283 --> 00:01:06,95
did beat them again, and did

54
00:01:06,95 --> 00:01:11,617
slay a great number of them, and

55
00:01:11,617 --> 00:01:16,576
their dead were cast into the sea.

56
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,798
9 And now, because of this

57
00:01:18,798 --> 00:01:21,02
great thing which my people,

58
00:01:21,02 --> 00:01:23,242
the Nephites, had done, they

59
00:01:23,242 --> 00:01:25,465
began to boast in their own

60
00:01:25,465 --> 00:01:27,686
strength, and began to swear

61
00:01:27,686 --> 00:01:29,909
before the heavens that they

62
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:32,13
would avenge themselves of the

63
00:01:32,13 --> 00:01:34,352
blood of their brethren who

64
00:01:34,352 --> 00:01:36,897
had been slain by their enemies.

65
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:38,064
10 And they did swear by the

66
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:39,231
heavens, and also by the

67
00:01:39,231 --> 00:01:40,398
throne of God, that they would

68
00:01:40,398 --> 00:01:41,565
go up to battle against

69
00:01:41,565 --> 00:01:42,732
their enemies, and would cut

70
00:01:42,732 --> 00:01:43,937
them off from the face of the land.

71
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,651
11 And it came to pass

72
00:01:46,651 --> 00:01:49,365
that I, Mormon, did

73
00:01:49,365 --> 00:01:52,079
utterly refuse from this time

74
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,793
forth to be a commander

75
00:01:54,793 --> 00:01:57,507
and a leader of this

76
00:01:57,507 --> 00:02:00,221
people, because of their

77
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:02,255
wickedness and abomination.

78
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:03,188
12 Behold, I had led

79
00:02:03,188 --> 00:02:04,121
them, notwithstanding

80
00:02:04,121 --> 00:02:05,054
their wickedness I had

81
00:02:05,054 --> 00:02:05,987
led them many times to

82
00:02:05,987 --> 00:02:06,92
battle, and had loved

83
00:02:06,92 --> 00:02:07,853
them, according to

84
00:02:07,853 --> 00:02:08,786
the love of God which

85
00:02:08,786 --> 00:02:09,719
was in me, with all my

86
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:10,652
heart; and my soul had

87
00:02:10,652 --> 00:02:11,585
been poured out in

88
00:02:11,585 --> 00:02:12,518
prayer unto my God all

89
00:02:12,518 --> 00:02:13,451
the day long for them;

90
00:02:13,451 --> 00:02:14,384
nevertheless, it was

91
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,317
without faith, because

92
00:02:15,317 --> 00:02:16,536
of the hardness of their hearts.

93
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:20,203
13 And thrice have

94
00:02:20,203 --> 00:02:23,87
I delivered them

95
00:02:23,87 --> 00:02:27,537
out of the hands

96
00:02:27,537 --> 00:02:31,204
of their enemies,

97
00:02:31,204 --> 00:02:34,871
and they have

98
00:02:34,871 --> 00:02:38,792
repented not of their sins.

99
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:40,192
14 And when they

100
00:02:40,192 --> 00:02:41,592
had sworn by all

101
00:02:41,592 --> 00:02:42,992
that had been

102
00:02:42,992 --> 00:02:44,392
forbidden them by

103
00:02:44,392 --> 00:02:45,792
our Lord and Savior

104
00:02:45,792 --> 00:02:47,192
Jesus Christ,

105
00:02:47,192 --> 00:02:48,592
that they would go

106
00:02:48,592 --> 00:02:49,992
up unto their

107
00:02:49,992 --> 00:02:51,392
enemies to battle,

108
00:02:51,392 --> 00:02:52,792
and avenge

109
00:02:52,792 --> 00:02:54,192
themselves of the blood

110
00:02:54,192 --> 00:02:55,592
of their

111
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:56,992
brethren, behold the

112
00:02:56,992 --> 00:02:58,392
voice of the Lord

113
00:02:58,392 --> 00:02:59,146
came unto me, saying:

114
00:02:59,146 --> 00:02:59,546
15 Vengeance is

115
00:02:59,546 --> 00:02:59,946
mine, and I will

116
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:00,346
repay; and

117
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:00,746
because this people

118
00:03:00,746 --> 00:03:01,146
repented not

119
00:03:01,146 --> 00:03:01,546
after I had

120
00:03:01,546 --> 00:03:01,946
delivered them, behold,

121
00:03:01,946 --> 00:03:02,346
they shall be

122
00:03:02,346 --> 00:03:02,746
cut off from the

123
00:03:02,746 --> 00:03:03,55
face of the earth.

124
00:03:03,55 --> 00:03:05,234
16 And it came

125
00:03:05,234 --> 00:03:06,918
to pass that I

126
00:03:06,918 --> 00:03:08,602
utterly refused

127
00:03:08,602 --> 00:03:10,286
to go up

128
00:03:10,286 --> 00:03:11,97
against mine

129
00:03:11,97 --> 00:03:13,654
enemies; and I did

130
00:03:13,654 --> 00:03:15,338
even as the Lord

131
00:03:15,338 --> 00:03:17,022
had commanded

132
00:03:17,022 --> 00:03:18,706
me; and I did

133
00:03:18,706 --> 00:03:20,39
stand as an idle

134
00:03:20,39 --> 00:03:22,074
witness to

135
00:03:22,074 --> 00:03:23,758
manifest unto the

136
00:03:23,758 --> 00:03:25,442
world the things

137
00:03:25,442 --> 00:03:27,126
which I saw and

138
00:03:27,126 --> 00:03:28,81
heard,

139
00:03:28,81 --> 00:03:30,494
according to the

140
00:03:30,494 --> 00:03:32,178
manifestations of

141
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:33,862
the Spirit which

142
00:03:33,862 --> 00:03:35,916
had testified of things to come.

143
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,685
17 Therefore I

144
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:39,454
write unto

145
00:03:39,454 --> 00:03:41,223
you, Gentiles,

146
00:03:41,223 --> 00:03:42,992
and also unto

147
00:03:42,992 --> 00:03:44,761
you, house of

148
00:03:44,761 --> 00:03:46,53
Israel, when

149
00:03:46,53 --> 00:03:48,299
the work shall

150
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:50,068
commence, that

151
00:03:50,068 --> 00:03:51,837
ye shall be

152
00:03:51,837 --> 00:03:53,606
about to prepare

153
00:03:53,606 --> 00:03:55,375
to return to

154
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:57,144
the land of

155
00:03:57,144 --> 00:03:58,205
your inheritance;

156
00:03:58,205 --> 00:03:58,143
18 Yea,

157
00:03:58,143 --> 00:03:58,081
behold, I write

158
00:03:58,081 --> 00:03:58,019
unto all the

159
00:03:58,019 --> 00:03:57,957
ends of the

160
00:03:57,957 --> 00:03:57,895
earth; yea, unto

161
00:03:57,895 --> 00:03:57,833
you, twelve

162
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:57,771
tribes of

163
00:03:57,771 --> 00:03:57,709
Israel, who

164
00:03:57,709 --> 00:03:57,647
shall be judged

165
00:03:57,647 --> 00:03:57,585
according to

166
00:03:57,585 --> 00:03:57,523
your works by

167
00:03:57,523 --> 00:03:57,461
the twelve

168
00:03:57,461 --> 00:03:57,399
whom Jesus

169
00:03:57,399 --> 00:03:57,337
chose to be his

170
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:57,275
disciples in

171
00:03:57,275 --> 00:03:57,27
the land of Jerusalem.

172
00:03:57,27 --> 00:03:57,682
19 And I

173
00:03:57,682 --> 00:03:58,094
write also unto

174
00:03:58,094 --> 00:03:58,506
the remnant

175
00:03:58,506 --> 00:03:58,918
of this

176
00:03:58,918 --> 00:03:59,33
people, who

177
00:03:59,33 --> 00:03:59,742
shall also be

178
00:03:59,742 --> 00:04:00,154
judged by the

179
00:04:00,154 --> 00:04:00,566
twelve whom

180
00:04:00,566 --> 00:04:00,978
Jesus chose

181
00:04:00,978 --> 00:04:01,39
in this

182
00:04:01,39 --> 00:04:01,802
land; and they

183
00:04:01,802 --> 00:04:02,214
shall be

184
00:04:02,214 --> 00:04:02,626
judged by the

185
00:04:02,626 --> 00:04:03,038
other twelve

186
00:04:03,038 --> 00:04:03,45
whom Jesus

187
00:04:03,45 --> 00:04:03,862
chose in the

188
00:04:03,862 --> 00:04:04,311
land of Jerusalem.

189
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:05,07
20 And

190
00:04:05,07 --> 00:04:05,829
these things

191
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:06,588
doth the

192
00:04:06,588 --> 00:04:07,347
Spirit manifest

193
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:08,106
unto me;

194
00:04:08,106 --> 00:04:08,865
therefore I

195
00:04:08,865 --> 00:04:09,624
write unto

196
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:10,383
you all.

197
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:11,142
And for this

198
00:04:11,142 --> 00:04:11,901

202
00:04:14,178 --> 00:04:14,937
that ye must

203
00:04:14,937 --> 00:04:15,696

204
00:04:15,696 --> 00:04:16,455

205
00:04:16,455 --> 00:04:17,214

206
00:04:17,214 --> 00:04:17,973
of Christ,

207
00:04:17,973 --> 00:04:18,732
yea, every

208
00:04:18,732 --> 00:04:19,491
soul who

209
00:04:19,491 --> 00:04:20,25
belongs to

210
00:04:20,25 --> 00:04:21,009
the whole

211
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:21,768
human family

212
00:04:21,768 --> 00:04:22,527

215
00:04:24,045 --> 00:04:24,804
judged of

216
00:04:24,804 --> 00:04:25,563
your works,

217
00:04:25,563 --> 00:04:26,566
whether they be good or evil;

218
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:27,046
21 And also

219
00:04:27,046 --> 00:04:27,526

220
00:04:27,526 --> 00:04:28,006

221
00:04:28,006 --> 00:04:28,486
the gospel

222
00:04:28,486 --> 00:04:28,966
of Jesus

223
00:04:28,966 --> 00:04:29,446
Christ, which

224
00:04:29,446 --> 00:04:29,926
ye shall

225
00:04:29,926 --> 00:04:30,406
have among

226
00:04:30,406 --> 00:04:30,886
you; and also

227
00:04:30,886 --> 00:04:31,366

228
00:04:31,366 --> 00:04:31,846
Jews, the

229
00:04:31,846 --> 00:04:32,326
covenant

230
00:04:32,326 --> 00:04:32,806
people of the

231
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:33,286
Lord, shall

232
00:04:33,286 --> 00:04:33,766
have other

233
00:04:33,766 --> 00:04:34,246
witness

234
00:04:34,246 --> 00:04:34,726
besides him

235
00:04:34,726 --> 00:04:35,206
whom they saw

236
00:04:35,206 --> 00:04:35,686
and heard,

237
00:04:35,686 --> 00:04:36,166
that

238
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:36,646
Jesus, whom they

239
00:04:36,646 --> 00:04:37,126
slew, was

240
00:04:37,126 --> 00:04:37,606
the very

241
00:04:37,606 --> 00:04:38,086
Christ and

242
00:04:38,086 --> 00:04:38,912
the very God.

243
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:40,745
22 And I

244
00:04:40,745 --> 00:04:42,578

00:04:44,411 --> 00:04:46,244
persuade all

247
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:48,077
ye ends

248
00:04:48,077 --> 00:04:49,91
of the

249
00:04:49,91 --> 00:04:51,743
earth to

250
00:04:51,743 --> 00:04:53,576
repent and

251
00:04:53,576 --> 00:04:55,409
prepare to

252
00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:57,242
stand before

254
00:04:59,075 --> 00:05:00,734
