00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
The Book of MormonChapter 1 Ammaron instructs

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Mormon concerning the sacred records—War commences

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
between the Nephites and the Lamanites—The Three

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Nephites are taken away—Wickedness, unbelief,

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:22:07,
sorceries, and witchcraft prevail. About A.D. 321–26. 

6
00:22:07,0 --> 00:22:07,0
1 And now I, Mormon, make a record of

7
00:22:07,0 --> 00:22:07,0
the things which I have both seen and

8
00:22:07,0 --> 00:21:39,
heard, and call it the Book of Mormon.

9
00:21:39,0 --> 00:21:39,0
2 And about the time that Ammaron

10
00:21:39,0 --> 00:21:39,0
hid up the records unto the Lord, he

11
00:21:39,0 --> 00:21:39,0
came unto me, (I being about ten

12
00:21:39,0 --> 00:21:39,0
years of age, and I began to be learned

13
00:21:39,0 --> 00:21:39,0
somewhat after the manner of the

14
00:21:39,0 --> 00:21:39,0
learning of my people) and Ammaron said

15
00:21:39,0 --> 00:21:39,0
unto me: I perceive that thou art a

16
00:21:39,0 --> 00:22:51,
sober child, and art quick to observe;

17
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
3 Therefore, when ye are about

18
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
twenty and four years old I would

19
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
that ye should remember the

20
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
things that ye have observed

21
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
concerning this people; and when ye

22
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
are of that age go to the land

23
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
Antum, unto a hill which shall be

24
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
called Shim; and there have I

25
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
deposited unto the Lord all the

26
00:22:51,0 --> 00:25:33,
sacred engravings concerning this people.

27
00:25:33,0 --> 00:25:33,0
4 And behold, ye shall take

28
00:25:33,0 --> 00:25:33,0
the plates of Nephi unto

29
00:25:33,0 --> 00:25:33,0
yourself, and the remainder

30
00:25:33,0 --> 00:25:33,0
shall ye leave in the place

31
00:25:33,0 --> 00:25:33,0
where they are; and ye shall

32
00:25:33,0 --> 00:25:33,0
engrave on the plates of Nephi

33
00:25:33,0 --> 00:25:33,0
all the things that ye have

34
00:25:33,0 --> 00:30:43,
observed concerning this people.

35
00:30:43,0 --> 00:30:43,0
5 And I, Mormon, being a

36
00:30:43,0 --> 00:30:43,0
descendant of Nephi, (and

37
00:30:43,0 --> 00:30:43,0
my father’s name was

38
00:30:43,0 --> 00:30:43,0
Mormon) I remembered the things

39
00:30:43,0 --> 00:34:56,
which Ammaron commanded me.

40
00:34:56,0 --> 00:34:56,0
6 And it came to pass

41
00:34:56,0 --> 00:34:56,0
that I, being eleven

42
00:34:56,0 --> 00:34:56,0
years old, was carried

43
00:34:56,0 --> 00:34:56,0
by my father into the

44
00:34:56,0 --> 00:34:56,0
land southward, even

45
00:34:56,0 --> 00:41:51,
to the land of Zarahemla.

46
00:41:51,0 --> 00:41:51,0
7 The whole face of

47
00:41:51,0 --> 00:41:51,0
the land had

48
00:41:51,0 --> 00:41:51,0
become covered with

49
00:41:51,0 --> 00:41:51,0
buildings, and the

50
00:41:51,0 --> 00:41:51,0
people were as numerous

51
00:41:51,0 --> 00:41:51,0
almost, as it were

52
00:41:51,0 --> 00:45:01,
the sand of the sea.

53
00:45:01,0 --> 00:45:01,0
8 And it came to

54
00:45:01,0 --> 00:45:01,0
pass in this year

55
00:45:01,0 --> 00:45:01,0
there began to be a

56
00:45:01,0 --> 00:45:01,0
war between the

57
00:45:01,0 --> 00:45:01,0
Nephites, who

58
00:45:01,0 --> 00:45:01,0
consisted of the

59
00:45:01,0 --> 00:45:01,0
Nephites and the

60
00:45:01,0 --> 00:45:01,0
Jacobites and the

61
00:45:01,0 --> 00:45:01,0
Josephites and the

62
00:45:01,0 --> 00:45:01,0
Zoramites; and this war

63
00:45:01,0 --> 00:45:01,0
was between the

64
00:45:01,0 --> 00:45:01,0
Nephites, and the

65
00:45:01,0 --> 00:45:01,0
Lamanites and the

66
00:45:01,0 --> 00:47:43,
Lemuelites and the Ishmaelites.

67
00:47:43,0 --> 00:47:43,0
9 Now the

68
00:47:43,0 --> 00:47:43,0
Lamanites and the

69
00:47:43,0 --> 00:47:43,0
Lemuelites and the

70
00:47:43,0 --> 00:47:43,0
Ishmaelites were

71
00:47:43,0 --> 00:47:43,0
called

72
00:47:43,0 --> 00:47:43,0
Lamanites, and the two

73
00:47:43,0 --> 00:47:43,0
parties were

74
00:47:43,0 --> 00:51:14,
Nephites and Lamanites.

75
00:51:14,0 --> 00:51:14,0
10 And it came

76
00:51:14,0 --> 00:51:14,0
to pass that

77
00:51:14,0 --> 00:51:14,0
the war began to

78
00:51:14,0 --> 00:51:14,0
be among them

79
00:51:14,0 --> 00:51:14,0
in the borders

80
00:51:14,0 --> 00:51:14,0
of Zarahemla, by

81
00:51:14,0 --> 01:00:23,
the waters of Sidon.

82
01:00:23,0 --> 01:00:23,0
11 And it came

83
01:00:23,0 --> 01:00:23,0
to pass that

84
01:00:23,0 --> 01:00:23,0
the Nephites

85
01:00:23,0 --> 01:00:23,0
had gathered

86
01:00:23,0 --> 01:00:23,0
together a great

87
01:00:23,0 --> 01:00:23,0
number of

88
01:00:23,0 --> 01:00:23,0
men, even to

89
01:00:23,0 --> 01:00:23,0
exceed the number

90
01:00:23,0 --> 01:00:23,0
of thirty

91
01:00:23,0 --> 01:00:23,0
thousand. And it

92
01:00:23,0 --> 01:00:23,0
came to pass

93
01:00:23,0 --> 01:00:23,0
that they did

94
01:00:23,0 --> 01:00:23,0
have in this

95
01:00:23,0 --> 01:00:23,0
same year a

96
01:00:23,0 --> 01:00:23,0
number of battles,

97
01:00:23,0 --> 01:00:23,0
in which the

98
01:00:23,0 --> 01:00:23,0
Nephites did

99
01:00:23,0 --> 01:00:23,0
beat the

100
01:00:23,0 --> 01:01:21,
Lamanites and did slay many of them.

101
01:01:21,0 --> 01:01:21,0
12 And it

102
01:01:21,0 --> 01:01:21,0
came to pass

103
01:01:21,0 --> 01:01:21,0
that the

104
01:01:21,0 --> 01:01:21,0
Lamanites withdrew

105
01:01:21,0 --> 01:01:21,0
their design,

106
01:01:21,0 --> 01:01:21,0
and there was

107
01:01:21,0 --> 01:01:21,0
peace

108
01:01:21,0 --> 01:01:21,0
settled in the

109
01:01:21,0 --> 01:01:21,0
land; and peace

110
01:01:21,0 --> 01:01:21,0
did remain for

111
01:01:21,0 --> 01:01:21,0
the space of

112
01:01:21,0 --> 01:01:21,0
about four

113
01:01:21,0 --> 01:01:21,0
years, that

114
01:01:21,0 --> 01:05:34,
there was no bloodshed.

115
01:05:34,0 --> 01:05:34,0
13 But

116
01:05:34,0 --> 01:05:34,0
wickedness did

117
01:05:34,0 --> 01:05:34,0
prevail upon

118
01:05:34,0 --> 01:05:34,0
the face of

119
01:05:34,0 --> 01:05:34,0
the whole

120
01:05:34,0 --> 01:05:34,0
land, insomuch

121
01:05:34,0 --> 01:05:34,0
that the

122
01:05:34,0 --> 01:05:34,0
Lord did take

123
01:05:34,0 --> 01:05:34,0
away his

124
01:05:34,0 --> 01:05:34,0
beloved

125
01:05:34,0 --> 01:05:34,0
disciples, and the

126
01:05:34,0 --> 01:05:34,0
work of

127
01:05:34,0 --> 01:05:34,0
miracles and of

128
01:05:34,0 --> 01:05:34,0
healing did

129
01:05:34,0 --> 01:05:34,0
cease because

130
01:05:34,0 --> 01:05:34,0
of the

131
01:05:34,0 --> 01:07:46,
iniquity of the people.

132
01:07:46,0 --> 01:07:46,0
14 And

133
01:07:46,0 --> 01:07:46,0
there were no

134
01:07:46,0 --> 01:07:46,0
gifts from

135
01:07:46,0 --> 01:07:46,0
the Lord,

136
01:07:46,0 --> 01:07:46,0
and the Holy

137
01:07:46,0 --> 01:07:46,0
Ghost did

138
01:07:46,0 --> 01:07:46,0
not come

139
01:07:46,0 --> 01:07:46,0
upon any,

140
01:07:46,0 --> 01:07:46,0
because of

141
01:07:46,0 --> 01:07:46,0
their

142
01:07:46,0 --> 01:09:44,
wickedness and unbelief.

143
01:09:44,0 --> 01:09:44,0
15 And I,

144
01:09:44,0 --> 01:09:44,0
being

145
01:09:44,0 --> 01:09:44,0
fifteen years

146
01:09:44,0 --> 01:09:44,0
of age and

147
01:09:44,0 --> 01:09:44,0
being

148
01:09:44,0 --> 01:09:44,0
somewhat of a

149
01:09:44,0 --> 01:09:44,0
sober

150
01:09:44,0 --> 01:09:44,0
mind,

151
01:09:44,0 --> 01:09:44,0
therefore I was

152
01:09:44,0 --> 01:09:44,0
visited of

153
01:09:44,0 --> 01:09:44,0
the Lord,

154
01:09:44,0 --> 01:09:44,0
and tasted

155
01:09:44,0 --> 01:09:44,0
and knew

156
01:09:44,0 --> 01:09:44,0
of the

157
01:09:44,0 --> 01:13:28,
goodness of Jesus.

158
01:13:28,0 --> 01:13:28,0
16 And I

159
01:13:28,0 --> 01:13:28,0
did

160
01:13:28,0 --> 01:13:28,0
endeavor to

161
01:13:28,0 --> 01:13:28,0
preach unto

162
01:13:28,0 --> 01:13:28,0
this

163
01:13:28,0 --> 01:13:28,0
people, but

164
01:13:28,0 --> 01:13:28,0
my mouth

165
01:13:28,0 --> 01:13:28,0
was shut,

166
01:13:28,0 --> 01:13:28,0
and I

167
01:13:28,0 --> 01:13:28,0
was

168
01:13:28,0 --> 01:13:28,0
forbidden that I

169
01:13:28,0 --> 01:13:28,0
should

170
01:13:28,0 --> 01:13:28,0
preach

171
01:13:28,0 --> 01:13:28,0
unto them;

172
01:13:28,0 --> 01:13:28,0
for behold

173
01:13:28,0 --> 01:13:28,0
they had

174
01:13:28,0 --> 01:13:28,0
wilfully

175
01:13:28,0 --> 01:13:28,0
rebelled

176
01:13:28,0 --> 01:13:28,0
against

177
01:13:28,0 --> 01:13:28,0
their

178
01:13:28,0 --> 01:13:28,0
God; and the

179
01:13:28,0 --> 01:13:28,0
beloved

180
01:13:28,0 --> 01:13:28,0
disciples

181
01:13:28,0 --> 01:13:28,0
were

182
01:13:28,0 --> 01:13:28,0
taken away

183
01:13:28,0 --> 01:13:28,0
out of the

184
01:13:28,0 --> 01:15:40,
land, because of their iniquity.

185
01:15:40,0 --> 01:15:40,0
17 But I

186
01:15:40,0 --> 01:15:40,0
did

187
01:15:40,0 --> 01:15:40,0
remain

188
01:15:40,0 --> 01:15:40,0
among them,

189
01:15:40,0 --> 01:15:40,0
but I

190
01:15:40,0 --> 01:15:40,0
was

191
01:15:40,0 --> 01:15:40,0
forbidden to

192
01:15:40,0 --> 01:15:40,0
preach

193
01:15:40,0 --> 01:15:40,0
unto them,

194
01:15:40,0 --> 01:15:40,0
because

195
01:15:40,0 --> 01:15:40,0
of the

196
01:15:40,0 --> 01:15:40,0
hardness

197
01:15:40,0 --> 01:15:40,0
of

198
01:15:40,0 --> 01:15:40,0
their

199
01:15:40,0 --> 01:15:40,0
hearts; and

200
01:15:40,0 --> 01:15:40,0
because of

201
01:15:40,0 --> 01:15:40,0
the

202
01:15:40,0 --> 01:15:40,0
hardness of

203
01:15:40,0 --> 01:15:40,0
their

204
01:15:40,0 --> 01:15:40,0
hearts

205
01:15:40,0 --> 01:15:40,0
the land

206
01:15:40,0 --> 01:21:51,
was cursed for their sake.

207
01:21:51,0 --> 01:21:51,0
18 And

208
01:21:51,0 --> 01:21:51,0
these

209
01:21:51,0 --> 01:21:51,0


210
01:21:51,0 --> 01:21:51,0
Gadianton

211
01:21:51,0 --> 01:21:51,0
robbers, who

212
01:21:51,0 --> 01:21:51,0
were

213
01:21:51,0 --> 01:21:51,0
among

214
01:21:51,0 --> 01:21:51,0
the

215
01:21:51,0 --> 01:21:51,0
Lamanites,

216
01:21:51,0 --> 01:21:51,0
did

217
01:21:51,0 --> 01:21:51,0
infest the

218
01:21:51,0 --> 01:21:51,0
land,

219
01:21:51,0 --> 01:21:51,0
insomuch

220
01:21:51,0 --> 01:21:51,0
that

221
01:21:51,0 --> 01:21:51,0
the

222
01:21:51,0 --> 01:21:51,0
inhabitants

223
01:21:51,0 --> 01:21:51,0


224
01:21:51,0 --> 01:21:51,0
thereof began

225
01:21:51,0 --> 01:21:51,0
to

226
01:21:51,0 --> 01:21:51,0
hide up

227
01:21:51,0 --> 01:21:51,0
their

228
01:21:51,0 --> 01:21:51,0
treasures

229
01:21:51,0 --> 01:21:51,0
in the

230
01:21:51,0 --> 01:21:51,0
earth;

231
01:21:51,0 --> 01:21:51,0
and

232
01:21:51,0 --> 01:21:51,0
they

233
01:21:51,0 --> 01:21:51,0
became

234
01:21:51,0 --> 01:21:51,0
slippery,

235
01:21:51,0 --> 01:21:51,0
because

236
01:21:51,0 --> 01:21:51,0
the Lord

237
01:21:51,0 --> 01:21:51,0
had

238
01:21:51,0 --> 01:21:51,0
cursed

239
01:21:51,0 --> 01:21:51,0
the land,

240
01:21:51,0 --> 01:21:51,0
that

241
01:21:51,0 --> 01:21:51,0
they

242
01:21:51,0 --> 01:22:35,
could not hold them, nor retain them again.

243
01:22:35,0 --> 01:22:35,0
19 And

244
01:22:35,0 --> 01:22:35,0
it

245
01:22:35,0 --> 01:22:35,0
came to

246
01:22:35,0 --> 01:22:35,0
pass

247
01:22:35,0 --> 01:22:35,0
that

248
01:22:35,0 --> 01:22:35,0
there

249
01:22:35,0 --> 01:22:35,0
were

250
01:22:35,0 --> 01:22:35,0


251
01:22:35,0 --> 01:22:35,0
sorceries, and

252
01:22:35,0 --> 01:22:35,0


253
01:22:35,0 --> 01:22:35,0
witchcrafts,

254
01:22:35,0 --> 01:22:35,0
and

255
01:22:35,0 --> 01:22:35,0
magics;

256
01:22:35,0 --> 01:22:35,0
and

257
01:22:35,0 --> 01:22:35,0
the

258
01:22:35,0 --> 01:22:35,0
power of

259
01:22:35,0 --> 01:22:35,0
the

260
01:22:35,0 --> 01:22:35,0
evil one

261
01:22:35,0 --> 01:22:35,0
was

262
01:22:35,0 --> 01:22:35,0
wrought

263
01:22:35,0 --> 01:22:35,0
upon

264
01:22:35,0 --> 01:22:35,0
all

265
01:22:35,0 --> 01:22:35,0
the face

266
01:22:35,0 --> 01:22:35,0
of

267
01:22:35,0 --> 01:22:35,0
the

268
01:22:35,0 --> 01:22:35,0
land, even

269
01:22:35,0 --> 01:22:35,0
unto

270
01:22:35,0 --> 01:22:35,0
the

271
01:22:35,0 --> 01:22:35,0


272
01:22:35,0 --> 01:22:35,0
fulfilling of

273
01:22:35,0 --> 01:22:35,0
all

274
01:22:35,0 --> 01:22:35,0
the

275
01:22:35,0 --> 01:22:35,0
words of

276
01:22:35,0 --> 01:26:05,
Abinadi, and also Samuel the Lamanite.
