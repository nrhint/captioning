1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,4
The Book of MormonChapter 1 Ammaron instructs

2
00:00:01,4 --> 00:00:02,8
 Mormon concerning the sacred records—War commences

3
00:00:02,8 --> 00:00:04,2
 between the Nephites and the Lamanites—The Three

4
00:00:04,2 --> 00:00:05,6
 Nephites are taken away—Wickedness, unbelief,

5
00:00:05,6 --> 00:00:07,0
 sorceries, and witchcraft prevail. About A.D. 321–26.

6
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:10,642
1 And now I, Mormon, make a record of the things

7
00:00:10,642 --> 00:00:13,309
 which I have both seen and heard, and call it the

8
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:15,976
 Book of Mormon

9
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,282
2 And about the time that Ammaron hid up the

10
00:00:17,282 --> 00:00:18,615
 records unto the Lord, he came unto me, (I being about

11
00:00:18,615 --> 00:00:19,948
 ten years of age, and I began to be learned

12
00:00:19,948 --> 00:00:21,281
 somewhat after the manner of the learning of my people)

13
00:00:21,281 --> 00:00:22,614
 and Ammaron said unto me: I perceive that thou art

14
00:00:22,614 --> 00:00:23,947
 a sober child, and art quick to observe

15
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:26,21
3 Therefore, when ye are about twenty and four

16
00:00:26,21 --> 00:00:28,496
 years old I would that ye should remember the things

17
00:00:28,496 --> 00:00:30,782
 that ye have observed concerning this people; and

18
00:00:30,782 --> 00:00:33,068
 when ye are of that age go to the land Antum, unto

19
00:00:33,068 --> 00:00:35,354
 a hill which shall be called Shim; and there have

20
00:00:35,354 --> 00:00:37,64
 I deposited unto the Lord all the sacred

21
00:00:37,64 --> 00:00:39,926
 engravings concerning this people

22
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,473
4 And behold, ye shall take the plates of Nephi

23
00:00:41,473 --> 00:00:43,073
 unto yourself, and the remainder shall ye leave in

24
00:00:43,073 --> 00:00:44,673
 the place where they are; and ye shall engrave on

25
00:00:44,673 --> 00:00:46,273
 the plates of Nephi all the things that ye have

26
00:00:46,273 --> 00:00:47,873
 observed concerning this people

27
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:50,515
5 And I, Mormon, being a descendant of Nephi, (and

28
00:00:50,515 --> 00:00:53,182
 my father’s name was Mormon) I remembered the

29
00:00:53,182 --> 00:00:55,849
 things which Ammaron commanded me

30
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:58,489
6 And it came to pass that I, being eleven years

31
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:01,156
 old, was carried by my father into the land

32
00:01:01,156 --> 00:01:03,823
 southward, even to the land of Zarahemla

33
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:09,13
7 The whole face of the land had become covered

34
00:01:09,13 --> 00:01:14,463
 with buildings, and the people were as numerous

35
00:01:14,463 --> 00:01:19,796
 almost, as it were the sand of the sea

36
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,079
8 And it came to pass in this year there began to

37
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:22,412
 be a war between the Nephites, who consisted of

38
00:01:22,412 --> 00:01:23,745
 the Nephites and the Jacobites and the Josephites

39
00:01:23,745 --> 00:01:25,078
 and the Zoramites; and this war was between the

40
00:01:25,078 --> 00:01:26,411
 Nephites, and the Lamanites and the Lemuelites and the

41
00:01:26,411 --> 00:01:27,744
 Ishmaelites

42
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:30,388
9 Now the Lamanites and the Lemuelites and the

43
00:01:30,388 --> 00:01:33,055
 Ishmaelites were called Lamanites, and the two

44
00:01:33,055 --> 00:01:35,722
 parties were Nephites and Lamanites

45
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:38,363
10 And it came to pass that the war began to be

46
00:01:38,363 --> 00:01:41,03
 among them in the borders of Zarahemla, by the

47
00:01:41,03 --> 00:01:43,697
 waters of Sidon

48
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:45,003
11 And it came to pass that the Nephites had

49
00:01:45,003 --> 00:01:46,336
 gathered together a great number of men, even to exceed

50
00:01:46,336 --> 00:01:47,669
 the number of thirty thousand. And it came to

51
00:01:47,669 --> 00:01:49,002
 pass that they did have in this same year a number of

52
00:01:49,002 --> 00:01:50,335
 battles, in which the Nephites did beat the

53
00:01:50,335 --> 00:01:51,668
 Lamanites and did slay many of them

54
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:53,645
12 And it came to pass that the Lamanites withdrew

55
00:01:53,645 --> 00:01:55,645
 their design, and there was peace settled in the

56
00:01:55,645 --> 00:01:57,645
 land; and peace did remain for the space of about

57
00:01:57,645 --> 00:01:59,645
 four years, that there was no bloodshed

58
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:01,219
13 But wickedness did prevail upon the face of the

59
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:02,82
 whole land, insomuch that the Lord did take away

60
00:02:02,82 --> 00:02:04,419
 his beloved disciples, and the work of miracles

61
00:02:04,419 --> 00:02:06,02
 and of healing did cease because of the iniquity of

62
00:02:06,02 --> 00:02:07,62
 the people

63
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:10,261
14 And there were no gifts from the Lord, and the

64
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:12,928
 Holy Ghost did not come upon any, because of their

65
00:02:12,928 --> 00:02:15,595
 wickedness and unbelief

66
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:19,569
15 And I, being fifteen years of age and being

67
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:23,569
 somewhat of a sober mind, therefore I was visited of

68
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:27,569
 the Lord, and tasted and knew of the goodness of

69
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:31,569
 Jesus

70
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:32,851
16 And I did endeavor to preach unto this people,

71
00:02:32,851 --> 00:02:34,184
 but my mouth was shut, and I was forbidden that I

72
00:02:34,184 --> 00:02:35,517
 should preach unto them; for behold they had

73
00:02:35,517 --> 00:02:36,85
 wilfully rebelled against their God; and the beloved

74
00:02:36,85 --> 00:02:38,183
 disciples were taken away out of the land, because

75
00:02:38,183 --> 00:02:39,516
 of their iniquity

76
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,493
17 But I did remain among them, but I was

77
00:02:41,493 --> 00:02:43,493
 forbidden to preach unto them, because of the hardness of

78
00:02:43,493 --> 00:02:45,493
 their hearts; and because of the hardness of their

79
00:02:45,493 --> 00:02:47,493
 hearts the land was cursed for their sake

80
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:48,8
18 And these Gadianton robbers, who were among the

81
00:02:48,8 --> 00:02:50,133
 Lamanites, did infest the land, insomuch that the

82
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:51,466
 inhabitants thereof began to hide up their

83
00:02:51,466 --> 00:02:52,799
 treasures in the earth; and they became slippery,

84
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:54,132
 because the Lord had cursed the land, that they could

85
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,465
 not hold them, nor retain them again

86
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:57,042
19 And it came to pass that there were sorceries,

87
00:02:57,042 --> 00:02:58,642
 and witchcrafts, and magics; and the power of the

88
00:02:58,642 --> 00:03:00,242
 evil one was wrought upon all the face of the

89
00:03:00,242 --> 00:03:01,842
 land, even unto the fulfilling of all the words of

90
00:03:01,842 --> 00:03:03,442
 Abinadi, and also Samuel the Lamanite.
