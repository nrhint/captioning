1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:08,8
The Book of MormonChapter 1 Ammaron instructs

2
00:00:08,8 --> 00:00:17,6
Mormon concerning the sacred records—War commences

3
00:00:17,6 --> 00:00:26,4
between the Nephites and the Lamanites—The Three

4
00:00:26,4 --> 00:00:35,2
Nephites are taken away—Wickedness, unbelief,

5
00:00:35,2 --> 00:00:44,278
sorceries, and witchcraft prevail. About A.D. 321–26. 

6
00:00:44,278 --> 00:00:48,945
1 And now I, Mormon, make a record of

7
00:00:48,945 --> 00:00:53,612
the things which I have both seen and

8
00:00:53,612 --> 00:00:58,559
heard, and call it the Book of Mormon.

9
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,309
2 And about the time that Ammaron

10
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,059
hid up the records unto the Lord, he

11
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:00,809
came unto me, (I being about ten

12
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:01,559
years of age, and I began to be learned

13
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:02,309
somewhat after the manner of the

14
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:03,059
learning of my people) and Ammaron said

15
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:03,809
unto me: I perceive that thou art a

16
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:04,431
sober child, and art quick to observe;

17
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:08,131
3 Therefore, when ye are about

18
00:01:08,131 --> 00:01:11,831
twenty and four years old I would

19
00:01:11,831 --> 00:01:15,531
that ye should remember the

20
00:01:15,531 --> 00:01:19,231
things that ye have observed

21
00:01:19,231 --> 00:01:22,931
concerning this people; and when ye

22
00:01:22,931 --> 00:01:26,631
are of that age go to the land

23
00:01:26,631 --> 00:01:30,331
Antum, unto a hill which shall be

24
00:01:30,331 --> 00:01:34,031
called Shim; and there have I

25
00:01:34,031 --> 00:01:37,731
deposited unto the Lord all the

26
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:41,735
sacred engravings concerning this people.

27
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:41,86
4 And behold, ye shall take

28
00:01:41,86 --> 00:01:41,985
the plates of Nephi unto

29
00:01:41,985 --> 00:01:42,11
yourself, and the remainder

30
00:01:42,11 --> 00:01:42,235
shall ye leave in the place

31
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:42,36
where they are; and ye shall

32
00:01:42,36 --> 00:01:42,485
engrave on the plates of Nephi

33
00:01:42,485 --> 00:01:42,61
all the things that ye have

34
00:01:42,61 --> 00:01:42,202
observed concerning this people.

35
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:42,002
5 And I, Mormon, being a

36
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:41,802
descendant of Nephi, (and

37
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:41,602
my father’s name was

38
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:41,402
Mormon) I remembered the things

39
00:01:41,402 --> 00:01:41,268
which Ammaron commanded me.

40
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:50,268
6 And it came to pass

41
00:01:50,268 --> 00:01:59,268
that I, being eleven

42
00:01:59,268 --> 00:02:08,268
years old, was carried

43
00:02:08,268 --> 00:02:17,268
by my father into the

44
00:02:17,268 --> 00:02:26,268
land southward, even

45
00:02:26,268 --> 00:02:35,422
to the land of Zarahemla.

46
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:36,708
7 The whole face of

47
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:37,994
the land had

48
00:02:37,994 --> 00:02:39,28
become covered with

49
00:02:39,28 --> 00:02:40,566
buildings, and the

50
00:02:40,566 --> 00:02:41,852
people were as numerous

51
00:02:41,852 --> 00:02:43,138
almost, as it were

52
00:02:43,138 --> 00:02:44,865
the sand of the sea.

53
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:46,222
8 And it came to

54
00:02:46,222 --> 00:02:47,579
pass in this year

55
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:48,936
there began to be a

56
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:50,293
war between the

57
00:02:50,293 --> 00:02:51,65
Nephites, who

58
00:02:51,65 --> 00:02:53,007
consisted of the

59
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:54,364
Nephites and the

60
00:02:54,364 --> 00:02:55,721
Jacobites and the

61
00:02:55,721 --> 00:02:57,078
Josephites and the

62
00:02:57,078 --> 00:02:58,435
Zoramites; and this war

63
00:02:58,435 --> 00:02:59,792
was between the

64
00:02:59,792 --> 00:03:01,149
Nephites, and the

65
00:03:01,149 --> 00:03:02,506
Lamanites and the

66
00:03:02,506 --> 00:03:03,216
Lemuelites and the Ishmaelites.

67
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:03,841
9 Now the

68
00:03:03,841 --> 00:03:04,466
Lamanites and the

69
00:03:04,466 --> 00:03:05,091
Lemuelites and the

70
00:03:05,091 --> 00:03:05,716
Ishmaelites were

71
00:03:05,716 --> 00:03:06,341
called

72
00:03:06,341 --> 00:03:06,966
Lamanites, and the two

73
00:03:06,966 --> 00:03:07,591
parties were

74
00:03:07,591 --> 00:03:08,622
Nephites and Lamanites.

75
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:09,765
10 And it came

76
00:03:09,765 --> 00:03:10,908
to pass that

77
00:03:10,908 --> 00:03:12,051
the war began to

78
00:03:12,051 --> 00:03:13,194
be among them

79
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:14,337
in the borders

80
00:03:14,337 --> 00:03:15,48
of Zarahemla, by

81
00:03:15,48 --> 00:03:16,129
the waters of Sidon.

82
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:17,287
11 And it came

83
00:03:17,287 --> 00:03:18,445
to pass that

84
00:03:18,445 --> 00:03:19,603
the Nephites

85
00:03:19,603 --> 00:03:20,761
had gathered

86
00:03:20,761 --> 00:03:21,919
together a great

87
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:23,077
number of

88
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,235
men, even to

89
00:03:24,235 --> 00:03:25,393
exceed the number

90
00:03:25,393 --> 00:03:26,551
of thirty

91
00:03:26,551 --> 00:03:27,709
thousand. And it

92
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:28,867
came to pass

93
00:03:28,867 --> 00:03:30,025
that they did

94
00:03:30,025 --> 00:03:31,183
have in this

95
00:03:31,183 --> 00:03:32,341
same year a

96
00:03:32,341 --> 00:03:33,499
number of battles,

97
00:03:33,499 --> 00:03:34,657
in which the

98
00:03:34,657 --> 00:03:35,815
Nephites did

99
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:36,973
beat the

100
00:03:36,973 --> 00:03:38,385
Lamanites and did slay many of them.

101
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:41,956
12 And it

102
00:03:41,956 --> 00:03:45,527
came to pass

103
00:03:45,527 --> 00:03:49,098
that the

104
00:03:49,098 --> 00:03:52,669
Lamanites withdrew

105
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:56,24
their design,

106
00:03:56,24 --> 00:03:59,811
and there was

107
00:03:59,811 --> 00:04:03,382
peace

108
00:04:03,382 --> 00:04:06,953
settled in the

109
00:04:06,953 --> 00:04:10,524
land; and peace

110
00:04:10,524 --> 00:04:14,095
did remain for

111
00:04:14,095 --> 00:04:17,666
the space of

112
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:21,237
about four

113
00:04:21,237 --> 00:04:24,808
years, that

114
00:04:24,808 --> 00:04:28,635
there was no bloodshed.

115
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:28,811
13 But

116
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:28,987
wickedness did

117
00:04:28,987 --> 00:04:29,163
prevail upon

118
00:04:29,163 --> 00:04:29,339
the face of

119
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:29,515
the whole

120
00:04:29,515 --> 00:04:29,691
land, insomuch

121
00:04:29,691 --> 00:04:29,867
that the

122
00:04:29,867 --> 00:04:30,043
Lord did take

123
00:04:30,043 --> 00:04:30,219
away his

124
00:04:30,219 --> 00:04:30,395
beloved

125
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:30,571
disciples, and the

126
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:30,747
work of

127
00:04:30,747 --> 00:04:30,923
miracles and of

128
00:04:30,923 --> 00:04:31,099
healing did

129
00:04:31,099 --> 00:04:31,275
cease because

130
00:04:31,275 --> 00:04:31,451
of the

131
00:04:31,451 --> 00:04:31,037
iniquity of the people.

132
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:32,219
14 And

133
00:04:32,219 --> 00:04:33,401
there were no

134
00:04:33,401 --> 00:04:34,583
gifts from

135
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:35,765
the Lord,

136
00:04:35,765 --> 00:04:36,947
and the Holy

137
00:04:36,947 --> 00:04:38,129
Ghost did

138
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:39,311
not come

139
00:04:39,311 --> 00:04:40,493
upon any,

140
00:04:40,493 --> 00:04:41,675
because of

141
00:04:41,675 --> 00:04:42,857
their

142
00:04:42,857 --> 00:04:44,384
wickedness and unbelief.

143
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:44,517
15 And I,

144
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:44,65
being

145
00:04:44,65 --> 00:04:44,783
fifteen years

146
00:04:44,783 --> 00:04:44,916
of age and

147
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:45,049
being

148
00:04:45,049 --> 00:04:45,182
somewhat of a

149
00:04:45,182 --> 00:04:45,315
sober

150
00:04:45,315 --> 00:04:45,448
mind,

151
00:04:45,448 --> 00:04:45,581
therefore I was

152
00:04:45,581 --> 00:04:45,714
visited of

153
00:04:45,714 --> 00:04:45,847
the Lord,

154
00:04:45,847 --> 00:04:45,98
and tasted

155
00:04:45,98 --> 00:04:46,113
and knew

156
00:04:46,113 --> 00:04:46,246
of the

157
00:04:46,246 --> 00:04:46,786
goodness of Jesus.

158
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:47,49
16 And I

159
00:04:47,49 --> 00:04:48,195
did

160
00:04:48,195 --> 00:04:48,899
endeavor to

161
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:49,602
preach unto

162
00:04:49,602 --> 00:04:50,306
this

163
00:04:50,306 --> 00:04:51,01
people, but

164
00:04:51,01 --> 00:04:51,714
my mouth

165
00:04:51,714 --> 00:04:52,418
was shut,

166
00:04:52,418 --> 00:04:53,123
and I

167
00:04:53,123 --> 00:04:53,827
was

168
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:54,53
forbidden that I

169
00:04:54,53 --> 00:04:55,234
should

170
00:04:55,234 --> 00:04:55,938
preach

171
00:04:55,938 --> 00:04:56,642
unto them;

172
00:04:56,642 --> 00:04:57,346
for behold

173
00:04:57,346 --> 00:04:58,05
they had

174
00:04:58,05 --> 00:04:58,755
wilfully

175
00:04:58,755 --> 00:04:59,459
rebelled

176
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:00,162
against

177
00:05:00,162 --> 00:05:00,866
their

178
00:05:00,866 --> 00:05:01,57
God; and the

179
00:05:01,57 --> 00:05:02,274
beloved

180
00:05:02,274 --> 00:05:02,978
disciples

181
00:05:02,978 --> 00:05:03,683
were

182
00:05:03,683 --> 00:05:04,387
taken away

183
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,09
out of the

184
00:05:05,09 --> 00:05:05,105
land, because of their iniquity.

185
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:05,06
17 But I

186
00:05:05,06 --> 00:05:05,015
did

187
00:05:05,015 --> 00:05:04,97
remain

188
00:05:04,97 --> 00:05:04,925
among them,

189
00:05:04,925 --> 00:05:04,88
but I

190
00:05:04,88 --> 00:05:04,835
was

191
00:05:04,835 --> 00:05:04,79
forbidden to

192
00:05:04,79 --> 00:05:04,745
preach

193
00:05:04,745 --> 00:05:04,7
unto them,

194
00:05:04,7 --> 00:05:04,655
because

195
00:05:04,655 --> 00:05:04,61
of the

196
00:05:04,61 --> 00:05:04,565
hardness

197
00:05:04,565 --> 00:05:04,52
of

198
00:05:04,52 --> 00:05:04,475
their

199
00:05:04,475 --> 00:05:04,43
hearts; and

200
00:05:04,43 --> 00:05:04,385
because of

201
00:05:04,385 --> 00:05:04,34
the

202
00:05:04,34 --> 00:05:04,295
hardness of

203
00:05:04,295 --> 00:05:04,25

insomuch

231
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:11,121
