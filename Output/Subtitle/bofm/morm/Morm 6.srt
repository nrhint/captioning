Chapter 6 The Nephites gather to the land

2
00:00:03,5 --> 00:00:07,0
of Cumorah for the final battles—Mormon

3
00:00:07,0 --> 00:00:10,5
hides the sacred records in the hill

4
00:00:10,5 --> 00:00:14,0
Cumorah—The Lamanites are victorious, and the

5
00:00:14,0 --> 00:00:17,5
Nephite nation is destroyed—Hundreds of

6
00:00:17,5 --> 00:00:21,355
thousands are slain with the sword. About A.D. 385. 

7
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:21,855
1 And now I finish my record

8
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:22,355
concerning the destruction of my people, the

9
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:22,855
Nephites. And it came to pass that we

10
00:00:22,855 --> 00:00:23,757
did march forth before the Lamanites.

11
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:23,614
2 And I, Mormon, wrote an epistle

12
00:00:23,614 --> 00:00:23,471
unto the king of the Lamanites, and

13
00:00:23,471 --> 00:00:23,328
desired of him that he would grant

14
00:00:23,328 --> 00:00:23,185
unto us that we might gather together

15
00:00:23,185 --> 00:00:23,042
our people unto the land of Cumorah,

16
00:00:23,042 --> 00:00:22,899
by a hill which was called Cumorah,

17
00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:22,823
and there we could give them battle.

18
00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:24,49
3 And it came to pass that the

19
00:00:24,49 --> 00:00:26,157
king of the Lamanites did grant

20
00:00:26,157 --> 00:00:27,227
unto me the thing which I desired.

21
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:29,227
4 And it came to pass that we

22
00:00:29,227 --> 00:00:31,227
did march forth to the land of

23
00:00:31,227 --> 00:00:33,227
Cumorah, and we did pitch our

24
00:00:33,227 --> 00:00:35,227
tents around about the hill

25
00:00:35,227 --> 00:00:37,227
Cumorah; and it was in a land

26
00:00:37,227 --> 00:00:39,227
of many waters, rivers, and

27
00:00:39,227 --> 00:00:41,227
fountains; and here we had hope

28
00:00:41,227 --> 00:00:43,644
to gain advantage over the Lamanites.

29
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:44,244
5 And when three hundred and

30
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:44,844
eighty and four years had

31
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:45,444
passed away, we had gathered

32
00:00:45,444 --> 00:00:46,044
in all the remainder of our

33
00:00:46,044 --> 00:00:46,046
people unto the land of Cumorah.

34
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:46,003
6 And it came to pass that

35
00:00:46,003 --> 00:00:45,96
when we had gathered in all

36
00:00:45,96 --> 00:00:45,917
our people in one to the

37
00:00:45,917 --> 00:00:45,874
land of Cumorah, behold I,

38
00:00:45,874 --> 00:00:45,831
Mormon, began to be old; and

39
00:00:45,831 --> 00:00:45,788
knowing it to be the last

40
00:00:45,788 --> 00:00:45,745
struggle of my people, and

41
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:45,702
having been commanded of

42
00:00:45,702 --> 00:00:45,659
the Lord that I should not

43
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:45,616
suffer the records which had

44
00:00:45,616 --> 00:00:45,573
been handed down by our

45
00:00:45,573 --> 00:00:45,53
fathers, which were sacred, to

46
00:00:45,53 --> 00:00:45,487
fall into the hands of the

47
00:00:45,487 --> 00:00:45,444
Lamanites, (for the

48
00:00:45,444 --> 00:00:45,401
Lamanites would destroy them)

49
00:00:45,401 --> 00:00:45,358
therefore I made this record

50
00:00:45,358 --> 00:00:45,315
out of the plates of Nephi,

51
00:00:45,315 --> 00:00:45,272
and hid up in the hill

52
00:00:45,272 --> 00:00:45,229
Cumorah all the records which

53
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:45,186
had been entrusted to me by

54
00:00:45,186 --> 00:00:45,143
the hand of the Lord, save

55
00:00:45,143 --> 00:00:45,1
it were these few plates

56
00:00:45,1 --> 00:00:45,112
which I gave unto my son Moroni.

57
00:00:45,112 --> 00:00:45,512
7 And it came to pass

58
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:45,912
that my people, with their

59
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:46,312
wives and their

60
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:46,712
children, did now behold the

61
00:00:46,712 --> 00:00:47,112
armies of the Lamanites

62
00:00:47,112 --> 00:00:47,512
marching towards them; and

63
00:00:47,512 --> 00:00:47,912
with that awful fear of

64
00:00:47,912 --> 00:00:48,312
death which fills the

65
00:00:48,312 --> 00:00:48,712
breasts of all the

66
00:00:48,712 --> 00:00:49,516
wicked, did they await to receive them.

67
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:49,349
8 And it came to pass

68
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:49,182
that they came to battle

69
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:49,015
against us, and every

70
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:48,848
soul was filled with

71
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:48,681
terror because of the

72
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:48,582
greatness of their numbers.

73
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:50,832
9 And it came to

74
00:00:50,832 --> 00:00:53,082
pass that they did fall

75
00:00:53,082 --> 00:00:55,332
upon my people with

76
00:00:55,332 --> 00:00:57,582
the sword, and with

77
00:00:57,582 --> 00:00:59,832
the bow, and with

78
00:00:59,832 --> 00:01:02,082
the arrow, and with

79
00:01:02,082 --> 00:01:04,332
the ax, and with all

80
00:01:04,332 --> 00:01:06,934
manner of weapons of war.

81
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:09,134
10 And it came to

82
00:01:09,134 --> 00:01:11,334
pass that my men

83
00:01:11,334 --> 00:01:13,534
were hewn down, yea,

84
00:01:13,534 --> 00:01:15,734
even my ten thousand

85
00:01:15,734 --> 00:01:17,934
who were with me,

86
00:01:17,934 --> 00:01:20,134
and I fell wounded

87
00:01:20,134 --> 00:01:22,334
in the midst; and

88
00:01:22,334 --> 00:01:24,534
they passed by me

89
00:01:24,534 --> 00:01:26,734
that they did not put

90
00:01:26,734 --> 00:01:28,755
an end to my life.

91
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:28,705
11 And when they

92
00:01:28,705 --> 00:01:28,655
had gone through

93
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:28,605
and hewn down all my

94
00:01:28,605 --> 00:01:28,555
people save it

95
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:28,505
were twenty and four

96
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:28,455
of us, (among

97
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:28,405
whom was my son

98
00:01:28,405 --> 00:01:28,355
Moroni) and we having

99
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:28,305
survived the dead

100
00:01:28,305 --> 00:01:28,255
of our people, did

101
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:28,205
behold on the

102
00:01:28,205 --> 00:01:28,155
morrow, when the

103
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:28,105
Lamanites had returned

104
00:01:28,105 --> 00:01:28,055
unto their camps,

105
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:28,005
from the top of

106
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:27,955
the hill Cumorah,

107
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:27,905
the ten thousand of

108
00:01:27,905 --> 00:01:27,855
my people who were

109
00:01:27,855 --> 00:01:27,805
hewn down, being

110
00:01:27,805 --> 00:01:27,821
led in the front by me.

111
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:27,621
12 And we also

112
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:27,421
beheld the ten

113
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:27,221
thousand of my

114
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:27,021
people who were led

115
00:01:27,021 --> 00:01:26,887
by my son Moroni.

116
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:26,72
13 And behold,

117
00:01:26,72 --> 00:01:26,553
the ten

118
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:26,386
thousand of

119
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:26,219
Gidgiddonah had

120
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:26,052
fallen, and he also

121
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:25,953
in the midst.

122
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:25,953
14 And Lamah

123
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:25,953
had fallen

124
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:25,953
with his ten

125
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:25,953
thousand; and

126
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:25,953
Gilgal had

127
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:25,953
fallen with his

128
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:25,953
ten thousand;

129
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:25,953
and Limhah

130
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:25,953
had fallen

131
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:25,953
with his ten

132
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:25,953
thousand; and

133
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:25,953
Jeneum had

134
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:25,953
fallen with his

135
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:25,953
ten thousand;

136
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:25,953
and

137
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:25,953
Cumenihah, and

138
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:25,953
Moronihah, and

139
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:25,953
Antionum, and

140
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:25,953
Shiblom, and

141
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:25,953
Shem, and Josh,

142
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:25,953
had fallen

143
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:25,018
with their ten thousand each.

144
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
15 And it

145
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
came to pass

146
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
that there

147
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
were ten more

148
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
who did fall

149
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
by the

150
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
sword, with

151
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
their ten

152
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
thousand each;

153
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
yea, even all

154
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
my people,

155
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
save it were

156
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
those twenty

157
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
and four who

158
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
were with

159
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
me, and also

160
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
a few who

161
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
had escaped

162
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
into the south

163
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
countries,

164
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
and a few

165
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
who had

166
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
deserted over unto

167
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
the

168
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
Lamanites, had

169
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
fallen; and

170
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
their flesh, and

171
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
bones, and

172
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
blood lay

173
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
upon the face

174
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
of the

175
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
earth, being left

176
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
by the

177
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
hands of those

178
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
who slew them

179
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
to molder

180
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
upon the

181
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
land, and to

182
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
crumble and to return to their mother earth.

183
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
16 And my

184
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
soul was

185
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
rent with

186
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
anguish,

187
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
because of

188
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
the slain

189
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
of my

190
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
people, and I cried:

191
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
17 O ye

192
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
fair ones,

193
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
how

194
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
could ye have

195
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
departed

196
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
from the

197
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
ways of

198
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
the Lord!

199
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
O ye

200
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
fair ones,

201
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
how could

202
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
ye have

203
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
rejected

204
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
that

205
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
Jesus, who

206
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
stood with

207
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
open arms to receive you!

208
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
18

209
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
Behold, if ye

210
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
had not

211
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
done

212
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
this, ye

213
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
would not

214
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
have

215
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
fallen.

216
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
But

217
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
behold, ye are

218
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
fallen,

219
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
and I

220
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
mourn your loss.

221
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
19 O ye

that ye

237
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
could have fallen!

238
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018
20 But

239
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018

247
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018

And the

256
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:25,018

then are ye blessed with your fathers who have gone before you.

309

22 O
