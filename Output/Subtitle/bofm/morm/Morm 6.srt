00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,167
Chapter 6 The Nephites gather to the land of

2
00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:02,334
 Cumorah for the final battles—Mormon hides the sacred

3
00:00:02,334 --> 00:00:03,501
 records in the hill Cumorah—The Lamanites are

4
00:00:03,501 --> 00:00:04,668
 victorious, and the Nephite nation is

5
00:00:04,668 --> 00:00:05,835
 destroyed—Hundreds of thousands are slain with the sword. About

6
00:00:05,835 --> 00:00:07,002
 A.D. 385.

7
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:10,642
1 And now I finish my record concerning the

8
00:00:10,642 --> 00:00:13,309
 destruction of my people, the Nephites. And it came to

9
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:15,976
 pass that we did march forth before the Lamanites

10
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,282
2 And I, Mormon, wrote an epistle unto the king of

11
00:00:17,282 --> 00:00:18,615
 the Lamanites, and desired of him that he would

12
00:00:18,615 --> 00:00:19,948
 grant unto us that we might gather together our

13
00:00:19,948 --> 00:00:21,281
 people unto the land of Cumorah, by a hill which was

14
00:00:21,281 --> 00:00:22,614
 called Cumorah, and there we could give them

15
00:00:22,614 --> 00:00:23,947
 battle

16
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:27,924
3 And it came to pass that the king of the

17
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:31,924
 Lamanites did grant unto me the thing which I desired

18
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,499
4 And it came to pass that we did march forth to

19
00:00:33,499 --> 00:00:35,099
 the land of Cumorah, and we did pitch our tents

20
00:00:35,099 --> 00:00:36,699
 around about the hill Cumorah; and it was in a land

21
00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:38,299
 of many waters, rivers, and fountains; and here we

22
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:39,899
 had hope to gain advantage over the Lamanites

23
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,54
5 And when three hundred and eighty and four years

24
00:00:42,54 --> 00:00:45,207
 had passed away, we had gathered in all the

25
00:00:45,207 --> 00:00:47,874
 remainder of our people unto the land of Cumorah

26
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:48,463
6 And it came to pass that when we had gathered in

27
00:00:48,463 --> 00:00:49,078
 all our people in one to the land of Cumorah,

28
00:00:49,078 --> 00:00:49,693
 behold I, Mormon, began to be old; and knowing it to

29
00:00:49,693 --> 00:00:50,308
 be the last struggle of my people, and having been

30
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:50,923
 commanded of the Lord that I should not suffer

31
00:00:50,923 --> 00:00:51,538
 the records which had been handed down by our

32
00:00:51,538 --> 00:00:52,153
 fathers, which were sacred, to fall into the hands of

33
00:00:52,153 --> 00:00:52,768
 the Lamanites, (for the Lamanites would destroy

34
00:00:52,768 --> 00:00:53,383
 them) therefore I made this record out of the plates

35
00:00:53,383 --> 00:00:53,998
 of Nephi, and hid up in the hill Cumorah all the

36
00:00:53,998 --> 00:00:54,613
 records which had been entrusted to me by the hand

37
00:00:54,613 --> 00:00:55,228
 of the Lord, save it were these few plates which I

38
00:00:55,228 --> 00:00:55,843
 gave unto my son Moroni

39
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,422
7 And it came to pass that my people, with their

40
00:00:57,422 --> 00:00:59,022
 wives and their children, did now behold the armies

41
00:00:59,022 --> 00:01:00,622
 of the Lamanites marching towards them; and with

42
00:01:00,622 --> 00:01:02,222
 that awful fear of death which fills the breasts

43
00:01:02,222 --> 00:01:03,822
 of all the wicked, did they await to receive them

44
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:14,464
8 And it came to pass that they came to battle

45
00:01:14,464 --> 00:01:25,131
 against us, and every soul was filled with terror

46
00:01:25,131 --> 00:01:35,798
 because of the greatness of their numbers

47
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:39,696
9 And it came to pass that they did fall upon my

48
00:01:39,696 --> 00:01:43,696
 people with the sword, and with the bow, and with

49
00:01:43,696 --> 00:01:47,696
 the arrow, and with the ax, and with all manner of

50
00:01:47,696 --> 00:01:51,696
 weapons of war

51
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:57,645
10 And it came to pass that my men were hewn down,

52
00:01:57,645 --> 00:02:03,645
 yea, even my ten thousand who were with me, and I

53
00:02:03,645 --> 00:02:09,645
 fell wounded in the midst; and they passed by me

54
00:02:09,645 --> 00:02:15,645
 that they did not put an end to my life

55
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:16,569
11 And when they had gone through and hewn down

56
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:17,569
 all my people save it were twenty and four of us,

57
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:18,569
 (among whom was my son Moroni) and we having

58
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:19,569
 survived the dead of our people, did behold on the

59
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:20,569
 morrow, when the Lamanites had returned unto their

60
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:21,569
 camps, from the top of the hill Cumorah, the ten

61
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:22,569
 thousand of my people who were hewn down, being led in

62
00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:23,569
 the front by me

63
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:27,543
12 And we also beheld the ten thousand of my

64
00:02:27,543 --> 00:02:31,543
 people who were led by my son Moroni

65
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:43,518
13 And behold, the ten thousand of Gidgiddonah had

66
00:02:43,518 --> 00:02:55,518
 fallen, and he also in the midst

67
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:59,442
14 And Lamah had fallen with his ten thousand; and

68
00:02:59,442 --> 00:03:03,442
 Gilgal had fallen with his ten thousand; and

69
00:03:03,442 --> 00:03:07,442
 Limhah had fallen with his ten thousand; and Jeneum

70
00:03:07,442 --> 00:03:11,442
 had fallen with his ten thousand; and Cumenihah, and

71
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:15,442
 Moronihah, and Antionum, and Shiblom, and Shem,

72
00:03:15,442 --> 00:03:19,442
 and Josh, had fallen with their ten thousand each

73
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,166
15 And it came to pass that there were ten more

74
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:20,966
 who did fall by the sword, with their ten thousand

75
00:03:20,966 --> 00:03:21,766
 each; yea, even all my people, save it were those

76
00:03:21,766 --> 00:03:22,566
 twenty and four who were with me, and also a few

77
00:03:22,566 --> 00:03:23,366
 who had escaped into the south countries, and a few

78
00:03:23,366 --> 00:03:24,166
 who had deserted over unto the Lamanites, had

79
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:24,966
 fallen; and their flesh, and bones, and blood lay upon

80
00:03:24,966 --> 00:03:25,766
 the face of the earth, being left by the hands of

81
00:03:25,766 --> 00:03:26,566
 those who slew them to molder upon the land, and

82
00:03:26,566 --> 00:03:27,366
 to crumble and to return to their mother earth

83
00:03:27,34 --> 00:03:31,34
16 And my soul was rent with anguish, because of

84
00:03:31,34 --> 00:03:35,34
 the slain of my people, and I cried

85
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:41,315
17 O ye fair ones, how could ye have departed from

86
00:03:41,315 --> 00:03:47,315
 the ways of the Lord! O ye fair ones, how could

87
00:03:47,315 --> 00:03:53,315
 ye have rejected that Jesus, who stood with open

88
00:03:53,315 --> 00:03:59,315
 arms to receive you

89
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,906
18 Behold, if ye had not done this, ye would not

90
00:04:01,906 --> 00:04:04,573
 have fallen. But behold, ye are fallen, and I mourn

91
00:04:04,573 --> 00:04:07,24
 your loss

92
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:09,881
19 O ye fair sons and daughters, ye fathers and

93
00:04:09,881 --> 00:04:12,548
 mothers, ye husbands and wives, ye fair ones, how is

94
00:04:12,548 --> 00:04:15,215
 it that ye could have fallen

95
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:31,188
20 But behold, ye are gone, and my sorrows cannot

96
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:47,188
 bring your return

97
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:48,087
21 And the day soon cometh that your mortal must

98
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:49,087
 put on immortality, and these bodies which are now

99
00:04:49,087 --> 00:04:50,087
 moldering in corruption must soon become

100
00:04:50,087 --> 00:04:51,087
 incorruptible bodies; and then ye must stand before the

101
00:04:51,087 --> 00:04:52,087
 judgment-seat of Christ, to be judged according to

102
00:04:52,087 --> 00:04:53,087
 your works; and if it so be that ye are righteous,

103
00:04:53,087 --> 00:04:54,087
 then are ye blessed with your fathers who have gone

104
00:04:54,087 --> 00:04:55,087
 before you

105
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:55,061
22 O that ye had repented before this great

106
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:55,061
 destruction had come upon you. But behold, ye are gone,

107
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:55,061
 and the Father, yea, the Eternal Father of heaven,

108
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:55,061
 knoweth your state; and he doeth with you

109
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:55,061
 according to his justice and mercy.
