Chapter 6 The Nephites gather to the land

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of Cumorah for the final battles—Mormon

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
hides the sacred records in the hill

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Cumorah—The Lamanites are victorious, and the

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Nephite nation is destroyed—Hundreds of

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:11:07,
thousands are slain with the sword. About A.D. 385. 

7
00:11:07,0 --> 00:11:07,0
1 And now I finish my record

8
00:11:07,0 --> 00:11:07,0
concerning the destruction of my people, the

9
00:11:07,0 --> 00:11:07,0
Nephites. And it came to pass that we

10
00:11:07,0 --> 00:17:48,
did march forth before the Lamanites.

11
00:17:48,0 --> 00:17:48,0
2 And I, Mormon, wrote an epistle

12
00:17:48,0 --> 00:17:48,0
unto the king of the Lamanites, and

13
00:17:48,0 --> 00:17:48,0
desired of him that he would grant

14
00:17:48,0 --> 00:17:48,0
unto us that we might gather together

15
00:17:48,0 --> 00:17:48,0
our people unto the land of Cumorah,

16
00:17:48,0 --> 00:17:48,0
by a hill which was called Cumorah,

17
00:17:48,0 --> 00:22:59,
and there we could give them battle.

18
00:22:59,0 --> 00:22:59,0
3 And it came to pass that the

19
00:22:59,0 --> 00:22:59,0
king of the Lamanites did grant

20
00:22:59,0 --> 00:22:31,
unto me the thing which I desired.

21
00:22:31,0 --> 00:22:31,0
4 And it came to pass that we

22
00:22:31,0 --> 00:22:31,0
did march forth to the land of

23
00:22:31,0 --> 00:22:31,0
Cumorah, and we did pitch our

24
00:22:31,0 --> 00:22:31,0
tents around about the hill

25
00:22:31,0 --> 00:22:31,0
Cumorah; and it was in a land

26
00:22:31,0 --> 00:22:31,0
of many waters, rivers, and

27
00:22:31,0 --> 00:22:31,0
fountains; and here we had hope

28
00:22:31,0 --> 00:24:43,
to gain advantage over the Lamanites.

29
00:24:43,0 --> 00:24:43,0
5 And when three hundred and

30
00:24:43,0 --> 00:24:43,0
eighty and four years had

31
00:24:43,0 --> 00:24:43,0
passed away, we had gathered

32
00:24:43,0 --> 00:24:43,0
in all the remainder of our

33
00:24:43,0 --> 00:30:39,
people unto the land of Cumorah.

34
00:30:39,0 --> 00:30:39,0
6 And it came to pass that

35
00:30:39,0 --> 00:30:39,0
when we had gathered in all

36
00:30:39,0 --> 00:30:39,0
our people in one to the

37
00:30:39,0 --> 00:30:39,0
land of Cumorah, behold I,

38
00:30:39,0 --> 00:30:39,0
Mormon, began to be old; and

39
00:30:39,0 --> 00:30:39,0
knowing it to be the last

40
00:30:39,0 --> 00:30:39,0
struggle of my people, and

41
00:30:39,0 --> 00:30:39,0
having been commanded of

42
00:30:39,0 --> 00:30:39,0
the Lord that I should not

43
00:30:39,0 --> 00:30:39,0
suffer the records which had

44
00:30:39,0 --> 00:30:39,0
been handed down by our

45
00:30:39,0 --> 00:30:39,0
fathers, which were sacred, to

46
00:30:39,0 --> 00:30:39,0
fall into the hands of the

47
00:30:39,0 --> 00:30:39,0
Lamanites, (for the

48
00:30:39,0 --> 00:30:39,0
Lamanites would destroy them)

49
00:30:39,0 --> 00:30:39,0
therefore I made this record

50
00:30:39,0 --> 00:30:39,0
out of the plates of Nephi,

51
00:30:39,0 --> 00:30:39,0
and hid up in the hill

52
00:30:39,0 --> 00:30:39,0
Cumorah all the records which

53
00:30:39,0 --> 00:30:39,0
had been entrusted to me by

54
00:30:39,0 --> 00:30:39,0
the hand of the Lord, save

55
00:30:39,0 --> 00:30:39,0
it were these few plates

56
00:30:39,0 --> 00:30:11,
which I gave unto my son Moroni.

57
00:30:11,0 --> 00:30:11,0
7 And it came to pass

58
00:30:11,0 --> 00:30:11,0
that my people, with their

59
00:30:11,0 --> 00:30:11,0
wives and their

60
00:30:11,0 --> 00:30:11,0
children, did now behold the

61
00:30:11,0 --> 00:30:11,0
armies of the Lamanites

62
00:30:11,0 --> 00:30:11,0
marching towards them; and

63
00:30:11,0 --> 00:30:11,0
with that awful fear of

64
00:30:11,0 --> 00:30:11,0
death which fills the

65
00:30:11,0 --> 00:30:11,0
breasts of all the

66
00:30:11,0 --> 00:33:56,
wicked, did they await to receive them.

67
00:33:56,0 --> 00:33:56,0
8 And it came to pass

68
00:33:56,0 --> 00:33:56,0
that they came to battle

69
00:33:56,0 --> 00:33:56,0
against us, and every

70
00:33:56,0 --> 00:33:56,0
soul was filled with

71
00:33:56,0 --> 00:33:56,0
terror because of the

72
00:33:56,0 --> 00:37:27,
greatness of their numbers.

73
00:37:27,0 --> 00:37:27,0
9 And it came to

74
00:37:27,0 --> 00:37:27,0
pass that they did fall

75
00:37:27,0 --> 00:37:27,0
upon my people with

76
00:37:27,0 --> 00:37:27,0
the sword, and with

77
00:37:27,0 --> 00:37:27,0
the bow, and with

78
00:37:27,0 --> 00:37:27,0
the arrow, and with

79
00:37:27,0 --> 00:37:27,0
the ax, and with all

80
00:37:27,0 --> 00:44:35,
manner of weapons of war.

81
00:44:35,0 --> 00:44:35,0
10 And it came to

82
00:44:35,0 --> 00:44:35,0
pass that my men

83
00:44:35,0 --> 00:44:35,0
were hewn down, yea,

84
00:44:35,0 --> 00:44:35,0
even my ten thousand

85
00:44:35,0 --> 00:44:35,0
who were with me,

86
00:44:35,0 --> 00:44:35,0
and I fell wounded

87
00:44:35,0 --> 00:44:35,0
in the midst; and

88
00:44:35,0 --> 00:44:35,0
they passed by me

89
00:44:35,0 --> 00:44:35,0
that they did not put

90
00:44:35,0 --> 00:46:47,
an end to my life.

91
00:46:47,0 --> 00:46:47,0
11 And when they

92
00:46:47,0 --> 00:46:47,0
had gone through

93
00:46:47,0 --> 00:46:47,0
and hewn down all my

94
00:46:47,0 --> 00:46:47,0
people save it

95
00:46:47,0 --> 00:46:47,0
were twenty and four

96
00:46:47,0 --> 00:46:47,0
of us, (among

97
00:46:47,0 --> 00:46:47,0
whom was my son

98
00:46:47,0 --> 00:46:47,0
Moroni) and we having

99
00:46:47,0 --> 00:46:47,0
survived the dead

100
00:46:47,0 --> 00:46:47,0
of our people, did

101
00:46:47,0 --> 00:46:47,0
behold on the

102
00:46:47,0 --> 00:46:47,0
morrow, when the

103
00:46:47,0 --> 00:46:47,0
Lamanites had returned

104
00:46:47,0 --> 00:46:47,0
unto their camps,

105
00:46:47,0 --> 00:46:47,0
from the top of

106
00:46:47,0 --> 00:46:47,0
the hill Cumorah,

107
00:46:47,0 --> 00:46:47,0
the ten thousand of

108
00:46:47,0 --> 00:46:47,0
my people who were

109
00:46:47,0 --> 00:46:47,0
hewn down, being

110
00:46:47,0 --> 00:46:19,
led in the front by me.

111
00:46:19,0 --> 00:46:19,0
12 And we also

112
00:46:19,0 --> 00:46:19,0
beheld the ten

113
00:46:19,0 --> 00:46:19,0
thousand of my

114
00:46:19,0 --> 00:46:19,0
people who were led

115
00:46:19,0 --> 00:47:31,
by my son Moroni.

116
00:47:31,0 --> 00:47:31,0
13 And behold,

117
00:47:31,0 --> 00:47:31,0
the ten

118
00:47:31,0 --> 00:47:31,0
thousand of

119
00:47:31,0 --> 00:47:31,0
Gidgiddonah had

120
00:47:31,0 --> 00:47:31,0
fallen, and he also

121
00:47:31,0 --> 00:47:03,
in the midst.

122
00:47:03,0 --> 00:47:03,0
14 And Lamah

123
00:47:03,0 --> 00:47:03,0
had fallen

124
00:47:03,0 --> 00:47:03,0
with his ten

125
00:47:03,0 --> 00:47:03,0
thousand; and

126
00:47:03,0 --> 00:47:03,0
Gilgal had

127
00:47:03,0 --> 00:47:03,0
fallen with his

128
00:47:03,0 --> 00:47:03,0
ten thousand;

129
00:47:03,0 --> 00:47:03,0
and Limhah

130
00:47:03,0 --> 00:47:03,0
had fallen

131
00:47:03,0 --> 00:47:03,0
with his ten

132
00:47:03,0 --> 00:47:03,0
thousand; and

133
00:47:03,0 --> 00:47:03,0
Jeneum had

134
00:47:03,0 --> 00:47:03,0
fallen with his

135
00:47:03,0 --> 00:47:03,0
ten thousand;

136
00:47:03,0 --> 00:47:03,0
and

137
00:47:03,0 --> 00:47:03,0
Cumenihah, and

138
00:47:03,0 --> 00:47:03,0
Moronihah, and

139
00:47:03,0 --> 00:47:03,0
Antionum, and

140
00:47:03,0 --> 00:47:03,0
Shiblom, and

141
00:47:03,0 --> 00:47:03,0
Shem, and Josh,

142
00:47:03,0 --> 00:47:03,0
had fallen

143
00:47:03,0 --> 00:46:35,
with their ten thousand each.

144
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
15 And it

145
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
came to pass

146
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
that there

147
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
were ten more

148
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
who did fall

149
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
by the

150
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
sword, with

151
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
their ten

152
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
thousand each;

153
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
yea, even all

154
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
my people,

155
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
save it were

156
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
those twenty

157
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
and four who

158
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
were with

159
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
me, and also

160
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
a few who

161
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
had escaped

162
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
into the south

163
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
countries,

164
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
and a few

165
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
who had

166
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
deserted over unto

167
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
the

168
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
Lamanites, had

169
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
fallen; and

170
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
their flesh, and

171
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
bones, and

172
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
blood lay

173
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
upon the face

174
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
of the

175
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
earth, being left

176
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
by the

177
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
hands of those

178
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
who slew them

179
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
to molder

180
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
upon the

181
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
land, and to

182
00:46:35,0 --> 00:48:47,
crumble and to return to their mother earth.

183
00:48:47,0 --> 00:48:47,0
16 And my

184
00:48:47,0 --> 00:48:47,0
soul was

185
00:48:47,0 --> 00:48:47,0
rent with

186
00:48:47,0 --> 00:48:47,0
anguish,

187
00:48:47,0 --> 00:48:47,0
because of

188
00:48:47,0 --> 00:48:47,0
the slain

189
00:48:47,0 --> 00:48:47,0
of my

190
00:48:47,0 --> 00:50:59,
people, and I cried:

191
00:50:59,0 --> 00:50:59,0
17 O ye

192
00:50:59,0 --> 00:50:59,0
fair ones,

193
00:50:59,0 --> 00:50:59,0
how

194
00:50:59,0 --> 00:50:59,0
could ye have

195
00:50:59,0 --> 00:50:59,0
departed

196
00:50:59,0 --> 00:50:59,0
from the

197
00:50:59,0 --> 00:50:59,0
ways of

198
00:50:59,0 --> 00:50:59,0
the Lord!

199
00:50:59,0 --> 00:50:59,0
O ye

200
00:50:59,0 --> 00:50:59,0
fair ones,

201
00:50:59,0 --> 00:50:59,0
how could

202
00:50:59,0 --> 00:50:59,0
ye have

203
00:50:59,0 --> 00:50:59,0
rejected

204
00:50:59,0 --> 00:50:59,0
that

205
00:50:59,0 --> 00:50:59,0
Jesus, who

206
00:50:59,0 --> 00:50:59,0
stood with

207
00:50:59,0 --> 00:50:31,
open arms to receive you!

208
00:50:31,0 --> 00:50:31,0
18

209
00:50:31,0 --> 00:50:31,0
Behold, if ye

210
00:50:31,0 --> 00:50:31,0
had not

211
00:50:31,0 --> 00:50:31,0
done

212
00:50:31,0 --> 00:50:31,0
this, ye

213
00:50:31,0 --> 00:50:31,0
would not

214
00:50:31,0 --> 00:50:31,0
have

215
00:50:31,0 --> 00:50:31,0
fallen.

216
00:50:31,0 --> 00:50:31,0
But

217
00:50:31,0 --> 00:50:31,0
behold, ye are

218
00:50:31,0 --> 00:50:31,0
fallen,

219
00:50:31,0 --> 00:50:31,0
and I

220
00:50:31,0 --> 00:52:59,
