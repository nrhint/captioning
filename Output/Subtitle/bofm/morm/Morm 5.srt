00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 5 Mormon again leads the Nephite

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
armies in battles of blood and carnage—The Book

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of Mormon will come forth to convince all

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Israel that Jesus is the Christ—Because of

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
their unbelief, the Lamanites will be

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
scattered, and the Spirit will cease to strive with

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
them—They will receive the gospel from the

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:06:41,
Gentiles in the latter days. About A.D. 375–84. 

9
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
1 And it came to pass that I did go

10
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
forth among the Nephites, and did repent

11
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
of the oath which I had made that I

12
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
would no more assist them; and they

13
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
gave me command again of their armies,

14
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
for they looked upon me as though I

15
00:06:41,0 --> 00:15:51,
could deliver them from their afflictions.

16
00:15:51,0 --> 00:15:51,0
2 But behold, I was without hope, for

17
00:15:51,0 --> 00:15:51,0
I knew the judgments of the Lord

18
00:15:51,0 --> 00:15:51,0
which should come upon them; for they

19
00:15:51,0 --> 00:15:51,0
repented not of their iniquities, but

20
00:15:51,0 --> 00:15:51,0
did struggle for their lives without

21
00:15:51,0 --> 00:23:49,
calling upon that Being who created them.

22
00:23:49,0 --> 00:23:49,0
3 And it came to pass that the

23
00:23:49,0 --> 00:23:49,0
Lamanites did come against us as we had

24
00:23:49,0 --> 00:23:49,0
fled to the city of Jordan; but

25
00:23:49,0 --> 00:23:49,0
behold, they were driven back that

26
00:23:49,0 --> 00:29:00,
they did not take the city at that time.

27
00:29:00,0 --> 00:29:00,0
4 And it came to pass that they

28
00:29:00,0 --> 00:29:00,0
came against us again, and we

29
00:29:00,0 --> 00:29:00,0
did maintain the city. And there

30
00:29:00,0 --> 00:29:00,0
were also other cities which were

31
00:29:00,0 --> 00:29:00,0
maintained by the Nephites,

32
00:29:00,0 --> 00:29:00,0
which strongholds did cut them off

33
00:29:00,0 --> 00:29:00,0
that they could not get into the

34
00:29:00,0 --> 00:29:00,0
country which lay before us, to

35
00:29:00,0 --> 00:28:32,
destroy the inhabitants of our land.

36
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
5 But it came to pass that

37
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
whatsoever lands we had passed

38
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
by, and the inhabitants thereof

39
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
were not gathered in, were

40
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
destroyed by the Lamanites, and

41
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
their towns, and villages, and

42
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
cities were burned with fire;

43
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
and thus three hundred and

44
00:28:32,0 --> 00:30:44,
seventy and nine years passed away.

45
00:30:44,0 --> 00:30:44,0
6 And it came to pass that

46
00:30:44,0 --> 00:30:44,0
in the three hundred and

47
00:30:44,0 --> 00:30:44,0
eightieth year the Lamanites

48
00:30:44,0 --> 00:30:44,0
did come again against us

49
00:30:44,0 --> 00:30:44,0
to battle, and we did stand

50
00:30:44,0 --> 00:30:44,0
against them boldly; but it

51
00:30:44,0 --> 00:30:44,0
was all in vain, for so

52
00:30:44,0 --> 00:30:44,0
great were their numbers that

53
00:30:44,0 --> 00:30:44,0
they did tread the people

54
00:30:44,0 --> 00:35:54,
of the Nephites under their feet.

55
00:35:54,0 --> 00:35:54,0
7 And it came to pass

56
00:35:54,0 --> 00:35:54,0
that we did again take to

57
00:35:54,0 --> 00:35:54,0
flight, and those whose

58
00:35:54,0 --> 00:35:54,0
flight was swifter than the

59
00:35:54,0 --> 00:35:54,0
Lamanites’ did escape,

60
00:35:54,0 --> 00:35:54,0
and those whose flight did

61
00:35:54,0 --> 00:35:54,0
not exceed the Lamanites’

62
00:35:54,0 --> 00:38:50,
were swept down and destroyed.

63
00:38:50,0 --> 00:38:50,0
8 And now behold, I,

64
00:38:50,0 --> 00:38:50,0
Mormon, do not desire to

65
00:38:50,0 --> 00:38:50,0
harrow up the souls of men

66
00:38:50,0 --> 00:38:50,0
in casting before them

67
00:38:50,0 --> 00:38:50,0
such an awful scene of

68
00:38:50,0 --> 00:38:50,0
blood and carnage as was

69
00:38:50,0 --> 00:38:50,0
laid before mine eyes;

70
00:38:50,0 --> 00:38:50,0
but I, knowing that these

71
00:38:50,0 --> 00:38:50,0
things must surely be

72
00:38:50,0 --> 00:38:50,0
made known, and that all

73
00:38:50,0 --> 00:38:50,0
things which are hid

74
00:38:50,0 --> 00:42:20,
must be revealed upon the house-tops—

75
00:42:20,0 --> 00:42:20,0
9 And also that a

76
00:42:20,0 --> 00:42:20,0
knowledge of these things

77
00:42:20,0 --> 00:42:20,0
must come unto the

78
00:42:20,0 --> 00:42:20,0
remnant of these people, and

79
00:42:20,0 --> 00:42:20,0
also unto the Gentiles,

80
00:42:20,0 --> 00:42:20,0
who the Lord hath said

81
00:42:20,0 --> 00:42:20,0
should scatter this

82
00:42:20,0 --> 00:42:20,0
people, and this people

83
00:42:20,0 --> 00:42:20,0
should be counted as

84
00:42:20,0 --> 00:42:20,0
naught among

85
00:42:20,0 --> 00:42:20,0
them—therefore I write a small

86
00:42:20,0 --> 00:42:20,0
abridgment, daring not to

87
00:42:20,0 --> 00:42:20,0
give a full account of

88
00:42:20,0 --> 00:42:20,0
the things which I have

89
00:42:20,0 --> 00:42:20,0
seen, because of the

90
00:42:20,0 --> 00:42:20,0
commandment which I have

91
00:42:20,0 --> 00:42:20,0
received, and also that

92
00:42:20,0 --> 00:42:20,0
ye might not have too

93
00:42:20,0 --> 00:42:20,0
great sorrow because of

94
00:42:20,0 --> 00:45:51,
the wickedness of this people.

95
00:45:51,0 --> 00:45:51,0
10 And now behold,

96
00:45:51,0 --> 00:45:51,0
this I speak unto their

97
00:45:51,0 --> 00:45:51,0
seed, and also to

98
00:45:51,0 --> 00:45:51,0
the Gentiles who have

99
00:45:51,0 --> 00:45:51,0
care for the house of

100
00:45:51,0 --> 00:45:51,0
Israel, that realize

101
00:45:51,0 --> 00:45:51,0
and know from whence

102
00:45:51,0 --> 00:49:50,
their blessings come.

103
00:49:50,0 --> 00:49:50,0
11 For I know that

104
00:49:50,0 --> 00:49:50,0
such will sorrow for

105
00:49:50,0 --> 00:49:50,0
the calamity of the

106
00:49:50,0 --> 00:49:50,0
house of Israel;

107
00:49:50,0 --> 00:49:50,0
yea, they will sorrow

108
00:49:50,0 --> 00:49:50,0
for the destruction

109
00:49:50,0 --> 00:49:50,0
of this people; they

110
00:49:50,0 --> 00:49:50,0
will sorrow that

111
00:49:50,0 --> 00:49:50,0
this people had not

112
00:49:50,0 --> 00:49:50,0
repented that they

113
00:49:50,0 --> 00:49:50,0
might have been clasped

114
00:49:50,0 --> 00:54:18,
in the arms of Jesus.

115
00:54:18,0 --> 00:54:18,0
12 Now these things

116
00:54:18,0 --> 00:54:18,0
are written unto

117
00:54:18,0 --> 00:54:18,0
the remnant of the

118
00:54:18,0 --> 00:54:18,0
house of Jacob; and

119
00:54:18,0 --> 00:54:18,0
they are written

120
00:54:18,0 --> 00:54:18,0
after this manner,

121
00:54:18,0 --> 00:54:18,0
because it is known

122
00:54:18,0 --> 00:54:18,0
of God that

123
00:54:18,0 --> 00:54:18,0
wickedness will not bring

124
00:54:18,0 --> 00:54:18,0
them forth unto

125
00:54:18,0 --> 00:54:18,0
them; and they are to

126
00:54:18,0 --> 00:54:18,0
be hid up unto the

127
00:54:18,0 --> 00:54:18,0
Lord that they may

128
00:54:18,0 --> 00:59:28,
come forth in his own due time.

129
00:59:28,0 --> 00:59:28,0
13 And this is the

130
00:59:28,0 --> 00:59:28,0
commandment which

131
00:59:28,0 --> 00:59:28,0
I have received;

132
00:59:28,0 --> 00:59:28,0
and behold, they

133
00:59:28,0 --> 00:59:28,0
shall come forth

134
00:59:28,0 --> 00:59:28,0
according to the

135
00:59:28,0 --> 00:59:28,0
commandment of the

136
00:59:28,0 --> 00:59:28,0
Lord, when he shall

137
00:59:28,0 --> 01:01:40,
see fit, in his wisdom.

138
01:01:40,0 --> 01:01:40,0
14 And behold,

139
01:01:40,0 --> 01:01:40,0
they shall go unto

140
01:01:40,0 --> 01:01:40,0
the unbelieving

141
01:01:40,0 --> 01:01:40,0
of the Jews; and

142
01:01:40,0 --> 01:01:40,0
for this intent

143
01:01:40,0 --> 01:01:40,0
shall they go—that

144
01:01:40,0 --> 01:01:40,0
they may be

145
01:01:40,0 --> 01:01:40,0
persuaded that Jesus

146
01:01:40,0 --> 01:01:40,0
is the Christ, the

147
01:01:40,0 --> 01:01:40,0
Son of the

148
01:01:40,0 --> 01:01:40,0
living God; that the

149
01:01:40,0 --> 01:01:40,0
Father may bring

150
01:01:40,0 --> 01:01:40,0
about, through his

151
01:01:40,0 --> 01:01:40,0
most Beloved,

152
01:01:40,0 --> 01:01:40,0
his great and

153
01:01:40,0 --> 01:01:40,0
eternal purpose, in

154
01:01:40,0 --> 01:01:40,0
restoring the Jews,

155
01:01:40,0 --> 01:01:40,0
or all the house

156
01:01:40,0 --> 01:01:40,0
of Israel, to

157
01:01:40,0 --> 01:01:40,0
the land of their

158
01:01:40,0 --> 01:01:40,0
inheritance, which

159
01:01:40,0 --> 01:01:40,0
the Lord their

160
01:01:40,0 --> 01:01:40,0
God hath given

161
01:01:40,0 --> 01:06:50,
them, unto the fulfilling of his covenant;

162
01:06:50,0 --> 01:06:50,0
15 And also that

163
01:06:50,0 --> 01:06:50,0
the seed of

164
01:06:50,0 --> 01:06:50,0
this people may

165
01:06:50,0 --> 01:06:50,0
more fully believe

166
01:06:50,0 --> 01:06:50,0
his gospel,

167
01:06:50,0 --> 01:06:50,0
which shall go forth

168
01:06:50,0 --> 01:06:50,0
unto them from

169
01:06:50,0 --> 01:06:50,0
the Gentiles;

170
01:06:50,0 --> 01:06:50,0
for this people

171
01:06:50,0 --> 01:06:50,0
shall be

172
01:06:50,0 --> 01:06:50,0
scattered, and shall

173
01:06:50,0 --> 01:06:50,0
become a dark, a

174
01:06:50,0 --> 01:06:50,0
filthy, and a

175
01:06:50,0 --> 01:06:50,0
loathsome people,

176
01:06:50,0 --> 01:06:50,0
beyond the

177
01:06:50,0 --> 01:06:50,0
description of that

178
01:06:50,0 --> 01:06:50,0
which ever hath been

179
01:06:50,0 --> 01:06:50,0
amongst us,

180
01:06:50,0 --> 01:06:50,0
yea, even that

181
01:06:50,0 --> 01:06:50,0
which hath been

182
01:06:50,0 --> 01:06:50,0
among the Lamanites,

183
01:06:50,0 --> 01:06:50,0
and this

184
01:06:50,0 --> 01:11:47,
because of their unbelief and idolatry.

185
01:11:47,0 --> 01:11:47,0
16 For behold,

186
01:11:47,0 --> 01:11:47,0
the Spirit of

187
01:11:47,0 --> 01:11:47,0
the Lord hath

188
01:11:47,0 --> 01:11:47,0
already ceased to

189
01:11:47,0 --> 01:11:47,0
strive with

190
01:11:47,0 --> 01:11:47,0
their fathers;

191
01:11:47,0 --> 01:11:47,0
and they are

192
01:11:47,0 --> 01:11:47,0
without Christ and

193
01:11:47,0 --> 01:11:47,0
God in the

194
01:11:47,0 --> 01:11:47,0
world; and they are

195
01:11:47,0 --> 01:11:47,0
driven about

196
01:11:47,0 --> 01:11:19,
as chaff before the wind.

197
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
17 They were

198
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
once a

199
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
delightsome people,

200
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
and they had

201
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
Christ for

202
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
their

203
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
shepherd; yea, they

204
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
were led even

205
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,
by God the Father.

206
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
18 But now,

207
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
behold, they

208
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
are led

209
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
about by Satan,

210
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
even as

211
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
chaff is driven

212
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
before the

213
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
wind, or as

214
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
a vessel is

215
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
tossed about

216
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
upon the

217
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
waves, without

218
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
sail or

219
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
anchor, or

220
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
without anything

221
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
wherewith

222
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
to steer her;

223
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
and even as

224
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,
she is, so are they.

225
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
19 And

226
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
behold, the

227
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
Lord hath

228
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
reserved their

229
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
blessings,

230
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
which they

231
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
might have

232
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
received in

233
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
the land,

234
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
for the

235
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
Gentiles who

236
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,
shall possess the land.

237
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
20 But

238
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
behold, it

239
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
shall come

240
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
to pass

241
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
that they

242
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
shall be

243
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
driven and

244
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
scattered by

245
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
the

246
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
Gentiles; and

247
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
after they

248
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
have been

249
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
driven and

250
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
scattered

251
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
by the

252
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
Gentiles,

253
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
behold, then

254
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
will the

255
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
Lord

256
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
remember the

257
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
covenant

258
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
which he made

259
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
unto

260
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
Abraham and

261
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,
unto all the house of Israel.

262
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
21 And

263
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
also the

264
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
Lord will

265
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
remember

266
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
the

267
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
prayers of the

268
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0


269
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
righteous, which

270
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
have been

271
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
put up

272
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,
unto him for them.

273
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
22 And

274
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
then, O

275
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
ye

276
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
Gentiles, how

277
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
can ye

278
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
stand

279
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
before the

280
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
power of

281
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
God,

282
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
except ye

283
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
shall

284
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
repent and

285
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
turn

286
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,
from your evil ways?

287
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
23 Know

288
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
ye not

289
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
that

290
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
ye are

291
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
in the

292
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
hands of

293
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
God?

294
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
Know ye

295
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
not

296
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
that he

297
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
hath all

298
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
power,

299
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
and at

300
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
his

301
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
great

302
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
command the

303
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
earth

304
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
shall

305
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
be

306
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,
rolled together as a scroll?

307
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
24

308
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
Therefore,

309
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
repent

310
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
ye, and

311
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
humble

312
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0


313
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
yourselves

314
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
before

315
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
him, lest

316
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
he

317
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
shall come

318
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
out in

319
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0


320
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
justice

321
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
against

322
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
you—lest a

323
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
remnant

324
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
of the

325
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
seed

326
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
of Jacob

327
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
shall

328
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
go

329
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
forth among

330
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
you as

331
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
a

332
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
lion, and

333
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
tear you

334
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
in

335
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
pieces,

336
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
and there

337
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
is

338
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
none to

339
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,
deliver.
