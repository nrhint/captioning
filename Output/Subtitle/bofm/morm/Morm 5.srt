00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,625
Chapter 5 Mormon again leads the Nephite

2
00:00:01,625 --> 00:00:03,25
armies in battles of blood and carnage—The Book

3
00:00:03,25 --> 00:00:04,875
of Mormon will come forth to convince all

4
00:00:04,875 --> 00:00:06,5
Israel that Jesus is the Christ—Because of

5
00:00:06,5 --> 00:00:08,125
their unbelief, the Lamanites will be

6
00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:09,75
scattered, and the Spirit will cease to strive with

7
00:00:09,75 --> 00:00:11,375
them—They will receive the gospel from the

8
00:00:11,375 --> 00:00:13,38
Gentiles in the latter days. About A.D. 375–84. 

9
00:00:13,38 --> 00:00:19,094
1 And it came to pass that I did go

10
00:00:19,094 --> 00:00:24,808
forth among the Nephites, and did repent

11
00:00:24,808 --> 00:00:30,522
of the oath which I had made that I

12
00:00:30,522 --> 00:00:36,236
would no more assist them; and they

13
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:41,95
gave me command again of their armies,

14
00:00:41,95 --> 00:00:47,664
for they looked upon me as though I

15
00:00:47,664 --> 00:00:53,72
could deliver them from their afflictions.

16
00:00:53,72 --> 00:00:54,22
2 But behold, I was without hope, for

17
00:00:54,22 --> 00:00:54,72
I knew the judgments of the Lord

18
00:00:54,72 --> 00:00:55,22
which should come upon them; for they

19
00:00:55,22 --> 00:00:55,72
repented not of their iniquities, but

20
00:00:55,72 --> 00:00:56,22
did struggle for their lives without

21
00:00:56,22 --> 00:00:56,123
calling upon that Being who created them.

22
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:55,923
3 And it came to pass that the

23
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:55,723
Lamanites did come against us as we had

24
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:55,523
fled to the city of Jordan; but

25
00:00:55,523 --> 00:00:55,323
behold, they were driven back that

26
00:00:55,323 --> 00:00:55,656
they did not take the city at that time.

27
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:55,767
4 And it came to pass that they

28
00:00:55,767 --> 00:00:55,878
came against us again, and we

29
00:00:55,878 --> 00:00:55,989
did maintain the city. And there

30
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:56,1
were also other cities which were

31
00:00:56,1 --> 00:00:56,211
maintained by the Nephites,

32
00:00:56,211 --> 00:00:56,322
which strongholds did cut them off

33
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:56,433
that they could not get into the

34
00:00:56,433 --> 00:00:56,544
country which lay before us, to

35
00:00:56,544 --> 00:00:56,657
destroy the inhabitants of our land.

36
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:57,213
5 But it came to pass that

37
00:00:57,213 --> 00:00:57,769
whatsoever lands we had passed

38
00:00:57,769 --> 00:00:58,325
by, and the inhabitants thereof

39
00:00:58,325 --> 00:00:58,881
were not gathered in, were

40
00:00:58,881 --> 00:00:59,437
destroyed by the Lamanites, and

41
00:00:59,437 --> 00:00:59,993
their towns, and villages, and

42
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:00,549
cities were burned with fire;

43
00:01:00,549 --> 00:01:01,105
and thus three hundred and

44
00:01:01,105 --> 00:01:01,061
seventy and nine years passed away.

45
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:04,161
6 And it came to pass that

46
00:01:04,161 --> 00:01:07,261
in the three hundred and

47
00:01:07,261 --> 00:01:10,361
eightieth year the Lamanites

48
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:13,461
did come again against us

49
00:01:13,461 --> 00:01:16,561
to battle, and we did stand

50
00:01:16,561 --> 00:01:19,661
against them boldly; but it

51
00:01:19,661 --> 00:01:22,761
was all in vain, for so

52
00:01:22,761 --> 00:01:25,861
great were their numbers that

53
00:01:25,861 --> 00:01:28,961
they did tread the people

54
00:01:28,961 --> 00:01:32,025
of the Nephites under their feet.

55
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:33,65
7 And it came to pass

56
00:01:33,65 --> 00:01:35,275
that we did again take to

57
00:01:35,275 --> 00:01:36,9
flight, and those whose

58
00:01:36,9 --> 00:01:38,525
flight was swifter than the

59
00:01:38,525 --> 00:01:40,15
Lamanites’ did escape,

60
00:01:40,15 --> 00:01:41,775
and those whose flight did

61
00:01:41,775 --> 00:01:43,4
not exceed the Lamanites’

62
00:01:43,4 --> 00:01:45,839
were swept down and destroyed.

63
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:45,756
8 And now behold, I,

64
00:01:45,756 --> 00:01:45,673
Mormon, do not desire to

65
00:01:45,673 --> 00:01:45,59
harrow up the souls of men

66
00:01:45,59 --> 00:01:45,507
in casting before them

67
00:01:45,507 --> 00:01:45,424
such an awful scene of

68
00:01:45,424 --> 00:01:45,341
blood and carnage as was

69
00:01:45,341 --> 00:01:45,258
laid before mine eyes;

70
00:01:45,258 --> 00:01:45,175
but I, knowing that these

71
00:01:45,175 --> 00:01:45,092
things must surely be

72
00:01:45,092 --> 00:01:45,009
made known, and that all

73
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:44,926
things which are hid

74
00:01:44,926 --> 00:01:44,905
must be revealed upon the house-tops—

75
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:45,455
9 And also that a

76
00:01:45,455 --> 00:01:46,005
knowledge of these things

77
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:46,555
must come unto the

78
00:01:46,555 --> 00:01:47,105
remnant of these people, and

79
00:01:47,105 --> 00:01:47,655
also unto the Gentiles,

80
00:01:47,655 --> 00:01:48,205
who the Lord hath said

81
00:01:48,205 --> 00:01:48,755
should scatter this

82
00:01:48,755 --> 00:01:49,305
people, and this people

83
00:01:49,305 --> 00:01:49,855
should be counted as

84
00:01:49,855 --> 00:01:50,405
naught among

85
00:01:50,405 --> 00:01:50,955
them—therefore I write a small

86
00:01:50,955 --> 00:01:51,505
abridgment, daring not to

87
00:01:51,505 --> 00:01:52,055
give a full account of

88
00:01:52,055 --> 00:01:52,605
the things which I have

89
00:01:52,605 --> 00:01:53,155
seen, because of the

90
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:53,705
commandment which I have

91
00:01:53,705 --> 00:01:54,255
received, and also that

92
00:01:54,255 --> 00:01:54,805
ye might not have too

93
00:01:54,805 --> 00:01:55,355
great sorrow because of

94
00:01:55,355 --> 00:01:55,282
the wickedness of this people.

95
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:55,157
10 And now behold,

96
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:55,032
this I speak unto their

97
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:54,907
seed, and also to

98
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:54,782
the Gentiles who have

99
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:54,657
care for the house of

100
00:01:54,657 --> 00:01:54,532
Israel, that realize

101
00:01:54,532 --> 00:01:54,407
and know from whence

102
00:01:54,407 --> 00:01:54,348
their blessings come.

103
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:54,265
11 For I know that

104
00:01:54,265 --> 00:01:54,182
such will sorrow for

105
00:01:54,182 --> 00:01:54,099
the calamity of the

106
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:54,016
house of Israel;

107
00:01:54,016 --> 00:01:53,933
yea, they will sorrow

108
00:01:53,933 --> 00:01:53,85
for the destruction

109
00:01:53,85 --> 00:01:53,767
of this people; they

110
00:01:53,767 --> 00:01:53,684
will sorrow that

111
00:01:53,684 --> 00:01:53,601
this people had not

112
00:01:53,601 --> 00:01:53,518
repented that they

113
00:01:53,518 --> 00:01:53,435
might have been clasped

114
00:01:53,435 --> 00:01:53,413
in the arms of Jesus.

115
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:53,342
12 Now these things

116
00:01:53,342 --> 00:01:53,271
are written unto

117
00:01:53,271 --> 00:01:53,2
the remnant of the

118
00:01:53,2 --> 00:01:53,129
house of Jacob; and

119
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:53,058
they are written

120
00:01:53,058 --> 00:01:52,987
after this manner,

121
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:52,916
because it is known

122
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:52,845
of God that

123
00:01:52,845 --> 00:01:52,774
wickedness will not bring

124
00:01:52,774 --> 00:01:52,703
them forth unto

125
00:01:52,703 --> 00:01:52,632
them; and they are to

126
00:01:52,632 --> 00:01:52,561
be hid up unto the

127
00:01:52,561 --> 00:01:52,49
Lord that they may

128
00:01:52,49 --> 00:01:52,479
come forth in his own due time.

129
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,59
13 And this is the

130
00:01:53,59 --> 00:01:54,701
commandment which

131
00:01:54,701 --> 00:01:55,812
I have received;

132
00:01:55,812 --> 00:01:56,923
and behold, they

133
00:01:56,923 --> 00:01:58,034
shall come forth

134
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,145
according to the

135
00:01:59,145 --> 00:02:00,256
commandment of the

136
00:02:00,256 --> 00:02:01,367
Lord, when he shall

137
00:02:01,367 --> 00:02:02,823
see fit, in his wisdom.

138
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:03,448
14 And behold,

139
00:02:03,448 --> 00:02:04,073
they shall go unto

140
00:02:04,073 --> 00:02:04,698
the unbelieving

141
00:02:04,698 --> 00:02:05,323
of the Jews; and

142
00:02:05,323 --> 00:02:05,948
for this intent

143
00:02:05,948 --> 00:02:06,573
shall they go—that

144
00:02:06,573 --> 00:02:07,198
they may be

145
00:02:07,198 --> 00:02:07,823
persuaded that Jesus

146
00:02:07,823 --> 00:02:08,448
is the Christ, the

147
00:02:08,448 --> 00:02:09,073
Son of the

148
00:02:09,073 --> 00:02:09,698
living God; that the

149
00:02:09,698 --> 00:02:10,323
Father may bring

150
00:02:10,323 --> 00:02:10,948
about, through his

151
00:02:10,948 --> 00:02:11,573
most Beloved,

152
00:02:11,573 --> 00:02:12,198
his great and

153
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:12,823
eternal purpose, in

154
00:02:12,823 --> 00:02:13,448
restoring the Jews,

155
00:02:13,448 --> 00:02:14,073
or all the house

156
00:02:14,073 --> 00:02:14,698
of Israel, to

157
00:02:14,698 --> 00:02:15,323
the land of their

158
00:02:15,323 --> 00:02:15,948
inheritance, which

159
00:02:15,948 --> 00:02:16,573
the Lord their

160
00:02:16,573 --> 00:02:17,198
God hath given

161
00:02:17,198 --> 00:02:17,104
them, unto the fulfilling of his covenant;

162
00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:17,539
15 And also that

163
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:17,974
the seed of

164
00:02:17,974 --> 00:02:18,409
this people may

165
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:18,844
more fully believe

166
00:02:18,844 --> 00:02:19,279
his gospel,

167
00:02:19,279 --> 00:02:19,714
which shall go forth

168
00:02:19,714 --> 00:02:20,149
unto them from

169
00:02:20,149 --> 00:02:20,584
the Gentiles;

170
00:02:20,584 --> 00:02:21,019
for this people

171
00:02:21,019 --> 00:02:21,454
shall be

172
00:02:21,454 --> 00:02:21,889
scattered, and shall

173
00:02:21,889 --> 00:02:22,324
become a dark, a

174
00:02:22,324 --> 00:02:22,759
filthy, and a

175
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,194
loathsome people,

176
00:02:23,194 --> 00:02:23,629
beyond the

177
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:24,064
description of that

178
00:02:24,064 --> 00:02:24,499
which ever hath been

179
00:02:24,499 --> 00:02:24,934
amongst us,

180
00:02:24,934 --> 00:02:25,369
yea, even that

181
00:02:25,369 --> 00:02:25,804
which hath been

182
00:02:25,804 --> 00:02:26,239
among the Lamanites,

183
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:26,674
and this

184
00:02:26,674 --> 00:02:27,014
because of their unbelief and idolatry.

185
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:28,847
16 For behold,

186
00:02:28,847 --> 00:02:30,68
the Spirit of

187
00:02:30,68 --> 00:02:32,513
the Lord hath

188
00:02:32,513 --> 00:02:34,346
already ceased to

189
00:02:34,346 --> 00:02:36,179
strive with

190
00:02:36,179 --> 00:02:38,012
their fathers;

191
00:02:38,012 --> 00:02:39,845
and they are

192
00:02:39,845 --> 00:02:41,678
without Christ and

193
00:02:41,678 --> 00:02:43,511
God in the

194
00:02:43,511 --> 00:02:45,344
world; and they are

195
00:02:45,344 --> 00:02:47,177
driven about

196
00:02:47,177 --> 00:02:49,269
as chaff before the wind.

197
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:50,825
17 They were

198
00:02:50,825 --> 00:02:52,381
once a

199
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:53,937
delightsome people,

200
00:02:53,937 --> 00:02:55,493
and they had

201
00:02:55,493 --> 00:02:57,049
Christ for

202
00:02:57,049 --> 00:02:58,605
their

203
00:02:58,605 --> 00:03:00,161
shepherd; yea, they

204
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:01,717
were led even

205
00:03:01,717 --> 00:03:03,583
by God the Father.

206
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,583
18 But now,

207
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,583
behold, they

208
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:09,583
are led

209
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:11,583
about by Satan,

210
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:13,583
even as

211
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,583
chaff is driven

212
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:17,583
before the

213
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,583
wind, or as

214
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,583
a vessel is

215
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,583
tossed about

216
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,583
upon the

217
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:27,583
waves, without

218
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,583
sail or

219
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,583
anchor, or

220
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:33,583
without anything

221
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,583
wherewith

222
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,583
to steer her;

223
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,583
and even as

224
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,788
she is, so are they.

225
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:44,205
19 And

226
00:03:44,205 --> 00:03:46,622
behold, the

227
00:03:46,622 --> 00:03:49,039
Lord hath

228
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:51,456
reserved their

229
00:03:51,456 --> 00:03:53,873
blessings,

230
00:03:53,873 --> 00:03:56,29
which they

231
00:03:56,29 --> 00:03:58,707
might have

232
00:03:58,707 --> 00:04:01,124
received in

233
00:04:01,124 --> 00:04:03,541
the land,

234
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,958
for the

235
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:08,375
Gentiles who

236
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,117
shall possess the land.

237
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:10,077
20 But

238
00:04:10,077 --> 00:04:10,037
behold, it

239
00:04:10,037 --> 00:04:09,997
shall come

240
00:04:09,997 --> 00:04:09,957
to pass

241
00:04:09,957 --> 00:04:09,917
that they

242
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:09,877
shall be

243
00:04:09,877 --> 00:04:09,837
driven and

244
00:04:09,837 --> 00:04:09,797
scattered by

245
00:04:09,797 --> 00:04:09,757
the

246
00:04:09,757 --> 00:04:09,717
Gentiles; and

247
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:09,677
after they

248
00:04:09,677 --> 00:04:09,637
have been

249
00:04:09,637 --> 00:04:09,597
driven and

250
00:04:09,597 --> 00:04:09,557
scattered

251
00:04:09,557 --> 00:04:09,517
by the

252
00:04:09,517 --> 00:04:09,477
Gentiles,

253
00:04:09,477 --> 00:04:09,437
behold, then

254
00:04:09,437 --> 00:04:09,397
will the

255
00:04:09,397 --> 00:04:09,357
Lord

256
00:04:09,357 --> 00:04:09,317
remember the

257
00:04:09,317 --> 00:04:09,277
covenant

258
00:04:09,277 --> 00:04:09,237
which he made

259
00:04:09,237 --> 00:04:09,197
unto

260
00:04:09,197 --> 00:04:09,157
Abraham and

261
00:04:09,157 --> 00:04:09,182
unto all the house of Israel.

262
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:09,091
21 And

263
00:04:09,091 --> 00:04:09,0
also the

264
00:04:09,0 --> 00:04:08,909
Lord will

265
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:08,818
remember

266
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:08,727
the

267
00:04:08,727 --> 00:04:08,636
prayers of the

268
00:04:08,636 --> 00:04:08,545


269
00:04:08,545 --> 00:04:08,454
righteous, which

270
00:04:08,454 --> 00:04:08,363
have been

271
00:04:08,363 --> 00:04:08,272
put up

272
00:04:08,272 --> 00:04:08,248
unto him for them.

273
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:08,391
22 And

274
00:04:08,391 --> 00:04:08,534
then, O

275
00:04:08,534 --> 00:04:08,677
ye

276
00:04:08,677 --> 00:04:08,82
Gentiles, how

277
00:04:08,82 --> 00:04:08,963
can ye

278
00:04:08,963 --> 00:04:09,106
stand

279
00:04:09,106 --> 00:04:09,249
before the

280
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:09,392
power of

281
00:04:09,392 --> 00:04:09,535
God,

282
00:04:09,535 --> 00:04:09,678
except ye

283
00:04:09,678 --> 00:04:09,821
shall

284
00:04:09,821 --> 00:04:09,964
repent and

285
00:04:09,964 --> 00:04:10,107
turn

286
00:04:10,107 --> 00:04:10,65
from your evil ways?

287
00:04:10,65 --> 00:04:10,7
23 Know

288
00:04:10,7 --> 00:04:10,75
ye not

289
00:04:10,75 --> 00:04:10,8
that

290
00:04:10,8 --> 00:04:10,85
ye are

291
00:04:10,85 --> 00:04:10,9
in the

292
00:04:10,9 --> 00:04:10,95
hands of

293
00:04:10,95 --> 00:04:11,0
God?

294
00:04:11,0 --> 00:04:11,05
Know ye

295
00:04:11,05 --> 00:04:11,1
not

296
00:04:11,1 --> 00:04:11,15
that he

297
00:04:11,15 --> 00:04:11,2
hath all

298
00:04:11,2 --> 00:04:11,25
power,

299
00:04:11,25 --> 00:04:11,3
and at

300
00:04:11,3 --> 00:04:11,35
his

301
00:04:11,35 --> 00:04:11,4
great

302
00:04:11,4 --> 00:04:11,45
command the

303
00:04:11,45 --> 00:04:11,5
earth

304
00:04:11,5 --> 00:04:11,55
shall

305
00:04:11,55 --> 00:04:11,6
be

306
00:04:11,6 --> 00:04:11,118
rolled together as a scroll?

307
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:11,118
24

308
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:11,118
Therefore,

309
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:11,118
repent

310
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:11,118
ye, and

311
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:11,118
humble

312
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:11,118


313
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:11,118
yourselves

314
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:11,118
before

315
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:11,118
him, lest

316
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:11,118
he

317
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:11,118
shall come

318
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:11,118
out in

319
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:11,118


320
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:11,118
justice

321
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:11,118
against

322
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:11,118
you—lest a

323
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:11,118
remnant

324
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:11,118
of the

325
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:11,118
seed

326
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:11,118
of Jacob

327
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:11,118
shall

328
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:11,118
go

329
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:11,118
forth among

330
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:11,118
you as

331
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:11,118
a

332
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:11,118
lion, and

333
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:11,118
tear you

334
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:11,118
in

335
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:11,118
pieces,

336
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:11,118
and there

337
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:11,118
is

338
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:11,118
none to

339
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:11,585
deliver.
