00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,875
Chapter 5 Mormon again leads the Nephite armies in

2
00:00:00,875 --> 00:00:01,75
 battles of blood and carnage—The Book of Mormon

3
00:00:01,75 --> 00:00:02,625
 will come forth to convince all Israel that Jesus

4
00:00:02,625 --> 00:00:03,5
 is the Christ—Because of their unbelief, the

5
00:00:03,5 --> 00:00:04,375
 Lamanites will be scattered, and the Spirit will cease

6
00:00:04,375 --> 00:00:05,25
 to strive with them—They will receive the gospel

7
00:00:05,25 --> 00:00:06,125
 from the Gentiles in the latter days. About

8
00:00:06,125 --> 00:00:07,0
 A.D. 375–84.

9
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:11,975
1 And it came to pass that I did go forth among

10
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:15,975
 the Nephites, and did repent of the oath which I had

11
00:00:15,975 --> 00:00:19,975
 made that I would no more assist them; and they

12
00:00:19,975 --> 00:00:23,975
 gave me command again of their armies, for they

13
00:00:23,975 --> 00:00:27,975
 looked upon me as though I could deliver them from

14
00:00:27,975 --> 00:00:31,975
 their afflictions

15
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:35,099
2 But behold, I was without hope, for I knew the

16
00:00:35,099 --> 00:00:38,299
 judgments of the Lord which should come upon them;

17
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:41,499
 for they repented not of their iniquities, but did

18
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:44,699
 struggle for their lives without calling upon

19
00:00:44,699 --> 00:00:47,899
 that Being who created them

20
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:51,848
3 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did come

21
00:00:51,848 --> 00:00:55,848
 against us as we had fled to the city of Jordan;

22
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:59,848
 but behold, they were driven back that they did not

23
00:00:59,848 --> 00:01:03,848
 take the city at that time

24
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,13
4 And it came to pass that they came against us

25
00:01:05,13 --> 00:01:06,463
 again, and we did maintain the city. And there were

26
00:01:06,463 --> 00:01:07,796
 also other cities which were maintained by the

27
00:01:07,796 --> 00:01:09,129
 Nephites, which strongholds did cut them off that

28
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:10,462
 they could not get into the country which lay before

29
00:01:10,462 --> 00:01:11,795
 us, to destroy the inhabitants of our land

30
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:13,105
5 But it came to pass that whatsoever lands we had

31
00:01:13,105 --> 00:01:14,438
 passed by, and the inhabitants thereof were not

32
00:01:14,438 --> 00:01:15,771
 gathered in, were destroyed by the Lamanites, and

33
00:01:15,771 --> 00:01:17,104
 their towns, and villages, and cities were burned

34
00:01:17,104 --> 00:01:18,437
 with fire; and thus three hundred and seventy and

35
00:01:18,437 --> 00:01:19,77
 nine years passed away

36
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,079
6 And it came to pass that in the three hundred

37
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:22,412
 and eightieth year the Lamanites did come again

38
00:01:22,412 --> 00:01:23,745
 against us to battle, and we did stand against them

39
00:01:23,745 --> 00:01:25,078
 boldly; but it was all in vain, for so great were

40
00:01:25,078 --> 00:01:26,411
 their numbers that they did tread the people of the

41
00:01:26,411 --> 00:01:27,744
 Nephites under their feet

42
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:29,321
7 And it came to pass that we did again take to

43
00:01:29,321 --> 00:01:30,921
 flight, and those whose flight was swifter than the

44
00:01:30,921 --> 00:01:32,521
 Lamanites’ did escape, and those whose flight did

45
00:01:32,521 --> 00:01:34,121
 not exceed the Lamanites’ were swept down and

46
00:01:34,121 --> 00:01:35,721
 destroyed

47
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,029
8 And now behold, I, Mormon, do not desire to

48
00:01:37,029 --> 00:01:38,362
 harrow up the souls of men in casting before them such

49
00:01:38,362 --> 00:01:39,695
 an awful scene of blood and carnage as was laid

50
00:01:39,695 --> 00:01:41,028
 before mine eyes; but I, knowing that these things

51
00:01:41,028 --> 00:01:42,361
 must surely be made known, and that all things

52
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:43,694
 which are hid must be revealed upon the house-tops

53
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:44,47
9 And also that a knowledge of these things must

54
00:01:44,47 --> 00:01:45,27
 come unto the remnant of these people, and also

55
00:01:45,27 --> 00:01:46,07
 unto the Gentiles, who the Lord hath said should

56
00:01:46,07 --> 00:01:46,87
 scatter this people, and this people should be counted

57
00:01:46,87 --> 00:01:47,67
 as naught among them—therefore I write a small

58
00:01:47,67 --> 00:01:48,47
 abridgment, daring not to give a full account of the

59
00:01:48,47 --> 00:01:49,27
 things which I have seen, because of the

60
00:01:49,27 --> 00:01:50,07
 commandment which I have received, and also that ye might

61
00:01:50,07 --> 00:01:50,87
 not have too great sorrow because of the

62
00:01:50,87 --> 00:01:51,67
 wickedness of this people

63
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:55,645
10 And now behold, this I speak unto their seed,

64
00:01:55,645 --> 00:01:59,645
 and also to the Gentiles who have care for the

65
00:01:59,645 --> 00:02:03,645
 house of Israel, that realize and know from whence

66
00:02:03,645 --> 00:02:07,645
 their blessings come

67
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,194
11 For I know that such will sorrow for the

68
00:02:09,194 --> 00:02:10,794
 calamity of the house of Israel; yea, they will sorrow

69
00:02:10,794 --> 00:02:12,394
 for the destruction of this people; they will

70
00:02:12,394 --> 00:02:13,994
 sorrow that this people had not repented that they

71
00:02:13,994 --> 00:02:15,594
 might have been clasped in the arms of Jesus

72
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:16,902
12 Now these things are written unto the remnant

73
00:02:16,902 --> 00:02:18,235
 of the house of Jacob; and they are written after

74
00:02:18,235 --> 00:02:19,568
 this manner, because it is known of God that

75
00:02:19,568 --> 00:02:20,901
 wickedness will not bring them forth unto them; and they

76
00:02:20,901 --> 00:02:22,234
 are to be hid up unto the Lord that they may come

77
00:02:22,234 --> 00:02:23,567
 forth in his own due time

78
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,543
13 And this is the commandment which I have

79
00:02:25,543 --> 00:02:27,543
 received; and behold, they shall come forth according to

80
00:02:27,543 --> 00:02:29,543
 the commandment of the Lord, when he shall see

81
00:02:29,543 --> 00:02:31,543
 fit, in his wisdom

82
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:32,407
14 And behold, they shall go unto the unbelieving

83
00:02:32,407 --> 00:02:33,296
 of the Jews; and for this intent shall they

84
00:02:33,296 --> 00:02:34,185
 go—that they may be persuaded that Jesus is the Christ,

85
00:02:34,185 --> 00:02:35,074
 the Son of the living God; that the Father may

86
00:02:35,074 --> 00:02:35,963
 bring about, through his most Beloved, his great and

87
00:02:35,963 --> 00:02:36,852
 eternal purpose, in restoring the Jews, or all the

88
00:02:36,852 --> 00:02:37,741
 house of Israel, to the land of their

89
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:38,63
 inheritance, which the Lord their God hath given them, unto

90
00:02:38,63 --> 00:02:39,519
 the fulfilling of his covenant

91
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:40,493
15 And also that the seed of this people may more

92
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,493
 fully believe his gospel, which shall go forth

93
00:02:41,493 --> 00:02:42,493
 unto them from the Gentiles; for this people shall be

94
00:02:42,493 --> 00:02:43,493
 scattered, and shall become a dark, a filthy, and

95
00:02:43,493 --> 00:02:44,493
 a loathsome people, beyond the description of

96
00:02:44,493 --> 00:02:45,493
 that which ever hath been amongst us, yea, even that

97
00:02:45,493 --> 00:02:46,493
 which hath been among the Lamanites, and this

98
00:02:46,493 --> 00:02:47,493
 because of their unbelief and idolatry

99
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,467
16 For behold, the Spirit of the Lord hath already

100
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:51,467
 ceased to strive with their fathers; and they are

101
00:02:51,467 --> 00:02:53,467
 without Christ and God in the world; and they are

102
00:02:53,467 --> 00:02:55,467
 driven about as chaff before the wind

103
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:58,109
17 They were once a delightsome people, and they

104
00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:00,776
 had Christ for their shepherd; yea, they were led

105
00:03:00,776 --> 00:03:03,443
 even by God the Father

106
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,017
18 But now, behold, they are led about by Satan,

107
00:03:05,017 --> 00:03:06,617
 even as chaff is driven before the wind, or as a

108
00:03:06,617 --> 00:03:08,217
 vessel is tossed about upon the waves, without sail

109
00:03:08,217 --> 00:03:09,817
 or anchor, or without anything wherewith to steer

110
00:03:09,817 --> 00:03:11,417
 her; and even as she is, so are they

111
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:14,058
19 And behold, the Lord hath reserved their

112
00:03:14,058 --> 00:03:16,725
 blessings, which they might have received in the land,

113
00:03:16,725 --> 00:03:19,392
 for the Gentiles who shall possess the land

114
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,699
20 But behold, it shall come to pass that they

115
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:22,032
 shall be driven and scattered by the Gentiles; and

116
00:03:22,032 --> 00:03:23,365
 after they have been driven and scattered by the

117
00:03:23,365 --> 00:03:24,698
 Gentiles, behold, then will the Lord remember the

118
00:03:24,698 --> 00:03:26,031
 covenant which he made unto Abraham and unto all the

119
00:03:26,031 --> 00:03:27,364
 house of Israel

120
00:03:27,34 --> 00:03:32,673
21 And also the Lord will remember the prayers of

121
00:03:32,673 --> 00:03:38,006
 the righteous, which have been put up unto him for

122
00:03:38,006 --> 00:03:43,339
 them

123
00:03:43,29 --> 00:03:45,957
22 And then, O ye Gentiles, how can ye stand

124
00:03:45,957 --> 00:03:48,624
 before the power of God, except ye shall repent and

125
00:03:48,624 --> 00:03:51,291
 turn from your evil ways

126
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,264
23 Know ye not that ye are in the hands of God?

127
00:03:53,264 --> 00:03:55,264
 Know ye not that he hath all power, and at his great

128
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,264
 command the earth shall be rolled together as a

129
00:03:57,264 --> 00:03:59,264
 scroll

130
00:03:59,239 --> 00:03:59,439
24 Therefore, repent ye, and humble yourselves

131
00:03:59,439 --> 00:03:59,639
 before him, lest he shall come out in justice against

132
00:03:59,639 --> 00:03:59,839
 you—lest a remnant of the seed of Jacob shall go

133
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:00,039
 forth among you as a lion, and tear you in pieces,

134
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:00,239
 and there is none to deliver.
