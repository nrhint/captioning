00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 8 The Lamanites seek out and

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
destroy the Nephites—The Book of Mormon will come

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
forth by the power of God—Woes pronounced

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
upon those who breathe out wrath and strife

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
against the work of the Lord—The Nephite

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
record will come forth in a day of

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:18:52,
wickedness, degeneracy, and apostasy. About A.D. 400–421. 

8
00:18:52,0 --> 00:18:52,0
1 Behold I, Moroni, do finish the

9
00:18:52,0 --> 00:18:52,0
record of my father, Mormon. Behold, I

10
00:18:52,0 --> 00:18:52,0
have but few things to write, which

11
00:18:52,0 --> 00:22:51,
things I have been commanded by my father.

12
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
2 And now it came to pass that

13
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
after the great and tremendous battle

14
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
at Cumorah, behold, the Nephites

15
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
who had escaped into the country

16
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
southward were hunted by the

17
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,
Lamanites, until they were all destroyed.

18
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
3 And my father also was killed

19
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
by them, and I even remain alone

20
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
to write the sad tale of the

21
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
destruction of my people. But behold,

22
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
they are gone, and I fulfil the

23
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
commandment of my father. And

24
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,
whether they will slay me, I know not.

25
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
4 Therefore I will write and

26
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
hide up the records in the earth;

27
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,
and whither I go it mattereth not.

28
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
5 Behold, my father hath made

29
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
this record, and he hath

30
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
written the intent thereof. And

31
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
behold, I would write it also if

32
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
I had room upon the plates,

33
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
but I have not; and ore I have

34
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
none, for I am alone. My father

35
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
hath been slain in battle,

36
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
and all my kinsfolk, and I have

37
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
not friends nor whither to go;

38
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
and how long the Lord will

39
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,
suffer that I may live I know not.

40
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
6 Behold, four hundred years

41
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
have passed away since the

42
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,
coming of our Lord and Savior.

43
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
7 And behold, the Lamanites

44
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
have hunted my people, the

45
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
Nephites, down from city

46
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
to city and from place to

47
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
place, even until they are no

48
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
more; and great has been

49
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
their fall; yea, great and

50
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
marvelous is the destruction

51
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,
of my people, the Nephites.

52
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
8 And behold, it is the

53
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
hand of the Lord which hath

54
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
done it. And behold also,

55
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
the Lamanites are at war

56
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
one with another; and the

57
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
whole face of this land is

58
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
one continual round of

59
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
murder and bloodshed; and no

60
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,
one knoweth the end of the war.

61
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
9 And now, behold, I say

62
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
no more concerning

63
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
them, for there are none

64
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
save it be the Lamanites

65
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
and robbers that do exist

66
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,
upon the face of the land.

67
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
10 And there are none

68
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
that do know the true

69
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
God save it be the

70
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
disciples of Jesus, who did

71
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
tarry in the land until

72
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
the wickedness of the

73
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
people was so great that

74
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
the Lord would not

75
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
suffer them to remain with

76
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
the people; and

77
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
whether they be upon the face

78
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,
of the land no man knoweth.

79
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
11 But behold, my

80
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
father and I have seen

81
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
them, and they have

82
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,
ministered unto us.

83
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
12 And whoso

84
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
receiveth this record,

85
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
and shall not condemn

86
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
it because of the

87
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
imperfections which

88
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
are in it, the

89
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
same shall know of

90
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
greater things than

91
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
these. Behold, I am

92
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
Moroni; and were it

93
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
possible, I would

94
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,
make all things known unto you.

95
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
13 Behold, I make

96
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
an end of

97
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
speaking concerning

98
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
this people. I am

99
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
the son of Mormon,

100
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
and my father was

101
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,
a descendant of Nephi.

102
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
14 And I am the

103
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
same who hideth

104
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
up this record

105
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
unto the Lord;

106
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
the plates thereof

107
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
are of no

108
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
worth, because of the

109
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
commandment of

110
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
the Lord. For he

111
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
truly saith

112
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
that no one shall

113
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
have them to get

114
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
gain; but the

115
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
record thereof is

116
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
of great worth;

117
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
and whoso shall

118
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
bring it to

119
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,
light, him will the Lord bless.

120
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
15 For none can

121
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
have power to

122
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
bring it to

123
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
light save it be

124
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
given him of

125
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
God; for God wills

126
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
that it shall

127
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
be done with an

128
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
eye single to

129
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
his glory, or

130
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
the welfare of

131
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
the ancient and

132
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
long dispersed

133
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,
covenant people of the Lord.

134
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
16 And blessed

135
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
be he that

136
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
shall bring this

137
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
thing to

138
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
light; for it

139
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
shall be brought

140
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
out of darkness

141
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
unto light,

142
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
according to

143
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
the word of God;

144
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
yea, it shall

145
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
be brought

146
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
out of the

147
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
earth, and it shall

148
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
shine forth

149
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
out of

150
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
darkness, and come

151
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
unto the

152
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
knowledge of the

153
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
people; and it

154
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,
shall be done by the power of God.

155
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
17 And if

156
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
there be faults

157
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
they be the

158
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
faults of a man.

159
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
But behold, we

160
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
know no fault;

161
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
nevertheless

162
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
God knoweth

163
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
all things;

164
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
therefore, he that

165
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
condemneth,

166
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
let him be

167
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
aware lest he

168
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
shall be in danger

169
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,
of hell fire.

170
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
18 And he

171
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
that saith:

172
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
Show unto me,

173
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
or ye shall

174
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
be

175
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
smitten—let him

176
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
beware lest he

177
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
commandeth

178
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
that which is

179
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,
forbidden of the Lord.

180
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
19 For

181
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
behold, the

182
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
same that

183
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
judgeth rashly

184
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
shall be

185
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
judged rashly

186
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
again; for

187
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
according

188
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
to his

189
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
works shall his

190
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
wages be;

191
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
therefore,

192
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
he that

193
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
smiteth shall

194
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
be smitten

195
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,
again, of the Lord.

196
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
20 Behold

197
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
what the

198
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
scripture

199
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
says—man

200
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
shall not

201
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
smite,

202
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
neither shall

203
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
he judge;

204
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
for

205
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
judgment is mine,

206
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
saith the

207
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
Lord, and

208
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
vengeance

209
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
is mine

210
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,
also, and I will repay.

211
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
21 And he

212
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
that

213
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
shall

214
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
breathe out

215
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
wrath and

216
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
strifes

217
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
against the

218
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
work of

219
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
the Lord,
