Chapter 8 The Lamanites seek out and destroy the

2
00:00:01,0 --> 00:00:02,0
 Nephites—The Book of Mormon will come forth by the

3
00:00:02,0 --> 00:00:03,0
 power of God—Woes pronounced upon those who

4
00:00:03,0 --> 00:00:04,0
 breathe out wrath and strife against the work of the

5
00:00:04,0 --> 00:00:05,0
 Lord—The Nephite record will come forth in a day of

6
00:00:05,0 --> 00:00:06,0
 wickedness, degeneracy, and apostasy. About

7
00:00:06,0 --> 00:00:07,0
 A.D. 400–421.

8
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,975
1 Behold I, Moroni, do finish the record of my

9
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:11,975
 father, Mormon. Behold, I have but few things to

10
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:13,975
 write, which things I have been commanded by my

11
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:15,975
 father

12
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,549
2 And now it came to pass that after the great and

13
00:00:17,549 --> 00:00:19,149
 tremendous battle at Cumorah, behold, the

14
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:20,749
 Nephites who had escaped into the country southward were

15
00:00:20,749 --> 00:00:22,349
 hunted by the Lamanites, until they were all

16
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:23,949
 destroyed

17
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,524
3 And my father also was killed by them, and I

18
00:00:25,524 --> 00:00:27,124
 even remain alone to write the sad tale of the

19
00:00:27,124 --> 00:00:28,724
 destruction of my people. But behold, they are gone, and

20
00:00:28,724 --> 00:00:30,324
 I fulfil the commandment of my father. And

21
00:00:30,324 --> 00:00:31,924
 whether they will slay me, I know not

22
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:35,899
4 Therefore I will write and hide up the records

23
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:39,899
 in the earth; and whither I go it mattereth not

24
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,873
5 Behold, my father hath made this record, and he

25
00:00:41,873 --> 00:00:43,873
 hath written the intent thereof. And behold, I

26
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:45,873
 would write it also if I had room upon the plates,

27
00:00:45,873 --> 00:00:47,873
 but I have not; and ore I have none, for I am alone.

28
00:00:47,873 --> 00:00:49,873
 My father hath been slain in battle, and all my

29
00:00:49,873 --> 00:00:51,873
 kinsfolk, and I have not friends nor whither to go;

30
00:00:51,873 --> 00:00:53,873
 and how long the Lord will suffer that I may live

31
00:00:53,873 --> 00:00:55,873
 I know not

32
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:59,822
6 Behold, four hundred years have passed away

33
00:00:59,822 --> 00:01:03,822
 since the coming of our Lord and Savior

34
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:06,997
7 And behold, the Lamanites have hunted my people,

35
00:01:06,997 --> 00:01:10,197
 the Nephites, down from city to city and from

36
00:01:10,197 --> 00:01:13,397
 place to place, even until they are no more; and

37
00:01:13,397 --> 00:01:16,597
 great has been their fall; yea, great and marvelous is

38
00:01:16,597 --> 00:01:19,797
 the destruction of my people, the Nephites

39
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:27,746
8 And behold, it is the hand of the Lord which

40
00:01:27,746 --> 00:01:35,746
 hath done it. And behold also, the Lamanites are at

41
00:01:35,746 --> 00:01:43,746
 war one with another; and the whole face of this

42
00:01:43,746 --> 00:01:51,746
 land is one continual round of murder and bloodshed;

43
00:01:51,746 --> 00:01:59,746
 and no one knoweth the end of the war

44
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:02,287
9 And now, behold, I say no more concerning them,

45
00:02:02,287 --> 00:02:04,954
 for there are none save it be the Lamanites and

46
00:02:04,954 --> 00:02:07,621
 robbers that do exist upon the face of the land

47
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:08,927
10 And there are none that do know the true God

48
00:02:08,927 --> 00:02:10,26
 save it be the disciples of Jesus, who did tarry in

49
00:02:10,26 --> 00:02:11,593
 the land until the wickedness of the people was so

50
00:02:11,593 --> 00:02:12,926
 great that the Lord would not suffer them to

51
00:02:12,926 --> 00:02:14,259
 remain with the people; and whether they be upon the

52
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,592
 face of the land no man knoweth

53
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:19,569
11 But behold, my father and I have seen them, and

54
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:23,569
 they have ministered unto us

55
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:33,143
12 And whoso receiveth this record, and shall not

56
00:02:33,143 --> 00:02:42,743
 condemn it because of the imperfections which are

57
00:02:42,743 --> 00:02:52,343
 in it, the same shall know of greater things than

58
00:02:52,343 --> 00:03:01,943
 these. Behold, I am Moroni; and were it possible,

59
00:03:01,943 --> 00:03:11,543
 I would make all things known unto you

60
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:16,724
13 Behold, I make an end of speaking concerning

61
00:03:16,724 --> 00:03:22,057
 this people. I am the son of Mormon, and my father

62
00:03:22,057 --> 00:03:27,39
 was a descendant of Nephi

63
00:03:27,34 --> 00:03:28,673
14 And I am the same who hideth up this record

64
00:03:28,673 --> 00:03:30,006
 unto the Lord; the plates thereof are of no worth,

65
00:03:30,006 --> 00:03:31,339
 because of the commandment of the Lord. For he truly

66
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:32,672
 saith that no one shall have them to get gain;

67
00:03:32,672 --> 00:03:34,005
 but the record thereof is of great worth; and whoso

68
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,338
 shall bring it to light, him will the Lord bless

69
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:38,515
15 For none can have power to bring it to light

70
00:03:38,515 --> 00:03:41,715
 save it be given him of God; for God wills that it

71
00:03:41,715 --> 00:03:44,915
 shall be done with an eye single to his glory, or

72
00:03:44,915 --> 00:03:48,115
 the welfare of the ancient and long dispersed

73
00:03:48,115 --> 00:03:51,315
 covenant people of the Lord

74
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:52,407
16 And blessed be he that shall bring this thing

75
00:03:52,407 --> 00:03:53,55
 to light; for it shall be brought out of darkness

76
00:03:53,55 --> 00:03:54,693
 unto light, according to the word of God; yea, it

77
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:55,836
 shall be brought out of the earth, and it shall

78
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:56,979
 shine forth out of darkness, and come unto the

79
00:03:56,979 --> 00:03:58,122
 knowledge of the people; and it shall be done by the

80
00:03:58,122 --> 00:03:59,265
 power of God

81
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,839
17 And if there be faults they be the faults of a

82
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:02,439
 man. But behold, we know no fault; nevertheless

83
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:04,039
 God knoweth all things; therefore, he that

84
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,639
 condemneth, let him be aware lest he shall be in danger of

85
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:07,239
 hell fire

86
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:12,547
18 And he that saith: Show unto me, or ye shall be

87
00:04:12,547 --> 00:04:17,88
 smitten—let him beware lest he commandeth that

88
00:04:17,88 --> 00:04:23,213
 which is forbidden of the Lord

89
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:27,163
19 For behold, the same that judgeth rashly shall

90
00:04:27,163 --> 00:04:31,163
 be judged rashly again; for according to his works

91
00:04:31,163 --> 00:04:35,163
 shall his wages be; therefore, he that smiteth

92
00:04:35,163 --> 00:04:39,163
 shall be smitten again, of the Lord

93
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:43,112
20 Behold what the scripture says—man shall not

94
00:04:43,112 --> 00:04:47,112
 smite, neither shall he judge; for judgment is mine,

95
00:04:47,112 --> 00:04:51,112
 saith the Lord, and vengeance is mine also, and I

96
00:04:51,112 --> 00:04:55,112
 will repay

97
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,061
21 And he that shall breathe out wrath and strifes

98
00:04:57,061 --> 00:04:59,061
 against the work of the Lord, and against the

99
00:04:59,061 --> 00:05:01,061
 covenant people of the Lord who are the house of

100
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:03,061
 Israel, and shall say: We will destroy the work of the

101
00:05:03,061 --> 00:05:05,061
 Lord, and the Lord will not remember his covenant

102
00:05:05,061 --> 00:05:07,061
 which he hath made unto the house of Israel—the

103
00:05:07,061 --> 00:05:09,061
 same is in danger to be hewn down and cast into the

104
00:05:09,061 --> 00:05:11,061
 fire

105
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:14,511
22 For the eternal purposes of the Lord shall roll

106
00:05:14,511 --> 00:05:18,011
 on, until all his promises shall be fulfilled

107
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,128
23 Search the prophecies of Isaiah. Behold, I

108
00:05:20,128 --> 00:05:21,271
 cannot write them. Yea, behold I say unto you, that

109
00:05:21,271 --> 00:05:22,414
 those saints who have gone before me, who have

110
00:05:22,414 --> 00:05:23,557
 possessed this land, shall cry, yea, even from the dust

111
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:24,7
 will they cry unto the Lord; and as the Lord

112
00:05:24,7 --> 00:05:25,843
 liveth he will remember the covenant which he hath

113
00:05:25,843 --> 00:05:26,986
 made with them

114
00:05:26,96 --> 00:05:27,849
24 And he knoweth their prayers, that they were in

115
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:28,738
 behalf of their brethren. And he knoweth their

116
00:05:28,738 --> 00:05:29,627
 faith, for in his name could they remove mountains;

117
00:05:29,627 --> 00:05:30,516
 and in his name could they cause the earth to

118
00:05:30,516 --> 00:05:31,405
 shake; and by the power of his word did they cause

119
00:05:31,405 --> 00:05:32,294
 prisons to tumble to the earth; yea, even the fiery

120
00:05:32,294 --> 00:05:33,183
 furnace could not harm them, neither wild beasts

121
00:05:33,183 --> 00:05:34,072
 nor poisonous serpents, because of the power of his

122
00:05:34,072 --> 00:05:34,961
 word

123
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:37,602
25 And behold, their prayers were also in behalf

124
00:05:37,602 --> 00:05:40,269
 of him that the Lord should suffer to bring these

125
00:05:40,269 --> 00:05:42,936
 things forth

126
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,052
26 And no one need say they shall not come, for

127
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,195
 they surely shall, for the Lord hath spoken it; for

128
00:05:45,195 --> 00:05:46,338
 out of the earth shall they come, by the hand of

129
00:05:46,338 --> 00:05:47,481
 the Lord, and none can stay it; and it shall come

130
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:48,624
 in a day when it shall be said that miracles are

131
00:05:48,624 --> 00:05:49,767
 done away; and it shall come even as if one should

132
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:50,91
 speak from the dead

133
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:53,551
27 And it shall come in a day when the blood of

134
00:05:53,551 --> 00:05:56,218
 saints shall cry unto the Lord, because of secret

135
00:05:56,218 --> 00:05:58,885
 combinations and the works of darkness

136
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,001
28 Yea, it shall come in a day when the power of

137
00:06:00,001 --> 00:06:01,144
 God shall be denied, and churches become defiled

138
00:06:01,144 --> 00:06:02,287
 and be lifted up in the pride of their hearts; yea,

139
00:06:02,287 --> 00:06:03,43
 even in a day when leaders of churches and

140
00:06:03,43 --> 00:06:04,573
 teachers shall rise in the pride of their hearts, even to

141
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:05,716
 the envying of them who belong to their churches

142
00:06:05,716 --> 00:06:06,859


143
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,5
29 Yea, it shall come in a day when there shall be

144
00:06:09,5 --> 00:06:12,167
 heard of fires, and tempests, and vapors of smoke

145
00:06:12,167 --> 00:06:14,834
 in foreign lands

146
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:18,808
30 And there shall also be heard of wars, rumors

147
00:06:18,808 --> 00:06:22,808
 of wars, and earthquakes in divers places

148
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:23,671
31 Yea, it shall come in a day when there shall be

149
00:06:23,671 --> 00:06:24,56
 great pollutions upon the face of the earth;

150
00:06:24,56 --> 00:06:25,449
 there shall be murders, and robbing, and lying, and

151
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:26,338
 deceivings, and whoredoms, and all manner of

152
00:06:26,338 --> 00:06:27,227
 abominations; when there shall be many who will say, Do

153
00:06:27,227 --> 00:06:28,116
 this, or do that, and it mattereth not, for the

154
00:06:28,116 --> 00:06:29,005
 Lord will uphold such at the last day. But wo unto

155
00:06:29,005 --> 00:06:29,894
 such, for they are in the gall of bitterness and in

156
00:06:29,894 --> 00:06:30,783
 the bonds of iniquity

157
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,757
32 Yea, it shall come in a day when there shall be

158
00:06:32,757 --> 00:06:34,757
 churches built up that shall say: Come unto me,

159
00:06:34,757 --> 00:06:36,757
 and for your money you shall be forgiven of your

160
00:06:36,757 --> 00:06:38,757
 sins

161
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:39,875
33 O ye wicked and perverse and stiffnecked

162
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,018
 people, why have ye built up churches unto yourselves to

163
00:06:41,018 --> 00:06:42,161
 get gain? Why have ye transfigured the holy word

164
00:06:42,161 --> 00:06:43,304
 of God, that ye might bring damnation upon your

165
00:06:43,304 --> 00:06:44,447
 souls? Behold, look ye unto the revelations of God;

166
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:45,59
 for behold, the time cometh at that day when all

167
00:06:45,59 --> 00:06:46,733
 these things must be fulfilled

168
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,706
34 Behold, the Lord hath shown unto me great and

169
00:06:48,706 --> 00:06:50,706
 marvelous things concerning that which must shortly

170
00:06:50,706 --> 00:06:52,706
 come, at that day when these things shall come

171
00:06:52,706 --> 00:06:54,706
 forth among you

172
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:57,348
35 Behold, I speak unto you as if ye were present,

173
00:06:57,348 --> 00:07:00,015
 and yet ye are not. But behold, Jesus Christ hath

174
00:07:00,015 --> 00:07:02,682
 shown you unto me, and I know your doing

175
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:03,656
36 And I know that ye do walk in the pride of your

176
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:04,656
 hearts; and there are none save a few only who do

177
00:07:04,656 --> 00:07:05,656
 not lift themselves up in the pride of their

178
00:07:05,656 --> 00:07:06,656
 hearts, unto the wearing of very fine apparel, unto

179
00:07:06,656 --> 00:07:07,656
 envying, and strifes, and malice, and persecutions,

180
00:07:07,656 --> 00:07:08,656
 and all manner of iniquities; and your churches,

181
00:07:08,656 --> 00:07:09,656
 yea, even every one, have become polluted because

182
00:07:09,656 --> 00:07:10,656
 of the pride of your hearts

183
00:07:10,63 --> 00:07:12,63
37 For behold, ye do love money, and your

184
00:07:12,63 --> 00:07:14,63
 substance, and your fine apparel, and the adorning of your

185
00:07:14,63 --> 00:07:16,63
 churches, more than ye love the poor and the

186
00:07:16,63 --> 00:07:18,63
 needy, the sick and the afflicted

187
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:19,748
38 O ye pollutions, ye hypocrites, ye teachers,

188
00:07:19,748 --> 00:07:20,891
 who sell yourselves for that which will canker, why

189
00:07:20,891 --> 00:07:22,034
 have ye polluted the holy church of God? Why are

190
00:07:22,034 --> 00:07:23,177
 ye ashamed to take upon you the name of Christ? Why

191
00:07:23,177 --> 00:07:24,32
 do ye not think that greater is the value of an

192
00:07:24,32 --> 00:07:25,463
 endless happiness than that misery which never

193
00:07:25,463 --> 00:07:26,606
 dies—because of the praise of the world

194
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,579
39 Why do ye adorn yourselves with that which hath

195
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:30,579
 no life, and yet suffer the hungry, and the

196
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:32,579
 needy, and the naked, and the sick and the afflicted to

197
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:34,579
 pass by you, and notice them not

198
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:35,887
40 Yea, why do ye build up your secret

199
00:07:35,887 --> 00:07:37,22
 abominations to get gain, and cause that widows should mourn

200
00:07:37,22 --> 00:07:38,553
 before the Lord, and also orphans to mourn before

201
00:07:38,553 --> 00:07:39,886
 the Lord, and also the blood of their fathers and

202
00:07:39,886 --> 00:07:41,219
 their husbands to cry unto the Lord from the

203
00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:42,552
 ground, for vengeance upon your heads

204
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:43,029
41 Behold, the sword of vengeance hangeth over

205
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:43,529
 you; and the time soon cometh that he avengeth the

206
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:44,029
 blood of the saints upon you, for he will not suffer

207
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:44,529
 their cries any longer.
