00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,0
Chapter 9 Moroni calls upon those who do not

2
00:00:01,0 --> 00:00:02,0
 believe in Christ to repent—He proclaims a God of

3
00:00:02,0 --> 00:00:03,0
 miracles, who gives revelations and pours out gifts and

4
00:00:03,0 --> 00:00:04,0
 signs upon the faithful—Miracles cease because of

5
00:00:04,0 --> 00:00:05,0
 unbelief—Signs follow those who believe—Men are

6
00:00:05,0 --> 00:00:06,0
 exhorted to be wise and keep the commandments.

7
00:00:06,0 --> 00:00:07,0
 About A.D. 401–21.

8
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:15,975
1 And now, I speak also concerning those who do

9
00:00:15,975 --> 00:00:23,975
 not believe in Christ

10
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,067
2 Behold, will ye believe in the day of your

11
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:26,21
 visitation—behold, when the Lord shall come, yea, even

12
00:00:26,21 --> 00:00:27,353
 that great day when the earth shall be rolled

13
00:00:27,353 --> 00:00:28,496
 together as a scroll, and the elements shall melt with

14
00:00:28,496 --> 00:00:29,639
 fervent heat, yea, in that great day when ye

15
00:00:29,639 --> 00:00:30,782
 shall be brought to stand before the Lamb of God—then

16
00:00:30,782 --> 00:00:31,925
 will ye say that there is no God

17
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,042
3 Then will ye longer deny the Christ, or can ye

18
00:00:33,042 --> 00:00:34,185
 behold the Lamb of God? Do ye suppose that ye shall

19
00:00:34,185 --> 00:00:35,328
 dwell with him under a consciousness of your

20
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,471
 guilt? Do ye suppose that ye could be happy to dwell

21
00:00:36,471 --> 00:00:37,614
 with that holy Being, when your souls are racked

22
00:00:37,614 --> 00:00:38,757
 with a consciousness of guilt that ye have ever

23
00:00:38,757 --> 00:00:39,9
 abused his laws

24
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,873
4 Behold, I say unto you that ye would be more

25
00:00:41,873 --> 00:00:43,873
 miserable to dwell with a holy and just God, under a

26
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:45,873
 consciousness of your filthiness before him, than

27
00:00:45,873 --> 00:00:47,873
 ye would to dwell with the damned souls in hell

28
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,848
5 For behold, when ye shall be brought to see your

29
00:00:49,848 --> 00:00:51,848
 nakedness before God, and also the glory of God,

30
00:00:51,848 --> 00:00:53,848
 and the holiness of Jesus Christ, it will kindle a

31
00:00:53,848 --> 00:00:55,848
 flame of unquenchable fire upon you

32
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,422
6 O then ye unbelieving, turn ye unto the Lord;

33
00:00:57,422 --> 00:00:59,022
 cry mightily unto the Father in the name of Jesus,

34
00:00:59,022 --> 00:01:00,622
 that perhaps ye may be found spotless, pure, fair,

35
00:01:00,622 --> 00:01:02,222
 and white, having been cleansed by the blood of

36
00:01:02,222 --> 00:01:03,822
 the Lamb, at that great and last day

37
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,397
7 And again I speak unto you who deny the

38
00:01:05,397 --> 00:01:06,997
 revelations of God, and say that they are done away, that

39
00:01:06,997 --> 00:01:08,597
 there are no revelations, nor prophecies, nor

40
00:01:08,597 --> 00:01:10,197
 gifts, nor healing, nor speaking with tongues, and the

41
00:01:10,197 --> 00:01:11,797
 interpretation of tongues

42
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:13,772
8 Behold I say unto you, he that denieth these

43
00:01:13,772 --> 00:01:15,772
 things knoweth not the gospel of Christ; yea, he has

44
00:01:15,772 --> 00:01:17,772
 not read the scriptures; if so, he does not

45
00:01:17,772 --> 00:01:19,772
 understand them

46
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,413
9 For do we not read that God is the same

47
00:01:22,413 --> 00:01:25,08
 yesterday, today, and forever, and in him there is no

48
00:01:25,08 --> 00:01:27,747
 variableness neither shadow of changing

49
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:29,721
10 And now, if ye have imagined up unto yourselves

50
00:01:29,721 --> 00:01:31,721
 a god who doth vary, and in whom there is shadow

51
00:01:31,721 --> 00:01:33,721
 of changing, then have ye imagined up unto

52
00:01:33,721 --> 00:01:35,721
 yourselves a god who is not a God of miracles

53
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:38,896
11 But behold, I will show unto you a God of

54
00:01:38,896 --> 00:01:42,096
 miracles, even the God of Abraham, and the God of

55
00:01:42,096 --> 00:01:45,296
 Isaac, and the God of Jacob; and it is that same God

56
00:01:45,296 --> 00:01:48,496
 who created the heavens and the earth, and all

57
00:01:48,496 --> 00:01:51,696
 things that in them are

58
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:59,645
12 Behold, he created Adam, and by Adam came the

59
00:01:59,645 --> 00:02:07,645
 fall of man. And because of the fall of man came

60
00:02:07,645 --> 00:02:15,645
 Jesus Christ, even the Father and the Son; and

61
00:02:15,645 --> 00:02:23,645
 because of Jesus Christ came the redemption of man

62
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:24,21
13 And because of the redemption of man, which

63
00:02:24,21 --> 00:02:24,877
 came by Jesus Christ, they are brought back into the

64
00:02:24,877 --> 00:02:25,544
 presence of the Lord; yea, this is wherein all men

65
00:02:25,544 --> 00:02:26,211
 are redeemed, because the death of Christ

66
00:02:26,211 --> 00:02:26,878
 bringeth to pass the resurrection, which bringeth to pass

67
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:27,545
 a redemption from an endless sleep, from which

68
00:02:27,545 --> 00:02:28,212
 sleep all men shall be awakened by the power of God

69
00:02:28,212 --> 00:02:28,879
 when the trump shall sound; and they shall come

70
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,546
 forth, both small and great, and all shall stand

71
00:02:29,546 --> 00:02:30,213
 before his bar, being redeemed and loosed from this

72
00:02:30,213 --> 00:02:30,88
 eternal band of death, which death is a temporal

73
00:02:30,88 --> 00:02:31,547
 death

74
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:32,851
14 And then cometh the judgment of the Holy One

75
00:02:32,851 --> 00:02:34,184
 upon them; and then cometh the time that he that is

76
00:02:34,184 --> 00:02:35,517
 filthy shall be filthy still; and he that is

77
00:02:35,517 --> 00:02:36,85
 righteous shall be righteous still; he that is happy

78
00:02:36,85 --> 00:02:38,183
 shall be happy still; and he that is unhappy shall

79
00:02:38,183 --> 00:02:39,516
 be unhappy still

80
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:40,826
15 And now, O all ye that have imagined up unto

81
00:02:40,826 --> 00:02:42,159
 yourselves a god who can do no miracles, I would ask

82
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,492
 of you, have all these things passed, of which I

83
00:02:43,492 --> 00:02:44,825
 have spoken? Has the end come yet? Behold I say

84
00:02:44,825 --> 00:02:46,158
 unto you, Nay; and God has not ceased to be a God of

85
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:47,491
 miracles

86
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:50,134
16 Behold, are not the things that God hath

87
00:02:50,134 --> 00:02:52,801
 wrought marvelous in our eyes? Yea, and who can

88
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:55,468
 comprehend the marvelous works of God

89
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:58,642
17 Who shall say that it was not a miracle that by

90
00:02:58,642 --> 00:03:01,842
 his word the heaven and the earth should be; and

91
00:03:01,842 --> 00:03:05,042
 by the power of his word man was created of the

92
00:03:05,042 --> 00:03:08,242
 dust of the earth; and by the power of his word have

93
00:03:08,242 --> 00:03:11,442
 miracles been wrought

94
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:14,058
18 And who shall say that Jesus Christ did not do

95
00:03:14,058 --> 00:03:16,725
 many mighty miracles? And there were many mighty

96
00:03:16,725 --> 00:03:19,392
 miracles wrought by the hands of the apostles

97
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,699
19 And if there were miracles wrought then, why

98
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:22,032
 has God ceased to be a God of miracles and yet be an

99
00:03:22,032 --> 00:03:23,365
 unchangeable Being? And behold, I say unto you he

100
00:03:23,365 --> 00:03:24,698
 changeth not; if so he would cease to be God; and

101
00:03:24,698 --> 00:03:26,031
 he ceaseth not to be God, and is a God of

102
00:03:26,031 --> 00:03:27,364
 miracles

103
00:03:27,34 --> 00:03:29,34
20 And the reason why he ceaseth to do miracles

104
00:03:29,34 --> 00:03:31,34
 among the children of men is because that they

105
00:03:31,34 --> 00:03:33,34
 dwindle in unbelief, and depart from the right way, and

106
00:03:33,34 --> 00:03:35,34
 know not the God in whom they should trust

107
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:40,115
21 Behold, I say unto you that whoso believeth in

108
00:03:40,115 --> 00:03:44,915
 Christ, doubting nothing, whatsoever he shall ask

109
00:03:44,915 --> 00:03:49,715
 the Father in the name of Christ it shall be

110
00:03:49,715 --> 00:03:54,515
 granted him; and this promise is unto all, even unto

111
00:03:54,515 --> 00:03:59,315
 the ends of the earth

112
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,839
22 For behold, thus said Jesus Christ, the Son of

113
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:02,439
 God, unto his disciples who should tarry, yea, and

114
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:04,039
 also to all his disciples, in the hearing of the

115
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,639
 multitude: Go ye into all the world, and preach

116
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:07,239
 the gospel to every creature

117
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:11,214
23 And he that believeth and is baptized shall be

118
00:04:11,214 --> 00:04:15,214
 saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned

119
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:19,188
24 And these signs shall follow them that

120
00:04:19,188 --> 00:04:23,188
 believe—in my name shall they cast out devils; they shall

121
00:04:23,188 --> 00:04:27,188
 speak with new tongues; they shall take up

122
00:04:27,188 --> 00:04:31,188
 serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not

123
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:35,188
 hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick and

124
00:04:35,188 --> 00:04:39,188
 they shall recover

125
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:47,112
25 And whosoever shall believe in my name,

126
00:04:47,112 --> 00:04:55,112
 doubting nothing, unto him will I confirm all my words,

127
00:04:55,112 --> 00:05:03,112
 even unto the ends of the earth

128
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,179
26 And now, behold, who can stand against the

129
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:05,322
 works of the Lord? Who can deny his sayings? Who will

130
00:05:05,322 --> 00:05:06,465
 rise up against the almighty power of the Lord?

131
00:05:06,465 --> 00:05:07,608
 Who will despise the works of the Lord? Who will

132
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:08,751
 despise the children of Christ? Behold, all ye who

133
00:05:08,751 --> 00:05:09,894
 are despisers of the works of the Lord, for ye shall

134
00:05:09,894 --> 00:05:11,037
 wonder and perish

135
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:12,011
27 O then despise not, and wonder not, but hearken

136
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:13,011
 unto the words of the Lord, and ask the Father in

137
00:05:13,011 --> 00:05:14,011
 the name of Jesus for what things soever ye shall

138
00:05:14,011 --> 00:05:15,011
 stand in need. Doubt not, but be believing, and

139
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:16,011
 begin as in times of old, and come unto the Lord

140
00:05:16,011 --> 00:05:17,011
 with all your heart, and work out your own salvation

141
00:05:17,011 --> 00:05:18,011
 with fear and trembling before him

142
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,185
28 Be wise in the days of your probation; strip

143
00:05:22,185 --> 00:05:25,385
 yourselves of all uncleanness; ask not, that ye may

144
00:05:25,385 --> 00:05:28,585
 consume it on your lusts, but ask with a firmness

145
00:05:28,585 --> 00:05:31,785
 unshaken, that ye will yield to no temptation, but

146
00:05:31,785 --> 00:05:34,985
 that ye will serve the true and living God

147
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:36,268
29 See that ye are not baptized unworthily; see

148
00:05:36,268 --> 00:05:37,601
 that ye partake not of the sacrament of Christ

149
00:05:37,601 --> 00:05:38,934
 unworthily; but see that ye do all things in

150
00:05:38,934 --> 00:05:40,267
 worthiness, and do it in the name of Jesus Christ, the Son

151
00:05:40,267 --> 00:05:41,6
 of the living God; and if ye do this, and endure to

152
00:05:41,6 --> 00:05:42,933
 the end, ye will in nowise be cast out

153
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:45,576
30 Behold, I speak unto you as though I spake from

154
00:05:45,576 --> 00:05:48,243
 the dead; for I know that ye shall have my words

155
00:05:48,243 --> 00:05:50,91


156
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:52,217
31 Condemn me not because of mine imperfection,

157
00:05:52,217 --> 00:05:53,55
 neither my father, because of his imperfection,

158
00:05:53,55 --> 00:05:54,883
 neither them who have written before him; but rather

159
00:05:54,883 --> 00:05:56,216
 give thanks unto God that he hath made manifest

160
00:05:56,216 --> 00:05:57,549
 unto you our imperfections, that ye may learn to be

161
00:05:57,549 --> 00:05:58,882
 more wise than we have been

162
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,459
32 And now, behold, we have written this record

163
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:02,058
 according to our knowledge, in the characters which

164
00:06:02,058 --> 00:06:03,659
 are called among us the reformed Egyptian, being

165
00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:05,258
 handed down and altered by us, according to our

166
00:06:05,258 --> 00:06:06,858
 manner of speech

167
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,433
33 And if our plates had been sufficiently large

168
00:06:08,433 --> 00:06:10,033
 we should have written in Hebrew; but the Hebrew

169
00:06:10,033 --> 00:06:11,633
 hath been altered by us also; and if we could have

170
00:06:11,633 --> 00:06:13,233
 written in Hebrew, behold, ye would have had no

171
00:06:13,233 --> 00:06:14,833
 imperfection in our record

172
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:16,408
34 But the Lord knoweth the things which we have

173
00:06:16,408 --> 00:06:18,008
 written, and also that none other people knoweth

174
00:06:18,008 --> 00:06:19,608
 our language; and because that none other people

175
00:06:19,608 --> 00:06:21,208
 knoweth our language, therefore he hath prepared

176
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:22,808
 means for the interpretation thereof

177
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:25,449
35 And these things are written that we may rid

178
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:28,116
 our garments of the blood of our brethren, who have

179
00:06:28,116 --> 00:06:30,783
 dwindled in unbelief

180
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,357
36 And behold, these things which we have desired

181
00:06:32,357 --> 00:06:33,957
 concerning our brethren, yea, even their

182
00:06:33,957 --> 00:06:35,557
 restoration to the knowledge of Christ, are according to

183
00:06:35,557 --> 00:06:37,157
 the prayers of all the saints who have dwelt in the

184
00:06:37,157 --> 00:06:38,757
 land

185
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,065
37 And may the Lord Jesus Christ grant that their

186
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:41,398
 prayers may be answered according to their faith;

187
00:06:41,398 --> 00:06:42,731
 and may God the Father remember the covenant which

188
00:06:42,731 --> 00:06:44,064
 he hath made with the house of Israel; and may he

189
00:06:44,064 --> 00:06:45,397
 bless them forever, through faith on the name of

190
00:06:45,397 --> 00:06:46,73
 Jesus Christ. Amen.
