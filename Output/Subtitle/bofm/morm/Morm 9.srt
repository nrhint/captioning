00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 9 Moroni calls upon those who do not

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
believe in Christ to repent—He proclaims a

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
God of miracles, who gives revelations and

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
pours out gifts and signs upon the

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
faithful—Miracles cease because of unbelief—Signs follow

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
those who believe—Men are exhorted to be wise

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:09:09,
and keep the commandments. About A.D. 401–21. 

8
00:09:09,0 --> 00:09:09,0
1 And now, I speak also concerning

9
00:09:09,0 --> 00:10:21,
those who do not believe in Christ.

10
00:10:21,0 --> 00:10:21,0
2 Behold, will ye believe in the

11
00:10:21,0 --> 00:10:21,0
day of your visitation—behold,

12
00:10:21,0 --> 00:10:21,0
when the Lord shall come, yea, even

13
00:10:21,0 --> 00:10:21,0
that great day when the earth

14
00:10:21,0 --> 00:10:21,0
shall be rolled together as a

15
00:10:21,0 --> 00:10:21,0
scroll, and the elements shall melt

16
00:10:21,0 --> 00:10:21,0
with fervent heat, yea, in that

17
00:10:21,0 --> 00:10:21,0
great day when ye shall be brought

18
00:10:21,0 --> 00:10:21,0
to stand before the Lamb of

19
00:10:21,0 --> 00:15:04,
God—then will ye say that there is no God?

20
00:15:04,0 --> 00:15:04,0
3 Then will ye longer deny the

21
00:15:04,0 --> 00:15:04,0
Christ, or can ye behold the

22
00:15:04,0 --> 00:15:04,0
Lamb of God? Do ye suppose that

23
00:15:04,0 --> 00:15:04,0
ye shall dwell with him under a

24
00:15:04,0 --> 00:15:04,0
consciousness of your guilt? Do

25
00:15:04,0 --> 00:15:04,0
ye suppose that ye could be

26
00:15:04,0 --> 00:15:04,0
happy to dwell with that holy

27
00:15:04,0 --> 00:15:04,0
Being, when your souls are racked

28
00:15:04,0 --> 00:15:04,0
with a consciousness of guilt

29
00:15:04,0 --> 00:21:15,
that ye have ever abused his laws?

30
00:21:15,0 --> 00:21:15,0
4 Behold, I say unto you

31
00:21:15,0 --> 00:21:15,0
that ye would be more miserable

32
00:21:15,0 --> 00:21:15,0
to dwell with a holy and

33
00:21:15,0 --> 00:21:15,0
just God, under a

34
00:21:15,0 --> 00:21:15,0
consciousness of your filthiness before

35
00:21:15,0 --> 00:21:15,0
him, than ye would to dwell

36
00:21:15,0 --> 00:30:24,
with the damned souls in hell.

37
00:30:24,0 --> 00:30:24,0
5 For behold, when ye

38
00:30:24,0 --> 00:30:24,0
shall be brought to see your

39
00:30:24,0 --> 00:30:24,0
nakedness before God, and

40
00:30:24,0 --> 00:30:24,0
also the glory of God, and

41
00:30:24,0 --> 00:30:24,0
the holiness of Jesus

42
00:30:24,0 --> 00:30:24,0
Christ, it will kindle a flame

43
00:30:24,0 --> 00:31:36,
of unquenchable fire upon you.

44
00:31:36,0 --> 00:31:36,0
6 O then ye

45
00:31:36,0 --> 00:31:36,0
unbelieving, turn ye unto the

46
00:31:36,0 --> 00:31:36,0
Lord; cry mightily unto the

47
00:31:36,0 --> 00:31:36,0
Father in the name of

48
00:31:36,0 --> 00:31:36,0
Jesus, that perhaps ye

49
00:31:36,0 --> 00:31:36,0
may be found spotless,

50
00:31:36,0 --> 00:31:36,0
pure, fair, and white,

51
00:31:36,0 --> 00:31:36,0
having been cleansed by

52
00:31:36,0 --> 00:31:36,0
the blood of the Lamb,

53
00:31:36,0 --> 00:32:48,
at that great and last day.

54
00:32:48,0 --> 00:32:48,0
7 And again I speak

55
00:32:48,0 --> 00:32:48,0
unto you who deny the

56
00:32:48,0 --> 00:32:48,0
revelations of God, and

57
00:32:48,0 --> 00:32:48,0
say that they are done

58
00:32:48,0 --> 00:32:48,0
away, that there are

59
00:32:48,0 --> 00:32:48,0
no revelations, nor

60
00:32:48,0 --> 00:32:48,0
prophecies, nor gifts,

61
00:32:48,0 --> 00:32:48,0
nor healing, nor

62
00:32:48,0 --> 00:32:48,0
speaking with tongues, and

63
00:32:48,0 --> 00:32:20,
the interpretation of tongues;

64
00:32:20,0 --> 00:32:20,0
8 Behold I say unto

65
00:32:20,0 --> 00:32:20,0
you, he that denieth

66
00:32:20,0 --> 00:32:20,0
these things

67
00:32:20,0 --> 00:32:20,0
knoweth not the gospel of

68
00:32:20,0 --> 00:32:20,0
Christ; yea, he has

69
00:32:20,0 --> 00:32:20,0
not read the

70
00:32:20,0 --> 00:32:20,0
scriptures; if so, he does

71
00:32:20,0 --> 00:34:32,
not understand them.

72
00:34:32,0 --> 00:34:32,0
9 For do we not

73
00:34:32,0 --> 00:34:32,0
read that God is the

74
00:34:32,0 --> 00:34:32,0
same yesterday,

75
00:34:32,0 --> 00:34:32,0
today, and forever, and

76
00:34:32,0 --> 00:34:32,0
in him there is no

77
00:34:32,0 --> 00:34:32,0
variableness

78
00:34:32,0 --> 00:36:44,
neither shadow of changing?

79
00:36:44,0 --> 00:36:44,0
10 And now, if ye

80
00:36:44,0 --> 00:36:44,0
have imagined up

81
00:36:44,0 --> 00:36:44,0
unto yourselves a

82
00:36:44,0 --> 00:36:44,0
god who doth vary,

83
00:36:44,0 --> 00:36:44,0
and in whom there

84
00:36:44,0 --> 00:36:44,0
is shadow of

85
00:36:44,0 --> 00:36:44,0
changing, then have ye

86
00:36:44,0 --> 00:36:44,0
imagined up unto

87
00:36:44,0 --> 00:36:44,0
yourselves a god

88
00:36:44,0 --> 00:36:16,
who is not a God of miracles.

89
00:36:16,0 --> 00:36:16,0
11 But behold, I

90
00:36:16,0 --> 00:36:16,0
will show unto

91
00:36:16,0 --> 00:36:16,0
you a God of

92
00:36:16,0 --> 00:36:16,0
miracles, even the

93
00:36:16,0 --> 00:36:16,0
God of Abraham,

94
00:36:16,0 --> 00:36:16,0
and the God of

95
00:36:16,0 --> 00:36:16,0
Isaac, and the

96
00:36:16,0 --> 00:36:16,0
God of Jacob; and

97
00:36:16,0 --> 00:36:16,0
it is that same

98
00:36:16,0 --> 00:36:16,0
God who created

99
00:36:16,0 --> 00:36:16,0
the heavens and

100
00:36:16,0 --> 00:36:16,0
the earth, and

101
00:36:16,0 --> 00:39:47,
all things that in them are.

102
00:39:47,0 --> 00:39:47,0
12 Behold, he

103
00:39:47,0 --> 00:39:47,0
created Adam,

104
00:39:47,0 --> 00:39:47,0
and by Adam came

105
00:39:47,0 --> 00:39:47,0
the fall of

106
00:39:47,0 --> 00:39:47,0
man. And because

107
00:39:47,0 --> 00:39:47,0
of the fall of

108
00:39:47,0 --> 00:39:47,0
man came Jesus

109
00:39:47,0 --> 00:39:47,0
Christ, even the

110
00:39:47,0 --> 00:39:47,0
Father and the

111
00:39:47,0 --> 00:39:47,0
Son; and

112
00:39:47,0 --> 00:39:47,0
because of Jesus

113
00:39:47,0 --> 00:39:47,0
Christ came the

114
00:39:47,0 --> 00:44:58,
redemption of man.

115
00:44:58,0 --> 00:44:58,0
13 And because

116
00:44:58,0 --> 00:44:58,0
of the

117
00:44:58,0 --> 00:44:58,0
redemption of man,

118
00:44:58,0 --> 00:44:58,0
which came by

119
00:44:58,0 --> 00:44:58,0
Jesus Christ,

120
00:44:58,0 --> 00:44:58,0
they are

121
00:44:58,0 --> 00:44:58,0
brought back into

122
00:44:58,0 --> 00:44:58,0
the presence of

123
00:44:58,0 --> 00:44:58,0
the Lord; yea,

124
00:44:58,0 --> 00:44:58,0
this is

125
00:44:58,0 --> 00:44:58,0
wherein all men are

126
00:44:58,0 --> 00:44:58,0
redeemed,

127
00:44:58,0 --> 00:44:58,0
because the death

128
00:44:58,0 --> 00:44:58,0
of Christ

129
00:44:58,0 --> 00:44:58,0
bringeth to pass

130
00:44:58,0 --> 00:44:58,0
the

131
00:44:58,0 --> 00:44:58,0
resurrection, which

132
00:44:58,0 --> 00:44:58,0
bringeth to pass a

133
00:44:58,0 --> 00:44:58,0
redemption

134
00:44:58,0 --> 00:44:58,0
from an endless

135
00:44:58,0 --> 00:44:58,0
sleep, from

136
00:44:58,0 --> 00:44:58,0
which sleep all

137
00:44:58,0 --> 00:44:58,0
men shall be

138
00:44:58,0 --> 00:44:58,0
awakened by the

139
00:44:58,0 --> 00:44:58,0
power of God

140
00:44:58,0 --> 00:44:58,0
when the trump

141
00:44:58,0 --> 00:44:58,0
shall sound;

142
00:44:58,0 --> 00:44:58,0
and they shall

143
00:44:58,0 --> 00:44:58,0
come forth,

144
00:44:58,0 --> 00:44:58,0
both small and

145
00:44:58,0 --> 00:44:58,0
great, and all

146
00:44:58,0 --> 00:44:58,0
shall stand

147
00:44:58,0 --> 00:44:58,0
before his bar,

148
00:44:58,0 --> 00:44:58,0
being

149
00:44:58,0 --> 00:44:58,0
redeemed and loosed

150
00:44:58,0 --> 00:44:58,0
from this

151
00:44:58,0 --> 00:51:09,
eternal band of death, which death is a temporal death.

152
00:51:09,0 --> 00:51:09,0
14 And then

153
00:51:09,0 --> 00:51:09,0
cometh the

154
00:51:09,0 --> 00:51:09,0
judgment of the

155
00:51:09,0 --> 00:51:09,0
Holy One upon

156
00:51:09,0 --> 00:51:09,0
them; and then

157
00:51:09,0 --> 00:51:09,0
cometh the time

158
00:51:09,0 --> 00:51:09,0
that he that

159
00:51:09,0 --> 00:51:09,0
is filthy shall

160
00:51:09,0 --> 00:51:09,0
be filthy

161
00:51:09,0 --> 00:51:09,0
still; and he

162
00:51:09,0 --> 00:51:09,0
that is righteous

163
00:51:09,0 --> 00:51:09,0
shall be

164
00:51:09,0 --> 00:51:09,0
righteous still;

165
00:51:09,0 --> 00:51:09,0
he that is

166
00:51:09,0 --> 00:51:09,0
happy shall be

167
00:51:09,0 --> 00:51:09,0
happy still; and

168
00:51:09,0 --> 00:51:09,0
he that is

169
00:51:09,0 --> 00:51:09,0
unhappy shall be

170
00:51:09,0 --> 00:58:39,
unhappy still.

171
00:58:39,0 --> 00:58:39,0
15 And now, O

172
00:58:39,0 --> 00:58:39,0
all ye that

173
00:58:39,0 --> 00:58:39,0
have imagined

174
00:58:39,0 --> 00:58:39,0
up unto

175
00:58:39,0 --> 00:58:39,0
yourselves a god

176
00:58:39,0 --> 00:58:39,0
who can do no

177
00:58:39,0 --> 00:58:39,0
miracles, I

178
00:58:39,0 --> 00:58:39,0
would ask of

179
00:58:39,0 --> 00:58:39,0
you, have all

180
00:58:39,0 --> 00:58:39,0
these things

181
00:58:39,0 --> 00:58:39,0
passed, of

182
00:58:39,0 --> 00:58:39,0
which I have

183
00:58:39,0 --> 00:58:39,0
spoken? Has

184
00:58:39,0 --> 00:58:39,0
the end come

185
00:58:39,0 --> 00:58:39,0
yet? Behold I

186
00:58:39,0 --> 00:58:39,0
say unto you,

187
00:58:39,0 --> 00:58:39,0
Nay; and God

188
00:58:39,0 --> 00:58:39,0
has not

189
00:58:39,0 --> 01:00:51,
ceased to be a God of miracles.

190
01:00:51,0 --> 01:00:51,0
16 Behold,

191
01:00:51,0 --> 01:00:51,0
are not the

192
01:00:51,0 --> 01:00:51,0
things that God

193
01:00:51,0 --> 01:00:51,0
hath wrought

194
01:00:51,0 --> 01:00:51,0
marvelous in

195
01:00:51,0 --> 01:00:51,0
our eyes?

196
01:00:51,0 --> 01:00:51,0
Yea, and who can

197
01:00:51,0 --> 01:00:51,0
comprehend

198
01:00:51,0 --> 01:00:51,0
the marvelous

199
01:00:51,0 --> 01:00:23,
works of God?

200
01:00:23,0 --> 01:00:23,0
17 Who shall

201
01:00:23,0 --> 01:00:23,0
say that it

202
01:00:23,0 --> 01:00:23,0
was not a

203
01:00:23,0 --> 01:00:23,0
miracle that

204
01:00:23,0 --> 01:00:23,0
by his word

205
01:00:23,0 --> 01:00:23,0
the heaven

206
01:00:23,0 --> 01:00:23,0
and the earth

207
01:00:23,0 --> 01:00:23,0
should be;

208
01:00:23,0 --> 01:00:23,0
and by the

209
01:00:23,0 --> 01:00:23,0
power of his

210
01:00:23,0 --> 01:00:23,0
word man was

211
01:00:23,0 --> 01:00:23,0
created of

212
01:00:23,0 --> 01:00:23,0
the dust of

213
01:00:23,0 --> 01:00:23,0
the earth;

214
01:00:23,0 --> 01:00:23,0
and by the

215
01:00:23,0 --> 01:00:23,0
power of his

216
01:00:23,0 --> 01:00:23,0
word have

217
01:00:23,0 --> 00:59:55,
miracles been wrought?

218
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
18 And who

219
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
shall say

220
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
that Jesus

221
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
Christ did

222
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
not do many

223
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
mighty

224
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
miracles? And

225
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
there were

226
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
many mighty

227
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
miracles

228
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
wrought by

229
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
the hands of

230
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,
the apostles.

231
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
19 And if

232
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
there were

233
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
miracles

234
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
wrought

235
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
then, why

236
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
has God

237
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
ceased to be a

238
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
God of

239
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
miracles and

240
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
yet be an

241
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0


242
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
unchangeable Being?

243
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
And

244
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
behold, I say

245
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
unto you he

246
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
changeth

247
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
not; if so

248
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
he would

249
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
cease to

250
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
be God; and

251
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
he

252
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
ceaseth not to

253
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,
be God, and is a God of miracles.

254
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
20 And

255
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
the reason

256
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
why he

257
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
ceaseth to

258
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
do

259
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
miracles among

260
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
the

261
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0

00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
men is

263
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
because that

264
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
they

265
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
dwindle in

266
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
unbelief,

267
00:59:55,0 --> 00:59:55,0
and depart

268

whom they should trust.

274
