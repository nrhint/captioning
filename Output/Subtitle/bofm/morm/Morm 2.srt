Chapter 2 Mormon leads the Nephite armies—Blood

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and carnage sweep the land—The Nephites lament

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and mourn with the sorrowing of the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
damned—Their day of grace is passed—Mormon obtains the

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:14:09,
plates of Nephi—Wars continue. About A.D. 327–50. 

6
00:14:09,0 --> 00:14:09,0
1 And it came to pass in that same year there

7
00:14:09,0 --> 00:14:09,0
began to be a war again between the Nephites

8
00:14:09,0 --> 00:14:09,0
and the Lamanites. And notwithstanding I

9
00:14:09,0 --> 00:14:09,0
being young, was large in stature; therefore the

10
00:14:09,0 --> 00:14:09,0
people of Nephi appointed me that I should

11
00:14:09,0 --> 00:16:51,
be their leader, or the leader of their armies.

12
00:16:51,0 --> 00:16:51,0
2 Therefore it came to pass that in my

13
00:16:51,0 --> 00:16:51,0
sixteenth year I did go forth at the

14
00:16:51,0 --> 00:16:51,0
head of an army of the Nephites, against

15
00:16:51,0 --> 00:16:51,0
the Lamanites; therefore three hundred

16
00:16:51,0 --> 00:20:21,
and twenty and six years had passed away.

17
00:20:21,0 --> 00:20:21,0
3 And it came to pass that in the

18
00:20:21,0 --> 00:20:21,0
three hundred and twenty and seventh year

19
00:20:21,0 --> 00:20:21,0
the Lamanites did come upon us with

20
00:20:21,0 --> 00:20:21,0
exceedingly great power, insomuch that

21
00:20:21,0 --> 00:20:21,0
they did frighten my armies; therefore

22
00:20:21,0 --> 00:20:21,0
they would not fight, and they began

23
00:20:21,0 --> 00:22:33,
to retreat towards the north countries.

24
00:22:33,0 --> 00:22:33,0
4 And it came to pass that we did

25
00:22:33,0 --> 00:22:33,0
come to the city of Angola, and we did

26
00:22:33,0 --> 00:22:33,0
take possession of the city, and make

27
00:22:33,0 --> 00:22:33,0
preparations to defend ourselves

28
00:22:33,0 --> 00:22:33,0
against the Lamanites. And it came to

29
00:22:33,0 --> 00:22:33,0
pass that we did fortify the city with

30
00:22:33,0 --> 00:22:33,0
our might; but notwithstanding all our

31
00:22:33,0 --> 00:22:33,0
fortifications the Lamanites did

32
00:22:33,0 --> 00:24:45,
come upon us and did drive us out of the city.

33
00:24:45,0 --> 00:24:45,0
5 And they did also drive us

34
00:24:45,0 --> 00:27:27,
forth out of the land of David.

35
00:27:27,0 --> 00:27:27,0
6 And we marched forth

36
00:27:27,0 --> 00:27:27,0
and came to the land of

37
00:27:27,0 --> 00:27:27,0
Joshua, which was in the

38
00:27:27,0 --> 00:36:36,
borders west by the seashore.

39
00:36:36,0 --> 00:36:36,0
7 And it came to pass

40
00:36:36,0 --> 00:36:36,0
that we did gather

41
00:36:36,0 --> 00:36:36,0
in our people as fast

42
00:36:36,0 --> 00:36:36,0
as it were possible,

43
00:36:36,0 --> 00:36:36,0
that we might get

44
00:36:36,0 --> 00:41:47,
them together in one body.

45
00:41:47,0 --> 00:41:47,0
8 But behold, the

46
00:41:47,0 --> 00:41:47,0
land was filled with

47
00:41:47,0 --> 00:41:47,0
robbers and with

48
00:41:47,0 --> 00:41:47,0
Lamanites; and

49
00:41:47,0 --> 00:41:47,0
notwithstanding the great

50
00:41:47,0 --> 00:41:47,0
destruction which hung

51
00:41:47,0 --> 00:41:47,0
over my people, they

52
00:41:47,0 --> 00:41:47,0
did not repent of

53
00:41:47,0 --> 00:41:47,0
their evil doings;

54
00:41:47,0 --> 00:41:47,0
therefore there was

55
00:41:47,0 --> 00:41:47,0
blood and carnage

56
00:41:47,0 --> 00:41:47,0
spread throughout all

57
00:41:47,0 --> 00:41:47,0
the face of the land,

58
00:41:47,0 --> 00:41:47,0
both on the part of

59
00:41:47,0 --> 00:41:47,0
the Nephites and

60
00:41:47,0 --> 00:41:47,0
also on the part of the

61
00:41:47,0 --> 00:41:47,0
Lamanites; and it

62
00:41:47,0 --> 00:41:47,0
was one complete

63
00:41:47,0 --> 00:41:47,0
revolution throughout

64
00:41:47,0 --> 00:41:19,
all the face of the land.

65
00:41:19,0 --> 00:41:19,0
9 And now, the

66
00:41:19,0 --> 00:41:19,0
Lamanites had a king,

67
00:41:19,0 --> 00:41:19,0
and his name was

68
00:41:19,0 --> 00:41:19,0
Aaron; and he came

69
00:41:19,0 --> 00:41:19,0
against us with an

70
00:41:19,0 --> 00:41:19,0
army of forty and four

71
00:41:19,0 --> 00:41:19,0
thousand. And

72
00:41:19,0 --> 00:41:19,0
behold, I withstood him

73
00:41:19,0 --> 00:41:19,0
with forty and two

74
00:41:19,0 --> 00:41:19,0
thousand. And it

75
00:41:19,0 --> 00:41:19,0
came to pass that I

76
00:41:19,0 --> 00:41:19,0
beat him with my

77
00:41:19,0 --> 00:41:19,0
army that he fled

78
00:41:19,0 --> 00:41:19,0
before me. And behold,

79
00:41:19,0 --> 00:41:19,0
all this was done,

80
00:41:19,0 --> 00:41:19,0
and three hundred

81
00:41:19,0 --> 00:42:31,
and thirty years had passed away.

82
00:42:31,0 --> 00:42:31,0
10 And it came to

83
00:42:31,0 --> 00:42:31,0
pass that the

84
00:42:31,0 --> 00:42:31,0
Nephites began to

85
00:42:31,0 --> 00:42:31,0
repent of their

86
00:42:31,0 --> 00:42:31,0
iniquity, and began to

87
00:42:31,0 --> 00:42:31,0
cry even as had

88
00:42:31,0 --> 00:42:31,0
been prophesied by

89
00:42:31,0 --> 00:42:31,0
Samuel the prophet;

90
00:42:31,0 --> 00:42:31,0
for behold no man

91
00:42:31,0 --> 00:42:31,0
could keep that

92
00:42:31,0 --> 00:42:31,0
which was his own,

93
00:42:31,0 --> 00:42:31,0
for the thieves,

94
00:42:31,0 --> 00:42:31,0
and the robbers, and

95
00:42:31,0 --> 00:42:31,0
the murderers,

96
00:42:31,0 --> 00:42:31,0
and the magic art,

97
00:42:31,0 --> 00:42:31,0
and the witchcraft

98
00:42:31,0 --> 00:42:03,
which was in the land.

99
00:42:03,0 --> 00:42:03,0
11 Thus there

100
00:42:03,0 --> 00:42:03,0
began to be a

101
00:42:03,0 --> 00:42:03,0
mourning and a

102
00:42:03,0 --> 00:42:03,0
lamentation in all the

103
00:42:03,0 --> 00:42:03,0
land because of

104
00:42:03,0 --> 00:42:03,0
these things, and

105
00:42:03,0 --> 00:42:03,0
more especially

106
00:42:03,0 --> 00:41:35,
among the people of Nephi.

107
00:41:35,0 --> 00:41:35,0
12 And it came

108
00:41:35,0 --> 00:41:35,0
to pass that when

109
00:41:35,0 --> 00:41:35,0
I, Mormon, saw

110
00:41:35,0 --> 00:41:35,0
their

111
00:41:35,0 --> 00:41:35,0
lamentation and their

112
00:41:35,0 --> 00:41:35,0
mourning and their

113
00:41:35,0 --> 00:41:35,0
sorrow before the

114
00:41:35,0 --> 00:41:35,0
Lord, my heart

115
00:41:35,0 --> 00:41:35,0
did begin to

116
00:41:35,0 --> 00:41:35,0
rejoice within me,

117
00:41:35,0 --> 00:41:35,0
knowing the

118
00:41:35,0 --> 00:41:35,0
mercies and the

119
00:41:35,0 --> 00:41:35,0
long-suffering of

120
00:41:35,0 --> 00:41:35,0
the Lord,

121
00:41:35,0 --> 00:41:35,0
therefore supposing that

122
00:41:35,0 --> 00:41:35,0
he would be

123
00:41:35,0 --> 00:41:35,0
merciful unto them

124
00:41:35,0 --> 00:41:35,0
that they would

125
00:41:35,0 --> 00:44:03,
again become a righteous people.

126
00:44:03,0 --> 00:44:03,0
13 But behold

127
00:44:03,0 --> 00:44:03,0
this my joy was

128
00:44:03,0 --> 00:44:03,0
vain, for their

129
00:44:03,0 --> 00:44:03,0
sorrowing was

130
00:44:03,0 --> 00:44:03,0
not unto

131
00:44:03,0 --> 00:44:03,0
repentance, because

132
00:44:03,0 --> 00:44:03,0
of the goodness

133
00:44:03,0 --> 00:44:03,0
of God; but it

134
00:44:03,0 --> 00:44:03,0
was rather the

135
00:44:03,0 --> 00:44:03,0
sorrowing of

136
00:44:03,0 --> 00:44:03,0
the damned,

137
00:44:03,0 --> 00:44:03,0
because the Lord

138
00:44:03,0 --> 00:44:03,0
would not always

139
00:44:03,0 --> 00:44:03,0
suffer them to

140
00:44:03,0 --> 00:47:33,
take happiness in sin.

141
00:47:33,0 --> 00:47:33,0
14 And they

142
00:47:33,0 --> 00:47:33,0
did not come

143
00:47:33,0 --> 00:47:33,0
unto Jesus with

144
00:47:33,0 --> 00:47:33,0
broken hearts

145
00:47:33,0 --> 00:47:33,0
and contrite

146
00:47:33,0 --> 00:47:33,0
spirits, but

147
00:47:33,0 --> 00:47:33,0
they did curse

148
00:47:33,0 --> 00:47:33,0
God, and wish to

149
00:47:33,0 --> 00:47:33,0
die.

150
00:47:33,0 --> 00:47:33,0
Nevertheless they

151
00:47:33,0 --> 00:47:33,0
would struggle

152
00:47:33,0 --> 00:47:33,0
with the sword

153
00:47:33,0 --> 00:53:01,
for their lives.

154
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
15 And it

155
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
came to pass

156
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
that my sorrow

157
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
did return

158
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
unto me again,

159
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
and I saw that

160
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
the day of

161
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
grace was

162
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
passed with them,

163
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
both

164
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
temporally and

165
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
spiritually; for I

166
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
saw

167
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
thousands of them

168
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
hewn down in

169
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
open rebellion

170
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
against their

171
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
God, and

172
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
heaped up as dung

173
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
upon the

174
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
face of the

175
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
land. And thus

176
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
three hundred

177
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
and forty and

178
00:53:01,0 --> 00:52:33,
four years had passed away.

179
00:52:33,0 --> 00:52:33,0
16 And it

180
00:52:33,0 --> 00:52:33,0
came to pass

181
00:52:33,0 --> 00:52:33,0
that in the

182
00:52:33,0 --> 00:52:33,0
three hundred

183
00:52:33,0 --> 00:52:33,0
and forty

184
00:52:33,0 --> 00:52:33,0
and fifth

185
00:52:33,0 --> 00:52:33,0
year the

186
00:52:33,0 --> 00:52:33,0
Nephites did begin

187
00:52:33,0 --> 00:52:33,0
to flee

188
00:52:33,0 --> 00:52:33,0
before the

189
00:52:33,0 --> 00:52:33,0
Lamanites; and

190
00:52:33,0 --> 00:52:33,0
they were

191
00:52:33,0 --> 00:52:33,0
pursued until

192
00:52:33,0 --> 00:52:33,0
they came

193
00:52:33,0 --> 00:52:33,0
even to the

194
00:52:33,0 --> 00:52:33,0
land of Jashon,

195
00:52:33,0 --> 00:52:33,0
before it

196
00:52:33,0 --> 00:52:33,0
was possible

197
00:52:33,0 --> 00:53:45,
to stop them in their retreat.

198
00:53:45,0 --> 00:53:45,0
17 And now,

199
00:53:45,0 --> 00:53:45,0
the city

200
00:53:45,0 --> 00:53:45,0
of Jashon

201
00:53:45,0 --> 00:53:45,0
was near the

202
00:53:45,0 --> 00:53:45,0
land where

203
00:53:45,0 --> 00:53:45,0
Ammaron had

204
00:53:45,0 --> 00:53:45,0
deposited

205
00:53:45,0 --> 00:53:45,0
the records

206
00:53:45,0 --> 00:53:45,0
unto the

207
00:53:45,0 --> 00:53:45,0
Lord, that

208
00:53:45,0 --> 00:53:45,0
they might

209
00:53:45,0 --> 00:53:45,0
not be

210
00:53:45,0 --> 00:53:45,0
destroyed. And

211
00:53:45,0 --> 00:53:45,0
behold I had

212
00:53:45,0 --> 00:53:45,0
gone

213
00:53:45,0 --> 00:53:45,0
according to the

214
00:53:45,0 --> 00:53:45,0
word of

215
00:53:45,0 --> 00:53:45,0
Ammaron, and

216
00:53:45,0 --> 00:53:45,0
taken the

217
00:53:45,0 --> 00:53:45,0
plates of

218
00:53:45,0 --> 00:53:45,0
Nephi, and

219
00:53:45,0 --> 00:53:45,0
did make a

220
00:53:45,0 --> 00:53:45,0
record

221
00:53:45,0 --> 00:57:15,
according to the words of Ammaron.

222

00:57:15,0 --> 00:57:15,0
Nephi I did

226
00:57:15,0 --> 00:57:15,0
make a full

227
00:57:15,0 --> 00:57:15,0
account of

228
00:57:15,0 --> 00:57:15,0
all the

00:57:15,0 --> 00:57:15,0

00:57:15,0 --> 00:57:15,0
and

231
00:57:15,0 --> 00:57:15,0
abominations;

232
00:57:15,0 --> 00:57:15,0
but upon

233
00:57:15,0 --> 00:57:15,0
these plates

234
00:57:15,0 --> 00:57:15,0
I did

235
00:57:15,0 --> 00:57:15,0
forbear to

236
00:57:15,0 --> 00:57:15,0
make a full

00:57:15,0 --> 00:57:15,0

00:57:15,0 --> 00:57:15,0
their

239
00:57:15,0 --> 00:57:15,0
wickedness and

240
00:57:15,0 --> 00:57:15,0


241
00:57:15,0 --> 00:57:15,0
abominations, for

242
00:57:15,0 --> 00:57:15,0
behold, a

243
00:57:15,0 --> 00:57:15,0
continual

244
00:57:15,0 --> 00:57:15,0
scene of

245
00:57:15,0 --> 00:57:15,0
wickedness

246
00:57:15,0 --> 00:57:15,0
and

247
00:57:15,0 --> 00:57:15,0

248
00:57:15,0 --> 00:57:15,0
been

249
00:57:15,0 --> 00:57:15,0
before mine

250
00:57:15,0 --> 00:57:15,0
eyes ever

251
00:57:15,0 --> 00:57:15,0
since I have

252
00:57:15,0 --> 00:57:15,0
been

253
00:57:15,0 --> 01:02:25,
sufficient to behold the ways of man.

254
01:02:25,0 --> 01:02:25,0
19 And wo

255
01:02:25,0 --> 01:02:25,0
is me

256
01:02:25,0 --> 01:02:25,0
because of

257
01:02:25,0 --> 01:02:25,0
their

258
01:02:25,0 --> 01:02:25,0
wickedness;

259
01:02:25,0 --> 01:02:25,0
for my

260
01:02:25,0 --> 01:02:25,0
heart has

261
01:02:25,0 --> 01:02:25,0
been

262
01:02:25,0 --> 01:02:25,0
filled with

263
01:02:25,0 --> 01:02:25,0
sorrow

264
01:02:25,0 --> 01:02:25,0
because of

265
01:02:25,0 --> 01:02:25,0
their

266
01:02:25,0 --> 01:02:25,0

267
01:02:25,0 --> 01:02:25,0
all my

268
01:02:25,0 --> 01:02:25,0
days;

269
01:02:25,0 --> 01:02:25,0
nevertheless, I

270
01:02:25,0 --> 01:02:25,0
know that

271
01:02:25,0 --> 01:02:25,0
I shall

272
01:02:25,0 --> 01:02:25,0
be lifted

273
01:02:25,0 --> 01:05:07,
up at the last day.

274
01:05:07,0 --> 01:05:07,0
20 And

275
01:05:07,0 --> 01:05:07,0
it came

276
01:05:07,0 --> 01:05:07,0
to pass

277
01:05:07,0 --> 01:05:07,0
that in

278
01:05:07,0 --> 01:05:07,0
this year

279
01:05:07,0 --> 01:05:07,0

01:05:07,0 --> 01:05:07,0
Nephi

283
01:05:07,0 --> 01:05:07,0
hunted

284
01:05:07,0 --> 01:05:07,0
and

285
01:05:07,0 --> 01:05:07,0
driven. And

286
01:05:07,0 --> 01:05:07,0
it came

287
01:05:07,0 --> 01:05:07,0
to pass

288
01:05:07,0 --> 01:05:07,0
that we

289
01:05:07,0 --> 01:05:07,0
were

290
01:05:07,0 --> 01:05:07,0
driven forth

291
01:05:07,0 --> 01:05:07,0
until

292
01:05:07,0 --> 01:05:07,0
we had

293
01:05:07,0 --> 01:05:07,0
come

294
01:05:07,0 --> 01:05:07,0
northward to

295
01:05:07,0 --> 01:05:07,0
the land

296
01:05:07,0 --> 01:05:51,
which was called Shem.

297
01:05:51,0 --> 01:05:51,0
21 And

298
01:05:51,0 --> 01:05:51,0
it came

299
01:05:51,0 --> 01:05:51,0
to

300
01:05:51,0 --> 01:05:51,0
pass that

301
01:05:51,0 --> 01:05:51,0
we did

302
01:05:51,0 --> 01:05:51,0
fortify

303
01:05:51,0 --> 01:05:51,0
the

304
01:05:51,0 --> 01:05:51,0
city of

305
01:05:51,0 --> 01:05:51,0
Shem,

306
01:05:51,0 --> 01:05:51,0
and we

307
01:05:51,0 --> 01:05:51,0
did

308
01:05:51,0 --> 01:05:51,0
gather in

309
01:05:51,0 --> 01:05:51,0

310
01:05:51,0 --> 01:05:51,0

311

315
01:05:51,0 --> 01:05:51,0


316
01:05:51,0 --> 01:05:51,0
perhaps we

317
01:05:51,0 --> 01:05:51,0
might

318
01:05:51,0 --> 01:05:37,
save them from destruction.

319
01:05:37,0 --> 01:05:37,0
22 And

01:07:49,0 --> 01:07:49,0
