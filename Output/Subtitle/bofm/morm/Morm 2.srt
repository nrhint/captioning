Chapter 2 Mormon leads the Nephite armies—Blood

2
00:00:01,4 --> 00:00:02,8
 and carnage sweep the land—The Nephites lament and

3
00:00:02,8 --> 00:00:04,2
 mourn with the sorrowing of the damned—Their day of

4
00:00:04,2 --> 00:00:05,6
 grace is passed—Mormon obtains the plates of

5
00:00:05,6 --> 00:00:07,0
 Nephi—Wars continue. About A.D. 327–50.

6
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,308
1 And it came to pass in that same year there

7
00:00:09,308 --> 00:00:10,641
 began to be a war again between the Nephites and the

8
00:00:10,641 --> 00:00:11,974
 Lamanites. And notwithstanding I being young, was

9
00:00:11,974 --> 00:00:13,307
 large in stature; therefore the people of Nephi

10
00:00:13,307 --> 00:00:14,64
 appointed me that I should be their leader, or the

11
00:00:14,64 --> 00:00:15,973
 leader of their armies

12
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,949
2 Therefore it came to pass that in my sixteenth

13
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:19,949
 year I did go forth at the head of an army of the

14
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:21,949
 Nephites, against the Lamanites; therefore three

15
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:23,949
 hundred and twenty and six years had passed away

16
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,257
3 And it came to pass that in the three hundred

17
00:00:25,257 --> 00:00:26,59
 and twenty and seventh year the Lamanites did come

18
00:00:26,59 --> 00:00:27,923
 upon us with exceedingly great power, insomuch that

19
00:00:27,923 --> 00:00:29,256
 they did frighten my armies; therefore they would

20
00:00:29,256 --> 00:00:30,589
 not fight, and they began to retreat towards the

21
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:31,922
 north countries

22
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,042
4 And it came to pass that we did come to the city

23
00:00:33,042 --> 00:00:34,185
 of Angola, and we did take possession of the

24
00:00:34,185 --> 00:00:35,328
 city, and make preparations to defend ourselves

25
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,471
 against the Lamanites. And it came to pass that we did

26
00:00:36,471 --> 00:00:37,614
 fortify the city with our might; but

27
00:00:37,614 --> 00:00:38,757
 notwithstanding all our fortifications the Lamanites did come

28
00:00:38,757 --> 00:00:39,9
 upon us and did drive us out of the city

29
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:43,873
5 And they did also drive us forth out of the land

30
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:47,873
 of David

31
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:50,515
6 And we marched forth and came to the land of

32
00:00:50,515 --> 00:00:53,182
 Joshua, which was in the borders west by the

33
00:00:53,182 --> 00:00:55,849
 seashore

34
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:58,489
7 And it came to pass that we did gather in our

35
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:01,156
 people as fast as it were possible, that we might

36
00:01:01,156 --> 00:01:03,823
 get them together in one body

37
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,575
8 But behold, the land was filled with robbers and

38
00:01:05,575 --> 00:01:07,353
 with Lamanites; and notwithstanding the great

39
00:01:07,353 --> 00:01:09,131
 destruction which hung over my people, they did not

40
00:01:09,131 --> 00:01:10,909
 repent of their evil doings; therefore there was

41
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:12,687
 blood and carnage spread throughout all the face of

42
00:01:12,687 --> 00:01:14,465
 the land, both on the part of the Nephites and

43
00:01:14,465 --> 00:01:16,243
 also on the part of the Lamanites; and it was one

44
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:18,021
 complete revolution throughout all the face of the

45
00:01:18,021 --> 00:01:19,799
 land

46
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:20,889
9 And now, the Lamanites had a king, and his name

47
00:01:20,889 --> 00:01:22,032
 was Aaron; and he came against us with an army of

48
00:01:22,032 --> 00:01:23,175
 forty and four thousand. And behold, I withstood

49
00:01:23,175 --> 00:01:24,318
 him with forty and two thousand. And it came to

50
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:25,461
 pass that I beat him with my army that he fled before

51
00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:26,604
 me. And behold, all this was done, and three

52
00:01:26,604 --> 00:01:27,747
 hundred and thirty years had passed away

53
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:28,864
10 And it came to pass that the Nephites began to

54
00:01:28,864 --> 00:01:30,007
 repent of their iniquity, and began to cry even as

55
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:31,15
 had been prophesied by Samuel the prophet; for

56
00:01:31,15 --> 00:01:32,293
 behold no man could keep that which was his own, for

57
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:33,436
 the thieves, and the robbers, and the murderers,

58
00:01:33,436 --> 00:01:34,579
 and the magic art, and the witchcraft which was in

59
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:35,722
 the land

60
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:41,029
11 Thus there began to be a mourning and a

61
00:01:41,029 --> 00:01:46,362
 lamentation in all the land because of these things, and

62
00:01:46,362 --> 00:01:51,695
 more especially among the people of Nephi

63
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:53,931
12 And it came to pass that when I, Mormon, saw

64
00:01:53,931 --> 00:01:56,217
 their lamentation and their mourning and their

65
00:01:56,217 --> 00:01:58,503
 sorrow before the Lord, my heart did begin to rejoice

66
00:01:58,503 --> 00:02:00,789
 within me, knowing the mercies and the

67
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:03,075
 long-suffering of the Lord, therefore supposing that he would

68
00:02:03,075 --> 00:02:05,361
 be merciful unto them that they would again become

69
00:02:05,361 --> 00:02:07,647
 a righteous people

70
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:10,794
13 But behold this my joy was vain, for their

71
00:02:10,794 --> 00:02:13,994
 sorrowing was not unto repentance, because of the

72
00:02:13,994 --> 00:02:17,194
 goodness of God; but it was rather the sorrowing of

73
00:02:17,194 --> 00:02:20,394
 the damned, because the Lord would not always suffer

74
00:02:20,394 --> 00:02:23,594
 them to take happiness in sin

75
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:27,543
14 And they did not come unto Jesus with broken

76
00:02:27,543 --> 00:02:31,543
 hearts and contrite spirits, but they did curse God,

77
00:02:31,543 --> 00:02:35,543
 and wish to die. Nevertheless they would struggle

78
00:02:35,543 --> 00:02:39,543
 with the sword for their lives

79
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:40,636
15 And it came to pass that my sorrow did return

80
00:02:40,636 --> 00:02:41,779
 unto me again, and I saw that the day of grace was

81
00:02:41,779 --> 00:02:42,922
 passed with them, both temporally and spiritually;

82
00:02:42,922 --> 00:02:44,065
 for I saw thousands of them hewn down in open

83
00:02:44,065 --> 00:02:45,208
 rebellion against their God, and heaped up as dung

84
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,351
 upon the face of the land. And thus three hundred

85
00:02:46,351 --> 00:02:47,494
 and forty and four years had passed away

86
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:50,667
16 And it came to pass that in the three hundred

87
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:53,867
 and forty and fifth year the Nephites did begin to

88
00:02:53,867 --> 00:02:57,067
 flee before the Lamanites; and they were pursued

89
00:02:57,067 --> 00:03:00,267
 until they came even to the land of Jashon, before

90
00:03:00,267 --> 00:03:03,467
 it was possible to stop them in their retreat

91
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:04,75
17 And now, the city of Jashon was near the land

92
00:03:04,75 --> 00:03:06,083
 where Ammaron had deposited the records unto the

93
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,416
 Lord, that they might not be destroyed. And behold I

94
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:08,749
 had gone according to the word of Ammaron, and

95
00:03:08,749 --> 00:03:10,082
 taken the plates of Nephi, and did make a record

96
00:03:10,082 --> 00:03:11,415
 according to the words of Ammaron

97
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:12,534
18 And upon the plates of Nephi I did make a full

98
00:03:12,534 --> 00:03:13,677
 account of all the wickedness and abominations;

99
00:03:13,677 --> 00:03:14,82
 but upon these plates I did forbear to make a full

100
00:03:14,82 --> 00:03:15,963
 account of their wickedness and abominations, for

101
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:17,106
 behold, a continual scene of wickedness and

102
00:03:17,106 --> 00:03:18,249
 abominations has been before mine eyes ever since I have

103
00:03:18,249 --> 00:03:19,392
 been sufficient to behold the ways of man

104
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,366
19 And wo is me because of their wickedness; for

105
00:03:21,366 --> 00:03:23,366
 my heart has been filled with sorrow because of

106
00:03:23,366 --> 00:03:25,366
 their wickedness, all my days; nevertheless, I know

107
00:03:25,366 --> 00:03:27,366
 that I shall be lifted up at the last day

108
00:03:27,34 --> 00:03:29,34
20 And it came to pass that in this year the

109
00:03:29,34 --> 00:03:31,34
 people of Nephi again were hunted and driven. And it

110
00:03:31,34 --> 00:03:33,34
 came to pass that we were driven forth until we had

111
00:03:33,34 --> 00:03:35,34
 come northward to the land which was called Shem

112
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,315
21 And it came to pass that we did fortify the

113
00:03:37,315 --> 00:03:39,315
 city of Shem, and we did gather in our people as much

114
00:03:39,315 --> 00:03:41,315
 as it were possible, that perhaps we might save

115
00:03:41,315 --> 00:03:43,315
 them from destruction

116
00:03:43,29 --> 00:03:45,957
22 And it came to pass in the three hundred and

117
00:03:45,957 --> 00:03:48,624
 forty and sixth year they began to come upon us

118
00:03:48,624 --> 00:03:51,291
 again

119
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:56,064
23 And it came to pass that I did speak unto my

120
00:03:56,064 --> 00:04:00,864
 people, and did urge them with great energy, that

121
00:04:00,864 --> 00:04:05,664
 they would stand boldly before the Lamanites and

122
00:04:05,664 --> 00:04:10,464
 fight for their wives, and their children, and their

123
00:04:10,464 --> 00:04:15,264
 houses, and their homes

124
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,188
24 And my words did arouse them somewhat to vigor,

125
00:04:17,188 --> 00:04:19,188
 insomuch that they did not flee from before the

126
00:04:19,188 --> 00:04:21,188
 Lamanites, but did stand with boldness against

127
00:04:21,188 --> 00:04:23,188
 them

128
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:24,763
25 And it came to pass that we did contend with an

129
00:04:24,763 --> 00:04:26,363
 army of thirty thousand against an army of fifty

130
00:04:26,363 --> 00:04:27,963
 thousand. And it came to pass that we did stand

131
00:04:27,963 --> 00:04:29,563
 before them with such firmness that they did flee

132
00:04:29,563 --> 00:04:31,163
 from before us

133
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:33,424
26 And it came to pass that when they had fled we

134
00:04:33,424 --> 00:04:35,71
 did pursue them with our armies, and did meet them

135
00:04:35,71 --> 00:04:37,996
 again, and did beat them; nevertheless the

136
00:04:37,996 --> 00:04:40,282
 strength of the Lord was not with us; yea, we were left

137
00:04:40,282 --> 00:04:42,568
 to ourselves, that the Spirit of the Lord did not

138
00:04:42,568 --> 00:04:44,854
 abide in us; therefore we had become weak like

139
00:04:44,854 --> 00:04:47,14
 unto our brethren

140
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:48,42
27 And my heart did sorrow because of this the

141
00:04:48,42 --> 00:04:49,753
 great calamity of my people, because of their

142
00:04:49,753 --> 00:04:51,086
 wickedness and their abominations. But behold, we did go

143
00:04:51,086 --> 00:04:52,419
 forth against the Lamanites and the robbers of

144
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:53,752
 Gadianton, until we had again taken possession of the

145
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:55,085
 lands of our inheritance

146
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,661
28 And the three hundred and forty and ninth year

147
00:04:56,661 --> 00:04:58,261
 had passed away. And in the three hundred and

148
00:04:58,261 --> 00:04:59,861
 fiftieth year we made a treaty with the Lamanites and

149
00:04:59,861 --> 00:05:01,461
 the robbers of Gadianton, in which we did get the

150
00:05:01,461 --> 00:05:03,061
 lands of our inheritance divided

151
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:03,036
29 And the Lamanites did give unto us the land

152
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:03,036
 northward, yea, even to the narrow passage which led

153
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:03,036
 into the land southward. And we did give unto the

154
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:03,036
 Lamanites all the land southward.
