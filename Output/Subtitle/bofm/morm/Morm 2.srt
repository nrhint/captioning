Chapter 2 Mormon leads the Nephite armies—Blood

2
00:00:03,0 --> 00:00:06,0
and carnage sweep the land—The Nephites lament

3
00:00:06,0 --> 00:00:09,0
and mourn with the sorrowing of the

4
00:00:09,0 --> 00:00:12,0
damned—Their day of grace is passed—Mormon obtains the

5
00:00:12,0 --> 00:00:15,482
plates of Nephi—Wars continue. About A.D. 327–50. 

6
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:16,482
1 And it came to pass in that same year there

7
00:00:16,482 --> 00:00:17,482
began to be a war again between the Nephites

8
00:00:17,482 --> 00:00:18,482
and the Lamanites. And notwithstanding I

9
00:00:18,482 --> 00:00:19,482
being young, was large in stature; therefore the

10
00:00:19,482 --> 00:00:20,482
people of Nephi appointed me that I should

11
00:00:20,482 --> 00:00:21,822
be their leader, or the leader of their armies.

12
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:24,622
2 Therefore it came to pass that in my

13
00:00:24,622 --> 00:00:27,422
sixteenth year I did go forth at the

14
00:00:27,422 --> 00:00:30,222
head of an army of the Nephites, against

15
00:00:30,222 --> 00:00:33,022
the Lamanites; therefore three hundred

16
00:00:33,022 --> 00:00:35,636
and twenty and six years had passed away.

17
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:35,493
3 And it came to pass that in the

18
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:35,35
three hundred and twenty and seventh year

19
00:00:35,35 --> 00:00:35,207
the Lamanites did come upon us with

20
00:00:35,207 --> 00:00:35,064
exceedingly great power, insomuch that

21
00:00:35,064 --> 00:00:34,921
they did frighten my armies; therefore

22
00:00:34,921 --> 00:00:34,778
they would not fight, and they began

23
00:00:34,778 --> 00:00:34,701
to retreat towards the north countries.

24
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:35,257
4 And it came to pass that we did

25
00:00:35,257 --> 00:00:35,813
come to the city of Angola, and we did

26
00:00:35,813 --> 00:00:36,369
take possession of the city, and make

27
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:36,925
preparations to defend ourselves

28
00:00:36,925 --> 00:00:37,481
against the Lamanites. And it came to

29
00:00:37,481 --> 00:00:38,037
pass that we did fortify the city with

30
00:00:38,037 --> 00:00:38,593
our might; but notwithstanding all our

31
00:00:38,593 --> 00:00:39,149
fortifications the Lamanites did

32
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:39,106
come upon us and did drive us out of the city.

33
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:41,106
5 And they did also drive us

34
00:00:41,106 --> 00:00:43,51
forth out of the land of David.

35
00:00:43,51 --> 00:00:45,51
6 And we marched forth

36
00:00:45,51 --> 00:00:47,51
and came to the land of

37
00:00:47,51 --> 00:00:49,51
Joshua, which was in the

38
00:00:49,51 --> 00:00:51,952
borders west by the seashore.

39
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:51,952
7 And it came to pass

40
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:51,952
that we did gather

41
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:51,952
in our people as fast

42
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:51,952
as it were possible,

43
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:51,952
that we might get

44
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:51,018
them together in one body.

45
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:50,968
8 But behold, the

46
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:50,918
land was filled with

47
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:50,868
robbers and with

48
00:00:50,868 --> 00:00:50,818
Lamanites; and

49
00:00:50,818 --> 00:00:50,768
notwithstanding the great

50
00:00:50,768 --> 00:00:50,718
destruction which hung

51
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:50,668
over my people, they

52
00:00:50,668 --> 00:00:50,618
did not repent of

53
00:00:50,618 --> 00:00:50,568
their evil doings;

54
00:00:50,568 --> 00:00:50,518
therefore there was

55
00:00:50,518 --> 00:00:50,468
blood and carnage

56
00:00:50,468 --> 00:00:50,418
spread throughout all

57
00:00:50,418 --> 00:00:50,368
the face of the land,

58
00:00:50,368 --> 00:00:50,318
both on the part of

59
00:00:50,318 --> 00:00:50,268
the Nephites and

60
00:00:50,268 --> 00:00:50,218
also on the part of the

61
00:00:50,218 --> 00:00:50,168
Lamanites; and it

62
00:00:50,168 --> 00:00:50,118
was one complete

63
00:00:50,118 --> 00:00:50,068
revolution throughout

64
00:00:50,068 --> 00:00:50,083
all the face of the land.

65
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:50,318
9 And now, the

66
00:00:50,318 --> 00:00:50,553
Lamanites had a king,

67
00:00:50,553 --> 00:00:50,788
and his name was

68
00:00:50,788 --> 00:00:51,023
Aaron; and he came

69
00:00:51,023 --> 00:00:51,258
against us with an

70
00:00:51,258 --> 00:00:51,493
army of forty and four

71
00:00:51,493 --> 00:00:51,728
thousand. And

72
00:00:51,728 --> 00:00:51,963
behold, I withstood him

73
00:00:51,963 --> 00:00:52,198
with forty and two

74
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:52,433
thousand. And it

75
00:00:52,433 --> 00:00:52,668
came to pass that I

76
00:00:52,668 --> 00:00:52,903
beat him with my

77
00:00:52,903 --> 00:00:53,138
army that he fled

78
00:00:53,138 --> 00:00:53,373
before me. And behold,

79
00:00:53,373 --> 00:00:53,608
all this was done,

80
00:00:53,608 --> 00:00:53,843
and three hundred

81
00:00:53,843 --> 00:00:54,488
and thirty years had passed away.

82
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:55,312
10 And it came to

83
00:00:55,312 --> 00:00:56,136
pass that the

84
00:00:56,136 --> 00:00:56,96
Nephites began to

85
00:00:56,96 --> 00:00:57,784
repent of their

86
00:00:57,784 --> 00:00:58,608
iniquity, and began to

87
00:00:58,608 --> 00:00:59,432
cry even as had

88
00:00:59,432 --> 00:01:00,256
been prophesied by

89
00:01:00,256 --> 00:01:01,08
Samuel the prophet;

90
00:01:01,08 --> 00:01:01,904
for behold no man

91
00:01:01,904 --> 00:01:02,728
could keep that

92
00:01:02,728 --> 00:01:03,552
which was his own,

93
00:01:03,552 --> 00:01:04,376
for the thieves,

94
00:01:04,376 --> 00:01:05,2
and the robbers, and

95
00:01:05,2 --> 00:01:06,024
the murderers,

96
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:06,848
and the magic art,

97
00:01:06,848 --> 00:01:07,672
and the witchcraft

98
00:01:07,672 --> 00:01:08,769
which was in the land.

99
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:10,894
11 Thus there

100
00:01:10,894 --> 00:01:13,019
began to be a

101
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:15,144
mourning and a

102
00:01:15,144 --> 00:01:17,269
lamentation in all the

103
00:01:17,269 --> 00:01:19,394
land because of

104
00:01:19,394 --> 00:01:21,519
these things, and

105
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:23,644
more especially

106
00:01:23,644 --> 00:01:25,185
among the people of Nephi.

107
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:25,29
12 And it came

108
00:01:25,29 --> 00:01:25,395
to pass that when

109
00:01:25,395 --> 00:01:25,5
I, Mormon, saw

110
00:01:25,5 --> 00:01:25,605
their

111
00:01:25,605 --> 00:01:25,71
lamentation and their

112
00:01:25,71 --> 00:01:25,815
mourning and their

113
00:01:25,815 --> 00:01:25,92
sorrow before the

114
00:01:25,92 --> 00:01:26,025
Lord, my heart

115
00:01:26,025 --> 00:01:26,13
did begin to

116
00:01:26,13 --> 00:01:26,235
rejoice within me,

117
00:01:26,235 --> 00:01:26,34
knowing the

118
00:01:26,34 --> 00:01:26,445
mercies and the

119
00:01:26,445 --> 00:01:26,55
long-suffering of

120
00:01:26,55 --> 00:01:26,655
the Lord,

121
00:01:26,655 --> 00:01:26,76
therefore supposing that

122
00:01:26,76 --> 00:01:26,865
he would be

123
00:01:26,865 --> 00:01:26,97
merciful unto them

124
00:01:26,97 --> 00:01:27,075
that they would

125
00:01:27,075 --> 00:01:27,588
again become a righteous people.

126
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:28,988
13 But behold

127
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:30,388
this my joy was

128
00:01:30,388 --> 00:01:31,788
vain, for their

129
00:01:31,788 --> 00:01:33,188
sorrowing was

130
00:01:33,188 --> 00:01:34,588
not unto

131
00:01:34,588 --> 00:01:35,988
repentance, because

132
00:01:35,988 --> 00:01:37,388
of the goodness

133
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:38,788
of God; but it

134
00:01:38,788 --> 00:01:40,188
was rather the

135
00:01:40,188 --> 00:01:41,588
sorrowing of

136
00:01:41,588 --> 00:01:42,988
the damned,

137
00:01:42,988 --> 00:01:44,388
because the Lord

138
00:01:44,388 --> 00:01:45,788
would not always

139
00:01:45,788 --> 00:01:47,188
suffer them to

140
00:01:47,188 --> 00:01:48,942
take happiness in sin.

141
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,404
14 And they

142
00:01:50,404 --> 00:01:51,866
did not come

143
00:01:51,866 --> 00:01:53,328
unto Jesus with

144
00:01:53,328 --> 00:01:54,79
broken hearts

145
00:01:54,79 --> 00:01:56,252
and contrite

146
00:01:56,252 --> 00:01:57,714
spirits, but

147
00:01:57,714 --> 00:01:59,176
they did curse

148
00:01:59,176 --> 00:02:00,638
God, and wish to

149
00:02:00,638 --> 00:02:02,1
die.

150
00:02:02,1 --> 00:02:03,562
Nevertheless they

151
00:02:03,562 --> 00:02:05,024
would struggle

152
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:06,486
with the sword

153
00:02:06,486 --> 00:02:07,26
for their lives.

154
00:02:07,26 --> 00:02:07,66
15 And it

155
00:02:07,66 --> 00:02:08,06
came to pass

156
00:02:08,06 --> 00:02:08,46
that my sorrow

157
00:02:08,46 --> 00:02:08,86
did return

158
00:02:08,86 --> 00:02:09,26
unto me again,

159
00:02:09,26 --> 00:02:09,66
and I saw that

160
00:02:09,66 --> 00:02:10,06
the day of

161
00:02:10,06 --> 00:02:10,46
grace was

162
00:02:10,46 --> 00:02:10,86
passed with them,

163
00:02:10,86 --> 00:02:11,26
both

164
00:02:11,26 --> 00:02:11,66
temporally and

165
00:02:11,66 --> 00:02:12,06
spiritually; for I

166
00:02:12,06 --> 00:02:12,46
saw

167
00:02:12,46 --> 00:02:12,86
thousands of them

168
00:02:12,86 --> 00:02:13,26
hewn down in

169
00:02:13,26 --> 00:02:13,66
open rebellion

170
00:02:13,66 --> 00:02:14,06
against their

171
00:02:14,06 --> 00:02:14,46
God, and

172
00:02:14,46 --> 00:02:14,86
heaped up as dung

173
00:02:14,86 --> 00:02:15,26
upon the

174
00:02:15,26 --> 00:02:15,66
face of the

175
00:02:15,66 --> 00:02:16,06
land. And thus

176
00:02:16,06 --> 00:02:16,46
three hundred

177
00:02:16,46 --> 00:02:16,86
and forty and

178
00:02:16,86 --> 00:02:17,637
four years had passed away.

179
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:17,584
16 And it

180
00:02:17,584 --> 00:02:17,531
came to pass

181
00:02:17,531 --> 00:02:17,478
that in the

182
00:02:17,478 --> 00:02:17,425
three hundred

183
00:02:17,425 --> 00:02:17,373
and forty

184
00:02:17,373 --> 00:02:17,319
and fifth

185
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:17,266
year the

186
00:02:17,266 --> 00:02:17,213
Nephites did begin

187
00:02:17,213 --> 00:02:17,16
to flee

188
00:02:17,16 --> 00:02:17,107
before the

189
00:02:17,107 --> 00:02:17,054
Lamanites; and

190
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:17,001
they were

191
00:02:17,001 --> 00:02:16,948
pursued until

192
00:02:16,948 --> 00:02:16,895
they came

193
00:02:16,895 --> 00:02:16,843
even to the

194
00:02:16,843 --> 00:02:16,789
land of Jashon,

195
00:02:16,789 --> 00:02:16,736
before it

196
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:16,683
was possible

197
00:02:16,683 --> 00:02:16,703
to stop them in their retreat.

198
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:16,661
17 And now,

199
00:02:16,661 --> 00:02:16,619
the city

200
00:02:16,619 --> 00:02:16,577
of Jashon

201
00:02:16,577 --> 00:02:16,535
was near the

202
00:02:16,535 --> 00:02:16,493
land where

203
00:02:16,493 --> 00:02:16,451
Ammaron had

204
00:02:16,451 --> 00:02:16,409
deposited

205
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:16,367
the records

206
00:02:16,367 --> 00:02:16,325
unto the

207
00:02:16,325 --> 00:02:16,283
Lord, that

208
00:02:16,283 --> 00:02:16,241
they might

209
00:02:16,241 --> 00:02:16,199
not be

210
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:16,157
destroyed. And

211
00:02:16,157 --> 00:02:16,115
behold I had

212
00:02:16,115 --> 00:02:16,073
gone

213
00:02:16,073 --> 00:02:16,031
according to the

214
00:02:16,031 --> 00:02:15,989
word of

215
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:15,947
Ammaron, and

216
00:02:15,947 --> 00:02:15,905
taken the

217
00:02:15,905 --> 00:02:15,863
plates of

218
00:02:15,863 --> 00:02:15,821
Nephi, and

219
00:02:15,821 --> 00:02:15,779
did make a

220
00:02:15,779 --> 00:02:15,737
record

221
00:02:15,737 --> 00:02:15,769
according to the words of Ammaron.

222
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:15,863
18 And

223
00:02:15,863 --> 00:02:15,957
upon the

224
00:02:15,957 --> 00:02:16,051
plates of

225
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:16,145
Nephi I did

226
00:02:16,145 --> 00:02:16,239
make a full

227
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:16,333
account of

228
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:16,427
all the

229
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:16,521
wickedness

230
00:02:16,521 --> 00:02:16,615
and

231
00:02:16,615 --> 00:02:16,709
abominations;

232
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:16,803
but upon

233
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:16,897
these plates

234
00:02:16,897 --> 00:02:16,991
I did

235
00:02:16,991 --> 00:02:17,085
forbear to

236
00:02:17,085 --> 00:02:17,179
make a full

237
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:17,273
account of

238
00:02:17,273 --> 00:02:17,367
their

239
00:02:17,367 --> 00:02:17,461
wickedness and

240
00:02:17,461 --> 00:02:17,555


241
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:17,649
abominations, for

242
00:02:17,649 --> 00:02:17,743
behold, a

243
00:02:17,743 --> 00:02:17,837
continual

244
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:17,931
scene of

245
00:02:17,931 --> 00:02:18,025
wickedness

246
00:02:18,025 --> 00:02:18,119
and

247
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:18,213
abominations has

248
00:02:18,213 --> 00:02:18,307
been

249
00:02:18,307 --> 00:02:18,401
before mine

250
00:02:18,401 --> 00:02:18,495
eyes ever

251
00:02:18,495 --> 00:02:18,589
since I have

252
00:02:18,589 --> 00:02:18,683
been

253
00:02:18,683 --> 00:02:18,171
sufficient to behold the ways of man.

254
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:18,121
19 And wo

255
00:02:18,121 --> 00:02:18,071

256
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:18,021
because of

257
00:02:18,021 --> 00:02:17,971
their

258
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:17,921
wickedness;

259
00:02:17,921 --> 00:02:17,871
for my

260
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,821
heart has

261
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:17,771
been

262
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:17,721
filled with

263
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:17,671
sorrow

264
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:17,621
because of

265
00:02:17,621 --> 00:02:17,571
their

266
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:17,521
wickedness,

267
00:02:17,521 --> 00:02:17,471
all my

268
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:17,421
days;

269
00:02:17,421 --> 00:02:17,371
nevertheless, I

270
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:17,321
know that

271
00:02:17,321 --> 00:02:17,271
I shall

272
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:17,221
be lifted

273
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:17,237
up at the last day.

274
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:17,194
20 And

275
00:02:17,194 --> 00:02:17,151
it came

276
00:02:17,151 --> 00:02:17,108
to pass

277
00:02:17,108 --> 00:02:17,065

00:02:17,065 --> 00:02:17,022
this year

279
00:02:17,022 --> 00:02:16,979
the

280
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:16,936
people of

281
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:16,893
Nephi

282
00:02:16,893 --> 00:02:16,85
again were

283
00:02:16,85 --> 00:02:16,807
hunted

284
00:02:16,807 --> 00:02:16,764
and

285
00:02:16,764 --> 00:02:16,721
driven. And

286
00:02:16,721 --> 00:02:16,678
it came

287
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:16,635
to pass

288
00:02:16,635 --> 00:02:16,592
that we

289
00:02:16,592 --> 00:02:16,549
were

290
00:02:16,549 --> 00:02:16,506
driven forth

291
00:02:16,506 --> 00:02:16,463
until

292
00:02:16,463 --> 00:02:16,42
we had

293
00:02:16,42 --> 00:02:16,377

294
00:02:16,377 --> 00:02:16,334

296
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:16,303
which was called Shem.

297
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:16,258
21 And

298
00:02:16,258 --> 00:02:16,213
it came

299
00:02:16,213 --> 00:02:16,168
to

300
00:02:16,168 --> 00:02:16,123
pass that

301
00:02:16,123 --> 00:02:16,078
we did

302
00:02:16,078 --> 00:02:16,033
fortify

303
00:02:16,033 --> 00:02:15,988

304
00:02:15,988 --> 00:02:15,943
city of

305
00:02:15,943 --> 00:02:15,898
Shem,

306
00:02:15,898 --> 00:02:15,853
and we

307
00:02:15,853 --> 00:02:15,808
did

308
00:02:15,808 --> 00:02:15,763
gather in

309
00:02:15,763 --> 00:02:15,718

311
00:02:15,673 --> 00:02:15,628

316
00:02:15,448 --> 00:02:15,403
perhaps we

317
00:02:15,403 --> 00:02:15,358
might

318
00:02:15,358 --> 00:02:15,369
save them from destruction.

319
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:15,502
