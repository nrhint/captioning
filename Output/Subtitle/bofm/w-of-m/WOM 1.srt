00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:31,75
The Words of MormonChapter 1 Mormon abridges the

2
00:00:31,75 --> 00:01:03,5
 large plates of Nephi—He puts the small plates with

3
00:01:03,5 --> 00:01:35,25
 the other plates—King Benjamin establishes peace

4
00:01:35,25 --> 00:02:07,0
 in the land. About A.D. 385.

5
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:15,594
1 And now I, Mormon, being about to deliver up the

6
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:23,594
 record which I have been making into the hands of

7
00:02:23,594 --> 00:02:31,594
 my son Moroni, behold I have witnessed almost all

8
00:02:31,594 --> 00:02:39,594
 the destruction of my people, the Nephites

9
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:39,618
2 And it is many hundred years after the coming of

10
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:39,743
 Christ that I deliver these records into the

11
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:39,868
 hands of my son; and it supposeth me that he will

12
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:39,993
 witness the entire destruction of my people. But may

13
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:40,118
 God grant that he may survive them, that he may

14
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:40,243
 write somewhat concerning them, and somewhat

15
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:40,368
 concerning Christ, that perhaps some day it may profit

16
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:40,493
 them

17
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:44,261
3 And now, I speak somewhat concerning that which

18
00:02:44,261 --> 00:02:47,928
 I have written; for after I had made an abridgment

19
00:02:47,928 --> 00:02:51,595
 from the plates of Nephi, down to the reign of

20
00:02:51,595 --> 00:02:55,262
 this king Benjamin, of whom Amaleki spake, I

21
00:02:55,262 --> 00:02:58,929
 searched among the records which had been delivered into

22
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:02,596
 my hands, and I found these plates, which

23
00:03:02,596 --> 00:03:06,263
 contained this small account of the prophets, from Jacob

24
00:03:06,263 --> 00:03:09,93
 down to the reign of this king Benjamin, and also

25
00:03:09,93 --> 00:03:13,597
 many of the words of Nephi

26
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:25,156
4 And the things which are upon these plates

27
00:03:25,156 --> 00:03:36,585
 pleasing me, because of the prophecies of the coming of

28
00:03:36,585 --> 00:03:48,014
 Christ; and my fathers knowing that many of them

29
00:03:48,014 --> 00:03:59,443
 have been fulfilled; yea, and I also know that as

30
00:03:59,443 --> 00:04:10,872
 many things as have been prophesied concerning us

31
00:04:10,872 --> 00:04:22,301
 down to this day have been fulfilled, and as many

32
00:04:22,301 --> 00:04:33,73
 as go beyond this day must surely come to pass

33
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:33,723
5 Wherefore, I chose these things, to finish my

34
00:04:33,723 --> 00:04:33,973
 record upon them, which remainder of my record I

35
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:34,223
 shall take from the plates of Nephi; and I cannot

36
00:04:34,223 --> 00:04:34,473
 write the hundredth part of the things of my people

37
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:40,007
6 But behold, I shall take these plates, which

38
00:04:40,007 --> 00:04:45,807
 contain these prophesyings and revelations, and put

39
00:04:45,807 --> 00:04:51,607
 them with the remainder of my record, for they are

40
00:04:51,607 --> 00:04:57,407
 choice unto me; and I know they will be choice

41
00:04:57,407 --> 00:05:03,207
 unto my brethren

42
00:05:03,77 --> 00:05:18,437
7 And I do this for a wise purpose; for thus it

43
00:05:18,437 --> 00:05:33,104
 whispereth me, according to the workings of the

44
00:05:33,104 --> 00:05:47,771
 Spirit of the Lord which is in me. And now, I do not

45
00:05:47,771 --> 00:06:02,438
 know all things; but the Lord knoweth all things

46
00:06:02,438 --> 00:06:17,105
 which are to come; wherefore, he worketh in me to do

47
00:06:17,105 --> 00:06:31,772
 according to his will

48
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:33,491
8 And my prayer to God is concerning my brethren,

49
00:06:33,491 --> 00:06:35,491
 that they may once again come to the knowledge of

50
00:06:35,491 --> 00:06:37,491
 God, yea, the redemption of Christ; that they may

51
00:06:37,491 --> 00:06:39,491
 once again be a delightsome people

52
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:59,466
9 And now I, Mormon, proceed to finish out my

53
00:06:59,466 --> 00:07:19,466
 record, which I take from the plates of Nephi; and I

54
00:07:19,466 --> 00:07:39,466
 make it according to the knowledge and the

55
00:07:39,466 --> 00:07:59,466
 understanding which God has given me

56
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:17,712
10 Wherefore, it came to pass that after Amaleki

57
00:08:17,712 --> 00:08:36,212
 had delivered up these plates into the hands of

58
00:08:36,212 --> 00:08:54,712
 king Benjamin, he took them and put them with the

59
00:08:54,712 --> 00:09:13,212
 other plates, which contained records which had been

60
00:09:13,212 --> 00:09:31,712
 handed down by the kings, from generation to

61
00:09:31,712 --> 00:09:50,212
 generation until the days of king Benjamin

62
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:55,301
11 And they were handed down from king Benjamin,

63
00:09:55,301 --> 00:09:59,745
 from generation to generation until they have

64
00:09:59,745 --> 00:10:04,189
 fallen into my hands. And I, Mormon, pray to God that

65
00:10:04,189 --> 00:10:08,633
 they may be preserved from this time henceforth.

66
00:10:08,633 --> 00:10:13,077
 And I know that they will be preserved; for there

67
00:10:13,077 --> 00:10:17,521
 are great things written upon them, out of which my

68
00:10:17,521 --> 00:10:21,965
 people and their brethren shall be judged at the

69
00:10:21,965 --> 00:10:26,409
 great and last day, according to the word of God

70
00:10:26,409 --> 00:10:30,853
 which is written

71
00:10:30,73 --> 00:11:10,73
12 And now, concerning this king Benjamin—he had

72
00:11:10,73 --> 00:11:50,73
 somewhat of contentions among his own people

73
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:18,261
15 And it came to pass that after there had been

74
00:02:18,261 --> 00:02:28,928
 false Christs, and their mouths had been shut, and

75
00:02:28,928 --> 00:02:39,595
 they punished according to their crimes

76
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:40,493
16 And after there had been false prophets, and

77
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,493
 false preachers and teachers among the people, and

78
00:02:41,493 --> 00:02:42,493
 all these having been punished according to their

79
00:02:42,493 --> 00:02:43,493
 crimes; and after there having been much contention

80
00:02:43,493 --> 00:02:44,493
 and many dissensions away unto the Lamanites,

81
00:02:44,493 --> 00:02:45,493
 behold, it came to pass that king Benjamin, with the

82
00:02:45,493 --> 00:02:46,493
 assistance of the holy prophets who were among his

83
00:02:46,493 --> 00:02:47,493
 people

84
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:50,134
17 For behold, king Benjamin was a holy man, and

85
00:02:50,134 --> 00:02:52,801
 he did reign over his people in righteousness; and

86
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:55,468
 there were many holy men in the land, and they did

87
00:02:55,468 --> 00:02:58,135
 speak the word of God with power and with

88
00:02:58,135 --> 00:03:00,802
 authority; and they did use much sharpness because of the

89
00:03:00,802 --> 00:03:03,469
 stiffneckedness of the people

90
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:03,667
18 Wherefore, with the help of these, king

91
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:03,917
 Benjamin, by laboring with all the might of his body and

92
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:04,167
 the faculty of his whole soul, and also the

93
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:04,417
 prophets, did once more establish peace in the land.
