The Words of MormonChapter 1 Mormon abridges

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the large plates of Nephi—He puts the small

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
plates with the other plates—King Benjamin

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:06:55,
establishes peace in the land. About A.D. 385. 

5
00:06:55,0 --> 00:06:55,0
1 And now I, Mormon, being about to

6
00:06:55,0 --> 00:06:55,0
deliver up the record which I have been

7
00:06:55,0 --> 00:06:55,0
making into the hands of my son

8
00:06:55,0 --> 00:06:55,0
Moroni, behold I have witnessed almost all

9
00:06:55,0 --> 00:08:25,
the destruction of my people, the Nephites.

10
00:08:25,0 --> 00:08:25,0
2 And it is many hundred years

11
00:08:25,0 --> 00:08:25,0
after the coming of Christ that I

12
00:08:25,0 --> 00:08:25,0
deliver these records into the hands of

13
00:08:25,0 --> 00:08:25,0
my son; and it supposeth me that he

14
00:08:25,0 --> 00:08:25,0
will witness the entire

15
00:08:25,0 --> 00:08:25,0
destruction of my people. But may God grant

16
00:08:25,0 --> 00:08:25,0
that he may survive them, that he

17
00:08:25,0 --> 00:08:25,0
may write somewhat concerning them,

18
00:08:25,0 --> 00:08:25,0
and somewhat concerning Christ, that

19
00:08:25,0 --> 00:10:09,
perhaps some day it may profit them.

20
00:10:09,0 --> 00:10:09,0
3 And now, I speak somewhat

21
00:10:09,0 --> 00:10:09,0
concerning that which I have

22
00:10:09,0 --> 00:10:09,0
written; for after I had made an

23
00:10:09,0 --> 00:10:09,0
abridgment from the plates of Nephi,

24
00:10:09,0 --> 00:10:09,0
down to the reign of this king

25
00:10:09,0 --> 00:10:09,0
Benjamin, of whom Amaleki spake, I

26
00:10:09,0 --> 00:10:09,0
searched among the records

27
00:10:09,0 --> 00:10:09,0
which had been delivered into my

28
00:10:09,0 --> 00:10:09,0
hands, and I found these plates,

29
00:10:09,0 --> 00:10:09,0
which contained this small account

30
00:10:09,0 --> 00:10:09,0
of the prophets, from Jacob

31
00:10:09,0 --> 00:10:09,0
down to the reign of this king

32
00:10:09,0 --> 00:11:53,
Benjamin, and also many of the words of Nephi.

33
00:11:53,0 --> 00:11:53,0
4 And the things which are upon

34
00:11:53,0 --> 00:11:53,0
these plates pleasing me,

35
00:11:53,0 --> 00:11:53,0
because of the prophecies of the

36
00:11:53,0 --> 00:11:53,0
coming of Christ; and my fathers

37
00:11:53,0 --> 00:11:53,0
knowing that many of them have

38
00:11:53,0 --> 00:11:53,0
been fulfilled; yea, and I also

39
00:11:53,0 --> 00:11:53,0
know that as many things as

40
00:11:53,0 --> 00:11:53,0
have been prophesied concerning

41
00:11:53,0 --> 00:11:53,0
us down to this day have been

42
00:11:53,0 --> 00:11:53,0
fulfilled, and as many as go

43
00:11:53,0 --> 00:16:50,
beyond this day must surely come to pass—

44
00:16:50,0 --> 00:16:50,0
5 Wherefore, I chose these

45
00:16:50,0 --> 00:16:50,0
things, to finish my record

46
00:16:50,0 --> 00:16:50,0
upon them, which remainder of

47
00:16:50,0 --> 00:16:50,0
my record I shall take from

48
00:16:50,0 --> 00:16:50,0
the plates of Nephi; and I

49
00:16:50,0 --> 00:16:50,0
cannot write the hundredth

50
00:16:50,0 --> 00:16:22,
part of the things of my people.

51
00:16:22,0 --> 00:16:22,0
6 But behold, I shall take

52
00:16:22,0 --> 00:16:22,0
these plates, which

53
00:16:22,0 --> 00:16:22,0
contain these prophesyings and

54
00:16:22,0 --> 00:16:22,0
revelations, and put them

55
00:16:22,0 --> 00:16:22,0
with the remainder of my

56
00:16:22,0 --> 00:16:22,0
record, for they are choice

57
00:16:22,0 --> 00:16:22,0
unto me; and I know they

58
00:16:22,0 --> 00:15:54,
will be choice unto my brethren.

59
00:15:54,0 --> 00:15:54,0
7 And I do this for a

60
00:15:54,0 --> 00:15:54,0
wise purpose; for thus it

61
00:15:54,0 --> 00:15:54,0
whispereth me, according

62
00:15:54,0 --> 00:15:54,0
to the workings of the

63
00:15:54,0 --> 00:15:54,0
Spirit of the Lord which

64
00:15:54,0 --> 00:15:54,0
is in me. And now, I do

65
00:15:54,0 --> 00:15:54,0
not know all things;

66
00:15:54,0 --> 00:15:54,0
but the Lord knoweth all

67
00:15:54,0 --> 00:15:54,0
things which are to come;

68
00:15:54,0 --> 00:15:54,0
wherefore, he worketh

69
00:15:54,0 --> 00:16:08,
in me to do according to his will.

70
00:16:08,0 --> 00:16:08,0
8 And my prayer to God

71
00:16:08,0 --> 00:16:08,0
is concerning my

72
00:16:08,0 --> 00:16:08,0
brethren, that they may once

73
00:16:08,0 --> 00:16:08,0
again come to the

74
00:16:08,0 --> 00:16:08,0
knowledge of God, yea, the

75
00:16:08,0 --> 00:16:08,0
redemption of Christ;

76
00:16:08,0 --> 00:16:08,0
that they may once again

77
00:16:08,0 --> 00:18:20,
be a delightsome people.

78
00:18:20,0 --> 00:18:20,0
9 And now I, Mormon,

79
00:18:20,0 --> 00:18:20,0
proceed to finish out

80
00:18:20,0 --> 00:18:20,0
my record, which I take

81
00:18:20,0 --> 00:18:20,0
from the plates of

82
00:18:20,0 --> 00:18:20,0
Nephi; and I make it

83
00:18:20,0 --> 00:18:20,0
according to the

84
00:18:20,0 --> 00:18:20,0
knowledge and the

85
00:18:20,0 --> 00:33:48,
understanding which God has given me.

86
00:33:48,0 --> 00:33:48,0
10 Wherefore, it

87
00:33:48,0 --> 00:33:48,0
came to pass that after

88
00:33:48,0 --> 00:33:48,0
Amaleki had

89
00:33:48,0 --> 00:33:48,0
delivered up these plates

90
00:33:48,0 --> 00:33:48,0
into the hands of

91
00:33:48,0 --> 00:33:48,0
king Benjamin, he took

92
00:33:48,0 --> 00:33:48,0
them and put them

93
00:33:48,0 --> 00:33:48,0
with the other plates,

94
00:33:48,0 --> 00:33:48,0
which contained

95
00:33:48,0 --> 00:33:48,0
records which had been

96
00:33:48,0 --> 00:33:48,0
handed down by the

97
00:33:48,0 --> 00:33:48,0
kings, from

98
00:33:48,0 --> 00:33:48,0
generation to generation

99
00:33:48,0 --> 00:43:43,
until the days of king Benjamin.

100
00:43:43,0 --> 00:43:43,0
11 And they were

101
00:43:43,0 --> 00:43:43,0
handed down from king

102
00:43:43,0 --> 00:43:43,0
Benjamin, from

103
00:43:43,0 --> 00:43:43,0
generation to

104
00:43:43,0 --> 00:43:43,0
generation until they have

105
00:43:43,0 --> 00:43:43,0
fallen into my

106
00:43:43,0 --> 00:43:43,0
hands. And I, Mormon,

107
00:43:43,0 --> 00:43:43,0
pray to God that

108
00:43:43,0 --> 00:43:43,0
they may be preserved

109
00:43:43,0 --> 00:43:43,0
from this time

110
00:43:43,0 --> 00:43:43,0
henceforth. And I know

111
00:43:43,0 --> 00:43:43,0
that they will be

112
00:43:43,0 --> 00:43:43,0
preserved; for there

113
00:43:43,0 --> 00:43:43,0
are great things

114
00:43:43,0 --> 00:43:43,0
written upon them,

115
00:43:43,0 --> 00:43:43,0
out of which my

116
00:43:43,0 --> 00:43:43,0
people and their

117
00:43:43,0 --> 00:43:43,0
brethren shall be judged

118
00:43:43,0 --> 00:43:43,0
at the great and

119
00:43:43,0 --> 00:43:43,0
last day, according

120
00:43:43,0 --> 00:54:36,
to the word of God which is written.

121
00:54:36,0 --> 00:54:36,0
12 And now,

122
00:54:36,0 --> 00:54:36,0
concerning this king

123
00:54:36,0 --> 00:54:36,0
Benjamin—he had

124
00:54:36,0 --> 00:54:36,0
somewhat of contentions

125
00:54:36,0 --> 00:59:46,
among his own people.

126
00:59:46,0 --> 00:59:46,0
13 And it came to

127
00:59:46,0 --> 00:59:46,0
pass also that

128
00:59:46,0 --> 00:59:46,0
the armies of the

129
00:59:46,0 --> 00:59:46,0
Lamanites came

130
00:59:46,0 --> 00:59:46,0
down out of the

131
00:59:46,0 --> 00:59:46,0
land of Nephi, to

132
00:59:46,0 --> 00:59:46,0
battle against his

133
00:59:46,0 --> 00:59:46,0
people. But

134
00:59:46,0 --> 00:59:46,0
behold, king Benjamin

135
00:59:46,0 --> 00:59:46,0
gathered together

136
00:59:46,0 --> 00:59:46,0
his armies, and

137
00:59:46,0 --> 00:59:46,0
he did stand

138
00:59:46,0 --> 00:59:46,0
against them; and he

139
00:59:46,0 --> 00:59:46,0
did fight with

140
00:59:46,0 --> 00:59:46,0
the strength of his

141
00:59:46,0 --> 00:59:46,0
own arm, with

142
00:59:46,0 --> 01:09:13,
the sword of Laban.

143
01:09:13,0 --> 01:09:13,0
14 And in the

144
01:09:13,0 --> 01:09:13,0
strength of the

145
01:09:13,0 --> 01:09:13,0
Lord they did

146
01:09:13,0 --> 01:09:13,0
contend against

147
01:09:13,0 --> 01:09:13,0
their enemies, until

148
01:09:13,0 --> 01:09:13,0
they had slain

149
01:09:13,0 --> 01:09:13,0
many thousands

150
01:09:13,0 --> 01:09:13,0
of the Lamanites.

151
01:09:13,0 --> 01:09:13,0
And it came to

152
01:09:13,0 --> 01:09:13,0
pass that they

153
01:09:13,0 --> 01:09:13,0
did contend

154
01:09:13,0 --> 01:09:13,0
against the Lamanites

155
01:09:13,0 --> 01:09:13,0
until they had

156
01:09:13,0 --> 01:09:13,0
driven them out

157
01:09:13,0 --> 01:09:13,0
of all the lands

158
01:09:13,0 --> 01:30:19,
of their inheritance.

159
01:30:19,0 --> 01:30:19,0
15 And it came

160
01:30:19,0 --> 01:30:19,0
to pass that

161
01:30:19,0 --> 01:30:19,0
after there had

162
01:30:19,0 --> 01:30:19,0
been false

163
01:30:19,0 --> 01:30:19,0
Christs, and their

164
01:30:19,0 --> 01:30:19,0
mouths had been

165
01:30:19,0 --> 01:30:19,0
shut, and they

166
01:30:19,0 --> 01:30:19,0
punished

167
01:30:19,0 --> 01:31:49,
according to their crimes;

168
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
16 And after

169
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
there had been

170
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
false

171
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
prophets, and false

172
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
preachers and

173
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
teachers among

174
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
the people, and

175
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
all these

176
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
having been

177
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
punished according

178
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
to their

179
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
crimes; and after

180
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
there having

181
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
been much

182
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
contention and many

183
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
dissensions

184
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
away unto the

185
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
Lamanites,

186
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
behold, it came to

187
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
pass that king

188
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
Benjamin,

189
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
with the

190
01:31:49,0 --> 01:31:49,0
assistance of the holy

191
01:31:49,0 --> 01:35:20,
prophets who were among his people—

192
01:35:20,0 --> 01:35:20,0
17 For

193
01:35:20,0 --> 01:35:20,0
behold, king

194
01:35:20,0 --> 01:35:20,0
Benjamin was a holy

195
01:35:20,0 --> 01:35:20,0
man, and he

196
01:35:20,0 --> 01:35:20,0
did reign

197
01:35:20,0 --> 01:35:20,0
over his people

198
01:35:20,0 --> 01:35:20,0
in

199
01:35:20,0 --> 01:35:20,0
righteousness; and

200
01:35:20,0 --> 01:35:20,0
there were many

201
01:35:20,0 --> 01:35:20,0
holy men in

202
01:35:20,0 --> 01:35:20,0
the land, and

203
01:35:20,0 --> 01:35:20,0
they did speak

204
01:35:20,0 --> 01:35:20,0
the word of

205
01:35:20,0 --> 01:35:20,0
God with

206
01:35:20,0 --> 01:35:20,0
power and with

207
01:35:20,0 --> 01:35:20,0
authority; and

208
01:35:20,0 --> 01:35:20,0
they did use

209
01:35:20,0 --> 01:35:20,0
much

210
01:35:20,0 --> 01:35:20,0
sharpness because of

211
01:35:20,0 --> 01:35:20,0
the

212
01:35:20,0 --> 02:00:26,
stiffneckedness of the people—

213
02:00:26,0 --> 02:00:26,0
18

214
02:00:26,0 --> 02:00:26,0
Wherefore, with the

215
02:00:26,0 --> 02:00:26,0
help of

216
02:00:26,0 --> 02:00:26,0
these, king

217
02:00:26,0 --> 02:00:26,0
Benjamin, by

218
02:00:26,0 --> 02:00:26,0
laboring with

219
02:00:26,0 --> 02:00:26,0
