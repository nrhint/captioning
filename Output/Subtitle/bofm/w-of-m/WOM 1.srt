The Words of MormonChapter 1 Mormon abridges

2
00:00:08,25 --> 00:00:16,5
the large plates of Nephi—He puts the small

3
00:00:16,5 --> 00:00:24,75
plates with the other plates—King Benjamin

4
00:00:24,75 --> 00:00:33,8
establishes peace in the land. About A.D. 385. 

5
00:00:33,8 --> 00:00:33,6
1 And now I, Mormon, being about to

6
00:00:33,6 --> 00:00:33,4
deliver up the record which I have been

7
00:00:33,4 --> 00:00:33,2
making into the hands of my son

8
00:00:33,2 --> 00:00:33,0
Moroni, behold I have witnessed almost all

9
00:00:33,0 --> 00:00:32,866
the destruction of my people, the Nephites.

10
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:32,766
2 And it is many hundred years

11
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:32,666
after the coming of Christ that I

12
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:32,566
deliver these records into the hands of

13
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:32,466
my son; and it supposeth me that he

14
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:32,366
will witness the entire

15
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:32,266
destruction of my people. But may God grant

16
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:32,166
that he may survive them, that he

17
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:32,066
may write somewhat concerning them,

18
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:31,966
and somewhat concerning Christ, that

19
00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:31,932
perhaps some day it may profit them.

20
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:31,855
3 And now, I speak somewhat

21
00:00:31,855 --> 00:00:31,778
concerning that which I have

22
00:00:31,778 --> 00:00:31,701
written; for after I had made an

23
00:00:31,701 --> 00:00:31,624
abridgment from the plates of Nephi,

24
00:00:31,624 --> 00:00:31,547
down to the reign of this king

25
00:00:31,547 --> 00:00:31,47
Benjamin, of whom Amaleki spake, I

26
00:00:31,47 --> 00:00:31,393
searched among the records

27
00:00:31,393 --> 00:00:31,316
which had been delivered into my

28
00:00:31,316 --> 00:00:31,239
hands, and I found these plates,

29
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:31,162
which contained this small account

30
00:00:31,162 --> 00:00:31,085
of the prophets, from Jacob

31
00:00:31,085 --> 00:00:31,008
down to the reign of this king

32
00:00:31,008 --> 00:00:30,998
Benjamin, and also many of the words of Nephi.

33
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:30,998
4 And the things which are upon

34
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:30,998
these plates pleasing me,

35
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:30,998
because of the prophecies of the

36
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:30,998
coming of Christ; and my fathers

37
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:30,998
knowing that many of them have

38
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:30,998
been fulfilled; yea, and I also

39
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:30,998
know that as many things as

40
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:30,998
have been prophesied concerning

41
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:30,998
us down to this day have been

42
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:30,998
fulfilled, and as many as go

43
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:30,53
beyond this day must surely come to pass—

44
00:00:30,53 --> 00:00:31,102
5 Wherefore, I chose these

45
00:00:31,102 --> 00:00:31,672
things, to finish my record

46
00:00:31,672 --> 00:00:32,243
upon them, which remainder of

47
00:00:32,243 --> 00:00:32,815
my record I shall take from

48
00:00:32,815 --> 00:00:33,386
the plates of Nephi; and I

49
00:00:33,386 --> 00:00:33,956
cannot write the hundredth

50
00:00:33,956 --> 00:00:34,001
part of the things of my people.

51
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:33,876
6 But behold, I shall take

52
00:00:33,876 --> 00:00:33,751
these plates, which

53
00:00:33,751 --> 00:00:33,626
contain these prophesyings and

54
00:00:33,626 --> 00:00:33,501
revelations, and put them

55
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:33,376
with the remainder of my

56
00:00:33,376 --> 00:00:33,251
record, for they are choice

57
00:00:33,251 --> 00:00:33,126
unto me; and I know they

58
00:00:33,126 --> 00:00:33,066
will be choice unto my brethren.

59
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:32,975
7 And I do this for a

60
00:00:32,975 --> 00:00:32,884
wise purpose; for thus it

61
00:00:32,884 --> 00:00:32,793
whispereth me, according

62
00:00:32,793 --> 00:00:32,702
to the workings of the

63
00:00:32,702 --> 00:00:32,611
Spirit of the Lord which

64
00:00:32,611 --> 00:00:32,52
is in me. And now, I do

65
00:00:32,52 --> 00:00:32,429
not know all things;

66
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:32,338
but the Lord knoweth all

67
00:00:32,338 --> 00:00:32,247
things which are to come;

68
00:00:32,247 --> 00:00:32,156
wherefore, he worketh

69
00:00:32,156 --> 00:00:32,132
in me to do according to his will.

70
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:32,007
8 And my prayer to God

71
00:00:32,007 --> 00:00:31,882
is concerning my

72
00:00:31,882 --> 00:00:31,757
brethren, that they may once

73
00:00:31,757 --> 00:00:31,632
again come to the

74
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:31,507
knowledge of God, yea, the

75
00:00:31,507 --> 00:00:31,382
redemption of Christ;

76
00:00:31,382 --> 00:00:31,257
that they may once again

77
00:00:31,257 --> 00:00:31,198
be a delightsome people.

78
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:31,073
9 And now I, Mormon,

79
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:30,948
proceed to finish out

80
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:30,823
my record, which I take

81
00:00:30,823 --> 00:00:30,698
from the plates of

82
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:30,573
Nephi; and I make it

83
00:00:30,573 --> 00:00:30,448
according to the

84
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:30,323
knowledge and the

85
00:00:30,323 --> 00:00:30,264
understanding which God has given me.

86
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:30,478
10 Wherefore, it

87
00:00:30,478 --> 00:00:30,692
came to pass that after

88
00:00:30,692 --> 00:00:30,906
Amaleki had

89
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:31,12
delivered up these plates

90
00:00:31,12 --> 00:00:31,334
into the hands of

91
00:00:31,334 --> 00:00:31,548
king Benjamin, he took

92
00:00:31,548 --> 00:00:31,762
them and put them

93
00:00:31,762 --> 00:00:31,976
with the other plates,

94
00:00:31,976 --> 00:00:32,19
which contained

95
00:00:32,19 --> 00:00:32,404
records which had been

96
00:00:32,404 --> 00:00:32,618
handed down by the

97
00:00:32,618 --> 00:00:32,832
kings, from

98
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:33,046
generation to generation

99
00:00:33,046 --> 00:00:33,734
until the days of king Benjamin.

100
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:33,686
11 And they were

101
00:00:33,686 --> 00:00:33,638
handed down from king

102
00:00:33,638 --> 00:00:33,59
Benjamin, from

103
00:00:33,59 --> 00:00:33,542
generation to

104
00:00:33,542 --> 00:00:33,494
generation until they have

105
00:00:33,494 --> 00:00:33,446
fallen into my

106
00:00:33,446 --> 00:00:33,398
hands. And I, Mormon,

107
00:00:33,398 --> 00:00:33,35
pray to God that

108
00:00:33,35 --> 00:00:33,302
they may be preserved

109
00:00:33,302 --> 00:00:33,254
from this time

110
00:00:33,254 --> 00:00:33,206
henceforth. And I know

111
00:00:33,206 --> 00:00:33,158
that they will be

112
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:33,11
preserved; for there

113
00:00:33,11 --> 00:00:33,062
are great things

114
00:00:33,062 --> 00:00:33,014
written upon them,

115
00:00:33,014 --> 00:00:32,966
out of which my

116
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:32,918
people and their

117
00:00:32,918 --> 00:00:32,87
brethren shall be judged

118
00:00:32,87 --> 00:00:32,822
at the great and

119
00:00:32,822 --> 00:00:32,774
last day, according

120
00:00:32,774 --> 00:00:32,799
to the word of God which is written.

121
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:32,599
12 And now,

122
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:32,399
concerning this king

123
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:32,199
Benjamin—he had

124
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:31,999
somewhat of contentions

125
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:31,865
among his own people.

126
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:31,865
13 And it came to

127
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:31,865
pass also that

128
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:31,865
the armies of the

129
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:31,865
Lamanites came

130
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:31,865
down out of the

131
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:31,865
land of Nephi, to

132
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:31,865
battle against his

133
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:31,865
people. But

134
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:31,865
behold, king Benjamin

135
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:31,865
gathered together

136
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:31,865
his armies, and

137
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:31,865
he did stand

138
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:31,865
against them; and he

139
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:31,865
did fight with

140
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:31,865
the strength of his

141
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:31,865
own arm, with

142
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:31,398
the sword of Laban.

143
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:31,336
14 And in the

144
00:00:31,336 --> 00:00:31,274
strength of the

145
00:00:31,274 --> 00:00:31,212
Lord they did

146
00:00:31,212 --> 00:00:31,15
contend against

147
00:00:31,15 --> 00:00:31,088
their enemies, until

148
00:00:31,088 --> 00:00:31,026
they had slain

149
00:00:31,026 --> 00:00:30,964
many thousands

150
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:30,902
of the Lamanites.

151
00:00:30,902 --> 00:00:30,84
And it came to

152
00:00:30,84 --> 00:00:30,778
pass that they

153
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:30,716
did contend

154
00:00:30,716 --> 00:00:30,654
against the Lamanites

155
00:00:30,654 --> 00:00:30,592
until they had

156
00:00:30,592 --> 00:00:30,53
driven them out

157
00:00:30,53 --> 00:00:30,468
of all the lands

158
00:00:30,468 --> 00:00:30,464
of their inheritance.

159
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:30,797
15 And it came

160
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:31,13
to pass that

161
00:00:31,13 --> 00:00:31,463
after there had

162
00:00:31,463 --> 00:00:31,796
been false

163
00:00:31,796 --> 00:00:32,129
Christs, and their

164
00:00:32,129 --> 00:00:32,462
mouths had been

165
00:00:32,462 --> 00:00:32,795
shut, and they

166
00:00:32,795 --> 00:00:33,128
punished

167
00:00:33,128 --> 00:00:33,934
according to their crimes;

168
00:00:33,934 --> 00:00:33,892
16 And after

169
00:00:33,892 --> 00:00:33,85
there had been

170
00:00:33,85 --> 00:00:33,808
false

171
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:33,766
prophets, and false

172
00:00:33,766 --> 00:00:33,724
preachers and

173
00:00:33,724 --> 00:00:33,682
teachers among

174
00:00:33,682 --> 00:00:33,64
the people, and

175
00:00:33,64 --> 00:00:33,598
all these

176
00:00:33,598 --> 00:00:33,556
having been

177
00:00:33,556 --> 00:00:33,514
punished according

178
00:00:33,514 --> 00:00:33,472
to their

179
00:00:33,472 --> 00:00:33,43
crimes; and after

180
00:00:33,43 --> 00:00:33,388
there having

181
00:00:33,388 --> 00:00:33,346
been much

182
00:00:33,346 --> 00:00:33,304
contention and many

183
00:00:33,304 --> 00:00:33,262
dissensions

184
00:00:33,262 --> 00:00:33,22
away unto the

185
00:00:33,22 --> 00:00:33,178
Lamanites,

186
00:00:33,178 --> 00:00:33,136
behold, it came to

187
00:00:33,136 --> 00:00:33,094
pass that king

188
00:00:33,094 --> 00:00:33,052
Benjamin,

189
00:00:33,052 --> 00:00:33,01
with the

190
00:00:33,01 --> 00:00:32,968
assistance of the holy

191
00:00:32,968 --> 00:00:32,0
prophets who were among his people—

192
00:00:32,0 --> 00:00:32,0
17 For

193
00:00:32,0 --> 00:00:32,0
behold, king

194
00:00:32,0 --> 00:00:32,0
Benjamin was a holy

195
00:00:32,0 --> 00:00:32,0
man, and he

196
00:00:32,0 --> 00:00:32,0
did reign

197
00:00:32,0 --> 00:00:32,0
over his people

198
00:00:32,0 --> 00:00:32,0
in

199
00:00:32,0 --> 00:00:32,0
righteousness; and

200
00:00:32,0 --> 00:00:32,0
there were many

201
00:00:32,0 --> 00:00:32,0
holy men in

202
00:00:32,0 --> 00:00:32,0
the land, and

203
00:00:32,0 --> 00:00:32,0
they did speak

204
00:00:32,0 --> 00:00:32,0
the word of

205
00:00:32,0 --> 00:00:32,0
God with

206
00:00:32,0 --> 00:00:32,0
power and with

207
00:00:32,0 --> 00:00:32,0
authority; and

208
00:00:32,0 --> 00:00:32,0
they did use

209
00:00:32,0 --> 00:00:32,0
much

210
00:00:32,0 --> 00:00:32,0
sharpness because of

211
00:00:32,0 --> 00:00:32,0
the

212
00:00:32,0 --> 00:00:32,065
stiffneckedness of the people—

213
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:32,003
18

214
00:00:32,003 --> 00:00:31,941
Wherefore, with the

215
00:00:31,941 --> 00:00:31,879
help of

216
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:31,817
these, king

217
00:00:31,817 --> 00:00:31,755
Benjamin, by

218
00:00:31,755 --> 00:00:31,693
laboring with

219
00:00:31,693 --> 00:00:31,631
all the might

220
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:31,569
of his body

221
00:00:31,569 --> 00:00:31,507
and the

222
00:00:31,507 --> 00:00:31,445
faculty of his

223
00:00:31,445 --> 00:00:31,383
whole soul,

224
00:00:31,383 --> 00:00:31,321
and also the

225
00:00:31,321 --> 00:00:31,259
prophets,

226
00:00:31,259 --> 00:00:31,197
did once more

227
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:31,135
establish

228
00:00:31,135 --> 00:00:31,131
peace in the land.
