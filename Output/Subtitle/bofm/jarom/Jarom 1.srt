The Book of JaromChapter 1 The Nephites

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
keep the law of Moses, look forward to

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the coming of Christ, and prosper in the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
land—Many prophets labor to keep the

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:08:55,
people in the way of truth. About 399–361 B.C. 

6
00:08:55,0 --> 00:08:55,0
1 Now behold, I, Jarom, write

7
00:08:55,0 --> 00:08:55,0
a few words according to the

8
00:08:55,0 --> 00:08:55,0
commandment of my father, Enos,

9
00:08:55,0 --> 00:10:25,
that our genealogy may be kept.

10
00:10:25,0 --> 00:10:25,0
2 And as these plates are

11
00:10:25,0 --> 00:10:25,0
small, and as these things are

12
00:10:25,0 --> 00:10:25,0
written for the intent of

13
00:10:25,0 --> 00:10:25,0
the benefit of our brethren

14
00:10:25,0 --> 00:10:25,0
the Lamanites, wherefore, it

15
00:10:25,0 --> 00:10:25,0
must needs be that I write a

16
00:10:25,0 --> 00:10:25,0
little; but I shall not

17
00:10:25,0 --> 00:10:25,0
write the things of my

18
00:10:25,0 --> 00:10:25,0
prophesying, nor of my revelations.

19
00:10:25,0 --> 00:10:25,0
For what could I write more

20
00:10:25,0 --> 00:10:25,0
than my fathers have

21
00:10:25,0 --> 00:10:25,0
written? For have not they revealed

22
00:10:25,0 --> 00:10:25,0
the plan of salvation? I

23
00:10:25,0 --> 00:12:09,
say unto you, Yea; and this sufficeth me.

24
00:12:09,0 --> 00:12:09,0
3 Behold, it is expedient

25
00:12:09,0 --> 00:12:09,0
that much should be done

26
00:12:09,0 --> 00:12:09,0
among this people, because of

27
00:12:09,0 --> 00:12:09,0
the hardness of their

28
00:12:09,0 --> 00:12:09,0
hearts, and the deafness of

29
00:12:09,0 --> 00:12:09,0
their ears, and the blindness

30
00:12:09,0 --> 00:12:09,0
of their minds, and the

31
00:12:09,0 --> 00:12:09,0
stiffness of their necks;

32
00:12:09,0 --> 00:12:09,0
nevertheless, God is exceedingly

33
00:12:09,0 --> 00:12:09,0
merciful unto them, and

34
00:12:09,0 --> 00:12:09,0
has not as yet swept them off

35
00:12:09,0 --> 00:16:08,
from the face of the land.

36
00:16:08,0 --> 00:16:08,0
4 And there are many

37
00:16:08,0 --> 00:16:08,0
among us who have many

38
00:16:08,0 --> 00:16:08,0
revelations, for they are not

39
00:16:08,0 --> 00:16:08,0
all stiffnecked. And as

40
00:16:08,0 --> 00:16:08,0
many as are not stiffnecked

41
00:16:08,0 --> 00:16:08,0
and have faith, have

42
00:16:08,0 --> 00:16:08,0
communion with the Holy

43
00:16:08,0 --> 00:16:08,0
Spirit, which maketh manifest

44
00:16:08,0 --> 00:16:08,0
unto the children of

45
00:16:08,0 --> 00:15:54,
men, according to their faith.

46
00:15:54,0 --> 00:15:54,0
5 And now, behold, two

47
00:15:54,0 --> 00:15:54,0
hundred years had

48
00:15:54,0 --> 00:15:54,0
passed away, and the people

49
00:15:54,0 --> 00:15:54,0
of Nephi had waxed

50
00:15:54,0 --> 00:15:54,0
strong in the land. They

51
00:15:54,0 --> 00:15:54,0
observed to keep the law

52
00:15:54,0 --> 00:15:54,0
of Moses and the

53
00:15:54,0 --> 00:15:54,0
sabbath day holy unto the

54
00:15:54,0 --> 00:15:54,0
Lord. And they profaned

55
00:15:54,0 --> 00:15:54,0
not; neither did they

56
00:15:54,0 --> 00:15:54,0
blaspheme. And the laws of

57
00:15:54,0 --> 00:19:25,
the land were exceedingly strict.

58
00:19:25,0 --> 00:19:25,0
6 And they were

59
00:19:25,0 --> 00:19:25,0
scattered upon much of the

60
00:19:25,0 --> 00:19:25,0
face of the land,

61
00:19:25,0 --> 00:19:25,0
and the Lamanites also.

62
00:19:25,0 --> 00:19:25,0
And they were

63
00:19:25,0 --> 00:19:25,0
exceedingly more numerous

64
00:19:25,0 --> 00:19:25,0
than were they of the

65
00:19:25,0 --> 00:19:25,0
Nephites; and they

66
00:19:25,0 --> 00:19:25,0
loved murder and would

67
00:19:25,0 --> 00:27:52,
drink the blood of beasts.

68
00:27:52,0 --> 00:27:52,0
7 And it came to

69
00:27:52,0 --> 00:27:52,0
pass that they came

70
00:27:52,0 --> 00:27:52,0
many times against us,

71
00:27:52,0 --> 00:27:52,0
the Nephites, to

72
00:27:52,0 --> 00:27:52,0
battle. But our kings

73
00:27:52,0 --> 00:27:52,0
and our leaders were

74
00:27:52,0 --> 00:27:52,0
mighty men in the

75
00:27:52,0 --> 00:27:52,0
faith of the Lord; and

76
00:27:52,0 --> 00:27:52,0
they taught the

77
00:27:52,0 --> 00:27:52,0
people the ways of the

78
00:27:52,0 --> 00:27:52,0
Lord; wherefore, we

79
00:27:52,0 --> 00:27:52,0
withstood the

80
00:27:52,0 --> 00:27:52,0
Lamanites and swept them

81
00:27:52,0 --> 00:27:52,0
away out of our

82
00:27:52,0 --> 00:27:52,0
lands, and began to

83
00:27:52,0 --> 00:27:52,0
fortify our cities, or

84
00:27:52,0 --> 00:31:23,
whatsoever place of our inheritance.

85
00:31:23,0 --> 00:31:23,0
8 And we multiplied

86
00:31:23,0 --> 00:31:23,0
exceedingly, and

87
00:31:23,0 --> 00:31:23,0
spread upon the face

88
00:31:23,0 --> 00:31:23,0
of the land, and

89
00:31:23,0 --> 00:31:23,0
became exceedingly

90
00:31:23,0 --> 00:31:23,0
rich in gold, and in

91
00:31:23,0 --> 00:31:23,0
silver, and in

92
00:31:23,0 --> 00:31:23,0
precious things, and

93
00:31:23,0 --> 00:31:23,0
in fine workmanship

94
00:31:23,0 --> 00:31:23,0
of wood, in

95
00:31:23,0 --> 00:31:23,0
buildings, and in

96
00:31:23,0 --> 00:31:23,0
machinery, and also in iron

97
00:31:23,0 --> 00:31:23,0
and copper, and

98
00:31:23,0 --> 00:31:23,0
brass and steel,

99
00:31:23,0 --> 00:31:23,0
making all manner of

100
00:31:23,0 --> 00:31:23,0
tools of every kind

101
00:31:23,0 --> 00:31:23,0
to till the ground,

102
00:31:23,0 --> 00:31:23,0
and weapons of

103
00:31:23,0 --> 00:31:23,0
war—yea, the sharp

104
00:31:23,0 --> 00:31:23,0
pointed arrow, and the

105
00:31:23,0 --> 00:31:23,0
quiver, and the

106
00:31:23,0 --> 00:31:23,0
dart, and the javelin,

107
00:31:23,0 --> 00:37:33,
and all preparations for war.

108
00:37:33,0 --> 00:37:33,0
9 And thus being

109
00:37:33,0 --> 00:37:33,0
prepared to meet

110
00:37:33,0 --> 00:37:33,0
the Lamanites, they

111
00:37:33,0 --> 00:37:33,0
did not prosper

112
00:37:33,0 --> 00:37:33,0
against us. But the

113
00:37:33,0 --> 00:37:33,0
word of the Lord

114
00:37:33,0 --> 00:37:33,0
was verified, which

115
00:37:33,0 --> 00:37:33,0
he spake unto our

116
00:37:33,0 --> 00:37:33,0
fathers, saying

117
00:37:33,0 --> 00:37:33,0
that: Inasmuch as

118
00:37:33,0 --> 00:37:33,0
ye will keep my

119
00:37:33,0 --> 00:37:33,0
commandments ye shall

120
00:37:33,0 --> 00:43:15,
prosper in the land.

121
00:43:15,0 --> 00:43:15,0
10 And it came to

122
00:43:15,0 --> 00:43:15,0
pass that the

123
00:43:15,0 --> 00:43:15,0
prophets of the Lord

124
00:43:15,0 --> 00:43:15,0
did threaten the

125
00:43:15,0 --> 00:43:15,0
people of Nephi,

126
00:43:15,0 --> 00:43:15,0
according to the word

127
00:43:15,0 --> 00:43:15,0
of God, that if

128
00:43:15,0 --> 00:43:15,0
they did not keep

129
00:43:15,0 --> 00:43:15,0
the commandments,

130
00:43:15,0 --> 00:43:15,0
but should fall

131
00:43:15,0 --> 00:43:15,0
into transgression,

132
00:43:15,0 --> 00:43:15,0
they should be

133
00:43:15,0 --> 00:43:15,0
destroyed from off the

134
00:43:15,0 --> 00:47:14,
face of the land.

135
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
11 Wherefore, the

136
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
prophets, and

137
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
the priests, and

138
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
the teachers, did

139
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
labor diligently,

140
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
exhorting with

141
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
all long-suffering

142
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
the people to

143
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
diligence; teaching

144
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
the law of Moses,

145
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
and the intent

146
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
for which it was

147
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
given; persuading

148
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
them to look

149
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
forward unto the

150
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
Messiah, and believe

151
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
in him to come as

152
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
though he

153
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
already was. And after

154
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,
this manner did they teach them.

155
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
12 And it came

156
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
to pass that by

157
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
so doing they

158
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
kept them from

159
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
being destroyed upon

160
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
the face of the

161
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
land; for they

162
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
did prick their

163
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
hearts with the

164
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
word,

165
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
continually stirring them

166
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,
up unto repentance.

167
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
13 And it came

168
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
to pass that

169
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
two hundred

170
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
and thirty and

171
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
eight years had

172
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
passed

173
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
away—after the

174
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
manner of wars, and

175
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
contentions,

176
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
and

177
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
dissensions, for the

178
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,
space of much of the time.

179
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
14 And I,

180
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
Jarom, do not

181
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
write more, for

182
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
the plates

183
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
are small. But

184
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
behold, my

185
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
brethren, ye

186
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
can go to the

187
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
other plates

188
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
of Nephi; for

189
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
behold, upon

190
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
them the

191
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
records of our

192
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
wars are

193
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
engraven,

194
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
according to the

195
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
writings of the

196
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
kings, or

197
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
those which they

198
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,
caused to be written.

199
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
15 And I

200
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
deliver these

201
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
plates into

202
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
the hands of

203
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
my son Omni,

204
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
that they

205
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
may be kept

206
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
according to

207
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,0
the

208
00:47:14,0 --> 00:47:14,
commandments of my fathers.
