The Book of JaromChapter 1 The Nephites keep the

2
00:00:17,4 --> 00:00:34,8
 law of Moses, look forward to the coming of Christ,

3
00:00:34,8 --> 00:00:52,2
 and prosper in the land—Many prophets labor to

4
00:00:52,2 --> 00:01:09,6
 keep the people in the way of truth. About

6
00:01:27,721 --> 00:03:16,721
1 Now behold, I, Jarom, write a few words

7
00:03:16,721 --> 00:05:05,721
 according to the commandment of my father, Enos, that our

8
00:05:05,721 --> 00:06:54,721
 genealogy may be kept

9
00:06:54,681 --> 00:07:16,014
2 And as these plates are small, and as these

10
00:07:16,014 --> 00:07:37,347
 things are written for the intent of the benefit of

11
00:07:37,347 --> 00:07:58,68
 our brethren the Lamanites, wherefore, it must needs

12
00:07:58,68 --> 00:08:20,013
 be that I write a little; but I shall not write

13
00:08:20,013 --> 00:08:41,346
 the things of my prophesying, nor of my

14
00:08:41,346 --> 00:09:02,679
 revelations. For what could I write more than my fathers have

15
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:24,012
 written? For have not they revealed the plan of

16
00:09:24,012 --> 00:09:45,345
 salvation? I say unto you, Yea; and this sufficeth

17
00:09:45,345 --> 00:10:06,678
 me

18
00:01:27,721 --> 00:02:22,221
5 And now, behold, two hundred years had passed

19
00:02:22,221 --> 00:03:16,721
 away, and the people of Nephi had waxed strong in

20
00:03:16,721 --> 00:04:11,221
 the land. They observed to keep the law of Moses and

21
00:04:11,221 --> 00:05:05,721
 the sabbath day holy unto the Lord. And they

22
00:05:05,721 --> 00:06:00,221
 profaned not; neither did they blaspheme. And the laws

23
00:06:00,221 --> 00:06:54,721
 of the land were exceedingly strict

24
00:06:54,681 --> 00:07:33,081
6 And they were scattered upon much of the face of

25
00:07:33,081 --> 00:08:11,481
 the land, and the Lamanites also. And they were

26
00:08:11,481 --> 00:08:49,881
 exceedingly more numerous than were they of the

27
00:08:49,881 --> 00:09:28,281
 Nephites; and they loved murder and would drink the

28
00:09:28,281 --> 00:10:06,681
 blood of beasts

29
00:01:27,721 --> 00:02:33,121
9 And thus being prepared to meet the Lamanites,

30
00:02:33,121 --> 00:03:38,521
 they did not prosper against us. But the word of

31
00:03:38,521 --> 00:04:43,921
 the Lord was verified, which he spake unto our

32
00:04:43,921 --> 00:05:49,321
 fathers, saying that: Inasmuch as ye will keep my

33
00:05:49,321 --> 00:06:54,721
 commandments ye shall prosper in the land

34
00:06:54,681 --> 00:07:26,681
10 And it came to pass that the prophets of the

35
00:07:26,681 --> 00:07:58,681
 Lord did threaten the people of Nephi, according to

36
00:07:58,681 --> 00:08:30,681
 the word of God, that if they did not keep the

37
00:08:30,681 --> 00:09:02,681
 commandments, but should fall into transgression,

38
00:09:02,681 --> 00:09:34,681
 they should be destroyed from off the face of the

39
00:09:34,681 --> 00:10:06,681
 land

40
00:01:27,721 --> 00:02:49,471
13 And it came to pass that two hundred and thirty

41
00:02:49,471 --> 00:04:11,221
 and eight years had passed away—after the manner

42
00:04:11,221 --> 00:05:32,971
 of wars, and contentions, and dissensions, for the

43
00:05:32,971 --> 00:06:54,721
 space of much of the time
