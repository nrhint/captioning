The Book of JaromChapter 1 The Nephites

2
00:00:01,4 --> 00:00:02,8
keep the law of Moses, look forward to

3
00:00:02,8 --> 00:00:04,2
the coming of Christ, and prosper in the

4
00:00:04,2 --> 00:00:05,6
land—Many prophets labor to keep the

5
00:00:05,6 --> 00:00:07,975
people in the way of truth. About 399–361 B.C. 

6
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:08,975
1 Now behold, I, Jarom, write

7
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:09,975
a few words according to the

8
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:10,975
commandment of my father, Enos,

9
00:00:10,975 --> 00:00:11,445
that our genealogy may be kept.

10
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:11,588
2 And as these plates are

11
00:00:11,588 --> 00:00:11,731
small, and as these things are

12
00:00:11,731 --> 00:00:11,874
written for the intent of

13
00:00:11,874 --> 00:00:12,017
the benefit of our brethren

14
00:00:12,017 --> 00:00:12,16
the Lamanites, wherefore, it

15
00:00:12,16 --> 00:00:12,303
must needs be that I write a

16
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:12,446
little; but I shall not

17
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:12,589
write the things of my

18
00:00:12,589 --> 00:00:12,732
prophesying, nor of my revelations.

19
00:00:12,732 --> 00:00:12,875
For what could I write more

20
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:13,018
than my fathers have

21
00:00:13,018 --> 00:00:13,161
written? For have not they revealed

22
00:00:13,161 --> 00:00:13,304
the plan of salvation? I

23
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:13,38
say unto you, Yea; and this sufficeth me.

24
00:00:13,38 --> 00:00:14,13
3 Behold, it is expedient

25
00:00:14,13 --> 00:00:14,88
that much should be done

26
00:00:14,88 --> 00:00:15,63
among this people, because of

27
00:00:15,63 --> 00:00:16,38
the hardness of their

28
00:00:16,38 --> 00:00:17,13
hearts, and the deafness of

29
00:00:17,13 --> 00:00:17,88
their ears, and the blindness

30
00:00:17,88 --> 00:00:18,63
of their minds, and the

31
00:00:18,63 --> 00:00:19,38
stiffness of their necks;

32
00:00:19,38 --> 00:00:20,13
nevertheless, God is exceedingly

33
00:00:20,13 --> 00:00:20,88
merciful unto them, and

34
00:00:20,88 --> 00:00:21,63
has not as yet swept them off

35
00:00:21,63 --> 00:00:22,356
from the face of the land.

36
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:22,656
4 And there are many

37
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:22,956
among us who have many

38
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:23,256
revelations, for they are not

39
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:23,556
all stiffnecked. And as

40
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:23,856
many as are not stiffnecked

41
00:00:23,856 --> 00:00:24,156
and have faith, have

42
00:00:24,156 --> 00:00:24,456
communion with the Holy

43
00:00:24,456 --> 00:00:24,756
Spirit, which maketh manifest

44
00:00:24,756 --> 00:00:25,056
unto the children of

45
00:00:25,056 --> 00:00:25,826
men, according to their faith.

46
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:25,993
5 And now, behold, two

47
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:26,16
hundred years had

48
00:00:26,16 --> 00:00:26,327
passed away, and the people

49
00:00:26,327 --> 00:00:26,494
of Nephi had waxed

50
00:00:26,494 --> 00:00:26,661
strong in the land. They

51
00:00:26,661 --> 00:00:26,828
observed to keep the law

52
00:00:26,828 --> 00:00:26,995
of Moses and the

53
00:00:26,995 --> 00:00:27,162
sabbath day holy unto the

54
00:00:27,162 --> 00:00:27,329
Lord. And they profaned

55
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:27,496
not; neither did they

56
00:00:27,496 --> 00:00:27,663
blaspheme. And the laws of

57
00:00:27,663 --> 00:00:27,761
the land were exceedingly strict.

58
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:28,561
6 And they were

59
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:29,361
scattered upon much of the

60
00:00:29,361 --> 00:00:30,161
face of the land,

61
00:00:30,161 --> 00:00:30,961
and the Lamanites also.

62
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:31,761
And they were

63
00:00:31,761 --> 00:00:32,561
exceedingly more numerous

64
00:00:32,561 --> 00:00:33,361
than were they of the

65
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:34,161
Nephites; and they

66
00:00:34,161 --> 00:00:34,961
loved murder and would

67
00:00:34,961 --> 00:00:35,269
drink the blood of beasts.

68
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:35,21
7 And it came to

69
00:00:35,21 --> 00:00:35,151
pass that they came

70
00:00:35,151 --> 00:00:35,092
many times against us,

71
00:00:35,092 --> 00:00:35,033
the Nephites, to

72
00:00:35,033 --> 00:00:34,974
battle. But our kings

73
00:00:34,974 --> 00:00:34,915
and our leaders were

74
00:00:34,915 --> 00:00:34,856
mighty men in the

75
00:00:34,856 --> 00:00:34,797
faith of the Lord; and

76
00:00:34,797 --> 00:00:34,738
they taught the

77
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:34,679
people the ways of the

78
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:34,62
Lord; wherefore, we

79
00:00:34,62 --> 00:00:34,561
withstood the

80
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:34,502
Lamanites and swept them

81
00:00:34,502 --> 00:00:34,443
away out of our

82
00:00:34,443 --> 00:00:34,384
lands, and began to

83
00:00:34,384 --> 00:00:34,325
fortify our cities, or

84
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:34,801
whatsoever place of our inheritance.

85
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:34,975
8 And we multiplied

86
00:00:34,975 --> 00:00:35,149
exceedingly, and

87
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:35,323
spread upon the face

88
00:00:35,323 --> 00:00:35,497
of the land, and

89
00:00:35,497 --> 00:00:35,671
became exceedingly

90
00:00:35,671 --> 00:00:35,845
rich in gold, and in

91
00:00:35,845 --> 00:00:36,019
silver, and in

92
00:00:36,019 --> 00:00:36,193
precious things, and

93
00:00:36,193 --> 00:00:36,367
in fine workmanship

94
00:00:36,367 --> 00:00:36,541
of wood, in

95
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:36,715
buildings, and in

96
00:00:36,715 --> 00:00:36,889
machinery, and also in iron

97
00:00:36,889 --> 00:00:37,063
and copper, and

98
00:00:37,063 --> 00:00:37,237
brass and steel,

99
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:37,411
making all manner of

100
00:00:37,411 --> 00:00:37,585
tools of every kind

101
00:00:37,585 --> 00:00:37,759
to till the ground,

102
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:37,933
and weapons of

103
00:00:37,933 --> 00:00:38,107
war—yea, the sharp

104
00:00:38,107 --> 00:00:38,281
pointed arrow, and the

105
00:00:38,281 --> 00:00:38,455
quiver, and the

106
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:38,629
dart, and the javelin,

107
00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:38,739
and all preparations for war.

108
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:39,354
9 And thus being

109
00:00:39,354 --> 00:00:39,969
prepared to meet

110
00:00:39,969 --> 00:00:40,584
the Lamanites, they

111
00:00:40,584 --> 00:00:41,199
did not prosper

112
00:00:41,199 --> 00:00:41,814
against us. But the

113
00:00:41,814 --> 00:00:42,429
word of the Lord

114
00:00:42,429 --> 00:00:43,044
was verified, which

115
00:00:43,044 --> 00:00:43,659
he spake unto our

116
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:44,274
fathers, saying

117
00:00:44,274 --> 00:00:44,889
that: Inasmuch as

118
00:00:44,889 --> 00:00:45,504
ye will keep my

119
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:46,119
commandments ye shall

120
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:46,68
prosper in the land.

121
00:00:46,68 --> 00:00:47,68
10 And it came to

122
00:00:47,68 --> 00:00:48,68
pass that the

123
00:00:48,68 --> 00:00:49,68
prophets of the Lord

124
00:00:49,68 --> 00:00:50,68
did threaten the

125
00:00:50,68 --> 00:00:51,68
people of Nephi,

126
00:00:51,68 --> 00:00:52,68
according to the word

127
00:00:52,68 --> 00:00:53,68
of God, that if

128
00:00:53,68 --> 00:00:54,68
they did not keep

129
00:00:54,68 --> 00:00:55,68
the commandments,

130
00:00:55,68 --> 00:00:56,68
but should fall

131
00:00:56,68 --> 00:00:57,68
into transgression,

132
00:00:57,68 --> 00:00:58,68
they should be

133
00:00:58,68 --> 00:00:59,68
destroyed from off the

134
00:00:59,68 --> 00:01:00,527
face of the land.

135
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:01,627
11 Wherefore, the

136
00:01:01,627 --> 00:01:02,727
prophets, and

137
00:01:02,727 --> 00:01:03,827
the priests, and

138
00:01:03,827 --> 00:01:04,927
the teachers, did

139
00:01:04,927 --> 00:01:06,027
labor diligently,

140
00:01:06,027 --> 00:01:07,127
exhorting with

141
00:01:07,127 --> 00:01:08,227
all long-suffering

142
00:01:08,227 --> 00:01:09,327
the people to

143
00:01:09,327 --> 00:01:10,427
diligence; teaching

144
00:01:10,427 --> 00:01:11,527
the law of Moses,

145
00:01:11,527 --> 00:01:12,627
and the intent

146
00:01:12,627 --> 00:01:13,727
for which it was

147
00:01:13,727 --> 00:01:14,827
given; persuading

148
00:01:14,827 --> 00:01:15,927
them to look

149
00:01:15,927 --> 00:01:17,027
forward unto the

150
00:01:17,027 --> 00:01:18,127
Messiah, and believe

151
00:01:18,127 --> 00:01:19,227
in him to come as

152
00:01:19,227 --> 00:01:20,327
though he

153
00:01:20,327 --> 00:01:21,427
already was. And after

154
00:01:21,427 --> 00:01:22,316
this manner did they teach them.

155
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:23,149
12 And it came

156
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:23,982
to pass that by

157
00:01:23,982 --> 00:01:24,815
so doing they

158
00:01:24,815 --> 00:01:25,648
kept them from

159
00:01:25,648 --> 00:01:26,481
being destroyed upon

160
00:01:26,481 --> 00:01:27,314
the face of the

161
00:01:27,314 --> 00:01:28,147
land; for they

162
00:01:28,147 --> 00:01:28,98
did prick their

163
00:01:28,98 --> 00:01:29,813
hearts with the

164
00:01:29,813 --> 00:01:30,646
word,

165
00:01:30,646 --> 00:01:31,479
continually stirring them

166
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:32,192
up unto repentance.

167
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:32,109
13 And it came

168
00:01:32,109 --> 00:01:32,026
to pass that

169
00:01:32,026 --> 00:01:31,943
two hundred

170
00:01:31,943 --> 00:01:31,86
and thirty and

171
00:01:31,86 --> 00:01:31,777
eight years had

172
00:01:31,777 --> 00:01:31,694
passed

173
00:01:31,694 --> 00:01:31,611
away—after the

174
00:01:31,611 --> 00:01:31,528
manner of wars, and

175
00:01:31,528 --> 00:01:31,445
contentions,

176
00:01:31,445 --> 00:01:31,362
and

177
00:01:31,362 --> 00:01:31,279
dissensions, for the

178
00:01:31,279 --> 00:01:31,258
space of much of the time.

179
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:31,208
14 And I,

180
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:31,158
Jarom, do not

181
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:31,108
write more, for

182
00:01:31,108 --> 00:01:31,058
the plates

183
00:01:31,058 --> 00:01:31,008
are small. But

184
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:30,958
behold, my

185
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:30,908
brethren, ye

186
00:01:30,908 --> 00:01:30,858
can go to the

187
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:30,808
other plates

188
00:01:30,808 --> 00:01:30,758
of Nephi; for

189
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:30,708
behold, upon

190
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:30,658
them the

191
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:30,608
records of our

192
00:01:30,608 --> 00:01:30,558
wars are

193
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:30,508
engraven,

194
00:01:30,508 --> 00:01:30,458
according to the

195
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:30,408
writings of the

196
00:01:30,408 --> 00:01:30,358
kings, or

197
00:01:30,358 --> 00:01:30,308
those which they

198
00:01:30,308 --> 00:01:30,324
caused to be written.

199
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:30,624
15 And I

200
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:30,924
