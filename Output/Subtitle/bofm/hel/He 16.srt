00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 16 The Nephites who believe Samuel are

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
baptized by Nephi—Samuel cannot be slain with the

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
arrows and stones of the unrepentant Nephites—Some

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
harden their hearts, and others see angels—The

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
unbelievers say it is not reasonable to believe in

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:03:59,
Christ and His coming in Jerusalem. About 6–1 B.C. 

7
00:03:59,0 --> 00:03:59,0
1 And now, it came to pass that there were

8
00:03:59,0 --> 00:03:59,0
many who heard the words of Samuel, the

9
00:03:59,0 --> 00:03:59,0
Lamanite, which he spake upon the walls of the

10
00:03:59,0 --> 00:03:59,0
city. And as many as believed on his word

11
00:03:59,0 --> 00:03:59,0
went forth and sought for Nephi; and when

12
00:03:59,0 --> 00:03:59,0
they had come forth and found him they

13
00:03:59,0 --> 00:03:59,0
confessed unto him their sins and denied not,

14
00:03:59,0 --> 00:04:13,
desiring that they might be baptized unto the Lord.

15
00:04:13,0 --> 00:04:13,0
2 But as many as there were who did not

16
00:04:13,0 --> 00:04:13,0
believe in the words of Samuel were

17
00:04:13,0 --> 00:04:13,0
angry with him; and they cast stones at

18
00:04:13,0 --> 00:04:13,0
him upon the wall, and also many shot

19
00:04:13,0 --> 00:04:13,0
arrows at him as he stood upon the wall;

20
00:04:13,0 --> 00:04:13,0
but the Spirit of the Lord was with

21
00:04:13,0 --> 00:04:13,0
him, insomuch that they could not hit him

22
00:04:13,0 --> 00:03:45,
with their stones neither with their arrows.

23
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
3 Now when they saw that they could

24
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
not hit him, there were many more who

25
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
did believe on his words, insomuch that

26
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:17,
they went away unto Nephi to be baptized.

27
00:03:17,0 --> 00:03:17,0
4 For behold, Nephi was baptizing,

28
00:03:17,0 --> 00:03:17,0
and prophesying, and preaching,

29
00:03:17,0 --> 00:03:17,0
crying repentance unto the people,

30
00:03:17,0 --> 00:03:17,0
showing signs and wonders, working

31
00:03:17,0 --> 00:03:17,0
miracles among the people, that they might

32
00:03:17,0 --> 00:02:49,
know that the Christ must shortly come—

33
00:02:49,0 --> 00:02:49,0
5 Telling them of things which

34
00:02:49,0 --> 00:02:49,0
must shortly come, that they might

35
00:02:49,0 --> 00:02:49,0
know and remember at the time of

36
00:02:49,0 --> 00:02:49,0
their coming that they had been made

37
00:02:49,0 --> 00:02:49,0
known unto them beforehand, to the

38
00:02:49,0 --> 00:02:49,0
intent that they might believe;

39
00:02:49,0 --> 00:02:49,0
therefore as many as believed on

40
00:02:49,0 --> 00:02:49,0
the words of Samuel went forth unto

41
00:02:49,0 --> 00:02:49,0
him to be baptized, for they came

42
00:02:49,0 --> 00:02:21,
repenting and confessing their sins.

43
00:02:21,0 --> 00:02:21,0
6 But the more part of them did

44
00:02:21,0 --> 00:02:21,0
not believe in the words of

45
00:02:21,0 --> 00:02:21,0
Samuel; therefore when they saw

46
00:02:21,0 --> 00:02:21,0
that they could not hit him with

47
00:02:21,0 --> 00:02:21,0
their stones and their arrows,

48
00:02:21,0 --> 00:02:21,0
they cried unto their

49
00:02:21,0 --> 00:02:21,0
captains, saying: Take this fellow and

50
00:02:21,0 --> 00:02:21,0
bind him, for behold he hath a

51
00:02:21,0 --> 00:02:21,0
devil; and because of the power

52
00:02:21,0 --> 00:02:21,0
of the devil which is in him

53
00:02:21,0 --> 00:02:21,0
we cannot hit him with our

54
00:02:21,0 --> 00:02:21,0
stones and our arrows; therefore

55
00:02:21,0 --> 00:04:05,
take him and bind him, and away with him.

56
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
7 And as they went forth to

57
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
lay their hands on him,

58
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
behold, he did cast himself

59
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
down from the wall, and did

60
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
flee out of their lands,

61
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
yea, even unto his own

62
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
country, and began to preach and

63
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,
to prophesy among his own people.

64
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
8 And behold, he was

65
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
never heard of more among the

66
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
Nephites; and thus were

67
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,
the affairs of the people.

68
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
9 And thus ended the

69
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
eighty and sixth year of

70
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
the reign of the judges

71
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,
over the people of Nephi.

72
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
10 And thus ended also

73
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
the eighty and

74
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
seventh year of the reign of

75
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
the judges, the more

76
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
part of the people

77
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
remaining in their pride

78
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
and wickedness, and

79
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
the lesser part walking

80
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,
more circumspectly before God.

81
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
11 And these were

82
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
the conditions also,

83
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
in the eighty and

84
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
eighth year of the

85
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,
reign of the judges.

86
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
12 And there was

87
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
but little

88
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
alteration in the affairs

89
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
of the people,

90
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
save it were the

91
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
people began to be

92
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
more hardened in

93
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
iniquity, and do more

94
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
and more of that

95
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
which was contrary

96
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
to the

97
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
commandments of God, in the

98
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
eighty and ninth

99
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,
year of the reign of the judges.

100
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
13 But it came

101
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
to pass in the

102
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
ninetieth year of

103
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
the reign of the

104
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
judges, there

105
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
were great signs

106
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
given unto the

107
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
people, and

108
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
wonders; and the

109
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
words of the

110
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,
prophets began to be fulfilled.

111
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
14 And angels

112
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
did appear unto

113
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
men, wise men,

114
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
and did declare

115
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
unto them glad

116
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
tidings of

117
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
great joy; thus in

118
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
this year the

119
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
scriptures

120
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,
began to be fulfilled.

121
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
15

122
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
Nevertheless, the people

123
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
began to

124
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
harden their

125
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
hearts, all save it

126
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
were the most

127
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
believing part

128
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
of them, both

129
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
of the

130
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
Nephites and also of

131
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
the

132
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
Lamanites, and began to

133
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
depend upon

134
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
their own

135
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
strength and upon

136
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,
their own wisdom, saying:

137
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
16 Some

138
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
things they may

139
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
have guessed

140
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
right, among so

141
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
many; but

142
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
behold, we know

143
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
that all

144
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
these great and

145
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
marvelous

146
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
works cannot

147
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
come to pass, of

148
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,
which has been spoken.

149
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
17 And they

150
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
began to

151
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
reason and

152
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
to contend

153
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
among

154
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,
themselves, saying:

155
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
18 That it

156
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
is not

157
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
reasonable

158
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
that such a

159
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
being as

160
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
a Christ

161
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
shall come;

162
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
if so,

163
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
and he be

164
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
the Son of

165
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
God, the

166
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
Father of

167
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
heaven and

168
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
of earth,

169
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
as it has

170
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
been

171
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
spoken, why will

172
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
he not

173
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
show himself

174
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
unto us

175
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
as well as

176
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
unto them

177
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,
who shall be at Jerusalem?

178
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
19 Yea,

179
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
why will

180
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
he not

181
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
show himself

182
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
in this

183
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
land as

184
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
well as in

185
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
the land

186
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,
of Jerusalem?

187
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
20 But

188
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
behold,

189
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
we know

190
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
that this

191
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
is a

192
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
wicked

193
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
tradition,

194
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
which

195
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
has been

196
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
handed

197
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
down unto

198
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
us by

199
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
our

200
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
fathers, to

201
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
cause us

202
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
that we

203
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
should

204
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
believe in

205
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
some

206
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
great and

207
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0


208
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
marvelous thing

209
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
which

210
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
should

211
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
come to

212
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
pass, but

213
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
not among

214
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
us, but

215
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
in a

216
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
land which

217
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
is far

218
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
distant,

219
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
a land

220
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
which we

221
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
know

222
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
not;

223
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
therefore

224
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
they can

225
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
keep us in

226
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0


227
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
ignorance, for

228
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
we

229
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,
cannot witness with our own eyes that they are true.

230
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
21 And

231
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
they

232
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
will, by the

233
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
cunning

234
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
and the

235
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0


236
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
mysterious arts

237
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
of the

238
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
evil

239
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
one, work

240
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
some

241
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
great

242
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
mystery which

243
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
we

244
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
cannot

245
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
understand,

246
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
which will

247
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
keep us

248
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
down to

249
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
be

250
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
servants to

251
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
their

252
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
words, and

253
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
also

254
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
servants

255
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
unto

256
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
them, for we

257
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
depend

258
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
upon

259
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
them to

260
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
teach us

261
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
the word;

262
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
and thus

263
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
will

264
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
they keep

265
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
us in

266
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
ignorance

267
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
if we

268
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
will yield

269
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0


270
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
ourselves unto

271
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
them,

272
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
all the

273
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
days of

274
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,
our lives.

275
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
22 And

276
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
many

277
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
more

278
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
things did

279
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
the

280
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
people

281
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
imagine up

282
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
in

283
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
their

284
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
hearts,

285
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
which were

286
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0


287
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
foolish and

288
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
vain;

289
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
and they

290
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
were

291
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
much

292
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
disturbed,

293
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
for

294
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
Satan did

295
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
stir

296
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
them up

297
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
to do

298
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
iniquity

299
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0


300
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
continually;

301
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
yea, he

302
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
did go

303
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
about

304
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0


305
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
spreading

306
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
rumors and

307
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0


308
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
contentions

309
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
upon all

310
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
the face

311
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
of the

312
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
land,

313
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
that he

314
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
might

315
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
harden

316
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
the

317
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
hearts of

318
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
the

319
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
people

320
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
against

321
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,
that which was good and against that which should come.

322
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
23 And

323
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0


324
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0


325
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
notwithstanding

326
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
the

327
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
signs and

328
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
the

329
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
wonders

330
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
which

331
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
were

332
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0


333
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
wrought

334
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
among the

335
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
people

336
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
of

337
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
the

338
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
Lord, and

339
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
the

340
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
many

341
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
miracles

342
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
which

343
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
they

344
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
did,

345
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
Satan

346
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
did get

347
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
great

348
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
hold

349
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
upon

350
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
the

351
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
hearts of

352
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
the

353
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,
people upon all the face of the land.

354
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
24

355
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
And

356
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
thus

357
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
ended

358
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
the

00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
And

thus

372
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0


373
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:05,0
ended
