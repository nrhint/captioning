00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:08,667
Chapter 16 The Nephites who believe Samuel are

2
00:00:08,667 --> 00:00:17,334
 baptized by Nephi—Samuel cannot be slain with the

3
00:00:17,334 --> 00:00:26,001
 arrows and stones of the unrepentant Nephites—Some

4
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:34,668
 harden their hearts, and others see angels—The

5
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:43,335
 unbelievers say it is not reasonable to believe in

6
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:52,002
 Christ and His coming in Jerusalem. About 6–1 B.C.

7
00:00:52,92 --> 00:00:58,17
1 And now, it came to pass that there were many

8
00:00:58,17 --> 00:01:03,42
 who heard the words of Samuel, the Lamanite, which

9
00:01:03,42 --> 00:01:08,67
 he spake upon the walls of the city. And as many as

10
00:01:08,67 --> 00:01:13,92
 believed on his word went forth and sought for

11
00:01:13,92 --> 00:01:19,17
 Nephi; and when they had come forth and found him

12
00:01:19,17 --> 00:01:24,42
 they confessed unto him their sins and denied not,

13
00:01:24,42 --> 00:01:29,67
 desiring that they might be baptized unto the Lord

14
00:01:29,67 --> 00:01:34,92


15
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:39,771
2 But as many as there were who did not believe in

16
00:01:39,771 --> 00:01:44,914
 the words of Samuel were angry with him; and they

17
00:01:44,914 --> 00:01:50,057
 cast stones at him upon the wall, and also many

18
00:01:50,057 --> 00:01:55,2
 shot arrows at him as he stood upon the wall; but

19
00:01:55,2 --> 00:02:00,343
 the Spirit of the Lord was with him, insomuch that

20
00:02:00,343 --> 00:02:05,486
 they could not hit him with their stones neither

21
00:02:05,486 --> 00:02:10,629
 with their arrows

22
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:14,413
3 Now when they saw that they could not hit him,

23
00:02:14,413 --> 00:02:18,663
 there were many more who did believe on his words,

24
00:02:18,663 --> 00:02:22,913
 insomuch that they went away unto Nephi to be

25
00:02:22,913 --> 00:02:27,163
 baptized

26
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:48,614
4 For behold, Nephi was baptizing, and

27
00:02:48,614 --> 00:03:09,414
 prophesying, and preaching, crying repentance unto the

28
00:03:09,414 --> 00:03:30,214
 people, showing signs and wonders, working miracles

29
00:03:30,214 --> 00:03:51,014
 among the people, that they might know that the Christ

30
00:03:51,014 --> 00:04:11,814
 must shortly come

31
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:14,914
5 Telling them of things which must shortly come,

32
00:04:14,914 --> 00:04:18,343
 that they might know and remember at the time of

33
00:04:18,343 --> 00:04:21,772
 their coming that they had been made known unto

34
00:04:21,772 --> 00:04:25,201
 them beforehand, to the intent that they might

35
00:04:25,201 --> 00:04:28,63
 believe; therefore as many as believed on the words of

36
00:04:28,63 --> 00:04:32,059
 Samuel went forth unto him to be baptized, for they

37
00:04:32,059 --> 00:04:35,488
 came repenting and confessing their sins

38
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:35,408
6 But the more part of them did not believe in the

39
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:35,408
 words of Samuel; therefore when they saw that

40
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:35,408
 they could not hit him with their stones and their

41
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:35,408
 arrows, they cried unto their captains, saying: Take

42
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:35,408
 this fellow and bind him, for behold he hath a

43
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:35,408
 devil; and because of the power of the devil which

44
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:35,408
 is in him we cannot hit him with our stones and our

45
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:35,408
 arrows; therefore take him and bind him, and away

46
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:35,408
 with him

47
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:40,009
7 And as they went forth to lay their hands on

48
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:44,209
 him, behold, he did cast himself down from the wall,

49
00:04:44,209 --> 00:04:48,409
 and did flee out of their lands, yea, even unto

50
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:52,609
 his own country, and began to preach and to prophesy

51
00:04:52,609 --> 00:04:56,809
 among his own people

52
00:04:56,863 --> 00:05:01,863
8 And behold, he was never heard of more among the

53
00:05:01,863 --> 00:05:06,863
 Nephites; and thus were the affairs of the

54
00:05:06,863 --> 00:05:11,863
 people

55
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:17,378
9 And thus ended the eighty and sixth year of the

56
00:05:17,378 --> 00:05:23,378
 reign of the judges over the people of Nephi

57
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:27,956
10 And thus ended also the eighty and seventh year

58
00:05:27,956 --> 00:05:32,756
 of the reign of the judges, the more part of the

59
00:05:32,756 --> 00:05:37,556
 people remaining in their pride and wickedness,

60
00:05:37,556 --> 00:05:42,356
 and the lesser part walking more circumspectly

61
00:05:42,356 --> 00:05:47,156
 before God

62
00:05:47,48 --> 00:05:51,48
11 And these were the conditions also, in the

63
00:05:51,48 --> 00:05:55,48
 eighty and eighth year of the reign of the judges

64
00:05:55,455 --> 00:06:00,622
12 And there was but little alteration in the

65
00:06:00,622 --> 00:06:05,789
 affairs of the people, save it were the people began

66
00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:10,956
 to be more hardened in iniquity, and do more and

67
00:06:10,956 --> 00:06:16,123
 more of that which was contrary to the commandments

68
00:06:16,123 --> 00:06:21,29
 of God, in the eighty and ninth year of the reign

69
00:06:21,29 --> 00:06:26,457
 of the judges

70
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:31,902
13 But it came to pass in the ninetieth year of

71
00:06:31,902 --> 00:06:37,652
 the reign of the judges, there were great signs

72
00:06:37,652 --> 00:06:43,402
 given unto the people, and wonders; and the words of

73
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:49,152
 the prophets began to be fulfilled

74
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:55,359
14 And angels did appear unto men, wise men, and

75
00:06:55,359 --> 00:07:01,109
 did declare unto them glad tidings of great joy;

76
00:07:01,109 --> 00:07:06,859
 thus in this year the scriptures began to be

77
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:12,609
 fulfilled

78
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:13,965
15 Nevertheless, the people began to harden their

79
00:07:13,965 --> 00:07:15,565
 hearts, all save it were the most believing part

80
00:07:15,565 --> 00:07:17,165
 of them, both of the Nephites and also of the

81
00:07:17,165 --> 00:07:18,765
 Lamanites, and began to depend upon their own strength

82
00:07:18,765 --> 00:07:20,365
 and upon their own wisdom, saying

83
00:07:20,34 --> 00:07:22,34
16 Some things they may have guessed right, among

84
00:07:22,34 --> 00:07:24,34
 so many; but behold, we know that all these great

85
00:07:24,34 --> 00:07:26,34
 and marvelous works cannot come to pass, of which

86
00:07:26,34 --> 00:07:28,34
 has been spoken

87
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:40,315
17 And they began to reason and to contend among

88
00:07:40,315 --> 00:07:52,315
 themselves, saying

89
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:53,838
18 That it is not reasonable that such a being as

90
00:07:53,838 --> 00:07:55,438
 a Christ shall come; if so, and he be the Son of

91
00:07:55,438 --> 00:07:57,038
 God, the Father of heaven and of earth, as it has

92
00:07:57,038 --> 00:07:58,638
 been spoken, why will he not show himself unto us

93
00:07:58,638 --> 00:08:00,238
 as well as unto them who shall be at Jerusalem

94
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:04,213
19 Yea, why will he not show himself in this land

95
00:08:04,213 --> 00:08:08,213
 as well as in the land of Jerusalem

96
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:09,188
20 But behold, we know that this is a wicked

97
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:10,188
 tradition, which has been handed down unto us by our

98
00:08:10,188 --> 00:08:11,188
 fathers, to cause us that we should believe in some

99
00:08:11,188 --> 00:08:12,188
 great and marvelous thing which should come to

100
00:08:12,188 --> 00:08:13,188
 pass, but not among us, but in a land which is far

101
00:08:13,188 --> 00:08:14,188
 distant, a land which we know not; therefore they

102
00:08:14,188 --> 00:08:15,188
 can keep us in ignorance, for we cannot witness with

103
00:08:15,188 --> 00:08:16,188
 our own eyes that they are true

104
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,162
21 And they will, by the cunning and the

105
00:08:17,162 --> 00:08:18,162
 mysterious arts of the evil one, work some great mystery

106
00:08:18,162 --> 00:08:19,162
 which we cannot understand, which will keep us down

107
00:08:19,162 --> 00:08:20,162
 to be servants to their words, and also servants

108
00:08:20,162 --> 00:08:21,162
 unto them, for we depend upon them to teach us the

109
00:08:21,162 --> 00:08:22,162
 word; and thus will they keep us in ignorance if

110
00:08:22,162 --> 00:08:23,162
 we will yield ourselves unto them, all the days of

111
00:08:23,162 --> 00:08:24,162
 our lives

112
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:26,137
22 And many more things did the people imagine up

113
00:08:26,137 --> 00:08:28,137
 in their hearts, which were foolish and vain; and

114
00:08:28,137 --> 00:08:30,137
 they were much disturbed, for Satan did stir them

115
00:08:30,137 --> 00:08:32,137
 up to do iniquity continually; yea, he did go

116
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:34,137
 about spreading rumors and contentions upon all the

117
00:08:34,137 --> 00:08:36,137
 face of the land, that he might harden the hearts of

118
00:08:36,137 --> 00:08:38,137
 the people against that which was good and

119
00:08:38,137 --> 00:08:40,137
 against that which should come

120
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,686
23 And notwithstanding the signs and the wonders

121
00:08:41,686 --> 00:08:43,286
 which were wrought among the people of the Lord,

122
00:08:43,286 --> 00:08:44,886
 and the many miracles which they did, Satan did get

123
00:08:44,886 --> 00:08:46,486
 great hold upon the hearts of the people upon all

124
00:08:46,486 --> 00:08:48,086
 the face of the land

125
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:52,061
24 And thus ended the ninetieth year of the reign

126
00:08:52,061 --> 00:08:56,061
 of the judges over the people of Nephi

127
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,536
25 And thus ended the book of Helaman, according

128
00:08:57,536 --> 00:08:59,036
 to the record of Helaman and his sons.
