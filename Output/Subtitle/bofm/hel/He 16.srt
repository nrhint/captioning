00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:03,667
Chapter 16 The Nephites who believe Samuel are

2
00:00:03,667 --> 00:00:07,334
baptized by Nephi—Samuel cannot be slain with the

3
00:00:07,334 --> 00:00:11,001
arrows and stones of the unrepentant Nephites—Some

4
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:14,668
harden their hearts, and others see angels—The

5
00:00:14,668 --> 00:00:18,335
unbelievers say it is not reasonable to believe in

6
00:00:18,335 --> 00:00:22,256
Christ and His coming in Jerusalem. About 6–1 B.C. 

7
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:25,006
1 And now, it came to pass that there were

8
00:00:25,006 --> 00:00:27,756
many who heard the words of Samuel, the

9
00:00:27,756 --> 00:00:30,506
Lamanite, which he spake upon the walls of the

10
00:00:30,506 --> 00:00:33,256
city. And as many as believed on his word

11
00:00:33,256 --> 00:00:36,006
went forth and sought for Nephi; and when

12
00:00:36,006 --> 00:00:38,756
they had come forth and found him they

13
00:00:38,756 --> 00:00:41,506
confessed unto him their sins and denied not,

14
00:00:41,506 --> 00:00:44,511
desiring that they might be baptized unto the Lord.

15
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:45,136
2 But as many as there were who did not

16
00:00:45,136 --> 00:00:45,761
believe in the words of Samuel were

17
00:00:45,761 --> 00:00:46,386
angry with him; and they cast stones at

18
00:00:46,386 --> 00:00:47,011
him upon the wall, and also many shot

19
00:00:47,011 --> 00:00:47,636
arrows at him as he stood upon the wall;

20
00:00:47,636 --> 00:00:48,261
but the Spirit of the Lord was with

21
00:00:48,261 --> 00:00:48,886
him, insomuch that they could not hit him

22
00:00:48,886 --> 00:00:49,917
with their stones neither with their arrows.

23
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:58,667
3 Now when they saw that they could

24
00:00:58,667 --> 00:01:07,417
not hit him, there were many more who

25
00:01:07,417 --> 00:01:16,167
did believe on his words, insomuch that

26
00:01:16,167 --> 00:01:24,217
they went away unto Nephi to be baptized.

27
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:25,384
4 For behold, Nephi was baptizing,

28
00:01:25,384 --> 00:01:26,551
and prophesying, and preaching,

29
00:01:26,551 --> 00:01:27,718
crying repentance unto the people,

30
00:01:27,718 --> 00:01:28,885
showing signs and wonders, working

31
00:01:28,885 --> 00:01:30,052
miracles among the people, that they might

32
00:01:30,052 --> 00:01:31,725
know that the Christ must shortly come—

33
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:35,525
5 Telling them of things which

34
00:01:35,525 --> 00:01:39,325
must shortly come, that they might

35
00:01:39,325 --> 00:01:43,125
know and remember at the time of

36
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:46,925
their coming that they had been made

37
00:01:46,925 --> 00:01:50,725
known unto them beforehand, to the

38
00:01:50,725 --> 00:01:54,525
intent that they might believe;

39
00:01:54,525 --> 00:01:58,325
therefore as many as believed on

40
00:01:58,325 --> 00:02:02,125
the words of Samuel went forth unto

41
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:05,925
him to be baptized, for they came

42
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:09,029
repenting and confessing their sins.

43
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:09,952
6 But the more part of them did

44
00:02:09,952 --> 00:02:10,875
not believe in the words of

45
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:11,798
Samuel; therefore when they saw

46
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:12,721
that they could not hit him with

47
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:13,644
their stones and their arrows,

48
00:02:13,644 --> 00:02:14,567
they cried unto their

49
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:15,49
captains, saying: Take this fellow and

50
00:02:15,49 --> 00:02:16,413
bind him, for behold he hath a

51
00:02:16,413 --> 00:02:17,336
devil; and because of the power

52
00:02:17,336 --> 00:02:18,259
of the devil which is in him

53
00:02:18,259 --> 00:02:19,182
we cannot hit him with our

54
00:02:19,182 --> 00:02:20,105
stones and our arrows; therefore

55
00:02:20,105 --> 00:02:21,408
take him and bind him, and away with him.

56
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:21,908
7 And as they went forth to

57
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:22,408
lay their hands on him,

58
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:22,908
behold, he did cast himself

59
00:02:22,908 --> 00:02:23,408
down from the wall, and did

60
00:02:23,408 --> 00:02:23,908
flee out of their lands,

61
00:02:23,908 --> 00:02:24,408
yea, even unto his own

62
00:02:24,408 --> 00:02:24,908
country, and began to preach and

63
00:02:24,908 --> 00:02:25,812
to prophesy among his own people.

64
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:34,062
8 And behold, he was

65
00:02:34,062 --> 00:02:42,312
never heard of more among the

66
00:02:42,312 --> 00:02:50,562
Nephites; and thus were

67
00:02:50,562 --> 00:02:58,178
the affairs of the people.

68
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:07,928
9 And thus ended the

69
00:03:07,928 --> 00:03:17,678
eighty and sixth year of

70
00:03:17,678 --> 00:03:27,428
the reign of the judges

71
00:03:27,428 --> 00:03:37,117
over the people of Nephi.

72
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:42,45
10 And thus ended also

73
00:03:42,45 --> 00:03:47,783
the eighty and

74
00:03:47,783 --> 00:03:53,116
seventh year of the reign of

75
00:03:53,116 --> 00:03:58,449
the judges, the more

76
00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:03,782
part of the people

77
00:04:03,782 --> 00:04:09,115
remaining in their pride

78
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:14,448
and wickedness, and

79
00:04:14,448 --> 00:04:19,781
the lesser part walking

80
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:25,432
more circumspectly before God.

81
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:29,432
11 And these were

82
00:04:29,432 --> 00:04:33,432
the conditions also,

83
00:04:33,432 --> 00:04:37,432
in the eighty and

84
00:04:37,432 --> 00:04:41,432
eighth year of the

85
00:04:41,432 --> 00:04:45,786
reign of the judges.

86
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:46,286
12 And there was

87
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:46,786
but little

88
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:47,286
alteration in the affairs

89
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:47,786
of the people,

90
00:04:47,786 --> 00:04:48,286
save it were the

91
00:04:48,286 --> 00:04:48,786
people began to be

92
00:04:48,786 --> 00:04:49,286
more hardened in

93
00:04:49,286 --> 00:04:49,786
iniquity, and do more

94
00:04:49,786 --> 00:04:50,286
and more of that

95
00:04:50,286 --> 00:04:50,786
which was contrary

96
00:04:50,786 --> 00:04:51,286
to the

97
00:04:51,286 --> 00:04:51,786
commandments of God, in the

98
00:04:51,786 --> 00:04:52,286
eighty and ninth

99
00:04:52,286 --> 00:04:52,125
year of the reign of the judges.

100
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:52,307
13 But it came

101
00:04:52,307 --> 00:04:52,489
to pass in the

102
00:04:52,489 --> 00:04:52,671
ninetieth year of

103
00:04:52,671 --> 00:04:52,853
the reign of the

104
00:04:52,853 --> 00:04:53,035
judges, there

105
00:04:53,035 --> 00:04:53,217
were great signs

106
00:04:53,217 --> 00:04:53,399
given unto the

107
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:53,581
people, and

108
00:04:53,581 --> 00:04:53,763
wonders; and the

109
00:04:53,763 --> 00:04:53,945
words of the

110
00:04:53,945 --> 00:04:54,528
prophets began to be fulfilled.

111
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:55,028
14 And angels

112
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:55,528
did appear unto

113
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:56,028
men, wise men,

114
00:04:56,028 --> 00:04:56,528
and did declare

115
00:04:56,528 --> 00:04:57,028
unto them glad

116
00:04:57,028 --> 00:04:57,528
tidings of

117
00:04:57,528 --> 00:04:58,028
great joy; thus in

118
00:04:58,028 --> 00:04:58,528
this year the

119
00:04:58,528 --> 00:04:59,028
scriptures

120
00:04:59,028 --> 00:04:59,933
began to be fulfilled.

121
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:00,621
15

122
00:05:00,621 --> 00:05:01,309
Nevertheless, the people

123
00:05:01,309 --> 00:05:01,997
began to

124
00:05:01,997 --> 00:05:02,685
harden their

125
00:05:02,685 --> 00:05:03,373
hearts, all save it

126
00:05:03,373 --> 00:05:04,061
were the most

127
00:05:04,061 --> 00:05:04,749
believing part

128
00:05:04,749 --> 00:05:05,437
of them, both

129
00:05:05,437 --> 00:05:06,125
of the

130
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:06,813
Nephites and also of

131
00:05:06,813 --> 00:05:07,501
the

132
00:05:07,501 --> 00:05:08,189
Lamanites, and began to

133
00:05:08,189 --> 00:05:08,877
depend upon

134
00:05:08,877 --> 00:05:09,565
their own

135
00:05:09,565 --> 00:05:10,253
strength and upon

136
00:05:10,253 --> 00:05:10,31
their own wisdom, saying:

137
00:05:10,31 --> 00:05:11,31
16 Some

138
00:05:11,31 --> 00:05:12,31
things they may

139
00:05:12,31 --> 00:05:13,31
have guessed

140
00:05:13,31 --> 00:05:14,31
right, among so

141
00:05:14,31 --> 00:05:15,31
many; but

142
00:05:15,31 --> 00:05:16,31
behold, we know

143
00:05:16,31 --> 00:05:17,31
that all

144
00:05:17,31 --> 00:05:18,31
these great and

145
00:05:18,31 --> 00:05:19,31
marvelous

146
00:05:19,31 --> 00:05:20,31
works cannot

147
00:05:20,31 --> 00:05:21,31
come to pass, of

148
00:05:21,31 --> 00:05:22,689
which has been spoken.

149
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:26,856
17 And they

150
00:05:26,856 --> 00:05:31,023
began to

151
00:05:31,023 --> 00:05:35,19
reason and

152
00:05:35,19 --> 00:05:39,357
to contend

153
00:05:39,357 --> 00:05:43,524
among

154
00:05:43,524 --> 00:05:47,08
themselves, saying:

155
00:05:47,08 --> 00:05:47,428
18 That it

156
00:05:47,428 --> 00:05:47,776
is not

157
00:05:47,776 --> 00:05:48,124
reasonable

158
00:05:48,124 --> 00:05:48,472
that such a

159
00:05:48,472 --> 00:05:48,82
being as

160
00:05:48,82 --> 00:05:49,168
a Christ

161
00:05:49,168 --> 00:05:49,516
shall come;

162
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:49,864
if so,

163
00:05:49,864 --> 00:05:50,212
and he be

164
00:05:50,212 --> 00:05:50,56
the Son of

165
00:05:50,56 --> 00:05:50,908
God, the

166
00:05:50,908 --> 00:05:51,256
Father of

167
00:05:51,256 --> 00:05:51,604
heaven and

168
00:05:51,604 --> 00:05:51,952
of earth,

169
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:52,3
as it has

170
00:05:52,3 --> 00:05:52,648
been

171
00:05:52,648 --> 00:05:52,996
spoken, why will

172
00:05:52,996 --> 00:05:53,344
he not

173
00:05:53,344 --> 00:05:53,692
show himself

174
00:05:53,692 --> 00:05:54,04
unto us

175
00:05:54,04 --> 00:05:54,388
as well as

176
00:05:54,388 --> 00:05:54,736
unto them

177
00:05:54,736 --> 00:05:55,522
who shall be at Jerusalem?

178
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:58,855
19 Yea,

179
00:05:58,855 --> 00:06:02,188
why will

180
00:06:02,188 --> 00:06:05,521
he not

181
00:06:05,521 --> 00:06:08,854
show himself

182
00:06:08,854 --> 00:06:12,187
in this

183
00:06:12,187 --> 00:06:15,52
land as

184
00:06:15,52 --> 00:06:18,853
well as in

185
00:06:18,853 --> 00:06:22,186
the land

186
00:06:22,186 --> 00:06:25,318
of Jerusalem?

187
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:25,853
20 But

188
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:26,388
behold,

189
00:06:26,388 --> 00:06:26,923
we know

190
00:06:26,923 --> 00:06:27,458
that this

191
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:27,993
is a

192
00:06:27,993 --> 00:06:28,528
wicked

193
00:06:28,528 --> 00:06:29,063
tradition,

194
00:06:29,063 --> 00:06:29,598
which

195
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:30,133
has been

196
00:06:30,133 --> 00:06:30,668
handed

197
00:06:30,668 --> 00:06:31,203
down unto

198
00:06:31,203 --> 00:06:31,738
us by

199
00:06:31,738 --> 00:06:32,273
our

200
00:06:32,273 --> 00:06:32,808
fathers, to

201
00:06:32,808 --> 00:06:33,343
cause us

202
00:06:33,343 --> 00:06:33,878
that we

203
00:06:33,878 --> 00:06:34,413
should

204
00:06:34,413 --> 00:06:34,948
believe in

205
00:06:34,948 --> 00:06:35,483
some

206
00:06:35,483 --> 00:06:36,018
great and

207
00:06:36,018 --> 00:06:36,553


208
00:06:36,553 --> 00:06:37,088
marvelous thing

209
00:06:37,088 --> 00:06:37,623
which

210
00:06:37,623 --> 00:06:38,158
should

211
00:06:38,158 --> 00:06:38,693
come to

212
00:06:38,693 --> 00:06:39,228
pass, but

213
00:06:39,228 --> 00:06:39,763
not among

214
00:06:39,763 --> 00:06:40,298
us, but

215
00:06:40,298 --> 00:06:40,833
in a

216
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:41,368
land which

217
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:41,903
is far

218
00:06:41,903 --> 00:06:42,438
distant,

219
00:06:42,438 --> 00:06:42,973
a land

220
00:06:42,973 --> 00:06:43,508
which we

221
00:06:43,508 --> 00:06:44,043
know

222
00:06:44,043 --> 00:06:44,578
not;

223
00:06:44,578 --> 00:06:45,113
therefore

224
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:45,648
they can

225
00:06:45,648 --> 00:06:46,183
keep us in

226
00:06:46,183 --> 00:06:46,718


227
00:06:46,718 --> 00:06:47,253
ignorance, for

228
00:06:47,253 --> 00:06:47,788
we

229
00:06:47,788 --> 00:06:48,775
cannot witness with our own eyes that they are true.

230
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:49,286
21 And

231
00:06:49,286 --> 00:06:49,797
they

232
00:06:49,797 --> 00:06:50,308
will, by the

233
00:06:50,308 --> 00:06:50,819
cunning

234
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:51,33
and the

235
00:06:51,33 --> 00:06:51,841


236
00:06:51,841 --> 00:06:52,352
mysterious arts

237
00:06:52,352 --> 00:06:52,863
of the

238
00:06:52,863 --> 00:06:53,374
evil

239
00:06:53,374 --> 00:06:53,885
one, work

240
00:06:53,885 --> 00:06:54,396
some

241
00:06:54,396 --> 00:06:54,907
great

242
00:06:54,907 --> 00:06:55,418
mystery which

243
00:06:55,418 --> 00:06:55,929
we

244
00:06:55,929 --> 00:06:56,44
cannot

245
00:06:56,44 --> 00:06:56,951
understand,

246
00:06:56,951 --> 00:06:57,462
which will

247
00:06:57,462 --> 00:06:57,973
keep us

248
00:06:57,973 --> 00:06:58,484
down to

249
00:06:58,484 --> 00:06:58,995
be

250
00:06:58,995 --> 00:06:59,506
servants to

251
00:06:59,506 --> 00:07:00,017
their

252
00:07:00,017 --> 00:07:00,528
words, and

253
00:07:00,528 --> 00:07:01,039
also

254
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:01,55
servants

255
00:07:01,55 --> 00:07:02,061
unto

256
00:07:02,061 --> 00:07:02,572
them, for we

257
00:07:02,572 --> 00:07:03,083
depend

258
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:03,594
upon

259
00:07:03,594 --> 00:07:04,105
them to

260
00:07:04,105 --> 00:07:04,616
teach us

261
00:07:04,616 --> 00:07:05,127
the word;

262
00:07:05,127 --> 00:07:05,638
and thus

263
00:07:05,638 --> 00:07:06,149
will

264
00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:06,66
they keep

265
00:07:06,66 --> 00:07:07,171
us in

266
00:07:07,171 --> 00:07:07,682
ignorance

267
00:07:07,682 --> 00:07:08,193
if we

268
00:07:08,193 --> 00:07:08,704
will yield

269
00:07:08,704 --> 00:07:09,215


270
00:07:09,215 --> 00:07:09,726
ourselves unto

271
00:07:09,726 --> 00:07:10,237
them,

272
00:07:10,237 --> 00:07:10,748
all the

273
00:07:10,748 --> 00:07:11,259
days of

274
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:11,765
our lives.

275
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:11,999
22 And

276
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:12,233
many

277
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:12,467
more

278
00:07:12,467 --> 00:07:12,701
things did

279
00:07:12,701 --> 00:07:12,935
the

280
00:07:12,935 --> 00:07:13,169
people

281
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:13,403
imagine up

282
00:07:13,403 --> 00:07:13,637
in

283
00:07:13,637 --> 00:07:13,871
their

284
00:07:13,871 --> 00:07:14,105
hearts,

285
00:07:14,105 --> 00:07:14,339
which were

286
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:14,573


287
00:07:14,573 --> 00:07:14,807
foolish and

288
00:07:14,807 --> 00:07:15,041
vain;

289
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:15,275
and they

290
00:07:15,275 --> 00:07:15,509
were

291
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:15,743
much

292
00:07:15,743 --> 00:07:15,977
disturbed,

293
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:16,211
for

294
00:07:16,211 --> 00:07:16,445
Satan did

295
00:07:16,445 --> 00:07:16,679
stir

296
00:07:16,679 --> 00:07:16,913
them up

297
00:07:16,913 --> 00:07:17,147
to do

298
00:07:17,147 --> 00:07:17,381
iniquity

299
00:07:17,381 --> 00:07:17,615


300
00:07:17,615 --> 00:07:17,849
continually;

301
00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:18,083
yea, he

302
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:18,317
did go

303
00:07:18,317 --> 00:07:18,551
about

304
00:07:18,551 --> 00:07:18,785


305
00:07:18,785 --> 00:07:19,019
spreading

306
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:19,253
rumors and

307
00:07:19,253 --> 00:07:19,487


308
00:07:19,487 --> 00:07:19,721
contentions

309
00:07:19,721 --> 00:07:19,955
upon all

310
00:07:19,955 --> 00:07:20,189
the face

311
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:20,423
of the

312
00:07:20,423 --> 00:07:20,657
land,

313
00:07:20,657 --> 00:07:20,891
that he

314
00:07:20,891 --> 00:07:21,125
might

315
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:21,359
harden

316
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:21,593
the

317
00:07:21,593 --> 00:07:21,827
hearts of

318
00:07:21,827 --> 00:07:22,061
the

319
00:07:22,061 --> 00:07:22,295
people

320
00:07:22,295 --> 00:07:22,529
against

321
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:22,142
that which was good and against that which should come.

322
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:22,58
23 And

323
00:07:22,58 --> 00:07:23,018


324
00:07:23,018 --> 00:07:23,456


325
00:07:23,456 --> 00:07:23,894
notwithstanding

326
00:07:23,894 --> 00:07:24,332
the

327
00:07:24,332 --> 00:07:24,77
signs and

328
00:07:24,77 --> 00:07:25,208
the

00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:25,646
wonders

330
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:26,084
which

331
00:07:26,084 --> 00:07:26,522
were

332
00:07:26,522 --> 00:07:26,96


333
00:07:26,96 --> 00:07:27,398
wrought

334
00:07:27,398 --> 00:07:27,836
among the

336
00:07:28,274 --> 00:07:28,712

00:07:28,712 --> 00:07:29,15
the

00:07:29,15 --> 00:07:29,588
Lord, and

339
00:07:29,588 --> 00:07:30,026
the

340
00:07:30,026 --> 00:07:30,464

341
00:07:30,464 --> 00:07:30,902
miracles

342
00:07:30,902 --> 00:07:31,34
which

343
00:07:31,34 --> 00:07:31,778
they

344
00:07:31,778 --> 00:07:32,216
did,

345
00:07:32,216 --> 00:07:32,654
Satan

346
00:07:32,654 --> 00:07:33,092
did get

And

356
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:37,224
thus
