00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
The Prophecy of Nephi, the Son of Helaman—God

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
threatens the people of Nephi that he will

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
visit them in his anger, to their utter

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
destruction except they repent of their wickedness. God

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
smiteth the people of Nephi with pestilence;

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
they repent and turn unto him. Samuel, a

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Lamanite, prophesies unto the Nephites. Comprising

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
chapters 7 through 16.Chapter 7 Nephi is

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
rejected in the north and returns to Zarahemla—He

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
prays upon his garden tower and then calls upon

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:30:05,
the people to repent or perish. About 23–21 B.C. 

12
00:30:05,0 --> 00:30:05,0
1 Behold, now it came to pass in the

13
00:30:05,0 --> 00:30:05,0
sixty and ninth year of the reign of the

14
00:30:05,0 --> 00:30:05,0
judges over the people of the Nephites, that

15
00:30:05,0 --> 00:30:05,0
Nephi, the son of Helaman, returned to

16
00:30:05,0 --> 00:36:46,
the land of Zarahemla from the land northward.

17
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
2 For he had been forth among the

18
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
people who were in the land northward, and

19
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
did preach the word of God unto them,

20
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,
and did prophesy many things unto them;

21
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
3 And they did reject all his

22
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
words, insomuch that he could not

23
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
stay among them, but returned

24
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,
again unto the land of his nativity.

25
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
4 And seeing the people in a

26
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
state of such awful wickedness, and

27
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
those Gadianton robbers filling

28
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
the judgment-seats—having

29
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
usurped the power and authority of

30
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
the land; laying aside the

31
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
commandments of God, and not in the

32
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
least aright before him; doing no

33
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,
justice unto the children of men;

34
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
5 Condemning the righteous

35
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
because of their righteousness;

36
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
letting the guilty and the wicked

37
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
go unpunished because of their

38
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
money; and moreover to be held

39
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
in office at the head of

40
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
government, to rule and do according

41
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
to their wills, that they might

42
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
get gain and glory of the

43
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
world, and, moreover, that they

44
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
might the more easily commit

45
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
adultery, and steal, and kill, and

46
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,
do according to their own wills—

47
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
6 Now this great iniquity had

48
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
come upon the Nephites, in

49
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
the space of not many years;

50
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
and when Nephi saw it, his

51
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
heart was swollen with sorrow

52
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
within his breast; and he did

53
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,
exclaim in the agony of his soul:

54
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
7 Oh, that I could have had

55
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
my days in the days when my

56
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
father Nephi first came out

57
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
of the land of Jerusalem,

58
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
that I could have joyed with

59
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
him in the promised land;

60
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
then were his people easy to be

61
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
entreated, firm to keep the

62
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
commandments of God, and

63
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
slow to be led to do iniquity;

64
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
and they were quick to

65
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,
hearken unto the words of the Lord—

66
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
8 Yea, if my days could

67
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
have been in those

68
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
days, then would my soul

69
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
have had joy in the

70
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,
righteousness of my brethren.

71
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
9 But behold, I am

72
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
consigned that these

73
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
are my days, and

74
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
that my soul shall be

75
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
filled with sorrow

76
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
because of this the

77
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,
wickedness of my brethren.

78
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
10 And behold, now

79
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
it came to pass

80
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
that it was upon a

81
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
tower, which was in

82
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
the garden of Nephi,

83
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
which was by the

84
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
highway which led to

85
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
the chief market,

86
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
which was in the

87
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
city of Zarahemla;

88
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
therefore, Nephi had

89
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
bowed himself upon

90
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
the tower which was

91
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
in his garden,

92
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
which tower was also

93
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
near unto the garden

94
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,
gate by which led the highway.

95
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
11 And it came to

96
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
pass that there

97
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
were certain men

98
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
passing by and saw

99
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
Nephi as he was

100
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
pouring out his soul

101
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
unto God upon the

102
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
tower; and they ran

103
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
and told the

104
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
people what they had

105
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
seen, and the

106
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
people came together in

107
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
multitudes that

108
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
they might know the

109
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
cause of so great

110
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
mourning for the

111
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,
wickedness of the people.

112
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
12 And now, when

113
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
Nephi arose he

114
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
beheld the multitudes

115
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
of people who had

116
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,
gathered together.

117
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
13 And it came to

118
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
pass that he

119
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
opened his mouth and

120
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
said unto them:

121
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
Behold, why have

122
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
ye gathered

123
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
yourselves together?

124
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
That I may tell

125
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,
you of your iniquities?

126
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
14 Yea, because

127
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
I have got upon

128
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
my tower that I

129
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
might pour out

130
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
my soul unto my

131
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
God, because of

132
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
the exceeding

133
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
sorrow of my heart,

134
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
which is

135
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,
because of your iniquities!

136
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
15 And because

137
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
of my mourning

138
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
and lamentation

139
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
ye have

140
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
gathered yourselves

141
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
together, and do

142
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
marvel; yea,

143
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
and ye have

144
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
great need to

145
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
marvel; yea, ye

146
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
ought to marvel

147
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
because ye are

148
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
given away that

149
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
the devil has got

150
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
so great hold

151
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,
upon your hearts.

152
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
16 Yea, how

153
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
could you have

154
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
given way to

155
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
the enticing of

156
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
him who is

157
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
seeking to hurl

158
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
away your souls

159
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
down to

160
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
everlasting misery

161
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,
and endless wo?

162
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
17 O repent

163
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
ye, repent ye!

164
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
Why will ye

165
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
die? Turn ye,

166
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
turn ye unto

167
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
the Lord

168
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
your God. Why

169
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,
has he forsaken you?

170
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
18 It is

171
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
because you

172
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
have hardened

173
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
your hearts;

174
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
yea, ye will

175
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
not hearken

176
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
unto the

177
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
voice of the

178
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
good

179
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
shepherd; yea, ye

180
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
have provoked

181
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
him to anger

182
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,
against you.

183
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
19 And

184
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
behold, instead

185
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
of

186
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
gathering you,

187
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
except ye will

188
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
repent,

189
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
behold, he

190
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
shall scatter

191
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
you forth

192
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
that ye

193
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
shall become

194
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
meat for

195
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,
dogs and wild beasts.

196
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
20 O, how

197
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
could you

198
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
have

199
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
forgotten your

200
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
God in the

201
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
very day

202
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
that he

203
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,
has delivered you?

204
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
21 But

205
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
behold, it

206
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
is to get

207
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
gain, to

208
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
be

209
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
praised of

210
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
men, yea,

211
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
and that ye

212
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
might

213
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
get gold

214
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
and silver.

215
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
And ye

216
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
have set

217
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
your

218
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
hearts upon

219
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0

293
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0

294
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
other,

295
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0

299
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
repent of

300
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
their

301
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
