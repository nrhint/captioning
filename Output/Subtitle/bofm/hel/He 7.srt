00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:08,545
The Prophecy of Nephi, the Son of Helaman—God

2
00:00:08,545 --> 00:00:17,09
 threatens the people of Nephi that he will visit them

3
00:00:17,09 --> 00:00:25,635
 in his anger, to their utter destruction except

4
00:00:25,635 --> 00:00:34,18
 they repent of their wickedness. God smiteth the

5
00:00:34,18 --> 00:00:42,725
 people of Nephi with pestilence; they repent and turn

6
00:00:42,725 --> 00:00:51,27
 unto him. Samuel, a Lamanite, prophesies unto the

7
00:00:51,27 --> 00:00:59,815
 Nephites. Comprising chapters 7

8
00:00:59,815 --> 00:01:08,36
 through 16.Chapter 7 Nephi is rejected in the north and returns to

9
00:01:08,36 --> 00:01:16,905
 Zarahemla—He prays upon his garden tower and then

10
00:01:16,905 --> 00:01:25,45
 calls upon the people to repent or perish. About

11
00:01:25,45 --> 00:01:33,995
 23–21 B.C.

12
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:38,627
1 Behold, now it came to pass in the sixty and

13
00:01:38,627 --> 00:01:43,227
 ninth year of the reign of the judges over the people

14
00:01:43,227 --> 00:01:47,827
 of the Nephites, that Nephi, the son of Helaman,

15
00:01:47,827 --> 00:01:52,427
 returned to the land of Zarahemla from the land

16
00:01:52,427 --> 00:01:57,027
 northward

17
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:02,451
2 For he had been forth among the people who were

18
00:02:02,451 --> 00:02:06,951
 in the land northward, and did preach the word of

19
00:02:06,951 --> 00:02:11,451
 God unto them, and did prophesy many things unto

20
00:02:11,451 --> 00:02:15,951
 them

21
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:21,868
3 And they did reject all his words, insomuch that

22
00:02:21,868 --> 00:02:28,201
 he could not stay among them, but returned again

23
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:34,534
 unto the land of his nativity

24
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:41,62
4 And seeing the people in a state of such awful

25
00:02:41,62 --> 00:02:48,953
 wickedness, and those Gadianton robbers filling the

26
00:02:48,953 --> 00:02:56,286
 judgment-seats—having usurped the power and

27
00:02:56,286 --> 00:03:03,619
 authority of the land; laying aside the commandments of

28
00:03:03,619 --> 00:03:10,952
 God, and not in the least aright before him;

29
00:03:10,952 --> 00:03:18,285
 doing no justice unto the children of men

30
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:24,631
5 Condemning the righteous because of their

31
00:03:24,631 --> 00:03:30,964
 righteousness; letting the guilty and the wicked go

32
00:03:30,964 --> 00:03:37,297
 unpunished because of their money; and moreover to be

33
00:03:37,297 --> 00:03:43,63
 held in office at the head of government, to rule

34
00:03:43,63 --> 00:03:49,963
 and do according to their wills, that they might

35
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:56,296
 get gain and glory of the world, and, moreover,

36
00:03:56,296 --> 00:04:02,629
 that they might the more easily commit adultery, and

37
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:08,962
 steal, and kill, and do according to their own

38
00:04:08,962 --> 00:04:15,295
 wills

39
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:21,956
6 Now this great iniquity had come upon the

40
00:04:21,956 --> 00:04:27,956
 Nephites, in the space of not many years; and when Nephi

41
00:04:27,956 --> 00:04:33,956
 saw it, his heart was swollen with sorrow within

42
00:04:33,956 --> 00:04:39,956
 his breast; and he did exclaim in the agony of his

43
00:04:39,956 --> 00:04:45,956
 soul

44
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:52,238
7 Oh, that I could have had my days in the days

45
00:04:52,238 --> 00:04:58,524
 when my father Nephi first came out of the land of

46
00:04:58,524 --> 00:05:04,81
 Jerusalem, that I could have joyed with him in the

47
00:05:04,81 --> 00:05:11,096
 promised land; then were his people easy to be

48
00:05:11,096 --> 00:05:17,382
 entreated, firm to keep the commandments of God, and

49
00:05:17,382 --> 00:05:23,668
 slow to be led to do iniquity; and they were quick

50
00:05:23,668 --> 00:05:29,954
 to hearken unto the words of the Lord

51
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:34,362
8 Yea, if my days could have been in those days,

52
00:05:34,362 --> 00:05:39,362
 then would my soul have had joy in the

53
00:05:39,362 --> 00:05:44,362
 righteousness of my brethren

54
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:50,944
9 But behold, I am consigned that these are my

55
00:05:50,944 --> 00:05:57,277
 days, and that my soul shall be filled with sorrow

56
00:05:57,277 --> 00:06:03,61
 because of this the wickedness of my brethren

57
00:06:03,33 --> 00:06:21,473
10 And behold, now it came to pass that it was

58
00:06:21,473 --> 00:06:39,616
 upon a tower, which was in the garden of Nephi, which

59
00:06:39,616 --> 00:06:57,759
 was by the highway which led to the chief market,

60
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:15,902
 which was in the city of Zarahemla; therefore,

61
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:34,045
 Nephi had bowed himself upon the tower which was in

62
00:07:34,045 --> 00:07:52,188
 his garden, which tower was also near unto the

63
00:07:52,188 --> 00:08:10,331
 garden gate by which led the highway

64
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:12,067
11 And it came to pass that there were certain men

65
00:08:12,067 --> 00:08:13,21
 passing by and saw Nephi as he was pouring out

66
00:08:13,21 --> 00:08:14,353
 his soul unto God upon the tower; and they ran and

67
00:08:14,353 --> 00:08:15,496
 told the people what they had seen, and the people

68
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:16,639
 came together in multitudes that they might know

69
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,782
 the cause of so great mourning for the wickedness

70
00:08:17,782 --> 00:08:18,925
 of the people

71
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:22,898
12 And now, when Nephi arose he beheld the

72
00:08:22,898 --> 00:08:26,898
 multitudes of people who had gathered together

73
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,873
13 And it came to pass that he opened his mouth

74
00:08:28,873 --> 00:08:30,873
 and said unto them: Behold, why have ye gathered

75
00:08:30,873 --> 00:08:32,873
 yourselves together? That I may tell you of your

76
00:08:32,873 --> 00:08:34,873
 iniquities

77
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:35,098
14 Yea, because I have got upon my tower that I

78
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:35,348
 might pour out my soul unto my God, because of the

79
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:35,598
 exceeding sorrow of my heart, which is because of

80
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:35,848
 your iniquities

81
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:39,248
15 And because of my mourning and lamentation ye

82
00:08:39,248 --> 00:08:43,248
 have gathered yourselves together, and do marvel;

83
00:08:43,248 --> 00:08:47,248
 yea, and ye have great need to marvel; yea, ye

84
00:08:47,248 --> 00:08:51,248
 ought to marvel because ye are given away that the

85
00:08:51,248 --> 00:08:55,248
 devil has got so great hold upon your hearts

86
00:08:55,668 --> 00:09:01,668
16 Yea, how could you have given way to the

87
00:09:01,668 --> 00:09:07,668
 enticing of him who is seeking to hurl away your souls

88
00:09:07,668 --> 00:09:13,668
 down to everlasting misery and endless wo

89
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:20,953
17 O repent ye, repent ye! Why will ye die? Turn

90
00:09:20,953 --> 00:09:28,62
 ye, turn ye unto the Lord your God. Why has he

91
00:09:28,62 --> 00:09:36,287
 forsaken you

92
00:09:36,242 --> 00:10:23,992
18 It is because you have hardened your hearts;

93
00:10:23,992 --> 00:11:11,742
 yea, ye will not hearken unto the voice of the good

94
00:11:11,742 --> 00:11:59,492
 shepherd; yea, ye have provoked him to anger

95
00:11:59,492 --> 00:12:47,242
 against you

96
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:49,634
19 And behold, instead of gathering you, except ye

97
00:12:49,634 --> 00:12:51,634
 will repent, behold, he shall scatter you forth

98
00:12:51,634 --> 00:12:53,634
 that ye shall become meat for dogs and wild beasts

99
00:12:53,634 --> 00:12:55,634


100
00:12:55,608 --> 00:13:03,608
20 O, how could you have forgotten your God in the

101
00:13:03,608 --> 00:13:11,608
 very day that he has delivered you

102
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:12,7
21 But behold, it is to get gain, to be praised of

103
00:13:12,7 --> 00:13:13,843
 men, yea, and that ye might get gold and silver.

104
00:13:13,843 --> 00:13:14,986
 And ye have set your hearts upon the riches and

105
00:13:14,986 --> 00:13:16,129
 the vain things of this world, for the which ye do

106
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,272
 murder, and plunder, and steal, and bear false

107
00:13:17,272 --> 00:13:18,415
 witness against your neighbor, and do all manner of

108
00:13:18,415 --> 00:13:19,558
 iniquity

109
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:20,532
22 And for this cause wo shall come unto you

110
00:13:20,532 --> 00:13:21,532
 except ye shall repent. For if ye will not repent,

111
00:13:21,532 --> 00:13:22,532
 behold, this great city, and also all those great

112
00:13:22,532 --> 00:13:23,532
 cities which are round about, which are in the land of

113
00:13:23,532 --> 00:13:24,532
 our possession, shall be taken away that ye shall

114
00:13:24,532 --> 00:13:25,532
 have no place in them; for behold, the Lord will

115
00:13:25,532 --> 00:13:26,532
 not grant unto you strength, as he has hitherto

116
00:13:26,532 --> 00:13:27,532
 done, to withstand against your enemies

117
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:28,65
23 For behold, thus saith the Lord: I will not

118
00:13:28,65 --> 00:13:29,793
 show unto the wicked of my strength, to one more than

119
00:13:29,793 --> 00:13:30,936
 the other, save it be unto those who repent of

120
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:32,079
 their sins, and hearken unto my words. Now

121
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,222
 therefore, I would that ye should behold, my brethren, that

122
00:13:33,222 --> 00:13:34,365
 it shall be better for the Lamanites than for you

123
00:13:34,365 --> 00:13:35,508
 except ye shall repent

124
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:35,481
24 For behold, they are more righteous than you,

125
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:35,481
 for they have not sinned against that great

126
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:35,481
 knowledge which ye have received; therefore the Lord will

127
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:35,481
 be merciful unto them; yea, he will lengthen out

128
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:35,481
 their days and increase their seed, even when thou

129
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:35,481
 shalt be utterly destroyed except thou shalt

130
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:35,481
 repent

131
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:39,382
25 Yea, wo be unto you because of that great

132
00:13:39,382 --> 00:13:42,882
 abomination which has come among you; and ye have

133
00:13:42,882 --> 00:13:46,382
 united yourselves unto it, yea, to that secret band

134
00:13:46,382 --> 00:13:49,882
 which was established by Gadianton

135
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:55,912
26 Yea, wo shall come unto you because of that

136
00:13:55,912 --> 00:14:02,662
 pride which ye have suffered to enter your hearts,

137
00:14:02,662 --> 00:14:09,412
 which has lifted you up beyond that which is good

138
00:14:09,412 --> 00:14:16,162
 because of your exceedingly great riches

139
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:21,122
27 Yea, wo be unto you because of your wickedness

140
00:14:21,122 --> 00:14:26,122
 and abominations
