1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:05,455
The Prophecy of Nephi, the Son of Helaman—God

2
00:00:05,455 --> 00:00:10,91
threatens the people of Nephi that he will

3
00:00:10,91 --> 00:00:16,365
visit them in his anger, to their utter

4
00:00:16,365 --> 00:00:21,82
destruction except they repent of their wickedness. God

5
00:00:21,82 --> 00:00:27,275
smiteth the people of Nephi with pestilence;

6
00:00:27,275 --> 00:00:32,73
they repent and turn unto him. Samuel, a

7
00:00:32,73 --> 00:00:38,185
Lamanite, prophesies unto the Nephites. Comprising

8
00:00:38,185 --> 00:00:43,64
chapters 7 through 16.Chapter 7 Nephi is

9
00:00:43,64 --> 00:00:49,095
rejected in the north and returns to Zarahemla—He

10
00:00:49,095 --> 00:00:54,55
prays upon his garden tower and then calls upon

11
00:00:54,55 --> 00:01:00,227
the people to repent or perish. About 23–21 B.C. 

12
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:00,027
1 Behold, now it came to pass in the

13
00:01:00,027 --> 00:00:59,827
sixty and ninth year of the reign of the

14
00:00:59,827 --> 00:00:59,627
judges over the people of the Nephites, that

15
00:00:59,627 --> 00:00:59,427
Nephi, the son of Helaman, returned to

16
00:00:59,427 --> 00:00:59,293
the land of Zarahemla from the land northward.

17
00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:00,293
2 For he had been forth among the

18
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:01,293
people who were in the land northward, and

19
00:01:01,293 --> 00:01:02,293
did preach the word of God unto them,

20
00:01:02,293 --> 00:01:03,697
and did prophesy many things unto them;

21
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:04,447
3 And they did reject all his

22
00:01:04,447 --> 00:01:05,197
words, insomuch that he could not

23
00:01:05,197 --> 00:01:05,947
stay among them, but returned

24
00:01:05,947 --> 00:01:06,099
again unto the land of his nativity.

25
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:06,877
4 And seeing the people in a

26
00:01:06,877 --> 00:01:07,655
state of such awful wickedness, and

27
00:01:07,655 --> 00:01:08,433
those Gadianton robbers filling

28
00:01:08,433 --> 00:01:09,211
the judgment-seats—having

29
00:01:09,211 --> 00:01:09,989
usurped the power and authority of

30
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:10,767
the land; laying aside the

31
00:01:10,767 --> 00:01:11,545
commandments of God, and not in the

32
00:01:11,545 --> 00:01:12,323
least aright before him; doing no

33
00:01:12,323 --> 00:01:13,607
justice unto the children of men;

34
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:14,915
5 Condemning the righteous

35
00:01:14,915 --> 00:01:16,223
because of their righteousness;

36
00:01:16,223 --> 00:01:17,531
letting the guilty and the wicked

37
00:01:17,531 --> 00:01:18,839
go unpunished because of their

38
00:01:18,839 --> 00:01:20,147
money; and moreover to be held

39
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:21,455
in office at the head of

40
00:01:21,455 --> 00:01:22,763
government, to rule and do according

41
00:01:22,763 --> 00:01:24,071
to their wills, that they might

42
00:01:24,071 --> 00:01:25,379
get gain and glory of the

43
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:26,687
world, and, moreover, that they

44
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:27,995
might the more easily commit

45
00:01:27,995 --> 00:01:29,303
adultery, and steal, and kill, and

46
00:01:29,303 --> 00:01:30,023
do according to their own wills—

47
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:30,309
6 Now this great iniquity had

48
00:01:30,309 --> 00:01:30,595
come upon the Nephites, in

49
00:01:30,595 --> 00:01:30,881
the space of not many years;

50
00:01:30,881 --> 00:01:31,167
and when Nephi saw it, his

51
00:01:31,167 --> 00:01:31,453
heart was swollen with sorrow

52
00:01:31,453 --> 00:01:31,739
within his breast; and he did

53
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:32,426
exclaim in the agony of his soul:

54
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:33,926
7 Oh, that I could have had

55
00:01:33,926 --> 00:01:35,426
my days in the days when my

56
00:01:35,426 --> 00:01:36,926
father Nephi first came out

57
00:01:36,926 --> 00:01:38,426
of the land of Jerusalem,

58
00:01:38,426 --> 00:01:39,926
that I could have joyed with

59
00:01:39,926 --> 00:01:41,426
him in the promised land;

60
00:01:41,426 --> 00:01:42,926
then were his people easy to be

61
00:01:42,926 --> 00:01:44,426
entreated, firm to keep the

62
00:01:44,426 --> 00:01:45,926
commandments of God, and

63
00:01:45,926 --> 00:01:47,426
slow to be led to do iniquity;

64
00:01:47,426 --> 00:01:48,926
and they were quick to

65
00:01:48,926 --> 00:01:50,744
hearken unto the words of the Lord—

66
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:52,144
8 Yea, if my days could

67
00:01:52,144 --> 00:01:53,544
have been in those

68
00:01:53,544 --> 00:01:54,944
days, then would my soul

69
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,344
have had joy in the

70
00:01:56,344 --> 00:01:57,784
righteousness of my brethren.

71
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,07
9 But behold, I am

72
00:02:00,07 --> 00:02:02,356
consigned that these

73
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:04,642
are my days, and

74
00:02:04,642 --> 00:02:06,928
that my soul shall be

75
00:02:06,928 --> 00:02:09,214
filled with sorrow

76
00:02:09,214 --> 00:02:11,5
because of this the

77
00:02:11,5 --> 00:02:13,734
wickedness of my brethren.

78
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:14,616
10 And behold, now

79
00:02:14,616 --> 00:02:15,498
it came to pass

80
00:02:15,498 --> 00:02:16,38
that it was upon a

81
00:02:16,38 --> 00:02:17,262
tower, which was in

82
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,144
the garden of Nephi,

83
00:02:18,144 --> 00:02:19,026
which was by the

84
00:02:19,026 --> 00:02:19,908
highway which led to

85
00:02:19,908 --> 00:02:20,79
the chief market,

86
00:02:20,79 --> 00:02:21,672
which was in the

87
00:02:21,672 --> 00:02:22,554
city of Zarahemla;

88
00:02:22,554 --> 00:02:23,436
therefore, Nephi had

89
00:02:23,436 --> 00:02:24,318
bowed himself upon

90
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:25,2
the tower which was

91
00:02:25,2 --> 00:02:26,082
in his garden,

92
00:02:26,082 --> 00:02:26,964
which tower was also

93
00:02:26,964 --> 00:02:27,846
near unto the garden

94
00:02:27,846 --> 00:02:28,015
gate by which led the highway.

95
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:28,25
11 And it came to

96
00:02:28,25 --> 00:02:28,485
pass that there

97
00:02:28,485 --> 00:02:28,72
were certain men

98
00:02:28,72 --> 00:02:28,955
passing by and saw

99
00:02:28,955 --> 00:02:29,19
Nephi as he was

100
00:02:29,19 --> 00:02:29,425
pouring out his soul

101
00:02:29,425 --> 00:02:29,66
unto God upon the

102
00:02:29,66 --> 00:02:29,895
tower; and they ran

103
00:02:29,895 --> 00:02:30,13
and told the

104
00:02:30,13 --> 00:02:30,365
people what they had

105
00:02:30,365 --> 00:02:30,6
seen, and the

106
00:02:30,6 --> 00:02:30,835
people came together in

107
00:02:30,835 --> 00:02:31,07
multitudes that

108
00:02:31,07 --> 00:02:31,305
they might know the

109
00:02:31,305 --> 00:02:31,54
cause of so great

110
00:02:31,54 --> 00:02:31,775
mourning for the

111
00:02:31,775 --> 00:02:32,419
wickedness of the people.

112
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:38,419
12 And now, when

113
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:44,419
Nephi arose he

114
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:50,419
beheld the multitudes

115
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:56,419
of people who had

116
00:02:56,419 --> 00:03:02,649
gathered together.

117
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:03,76
13 And it came to

118
00:03:03,76 --> 00:03:04,871
pass that he

119
00:03:04,871 --> 00:03:05,982
opened his mouth and

120
00:03:05,982 --> 00:03:07,093
said unto them:

121
00:03:07,093 --> 00:03:08,204
Behold, why have

122
00:03:08,204 --> 00:03:09,315
ye gathered

123
00:03:09,315 --> 00:03:10,426
yourselves together?

124
00:03:10,426 --> 00:03:11,537
That I may tell

125
00:03:11,537 --> 00:03:12,993
you of your iniquities?

126
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:13,493
14 Yea, because

127
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:13,993
I have got upon

128
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:14,493
my tower that I

129
00:03:14,493 --> 00:03:14,993
might pour out

130
00:03:14,993 --> 00:03:15,493
my soul unto my

131
00:03:15,493 --> 00:03:15,993
God, because of

132
00:03:15,993 --> 00:03:16,493
the exceeding

133
00:03:16,493 --> 00:03:16,993
sorrow of my heart,

134
00:03:16,993 --> 00:03:17,493
which is

135
00:03:17,493 --> 00:03:17,397
because of your iniquities!

136
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:17,897
15 And because

137
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:18,397
of my mourning

138
00:03:18,397 --> 00:03:18,897
and lamentation

139
00:03:18,897 --> 00:03:19,397
ye have

140
00:03:19,397 --> 00:03:19,897
gathered yourselves

141
00:03:19,897 --> 00:03:20,397
together, and do

142
00:03:20,397 --> 00:03:20,897
marvel; yea,

143
00:03:20,897 --> 00:03:21,397
and ye have

144
00:03:21,397 --> 00:03:21,897
great need to

145
00:03:21,897 --> 00:03:22,397
marvel; yea, ye

146
00:03:22,397 --> 00:03:22,897
ought to marvel

147
00:03:22,897 --> 00:03:23,397
because ye are

148
00:03:23,397 --> 00:03:23,897
given away that

149
00:03:23,897 --> 00:03:24,397
the devil has got

150
00:03:24,397 --> 00:03:24,897
so great hold

151
00:03:24,897 --> 00:03:25,839
upon your hearts.

152
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:29,339
16 Yea, how

153
00:03:29,339 --> 00:03:32,839
could you have

154
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:36,339
given way to

155
00:03:36,339 --> 00:03:39,839
the enticing of

156
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:43,339
him who is

157
00:03:43,339 --> 00:03:46,839
seeking to hurl

158
00:03:46,839 --> 00:03:50,339
away your souls

159
00:03:50,339 --> 00:03:53,839
down to

160
00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:57,339
everlasting misery

161
00:03:57,339 --> 00:04:00,107
and endless wo?

162
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:01,982
17 O repent

163
00:04:01,982 --> 00:04:03,857
ye, repent ye!

164
00:04:03,857 --> 00:04:05,732
Why will ye

165
00:04:05,732 --> 00:04:07,607
die? Turn ye,

166
00:04:07,607 --> 00:04:09,482
turn ye unto

167
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:11,357
the Lord

168
00:04:11,357 --> 00:04:13,232
your God. Why

169
00:04:13,232 --> 00:04:15,589
has he forsaken you?

170
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:16,666
18 It is

171
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:17,743
because you

172
00:04:17,743 --> 00:04:18,82
have hardened

173
00:04:18,82 --> 00:04:19,897
your hearts;

174
00:04:19,897 --> 00:04:20,974
yea, ye will

175
00:04:20,974 --> 00:04:22,051
not hearken

176
00:04:22,051 --> 00:04:23,128
unto the

177
00:04:23,128 --> 00:04:24,205
voice of the

178
00:04:24,205 --> 00:04:25,282
good

179
00:04:25,282 --> 00:04:26,359
shepherd; yea, ye

180
00:04:26,359 --> 00:04:27,436
have provoked

181
00:04:27,436 --> 00:04:28,513
him to anger

182
00:04:28,513 --> 00:04:29,436
against you.

183
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,59
19 And

184
00:04:30,59 --> 00:04:31,744
behold, instead

185
00:04:31,744 --> 00:04:32,898
of

186
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:34,052
gathering you,

187
00:04:34,052 --> 00:04:35,206
except ye will

188
00:04:35,206 --> 00:04:36,36
repent,

189
00:04:36,36 --> 00:04:37,514
behold, he

190
00:04:37,514 --> 00:04:38,668
shall scatter

191
00:04:38,668 --> 00:04:39,822
you forth

192
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:40,976
that ye

193
00:04:40,976 --> 00:04:42,13
shall become

194
00:04:42,13 --> 00:04:43,284
meat for

195
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:44,918
dogs and wild beasts.

196
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:49,793
20 O, how

197
00:04:49,793 --> 00:04:54,668
could you

198
00:04:54,668 --> 00:04:59,543

00:04:59,543 --> 00:05:04,418
forgotten your

200
00:05:04,418 --> 00:05:09,293
God in the

201
00:05:09,293 --> 00:05:14,168
very day

202
00:05:14,168 --> 00:05:19,043

203
00:05:19,043 --> 00:05:23,123
has delivered you?

204
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:23,284
21 But

205
00:05:23,284 --> 00:05:23,445
behold, it

206
00:05:23,445 --> 00:05:23,606

And ye

shall have

267
00:05:39,44 --> 00:05:39,781

00:05:40,463 --> 00:05:40,804
behold,

271
00:05:40,804 --> 00:05:41,145
the Lord

272
00:05:41,145 --> 00:05:41,486
will not

273
00:05:41,486 --> 00:05:41,827
grant

274
00:05:41,827 --> 00:05:42,168
unto you

275
00:05:42,168 --> 00:05:42,509
strength,

276
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:42,85
as he

00:05:43,191 --> 00:05:43,543
hitherto done, to withstand against your enemies.

279

behold,

281
00:05:44,421 --> 00:05:44,86
thus

282
00:05:44,86 --> 00:05:45,299
saith

283
00:05:45,299 --> 00:05:45,738
the Lord:

284
00:05:45,738 --> 00:05:46,177
I will

285
00:05:46,177 --> 00:05:46,616

288
00:05:47,494 --> 00:05:47,933
wicked of

289
00:05:47,933 --> 00:05:48,372
my

290
00:05:48,372 --> 00:05:48,811
strength,

291
00:05:48,811 --> 00:05:49,25
to one

292
00:05:49,25 --> 00:05:49,689
more

293
00:05:49,689 --> 00:05:50,128
than the

294
00:05:50,128 --> 00:05:50,567
other,

295
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:51,006
save it

296
00:05:51,006 --> 00:05:51,445
be

297
00:05:51,445 --> 00:05:51,884
unto those

298
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:52,323
who

299
00:05:52,323 --> 00:05:52,762
repent of

300
00:05:52,762 --> 00:05:53,201
their

301
00:05:53,201 --> 00:05:53,64
sins,

302
00:05:53,64 --> 00:05:54,079
and

303
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:54,518
hearken

304
00:05:54,518 --> 00:05:54,957
unto my

305
00:05:54,957 --> 00:05:55,396
words.

306
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:55,835
Now

307
00:05:55,835 --> 00:05:56,274
therefore, I

308
00:05:56,274 --> 00:05:56,713
would

309
00:05:56,713 --> 00:05:57,152
that ye

310
00:05:57,152 --> 00:05:57,591

it shall

316
00:05:59,786 --> 00:06:00,225
be

317
00:06:00,225 --> 00:06:00,664
better for

318
00:06:00,664 --> 00:06:01,103
the

319
00:06:01,103 --> 00:06:01,895
Lamanites than for you except ye shall repent.
