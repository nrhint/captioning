00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:09,333
Chapter 6 The righteous Lamanites preach to the

2
00:00:09,333 --> 00:00:18,666
 wicked Nephites—Both peoples prosper during an era

3
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:27,999
 of peace and plenty—Lucifer, the author of sin,

4
00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:37,332
 stirs up the hearts of the wicked and the Gadianton

5
00:00:37,332 --> 00:00:46,665
 robbers in murder and wickedness—The robbers take

6
00:00:46,665 --> 00:00:55,998
 over the Nephite government. About 29–23 B.C.

7
00:00:56,69 --> 00:01:02,119
1 And it came to pass that when the sixty and

8
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:07,548
 second year of the reign of the judges had ended, all

9
00:01:07,548 --> 00:01:12,977
 these things had happened and the Lamanites had

10
00:01:12,977 --> 00:01:18,406
 become, the more part of them, a righteous people,

11
00:01:18,406 --> 00:01:23,835
 insomuch that their righteousness did exceed that

12
00:01:23,835 --> 00:01:29,264
 of the Nephites, because of their firmness and

13
00:01:29,264 --> 00:01:34,693
 their steadiness in the faith

14
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:41,595
2 For behold, there were many of the Nephites who

15
00:01:41,595 --> 00:01:48,595
 had become hardened and impenitent and grossly

16
00:01:48,595 --> 00:01:55,595
 wicked, insomuch that they did reject the word of God

17
00:01:55,595 --> 00:02:02,595
 and all the preaching and prophesying which did

18
00:02:02,595 --> 00:02:09,595
 come among them

19
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:12,396
3 Nevertheless, the people of the church did have

20
00:02:12,396 --> 00:02:15,229
 great joy because of the conversion of the

21
00:02:15,229 --> 00:02:18,062
 Lamanites, yea, because of the church of God, which had

22
00:02:18,062 --> 00:02:20,895
 been established among them. And they did

23
00:02:20,895 --> 00:02:23,728
 fellowship one with another, and did rejoice one with

24
00:02:23,728 --> 00:02:26,561
 another, and did have great joy

25
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:42,647
4 And it came to pass that many of the Lamanites

26
00:02:42,647 --> 00:02:58,647
 did come down into the land of Zarahemla, and did

27
00:02:58,647 --> 00:03:14,647
 declare unto the people of the Nephites the manner

28
00:03:14,647 --> 00:03:30,647
 of their conversion, and did exhort them to faith

29
00:03:30,647 --> 00:03:46,647
 and repentance

30
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,393
5 Yea, and many did preach with exceedingly great

31
00:03:48,393 --> 00:03:50,393
 power and authority, unto the bringing down many

32
00:03:50,393 --> 00:03:52,393
 of them into the depths of humility, to be the

33
00:03:52,393 --> 00:03:54,393
 humble followers of God and the Lamb

34
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:54,367
6 And it came to pass that many of the Lamanites

35
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:54,367
 did go into the land northward; and also Nephi and

36
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:54,367
 Lehi went into the land northward, to preach unto

37
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:54,367
 the people. And thus ended the sixty and third

38
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:54,367
 year

39
00:03:54,768 --> 00:04:18,768
7 And behold, there was peace in all the land,

40
00:04:18,768 --> 00:04:42,768
 insomuch that the Nephites did go into whatsoever

41
00:04:42,768 --> 00:05:06,768
 part of the land they would, whether among the

42
00:05:06,768 --> 00:05:30,768
 Nephites or the Lamanites

43
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:31,796
8 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did also

44
00:05:31,796 --> 00:05:33,129
 go whithersoever they would, whether it were among

45
00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:34,462
 the Lamanites or among the Nephites; and thus

46
00:05:34,462 --> 00:05:35,795
 they did have free intercourse one with another, to

47
00:05:35,795 --> 00:05:37,128
 buy and to sell, and to get gain, according to

48
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,461
 their desire

49
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:38,438
9 And it came to pass that they became exceedingly

50
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:38,438
 rich, both the Lamanites and the Nephites; and

51
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:38,438
 they did have an exceeding plenty of gold, and of

52
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:38,438
 silver, and of all manner of precious metals, both

53
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:38,438
 in the land south and in the land north

54
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,089
10 Now the land south was called Lehi, and the

55
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,339
 land north was called Mulek, which was after the son

56
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:42,589
 of Zedekiah; for the Lord did bring Mulek into the

57
00:05:42,589 --> 00:05:43,839
 land north, and Lehi into the land south

58
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:50,576
11 And behold, there was all manner of gold in

59
00:05:50,576 --> 00:05:57,976
 both these lands, and of silver, and of precious ore

60
00:05:57,976 --> 00:06:05,376
 of every kind; and there were also curious

61
00:06:05,376 --> 00:06:12,776
 workmen, who did work all kinds of ore and did refine it;

62
00:06:12,776 --> 00:06:20,176
 and thus they did become rich

63
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:26,18
12 They did raise grain in abundance, both in the

64
00:06:26,18 --> 00:06:32,013
 north and in the south; and they did flourish

65
00:06:32,013 --> 00:06:37,846
 exceedingly, both in the north and in the south. And

66
00:06:37,846 --> 00:06:43,679
 they did multiply and wax exceedingly strong in the

67
00:06:43,679 --> 00:06:49,512
 land. And they did raise many flocks and herds,

68
00:06:49,512 --> 00:06:55,345
 yea, many fatlings

69
00:06:55,548 --> 00:07:01,548
13 Behold their women did toil and spin, and did

70
00:07:01,548 --> 00:07:07,548
 make all manner of cloth, of fine-twined linen and

71
00:07:07,548 --> 00:07:13,548
 cloth of every kind, to clothe their nakedness.

72
00:07:13,548 --> 00:07:19,548
 And thus the sixty and fourth year did pass away in

73
00:07:19,548 --> 00:07:25,548
 peace

74
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:31,261
14 And in the sixty and fifth year they did also

75
00:07:31,261 --> 00:07:37,511
 have great joy and peace, yea, much preaching and

76
00:07:37,511 --> 00:07:43,761
 many prophecies concerning that which was to come.

77
00:07:43,761 --> 00:07:50,011
 And thus passed away the sixty and fifth year

78
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:55,465
15 And it came to pass that in the sixty and sixth

79
00:07:55,465 --> 00:08:00,894
 year of the reign of the judges, behold, Cezoram

80
00:08:00,894 --> 00:08:06,323
 was murdered by an unknown hand as he sat upon the

81
00:08:06,323 --> 00:08:11,752
 judgment-seat. And it came to pass that in the

82
00:08:11,752 --> 00:08:17,181
 same year, that his son, who had been appointed by

83
00:08:17,181 --> 00:08:22,61
 the people in his stead, was also murdered. And

84
00:08:22,61 --> 00:08:28,039
 thus ended the sixty and sixth year

85
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:32,375
16 And in the commencement of the sixty and

86
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:36,042
 seventh year the people began to grow exceedingly wicked

87
00:08:36,042 --> 00:08:39,709
 again

88
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:46,344
17 For behold, the Lord had blessed them so long

89
00:08:46,344 --> 00:08:52,969
 with the riches of the world that they had not been

90
00:08:52,969 --> 00:08:59,594
 stirred up to anger, to wars, nor to bloodshed;

91
00:08:59,594 --> 00:09:06,219
 therefore they began to set their hearts upon their

92
00:09:06,219 --> 00:09:12,844
 riches; yea, they began to seek to get gain that

93
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:19,469
 they might be lifted up one above another;

94
00:09:19,469 --> 00:09:26,094
 therefore they began to commit secret murders, and to rob

95
00:09:26,094 --> 00:09:32,719
 and to plunder, that they might get gain

96
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:39,462
18 And now behold, those murderers and plunderers

97
00:09:39,462 --> 00:09:46,319
 were a band who had been formed by Kishkumen and

98
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:53,176
 Gadianton. And now it had come to pass that there

99
00:09:53,176 --> 00:10:00,033
 were many, even among the Nephites, of Gadianton’s

100
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:06,89
 band. But behold, they were more numerous among

101
00:10:06,89 --> 00:10:13,747
 the more wicked part of the Lamanites. And they were

102
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:20,604
 called Gadianton’s robbers and murderers

103
00:10:20,52 --> 00:10:28,187
19 And it was they who did murder the chief judge

104
00:10:28,187 --> 00:10:35,854
 Cezoram, and his son, while in the judgment-seat;

105
00:10:35,854 --> 00:10:43,521
 and behold, they were not found

106
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:49,177
20 And now it came to pass that when the Lamanites

107
00:10:49,177 --> 00:10:54,377
 found that there were robbers among them they

108
00:10:54,377 --> 00:10:59,577
 were exceedingly sorrowful; and they did use every

109
00:10:59,577 --> 00:11:04,777
 means in their power to destroy them off the face of

110
00:11:04,777 --> 00:11:09,977
 the earth

111
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:14,96
21 But behold, Satan did stir up the hearts of the

112
00:11:14,96 --> 00:11:20,585
 more part of the Nephites, insomuch that they did

113
00:11:20,585 --> 00:11:26,21
 unite with those bands of robbers, and did enter

114
00:11:26,21 --> 00:11:31,835
 into their covenants and their oaths, that they

115
00:11:31,835 --> 00:11:37,46
 would protect and preserve one another in whatsoever

116
00:11:37,46 --> 00:11:43,085
 difficult circumstances they should be placed,

117
00:11:43,085 --> 00:11:48,71
 that they should not suffer for their murders, and

118
00:11:48,71 --> 00:11:54,335
 their plunderings, and their stealings

119
00:11:54,247 --> 00:12:00,533
22 And it came to pass that they did have their

120
00:12:00,533 --> 00:12:06,819
 signs, yea, their secret signs, and their secret

121
00:12:06,819 --> 00:12:13,105
 words; and this that they might distinguish a brother

122
00:12:13,105 --> 00:12:19,391
 who had entered into the covenant, that

123
00:12:19,391 --> 00:12:25,677
 whatsoever wickedness his brother should do he should not

124
00:12:25,677 --> 00:12:31,963
 be injured by his brother, nor by those who did

125
00:12:31,963 --> 00:12:38,249
 belong to his band, who had taken this covenant

126
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:44,491
23 And thus they might murder, and plunder, and

127
00:12:44,491 --> 00:12:50,491
 steal, and commit whoredoms and all manner of

128
00:12:50,491 --> 00:12:56,491
 wickedness, contrary to the laws of their country and

129
00:12:56,491 --> 00:13:02,491
 also the laws of their God

130
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:08,082
24 And whosoever of those who belonged to their

131
00:13:08,082 --> 00:13:13,749
 band should reveal unto the world of their

132
00:13:13,749 --> 00:13:19,416
 wickedness and their abominations, should be tried, not

133
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:25,083
 according to the laws of their country, but according

134
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:30,75
 to the laws of their wickedness, which had been

135
00:13:30,75 --> 00:13:36,417
 given by Gadianton and Kishkumen

136
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:43,166
25 Now behold, it is these secret oaths and

137
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:49,416
 covenants which Alma commanded his son should not go

138
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:55,666
 forth unto the world, lest they should be a means of

139
00:13:55,666 --> 00:14:01,916
 bringing down the people unto destruction

140
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:08,108
26 Now behold, those secret oaths and covenants

141
00:14:08,108 --> 00:14:14,275
 did not come forth unto Gadianton from the records

142
00:14:14,275 --> 00:14:20,442
 which were delivered unto Helaman; but behold, they

143
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:26,609
 were put into the heart of Gadianton by that same

144
00:14:26,609 --> 00:14:32,776
 being who did entice our first parents to partake

145
00:14:32,776 --> 00:14:38,943
 of the forbidden fruit

146
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:44,944
27 Yea, that same being who did plot with Cain,

147
00:14:44,944 --> 00:14:51,444
 that if he would murder his brother Abel it should

148
00:14:51,444 --> 00:14:57,944
 not be known unto the world. And he did plot with

149
00:14:57,944 --> 00:15:04,444
 Cain and his followers from that time forth

150
00:15:04,27 --> 00:15:11,395
28 And also it is that same being who put it into

151
00:15:11,395 --> 00:15:18,52
 the hearts of the people to build a tower

152
00:15:18,52 --> 00:15:25,645
 sufficiently high that they might get to heaven. And it

153
00:15:25,645 --> 00:15:32,77
 was that same being who led on the people who came

154
00:15:32,77 --> 00:15:39,895
 from that tower into this land; who spread the

155
00:15:39,895 --> 00:15:47,02
 works of darkness and abominations over all the face

156
00:15:47,02 --> 00:15:54,145
 of the land, until he dragged the people down to an

157
00:15:54,145 --> 00:16:01,27
 entire destruction, and to an everlasting hell

158
00:16:01,16 --> 00:16:06,36
29 Yea, it is that same being who put it into the

159
00:16:06,36 --> 00:16:11,56
 heart of Gadianton to still carry on the work of

160
00:16:11,56 --> 00:16:16,76
 darkness, and of secret murder; and he has brought

161
00:16:16,76 --> 00:16:21,96
 it forth from the beginning of man even down to

162
00:16:21,96 --> 00:16:27,16
 this time

163
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:33,796
30 And behold, it is he who is the author of all

164
00:16:33,796 --> 00:16:39,939
 sin. And behold, he doth carry on his works of

165
00:16:39,939 --> 00:16:46,082
 darkness and secret murder, and doth hand down their

166
00:16:46,082 --> 00:16:52,225
 plots, and their oaths, and their covenants, and

167
00:16:52,225 --> 00:16:58,368
 their plans of awful wickedness, from generation to

168
00:16:58,368 --> 00:17:04,511
 generation according as he can get hold upon the

169
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:10,654
 hearts of the children of men

170
00:17:10,63 --> 00:17:16,63
31 And now behold, he had got great hold upon the

171
00:17:16,63 --> 00:17:22,63
 hearts of the Nephites; yea, insomuch that they

172
00:17:22,63 --> 00:17:28,63
 had become exceedingly wicked; yea, the more part of

173
00:17:28,63 --> 00:17:34,63
 them had turned out of the way of righteousness,

174
00:17:34,63 --> 00:17:40,63
 and did trample under their feet the commandments

175
00:17:40,63 --> 00:17:46,63
 of God, and did turn unto their own ways, and did

176
00:17:46,63 --> 00:17:52,63
 build up unto themselves idols of their gold and

177
00:17:52,63 --> 00:17:58,63
 their silver

178
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:03,244
32 And it came to pass that all these iniquities

179
00:18:03,244 --> 00:18:08,244
 did come unto them in the space of not many years,

180
00:18:08,244 --> 00:18:13,244
 insomuch that a more part of it had come unto them

181
00:18:13,244 --> 00:18:18,244
 in the sixty and seventh year of the reign of the

182
00:18:18,244 --> 00:18:23,244
 judges over the people of Nephi

183
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:29,069
33 And they did grow in their iniquities in the

184
00:18:29,069 --> 00:18:34,736
 sixty and eighth year also, to the great sorrow and

185
00:18:34,736 --> 00:18:40,403
 lamentation of the righteous

186
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:47,219
34 And thus we see that the Nephites did begin to

187
00:18:47,219 --> 00:18:54,219
 dwindle in unbelief, and grow in wickedness and

188
00:18:54,219 --> 00:19:01,219
 abominations, while the Lamanites began to grow

189
00:19:01,219 --> 00:19:08,219
 exceedingly in the knowledge of their God; yea, they

190
00:19:08,219 --> 00:19:15,219
 did begin to keep his statutes and commandments,

191
00:19:15,219 --> 00:19:22,219
 and to walk in truth and uprightness before him

192
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:27,028
35 And thus we see that the Spirit of the Lord

193
00:19:27,028 --> 00:19:32,028
 began to withdraw from the Nephites, because of the

194
00:19:32,028 --> 00:19:37,028
 wickedness and the hardness of their hearts

195
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:43,343
36 And thus we see that the Lord began to pour out

196
00:19:43,343 --> 00:19:49,343
 his Spirit upon the Lamanites, because of their

197
00:19:49,343 --> 00:19:55,343
 easiness and willingness to believe in his words

198
00:19:55,428 --> 00:20:01,028
37 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did hunt

199
00:20:01,028 --> 00:20:06,628
 the band of robbers of Gadianton; and they did

200
00:20:06,628 --> 00:20:12,228
 preach the word of God among the more wicked part of

201
00:20:12,228 --> 00:20:17,828
 them, insomuch that this band of robbers was

202
00:20:17,828 --> 00:20:23,428
 utterly destroyed from among the Lamanites

203
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:29,989
38 And it came to pass on the other hand, that the

204
00:20:29,989 --> 00:20:35,989
 Nephites did build them up and support them,

205
00:20:35,989 --> 00:20:41,989
 beginning at the more wicked part of them, until they

206
00:20:41,989 --> 00:20:47,989
 had overspread all the land of the Nephites, and

207
00:20:47,989 --> 00:20:53,989
 had seduced the more part of the righteous until

208
00:20:53,989 --> 00:20:59,989
 they had come down to believe in their works and

209
00:20:59,989 --> 00:21:05,989
 partake of their spoils, and to join with them in

210
00:21:05,989 --> 00:21:11,989
 their secret murders and combinations

211
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:17,204
39 And thus they did obtain the sole management of

212
00:21:17,204 --> 00:21:22,804
 the government, insomuch that they did trample

213
00:21:22,804 --> 00:21:28,404
 under their feet and smite and rend and turn their

214
00:21:28,404 --> 00:21:34,004
 backs upon the poor and the meek, and the humble

215
00:21:34,004 --> 00:21:39,604
 followers of God

216
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:46,465
40 And thus we see that they were in an awful

217
00:21:46,465 --> 00:21:52,965
 state, and ripening for an everlasting destruction

218
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:56,511
41 And it came to pass that thus ended the sixty

219
00:21:56,511 --> 00:22:00,511
 and eighth year of the reign of the judges over the

220
00:22:00,511 --> 00:22:04,511
 people of Nephi.
