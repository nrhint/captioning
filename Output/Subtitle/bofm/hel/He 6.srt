00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 6 The righteous Lamanites preach to the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
wicked Nephites—Both peoples prosper during an era

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of peace and plenty—Lucifer, the author of sin,

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
stirs up the hearts of the wicked and the

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Gadianton robbers in murder and wickedness—The robbers

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:06:41,
take over the Nephite government. About 29–23 B.C. 

7
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
1 And it came to pass that when the sixty and

8
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
second year of the reign of the judges had

9
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
ended, all these things had happened and the

10
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
Lamanites had become, the more part of them, a

11
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
righteous people, insomuch that their

12
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
righteousness did exceed that of the Nephites, because of

13
00:06:41,0 --> 00:20:50,
their firmness and their steadiness in the faith.

14
00:20:50,0 --> 00:20:50,0
2 For behold, there were many of the

15
00:20:50,0 --> 00:20:50,0
Nephites who had become hardened and impenitent

16
00:20:50,0 --> 00:20:50,0
and grossly wicked, insomuch that they did

17
00:20:50,0 --> 00:20:50,0
reject the word of God and all the preaching

18
00:20:50,0 --> 00:23:32,
and prophesying which did come among them.

19
00:23:32,0 --> 00:23:32,0
3 Nevertheless, the people of the

20
00:23:32,0 --> 00:23:32,0
church did have great joy because of the

21
00:23:32,0 --> 00:23:32,0
conversion of the Lamanites, yea, because

22
00:23:32,0 --> 00:23:32,0
of the church of God, which had been

23
00:23:32,0 --> 00:23:32,0
established among them. And they did

24
00:23:32,0 --> 00:23:32,0
fellowship one with another, and did

25
00:23:32,0 --> 00:25:44,
rejoice one with another, and did have great joy.

26
00:25:44,0 --> 00:25:44,0
4 And it came to pass that many of

27
00:25:44,0 --> 00:25:44,0
the Lamanites did come down into

28
00:25:44,0 --> 00:25:44,0
the land of Zarahemla, and did

29
00:25:44,0 --> 00:25:44,0
declare unto the people of the Nephites

30
00:25:44,0 --> 00:25:44,0
the manner of their conversion, and

31
00:25:44,0 --> 00:27:56,
did exhort them to faith and repentance.

32
00:27:56,0 --> 00:27:56,0
5 Yea, and many did preach

33
00:27:56,0 --> 00:27:56,0
with exceedingly great power and

34
00:27:56,0 --> 00:27:56,0
authority, unto the bringing

35
00:27:56,0 --> 00:27:56,0
down many of them into the

36
00:27:56,0 --> 00:27:56,0
depths of humility, to be the

37
00:27:56,0 --> 00:46:34,
humble followers of God and the Lamb.

38
00:46:34,0 --> 00:46:34,0
6 And it came to pass that

39
00:46:34,0 --> 00:46:34,0
many of the Lamanites did go

40
00:46:34,0 --> 00:46:34,0
into the land northward; and

41
00:46:34,0 --> 00:46:34,0
also Nephi and Lehi went

42
00:46:34,0 --> 00:46:34,0
into the land northward, to

43
00:46:34,0 --> 00:46:34,0
preach unto the people. And

44
00:46:34,0 --> 00:59:15,
thus ended the sixty and third year.

45
00:59:15,0 --> 00:59:15,0
7 And behold, there was

46
00:59:15,0 --> 00:59:15,0
peace in all the land,

47
00:59:15,0 --> 00:59:15,0
insomuch that the

48
00:59:15,0 --> 00:59:15,0
Nephites did go into whatsoever

49
00:59:15,0 --> 00:59:15,0
part of the land they

50
00:59:15,0 --> 00:59:15,0
would, whether among the

51
00:59:15,0 --> 01:12:24,
Nephites or the Lamanites.

52
01:12:24,0 --> 01:12:24,0
8 And it came to pass

53
01:12:24,0 --> 01:12:24,0
that the Lamanites did

54
01:12:24,0 --> 01:12:24,0
also go whithersoever

55
01:12:24,0 --> 01:12:24,0
they would, whether it

56
01:12:24,0 --> 01:12:24,0
were among the Lamanites

57
01:12:24,0 --> 01:12:24,0
or among the Nephites;

58
01:12:24,0 --> 01:12:24,0
and thus they did have

59
01:12:24,0 --> 01:12:24,0
free intercourse one

60
01:12:24,0 --> 01:12:24,0
with another, to buy and

61
01:12:24,0 --> 01:12:24,0
to sell, and to get

62
01:12:24,0 --> 01:28:34,
gain, according to their desire.

63
01:28:34,0 --> 01:28:34,0
9 And it came to pass

64
01:28:34,0 --> 01:28:34,0
that they became

65
01:28:34,0 --> 01:28:34,0
exceedingly rich, both

66
01:28:34,0 --> 01:28:34,0
the Lamanites and the

67
01:28:34,0 --> 01:28:34,0
Nephites; and they

68
01:28:34,0 --> 01:28:34,0
did have an exceeding

69
01:28:34,0 --> 01:28:34,0
plenty of gold, and of

70
01:28:34,0 --> 01:28:34,0
silver, and of all

71
01:28:34,0 --> 01:28:34,0
manner of precious

72
01:28:34,0 --> 01:28:34,0
metals, both in the land

73
01:28:34,0 --> 01:35:42,
south and in the land north.

74
01:35:42,0 --> 01:35:42,0
10 Now the land

75
01:35:42,0 --> 01:35:42,0
south was called Lehi,

76
01:35:42,0 --> 01:35:42,0
and the land north

77
01:35:42,0 --> 01:35:42,0
was called Mulek,

78
01:35:42,0 --> 01:35:42,0
which was after the

79
01:35:42,0 --> 01:35:42,0
son of Zedekiah;

80
01:35:42,0 --> 01:35:42,0
for the Lord did

81
01:35:42,0 --> 01:35:42,0
bring Mulek into the

82
01:35:42,0 --> 01:35:42,0
land north, and Lehi

83
01:35:42,0 --> 01:39:55,
into the land south.

84
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
11 And behold,

85
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
there was all

86
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
manner of gold in both

87
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
these lands, and

88
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
of silver, and

89
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
of precious ore of

90
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
every kind; and

91
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
there were also

92
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
curious workmen,

93
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
who did work all

94
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
kinds of ore and

95
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
did refine it; and

96
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:41,
thus they did become rich.

97
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
12 They did

98
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
raise grain in

99
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
abundance, both in

100
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
the north and in

101
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
the south; and

102
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
they did flourish

103
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
exceedingly,

104
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
both in the north

105
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
and in the south.

106
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
And they did

107
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
multiply and wax

108
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
exceedingly

109
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
strong in the land.

110
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
And they did

111
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
raise many flocks

112
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:55,
and herds, yea, many fatlings.

113
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
13 Behold their

114
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
women did toil

115
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
and spin, and

116
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
did make all

117
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
manner of cloth,

118
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
of fine-twined

119
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
linen and cloth

120
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
of every kind,

121
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
to clothe

122
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
their nakedness.

123
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
And thus the

124
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
sixty and fourth

125
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:41,
year did pass away in peace.

126
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
14 And in the

127
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
sixty and

128
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
fifth year they

129
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
did also have

130
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
great joy and

131
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
peace, yea, much

132
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
preaching and

133
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
many

134
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
prophecies concerning

135
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
that which was

136
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
to come. And

137
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
thus passed

138
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
away the sixty

139
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:55,
and fifth year.

140
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
15 And it

141
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
came to pass

142
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
that in the

143
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
sixty and sixth

144
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
year of the

145
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
reign of the

146
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
judges, behold,

147
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
Cezoram was

148
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
murdered by

149
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
an unknown

150
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
hand as he sat

151
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
upon the

152
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
judgment-seat. And

153
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
it came to

154
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
pass that in

155
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
the same year,

156
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
that his

157
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
son, who had

158
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
been appointed

159
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
by the people

160
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
in his stead,

161
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
was also

162
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
murdered. And

163
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:41,
thus ended the sixty and sixth year.

164
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
16 And in

165
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
the

166
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
commencement of the

167
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
sixty and

168
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
seventh

169
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
year the

170
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
people began to

171
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
grow

172
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:55,
exceedingly wicked again.

173
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
17 For

174
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
behold, the

175
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
Lord had

176
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
blessed them

177
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
so long

178
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
with the

179
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
riches of

180
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
the world

181
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
that they

182
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
had not been

183
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
stirred

184
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
up to

185
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
anger, to wars,

186
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
nor to

187
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
bloodshed;

188
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
therefore

189
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
they began

190
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
to set

191
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
their hearts

192
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
upon their

193
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
riches;

194
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
yea, they

195
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
began to

196
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
seek to get

197
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
gain that

198
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
they might

199
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
be lifted

200
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
up one

201
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
above

202
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
another;

203
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
therefore they

204
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
began to

205
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
commit secret

206
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
murders,

207
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
and to rob

208
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:41,
and to plunder, that they might get gain.

209
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
18 And

210
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
now behold,

211
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
those

212
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
murderers

213
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
and

214
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
plunderers were

215
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
a band

216
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
who had

217
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
been formed

218
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
by

219
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
Kishkumen and

220
01:39:41,0 --> 01:39:41,0
