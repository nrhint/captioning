00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:29,75
Chapter 15 The Lord chastened the Nephites because

2
00:00:29,75 --> 00:00:59,5
 He loved them—Converted Lamanites are firm and

3
00:00:59,5 --> 00:01:29,25
 steadfast in the faith—The Lord will be merciful

4
00:01:29,25 --> 00:01:59,0
 unto the Lamanites in the latter days. About 6 B.C.

5
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:02,287
1 And now, my beloved brethren, behold, I declare

6
00:02:02,287 --> 00:02:04,954
 unto you that except ye shall repent your houses

7
00:02:04,954 --> 00:02:07,621
 shall be left unto you desolate

8
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:07,594
2 Yea, except ye repent, your women shall have

9
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:07,594
 great cause to mourn in the day that they shall give

10
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:07,594
 suck; for ye shall attempt to flee and there shall

11
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:07,594
 be no place for refuge; yea, and wo unto them

12
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:07,594
 which are with child, for they shall be heavy and

13
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:07,594
 cannot flee; therefore, they shall be trodden down

14
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:07,594
 and shall be left to perish

15
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:10,245
3 Yea, wo unto this people who are called the

16
00:02:10,245 --> 00:02:12,495
 people of Nephi except they shall repent, when they

17
00:02:12,495 --> 00:02:14,745
 shall see all these signs and wonders which shall be

18
00:02:14,745 --> 00:02:16,995
 showed unto them; for behold, they have been a

19
00:02:16,995 --> 00:02:19,245
 chosen people of the Lord; yea, the people of Nephi

20
00:02:19,245 --> 00:02:21,495
 hath he loved, and also hath he chastened them;

21
00:02:21,495 --> 00:02:23,745
 yea, in the days of their iniquities hath he

22
00:02:23,745 --> 00:02:25,995
 chastened them because he loveth them

23
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:30,188
4 But behold my brethren, the Lamanites hath he

24
00:02:30,188 --> 00:02:35,331
 hated because their deeds have been evil

25
00:02:35,331 --> 00:02:40,474
 continually, and this because of the iniquity of the

26
00:02:40,474 --> 00:02:45,617
 tradition of their fathers. But behold, salvation hath

27
00:02:45,617 --> 00:02:50,76
 come unto them through the preaching of the Nephites;

28
00:02:50,76 --> 00:02:55,903
 and for this intent hath the Lord prolonged their

29
00:02:55,903 --> 00:03:01,046
 days

30
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:23,481
5 And I would that ye should behold that the more

31
00:03:23,481 --> 00:03:45,681
 part of them are in the path of their duty, and

32
00:03:45,681 --> 00:04:07,881
 they do walk circumspectly before God, and they do

33
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:30,081
 observe to keep his commandments and his statutes

34
00:04:30,081 --> 00:04:52,281
 and his judgments according to the law of Moses

35
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:55,593
6 Yea, I say unto you, that the more part of them

36
00:04:55,593 --> 00:04:58,26
 are doing this, and they are striving with

37
00:04:58,26 --> 00:05:00,927
 unwearied diligence that they may bring the remainder of

38
00:05:00,927 --> 00:05:03,594
 their brethren to the knowledge of the truth;

39
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:06,261
 therefore there are many who do add to their numbers

40
00:05:06,261 --> 00:05:08,928
 daily

41
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:09,764
7 And behold, ye do know of yourselves, for ye

42
00:05:09,764 --> 00:05:10,653
 have witnessed it, that as many of them as are

43
00:05:10,653 --> 00:05:11,542
 brought to the knowledge of the truth, and to know of

44
00:05:11,542 --> 00:05:12,431
 the wicked and abominable traditions of their

45
00:05:12,431 --> 00:05:13,32
 fathers, and are led to believe the holy scriptures,

46
00:05:13,32 --> 00:05:14,209
 yea, the prophecies of the holy prophets, which are

47
00:05:14,209 --> 00:05:15,098
 written, which leadeth them to faith on the Lord,

48
00:05:15,098 --> 00:05:15,987
 and unto repentance, which faith and repentance

49
00:05:15,987 --> 00:05:16,876
 bringeth a change of heart unto them

50
00:05:16,85 --> 00:05:17,1
8 Therefore, as many as have come to this, ye know

51
00:05:17,1 --> 00:05:17,35
 of yourselves are firm and steadfast in the

52
00:05:17,35 --> 00:05:17,6
 faith, and in the thing wherewith they have been made

53
00:05:17,6 --> 00:05:17,85
 free

54
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:50,517
9 And ye know also that they have buried their

55
00:05:50,517 --> 00:06:23,517
 weapons of war, and they fear to take them up lest by

56
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:56,517
 any means they should sin; yea, ye can see that

57
00:06:56,517 --> 00:07:29,517
 they fear to sin—for behold they will suffer

58
00:07:29,517 --> 00:08:02,517
 themselves that they be trodden down and slain by their

59
00:08:02,517 --> 00:08:35,517
 enemies, and will not lift their swords against

60
00:08:35,517 --> 00:09:08,517
 them, and this because of their faith in Christ

61
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:10,115
10 And now, because of their steadfastness when

62
00:09:10,115 --> 00:09:11,448
 they do believe in that thing which they do believe,

63
00:09:11,448 --> 00:09:12,781
 for because of their firmness when they are once

64
00:09:12,781 --> 00:09:14,114
 enlightened, behold, the Lord shall bless them and

65
00:09:14,114 --> 00:09:15,447
 prolong their days, notwithstanding their

66
00:09:15,447 --> 00:09:16,78
 iniquity

67
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:17,899
11 Yea, even if they should dwindle in unbelief

68
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:19,042
 the Lord shall prolong their days, until the time

69
00:09:19,042 --> 00:09:20,185
 shall come which hath been spoken of by our fathers,

70
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:21,328
 and also by the prophet Zenos, and many other

71
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:22,471
 prophets, concerning the restoration of our brethren,

72
00:09:22,471 --> 00:09:23,614
 the Lamanites, again to the knowledge of the

73
00:09:23,614 --> 00:09:24,757
 truth

74
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:03,62
14 Therefore I say unto you, it shall be better

75
00:02:03,62 --> 00:02:07,62
 for them than for you except ye repent

76
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:10,261
15 For behold, had the mighty works been shown

77
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:12,928
 unto them which have been shown unto you, yea, unto

78
00:02:12,928 --> 00:02:15,595
 them who have dwindled in unbelief because of the

79
00:02:15,595 --> 00:02:18,262
 traditions of their fathers, ye can see of

80
00:02:18,262 --> 00:02:20,929
 yourselves that they never would again have dwindled in

81
00:02:20,929 --> 00:02:23,596
 unbelief

82
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:27,543
16 Therefore, saith the Lord: I will not utterly

83
00:02:27,543 --> 00:02:31,543
 destroy them, but I will cause that in the day of

84
00:02:31,543 --> 00:02:35,543
 my wisdom they shall return again unto me, saith

85
00:02:35,543 --> 00:02:39,543
 the Lord

86
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:39,493
17 And now behold, saith the Lord, concerning the

87
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:39,493
 people of the Nephites: If they will not repent,

88
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:39,493
 and observe to do my will, I will utterly destroy

89
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:39,493
 them, saith the Lord, because of their unbelief

90
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:39,493
 notwithstanding the many mighty works which I have

91
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:39,493
 done among them; and as surely as the Lord liveth

92
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:39,493
 shall these things be, saith the Lord.
