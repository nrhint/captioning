00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 15 The Lord chastened the Nephites

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
because He loved them—Converted Lamanites are firm and

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
steadfast in the faith—The Lord will be merciful

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:03:31,
unto the Lamanites in the latter days. About 6 B.C. 

5
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
1 And now, my beloved brethren, behold, I

6
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
declare unto you that except ye shall repent

7
00:03:31,0 --> 00:08:14,
your houses shall be left unto you desolate.

8
00:08:14,0 --> 00:08:14,0
2 Yea, except ye repent, your women

9
00:08:14,0 --> 00:08:14,0
shall have great cause to mourn in the day

10
00:08:14,0 --> 00:08:14,0
that they shall give suck; for ye shall

11
00:08:14,0 --> 00:08:14,0
attempt to flee and there shall be no

12
00:08:14,0 --> 00:08:14,0
place for refuge; yea, and wo unto them

13
00:08:14,0 --> 00:08:14,0
which are with child, for they shall be

14
00:08:14,0 --> 00:08:14,0
heavy and cannot flee; therefore, they

15
00:08:14,0 --> 00:07:46,
shall be trodden down and shall be left to perish.

16
00:07:46,0 --> 00:07:46,0
3 Yea, wo unto this people who are

17
00:07:46,0 --> 00:07:46,0
called the people of Nephi except they

18
00:07:46,0 --> 00:07:46,0
shall repent, when they shall see all

19
00:07:46,0 --> 00:07:46,0
these signs and wonders which shall be

20
00:07:46,0 --> 00:07:46,0
showed unto them; for behold, they have

21
00:07:46,0 --> 00:07:46,0
been a chosen people of the Lord;

22
00:07:46,0 --> 00:07:46,0
yea, the people of Nephi hath he loved,

23
00:07:46,0 --> 00:07:46,0
and also hath he chastened them; yea,

24
00:07:46,0 --> 00:07:46,0
in the days of their iniquities hath he

25
00:07:46,0 --> 00:07:18,
chastened them because he loveth them.

26
00:07:18,0 --> 00:07:18,0
4 But behold my brethren, the

27
00:07:18,0 --> 00:07:18,0
Lamanites hath he hated because their

28
00:07:18,0 --> 00:07:18,0
deeds have been evil continually,

29
00:07:18,0 --> 00:07:18,0
and this because of the iniquity

30
00:07:18,0 --> 00:07:18,0
of the tradition of their fathers.

31
00:07:18,0 --> 00:07:18,0
But behold, salvation hath come

32
00:07:18,0 --> 00:07:18,0
unto them through the preaching of

33
00:07:18,0 --> 00:07:18,0
the Nephites; and for this intent

34
00:07:18,0 --> 00:06:50,
hath the Lord prolonged their days.

35
00:06:50,0 --> 00:06:50,0
5 And I would that ye should

36
00:06:50,0 --> 00:06:50,0
behold that the more part of

37
00:06:50,0 --> 00:06:50,0
them are in the path of their

38
00:06:50,0 --> 00:06:50,0
duty, and they do walk

39
00:06:50,0 --> 00:06:50,0
circumspectly before God, and they do

40
00:06:50,0 --> 00:06:50,0
observe to keep his

41
00:06:50,0 --> 00:06:50,0
commandments and his statutes and his

42
00:06:50,0 --> 00:06:36,
judgments according to the law of Moses.

43
00:06:36,0 --> 00:06:36,0
6 Yea, I say unto you, that

44
00:06:36,0 --> 00:06:36,0
the more part of them are

45
00:06:36,0 --> 00:06:36,0
doing this, and they are

46
00:06:36,0 --> 00:06:36,0
striving with unwearied diligence

47
00:06:36,0 --> 00:06:36,0
that they may bring the

48
00:06:36,0 --> 00:06:36,0
remainder of their brethren to

49
00:06:36,0 --> 00:06:36,0
the knowledge of the truth;

50
00:06:36,0 --> 00:06:36,0
therefore there are many who

51
00:06:36,0 --> 00:06:22,
do add to their numbers daily.

52
00:06:22,0 --> 00:06:22,0
7 And behold, ye do know of

53
00:06:22,0 --> 00:06:22,0
yourselves, for ye have

54
00:06:22,0 --> 00:06:22,0
witnessed it, that as many of

55
00:06:22,0 --> 00:06:22,0
them as are brought to the

56
00:06:22,0 --> 00:06:22,0
knowledge of the truth,

57
00:06:22,0 --> 00:06:22,0
and to know of the wicked and

58
00:06:22,0 --> 00:06:22,0
abominable traditions of

59
00:06:22,0 --> 00:06:22,0
their fathers, and are led

60
00:06:22,0 --> 00:06:22,0
to believe the holy

61
00:06:22,0 --> 00:06:22,0
scriptures, yea, the prophecies of

62
00:06:22,0 --> 00:06:22,0
the holy prophets, which

63
00:06:22,0 --> 00:06:22,0
are written, which leadeth

64
00:06:22,0 --> 00:06:22,0
them to faith on the Lord,

65
00:06:22,0 --> 00:06:22,0
and unto repentance, which

66
00:06:22,0 --> 00:06:22,0
faith and repentance bringeth

67
00:06:22,0 --> 00:08:06,
a change of heart unto them—

68
00:08:06,0 --> 00:08:06,0
8 Therefore, as many as

69
00:08:06,0 --> 00:08:06,0
have come to this, ye know

70
00:08:06,0 --> 00:08:06,0
of yourselves are firm

71
00:08:06,0 --> 00:08:06,0
and steadfast in the

72
00:08:06,0 --> 00:08:06,0
faith, and in the thing

73
00:08:06,0 --> 00:11:51,
wherewith they have been made free.

74
00:11:51,0 --> 00:11:51,0
9 And ye know also that

75
00:11:51,0 --> 00:11:51,0
they have buried their

76
00:11:51,0 --> 00:11:51,0
weapons of war, and they

77
00:11:51,0 --> 00:11:51,0
fear to take them up

78
00:11:51,0 --> 00:11:51,0
lest by any means they

79
00:11:51,0 --> 00:11:51,0
should sin; yea, ye can see

80
00:11:51,0 --> 00:11:51,0
that they fear to

81
00:11:51,0 --> 00:11:51,0
sin—for behold they will

82
00:11:51,0 --> 00:11:51,0
suffer themselves that they

83
00:11:51,0 --> 00:11:51,0
be trodden down and slain

84
00:11:51,0 --> 00:11:51,0
by their enemies, and

85
00:11:51,0 --> 00:11:51,0
will not lift their

86
00:11:51,0 --> 00:11:51,0
swords against them, and this

87
00:11:51,0 --> 00:11:23,
because of their faith in Christ.

88
00:11:23,0 --> 00:11:23,0
10 And now, because of

89
00:11:23,0 --> 00:11:23,0
their steadfastness

90
00:11:23,0 --> 00:11:23,0
when they do believe in

91
00:11:23,0 --> 00:11:23,0
that thing which they

92
00:11:23,0 --> 00:11:23,0
do believe, for

93
00:11:23,0 --> 00:11:23,0
because of their firmness

94
00:11:23,0 --> 00:11:23,0
when they are once

95
00:11:23,0 --> 00:11:23,0
enlightened, behold, the

96
00:11:23,0 --> 00:11:23,0
Lord shall bless them

97
00:11:23,0 --> 00:11:23,0
and prolong their days,

98
00:11:23,0 --> 00:10:55,
notwithstanding their iniquity—

99
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
11 Yea, even if they

100
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
should dwindle in

101
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
unbelief the Lord shall

102
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
prolong their days,

103
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
until the time shall

104
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
come which hath been

105
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
spoken of by our

106
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
fathers, and also by the

107
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
prophet Zenos, and

108
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
many other prophets,

109
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
concerning the

110
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
restoration of our brethren,

111
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
the Lamanites, again

112
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,
to the knowledge of the truth—

113
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
12 Yea, I say unto

114
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
you, that in the

115
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
latter times the

116
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
promises of the Lord have

117
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
been extended to our

118
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
brethren, the

119
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
Lamanites; and

120
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
notwithstanding the many

121
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
afflictions which they

122
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
shall have, and

123
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
notwithstanding they shall

124
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
be driven to and fro

125
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
upon the face of

126
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
the earth, and be

127
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
hunted, and shall be

128
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
smitten and scattered

129
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
abroad, having no

130
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
place for refuge, the

131
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,
Lord shall be merciful unto them.

132
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
13 And this is

133
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
according to the

134
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
prophecy, that they

135
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
shall again be

136
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
brought to the true

137
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
knowledge, which is

138
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
the knowledge of

139
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
their Redeemer, and

140
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
their great and

141
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
true shepherd, and

142
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,
be numbered among his sheep.

143
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
14 Therefore I

144
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
say unto you, it

145
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
shall be better for

146
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
them than for

147
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,
you except ye repent.

148
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
15 For behold,

149
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
had the mighty

150
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
works been shown

151
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
unto them which

152
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
have been shown

153
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
unto you, yea,

154
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
unto them who have

155
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
dwindled in

156
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
unbelief because of

157
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
the traditions

158
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
of their

159
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
fathers, ye can see of

160
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
yourselves that

161
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
they never would

162
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
again have

163
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,
dwindled in unbelief.

164
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
16 Therefore,

165
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
saith the Lord:

166
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
I will not

167
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
utterly destroy

168
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
them, but I will

169
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
cause that in

170
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
the day of my

171
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
wisdom they shall

172
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
return again

173
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,
unto me, saith the Lord.

174
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
17 And now

175
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
behold, saith the

176
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
Lord,

177
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
concerning the people

178
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
of the

179
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
Nephites: If they

180
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
will not repent,

181
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
and observe

182
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
to do my will,

183
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
I will utterly

184
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
destroy them,

185
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
saith the

186
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
Lord, because of

187
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
their unbelief

188
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0


189
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
notwithstanding the many

190
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
mighty works

191
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
which I have done

192
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
among them;

193
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
and as surely

194
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
as the Lord

195
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,0
liveth shall

196
00:10:55,0 --> 00:10:55,
these things be, saith the Lord.
