00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:07,5
Chapter 15 The Lord chastened the Nephites

2
00:00:07,5 --> 00:00:15,0
because He loved them—Converted Lamanites are firm and

3
00:00:15,0 --> 00:00:22,5
steadfast in the faith—The Lord will be merciful

4
00:00:22,5 --> 00:00:30,23
unto the Lamanites in the latter days. About 6 B.C. 

5
00:00:30,23 --> 00:00:29,897
1 And now, my beloved brethren, behold, I

6
00:00:29,897 --> 00:00:29,564
declare unto you that except ye shall repent

7
00:00:29,564 --> 00:00:29,296
your houses shall be left unto you desolate.

8
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:29,546
2 Yea, except ye repent, your women

9
00:00:29,546 --> 00:00:29,796
shall have great cause to mourn in the day

10
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:30,046
that they shall give suck; for ye shall

11
00:00:30,046 --> 00:00:30,296
attempt to flee and there shall be no

12
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:30,546
place for refuge; yea, and wo unto them

13
00:00:30,546 --> 00:00:30,796
which are with child, for they shall be

14
00:00:30,796 --> 00:00:31,046
heavy and cannot flee; therefore, they

15
00:00:31,046 --> 00:00:31,698
shall be trodden down and shall be left to perish.

16
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:31,598
3 Yea, wo unto this people who are

17
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:31,498
called the people of Nephi except they

18
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:31,398
shall repent, when they shall see all

19
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:31,298
these signs and wonders which shall be

20
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:31,198
showed unto them; for behold, they have

21
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:31,098
been a chosen people of the Lord;

22
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:30,998
yea, the people of Nephi hath he loved,

23
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:30,898
and also hath he chastened them; yea,

24
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:30,798
in the days of their iniquities hath he

25
00:00:30,798 --> 00:00:30,764
chastened them because he loveth them.

26
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:31,32
4 But behold my brethren, the

27
00:00:31,32 --> 00:00:31,876
Lamanites hath he hated because their

28
00:00:31,876 --> 00:00:32,432
deeds have been evil continually,

29
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:32,988
and this because of the iniquity

30
00:00:32,988 --> 00:00:33,544
of the tradition of their fathers.

31
00:00:33,544 --> 00:00:34,1
But behold, salvation hath come

32
00:00:34,1 --> 00:00:34,656
unto them through the preaching of

33
00:00:34,656 --> 00:00:35,212
the Nephites; and for this intent

34
00:00:35,212 --> 00:00:35,168
hath the Lord prolonged their days.

35
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:37,043
5 And I would that ye should

36
00:00:37,043 --> 00:00:38,918
behold that the more part of

37
00:00:38,918 --> 00:00:40,793
them are in the path of their

38
00:00:40,793 --> 00:00:42,668
duty, and they do walk

39
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,543
circumspectly before God, and they do

40
00:00:44,543 --> 00:00:46,418
observe to keep his

41
00:00:46,418 --> 00:00:48,293
commandments and his statutes and his

42
00:00:48,293 --> 00:00:50,651
judgments according to the law of Moses.

43
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:52,207
6 Yea, I say unto you, that

44
00:00:52,207 --> 00:00:53,763
the more part of them are

45
00:00:53,763 --> 00:00:55,319
doing this, and they are

46
00:00:55,319 --> 00:00:56,875
striving with unwearied diligence

47
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:58,431
that they may bring the

48
00:00:58,431 --> 00:00:59,987
remainder of their brethren to

49
00:00:59,987 --> 00:01:01,543
the knowledge of the truth;

50
00:01:01,543 --> 00:01:03,099
therefore there are many who

51
00:01:03,099 --> 00:01:04,932
do add to their numbers daily.

52
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:06,994
7 And behold, ye do know of

53
00:01:06,994 --> 00:01:09,056
yourselves, for ye have

54
00:01:09,056 --> 00:01:11,118
witnessed it, that as many of

55
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:13,18
them as are brought to the

56
00:01:13,18 --> 00:01:15,242
knowledge of the truth,

57
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:17,304
and to know of the wicked and

58
00:01:17,304 --> 00:01:19,366
abominable traditions of

59
00:01:19,366 --> 00:01:21,428
their fathers, and are led

60
00:01:21,428 --> 00:01:23,49
to believe the holy

61
00:01:23,49 --> 00:01:25,552
scriptures, yea, the prophecies of

62
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:27,614
the holy prophets, which

63
00:01:27,614 --> 00:01:29,676
are written, which leadeth

64
00:01:29,676 --> 00:01:31,738
them to faith on the Lord,

65
00:01:31,738 --> 00:01:33,8
and unto repentance, which

66
00:01:33,8 --> 00:01:35,862
faith and repentance bringeth

67
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:37,297
a change of heart unto them—

68
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:43,63
8 Therefore, as many as

69
00:01:43,63 --> 00:01:49,963
have come to this, ye know

70
00:01:49,963 --> 00:01:56,296
of yourselves are firm

71
00:01:56,296 --> 00:02:02,629
and steadfast in the

72
00:02:02,629 --> 00:02:08,962
faith, and in the thing

73
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:15,502
wherewith they have been made free.

74
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:15,931
9 And ye know also that

75
00:02:15,931 --> 00:02:16,36
they have buried their

76
00:02:16,36 --> 00:02:16,789
weapons of war, and they

77
00:02:16,789 --> 00:02:17,218
fear to take them up

78
00:02:17,218 --> 00:02:17,647
lest by any means they

79
00:02:17,647 --> 00:02:18,076
should sin; yea, ye can see

80
00:02:18,076 --> 00:02:18,505
that they fear to

81
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:18,934
sin—for behold they will

82
00:02:18,934 --> 00:02:19,363
suffer themselves that they

83
00:02:19,363 --> 00:02:19,792
be trodden down and slain

84
00:02:19,792 --> 00:02:20,221
by their enemies, and

85
00:02:20,221 --> 00:02:20,65
will not lift their

86
00:02:20,65 --> 00:02:21,079
swords against them, and this

87
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:21,842
because of their faith in Christ.

88
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:25,387
10 And now, because of

89
00:02:25,387 --> 00:02:28,932
their steadfastness

90
00:02:28,932 --> 00:02:32,477
when they do believe in

91
00:02:32,477 --> 00:02:36,022
that thing which they

92
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:39,567
do believe, for

93
00:02:39,567 --> 00:02:43,112
because of their firmness

94
00:02:43,112 --> 00:02:46,657
when they are once

95
00:02:46,657 --> 00:02:50,202
enlightened, behold, the

96
00:02:50,202 --> 00:02:53,747
Lord shall bless them

97
00:02:53,747 --> 00:02:57,292
and prolong their days,

98
00:02:57,292 --> 00:03:00,781
notwithstanding their iniquity—

99
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:01,71
11 Yea, even if they

100
00:03:01,71 --> 00:03:02,639
should dwindle in

101
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:03,568
unbelief the Lord shall

102
00:03:03,568 --> 00:03:04,497
prolong their days,

103
00:03:04,497 --> 00:03:05,426
until the time shall

104
00:03:05,426 --> 00:03:06,355
come which hath been

105
00:03:06,355 --> 00:03:07,284
spoken of by our

106
00:03:07,284 --> 00:03:08,213
fathers, and also by the

107
00:03:08,213 --> 00:03:09,142
prophet Zenos, and

108
00:03:09,142 --> 00:03:10,071
many other prophets,

109
00:03:10,071 --> 00:03:10,0
concerning the

110
00:03:10,0 --> 00:03:11,929
restoration of our brethren,

111
00:03:11,929 --> 00:03:12,858
the Lamanites, again

112
00:03:12,858 --> 00:03:13,16
to the knowledge of the truth—

113
00:03:13,16 --> 00:03:13,792
12 Yea, I say unto

114
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,424
you, that in the

115
00:03:14,424 --> 00:03:15,056
latter times the

116
00:03:15,056 --> 00:03:15,688
promises of the Lord have

117
00:03:15,688 --> 00:03:16,32
been extended to our

118
00:03:16,32 --> 00:03:16,952
brethren, the

119
00:03:16,952 --> 00:03:17,584
Lamanites; and

120
00:03:17,584 --> 00:03:18,216
notwithstanding the many

121
00:03:18,216 --> 00:03:18,848
afflictions which they

122
00:03:18,848 --> 00:03:19,48
shall have, and

123
00:03:19,48 --> 00:03:20,112
notwithstanding they shall

124
00:03:20,112 --> 00:03:20,744
be driven to and fro

125
00:03:20,744 --> 00:03:21,376
upon the face of

126
00:03:21,376 --> 00:03:22,008
the earth, and be

127
00:03:22,008 --> 00:03:22,64
hunted, and shall be

128
00:03:22,64 --> 00:03:23,272
smitten and scattered

129
00:03:23,272 --> 00:03:23,904
abroad, having no

130
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:24,536
place for refuge, the

131
00:03:24,536 --> 00:03:25,539
Lord shall be merciful unto them.

132
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:25,903
13 And this is

133
00:03:25,903 --> 00:03:26,267
according to the

134
00:03:26,267 --> 00:03:26,631
prophecy, that they

135
00:03:26,631 --> 00:03:26,995
shall again be

136
00:03:26,995 --> 00:03:27,359
brought to the true

137
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:27,723
knowledge, which is

138
00:03:27,723 --> 00:03:28,087
the knowledge of

139
00:03:28,087 --> 00:03:28,451
their Redeemer, and

140
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:28,815
their great and

141
00:03:28,815 --> 00:03:29,179
true shepherd, and

142
00:03:29,179 --> 00:03:29,943
be numbered among his sheep.

143
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:35,143
14 Therefore I

144
00:03:35,143 --> 00:03:40,343
say unto you, it

145
00:03:40,343 --> 00:03:45,543
shall be better for

146
00:03:45,543 --> 00:03:50,743
them than for

147
00:03:50,743 --> 00:03:55,302
you except ye repent.

148
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:55,24
15 For behold,

149
00:03:55,24 --> 00:03:55,178
had the mighty

150
00:03:55,178 --> 00:03:55,116
works been shown

151
00:03:55,116 --> 00:03:55,054
unto them which

152
00:03:55,054 --> 00:03:54,992
have been shown

153
00:03:54,992 --> 00:03:54,93
unto you, yea,

154
00:03:54,93 --> 00:03:54,868
unto them who have

155
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:54,806
dwindled in

156
00:03:54,806 --> 00:03:54,744
unbelief because of

157
00:03:54,744 --> 00:03:54,682
the traditions

158
00:03:54,682 --> 00:03:54,62
of their

159
00:03:54,62 --> 00:03:54,558
fathers, ye can see of

160
00:03:54,558 --> 00:03:54,496
yourselves that

161
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:54,434
they never would

162
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:54,372
again have

163
00:03:54,372 --> 00:03:54,835
dwindled in unbelief.

164
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:55,135
16 Therefore,

165
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:55,435
saith the Lord:

166
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:55,735
I will not

167
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:56,035
utterly destroy

168
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:56,335
them, but I will

169
00:03:56,335 --> 00:03:56,635
cause that in

170
00:03:56,635 --> 00:03:56,935
the day of my

171
00:03:56,935 --> 00:03:57,235
wisdom they shall

172
00:03:57,235 --> 00:03:57,535
return again

173
00:03:57,535 --> 00:03:57,237
unto me, saith the Lord.

174
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,324
17 And now

175
00:03:59,324 --> 00:04:01,411
behold, saith the

176
00:04:01,411 --> 00:04:03,498
Lord,

177
00:04:03,498 --> 00:04:05,585
concerning the people

178
00:04:05,585 --> 00:04:07,672
of the

179
00:04:07,672 --> 00:04:09,759
Nephites: If they

180
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,846
will not repent,

181
00:04:11,846 --> 00:04:13,933
and observe

182
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:16,02
to do my will,

183
00:04:16,02 --> 00:04:18,107
I will utterly

184
00:04:18,107 --> 00:04:20,194
destroy them,

185
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:22,281
saith the

186
00:04:22,281 --> 00:04:24,368
Lord, because of

187
00:04:24,368 --> 00:04:26,455
their unbelief

188
00:04:26,455 --> 00:04:28,542


189
00:04:28,542 --> 00:04:30,629
notwithstanding the many

190
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:32,716
mighty works

191
00:04:32,716 --> 00:04:34,803
which I have done

192
00:04:34,803 --> 00:04:36,89
among them;

193
00:04:36,89 --> 00:04:38,977
and as surely

194
00:04:38,977 --> 00:04:41,064
as the Lord

195
00:04:41,064 --> 00:04:43,151
liveth shall

196
00:04:43,151 --> 00:04:45,085
these things be, saith the Lord.
