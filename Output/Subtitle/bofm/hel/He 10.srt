00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:02,6
Chapter 10 The Lord gives Nephi the sealing

2
00:00:02,6 --> 00:00:05,2
power—He is empowered to bind and loose on

3
00:00:05,2 --> 00:00:07,8
earth and in heaven—He commands the people

4
00:00:07,8 --> 00:00:10,4
to repent or perish—The Spirit carries him

5
00:00:10,4 --> 00:00:13,847
from multitude to multitude. About 21–20 B.C. 

6
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,047
1 And it came to pass that there arose

7
00:00:15,047 --> 00:00:16,247
a division among the people, insomuch

8
00:00:16,247 --> 00:00:17,447
that they divided hither and thither and

9
00:00:17,447 --> 00:00:18,647
went their ways, leaving Nephi alone,

10
00:00:18,647 --> 00:00:19,72
as he was standing in the midst of them.

11
00:00:19,72 --> 00:00:21,22
2 And it came to pass that Nephi

12
00:00:21,22 --> 00:00:22,72
went his way towards his own

13
00:00:22,72 --> 00:00:24,22
house, pondering upon the things

14
00:00:24,22 --> 00:00:25,592
which the Lord had shown unto him.

15
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:26,047
3 And it came to pass as he

16
00:00:26,047 --> 00:00:26,502
was thus pondering—being much

17
00:00:26,502 --> 00:00:26,957
cast down because of the

18
00:00:26,957 --> 00:00:27,412
wickedness of the people of the

19
00:00:27,412 --> 00:00:27,867
Nephites, their secret works

20
00:00:27,867 --> 00:00:28,322
of darkness, and their

21
00:00:28,322 --> 00:00:28,777
murderings, and their plunderings,

22
00:00:28,777 --> 00:00:29,232
and all manner of

23
00:00:29,232 --> 00:00:29,687
iniquities—and it came to pass as he was

24
00:00:29,687 --> 00:00:30,142
thus pondering in his heart,

25
00:00:30,142 --> 00:00:30,998
behold, a voice came unto him saying:

26
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:31,453
4 Blessed art thou, Nephi,

27
00:00:31,453 --> 00:00:31,908
for those things which thou

28
00:00:31,908 --> 00:00:32,363
hast done; for I have

29
00:00:32,363 --> 00:00:32,818
beheld how thou hast with

30
00:00:32,818 --> 00:00:33,273
unwearyingness declared the

31
00:00:33,273 --> 00:00:33,728
word, which I have given unto

32
00:00:33,728 --> 00:00:34,183
thee, unto this people. And

33
00:00:34,183 --> 00:00:34,638
thou hast not feared them,

34
00:00:34,638 --> 00:00:35,093
and hast not sought thine

35
00:00:35,093 --> 00:00:35,548
own life, but hast sought my

36
00:00:35,548 --> 00:00:35,402
will, and to keep my commandments.

37
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:35,569
5 And now, because thou

38
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:35,736
hast done this with such

39
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:35,903
unwearyingness, behold, I

40
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:36,07
will bless thee forever;

41
00:00:36,07 --> 00:00:36,237
and I will make thee

42
00:00:36,237 --> 00:00:36,404
mighty in word and in deed,

43
00:00:36,404 --> 00:00:36,571
in faith and in works;

44
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:36,738
yea, even that all things

45
00:00:36,738 --> 00:00:36,905
shall be done unto thee

46
00:00:36,905 --> 00:00:37,072
according to thy word, for

47
00:00:37,072 --> 00:00:37,239
thou shalt not ask that

48
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:37,804
which is contrary to my will.

49
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:38,259
6 Behold, thou art

50
00:00:38,259 --> 00:00:38,714
Nephi, and I am God. Behold,

51
00:00:38,714 --> 00:00:39,169
I declare it unto thee

52
00:00:39,169 --> 00:00:39,624
in the presence of mine

53
00:00:39,624 --> 00:00:40,079
angels, that ye shall

54
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:40,534
have power over this

55
00:00:40,534 --> 00:00:40,989
people, and shall smite the

56
00:00:40,989 --> 00:00:41,444
earth with famine, and

57
00:00:41,444 --> 00:00:41,899
with pestilence, and

58
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:42,354
destruction, according to the

59
00:00:42,354 --> 00:00:42,209
wickedness of this people.

60
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:44,431
7 Behold, I give unto

61
00:00:44,431 --> 00:00:46,653
you power, that

62
00:00:46,653 --> 00:00:48,875
whatsoever ye shall seal on

63
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:51,097
earth shall be sealed in

64
00:00:51,097 --> 00:00:53,319
heaven; and whatsoever

65
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:55,541
ye shall loose on earth

66
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:57,763
shall be loosed in

67
00:00:57,763 --> 00:00:59,985
heaven; and thus shall ye

68
00:00:59,985 --> 00:01:02,529
have power among this people.

69
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:06,029
8 And thus, if ye

70
00:01:06,029 --> 00:01:09,529
shall say unto this temple

71
00:01:09,529 --> 00:01:13,029
it shall be rent in

72
00:01:13,029 --> 00:01:16,843
twain, it shall be done.

73
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:20,243
9 And if ye shall

74
00:01:20,243 --> 00:01:23,643
say unto this

75
00:01:23,643 --> 00:01:27,043
mountain, Be thou cast

76
00:01:27,043 --> 00:01:30,443
down and become

77
00:01:30,443 --> 00:01:33,226
smooth, it shall be done.

78
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:34,626
10 And behold, if

79
00:01:34,626 --> 00:01:36,026
ye shall say

80
00:01:36,026 --> 00:01:37,426
that God shall smite

81
00:01:37,426 --> 00:01:38,826
this people, it

82
00:01:38,826 --> 00:01:40,233
shall come to pass.

83
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:41,4
11 And now

84
00:01:41,4 --> 00:01:42,567
behold, I command

85
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:43,734
you, that ye shall

86
00:01:43,734 --> 00:01:44,901
go and declare

87
00:01:44,901 --> 00:01:46,068
unto this people,

88
00:01:46,068 --> 00:01:47,235
that thus saith

89
00:01:47,235 --> 00:01:48,402
the Lord God,

90
00:01:48,402 --> 00:01:49,569
who is the

91
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:50,736
Almighty: Except ye

92
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:51,903
repent ye shall be

93
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,07
smitten, even

94
00:01:53,07 --> 00:01:54,081
unto destruction.

95
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:55,777
12 And behold,

96
00:01:55,777 --> 00:01:57,473
now it came to

97
00:01:57,473 --> 00:01:59,169
pass that when

98
00:01:59,169 --> 00:02:00,865
the Lord had

99
00:02:00,865 --> 00:02:02,561
spoken these

100
00:02:02,561 --> 00:02:04,257
words unto Nephi,

101
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:05,953
he did stop and

102
00:02:05,953 --> 00:02:07,649
did not go unto

103
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:09,345
his own house,

104
00:02:09,345 --> 00:02:11,041
but did return

105
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:12,737
unto the

106
00:02:12,737 --> 00:02:14,433
multitudes who were

107
00:02:14,433 --> 00:02:16,129
scattered about

108
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:17,825
upon the face

109
00:02:17,825 --> 00:02:19,521
of the land,

110
00:02:19,521 --> 00:02:21,217
and began to

111
00:02:21,217 --> 00:02:22,913
declare unto them

112
00:02:22,913 --> 00:02:24,609
the word of the

113
00:02:24,609 --> 00:02:26,305
Lord which had

114
00:02:26,305 --> 00:02:28,001
been spoken

115
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:29,697
unto him,

116
00:02:29,697 --> 00:02:31,393
concerning their

117
00:02:31,393 --> 00:02:33,02
destruction if they did not repent.

118
00:02:33,02 --> 00:02:35,877
13 Now behold,

119
00:02:35,877 --> 00:02:38,734


120
00:02:38,734 --> 00:02:41,591
notwithstanding that great

121
00:02:41,591 --> 00:02:44,448
miracle which

122
00:02:44,448 --> 00:02:47,305
Nephi had done

123
00:02:47,305 --> 00:02:50,162
in telling

124
00:02:50,162 --> 00:02:53,019
them concerning

125
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:55,876
the death of

126
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:58,733
the chief

127
00:02:58,733 --> 00:03:01,59
judge, they did

128
00:03:01,59 --> 00:03:04,447
harden their

129
00:03:04,447 --> 00:03:07,304
hearts and did not

130
00:03:07,304 --> 00:03:10,161
hearken unto

131
00:03:10,161 --> 00:03:13,36
the words of the Lord.

132
00:03:13,36 --> 00:03:16,633
14 Therefore

133
00:03:16,633 --> 00:03:19,906
Nephi did

134
00:03:19,906 --> 00:03:23,179
declare unto

135
00:03:23,179 --> 00:03:26,452
them the word of

136
00:03:26,452 --> 00:03:29,725
the Lord,

137
00:03:29,725 --> 00:03:32,998
saying: Except

138
00:03:32,998 --> 00:03:36,271
ye repent,

139
00:03:36,271 --> 00:03:39,544
thus saith the

140
00:03:39,544 --> 00:03:42,817
Lord, ye

141
00:03:42,817 --> 00:03:46,09
shall be smitten

142
00:03:46,09 --> 00:03:49,663
even unto destruction.

143
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:49,711
15 And it

144
00:03:49,711 --> 00:03:49,759
came to pass

145
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:49,807
that when

146
00:03:49,807 --> 00:03:49,855
Nephi had

147
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:49,903
declared unto

148
00:03:49,903 --> 00:03:49,951
them the word,

149
00:03:49,951 --> 00:03:49,999
behold, they

150
00:03:49,999 --> 00:03:50,047
did still

151
00:03:50,047 --> 00:03:50,095
harden their

152
00:03:50,095 --> 00:03:50,143
hearts and

153
00:03:50,143 --> 00:03:50,191
would not

154
00:03:50,191 --> 00:03:50,239
hearken unto

155
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:50,287
his words;

156
00:03:50,287 --> 00:03:50,335
therefore they

157
00:03:50,335 --> 00:03:50,383
did revile

158
00:03:50,383 --> 00:03:50,431
against him,

159
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:50,479
and did seek

160
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:50,527
to lay

161
00:03:50,527 --> 00:03:50,575
their hands upon

162
00:03:50,575 --> 00:03:50,623
him that

163
00:03:50,623 --> 00:03:50,13
they might cast him into prison.

164
00:03:50,13 --> 00:03:50,063
16 But

165
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:49,996
behold, the

166
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:49,929
power of God

167
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:49,862
was with

168
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:49,795
him, and they

169
00:03:49,795 --> 00:03:49,728
could not

170
00:03:49,728 --> 00:03:49,661
take him to

171
00:03:49,661 --> 00:03:49,594
cast him

172
00:03:49,594 --> 00:03:49,527
into prison,

173
00:03:49,527 --> 00:03:49,46
for he was

174
00:03:49,46 --> 00:03:49,393
taken by

175
00:03:49,393 --> 00:03:49,326
the Spirit

176
00:03:49,326 --> 00:03:49,259
and conveyed

177
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:49,192
away out of

178
00:03:49,192 --> 00:03:49,663
the midst of them.

179
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:49,716
17 And it

180
00:03:49,716 --> 00:03:49,769
came to

181
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:49,822
pass that

182
00:03:49,822 --> 00:03:49,875
thus he did

183
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:49,928
go forth

184
00:03:49,928 --> 00:03:49,981
in the

185
00:03:49,981 --> 00:03:50,034
Spirit, from

186
00:03:50,034 --> 00:03:50,087
multitude

187
00:03:50,087 --> 00:03:50,14
to

188
00:03:50,14 --> 00:03:50,193
multitude,

189
00:03:50,193 --> 00:03:50,246
declaring the

190
00:03:50,246 --> 00:03:50,299
word of God,

191
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:50,352
even until

192
00:03:50,352 --> 00:03:50,405
he had

193
00:03:50,405 --> 00:03:50,458
declared it

194
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:50,511
unto them

195
00:03:50,511 --> 00:03:50,564
all, or

196
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:50,617
sent it

197
00:03:50,617 --> 00:03:50,13
forth among all the people.

198
00:03:50,13 --> 00:03:50,08
18 And it

199
00:03:50,08 --> 00:03:50,03
came to

200
00:03:50,03 --> 00:03:49,98
pass that

201
00:03:49,98 --> 00:03:49,93
they

202
00:03:49,93 --> 00:03:49,88

unto his

205
00:03:49,78 --> 00:03:49,73

206
00:03:49,73 --> 00:03:49,68
there

207
00:03:49,68 --> 00:03:49,63
began to be

208

215
00:03:49,28 --> 00:03:49,23

219
00:03:49,754 --> 00:03:49,845
thus

220
00:03:49,845 --> 00:03:49,936
