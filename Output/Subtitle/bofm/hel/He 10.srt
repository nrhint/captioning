00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:04,6
Chapter 10 The Lord gives Nephi the sealing

2
00:00:04,6 --> 00:00:09,2
 power—He is empowered to bind and loose on earth and in

3
00:00:09,2 --> 00:00:13,8
 heaven—He commands the people to repent or

4
00:00:13,8 --> 00:00:18,4
 perish—The Spirit carries him from multitude to

5
00:00:18,4 --> 00:00:23,0
 multitude. About 21–20 B.C.

6
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:33,924
1 And it came to pass that there arose a division

7
00:00:33,924 --> 00:00:43,924
 among the people, insomuch that they divided

8
00:00:43,924 --> 00:00:53,924
 hither and thither and went their ways, leaving Nephi

9
00:00:53,924 --> 00:01:03,924
 alone, as he was standing in the midst of them

10
00:01:03,73 --> 00:01:08,063
2 And it came to pass that Nephi went his way

11
00:01:08,063 --> 00:01:12,396
 towards his own house, pondering upon the things which

12
00:01:12,396 --> 00:01:16,729
 the Lord had shown unto him

13
00:01:16,977 --> 00:01:22,406
3 And it came to pass as he was thus

14
00:01:22,406 --> 00:01:27,835
 pondering—being much cast down because of the wickedness of the

15
00:01:27,835 --> 00:01:33,264
 people of the Nephites, their secret works of

16
00:01:33,264 --> 00:01:38,693
 darkness, and their murderings, and their

17
00:01:38,693 --> 00:01:44,122
 plunderings, and all manner of iniquities—and it came to pass

18
00:01:44,122 --> 00:01:49,551
 as he was thus pondering in his heart, behold, a

19
00:01:49,551 --> 00:01:54,98
 voice came unto him saying

20
00:01:54,414 --> 00:02:04,7
4 Blessed art thou, Nephi, for those things which

21
00:02:04,7 --> 00:02:14,986
 thou hast done; for I have beheld how thou hast

22
00:02:14,986 --> 00:02:25,272
 with unwearyingness declared the word, which I have

23
00:02:25,272 --> 00:02:35,558
 given unto thee, unto this people. And thou hast

24
00:02:35,558 --> 00:02:45,844
 not feared them, and hast not sought thine own

25
00:02:45,844 --> 00:02:56,13
 life, but hast sought my will, and to keep my

26
00:02:56,13 --> 00:03:06,416
 commandments

27
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:12,615
5 And now, because thou hast done this with such

28
00:03:12,615 --> 00:03:19,044
 unwearyingness, behold, I will bless thee forever;

29
00:03:19,044 --> 00:03:25,473
 and I will make thee mighty in word and in deed,

30
00:03:25,473 --> 00:03:31,902
 in faith and in works; yea, even that all things

31
00:03:31,902 --> 00:03:38,331
 shall be done unto thee according to thy word, for

32
00:03:38,331 --> 00:03:44,76
 thou shalt not ask that which is contrary to my

33
00:03:44,76 --> 00:03:51,189
 will

34
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:52,031
6 Behold, thou art Nephi, and I am God. Behold, I

35
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:52,364
 declare it unto thee in the presence of mine

36
00:03:52,364 --> 00:03:52,697
 angels, that ye shall have power over this people, and

37
00:03:52,697 --> 00:03:53,03
 shall smite the earth with famine, and with

38
00:03:53,03 --> 00:03:53,363
 pestilence, and destruction, according to the wickedness

39
00:03:53,363 --> 00:03:53,696
 of this people

40
00:03:53,834 --> 00:04:03,434
7 Behold, I give unto you power, that whatsoever

41
00:04:03,434 --> 00:04:13,034
 ye shall seal on earth shall be sealed in heaven;

42
00:04:13,034 --> 00:04:22,634
 and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be

43
00:04:22,634 --> 00:04:32,234
 loosed in heaven; and thus shall ye have power among

44
00:04:32,234 --> 00:04:41,834
 this people

45
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:45,681
8 And thus, if ye shall say unto this temple it

46
00:04:45,681 --> 00:04:49,681
 shall be rent in twain, it shall be done

47
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:53,656
9 And if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou

48
00:04:53,656 --> 00:04:57,656
 cast down and become smooth, it shall be done

49
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:58,131
10 And behold, if ye shall say that God shall

50
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:58,631
 smite this people, it shall come to pass

51
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:03,381
11 And now behold, I command you, that ye shall go

52
00:05:03,381 --> 00:05:08,631
 and declare unto this people, that thus saith the

53
00:05:08,631 --> 00:05:13,881
 Lord God, who is the Almighty: Except ye repent

54
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:19,131
 ye shall be smitten, even unto destruction

55
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:23,844
12 And behold, now it came to pass that when the

56
00:05:23,844 --> 00:05:28,469
 Lord had spoken these words unto Nephi, he did stop

57
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:33,094
 and did not go unto his own house, but did return

58
00:05:33,094 --> 00:05:37,719
 unto the multitudes who were scattered about upon

59
00:05:37,719 --> 00:05:42,344
 the face of the land, and began to declare unto

60
00:05:42,344 --> 00:05:46,969
 them the word of the Lord which had been spoken

61
00:05:46,969 --> 00:05:51,594
 unto him, concerning their destruction if they did

62
00:05:51,594 --> 00:05:56,219
 not repent

63
00:05:56,156 --> 00:06:00,756
13 Now behold, notwithstanding that great miracle

64
00:06:00,756 --> 00:06:05,356
 which Nephi had done in telling them concerning

65
00:06:05,356 --> 00:06:09,956
 the death of the chief judge, they did harden their

66
00:06:09,956 --> 00:06:14,556
 hearts and did not hearken unto the words of the

67
00:06:14,556 --> 00:06:19,156
 Lord

68
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:25,346
14 Therefore Nephi did declare unto them the word

69
00:06:25,346 --> 00:06:30,846
 of the Lord, saying: Except ye repent, thus saith

70
00:06:30,846 --> 00:06:36,346
 the Lord, ye shall be smitten even unto

71
00:06:36,346 --> 00:06:41,846
 destruction

72
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:45,934
15 And it came to pass that when Nephi had

73
00:06:45,934 --> 00:06:50,767
 declared unto them the word, behold, they did still

74
00:06:50,767 --> 00:06:55,6
 harden their hearts and would not hearken unto his

75
00:06:55,6 --> 00:07:00,433
 words; therefore they did revile against him, and did

76
00:07:00,433 --> 00:07:05,266
 seek to lay their hands upon him that they might

77
00:07:05,266 --> 00:07:10,099
 cast him into prison

78
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:15,596
16 But behold, the power of God was with him, and

79
00:07:15,596 --> 00:07:21,096
 they could not take him to cast him into prison,

80
00:07:21,096 --> 00:07:26,596
 for he was taken by the Spirit and conveyed away

81
00:07:26,596 --> 00:07:32,096
 out of the midst of them

82
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:38,785
17 And it came to pass that thus he did go forth

83
00:07:38,785 --> 00:07:44,985
 in the Spirit, from multitude to multitude,

84
00:07:44,985 --> 00:07:51,185
 declaring the word of God, even until he had declared it

85
00:07:51,185 --> 00:07:57,385
 unto them all, or sent it forth among all the

86
00:07:57,385 --> 00:08:03,585
 people
