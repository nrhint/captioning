00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 10 The Lord gives Nephi the sealing

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
power—He is empowered to bind and loose on

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
earth and in heaven—He commands the people

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
to repent or perish—The Spirit carries him

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:03:45,
from multitude to multitude. About 21–20 B.C. 

6
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
1 And it came to pass that there arose

7
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
a division among the people, insomuch

8
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
that they divided hither and thither and

9
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
went their ways, leaving Nephi alone,

10
00:03:45,0 --> 00:07:15,
as he was standing in the midst of them.

11
00:07:15,0 --> 00:07:15,0
2 And it came to pass that Nephi

12
00:07:15,0 --> 00:07:15,0
went his way towards his own

13
00:07:15,0 --> 00:07:15,0
house, pondering upon the things

14
00:07:15,0 --> 00:12:44,
which the Lord had shown unto him.

15
00:12:44,0 --> 00:12:44,0
3 And it came to pass as he

16
00:12:44,0 --> 00:12:44,0
was thus pondering—being much

17
00:12:44,0 --> 00:12:44,0
cast down because of the

18
00:12:44,0 --> 00:12:44,0
wickedness of the people of the

19
00:12:44,0 --> 00:12:44,0
Nephites, their secret works

20
00:12:44,0 --> 00:12:44,0
of darkness, and their

21
00:12:44,0 --> 00:12:44,0
murderings, and their plunderings,

22
00:12:44,0 --> 00:12:44,0
and all manner of

23
00:12:44,0 --> 00:12:44,0
iniquities—and it came to pass as he was

24
00:12:44,0 --> 00:12:44,0
thus pondering in his heart,

25
00:12:44,0 --> 00:12:16,
behold, a voice came unto him saying:

26
00:12:16,0 --> 00:12:16,0
4 Blessed art thou, Nephi,

27
00:12:16,0 --> 00:12:16,0
for those things which thou

28
00:12:16,0 --> 00:12:16,0
hast done; for I have

29
00:12:16,0 --> 00:12:16,0
beheld how thou hast with

30
00:12:16,0 --> 00:12:16,0
unwearyingness declared the

31
00:12:16,0 --> 00:12:16,0
word, which I have given unto

32
00:12:16,0 --> 00:12:16,0
thee, unto this people. And

33
00:12:16,0 --> 00:12:16,0
thou hast not feared them,

34
00:12:16,0 --> 00:12:16,0
and hast not sought thine

35
00:12:16,0 --> 00:12:16,0
own life, but hast sought my

36
00:12:16,0 --> 00:17:26,
will, and to keep my commandments.

37
00:17:26,0 --> 00:17:26,0
5 And now, because thou

38
00:17:26,0 --> 00:17:26,0
hast done this with such

39
00:17:26,0 --> 00:17:26,0
unwearyingness, behold, I

40
00:17:26,0 --> 00:17:26,0
will bless thee forever;

41
00:17:26,0 --> 00:17:26,0
and I will make thee

42
00:17:26,0 --> 00:17:26,0
mighty in word and in deed,

43
00:17:26,0 --> 00:17:26,0
in faith and in works;

44
00:17:26,0 --> 00:17:26,0
yea, even that all things

45
00:17:26,0 --> 00:17:26,0
shall be done unto thee

46
00:17:26,0 --> 00:17:26,0
according to thy word, for

47
00:17:26,0 --> 00:17:26,0
thou shalt not ask that

48
00:17:26,0 --> 00:19:24,
which is contrary to my will.

49
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
6 Behold, thou art

50
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
Nephi, and I am God. Behold,

51
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
I declare it unto thee

52
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
in the presence of mine

53
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
angels, that ye shall

54
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
have power over this

55
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
people, and shall smite the

56
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
earth with famine, and

57
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
with pestilence, and

58
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
destruction, according to the

59
00:19:24,0 --> 00:18:56,
wickedness of this people.

60
00:18:56,0 --> 00:18:56,0
7 Behold, I give unto

61
00:18:56,0 --> 00:18:56,0
you power, that

62
00:18:56,0 --> 00:18:56,0
whatsoever ye shall seal on

63
00:18:56,0 --> 00:18:56,0
earth shall be sealed in

64
00:18:56,0 --> 00:18:56,0
heaven; and whatsoever

65
00:18:56,0 --> 00:18:56,0
ye shall loose on earth

66
00:18:56,0 --> 00:18:56,0
shall be loosed in

67
00:18:56,0 --> 00:18:56,0
heaven; and thus shall ye

68
00:18:56,0 --> 00:21:08,
have power among this people.

69
00:21:08,0 --> 00:21:08,0
8 And thus, if ye

70
00:21:08,0 --> 00:21:08,0
shall say unto this temple

71
00:21:08,0 --> 00:21:08,0
it shall be rent in

72
00:21:08,0 --> 00:20:40,
twain, it shall be done.

73
00:20:40,0 --> 00:20:40,0
9 And if ye shall

74
00:20:40,0 --> 00:20:40,0
say unto this

75
00:20:40,0 --> 00:20:40,0
mountain, Be thou cast

76
00:20:40,0 --> 00:20:40,0
down and become

77
00:20:40,0 --> 00:20:12,
smooth, it shall be done.

78
00:20:12,0 --> 00:20:12,0
10 And behold, if

79
00:20:12,0 --> 00:20:12,0
ye shall say

80
00:20:12,0 --> 00:20:12,0
that God shall smite

81
00:20:12,0 --> 00:20:12,0
this people, it

82
00:20:12,0 --> 00:19:44,
shall come to pass.

83
00:19:44,0 --> 00:19:44,0
11 And now

84
00:19:44,0 --> 00:19:44,0
behold, I command

85
00:19:44,0 --> 00:19:44,0
you, that ye shall

86
00:19:44,0 --> 00:19:44,0
go and declare

87
00:19:44,0 --> 00:19:44,0
unto this people,

88
00:19:44,0 --> 00:19:44,0
that thus saith

89
00:19:44,0 --> 00:19:44,0
the Lord God,

90
00:19:44,0 --> 00:19:44,0
who is the

91
00:19:44,0 --> 00:19:44,0
Almighty: Except ye

92
00:19:44,0 --> 00:19:44,0
repent ye shall be

93
00:19:44,0 --> 00:19:44,0
smitten, even

94
00:19:44,0 --> 00:20:56,
unto destruction.

95
00:20:56,0 --> 00:20:56,0
12 And behold,

96
00:20:56,0 --> 00:20:56,0
now it came to

97
00:20:56,0 --> 00:20:56,0
pass that when

98
00:20:56,0 --> 00:20:56,0
the Lord had

99
00:20:56,0 --> 00:20:56,0
spoken these

100
00:20:56,0 --> 00:20:56,0
words unto Nephi,

101
00:20:56,0 --> 00:20:56,0
he did stop and

102
00:20:56,0 --> 00:20:56,0
did not go unto

103
00:20:56,0 --> 00:20:56,0
his own house,

104
00:20:56,0 --> 00:20:56,0
but did return

105
00:20:56,0 --> 00:20:56,0
unto the

106
00:20:56,0 --> 00:20:56,0
multitudes who were

107
00:20:56,0 --> 00:20:56,0
scattered about

108
00:20:56,0 --> 00:20:56,0
upon the face

109
00:20:56,0 --> 00:20:56,0
of the land,

110
00:20:56,0 --> 00:20:56,0
and began to

111
00:20:56,0 --> 00:20:56,0
declare unto them

112
00:20:56,0 --> 00:20:56,0
the word of the

113
00:20:56,0 --> 00:20:56,0
Lord which had

114
00:20:56,0 --> 00:20:56,0
been spoken

115
00:20:56,0 --> 00:20:56,0
unto him,

116
00:20:56,0 --> 00:20:56,0
concerning their

117
00:20:56,0 --> 00:20:28,
destruction if they did not repent.

118
00:20:28,0 --> 00:20:28,0
13 Now behold,

119
00:20:28,0 --> 00:20:28,0


120
00:20:28,0 --> 00:20:28,0
notwithstanding that great

121
00:20:28,0 --> 00:20:28,0
miracle which

122
00:20:28,0 --> 00:20:28,0
Nephi had done

123
00:20:28,0 --> 00:20:28,0
in telling

124
00:20:28,0 --> 00:20:28,0
them concerning

125
00:20:28,0 --> 00:20:28,0
the death of

126
00:20:28,0 --> 00:20:28,0
the chief

127
00:20:28,0 --> 00:20:28,0
judge, they did

128
00:20:28,0 --> 00:20:28,0
harden their

129
00:20:28,0 --> 00:20:28,0
hearts and did not

130
00:20:28,0 --> 00:20:28,0
hearken unto

131
00:20:28,0 --> 00:22:40,
the words of the Lord.

132
00:22:40,0 --> 00:22:40,0
14 Therefore

133
00:22:40,0 --> 00:22:40,0
Nephi did

134
00:22:40,0 --> 00:22:40,0
declare unto

135
00:22:40,0 --> 00:22:40,0
them the word of

136
00:22:40,0 --> 00:22:40,0
the Lord,

137
00:22:40,0 --> 00:22:40,0
saying: Except

138
00:22:40,0 --> 00:22:40,0
ye repent,

139
00:22:40,0 --> 00:22:40,0
thus saith the

140
00:22:40,0 --> 00:22:40,0
Lord, ye

141
00:22:40,0 --> 00:22:40,0
shall be smitten

142
00:22:40,0 --> 00:23:52,
even unto destruction.

143
00:23:52,0 --> 00:23:52,0
15 And it

144
00:23:52,0 --> 00:23:52,0
came to pass

145
00:23:52,0 --> 00:23:52,0
that when

146
00:23:52,0 --> 00:23:52,0
Nephi had

147
00:23:52,0 --> 00:23:52,0
declared unto

148
00:23:52,0 --> 00:23:52,0
them the word,

149
00:23:52,0 --> 00:23:52,0
behold, they

150
00:23:52,0 --> 00:23:52,0
did still

151
00:23:52,0 --> 00:23:52,0
harden their

152
00:23:52,0 --> 00:23:52,0
hearts and

153
00:23:52,0 --> 00:23:52,0
would not

154
00:23:52,0 --> 00:23:52,0
hearken unto

155
00:23:52,0 --> 00:23:52,0
his words;

156
00:23:52,0 --> 00:23:52,0
therefore they

157
00:23:52,0 --> 00:23:52,0
did revile

158
00:23:52,0 --> 00:23:52,0
against him,

159
00:23:52,0 --> 00:23:52,0
and did seek

160
00:23:52,0 --> 00:23:52,0
to lay

161
00:23:52,0 --> 00:23:52,0
their hands upon

162
00:23:52,0 --> 00:23:52,0
him that

163
00:23:52,0 --> 00:23:24,
they might cast him into prison.

164
00:23:24,0 --> 00:23:24,0
16 But

165
00:23:24,0 --> 00:23:24,0
behold, the

166
00:23:24,0 --> 00:23:24,0
power of God

167
00:23:24,0 --> 00:23:24,0
was with

168
00:23:24,0 --> 00:23:24,0
him, and they

169
00:23:24,0 --> 00:23:24,0
could not

170
00:23:24,0 --> 00:23:24,0
take him to

171
00:23:24,0 --> 00:23:24,0
cast him

172
00:23:24,0 --> 00:23:24,0
into prison,

173
00:23:24,0 --> 00:23:24,0
for he was

174
00:23:24,0 --> 00:23:24,0
taken by

175
00:23:24,0 --> 00:23:24,0
the Spirit

176
00:23:24,0 --> 00:23:24,0
and conveyed

177
00:23:24,0 --> 00:23:24,0
away out of

178
00:23:24,0 --> 00:26:20,
the midst of them.

179
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
17 And it

180
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
came to

181
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
pass that

182
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
thus he did

183
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
go forth

184
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
in the

185
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
Spirit, from

186
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
multitude

187
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
to

188
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
multitude,

189
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
declaring the

190
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
word of God,

191
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
even until

192
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
he had

193
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
declared it

194
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
unto them

195
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
all, or

196
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
sent it

197
00:26:20,0 --> 00:28:32,
forth among all the people.

198
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
18 And it

199
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
came to

200
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
pass that

201
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
they

202
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
would not

203
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
hearken

204
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
unto his

205
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
words; and

206
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
there

207
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
began to be

208
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0


209
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
contentions,

210
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
insomuch that

211
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
they were

212
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
divided

213
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
against

214
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
themselves

215
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
and began

216
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
to slay

217
00:28:32,0 --> 00:29:44,
one another with the sword.

218
00:29:44,0 --> 00:29:44,0
19 And

219
00:29:44,0 --> 00:29:44,0
thus

220
00:29:44,0 --> 00:29:44,0
ended the

221
00:29:44,0 --> 00:29:44,0
seventy

222
00:29:44,0 --> 00:29:44,0
and first

223
00:29:44,0 --> 00:29:44,0
