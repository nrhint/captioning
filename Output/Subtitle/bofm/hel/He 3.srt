00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 3 Many Nephites migrate to the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
land northward—They build houses of cement

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and keep many records—Tens of thousands are

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
converted and baptized—The word of God

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
leads men to salvation—Nephi the son of

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:10:09,
Helaman fills the judgment seat. About 49–39 B.C. 

7
00:10:09,0 --> 00:10:09,0
1 And now it came to pass in the forty

8
00:10:09,0 --> 00:10:09,0
and third year of the reign of the

9
00:10:09,0 --> 00:10:09,0
judges, there was no contention among the

10
00:10:09,0 --> 00:10:09,0
people of Nephi save it were a little

11
00:10:09,0 --> 00:10:09,0
pride which was in the church, which did

12
00:10:09,0 --> 00:10:09,0
cause some little dissensions among the

13
00:10:09,0 --> 00:10:09,0
people, which affairs were settled in

14
00:10:09,0 --> 00:20:49,
the ending of the forty and third year.

15
00:20:49,0 --> 00:20:49,0
2 And there was no contention

16
00:20:49,0 --> 00:20:49,0
among the people in the forty and

17
00:20:49,0 --> 00:20:49,0
fourth year; neither was there much

18
00:20:49,0 --> 00:22:01,
contention in the forty and fifth year.

19
00:22:01,0 --> 00:22:01,0
3 And it came to pass in the

20
00:22:01,0 --> 00:22:01,0
forty and sixth, yea, there was

21
00:22:01,0 --> 00:22:01,0
much contention and many

22
00:22:01,0 --> 00:22:01,0
dissensions; in the which there were

23
00:22:01,0 --> 00:22:01,0
an exceedingly great many who

24
00:22:01,0 --> 00:22:01,0
departed out of the land of

25
00:22:01,0 --> 00:22:01,0
Zarahemla, and went forth unto the

26
00:22:01,0 --> 00:21:33,
land northward to inherit the land.

27
00:21:33,0 --> 00:21:33,0
4 And they did travel to an

28
00:21:33,0 --> 00:21:33,0
exceedingly great distance,

29
00:21:33,0 --> 00:21:33,0
insomuch that they came to large

30
00:21:33,0 --> 00:23:45,
bodies of water and many rivers.

31
00:23:45,0 --> 00:23:45,0
5 Yea, and even they did

32
00:23:45,0 --> 00:23:45,0
spread forth into all parts of

33
00:23:45,0 --> 00:23:45,0
the land, into whatever parts

34
00:23:45,0 --> 00:23:45,0
it had not been rendered

35
00:23:45,0 --> 00:23:45,0
desolate and without timber,

36
00:23:45,0 --> 00:23:45,0
because of the many inhabitants

37
00:23:45,0 --> 00:26:55,
who had before inherited the land.

38
00:26:55,0 --> 00:26:55,0
6 And now no part of the

39
00:26:55,0 --> 00:26:55,0
land was desolate, save it

40
00:26:55,0 --> 00:26:55,0
were for timber; but

41
00:26:55,0 --> 00:26:55,0
because of the greatness of the

42
00:26:55,0 --> 00:26:55,0
destruction of the people

43
00:26:55,0 --> 00:26:55,0
who had before inhabited

44
00:26:55,0 --> 00:34:03,
the land it was called desolate.

45
00:34:03,0 --> 00:34:03,0
7 And there being but

46
00:34:03,0 --> 00:34:03,0
little timber upon the face

47
00:34:03,0 --> 00:34:03,0
of the land, nevertheless

48
00:34:03,0 --> 00:34:03,0
the people who went

49
00:34:03,0 --> 00:34:03,0
forth became exceedingly

50
00:34:03,0 --> 00:34:03,0
expert in the working of

51
00:34:03,0 --> 00:34:03,0
cement; therefore they did

52
00:34:03,0 --> 00:34:03,0
build houses of cement, in

53
00:34:03,0 --> 00:42:15,
the which they did dwell.

54
00:42:15,0 --> 00:42:15,0
8 And it came to pass

55
00:42:15,0 --> 00:42:15,0
that they did multiply and

56
00:42:15,0 --> 00:42:15,0
spread, and did go

57
00:42:15,0 --> 00:42:15,0
forth from the land

58
00:42:15,0 --> 00:42:15,0
southward to the land northward,

59
00:42:15,0 --> 00:42:15,0
and did spread insomuch

60
00:42:15,0 --> 00:42:15,0
that they began to

61
00:42:15,0 --> 00:42:15,0
cover the face of the whole

62
00:42:15,0 --> 00:42:15,0
earth, from the sea

63
00:42:15,0 --> 00:42:15,0
south to the sea north, from

64
00:42:15,0 --> 00:49:59,
the sea west to the sea east.

65
00:49:59,0 --> 00:49:59,0
9 And the people who

66
00:49:59,0 --> 00:49:59,0
were in the land

67
00:49:59,0 --> 00:49:59,0
northward did dwell in tents,

68
00:49:59,0 --> 00:49:59,0
and in houses of cement,

69
00:49:59,0 --> 00:49:59,0
and they did suffer

70
00:49:59,0 --> 00:49:59,0
whatsoever tree should

71
00:49:59,0 --> 00:49:59,0
spring up upon the face

72
00:49:59,0 --> 00:49:59,0
of the land that it

73
00:49:59,0 --> 00:49:59,0
should grow up, that in

74
00:49:59,0 --> 00:49:59,0
time they might have

75
00:49:59,0 --> 00:49:59,0
timber to build their

76
00:49:59,0 --> 00:49:59,0
houses, yea, their cities,

77
00:49:59,0 --> 00:49:59,0
and their temples, and

78
00:49:59,0 --> 00:49:59,0
their synagogues, and

79
00:49:59,0 --> 00:49:59,0
their sanctuaries, and all

80
00:49:59,0 --> 00:52:41,
manner of their buildings.

81
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
10 And it came to

82
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
pass as timber was

83
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
exceedingly scarce in the

84
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
land northward, they

85
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
did send forth much

86
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:55,
by the way of shipping.

87
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
11 And thus they did

88
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
enable the people

89
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
in the land northward

90
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
that they might

91
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
build many cities, both

92
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:41,
of wood and of cement.

93
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
12 And it came to

94
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
pass that there

95
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
were many of the

96
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
people of Ammon, who

97
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
were Lamanites by

98
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
birth, did also go

99
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:55,
forth into this land.

100
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
13 And now there

101
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
are many

102
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
records kept of the

103
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
proceedings of

104
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
this people, by

105
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
many of this

106
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
people, which are

107
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
particular and very

108
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:41,
large, concerning them.

109
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
14 But behold,

110
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
a hundredth

111
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
part of the

112
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
proceedings of this

113
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
people, yea, the

114
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
account of the

115
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
Lamanites and

116
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
of the

117
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
Nephites, and their

118
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
wars, and

119
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
contentions, and

120
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
dissensions, and

121
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
their preaching,

122
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
and their

123
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
prophecies, and their

124
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
shipping and

125
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
their building of

126
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
ships, and

127
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
their building of

128
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
temples, and of

129
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
synagogues and

130
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
their

131
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
sanctuaries, and their

132
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
righteousness,

133
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
and their

134
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
wickedness, and

135
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
their murders, and

136
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
their robbings,

137
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
and their

138
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
plundering, and all

139
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
manner of

140
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
abominations and

141
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:55,
whoredoms, cannot be contained in this work.

142
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
15 But behold,

143
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
there are

144
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
many books and

145
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
many records of

146
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
every kind,

147
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
and they have

148
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
been kept

149
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:41,
chiefly by the Nephites.

150
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
16 And they

151
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
have been

152
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
handed down from

153
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
one

154
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
generation to another

155
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
by the

156
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
Nephites, even

157
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
until they have

158
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
fallen into

159
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
transgression

160
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
and have been

161
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
murdered,

162
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
plundered, and

163
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
hunted, and

164
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
driven forth,

165
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
and slain, and

166
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
scattered

167
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
upon the face

168
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
of the earth,

169
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
and mixed

170
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
with the

171
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
Lamanites until they

172
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
are no more

173
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
called the

174
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
Nephites,

175
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
becoming wicked,

176
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
and wild, and

177
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:55,
ferocious, yea, even becoming Lamanites.

178
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
17 And now I

179
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
return again

180
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
to mine

181
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
account;

182
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
therefore, what I have

183
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
spoken had

184
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
passed after

185
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
there had been

186
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
great

187
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
contentions, and

188
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
disturbances,

189
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
and wars, and

190
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
dissensions,

191
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
among the

192
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:41,
people of Nephi.

193
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
18 The forty

194
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
and sixth

195
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
year of the

196
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
reign of the

197
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:55,
judges ended;

198
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
19 And it

199
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
came to pass

200
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
that there

201
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
was still

202
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
great

203
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
contention in

204
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
the land,

205
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
yea, even in

206
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
the forty

207
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
and seventh

208
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
year, and

209
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:55,0
also in the

210
00:52:55,0 --> 00:52:41,
forty and eighth year.

211
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
20

212
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
Nevertheless

213
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
Helaman did

214
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
fill the

215
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
judgment-seat

216
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
with

217
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
justice and

218
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
equity; yea,

219
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
he did

220
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
observe to

221
00:52:41,0 --> 00:52:41,0
keep the

222
