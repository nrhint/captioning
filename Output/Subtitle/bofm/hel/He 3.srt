00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:08,167
Chapter 3 Many Nephites migrate to the land

2
00:00:08,167 --> 00:00:16,334
 northward—They build houses of cement and keep many

3
00:00:16,334 --> 00:00:24,501
 records—Tens of thousands are converted and

4
00:00:24,501 --> 00:00:32,668
 baptized—The word of God leads men to salvation—Nephi the

5
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:40,835
 son of Helaman fills the judgment seat. About

6
00:00:40,835 --> 00:00:49,002
 49–39 B.C.

7
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:55,026
1 And now it came to pass in the forty and third

8
00:00:55,026 --> 00:01:00,169
 year of the reign of the judges, there was no

9
00:01:00,169 --> 00:01:05,312
 contention among the people of Nephi save it were a

10
00:01:05,312 --> 00:01:10,455
 little pride which was in the church, which did cause

11
00:01:10,455 --> 00:01:15,598
 some little dissensions among the people, which

12
00:01:15,598 --> 00:01:20,741
 affairs were settled in the ending of the forty and

13
00:01:20,741 --> 00:01:25,884
 third year

14
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:30,886
2 And there was no contention among the people in

15
00:01:30,886 --> 00:01:35,886
 the forty and fourth year; neither was there much

16
00:01:35,886 --> 00:01:40,886
 contention in the forty and fifth year

17
00:01:40,5 --> 00:01:45,333
3 And it came to pass in the forty and sixth, yea,

18
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:50,166
 there was much contention and many dissensions;

19
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:54,999
 in the which there were an exceedingly great many

20
00:01:54,999 --> 00:01:59,832
 who departed out of the land of Zarahemla, and went

21
00:01:59,832 --> 00:02:04,665
 forth unto the land northward to inherit the

22
00:02:04,665 --> 00:02:09,498
 land

23
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:14,296
4 And they did travel to an exceedingly great

24
00:02:14,296 --> 00:02:18,629
 distance, insomuch that they came to large bodies of

25
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:22,962
 water and many rivers

26
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:29,243
5 Yea, and even they did spread forth into all

27
00:02:29,243 --> 00:02:35,643
 parts of the land, into whatever parts it had not

28
00:02:35,643 --> 00:02:42,043
 been rendered desolate and without timber, because of

29
00:02:42,043 --> 00:02:48,443
 the many inhabitants who had before inherited the

30
00:02:48,443 --> 00:02:54,843
 land

31
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:59,758
6 And now no part of the land was desolate, save

32
00:02:59,758 --> 00:03:05,008
 it were for timber; but because of the greatness of

33
00:03:05,008 --> 00:03:10,258
 the destruction of the people who had before

34
00:03:10,258 --> 00:03:15,508
 inhabited the land it was called desolate

35
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:35,196
7 And there being but little timber upon the face

36
00:03:35,196 --> 00:03:54,396
 of the land, nevertheless the people who went

37
00:03:54,396 --> 00:04:13,596
 forth became exceedingly expert in the working of

38
00:04:13,596 --> 00:04:32,796
 cement; therefore they did build houses of cement, in

39
00:04:32,796 --> 00:04:51,996
 the which they did dwell

40
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:51,858
8 And it came to pass that they did multiply and

41
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:52,025
 spread, and did go forth from the land southward to

42
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:52,192
 the land northward, and did spread insomuch that

43
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:52,359
 they began to cover the face of the whole earth,

44
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:52,526
 from the sea south to the sea north, from the sea

45
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:52,693
 west to the sea east

46
00:04:52,526 --> 00:05:00,526
9 And the people who were in the land northward

47
00:05:00,526 --> 00:05:08,526
 did dwell in tents, and in houses of cement, and

48
00:05:08,526 --> 00:05:16,526
 they did suffer whatsoever tree should spring up upon

49
00:05:16,526 --> 00:05:24,526
 the face of the land that it should grow up, that

50
00:05:24,526 --> 00:05:32,526
 in time they might have timber to build their

51
00:05:32,526 --> 00:05:40,526
 houses, yea, their cities, and their temples, and

52
00:05:40,526 --> 00:05:48,526
 their synagogues, and their sanctuaries, and all

53
00:05:48,526 --> 00:05:56,526
 manner of their buildings

54
00:05:56,323 --> 00:05:58,99
10 And it came to pass as timber was exceedingly

55
00:05:58,99 --> 00:06:01,657
 scarce in the land northward, they did send forth

56
00:06:01,657 --> 00:06:04,324
 much by the way of shipping

57
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,964
11 And thus they did enable the people in the land

58
00:06:06,964 --> 00:06:09,631
 northward that they might build many cities, both

59
00:06:09,631 --> 00:06:12,298
 of wood and of cement

60
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:12,605
12 And it came to pass that there were many of the

61
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:12,938
 people of Ammon, who were Lamanites by birth, did

62
00:06:12,938 --> 00:06:13,271
 also go forth into this land

63
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:13,923
13 And now there are many records kept of the

64
00:06:13,923 --> 00:06:14,673
 proceedings of this people, by many of this people,

65
00:06:14,673 --> 00:06:15,423
 which are particular and very large, concerning

66
00:06:15,423 --> 00:06:16,173
 them

67
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:23,159
14 But behold, a hundredth part of the proceedings

68
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:29,341
 of this people, yea, the account of the Lamanites

69
00:06:29,341 --> 00:06:35,523
 and of the Nephites, and their wars, and

70
00:06:35,523 --> 00:06:41,705
 contentions, and dissensions, and their preaching, and

71
00:06:41,705 --> 00:06:47,887
 their prophecies, and their shipping and their

72
00:06:47,887 --> 00:06:54,069
 building of ships, and their building of temples, and of

73
00:06:54,069 --> 00:07:00,251
 synagogues and their sanctuaries, and their

74
00:07:00,251 --> 00:07:06,433
 righteousness, and their wickedness, and their murders,

75
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:12,615
 and their robbings, and their plundering, and all

76
00:07:12,615 --> 00:07:18,797
 manner of abominations and whoredoms, cannot be

77
00:07:18,797 --> 00:07:24,979
 contained in this work

78
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:30,311
15 But behold, there are many books and many

79
00:07:30,311 --> 00:07:36,311
 records of every kind, and they have been kept chiefly

80
00:07:36,311 --> 00:07:42,311
 by the Nephites

81
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:48,47
16 And they have been handed down from one

82
00:07:48,47 --> 00:07:54,845
 generation to another by the Nephites, even until they

83
00:07:54,845 --> 00:08:01,22
 have fallen into transgression and have been

84
00:08:01,22 --> 00:08:07,595
 murdered, plundered, and hunted, and driven forth, and

85
00:08:07,595 --> 00:08:13,97
 slain, and scattered upon the face of the earth, and

86
00:08:13,97 --> 00:08:20,345
 mixed with the Lamanites until they are no more

87
00:08:20,345 --> 00:08:26,72
 called the Nephites, becoming wicked, and wild, and

88
00:08:26,72 --> 00:08:33,095
 ferocious, yea, even becoming Lamanites

89
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:40,497
17 And now I return again to mine account;

90
00:08:40,497 --> 00:08:47,247
 therefore, what I have spoken had passed after there had

91
00:08:47,247 --> 00:08:53,997
 been great contentions, and disturbances, and

92
00:08:53,997 --> 00:09:00,747
 wars, and dissensions, among the people of Nephi

93
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:03,973
18 The forty and sixth year of the reign of the

94
00:09:03,973 --> 00:09:07,473
 judges ended

95
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:12,231
19 And it came to pass that there was still great

96
00:09:12,231 --> 00:09:16,481
 contention in the land, yea, even in the forty and

97
00:09:16,481 --> 00:09:20,731
 seventh year, and also in the forty and eighth

98
00:09:20,731 --> 00:09:24,981
 year

99
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:37,402
20 Nevertheless Helaman did fill the judgment-seat

100
00:09:37,402 --> 00:09:49,973
 with justice and equity; yea, he did observe to

101
00:09:49,973 --> 00:10:02,544
 keep the statutes, and the judgments, and the

102
00:10:02,544 --> 00:10:15,115
 commandments of God; and he did do that which was right

103
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:27,686
 in the sight of God continually; and he did walk

104
00:10:27,686 --> 00:10:40,257
 after the ways of his father, insomuch that he did

105
00:10:40,257 --> 00:10:52,828
 prosper in the land

106
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:54,552
21 And it came to pass that he had two sons. He

107
00:10:54,552 --> 00:10:56,552
 gave unto the eldest the name of Nephi, and unto the

108
00:10:56,552 --> 00:10:58,552
 youngest, the name of Lehi. And they began to

109
00:10:58,552 --> 00:11:00,552
 grow up unto the Lord

110
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:00,727
22 And it came to pass that the wars and

111
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:00,927
 contentions began to cease, in a small degree, among the

112
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:01,127
 people of the Nephites, in the latter end of the

113
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:01,327
 forty and eighth year of the reign of the judges over

114
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:01,527
 the people of Nephi

115
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:05,677
23 And it came to pass in the forty and ninth year

116
00:11:05,677 --> 00:11:09,927
 of the reign of the judges, there was continual

117
00:11:09,927 --> 00:11:14,177
 peace established in the land, all save it were the

118
00:11:14,177 --> 00:11:18,427
 secret combinations which Gadianton the robber

119
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:22,677
 had established in the more settled parts of the

120
00:11:22,677 --> 00:11:26,927
 land, which at that time were not known unto those

121
00:11:26,927 --> 00:11:31,177
 who were at the head of government; therefore they

122
00:11:31,177 --> 00:11:35,427
 were not destroyed out of the land

123
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:39,628
24 And it came to pass that in this same year

124
00:11:39,628 --> 00:11:43,828
 there was exceedingly great prosperity in the church,

125
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:48,028
 insomuch that there were thousands who did join

126
00:11:48,028 --> 00:11:52,228
 themselves unto the church and were baptized unto

127
00:11:52,228 --> 00:11:56,428
 repentance

128
00:11:56,95 --> 00:12:01,55
25 And so great was the prosperity of the church,

129
00:12:01,55 --> 00:12:06,15
 and so many the blessings which were poured out

130
00:12:06,15 --> 00:12:10,75
 upon the people, that even the high priests and the

131
00:12:10,75 --> 00:12:15,35
 teachers were themselves astonished beyond

132
00:12:15,35 --> 00:12:19,95
 measure

133
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:24,822
26 And it came to pass that the work of the Lord

134
00:12:24,822 --> 00:12:30,072
 did prosper unto the baptizing and uniting to the

135
00:12:30,072 --> 00:12:35,322
 church of God, many souls, yea, even tens of

136
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:40,572
 thousands

137
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:45,893
27 Thus we may see that the Lord is merciful unto

138
00:12:45,893 --> 00:12:50,893
 all who will, in the sincerity of their hearts,

139
00:12:50,893 --> 00:12:55,893
 call upon his holy name

140
00:12:55,842 --> 00:13:02,509
28 Yea, thus we see that the gate of heaven is

141
00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:09,176
 open unto all, even to those who will believe on the

142
00:13:09,176 --> 00:13:15,843
 name of Jesus Christ, who is the Son of God

143
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:22,709
29 Yea, we see that whosoever will may lay hold

144
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:29,423
 upon the word of God, which is quick and powerful,

145
00:13:29,423 --> 00:13:36,137
 which shall divide asunder all the cunning and the

146
00:13:36,137 --> 00:13:42,851
 snares and the wiles of the devil, and lead the

147
00:13:42,851 --> 00:13:49,565
 man of Christ in a strait and narrow course across

148
00:13:49,565 --> 00:13:56,279
 that everlasting gulf of misery which is prepared

149
00:13:56,279 --> 00:14:02,993
 to engulf the wicked

150
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:08,675
30 And land their souls, yea, their immortal

151
00:14:08,675 --> 00:14:15,075
 souls, at the right hand of God in the kingdom of

152
00:14:15,075 --> 00:14:21,475
 heaven, to sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and with

153
00:14:21,475 --> 00:14:27,875
 Jacob, and with all our holy fathers, to go no more

154
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:34,275
 out

155
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:40,057
31 And in this year there was continual rejoicing

156
00:14:40,057 --> 00:14:45,807
 in the land of Zarahemla, and in all the regions

157
00:14:45,807 --> 00:14:51,557
 round about, even in all the land which was

158
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:57,307
 possessed by the Nephites

159
00:14:57,263 --> 00:15:02,463
32 And it came to pass that there was peace and

160
00:15:02,463 --> 00:15:07,663
 exceedingly great joy in the remainder of the forty

161
00:15:07,663 --> 00:15:12,863
 and ninth year; yea, and also there was continual

162
00:15:12,863 --> 00:15:18,063
 peace and great joy in the fiftieth year of the

163
00:15:18,063 --> 00:15:23,263
 reign of the judges

164
00:15:23,823 --> 00:15:28,99
33 And in the fifty and first year of the reign of

165
00:15:28,99 --> 00:15:34,157
 the judges there was peace also, save it were the

166
00:15:34,157 --> 00:15:39,324
 pride which began to enter into the church—not

167
00:15:39,324 --> 00:15:44,491
 into the church of God, but into the hearts of the

168
00:15:44,491 --> 00:15:49,658
 people who professed to belong to the church of

169
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:54,825
 God

170
00:15:54,754 --> 00:16:01,154
34 And they were lifted up in pride, even to the

171
00:16:01,154 --> 00:16:07,554
 persecution of many of their brethren. Now this was

172
00:16:07,554 --> 00:16:13,954
 a great evil, which did cause the more humble

173
00:16:13,954 --> 00:16:20,354
 part of the people to suffer great persecutions, and

174
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:26,754
 to wade through much affliction

175
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:32,938
35 Nevertheless they did fast and pray oft, and

176
00:16:32,938 --> 00:16:39,224
 did wax stronger and stronger in their humility, and

177
00:16:39,224 --> 00:16:45,51
 firmer and firmer in the faith of Christ, unto

178
00:16:45,51 --> 00:16:51,796
 the filling their souls with joy and consolation,

179
00:16:51,796 --> 00:16:58,082
 yea, even to the purifying and the sanctification of

180
00:16:58,082 --> 00:17:04,368
 their hearts, which sanctification cometh because

181
00:17:04,368 --> 00:17:10,654
 of their yielding their hearts unto God

182
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:15,463
36 And it came to pass that the fifty and second

183
00:17:15,463 --> 00:17:20,63
 year ended in peace also, save it were the

184
00:17:20,63 --> 00:17:25,797
 exceedingly great pride which had gotten into the hearts

185
00:17:25,797 --> 00:17:30,964
 of the people; and it was because of their

186
00:17:30,964 --> 00:17:36,131
 exceedingly great riches and their prosperity in the land;

187
00:17:36,131 --> 00:17:41,298
 and it did grow upon them from day to day

188
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:45,39
37 And it came to pass in the fifty and third year

189
00:17:45,39 --> 00:17:48,819
 of the reign of the judges, Helaman died, and his

190
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:52,248
 eldest son Nephi began to reign in his stead. And

191
00:17:52,248 --> 00:17:55,677
 it came to pass that he did fill the

192
00:17:55,677 --> 00:17:59,106
 judgment-seat with justice and equity; yea, he did keep the

193
00:17:59,106 --> 00:18:02,535
 commandments of God, and did walk in the ways of his

194
00:18:02,535 --> 00:18:05,964
 father.
