00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,167
Chapter 3 Many Nephites migrate to the

2
00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:02,334
land northward—They build houses of cement

3
00:00:02,334 --> 00:00:03,501
and keep many records—Tens of thousands are

4
00:00:03,501 --> 00:00:04,668
converted and baptized—The word of God

5
00:00:04,668 --> 00:00:05,835
leads men to salvation—Nephi the son of

6
00:00:05,835 --> 00:00:07,508
Helaman fills the judgment seat. About 49–39 B.C. 

7
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
1 And now it came to pass in the forty

8
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
and third year of the reign of the

9
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
judges, there was no contention among the

10
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
people of Nephi save it were a little

11
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
pride which was in the church, which did

12
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
cause some little dissensions among the

13
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
people, which affairs were settled in

14
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,975
the ending of the forty and third year.

15
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
2 And there was no contention

16
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
among the people in the forty and

17
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
fourth year; neither was there much

18
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,508
contention in the forty and fifth year.

19
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
3 And it came to pass in the

20
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
forty and sixth, yea, there was

21
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
much contention and many

22
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
dissensions; in the which there were

23
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
an exceedingly great many who

24
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
departed out of the land of

25
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
Zarahemla, and went forth unto the

26
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,975
land northward to inherit the land.

27
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
4 And they did travel to an

28
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
exceedingly great distance,

29
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
insomuch that they came to large

30
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,508
bodies of water and many rivers.

31
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
5 Yea, and even they did

32
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
spread forth into all parts of

33
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
the land, into whatever parts

34
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
it had not been rendered

35
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
desolate and without timber,

36
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
because of the many inhabitants

37
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,975
who had before inherited the land.

38
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
6 And now no part of the

39
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
land was desolate, save it

40
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
were for timber; but

41
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
because of the greatness of the

42
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
destruction of the people

43
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
who had before inhabited

44
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,508
the land it was called desolate.

45
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
7 And there being but

46
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
little timber upon the face

47
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
of the land, nevertheless

48
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
the people who went

49
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
forth became exceedingly

50
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
expert in the working of

51
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
cement; therefore they did

52
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
build houses of cement, in

53
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,975
the which they did dwell.

54
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
8 And it came to pass

55
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
that they did multiply and

56
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
spread, and did go

57
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
forth from the land

58
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
southward to the land northward,

59
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
and did spread insomuch

60
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
that they began to

61
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
cover the face of the whole

62
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
earth, from the sea

63
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
south to the sea north, from

64
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,508
the sea west to the sea east.

65
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
9 And the people who

66
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
were in the land

67
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
northward did dwell in tents,

68
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
and in houses of cement,

69
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
and they did suffer

70
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
whatsoever tree should

71
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
spring up upon the face

72
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
of the land that it

73
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
should grow up, that in

74
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
time they might have

75
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
timber to build their

76
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
houses, yea, their cities,

77
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
and their temples, and

78
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
their synagogues, and

79
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
their sanctuaries, and all

80
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,975
manner of their buildings.

81
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
10 And it came to

82
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
pass as timber was

83
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
exceedingly scarce in the

84
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
land northward, they

85
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
did send forth much

86
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,508
by the way of shipping.

87
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
11 And thus they did

88
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
enable the people

89
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
in the land northward

90
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
that they might

91
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
build many cities, both

92
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,975
of wood and of cement.

93
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
12 And it came to

94
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
pass that there

95
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
were many of the

96
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
people of Ammon, who

97
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
were Lamanites by

98
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
birth, did also go

99
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,508
forth into this land.

100
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
13 And now there

101
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
are many

102
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
records kept of the

103
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
proceedings of

104
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
this people, by

105
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
many of this

106
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
people, which are

107
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
particular and very

108
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,975
large, concerning them.

109
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
14 But behold,

110
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
a hundredth

111
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
part of the

112
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
proceedings of this

113
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
people, yea, the

114
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
account of the

115
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
Lamanites and

116
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
of the

117
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
Nephites, and their

118
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
wars, and

119
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
contentions, and

120
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
dissensions, and

121
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
their preaching,

122
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
and their

123
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
prophecies, and their

124
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
shipping and

125
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
their building of

126
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
ships, and

127
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
their building of

128
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
temples, and of

129
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
synagogues and

130
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
their

131
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
sanctuaries, and their

132
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
righteousness,

133
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
and their

134
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
wickedness, and

135
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
their murders, and

136
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
their robbings,

137
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
and their

138
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
plundering, and all

139
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
manner of

140
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
abominations and

141
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,508
whoredoms, cannot be contained in this work.

142
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
15 But behold,

143
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
there are

144
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
many books and

145
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
many records of

146
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
every kind,

147
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
and they have

148
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
been kept

149
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,975
chiefly by the Nephites.

150
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
16 And they

151
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
have been

152
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
handed down from

153
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
one

154
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
generation to another

155
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
by the

156
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
Nephites, even

157
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
until they have

158
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
fallen into

159
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
transgression

160
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
and have been

161
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
murdered,

162
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
plundered, and

163
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
hunted, and

164
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
driven forth,

165
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
and slain, and

166
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
scattered

167
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
upon the face

168
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
of the earth,

169
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
and mixed

170
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
with the

171
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
Lamanites until they

172
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
are no more

173
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
called the

174
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
Nephites,

175
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
becoming wicked,

176
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
and wild, and

177
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,508
ferocious, yea, even becoming Lamanites.

178
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
17 And now I

179
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
return again

180
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
to mine

181
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
account;

182
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
therefore, what I have

183
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
spoken had

184
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
passed after

185
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
there had been

186
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
great

187
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
contentions, and

188
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
disturbances,

189
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
and wars, and

190
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
dissensions,

191
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
among the

192
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,975
people of Nephi.

193
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
18 The forty

194
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
and sixth

195
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
year of the

196
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,975
reign of the

197
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:07,508
judges ended;

198
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
19 And it

199
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:07,508
came to pass
