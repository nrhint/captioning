00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 14 Samuel predicts light during the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
night and a new star at Christ’s

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
birth—Christ redeems men from temporal and spiritual

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
death—The signs of His death include three

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
days of darkness, the rending of the

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:07:29,
rocks, and great upheavals of nature. About 6 B.C. 

7
00:07:29,0 --> 00:07:29,0
1 And now it came to pass that Samuel,

8
00:07:29,0 --> 00:07:29,0
the Lamanite, did prophesy a great

9
00:07:29,0 --> 00:07:01,
many more things which cannot be written.

10
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
2 And behold, he said unto them:

11
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
Behold, I give unto you a sign; for

12
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
five years more cometh, and behold,

13
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
then cometh the Son of God to redeem

14
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,
all those who shall believe on his name.

15
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
3 And behold, this will I give

16
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
unto you for a sign at the time

17
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
of his coming; for behold, there

18
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
shall be great lights in heaven,

19
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
insomuch that in the night

20
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
before he cometh there shall be no

21
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
darkness, insomuch that it shall

22
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,
appear unto man as if it was day.

23
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
4 Therefore, there shall be one

24
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
day and a night and a day, as

25
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
if it were one day and there

26
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
were no night; and this shall be

27
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
unto you for a sign; for ye

28
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
shall know of the rising of the

29
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
sun and also of its setting;

30
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
therefore they shall know of a

31
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
surety that there shall be two days

32
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
and a night; nevertheless the

33
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
night shall not be darkened;

34
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,
and it shall be the night before he is born.

35
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
5 And behold, there shall a

36
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
new star arise, such an one as

37
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
ye never have beheld; and this

38
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,
also shall be a sign unto you.

39
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
6 And behold this is not

40
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
all, there shall be many

41
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,
signs and wonders in heaven.

42
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
7 And it shall come to

43
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
pass that ye shall

44
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
all be amazed, and

45
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
wonder, insomuch that ye

46
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,
shall fall to the earth.

47
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
8 And it shall

48
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
come to pass that

49
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
whosoever shall

50
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
believe on the Son of

51
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
God, the same shall

52
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,
have everlasting life.

53
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
9 And behold,

54
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
thus hath the Lord

55
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
commanded me, by

56
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
his angel, that I

57
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
should come and

58
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
tell this thing

59
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
unto you; yea, he

60
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
hath commanded

61
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
that I should

62
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
prophesy these things

63
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
unto you; yea, he

64
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
hath said unto

65
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
me: Cry unto this

66
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
people, repent and

67
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,
prepare the way of the Lord.

68
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
10 And now,

69
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
because I am a

70
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
Lamanite, and have

71
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
spoken unto you

72
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
the words which

73
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
the Lord hath

74
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
commanded me, and

75
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
because it was

76
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
hard against you,

77
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
ye are angry with

78
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
me and do seek

79
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
to destroy me,

80
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
and have cast me

81
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,
out from among you.

82
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
11 And ye shall

83
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
hear my words,

84
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
for, for this

85
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
intent have I

86
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
come up upon the

87
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
walls of this

88
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
city, that ye

89
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
might hear and

90
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
know of the

91
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
judgments of God

92
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
which do await

93
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
you because of

94
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
your iniquities,

95
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
and also that

96
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
ye might know

97
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,
the conditions of repentance;

98
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
12 And also

99
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
that ye might

100
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
know of the

101
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
coming of Jesus

102
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
Christ, the Son

103
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
of God, the

104
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
Father of heaven

105
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
and of earth,

106
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
the Creator

107
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
of all things

108
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
from the

109
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
beginning; and that

110
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
ye might know

111
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
of the signs

112
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
of his coming,

113
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
to the intent

114
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
that ye might

115
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,
believe on his name.

116
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
13 And if ye

117
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
believe on

118
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
his name ye

119
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
will repent of

120
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
all your sins,

121
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
that thereby

122
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
ye may have

123
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
a remission

124
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
of them

125
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,
through his merits.

126
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
14 And

127
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
behold, again,

128
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
another sign I

129
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
give unto

130
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
you, yea, a

131
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,
sign of his death.

132
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
15 For

133
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
behold, he surely

134
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
must die

135
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
that salvation

136
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
may come;

137
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
yea, it

138
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
behooveth him and

139
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
becometh

140
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
expedient that

141
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
he dieth,

142
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
to bring to

143
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
pass the

144
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
resurrection of

145
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
the dead,

146
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
that thereby

147
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
men may be

148
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
brought into

149
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
the presence

150
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,
of the Lord.

151
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
16 Yea,

152
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
behold, this

153
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
death bringeth

154
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
to pass the

155
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0


156
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
resurrection, and

157
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
redeemeth all

158
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
mankind from the

159
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
first

160
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
death—that

161
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
spiritual death;

162
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
for all

163
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
mankind, by the

164
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
fall of Adam

165
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
being cut

166
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
off from the

167
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
presence of

168
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
the Lord, are

169
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
considered

170
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
as dead,

171
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
both as to

172
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
things temporal

173
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
and to

174
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,
things spiritual.

175
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
17 But

176
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
behold, the

177
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
resurrection

178
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
of Christ

179
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
redeemeth

180
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
mankind, yea,

181
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
even all

182
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
mankind, and

183
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
bringeth

184
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
them back

185
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
into the

186
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,
presence of the Lord.

187
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
18 Yea,

188
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
and it

189
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
bringeth to

190
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
pass the

191
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
condition of

192
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
repentance,

193
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
that

194
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
whosoever

195
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
repenteth the

196
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
same is

197
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
not hewn

198
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
down and cast

199
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
into the

200
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
fire; but

201
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
whosoever

202
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
repenteth

203
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
not is

204
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
hewn down and

205
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
cast into

206
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
the fire;

207
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
and there

208
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
cometh

209
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
upon them

210
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
again a

211
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
spiritual

212
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
death, yea, a

213
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
second

214
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
death, for

215
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
they are cut

216
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
off again

217
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
as to

218
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,
things pertaining to righteousness.

219
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
19

220
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
Therefore

221
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
repent ye,

222
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
repent ye,

223
00:07:01,0 --> 00:07:01,0
