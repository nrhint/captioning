00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:09,167
Chapter 14 Samuel predicts light during the night

2
00:00:09,167 --> 00:00:18,334
 and a new star at Christ’s birth—Christ redeems

3
00:00:18,334 --> 00:00:27,501
 men from temporal and spiritual death—The signs of

4
00:00:27,501 --> 00:00:36,668
 His death include three days of darkness, the

5
00:00:36,668 --> 00:00:45,835
 rending of the rocks, and great upheavals of nature.

6
00:00:45,835 --> 00:00:55,002
 About 6 B.C.

7
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:58,489
1 And now it came to pass that Samuel, the

8
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:01,156
 Lamanite, did prophesy a great many more things which

9
00:01:01,156 --> 00:01:03,823
 cannot be written

10
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:10,797
2 And behold, he said unto them: Behold, I give

11
00:01:10,797 --> 00:01:17,797
 unto you a sign; for five years more cometh, and

12
00:01:17,797 --> 00:01:24,797
 behold, then cometh the Son of God to redeem all

13
00:01:24,797 --> 00:01:31,797
 those who shall believe on his name

14
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:36,591
3 And behold, this will I give unto you for a sign

15
00:01:36,591 --> 00:01:41,924
 at the time of his coming; for behold, there

16
00:01:41,924 --> 00:01:47,257
 shall be great lights in heaven, insomuch that in the

17
00:01:47,257 --> 00:01:52,59
 night before he cometh there shall be no darkness,

18
00:01:52,59 --> 00:01:57,923
 insomuch that it shall appear unto man as if it

19
00:01:57,923 --> 00:02:03,256
 was day

20
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:15,031
4 Therefore, there shall be one day and a night

21
00:02:15,031 --> 00:02:26,906
 and a day, as if it were one day and there were no

22
00:02:26,906 --> 00:02:38,781
 night; and this shall be unto you for a sign; for

23
00:02:38,781 --> 00:02:50,656
 ye shall know of the rising of the sun and also of

24
00:02:50,656 --> 00:03:02,531
 its setting; therefore they shall know of a surety

25
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:14,406
 that there shall be two days and a night;

26
00:03:14,406 --> 00:03:26,281
 nevertheless the night shall not be darkened; and it

27
00:03:26,281 --> 00:03:38,156
 shall be the night before he is born

28
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:41,519
5 And behold, there shall a new star arise, such

29
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,186
 an one as ye never have beheld; and this also shall

30
00:03:44,186 --> 00:03:46,853
 be a sign unto you

31
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:50,827
6 And behold this is not all, there shall be many

32
00:03:50,827 --> 00:03:54,827
 signs and wonders in heaven

33
00:03:54,801 --> 00:04:00,134
7 And it shall come to pass that ye shall all be

34
00:04:00,134 --> 00:04:05,467
 amazed, and wonder, insomuch that ye shall fall to

35
00:04:05,467 --> 00:04:10,8
 the earth

36
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:11,084
8 And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall

37
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:11,417
 believe on the Son of God, the same shall have

38
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:11,75
 everlasting life

39
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,084
9 And behold, thus hath the Lord commanded me, by

40
00:04:12,084 --> 00:04:12,917
 his angel, that I should come and tell this thing

41
00:04:12,917 --> 00:04:13,75
 unto you; yea, he hath commanded that I should

42
00:04:13,75 --> 00:04:14,583
 prophesy these things unto you; yea, he hath said

43
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:15,416
 unto me: Cry unto this people, repent and prepare the

44
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:16,249
 way of the Lord

45
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:22,223
10 And now, because I am a Lamanite, and have

46
00:04:22,223 --> 00:04:27,623
 spoken unto you the words which the Lord hath

47
00:04:27,623 --> 00:04:33,023
 commanded me, and because it was hard against you, ye are

48
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:38,423
 angry with me and do seek to destroy me, and have

49
00:04:38,423 --> 00:04:43,823
 cast me out from among you

50
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:48,25
11 And ye shall hear my words, for, for this

51
00:04:48,25 --> 00:04:53,417
 intent have I come up upon the walls of this city, that

52
00:04:53,417 --> 00:04:58,584
 ye might hear and know of the judgments of God

53
00:04:58,584 --> 00:05:03,751
 which do await you because of your iniquities, and

54
00:05:03,751 --> 00:05:08,918
 also that ye might know the conditions of

55
00:05:08,918 --> 00:05:14,085
 repentance

56
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:19,748
12 And also that ye might know of the coming of

57
00:05:19,748 --> 00:05:24,748
 Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of heaven

58
00:05:24,748 --> 00:05:29,748
 and of earth, the Creator of all things from the

59
00:05:29,748 --> 00:05:34,748
 beginning; and that ye might know of the signs of

60
00:05:34,748 --> 00:05:39,748
 his coming, to the intent that ye might believe on

61
00:05:39,748 --> 00:05:44,748
 his name

62
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:51,345
13 And if ye believe on his name ye will repent of

63
00:05:51,345 --> 00:05:58,012
 all your sins, that thereby ye may have a

64
00:05:58,012 --> 00:06:04,679
 remission of them through his merits

65
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:10,798
14 And behold, again, another sign I give unto

66
00:06:10,798 --> 00:06:16,798
 you, yea, a sign of his death

67
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:22,776
15 For behold, he surely must die that salvation

68
00:06:22,776 --> 00:06:28,776
 may come; yea, it behooveth him and becometh

69
00:06:28,776 --> 00:06:34,776
 expedient that he dieth, to bring to pass the

70
00:06:34,776 --> 00:06:40,776
 resurrection of the dead, that thereby men may be brought

71
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:46,776
 into the presence of the Lord

72
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:52,64
16 Yea, behold, this death bringeth to pass the

73
00:06:52,64 --> 00:06:58,807
 resurrection, and redeemeth all mankind from the

74
00:06:58,807 --> 00:07:04,974
 first death—that spiritual death; for all mankind, by

75
00:07:04,974 --> 00:07:11,141
 the fall of Adam being cut off from the presence

76
00:07:11,141 --> 00:07:17,308
 of the Lord, are considered as dead, both as to

77
00:07:17,308 --> 00:07:23,475
 things temporal and to things spiritual

78
00:07:23,41 --> 00:07:28,743
17 But behold, the resurrection of Christ

79
00:07:28,743 --> 00:07:34,076
 redeemeth mankind, yea, even all mankind, and bringeth

80
00:07:34,076 --> 00:07:39,409
 them back into the presence of the Lord

81
00:07:39,96 --> 00:07:45,674
18 Yea, and it bringeth to pass the condition of

82
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:51,388
 repentance, that whosoever repenteth the same is

83
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:57,102
 not hewn down and cast into the fire; but whosoever

84
00:07:57,102 --> 00:08:02,816
 repenteth not is hewn down and cast into the fire;

85
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:08,53
 and there cometh upon them again a spiritual

86
00:08:08,53 --> 00:08:14,244
 death, yea, a second death, for they are cut off again

87
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:19,958
 as to things pertaining to righteousness

88
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:24,616
19 Therefore repent ye, repent ye, lest by knowing

89
00:08:24,616 --> 00:08:29,866
 these things and not doing them ye shall suffer

90
00:08:29,866 --> 00:08:35,116
 yourselves to come under condemnation, and ye are

91
00:08:35,116 --> 00:08:40,366
 brought down unto this second death

92
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:46,02
20 But behold, as I said unto you concerning

93
00:08:46,02 --> 00:08:51,353
 another sign, a sign of his death, behold, in that day

94
00:08:51,353 --> 00:08:56,686
 that he shall suffer death the sun shall be

95
00:08:56,686 --> 00:09:02,019
 darkened and refuse to give his light unto you; and also

96
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:07,352
 the moon and the stars; and there shall be no

97
00:09:07,352 --> 00:09:12,685
 light upon the face of this land, even from the time

98
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:18,018
 that he shall suffer death, for the space of three

99
00:09:18,018 --> 00:09:23,351
 days, to the time that he shall rise again from

100
00:09:23,351 --> 00:09:28,684
 the dead

101
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:34,902
21 Yea, at the time that he shall yield up the

102
00:09:34,902 --> 00:09:40,902
 ghost there shall be thunderings and lightnings for

103
00:09:40,902 --> 00:09:46,902
 the space of many hours, and the earth shall shake

104
00:09:46,902 --> 00:09:52,902
 and tremble; and the rocks which are upon the face

105
00:09:52,902 --> 00:09:58,902
 of this earth, which are both above the earth and

106
00:09:58,902 --> 00:10:04,902
 beneath, which ye know at this time are solid, or

107
00:10:04,902 --> 00:10:10,902
 the more part of it is one solid mass, shall be

108
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:16,902
 broken up

109
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:24,533
22 Yea, they shall be rent in twain, and shall

110
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:32,283
 ever after be found in seams and in cracks, and in

111
00:10:32,283 --> 00:10:40,033
 broken fragments upon the face of the whole earth,

112
00:10:40,033 --> 00:10:47,783
 yea, both above the earth and beneath

113
00:10:47,48 --> 00:10:54,08
23 And behold, there shall be great tempests, and

114
00:10:54,08 --> 00:11:00,68
 there shall be many mountains laid low, like unto

115
00:11:00,68 --> 00:11:07,28
 a valley, and there shall be many places which are

116
00:11:07,28 --> 00:11:13,88
 now called valleys which shall become mountains,

117
00:11:13,88 --> 00:11:20,48
 whose height is great

118
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:28,946
24 And many highways shall be broken up, and many

119
00:11:28,946 --> 00:11:37,446
 cities shall become desolate

120
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:45,33
25 And many graves shall be opened, and shall

121
00:11:45,33 --> 00:11:52,663
 yield up many of their dead; and many saints shall

122
00:11:52,663 --> 00:11:59,996
 appear unto many

123
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:06,62
26 And behold, thus hath the angel spoken unto me;

124
00:12:06,62 --> 00:12:13,287
 for he said unto me that there should be

125
00:12:13,287 --> 00:12:19,954
 thunderings and lightnings for the space of many hours

126
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:24,272
27 And he said unto me that while the thunder and

127
00:12:24,272 --> 00:12:28,872
 the lightning lasted, and the tempest, that these

128
00:12:28,872 --> 00:12:33,472
 things should be, and that darkness should cover

129
00:12:33,472 --> 00:12:38,072
 the face of the whole earth for the space of three

130
00:12:38,072 --> 00:12:42,672
 days

131
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:48,062
28 And the angel said unto me that many shall see

132
00:12:48,062 --> 00:12:53,729
 greater things than these, to the intent that they

133
00:12:53,729 --> 00:12:59,396
 might believe that these signs and these wonders

134
00:12:59,396 --> 00:13:05,063
 should come to pass upon all the face of this

135
00:13:05,063 --> 00:13:10,73
 land, to the intent that there should be no cause for

136
00:13:10,73 --> 00:13:16,397
 unbelief among the children of men

137
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:21,295
29 And this to the intent that whosoever will

138
00:13:21,295 --> 00:13:26,495
 believe might be saved, and that whosoever will not

139
00:13:26,495 --> 00:13:31,695
 believe, a righteous judgment might come upon them;

140
00:13:31,695 --> 00:13:36,895
 and also if they are condemned they bring upon

141
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:42,095
 themselves their own condemnation

142
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:48,588
30 And now remember, remember, my brethren, that

143
00:13:48,588 --> 00:13:55,088
 whosoever perisheth, perisheth unto himself; and

144
00:13:55,088 --> 00:14:01,588
 whosoever doeth iniquity, doeth it unto himself; for

145
00:14:01,588 --> 00:14:08,088
 behold, ye are free; ye are permitted to act for

146
00:14:08,088 --> 00:14:14,588
 yourselves; for behold, God hath given unto you a

147
00:14:14,588 --> 00:14:21,088
 knowledge and he hath made you free

148
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:28,461
31 He hath given unto you that ye might know good

149
00:14:28,461 --> 00:14:34,961
 from evil, and he hath given unto you that ye

150
00:14:34,961 --> 00:14:41,461
 might choose life or death; and ye can do good and be

151
00:14:41,461 --> 00:14:47,961
 restored unto that which is good, or have that

152
00:14:47,961 --> 00:14:54,461
 which is good restored unto you; or ye can do evil,

153
00:14:54,461 --> 00:15:00,961
 and have that which is evil restored unto you.
