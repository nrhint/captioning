00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 12 Men are unstable and foolish and

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
quick to do evil—The Lord chastens His people—The

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
nothingness of men is compared with the power of

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
God—In the day of judgment, men will gain

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:11:43,
everlasting life or everlasting damnation. About 6 B.C. 

6
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
1 And thus we can behold how false, and

7
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
also the unsteadiness of the hearts of the

8
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
children of men; yea, we can see that the Lord

9
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
in his great infinite goodness doth bless

10
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:57,
and prosper those who put their trust in him.

11
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
2 Yea, and we may see at the very time

12
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
when he doth prosper his people, yea, in the

13
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
increase of their fields, their flocks and

14
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
their herds, and in gold, and in silver,

15
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
and in all manner of precious things of

16
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
every kind and art; sparing their lives, and

17
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
delivering them out of the hands of their

18
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
enemies; softening the hearts of their

19
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
enemies that they should not declare wars

20
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
against them; yea, and in fine, doing all

21
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
things for the welfare and happiness of his

22
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
people; yea, then is the time that they do

23
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
harden their hearts, and do forget the

24
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
Lord their God, and do trample under their

25
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
feet the Holy One—yea, and this because of

26
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:43,
their ease, and their exceedingly great prosperity.

27
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
3 And thus we see that except the

28
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
Lord doth chasten his people with many

29
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
afflictions, yea, except he doth visit

30
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
them with death and with terror, and

31
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
with famine and with all manner of

32
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:57,
pestilence, they will not remember him.

33
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
4 O how foolish, and how vain, and

34
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
how evil, and devilish, and how quick

35
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
to do iniquity, and how slow to do

36
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
good, are the children of men; yea,

37
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
how quick to hearken unto the words

38
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
of the evil one, and to set their

39
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:43,
hearts upon the vain things of the world!

40
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
5 Yea, how quick to be lifted up

41
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
in pride; yea, how quick to boast,

42
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
and do all manner of that which is

43
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
iniquity; and how slow are they

44
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
to remember the Lord their God, and

45
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
to give ear unto his counsels,

46
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:57,
yea, how slow to walk in wisdom’s paths!

47
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
6 Behold, they do not desire

48
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
that the Lord their God, who hath

49
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
created them, should rule and

50
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
reign over them; notwithstanding

51
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
his great goodness and his mercy

52
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
towards them, they do set at

53
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
naught his counsels, and they will

54
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:43,
not that he should be their guide.

55
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
7 O how great is the

56
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
nothingness of the children of

57
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
men; yea, even they are less

58
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:57,
than the dust of the earth.

59
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
8 For behold, the dust

60
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
of the earth moveth

61
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
hither and thither, to

62
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
the dividing asunder,

63
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
at the command of our

64
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:43,
great and everlasting God.

65
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
9 Yea, behold at

66
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
his voice do the

67
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
hills and the mountains

68
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:57,
tremble and quake.

69
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
10 And by the

70
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
power of his voice

71
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
they are broken

72
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
up, and become

73
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
smooth, yea,

74
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:43,
even like unto a valley.

75
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
11 Yea, by the

76
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
power of his

77
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
voice doth the

78
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:57,
whole earth shake;

79
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
12 Yea, by the

80
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
power of his

81
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
voice, do the

82
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
foundations

83
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
rock, even to

84
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:43,
the very center.

85
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
13 Yea, and

86
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
if he say unto

87
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
the

88
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:57,
earth—Move—it is moved.

89
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
14 Yea, if

90
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
he say unto

91
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
the

92
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
earth—Thou shalt go

93
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
back, that it

94
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
lengthen

95
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
out the day

96
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
for many

97
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:43,
hours—it is done;

98
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
15 And

99
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
thus, according

100
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
to his

101
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
word the earth

102
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
goeth

103
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
back, and it

104
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
appeareth

105
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
unto man that

106
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
the sun

107
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
standeth

108
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
still; yea, and

109
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
behold,

110
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
this is so;

111
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
for surely it

112
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
is the

113
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
earth that

114
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:57,
moveth and not the sun.

115
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
16 And

116
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
behold, also,

117
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
if he say

118
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
unto the

119
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
waters of

120
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
the great

121
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
deep—Be

122
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
thou dried

123
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:43,
up—it is done.

124
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
17

125
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
Behold, if he

126
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
say unto

127
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
this

128
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
mountain—Be

129
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
thou raised

130
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
up, and

131
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
come over

132
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
and fall

133
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
upon

134
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
that city,

135
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
that it be

136
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
buried

137
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:57,
up—behold it is done.

138
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
18 And

139
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
behold,

140
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
if a man

141
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
hide up

142
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
a

143
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
treasure in

144
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
the earth,

145
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
and the

146
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
Lord

147
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
shall

148
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
say—Let it

149
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
be

150
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
accursed,

151
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
because of

152
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
the

153
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
iniquity of

154
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
him who

155
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
hath hid

156
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
it

157
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:43,
up—behold, it shall be accursed.

158
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
19 And

159
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
if the

160
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
Lord

161
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
shall

162
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
say—Be

163
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
thou

164
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
accursed,

165
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
that no

166
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
man

167
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
shall find

168
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
thee

169
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
from this

170
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
time

171
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0


172
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
henceforth and

173
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0


174
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0


175
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
forever—behold, no

176
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
man

177
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
getteth it

178
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:57,
henceforth and forever.

179
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
20 And

180
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0


181
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
behold, if

182
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
the

183
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
Lord

184
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
shall say

185
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
unto

186
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
a

187
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0


188
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
man—Because of

189
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
thine

190
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0


191
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
iniquities,

192
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
thou

193
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
shalt be

194
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0


195
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
accursed

196
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:43,
forever—it shall be done.

197
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
21

198
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
And if

199
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
the

200
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
Lord

201
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
shall

202
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0


203
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0


204
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
say—Because of

205
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
thine

206
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0


207
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0


208
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
iniquities

209
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
thou

210
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
shalt be

211
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
cut

212
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
off

213
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
from

214
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
my

215
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0


216
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
presence—he

217
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
will

218
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:57,
cause that it shall be so.

219
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
22

220
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
And wo

221
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
unto

222
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
him

223
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
