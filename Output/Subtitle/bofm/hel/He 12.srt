1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:28,6
Chapter 12 Men are unstable and foolish and quick

2
00:00:28,6 --> 00:00:57,2
 to do evil—The Lord chastens His people—The

3
00:00:57,2 --> 00:01:25,8
 nothingness of men is compared with the power of God—In

4
00:01:25,8 --> 00:01:54,4
 the day of judgment, men will gain everlasting

5
00:01:54,4 --> 00:02:23,0
 life or everlasting damnation. About 6 B.C.

6
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:34,743
1 And thus we can behold how false, and also the

7
00:02:34,743 --> 00:02:45,943
 unsteadiness of the hearts of the children of men;

8
00:02:45,943 --> 00:02:57,143
 yea, we can see that the Lord in his great

9
00:02:57,143 --> 00:03:08,343
 infinite goodness doth bless and prosper those who put

10
00:03:08,343 --> 00:03:19,543
 their trust in him

11
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,509
2 Yea, and we may see at the very time when he

12
00:03:20,509 --> 00:03:21,652
 doth prosper his people, yea, in the increase of

13
00:03:21,652 --> 00:03:22,795
 their fields, their flocks and their herds, and in

14
00:03:22,795 --> 00:03:23,938
 gold, and in silver, and in all manner of precious

15
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:25,081
 things of every kind and art; sparing their lives,

16
00:03:25,081 --> 00:03:26,224
 and delivering them out of the hands of their

17
00:03:26,224 --> 00:03:27,367
 enemies; softening the hearts of their enemies that

18
00:03:27,367 --> 00:03:28,51
 they should not declare wars against them; yea, and

19
00:03:28,51 --> 00:03:29,653
 in fine, doing all things for the welfare and

20
00:03:29,653 --> 00:03:30,796
 happiness of his people; yea, then is the time that

21
00:03:30,796 --> 00:03:31,939
 they do harden their hearts, and do forget the Lord

22
00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:33,082
 their God, and do trample under their feet the Holy

23
00:03:33,082 --> 00:03:34,225
 One—yea, and this because of their ease, and

24
00:03:34,225 --> 00:03:35,368
 their exceedingly great prosperity

25
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:35,315
3 And thus we see that except the Lord doth

26
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:35,315
 chasten his people with many afflictions, yea, except he

27
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:35,315
 doth visit them with death and with terror, and

28
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:35,315
 with famine and with all manner of pestilence, they

29
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:35,315
 will not remember him

30
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:47,949
4 O how foolish, and how vain, and how evil, and

31
00:03:47,949 --> 00:03:59,949
 devilish, and how quick to do iniquity, and how

32
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:11,949
 slow to do good, are the children of men; yea, how

33
00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:23,949
 quick to hearken unto the words of the evil one, and

34
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:35,949
 to set their hearts upon the vain things of the

35
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:47,949
 world

36
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:47,921
5 Yea, how quick to be lifted up in pride; yea,

37
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:48,121
 how quick to boast, and do all manner of that which

38
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:48,321
 is iniquity; and how slow are they to remember the

39
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:48,521
 Lord their God, and to give ear unto his

40
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:48,721
 counsels, yea, how slow to walk in wisdom’s paths

41
00:04:48,655 --> 00:05:00,655
6 Behold, they do not desire that the Lord their

42
00:05:00,655 --> 00:05:12,655
 God, who hath created them, should rule and reign

43
00:05:12,655 --> 00:05:24,655
 over them; notwithstanding his great goodness and

44
00:05:24,655 --> 00:05:36,655
 his mercy towards them, they do set at naught his

45
00:05:36,655 --> 00:05:48,655
 counsels, and they will not that he should be their

46
00:05:48,655 --> 00:06:00,655
 guide

47
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:03,094
7 O how great is the nothingness of the children

48
00:06:03,094 --> 00:06:05,761
 of men; yea, even they are less than the dust of

49
00:06:05,761 --> 00:06:08,428
 the earth

50
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:21,734
8 For behold, the dust of the earth moveth hither

51
00:06:21,734 --> 00:06:35,067
 and thither, to the dividing asunder, at the

52
00:06:35,067 --> 00:06:48,4
 command of our great and everlasting God

53
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:52,275
9 Yea, behold at his voice do the hills and the

54
00:06:52,275 --> 00:06:56,275
 mountains tremble and quake

55
00:06:56,249 --> 00:07:06,916
10 And by the power of his voice they are broken

56
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:17,583
 up, and become smooth, yea, even like unto a

57
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:28,25
 valley

58
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:48,148
11 Yea, by the power of his voice doth the whole

59
00:07:48,148 --> 00:08:08,148
 earth shake

60
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:31,521
12 Yea, by the power of his voice, do the

61
00:08:31,521 --> 00:08:55,021
 foundations rock, even to the very center

62
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:59,869
13 Yea, and if he say unto the earth—Move—it is

63
00:08:59,869 --> 00:09:03,869
 moved

64
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:11,843
14 Yea, if he say unto the earth—Thou shalt go

65
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:19,843
 back, that it lengthen out the day for many hours—it

66
00:09:19,843 --> 00:09:27,843
 is done

67
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,767
15 And thus, according to his word the earth goeth

68
00:09:29,767 --> 00:09:31,767
 back, and it appeareth unto man that the sun

69
00:09:31,767 --> 00:09:33,767
 standeth still; yea, and behold, this is so; for

70
00:09:33,767 --> 00:09:35,767
 surely it is the earth that moveth and not the sun

71
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:55,742
16 And behold, also, if he say unto the waters of

72
00:09:55,742 --> 00:10:15,742
 the great deep—Be thou dried up—it is done

73
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,282
17 Behold, if he say unto this mountain—Be thou

74
00:10:18,282 --> 00:10:20,949
 raised up, and come over and fall upon that city,

75
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:23,616
 that it be buried up—behold it is done

76
00:10:23,59 --> 00:10:27,59
18 And behold, if a man hide up a treasure in the

77
00:10:27,59 --> 00:10:31,59
 earth, and the Lord shall say—Let it be accursed,

78
00:10:31,59 --> 00:10:35,59
 because of the iniquity of him who hath hid it

79
00:10:35,59 --> 00:10:39,59
 up—behold, it shall be accursed

80
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:43,539
19 And if the Lord shall say—Be thou accursed,

81
00:10:43,539 --> 00:10:47,539
 that no man shall find thee from this time henceforth

82
00:10:47,539 --> 00:10:51,539
 and forever—behold, no man getteth it henceforth

83
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:55,539
 and forever

84
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,155
20 And behold, if the Lord shall say unto a

85
00:10:58,155 --> 00:11:00,822
 man—Because of thine iniquities, thou shalt be accursed

86
00:11:00,822 --> 00:11:03,489
 forever—it shall be done

87
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:06,13
21 And if the Lord shall say—Because of thine

88
00:11:06,13 --> 00:11:08,797
 iniquities thou shalt be cut off from my presence—he

89
00:11:08,797 --> 00:11:11,464
 will cause that it shall be so

90
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:13,037
22 And wo unto him to whom he shall say this, for

91
00:11:13,037 --> 00:11:14,637
 it shall be unto him that will do iniquity, and he

92
00:11:14,637 --> 00:11:16,237
 cannot be saved; therefore, for this cause, that

93
00:11:16,237 --> 00:11:17,837
 men might be saved, hath repentance been declared

94
00:11:17,837 --> 00:11:19,437


95
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:37,543
25 And I would that all men might be saved. But we

96
00:02:37,543 --> 00:02:51,543
 read that in the great and last day there are

97
00:02:51,543 --> 00:03:05,543
 some who shall be cast out, yea, who shall be cast

98
00:03:05,543 --> 00:03:19,543
 off from the presence of the Lord

99
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:19,366
26 Yea, who shall be consigned to a state of

100
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:19,366
 endless misery, fulfilling the words which say: They

101
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:19,366
 that have done good shall have everlasting life; and

102
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:19,366
 they that have done evil shall have everlasting

103
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:19,366
 damnation. And thus it is. Amen.
