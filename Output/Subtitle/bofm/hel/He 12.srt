1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:09,2
Chapter 12 Men are unstable and foolish and

2
00:00:09,2 --> 00:00:18,4
quick to do evil—The Lord chastens His people—The

3
00:00:18,4 --> 00:00:27,6
nothingness of men is compared with the power of

4
00:00:27,6 --> 00:00:36,8
God—In the day of judgment, men will gain

5
00:00:36,8 --> 00:00:46,914
everlasting life or everlasting damnation. About 6 B.C. 

6
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:53,914
1 And thus we can behold how false, and

7
00:00:53,914 --> 00:01:00,914
also the unsteadiness of the hearts of the

8
00:01:00,914 --> 00:01:07,914
children of men; yea, we can see that the Lord

9
00:01:07,914 --> 00:01:14,914
in his great infinite goodness doth bless

10
00:01:14,914 --> 00:01:21,214
and prosper those who put their trust in him.

11
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:24,589
2 Yea, and we may see at the very time

12
00:01:24,589 --> 00:01:27,964
when he doth prosper his people, yea, in the

13
00:01:27,964 --> 00:01:31,339
increase of their fields, their flocks and

14
00:01:31,339 --> 00:01:34,714
their herds, and in gold, and in silver,

15
00:01:34,714 --> 00:01:38,089
and in all manner of precious things of

16
00:01:38,089 --> 00:01:41,464
every kind and art; sparing their lives, and

17
00:01:41,464 --> 00:01:44,839
delivering them out of the hands of their

18
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:48,214
enemies; softening the hearts of their

19
00:01:48,214 --> 00:01:51,589
enemies that they should not declare wars

20
00:01:51,589 --> 00:01:54,964
against them; yea, and in fine, doing all

21
00:01:54,964 --> 00:01:58,339
things for the welfare and happiness of his

22
00:01:58,339 --> 00:02:01,714
people; yea, then is the time that they do

23
00:02:01,714 --> 00:02:05,089
harden their hearts, and do forget the

24
00:02:05,089 --> 00:02:08,464
Lord their God, and do trample under their

25
00:02:08,464 --> 00:02:11,839
feet the Holy One—yea, and this because of

26
00:02:11,839 --> 00:02:15,369
their ease, and their exceedingly great prosperity.

27
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:20,369
3 And thus we see that except the

28
00:02:20,369 --> 00:02:25,369
Lord doth chasten his people with many

29
00:02:25,369 --> 00:02:30,369
afflictions, yea, except he doth visit

30
00:02:30,369 --> 00:02:35,369
them with death and with terror, and

31
00:02:35,369 --> 00:02:40,369
with famine and with all manner of

32
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:45,599
pestilence, they will not remember him.

33
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,885
4 O how foolish, and how vain, and

34
00:02:46,885 --> 00:02:48,171
how evil, and devilish, and how quick

35
00:02:48,171 --> 00:02:49,457
to do iniquity, and how slow to do

36
00:02:49,457 --> 00:02:50,743
good, are the children of men; yea,

37
00:02:50,743 --> 00:02:52,029
how quick to hearken unto the words

38
00:02:52,029 --> 00:02:53,315
of the evil one, and to set their

39
00:02:53,315 --> 00:02:54,041
hearts upon the vain things of the world!

40
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:59,184
5 Yea, how quick to be lifted up

41
00:02:59,184 --> 00:03:04,327
in pride; yea, how quick to boast,

42
00:03:04,327 --> 00:03:09,47
and do all manner of that which is

43
00:03:09,47 --> 00:03:14,613
iniquity; and how slow are they

44
00:03:14,613 --> 00:03:19,756
to remember the Lord their God, and

45
00:03:19,756 --> 00:03:24,899
to give ear unto his counsels,

46
00:03:24,899 --> 00:03:30,343
yea, how slow to walk in wisdom’s paths!

47
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:35,218
6 Behold, they do not desire

48
00:03:35,218 --> 00:03:40,093
that the Lord their God, who hath

49
00:03:40,093 --> 00:03:44,968
created them, should rule and

50
00:03:44,968 --> 00:03:49,843
reign over them; notwithstanding

51
00:03:49,843 --> 00:03:54,718
his great goodness and his mercy

52
00:03:54,718 --> 00:03:59,593
towards them, they do set at

53
00:03:59,593 --> 00:04:04,468
naught his counsels, and they will

54
00:04:04,468 --> 00:04:09,75
not that he should be their guide.

55
00:04:09,75 --> 00:04:17,25
7 O how great is the

56
00:04:17,25 --> 00:04:24,75
nothingness of the children of

57
00:04:24,75 --> 00:04:32,25
men; yea, even they are less

58
00:04:32,25 --> 00:04:39,98
than the dust of the earth.

59
00:04:39,98 --> 00:04:45,813
8 For behold, the dust

60
00:04:45,813 --> 00:04:51,646
of the earth moveth

61
00:04:51,646 --> 00:04:57,479
hither and thither, to

62
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:03,312
the dividing asunder,

63
00:05:03,312 --> 00:05:09,145
at the command of our

64
00:05:09,145 --> 00:05:14,281
great and everlasting God.

65
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:17,531
9 Yea, behold at

66
00:05:17,531 --> 00:05:20,781
his voice do the

67
00:05:20,781 --> 00:05:24,031
hills and the mountains

68
00:05:24,031 --> 00:05:27,661
tremble and quake.

69
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,494
10 And by the

70
00:05:29,494 --> 00:05:31,327
power of his voice

71
00:05:31,327 --> 00:05:33,16
they are broken

72
00:05:33,16 --> 00:05:34,993
up, and become

73
00:05:34,993 --> 00:05:36,826
smooth, yea,

74
00:05:36,826 --> 00:05:38,038
even like unto a valley.

75
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:40,788
11 Yea, by the

76
00:05:40,788 --> 00:05:43,538
power of his

77
00:05:43,538 --> 00:05:46,288
voice doth the

78
00:05:46,288 --> 00:05:49,015
whole earth shake;

79
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,182
12 Yea, by the

80
00:05:50,182 --> 00:05:51,349
power of his

81
00:05:51,349 --> 00:05:52,516
voice, do the

82
00:05:52,516 --> 00:05:53,683
foundations

83
00:05:53,683 --> 00:05:54,85
rock, even to

84
00:05:54,85 --> 00:05:56,056
the very center.

85
00:05:56,056 --> 00:06:00,056
13 Yea, and

86
00:06:00,056 --> 00:06:04,056
if he say unto

87
00:06:04,056 --> 00:06:08,056
the

88
00:06:08,056 --> 00:06:12,005
earth—Move—it is moved.

89
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:13,116
14 Yea, if

90
00:06:13,116 --> 00:06:14,227
he say unto

91
00:06:14,227 --> 00:06:15,338
the

92
00:06:15,338 --> 00:06:16,449
earth—Thou shalt go

93
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:17,56
back, that it

94
00:06:17,56 --> 00:06:18,671
lengthen

95
00:06:18,671 --> 00:06:19,782
out the day

96
00:06:19,782 --> 00:06:20,893
for many

97
00:06:20,893 --> 00:06:22,382
hours—it is done;

98
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,323
15 And

99
00:06:23,323 --> 00:06:24,264
thus, according

100
00:06:24,264 --> 00:06:25,205
to his

101
00:06:25,205 --> 00:06:26,146
word the earth

102
00:06:26,146 --> 00:06:27,087
goeth

103
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:28,028
back, and it

104
00:06:28,028 --> 00:06:28,969
appeareth

105
00:06:28,969 --> 00:06:29,91
unto man that

106
00:06:29,91 --> 00:06:30,851
the sun

107
00:06:30,851 --> 00:06:31,792
standeth

108
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:32,733
still; yea, and

109
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:33,674
behold,

110
00:06:33,674 --> 00:06:34,615
this is so;

111
00:06:34,615 --> 00:06:35,556
for surely it

112
00:06:35,556 --> 00:06:36,497
is the

113
00:06:36,497 --> 00:06:37,438
earth that

114
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:38,331
moveth and not the sun.

115
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:38,664
16 And

116
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:38,997
behold, also,

117
00:06:38,997 --> 00:06:39,33
if he say

118
00:06:39,33 --> 00:06:39,663
unto the

119
00:06:39,663 --> 00:06:39,996
waters of

120
00:06:39,996 --> 00:06:40,329
the great

121
00:06:40,329 --> 00:06:40,662
deep—Be

122
00:06:40,662 --> 00:06:40,995
thou dried

123
00:06:40,995 --> 00:06:41,801
up—it is done.

124
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:41,944
17

125
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:42,087
Behold, if he

126
00:06:42,087 --> 00:06:42,23
say unto

127
00:06:42,23 --> 00:06:42,373
this

128
00:06:42,373 --> 00:06:42,516
mountain—Be

129
00:06:42,516 --> 00:06:42,659
thou raised

130
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:42,802
up, and

131
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:42,945
come over

132
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:43,088
and fall

133
00:06:43,088 --> 00:06:43,231
upon

134
00:06:43,231 --> 00:06:43,374
that city,

135
00:06:43,374 --> 00:06:43,517
that it be

136
00:06:43,517 --> 00:06:43,66
buried

137
00:06:43,66 --> 00:06:43,737
up—behold it is done.

138
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:43,787
18 And

139
00:06:43,787 --> 00:06:43,837
behold,

140
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:43,887
if a man

141
00:06:43,887 --> 00:06:43,937
hide up

142
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:43,987
a

143
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:44,037
treasure in

144
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:44,087
the earth,

145
00:06:44,087 --> 00:06:44,137
and the

146
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:44,187
Lord

147
00:06:44,187 --> 00:06:44,237
shall

148
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:44,287
say—Let it

149
00:06:44,287 --> 00:06:44,337
be

150
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:44,387
accursed,

151
00:06:44,387 --> 00:06:44,437
because of

152
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:44,487
the

153
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:44,537
iniquity of

154
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:44,587
him who

155
00:06:44,587 --> 00:06:44,637
hath hid

156
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:44,687
it

157
00:06:44,687 --> 00:06:44,204
up—behold, it shall be accursed.

158
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:45,061
19 And

159
00:06:45,061 --> 00:06:45,918
if the

160
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:46,775
Lord

161
00:06:46,775 --> 00:06:47,632
shall

162
00:06:47,632 --> 00:06:48,489
say—Be

163
00:06:48,489 --> 00:06:49,346
thou

164
00:06:49,346 --> 00:06:50,203
accursed,

165
00:06:50,203 --> 00:06:51,06
that no

166
00:06:51,06 --> 00:06:51,917
man

167
00:06:51,917 --> 00:06:52,774
shall find

168
00:06:52,774 --> 00:06:53,631
thee

169
00:06:53,631 --> 00:06:54,488
from this

170
00:06:54,488 --> 00:06:55,345
time

171
00:06:55,345 --> 00:06:56,202


172
00:06:56,202 --> 00:06:57,059
henceforth and

173
00:06:57,059 --> 00:06:57,916


174
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:58,773


175
00:06:58,773 --> 00:06:59,63
forever—behold, no

176
00:06:59,63 --> 00:07:00,487
man

177
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:01,344
getteth it

178
00:07:01,344 --> 00:07:02,088
henceforth and forever.

179
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,31
20 And

180
00:07:03,31 --> 00:07:04,532


181
00:07:04,532 --> 00:07:05,754
behold, if

182
00:07:05,754 --> 00:07:06,976
the

183
00:07:06,976 --> 00:07:08,198
Lord

184
00:07:08,198 --> 00:07:09,42
shall say

185
00:07:09,42 --> 00:07:10,642
unto

186
00:07:10,642 --> 00:07:11,864
a

187
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:13,086


188
00:07:13,086 --> 00:07:14,308
man—Because of

189
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:15,53
thine

190
00:07:15,53 --> 00:07:16,752


191
00:07:16,752 --> 00:07:17,974
iniquities,

192
00:07:17,974 --> 00:07:19,196
thou

193
00:07:19,196 --> 00:07:20,418
shalt be

194
00:07:20,418 --> 00:07:21,64


195
00:07:21,64 --> 00:07:22,862
accursed

196
00:07:22,862 --> 00:07:24,344
forever—it shall be done.

197
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:24,299
21

198
00:07:24,299 --> 00:07:24,254
And if

199
00:07:24,254 --> 00:07:24,209
the

200
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:24,164
