00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:28,6
Chapter 8 Corrupt judges seek to incite the people

2
00:00:28,6 --> 00:00:57,2
 against Nephi—Abraham, Moses, Zenos, Zenock,

3
00:00:57,2 --> 00:01:25,8
 Ezias, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lehi, and Nephi all testified

4
00:01:25,8 --> 00:01:54,4
 of Christ—By inspiration Nephi announces the

5
00:01:54,4 --> 00:02:23,0
 murder of the chief judge. About 23–21 B.C.

6
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:24,543
1 And now it came to pass that when Nephi had said

7
00:02:24,543 --> 00:02:25,543
 these words, behold, there were men who were

8
00:02:25,543 --> 00:02:26,543
 judges, who also belonged to the secret band of

9
00:02:26,543 --> 00:02:27,543
 Gadianton, and they were angry, and they cried out

10
00:02:27,543 --> 00:02:28,543
 against him, saying unto the people: Why do ye not

11
00:02:28,543 --> 00:02:29,543
 seize upon this man and bring him forth, that he may

12
00:02:29,543 --> 00:02:30,543
 be condemned according to the crime which he has

13
00:02:30,543 --> 00:02:31,543
 done

14
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:39,518
2 Why seest thou this man, and hearest him revile

15
00:02:39,518 --> 00:02:47,518
 against this people and against our law

16
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,067
3 For behold, Nephi had spoken unto them

17
00:02:49,067 --> 00:02:50,667
 concerning the corruptness of their law; yea, many things

18
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:52,267
 did Nephi speak which cannot be written; and

19
00:02:52,267 --> 00:02:53,867
 nothing did he speak which was contrary to the

20
00:02:53,867 --> 00:02:55,467
 commandments of God

21
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:55,442
4 And those judges were angry with him because he

22
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:55,442
 spake plainly unto them concerning their secret

23
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:55,442
 works of darkness; nevertheless, they durst not lay

24
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:55,442
 their own hands upon him, for they feared the

25
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:55,442
 people lest they should cry out against them

26
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:59,275
5 Therefore they did cry unto the people, saying:

27
00:02:59,275 --> 00:03:02,608
 Why do you suffer this man to revile against us?

28
00:03:02,608 --> 00:03:05,941
 For behold he doth condemn all this people, even

29
00:03:05,941 --> 00:03:09,274
 unto destruction; yea, and also that these our great

30
00:03:09,274 --> 00:03:12,607
 cities shall be taken from us, that we shall have

31
00:03:12,607 --> 00:03:15,94
 no place in them

32
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:23,996
6 And now we know that this is impossible, for

33
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:31,996
 behold, we are powerful, and our cities great,

34
00:03:31,996 --> 00:03:39,996
 therefore our enemies can have no power over us

35
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:57,186
7 And it came to pass that thus they did stir up

36
00:03:57,186 --> 00:04:14,519
 the people to anger against Nephi, and raised

37
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:31,852
 contentions among them; for there were some who did cry

38
00:04:31,852 --> 00:04:49,185
 out: Let this man alone, for he is a good man,

39
00:04:49,185 --> 00:05:06,518
 and those things which he saith will surely come to

40
00:05:06,518 --> 00:05:23,851
 pass except we repent

41
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:26,19
8 Yea, behold, all the judgments will come upon us

42
00:05:26,19 --> 00:05:28,857
 which he has testified unto us; for we know that

43
00:05:28,857 --> 00:05:31,524
 he has testified aright unto us concerning our

44
00:05:31,524 --> 00:05:34,191
 iniquities. And behold they are many, and he knoweth

45
00:05:34,191 --> 00:05:36,858
 as well all things which shall befall us as he

46
00:05:36,858 --> 00:05:39,525
 knoweth of our iniquities

47
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:55,472
9 Yea, and behold, if he had not been a prophet he

48
00:05:55,472 --> 00:06:11,472
 could not have testified concerning those things

49
00:06:11,472 --> 00:06:27,472


50
00:06:27,32 --> 00:06:29,987
10 And it came to pass that those people who

51
00:06:29,987 --> 00:06:32,654
 sought to destroy Nephi were compelled because of their

52
00:06:32,654 --> 00:06:35,321
 fear, that they did not lay their hands on him;

53
00:06:35,321 --> 00:06:37,988
 therefore he began again to speak unto them, seeing

54
00:06:37,988 --> 00:06:40,655
 that he had gained favor in the eyes of some,

55
00:06:40,655 --> 00:06:43,322
 insomuch that the remainder of them did fear

56
00:06:43,27 --> 00:06:43,27
11 Therefore he was constrained to speak more unto

57
00:06:43,27 --> 00:06:43,27
 them saying: Behold, my brethren, have ye not

58
00:06:43,27 --> 00:06:43,27
 read that God gave power unto one man, even Moses, to

59
00:06:43,27 --> 00:06:43,27
 smite upon the waters of the Red Sea, and they

60
00:06:43,27 --> 00:06:43,27
 parted hither and thither, insomuch that the

61
00:06:43,27 --> 00:06:43,27
 Israelites, who were our fathers, came through upon dry

62
00:06:43,27 --> 00:06:43,27
 ground, and the waters closed upon the armies of

63
00:06:43,27 --> 00:06:43,27
 the Egyptians and swallowed them up

64
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,737
12 And now behold, if God gave unto this man such

65
00:06:45,737 --> 00:06:47,737
 power, then why should ye dispute among

66
00:06:47,737 --> 00:06:49,737
 yourselves, and say that he hath given unto me no power

67
00:06:49,737 --> 00:06:51,737
 whereby I may know concerning the judgments that shall

68
00:06:51,737 --> 00:06:53,737
 come upon you except ye repent

69
00:06:53,38 --> 00:06:59,88
13 But, behold, ye not only deny my words, but ye

70
00:06:59,88 --> 00:07:06,38
 also deny all the words which have been spoken by

71
00:07:06,38 --> 00:07:12,88
 our fathers, and also the words which were spoken

72
00:07:12,88 --> 00:07:19,38
 by this man, Moses, who had such great power given

73
00:07:19,38 --> 00:07:25,88
 unto him, yea, the words which he hath spoken

74
00:07:25,88 --> 00:07:32,38
 concerning the coming of the Messiah

75
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:38,802
14 Yea, did he not bear record that the Son of God

76
00:07:38,802 --> 00:07:45,552
 should come? And as he lifted up the brazen

77
00:07:45,552 --> 00:07:52,302
 serpent in the wilderness, even so shall he be lifted

78
00:07:52,302 --> 00:07:59,052
 up who should come

79
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:05,029
15 And as many as should look upon that serpent

80
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:10,779
 should live, even so as many as should look upon the

81
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:16,529
 Son of God with faith, having a contrite spirit,

82
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:22,279
 might live, even unto that life which is eternal

83
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:29,636
16 And now behold, Moses did not only testify of

84
00:08:29,636 --> 00:08:36,303
 these things, but also all the holy prophets, from

85
00:08:36,303 --> 00:08:42,97
 his days even to the days of Abraham

86
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:49,755
17 Yea, and behold, Abraham saw of his coming, and

87
00:08:49,755 --> 00:08:57,255
 was filled with gladness and did rejoice

88
00:08:57,27 --> 00:09:03,27
18 Yea, and behold I say unto you, that Abraham

89
00:09:03,27 --> 00:09:09,27
 not only knew of these things, but there were many

90
00:09:09,27 --> 00:09:15,27
 before the days of Abraham who were called by the

91
00:09:15,27 --> 00:09:21,27
 order of God; yea, even after the order of his Son;

92
00:09:21,27 --> 00:09:27,27
 and this that it should be shown unto the people,

93
00:09:27,27 --> 00:09:33,27
 a great many thousand years before his coming,

94
00:09:33,27 --> 00:09:39,27
 that even redemption should come unto them

95
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:45,846
19 And now I would that ye should know, that even

96
00:09:45,846 --> 00:09:52,046
 since the days of Abraham there have been many

97
00:09:52,046 --> 00:09:58,246
 prophets that have testified these things; yea,

98
00:09:58,246 --> 00:10:04,446
 behold, the prophet Zenos did testify boldly; for the

99
00:10:04,446 --> 00:10:10,646
 which he was slain

100
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:17,476
20 And behold, also Zenock, and also Ezias, and

101
00:10:17,476 --> 00:10:24,809
 also Isaiah, and Jeremiah, (Jeremiah being that same

102
00:10:24,809 --> 00:10:32,142
 prophet who testified of the destruction of

103
00:10:32,142 --> 00:10:39,475
 Jerusalem) and now we know that Jerusalem was destroyed

104
00:10:39,475 --> 00:10:46,808
 according to the words of Jeremiah. O then why

105
00:10:46,808 --> 00:10:54,141
 not the Son of God come, according to his prophecy

106
00:10:54,387 --> 00:11:01,72
21 And now will you dispute that Jerusalem was

107
00:11:01,72 --> 00:11:09,053
 destroyed? Will ye say that the sons of Zedekiah were

108
00:11:09,053 --> 00:11:16,386
 not slain, all except it were Mulek? Yea, and do

109
00:11:16,386 --> 00:11:23,719
 ye not behold that the seed of Zedekiah are with

110
00:11:23,719 --> 00:11:31,052
 us, and they were driven out of the land of

111
00:11:31,052 --> 00:11:38,385
 Jerusalem? But behold, this is not all

112
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:44,679
22 Our father Lehi was driven out of Jerusalem

113
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:50,393
 because he testified of these things. Nephi also

114
00:11:50,393 --> 00:11:56,107
 testified of these things, and also almost all of our

115
00:11:56,107 --> 00:12:01,821
 fathers, even down to this time; yea, they have

116
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:07,535
 testified of the coming of Christ, and have looked

117
00:12:07,535 --> 00:12:13,249
 forward, and have rejoiced in his day which is to

118
00:12:13,249 --> 00:12:18,963
 come

119
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:24,804
23 And behold, he is God, and he is with them, and

120
00:12:24,804 --> 00:12:31,304
 he did manifest himself unto them, that they were

121
00:12:31,304 --> 00:12:37,804
 redeemed by him; and they gave unto him glory,

122
00:12:37,804 --> 00:12:44,304
 because of that which is to come

123
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:52,007
24 And now, seeing ye know these things and cannot

124
00:12:52,007 --> 00:12:59,15
 deny them except ye shall lie, therefore in this

125
00:12:59,15 --> 00:13:06,293
 ye have sinned, for ye have rejected all these

126
00:13:06,293 --> 00:13:13,436
 things, notwithstanding so many evidences which ye

127
00:13:13,436 --> 00:13:20,579
 have received; yea, even ye have received all

128
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:27,722
 things, both things in heaven, and all things which are

129
00:13:27,722 --> 00:13:34,865
 in the earth, as a witness that they are true

130
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:40,814
25 But behold, ye have rejected the truth, and

131
00:13:40,814 --> 00:13:47,314
 rebelled against your holy God; and even at this

132
00:13:47,314 --> 00:13:53,814
 time, instead of laying up for yourselves treasures in

133
00:13:53,814 --> 00:14:00,314
 heaven, where nothing doth corrupt, and where

134
00:14:00,314 --> 00:14:06,814
 nothing can come which is unclean, ye are heaping up

135
00:14:06,814 --> 00:14:13,314
 for yourselves wrath against the day of judgment

136
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:20,219
26 Yea, even at this time ye are ripening, because

137
00:14:20,219 --> 00:14:27,219
 of your murders and your fornication and

138
00:14:27,219 --> 00:14:34,219
 wickedness, for everlasting destruction; yea, and except

139
00:14:34,219 --> 00:14:41,219
 ye repent it will come unto you soon

140
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:48,347
27 Yea, behold it is now even at your doors; yea,

141
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:55,547
 go ye in unto the judgment-seat, and search; and

142
00:14:55,547 --> 00:15:02,747
 behold, your judge is murdered, and he lieth in his

143
00:15:02,747 --> 00:15:09,947
 blood; and he hath been murdered by his brother,

144
00:15:09,947 --> 00:15:17,147
 who seeketh to sit in the judgment-seat

145
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,75
28 And behold, they both belong to your secret

146
00:15:18,75 --> 00:15:20,417
 band, whose author is Gadianton and the evil one who

147
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:22,084
 seeketh to destroy the souls of men.
