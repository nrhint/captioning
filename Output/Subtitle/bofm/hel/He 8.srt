00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 8 Corrupt judges seek to incite the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
people against Nephi—Abraham, Moses, Zenos, Zenock,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Ezias, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lehi, and Nephi all

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
testified of Christ—By inspiration Nephi announces

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:06:11,
the murder of the chief judge. About 23–21 B.C. 

6
00:06:11,0 --> 00:06:11,0
1 And now it came to pass that when Nephi

7
00:06:11,0 --> 00:06:11,0
had said these words, behold, there were men

8
00:06:11,0 --> 00:06:11,0
who were judges, who also belonged to the

9
00:06:11,0 --> 00:06:11,0
secret band of Gadianton, and they were angry,

10
00:06:11,0 --> 00:06:11,0
and they cried out against him, saying unto

11
00:06:11,0 --> 00:06:11,0
the people: Why do ye not seize upon this

12
00:06:11,0 --> 00:06:11,0
man and bring him forth, that he may be

13
00:06:11,0 --> 00:08:23,
condemned according to the crime which he has done?

14
00:08:23,0 --> 00:08:23,0
2 Why seest thou this man, and

15
00:08:23,0 --> 00:08:23,0
hearest him revile against

16
00:08:23,0 --> 00:13:33,
this people and against our law?

17
00:13:33,0 --> 00:13:33,0
3 For behold, Nephi had

18
00:13:33,0 --> 00:13:33,0
spoken unto them concerning

19
00:13:33,0 --> 00:13:33,0
the corruptness of their

20
00:13:33,0 --> 00:13:33,0
law; yea, many things did

21
00:13:33,0 --> 00:13:33,0
Nephi speak which cannot be

22
00:13:33,0 --> 00:13:33,0
written; and nothing did

23
00:13:33,0 --> 00:13:33,0
he speak which was

24
00:13:33,0 --> 00:17:03,
contrary to the commandments of God.

25
00:17:03,0 --> 00:17:03,0
4 And those judges were

26
00:17:03,0 --> 00:17:03,0
angry with him because

27
00:17:03,0 --> 00:17:03,0
he spake plainly unto

28
00:17:03,0 --> 00:17:03,0
them concerning their

29
00:17:03,0 --> 00:17:03,0
secret works of darkness;

30
00:17:03,0 --> 00:17:03,0
nevertheless, they durst

31
00:17:03,0 --> 00:17:03,0
not lay their own hands

32
00:17:03,0 --> 00:17:03,0
upon him, for they feared

33
00:17:03,0 --> 00:17:03,0
the people lest they

34
00:17:03,0 --> 00:16:35,
should cry out against them.

35
00:16:35,0 --> 00:16:35,0
5 Therefore they did

36
00:16:35,0 --> 00:16:35,0
cry unto the people,

37
00:16:35,0 --> 00:16:35,0
saying: Why do you

38
00:16:35,0 --> 00:16:35,0
suffer this man to revile

39
00:16:35,0 --> 00:16:35,0
against us? For behold

40
00:16:35,0 --> 00:16:35,0
he doth condemn all

41
00:16:35,0 --> 00:16:35,0
this people, even unto

42
00:16:35,0 --> 00:16:35,0
destruction; yea, and

43
00:16:35,0 --> 00:16:35,0
also that these our

44
00:16:35,0 --> 00:16:35,0
great cities shall be

45
00:16:35,0 --> 00:16:35,0
taken from us, that we

46
00:16:35,0 --> 00:20:05,
shall have no place in them.

47
00:20:05,0 --> 00:20:05,0
6 And now we know

48
00:20:05,0 --> 00:20:05,0
that this is

49
00:20:05,0 --> 00:20:05,0
impossible, for behold, we

50
00:20:05,0 --> 00:20:05,0
are powerful, and our

51
00:20:05,0 --> 00:20:05,0
cities great,

52
00:20:05,0 --> 00:20:05,0
therefore our enemies can

53
00:20:05,0 --> 00:19:51,
have no power over us.

54
00:19:51,0 --> 00:19:51,0
7 And it came to

55
00:19:51,0 --> 00:19:51,0
pass that thus they

56
00:19:51,0 --> 00:19:51,0
did stir up the

57
00:19:51,0 --> 00:19:51,0
people to anger against

58
00:19:51,0 --> 00:19:51,0
Nephi, and raised

59
00:19:51,0 --> 00:19:51,0
contentions among

60
00:19:51,0 --> 00:19:51,0
them; for there were

61
00:19:51,0 --> 00:19:51,0
some who did cry

62
00:19:51,0 --> 00:19:51,0
out: Let this man

63
00:19:51,0 --> 00:19:51,0
alone, for he is a

64
00:19:51,0 --> 00:19:51,0
good man, and those

65
00:19:51,0 --> 00:19:51,0
things which he

66
00:19:51,0 --> 00:19:51,0
saith will surely come

67
00:19:51,0 --> 00:19:37,
to pass except we repent;

68
00:19:37,0 --> 00:19:37,0
8 Yea, behold, all

69
00:19:37,0 --> 00:19:37,0
the judgments

70
00:19:37,0 --> 00:19:37,0
will come upon us

71
00:19:37,0 --> 00:19:37,0
which he has

72
00:19:37,0 --> 00:19:37,0
testified unto us; for we

73
00:19:37,0 --> 00:19:37,0
know that he has

74
00:19:37,0 --> 00:19:37,0
testified aright

75
00:19:37,0 --> 00:19:37,0
unto us concerning

76
00:19:37,0 --> 00:19:37,0
our iniquities. And

77
00:19:37,0 --> 00:19:37,0
behold they are

78
00:19:37,0 --> 00:19:37,0
many, and he

79
00:19:37,0 --> 00:19:37,0
knoweth as well all

80
00:19:37,0 --> 00:19:37,0
things which shall

81
00:19:37,0 --> 00:19:37,0
befall us as he

82
00:19:37,0 --> 00:21:49,
knoweth of our iniquities;

83
00:21:49,0 --> 00:21:49,0
9 Yea, and

84
00:21:49,0 --> 00:21:49,0
behold, if he had not

85
00:21:49,0 --> 00:21:49,0
been a prophet

86
00:21:49,0 --> 00:21:49,0
he could not

87
00:21:49,0 --> 00:21:49,0
have testified

88
00:21:49,0 --> 00:24:59,
concerning those things.

89
00:24:59,0 --> 00:24:59,0
10 And it came

90
00:24:59,0 --> 00:24:59,0
to pass that

91
00:24:59,0 --> 00:24:59,0
those people who

92
00:24:59,0 --> 00:24:59,0
sought to

93
00:24:59,0 --> 00:24:59,0
destroy Nephi were

94
00:24:59,0 --> 00:24:59,0
compelled

95
00:24:59,0 --> 00:24:59,0
because of their

96
00:24:59,0 --> 00:24:59,0
fear, that they did

97
00:24:59,0 --> 00:24:59,0
not lay their

98
00:24:59,0 --> 00:24:59,0
hands on him;

99
00:24:59,0 --> 00:24:59,0
therefore he

100
00:24:59,0 --> 00:24:59,0
began again to

101
00:24:59,0 --> 00:24:59,0
speak unto them,

102
00:24:59,0 --> 00:24:59,0
seeing that he

103
00:24:59,0 --> 00:24:59,0
had gained favor

104
00:24:59,0 --> 00:24:59,0
in the eyes of

105
00:24:59,0 --> 00:24:59,0
some, insomuch

106
00:24:59,0 --> 00:24:59,0
that the

107
00:24:59,0 --> 00:24:31,
remainder of them did fear.

108
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
11 Therefore

109
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
he was

110
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
constrained to speak

111
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
more unto them

112
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
saying:

113
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
Behold, my brethren,

114
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
have ye not

115
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
read that God

116
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
gave power unto

117
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
one man, even

118
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
Moses, to

119
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
smite upon the

120
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
waters of the

121
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
Red Sea, and

122
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
they parted

123
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
hither and thither,

124
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
insomuch that

125
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
the

126
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
Israelites, who were

127
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
our fathers,

128
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
came through upon

129
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
dry ground,

130
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
and the waters

131
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
closed upon

132
00:24:31,0 --> 00:24:31,0
the armies of

133
00:24:31,0 --> 00:28:01,
the Egyptians and swallowed them up?

134
00:28:01,0 --> 00:28:01,0
12 And now

135
00:28:01,0 --> 00:28:01,0
behold, if God

136
00:28:01,0 --> 00:28:01,0
gave unto

137
00:28:01,0 --> 00:28:01,0
this man such

138
00:28:01,0 --> 00:28:01,0
power, then why

139
00:28:01,0 --> 00:28:01,0
should ye

140
00:28:01,0 --> 00:28:01,0
dispute among

141
00:28:01,0 --> 00:28:01,0
yourselves,

142
00:28:01,0 --> 00:28:01,0
and say that he

143
00:28:01,0 --> 00:28:01,0
hath given

144
00:28:01,0 --> 00:28:01,0
unto me no

145
00:28:01,0 --> 00:28:01,0
power whereby I

146
00:28:01,0 --> 00:28:01,0
may know

147
00:28:01,0 --> 00:28:01,0
concerning the

148
00:28:01,0 --> 00:28:01,0
judgments that

149
00:28:01,0 --> 00:28:01,0
shall come

150
00:28:01,0 --> 00:27:33,
upon you except ye repent?

151
00:27:33,0 --> 00:27:33,0
13 But,

152
00:27:33,0 --> 00:27:33,0
behold, ye not

153
00:27:33,0 --> 00:27:33,0
only deny my

154
00:27:33,0 --> 00:27:33,0
words, but

155
00:27:33,0 --> 00:27:33,0
ye also deny

156
00:27:33,0 --> 00:27:33,0
all the

157
00:27:33,0 --> 00:27:33,0
words which have

158
00:27:33,0 --> 00:27:33,0
been spoken

159
00:27:33,0 --> 00:27:33,0
by our

160
00:27:33,0 --> 00:27:33,0
fathers, and

161
00:27:33,0 --> 00:27:33,0
also the words

162
00:27:33,0 --> 00:27:33,0
which were

163
00:27:33,0 --> 00:27:33,0
spoken by

164
00:27:33,0 --> 00:27:33,0
this man,

165
00:27:33,0 --> 00:27:33,0
Moses, who had

166
00:27:33,0 --> 00:27:33,0
such great

167
00:27:33,0 --> 00:27:33,0
power given

168
00:27:33,0 --> 00:27:33,0
unto him, yea,

169
00:27:33,0 --> 00:27:33,0
the words

170
00:27:33,0 --> 00:27:33,0
which he hath

171
00:27:33,0 --> 00:27:33,0
spoken

172
00:27:33,0 --> 00:29:45,
concerning the coming of the Messiah.

173
00:29:45,0 --> 00:29:45,0
14 Yea, did

174
00:29:45,0 --> 00:29:45,0
he not bear

175
00:29:45,0 --> 00:29:45,0
record that

176
00:29:45,0 --> 00:29:45,0
the Son of

177
00:29:45,0 --> 00:29:45,0
God should

178
00:29:45,0 --> 00:29:45,0
come? And as

179
00:29:45,0 --> 00:29:45,0
he lifted up

180
00:29:45,0 --> 00:29:45,0
the brazen

181
00:29:45,0 --> 00:29:45,0
serpent in

182
00:29:45,0 --> 00:29:45,0
the

183
00:29:45,0 --> 00:29:45,0
wilderness, even so

184
00:29:45,0 --> 00:29:45,0
shall he be

185
00:29:45,0 --> 00:29:45,0
lifted up who

186
00:29:45,0 --> 00:29:17,
should come.

187
00:29:17,0 --> 00:29:17,0
15 And as

188
00:29:17,0 --> 00:29:17,0
many as

189
00:29:17,0 --> 00:29:17,0
should look

190
00:29:17,0 --> 00:29:17,0
upon that

191
00:29:17,0 --> 00:29:17,0
serpent should

192
00:29:17,0 --> 00:29:17,0
live, even

193
00:29:17,0 --> 00:29:17,0
so as many

194
00:29:17,0 --> 00:29:17,0
as should

195
00:29:17,0 --> 00:29:17,0
look upon

196
00:29:17,0 --> 00:29:17,0
the Son of

197
00:29:17,0 --> 00:29:17,0
God with

198
00:29:17,0 --> 00:29:17,0
faith, having a

199
00:29:17,0 --> 00:29:17,0
contrite

200
00:29:17,0 --> 00:29:17,0
spirit,

201
00:29:17,0 --> 00:29:17,0
might live,

202
00:29:17,0 --> 00:29:17,0
even unto that

203
00:29:17,0 --> 00:32:13,
life which is eternal.

204
00:32:13,0 --> 00:32:13,0
16 And now

205
00:32:13,0 --> 00:32:13,0
behold,

206
00:32:13,0 --> 00:32:13,0
Moses did

207
00:32:13,0 --> 00:32:13,0
not only

208
00:32:13,0 --> 00:32:13,0
testify of

209
00:32:13,0 --> 00:32:13,0
these

210
00:32:13,0 --> 00:32:13,0
things, but

211
00:32:13,0 --> 00:32:13,0
also all the

212
00:32:13,0 --> 00:32:13,0
holy

213
00:32:13,0 --> 00:32:13,0
prophets, from

214
00:32:13,0 --> 00:32:13,0
his days

215
00:32:13,0 --> 00:32:13,0
even to the

216
00:32:13,0 --> 00:33:25,
days of Abraham.

217
00:33:25,0 --> 00:33:25,0
17 Yea,

218
00:33:25,0 --> 00:33:25,0
and

219
00:33:25,0 --> 00:33:25,0
behold, Abraham

220
00:33:25,0 --> 00:33:25,0
saw of

221
00:33:25,0 --> 00:33:25,0
his

222
00:33:25,0 --> 00:33:25,0
coming, and was

223
00:33:25,0 --> 00:33:25,0
filled

224
00:33:25,0 --> 00:33:25,0
