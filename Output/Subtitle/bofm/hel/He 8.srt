00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:09,2
Chapter 8 Corrupt judges seek to incite the

2
00:00:09,2 --> 00:00:18,4
people against Nephi—Abraham, Moses, Zenos, Zenock,

3
00:00:18,4 --> 00:00:27,6
Ezias, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lehi, and Nephi all

4
00:00:27,6 --> 00:00:36,8
testified of Christ—By inspiration Nephi announces

5
00:00:36,8 --> 00:00:46,914
the murder of the chief judge. About 23–21 B.C. 

6
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:46,789
1 And now it came to pass that when Nephi

7
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:46,664
had said these words, behold, there were men

8
00:00:46,664 --> 00:00:46,539
who were judges, who also belonged to the

9
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:46,414
secret band of Gadianton, and they were angry,

10
00:00:46,414 --> 00:00:46,289
and they cried out against him, saying unto

11
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:46,164
the people: Why do ye not seize upon this

12
00:00:46,164 --> 00:00:46,039
man and bring him forth, that he may be

13
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:45,979
condemned according to the crime which he has done?

14
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:46,979
2 Why seest thou this man, and

15
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:47,979
hearest him revile against

16
00:00:47,979 --> 00:00:48,382
this people and against our law?

17
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:53,257
3 For behold, Nephi had

18
00:00:53,257 --> 00:00:58,132
spoken unto them concerning

19
00:00:58,132 --> 00:01:03,007
the corruptness of their

20
00:01:03,007 --> 00:01:07,882
law; yea, many things did

21
00:01:07,882 --> 00:01:12,757
Nephi speak which cannot be

22
00:01:12,757 --> 00:01:17,632
written; and nothing did

23
00:01:17,632 --> 00:01:22,507
he speak which was

24
00:01:22,507 --> 00:01:27,321
contrary to the commandments of God.

25
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:28,821
4 And those judges were

26
00:01:28,821 --> 00:01:30,321
angry with him because

27
00:01:30,321 --> 00:01:31,821
he spake plainly unto

28
00:01:31,821 --> 00:01:33,321
them concerning their

29
00:01:33,321 --> 00:01:34,821
secret works of darkness;

30
00:01:34,821 --> 00:01:36,321
nevertheless, they durst

31
00:01:36,321 --> 00:01:37,821
not lay their own hands

32
00:01:37,821 --> 00:01:39,321
upon him, for they feared

33
00:01:39,321 --> 00:01:40,821
the people lest they

34
00:01:40,821 --> 00:01:42,336
should cry out against them.

35
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:44,169
5 Therefore they did

36
00:01:44,169 --> 00:01:46,002
cry unto the people,

37
00:01:46,002 --> 00:01:47,835
saying: Why do you

38
00:01:47,835 --> 00:01:49,668
suffer this man to revile

39
00:01:49,668 --> 00:01:51,501
against us? For behold

40
00:01:51,501 --> 00:01:53,334
he doth condemn all

41
00:01:53,334 --> 00:01:55,167
this people, even unto

42
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:56,0
destruction; yea, and

43
00:01:56,0 --> 00:01:58,833
also that these our

44
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:00,666
great cities shall be

45
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:02,499
taken from us, that we

46
00:02:02,499 --> 00:02:04,591
shall have no place in them.

47
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:08,734
6 And now we know

48
00:02:08,734 --> 00:02:12,877
that this is

49
00:02:12,877 --> 00:02:17,02
impossible, for behold, we

50
00:02:17,02 --> 00:02:21,163
are powerful, and our

51
00:02:21,163 --> 00:02:25,306
cities great,

52
00:02:25,306 --> 00:02:29,449
therefore our enemies can

53
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:33,92
have no power over us.

54
00:02:33,92 --> 00:02:36,706
7 And it came to

55
00:02:36,706 --> 00:02:39,492
pass that thus they

56
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,278
did stir up the

57
00:02:42,278 --> 00:02:45,064
people to anger against

58
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:47,85
Nephi, and raised

59
00:02:47,85 --> 00:02:50,636
contentions among

60
00:02:50,636 --> 00:02:53,422
them; for there were

61
00:02:53,422 --> 00:02:56,208
some who did cry

62
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,994
out: Let this man

63
00:02:58,994 --> 00:03:01,78
alone, for he is a

64
00:03:01,78 --> 00:03:04,566
good man, and those

65
00:03:04,566 --> 00:03:07,352
things which he

66
00:03:07,352 --> 00:03:10,138
saith will surely come

67
00:03:10,138 --> 00:03:12,859
to pass except we repent;

68
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,659
8 Yea, behold, all

69
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:16,459
the judgments

70
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:18,259
will come upon us

71
00:03:18,259 --> 00:03:20,059
which he has

72
00:03:20,059 --> 00:03:21,859
testified unto us; for we

73
00:03:21,859 --> 00:03:23,659
know that he has

74
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:25,459
testified aright

75
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:27,259
unto us concerning

76
00:03:27,259 --> 00:03:29,059
our iniquities. And

77
00:03:29,059 --> 00:03:30,859
behold they are

78
00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:32,659
many, and he

79
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:34,459
knoweth as well all

80
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:36,259
things which shall

81
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:38,059
befall us as he

82
00:03:38,059 --> 00:03:39,152
knoweth of our iniquities;

83
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:40,819
9 Yea, and

84
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:42,486
behold, if he had not

85
00:03:42,486 --> 00:03:44,153
been a prophet

86
00:03:44,153 --> 00:03:45,82
he could not

87
00:03:45,82 --> 00:03:47,487
have testified

88
00:03:47,487 --> 00:03:49,496
concerning those things.

89
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:50,707
10 And it came

90
00:03:50,707 --> 00:03:51,918
to pass that

91
00:03:51,918 --> 00:03:53,129
those people who

92
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:54,34
sought to

93
00:03:54,34 --> 00:03:55,551
destroy Nephi were

94
00:03:55,551 --> 00:03:56,762
compelled

95
00:03:56,762 --> 00:03:57,973
because of their

96
00:03:57,973 --> 00:03:59,184
fear, that they did

97
00:03:59,184 --> 00:04:00,395
not lay their

98
00:04:00,395 --> 00:04:01,606
hands on him;

99
00:04:01,606 --> 00:04:02,817
therefore he

100
00:04:02,817 --> 00:04:04,028
began again to

101
00:04:04,028 --> 00:04:05,239
speak unto them,

102
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:06,45
seeing that he

103
00:04:06,45 --> 00:04:07,661
had gained favor

104
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:08,872
in the eyes of

105
00:04:08,872 --> 00:04:10,083
some, insomuch

106
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,294
that the

107
00:04:11,294 --> 00:04:12,486
remainder of them did fear.

108
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:13,601
11 Therefore

109
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:14,716
he was

110
00:04:14,716 --> 00:04:15,831
constrained to speak

111
00:04:15,831 --> 00:04:16,946
more unto them

112
00:04:16,946 --> 00:04:18,061
saying:

113
00:04:18,061 --> 00:04:19,176
Behold, my brethren,

114
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,291
have ye not

115
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:21,406
read that God

116
00:04:21,406 --> 00:04:22,521
gave power unto

117
00:04:22,521 --> 00:04:23,636
one man, even

118
00:04:23,636 --> 00:04:24,751
Moses, to

119
00:04:24,751 --> 00:04:25,866
smite upon the

120
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:26,981
waters of the

121
00:04:26,981 --> 00:04:28,096
Red Sea, and

122
00:04:28,096 --> 00:04:29,211
they parted

123
00:04:29,211 --> 00:04:30,326
hither and thither,

124
00:04:30,326 --> 00:04:31,441
insomuch that

125
00:04:31,441 --> 00:04:32,556
the

126
00:04:32,556 --> 00:04:33,671
Israelites, who were

127
00:04:33,671 --> 00:04:34,786
our fathers,

128
00:04:34,786 --> 00:04:35,901
came through upon

129
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,016
dry ground,

130
00:04:37,016 --> 00:04:38,131
and the waters

131
00:04:38,131 --> 00:04:39,246
closed upon

132
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:40,361
the armies of

133
00:04:40,361 --> 00:04:41,815
the Egyptians and swallowed them up?

134
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:41,756
12 And now

135
00:04:41,756 --> 00:04:41,697
behold, if God

136
00:04:41,697 --> 00:04:41,638
gave unto

137
00:04:41,638 --> 00:04:41,579
this man such

138
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:41,52
power, then why

139
00:04:41,52 --> 00:04:41,461
should ye

140
00:04:41,461 --> 00:04:41,402
dispute among

141
00:04:41,402 --> 00:04:41,343
yourselves,

142
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:41,284
and say that he

143
00:04:41,284 --> 00:04:41,225
hath given

144
00:04:41,225 --> 00:04:41,166
unto me no

145
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:41,107
power whereby I

146
00:04:41,107 --> 00:04:41,048
may know

147
00:04:41,048 --> 00:04:40,989
concerning the

148
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:40,93
judgments that

149
00:04:40,93 --> 00:04:40,871
shall come

150
00:04:40,871 --> 00:04:40,881
upon you except ye repent?

151
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:41,017
13 But,

152
00:04:41,017 --> 00:04:41,153
behold, ye not

153
00:04:41,153 --> 00:04:41,289
only deny my

154
00:04:41,289 --> 00:04:41,425
words, but

155
00:04:41,425 --> 00:04:41,561
ye also deny

156
00:04:41,561 --> 00:04:41,697
all the

157
00:04:41,697 --> 00:04:41,833
words which have

158
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:41,969
been spoken

159
00:04:41,969 --> 00:04:42,105
by our

160
00:04:42,105 --> 00:04:42,241
fathers, and

161
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:42,377
also the words

162
00:04:42,377 --> 00:04:42,513
which were

163
00:04:42,513 --> 00:04:42,649
spoken by

164
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:42,785
this man,

165
00:04:42,785 --> 00:04:42,921
Moses, who had

166
00:04:42,921 --> 00:04:43,057
such great

167
00:04:43,057 --> 00:04:43,193
power given

168
00:04:43,193 --> 00:04:43,329
unto him, yea,

169
00:04:43,329 --> 00:04:43,465
the words

170
00:04:43,465 --> 00:04:43,601
which he hath

171
00:04:43,601 --> 00:04:43,737
spoken

172
00:04:43,737 --> 00:04:43,283
concerning the coming of the Messiah.

173
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,14
14 Yea, did

174
00:04:44,14 --> 00:04:44,997
he not bear

175
00:04:44,997 --> 00:04:45,854
record that

176
00:04:45,854 --> 00:04:46,711
the Son of

177
00:04:46,711 --> 00:04:47,568
God should

178
00:04:47,568 --> 00:04:48,425
come? And as

179
00:04:48,425 --> 00:04:49,282
he lifted up

180
00:04:49,282 --> 00:04:50,139
the brazen

181
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:50,996
serpent in

182
00:04:50,996 --> 00:04:51,853
the

183
00:04:51,853 --> 00:04:52,71
wilderness, even so

184
00:04:52,71 --> 00:04:53,567
shall he be

185
00:04:53,567 --> 00:04:54,424
lifted up who

186
00:04:54,424 --> 00:04:55,662
should come.

187
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:56,427
15 And as

188
00:04:56,427 --> 00:04:57,192
many as

189
00:04:57,192 --> 00:04:57,957
should look

190
00:04:57,957 --> 00:04:58,722
upon that

191
00:04:58,722 --> 00:04:59,487
serpent should

192
00:04:59,487 --> 00:05:00,252
live, even

193
00:05:00,252 --> 00:05:01,017
so as many

194
00:05:01,017 --> 00:05:01,782
as should

195
00:05:01,782 --> 00:05:02,547
look upon

196
00:05:02,547 --> 00:05:03,312
the Son of

197
00:05:03,312 --> 00:05:04,077
God with

198
00:05:04,077 --> 00:05:04,842
faith, having a

199
00:05:04,842 --> 00:05:05,607
contrite

200
00:05:05,607 --> 00:05:06,372
spirit,

201
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:07,137
might live,

202
00:05:07,137 --> 00:05:07,902
