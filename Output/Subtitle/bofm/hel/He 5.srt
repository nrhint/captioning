00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:07,556
Chapter 5 Nephi and Lehi devote themselves to

2
00:00:07,556 --> 00:00:15,112
 preaching—Their names invite them to pattern their

3
00:00:15,112 --> 00:00:22,668
 lives after their forebears—Christ redeems those who

4
00:00:22,668 --> 00:00:30,224
 repent—Nephi and Lehi make many converts and are

5
00:00:30,224 --> 00:00:37,78
 imprisoned, and fire encircles them—A cloud of

6
00:00:37,78 --> 00:00:45,336
 darkness overshadows three hundred people—The earth

7
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:52,892
 shakes, and a voice commands men to repent—Nephi and

8
00:00:52,892 --> 00:01:00,448
 Lehi converse with angels, and the multitude is

9
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:08,004
 encircled by fire. About 30 B.C.

10
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:13,735
1 And it came to pass that in this same year,

11
00:01:13,735 --> 00:01:18,735
 behold, Nephi delivered up the judgment-seat to a man

12
00:01:18,735 --> 00:01:23,735
 whose name was Cezoram

13
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:54,384
2 For as their laws and their governments were

14
00:01:54,384 --> 00:02:24,784
 established by the voice of the people, and they who

15
00:02:24,784 --> 00:02:55,184
 chose evil were more numerous than they who chose

16
00:02:55,184 --> 00:03:25,584
 good, therefore they were ripening for

17
00:03:25,584 --> 00:03:55,984
 destruction, for the laws had become corrupted

18
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:57,502
3 Yea, and this was not all; they were a

19
00:03:57,502 --> 00:03:59,502
 stiffnecked people, insomuch that they could not be

20
00:03:59,502 --> 00:04:01,502
 governed by the law nor justice, save it were to their

21
00:04:01,502 --> 00:04:03,502
 destruction

22
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:17,877
4 And it came to pass that Nephi had become weary

23
00:04:17,877 --> 00:04:32,277
 because of their iniquity; and he yielded up the

24
00:04:32,277 --> 00:04:46,677
 judgment-seat, and took it upon him to preach the

25
00:04:46,677 --> 00:05:01,077
 word of God all the remainder of his days, and his

26
00:05:01,077 --> 00:05:15,477
 brother Lehi also, all the remainder of his days

27
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:33,915
5 For they remembered the words which their father

28
00:05:33,915 --> 00:05:52,582
 Helaman spake unto them. And these are the words

29
00:05:52,582 --> 00:06:11,249
 which he spake

30
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:12,671
6 Behold, my sons, I desire that ye should

31
00:06:12,671 --> 00:06:14,271
 remember to keep the commandments of God; and I would

32
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,871
 that ye should declare unto the people these words.

33
00:06:15,871 --> 00:06:17,471
 Behold, I have given unto you the names of our

34
00:06:17,471 --> 00:06:19,071
 first parents who came out of the land of Jerusalem;

35
00:06:19,071 --> 00:06:20,671
 and this I have done that when you remember your

36
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,271
 names ye may remember them; and when ye remember

37
00:06:22,271 --> 00:06:23,871
 them ye may remember their works; and when ye

38
00:06:23,871 --> 00:06:25,471
 remember their works ye may know how that it is said, and

39
00:06:25,471 --> 00:06:27,071
 also written, that they were good

40
00:06:27,02 --> 00:06:30,77
7 Therefore, my sons, I would that ye should do

41
00:06:30,77 --> 00:06:34,52
 that which is good, that it may be said of you, and

42
00:06:34,52 --> 00:06:38,27
 also written, even as it has been said and written

43
00:06:38,27 --> 00:06:42,02
 of them

44
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:43,969
8 And now my sons, behold I have somewhat more to

45
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:44,969
 desire of you, which desire is, that ye may not do

46
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:45,969
 these things that ye may boast, but that ye may

47
00:06:45,969 --> 00:06:46,969
 do these things to lay up for yourselves a treasure

48
00:06:46,969 --> 00:06:47,969
 in heaven, yea, which is eternal, and which

49
00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:48,969
 fadeth not away; yea, that ye may have that precious

50
00:06:48,969 --> 00:06:49,969
 gift of eternal life, which we have reason to

51
00:06:49,969 --> 00:06:50,969
 suppose hath been given to our fathers

52
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,277
9 O remember, remember, my sons, the words which

53
00:06:52,277 --> 00:06:53,61
 king Benjamin spake unto his people; yea, remember

54
00:06:53,61 --> 00:06:54,943
 that there is no other way nor means whereby man

55
00:06:54,943 --> 00:06:56,276
 can be saved, only through the atoning blood of

56
00:06:56,276 --> 00:06:57,609
 Jesus Christ, who shall come; yea, remember that he

57
00:06:57,609 --> 00:06:58,942
 cometh to redeem the world

58
00:06:58,918 --> 00:06:59,085
10 And remember also the words which Amulek spake

59
00:06:59,085 --> 00:06:59,252
 unto Zeezrom, in the city of Ammonihah; for he

60
00:06:59,252 --> 00:06:59,419
 said unto him that the Lord surely should come to

61
00:06:59,419 --> 00:06:59,587
 redeem his people, but that he should not come to

62
00:06:59,587 --> 00:06:59,753
 redeem them in their sins, but to redeem them from

63
00:06:59,753 --> 00:06:59,921
 their sins

64
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,352
11 And he hath power given unto him from the

65
00:07:01,352 --> 00:07:03,352
 Father to redeem them from their sins because of

66
00:07:03,352 --> 00:07:05,352
 repentance; therefore he hath sent his angels to declare

67
00:07:05,352 --> 00:07:07,352
 the tidings of the conditions of repentance,

68
00:07:07,352 --> 00:07:09,352
 which bringeth unto the power of the Redeemer, unto

69
00:07:09,352 --> 00:07:11,352
 the salvation of their souls

70
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:17,891
12 And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is

71
00:07:17,891 --> 00:07:24,618
 upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the

72
00:07:24,618 --> 00:07:31,345
 Son of God, that ye must build your foundation;

73
00:07:31,345 --> 00:07:38,072
 that when the devil shall send forth his mighty

74
00:07:38,072 --> 00:07:44,799
 winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when

75
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:51,526
 all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon

76
00:07:51,526 --> 00:07:58,253
 you, it shall have no power over you to drag you

77
00:07:58,253 --> 00:08:04,98
 down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of

78
00:08:04,98 --> 00:08:11,707
 the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure

79
00:08:11,707 --> 00:08:18,434
 foundation, a foundation whereon if men build

80
00:08:18,434 --> 00:08:25,161
 they cannot fall

81
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:31,072
13 And it came to pass that these were the words

82
00:08:31,072 --> 00:08:36,572
 which Helaman taught to his sons; yea, he did teach

83
00:08:36,572 --> 00:08:42,072
 them many things which are not written, and also

84
00:08:42,072 --> 00:08:47,572
 many things which are written

85
00:08:47,527 --> 00:09:07,527
14 And they did remember his words; and therefore

86
00:09:07,527 --> 00:09:27,527
 they went forth, keeping the commandments of God,

87
00:09:27,527 --> 00:09:47,527
 to teach the word of God among all the people of

88
00:09:47,527 --> 00:10:07,527
 Nephi, beginning at the city Bountiful

89
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:11,273
15 And from thenceforth to the city of Gid; and

90
00:10:11,273 --> 00:10:15,273
 from the city of Gid to the city of Mulek

91
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:15,498
16 And even from one city to another, until they

92
00:10:15,498 --> 00:10:15,748
 had gone forth among all the people of Nephi who

93
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:15,998
 were in the land southward; and from thence into the

94
00:10:15,998 --> 00:10:16,248
 land of Zarahemla, among the Lamanites

95
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,257
17 And it came to pass that they did preach with

96
00:10:18,257 --> 00:10:20,132
 great power, insomuch that they did confound many

97
00:10:20,132 --> 00:10:22,007
 of those dissenters who had gone over from the

98
00:10:22,007 --> 00:10:23,882
 Nephites, insomuch that they came forth and did

99
00:10:23,882 --> 00:10:25,757
 confess their sins and were baptized unto repentance,

100
00:10:25,757 --> 00:10:27,632
 and immediately returned to the Nephites to endeavor

101
00:10:27,632 --> 00:10:29,507
 to repair unto them the wrongs which they had

102
00:10:29,507 --> 00:10:31,382
 done

103
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:35,931
18 And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi did

104
00:10:35,931 --> 00:10:40,531
 preach unto the Lamanites with such great power and

105
00:10:40,531 --> 00:10:45,131
 authority, for they had power and authority given

106
00:10:45,131 --> 00:10:49,731
 unto them that they might speak, and they also had

107
00:10:49,731 --> 00:10:54,331
 what they should speak given unto them

108
00:10:54,554 --> 00:11:00,125
19 Therefore they did speak unto the great

109
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:05,696
 astonishment of the Lamanites, to the convincing them,

110
00:11:05,696 --> 00:11:11,267
 insomuch that there were eight thousand of the

111
00:11:11,267 --> 00:11:16,838
 Lamanites who were in the land of Zarahemla and round

112
00:11:16,838 --> 00:11:22,409
 about baptized unto repentance, and were convinced

113
00:11:22,409 --> 00:11:27,98
 of the wickedness of the traditions of their

114
00:11:27,98 --> 00:11:33,551
 fathers

115
00:11:33,159 --> 00:12:04,659
20 And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi did

116
00:12:04,659 --> 00:12:36,159
 proceed from thence to go to the land of Nephi

117
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:44,956
21 And it came to pass that they were taken by an

118
00:12:44,956 --> 00:12:52,956
 army of the Lamanites and cast into prison; yea,

119
00:12:52,956 --> 00:13:00,956
 even in that same prison in which Ammon and his

120
00:13:00,956 --> 00:13:08,956
 brethren were cast by the servants of Limhi

121
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:27,522
22 And after they had been cast into prison many

122
00:13:27,522 --> 00:13:46,189
 days without food, behold, they went forth into the

123
00:13:46,189 --> 00:14:04,856
 prison to take them that they might slay them

124
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:08,677
23 And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi were

125
00:14:08,677 --> 00:14:12,677
 encircled about as if by fire, even insomuch that

126
00:14:12,677 --> 00:14:16,677
 they durst not lay their hands upon them for fear

127
00:14:16,677 --> 00:14:20,677
 lest they should be burned. Nevertheless, Nephi and

128
00:14:20,677 --> 00:14:24,677
 Lehi were not burned; and they were as standing in

129
00:14:24,677 --> 00:14:28,677
 the midst of fire and were not burned

130
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:31,268
24 And when they saw that they were encircled

131
00:14:31,268 --> 00:14:33,935
 about with a pillar of fire, and that it burned them

132
00:14:33,935 --> 00:14:36,602
 not, their hearts did take courage

133
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:44,576
25 For they saw that the Lamanites durst not lay

134
00:14:44,576 --> 00:14:52,576
 their hands upon them; neither durst they come near

135
00:14:52,576 --> 00:15:00,576
 unto them, but stood as if they were struck dumb

136
00:15:00,576 --> 00:15:08,576
 with amazement

137
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:11,141
26 And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi did

138
00:15:11,141 --> 00:15:13,808
 stand forth and began to speak unto them, saying:

139
00:15:13,808 --> 00:15:16,475
 Fear not, for behold, it is God that has shown unto

140
00:15:16,475 --> 00:15:19,142
 you this marvelous thing, in the which is shown

141
00:15:19,142 --> 00:15:21,809
 unto you that ye cannot lay your hands on us to slay

142
00:15:21,809 --> 00:15:24,476
 us

143
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,091
27 And behold, when they had said these words, the

144
00:15:27,091 --> 00:15:29,757
 earth shook exceedingly, and the walls of the

145
00:15:29,757 --> 00:15:32,424
 prison did shake as if they were about to tumble to

146
00:15:32,424 --> 00:15:35,091
 the earth; but behold, they did not fall. And

147
00:15:35,091 --> 00:15:37,759
 behold, they that were in the prison were Lamanites and

148
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,425
 Nephites who were dissenters

149
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:45,706
28 And it came to pass that they were overshadowed

150
00:15:45,706 --> 00:15:51,039
 with a cloud of darkness, and an awful solemn

151
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:56,372
 fear came upon them

152
00:15:56,322 --> 00:16:10,722
29 And it came to pass that there came a voice as

153
00:16:10,722 --> 00:16:25,122
 if it were above the cloud of darkness, saying:

154
00:16:25,122 --> 00:16:39,522
 Repent ye, repent ye, and seek no more to destroy my

155
00:16:39,522 --> 00:16:53,922
 servants whom I have sent unto you to declare

156
00:16:53,922 --> 00:17:08,322
 good tidings

157
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:10,761
30 And it came to pass when they heard this voice,

158
00:17:10,761 --> 00:17:13,428
 and beheld that it was not a voice of thunder,

159
00:17:13,428 --> 00:17:16,095
 neither was it a voice of a great tumultuous noise,

160
00:17:16,095 --> 00:17:18,762
 but behold, it was a still voice of perfect

161
00:17:18,762 --> 00:17:21,429
 mildness, as if it had been a whisper, and it did pierce

162
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:24,096
 even to the very soul

163
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:31,876
31 And notwithstanding the mildness of the voice,

164
00:17:31,876 --> 00:17:39,709
 behold the earth shook exceedingly, and the walls

165
00:17:39,709 --> 00:17:47,542
 of the prison trembled again, as if it were about

166
00:17:47,542 --> 00:17:55,375
 to tumble to the earth; and behold the cloud of

167
00:17:55,375 --> 00:18:03,208
 darkness, which had overshadowed them, did not

168
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:11,041
 disperse

169
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:13,491
32 And behold the voice came again, saying: Repent

170
00:18:13,491 --> 00:18:15,091
 ye, repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at

171
00:18:15,091 --> 00:18:16,691
 hand; and seek no more to destroy my servants. And

172
00:18:16,691 --> 00:18:18,291
 it came to pass that the earth shook again, and the

173
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:19,891
 walls trembled

174
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:27,865
33 And also again the third time the voice came,

175
00:18:27,865 --> 00:18:35,865
 and did speak unto them marvelous words which

176
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:43,865
 cannot be uttered by man; and the walls did tremble

177
00:18:43,865 --> 00:18:51,865
 again, and the earth shook as if it were about to

178
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:59,865
 divide asunder

179
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:01,739
34 And it came to pass that the Lamanites could

180
00:19:01,739 --> 00:19:03,739
 not flee because of the cloud of darkness which did

181
00:19:03,739 --> 00:19:05,739
 overshadow them; yea, and also they were immovable

182
00:19:05,739 --> 00:19:07,739
 because of the fear which did come upon them

183
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:15,713
35 Now there was one among them who was a Nephite

184
00:19:15,713 --> 00:19:23,713
 by birth, who had once belonged to the church of

185
00:19:23,713 --> 00:19:31,713
 God but had dissented from them

186
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:32,637
36 And it came to pass that he turned him about,

187
00:19:32,637 --> 00:19:33,637
 and behold, he saw through the cloud of darkness

188
00:19:33,637 --> 00:19:34,637
 the faces of Nephi and Lehi; and behold, they did

189
00:19:34,637 --> 00:19:35,637
 shine exceedingly, even as the faces of angels. And

190
00:19:35,637 --> 00:19:36,637
 he beheld that they did lift their eyes to heaven;

191
00:19:36,637 --> 00:19:37,637
 and they were in the attitude as if talking or

192
00:19:37,637 --> 00:19:38,637
 lifting their voices to some being whom they beheld

193
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:39,637


194
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:41,212
37 And it came to pass that this man did cry unto

195
00:19:41,212 --> 00:19:42,812
 the multitude, that they might turn and look. And

196
00:19:42,812 --> 00:19:44,412
 behold, there was power given unto them that they

197
00:19:44,412 --> 00:19:46,012
 did turn and look; and they did behold the faces

198
00:19:46,012 --> 00:19:47,612
 of Nephi and Lehi

199
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:50,253
38 And they said unto the man: Behold, what do all

200
00:19:50,253 --> 00:19:52,92
 these things mean, and who is it with whom these

201
00:19:52,92 --> 00:19:55,587
 men do converse

202
00:19:55,561 --> 00:20:00,894
39 Now the man’s name was Aminadab. And Aminadab

203
00:20:00,894 --> 00:20:06,227
 said unto them: They do converse with the angels of

204
00:20:06,227 --> 00:20:11,56
 God

205
00:20:11,51 --> 00:20:11,843
40 And it came to pass that the Lamanites said

206
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:12,176
 unto him: What shall we do, that this cloud of

207
00:20:12,176 --> 00:20:12,509
 darkness may be removed from overshadowing us

208
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:14,178
41 And Aminadab said unto them: You must repent,

209
00:20:14,178 --> 00:20:16,345
 and cry unto the voice, even until ye shall have

210
00:20:16,345 --> 00:20:18,512
 faith in Christ, who was taught unto you by Alma,

211
00:20:18,512 --> 00:20:20,679
 and Amulek, and Zeezrom; and when ye shall do this,

212
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:22,846
 the cloud of darkness shall be removed from

213
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:25,013
 overshadowing you

214
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:30,557
42 And it came to pass that they all did begin to

215
00:20:30,557 --> 00:20:36,057
 cry unto the voice of him who had shaken the

216
00:20:36,057 --> 00:20:41,557
 earth; yea, they did cry even until the cloud of

217
00:20:41,557 --> 00:20:47,057
 darkness was dispersed

218
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:52,713
43 And it came to pass that when they cast their

219
00:20:52,713 --> 00:20:58,113
 eyes about, and saw that the cloud of darkness was

220
00:20:58,113 --> 00:21:03,513
 dispersed from overshadowing them, behold, they

221
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:08,913
 saw that they were encircled about, yea every soul,

222
00:21:08,913 --> 00:21:14,313
 by a pillar of fire

223
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:20,24
44 And Nephi and Lehi were in the midst of them;

224
00:21:20,24 --> 00:21:26,407
 yea, they were encircled about; yea, they were as

225
00:21:26,407 --> 00:21:32,574
 if in the midst of a flaming fire, yet it did harm

226
00:21:32,574 --> 00:21:38,741
 them not, neither did it take hold upon the walls

227
00:21:38,741 --> 00:21:44,908
 of the prison; and they were filled with that joy

228
00:21:44,908 --> 00:21:51,075
 which is unspeakable and full of glory

229
00:21:51,01 --> 00:21:55,76
45 And behold, the Holy Spirit of God did come

230
00:21:55,76 --> 00:22:00,51
 down from heaven, and did enter into their hearts,

231
00:22:00,51 --> 00:22:05,26
 and they were filled as if with fire, and they could

232
00:22:05,26 --> 00:22:10,01
 speak forth marvelous words

233
00:22:10,963 --> 00:22:15,63
46 And it came to pass that there came a voice

234
00:22:15,63 --> 00:22:20,297
 unto them, yea, a pleasant voice, as if it were a

235
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:24,964
 whisper, saying

236
00:22:24,243 --> 00:22:29,243
47 Peace, peace be unto you, because of your faith

237
00:22:29,243 --> 00:22:34,243
 in my Well Beloved, who was from the foundation

238
00:22:34,243 --> 00:22:39,243
 of the world

239
00:22:39,225 --> 00:22:44,225
48 And now, when they heard this they cast up

240
00:22:44,225 --> 00:22:49,225
 their eyes as if to behold from whence the voice came;

241
00:22:49,225 --> 00:22:54,225
 and behold, they saw the heavens open; and angels

242
00:22:54,225 --> 00:22:59,225
 came down out of heaven and ministered unto them

243
00:22:59,225 --> 00:23:04,225


244
00:23:04,25 --> 00:23:08,0
49 And there were about three hundred souls who

245
00:23:08,0 --> 00:23:13,75
 saw and heard these things; and they were bidden to

246
00:23:13,75 --> 00:23:18,5
 go forth and marvel not, neither should they

247
00:23:18,5 --> 00:23:23,25
 doubt

248
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:28,049
50 And it came to pass that they did go forth, and

249
00:23:28,049 --> 00:23:32,763
 did minister unto the people, declaring

250
00:23:32,763 --> 00:23:37,477
 throughout all the regions round about all the things which

251
00:23:37,477 --> 00:23:42,191
 they had heard and seen, insomuch that the more

252
00:23:42,191 --> 00:23:46,905
 part of the Lamanites were convinced of them,

253
00:23:46,905 --> 00:23:51,619
 because of the greatness of the evidences which they

254
00:23:51,619 --> 00:23:56,333
 had received

255
00:23:56,335 --> 00:24:02,668
51 And as many as were convinced did lay down

256
00:24:02,668 --> 00:24:09,001
 their weapons of war, and also their hatred and the

257
00:24:09,001 --> 00:24:15,334
 tradition of their fathers

258
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:20,587
52 And it came to pass that they did yield up unto

259
00:24:20,587 --> 00:24:25,587
 the Nephites the lands of their possession.
