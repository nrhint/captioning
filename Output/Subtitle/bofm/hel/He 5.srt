00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 5 Nephi and Lehi devote themselves to

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
preaching—Their names invite them to pattern their

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
lives after their forebears—Christ redeems

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
those who repent—Nephi and Lehi make many converts

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and are imprisoned, and fire encircles them—A

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
cloud of darkness overshadows three hundred

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
people—The earth shakes, and a voice commands men to

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
repent—Nephi and Lehi converse with angels, and

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:18:37,
the multitude is encircled by fire. About 30 B.C. 

10
00:18:37,0 --> 00:18:37,0
1 And it came to pass that in this same

11
00:18:37,0 --> 00:18:37,0
year, behold, Nephi delivered up the

12
00:18:37,0 --> 00:18:51,
judgment-seat to a man whose name was Cezoram.

13
00:18:51,0 --> 00:18:51,0
2 For as their laws and their

14
00:18:51,0 --> 00:18:51,0
governments were established by the voice of the

15
00:18:51,0 --> 00:18:51,0
people, and they who chose evil were

16
00:18:51,0 --> 00:18:51,0
more numerous than they who chose good,

17
00:18:51,0 --> 00:18:51,0
therefore they were ripening for

18
00:18:51,0 --> 00:25:59,
destruction, for the laws had become corrupted.

19
00:25:59,0 --> 00:25:59,0
3 Yea, and this was not all;

20
00:25:59,0 --> 00:25:59,0
they were a stiffnecked people,

21
00:25:59,0 --> 00:25:59,0
insomuch that they could not be

22
00:25:59,0 --> 00:25:59,0
governed by the law nor justice,

23
00:25:59,0 --> 00:32:39,
save it were to their destruction.

24
00:32:39,0 --> 00:32:39,0
4 And it came to pass that

25
00:32:39,0 --> 00:32:39,0
Nephi had become weary because of

26
00:32:39,0 --> 00:32:39,0
their iniquity; and he yielded

27
00:32:39,0 --> 00:32:39,0
up the judgment-seat, and took

28
00:32:39,0 --> 00:32:39,0
it upon him to preach the word

29
00:32:39,0 --> 00:32:39,0
of God all the remainder of his

30
00:32:39,0 --> 00:32:39,0
days, and his brother Lehi

31
00:32:39,0 --> 00:32:11,
also, all the remainder of his days;

32
00:32:11,0 --> 00:32:11,0
5 For they remembered the

33
00:32:11,0 --> 00:32:11,0
words which their father

34
00:32:11,0 --> 00:32:11,0
Helaman spake unto them. And

35
00:32:11,0 --> 00:31:43,
these are the words which he spake:

36
00:31:43,0 --> 00:31:43,0
6 Behold, my sons, I

37
00:31:43,0 --> 00:31:43,0
desire that ye should remember

38
00:31:43,0 --> 00:31:43,0
to keep the commandments

39
00:31:43,0 --> 00:31:43,0
of God; and I would that ye

40
00:31:43,0 --> 00:31:43,0
should declare unto the

41
00:31:43,0 --> 00:31:43,0
people these words. Behold,

42
00:31:43,0 --> 00:31:43,0
I have given unto you the

43
00:31:43,0 --> 00:31:43,0
names of our first

44
00:31:43,0 --> 00:31:43,0
parents who came out of the land

45
00:31:43,0 --> 00:31:43,0
of Jerusalem; and this I

46
00:31:43,0 --> 00:31:43,0
have done that when you

47
00:31:43,0 --> 00:31:43,0
remember your names ye may

48
00:31:43,0 --> 00:31:43,0
remember them; and when ye

49
00:31:43,0 --> 00:31:43,0
remember them ye may

50
00:31:43,0 --> 00:31:43,0
remember their works; and when

51
00:31:43,0 --> 00:31:43,0
ye remember their works ye

52
00:31:43,0 --> 00:31:43,0
may know how that it is

53
00:31:43,0 --> 00:33:55,
said, and also written, that they were good.

54
00:33:55,0 --> 00:33:55,0
7 Therefore, my sons,

55
00:33:55,0 --> 00:33:55,0
I would that ye should

56
00:33:55,0 --> 00:33:55,0
do that which is

57
00:33:55,0 --> 00:33:55,0
good, that it may be said

58
00:33:55,0 --> 00:33:55,0
of you, and also

59
00:33:55,0 --> 00:33:55,0
written, even as it has

60
00:33:55,0 --> 00:41:25,
been said and written of them.

61
00:41:25,0 --> 00:41:25,0
8 And now my sons,

62
00:41:25,0 --> 00:41:25,0
behold I have somewhat

63
00:41:25,0 --> 00:41:25,0
more to desire of

64
00:41:25,0 --> 00:41:25,0
you, which desire is,

65
00:41:25,0 --> 00:41:25,0
that ye may not do

66
00:41:25,0 --> 00:41:25,0
these things that ye may

67
00:41:25,0 --> 00:41:25,0
boast, but that ye

68
00:41:25,0 --> 00:41:25,0
may do these things to

69
00:41:25,0 --> 00:41:25,0
lay up for yourselves

70
00:41:25,0 --> 00:41:25,0
a treasure in

71
00:41:25,0 --> 00:41:25,0
heaven, yea, which is

72
00:41:25,0 --> 00:41:25,0
eternal, and which fadeth

73
00:41:25,0 --> 00:41:25,0
not away; yea, that

74
00:41:25,0 --> 00:41:25,0
ye may have that

75
00:41:25,0 --> 00:41:25,0
precious gift of eternal

76
00:41:25,0 --> 00:41:25,0
life, which we have

77
00:41:25,0 --> 00:41:25,0
reason to suppose hath

78
00:41:25,0 --> 00:48:33,
been given to our fathers.

79
00:48:33,0 --> 00:48:33,0
9 O remember,

80
00:48:33,0 --> 00:48:33,0
remember, my sons, the

81
00:48:33,0 --> 00:48:33,0
words which king

82
00:48:33,0 --> 00:48:33,0
Benjamin spake unto

83
00:48:33,0 --> 00:48:33,0
his people; yea,

84
00:48:33,0 --> 00:48:33,0
remember that there is

85
00:48:33,0 --> 00:48:33,0
no other way nor

86
00:48:33,0 --> 00:48:33,0
means whereby man can

87
00:48:33,0 --> 00:48:33,0
be saved, only

88
00:48:33,0 --> 00:48:33,0
through the atoning

89
00:48:33,0 --> 00:48:33,0
blood of Jesus

90
00:48:33,0 --> 00:48:33,0
Christ, who shall come;

91
00:48:33,0 --> 00:48:33,0
yea, remember that

92
00:48:33,0 --> 00:55:14,
he cometh to redeem the world.

93
00:55:14,0 --> 00:55:14,0
10 And remember

94
00:55:14,0 --> 00:55:14,0
also the words which

95
00:55:14,0 --> 00:55:14,0
Amulek spake unto

96
00:55:14,0 --> 00:55:14,0
Zeezrom, in the

97
00:55:14,0 --> 00:55:14,0
city of Ammonihah;

98
00:55:14,0 --> 00:55:14,0
for he said unto

99
00:55:14,0 --> 00:55:14,0
him that the Lord

100
00:55:14,0 --> 00:55:14,0
surely should come

101
00:55:14,0 --> 00:55:14,0
to redeem his

102
00:55:14,0 --> 00:55:14,0
people, but that he

103
00:55:14,0 --> 00:55:14,0
should not come to

104
00:55:14,0 --> 00:55:14,0
redeem them in

105
00:55:14,0 --> 00:55:14,0
their sins, but to

106
00:55:14,0 --> 01:04:23,
redeem them from their sins.

107
01:04:23,0 --> 01:04:23,0
11 And he hath

108
01:04:23,0 --> 01:04:23,0
power given unto

109
01:04:23,0 --> 01:04:23,0
him from the Father

110
01:04:23,0 --> 01:04:23,0
to redeem them

111
01:04:23,0 --> 01:04:23,0
from their sins

112
01:04:23,0 --> 01:04:23,0
because of

113
01:04:23,0 --> 01:04:23,0
repentance; therefore he

114
01:04:23,0 --> 01:04:23,0
hath sent his

115
01:04:23,0 --> 01:04:23,0
angels to declare

116
01:04:23,0 --> 01:04:23,0
the tidings of the

117
01:04:23,0 --> 01:04:23,0
conditions of

118
01:04:23,0 --> 01:04:23,0
repentance, which

119
01:04:23,0 --> 01:04:23,0
bringeth unto the

120
01:04:23,0 --> 01:04:23,0
power of the

121
01:04:23,0 --> 01:04:23,0
Redeemer, unto the

122
01:04:23,0 --> 01:05:35,
salvation of their souls.

123
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
12 And now, my

124
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
sons, remember,

125
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
remember that it

126
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
is upon the rock

127
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
of our

128
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
Redeemer, who is Christ,

129
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
the Son of God,

130
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
that ye must

131
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
build your

132
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
foundation; that when

133
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
the devil shall

134
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
send forth his

135
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
mighty winds, yea,

136
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
his shafts in

137
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
the whirlwind,

138
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
yea, when all his

139
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
hail and his

140
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
mighty storm shall

141
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
beat upon you,

142
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
it shall have no

143
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
power over you

144
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
to drag you down

145
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
to the gulf of

146
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
misery and

147
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
endless wo, because of

148
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
the rock upon

149
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
which ye are

150
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
built, which is a

151
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
sure foundation, a

152
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
foundation

153
01:05:35,0 --> 01:07:47,
whereon if men build they cannot fall.

154
01:07:47,0 --> 01:07:47,0
13 And it came

155
01:07:47,0 --> 01:07:47,0
to pass that

156
01:07:47,0 --> 01:07:47,0
these were the

157
01:07:47,0 --> 01:07:47,0
words which

158
01:07:47,0 --> 01:07:47,0
Helaman taught to

159
01:07:47,0 --> 01:07:47,0
his sons; yea, he

160
01:07:47,0 --> 01:07:47,0
did teach them

161
01:07:47,0 --> 01:07:47,0
many things

162
01:07:47,0 --> 01:07:47,0
which are not

163
01:07:47,0 --> 01:07:47,0
written, and also

164
01:07:47,0 --> 01:07:47,0
many things

165
01:07:47,0 --> 01:23:14,
which are written.

166
01:23:14,0 --> 01:23:14,0
14 And they

167
01:23:14,0 --> 01:23:14,0
did remember his

168
01:23:14,0 --> 01:23:14,0
words; and

169
01:23:14,0 --> 01:23:14,0
therefore they

170
01:23:14,0 --> 01:23:14,0
went forth,

171
01:23:14,0 --> 01:23:14,0
keeping the

172
01:23:14,0 --> 01:23:14,0
commandments of

173
01:23:14,0 --> 01:23:14,0
God, to teach the

174
01:23:14,0 --> 01:23:14,0
word of God

175
01:23:14,0 --> 01:23:14,0
among all the

176
01:23:14,0 --> 01:23:14,0
people of

177
01:23:14,0 --> 01:23:14,0
Nephi, beginning at

178
01:23:14,0 --> 01:27:27,
the city Bountiful;

179
01:27:27,0 --> 01:27:27,0
15 And from

180
01:27:27,0 --> 01:27:27,0
thenceforth

181
01:27:27,0 --> 01:27:27,0
to the city

182
01:27:27,0 --> 01:27:27,0
of Gid; and

183
01:27:27,0 --> 01:27:27,0
from the

184
01:27:27,0 --> 01:27:27,0
city of Gid to

185
01:27:27,0 --> 01:26:59,
the city of Mulek;

186
01:26:59,0 --> 01:26:59,0
16 And even

187
01:26:59,0 --> 01:26:59,0
from one

188
01:26:59,0 --> 01:26:59,0
city to

189
01:26:59,0 --> 01:26:59,0
another, until

190
01:26:59,0 --> 01:26:59,0
they had

191
01:26:59,0 --> 01:26:59,0
gone forth

192
01:26:59,0 --> 01:26:59,0
among all the

193
01:26:59,0 --> 01:26:59,0
people of

194
01:26:59,0 --> 01:26:59,0
Nephi who

195
01:26:59,0 --> 01:26:59,0
were in the

196
01:26:59,0 --> 01:26:59,0
land

197
01:26:59,0 --> 01:26:59,0
southward; and

198
01:26:59,0 --> 01:26:59,0
from thence

199
01:26:59,0 --> 01:26:59,0
into the

200
01:26:59,0 --> 01:26:59,0
land of

201
01:26:59,0 --> 01:28:43,
Zarahemla, among the Lamanites.

202
01:28:43,0 --> 01:28:43,0
17 And it

203
01:28:43,0 --> 01:28:43,0
came to pass

204
01:28:43,0 --> 01:28:43,0
that they

205
01:28:43,0 --> 01:28:43,0
did preach

206
01:28:43,0 --> 01:28:43,0
with great

207
01:28:43,0 --> 01:28:43,0
power,

208
01:28:43,0 --> 01:28:43,0
insomuch that

209
01:28:43,0 --> 01:28:43,0
they did

210
01:28:43,0 --> 01:28:43,0
confound many

211
01:28:43,0 --> 01:28:43,0
of those

212
01:28:43,0 --> 01:28:43,0
dissenters

213
01:28:43,0 --> 01:28:43,0
who had gone

214
01:28:43,0 --> 01:28:43,0
over from

215
01:28:43,0 --> 01:28:43,0
the

216
01:28:43,0 --> 01:28:43,0
Nephites, insomuch

217
01:28:43,0 --> 01:28:43,0
that they

218
01:28:43,0 --> 01:28:43,0
came forth

219
01:28:43,0 --> 01:28:43,0
and did

220
01:28:43,0 --> 01:28:43,0
confess their

221

01:28:43,0 --> 01:28:43,0
unto

224
01:28:43,0 --> 01:28:43,0

they had done.

234
01:28:15,0 --> 01:28:15,0
18 And it

235
01:28:15,0 --> 01:28:15,0
came to

236
01:28:15,0 --> 01:28:15,0
pass that

237
01:28:15,0 --> 01:28:15,0
Nephi and

238
01:28:15,0 --> 01:28:15,0
Lehi did

239
01:28:15,0 --> 01:28:15,0
preach unto

240
01:28:15,0 --> 01:28:15,0
the

241
01:28:15,0 --> 01:28:15,0
Lamanites with

242
01:28:15,0 --> 01:28:15,0

243
01:28:15,0 --> 01:28:15,0

244
01:28:15,0 --> 01:28:15,0
authority,

245
01:28:15,0 --> 01:28:15,0
for they

246
01:28:15,0 --> 01:28:15,0
had power

247

01:28:15,0 --> 01:28:15,0
unto them

250
01:28:15,0 --> 01:28:15,0
that they

251
01:28:15,0 --> 01:28:15,0
might

252
01:28:15,0 --> 01:28:15,0

253
01:28:15,0 --> 01:28:15,0
also had

254

01:27:47,0 --> 01:27:47,0
19

257
01:27:47,0 --> 01:27:47,0
Therefore they

258

did speak

259
01:27:47,0 --> 01:27:47,0

262
01:27:47,0 --> 01:27:47,0
astonishment of the

01:27:47,0 --> 01:27:47,0


266
01:27:47,0 --> 01:27:47,0

01:27:47,0 --> 01:27:47,0
insomuch

268
01:27:47,0 --> 01:27:47,0

283
01:27:47,0 --> 01:27:47,0
convinced of

284
01:27:47,0 --> 01:27:47,0
the

285
01:27:47,0 --> 01:27:47,0
wickedness of

the traditions of their fathers.

287
01:28:59,0 --> 01:28:59,0
20 And

288
01:28:59,0 --> 01:28:59,0
it came

289
01:28:59,0 --> 01:28:59,0

298
01:28:31,0 --> 01:28:31,0
21 And

299
01:28:31,0 --> 01:28:31,0
