00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:02,444
Chapter 5 Nephi and Lehi devote themselves to

2
00:00:02,444 --> 00:00:04,888
preaching—Their names invite them to pattern their

3
00:00:04,888 --> 00:00:07,332
lives after their forebears—Christ redeems

4
00:00:07,332 --> 00:00:09,776
those who repent—Nephi and Lehi make many converts

5
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:12,22
and are imprisoned, and fire encircles them—A

6
00:00:12,22 --> 00:00:14,664
cloud of darkness overshadows three hundred

7
00:00:14,664 --> 00:00:17,108
people—The earth shakes, and a voice commands men to

8
00:00:17,108 --> 00:00:19,552
repent—Nephi and Lehi converse with angels, and

9
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:22,256
the multitude is encircled by fire. About 30 B.C. 

10
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:26,589
1 And it came to pass that in this same

11
00:00:26,589 --> 00:00:30,922
year, behold, Nephi delivered up the

12
00:00:30,922 --> 00:00:35,602
judgment-seat to a man whose name was Cezoram.

13
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:40,102
2 For as their laws and their

14
00:00:40,102 --> 00:00:44,602
governments were established by the voice of the

15
00:00:44,602 --> 00:00:49,102
people, and they who chose evil were

16
00:00:49,102 --> 00:00:53,602
more numerous than they who chose good,

17
00:00:53,602 --> 00:00:58,102
therefore they were ripening for

18
00:00:58,102 --> 00:01:02,529
destruction, for the laws had become corrupted.

19
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:02,529
3 Yea, and this was not all;

20
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:02,529
they were a stiffnecked people,

21
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:02,529
insomuch that they could not be

22
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:02,529
governed by the law nor justice,

23
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:02,996
save it were to their destruction.

24
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:02,996
4 And it came to pass that

25
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:02,996
Nephi had become weary because of

26
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:02,996
their iniquity; and he yielded

27
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:02,996
up the judgment-seat, and took

28
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:02,996
it upon him to preach the word

29
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:02,996
of God all the remainder of his

30
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:02,996
days, and his brother Lehi

31
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:02,062
also, all the remainder of his days;

32
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:01,812
5 For they remembered the

33
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:01,562
words which their father

34
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:01,312
Helaman spake unto them. And

35
00:01:01,312 --> 00:01:01,128
these are the words which he spake:

36
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:01,128
6 Behold, my sons, I

37
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:01,128
desire that ye should remember

38
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:01,128
to keep the commandments

39
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:01,128
of God; and I would that ye

40
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:01,128
should declare unto the

41
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:01,128
people these words. Behold,

42
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:01,128
I have given unto you the

43
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:01,128
names of our first

44
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:01,128
parents who came out of the land

45
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:01,128
of Jerusalem; and this I

46
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:01,128
have done that when you

47
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:01,128
remember your names ye may

48
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:01,128
remember them; and when ye

49
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:01,128
remember them ye may

50
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:01,128
remember their works; and when

51
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:01,128
ye remember their works ye

52
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:01,128
may know how that it is

53
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:01,595
said, and also written, that they were good.

54
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
7 Therefore, my sons,

55
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
I would that ye should

56
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
do that which is

57
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
good, that it may be said

58
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
of you, and also

59
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
written, even as it has

60
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
been said and written of them.

61
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
8 And now my sons,

62
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
behold I have somewhat

63
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
more to desire of

64
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
you, which desire is,

65
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
that ye may not do

66
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
these things that ye may

67
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
boast, but that ye

68
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
may do these things to

69
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
lay up for yourselves

70
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
a treasure in

71
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
heaven, yea, which is

72
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
eternal, and which fadeth

73
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
not away; yea, that

74
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
ye may have that

75
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
precious gift of eternal

76
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
life, which we have

77
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
reason to suppose hath

78
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
been given to our fathers.

79
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
9 O remember,

80
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
remember, my sons, the

81
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
words which king

82
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
Benjamin spake unto

83
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
his people; yea,

84
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
remember that there is

85
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
no other way nor

86
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
means whereby man can

87
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
be saved, only

88
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
through the atoning

89
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
blood of Jesus

90
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
Christ, who shall come;

91
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
yea, remember that

92
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
he cometh to redeem the world.

93
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
10 And remember

94
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
also the words which

95
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
Amulek spake unto

96
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
Zeezrom, in the

97
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
city of Ammonihah;

98
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
for he said unto

99
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
him that the Lord

100
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
surely should come

101
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
to redeem his

102
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
people, but that he

103
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
should not come to

104
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
redeem them in

105
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
their sins, but to

106
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
redeem them from their sins.

107
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
11 And he hath

108
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
power given unto

109
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
him from the Father

110
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
to redeem them

111
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
from their sins

112
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
because of

113
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
repentance; therefore he

114
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
hath sent his

115
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
angels to declare

116
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
the tidings of the

117
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
conditions of

118
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
repentance, which

119
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
bringeth unto the

120
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
power of the

121
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
Redeemer, unto the

122
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
salvation of their souls.

123
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
12 And now, my

124
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
sons, remember,

125
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
remember that it

126
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
is upon the rock

127
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
of our

128
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
Redeemer, who is Christ,

129
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
the Son of God,

130
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
that ye must

131
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
build your

132
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
foundation; that when

133
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
the devil shall

134
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
send forth his

135
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
mighty winds, yea,

136
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
his shafts in

137
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
the whirlwind,

138
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
yea, when all his

139
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
hail and his

140
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
mighty storm shall

141
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
beat upon you,

142
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
it shall have no

143
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
power over you

144
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
to drag you down

145
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
to the gulf of

146
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
misery and

147
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
endless wo, because of

148
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
the rock upon

149
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
which ye are

150
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
built, which is a

151
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
sure foundation, a

152
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
foundation

153
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
whereon if men build they cannot fall.

154
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
13 And it came

155
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
to pass that

156
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
these were the

157
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
words which

158
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
Helaman taught to

159
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
his sons; yea, he

160
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
did teach them

161
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
many things

162
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
which are not

163
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
written, and also

164
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
many things

165
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
which are written.

166
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
14 And they

167
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
did remember his

168
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
words; and

169
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
therefore they

170
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
went forth,

171
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
keeping the

172
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
commandments of

173
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
God, to teach the

174
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
word of God

175
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
among all the

176
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
people of

177
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
Nephi, beginning at

178
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
the city Bountiful;

179
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
15 And from

180
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
thenceforth

181
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
to the city

182
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
of Gid; and

183
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
from the

184
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
city of Gid to

185
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
the city of Mulek;

186
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
16 And even

187
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
from one

188
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
city to

189
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
another, until

190
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
they had

191
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
gone forth

192
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
among all the

193
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
people of

194
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
Nephi who

195
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
were in the

196
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
land

197
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
southward; and

198
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
from thence

199
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
into the

200
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
land of

201
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
Zarahemla, among the Lamanites.

202
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
17 And it

203
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
came to pass

204
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
that they

205
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
did preach

206
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
with great

207
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
power,

208
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
insomuch that

209
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
they did

210
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
confound many

211
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
of those

212
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
dissenters

213
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
who had gone

214
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
over from

215
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
the

216
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
Nephites, insomuch

217
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
that they

218
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
came forth

219
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
and did

220
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
confess their

221
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
sins and

222
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
were baptized

223
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
unto

224
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
repentance, and

225
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
immediately

226
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
returned to

227
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
the

228
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
Nephites to

229
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
endeavor to

230
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
repair unto

231
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
them the

232
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
wrongs which

233
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
they had done.

234
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
18 And it

235
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
came to

236
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
pass that

237
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
Nephi and

238
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
Lehi did

239
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
preach unto

240
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
the

241
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
Lamanites with

242
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
such great

243
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
power and

244
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
authority,

245
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
for they

246
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
had power

247
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
and

248
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
authority given

249
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
unto them

250
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
that they

251
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
might

252
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
speak, and they

253
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
also had

254
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
what they

255
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
should speak given unto them—

256
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
19

257
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
Therefore they

258
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
did speak

259
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
unto the

260
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
great

261
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595


262
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
astonishment of the

263
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595


264
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
Lamanites, to the

265
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595


266
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
convincing them,

267
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
insomuch

268
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
that there

269
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
were

270
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
eight

271
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
thousand of the

272
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595


273
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
Lamanites who

274
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
were in the

275
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
land of

276
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
Zarahemla

277
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
and round

278
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595

279
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595

280
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
unto

281
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
repentance, and

282
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
were

283
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
convinced of

284
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
the

285
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
wickedness of

286
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
the traditions of their fathers.

287
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
20 And

288
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
it came

289
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
to pass

290
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
that

291
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
Nephi and

292
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
Lehi did

293
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
proceed

294
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
from

295
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
thence to go

296
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
to the

297
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
land of Nephi.

298
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
21 And

299
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
it came

300
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
to

301
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
pass that

they

303
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595

Lamanites and

309
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
cast

310
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
into

cast by the servants of Limhi.

322

22 And

323
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
after

332
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
behold,

333
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:01,595
