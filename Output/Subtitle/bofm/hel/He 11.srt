00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 11 Nephi persuades the Lord to

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
replace their war with a famine—Many people

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
perish—They repent, and Nephi importunes

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Lord for rain—Nephi and Lehi receive

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
many revelations—The Gadianton robbers

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:03:31,
entrench themselves in the land. About 20–6 B.C. 

7
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
1 And now it came to pass in the seventy

8
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
and second year of the reign of the

9
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
judges that the contentions did increase,

10
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
insomuch that there were wars throughout

11
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:03,
all the land among all the people of Nephi.

12
00:03:03,0 --> 00:03:03,0
2 And it was this secret band of

13
00:03:03,0 --> 00:03:03,0
robbers who did carry on this work of

14
00:03:03,0 --> 00:03:03,0
destruction and wickedness. And this war

15
00:03:03,0 --> 00:03:03,0
did last all that year; and in the

16
00:03:03,0 --> 00:02:35,
seventy and third year it did also last.

17
00:02:35,0 --> 00:02:35,0
3 And it came to pass

18
00:02:35,0 --> 00:02:35,0
that in this year Nephi did

19
00:02:35,0 --> 00:02:07,
cry unto the Lord, saying:

20
00:02:07,0 --> 00:02:07,0
4 O Lord, do not suffer

21
00:02:07,0 --> 00:02:07,0
that this people shall

22
00:02:07,0 --> 00:02:07,0
be destroyed by the

23
00:02:07,0 --> 00:02:07,0
sword; but O Lord, rather

24
00:02:07,0 --> 00:02:07,0
let there be a famine

25
00:02:07,0 --> 00:02:07,0
in the land, to stir

26
00:02:07,0 --> 00:02:07,0
them up in remembrance of

27
00:02:07,0 --> 00:02:07,0
the Lord their God,

28
00:02:07,0 --> 00:02:07,0
and perhaps they will

29
00:02:07,0 --> 00:01:39,
repent and turn unto thee.

30
00:01:39,0 --> 00:01:39,0
5 And so it was done,

31
00:01:39,0 --> 00:01:39,0
according to the words

32
00:01:39,0 --> 00:01:39,0
of Nephi. And there

33
00:01:39,0 --> 00:01:39,0
was a great famine upon

34
00:01:39,0 --> 00:01:39,0
the land, among all

35
00:01:39,0 --> 00:01:39,0
the people of Nephi.

36
00:01:39,0 --> 00:01:39,0
And thus in the seventy

37
00:01:39,0 --> 00:01:39,0
and fourth year the

38
00:01:39,0 --> 00:01:39,0
famine did continue, and

39
00:01:39,0 --> 00:01:39,0
the work of

40
00:01:39,0 --> 00:01:39,0
destruction did cease by the

41
00:01:39,0 --> 00:01:11,
sword but became sore by famine.

42
00:01:11,0 --> 00:01:11,0
6 And this work of

43
00:01:11,0 --> 00:01:11,0
destruction did also

44
00:01:11,0 --> 00:01:11,0
continue in the seventy

45
00:01:11,0 --> 00:01:11,0
and fifth year. For

46
00:01:11,0 --> 00:01:11,0
the earth was smitten

47
00:01:11,0 --> 00:01:11,0
that it was dry, and

48
00:01:11,0 --> 00:01:11,0
did not yield forth

49
00:01:11,0 --> 00:01:11,0
grain in the season

50
00:01:11,0 --> 00:01:11,0
of grain; and the

51
00:01:11,0 --> 00:01:11,0
whole earth was smitten,

52
00:01:11,0 --> 00:01:11,0
even among the

53
00:01:11,0 --> 00:01:11,0
Lamanites as well as among

54
00:01:11,0 --> 00:01:11,0
the Nephites, so that

55
00:01:11,0 --> 00:01:11,0
they were smitten

56
00:01:11,0 --> 00:01:11,0
that they did perish by

57
00:01:11,0 --> 00:01:11,0
thousands in the

58
00:01:11,0 --> 00:00:43,
more wicked parts of the land.

59
00:00:43,0 --> 00:00:43,0
7 And it came to

60
00:00:43,0 --> 00:00:43,0
pass that the people

61
00:00:43,0 --> 00:00:43,0
saw that they were

62
00:00:43,0 --> 00:00:43,0
about to perish by

63
00:00:43,0 --> 00:00:43,0
famine, and they

64
00:00:43,0 --> 00:00:43,0
began to remember the

65
00:00:43,0 --> 00:00:43,0
Lord their God;

66
00:00:43,0 --> 00:00:43,0
and they began to

67
00:00:43,0 --> 00:00:15,
remember the words of Nephi.

68
00:00:15,0 --> 00:00:15,0
8 And the people

69
00:00:15,0 --> 00:00:15,0
began to plead with

70
00:00:15,0 --> 00:00:15,0
their chief

71
00:00:15,0 --> 00:00:15,0
judges and their

72
00:00:15,0 --> 00:00:15,0
leaders, that they would

73
00:00:15,0 --> 00:00:15,0
say unto Nephi:

74
00:00:15,0 --> 00:00:15,0
Behold, we know

75
00:00:15,0 --> 00:00:15,0
that thou art a man

76
00:00:15,0 --> 00:00:15,0
of God, and

77
00:00:15,0 --> 00:00:15,0
therefore cry unto the

78
00:00:15,0 --> 00:00:15,0
Lord our God that he

79
00:00:15,0 --> 00:00:15,0
turn away from us

80
00:00:15,0 --> 00:00:15,0
this famine, lest

81
00:00:15,0 --> 00:00:15,0
all the words

82
00:00:15,0 --> 00:00:15,0
which thou hast

83
00:00:15,0 --> 00:00:15,0
spoken concerning our

84
00:00:15,0 --> 00:01:27,
destruction be fulfilled.

85
00:01:27,0 --> 00:01:27,0
9 And it came to

86
00:01:27,0 --> 00:01:27,0
pass that the

87
00:01:27,0 --> 00:01:27,0
judges did say unto

88
00:01:27,0 --> 00:01:27,0
Nephi, according

89
00:01:27,0 --> 00:01:27,0
to the words

90
00:01:27,0 --> 00:01:27,0
which had been

91
00:01:27,0 --> 00:01:27,0
desired. And it came to

92
00:01:27,0 --> 00:01:27,0
pass that when

93
00:01:27,0 --> 00:01:27,0
Nephi saw that the

94
00:01:27,0 --> 00:01:27,0
people had

95
00:01:27,0 --> 00:01:27,0
repented and did

96
00:01:27,0 --> 00:01:27,0
humble themselves in

97
00:01:27,0 --> 00:01:27,0
sackcloth, he

98
00:01:27,0 --> 00:00:59,
cried again unto the Lord, saying:

99
00:00:59,0 --> 00:00:59,0
10 O Lord,

100
00:00:59,0 --> 00:00:59,0
behold this people

101
00:00:59,0 --> 00:00:59,0
repenteth; and

102
00:00:59,0 --> 00:00:59,0
they have swept

103
00:00:59,0 --> 00:00:59,0
away the band of

104
00:00:59,0 --> 00:00:59,0
Gadianton from

105
00:00:59,0 --> 00:00:59,0
amongst them

106
00:00:59,0 --> 00:00:59,0
insomuch that they

107
00:00:59,0 --> 00:00:59,0
have become

108
00:00:59,0 --> 00:00:59,0
extinct, and they have

109
00:00:59,0 --> 00:00:59,0
concealed their

110
00:00:59,0 --> 00:00:31,
secret plans in the earth.

111
00:00:31,0 --> 00:00:31,0
11 Now, O Lord,

112
00:00:31,0 --> 00:00:31,0
because of

113
00:00:31,0 --> 00:00:31,0
this their

114
00:00:31,0 --> 00:00:31,0
humility wilt thou

115
00:00:31,0 --> 00:00:31,0
turn away thine

116
00:00:31,0 --> 00:00:31,0
anger, and let

117
00:00:31,0 --> 00:00:31,0
thine anger be

118
00:00:31,0 --> 00:00:31,0
appeased in the

119
00:00:31,0 --> 00:00:31,0
destruction of

120
00:00:31,0 --> 00:00:31,0
those wicked men

121
00:00:31,0 --> 00:00:31,0
whom thou hast

122
00:00:31,0 --> 00:01:43,
already destroyed.

123
00:01:43,0 --> 00:01:43,0
12 O Lord,

124
00:01:43,0 --> 00:01:43,0
wilt thou turn

125
00:01:43,0 --> 00:01:43,0
away thine

126
00:01:43,0 --> 00:01:43,0
anger, yea, thy

127
00:01:43,0 --> 00:01:43,0
fierce anger, and

128
00:01:43,0 --> 00:01:43,0
cause that

129
00:01:43,0 --> 00:01:43,0
this famine may

130
00:01:43,0 --> 00:01:15,
cease in this land.

131
00:01:15,0 --> 00:01:15,0
13 O Lord,

132
00:01:15,0 --> 00:01:15,0
wilt thou

133
00:01:15,0 --> 00:01:15,0
hearken unto me,

134
00:01:15,0 --> 00:01:15,0
and cause that

135
00:01:15,0 --> 00:01:15,0
it may be

136
00:01:15,0 --> 00:01:15,0
done according

137
00:01:15,0 --> 00:01:15,0
to my words,

138
00:01:15,0 --> 00:01:15,0
and send

139
00:01:15,0 --> 00:01:15,0
forth rain upon

140
00:01:15,0 --> 00:01:15,0
the face of

141
00:01:15,0 --> 00:01:15,0
the earth, that

142
00:01:15,0 --> 00:01:15,0
she may

143
00:01:15,0 --> 00:01:15,0
bring forth her

144
00:01:15,0 --> 00:01:15,0
fruit, and her

145
00:01:15,0 --> 00:01:15,0
grain in the

146
00:01:15,0 --> 00:00:47,
season of grain.

147
00:00:47,0 --> 00:00:47,0
14 O Lord,

148
00:00:47,0 --> 00:00:47,0
thou didst

149
00:00:47,0 --> 00:00:47,0
hearken unto

150
00:00:47,0 --> 00:00:47,0
my words when

151
00:00:47,0 --> 00:00:47,0
I said, Let

152
00:00:47,0 --> 00:00:47,0
there be a

153
00:00:47,0 --> 00:00:47,0
famine, that

154
00:00:47,0 --> 00:00:47,0
the

155
00:00:47,0 --> 00:00:47,0
pestilence of the

156
00:00:47,0 --> 00:00:47,0
sword might

157
00:00:47,0 --> 00:00:47,0
cease; and I

158
00:00:47,0 --> 00:00:47,0
know that

159
00:00:47,0 --> 00:00:47,0
thou wilt,

160
00:00:47,0 --> 00:00:47,0
even at this

161
00:00:47,0 --> 00:00:47,0
time, hearken

162
00:00:47,0 --> 00:00:47,0
unto my

163
00:00:47,0 --> 00:00:47,0
words, for thou

164
00:00:47,0 --> 00:00:47,0
saidst that:

165
00:00:47,0 --> 00:00:47,0
If this

166
00:00:47,0 --> 00:00:19,
people repent I will spare them.

167
00:00:19,0 --> 00:00:19,0
15 Yea, O

168
00:00:19,0 --> 00:00:19,0
Lord, and

169
00:00:19,0 --> 00:00:19,0
thou seest

170
00:00:19,0 --> 00:00:19,0
that they

171
00:00:19,0 --> 00:00:19,0
have repented,

172
00:00:19,0 --> 00:00:19,0
because of

173
00:00:19,0 --> 00:00:19,0
the famine

174
00:00:19,0 --> 00:00:19,0
and the

175
00:00:19,0 --> 00:00:19,0
pestilence

176
00:00:19,0 --> 00:00:19,0
and

177
00:00:19,0 --> 00:00:19,0
destruction which

178
00:00:19,0 --> 00:01:17,
has come unto them.

179
00:01:17,0 --> 00:01:17,0
16 And

180
00:01:17,0 --> 00:01:17,0
now, O Lord,

181
00:01:17,0 --> 00:01:17,0
wilt thou

182
00:01:17,0 --> 00:01:17,0
turn away

183
00:01:17,0 --> 00:01:17,0
thine

184
00:01:17,0 --> 00:01:17,0
anger, and try

185
00:01:17,0 --> 00:01:17,0
again if

186
00:01:17,0 --> 00:01:17,0
they will

187
00:01:17,0 --> 00:01:17,0
serve

188
00:01:17,0 --> 00:01:17,0
thee? And if

189
00:01:17,0 --> 00:01:17,0
so, O Lord,

190
00:01:17,0 --> 00:01:17,0
thou

191
00:01:17,0 --> 00:01:17,0
canst bless

192
00:01:17,0 --> 00:01:17,0
them

193
00:01:17,0 --> 00:01:17,0
according to thy

194
00:01:17,0 --> 00:01:17,0
words

195
00:01:17,0 --> 00:00:49,
which thou hast said.

196
00:00:49,0 --> 00:00:49,0
17 And it

197
00:00:49,0 --> 00:00:49,0
came to

198
00:00:49,0 --> 00:00:49,0
pass that

199
00:00:49,0 --> 00:00:49,0
in the

200
00:00:49,0 --> 00:00:49,0
seventy

201
00:00:49,0 --> 00:00:49,0
and sixth

202
00:00:49,0 --> 00:00:49,0
year the

203
00:00:49,0 --> 00:00:49,0
Lord did

204
00:00:49,0 --> 00:00:49,0
turn away

205
00:00:49,0 --> 00:00:49,0
his anger

206
00:00:49,0 --> 00:00:49,0
from the

207
00:00:49,0 --> 00:00:49,0
people,

208
00:00:49,0 --> 00:00:49,0
and

209
00:00:49,0 --> 00:00:49,0
caused that

210
00:00:49,0 --> 00:00:49,0
rain should

211
00:00:49,0 --> 00:00:49,0
fall

212
00:00:49,0 --> 00:00:49,0
upon the

213
00:00:49,0 --> 00:00:49,0
earth,

214
00:00:49,0 --> 00:00:49,0
insomuch that

215
00:00:49,0 --> 00:00:49,0
it did

216
00:00:49,0 --> 00:00:49,0
bring forth

217
00:00:49,0 --> 00:00:49,0
her

218
00:00:49,0 --> 00:00:49,0
fruit in the

219
00:00:49,0 --> 00:00:49,0
season of

220
00:00:49,0 --> 00:00:49,0
her

221
00:00:49,0 --> 00:00:49,0
fruit. And it

222
00:00:49,0 --> 00:00:49,0
came to

223
00:00:49,0 --> 00:00:49,0
pass that

224
00:00:49,0 --> 00:00:49,0
