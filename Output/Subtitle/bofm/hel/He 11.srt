00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:37,167
Chapter 11 Nephi persuades the Lord to replace

2
00:00:37,167 --> 00:01:14,334
 their war with a famine—Many people perish—They

3
00:01:14,334 --> 00:01:51,501
 repent, and Nephi importunes the Lord for rain—Nephi

4
00:01:51,501 --> 00:02:28,668
 and Lehi receive many revelations—The Gadianton

5
00:02:28,668 --> 00:03:05,835
 robbers entrench themselves in the land. About

6
00:03:05,835 --> 00:03:43,002
 20–6 B.C.

7
00:03:43,29 --> 00:03:46,49
1 And now it came to pass in the seventy and

8
00:03:46,49 --> 00:03:49,69
 second year of the reign of the judges that the

9
00:03:49,69 --> 00:03:52,89
 contentions did increase, insomuch that there were wars

10
00:03:52,89 --> 00:03:56,09
 throughout all the land among all the people of

11
00:03:56,09 --> 00:03:59,29
 Nephi

12
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,239
2 And it was this secret band of robbers who did

13
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:07,239
 carry on this work of destruction and wickedness.

14
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:11,239
 And this war did last all that year; and in the

15
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:15,239
 seventy and third year it did also last

16
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:23,188
3 And it came to pass that in this year Nephi did

17
00:04:23,188 --> 00:04:31,188
 cry unto the Lord, saying

18
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:32,738
4 O Lord, do not suffer that this people shall be

19
00:04:32,738 --> 00:04:34,338
 destroyed by the sword; but O Lord, rather let

20
00:04:34,338 --> 00:04:35,938
 there be a famine in the land, to stir them up in

21
00:04:35,938 --> 00:04:37,538
 remembrance of the Lord their God, and perhaps they

22
00:04:37,538 --> 00:04:39,138
 will repent and turn unto thee

23
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,779
5 And so it was done, according to the words of

24
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:44,446
 Nephi. And there was a great famine upon the land,

25
00:04:44,446 --> 00:04:47,113
 among all the people of Nephi. And thus in the

26
00:04:47,113 --> 00:04:49,78
 seventy and fourth year the famine did continue, and

27
00:04:49,78 --> 00:04:52,447
 the work of destruction did cease by the sword but

28
00:04:52,447 --> 00:04:55,114
 became sore by famine

29
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:58,936
6 And this work of destruction did also continue

30
00:04:58,936 --> 00:05:02,811
 in the seventy and fifth year. For the earth was

31
00:05:02,811 --> 00:05:06,686
 smitten that it was dry, and did not yield forth

32
00:05:06,686 --> 00:05:10,561
 grain in the season of grain; and the whole earth was

33
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:14,436
 smitten, even among the Lamanites as well as

34
00:05:14,436 --> 00:05:18,311
 among the Nephites, so that they were smitten that

35
00:05:18,311 --> 00:05:22,186
 they did perish by thousands in the more wicked parts

36
00:05:22,186 --> 00:05:26,061
 of the land

37
00:05:26,96 --> 00:05:30,96
7 And it came to pass that the people saw that

38
00:05:30,96 --> 00:05:34,96
 they were about to perish by famine, and they began

39
00:05:34,96 --> 00:05:38,96
 to remember the Lord their God; and they began to

40
00:05:38,96 --> 00:05:42,96
 remember the words of Nephi

41
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:55,48
8 And the people began to plead with their chief

42
00:05:55,48 --> 00:06:08,051
 judges and their leaders, that they would say unto

43
00:06:08,051 --> 00:06:20,622
 Nephi: Behold, we know that thou art a man of God,

44
00:06:20,622 --> 00:06:33,193
 and therefore cry unto the Lord our God that he

45
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:45,764
 turn away from us this famine, lest all the words

46
00:06:45,764 --> 00:06:58,335
 which thou hast spoken concerning our destruction

47
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:10,906
 be fulfilled

48
00:07:10,63 --> 00:07:11,963
9 And it came to pass that the judges did say unto

49
00:07:11,963 --> 00:07:13,296
 Nephi, according to the words which had been

50
00:07:13,296 --> 00:07:14,629
 desired. And it came to pass that when Nephi saw that

51
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:15,962
 the people had repented and did humble themselves

52
00:07:15,962 --> 00:07:17,295
 in sackcloth, he cried again unto the Lord,

53
00:07:17,295 --> 00:07:18,628
 saying

54
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,205
10 O Lord, behold this people repenteth; and they

55
00:07:20,205 --> 00:07:21,805
 have swept away the band of Gadianton from amongst

56
00:07:21,805 --> 00:07:23,405
 them insomuch that they have become extinct, and

57
00:07:23,405 --> 00:07:25,005
 they have concealed their secret plans in the

58
00:07:25,005 --> 00:07:26,605
 earth

59
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,579
11 Now, O Lord, because of this their humility

60
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:30,579
 wilt thou turn away thine anger, and let thine anger

61
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:32,579
 be appeased in the destruction of those wicked men

62
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:34,579
 whom thou hast already destroyed

63
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:42,554
12 O Lord, wilt thou turn away thine anger, yea,

64
00:07:42,554 --> 00:07:50,554
 thy fierce anger, and cause that this famine may

65
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:58,554
 cease in this land

66
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,078
13 O Lord, wilt thou hearken unto me, and cause

67
00:08:00,078 --> 00:08:01,678
 that it may be done according to my words, and send

68
00:08:01,678 --> 00:08:03,278
 forth rain upon the face of the earth, that she

69
00:08:03,278 --> 00:08:04,878
 may bring forth her fruit, and her grain in the

70
00:08:04,878 --> 00:08:06,478
 season of grain

71
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:07,786
14 O Lord, thou didst hearken unto my words when I

72
00:08:07,786 --> 00:08:09,119
 said, Let there be a famine, that the pestilence

73
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:10,452
 of the sword might cease; and I know that thou

74
00:08:10,452 --> 00:08:11,785
 wilt, even at this time, hearken unto my words, for

75
00:08:11,785 --> 00:08:13,118
 thou saidst that: If this people repent I will

76
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:14,451
 spare them

77
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:30,427
15 Yea, O Lord, and thou seest that they have

78
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:46,427
 repented, because of the famine and the pestilence and

79
00:08:46,427 --> 00:09:02,427
 destruction which has come unto them

80
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,275
16 And now, O Lord, wilt thou turn away thine

81
00:09:04,275 --> 00:09:06,275
 anger, and try again if they will serve thee? And if

82
00:09:06,275 --> 00:09:08,275
 so, O Lord, thou canst bless them according to thy

83
00:09:08,275 --> 00:09:10,275
 words which thou hast said

84
00:09:10,25 --> 00:09:10,821
17 And it came to pass that in the seventy and

85
00:09:10,821 --> 00:09:11,392
 sixth year the Lord did turn away his anger from the

86
00:09:11,392 --> 00:09:11,963
 people, and caused that rain should fall upon the

87
00:09:11,963 --> 00:09:12,534
 earth, insomuch that it did bring forth her fruit

88
00:09:12,534 --> 00:09:13,105
 in the season of her fruit. And it came to pass

89
00:09:13,105 --> 00:09:13,676
 that it did bring forth her grain in the season of

90
00:09:13,676 --> 00:09:14,247
 her grain

91
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:22,287
18 And behold, the people did rejoice and glorify

92
00:09:22,287 --> 00:09:30,287
 God, and the whole face of the land was filled

93
00:09:30,287 --> 00:09:38,287
 with rejoicing; and they did no more seek to destroy

94
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:46,287
 Nephi, but they did esteem him as a great prophet,

95
00:09:46,287 --> 00:09:54,287
 and a man of God, having great power and

96
00:09:54,287 --> 00:10:02,287
 authority given unto him from God

97
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:02,135
19 And behold, Lehi, his brother, was not a whit

98
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:02,135
 behind him as to things pertaining to

99
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:02,135
 righteousness

100
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:12,569
20 And thus it did come to pass that the people of

101
00:10:12,569 --> 00:10:22,569
 Nephi began to prosper again in the land, and

102
00:10:22,569 --> 00:10:32,569
 began to build up their waste places, and began to

103
00:10:32,569 --> 00:10:42,569
 multiply and spread, even until they did cover the

104
00:10:42,569 --> 00:10:52,569
 whole face of the land, both on the northward and

105
00:10:52,569 --> 00:11:02,569
 on the southward, from the sea west to the sea

106
00:11:02,569 --> 00:11:12,569
 east

107
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:19,372
21 And it came to pass that the seventy and sixth

108
00:11:19,372 --> 00:11:26,372
 year did end in peace. And the seventy and seventh

109
00:11:26,372 --> 00:11:33,372
 year began in peace; and the church did spread

110
00:11:33,372 --> 00:11:40,372
 throughout the face of all the land; and the more

111
00:11:40,372 --> 00:11:47,372
 part of the people, both the Nephites and the

112
00:11:47,372 --> 00:11:54,372
 Lamanites, did belong to the church; and they did have

113
00:11:54,372 --> 00:12:01,372
 exceedingly great peace in the land; and thus ended

114
00:12:01,372 --> 00:12:08,372
 the seventy and seventh year

115
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:09,194
22 And also they had peace in the seventy and

116
00:12:09,194 --> 00:12:10,194
 eighth year, save it were a few contentions concerning

117
00:12:10,194 --> 00:12:11,194
 the points of doctrine which had been laid down

118
00:12:11,194 --> 00:12:12,194
 by the prophets

119
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,088
23 And in the seventy and ninth year there began

120
00:12:13,088 --> 00:12:13,946
 to be much strife. But it came to pass that Nephi

121
00:12:13,946 --> 00:12:14,803
 and Lehi, and many of their brethren who knew

122
00:12:14,803 --> 00:12:15,659
 concerning the true points of doctrine, having many

123
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:16,516
 revelations daily, therefore they did preach unto the

124
00:12:16,516 --> 00:12:17,374
 people, insomuch that they did put an end to

125
00:12:17,374 --> 00:12:18,231
 their strife in that same year

126
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:29,205
24 And it came to pass that in the eightieth year

127
00:12:29,205 --> 00:12:39,605
 of the reign of the judges over the people of

128
00:12:39,605 --> 00:12:50,005
 Nephi, there were a certain number of the dissenters

129
00:12:50,005 --> 00:13:00,405
 from the people of Nephi, who had some years before

130
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:10,805
 gone over unto the Lamanites, and taken upon

131
00:13:10,805 --> 00:13:21,205
 themselves the name of Lamanites, and also a certain

132
00:13:21,205 --> 00:13:31,605
 number who were real descendants of the Lamanites,

133
00:13:31,605 --> 00:13:42,005
 being stirred up to anger by them, or by those

134
00:13:42,005 --> 00:13:52,405
 dissenters, therefore they commenced a war with their

135
00:13:52,405 --> 00:14:02,805
 brethren

136
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:02,475
25 And they did commit murder and plunder; and

137
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:02,475
 then they would retreat back into the mountains, and

138
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:02,475
 into the wilderness and secret places, hiding

139
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:02,475
 themselves that they could not be discovered,

140
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:02,475
 receiving daily an addition to their numbers, inasmuch as

141
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:02,475
 there were dissenters that went forth unto them

142
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:12,542
26 And thus in time, yea, even in the space of not

143
00:14:12,542 --> 00:14:22,142
 many years, they became an exceedingly great band

144
00:14:22,142 --> 00:14:31,742
 of robbers; and they did search out all the

145
00:14:31,742 --> 00:14:41,342
 secret plans of Gadianton; and thus they became robbers

146
00:14:41,342 --> 00:14:50,942
 of Gadianton

147
00:14:50,79 --> 00:14:51,123
27 Now behold, these robbers did make great havoc,

148
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:51,456
 yea, even great destruction among the people of

149
00:14:51,456 --> 00:14:51,789
 Nephi, and also among the people of the Lamanites

150
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:58,024
28 And it came to pass that it was expedient that

151
00:14:58,024 --> 00:15:04,824
 there should be a stop put to this work of

152
00:15:04,824 --> 00:15:11,624
 destruction; therefore they sent an army of strong men

153
00:15:11,624 --> 00:15:18,424
 into the wilderness and upon the mountains to search

154
00:15:18,424 --> 00:15:25,224
 out this band of robbers, and to destroy them

155
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:28,291
29 But behold, it came to pass that in that same

156
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:31,291
 year they were driven back even into their own

157
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:34,291
 lands. And thus ended the eightieth year of the reign

158
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:37,291
 of the judges over the people of Nephi

159
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:58,786
30 And it came to pass in the commencement of the

160
00:15:58,786 --> 00:16:20,536
 eighty and first year they did go forth again

161
00:16:20,536 --> 00:16:42,286
 against this band of robbers, and did destroy many;

162
00:16:42,286 --> 00:17:04,036
 and they were also visited with much destruction

163
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:06,357
31 And they were again obliged to return out of

164
00:17:06,357 --> 00:17:07,957
 the wilderness and out of the mountains unto their

165
00:17:07,957 --> 00:17:09,557
 own lands, because of the exceeding greatness of

166
00:17:09,557 --> 00:17:11,157
 the numbers of those robbers who infested the

167
00:17:11,157 --> 00:17:12,757
 mountains and the wilderness

168
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:12,899
32 And it came to pass that thus ended this year.

169
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:13,066
 And the robbers did still increase and wax strong,

170
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:13,233
 insomuch that they did defy the whole armies of

171
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:13,4
 the Nephites, and also of the Lamanites; and they

172
00:17:13,4 --> 00:17:13,567
 did cause great fear to come unto the people upon

173
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:13,734
 all the face of the land

174
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:17,132
33 Yea, for they did visit many parts of the land,

175
00:17:17,132 --> 00:17:21,132
 and did do great destruction unto them; yea, did

176
00:17:21,132 --> 00:17:25,132
 kill many, and did carry away others captive into

177
00:17:25,132 --> 00:17:29,132
 the wilderness, yea, and more especially their

178
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:33,132
 women and their children

179
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:38,418
34 Now this great evil, which came unto the people

180
00:17:38,418 --> 00:17:43,751
 because of their iniquity, did stir them up again

181
00:17:43,751 --> 00:17:49,084
 in remembrance of the Lord their God

182
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:54,635
35 And thus ended the eighty and first year of the

183
00:17:54,635 --> 00:17:59,635
 reign of the judges

184
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:06,812
36 And in the eighty and second year they began

185
00:18:06,812 --> 00:18:14,212
 again to forget the Lord their God. And in the

186
00:18:14,212 --> 00:18:21,612
 eighty and third year they began to wax strong in

187
00:18:21,612 --> 00:18:29,012
 iniquity. And in the eighty and fourth year they did

188
00:18:29,012 --> 00:18:36,412
 not mend their ways
