dissensions. And also the prophecies of many holy prophets,

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0

records of Helaman, who was the son of Helaman,

and also according to the records of his sons,

their conversion. An account of the righteousness

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of the Lamanites, and the wickedness and

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
abominations of the Nephites, according to the record of

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Helaman and his sons, even down to the coming

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of Christ, which is called the book of Helaman,

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and so forth.Chapter 1 Pahoran the second becomes

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
chief judge and is murdered by

16
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Kishkumen—Pacumeni fills the judgment seat—Coriantumr leads the

17
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Lamanite armies, takes Zarahemla, and slays

18
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Pacumeni—Moronihah defeats the Lamanites and retakes

19
00:00:00,0 --> 00:09:09,
Zarahemla, and Coriantumr is slain. About 52–50 B.C. 

20
00:09:09,0 --> 00:09:09,0
1 And now behold, it came to pass in the

21
00:09:09,0 --> 00:09:09,0
commencement of the fortieth year of

22
00:09:09,0 --> 00:09:09,0
the reign of the judges over the people of

23
00:09:09,0 --> 00:09:09,0
Nephi, there began to be a serious

24
00:09:09,0 --> 00:17:21,
difficulty among the people of the Nephites.

25
00:17:21,0 --> 00:17:21,0
2 For behold, Pahoran had died, and

26
00:17:21,0 --> 00:17:21,0
gone the way of all the earth;

27
00:17:21,0 --> 00:17:21,0
therefore there began to be a serious

28
00:17:21,0 --> 00:17:21,0
contention concerning who should

29
00:17:21,0 --> 00:17:21,0
have the judgment-seat among the

30
00:17:21,0 --> 00:19:33,
brethren, who were the sons of Pahoran.

31
00:19:33,0 --> 00:19:33,0
3 Now these are their names who did

32
00:19:33,0 --> 00:19:33,0
contend for the judgment-seat, who

33
00:19:33,0 --> 00:19:33,0
did also cause the people to

34
00:19:33,0 --> 00:24:43,
contend: Pahoran, Paanchi, and Pacumeni.

35
00:24:43,0 --> 00:24:43,0
4 Now these are not all the

36
00:24:43,0 --> 00:24:43,0
sons of Pahoran (for he had

37
00:24:43,0 --> 00:24:43,0
many), but these are they who did

38
00:24:43,0 --> 00:24:43,0
contend for the judgment-seat;

39
00:24:43,0 --> 00:24:43,0
therefore, they did cause

40
00:24:43,0 --> 00:41:23,
three divisions among the people.

41
00:41:23,0 --> 00:41:23,0
5 Nevertheless, it came to

42
00:41:23,0 --> 00:41:23,0
pass that Pahoran was

43
00:41:23,0 --> 00:41:23,0
appointed by the voice of the

44
00:41:23,0 --> 00:41:23,0
people to be chief judge and a

45
00:41:23,0 --> 00:56:29,
governor over the people of Nephi.

46
00:56:29,0 --> 00:56:29,0
6 And it came to pass that

47
00:56:29,0 --> 00:56:29,0
Pacumeni, when he saw that

48
00:56:29,0 --> 00:56:29,0
he could not obtain the

49
00:56:29,0 --> 00:56:29,0
judgment-seat, he did unite

50
00:56:29,0 --> 00:58:41,
with the voice of the people.

51
00:58:41,0 --> 00:58:41,0
7 But behold, Paanchi,

52
00:58:41,0 --> 00:58:41,0
and that part of the people

53
00:58:41,0 --> 00:58:41,0
that were desirous that

54
00:58:41,0 --> 00:58:41,0
he should be their

55
00:58:41,0 --> 00:58:41,0
governor, was exceedingly

56
00:58:41,0 --> 00:58:41,0
wroth; therefore, he was about

57
00:58:41,0 --> 00:58:41,0
to flatter away those

58
00:58:41,0 --> 00:58:41,0
people to rise up in

59
00:58:41,0 --> 01:07:50,
rebellion against their brethren.

60
01:07:50,0 --> 01:07:50,0
8 And it came to pass

61
01:07:50,0 --> 01:07:50,0
as he was about to do

62
01:07:50,0 --> 01:07:50,0
this, behold, he was

63
01:07:50,0 --> 01:07:50,0
taken, and was tried

64
01:07:50,0 --> 01:07:50,0
according to the voice of the

65
01:07:50,0 --> 01:07:50,0
people, and condemned

66
01:07:50,0 --> 01:07:50,0
unto death; for he had

67
01:07:50,0 --> 01:07:50,0
raised up in rebellion

68
01:07:50,0 --> 01:07:50,0
and sought to destroy

69
01:07:50,0 --> 01:17:46,
the liberty of the people.

70
01:17:46,0 --> 01:17:46,0
9 Now when those

71
01:17:46,0 --> 01:17:46,0
people who were desirous

72
01:17:46,0 --> 01:17:46,0
that he should be their

73
01:17:46,0 --> 01:17:46,0
governor saw that he

74
01:17:46,0 --> 01:17:46,0
was condemned unto

75
01:17:46,0 --> 01:17:46,0
death, therefore they were

76
01:17:46,0 --> 01:17:46,0
angry, and behold,

77
01:17:46,0 --> 01:17:46,0
they sent forth one

78
01:17:46,0 --> 01:17:46,0
Kishkumen, even to the

79
01:17:46,0 --> 01:17:46,0
judgment-seat of Pahoran,

80
01:17:46,0 --> 01:17:46,0
and murdered Pahoran

81
01:17:46,0 --> 01:30:54,
as he sat upon the judgment-seat.

82
01:30:54,0 --> 01:30:54,0
10 And he was pursued

83
01:30:54,0 --> 01:30:54,0
by the servants of

84
01:30:54,0 --> 01:30:54,0
Pahoran; but behold,

85
01:30:54,0 --> 01:30:54,0
so speedy was the

86
01:30:54,0 --> 01:30:54,0
flight of Kishkumen that

87
01:30:54,0 --> 01:33:22,
no man could overtake him.

88
01:33:22,0 --> 01:33:22,0
11 And he went unto

89
01:33:22,0 --> 01:33:22,0
those that sent him,

90
01:33:22,0 --> 01:33:22,0
and they all

91
01:33:22,0 --> 01:33:22,0
entered into a covenant,

92
01:33:22,0 --> 01:33:22,0
yea, swearing by

93
01:33:22,0 --> 01:33:22,0
their everlasting Maker,

94
01:33:22,0 --> 01:33:22,0
that they would

95
01:33:22,0 --> 01:33:22,0
tell no man that

96
01:33:22,0 --> 01:45:33,
Kishkumen had murdered Pahoran.

97
01:45:33,0 --> 01:45:33,0
12 Therefore,

98
01:45:33,0 --> 01:45:33,0
Kishkumen was not

99
01:45:33,0 --> 01:45:33,0
known among the people

100
01:45:33,0 --> 01:45:33,0
of Nephi, for he

101
01:45:33,0 --> 01:45:33,0
was in disguise at

102
01:45:33,0 --> 01:45:33,0
the time that he

103
01:45:33,0 --> 01:45:33,0
murdered Pahoran.

104
01:45:33,0 --> 01:45:33,0
And Kishkumen and

105
01:45:33,0 --> 01:45:33,0
his band, who had

106
01:45:33,0 --> 01:45:33,0
covenanted with

107
01:45:33,0 --> 01:45:33,0
him, did mingle

108
01:45:33,0 --> 01:45:33,0
themselves among the

109
01:45:33,0 --> 01:45:33,0
people, in a manner

110
01:45:33,0 --> 01:45:33,0
that they all

111
01:45:33,0 --> 01:45:33,0
could not be found;

112
01:45:33,0 --> 01:45:33,0
but as many as were

113
01:45:33,0 --> 01:50:43,
found were condemned unto death.

114
01:50:43,0 --> 01:50:43,0
13 And now

115
01:50:43,0 --> 01:50:43,0
behold, Pacumeni was

116
01:50:43,0 --> 01:50:43,0
appointed,

117
01:50:43,0 --> 01:50:43,0
according to the voice of

118
01:50:43,0 --> 01:50:43,0
the people, to

119
01:50:43,0 --> 01:50:43,0
be a chief judge

120
01:50:43,0 --> 01:50:43,0
and a governor

121
01:50:43,0 --> 01:50:43,0
over the people, to

122
01:50:43,0 --> 01:50:43,0
reign in the

123
01:50:43,0 --> 01:50:43,0
stead of his brother

124
01:50:43,0 --> 01:50:43,0
Pahoran; and it

125
01:50:43,0 --> 01:50:43,0
was according to

126
01:50:43,0 --> 01:50:43,0
his right. And all

127
01:50:43,0 --> 01:50:43,0
this was done in

128
01:50:43,0 --> 01:50:43,0
the fortieth

129
01:50:43,0 --> 01:50:43,0
year of the reign of

130
01:50:43,0 --> 02:05:50,
the judges; and it had an end.

131
02:05:50,0 --> 02:05:50,0
14 And it came

132
02:05:50,0 --> 02:05:50,0
to pass in the

133
02:05:50,0 --> 02:05:50,0
forty and first

134
02:05:50,0 --> 02:05:50,0
year of the reign

135
02:05:50,0 --> 02:05:50,0
of the judges,

136
02:05:50,0 --> 02:05:50,0
that the

137
02:05:50,0 --> 02:05:50,0
Lamanites had gathered

138
02:05:50,0 --> 02:05:50,0
together an

139
02:05:50,0 --> 02:05:50,0
innumerable army of

140
02:05:50,0 --> 02:05:50,0
men, and armed

141
02:05:50,0 --> 02:05:50,0
them with swords,

142
02:05:50,0 --> 02:05:50,0
and with

143
02:05:50,0 --> 02:05:50,0
cimeters and with bows,

144
02:05:50,0 --> 02:05:50,0
and with

145
02:05:50,0 --> 02:05:50,0
arrows, and with

146
02:05:50,0 --> 02:05:50,0
head-plates, and with

147
02:05:50,0 --> 02:05:50,0
breastplates,

148
02:05:50,0 --> 02:05:50,0
and with all

149
02:05:50,0 --> 02:07:02,
manner of shields of every kind.

150
02:07:02,0 --> 02:07:02,0
15 And they

151
02:07:02,0 --> 02:07:02,0
came down again

152
02:07:02,0 --> 02:07:02,0
that they might

153
02:07:02,0 --> 02:07:02,0
pitch battle

154
02:07:02,0 --> 02:07:02,0
against the

155
02:07:02,0 --> 02:07:02,0
Nephites. And they

156
02:07:02,0 --> 02:07:02,0
were led by a man

157
02:07:02,0 --> 02:07:02,0
whose name was

158
02:07:02,0 --> 02:07:02,0
Coriantumr;

159
02:07:02,0 --> 02:07:02,0
and he was a

160
02:07:02,0 --> 02:07:02,0
descendant of

161
02:07:02,0 --> 02:07:02,0
Zarahemla; and he

162
02:07:02,0 --> 02:07:02,0
was a dissenter

163
02:07:02,0 --> 02:07:02,0
from among the

164
02:07:02,0 --> 02:07:02,0
Nephites; and he

165
02:07:02,0 --> 02:15:14,
was a large and a mighty man.

166
02:15:14,0 --> 02:15:14,0
16 Therefore,

167
02:15:14,0 --> 02:15:14,0
the king of

168
02:15:14,0 --> 02:15:14,0
the Lamanites,

169
02:15:14,0 --> 02:15:14,0
whose name was

170
02:15:14,0 --> 02:15:14,0
Tubaloth, who

171
02:15:14,0 --> 02:15:14,0
was the son of

172
02:15:14,0 --> 02:15:14,0
Ammoron,

173
02:15:14,0 --> 02:15:14,0
supposing that

174
02:15:14,0 --> 02:15:14,0
Coriantumr, being

175
02:15:14,0 --> 02:15:14,0
a mighty man,

176
02:15:14,0 --> 02:15:14,0
could stand

177
02:15:14,0 --> 02:15:14,0
against the

178
02:15:14,0 --> 02:15:14,0
Nephites, with

179
02:15:14,0 --> 02:15:14,0
his strength and

180
02:15:14,0 --> 02:15:14,0
also with his

181
02:15:14,0 --> 02:15:14,0
great wisdom,

182
02:15:14,0 --> 02:15:14,0
insomuch that

183
02:15:14,0 --> 02:15:14,0
by sending

184
02:15:14,0 --> 02:15:14,0
him forth he

185
02:15:14,0 --> 02:27:25,
should gain power over the Nephites—

186
02:27:25,0 --> 02:27:25,0
17 Therefore

187
02:27:25,0 --> 02:27:25,0
he did stir

188
02:27:25,0 --> 02:27:25,0
them up to

189
02:27:25,0 --> 02:27:25,0
anger, and he

190
02:27:25,0 --> 02:27:25,0
did gather

191
02:27:25,0 --> 02:27:25,0
together his

192
02:27:25,0 --> 02:27:25,0
armies, and he

193
02:27:25,0 --> 02:27:25,0
did appoint

194
02:27:25,0 --> 02:27:25,0
Coriantumr to be

195
02:27:25,0 --> 02:27:25,0
their

196
02:27:25,0 --> 02:27:25,0
leader, and did

197
02:27:25,0 --> 02:27:25,0
cause that they

198
02:27:25,0 --> 02:27:25,0
should march

199
02:27:25,0 --> 02:27:25,0
down to the

200
02:27:25,0 --> 02:27:25,0
land of

201
02:27:25,0 --> 02:27:25,0
Zarahemla to battle

202
02:27:25,0 --> 02:32:36,
against the Nephites.

203
02:32:36,0 --> 02:32:36,0
18 And it

204
02:32:36,0 --> 02:32:36,0
came to pass

205
02:32:36,0 --> 02:32:36,0
that because

206
02:32:36,0 --> 02:32:36,0
of so much

207
02:32:36,0 --> 02:32:36,0
contention

208
02:32:36,0 --> 02:32:36,0
and so much

209
02:32:36,0 --> 02:32:36,0
difficulty in

210
02:32:36,0 --> 02:32:36,0
the

211
02:32:36,0 --> 02:32:36,0
government, that

212
02:32:36,0 --> 02:32:36,0
they had not

213
02:32:36,0 --> 02:32:36,0
kept

214
02:32:36,0 --> 02:32:36,0
sufficient guards in

215
02:32:36,0 --> 02:32:36,0
the land of

216
02:32:36,0 --> 02:32:36,0
Zarahemla;

217
02:32:36,0 --> 02:32:36,0
for they had

218
02:32:36,0 --> 02:32:36,0
supposed

219
02:32:36,0 --> 02:32:36,0
that the

220
02:32:36,0 --> 02:32:36,0
Lamanites durst

221
02:32:36,0 --> 02:32:36,0
not come into

222
02:32:36,0 --> 02:32:36,0
the heart of

223
02:32:36,0 --> 02:32:36,0
their lands

224
02:32:36,0 --> 02:32:36,0
to attack

225
02:32:36,0 --> 02:38:47,
that great city Zarahemla.

226
02:38:47,0 --> 02:38:47,0
19 But it

227
02:38:47,0 --> 02:38:47,0
came to pass

228
02:38:47,0 --> 02:38:47,0
that

229
02:38:47,0 --> 02:38:47,0
Coriantumr did

230
02:38:47,0 --> 02:38:47,0
march forth

231
02:38:47,0 --> 02:38:47,0
at the head

232
02:38:47,0 --> 02:38:47,0
of his

233
02:38:47,0 --> 02:38:47,0
numerous host,

234
02:38:47,0 --> 02:38:47,0
and came

235
02:38:47,0 --> 02:38:47,0
upon the

236
02:38:47,0 --> 02:38:47,0
inhabitants of

237
02:38:47,0 --> 02:38:47,0
the city,

238
02:38:47,0 --> 02:38:47,0
and their

239
02:38:47,0 --> 02:38:47,0
march was

240
02:38:47,0 --> 02:38:47,0
with such

241
02:38:47,0 --> 02:38:47,0
exceedingly

242
02:38:47,0 --> 02:38:47,0
great speed

243
02:38:47,0 --> 02:38:47,0
that there

244
02:38:47,0 --> 02:38:47,0
was no time

245
02:38:47,0 --> 02:38:47,0
for the

246
02:38:47,0 --> 02:38:47,0
Nephites to

247
02:38:47,0 --> 02:56:13,
gather together their armies.

248
02:56:13,0 --> 02:56:13,0
20

249
02:56:13,0 --> 02:56:13,0
Therefore

250
02:56:13,0 --> 02:56:13,0
Coriantumr did

251
02:56:13,0 --> 02:56:13,0
cut down the

252
02:56:13,0 --> 02:56:13,0
watch by

253
02:56:13,0 --> 02:56:13,0
the

254
02:56:13,0 --> 02:56:13,0
entrance of the

255
02:56:13,0 --> 02:56:13,0
city, and

256
02:56:13,0 --> 02:56:13,0
did march

257
02:56:13,0 --> 02:56:13,0
forth with

258
02:56:13,0 --> 02:56:13,0
his whole

259
02:56:13,0 --> 02:56:13,0
army into

260
02:56:13,0 --> 02:56:13,0
the city,

261
02:56:13,0 --> 02:56:13,0
and they

262
02:56:13,0 --> 02:56:13,0
did slay

263
02:56:13,0 --> 02:56:13,0
every one

264
02:56:13,0 --> 02:56:13,0
who did

265
02:56:13,0 --> 02:56:13,0
oppose them,

266
02:56:13,0 --> 02:56:13,0
insomuch

267
02:56:13,0 --> 02:56:13,0
that they

268
02:56:13,0 --> 02:56:13,0
did take

269
02:56:13,0 --> 03:03:21,
possession of the whole city.

270
03:03:21,0 --> 03:03:21,0
21 And it

271
03:03:21,0 --> 03:03:21,0
came to

272
03:03:21,0 --> 03:03:21,0
pass that

273
03:03:21,0 --> 03:03:21,0


274
03:03:21,0 --> 03:03:21,0
Pacumeni, who was

275
03:03:21,0 --> 03:03:21,0
the

276
03:03:21,0 --> 03:03:21,0
chief judge,

277
03:03:21,0 --> 03:03:21,0
did flee

278
03:03:21,0 --> 03:03:21,0
before

279
03:03:21,0 --> 03:03:21,0
Coriantumr,

280
03:03:21,0 --> 03:03:21,0
even to

281
03:03:21,0 --> 03:03:21,0
the walls

282
03:03:21,0 --> 03:03:21,0
of the

283
03:03:21,0 --> 03:03:21,0
city. And

284
03:03:21,0 --> 03:03:21,0
it came

285
03:03:21,0 --> 03:03:21,0
to pass

286
03:03:21,0 --> 03:03:21,0
that

287
03:03:21,0 --> 03:03:21,0
Coriantumr did

288
03:03:21,0 --> 03:03:21,0
smite him

289
03:03:21,0 --> 03:03:21,0
against

290
03:03:21,0 --> 03:03:21,0
the wall,

291
03:03:21,0 --> 03:03:21,0
insomuch

292
03:03:21,0 --> 03:03:21,0
that he

293
03:03:21,0 --> 03:03:21,0
died. And

294
03:03:21,0 --> 03:06:03,
thus ended the days of Pacumeni.

295
03:06:03,0 --> 03:06:03,0
22 And

296
03:06:03,0 --> 03:06:03,0
now when

297
03:06:03,0 --> 03:06:03,0


298
03:06:03,0 --> 03:06:03,0
Coriantumr saw

299
03:06:03,0 --> 03:06:03,0
that he

300
03:06:03,0 --> 03:06:03,0
was in

301
03:06:03,0 --> 03:06:03,0
possession

302
03:06:03,0 --> 03:06:03,0
of the

303
03:06:03,0 --> 03:06:03,0
city of

304
03:06:03,0 --> 03:06:03,0


305
03:06:03,0 --> 03:06:03,0
Zarahemla, and

306
03:06:03,0 --> 03:06:03,0
saw that

307
03:06:03,0 --> 03:06:03,0
the

308
03:06:03,0 --> 03:06:03,0
Nephites had

309
03:06:03,0 --> 03:06:03,0
fled

310
03:06:03,0 --> 03:06:03,0
before

311
03:06:03,0 --> 03:06:03,0
them, and

312
03:06:03,0 --> 03:06:03,0
were

313
03:06:03,0 --> 03:06:03,0
slain, and

314
03:06:03,0 --> 03:06:03,0
were

315
03:06:03,0 --> 03:06:03,0
taken, and

316
03:06:03,0 --> 03:06:03,0
were cast

317
03:06:03,0 --> 03:06:03,0
into

318
03:06:03,0 --> 03:06:03,0
prison,

319
03:06:03,0 --> 03:06:03,0
and that

320
03:06:03,0 --> 03:06:03,0
he had

321
03:06:03,0 --> 03:06:03,0
obtained

322
03:06:03,0 --> 03:06:03,0
the

323
03:06:03,0 --> 03:06:03,0
possession of

324
03:06:03,0 --> 03:06:03,0
the

325
03:06:03,0 --> 03:06:03,0
strongest

326
03:06:03,0 --> 03:06:03,0
hold in

327
03:06:03,0 --> 03:06:03,0
all the

328
03:06:03,0 --> 03:06:03,0
land, his

329
03:06:03,0 --> 03:06:03,0
heart

330
03:06:03,0 --> 03:06:03,0
took

331
03:06:03,0 --> 03:06:03,0
courage

332
03:06:03,0 --> 03:06:03,0
insomuch

333
03:06:03,0 --> 03:06:03,0
that he was

334
03:06:03,0 --> 03:19:12,
about to go forth against all the land.

335
03:19:12,0 --> 03:19:12,0
23 And

336
03:19:12,0 --> 03:19:12,0
now he

337
03:19:12,0 --> 03:19:12,0
did not

338
03:19:12,0 --> 03:19:12,0
tarry

339
03:19:12,0 --> 03:19:12,0
in the

340
03:19:12,0 --> 03:19:12,0
land of

03:19:12,0 --> 03:19:12,0


342
03:19:12,0 --> 03:19:12,0
Zarahemla,

343
03:19:12,0 --> 03:19:12,0
but he

344
03:19:12,0 --> 03:19:12,0
did march

345
03:19:12,0 --> 03:19:12,0
forth

346
03:19:12,0 --> 03:19:12,0
with a

347

350
03:19:12,0 --> 03:19:12,0
towards the

351

352
03:19:12,0 --> 03:19:12,0
of

353
03:19:12,0 --> 03:19:12,0
Bountiful;

354
03:19:12,0 --> 03:19:12,0
for it

355
03:19:12,0 --> 03:19:12,0
was his

356
03:19:12,0 --> 03:19:12,0


357
03:19:12,0 --> 03:19:12,0
determination

358
03:19:12,0 --> 03:19:12,0
to go

359
03:19:12,0 --> 03:19:12,0
forth

360
03:19:12,0 --> 03:19:12,0
and cut

361
03:19:12,0 --> 03:19:12,0
his way

362
03:19:12,0 --> 03:19:12,0
through

363
03:19:12,0 --> 03:19:12,0

364
03:19:12,0 --> 03:19:12,0

365
03:19:12,0 --> 03:19:12,0

366
03:19:12,0 --> 03:19:12,0
he

367
03:19:12,0 --> 03:33:20,
might obtain the north parts of the land.

368
03:33:20,0 --> 03:33:20,0
24

369
03:33:20,0 --> 03:33:20,0
And,

370
03:33:20,0 --> 03:33:20,0
supposing

371
03:33:20,0 --> 03:33:20,0
that

372
03:33:20,0 --> 03:33:20,0

374
03:33:20,0 --> 03:33:20,0
greatest

375
03:33:20,0 --> 03:33:20,0
strength

376
03:33:20,0 --> 03:33:20,0
was in

377
03:33:20,0 --> 03:33:20,0
the

381
03:33:20,0 --> 03:33:20,0


382
03:33:20,0 --> 03:33:20,0
therefore he

383
03:33:20,0 --> 03:33:20,0
did

384
03:33:20,0 --> 03:33:20,0
march

406
