 according to the records of his sons, even down to

 Nephites, according to the record of Helaman and his sons,

12
00:01:32,048 --> 00:01:40,416

18
00:02:22,256 --> 00:02:30,624
 Lamanites and retakes Zarahemla, and Coriantumr is slain.

19
00:02:30,624 --> 00:02:38,992
 About 52–50 B.C.

20
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:40,693
1 And now behold, it came to pass in the

21
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:41,893
 commencement of the fortieth year of the reign of the

22
00:02:41,893 --> 00:02:43,093
 judges over the people of Nephi, there began to be a

23
00:02:43,093 --> 00:02:44,293
 serious difficulty among the people of the Nephites

24
00:02:44,293 --> 00:02:45,493


25
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:52,132
2 For behold, Pahoran had died, and gone the way

26
00:02:52,132 --> 00:02:58,532
 of all the earth; therefore there began to be a

27
00:02:58,532 --> 00:03:04,932
 serious contention concerning who should have the

28
00:03:04,932 --> 00:03:11,332
 judgment-seat among the brethren, who were the sons

29
00:03:11,332 --> 00:03:17,732
 of Pahoran

30
00:03:17,03 --> 00:03:22,363
3 Now these are their names who did contend for

31
00:03:22,363 --> 00:03:27,696
 the judgment-seat, who did also cause the people to

32
00:03:27,696 --> 00:03:33,029
 contend: Pahoran, Paanchi, and Pacumeni

33
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:44,796
4 Now these are not all the sons of Pahoran (for

34
00:03:44,796 --> 00:03:56,546
 he had many), but these are they who did contend

35
00:03:56,546 --> 00:04:08,296
 for the judgment-seat; therefore, they did cause

36
00:04:08,296 --> 00:04:20,046
 three divisions among the people

37
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:21,227
5 Nevertheless, it came to pass that Pahoran was

38
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:21,56
 appointed by the voice of the people to be chief

39
00:04:21,56 --> 00:04:21,893
 judge and a governor over the people of Nephi

40
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:24,661
6 And it came to pass that Pacumeni, when he saw

41
00:04:24,661 --> 00:04:27,994
 that he could not obtain the judgment-seat, he did

42
00:04:27,994 --> 00:04:31,327
 unite with the voice of the people

43
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:45,638
7 But behold, Paanchi, and that part of the people

44
00:04:45,638 --> 00:05:00,038
 that were desirous that he should be their

45
00:05:00,038 --> 00:05:14,438
 governor, was exceedingly wroth; therefore, he was about

46
00:05:14,438 --> 00:05:28,838
 to flatter away those people to rise up in

47
00:05:28,838 --> 00:05:43,238
 rebellion against their brethren

48
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:43,009
8 And it came to pass as he was about to do this,

49
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:43,009
 behold, he was taken, and was tried according to

50
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:43,009
 the voice of the people, and condemned unto death;

51
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:43,009
 for he had raised up in rebellion and sought to

52
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:43,009
 destroy the liberty of the people

53
00:05:43,41 --> 00:05:45,91
9 Now when those people who were desirous that he

54
00:05:45,91 --> 00:05:48,41
 should be their governor saw that he was condemned

55
00:05:48,41 --> 00:05:50,91
 unto death, therefore they were angry, and

56
00:05:50,91 --> 00:05:53,41
 behold, they sent forth one Kishkumen, even to the

57
00:05:53,41 --> 00:05:55,91
 judgment-seat of Pahoran, and murdered Pahoran as he

58
00:05:55,91 --> 00:05:58,41
 sat upon the judgment-seat

59
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:03,391
10 And he was pursued by the servants of Pahoran;

60
00:06:03,391 --> 00:06:08,391
 but behold, so speedy was the flight of Kishkumen

61
00:06:08,391 --> 00:06:13,391
 that no man could overtake him

62
00:06:13,64 --> 00:06:20,64
11 And he went unto those that sent him, and they

63
00:06:20,64 --> 00:06:27,64
 all entered into a covenant, yea, swearing by

64
00:06:27,64 --> 00:06:34,64
 their everlasting Maker, that they would tell no man

65
00:06:34,64 --> 00:06:41,64
 that Kishkumen had murdered Pahoran

66
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:47,887
12 Therefore, Kishkumen was not known among the

67
00:06:47,887 --> 00:06:54,173
 people of Nephi, for he was in disguise at the time

68
00:06:54,173 --> 00:07:00,459
 that he murdered Pahoran. And Kishkumen and his

69
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:06,745
 band, who had covenanted with him, did mingle

70
00:07:06,745 --> 00:07:13,031
 themselves among the people, in a manner that they all

71
00:07:13,031 --> 00:07:19,317
 could not be found; but as many as were found were

72
00:07:19,317 --> 00:07:25,603
 condemned unto death

73
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:31,131
13 And now behold, Pacumeni was appointed,

74
00:07:31,131 --> 00:07:36,417
 according to the voice of the people, to be a chief judge

75
00:07:36,417 --> 00:07:41,703
 and a governor over the people, to reign in the

76
00:07:41,703 --> 00:07:46,989
 stead of his brother Pahoran; and it was according

77
00:07:46,989 --> 00:07:52,275
 to his right. And all this was done in the

78
00:07:52,275 --> 00:07:57,561
 fortieth year of the reign of the judges; and it had an

79
00:07:57,561 --> 00:08:02,847
 end

80
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:08,12
14 And it came to pass in the forty and first year

81
00:08:08,12 --> 00:08:13,691
 of the reign of the judges, that the Lamanites

82
00:08:13,691 --> 00:08:19,262
 had gathered together an innumerable army of men,

83
00:08:19,262 --> 00:08:24,833
 and armed them with swords, and with cimeters and

84
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:30,404
 with bows, and with arrows, and with head-plates,

85
00:08:30,404 --> 00:08:35,975
 and with breastplates, and with all manner of

86
00:08:35,975 --> 00:08:41,546
 shields of every kind

87
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:47,288
15 And they came down again that they might pitch

88
00:08:47,288 --> 00:08:52,621
 battle against the Nephites. And they were led by

89
00:08:52,621 --> 00:08:57,954
 a man whose name was Coriantumr; and he was a

90
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:03,287
 descendant of Zarahemla; and he was a dissenter from

91
00:09:03,287 --> 00:09:08,62
 among the Nephites; and he was a large and a mighty

92
00:09:08,62 --> 00:09:13,953
 man

93
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:22,153
16 Therefore, the king of the Lamanites, whose

94
00:09:22,153 --> 00:09:31,153
 name was Tubaloth, who was the son of Ammoron,

95
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:40,153
 supposing that Coriantumr, being a mighty man, could

96
00:09:40,153 --> 00:09:49,153
 stand against the Nephites, with his strength and

97
00:09:49,153 --> 00:09:58,153
 also with his great wisdom, insomuch that by sending

98
00:09:58,153 --> 00:10:07,153
 him forth he should gain power over the Nephites

99
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:09,006
17 Therefore he did stir them up to anger, and he

100
00:10:09,006 --> 00:10:11,006
 did gather together his armies, and he did appoint

101
00:10:11,006 --> 00:10:13,006
 Coriantumr to be their leader, and did cause that

102
00:10:13,006 --> 00:10:15,006
 they should march down to the land of Zarahemla

103
00:10:15,006 --> 00:10:17,006
 to battle against the Nephites

104
00:10:17,25 --> 00:10:23,25
18 And it came to pass that because of so much

105
00:10:23,25 --> 00:10:29,25
 contention and so much difficulty in the government,

106
00:10:29,25 --> 00:10:35,25
 that they had not kept sufficient guards in the

107
00:10:35,25 --> 00:10:41,25
 land of Zarahemla; for they had supposed that the

108
00:10:41,25 --> 00:10:47,25
 Lamanites durst not come into the heart of their

109
00:10:47,25 --> 00:10:53,25
 lands to attack that great city Zarahemla

110
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:58,252
19 But it came to pass that Coriantumr did march

111
00:10:58,252 --> 00:11:03,085
 forth at the head of his numerous host, and came

112
00:11:03,085 --> 00:11:07,918
 upon the inhabitants of the city, and their march

113
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:12,751
 was with such exceedingly great speed that there was

114
00:11:12,751 --> 00:11:17,584
 no time for the Nephites to gather together their

115
00:11:17,584 --> 00:11:22,417
 armies

116
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:29,382
20 Therefore Coriantumr did cut down the watch by

117
00:11:29,382 --> 00:11:35,782
 the entrance of the city, and did march forth with

118
00:11:35,782 --> 00:11:42,182
 his whole army into the city, and they did slay

119
00:11:42,182 --> 00:11:48,582
 every one who did oppose them, insomuch that they

120
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:54,982
 did take possession of the whole city

121
00:11:54,881 --> 00:12:02,881
21 And it came to pass that Pacumeni, who was the

122
00:12:02,881 --> 00:12:10,881
 chief judge, did flee before Coriantumr, even to

123
00:12:10,881 --> 00:12:18,881
 the walls of the city. And it came to pass that

124
00:12:18,881 --> 00:12:26,881
 Coriantumr did smite him against the wall, insomuch

125
00:12:26,881 --> 00:12:34,881
 that he died. And thus ended the days of Pacumeni

126
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:45,754
22 And now when Coriantumr saw that he was in

127
00:12:45,754 --> 00:12:56,754
 possession of the city of Zarahemla, and saw that the

128
00:12:56,754 --> 00:13:07,754
 Nephites had fled before them, and were slain, and

129
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:18,754
 were taken, and were cast into prison, and that

130
00:13:18,754 --> 00:13:29,754
 he had obtained the possession of the strongest

131
00:13:29,754 --> 00:13:40,754
 hold in all the land, his heart took courage insomuch

132
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:51,754
 that he was about to go forth against all the

133
00:13:51,754 --> 00:14:02,754
 land

134
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:10,475
23 And now he did not tarry in the land of

135
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:18,475
 Zarahemla, but he did march forth with a large army, even

136
00:14:18,475 --> 00:14:26,475
 towards the city of Bountiful; for it was his

137
00:14:26,475 --> 00:14:34,475
 determination to go forth and cut his way through

138
00:14:34,475 --> 00:14:42,475
 with the sword, that he might obtain the north parts

139
00:14:42,475 --> 00:14:50,475
 of the land

140
00:14:50,323 --> 00:15:11,49
24 And, supposing that their greatest strength was

141
00:15:11,49 --> 00:15:32,657
 in the center of the land, therefore he did march

142
00:15:32,657 --> 00:15:53,824
 forth, giving them no time to assemble themselves

143
00:15:53,824 --> 00:16:14,991
 together save it were in small bodies; and in

144
00:16:14,991 --> 00:16:36,158
 this manner they did fall upon them and cut them down

145
00:16:36,158 --> 00:16:57,325
 to the earth

146
00:16:57,917 --> 00:17:07,917
25 But behold, this march of Coriantumr through

147
00:17:07,917 --> 00:17:17,917
 the center of the land gave Moronihah great

148
00:17:17,917 --> 00:17:27,917
 advantage over them, notwithstanding the greatness of the

149
00:17:27,917 --> 00:17:37,917
 number of the Nephites who were slain

150
00:17:37,79 --> 00:17:44,647
26 For behold, Moronihah had supposed that the

151
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:51,504
 Lamanites durst not come into the center of the land,

152
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:58,361
 but that they would attack the cities round about

153
00:17:58,361 --> 00:18:05,218
 in the borders as they had hitherto done;

154
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:12,075
 therefore Moronihah had caused that their strong armies

155
00:18:12,075 --> 00:18:18,932
 should maintain those parts round about by the

156
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:25,789
 borders

157
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:49,493
29 And thus he did; and he did head them before

158
00:02:49,493 --> 00:02:59,493
 they came to the land Bountiful, and gave unto them

159
00:02:59,493 --> 00:03:09,493
 battle, insomuch that they began to retreat back

160
00:03:09,493 --> 00:03:19,493
 towards the land of Zarahemla

161
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:24,166
30 And it came to pass that Moronihah did head

162
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:28,966
 them in their retreat, and did give unto them battle,

163
00:03:28,966 --> 00:03:33,766
 insomuch that it became an exceedingly bloody

164
00:03:33,766 --> 00:03:38,566
 battle; yea, many were slain, and among the number

165
00:03:38,566 --> 00:03:43,366
 who were slain Coriantumr was also found

166
00:03:43,29 --> 00:03:47,29
31 And now, behold, the Lamanites could not

167
00:03:47,29 --> 00:03:51,29
 retreat either way, neither on the north, nor on the

168
00:03:51,29 --> 00:03:55,29
 south, nor on the east, nor on the west, for they

169
00:03:55,29 --> 00:03:59,29
 were surrounded on every hand by the Nephites

170
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:04,039
32 And thus had Coriantumr plunged the Lamanites

171
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:08,839
 into the midst of the Nephites, insomuch that they

172
00:04:08,839 --> 00:04:13,639
 were in the power of the Nephites, and he himself

173
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:18,439
 was slain, and the Lamanites did yield themselves

174
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:23,239
 into the hands of the Nephites

175
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:29,163
33 And it came to pass that Moronihah took

176
00:04:29,163 --> 00:04:35,163
 possession of the city of Zarahemla again, and caused

177
00:04:35,163 --> 00:04:41,163
 that the Lamanites who had been taken prisoners

178
00:04:41,163 --> 00:04:47,163
 should depart out of the land in peace

179
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:47,087
34 And thus ended the forty and first year of the

180
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:47,087
 reign of the judges.
