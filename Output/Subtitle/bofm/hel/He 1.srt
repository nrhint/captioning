abominations of the Nephites, according to the record of

00:01:00,424 --> 00:01:04,74
chief judge and is murdered by

16
00:01:04,74 --> 00:01:09,056
Kishkumen—Pacumeni fills the judgment seat—Coriantumr leads the

17
00:01:09,056 --> 00:01:13,372
Lamanite armies, takes Zarahemla, and slays

18
00:01:13,372 --> 00:01:17,688
Pacumeni—Moronihah defeats the Lamanites and retakes

19
00:01:17,688 --> 00:01:22,149
Zarahemla, and Coriantumr is slain. About 52–50 B.C. 

20
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:26,349
1 And now behold, it came to pass in the

21
00:01:26,349 --> 00:01:30,549
commencement of the fortieth year of

22
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:34,749
the reign of the judges over the people of

23
00:01:34,749 --> 00:01:38,949
Nephi, there began to be a serious

24
00:01:38,949 --> 00:01:43,503
difficulty among the people of the Nephites.

25
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:45,836
2 For behold, Pahoran had died, and

26
00:01:45,836 --> 00:01:48,169
gone the way of all the earth;

27
00:01:48,169 --> 00:01:50,502
therefore there began to be a serious

28
00:01:50,502 --> 00:01:52,835
contention concerning who should

29
00:01:52,835 --> 00:01:55,168
have the judgment-seat among the

30
00:01:55,168 --> 00:01:57,818
brethren, who were the sons of Pahoran.

31
00:01:57,818 --> 00:02:02,568
3 Now these are their names who did

32
00:02:02,568 --> 00:02:07,318
contend for the judgment-seat, who

33
00:02:07,318 --> 00:02:12,068
did also cause the people to

34
00:02:12,068 --> 00:02:16,169
contend: Pahoran, Paanchi, and Pacumeni.

35
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:19,502
4 Now these are not all the

36
00:02:19,502 --> 00:02:22,835
sons of Pahoran (for he had

37
00:02:22,835 --> 00:02:26,168
many), but these are they who did

38
00:02:26,168 --> 00:02:29,501
contend for the judgment-seat;

39
00:02:29,501 --> 00:02:32,834
therefore, they did cause

40
00:02:32,834 --> 00:02:36,523
three divisions among the people.

41
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:40,123
5 Nevertheless, it came to

42
00:02:40,123 --> 00:02:43,723
pass that Pahoran was

43
00:02:43,723 --> 00:02:47,323
appointed by the voice of the

44
00:02:47,323 --> 00:02:50,923
people to be chief judge and a

45
00:02:50,923 --> 00:02:54,841
governor over the people of Nephi.

46
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,041
6 And it came to pass that

47
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:59,241
Pacumeni, when he saw that

48
00:02:59,241 --> 00:03:01,441
he could not obtain the

49
00:03:01,441 --> 00:03:03,641
judgment-seat, he did unite

50
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,185
with the voice of the people.

51
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,074
7 But behold, Paanchi,

52
00:03:08,074 --> 00:03:10,963
and that part of the people

53
00:03:10,963 --> 00:03:13,852
that were desirous that

54
00:03:13,852 --> 00:03:16,741
he should be their

55
00:03:16,741 --> 00:03:19,63
governor, was exceedingly

56
00:03:19,63 --> 00:03:22,519
wroth; therefore, he was about

57
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:25,408
to flatter away those

58
00:03:25,408 --> 00:03:28,297
people to rise up in

59
00:03:28,297 --> 00:03:31,511
rebellion against their brethren.

60
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:32,511
8 And it came to pass

61
00:03:32,511 --> 00:03:33,511
as he was about to do

62
00:03:33,511 --> 00:03:34,511
this, behold, he was

63
00:03:34,511 --> 00:03:35,511
taken, and was tried

64
00:03:35,511 --> 00:03:36,511
according to the voice of the

65
00:03:36,511 --> 00:03:37,511
people, and condemned

66
00:03:37,511 --> 00:03:38,511
unto death; for he had

67
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:39,511
raised up in rebellion

68
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:40,511
and sought to destroy

69
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:41,888
the liberty of the people.

70
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,471
9 Now when those

71
00:03:43,471 --> 00:03:45,054
people who were desirous

72
00:03:45,054 --> 00:03:46,637
that he should be their

73
00:03:46,637 --> 00:03:48,22
governor saw that he

74
00:03:48,22 --> 00:03:49,803
was condemned unto

75
00:03:49,803 --> 00:03:51,386
death, therefore they were

76
00:03:51,386 --> 00:03:52,969
angry, and behold,

77
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:54,552
they sent forth one

78
00:03:54,552 --> 00:03:56,135
Kishkumen, even to the

79
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:57,718
judgment-seat of Pahoran,

80
00:03:57,718 --> 00:03:59,301
and murdered Pahoran

81
00:03:59,301 --> 00:04:00,24
as he sat upon the judgment-seat.

82
00:04:00,24 --> 00:04:02,407
10 And he was pursued

83
00:04:02,407 --> 00:04:04,574
by the servants of

84
00:04:04,574 --> 00:04:06,741
Pahoran; but behold,

85
00:04:06,741 --> 00:04:08,908
so speedy was the

86
00:04:08,908 --> 00:04:11,075
flight of Kishkumen that

87
00:04:11,075 --> 00:04:13,62
no man could overtake him.

88
00:04:13,62 --> 00:04:14,731
11 And he went unto

89
00:04:14,731 --> 00:04:15,842
those that sent him,

90
00:04:15,842 --> 00:04:16,953
and they all

91
00:04:16,953 --> 00:04:18,064
entered into a covenant,

92
00:04:18,064 --> 00:04:19,175
yea, swearing by

93
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,286
their everlasting Maker,

94
00:04:20,286 --> 00:04:21,397
that they would

95
00:04:21,397 --> 00:04:22,508
tell no man that

96
00:04:22,508 --> 00:04:23,997
Kishkumen had murdered Pahoran.

97
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:24,468
12 Therefore,

98
00:04:24,468 --> 00:04:24,939
Kishkumen was not

99
00:04:24,939 --> 00:04:25,41
known among the people

100
00:04:25,41 --> 00:04:25,881
of Nephi, for he

101
00:04:25,881 --> 00:04:26,352
was in disguise at

102
00:04:26,352 --> 00:04:26,823
the time that he

103
00:04:26,823 --> 00:04:27,294
murdered Pahoran.

104
00:04:27,294 --> 00:04:27,765
And Kishkumen and

105
00:04:27,765 --> 00:04:28,236
his band, who had

106
00:04:28,236 --> 00:04:28,707
covenanted with

107
00:04:28,707 --> 00:04:29,178
him, did mingle

108
00:04:29,178 --> 00:04:29,649
themselves among the

109
00:04:29,649 --> 00:04:30,12
people, in a manner

110
00:04:30,12 --> 00:04:30,591
that they all

111
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,062
could not be found;

112
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:31,533
but as many as were

113
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:31,037
found were condemned unto death.

114
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:32,331
13 And now

115
00:04:32,331 --> 00:04:33,625
behold, Pacumeni was

116
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:34,919
appointed,

117
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:36,213
according to the voice of

118
00:04:36,213 --> 00:04:37,507
the people, to

119
00:04:37,507 --> 00:04:38,801
be a chief judge

120
00:04:38,801 --> 00:04:40,095
and a governor

121
00:04:40,095 --> 00:04:41,389
over the people, to

122
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:42,683
reign in the

123
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:43,977
stead of his brother

124
00:04:43,977 --> 00:04:45,271
Pahoran; and it

125
00:04:45,271 --> 00:04:46,565
was according to

126
00:04:46,565 --> 00:04:47,859
his right. And all

127
00:04:47,859 --> 00:04:49,153
this was done in

128
00:04:49,153 --> 00:04:50,447
the fortieth

129
00:04:50,447 --> 00:04:51,741
year of the reign of

130
00:04:51,741 --> 00:04:53,293
the judges; and it had an end.

131
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,661
14 And it came

132
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,029
to pass in the

133
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,397
forty and first

134
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:58,765
year of the reign

135
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:00,133
of the judges,

136
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,501
that the

137
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:02,869
Lamanites had gathered

138
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:04,237
together an

139
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:05,605
innumerable army of

140
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:06,973
men, and armed

141
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,341
them with swords,

142
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:09,709
and with

143
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,077
cimeters and with bows,

144
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:12,445
and with

145
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:13,813
arrows, and with

146
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,181
head-plates, and with

147
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:16,549
breastplates,

148
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:17,917
and with all

149
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:19,619
manner of shields of every kind.

150
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:20,369
15 And they

151
00:05:20,369 --> 00:05:21,119
came down again

152
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:21,869
that they might

153
00:05:21,869 --> 00:05:22,619
pitch battle

154
00:05:22,619 --> 00:05:23,369
against the

155
00:05:23,369 --> 00:05:24,119
Nephites. And they

156
00:05:24,119 --> 00:05:24,869
were led by a man

157
00:05:24,869 --> 00:05:25,619
whose name was

158
00:05:25,619 --> 00:05:26,369
Coriantumr;

159
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:27,119
and he was a

160
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:27,869
descendant of

161
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:28,619
Zarahemla; and he

162
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:29,369
was a dissenter

163
00:05:29,369 --> 00:05:30,119
from among the

164
00:05:30,119 --> 00:05:30,869
Nephites; and he

165
00:05:30,869 --> 00:05:31,965
was a large and a mighty man.

166
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:32,715
16 Therefore,

167
00:05:32,715 --> 00:05:33,465
the king of

168
00:05:33,465 --> 00:05:34,215
the Lamanites,

169
00:05:34,215 --> 00:05:34,965
whose name was

170
00:05:34,965 --> 00:05:35,715
Tubaloth, who

171
00:05:35,715 --> 00:05:36,465
was the son of

172
00:05:36,465 --> 00:05:37,215
Ammoron,

173
00:05:37,215 --> 00:05:37,965
supposing that

174
00:05:37,965 --> 00:05:38,715
Coriantumr, being

175
00:05:38,715 --> 00:05:39,465
a mighty man,

176
00:05:39,465 --> 00:05:40,215
could stand

177
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:40,965
against the

178
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:41,715
Nephites, with

179
00:05:41,715 --> 00:05:42,465
his strength and

180
00:05:42,465 --> 00:05:43,215
also with his

181
00:05:43,215 --> 00:05:43,965
great wisdom,

182
00:05:43,965 --> 00:05:44,715
insomuch that

183
00:05:44,715 --> 00:05:45,465
by sending

184
00:05:45,465 --> 00:05:46,215
him forth he

185
00:05:46,215 --> 00:05:46,246
should gain power over the Nephites—

186
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:46,364
17 Therefore

187
00:05:46,364 --> 00:05:46,482
he did stir

188
00:05:46,482 --> 00:05:46,6
them up to

189
00:05:46,6 --> 00:05:46,718
anger, and he

190
00:05:46,718 --> 00:05:46,836
did gather

191
00:05:46,836 --> 00:05:46,954
together his

192
00:05:46,954 --> 00:05:47,072
armies, and he

193
00:05:47,072 --> 00:05:47,19
did appoint

194
00:05:47,19 --> 00:05:47,308
Coriantumr to be

195
00:05:47,308 --> 00:05:47,426
their

196
00:05:47,426 --> 00:05:47,544
leader, and did

197
00:05:47,544 --> 00:05:47,662
cause that they

198
00:05:47,662 --> 00:05:47,78
should march

199
00:05:47,78 --> 00:05:47,898
down to the

200
00:05:47,898 --> 00:05:48,016
land of

201
00:05:48,016 --> 00:05:48,134
Zarahemla to battle

202
00:05:48,134 --> 00:05:48,648
against the Nephites.

203
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:48,909
18 And it

204
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:49,17
came to pass

205
00:05:49,17 --> 00:05:49,431
that because

206
00:05:49,431 --> 00:05:49,692
of so much

207
00:05:49,692 --> 00:05:49,953
contention

208
00:05:49,953 --> 00:05:50,214
and so much

209
00:05:50,214 --> 00:05:50,475
difficulty in

210
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:50,736
the

211
00:05:50,736 --> 00:05:50,997
government, that

212
00:05:50,997 --> 00:05:51,258
they had not

213
00:05:51,258 --> 00:05:51,519
kept

214
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:51,78
sufficient guards in

215
00:05:51,78 --> 00:05:52,041
the land of

216
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:52,302
Zarahemla;

217
00:05:52,302 --> 00:05:52,563
for they had

218
00:05:52,563 --> 00:05:52,824
supposed

219
00:05:52,824 --> 00:05:53,085
that the

220
00:05:53,085 --> 00:05:53,346
Lamanites durst

221
00:05:53,346 --> 00:05:53,607
not come into

222
00:05:53,607 --> 00:05:53,868
the heart of

223
00:05:53,868 --> 00:05:54,129
their lands

224
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:54,39
to attack

225
00:05:54,39 --> 00:05:54,054
that great city Zarahemla.

226
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:54,418
19 But it

227
00:05:54,418 --> 00:05:54,782
came to pass

228
00:05:54,782 --> 00:05:55,146
that

229
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:55,51
Coriantumr did

230
00:05:55,51 --> 00:05:55,874
march forth

231
00:05:55,874 --> 00:05:56,238
at the head

232
00:05:56,238 --> 00:05:56,602
of his

233
00:05:56,602 --> 00:05:56,966
numerous host,

234
00:05:56,966 --> 00:05:57,33
and came

235
00:05:57,33 --> 00:05:57,694
upon the

236
00:05:57,694 --> 00:05:58,058
inhabitants of

237
00:05:58,058 --> 00:05:58,422
the city,

238
00:05:58,422 --> 00:05:58,786
and their

239
00:05:58,786 --> 00:05:59,15
march was

240
00:05:59,15 --> 00:05:59,514
with such

241
00:05:59,514 --> 00:05:59,878
exceedingly

242
00:05:59,878 --> 00:06:00,242
great speed

243
00:06:00,242 --> 00:06:00,606
that there

244
00:06:00,606 --> 00:06:00,97
was no time

245
00:06:00,97 --> 00:06:01,334
for the

246
00:06:01,334 --> 00:06:01,698
Nephites to

247
00:06:01,698 --> 00:06:02,028
gather together their armies.

248
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:02,483
20

249
00:06:02,483 --> 00:06:02,938
Therefore

250
00:06:02,938 --> 00:06:03,393
Coriantumr did

251
00:06:03,393 --> 00:06:03,848
cut down the

252
00:06:03,848 --> 00:06:04,303
watch by

253
00:06:04,303 --> 00:06:04,758
the

254
00:06:04,758 --> 00:06:05,213
entrance of the

255
00:06:05,213 --> 00:06:05,668
city, and

256
00:06:05,668 --> 00:06:06,123
did march

257
00:06:06,123 --> 00:06:06,578
forth with

258
00:06:06,578 --> 00:06:07,033
his whole

259
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:07,488
army into

260
00:06:07,488 --> 00:06:07,943
the city,

261
00:06:07,943 --> 00:06:08,398
and they

262
00:06:08,398 --> 00:06:08,853
did slay

263
00:06:08,853 --> 00:06:09,308
every one

264
00:06:09,308 --> 00:06:09,763
who did

265
00:06:09,763 --> 00:06:10,218
oppose them,

266
00:06:10,218 --> 00:06:10,673
insomuch

267
00:06:10,673 --> 00:06:11,128
that they

268
00:06:11,128 --> 00:06:11,583
did take

269
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:12,405
possession of the whole city.

270
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:13,445
21 And it

271
00:06:13,445 --> 00:06:14,485
came to

272
00:06:14,485 --> 00:06:15,525
pass that

273
00:06:15,525 --> 00:06:16,565


274
00:06:16,565 --> 00:06:17,605
Pacumeni, who was

275
00:06:17,605 --> 00:06:18,645
the

276
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:19,685
chief judge,

277
00:06:19,685 --> 00:06:20,725
did flee

278
00:06:20,725 --> 00:06:21,765
before

279
00:06:21,765 --> 00:06:22,805
Coriantumr,

280
00:06:22,805 --> 00:06:23,845
even to

281
00:06:23,845 --> 00:06:24,885
the walls

282
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:25,925
of the

283
00:06:25,925 --> 00:06:26,965
city. And

284
00:06:26,965 --> 00:06:28,005
it came

285
00:06:28,005 --> 00:06:29,045
to pass

286
00:06:29,045 --> 00:06:30,085
that

287
00:06:30,085 --> 00:06:31,125
Coriantumr did

288
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,165
smite him

289
00:06:32,165 --> 00:06:33,205
against

290
00:06:33,205 --> 00:06:34,245
the wall,

291
00:06:34,245 --> 00:06:35,285
insomuch

292
00:06:35,285 --> 00:06:36,325
that he

293
00:06:36,325 --> 00:06:37,365
died. And

294
00:06:37,365 --> 00:06:38,698
thus ended the days of Pacumeni.

295
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:39,848
22 And

296
00:06:39,848 --> 00:06:40,998
now when

297
00:06:40,998 --> 00:06:42,148


298
00:06:42,148 --> 00:06:43,298
Coriantumr saw

299
00:06:43,298 --> 00:06:44,448
that he

300
00:06:44,448 --> 00:06:45,598
was in

301
00:06:45,598 --> 00:06:46,748
possession

302
00:06:46,748 --> 00:06:47,898
of the

303
00:06:47,898 --> 00:06:49,048
city of

304
00:06:49,048 --> 00:06:50,198


305
00:06:50,198 --> 00:06:51,348
Zarahemla, and

306
00:06:51,348 --> 00:06:52,498
saw that

307
00:06:52,498 --> 00:06:53,648
the

308
00:06:53,648 --> 00:06:54,798
Nephites had

309
00:06:54,798 --> 00:06:55,948
fled

310
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,098
before

311
00:06:57,098 --> 00:06:58,248
them, and

312
00:06:58,248 --> 00:06:59,398
were

313
00:06:59,398 --> 00:07:00,548
slain, and

314
00:07:00,548 --> 00:07:01,698

315
00:07:01,698 --> 00:07:02,848
taken, and

316
00:07:02,848 --> 00:07:03,998

317
00:07:03,998 --> 00:07:05,148
into

00:07:05,148 --> 00:07:06,298

319
00:07:06,298 --> 00:07:07,448
and that

320
00:07:07,448 --> 00:07:08,598
he had

321
00:07:08,598 --> 00:07:09,748
obtained

322
00:07:09,748 --> 00:07:10,898
the

323
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:12,048
possession of

324
00:07:12,048 --> 00:07:13,198
the

325
00:07:13,198 --> 00:07:14,348
strongest

326
00:07:14,348 --> 00:07:15,498
hold in

327
00:07:15,498 --> 00:07:16,648
all the

328
00:07:16,648 --> 00:07:17,798
land, his

329
00:07:17,798 --> 00:07:18,948
heart

330
00:07:18,948 --> 00:07:20,098
took

331
00:07:20,098 --> 00:07:21,248
courage

332
00:07:21,248 --> 00:07:22,398
insomuch

333
00:07:22,398 --> 00:07:23,548
that he was

334
00:07:23,548 --> 00:07:24,911
about to go forth against all the land.

335
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:25,366
23 And

336
00:07:25,366 --> 00:07:25,821
now he

337
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:26,276
did not

Zarahemla,

343
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:29,006
but he

344
00:07:29,006 --> 00:07:29,461
did march

345
00:07:29,461 --> 00:07:29,916

346
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:30,371

Bountiful;

354
00:07:33,556 --> 00:07:34,011
for it

355
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:34,466
was his

00:07:34,466 --> 00:07:34,921


357
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:35,376

360
00:07:36,286 --> 00:07:36,741

366
00:07:39,016 --> 00:07:39,471
he

367
00:07:39,471 --> 00:07:39,192
might obtain the north parts of the land.

368
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:39,508
24

369
00:07:39,508 --> 00:07:39,824
And,

370
00:07:39,824 --> 00:07:40,14
supposing

376
00:07:41,72 --> 00:07:42,036
was in

00:07:43,3 --> 00:07:43,616


382
00:07:43,616 --> 00:07:43,932
therefore he

383
00:07:43,932 --> 00:07:44,248
did
