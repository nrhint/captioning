00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 2 Helaman, the son of Helaman, becomes

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
chief judge—Gadianton leads the band of

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Kishkumen—Helaman’s servant slays Kishkumen, and the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:06:41,
Gadianton band flees into the wilderness. About 50–49 B.C. 

5
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
1 And it came to pass in the forty and second

6
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
year of the reign of the judges, after

7
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
Moronihah had established again peace between the

8
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
Nephites and the Lamanites, behold there was no

9
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
one to fill the judgment-seat; therefore there

10
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
began to be a contention again among the

11
00:06:41,0 --> 00:17:48,
people concerning who should fill the judgment-seat.

12
00:17:48,0 --> 00:17:48,0
2 And it came to pass that Helaman, who was

13
00:17:48,0 --> 00:17:48,0
the son of Helaman, was appointed to fill

14
00:17:48,0 --> 00:20:44,
the judgment-seat, by the voice of the people.

15
00:20:44,0 --> 00:20:44,0
3 But behold, Kishkumen, who had

16
00:20:44,0 --> 00:20:44,0
murdered Pahoran, did lay wait to destroy

17
00:20:44,0 --> 00:20:44,0
Helaman also; and he was upheld by his

18
00:20:44,0 --> 00:20:44,0
band, who had entered into a covenant

19
00:20:44,0 --> 00:20:16,
that no one should know his wickedness.

20
00:20:16,0 --> 00:20:16,0
4 For there was one Gadianton, who

21
00:20:16,0 --> 00:20:16,0
was exceedingly expert in many

22
00:20:16,0 --> 00:20:16,0
words, and also in his craft, to

23
00:20:16,0 --> 00:20:16,0
carry on the secret work of murder

24
00:20:16,0 --> 00:20:16,0
and of robbery; therefore he became

25
00:20:16,0 --> 00:21:28,
the leader of the band of Kishkumen.

26
00:21:28,0 --> 00:21:28,0
5 Therefore he did flatter them,

27
00:21:28,0 --> 00:21:28,0
and also Kishkumen, that if they

28
00:21:28,0 --> 00:21:28,0
would place him in the

29
00:21:28,0 --> 00:21:28,0
judgment-seat he would grant unto those who

30
00:21:28,0 --> 00:21:28,0
belonged to his band that they

31
00:21:28,0 --> 00:21:28,0
should be placed in power and

32
00:21:28,0 --> 00:21:28,0
authority among the people; therefore

33
00:21:28,0 --> 00:40:06,
Kishkumen sought to destroy Helaman.

34
00:40:06,0 --> 00:40:06,0
6 And it came to pass as he

35
00:40:06,0 --> 00:40:06,0
went forth towards the

36
00:40:06,0 --> 00:40:06,0
judgment-seat to destroy Helaman,

37
00:40:06,0 --> 00:40:06,0
behold one of the servants of

38
00:40:06,0 --> 00:40:06,0
Helaman, having been out by

39
00:40:06,0 --> 00:40:06,0
night, and having obtained,

40
00:40:06,0 --> 00:40:06,0
through disguise, a knowledge of

41
00:40:06,0 --> 00:40:06,0
those plans which had been

42
00:40:06,0 --> 00:47:36,
laid by this band to destroy Helaman—

43
00:47:36,0 --> 00:47:36,0
7 And it came to pass that

44
00:47:36,0 --> 00:47:36,0
he met Kishkumen, and he gave

45
00:47:36,0 --> 00:47:36,0
unto him a sign; therefore

46
00:47:36,0 --> 00:47:36,0
Kishkumen made known unto

47
00:47:36,0 --> 00:47:36,0
him the object of his desire,

48
00:47:36,0 --> 00:47:36,0
desiring that he would

49
00:47:36,0 --> 00:47:36,0
conduct him to the judgment-seat

50
00:47:36,0 --> 00:57:46,
that he might murder Helaman.

51
00:57:46,0 --> 00:57:46,0
8 And when the servant of

52
00:57:46,0 --> 00:57:46,0
Helaman had known all the

53
00:57:46,0 --> 00:57:46,0
heart of Kishkumen, and

54
00:57:46,0 --> 00:57:46,0
how that it was his object

55
00:57:46,0 --> 00:57:46,0
to murder, and also that it

56
00:57:46,0 --> 00:57:46,0
was the object of all

57
00:57:46,0 --> 00:57:46,0
those who belonged to his

58
00:57:46,0 --> 00:57:46,0
band to murder, and to rob,

59
00:57:46,0 --> 00:57:46,0
and to gain power, (and

60
00:57:46,0 --> 00:57:46,0
this was their secret plan,

61
00:57:46,0 --> 00:57:46,0
and their combination) the

62
00:57:46,0 --> 00:57:46,0
servant of Helaman said

63
00:57:46,0 --> 00:57:46,0
unto Kishkumen: Let us go

64
00:57:46,0 --> 01:02:15,
forth unto the judgment-seat.

65
01:02:15,0 --> 01:02:15,0
9 Now this did please

66
01:02:15,0 --> 01:02:15,0
Kishkumen exceedingly, for

67
01:02:15,0 --> 01:02:15,0
he did suppose that he

68
01:02:15,0 --> 01:02:15,0
should accomplish his

69
01:02:15,0 --> 01:02:15,0
design; but behold, the

70
01:02:15,0 --> 01:02:15,0
servant of Helaman, as

71
01:02:15,0 --> 01:02:15,0
they were going forth unto

72
01:02:15,0 --> 01:02:15,0
the judgment-seat, did

73
01:02:15,0 --> 01:02:15,0
stab Kishkumen even to

74
01:02:15,0 --> 01:02:15,0
the heart, that he fell

75
01:02:15,0 --> 01:02:15,0
dead without a groan. And

76
01:02:15,0 --> 01:02:15,0
he ran and told Helaman

77
01:02:15,0 --> 01:02:15,0
all the things which he

78
01:02:15,0 --> 01:11:24,
had seen, and heard, and done.

79
01:11:24,0 --> 01:11:24,0
10 And it came to

80
01:11:24,0 --> 01:11:24,0
pass that Helaman did

81
01:11:24,0 --> 01:11:24,0
send forth to take this

82
01:11:24,0 --> 01:11:24,0
band of robbers and

83
01:11:24,0 --> 01:11:24,0
secret murderers,

84
01:11:24,0 --> 01:11:24,0
that they might be

85
01:11:24,0 --> 01:30:51,
executed according to the law.

86
01:30:51,0 --> 01:30:51,0
11 But behold, when

87
01:30:51,0 --> 01:30:51,0
Gadianton had found

88
01:30:51,0 --> 01:30:51,0
that Kishkumen did

89
01:30:51,0 --> 01:30:51,0
not return he feared

90
01:30:51,0 --> 01:30:51,0
lest that he should

91
01:30:51,0 --> 01:30:51,0
be destroyed;

92
01:30:51,0 --> 01:30:51,0
therefore he caused that

93
01:30:51,0 --> 01:30:51,0
his band should

94
01:30:51,0 --> 01:30:51,0
follow him. And they took

95
01:30:51,0 --> 01:30:51,0
their flight out of

96
01:30:51,0 --> 01:30:51,0
the land, by a

97
01:30:51,0 --> 01:30:51,0
secret way, into the

98
01:30:51,0 --> 01:30:51,0
wilderness; and thus

99
01:30:51,0 --> 01:30:51,0
when Helaman sent

100
01:30:51,0 --> 01:30:51,0
forth to take them they

101
01:30:51,0 --> 01:37:59,
could nowhere be found.

102
01:37:59,0 --> 01:37:59,0
12 And more of

103
01:37:59,0 --> 01:37:59,0
this Gadianton shall

104
01:37:59,0 --> 01:37:59,0
be spoken

105
01:37:59,0 --> 01:37:59,0
hereafter. And thus ended

106
01:37:59,0 --> 01:37:59,0
the forty and

107
01:37:59,0 --> 01:37:59,0
second year of the

108
01:37:59,0 --> 01:37:59,0
reign of the judges

109
01:37:59,0 --> 01:47:09,
over the people of Nephi.

110
01:47:09,0 --> 01:47:09,0
13 And behold, in

111
01:47:09,0 --> 01:47:09,0
the end of this

112
01:47:09,0 --> 01:47:09,0
book ye shall see

113
01:47:09,0 --> 01:47:09,0
that this

114
01:47:09,0 --> 01:47:09,0
Gadianton did prove the

115
01:47:09,0 --> 01:47:09,0
overthrow, yea,

116
01:47:09,0 --> 01:47:09,0
almost the entire

117
01:47:09,0 --> 01:47:09,0
destruction of

118
01:47:09,0 --> 01:54:38,
the people of Nephi.

119
01:54:38,0 --> 01:54:38,0
14 Behold I do

120
01:54:38,0 --> 01:54:38,0
not mean the

121
01:54:38,0 --> 01:54:38,0
end of the book

122
01:54:38,0 --> 01:54:38,0
of Helaman, but

123
01:54:38,0 --> 01:54:38,0
I mean the end

124
01:54:38,0 --> 01:54:38,0
of the book of

125
01:54:38,0 --> 01:54:38,0
Nephi, from

126
01:54:38,0 --> 01:54:38,0
which I have taken

127
01:54:38,0 --> 01:54:38,0
all the

128
01:54:38,0 --> 01:59:48,
account which I have written.
