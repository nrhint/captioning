00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:10,25
Chapter 2 Helaman, the son of Helaman, becomes

2
00:00:10,25 --> 00:00:20,5
chief judge—Gadianton leads the band of

3
00:00:20,5 --> 00:00:30,75
Kishkumen—Helaman’s servant slays Kishkumen, and the

4
00:00:30,75 --> 00:00:41,341
Gadianton band flees into the wilderness. About 50–49 B.C. 

5
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:43,055
1 And it came to pass in the forty and second

6
00:00:43,055 --> 00:00:44,769
year of the reign of the judges, after

7
00:00:44,769 --> 00:00:46,483
Moronihah had established again peace between the

8
00:00:46,483 --> 00:00:48,197
Nephites and the Lamanites, behold there was no

9
00:00:48,197 --> 00:00:49,911
one to fill the judgment-seat; therefore there

10
00:00:49,911 --> 00:00:51,625
began to be a contention again among the

11
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,687
people concerning who should fill the judgment-seat.

12
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:58,354
2 And it came to pass that Helaman, who was

13
00:00:58,354 --> 00:01:03,021
the son of Helaman, was appointed to fill

14
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:07,968
the judgment-seat, by the voice of the people.

15
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:09,568
3 But behold, Kishkumen, who had

16
00:01:09,568 --> 00:01:11,168
murdered Pahoran, did lay wait to destroy

17
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,768
Helaman also; and he was upheld by his

18
00:01:12,768 --> 00:01:14,368
band, who had entered into a covenant

19
00:01:14,368 --> 00:01:15,475
that no one should know his wickedness.

20
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:16,142
4 For there was one Gadianton, who

21
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:16,809
was exceedingly expert in many

22
00:01:16,809 --> 00:01:17,476
words, and also in his craft, to

23
00:01:17,476 --> 00:01:18,143
carry on the secret work of murder

24
00:01:18,143 --> 00:01:18,81
and of robbery; therefore he became

25
00:01:18,81 --> 00:01:19,88
the leader of the band of Kishkumen.

26
00:01:19,88 --> 00:01:21,005
5 Therefore he did flatter them,

27
00:01:21,005 --> 00:01:22,13
and also Kishkumen, that if they

28
00:01:22,13 --> 00:01:23,255
would place him in the

29
00:01:23,255 --> 00:01:24,38
judgment-seat he would grant unto those who

30
00:01:24,38 --> 00:01:25,505
belonged to his band that they

31
00:01:25,505 --> 00:01:26,63
should be placed in power and

32
00:01:26,63 --> 00:01:27,755
authority among the people; therefore

33
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:28,322
Kishkumen sought to destroy Helaman.

34
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:29,1
6 And it came to pass as he

35
00:01:29,1 --> 00:01:29,878
went forth towards the

36
00:01:29,878 --> 00:01:30,656
judgment-seat to destroy Helaman,

37
00:01:30,656 --> 00:01:31,434
behold one of the servants of

38
00:01:31,434 --> 00:01:32,212
Helaman, having been out by

39
00:01:32,212 --> 00:01:32,99
night, and having obtained,

40
00:01:32,99 --> 00:01:33,768
through disguise, a knowledge of

41
00:01:33,768 --> 00:01:34,546
those plans which had been

42
00:01:34,546 --> 00:01:35,362
laid by this band to destroy Helaman—

43
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:38,362
7 And it came to pass that

44
00:01:38,362 --> 00:01:41,362
he met Kishkumen, and he gave

45
00:01:41,362 --> 00:01:44,362
unto him a sign; therefore

46
00:01:44,362 --> 00:01:47,362
Kishkumen made known unto

47
00:01:47,362 --> 00:01:50,362
him the object of his desire,

48
00:01:50,362 --> 00:01:53,362
desiring that he would

49
00:01:53,362 --> 00:01:56,362
conduct him to the judgment-seat

50
00:01:56,362 --> 00:01:59,72
that he might murder Helaman.

51
00:01:59,72 --> 00:02:01,077
8 And when the servant of

52
00:02:01,077 --> 00:02:02,434
Helaman had known all the

53
00:02:02,434 --> 00:02:03,791
heart of Kishkumen, and

54
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,148
how that it was his object

55
00:02:05,148 --> 00:02:06,505
to murder, and also that it

56
00:02:06,505 --> 00:02:07,862
was the object of all

57
00:02:07,862 --> 00:02:09,219
those who belonged to his

58
00:02:09,219 --> 00:02:10,576
band to murder, and to rob,

59
00:02:10,576 --> 00:02:11,933
and to gain power, (and

60
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:13,29
this was their secret plan,

61
00:02:13,29 --> 00:02:14,647
and their combination) the

62
00:02:14,647 --> 00:02:16,004
servant of Helaman said

63
00:02:16,004 --> 00:02:17,361
unto Kishkumen: Let us go

64
00:02:17,361 --> 00:02:18,038
forth unto the judgment-seat.

65
00:02:18,038 --> 00:02:18,895
9 Now this did please

66
00:02:18,895 --> 00:02:19,752
Kishkumen exceedingly, for

67
00:02:19,752 --> 00:02:20,609
he did suppose that he

68
00:02:20,609 --> 00:02:21,466
should accomplish his

69
00:02:21,466 --> 00:02:22,323
design; but behold, the

70
00:02:22,323 --> 00:02:23,18
servant of Helaman, as

71
00:02:23,18 --> 00:02:24,037
they were going forth unto

72
00:02:24,037 --> 00:02:24,894
the judgment-seat, did

73
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:25,751
stab Kishkumen even to

74
00:02:25,751 --> 00:02:26,608
the heart, that he fell

75
00:02:26,608 --> 00:02:27,465
dead without a groan. And

76
00:02:27,465 --> 00:02:28,322
he ran and told Helaman

77
00:02:28,322 --> 00:02:29,179
all the things which he

78
00:02:29,179 --> 00:02:30,417
had seen, and heard, and done.

79
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:31,417
10 And it came to

80
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:32,417
pass that Helaman did

81
00:02:32,417 --> 00:02:33,417
send forth to take this

82
00:02:33,417 --> 00:02:34,417
band of robbers and

83
00:02:34,417 --> 00:02:35,417
secret murderers,

84
00:02:35,417 --> 00:02:36,417
that they might be

85
00:02:36,417 --> 00:02:37,457
executed according to the law.

86
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:38,332
11 But behold, when

87
00:02:38,332 --> 00:02:39,207
Gadianton had found

88
00:02:39,207 --> 00:02:40,082
that Kishkumen did

89
00:02:40,082 --> 00:02:40,957
not return he feared

90
00:02:40,957 --> 00:02:41,832
lest that he should

91
00:02:41,832 --> 00:02:42,707
be destroyed;

92
00:02:42,707 --> 00:02:43,582
therefore he caused that

93
00:02:43,582 --> 00:02:44,457
his band should

94
00:02:44,457 --> 00:02:45,332
follow him. And they took

95
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:46,207
their flight out of

96
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,082
the land, by a

97
00:02:47,082 --> 00:02:47,957
secret way, into the

98
00:02:47,957 --> 00:02:48,832
wilderness; and thus

99
00:02:48,832 --> 00:02:49,707
when Helaman sent

100
00:02:49,707 --> 00:02:50,582
forth to take them they

101
00:02:50,582 --> 00:02:51,738
could nowhere be found.

102
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:52,738
12 And more of

103
00:02:52,738 --> 00:02:53,738
this Gadianton shall

104
00:02:53,738 --> 00:02:54,738
be spoken

105
00:02:54,738 --> 00:02:55,738
hereafter. And thus ended

106
00:02:55,738 --> 00:02:56,738
the forty and

107
00:02:56,738 --> 00:02:57,738
second year of the

108
00:02:57,738 --> 00:02:58,738
reign of the judges

109
00:02:58,738 --> 00:02:59,713
over the people of Nephi.

110
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:03,046
13 And behold, in

111
00:03:03,046 --> 00:03:06,379
the end of this

112
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:09,712
book ye shall see

113
00:03:09,712 --> 00:03:13,045
that this

114
00:03:13,045 --> 00:03:16,378
Gadianton did prove the

115
00:03:16,378 --> 00:03:19,711
overthrow, yea,

116
00:03:19,711 --> 00:03:23,044
almost the entire

117
00:03:23,044 --> 00:03:26,377
destruction of

118
00:03:26,377 --> 00:03:29,943
the people of Nephi.

119
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:30,743
14 Behold I do

120
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:31,543
not mean the

121
00:03:31,543 --> 00:03:32,343
end of the book

122
00:03:32,343 --> 00:03:33,143
of Helaman, but

123
00:03:33,143 --> 00:03:33,943
I mean the end

124
00:03:33,943 --> 00:03:34,743
of the book of

125
00:03:34,743 --> 00:03:35,543
Nephi, from

126
00:03:35,543 --> 00:03:36,343
which I have taken

127
00:03:36,343 --> 00:03:37,143
all the

128
00:03:37,143 --> 00:03:37,451
account which I have written.
