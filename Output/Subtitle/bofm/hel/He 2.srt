00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:21,75
Chapter 2 Helaman, the son of Helaman, becomes

2
00:00:21,75 --> 00:00:43,5
 chief judge—Gadianton leads the band of

3
00:00:43,5 --> 00:01:05,25
 Kishkumen—Helaman’s servant slays Kishkumen, and the Gadianton

4
00:01:05,25 --> 00:01:27,0
 band flees into the wilderness. About 50–49 B.C.

5
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:30,007
1 And it came to pass in the forty and second year

6
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:32,293
 of the reign of the judges, after Moronihah had

7
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:34,579
 established again peace between the Nephites and

8
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:36,865
 the Lamanites, behold there was no one to fill the

9
00:01:36,865 --> 00:01:39,151
 judgment-seat; therefore there began to be a

10
00:01:39,151 --> 00:01:41,437
 contention again among the people concerning who should

11
00:01:41,437 --> 00:01:43,723
 fill the judgment-seat

12
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:44,003
2 And it came to pass that Helaman, who was the

13
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:44,336
 son of Helaman, was appointed to fill the

14
00:01:44,336 --> 00:01:44,669
 judgment-seat, by the voice of the people

15
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:48,604
3 But behold, Kishkumen, who had murdered Pahoran,

16
00:01:48,604 --> 00:01:53,104
 did lay wait to destroy Helaman also; and he was

17
00:01:53,104 --> 00:01:57,604
 upheld by his band, who had entered into a

18
00:01:57,604 --> 00:02:02,104
 covenant that no one should know his wickedness

19
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:09,856
4 For there was one Gadianton, who was exceedingly

20
00:02:09,856 --> 00:02:16,856
 expert in many words, and also in his craft, to

21
00:02:16,856 --> 00:02:23,856
 carry on the secret work of murder and of robbery;

22
00:02:23,856 --> 00:02:30,856
 therefore he became the leader of the band of

23
00:02:30,856 --> 00:02:37,856
 Kishkumen

24
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:41,69
5 Therefore he did flatter them, and also

25
00:02:41,69 --> 00:02:46,023
 Kishkumen, that if they would place him in the

26
00:02:46,023 --> 00:02:50,356
 judgment-seat he would grant unto those who belonged to his

27
00:02:50,356 --> 00:02:54,689
 band that they should be placed in power and

28
00:02:54,689 --> 00:02:59,022
 authority among the people; therefore Kishkumen sought

29
00:02:59,022 --> 00:03:03,355
 to destroy Helaman

30
00:03:03,25 --> 00:03:08,917
6 And it came to pass as he went forth towards the

31
00:03:08,917 --> 00:03:14,584
 judgment-seat to destroy Helaman, behold one of

32
00:03:14,584 --> 00:03:20,251
 the servants of Helaman, having been out by night,

33
00:03:20,251 --> 00:03:25,918
 and having obtained, through disguise, a knowledge

34
00:03:25,918 --> 00:03:31,585
 of those plans which had been laid by this band

35
00:03:31,585 --> 00:03:37,252
 to destroy Helaman

36
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:42,951
7 And it came to pass that he met Kishkumen, and

37
00:03:42,951 --> 00:03:48,151
 he gave unto him a sign; therefore Kishkumen made

38
00:03:48,151 --> 00:03:53,351
 known unto him the object of his desire, desiring

39
00:03:53,351 --> 00:03:58,551
 that he would conduct him to the judgment-seat that

40
00:03:58,551 --> 00:04:03,751
 he might murder Helaman

41
00:04:03,81 --> 00:04:09,435
8 And when the servant of Helaman had known all

42
00:04:09,435 --> 00:04:15,06
 the heart of Kishkumen, and how that it was his

43
00:04:15,06 --> 00:04:20,685
 object to murder, and also that it was the object of

44
00:04:20,685 --> 00:04:26,31
 all those who belonged to his band to murder, and

45
00:04:26,31 --> 00:04:31,935
 to rob, and to gain power, (and this was their

46
00:04:31,935 --> 00:04:37,56
 secret plan, and their combination) the servant of

47
00:04:37,56 --> 00:04:43,185
 Helaman said unto Kishkumen: Let us go forth unto the

48
00:04:43,185 --> 00:04:48,81
 judgment-seat

49
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:55,145
9 Now this did please Kishkumen exceedingly, for

50
00:04:55,145 --> 00:05:02,002
 he did suppose that he should accomplish his

51
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:08,859
 design; but behold, the servant of Helaman, as they were

52
00:05:08,859 --> 00:05:15,716
 going forth unto the judgment-seat, did stab

53
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:22,573
 Kishkumen even to the heart, that he fell dead without

54
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:29,43
 a groan. And he ran and told Helaman all the

55
00:05:29,43 --> 00:05:36,287
 things which he had seen, and heard, and done

56
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:59,919
10 And it came to pass that Helaman did send forth

57
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:23,669
 to take this band of robbers and secret

58
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:47,419
 murderers, that they might be executed according to the

59
00:06:47,419 --> 00:07:11,169
 law

60
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:13,008
11 But behold, when Gadianton had found that

61
00:07:13,008 --> 00:07:14,151
 Kishkumen did not return he feared lest that he should

62
00:07:14,151 --> 00:07:15,294
 be destroyed; therefore he caused that his band

63
00:07:15,294 --> 00:07:16,437
 should follow him. And they took their flight out of

64
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:17,58
 the land, by a secret way, into the wilderness;

65
00:07:17,58 --> 00:07:18,723
 and thus when Helaman sent forth to take them they

66
00:07:18,723 --> 00:07:19,866
 could nowhere be found

67
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,839
12 And more of this Gadianton shall be spoken

68
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:23,839
 hereafter. And thus ended the forty and second year of

69
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:25,839
 the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi

70
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:27,839
