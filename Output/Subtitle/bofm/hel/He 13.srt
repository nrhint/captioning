1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:02,857
The prophecy of Samuel, the Lamanite, to the

2
00:00:02,857 --> 00:00:05,714
Nephites. Comprising chapters 13 through 15.Chapter

3
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:08,571
13 Samuel the Lamanite prophesies the

4
00:00:08,571 --> 00:00:11,428
destruction of the Nephites unless they repent—They and

5
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:14,285
their riches are cursed—They reject and stone the

6
00:00:14,285 --> 00:00:17,142
prophets, are encircled about by demons, and

7
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:20,354
seek for happiness in doing iniquity. About 6 B.C. 

8
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:26,354
1 And now it came to pass in the eighty and

9
00:00:26,354 --> 00:00:32,354
sixth year, the Nephites did still remain in

10
00:00:32,354 --> 00:00:38,354
wickedness, yea, in great wickedness, while the

11
00:00:38,354 --> 00:00:44,354
Lamanites did observe strictly to keep the

12
00:00:44,354 --> 00:00:50,584
commandments of God, according to the law of Moses.

13
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:52,87
2 And it came to pass that in this year

14
00:00:52,87 --> 00:00:55,156
there was one Samuel, a Lamanite, came

15
00:00:55,156 --> 00:00:57,442
into the land of Zarahemla, and began to

16
00:00:57,442 --> 00:00:59,728
preach unto the people. And it came to pass

17
00:00:59,728 --> 00:01:02,014
that he did preach, many days, repentance

18
00:01:02,014 --> 00:01:04,3
unto the people, and they did cast him

19
00:01:04,3 --> 00:01:06,066
out, and he was about to return to his own land.

20
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:05,816
3 But behold, the voice of the Lord

21
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:05,566
came unto him, that he should return

22
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:05,316
again, and prophesy unto the people

23
00:01:05,316 --> 00:01:05,132
whatsoever things should come into his heart.

24
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:05,382
4 And it came to pass that they

25
00:01:05,382 --> 00:01:05,632
would not suffer that he should

26
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:05,882
enter into the city; therefore he

27
00:01:05,882 --> 00:01:06,132
went and got upon the wall

28
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:06,382
thereof, and stretched forth his hand

29
00:01:06,382 --> 00:01:06,632
and cried with a loud voice, and

30
00:01:06,632 --> 00:01:06,882
prophesied unto the people

31
00:01:06,882 --> 00:01:07,534
whatsoever things the Lord put into his heart.

32
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:09,934
5 And he said unto them: Behold,

33
00:01:09,934 --> 00:01:12,334
I, Samuel, a Lamanite, do speak

34
00:01:12,334 --> 00:01:14,734
the words of the Lord which he

35
00:01:14,734 --> 00:01:17,134
doth put into my heart; and

36
00:01:17,134 --> 00:01:19,534
behold he hath put it into my heart

37
00:01:19,534 --> 00:01:21,934
to say unto this people that the

38
00:01:21,934 --> 00:01:24,334
sword of justice hangeth over

39
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,734
this people; and four hundred

40
00:01:26,734 --> 00:01:29,134
years pass not away save the sword

41
00:01:29,134 --> 00:01:31,925
of justice falleth upon this people.

42
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:32,258
6 Yea, heavy destruction

43
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:32,591
awaiteth this people, and it surely

44
00:01:32,591 --> 00:01:32,924
cometh unto this people, and

45
00:01:32,924 --> 00:01:33,257
nothing can save this people

46
00:01:33,257 --> 00:01:33,59
save it be repentance and faith

47
00:01:33,59 --> 00:01:33,923
on the Lord Jesus Christ, who

48
00:01:33,923 --> 00:01:34,256
surely shall come into the

49
00:01:34,256 --> 00:01:34,589
world, and shall suffer many

50
00:01:34,589 --> 00:01:34,328
things and shall be slain for his people.

51
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:38,328
7 And behold, an angel of the

52
00:01:38,328 --> 00:01:42,328
Lord hath declared it unto

53
00:01:42,328 --> 00:01:46,328
me, and he did bring glad

54
00:01:46,328 --> 00:01:50,328
tidings to my soul. And behold, I

55
00:01:50,328 --> 00:01:54,328
was sent unto you to declare

56
00:01:54,328 --> 00:01:58,328
it unto you also, that ye

57
00:01:58,328 --> 00:02:02,328
might have glad tidings; but

58
00:02:02,328 --> 00:02:06,693
behold ye would not receive me.

59
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:07,966
8 Therefore, thus saith

60
00:02:07,966 --> 00:02:09,239
the Lord: Because of the

61
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:10,512
hardness of the hearts of the

62
00:02:10,512 --> 00:02:11,785
people of the Nephites,

63
00:02:11,785 --> 00:02:13,058
except they repent I will

64
00:02:13,058 --> 00:02:14,331
take away my word from

65
00:02:14,331 --> 00:02:15,604
them, and I will withdraw my

66
00:02:15,604 --> 00:02:16,877
Spirit from them, and I

67
00:02:16,877 --> 00:02:18,15
will suffer them no longer,

68
00:02:18,15 --> 00:02:19,423
and I will turn the hearts

69
00:02:19,423 --> 00:02:20,974
of their brethren against them.

70
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:25,403
9 And four hundred

71
00:02:25,403 --> 00:02:29,832
years shall not pass away

72
00:02:29,832 --> 00:02:34,261
before I will cause that

73
00:02:34,261 --> 00:02:38,69
they shall be smitten;

74
00:02:38,69 --> 00:02:43,119
yea, I will visit them

75
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:47,548
with the sword and

76
00:02:47,548 --> 00:02:51,938
with famine and with pestilence.

77
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:52,4
10 Yea, I will visit

78
00:02:52,4 --> 00:02:52,862
them in my fierce

79
00:02:52,862 --> 00:02:53,324
anger, and there shall be

80
00:02:53,324 --> 00:02:53,786
those of the fourth

81
00:02:53,786 --> 00:02:54,248
generation who shall

82
00:02:54,248 --> 00:02:54,71
live, of your enemies, to

83
00:02:54,71 --> 00:02:55,172
behold your utter

84
00:02:55,172 --> 00:02:55,634
destruction; and this

85
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:56,096
shall surely come except

86
00:02:56,096 --> 00:02:56,558
ye repent, saith the

87
00:02:56,558 --> 00:02:57,02
Lord; and those of the

88
00:02:57,02 --> 00:02:57,482
fourth generation shall

89
00:02:57,482 --> 00:02:57,811
visit your destruction.

90
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:58,511
11 But if ye will

91
00:02:58,511 --> 00:02:59,211
repent and return unto

92
00:02:59,211 --> 00:02:59,911
the Lord your God I

93
00:02:59,911 --> 00:03:00,611
will turn away mine

94
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:01,311
anger, saith the Lord;

95
00:03:01,311 --> 00:03:02,011
yea, thus saith the

96
00:03:02,011 --> 00:03:02,711
Lord, blessed are they

97
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:03,411
who will repent and

98
00:03:03,411 --> 00:03:04,111
turn unto me, but wo

99
00:03:04,111 --> 00:03:04,818
unto him that repenteth not.

100
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:05,151
12 Yea, wo unto this

101
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:05,484
great city of

102
00:03:05,484 --> 00:03:05,817
Zarahemla; for behold, it

103
00:03:05,817 --> 00:03:06,15
is because of those

104
00:03:06,15 --> 00:03:06,483
who are righteous

105
00:03:06,483 --> 00:03:06,816
that it is saved;

106
00:03:06,816 --> 00:03:07,149
yea, wo unto this great

107
00:03:07,149 --> 00:03:07,482
city, for I

108
00:03:07,482 --> 00:03:07,815
perceive, saith the Lord,

109
00:03:07,815 --> 00:03:08,148
that there are many,

110
00:03:08,148 --> 00:03:08,481
yea, even the more

111
00:03:08,481 --> 00:03:08,814
part of this great

112
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:09,147
city, that will harden

113
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:09,48
their hearts

114
00:03:09,48 --> 00:03:09,222
against me, saith the Lord.

115
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:10,313
13 But blessed are

116
00:03:10,313 --> 00:03:11,404
they who will

117
00:03:11,404 --> 00:03:12,495
repent, for them will I

118
00:03:12,495 --> 00:03:13,586
spare. But behold,

119
00:03:13,586 --> 00:03:14,677
if it were not for

120
00:03:14,677 --> 00:03:15,768
the righteous who

121
00:03:15,768 --> 00:03:16,859
are in this great

122
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:17,95
city, behold, I would

123
00:03:17,95 --> 00:03:19,041
cause that fire

124
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:20,132
should come down out

125
00:03:20,132 --> 00:03:21,601
of heaven and destroy it.

126
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:22,476
14 But behold, it

127
00:03:22,476 --> 00:03:23,351
is for the

128
00:03:23,351 --> 00:03:24,226
righteous’ sake that it

129
00:03:24,226 --> 00:03:25,101
is spared. But

130
00:03:25,101 --> 00:03:25,976
behold, the time

131
00:03:25,976 --> 00:03:26,851
cometh, saith the Lord,

132
00:03:26,851 --> 00:03:27,726
that when ye

133
00:03:27,726 --> 00:03:28,601
shall cast out the

134
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:29,476
righteous from among

135
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:30,351
you, then shall ye

136
00:03:30,351 --> 00:03:31,226
be ripe for

137
00:03:31,226 --> 00:03:32,101
destruction; yea, wo be

138
00:03:32,101 --> 00:03:32,976
unto this great

139
00:03:32,976 --> 00:03:33,851
city, because of

140
00:03:33,851 --> 00:03:34,726
the wickedness and

141
00:03:34,726 --> 00:03:35,882
abominations which are in her.

142
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,049
15 Yea, and wo

143
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:40,216
be unto the city

144
00:03:40,216 --> 00:03:42,383
of Gideon, for

145
00:03:42,383 --> 00:03:44,55
the wickedness

146
00:03:44,55 --> 00:03:46,717
and abominations

147
00:03:46,717 --> 00:03:48,228
which are in her.

148
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:48,41
16 Yea, and wo

149
00:03:48,41 --> 00:03:48,592
be unto all the

150
00:03:48,592 --> 00:03:48,774
cities which

151
00:03:48,774 --> 00:03:48,956
are in the land

152
00:03:48,956 --> 00:03:49,138
round about,

153
00:03:49,138 --> 00:03:49,32
which are

154
00:03:49,32 --> 00:03:49,502
possessed by the

155
00:03:49,502 --> 00:03:49,684
Nephites, because of

156
00:03:49,684 --> 00:03:49,866
the wickedness

157
00:03:49,866 --> 00:03:50,048
and

158
00:03:50,048 --> 00:03:50,63
abominations which are in them.

159
00:03:50,63 --> 00:03:50,553
17 And behold,

160
00:03:50,553 --> 00:03:50,476
a curse shall

161
00:03:50,476 --> 00:03:50,399
come upon the

162
00:03:50,399 --> 00:03:50,322
land, saith

163
00:03:50,322 --> 00:03:50,245
the Lord of

164
00:03:50,245 --> 00:03:50,168
Hosts, because of

165
00:03:50,168 --> 00:03:50,091
the people’s

166
00:03:50,091 --> 00:03:50,014
sake who are

167
00:03:50,014 --> 00:03:49,937
upon the land,

168
00:03:49,937 --> 00:03:49,86
yea, because

169
00:03:49,86 --> 00:03:49,783
of their

170
00:03:49,783 --> 00:03:49,706
wickedness and their

171
00:03:49,706 --> 00:03:49,696
abominations.

172
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:50,591
18 And it

173
00:03:50,591 --> 00:03:51,486
shall come to

174
00:03:51,486 --> 00:03:52,381
pass, saith the

175
00:03:52,381 --> 00:03:53,276
Lord of

176
00:03:53,276 --> 00:03:54,171
Hosts, yea, our

177
00:03:54,171 --> 00:03:55,066
great and true

178
00:03:55,066 --> 00:03:55,961
God, that

179
00:03:55,961 --> 00:03:56,856
whoso shall

180
00:03:56,856 --> 00:03:57,751
hide up

181
00:03:57,751 --> 00:03:58,646
treasures in the

182
00:03:58,646 --> 00:03:59,541
earth shall find

183
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:00,436
them again no

184
00:04:00,436 --> 00:04:01,331
more,

185
00:04:01,331 --> 00:04:02,226
because of the

186
00:04:02,226 --> 00:04:03,121
great curse of

187
00:04:03,121 --> 00:04:04,016
the land, save

188
00:04:04,016 --> 00:04:04,911
he be a

189
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:05,806
righteous man and

190
00:04:05,806 --> 00:04:06,113
shall hide it up unto the Lord.

191
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:06,434
19 For I

192
00:04:06,434 --> 00:04:06,755
will, saith the

193
00:04:06,755 --> 00:04:07,076
Lord, that

194
00:04:07,076 --> 00:04:07,397
they shall

195
00:04:07,397 --> 00:04:07,718
