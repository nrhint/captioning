00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:20,429
The prophecy of Samuel, the Lamanite, to the

2
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:40,858
 Nephites. Comprising chapters 13 through 15.Chapter 13

3
00:00:40,858 --> 00:01:01,287
 Samuel the Lamanite prophesies the destruction of

4
00:01:01,287 --> 00:01:21,716
 the Nephites unless they repent—They and their

5
00:01:21,716 --> 00:01:42,145
 riches are cursed—They reject and stone the prophets,

6
00:01:42,145 --> 00:02:02,574
 are encircled about by demons, and seek for

7
00:02:02,574 --> 00:02:23,003
 happiness in doing iniquity. About 6 B.C.

8
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,143
1 And now it came to pass in the eighty and sixth

9
00:02:25,143 --> 00:02:26,743
 year, the Nephites did still remain in wickedness,

10
00:02:26,743 --> 00:02:28,343
 yea, in great wickedness, while the Lamanites did

11
00:02:28,343 --> 00:02:29,943
 observe strictly to keep the commandments of God,

12
00:02:29,943 --> 00:02:31,543
 according to the law of Moses

13
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:32,851
2 And it came to pass that in this year there was

14
00:02:32,851 --> 00:02:34,184
 one Samuel, a Lamanite, came into the land of

15
00:02:34,184 --> 00:02:35,517
 Zarahemla, and began to preach unto the people. And it

16
00:02:35,517 --> 00:02:36,85
 came to pass that he did preach, many days,

17
00:02:36,85 --> 00:02:38,183
 repentance unto the people, and they did cast him out,

18
00:02:38,183 --> 00:02:39,516
 and he was about to return to his own land

19
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:51,493
3 But behold, the voice of the Lord came unto him,

20
00:02:51,493 --> 00:03:03,493
 that he should return again, and prophesy unto

21
00:03:03,493 --> 00:03:15,493
 the people whatsoever things should come into his

22
00:03:15,493 --> 00:03:27,493
 heart

23
00:03:27,34 --> 00:03:45,84
4 And it came to pass that they would not suffer

24
00:03:45,84 --> 00:04:04,34
 that he should enter into the city; therefore he

25
00:04:04,34 --> 00:04:22,84
 went and got upon the wall thereof, and stretched

26
00:04:22,84 --> 00:04:41,34
 forth his hand and cried with a loud voice, and

27
00:04:41,34 --> 00:04:59,84
 prophesied unto the people whatsoever things the Lord

28
00:04:59,84 --> 00:05:18,34
 put into his heart

29
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:23,556
5 And he said unto them: Behold, I, Samuel, a

30
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:28,127
 Lamanite, do speak the words of the Lord which he doth

31
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:32,698
 put into my heart; and behold he hath put it into

32
00:05:32,698 --> 00:05:37,269
 my heart to say unto this people that the sword

33
00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:41,84
 of justice hangeth over this people; and four

34
00:05:41,84 --> 00:05:46,411
 hundred years pass not away save the sword of justice

35
00:05:46,411 --> 00:05:50,982
 falleth upon this people

36
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:52,217
6 Yea, heavy destruction awaiteth this people, and

37
00:05:52,217 --> 00:05:53,55
 it surely cometh unto this people, and nothing

38
00:05:53,55 --> 00:05:54,883
 can save this people save it be repentance and faith

39
00:05:54,883 --> 00:05:56,216
 on the Lord Jesus Christ, who surely shall come

40
00:05:56,216 --> 00:05:57,549
 into the world, and shall suffer many things and

41
00:05:57,549 --> 00:05:58,882
 shall be slain for his people

42
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:02,058
7 And behold, an angel of the Lord hath declared

43
00:06:02,058 --> 00:06:05,258
 it unto me, and he did bring glad tidings to my

44
00:06:05,258 --> 00:06:08,459
 soul. And behold, I was sent unto you to declare it

45
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:11,659
 unto you also, that ye might have glad tidings; but

46
00:06:11,659 --> 00:06:14,858
 behold ye would not receive me

47
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:20,141
8 Therefore, thus saith the Lord: Because of the

48
00:06:20,141 --> 00:06:25,474
 hardness of the hearts of the people of the

49
00:06:25,474 --> 00:06:30,807
 Nephites, except they repent I will take away my word

50
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:36,14
 from them, and I will withdraw my Spirit from them,

51
00:06:36,14 --> 00:06:41,473
 and I will suffer them no longer, and I will turn

52
00:06:41,473 --> 00:06:46,806
 the hearts of their brethren against them

53
00:06:46,706 --> 00:07:08,706
9 And four hundred years shall not pass away

54
00:07:08,706 --> 00:07:30,706
 before I will cause that they shall be smitten; yea, I

55
00:07:30,706 --> 00:07:52,706
 will visit them with the sword and with famine and

56
00:07:52,706 --> 00:08:14,706
 with pestilence

57
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:15,76
10 Yea, I will visit them in my fierce anger, and

58
00:08:15,76 --> 00:08:17,093
 there shall be those of the fourth generation who

59
00:08:17,093 --> 00:08:18,426
 shall live, of your enemies, to behold your utter

60
00:08:18,426 --> 00:08:19,759
 destruction; and this shall surely come except ye

61
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,092
 repent, saith the Lord; and those of the fourth

62
00:08:21,092 --> 00:08:22,425
 generation shall visit your destruction

63
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:24,002
11 But if ye will repent and return unto the Lord

64
00:08:24,002 --> 00:08:25,602
 your God I will turn away mine anger, saith the

65
00:08:25,602 --> 00:08:27,202
 Lord; yea, thus saith the Lord, blessed are they who

66
00:08:27,202 --> 00:08:28,802
 will repent and turn unto me, but wo unto him

67
00:08:28,802 --> 00:08:30,402
 that repenteth not

68
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:31,52
12 Yea, wo unto this great city of Zarahemla; for

69
00:08:31,52 --> 00:08:32,663
 behold, it is because of those who are righteous

70
00:08:32,663 --> 00:08:33,806
 that it is saved; yea, wo unto this great city, for

71
00:08:33,806 --> 00:08:34,949
 I perceive, saith the Lord, that there are many,

72
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:36,092
 yea, even the more part of this great city, that

73
00:08:36,092 --> 00:08:37,235
 will harden their hearts against me, saith the

74
00:08:37,235 --> 00:08:38,378
 Lord

75
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:38,351
13 But blessed are they who will repent, for them

76
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:38,351
 will I spare. But behold, if it were not for the

77
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:38,351
 righteous who are in this great city, behold, I

78
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:38,351
 would cause that fire should come down out of heaven

79
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:38,351
 and destroy it

80
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:44,085
14 But behold, it is for the righteous’ sake that

81
00:08:44,085 --> 00:08:49,418
 it is spared. But behold, the time cometh, saith

82
00:08:49,418 --> 00:08:54,751
 the Lord, that when ye shall cast out the righteous

83
00:08:54,751 --> 00:09:00,084
 from among you, then shall ye be ripe for

84
00:09:00,084 --> 00:09:05,417
 destruction; yea, wo be unto this great city, because of

85
00:09:05,417 --> 00:09:10,75
 the wickedness and abominations which are in her

86
00:09:10,65 --> 00:09:11,15
15 Yea, and wo be unto the city of Gideon, for the

87
00:09:11,15 --> 00:09:11,65
 wickedness and abominations which are in her

88
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:14,834
16 Yea, and wo be unto all the cities which are in

89
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:18,584
 the land round about, which are possessed by the

90
00:09:18,584 --> 00:09:22,334
 Nephites, because of the wickedness and

91
00:09:22,334 --> 00:09:26,084
 abominations which are in them

92
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:32,566
17 And behold, a curse shall come upon the land,

93
00:09:32,566 --> 00:09:38,566
 saith the Lord of Hosts, because of the people’s

94
00:09:38,566 --> 00:09:44,566
 sake who are upon the land, yea, because of their

95
00:09:44,566 --> 00:09:50,566
 wickedness and their abominations

96
00:09:50,59 --> 00:09:57,09
18 And it shall come to pass, saith the Lord of

97
00:09:57,09 --> 00:10:03,59
 Hosts, yea, our great and true God, that whoso shall

98
00:10:03,59 --> 00:10:10,09
 hide up treasures in the earth shall find them

99
00:10:10,09 --> 00:10:16,59
 again no more, because of the great curse of the

100
00:10:16,59 --> 00:10:23,09
 land, save he be a righteous man and shall hide it up

101
00:10:23,09 --> 00:10:29,59
 unto the Lord

102
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:34,687
19 For I will, saith the Lord, that they shall

103
00:10:34,687 --> 00:10:40,312
 hide up their treasures unto me; and cursed be they

104
00:10:40,312 --> 00:10:45,937
 who hide not up their treasures unto me; for none

105
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:51,562
 hideth up their treasures unto me save it be the

106
00:10:51,562 --> 00:10:57,187
 righteous; and he that hideth not up his treasures

107
00:10:57,187 --> 00:11:02,812
 unto me, cursed is he, and also the treasure, and

108
00:11:02,812 --> 00:11:08,437
 none shall redeem it because of the curse of the

109
00:11:08,437 --> 00:11:14,062
 land

110
00:11:14,24 --> 00:11:20,865
20 And the day shall come that they shall hide up

111
00:11:20,865 --> 00:11:27,49
 their treasures, because they have set their

112
00:11:27,49 --> 00:11:34,115
 hearts upon riches; and because they have set their

113
00:11:34,115 --> 00:11:40,74
 hearts upon their riches, and will hide up their

114
00:11:40,74 --> 00:11:47,365
 treasures when they shall flee before their enemies;

115
00:11:47,365 --> 00:11:53,99
 because they will not hide them up unto me, cursed

116
00:11:53,99 --> 00:12:00,615
 be they and also their treasures; and in that day

117
00:12:00,615 --> 00:12:07,24
 shall they be smitten, saith the Lord

118
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:13,336
21 Behold ye, the people of this great city, and

119
00:12:13,336 --> 00:12:19,479
 hearken unto my words; yea, hearken unto the words

120
00:12:19,479 --> 00:12:25,622
 which the Lord saith; for behold, he saith that ye

121
00:12:25,622 --> 00:12:31,765
 are cursed because of your riches, and also are

122
00:12:31,765 --> 00:12:37,908
 your riches cursed because ye have set your hearts

123
00:12:37,908 --> 00:12:44,051
 upon them, and have not hearkened unto the words

124
00:12:44,051 --> 00:12:50,194
 of him who gave them unto you

125
00:12:50,87 --> 00:12:58,745
22 Ye do not remember the Lord your God in the

126
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:06,62
 things with which he hath blessed you, but ye do

127
00:13:06,62 --> 00:13:14,495
 always remember your riches, not to thank the Lord

128
00:13:14,495 --> 00:13:22,37
 your God for them; yea, your hearts are not drawn out

129
00:13:22,37 --> 00:13:30,245
 unto the Lord, but they do swell with great

130
00:13:30,245 --> 00:13:38,12
 pride, unto boasting, and unto great swelling,

131
00:13:38,12 --> 00:13:45,995
 envyings, strifes, malice, persecutions, and murders, and

132
00:13:45,995 --> 00:13:53,87
 all manner of iniquities

133
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,6
23 For this cause hath the Lord God caused that a

134
00:13:55,6 --> 00:13:57,267
 curse should come upon the land, and also upon

135
00:13:57,267 --> 00:13:58,934
 your riches, and this because of your iniquities

136
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:05,371
24 Yea, wo unto this people, because of this time

137
00:14:05,371 --> 00:14:11,771
 which has arrived, that ye do cast out the

138
00:14:11,771 --> 00:14:18,171
 prophets, and do mock them, and cast stones at them, and

139
00:14:18,171 --> 00:14:24,571
 do slay them, and do all manner of iniquity unto

140
00:14:24,571 --> 00:14:30,971
 them, even as they did of old time

141
00:14:30,87 --> 00:14:37,62
25 And now when ye talk, ye say: If our days had

142
00:14:37,62 --> 00:14:44,37
 been in the days of our fathers of old, we would

143
00:14:44,37 --> 00:14:51,12
 not have slain the prophets; we would not have

144
00:14:51,12 --> 00:14:57,87
 stoned them, and cast them out

145
00:14:57,163 --> 00:15:09,413
26 Behold ye are worse than they; for as the Lord

146
00:15:09,413 --> 00:15:21,663
 liveth, if a prophet come among you and declareth

147
00:15:21,663 --> 00:15:33,913
 unto you the word of the Lord, which testifieth of

148
00:15:33,913 --> 00:15:46,163
 your sins and iniquities, ye are angry with him,

149
00:15:46,163 --> 00:15:58,413
 and cast him out and seek all manner of ways to

150
00:15:58,413 --> 00:16:10,663
 destroy him; yea, you will say that he is a false

151
00:16:10,663 --> 00:16:22,913
 prophet, and that he is a sinner, and of the devil,

152
00:16:22,913 --> 00:16:35,163
 because he testifieth that your deeds are evil

153
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:35,694
27 But behold, if a man shall come among you and

154
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:36,194
 shall say: Do this, and there is no iniquity; do

155
00:16:36,194 --> 00:16:36,694
 that and ye shall not suffer; yea, he will say: Walk

156
00:16:36,694 --> 00:16:37,194
 after the pride of your own hearts; yea, walk

157
00:16:37,194 --> 00:16:37,694
 after the pride of your eyes, and do whatsoever your

158
00:16:37,694 --> 00:16:38,194
 heart desireth—and if a man shall come among you

159
00:16:38,194 --> 00:16:38,694
 and say this, ye will receive him, and say that he

160
00:16:38,694 --> 00:16:39,194
 is a prophet

161
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:46,565
28 Yea, ye will lift him up, and ye will give unto

162
00:16:46,565 --> 00:16:53,898
 him of your substance; ye will give unto him of

163
00:16:53,898 --> 00:17:01,231
 your gold, and of your silver, and ye will clothe

164
00:17:01,231 --> 00:17:08,564
 him with costly apparel; and because he speaketh

165
00:17:08,564 --> 00:17:15,897
 flattering words unto you, and he saith that all is

166
00:17:15,897 --> 00:17:23,23
 well, then ye will not find fault with him

167
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:28,276
29 O ye wicked and ye perverse generation; ye

168
00:17:28,276 --> 00:17:33,443
 hardened and ye stiffnecked people, how long will ye

169
00:17:33,443 --> 00:17:38,61
 suppose that the Lord will suffer you? Yea, how

170
00:17:38,61 --> 00:17:43,777
 long will ye suffer yourselves to be led by foolish

171
00:17:43,777 --> 00:17:48,944
 and blind guides? Yea, how long will ye choose

172
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:54,111
 darkness rather than light

173
00:17:54,774 --> 00:18:00,107
30 Yea, behold, the anger of the Lord is already

174
00:18:00,107 --> 00:18:05,44
 kindled against you; behold, he hath cursed the

175
00:18:05,44 --> 00:18:10,773
 land because of your iniquity

176
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:17,723
31 And behold, the time cometh that he curseth

177
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:24,723
 your riches, that they become slippery, that ye

178
00:18:24,723 --> 00:18:31,723
 cannot hold them; and in the days of your poverty ye

179
00:18:31,723 --> 00:18:38,723
 cannot retain them

180
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:45,784
32 And in the days of your poverty ye shall cry

181
00:18:45,784 --> 00:18:52,784
 unto the Lord; and in vain shall ye cry, for your

182
00:18:52,784 --> 00:18:59,784
 desolation is already come upon you, and your

183
00:18:59,784 --> 00:19:06,784
 destruction is made sure; and then shall ye weep and

184
00:19:06,784 --> 00:19:13,784
 howl in that day, saith the Lord of Hosts. And then

185
00:19:13,784 --> 00:19:20,784
 shall ye lament, and say

186
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:27,416
33 O that I had repented, and had not killed the

187
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:34,273
 prophets, and stoned them, and cast them out. Yea,

188
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:41,13
 in that day ye shall say: O that we had remembered

189
00:19:41,13 --> 00:19:47,987
 the Lord our God in the day that he gave us our

190
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:54,844
 riches, and then they would not have become

191
00:19:54,844 --> 00:20:01,701
 slippery that we should lose them; for behold, our riches

192
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:08,558
 are gone from us

193
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:13,841
34 Behold, we lay a tool here and on the morrow it

194
00:20:13,841 --> 00:20:19,508
 is gone; and behold, our swords are taken from us

195
00:20:19,508 --> 00:20:25,175
 in the day we have sought them for battle

196
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:29,59
35 Yea, we have hid up our treasures and they have

197
00:20:29,59 --> 00:20:33,923
 slipped away from us, because of the curse of the

198
00:20:33,923 --> 00:20:38,256
 land

199
00:20:38,27 --> 00:20:51,27
36 O that we had repented in the day that the word

200
00:20:51,27 --> 00:21:04,27
 of the Lord came unto us; for behold the land is

201
00:21:04,27 --> 00:21:17,27
 cursed, and all things are become slippery, and we

202
00:21:17,27 --> 00:21:30,27
 cannot hold them

203
00:21:30,156 --> 00:21:31,323
37 Behold, we are surrounded by demons, yea, we

204
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:32,49
 are encircled about by the angels of him who hath

205
00:21:32,49 --> 00:21:33,657
 sought to destroy our souls. Behold, our iniquities

206
00:21:33,657 --> 00:21:34,824
 are great. O Lord, canst thou not turn away thine

207
00:21:34,824 --> 00:21:35,991
 anger from us? And this shall be your language in

208
00:21:35,991 --> 00:21:37,158
 those days

209
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:42,918
38 But behold, your days of probation are past; ye

210
00:21:42,918 --> 00:21:48,807
 have procrastinated the day of your salvation

211
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:54,696
 until it is everlastingly too late, and your

212
00:21:54,696 --> 00:22:00,585
 destruction is made sure; yea, for ye have sought all the

213
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:06,474
 days of your lives for that which ye could not

214
00:22:06,474 --> 00:22:12,363
 obtain; and ye have sought for happiness in doing

215
00:22:12,363 --> 00:22:18,252
 iniquity, which thing is contrary to the nature of

216
00:22:18,252 --> 00:22:24,141
 that righteousness which is in our great and Eternal

217
00:22:24,141 --> 00:22:30,03
 Head

218
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:35,749
39 O ye people of the land, that ye would hear my

219
00:22:35,749 --> 00:22:40,749
 words! And I pray that the anger of the Lord be

220
00:22:40,749 --> 00:22:45,749
 turned away from you, and that ye would repent and

221
00:22:45,749 --> 00:22:50,749
 be saved.
