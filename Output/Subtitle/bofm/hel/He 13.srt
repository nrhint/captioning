1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
The prophecy of Samuel, the Lamanite, to the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Nephites. Comprising chapters 13 through 15.Chapter

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
13 Samuel the Lamanite prophesies the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
destruction of the Nephites unless they repent—They and

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
their riches are cursed—They reject and stone the

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
prophets, are encircled about by demons, and

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:10:40,
seek for happiness in doing iniquity. About 6 B.C. 

8
00:10:40,0 --> 00:10:40,0
1 And now it came to pass in the eighty and

9
00:10:40,0 --> 00:10:40,0
sixth year, the Nephites did still remain in

10
00:10:40,0 --> 00:10:40,0
wickedness, yea, in great wickedness, while the

11
00:10:40,0 --> 00:10:40,0
Lamanites did observe strictly to keep the

12
00:10:40,0 --> 00:11:38,
commandments of God, according to the law of Moses.

13
00:11:38,0 --> 00:11:38,0
2 And it came to pass that in this year

14
00:11:38,0 --> 00:11:38,0
there was one Samuel, a Lamanite, came

15
00:11:38,0 --> 00:11:38,0
into the land of Zarahemla, and began to

16
00:11:38,0 --> 00:11:38,0
preach unto the people. And it came to pass

17
00:11:38,0 --> 00:11:38,0
that he did preach, many days, repentance

18
00:11:38,0 --> 00:11:38,0
unto the people, and they did cast him

19
00:11:38,0 --> 00:11:10,
out, and he was about to return to his own land.

20
00:11:10,0 --> 00:11:10,0
3 But behold, the voice of the Lord

21
00:11:10,0 --> 00:11:10,0
came unto him, that he should return

22
00:11:10,0 --> 00:11:10,0
again, and prophesy unto the people

23
00:11:10,0 --> 00:10:42,
whatsoever things should come into his heart.

24
00:10:42,0 --> 00:10:42,0
4 And it came to pass that they

25
00:10:42,0 --> 00:10:42,0
would not suffer that he should

26
00:10:42,0 --> 00:10:42,0
enter into the city; therefore he

27
00:10:42,0 --> 00:10:42,0
went and got upon the wall

28
00:10:42,0 --> 00:10:42,0
thereof, and stretched forth his hand

29
00:10:42,0 --> 00:10:42,0
and cried with a loud voice, and

30
00:10:42,0 --> 00:10:42,0
prophesied unto the people

31
00:10:42,0 --> 00:11:40,
whatsoever things the Lord put into his heart.

32
00:11:40,0 --> 00:11:40,0
5 And he said unto them: Behold,

33
00:11:40,0 --> 00:11:40,0
I, Samuel, a Lamanite, do speak

34
00:11:40,0 --> 00:11:40,0
the words of the Lord which he

35
00:11:40,0 --> 00:11:40,0
doth put into my heart; and

36
00:11:40,0 --> 00:11:40,0
behold he hath put it into my heart

37
00:11:40,0 --> 00:11:40,0
to say unto this people that the

38
00:11:40,0 --> 00:11:40,0
sword of justice hangeth over

39
00:11:40,0 --> 00:11:40,0
this people; and four hundred

40
00:11:40,0 --> 00:11:40,0
years pass not away save the sword

41
00:11:40,0 --> 00:11:12,
of justice falleth upon this people.

42
00:11:12,0 --> 00:11:12,0
6 Yea, heavy destruction

43
00:11:12,0 --> 00:11:12,0
awaiteth this people, and it surely

44
00:11:12,0 --> 00:11:12,0
cometh unto this people, and

45
00:11:12,0 --> 00:11:12,0
nothing can save this people

46
00:11:12,0 --> 00:11:12,0
save it be repentance and faith

47
00:11:12,0 --> 00:11:12,0
on the Lord Jesus Christ, who

48
00:11:12,0 --> 00:11:12,0
surely shall come into the

49
00:11:12,0 --> 00:11:12,0
world, and shall suffer many

50
00:11:12,0 --> 00:10:44,
things and shall be slain for his people.

51
00:10:44,0 --> 00:10:44,0
7 And behold, an angel of the

52
00:10:44,0 --> 00:10:44,0
Lord hath declared it unto

53
00:10:44,0 --> 00:10:44,0
me, and he did bring glad

54
00:10:44,0 --> 00:10:44,0
tidings to my soul. And behold, I

55
00:10:44,0 --> 00:10:44,0
was sent unto you to declare

56
00:10:44,0 --> 00:10:44,0
it unto you also, that ye

57
00:10:44,0 --> 00:10:44,0
might have glad tidings; but

58
00:10:44,0 --> 00:10:16,
behold ye would not receive me.

59
00:10:16,0 --> 00:10:16,0
8 Therefore, thus saith

60
00:10:16,0 --> 00:10:16,0
the Lord: Because of the

61
00:10:16,0 --> 00:10:16,0
hardness of the hearts of the

62
00:10:16,0 --> 00:10:16,0
people of the Nephites,

63
00:10:16,0 --> 00:10:16,0
except they repent I will

64
00:10:16,0 --> 00:10:16,0
take away my word from

65
00:10:16,0 --> 00:10:16,0
them, and I will withdraw my

66
00:10:16,0 --> 00:10:16,0
Spirit from them, and I

67
00:10:16,0 --> 00:10:16,0
will suffer them no longer,

68
00:10:16,0 --> 00:10:16,0
and I will turn the hearts

69
00:10:16,0 --> 00:09:48,
of their brethren against them.

70
00:09:48,0 --> 00:09:48,0
9 And four hundred

71
00:09:48,0 --> 00:09:48,0
years shall not pass away

72
00:09:48,0 --> 00:09:48,0
before I will cause that

73
00:09:48,0 --> 00:09:48,0
they shall be smitten;

74
00:09:48,0 --> 00:09:48,0
yea, I will visit them

75
00:09:48,0 --> 00:09:48,0
with the sword and

76
00:09:48,0 --> 00:12:16,
with famine and with pestilence.

77
00:12:16,0 --> 00:12:16,0
10 Yea, I will visit

78
00:12:16,0 --> 00:12:16,0
them in my fierce

79
00:12:16,0 --> 00:12:16,0
anger, and there shall be

80
00:12:16,0 --> 00:12:16,0
those of the fourth

81
00:12:16,0 --> 00:12:16,0
generation who shall

82
00:12:16,0 --> 00:12:16,0
live, of your enemies, to

83
00:12:16,0 --> 00:12:16,0
behold your utter

84
00:12:16,0 --> 00:12:16,0
destruction; and this

85
00:12:16,0 --> 00:12:16,0
shall surely come except

86
00:12:16,0 --> 00:12:16,0
ye repent, saith the

87
00:12:16,0 --> 00:12:16,0
Lord; and those of the

88
00:12:16,0 --> 00:12:16,0
fourth generation shall

89
00:12:16,0 --> 00:11:48,
visit your destruction.

90
00:11:48,0 --> 00:11:48,0
11 But if ye will

91
00:11:48,0 --> 00:11:48,0
repent and return unto

92
00:11:48,0 --> 00:11:48,0
the Lord your God I

93
00:11:48,0 --> 00:11:48,0
will turn away mine

94
00:11:48,0 --> 00:11:48,0
anger, saith the Lord;

95
00:11:48,0 --> 00:11:48,0
yea, thus saith the

96
00:11:48,0 --> 00:11:48,0
Lord, blessed are they

97
00:11:48,0 --> 00:11:48,0
who will repent and

98
00:11:48,0 --> 00:11:48,0
turn unto me, but wo

99
00:11:48,0 --> 00:15:46,
unto him that repenteth not.

100
00:15:46,0 --> 00:15:46,0
12 Yea, wo unto this

101
00:15:46,0 --> 00:15:46,0
great city of

102
00:15:46,0 --> 00:15:46,0
Zarahemla; for behold, it

103
00:15:46,0 --> 00:15:46,0
is because of those

104
00:15:46,0 --> 00:15:46,0
who are righteous

105
00:15:46,0 --> 00:15:46,0
that it is saved;

106
00:15:46,0 --> 00:15:46,0
yea, wo unto this great

107
00:15:46,0 --> 00:15:46,0
city, for I

108
00:15:46,0 --> 00:15:46,0
perceive, saith the Lord,

109
00:15:46,0 --> 00:15:46,0
that there are many,

110
00:15:46,0 --> 00:15:46,0
yea, even the more

111
00:15:46,0 --> 00:15:46,0
part of this great

112
00:15:46,0 --> 00:15:46,0
city, that will harden

113
00:15:46,0 --> 00:15:46,0
their hearts

114
00:15:46,0 --> 00:19:16,
against me, saith the Lord.

115
00:19:16,0 --> 00:19:16,0
13 But blessed are

116
00:19:16,0 --> 00:19:16,0
they who will

117
00:19:16,0 --> 00:19:16,0
repent, for them will I

118
00:19:16,0 --> 00:19:16,0
spare. But behold,

119
00:19:16,0 --> 00:19:16,0
if it were not for

120
00:19:16,0 --> 00:19:16,0
the righteous who

121
00:19:16,0 --> 00:19:16,0
are in this great

122
00:19:16,0 --> 00:19:16,0
city, behold, I would

123
00:19:16,0 --> 00:19:16,0
cause that fire

124
00:19:16,0 --> 00:19:16,0
should come down out

125
00:19:16,0 --> 00:23:44,
of heaven and destroy it.

126
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
14 But behold, it

127
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
is for the

128
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
righteous’ sake that it

129
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
is spared. But

130
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
behold, the time

131
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
cometh, saith the Lord,

132
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
that when ye

133
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
shall cast out the

134
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
righteous from among

135
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
you, then shall ye

136
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
be ripe for

137
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
destruction; yea, wo be

138
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
unto this great

139
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
city, because of

140
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
the wickedness and

141
00:23:44,0 --> 00:27:14,
abominations which are in her.

142
00:27:14,0 --> 00:27:14,0
15 Yea, and wo

143
00:27:14,0 --> 00:27:14,0
be unto the city

144
00:27:14,0 --> 00:27:14,0
of Gideon, for

145
00:27:14,0 --> 00:27:14,0
the wickedness

146
00:27:14,0 --> 00:27:14,0
and abominations

147
00:27:14,0 --> 00:30:10,
which are in her.

148
00:30:10,0 --> 00:30:10,0
16 Yea, and wo

149
00:30:10,0 --> 00:30:10,0
be unto all the

150
00:30:10,0 --> 00:30:10,0
cities which

151
00:30:10,0 --> 00:30:10,0
are in the land

152
00:30:10,0 --> 00:30:10,0
round about,

153
00:30:10,0 --> 00:30:10,0
which are

154
00:30:10,0 --> 00:30:10,0
possessed by the

155
00:30:10,0 --> 00:30:10,0
Nephites, because of

156
00:30:10,0 --> 00:30:10,0
the wickedness

157
00:30:10,0 --> 00:30:10,0
and

158
00:30:10,0 --> 00:31:08,
abominations which are in them.

159
00:31:08,0 --> 00:31:08,0
17 And behold,

160
00:31:08,0 --> 00:31:08,0
a curse shall

161
00:31:08,0 --> 00:31:08,0
come upon the

162
00:31:08,0 --> 00:31:08,0
land, saith

163
00:31:08,0 --> 00:31:08,0
the Lord of

164
00:31:08,0 --> 00:31:08,0
Hosts, because of

165
00:31:08,0 --> 00:31:08,0
the people’s

166
00:31:08,0 --> 00:31:08,0
sake who are

167
00:31:08,0 --> 00:31:08,0
upon the land,

168
00:31:08,0 --> 00:31:08,0
yea, because

169
00:31:08,0 --> 00:31:08,0
of their

170
00:31:08,0 --> 00:31:08,0
wickedness and their

171
00:31:08,0 --> 00:30:40,
abominations.

172
00:30:40,0 --> 00:30:40,0
18 And it

173
00:30:40,0 --> 00:30:40,0
shall come to

174
00:30:40,0 --> 00:30:40,0
pass, saith the

175
00:30:40,0 --> 00:30:40,0
Lord of

176
00:30:40,0 --> 00:30:40,0
Hosts, yea, our

177
00:30:40,0 --> 00:30:40,0
great and true

178
00:30:40,0 --> 00:30:40,0
God, that

179
00:30:40,0 --> 00:30:40,0
whoso shall

180
00:30:40,0 --> 00:30:40,0
hide up

181
00:30:40,0 --> 00:30:40,0
treasures in the

182
00:30:40,0 --> 00:30:40,0
earth shall find

183
00:30:40,0 --> 00:30:40,0
them again no

184
00:30:40,0 --> 00:30:40,0
more,

185
00:30:40,0 --> 00:30:40,0
because of the

186
00:30:40,0 --> 00:30:40,0
great curse of

187
00:30:40,0 --> 00:30:40,0
the land, save

188
00:30:40,0 --> 00:30:40,0
he be a

189
00:30:40,0 --> 00:30:40,0
righteous man and

190
00:30:40,0 --> 00:32:52,
shall hide it up unto the Lord.

191
00:32:52,0 --> 00:32:52,0
19 For I

192
00:32:52,0 --> 00:32:52,0
will, saith the

193
00:32:52,0 --> 00:32:52,0
Lord, that

194
00:32:52,0 --> 00:32:52,0
they shall

195
00:32:52,0 --> 00:32:52,0
hide up their

196
00:32:52,0 --> 00:32:52,0
treasures

197
00:32:52,0 --> 00:32:52,0
unto me; and

198
00:32:52,0 --> 00:32:52,0
cursed be

199
00:32:52,0 --> 00:32:52,0
they who hide

200
00:32:52,0 --> 00:32:52,0
not up their

201
00:32:52,0 --> 00:32:52,0
treasures

202
00:32:52,0 --> 00:32:52,0
unto me; for

203
00:32:52,0 --> 00:32:52,0
none hideth

204
00:32:52,0 --> 00:32:52,0
up their

205
00:32:52,0 --> 00:32:52,0
treasures unto

206
00:32:52,0 --> 00:32:52,0
me save it

207
00:32:52,0 --> 00:32:52,0
be the

208
00:32:52,0 --> 00:32:52,0
righteous; and he

209
00:32:52,0 --> 00:32:52,0
that hideth

210
00:32:52,0 --> 00:32:52,0
not up his

211
00:32:52,0 --> 00:32:52,0
treasures

212
00:32:52,0 --> 00:32:52,0
unto me, cursed

213
00:32:52,0 --> 00:32:52,0
is he, and

214
00:32:52,0 --> 00:32:52,0
also the

215
00:32:52,0 --> 00:32:52,0
treasure, and

216
00:32:52,0 --> 00:32:52,0
none shall

217
00:32:52,0 --> 00:32:52,0
redeem it

218
00:32:52,0 --> 00:32:24,
because of the curse of the land.

219
00:32:24,0 --> 00:32:24,0
20 And the

220
00:32:24,0 --> 00:32:24,0
day shall

224
00:32:24,0 --> 00:32:24,0
treasures,

225
00:32:24,0 --> 00:32:24,0
because

226
00:32:24,0 --> 00:32:24,0
they have set

227
00:32:24,0 --> 00:32:24,0

00:32:24,0 --> 00:32:24,0
hearts upon

00:32:24,0 --> 00:32:24,0
riches; and

230
00:32:24,0 --> 00:32:24,0
because they

233
00:32:24,0 --> 00:32:24,0

00:32:24,0 --> 00:32:24,0
will hide

236
00:32:24,0 --> 00:32:24,0
up their

237
00:32:24,0 --> 00:32:24,0
treasures

238
00:32:24,0 --> 00:32:24,0
when they

239
00:32:24,0 --> 00:32:24,0
shall flee

240
00:32:24,0 --> 00:32:24,0
before their

241
00:32:24,0 --> 00:32:24,0
enemies;

242
00:32:24,0 --> 00:32:24,0
because they

243
00:32:24,0 --> 00:32:24,0
will not hide

244
00:32:24,0 --> 00:32:24,0
them up

245
00:32:24,0 --> 00:32:24,0
unto me,

246
00:32:24,0 --> 00:32:24,0
cursed be they

247
00:32:24,0 --> 00:32:24,0
and also

248
00:32:24,0 --> 00:32:24,0
their

249
00:32:24,0 --> 00:32:24,0
treasures; and in

250
00:32:24,0 --> 00:32:24,0
that day

251
00:32:24,0 --> 00:33:36,
shall they be smitten, saith the Lord.

252
00:33:36,0 --> 00:33:36,0
21 Behold

253
00:33:36,0 --> 00:33:36,0

268
00:33:36,0 --> 00:33:36,0
cursed because

00:33:36,0 --> 00:33:36,0
of your

270
00:33:36,0 --> 00:33:36,0

22 Ye do

283
