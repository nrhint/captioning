Chapter 4 Nephite dissenters and the Lamanites

2
00:00:04,2 --> 00:00:08,4
join forces and take the land of

3
00:00:08,4 --> 00:00:12,6
Zarahemla—The Nephites’ defeats come because of their

4
00:00:12,6 --> 00:00:16,8
wickedness—The Church dwindles, and the people

5
00:00:16,8 --> 00:00:21,321
become weak like the Lamanites. About 38–30 B.C. 

6
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:21,071
1 And it came to pass in the fifty and fourth

7
00:00:21,071 --> 00:00:20,821
year there were many dissensions in the

8
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:20,571
church, and there was also a contention among the

9
00:00:20,571 --> 00:00:20,387
people, insomuch that there was much bloodshed.

10
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:23,72
2 And the rebellious part were slain

11
00:00:23,72 --> 00:00:27,053
and driven out of the land, and they

12
00:00:27,053 --> 00:00:30,764
did go unto the king of the Lamanites.

13
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:31,931
3 And it came to pass that they did

14
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:33,098
endeavor to stir up the Lamanites to

15
00:00:33,098 --> 00:00:34,265
war against the Nephites; but

16
00:00:34,265 --> 00:00:35,432
behold, the Lamanites were exceedingly

17
00:00:35,432 --> 00:00:36,599
afraid, insomuch that they would not

18
00:00:36,599 --> 00:00:37,804
hearken to the words of those dissenters.

19
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:37,679
4 But it came to pass in the fifty

20
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:37,554
and sixth year of the reign of the

21
00:00:37,554 --> 00:00:37,429
judges, there were dissenters who

22
00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:37,304
went up from the Nephites unto the

23
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:37,179
Lamanites; and they succeeded with

24
00:00:37,179 --> 00:00:37,054
those others in stirring them up to

25
00:00:37,054 --> 00:00:36,929
anger against the Nephites; and

26
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:36,87
they were all that year preparing for war.

27
00:00:36,87 --> 00:00:37,37
5 And in the fifty and seventh year

28
00:00:37,37 --> 00:00:37,87
they did come down against the

29
00:00:37,87 --> 00:00:38,37
Nephites to battle, and they did

30
00:00:38,37 --> 00:00:38,87
commence the work of death; yea,

31
00:00:38,87 --> 00:00:39,37
insomuch that in the fifty and eighth year

32
00:00:39,37 --> 00:00:39,87
of the reign of the judges they

33
00:00:39,87 --> 00:00:40,37
succeeded in obtaining possession of

34
00:00:40,37 --> 00:00:40,87
the land of Zarahemla; yea, and

35
00:00:40,87 --> 00:00:41,37
also all the lands, even unto the land

36
00:00:41,37 --> 00:00:41,275
which was near the land Bountiful.

37
00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:40,942
6 And the Nephites and the

38
00:00:40,942 --> 00:00:40,609
armies of Moronihah were driven

39
00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:40,34
even into the land of Bountiful;

40
00:00:40,34 --> 00:00:40,59
7 And there they did fortify

41
00:00:40,59 --> 00:00:40,84
against the Lamanites, from

42
00:00:40,84 --> 00:00:41,09
the west sea, even unto the

43
00:00:41,09 --> 00:00:41,34
east; it being a day’s

44
00:00:41,34 --> 00:00:41,59
journey for a Nephite, on the

45
00:00:41,59 --> 00:00:41,84
line which they had fortified

46
00:00:41,84 --> 00:00:42,09
and stationed their armies

47
00:00:42,09 --> 00:00:42,743
to defend their north country.

48
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:42,643
8 And thus those

49
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:42,543
dissenters of the Nephites, with

50
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:42,443
the help of a numerous army

51
00:00:42,443 --> 00:00:42,343
of the Lamanites, had

52
00:00:42,343 --> 00:00:42,243
obtained all the possession of

53
00:00:42,243 --> 00:00:42,143
the Nephites which was in

54
00:00:42,143 --> 00:00:42,043
the land southward. And

55
00:00:42,043 --> 00:00:41,943
all this was done in the

56
00:00:41,943 --> 00:00:41,843
fifty and eighth and ninth

57
00:00:41,843 --> 00:00:41,808
years of the reign of the judges.

58
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:42,364
9 And it came to pass in

59
00:00:42,364 --> 00:00:42,92
the sixtieth year of the

60
00:00:42,92 --> 00:00:43,476
reign of the judges,

61
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:44,032
Moronihah did succeed with

62
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:44,588
his armies in obtaining

63
00:00:44,588 --> 00:00:45,144
many parts of the land; yea,

64
00:00:45,144 --> 00:00:45,7
they regained many

65
00:00:45,7 --> 00:00:46,256
cities which had fallen into

66
00:00:46,256 --> 00:00:46,213
the hands of the Lamanites.

67
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,546
10 And it came to pass

68
00:00:48,546 --> 00:00:50,879
in the sixty and first

69
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,212
year of the reign of the

70
00:00:53,212 --> 00:00:55,545
judges they succeeded in

71
00:00:55,545 --> 00:00:57,878
regaining even the half

72
00:00:57,878 --> 00:01:00,494
of all their possessions.

73
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:00,911
11 Now this great loss

74
00:01:00,911 --> 00:01:01,328
of the Nephites, and

75
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:01,745
the great slaughter

76
00:01:01,745 --> 00:01:02,162
which was among them,

77
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:02,579
would not have happened

78
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:02,996
had it not been for

79
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:03,413
their wickedness and

80
00:01:03,413 --> 00:01:03,83
their abomination which

81
00:01:03,83 --> 00:01:04,247
was among them; yea,

82
00:01:04,247 --> 00:01:04,664
and it was among those

83
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:05,081
also who professed to

84
00:01:05,081 --> 00:01:05,899
belong to the church of God.

85
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:05,857
12 And it was because

86
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:05,815
of the pride of

87
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:05,773
their hearts, because of

88
00:01:05,773 --> 00:01:05,731
their exceeding

89
00:01:05,731 --> 00:01:05,689
riches, yea, it was

90
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:05,647
because of their oppression

91
00:01:05,647 --> 00:01:05,605
to the poor,

92
00:01:05,605 --> 00:01:05,563
withholding their food from

93
00:01:05,563 --> 00:01:05,521
the hungry,

94
00:01:05,521 --> 00:01:05,479
withholding their clothing

95
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:05,437
from the naked, and

96
00:01:05,437 --> 00:01:05,395
smiting their humble

97
00:01:05,395 --> 00:01:05,353
brethren upon the cheek,

98
00:01:05,353 --> 00:01:05,311
making a mock of that

99
00:01:05,311 --> 00:01:05,269
which was sacred,

100
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:05,227
denying the spirit of

101
00:01:05,227 --> 00:01:05,185
prophecy and of

102
00:01:05,185 --> 00:01:05,143
revelation, murdering,

103
00:01:05,143 --> 00:01:05,101
plundering, lying,

104
00:01:05,101 --> 00:01:05,059
stealing, committing

105
00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:05,017
adultery, rising up in

106
00:01:05,017 --> 00:01:04,975
great contentions, and

107
00:01:04,975 --> 00:01:04,933
deserting away into the

108
00:01:04,933 --> 00:01:04,965
land of Nephi, among the Lamanites—

109
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:05,965
13 And because of

110
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:06,965
this their great

111
00:01:06,965 --> 00:01:07,965
wickedness, and their

112
00:01:07,965 --> 00:01:08,965
boastings in their own

113
00:01:08,965 --> 00:01:09,965
strength, they were

114
00:01:09,965 --> 00:01:10,965
left in their own

115
00:01:10,965 --> 00:01:11,965
strength; therefore

116
00:01:11,965 --> 00:01:12,965
they did not prosper,

117
00:01:12,965 --> 00:01:13,965
but were afflicted

118
00:01:13,965 --> 00:01:14,965
and smitten, and

119
00:01:14,965 --> 00:01:15,965
driven before the

120
00:01:15,965 --> 00:01:16,965
Lamanites, until they had

121
00:01:16,965 --> 00:01:17,965
lost possession of

122
00:01:17,965 --> 00:01:18,812
almost all their lands.

123
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:19,106
14 But behold,

124
00:01:19,106 --> 00:01:19,4
Moronihah did preach

125
00:01:19,4 --> 00:01:19,694
many things unto the

126
00:01:19,694 --> 00:01:19,988
people because of

127
00:01:19,988 --> 00:01:20,282
their iniquity, and

128
00:01:20,282 --> 00:01:20,576
also Nephi and

129
00:01:20,576 --> 00:01:20,87
Lehi, who were the sons

130
00:01:20,87 --> 00:01:21,164
of Helaman, did

131
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:21,458
preach many things

132
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:21,752
unto the people, yea,

133
00:01:21,752 --> 00:01:22,046
and did prophesy

134
00:01:22,046 --> 00:01:22,34
many things unto

135
00:01:22,34 --> 00:01:22,634
them concerning their

136
00:01:22,634 --> 00:01:22,928
iniquities, and

137
00:01:22,928 --> 00:01:23,222
what should come unto

138
00:01:23,222 --> 00:01:23,516
them if they did

139
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:23,216
not repent of their sins.

140
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:24,883
15 And it came to

141
00:01:24,883 --> 00:01:26,55
pass that they

142
00:01:26,55 --> 00:01:28,217
did repent, and

143
00:01:28,217 --> 00:01:29,884
inasmuch as they

144
00:01:29,884 --> 00:01:31,551
did repent they did

145
00:01:31,551 --> 00:01:33,56
begin to prosper.

146
00:01:33,56 --> 00:01:34,945
16 For when

147
00:01:34,945 --> 00:01:36,33
Moronihah saw that

148
00:01:36,33 --> 00:01:37,715
they did repent he

149
00:01:37,715 --> 00:01:39,1
did venture to

150
00:01:39,1 --> 00:01:40,485
lead them forth from

151
00:01:40,485 --> 00:01:41,87
place to place,

152
00:01:41,87 --> 00:01:43,255
and from city to

153
00:01:43,255 --> 00:01:44,64
city, even until

154
00:01:44,64 --> 00:01:46,025
they had regained

155
00:01:46,025 --> 00:01:47,41
the one-half of

156
00:01:47,41 --> 00:01:48,795
their property

157
00:01:48,795 --> 00:01:50,18
and the one-half of

158
00:01:50,18 --> 00:01:51,912
all their lands.

159
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:54,712
17 And thus

160
00:01:54,712 --> 00:01:57,512
ended the sixty

161
00:01:57,512 --> 00:02:00,312
and first year

162
00:02:00,312 --> 00:02:03,112
of the reign

163
00:02:03,112 --> 00:02:05,292
of the judges.

164
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:06,928
18 And it

165
00:02:06,928 --> 00:02:08,564
came to pass in

166
00:02:08,564 --> 00:02:10,2
the sixty and

167
00:02:10,2 --> 00:02:11,836
second year

168
00:02:11,836 --> 00:02:13,472
of the reign

169
00:02:13,472 --> 00:02:15,108
of the

170
00:02:15,108 --> 00:02:16,744
judges, that

171
00:02:16,744 --> 00:02:18,38
Moronihah could

172
00:02:18,38 --> 00:02:20,016
obtain no more

173
00:02:20,016 --> 00:02:21,652
possessions

174
00:02:21,652 --> 00:02:23,643
over the Lamanites.

175
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:23,779
19 Therefore

176
00:02:23,779 --> 00:02:23,915
they did

177
00:02:23,915 --> 00:02:24,051
abandon their

178
00:02:24,051 --> 00:02:24,188
design to

179
00:02:24,188 --> 00:02:24,323
obtain the

180
00:02:24,323 --> 00:02:24,459
remainder of

181
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:24,595
their lands,

182
00:02:24,595 --> 00:02:24,731
for so

183
00:02:24,731 --> 00:02:24,867
numerous were the

184
00:02:24,867 --> 00:02:25,004
Lamanites

185
00:02:25,004 --> 00:02:25,139
that it became

186
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:25,275
impossible

187
00:02:25,275 --> 00:02:25,411
for the

188
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:25,547
Nephites to

189
00:02:25,547 --> 00:02:25,683
obtain more

190
00:02:25,683 --> 00:02:25,819
power over them;

191
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:25,956
therefore

192
00:02:25,956 --> 00:02:26,091
Moronihah did

193
00:02:26,091 --> 00:02:26,227
employ all

194
00:02:26,227 --> 00:02:26,363
his armies

195
00:02:26,363 --> 00:02:26,499
in

196
00:02:26,499 --> 00:02:26,046
maintaining those parts which he had taken.

197
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:26,671
20 And it

198
00:02:26,671 --> 00:02:27,296
came to

199
00:02:27,296 --> 00:02:27,921
pass, because

200
00:02:27,921 --> 00:02:28,546
of the

201
00:02:28,546 --> 00:02:29,171
greatness of the

202
00:02:29,171 --> 00:02:29,796
number of

203
00:02:29,796 --> 00:02:30,421
the

204
00:02:30,421 --> 00:02:31,046
Lamanites the

205
00:02:31,046 --> 00:02:31,671
Nephites were

206
00:02:31,671 --> 00:02:32,296
in great

207
00:02:32,296 --> 00:02:32,921
fear, lest

208
00:02:32,921 --> 00:02:33,546
they should be

209
00:02:33,546 --> 00:02:34,171


210
00:02:34,171 --> 00:02:34,796
overpowered, and

211
00:02:34,796 --> 00:02:35,421
trodden down,

212
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:36,423
and slain, and destroyed.

213
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:38,145
21 Yea,

214
00:02:38,145 --> 00:02:39,867
they began

215
00:02:39,867 --> 00:02:41,589
to remember

216
00:02:41,589 --> 00:02:43,311
the

217
00:02:43,311 --> 00:02:45,033
prophecies of

218
00:02:45,033 --> 00:02:46,755
Alma, and

219
00:02:46,755 --> 00:02:48,477
also the

220
00:02:48,477 --> 00:02:50,199
words of

221
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,921
Mosiah; and

222
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,643
they saw

223
00:02:53,643 --> 00:02:55,365
that they

224
00:02:55,365 --> 00:02:57,087
had been a

225
00:02:57,087 --> 00:02:58,809
stiffnecked

226
00:02:58,809 --> 00:03:00,531
people,

227
00:03:00,531 --> 00:03:02,253
and that

228
00:03:02,253 --> 00:03:03,975
they had set

229
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,697
at naught

230
00:03:05,697 --> 00:03:07,387
the commandments of God;

231
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:07,82
22 And

232
00:03:07,82 --> 00:03:08,253
that they

233
00:03:08,253 --> 00:03:08,686
had

234
00:03:08,686 --> 00:03:09,119
altered and

235
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:09,552
trampled

236
00:03:09,552 --> 00:03:09,985
under their

237
00:03:09,985 --> 00:03:10,418
feet the

238
00:03:10,418 --> 00:03:10,851
laws of

239
00:03:10,851 --> 00:03:11,284
Mosiah, or

240
00:03:11,284 --> 00:03:11,717
that

241
00:03:11,717 --> 00:03:12,15
which the

242
00:03:12,15 --> 00:03:12,583
Lord

243
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:13,016
commanded him

244
00:03:13,016 --> 00:03:13,449
to give

245
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:13,882
unto the

246
00:03:13,882 --> 00:03:14,315
people; and

247
00:03:14,315 --> 00:03:14,748
they saw

248
00:03:14,748 --> 00:03:15,181
that

249
00:03:15,181 --> 00:03:15,614
their laws

250
00:03:15,614 --> 00:03:16,047
had become

251
00:03:16,047 --> 00:03:16,48


252
00:03:16,48 --> 00:03:16,913
corrupted, and

253
00:03:16,913 --> 00:03:17,346
that they

254
00:03:17,346 --> 00:03:17,779
had become

255
00:03:17,779 --> 00:03:18,212
a wicked

256
00:03:18,212 --> 00:03:18,645
people,

257
00:03:18,645 --> 00:03:19,078
insomuch

258
00:03:19,078 --> 00:03:19,511
that they

259
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:19,944
were

260
00:03:19,944 --> 00:03:20,767
wicked even like unto the Lamanites.

261
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:22,158
23 And

262
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:23,549
because

263
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:24,94
of their

264
00:03:24,94 --> 00:03:26,331
iniquity

265
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,722
the

266
00:03:27,722 --> 00:03:29,113
church had

267
00:03:29,113 --> 00:03:30,504
begun to

268
00:03:30,504 --> 00:03:31,895


269
00:03:31,895 --> 00:03:33,286
dwindle; and

270
00:03:33,286 --> 00:03:34,677
they began

271
00:03:34,677 --> 00:03:36,068
to

272
00:03:36,068 --> 00:03:37,459
disbelieve

273
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:38,85
in the

274
00:03:38,85 --> 00:03:40,241
spirit of

275
00:03:40,241 --> 00:03:41,632
prophecy

276
00:03:41,632 --> 00:03:43,023
and in

277
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:44,414
the

278
00:03:44,414 --> 00:03:45,805
spirit of

279
00:03:45,805 --> 00:03:47,196


280
00:03:47,196 --> 00:03:48,587
revelation; and

281
00:03:48,587 --> 00:03:49,978
the

282
00:03:49,978 --> 00:03:51,369
judgments of

283
00:03:51,369 --> 00:03:52,199
God did stare them in the face.

284
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,499
24 And

285
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:54,799
they

286
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,099
saw that

287
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:57,399
they

288
00:03:57,399 --> 00:03:58,699
had

289
00:03:58,699 --> 00:03:59,999
become weak,

290
00:03:59,999 --> 00:04:01,299
like

291
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:02,599
unto

292
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:03,899
their

293
00:04:03,899 --> 00:04:05,199
brethren,

294
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,499
the

295
00:04:06,499 --> 00:04:07,799
Lamanites,

296
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:09,099
and

297
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:10,399
that the

298
00:04:10,399 --> 00:04:11,699
Spirit

299
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:12,999
of the

300
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:14,299
Lord did

301
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:15,599
no

302
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,899
more

303
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:18,199
preserve

304
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,499
them; yea,

305
00:04:19,499 --> 00:04:20,799
it had

306
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:22,099


307
00:04:22,099 --> 00:04:23,399
withdrawn

308
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:24,699
from them

309
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:25,999
because

310
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,299
the

311
00:04:27,299 --> 00:04:28,599
Spirit of

312
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:29,899
the

313
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:31,138
Lord doth not dwell in unholy temples—

314
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:31,716
25

315
00:04:31,716 --> 00:04:32,294
Therefore

316
00:04:32,294 --> 00:04:32,872
the

317
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:33,45
Lord

318
00:04:33,45 --> 00:04:34,028
did

319
00:04:34,028 --> 00:04:34,606
cease to

320
00:04:34,606 --> 00:04:35,184


321
00:04:35,184 --> 00:04:35,762
preserve them

322
00:04:35,762 --> 00:04:36,34
by

323
00:04:36,34 --> 00:04:36,918
his

324
00:04:36,918 --> 00:04:37,496
miraculous

325
00:04:37,496 --> 00:04:38,074
and

326
00:04:38,074 --> 00:04:38,652


327
00:04:38,652 --> 00:04:39,23
matchless

328
00:04:39,23 --> 00:04:39,808
power,

329
00:04:39,808 --> 00:04:40,386
for they

330
00:04:40,386 --> 00:04:40,964
had

331
00:04:40,964 --> 00:04:41,542
fallen

332
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:42,12
into a

333
00:04:42,12 --> 00:04:42,698
state

334
00:04:42,698 --> 00:04:43,276
of

335
00:04:43,276 --> 00:04:43,854
unbelief

336
00:04:43,854 --> 00:04:44,432
and

337
00:04:44,432 --> 00:04:45,01
awful

338
00:04:45,01 --> 00:04:45,588


339
00:04:45,588 --> 00:04:46,166
wickedness;

340
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:46,744
and

341
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:47,322
they saw

342
00:04:47,322 --> 00:04:47,9
that

343
00:04:47,9 --> 00:04:48,478
the

344
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:49,056
Lamanites

345
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:49,634
were

346
00:04:49,634 --> 00:04:50,212


347
00:04:50,212 --> 00:04:50,79
exceedingly

348
00:04:50,79 --> 00:04:51,368
more

349
00:04:51,368 --> 00:04:51,946


350
00:04:51,946 --> 00:04:52,524
numerous than

351
00:04:52,524 --> 00:04:53,102
they,

352
00:04:53,102 --> 00:04:53,68
and

353
00:04:53,68 --> 00:04:54,258
except

354
00:04:54,258 --> 00:04:54,836
they

355
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:55,414
should

356
00:04:55,414 --> 00:04:55,992
cleave

357
00:04:55,992 --> 00:04:56,57
unto

358
00:04:56,57 --> 00:04:57,464
the Lord their God they must unavoidably perish.

359
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,464
26

360
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,464
For

361
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,464
behold,

362
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,464
they

363
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,464
saw

364
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,464
that

365
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,464
the

366
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,464


367
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,464
strength of

368
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,464
the

369
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,464


370
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,464
Lamanites

371
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,464
was as

372
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,464


373
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,464
great as

374
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,464
their

375
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,464


376
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,464
strength,

377
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,464
even

378
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,464
man

379
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,464
for

380
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,464
man.

381
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,464
And

382
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,464
thus

383
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,464
had

384
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,464
they

00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,464
fallen

386
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,464
into

387
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,464
this

388
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,464
great

389
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,464


390
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,464


391
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,464
transgression;

392
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,464
yea,

393
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,464
thus

394
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,464
had

395
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,464
they

398
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,464
weak,

399
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,464
because

400
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,464
of

401
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,464
their

402
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,931
transgression, in the space of not many years.
