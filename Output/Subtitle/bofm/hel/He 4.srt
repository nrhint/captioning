Chapter 4 Nephite dissenters and the Lamanites

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
join forces and take the land of

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Zarahemla—The Nephites’ defeats come because of their

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
wickedness—The Church dwindles, and the people

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:14:09,
become weak like the Lamanites. About 38–30 B.C. 

6
00:14:09,0 --> 00:14:09,0
1 And it came to pass in the fifty and fourth

7
00:14:09,0 --> 00:14:09,0
year there were many dissensions in the

8
00:14:09,0 --> 00:14:09,0
church, and there was also a contention among the

9
00:14:09,0 --> 00:15:21,
people, insomuch that there was much bloodshed.

10
00:15:21,0 --> 00:15:21,0
2 And the rebellious part were slain

11
00:15:21,0 --> 00:15:21,0
and driven out of the land, and they

12
00:15:21,0 --> 00:15:07,
did go unto the king of the Lamanites.

13
00:15:07,0 --> 00:15:07,0
3 And it came to pass that they did

14
00:15:07,0 --> 00:15:07,0
endeavor to stir up the Lamanites to

15
00:15:07,0 --> 00:15:07,0
war against the Nephites; but

16
00:15:07,0 --> 00:15:07,0
behold, the Lamanites were exceedingly

17
00:15:07,0 --> 00:15:07,0
afraid, insomuch that they would not

18
00:15:07,0 --> 00:17:49,
hearken to the words of those dissenters.

19
00:17:49,0 --> 00:17:49,0
4 But it came to pass in the fifty

20
00:17:49,0 --> 00:17:49,0
and sixth year of the reign of the

21
00:17:49,0 --> 00:17:49,0
judges, there were dissenters who

22
00:17:49,0 --> 00:17:49,0
went up from the Nephites unto the

23
00:17:49,0 --> 00:17:49,0
Lamanites; and they succeeded with

24
00:17:49,0 --> 00:17:49,0
those others in stirring them up to

25
00:17:49,0 --> 00:17:49,0
anger against the Nephites; and

26
00:17:49,0 --> 00:17:21,
they were all that year preparing for war.

27
00:17:21,0 --> 00:17:21,0
5 And in the fifty and seventh year

28
00:17:21,0 --> 00:17:21,0
they did come down against the

29
00:17:21,0 --> 00:17:21,0
Nephites to battle, and they did

30
00:17:21,0 --> 00:17:21,0
commence the work of death; yea,

31
00:17:21,0 --> 00:17:21,0
insomuch that in the fifty and eighth year

32
00:17:21,0 --> 00:17:21,0
of the reign of the judges they

33
00:17:21,0 --> 00:17:21,0
succeeded in obtaining possession of

34
00:17:21,0 --> 00:17:21,0
the land of Zarahemla; yea, and

35
00:17:21,0 --> 00:17:21,0
also all the lands, even unto the land

36
00:17:21,0 --> 00:19:33,
which was near the land Bountiful.

37
00:19:33,0 --> 00:19:33,0
6 And the Nephites and the

38
00:19:33,0 --> 00:19:33,0
armies of Moronihah were driven

39
00:19:33,0 --> 00:20:17,
even into the land of Bountiful;

40
00:20:17,0 --> 00:20:17,0
7 And there they did fortify

41
00:20:17,0 --> 00:20:17,0
against the Lamanites, from

42
00:20:17,0 --> 00:20:17,0
the west sea, even unto the

43
00:20:17,0 --> 00:20:17,0
east; it being a day’s

44
00:20:17,0 --> 00:20:17,0
journey for a Nephite, on the

45
00:20:17,0 --> 00:20:17,0
line which they had fortified

46
00:20:17,0 --> 00:20:17,0
and stationed their armies

47
00:20:17,0 --> 00:20:31,
to defend their north country.

48
00:20:31,0 --> 00:20:31,0
8 And thus those

49
00:20:31,0 --> 00:20:31,0
dissenters of the Nephites, with

50
00:20:31,0 --> 00:20:31,0
the help of a numerous army

51
00:20:31,0 --> 00:20:31,0
of the Lamanites, had

52
00:20:31,0 --> 00:20:31,0
obtained all the possession of

53
00:20:31,0 --> 00:20:31,0
the Nephites which was in

54
00:20:31,0 --> 00:20:31,0
the land southward. And

55
00:20:31,0 --> 00:20:31,0
all this was done in the

56
00:20:31,0 --> 00:20:31,0
fifty and eighth and ninth

57
00:20:31,0 --> 00:20:45,
years of the reign of the judges.

58
00:20:45,0 --> 00:20:45,0
9 And it came to pass in

59
00:20:45,0 --> 00:20:45,0
the sixtieth year of the

60
00:20:45,0 --> 00:20:45,0
reign of the judges,

61
00:20:45,0 --> 00:20:45,0
Moronihah did succeed with

62
00:20:45,0 --> 00:20:45,0
his armies in obtaining

63
00:20:45,0 --> 00:20:45,0
many parts of the land; yea,

64
00:20:45,0 --> 00:20:45,0
they regained many

65
00:20:45,0 --> 00:20:45,0
cities which had fallen into

66
00:20:45,0 --> 00:23:27,
the hands of the Lamanites.

67
00:23:27,0 --> 00:23:27,0
10 And it came to pass

68
00:23:27,0 --> 00:23:27,0
in the sixty and first

69
00:23:27,0 --> 00:23:27,0
year of the reign of the

70
00:23:27,0 --> 00:23:27,0
judges they succeeded in

71
00:23:27,0 --> 00:23:27,0
regaining even the half

72
00:23:27,0 --> 00:26:09,
of all their possessions.

73
00:26:09,0 --> 00:26:09,0
11 Now this great loss

74
00:26:09,0 --> 00:26:09,0
of the Nephites, and

75
00:26:09,0 --> 00:26:09,0
the great slaughter

76
00:26:09,0 --> 00:26:09,0
which was among them,

77
00:26:09,0 --> 00:26:09,0
would not have happened

78
00:26:09,0 --> 00:26:09,0
had it not been for

79
00:26:09,0 --> 00:26:09,0
their wickedness and

80
00:26:09,0 --> 00:26:09,0
their abomination which

81
00:26:09,0 --> 00:26:09,0
was among them; yea,

82
00:26:09,0 --> 00:26:09,0
and it was among those

83
00:26:09,0 --> 00:26:09,0
also who professed to

84
00:26:09,0 --> 00:31:19,
belong to the church of God.

85
00:31:19,0 --> 00:31:19,0
12 And it was because

86
00:31:19,0 --> 00:31:19,0
of the pride of

87
00:31:19,0 --> 00:31:19,0
their hearts, because of

88
00:31:19,0 --> 00:31:19,0
their exceeding

89
00:31:19,0 --> 00:31:19,0
riches, yea, it was

90
00:31:19,0 --> 00:31:19,0
because of their oppression

91
00:31:19,0 --> 00:31:19,0
to the poor,

92
00:31:19,0 --> 00:31:19,0
withholding their food from

93
00:31:19,0 --> 00:31:19,0
the hungry,

94
00:31:19,0 --> 00:31:19,0
withholding their clothing

95
00:31:19,0 --> 00:31:19,0
from the naked, and

96
00:31:19,0 --> 00:31:19,0
smiting their humble

97
00:31:19,0 --> 00:31:19,0
brethren upon the cheek,

98
00:31:19,0 --> 00:31:19,0
making a mock of that

99
00:31:19,0 --> 00:31:19,0
which was sacred,

100
00:31:19,0 --> 00:31:19,0
denying the spirit of

101
00:31:19,0 --> 00:31:19,0
prophecy and of

102
00:31:19,0 --> 00:31:19,0
revelation, murdering,

103
00:31:19,0 --> 00:31:19,0
plundering, lying,

104
00:31:19,0 --> 00:31:19,0
stealing, committing

105
00:31:19,0 --> 00:31:19,0
adultery, rising up in

106
00:31:19,0 --> 00:31:19,0
great contentions, and

107
00:31:19,0 --> 00:31:19,0
deserting away into the

108
00:31:19,0 --> 00:32:31,
land of Nephi, among the Lamanites—

109
00:32:31,0 --> 00:32:31,0
13 And because of

110
00:32:31,0 --> 00:32:31,0
this their great

111
00:32:31,0 --> 00:32:31,0
wickedness, and their

112
00:32:31,0 --> 00:32:31,0
boastings in their own

113
00:32:31,0 --> 00:32:31,0
strength, they were

114
00:32:31,0 --> 00:32:31,0
left in their own

115
00:32:31,0 --> 00:32:31,0
strength; therefore

116
00:32:31,0 --> 00:32:31,0
they did not prosper,

117
00:32:31,0 --> 00:32:31,0
but were afflicted

118
00:32:31,0 --> 00:32:31,0
and smitten, and

119
00:32:31,0 --> 00:32:31,0
driven before the

120
00:32:31,0 --> 00:32:31,0
Lamanites, until they had

121
00:32:31,0 --> 00:32:31,0
lost possession of

122
00:32:31,0 --> 00:40:43,
almost all their lands.

123
00:40:43,0 --> 00:40:43,0
14 But behold,

124
00:40:43,0 --> 00:40:43,0
Moronihah did preach

125
00:40:43,0 --> 00:40:43,0
many things unto the

126
00:40:43,0 --> 00:40:43,0
people because of

127
00:40:43,0 --> 00:40:43,0
their iniquity, and

128
00:40:43,0 --> 00:40:43,0
also Nephi and

129
00:40:43,0 --> 00:40:43,0
Lehi, who were the sons

130
00:40:43,0 --> 00:40:43,0
of Helaman, did

131
00:40:43,0 --> 00:40:43,0
preach many things

132
00:40:43,0 --> 00:40:43,0
unto the people, yea,

133
00:40:43,0 --> 00:40:43,0
and did prophesy

134
00:40:43,0 --> 00:40:43,0
many things unto

135
00:40:43,0 --> 00:40:43,0
them concerning their

136
00:40:43,0 --> 00:40:43,0
iniquities, and

137
00:40:43,0 --> 00:40:43,0
what should come unto

138
00:40:43,0 --> 00:40:43,0
them if they did

139
00:40:43,0 --> 00:47:51,
not repent of their sins.

140
00:47:51,0 --> 00:47:51,0
15 And it came to

141
00:47:51,0 --> 00:47:51,0
pass that they

142
00:47:51,0 --> 00:47:51,0
did repent, and

143
00:47:51,0 --> 00:47:51,0
inasmuch as they

144
00:47:51,0 --> 00:47:51,0
did repent they did

145
00:47:51,0 --> 00:55:20,
begin to prosper.

146
00:55:20,0 --> 00:55:20,0
16 For when

147
00:55:20,0 --> 00:55:20,0
Moronihah saw that

148
00:55:20,0 --> 00:55:20,0
they did repent he

149
00:55:20,0 --> 00:55:20,0
did venture to

150
00:55:20,0 --> 00:55:20,0
lead them forth from

151
00:55:20,0 --> 00:55:20,0
place to place,

152
00:55:20,0 --> 00:55:20,0
and from city to

153
00:55:20,0 --> 00:55:20,0
city, even until

154
00:55:20,0 --> 00:55:20,0
they had regained

155
00:55:20,0 --> 00:55:20,0
the one-half of

156
00:55:20,0 --> 00:55:20,0
their property

157
00:55:20,0 --> 00:55:20,0
and the one-half of

158
00:55:20,0 --> 00:57:32,
all their lands.

159
00:57:32,0 --> 00:57:32,0
17 And thus

160
00:57:32,0 --> 00:57:32,0
ended the sixty

161
00:57:32,0 --> 00:57:32,0
and first year

162
00:57:32,0 --> 00:57:32,0
of the reign

163
00:57:32,0 --> 01:11:41,
of the judges.

164
01:11:41,0 --> 01:11:41,0
18 And it

165
01:11:41,0 --> 01:11:41,0
came to pass in

166
01:11:41,0 --> 01:11:41,0
the sixty and

167
01:11:41,0 --> 01:11:41,0
second year

168
01:11:41,0 --> 01:11:41,0
of the reign

169
01:11:41,0 --> 01:11:41,0
of the

170
01:11:41,0 --> 01:11:41,0
judges, that

171
01:11:41,0 --> 01:11:41,0
Moronihah could

172
01:11:41,0 --> 01:11:41,0
obtain no more

173
01:11:41,0 --> 01:11:41,0
possessions

174
01:11:41,0 --> 01:22:48,
over the Lamanites.

175
01:22:48,0 --> 01:22:48,0
19 Therefore

176
01:22:48,0 --> 01:22:48,0
they did

177
01:22:48,0 --> 01:22:48,0
abandon their

178
01:22:48,0 --> 01:22:48,0
design to

179
01:22:48,0 --> 01:22:48,0
obtain the

180
01:22:48,0 --> 01:22:48,0
remainder of

181
01:22:48,0 --> 01:22:48,0
their lands,

182
01:22:48,0 --> 01:22:48,0
for so

183
01:22:48,0 --> 01:22:48,0
numerous were the

184
01:22:48,0 --> 01:22:48,0
Lamanites

185
01:22:48,0 --> 01:22:48,0
that it became

186
01:22:48,0 --> 01:22:48,0
impossible

187
01:22:48,0 --> 01:22:48,0
for the

188
01:22:48,0 --> 01:22:48,0
Nephites to

189
01:22:48,0 --> 01:22:48,0
obtain more

190
01:22:48,0 --> 01:22:48,0
power over them;

191
01:22:48,0 --> 01:22:48,0
therefore

192
01:22:48,0 --> 01:22:48,0
Moronihah did

193
01:22:48,0 --> 01:22:48,0
employ all

194
01:22:48,0 --> 01:22:48,0
his armies

195
01:22:48,0 --> 01:22:48,0
in

196
01:22:48,0 --> 01:29:56,
maintaining those parts which he had taken.

197
01:29:56,0 --> 01:29:56,0
20 And it

198
01:29:56,0 --> 01:29:56,0
came to

199
01:29:56,0 --> 01:29:56,0
pass, because

200
01:29:56,0 --> 01:29:56,0
of the

201
01:29:56,0 --> 01:29:56,0
greatness of the

202
01:29:56,0 --> 01:29:56,0
number of

203
01:29:56,0 --> 01:29:56,0
the

204
01:29:56,0 --> 01:29:56,0
Lamanites the

205
01:29:56,0 --> 01:29:56,0
Nephites were

206
01:29:56,0 --> 01:29:56,0
in great

207
01:29:56,0 --> 01:29:56,0
fear, lest

208
01:29:56,0 --> 01:29:56,0
they should be

209
01:29:56,0 --> 01:29:56,0


210
01:29:56,0 --> 01:29:56,0
overpowered, and

211
01:29:56,0 --> 01:29:56,0
trodden down,

212
01:29:56,0 --> 01:32:08,
and slain, and destroyed.

213
01:32:08,0 --> 01:32:08,0
21 Yea,

214
01:32:08,0 --> 01:32:08,0
they began

215
01:32:08,0 --> 01:32:08,0
to remember

216
01:32:08,0 --> 01:32:08,0
the

217
01:32:08,0 --> 01:32:08,0
prophecies of

218
01:32:08,0 --> 01:32:08,0
Alma, and

219
01:32:08,0 --> 01:32:08,0
also the

220
01:32:08,0 --> 01:32:08,0
words of

221
01:32:08,0 --> 01:32:08,0
Mosiah; and

222
01:32:08,0 --> 01:32:08,0
they saw

223
01:32:08,0 --> 01:32:08,0
that they

224
01:32:08,0 --> 01:32:08,0
had been a

225
01:32:08,0 --> 01:32:08,0
stiffnecked

226
01:32:08,0 --> 01:32:08,0
people,

227
01:32:08,0 --> 01:32:08,0
and that

228
01:32:08,0 --> 01:32:08,0
they had set

229
01:32:08,0 --> 01:32:08,0
at naught

230
01:32:08,0 --> 01:38:49,
the commandments of God;

231
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
22 And

232
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
that they

233
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
had

234
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
altered and

235
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
trampled

236
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
under their

237
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
feet the

238
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
laws of

239
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
Mosiah, or

240
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
that

241
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
which the

242
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
Lord

243
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
commanded him

244
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
to give

245
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
unto the

246
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
people; and

247
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
they saw

248
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
that

249
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
their laws

250
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
had become

251
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0


252
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
corrupted, and

253
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
that they

254
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
had become

255
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
a wicked

256
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
people,

257
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
insomuch

258
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
that they

259
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
were

260
01:38:49,0 --> 01:39:33,
wicked even like unto the Lamanites.

261
01:39:33,0 --> 01:39:33,0
23 And

262
01:39:33,0 --> 01:39:33,0
because

263
01:39:33,0 --> 01:39:33,0
of their

264
01:39:33,0 --> 01:39:33,0
iniquity

265
01:39:33,0 --> 01:39:33,0
the

266
01:39:33,0 --> 01:39:33,0
church had

267
01:39:33,0 --> 01:39:33,0
begun to

268
01:39:33,0 --> 01:39:33,0


269
01:39:33,0 --> 01:39:33,0
dwindle; and

270
01:39:33,0 --> 01:39:33,0
they began

271
01:39:33,0 --> 01:39:33,0
to

272
01:39:33,0 --> 01:39:33,0
disbelieve

273
01:39:33,0 --> 01:39:33,0
in the

274
01:39:33,0 --> 01:39:33,0
spirit of

275
01:39:33,0 --> 01:39:33,0
prophecy

276
01:39:33,0 --> 01:39:33,0
and in

277
01:39:33,0 --> 01:39:33,0
the

278
01:39:33,0 --> 01:39:33,0
spirit of

279
01:39:33,0 --> 01:39:33,0


280
01:39:33,0 --> 01:39:33,0
revelation; and

281
01:39:33,0 --> 01:39:33,0
the

282
01:39:33,0 --> 01:39:33,0
judgments of

283
01:39:33,0 --> 01:41:45,
God did stare them in the face.

284
01:41:45,0 --> 01:41:45,0
24 And

285
01:41:45,0 --> 01:41:45,0
they

286
01:41:45,0 --> 01:41:45,0
saw that

287
01:41:45,0 --> 01:41:45,0
they

288
01:41:45,0 --> 01:41:45,0
had

289
01:41:45,0 --> 01:41:45,0
become weak,

290
01:41:45,0 --> 01:41:45,0
like

291
01:41:45,0 --> 01:41:45,0
unto

292
01:41:45,0 --> 01:41:45,0
their

293
01:41:45,0 --> 01:41:45,0
brethren,

294
01:41:45,0 --> 01:41:45,0
the

295
01:41:45,0 --> 01:41:45,0
Lamanites,

296
01:41:45,0 --> 01:41:45,0
and

297
01:41:45,0 --> 01:41:45,0
that the

298
01:41:45,0 --> 01:41:45,0
Spirit

299
01:41:45,0 --> 01:41:45,0
of the

300
01:41:45,0 --> 01:41:45,0
Lord did

301
01:41:45,0 --> 01:41:45,0
no

302
01:41:45,0 --> 01:41:45,0
more

303
01:41:45,0 --> 01:41:45,0
preserve

304
01:41:45,0 --> 01:41:45,0
them; yea,

305
01:41:45,0 --> 01:41:45,0
it had

306
01:41:45,0 --> 01:41:45,0


307
01:41:45,0 --> 01:41:45,0
withdrawn

308
01:41:45,0 --> 01:41:45,0
from them

309
01:41:45,0 --> 01:41:45,0
because

310
01:41:45,0 --> 01:41:45,0
the

311
01:41:45,0 --> 01:41:45,0
Spirit of

312
01:41:45,0 --> 01:41:45,0
the

313
01:41:45,0 --> 01:42:57,
Lord doth not dwell in unholy temples—

314
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0
25

315
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0
Therefore

316
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0
the

317
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0
Lord

318
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0
did

319
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0
cease to

320
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0


321
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0
preserve them

322
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0
by

323
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0
his

324
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0
miraculous

325
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0
and

326
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0


327
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0
matchless

328
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0
power,

329
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0
for they

330
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0
had

331
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0
fallen

332
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0
into a

333
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0
state

334
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0
of

335
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0
unbelief

336
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0
and

337
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0
awful

338
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0


339
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0
wickedness;

340
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0
and

341
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0
they saw

342
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0
that

343
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0
the

344
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0
Lamanites

345
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0
were

346
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0


347
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0
exceedingly

348
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0
more

349
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0


350
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0
numerous than

351
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0
they,

352
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0
and

353
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0
except

354
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0
they

355
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0
should

356
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0
cleave

357
01:42:57,0 --> 01:42:57,0
unto

358
01:42:57,0 --> 01:44:09,
the Lord their God they must unavoidably perish.

359
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0
26

360
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0
For

361
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0
behold,

362
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0
they

363
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0
saw

364
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0
that

365
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0
the

366
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0


367
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0
strength of

368
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0
the

369
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0


370
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0
Lamanites

371
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0
was as

372
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0


373
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0
great as

374
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0
their

375
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0


376
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0
strength,

377
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0
even

378
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0
man

379
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0
for

380
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0
man.

381
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0
And

382
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0
thus

383
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0
had

384
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0
they

385
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0
fallen

386
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0
into

387
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0
this

388
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0
great

389
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0


390
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0


391
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0
transgression;

392
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0
yea,

393
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0
thus

394
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0
had

395
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0
they

396
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0
become

397
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0


398
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0
weak,

399
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0
because

400
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0
of

401
01:44:09,0 --> 01:44:09,0
their

402
01:44:09,0 --> 01:56:20,
transgression, in the space of not many years.
