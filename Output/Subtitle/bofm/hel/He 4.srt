Chapter 4 Nephite dissenters and the Lamanites

2
00:00:09,4 --> 00:00:18,8
 join forces and take the land of Zarahemla—The

3
00:00:18,8 --> 00:00:28,2
 Nephites’ defeats come because of their wickedness—The

4
00:00:28,2 --> 00:00:37,6
 Church dwindles, and the people become weak like

5
00:00:37,6 --> 00:00:47,0
 the Lamanites. About 38–30 B.C.

6
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:49,648
1 And it came to pass in the fifty and fourth year

7
00:00:49,648 --> 00:00:51,648
 there were many dissensions in the church, and

8
00:00:51,648 --> 00:00:53,648
 there was also a contention among the people,

9
00:00:53,648 --> 00:00:55,648
 insomuch that there was much bloodshed

10
00:00:55,622 --> 00:01:05,289
2 And the rebellious part were slain and driven

11
00:01:05,289 --> 00:01:14,956
 out of the land, and they did go unto the king of

12
00:01:14,956 --> 00:01:24,623
 the Lamanites

13
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:30,184
3 And it came to pass that they did endeavor to

14
00:01:30,184 --> 00:01:35,984
 stir up the Lamanites to war against the Nephites;

15
00:01:35,984 --> 00:01:41,784
 but behold, the Lamanites were exceedingly afraid,

16
00:01:41,784 --> 00:01:47,584
 insomuch that they would not hearken to the words

17
00:01:47,584 --> 00:01:53,384
 of those dissenters

18
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:59,447
4 But it came to pass in the fifty and sixth year

19
00:01:59,447 --> 00:02:05,279
 of the reign of the judges, there were dissenters

20
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:11,113
 who went up from the Nephites unto the Lamanites;

21
00:02:11,113 --> 00:02:16,946
 and they succeeded with those others in stirring

22
00:02:16,946 --> 00:02:22,779
 them up to anger against the Nephites; and they

23
00:02:22,779 --> 00:02:28,612
 were all that year preparing for war

24
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:32,99
5 And in the fifty and seventh year they did come

25
00:02:32,99 --> 00:02:37,865
 down against the Nephites to battle, and they did

26
00:02:37,865 --> 00:02:42,74
 commence the work of death; yea, insomuch that in

27
00:02:42,74 --> 00:02:47,615
 the fifty and eighth year of the reign of the

28
00:02:47,615 --> 00:02:52,49
 judges they succeeded in obtaining possession of the

29
00:02:52,49 --> 00:02:57,365
 land of Zarahemla; yea, and also all the lands,

30
00:02:57,365 --> 00:03:02,24
 even unto the land which was near the land Bountiful

31
00:03:02,24 --> 00:03:07,115


32
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:14,054
6 And the Nephites and the armies of Moronihah

33
00:03:14,054 --> 00:03:21,054
 were driven even into the land of Bountiful

34
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:28,168
7 And there they did fortify against the

35
00:03:28,168 --> 00:03:34,768
 Lamanites, from the west sea, even unto the east; it being

36
00:03:34,768 --> 00:03:41,368
 a day’s journey for a Nephite, on the line which

37
00:03:41,368 --> 00:03:47,968
 they had fortified and stationed their armies to

38
00:03:47,968 --> 00:03:54,568
 defend their north country

39
00:03:54,334 --> 00:04:00,667
8 And thus those dissenters of the Nephites, with

40
00:04:00,667 --> 00:04:07,0
 the help of a numerous army of the Lamanites, had

41
00:04:07,0 --> 00:04:13,333
 obtained all the possession of the Nephites which

42
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:19,666
 was in the land southward. And all this was done

43
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:25,999
 in the fifty and eighth and ninth years of the

44
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:32,332
 reign of the judges

45
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:37,805
9 And it came to pass in the sixtieth year of the

46
00:04:37,805 --> 00:04:43,605
 reign of the judges, Moronihah did succeed with

47
00:04:43,605 --> 00:04:49,405
 his armies in obtaining many parts of the land; yea,

48
00:04:49,405 --> 00:04:55,205
 they regained many cities which had fallen into

49
00:04:55,205 --> 00:05:01,005
 the hands of the Lamanites

50
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:06,668
10 And it came to pass in the sixty and first year

51
00:05:06,668 --> 00:05:12,335
 of the reign of the judges they succeeded in

52
00:05:12,335 --> 00:05:18,002
 regaining even the half of all their possessions

53
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:24,618
11 Now this great loss of the Nephites, and the

54
00:05:24,618 --> 00:05:30,618
 great slaughter which was among them, would not have

55
00:05:30,618 --> 00:05:36,618
 happened had it not been for their wickedness and

56
00:05:36,618 --> 00:05:42,618
 their abomination which was among them; yea, and

57
00:05:42,618 --> 00:05:48,618
 it was among those also who professed to belong to

58
00:05:48,618 --> 00:05:54,618
 the church of God

59
00:05:54,287 --> 00:06:00,014
12 And it was because of the pride of their

60
00:06:00,014 --> 00:06:05,741
 hearts, because of their exceeding riches, yea, it was

61
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:11,468
 because of their oppression to the poor,

62
00:06:11,468 --> 00:06:17,195
 withholding their food from the hungry, withholding their

63
00:06:17,195 --> 00:06:22,922
 clothing from the naked, and smiting their humble

64
00:06:22,922 --> 00:06:28,649
 brethren upon the cheek, making a mock of that which

65
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:34,376
 was sacred, denying the spirit of prophecy and of

66
00:06:34,376 --> 00:06:40,103
 revelation, murdering, plundering, lying,

67
00:06:40,103 --> 00:06:45,83
 stealing, committing adultery, rising up in great

68
00:06:45,83 --> 00:06:51,557
 contentions, and deserting away into the land of Nephi,

69
00:06:51,557 --> 00:06:57,284
 among the Lamanites

70
00:06:57,851 --> 00:07:04,851
13 And because of this their great wickedness, and

71
00:07:04,851 --> 00:07:11,851
 their boastings in their own strength, they were

72
00:07:11,851 --> 00:07:18,851
 left in their own strength; therefore they did not

73
00:07:18,851 --> 00:07:25,851
 prosper, but were afflicted and smitten, and

74
00:07:25,851 --> 00:07:32,851
 driven before the Lamanites, until they had lost

75
00:07:32,851 --> 00:07:39,851
 possession of almost all their lands

76
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:44,812
14 But behold, Moronihah did preach many things

77
00:07:44,812 --> 00:07:50,098
 unto the people because of their iniquity, and also

78
00:07:50,098 --> 00:07:55,384
 Nephi and Lehi, who were the sons of Helaman, did

79
00:07:55,384 --> 00:08:00,67
 preach many things unto the people, yea, and did

80
00:08:00,67 --> 00:08:05,956
 prophesy many things unto them concerning their

81
00:08:05,956 --> 00:08:11,242
 iniquities, and what should come unto them if they

82
00:08:11,242 --> 00:08:16,528
 did not repent of their sins

83
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:19,629
15 And it came to pass that they did repent, and

84
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:22,962
 inasmuch as they did repent they did begin to

85
00:08:22,962 --> 00:08:26,295
 prosper

86
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:33,173
16 For when Moronihah saw that they did repent he

87
00:08:33,173 --> 00:08:39,973
 did venture to lead them forth from place to

88
00:08:39,973 --> 00:08:46,773
 place, and from city to city, even until they had

89
00:08:46,773 --> 00:08:53,573
 regained the one-half of their property and the

90
00:08:53,573 --> 00:09:00,373
 one-half of all their lands

91
00:09:00,34 --> 00:09:05,34
17 And thus ended the sixty and first year of the

92
00:09:05,34 --> 00:09:10,34
 reign of the judges

93
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:15,449
18 And it came to pass in the sixty and second

94
00:09:15,449 --> 00:09:20,782
 year of the reign of the judges, that Moronihah could

95
00:09:20,782 --> 00:09:26,115
 obtain no more possessions over the Lamanites

96
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:33,532
19 Therefore they did abandon their design to

97
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:40,365
 obtain the remainder of their lands, for so numerous

98
00:09:40,365 --> 00:09:47,198
 were the Lamanites that it became impossible for

99
00:09:47,198 --> 00:09:54,031
 the Nephites to obtain more power over them;

100
00:09:54,031 --> 00:10:00,864
 therefore Moronihah did employ all his armies in

101
00:10:00,864 --> 00:10:07,697
 maintaining those parts which he had taken

102
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:12,707
20 And it came to pass, because of the greatness

103
00:10:12,707 --> 00:10:18,207
 of the number of the Lamanites the Nephites were in

104
00:10:18,207 --> 00:10:23,707
 great fear, lest they should be overpowered, and

105
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:29,207
 trodden down, and slain, and destroyed

106
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:36,445
21 Yea, they began to remember the prophecies of

107
00:10:36,445 --> 00:10:43,695
 Alma, and also the words of Mosiah; and they saw

108
00:10:43,695 --> 00:10:50,945
 that they had been a stiffnecked people, and that

109
00:10:50,945 --> 00:10:58,195
 they had set at naught the commandments of God

110
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:03,99
22 And that they had altered and trampled under

111
00:11:03,99 --> 00:11:09,824
 their feet the laws of Mosiah, or that which the

112
00:11:09,824 --> 00:11:15,657
 Lord commanded him to give unto the people; and they

113
00:11:15,657 --> 00:11:21,49
 saw that their laws had become corrupted, and that

114
00:11:21,49 --> 00:11:27,322
 they had become a wicked people, insomuch that

115
00:11:27,322 --> 00:11:33,156
 they were wicked even like unto the Lamanites

116
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:38,793
23 And because of their iniquity the church had

117
00:11:38,793 --> 00:11:43,993
 begun to dwindle; and they began to disbelieve in

118
00:11:43,993 --> 00:11:49,193
 the spirit of prophecy and in the spirit of

119
00:11:49,193 --> 00:11:54,393
 revelation; and the judgments of God did stare them in the

120
00:11:54,393 --> 00:11:59,593
 face

121
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:06,152
24 And they saw that they had become weak, like

122
00:12:06,152 --> 00:12:12,752
 unto their brethren, the Lamanites, and that the

123
00:12:12,752 --> 00:12:19,352
 Spirit of the Lord did no more preserve them; yea, it

124
00:12:19,352 --> 00:12:25,952
 had withdrawn from them because the Spirit of the

125
00:12:25,952 --> 00:12:32,552
 Lord doth not dwell in unholy temples

126
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:38,499
25 Therefore the Lord did cease to preserve them

127
00:12:38,499 --> 00:12:44,213
 by his miraculous and matchless power, for they had

128
00:12:44,213 --> 00:12:49,927
 fallen into a state of unbelief and awful

129
00:12:49,927 --> 00:12:55,641
 wickedness; and they saw that the Lamanites were

130
00:12:55,641 --> 00:13:01,355
 exceedingly more numerous than they, and except they

131
00:13:01,355 --> 00:13:07,069
 should cleave unto the Lord their God they must

132
00:13:07,069 --> 00:13:12,783
 unavoidably perish

133
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:15,359
26 For behold, they saw that the strength of the

134
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:18,026
 Lamanites was as great as their strength, even man

135
00:13:18,026 --> 00:13:20,693
 for man. And thus had they fallen into this great

136
00:13:20,693 --> 00:13:23,36
 transgression; yea, thus had they become weak,

137
00:13:23,36 --> 00:13:26,027
 because of their transgression, in the space of not

138
00:13:26,027 --> 00:13:28,694
 many years.
