00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:08,2
Chapter 9 Messengers find the chief judge

2
00:00:08,2 --> 00:00:16,4
dead at the judgment seat—They are imprisoned

3
00:00:16,4 --> 00:00:24,6
and later released—By inspiration Nephi

4
00:00:24,6 --> 00:00:32,8
identifies Seantum as the murderer—Nephi is

5
00:00:32,8 --> 00:00:41,341
accepted by some as a prophet. About 23–21 B.C. 

6
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:46,541
1 Behold, now it came to pass that when

7
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:51,741
Nephi had spoken these words, certain men

8
00:00:51,741 --> 00:00:56,941
who were among them ran to the

9
00:00:56,941 --> 00:01:02,141
judgment-seat; yea, even there were five who went,

10
00:01:02,141 --> 00:01:07,668
and they said among themselves, as they went:

11
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:09,868
2 Behold, now we will know of a surety

12
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:12,068
whether this man be a prophet and God

13
00:01:12,068 --> 00:01:14,268
hath commanded him to prophesy such

14
00:01:14,268 --> 00:01:16,468
marvelous things unto us. Behold, we do not

15
00:01:16,468 --> 00:01:18,668
believe that he hath; yea, we do not

16
00:01:18,668 --> 00:01:20,868
believe that he is a prophet;

17
00:01:20,868 --> 00:01:23,068
nevertheless, if this thing which he has said

18
00:01:23,068 --> 00:01:25,268
concerning the chief judge be true, that

19
00:01:25,268 --> 00:01:27,468
he be dead, then will we believe that

20
00:01:27,468 --> 00:01:29,923
the other words which he has spoken are true.

21
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:29,723
3 And it came to pass that they

22
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:29,523
ran in their might, and came in

23
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:29,323
unto the judgment-seat; and behold,

24
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:29,123
the chief judge had fallen to

25
00:01:29,123 --> 00:01:28,989
the earth, and did lie in his blood.

26
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:32,489
4 And now behold, when they saw

27
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:35,989
this they were astonished

28
00:01:35,989 --> 00:01:39,489
exceedingly, insomuch that they fell

29
00:01:39,489 --> 00:01:42,989
to the earth; for they had not

30
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:46,489
believed the words which Nephi had

31
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:49,309
spoken concerning the chief judge.

32
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:49,309
5 But now, when they saw

33
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:49,309
they believed, and fear came

34
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:49,309
upon them lest all the

35
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:49,309
judgments which Nephi had

36
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:49,309
spoken should come upon the

37
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:49,309
people; therefore they did

38
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:49,776
quake, and had fallen to the earth.

39
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
6 Now, immediately when

40
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
the judge had been

41
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
murdered—he being stabbed by

42
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
his brother by a garb of

43
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
secrecy, and he fled,

44
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
and the servants ran and

45
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
told the people, raising

46
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
the cry of murder among them;

47
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
7 And behold the

48
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
people did gather

49
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
themselves together unto the

50
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
place of the

51
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
judgment-seat—and behold, to

52
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
their astonishment they

53
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
saw those five men who

54
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
had fallen to the earth.

55
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
8 And now behold, the

56
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
people knew nothing

57
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
concerning the

58
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
multitude who had gathered

59
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
together at the

60
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
garden of Nephi; therefore

61
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
they said among

62
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
themselves: These men are

63
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
they who have

64
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
murdered the judge, and God

65
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
has smitten them

66
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
that they could not flee from us.

67
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
9 And it came to

68
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
pass that they laid

69
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
hold on them, and bound

70
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
them and cast them

71
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
into prison. And

72
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
there was a

73
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
proclamation sent abroad that

74
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
the judge was slain,

75
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
and that the

76
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
murderers had been taken

77
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
and were cast into prison.

78
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
10 And it came to

79
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
pass that on the

80
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
morrow the people

81
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
did assemble

82
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
themselves together to

83
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
mourn and to fast,

84
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
at the burial of

85
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
the great chief

86
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
judge who had been slain.

87
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
11 And thus also

88
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
those judges who

89
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
were at the garden

90
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
of Nephi, and heard

91
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
his words, were

92
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
also gathered

93
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
together at the burial.

94
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
12 And it came to

95
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
pass that they

96
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
inquired among the

97
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
people, saying:

98
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
Where are the

99
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
five who were sent

100
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
to inquire

101
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
concerning the chief

102
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
judge whether he was

103
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
dead? And they

104
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
answered and said:

105
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
Concerning this

106
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
five whom ye say

107
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
ye have sent, we

108
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
know not; but

109
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
there are five who

110
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
are the murderers,

111
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
whom we have cast into prison.

112
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
13 And it came

113
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
to pass that the

114
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
judges desired

115
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
that they should

116
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
be brought; and

117
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
they were

118
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
brought, and behold

119
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
they were the five

120
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
who were sent;

121
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
and behold the

122
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
judges inquired

123
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
of them to know

124
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
concerning the

125
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
matter, and they

126
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
told them all

127
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
that they had done, saying:

128
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
14 We ran and

129
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
came to the

130
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
place of the

131
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
judgment-seat, and

132
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
when we saw all

133
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
things even as

134
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
Nephi had

135
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
testified, we were

136
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
astonished

137
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
insomuch that we fell

138
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
to the earth;

139
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
and when we

140
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
were recovered

141
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
from our

142
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
astonishment, behold

143
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
they cast us into prison.

144
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
15 Now, as for

145
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
the murder of

146
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
this man, we

147
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
know not who

148
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
has done it;

149
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
and only this

150
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
much we know, we

151
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
ran and came

152
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
according as

153
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
ye desired, and

154
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
behold he was

155
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
dead,

156
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
according to the words of Nephi.

157
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
16 And now it

158
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
came to pass

159
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
that the

160
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
judges did

161
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
expound the matter

162
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
unto the

163
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
people, and did

164
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
cry out

165
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
against Nephi,

166
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
saying: Behold,

167
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
we know that

168
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
this Nephi

169
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
must have

170
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
agreed with some

171
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
one to slay

172
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
the judge, and

173
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
then he might

174
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
declare it

175
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
unto us, that

176
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
he might

177
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
convert us unto

178
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
his faith,

179
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
that he might

180
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
raise himself

181
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
to be a great

182
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
man, chosen of God, and a prophet.

183
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
17 And now

184
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
behold, we will

185
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
detect this

186
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
man, and he

187
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
shall confess

188
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
his fault and

189
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
make known

190
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
unto us the

191
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
true murderer

192
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
of this judge.

193
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
18 And it

194
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
came to pass

195
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
that the five

196
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
were

197
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
liberated on the

198
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
day of the

199
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
burial.

200
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
Nevertheless, they

201
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
did rebuke

202
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
the judges

203
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
in the words

204
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
which they

205
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
had spoken

206
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
against Nephi,

207
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
and did

208
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
contend with

209
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
them one by

210
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
one, insomuch

211
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
that they did confound them.

212
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
19

213
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
Nevertheless, they

214
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
caused that

215
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
Nephi

216
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
should be taken

217
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
and bound

218
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
and brought

219
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
before the

220
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
multitude,

221
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
and they

222
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
began to

223
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
question him

224
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
in divers

225
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
ways that

226
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
they might

227
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
cross him,

228
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
that they

229
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
might accuse him to death—

230
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
20 Saying

231
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
unto him:

232
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
Thou art

233
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776


234
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
confederate; who is

235
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776

236
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
that hath

237
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
done this

238
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
murder? Now

239
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
tell us,

240
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776

242
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776

243
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
saying, Behold

244
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
here is

245
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
money; and

246
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
also we

247
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
will grant

248
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776

249
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
thy life if

250
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776

251
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
tell us,

252
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776

256
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
21 But

257
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
Nephi said

258
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776
unto

259
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:49,776

22 O ye
