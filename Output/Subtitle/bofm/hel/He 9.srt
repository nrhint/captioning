00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:08,8
Chapter 9 Messengers find the chief judge dead at

2
00:00:08,8 --> 00:00:17,6
 the judgment seat—They are imprisoned and later

3
00:00:17,6 --> 00:00:26,4
 released—By inspiration Nephi identifies Seantum as

4
00:00:26,4 --> 00:00:35,2
 the murderer—Nephi is accepted by some as a

5
00:00:35,2 --> 00:00:44,0
 prophet. About 23–21 B.C.

6
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:48,944
1 Behold, now it came to pass that when Nephi had

7
00:00:48,944 --> 00:00:53,744
 spoken these words, certain men who were among

8
00:00:53,744 --> 00:00:58,544
 them ran to the judgment-seat; yea, even there were

9
00:00:58,544 --> 00:01:03,344
 five who went, and they said among themselves, as

10
00:01:03,344 --> 00:01:08,144
 they went

11
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:14,294
2 Behold, now we will know of a surety whether

12
00:01:14,294 --> 00:01:19,919
 this man be a prophet and God hath commanded him to

13
00:01:19,919 --> 00:01:25,544
 prophesy such marvelous things unto us. Behold, we

14
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:31,169
 do not believe that he hath; yea, we do not

15
00:01:31,169 --> 00:01:36,794
 believe that he is a prophet; nevertheless, if this

16
00:01:36,794 --> 00:01:42,419
 thing which he has said concerning the chief judge be

17
00:01:42,419 --> 00:01:48,044
 true, that he be dead, then will we believe that

18
00:01:48,044 --> 00:01:53,669
 the other words which he has spoken are true

19
00:01:53,38 --> 00:01:58,63
3 And it came to pass that they ran in their

20
00:01:58,63 --> 00:02:03,88
 might, and came in unto the judgment-seat; and behold,

21
00:02:03,88 --> 00:02:09,13
 the chief judge had fallen to the earth, and did

22
00:02:09,13 --> 00:02:14,38
 lie in his blood

23
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:20,718
4 And now behold, when they saw this they were

24
00:02:20,718 --> 00:02:26,968
 astonished exceedingly, insomuch that they fell to

25
00:02:26,968 --> 00:02:33,218
 the earth; for they had not believed the words which

26
00:02:33,218 --> 00:02:39,468
 Nephi had spoken concerning the chief judge

27
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:49,059
5 But now, when they saw they believed, and fear

28
00:02:49,059 --> 00:02:59,059
 came upon them lest all the judgments which Nephi

29
00:02:59,059 --> 00:03:09,059
 had spoken should come upon the people; therefore

30
00:03:09,059 --> 00:03:19,059
 they did quake, and had fallen to the earth

31
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:21,816
6 Now, immediately when the judge had been

32
00:03:21,816 --> 00:03:24,566
 murdered—he being stabbed by his brother by a garb of

33
00:03:24,566 --> 00:03:27,316
 secrecy, and he fled, and the servants ran and told

34
00:03:27,316 --> 00:03:30,066
 the people, raising the cry of murder among them

35
00:03:30,61 --> 00:03:36,11
7 And behold the people did gather themselves

36
00:03:36,11 --> 00:03:41,61
 together unto the place of the judgment-seat—and

37
00:03:41,61 --> 00:03:47,11
 behold, to their astonishment they saw those five men

38
00:03:47,11 --> 00:03:52,61
 who had fallen to the earth

39
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:56,599
8 And now behold, the people knew nothing

40
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:01,099
 concerning the multitude who had gathered together at the

41
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:05,599
 garden of Nephi; therefore they said among

42
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,099
 themselves: These men are they who have murdered the

43
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:14,599
 judge, and God has smitten them that they could not

44
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:19,099
 flee from us

45
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:24,593
9 And it came to pass that they laid hold on them,

46
00:04:24,593 --> 00:04:29,393
 and bound them and cast them into prison. And

47
00:04:29,393 --> 00:04:34,193
 there was a proclamation sent abroad that the judge

48
00:04:34,193 --> 00:04:38,993
 was slain, and that the murderers had been taken

49
00:04:38,993 --> 00:04:43,793
 and were cast into prison

50
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:48,717
10 And it came to pass that on the morrow the

51
00:04:48,717 --> 00:04:53,717
 people did assemble themselves together to mourn and

52
00:04:53,717 --> 00:04:58,717
 to fast, at the burial of the great chief judge who

53
00:04:58,717 --> 00:05:03,717
 had been slain

54
00:05:03,57 --> 00:05:12,57
11 And thus also those judges who were at the

55
00:05:12,57 --> 00:05:21,57
 garden of Nephi, and heard his words, were also

56
00:05:21,57 --> 00:05:30,57
 gathered together at the burial

57
00:05:30,73 --> 00:05:34,016
12 And it came to pass that they inquired among

58
00:05:34,016 --> 00:05:37,302
 the people, saying: Where are the five who were sent

59
00:05:37,302 --> 00:05:40,588
 to inquire concerning the chief judge whether he

60
00:05:40,588 --> 00:05:43,874
 was dead? And they answered and said: Concerning

61
00:05:43,874 --> 00:05:47,16
 this five whom ye say ye have sent, we know not;

62
00:05:47,16 --> 00:05:50,446
 but there are five who are the murderers, whom we

63
00:05:50,446 --> 00:05:53,732
 have cast into prison

64
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:58,954
13 And it came to pass that the judges desired

65
00:05:58,954 --> 00:06:03,954
 that they should be brought; and they were brought,

66
00:06:03,954 --> 00:06:08,954
 and behold they were the five who were sent; and

67
00:06:08,954 --> 00:06:13,954
 behold the judges inquired of them to know

68
00:06:13,954 --> 00:06:18,954
 concerning the matter, and they told them all that they had

69
00:06:18,954 --> 00:06:23,954
 done, saying

70
00:06:23,45 --> 00:06:29,65
14 We ran and came to the place of the

71
00:06:29,65 --> 00:06:35,85
 judgment-seat, and when we saw all things even as Nephi had

72
00:06:35,85 --> 00:06:42,05
 testified, we were astonished insomuch that we fell

73
00:06:42,05 --> 00:06:48,25
 to the earth; and when we were recovered from our

74
00:06:48,25 --> 00:06:54,45
 astonishment, behold they cast us into prison

75
00:06:54,881 --> 00:07:00,881
15 Now, as for the murder of this man, we know not

76
00:07:00,881 --> 00:07:06,881
 who has done it; and only this much we know, we

77
00:07:06,881 --> 00:07:12,881
 ran and came according as ye desired, and behold he

78
00:07:12,881 --> 00:07:18,881
 was dead, according to the words of Nephi

79
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:23,604
16 And now it came to pass that the judges did

80
00:07:23,604 --> 00:07:29,104
 expound the matter unto the people, and did cry out

81
00:07:29,104 --> 00:07:34,604
 against Nephi, saying: Behold, we know that this

82
00:07:34,604 --> 00:07:40,104
 Nephi must have agreed with some one to slay the

83
00:07:40,104 --> 00:07:45,604
 judge, and then he might declare it unto us, that he

84
00:07:45,604 --> 00:07:51,104
 might convert us unto his faith, that he might

85
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:56,604
 raise himself to be a great man, chosen of God, and a

86
00:07:56,604 --> 00:08:02,104
 prophet

87
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:08,682
17 And now behold, we will detect this man, and he

88
00:08:08,682 --> 00:08:15,015
 shall confess his fault and make known unto us

89
00:08:15,015 --> 00:08:21,348
 the true murderer of this judge

90
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:26,768
18 And it came to pass that the five were

91
00:08:26,768 --> 00:08:32,168
 liberated on the day of the burial. Nevertheless, they did

92
00:08:32,168 --> 00:08:37,568
 rebuke the judges in the words which they had

93
00:08:37,568 --> 00:08:42,968
 spoken against Nephi, and did contend with them one

94
00:08:42,968 --> 00:08:48,368
 by one, insomuch that they did confound them

95
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:53,395
19 Nevertheless, they caused that Nephi should be

96
00:08:53,395 --> 00:08:58,195
 taken and bound and brought before the multitude,

97
00:08:58,195 --> 00:09:02,995
 and they began to question him in divers ways that

98
00:09:02,995 --> 00:09:07,795
 they might cross him, that they might accuse him

99
00:09:07,795 --> 00:09:12,595
 to death

100
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:22,485
20 Saying unto him: Thou art confederate; who is

101
00:09:22,485 --> 00:09:32,818
 this man that hath done this murder? Now tell us,

102
00:09:32,818 --> 00:09:43,151
 and acknowledge thy fault; saying, Behold here is

103
00:09:43,151 --> 00:09:53,484
 money; and also we will grant unto thee thy life if

104
00:09:53,484 --> 00:10:03,817
 thou wilt tell us, and acknowledge the agreement

105
00:10:03,817 --> 00:10:14,15
 which thou hast made with him

106
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:16,114
21 But Nephi said unto them: O ye fools, ye

107
00:10:16,114 --> 00:10:17,914
 uncircumcised of heart, ye blind, and ye stiffnecked

108
00:10:17,914 --> 00:10:19,714
 people, do ye know how long the Lord your God will

109
00:10:19,714 --> 00:10:21,514
 suffer you that ye shall go on in this your way of

110
00:10:21,514 --> 00:10:23,314
 sin

111
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:29,856
22 O ye ought to begin to howl and mourn, because

112
00:10:29,856 --> 00:10:36,189
 of the great destruction which at this time doth

113
00:10:36,189 --> 00:10:42,522
 await you, except ye shall repent

114
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:48,004
23 Behold ye say that I have agreed with a man

115
00:10:48,004 --> 00:10:53,433
 that he should murder Seezoram, our chief judge. But

116
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:58,862
 behold, I say unto you, that this is because I

117
00:10:58,862 --> 00:11:04,291
 have testified unto you that ye might know concerning

118
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:09,72
 this thing; yea, even for a witness unto you,

119
00:11:09,72 --> 00:11:15,149
 that I did know of the wickedness and abominations

120
00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:20,578
 which are among you

121
00:11:20,18 --> 00:11:25,68
24 And because I have done this, ye say that I

122
00:11:25,68 --> 00:11:31,18
 have agreed with a man that he should do this thing;

123
00:11:31,18 --> 00:11:36,68
 yea, because I showed unto you this sign ye are

124
00:11:36,68 --> 00:11:42,18
 angry with me, and seek to destroy my life

125
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:47,336
25 And now behold, I will show unto you another

126
00:11:47,336 --> 00:11:52,003
 sign, and see if ye will in this thing seek to

127
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:56,67
 destroy me

128
00:11:56,482 --> 00:12:01,482
26 Behold I say unto you: Go to the house of

129
00:12:01,482 --> 00:12:06,482
 Seantum, who is the brother of Seezoram, and say unto

130
00:12:06,482 --> 00:12:11,482
 him

131
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:17,231
27 Has Nephi, the pretended prophet, who doth

132
00:12:17,231 --> 00:12:22,731
 prophesy so much evil concerning this people, agreed

133
00:12:22,731 --> 00:12:28,231
 with thee, in the which ye have murdered Seezoram,

134
00:12:28,231 --> 00:12:33,731
 who is your brother

135
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:38,453
28 And behold, he shall say unto you, Nay

136
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:41,391
29 And ye shall say unto him: Have ye murdered

137
00:12:41,391 --> 00:12:44,391
 your brother

138
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:49,748
30 And he shall stand with fear, and wist not what

139
00:12:49,748 --> 00:12:54,498
 to say. And behold, he shall deny unto you; and

140
00:12:54,498 --> 00:12:59,248
 he shall make as if he were astonished;

141
00:12:59,248 --> 00:13:03,998
 nevertheless, he shall declare unto you that he is innocent

142
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:09,383
31 But behold, ye shall examine him, and ye shall

143
00:13:09,383 --> 00:13:15,383
 find blood upon the skirts of his cloak

144
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:21,128
32 And when ye have seen this, ye shall say: From

145
00:13:21,128 --> 00:13:26,795
 whence cometh this blood? Do we not know that it

146
00:13:26,795 --> 00:13:32,462
 is the blood of your brother

147
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:37,045
33 And then shall he tremble, and shall look pale,

148
00:13:37,045 --> 00:13:42,045
 even as if death had come upon him

149
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:48,556
34 And then shall ye say: Because of this fear and

150
00:13:48,556 --> 00:13:54,223
 this paleness which has come upon your face,

151
00:13:54,223 --> 00:13:59,89
 behold, we know that thou art guilty

152
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:05,739
35 And then shall greater fear come upon him; and

153
00:14:05,739 --> 00:14:11,739
 then shall he confess unto you, and deny no more

154
00:14:11,739 --> 00:14:17,739
 that he has done this murder

155
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:23,724
36 And then shall he say unto you, that I, Nephi,

156
00:14:23,724 --> 00:14:29,524
 know nothing concerning the matter save it were

157
00:14:29,524 --> 00:14:35,324
 given unto me by the power of God. And then shall ye

158
00:14:35,324 --> 00:14:41,124
 know that I am an honest man, and that I am sent

159
00:14:41,124 --> 00:14:46,924
 unto you from God

160
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:52,119
37 And it came to pass that they went and did,

161
00:14:52,119 --> 00:14:57,319
 even according as Nephi had said unto them. And

162
00:14:57,319 --> 00:15:02,519
 behold, the words which he had said were true; for

163
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:07,719
 according to the words he did deny; and also according

164
00:15:07,719 --> 00:15:12,919
 to the words he did confess

165
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:18,312
38 And he was brought to prove that he himself was

166
00:15:18,312 --> 00:15:23,645
 the very murderer, insomuch that the five were

167
00:15:23,645 --> 00:15:28,978
 set at liberty, and also was Nephi

168
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:33,528
39 And there were some of the Nephites who

169
00:15:33,528 --> 00:15:38,128
 believed on the words of Nephi; and there were some also,

170
00:15:38,128 --> 00:15:42,728
 who believed because of the testimony of the

171
00:15:42,728 --> 00:15:47,328
 five, for they had been converted while they were in

172
00:15:47,328 --> 00:15:51,928
 prison

173
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:57,918
40 And now there were some among the people, who

174
00:15:57,918 --> 00:16:03,918
 said that Nephi was a prophet

175
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:09,896
41 And there were others who said: Behold, he is a

176
00:16:09,896 --> 00:16:15,896
 god, for except he was a god he could not know of

177
00:16:15,896 --> 00:16:21,896
 all things. For behold, he has told us the

178
00:16:21,896 --> 00:16:27,896
 thoughts of our hearts, and also has told us things; and

179
00:16:27,896 --> 00:16:33,896
 even he has brought unto our knowledge the true

180
00:16:33,896 --> 00:16:39,896
 murderer of our chief judge.
