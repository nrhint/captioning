00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 9 Messengers find the chief judge

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
dead at the judgment seat—They are imprisoned

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and later released—By inspiration Nephi

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
identifies Seantum as the murderer—Nephi is

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:03:45,
accepted by some as a prophet. About 23–21 B.C. 

6
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
1 Behold, now it came to pass that when

7
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
Nephi had spoken these words, certain men

8
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
who were among them ran to the

9
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
judgment-seat; yea, even there were five who went,

10
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:17,
and they said among themselves, as they went:

11
00:03:17,0 --> 00:03:17,0
2 Behold, now we will know of a surety

12
00:03:17,0 --> 00:03:17,0
whether this man be a prophet and God

13
00:03:17,0 --> 00:03:17,0
hath commanded him to prophesy such

14
00:03:17,0 --> 00:03:17,0
marvelous things unto us. Behold, we do not

15
00:03:17,0 --> 00:03:17,0
believe that he hath; yea, we do not

16
00:03:17,0 --> 00:03:17,0
believe that he is a prophet;

17
00:03:17,0 --> 00:03:17,0
nevertheless, if this thing which he has said

18
00:03:17,0 --> 00:03:17,0
concerning the chief judge be true, that

19
00:03:17,0 --> 00:03:17,0
he be dead, then will we believe that

20
00:03:17,0 --> 00:07:16,
the other words which he has spoken are true.

21
00:07:16,0 --> 00:07:16,0
3 And it came to pass that they

22
00:07:16,0 --> 00:07:16,0
ran in their might, and came in

23
00:07:16,0 --> 00:07:16,0
unto the judgment-seat; and behold,

24
00:07:16,0 --> 00:07:16,0
the chief judge had fallen to

25
00:07:16,0 --> 00:08:28,
the earth, and did lie in his blood.

26
00:08:28,0 --> 00:08:28,0
4 And now behold, when they saw

27
00:08:28,0 --> 00:08:28,0
this they were astonished

28
00:08:28,0 --> 00:08:28,0
exceedingly, insomuch that they fell

29
00:08:28,0 --> 00:08:28,0
to the earth; for they had not

30
00:08:28,0 --> 00:08:28,0
believed the words which Nephi had

31
00:08:28,0 --> 00:08:00,
spoken concerning the chief judge.

32
00:08:00,0 --> 00:08:00,0
5 But now, when they saw

33
00:08:00,0 --> 00:08:00,0
they believed, and fear came

34
00:08:00,0 --> 00:08:00,0
upon them lest all the

35
00:08:00,0 --> 00:08:00,0
judgments which Nephi had

36
00:08:00,0 --> 00:08:00,0
spoken should come upon the

37
00:08:00,0 --> 00:08:00,0
people; therefore they did

38
00:08:00,0 --> 00:07:32,
quake, and had fallen to the earth.

39
00:07:32,0 --> 00:07:32,0
6 Now, immediately when

40
00:07:32,0 --> 00:07:32,0
the judge had been

41
00:07:32,0 --> 00:07:32,0
murdered—he being stabbed by

42
00:07:32,0 --> 00:07:32,0
his brother by a garb of

43
00:07:32,0 --> 00:07:32,0
secrecy, and he fled,

44
00:07:32,0 --> 00:07:32,0
and the servants ran and

45
00:07:32,0 --> 00:07:32,0
told the people, raising

46
00:07:32,0 --> 00:11:03,
the cry of murder among them;

47
00:11:03,0 --> 00:11:03,0
7 And behold the

48
00:11:03,0 --> 00:11:03,0
people did gather

49
00:11:03,0 --> 00:11:03,0
themselves together unto the

50
00:11:03,0 --> 00:11:03,0
place of the

51
00:11:03,0 --> 00:11:03,0
judgment-seat—and behold, to

52
00:11:03,0 --> 00:11:03,0
their astonishment they

53
00:11:03,0 --> 00:11:03,0
saw those five men who

54
00:11:03,0 --> 00:10:35,
had fallen to the earth.

55
00:10:35,0 --> 00:10:35,0
8 And now behold, the

56
00:10:35,0 --> 00:10:35,0
people knew nothing

57
00:10:35,0 --> 00:10:35,0
concerning the

58
00:10:35,0 --> 00:10:35,0
multitude who had gathered

59
00:10:35,0 --> 00:10:35,0
together at the

60
00:10:35,0 --> 00:10:35,0
garden of Nephi; therefore

61
00:10:35,0 --> 00:10:35,0
they said among

62
00:10:35,0 --> 00:10:35,0
themselves: These men are

63
00:10:35,0 --> 00:10:35,0
they who have

64
00:10:35,0 --> 00:10:35,0
murdered the judge, and God

65
00:10:35,0 --> 00:10:35,0
has smitten them

66
00:10:35,0 --> 00:12:47,
that they could not flee from us.

67
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
9 And it came to

68
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
pass that they laid

69
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
hold on them, and bound

70
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
them and cast them

71
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
into prison. And

72
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
there was a

73
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
proclamation sent abroad that

74
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
the judge was slain,

75
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
and that the

76
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
murderers had been taken

77
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,
and were cast into prison.

78
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
10 And it came to

79
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
pass that on the

80
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
morrow the people

81
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
did assemble

82
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
themselves together to

83
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
mourn and to fast,

84
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
at the burial of

85
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
the great chief

86
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,
judge who had been slain.

87
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
11 And thus also

88
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
those judges who

89
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
were at the garden

90
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
of Nephi, and heard

91
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
his words, were

92
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
also gathered

93
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,
together at the burial.

94
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
12 And it came to

95
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
pass that they

96
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
inquired among the

97
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
people, saying:

98
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
Where are the

99
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
five who were sent

100
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
to inquire

101
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
concerning the chief

102
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
judge whether he was

103
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
dead? And they

104
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
answered and said:

105
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
Concerning this

106
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
five whom ye say

107
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
ye have sent, we

108
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
know not; but

109
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
there are five who

110
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
are the murderers,

111
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,
whom we have cast into prison.

112
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
13 And it came

113
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
to pass that the

114
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
judges desired

115
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
that they should

116
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
be brought; and

117
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
they were

118
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
brought, and behold

119
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
they were the five

120
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
who were sent;

121
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
and behold the

122
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
judges inquired

123
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
of them to know

124
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
concerning the

125
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
matter, and they

126
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
told them all

127
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,
that they had done, saying:

128
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
14 We ran and

129
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
came to the

130
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
place of the

131
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
judgment-seat, and

132
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
when we saw all

133
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
things even as

134
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
Nephi had

135
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
testified, we were

136
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
astonished

137
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
insomuch that we fell

138
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
to the earth;

139
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
and when we

140
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
were recovered

141
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
from our

142
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
astonishment, behold

143
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,
they cast us into prison.

144
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
15 Now, as for

145
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
the murder of

146
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
this man, we

147
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
know not who

148
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
has done it;

149
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
and only this

150
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
much we know, we

151
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
ran and came

152
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
according as

153
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
ye desired, and

154
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
behold he was

155
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
dead,

156
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,
according to the words of Nephi.

157
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
16 And now it

158
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
came to pass

159
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
that the

160
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
judges did

161
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
expound the matter

162
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
unto the

163
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
people, and did

164
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
cry out

165
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
against Nephi,

166
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
saying: Behold,

167
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
we know that

168
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
this Nephi

169
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
must have

170
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
agreed with some

171
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
one to slay

172
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
the judge, and

173
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
then he might

174
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
declare it

175
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
unto us, that

176
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
he might

177
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
convert us unto

178
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
his faith,

179
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
that he might

180
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
raise himself

181
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
to be a great

182
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,
man, chosen of God, and a prophet.

183
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
17 And now

184
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
behold, we will

185
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
detect this

186
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
man, and he

187
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
shall confess

188
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
his fault and

189
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
make known

190
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
unto us the

191
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
true murderer

192
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,
of this judge.

193
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
18 And it

194
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
came to pass

195
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
that the five

196
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
were

197
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
liberated on the

198
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
day of the

199
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
burial.

200
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
Nevertheless, they

201
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
did rebuke

202
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
the judges

203
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
in the words

204
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
which they

205
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
had spoken

206
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
against Nephi,

207
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
and did

208
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
contend with

209
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
them one by

210
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
one, insomuch

211
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,
that they did confound them.

212
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
19

213
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
Nevertheless, they

214
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
caused that

215
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
Nephi

216
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
should be taken

217
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
and bound

218
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
and brought

219
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
before the

220
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
multitude,

221
00:12:47,0 --> 00:12:47,0
