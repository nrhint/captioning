00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:30,5
The Book of EnosChapter 1 Enos prays mightily and

2
00:00:30,5 --> 00:01:01,0
 gains a remission of his sins—The voice of the

3
00:01:01,0 --> 00:01:31,5
 Lord comes into his mind, promising salvation for the

4
00:01:31,5 --> 00:02:02,0
 Lamanites in a future day—The Nephites sought to

5
00:02:02,0 --> 00:02:32,5
 reclaim the Lamanites—Enos rejoices in his

6
00:02:32,5 --> 00:03:03,0
 Redeemer. About 420 B.C.

7
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:24,217
1 Behold, it came to pass that I, Enos, knowing my

8
00:03:24,217 --> 00:03:45,017
 father that he was a just man—for he taught me in

9
00:03:45,017 --> 00:04:05,817
 his language, and also in the nurture and

10
00:04:05,817 --> 00:04:26,617
 admonition of the Lord—and blessed be the name of my God

11
00:04:26,617 --> 00:04:47,417
 for it

12
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,754
2 And I will tell you of the wrestle which I had

13
00:04:49,754 --> 00:04:52,421
 before God, before I received a remission of my

14
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:55,088
 sins

15
00:04:55,061 --> 00:05:12,811
3 Behold, I went to hunt beasts in the forests;

16
00:05:12,811 --> 00:05:30,561
 and the words which I had often heard my father

17
00:05:30,561 --> 00:05:48,311
 speak concerning eternal life, and the joy of the

18
00:05:48,311 --> 00:06:06,061
 saints, sunk deep into my heart

19
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:10,833
4 And my soul hungered; and I kneeled down before

20
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:14,833
 my Maker, and I cried unto him in mighty prayer

21
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:18,833
 and supplication for mine own soul; and all the day

22
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:22,833
 long did I cry unto him; yea, and when the night

23
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:26,833
 came I did still raise my voice high that it

24
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:30,833
 reached the heavens

25
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:33,424
5 And there came a voice unto me, saying: Enos,

26
00:06:33,424 --> 00:06:36,091
 thy sins are forgiven thee, and thou shalt be

27
00:06:36,091 --> 00:06:38,758
 blessed

28
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:42,732
6 And I, Enos, knew that God could not lie;

29
00:06:42,732 --> 00:06:46,732
 wherefore, my guilt was swept away

30
00:06:46,706 --> 00:07:34,706
7 And I said: Lord, how is it done

31
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:37,754
8 And he said unto me: Because of thy faith in

32
00:07:37,754 --> 00:07:40,954
 Christ, whom thou hast never before heard nor seen.

33
00:07:40,954 --> 00:07:44,154
 And many years pass away before he shall manifest

34
00:07:44,154 --> 00:07:47,354
 himself in the flesh; wherefore, go to, thy faith

35
00:07:47,354 --> 00:07:50,554
 hath made thee whole

36
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:52,503
9 Now, it came to pass that when I had heard these

37
00:07:52,503 --> 00:07:54,503
 words I began to feel a desire for the welfare of

38
00:07:54,503 --> 00:07:56,503
 my brethren, the Nephites; wherefore, I did pour

39
00:07:56,503 --> 00:07:58,503
 out my whole soul unto God for them

40
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:03,811
10 And while I was thus struggling in the spirit,

41
00:08:03,811 --> 00:08:09,144
 behold, the voice of the Lord came into my mind

42
00:08:09,144 --> 00:08:14,477
 again, saying: I will visit thy brethren according

43
00:08:14,477 --> 00:08:19,81
 to their diligence in keeping my commandments. I

44
00:08:19,81 --> 00:08:25,143
 have given unto them this land, and it is a holy

45
00:08:25,143 --> 00:08:30,476
 land; and I curse it not save it be for the cause of

46
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:35,809
 iniquity; wherefore, I will visit thy brethren

47
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:41,142
 according as I have said; and their transgressions

48
00:08:41,142 --> 00:08:46,475
 will I bring down with sorrow upon their own heads

49
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:54,326
11 And after I, Enos, had heard these words, my

50
00:08:54,326 --> 00:09:02,326
 faith began to be unshaken in the Lord; and I prayed

51
00:09:02,326 --> 00:09:10,326
 unto him with many long strugglings for my

52
00:09:10,326 --> 00:09:18,326
 brethren, the Lamanites

53
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:26,224
12 And it came to pass that after I had prayed and

54
00:09:26,224 --> 00:09:34,224
 labored with all diligence, the Lord said unto

55
00:09:34,224 --> 00:09:42,224
 me: I will grant unto thee according to thy desires,

56
00:09:42,224 --> 00:09:50,224
 because of thy faith

57
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:51,723
13 And now behold, this was the desire which I

58
00:09:51,723 --> 00:09:53,323
 desired of him—that if it should so be, that my

59
00:09:53,323 --> 00:09:54,923
 people, the Nephites, should fall into transgression,

60
00:09:54,923 --> 00:09:56,523
 and by any means be destroyed, and the Lamanites

61
00:09:56,523 --> 00:09:58,123
 should not be destroyed, that the Lord God would

62
00:09:58,123 --> 00:09:59,723
 preserve a record of my people, the Nephites; even if

63
00:09:59,723 --> 00:10:01,323
 it so be by the power of his holy arm, that it

64
00:10:01,323 --> 00:10:02,923
 might be brought forth at some future day unto the

65
00:10:02,923 --> 00:10:04,523
 Lamanites, that, perhaps, they might be brought

66
00:10:04,523 --> 00:10:06,123
 unto salvation

67
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:26,672
14 For at the present our strugglings were vain in

68
00:10:26,672 --> 00:10:47,272
 restoring them to the true faith. And they swore

69
00:10:47,272 --> 00:11:07,872
 in their wrath that, if it were possible, they

70
00:11:07,872 --> 00:11:28,472
 would destroy our records and us, and also all the

71
00:11:28,472 --> 00:11:49,072
 traditions of our fathers

72
00:11:49,742 --> 00:12:04,142
15 Wherefore, I knowing that the Lord God was able

73
00:12:04,142 --> 00:12:18,542
 to preserve our records, I cried unto him

74
00:12:18,542 --> 00:12:32,942
 continually, for he had said unto me: Whatsoever thing ye

75
00:12:32,942 --> 00:12:47,342
 shall ask in faith, believing that ye shall

76
00:12:47,342 --> 00:13:01,742
 receive in the name of Christ, ye shall receive it

77
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:43,264
16 And I had faith, and I did cry unto God that he

78
00:13:43,264 --> 00:14:25,014
 would preserve the records; and he covenanted

79
00:14:25,014 --> 00:15:06,764
 with me that he would bring them forth unto the

80
00:15:06,764 --> 00:15:48,514
 Lamanites in his own due time

81
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:29,417
19 And now it came to pass that I, Enos, went

82
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:55,417
 about among the people of Nephi, prophesying of things

83
00:03:55,417 --> 00:04:21,417
 to come, and testifying of the things which I had

84
00:04:21,417 --> 00:04:47,417
 heard and seen

85
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:47,702
20 And I bear record that the people of Nephi did

86
00:04:47,702 --> 00:04:48,317
 seek diligently to restore the Lamanites unto the

87
00:04:48,317 --> 00:04:48,932
 true faith in God. But our labors were vain; their

88
00:04:48,932 --> 00:04:49,547
 hatred was fixed, and they were led by their evil

89
00:04:49,547 --> 00:04:50,162
 nature that they became wild, and ferocious, and

90
00:04:50,162 --> 00:04:50,777
 a blood-thirsty people, full of idolatry and

91
00:04:50,777 --> 00:04:51,392
 filthiness; feeding upon beasts of prey; dwelling in

92
00:04:51,392 --> 00:04:52,007
 tents, and wandering about in the wilderness with a

93
00:04:52,007 --> 00:04:52,622
 short skin girdle about their loins and their

94
00:04:52,622 --> 00:04:53,237
 heads shaven; and their skill was in the bow, and in

95
00:04:53,237 --> 00:04:53,852
 the cimeter, and the ax. And many of them did eat

96
00:04:53,852 --> 00:04:54,467
 nothing save it was raw meat; and they were

97
00:04:54,467 --> 00:04:55,082
 continually seeking to destroy us

98
00:04:55,061 --> 00:05:09,261
21 And it came to pass that the people of Nephi

99
00:05:09,261 --> 00:05:23,461
 did till the land, and raise all manner of grain,

100
00:05:23,461 --> 00:05:37,661
 and of fruit, and flocks of herds, and flocks of all

101
00:05:37,661 --> 00:05:51,861
 manner of cattle of every kind, and goats, and

102
00:05:51,861 --> 00:06:06,061
 wild goats, and also many horses

103
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:14,833
22 And there were exceedingly many prophets among

104
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:22,833
 us. And the people were a stiffnecked people, hard

105
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:30,833
 to understand

106
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:31,484
23 And there was nothing save it was exceeding

107
00:06:31,484 --> 00:06:32,211
 harshness, preaching and prophesying of wars, and

108
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:32,938
 contentions, and destructions, and continually

109
00:06:32,938 --> 00:06:33,665
 reminding them of death, and the duration of eternity,

110
00:06:33,665 --> 00:06:34,392
 and the judgments and the power of God, and all

111
00:06:34,392 --> 00:06:35,119
 these things—stirring them up continually to keep

112
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:35,846
 them in the fear of the Lord. I say there was nothing

113
00:06:35,846 --> 00:06:36,573
 short of these things, and exceedingly great

114
00:06:36,573 --> 00:06:37,3
 plainness of speech, would keep them from going down

115
00:06:37,3 --> 00:06:38,027
 speedily to destruction. And after this manner do I

116
00:06:38,027 --> 00:06:38,754
 write concerning them

117
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:42,732
24 And I saw wars between the Nephites and

118
00:06:42,732 --> 00:06:46,732
 Lamanites in the course of my days

119
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:58,706
25 And it came to pass that I began to be old, and

120
00:06:58,706 --> 00:07:10,706
 an hundred and seventy and nine years had passed

121
00:07:10,706 --> 00:07:22,706
 away from the time that our father Lehi left

122
00:07:22,706 --> 00:07:34,706
 Jerusalem

123
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:37,221
26 And I saw that I must soon go down to my grave,

124
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:39,888
 having been wrought upon by the power of God that

125
00:07:39,888 --> 00:07:42,555
 I must preach and prophesy unto this people, and

126
00:07:42,555 --> 00:07:45,222
 declare the word according to the truth which is

127
00:07:45,222 --> 00:07:47,889
 in Christ. And I have declared it in all my days,

128
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:50,556
 and have rejoiced in it above that of the world

129
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:50,628
27 And I soon go to the place of my rest, which is

130
00:07:50,628 --> 00:07:50,753
 with my Redeemer; for I know that in him I shall

131
00:07:50,753 --> 00:07:50,878
 rest. And I rejoice in the day when my mortal

132
00:07:50,878 --> 00:07:51,003
 shall put on immortality, and shall stand before him;

133
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:51,128
 then shall I see his face with pleasure, and he

134
00:07:51,128 --> 00:07:51,253
 will say unto me: Come unto me, ye blessed, there is

135
00:07:51,253 --> 00:07:51,378
 a place prepared for you in the mansions of my

136
00:07:51,378 --> 00:07:51,503
 Father. Amen.
