00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,5
The Book of EnosChapter 1 Enos prays

2
00:00:01,5 --> 00:00:03,0
mightily and gains a remission of his sins—The

3
00:00:03,0 --> 00:00:04,5
voice of the Lord comes into his mind, promising

4
00:00:04,5 --> 00:00:06,0
salvation for the Lamanites in a future

5
00:00:06,0 --> 00:00:07,5
day—The Nephites sought to reclaim the

6
00:00:07,5 --> 00:00:09,443
Lamanites—Enos rejoices in his Redeemer. About 420 B.C. 

7
00:00:09,443 --> 00:00:12,243
1 Behold, it came to pass that I, Enos,

8
00:00:12,243 --> 00:00:15,043
knowing my father that he was a just

9
00:00:15,043 --> 00:00:17,843
man—for he taught me in his language, and also

10
00:00:17,843 --> 00:00:20,643
in the nurture and admonition of the

11
00:00:20,643 --> 00:00:23,757
Lord—and blessed be the name of my God for it—

12
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:30,09
2 And I will tell you of the

13
00:00:30,09 --> 00:00:36,423
wrestle which I had before God, before

14
00:00:36,423 --> 00:00:42,075
I received a remission of my sins.

15
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:43,242
3 Behold, I went to hunt

16
00:00:43,242 --> 00:00:44,409
beasts in the forests; and the

17
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:45,576
words which I had often heard

18
00:00:45,576 --> 00:00:46,743
my father speak concerning

19
00:00:46,743 --> 00:00:47,91
eternal life, and the joy of the

20
00:00:47,91 --> 00:00:49,116
saints, sunk deep into my heart.

21
00:00:49,116 --> 00:00:51,416
4 And my soul hungered;

22
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:53,716
and I kneeled down before my

23
00:00:53,716 --> 00:00:56,016
Maker, and I cried unto

24
00:00:56,016 --> 00:00:58,316
him in mighty prayer and

25
00:00:58,316 --> 00:01:00,616
supplication for mine own

26
00:01:00,616 --> 00:01:02,916
soul; and all the day long

27
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:05,216
did I cry unto him; yea,

28
00:01:05,216 --> 00:01:07,516
and when the night came I

29
00:01:07,516 --> 00:01:09,816
did still raise my voice

30
00:01:09,816 --> 00:01:12,573
high that it reached the heavens.

31
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
5 And there came a voice

32
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
unto me, saying: Enos,

33
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
thy sins are forgiven thee,

34
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
and thou shalt be blessed.

35
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
6 And I, Enos, knew

36
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
that God could not

37
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
lie; wherefore, my

38
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
guilt was swept away.

39
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
7 And I said:

40
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
Lord, how is it done?

41
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
8 And he said

42
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
unto me: Because

43
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
of thy faith in

44
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
Christ, whom thou

45
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
hast never

46
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
before heard nor

47
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
seen. And many

48
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
years pass away

49
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
before he shall

50
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
manifest himself in

51
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
the flesh;

52
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
wherefore, go to, thy

53
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
faith hath made thee whole.

54
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
9 Now, it came

55
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
to pass that

56
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
when I had heard

57
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
these words I

58
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
began to feel a

59
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
desire for the

60
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
welfare of my

61
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
brethren, the

62
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
Nephites;

63
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
wherefore, I did pour

64
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
out my whole

65
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
soul unto God for them.

66
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
10 And while I

67
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
was thus

68
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
struggling in the

69
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
spirit,

70
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
behold, the voice of

71
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
the Lord came

72
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
into my mind

73
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
again, saying:

74
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
I will visit

75
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
thy brethren

76
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
according to

77
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
their diligence

78
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
in keeping my

79
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
commandments.

80
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
I have given

81
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
unto them this

82
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
land, and it

83
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
is a holy land;

84
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
and I curse

85
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
it not save it

86
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
be for the

87
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
cause of

88
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
iniquity; wherefore, I

89
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
will visit

90
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
thy brethren

91
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
according as I

92
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
have said; and

93
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
their

94
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
transgressions will I

95
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
bring down with sorrow upon their own heads.

96
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
11 And after

97
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
I, Enos, had

98
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
heard these

99
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
words, my faith

100
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
began to be

101
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
unshaken in the

102
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
Lord; and I

103
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
prayed unto him

104
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
with many long

105
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
strugglings for

106
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
my brethren,

107
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
the Lamanites.

108
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
12 And it

109
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
came to pass

110
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
that after I had

111
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
prayed and

112
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
labored with

113
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
all diligence,

114
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
the Lord

115
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
said unto me: I

116
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
will grant

117
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
unto thee

118
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
according to thy

119
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
desires,

120
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
because of thy faith.

121
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
13 And now

122
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
behold, this

123
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
was the

124
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
desire which I

125
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
desired of

126
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
him—that if it

127
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
should so

128
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
be, that my

129
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
people, the

130
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
Nephites,

131
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
should fall

132
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
into

133
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
transgression, and by

134
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
any means be

135
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
destroyed,

136
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
and the

137
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
Lamanites should

138
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
not be

139
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
destroyed, that

140
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
the Lord God

141
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
would

142
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
preserve a record

143
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
of my

144
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
people, the

145
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
Nephites; even if

146
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
it so be by

147
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
the power

148
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
of his holy

149
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
arm, that it

150
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
might be

151
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
brought forth

152
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
at some

153
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
future day unto

154
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
the

155
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
Lamanites, that,

156
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
perhaps, they might be brought unto salvation—

157
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
14 For at

158
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
the present

159
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
our

160
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
strugglings were

161
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
vain in

162
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
restoring them

163
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
to the true

164
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
faith. And

165
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
they swore

166
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
in their

167
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
wrath that,

168
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
if it were

169
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
possible,

170
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
they would

171
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
destroy our

172
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
records and

173
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
us, and

174
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
also all the

175
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
traditions of our fathers.

176
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
15

177
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
Wherefore, I

178
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
knowing that

179
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
the Lord

180
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
God was able

181
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
to

182
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
preserve our

183
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
records, I

184
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
cried unto

185
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
him

186
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
continually, for

187
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
he had

188
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
said unto me:

189
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573


190
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
Whatsoever thing ye

191
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
shall ask

192
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
in faith,

193
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
believing

194
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
that ye

195
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
shall

196
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
receive in the

197
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
name of

198
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
Christ, ye shall receive it.

199
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
16 And I

200
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
had

201
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
faith, and I

202
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
did cry

203
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
unto God

204
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
that he

205
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
would

206
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
preserve the

207
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
records;

208
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
and he

209
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
covenanted

210
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
with me

211
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
that he

212
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
would bring

213
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
them forth

214
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
unto the

215
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573


216
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
Lamanites in his own due time.

217
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
17 And

218
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
I, Enos,

219
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
knew it

220
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
would be

221
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573


222
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
according to

223
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
the

224
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
covenant which

225
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
he had

226
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
made;

227
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
wherefore

228
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
my soul did rest.

229
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
18 And

230
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
the

231
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573

232
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
unto

233
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
me: Thy

234
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
fathers

235
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573

236
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573

238
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573

this

240
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
thing; and

241
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
it shall

242
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
be

243
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
done unto

244
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
them

245
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
according

246
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573

00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573

250
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
faith was like unto thine.

251
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
19 And

252
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
now

253
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
it came

254
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573

268
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573

276
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
And I

00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
God.

299
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
But

300
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
our

301
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573

302
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
were

303
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573

307
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573

308
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
fixed,

309
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:12,573
