00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
The Book of EnosChapter 1 Enos prays

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
mightily and gains a remission of his sins—The

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
voice of the Lord comes into his mind, promising

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
salvation for the Lamanites in a future

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
day—The Nephites sought to reclaim the

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:03:31,
Lamanites—Enos rejoices in his Redeemer. About 420 B.C. 

7
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
1 Behold, it came to pass that I, Enos,

8
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
knowing my father that he was a just

9
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
man—for he taught me in his language, and also

10
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
in the nurture and admonition of the

11
00:03:31,0 --> 00:05:01,
Lord—and blessed be the name of my God for it—

12
00:05:01,0 --> 00:05:01,0
2 And I will tell you of the

13
00:05:01,0 --> 00:05:01,0
wrestle which I had before God, before

14
00:05:01,0 --> 00:09:13,
I received a remission of my sins.

15
00:09:13,0 --> 00:09:13,0
3 Behold, I went to hunt

16
00:09:13,0 --> 00:09:13,0
beasts in the forests; and the

17
00:09:13,0 --> 00:09:13,0
words which I had often heard

18
00:09:13,0 --> 00:09:13,0
my father speak concerning

19
00:09:13,0 --> 00:09:13,0
eternal life, and the joy of the

20
00:09:13,0 --> 00:11:25,
saints, sunk deep into my heart.

21
00:11:25,0 --> 00:11:25,0
4 And my soul hungered;

22
00:11:25,0 --> 00:11:25,0
and I kneeled down before my

23
00:11:25,0 --> 00:11:25,0
Maker, and I cried unto

24
00:11:25,0 --> 00:11:25,0
him in mighty prayer and

25
00:11:25,0 --> 00:11:25,0
supplication for mine own

26
00:11:25,0 --> 00:11:25,0
soul; and all the day long

27
00:11:25,0 --> 00:11:25,0
did I cry unto him; yea,

28
00:11:25,0 --> 00:11:25,0
and when the night came I

29
00:11:25,0 --> 00:11:25,0
did still raise my voice

30
00:11:25,0 --> 00:19:22,
high that it reached the heavens.

31
00:19:22,0 --> 00:19:22,0
5 And there came a voice

32
00:19:22,0 --> 00:19:22,0
unto me, saying: Enos,

33
00:19:22,0 --> 00:19:22,0
thy sins are forgiven thee,

34
00:19:22,0 --> 00:18:54,
and thou shalt be blessed.

35
00:18:54,0 --> 00:18:54,0
6 And I, Enos, knew

36
00:18:54,0 --> 00:18:54,0
that God could not

37
00:18:54,0 --> 00:18:54,0
lie; wherefore, my

38
00:18:54,0 --> 00:19:24,
guilt was swept away.

39
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
7 And I said:

40
00:19:24,0 --> 00:18:56,
Lord, how is it done?

41
00:18:56,0 --> 00:18:56,0
8 And he said

42
00:18:56,0 --> 00:18:56,0
unto me: Because

43
00:18:56,0 --> 00:18:56,0
of thy faith in

44
00:18:56,0 --> 00:18:56,0
Christ, whom thou

45
00:18:56,0 --> 00:18:56,0
hast never

46
00:18:56,0 --> 00:18:56,0
before heard nor

47
00:18:56,0 --> 00:18:56,0
seen. And many

48
00:18:56,0 --> 00:18:56,0
years pass away

49
00:18:56,0 --> 00:18:56,0
before he shall

50
00:18:56,0 --> 00:18:56,0
manifest himself in

51
00:18:56,0 --> 00:18:56,0
the flesh;

52
00:18:56,0 --> 00:18:56,0
wherefore, go to, thy

53
00:18:56,0 --> 00:22:55,
faith hath made thee whole.

54
00:22:55,0 --> 00:22:55,0
9 Now, it came

55
00:22:55,0 --> 00:22:55,0
to pass that

56
00:22:55,0 --> 00:22:55,0
when I had heard

57
00:22:55,0 --> 00:22:55,0
these words I

58
00:22:55,0 --> 00:22:55,0
began to feel a

59
00:22:55,0 --> 00:22:55,0
desire for the

60
00:22:55,0 --> 00:22:55,0
welfare of my

61
00:22:55,0 --> 00:22:55,0
brethren, the

62
00:22:55,0 --> 00:22:55,0
Nephites;

63
00:22:55,0 --> 00:22:55,0
wherefore, I did pour

64
00:22:55,0 --> 00:22:55,0
out my whole

65
00:22:55,0 --> 00:22:27,
soul unto God for them.

66
00:22:27,0 --> 00:22:27,0
10 And while I

67
00:22:27,0 --> 00:22:27,0
was thus

68
00:22:27,0 --> 00:22:27,0
struggling in the

69
00:22:27,0 --> 00:22:27,0
spirit,

70
00:22:27,0 --> 00:22:27,0
behold, the voice of

71
00:22:27,0 --> 00:22:27,0
the Lord came

72
00:22:27,0 --> 00:22:27,0
into my mind

73
00:22:27,0 --> 00:22:27,0
again, saying:

74
00:22:27,0 --> 00:22:27,0
I will visit

75
00:22:27,0 --> 00:22:27,0
thy brethren

76
00:22:27,0 --> 00:22:27,0
according to

77
00:22:27,0 --> 00:22:27,0
their diligence

78
00:22:27,0 --> 00:22:27,0
in keeping my

79
00:22:27,0 --> 00:22:27,0
commandments.

80
00:22:27,0 --> 00:22:27,0
I have given

81
00:22:27,0 --> 00:22:27,0
unto them this

82
00:22:27,0 --> 00:22:27,0
land, and it

83
00:22:27,0 --> 00:22:27,0
is a holy land;

84
00:22:27,0 --> 00:22:27,0
and I curse

85
00:22:27,0 --> 00:22:27,0
it not save it

86
00:22:27,0 --> 00:22:27,0
be for the

87
00:22:27,0 --> 00:22:27,0
cause of

88
00:22:27,0 --> 00:22:27,0
iniquity; wherefore, I

89
00:22:27,0 --> 00:22:27,0
will visit

90
00:22:27,0 --> 00:22:27,0
thy brethren

91
00:22:27,0 --> 00:22:27,0
according as I

92
00:22:27,0 --> 00:22:27,0
have said; and

93
00:22:27,0 --> 00:22:27,0
their

94
00:22:27,0 --> 00:22:27,0
transgressions will I

95
00:22:27,0 --> 00:21:59,
bring down with sorrow upon their own heads.

96
00:21:59,0 --> 00:21:59,0
11 And after

97
00:21:59,0 --> 00:21:59,0
I, Enos, had

98
00:21:59,0 --> 00:21:59,0
heard these

99
00:21:59,0 --> 00:21:59,0
words, my faith

100
00:21:59,0 --> 00:21:59,0
began to be

101
00:21:59,0 --> 00:21:59,0
unshaken in the

102
00:21:59,0 --> 00:21:59,0
Lord; and I

103
00:21:59,0 --> 00:21:59,0
prayed unto him

104
00:21:59,0 --> 00:21:59,0
with many long

105
00:21:59,0 --> 00:21:59,0
strugglings for

106
00:21:59,0 --> 00:21:59,0
my brethren,

107
00:21:59,0 --> 00:22:43,
the Lamanites.

108
00:22:43,0 --> 00:22:43,0
12 And it

109
00:22:43,0 --> 00:22:43,0
came to pass

110
00:22:43,0 --> 00:22:43,0
that after I had

111
00:22:43,0 --> 00:22:43,0
prayed and

112
00:22:43,0 --> 00:22:43,0
labored with

113
00:22:43,0 --> 00:22:43,0
all diligence,

114
00:22:43,0 --> 00:22:43,0
the Lord

115
00:22:43,0 --> 00:22:43,0
said unto me: I

116
00:22:43,0 --> 00:22:43,0
will grant

117
00:22:43,0 --> 00:22:43,0
unto thee

118
00:22:43,0 --> 00:22:43,0
according to thy

119
00:22:43,0 --> 00:22:43,0
desires,

120
00:22:43,0 --> 00:22:57,
because of thy faith.

121
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
13 And now

122
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
behold, this

123
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
was the

124
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
desire which I

125
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
desired of

126
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
him—that if it

127
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
should so

128
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
be, that my

129
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
people, the

130
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
Nephites,

131
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
should fall

132
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
into

133
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
transgression, and by

134
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
any means be

135
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
destroyed,

136
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
and the

137
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
Lamanites should

138
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
not be

139
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
destroyed, that

140
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
the Lord God

141
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
would

142
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
preserve a record

143
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
of my

144
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
people, the

145
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
Nephites; even if

146
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
it so be by

147
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
the power

148
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
of his holy

149
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
arm, that it

150
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
might be

151
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
brought forth

152
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
at some

153
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
future day unto

154
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
the

155
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
Lamanites, that,

156
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:29,
perhaps, they might be brought unto salvation—

157
00:22:29,0 --> 00:22:29,0
14 For at

158
00:22:29,0 --> 00:22:29,0
the present

159
00:22:29,0 --> 00:22:29,0
our

160
00:22:29,0 --> 00:22:29,0
strugglings were

161
00:22:29,0 --> 00:22:29,0
vain in

162
00:22:29,0 --> 00:22:29,0
restoring them

163
00:22:29,0 --> 00:22:29,0
to the true

164
00:22:29,0 --> 00:22:29,0
faith. And

165
00:22:29,0 --> 00:22:29,0
they swore

166
00:22:29,0 --> 00:22:29,0
in their

167
00:22:29,0 --> 00:22:29,0
wrath that,

168
00:22:29,0 --> 00:22:29,0
if it were

169
00:22:29,0 --> 00:22:29,0
possible,

170
00:22:29,0 --> 00:22:29,0
they would

171
00:22:29,0 --> 00:22:29,0
destroy our

172
00:22:29,0 --> 00:22:29,0
records and

173
00:22:29,0 --> 00:22:29,0
us, and

174
00:22:29,0 --> 00:22:29,0
also all the

175
00:22:29,0 --> 00:22:15,
traditions of our fathers.

176
00:22:15,0 --> 00:22:15,0
15

177
00:22:15,0 --> 00:22:15,0
Wherefore, I

178
00:22:15,0 --> 00:22:15,0
knowing that

179
00:22:15,0 --> 00:22:15,0
the Lord

180
00:22:15,0 --> 00:22:15,0
God was able

181
00:22:15,0 --> 00:22:15,0
to

182
00:22:15,0 --> 00:22:15,0
preserve our

183
00:22:15,0 --> 00:22:15,0
records, I

184
00:22:15,0 --> 00:22:15,0
cried unto

185
00:22:15,0 --> 00:22:15,0
him

186
00:22:15,0 --> 00:22:15,0
continually, for

187
00:22:15,0 --> 00:22:15,0
he had

188
00:22:15,0 --> 00:22:15,0
said unto me:

189
00:22:15,0 --> 00:22:15,0


190
00:22:15,0 --> 00:22:15,0
Whatsoever thing ye

191
00:22:15,0 --> 00:22:15,0
shall ask

192
00:22:15,0 --> 00:22:15,0
in faith,

193
00:22:15,0 --> 00:22:15,0
believing

194
00:22:15,0 --> 00:22:15,0
that ye

195
00:22:15,0 --> 00:22:15,0
shall

196
00:22:15,0 --> 00:22:15,0
receive in the

197
00:22:15,0 --> 00:22:15,0
name of

198
00:22:15,0 --> 00:22:01,
Christ, ye shall receive it.

199
00:22:01,0 --> 00:22:01,0
16 And I

200
00:22:01,0 --> 00:22:01,0
had

201
00:22:01,0 --> 00:22:01,0
faith, and I

202
00:22:01,0 --> 00:22:01,0
did cry

203
00:22:01,0 --> 00:22:01,0
unto God

204
00:22:01,0 --> 00:22:01,0
that he

205
00:22:01,0 --> 00:22:01,0
would

206
00:22:01,0 --> 00:22:01,0
preserve the

207
00:22:01,0 --> 00:22:01,0
records;

208
00:22:01,0 --> 00:22:01,0
and he

209
00:22:01,0 --> 00:22:01,0
covenanted

210
00:22:01,0 --> 00:22:01,0
with me

211
00:22:01,0 --> 00:22:01,0
that he

212
00:22:01,0 --> 00:22:01,0
would bring

213
00:22:01,0 --> 00:22:01,0
them forth

214
00:22:01,0 --> 00:22:01,0
unto the

215
00:22:01,0 --> 00:22:01,0


216
00:22:01,0 --> 00:21:47,
Lamanites in his own due time.

217
00:21:47,0 --> 00:21:47,0
17 And

218
00:21:47,0 --> 00:21:47,0
I, Enos,

219
00:21:47,0 --> 00:21:47,0
knew it

220
00:21:47,0 --> 00:21:47,0
would be

221
00:21:47,0 --> 00:21:47,0


222
00:21:47,0 --> 00:21:47,0
according to

223
00:21:47,0 --> 00:21:47,0
the

224
00:21:47,0 --> 00:21:47,0
covenant which

225
00:21:47,0 --> 00:21:47,0
