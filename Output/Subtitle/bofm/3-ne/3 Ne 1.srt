00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,154
Third NephiThe Book of Nephi the Son of Nephi,

2
00:00:01,154 --> 00:00:02,308
Who Was the Son of HelamanAnd Helaman was the son

3
00:00:02,308 --> 00:00:03,462
of Helaman, who was the son of Alma, who was

4
00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:04,616
the son of Alma, being a descendant of Nephi who

5
00:00:04,616 --> 00:00:05,77
was the son of Lehi, who came out of Jerusalem in

6
00:00:05,77 --> 00:00:06,924
the first year of the reign of Zedekiah, the

7
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:08,078
king of Judah.Chapter 1 Nephi, the son of Helaman,

8
00:00:08,078 --> 00:00:09,232
departs out of the land, and his son Nephi

9
00:00:09,232 --> 00:00:10,386
keeps the records—Though signs and wonders abound,

10
00:00:10,386 --> 00:00:11,54
the wicked plan to slay the righteous—The night

11
00:00:11,54 --> 00:00:12,694
of Christ’s birth arrives—The sign is given, and

12
00:00:12,694 --> 00:00:13,848
a new star arises—Lyings and deceivings

13
00:00:13,848 --> 00:00:15,482
increase, and the Gadianton robbers slaughter many. About A.D. 1–4. 

14
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:22,282
1 Now it came to pass that the ninety and

15
00:00:22,282 --> 00:00:29,082
first year had passed away and it was six

16
00:00:29,082 --> 00:00:35,882
hundred years from the time that Lehi left

17
00:00:35,882 --> 00:00:42,682
Jerusalem; and it was in the year that Lachoneus was

18
00:00:42,682 --> 00:00:49,75
the chief judge and the governor over the land.

19
00:00:49,75 --> 00:00:49,607
2 And Nephi, the son of Helaman, had

20
00:00:49,607 --> 00:00:49,464
departed out of the land of Zarahemla, giving

21
00:00:49,464 --> 00:00:49,321
charge unto his son Nephi, who was his

22
00:00:49,321 --> 00:00:49,178
eldest son, concerning the plates of brass,

23
00:00:49,178 --> 00:00:49,035
and all the records which had been kept, and

24
00:00:49,035 --> 00:00:48,892
all those things which had been kept

25
00:00:48,892 --> 00:00:48,815
sacred from the departure of Lehi out of Jerusalem.

26
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:48,565
3 Then he departed out of the land, and

27
00:00:48,565 --> 00:00:48,315
whither he went, no man knoweth; and

28
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:48,065
his son Nephi did keep the records in

29
00:00:48,065 --> 00:00:47,881
his stead, yea, the record of this people.

30
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:48,381
4 And it came to pass that in the

31
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:48,881
commencement of the ninety and second

32
00:00:48,881 --> 00:00:49,381
year, behold, the prophecies of the

33
00:00:49,381 --> 00:00:49,881
prophets began to be fulfilled more fully;

34
00:00:49,881 --> 00:00:50,381
for there began to be greater signs and

35
00:00:50,381 --> 00:00:50,284
greater miracles wrought among the people.

36
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:50,034
5 But there were some who began

37
00:00:50,034 --> 00:00:49,784
to say that the time was past for

38
00:00:49,784 --> 00:00:49,534
the words to be fulfilled, which

39
00:00:49,534 --> 00:00:49,349
were spoken by Samuel, the Lamanite.

40
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:49,182
6 And they began to rejoice over

41
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:49,015
their brethren, saying: Behold

42
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:48,848
the time is past, and the words

43
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:48,681
of Samuel are not fulfilled;

44
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:48,514
therefore, your joy and your faith

45
00:00:48,514 --> 00:00:48,415
concerning this thing hath been vain.

46
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:48,272
7 And it came to pass that

47
00:00:48,272 --> 00:00:48,129
they did make a great uproar

48
00:00:48,129 --> 00:00:47,986
throughout the land; and the

49
00:00:47,986 --> 00:00:47,843
people who believed began to be

50
00:00:47,843 --> 00:00:47,7
very sorrowful, lest by any

51
00:00:47,7 --> 00:00:47,557
means those things which had

52
00:00:47,557 --> 00:00:47,481
been spoken might not come to pass.

53
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:47,767
8 But behold, they did

54
00:00:47,767 --> 00:00:48,053
watch steadfastly for that day

55
00:00:48,053 --> 00:00:48,339
and that night and that day

56
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:48,625
which should be as one day

57
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:48,911
as if there were no night,

58
00:00:48,911 --> 00:00:49,197
that they might know that

59
00:00:49,197 --> 00:00:49,883
their faith had not been vain.

60
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,772
9 Now it came to pass

61
00:00:49,772 --> 00:00:49,661
that there was a day set

62
00:00:49,661 --> 00:00:49,55
apart by the unbelievers,

63
00:00:49,55 --> 00:00:49,439
that all those who

64
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:49,328
believed in those traditions

65
00:00:49,328 --> 00:00:49,217
should be put to death

66
00:00:49,217 --> 00:00:49,106
except the sign should

67
00:00:49,106 --> 00:00:48,995
come to pass, which had

68
00:00:48,995 --> 00:00:48,949
been given by Samuel the prophet.

69
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:48,949
10 Now it came to

70
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:48,949
pass that when Nephi,

71
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:48,949
the son of Nephi, saw

72
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:48,949
this wickedness of his

73
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:48,949
people, his heart

74
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:48,015
was exceedingly sorrowful.

75
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:48,182
11 And it came to

76
00:00:48,182 --> 00:00:48,349
pass that he went

77
00:00:48,349 --> 00:00:48,516
out and bowed himself

78
00:00:48,516 --> 00:00:48,683
down upon the

79
00:00:48,683 --> 00:00:48,85
earth, and cried

80
00:00:48,85 --> 00:00:49,017
mightily to his God in

81
00:00:49,017 --> 00:00:49,184
behalf of his people,

82
00:00:49,184 --> 00:00:49,351
yea, those who

83
00:00:49,351 --> 00:00:49,518
were about to be

84
00:00:49,518 --> 00:00:49,685
destroyed because of

85
00:00:49,685 --> 00:00:49,852
their faith in the

86
00:00:49,852 --> 00:00:50,417
tradition of their fathers.

87
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:50,274
12 And it came to

88
00:00:50,274 --> 00:00:50,131
pass that he cried

89
00:00:50,131 --> 00:00:49,988
mightily unto the

90
00:00:49,988 --> 00:00:49,845
Lord all that

91
00:00:49,845 --> 00:00:49,702
day; and behold, the

92
00:00:49,702 --> 00:00:49,559
voice of the Lord

93
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:49,483
came unto him, saying:

94
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:49,421
13 Lift up your

95
00:00:49,421 --> 00:00:49,359
head and be of

96
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:49,297
good cheer; for

97
00:00:49,297 --> 00:00:49,235
behold, the time is

98
00:00:49,235 --> 00:00:49,173
at hand, and on

99
00:00:49,173 --> 00:00:49,111
this night shall

100
00:00:49,111 --> 00:00:49,049
the sign be given,

101
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:48,987
and on the morrow

102
00:00:48,987 --> 00:00:48,925
come I into the

103
00:00:48,925 --> 00:00:48,863
world, to show

104
00:00:48,863 --> 00:00:48,801
unto the world that

105
00:00:48,801 --> 00:00:48,739
I will fulfil

106
00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:48,677
all that which I

107
00:00:48,677 --> 00:00:48,615
have caused to be

108
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:48,553
spoken by the

109
00:00:48,553 --> 00:00:48,549
mouth of my holy prophets.

110
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:48,499
14 Behold, I

111
00:00:48,499 --> 00:00:48,449
come unto my own,

112
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:48,399
to fulfil all

113
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:48,349
things which I have

114
00:00:48,349 --> 00:00:48,299
made known unto

115
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:48,249
the children of

116
00:00:48,249 --> 00:00:48,199
men from the

117
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:48,149
foundation of the

118
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:48,099
world, and to do

119
00:00:48,099 --> 00:00:48,049
the will, both

120
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:47,999
of the Father

121
00:00:47,999 --> 00:00:47,949
and of the Son—of

122
00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:47,899
the Father

123
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:47,849
because of me, and of

124
00:00:47,849 --> 00:00:47,799
the Son because

125
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:47,749
of my flesh.

126
00:00:47,749 --> 00:00:47,699
And behold, the

127
00:00:47,699 --> 00:00:47,649
time is at hand,

128
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:47,599
and this night

129
00:00:47,599 --> 00:00:47,614
shall the sign be given.

130
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:47,79
15 And it came

131
00:00:47,79 --> 00:00:47,966
to pass that

132
00:00:47,966 --> 00:00:48,142
the words which

133
00:00:48,142 --> 00:00:48,318
came unto Nephi

134
00:00:48,318 --> 00:00:48,494
were fulfilled,

135
00:00:48,494 --> 00:00:48,67
according as

136
00:00:48,67 --> 00:00:48,846
they had been

137
00:00:48,846 --> 00:00:49,022
spoken; for

138
00:00:49,022 --> 00:00:49,198
behold, at the going

139
00:00:49,198 --> 00:00:49,374
down of the

140
00:00:49,374 --> 00:00:49,55
sun there was no

141
00:00:49,55 --> 00:00:49,726
darkness; and

142
00:00:49,726 --> 00:00:49,902
the people began

143
00:00:49,902 --> 00:00:50,078
to be

144
00:00:50,078 --> 00:00:50,254
astonished because

145
00:00:50,254 --> 00:00:50,43
there was no

146
00:00:50,43 --> 00:00:50,017
darkness when the night came.

147
00:00:50,017 --> 00:00:49,972
16 And there

148
00:00:49,972 --> 00:00:49,927
were many, who

149
00:00:49,927 --> 00:00:49,882
had not

150
00:00:49,882 --> 00:00:49,837
believed the words

151
00:00:49,837 --> 00:00:49,792
of the

152
00:00:49,792 --> 00:00:49,747
prophets, who fell to

153
00:00:49,747 --> 00:00:49,702
the earth and

154
00:00:49,702 --> 00:00:49,657
became as if

155
00:00:49,657 --> 00:00:49,612
they were dead,

156
00:00:49,612 --> 00:00:49,567
for they knew

157
00:00:49,567 --> 00:00:49,522
that the

158
00:00:49,522 --> 00:00:49,477
great plan of

159
00:00:49,477 --> 00:00:49,432
destruction which

160
00:00:49,432 --> 00:00:49,387
they had laid

161
00:00:49,387 --> 00:00:49,342
for those who

162
00:00:49,342 --> 00:00:49,297
believed in

163
00:00:49,297 --> 00:00:49,252
the words of the

164
00:00:49,252 --> 00:00:49,207
prophets had

165
00:00:49,207 --> 00:00:49,162
been

166
00:00:49,162 --> 00:00:49,117
frustrated; for the

167
00:00:49,117 --> 00:00:49,072
sign which had

168
00:00:49,072 --> 00:00:49,082
been given was already at hand.

169
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:49,029
17 And they

170
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:48,976
began to know

171
00:00:48,976 --> 00:00:48,923
that the Son

172
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:48,87
of God must

173
00:00:48,87 --> 00:00:48,817
shortly

174
00:00:48,817 --> 00:00:48,764
appear; yea, in

175
00:00:48,764 --> 00:00:48,711
fine, all the

176
00:00:48,711 --> 00:00:48,658
people upon the

177
00:00:48,658 --> 00:00:48,605
face of the

178
00:00:48,605 --> 00:00:48,552
whole earth

179
00:00:48,552 --> 00:00:48,499
from the west

180
00:00:48,499 --> 00:00:48,446
to the east,

181
00:00:48,446 --> 00:00:48,393
both in the

182
00:00:48,393 --> 00:00:48,34
land north and

183
00:00:48,34 --> 00:00:48,287
in the land

184
00:00:48,287 --> 00:00:48,234
south, were

185
00:00:48,234 --> 00:00:48,181
so exceedingly

186
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:48,128
astonished

187
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:48,148
that they fell to the earth.

188
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:48,266
18 For they

189
00:00:48,266 --> 00:00:48,384
knew that

190
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:48,502
the prophets

191
00:00:48,502 --> 00:00:48,62
had testified

192
00:00:48,62 --> 00:00:48,738
of these

193
00:00:48,738 --> 00:00:48,856
things for

194
00:00:48,856 --> 00:00:48,974
many years, and

195
00:00:48,974 --> 00:00:49,092
that the

196
