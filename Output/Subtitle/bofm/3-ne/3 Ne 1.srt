00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:04,846
Third NephiThe Book of Nephi the Son of Nephi, Who

2
00:00:04,846 --> 00:00:09,692
 Was the Son of HelamanAnd Helaman was the son of

3
00:00:09,692 --> 00:00:14,538
 Helaman, who was the son of Alma, who was the son

4
00:00:14,538 --> 00:00:19,384
 of Alma, being a descendant of Nephi who was the

5
00:00:19,384 --> 00:00:24,23
 son of Lehi, who came out of Jerusalem in the first

6
00:00:24,23 --> 00:00:29,076
 year of the reign of Zedekiah, the king of

7
00:00:29,076 --> 00:00:33,922
 Judah.Chapter 1 Nephi, the son of Helaman, departs out

8
00:00:33,922 --> 00:00:38,768
 of the land, and his son Nephi keeps the

9
00:00:38,768 --> 00:00:43,614
 records—Though signs and wonders abound, the wicked plan to

10
00:00:43,614 --> 00:00:48,46
 slay the righteous—The night of Christ’s birth

11
00:00:48,46 --> 00:00:53,306
 arrives—The sign is given, and a new star

12
00:00:53,306 --> 00:00:58,152
 arises—Lyings and deceivings increase, and the Gadianton

13
00:00:58,152 --> 00:01:02,998
 robbers slaughter many. About A.D. 1–4.

14
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:18,997
1 Now it came to pass that the ninety and first

15
00:01:18,997 --> 00:01:34,197
 year had passed away and it was six hundred years

16
00:01:34,197 --> 00:01:49,397
 from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem; and it was

17
00:01:49,397 --> 00:02:04,597
 in the year that Lachoneus was the chief judge and

18
00:02:04,597 --> 00:02:19,797
 the governor over the land

19
00:02:19,84 --> 00:02:27,34
2 And Nephi, the son of Helaman, had departed out

20
00:02:27,34 --> 00:02:34,84
 of the land of Zarahemla, giving charge unto his

21
00:02:34,84 --> 00:02:42,34
 son Nephi, who was his eldest son, concerning the

22
00:02:42,34 --> 00:02:49,84
 plates of brass, and all the records which had been

23
00:02:49,84 --> 00:02:57,34
 kept, and all those things which had been kept

24
00:02:57,34 --> 00:03:04,84
 sacred from the departure of Lehi out of Jerusalem

25
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:10,501
3 Then he departed out of the land, and whither he

26
00:03:10,501 --> 00:03:16,251
 went, no man knoweth; and his son Nephi did keep

27
00:03:16,251 --> 00:03:22,001
 the records in his stead, yea, the record of this

28
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:27,751
 people

29
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:34,474
4 And it came to pass that in the commencement of

30
00:03:34,474 --> 00:03:41,474
 the ninety and second year, behold, the prophecies

31
00:03:41,474 --> 00:03:48,474
 of the prophets began to be fulfilled more fully;

32
00:03:48,474 --> 00:03:55,474
 for there began to be greater signs and greater

33
00:03:55,474 --> 00:04:02,474
 miracles wrought among the people

34
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:07,408
5 But there were some who began to say that the

35
00:04:07,408 --> 00:04:12,741
 time was past for the words to be fulfilled, which

36
00:04:12,741 --> 00:04:18,074
 were spoken by Samuel, the Lamanite

37
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:40,725
6 And they began to rejoice over their brethren,

38
00:04:40,725 --> 00:05:02,725
 saying: Behold the time is past, and the words of

39
00:05:02,725 --> 00:05:24,725
 Samuel are not fulfilled; therefore, your joy and

40
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:46,725
 your faith concerning this thing hath been vain

41
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:49,646
7 And it came to pass that they did make a great

42
00:05:49,646 --> 00:05:52,846
 uproar throughout the land; and the people who

43
00:05:52,846 --> 00:05:56,046
 believed began to be very sorrowful, lest by any means

44
00:05:56,046 --> 00:05:59,246
 those things which had been spoken might not come

45
00:05:59,246 --> 00:06:02,446
 to pass

46
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:04,395
8 But behold, they did watch steadfastly for that

47
00:06:04,395 --> 00:06:06,395
 day and that night and that day which should be as

48
00:06:06,395 --> 00:06:08,395
 one day as if there were no night, that they

49
00:06:08,395 --> 00:06:10,395
 might know that their faith had not been vain

50
00:06:10,37 --> 00:06:10,37
9 Now it came to pass that there was a day set

51
00:06:10,37 --> 00:06:10,37
 apart by the unbelievers, that all those who believed

52
00:06:10,37 --> 00:06:10,37
 in those traditions should be put to death except

53
00:06:10,37 --> 00:06:10,37
 the sign should come to pass, which had been

54
00:06:10,37 --> 00:06:10,37
 given by Samuel the prophet

55
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:12,804
10 Now it came to pass that when Nephi, the son of

56
00:06:12,804 --> 00:06:14,804
 Nephi, saw this wickedness of his people, his

57
00:06:14,804 --> 00:06:16,804
 heart was exceedingly sorrowful

58
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:21,376
11 And it came to pass that he went out and bowed

59
00:06:21,376 --> 00:06:26,176
 himself down upon the earth, and cried mightily to

60
00:06:26,176 --> 00:06:30,976
 his God in behalf of his people, yea, those who

61
00:06:30,976 --> 00:06:35,776
 were about to be destroyed because of their faith

62
00:06:35,776 --> 00:06:40,576
 in the tradition of their fathers

63
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:46,234
12 And it came to pass that he cried mightily unto

64
00:06:46,234 --> 00:06:51,567
 the Lord all that day; and behold, the voice of

65
00:06:51,567 --> 00:06:56,9
 the Lord came unto him, saying

66
00:06:56,85 --> 00:07:03,35
13 Lift up your head and be of good cheer; for

67
00:07:03,35 --> 00:07:09,85
 behold, the time is at hand, and on this night shall

68
00:07:09,85 --> 00:07:16,35
 the sign be given, and on the morrow come I into

69
00:07:16,35 --> 00:07:22,85
 the world, to show unto the world that I will

70
00:07:22,85 --> 00:07:29,35
 fulfil all that which I have caused to be spoken by the

71
00:07:29,35 --> 00:07:35,85
 mouth of my holy prophets

72
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:42,184
14 Behold, I come unto my own, to fulfil all

73
00:07:42,184 --> 00:07:48,613
 things which I have made known unto the children of men

74
00:07:48,613 --> 00:07:55,042
 from the foundation of the world, and to do the

75
00:07:55,042 --> 00:08:01,471
 will, both of the Father and of the Son—of the

76
00:08:01,471 --> 00:08:07,9
 Father because of me, and of the Son because of my

77
00:08:07,9 --> 00:08:14,329
 flesh. And behold, the time is at hand, and this

78
00:08:14,329 --> 00:08:20,758
 night shall the sign be given

79
00:08:20,2 --> 00:08:25,7
15 And it came to pass that the words which came

80
00:08:25,7 --> 00:08:31,2
 unto Nephi were fulfilled, according as they had

81
00:08:31,2 --> 00:08:36,7
 been spoken; for behold, at the going down of the

82
00:08:36,7 --> 00:08:42,2
 sun there was no darkness; and the people began to

83
00:08:42,2 --> 00:08:47,7
 be astonished because there was no darkness when

84
00:08:47,7 --> 00:08:53,2
 the night came

85
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:58,023
16 And there were many, who had not believed the

86
00:08:58,023 --> 00:09:02,88
 words of the prophets, who fell to the earth and

87
00:09:02,88 --> 00:09:07,737
 became as if they were dead, for they knew that the

88
00:09:07,737 --> 00:09:12,594
 great plan of destruction which they had laid for

89
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:17,451
 those who believed in the words of the prophets

90
00:09:17,451 --> 00:09:22,308
 had been frustrated; for the sign which had been

91
00:09:22,308 --> 00:09:27,165
 given was already at hand

92
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:34,0
17 And they began to know that the Son of God must

93
00:09:34,0 --> 00:09:40,333
 shortly appear; yea, in fine, all the people upon

94
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:46,666
 the face of the whole earth from the west to the

95
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:52,999
 east, both in the land north and in the land

96
00:09:52,999 --> 00:09:59,332
 south, were so exceedingly astonished that they fell to

97
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:05,665
 the earth

98
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:10,372
18 For they knew that the prophets had testified

99
00:10:10,372 --> 00:10:15,172
 of these things for many years, and that the sign

100
00:10:15,172 --> 00:10:19,972
 which had been given was already at hand; and they

101
00:10:19,972 --> 00:10:24,772
 began to fear because of their iniquity and their

102
00:10:24,772 --> 00:10:29,572
 unbelief

103
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:34,467
19 And it came to pass that there was no darkness

104
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:39,038
 in all that night, but it was as light as though

105
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:43,609
 it was mid-day. And it came to pass that the sun

106
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:48,18
 did rise in the morning again, according to its

107
00:10:48,18 --> 00:10:52,751
 proper order; and they knew that it was the day that

108
00:10:52,751 --> 00:10:57,322
 the Lord should be born, because of the sign which

109
00:10:57,322 --> 00:11:01,893
 had been given

110
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:08,461
20 And it had come to pass, yea, all things, every

111
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:14,961
 whit, according to the words of the prophets

112
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:18,274
21 And it came to pass also that a new star did

113
00:11:18,274 --> 00:11:22,274
 appear, according to the word

114
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:27,568
22 And it came to pass that from this time forth

115
00:11:27,568 --> 00:11:32,854
 there began to be lyings sent forth among the

116
00:11:32,854 --> 00:11:38,14
 people, by Satan, to harden their hearts, to the intent

117
00:11:38,14 --> 00:11:43,426
 that they might not believe in those signs and

118
00:11:43,426 --> 00:11:48,712
 wonders which they had seen; but notwithstanding

119
00:11:48,712 --> 00:11:53,998
 these lyings and deceivings the more part of the

120
00:11:53,998 --> 00:11:59,284
 people did believe, and were converted unto the Lord

121
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:04,252
23 And it came to pass that Nephi went forth among

122
00:12:04,252 --> 00:12:09,252
 the people, and also many others, baptizing unto

123
00:12:09,252 --> 00:12:14,252
 repentance, in the which there was a great

124
00:12:14,252 --> 00:12:19,252
 remission of sins. And thus the people began again to

125
00:12:19,252 --> 00:12:24,252
 have peace in the land

126
00:12:24,51 --> 00:12:30,71
24 And there were no contentions, save it were a

127
00:12:30,71 --> 00:12:36,91
 few that began to preach, endeavoring to prove by

128
00:12:36,91 --> 00:12:43,11
 the scriptures that it was no more expedient to

129
00:12:43,11 --> 00:12:49,31
 observe the law of Moses. Now in this thing they did

130
00:12:49,31 --> 00:12:55,51
 err, having not understood the scriptures

131
00:12:55,008 --> 00:13:01,008
25 But it came to pass that they soon became

132
00:13:01,008 --> 00:13:07,008
 converted, and were convinced of the error which they

133
00:13:07,008 --> 00:13:13,008
 were in, for it was made known unto them that the

134
00:13:13,008 --> 00:13:19,008
 law was not yet fulfilled, and that it must be

135
00:13:19,008 --> 00:13:25,008
 fulfilled in every whit; yea, the word came unto them

136
00:13:25,008 --> 00:13:31,008
 that it must be fulfilled; yea, that one jot or

137
00:13:31,008 --> 00:13:37,008
 tittle should not pass away till it should all be

138
00:13:37,008 --> 00:13:43,008
 fulfilled; therefore in this same year were they

139
00:13:43,008 --> 00:13:49,008
 brought to a knowledge of their error and did confess

140
00:13:49,008 --> 00:13:55,008
 their faults

141
00:13:55,635 --> 00:14:00,235
26 And thus the ninety and second year did pass

142
00:14:00,235 --> 00:14:04,835
 away, bringing glad tidings unto the people because

143
00:14:04,835 --> 00:14:09,435
 of the signs which did come to pass, according to

144
00:14:09,435 --> 00:14:14,035
 the words of the prophecy of all the holy

145
00:14:14,035 --> 00:14:18,635
 prophets

146
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:24,124
27 And it came to pass that the ninety and third

147
00:14:24,124 --> 00:14:30,124
 year did also pass away in peace, save it were for

148
00:14:30,124 --> 00:14:36,124
 the Gadianton robbers, who dwelt upon the

149
00:14:36,124 --> 00:14:42,124
 mountains, who did infest the land; for so strong were

150
00:14:42,124 --> 00:14:48,124
 their holds and their secret places that the people

151
00:14:48,124 --> 00:14:54,124
 could not overpower them; therefore they did commit

152
00:14:54,124 --> 00:15:00,124
 many murders, and did do much slaughter among the

153
00:15:00,124 --> 00:15:06,124
 people

154
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:10,672
28 And it came to pass that in the ninety and

155
00:15:10,672 --> 00:15:15,005
 fourth year they began to increase in a great degree,

156
00:15:15,005 --> 00:15:19,338
 because there were many dissenters of the Nephites

157
00:15:19,338 --> 00:15:23,671
 who did flee unto them, which did cause much

158
00:15:23,671 --> 00:15:28,004
 sorrow unto those Nephites who did remain in the land

159
00:15:28,004 --> 00:15:32,337


160
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:38,689
29 And there was also a cause of much sorrow among

161
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:44,546
 the Lamanites; for behold, they had many children

162
00:15:44,546 --> 00:15:50,403
 who did grow up and began to wax strong in years,

163
00:15:50,403 --> 00:15:56,26
 that they became for themselves, and were led

164
00:15:56,26 --> 00:16:02,117
 away by some who were Zoramites, by their lyings and

165
00:16:02,117 --> 00:16:07,974
 their flattering words, to join those Gadianton

166
00:16:07,974 --> 00:16:13,831
 robbers

167
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:19,523
30 And thus were the Lamanites afflicted also, and

168
00:16:19,523 --> 00:16:25,273
 began to decrease as to their faith and

169
00:16:25,273 --> 00:16:31,023
 righteousness, because of the wickedness of the rising

170
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:36,773
 generation.
