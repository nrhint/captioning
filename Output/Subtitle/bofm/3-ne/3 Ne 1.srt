00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Third NephiThe Book of Nephi the Son of Nephi,

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Who Was the Son of HelamanAnd Helaman was the son

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of Helaman, who was the son of Alma, who was

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the son of Alma, being a descendant of Nephi who

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
was the son of Lehi, who came out of Jerusalem in

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the first year of the reign of Zedekiah, the

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
king of Judah.Chapter 1 Nephi, the son of Helaman,

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
departs out of the land, and his son Nephi

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
keeps the records—Though signs and wonders abound,

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the wicked plan to slay the righteous—The night

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of Christ’s birth arrives—The sign is given, and

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
a new star arises—Lyings and deceivings

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:04:43,
increase, and the Gadianton robbers slaughter many. About A.D. 1–4. 

14
00:04:43,0 --> 00:04:43,0
1 Now it came to pass that the ninety and

15
00:04:43,0 --> 00:04:43,0
first year had passed away and it was six

16
00:04:43,0 --> 00:04:43,0
hundred years from the time that Lehi left

17
00:04:43,0 --> 00:04:43,0
Jerusalem; and it was in the year that Lachoneus was

18
00:04:43,0 --> 00:04:15,
the chief judge and the governor over the land.

19
00:04:15,0 --> 00:04:15,0
2 And Nephi, the son of Helaman, had

20
00:04:15,0 --> 00:04:15,0
departed out of the land of Zarahemla, giving

21
00:04:15,0 --> 00:04:15,0
charge unto his son Nephi, who was his

22
00:04:15,0 --> 00:04:15,0
eldest son, concerning the plates of brass,

23
00:04:15,0 --> 00:04:15,0
and all the records which had been kept, and

24
00:04:15,0 --> 00:04:15,0
all those things which had been kept

25
00:04:15,0 --> 00:05:59,
sacred from the departure of Lehi out of Jerusalem.

26
00:05:59,0 --> 00:05:59,0
3 Then he departed out of the land, and

27
00:05:59,0 --> 00:05:59,0
whither he went, no man knoweth; and

28
00:05:59,0 --> 00:05:59,0
his son Nephi did keep the records in

29
00:05:59,0 --> 00:05:31,
his stead, yea, the record of this people.

30
00:05:31,0 --> 00:05:31,0
4 And it came to pass that in the

31
00:05:31,0 --> 00:05:31,0
commencement of the ninety and second

32
00:05:31,0 --> 00:05:31,0
year, behold, the prophecies of the

33
00:05:31,0 --> 00:05:31,0
prophets began to be fulfilled more fully;

34
00:05:31,0 --> 00:05:31,0
for there began to be greater signs and

35
00:05:31,0 --> 00:07:43,
greater miracles wrought among the people.

36
00:07:43,0 --> 00:07:43,0
5 But there were some who began

37
00:07:43,0 --> 00:07:43,0
to say that the time was past for

38
00:07:43,0 --> 00:07:43,0
the words to be fulfilled, which

39
00:07:43,0 --> 00:07:15,
were spoken by Samuel, the Lamanite.

40
00:07:15,0 --> 00:07:15,0
6 And they began to rejoice over

41
00:07:15,0 --> 00:07:15,0
their brethren, saying: Behold

42
00:07:15,0 --> 00:07:15,0
the time is past, and the words

43
00:07:15,0 --> 00:07:15,0
of Samuel are not fulfilled;

44
00:07:15,0 --> 00:07:15,0
therefore, your joy and your faith

45
00:07:15,0 --> 00:10:45,
concerning this thing hath been vain.

46
00:10:45,0 --> 00:10:45,0
7 And it came to pass that

47
00:10:45,0 --> 00:10:45,0
they did make a great uproar

48
00:10:45,0 --> 00:10:45,0
throughout the land; and the

49
00:10:45,0 --> 00:10:45,0
people who believed began to be

50
00:10:45,0 --> 00:10:45,0
very sorrowful, lest by any

51
00:10:45,0 --> 00:10:45,0
means those things which had

52
00:10:45,0 --> 00:10:17,
been spoken might not come to pass.

53
00:10:17,0 --> 00:10:17,0
8 But behold, they did

54
00:10:17,0 --> 00:10:17,0
watch steadfastly for that day

55
00:10:17,0 --> 00:10:17,0
and that night and that day

56
00:10:17,0 --> 00:10:17,0
which should be as one day

57
00:10:17,0 --> 00:10:17,0
as if there were no night,

58
00:10:17,0 --> 00:10:17,0
that they might know that

59
00:10:17,0 --> 00:11:47,
their faith had not been vain.

60
00:11:47,0 --> 00:11:47,0
9 Now it came to pass

61
00:11:47,0 --> 00:11:47,0
that there was a day set

62
00:11:47,0 --> 00:11:47,0
apart by the unbelievers,

63
00:11:47,0 --> 00:11:47,0
that all those who

64
00:11:47,0 --> 00:11:47,0
believed in those traditions

65
00:11:47,0 --> 00:11:47,0
should be put to death

66
00:11:47,0 --> 00:11:47,0
except the sign should

67
00:11:47,0 --> 00:11:47,0
come to pass, which had

68
00:11:47,0 --> 00:11:19,
been given by Samuel the prophet.

69
00:11:19,0 --> 00:11:19,0
10 Now it came to

70
00:11:19,0 --> 00:11:19,0
pass that when Nephi,

71
00:11:19,0 --> 00:11:19,0
the son of Nephi, saw

72
00:11:19,0 --> 00:11:19,0
this wickedness of his

73
00:11:19,0 --> 00:11:19,0
people, his heart

74
00:11:19,0 --> 00:12:17,
was exceedingly sorrowful.

75
00:12:17,0 --> 00:12:17,0
11 And it came to

76
00:12:17,0 --> 00:12:17,0
pass that he went

77
00:12:17,0 --> 00:12:17,0
out and bowed himself

78
00:12:17,0 --> 00:12:17,0
down upon the

79
00:12:17,0 --> 00:12:17,0
earth, and cried

80
00:12:17,0 --> 00:12:17,0
mightily to his God in

81
00:12:17,0 --> 00:12:17,0
behalf of his people,

82
00:12:17,0 --> 00:12:17,0
yea, those who

83
00:12:17,0 --> 00:12:17,0
were about to be

84
00:12:17,0 --> 00:12:17,0
destroyed because of

85
00:12:17,0 --> 00:12:17,0
their faith in the

86
00:12:17,0 --> 00:19:47,
tradition of their fathers.

87
00:19:47,0 --> 00:19:47,0
12 And it came to

88
00:19:47,0 --> 00:19:47,0
pass that he cried

89
00:19:47,0 --> 00:19:47,0
mightily unto the

90
00:19:47,0 --> 00:19:47,0
Lord all that

91
00:19:47,0 --> 00:19:47,0
day; and behold, the

92
00:19:47,0 --> 00:19:47,0
voice of the Lord

93
00:19:47,0 --> 00:19:19,
came unto him, saying:

94
00:19:19,0 --> 00:19:19,0
13 Lift up your

95
00:19:19,0 --> 00:19:19,0
head and be of

96
00:19:19,0 --> 00:19:19,0
good cheer; for

97
00:19:19,0 --> 00:19:19,0
behold, the time is

98
00:19:19,0 --> 00:19:19,0
at hand, and on

99
00:19:19,0 --> 00:19:19,0
this night shall

100
00:19:19,0 --> 00:19:19,0
the sign be given,

101
00:19:19,0 --> 00:19:19,0
and on the morrow

102
00:19:19,0 --> 00:19:19,0
come I into the

103
00:19:19,0 --> 00:19:19,0
world, to show

104
00:19:19,0 --> 00:19:19,0
unto the world that

105
00:19:19,0 --> 00:19:19,0
I will fulfil

106
00:19:19,0 --> 00:19:19,0
all that which I

107
00:19:19,0 --> 00:19:19,0
have caused to be

108
00:19:19,0 --> 00:19:19,0
spoken by the

109
00:19:19,0 --> 00:22:49,
mouth of my holy prophets.

110
00:22:49,0 --> 00:22:49,0
14 Behold, I

111
00:22:49,0 --> 00:22:49,0
come unto my own,

112
00:22:49,0 --> 00:22:49,0
to fulfil all

113
00:22:49,0 --> 00:22:49,0
things which I have

114
00:22:49,0 --> 00:22:49,0
made known unto

115
00:22:49,0 --> 00:22:49,0
the children of

116
00:22:49,0 --> 00:22:49,0
men from the

117
00:22:49,0 --> 00:22:49,0
foundation of the

118
00:22:49,0 --> 00:22:49,0
world, and to do

119
00:22:49,0 --> 00:22:49,0
the will, both

120
00:22:49,0 --> 00:22:49,0
of the Father

121
00:22:49,0 --> 00:22:49,0
and of the Son—of

122
00:22:49,0 --> 00:22:49,0
the Father

123
00:22:49,0 --> 00:22:49,0
because of me, and of

124
00:22:49,0 --> 00:22:49,0
the Son because

125
00:22:49,0 --> 00:22:49,0
of my flesh.

126
00:22:49,0 --> 00:22:49,0
And behold, the

127
00:22:49,0 --> 00:22:49,0
time is at hand,

128
00:22:49,0 --> 00:22:49,0
and this night

129
00:22:49,0 --> 00:23:19,
shall the sign be given.

130
00:23:19,0 --> 00:23:19,0
15 And it came

131
00:23:19,0 --> 00:23:19,0
to pass that

132
00:23:19,0 --> 00:23:19,0
the words which

133
00:23:19,0 --> 00:23:19,0
came unto Nephi

134
00:23:19,0 --> 00:23:19,0
were fulfilled,

135
00:23:19,0 --> 00:23:19,0
according as

136
00:23:19,0 --> 00:23:19,0
they had been

137
00:23:19,0 --> 00:23:19,0
spoken; for

138
00:23:19,0 --> 00:23:19,0
behold, at the going

139
00:23:19,0 --> 00:23:19,0
down of the

140
00:23:19,0 --> 00:23:19,0
sun there was no

141
00:23:19,0 --> 00:23:19,0
darkness; and

142
00:23:19,0 --> 00:23:19,0
the people began

143
00:23:19,0 --> 00:23:19,0
to be

144
00:23:19,0 --> 00:23:19,0
astonished because

145
00:23:19,0 --> 00:23:19,0
there was no

146
00:23:19,0 --> 00:28:29,
darkness when the night came.

147
00:28:29,0 --> 00:28:29,0
16 And there

148
00:28:29,0 --> 00:28:29,0
were many, who

149
00:28:29,0 --> 00:28:29,0
had not

150
00:28:29,0 --> 00:28:29,0
believed the words

151
00:28:29,0 --> 00:28:29,0
of the

152
00:28:29,0 --> 00:28:29,0
prophets, who fell to

153
00:28:29,0 --> 00:28:29,0
the earth and

154
00:28:29,0 --> 00:28:29,0
became as if

155
00:28:29,0 --> 00:28:29,0
they were dead,

156
00:28:29,0 --> 00:28:29,0
for they knew

157
00:28:29,0 --> 00:28:29,0
that the

158
00:28:29,0 --> 00:28:29,0
great plan of

159
00:28:29,0 --> 00:28:29,0
destruction which

160
00:28:29,0 --> 00:28:29,0
they had laid

161
00:28:29,0 --> 00:28:29,0
for those who

162
00:28:29,0 --> 00:28:29,0
believed in

163
00:28:29,0 --> 00:28:29,0
the words of the

164
00:28:29,0 --> 00:28:29,0
prophets had

165
00:28:29,0 --> 00:28:29,0
been

166
00:28:29,0 --> 00:28:29,0
frustrated; for the

167
00:28:29,0 --> 00:28:29,0
sign which had

168
00:28:29,0 --> 00:34:39,
been given was already at hand.

169
00:34:39,0 --> 00:34:39,0
17 And they

170
00:34:39,0 --> 00:34:39,0
began to know

171
00:34:39,0 --> 00:34:39,0
that the Son

172
00:34:39,0 --> 00:34:39,0
of God must

173
00:34:39,0 --> 00:34:39,0
shortly

174
00:34:39,0 --> 00:34:39,0
appear; yea, in

175
00:34:39,0 --> 00:34:39,0
fine, all the

176
00:34:39,0 --> 00:34:39,0
people upon the

177
00:34:39,0 --> 00:34:39,0
face of the

178
00:34:39,0 --> 00:34:39,0
whole earth

179
00:34:39,0 --> 00:34:39,0
from the west

180
00:34:39,0 --> 00:34:39,0
to the east,

181
00:34:39,0 --> 00:34:39,0
both in the

182
00:34:39,0 --> 00:34:39,0
land north and

183
00:34:39,0 --> 00:34:39,0
in the land

184
00:34:39,0 --> 00:34:39,0
south, were

185
00:34:39,0 --> 00:34:39,0
so exceedingly

186
00:34:39,0 --> 00:34:39,0
astonished

187
00:34:39,0 --> 00:46:35,
that they fell to the earth.

188
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
18 For they

189
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
knew that

190
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
the prophets

191
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
had testified

192
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
of these

193
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
things for

194
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
many years, and

195
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
that the

196
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
sign which had

197
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
been given

198
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
was already

199
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
at hand; and

200
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
they began

201
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
to fear

202
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
because of their

203
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
iniquity

204
00:46:35,0 --> 00:52:46,
and their unbelief.

205
00:52:46,0 --> 00:52:46,0
19 And it

206
00:52:46,0 --> 00:52:46,0
came to pass

207
00:52:46,0 --> 00:52:46,0
that there

208
00:52:46,0 --> 00:52:46,0
was no

209
00:52:46,0 --> 00:52:46,0
darkness in

210
00:52:46,0 --> 00:52:46,0
all that

211
00:52:46,0 --> 00:52:46,0
night, but it

212
00:52:46,0 --> 00:52:46,0
was as light

213
00:52:46,0 --> 00:52:46,0
as though

214
00:52:46,0 --> 00:52:46,0
it was

215
00:52:46,0 --> 00:52:46,0
mid-day. And it

216
00:52:46,0 --> 00:52:46,0
came to

217
00:52:46,0 --> 00:52:46,0
