1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 12 Jesus calls and commissions the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
twelve disciples—He delivers to the Nephites a

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
discourse similar to the Sermon on the Mount—He

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
speaks the Beatitudes—His teachings transcend and

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
take precedence over the law of Moses—Men are

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
commanded to be perfect even as He and His

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:06:41,
Father are perfect—Compare 
Matthew 5. About A.D. 34. 

8
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
1 And it came to pass that when Jesus had

9
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
spoken these words unto Nephi, and to those who

10
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
had been called, (now the number of them who had

11
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
been called, and received power and authority

12
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
to baptize, was twelve) and behold, he

13
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
stretched forth his hand unto the multitude, and

14
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
cried unto them, saying: Blessed are ye if ye

15
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
shall give heed unto the words of these twelve

16
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
whom I have chosen from among you to minister

17
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
unto you, and to be your servants; and unto them

18
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
I have given power that they may baptize you

19
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
with water; and after that ye are baptized

20
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
with water, behold, I will baptize you with fire

21
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
and with the Holy Ghost; therefore blessed are

22
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
ye if ye shall believe in me and be baptized,

23
00:06:41,0 --> 00:10:54,
after that ye have seen me and know that I am.

24
00:10:54,0 --> 00:10:54,0
2 And again, more blessed are they who shall

25
00:10:54,0 --> 00:10:54,0
believe in your words because that ye shall

26
00:10:54,0 --> 00:10:54,0
testify that ye have seen me, and that ye know

27
00:10:54,0 --> 00:10:54,0
that I am. Yea, blessed are they who shall

28
00:10:54,0 --> 00:10:54,0
believe in your words, and come down into the

29
00:10:54,0 --> 00:10:54,0
depths of humility and be baptized, for they

30
00:10:54,0 --> 00:10:54,0
shall be visited with fire and with the Holy

31
00:10:54,0 --> 00:10:40,
Ghost, and shall receive a remission of their sins.

32
00:10:40,0 --> 00:10:40,0
3 Yea, blessed are the poor in

33
00:10:40,0 --> 00:10:40,0
spirit who come unto me, for

34
00:10:40,0 --> 00:12:52,
theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

35
00:12:52,0 --> 00:12:52,0
4 And again, blessed are

36
00:12:52,0 --> 00:12:52,0
all they that mourn,

37
00:12:52,0 --> 00:15:48,
for they shall be comforted.

38
00:15:48,0 --> 00:15:48,0
5 And blessed are

39
00:15:48,0 --> 00:15:48,0
the meek, for they

40
00:15:48,0 --> 00:26:56,
shall inherit the earth.

41
00:26:56,0 --> 00:26:56,0
6 And blessed are

42
00:26:56,0 --> 00:26:56,0
all they who do

43
00:26:56,0 --> 00:26:56,0
hunger and thirst after

44
00:26:56,0 --> 00:26:56,0
righteousness, for

45
00:26:56,0 --> 00:26:56,0
they shall be

46
00:26:56,0 --> 00:29:08,
filled with the Holy Ghost.

47
00:29:08,0 --> 00:29:08,0
7 And blessed

48
00:29:08,0 --> 00:29:08,0
are the

49
00:29:08,0 --> 00:29:08,0
merciful, for they

50
00:29:08,0 --> 00:31:50,
shall obtain mercy.

51
00:31:50,0 --> 00:31:50,0
8 And

52
00:31:50,0 --> 00:31:50,0
blessed are all

53
00:31:50,0 --> 00:31:50,0
the pure in

54
00:31:50,0 --> 00:31:50,0
heart, for

55
00:31:50,0 --> 00:39:47,
they shall see God.

56
00:39:47,0 --> 00:39:47,0
9 And

57
00:39:47,0 --> 00:39:47,0
blessed are all

58
00:39:47,0 --> 00:39:47,0
the

59
00:39:47,0 --> 00:39:47,0
peacemakers, for they

60
00:39:47,0 --> 00:39:47,0
shall be

61
00:39:47,0 --> 00:39:47,0
called the

62
00:39:47,0 --> 00:44:57,
children of God.

63
00:44:57,0 --> 00:44:57,0
10 And

64
00:44:57,0 --> 00:44:57,0
blessed are all

65
00:44:57,0 --> 00:44:57,0
they who

66
00:44:57,0 --> 00:44:57,0
are

67
00:44:57,0 --> 00:44:57,0
persecuted for my

68
00:44:57,0 --> 00:44:57,0
name’s sake,

69
00:44:57,0 --> 00:44:57,0
for theirs

70
00:44:57,0 --> 00:44:57,0
is the

71
00:44:57,0 --> 00:46:09,
kingdom of heaven.

72
00:46:09,0 --> 00:46:09,0
11 And

73
00:46:09,0 --> 00:46:09,0
blessed are

74
00:46:09,0 --> 00:46:09,0
ye when men

75
00:46:09,0 --> 00:46:09,0
shall

76
00:46:09,0 --> 00:46:09,0
revile you

77
00:46:09,0 --> 00:46:09,0
and

78
00:46:09,0 --> 00:46:09,0
persecute, and

79
00:46:09,0 --> 00:46:09,0
shall say all

80
00:46:09,0 --> 00:46:09,0
manner of

81
00:46:09,0 --> 00:46:09,0
evil

82
00:46:09,0 --> 00:46:09,0
against you

83
00:46:09,0 --> 00:45:41,
falsely, for my sake;

84
00:45:41,0 --> 00:45:41,0
12 For ye

85
00:45:41,0 --> 00:45:41,0
shall

86
00:45:41,0 --> 00:45:41,0
have great

87
00:45:41,0 --> 00:45:41,0
joy and

88
00:45:41,0 --> 00:45:41,0
be

89
00:45:41,0 --> 00:45:41,0
exceedingly

90
00:45:41,0 --> 00:45:41,0
glad, for

91
00:45:41,0 --> 00:45:41,0
great shall

92
00:45:41,0 --> 00:45:41,0
be your

93
00:45:41,0 --> 00:45:41,0
reward in

94
00:45:41,0 --> 00:45:41,0
heaven;

95
00:45:41,0 --> 00:45:41,0
for so

96
00:45:41,0 --> 00:45:41,0
persecuted

97
00:45:41,0 --> 00:45:41,0
they the

98
00:45:41,0 --> 00:45:41,0
prophets

99
00:45:41,0 --> 00:45:13,
who were before you.

100
00:45:13,0 --> 00:45:13,0
13

101
00:45:13,0 --> 00:45:13,0
Verily,

102
00:45:13,0 --> 00:45:13,0
verily, I say

103
00:45:13,0 --> 00:45:13,0
unto

104
00:45:13,0 --> 00:45:13,0
you, I

105
00:45:13,0 --> 00:45:13,0
give unto

106
00:45:13,0 --> 00:45:13,0
you to be

107
00:45:13,0 --> 00:45:13,0
the

108
00:45:13,0 --> 00:45:13,0
salt of the

109
00:45:13,0 --> 00:45:13,0
earth;

110
00:45:13,0 --> 00:45:13,0
but if

111
00:45:13,0 --> 00:45:13,0
the salt

112
00:45:13,0 --> 00:45:13,0
shall

113
00:45:13,0 --> 00:45:13,0
lose its

114
00:45:13,0 --> 00:45:13,0
savor

115
00:45:13,0 --> 00:45:13,0
wherewith

116
00:45:13,0 --> 00:45:13,0
shall the

117
00:45:13,0 --> 00:45:13,0
earth

118
00:45:13,0 --> 00:45:13,0
be

119
00:45:13,0 --> 00:45:13,0
salted? The

120
00:45:13,0 --> 00:45:13,0
salt shall

121
00:45:13,0 --> 00:45:13,0
be

122
00:45:13,0 --> 00:45:13,0
thenceforth

123
00:45:13,0 --> 00:45:13,0
good for

124
00:45:13,0 --> 00:45:13,0


125
00:45:13,0 --> 00:45:13,0
nothing, but to

126
00:45:13,0 --> 00:45:13,0
be cast

127
00:45:13,0 --> 00:45:13,0
out and

128
00:45:13,0 --> 00:46:25,
to be trodden under foot of men.

129
00:46:25,0 --> 00:46:25,0
14

130
00:46:25,0 --> 00:46:25,0
Verily,

131
00:46:25,0 --> 00:46:25,0
verily, I

132
00:46:25,0 --> 00:46:25,0
say

133
00:46:25,0 --> 00:46:25,0
unto you,

134
00:46:25,0 --> 00:46:25,0
I give

135
00:46:25,0 --> 00:46:25,0
unto

136
00:46:25,0 --> 00:46:25,0
you to be

137
00:46:25,0 --> 00:46:25,0
the

138
00:46:25,0 --> 00:46:25,0
light of

139
00:46:25,0 --> 00:46:25,0
this

140
00:46:25,0 --> 00:46:25,0
people. A

141

142
00:46:25,0 --> 00:46:25,0
that is

143
00:46:25,0 --> 00:46:25,0
set on

144
00:46:25,0 --> 00:51:54,
a hill cannot be hid.

145
00:51:54,0 --> 00:51:54,0
15

146
00:51:54,0 --> 00:51:54,0
Behold,

00:51:54,0 --> 00:51:54,0

152
00:51:54,0 --> 00:51:54,0

153
00:51:54,0 --> 00:51:54,0
under a

154
00:51:54,0 --> 00:51:54,0
bushel?

155
00:51:54,0 --> 00:51:54,0
Nay,

156
00:51:54,0 --> 00:51:54,0
but on

157
00:51:54,0 --> 00:51:54,0

01:00:06,0 --> 01:00:06,0
16

166
01:00:06,0 --> 01:00:06,0
Therefore

167
01:00:06,0 --> 01:00:06,0
let

168
01:00:06,0 --> 01:00:06,0

01:00:06,0 --> 01:00:06,0
Father

184
01:00:06,0 --> 01:00:06,0
who

185
01:00:06,0 --> 01:00:06,0

198
01:02:18,0 --> 01:02:18,0


199
01:02:18,0 --> 01:02:18,0
prophets. I

200
01:02:18,0 --> 01:02:18,0
am

201
01:02:18,0 --> 01:02:18,0

01:58:58,0 --> 01:58:58,0


2978
01:58:58,0 --> 01:58:58,0


2979
01:58:58,0 --> 01:58:58,0
evil

2980
01:58:58,0 --> 01:58:58,0


2981
01:58:58,0 --> 01:58:58,0


2982
01:58:58,0 --> 01:58:58,0


2983
01:58:58,0 --> 01:58:58,0
and

2984
01:58:58,0 --> 01:58:58,0


2985
01:58:58,0 --> 01:58:58,0


2986
01:58:58,0 --> 01:58:58,0
on

2987
01:58:58,0 --> 01:58:58,0


2988
01:58:58,0 --> 01:58:58,0


2989
01:58:58,0 --> 01:58:58,0


2990
01:58:58,0 --> 01:58:58,0
the

2991
01:58:58,0 --> 01:58:58,0

01:58:58,0 --> 01:58:58,0


2996
01:58:58,0 --> 01:58:44,
good.

2997
01:58:44,0 --> 01:58:44,0
46 Therefore those things which were of old time, which were under the law, in me are all

2998
01:58:44,0 --> 01:58:44,0


2999
01:58:44,0 --> 01:58:44,0
