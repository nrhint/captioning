1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:02,143
Chapter 12 Jesus calls and commissions the twelve

2
00:00:02,143 --> 00:00:04,286
 disciples—He delivers to the Nephites a discourse

3
00:00:04,286 --> 00:00:06,429
 similar to the Sermon on the Mount—He speaks the

4
00:00:06,429 --> 00:00:08,572
 Beatitudes—His teachings transcend and take

5
00:00:08,572 --> 00:00:10,715
 precedence over the law of Moses—Men are commanded to be

6
00:00:10,715 --> 00:00:12,858
 perfect even as He and His Father are

7
00:00:12,858 --> 00:00:15,001
 perfect—Compare 
Matthew 5. About A.D. 34.

8
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:16,482
1 And it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken

9
00:00:16,482 --> 00:00:17,015
 these words unto Nephi, and to those who had been

10
00:00:17,015 --> 00:00:17,548
 called, (now the number of them who had been

11
00:00:17,548 --> 00:00:18,081
 called, and received power and authority to baptize, was

12
00:00:18,081 --> 00:00:18,614
 twelve) and behold, he stretched forth his hand

13
00:00:18,614 --> 00:00:19,147
 unto the multitude, and cried unto them, saying:

14
00:00:19,147 --> 00:00:19,68
 Blessed are ye if ye shall give heed unto the words

15
00:00:19,68 --> 00:00:20,213
 of these twelve whom I have chosen from among you

16
00:00:20,213 --> 00:00:20,746
 to minister unto you, and to be your servants; and

17
00:00:20,746 --> 00:00:21,279
 unto them I have given power that they may

18
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:21,812
 baptize you with water; and after that ye are baptized

19
00:00:21,812 --> 00:00:22,345
 with water, behold, I will baptize you with fire

20
00:00:22,345 --> 00:00:22,878
 and with the Holy Ghost; therefore blessed are ye if

21
00:00:22,878 --> 00:00:23,411
 ye shall believe in me and be baptized, after

22
00:00:23,411 --> 00:00:23,944
 that ye have seen me and know that I am

23
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:24,924
2 And again, more blessed are they who shall

24
00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:25,924
 believe in your words because that ye shall testify

25
00:00:25,924 --> 00:00:26,924
 that ye have seen me, and that ye know that I am.

26
00:00:26,924 --> 00:00:27,924
 Yea, blessed are they who shall believe in your

27
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:28,924
 words, and come down into the depths of humility and be

28
00:00:28,924 --> 00:00:29,924
 baptized, for they shall be visited with fire and

29
00:00:29,924 --> 00:00:30,924
 with the Holy Ghost, and shall receive a

30
00:00:30,924 --> 00:00:31,924
 remission of their sins

31
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:35,899
3 Yea, blessed are the poor in spirit who come

32
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:39,899
 unto me, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven

33
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:43,873
4 And again, blessed are all they that mourn, for

34
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:47,873
 they shall be comforted

35
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:51,848
5 And blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit

36
00:00:51,848 --> 00:00:55,848
 the earth

37
00:00:55,822 --> 00:01:01,155
6 And blessed are all they who do hunger and

38
00:01:01,155 --> 00:01:06,488
 thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled

39
00:01:06,488 --> 00:01:11,821
 with the Holy Ghost

40
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:19,772
7 And blessed are the merciful, for they shall

41
00:01:19,772 --> 00:01:27,772
 obtain mercy

42
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:31,721
8 And blessed are all the pure in heart, for they

43
00:01:31,721 --> 00:01:35,721
 shall see God

44
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:39,696
9 And blessed are all the peacemakers, for they

45
00:01:39,696 --> 00:01:43,696
 shall be called the children of God

46
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:49,003
10 And blessed are all they who are persecuted for

47
00:01:49,003 --> 00:01:54,336
 my name’s sake, for theirs is the kingdom of

48
00:01:54,336 --> 00:01:59,669
 heaven

49
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:02,287
11 And blessed are ye when men shall revile you

50
00:02:02,287 --> 00:02:04,954
 and persecute, and shall say all manner of evil

51
00:02:04,954 --> 00:02:07,621
 against you falsely, for my sake

52
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,594
12 For ye shall have great joy and be exceedingly

53
00:02:09,594 --> 00:02:11,594
 glad, for great shall be your reward in heaven;

54
00:02:11,594 --> 00:02:13,594
 for so persecuted they the prophets who were before

55
00:02:13,594 --> 00:02:15,594
 you

56
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:16,902
13 Verily, verily, I say unto you, I give unto you

57
00:02:16,902 --> 00:02:18,235
 to be the salt of the earth; but if the salt

58
00:02:18,235 --> 00:02:19,568
 shall lose its savor wherewith shall the earth be

59
00:02:19,568 --> 00:02:20,901
 salted? The salt shall be thenceforth good for

60
00:02:20,901 --> 00:02:22,234
 nothing, but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot

61
00:02:22,234 --> 00:02:23,567
 of men

62
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:26,21
14 Verily, verily, I say unto you, I give unto you

63
00:02:26,21 --> 00:02:28,877
 to be the light of this people. A city that is

64
00:02:28,877 --> 00:02:31,544
 set on a hill cannot be hid

65
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:34,185
15 Behold, do men light a candle and put it under

66
00:02:34,185 --> 00:02:36,852
 a bushel? Nay, but on a candlestick, and it giveth

67
00:02:36,852 --> 00:02:39,519
 light to all that are in the house

68
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:42,16
16 Therefore let your light so shine before this

69
00:02:42,16 --> 00:02:44,827
 people, that they may see your good works and

70
00:02:44,827 --> 00:02:47,494
 glorify your Father who is in heaven

71
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:50,134
17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law or

72
00:02:50,134 --> 00:02:52,801
 the prophets. I am not come to destroy but to

73
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:55,468
 fulfil

74
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:58,109
18 For verily I say unto you, one jot nor one

75
00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:00,776
 tittle hath not passed away from the law, but in me it

76
00:03:00,776 --> 00:03:03,443
 hath all been fulfilled

77
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:04,75
19 And behold, I have given you the law and the

78
00:03:04,75 --> 00:03:06,083
 commandments of my Father, that ye shall believe in

79
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,416
 me, and that ye shall repent of your sins, and

80
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:08,749
 come unto me with a broken heart and a contrite

81
00:03:08,749 --> 00:03:10,082
 spirit. Behold, ye have the commandments before you,

82
00:03:10,082 --> 00:03:11,415
 and the law is fulfilled

83
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:12,991
20 Therefore come unto me and be ye saved; for

84
00:03:12,991 --> 00:03:14,591
 verily I say unto you, that except ye shall keep my

85
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:16,191
 commandments, which I have commanded you at this

86
00:03:16,191 --> 00:03:17,791
 time, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of

87
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,391
 heaven

88
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,366
21 Ye have heard that it hath been said by them of

89
00:03:21,366 --> 00:03:23,366
 old time, and it is also written before you, that

90
00:03:23,366 --> 00:03:25,366
 thou shalt not kill, and whosoever shall kill

91
00:03:25,366 --> 00:03:27,366
 shall be in danger of the judgment of God

92
00:03:27,34 --> 00:03:30,54
22 But I say unto you, that whosoever is angry

93
00:03:30,54 --> 00:03:33,74
 with his brother shall be in danger of his judgment.

94
00:03:33,74 --> 00:03:36,94
 And whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca,

95
00:03:36,94 --> 00:03:40,14
 shall be in danger of the council; and whosoever shall

96
00:03:40,14 --> 00:03:43,34
 say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire

97
00:03:43,29 --> 00:03:45,957
23 Therefore, if ye shall come unto me, or shall

98
00:03:45,957 --> 00:03:48,624
 desire to come unto me, and rememberest that thy

99
00:03:48,624 --> 00:03:51,291
 brother hath aught against thee

100
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,931
24 Go thy way unto thy brother, and first be

101
00:03:53,931 --> 00:03:56,598
 reconciled to thy brother, and then come unto me with

102
00:03:56,598 --> 00:03:59,265
 full purpose of heart, and I will receive you

103
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,906
25 Agree with thine adversary quickly while thou

104
00:04:01,906 --> 00:04:04,573
 art in the way with him, lest at any time he shall

105
00:04:04,573 --> 00:04:07,24
 get thee, and thou shalt be cast into prison

106
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:08,814
26 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, thou shalt by

107
00:04:08,814 --> 00:04:10,414
 no means come out thence until thou hast paid the

108
00:04:10,414 --> 00:04:12,014
 uttermost senine. And while ye are in prison can

109
00:04:12,014 --> 00:04:13,614
 ye pay even one senine? Verily, verily, I say unto

110
00:04:13,614 --> 00:04:15,214
 you, Nay

111
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:19,188
27 Behold, it is written by them of old time, that

112
00:04:19,188 --> 00:04:23,188
 thou shalt not commit adultery

113
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:25,83
28 But I say unto you, that whosoever looketh on a

114
00:04:25,83 --> 00:04:28,497
 woman, to lust after her, hath committed adultery

115
00:04:28,497 --> 00:04:31,164
 already in his heart

116
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:33,805
29 Behold, I give unto you a commandment, that ye

117
00:04:33,805 --> 00:04:36,472
 suffer none of these things to enter into your

118
00:04:36,472 --> 00:04:39,139
 heart

119
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,779
30 For it is better that ye should deny yourselves

120
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:44,446
 of these things, wherein ye will take up your

121
00:04:44,446 --> 00:04:47,113
 cross, than that ye should be cast into hell

122
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,754
31 It hath been written, that whosoever shall put

123
00:04:49,754 --> 00:04:52,421
 away his wife, let him give her a writing of

124
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:55,088
 divorcement

125
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,661
32 Verily, verily, I say unto you, that whosoever

126
00:04:56,661 --> 00:04:58,261
 shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of

127
00:04:58,261 --> 00:04:59,861
 fornication, causeth her to commit adultery; and

128
00:04:59,861 --> 00:05:01,461
 whoso shall marry her who is divorced committeth

129
00:05:01,461 --> 00:05:03,061
 adultery

130
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,703
33 And again it is written, thou shalt not

131
00:05:05,703 --> 00:05:08,37
 forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine

132
00:05:08,37 --> 00:05:11,037
 oaths

133
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:18,511
34 But verily, verily, I say unto you, swear not

134
00:05:18,511 --> 00:05:26,011
 at all; neither by heaven, for it is God’s throne

135
00:05:26,96 --> 00:05:42,96
35 Nor by the earth, for it is his footstool

136
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:46,909
36 Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because

137
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:50,909
 thou canst not make one hair black or white

138
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:56,217
37 But let your communication be Yea, yea; Nay,

139
00:05:56,217 --> 00:06:01,55
 nay; for whatsoever cometh of more than these is

140
00:06:01,55 --> 00:06:06,883
 evil

141
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:18,833
38 And behold, it is written, an eye for an eye,

142
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:30,833
 and a tooth for a tooth

143
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:33,424
39 But I say unto you, that ye shall not resist

144
00:06:33,424 --> 00:06:36,091
 evil, but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right

145
00:06:36,091 --> 00:06:38,758
 cheek, turn to him the other also

146
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:42,732
40 And if any man will sue thee at the law and

147
00:06:42,732 --> 00:06:46,732
 take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also

148
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:50,706
41 And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile,

149
00:06:50,706 --> 00:06:54,706
 go with him twain

150
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:58,681
42 Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that

151
00:06:58,681 --> 00:07:02,681
 would borrow of thee turn thou not away

152
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:06,656
43 And behold it is written also, that thou shalt

153
00:07:06,656 --> 00:07:10,656
 love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy

154
00:07:10,63 --> 00:07:12,63
44 But behold I say unto you, love your enemies,

155
00:07:12,63 --> 00:07:14,63
 bless them that curse you, do good to them that

156
00:07:14,63 --> 00:07:16,63
 hate you, and pray for them who despitefully use you

157
00:07:16,63 --> 00:07:18,63
 and persecute you

158
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:26,605
45 That ye may be the children of your Father who

159
00:07:26,605 --> 00:07:34,605
 is in heaven; for he maketh his sun to rise on the

160
00:07:34,605 --> 00:07:42,605
 evil and on the good

161
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:45,196
46 Therefore those things which were of old time,

162
00:07:45,196 --> 00:07:47,863
 which were under the law, in me are all fulfilled

163
00:07:47,863 --> 00:07:50,53


164
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:54,503
47 Old things are done away, and all things have

165
00:07:54,503 --> 00:07:58,503
 become new

166
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,145
48 Therefore I would that ye should be perfect

167
00:07:59,145 --> 00:07:59,812
 even as I, or your Father who is in heaven is

168
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:00,479
 perfect.
