00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:06,0
Chapter 2 Wickedness and abominations

2
00:00:06,0 --> 00:00:12,0
increase among the people—The Nephites and

3
00:00:12,0 --> 00:00:18,0
Lamanites unite to defend themselves against the

4
00:00:18,0 --> 00:00:24,0
Gadianton robbers—Converted Lamanites become

5
00:00:24,0 --> 00:00:30,23
white and are called Nephites. About A.D. 5–16. 

6
00:00:30,23 --> 00:00:31,341
1 And it came to pass that thus passed

7
00:00:31,341 --> 00:00:32,452
away the ninety and fifth year also, and

8
00:00:32,452 --> 00:00:33,563
the people began to forget those signs

9
00:00:33,563 --> 00:00:34,674
and wonders which they had heard, and

10
00:00:34,674 --> 00:00:35,785
began to be less and less astonished at a

11
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:36,896
sign or a wonder from heaven, insomuch

12
00:00:36,896 --> 00:00:38,007
that they began to be hard in their

13
00:00:38,007 --> 00:00:39,118
hearts, and blind in their minds, and began to

14
00:00:39,118 --> 00:00:40,14
disbelieve all which they had heard and seen—

15
00:00:40,14 --> 00:00:40,029
2 Imagining up some vain thing in their

16
00:00:40,029 --> 00:00:39,918
hearts, that it was wrought by men and

17
00:00:39,918 --> 00:00:39,807
by the power of the devil, to lead

18
00:00:39,807 --> 00:00:39,696
away and deceive the hearts of the people;

19
00:00:39,696 --> 00:00:39,585
and thus did Satan get possession of

20
00:00:39,585 --> 00:00:39,474
the hearts of the people again, insomuch

21
00:00:39,474 --> 00:00:39,363
that he did blind their eyes and lead

22
00:00:39,363 --> 00:00:39,252
them away to believe that the doctrine

23
00:00:39,252 --> 00:00:39,206
of Christ was a foolish and a vain thing.

24
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:39,081
3 And it came to pass that the people

25
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:38,956
began to wax strong in wickedness and

26
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:38,831
abominations; and they did not believe

27
00:00:38,831 --> 00:00:38,706
that there should be any more signs or

28
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:38,581
wonders given; and Satan did go about,

29
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:38,456
leading away the hearts of the people,

30
00:00:38,456 --> 00:00:38,331
tempting them and causing them that they

31
00:00:38,331 --> 00:00:38,272
should do great wickedness in the land.

32
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:39,072
4 And thus did pass away the

33
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:39,872
ninety and sixth year; and also the

34
00:00:39,872 --> 00:00:40,672
ninety and seventh year; and

35
00:00:40,672 --> 00:00:41,472
also the ninety and eighth year;

36
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:42,676
and also the ninety and ninth year;

37
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:47,176
5 And also an hundred years

38
00:00:47,176 --> 00:00:51,676
had passed away since the

39
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:56,176
days of Mosiah, who was king

40
00:00:56,176 --> 00:01:00,994
over the people of the Nephites.

41
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:05,994
6 And six hundred and

42
00:01:05,994 --> 00:01:10,994
nine years had passed away

43
00:01:10,994 --> 00:01:15,275
since Lehi left Jerusalem.

44
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:15,942
7 And nine years had

45
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:16,609
passed away from the time

46
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:17,276
when the sign was given,

47
00:01:17,276 --> 00:01:17,943
which was spoken of by

48
00:01:17,943 --> 00:01:18,61
the prophets, that Christ

49
00:01:18,61 --> 00:01:19,68
should come into the world.

50
00:01:19,68 --> 00:01:20,68
8 Now the Nephites

51
00:01:20,68 --> 00:01:21,68
began to reckon their

52
00:01:21,68 --> 00:01:22,68
time from this period

53
00:01:22,68 --> 00:01:23,68
when the sign was given,

54
00:01:23,68 --> 00:01:24,68
or from the coming of

55
00:01:24,68 --> 00:01:25,68
Christ; therefore,

56
00:01:25,68 --> 00:01:26,019
nine years had passed away.

57
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:30,894
9 And Nephi, who was

58
00:01:30,894 --> 00:01:35,769
the father of

59
00:01:35,769 --> 00:01:40,644
Nephi, who had the charge

60
00:01:40,644 --> 00:01:45,519
of the records, did

61
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:50,394
not return to the

62
00:01:50,394 --> 00:01:55,269
land of Zarahemla,

63
00:01:55,269 --> 00:02:00,144
and could nowhere be

64
00:02:00,144 --> 00:02:05,425
found in all the land.

65
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:05,733
10 And it came to

66
00:02:05,733 --> 00:02:06,041
pass that the

67
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:06,349
people did still

68
00:02:06,349 --> 00:02:06,657
remain in wickedness,

69
00:02:06,657 --> 00:02:06,965
notwithstanding the

70
00:02:06,965 --> 00:02:07,273
much preaching

71
00:02:07,273 --> 00:02:07,581
and prophesying

72
00:02:07,581 --> 00:02:07,889
which was sent among

73
00:02:07,889 --> 00:02:08,197
them; and thus

74
00:02:08,197 --> 00:02:08,505
passed away the tenth

75
00:02:08,505 --> 00:02:08,813
year also; and the

76
00:02:08,813 --> 00:02:09,121
eleventh year

77
00:02:09,121 --> 00:02:09,83
also passed away in iniquity.

78
00:02:09,83 --> 00:02:10,83
11 And it came to

79
00:02:10,83 --> 00:02:11,83
pass in the

80
00:02:11,83 --> 00:02:12,83
thirteenth year there

81
00:02:12,83 --> 00:02:13,83
began to be wars

82
00:02:13,83 --> 00:02:14,83
and contentions

83
00:02:14,83 --> 00:02:15,83
throughout all

84
00:02:15,83 --> 00:02:16,83
the land; for the

85
00:02:16,83 --> 00:02:17,83
Gadianton robbers

86
00:02:17,83 --> 00:02:18,83
had become so

87
00:02:18,83 --> 00:02:19,83
numerous, and did

88
00:02:19,83 --> 00:02:20,83
slay so many of the

89
00:02:20,83 --> 00:02:21,83
people, and did

90
00:02:21,83 --> 00:02:22,83
lay waste so many

91
00:02:22,83 --> 00:02:23,83
cities, and did

92
00:02:23,83 --> 00:02:24,83
spread so much

93
00:02:24,83 --> 00:02:25,83
death and carnage

94
00:02:25,83 --> 00:02:26,83
throughout the

95
00:02:26,83 --> 00:02:27,83
land, that it became

96
00:02:27,83 --> 00:02:28,83
expedient that

97
00:02:28,83 --> 00:02:29,83
all the people,

98
00:02:29,83 --> 00:02:30,83
both the Nephites

99
00:02:30,83 --> 00:02:31,83
and the Lamanites,

100
00:02:31,83 --> 00:02:32,085
should take up arms against them.

101
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:32,433
12 Therefore,

102
00:02:32,433 --> 00:02:32,781
all the Lamanites

103
00:02:32,781 --> 00:02:33,129
who had become

104
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:33,477
converted unto

105
00:02:33,477 --> 00:02:33,825
the Lord did unite

106
00:02:33,825 --> 00:02:34,173
with their

107
00:02:34,173 --> 00:02:34,521
brethren, the

108
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:34,869
Nephites, and were

109
00:02:34,869 --> 00:02:35,217
compelled, for the

110
00:02:35,217 --> 00:02:35,565
safety of their

111
00:02:35,565 --> 00:02:35,913
lives and their

112
00:02:35,913 --> 00:02:36,261
women and their

113
00:02:36,261 --> 00:02:36,609
children, to

114
00:02:36,609 --> 00:02:36,957
take up arms

115
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:37,305
against those

116
00:02:37,305 --> 00:02:37,653
Gadianton robbers, yea,

117
00:02:37,653 --> 00:02:38,001
and also to

118
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:38,349
maintain their

119
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:38,697
rights, and the

120
00:02:38,697 --> 00:02:39,045
privileges of their

121
00:02:39,045 --> 00:02:39,393
church and of

122
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:39,741
their worship, and

123
00:02:39,741 --> 00:02:40,494
their freedom and their liberty.

124
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,161
13 And it came

125
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:43,828
to pass that

126
00:02:43,828 --> 00:02:45,495
before this

127
00:02:45,495 --> 00:02:47,162
thirteenth year

128
00:02:47,162 --> 00:02:48,829
had passed

129
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:50,496
away the Nephites

130
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,163
were

131
00:02:52,163 --> 00:02:53,83
threatened with utter

132
00:02:53,83 --> 00:02:55,497
destruction

133
00:02:55,497 --> 00:02:57,164
because of this

134
00:02:57,164 --> 00:02:58,831
war, which had

135
00:02:58,831 --> 00:03:00,38
become exceedingly sore.

136
00:03:00,38 --> 00:03:01,255
14 And it

137
00:03:01,255 --> 00:03:02,13
came to pass

138
00:03:02,13 --> 00:03:03,005
that those

139
00:03:03,005 --> 00:03:03,88
Lamanites who had

140
00:03:03,88 --> 00:03:04,755
united with

141
00:03:04,755 --> 00:03:05,63
the Nephites

142
00:03:05,63 --> 00:03:06,505
were numbered

143
00:03:06,505 --> 00:03:07,888
among the Nephites;

144
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:08,317
15 And their

145
00:03:08,317 --> 00:03:08,746
curse was

146
00:03:08,746 --> 00:03:09,175
taken from them,

147
00:03:09,175 --> 00:03:09,604
and their

148
00:03:09,604 --> 00:03:10,033
skin became

149
00:03:10,033 --> 00:03:10,462
white like unto

150
00:03:10,462 --> 00:03:10,29
the Nephites;

151
00:03:10,29 --> 00:03:10,79
16 And their

152
00:03:10,79 --> 00:03:11,29
young men

153
00:03:11,29 --> 00:03:11,79
and their

154
00:03:11,79 --> 00:03:12,29
daughters

155
00:03:12,29 --> 00:03:12,79
became

156
00:03:12,79 --> 00:03:13,29
exceedingly fair, and

157
00:03:13,29 --> 00:03:13,79
they were

158
00:03:13,79 --> 00:03:14,29
numbered among

159
00:03:14,29 --> 00:03:14,79
the

160
00:03:14,79 --> 00:03:15,29
Nephites, and were

161
00:03:15,29 --> 00:03:15,79
called

162
00:03:15,79 --> 00:03:16,29
Nephites. And

163
00:03:16,29 --> 00:03:16,79
thus ended the

164
00:03:16,79 --> 00:03:17,798
thirteenth year.

165
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:17,901
17 And it

166
00:03:17,901 --> 00:03:18,004
came to pass

167
00:03:18,004 --> 00:03:18,107
in the

168
00:03:18,107 --> 00:03:18,21
commencement

169
00:03:18,21 --> 00:03:18,313
of the

170
00:03:18,313 --> 00:03:18,416
fourteenth year,

171
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:18,519
the war

172
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:18,622
between the

173
00:03:18,622 --> 00:03:18,725
robbers and

174
00:03:18,725 --> 00:03:18,828
the people

175
00:03:18,828 --> 00:03:18,931
of Nephi

176
00:03:18,931 --> 00:03:19,034
did continue

177
00:03:19,034 --> 00:03:19,137
and did

178
00:03:19,137 --> 00:03:19,24
become

179
00:03:19,24 --> 00:03:19,343
exceedingly sore;

180
00:03:19,343 --> 00:03:19,446


181
00:03:19,446 --> 00:03:19,549
nevertheless, the

182
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:19,652
people of Nephi

183
00:03:19,652 --> 00:03:19,755
did gain

184
00:03:19,755 --> 00:03:19,858
some

185
00:03:19,858 --> 00:03:19,961
advantage of the

186
00:03:19,961 --> 00:03:20,064
robbers,

187
00:03:20,064 --> 00:03:20,167
insomuch that

188
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:20,27
they did

189
00:03:20,27 --> 00:03:20,373
drive them

190
00:03:20,373 --> 00:03:20,476
back out of

191
00:03:20,476 --> 00:03:20,579
their lands

192
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:20,682
into the

193
00:03:20,682 --> 00:03:20,2
mountains and into their secret places.

194
00:03:20,2 --> 00:03:20,16
18 And

195
00:03:20,16 --> 00:03:20,12
thus ended

196
00:03:20,12 --> 00:03:20,08
the

197
00:03:20,08 --> 00:03:20,04
fourteenth year.

198
00:03:20,04 --> 00:03:20,0
And in the

199
00:03:20,0 --> 00:03:19,96
fifteenth

200
00:03:19,96 --> 00:03:19,92
year they

201
00:03:19,92 --> 00:03:19,88
did come

202
00:03:19,88 --> 00:03:19,84
forth

203
00:03:19,84 --> 00:03:19,8
against the

204
00:03:19,8 --> 00:03:19,76
people of

205

Nephi; and

206
00:03:19,72 --> 00:03:19,68
because of

207
00:03:19,68 --> 00:03:19,64
the

208
00:03:19,64 --> 00:03:19,6
wickedness of the

209
00:03:19,6 --> 00:03:19,56

210
00:03:19,56 --> 00:03:19,52
Nephi,

211
00:03:19,52 --> 00:03:19,48

212
00:03:19,48 --> 00:03:19,44
many

213
00:03:19,44 --> 00:03:19,4

00:03:19,4 --> 00:03:19,36


215
00:03:19,36 --> 00:03:19,32
dissensions, the

218
00:03:19,24 --> 00:03:19,266
gain many advantages over them.

219
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:19,933
19 And

220
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:20,6
thus ended

224
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:23,268
thus were

225
00:03:23,268 --> 00:03:23,935
the people

226
00:03:23,935 --> 00:03:24,602
in a

227
00:03:24,602 --> 00:03:25,269
state of many

229
00:03:25,936 --> 00:03:26,603
afflictions; and

230
00:03:26,603 --> 00:03:27,27
the sword

231
00:03:27,27 --> 00:03:27,937
of

232
00:03:27,937 --> 00:03:28,604
destruction

233
00:03:28,604 --> 00:03:29,271
did hang

234
00:03:29,271 --> 00:03:29,938
over them,

235
00:03:29,938 --> 00:03:30,605
insomuch

236
00:03:30,605 --> 00:03:31,272
that they

237
00:03:31,272 --> 00:03:31,939
were

238
00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:32,606
about to be

239
00:03:32,606 --> 00:03:33,273

240
00:03:33,273 --> 00:03:33,94
down by

241
00:03:33,94 --> 00:03:34,607
it, and

242
00:03:34,607 --> 00:03:35,682
this because of their iniquity.
