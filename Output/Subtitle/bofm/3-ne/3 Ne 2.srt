00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 2 Wickedness and abominations

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
increase among the people—The Nephites and

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Lamanites unite to defend themselves against the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Gadianton robbers—Converted Lamanites become

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:20:09,
white and are called Nephites. About A.D. 5–16. 

6
00:20:09,0 --> 00:20:09,0
1 And it came to pass that thus passed

7
00:20:09,0 --> 00:20:09,0
away the ninety and fifth year also, and

8
00:20:09,0 --> 00:20:09,0
the people began to forget those signs

9
00:20:09,0 --> 00:20:09,0
and wonders which they had heard, and

10
00:20:09,0 --> 00:20:09,0
began to be less and less astonished at a

11
00:20:09,0 --> 00:20:09,0
sign or a wonder from heaven, insomuch

12
00:20:09,0 --> 00:20:09,0
that they began to be hard in their

13
00:20:09,0 --> 00:20:09,0
hearts, and blind in their minds, and began to

14
00:20:09,0 --> 00:19:41,
disbelieve all which they had heard and seen—

15
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:41,0
2 Imagining up some vain thing in their

16
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:41,0
hearts, that it was wrought by men and

17
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:41,0
by the power of the devil, to lead

18
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:41,0
away and deceive the hearts of the people;

19
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:41,0
and thus did Satan get possession of

20
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:41,0
the hearts of the people again, insomuch

21
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:41,0
that he did blind their eyes and lead

22
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:41,0
them away to believe that the doctrine

23
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:13,
of Christ was a foolish and a vain thing.

24
00:19:13,0 --> 00:19:13,0
3 And it came to pass that the people

25
00:19:13,0 --> 00:19:13,0
began to wax strong in wickedness and

26
00:19:13,0 --> 00:19:13,0
abominations; and they did not believe

27
00:19:13,0 --> 00:19:13,0
that there should be any more signs or

28
00:19:13,0 --> 00:19:13,0
wonders given; and Satan did go about,

29
00:19:13,0 --> 00:19:13,0
leading away the hearts of the people,

30
00:19:13,0 --> 00:19:13,0
tempting them and causing them that they

31
00:19:13,0 --> 00:21:25,
should do great wickedness in the land.

32
00:21:25,0 --> 00:21:25,0
4 And thus did pass away the

33
00:21:25,0 --> 00:21:25,0
ninety and sixth year; and also the

34
00:21:25,0 --> 00:21:25,0
ninety and seventh year; and

35
00:21:25,0 --> 00:21:25,0
also the ninety and eighth year;

36
00:21:25,0 --> 00:35:33,
and also the ninety and ninth year;

37
00:35:33,0 --> 00:35:33,0
5 And also an hundred years

38
00:35:33,0 --> 00:35:33,0
had passed away since the

39
00:35:33,0 --> 00:35:33,0
days of Mosiah, who was king

40
00:35:33,0 --> 00:35:47,
over the people of the Nephites.

41
00:35:47,0 --> 00:35:47,0
6 And six hundred and

42
00:35:47,0 --> 00:35:47,0
nine years had passed away

43
00:35:47,0 --> 00:40:58,
since Lehi left Jerusalem.

44
00:40:58,0 --> 00:40:58,0
7 And nine years had

45
00:40:58,0 --> 00:40:58,0
passed away from the time

46
00:40:58,0 --> 00:40:58,0
when the sign was given,

47
00:40:58,0 --> 00:40:58,0
which was spoken of by

48
00:40:58,0 --> 00:40:58,0
the prophets, that Christ

49
00:40:58,0 --> 00:40:30,
should come into the world.

50
00:40:30,0 --> 00:40:30,0
8 Now the Nephites

51
00:40:30,0 --> 00:40:30,0
began to reckon their

52
00:40:30,0 --> 00:40:30,0
time from this period

53
00:40:30,0 --> 00:40:30,0
when the sign was given,

54
00:40:30,0 --> 00:40:30,0
or from the coming of

55
00:40:30,0 --> 00:40:30,0
Christ; therefore,

56
00:40:30,0 --> 00:42:42,
nine years had passed away.

57
00:42:42,0 --> 00:42:42,0
9 And Nephi, who was

58
00:42:42,0 --> 00:42:42,0
the father of

59
00:42:42,0 --> 00:42:42,0
Nephi, who had the charge

60
00:42:42,0 --> 00:42:42,0
of the records, did

61
00:42:42,0 --> 00:42:42,0
not return to the

62
00:42:42,0 --> 00:42:42,0
land of Zarahemla,

63
00:42:42,0 --> 00:42:42,0
and could nowhere be

64
00:42:42,0 --> 00:47:39,
found in all the land.

65
00:47:39,0 --> 00:47:39,0
10 And it came to

66
00:47:39,0 --> 00:47:39,0
pass that the

67
00:47:39,0 --> 00:47:39,0
people did still

68
00:47:39,0 --> 00:47:39,0
remain in wickedness,

69
00:47:39,0 --> 00:47:39,0
notwithstanding the

70
00:47:39,0 --> 00:47:39,0
much preaching

71
00:47:39,0 --> 00:47:39,0
and prophesying

72
00:47:39,0 --> 00:47:39,0
which was sent among

73
00:47:39,0 --> 00:47:39,0
them; and thus

74
00:47:39,0 --> 00:47:39,0
passed away the tenth

75
00:47:39,0 --> 00:47:39,0
year also; and the

76
00:47:39,0 --> 00:47:39,0
eleventh year

77
00:47:39,0 --> 00:50:49,
also passed away in iniquity.

78
00:50:49,0 --> 00:50:49,0
11 And it came to

79
00:50:49,0 --> 00:50:49,0
pass in the

80
00:50:49,0 --> 00:50:49,0
thirteenth year there

81
00:50:49,0 --> 00:50:49,0
began to be wars

82
00:50:49,0 --> 00:50:49,0
and contentions

83
00:50:49,0 --> 00:50:49,0
throughout all

84
00:50:49,0 --> 00:50:49,0
the land; for the

85
00:50:49,0 --> 00:50:49,0
Gadianton robbers

86
00:50:49,0 --> 00:50:49,0
had become so

87
00:50:49,0 --> 00:50:49,0
numerous, and did

88
00:50:49,0 --> 00:50:49,0
slay so many of the

89
00:50:49,0 --> 00:50:49,0
people, and did

90
00:50:49,0 --> 00:50:49,0
lay waste so many

91
00:50:49,0 --> 00:50:49,0
cities, and did

92
00:50:49,0 --> 00:50:49,0
spread so much

93
00:50:49,0 --> 00:50:49,0
death and carnage

94
00:50:49,0 --> 00:50:49,0
throughout the

95
00:50:49,0 --> 00:50:49,0
land, that it became

96
00:50:49,0 --> 00:50:49,0
expedient that

97
00:50:49,0 --> 00:50:49,0
all the people,

98
00:50:49,0 --> 00:50:49,0
both the Nephites

99
00:50:49,0 --> 00:50:49,0
and the Lamanites,

100
00:50:49,0 --> 00:57:57,
should take up arms against them.

101
00:57:57,0 --> 00:57:57,0
12 Therefore,

102
00:57:57,0 --> 00:57:57,0
all the Lamanites

103
00:57:57,0 --> 00:57:57,0
who had become

104
00:57:57,0 --> 00:57:57,0
converted unto

105
00:57:57,0 --> 00:57:57,0
the Lord did unite

106
00:57:57,0 --> 00:57:57,0
with their

107
00:57:57,0 --> 00:57:57,0
brethren, the

108
00:57:57,0 --> 00:57:57,0
Nephites, and were

109
00:57:57,0 --> 00:57:57,0
compelled, for the

110
00:57:57,0 --> 00:57:57,0
safety of their

111
00:57:57,0 --> 00:57:57,0
lives and their

112
00:57:57,0 --> 00:57:57,0
women and their

113
00:57:57,0 --> 00:57:57,0
children, to

114
00:57:57,0 --> 00:57:57,0
take up arms

115
00:57:57,0 --> 00:57:57,0
against those

116
00:57:57,0 --> 00:57:57,0
Gadianton robbers, yea,

117
00:57:57,0 --> 00:57:57,0
and also to

118
00:57:57,0 --> 00:57:57,0
maintain their

119
00:57:57,0 --> 00:57:57,0
rights, and the

120
00:57:57,0 --> 00:57:57,0
privileges of their

121
00:57:57,0 --> 00:57:57,0
church and of

122
00:57:57,0 --> 00:57:57,0
their worship, and

123
00:57:57,0 --> 00:57:29,
their freedom and their liberty.

124
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:29,0
13 And it came

125
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:29,0
to pass that

126
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:29,0
before this

127
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:29,0
thirteenth year

128
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:29,0
had passed

129
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:29,0
away the Nephites

130
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:29,0
were

131
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:29,0
threatened with utter

132
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:29,0
destruction

133
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:29,0
because of this

134
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:29,0
war, which had

135
00:57:29,0 --> 01:08:58,
become exceedingly sore.

136
01:08:58,0 --> 01:08:58,0
14 And it

137
01:08:58,0 --> 01:08:58,0
came to pass

138
01:08:58,0 --> 01:08:58,0
that those

139
01:08:58,0 --> 01:08:58,0
Lamanites who had

140
01:08:58,0 --> 01:08:58,0
united with

141
01:08:58,0 --> 01:08:58,0
the Nephites

142
01:08:58,0 --> 01:08:58,0
were numbered

143
01:08:58,0 --> 01:08:30,
among the Nephites;

144
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
15 And their

145
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
curse was

146
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
taken from them,

147
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
and their

148
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
skin became

149
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
white like unto

150
01:08:30,0 --> 01:13:40,
the Nephites;

151
01:13:40,0 --> 01:13:40,0
16 And their

152
01:13:40,0 --> 01:13:40,0
young men

153
01:13:40,0 --> 01:13:40,0
and their

154
01:13:40,0 --> 01:13:40,0
daughters

155
01:13:40,0 --> 01:13:40,0
became

156
01:13:40,0 --> 01:13:40,0
exceedingly fair, and

157
01:13:40,0 --> 01:13:40,0
they were

158
01:13:40,0 --> 01:13:40,0
numbered among

159
01:13:40,0 --> 01:13:40,0
the

160
01:13:40,0 --> 01:13:40,0
Nephites, and were

161
01:13:40,0 --> 01:13:40,0
called

162
01:13:40,0 --> 01:13:40,0
Nephites. And

163
01:13:40,0 --> 01:13:40,0
thus ended the

164
01:13:40,0 --> 01:13:12,
thirteenth year.

165
01:13:12,0 --> 01:13:12,0
17 And it

166
01:13:12,0 --> 01:13:12,0
came to pass

167
01:13:12,0 --> 01:13:12,0
in the

168
01:13:12,0 --> 01:13:12,0
commencement

169
01:13:12,0 --> 01:13:12,0
of the

170
01:13:12,0 --> 01:13:12,0
fourteenth year,

171
01:13:12,0 --> 01:13:12,0
the war

172
01:13:12,0 --> 01:13:12,0
between the

173
01:13:12,0 --> 01:13:12,0
robbers and

174
01:13:12,0 --> 01:13:12,0
the people

175
01:13:12,0 --> 01:13:12,0
of Nephi

176
01:13:12,0 --> 01:13:12,0
did continue

177
01:13:12,0 --> 01:13:12,0
and did

178
01:13:12,0 --> 01:13:12,0
become

179
01:13:12,0 --> 01:13:12,0
exceedingly sore;

180
01:13:12,0 --> 01:13:12,0


181
01:13:12,0 --> 01:13:12,0
nevertheless, the

182
01:13:12,0 --> 01:13:12,0
people of Nephi

183
01:13:12,0 --> 01:13:12,0
did gain

184
01:13:12,0 --> 01:13:12,0
some

185
01:13:12,0 --> 01:13:12,0
advantage of the

186
01:13:12,0 --> 01:13:12,0
robbers,

187
01:13:12,0 --> 01:13:12,0
insomuch that

188
01:13:12,0 --> 01:13:12,0
they did

189
01:13:12,0 --> 01:13:12,0
drive them

190
01:13:12,0 --> 01:13:12,0
back out of

191
01:13:12,0 --> 01:13:12,0
their lands

192
01:13:12,0 --> 01:13:12,0
into the

193
01:13:12,0 --> 01:18:22,
mountains and into their secret places.

194
01:18:22,0 --> 01:18:22,0
18 And

195
01:18:22,0 --> 01:18:22,0
thus ended

196
01:18:22,0 --> 01:18:22,0
the

197
01:18:22,0 --> 01:18:22,0
fourteenth year.

198
01:18:22,0 --> 01:18:22,0
And in the

199
01:18:22,0 --> 01:18:22,0
fifteenth

200
01:18:22,0 --> 01:18:22,0
year they

201
01:18:22,0 --> 01:18:22,0
did come

202
01:18:22,0 --> 01:18:22,0
forth

203
01:18:22,0 --> 01:18:22,0
against the

204
01:18:22,0 --> 01:18:22,0
people of

205
01:18:22,0 --> 01:18:22,0
Nephi; and

206
01:18:22,0 --> 01:18:22,0
because of

207
01:18:22,0 --> 01:18:22,0
the

208
01:18:22,0 --> 01:18:22,0
wickedness of the

209
01:18:22,0 --> 01:18:22,0
people of

210
01:18:22,0 --> 01:18:22,0
Nephi,

211
01:18:22,0 --> 01:18:22,0
and their

212
01:18:22,0 --> 01:18:22,0
many

213
01:18:22,0 --> 01:18:22,0
contentions and

214
01:18:22,0 --> 01:18:22,0


215
01:18:22,0 --> 01:18:22,0
dissensions, the

216
01:18:22,0 --> 01:18:22,0
Gadianton

217
01:18:22,0 --> 01:18:22,0
robbers did

218
01:18:22,0 --> 01:20:34,
gain many advantages over them.

219
01:20:34,0 --> 01:20:34,0
19 And

220
01:20:34,0 --> 01:20:34,0
thus ended

221
01:20:34,0 --> 01:20:34,0
the

222
01:20:34,0 --> 01:20:34,0
fifteenth

223
01:20:34,0 --> 01:20:34,0
year, and

224
01:20:34,0 --> 01:20:34,0
thus were

225
01:20:34,0 --> 01:20:34,0
the people

226
01:20:34,0 --> 01:20:34,0
in a

227
01:20:34,0 --> 01:20:34,0
state of many

228
01:20:34,0 --> 01:20:34,0


229
01:20:34,0 --> 01:20:34,0
afflictions; and

230
01:20:34,0 --> 01:20:34,0
the sword

231
01:20:34,0 --> 01:20:34,0
of

232
01:20:34,0 --> 01:20:34,0
destruction

233
01:20:34,0 --> 01:20:34,0
did hang

234
01:20:34,0 --> 01:20:34,0
over them,

235
01:20:34,0 --> 01:20:34,0
insomuch

236
01:20:34,0 --> 01:20:34,0
that they

237
01:20:34,0 --> 01:20:34,0
were

238
01:20:34,0 --> 01:20:34,0
about to be

239
01:20:34,0 --> 01:20:34,0
smitten

240
01:20:34,0 --> 01:20:34,0
down by

241
01:20:34,0 --> 01:20:34,0
it, and

242
01:20:34,0 --> 01:24:04,
this because of their iniquity.
