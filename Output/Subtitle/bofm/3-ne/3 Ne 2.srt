00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:08,6
Chapter 2 Wickedness and abominations increase

2
00:00:08,6 --> 00:00:17,2
 among the people—The Nephites and Lamanites unite to

3
00:00:17,2 --> 00:00:25,8
 defend themselves against the Gadianton

4
00:00:25,8 --> 00:00:34,4
 robbers—Converted Lamanites become white and are called

5
00:00:34,4 --> 00:00:43,0
 Nephites. About A.D. 5–16.

6
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:48,551
1 And it came to pass that thus passed away the

7
00:00:48,551 --> 00:00:53,926
 ninety and fifth year also, and the people began to

8
00:00:53,926 --> 00:00:59,301
 forget those signs and wonders which they had

9
00:00:59,301 --> 00:01:04,676
 heard, and began to be less and less astonished at a

10
00:01:04,676 --> 00:01:10,051
 sign or a wonder from heaven, insomuch that they

11
00:01:10,051 --> 00:01:15,426
 began to be hard in their hearts, and blind in their

12
00:01:15,426 --> 00:01:20,801
 minds, and began to disbelieve all which they had

13
00:01:20,801 --> 00:01:26,176
 heard and seen

14
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:31,436
2 Imagining up some vain thing in their hearts,

15
00:01:31,436 --> 00:01:36,686
 that it was wrought by men and by the power of the

16
00:01:36,686 --> 00:01:41,936
 devil, to lead away and deceive the hearts of the

17
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:47,186
 people; and thus did Satan get possession of the

18
00:01:47,186 --> 00:01:52,436
 hearts of the people again, insomuch that he did

19
00:01:52,436 --> 00:01:57,686
 blind their eyes and lead them away to believe that

20
00:01:57,686 --> 00:02:02,936
 the doctrine of Christ was a foolish and a vain

21
00:02:02,936 --> 00:02:08,186
 thing

22
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:13,605
3 And it came to pass that the people began to wax

23
00:02:13,605 --> 00:02:18,748
 strong in wickedness and abominations; and they

24
00:02:18,748 --> 00:02:23,891
 did not believe that there should be any more signs

25
00:02:23,891 --> 00:02:29,034
 or wonders given; and Satan did go about, leading

26
00:02:29,034 --> 00:02:34,177
 away the hearts of the people, tempting them and

27
00:02:34,177 --> 00:02:39,32
 causing them that they should do great wickedness

28
00:02:39,32 --> 00:02:44,463
 in the land

29
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:48,614
4 And thus did pass away the ninety and sixth

30
00:02:48,614 --> 00:02:52,864
 year; and also the ninety and seventh year; and also

31
00:02:52,864 --> 00:02:57,114
 the ninety and eighth year; and also the ninety and

32
00:02:57,114 --> 00:03:01,364
 ninth year

33
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:05,681
5 And also an hundred years had passed away since

34
00:03:05,681 --> 00:03:09,681
 the days of Mosiah, who was king over the people

35
00:03:09,681 --> 00:03:13,681
 of the Nephites

36
00:03:13,66 --> 00:03:18,16
6 And six hundred and nine years had passed away

37
00:03:18,16 --> 00:03:22,66
 since Lehi left Jerusalem

38
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:27,635
7 And nine years had passed away from the time

39
00:03:27,635 --> 00:03:32,968
 when the sign was given, which was spoken of by the

40
00:03:32,968 --> 00:03:38,301
 prophets, that Christ should come into the world

41
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:42,518
8 Now the Nephites began to reckon their time from

42
00:03:42,518 --> 00:03:47,018
 this period when the sign was given, or from the

43
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:51,518
 coming of Christ; therefore, nine years had passed

44
00:03:51,518 --> 00:03:56,018
 away

45
00:03:56,87 --> 00:04:02,37
9 And Nephi, who was the father of Nephi, who had

46
00:04:02,37 --> 00:04:07,87
 the charge of the records, did not return to the

47
00:04:07,87 --> 00:04:13,37
 land of Zarahemla, and could nowhere be found in

48
00:04:13,37 --> 00:04:18,87
 all the land

49
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:24,825
10 And it came to pass that the people did still

50
00:04:24,825 --> 00:04:30,825
 remain in wickedness, notwithstanding the much

51
00:04:30,825 --> 00:04:36,825
 preaching and prophesying which was sent among them;

52
00:04:36,825 --> 00:04:42,825
 and thus passed away the tenth year also; and the

53
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:48,825
 eleventh year also passed away in iniquity

54
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:55,644
11 And it came to pass in the thirteenth year

55
00:04:55,644 --> 00:05:02,533
 there began to be wars and contentions throughout all

56
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:09,422
 the land; for the Gadianton robbers had become so

57
00:05:09,422 --> 00:05:16,311
 numerous, and did slay so many of the people, and

58
00:05:16,311 --> 00:05:23,2
 did lay waste so many cities, and did spread so

59
00:05:23,2 --> 00:05:30,089
 much death and carnage throughout the land, that it

60
00:05:30,089 --> 00:05:36,978
 became expedient that all the people, both the

61
00:05:36,978 --> 00:05:43,867
 Nephites and the Lamanites, should take up arms

62
00:05:43,867 --> 00:05:50,756
 against them

63
00:05:50,35 --> 00:05:56,85
12 Therefore, all the Lamanites who had become

64
00:05:56,85 --> 00:06:03,35
 converted unto the Lord did unite with their

65
00:06:03,35 --> 00:06:09,85
 brethren, the Nephites, and were compelled, for the safety

66
00:06:09,85 --> 00:06:16,35
 of their lives and their women and their

67
00:06:16,35 --> 00:06:22,85
 children, to take up arms against those Gadianton robbers,

68
00:06:22,85 --> 00:06:29,35
 yea, and also to maintain their rights, and the

69
00:06:29,35 --> 00:06:35,85
 privileges of their church and of their worship,

70
00:06:35,85 --> 00:06:42,35
 and their freedom and their liberty

71
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:48,269
13 And it came to pass that before this thirteenth

72
00:06:48,269 --> 00:06:53,769
 year had passed away the Nephites were threatened

73
00:06:53,769 --> 00:06:59,269
 with utter destruction because of this war, which

74
00:06:59,269 --> 00:07:04,769
 had become exceedingly sore

75
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:08,491
14 And it came to pass that those Lamanites who

76
00:07:08,491 --> 00:07:12,491
 had united with the Nephites were numbered among the

77
00:07:12,491 --> 00:07:16,491
 Nephites

78
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:23,836
15 And their curse was taken from them, and their

79
00:07:23,836 --> 00:07:30,836
 skin became white like unto the Nephites

80
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:36,116
16 And their young men and their daughters became

81
00:07:36,116 --> 00:07:42,116
 exceedingly fair, and they were numbered among the

82
00:07:42,116 --> 00:07:48,116
 Nephites, and were called Nephites. And thus

83
00:07:48,116 --> 00:07:54,116
 ended the thirteenth year

84
00:07:54,04 --> 00:07:59,611
17 And it came to pass in the commencement of the

85
00:07:59,611 --> 00:08:05,182
 fourteenth year, the war between the robbers and

86
00:08:05,182 --> 00:08:10,753
 the people of Nephi did continue and did become

87
00:08:10,753 --> 00:08:16,324
 exceedingly sore; nevertheless, the people of Nephi

88
00:08:16,324 --> 00:08:21,895
 did gain some advantage of the robbers, insomuch

89
00:08:21,895 --> 00:08:27,466
 that they did drive them back out of their lands

90
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:33,037
 into the mountains and into their secret places

91
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:40,246
18 And thus ended the fourteenth year. And in the

92
00:08:40,246 --> 00:08:46,579
 fifteenth year they did come forth against the

93
00:08:46,579 --> 00:08:52,912
 people of Nephi; and because of the wickedness of the

94
00:08:52,912 --> 00:08:59,245
 people of Nephi, and their many contentions and

95
00:08:59,245 --> 00:09:05,578
 dissensions, the Gadianton robbers did gain many

96
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:11,911
 advantages over them

97
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:18,584
19 And thus ended the fifteenth year, and thus

98
00:09:18,584 --> 00:09:25,984
 were the people in a state of many afflictions; and

99
00:09:25,984 --> 00:09:33,384
 the sword of destruction did hang over them,

100
00:09:33,384 --> 00:09:40,784
 insomuch that they were about to be smitten down by it,

101
00:09:40,784 --> 00:09:48,184
 and this because of their iniquity.
