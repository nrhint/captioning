1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 16 Jesus will visit others of the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
lost sheep of Israel—In the latter days the

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
gospel will go to the Gentiles and then to the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
house of Israel—The Lord’s people will see eye

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:05:11,
to eye when He brings again Zion. About A.D. 34. 

6
00:05:11,0 --> 00:05:11,0
1 And verily, verily, I say unto you

7
00:05:11,0 --> 00:05:11,0
that I have other sheep, which are not of

8
00:05:11,0 --> 00:05:11,0
this land, neither of the land of

9
00:05:11,0 --> 00:05:11,0
Jerusalem, neither in any parts of that land

10
00:05:11,0 --> 00:06:23,
round about whither I have been to minister.

11
00:06:23,0 --> 00:06:23,0
2 For they of whom I speak are

12
00:06:23,0 --> 00:06:23,0
they who have not as yet heard

13
00:06:23,0 --> 00:06:23,0
my voice; neither have I at any

14
00:06:23,0 --> 00:16:33,
time manifested myself unto them.

15
00:16:33,0 --> 00:16:33,0
3 But I have received a

16
00:16:33,0 --> 00:16:33,0
commandment of the Father that I

17
00:16:33,0 --> 00:16:33,0
shall go unto them, and that

18
00:16:33,0 --> 00:16:33,0
they shall hear my voice, and

19
00:16:33,0 --> 00:16:33,0
shall be numbered among my

20
00:16:33,0 --> 00:16:33,0
sheep, that there may be one

21
00:16:33,0 --> 00:16:33,0
fold and one shepherd;

22
00:16:33,0 --> 00:19:15,
therefore I go to show myself unto them.

23
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
4 And I command you that ye

24
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
shall write these sayings

25
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
after I am gone, that if it

26
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
so be that my people at

27
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
Jerusalem, they who have seen

28
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
me and been with me in my

29
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
ministry, do not ask the

30
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
Father in my name, that they

31
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
may receive a knowledge of

32
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
you by the Holy Ghost, and

33
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
also of the other tribes

34
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
whom they know not of, that

35
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
these sayings which ye shall

36
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
write shall be kept and

37
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
shall be manifested unto the

38
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
Gentiles, that through the

39
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
fulness of the Gentiles,

40
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
the remnant of their seed,

41
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
who shall be scattered forth

42
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
upon the face of the earth

43
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
because of their unbelief,

44
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
may be brought in, or may

45
00:19:15,0 --> 00:21:27,
be brought to a knowledge of me, their Redeemer.

46
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
5 And then will I gather

47
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
them in from the four

48
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
quarters of the earth; and

49
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
then will I fulfil the

50
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
covenant which the Father

51
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
hath made unto all the

52
00:21:27,0 --> 00:22:39,
people of the house of Israel.

53
00:22:39,0 --> 00:22:39,0
6 And blessed are the

54
00:22:39,0 --> 00:22:39,0
Gentiles, because of

55
00:22:39,0 --> 00:22:39,0
their belief in me, in and

56
00:22:39,0 --> 00:22:39,0
of the Holy Ghost,

57
00:22:39,0 --> 00:22:39,0
which witnesses unto them

58
00:22:39,0 --> 00:24:51,
of me and of the Father.

59
00:24:51,0 --> 00:24:51,0
7 Behold, because of

60
00:24:51,0 --> 00:24:51,0
their belief in me,

61
00:24:51,0 --> 00:24:51,0
saith the Father, and

62
00:24:51,0 --> 00:24:51,0
because of the

63
00:24:51,0 --> 00:24:51,0
unbelief of you, O house of

64
00:24:51,0 --> 00:24:51,0
Israel, in the

65
00:24:51,0 --> 00:24:51,0
latter day shall the truth

66
00:24:51,0 --> 00:24:51,0
come unto the

67
00:24:51,0 --> 00:24:51,0
Gentiles, that the fulness

68
00:24:51,0 --> 00:24:51,0
of these things shall

69
00:24:51,0 --> 00:32:21,
be made known unto them.

70
00:32:21,0 --> 00:32:21,0
8 But wo, saith the

71
00:32:21,0 --> 00:32:21,0
Father, unto the

72
00:32:21,0 --> 00:32:21,0
unbelieving of the

73
00:32:21,0 --> 00:32:21,0
Gentiles—for

74
00:32:21,0 --> 00:32:21,0
notwithstanding they have

75
00:32:21,0 --> 00:32:21,0
come forth upon the

76
00:32:21,0 --> 00:32:21,0
face of this land,

77
00:32:21,0 --> 00:32:21,0
and have scattered

78
00:32:21,0 --> 00:32:21,0
my people who are

79
00:32:21,0 --> 00:32:21,0
of the house of

80
00:32:21,0 --> 00:32:21,0
Israel; and my people

81
00:32:21,0 --> 00:32:21,0
who are of the

82
00:32:21,0 --> 00:32:21,0
house of Israel have

83
00:32:21,0 --> 00:32:21,0
been cast out from

84
00:32:21,0 --> 00:32:21,0
among them, and have

85
00:32:21,0 --> 00:33:33,
been trodden under feet by them;

86
00:33:33,0 --> 00:33:33,0
9 And because of

87
00:33:33,0 --> 00:33:33,0
the mercies of the

88
00:33:33,0 --> 00:33:33,0
Father unto the

89
00:33:33,0 --> 00:33:33,0
Gentiles, and also

90
00:33:33,0 --> 00:33:33,0
the judgments of

91
00:33:33,0 --> 00:33:33,0
the Father upon my

92
00:33:33,0 --> 00:33:33,0
people who are of

93
00:33:33,0 --> 00:33:33,0
the house of

94
00:33:33,0 --> 00:33:33,0
Israel, verily, verily,

95
00:33:33,0 --> 00:33:33,0
I say unto you,

96
00:33:33,0 --> 00:33:33,0
that after all this,

97
00:33:33,0 --> 00:33:33,0
and I have caused

98
00:33:33,0 --> 00:33:33,0
my people who are

99
00:33:33,0 --> 00:33:33,0
of the house of

100
00:33:33,0 --> 00:33:33,0
Israel to be

101
00:33:33,0 --> 00:33:33,0
smitten, and to be

102
00:33:33,0 --> 00:33:33,0
afflicted, and to be

103
00:33:33,0 --> 00:33:33,0
slain, and to be

104
00:33:33,0 --> 00:33:33,0
cast out from among

105
00:33:33,0 --> 00:33:33,0
them, and to become

106
00:33:33,0 --> 00:33:33,0
hated by them,

107
00:33:33,0 --> 00:33:33,0
and to become a hiss

108
00:33:33,0 --> 00:35:45,
and a byword among them—

109
00:35:45,0 --> 00:35:45,0
10 And thus

110
00:35:45,0 --> 00:35:45,0
commandeth the Father

111
00:35:45,0 --> 00:35:45,0
that I should say

112
00:35:45,0 --> 00:35:45,0
unto you: At

113
00:35:45,0 --> 00:35:45,0
that day when the

114
00:35:45,0 --> 00:35:45,0
Gentiles shall sin

115
00:35:45,0 --> 00:35:45,0
against my

116
00:35:45,0 --> 00:35:45,0
gospel, and shall

117
00:35:45,0 --> 00:35:45,0
reject the fulness of

118
00:35:45,0 --> 00:35:45,0
my gospel, and

119
00:35:45,0 --> 00:35:45,0
shall be lifted up

120
00:35:45,0 --> 00:35:45,0
in the pride of

121
00:35:45,0 --> 00:35:45,0
their hearts above

122
00:35:45,0 --> 00:35:45,0
all nations, and

123
00:35:45,0 --> 00:35:45,0
above all the

124
00:35:45,0 --> 00:35:45,0
people of the whole

125
00:35:45,0 --> 00:35:45,0
earth, and shall

126
00:35:45,0 --> 00:35:45,0
be filled with

127
00:35:45,0 --> 00:35:45,0
all manner of

128
00:35:45,0 --> 00:35:45,0
lyings, and of

129
00:35:45,0 --> 00:35:45,0
deceits, and of

130
00:35:45,0 --> 00:35:45,0
mischiefs, and all

131
00:35:45,0 --> 00:35:45,0
manner of hypocrisy,

132
00:35:45,0 --> 00:35:45,0
and murders, and

133
00:35:45,0 --> 00:35:45,0
priestcrafts, and

134
00:35:45,0 --> 00:35:45,0
whoredoms, and of

135
00:35:45,0 --> 00:35:45,0
secret

136
00:35:45,0 --> 00:35:45,0
abominations; and if they

137
00:35:45,0 --> 00:35:45,0
shall do all

138
00:35:45,0 --> 00:35:45,0
those things, and

139
00:35:45,0 --> 00:35:45,0
shall reject the

140
00:35:45,0 --> 00:35:45,0
fulness of my

141
00:35:45,0 --> 00:35:45,0
gospel, behold, saith

142
00:35:45,0 --> 00:35:45,0
the Father, I will

143
00:35:45,0 --> 00:35:17,
bring the fulness of my gospel from among them.

144
00:35:17,0 --> 00:35:17,0
11 And then will

145
00:35:17,0 --> 00:35:17,0
I remember my

146
00:35:17,0 --> 00:35:17,0
covenant which I

147
00:35:17,0 --> 00:35:17,0
have made unto

148
00:35:17,0 --> 00:35:17,0
my people, O

149
00:35:17,0 --> 00:35:17,0
house of Israel, and

150
00:35:17,0 --> 00:35:17,0
I will bring my

151
00:35:17,0 --> 00:34:49,
gospel unto them.

152
00:34:49,0 --> 00:34:49,0
12 And I will

153
00:34:49,0 --> 00:34:49,0
show unto thee, O

154
00:34:49,0 --> 00:34:49,0
house of Israel,

155
00:34:49,0 --> 00:34:49,0
that the

156
00:34:49,0 --> 00:34:49,0
Gentiles shall not

157
00:34:49,0 --> 00:34:49,0
have power over

158
00:34:49,0 --> 00:34:49,0
you; but I will

159
00:34:49,0 --> 00:34:49,0
remember my

160
00:34:49,0 --> 00:34:49,0
covenant unto you, O

161
00:34:49,0 --> 00:34:49,0
house of Israel,

162
00:34:49,0 --> 00:34:49,0
and ye shall come

163
00:34:49,0 --> 00:34:49,0
unto the

164
00:34:49,0 --> 00:34:49,0
knowledge of the

165
00:34:49,0 --> 00:42:46,
fulness of my gospel.

166
00:42:46,0 --> 00:42:46,0
13 But if the

167
00:42:46,0 --> 00:42:46,0
Gentiles will

168
00:42:46,0 --> 00:42:46,0
repent and return

169
00:42:46,0 --> 00:42:46,0
unto me, saith

170
00:42:46,0 --> 00:42:46,0
the Father,

171
00:42:46,0 --> 00:42:46,0
behold they shall

172
00:42:46,0 --> 00:42:46,0
be numbered

173
00:42:46,0 --> 00:42:46,0
among my people,

174
00:42:46,0 --> 00:42:18,
O house of Israel.

175
00:42:18,0 --> 00:42:18,0
14 And I will

176
00:42:18,0 --> 00:42:18,0
not suffer my

177
00:42:18,0 --> 00:42:18,0
people, who

178
00:42:18,0 --> 00:42:18,0
are of the house

179
00:42:18,0 --> 00:42:18,0
of Israel, to

180
00:42:18,0 --> 00:42:18,0
go through

181
00:42:18,0 --> 00:42:18,0
among them, and

182
00:42:18,0 --> 00:42:18,0
tread them

183
00:42:18,0 --> 00:51:27,
down, saith the Father.

184
00:51:27,0 --> 00:51:27,0
15 But if

185
00:51:27,0 --> 00:51:27,0
they will not

186
00:51:27,0 --> 00:51:27,0
turn unto me,

187
00:51:27,0 --> 00:51:27,0
and hearken

188
00:51:27,0 --> 00:51:27,0
unto my voice,

189
00:51:27,0 --> 00:51:27,0
I will suffer

190
00:51:27,0 --> 00:51:27,0
them, yea, I

191
00:51:27,0 --> 00:51:27,0
will suffer

192
00:51:27,0 --> 00:51:27,0
my people, O

193
00:51:27,0 --> 00:51:27,0
house of

194
00:51:27,0 --> 00:51:27,0
Israel, that they

195
00:51:27,0 --> 00:51:27,0
shall go

196
00:51:27,0 --> 00:51:27,0
through among

197
00:51:27,0 --> 00:51:27,0
them, and shall

198
00:51:27,0 --> 00:51:27,0
tread them

199
00:51:27,0 --> 00:51:27,0
down, and they

200
00:51:27,0 --> 00:51:27,0
shall be as

201
00:51:27,0 --> 00:51:27,0
salt that

202
00:51:27,0 --> 00:51:27,0
hath lost its

203
00:51:27,0 --> 00:51:27,0
savor, which is

204
00:51:27,0 --> 00:51:27,0
thenceforth

205
00:51:27,0 --> 00:51:27,0
good for

206
00:51:27,0 --> 00:51:27,0
nothing but to be

207
00:51:27,0 --> 00:51:27,0
cast out,

208
00:51:27,0 --> 00:51:27,0
and to be

209
00:51:27,0 --> 00:51:27,0
trodden under foot

210
00:51:27,0 --> 00:57:37,
of my people, O house of Israel.

211
00:57:37,0 --> 00:57:37,0
16 Verily,

212
00:57:37,0 --> 00:57:37,0
verily, I say

213
00:57:37,0 --> 00:57:37,0
unto you,

214
00:57:37,0 --> 00:57:37,0
thus hath the

215
00:57:37,0 --> 00:57:37,0
Father

216
00:57:37,0 --> 00:57:37,0
commanded

217
00:57:37,0 --> 00:57:37,0
me—that I should

218
00:57:37,0 --> 00:57:37,0
give unto

219
00:57:37,0 --> 00:57:37,0
this people

220
00:57:37,0 --> 00:57:37,0
