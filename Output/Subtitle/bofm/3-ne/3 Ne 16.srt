1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,4
Chapter 16 Jesus will visit others of the lost

2
00:00:01,4 --> 00:00:02,8
 sheep of Israel—In the latter days the gospel will go

3
00:00:02,8 --> 00:00:04,2
 to the Gentiles and then to the house of

4
00:00:04,2 --> 00:00:05,6
 Israel—The Lord’s people will see eye to eye when He

5
00:00:05,6 --> 00:00:07,0
 brings again Zion. About A.D. 34.

6
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,575
1 And verily, verily, I say unto you that I have

7
00:00:09,575 --> 00:00:11,175
 other sheep, which are not of this land, neither of

8
00:00:11,175 --> 00:00:12,775
 the land of Jerusalem, neither in any parts of

9
00:00:12,775 --> 00:00:14,375
 that land round about whither I have been to

10
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:15,975
 minister

11
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,616
2 For they of whom I speak are they who have not

12
00:00:18,616 --> 00:00:21,283
 as yet heard my voice; neither have I at any time

13
00:00:21,283 --> 00:00:23,95
 manifested myself unto them

14
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,524
3 But I have received a commandment of the Father

15
00:00:25,524 --> 00:00:27,124
 that I shall go unto them, and that they shall

16
00:00:27,124 --> 00:00:28,724
 hear my voice, and shall be numbered among my sheep,

17
00:00:28,724 --> 00:00:30,324
 that there may be one fold and one shepherd;

18
00:00:30,324 --> 00:00:31,924
 therefore I go to show myself unto them

19
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:32,514
4 And I command you that ye shall write these

20
00:00:32,514 --> 00:00:33,129
 sayings after I am gone, that if it so be that my

21
00:00:33,129 --> 00:00:33,744
 people at Jerusalem, they who have seen me and been

22
00:00:33,744 --> 00:00:34,359
 with me in my ministry, do not ask the Father in my

23
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:34,974
 name, that they may receive a knowledge of you by

24
00:00:34,974 --> 00:00:35,589
 the Holy Ghost, and also of the other tribes whom

25
00:00:35,589 --> 00:00:36,204
 they know not of, that these sayings which ye

26
00:00:36,204 --> 00:00:36,819
 shall write shall be kept and shall be manifested unto

27
00:00:36,819 --> 00:00:37,434
 the Gentiles, that through the fulness of the

28
00:00:37,434 --> 00:00:38,049
 Gentiles, the remnant of their seed, who shall be

29
00:00:38,049 --> 00:00:38,664
 scattered forth upon the face of the earth because of

30
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:39,279
 their unbelief, may be brought in, or may be

31
00:00:39,279 --> 00:00:39,894
 brought to a knowledge of me, their Redeemer

32
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:43,873
5 And then will I gather them in from the four

33
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:47,873
 quarters of the earth; and then will I fulfil the

34
00:00:47,873 --> 00:00:51,873
 covenant which the Father hath made unto all the

35
00:00:51,873 --> 00:00:55,873
 people of the house of Israel

36
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:58,489
6 And blessed are the Gentiles, because of their

37
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:01,156
 belief in me, in and of the Holy Ghost, which

38
00:01:01,156 --> 00:01:03,823
 witnesses unto them of me and of the Father

39
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,397
7 Behold, because of their belief in me, saith the

40
00:01:05,397 --> 00:01:06,997
 Father, and because of the unbelief of you, O

41
00:01:06,997 --> 00:01:08,597
 house of Israel, in the latter day shall the truth

42
00:01:08,597 --> 00:01:10,197
 come unto the Gentiles, that the fulness of these

43
00:01:10,197 --> 00:01:11,797
 things shall be made known unto them

44
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:15,201
8 But wo, saith the Father, unto the unbelieving

45
00:01:15,201 --> 00:01:18,63
 of the Gentiles—for notwithstanding they have come

46
00:01:18,63 --> 00:01:22,059
 forth upon the face of this land, and have

47
00:01:22,059 --> 00:01:25,488
 scattered my people who are of the house of Israel; and

48
00:01:25,488 --> 00:01:28,917
 my people who are of the house of Israel have been

49
00:01:28,917 --> 00:01:32,346
 cast out from among them, and have been trodden

50
00:01:32,346 --> 00:01:35,775
 under feet by them

51
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:39,252
9 And because of the mercies of the Father unto

52
00:01:39,252 --> 00:01:42,808
 the Gentiles, and also the judgments of the Father

53
00:01:42,808 --> 00:01:46,364
 upon my people who are of the house of Israel,

54
00:01:46,364 --> 00:01:49,92
 verily, verily, I say unto you, that after all this,

55
00:01:49,92 --> 00:01:53,476
 and I have caused my people who are of the house of

56
00:01:53,476 --> 00:01:57,032
 Israel to be smitten, and to be afflicted, and to

57
00:01:57,032 --> 00:02:00,588
 be slain, and to be cast out from among them, and

58
00:02:00,588 --> 00:02:04,144
 to become hated by them, and to become a hiss and

59
00:02:04,144 --> 00:02:07,7
 a byword among them

60
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:08,209
10 And thus commandeth the Father that I should

61
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:08,824
 say unto you: At that day when the Gentiles shall

62
00:02:08,824 --> 00:02:09,439
 sin against my gospel, and shall reject the fulness

63
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:10,054
 of my gospel, and shall be lifted up in the pride

64
00:02:10,054 --> 00:02:10,669
 of their hearts above all nations, and above all

65
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:11,284
 the people of the whole earth, and shall be filled

66
00:02:11,284 --> 00:02:11,899
 with all manner of lyings, and of deceits, and of

67
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:12,514
 mischiefs, and all manner of hypocrisy, and

68
00:02:12,514 --> 00:02:13,129
 murders, and priestcrafts, and whoredoms, and of secret

69
00:02:13,129 --> 00:02:13,744
 abominations; and if they shall do all those

70
00:02:13,744 --> 00:02:14,359
 things, and shall reject the fulness of my gospel,

71
00:02:14,359 --> 00:02:14,974
 behold, saith the Father, I will bring the fulness of

72
00:02:14,974 --> 00:02:15,589
 my gospel from among them

73
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:18,236
11 And then will I remember my covenant which I

74
00:02:18,236 --> 00:02:20,903
 have made unto my people, O house of Israel, and I

75
00:02:20,903 --> 00:02:23,57
 will bring my gospel unto them

76
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,143
12 And I will show unto thee, O house of Israel,

77
00:02:25,143 --> 00:02:26,743
 that the Gentiles shall not have power over you;

78
00:02:26,743 --> 00:02:28,343
 but I will remember my covenant unto you, O house of

79
00:02:28,343 --> 00:02:29,943
 Israel, and ye shall come unto the knowledge of

80
00:02:29,943 --> 00:02:31,543
 the fulness of my gospel

81
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:34,185
13 But if the Gentiles will repent and return unto

82
00:02:34,185 --> 00:02:36,852
 me, saith the Father, behold they shall be

83
00:02:36,852 --> 00:02:39,519
 numbered among my people, O house of Israel

84
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:42,16
14 And I will not suffer my people, who are of the

85
00:02:42,16 --> 00:02:44,827
 house of Israel, to go through among them, and

86
00:02:44,827 --> 00:02:47,494
 tread them down, saith the Father

87
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:48,467
15 But if they will not turn unto me, and hearken

88
00:02:48,467 --> 00:02:49,467
 unto my voice, I will suffer them, yea, I will

89
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:50,467
 suffer my people, O house of Israel, that they shall

90
00:02:50,467 --> 00:02:51,467
 go through among them, and shall tread them down,

91
00:02:51,467 --> 00:02:52,467
 and they shall be as salt that hath lost its

92
00:02:52,467 --> 00:02:53,467
 savor, which is thenceforth good for nothing but to be

93
00:02:53,467 --> 00:02:54,467
 cast out, and to be trodden under foot of my

94
00:02:54,467 --> 00:02:55,467
 people, O house of Israel

95
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:58,109
16 Verily, verily, I say unto you, thus hath the

96
00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:00,776
 Father commanded me—that I should give unto this

97
00:03:00,776 --> 00:03:03,443
 people this land for their inheritance

98
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:07,417
17 And then the words of the prophet Isaiah shall

99
00:03:07,417 --> 00:03:11,417
 be fulfilled, which say

100
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:14,058
18 Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the

101
00:03:14,058 --> 00:03:16,725
 voice together shall they sing, for they shall see

102
00:03:16,725 --> 00:03:19,392
 eye to eye when the Lord shall bring again Zion

103
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:22,033
19 Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste

104
00:03:22,033 --> 00:03:24,7
 places of Jerusalem; for the Lord hath comforted

105
00:03:24,7 --> 00:03:27,367
 his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem

106
00:03:27,34 --> 00:03:27,34
20 The Lord hath made bare his holy arm in the

107
00:03:27,34 --> 00:03:27,34
 eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the

108
00:03:27,34 --> 00:03:27,34
 earth shall see the salvation of God.
