1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:04,4
Chapter 16 Jesus will visit others of the

2
00:00:04,4 --> 00:00:08,8
lost sheep of Israel—In the latter days the

3
00:00:08,8 --> 00:00:13,2
gospel will go to the Gentiles and then to the

4
00:00:13,2 --> 00:00:17,6
house of Israel—The Lord’s people will see eye

5
00:00:17,6 --> 00:00:22,256
to eye when He brings again Zion. About A.D. 34. 

6
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:23,656
1 And verily, verily, I say unto you

7
00:00:23,656 --> 00:00:25,056
that I have other sheep, which are not of

8
00:00:25,056 --> 00:00:26,456
this land, neither of the land of

9
00:00:26,456 --> 00:00:27,856
Jerusalem, neither in any parts of that land

10
00:00:27,856 --> 00:00:29,263
round about whither I have been to minister.

11
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:31,763
2 For they of whom I speak are

12
00:00:31,763 --> 00:00:34,263
they who have not as yet heard

13
00:00:34,263 --> 00:00:36,763
my voice; neither have I at any

14
00:00:36,763 --> 00:00:39,64
time manifested myself unto them.

15
00:00:39,64 --> 00:00:40,015
3 But I have received a

16
00:00:40,015 --> 00:00:40,39
commandment of the Father that I

17
00:00:40,39 --> 00:00:40,765
shall go unto them, and that

18
00:00:40,765 --> 00:00:41,14
they shall hear my voice, and

19
00:00:41,14 --> 00:00:41,515
shall be numbered among my

20
00:00:41,515 --> 00:00:41,89
sheep, that there may be one

21
00:00:41,89 --> 00:00:42,265
fold and one shepherd;

22
00:00:42,265 --> 00:00:42,042
therefore I go to show myself unto them.

23
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:41,999
4 And I command you that ye

24
00:00:41,999 --> 00:00:41,956
shall write these sayings

25
00:00:41,956 --> 00:00:41,913
after I am gone, that if it

26
00:00:41,913 --> 00:00:41,87
so be that my people at

27
00:00:41,87 --> 00:00:41,827
Jerusalem, they who have seen

28
00:00:41,827 --> 00:00:41,784
me and been with me in my

29
00:00:41,784 --> 00:00:41,741
ministry, do not ask the

30
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:41,698
Father in my name, that they

31
00:00:41,698 --> 00:00:41,655
may receive a knowledge of

32
00:00:41,655 --> 00:00:41,612
you by the Holy Ghost, and

33
00:00:41,612 --> 00:00:41,569
also of the other tribes

34
00:00:41,569 --> 00:00:41,526
whom they know not of, that

35
00:00:41,526 --> 00:00:41,483
these sayings which ye shall

36
00:00:41,483 --> 00:00:41,44
write shall be kept and

37
00:00:41,44 --> 00:00:41,397
shall be manifested unto the

38
00:00:41,397 --> 00:00:41,354
Gentiles, that through the

39
00:00:41,354 --> 00:00:41,311
fulness of the Gentiles,

40
00:00:41,311 --> 00:00:41,268
the remnant of their seed,

41
00:00:41,268 --> 00:00:41,225
who shall be scattered forth

42
00:00:41,225 --> 00:00:41,182
upon the face of the earth

43
00:00:41,182 --> 00:00:41,139
because of their unbelief,

44
00:00:41,139 --> 00:00:41,096
may be brought in, or may

45
00:00:41,096 --> 00:00:41,108
be brought to a knowledge of me, their Redeemer.

46
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:41,679
5 And then will I gather

47
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:42,25
them in from the four

48
00:00:42,25 --> 00:00:42,821
quarters of the earth; and

49
00:00:42,821 --> 00:00:43,392
then will I fulfil the

50
00:00:43,392 --> 00:00:43,963
covenant which the Father

51
00:00:43,963 --> 00:00:44,534
hath made unto all the

52
00:00:44,534 --> 00:00:45,512
people of the house of Israel.

53
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:45,345
6 And blessed are the

54
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:45,178
Gentiles, because of

55
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:45,011
their belief in me, in and

56
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:44,844
of the Holy Ghost,

57
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:44,677
which witnesses unto them

58
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:44,578
of me and of the Father.

59
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:46,942
7 Behold, because of

60
00:00:46,942 --> 00:00:49,306
their belief in me,

61
00:00:49,306 --> 00:00:51,67
saith the Father, and

62
00:00:51,67 --> 00:00:54,034
because of the

63
00:00:54,034 --> 00:00:56,398
unbelief of you, O house of

64
00:00:56,398 --> 00:00:58,762
Israel, in the

65
00:00:58,762 --> 00:01:01,126
latter day shall the truth

66
00:01:01,126 --> 00:01:03,49
come unto the

67
00:01:03,49 --> 00:01:05,854
Gentiles, that the fulness

68
00:01:05,854 --> 00:01:08,218
of these things shall

69
00:01:08,218 --> 00:01:10,904
be made known unto them.

70
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,092
8 But wo, saith the

71
00:01:12,092 --> 00:01:13,28
Father, unto the

72
00:01:13,28 --> 00:01:14,468
unbelieving of the

73
00:01:14,468 --> 00:01:15,656
Gentiles—for

74
00:01:15,656 --> 00:01:16,844
notwithstanding they have

75
00:01:16,844 --> 00:01:18,032
come forth upon the

76
00:01:18,032 --> 00:01:19,22
face of this land,

77
00:01:19,22 --> 00:01:20,408
and have scattered

78
00:01:20,408 --> 00:01:21,596
my people who are

79
00:01:21,596 --> 00:01:22,784
of the house of

80
00:01:22,784 --> 00:01:23,972
Israel; and my people

81
00:01:23,972 --> 00:01:25,16
who are of the

82
00:01:25,16 --> 00:01:26,348
house of Israel have

83
00:01:26,348 --> 00:01:27,536
been cast out from

84
00:01:27,536 --> 00:01:28,724
among them, and have

85
00:01:28,724 --> 00:01:29,222
been trodden under feet by them;

86
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:29,265
9 And because of

87
00:01:29,265 --> 00:01:29,308
the mercies of the

88
00:01:29,308 --> 00:01:29,351
Father unto the

89
00:01:29,351 --> 00:01:29,394
Gentiles, and also

90
00:01:29,394 --> 00:01:29,437
the judgments of

91
00:01:29,437 --> 00:01:29,48
the Father upon my

92
00:01:29,48 --> 00:01:29,523
people who are of

93
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:29,566
the house of

94
00:01:29,566 --> 00:01:29,609
Israel, verily, verily,

95
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:29,652
I say unto you,

96
00:01:29,652 --> 00:01:29,695
that after all this,

97
00:01:29,695 --> 00:01:29,738
and I have caused

98
00:01:29,738 --> 00:01:29,781
my people who are

99
00:01:29,781 --> 00:01:29,824
of the house of

100
00:01:29,824 --> 00:01:29,867
Israel to be

101
00:01:29,867 --> 00:01:29,91
smitten, and to be

102
00:01:29,91 --> 00:01:29,953
afflicted, and to be

103
00:01:29,953 --> 00:01:29,996
slain, and to be

104
00:01:29,996 --> 00:01:30,039
cast out from among

105
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:30,082
them, and to become

106
00:01:30,082 --> 00:01:30,125
hated by them,

107
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:30,168
and to become a hiss

108
00:01:30,168 --> 00:01:30,691
and a byword among them—

109
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:30,662
10 And thus

110
00:01:30,662 --> 00:01:30,633
commandeth the Father

111
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:30,604
that I should say

112
00:01:30,604 --> 00:01:30,575
unto you: At

113
00:01:30,575 --> 00:01:30,546
that day when the

114
00:01:30,546 --> 00:01:30,517
Gentiles shall sin

115
00:01:30,517 --> 00:01:30,488
against my

116
00:01:30,488 --> 00:01:30,459
gospel, and shall

117
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:30,43
reject the fulness of

118
00:01:30,43 --> 00:01:30,401
my gospel, and

119
00:01:30,401 --> 00:01:30,372
shall be lifted up

120
00:01:30,372 --> 00:01:30,343
in the pride of

121
00:01:30,343 --> 00:01:30,314
their hearts above

122
00:01:30,314 --> 00:01:30,285
all nations, and

123
00:01:30,285 --> 00:01:30,256
above all the

124
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:30,227
people of the whole

125
00:01:30,227 --> 00:01:30,198
earth, and shall

126
00:01:30,198 --> 00:01:30,169
be filled with

127
00:01:30,169 --> 00:01:30,14
all manner of

128
00:01:30,14 --> 00:01:30,111
lyings, and of

129
00:01:30,111 --> 00:01:30,082
deceits, and of

130
00:01:30,082 --> 00:01:30,053
mischiefs, and all

131
00:01:30,053 --> 00:01:30,024
manner of hypocrisy,

132
00:01:30,024 --> 00:01:29,995
and murders, and

133
00:01:29,995 --> 00:01:29,966
priestcrafts, and

134
00:01:29,966 --> 00:01:29,937
whoredoms, and of

135
00:01:29,937 --> 00:01:29,908
secret

136
00:01:29,908 --> 00:01:29,879
abominations; and if they

137
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:29,85
shall do all

138
00:01:29,85 --> 00:01:29,821
those things, and

139
00:01:29,821 --> 00:01:29,792
shall reject the

140
00:01:29,792 --> 00:01:29,763
fulness of my

141
00:01:29,763 --> 00:01:29,734
gospel, behold, saith

142
00:01:29,734 --> 00:01:29,705
the Father, I will

143
00:01:29,705 --> 00:01:29,756
bring the fulness of my gospel from among them.

144
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:33,506
11 And then will

145
00:01:33,506 --> 00:01:37,256
I remember my

146
00:01:37,256 --> 00:01:41,006
covenant which I

147
00:01:41,006 --> 00:01:44,756
have made unto

148
00:01:44,756 --> 00:01:48,506
my people, O

149
00:01:48,506 --> 00:01:52,256
house of Israel, and

150
00:01:52,256 --> 00:01:56,006
I will bring my

151
00:01:56,006 --> 00:01:59,987
gospel unto them.

152
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:00,487
12 And I will

153
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:00,987
show unto thee, O

154
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:01,487
house of Israel,

155
00:02:01,487 --> 00:02:01,987
that the

156
00:02:01,987 --> 00:02:02,487
Gentiles shall not

157
00:02:02,487 --> 00:02:02,987
have power over

158
00:02:02,987 --> 00:02:03,487
you; but I will

159
00:02:03,487 --> 00:02:03,987
remember my

160
00:02:03,987 --> 00:02:04,487
covenant unto you, O

161
00:02:04,487 --> 00:02:04,987
house of Israel,

162
00:02:04,987 --> 00:02:05,487
and ye shall come

163
00:02:05,487 --> 00:02:05,987
unto the

164
00:02:05,987 --> 00:02:06,487
knowledge of the

165
00:02:06,487 --> 00:02:06,994
fulness of my gospel.

166
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:08,661
13 But if the

167
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:10,328
Gentiles will

168
00:02:10,328 --> 00:02:11,995
repent and return

169
00:02:11,995 --> 00:02:13,662
unto me, saith

170
00:02:13,662 --> 00:02:15,329
the Father,

171
00:02:15,329 --> 00:02:16,996
behold they shall

172
00:02:16,996 --> 00:02:18,663
be numbered

173
00:02:18,663 --> 00:02:20,33
among my people,

174
00:02:20,33 --> 00:02:21,274
O house of Israel.

175
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:23,274
14 And I will

176
00:02:23,274 --> 00:02:25,274
not suffer my

177
00:02:25,274 --> 00:02:27,274
people, who

178
00:02:27,274 --> 00:02:29,274
are of the house

179
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,274
of Israel, to

180
00:02:31,274 --> 00:02:33,274
go through

181
00:02:33,274 --> 00:02:35,274
among them, and

182
00:02:35,274 --> 00:02:37,274
tread them

183
00:02:37,274 --> 00:02:39,593
down, saith the Father.

184
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:39,556
15 But if

185
00:02:39,556 --> 00:02:39,519
they will not

186
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:39,482
turn unto me,

187
00:02:39,482 --> 00:02:39,445
and hearken

188
00:02:39,445 --> 00:02:39,408
unto my voice,

189
00:02:39,408 --> 00:02:39,371
I will suffer

190
00:02:39,371 --> 00:02:39,334
them, yea, I

191
00:02:39,334 --> 00:02:39,297
will suffer

192
00:02:39,297 --> 00:02:39,26
my people, O

193
00:02:39,26 --> 00:02:39,223
house of

194
00:02:39,223 --> 00:02:39,186
Israel, that they

195
00:02:39,186 --> 00:02:39,149
shall go

196
00:02:39,149 --> 00:02:39,112
through among

197
00:02:39,112 --> 00:02:39,075
them, and shall

198
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:39,038
tread them

199
00:02:39,038 --> 00:02:39,001
down, and they

200
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:38,964
shall be as

201
00:02:38,964 --> 00:02:38,927
salt that

202
00:02:38,927 --> 00:02:38,89
hath lost its

203
00:02:38,89 --> 00:02:38,853
savor, which is

204
00:02:38,853 --> 00:02:38,816
thenceforth

205
00:02:38,816 --> 00:02:38,779
good for

206
00:02:38,779 --> 00:02:38,742
nothing but to be

207
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:38,705
cast out,

208
00:02:38,705 --> 00:02:38,668
and to be

209
00:02:38,668 --> 00:02:38,631
trodden under foot

210
00:02:38,631 --> 00:02:38,659
of my people, O house of Israel.

211
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:42,294
16 Verily,

212
00:02:42,294 --> 00:02:45,93
verily, I say

213
00:02:45,93 --> 00:02:49,567
unto you,

214
00:02:49,567 --> 00:02:53,203
thus hath the

215
00:02:53,203 --> 00:02:56,839
Father

216
00:02:56,839 --> 00:03:00,475
commanded

217
00:03:00,475 --> 00:03:04,111
me—that I should

218
00:03:04,111 --> 00:03:07,746
give unto

219
00:03:07,746 --> 00:03:11,382
this people

220
00:03:11,382 --> 00:03:15,019
this land for

221
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:18,965
their inheritance.

222
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,108
17 And

223
00:03:20,108 --> 00:03:21,251
then the

224
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:22,394
words of the

225
00:03:22,394 --> 00:03:23,537
prophet

226
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:24,68
Isaiah shall

227
00:03:24,68 --> 00:03:25,823
be

228
00:03:25,823 --> 00:03:26,006
fulfilled, which say:

229
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:27,473
18 Thy

230
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:28,94
watchmen

231
00:03:28,94 --> 00:03:30,407
shall lift

232
00:03:30,407 --> 00:03:31,874
up the

233
00:03:31,874 --> 00:03:33,341
voice; with

234
00:03:33,341 --> 00:03:34,808
the

235
00:03:34,808 --> 00:03:36,275
voice

236
00:03:36,275 --> 00:03:37,742
together shall

237
00:03:37,742 --> 00:03:39,209
they sing,

238
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:40,676
for they

239
00:03:40,676 --> 00:03:42,143
shall

240
00:03:42,143 --> 00:03:43,61
see eye to

241
00:03:43,61 --> 00:03:45,077
eye when

242
00:03:45,077 --> 00:03:46,544
the Lord

243
00:03:46,544 --> 00:03:48,261
shall bring again Zion.

244
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:49,199
19 Break

245
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,137
forth

246
00:03:50,137 --> 00:03:51,075
into joy,

247
00:03:51,075 --> 00:03:52,013
sing

248
00:03:52,013 --> 00:03:52,951
together,

249
00:03:52,951 --> 00:03:53,889
ye waste

250
00:03:53,889 --> 00:03:54,827
places

251
00:03:54,827 --> 00:03:55,765
of

252
00:03:55,765 --> 00:03:56,703
Jerusalem;

253
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:57,641
for the

254
00:03:57,641 --> 00:03:58,579
Lord hath

255
00:03:58,579 --> 00:03:59,517


256
00:03:59,517 --> 00:04:00,455
comforted his

257
00:04:00,455 --> 00:04:01,393
people, he

258
00:04:01,393 --> 00:04:02,331
hath

259
00:04:02,331 --> 00:04:03,744
redeemed Jerusalem.

260
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:03,919
20 The

261
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:04,096
Lord

262
00:04:04,096 --> 00:04:04,272
hath made

263
00:04:04,272 --> 00:04:04,448
bare

264
00:04:04,448 --> 00:04:04,624
his holy

265
00:04:04,624 --> 00:04:04,8
arm in

266
00:04:04,8 --> 00:04:04,976
the

267
00:04:04,976 --> 00:04:05,151
eyes of

268
00:04:05,151 --> 00:04:05,328
all the

269
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:05,504


270
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:05,68
nations; and

271
00:04:05,68 --> 00:04:05,856
all the

272
00:04:05,856 --> 00:04:06,032
ends of

273
00:04:06,032 --> 00:04:06,208
the

274
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:06,383
earth

275
00:04:06,383 --> 00:04:06,56
shall see

276
00:04:06,56 --> 00:04:06,146
the salvation of God.
