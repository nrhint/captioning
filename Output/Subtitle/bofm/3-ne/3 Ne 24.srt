00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:08,4
Chapter 24 The Lord’s messenger will

2
00:00:08,4 --> 00:00:16,8
prepare the way for the Second Coming—Christ will

3
00:00:16,8 --> 00:00:25,2
sit in judgment—Israel is commanded to pay

4
00:00:25,2 --> 00:00:33,6
tithes and offerings—A book of remembrance

5
00:00:33,6 --> 00:00:42,276
is kept—Compare 
Malachi 3. About A.D. 34. 

6
00:00:42,276 --> 00:00:45,661
1 And it came to pass that he commanded

7
00:00:45,661 --> 00:00:49,046
them that they should write the words which

8
00:00:49,046 --> 00:00:52,431
the Father had given unto Malachi, which

9
00:00:52,431 --> 00:00:55,816
he should tell unto them. And it came to

10
00:00:55,816 --> 00:00:59,201
pass that after they were written he

11
00:00:59,201 --> 00:01:02,586
expounded them. And these are the words which he

12
00:01:02,586 --> 00:01:05,971
did tell unto them, saying: Thus said the

13
00:01:05,971 --> 00:01:09,356
Father unto Malachi—Behold, I will send my

14
00:01:09,356 --> 00:01:12,741
messenger, and he shall prepare the way

15
00:01:12,741 --> 00:01:16,126
before me, and the Lord whom ye seek shall

16
00:01:16,126 --> 00:01:19,511
suddenly come to his temple, even the

17
00:01:19,511 --> 00:01:22,896
messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in;

18
00:01:22,896 --> 00:01:26,52
behold, he shall come, saith the Lord of Hosts.

19
00:01:26,52 --> 00:01:29,52
2 But who may abide the day of his

20
00:01:29,52 --> 00:01:32,52
coming, and who shall stand when

21
00:01:32,52 --> 00:01:35,52
he appeareth? For he is like a

22
00:01:35,52 --> 00:01:38,865
refiner’s fire, and like fuller’s soap.

23
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:40,865
3 And he shall sit as a refiner

24
00:01:40,865 --> 00:01:42,865
and purifier of silver; and he

25
00:01:42,865 --> 00:01:44,865
shall purify the sons of Levi,

26
00:01:44,865 --> 00:01:46,865
and purge them as gold and silver,

27
00:01:46,865 --> 00:01:48,865
that they may offer unto the

28
00:01:48,865 --> 00:01:50,31
Lord an offering in righteousness.

29
00:01:50,31 --> 00:01:51,56
4 Then shall the offering of

30
00:01:51,56 --> 00:01:52,81
Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant

31
00:01:52,81 --> 00:01:54,06
unto the Lord, as in the days

32
00:01:54,06 --> 00:01:55,716
of old, and as in former years.

33
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:56,716
5 And I will come near to

34
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:57,716
you to judgment; and I will be

35
00:01:57,716 --> 00:01:58,716
a swift witness against the

36
00:01:58,716 --> 00:01:59,716
sorcerers, and against the

37
00:01:59,716 --> 00:02:00,716
adulterers, and against

38
00:02:00,716 --> 00:02:01,716
false swearers, and against

39
00:02:01,716 --> 00:02:02,716
those that oppress the hireling

40
00:02:02,716 --> 00:02:03,716
in his wages, the widow and

41
00:02:03,716 --> 00:02:04,716
the fatherless, and that

42
00:02:04,716 --> 00:02:05,716
turn aside the stranger, and

43
00:02:05,716 --> 00:02:06,093
fear not me, saith the Lord of Hosts.

44
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:11,093
6 For I am the Lord, I

45
00:02:11,093 --> 00:02:16,093
change not; therefore ye sons

46
00:02:16,093 --> 00:02:21,575
of Jacob are not consumed.

47
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:22,075
7 Even from the days of

48
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:22,575
your fathers ye are gone

49
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:23,075
away from mine ordinances,

50
00:02:23,075 --> 00:02:23,575
and have not kept them.

51
00:02:23,575 --> 00:02:24,075
Return unto me and I will

52
00:02:24,075 --> 00:02:24,575
return unto you, saith

53
00:02:24,575 --> 00:02:25,075
the Lord of Hosts. But ye

54
00:02:25,075 --> 00:02:25,979
say: Wherein shall we return?

55
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,579
8 Will a man rob God?

56
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:31,179
Yet ye have robbed me.

57
00:02:31,179 --> 00:02:33,779
But ye say: Wherein

58
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:36,379
have we robbed thee? In

59
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:38,325
tithes and offerings.

60
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:38,325
9 Ye are cursed

61
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:38,325
with a curse, for ye

62
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:38,325
have robbed me, even

63
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:38,792
this whole nation.

64
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:39,221
10 Bring ye all

65
00:02:39,221 --> 00:02:39,65
the tithes into the

66
00:02:39,65 --> 00:02:40,079
storehouse, that

67
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:40,508
there may be meat

68
00:02:40,508 --> 00:02:40,937
in my house; and

69
00:02:40,937 --> 00:02:41,366
prove me now

70
00:02:41,366 --> 00:02:41,795
herewith, saith the Lord

71
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:42,224
of Hosts, if I

72
00:02:42,224 --> 00:02:42,653
will not open you the

73
00:02:42,653 --> 00:02:43,082
windows of

74
00:02:43,082 --> 00:02:43,511
heaven, and pour you out

75
00:02:43,511 --> 00:02:43,94
a blessing that

76
00:02:43,94 --> 00:02:44,369
there shall not be

77
00:02:44,369 --> 00:02:44,197
room enough to receive it.

78
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:45,015
11 And I will

79
00:02:45,015 --> 00:02:45,833
rebuke the devourer

80
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:46,651
for your sakes,

81
00:02:46,651 --> 00:02:47,469
and he shall not

82
00:02:47,469 --> 00:02:48,287
destroy the fruits

83
00:02:48,287 --> 00:02:49,105
of your ground;

84
00:02:49,105 --> 00:02:49,923
neither shall

85
00:02:49,923 --> 00:02:50,741
your vine cast her

86
00:02:50,741 --> 00:02:51,559
fruit before the

87
00:02:51,559 --> 00:02:52,377
time in the

88
00:02:52,377 --> 00:02:53,64
fields, saith the Lord of Hosts.

89
00:02:53,64 --> 00:02:55,64
12 And all

90
00:02:55,64 --> 00:02:57,64
nations shall

91
00:02:57,64 --> 00:02:59,64
call you blessed,

92
00:02:59,64 --> 00:03:01,64
for ye shall

93
00:03:01,64 --> 00:03:03,64
be a

94
00:03:03,64 --> 00:03:05,64
delightsome land, saith

95
00:03:05,64 --> 00:03:07,954
the Lord of Hosts.

96
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:07,954
13 Your

97
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:07,954
words have been

98
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:07,954
stout

99
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:07,954
against me, saith

100
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:07,954
the Lord.

101
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:07,954
Yet ye say:

102
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:07,954
What have we

103
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:07,487
spoken against thee?

104
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
14 Ye have

105
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
said: It is

106
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
vain to

107
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
serve God,

108
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
and what doth

109
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
it profit

110
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
that we

111
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
have kept his

112
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
ordinances

113
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
and that we

114
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
have

115
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
walked

116
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
mournfully before

117
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,954
the Lord of Hosts?

118
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:07,954
15 And now

119
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:07,954
we call

120
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:07,954
the proud

121
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:07,954
happy; yea,

122
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:07,954
they that

123
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:07,954
work

124
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:07,954
wickedness are

125
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:07,954
set up;

126
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:07,954
yea, they

127
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:07,954
that tempt

128
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:07,954
God are

129
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:07,487
even delivered.

130
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
16 Then

131
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
they that

132
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
feared

133
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
the Lord

134
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
spake often

135
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
one to

136
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
another,

137
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
and the

138
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
Lord

139
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
hearkened and

140
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
heard; and

141
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
a book

142
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
of

143
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
remembrance was

144
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
written

145
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
before him

146
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
for them

147
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
that

148
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
feared the

149
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
Lord, and

150
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,954
that thought upon his name.

151
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:07,954
17 And

152
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:07,954
they

153
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:07,954
shall be

154
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:07,954
mine, saith

155
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:07,954
the

156
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:07,954
Lord of

157
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:07,954
Hosts, in

158
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:07,954
that day

159
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:07,954
when I

160
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:07,954
make up

161
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:07,954
my

162
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:07,954
jewels; and I

163
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:07,954
will

164
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:07,954
spare them

165
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:07,954
as a man

166
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:07,954
spareth

167
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:07,954
his own

168
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:07,487
son that serveth him.

169
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
18 Then

170
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
shall

171
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
ye

172
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
return and

173
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
discern

174
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487


175
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
between the

176
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487


177
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
righteous and

178
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
the

179
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
wicked,

180
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
between

181
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
him that

182
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
serveth

183
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
God

184
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,487
and him

185
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:07,954
that serveth him not.
