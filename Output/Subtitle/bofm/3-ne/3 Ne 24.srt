00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,4
Chapter 24 The Lord’s messenger will prepare the

2
00:00:01,4 --> 00:00:02,8
 way for the Second Coming—Christ will sit in

3
00:00:02,8 --> 00:00:04,2
 judgment—Israel is commanded to pay tithes and

4
00:00:04,2 --> 00:00:05,6
 offerings—A book of remembrance is kept—Compare 
Malachi 3.

5
00:00:05,6 --> 00:00:07,0
 About A.D. 34.

6
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:08,642
1 And it came to pass that he commanded them that

7
00:00:08,642 --> 00:00:09,309
 they should write the words which the Father had

8
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:09,976
 given unto Malachi, which he should tell unto them.

9
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:10,643
 And it came to pass that after they were written

10
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:11,31
 he expounded them. And these are the words which

11
00:00:11,31 --> 00:00:11,977
 he did tell unto them, saying: Thus said the Father

12
00:00:11,977 --> 00:00:12,644
 unto Malachi—Behold, I will send my messenger,

13
00:00:12,644 --> 00:00:13,311
 and he shall prepare the way before me, and the Lord

14
00:00:13,311 --> 00:00:13,978
 whom ye seek shall suddenly come to his temple,

15
00:00:13,978 --> 00:00:14,645
 even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight

16
00:00:14,645 --> 00:00:15,312
 in; behold, he shall come, saith the Lord of

17
00:00:15,312 --> 00:00:15,979
 Hosts

18
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,616
2 But who may abide the day of his coming, and who

19
00:00:18,616 --> 00:00:21,283
 shall stand when he appeareth? For he is like a

20
00:00:21,283 --> 00:00:23,95
 refiner’s fire, and like fuller’s soap

21
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:27,924
3 And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of

22
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:31,924
 silver; and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and

23
00:00:31,924 --> 00:00:35,924
 purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer

24
00:00:35,924 --> 00:00:39,924
 unto the Lord an offering in righteousness

25
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,54
4 Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem

26
00:00:42,54 --> 00:00:45,207
 be pleasant unto the Lord, as in the days of old,

27
00:00:45,207 --> 00:00:47,874
 and as in former years

28
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:48,991
5 And I will come near to you to judgment; and I

29
00:00:48,991 --> 00:00:50,134
 will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and

30
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:51,277
 against the adulterers, and against false

31
00:00:51,277 --> 00:00:52,42
 swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in

32
00:00:52,42 --> 00:00:53,563
 his wages, the widow and the fatherless, and that

33
00:00:53,563 --> 00:00:54,706
 turn aside the stranger, and fear not me, saith the

34
00:00:54,706 --> 00:00:55,849
 Lord of Hosts

35
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:59,822
6 For I am the Lord, I change not; therefore ye

36
00:00:59,822 --> 00:01:03,822
 sons of Jacob are not consumed

37
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,397
7 Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone

38
00:01:05,397 --> 00:01:06,997
 away from mine ordinances, and have not kept them.

39
00:01:06,997 --> 00:01:08,597
 Return unto me and I will return unto you, saith

40
00:01:08,597 --> 00:01:10,197
 the Lord of Hosts. But ye say: Wherein shall we

41
00:01:10,197 --> 00:01:11,797
 return

42
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:14,439
8 Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But

43
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:17,106
 ye say: Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and

44
00:01:17,106 --> 00:01:19,773
 offerings

45
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:27,746
9 Ye are cursed with a curse, for ye have robbed

46
00:01:27,746 --> 00:01:35,746
 me, even this whole nation

47
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,029
10 Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse,

48
00:01:37,029 --> 00:01:38,362
 that there may be meat in my house; and prove me now

49
00:01:38,362 --> 00:01:39,695
 herewith, saith the Lord of Hosts, if I will not

50
00:01:39,695 --> 00:01:41,028
 open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a

51
00:01:41,028 --> 00:01:42,361
 blessing that there shall not be room enough to

52
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:43,694
 receive it

53
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:45,67
11 And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes,

54
00:01:45,67 --> 00:01:47,67
 and he shall not destroy the fruits of your

55
00:01:47,67 --> 00:01:49,67
 ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before

56
00:01:49,67 --> 00:01:51,67
 the time in the fields, saith the Lord of Hosts

57
00:01:51,645 --> 00:02:04,978
12 And all nations shall call you blessed, for ye

58
00:02:04,978 --> 00:02:18,311
 shall be a delightsome land, saith the Lord of

59
00:02:18,311 --> 00:02:31,644
 Hosts

60
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:34,185
13 Your words have been stout against me, saith

61
00:02:34,185 --> 00:02:36,852
 the Lord. Yet ye say: What have we spoken against

62
00:02:36,852 --> 00:02:39,519
 thee

63
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:43,493
14 Ye have said: It is vain to serve God, and what

64
00:02:43,493 --> 00:02:47,493
 doth it profit that we have kept his ordinances

65
00:02:47,493 --> 00:02:51,493
 and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord

66
00:02:51,493 --> 00:02:55,493
 of Hosts

67
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:58,109
15 And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that

68
00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:00,776
 work wickedness are set up; yea, they that tempt

69
00:03:00,776 --> 00:03:03,443
 God are even delivered

70
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,017
16 Then they that feared the Lord spake often one

71
00:03:05,017 --> 00:03:06,617
 to another, and the Lord hearkened and heard; and

72
00:03:06,617 --> 00:03:08,217
 a book of remembrance was written before him for

73
00:03:08,217 --> 00:03:09,817
 them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon

74
00:03:09,817 --> 00:03:11,417
 his name

75
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,391
17 And they shall be mine, saith the Lord of

76
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:15,391
 Hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will

77
00:03:15,391 --> 00:03:17,391
 spare them as a man spareth his own son that

78
00:03:17,391 --> 00:03:19,391
 serveth him

79
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:19,699
18 Then shall ye return and discern between the

80
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,032
 righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth

81
00:03:20,032 --> 00:03:20,365
 God and him that serveth him not.
