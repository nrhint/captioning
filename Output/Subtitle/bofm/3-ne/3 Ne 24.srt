00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 24 The Lord’s messenger will

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
prepare the way for the Second Coming—Christ will

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
sit in judgment—Israel is commanded to pay

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
tithes and offerings—A book of remembrance

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:15:07,
is kept—Compare 
Malachi 3. About A.D. 34. 

6
00:15:07,0 --> 00:15:07,0
1 And it came to pass that he commanded

7
00:15:07,0 --> 00:15:07,0
them that they should write the words which

8
00:15:07,0 --> 00:15:07,0
the Father had given unto Malachi, which

9
00:15:07,0 --> 00:15:07,0
he should tell unto them. And it came to

10
00:15:07,0 --> 00:15:07,0
pass that after they were written he

11
00:15:07,0 --> 00:15:07,0
expounded them. And these are the words which he

12
00:15:07,0 --> 00:15:07,0
did tell unto them, saying: Thus said the

13
00:15:07,0 --> 00:15:07,0
Father unto Malachi—Behold, I will send my

14
00:15:07,0 --> 00:15:07,0
messenger, and he shall prepare the way

15
00:15:07,0 --> 00:15:07,0
before me, and the Lord whom ye seek shall

16
00:15:07,0 --> 00:15:07,0
suddenly come to his temple, even the

17
00:15:07,0 --> 00:15:07,0
messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in;

18
00:15:07,0 --> 00:18:52,
behold, he shall come, saith the Lord of Hosts.

19
00:18:52,0 --> 00:18:52,0
2 But who may abide the day of his

20
00:18:52,0 --> 00:18:52,0
coming, and who shall stand when

21
00:18:52,0 --> 00:18:52,0
he appeareth? For he is like a

22
00:18:52,0 --> 00:20:04,
refiner’s fire, and like fuller’s soap.

23
00:20:04,0 --> 00:20:04,0
3 And he shall sit as a refiner

24
00:20:04,0 --> 00:20:04,0
and purifier of silver; and he

25
00:20:04,0 --> 00:20:04,0
shall purify the sons of Levi,

26
00:20:04,0 --> 00:20:04,0
and purge them as gold and silver,

27
00:20:04,0 --> 00:20:04,0
that they may offer unto the

28
00:20:04,0 --> 00:22:16,
Lord an offering in righteousness.

29
00:22:16,0 --> 00:22:16,0
4 Then shall the offering of

30
00:22:16,0 --> 00:22:16,0
Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant

31
00:22:16,0 --> 00:22:16,0
unto the Lord, as in the days

32
00:22:16,0 --> 00:29:24,
of old, and as in former years.

33
00:29:24,0 --> 00:29:24,0
5 And I will come near to

34
00:29:24,0 --> 00:29:24,0
you to judgment; and I will be

35
00:29:24,0 --> 00:29:24,0
a swift witness against the

36
00:29:24,0 --> 00:29:24,0
sorcerers, and against the

37
00:29:24,0 --> 00:29:24,0
adulterers, and against

38
00:29:24,0 --> 00:29:24,0
false swearers, and against

39
00:29:24,0 --> 00:29:24,0
those that oppress the hireling

40
00:29:24,0 --> 00:29:24,0
in his wages, the widow and

41
00:29:24,0 --> 00:29:24,0
the fatherless, and that

42
00:29:24,0 --> 00:29:24,0
turn aside the stranger, and

43
00:29:24,0 --> 00:40:32,
fear not me, saith the Lord of Hosts.

44
00:40:32,0 --> 00:40:32,0
6 For I am the Lord, I

45
00:40:32,0 --> 00:40:32,0
change not; therefore ye sons

46
00:40:32,0 --> 00:42:30,
of Jacob are not consumed.

47
00:42:30,0 --> 00:42:30,0
7 Even from the days of

48
00:42:30,0 --> 00:42:30,0
your fathers ye are gone

49
00:42:30,0 --> 00:42:30,0
away from mine ordinances,

50
00:42:30,0 --> 00:42:30,0
and have not kept them.

51
00:42:30,0 --> 00:42:30,0
Return unto me and I will

52
00:42:30,0 --> 00:42:30,0
return unto you, saith

53
00:42:30,0 --> 00:42:30,0
the Lord of Hosts. But ye

54
00:42:30,0 --> 00:52:39,
say: Wherein shall we return?

55
00:52:39,0 --> 00:52:39,0
8 Will a man rob God?

56
00:52:39,0 --> 00:52:39,0
Yet ye have robbed me.

57
00:52:39,0 --> 00:52:39,0
But ye say: Wherein

58
00:52:39,0 --> 00:52:39,0
have we robbed thee? In

59
00:52:39,0 --> 00:56:10,
tithes and offerings.

60
00:56:10,0 --> 00:56:10,0
9 Ye are cursed

61
00:56:10,0 --> 00:56:10,0
with a curse, for ye

62
00:56:10,0 --> 00:56:10,0
have robbed me, even

63
00:56:10,0 --> 01:07:17,
this whole nation.

64
01:07:17,0 --> 01:07:17,0
10 Bring ye all

65
01:07:17,0 --> 01:07:17,0
the tithes into the

66
01:07:17,0 --> 01:07:17,0
storehouse, that

67
01:07:17,0 --> 01:07:17,0
there may be meat

68
01:07:17,0 --> 01:07:17,0
in my house; and

69
01:07:17,0 --> 01:07:17,0
prove me now

70
01:07:17,0 --> 01:07:17,0
herewith, saith the Lord

71
01:07:17,0 --> 01:07:17,0
of Hosts, if I

72
01:07:17,0 --> 01:07:17,0
will not open you the

73
01:07:17,0 --> 01:07:17,0
windows of

74
01:07:17,0 --> 01:07:17,0
heaven, and pour you out

75
01:07:17,0 --> 01:07:17,0
a blessing that

76
01:07:17,0 --> 01:07:17,0
there shall not be

77
01:07:17,0 --> 01:09:29,
room enough to receive it.

78
01:09:29,0 --> 01:09:29,0
11 And I will

79
01:09:29,0 --> 01:09:29,0
rebuke the devourer

80
01:09:29,0 --> 01:09:29,0
for your sakes,

81
01:09:29,0 --> 01:09:29,0
and he shall not

82
01:09:29,0 --> 01:09:29,0
destroy the fruits

83
01:09:29,0 --> 01:09:29,0
of your ground;

84
01:09:29,0 --> 01:09:29,0
neither shall

85
01:09:29,0 --> 01:09:29,0
your vine cast her

86
01:09:29,0 --> 01:09:29,0
fruit before the

87
01:09:29,0 --> 01:09:29,0
time in the

88
01:09:29,0 --> 01:22:37,
fields, saith the Lord of Hosts.

89
01:22:37,0 --> 01:22:37,0
12 And all

90
01:22:37,0 --> 01:22:37,0
nations shall

91
01:22:37,0 --> 01:22:37,0
call you blessed,

92
01:22:37,0 --> 01:22:37,0
for ye shall

93
01:22:37,0 --> 01:22:37,0
be a

94
01:22:37,0 --> 01:22:37,0
delightsome land, saith

95
01:22:37,0 --> 01:26:50,
the Lord of Hosts.

96
01:26:50,0 --> 01:26:50,0
13 Your

97
01:26:50,0 --> 01:26:50,0
words have been

98
01:26:50,0 --> 01:26:50,0
stout

99
01:26:50,0 --> 01:26:50,0
against me, saith

100
01:26:50,0 --> 01:26:50,0
the Lord.

101
01:26:50,0 --> 01:26:50,0
Yet ye say:

102
01:26:50,0 --> 01:26:50,0
What have we

103
01:26:50,0 --> 01:32:00,
spoken against thee?

104
01:32:00,0 --> 01:32:00,0
14 Ye have

105
01:32:00,0 --> 01:32:00,0
said: It is

106
01:32:00,0 --> 01:32:00,0
vain to

107
01:32:00,0 --> 01:32:00,0
serve God,

108
01:32:00,0 --> 01:32:00,0
and what doth

109
01:32:00,0 --> 01:32:00,0
it profit

110
01:32:00,0 --> 01:32:00,0
that we

111
01:32:00,0 --> 01:32:00,0
have kept his

112
01:32:00,0 --> 01:32:00,0
ordinances

113
01:32:00,0 --> 01:32:00,0
and that we

114
01:32:00,0 --> 01:32:00,0
have

115
01:32:00,0 --> 01:32:00,0
walked

116
01:32:00,0 --> 01:32:00,0
mournfully before

117
01:32:00,0 --> 01:31:32,
the Lord of Hosts?

118
01:31:32,0 --> 01:31:32,0
15 And now

119
01:31:32,0 --> 01:31:32,0
we call

120
01:31:32,0 --> 01:31:32,0
the proud

121
01:31:32,0 --> 01:31:32,0
happy; yea,

122
01:31:32,0 --> 01:31:32,0
they that

123
01:31:32,0 --> 01:31:32,0
work

124
01:31:32,0 --> 01:31:32,0
wickedness are

125
01:31:32,0 --> 01:31:32,0
set up;

126
01:31:32,0 --> 01:31:32,0
yea, they

127
01:31:32,0 --> 01:31:32,0
that tempt

128
01:31:32,0 --> 01:31:32,0
God are

129
01:31:32,0 --> 01:35:17,
even delivered.

130
01:35:17,0 --> 01:35:17,0
16 Then

131
01:35:17,0 --> 01:35:17,0
they that

132
01:35:17,0 --> 01:35:17,0
feared

133
01:35:17,0 --> 01:35:17,0
the Lord

134
01:35:17,0 --> 01:35:17,0
spake often

135
01:35:17,0 --> 01:35:17,0
one to

136
01:35:17,0 --> 01:35:17,0
another,

137
01:35:17,0 --> 01:35:17,0
and the

138
01:35:17,0 --> 01:35:17,0
Lord

139
01:35:17,0 --> 01:35:17,0
hearkened and

140
01:35:17,0 --> 01:35:17,0
heard; and

141
01:35:17,0 --> 01:35:17,0
a book

142
01:35:17,0 --> 01:35:17,0
of

143
01:35:17,0 --> 01:35:17,0
remembrance was

144
01:35:17,0 --> 01:35:17,0
written

145
01:35:17,0 --> 01:35:17,0
before him

146
01:35:17,0 --> 01:35:17,0
for them

147
01:35:17,0 --> 01:35:17,0
that

148
01:35:17,0 --> 01:35:17,0
feared the

149
01:35:17,0 --> 01:35:17,0
Lord, and

150
01:35:17,0 --> 02:05:52,
that thought upon his name.

151
02:05:52,0 --> 02:05:52,0
17 And

152
02:05:52,0 --> 02:05:52,0
they

153
02:05:52,0 --> 02:05:52,0
shall be

154
02:05:52,0 --> 02:05:52,0
mine, saith

155
02:05:52,0 --> 02:05:52,0
the

156
02:05:52,0 --> 02:05:52,0
Lord of

157
02:05:52,0 --> 02:05:52,0
Hosts, in

158
02:05:52,0 --> 02:05:52,0
that day

159
02:05:52,0 --> 02:05:52,0
when I

160
02:05:52,0 --> 02:05:52,0
make up

161
02:05:52,0 --> 02:05:52,0
my

162
02:05:52,0 --> 02:05:52,0
jewels; and I

163
02:05:52,0 --> 02:05:52,0
will

164
02:05:52,0 --> 02:05:52,0
spare them

165
02:05:52,0 --> 02:05:52,0
as a man

166
02:05:52,0 --> 02:05:52,0
spareth

167
02:05:52,0 --> 02:05:52,0
his own

168
02:05:52,0 --> 02:09:22,
son that serveth him.

169
02:09:22,0 --> 02:09:22,0
18 Then

170
02:09:22,0 --> 02:09:22,0
shall

171
02:09:22,0 --> 02:09:22,0
ye

172
02:09:22,0 --> 02:09:22,0
return and

173
02:09:22,0 --> 02:09:22,0
discern

174
02:09:22,0 --> 02:09:22,0


175
02:09:22,0 --> 02:09:22,0
between the

176
02:09:22,0 --> 02:09:22,0


177
02:09:22,0 --> 02:09:22,0
righteous and

178
02:09:22,0 --> 02:09:22,0
the

179
02:09:22,0 --> 02:09:22,0
wicked,

180
02:09:22,0 --> 02:09:22,0
between

181
02:09:22,0 --> 02:09:22,0
him that

182
02:09:22,0 --> 02:09:22,0
serveth

183
02:09:22,0 --> 02:09:22,0
God

184
02:09:22,0 --> 02:09:22,0
and him

185
02:09:22,0 --> 02:11:34,
that serveth him not.
