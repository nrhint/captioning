00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,75
Chapter 22 In the last days, Zion and her stakes

2
00:00:01,75 --> 00:00:03,5
 will be established, and Israel will be gathered in

3
00:00:03,5 --> 00:00:05,25
 mercy and tenderness—They will triumph—Compare

4
00:00:05,25 --> 00:00:07,0
Isaiah 54. About A.D. 34.

5
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,308
1 And then shall that which is written come to

6
00:00:09,308 --> 00:00:10,641
 pass: Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear; break

7
00:00:10,641 --> 00:00:11,974
 forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou that

8
00:00:11,974 --> 00:00:13,307
 didst not travail with child; for more are the

9
00:00:13,307 --> 00:00:14,64
 children of the desolate than the children of the married

10
00:00:14,64 --> 00:00:15,973
 wife, saith the Lord

11
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,616
2 Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them

12
00:00:18,616 --> 00:00:21,283
 stretch forth the curtains of thy habitations; spare

13
00:00:21,283 --> 00:00:23,95
 not, lengthen thy cords and strengthen thy stakes

14
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:26,591
3 For thou shalt break forth on the right hand and

15
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:29,258
 on the left, and thy seed shall inherit the

16
00:00:29,258 --> 00:00:31,925
 Gentiles and make the desolate cities to be inhabited

17
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:34,566
4 Fear not, for thou shalt not be ashamed; neither

18
00:00:34,566 --> 00:00:37,233
 be thou confounded, for thou shalt not be put to

19
00:00:37,233 --> 00:00:39,9
 shame; for thou shalt forget the shame of thy

20
00:00:39,9 --> 00:00:42,567
 youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy

21
00:00:42,567 --> 00:00:45,234
 youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy

22
00:00:45,234 --> 00:00:47,901
 widowhood any more

23
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:53,181
5 For thy maker, thy husband, the Lord of Hosts is

24
00:00:53,181 --> 00:00:58,514
 his name; and thy Redeemer, the Holy One of

25
00:00:58,514 --> 00:01:03,847
 Israel—the God of the whole earth shall he be called

26
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:06,464
6 For the Lord hath called thee as a woman

27
00:01:06,464 --> 00:01:09,131
 forsaken and grieved in spirit, and a wife of youth, when

28
00:01:09,131 --> 00:01:11,798
 thou wast refused, saith thy God

29
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:15,772
7 For a small moment have I forsaken thee, but

30
00:01:15,772 --> 00:01:19,772
 with great mercies will I gather thee

31
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,413
8 In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a

32
00:01:22,413 --> 00:01:25,08
 moment, but with everlasting kindness will I have

33
00:01:25,08 --> 00:01:27,747
 mercy on thee, saith the Lord thy Redeemer

34
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:29,721
9 For this, the waters of Noah unto me, for as I

35
00:01:29,721 --> 00:01:31,721
 have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more

36
00:01:31,721 --> 00:01:33,721
 go over the earth, so have I sworn that I would not

37
00:01:33,721 --> 00:01:35,721
 be wroth with thee

38
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:41,696
10 For the mountains shall depart and the hills be

39
00:01:41,696 --> 00:01:47,696
 removed, but my kindness shall not depart from

40
00:01:47,696 --> 00:01:53,696
 thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be

41
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:59,696
 removed, saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee

42
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:02,287
11 O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not

43
00:02:02,287 --> 00:02:04,954
 comforted! Behold, I will lay thy stones with fair

44
00:02:04,954 --> 00:02:07,621
 colors, and lay thy foundations with sapphires

45
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:12,927
12 And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy

46
00:02:12,927 --> 00:02:18,26
 gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of

47
00:02:18,26 --> 00:02:23,593
 pleasant stones

48
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:27,543
13 And all thy children shall be taught of the

49
00:02:27,543 --> 00:02:31,543
 Lord; and great shall be the peace of thy children

50
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,518
14 In righteousness shalt thou be established;

51
00:02:33,518 --> 00:02:35,518
 thou shalt be far from oppression for thou shalt not

52
00:02:35,518 --> 00:02:37,518
 fear, and from terror for it shall not come near

53
00:02:37,518 --> 00:02:39,518
 thee

54
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:42,16
15 Behold, they shall surely gather together

55
00:02:42,16 --> 00:02:44,827
 against thee, not by me; whosoever shall gather

56
00:02:44,827 --> 00:02:47,494
 together against thee shall fall for thy sake

57
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,467
16 Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth

58
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:51,467
 the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an

59
00:02:51,467 --> 00:02:53,467
 instrument for his work; and I have created the

60
00:02:53,467 --> 00:02:55,467
 waster to destroy

61
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:55,642
17 No weapon that is formed against thee shall

62
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:55,842
 prosper; and every tongue that shall revile against

63
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:56,042
 thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the

64
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:56,242
 heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their

65
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:56,442
 righteousness is of me, saith the Lord.
