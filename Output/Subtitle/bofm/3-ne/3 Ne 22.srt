1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 22 In the last days, Zion and her

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
stakes will be established, and Israel will

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
be gathered in mercy and tenderness—They

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:03:45,
will triumph—Compare 
Isaiah 54. About A.D. 34. 

5
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
1 And then shall that which is written

6
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
come to pass: Sing, O barren, thou

7
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
that didst not bear; break forth into

8
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst

9
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
not travail with child; for more are

10
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
the children of the desolate than the

11
00:03:45,0 --> 00:12:54,
children of the married wife, saith the Lord.

12
00:12:54,0 --> 00:12:54,0
2 Enlarge the place of thy tent, and

13
00:12:54,0 --> 00:12:54,0
let them stretch forth the curtains

14
00:12:54,0 --> 00:12:54,0
of thy habitations; spare not,

15
00:12:54,0 --> 00:18:05,
lengthen thy cords and strengthen thy stakes;

16
00:18:05,0 --> 00:18:05,0
3 For thou shalt break forth

17
00:18:05,0 --> 00:18:05,0
on the right hand and on the

18
00:18:05,0 --> 00:18:05,0
left, and thy seed shall

19
00:18:05,0 --> 00:18:05,0
inherit the Gentiles and make the

20
00:18:05,0 --> 00:20:17,
desolate cities to be inhabited.

21
00:20:17,0 --> 00:20:17,0
4 Fear not, for thou shalt

22
00:20:17,0 --> 00:20:17,0
not be ashamed; neither

23
00:20:17,0 --> 00:20:17,0
be thou confounded, for

24
00:20:17,0 --> 00:20:17,0
thou shalt not be put to

25
00:20:17,0 --> 00:20:17,0
shame; for thou shalt forget

26
00:20:17,0 --> 00:20:17,0
the shame of thy youth, and

27
00:20:17,0 --> 00:20:17,0
shalt not remember the

28
00:20:17,0 --> 00:20:17,0
reproach of thy youth, and

29
00:20:17,0 --> 00:20:17,0
shalt not remember the

30
00:20:17,0 --> 00:20:47,
reproach of thy widowhood any more.

31
00:20:47,0 --> 00:20:47,0
5 For thy maker, thy

32
00:20:47,0 --> 00:20:47,0
husband, the Lord of Hosts

33
00:20:47,0 --> 00:20:47,0
is his name; and thy

34
00:20:47,0 --> 00:20:47,0
Redeemer, the Holy One of

35
00:20:47,0 --> 00:20:47,0
Israel—the God of the

36
00:20:47,0 --> 00:23:57,
whole earth shall he be called.

37
00:23:57,0 --> 00:23:57,0
6 For the Lord hath

38
00:23:57,0 --> 00:23:57,0
called thee as a woman

39
00:23:57,0 --> 00:23:57,0
forsaken and grieved in

40
00:23:57,0 --> 00:23:57,0
spirit, and a wife of

41
00:23:57,0 --> 00:23:57,0
youth, when thou wast

42
00:23:57,0 --> 00:29:07,
refused, saith thy God.

43
00:29:07,0 --> 00:29:07,0
7 For a small moment

44
00:29:07,0 --> 00:29:07,0
have I forsaken thee,

45
00:29:07,0 --> 00:29:07,0
but with great

46
00:29:07,0 --> 00:28:39,
mercies will I gather thee.

47
00:28:39,0 --> 00:28:39,0
8 In a little wrath

48
00:28:39,0 --> 00:28:39,0
I hid my face from

49
00:28:39,0 --> 00:28:39,0
thee for a moment,

50
00:28:39,0 --> 00:28:39,0
but with everlasting

51
00:28:39,0 --> 00:28:39,0
kindness will I have

52
00:28:39,0 --> 00:28:39,0
mercy on thee, saith

53
00:28:39,0 --> 00:33:49,
the Lord thy Redeemer.

54
00:33:49,0 --> 00:33:49,0
9 For this, the

55
00:33:49,0 --> 00:33:49,0
waters of Noah unto

56
00:33:49,0 --> 00:33:49,0
me, for as I have

57
00:33:49,0 --> 00:33:49,0
sworn that the

58
00:33:49,0 --> 00:33:49,0
waters of Noah should

59
00:33:49,0 --> 00:33:49,0
no more go over

60
00:33:49,0 --> 00:33:49,0
the earth, so have

61
00:33:49,0 --> 00:33:49,0
I sworn that I

62
00:33:49,0 --> 00:36:59,
would not be wroth with thee.

63
00:36:59,0 --> 00:36:59,0
10 For the

64
00:36:59,0 --> 00:36:59,0
mountains shall depart

65
00:36:59,0 --> 00:36:59,0
and the hills be

66
00:36:59,0 --> 00:36:59,0
removed, but my

67
00:36:59,0 --> 00:36:59,0
kindness shall not

68
00:36:59,0 --> 00:36:59,0
depart from

69
00:36:59,0 --> 00:36:59,0
thee, neither shall

70
00:36:59,0 --> 00:36:59,0
the covenant of my

71
00:36:59,0 --> 00:36:59,0
peace be

72
00:36:59,0 --> 00:36:59,0
removed, saith the Lord

73
00:36:59,0 --> 00:36:31,
that hath mercy on thee.

74
00:36:31,0 --> 00:36:31,0
11 O thou

75
00:36:31,0 --> 00:36:31,0
afflicted, tossed with

76
00:36:31,0 --> 00:36:31,0
tempest, and

77
00:36:31,0 --> 00:36:31,0
not comforted!

78
00:36:31,0 --> 00:36:31,0
Behold, I will lay

79
00:36:31,0 --> 00:36:31,0
thy stones with

80
00:36:31,0 --> 00:36:31,0
fair colors, and

81
00:36:31,0 --> 00:36:31,0
lay thy

82
00:36:31,0 --> 00:36:45,
foundations with sapphires.

83
00:36:45,0 --> 00:36:45,0
12 And I will

84
00:36:45,0 --> 00:36:45,0
make thy windows

85
00:36:45,0 --> 00:36:45,0
of agates, and

86
00:36:45,0 --> 00:36:45,0
thy gates of

87
00:36:45,0 --> 00:36:45,0
carbuncles, and

88
00:36:45,0 --> 00:36:45,0
all thy borders

89
00:36:45,0 --> 00:36:17,
of pleasant stones.

90
00:36:17,0 --> 00:36:17,0
13 And all thy

91
00:36:17,0 --> 00:36:17,0
children

92
00:36:17,0 --> 00:36:17,0
shall be taught of

93
00:36:17,0 --> 00:36:17,0
the Lord; and

94
00:36:17,0 --> 00:36:17,0
great shall

95
00:36:17,0 --> 00:36:17,0
be the peace of

96
00:36:17,0 --> 00:37:29,
thy children.

97
00:37:29,0 --> 00:37:29,0
14 In

98
00:37:29,0 --> 00:37:29,0
righteousness shalt

99
00:37:29,0 --> 00:37:29,0
thou be

100
00:37:29,0 --> 00:37:29,0
established; thou

101
00:37:29,0 --> 00:37:29,0
shalt be far from

102
00:37:29,0 --> 00:37:29,0
oppression for

103
00:37:29,0 --> 00:37:29,0
thou shalt

104
00:37:29,0 --> 00:37:29,0
not fear, and

105
00:37:29,0 --> 00:37:29,0
from terror for

106
00:37:29,0 --> 00:37:29,0
it shall not

107
00:37:29,0 --> 00:37:01,
come near thee.

108
00:37:01,0 --> 00:37:01,0
15 Behold,

109
00:37:01,0 --> 00:37:01,0
they shall

110
00:37:01,0 --> 00:37:01,0
surely gather

111
00:37:01,0 --> 00:37:01,0
together against

112
00:37:01,0 --> 00:37:01,0
thee, not by

113
00:37:01,0 --> 00:37:01,0
me;

114
00:37:01,0 --> 00:37:01,0
whosoever shall

115
00:37:01,0 --> 00:37:01,0
gather together

116
00:37:01,0 --> 00:37:01,0
against thee

117
00:37:01,0 --> 00:36:33,
shall fall for thy sake.

118
00:36:33,0 --> 00:36:33,0
16 Behold, I

119
00:36:33,0 --> 00:36:33,0
have

120
00:36:33,0 --> 00:36:33,0
created the smith

121
00:36:33,0 --> 00:36:33,0
that bloweth

122
00:36:33,0 --> 00:36:33,0
the coals

123
00:36:33,0 --> 00:36:33,0
in the fire,

124
00:36:33,0 --> 00:36:33,0
and that

125
00:36:33,0 --> 00:36:33,0
bringeth forth

126
00:36:33,0 --> 00:36:33,0
an

127
00:36:33,0 --> 00:36:33,0
instrument for his

128
00:36:33,0 --> 00:36:33,0
work; and I

129
00:36:33,0 --> 00:36:33,0
have created

130
00:36:33,0 --> 00:36:47,
the waster to destroy.

131
00:36:47,0 --> 00:36:47,0
17 No

132
00:36:47,0 --> 00:36:47,0
weapon that is

133
00:36:47,0 --> 00:36:47,0
formed

134
00:36:47,0 --> 00:36:47,0
against thee

135
00:36:47,0 --> 00:36:47,0
shall prosper;

136
00:36:47,0 --> 00:36:47,0
and every

137
00:36:47,0 --> 00:36:47,0
tongue that

138
00:36:47,0 --> 00:36:47,0
shall

139
00:36:47,0 --> 00:36:47,0
revile against

140
00:36:47,0 --> 00:36:47,0
thee in

141
00:36:47,0 --> 00:36:47,0
judgment thou

142
00:36:47,0 --> 00:36:47,0
shalt

143
00:36:47,0 --> 00:36:47,0
condemn. This is

144
00:36:47,0 --> 00:36:47,0
the

145
00:36:47,0 --> 00:36:47,0
heritage of the

146
00:36:47,0 --> 00:36:47,0
servants of

147
00:36:47,0 --> 00:36:47,0
the Lord,

148
00:36:47,0 --> 00:36:47,0
and their

149
00:36:47,0 --> 00:36:47,0
righteousness

150
00:36:47,0 --> 00:36:19,
is of me, saith the Lord.
