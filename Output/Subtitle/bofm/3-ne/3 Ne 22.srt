1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:09,5
Chapter 22 In the last days, Zion and her

2
00:00:09,5 --> 00:00:19,0
stakes will be established, and Israel will

3
00:00:19,0 --> 00:00:28,5
be gathered in mercy and tenderness—They

4
00:00:28,5 --> 00:00:38,939
will triumph—Compare 
Isaiah 54. About A.D. 34. 

5
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:44,368
1 And then shall that which is written

6
00:00:44,368 --> 00:00:49,797
come to pass: Sing, O barren, thou

7
00:00:49,797 --> 00:00:55,226
that didst not bear; break forth into

8
00:00:55,226 --> 00:01:00,655
singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst

9
00:01:00,655 --> 00:01:06,084
not travail with child; for more are

10
00:01:06,084 --> 00:01:11,513
the children of the desolate than the

11
00:01:11,513 --> 00:01:16,243
children of the married wife, saith the Lord.

12
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:25,243
2 Enlarge the place of thy tent, and

13
00:01:25,243 --> 00:01:34,243
let them stretch forth the curtains

14
00:01:34,243 --> 00:01:43,243
of thy habitations; spare not,

15
00:01:43,243 --> 00:01:52,546
lengthen thy cords and strengthen thy stakes;

16
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:52,746
3 For thou shalt break forth

17
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:52,946
on the right hand and on the

18
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:53,146
left, and thy seed shall

19
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:53,346
inherit the Gentiles and make the

20
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:53,013
desolate cities to be inhabited.

21
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:53,013
4 Fear not, for thou shalt

22
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:53,013
not be ashamed; neither

23
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:53,013
be thou confounded, for

24
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:53,013
thou shalt not be put to

25
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:53,013
shame; for thou shalt forget

26
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:53,013
the shame of thy youth, and

27
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:53,013
shalt not remember the

28
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:53,013
reproach of thy youth, and

29
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:53,013
shalt not remember the

30
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:53,48
reproach of thy widowhood any more.

31
00:01:53,48 --> 00:01:57,48
5 For thy maker, thy

32
00:01:57,48 --> 00:02:01,48
husband, the Lord of Hosts

33
00:02:01,48 --> 00:02:05,48
is his name; and thy

34
00:02:05,48 --> 00:02:09,48
Redeemer, the Holy One of

35
00:02:09,48 --> 00:02:13,48
Israel—the God of the

36
00:02:13,48 --> 00:02:17,871
whole earth shall he be called.

37
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
6 For the Lord hath

38
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
called thee as a woman

39
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
forsaken and grieved in

40
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
spirit, and a wife of

41
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
youth, when thou wast

42
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
refused, saith thy God.

43
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
7 For a small moment

44
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
have I forsaken thee,

45
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
but with great

46
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
mercies will I gather thee.

47
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
8 In a little wrath

48
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
I hid my face from

49
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
thee for a moment,

50
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
but with everlasting

51
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
kindness will I have

52
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
mercy on thee, saith

53
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
the Lord thy Redeemer.

54
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
9 For this, the

55
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
waters of Noah unto

56
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
me, for as I have

57
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
sworn that the

58
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
waters of Noah should

59
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
no more go over

60
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
the earth, so have

61
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
I sworn that I

62
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
would not be wroth with thee.

63
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
10 For the

64
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
mountains shall depart

65
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
and the hills be

66
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
removed, but my

67
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
kindness shall not

68
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
depart from

69
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
thee, neither shall

70
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
the covenant of my

71
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
peace be

72
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
removed, saith the Lord

73
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
that hath mercy on thee.

74
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
11 O thou

75
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
afflicted, tossed with

76
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
tempest, and

77
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
not comforted!

78
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
Behold, I will lay

79
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
thy stones with

80
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
fair colors, and

81
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
lay thy

82
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
foundations with sapphires.

83
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
12 And I will

84
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
make thy windows

85
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
of agates, and

86
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
thy gates of

87
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
carbuncles, and

88
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
all thy borders

89
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
of pleasant stones.

90
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
13 And all thy

91
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
children

92
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
shall be taught of

93
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
the Lord; and

94
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
great shall

95
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
be the peace of

96
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
thy children.

97
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
14 In

98
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
righteousness shalt

99
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
thou be

100
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
established; thou

101
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
shalt be far from

102
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
oppression for

103
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
thou shalt

104
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
not fear, and

105
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
from terror for

106
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
it shall not

107
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
come near thee.

108
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
15 Behold,

109
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
they shall

110
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
surely gather

111
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
together against

112
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
thee, not by

113
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
me;

114
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
whosoever shall

115
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
gather together

116
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
against thee

117
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
shall fall for thy sake.

118
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
16 Behold, I

119
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
have

120
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
created the smith

121
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
that bloweth

122
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
the coals

123
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
in the fire,

124
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
and that

125
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
bringeth forth

126
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
an

127
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
instrument for his

128
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
work; and I

129
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
have created

130
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
the waster to destroy.

131
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
17 No

132
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
weapon that is

133
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
formed

134
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
against thee

135
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
shall prosper;

136
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
and every

137
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
tongue that

138
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
shall

139
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
revile against

140
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
thee in

141
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
judgment thou

142
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
shalt

143
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
condemn. This is

144
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
the

145
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
heritage of the

146
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
servants of

147
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
the Lord,

148
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
and their

149
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
righteousness

150
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:17,871
is of me, saith the Lord.
