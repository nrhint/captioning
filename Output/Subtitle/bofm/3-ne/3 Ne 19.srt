00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:02,5
Chapter 19 The twelve disciples minister unto the

2
00:00:02,5 --> 00:00:05,0
 people and pray for the Holy Ghost—The disciples

3
00:00:05,0 --> 00:00:07,5
 are baptized and receive the Holy Ghost and the

4
00:00:07,5 --> 00:00:10,0
 ministering of angels—Jesus prays using words that

5
00:00:10,0 --> 00:00:12,5
 cannot be written—He attests to the exceedingly

6
00:00:12,5 --> 00:00:15,0
 great faith of these Nephites. About A.D. 34.

7
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:19,949
1 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had

8
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:23,949
 ascended into heaven, the multitude did disperse, and

9
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:27,949
 every man did take his wife and his children and

10
00:00:27,949 --> 00:00:31,949
 did return to his own home

11
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,499
2 And it was noised abroad among the people

12
00:00:33,499 --> 00:00:35,099
 immediately, before it was yet dark, that the multitude

13
00:00:35,099 --> 00:00:36,699
 had seen Jesus, and that he had ministered unto

14
00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:38,299
 them, and that he would also show himself on the

15
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:39,899
 morrow unto the multitude

16
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,016
3 Yea, and even all the night it was noised abroad

17
00:00:41,016 --> 00:00:42,159
 concerning Jesus; and insomuch did they send

18
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:43,302
 forth unto the people that there were many, yea, an

19
00:00:43,302 --> 00:00:44,445
 exceedingly great number, did labor exceedingly all

20
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:45,588
 that night, that they might be on the morrow in

21
00:00:45,588 --> 00:00:46,731
 the place where Jesus should show himself unto the

22
00:00:46,731 --> 00:00:47,874
 multitude

23
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,448
4 And it came to pass that on the morrow, when the

24
00:00:49,448 --> 00:00:51,048
 multitude was gathered together, behold, Nephi

25
00:00:51,048 --> 00:00:52,648
 and his brother whom he had raised from the dead,

26
00:00:52,648 --> 00:00:54,248
 whose name was Timothy, and also his son, whose name

27
00:00:54,248 --> 00:00:55,848
 was Jonas, and also Mathoni, and Mathonihah, his

28
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:57,448
 brother, and Kumen, and Kumenonhi, and Jeremiah,

29
00:00:57,448 --> 00:00:59,048
 and Shemnon, and Jonas, and Zedekiah, and

30
00:00:59,048 --> 00:01:00,648
 Isaiah—now these were the names of the disciples whom Jesus

31
00:01:00,648 --> 00:01:02,248
 had chosen—and it came to pass that they went

32
00:01:02,248 --> 00:01:03,848
 forth and stood in the midst of the multitude

33
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:06,464
5 And behold, the multitude was so great that they

34
00:01:06,464 --> 00:01:09,131
 did cause that they should be separated into

35
00:01:09,131 --> 00:01:11,798
 twelve bodies

36
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:13,772
6 And the twelve did teach the multitude; and

37
00:01:13,772 --> 00:01:15,772
 behold, they did cause that the multitude should kneel

38
00:01:15,772 --> 00:01:17,772
 down upon the face of the earth, and should pray

39
00:01:17,772 --> 00:01:19,772
 unto the Father in the name of Jesus

40
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,413
7 And the disciples did pray unto the Father also

41
00:01:22,413 --> 00:01:25,08
 in the name of Jesus. And it came to pass that

42
00:01:25,08 --> 00:01:27,747
 they arose and ministered unto the people

43
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:29,721
8 And when they had ministered those same words

44
00:01:29,721 --> 00:01:31,721
 which Jesus had spoken—nothing varying from the

45
00:01:31,721 --> 00:01:33,721
 words which Jesus had spoken—behold, they knelt again

46
00:01:33,721 --> 00:01:35,721
 and prayed to the Father in the name of Jesus

47
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:38,363
9 And they did pray for that which they most

48
00:01:38,363 --> 00:01:41,03
 desired; and they desired that the Holy Ghost should be

49
00:01:41,03 --> 00:01:43,697
 given unto them

50
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:46,337
10 And when they had thus prayed they went down

51
00:01:46,337 --> 00:01:49,004
 unto the water’s edge, and the multitude followed

52
00:01:49,004 --> 00:01:51,671
 them

53
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:55,645
11 And it came to pass that Nephi went down into

54
00:01:55,645 --> 00:01:59,645
 the water and was baptized

55
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:04,953
12 And he came up out of the water and began to

56
00:02:04,953 --> 00:02:10,286
 baptize. And he baptized all those whom Jesus had

57
00:02:10,286 --> 00:02:15,619
 chosen

58
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:17,569
13 And it came to pass when they were all baptized

59
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:19,569
 and had come up out of the water, the Holy Ghost

60
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:21,569
 did fall upon them, and they were filled with the

61
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:23,569
 Holy Ghost and with fire

62
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,143
14 And behold, they were encircled about as if it

63
00:02:25,143 --> 00:02:26,743
 were by fire; and it came down from heaven, and

64
00:02:26,743 --> 00:02:28,343
 the multitude did witness it, and did bear record;

65
00:02:28,343 --> 00:02:29,943
 and angels did come down out of heaven and did

66
00:02:29,943 --> 00:02:31,543
 minister unto them

67
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:34,185
15 And it came to pass that while the angels were

68
00:02:34,185 --> 00:02:36,852
 ministering unto the disciples, behold, Jesus came

69
00:02:36,852 --> 00:02:39,519
 and stood in the midst and ministered unto them

70
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,493
16 And it came to pass that he spake unto the

71
00:02:41,493 --> 00:02:43,493
 multitude, and commanded them that they should kneel

72
00:02:43,493 --> 00:02:45,493
 down again upon the earth, and also that his

73
00:02:45,493 --> 00:02:47,493
 disciples should kneel down upon the earth

74
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:50,134
17 And it came to pass that when they had all

75
00:02:50,134 --> 00:02:52,801
 knelt down upon the earth, he commanded his disciples

76
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:55,468
 that they should pray

77
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:58,109
18 And behold, they began to pray; and they did

78
00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:00,776
 pray unto Jesus, calling him their Lord and their

79
00:03:00,776 --> 00:03:03,443
 God

80
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:06,084
19 And it came to pass that Jesus departed out of

81
00:03:06,084 --> 00:03:08,751
 the midst of them, and went a little way off from

82
00:03:08,751 --> 00:03:11,418
 them and bowed himself to the earth, and he said

83
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,391
20 Father, I thank thee that thou hast given the

84
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:15,391
 Holy Ghost unto these whom I have chosen; and it is

85
00:03:15,391 --> 00:03:17,391
 because of their belief in me that I have chosen

86
00:03:17,391 --> 00:03:19,391
 them out of the world

87
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:22,033
21 Father, I pray thee that thou wilt give the

88
00:03:22,033 --> 00:03:24,7
 Holy Ghost unto all them that shall believe in their

89
00:03:24,7 --> 00:03:27,367
 words

90
00:03:27,34 --> 00:03:28,94
22 Father, thou hast given them the Holy Ghost

91
00:03:28,94 --> 00:03:30,54
 because they believe in me; and thou seest that they

92
00:03:30,54 --> 00:03:32,14
 believe in me because thou hearest them, and they

93
00:03:32,14 --> 00:03:33,74
 pray unto me; and they pray unto me because I am

94
00:03:33,74 --> 00:03:35,34
 with them

95
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:36,915
23 And now Father, I pray unto thee for them, and

96
00:03:36,915 --> 00:03:38,515
 also for all those who shall believe on their

97
00:03:38,515 --> 00:03:40,115
 words, that they may believe in me, that I may be in

98
00:03:40,115 --> 00:03:41,715
 them as thou, Father, art in me, that we may be

99
00:03:41,715 --> 00:03:43,315
 one

100
00:03:43,29 --> 00:03:44,623
24 And it came to pass that when Jesus had thus

101
00:03:44,623 --> 00:03:45,956
 prayed unto the Father, he came unto his disciples,

102
00:03:45,956 --> 00:03:47,289
 and behold, they did still continue, without

103
00:03:47,289 --> 00:03:48,622
 ceasing, to pray unto him; and they did not multiply

104
00:03:48,622 --> 00:03:49,955
 many words, for it was given unto them what they

105
00:03:49,955 --> 00:03:51,288
 should pray, and they were filled with desire

106
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:52,264
25 And it came to pass that Jesus blessed them as

107
00:03:52,264 --> 00:03:53,264
 they did pray unto him; and his countenance did

108
00:03:53,264 --> 00:03:54,264
 smile upon them, and the light of his countenance

109
00:03:54,264 --> 00:03:55,264
 did shine upon them, and behold they were as white

110
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,264
 as the countenance and also the garments of Jesus;

111
00:03:56,264 --> 00:03:57,264
 and behold the whiteness thereof did exceed all

112
00:03:57,264 --> 00:03:58,264
 the whiteness, yea, even there could be nothing upon

113
00:03:58,264 --> 00:03:59,264
 earth so white as the whiteness thereof

114
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,239
26 And Jesus said unto them: Pray on; nevertheless

115
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:07,239
 they did not cease to pray

116
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:09,881
27 And he turned from them again, and went a

117
00:04:09,881 --> 00:04:12,548
 little way off and bowed himself to the earth; and he

118
00:04:12,548 --> 00:04:15,215
 prayed again unto the Father, saying

119
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,521
28 Father, I thank thee that thou hast purified

120
00:04:16,521 --> 00:04:17,854
 those whom I have chosen, because of their faith,

121
00:04:17,854 --> 00:04:19,187
 and I pray for them, and also for them who shall

122
00:04:19,187 --> 00:04:20,52
 believe on their words, that they may be purified in

123
00:04:20,52 --> 00:04:21,853
 me, through faith on their words, even as they are

124
00:04:21,853 --> 00:04:23,186
 purified in me

125
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:24,496
29 Father, I pray not for the world, but for those

126
00:04:24,496 --> 00:04:25,829
 whom thou hast given me out of the world, because

127
00:04:25,829 --> 00:04:27,162
 of their faith, that they may be purified in me,

128
00:04:27,162 --> 00:04:28,495
 that I may be in them as thou, Father, art in me,

129
00:04:28,495 --> 00:04:29,828
 that we may be one, that I may be glorified in

130
00:04:29,828 --> 00:04:31,161
 them

131
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:32,738
30 And when Jesus had spoken these words he came

132
00:04:32,738 --> 00:04:34,338
 again unto his disciples; and behold they did pray

133
00:04:34,338 --> 00:04:35,938
 steadfastly, without ceasing, unto him; and he did

134
00:04:35,938 --> 00:04:37,538
 smile upon them again; and behold they were

135
00:04:37,538 --> 00:04:39,138
 white, even as Jesus

136
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:51,112
31 And it came to pass that he went again a little

137
00:04:51,112 --> 00:05:03,112
 way off and prayed unto the Father

138
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,703
32 And tongue cannot speak the words which he

139
00:05:05,703 --> 00:05:08,37
 prayed, neither can be written by man the words which

140
00:05:08,37 --> 00:05:11,037
 he prayed

141
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:13,344
33 And the multitude did hear and do bear record;

142
00:05:13,344 --> 00:05:15,677
 and their hearts were open and they did understand

143
00:05:15,677 --> 00:05:18,01
 in their hearts the words which he prayed

144
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:24,318
34 Nevertheless, so great and marvelous were the

145
00:05:24,318 --> 00:05:29,651
 words which he prayed that they cannot be written,

146
00:05:29,651 --> 00:05:34,984
 neither can they be uttered by man

147
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:36,268
35 And it came to pass that when Jesus had made an

148
00:05:36,268 --> 00:05:37,601
 end of praying he came again to the disciples,

149
00:05:37,601 --> 00:05:38,934
 and said unto them: So great faith have I never seen

150
00:05:38,934 --> 00:05:40,267
 among all the Jews; wherefore I could not show

151
00:05:40,267 --> 00:05:41,6
 unto them so great miracles, because of their

152
00:05:41,6 --> 00:05:42,933
 unbelief

153
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:43,909
36 Verily I say unto you, there are none of them

154
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:44,909
 that have seen so great things as ye have seen;

155
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:45,909
 neither have they heard so great things as ye have

156
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:46,909
 heard.
