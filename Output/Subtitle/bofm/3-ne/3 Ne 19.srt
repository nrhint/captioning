00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 19 The twelve disciples minister unto

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the people and pray for the Holy Ghost—The

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
disciples are baptized and receive the Holy Ghost and

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the ministering of angels—Jesus prays using words

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
that cannot be written—He attests to the

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:10:39,
exceedingly great faith of these Nephites. About A.D. 34. 

7
00:10:39,0 --> 00:10:39,0
1 And now it came to pass that when Jesus

8
00:10:39,0 --> 00:10:39,0
had ascended into heaven, the multitude did

9
00:10:39,0 --> 00:10:39,0
disperse, and every man did take his wife and

10
00:10:39,0 --> 00:16:49,
his children and did return to his own home.

11
00:16:49,0 --> 00:16:49,0
2 And it was noised abroad among the

12
00:16:49,0 --> 00:16:49,0
people immediately, before it was yet

13
00:16:49,0 --> 00:16:49,0
dark, that the multitude had seen

14
00:16:49,0 --> 00:16:49,0
Jesus, and that he had ministered unto

15
00:16:49,0 --> 00:16:49,0
them, and that he would also show

16
00:16:49,0 --> 00:20:48,
himself on the morrow unto the multitude.

17
00:20:48,0 --> 00:20:48,0
3 Yea, and even all the night it

18
00:20:48,0 --> 00:20:48,0
was noised abroad concerning Jesus;

19
00:20:48,0 --> 00:20:48,0
and insomuch did they send forth

20
00:20:48,0 --> 00:20:48,0
unto the people that there were

21
00:20:48,0 --> 00:20:48,0
many, yea, an exceedingly great

22
00:20:48,0 --> 00:20:48,0
number, did labor exceedingly all that

23
00:20:48,0 --> 00:20:48,0
night, that they might be on the

24
00:20:48,0 --> 00:20:48,0
morrow in the place where Jesus

25
00:20:48,0 --> 00:22:00,
should show himself unto the multitude.

26
00:22:00,0 --> 00:22:00,0
4 And it came to pass that on

27
00:22:00,0 --> 00:22:00,0
the morrow, when the multitude was

28
00:22:00,0 --> 00:22:00,0
gathered together, behold,

29
00:22:00,0 --> 00:22:00,0
Nephi and his brother whom he had

30
00:22:00,0 --> 00:22:00,0
raised from the dead, whose name

31
00:22:00,0 --> 00:22:00,0
was Timothy, and also his son,

32
00:22:00,0 --> 00:22:00,0
whose name was Jonas, and also

33
00:22:00,0 --> 00:22:00,0
Mathoni, and Mathonihah, his

34
00:22:00,0 --> 00:22:00,0
brother, and Kumen, and Kumenonhi, and

35
00:22:00,0 --> 00:22:00,0
Jeremiah, and Shemnon, and

36
00:22:00,0 --> 00:22:00,0
Jonas, and Zedekiah, and Isaiah—now

37
00:22:00,0 --> 00:22:00,0
these were the names of the

38
00:22:00,0 --> 00:22:00,0
disciples whom Jesus had chosen—and

39
00:22:00,0 --> 00:22:00,0
it came to pass that they went

40
00:22:00,0 --> 00:23:12,
forth and stood in the midst of the multitude.

41
00:23:12,0 --> 00:23:12,0
5 And behold, the multitude

42
00:23:12,0 --> 00:23:12,0
was so great that they did

43
00:23:12,0 --> 00:23:12,0
cause that they should be

44
00:23:12,0 --> 00:29:23,
separated into twelve bodies.

45
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
6 And the twelve did teach

46
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
the multitude; and

47
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
behold, they did cause that the

48
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
multitude should kneel

49
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
down upon the face of the

50
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
earth, and should pray unto

51
00:29:23,0 --> 00:34:34,
the Father in the name of Jesus.

52
00:34:34,0 --> 00:34:34,0
7 And the disciples did

53
00:34:34,0 --> 00:34:34,0
pray unto the Father

54
00:34:34,0 --> 00:34:34,0
also in the name of

55
00:34:34,0 --> 00:34:34,0
Jesus. And it came to pass

56
00:34:34,0 --> 00:34:34,0
that they arose and

57
00:34:34,0 --> 00:47:42,
ministered unto the people.

58
00:47:42,0 --> 00:47:42,0
8 And when they had

59
00:47:42,0 --> 00:47:42,0
ministered those same

60
00:47:42,0 --> 00:47:42,0
words which Jesus had

61
00:47:42,0 --> 00:47:42,0
spoken—nothing

62
00:47:42,0 --> 00:47:42,0
varying from the words

63
00:47:42,0 --> 00:47:42,0
which Jesus had

64
00:47:42,0 --> 00:47:42,0
spoken—behold, they knelt

65
00:47:42,0 --> 00:47:42,0
again and prayed to the

66
00:47:42,0 --> 00:57:51,
Father in the name of Jesus.

67
00:57:51,0 --> 00:57:51,0
9 And they did pray

68
00:57:51,0 --> 00:57:51,0
for that which

69
00:57:51,0 --> 00:57:51,0
they most desired; and

70
00:57:51,0 --> 00:57:51,0
they desired that

71
00:57:51,0 --> 00:57:51,0
the Holy Ghost

72
00:57:51,0 --> 01:05:00,
should be given unto them.

73
01:05:00,0 --> 01:05:00,0
10 And when they

74
01:05:00,0 --> 01:05:00,0
had thus prayed

75
01:05:00,0 --> 01:05:00,0
they went down

76
01:05:00,0 --> 01:05:00,0
unto the water’s

77
01:05:00,0 --> 01:05:00,0
edge, and the

78
01:05:00,0 --> 01:09:12,
multitude followed them.

79
01:09:12,0 --> 01:09:12,0
11 And it came

80
01:09:12,0 --> 01:09:12,0
to pass that

81
01:09:12,0 --> 01:09:12,0
Nephi went down

82
01:09:12,0 --> 01:09:12,0
into the water

83
01:09:12,0 --> 01:08:44,
and was baptized.

84
01:08:44,0 --> 01:08:44,0
12 And he came

85
01:08:44,0 --> 01:08:44,0
up out of the

86
01:08:44,0 --> 01:08:44,0
water and began

87
01:08:44,0 --> 01:08:44,0
to baptize. And

88
01:08:44,0 --> 01:08:44,0
he baptized

89
01:08:44,0 --> 01:08:44,0
all those whom

90
01:08:44,0 --> 01:11:40,
Jesus had chosen.

91
01:11:40,0 --> 01:11:40,0
13 And it came

92
01:11:40,0 --> 01:11:40,0
to pass when

93
01:11:40,0 --> 01:11:40,0
they were all

94
01:11:40,0 --> 01:11:40,0
baptized and

95
01:11:40,0 --> 01:11:40,0
had come up out

96
01:11:40,0 --> 01:11:40,0
of the water,

97
01:11:40,0 --> 01:11:40,0
the Holy

98
01:11:40,0 --> 01:11:40,0
Ghost did fall

99
01:11:40,0 --> 01:11:40,0
upon them, and

100
01:11:40,0 --> 01:11:40,0
they were filled

101
01:11:40,0 --> 01:11:40,0
with the Holy

102
01:11:40,0 --> 01:11:12,
Ghost and with fire.

103
01:11:12,0 --> 01:11:12,0
14 And

104
01:11:12,0 --> 01:11:12,0
behold, they were

105
01:11:12,0 --> 01:11:12,0
encircled

106
01:11:12,0 --> 01:11:12,0
about as if it

107
01:11:12,0 --> 01:11:12,0
were by fire;

108
01:11:12,0 --> 01:11:12,0
and it came

109
01:11:12,0 --> 01:11:12,0
down from

110
01:11:12,0 --> 01:11:12,0
heaven, and the

111
01:11:12,0 --> 01:11:12,0
multitude did

112
01:11:12,0 --> 01:11:12,0
witness it,

113
01:11:12,0 --> 01:11:12,0
and did bear

114
01:11:12,0 --> 01:11:12,0
record; and

115
01:11:12,0 --> 01:11:12,0
angels did come

116
01:11:12,0 --> 01:11:12,0
down out of

117
01:11:12,0 --> 01:11:12,0
heaven and did

118
01:11:12,0 --> 01:20:21,
minister unto them.

119
01:20:21,0 --> 01:20:21,0
15 And it

120
01:20:21,0 --> 01:20:21,0
came to pass

121
01:20:21,0 --> 01:20:21,0
that while

122
01:20:21,0 --> 01:20:21,0
the angels

123
01:20:21,0 --> 01:20:21,0
were

124
01:20:21,0 --> 01:20:21,0
ministering unto the

125
01:20:21,0 --> 01:20:21,0
disciples,

126
01:20:21,0 --> 01:20:21,0
behold, Jesus

127
01:20:21,0 --> 01:20:21,0
came and

128
01:20:21,0 --> 01:20:21,0
stood in the

129
01:20:21,0 --> 01:20:21,0
midst and

130
01:20:21,0 --> 01:30:30,
ministered unto them.

131
01:30:30,0 --> 01:30:30,0
16 And it

132
01:30:30,0 --> 01:30:30,0
came to pass

133
01:30:30,0 --> 01:30:30,0
that he

134
01:30:30,0 --> 01:30:30,0
spake unto

135
01:30:30,0 --> 01:30:30,0
the

136
01:30:30,0 --> 01:30:30,0
multitude, and

137
01:30:30,0 --> 01:30:30,0
commanded them

138
01:30:30,0 --> 01:30:30,0
that they

139
01:30:30,0 --> 01:30:30,0
should kneel

140
01:30:30,0 --> 01:30:30,0
down again

141
01:30:30,0 --> 01:30:30,0
upon the

142
01:30:30,0 --> 01:30:30,0
earth, and

143
01:30:30,0 --> 01:30:30,0
also that his

144
01:30:30,0 --> 01:30:30,0
disciples

145
01:30:30,0 --> 01:30:30,0
should

146
01:30:30,0 --> 01:30:02,
kneel down upon the earth.

147
01:30:02,0 --> 01:30:02,0
17 And it

148
01:30:02,0 --> 01:30:02,0
came to

149
01:30:02,0 --> 01:30:02,0
pass that

150
01:30:02,0 --> 01:30:02,0
when they

151
01:30:02,0 --> 01:30:02,0
had all

152
01:30:02,0 --> 01:30:02,0
knelt down

153
01:30:02,0 --> 01:30:02,0
upon the

154
01:30:02,0 --> 01:30:02,0
earth, he

155
01:30:02,0 --> 01:30:02,0
commanded his

156
01:30:02,0 --> 01:30:02,0
disciples

157
01:30:02,0 --> 01:30:02,0
that they

158
01:30:02,0 --> 01:33:47,
should pray.

159
01:33:47,0 --> 01:33:47,0
18 And

160
01:33:47,0 --> 01:33:47,0
behold,

161
01:33:47,0 --> 01:33:47,0
they began

162
01:33:47,0 --> 01:33:47,0
to pray;

163
01:33:47,0 --> 01:33:47,0
and they

164
01:33:47,0 --> 01:33:47,0
did pray

165
01:33:47,0 --> 01:33:47,0
unto

166
01:33:47,0 --> 01:33:47,0
Jesus, calling

167
01:33:47,0 --> 01:33:47,0
him

168
01:33:47,0 --> 01:33:47,0
their Lord

169
01:33:47,0 --> 01:38:58,
and their God.

170
01:38:58,0 --> 01:38:58,0
19 And

171
01:38:58,0 --> 01:38:58,0
it came

172
01:38:58,0 --> 01:38:58,0
to pass

173
01:38:58,0 --> 01:38:58,0
that

174
01:38:58,0 --> 01:38:58,0
Jesus

175
01:38:58,0 --> 01:38:58,0
departed out

176
01:38:58,0 --> 01:38:58,0
of the

177
01:38:58,0 --> 01:38:58,0
midst of

178
01:38:58,0 --> 01:38:58,0
them, and

179
01:38:58,0 --> 01:38:58,0
went a

180
01:38:58,0 --> 01:38:58,0
little

181
01:38:58,0 --> 01:38:58,0
way off

182
01:38:58,0 --> 01:38:58,0
from them

183
01:38:58,0 --> 01:38:58,0
and

184
01:38:58,0 --> 01:38:58,0
bowed

185
01:38:58,0 --> 01:38:58,0
himself to

186
01:38:58,0 --> 01:41:26,
the earth, and he said:

187
01:41:26,0 --> 01:41:26,0
20

188
01:41:26,0 --> 01:41:26,0
Father, I

189
01:41:26,0 --> 01:41:26,0
thank

190
01:41:26,0 --> 01:41:26,0
thee that

191
01:41:26,0 --> 01:41:26,0
thou

192
01:41:26,0 --> 01:41:26,0
hast

193
01:41:26,0 --> 01:41:26,0
given the

194
01:41:26,0 --> 01:41:26,0
Holy

195
01:41:26,0 --> 01:41:26,0
Ghost

196
01:41:26,0 --> 01:41:26,0
unto these

197
01:41:26,0 --> 01:41:26,0
whom I

198
01:41:26,0 --> 01:41:26,0
have

199
01:41:26,0 --> 01:41:26,0
chosen;

200
01:41:26,0 --> 01:41:26,0
and it

201
01:41:26,0 --> 01:41:26,0
is

202
01:41:26,0 --> 01:41:26,0
because of

203
01:41:26,0 --> 01:41:26,0
their

204
01:41:26,0 --> 01:41:26,0
belief

205
01:41:26,0 --> 01:41:26,0
in me

206
01:41:26,0 --> 01:41:26,0
that I

207
01:41:26,0 --> 01:41:26,0
have

208
01:41:26,0 --> 01:50:36,
chosen them out of the world.

209
01:50:36,0 --> 01:50:36,0
21

210
01:50:36,0 --> 01:50:36,0
Father, I

211
01:50:36,0 --> 01:50:36,0
pray

212
01:50:36,0 --> 01:50:36,0
thee

213
01:50:36,0 --> 01:50:36,0
that

214
01:50:36,0 --> 01:50:36,0
thou

215
01:50:36,0 --> 01:50:36,0
wilt give

216
01:50:36,0 --> 01:50:36,0
the

217
01:50:36,0 --> 01:50:36,0
Holy

218
01:50:36,0 --> 01:50:36,0
Ghost

219
01:50:36,0 --> 01:50:36,0
unto all

220
01:50:36,0 --> 01:50:36,0
them

221
01:50:36,0 --> 01:50:36,0
that

222
01:50:36,0 --> 01:50:36,0
shall

223
01:50:36,0 --> 01:50:36,0
believe

224
01:50:36,0 --> 01:59:46,
