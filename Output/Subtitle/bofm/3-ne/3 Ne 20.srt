00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,875
Chapter 20 Jesus provides bread and wine

2
00:00:00,875 --> 00:00:01,75
 miraculously and again administers the sacrament unto the

3
00:00:01,75 --> 00:00:02,625
 people—The remnant of Jacob will come to the

4
00:00:02,625 --> 00:00:03,5
 knowledge of the Lord their God and will inherit the

5
00:00:03,5 --> 00:00:04,375
 Americas—Jesus is the prophet like unto Moses, and

6
00:00:04,375 --> 00:00:05,25
 the Nephites are children of the prophets—Others of

7
00:00:05,25 --> 00:00:06,125
 the Lord’s people will be gathered to Jerusalem.

8
00:00:06,125 --> 00:00:07,0
 About A.D. 34.

9
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,975
1 And it came to pass that he commanded the

10
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:11,975
 multitude that they should cease to pray, and also his

11
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:13,975
 disciples. And he commanded them that they should

12
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:15,975
 not cease to pray in their hearts

13
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,616
2 And he commanded them that they should arise and

14
00:00:18,616 --> 00:00:21,283
 stand up upon their feet. And they arose up and

15
00:00:21,283 --> 00:00:23,95
 stood upon their feet

16
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:27,924
3 And it came to pass that he brake bread again

17
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:31,924
 and blessed it, and gave to the disciples to eat

18
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:34,566
4 And when they had eaten he commanded them that

19
00:00:34,566 --> 00:00:37,233
 they should break bread, and give unto the

20
00:00:37,233 --> 00:00:39,9
 multitude

21
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,54
5 And when they had given unto the multitude he

22
00:00:42,54 --> 00:00:45,207
 also gave them wine to drink, and commanded them

23
00:00:45,207 --> 00:00:47,874
 that they should give unto the multitude

24
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:51,848
6 Now, there had been no bread, neither wine,

25
00:00:51,848 --> 00:00:55,848
 brought by the disciples, neither by the multitude

26
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:59,822
7 But he truly gave unto them bread to eat, and

27
00:00:59,822 --> 00:01:03,822
 also wine to drink

28
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,397
8 And he said unto them: He that eateth this bread

29
00:01:05,397 --> 00:01:06,997
 eateth of my body to his soul; and he that

30
00:01:06,997 --> 00:01:08,597
 drinketh of this wine drinketh of my blood to his soul;

31
00:01:08,597 --> 00:01:10,197
 and his soul shall never hunger nor thirst, but

32
00:01:10,197 --> 00:01:11,797
 shall be filled

33
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:13,772
9 Now, when the multitude had all eaten and drunk,

34
00:01:13,772 --> 00:01:15,772
 behold, they were filled with the Spirit; and

35
00:01:15,772 --> 00:01:17,772
 they did cry out with one voice, and gave glory to

36
00:01:17,772 --> 00:01:19,772
 Jesus, whom they both saw and heard

37
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,346
10 And it came to pass that when they had all

38
00:01:21,346 --> 00:01:22,946
 given glory unto Jesus, he said unto them: Behold now

39
00:01:22,946 --> 00:01:24,546
 I finish the commandment which the Father hath

40
00:01:24,546 --> 00:01:26,146
 commanded me concerning this people, who are a

41
00:01:26,146 --> 00:01:27,746
 remnant of the house of Israel

42
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:29,721
11 Ye remember that I spake unto you, and said

43
00:01:29,721 --> 00:01:31,721
 that when the words of Isaiah should be

44
00:01:31,721 --> 00:01:33,721
 fulfilled—behold they are written, ye have them before you,

45
00:01:33,721 --> 00:01:35,721
 therefore search them

46
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:39,696
12 And verily, verily, I say unto you, that when

47
00:01:39,696 --> 00:01:43,696
 they shall be fulfilled then is the fulfilling of

48
00:01:43,696 --> 00:01:47,696
 the covenant which the Father hath made unto his

49
00:01:47,696 --> 00:01:51,696
 people, O house of Israel

50
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:52,978
13 And then shall the remnants, which shall be

51
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:54,311
 scattered abroad upon the face of the earth, be

52
00:01:54,311 --> 00:01:55,644
 gathered in from the east and from the west, and from

53
00:01:55,644 --> 00:01:56,977
 the south and from the north; and they shall be

54
00:01:56,977 --> 00:01:58,31
 brought to the knowledge of the Lord their God, who

55
00:01:58,31 --> 00:01:59,643
 hath redeemed them

56
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:03,62
14 And the Father hath commanded me that I should

57
00:02:03,62 --> 00:02:07,62
 give unto you this land, for your inheritance

58
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:10,261
15 And I say unto you, that if the Gentiles do not

59
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:12,928
 repent after the blessing which they shall

60
00:02:12,928 --> 00:02:15,595
 receive, after they have scattered my people

61
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:18,998
16 Then shall ye, who are a remnant of the house

62
00:02:18,998 --> 00:02:22,427
 of Jacob, go forth among them; and ye shall be in

63
00:02:22,427 --> 00:02:25,856
 the midst of them who shall be many; and ye shall

64
00:02:25,856 --> 00:02:29,285
 be among them as a lion among the beasts of the

65
00:02:29,285 --> 00:02:32,714
 forest, and as a young lion among the flocks of

66
00:02:32,714 --> 00:02:36,143
 sheep, who, if he goeth through both treadeth down and

67
00:02:36,143 --> 00:02:39,572
 teareth in pieces, and none can deliver

68
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:47,493
17 Thy hand shall be lifted up upon thine

69
00:02:47,493 --> 00:02:55,493
 adversaries, and all thine enemies shall be cut off

70
00:02:55,442 --> 00:03:19,442
18 And I will gather my people together as a man

71
00:03:19,442 --> 00:03:43,442
 gathereth his sheaves into the floor

72
00:03:43,29 --> 00:03:44,433
19 For I will make my people with whom the Father

73
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:45,576
 hath covenanted, yea, I will make thy horn iron,

74
00:03:45,576 --> 00:03:46,719
 and I will make thy hoofs brass. And thou shalt

75
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:47,862
 beat in pieces many people; and I will consecrate

76
00:03:47,862 --> 00:03:49,005
 their gain unto the Lord, and their substance unto

77
00:03:49,005 --> 00:03:50,148
 the Lord of the whole earth. And behold, I am he who

78
00:03:50,148 --> 00:03:51,291
 doeth it

79
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:56,064
20 And it shall come to pass, saith the Father,

80
00:03:56,064 --> 00:04:00,864
 that the sword of my justice shall hang over them at

81
00:04:00,864 --> 00:04:05,664
 that day; and except they repent it shall fall

82
00:04:05,664 --> 00:04:10,464
 upon them, saith the Father, yea, even upon all the

83
00:04:10,464 --> 00:04:15,264
 nations of the Gentiles

84
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:19,188
21 And it shall come to pass that I will establish

85
00:04:19,188 --> 00:04:23,188
 my people, O house of Israel

86
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:24,496
22 And behold, this people will I establish in

87
00:04:24,496 --> 00:04:25,829
 this land, unto the fulfilling of the covenant which

88
00:04:25,829 --> 00:04:27,162
 I made with your father Jacob; and it shall be a

89
00:04:27,162 --> 00:04:28,495
 New Jerusalem. And the powers of heaven shall be in

90
00:04:28,495 --> 00:04:29,828
 the midst of this people; yea, even I will be in

91
00:04:29,828 --> 00:04:31,161
 the midst of you

92
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:32,281
23 Behold, I am he of whom Moses spake, saying: A

93
00:04:32,281 --> 00:04:33,424
 prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you

94
00:04:33,424 --> 00:04:34,567
 of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear

95
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:35,71
 in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.

96
00:04:35,71 --> 00:04:36,853
 And it shall come to pass that every soul who will

97
00:04:36,853 --> 00:04:37,996
 not hear that prophet shall be cut off from among

98
00:04:37,996 --> 00:04:39,139
 the people

99
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:44,445
24 Verily I say unto you, yea, and all the

100
00:04:44,445 --> 00:04:49,778
 prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many

101
00:04:49,778 --> 00:04:55,111
 as have spoken, have testified of me

102
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:58,261
25 And behold, ye are the children of the

103
00:04:58,261 --> 00:05:01,461
 prophets; and ye are of the house of Israel; and ye are of

104
00:05:01,461 --> 00:05:04,661
 the covenant which the Father made with your

105
00:05:04,661 --> 00:05:07,861
 fathers, saying unto Abraham: And in thy seed shall

106
00:05:07,861 --> 00:05:11,061
 all the kindreds of the earth be blessed

107
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:16,761
26 The Father having raised me up unto you first,

108
00:05:16,761 --> 00:05:22,511
 and sent me to bless you in turning away every one

109
00:05:22,511 --> 00:05:28,261
 of you from his iniquities; and this because ye

110
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:34,011
 are the children of the covenant

111
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:35,935
27 And after that ye were blessed then fulfilleth

112
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:36,935
 the Father the covenant which he made with

113
00:05:36,935 --> 00:05:37,935
 Abraham, saying: In thy seed shall all the kindreds of

114
00:05:37,935 --> 00:05:38,935
 the earth be blessed—unto the pouring out of the

115
00:05:38,935 --> 00:05:39,935
 Holy Ghost through me upon the Gentiles, which

116
00:05:39,935 --> 00:05:40,935
 blessing upon the Gentiles shall make them mighty above

117
00:05:40,935 --> 00:05:41,935
 all, unto the scattering of my people, O house of

118
00:05:41,935 --> 00:05:42,935
 Israel

119
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,242
28 And they shall be a scourge unto the people of

120
00:05:44,242 --> 00:05:45,575
 this land. Nevertheless, when they shall have

121
00:05:45,575 --> 00:05:46,908
 received the fulness of my gospel, then if they shall

122
00:05:46,908 --> 00:05:48,241
 harden their hearts against me I will return their

123
00:05:48,241 --> 00:05:49,574
 iniquities upon their own heads, saith the

124
00:05:49,574 --> 00:05:50,907
 Father

125
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:53,17
29 And I will remember the covenant which I have

126
00:05:53,17 --> 00:05:55,456
 made with my people; and I have covenanted with

127
00:05:55,456 --> 00:05:57,742
 them that I would gather them together in mine own

128
00:05:57,742 --> 00:06:00,028
 due time, that I would give unto them again the land

129
00:06:00,028 --> 00:06:02,314
 of their fathers for their inheritance, which is

130
00:06:02,314 --> 00:06:04,6
 the land of Jerusalem, which is the promised land

131
00:06:04,6 --> 00:06:06,886
 unto them forever, saith the Father

132
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,5
30 And it shall come to pass that the time cometh,

133
00:06:09,5 --> 00:06:12,167
 when the fulness of my gospel shall be preached

134
00:06:12,167 --> 00:06:14,834
 unto them

135
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:17,475
31 And they shall believe in me, that I am Jesus

136
00:06:17,475 --> 00:06:20,142
 Christ, the Son of God, and shall pray unto the

137
00:06:20,142 --> 00:06:22,809
 Father in my name

138
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:25,449
32 Then shall their watchmen lift up their voice,

139
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:28,116
 and with the voice together shall they sing; for

140
00:06:28,116 --> 00:06:30,783
 they shall see eye to eye

141
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:33,424
33 Then will the Father gather them together

142
00:06:33,424 --> 00:06:36,091
 again, and give unto them Jerusalem for the land of

143
00:06:36,091 --> 00:06:38,758
 their inheritance

144
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:42,732
34 Then shall they break forth into joy—Sing

145
00:06:42,732 --> 00:06:46,732
 together, ye waste places of Jerusalem; for the Father

146
00:06:46,732 --> 00:06:50,732
 hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed

147
00:06:50,732 --> 00:06:54,732
 Jerusalem

148
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:58,681
35 The Father hath made bare his holy arm in the

149
00:06:58,681 --> 00:07:02,681
 eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the

150
00:07:02,681 --> 00:07:06,681
 earth shall see the salvation of the Father; and the

151
00:07:06,681 --> 00:07:10,681
 Father and I are one

152
00:07:10,63 --> 00:07:13,297
36 And then shall be brought to pass that which is

153
00:07:13,297 --> 00:07:15,964
 written: Awake, awake again, and put on thy

154
00:07:15,964 --> 00:07:18,631
 strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O

155
00:07:18,631 --> 00:07:21,298
 Jerusalem, the holy city, for henceforth there shall

156
00:07:21,298 --> 00:07:23,965
 no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the

157
00:07:23,965 --> 00:07:26,632
 unclean

158
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:29,246
37 Shake thyself from the dust; arise, sit down, O

159
00:07:29,246 --> 00:07:31,913
 Jerusalem; loose thyself from the bands of thy

160
00:07:31,913 --> 00:07:34,58
 neck, O captive daughter of Zion

161
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:39,887
38 For thus saith the Lord: Ye have sold

162
00:07:39,887 --> 00:07:45,22
 yourselves for naught, and ye shall be redeemed without

163
00:07:45,22 --> 00:07:50,553
 money

164
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:53,17
39 Verily, verily, I say unto you, that my people

165
00:07:53,17 --> 00:07:55,837
 shall know my name; yea, in that day they shall

166
00:07:55,837 --> 00:07:58,504
 know that I am he that doth speak

167
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:06,478
40 And then shall they say: How beautiful upon the

168
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:14,478
 mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good

169
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:22,478
 tidings unto them, that publisheth peace; that

170
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:30,478
 bringeth good tidings unto them of good, that

171
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:38,478
 publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion: Thy God

172
00:08:38,478 --> 00:08:46,478
 reigneth

173
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:54,326
41 And then shall a cry go forth: Depart ye,

174
00:08:54,326 --> 00:09:02,326
 depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch not that which

175
00:09:02,326 --> 00:09:10,326
 is unclean; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye

176
00:09:10,326 --> 00:09:18,326
 clean that bear the vessels of the Lord

177
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:36,891
42 For ye shall not go out with haste nor go by

178
00:09:36,891 --> 00:09:55,558
 flight; for the Lord will go before you, and the God

179
00:09:55,558 --> 00:10:14,225
 of Israel shall be your rearward

180
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:21,547
43 Behold, my servant shall deal prudently; he

181
00:10:21,547 --> 00:10:29,047
 shall be exalted and extolled and be very high

182
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:43,329
44 As many were astonished at thee—his visage was

183
00:10:43,329 --> 00:10:56,662
 so marred, more than any man, and his form more

184
00:10:56,662 --> 00:11:09,995
 than the sons of men

185
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,869
45 So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings

186
00:11:11,869 --> 00:11:13,869
 shall shut their mouths at him, for that which had

187
00:11:13,869 --> 00:11:15,869
 not been told them shall they see; and that which

188
00:11:15,869 --> 00:11:17,869
 they had not heard shall they consider

189
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:17,987
46 Verily, verily, I say unto you, all these

190
00:11:17,987 --> 00:11:18,13
 things shall surely come, even as the Father hath

191
00:11:18,13 --> 00:11:18,273
 commanded me. Then shall this covenant which the Father

192
00:11:18,273 --> 00:11:18,416
 hath covenanted with his people be fulfilled; and

193
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:18,559
 then shall Jerusalem be inhabited again with my

194
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:18,702
 people, and it shall be the land of their

195
00:11:18,702 --> 00:11:18,845
 inheritance.
