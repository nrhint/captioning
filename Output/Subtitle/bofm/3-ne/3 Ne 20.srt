00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 20 Jesus provides bread and wine

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
miraculously and again administers the sacrament

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
unto the people—The remnant of Jacob will

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
come to the knowledge of the Lord their God and

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
will inherit the Americas—Jesus is the

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
prophet like unto Moses, and the Nephites are

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
children of the prophets—Others of the Lord’s

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:10:40,
people will be gathered to Jerusalem. About A.D. 34. 

9
00:10:40,0 --> 00:10:40,0
1 And it came to pass that he

10
00:10:40,0 --> 00:10:40,0
commanded the multitude that they should

11
00:10:40,0 --> 00:10:40,0
cease to pray, and also his

12
00:10:40,0 --> 00:10:40,0
disciples. And he commanded them that they

13
00:10:40,0 --> 00:27:48,
should not cease to pray in their hearts.

14
00:27:48,0 --> 00:27:48,0
2 And he commanded them that

15
00:27:48,0 --> 00:27:48,0
they should arise and stand up

16
00:27:48,0 --> 00:27:48,0
upon their feet. And they

17
00:27:48,0 --> 00:27:20,
arose up and stood upon their feet.

18
00:27:20,0 --> 00:27:20,0
3 And it came to pass

19
00:27:20,0 --> 00:27:20,0
that he brake bread again

20
00:27:20,0 --> 00:27:20,0
and blessed it, and gave

21
00:27:20,0 --> 00:29:32,
to the disciples to eat.

22
00:29:32,0 --> 00:29:32,0
4 And when they had

23
00:29:32,0 --> 00:29:32,0
eaten he commanded

24
00:29:32,0 --> 00:29:32,0
them that they should

25
00:29:32,0 --> 00:29:32,0
break bread, and

26
00:29:32,0 --> 00:34:14,
give unto the multitude.

27
00:34:14,0 --> 00:34:14,0
5 And when they had

28
00:34:14,0 --> 00:34:14,0
given unto the

29
00:34:14,0 --> 00:34:14,0
multitude he also gave

30
00:34:14,0 --> 00:34:14,0
them wine to

31
00:34:14,0 --> 00:34:14,0
drink, and commanded

32
00:34:14,0 --> 00:34:14,0
them that they should

33
00:34:14,0 --> 00:37:59,
give unto the multitude.

34
00:37:59,0 --> 00:37:59,0
6 Now, there had

35
00:37:59,0 --> 00:37:59,0
been no bread,

36
00:37:59,0 --> 00:37:59,0
neither wine,

37
00:37:59,0 --> 00:37:59,0
brought by the

38
00:37:59,0 --> 00:37:59,0
disciples, neither

39
00:37:59,0 --> 00:46:41,
by the multitude;

40
00:46:41,0 --> 00:46:41,0
7 But he

41
00:46:41,0 --> 00:46:41,0
truly gave unto

42
00:46:41,0 --> 00:46:41,0
them bread to

43
00:46:41,0 --> 00:46:41,0
eat, and also

44
00:46:41,0 --> 00:46:13,
wine to drink.

45
00:46:13,0 --> 00:46:13,0
8 And he

46
00:46:13,0 --> 00:46:13,0
said unto them:

47
00:46:13,0 --> 00:46:13,0
He that

48
00:46:13,0 --> 00:46:13,0
eateth this

49
00:46:13,0 --> 00:46:13,0
bread eateth of

50
00:46:13,0 --> 00:46:13,0
my body to

51
00:46:13,0 --> 00:46:13,0
his soul;

52
00:46:13,0 --> 00:46:13,0
and he that

53
00:46:13,0 --> 00:46:13,0
drinketh of

54
00:46:13,0 --> 00:46:13,0
this wine

55
00:46:13,0 --> 00:46:13,0
drinketh of my

56
00:46:13,0 --> 00:46:13,0
blood to his

57
00:46:13,0 --> 00:46:13,0
soul; and

58
00:46:13,0 --> 00:46:13,0
his soul shall

59
00:46:13,0 --> 00:46:13,0
never

60
00:46:13,0 --> 00:46:13,0
hunger nor

61
00:46:13,0 --> 00:45:45,
thirst, but shall be filled.

62
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
9 Now, when

63
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
the

64
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
multitude had all

65
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
eaten and

66
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
drunk,

67
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
behold, they

68
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
were filled

69
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
with the

70
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
Spirit; and

71
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
they did cry

72
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
out with

73
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
one voice,

74
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
and gave

75
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
glory to Jesus,

76
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
whom they

77
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:59,
both saw and heard.

78
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
10 And it

79
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
came to

80
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
pass that

81
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
when they

82
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
had all

83
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
given glory

84
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
unto Jesus,

85
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
he said

86
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
unto them:

87
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
Behold now

88
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
I finish

89
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
the

90
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
commandment which

91
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
the

92
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
Father hath

93
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
commanded me

94
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
concerning

95
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
this

96
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
people, who

97
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
are a

98
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:45,
remnant of the house of Israel.

99
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
11 Ye

100
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
remember

101
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
that I spake

102
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
unto

103
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
you, and

104
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
said that

105
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
when the

106
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
words of

107
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
Isaiah

108
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
should be

109
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0


110
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
fulfilled—behold they

111
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
are

112
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
written, ye

113
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
have them

114
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
before

115
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:59,
you, therefore search them—

116
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
12 And

117
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
verily,

118
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
verily, I

119
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
say

120
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
unto you,

121
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
that when

122
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
they

123
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
shall be

124
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
fulfilled

125
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
then is

126
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
the

127
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
fulfilling

128
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
of the

129
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
covenant

130
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
which

131
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
the Father

132
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
hath

133
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
made unto

134
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
his

135
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:45,
people, O house of Israel.

136
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
13 And

137
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
then

138
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
shall the

139

141
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
which

142
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
shall be

143
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0

00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
they

163
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
shall be

Father

173
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
hath

174
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0


175
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0

your inheritance.

184
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
15

185
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
And I

186

187
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
unto

188
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
you,

189
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
that if

00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:45,0
they

207
00:45:45,0 --> 00:45:59,
have scattered my people—

208
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
16

209
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
Then
