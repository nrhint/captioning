Chapter 4 The Nephite armies defeat the Gadianton

2
00:00:10,5 --> 00:00:21,0
 robbers—Giddianhi is slain, and his successor,

3
00:00:21,0 --> 00:00:31,5
 Zemnarihah, is hanged—The Nephites praise the Lord

4
00:00:31,5 --> 00:00:42,0
 for their victories. About A.D. 19–22.

5
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:43,169
1 And it came to pass that in the latter end of

6
00:00:43,169 --> 00:00:43,896
 the eighteenth year those armies of robbers had

7
00:00:43,896 --> 00:00:44,623
 prepared for battle, and began to come down and to

8
00:00:44,623 --> 00:00:45,35
 sally forth from the hills, and out of the mountains,

9
00:00:45,35 --> 00:00:46,077
 and the wilderness, and their strongholds, and

10
00:00:46,077 --> 00:00:46,804
 their secret places, and began to take possession of

11
00:00:46,804 --> 00:00:47,531
 the lands, both which were in the land south and

12
00:00:47,531 --> 00:00:48,258
 which were in the land north, and began to take

13
00:00:48,258 --> 00:00:48,985
 possession of all the lands which had been deserted

14
00:00:48,985 --> 00:00:49,712
 by the Nephites, and the cities which had been

15
00:00:49,712 --> 00:00:50,439
 left desolate

16
00:00:50,417 --> 00:01:11,167
2 But behold, there were no wild beasts nor game

17
00:01:11,167 --> 00:01:31,917
 in those lands which had been deserted by the

18
00:01:31,917 --> 00:01:52,667
 Nephites, and there was no game for the robbers save it

19
00:01:52,667 --> 00:02:13,417
 were in the wilderness

20
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:18,933
3 And the robbers could not exist save it were in

21
00:02:18,933 --> 00:02:24,733
 the wilderness, for the want of food; for the

22
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:30,533
 Nephites had left their lands desolate, and had

23
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:36,333
 gathered their flocks and their herds and all their

24
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:42,133
 substance, and they were in one body

25
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:49,029
4 Therefore, there was no chance for the robbers

26
00:02:49,029 --> 00:02:55,229
 to plunder and to obtain food, save it were to come

27
00:02:55,229 --> 00:03:01,429
 up in open battle against the Nephites; and the

28
00:03:01,429 --> 00:03:07,629
 Nephites being in one body, and having so great a

29
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:13,829
 number, and having reserved for themselves

30
00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:20,029
 provisions, and horses and cattle, and flocks of every

31
00:03:20,029 --> 00:03:26,229
 kind, that they might subsist for the space of seven

32
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:32,429
 years, in the which time they did hope to destroy

33
00:03:32,429 --> 00:03:38,629
 the robbers from off the face of the land; and

34
00:03:38,629 --> 00:03:44,829
 thus the eighteenth year did pass away

35
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:49,624
5 And it came to pass that in the nineteenth year

36
00:03:49,624 --> 00:03:55,224
 Giddianhi found that it was expedient that he

37
00:03:55,224 --> 00:04:00,824
 should go up to battle against the Nephites, for there

38
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:06,424
 was no way that they could subsist save it were

39
00:04:06,424 --> 00:04:12,024
 to plunder and rob and murder

40
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:17,385
6 And they durst not spread themselves upon the

41
00:04:17,385 --> 00:04:22,718
 face of the land insomuch that they could raise

42
00:04:22,718 --> 00:04:28,051
 grain, lest the Nephites should come upon them and

43
00:04:28,051 --> 00:04:33,384
 slay them; therefore Giddianhi gave commandment unto

44
00:04:33,384 --> 00:04:38,717
 his armies that in this year they should go up to

45
00:04:38,717 --> 00:04:44,05
 battle against the Nephites

46
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:50,785
7 And it came to pass that they did come up to

47
00:04:50,785 --> 00:04:56,785
 battle; and it was in the sixth month; and behold,

48
00:04:56,785 --> 00:05:02,785
 great and terrible was the day that they did come up

49
00:05:02,785 --> 00:05:08,785
 to battle; and they were girded about after the

50
00:05:08,785 --> 00:05:14,785
 manner of robbers; and they had a lamb-skin about

51
00:05:14,785 --> 00:05:20,785
 their loins, and they were dyed in blood, and their

52
00:05:20,785 --> 00:05:26,785
 heads were shorn, and they had head-plates upon

53
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:32,785
 them; and great and terrible was the appearance of

54
00:05:32,785 --> 00:05:38,785
 the armies of Giddianhi, because of their armor,

55
00:05:38,785 --> 00:05:44,785
 and because of their being dyed in blood

56
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:49,944
8 And it came to pass that the armies of the

57
00:05:49,944 --> 00:05:55,277
 Nephites, when they saw the appearance of the army of

58
00:05:55,277 --> 00:06:00,61
 Giddianhi, had all fallen to the earth, and did

59
00:06:00,61 --> 00:06:05,943
 lift their cries to the Lord their God, that he would

60
00:06:05,943 --> 00:06:11,276
 spare them and deliver them out of the hands of

61
00:06:11,276 --> 00:06:16,609
 their enemies

62
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:21,476
9 And it came to pass that when the armies of

63
00:06:21,476 --> 00:06:26,676
 Giddianhi saw this they began to shout with a loud

64
00:06:26,676 --> 00:06:31,876
 voice, because of their joy, for they had supposed

65
00:06:31,876 --> 00:06:37,076
 that the Nephites had fallen with fear because of

66
00:06:37,076 --> 00:06:42,276
 the terror of their armies

67
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:48,269
10 But in this thing they were disappointed, for

68
00:06:48,269 --> 00:06:53,769
 the Nephites did not fear them; but they did fear

69
00:06:53,769 --> 00:06:59,269
 their God and did supplicate him for protection;

70
00:06:59,269 --> 00:07:04,769
 therefore, when the armies of Giddianhi did rush

71
00:07:04,769 --> 00:07:10,269
 upon them they were prepared to meet them; yea, in

72
00:07:10,269 --> 00:07:15,769
 the strength of the Lord they did receive them

73
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:21,436
11 And the battle commenced in this the sixth

74
00:07:21,436 --> 00:07:27,103
 month; and great and terrible was the battle thereof,

75
00:07:27,103 --> 00:07:32,77
 yea, great and terrible was the slaughter thereof,

76
00:07:32,77 --> 00:07:38,437
 insomuch that there never was known so great a

77
00:07:38,437 --> 00:07:44,104
 slaughter among all the people of Lehi since he left

78
00:07:44,104 --> 00:07:49,771
 Jerusalem

79
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:54,002
12 And notwithstanding the threatenings and the

80
00:07:54,002 --> 00:07:59,002
 oaths which Giddianhi had made, behold, the Nephites

81
00:07:59,002 --> 00:08:04,002
 did beat them, insomuch that they did fall back

82
00:08:04,002 --> 00:08:09,002
 from before them

83
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:15,379
13 And it came to pass that Gidgiddoni commanded

84
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:21,236
 that his armies should pursue them as far as the

85
00:08:21,236 --> 00:08:27,093
 borders of the wilderness, and that they should not

86
00:08:27,093 --> 00:08:32,95
 spare any that should fall into their hands by the

87
00:08:32,95 --> 00:08:38,807
 way; and thus they did pursue them and did slay

88
00:08:38,807 --> 00:08:44,664
 them, to the borders of the wilderness, even until

89
00:08:44,664 --> 00:08:50,521
 they had fulfilled the commandment of Gidgiddoni

90
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:56,497
14 And it came to pass that Giddianhi, who had

91
00:08:56,497 --> 00:09:02,497
 stood and fought with boldness, was pursued as he

92
00:09:02,497 --> 00:09:08,497
 fled; and being weary because of his much fighting he

93
00:09:08,497 --> 00:09:14,497
 was overtaken and slain. And thus was the end of

94
00:09:14,497 --> 00:09:20,497
 Giddianhi the robber

95
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:24,927
15 And it came to pass that the armies of the

96
00:09:24,927 --> 00:09:29,427
 Nephites did return again to their place of security.

97
00:09:29,427 --> 00:09:33,927
 And it came to pass that this nineteenth year did

98
00:09:33,927 --> 00:09:38,427
 pass away, and the robbers did not come again to

99
00:09:38,427 --> 00:09:42,927
 battle; neither did they come again in the

100
00:09:42,927 --> 00:09:47,427
 twentieth year

101
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:52,597
16 And in the twenty and first year they did not

102
00:09:52,597 --> 00:09:58,041
 come up to battle, but they came up on all sides to

103
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:03,485
 lay siege round about the people of Nephi; for

104
00:10:03,485 --> 00:10:08,929
 they did suppose that if they should cut off the

105
00:10:08,929 --> 00:10:14,373
 people of Nephi from their lands, and should hem them

106
00:10:14,373 --> 00:10:19,817
 in on every side, and if they should cut them off

107
00:10:19,817 --> 00:10:25,261
 from all their outward privileges, that they

108
00:10:25,261 --> 00:10:30,705
 could cause them to yield themselves up according to

109
00:10:30,705 --> 00:10:36,149
 their wishes

110
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:41,135
17 Now they had appointed unto themselves another

111
00:10:41,135 --> 00:10:46,135
 leader, whose name was Zemnarihah; therefore it

112
00:10:46,135 --> 00:10:51,135
 was Zemnarihah that did cause that this siege should

113
00:10:51,135 --> 00:10:56,135
 take place

114
00:10:56,956 --> 00:11:02,556
18 But behold, this was an advantage to the

115
00:11:02,556 --> 00:11:08,156
 Nephites; for it was impossible for the robbers to lay

116
00:11:08,156 --> 00:11:13,756
 siege sufficiently long to have any effect upon the

117
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:19,356
 Nephites, because of their much provision which

118
00:11:19,356 --> 00:11:24,956
 they had laid up in store

119
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:32,017
19 And because of the scantiness of provisions

120
00:11:32,017 --> 00:11:40,017
 among the robbers; for behold, they had nothing save

121
00:11:40,017 --> 00:11:48,017
 it were meat for their subsistence, which meat

122
00:11:48,017 --> 00:11:56,017
 they did obtain in the wilderness

123
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:58,348
20 And it came to pass that the wild game became

124
00:11:58,348 --> 00:12:00,681
 scarce in the wilderness insomuch that the robbers

125
00:12:00,681 --> 00:12:03,014
 were about to perish with hunger

126
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:08,773
21 And the Nephites were continually marching out

127
00:12:08,773 --> 00:12:14,023
 by day and by night, and falling upon their

128
00:12:14,023 --> 00:12:19,273
 armies, and cutting them off by thousands and by tens of

129
00:12:19,273 --> 00:12:24,523
 thousands

130
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:29,527
22 And thus it became the desire of the people of

131
00:12:29,527 --> 00:12:34,777
 Zemnarihah to withdraw from their design, because

132
00:12:34,777 --> 00:12:40,027
 of the great destruction which came upon them by

133
00:12:40,027 --> 00:12:45,277
 night and by day

134
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:49,264
23 And it came to pass that Zemnarihah did give

135
00:12:49,264 --> 00:12:53,264
 command unto his people that they should withdraw

136
00:12:53,264 --> 00:12:57,264
 themselves from the siege, and march into the

137
00:12:57,264 --> 00:13:01,264
 furthermost parts of the land northward

138
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:07,385
24 And now, Gidgiddoni being aware of their

139
00:13:07,385 --> 00:13:12,956
 design, and knowing of their weakness because of the

140
00:13:12,956 --> 00:13:18,527
 want of food, and the great slaughter which had been

141
00:13:18,527 --> 00:13:24,098
 made among them, therefore he did send out his

142
00:13:24,098 --> 00:13:29,669
 armies in the night-time, and did cut off the way of

143
00:13:29,669 --> 00:13:35,24
 their retreat, and did place his armies in the way

144
00:13:35,24 --> 00:13:40,811
 of their retreat

145
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:45,819
25 And this did they do in the night-time, and got

146
00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:51,619
 on their march beyond the robbers, so that on the

147
00:13:51,619 --> 00:13:57,419
 morrow, when the robbers began their march, they

148
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:03,219
 were met by the armies of the Nephites both in

149
00:14:03,219 --> 00:14:09,019
 their front and in their rear

150
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:15,315
26 And the robbers who were on the south were also

151
00:14:15,315 --> 00:14:21,315
 cut off in their places of retreat. And all these

152
00:14:21,315 --> 00:14:27,315
 things were done by command of Gidgiddoni

153
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:33,601
27 And there were many thousands who did yield

154
00:14:33,601 --> 00:14:39,268
 themselves up prisoners unto the Nephites, and the

155
00:14:39,268 --> 00:14:44,935
 remainder of them were slain

156
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:51,584
28 And their leader, Zemnarihah, was taken and

157
00:14:51,584 --> 00:14:58,184
 hanged upon a tree, yea, even upon the top thereof

158
00:14:58,184 --> 00:15:04,784
 until he was dead. And when they had hanged him

159
00:15:04,784 --> 00:15:11,384
 until he was dead they did fell the tree to the earth,

160
00:15:11,384 --> 00:15:17,984
 and did cry with a loud voice, saying

161
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:23,683
29 May the Lord preserve his people in

162
00:15:23,683 --> 00:15:30,283
 righteousness and in holiness of heart, that they may cause

163
00:15:30,283 --> 00:15:36,883
 to be felled to the earth all who shall seek to

164
00:15:36,883 --> 00:15:43,483
 slay them because of power and secret combinations,

165
00:15:43,483 --> 00:15:50,083
 even as this man hath been felled to the earth

166
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:56,216
30 And they did rejoice and cry again with one

167
00:15:56,216 --> 00:16:02,416
 voice, saying: May the God of Abraham, and the God of

168
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:08,616
 Isaac, and the God of Jacob, protect this people

169
00:16:08,616 --> 00:16:14,816
 in righteousness, so long as they shall call on

170
00:16:14,816 --> 00:16:21,016
 the name of their God for protection

171
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:25,414
31 And it came to pass that they did break forth,

172
00:16:25,414 --> 00:16:29,614
 all as one, in singing, and praising their God for

173
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:33,814
 the great thing which he had done for them, in

174
00:16:33,814 --> 00:16:38,014
 preserving them from falling into the hands of their

175
00:16:38,014 --> 00:16:42,214
 enemies

176
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:49,702
32 Yea, they did cry: Hosanna to the Most High

177
00:16:49,702 --> 00:16:56,702
 God. And they did cry: Blessed be the name of the

178
00:16:56,702 --> 00:17:03,702
 Lord God Almighty, the Most High God

179
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:08,651
33 And their hearts were swollen with joy, unto

180
00:17:08,651 --> 00:17:14,08
 the gushing out of many tears, because of the great

181
00:17:14,08 --> 00:17:19,509
 goodness of God in delivering them out of the

182
00:17:19,509 --> 00:17:24,938
 hands of their enemies; and they knew it was because

183
00:17:24,938 --> 00:17:30,367
 of their repentance and their humility that they

184
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:35,796
 had been delivered from an everlasting destruction.

185
00:17:35,796 --> 00:17:41,225
