00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,75
Chapter 4 The Nephite armies defeat the

2
00:00:01,75 --> 00:00:03,5
Gadianton robbers—Giddianhi is slain, and his

3
00:00:03,5 --> 00:00:05,25
successor, Zemnarihah, is hanged—The Nephites praise

4
00:00:05,25 --> 00:00:07,508
the Lord for their victories. About A.D. 19–22. 

5
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:10,175
1 And it came to pass that in the latter

6
00:00:10,175 --> 00:00:12,841
end of the eighteenth year those armies of

7
00:00:12,841 --> 00:00:15,508
robbers had prepared for battle, and began

8
00:00:15,508 --> 00:00:18,175
to come down and to sally forth from the

9
00:00:18,175 --> 00:00:20,843
hills, and out of the mountains, and the

10
00:00:20,843 --> 00:00:23,509
wilderness, and their strongholds, and

11
00:00:23,509 --> 00:00:26,176
their secret places, and began to take

12
00:00:26,176 --> 00:00:28,843
possession of the lands, both which were in the

13
00:00:28,843 --> 00:00:31,511
land south and which were in the land

14
00:00:31,511 --> 00:00:34,177
north, and began to take possession of all the

15
00:00:34,177 --> 00:00:36,844
lands which had been deserted by the

16
00:00:36,844 --> 00:00:39,873
Nephites, and the cities which had been left desolate.

17
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:39,673
2 But behold, there were no wild

18
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:39,473
beasts nor game in those lands

19
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:39,273
which had been deserted by the

20
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:39,073
Nephites, and there was no game for the

21
00:00:39,073 --> 00:00:38,939
robbers save it were in the wilderness.

22
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:38,939
3 And the robbers could not exist

23
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:38,939
save it were in the wilderness,

24
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:38,939
for the want of food; for the

25
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:38,939
Nephites had left their lands

26
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:38,939
desolate, and had gathered their flocks

27
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:38,939
and their herds and all their

28
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:38,005
substance, and they were in one body.

29
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:37,938
4 Therefore, there was no chance

30
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:37,871
for the robbers to plunder and

31
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:37,804
to obtain food, save it were to

32
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:37,737
come up in open battle against

33
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:37,67
the Nephites; and the Nephites

34
00:00:37,67 --> 00:00:37,603
being in one body, and having so

35
00:00:37,603 --> 00:00:37,536
great a number, and having

36
00:00:37,536 --> 00:00:37,469
reserved for themselves provisions,

37
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:37,402
and horses and cattle, and flocks

38
00:00:37,402 --> 00:00:37,335
of every kind, that they might

39
00:00:37,335 --> 00:00:37,268
subsist for the space of seven

40
00:00:37,268 --> 00:00:37,201
years, in the which time they did

41
00:00:37,201 --> 00:00:37,134
hope to destroy the robbers from

42
00:00:37,134 --> 00:00:37,067
off the face of the land; and

43
00:00:37,067 --> 00:00:37,07
thus the eighteenth year did pass away.

44
00:00:37,07 --> 00:00:36,945
5 And it came to pass that

45
00:00:36,945 --> 00:00:36,82
in the nineteenth year

46
00:00:36,82 --> 00:00:36,695
Giddianhi found that it was

47
00:00:36,695 --> 00:00:36,57
expedient that he should go up to

48
00:00:36,57 --> 00:00:36,445
battle against the Nephites,

49
00:00:36,445 --> 00:00:36,32
for there was no way that

50
00:00:36,32 --> 00:00:36,195
they could subsist save it

51
00:00:36,195 --> 00:00:36,136
were to plunder and rob and murder.

52
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:36,336
6 And they durst not spread

53
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:36,536
themselves upon the face

54
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:36,736
of the land insomuch that

55
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:36,936
they could raise grain, lest

56
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:37,136
the Nephites should come

57
00:00:37,136 --> 00:00:37,336
upon them and slay them;

58
00:00:37,336 --> 00:00:37,536
therefore Giddianhi gave

59
00:00:37,536 --> 00:00:37,736
commandment unto his armies that

60
00:00:37,736 --> 00:00:37,936
in this year they should go

61
00:00:37,936 --> 00:00:38,538
up to battle against the Nephites.

62
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:38,486
7 And it came to pass

63
00:00:38,486 --> 00:00:38,432
that they did come up to

64
00:00:38,432 --> 00:00:38,38
battle; and it was in the

65
00:00:38,38 --> 00:00:38,326
sixth month; and behold,

66
00:00:38,326 --> 00:00:38,273
great and terrible was the

67
00:00:38,273 --> 00:00:38,221
day that they did come up

68
00:00:38,221 --> 00:00:38,167
to battle; and they were

69
00:00:38,167 --> 00:00:38,114
girded about after the

70
00:00:38,114 --> 00:00:38,062
manner of robbers; and

71
00:00:38,062 --> 00:00:38,008
they had a lamb-skin about

72
00:00:38,008 --> 00:00:37,956
their loins, and they were

73
00:00:37,956 --> 00:00:37,902
dyed in blood, and their

74
00:00:37,902 --> 00:00:37,849
heads were shorn, and

75
00:00:37,849 --> 00:00:37,797
they had head-plates upon

76
00:00:37,797 --> 00:00:37,743
them; and great and

77
00:00:37,743 --> 00:00:37,691
terrible was the appearance of

78
00:00:37,691 --> 00:00:37,637
the armies of Giddianhi,

79
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:37,584
because of their armor,

80
00:00:37,584 --> 00:00:37,604
and because of their being dyed in blood.

81
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:38,059
8 And it came to pass

82
00:00:38,059 --> 00:00:38,514
that the armies of the

83
00:00:38,514 --> 00:00:38,969
Nephites, when they saw

84
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:39,424
the appearance of the

85
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:39,879
army of Giddianhi, had

86
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:40,334
all fallen to the earth,

87
00:00:40,334 --> 00:00:40,789
and did lift their

88
00:00:40,789 --> 00:00:41,244
cries to the Lord their

89
00:00:41,244 --> 00:00:41,699
God, that he would spare

90
00:00:41,699 --> 00:00:42,154
them and deliver them

91
00:00:42,154 --> 00:00:42,009
out of the hands of their enemies.

92
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:41,909
9 And it came to pass

93
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:41,809
that when the armies

94
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:41,709
of Giddianhi saw this

95
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:41,609
they began to shout

96
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:41,509
with a loud voice,

97
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:41,409
because of their joy, for

98
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:41,309
they had supposed that

99
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:41,209
the Nephites had fallen

100
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:41,109
with fear because of

101
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:41,074
the terror of their armies.

102
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:41,36
10 But in this thing

103
00:00:41,36 --> 00:00:41,646
they were

104
00:00:41,646 --> 00:00:41,932
disappointed, for the Nephites

105
00:00:41,932 --> 00:00:42,218
did not fear them; but

106
00:00:42,218 --> 00:00:42,504
they did fear their

107
00:00:42,504 --> 00:00:42,79
God and did

108
00:00:42,79 --> 00:00:43,076
supplicate him for protection;

109
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:43,362
therefore, when the

110
00:00:43,362 --> 00:00:43,648
armies of Giddianhi

111
00:00:43,648 --> 00:00:43,934
did rush upon them

112
00:00:43,934 --> 00:00:44,22
they were prepared to

113
00:00:44,22 --> 00:00:44,506
meet them; yea, in the

114
00:00:44,506 --> 00:00:44,792
strength of the Lord

115
00:00:44,792 --> 00:00:45,479
they did receive them.

116
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:46,094
11 And the battle

117
00:00:46,094 --> 00:00:46,709
commenced in this the

118
00:00:46,709 --> 00:00:47,324
sixth month; and

119
00:00:47,324 --> 00:00:47,939
great and terrible was

120
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:48,554
the battle thereof,

121
00:00:48,554 --> 00:00:49,169
yea, great and

122
00:00:49,169 --> 00:00:49,784
terrible was the

123
00:00:49,784 --> 00:00:50,399
slaughter thereof, insomuch

124
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,014
that there never was

125
00:00:51,014 --> 00:00:51,629
known so great a

126
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:52,244
slaughter among all

127
00:00:52,244 --> 00:00:52,859
the people of Lehi

128
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:53,921
since he left Jerusalem.

129
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:55,477
12 And

130
00:00:55,477 --> 00:00:57,033
notwithstanding the

131
00:00:57,033 --> 00:00:58,589
threatenings and the oaths

132
00:00:58,589 --> 00:01:00,145
which Giddianhi

133
00:01:00,145 --> 00:01:01,701
had made, behold,

134
00:01:01,701 --> 00:01:03,257
the Nephites did

135
00:01:03,257 --> 00:01:04,813
beat them, insomuch

136
00:01:04,813 --> 00:01:06,369
that they did fall

137
00:01:06,369 --> 00:01:07,734
back from before them.

138
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:08,484
13 And it came to

139
00:01:08,484 --> 00:01:09,234
pass that

140
00:01:09,234 --> 00:01:09,984
Gidgiddoni commanded

141
00:01:09,984 --> 00:01:10,734
that his armies

142
00:01:10,734 --> 00:01:11,484
should pursue them

143
00:01:11,484 --> 00:01:12,234
as far as the

144
00:01:12,234 --> 00:01:12,984
borders of the

145
00:01:12,984 --> 00:01:13,734
wilderness, and that

146
00:01:13,734 --> 00:01:14,484
they should not

147
00:01:14,484 --> 00:01:15,234
spare any that

148
00:01:15,234 --> 00:01:15,984
should fall into their

149
00:01:15,984 --> 00:01:16,734
hands by the

150
00:01:16,734 --> 00:01:17,484
way; and thus they

151
00:01:17,484 --> 00:01:18,234
did pursue them

152
00:01:18,234 --> 00:01:18,984
and did slay them,

153
00:01:18,984 --> 00:01:19,734
to the borders of

154
00:01:19,734 --> 00:01:20,484
the wilderness,

155
00:01:20,484 --> 00:01:21,234
even until they

156
00:01:21,234 --> 00:01:21,984
had fulfilled the

157
00:01:21,984 --> 00:01:22,015
commandment of Gidgiddoni.

158
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:22,553
14 And it came to

159
00:01:22,553 --> 00:01:23,091
pass that

160
00:01:23,091 --> 00:01:23,629
Giddianhi, who had

161
00:01:23,629 --> 00:01:24,167
stood and fought with

162
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:24,705
boldness, was

163
00:01:24,705 --> 00:01:25,243
pursued as he fled;

164
00:01:25,243 --> 00:01:25,781
and being weary

165
00:01:25,781 --> 00:01:26,319
because of his

166
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:26,857
much fighting he

167
00:01:26,857 --> 00:01:27,395
was overtaken and

168
00:01:27,395 --> 00:01:27,933
slain. And thus

169
00:01:27,933 --> 00:01:28,471
was the end of

170
00:01:28,471 --> 00:01:29,056
Giddianhi the robber.

171
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:29,931
15 And it came

172
00:01:29,931 --> 00:01:30,806
to pass that the

173
00:01:30,806 --> 00:01:31,681
armies of the

174
00:01:31,681 --> 00:01:32,556
Nephites did

175
00:01:32,556 --> 00:01:33,431
return again to their

176
00:01:33,431 --> 00:01:34,306
place of

177
00:01:34,306 --> 00:01:35,181
security. And it came

178
00:01:35,181 --> 00:01:36,056
to pass that

179
00:01:36,056 --> 00:01:36,931
this nineteenth

180
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:37,806
year did pass away,

181
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:38,681
and the robbers

182
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:39,556
did not come

183
00:01:39,556 --> 00:01:40,431
again to battle;

184
00:01:40,431 --> 00:01:41,306
neither did they

185
00:01:41,306 --> 00:01:42,181
come again in

186
00:01:42,181 --> 00:01:43,337
the twentieth year.

187
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:44,106
16 And in the

188
00:01:44,106 --> 00:01:44,875
twenty and first

189
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:45,644
year they did

190
00:01:45,644 --> 00:01:46,413
not come up to

191
00:01:46,413 --> 00:01:47,182
battle, but

192
00:01:47,182 --> 00:01:47,951
they came up on

193
00:01:47,951 --> 00:01:48,72
all sides to lay

194
00:01:48,72 --> 00:01:49,489
siege round

195
00:01:49,489 --> 00:01:50,258
about the people

196
00:01:50,258 --> 00:01:51,027
of Nephi; for

197
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:51,796
they did suppose

198
00:01:51,796 --> 00:01:52,565
that if they

199
00:01:52,565 --> 00:01:53,334
should cut off

200
00:01:53,334 --> 00:01:54,103
the people of

201
00:01:54,103 --> 00:01:54,872
Nephi from their

202
00:01:54,872 --> 00:01:55,641
lands, and

203
00:01:55,641 --> 00:01:56,41
should hem them in

204
00:01:56,41 --> 00:01:57,179
on every side,

205
00:01:57,179 --> 00:01:57,948
and if they

206
00:01:57,948 --> 00:01:58,717
should cut them off

207
00:01:58,717 --> 00:01:59,486
from all their

208
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:00,255
outward

209
00:02:00,255 --> 00:02:01,024
privileges, that they

210
00:02:01,024 --> 00:02:01,793
could cause

211
00:02:01,793 --> 00:02:02,562
them to yield

212
00:02:02,562 --> 00:02:03,69
themselves up according to their wishes.

213
00:02:03,69 --> 00:02:03,781
17 Now they

214
00:02:03,781 --> 00:02:03,872
had appointed

215
00:02:03,872 --> 00:02:03,963
unto themselves

216
00:02:03,963 --> 00:02:04,054
another

217
00:02:04,054 --> 00:02:04,145
leader, whose name

218
00:02:04,145 --> 00:02:04,236
was Zemnarihah;

219
00:02:04,236 --> 00:02:04,327
therefore it

220
00:02:04,327 --> 00:02:04,418
was Zemnarihah

221
00:02:04,418 --> 00:02:04,509
that did

222
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:04,6
cause that this

223
00:02:04,6 --> 00:02:04,157
siege should take place.

224
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:04,098
18 But

225
00:02:04,098 --> 00:02:04,039
behold, this was an

226
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:03,98
advantage to

227
00:02:03,98 --> 00:02:03,921
the

228
00:02:03,921 --> 00:02:03,862
Nephites; for it was

229
00:02:03,862 --> 00:02:03,803
impossible

230
00:02:03,803 --> 00:02:03,744
for the robbers

231
00:02:03,744 --> 00:02:03,685
to lay siege

232
00:02:03,685 --> 00:02:03,626
sufficiently

233
00:02:03,626 --> 00:02:03,567
long to have

234
00:02:03,567 --> 00:02:03,508
any effect

235
00:02:03,508 --> 00:02:03,449
upon the

236
00:02:03,449 --> 00:02:03,39
Nephites, because

237
00:02:03,39 --> 00:02:03,331
of their much

238
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:03,272
provision

239
00:02:03,272 --> 00:02:03,213
which they had

240
00:02:03,213 --> 00:02:03,69
laid up in store,

241
00:02:03,69 --> 00:02:03,761
19 And

242
00:02:03,761 --> 00:02:03,832
because of the

243
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:03,903
scantiness of

244
00:02:03,903 --> 00:02:03,974
provisions

245
00:02:03,974 --> 00:02:04,045
among the

246
00:02:04,045 --> 00:02:04,116
robbers; for

247
00:02:04,116 --> 00:02:04,187
behold, they

248
00:02:04,187 --> 00:02:04,258
had nothing

249
00:02:04,258 --> 00:02:04,329
save it were

250
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:04,4
meat for

251
00:02:04,4 --> 00:02:04,471
their

252
00:02:04,471 --> 00:02:04,542
subsistence, which

253
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:04,613
meat they did

254
00:02:04,613 --> 00:02:04,157
obtain in the wilderness;

255
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:04,074
20 And it

256
00:02:04,074 --> 00:02:03,991
came to pass

257
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:03,908
that the

258
00:02:03,908 --> 00:02:03,825
wild game

259
00:02:03,825 --> 00:02:03,742
became scarce

260
00:02:03,742 --> 00:02:03,659
in the

261
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:03,576
wilderness

262
00:02:03,576 --> 00:02:03,493
insomuch that

263
00:02:03,493 --> 00:02:03,41
the robbers

264
00:02:03,41 --> 00:02:03,327
were about

265
00:02:03,327 --> 00:02:03,244
to perish

266
00:02:03,244 --> 00:02:03,69
with hunger.

267
00:02:03,69 --> 00:02:03,757
21 And the

268
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:03,824
Nephites

269
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:03,891
were

270
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:03,958
continually

271
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:04,025
marching out

272
00:02:04,025 --> 00:02:04,092
by day and

273
00:02:04,092 --> 00:02:04,159
by night,

274
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:04,226
and

275
00:02:04,226 --> 00:02:04,293
falling upon

276
00:02:04,293 --> 00:02:04,36
their

277
00:02:04,36 --> 00:02:04,427
armies, and

278
00:02:04,427 --> 00:02:04,494
cutting them

279
00:02:04,494 --> 00:02:04,561
off by

280
00:02:04,561 --> 00:02:04,628
thousands and

281
00:02:04,628 --> 00:02:04,157
by tens of thousands.

282
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:04,098
22 And

283
00:02:04,098 --> 00:02:04,039
thus it

284
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:03,98
became the

285
00:02:03,98 --> 00:02:03,921
desire of

286
00:02:03,921 --> 00:02:03,862
the

287
00:02:03,862 --> 00:02:03,803
people of

288
00:02:03,803 --> 00:02:03,744
Zemnarihah to

289
00:02:03,744 --> 00:02:03,685
withdraw

290
00:02:03,685 --> 00:02:03,626
from

291
00:02:03,626 --> 00:02:03,567
their

292
00:02:03,567 --> 00:02:03,508
design, because

293
00:02:03,508 --> 00:02:03,449
of the

294
00:02:03,449 --> 00:02:03,39
great

295
00:02:03,39 --> 00:02:03,331
destruction

296
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:03,272
which came

297
00:02:03,272 --> 00:02:03,213
upon

298
00:02:03,213 --> 00:02:03,69
them by night and by day.

299
00:02:03,69 --> 00:02:03,738
23 And

300
00:02:03,738 --> 00:02:03,786
it came

301
00:02:03,786 --> 00:02:03,834
to pass

302
00:02:03,834 --> 00:02:03,882
that

303
00:02:03,882 --> 00:02:03,93
Zemnarihah

304
00:02:03,93 --> 00:02:03,978
did give

305
00:02:03,978 --> 00:02:04,026
command

306
00:02:04,026 --> 00:02:04,074
unto his

307
00:02:04,074 --> 00:02:04,122
people

308
00:02:04,122 --> 00:02:04,17
that

309
00:02:04,17 --> 00:02:04,218
they should

310
00:02:04,218 --> 00:02:04,266


311
00:02:04,266 --> 00:02:04,314
withdraw

312
00:02:04,314 --> 00:02:04,362
themselves

313
00:02:04,362 --> 00:02:04,41
from the

314
00:02:04,41 --> 00:02:04,458
siege, and

315
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:04,506
march

316
00:02:04,506 --> 00:02:04,554
into the

317
00:02:04,554 --> 00:02:04,602


318
00:02:04,602 --> 00:02:04,65
furthermost

319
00:02:04,65 --> 00:02:04,157
parts of the land northward.

320
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:04,132
24 And

321
00:02:04,132 --> 00:02:04,107
now,

322
00:02:04,107 --> 00:02:04,082


323
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:04,057
Gidgiddoni being

324
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:04,032
aware

325
00:02:04,032 --> 00:02:04,007
of

326
00:02:04,007 --> 00:02:03,982
their

327
00:02:03,982 --> 00:02:03,957
design, and

328
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:03,932
knowing

329
00:02:03,932 --> 00:02:03,907
of

330
00:02:03,907 --> 00:02:03,882
their

331
00:02:03,882 --> 00:02:03,857
weakness

332
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:03,832
because

333
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:03,807
of the

334
00:02:03,807 --> 00:02:03,782
want of

335
00:02:03,782 --> 00:02:03,757
food,

336
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:03,732
and the

337
00:02:03,732 --> 00:02:03,707
great

338
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:03,682


339
00:02:03,682 --> 00:02:03,657
slaughter which

340
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:03,632
had

341
00:02:03,632 --> 00:02:03,607
been made

342
00:02:03,607 --> 00:02:03,582
among

343
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:03,557
them,

344
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:03,532


345
00:02:03,532 --> 00:02:03,507
therefore he

346
00:02:03,507 --> 00:02:03,482
did send

347
00:02:03,482 --> 00:02:03,457
out his

348
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:03,432
armies

349
00:02:03,432 --> 00:02:03,407
in the

night-time,

352
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:03,332
and did

353
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:03,307
cut off

354
00:02:03,307 --> 00:02:03,282

retreat,

358
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:03,182
and did

359
00:02:03,182 --> 00:02:03,69
place his armies in the way of their retreat.

360
00:02:03,69 --> 00:02:03,72
25 And

361
00:02:03,72 --> 00:02:03,75
this

362
00:02:03,75 --> 00:02:03,78
did

363
00:02:03,78 --> 00:02:03,81

367
00:02:03,9 --> 00:02:03,93
and

368
00:02:03,93 --> 00:02:03,96
