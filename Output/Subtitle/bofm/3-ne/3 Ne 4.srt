Chapter 4 The Nephite armies defeat the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Gadianton robbers—Giddianhi is slain, and his

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
successor, Zemnarihah, is hanged—The Nephites praise

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:19:41,
the Lord for their victories. About A.D. 19–22. 

5
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:41,0
1 And it came to pass that in the latter

6
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:41,0
end of the eighteenth year those armies of

7
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:41,0
robbers had prepared for battle, and began

8
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:41,0
to come down and to sally forth from the

9
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:41,0
hills, and out of the mountains, and the

10
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:41,0
wilderness, and their strongholds, and

11
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:41,0
their secret places, and began to take

12
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:41,0
possession of the lands, both which were in the

13
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:41,0
land south and which were in the land

14
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:41,0
north, and began to take possession of all the

15
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:41,0
lands which had been deserted by the

16
00:19:41,0 --> 00:20:53,
Nephites, and the cities which had been left desolate.

17
00:20:53,0 --> 00:20:53,0
2 But behold, there were no wild

18
00:20:53,0 --> 00:20:53,0
beasts nor game in those lands

19
00:20:53,0 --> 00:20:53,0
which had been deserted by the

20
00:20:53,0 --> 00:20:53,0
Nephites, and there was no game for the

21
00:20:53,0 --> 00:22:05,
robbers save it were in the wilderness.

22
00:22:05,0 --> 00:22:05,0
3 And the robbers could not exist

23
00:22:05,0 --> 00:22:05,0
save it were in the wilderness,

24
00:22:05,0 --> 00:22:05,0
for the want of food; for the

25
00:22:05,0 --> 00:22:05,0
Nephites had left their lands

26
00:22:05,0 --> 00:22:05,0
desolate, and had gathered their flocks

27
00:22:05,0 --> 00:22:05,0
and their herds and all their

28
00:22:05,0 --> 00:21:37,
substance, and they were in one body.

29
00:21:37,0 --> 00:21:37,0
4 Therefore, there was no chance

30
00:21:37,0 --> 00:21:37,0
for the robbers to plunder and

31
00:21:37,0 --> 00:21:37,0
to obtain food, save it were to

32
00:21:37,0 --> 00:21:37,0
come up in open battle against

33
00:21:37,0 --> 00:21:37,0
the Nephites; and the Nephites

34
00:21:37,0 --> 00:21:37,0
being in one body, and having so

35
00:21:37,0 --> 00:21:37,0
great a number, and having

36
00:21:37,0 --> 00:21:37,0
reserved for themselves provisions,

37
00:21:37,0 --> 00:21:37,0
and horses and cattle, and flocks

38
00:21:37,0 --> 00:21:37,0
of every kind, that they might

39
00:21:37,0 --> 00:21:37,0
subsist for the space of seven

40
00:21:37,0 --> 00:21:37,0
years, in the which time they did

41
00:21:37,0 --> 00:21:37,0
hope to destroy the robbers from

42
00:21:37,0 --> 00:21:37,0
off the face of the land; and

43
00:21:37,0 --> 00:23:49,
thus the eighteenth year did pass away.

44
00:23:49,0 --> 00:23:49,0
5 And it came to pass that

45
00:23:49,0 --> 00:23:49,0
in the nineteenth year

46
00:23:49,0 --> 00:23:49,0
Giddianhi found that it was

47
00:23:49,0 --> 00:23:49,0
expedient that he should go up to

48
00:23:49,0 --> 00:23:49,0
battle against the Nephites,

49
00:23:49,0 --> 00:23:49,0
for there was no way that

50
00:23:49,0 --> 00:23:49,0
they could subsist save it

51
00:23:49,0 --> 00:23:21,
were to plunder and rob and murder.

52
00:23:21,0 --> 00:23:21,0
6 And they durst not spread

53
00:23:21,0 --> 00:23:21,0
themselves upon the face

54
00:23:21,0 --> 00:23:21,0
of the land insomuch that

55
00:23:21,0 --> 00:23:21,0
they could raise grain, lest

56
00:23:21,0 --> 00:23:21,0
the Nephites should come

57
00:23:21,0 --> 00:23:21,0
upon them and slay them;

58
00:23:21,0 --> 00:23:21,0
therefore Giddianhi gave

59
00:23:21,0 --> 00:23:21,0
commandment unto his armies that

60
00:23:21,0 --> 00:23:21,0
in this year they should go

61
00:23:21,0 --> 00:26:51,
up to battle against the Nephites.

62
00:26:51,0 --> 00:26:51,0
7 And it came to pass

63
00:26:51,0 --> 00:26:51,0
that they did come up to

64
00:26:51,0 --> 00:26:51,0
battle; and it was in the

65
00:26:51,0 --> 00:26:51,0
sixth month; and behold,

66
00:26:51,0 --> 00:26:51,0
great and terrible was the

67
00:26:51,0 --> 00:26:51,0
day that they did come up

68
00:26:51,0 --> 00:26:51,0
to battle; and they were

69
00:26:51,0 --> 00:26:51,0
girded about after the

70
00:26:51,0 --> 00:26:51,0
manner of robbers; and

71
00:26:51,0 --> 00:26:51,0
they had a lamb-skin about

72
00:26:51,0 --> 00:26:51,0
their loins, and they were

73
00:26:51,0 --> 00:26:51,0
dyed in blood, and their

74
00:26:51,0 --> 00:26:51,0
heads were shorn, and

75
00:26:51,0 --> 00:26:51,0
they had head-plates upon

76
00:26:51,0 --> 00:26:51,0
them; and great and

77
00:26:51,0 --> 00:26:51,0
terrible was the appearance of

78
00:26:51,0 --> 00:26:51,0
the armies of Giddianhi,

79
00:26:51,0 --> 00:26:51,0
because of their armor,

80
00:26:51,0 --> 00:26:23,
and because of their being dyed in blood.

81
00:26:23,0 --> 00:26:23,0
8 And it came to pass

82
00:26:23,0 --> 00:26:23,0
that the armies of the

83
00:26:23,0 --> 00:26:23,0
Nephites, when they saw

84
00:26:23,0 --> 00:26:23,0
the appearance of the

85
00:26:23,0 --> 00:26:23,0
army of Giddianhi, had

86
00:26:23,0 --> 00:26:23,0
all fallen to the earth,

87
00:26:23,0 --> 00:26:23,0
and did lift their

88
00:26:23,0 --> 00:26:23,0
cries to the Lord their

89
00:26:23,0 --> 00:26:23,0
God, that he would spare

90
00:26:23,0 --> 00:26:23,0
them and deliver them

91
00:26:23,0 --> 00:32:34,
out of the hands of their enemies.

92
00:32:34,0 --> 00:32:34,0
9 And it came to pass

93
00:32:34,0 --> 00:32:34,0
that when the armies

94
00:32:34,0 --> 00:32:34,0
of Giddianhi saw this

95
00:32:34,0 --> 00:32:34,0
they began to shout

96
00:32:34,0 --> 00:32:34,0
with a loud voice,

97
00:32:34,0 --> 00:32:34,0
because of their joy, for

98
00:32:34,0 --> 00:32:34,0
they had supposed that

99
00:32:34,0 --> 00:32:34,0
the Nephites had fallen

100
00:32:34,0 --> 00:32:34,0
with fear because of

101
00:32:34,0 --> 00:35:16,
the terror of their armies.

102
00:35:16,0 --> 00:35:16,0
10 But in this thing

103
00:35:16,0 --> 00:35:16,0
they were

104
00:35:16,0 --> 00:35:16,0
disappointed, for the Nephites

105
00:35:16,0 --> 00:35:16,0
did not fear them; but

106
00:35:16,0 --> 00:35:16,0
they did fear their

107
00:35:16,0 --> 00:35:16,0
God and did

108
00:35:16,0 --> 00:35:16,0
supplicate him for protection;

109
00:35:16,0 --> 00:35:16,0
therefore, when the

110
00:35:16,0 --> 00:35:16,0
armies of Giddianhi

111
00:35:16,0 --> 00:35:16,0
did rush upon them

112
00:35:16,0 --> 00:35:16,0
they were prepared to

113
00:35:16,0 --> 00:35:16,0
meet them; yea, in the

114
00:35:16,0 --> 00:35:16,0
strength of the Lord

115
00:35:16,0 --> 00:34:48,
they did receive them.

116
00:34:48,0 --> 00:34:48,0
11 And the battle

117
00:34:48,0 --> 00:34:48,0
commenced in this the

118
00:34:48,0 --> 00:34:48,0
sixth month; and

119
00:34:48,0 --> 00:34:48,0
great and terrible was

120
00:34:48,0 --> 00:34:48,0
the battle thereof,

121
00:34:48,0 --> 00:34:48,0
yea, great and

122
00:34:48,0 --> 00:34:48,0
terrible was the

123
00:34:48,0 --> 00:34:48,0
slaughter thereof, insomuch

124
00:34:48,0 --> 00:34:48,0
that there never was

125
00:34:48,0 --> 00:34:48,0
known so great a

126
00:34:48,0 --> 00:34:48,0
slaughter among all

127
00:34:48,0 --> 00:34:48,0
the people of Lehi

128
00:34:48,0 --> 00:41:29,
since he left Jerusalem.

129
00:41:29,0 --> 00:41:29,0
12 And

130
00:41:29,0 --> 00:41:29,0
notwithstanding the

131
00:41:29,0 --> 00:41:29,0
threatenings and the oaths

132
00:41:29,0 --> 00:41:29,0
which Giddianhi

133
00:41:29,0 --> 00:41:29,0
had made, behold,

134
00:41:29,0 --> 00:41:29,0
the Nephites did

135
00:41:29,0 --> 00:41:29,0
beat them, insomuch

136
00:41:29,0 --> 00:41:29,0
that they did fall

137
00:41:29,0 --> 00:41:43,
back from before them.

138
00:41:43,0 --> 00:41:43,0
13 And it came to

139
00:41:43,0 --> 00:41:43,0
pass that

140
00:41:43,0 --> 00:41:43,0
Gidgiddoni commanded

141
00:41:43,0 --> 00:41:43,0
that his armies

142
00:41:43,0 --> 00:41:43,0
should pursue them

143
00:41:43,0 --> 00:41:43,0
as far as the

144
00:41:43,0 --> 00:41:43,0
borders of the

145
00:41:43,0 --> 00:41:43,0
wilderness, and that

146
00:41:43,0 --> 00:41:43,0
they should not

147
00:41:43,0 --> 00:41:43,0
spare any that

148
00:41:43,0 --> 00:41:43,0
should fall into their

149
00:41:43,0 --> 00:41:43,0
hands by the

150
00:41:43,0 --> 00:41:43,0
way; and thus they

151
00:41:43,0 --> 00:41:43,0
did pursue them

152
00:41:43,0 --> 00:41:43,0
and did slay them,

153
00:41:43,0 --> 00:41:43,0
to the borders of

154
00:41:43,0 --> 00:41:43,0
the wilderness,

155
00:41:43,0 --> 00:41:43,0
even until they

156
00:41:43,0 --> 00:41:43,0
had fulfilled the

157
00:41:43,0 --> 00:42:41,
commandment of Gidgiddoni.

158
00:42:41,0 --> 00:42:41,0
14 And it came to

159
00:42:41,0 --> 00:42:41,0
pass that

160
00:42:41,0 --> 00:42:41,0
Giddianhi, who had

161
00:42:41,0 --> 00:42:41,0
stood and fought with

162
00:42:41,0 --> 00:42:41,0
boldness, was

163
00:42:41,0 --> 00:42:41,0
pursued as he fled;

164
00:42:41,0 --> 00:42:41,0
and being weary

165
00:42:41,0 --> 00:42:41,0
because of his

166
00:42:41,0 --> 00:42:41,0
much fighting he

167
00:42:41,0 --> 00:42:41,0
was overtaken and

168
00:42:41,0 --> 00:42:41,0
slain. And thus

169
00:42:41,0 --> 00:42:41,0
was the end of

170
00:42:41,0 --> 00:42:27,
Giddianhi the robber.

171
00:42:27,0 --> 00:42:27,0
15 And it came

172
00:42:27,0 --> 00:42:27,0
to pass that the

173
00:42:27,0 --> 00:42:27,0
armies of the

174
00:42:27,0 --> 00:42:27,0
Nephites did

175
00:42:27,0 --> 00:42:27,0
return again to their

176
00:42:27,0 --> 00:42:27,0
place of

177
00:42:27,0 --> 00:42:27,0
security. And it came

178
00:42:27,0 --> 00:42:27,0
to pass that

179
00:42:27,0 --> 00:42:27,0
this nineteenth

180
00:42:27,0 --> 00:42:27,0
year did pass away,

181
00:42:27,0 --> 00:42:27,0
and the robbers

182
00:42:27,0 --> 00:42:27,0
did not come

183
00:42:27,0 --> 00:42:27,0
again to battle;

184
00:42:27,0 --> 00:42:27,0
neither did they

185
00:42:27,0 --> 00:42:27,0
come again in

186
00:42:27,0 --> 00:46:11,
the twentieth year.

187
00:46:11,0 --> 00:46:11,0
16 And in the

188
00:46:11,0 --> 00:46:11,0
twenty and first

189
00:46:11,0 --> 00:46:11,0
year they did

190
00:46:11,0 --> 00:46:11,0
not come up to

191
00:46:11,0 --> 00:46:11,0
battle, but

192
00:46:11,0 --> 00:46:11,0
they came up on

193
00:46:11,0 --> 00:46:11,0
all sides to lay

194
00:46:11,0 --> 00:46:11,0
siege round

195
00:46:11,0 --> 00:46:11,0
about the people

196
00:46:11,0 --> 00:46:11,0
of Nephi; for

197
00:46:11,0 --> 00:46:11,0
they did suppose

198
00:46:11,0 --> 00:46:11,0
that if they

199
00:46:11,0 --> 00:46:11,0
should cut off

200
00:46:11,0 --> 00:46:11,0
the people of

201
00:46:11,0 --> 00:46:11,0
Nephi from their

202
00:46:11,0 --> 00:46:11,0
lands, and

203
00:46:11,0 --> 00:46:11,0
should hem them in

204
00:46:11,0 --> 00:46:11,0
on every side,

205
00:46:11,0 --> 00:46:11,0
and if they

206
00:46:11,0 --> 00:46:11,0
should cut them off

207
00:46:11,0 --> 00:46:11,0
from all their

208
00:46:11,0 --> 00:46:11,0
outward

209
00:46:11,0 --> 00:46:11,0
privileges, that they

210
00:46:11,0 --> 00:46:11,0
could cause

211
00:46:11,0 --> 00:46:11,0
them to yield

212
00:46:11,0 --> 00:45:43,
themselves up according to their wishes.

213
00:45:43,0 --> 00:45:43,0
17 Now they

214
00:45:43,0 --> 00:45:43,0
had appointed

215
00:45:43,0 --> 00:45:43,0
unto themselves

216
00:45:43,0 --> 00:45:43,0
another

217
00:45:43,0 --> 00:45:43,0
leader, whose name

218
00:45:43,0 --> 00:45:43,0
was Zemnarihah;

219
00:45:43,0 --> 00:45:43,0
therefore it

220
00:45:43,0 --> 00:45:43,0
was Zemnarihah

221
00:45:43,0 --> 00:45:43,0
that did

222
00:45:43,0 --> 00:45:43,0
cause that this

223
00:45:43,0 --> 00:49:13,
siege should take place.

224
00:49:13,0 --> 00:49:13,0
18 But

225
00:49:13,0 --> 00:49:13,0
behold, this was an

226
00:49:13,0 --> 00:49:13,0
advantage to

227
00:49:13,0 --> 00:49:13,0
the

228
00:49:13,0 --> 00:49:13,0
Nephites; for it was

229
00:49:13,0 --> 00:49:13,0
impossible

230
00:49:13,0 --> 00:49:13,0
for the robbers

231
00:49:13,0 --> 00:49:13,0
to lay siege

232
00:49:13,0 --> 00:49:13,0
sufficiently

233
00:49:13,0 --> 00:49:13,0
long to have

234
00:49:13,0 --> 00:49:13,0
any effect

235
00:49:13,0 --> 00:49:13,0
upon the

236
00:49:13,0 --> 00:49:13,0
Nephites, because

237
00:49:13,0 --> 00:49:13,0
of their much

238
00:49:13,0 --> 00:49:13,0
provision

239
00:49:13,0 --> 00:49:13,0
which they had

240
00:49:13,0 --> 00:48:45,
laid up in store,

241
00:48:45,0 --> 00:48:45,0
19 And

242
00:48:45,0 --> 00:48:45,0
because of the

243
00:48:45,0 --> 00:48:45,0
scantiness of

244
00:48:45,0 --> 00:48:45,0
provisions

245
00:48:45,0 --> 00:48:45,0
among the

246
00:48:45,0 --> 00:48:45,0
robbers; for

247
00:48:45,0 --> 00:48:45,0
behold, they

248
00:48:45,0 --> 00:48:45,0
had nothing

249
00:48:45,0 --> 00:48:45,0
save it were

250
00:48:45,0 --> 00:48:45,0
meat for

251
00:48:45,0 --> 00:48:45,0
their

252
00:48:45,0 --> 00:48:45,0
subsistence, which

253
00:48:45,0 --> 00:48:45,0
meat they did

254
00:48:45,0 --> 00:49:57,
obtain in the wilderness;

255
00:49:57,0 --> 00:49:57,0
20 And it

256
00:49:57,0 --> 00:49:57,0
came to pass

257
00:49:57,0 --> 00:49:57,0
that the

258
00:49:57,0 --> 00:49:57,0
wild game

259
00:49:57,0 --> 00:49:57,0
became scarce

260
00:49:57,0 --> 00:49:57,0
in the

261
00:49:57,0 --> 00:49:57,0
wilderness

262
00:49:57,0 --> 00:49:57,0
insomuch that

263
00:49:57,0 --> 00:49:57,0
the robbers

264
00:49:57,0 --> 00:49:57,0
were about

265
00:49:57,0 --> 00:49:57,0
to perish

266
00:49:57,0 --> 00:49:29,
with hunger.

267
00:49:29,0 --> 00:49:29,0
21 And the

268
00:49:29,0 --> 00:49:29,0
Nephites

269
00:49:29,0 --> 00:49:29,0
were

270
00:49:29,0 --> 00:49:29,0
continually

271
00:49:29,0 --> 00:49:29,0
marching out

272
00:49:29,0 --> 00:49:29,0
by day and

273
00:49:29,0 --> 00:49:29,0
by night,

274
00:49:29,0 --> 00:49:29,0
and

275
00:49:29,0 --> 00:49:29,0
falling upon

276
00:49:29,0 --> 00:49:29,0
their

277
00:49:29,0 --> 00:49:29,0
armies, and

278
00:49:29,0 --> 00:49:29,0
cutting them

279
00:49:29,0 --> 00:49:29,0
off by

280
00:49:29,0 --> 00:49:29,0
thousands and

281
00:49:29,0 --> 00:49:15,
by tens of thousands.

282
00:49:15,0 --> 00:49:15,0
22 And

283
00:49:15,0 --> 00:49:15,0
thus it

284
00:49:15,0 --> 00:49:15,0
became the

285
00:49:15,0 --> 00:49:15,0
desire of

286
00:49:15,0 --> 00:49:15,0
the

287
00:49:15,0 --> 00:49:15,0
people of

288
00:49:15,0 --> 00:49:15,0
Zemnarihah to

289
00:49:15,0 --> 00:49:15,0
withdraw

290
00:49:15,0 --> 00:49:15,0
from

291
00:49:15,0 --> 00:49:15,0
their

292
00:49:15,0 --> 00:49:15,0
design, because

293
00:49:15,0 --> 00:49:15,0
of the

294
00:49:15,0 --> 00:49:15,0
great

295
00:49:15,0 --> 00:49:15,0
destruction

296
00:49:15,0 --> 00:49:15,0
which came

297
00:49:15,0 --> 00:49:15,0
upon

298
00:49:15,0 --> 00:50:27,
them by night and by day.

299
00:50:27,0 --> 00:50:27,0
23 And

300
00:50:27,0 --> 00:50:27,0
it came

301
00:50:27,0 --> 00:50:27,0
to pass

302
00:50:27,0 --> 00:50:27,0
that

303
00:50:27,0 --> 00:50:27,0
Zemnarihah

304
00:50:27,0 --> 00:50:27,0
did give

305
00:50:27,0 --> 00:50:27,0
command

306
00:50:27,0 --> 00:50:27,0
unto his

307
00:50:27,0 --> 00:50:27,0
people

308
00:50:27,0 --> 00:50:27,0
that

309
00:50:27,0 --> 00:50:27,0
they should

310
00:50:27,0 --> 00:50:27,0


311
00:50:27,0 --> 00:50:27,0
withdraw

312
00:50:27,0 --> 00:50:27,0
themselves

313
00:50:27,0 --> 00:50:27,0
from the

314
00:50:27,0 --> 00:50:27,0
siege, and

315
00:50:27,0 --> 00:50:27,0
march

316
00:50:27,0 --> 00:50:27,0
into the

317
00:50:27,0 --> 00:50:27,0


318
00:50:27,0 --> 00:50:27,0
furthermost

319
00:50:27,0 --> 00:55:37,
parts of the land northward.

320
00:55:37,0 --> 00:55:37,0
24 And

321
00:55:37,0 --> 00:55:37,0
now,

322
00:55:37,0 --> 00:55:37,0


323
00:55:37,0 --> 00:55:37,0
Gidgiddoni being

324
00:55:37,0 --> 00:55:37,0
aware

325
00:55:37,0 --> 00:55:37,0
of

326
00:55:37,0 --> 00:55:37,0
their

327
00:55:37,0 --> 00:55:37,0
design, and

328
00:55:37,0 --> 00:55:37,0
knowing

329
00:55:37,0 --> 00:55:37,0
of

330
00:55:37,0 --> 00:55:37,0
their

331
00:55:37,0 --> 00:55:37,0
weakness

332
00:55:37,0 --> 00:55:37,0
because

333
00:55:37,0 --> 00:55:37,0
of the

334
00:55:37,0 --> 00:55:37,0
want of

335
00:55:37,0 --> 00:55:37,0
food,

336
00:55:37,0 --> 00:55:37,0
and the

337
00:55:37,0 --> 00:55:37,0
great

338
00:55:37,0 --> 00:55:37,0


339
00:55:37,0 --> 00:55:37,0
slaughter which

340
00:55:37,0 --> 00:55:37,0
had

341
00:55:37,0 --> 00:55:37,0
been made

342
00:55:37,0 --> 00:55:37,0
among

343
00:55:37,0 --> 00:55:37,0
them,

344
00:55:37,0 --> 00:55:37,0


345
00:55:37,0 --> 00:55:37,0
therefore he

346
00:55:37,0 --> 00:55:37,0
did send

347
00:55:37,0 --> 00:55:37,0
out his

348
00:55:37,0 --> 00:55:37,0
armies

349
00:55:37,0 --> 00:55:37,0
in the

350
00:55:37,0 --> 00:55:37,0


351
00:55:37,0 --> 00:55:37,0
night-time,

352
00:55:37,0 --> 00:55:37,0
and did

353
00:55:37,0 --> 00:55:37,0
cut off

354
00:55:37,0 --> 00:55:37,0
the

355
00:55:37,0 --> 00:55:37,0
way of

356
00:55:37,0 --> 00:55:37,0
their

357
00:55:37,0 --> 00:55:37,0
retreat,

358
00:55:37,0 --> 00:55:37,0
and did

359
00:55:37,0 --> 00:55:09,
place his armies in the way of their retreat.

360
00:55:09,0 --> 00:55:09,0
25 And

361
00:55:09,0 --> 00:55:09,0
this

362
00:55:09,0 --> 00:55:09,0
did

363
00:55:09,0 --> 00:55:09,0
they do

364
00:55:09,0 --> 00:55:09,0
in the

367
00:55:09,0 --> 00:55:09,0
and

368
00:55:09,0 --> 00:55:09,0
got on

00:55:09,0 --> 00:55:09,0
their

370
00:55:09,0 --> 00:55:09,0

00:55:09,0 --> 00:55:09,0
morrow,

378
00:55:09,0 --> 00:55:09,0
when

379

00:55:09,0 --> 00:55:09,0
they

385
00:55:09,0 --> 00:55:09,0
were

386
00:55:09,0 --> 00:55:09,0
met by

387
