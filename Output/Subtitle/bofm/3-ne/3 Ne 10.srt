00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 10 There is silence in the land

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
for many hours—The voice of Christ promises

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
to gather His people as a hen gathers her

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
chickens—The more righteous part of the

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:14:39,
people have been preserved. About A.D. 34–35. 

6
00:14:39,0 --> 00:14:39,0
1 And now behold, it came to pass that

7
00:14:39,0 --> 00:14:39,0
all the people of the land did hear

8
00:14:39,0 --> 00:14:39,0
these sayings, and did witness of it. And

9
00:14:39,0 --> 00:14:39,0
after these sayings there was silence

10
00:14:39,0 --> 00:16:51,
in the land for the space of many hours;

11
00:16:51,0 --> 00:16:51,0
2 For so great was the astonishment

12
00:16:51,0 --> 00:16:51,0
of the people that they did cease

13
00:16:51,0 --> 00:16:51,0
lamenting and howling for the loss of

14
00:16:51,0 --> 00:16:51,0
their kindred which had been slain;

15
00:16:51,0 --> 00:16:51,0
therefore there was silence in all

16
00:16:51,0 --> 00:18:03,
the land for the space of many hours.

17
00:18:03,0 --> 00:18:03,0
3 And it came to pass that there

18
00:18:03,0 --> 00:18:03,0
came a voice again unto the

19
00:18:03,0 --> 00:18:03,0
people, and all the people did

20
00:18:03,0 --> 00:19:15,
hear, and did witness of it, saying:

21
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
4 O ye people of these great

22
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
cities which have fallen, who are

23
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
descendants of Jacob, yea, who

24
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
are of the house of Israel,

25
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
how oft have I gathered you as a

26
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
hen gathereth her chickens

27
00:19:15,0 --> 00:18:47,
under her wings, and have nourished you.

28
00:18:47,0 --> 00:18:47,0
5 And again, how oft would I

29
00:18:47,0 --> 00:18:47,0
have gathered you as a hen

30
00:18:47,0 --> 00:18:47,0
gathereth her chickens under her

31
00:18:47,0 --> 00:18:47,0
wings, yea, O ye people of the

32
00:18:47,0 --> 00:18:47,0
house of Israel, who have

33
00:18:47,0 --> 00:18:47,0
fallen; yea, O ye people of the

34
00:18:47,0 --> 00:18:47,0
house of Israel, ye that dwell

35
00:18:47,0 --> 00:18:47,0
at Jerusalem, as ye that have

36
00:18:47,0 --> 00:18:47,0
fallen; yea, how oft would I

37
00:18:47,0 --> 00:18:47,0
have gathered you as a hen

38
00:18:47,0 --> 00:18:19,
gathereth her chickens, and ye would not.

39
00:18:19,0 --> 00:18:19,0
6 O ye house of Israel

40
00:18:19,0 --> 00:18:19,0
whom I have spared, how oft

41
00:18:19,0 --> 00:18:19,0
will I gather you as a hen

42
00:18:19,0 --> 00:18:19,0
gathereth her chickens

43
00:18:19,0 --> 00:18:19,0
under her wings, if ye will

44
00:18:19,0 --> 00:18:19,0
repent and return unto me

45
00:18:19,0 --> 00:19:31,
with full purpose of heart.

46
00:19:31,0 --> 00:19:31,0
7 But if not, O house of

47
00:19:31,0 --> 00:19:31,0
Israel, the places of

48
00:19:31,0 --> 00:19:31,0
your dwellings shall

49
00:19:31,0 --> 00:19:31,0
become desolate until the

50
00:19:31,0 --> 00:19:31,0
time of the fulfilling of

51
00:19:31,0 --> 00:21:43,
the covenant to your fathers.

52
00:21:43,0 --> 00:21:43,0
8 And now it came to

53
00:21:43,0 --> 00:21:43,0
pass that after the

54
00:21:43,0 --> 00:21:43,0
people had heard these

55
00:21:43,0 --> 00:21:43,0
words, behold, they began to

56
00:21:43,0 --> 00:21:43,0
weep and howl again

57
00:21:43,0 --> 00:21:43,0
because of the loss of

58
00:21:43,0 --> 00:21:15,
their kindred and friends.

59
00:21:15,0 --> 00:21:15,0
9 And it came to pass

60
00:21:15,0 --> 00:21:15,0
that thus did the

61
00:21:15,0 --> 00:21:15,0
three days pass away. And

62
00:21:15,0 --> 00:21:15,0
it was in the morning,

63
00:21:15,0 --> 00:21:15,0
and the darkness

64
00:21:15,0 --> 00:21:15,0
dispersed from off the

65
00:21:15,0 --> 00:21:15,0
face of the land, and the

66
00:21:15,0 --> 00:21:15,0
earth did cease to

67
00:21:15,0 --> 00:21:15,0
tremble, and the rocks

68
00:21:15,0 --> 00:21:15,0
did cease to rend, and

69
00:21:15,0 --> 00:21:15,0
the dreadful groanings

70
00:21:15,0 --> 00:21:15,0
did cease, and all

71
00:21:15,0 --> 00:20:47,
the tumultuous noises did pass away.

72
00:20:47,0 --> 00:20:47,0
10 And the earth did

73
00:20:47,0 --> 00:20:47,0
cleave together

74
00:20:47,0 --> 00:20:47,0
again, that it stood; and

75
00:20:47,0 --> 00:20:47,0
the mourning, and the

76
00:20:47,0 --> 00:20:47,0
weeping, and the

77
00:20:47,0 --> 00:20:47,0
wailing of the people

78
00:20:47,0 --> 00:20:47,0
who were spared alive

79
00:20:47,0 --> 00:20:47,0
did cease; and their

80
00:20:47,0 --> 00:20:47,0
mourning was turned

81
00:20:47,0 --> 00:20:47,0
into joy, and their

82
00:20:47,0 --> 00:20:47,0
lamentations into the

83
00:20:47,0 --> 00:20:47,0
praise and thanksgiving

84
00:20:47,0 --> 00:20:47,0
unto the Lord Jesus

85
00:20:47,0 --> 00:21:59,
Christ, their Redeemer.

86
00:21:59,0 --> 00:21:59,0
11 And thus far were

87
00:21:59,0 --> 00:21:59,0
the scriptures

88
00:21:59,0 --> 00:21:59,0
fulfilled which had been

89
00:21:59,0 --> 00:21:31,
spoken by the prophets.

90
00:21:31,0 --> 00:21:31,0
12 And it was the

91
00:21:31,0 --> 00:21:31,0
more righteous part of

92
00:21:31,0 --> 00:21:31,0
the people who were

93
00:21:31,0 --> 00:21:31,0
saved, and it was

94
00:21:31,0 --> 00:21:31,0
they who received the

95
00:21:31,0 --> 00:21:31,0
prophets and stoned

96
00:21:31,0 --> 00:21:31,0
them not; and it

97
00:21:31,0 --> 00:21:31,0
was they who had not

98
00:21:31,0 --> 00:21:31,0
shed the blood of the

99
00:21:31,0 --> 00:26:41,
saints, who were spared—

100
00:26:41,0 --> 00:26:41,0
13 And they were

101
00:26:41,0 --> 00:26:41,0
spared and were not

102
00:26:41,0 --> 00:26:41,0
sunk and buried up

103
00:26:41,0 --> 00:26:41,0
in the earth; and

104
00:26:41,0 --> 00:26:41,0
they were not drowned

105
00:26:41,0 --> 00:26:41,0
in the depths of

106
00:26:41,0 --> 00:26:41,0
the sea; and they

107
00:26:41,0 --> 00:26:41,0
were not burned by

108
00:26:41,0 --> 00:26:41,0
fire, neither were

109
00:26:41,0 --> 00:26:41,0
they fallen upon and

110
00:26:41,0 --> 00:26:41,0
crushed to death;

111
00:26:41,0 --> 00:26:41,0
and they were not

112
00:26:41,0 --> 00:26:41,0
carried away in the

113
00:26:41,0 --> 00:26:41,0
whirlwind; neither

114
00:26:41,0 --> 00:26:41,0
were they

115
00:26:41,0 --> 00:26:41,0
overpowered by the vapor of

116
00:26:41,0 --> 00:26:13,
smoke and of darkness.

117
00:26:13,0 --> 00:26:13,0
14 And now, whoso

118
00:26:13,0 --> 00:26:13,0
readeth, let him

119
00:26:13,0 --> 00:26:13,0
understand; he that

120
00:26:13,0 --> 00:26:13,0
hath the

121
00:26:13,0 --> 00:26:13,0
scriptures, let him search

122
00:26:13,0 --> 00:26:13,0
them, and see and

123
00:26:13,0 --> 00:26:13,0
behold if all

124
00:26:13,0 --> 00:26:13,0
these deaths and

125
00:26:13,0 --> 00:26:13,0
destructions by fire,

126
00:26:13,0 --> 00:26:13,0
and by smoke, and

127
00:26:13,0 --> 00:26:13,0
by tempests, and

128
00:26:13,0 --> 00:26:13,0
by whirlwinds, and

129
00:26:13,0 --> 00:26:13,0
by the opening of

130
00:26:13,0 --> 00:26:13,0
the earth to

131
00:26:13,0 --> 00:26:13,0
receive them, and all

132
00:26:13,0 --> 00:26:13,0
these things are

133
00:26:13,0 --> 00:26:13,0
not unto the

134
00:26:13,0 --> 00:26:13,0
fulfilling of the

135
00:26:13,0 --> 00:25:45,
prophecies of many of the holy prophets.

136
00:25:45,0 --> 00:25:45,0
15 Behold, I say

137
00:25:45,0 --> 00:25:45,0
unto you, Yea,

138
00:25:45,0 --> 00:25:45,0
many have

139
00:25:45,0 --> 00:25:45,0
testified of these

140
00:25:45,0 --> 00:25:45,0
things at the

141
00:25:45,0 --> 00:25:45,0
coming of Christ, and

142
00:25:45,0 --> 00:25:45,0
were slain

143
00:25:45,0 --> 00:25:45,0
because they

144
00:25:45,0 --> 00:33:57,
testified of these things.

145
00:33:57,0 --> 00:33:57,0
16 Yea, the

146
00:33:57,0 --> 00:33:57,0
prophet Zenos did

147
00:33:57,0 --> 00:33:57,0
testify of

148
00:33:57,0 --> 00:33:57,0
these things, and

149
00:33:57,0 --> 00:33:57,0
also Zenock

150
00:33:57,0 --> 00:33:57,0
spake concerning

151
00:33:57,0 --> 00:33:57,0
these things,

152
00:33:57,0 --> 00:33:57,0
because they

153
00:33:57,0 --> 00:33:57,0
testified

154
00:33:57,0 --> 00:33:57,0
particularly concerning

155
00:33:57,0 --> 00:33:57,0
us, who are the

156
00:33:57,0 --> 00:37:27,
remnant of their seed.

157
00:37:27,0 --> 00:37:27,0
17 Behold, our

158
00:37:27,0 --> 00:37:27,0
father Jacob

159
00:37:27,0 --> 00:37:27,0
also testified

160
00:37:27,0 --> 00:37:27,0
concerning a

161
00:37:27,0 --> 00:37:27,0
remnant of the

162
00:37:27,0 --> 00:37:27,0
seed of

163
00:37:27,0 --> 00:37:27,0
Joseph. And behold,

164
00:37:27,0 --> 00:37:27,0
are not we a

165
00:37:27,0 --> 00:37:27,0
remnant of the

166
00:37:27,0 --> 00:37:27,0
seed of

167
00:37:27,0 --> 00:37:27,0
Joseph? And these

168
00:37:27,0 --> 00:37:27,0
things which

169
00:37:27,0 --> 00:37:27,0
testify of us,

170
00:37:27,0 --> 00:37:27,0
are they not

171
00:37:27,0 --> 00:37:27,0
written upon the

172
00:37:27,0 --> 00:37:27,0
plates of

173
00:37:27,0 --> 00:37:27,0
brass which our

174
00:37:27,0 --> 00:37:27,0
father Lehi

175
00:37:27,0 --> 00:39:39,
brought out of Jerusalem?

176
00:39:39,0 --> 00:39:39,0
18 And it

177
00:39:39,0 --> 00:39:39,0
came to pass

178
00:39:39,0 --> 00:39:39,0
that in the

179
00:39:39,0 --> 00:39:39,0
ending of the

180
00:39:39,0 --> 00:39:39,0
thirty and

181
00:39:39,0 --> 00:39:39,0
fourth year,

182
00:39:39,0 --> 00:39:39,0
behold, I will

183
00:39:39,0 --> 00:39:39,0
show unto you

184
00:39:39,0 --> 00:39:39,0
that the people

185
00:39:39,0 --> 00:39:39,0
of Nephi who

186
00:39:39,0 --> 00:39:39,0
were spared,

187
00:39:39,0 --> 00:39:39,0
and also

188
00:39:39,0 --> 00:39:39,0
those who had

189
00:39:39,0 --> 00:39:39,0
been called

190
00:39:39,0 --> 00:39:39,0
Lamanites, who

191
00:39:39,0 --> 00:39:39,0
had been

192
00:39:39,0 --> 00:39:39,0
spared, did have

193
00:39:39,0 --> 00:39:39,0
great favors

194
00:39:39,0 --> 00:39:39,0
shown unto

195
00:39:39,0 --> 00:39:39,0
them, and great

196
00:39:39,0 --> 00:39:39,0
blessings

197
00:39:39,0 --> 00:39:39,0
poured out upon

198
00:39:39,0 --> 00:39:39,0
their heads,

199
00:39:39,0 --> 00:39:39,0
insomuch that

200
00:39:39,0 --> 00:39:39,0
soon after

201
00:39:39,0 --> 00:39:39,0
the ascension

202
00:39:39,0 --> 00:39:39,0
of Christ

203
00:39:39,0 --> 00:39:39,0
into heaven he

204
00:39:39,0 --> 00:41:51,
did truly manifest himself unto them—

205
00:41:51,0 --> 00:41:51,0
19 Showing

206
00:41:51,0 --> 00:41:51,0
his body unto

207
00:41:51,0 --> 00:41:51,0
them, and

208
00:41:51,0 --> 00:41:51,0
ministering

209
00:41:51,0 --> 00:41:51,0
unto them;

210
00:41:51,0 --> 00:41:51,0
and an account

211
00:41:51,0 --> 00:41:51,0
of his

212
00:41:51,0 --> 00:41:51,0
ministry shall

213
00:41:51,0 --> 00:41:51,0
be given

214
00:41:51,0 --> 00:41:51,0
hereafter.

215
00:41:51,0 --> 00:41:51,0
Therefore for

216
00:41:51,0 --> 00:41:51,0
this time I

217
00:41:51,0 --> 00:45:21,
make an end of my sayings.
