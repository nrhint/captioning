00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,4
Chapter 10 There is silence in the land for many

2
00:00:01,4 --> 00:00:02,8
 hours—The voice of Christ promises to gather His

3
00:00:02,8 --> 00:00:04,2
 people as a hen gathers her chickens—The more

4
00:00:04,2 --> 00:00:05,6
 righteous part of the people have been preserved. About

5
00:00:05,6 --> 00:00:07,0
 A.D. 34–35.

6
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,975
1 And now behold, it came to pass that all the

7
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:11,975
 people of the land did hear these sayings, and did

8
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:13,975
 witness of it. And after these sayings there was

9
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:15,975
 silence in the land for the space of many hours

10
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,549
2 For so great was the astonishment of the people

11
00:00:17,549 --> 00:00:19,149
 that they did cease lamenting and howling for the

12
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:20,749
 loss of their kindred which had been slain;

13
00:00:20,749 --> 00:00:22,349
 therefore there was silence in all the land for the

14
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:23,949
 space of many hours

15
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:24,257
3 And it came to pass that there came a voice

16
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:24,59
 again unto the people, and all the people did hear,

17
00:00:24,59 --> 00:00:24,923
 and did witness of it, saying

18
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:25,924
4 O ye people of these great cities which have

19
00:00:25,924 --> 00:00:27,524
 fallen, who are descendants of Jacob, yea, who are of

20
00:00:27,524 --> 00:00:29,124
 the house of Israel, how oft have I gathered you

21
00:00:29,124 --> 00:00:30,724
 as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings,

22
00:00:30,724 --> 00:00:32,324
 and have nourished you

23
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:33,442
5 And again, how oft would I have gathered you as

24
00:00:33,442 --> 00:00:34,585
 a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, yea,

25
00:00:34,585 --> 00:00:35,728
 O ye people of the house of Israel, who have

26
00:00:35,728 --> 00:00:36,871
 fallen; yea, O ye people of the house of Israel, ye

27
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:38,014
 that dwell at Jerusalem, as ye that have fallen;

28
00:00:38,014 --> 00:00:39,157
 yea, how oft would I have gathered you as a hen

29
00:00:39,157 --> 00:00:40,3
 gathereth her chickens, and ye would not

30
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:42,274
6 O ye house of Israel whom I have spared, how oft

31
00:00:42,274 --> 00:00:44,274
 will I gather you as a hen gathereth her chickens

32
00:00:44,274 --> 00:00:46,274
 under her wings, if ye will repent and return

33
00:00:46,274 --> 00:00:48,274
 unto me with full purpose of heart

34
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:50,915
7 But if not, O house of Israel, the places of

35
00:00:50,915 --> 00:00:53,582
 your dwellings shall become desolate until the time

36
00:00:53,582 --> 00:00:56,249
 of the fulfilling of the covenant to your fathers

37
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:58,223
8 And now it came to pass that after the people

38
00:00:58,223 --> 00:01:00,223
 had heard these words, behold, they began to weep

39
00:01:00,223 --> 00:01:02,223
 and howl again because of the loss of their kindred

40
00:01:02,223 --> 00:01:04,223
 and friends

41
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:05,53
9 And it came to pass that thus did the three days

42
00:01:05,53 --> 00:01:06,863
 pass away. And it was in the morning, and the

43
00:01:06,863 --> 00:01:08,196
 darkness dispersed from off the face of the land, and

44
00:01:08,196 --> 00:01:09,529
 the earth did cease to tremble, and the rocks did

45
00:01:09,529 --> 00:01:10,862
 cease to rend, and the dreadful groanings did

46
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:12,195
 cease, and all the tumultuous noises did pass away

47
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:13,505
10 And the earth did cleave together again, that

48
00:01:13,505 --> 00:01:14,838
 it stood; and the mourning, and the weeping, and

49
00:01:14,838 --> 00:01:16,171
 the wailing of the people who were spared alive did

50
00:01:16,171 --> 00:01:17,504
 cease; and their mourning was turned into joy, and

51
00:01:17,504 --> 00:01:18,837
 their lamentations into the praise and

52
00:01:18,837 --> 00:01:20,17
 thanksgiving unto the Lord Jesus Christ, their Redeemer

53
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:24,147
11 And thus far were the scriptures fulfilled

54
00:01:24,147 --> 00:01:28,147
 which had been spoken by the prophets

55
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:29,721
12 And it was the more righteous part of the

56
00:01:29,721 --> 00:01:31,321
 people who were saved, and it was they who received the

57
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:32,921
 prophets and stoned them not; and it was they who

58
00:01:32,921 --> 00:01:34,521
 had not shed the blood of the saints, who were

59
00:01:34,521 --> 00:01:36,121
 spared

60
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,239
13 And they were spared and were not sunk and

61
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:38,382
 buried up in the earth; and they were not drowned in

62
00:01:38,382 --> 00:01:39,525
 the depths of the sea; and they were not burned by

63
00:01:39,525 --> 00:01:40,668
 fire, neither were they fallen upon and crushed to

64
00:01:40,668 --> 00:01:41,811
 death; and they were not carried away in the

65
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:42,954
 whirlwind; neither were they overpowered by the vapor

66
00:01:42,954 --> 00:01:44,097
 of smoke and of darkness

67
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:45,071
14 And now, whoso readeth, let him understand; he

68
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:46,071
 that hath the scriptures, let him search them, and

69
00:01:46,071 --> 00:01:47,071
 see and behold if all these deaths and

70
00:01:47,071 --> 00:01:48,071
 destructions by fire, and by smoke, and by tempests, and by

71
00:01:48,071 --> 00:01:49,071
 whirlwinds, and by the opening of the earth to

72
00:01:49,071 --> 00:01:50,071
 receive them, and all these things are not unto the

73
00:01:50,071 --> 00:01:51,071
 fulfilling of the prophecies of many of the holy

74
00:01:51,071 --> 00:01:52,071
 prophets

75
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:54,712
15 Behold, I say unto you, Yea, many have

76
00:01:54,712 --> 00:01:57,379
 testified of these things at the coming of Christ, and

77
00:01:57,379 --> 00:02:00,046
 were slain because they testified of these things

78
00:02:00,02 --> 00:02:03,77
16 Yea, the prophet Zenos did testify of these

79
00:02:03,77 --> 00:02:07,52
 things, and also Zenock spake concerning these

80
00:02:07,52 --> 00:02:11,27
 things, because they testified particularly concerning

81
00:02:11,27 --> 00:02:15,02
 us, who are the remnant of their seed

82
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,636
17 Behold, our father Jacob also testified

83
00:02:18,636 --> 00:02:21,303
 concerning a remnant of the seed of Joseph. And behold,

84
00:02:21,303 --> 00:02:23,97
 are not we a remnant of the seed of Joseph? And

85
00:02:23,97 --> 00:02:26,637
 these things which testify of us, are they not

86
00:02:26,637 --> 00:02:29,304
 written upon the plates of brass which our father Lehi

87
00:02:29,304 --> 00:02:31,971
 brought out of Jerusalem

88
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:32,807
18 And it came to pass that in the ending of the

89
00:02:32,807 --> 00:02:33,696
 thirty and fourth year, behold, I will show unto

90
00:02:33,696 --> 00:02:34,585
 you that the people of Nephi who were spared, and

91
00:02:34,585 --> 00:02:35,474
 also those who had been called Lamanites, who had

92
00:02:35,474 --> 00:02:36,363
 been spared, did have great favors shown unto them,

93
00:02:36,363 --> 00:02:37,252
 and great blessings poured out upon their heads,

94
00:02:37,252 --> 00:02:38,141
 insomuch that soon after the ascension of Christ

95
00:02:38,141 --> 00:02:39,03
 into heaven he did truly manifest himself unto them

96
00:02:39,03 --> 00:02:39,919


97
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:40,143
19 Showing his body unto them, and ministering

98
00:02:40,143 --> 00:02:40,393
 unto them; and an account of his ministry shall be

99
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:40,643
 given hereafter. Therefore for this time I make an

100
00:02:40,643 --> 00:02:40,893
 end of my sayings.
