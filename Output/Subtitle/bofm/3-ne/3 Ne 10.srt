00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:04,4
Chapter 10 There is silence in the land

2
00:00:04,4 --> 00:00:08,8
for many hours—The voice of Christ promises

3
00:00:08,8 --> 00:00:13,2
to gather His people as a hen gathers her

4
00:00:13,2 --> 00:00:17,6
chickens—The more righteous part of the

5
00:00:17,6 --> 00:00:22,256
people have been preserved. About A.D. 34–35. 

6
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:25,256
1 And now behold, it came to pass that

7
00:00:25,256 --> 00:00:28,256
all the people of the land did hear

8
00:00:28,256 --> 00:00:31,256
these sayings, and did witness of it. And

9
00:00:31,256 --> 00:00:34,256
after these sayings there was silence

10
00:00:34,256 --> 00:00:37,271
in the land for the space of many hours;

11
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:37,938
2 For so great was the astonishment

12
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:38,605
of the people that they did cease

13
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:39,272
lamenting and howling for the loss of

14
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:39,939
their kindred which had been slain;

15
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:40,606
therefore there was silence in all

16
00:00:40,606 --> 00:00:41,675
the land for the space of many hours.

17
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:45,175
3 And it came to pass that there

18
00:00:45,175 --> 00:00:48,675
came a voice again unto the

19
00:00:48,675 --> 00:00:52,175
people, and all the people did

20
00:00:52,175 --> 00:00:55,989
hear, and did witness of it, saying:

21
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:57,132
4 O ye people of these great

22
00:00:57,132 --> 00:00:58,275
cities which have fallen, who are

23
00:00:58,275 --> 00:00:59,418
descendants of Jacob, yea, who

24
00:00:59,418 --> 00:01:00,561
are of the house of Israel,

25
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:01,704
how oft have I gathered you as a

26
00:01:01,704 --> 00:01:02,847
hen gathereth her chickens

27
00:01:02,847 --> 00:01:03,03
under her wings, and have nourished you.

28
00:01:03,03 --> 00:01:03,394
5 And again, how oft would I

29
00:01:03,394 --> 00:01:03,758
have gathered you as a hen

30
00:01:03,758 --> 00:01:04,122
gathereth her chickens under her

31
00:01:04,122 --> 00:01:04,486
wings, yea, O ye people of the

32
00:01:04,486 --> 00:01:04,85
house of Israel, who have

33
00:01:04,85 --> 00:01:05,214
fallen; yea, O ye people of the

34
00:01:05,214 --> 00:01:05,578
house of Israel, ye that dwell

35
00:01:05,578 --> 00:01:05,942
at Jerusalem, as ye that have

36
00:01:05,942 --> 00:01:06,306
fallen; yea, how oft would I

37
00:01:06,306 --> 00:01:06,67
have gathered you as a hen

38
00:01:06,67 --> 00:01:07,434
gathereth her chickens, and ye would not.

39
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:09,148
6 O ye house of Israel

40
00:01:09,148 --> 00:01:10,862
whom I have spared, how oft

41
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:12,576
will I gather you as a hen

42
00:01:12,576 --> 00:01:14,29
gathereth her chickens

43
00:01:14,29 --> 00:01:16,004
under her wings, if ye will

44
00:01:16,004 --> 00:01:17,718
repent and return unto me

45
00:01:17,718 --> 00:01:19,78
with full purpose of heart.

46
00:01:19,78 --> 00:01:22,113
7 But if not, O house of

47
00:01:22,113 --> 00:01:24,446
Israel, the places of

48
00:01:24,446 --> 00:01:26,779
your dwellings shall

49
00:01:26,779 --> 00:01:29,112
become desolate until the

50
00:01:29,112 --> 00:01:31,445
time of the fulfilling of

51
00:01:31,445 --> 00:01:33,16
the covenant to your fathers.

52
00:01:33,16 --> 00:01:33,731
8 And now it came to

53
00:01:33,731 --> 00:01:34,302
pass that after the

54
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:34,873
people had heard these

55
00:01:34,873 --> 00:01:35,444
words, behold, they began to

56
00:01:35,444 --> 00:01:36,015
weep and howl again

57
00:01:36,015 --> 00:01:36,586
because of the loss of

58
00:01:36,586 --> 00:01:37,564
their kindred and friends.

59
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:37,641
9 And it came to pass

60
00:01:37,641 --> 00:01:37,718
that thus did the

61
00:01:37,718 --> 00:01:37,795
three days pass away. And

62
00:01:37,795 --> 00:01:37,872
it was in the morning,

63
00:01:37,872 --> 00:01:37,949
and the darkness

64
00:01:37,949 --> 00:01:38,026
dispersed from off the

65
00:01:38,026 --> 00:01:38,103
face of the land, and the

66
00:01:38,103 --> 00:01:38,18
earth did cease to

67
00:01:38,18 --> 00:01:38,257
tremble, and the rocks

68
00:01:38,257 --> 00:01:38,334
did cease to rend, and

69
00:01:38,334 --> 00:01:38,411
the dreadful groanings

70
00:01:38,411 --> 00:01:38,488
did cease, and all

71
00:01:38,488 --> 00:01:38,031
the tumultuous noises did pass away.

72
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:37,96
10 And the earth did

73
00:01:37,96 --> 00:01:37,889
cleave together

74
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:37,818
again, that it stood; and

75
00:01:37,818 --> 00:01:37,747
the mourning, and the

76
00:01:37,747 --> 00:01:37,676
weeping, and the

77
00:01:37,676 --> 00:01:37,605
wailing of the people

78
00:01:37,605 --> 00:01:37,534
who were spared alive

79
00:01:37,534 --> 00:01:37,463
did cease; and their

80
00:01:37,463 --> 00:01:37,392
mourning was turned

81
00:01:37,392 --> 00:01:37,321
into joy, and their

82
00:01:37,321 --> 00:01:37,25
lamentations into the

83
00:01:37,25 --> 00:01:37,179
praise and thanksgiving

84
00:01:37,179 --> 00:01:37,108
unto the Lord Jesus

85
00:01:37,108 --> 00:01:37,097
Christ, their Redeemer.

86
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,097
11 And thus far were

87
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:39,097
the scriptures

88
00:01:39,097 --> 00:01:40,097
fulfilled which had been

89
00:01:40,097 --> 00:01:41,501
spoken by the prophets.

90
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:41,401
12 And it was the

91
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:41,301
more righteous part of

92
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:41,201
the people who were

93
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:41,101
saved, and it was

94
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:41,001
they who received the

95
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:40,901
prophets and stoned

96
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:40,801
them not; and it

97
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:40,701
was they who had not

98
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:40,601
shed the blood of the

99
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:40,567
saints, who were spared—

100
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:40,508
13 And they were

101
00:01:40,508 --> 00:01:40,449
spared and were not

102
00:01:40,449 --> 00:01:40,39
sunk and buried up

103
00:01:40,39 --> 00:01:40,331
in the earth; and

104
00:01:40,331 --> 00:01:40,272
they were not drowned

105
00:01:40,272 --> 00:01:40,213
in the depths of

106
00:01:40,213 --> 00:01:40,154
the sea; and they

107
00:01:40,154 --> 00:01:40,095
were not burned by

108
00:01:40,095 --> 00:01:40,036
fire, neither were

109
00:01:40,036 --> 00:01:39,977
they fallen upon and

110
00:01:39,977 --> 00:01:39,918
crushed to death;

111
00:01:39,918 --> 00:01:39,859
and they were not

112
00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:39,8
carried away in the

113
00:01:39,8 --> 00:01:39,741
whirlwind; neither

114
00:01:39,741 --> 00:01:39,682
were they

115
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:39,623
overpowered by the vapor of

116
00:01:39,623 --> 00:01:39,633
smoke and of darkness.

117
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:41,422
14 And now, whoso

118
00:01:41,422 --> 00:01:43,211
readeth, let him

119
00:01:43,211 --> 00:01:44,0
understand; he that

120
00:01:44,0 --> 00:01:46,789
hath the

121
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:48,578
scriptures, let him search

122
00:01:48,578 --> 00:01:50,367
them, and see and

123
00:01:50,367 --> 00:01:52,156
behold if all

124
00:01:52,156 --> 00:01:53,945
these deaths and

125
00:01:53,945 --> 00:01:55,734
destructions by fire,

126
00:01:55,734 --> 00:01:57,523
and by smoke, and

127
00:01:57,523 --> 00:01:59,312
by tempests, and

128
00:01:59,312 --> 00:02:01,101
by whirlwinds, and

129
00:02:01,101 --> 00:02:02,89
by the opening of

130
00:02:02,89 --> 00:02:04,679
the earth to

131
00:02:04,679 --> 00:02:06,468
receive them, and all

132
00:02:06,468 --> 00:02:08,257
these things are

133
00:02:08,257 --> 00:02:10,046
not unto the

134
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:11,835
fulfilling of the

135
00:02:11,835 --> 00:02:13,433
prophecies of many of the holy prophets.

136
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:13,322
15 Behold, I say

137
00:02:13,322 --> 00:02:13,211
unto you, Yea,

138
00:02:13,211 --> 00:02:13,1
many have

139
00:02:13,1 --> 00:02:12,989
testified of these

140
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:12,878
things at the

141
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:12,767
coming of Christ, and

142
00:02:12,767 --> 00:02:12,656
were slain

143
00:02:12,656 --> 00:02:12,545
because they

144
00:02:12,545 --> 00:02:12,499
testified of these things.

145
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:12,666
16 Yea, the

146
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:12,833
prophet Zenos did

147
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:13,0
testify of

148
00:02:13,0 --> 00:02:13,167
these things, and

149
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:13,334
also Zenock

150
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:13,501
spake concerning

151
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:13,668
these things,

152
00:02:13,668 --> 00:02:13,835
because they

153
00:02:13,835 --> 00:02:14,002
testified

154
00:02:14,002 --> 00:02:14,169
particularly concerning

155
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:14,336
us, who are the

156
00:02:14,336 --> 00:02:14,901
remnant of their seed.

157
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:15,164
17 Behold, our

158
00:02:15,164 --> 00:02:15,427
father Jacob

159
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:15,69
also testified

160
00:02:15,69 --> 00:02:15,953
concerning a

161
00:02:15,953 --> 00:02:16,216
remnant of the

162
00:02:16,216 --> 00:02:16,479
seed of

163
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:16,742
Joseph. And behold,

164
00:02:16,742 --> 00:02:17,005
are not we a

165
00:02:17,005 --> 00:02:17,268
remnant of the

166
00:02:17,268 --> 00:02:17,531
seed of

167
00:02:17,531 --> 00:02:17,794
Joseph? And these

168
00:02:17,794 --> 00:02:18,057
things which

169
00:02:18,057 --> 00:02:18,32
testify of us,

170
00:02:18,32 --> 00:02:18,583
are they not

171
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:18,846
written upon the

172
00:02:18,846 --> 00:02:19,109
plates of

173
00:02:19,109 --> 00:02:19,372
brass which our

174
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:19,635
father Lehi

175
00:02:19,635 --> 00:02:19,306
brought out of Jerusalem?

176
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:19,754
18 And it

177
00:02:19,754 --> 00:02:20,202
came to pass

178
00:02:20,202 --> 00:02:20,65
that in the

179
00:02:20,65 --> 00:02:21,098
ending of the

180
00:02:21,098 --> 00:02:21,546
thirty and

181
00:02:21,546 --> 00:02:21,994
fourth year,

182
00:02:21,994 --> 00:02:22,442
behold, I will

183
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:22,89
show unto you

184
00:02:22,89 --> 00:02:23,338
that the people

185
00:02:23,338 --> 00:02:23,786
of Nephi who

186
00:02:23,786 --> 00:02:24,234
were spared,

187
00:02:24,234 --> 00:02:24,682
and also

188
00:02:24,682 --> 00:02:25,13
those who had

189
00:02:25,13 --> 00:02:25,578
been called

190
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:26,026
Lamanites, who

191
00:02:26,026 --> 00:02:26,474
had been

192
00:02:26,474 --> 00:02:26,922
spared, did have

193
00:02:26,922 --> 00:02:27,37
great favors

194
00:02:27,37 --> 00:02:27,818
shown unto

195
00:02:27,818 --> 00:02:28,266
them, and great

196
00:02:28,266 --> 00:02:28,714
blessings

197
00:02:28,714 --> 00:02:29,162
poured out upon

198
00:02:29,162 --> 00:02:29,61
their heads,

199
00:02:29,61 --> 00:02:30,058
insomuch that

200
00:02:30,058 --> 00:02:30,506
soon after

201
00:02:30,506 --> 00:02:30,954
the ascension

202
00:02:30,954 --> 00:02:31,402
of Christ

203
00:02:31,402 --> 00:02:31,85
into heaven he

204
00:02:31,85 --> 00:02:32,653
did truly manifest himself unto them—

205
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:32,576
19 Showing

206
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:32,499
his body unto

207
00:02:32,499 --> 00:02:32,422
them, and

208
00:02:32,422 --> 00:02:32,345
ministering

209
00:02:32,345 --> 00:02:32,268
unto them;

210
00:02:32,268 --> 00:02:32,191
and an account

211
00:02:32,191 --> 00:02:32,114
of his

212
00:02:32,114 --> 00:02:32,036
ministry shall

213
00:02:32,036 --> 00:02:31,959
be given

214
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:31,882
hereafter.

215
00:02:31,882 --> 00:02:31,805
Therefore for

216
00:02:31,805 --> 00:02:31,728
this time I

217
00:02:31,728 --> 00:02:31,718
make an end of my sayings.
