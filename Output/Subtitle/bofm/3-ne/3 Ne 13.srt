00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,4
Chapter 13 Jesus teaches the Nephites the Lord’s

2
00:00:01,4 --> 00:00:02,8
 Prayer—They are to lay up treasures in heaven—The

3
00:00:02,8 --> 00:00:04,2
 twelve disciples in their ministry are commanded to

4
00:00:04,2 --> 00:00:05,6
 take no thought for temporal things—Compare

5
00:00:05,6 --> 00:00:07,0
Matthew 6. About A.D. 34.

6
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:11,175
1 Verily, verily, I say that I would that ye

7
00:00:11,175 --> 00:00:14,375
 should do alms unto the poor; but take heed that ye do

8
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:17,575
 not your alms before men to be seen of them;

9
00:00:17,575 --> 00:00:20,775
 otherwise ye have no reward of your Father who is in

10
00:00:20,775 --> 00:00:23,975
 heaven

11
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:38,724
2 Therefore, when ye shall do your alms do not

12
00:00:38,724 --> 00:00:53,524
 sound a trumpet before you, as will hypocrites do in

13
00:00:53,524 --> 00:01:08,324
 the synagogues and in the streets, that they may

14
00:01:08,324 --> 00:01:23,124
 have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, they have

15
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:37,924
 their reward

16
00:01:37,13 --> 00:01:44,63
3 But when thou doest alms let not thy left hand

17
00:01:44,63 --> 00:01:52,13
 know what thy right hand doeth

18
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:57,379
4 That thine alms may be in secret; and thy Father

19
00:01:57,379 --> 00:02:02,379
 who seeth in secret, himself shall reward thee

20
00:02:02,379 --> 00:02:07,379
 openly

21
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:12,927
5 And when thou prayest thou shalt not do as the

22
00:02:12,927 --> 00:02:18,727
 hypocrites, for they love to pray, standing in the

23
00:02:18,727 --> 00:02:24,527
 synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that

24
00:02:24,527 --> 00:02:30,327
 they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you,

25
00:02:30,327 --> 00:02:36,127
 they have their reward

26
00:02:36,89 --> 00:02:43,89
6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy

27
00:02:43,89 --> 00:02:50,89
 closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy

28
00:02:50,89 --> 00:02:57,89
 Father who is in secret; and thy Father, who seeth

29
00:02:57,89 --> 00:03:04,89
 in secret, shall reward thee openly

30
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:12,151
7 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as

31
00:03:12,151 --> 00:03:19,484
 the heathen, for they think that they shall be

32
00:03:19,484 --> 00:03:26,817
 heard for their much speaking

33
00:03:26,54 --> 00:03:31,54
8 Be not ye therefore like unto them, for your

34
00:03:31,54 --> 00:03:36,54
 Father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye

35
00:03:36,54 --> 00:03:41,54
 ask him

36
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:48,788
9 After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father

37
00:03:48,788 --> 00:03:56,288
 who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name

38
00:03:56,937 --> 00:04:04,937
10 Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven

39
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:10,311
11 And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our

40
00:04:10,311 --> 00:04:16,311
 debtors

41
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:20,257
12 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us

42
00:04:20,257 --> 00:04:23,757
 from evil

43
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:29,764
13 For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and

44
00:04:29,764 --> 00:04:35,764
 the glory, forever. Amen

45
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:42,375
14 For, if ye forgive men their trespasses your

46
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:49,375
 heavenly Father will also forgive you

47
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:55,523
15 But if ye forgive not men their trespasses

48
00:04:55,523 --> 00:05:01,523
 neither will your Father forgive your trespasses

49
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:08,751
16 Moreover, when ye fast be not as the

50
00:05:08,751 --> 00:05:16,001
 hypocrites, of a sad countenance, for they disfigure their

51
00:05:16,001 --> 00:05:23,251
 faces that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily

52
00:05:23,251 --> 00:05:30,501
 I say unto you, they have their reward

53
00:05:30,53 --> 00:05:35,53
17 But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thy head,

54
00:05:35,53 --> 00:05:40,53
 and wash thy face

55
00:05:40,54 --> 00:05:47,873
18 That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto

56
00:05:47,873 --> 00:05:55,206
 thy Father, who is in secret; and thy Father, who

57
00:05:55,206 --> 00:06:02,539
 seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly

58
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:09,395
19 Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth,

59
00:06:09,395 --> 00:06:16,395
 where moth and rust doth corrupt, and thieves

60
00:06:16,395 --> 00:06:23,395
 break through and steal

61
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:29,75
20 But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven,

62
00:06:29,75 --> 00:06:36,417
 where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and

63
00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:43,084
 where thieves do not break through nor steal

64
00:06:43,97 --> 00:06:48,97
21 For where your treasure is, there will your

65
00:06:48,97 --> 00:06:53,97
 heart be also

66
00:06:53,98 --> 00:07:00,98
22 The light of the body is the eye; if,

67
00:07:00,98 --> 00:07:07,98
 therefore, thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be

68
00:07:07,98 --> 00:07:14,98
 full of light

69
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:19,767
23 But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall

70
00:07:19,767 --> 00:07:25,267
 be full of darkness. If, therefore, the light that

71
00:07:25,267 --> 00:07:30,767
 is in thee be darkness, how great is that

72
00:07:30,767 --> 00:07:36,267
 darkness

73
00:07:36,99 --> 00:07:44,74
24 No man can serve two masters; for either he

74
00:07:44,74 --> 00:07:52,49
 will hate the one and love the other, or else he will

75
00:07:52,49 --> 00:08:00,24
 hold to the one and despise the other. Ye cannot

76
00:08:00,24 --> 00:08:07,99
 serve God and Mammon

77
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:14,131
25 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had

78
00:08:14,131 --> 00:08:20,575
 spoken these words he looked upon the twelve whom he

79
00:08:20,575 --> 00:08:27,019
 had chosen, and said unto them: Remember the words

80
00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:33,463
 which I have spoken. For behold, ye are they whom

81
00:08:33,463 --> 00:08:39,907
 I have chosen to minister unto this people.

82
00:08:39,907 --> 00:08:46,351
 Therefore I say unto you, take no thought for your

83
00:08:46,351 --> 00:08:52,795
 life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor

84
00:08:52,795 --> 00:08:59,239
 yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the

85
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:05,683
 life more than meat, and the body than raiment

86
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:13,095
26 Behold the fowls of the air, for they sow not,

87
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:20,345
 neither do they reap nor gather into barns; yet

88
00:09:20,345 --> 00:09:27,595
 your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much

89
00:09:27,595 --> 00:09:34,845
 better than they

90
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:42,007
27 Which of you by taking thought can add one

91
00:09:42,007 --> 00:09:49,507
 cubit unto his stature

92
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:56,388
28 And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider

93
00:09:56,388 --> 00:10:03,721
 the lilies of the field how they grow; they toil

94
00:10:03,721 --> 00:10:11,054
 not, neither do they spin

95
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:20,744
29 And yet I say unto you, that even Solomon, in

96
00:10:20,744 --> 00:10:29,744
 all his glory, was not arrayed like one of these

97
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:36,562
30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the

98
00:10:36,562 --> 00:10:43,562
 field, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the

99
00:10:43,562 --> 00:10:50,562
 oven, even so will he clothe you, if ye are not

100
00:10:50,562 --> 00:10:57,562
 of little faith

101
00:10:57,524 --> 00:11:01,857
31 Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall

102
00:11:01,857 --> 00:11:06,19
 we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal

103
00:11:06,19 --> 00:11:10,523
 shall we be clothed

104
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:15,303
32 For your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have

105
00:11:15,303 --> 00:11:20,303
 need of all these things

106
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:25,079
33 But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his

107
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:30,079
 righteousness, and all these things shall be added

108
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:35,079
 unto you

109
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:37,078
34 Take therefore no thought for the morrow, for

110
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:38,828
 the morrow shall take thought for the things of

111
00:11:38,828 --> 00:11:40,578
 itself. Sufficient is the day unto the evil thereof.

112
00:11:40,578 --> 00:11:42,328
