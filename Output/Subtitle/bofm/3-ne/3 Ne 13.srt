00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 13 Jesus teaches the Nephites the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Lord’s Prayer—They are to lay up treasures in

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
heaven—The twelve disciples in their

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
ministry are commanded to take no thought for

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:06:41,
temporal things—Compare 
Matthew 6. About A.D. 34. 

6
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
1 Verily, verily, I say that I would that

7
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
ye should do alms unto the poor; but

8
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
take heed that ye do not your alms before

9
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
men to be seen of them; otherwise ye have

10
00:06:41,0 --> 00:07:53,
no reward of your Father who is in heaven.

11
00:07:53,0 --> 00:07:53,0
2 Therefore, when ye shall do your

12
00:07:53,0 --> 00:07:53,0
alms do not sound a trumpet before

13
00:07:53,0 --> 00:07:53,0
you, as will hypocrites do in the

14
00:07:53,0 --> 00:07:53,0
synagogues and in the streets, that

15
00:07:53,0 --> 00:07:53,0
they may have glory of men. Verily

16
00:07:53,0 --> 00:17:03,
I say unto you, they have their reward.

17
00:17:03,0 --> 00:17:03,0
3 But when thou doest alms

18
00:17:03,0 --> 00:17:03,0
let not thy left hand

19
00:17:03,0 --> 00:16:35,
know what thy right hand doeth;

20
00:16:35,0 --> 00:16:35,0
4 That thine alms may

21
00:16:35,0 --> 00:16:35,0
be in secret; and

22
00:16:35,0 --> 00:16:35,0
thy Father who seeth in

23
00:16:35,0 --> 00:16:35,0
secret, himself

24
00:16:35,0 --> 00:18:47,
shall reward thee openly.

25
00:18:47,0 --> 00:18:47,0
5 And when thou

26
00:18:47,0 --> 00:18:47,0
prayest thou shalt not

27
00:18:47,0 --> 00:18:47,0
do as the hypocrites,

28
00:18:47,0 --> 00:18:47,0
for they love to

29
00:18:47,0 --> 00:18:47,0
pray, standing in the

30
00:18:47,0 --> 00:18:47,0
synagogues and in

31
00:18:47,0 --> 00:18:47,0
the corners of the

32
00:18:47,0 --> 00:18:47,0
streets, that they may

33
00:18:47,0 --> 00:18:47,0
be seen of men.

34
00:18:47,0 --> 00:18:47,0
Verily I say unto you,

35
00:18:47,0 --> 00:19:59,
they have their reward.

36
00:19:59,0 --> 00:19:59,0
6 But thou, when

37
00:19:59,0 --> 00:19:59,0
thou prayest, enter

38
00:19:59,0 --> 00:19:59,0
into thy closet,

39
00:19:59,0 --> 00:19:59,0
and when thou hast

40
00:19:59,0 --> 00:19:59,0
shut thy door,

41
00:19:59,0 --> 00:19:59,0
pray to thy Father

42
00:19:59,0 --> 00:19:59,0
who is in secret;

43
00:19:59,0 --> 00:19:59,0
and thy Father, who

44
00:19:59,0 --> 00:19:59,0
seeth in secret,

45
00:19:59,0 --> 00:19:31,
shall reward thee openly.

46
00:19:31,0 --> 00:19:31,0
7 But when ye

47
00:19:31,0 --> 00:19:31,0
pray, use not vain

48
00:19:31,0 --> 00:19:31,0
repetitions, as the

49
00:19:31,0 --> 00:19:31,0
heathen, for they

50
00:19:31,0 --> 00:19:31,0
think that they

51
00:19:31,0 --> 00:19:31,0
shall be heard for

52
00:19:31,0 --> 00:30:59,
their much speaking.

53
00:30:59,0 --> 00:30:59,0
8 Be not ye

54
00:30:59,0 --> 00:30:59,0
therefore like unto

55
00:30:59,0 --> 00:30:59,0
them, for your Father

56
00:30:59,0 --> 00:30:59,0
knoweth what

57
00:30:59,0 --> 00:30:59,0
things ye have need of

58
00:30:59,0 --> 00:30:31,
before ye ask him.

59
00:30:31,0 --> 00:30:31,0
9 After this

60
00:30:31,0 --> 00:30:31,0
manner therefore pray

61
00:30:31,0 --> 00:30:31,0
ye: Our Father who

62
00:30:31,0 --> 00:30:31,0
art in heaven,

63
00:30:31,0 --> 00:30:03,
hallowed be thy name.

64
00:30:03,0 --> 00:30:03,0
10 Thy will be

65
00:30:03,0 --> 00:30:03,0
done on earth as

66
00:30:03,0 --> 00:33:34,
it is in heaven.

67
00:33:34,0 --> 00:33:34,0
11 And

68
00:33:34,0 --> 00:33:34,0
forgive us our

69
00:33:34,0 --> 00:33:34,0
debts, as we

70
00:33:34,0 --> 00:33:06,
forgive our debtors.

71
00:33:06,0 --> 00:33:06,0
12 And lead

72
00:33:06,0 --> 00:33:06,0
us not into

73
00:33:06,0 --> 00:33:06,0
temptation,

74
00:33:06,0 --> 00:33:06,0
but deliver

75
00:33:06,0 --> 00:48:34,
us from evil.

76
00:48:34,0 --> 00:48:34,0
13 For

77
00:48:34,0 --> 00:48:34,0
thine is the

78
00:48:34,0 --> 00:48:34,0
kingdom,

79
00:48:34,0 --> 00:48:34,0
and the

80
00:48:34,0 --> 00:48:34,0
power, and

81
00:48:34,0 --> 00:48:34,0
the glory,

82
00:48:34,0 --> 00:50:46,
forever. Amen.

83
00:50:46,0 --> 00:50:46,0
14 For,

84
00:50:46,0 --> 00:50:46,0
if ye

85
00:50:46,0 --> 00:50:46,0
forgive men

86
00:50:46,0 --> 00:50:46,0
their

87
00:50:46,0 --> 00:50:46,0
trespasses

88
00:50:46,0 --> 00:50:46,0
your

89
00:50:46,0 --> 00:50:46,0
heavenly Father

90
00:50:46,0 --> 00:50:46,0
will

91
00:50:46,0 --> 00:54:59,
also forgive you;

92
00:54:59,0 --> 00:54:59,0
15 But

93
00:54:59,0 --> 00:54:59,0
if ye

94
00:54:59,0 --> 00:54:59,0
forgive not

95
00:54:59,0 --> 00:54:59,0
men

96
00:54:59,0 --> 00:54:59,0
their

97
00:54:59,0 --> 00:54:59,0
trespasses

98
00:54:59,0 --> 00:54:59,0
neither

99
00:54:59,0 --> 00:54:59,0
will your

100
00:54:59,0 --> 00:54:59,0
Father

101
00:54:59,0 --> 00:54:59,0
forgive

102
00:54:59,0 --> 00:54:31,
your trespasses.

103
00:54:31,0 --> 00:54:31,0
16

104
00:54:31,0 --> 00:54:31,0
Moreover,

105
00:54:31,0 --> 00:54:31,0
when ye

106
00:54:31,0 --> 00:54:31,0
fast be

107
00:54:31,0 --> 00:54:31,0
not as

108
00:54:31,0 --> 00:54:31,0
the

109
00:54:31,0 --> 00:54:31,0


110
00:54:31,0 --> 00:54:31,0
hypocrites, of a

111
00:54:31,0 --> 00:54:31,0
sad

112
00:54:31,0 --> 00:54:31,0


113
00:54:31,0 --> 00:54:31,0
countenance, for

114
00:54:31,0 --> 00:54:31,0
they

115
00:54:31,0 --> 00:54:31,0


116
00:54:31,0 --> 00:54:31,0
disfigure their

117
00:54:31,0 --> 00:54:31,0
faces

118
00:54:31,0 --> 00:54:31,0
that

119
00:54:31,0 --> 00:54:31,0
they may

120
00:54:31,0 --> 00:54:31,0
appear

121
00:54:31,0 --> 00:54:31,0
unto

122
00:54:31,0 --> 00:54:31,0
men to

123
00:54:31,0 --> 00:54:31,0
fast.

124
00:54:31,0 --> 00:54:31,0
Verily I

125
00:54:31,0 --> 00:54:31,0
say unto

126
00:54:31,0 --> 00:54:03,
you, they have their reward.

127
00:54:03,0 --> 00:54:03,0
17 But

128
00:54:03,0 --> 00:54:03,0
thou,

129
00:54:03,0 --> 00:54:03,0
when

130
00:54:03,0 --> 00:54:03,0

131
00:54:03,0 --> 00:54:03,0


132
00:54:03,0 --> 00:54:03,0
fastest,

133
00:54:03,0 --> 00:54:03,0
anoint thy

134
00:54:03,0 --> 00:54:03,0
head,

135
00:54:03,0 --> 00:54:03,0
and

136
00:54:03,0 --> 00:53:35,
wash thy face;

137
00:53:35,0 --> 00:53:35,0
18

138
00:53:35,0 --> 00:53:35,0
That

Father,

who is

151
00:53:35,0 --> 00:53:35,0

Father, who

00:53:35,0 --> 00:53:35,0


158
00:53:35,0 --> 00:53:35,0
seeth in

00:53:35,0 --> 00:53:35,0


160
00:53:35,0 --> 00:57:05,
secret, shall reward thee openly.
