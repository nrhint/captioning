00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 28 Nine of the twelve disciples desire

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and are promised an inheritance in Christ’s

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
kingdom when they die—The Three Nephites desire and

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
are given power over death so as to remain on the

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
earth until Jesus comes again—They are

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
translated and see things not lawful to utter, and they

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:08:42,
are now ministering among men. About A.D. 34–35. 

8
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
1 And it came to pass when Jesus had said

9
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
these words, he spake unto his disciples, one by

10
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
one, saying unto them: What is it that ye

11
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:56,
desire of me, after that I am gone to the Father?

12
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
2 And they all spake, save it were three,

13
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
saying: We desire that after we have lived

14
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
unto the age of man, that our ministry, wherein

15
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
thou hast called us, may have an end, that

16
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:42,
we may speedily come unto thee in thy kingdom.

17
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
3 And he said unto them: Blessed are ye

18
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
because ye desired this thing of me;

19
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
therefore, after that ye are seventy and

20
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
two years old ye shall come unto me in my

21
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:56,
kingdom; and with me ye shall find rest.

22
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
4 And when he had spoken unto

23
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
them, he turned himself unto the

24
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
three, and said unto them: What

25
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
will ye that I should do unto

26
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:42,
you, when I am gone unto the Father?

27
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
5 And they sorrowed in

28
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
their hearts, for they

29
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
durst not speak unto him the

30
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:56,
thing which they desired.

31
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
6 And he said unto them:

32
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
Behold, I know your

33
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
thoughts, and ye have

34
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
desired the thing which John,

35
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
my beloved, who was

36
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
with me in my ministry,

37
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
before that I was lifted up

38
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:42,
by the Jews, desired of me.

39
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
7 Therefore, more

40
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
blessed are ye, for ye shall

41
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
never taste of death;

42
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
but ye shall live to

43
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
behold all the doings of

44
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
the Father unto the

45
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
children of men, even

46
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
until all things shall be

47
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
fulfilled according to

48
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
the will of the Father,

49
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
when I shall come in my

50
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:56,
glory with the powers of heaven.

51
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
8 And ye shall never

52
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
endure the pains of

53
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
death; but when I

54
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
shall come in my glory ye

55
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
shall be changed in

56
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
the twinkling of an

57
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
eye from mortality to

58
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
immortality; and then

59
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
shall ye be blessed

60
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:42,
in the kingdom of my Father.

61
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
9 And again, ye

62
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
shall not have pain

63
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
while ye shall dwell in

64
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
the flesh, neither

65
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
sorrow save it be for

66
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
the sins of the

67
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
world; and all this

68
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
will I do because of

69
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
the thing which ye

70
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
have desired of me, for

71
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
ye have desired

72
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
that ye might bring the

73
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
souls of men unto

74
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:56,
me, while the world shall stand.

75
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
10 And for this

76
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
cause ye shall have

77
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
fulness of joy; and

78
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
ye shall sit down in

79
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
the kingdom of my

80
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
Father; yea, your

81
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
joy shall be full,

82
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
even as the Father

83
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
hath given me

84
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
fulness of joy; and ye

85
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
shall be even as I

86
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
am, and I am even as

87
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
the Father; and the

88
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:42,
Father and I are one;

89
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
11 And the Holy

90
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
Ghost beareth

91
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
record of the Father

92
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
and me; and the

93
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
Father giveth the

94
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
Holy Ghost unto

95
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
the children of

96
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:56,
men, because of me.

97
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
12 And it came

98
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
to pass that

99
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
when Jesus had

100
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
spoken these

101
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
words, he touched

102
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
every one of

103
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
them with his

104
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
finger save it were

105
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
the three who

106
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
were to tarry,

107
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:42,
and then he departed.

108
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
13 And behold,

109
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
the heavens

110
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
were opened,

111
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
and they were

112
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
caught up into

113
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
heaven, and saw

114
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
and heard

115
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:56,
unspeakable things.

116
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
14 And it was

117
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
forbidden

118
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
them that they

119
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
should utter;

120
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
neither was

121
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
it given unto

122
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
them power

123
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
that they

124
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
could utter the

125
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
things which

126
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:42,
they saw and heard;

127
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
15 And

128
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
whether they were

129
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
in the body

130
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
or out of

131
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
the body,

132
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
they could not

133
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
tell; for it

134
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
did seem

135
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
unto them like

136
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
a

137
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
transfiguration of

138
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
them, that

139
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
they were

140
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
changed from this

141
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
body of

142
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
flesh into an

143
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
immortal

144
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
state, that they

145
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
could

146
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:56,
behold the things of God.

147
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
16 But it

148
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
came to pass

149
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
that they

150
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
did again

151
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
minister

152
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
upon the face

153
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
of the

154
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
earth;

155
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
nevertheless they

156
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
did not

157
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
minister of the

158
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
things

159
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
which they had

160
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
heard and

161
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
seen,

162
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
because of the

163
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
commandment

164
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
which was

165
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:42,
given them in heaven.

166
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
17 And

167
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
now, whether

168
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
they were

169
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
mortal or

170
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
immortal,

171
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
from the

172
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
day of

173
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
their

174
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
transfiguration, I

175
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:56,
know not;

176
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
18 But

177
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
this much I

178
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
know,

179
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
according

180
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
to the

181
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
record which

182
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
hath

183
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
been

184
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
given—they did

185
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
go forth

186
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
upon the

187
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
face of

188
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
the land,

189
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
and did

190
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
minister

191
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
unto all

192
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
the people,

193
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
uniting

194
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
as many

195
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
to the

196
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
church as

197
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
would

198
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
believe in

199
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
their

200
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
preaching;

201
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
baptizing

202
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
them, and as

203
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
many as

204
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
were

205
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:42,
baptized did receive the Holy Ghost.

206
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
19 And

207
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
they were

208
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
cast

209
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
into

210
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
prison by

211
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
them who

212
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
did not

213
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
belong to

214
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
the

215
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
church. And

216
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
the

217
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
prisons

218
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
could not

219
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
hold them,

220
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
for

221
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:56,
they were rent in twain.

222
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
20 And

223
00:08:56,0 --> 00:08:56,0
they
