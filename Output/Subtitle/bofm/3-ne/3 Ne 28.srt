00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,0
Chapter 28 Nine of the twelve disciples desire and

2
00:00:01,0 --> 00:00:02,0
 are promised an inheritance in Christ’s kingdom

3
00:00:02,0 --> 00:00:03,0
 when they die—The Three Nephites desire and are

4
00:00:03,0 --> 00:00:04,0
 given power over death so as to remain on the earth

5
00:00:04,0 --> 00:00:05,0
 until Jesus comes again—They are translated and see

6
00:00:05,0 --> 00:00:06,0
 things not lawful to utter, and they are now

7
00:00:06,0 --> 00:00:07,0
 ministering among men. About A.D. 34–35.

8
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,975
1 And it came to pass when Jesus had said these

9
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:11,975
 words, he spake unto his disciples, one by one,

10
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:13,975
 saying unto them: What is it that ye desire of me,

11
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:15,975
 after that I am gone to the Father

12
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,549
2 And they all spake, save it were three, saying:

13
00:00:17,549 --> 00:00:19,149
 We desire that after we have lived unto the age of

14
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:20,749
 man, that our ministry, wherein thou hast called

15
00:00:20,749 --> 00:00:22,349
 us, may have an end, that we may speedily come

16
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:23,949
 unto thee in thy kingdom

17
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,524
3 And he said unto them: Blessed are ye because ye

18
00:00:25,524 --> 00:00:27,124
 desired this thing of me; therefore, after that

19
00:00:27,124 --> 00:00:28,724
 ye are seventy and two years old ye shall come unto

20
00:00:28,724 --> 00:00:30,324
 me in my kingdom; and with me ye shall find rest

21
00:00:30,324 --> 00:00:31,924


22
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,899
4 And when he had spoken unto them, he turned

23
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,899
 himself unto the three, and said unto them: What will

24
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:37,899
 ye that I should do unto you, when I am gone unto

25
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:39,899
 the Father

26
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,54
5 And they sorrowed in their hearts, for they

27
00:00:42,54 --> 00:00:45,207
 durst not speak unto him the thing which they desired

28
00:00:45,207 --> 00:00:47,874


29
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:53,848
6 And he said unto them: Behold, I know your

30
00:00:53,848 --> 00:00:59,848
 thoughts, and ye have desired the thing which John, my

31
00:00:59,848 --> 00:01:05,848
 beloved, who was with me in my ministry, before

32
00:01:05,848 --> 00:01:11,848
 that I was lifted up by the Jews, desired of me

33
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:13,105
7 Therefore, more blessed are ye, for ye shall

34
00:01:13,105 --> 00:01:14,438
 never taste of death; but ye shall live to behold all

35
00:01:14,438 --> 00:01:15,771
 the doings of the Father unto the children of

36
00:01:15,771 --> 00:01:17,104
 men, even until all things shall be fulfilled

37
00:01:17,104 --> 00:01:18,437
 according to the will of the Father, when I shall come in

38
00:01:18,437 --> 00:01:19,77
 my glory with the powers of heaven

39
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:26,146
8 And ye shall never endure the pains of death;

40
00:01:26,146 --> 00:01:32,546
 but when I shall come in my glory ye shall be

41
00:01:32,546 --> 00:01:38,946
 changed in the twinkling of an eye from mortality to

42
00:01:38,946 --> 00:01:45,346
 immortality; and then shall ye be blessed in the

43
00:01:45,346 --> 00:01:51,746
 kingdom of my Father

44
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:52,978
9 And again, ye shall not have pain while ye shall

45
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:54,311
 dwell in the flesh, neither sorrow save it be for

46
00:01:54,311 --> 00:01:55,644
 the sins of the world; and all this will I do

47
00:01:55,644 --> 00:01:56,977
 because of the thing which ye have desired of me, for

48
00:01:56,977 --> 00:01:58,31
 ye have desired that ye might bring the souls of

49
00:01:58,31 --> 00:01:59,643
 men unto me, while the world shall stand

50
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:00,953
10 And for this cause ye shall have fulness of

51
00:02:00,953 --> 00:02:02,285
 joy; and ye shall sit down in the kingdom of my

52
00:02:02,285 --> 00:02:03,618
 Father; yea, your joy shall be full, even as the Father

53
00:02:03,618 --> 00:02:04,951
 hath given me fulness of joy; and ye shall be

54
00:02:04,951 --> 00:02:06,285
 even as I am, and I am even as the Father; and the

55
00:02:06,285 --> 00:02:07,618
 Father and I are one

56
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:10,261
11 And the Holy Ghost beareth record of the Father

57
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:12,928
 and me; and the Father giveth the Holy Ghost unto

58
00:02:12,928 --> 00:02:15,595
 the children of men, because of me

59
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:19,569
12 And it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken

60
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:23,569
 these words, he touched every one of them with his

61
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:27,569
 finger save it were the three who were to tarry,

62
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:31,569
 and then he departed

63
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:34,185
13 And behold, the heavens were opened, and they

64
00:02:34,185 --> 00:02:36,852
 were caught up into heaven, and saw and heard

65
00:02:36,852 --> 00:02:39,519
 unspeakable things

66
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:44,826
14 And it was forbidden them that they should

67
00:02:44,826 --> 00:02:50,159
 utter; neither was it given unto them power that they

68
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:55,492
 could utter the things which they saw and heard

69
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:58,642
15 And whether they were in the body or out of the

70
00:02:58,642 --> 00:03:01,842
 body, they could not tell; for it did seem unto

71
00:03:01,842 --> 00:03:05,042
 them like a transfiguration of them, that they were

72
00:03:05,042 --> 00:03:08,242
 changed from this body of flesh into an immortal

73
00:03:08,242 --> 00:03:11,442
 state, that they could behold the things of God

74
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:14,591
16 But it came to pass that they did again

75
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:17,791
 minister upon the face of the earth; nevertheless they

76
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:20,991
 did not minister of the things which they had heard

77
00:03:20,991 --> 00:03:24,191
 and seen, because of the commandment which was

78
00:03:24,191 --> 00:03:27,391
 given them in heaven

79
00:03:27,34 --> 00:03:30,007
17 And now, whether they were mortal or immortal,

80
00:03:30,007 --> 00:03:32,674
 from the day of their transfiguration, I know not

81
00:03:32,674 --> 00:03:35,341


82
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,982
18 But this much I know, according to the record

83
00:03:37,982 --> 00:03:40,649
 which hath been given—they did go forth upon the

84
00:03:40,649 --> 00:03:43,316
 face of the land, and did minister unto all the

85
00:03:43,316 --> 00:03:45,983
 people, uniting as many to the church as would believe

86
00:03:45,983 --> 00:03:48,65
 in their preaching; baptizing them, and as many

87
00:03:48,65 --> 00:03:51,317
 as were baptized did receive the Holy Ghost

88
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,931
19 And they were cast into prison by them who did

89
00:03:53,931 --> 00:03:56,598
 not belong to the church. And the prisons could

90
00:03:56,598 --> 00:03:59,265
 not hold them, for they were rent in twain

91
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:05,639
20 And they were cast down into the earth; but

92
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:12,039
 they did smite the earth with the word of God,

93
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:18,439
 insomuch that by his power they were delivered out of

94
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:24,839
 the depths of the earth; and therefore they could

95
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:31,239
 not dig pits sufficient to hold them

96
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:43,138
21 And thrice they were cast into a furnace and

97
00:04:43,138 --> 00:04:55,138
 received no harm

98
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,061
22 And twice were they cast into a den of wild

99
00:04:57,061 --> 00:04:59,061
 beasts; and behold they did play with the beasts as a

100
00:04:59,061 --> 00:05:01,061
 child with a suckling lamb, and received no harm

101
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:03,061


102
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,179
23 And it came to pass that thus they did go forth

103
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:05,322
 among all the people of Nephi, and did preach the

104
00:05:05,322 --> 00:05:06,465
 gospel of Christ unto all people upon the face of

105
00:05:06,465 --> 00:05:07,608
 the land; and they were converted unto the Lord,

106
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:08,751
 and were united unto the church of Christ, and

107
00:05:08,751 --> 00:05:09,894
 thus the people of that generation were blessed,

108
00:05:09,894 --> 00:05:11,037
 according to the word of Jesus

109
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:14,511
24 And now I, Mormon, make an end of speaking

110
00:05:14,511 --> 00:05:18,011
 concerning these things for a time

111
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,985
25 Behold, I was about to write the names of those

112
00:05:20,985 --> 00:05:22,985
 who were never to taste of death, but the Lord

113
00:05:22,985 --> 00:05:24,985
 forbade; therefore I write them not, for they are

114
00:05:24,985 --> 00:05:26,985
 hid from the world

115
00:05:26,96 --> 00:05:30,96
26 But behold, I have seen them, and they have

116
00:05:30,96 --> 00:05:34,96
 ministered unto me

117
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:42,935
27 And behold they will be among the Gentiles, and

118
00:05:42,935 --> 00:05:50,935
 the Gentiles shall know them not

119
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:58,884
28 They will also be among the Jews, and the Jews

120
00:05:58,884 --> 00:06:06,884
 shall know them not

121
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:07,976
29 And it shall come to pass, when the Lord seeth

122
00:06:07,976 --> 00:06:09,119
 fit in his wisdom that they shall minister unto

123
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,262
 all the scattered tribes of Israel, and unto all

124
00:06:10,262 --> 00:06:11,405
 nations, kindreds, tongues and people, and shall

125
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:12,548
 bring out of them unto Jesus many souls, that their

126
00:06:12,548 --> 00:06:13,691
 desire may be fulfilled, and also because of the

127
00:06:13,691 --> 00:06:14,834
 convincing power of God which is in them

128
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:16,808
30 And they are as the angels of God, and if they

129
00:06:16,808 --> 00:06:18,808
 shall pray unto the Father in the name of Jesus

130
00:06:18,808 --> 00:06:20,808
 they can show themselves unto whatsoever man it

131
00:06:20,808 --> 00:06:22,808
 seemeth them good

132
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,782
31 Therefore, great and marvelous works shall be

133
00:06:24,782 --> 00:06:26,782
 wrought by them, before the great and coming day

134
00:06:26,782 --> 00:06:28,782
 when all people must surely stand before the

135
00:06:28,782 --> 00:06:30,782
 judgment-seat of Christ

136
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:33,424
32 Yea even among the Gentiles shall there be a

137
00:06:33,424 --> 00:06:36,091
 great and marvelous work wrought by them, before

138
00:06:36,091 --> 00:06:38,758
 that judgment day

139
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:42,732
33 And if ye had all the scriptures which give an

140
00:06:42,732 --> 00:06:46,732
 account of all the marvelous works of Christ, ye

141
00:06:46,732 --> 00:06:50,732
 would, according to the words of Christ, know that

142
00:06:50,732 --> 00:06:54,732
 these things must surely come

143
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:57,348
34 And wo be unto him that will not hearken unto

144
00:06:57,348 --> 00:07:00,015
 the words of Jesus, and also to them whom he hath

145
00:07:00,015 --> 00:07:02,682
 chosen and sent among them; for whoso receiveth not

146
00:07:02,682 --> 00:07:05,349
 the words of Jesus and the words of those whom he

147
00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:08,016
 hath sent receiveth not him; and therefore he

148
00:07:08,016 --> 00:07:10,683
 will not receive them at the last day

149
00:07:10,63 --> 00:07:12,23
35 And it would be better for them if they had not

150
00:07:12,23 --> 00:07:13,83
 been born. For do ye suppose that ye can get rid

151
00:07:13,83 --> 00:07:15,43
 of the justice of an offended God, who hath been

152
00:07:15,43 --> 00:07:17,03
 trampled under feet of men, that thereby salvation

153
00:07:17,03 --> 00:07:18,63
 might come

154
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,205
36 And now behold, as I spake concerning those

155
00:07:20,205 --> 00:07:21,805
 whom the Lord hath chosen, yea, even three who were

156
00:07:21,805 --> 00:07:23,405
 caught up into the heavens, that I knew not whether

157
00:07:23,405 --> 00:07:25,005
 they were cleansed from mortality to immortality

158
00:07:25,005 --> 00:07:26,605


159
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:31,379
37 But behold, since I wrote, I have inquired of

160
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:36,179
 the Lord, and he hath made it manifest unto me that

161
00:07:36,179 --> 00:07:40,979
 there must needs be a change wrought upon their

162
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:45,779
 bodies, or else it needs be that they must taste of

163
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:50,579
 death

164
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:52,503
38 Therefore, that they might not taste of death

165
00:07:52,503 --> 00:07:54,503
 there was a change wrought upon their bodies, that

166
00:07:54,503 --> 00:07:56,503
 they might not suffer pain nor sorrow save it were

167
00:07:56,503 --> 00:07:58,503
 for the sins of the world

168
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:03,049
39 Now this change was not equal to that which

169
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:07,62
 shall take place at the last day; but there was a

170
00:08:07,62 --> 00:08:12,191
 change wrought upon them, insomuch that Satan could

171
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:16,762
 have no power over them, that he could not tempt

172
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:21,333
 them; and they were sanctified in the flesh, that

173
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:25,904
 they were holy, and that the powers of the earth

174
00:08:25,904 --> 00:08:30,475
 could not hold them

175
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:30,577
40 And in this state they were to remain until the

176
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:30,777
 judgment day of Christ; and at that day they were

177
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:30,977
 to receive a greater change, and to be received

178
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:31,177
 into the kingdom of the Father to go no more out,

179
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:31,377
 but to dwell with God eternally in the heavens.
