Chapter 9 In the darkness, the voice of Christ

2
00:00:07,667 --> 00:00:15,334
 proclaims the destruction of many people and cities

3
00:00:15,334 --> 00:00:23,001
 for their wickednessâ€”He also proclaims His

4
00:00:23,001 --> 00:00:30,668
 divinity, announces that the law of Moses is fulfilled,

5
00:00:30,668 --> 00:00:38,335
 and invites men to come unto Him and be saved. About

7
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:51,914
1 And it came to pass that there was a voice heard

8
00:00:51,914 --> 00:00:56,914
 among all the inhabitants of the earth, upon all

9
00:00:56,914 --> 00:01:01,914
 the face of this land, crying

10
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:09,828
2 Wo, wo, wo unto this people; wo unto the

11
00:01:09,828 --> 00:01:17,661
 inhabitants of the whole earth except they shall repent;

12
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:25,494
 for the devil laugheth, and his angels rejoice,

13
00:01:25,494 --> 00:01:33,327
 because of the slain of the fair sons and daughters

14
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:41,16
 of my people; and it is because of their iniquity

15
00:01:41,16 --> 00:01:48,993
 and abominations that they are fallen

16
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:53,675
3 Behold, that great city Zarahemla have I burned

17
00:01:53,675 --> 00:01:59,175
 with fire, and the inhabitants thereof

18
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:20,186
4 And behold, that great city Moroni have I caused

19
00:02:20,186 --> 00:02:41,186
 to be sunk in the depths of the sea, and the

20
00:02:41,186 --> 00:03:02,186
 inhabitants thereof to be drowned

21
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:05,65
5 And behold, that great city Moronihah have I

22
00:03:05,65 --> 00:03:08,317
 covered with earth, and the inhabitants thereof, to

23
00:03:08,317 --> 00:03:10,984
 hide their iniquities and their abominations from

24
00:03:10,984 --> 00:03:13,651
 before my face, that the blood of the prophets and

25
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:16,318
 the saints shall not come any more unto me against

26
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:18,985
 them

27
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:37,599
6 And behold, the city of Gilgal have I caused to

28
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:56,266
 be sunk, and the inhabitants thereof to be buried

29
00:03:56,266 --> 00:04:14,933
 up in the depths of the earth

30
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:15,005
7 Yea, and the city of Onihah and the inhabitants

31
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:15,255
 thereof, and the city of Mocum and the inhabitants

32
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:15,505
 thereof, and the city of Jerusalem and the

33
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:15,755
 inhabitants thereof; and waters have I caused to come up

34
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:16,005
 in the stead thereof, to hide their wickedness

35
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:16,255
 and abominations from before my face, that the blood

36
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:16,505
 of the prophets and the saints shall not come up

37
00:04:16,505 --> 00:04:16,755
 any more unto me against them

38
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:20,767
8 And behold, the city of Gadiandi, and the city

39
00:04:20,767 --> 00:04:25,211
 of Gadiomnah, and the city of Jacob, and the city

40
00:04:25,211 --> 00:04:29,655
 of Gimgimno, all these have I caused to be sunk,

41
00:04:29,655 --> 00:04:34,099
 and made hills and valleys in the places thereof;

42
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:38,543
 and the inhabitants thereof have I buried up in the

43
00:04:38,543 --> 00:04:42,987
 depths of the earth, to hide their wickedness and

44
00:04:42,987 --> 00:04:47,431
 abominations from before my face, that the blood

45
00:04:47,431 --> 00:04:51,875
 of the prophets and the saints should not come up

46
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:56,319
 any more unto me against them

47
00:04:56,797 --> 00:05:01,706
9 And behold, that great city Jacobugath, which

48
00:05:01,706 --> 00:05:06,615
 was inhabited by the people of king Jacob, have I

49
00:05:06,615 --> 00:05:11,524
 caused to be burned with fire because of their sins

50
00:05:11,524 --> 00:05:16,433
 and their wickedness, which was above all the

51
00:05:16,433 --> 00:05:21,342
 wickedness of the whole earth, because of their secret

52
00:05:21,342 --> 00:05:26,251
 murders and combinations; for it was they that

53
00:05:26,251 --> 00:05:31,16
 did destroy the peace of my people and the

54
00:05:31,16 --> 00:05:36,069
 government of the land; therefore I did cause them to be

55
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:40,978
 burned, to destroy them from before my face, that

56
00:05:40,978 --> 00:05:45,887
 the blood of the prophets and the saints should not

57
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:50,796
 come up unto me any more against them

58
00:05:50,65 --> 00:05:56,507
10 And behold, the city of Laman, and the city of

59
00:05:56,507 --> 00:06:02,364
 Josh, and the city of Gad, and the city of

60
00:06:02,364 --> 00:06:08,221
 Kishkumen, have I caused to be burned with fire, and the

61
00:06:08,221 --> 00:06:14,078
 inhabitants thereof, because of their wickedness

62
00:06:14,078 --> 00:06:19,935
 in casting out the prophets, and stoning those whom

63
00:06:19,935 --> 00:06:25,792
 I did send to declare unto them concerning their

64
00:06:25,792 --> 00:06:31,649
 wickedness and their abominations

65
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:37,911
11 And because they did cast them all out, that

66
00:06:37,911 --> 00:06:44,197
 there were none righteous among them, I did send

67
00:06:44,197 --> 00:06:50,483
 down fire and destroy them, that their wickedness and

68
00:06:50,483 --> 00:06:56,769
 abominations might be hid from before my face,

69
00:06:56,769 --> 00:07:03,055
 that the blood of the prophets and the saints whom I

70
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:09,341
 sent among them might not cry unto me from the

71
00:07:09,341 --> 00:07:15,627
 ground against them

72
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:21,935
12 And many great destructions have I caused to

73
00:07:21,935 --> 00:07:28,268
 come upon this land, and upon this people, because

74
00:07:28,268 --> 00:07:34,601
 of their wickedness and their abominations

75
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:39,904
13 O all ye that are spared because ye were more

76
00:07:39,904 --> 00:07:45,654
 righteous than they, will ye not now return unto

77
00:07:45,654 --> 00:07:51,404
 me, and repent of your sins, and be converted, that

78
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:57,154
 I may heal you

79
00:07:57,844 --> 00:08:03,644
14 Yea, verily I say unto you, if ye will come

80
00:08:03,644 --> 00:08:09,444
 unto me ye shall have eternal life. Behold, mine arm

81
00:08:09,444 --> 00:08:15,244
 of mercy is extended towards you, and whosoever

82
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:21,044
 will come, him will I receive; and blessed are those

83
00:08:21,044 --> 00:08:26,844
 who come unto me

84
00:08:26,74 --> 00:08:33,94
15 Behold, I am Jesus Christ the Son of God. I

85
00:08:33,94 --> 00:08:41,14
 created the heavens and the earth, and all things

86
00:08:41,14 --> 00:08:48,34
 that in them are. I was with the Father from the

87
00:08:48,34 --> 00:08:55,54
 beginning. I am in the Father, and the Father in me;

88
00:08:55,54 --> 00:09:02,74
 and in me hath the Father glorified his name

89
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:09,076
16 I came unto my own, and my own received me not.

90
00:09:09,076 --> 00:09:15,743
 And the scriptures concerning my coming are

91
00:09:15,743 --> 00:09:22,41
 fulfilled

92
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:27,562
17 And as many as have received me, to them have I

93
00:09:27,562 --> 00:09:32,962
 given to become the sons of God; and even so will

94
00:09:32,962 --> 00:09:38,362
 I to as many as shall believe on my name, for

95
00:09:38,362 --> 00:09:43,762
 behold, by me redemption cometh, and in me is the law

96
00:09:43,762 --> 00:09:49,162
 of Moses fulfilled

97
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:57,856
18 I am the light and the life of the world. I am

98
00:09:57,856 --> 00:10:05,856
 Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end

99
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:11,805
19 And ye shall offer up unto me no more the

100
00:10:11,805 --> 00:10:18,305
 shedding of blood; yea, your sacrifices and your burnt

101
00:10:18,305 --> 00:10:24,805
 offerings shall be done away, for I will accept

102
00:10:24,805 --> 00:10:31,305
 none of your sacrifices and your burnt offerings

103
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:37,022
20 And ye shall offer for a sacrifice unto me a

104
00:10:37,022 --> 00:10:42,647
 broken heart and a contrite spirit. And whoso cometh

105
00:10:42,647 --> 00:10:48,272
 unto me with a broken heart and a contrite

106
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:53,897
 spirit, him will I baptize with fire and with the Holy

107
00:10:53,897 --> 00:10:59,522
 Ghost, even as the Lamanites, because of their

108
00:10:59,522 --> 00:11:05,147
 faith in me at the time of their conversion, were

109
00:11:05,147 --> 00:11:10,772
 baptized with fire and with the Holy Ghost, and they

110
00:11:10,772 --> 00:11:16,397
 knew it not

111
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:22,443
21 Behold, I have come unto the world to bring

112
00:11:22,443 --> 00:11:28,11
 redemption unto the world, to save the world from

113
00:11:28,11 --> 00:11:33,777
 sin

114
00:11:33,56 --> 00:11:39,56
22 Therefore, whoso repenteth and cometh unto me

115
00:11:39,56 --> 00:11:45,56
 as a little child, him will I receive, for of such

116
00:11:45,56 --> 00:11:51,56
 is the kingdom of God. Behold, for such I have

117
00:11:51,56 --> 00:11:57,56
 laid down my life, and have taken it up again;

118
00:11:57,56 --> 00:12:03,56
 therefore repent, and come unto me ye ends of the earth,

119
00:12:03,56 --> 00:12:09,56
 and be saved.
