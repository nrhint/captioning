00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 9 In the darkness, the voice of

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Christ proclaims the destruction of many

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
people and cities for their wickedness—He also

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
proclaims His divinity, announces that the

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
law of Moses is fulfilled, and invites men

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:10:09,
to come unto Him and be saved. About A.D. 34. 

7
00:10:09,0 --> 00:10:09,0
1 And it came to pass that there

8
00:10:09,0 --> 00:10:09,0
was a voice heard among all the

9
00:10:09,0 --> 00:10:09,0
inhabitants of the earth, upon

10
00:10:09,0 --> 00:13:54,
all the face of this land, crying:

11
00:13:54,0 --> 00:13:54,0
2 Wo, wo, wo unto this people;

12
00:13:54,0 --> 00:13:54,0
wo unto the inhabitants of the

13
00:13:54,0 --> 00:13:54,0
whole earth except they shall

14
00:13:54,0 --> 00:13:54,0
repent; for the devil laugheth, and

15
00:13:54,0 --> 00:13:54,0
his angels rejoice, because of

16
00:13:54,0 --> 00:13:54,0
the slain of the fair sons and

17
00:13:54,0 --> 00:13:54,0
daughters of my people; and it is

18
00:13:54,0 --> 00:13:54,0
because of their iniquity and

19
00:13:54,0 --> 00:21:38,
abominations that they are fallen!

20
00:21:38,0 --> 00:21:38,0
3 Behold, that great city

21
00:21:38,0 --> 00:21:38,0
Zarahemla have I burned with

22
00:21:38,0 --> 00:22:50,
fire, and the inhabitants thereof.

23
00:22:50,0 --> 00:22:50,0
4 And behold, that great

24
00:22:50,0 --> 00:22:50,0
city Moroni have I caused

25
00:22:50,0 --> 00:22:50,0
to be sunk in the depths of

26
00:22:50,0 --> 00:22:50,0
the sea, and the

27
00:22:50,0 --> 00:26:20,
inhabitants thereof to be drowned.

28
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
5 And behold, that great

29
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
city Moronihah have I

30
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
covered with earth, and the

31
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
inhabitants thereof, to

32
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
hide their iniquities and

33
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
their abominations from

34
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
before my face, that the

35
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
blood of the prophets and

36
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
the saints shall not come

37
00:26:20,0 --> 00:28:32,
any more unto me against them.

38
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
6 And behold, the

39
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
city of Gilgal have I

40
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
caused to be sunk, and

41
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
the inhabitants

42
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
thereof to be buried up in

43
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:46,
the depths of the earth;

44
00:28:46,0 --> 00:28:46,0
7 Yea, and the city

45
00:28:46,0 --> 00:28:46,0
of Onihah and the

46
00:28:46,0 --> 00:28:46,0
inhabitants thereof,

47

and the city of Mocum

48

51
00:28:46,0 --> 00:28:46,0
the inhabitants

52
00:28:46,0 --> 00:28:46,0
thereof; and waters have

53
00:28:46,0 --> 00:28:46,0
I caused to come up

54
00:28:46,0 --> 00:28:46,0
in the stead

55
00:28:46,0 --> 00:28:46,0
thereof, to hide their

56
00:28:46,0 --> 00:28:46,0
wickedness and

57
00:28:46,0 --> 00:28:46,0
abominations from before my

58
00:28:46,0 --> 00:28:46,0
face, that the blood

59
00:28:46,0 --> 00:28:46,0
of the prophets and

60
00:28:46,0 --> 00:28:46,0
the saints shall

61
00:28:46,0 --> 00:28:46,0
not come up any more

62
00:28:46,0 --> 00:28:18,
unto me against them.

63
00:28:18,0 --> 00:28:18,0
8 And behold, the

64

city of Gimgimno,

69
00:28:18,0 --> 00:28:18,0
all these have I

70
00:28:18,0 --> 00:28:18,0
caused to be sunk, and

71
00:28:18,0 --> 00:28:18,0
made hills and

72
00:28:18,0 --> 00:28:18,0
valleys in the places

73
00:28:18,0 --> 00:28:18,0
thereof; and the

74
00:28:18,0 --> 00:28:18,0
inhabitants thereof

75
00:28:18,0 --> 00:28:18,0
have I buried up in

76
00:28:18,0 --> 00:28:18,0
the depths of the

77
00:28:18,0 --> 00:28:18,0
earth, to hide their

78
00:28:18,0 --> 00:28:18,0
wickedness and

79
00:28:18,0 --> 00:28:18,0
abominations from

80
00:28:18,0 --> 00:28:18,0
before my face, that the

81
00:28:18,0 --> 00:28:18,0
blood of the

82
00:28:18,0 --> 00:28:18,0
prophets and the saints

83
00:28:18,0 --> 00:28:18,0
should not come up

84
00:28:18,0 --> 00:29:30,
any more unto me against them.

85
00:29:30,0 --> 00:29:30,0
9 And behold, that

86
00:29:30,0 --> 00:29:30,0
great city

87
00:29:30,0 --> 00:29:30,0
Jacobugath, which was

88
00:29:30,0 --> 00:29:30,0
inhabited by the

89
00:29:30,0 --> 00:29:30,0
people of king Jacob,

90
00:29:30,0 --> 00:29:30,0
have I caused to

91
00:29:30,0 --> 00:29:30,0
be burned with

92
00:29:30,0 --> 00:29:30,0
fire because of their

93
00:29:30,0 --> 00:29:30,0
sins and their

94
00:29:30,0 --> 00:29:30,0
wickedness, which

95
00:29:30,0 --> 00:29:30,0
was above all the

96
00:29:30,0 --> 00:29:30,0
wickedness of the

97
00:29:30,0 --> 00:29:30,0
whole earth, because

98
00:29:30,0 --> 00:29:30,0
of their secret

99
00:29:30,0 --> 00:29:30,0
murders and

100
00:29:30,0 --> 00:29:30,0
combinations; for it was

101
00:29:30,0 --> 00:29:30,0
they that did

102
00:29:30,0 --> 00:29:30,0
destroy the peace of

103
00:29:30,0 --> 00:29:30,0
my people and the

104
00:29:30,0 --> 00:29:30,0
government of the

105
00:29:30,0 --> 00:29:30,0
land; therefore I

106
00:29:30,0 --> 00:29:30,0
did cause them to

107
00:29:30,0 --> 00:29:30,0
be burned, to

108
00:29:30,0 --> 00:29:30,0
destroy them from

109
00:29:30,0 --> 00:29:30,0
before my face, that

110
00:29:30,0 --> 00:29:30,0
the blood of the

111
00:29:30,0 --> 00:29:30,0
prophets and the

112
00:29:30,0 --> 00:29:30,0
saints should not come

113
00:29:30,0 --> 00:31:42,
up unto me any more against them.

114
00:31:42,0 --> 00:31:42,0
10 And behold,

115
00:31:42,0 --> 00:31:42,0
the city of Laman,

116
00:31:42,0 --> 00:31:42,0
and the city of

117
00:31:42,0 --> 00:31:42,0
Josh, and the city

118
00:31:42,0 --> 00:31:42,0
of Gad, and the

119
00:31:42,0 --> 00:31:42,0
city of

120
00:31:42,0 --> 00:31:42,0
Kishkumen, have I caused

121
00:31:42,0 --> 00:31:42,0
to be burned with

122
00:31:42,0 --> 00:31:42,0
fire, and the

123
00:31:42,0 --> 00:31:42,0
inhabitants thereof,

124
00:31:42,0 --> 00:31:42,0
because of their

125
00:31:42,0 --> 00:31:42,0
wickedness in

126
00:31:42,0 --> 00:31:42,0
casting out the

127
00:31:42,0 --> 00:31:42,0
prophets, and

128
00:31:42,0 --> 00:31:42,0
stoning those whom I

129
00:31:42,0 --> 00:31:42,0
did send to declare

130
00:31:42,0 --> 00:31:42,0
unto them

131
00:31:42,0 --> 00:31:42,0
concerning their

132
00:31:42,0 --> 00:35:55,
wickedness and their abominations.

133
00:35:55,0 --> 00:35:55,0
11 And because

134
00:35:55,0 --> 00:35:55,0
they did cast

135
00:35:55,0 --> 00:35:55,0
them all out, that

136
00:35:55,0 --> 00:35:55,0
there were none

137
00:35:55,0 --> 00:35:55,0
righteous among

138
00:35:55,0 --> 00:35:55,0
them, I did send

139
00:35:55,0 --> 00:35:55,0
down fire and

140
00:35:55,0 --> 00:35:55,0
destroy them,

141
00:35:55,0 --> 00:35:55,0
that their

142
00:35:55,0 --> 00:35:55,0
wickedness and

143
00:35:55,0 --> 00:35:55,0
abominations might be hid

144
00:35:55,0 --> 00:35:55,0
from before my

145
00:35:55,0 --> 00:35:55,0
face, that the

146
00:35:55,0 --> 00:35:55,0
blood of the

147
00:35:55,0 --> 00:35:55,0
prophets and the

148
00:35:55,0 --> 00:35:55,0
saints whom I sent

149
00:35:55,0 --> 00:35:55,0
among them might

150
00:35:55,0 --> 00:35:55,0
not cry unto me

151
00:35:55,0 --> 00:38:07,
from the ground against them.

152
00:38:07,0 --> 00:38:07,0
12 And many

153
00:38:07,0 --> 00:38:07,0
great destructions

154
00:38:07,0 --> 00:38:07,0
have I caused

155
00:38:07,0 --> 00:38:07,0
to come upon

156
00:38:07,0 --> 00:38:07,0
this land, and

157
00:38:07,0 --> 00:38:07,0
upon this people,

158
00:38:07,0 --> 00:38:07,0
because of

159
00:38:07,0 --> 00:38:07,0
their wickedness

160
00:38:07,0 --> 00:45:51,
and their abominations.

161
00:45:51,0 --> 00:45:51,0
13 O all ye

162
00:45:51,0 --> 00:45:51,0
that are spared

163
00:45:51,0 --> 00:45:51,0
because ye were

164
00:45:51,0 --> 00:45:51,0
more righteous

165
00:45:51,0 --> 00:45:51,0
than they, will

166
00:45:51,0 --> 00:45:51,0
ye not now

167
00:45:51,0 --> 00:45:51,0
return unto me, and

168
00:45:51,0 --> 00:45:51,0
repent of your

169
00:45:51,0 --> 00:45:51,0
sins, and be

170
00:45:51,0 --> 00:45:51,0
converted, that

171
00:45:51,0 --> 00:48:03,
I may heal you?

172
00:48:03,0 --> 00:48:03,0
14 Yea, verily

173
00:48:03,0 --> 00:48:03,0
I say unto

174
00:48:03,0 --> 00:48:03,0
you, if ye will

175
00:48:03,0 --> 00:48:03,0
come unto me

176
00:48:03,0 --> 00:48:03,0
ye shall have

177
00:48:03,0 --> 00:48:03,0
eternal life.

178
00:48:03,0 --> 00:48:03,0
Behold, mine

179
00:48:03,0 --> 00:48:03,0
arm of mercy is

180
00:48:03,0 --> 00:48:03,0
extended

181
00:48:03,0 --> 00:48:03,0
towards you, and

182
00:48:03,0 --> 00:48:03,0
whosoever will

183
00:48:03,0 --> 00:48:03,0
come, him will

184
00:48:03,0 --> 00:48:03,0
I receive; and

185
00:48:03,0 --> 00:48:03,0
blessed are

186
00:48:03,0 --> 00:56:45,
those who come unto me.

187
00:56:45,0 --> 00:56:45,0
15 Behold, I

188
00:56:45,0 --> 00:56:45,0
am Jesus

189
00:56:45,0 --> 00:56:45,0
Christ the Son of

190
00:56:45,0 --> 00:56:45,0
God. I

191
00:56:45,0 --> 00:56:45,0
created the

192
00:56:45,0 --> 00:56:45,0
heavens and the

193
00:56:45,0 --> 00:56:45,0
earth, and all

194
00:56:45,0 --> 00:56:45,0
things that in

195
00:56:45,0 --> 00:56:45,0
them are. I

196
00:56:45,0 --> 00:56:45,0
was with the

197
00:56:45,0 --> 00:56:45,0
Father from

198
00:56:45,0 --> 00:56:45,0
the beginning.

199
00:56:45,0 --> 00:56:45,0
I am in the

200
00:56:45,0 --> 00:56:45,0
Father, and

201
00:56:45,0 --> 00:56:45,0
the Father in

202
00:56:45,0 --> 00:56:45,0
me; and in me

203
00:56:45,0 --> 00:56:45,0
hath the

204
00:56:45,0 --> 00:56:17,
Father glorified his name.

205
00:56:17,0 --> 00:56:17,0
16 I came

206
00:56:17,0 --> 00:56:17,0
unto my own,

207
00:56:17,0 --> 00:56:17,0
and my own

208
00:56:17,0 --> 00:56:17,0
received

209
00:56:17,0 --> 00:56:17,0
me not. And

210
00:56:17,0 --> 00:56:17,0
the

211
00:56:17,0 --> 00:56:17,0
scriptures

212
00:56:17,0 --> 00:56:17,0
concerning my

213
00:56:17,0 --> 00:55:49,
coming are fulfilled.

214
00:55:49,0 --> 00:55:49,0
17 And as

215
00:55:49,0 --> 00:55:49,0
many as have

216
00:55:49,0 --> 00:55:49,0
received

217
00:55:49,0 --> 00:55:49,0
me, to them

218
00:55:49,0 --> 00:55:49,0
have I

219
00:55:49,0 --> 00:55:49,0
given to become

220
00:55:49,0 --> 00:55:49,0
the sons

221
00:55:49,0 --> 00:55:49,0
of God; and

222
00:55:49,0 --> 00:55:49,0
