00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:06,833
Chapter 9 In the darkness, the voice of

2
00:00:06,833 --> 00:00:13,666
Christ proclaims the destruction of many

3
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:20,499
people and cities for their wickedness—He also

4
00:00:20,499 --> 00:00:27,332
proclaims His divinity, announces that the

5
00:00:27,332 --> 00:00:34,165
law of Moses is fulfilled, and invites men

6
00:00:34,165 --> 00:00:41,341
to come unto Him and be saved. About A.D. 34. 

7
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:42,591
1 And it came to pass that there

8
00:00:42,591 --> 00:00:43,841
was a voice heard among all the

9
00:00:43,841 --> 00:00:45,091
inhabitants of the earth, upon

10
00:00:45,091 --> 00:00:46,747
all the face of this land, crying:

11
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:48,414
2 Wo, wo, wo unto this people;

12
00:00:48,414 --> 00:00:50,081
wo unto the inhabitants of the

13
00:00:50,081 --> 00:00:51,748
whole earth except they shall

14
00:00:51,748 --> 00:00:53,415
repent; for the devil laugheth, and

15
00:00:53,415 --> 00:00:55,082
his angels rejoice, because of

16
00:00:55,082 --> 00:00:56,749
the slain of the fair sons and

17
00:00:56,749 --> 00:00:58,416
daughters of my people; and it is

18
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:00,083
because of their iniquity and

19
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:01,762
abominations that they are fallen!

20
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:04,095
3 Behold, that great city

21
00:01:04,095 --> 00:01:06,428
Zarahemla have I burned with

22
00:01:06,428 --> 00:01:08,769
fire, and the inhabitants thereof.

23
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:10,569
4 And behold, that great

24
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:12,369
city Moroni have I caused

25
00:01:12,369 --> 00:01:14,169
to be sunk in the depths of

26
00:01:14,169 --> 00:01:15,969
the sea, and the

27
00:01:15,969 --> 00:01:17,177
inhabitants thereof to be drowned.

28
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:19,777
5 And behold, that great

29
00:01:19,777 --> 00:01:22,377
city Moronihah have I

30
00:01:22,377 --> 00:01:24,977
covered with earth, and the

31
00:01:24,977 --> 00:01:27,577
inhabitants thereof, to

32
00:01:27,577 --> 00:01:30,177
hide their iniquities and

33
00:01:30,177 --> 00:01:32,777
their abominations from

34
00:01:32,777 --> 00:01:35,377
before my face, that the

35
00:01:35,377 --> 00:01:37,977
blood of the prophets and

36
00:01:37,977 --> 00:01:40,577
the saints shall not come

37
00:01:40,577 --> 00:01:43,503
any more unto me against them.

38
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:43,503
6 And behold, the

39
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:43,503
city of Gilgal have I

40
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:43,503
caused to be sunk, and

41
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:43,503
the inhabitants

42
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:43,503
thereof to be buried up in

43
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:43,036
the depths of the earth;

44
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:43,141
7 Yea, and the city

45
00:01:43,141 --> 00:01:43,246
of Onihah and the

46
00:01:43,246 --> 00:01:43,351
inhabitants thereof,

and the city of Mocum

48
00:01:43,456 --> 00:01:43,561

49
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:43,666
thereof, and the

50
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:43,771
city of Jerusalem and

51
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:43,876
the inhabitants

52
00:01:43,876 --> 00:01:43,981
thereof; and waters have

53
00:01:43,981 --> 00:01:44,086
I caused to come up

54
00:01:44,086 --> 00:01:44,191
in the stead

55
00:01:44,191 --> 00:01:44,296
thereof, to hide their

56
00:01:44,296 --> 00:01:44,401
wickedness and

57
00:01:44,401 --> 00:01:44,506
abominations from before my

58
00:01:44,506 --> 00:01:44,611
face, that the blood

59
00:01:44,611 --> 00:01:44,716
of the prophets and

60
00:01:44,716 --> 00:01:44,821
the saints shall

61
00:01:44,821 --> 00:01:44,926
not come up any more

62
00:01:44,926 --> 00:01:45,439
unto me against them.

63
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,075
8 And behold, the

64
00:01:46,075 --> 00:01:46,711
city of Gadiandi,

65
00:01:46,711 --> 00:01:47,347

city of Gimgimno,

69
00:01:49,255 --> 00:01:49,891
all these have I

70
00:01:49,891 --> 00:01:50,527
caused to be sunk, and

71
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:51,163
made hills and

72
00:01:51,163 --> 00:01:51,799
valleys in the places

73
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:52,435
thereof; and the

74
00:01:52,435 --> 00:01:53,071
inhabitants thereof

75
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:53,707
have I buried up in

76
00:01:53,707 --> 00:01:54,343
the depths of the

77
00:01:54,343 --> 00:01:54,979
earth, to hide their

78
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:55,615
wickedness and

79
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:56,251
abominations from

80
00:01:56,251 --> 00:01:56,887
before my face, that the

81
00:01:56,887 --> 00:01:57,523
blood of the

82
00:01:57,523 --> 00:01:58,159
prophets and the saints

83
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:58,795
should not come up

84
00:01:58,795 --> 00:01:59,753
any more unto me against them.

85
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:00,339
9 And behold, that

86
00:02:00,339 --> 00:02:00,925
great city

87
00:02:00,925 --> 00:02:01,511
Jacobugath, which was

88
00:02:01,511 --> 00:02:02,097
inhabited by the

89
00:02:02,097 --> 00:02:02,683
people of king Jacob,

90
00:02:02,683 --> 00:02:03,269
have I caused to

91
00:02:03,269 --> 00:02:03,855
be burned with

92
00:02:03,855 --> 00:02:04,441
fire because of their

93
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:05,027
sins and their

94
00:02:05,027 --> 00:02:05,613
wickedness, which

95
00:02:05,613 --> 00:02:06,199
was above all the

96
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:06,785
wickedness of the

97
00:02:06,785 --> 00:02:07,371
whole earth, because

98
00:02:07,371 --> 00:02:07,957
of their secret

99
00:02:07,957 --> 00:02:08,543
murders and

100
00:02:08,543 --> 00:02:09,129
combinations; for it was

101
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:09,715
they that did

102
00:02:09,715 --> 00:02:10,301
destroy the peace of

103
00:02:10,301 --> 00:02:10,887
my people and the

104
00:02:10,887 --> 00:02:11,473
government of the

105
00:02:11,473 --> 00:02:12,059
land; therefore I

106
00:02:12,059 --> 00:02:12,645
did cause them to

107
00:02:12,645 --> 00:02:13,231
be burned, to

108
00:02:13,231 --> 00:02:13,817
destroy them from

109
00:02:13,817 --> 00:02:14,403
before my face, that

110
00:02:14,403 --> 00:02:14,989
the blood of the

111
00:02:14,989 --> 00:02:15,575
prophets and the

112
00:02:15,575 --> 00:02:16,161
saints should not come

113
00:02:16,161 --> 00:02:16,169
up unto me any more against them.

114
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:17,801
10 And behold,

115
00:02:17,801 --> 00:02:19,433
the city of Laman,

116
00:02:19,433 --> 00:02:21,065
and the city of

117
00:02:21,065 --> 00:02:22,697
Josh, and the city

118
00:02:22,697 --> 00:02:24,329
of Gad, and the

119
00:02:24,329 --> 00:02:25,961
city of

120
00:02:25,961 --> 00:02:27,593
Kishkumen, have I caused

121
00:02:27,593 --> 00:02:29,225
to be burned with

122
00:02:29,225 --> 00:02:30,857
fire, and the

123
00:02:30,857 --> 00:02:32,489
inhabitants thereof,

124
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:34,121
because of their

125
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:35,753
wickedness in

126
00:02:35,753 --> 00:02:37,385
casting out the

127
00:02:37,385 --> 00:02:39,017
prophets, and

128
00:02:39,017 --> 00:02:40,649
stoning those whom I

129
00:02:40,649 --> 00:02:42,281
did send to declare

130
00:02:42,281 --> 00:02:43,913
unto them

131
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,545
concerning their

132
00:02:45,545 --> 00:02:47,601
wickedness and their abominations.

133
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:48,338
11 And because

134
00:02:48,338 --> 00:02:49,075
they did cast

135
00:02:49,075 --> 00:02:49,812
them all out, that

136
00:02:49,812 --> 00:02:50,549
there were none

137
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:51,286
righteous among

138
00:02:51,286 --> 00:02:52,023
them, I did send

139
00:02:52,023 --> 00:02:52,76
down fire and

140
00:02:52,76 --> 00:02:53,497
destroy them,

141
00:02:53,497 --> 00:02:54,234
that their

142
00:02:54,234 --> 00:02:54,971
wickedness and

143
00:02:54,971 --> 00:02:55,708
abominations might be hid

144
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:56,445
from before my

145
00:02:56,445 --> 00:02:57,182
face, that the

146
00:02:57,182 --> 00:02:57,919
blood of the

147
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:58,656
prophets and the

148
00:02:58,656 --> 00:02:59,393
saints whom I sent

149
00:02:59,393 --> 00:03:00,13
among them might

150
00:03:00,13 --> 00:03:00,867
not cry unto me

151
00:03:00,867 --> 00:03:01,915
from the ground against them.

152
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:01,804
12 And many

153
00:03:01,804 --> 00:03:01,693
great destructions

154
00:03:01,693 --> 00:03:01,582
have I caused

155
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:01,471
to come upon

156
00:03:01,471 --> 00:03:01,36
this land, and

157
00:03:01,36 --> 00:03:01,249
upon this people,

158
00:03:01,249 --> 00:03:01,138
because of

159
00:03:01,138 --> 00:03:01,027
their wickedness

160
00:03:01,027 --> 00:03:00,981
and their abominations.

161
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:00,981
13 O all ye

162
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:00,981
that are spared

163
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:00,981
because ye were

164
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:00,981
more righteous

165
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:00,981
than they, will

166
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:00,981
ye not now

167
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:00,981
return unto me, and

168
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:00,981
repent of your

169
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:00,981
sins, and be

170
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:00,981
converted, that

171
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:00,047
I may heal you?

172
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:00,18
14 Yea, verily

173
00:03:00,18 --> 00:03:00,313
I say unto

174
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:00,446
you, if ye will

175
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:00,579
come unto me

176
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:00,712
ye shall have

177
00:03:00,712 --> 00:03:00,845
eternal life.

178
00:03:00,845 --> 00:03:00,978
Behold, mine

179
00:03:00,978 --> 00:03:01,111
arm of mercy is

180
00:03:01,111 --> 00:03:01,244
extended

181
00:03:01,244 --> 00:03:01,377
towards you, and

182
00:03:01,377 --> 00:03:01,51
whosoever will

183
00:03:01,51 --> 00:03:01,643
come, him will

184
00:03:01,643 --> 00:03:01,776
I receive; and

185
00:03:01,776 --> 00:03:01,909
blessed are

186
00:03:01,909 --> 00:03:02,449
those who come unto me.

187
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:02,727
15 Behold, I

188
00:03:02,727 --> 00:03:03,005
am Jesus

189
00:03:03,005 --> 00:03:03,283
Christ the Son of

190
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:03,561
God. I

191
00:03:03,561 --> 00:03:03,839
created the

192
00:03:03,839 --> 00:03:04,117
heavens and the

193
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:04,395
earth, and all

194
00:03:04,395 --> 00:03:04,673
things that in

195
00:03:04,673 --> 00:03:04,951
them are. I

196
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:05,229
was with the

197
00:03:05,229 --> 00:03:05,507
Father from

198
00:03:05,507 --> 00:03:05,785
the beginning.

199
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:06,063
I am in the

200
