00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,4
Chapter 29 The coming forth of the Book of Mormon

2
00:00:01,4 --> 00:00:02,8
 is a sign that the Lord has commenced to gather

3
00:00:02,8 --> 00:00:04,2
 Israel and fulfill His covenants—Those who reject

4
00:00:04,2 --> 00:00:05,6
 His latter-day revelations and gifts will be cursed.

5
00:00:05,6 --> 00:00:07,0
 About A.D. 34–35.

6
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,118
1 And now behold, I say unto you that when the

7
00:00:09,118 --> 00:00:10,261
 Lord shall see fit, in his wisdom, that these sayings

8
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:11,404
 shall come unto the Gentiles according to his

9
00:00:11,404 --> 00:00:12,547
 word, then ye may know that the covenant which the

10
00:00:12,547 --> 00:00:13,69
 Father hath made with the children of Israel,

11
00:00:13,69 --> 00:00:14,833
 concerning their restoration to the lands of their

12
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:15,976
 inheritance, is already beginning to be fulfilled

13
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:19,949
2 And ye may know that the words of the Lord,

14
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:23,949
 which have been spoken by the holy prophets, shall all

15
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:27,949
 be fulfilled; and ye need not say that the Lord

16
00:00:27,949 --> 00:00:31,949
 delays his coming unto the children of Israel

17
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:37,899
3 And ye need not imagine in your hearts that the

18
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:43,899
 words which have been spoken are vain, for behold,

19
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:49,899
 the Lord will remember his covenant which he hath

20
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:55,899
 made unto his people of the house of Israel

21
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,155
4 And when ye shall see these sayings coming forth

22
00:00:57,155 --> 00:00:58,488
 among you, then ye need not any longer spurn at

23
00:00:58,488 --> 00:00:59,821
 the doings of the Lord, for the sword of his

24
00:00:59,821 --> 00:01:01,154
 justice is in his right hand; and behold, at that day,

25
00:01:01,154 --> 00:01:02,487
 if ye shall spurn at his doings he will cause that

26
00:01:02,487 --> 00:01:03,82
 it shall soon overtake you

27
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:06,464
5 Wo unto him that spurneth at the doings of the

28
00:01:06,464 --> 00:01:09,131
 Lord; yea, wo unto him that shall deny the Christ

29
00:01:09,131 --> 00:01:11,798
 and his works

30
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:14,972
6 Yea, wo unto him that shall deny the revelations

31
00:01:14,972 --> 00:01:18,172
 of the Lord, and that shall say the Lord no

32
00:01:18,172 --> 00:01:21,372
 longer worketh by revelation, or by prophecy, or by

33
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:24,572
 gifts, or by tongues, or by healings, or by the power

34
00:01:24,572 --> 00:01:27,772
 of the Holy Ghost

35
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:30,921
7 Yea, and wo unto him that shall say at that day,

36
00:01:30,921 --> 00:01:34,121
 to get gain, that there can be no miracle wrought

37
00:01:34,121 --> 00:01:37,321
 by Jesus Christ; for he that doeth this shall

38
00:01:37,321 --> 00:01:40,521
 become like unto the son of perdition, for whom there

39
00:01:40,521 --> 00:01:43,721
 was no mercy, according to the word of Christ

40
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:46,87
8 Yea, and ye need not any longer hiss, nor spurn,

41
00:01:46,87 --> 00:01:50,07
 nor make game of the Jews, nor any of the remnant

42
00:01:50,07 --> 00:01:53,27
 of the house of Israel; for behold, the Lord

43
00:01:53,27 --> 00:01:56,47
 remembereth his covenant unto them, and he will do

44
00:01:56,47 --> 00:01:59,67
 unto them according to that which he hath sworn

45
00:01:59,62 --> 00:01:59,82
9 Therefore ye need not suppose that ye can turn

46
00:01:59,82 --> 00:02:00,02
 the right hand of the Lord unto the left, that he

47
00:02:00,02 --> 00:02:00,219
 may not execute judgment unto the fulfilling of the

48
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:00,419
 covenant which he hath made unto the house of

49
00:02:00,419 --> 00:02:00,62
 Israel.
