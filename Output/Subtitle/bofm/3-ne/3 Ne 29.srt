00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:05,8
Chapter 29 The coming forth of the Book of

2
00:00:05,8 --> 00:00:11,6
Mormon is a sign that the Lord has

3
00:00:11,6 --> 00:00:17,4
commenced to gather Israel and fulfill His

4
00:00:17,4 --> 00:00:23,2
covenants—Those who reject His latter-day

5
00:00:23,2 --> 00:00:29,763
revelations and gifts will be cursed. About A.D. 34–35. 

6
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:29,652
1 And now behold, I say unto you that

7
00:00:29,652 --> 00:00:29,541
when the Lord shall see fit, in his

8
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:29,43
wisdom, that these sayings shall come

9
00:00:29,43 --> 00:00:29,319
unto the Gentiles according to his word,

10
00:00:29,319 --> 00:00:29,208
then ye may know that the covenant

11
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:29,097
which the Father hath made with the

12
00:00:29,097 --> 00:00:28,986
children of Israel, concerning their

13
00:00:28,986 --> 00:00:28,875
restoration to the lands of their

14
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:28,829
inheritance, is already beginning to be fulfilled.

15
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:29,662
2 And ye may know that the words

16
00:00:29,662 --> 00:00:30,495
of the Lord, which have been

17
00:00:30,495 --> 00:00:31,328
spoken by the holy prophets, shall

18
00:00:31,328 --> 00:00:32,161
all be fulfilled; and ye need

19
00:00:32,161 --> 00:00:32,994
not say that the Lord delays his

20
00:00:32,994 --> 00:00:33,233
coming unto the children of Israel.

21
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:33,804
3 And ye need not imagine

22
00:00:33,804 --> 00:00:34,375
in your hearts that the

23
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:34,946
words which have been spoken

24
00:00:34,946 --> 00:00:35,517
are vain, for behold, the

25
00:00:35,517 --> 00:00:36,088
Lord will remember his

26
00:00:36,088 --> 00:00:36,659
covenant which he hath made unto

27
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:37,638
his people of the house of Israel.

28
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:37,547
4 And when ye shall see

29
00:00:37,547 --> 00:00:37,456
these sayings coming forth

30
00:00:37,456 --> 00:00:37,365
among you, then ye need

31
00:00:37,365 --> 00:00:37,274
not any longer spurn at

32
00:00:37,274 --> 00:00:37,183
the doings of the Lord,

33
00:00:37,183 --> 00:00:37,092
for the sword of his

34
00:00:37,092 --> 00:00:37,001
justice is in his right hand;

35
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:36,91
and behold, at that day,

36
00:00:36,91 --> 00:00:36,819
if ye shall spurn at his

37
00:00:36,819 --> 00:00:36,728
doings he will cause that

38
00:00:36,728 --> 00:00:36,703
it shall soon overtake you.

39
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:36,503
5 Wo unto him that

40
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:36,303
spurneth at the doings of

41
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:36,103
the Lord; yea, wo

42
00:00:36,103 --> 00:00:35,903
unto him that shall deny

43
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:35,769
the Christ and his works!

44
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:35,669
6 Yea, wo unto him

45
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:35,569
that shall deny the

46
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:35,469
revelations of the Lord,

47
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,369
and that shall say

48
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:35,269
the Lord no longer

49
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:35,169
worketh by revelation,

50
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:35,069
or by prophecy, or by

51
00:00:35,069 --> 00:00:34,969
gifts, or by tongues,

52
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:34,869
or by healings, or

53
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:34,835
by the power of the Holy Ghost!

54
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:34,918
7 Yea, and wo unto

55
00:00:34,918 --> 00:00:35,001
him that shall say at

56
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:35,084
that day, to get

57
00:00:35,084 --> 00:00:35,167
gain, that there can

58
00:00:35,167 --> 00:00:35,25
be no miracle wrought

59
00:00:35,25 --> 00:00:35,333
by Jesus Christ;

60
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:35,416
for he that doeth this

61
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:35,499
shall become like

62
00:00:35,499 --> 00:00:35,582
unto the son of

63
00:00:35,582 --> 00:00:35,665
perdition, for whom there

64
00:00:35,665 --> 00:00:35,748
was no mercy,

65
00:00:35,748 --> 00:00:35,836
according to the word of Christ!

66
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:35,759
8 Yea, and ye need

67
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:35,682
not any longer

68
00:00:35,682 --> 00:00:35,605
hiss, nor spurn, nor

69
00:00:35,605 --> 00:00:35,528
make game of the

70
00:00:35,528 --> 00:00:35,451
Jews, nor any of

71
00:00:35,451 --> 00:00:35,374
the remnant of the

72
00:00:35,374 --> 00:00:35,297
house of Israel;

73
00:00:35,297 --> 00:00:35,22
for behold, the

74
00:00:35,22 --> 00:00:35,143
Lord remembereth his

75
00:00:35,143 --> 00:00:35,066
covenant unto

76
00:00:35,066 --> 00:00:34,989
them, and he will do

77
00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:34,912
unto them according

78
00:00:34,912 --> 00:00:34,902
to that which he hath sworn.

79
00:00:34,902 --> 00:00:34,985
9 Therefore ye

80
00:00:34,985 --> 00:00:35,068
need not suppose

81
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:35,151
that ye can turn

82
00:00:35,151 --> 00:00:35,234
the right hand of

83
00:00:35,234 --> 00:00:35,317
the Lord unto the

84
00:00:35,317 --> 00:00:35,4
left, that he may

85
00:00:35,4 --> 00:00:35,483
not execute

86
00:00:35,483 --> 00:00:35,566
judgment unto the

87
00:00:35,566 --> 00:00:35,649
fulfilling of the

88
00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:35,732
covenant which he

89
00:00:35,732 --> 00:00:35,815
hath made unto the

90
00:00:35,815 --> 00:00:35,903
house of Israel.
