00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 29 The coming forth of the Book of

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Mormon is a sign that the Lord has

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
commenced to gather Israel and fulfill His

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
covenants—Those who reject His latter-day

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:06:11,
revelations and gifts will be cursed. About A.D. 34–35. 

6
00:06:11,0 --> 00:06:11,0
1 And now behold, I say unto you that

7
00:06:11,0 --> 00:06:11,0
when the Lord shall see fit, in his

8
00:06:11,0 --> 00:06:11,0
wisdom, that these sayings shall come

9
00:06:11,0 --> 00:06:11,0
unto the Gentiles according to his word,

10
00:06:11,0 --> 00:06:11,0
then ye may know that the covenant

11
00:06:11,0 --> 00:06:11,0
which the Father hath made with the

12
00:06:11,0 --> 00:06:11,0
children of Israel, concerning their

13
00:06:11,0 --> 00:06:11,0
restoration to the lands of their

14
00:06:11,0 --> 00:07:23,
inheritance, is already beginning to be fulfilled.

15
00:07:23,0 --> 00:07:23,0
2 And ye may know that the words

16
00:07:23,0 --> 00:07:23,0
of the Lord, which have been

17
00:07:23,0 --> 00:07:23,0
spoken by the holy prophets, shall

18
00:07:23,0 --> 00:07:23,0
all be fulfilled; and ye need

19
00:07:23,0 --> 00:07:23,0
not say that the Lord delays his

20
00:07:23,0 --> 00:12:34,
coming unto the children of Israel.

21
00:12:34,0 --> 00:12:34,0
3 And ye need not imagine

22
00:12:34,0 --> 00:12:34,0
in your hearts that the

23
00:12:34,0 --> 00:12:34,0
words which have been spoken

24
00:12:34,0 --> 00:12:34,0
are vain, for behold, the

25
00:12:34,0 --> 00:12:34,0
Lord will remember his

26
00:12:34,0 --> 00:12:34,0
covenant which he hath made unto

27
00:12:34,0 --> 00:16:47,
his people of the house of Israel.

28
00:16:47,0 --> 00:16:47,0
4 And when ye shall see

29
00:16:47,0 --> 00:16:47,0
these sayings coming forth

30
00:16:47,0 --> 00:16:47,0
among you, then ye need

31
00:16:47,0 --> 00:16:47,0
not any longer spurn at

32
00:16:47,0 --> 00:16:47,0
the doings of the Lord,

33
00:16:47,0 --> 00:16:47,0
for the sword of his

34
00:16:47,0 --> 00:16:47,0
justice is in his right hand;

35
00:16:47,0 --> 00:16:47,0
and behold, at that day,

36
00:16:47,0 --> 00:16:47,0
if ye shall spurn at his

37
00:16:47,0 --> 00:16:47,0
doings he will cause that

38
00:16:47,0 --> 00:16:19,
it shall soon overtake you.

39
00:16:19,0 --> 00:16:19,0
5 Wo unto him that

40
00:16:19,0 --> 00:16:19,0
spurneth at the doings of

41
00:16:19,0 --> 00:16:19,0
the Lord; yea, wo

42
00:16:19,0 --> 00:16:19,0
unto him that shall deny

43
00:16:19,0 --> 00:17:31,
the Christ and his works!

44
00:17:31,0 --> 00:17:31,0
6 Yea, wo unto him

45
00:17:31,0 --> 00:17:31,0
that shall deny the

46
00:17:31,0 --> 00:17:31,0
revelations of the Lord,

47
00:17:31,0 --> 00:17:31,0
and that shall say

48
00:17:31,0 --> 00:17:31,0
the Lord no longer

49
00:17:31,0 --> 00:17:31,0
worketh by revelation,

50
00:17:31,0 --> 00:17:31,0
or by prophecy, or by

51
00:17:31,0 --> 00:17:31,0
gifts, or by tongues,

52
00:17:31,0 --> 00:17:31,0
or by healings, or

53
00:17:31,0 --> 00:17:17,
by the power of the Holy Ghost!

54
00:17:17,0 --> 00:17:17,0
7 Yea, and wo unto

55
00:17:17,0 --> 00:17:17,0
him that shall say at

56
00:17:17,0 --> 00:17:17,0
that day, to get

57
00:17:17,0 --> 00:17:17,0
gain, that there can

58
00:17:17,0 --> 00:17:17,0
be no miracle wrought

59
00:17:17,0 --> 00:17:17,0
by Jesus Christ;

60
00:17:17,0 --> 00:17:17,0
for he that doeth this

61
00:17:17,0 --> 00:17:17,0
shall become like

62
00:17:17,0 --> 00:17:17,0
unto the son of

63
00:17:17,0 --> 00:17:17,0
perdition, for whom there

64
00:17:17,0 --> 00:17:17,0
was no mercy,

65
00:17:17,0 --> 00:18:29,
according to the word of Christ!

66
00:18:29,0 --> 00:18:29,0
8 Yea, and ye need

67
00:18:29,0 --> 00:18:29,0
not any longer

68
00:18:29,0 --> 00:18:29,0
hiss, nor spurn, nor

69
00:18:29,0 --> 00:18:29,0
make game of the

70
00:18:29,0 --> 00:18:29,0
Jews, nor any of

71
00:18:29,0 --> 00:18:29,0
the remnant of the

72
00:18:29,0 --> 00:18:29,0
house of Israel;

73
00:18:29,0 --> 00:18:29,0
for behold, the

74
00:18:29,0 --> 00:18:29,0
Lord remembereth his

75
00:18:29,0 --> 00:18:29,0
covenant unto

76
00:18:29,0 --> 00:18:29,0
them, and he will do

77
00:18:29,0 --> 00:18:29,0
unto them according

78
00:18:29,0 --> 00:18:01,
to that which he hath sworn.

79
00:18:01,0 --> 00:18:01,0
9 Therefore ye

80
00:18:01,0 --> 00:18:01,0
need not suppose

81
00:18:01,0 --> 00:18:01,0
that ye can turn

82
00:18:01,0 --> 00:18:01,0
the right hand of

83
00:18:01,0 --> 00:18:01,0
the Lord unto the

84
00:18:01,0 --> 00:18:01,0
left, that he may

85
00:18:01,0 --> 00:18:01,0
not execute

86
00:18:01,0 --> 00:18:01,0
judgment unto the

87
00:18:01,0 --> 00:18:01,0
fulfilling of the

88
00:18:01,0 --> 00:18:01,0
covenant which he

89
00:18:01,0 --> 00:18:01,0
hath made unto the

90
00:18:01,0 --> 00:20:13,
house of Israel.
