00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,4
Chapter 26 Jesus expounds all things from the

2
00:00:01,4 --> 00:00:02,8
 beginning to the end—Babes and children utter

3
00:00:02,8 --> 00:00:04,2
 marvelous things that cannot be written—Those in the

4
00:00:04,2 --> 00:00:05,6
 Church of Christ have all things in common among them.

5
00:00:05,6 --> 00:00:07,0
 About A.D. 34.

6
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,975
1 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had told

7
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:11,975
 these things he expounded them unto the

8
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:13,975
 multitude; and he did expound all things unto them, both

9
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:15,975
 great and small

10
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,949
2 And he saith: These scriptures, which ye had not

11
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:19,949
 with you, the Father commanded that I should give

12
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:21,949
 unto you; for it was wisdom in him that they

13
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:23,949
 should be given unto future generations

14
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,067
3 And he did expound all things, even from the

15
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:26,21
 beginning until the time that he should come in his

16
00:00:26,21 --> 00:00:27,353
 glory—yea, even all things which should come upon

17
00:00:27,353 --> 00:00:28,496
 the face of the earth, even until the elements

18
00:00:28,496 --> 00:00:29,639
 should melt with fervent heat, and the earth should be

19
00:00:29,639 --> 00:00:30,782
 wrapt together as a scroll, and the heavens and

20
00:00:30,782 --> 00:00:31,925
 the earth should pass away

21
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,499
4 And even unto the great and last day, when all

22
00:00:33,499 --> 00:00:35,099
 people, and all kindreds, and all nations and

23
00:00:35,099 --> 00:00:36,699
 tongues shall stand before God, to be judged of their

24
00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:38,299
 works, whether they be good or whether they be

25
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:39,899
 evil

26
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,016
5 If they be good, to the resurrection of

27
00:00:41,016 --> 00:00:42,159
 everlasting life; and if they be evil, to the resurrection

28
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:43,302
 of damnation; being on a parallel, the one on the

29
00:00:43,302 --> 00:00:44,445
 one hand and the other on the other hand,

30
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:45,588
 according to the mercy, and the justice, and the holiness

31
00:00:45,588 --> 00:00:46,731
 which is in Christ, who was before the world

32
00:00:46,731 --> 00:00:47,874
 began

33
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:50,515
6 And now there cannot be written in this book

34
00:00:50,515 --> 00:00:53,182
 even a hundredth part of the things which Jesus did

35
00:00:53,182 --> 00:00:55,849
 truly teach unto the people

36
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:59,822
7 But behold the plates of Nephi do contain the

37
00:00:59,822 --> 00:01:03,822
 more part of the things which he taught the people

38
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,13
8 And these things have I written, which are a

39
00:01:05,13 --> 00:01:06,463
 lesser part of the things which he taught the people;

40
00:01:06,463 --> 00:01:07,796
 and I have written them to the intent that they

41
00:01:07,796 --> 00:01:09,129
 may be brought again unto this people, from the

42
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:10,462
 Gentiles, according to the words which Jesus hath

43
00:01:10,462 --> 00:01:11,795
 spoken

44
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:13,372
9 And when they shall have received this, which is

45
00:01:13,372 --> 00:01:14,972
 expedient that they should have first, to try

46
00:01:14,972 --> 00:01:16,572
 their faith, and if it shall so be that they shall

47
00:01:16,572 --> 00:01:18,172
 believe these things then shall the greater things

48
00:01:18,172 --> 00:01:19,772
 be made manifest unto them

49
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:30,413
10 And if it so be that they will not believe

50
00:01:30,413 --> 00:01:41,08
 these things, then shall the greater things be

51
00:01:41,08 --> 00:01:51,747
 withheld from them, unto their condemnation

52
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:53,645
11 Behold, I was about to write them, all which

53
00:01:53,645 --> 00:01:55,645
 were engraven upon the plates of Nephi, but the Lord

54
00:01:55,645 --> 00:01:57,645
 forbade it, saying: I will try the faith of my

55
00:01:57,645 --> 00:01:59,645
 people

56
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:03,62
12 Therefore I, Mormon, do write the things which

57
00:02:03,62 --> 00:02:07,62
 have been commanded me of the Lord. And now I,

58
00:02:07,62 --> 00:02:11,62
 Mormon, make an end of my sayings, and proceed to

59
00:02:11,62 --> 00:02:15,62
 write the things which have been commanded me

60
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:17,169
13 Therefore, I would that ye should behold that

61
00:02:17,169 --> 00:02:18,769
 the Lord truly did teach the people, for the space

62
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:20,369
 of three days; and after that he did show himself

63
00:02:20,369 --> 00:02:21,969
 unto them oft, and did break bread oft, and bless

64
00:02:21,969 --> 00:02:23,569
 it, and give it unto them

65
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:24,686
14 And it came to pass that he did teach and

66
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:25,829
 minister unto the children of the multitude of whom

67
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:26,972
 hath been spoken, and he did loose their tongues, and

68
00:02:26,972 --> 00:02:28,115
 they did speak unto their fathers great and

69
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:29,258
 marvelous things, even greater than he had revealed

70
00:02:29,258 --> 00:02:30,401
 unto the people; and he loosed their tongues that

71
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:31,544
 they could utter

72
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:32,407
15 And it came to pass that after he had ascended

73
00:02:32,407 --> 00:02:33,296
 into heaven—the second time that he showed himself

74
00:02:33,296 --> 00:02:34,185
 unto them, and had gone unto the Father, after

75
00:02:34,185 --> 00:02:35,074
 having healed all their sick, and their lame, and

76
00:02:35,074 --> 00:02:35,963
 opened the eyes of their blind and unstopped the

77
00:02:35,963 --> 00:02:36,852
 ears of the deaf, and even had done all manner of

78
00:02:36,852 --> 00:02:37,741
 cures among them, and raised a man from the dead, and

79
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:38,63
 had shown forth his power unto them, and had

80
00:02:38,63 --> 00:02:39,519
 ascended unto the Father

81
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:44,826
16 Behold, it came to pass on the morrow that the

82
00:02:44,826 --> 00:02:50,159
 multitude gathered themselves together, and they

83
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:55,492
 both saw and heard these children; yea, even babes

84
00:02:55,492 --> 00:03:00,825
 did open their mouths and utter marvelous things;

85
00:03:00,825 --> 00:03:06,158
 and the things which they did utter were forbidden

86
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:11,491
 that there should not any man write them

87
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:12,991
17 And it came to pass that the disciples whom

88
00:03:12,991 --> 00:03:14,591
 Jesus had chosen began from that time forth to

89
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:16,191
 baptize and to teach as many as did come unto them; and

90
00:03:16,191 --> 00:03:17,791
 as many as were baptized in the name of Jesus were

91
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,391
 filled with the Holy Ghost

92
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:23,366
18 And many of them saw and heard unspeakable

93
00:03:23,366 --> 00:03:27,366
 things, which are not lawful to be written

94
00:03:27,34 --> 00:03:30,007
19 And they taught, and did minister one to

95
00:03:30,007 --> 00:03:32,674
 another; and they had all things common among them,

96
00:03:32,674 --> 00:03:35,341
 every man dealing justly, one with another

97
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:43,315
20 And it came to pass that they did do all things

98
00:03:43,315 --> 00:03:51,315
 even as Jesus had commanded them

99
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,264
21 And they who were baptized in the name of Jesus

100
00:03:53,264 --> 00:03:55,264
 were called the church of Christ.
