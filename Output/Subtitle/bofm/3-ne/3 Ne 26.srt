1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 26 Jesus expounds all things from

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the beginning to the end—Babes and children

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
utter marvelous things that cannot be

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
written—Those in the Church of Christ have all

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:19:41,
things in common among them. About A.D. 34. 

6
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:41,0
1 And now it came to pass that when Jesus

7
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:41,0
had told these things he expounded them

8
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:41,0
unto the multitude; and he did expound

9
00:19:41,0 --> 00:20:53,
all things unto them, both great and small.

10
00:20:53,0 --> 00:20:53,0
2 And he saith: These scriptures,

11
00:20:53,0 --> 00:20:53,0
which ye had not with you, the Father

12
00:20:53,0 --> 00:20:53,0
commanded that I should give unto you;

13
00:20:53,0 --> 00:20:53,0
for it was wisdom in him that they

14
00:20:53,0 --> 00:31:47,
should be given unto future generations.

15
00:31:47,0 --> 00:31:47,0
3 And he did expound all things,

16
00:31:47,0 --> 00:31:47,0
even from the beginning until the time

17
00:31:47,0 --> 00:31:47,0
that he should come in his

18
00:31:47,0 --> 00:31:47,0
glory—yea, even all things which should come

19
00:31:47,0 --> 00:31:47,0
upon the face of the earth, even

20
00:31:47,0 --> 00:31:47,0
until the elements should melt with

21
00:31:47,0 --> 00:31:47,0
fervent heat, and the earth should be

22
00:31:47,0 --> 00:31:47,0
wrapt together as a scroll, and the

23
00:31:47,0 --> 00:41:29,
heavens and the earth should pass away;

24
00:41:29,0 --> 00:41:29,0
4 And even unto the great and

25
00:41:29,0 --> 00:41:29,0
last day, when all people, and all

26
00:41:29,0 --> 00:41:29,0
kindreds, and all nations and

27
00:41:29,0 --> 00:41:29,0
tongues shall stand before God, to be

28
00:41:29,0 --> 00:41:29,0
judged of their works, whether

29
00:41:29,0 --> 00:48:37,
they be good or whether they be evil—

30
00:48:37,0 --> 00:48:37,0
5 If they be good, to the

31
00:48:37,0 --> 00:48:37,0
resurrection of everlasting life;

32
00:48:37,0 --> 00:48:37,0
and if they be evil, to the

33
00:48:37,0 --> 00:48:37,0
resurrection of damnation; being

34
00:48:37,0 --> 00:48:37,0
on a parallel, the one on the

35
00:48:37,0 --> 00:48:37,0
one hand and the other on the

36
00:48:37,0 --> 00:48:37,0
other hand, according to the

37
00:48:37,0 --> 00:48:37,0
mercy, and the justice, and

38
00:48:37,0 --> 00:48:37,0
the holiness which is in Christ,

39
00:48:37,0 --> 01:04:05,
who was before the world began.

40
01:04:05,0 --> 01:04:05,0
6 And now there cannot be

41
01:04:05,0 --> 01:04:05,0
written in this book

42
01:04:05,0 --> 01:04:05,0
even a hundredth part of the

43
01:04:05,0 --> 01:04:05,0
things which Jesus did

44
01:04:05,0 --> 01:03:51,
truly teach unto the people;

45
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
7 But behold the plates

46
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
of Nephi do contain the

47
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
more part of the things

48
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,
which he taught the people.

49
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
8 And these things have

50
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
I written, which are a

51
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
lesser part of the

52
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
things which he taught the

53
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
people; and I have

54
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
written them to the intent

55
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
that they may be

56
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
brought again unto this

57
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
people, from the Gentiles,

58
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
according to the words

59
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,
which Jesus hath spoken.

60
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
9 And when they shall

61
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
have received this,

62
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
which is expedient that

63
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
they should have

64
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
first, to try their faith,

65
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
and if it shall so be

66
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
that they shall

67
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
believe these things then

68
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
shall the greater things

69
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,
be made manifest unto them.

70
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
10 And if it so be

71
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
that they will not

72
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
believe these

73
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
things, then shall the

74
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
greater things be

75
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
withheld from them,

76
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,
unto their condemnation.

77
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
11 Behold, I was

78
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
about to write

79
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
them, all which

80
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
were engraven upon

81
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
the plates of

82
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
Nephi, but the Lord

83
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
forbade it,

84
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
saying: I will try the

85
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,
faith of my people.

86
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
12 Therefore I,

87
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
Mormon, do write

88
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
the things

89
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
which have been

90
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
commanded me of the

91
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
Lord. And now I,

92
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
Mormon, make an

93
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
end of my

94
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
sayings, and proceed

95
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
to write the

96
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
things which have

97
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,
been commanded me.

98
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
13 Therefore, I

99
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
would that ye

100
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
should behold

101
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
that the Lord

102
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
truly did teach

103
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
the people, for

104
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
the space of

105
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
three days; and

106
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
after that he

107
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
did show himself

108
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
unto them oft,

109
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
and did break

110
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
bread oft, and

111
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
bless it, and

112
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,
give it unto them.

113
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
14 And it came

114
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
to pass that

115
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
he did teach

116
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
and minister

117
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
unto the

118
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
children of the

119
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
multitude of whom

120
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
hath been

121
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
spoken, and he did

122
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
loose their

123
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
tongues, and

124
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
they did speak

125
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
unto their

126
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
fathers great and

127
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
marvelous

128
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
things, even

129
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
greater than he had

130
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
revealed unto

131
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
the people;

132
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
and he loosed

133
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,
their tongues that they could utter.

134
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
15 And it

135
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
came to pass

136
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
that after he

137
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
had ascended

138
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
into heaven—the

139
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
second time

140
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
that he

141
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
showed himself

142
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
unto them, and

143
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
had gone unto

144
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
the Father,

145
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
after having

146
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
healed all

147
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
their sick, and

148
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
their lame,

149
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
and opened the

150
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
eyes of

151
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
their blind and

152
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
unstopped the

153
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
ears of the

154
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
deaf, and even

155
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
had done all

156
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
manner of

157
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
cures among

158
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
them, and raised

159
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
a man from

160
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
the dead, and

161
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
had shown

162
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
forth his power

163
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
unto them,

164
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,
and had ascended unto the Father—

165
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
16 Behold,

166
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
it came to

167
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
pass on the

168
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
morrow that

169
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
the multitude

170
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
gathered

171
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
themselves

172
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
together, and

173
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
they both saw

174
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
and heard

175
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
these

176
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
children; yea, even

177
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
babes did

178
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
open their

179
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
mouths and

180
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
utter marvelous

181
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
things; and

182
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
the things

183
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
which they

184
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
did utter were

185
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
forbidden

186
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
that there

187
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,
should not any man write them.

188
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
17 And it

189
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
came to pass

190
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
that the

191
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
disciples whom

192
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
Jesus had

193
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
chosen began

194
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
from that time

195
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
forth to

196
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
baptize and to

197
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
teach as

198
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
many as did

199
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
come unto

200
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
them; and as

201
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
many as were

202
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
baptized in

203
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
the name of

204
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
Jesus were

205
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
filled with the

206
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,
Holy Ghost.

207
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
18 And many

208
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
of them

209
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
saw and heard

210
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0


211
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
unspeakable things,

212
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
which are

213
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
not lawful to

214
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,
be written.

215
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
19 And

216
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
they taught,

217
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
and did

218
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
minister one

219
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
to

220
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
another; and

221
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
they had all

222
01:03:51,0 --> 01:03:51,0
things

223
