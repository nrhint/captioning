1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,4
Chapter 26 Jesus expounds all things from

2
00:00:01,4 --> 00:00:02,8
the beginning to the end—Babes and children

3
00:00:02,8 --> 00:00:04,2
utter marvelous things that cannot be

4
00:00:04,2 --> 00:00:05,6
written—Those in the Church of Christ have all

5
00:00:05,6 --> 00:00:07,04
things in common among them. About A.D. 34. 

6
00:00:07,04 --> 00:00:14,29
1 And now it came to pass that when Jesus

7
00:00:14,29 --> 00:00:21,54
had told these things he expounded them

8
00:00:21,54 --> 00:00:28,79
unto the multitude; and he did expound

9
00:00:28,79 --> 00:00:36,837
all things unto them, both great and small.

10
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:38,037
2 And he saith: These scriptures,

11
00:00:38,037 --> 00:00:39,237
which ye had not with you, the Father

12
00:00:39,237 --> 00:00:40,437
commanded that I should give unto you;

13
00:00:40,437 --> 00:00:41,637
for it was wisdom in him that they

14
00:00:41,637 --> 00:00:42,242
should be given unto future generations.

15
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:44,575
3 And he did expound all things,

16
00:00:44,575 --> 00:00:46,908
even from the beginning until the time

17
00:00:46,908 --> 00:00:49,241
that he should come in his

18
00:00:49,241 --> 00:00:51,574
glory—yea, even all things which should come

19
00:00:51,574 --> 00:00:53,907
upon the face of the earth, even

20
00:00:53,907 --> 00:00:56,24
until the elements should melt with

21
00:00:56,24 --> 00:00:58,573
fervent heat, and the earth should be

22
00:00:58,573 --> 00:01:00,906
wrapt together as a scroll, and the

23
00:01:00,906 --> 00:01:03,563
heavens and the earth should pass away;

24
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:07,064
4 And even unto the great and

25
00:01:07,064 --> 00:01:10,564
last day, when all people, and all

26
00:01:10,564 --> 00:01:14,064
kindreds, and all nations and

27
00:01:14,064 --> 00:01:17,564
tongues shall stand before God, to be

28
00:01:17,564 --> 00:01:21,064
judged of their works, whether

29
00:01:21,064 --> 00:01:24,918
they be good or whether they be evil—

30
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,218
5 If they be good, to the

31
00:01:26,218 --> 00:01:27,518
resurrection of everlasting life;

32
00:01:27,518 --> 00:01:28,818
and if they be evil, to the

33
00:01:28,818 --> 00:01:30,118
resurrection of damnation; being

34
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:31,418
on a parallel, the one on the

35
00:01:31,418 --> 00:01:32,718
one hand and the other on the

36
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:34,018
other hand, according to the

37
00:01:34,018 --> 00:01:35,318
mercy, and the justice, and

38
00:01:35,318 --> 00:01:36,618
the holiness which is in Christ,

39
00:01:36,618 --> 00:01:37,264
who was before the world began.

40
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:40,064
6 And now there cannot be

41
00:01:40,064 --> 00:01:42,864
written in this book

42
00:01:42,864 --> 00:01:45,664
even a hundredth part of the

43
00:01:45,664 --> 00:01:48,464
things which Jesus did

44
00:01:48,464 --> 00:01:51,545
truly teach unto the people;

45
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:56,545
7 But behold the plates

46
00:01:56,545 --> 00:02:01,545
of Nephi do contain the

47
00:02:01,545 --> 00:02:06,545
more part of the things

48
00:02:06,545 --> 00:02:11,898
which he taught the people.

49
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:14,898
8 And these things have

50
00:02:14,898 --> 00:02:17,898
I written, which are a

51
00:02:17,898 --> 00:02:20,898
lesser part of the

52
00:02:20,898 --> 00:02:23,898
things which he taught the

53
00:02:23,898 --> 00:02:26,898
people; and I have

54
00:02:26,898 --> 00:02:29,898
written them to the intent

55
00:02:29,898 --> 00:02:32,898
that they may be

56
00:02:32,898 --> 00:02:35,898
brought again unto this

57
00:02:35,898 --> 00:02:38,898
people, from the Gentiles,

58
00:02:38,898 --> 00:02:41,898
according to the words

59
00:02:41,898 --> 00:02:44,264
which Jesus hath spoken.

60
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:47,664
9 And when they shall

61
00:02:47,664 --> 00:02:51,064
have received this,

62
00:02:51,064 --> 00:02:54,464
which is expedient that

63
00:02:54,464 --> 00:02:57,864
they should have

64
00:02:57,864 --> 00:03:01,264
first, to try their faith,

65
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:04,664
and if it shall so be

66
00:03:04,664 --> 00:03:08,064
that they shall

67
00:03:08,064 --> 00:03:11,464
believe these things then

68
00:03:11,464 --> 00:03:14,864
shall the greater things

69
00:03:14,864 --> 00:03:18,565
be made manifest unto them.

70
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:18,565
10 And if it so be

71
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:18,565
that they will not

72
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:18,565
believe these

73
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:18,565
things, then shall the

74
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:18,565
greater things be

75
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:18,565
withheld from them,

76
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:18,098
unto their condemnation.

77
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:17,987
11 Behold, I was

78
00:03:17,987 --> 00:03:17,876
about to write

79
00:03:17,876 --> 00:03:17,765
them, all which

80
00:03:17,765 --> 00:03:17,654
were engraven upon

81
00:03:17,654 --> 00:03:17,543
the plates of

82
00:03:17,543 --> 00:03:17,432
Nephi, but the Lord

83
00:03:17,432 --> 00:03:17,321
forbade it,

84
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:17,21
saying: I will try the

85
00:03:17,21 --> 00:03:17,631
faith of my people.

86
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:17,714
12 Therefore I,

87
00:03:17,714 --> 00:03:17,797
Mormon, do write

88
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:17,88
the things

89
00:03:17,88 --> 00:03:17,963
which have been

90
00:03:17,963 --> 00:03:18,046
commanded me of the

91
00:03:18,046 --> 00:03:18,129
Lord. And now I,

92
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:18,212
Mormon, make an

93
00:03:18,212 --> 00:03:18,295
end of my

94
00:03:18,295 --> 00:03:18,378
sayings, and proceed

95
00:03:18,378 --> 00:03:18,461
to write the

96
00:03:18,461 --> 00:03:18,544
things which have

97
00:03:18,544 --> 00:03:18,098
been commanded me.

98
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:18,031
13 Therefore, I

99
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:17,964
would that ye

100
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:17,897
should behold

101
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:17,83
that the Lord

102
00:03:17,83 --> 00:03:17,763
truly did teach

103
00:03:17,763 --> 00:03:17,696
the people, for

104
00:03:17,696 --> 00:03:17,629
the space of

105
00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:17,562
three days; and

106
00:03:17,562 --> 00:03:17,495
after that he

107
00:03:17,495 --> 00:03:17,428
did show himself

108
00:03:17,428 --> 00:03:17,361
unto them oft,

109
00:03:17,361 --> 00:03:17,294
and did break

110
00:03:17,294 --> 00:03:17,227
bread oft, and

111
00:03:17,227 --> 00:03:17,16
bless it, and

112
00:03:17,16 --> 00:03:17,631
give it unto them.

113
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:17,679
14 And it came

114
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:17,727
to pass that

115
00:03:17,727 --> 00:03:17,775
he did teach

116
00:03:17,775 --> 00:03:17,823
and minister

117
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:17,871
unto the

118
00:03:17,871 --> 00:03:17,919
children of the

119
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:17,967
multitude of whom

120
00:03:17,967 --> 00:03:18,015
hath been

121
00:03:18,015 --> 00:03:18,063
spoken, and he did

122
00:03:18,063 --> 00:03:18,111
loose their

123
00:03:18,111 --> 00:03:18,159
tongues, and

124
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:18,207
they did speak

125
00:03:18,207 --> 00:03:18,255
unto their

126
00:03:18,255 --> 00:03:18,303
fathers great and

127
00:03:18,303 --> 00:03:18,351
marvelous

128
00:03:18,351 --> 00:03:18,399
things, even

129
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:18,447
greater than he had

130
00:03:18,447 --> 00:03:18,495
revealed unto

131
00:03:18,495 --> 00:03:18,543
the people;

132
00:03:18,543 --> 00:03:18,591
and he loosed

133
00:03:18,591 --> 00:03:18,098
their tongues that they could utter.

134
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:18,066
15 And it

135
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:18,034
came to pass

136
00:03:18,034 --> 00:03:18,002
that after he

137
00:03:18,002 --> 00:03:17,97
had ascended

138
00:03:17,97 --> 00:03:17,938
into heaven—the

139
00:03:17,938 --> 00:03:17,906
second time

140
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:17,874
that he

141
00:03:17,874 --> 00:03:17,842
showed himself

142
00:03:17,842 --> 00:03:17,81
unto them, and

143
00:03:17,81 --> 00:03:17,778
had gone unto

144
00:03:17,778 --> 00:03:17,746
the Father,

145
00:03:17,746 --> 00:03:17,714
after having

146
00:03:17,714 --> 00:03:17,682
healed all

147
00:03:17,682 --> 00:03:17,65
their sick, and

148
00:03:17,65 --> 00:03:17,618
their lame,

149
00:03:17,618 --> 00:03:17,586
and opened the

150
00:03:17,586 --> 00:03:17,554
eyes of

151
00:03:17,554 --> 00:03:17,522
their blind and

152
00:03:17,522 --> 00:03:17,49
unstopped the

153
00:03:17,49 --> 00:03:17,458
ears of the

154
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:17,426
deaf, and even

155
00:03:17,426 --> 00:03:17,394
had done all

156
00:03:17,394 --> 00:03:17,362
manner of

157
00:03:17,362 --> 00:03:17,33
cures among

158
00:03:17,33 --> 00:03:17,298
them, and raised

159
00:03:17,298 --> 00:03:17,266
a man from

160
00:03:17,266 --> 00:03:17,234
the dead, and

161
00:03:17,234 --> 00:03:17,202
had shown

162
00:03:17,202 --> 00:03:17,17
forth his power

163
00:03:17,17 --> 00:03:17,138
unto them,

164
00:03:17,138 --> 00:03:17,631
and had ascended unto the Father—

165
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:17,674
16 Behold,

166
00:03:17,674 --> 00:03:17,717
it came to

167
00:03:17,717 --> 00:03:17,76
pass on the

168
00:03:17,76 --> 00:03:17,803
morrow that

169
00:03:17,803 --> 00:03:17,846
the multitude

170
00:03:17,846 --> 00:03:17,889
gathered

171
00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:17,932
themselves

172
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:17,975
together, and

173
00:03:17,975 --> 00:03:18,018
they both saw

174
00:03:18,018 --> 00:03:18,061
and heard

175
00:03:18,061 --> 00:03:18,104
these

176
00:03:18,104 --> 00:03:18,147
children; yea, even

177
00:03:18,147 --> 00:03:18,19
babes did

178
00:03:18,19 --> 00:03:18,233
open their

179
00:03:18,233 --> 00:03:18,276
mouths and

180
00:03:18,276 --> 00:03:18,319
utter marvelous

181
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:18,362
things; and

182
00:03:18,362 --> 00:03:18,405
the things

183
00:03:18,405 --> 00:03:18,448
which they

184
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:18,491
did utter were

185
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:18,534
forbidden

186
00:03:18,534 --> 00:03:18,577
that there

187
00:03:18,577 --> 00:03:18,098
should not any man write them.

188
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:18,045
17 And it

189
00:03:18,045 --> 00:03:17,992
came to pass

190
00:03:17,992 --> 00:03:17,939
that the

191
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:17,886
disciples whom

192
00:03:17,886 --> 00:03:17,833
Jesus had

193
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:17,78
chosen began

194
00:03:17,78 --> 00:03:17,727
from that time

195
00:03:17,727 --> 00:03:17,674
forth to

196
00:03:17,674 --> 00:03:17,621
baptize and to

197
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:17,568
teach as

198
00:03:17,568 --> 00:03:17,515
many as did

199
00:03:17,515 --> 00:03:17,462
come unto

200
00:03:17,462 --> 00:03:17,409
them; and as

201
00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:17,356
many as were

202

203
00:03:17,303 --> 00:03:17,25
the name of

204
00:03:17,25 --> 00:03:17,197

205
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:17,144

206
00:03:17,144 --> 00:03:17,631
Holy Ghost.

207
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:17,756
18 And many

208
00:03:17,756 --> 00:03:17,881
of them

209
00:03:17,881 --> 00:03:18,006
saw and heard

210
00:03:18,006 --> 00:03:18,131


211
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:18,256
unspeakable things,

212
00:03:18,256 --> 00:03:18,381
which are

213
00:03:18,381 --> 00:03:18,506
not lawful to

214
00:03:18,506 --> 00:03:18,098
be written.

215
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:18,021
19 And

216
00:03:18,021 --> 00:03:17,944
they taught,

217
00:03:17,944 --> 00:03:17,867
and did

218
00:03:17,867 --> 00:03:17,79
minister one

219
00:03:17,79 --> 00:03:17,713

220
00:03:17,713 --> 00:03:17,636
another; and

221
00:03:17,636 --> 00:03:17,559
they had all

222
00:03:17,559 --> 00:03:17,482
things

223
00:03:17,482 --> 00:03:17,405
common among

224
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:17,328
them,

225
00:03:17,328 --> 00:03:17,251
every man

228
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:17,742
20 And it

229
00:03:17,742 --> 00:03:17,853
came to

230
00:03:17,853 --> 00:03:17,964
pass that

231
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:18,075
they did

232
00:03:18,075 --> 00:03:18,186
do all

233
00:03:18,186 --> 00:03:18,297
things

234
00:03:18,297 --> 00:03:18,408
even as

235
00:03:18,408 --> 00:03:18,519
Jesus had

236
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:18,098
commanded them.

237
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:17,998
21 And

238
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:17,898
they who
