00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:08,0
Chapter 6 The Nephites prosper—Pride,

2
00:00:08,0 --> 00:00:16,0
wealth, and class distinctions arise—The Church is

3
00:00:16,0 --> 00:00:24,0
rent with dissensions—Satan leads the

4
00:00:24,0 --> 00:00:32,0
people in open rebellion—Many prophets cry

5
00:00:32,0 --> 00:00:40,0
repentance and are slain—Their murderers conspire

6
00:00:40,0 --> 00:00:48,315
to take over the government. About A.D. 26–30. 

7
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:48,148
1 And now it came to pass that the people

8
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:47,981
of the Nephites did all return to their

9
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:47,814
own lands in the twenty and sixth year,

10
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:47,647
every man, with his family, his flocks and

11
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:47,48
his herds, his horses and his cattle,

12
00:00:47,48 --> 00:00:47,381
and all things whatsoever did belong unto them.

13
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:47,281
2 And it came to pass that they had

14
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:47,181
not eaten up all their provisions;

15
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:47,081
therefore they did take with them all that

16
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:46,981
they had not devoured, of all their

17
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:46,881
grain of every kind, and their gold, and

18
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:46,781
their silver, and all their precious

19
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:46,681
things, and they did return to their

20
00:00:46,681 --> 00:00:46,581
own lands and their possessions, both

21
00:00:46,581 --> 00:00:46,481
on the north and on the south, both on

22
00:00:46,481 --> 00:00:46,446
the land northward and on the land southward.

23
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:46,946
3 And they granted unto those

24
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:47,446
robbers who had entered into a covenant to

25
00:00:47,446 --> 00:00:47,946
keep the peace of the land, who

26
00:00:47,946 --> 00:00:48,446
were desirous to remain Lamanites,

27
00:00:48,446 --> 00:00:48,946
lands, according to their numbers, that

28
00:00:48,946 --> 00:00:49,446
they might have, with their labors,

29
00:00:49,446 --> 00:00:49,946
wherewith to subsist upon; and thus

30
00:00:49,946 --> 00:00:50,851
they did establish peace in all the land.

31
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:52,684
4 And they began again to prosper

32
00:00:52,684 --> 00:00:54,517
and to wax great; and the twenty and

33
00:00:54,517 --> 00:00:56,35
sixth and seventh years passed

34
00:00:56,35 --> 00:00:58,183
away, and there was great order in the

35
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,016
land; and they had formed their

36
00:01:00,016 --> 00:01:01,228
laws according to equity and justice.

37
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:03,478
5 And now there was nothing in all

38
00:01:03,478 --> 00:01:05,728
the land to hinder the people

39
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:07,978
from prospering continually, except

40
00:01:07,978 --> 00:01:10,671
they should fall into transgression.

41
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:11,871
6 And now it was Gidgiddoni,

42
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:13,071
and the judge, Lachoneus, and

43
00:01:13,071 --> 00:01:14,271
those who had been appointed

44
00:01:14,271 --> 00:01:15,471
leaders, who had established

45
00:01:15,471 --> 00:01:16,076
this great peace in the land.

46
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,076
7 And it came to pass

47
00:01:17,076 --> 00:01:18,076
that there were many cities

48
00:01:18,076 --> 00:01:19,076
built anew, and there

49
00:01:19,076 --> 00:01:20,48
were many old cities repaired.

50
00:01:20,48 --> 00:01:20,813
8 And there were many

51
00:01:20,813 --> 00:01:21,146
highways cast up, and

52
00:01:21,146 --> 00:01:21,479
many roads made, which

53
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:21,812
led from city to

54
00:01:21,812 --> 00:01:22,145
city, and from land to

55
00:01:22,145 --> 00:01:22,883
land, and from place to place.

56
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:22,633
9 And thus passed

57
00:01:22,633 --> 00:01:22,383
away the twenty and

58
00:01:22,383 --> 00:01:22,133
eighth year, and the

59
00:01:22,133 --> 00:01:21,949
people had continual peace.

60
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:21,949
10 But it came to

61
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:21,949
pass in the twenty and

62
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:21,949
ninth year there

63
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:21,949
began to be some

64
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:21,949
disputings among the

65
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:21,949
people; and some were

66
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:21,949
lifted up unto pride

67
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:21,949
and boastings because

68
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:21,949
of their

69
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:21,949
exceedingly great riches, yea,

70
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:21,014
even unto great persecutions;

71
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:21,414
11 For there were

72
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:21,814
many merchants

73
00:01:21,814 --> 00:01:22,214
in the land, and

74
00:01:22,214 --> 00:01:22,614
also many lawyers,

75
00:01:22,614 --> 00:01:23,417
and many officers.

76
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:23,988
12 And the

77
00:01:23,988 --> 00:01:24,559
people began to be

78
00:01:24,559 --> 00:01:25,13
distinguished by

79
00:01:25,13 --> 00:01:25,701
ranks, according

80
00:01:25,701 --> 00:01:26,272
to their riches

81
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:26,843
and their

82
00:01:26,843 --> 00:01:27,414
chances for learning;

83
00:01:27,414 --> 00:01:27,985
yea, some were

84
00:01:27,985 --> 00:01:28,556
ignorant because

85
00:01:28,556 --> 00:01:29,127
of their

86
00:01:29,127 --> 00:01:29,698
poverty, and others did

87
00:01:29,698 --> 00:01:30,269
receive great

88
00:01:30,269 --> 00:01:30,84
learning because

89
00:01:30,84 --> 00:01:31,859
of their riches.

90
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:32,035
13 Some were

91
00:01:32,035 --> 00:01:32,211
lifted up in

92
00:01:32,211 --> 00:01:32,387
pride, and others

93
00:01:32,387 --> 00:01:32,563
were exceedingly

94
00:01:32,563 --> 00:01:32,739
humble; some

95
00:01:32,739 --> 00:01:32,915
did return

96
00:01:32,915 --> 00:01:33,091
railing for railing,

97
00:01:33,091 --> 00:01:33,267
while others

98
00:01:33,267 --> 00:01:33,443
would receive

99
00:01:33,443 --> 00:01:33,619
railing and

100
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:33,795
persecution and all

101
00:01:33,795 --> 00:01:33,971
manner of

102
00:01:33,971 --> 00:01:34,147
afflictions, and

103
00:01:34,147 --> 00:01:34,323
would not turn and

104
00:01:34,323 --> 00:01:34,499
revile again,

105
00:01:34,499 --> 00:01:34,675
but were humble

106
00:01:34,675 --> 00:01:34,261
and penitent before God.

107
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:34,813
14 And thus

108
00:01:34,813 --> 00:01:35,365
there became a

109
00:01:35,365 --> 00:01:35,917
great

110
00:01:35,917 --> 00:01:36,469
inequality in all the

111
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:37,021
land, insomuch

112
00:01:37,021 --> 00:01:37,573
that the

113
00:01:37,573 --> 00:01:38,125
church began to be

114
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:38,677
broken up;

115
00:01:38,677 --> 00:01:39,229
yea, insomuch

116
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:39,781
that in the

117
00:01:39,781 --> 00:01:40,333
thirtieth year the

118
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:40,885
church was

119
00:01:40,885 --> 00:01:41,437
broken up in all

120
00:01:41,437 --> 00:01:41,989
the land save

121
00:01:41,989 --> 00:01:42,541
it were among

122
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:43,093
a few of the

123
00:01:43,093 --> 00:01:43,645
Lamanites who

124
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:44,197
were converted

125
00:01:44,197 --> 00:01:44,749
unto the true

126
00:01:44,749 --> 00:01:45,301
faith; and

127
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:45,853
they would not

128
00:01:45,853 --> 00:01:46,405
depart from it,

129
00:01:46,405 --> 00:01:46,957
for they were

130
00:01:46,957 --> 00:01:47,509
firm, and

131
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:48,061
steadfast, and

132
00:01:48,061 --> 00:01:48,613
immovable,

133
00:01:48,613 --> 00:01:49,165
willing with all

134
00:01:49,165 --> 00:01:49,717
diligence to keep

135
00:01:49,717 --> 00:01:50,677
the commandments of the Lord.

136
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:51,677
15 Now the

137
00:01:51,677 --> 00:01:52,677
cause of this

138
00:01:52,677 --> 00:01:53,677
iniquity of

139
00:01:53,677 --> 00:01:54,677
the people was

140
00:01:54,677 --> 00:01:55,677
this—Satan

141
00:01:55,677 --> 00:01:56,677
had great

142
00:01:56,677 --> 00:01:57,677
power, unto the

143
00:01:57,677 --> 00:01:58,677
stirring up of

144
00:01:58,677 --> 00:01:59,677
the people to

145
00:01:59,677 --> 00:02:00,677
do all

146
00:02:00,677 --> 00:02:01,677
manner of

147
00:02:01,677 --> 00:02:02,677
iniquity, and to the

148
00:02:02,677 --> 00:02:03,677
puffing them

149
00:02:03,677 --> 00:02:04,677
up with

150
00:02:04,677 --> 00:02:05,677
pride, tempting

151
00:02:05,677 --> 00:02:06,677
them to seek

152
00:02:06,677 --> 00:02:07,677
for power, and

153
00:02:07,677 --> 00:02:08,677
authority,

154
00:02:08,677 --> 00:02:09,677
and riches, and

155
00:02:09,677 --> 00:02:10,998
the vain things of the world.

156
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:11,453
16 And thus

157
00:02:11,453 --> 00:02:11,908
Satan did

158
00:02:11,908 --> 00:02:12,363
lead away the

159
00:02:12,363 --> 00:02:12,818
hearts of

160
00:02:12,818 --> 00:02:13,273
the people to

161
00:02:13,273 --> 00:02:13,728
do all

162
00:02:13,728 --> 00:02:14,183
manner of

163
00:02:14,183 --> 00:02:14,638
iniquity; therefore

164
00:02:14,638 --> 00:02:15,093
they had

165
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:15,548
enjoyed peace

166
00:02:15,548 --> 00:02:15,402
but a few years.

167
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:15,563
17 And

168
00:02:15,563 --> 00:02:15,724
thus, in the

169
00:02:15,724 --> 00:02:15,885
commencement

170
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:16,046
of the

171
00:02:16,046 --> 00:02:16,207
thirtieth

172
00:02:16,207 --> 00:02:16,368
year—the people

173
00:02:16,368 --> 00:02:16,529
having been

174
00:02:16,529 --> 00:02:16,69
delivered

175
00:02:16,69 --> 00:02:16,851
up for the

176
00:02:16,851 --> 00:02:17,012
space of a

177
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:17,173
long time

178
00:02:17,173 --> 00:02:17,334
to be

179
00:02:17,334 --> 00:02:17,495
carried about by

180
00:02:17,495 --> 00:02:17,656
the

181
00:02:17,656 --> 00:02:17,817
temptations of the

182
00:02:17,817 --> 00:02:17,978
devil

183
00:02:17,978 --> 00:02:18,139
whithersoever

184
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:18,3
he desired

185
00:02:18,3 --> 00:02:18,461
to carry

186
00:02:18,461 --> 00:02:18,622
them, and to

187
00:02:18,622 --> 00:02:18,783
do

188
00:02:18,783 --> 00:02:18,944
whatsoever iniquity

189
00:02:18,944 --> 00:02:19,105
he desired

190
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:19,266
they

191
00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:19,427
should—and thus

192
00:02:19,427 --> 00:02:19,588
in the

193
00:02:19,588 --> 00:02:19,749
commencement of

194
00:02:19,749 --> 00:02:19,91
this, the

195
00:02:19,91 --> 00:02:20,071
thirtieth

196
00:02:20,071 --> 00:02:20,232
year, they

197
00:02:20,232 --> 00:02:20,807
were in a state of awful wickedness.

198
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:21,14
18 Now

199
00:02:21,14 --> 00:02:21,473
they did not

200
00:02:21,473 --> 00:02:21,806
sin

201
00:02:21,806 --> 00:02:22,139
ignorantly, for

202
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:22,472
they knew

203
00:02:22,472 --> 00:02:22,805
the will

204
00:02:22,805 --> 00:02:23,138
of God

205
00:02:23,138 --> 00:02:23,471
concerning

00:02:23,471 --> 00:02:23,804

210
00:02:24,803 --> 00:02:25,136
therefore

211
00:02:25,136 --> 00:02:25,469
they did

00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:25,212
wilfully rebel against God.

213
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:25,879

00:02:31,882 --> 00:02:32,549
the seat
