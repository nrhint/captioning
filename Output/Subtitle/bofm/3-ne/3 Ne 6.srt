00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:06,5
Chapter 6 The Nephites prosper—Pride, wealth, and

2
00:00:06,5 --> 00:00:13,0
 class distinctions arise—The Church is rent with

3
00:00:13,0 --> 00:00:19,5
 dissensions—Satan leads the people in open

4
00:00:19,5 --> 00:00:26,0
 rebellion—Many prophets cry repentance and are slain—Their

5
00:00:26,0 --> 00:00:32,5
 murderers conspire to take over the government.

6
00:00:32,5 --> 00:00:39,0
 About A.D. 26–30.

7
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:47,54
1 And now it came to pass that the people of the

8
00:00:47,54 --> 00:00:55,207
 Nephites did all return to their own lands in the

9
00:00:55,207 --> 00:01:02,874
 twenty and sixth year, every man, with his family,

10
00:01:02,874 --> 00:01:10,541
 his flocks and his herds, his horses and his

11
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:18,208
 cattle, and all things whatsoever did belong unto them

12
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:25,875


13
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:31,66
2 And it came to pass that they had not eaten up

14
00:01:31,66 --> 00:01:38,035
 all their provisions; therefore they did take with

15
00:01:38,035 --> 00:01:44,41
 them all that they had not devoured, of all their

16
00:01:44,41 --> 00:01:50,785
 grain of every kind, and their gold, and their

17
00:01:50,785 --> 00:01:57,16
 silver, and all their precious things, and they did

18
00:01:57,16 --> 00:02:03,535
 return to their own lands and their possessions,

19
00:02:03,535 --> 00:02:09,91
 both on the north and on the south, both on the land

20
00:02:09,91 --> 00:02:16,285
 northward and on the land southward

21
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:22,069
3 And they granted unto those robbers who had

22
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:27,902
 entered into a covenant to keep the peace of the land,

23
00:02:27,902 --> 00:02:33,735
 who were desirous to remain Lamanites, lands,

24
00:02:33,735 --> 00:02:39,568
 according to their numbers, that they might have,

25
00:02:39,568 --> 00:02:45,401
 with their labors, wherewith to subsist upon; and

26
00:02:45,401 --> 00:02:51,234
 thus they did establish peace in all the land

27
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:56,838
4 And they began again to prosper and to wax

28
00:02:56,838 --> 00:03:02,238
 great; and the twenty and sixth and seventh years

29
00:03:02,238 --> 00:03:07,638
 passed away, and there was great order in the land; and

30
00:03:07,638 --> 00:03:13,038
 they had formed their laws according to equity

31
00:03:13,038 --> 00:03:18,438
 and justice

32
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:24,566
5 And now there was nothing in all the land to

33
00:03:24,566 --> 00:03:30,233
 hinder the people from prospering continually, except

34
00:03:30,233 --> 00:03:35,9
 they should fall into transgression

35
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:43,483
6 And now it was Gidgiddoni, and the judge,

36
00:03:43,483 --> 00:03:51,15
 Lachoneus, and those who had been appointed leaders, who

37
00:03:51,15 --> 00:03:58,817
 had established this great peace in the land

38
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:03,572
7 And it came to pass that there were many cities

39
00:04:03,572 --> 00:04:08,572
 built anew, and there were many old cities

40
00:04:08,572 --> 00:04:13,572
 repaired

41
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:21,92
8 And there were many highways cast up, and many

42
00:04:21,92 --> 00:04:30,253
 roads made, which led from city to city, and from

43
00:04:30,253 --> 00:04:38,586
 land to land, and from place to place

44
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:44,679
9 And thus passed away the twenty and eighth year,

45
00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:50,679
 and the people had continual peace

46
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:56,391
10 But it came to pass in the twenty and ninth

47
00:04:56,391 --> 00:05:02,191
 year there began to be some disputings among the

48
00:05:02,191 --> 00:05:07,991
 people; and some were lifted up unto pride and

49
00:05:07,991 --> 00:05:13,791
 boastings because of their exceedingly great riches, yea,

50
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:19,591
 even unto great persecutions

51
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:26,819
11 For there were many merchants in the land, and

52
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:34,319
 also many lawyers, and many officers

53
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:39,568
12 And the people began to be distinguished by

54
00:05:39,568 --> 00:05:44,568
 ranks, according to their riches and their chances

55
00:05:44,568 --> 00:05:49,568
 for learning; yea, some were ignorant because of

56
00:05:49,568 --> 00:05:54,568
 their poverty, and others did receive great learning

57
00:05:54,568 --> 00:05:59,568
 because of their riches

58
00:05:59,86 --> 00:06:05,527
13 Some were lifted up in pride, and others were

59
00:06:05,527 --> 00:06:11,194
 exceedingly humble; some did return railing for

60
00:06:11,194 --> 00:06:16,861
 railing, while others would receive railing and

61
00:06:16,861 --> 00:06:22,528
 persecution and all manner of afflictions, and would

62
00:06:22,528 --> 00:06:28,195
 not turn and revile again, but were humble and

63
00:06:28,195 --> 00:06:33,862
 penitent before God

64
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:38,649
14 And thus there became a great inequality in all

65
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:44,205
 the land, insomuch that the church began to be

66
00:06:44,205 --> 00:06:49,761
 broken up; yea, insomuch that in the thirtieth year

67
00:06:49,761 --> 00:06:55,317
 the church was broken up in all the land save it

68
00:06:55,317 --> 00:07:00,873
 were among a few of the Lamanites who were

69
00:07:00,873 --> 00:07:06,429
 converted unto the true faith; and they would not depart

70
00:07:06,429 --> 00:07:11,985
 from it, for they were firm, and steadfast, and

71
00:07:11,985 --> 00:07:17,541
 immovable, willing with all diligence to keep the

72
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:23,097
 commandments of the Lord

73
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:29,61
15 Now the cause of this iniquity of the people

74
00:07:29,61 --> 00:07:35,943
 was this—Satan had great power, unto the stirring up

75
00:07:35,943 --> 00:07:42,276
 of the people to do all manner of iniquity, and

76
00:07:42,276 --> 00:07:48,609
 to the puffing them up with pride, tempting them to

77
00:07:48,609 --> 00:07:54,942
 seek for power, and authority, and riches, and

78
00:07:54,942 --> 00:08:01,275
 the vain things of the world

79
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:07,848
16 And thus Satan did lead away the hearts of the

80
00:08:07,848 --> 00:08:14,515
 people to do all manner of iniquity; therefore

81
00:08:14,515 --> 00:08:21,182
 they had enjoyed peace but a few years

82
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:27,06
17 And thus, in the commencement of the thirtieth

83
00:08:27,06 --> 00:08:32,185
 year—the people having been delivered up for the

84
00:08:32,185 --> 00:08:37,31
 space of a long time to be carried about by the

85
00:08:37,31 --> 00:08:42,435
 temptations of the devil whithersoever he desired to

86
00:08:42,435 --> 00:08:47,56
 carry them, and to do whatsoever iniquity he

87
00:08:47,56 --> 00:08:52,685
 desired they should—and thus in the commencement of

88
00:08:52,685 --> 00:08:57,81
 this, the thirtieth year, they were in a state of

89
00:08:57,81 --> 00:09:02,935
 awful wickedness

90
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:07,992
18 Now they did not sin ignorantly, for they knew

91
00:09:07,992 --> 00:09:13,742
 the will of God concerning them, for it had been

92
00:09:13,742 --> 00:09:19,492
 taught unto them; therefore they did wilfully rebel

93
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:25,242
 against God

94
00:09:25,332 --> 00:09:43,999
19 And now it was in the days of Lachoneus, the

95
00:09:43,999 --> 00:10:02,666
 son of Lachoneus, for Lachoneus did fill the seat of

96
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:21,333
 his father and did govern the people that year

97
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:22,154
20 And there began to be men inspired from heaven

98
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:23,154
 and sent forth, standing among the people in all

99
00:10:23,154 --> 00:10:24,154
 the land, preaching and testifying boldly of the

100
00:10:24,154 --> 00:10:25,154
 sins and iniquities of the people, and testifying

101
00:10:25,154 --> 00:10:26,154
 unto them concerning the redemption which the Lord

102
00:10:26,154 --> 00:10:27,154
 would make for his people, or in other words, the

103
00:10:27,154 --> 00:10:28,154
 resurrection of Christ; and they did testify boldly

104
00:10:28,154 --> 00:10:29,154
 of his death and sufferings

105
00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:35,134
21 Now there were many of the people who were

106
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:40,705
 exceedingly angry because of those who testified of

107
00:10:40,705 --> 00:10:46,276
 these things; and those who were angry were chiefly

108
00:10:46,276 --> 00:10:51,847
 the chief judges, and they who had been high

109
00:10:51,847 --> 00:10:57,418
 priests and lawyers; yea, all those who were lawyers

110
00:10:57,418 --> 00:11:02,989
 were angry with those who testified of these things

111
00:11:02,989 --> 00:11:08,56


112
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:14,719
22 Now there was no lawyer nor judge nor high

113
00:11:14,719 --> 00:11:20,469
 priest that could have power to condemn any one to

114
00:11:20,469 --> 00:11:26,219
 death save their condemnation was signed by the

115
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:31,969
 governor of the land

116
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:36,692
23 Now there were many of those who testified of

117
00:11:36,692 --> 00:11:41,692
 the things pertaining to Christ who testified

118
00:11:41,692 --> 00:11:46,692
 boldly, who were taken and put to death secretly by the

119
00:11:46,692 --> 00:11:51,692
 judges, that the knowledge of their death came

120
00:11:51,692 --> 00:11:56,692
 not unto the governor of the land until after their

121
00:11:56,692 --> 00:12:01,692
 death

122
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:08,255
24 Now behold, this was contrary to the laws of

123
00:12:08,255 --> 00:12:14,588
 the land, that any man should be put to death except

124
00:12:14,588 --> 00:12:20,921
 they had power from the governor of the land

125
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:25,957
25 Therefore a complaint came up unto the land of

126
00:12:25,957 --> 00:12:31,707
 Zarahemla, to the governor of the land, against

127
00:12:31,707 --> 00:12:37,457
 these judges who had condemned the prophets of the

128
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:43,207
 Lord unto death, not according to the law

129
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:47,897
26 Now it came to pass that they were taken and

130
00:12:47,897 --> 00:12:51,897
 brought up before the judge, to be judged of the

131
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:55,897
 crime which they had done, according to the law which

132
00:12:55,897 --> 00:12:59,897
 had been given by the people

133
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:04,58
27 Now it came to pass that those judges had many

134
00:13:04,58 --> 00:13:09,247
 friends and kindreds; and the remainder, yea, even

135
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:13,914
 almost all the lawyers and the high priests, did

136
00:13:13,914 --> 00:13:18,581
 gather themselves together, and unite with the

137
00:13:18,581 --> 00:13:23,248
 kindreds of those judges who were to be tried

138
00:13:23,248 --> 00:13:27,915
 according to the law

139
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:33,575
28 And they did enter into a covenant one with

140
00:13:33,575 --> 00:13:39,175
 another, yea, even into that covenant which was given

141
00:13:39,175 --> 00:13:44,775
 by them of old, which covenant was given and

142
00:13:44,775 --> 00:13:50,375
 administered by the devil, to combine against all

143
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:55,975
 righteousness

144
00:13:55,068 --> 00:14:00,268
29 Therefore they did combine against the people

145
00:14:00,268 --> 00:14:05,468
 of the Lord, and enter into a covenant to destroy

146
00:14:05,468 --> 00:14:10,668
 them, and to deliver those who were guilty of

147
00:14:10,668 --> 00:14:15,868
 murder from the grasp of justice, which was about to be

148
00:14:15,868 --> 00:14:21,068
 administered according to the law

149
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:26,361
30 And they did set at defiance the law and the

150
00:14:26,361 --> 00:14:31,361
 rights of their country; and they did covenant one

151
00:14:31,361 --> 00:14:36,361
 with another to destroy the governor, and to

152
00:14:36,361 --> 00:14:41,361
 establish a king over the land, that the land should no

153
00:14:41,361 --> 00:14:46,361
 more be at liberty but should be subject unto

154
00:14:46,361 --> 00:14:51,361
 kings.
