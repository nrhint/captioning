00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 6 The Nephites prosper—Pride,

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
wealth, and class distinctions arise—The Church is

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
rent with dissensions—Satan leads the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
people in open rebellion—Many prophets cry

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
repentance and are slain—Their murderers conspire

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:15:06,
to take over the government. About A.D. 26–30. 

7
00:15:06,0 --> 00:15:06,0
1 And now it came to pass that the people

8
00:15:06,0 --> 00:15:06,0
of the Nephites did all return to their

9
00:15:06,0 --> 00:15:06,0
own lands in the twenty and sixth year,

10
00:15:06,0 --> 00:15:06,0
every man, with his family, his flocks and

11
00:15:06,0 --> 00:15:06,0
his herds, his horses and his cattle,

12
00:15:06,0 --> 00:24:16,
and all things whatsoever did belong unto them.

13
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
2 And it came to pass that they had

14
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
not eaten up all their provisions;

15
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
therefore they did take with them all that

16
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
they had not devoured, of all their

17
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
grain of every kind, and their gold, and

18
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
their silver, and all their precious

19
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
things, and they did return to their

20
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
own lands and their possessions, both

21
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
on the north and on the south, both on

22
00:24:16,0 --> 00:23:48,
the land northward and on the land southward.

23
00:23:48,0 --> 00:23:48,0
3 And they granted unto those

24
00:23:48,0 --> 00:23:48,0
robbers who had entered into a covenant to

25
00:23:48,0 --> 00:23:48,0
keep the peace of the land, who

26
00:23:48,0 --> 00:23:48,0
were desirous to remain Lamanites,

27
00:23:48,0 --> 00:23:48,0
lands, according to their numbers, that

28
00:23:48,0 --> 00:23:48,0
they might have, with their labors,

29
00:23:48,0 --> 00:23:48,0
wherewith to subsist upon; and thus

30
00:23:48,0 --> 00:23:20,
they did establish peace in all the land.

31
00:23:20,0 --> 00:23:20,0
4 And they began again to prosper

32
00:23:20,0 --> 00:23:20,0
and to wax great; and the twenty and

33
00:23:20,0 --> 00:23:20,0
sixth and seventh years passed

34
00:23:20,0 --> 00:23:20,0
away, and there was great order in the

35
00:23:20,0 --> 00:23:20,0
land; and they had formed their

36
00:23:20,0 --> 00:25:32,
laws according to equity and justice.

37
00:25:32,0 --> 00:25:32,0
5 And now there was nothing in all

38
00:25:32,0 --> 00:25:32,0
the land to hinder the people

39
00:25:32,0 --> 00:25:32,0
from prospering continually, except

40
00:25:32,0 --> 00:33:02,
they should fall into transgression.

41
00:33:02,0 --> 00:33:02,0
6 And now it was Gidgiddoni,

42
00:33:02,0 --> 00:33:02,0
and the judge, Lachoneus, and

43
00:33:02,0 --> 00:33:02,0
those who had been appointed

44
00:33:02,0 --> 00:33:02,0
leaders, who had established

45
00:33:02,0 --> 00:35:14,
this great peace in the land.

46
00:35:14,0 --> 00:35:14,0
7 And it came to pass

47
00:35:14,0 --> 00:35:14,0
that there were many cities

48
00:35:14,0 --> 00:35:14,0
built anew, and there

49
00:35:14,0 --> 00:37:56,
were many old cities repaired.

50
00:37:56,0 --> 00:37:56,0
8 And there were many

51
00:37:56,0 --> 00:37:56,0
highways cast up, and

52
00:37:56,0 --> 00:37:56,0
many roads made, which

53
00:37:56,0 --> 00:37:56,0
led from city to

54
00:37:56,0 --> 00:37:56,0
city, and from land to

55
00:37:56,0 --> 00:40:08,
land, and from place to place.

56
00:40:08,0 --> 00:40:08,0
9 And thus passed

57
00:40:08,0 --> 00:40:08,0
away the twenty and

58
00:40:08,0 --> 00:40:08,0
eighth year, and the

59
00:40:08,0 --> 00:43:38,
people had continual peace.

60
00:43:38,0 --> 00:43:38,0
10 But it came to

61
00:43:38,0 --> 00:43:38,0
pass in the twenty and

62
00:43:38,0 --> 00:43:38,0
ninth year there

63
00:43:38,0 --> 00:43:38,0
began to be some

64
00:43:38,0 --> 00:43:38,0
disputings among the

65
00:43:38,0 --> 00:43:38,0
people; and some were

66
00:43:38,0 --> 00:43:38,0
lifted up unto pride

67
00:43:38,0 --> 00:43:38,0
and boastings because

68
00:43:38,0 --> 00:43:38,0
of their

69
00:43:38,0 --> 00:43:38,0
exceedingly great riches, yea,

70
00:43:38,0 --> 00:44:50,
even unto great persecutions;

71
00:44:50,0 --> 00:44:50,0
11 For there were

72
00:44:50,0 --> 00:44:50,0
many merchants

73
00:44:50,0 --> 00:44:50,0
in the land, and

74
00:44:50,0 --> 00:44:50,0
also many lawyers,

75
00:44:50,0 --> 00:46:02,
and many officers.

76
00:46:02,0 --> 00:46:02,0
12 And the

77
00:46:02,0 --> 00:46:02,0
people began to be

78
00:46:02,0 --> 00:46:02,0
distinguished by

79
00:46:02,0 --> 00:46:02,0
ranks, according

80
00:46:02,0 --> 00:46:02,0
to their riches

81
00:46:02,0 --> 00:46:02,0
and their

82
00:46:02,0 --> 00:46:02,0
chances for learning;

83
00:46:02,0 --> 00:46:02,0
yea, some were

84
00:46:02,0 --> 00:46:02,0
ignorant because

85
00:46:02,0 --> 00:46:02,0
of their

86
00:46:02,0 --> 00:46:02,0
poverty, and others did

87
00:46:02,0 --> 00:46:02,0
receive great

88
00:46:02,0 --> 00:46:02,0
learning because

89
00:46:02,0 --> 00:45:34,
of their riches.

90
00:45:34,0 --> 00:45:34,0
13 Some were

91
00:45:34,0 --> 00:45:34,0
lifted up in

92
00:45:34,0 --> 00:45:34,0
pride, and others

93
00:45:34,0 --> 00:45:34,0
were exceedingly

94
00:45:34,0 --> 00:45:34,0
humble; some

95
00:45:34,0 --> 00:45:34,0
did return

96
00:45:34,0 --> 00:45:34,0
railing for railing,

97
00:45:34,0 --> 00:45:34,0
while others

98
00:45:34,0 --> 00:45:34,0
would receive

99
00:45:34,0 --> 00:45:34,0
railing and

100
00:45:34,0 --> 00:45:34,0
persecution and all

101
00:45:34,0 --> 00:45:34,0
manner of

102
00:45:34,0 --> 00:45:34,0
afflictions, and

103
00:45:34,0 --> 00:45:34,0
would not turn and

104
00:45:34,0 --> 00:45:34,0
revile again,

105
00:45:34,0 --> 00:45:34,0
but were humble

106
00:45:34,0 --> 00:48:30,
and penitent before God.

107
00:48:30,0 --> 00:48:30,0
14 And thus

108
00:48:30,0 --> 00:48:30,0
there became a

109
00:48:30,0 --> 00:48:30,0
great

110
00:48:30,0 --> 00:48:30,0
inequality in all the

111
00:48:30,0 --> 00:48:30,0
land, insomuch

112
00:48:30,0 --> 00:48:30,0
that the

113
00:48:30,0 --> 00:48:30,0
church began to be

114
00:48:30,0 --> 00:48:30,0
broken up;

115
00:48:30,0 --> 00:48:30,0
yea, insomuch

116
00:48:30,0 --> 00:48:30,0
that in the

117
00:48:30,0 --> 00:48:30,0
thirtieth year the

118
00:48:30,0 --> 00:48:30,0
church was

119
00:48:30,0 --> 00:48:30,0
broken up in all

120
00:48:30,0 --> 00:48:30,0
the land save

121
00:48:30,0 --> 00:48:30,0
it were among

122
00:48:30,0 --> 00:48:30,0
a few of the

123
00:48:30,0 --> 00:48:30,0
Lamanites who

124
00:48:30,0 --> 00:48:30,0
were converted

125
00:48:30,0 --> 00:48:30,0
unto the true

126
00:48:30,0 --> 00:48:30,0
faith; and

127
00:48:30,0 --> 00:48:30,0
they would not

128
00:48:30,0 --> 00:48:30,0
depart from it,

129
00:48:30,0 --> 00:48:30,0
for they were

130
00:48:30,0 --> 00:48:30,0
firm, and

131
00:48:30,0 --> 00:48:30,0
steadfast, and

132
00:48:30,0 --> 00:48:30,0
immovable,

133
00:48:30,0 --> 00:48:30,0
willing with all

134
00:48:30,0 --> 00:48:30,0
diligence to keep

135
00:48:30,0 --> 00:48:02,
the commandments of the Lord.

136
00:48:02,0 --> 00:48:02,0
15 Now the

137
00:48:02,0 --> 00:48:02,0
cause of this

138
00:48:02,0 --> 00:48:02,0
iniquity of

139
00:48:02,0 --> 00:48:02,0
the people was

140
00:48:02,0 --> 00:48:02,0
this—Satan

141
00:48:02,0 --> 00:48:02,0
had great

142
00:48:02,0 --> 00:48:02,0
power, unto the

143
00:48:02,0 --> 00:48:02,0
stirring up of

144
00:48:02,0 --> 00:48:02,0
the people to

145
00:48:02,0 --> 00:48:02,0
do all

146
00:48:02,0 --> 00:48:02,0
manner of

147
00:48:02,0 --> 00:48:02,0
iniquity, and to the

148
00:48:02,0 --> 00:48:02,0
puffing them

149
00:48:02,0 --> 00:48:02,0
up with

150
00:48:02,0 --> 00:48:02,0
pride, tempting

151
00:48:02,0 --> 00:48:02,0
them to seek

152
00:48:02,0 --> 00:48:02,0
for power, and

153
00:48:02,0 --> 00:48:02,0
authority,

154
00:48:02,0 --> 00:48:02,0
and riches, and

155
00:48:02,0 --> 00:47:34,
the vain things of the world.

156
00:47:34,0 --> 00:47:34,0
16 And thus

157
00:47:34,0 --> 00:47:34,0
Satan did

158
00:47:34,0 --> 00:47:34,0
lead away the

159
00:47:34,0 --> 00:47:34,0
hearts of

160
00:47:34,0 --> 00:47:34,0
the people to

161
00:47:34,0 --> 00:47:34,0
do all

162
00:47:34,0 --> 00:47:34,0
manner of

163
00:47:34,0 --> 00:47:34,0
iniquity; therefore

164
00:47:34,0 --> 00:47:34,0
they had

165
00:47:34,0 --> 00:47:34,0
enjoyed peace

166
00:47:34,0 --> 00:57:29,
but a few years.

167
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:29,0
17 And

168
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:29,0
thus, in the

169
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:29,0
commencement

170
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:29,0
of the

171
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:29,0
thirtieth

172
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:29,0
year—the people

173
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:29,0
having been

174
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:29,0
delivered

175
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:29,0
up for the

176
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:29,0
space of a

177
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:29,0
long time

178
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:29,0
to be

179
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:29,0
carried about by

180
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:29,0
the

181
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:29,0
temptations of the

182
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:29,0
devil

183
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:29,0
whithersoever

184
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:29,0
he desired

185
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:29,0
to carry

186
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:29,0
them, and to

187
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:29,0
do

188
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:29,0
whatsoever iniquity

189
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:29,0
he desired

190
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:29,0
they

191
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:29,0
should—and thus

192
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:29,0
in the

193
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:29,0
commencement of

194
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:29,0
this, the

195
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:29,0
thirtieth

196
00:57:29,0 --> 00:57:29,0
year, they

197
00:57:29,0 --> 01:02:57,
were in a state of awful wickedness.

198
01:02:57,0 --> 01:02:57,0
18 Now

199
01:02:57,0 --> 01:02:57,0
they did not

200
01:02:57,0 --> 01:02:57,0
sin

201
01:02:57,0 --> 01:02:57,0
ignorantly, for

202
01:02:57,0 --> 01:02:57,0
they knew

203
01:02:57,0 --> 01:02:57,0
the will

204
01:02:57,0 --> 01:02:57,0
of God

205
01:02:57,0 --> 01:02:57,0
concerning

206
01:02:57,0 --> 01:02:57,0
them, for it

207
01:02:57,0 --> 01:02:57,0
had been

208
01:02:57,0 --> 01:02:57,0
taught unto

209
01:02:57,0 --> 01:02:57,0
them;

210
01:02:57,0 --> 01:02:57,0
therefore

211
01:02:57,0 --> 01:02:57,0
they did

212
01:02:57,0 --> 01:02:29,
wilfully rebel against God.

213
01:02:29,0 --> 01:02:29,0
19 And

214
01:02:29,0 --> 01:02:29,0
now it was

215
01:02:29,0 --> 01:02:29,0
in the

216
01:02:29,0 --> 01:02:29,0
days of

217
01:02:29,0 --> 01:02:29,0
Lachoneus,

218
01:02:29,0 --> 01:02:29,0
the son of

219
01:02:29,0 --> 01:02:29,0


220
01:02:29,0 --> 01:02:29,0
Lachoneus, for

221
01:02:29,0 --> 01:02:29,0
Lachoneus

222
01:02:29,0 --> 01:02:29,0
did fill
