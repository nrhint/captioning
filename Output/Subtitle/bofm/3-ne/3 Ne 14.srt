1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:09,0
Chapter 14 Jesus commands: Judge not; ask

2
00:00:09,0 --> 00:00:18,0
of God; beware of false prophets—He

3
00:00:18,0 --> 00:00:27,0
promises salvation to those who do the will of

4
00:00:27,0 --> 00:00:36,303
the Father—Compare 
Matthew 7. About A.D. 34. 

5
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:36,136
1 And now it came to pass that when

6
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:35,969
Jesus had spoken these words he

7
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:35,802
turned again to the multitude, and

8
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:35,635
did open his mouth unto them again,

9
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:35,468
saying: Verily, verily, I say unto

10
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:35,369
you, Judge not, that ye be not judged.

11
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:35,119
2 For with what judgment ye

12
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:34,869
judge, ye shall be judged; and

13
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:34,619
with what measure ye mete, it

14
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:34,434
shall be measured to you again.

15
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:35,434
3 And why beholdest thou the

16
00:00:35,434 --> 00:00:36,434
mote that is in thy brother’s

17
00:00:36,434 --> 00:00:37,434
eye, but considerest not the

18
00:00:37,434 --> 00:00:38,839
beam that is in thine own eye?

19
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:44,089
4 Or how wilt thou say to thy

20
00:00:44,089 --> 00:00:49,339
brother: Let me pull the

21
00:00:49,339 --> 00:00:54,589
mote out of thine eye—and

22
00:00:54,589 --> 00:00:59,159
behold, a beam is in thine own eye?

23
00:00:59,159 --> 00:00:59,959
5 Thou hypocrite, first

24
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:00,759
cast the beam out of thine

25
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:01,559
own eye; and then shalt

26
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:02,359
thou see clearly to cast the

27
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:03,563
mote out of thy brother’s eye.

28
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:03,896
6 Give not that which is

29
00:01:03,896 --> 00:01:04,23
holy unto the dogs, neither

30
00:01:04,23 --> 00:01:04,562
cast ye your pearls

31
00:01:04,562 --> 00:01:04,895
before swine, lest they trample

32
00:01:04,895 --> 00:01:05,228
them under their feet,

33
00:01:05,228 --> 00:01:05,966
and turn again and rend you.

34
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:11,466
7 Ask, and it shall be

35
00:01:11,466 --> 00:01:16,966
given unto you; seek, and

36
00:01:16,966 --> 00:01:22,466
ye shall find; knock, and

37
00:01:22,466 --> 00:01:27,287
it shall be opened unto you.

38
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:27,687
8 For every one that

39
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:28,087
asketh, receiveth; and he

40
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:28,487
that seeketh, findeth;

41
00:01:28,487 --> 00:01:28,887
and to him that

42
00:01:28,887 --> 00:01:29,69
knocketh, it shall be opened.

43
00:01:29,69 --> 00:01:30,44
9 Or what man is

44
00:01:30,44 --> 00:01:31,19
there of you, who, if

45
00:01:31,19 --> 00:01:31,94
his son ask bread,

46
00:01:31,94 --> 00:01:32,092
will give him a stone?

47
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:31,759
10 Or if he ask a

48
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:31,426
fish, will he

49
00:01:31,426 --> 00:01:31,158
give him a serpent?

50
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:31,058
11 If ye then,

51
00:01:31,058 --> 00:01:30,958
being evil, know

52
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:30,858
how to give good

53
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:30,758
gifts unto your

54
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:30,658
children, how

55
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:30,558
much more shall

56
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:30,458
your Father who

57
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:30,358
is in heaven give

58
00:01:30,358 --> 00:01:30,258
good things to

59
00:01:30,258 --> 00:01:30,691
them that ask him?

60
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:31,024
12 Therefore,

61
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:31,357
all things

62
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:31,69
whatsoever ye

63
00:01:31,69 --> 00:01:32,023
would that men

64
00:01:32,023 --> 00:01:32,356
should do to

65
00:01:32,356 --> 00:01:32,689
you, do ye even

66
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:33,022
so to them, for

67
00:01:33,022 --> 00:01:33,355
this is the

68
00:01:33,355 --> 00:01:33,093
law and the prophets.

69
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,184
13 Enter ye

70
00:01:35,184 --> 00:01:37,275
in at the

71
00:01:37,275 --> 00:01:39,366
strait gate; for

72
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:41,457
wide is the

73
00:01:41,457 --> 00:01:43,548
gate, and

74
00:01:43,548 --> 00:01:45,639
broad is the way,

75
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:47,73
which

76
00:01:47,73 --> 00:01:49,821
leadeth to

77
00:01:49,821 --> 00:01:51,912
destruction, and many

78
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:54,003
there be who

79
00:01:54,003 --> 00:01:56,049
go in thereat;

80
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:56,271
14 Because

81
00:01:56,271 --> 00:01:56,493
strait is the

82
00:01:56,493 --> 00:01:56,715
gate, and

83
00:01:56,715 --> 00:01:56,937
narrow is the

84
00:01:56,937 --> 00:01:57,159
way, which

85
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:57,381
leadeth unto

86
00:01:57,381 --> 00:01:57,603
life, and

87
00:01:57,603 --> 00:01:57,825
few there be

88
00:01:57,825 --> 00:01:58,452
that find it.

89
00:01:58,452 --> 00:01:58,896
15 Beware

90
00:01:58,896 --> 00:01:59,34
of false

91
00:01:59,34 --> 00:01:59,784
prophets, who

92
00:01:59,784 --> 00:02:00,228
come to you

93
00:02:00,228 --> 00:02:00,672
in sheep’s

94
00:02:00,672 --> 00:02:01,116
clothing,

95
00:02:01,116 --> 00:02:01,56
but

96
00:02:01,56 --> 00:02:02,004
inwardly they are

97
00:02:02,004 --> 00:02:02,856
ravening wolves.

98
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:04,967
16 Ye

99
00:02:04,967 --> 00:02:07,078
shall know

100
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:09,189
them by their

101
00:02:09,189 --> 00:02:11,3
fruits.

102
00:02:11,3 --> 00:02:13,411
Do men

103
00:02:13,411 --> 00:02:15,522
gather grapes

104
00:02:15,522 --> 00:02:17,633
of thorns,

105
00:02:17,633 --> 00:02:19,744
or figs

106
00:02:19,744 --> 00:02:21,208
of thistles?

107
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:22,408
17 Even

108
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:23,608
so every

109
00:02:23,608 --> 00:02:24,808
good tree

110
00:02:24,808 --> 00:02:26,008
bringeth

111
00:02:26,008 --> 00:02:27,208
forth

112
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:28,408
good fruit;

113
00:02:28,408 --> 00:02:29,608
but a

114
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:30,808
corrupt tree

115
00:02:30,808 --> 00:02:32,008
bringeth

116
00:02:32,008 --> 00:02:33,587
forth evil fruit.

117
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:34,86
18 A

118
00:02:34,86 --> 00:02:36,133
good tree

119
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:37,406
cannot

120
00:02:37,406 --> 00:02:38,679
bring

121
00:02:38,679 --> 00:02:39,952
forth evil

122
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:41,225
fruit,

123
00:02:41,225 --> 00:02:42,498
neither a

124
00:02:42,498 --> 00:02:43,771
corrupt

125
00:02:43,771 --> 00:02:45,044
tree

126
00:02:45,044 --> 00:02:46,317
bring forth

127
00:02:46,317 --> 00:02:47,901
good fruit.

128
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:48,446
19

129
00:02:48,446 --> 00:02:48,991
Every tree

130
00:02:48,991 --> 00:02:49,536
that

131
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:50,081
bringeth

132
00:02:50,081 --> 00:02:50,626
not

133
00:02:50,626 --> 00:02:51,171
forth good

134
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:51,716
fruit

135
00:02:51,716 --> 00:02:52,261
is hewn

136
00:02:52,261 --> 00:02:52,806
down,

137
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:53,351
and

138
00:02:53,351 --> 00:02:53,774
cast into the fire.

139
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:54,917
20

140
00:02:54,917 --> 00:02:56,06
Wherefore,

141
00:02:56,06 --> 00:02:57,203
by

142
00:02:57,203 --> 00:02:58,346
their

143
00:02:58,346 --> 00:02:59,489
fruits ye

144
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:00,632
shall

145
00:03:00,632 --> 00:03:01,748
know them.

146
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:02,653
21 Not

147
00:03:02,653 --> 00:03:03,558
every

148
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:04,463
one

149
00:03:04,463 --> 00:03:05,368
that

150
00:03:05,368 --> 00:03:06,273
saith

151
00:03:06,273 --> 00:03:07,178
unto me,

152
00:03:07,178 --> 00:03:08,083
Lord,

153
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:08,988
Lord,

154
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:09,893
shall

155
00:03:09,893 --> 00:03:10,798
enter

156
00:03:10,798 --> 00:03:11,703
into

157
00:03:11,703 --> 00:03:12,608
the

158
00:03:12,608 --> 00:03:13,513
kingdom

159
00:03:13,513 --> 00:03:14,418
of

160
00:03:14,418 --> 00:03:15,323
heaven;

161
00:03:15,323 --> 00:03:16,228
but he

162
00:03:16,228 --> 00:03:17,133
that

163
00:03:17,133 --> 00:03:18,038
doeth

164
00:03:18,038 --> 00:03:18,943
the

165
00:03:18,943 --> 00:03:19,848
will of

166
00:03:19,848 --> 00:03:20,067
my Father who is in heaven.

167
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:20,531
22

168
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:20,995
Many

169
00:03:20,995 --> 00:03:21,459
will

170
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:21,923
say to

171
00:03:21,923 --> 00:03:22,387
me in

172
00:03:22,387 --> 00:03:22,851
that

173
00:03:22,851 --> 00:03:23,315
day:

174
00:03:23,315 --> 00:03:23,779


175
00:03:23,779 --> 00:03:24,243
Lord,

176
00:03:24,243 --> 00:03:24,707
Lord,

177
00:03:24,707 --> 00:03:25,171
have we

178
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:25,635

179
00:03:25,635 --> 00:03:26,099


180
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:26,563
prophesied

181
00:03:26,563 --> 00:03:27,027

190
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:31,203

And

197
00:03:34,862 --> 00:03:35,336
then

198
00:03:35,336 --> 00:03:35,81
