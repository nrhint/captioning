00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 14 Jesus commands: Judge not; ask

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of God; beware of false prophets—He

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
promises salvation to those who do the will of

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:11:07,
the Father—Compare 
Matthew 7. About A.D. 34. 

5
00:11:07,0 --> 00:11:07,0
1 And now it came to pass that when

6
00:11:07,0 --> 00:11:07,0
Jesus had spoken these words he

7
00:11:07,0 --> 00:11:07,0
turned again to the multitude, and

8
00:11:07,0 --> 00:11:07,0
did open his mouth unto them again,

9
00:11:07,0 --> 00:11:07,0
saying: Verily, verily, I say unto

10
00:11:07,0 --> 00:10:39,
you, Judge not, that ye be not judged.

11
00:10:39,0 --> 00:10:39,0
2 For with what judgment ye

12
00:10:39,0 --> 00:10:39,0
judge, ye shall be judged; and

13
00:10:39,0 --> 00:10:39,0
with what measure ye mete, it

14
00:10:39,0 --> 00:14:10,
shall be measured to you again.

15
00:14:10,0 --> 00:14:10,0
3 And why beholdest thou the

16
00:14:10,0 --> 00:14:10,0
mote that is in thy brother’s

17
00:14:10,0 --> 00:14:10,0
eye, but considerest not the

18
00:14:10,0 --> 00:16:52,
beam that is in thine own eye?

19
00:16:52,0 --> 00:16:52,0
4 Or how wilt thou say to thy

20
00:16:52,0 --> 00:16:52,0
brother: Let me pull the

21
00:16:52,0 --> 00:16:52,0
mote out of thine eye—and

22
00:16:52,0 --> 00:16:24,
behold, a beam is in thine own eye?

23
00:16:24,0 --> 00:16:24,0
5 Thou hypocrite, first

24
00:16:24,0 --> 00:16:24,0
cast the beam out of thine

25
00:16:24,0 --> 00:16:24,0
own eye; and then shalt

26
00:16:24,0 --> 00:16:24,0
thou see clearly to cast the

27
00:16:24,0 --> 00:15:56,
mote out of thy brother’s eye.

28
00:15:56,0 --> 00:15:56,0
6 Give not that which is

29
00:15:56,0 --> 00:15:56,0
holy unto the dogs, neither

30
00:15:56,0 --> 00:15:56,0
cast ye your pearls

31
00:15:56,0 --> 00:15:56,0
before swine, lest they trample

32
00:15:56,0 --> 00:15:56,0
them under their feet,

33
00:15:56,0 --> 00:17:08,
and turn again and rend you.

34
00:17:08,0 --> 00:17:08,0
7 Ask, and it shall be

35
00:17:08,0 --> 00:17:08,0
given unto you; seek, and

36
00:17:08,0 --> 00:17:08,0
ye shall find; knock, and

37
00:17:08,0 --> 00:19:20,
it shall be opened unto you.

38
00:19:20,0 --> 00:19:20,0
8 For every one that

39
00:19:20,0 --> 00:19:20,0
asketh, receiveth; and he

40
00:19:20,0 --> 00:19:20,0
that seeketh, findeth;

41
00:19:20,0 --> 00:19:20,0
and to him that

42
00:19:20,0 --> 00:25:31,
knocketh, it shall be opened.

43
00:25:31,0 --> 00:25:31,0
9 Or what man is

44
00:25:31,0 --> 00:25:31,0
there of you, who, if

45
00:25:31,0 --> 00:25:31,0
his son ask bread,

46
00:25:31,0 --> 00:31:14,
will give him a stone?

47
00:31:14,0 --> 00:31:14,0
10 Or if he ask a

48
00:31:14,0 --> 00:31:14,0
fish, will he

49
00:31:14,0 --> 00:32:12,
give him a serpent?

50
00:32:12,0 --> 00:32:12,0
11 If ye then,

51
00:32:12,0 --> 00:32:12,0
being evil, know

52
00:32:12,0 --> 00:32:12,0
how to give good

53
00:32:12,0 --> 00:32:12,0
gifts unto your

54
00:32:12,0 --> 00:32:12,0
children, how

55
00:32:12,0 --> 00:32:12,0
much more shall

56
00:32:12,0 --> 00:32:12,0
your Father who

57
00:32:12,0 --> 00:32:12,0
is in heaven give

58
00:32:12,0 --> 00:32:12,0
good things to

59
00:32:12,0 --> 00:31:44,
them that ask him?

60
00:31:44,0 --> 00:31:44,0
12 Therefore,

61
00:31:44,0 --> 00:31:44,0
all things

62
00:31:44,0 --> 00:31:44,0
whatsoever ye

63
00:31:44,0 --> 00:31:44,0
would that men

64
00:31:44,0 --> 00:31:44,0
should do to

65
00:31:44,0 --> 00:31:44,0
you, do ye even

66
00:31:44,0 --> 00:31:44,0
so to them, for

67
00:31:44,0 --> 00:31:44,0
this is the

68
00:31:44,0 --> 00:31:16,
law and the prophets.

69
00:31:16,0 --> 00:31:16,0
13 Enter ye

70
00:31:16,0 --> 00:31:16,0
in at the

71
00:31:16,0 --> 00:31:16,0
strait gate; for

72
00:31:16,0 --> 00:31:16,0
wide is the

73
00:31:16,0 --> 00:31:16,0
gate, and

74
00:31:16,0 --> 00:31:16,0
broad is the way,

75
00:31:16,0 --> 00:31:16,0
which

76
00:31:16,0 --> 00:31:16,0
leadeth to

77
00:31:16,0 --> 00:31:16,0
destruction, and many

78
00:31:16,0 --> 00:31:16,0
there be who

79
00:31:16,0 --> 00:32:28,
go in thereat;

80
00:32:28,0 --> 00:32:28,0
14 Because

81
00:32:28,0 --> 00:32:28,0
strait is the

82
00:32:28,0 --> 00:32:28,0
gate, and

83
00:32:28,0 --> 00:32:28,0
narrow is the

84
00:32:28,0 --> 00:32:28,0
way, which

85
00:32:28,0 --> 00:32:28,0
leadeth unto

86
00:32:28,0 --> 00:32:28,0
life, and

87
00:32:28,0 --> 00:32:28,0
few there be

88
00:32:28,0 --> 00:35:59,
that find it.

89
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
15 Beware

90
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
of false

91
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
prophets, who

92
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
come to you

93
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
in sheep’s

94
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
clothing,

95
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
but

96
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
inwardly they are

97
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,
ravening wolves.

98
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
16 Ye

99
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
shall know

100
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
them by their

101
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
fruits.

102
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
Do men

103
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
gather grapes

104
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
of thorns,

105
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
or figs

106
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,
of thistles?

107
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
17 Even

108
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
so every

109
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
good tree

110
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
bringeth

111
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
forth

112
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
good fruit;

113
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
but a

114
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
corrupt tree

115
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
bringeth

116
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,
forth evil fruit.

117
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
18 A

118
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
good tree

119
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
cannot

120
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
bring

121
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
forth evil

122
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
fruit,

123
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
neither a

124
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
corrupt

125
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
tree

126
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
bring forth

127
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,
good fruit.

128
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
19

129
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
Every tree

130
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
that

131
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
bringeth

132
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
not

133
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
forth good

134
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
fruit

135
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
is hewn

136
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
down,

137
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
and

138
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,
cast into the fire.

139
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
20

140
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
Wherefore,

141
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
by

142
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
their

143
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
fruits ye

144
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
shall

145
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,
know them.

146
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
21 Not

147
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
every

148
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
one

149
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
that

150
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
saith

151
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
unto me,

152
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
Lord,

153
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
Lord,

154
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
shall

155
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
enter

156
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
into

157
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
the

158
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
kingdom

159
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
of

160
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
heaven;

161
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
but he

162
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
that

163
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
doeth

164
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
the

165
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
will of

166
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,
my Father who is in heaven.

167
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
22

168
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
Many

169
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
will

170
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
say to

171
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
me in

172
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
that

173
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
day:

174
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0


175
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
Lord,

176
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
Lord,

177
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
have we

178
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
not

179
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0


180
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
prophesied

181
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
in

182
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
thy

183
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
name,

184
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
and in

185
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
thy

186
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
name

187
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
have

188
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
cast

189
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
out

190
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0


191
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
devils, and

192
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
in

193
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0

00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,
name done many wonderful works?

195
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
23

196
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
And

197
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
then

198
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
will

199
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
I

200
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0


201
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
profess

202
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
unto

203
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0


204
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
them: I

205
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0


206
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
never

207
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
knew

208
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
you;

209
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0


210
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
depart

211
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
from

212
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
me,

213
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,
ye that work iniquity.

214
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
24

215
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0


216
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0


217
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
Therefore,

218
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
whoso

219
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0


220
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
heareth

221
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0


222
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
these

223
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0


224
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
sayings of

225
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0


226
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
mine

227
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
and

228
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
doeth

229
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
