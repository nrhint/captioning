00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,75
Chapter 14 Jesus commands: Judge not; ask of God;

2
00:00:01,75 --> 00:00:03,5
 beware of false prophets—He promises salvation to

3
00:00:03,5 --> 00:00:05,25
 those who do the will of the Father—Compare

4
00:00:05,25 --> 00:00:07,0
Matthew 7. About A.D. 34.

5
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:11,175
1 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had

6
00:00:11,175 --> 00:00:14,375
 spoken these words he turned again to the multitude,

7
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:17,575
 and did open his mouth unto them again, saying:

8
00:00:17,575 --> 00:00:20,775
 Verily, verily, I say unto you, Judge not, that ye be

9
00:00:20,775 --> 00:00:23,975
 not judged

10
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:29,257
2 For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be

11
00:00:29,257 --> 00:00:34,59
 judged; and with what measure ye mete, it shall be

12
00:00:34,59 --> 00:00:39,923
 measured to you again

13
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:40,873
3 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy

14
00:00:40,873 --> 00:00:41,873
 brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is

15
00:00:41,873 --> 00:00:42,873
 in thine own eye

16
00:00:42,276 --> 00:00:44,943
4 Or how wilt thou say to thy brother: Let me pull

17
00:00:44,943 --> 00:00:47,61
 the mote out of thine eye—and behold, a beam is

18
00:00:47,61 --> 00:00:50,277
 in thine own eye

19
00:00:50,25 --> 00:00:52,917
5 Thou hypocrite, first cast the beam out of thine

20
00:00:52,917 --> 00:00:55,584
 own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast

21
00:00:55,584 --> 00:00:58,251
 the mote out of thy brother’s eye

22
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,225
6 Give not that which is holy unto the dogs,

23
00:01:00,225 --> 00:01:02,225
 neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they

24
00:01:02,225 --> 00:01:04,225
 trample them under their feet, and turn again and

25
00:01:04,225 --> 00:01:06,225
 rend you

26
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:08,866
7 Ask, and it shall be given unto you; seek, and

27
00:01:08,866 --> 00:01:11,533
 ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto

28
00:01:11,533 --> 00:01:14,2
 you

29
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:19,507
8 For every one that asketh, receiveth; and he

30
00:01:19,507 --> 00:01:24,84
 that seeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, it

31
00:01:24,84 --> 00:01:30,173
 shall be opened

32
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:38,123
9 Or what man is there of you, who, if his son ask

33
00:01:38,123 --> 00:01:46,123
 bread, will give him a stone

34
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:50,073
10 Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a

35
00:01:50,073 --> 00:01:54,073
 serpent

36
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:56,047
11 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good

37
00:01:56,047 --> 00:01:58,047
 gifts unto your children, how much more shall your

38
00:01:58,047 --> 00:02:00,047
 Father who is in heaven give good things to them

39
00:02:00,047 --> 00:02:02,047
 that ask him

40
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:04,355
12 Therefore, all things whatsoever ye would that

41
00:02:04,355 --> 00:02:06,688
 men should do to you, do ye even so to them, for

42
00:02:06,688 --> 00:02:09,021
 this is the law and the prophets

43
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:12,664
13 Enter ye in at the strait gate; for wide is the

44
00:02:12,664 --> 00:02:15,331
 gate, and broad is the way, which leadeth to

45
00:02:15,331 --> 00:02:17,998
 destruction, and many there be who go in thereat

46
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,638
14 Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the

47
00:02:20,638 --> 00:02:23,305
 way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that

48
00:02:23,305 --> 00:02:25,972
 find it

49
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:28,613
15 Beware of false prophets, who come to you in

50
00:02:28,613 --> 00:02:31,28
 sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening

51
00:02:31,28 --> 00:02:33,947
 wolves

52
00:02:33,92 --> 00:02:37,92
16 Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men

53
00:02:37,92 --> 00:02:41,92
 gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles

54
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:49,895
17 Even so every good tree bringeth forth good

55
00:02:49,895 --> 00:02:57,895
 fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit

56
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:05,844
18 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit,

57
00:03:05,844 --> 00:03:13,844
 neither a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit

58
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:25,794
19 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit

59
00:03:25,794 --> 00:03:37,794
 is hewn down, and cast into the fire

60
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:45,718
20 Wherefore, by their fruits ye shall know them

61
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:48,359
21 Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord,

62
00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:51,026
 shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that

63
00:03:51,026 --> 00:03:53,693
 doeth the will of my Father who is in heaven

64
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:59,667
22 Many will say to me in that day: Lord, Lord,

65
00:03:59,667 --> 00:04:05,667
 have we not prophesied in thy name, and in thy name

66
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:11,667
 have cast out devils, and in thy name done many

67
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:17,667
 wonderful works

68
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:25,591
23 And then will I profess unto them: I never knew

69
00:04:25,591 --> 00:04:33,591
 you; depart from me, ye that work iniquity

70
00:04:33,54 --> 00:04:36,207
24 Therefore, whoso heareth these sayings of mine

71
00:04:36,207 --> 00:04:38,874
 and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man,

72
00:04:38,874 --> 00:04:41,541
 who built his house upon a rock

73
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:44,182
25 And the rain descended, and the floods came,

74
00:04:44,182 --> 00:04:46,849
 and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it

75
00:04:46,849 --> 00:04:49,516
 fell not, for it was founded upon a rock

76
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:52,156
26 And every one that heareth these sayings of

77
00:04:52,156 --> 00:04:54,823
 mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a

78
00:04:54,823 --> 00:04:57,49
 foolish man, who built his house upon the sand

79
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:57,797
27 And the rain descended, and the floods came,

80
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:58,13
 and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it

81
00:04:58,13 --> 00:04:58,463
 fell, and great was the fall of it.
