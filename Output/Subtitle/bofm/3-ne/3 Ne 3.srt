1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:09,0
Chapter 3 Giddianhi, the Gadianton leader, demands

2
00:00:09,0 --> 00:00:18,0
 that Lachoneus and the Nephites surrender

3
00:00:18,0 --> 00:00:27,0
 themselves and their lands—Lachoneus appoints Gidgiddoni

4
00:00:27,0 --> 00:00:36,0
 as chief captain of the armies—The Nephites

5
00:00:36,0 --> 00:00:45,0
 assemble in Zarahemla and Bountiful to defend

6
00:00:45,0 --> 00:00:54,0
 themselves. About A.D. 16–18.

7
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:59,354
1 And now it came to pass that in the sixteenth

8
00:00:59,354 --> 00:01:04,554
 year from the coming of Christ, Lachoneus, the

9
00:01:04,554 --> 00:01:09,754
 governor of the land, received an epistle from the

10
00:01:09,754 --> 00:01:14,954
 leader and the governor of this band of robbers; and

11
00:01:14,954 --> 00:01:20,154
 these were the words which were written, saying

12
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:27,247
2 Lachoneus, most noble and chief governor of the

13
00:01:27,247 --> 00:01:33,58
 land, behold, I write this epistle unto you, and

14
00:01:33,58 --> 00:01:39,913
 do give unto you exceedingly great praise because

15
00:01:39,913 --> 00:01:46,246
 of your firmness, and also the firmness of your

16
00:01:46,246 --> 00:01:52,579
 people, in maintaining that which ye suppose to be

17
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:58,912
 your right and liberty; yea, ye do stand well, as if

18
00:01:58,912 --> 00:02:05,245
 ye were supported by the hand of a god, in the

19
00:02:05,245 --> 00:02:11,578
 defence of your liberty, and your property, and your

20
00:02:11,578 --> 00:02:17,911
 country, or that which ye do call so

21
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:23,838
3 And it seemeth a pity unto me, most noble

22
00:02:23,838 --> 00:02:29,838
 Lachoneus, that ye should be so foolish and vain as to

23
00:02:29,838 --> 00:02:35,838
 suppose that ye can stand against so many brave men

24
00:02:35,838 --> 00:02:41,838
 who are at my command, who do now at this time

25
00:02:41,838 --> 00:02:47,838
 stand in their arms, and do await with great anxiety

26
00:02:47,838 --> 00:02:53,838
 for the word—Go down upon the Nephites and

27
00:02:53,838 --> 00:02:59,838
 destroy them

28
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:06,913
4 And I, knowing of their unconquerable spirit,

29
00:03:06,913 --> 00:03:14,08
 having proved them in the field of battle, and

30
00:03:14,08 --> 00:03:21,247
 knowing of their everlasting hatred towards you because

31
00:03:21,247 --> 00:03:28,414
 of the many wrongs which ye have done unto them,

32
00:03:28,414 --> 00:03:35,581
 therefore if they should come down against you

33
00:03:35,581 --> 00:03:42,748
 they would visit you with utter destruction

34
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:46,455
5 Therefore I have written this epistle, sealing

35
00:03:46,455 --> 00:03:50,655
 it with mine own hand, feeling for your welfare,

36
00:03:50,655 --> 00:03:54,855
 because of your firmness in that which ye believe to

37
00:03:54,855 --> 00:03:59,055
 be right, and your noble spirit in the field of

38
00:03:59,055 --> 00:04:03,255
 battle

39
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:09,177
6 Therefore I write unto you, desiring that ye

40
00:04:09,177 --> 00:04:14,577
 would yield up unto this my people, your cities, your

41
00:04:14,577 --> 00:04:19,977
 lands, and your possessions, rather than that

42
00:04:19,977 --> 00:04:25,377
 they should visit you with the sword and that

43
00:04:25,377 --> 00:04:30,777
 destruction should come upon you

44
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:36,636
7 Or in other words, yield yourselves up unto us,

45
00:04:36,636 --> 00:04:43,236
 and unite with us and become acquainted with our

46
00:04:43,236 --> 00:04:49,836
 secret works, and become our brethren that ye may

47
00:04:49,836 --> 00:04:56,436
 be like unto us—not our slaves, but our brethren

48
00:04:56,436 --> 00:05:03,036
 and partners of all our substance

49
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:09,862
8 And behold, I swear unto you, if ye will do

50
00:05:09,862 --> 00:05:15,987
 this, with an oath, ye shall not be destroyed; but if

51
00:05:15,987 --> 00:05:22,112
 ye will not do this, I swear unto you with an

52
00:05:22,112 --> 00:05:28,237
 oath, that on the morrow month I will command that my

53
00:05:28,237 --> 00:05:34,362
 armies shall come down against you, and they shall

54
00:05:34,362 --> 00:05:40,487
 not stay their hand and shall spare not, but

55
00:05:40,487 --> 00:05:46,612
 shall slay you, and shall let fall the sword upon you

56
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:52,737
 even until ye shall become extinct

57
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:58,286
9 And behold, I am Giddianhi; and I am the

58
00:05:58,286 --> 00:06:03,886
 governor of this the secret society of Gadianton; which

59
00:06:03,886 --> 00:06:09,486
 society and the works thereof I know to be good;

60
00:06:09,486 --> 00:06:15,086
 and they are of ancient date and they have been

61
00:06:15,086 --> 00:06:20,686
 handed down unto us

62
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:38,614
10 And I write this epistle unto you, Lachoneus,

63
00:06:38,614 --> 00:06:56,614
 and I hope that ye will deliver up your lands and

64
00:06:56,614 --> 00:07:14,614
 your possessions, without the shedding of blood,

65
00:07:14,614 --> 00:07:32,614
 that this my people may recover their rights and

66
00:07:32,614 --> 00:07:50,614
 government, who have dissented away from you because

67
00:07:50,614 --> 00:08:08,614
 of your wickedness in retaining from them their

68
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:26,614
 rights of government, and except ye do this, I will

69
00:08:26,614 --> 00:08:44,614
 avenge their wrongs. I am Giddianhi

70
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:45,157
11 And now it came to pass when Lachoneus received

71
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:46,157
 this epistle he was exceedingly astonished,

72
00:08:46,157 --> 00:08:47,157
 because of the boldness of Giddianhi demanding the

73
00:08:47,157 --> 00:08:48,157
 possession of the land of the Nephites, and also of

74
00:08:48,157 --> 00:08:49,157
 threatening the people and avenging the wrongs of

75
00:08:49,157 --> 00:08:50,157
 those that had received no wrong, save it were they

76
00:08:50,157 --> 00:08:51,157
 had wronged themselves by dissenting away unto

77
00:08:51,157 --> 00:08:52,157
 those wicked and abominable robbers

78
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:52,132
12 Now behold, this Lachoneus, the governor, was a

79
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:52,132
 just man, and could not be frightened by the

80
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:52,132
 demands and the threatenings of a robber; therefore he

81
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:52,132
 did not hearken to the epistle of Giddianhi, the

82
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:52,132
 governor of the robbers, but he did cause that his

83
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:52,132
 people should cry unto the Lord for strength

84
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:52,132
 against the time that the robbers should come down

85
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:52,132
 against them

86
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,599
13 Yea, he sent a proclamation among all the

87
00:08:56,599 --> 00:09:00,399
 people, that they should gather together their women,

88
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,199
 and their children, their flocks and their herds,

89
00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:07,999
 and all their substance, save it were their land,

90
00:09:07,999 --> 00:09:11,799
 unto one place

91
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:17,535
14 And he caused that fortifications should be

92
00:09:17,535 --> 00:09:23,285
 built round about them, and the strength thereof

93
00:09:23,285 --> 00:09:29,035
 should be exceedingly great. And he caused that

94
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:34,785
 armies, both of the Nephites and of the Lamanites, or of

95
00:09:34,785 --> 00:09:40,535
 all them who were numbered among the Nephites,

96
00:09:40,535 --> 00:09:46,285
 should be placed as guards round about to watch

97
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:52,035
 them, and to guard them from the robbers day and

98
00:09:52,035 --> 00:09:57,785
 night

99
00:09:57,464 --> 00:10:03,714
15 Yea, he said unto them: As the Lord liveth,

100
00:10:03,714 --> 00:10:09,964
 except ye repent of all your iniquities, and cry unto

101
00:10:09,964 --> 00:10:16,214
 the Lord, ye will in nowise be delivered out of

102
00:10:16,214 --> 00:10:22,464
 the hands of those Gadianton robbers

103
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:28,556
16 And so great and marvelous were the words and

104
00:10:28,556 --> 00:10:34,156
 prophecies of Lachoneus that they did cause fear to

105
00:10:34,156 --> 00:10:39,756
 come upon all the people; and they did exert

106
00:10:39,756 --> 00:10:45,356
 themselves in their might to do according to the words

107
00:10:45,356 --> 00:10:50,956
 of Lachoneus

108
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:55,916
17 And it came to pass that Lachoneus did appoint

109
00:10:55,916 --> 00:11:01,416
 chief captains over all the armies of the

110
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:06,916
 Nephites, to command them at the time that the robbers

111
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:12,416
 should come down out of the wilderness against them

112
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:17,438
18 Now the chiefest among all the chief captains

113
00:11:17,438 --> 00:11:22,438
 and the great commander of all the armies of the

114
00:11:22,438 --> 00:11:27,438
 Nephites was appointed, and his name was Gidgiddoni

115
00:11:27,438 --> 00:11:32,438


116
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:42,192
19 Now it was the custom among all the Nephites to

117
00:11:42,192 --> 00:11:51,692
 appoint for their chief captains, (save it were

118
00:11:51,692 --> 00:12:01,192
 in their times of wickedness) some one that had the

119
00:12:01,192 --> 00:12:10,692
 spirit of revelation and also prophecy;

120
00:12:10,692 --> 00:12:20,192
 therefore, this Gidgiddoni was a great prophet among them,

121
00:12:20,192 --> 00:12:29,692
 as also was the chief judge

122
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:31,765
20 Now the people said unto Gidgiddoni: Pray unto

123
00:12:31,765 --> 00:12:34,515
 the Lord, and let us go up upon the mountains and

124
00:12:34,515 --> 00:12:37,265
 into the wilderness, that we may fall upon the

125
00:12:37,265 --> 00:12:40,015
 robbers and destroy them in their own lands

126
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:47,216
21 But Gidgiddoni saith unto them: The Lord

127
00:12:47,216 --> 00:12:53,438
 forbid; for if we should go up against them the Lord

128
00:12:53,438 --> 00:12:59,66
 would deliver us into their hands; therefore we will

129
00:12:59,66 --> 00:13:05,882
 prepare ourselves in the center of our lands, and

130
00:13:05,882 --> 00:13:12,104
 we will gather all our armies together, and we

131
00:13:12,104 --> 00:13:18,326
 will not go against them, but we will wait till they

132
00:13:18,326 --> 00:13:24,548
 shall come against us; therefore as the Lord

133
00:13:24,548 --> 00:13:30,77
 liveth, if we do this he will deliver them into our

134
00:13:30,77 --> 00:13:36,992
 hands

135
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:42,18
22 And it came to pass in the seventeenth year, in

136
00:13:42,18 --> 00:13:47,544
 the latter end of the year, the proclamation of

137
00:13:47,544 --> 00:13:52,908
 Lachoneus had gone forth throughout all the face of

138
00:13:52,908 --> 00:13:58,272
 the land, and they had taken their horses, and

139
00:13:58,272 --> 00:14:03,636
 their chariots, and their cattle, and all their

140
00:14:03,636 --> 00:14:09,0
 flocks, and their herds, and their grain, and all

141
00:14:09,0 --> 00:14:14,364
 their substance, and did march forth by thousands and

142
00:14:14,364 --> 00:14:19,728
 by tens of thousands, until they had all gone

143
00:14:19,728 --> 00:14:25,092
 forth to the place which had been appointed that they

144
00:14:25,092 --> 00:14:30,456
 should gather themselves together, to defend

145
00:14:30,456 --> 00:14:35,82
 themselves against their enemies

146
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:41,208
23 And the land which was appointed was the land

147
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:47,208
 of Zarahemla, and the land which was between the

148
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:53,208
 land Zarahemla and the land Bountiful, yea, to the

149
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:59,208
 line which was between the land Bountiful and the

150
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:05,208
 land Desolation

151
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:10,838
24 And there were a great many thousand people who

152
00:15:10,838 --> 00:15:16,005
 were called Nephites, who did gather themselves

153
00:15:16,005 --> 00:15:21,172
 together in this land. Now Lachoneus did cause that

154
00:15:21,172 --> 00:15:26,339
 they should gather themselves together in the

155
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:31,506
 land southward, because of the great curse which was

156
00:15:31,506 --> 00:15:36,673
 upon the land northward

157
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:42,01
25 And they did fortify themselves against their

158
00:15:42,01 --> 00:15:47,885
 enemies; and they did dwell in one land, and in one

159
00:15:47,885 --> 00:15:53,76
 body, and they did fear the words which had been

160
00:15:53,76 --> 00:15:59,635
 spoken by Lachoneus, insomuch that they did repent

161
00:15:59,635 --> 00:16:05,51
 of all their sins; and they did put up their

162
00:16:05,51 --> 00:16:11,385
 prayers unto the Lord their God, that he would deliver

163
00:16:11,385 --> 00:16:17,26
 them in the time that their enemies should come

164
00:16:17,26 --> 00:16:23,135
 down against them to battle

165
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:26,348
26 And they were exceedingly sorrowful because of

166
00:16:26,348 --> 00:16:29,681
 their enemies. And Gidgiddoni did cause that they

167
00:16:29,681 --> 00:16:33,014
 should make weapons of war of every kind, and they

168
00:16:33,014 --> 00:16:36,347
 should be strong with armor, and with shields,

169
00:16:36,347 --> 00:16:39,68
 and with bucklers, after the manner of his

170
00:16:39,68 --> 00:16:43,013
 instruction.
