00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 3 Giddianhi, the Gadianton leader,

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
demands that Lachoneus and the Nephites

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
surrender themselves and their lands—Lachoneus

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
appoints Gidgiddoni as chief captain of the

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
armies—The Nephites assemble in Zarahemla and

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:10:39,
Bountiful to defend themselves. About A.D. 16–18. 

7
00:10:39,0 --> 00:10:39,0
1 And now it came to pass that in the

8
00:10:39,0 --> 00:10:39,0
sixteenth year from the coming of Christ,

9
00:10:39,0 --> 00:10:39,0
Lachoneus, the governor of the land,

10
00:10:39,0 --> 00:10:39,0
received an epistle from the leader and the

11
00:10:39,0 --> 00:10:39,0
governor of this band of robbers; and these

12
00:10:39,0 --> 00:25:45,
were the words which were written, saying:

13
00:25:45,0 --> 00:25:45,0
2 Lachoneus, most noble and chief

14
00:25:45,0 --> 00:25:45,0
governor of the land, behold, I write this

15
00:25:45,0 --> 00:25:45,0
epistle unto you, and do give unto you

16
00:25:45,0 --> 00:25:45,0
exceedingly great praise because of your

17
00:25:45,0 --> 00:25:45,0
firmness, and also the firmness of

18
00:25:45,0 --> 00:25:45,0
your people, in maintaining that which ye

19
00:25:45,0 --> 00:25:45,0
suppose to be your right and liberty;

20
00:25:45,0 --> 00:25:45,0
yea, ye do stand well, as if ye were

21
00:25:45,0 --> 00:25:45,0
supported by the hand of a god, in the

22
00:25:45,0 --> 00:25:45,0
defence of your liberty, and your

23
00:25:45,0 --> 00:25:17,
property, and your country, or that which ye do call so.

24
00:25:17,0 --> 00:25:17,0
3 And it seemeth a pity unto me, most

25
00:25:17,0 --> 00:25:17,0
noble Lachoneus, that ye should be so

26
00:25:17,0 --> 00:25:17,0
foolish and vain as to suppose that ye

27
00:25:17,0 --> 00:25:17,0
can stand against so many brave men

28
00:25:17,0 --> 00:25:17,0
who are at my command, who do now at

29
00:25:17,0 --> 00:25:17,0
this time stand in their arms, and do

30
00:25:17,0 --> 00:25:17,0
await with great anxiety for the word—Go

31
00:25:17,0 --> 00:26:29,
down upon the Nephites and destroy them.

32
00:26:29,0 --> 00:26:29,0
4 And I, knowing of their

33
00:26:29,0 --> 00:26:29,0
unconquerable spirit, having proved them in

34
00:26:29,0 --> 00:26:29,0
the field of battle, and knowing of

35
00:26:29,0 --> 00:26:29,0
their everlasting hatred towards you

36
00:26:29,0 --> 00:26:29,0
because of the many wrongs which ye

37
00:26:29,0 --> 00:26:29,0
have done unto them, therefore if

38
00:26:29,0 --> 00:26:29,0
they should come down against you they

39
00:26:29,0 --> 00:26:01,
would visit you with utter destruction.

40
00:26:01,0 --> 00:26:01,0
5 Therefore I have written this

41
00:26:01,0 --> 00:26:01,0
epistle, sealing it with mine own

42
00:26:01,0 --> 00:26:01,0
hand, feeling for your welfare,

43
00:26:01,0 --> 00:26:01,0
because of your firmness in that which

44
00:26:01,0 --> 00:26:01,0
ye believe to be right, and your

45
00:26:01,0 --> 00:25:33,
noble spirit in the field of battle.

46
00:25:33,0 --> 00:25:33,0
6 Therefore I write unto you,

47
00:25:33,0 --> 00:25:33,0
desiring that ye would yield up

48
00:25:33,0 --> 00:25:33,0
unto this my people, your cities,

49
00:25:33,0 --> 00:25:33,0
your lands, and your

50
00:25:33,0 --> 00:25:33,0
possessions, rather than that they should

51
00:25:33,0 --> 00:25:33,0
visit you with the sword and that

52
00:25:33,0 --> 00:25:05,
destruction should come upon you.

53
00:25:05,0 --> 00:25:05,0
7 Or in other words, yield

54
00:25:05,0 --> 00:25:05,0
yourselves up unto us, and

55
00:25:05,0 --> 00:25:05,0
unite with us and become

56
00:25:05,0 --> 00:25:05,0
acquainted with our secret works, and

57
00:25:05,0 --> 00:25:05,0
become our brethren that ye

58
00:25:05,0 --> 00:25:05,0
may be like unto us—not our

59
00:25:05,0 --> 00:25:05,0
slaves, but our brethren and

60
00:25:05,0 --> 00:24:37,
partners of all our substance.

61
00:24:37,0 --> 00:24:37,0
8 And behold, I swear unto

62
00:24:37,0 --> 00:24:37,0
you, if ye will do this,

63
00:24:37,0 --> 00:24:37,0
with an oath, ye shall not be

64
00:24:37,0 --> 00:24:37,0
destroyed; but if ye will

65
00:24:37,0 --> 00:24:37,0
not do this, I swear unto

66
00:24:37,0 --> 00:24:37,0
you with an oath, that on

67
00:24:37,0 --> 00:24:37,0
the morrow month I will

68
00:24:37,0 --> 00:24:37,0
command that my armies shall

69
00:24:37,0 --> 00:24:37,0
come down against you, and

70
00:24:37,0 --> 00:24:37,0
they shall not stay their hand

71
00:24:37,0 --> 00:24:37,0
and shall spare not, but

72
00:24:37,0 --> 00:24:37,0
shall slay you, and shall

73
00:24:37,0 --> 00:24:37,0
let fall the sword upon you

74
00:24:37,0 --> 00:26:49,
even until ye shall become extinct.

75
00:26:49,0 --> 00:26:49,0
9 And behold, I am

76
00:26:49,0 --> 00:26:49,0
Giddianhi; and I am the governor of

77
00:26:49,0 --> 00:26:49,0
this the secret society of

78
00:26:49,0 --> 00:26:49,0
Gadianton; which society

79
00:26:49,0 --> 00:26:49,0
and the works thereof I know

80
00:26:49,0 --> 00:26:49,0
to be good; and they are

81
00:26:49,0 --> 00:26:49,0
of ancient date and they

82
00:26:49,0 --> 00:26:21,
have been handed down unto us.

83
00:26:21,0 --> 00:26:21,0
10 And I write this

84
00:26:21,0 --> 00:26:21,0
epistle unto you, Lachoneus,

85
00:26:21,0 --> 00:26:21,0
and I hope that ye will

86
00:26:21,0 --> 00:26:21,0
deliver up your lands and

87
00:26:21,0 --> 00:26:21,0
your possessions, without

88
00:26:21,0 --> 00:26:21,0
the shedding of blood,

89
00:26:21,0 --> 00:26:21,0
that this my people may

90
00:26:21,0 --> 00:26:21,0
recover their rights and

91
00:26:21,0 --> 00:26:21,0
government, who have

92
00:26:21,0 --> 00:26:21,0
dissented away from you because

93
00:26:21,0 --> 00:26:21,0
of your wickedness in

94
00:26:21,0 --> 00:26:21,0
retaining from them their

95
00:26:21,0 --> 00:26:21,0
rights of government, and

96
00:26:21,0 --> 00:26:21,0
except ye do this, I will

97
00:26:21,0 --> 00:30:34,
avenge their wrongs. I am Giddianhi.

98
00:30:34,0 --> 00:30:34,0
11 And now it came to

99
00:30:34,0 --> 00:30:34,0
pass when Lachoneus

100
00:30:34,0 --> 00:30:34,0
received this epistle he

101
00:30:34,0 --> 00:30:34,0
was exceedingly

102
00:30:34,0 --> 00:30:34,0
astonished, because of the

103
00:30:34,0 --> 00:30:34,0
boldness of Giddianhi

104
00:30:34,0 --> 00:30:34,0
demanding the possession of

105
00:30:34,0 --> 00:30:34,0
the land of the

106
00:30:34,0 --> 00:30:34,0
Nephites, and also of

107
00:30:34,0 --> 00:30:34,0
threatening the people and

108
00:30:34,0 --> 00:30:34,0
avenging the wrongs of those

109
00:30:34,0 --> 00:30:34,0
that had received no

110
00:30:34,0 --> 00:30:34,0
wrong, save it were they

111
00:30:34,0 --> 00:30:34,0
had wronged themselves

112
00:30:34,0 --> 00:30:34,0
by dissenting away

113
00:30:34,0 --> 00:32:46,
unto those wicked and abominable robbers.

114
00:32:46,0 --> 00:32:46,0
12 Now behold, this

115
00:32:46,0 --> 00:32:46,0
Lachoneus, the governor,

116
00:32:46,0 --> 00:32:46,0
was a just man, and

117
00:32:46,0 --> 00:32:46,0
could not be frightened

118
00:32:46,0 --> 00:32:46,0
by the demands and

119
00:32:46,0 --> 00:32:46,0
the threatenings of a

120
00:32:46,0 --> 00:32:46,0
robber; therefore he did

121
00:32:46,0 --> 00:32:46,0
not hearken to the

122
00:32:46,0 --> 00:32:46,0
epistle of Giddianhi,

123
00:32:46,0 --> 00:32:46,0
the governor of the

124
00:32:46,0 --> 00:32:46,0
robbers, but he did cause

125
00:32:46,0 --> 00:32:46,0
that his people should

126
00:32:46,0 --> 00:32:46,0
cry unto the Lord for

127
00:32:46,0 --> 00:32:46,0
strength against the

128
00:32:46,0 --> 00:32:46,0
time that the robbers

129
00:32:46,0 --> 00:32:18,
should come down against them.

130
00:32:18,0 --> 00:32:18,0
13 Yea, he sent a

131
00:32:18,0 --> 00:32:18,0
proclamation among all

132
00:32:18,0 --> 00:32:18,0
the people, that they

133
00:32:18,0 --> 00:32:18,0
should gather

134
00:32:18,0 --> 00:32:18,0
together their women, and

135
00:32:18,0 --> 00:32:18,0
their children, their

136
00:32:18,0 --> 00:32:18,0
flocks and their

137
00:32:18,0 --> 00:32:18,0
herds, and all their

138
00:32:18,0 --> 00:32:18,0
substance, save it were

139
00:32:18,0 --> 00:36:46,
their land, unto one place.

140
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
14 And he caused

141
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
that fortifications

142
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
should be built round

143
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
about them, and the

144
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
strength thereof

145
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
should be exceedingly

146
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
great. And he caused

147
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
that armies, both of

148
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
the Nephites and of

149
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
the Lamanites, or of

150
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
all them who were

151
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
numbered among the

152
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
Nephites, should be

153
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
placed as guards round

154
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
about to watch

155
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:46,0
them, and to guard them

156
00:36:46,0 --> 00:36:18,
from the robbers day and night.

157
00:36:18,0 --> 00:36:18,0
15 Yea, he said

158
00:36:18,0 --> 00:36:18,0
unto them: As the

159
00:36:18,0 --> 00:36:18,0
Lord liveth, except

160
00:36:18,0 --> 00:36:18,0
ye repent of all

161
00:36:18,0 --> 00:36:18,0
your iniquities,

162
00:36:18,0 --> 00:36:18,0
and cry unto the

163
00:36:18,0 --> 00:36:18,0
Lord, ye will in

164
00:36:18,0 --> 00:36:18,0
nowise be delivered

165
00:36:18,0 --> 00:36:18,0
out of the hands of

166
00:36:18,0 --> 00:36:48,
those Gadianton robbers.

167
00:36:48,0 --> 00:36:48,0
16 And so great

168
00:36:48,0 --> 00:36:48,0
and marvelous were

169
00:36:48,0 --> 00:36:48,0
the words and

170
00:36:48,0 --> 00:36:48,0
prophecies of

171
00:36:48,0 --> 00:36:48,0
Lachoneus that they

172
00:36:48,0 --> 00:36:48,0
did cause fear to

173
00:36:48,0 --> 00:36:48,0
come upon all the

174
00:36:48,0 --> 00:36:48,0
people; and they

175
00:36:48,0 --> 00:36:48,0
did exert

176
00:36:48,0 --> 00:36:48,0
themselves in their

177
00:36:48,0 --> 00:36:48,0
might to do according

178
00:36:48,0 --> 00:36:20,
to the words of Lachoneus.

179
00:36:20,0 --> 00:36:20,0
17 And it came

180
00:36:20,0 --> 00:36:20,0
to pass that

181
00:36:20,0 --> 00:36:20,0
Lachoneus did

182
00:36:20,0 --> 00:36:20,0
appoint chief captains

183
00:36:20,0 --> 00:36:20,0
over all the

184
00:36:20,0 --> 00:36:20,0
armies of the

185
00:36:20,0 --> 00:36:20,0
Nephites, to command

186
00:36:20,0 --> 00:36:20,0
them at the

187
00:36:20,0 --> 00:36:20,0
time that the

188
00:36:20,0 --> 00:36:20,0
robbers should come

189
00:36:20,0 --> 00:36:20,0
down out of the

190
00:36:20,0 --> 00:37:18,
wilderness against them.

191
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
18 Now the

192
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
chiefest among all

193
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
the chief

194
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
captains and the

195
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
great commander of

196
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
all the armies

197
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
of the

198
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
Nephites was

199
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
appointed, and his name

200
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,
was Gidgiddoni.

201
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
19 Now it was

202
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
the custom

203
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
among all the

204
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
Nephites to

205
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
appoint for their

206
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
chief captains,

207
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
(save it were

208
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
in their

209
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
times of

210
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
wickedness) some one

211
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
that had the

212
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
spirit of

213
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
revelation and also

214
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
prophecy;

215
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
therefore, this

216
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
Gidgiddoni was a

217
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
great prophet

218
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
among them, as

219
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,
also was the chief judge.

220
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
20 Now the

221
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
people said

222
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
unto Gidgiddoni:

223
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
Pray unto

224
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
the Lord, and

225
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
let us go up

226
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
upon the

227
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
mountains and into

228
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
the

229
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
wilderness, that we

230
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
may fall upon

231
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
the robbers

232
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
and destroy

233
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,
them in their own lands.

234
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
21 But

235
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
Gidgiddoni saith

236
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
unto them: The

237
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
Lord forbid;

238
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
for if we

239
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
should go up

240
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
against them the

241
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
Lord would

242
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
deliver us

243
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
into their

244
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
hands; therefore

245
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
we will

246
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
prepare ourselves

247
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
in the center

248
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
of our lands,

249
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
and we will

250
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
gather all

251
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
our armies

252
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
together, and we

253
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
will not go

254
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
against them,

255
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
but we will

256
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
wait till they

257
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
shall come

258
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
against us;

259
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
therefore as

260
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
the Lord

261
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
liveth, if we do

262
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
this he will

263
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
deliver them

264
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,
into our hands.

265
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
22 And it

266
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
came to pass

267
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
in the

268
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
seventeenth year,

269
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
in the

270
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
latter end of the

271
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
year, the

272
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
proclamation

273
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
of Lachoneus

274
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
had gone

275
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
forth

276
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
throughout all the

277
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
face of the

278
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
land, and

279
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
they had taken

280
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
their

281
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
horses, and their

282
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
chariots,

283
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
and their

284
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
cattle, and all

285
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
their

286
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
flocks, and their

287
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
herds, and

288
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
their grain,

289
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
and all

290
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
their substance,

291
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
and did

292
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
march forth by

293
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
thousands

294
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
and by tens of

295
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
thousands,

296
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
until they

297
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
had all gone

298
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
forth to the

299
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
place which

300
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
had been

301
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
appointed that

302
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
they should

303
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
gather

304
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
themselves

305
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,
together, to defend themselves against their enemies.

306
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
23 And the

307
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
land which

308
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
was

309
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
appointed was the

310
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
land of

311
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
Zarahemla, and

312
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
the land

313
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
which was

314
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
between the

315
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
land

316
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
Zarahemla and the

317
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
land

318
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
Bountiful, yea,

319
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
to the line

320
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
which was

321
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
between the

322
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
land

323
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,
Bountiful and the land Desolation.

324
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
24 And

325
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
there were a

326
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
great many

327
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
thousand

328
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
people who

329
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
were

330
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
called

331
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
Nephites, who did

332
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
gather

333
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
themselves

334
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
together in

335
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
this

336
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
land. Now

337
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
Lachoneus did

338
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
cause that

339
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
they

340
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
should gather

341
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
themselves

342
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
together

343
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
in the

344
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
land

345
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
southward, because

346
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
of the

347
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
great curse

348
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,
which was upon the land northward.

349
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
25 And

350
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
they did

351
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
fortify

352
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
themselves

353
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
against

354
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
their

355
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
enemies; and

356
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
they did

357
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
dwell in

358
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
one land,

359
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
and in

00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
one body,

361
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
and they

362
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
did fear

363
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
the words

364
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
which had

365
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
been

366
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
spoken by

367
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
Lachoneus,

368
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
insomuch

369
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
that they

370
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
did

371
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
repent of all

372
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
their

373
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
sins; and

374
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
they did

375
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
put up

376
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
their

377
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
prayers unto

378
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
the Lord

379
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
their God,

380
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
that he

381
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
would

382
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
deliver them

383
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
in the

384
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
time that

385
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
their

386
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,
enemies should come down against them to battle.

387
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
26 And

388
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
they were

389
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0


390
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
exceedingly

391
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
sorrowful

392
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
because

393
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
of their

394
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
enemies.

395
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
And

396
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
Gidgiddoni

397
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
did

398
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
cause that

399
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
they

400
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
should make

405
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
and they

406
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
should be

strong

408
00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
with

00:37:18,0 --> 00:37:18,0
after
