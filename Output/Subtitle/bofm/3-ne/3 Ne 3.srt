00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:07,667
Chapter 3 Giddianhi, the Gadianton leader,

2
00:00:07,667 --> 00:00:15,334
demands that Lachoneus and the Nephites

3
00:00:15,334 --> 00:00:23,001
surrender themselves and their lands—Lachoneus

4
00:00:23,001 --> 00:00:30,668
appoints Gidgiddoni as chief captain of the

5
00:00:30,668 --> 00:00:38,335
armies—The Nephites assemble in Zarahemla and

6
00:00:38,335 --> 00:00:46,179
Bountiful to defend themselves. About A.D. 16–18. 

7
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:47,012
1 And now it came to pass that in the

8
00:00:47,012 --> 00:00:47,845
sixteenth year from the coming of Christ,

9
00:00:47,845 --> 00:00:48,678
Lachoneus, the governor of the land,

10
00:00:48,678 --> 00:00:49,511
received an epistle from the leader and the

11
00:00:49,511 --> 00:00:50,344
governor of this band of robbers; and these

12
00:00:50,344 --> 00:00:51,585
were the words which were written, saying:

13
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:51,494
2 Lachoneus, most noble and chief

14
00:00:51,494 --> 00:00:51,403
governor of the land, behold, I write this

15
00:00:51,403 --> 00:00:51,312
epistle unto you, and do give unto you

16
00:00:51,312 --> 00:00:51,221
exceedingly great praise because of your

17
00:00:51,221 --> 00:00:51,13
firmness, and also the firmness of

18
00:00:51,13 --> 00:00:51,039
your people, in maintaining that which ye

19
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:50,948
suppose to be your right and liberty;

20
00:00:50,948 --> 00:00:50,857
yea, ye do stand well, as if ye were

21
00:00:50,857 --> 00:00:50,766
supported by the hand of a god, in the

22
00:00:50,766 --> 00:00:50,675
defence of your liberty, and your

23
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:50,651
property, and your country, or that which ye do call so.

24
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:51,026
3 And it seemeth a pity unto me, most

25
00:00:51,026 --> 00:00:51,401
noble Lachoneus, that ye should be so

26
00:00:51,401 --> 00:00:51,776
foolish and vain as to suppose that ye

27
00:00:51,776 --> 00:00:52,151
can stand against so many brave men

28
00:00:52,151 --> 00:00:52,526
who are at my command, who do now at

29
00:00:52,526 --> 00:00:52,901
this time stand in their arms, and do

30
00:00:52,901 --> 00:00:53,276
await with great anxiety for the word—Go

31
00:00:53,276 --> 00:00:53,053
down upon the Nephites and destroy them.

32
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:52,928
4 And I, knowing of their

33
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:52,803
unconquerable spirit, having proved them in

34
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:52,678
the field of battle, and knowing of

35
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:52,553
their everlasting hatred towards you

36
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:52,428
because of the many wrongs which ye

37
00:00:52,428 --> 00:00:52,303
have done unto them, therefore if

38
00:00:52,303 --> 00:00:52,178
they should come down against you they

39
00:00:52,178 --> 00:00:52,119
would visit you with utter destruction.

40
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:54,619
5 Therefore I have written this

41
00:00:54,619 --> 00:00:57,119
epistle, sealing it with mine own

42
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:59,619
hand, feeling for your welfare,

43
00:00:59,619 --> 00:01:02,119
because of your firmness in that which

44
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:04,619
ye believe to be right, and your

45
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:07,1
noble spirit in the field of battle.

46
00:01:07,1 --> 00:01:07,671
6 Therefore I write unto you,

47
00:01:07,671 --> 00:01:08,242
desiring that ye would yield up

48
00:01:08,242 --> 00:01:08,813
unto this my people, your cities,

49
00:01:08,813 --> 00:01:09,384
your lands, and your

50
00:01:09,384 --> 00:01:09,955
possessions, rather than that they should

51
00:01:09,955 --> 00:01:10,526
visit you with the sword and that

52
00:01:10,526 --> 00:01:11,505
destruction should come upon you.

53
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
7 Or in other words, yield

54
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
yourselves up unto us, and

55
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
unite with us and become

56
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
acquainted with our secret works, and

57
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
become our brethren that ye

58
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
may be like unto us—not our

59
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
slaves, but our brethren and

60
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,972
partners of all our substance.

61
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
8 And behold, I swear unto

62
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
you, if ye will do this,

63
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
with an oath, ye shall not be

64
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
destroyed; but if ye will

65
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
not do this, I swear unto

66
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
you with an oath, that on

67
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
the morrow month I will

68
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
command that my armies shall

69
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
come down against you, and

70
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
they shall not stay their hand

71
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
and shall spare not, but

72
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
shall slay you, and shall

73
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
let fall the sword upon you

74
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,505
even until ye shall become extinct.

75
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
9 And behold, I am

76
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
Giddianhi; and I am the governor of

77
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
this the secret society of

78
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
Gadianton; which society

79
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
and the works thereof I know

80
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
to be good; and they are

81
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
of ancient date and they

82
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,972
have been handed down unto us.

83
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
10 And I write this

84
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
epistle unto you, Lachoneus,

85
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
and I hope that ye will

86
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
deliver up your lands and

87
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
your possessions, without

88
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
the shedding of blood,

89
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
that this my people may

90
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
recover their rights and

91
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
government, who have

92
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
dissented away from you because

93
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
of your wickedness in

94
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
retaining from them their

95
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
rights of government, and

96
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
except ye do this, I will

97
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,505
avenge their wrongs. I am Giddianhi.

98
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
11 And now it came to

99
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
pass when Lachoneus

100
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
received this epistle he

101
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
was exceedingly

102
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
astonished, because of the

103
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
boldness of Giddianhi

104
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
demanding the possession of

105
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
the land of the

106
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
Nephites, and also of

107
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
threatening the people and

108
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
avenging the wrongs of those

109
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
that had received no

110
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
wrong, save it were they

111
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
had wronged themselves

112
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
by dissenting away

113
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,972
unto those wicked and abominable robbers.

114
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
12 Now behold, this

115
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
Lachoneus, the governor,

116
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
was a just man, and

117
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
could not be frightened

118
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
by the demands and

119
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
the threatenings of a

120
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
robber; therefore he did

121
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
not hearken to the

122
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
epistle of Giddianhi,

123
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
the governor of the

124
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
robbers, but he did cause

125
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
that his people should

126
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
cry unto the Lord for

127
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
strength against the

128
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
time that the robbers

129
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,505
should come down against them.

130
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
13 Yea, he sent a

131
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
proclamation among all

132
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
the people, that they

133
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
should gather

134
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
together their women, and

135
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
their children, their

136
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
flocks and their

137
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
herds, and all their

138
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
substance, save it were

139
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,972
their land, unto one place.

140
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
14 And he caused

141
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
that fortifications

142
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
should be built round

143
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
about them, and the

144
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
strength thereof

145
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
should be exceedingly

146
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
great. And he caused

147
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
that armies, both of

148
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
the Nephites and of

149
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
the Lamanites, or of

150
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
all them who were

151
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
numbered among the

152
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
Nephites, should be

153
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
placed as guards round

154
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
about to watch

155
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
them, and to guard them

156
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,505
from the robbers day and night.

157
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
15 Yea, he said

158
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
unto them: As the

159
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
Lord liveth, except

160
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
ye repent of all

161
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
your iniquities,

162
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
and cry unto the

163
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
Lord, ye will in

164
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
nowise be delivered

165
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
out of the hands of

166
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,972
those Gadianton robbers.

167
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
16 And so great

168
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
and marvelous were

169
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
the words and

170
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
prophecies of

171
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
Lachoneus that they

172
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
did cause fear to

173
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
come upon all the

174
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
people; and they

175
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
did exert

176
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
themselves in their

177
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
might to do according

178
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,505
to the words of Lachoneus.

179
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
17 And it came

180
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
to pass that

181
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
Lachoneus did

182
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
appoint chief captains

183
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
over all the

184
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
armies of the

185
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
Nephites, to command

186
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
them at the

187
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
time that the

188
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
robbers should come

189
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
down out of the

190
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,972
wilderness against them.

191
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
18 Now the

192
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
chiefest among all

193
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
the chief

194
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
captains and the

195
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
great commander of

196
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
all the armies

197
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
of the

198
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
Nephites was

199
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
appointed, and his name

200
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,505
was Gidgiddoni.

201
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
19 Now it was

202
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
the custom

203
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
among all the

204
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
Nephites to

205
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
appoint for their

206
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
chief captains,

207
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
(save it were

208
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
in their

209
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
times of

210
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
wickedness) some one

211
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
that had the

212
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
spirit of

213
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
revelation and also

214
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
prophecy;

215
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
therefore, this

216
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
Gidgiddoni was a

217
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
great prophet

218
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
among them, as

219
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,972
also was the chief judge.

220
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
20 Now the

221
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
people said

222
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
unto Gidgiddoni:

223
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
Pray unto

224
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
the Lord, and

225
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
let us go up

226
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
upon the

227
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
mountains and into

228
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
the

229
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
wilderness, that we

230
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
may fall upon

231
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
the robbers

232
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
and destroy

233
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,505
them in their own lands.

234
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
21 But

235
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
Gidgiddoni saith

236
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
unto them: The

237
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
Lord forbid;

238
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
for if we

239
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
should go up

240
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
against them the

241
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
Lord would

242
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
deliver us

243
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
into their

244
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
hands; therefore

245
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
we will

246
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
prepare ourselves

247
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
in the center

248
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
of our lands,

249
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
and we will

250
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
gather all

251
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
our armies

252
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
together, and we

253
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
will not go

254
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
against them,

255
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
but we will

256
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
wait till they

257
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
shall come

258
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
against us;

259
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
therefore as

260
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
the Lord

261
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
liveth, if we do

262
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
this he will

263
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
deliver them

264
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,972
into our hands.

265
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
22 And it

266
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
came to pass

267
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
in the

268
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
seventeenth year,

269
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
in the

270
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
latter end of the

271
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
year, the

272
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
proclamation

273
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972

throughout all the

279
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
they had taken

280
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972

283
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
and their

284
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972

285
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
their

and all

290
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
their substance,

291
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
and did

292
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
march forth by

294
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
and by tens of

00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
thousands,

296
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
until they

297
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972

298
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
forth to the

299
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
place which

300
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972

00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
appointed that

302
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
they should

303
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972

together, to defend themselves against their enemies.

306
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
23 And the

307
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
land which

308
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505

Zarahemla, and

312
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
the land

313
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
which was

314
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
between the

315
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505

00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
between the

Bountiful and the land Desolation.

324
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
24 And

325
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
there were a

326
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
great many

327
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
thousand

328
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
people who

329
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
were

330
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
called

331
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
Nephites, who did

332
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
gather

333
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
themselves

334
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
together in

335
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
this

336
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
land. Now

337
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
Lachoneus did

338
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
cause that

339
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
they

340
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
should gather

341
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
themselves

342
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
together

343
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
in the

344
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
land

345
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
southward, because

346
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
of the

347
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
great curse

348
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,505
which was upon the land northward.

349
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
25 And

350
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
they did

351
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
fortify

352
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
themselves

353
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
against

354
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
their

355
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
enemies; and

356
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
they did

357
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
dwell in

358
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
one land,

359
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
and in

360
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
one body,

361
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
and they

362
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
did fear

363
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
the words

364
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
which had

365
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
been

366
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
spoken by

367
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
Lachoneus,

368
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
insomuch

369
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
that they

370
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
did

371
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
repent of all

372
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
their

373
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
sins; and

374
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
they did

375
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
put up

376
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
their

377
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
prayers unto

378
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
the Lord

379
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
their God,

380
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
that he

381
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
would

382
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
deliver them

383
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
in the

384
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
time that

385
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,505
their

386
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:11,972
enemies should come down against them to battle.

387
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
26 And

388
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
they were

389
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972


390
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
exceedingly

391
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
sorrowful

392
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
because

393
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
of their

394
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
enemies.

395
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
And

396
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
Gidgiddoni

397
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
did

398
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:11,972
