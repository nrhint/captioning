1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 27 Jesus commands them to call the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Church in His name—His mission and atoning

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
sacrifice constitute His gospel—Men are

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
commanded to repent and be baptized that they

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
may be sanctified by the Holy Ghost—They

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:10:10,
are to be even as Jesus is. About A.D. 34–35. 

7
00:10:10,0 --> 00:10:10,0
1 And it came to pass that as the

8
00:10:10,0 --> 00:10:10,0
disciples of Jesus were journeying and were

9
00:10:10,0 --> 00:10:10,0
preaching the things which they had

10
00:10:10,0 --> 00:10:10,0
both heard and seen, and were baptizing in

11
00:10:10,0 --> 00:10:10,0
the name of Jesus, it came to pass

12
00:10:10,0 --> 00:10:10,0
that the disciples were gathered together

13
00:10:10,0 --> 00:09:42,
and were united in mighty prayer and fasting.

14
00:09:42,0 --> 00:09:42,0
2 And Jesus again showed himself

15
00:09:42,0 --> 00:09:42,0
unto them, for they were praying

16
00:09:42,0 --> 00:09:42,0
unto the Father in his name; and

17
00:09:42,0 --> 00:09:42,0
Jesus came and stood in the midst

18
00:09:42,0 --> 00:09:42,0
of them, and said unto them:

19
00:09:42,0 --> 00:09:14,
What will ye that I shall give unto you?

20
00:09:14,0 --> 00:09:14,0
3 And they said unto him:

21
00:09:14,0 --> 00:09:14,0
Lord, we will that thou wouldst

22
00:09:14,0 --> 00:09:14,0
tell us the name whereby we

23
00:09:14,0 --> 00:09:14,0
shall call this church; for

24
00:09:14,0 --> 00:09:14,0
there are disputations among

25
00:09:14,0 --> 00:20:21,
the people concerning this matter.

26
00:20:21,0 --> 00:20:21,0
4 And the Lord said unto

27
00:20:21,0 --> 00:20:21,0
them: Verily, verily, I say

28
00:20:21,0 --> 00:20:21,0
unto you, why is it that the

29
00:20:21,0 --> 00:20:21,0
people should murmur and

30
00:20:21,0 --> 00:22:33,
dispute because of this thing?

31
00:22:33,0 --> 00:22:33,0
5 Have they not read the

32
00:22:33,0 --> 00:22:33,0
scriptures, which say ye

33
00:22:33,0 --> 00:22:33,0
must take upon you the name

34
00:22:33,0 --> 00:22:33,0
of Christ, which is my

35
00:22:33,0 --> 00:22:33,0
name? For by this name shall

36
00:22:33,0 --> 00:27:43,
ye be called at the last day;

37
00:27:43,0 --> 00:27:43,0
6 And whoso taketh upon

38
00:27:43,0 --> 00:27:43,0
him my name, and endureth

39
00:27:43,0 --> 00:27:43,0
to the end, the same

40
00:27:43,0 --> 00:35:55,
shall be saved at the last day.

41
00:35:55,0 --> 00:35:55,0
7 Therefore, whatsoever

42
00:35:55,0 --> 00:35:55,0
ye shall do, ye shall do

43
00:35:55,0 --> 00:35:55,0
it in my name;

44
00:35:55,0 --> 00:35:55,0
therefore ye shall call the

45
00:35:55,0 --> 00:35:55,0
church in my name; and ye

46
00:35:55,0 --> 00:35:55,0
shall call upon the Father

47
00:35:55,0 --> 00:35:55,0
in my name that he will

48
00:35:55,0 --> 00:47:24,
bless the church for my sake.

49
00:47:24,0 --> 00:47:24,0
8 And how be it my

50
00:47:24,0 --> 00:47:24,0
church save it be called

51
00:47:24,0 --> 00:47:24,0
in my name? For if a

52
00:47:24,0 --> 00:47:24,0
church be called in

53
00:47:24,0 --> 00:47:24,0
Moses’ name then it be

54
00:47:24,0 --> 00:47:24,0
Moses’ church; or if it

55
00:47:24,0 --> 00:47:24,0
be called in the name

56
00:47:24,0 --> 00:47:24,0
of a man then it be

57
00:47:24,0 --> 00:47:24,0
the church of a man; but

58
00:47:24,0 --> 00:47:24,0
if it be called in my

59
00:47:24,0 --> 00:47:24,0
name then it is my

60
00:47:24,0 --> 00:47:24,0
church, if it so be that

61
00:47:24,0 --> 00:55:08,
they are built upon my gospel.

62
00:55:08,0 --> 00:55:08,0
9 Verily I say unto

63
00:55:08,0 --> 00:55:08,0
you, that ye are

64
00:55:08,0 --> 00:55:08,0
built upon my gospel;

65
00:55:08,0 --> 00:55:08,0
therefore ye shall

66
00:55:08,0 --> 00:55:08,0
call whatsoever things

67
00:55:08,0 --> 00:55:08,0
ye do call, in my

68
00:55:08,0 --> 00:55:08,0
name; therefore if ye

69
00:55:08,0 --> 00:55:08,0
call upon the

70
00:55:08,0 --> 00:55:08,0
Father, for the church,

71
00:55:08,0 --> 00:55:08,0
if it be in my name

72
00:55:08,0 --> 01:03:20,
the Father will hear you;

73
01:03:20,0 --> 01:03:20,0
10 And if it so be

74
01:03:20,0 --> 01:03:20,0
that the church

75
01:03:20,0 --> 01:03:20,0
is built upon my

76
01:03:20,0 --> 01:03:20,0
gospel then will the

77
01:03:20,0 --> 01:03:20,0
Father show forth

78
01:03:20,0 --> 01:02:52,
his own works in it.

79
01:02:52,0 --> 01:02:52,0
11 But if it be

80
01:02:52,0 --> 01:02:52,0
not built upon my

81
01:02:52,0 --> 01:02:52,0
gospel, and is

82
01:02:52,0 --> 01:02:52,0
built upon the

83
01:02:52,0 --> 01:02:52,0
works of men, or upon

84
01:02:52,0 --> 01:02:52,0
the works of the

85
01:02:52,0 --> 01:02:52,0
devil, verily I

86
01:02:52,0 --> 01:02:52,0
say unto you they

87
01:02:52,0 --> 01:02:52,0
have joy in

88
01:02:52,0 --> 01:02:52,0
their works for a

89
01:02:52,0 --> 01:02:52,0
season, and by and

90
01:02:52,0 --> 01:02:52,0
by the end cometh,

91
01:02:52,0 --> 01:02:52,0
and they are

92
01:02:52,0 --> 01:02:52,0
hewn down and cast

93
01:02:52,0 --> 01:02:52,0
into the fire,

94
01:02:52,0 --> 01:13:02,
from whence there is no return.

95
01:13:02,0 --> 01:13:02,0
12 For their

96
01:13:02,0 --> 01:13:02,0
works do follow

97
01:13:02,0 --> 01:13:02,0
them, for it is

98
01:13:02,0 --> 01:13:02,0
because of their

99
01:13:02,0 --> 01:13:02,0
works that they

100
01:13:02,0 --> 01:13:02,0
are hewn down;

101
01:13:02,0 --> 01:13:02,0
therefore remember

102
01:13:02,0 --> 01:13:02,0
the things that

103
01:13:02,0 --> 01:19:43,
I have told you.

104
01:19:43,0 --> 01:19:43,0
13 Behold I have

105
01:19:43,0 --> 01:19:43,0
given unto you

106
01:19:43,0 --> 01:19:43,0
my gospel, and

107
01:19:43,0 --> 01:19:43,0
this is the

108
01:19:43,0 --> 01:19:43,0
gospel which I have

109
01:19:43,0 --> 01:19:43,0
given unto

110
01:19:43,0 --> 01:19:43,0
you—that I came into

111
01:19:43,0 --> 01:19:43,0
the world to do

112
01:19:43,0 --> 01:19:43,0
the will of my

113
01:19:43,0 --> 01:19:43,0
Father, because my

114
01:19:43,0 --> 01:32:52,
Father sent me.

115
01:32:52,0 --> 01:32:52,0
14 And my

116
01:32:52,0 --> 01:32:52,0
Father sent me that

117
01:32:52,0 --> 01:32:52,0
I might be

118
01:32:52,0 --> 01:32:52,0
lifted up upon the

119
01:32:52,0 --> 01:32:52,0
cross; and

120
01:32:52,0 --> 01:32:52,0
after that I had

121
01:32:52,0 --> 01:32:52,0
been lifted up

122
01:32:52,0 --> 01:32:52,0
upon the cross,

123
01:32:52,0 --> 01:32:52,0
that I might

124
01:32:52,0 --> 01:32:52,0
draw all men unto

125
01:32:52,0 --> 01:32:52,0
me, that as I

126
01:32:52,0 --> 01:32:52,0
have been lifted

127
01:32:52,0 --> 01:32:52,0
up by men even

128
01:32:52,0 --> 01:32:52,0
so should men

129
01:32:52,0 --> 01:32:52,0
be lifted up by

130
01:32:52,0 --> 01:32:52,0
the Father, to

131
01:32:52,0 --> 01:32:52,0
stand before

132
01:32:52,0 --> 01:32:52,0
me, to be judged

133
01:32:52,0 --> 01:32:52,0
of their

134
01:32:52,0 --> 01:32:52,0
works, whether they

135
01:32:52,0 --> 01:36:51,
be good or whether they be evil—

136
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
15 And for

137
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
this cause have I

138
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
been lifted

139
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
up; therefore,

140
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
according to

141
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
the power of

142
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
the Father I

143
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
will draw all men

144
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
unto me, that

145
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
they may be

146
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
judged

147
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,
according to their works.

148
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
16 And it

149
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
shall come to

150
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
pass, that

151
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
whoso repenteth

152
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
and is

153
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
baptized in my name

154
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
shall be

155
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
filled; and if he

156
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
endureth to

157
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
the end,

158
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
behold, him will

159
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
I hold

160
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
guiltless before my

161
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
Father at

162
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
that day when I

163
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
shall stand

164
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,
to judge the world.

165
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
17 And he

166
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
that endureth

167
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
not unto the

168
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
end, the

169
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
same is he

170
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
that is also

171
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
hewn down and

172
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
cast into

173
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
the fire, from

174
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
whence they

175
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
can no more

176
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
return,

177
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
because of the

178
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,
justice of the Father.

179
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
18 And this

180
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
is the

181
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
word which he

182
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
hath given

183
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
unto the

184
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
children of

185
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
men. And for

186
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
this cause

187
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
he

188
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
fulfilleth the

189
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
words which he

190
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
hath

191
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
given, and he

192
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
lieth not,

193
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
but

194
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,
fulfilleth all his words.

195
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
19 And no

196
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
unclean

197
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
thing can

198
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
enter into

199
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
his

200
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
kingdom;

201
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
therefore nothing

202
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
entereth

203
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
into his

204
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
rest save it

205
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
be those

206
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
who have

207
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
washed

208
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
their garments

209
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
in my

210
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
blood,

211
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
because of their

212
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
faith,

213
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
and the

214
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
repentance of

215
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
all their

216
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
sins, and

217
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,
their faithfulness unto the end.

218
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
20 Now

219
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
this is the

220
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0


221
01:36:51,0 --> 01:36:51,0
