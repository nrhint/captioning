1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:02,5
Chapter 27 Jesus commands them to call the Church

2
00:00:02,5 --> 00:00:05,0
 in His name—His mission and atoning sacrifice

3
00:00:05,0 --> 00:00:07,5
 constitute His gospel—Men are commanded to repent and

4
00:00:07,5 --> 00:00:10,0
 be baptized that they may be sanctified by the

5
00:00:10,0 --> 00:00:12,5
 Holy Ghost—They are to be even as Jesus is. About

6
00:00:12,5 --> 00:00:15,0
 A.D. 34–35.

7
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,282
1 And it came to pass that as the disciples of

8
00:00:17,282 --> 00:00:18,615
 Jesus were journeying and were preaching the things

9
00:00:18,615 --> 00:00:19,948
 which they had both heard and seen, and were

10
00:00:19,948 --> 00:00:21,281
 baptizing in the name of Jesus, it came to pass that the

11
00:00:21,281 --> 00:00:22,614
 disciples were gathered together and were united

12
00:00:22,614 --> 00:00:23,947
 in mighty prayer and fasting

13
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,524
2 And Jesus again showed himself unto them, for

14
00:00:25,524 --> 00:00:27,124
 they were praying unto the Father in his name; and

15
00:00:27,124 --> 00:00:28,724
 Jesus came and stood in the midst of them, and said

16
00:00:28,724 --> 00:00:30,324
 unto them: What will ye that I shall give unto

17
00:00:30,324 --> 00:00:31,924
 you

18
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,899
3 And they said unto him: Lord, we will that thou

19
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,899
 wouldst tell us the name whereby we shall call

20
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:37,899
 this church; for there are disputations among the

21
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:39,899
 people concerning this matter

22
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,54
4 And the Lord said unto them: Verily, verily, I

23
00:00:42,54 --> 00:00:45,207
 say unto you, why is it that the people should

24
00:00:45,207 --> 00:00:47,874
 murmur and dispute because of this thing

25
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,848
5 Have they not read the scriptures, which say ye

26
00:00:49,848 --> 00:00:51,848
 must take upon you the name of Christ, which is my

27
00:00:51,848 --> 00:00:53,848
 name? For by this name shall ye be called at the

28
00:00:53,848 --> 00:00:55,848
 last day

29
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:58,489
6 And whoso taketh upon him my name, and endureth

30
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:01,156
 to the end, the same shall be saved at the last

31
00:01:01,156 --> 00:01:03,823
 day

32
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,797
7 Therefore, whatsoever ye shall do, ye shall do

33
00:01:05,797 --> 00:01:07,797
 it in my name; therefore ye shall call the church

34
00:01:07,797 --> 00:01:09,797
 in my name; and ye shall call upon the Father in my

35
00:01:09,797 --> 00:01:11,797
 name that he will bless the church for my sake

36
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:13,105
8 And how be it my church save it be called in my

37
00:01:13,105 --> 00:01:14,438
 name? For if a church be called in Moses’ name

38
00:01:14,438 --> 00:01:15,771
 then it be Moses’ church; or if it be called in the

39
00:01:15,771 --> 00:01:17,104
 name of a man then it be the church of a man; but

40
00:01:17,104 --> 00:01:18,437
 if it be called in my name then it is my church, if

41
00:01:18,437 --> 00:01:19,77
 it so be that they are built upon my gospel

42
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,946
9 Verily I say unto you, that ye are built upon my

43
00:01:22,946 --> 00:01:26,146
 gospel; therefore ye shall call whatsoever things

44
00:01:26,146 --> 00:01:29,346
 ye do call, in my name; therefore if ye call upon

45
00:01:29,346 --> 00:01:32,546
 the Father, for the church, if it be in my name

46
00:01:32,546 --> 00:01:35,746
 the Father will hear you

47
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:43,696
10 And if it so be that the church is built upon

48
00:01:43,696 --> 00:01:51,696
 my gospel then will the Father show forth his own

49
00:01:51,696 --> 00:01:59,696
 works in it

50
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:03,62
11 But if it be not built upon my gospel, and is

51
00:02:03,62 --> 00:02:07,62
 built upon the works of men, or upon the works of

52
00:02:07,62 --> 00:02:11,62
 the devil, verily I say unto you they have joy in

53
00:02:11,62 --> 00:02:15,62
 their works for a season, and by and by the end

54
00:02:15,62 --> 00:02:19,62
 cometh, and they are hewn down and cast into the

55
00:02:19,62 --> 00:02:23,62
 fire, from whence there is no return

56
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:26,21
12 For their works do follow them, for it is

57
00:02:26,21 --> 00:02:28,877
 because of their works that they are hewn down;

58
00:02:28,877 --> 00:02:31,544
 therefore remember the things that I have told you

59
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:35,518
13 Behold I have given unto you my gospel, and

60
00:02:35,518 --> 00:02:39,518
 this is the gospel which I have given unto you—that I

61
00:02:39,518 --> 00:02:43,518
 came into the world to do the will of my Father,

62
00:02:43,518 --> 00:02:47,518
 because my Father sent me

63
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,753
14 And my Father sent me that I might be lifted up

64
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:52,039
 upon the cross; and after that I had been lifted

65
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:54,325
 up upon the cross, that I might draw all men unto

66
00:02:54,325 --> 00:02:56,611
 me, that as I have been lifted up by men even so

67
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:58,897
 should men be lifted up by the Father, to stand

68
00:02:58,897 --> 00:03:01,183
 before me, to be judged of their works, whether they

69
00:03:01,183 --> 00:03:03,469
 be good or whether they be evil

70
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:09,417
15 And for this cause have I been lifted up;

71
00:03:09,417 --> 00:03:15,417
 therefore, according to the power of the Father I will

72
00:03:15,417 --> 00:03:21,417
 draw all men unto me, that they may be judged

73
00:03:21,417 --> 00:03:27,417
 according to their works

74
00:03:27,34 --> 00:03:38,54
16 And it shall come to pass, that whoso repenteth

75
00:03:38,54 --> 00:03:49,74
 and is baptized in my name shall be filled; and

76
00:03:49,74 --> 00:04:00,94
 if he endureth to the end, behold, him will I hold

77
00:04:00,94 --> 00:04:12,14
 guiltless before my Father at that day when I

78
00:04:12,14 --> 00:04:23,34
 shall stand to judge the world

79
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:29,163
17 And he that endureth not unto the end, the same

80
00:04:29,163 --> 00:04:35,163
 is he that is also hewn down and cast into the

81
00:04:35,163 --> 00:04:41,163
 fire, from whence they can no more return, because

82
00:04:41,163 --> 00:04:47,163
 of the justice of the Father

83
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,087
18 And this is the word which he hath given unto

84
00:04:49,087 --> 00:04:51,087
 the children of men. And for this cause he

85
00:04:51,087 --> 00:04:53,087
 fulfilleth the words which he hath given, and he lieth

86
00:04:53,087 --> 00:04:55,087
 not, but fulfilleth all his words

87
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,394
19 And no unclean thing can enter into his

88
00:04:56,394 --> 00:04:57,727
 kingdom; therefore nothing entereth into his rest save it

89
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,06
 be those who have washed their garments in my

90
00:04:59,06 --> 00:05:00,393
 blood, because of their faith, and the repentance of

91
00:05:00,393 --> 00:05:01,726
 all their sins, and their faithfulness unto the

92
00:05:01,726 --> 00:05:03,059
 end

93
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:06,036
20 Now this is the commandment: Repent, all ye

94
00:05:06,036 --> 00:05:09,036
 ends of the earth, and come unto me and be baptized

95
00:05:09,036 --> 00:05:12,036
 in my name, that ye may be sanctified by the

96
00:05:12,036 --> 00:05:15,036
 reception of the Holy Ghost, that ye may stand spotless

97
00:05:15,036 --> 00:05:18,036
 before me at the last day

98
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:23,785
21 Verily, verily, I say unto you, this is my

99
00:05:23,785 --> 00:05:28,585
 gospel; and ye know the things that ye must do in my

100
00:05:28,585 --> 00:05:33,385
 church; for the works which ye have seen me do that

101
00:05:33,385 --> 00:05:38,185
 shall ye also do; for that which ye have seen me

102
00:05:38,185 --> 00:05:42,985
 do even that shall ye do

103
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:46,909
22 Therefore, if ye do these things blessed are

104
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:50,909
 ye, for ye shall be lifted up at the last day

105
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:54,884
23 Write the things which ye have seen and heard,

106
00:05:54,884 --> 00:05:58,884
 save it be those which are forbidden

107
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:04,192
24 Write the works of this people, which shall be,

108
00:06:04,192 --> 00:06:09,524
 even as hath been written, of that which hath

109
00:06:09,524 --> 00:06:14,858
 been

110
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:18,808
25 For behold, out of the books which have been

111
00:06:18,808 --> 00:06:22,808
 written, and which shall be written, shall this

112
00:06:22,808 --> 00:06:26,808
 people be judged, for by them shall their works be

113
00:06:26,808 --> 00:06:30,808
 known unto men

114
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:33,424
26 And behold, all things are written by the

115
00:06:33,424 --> 00:06:36,091
 Father; therefore out of the books which shall be

116
00:06:36,091 --> 00:06:38,758
 written shall the world be judged

117
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:45,132
27 And know ye that ye shall be judges of this

118
00:06:45,132 --> 00:06:51,532
 people, according to the judgment which I shall give

119
00:06:51,532 --> 00:06:57,932
 unto you, which shall be just. Therefore, what

120
00:06:57,932 --> 00:07:04,332
 manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you,

121
00:07:04,332 --> 00:07:10,732
 even as I am

122
00:07:10,63 --> 00:07:18,63
28 And now I go unto the Father. And verily I say

123
00:07:18,63 --> 00:07:26,63
 unto you, whatsoever things ye shall ask the

124
00:07:26,63 --> 00:07:34,63
 Father in my name shall be given unto you

125
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:38,554
29 Therefore, ask, and ye shall receive; knock,

126
00:07:38,554 --> 00:07:42,554
 and it shall be opened unto you; for he that asketh,

127
00:07:42,554 --> 00:07:46,554
 receiveth; and unto him that knocketh, it shall

128
00:07:46,554 --> 00:07:50,554
 be opened

129
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:52,103
30 And now, behold, my joy is great, even unto

130
00:07:52,103 --> 00:07:53,703
 fulness, because of you, and also this generation;

131
00:07:53,703 --> 00:07:55,303
 yea, and even the Father rejoiceth, and also all the

132
00:07:55,303 --> 00:07:56,903
 holy angels, because of you and this generation;

133
00:07:56,903 --> 00:07:58,503
 for none of them are lost

134
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:04,478
31 Behold, I would that ye should understand; for

135
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:10,478
 I mean them who are now alive of this generation;

136
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:16,478
 and none of them are lost; and in them I have

137
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:22,478
 fulness of joy

138
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:29,402
32 But behold, it sorroweth me because of the

139
00:08:29,402 --> 00:08:36,402
 fourth generation from this generation, for they are

140
00:08:36,402 --> 00:08:43,402
 led away captive by him even as was the son of

141
00:08:43,402 --> 00:08:50,402
 perdition; for they will sell me for silver and for

142
00:08:50,402 --> 00:08:57,402
 gold, and for that which moth doth corrupt and which

143
00:08:57,402 --> 00:09:04,402
 thieves can break through and steal. And in that

144
00:09:04,402 --> 00:09:11,402
 day will I visit them, even in turning their works

145
00:09:11,402 --> 00:09:18,402
 upon their own heads

146
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:18,224
33 And it came to pass that when Jesus had ended

147
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:18,224
 these sayings he said unto his disciples: Enter ye

148
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:18,224
 in at the strait gate; for strait is the gate, and

149
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:18,224
 narrow is the way that leads to life, and few

150
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:18,224
 there be that find it; but wide is the gate, and

151
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:18,224
 broad the way which leads to death, and many there be

152
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:18,224
 that travel therein, until the night cometh,

153
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:18,224
 wherein no man can work.
