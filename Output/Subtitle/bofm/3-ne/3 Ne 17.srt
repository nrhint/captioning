00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,4
Chapter 17 Jesus directs the people to ponder

2
00:00:01,4 --> 00:00:02,8
His words and pray for understanding—He heals

3
00:00:02,8 --> 00:00:04,2
their sick—He prays for the people, using

4
00:00:04,2 --> 00:00:05,6
language that cannot be written—Angels minister to and

5
00:00:05,6 --> 00:00:07,04
fire encircles their little ones. About A.D. 34. 

6
00:00:07,04 --> 00:00:12,04
1 Behold, now it came to pass that when

7
00:00:12,04 --> 00:00:17,04
Jesus had spoken these words he looked

8
00:00:17,04 --> 00:00:22,04
round about again on the multitude, and he

9
00:00:22,04 --> 00:00:27,394
said unto them: Behold, my time is at hand.

10
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:30,394
2 I perceive that ye are weak,

11
00:00:30,394 --> 00:00:33,394
that ye cannot understand all my

12
00:00:33,394 --> 00:00:36,394
words which I am commanded of the

13
00:00:36,394 --> 00:00:39,773
Father to speak unto you at this time.

14
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:39,916
3 Therefore, go ye unto your

15
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:40,059
homes, and ponder upon the

16
00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:40,202
things which I have said, and

17
00:00:40,202 --> 00:00:40,345
ask of the Father, in my name,

18
00:00:40,345 --> 00:00:40,488
that ye may understand, and

19
00:00:40,488 --> 00:00:40,631
prepare your minds for the

20
00:00:40,631 --> 00:00:40,24
morrow, and I come unto you again.

21
00:00:40,24 --> 00:00:40,073
4 But now I go unto the

22
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:39,906
Father, and also to show myself

23
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:39,739
unto the lost tribes of

24
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:39,572
Israel, for they are not lost

25
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:39,405
unto the Father, for he

26
00:00:39,405 --> 00:00:39,306
knoweth whither he hath taken them.

27
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:39,195
5 And it came to pass

28
00:00:39,195 --> 00:00:39,084
that when Jesus had thus

29
00:00:39,084 --> 00:00:38,973
spoken, he cast his eyes

30
00:00:38,973 --> 00:00:38,862
round about again on the

31
00:00:38,862 --> 00:00:38,751
multitude, and beheld they

32
00:00:38,751 --> 00:00:38,64
were in tears, and did

33
00:00:38,64 --> 00:00:38,529
look steadfastly upon him as

34
00:00:38,529 --> 00:00:38,418
if they would ask him to

35
00:00:38,418 --> 00:00:38,372
tarry a little longer with them.

36
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:38,122
6 And he said unto

37
00:00:38,122 --> 00:00:37,872
them: Behold, my

38
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:37,622
bowels are filled with

39
00:00:37,622 --> 00:00:37,437
compassion towards you.

40
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:37,562
7 Have ye any that

41
00:00:37,562 --> 00:00:37,687
are sick among you?

42
00:00:37,687 --> 00:00:37,812
Bring them hither.

43
00:00:37,812 --> 00:00:37,937
Have ye any that

44
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:38,062
are lame, or blind,

45
00:00:38,062 --> 00:00:38,187
or halt, or maimed,

46
00:00:38,187 --> 00:00:38,312
or leprous, or

47
00:00:38,312 --> 00:00:38,437
that are withered, or

48
00:00:38,437 --> 00:00:38,562
that are deaf, or

49
00:00:38,562 --> 00:00:38,687
that are afflicted

50
00:00:38,687 --> 00:00:38,812
in any manner? Bring

51
00:00:38,812 --> 00:00:38,937
them hither and I

52
00:00:38,937 --> 00:00:39,062
will heal them, for

53
00:00:39,062 --> 00:00:39,187
I have compassion

54
00:00:39,187 --> 00:00:39,312
upon you; my bowels

55
00:00:39,312 --> 00:00:39,84
are filled with mercy.

56
00:00:39,84 --> 00:00:39,94
8 For I perceive

57
00:00:39,94 --> 00:00:40,04
that ye desire

58
00:00:40,04 --> 00:00:40,14
that I should show

59
00:00:40,14 --> 00:00:40,24
unto you what I

60
00:00:40,24 --> 00:00:40,34
have done unto

61
00:00:40,34 --> 00:00:40,44
your brethren at

62
00:00:40,44 --> 00:00:40,54
Jerusalem, for I see

63
00:00:40,54 --> 00:00:40,64
that your faith

64
00:00:40,64 --> 00:00:40,74
is sufficient

65
00:00:40,74 --> 00:00:40,307
that I should heal you.

66
00:00:40,307 --> 00:00:40,254
9 And it came to

67
00:00:40,254 --> 00:00:40,201
pass that when

68
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:40,148
he had thus

69
00:00:40,148 --> 00:00:40,095
spoken, all the

70
00:00:40,095 --> 00:00:40,042
multitude, with one

71
00:00:40,042 --> 00:00:39,989
accord, did go

72
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:39,936
forth with their

73
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:39,883
sick and their

74
00:00:39,883 --> 00:00:39,83
afflicted, and

75
00:00:39,83 --> 00:00:39,777
their lame, and

76
00:00:39,777 --> 00:00:39,724
with their blind,

77
00:00:39,724 --> 00:00:39,671
and with their

78
00:00:39,671 --> 00:00:39,618
dumb, and with

79
00:00:39,618 --> 00:00:39,565
all them that were

80
00:00:39,565 --> 00:00:39,512
afflicted in

81
00:00:39,512 --> 00:00:39,459
any manner; and he

82
00:00:39,459 --> 00:00:39,406
did heal them

83
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:39,353
every one as they

84
00:00:39,353 --> 00:00:39,373
were brought forth unto him.

85
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:39,306
10 And they did

86
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:39,239
all, both they

87
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:39,172
who had been

88
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:39,105
healed and they

89
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:39,038
who were whole,

90
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:38,971
bow down at

91
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:38,904
his feet, and did

92
00:00:38,904 --> 00:00:38,837
worship him;

93
00:00:38,837 --> 00:00:38,77
and as many as

94
00:00:38,77 --> 00:00:38,703
could come for

95
00:00:38,703 --> 00:00:38,636
the multitude

96
00:00:38,636 --> 00:00:38,569
did kiss his

97
00:00:38,569 --> 00:00:38,502
feet, insomuch that

98
00:00:38,502 --> 00:00:38,435
they did bathe

99
00:00:38,435 --> 00:00:38,438
his feet with their tears.

100
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:38,271
11 And it came

101
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:38,104
to pass that

102
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:37,937
he commanded

103
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:37,77
that their

104
00:00:37,77 --> 00:00:37,603
little children

105
00:00:37,603 --> 00:00:37,504
should be brought.

106
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:37,647
12 So they

107
00:00:37,647 --> 00:00:37,79
brought their

108
00:00:37,79 --> 00:00:37,933
little

109
00:00:37,933 --> 00:00:38,076
children and set

110
00:00:38,076 --> 00:00:38,219
them down upon

111
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:38,362
the ground

112
00:00:38,362 --> 00:00:38,505
round about him,

113
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:38,648
and Jesus

114
00:00:38,648 --> 00:00:38,791
stood in the

115
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:38,934
midst; and the

116
00:00:38,934 --> 00:00:39,077
multitude

117
00:00:39,077 --> 00:00:39,22
gave way till

118
00:00:39,22 --> 00:00:39,363
they had all

119
00:00:39,363 --> 00:00:39,907
been brought unto him.

120
00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:39,83
13 And it

121
00:00:39,83 --> 00:00:39,753
came to pass

122
00:00:39,753 --> 00:00:39,676
that when

123
00:00:39,676 --> 00:00:39,599
they had all

124
00:00:39,599 --> 00:00:39,522
been brought,

125
00:00:39,522 --> 00:00:39,445
and Jesus

126
00:00:39,445 --> 00:00:39,368
stood in the

127
00:00:39,368 --> 00:00:39,291
midst, he

128
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:39,214
commanded the

129
00:00:39,214 --> 00:00:39,137
multitude

130
00:00:39,137 --> 00:00:39,06
that they

131
00:00:39,06 --> 00:00:38,983
should kneel down

132
00:00:38,983 --> 00:00:38,972
upon the ground.

133
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:38,972
14 And it

134
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:38,972
came to pass

135
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:38,972
that when

136
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:38,972
they had

137
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:38,972
knelt upon

138
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:38,972
the ground,

139
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:38,972
Jesus

140
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:38,972
groaned within

141
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:38,972
himself, and

142
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:38,972
said:

143
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:38,972
Father, I am

144
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:38,972
troubled

145
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:38,972
because of the

146
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:38,972
wickedness

147
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:38,972
of the

148
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:38,038
people of the house of Israel.

149
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:37,988
15 And

150
00:00:37,988 --> 00:00:37,938
when he had

151
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:37,888
said these

152
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:37,838
words, he

153
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:37,788
himself

154
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:37,738
also knelt

155
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:37,688
upon the

156
00:00:37,688 --> 00:00:37,638
earth; and

157
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:37,588
behold he

158
00:00:37,588 --> 00:00:37,538
prayed unto

159
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:37,488
the

160
00:00:37,488 --> 00:00:37,438
Father, and the

161
00:00:37,438 --> 00:00:37,388
things

162
00:00:37,388 --> 00:00:37,338
which he

163
00:00:37,338 --> 00:00:37,288
prayed cannot

164
00:00:37,288 --> 00:00:37,238
be

165
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:37,188
written, and the

166
00:00:37,188 --> 00:00:37,138
multitude

167
00:00:37,138 --> 00:00:37,088
did bear

168
00:00:37,088 --> 00:00:37,104
record who heard him.

169
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:37,209
16 And

170
00:00:37,209 --> 00:00:37,314
after this

171
00:00:37,314 --> 00:00:37,419
manner do

172
00:00:37,419 --> 00:00:37,524
they

173
00:00:37,524 --> 00:00:37,629
bear record:

174
00:00:37,629 --> 00:00:37,734
The eye

175
00:00:37,734 --> 00:00:37,839
hath

176
00:00:37,839 --> 00:00:37,944
never seen,

177
00:00:37,944 --> 00:00:38,049
neither

178
00:00:38,049 --> 00:00:38,154
hath the

179
00:00:38,154 --> 00:00:38,259
ear heard,

180
00:00:38,259 --> 00:00:38,364
before,

181
00:00:38,364 --> 00:00:38,469
so great

182
00:00:38,469 --> 00:00:38,574
and

183
00:00:38,574 --> 00:00:38,679
marvelous

184
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:38,784
things as we

185
00:00:38,784 --> 00:00:38,889
saw and

186
00:00:38,889 --> 00:00:38,994
heard Jesus

187
00:00:38,994 --> 00:00:39,506
speak unto the Father;

188
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:39,475
17 And

189
00:00:39,475 --> 00:00:39,444
no tongue

190
00:00:39,444 --> 00:00:39,413
can

191
00:00:39,413 --> 00:00:39,382
speak,

192
00:00:39,382 --> 00:00:39,351
neither can

193
00:00:39,351 --> 00:00:39,32
there be

194
00:00:39,32 --> 00:00:39,289
written

195
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:39,258
by any

196
00:00:39,258 --> 00:00:39,227
man,

197
00:00:39,227 --> 00:00:39,196
neither can

198
00:00:39,196 --> 00:00:39,165
the

199
00:00:39,165 --> 00:00:39,134
hearts of

200
00:00:39,134 --> 00:00:39,103
men

201
00:00:39,103 --> 00:00:39,072
conceive so

202
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:39,041
great and

203
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:39,01


204
00:00:39,01 --> 00:00:38,979
marvelous

205

both saw

207
00:00:38,917 --> 00:00:38,886
and

208
00:00:38,886 --> 00:00:38,855
heard Jesus

209
00:00:38,855 --> 00:00:38,824
speak;

210
00:00:38,824 --> 00:00:38,793
and no

211
00:00:38,793 --> 00:00:38,762

214
00:00:38,7 --> 00:00:38,669
joy which

215
00:00:38,669 --> 00:00:38,638
filled

216
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:38,607
our

217
00:00:38,607 --> 00:00:38,576
souls at the

218
00:00:38,576 --> 00:00:38,545
time we

219
00:00:38,545 --> 00:00:38,572
heard him pray for us unto the Father.

220
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:38,522
18 And

221
00:00:38,522 --> 00:00:38,472
it came

222
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:38,422
to

223
00:00:38,422 --> 00:00:38,372
pass that

224
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:38,322
when

225
00:00:38,322 --> 00:00:38,272
Jesus had

226
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:38,222

227
00:00:38,222 --> 00:00:38,172
an end

228
00:00:38,172 --> 00:00:38,122

229
00:00:38,122 --> 00:00:38,072
praying unto

230
00:00:38,072 --> 00:00:38,022

232
00:00:37,972 --> 00:00:37,922
he

233
00:00:37,922 --> 00:00:37,872
arose; but

234
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:37,822
so great

235
00:00:37,822 --> 00:00:37,772
was

236
00:00:37,772 --> 00:00:37,722
the joy

237
00:00:37,722 --> 00:00:37,672

240
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:37,911
19 And

241
00:00:37,911 --> 00:00:38,184
it

242
00:00:38,184 --> 00:00:38,457

243
00:00:38,457 --> 00:00:38,73
pass

244
00:00:38,73 --> 00:00:39,003

245
00:00:39,003 --> 00:00:39,276

246
00:00:39,276 --> 00:00:39,549

247
00:00:39,549 --> 00:00:39,822

248
00:00:39,822 --> 00:00:40,095
them, and

249
00:00:40,095 --> 00:00:40,368
bade

250
00:00:40,368 --> 00:00:40,04
them arise.

251
00:00:40,04 --> 00:00:39,992
20 And

252
00:00:39,992 --> 00:00:39,944
they

253
00:00:39,944 --> 00:00:39,896
arose

254
00:00:39,896 --> 00:00:39,848
from

255
00:00:39,848 --> 00:00:39,8
the

256
00:00:39,8 --> 00:00:39,752

257
00:00:39,752 --> 00:00:39,704
and he

258
00:00:39,704 --> 00:00:39,656
said

259
00:00:39,656 --> 00:00:39,608

260
00:00:39,608 --> 00:00:39,56
them:

261
00:00:39,56 --> 00:00:39,512
Blessed

262
00:00:39,512 --> 00:00:39,464

And now

00:00:39,176 --> 00:00:39,128
behold, my
