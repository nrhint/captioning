00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 17 Jesus directs the people to ponder

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
His words and pray for understanding—He heals

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
their sick—He prays for the people, using

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
language that cannot be written—Angels minister to and

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:14:52,
fire encircles their little ones. About A.D. 34. 

6
00:14:52,0 --> 00:14:52,0
1 Behold, now it came to pass that when

7
00:14:52,0 --> 00:14:52,0
Jesus had spoken these words he looked

8
00:14:52,0 --> 00:14:52,0
round about again on the multitude, and he

9
00:14:52,0 --> 00:19:49,
said unto them: Behold, my time is at hand.

10
00:19:49,0 --> 00:19:49,0
2 I perceive that ye are weak,

11
00:19:49,0 --> 00:19:49,0
that ye cannot understand all my

12
00:19:49,0 --> 00:19:49,0
words which I am commanded of the

13
00:19:49,0 --> 00:19:21,
Father to speak unto you at this time.

14
00:19:21,0 --> 00:19:21,0
3 Therefore, go ye unto your

15
00:19:21,0 --> 00:19:21,0
homes, and ponder upon the

16
00:19:21,0 --> 00:19:21,0
things which I have said, and

17
00:19:21,0 --> 00:19:21,0
ask of the Father, in my name,

18
00:19:21,0 --> 00:19:21,0
that ye may understand, and

19
00:19:21,0 --> 00:19:21,0
prepare your minds for the

20
00:19:21,0 --> 00:18:53,
morrow, and I come unto you again.

21
00:18:53,0 --> 00:18:53,0
4 But now I go unto the

22
00:18:53,0 --> 00:18:53,0
Father, and also to show myself

23
00:18:53,0 --> 00:18:53,0
unto the lost tribes of

24
00:18:53,0 --> 00:18:53,0
Israel, for they are not lost

25
00:18:53,0 --> 00:18:53,0
unto the Father, for he

26
00:18:53,0 --> 00:19:51,
knoweth whither he hath taken them.

27
00:19:51,0 --> 00:19:51,0
5 And it came to pass

28
00:19:51,0 --> 00:19:51,0
that when Jesus had thus

29
00:19:51,0 --> 00:19:51,0
spoken, he cast his eyes

30
00:19:51,0 --> 00:19:51,0
round about again on the

31
00:19:51,0 --> 00:19:51,0
multitude, and beheld they

32
00:19:51,0 --> 00:19:51,0
were in tears, and did

33
00:19:51,0 --> 00:19:51,0
look steadfastly upon him as

34
00:19:51,0 --> 00:19:51,0
if they would ask him to

35
00:19:51,0 --> 00:19:23,
tarry a little longer with them.

36
00:19:23,0 --> 00:19:23,0
6 And he said unto

37
00:19:23,0 --> 00:19:23,0
them: Behold, my

38
00:19:23,0 --> 00:19:23,0
bowels are filled with

39
00:19:23,0 --> 00:18:55,
compassion towards you.

40
00:18:55,0 --> 00:18:55,0
7 Have ye any that

41
00:18:55,0 --> 00:18:55,0
are sick among you?

42
00:18:55,0 --> 00:18:55,0
Bring them hither.

43
00:18:55,0 --> 00:18:55,0
Have ye any that

44
00:18:55,0 --> 00:18:55,0
are lame, or blind,

45
00:18:55,0 --> 00:18:55,0
or halt, or maimed,

46
00:18:55,0 --> 00:18:55,0
or leprous, or

47
00:18:55,0 --> 00:18:55,0
that are withered, or

48
00:18:55,0 --> 00:18:55,0
that are deaf, or

49
00:18:55,0 --> 00:18:55,0
that are afflicted

50
00:18:55,0 --> 00:18:55,0
in any manner? Bring

51
00:18:55,0 --> 00:18:55,0
them hither and I

52
00:18:55,0 --> 00:18:55,0
will heal them, for

53
00:18:55,0 --> 00:18:55,0
I have compassion

54
00:18:55,0 --> 00:18:55,0
upon you; my bowels

55
00:18:55,0 --> 00:19:39,
are filled with mercy.

56
00:19:39,0 --> 00:19:39,0
8 For I perceive

57
00:19:39,0 --> 00:19:39,0
that ye desire

58
00:19:39,0 --> 00:19:39,0
that I should show

59
00:19:39,0 --> 00:19:39,0
unto you what I

60
00:19:39,0 --> 00:19:39,0
have done unto

61
00:19:39,0 --> 00:19:39,0
your brethren at

62
00:19:39,0 --> 00:19:39,0
Jerusalem, for I see

63
00:19:39,0 --> 00:19:39,0
that your faith

64
00:19:39,0 --> 00:19:39,0
is sufficient

65
00:19:39,0 --> 00:19:11,
that I should heal you.

66
00:19:11,0 --> 00:19:11,0
9 And it came to

67
00:19:11,0 --> 00:19:11,0
pass that when

68
00:19:11,0 --> 00:19:11,0
he had thus

69
00:19:11,0 --> 00:19:11,0
spoken, all the

70
00:19:11,0 --> 00:19:11,0
multitude, with one

71
00:19:11,0 --> 00:19:11,0
accord, did go

72
00:19:11,0 --> 00:19:11,0
forth with their

73
00:19:11,0 --> 00:19:11,0
sick and their

74
00:19:11,0 --> 00:19:11,0
afflicted, and

75
00:19:11,0 --> 00:19:11,0
their lame, and

76
00:19:11,0 --> 00:19:11,0
with their blind,

77
00:19:11,0 --> 00:19:11,0
and with their

78
00:19:11,0 --> 00:19:11,0
dumb, and with

79
00:19:11,0 --> 00:19:11,0
all them that were

80
00:19:11,0 --> 00:19:11,0
afflicted in

81
00:19:11,0 --> 00:19:11,0
any manner; and he

82
00:19:11,0 --> 00:19:11,0
did heal them

83
00:19:11,0 --> 00:19:11,0
every one as they

84
00:19:11,0 --> 00:19:25,
were brought forth unto him.

85
00:19:25,0 --> 00:19:25,0
10 And they did

86
00:19:25,0 --> 00:19:25,0
all, both they

87
00:19:25,0 --> 00:19:25,0
who had been

88
00:19:25,0 --> 00:19:25,0
healed and they

89
00:19:25,0 --> 00:19:25,0
who were whole,

90
00:19:25,0 --> 00:19:25,0
bow down at

91
00:19:25,0 --> 00:19:25,0
his feet, and did

92
00:19:25,0 --> 00:19:25,0
worship him;

93
00:19:25,0 --> 00:19:25,0
and as many as

94
00:19:25,0 --> 00:19:25,0
could come for

95
00:19:25,0 --> 00:19:25,0
the multitude

96
00:19:25,0 --> 00:19:25,0
did kiss his

97
00:19:25,0 --> 00:19:25,0
feet, insomuch that

98
00:19:25,0 --> 00:19:25,0
they did bathe

99
00:19:25,0 --> 00:18:57,
his feet with their tears.

100
00:18:57,0 --> 00:18:57,0
11 And it came

101
00:18:57,0 --> 00:18:57,0
to pass that

102
00:18:57,0 --> 00:18:57,0
he commanded

103
00:18:57,0 --> 00:18:57,0
that their

104
00:18:57,0 --> 00:18:57,0
little children

105
00:18:57,0 --> 00:19:41,
should be brought.

106
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:41,0
12 So they

107
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:41,0
brought their

108
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:41,0
little

109
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:41,0
children and set

110
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:41,0
them down upon

111
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:41,0
the ground

112
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:41,0
round about him,

113
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:41,0
and Jesus

114
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:41,0
stood in the

115
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:41,0
midst; and the

116
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:41,0
multitude

117
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:41,0
gave way till

118
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:41,0
they had all

119
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:13,
been brought unto him.

120
00:19:13,0 --> 00:19:13,0
13 And it

121
00:19:13,0 --> 00:19:13,0
came to pass

122
00:19:13,0 --> 00:19:13,0
that when

123
00:19:13,0 --> 00:19:13,0
they had all

124
00:19:13,0 --> 00:19:13,0
been brought,

125
00:19:13,0 --> 00:19:13,0
and Jesus

126
00:19:13,0 --> 00:19:13,0
stood in the

127
00:19:13,0 --> 00:19:13,0
midst, he

128
00:19:13,0 --> 00:19:13,0
commanded the

129
00:19:13,0 --> 00:19:13,0
multitude

130
00:19:13,0 --> 00:19:13,0
that they

131
00:19:13,0 --> 00:19:13,0
should kneel down

132
00:19:13,0 --> 00:19:27,
upon the ground.

133
00:19:27,0 --> 00:19:27,0
14 And it

134
00:19:27,0 --> 00:19:27,0
came to pass

135
00:19:27,0 --> 00:19:27,0
that when

136
00:19:27,0 --> 00:19:27,0
they had

137
00:19:27,0 --> 00:19:27,0
knelt upon

138
00:19:27,0 --> 00:19:27,0
the ground,

139
00:19:27,0 --> 00:19:27,0
Jesus

140
00:19:27,0 --> 00:19:27,0
groaned within

141
00:19:27,0 --> 00:19:27,0
himself, and

142
00:19:27,0 --> 00:19:27,0
said:

143
00:19:27,0 --> 00:19:27,0
Father, I am

144
00:19:27,0 --> 00:19:27,0
troubled

145
00:19:27,0 --> 00:19:27,0
because of the

146
00:19:27,0 --> 00:19:27,0
wickedness

147
00:19:27,0 --> 00:19:27,0
of the

148
00:19:27,0 --> 00:18:59,
people of the house of Israel.

149
00:18:59,0 --> 00:18:59,0
15 And

150
00:18:59,0 --> 00:18:59,0
when he had

151
00:18:59,0 --> 00:18:59,0
said these

152
00:18:59,0 --> 00:18:59,0
words, he

153
00:18:59,0 --> 00:18:59,0
himself

154
00:18:59,0 --> 00:18:59,0
also knelt

155
00:18:59,0 --> 00:18:59,0
upon the

156
00:18:59,0 --> 00:18:59,0
earth; and

157
00:18:59,0 --> 00:18:59,0
behold he

158
00:18:59,0 --> 00:18:59,0
prayed unto

159
00:18:59,0 --> 00:18:59,0
the

160
00:18:59,0 --> 00:18:59,0
Father, and the

161
00:18:59,0 --> 00:18:59,0
things

162
00:18:59,0 --> 00:18:59,0
which he

163
00:18:59,0 --> 00:18:59,0
prayed cannot

164
00:18:59,0 --> 00:18:59,0
be

165
00:18:59,0 --> 00:18:59,0
written, and the

166
00:18:59,0 --> 00:18:59,0
multitude

167
00:18:59,0 --> 00:18:59,0
did bear

168
00:18:59,0 --> 00:19:43,
record who heard him.

169
00:19:43,0 --> 00:19:43,0
16 And

170
00:19:43,0 --> 00:19:43,0
after this

171
00:19:43,0 --> 00:19:43,0
manner do

172
00:19:43,0 --> 00:19:43,0
they

173
00:19:43,0 --> 00:19:43,0
bear record:

174
00:19:43,0 --> 00:19:43,0
The eye

175
00:19:43,0 --> 00:19:43,0
hath

176
00:19:43,0 --> 00:19:43,0
never seen,

177
00:19:43,0 --> 00:19:43,0
neither

178
00:19:43,0 --> 00:19:43,0
hath the

179
00:19:43,0 --> 00:19:43,0
ear heard,

180
00:19:43,0 --> 00:19:43,0
before,

181
00:19:43,0 --> 00:19:43,0
so great

182
00:19:43,0 --> 00:19:43,0
and

183
00:19:43,0 --> 00:19:43,0
marvelous

184
00:19:43,0 --> 00:19:43,0
things as we

185
00:19:43,0 --> 00:19:43,0
saw and

186
00:19:43,0 --> 00:19:43,0
heard Jesus

187
00:19:43,0 --> 00:19:15,
speak unto the Father;

188
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
17 And

189
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
no tongue

190
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
can

191
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
speak,

192
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
neither can

193
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
there be

194
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
written

195
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
by any

196
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
man,

197
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
neither can

198
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
the

199
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
hearts of

200
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
men

201
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
conceive so

202
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
great and

203
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0


204
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
marvelous

205
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
things as we

206
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
both saw

207
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
and

208
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
heard Jesus

209
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
speak;

210
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
and no

211
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
one can

212
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
conceive

213
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
of the

214
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
joy which

215
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
filled

216
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
our

217
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
souls at the

218
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:15,0
time we

219
00:19:15,0 --> 00:19:29,
heard him pray for us unto the Father.

220
00:19:29,0 --> 00:19:29,0
18 And

221
00:19:29,0 --> 00:19:29,0
it came

222
00:19:29,0 --> 00:19:29,0
to

223
00:19:29,0 --> 00:19:29,0
pass that

224
00:19:29,0 --> 00:19:29,0
when

225
00:19:29,0 --> 00:19:29,0
Jesus had

226
00:19:29,0 --> 00:19:29,0
