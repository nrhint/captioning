00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:03,0
Chapter 17 Jesus directs the people to ponder His

2
00:00:03,0 --> 00:00:06,0
 words and pray for understanding—He heals their

3
00:00:06,0 --> 00:00:09,0
 sick—He prays for the people, using language that

4
00:00:09,0 --> 00:00:12,0
 cannot be written—Angels minister to and fire

5
00:00:12,0 --> 00:00:15,0
 encircles their little ones. About A.D. 34.

6
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:21,949
1 Behold, now it came to pass that when Jesus had

7
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:27,949
 spoken these words he looked round about again on

8
00:00:27,949 --> 00:00:33,949
 the multitude, and he said unto them: Behold, my

9
00:00:33,949 --> 00:00:39,949
 time is at hand

10
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:45,206
2 I perceive that ye are weak, that ye cannot

11
00:00:45,206 --> 00:00:50,539
 understand all my words which I am commanded of the

12
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:55,872
 Father to speak unto you at this time

13
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,422
3 Therefore, go ye unto your homes, and ponder

14
00:00:57,422 --> 00:00:59,022
 upon the things which I have said, and ask of the

15
00:00:59,022 --> 00:01:00,622
 Father, in my name, that ye may understand, and

16
00:01:00,622 --> 00:01:02,222
 prepare your minds for the morrow, and I come unto you

17
00:01:02,222 --> 00:01:03,822
 again

18
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,797
4 But now I go unto the Father, and also to show

19
00:01:05,797 --> 00:01:07,797
 myself unto the lost tribes of Israel, for they are

20
00:01:07,797 --> 00:01:09,797
 not lost unto the Father, for he knoweth whither

21
00:01:09,797 --> 00:01:11,797
 he hath taken them

22
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:13,372
5 And it came to pass that when Jesus had thus

23
00:01:13,372 --> 00:01:14,972
 spoken, he cast his eyes round about again on the

24
00:01:14,972 --> 00:01:16,572
 multitude, and beheld they were in tears, and did

25
00:01:16,572 --> 00:01:18,172
 look steadfastly upon him as if they would ask him to

26
00:01:18,172 --> 00:01:19,772
 tarry a little longer with them

27
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:23,746
6 And he said unto them: Behold, my bowels are

28
00:01:23,746 --> 00:01:27,746
 filled with compassion towards you

29
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:30,007
7 Have ye any that are sick among you? Bring them

30
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:32,293
 hither. Have ye any that are lame, or blind, or

31
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:34,579
 halt, or maimed, or leprous, or that are withered,

32
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:36,865
 or that are deaf, or that are afflicted in any

33
00:01:36,865 --> 00:01:39,151
 manner? Bring them hither and I will heal them, for I

34
00:01:39,151 --> 00:01:41,437
 have compassion upon you; my bowels are filled

35
00:01:41,437 --> 00:01:43,723
 with mercy

36
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:45,67
8 For I perceive that ye desire that I should show

37
00:01:45,67 --> 00:01:47,67
 unto you what I have done unto your brethren at

38
00:01:47,67 --> 00:01:49,67
 Jerusalem, for I see that your faith is sufficient

39
00:01:49,67 --> 00:01:51,67
 that I should heal you

40
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:52,788
9 And it came to pass that when he had thus

41
00:01:52,788 --> 00:01:53,931
 spoken, all the multitude, with one accord, did go forth

42
00:01:53,931 --> 00:01:55,074
 with their sick and their afflicted, and their

43
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:56,217
 lame, and with their blind, and with their dumb, and

44
00:01:56,217 --> 00:01:57,36
 with all them that were afflicted in any manner;

45
00:01:57,36 --> 00:01:58,503
 and he did heal them every one as they were

46
00:01:58,503 --> 00:01:59,646
 brought forth unto him

47
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:01,219
10 And they did all, both they who had been healed

48
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:02,82
 and they who were whole, bow down at his feet,

49
00:02:02,82 --> 00:02:04,419
 and did worship him; and as many as could come for

50
00:02:04,419 --> 00:02:06,02
 the multitude did kiss his feet, insomuch that they

51
00:02:06,02 --> 00:02:07,62
 did bathe his feet with their tears

52
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:11,594
11 And it came to pass that he commanded that

53
00:02:11,594 --> 00:02:15,594
 their little children should be brought

54
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:17,569
12 So they brought their little children and set

55
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:19,569
 them down upon the ground round about him, and

56
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:21,569
 Jesus stood in the midst; and the multitude gave way

57
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:23,569
 till they had all been brought unto him

58
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,543
13 And it came to pass that when they had all been

59
00:02:25,543 --> 00:02:27,543
 brought, and Jesus stood in the midst, he

60
00:02:27,543 --> 00:02:29,543
 commanded the multitude that they should kneel down upon

61
00:02:29,543 --> 00:02:31,543
 the ground

62
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,518
14 And it came to pass that when they had knelt

63
00:02:33,518 --> 00:02:35,518
 upon the ground, Jesus groaned within himself, and

64
00:02:35,518 --> 00:02:37,518
 said: Father, I am troubled because of the

65
00:02:37,518 --> 00:02:39,518
 wickedness of the people of the house of Israel

66
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,093
15 And when he had said these words, he himself

67
00:02:41,093 --> 00:02:42,693
 also knelt upon the earth; and behold he prayed unto

68
00:02:42,693 --> 00:02:44,293
 the Father, and the things which he prayed cannot

69
00:02:44,293 --> 00:02:45,893
 be written, and the multitude did bear record who

70
00:02:45,893 --> 00:02:47,493
 heard him

71
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,467
16 And after this manner do they bear record: The

72
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:51,467
 eye hath never seen, neither hath the ear heard,

73
00:02:51,467 --> 00:02:53,467
 before, so great and marvelous things as we saw and

74
00:02:53,467 --> 00:02:55,467
 heard Jesus speak unto the Father

75
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:56,775
17 And no tongue can speak, neither can there be

76
00:02:56,775 --> 00:02:58,108
 written by any man, neither can the hearts of men

77
00:02:58,108 --> 00:02:59,441
 conceive so great and marvelous things as we both

78
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:00,774
 saw and heard Jesus speak; and no one can conceive

79
00:03:00,774 --> 00:03:02,107
 of the joy which filled our souls at the time we

80
00:03:02,107 --> 00:03:03,44
 heard him pray for us unto the Father

81
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,417
18 And it came to pass that when Jesus had made an

82
00:03:05,417 --> 00:03:07,417
 end of praying unto the Father, he arose; but so

83
00:03:07,417 --> 00:03:09,417
 great was the joy of the multitude that they were

84
00:03:09,417 --> 00:03:11,417
 overcome

85
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:15,391
19 And it came to pass that Jesus spake unto them,

86
00:03:15,391 --> 00:03:19,391
 and bade them arise

87
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:22,033
20 And they arose from the earth, and he said unto

88
00:03:22,033 --> 00:03:24,7
 them: Blessed are ye because of your faith. And

89
00:03:24,7 --> 00:03:27,367
 now behold, my joy is full

90
00:03:27,34 --> 00:03:29,34
21 And when he had said these words, he wept, and

91
00:03:29,34 --> 00:03:31,34
 the multitude bare record of it, and he took their

92
00:03:31,34 --> 00:03:33,34
 little children, one by one, and blessed them,

93
00:03:33,34 --> 00:03:35,34
 and prayed unto the Father for them

94
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:43,315
22 And when he had done this he wept again

95
00:03:43,29 --> 00:03:47,29
23 And he spake unto the multitude, and said unto

96
00:03:47,29 --> 00:03:51,29
 them: Behold your little ones

97
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:55,835
24 And as they looked to behold they cast their

98
00:03:55,835 --> 00:04:00,406
 eyes towards heaven, and they saw the heavens open,

99
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:04,977
 and they saw angels descending out of heaven as it

100
00:04:04,977 --> 00:04:09,548
 were in the midst of fire; and they came down and

101
00:04:09,548 --> 00:04:14,119
 encircled those little ones about, and they were

102
00:04:14,119 --> 00:04:18,69
 encircled about with fire; and the angels did

103
00:04:18,69 --> 00:04:23,261
 minister unto them

104
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:23,33
25 And the multitude did see and hear and bear

105
00:04:23,33 --> 00:04:23,497
 record; and they know that their record is true for

106
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:23,664
 they all of them did see and hear, every man for

107
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:23,831
 himself; and they were in number about two thousand

108
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:23,998
 and five hundred souls; and they did consist of

109
00:04:23,998 --> 00:04:24,165
 men, women, and children.
