00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,75
Chapter 25 At the Second Coming, the proud

2
00:00:01,75 --> 00:00:03,5
and wicked will be burned as

3
00:00:03,5 --> 00:00:05,25
stubble—Elijah will return before that great and

4
00:00:05,25 --> 00:00:07,508
dreadful day—Compare 
Malachi 4. About A.D. 34. 

5
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:09,841
1 For behold, the day cometh that shall

6
00:00:09,841 --> 00:00:12,174
burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea,

7
00:00:12,174 --> 00:00:14,507
and all that do wickedly, shall be

8
00:00:14,507 --> 00:00:16,84
stubble; and the day that cometh shall burn

9
00:00:16,84 --> 00:00:19,172
them up, saith the Lord of Hosts, that

10
00:00:19,172 --> 00:00:21,788
it shall leave them neither root nor branch.

11
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:25,788
2 But unto you that fear my name,

12
00:00:25,788 --> 00:00:29,788
shall the Son of Righteousness arise with

13
00:00:29,788 --> 00:00:33,788
healing in his wings; and ye shall go

14
00:00:33,788 --> 00:00:37,738
forth and grow up as calves in the stall.

15
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:49,988
3 And ye shall tread down the wicked;

16
00:00:49,988 --> 00:01:02,238
for they shall be ashes under the

17
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:14,488
soles of your feet in the day that I

18
00:01:14,488 --> 00:01:26,053
shall do this, saith the Lord of Hosts.

19
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:29,053
4 Remember ye the law of Moses,

20
00:01:29,053 --> 00:01:32,053
my servant, which I commanded

21
00:01:32,053 --> 00:01:35,053
unto him in Horeb for all Israel,

22
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:38,398
with the statutes and judgments.

23
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:42,148
5 Behold, I will send you

24
00:01:42,148 --> 00:01:45,898
Elijah the prophet before

25
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:49,648
the coming of the great

26
00:01:49,648 --> 00:01:53,413
and dreadful day of the Lord;

27
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:57,413
6 And he shall turn the

28
00:01:57,413 --> 00:02:01,413
heart of the fathers to the

29
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:05,413
children, and the heart of

30
00:02:05,413 --> 00:02:09,413
the children to their

31
00:02:09,413 --> 00:02:13,413
fathers, lest I come and

32
00:02:13,413 --> 00:02:17,804
smite the earth with a curse.
