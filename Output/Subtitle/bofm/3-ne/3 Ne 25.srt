00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,75
Chapter 25 At the Second Coming, the proud and

2
00:00:01,75 --> 00:00:03,5
 wicked will be burned as stubble—Elijah will return

3
00:00:03,5 --> 00:00:05,25
 before that great and dreadful day—Compare 
Malachi

4
00:00:05,25 --> 00:00:07,0
 4. About A.D. 34.

5
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,575
1 For behold, the day cometh that shall burn as an

6
00:00:09,575 --> 00:00:11,175
 oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do

7
00:00:11,175 --> 00:00:12,775
 wickedly, shall be stubble; and the day that cometh

8
00:00:12,775 --> 00:00:14,375
 shall burn them up, saith the Lord of Hosts, that

9
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:15,975
 it shall leave them neither root nor branch

10
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,949
2 But unto you that fear my name, shall the Son of

11
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:19,949
 Righteousness arise with healing in his wings;

12
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:21,949
 and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves in the

13
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:23,949
 stall

14
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:26,591
3 And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they

15
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:29,258
 shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the

16
00:00:29,258 --> 00:00:31,925
 day that I shall do this, saith the Lord of Hosts

17
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:39,899
4 Remember ye the law of Moses, my servant, which

18
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:47,899
 I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, with

19
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:55,899
 the statutes and judgments

20
00:00:55,822 --> 00:01:01,155
5 Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet

21
00:01:01,155 --> 00:01:06,488
 before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the

22
00:01:06,488 --> 00:01:11,821
 Lord

23
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:12,022
6 And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to

24
00:01:12,022 --> 00:01:12,272
 the children, and the heart of the children to their

25
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:12,522
 fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a

26
00:01:12,522 --> 00:01:12,772
 curse.
