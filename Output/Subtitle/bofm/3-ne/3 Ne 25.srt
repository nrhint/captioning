00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 25 At the Second Coming, the proud

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and wicked will be burned as

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
stubble—Elijah will return before that great and

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:12:10,
dreadful day—Compare 
Malachi 4. About A.D. 34. 

5
00:12:10,0 --> 00:12:10,0
1 For behold, the day cometh that shall

6
00:12:10,0 --> 00:12:10,0
burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea,

7
00:12:10,0 --> 00:12:10,0
and all that do wickedly, shall be

8
00:12:10,0 --> 00:12:10,0
stubble; and the day that cometh shall burn

9
00:12:10,0 --> 00:12:10,0
them up, saith the Lord of Hosts, that

10
00:12:10,0 --> 00:18:21,
it shall leave them neither root nor branch.

11
00:18:21,0 --> 00:18:21,0
2 But unto you that fear my name,

12
00:18:21,0 --> 00:18:21,0
shall the Son of Righteousness arise with

13
00:18:21,0 --> 00:18:21,0
healing in his wings; and ye shall go

14
00:18:21,0 --> 00:19:33,
forth and grow up as calves in the stall.

15
00:19:33,0 --> 00:19:33,0
3 And ye shall tread down the wicked;

16
00:19:33,0 --> 00:19:33,0
for they shall be ashes under the

17
00:19:33,0 --> 00:19:33,0
soles of your feet in the day that I

18
00:19:33,0 --> 00:25:43,
shall do this, saith the Lord of Hosts.

19
00:25:43,0 --> 00:25:43,0
4 Remember ye the law of Moses,

20
00:25:43,0 --> 00:25:43,0
my servant, which I commanded

21
00:25:43,0 --> 00:25:43,0
unto him in Horeb for all Israel,

22
00:25:43,0 --> 00:42:51,
with the statutes and judgments.

23
00:42:51,0 --> 00:42:51,0
5 Behold, I will send you

24
00:42:51,0 --> 00:42:51,0
Elijah the prophet before

25
00:42:51,0 --> 00:42:51,0
the coming of the great

26
00:42:51,0 --> 00:50:48,
and dreadful day of the Lord;

27
00:50:48,0 --> 00:50:48,0
6 And he shall turn the

28
00:50:48,0 --> 00:50:48,0
heart of the fathers to the

29
00:50:48,0 --> 00:50:48,0
children, and the heart of

30
00:50:48,0 --> 00:50:48,0
the children to their

31
00:50:48,0 --> 00:50:48,0
fathers, lest I come and

32
00:50:48,0 --> 01:08:56,
smite the earth with a curse.
