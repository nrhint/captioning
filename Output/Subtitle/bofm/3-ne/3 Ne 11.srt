1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:03,25
Jesus Christ did show himself unto the people of

2
00:00:03,25 --> 00:00:06,5
 Nephi, as the multitude were gathered together in

3
00:00:06,5 --> 00:00:09,75
 the land Bountiful, and did minister unto them; and

4
00:00:09,75 --> 00:00:13,0
 on this wise did he show himself unto them.

5
00:00:13,0 --> 00:00:16,25
 Comprising chapters 11 through 26.Chapter 11 The Father

6
00:00:16,25 --> 00:00:19,5
 testifies of His Beloved Son—Christ appears and

7
00:00:19,5 --> 00:00:22,75
 proclaims His Atonement—The people feel the wound

8
00:00:22,75 --> 00:00:26,0
 marks in His hands and feet and side—They cry

9
00:00:26,0 --> 00:00:29,25
 Hosanna—He sets forth the mode and manner of

10
00:00:29,25 --> 00:00:32,5
 baptism—The spirit of contention is of the devil—Christ’s

11
00:00:32,5 --> 00:00:35,75
 doctrine is that men should believe and be baptized

12
00:00:35,75 --> 00:00:39,0
 and receive the Holy Ghost. About A.D. 34.

13
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,016
1 And now it came to pass that there were a great

14
00:00:41,016 --> 00:00:42,159
 multitude gathered together, of the people of

15
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:43,302
 Nephi, round about the temple which was in the land

16
00:00:43,302 --> 00:00:44,445
 Bountiful; and they were marveling and wondering one

17
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:45,588
 with another, and were showing one to another the

18
00:00:45,588 --> 00:00:46,731
 great and marvelous change which had taken place

19
00:00:46,731 --> 00:00:47,874


20
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:50,515
2 And they were also conversing about this Jesus

21
00:00:50,515 --> 00:00:53,182
 Christ, of whom the sign had been given concerning

22
00:00:53,182 --> 00:00:55,849
 his death

23
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:56,549
3 And it came to pass that while they were thus

24
00:00:56,549 --> 00:00:57,276
 conversing one with another, they heard a voice as

25
00:00:57,276 --> 00:00:58,003
 if it came out of heaven; and they cast their eyes

26
00:00:58,003 --> 00:00:58,73
 round about, for they understood not the voice

27
00:00:58,73 --> 00:00:59,457
 which they heard; and it was not a harsh voice,

28
00:00:59,457 --> 00:01:00,184
 neither was it a loud voice; nevertheless, and

29
00:01:00,184 --> 00:01:00,911
 notwithstanding it being a small voice it did pierce them

30
00:01:00,911 --> 00:01:01,638
 that did hear to the center, insomuch that there

31
00:01:01,638 --> 00:01:02,365
 was no part of their frame that it did not cause to

32
00:01:02,365 --> 00:01:03,092
 quake; yea, it did pierce them to the very soul,

33
00:01:03,092 --> 00:01:03,819
 and did cause their hearts to burn

34
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:07,797
4 And it came to pass that again they heard the

35
00:01:07,797 --> 00:01:11,797
 voice, and they understood it not

36
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:18,172
5 And again the third time they did hear the

37
00:01:18,172 --> 00:01:24,572
 voice, and did open their ears to hear it; and their

38
00:01:24,572 --> 00:01:30,972
 eyes were towards the sound thereof; and they did

39
00:01:30,972 --> 00:01:37,372
 look steadfastly towards heaven, from whence the

40
00:01:37,372 --> 00:01:43,772
 sound came

41
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:47,67
6 And behold, the third time they did understand

42
00:01:47,67 --> 00:01:51,67
 the voice which they heard; and it said unto them

43
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:55,645
7 Behold my Beloved Son, in whom I am well

44
00:01:55,645 --> 00:01:59,645
 pleased, in whom I have glorified my name—hear ye him

45
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:00,508
8 And it came to pass, as they understood they

46
00:02:00,508 --> 00:02:01,398
 cast their eyes up again towards heaven; and behold,

47
00:02:01,398 --> 00:02:02,287
 they saw a Man descending out of heaven; and he

48
00:02:02,287 --> 00:02:03,175
 was clothed in a white robe; and he came down and

49
00:02:03,175 --> 00:02:04,065
 stood in the midst of them; and the eyes of the

50
00:02:04,065 --> 00:02:04,954
 whole multitude were turned upon him, and they durst

51
00:02:04,954 --> 00:02:05,843
 not open their mouths, even one to another, and

52
00:02:05,843 --> 00:02:06,731
 wist not what it meant, for they thought it was an

53
00:02:06,731 --> 00:02:07,621
 angel that had appeared unto them

54
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:19,594
9 And it came to pass that he stretched forth his

55
00:02:19,594 --> 00:02:31,594
 hand and spake unto the people, saying

56
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:35,518
10 Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets

57
00:02:35,518 --> 00:02:39,518
 testified shall come into the world

58
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:40,826
11 And behold, I am the light and the life of the

59
00:02:40,826 --> 00:02:42,159
 world; and I have drunk out of that bitter cup

60
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,492
 which the Father hath given me, and have glorified

61
00:02:43,492 --> 00:02:44,825
 the Father in taking upon me the sins of the world,

62
00:02:44,825 --> 00:02:46,158
 in the which I have suffered the will of the

63
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:47,491
 Father in all things from the beginning

64
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,067
12 And it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken

65
00:02:49,067 --> 00:02:50,667
 these words the whole multitude fell to the earth;

66
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:52,267
 for they remembered that it had been prophesied

67
00:02:52,267 --> 00:02:53,867
 among them that Christ should show himself unto

68
00:02:53,867 --> 00:02:55,467
 them after his ascension into heaven

69
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:59,442
13 And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto

70
00:02:59,442 --> 00:03:03,442
 them saying

71
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:04,75
14 Arise and come forth unto me, that ye may

72
00:03:04,75 --> 00:03:06,083
 thrust your hands into my side, and also that ye may

73
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,416
 feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my

74
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:08,749
 feet, that ye may know that I am the God of Israel,

75
00:03:08,749 --> 00:03:10,082
 and the God of the whole earth, and have been

76
00:03:10,082 --> 00:03:11,415
 slain for the sins of the world

77
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:12,28
15 And it came to pass that the multitude went

78
00:03:12,28 --> 00:03:13,169
 forth, and thrust their hands into his side, and did

79
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:14,058
 feel the prints of the nails in his hands and in

80
00:03:14,058 --> 00:03:14,947
 his feet; and this they did do, going forth one by

81
00:03:14,947 --> 00:03:15,836
 one until they had all gone forth, and did see

82
00:03:15,836 --> 00:03:16,725
 with their eyes and did feel with their hands, and

83
00:03:16,725 --> 00:03:17,614
 did know of a surety and did bear record, that it

84
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:18,503
 was he, of whom it was written by the prophets, that

85
00:03:18,503 --> 00:03:19,392
 should come

86
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:24,699
16 And when they had all gone forth and had

87
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:30,032
 witnessed for themselves, they did cry out with one

88
00:03:30,032 --> 00:03:35,365
 accord, saying

89
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:48,648
17 Hosanna! Blessed be the name of the Most High

90
00:03:48,648 --> 00:04:01,981
 God! And they did fall down at the feet of Jesus,

91
00:04:01,981 --> 00:04:15,314
 and did worship him

92
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:20,521
18 And it came to pass that he spake unto Nephi

93
00:04:20,521 --> 00:04:25,854
 (for Nephi was among the multitude) and he commanded

94
00:04:25,854 --> 00:04:31,187
 him that he should come forth

95
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:35,138
19 And Nephi arose and went forth, and bowed

96
00:04:35,138 --> 00:04:39,138
 himself before the Lord and did kiss his feet

97
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:43,112
20 And the Lord commanded him that he should

98
00:04:43,112 --> 00:04:47,112
 arise. And he arose and stood before him

99
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,754
21 And the Lord said unto him: I give unto you

100
00:04:49,754 --> 00:04:52,421
 power that ye shall baptize this people when I am

101
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:55,088
 again ascended into heaven

102
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:58,261
22 And again the Lord called others, and said unto

103
00:04:58,261 --> 00:05:01,461
 them likewise; and he gave unto them power to

104
00:05:01,461 --> 00:05:04,661
 baptize. And he said unto them: On this wise shall ye

105
00:05:04,661 --> 00:05:07,861
 baptize; and there shall be no disputations among

106
00:05:07,861 --> 00:05:11,061
 you

107
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:14,011
23 Verily I say unto you, that whoso repenteth of

108
00:05:14,011 --> 00:05:17,011
 his sins through your words, and desireth to be

109
00:05:17,011 --> 00:05:20,011
 baptized in my name, on this wise shall ye baptize

110
00:05:20,011 --> 00:05:23,011
 them—Behold, ye shall go down and stand in the

111
00:05:23,011 --> 00:05:26,011
 water, and in my name shall ye baptize them

112
00:05:26,96 --> 00:05:34,96
24 And now behold, these are the words which ye

113
00:05:34,96 --> 00:05:42,96
 shall say, calling them by name, saying

114
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:45,576
25 Having authority given me of Jesus Christ, I

115
00:05:45,576 --> 00:05:48,243
 baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the

116
00:05:48,243 --> 00:05:50,91
 Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen

117
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:54,884
26 And then shall ye immerse them in the water,

118
00:05:54,884 --> 00:05:58,884
 and come forth again out of the water

119
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:03,659
27 And after this manner shall ye baptize in my

120
00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:08,459
 name; for behold, verily I say unto you, that the

121
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:13,258
 Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost are one; and

122
00:06:13,258 --> 00:06:18,058
 I am in the Father, and the Father in me, and the

123
00:06:18,058 --> 00:06:22,858
 Father and I are one

124
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,115
28 And according as I have commanded you thus

125
00:06:24,115 --> 00:06:25,448
 shall ye baptize. And there shall be no disputations

126
00:06:25,448 --> 00:06:26,781
 among you, as there have hitherto been; neither

127
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:28,114
 shall there be disputations among you concerning the

128
00:06:28,114 --> 00:06:29,447
 points of my doctrine, as there have hitherto

129
00:06:29,447 --> 00:06:30,78
 been

130
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,357
29 For verily, verily I say unto you, he that hath

131
00:06:32,357 --> 00:06:33,957
 the spirit of contention is not of me, but is of

132
00:06:33,957 --> 00:06:35,557
 the devil, who is the father of contention, and he

133
00:06:35,557 --> 00:06:37,157
 stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with

134
00:06:37,157 --> 00:06:38,757
 anger, one with another

135
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,732
30 Behold, this is not my doctrine, to stir up the

136
00:06:40,732 --> 00:06:42,732
 hearts of men with anger, one against another;

137
00:06:42,732 --> 00:06:44,732
 but this is my doctrine, that such things should be

138
00:06:44,732 --> 00:06:46,732
 done away

139
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:50,706
31 Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, I will

140
00:06:50,706 --> 00:06:54,706
 declare unto you my doctrine

141
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:55,824
32 And this is my doctrine, and it is the doctrine

142
00:06:55,824 --> 00:06:56,967
 which the Father hath given unto me; and I bear

143
00:06:56,967 --> 00:06:58,11
 record of the Father, and the Father beareth record

144
00:06:58,11 --> 00:06:59,253
 of me, and the Holy Ghost beareth record of the

145
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:00,396
 Father and me; and I bear record that the Father

146
00:07:00,396 --> 00:07:01,539
 commandeth all men, everywhere, to repent and

147
00:07:01,539 --> 00:07:02,682
 believe in me

148
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:05,323
33 And whoso believeth in me, and is baptized, the

149
00:07:05,323 --> 00:07:07,99
 same shall be saved; and they are they who shall

150
00:07:07,99 --> 00:07:10,657
 inherit the kingdom of God

151
00:07:10,63 --> 00:07:18,63
34 And whoso believeth not in me, and is not

152
00:07:18,63 --> 00:07:26,63
 baptized, shall be damned

153
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:29,246
35 Verily, verily, I say unto you, that this is my

154
00:07:29,246 --> 00:07:31,913
 doctrine, and I bear record of it from the

155
00:07:31,913 --> 00:07:34,58
 Father; and whoso believeth in me believeth in the

156
00:07:34,58 --> 00:07:37,247
 Father also; and unto him will the Father bear record

157
00:07:37,247 --> 00:07:39,914
 of me, for he will visit him with fire and with the

158
00:07:39,914 --> 00:07:42,581
 Holy Ghost

159
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:46,529
36 And thus will the Father bear record of me, and

160
00:07:46,529 --> 00:07:50,529
 the Holy Ghost will bear record unto him of the

161
00:07:50,529 --> 00:07:54,529
 Father and me; for the Father, and I, and the Holy

162
00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:58,529
 Ghost are one

163
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,145
37 And again I say unto you, ye must repent, and

164
00:08:01,145 --> 00:08:03,812
 become as a little child, and be baptized in my

165
00:08:03,812 --> 00:08:06,479
 name, or ye can in nowise receive these things

166
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:08,453
38 And again I say unto you, ye must repent, and

167
00:08:08,453 --> 00:08:10,453
 be baptized in my name, and become as a little

168
00:08:10,453 --> 00:08:12,453
 child, or ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God

169
00:08:12,453 --> 00:08:14,453


170
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:16,427
39 Verily, verily, I say unto you, that this is my

171
00:08:16,427 --> 00:08:18,427
 doctrine, and whoso buildeth upon this buildeth

172
00:08:18,427 --> 00:08:20,427
 upon my rock, and the gates of hell shall not

173
00:08:20,427 --> 00:08:22,427
 prevail against them

174
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:23,735
40 And whoso shall declare more or less than this,

175
00:08:23,735 --> 00:08:25,068
 and establish it for my doctrine, the same cometh

176
00:08:25,068 --> 00:08:26,401
 of evil, and is not built upon my rock; but he

177
00:08:26,401 --> 00:08:27,734
 buildeth upon a sandy foundation, and the gates of

178
00:08:27,734 --> 00:08:29,067
 hell stand open to receive such when the floods

179
00:08:29,067 --> 00:08:30,4
 come and the winds beat upon them

180
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:31,044
41 Therefore, go forth unto this people, and

181
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:31,711
 declare the words which I have spoken, unto the ends of

182
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:32,378
 the earth.
