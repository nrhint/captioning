1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Jesus Christ did show himself unto the people of

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Nephi, as the multitude were gathered together in

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the land Bountiful, and did minister unto them;

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and on this wise did he show himself unto them.

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Comprising chapters 11 through 26.Chapter 11 The

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Father testifies of His Beloved Son—Christ appears

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and proclaims His Atonement—The people feel the

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
wound marks in His hands and feet and side—They

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
cry Hosanna—He sets forth the mode and manner of

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
baptism—The spirit of contention is of the

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
devil—Christ’s doctrine is that men should believe and

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:19:41,
be baptized and receive the Holy Ghost. About A.D. 34. 

13
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:41,0
1 And now it came to pass that there were

14
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:41,0
a great multitude gathered together, of

15
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:41,0
the people of Nephi, round about the temple

16
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:41,0
which was in the land Bountiful; and they

17
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:41,0
were marveling and wondering one with

18
00:19:41,0 --> 00:19:41,0
another, and were showing one to another the

19
00:19:41,0 --> 00:26:07,
great and marvelous change which had taken place.

20
00:26:07,0 --> 00:26:07,0
2 And they were also conversing

21
00:26:07,0 --> 00:26:07,0
about this Jesus Christ, of whom the

22
00:26:07,0 --> 00:33:50,
sign had been given concerning his death.

23
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
3 And it came to pass that while

24
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
they were thus conversing one with

25
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
another, they heard a voice as if it

26
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
came out of heaven; and they cast

27
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
their eyes round about, for they

28
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
understood not the voice which they

29
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
heard; and it was not a harsh voice,

30
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
neither was it a loud voice;

31
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
nevertheless, and notwithstanding it

32
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
being a small voice it did pierce them

33
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
that did hear to the center,

34
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
insomuch that there was no part of their

35
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
frame that it did not cause to

36
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
quake; yea, it did pierce them to the

37
00:33:50,0 --> 00:48:57,
very soul, and did cause their hearts to burn.

38
00:48:57,0 --> 00:48:57,0
4 And it came to pass that

39
00:48:57,0 --> 00:48:57,0
again they heard the voice,

40
00:48:57,0 --> 00:50:09,
and they understood it not.

41
00:50:09,0 --> 00:50:09,0
5 And again the third time

42
00:50:09,0 --> 00:50:09,0
they did hear the voice,

43
00:50:09,0 --> 00:50:09,0
and did open their ears to

44
00:50:09,0 --> 00:50:09,0
hear it; and their eyes

45
00:50:09,0 --> 00:50:09,0
were towards the sound

46
00:50:09,0 --> 00:50:09,0
thereof; and they did look

47
00:50:09,0 --> 00:50:09,0
steadfastly towards heaven,

48
00:50:09,0 --> 00:49:41,
from whence the sound came.

49
00:49:41,0 --> 00:49:41,0
6 And behold, the third

50
00:49:41,0 --> 00:49:41,0
time they did understand

51
00:49:41,0 --> 00:49:41,0
the voice which they

52
00:49:41,0 --> 00:49:13,
heard; and it said unto them:

53
00:49:13,0 --> 00:49:13,0
7 Behold my Beloved

54
00:49:13,0 --> 00:49:13,0
Son, in whom I am

55
00:49:13,0 --> 00:49:13,0
well pleased, in

56
00:49:13,0 --> 00:49:13,0
whom I have glorified

57
00:49:13,0 --> 00:50:25,
my name—hear ye him.

58
00:50:25,0 --> 00:50:25,0
8 And it came to

59
00:50:25,0 --> 00:50:25,0
pass, as they

60
00:50:25,0 --> 00:50:25,0
understood they cast

61
00:50:25,0 --> 00:50:25,0
their eyes up again

62
00:50:25,0 --> 00:50:25,0
towards heaven;

63
00:50:25,0 --> 00:50:25,0
and behold, they saw

64
00:50:25,0 --> 00:50:25,0
a Man descending

65
00:50:25,0 --> 00:50:25,0
out of heaven; and

66
00:50:25,0 --> 00:50:25,0
he was clothed in

67
00:50:25,0 --> 00:50:25,0
a white robe; and

68
00:50:25,0 --> 00:50:25,0
he came down and

69
00:50:25,0 --> 00:50:25,0
stood in the midst

70
00:50:25,0 --> 00:50:25,0
of them; and the

71
00:50:25,0 --> 00:50:25,0
eyes of the whole

72
00:50:25,0 --> 00:50:25,0
multitude were

73
00:50:25,0 --> 00:50:25,0
turned upon him, and

74
00:50:25,0 --> 00:50:25,0
they durst not

75
00:50:25,0 --> 00:50:25,0
open their mouths,

76
00:50:25,0 --> 00:50:25,0
even one to another,

77
00:50:25,0 --> 00:50:25,0
and wist not what

78
00:50:25,0 --> 00:50:25,0
it meant, for

79
00:50:25,0 --> 00:50:25,0
they thought it was

80
00:50:25,0 --> 01:01:04,
an angel that had appeared unto them.

81
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
9 And it came to

82
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
pass that he

83
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
stretched forth his

84
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
hand and spake

85
01:01:04,0 --> 01:06:15,
unto the people, saying:

86
01:06:15,0 --> 01:06:15,0
10 Behold, I am

87
01:06:15,0 --> 01:06:15,0
Jesus Christ,

88
01:06:15,0 --> 01:06:15,0
whom the prophets

89
01:06:15,0 --> 01:06:15,0
testified shall

90
01:06:15,0 --> 01:11:25,
come into the world.

91
01:11:25,0 --> 01:11:25,0
11 And behold,

92
01:11:25,0 --> 01:11:25,0
I am the light

93
01:11:25,0 --> 01:11:25,0
and the life of

94
01:11:25,0 --> 01:11:25,0
the world; and

95
01:11:25,0 --> 01:11:25,0
I have drunk

96
01:11:25,0 --> 01:11:25,0
out of that

97
01:11:25,0 --> 01:11:25,0
bitter cup which

98
01:11:25,0 --> 01:11:25,0
the Father hath

99
01:11:25,0 --> 01:11:25,0
given me, and

100
01:11:25,0 --> 01:11:25,0
have glorified

101
01:11:25,0 --> 01:11:25,0
the Father in

102
01:11:25,0 --> 01:11:25,0
taking upon me the

103
01:11:25,0 --> 01:11:25,0
sins of the

104
01:11:25,0 --> 01:11:25,0
world, in the

105
01:11:25,0 --> 01:11:25,0
which I have

106
01:11:25,0 --> 01:11:25,0
suffered the will of

107
01:11:25,0 --> 01:11:25,0
the Father in

108
01:11:25,0 --> 01:11:11,
all things from the beginning.

109
01:11:11,0 --> 01:11:11,0
12 And it came

110
01:11:11,0 --> 01:11:11,0
to pass that

111
01:11:11,0 --> 01:11:11,0
when Jesus had

112
01:11:11,0 --> 01:11:11,0
spoken these

113
01:11:11,0 --> 01:11:11,0
words the

114
01:11:11,0 --> 01:11:11,0
whole multitude

115
01:11:11,0 --> 01:11:11,0
fell to the

116
01:11:11,0 --> 01:11:11,0
earth; for they

117
01:11:11,0 --> 01:11:11,0
remembered that

118
01:11:11,0 --> 01:11:11,0
it had been

119
01:11:11,0 --> 01:11:11,0
prophesied among

120
01:11:11,0 --> 01:11:11,0
them that

121
01:11:11,0 --> 01:11:11,0
Christ should

122
01:11:11,0 --> 01:11:11,0
show himself unto

123
01:11:11,0 --> 01:11:11,0
them after

124
01:11:11,0 --> 01:20:20,
his ascension into heaven.

125
01:20:20,0 --> 01:20:20,0
13 And it

126
01:20:20,0 --> 01:20:20,0
came to pass

127
01:20:20,0 --> 01:20:20,0
that the Lord

128
01:20:20,0 --> 01:20:20,0
spake unto

129
01:20:20,0 --> 01:25:30,
them saying:

130
01:25:30,0 --> 01:25:30,0
14 Arise

131
01:25:30,0 --> 01:25:30,0
and come

132
01:25:30,0 --> 01:25:30,0
forth unto me,

133
01:25:30,0 --> 01:25:30,0
that ye may

134
01:25:30,0 --> 01:25:30,0
thrust

135
01:25:30,0 --> 01:25:30,0
your hands

136
01:25:30,0 --> 01:25:30,0
into my side,

137
01:25:30,0 --> 01:25:30,0
and also

138
01:25:30,0 --> 01:25:30,0
that ye may

139
01:25:30,0 --> 01:25:30,0
feel the

140
01:25:30,0 --> 01:25:30,0
prints of the

141
01:25:30,0 --> 01:25:30,0
nails in my

142
01:25:30,0 --> 01:25:30,0
hands and

143
01:25:30,0 --> 01:25:30,0
in my feet,

144
01:25:30,0 --> 01:25:30,0
that ye

145
01:25:30,0 --> 01:25:30,0
may know that

146
01:25:30,0 --> 01:25:30,0
I am the

147
01:25:30,0 --> 01:25:30,0
God of

148
01:25:30,0 --> 01:25:30,0
Israel, and the

149
01:25:30,0 --> 01:25:30,0
God of the

150
01:25:30,0 --> 01:25:30,0
whole

151
01:25:30,0 --> 01:25:30,0
earth, and have

152
01:25:30,0 --> 01:25:30,0
been slain

153
01:25:30,0 --> 01:30:12,
for the sins of the world.

154
01:30:12,0 --> 01:30:12,0
15 And it

155
01:30:12,0 --> 01:30:12,0
came to

156
01:30:12,0 --> 01:30:12,0
pass that

157
01:30:12,0 --> 01:30:12,0
the

158
01:30:12,0 --> 01:30:12,0
multitude went

159
01:30:12,0 --> 01:30:12,0
forth, and

160
01:30:12,0 --> 01:30:12,0
thrust their

161
01:30:12,0 --> 01:30:12,0
hands

162
01:30:12,0 --> 01:30:12,0
into his

163
01:30:12,0 --> 01:30:12,0
side, and did

164
01:30:12,0 --> 01:30:12,0
feel the

165
01:30:12,0 --> 01:30:12,0
prints of

166
01:30:12,0 --> 01:30:12,0
the nails

167
01:30:12,0 --> 01:30:12,0
in his

168
01:30:12,0 --> 01:30:12,0
hands and in

169
01:30:12,0 --> 01:30:12,0
his feet;

170
01:30:12,0 --> 01:30:12,0
and this

171
01:30:12,0 --> 01:30:12,0
they did do,

172
01:30:12,0 --> 01:30:12,0
going

173
01:30:12,0 --> 01:30:12,0
forth one by

174
01:30:12,0 --> 01:30:12,0
one until

175
01:30:12,0 --> 01:30:12,0
they had

176
01:30:12,0 --> 01:30:12,0
all gone

177
01:30:12,0 --> 01:30:12,0
forth, and

178
01:30:12,0 --> 01:30:12,0
did see

179
01:30:12,0 --> 01:30:12,0
with their

180
01:30:12,0 --> 01:30:12,0
eyes and did

181
01:30:12,0 --> 01:30:12,0
feel with

182
01:30:12,0 --> 01:30:12,0
their

183
01:30:12,0 --> 01:30:12,0
hands, and

184
01:30:12,0 --> 01:30:12,0
did know of

185
01:30:12,0 --> 01:30:12,0
a surety

186
01:30:12,0 --> 01:30:12,0
and did

187
01:30:12,0 --> 01:30:12,0
bear record,

188
01:30:12,0 --> 01:30:12,0
that it

189
01:30:12,0 --> 01:30:12,0
was he, of

190
01:30:12,0 --> 01:30:12,0
whom it was

191
01:30:12,0 --> 01:32:24,
written by the prophets, that should come.

192
01:32:24,0 --> 01:32:24,0
16 And

193
01:32:24,0 --> 01:32:24,0
when they

194
01:32:24,0 --> 01:32:24,0
had all

195
01:32:24,0 --> 01:32:24,0
gone forth

196
01:32:24,0 --> 01:32:24,0
and had

197
01:32:24,0 --> 01:32:24,0
witnessed

198
01:32:24,0 --> 01:32:24,0
for

199
01:32:24,0 --> 01:32:24,0
themselves,

200
01:32:24,0 --> 01:32:24,0
they did

201
01:32:24,0 --> 01:32:24,0
cry out

202
01:32:24,0 --> 01:32:24,0
with one

203
01:32:24,0 --> 01:37:34,
accord, saying:

204
01:37:34,0 --> 01:37:34,0
17

205
01:37:34,0 --> 01:37:34,0
Hosanna!

206
01:37:34,0 --> 01:37:34,0
Blessed be

207
01:37:34,0 --> 01:37:34,0
the name

208
01:37:34,0 --> 01:37:34,0
of the

209
01:37:34,0 --> 01:37:34,0
Most High

210
01:37:34,0 --> 01:37:34,0
God!

211
01:37:34,0 --> 01:37:34,0
And they

212
01:37:34,0 --> 01:37:34,0
did fall

213
01:37:34,0 --> 01:37:34,0
down at

214
01:37:34,0 --> 01:37:34,0
the feet

215
01:37:34,0 --> 01:37:34,0
of

216
01:37:34,0 --> 01:37:34,0
Jesus, and

217
01:37:34,0 --> 01:43:45,
did worship him.

218
01:43:45,0 --> 01:43:45,0
18 And

219
01:43:45,0 --> 01:43:45,0
it came

220
01:43:45,0 --> 01:43:45,0
to

221
01:43:45,0 --> 01:43:45,0
pass that

222
01:43:45,0 --> 01:43:45,0
