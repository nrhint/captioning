1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 21 Israel will be gathered when the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Book of Mormon comes forth—The Gentiles will

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
be established as a free people in

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
America—They will be saved if they believe and obey;

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
otherwise, they will be cut off and

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
destroyed—Israel will build the New Jerusalem, and

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:11:43,
the lost tribes will return. About A.D. 34. 

8
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
1 And verily I say unto you, I give unto

9
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
you a sign, that ye may know the time when

10
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
these things shall be about to take

11
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
place—that I shall gather in, from their long

12
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
dispersion, my people, O house of Israel,

13
00:11:43,0 --> 00:16:54,
and shall establish again among them my Zion;

14
00:16:54,0 --> 00:16:54,0
2 And behold, this is the thing which

15
00:16:54,0 --> 00:16:54,0
I will give unto you for a sign—for

16
00:16:54,0 --> 00:16:54,0
verily I say unto you that when these

17
00:16:54,0 --> 00:16:54,0
things which I declare unto you, and

18
00:16:54,0 --> 00:16:54,0
which I shall declare unto you hereafter

19
00:16:54,0 --> 00:16:54,0
of myself, and by the power of the

20
00:16:54,0 --> 00:16:54,0
Holy Ghost which shall be given unto you

21
00:16:54,0 --> 00:16:54,0
of the Father, shall be made known

22
00:16:54,0 --> 00:16:54,0
unto the Gentiles that they may know

23
00:16:54,0 --> 00:16:54,0
concerning this people who are a remnant

24
00:16:54,0 --> 00:16:54,0
of the house of Jacob, and concerning

25
00:16:54,0 --> 00:20:24,
this my people who shall be scattered by them;

26
00:20:24,0 --> 00:20:24,0
3 Verily, verily, I say unto you, when

27
00:20:24,0 --> 00:20:24,0
these things shall be made known unto

28
00:20:24,0 --> 00:20:24,0
them of the Father, and shall come

29
00:20:24,0 --> 00:24:23,
forth of the Father, from them unto you;

30
00:24:23,0 --> 00:24:23,0
4 For it is wisdom in the Father

31
00:24:23,0 --> 00:24:23,0
that they should be established in

32
00:24:23,0 --> 00:24:23,0
this land, and be set up as a free

33
00:24:23,0 --> 00:24:23,0
people by the power of the Father,

34
00:24:23,0 --> 00:24:23,0
that these things might come forth

35
00:24:23,0 --> 00:24:23,0
from them unto a remnant of your

36
00:24:23,0 --> 00:24:23,0
seed, that the covenant of the Father

37
00:24:23,0 --> 00:24:23,0
may be fulfilled which he hath

38
00:24:23,0 --> 00:31:31,
covenanted with his people, O house of Israel;

39
00:31:31,0 --> 00:31:31,0
5 Therefore, when these works

40
00:31:31,0 --> 00:31:31,0
and the works which shall be

41
00:31:31,0 --> 00:31:31,0
wrought among you hereafter shall

42
00:31:31,0 --> 00:31:31,0
come forth from the Gentiles,

43
00:31:31,0 --> 00:31:31,0
unto your seed which shall

44
00:31:31,0 --> 00:33:43,
dwindle in unbelief because of iniquity;

45
00:33:43,0 --> 00:33:43,0
6 For thus it behooveth the

46
00:33:43,0 --> 00:33:43,0
Father that it should come

47
00:33:43,0 --> 00:33:43,0
forth from the Gentiles, that

48
00:33:43,0 --> 00:33:43,0
he may show forth his power

49
00:33:43,0 --> 00:33:43,0
unto the Gentiles, for this

50
00:33:43,0 --> 00:33:43,0
cause that the Gentiles, if

51
00:33:43,0 --> 00:33:43,0
they will not harden their

52
00:33:43,0 --> 00:33:43,0
hearts, that they may repent

53
00:33:43,0 --> 00:33:43,0
and come unto me and be

54
00:33:43,0 --> 00:33:43,0
baptized in my name and know of

55
00:33:43,0 --> 00:33:43,0
the true points of my

56
00:33:43,0 --> 00:33:43,0
doctrine, that they may be

57
00:33:43,0 --> 00:33:57,
numbered among my people, O house of Israel;

58
00:33:57,0 --> 00:33:57,0
7 And when these things

59
00:33:57,0 --> 00:33:57,0
come to pass that thy seed

60
00:33:57,0 --> 00:33:57,0
shall begin to know these

61
00:33:57,0 --> 00:33:57,0
things—it shall be a sign

62
00:33:57,0 --> 00:33:57,0
unto them, that they may

63
00:33:57,0 --> 00:33:57,0
know that the work of the

64
00:33:57,0 --> 00:33:57,0
Father hath already

65
00:33:57,0 --> 00:33:57,0
commenced unto the fulfilling of

66
00:33:57,0 --> 00:33:57,0
the covenant which he hath

67
00:33:57,0 --> 00:33:57,0
made unto the people who

68
00:33:57,0 --> 00:40:07,
are of the house of Israel.

69
00:40:07,0 --> 00:40:07,0
8 And when that day

70
00:40:07,0 --> 00:40:07,0
shall come, it shall come to

71
00:40:07,0 --> 00:40:07,0
pass that kings shall

72
00:40:07,0 --> 00:40:07,0
shut their mouths; for

73
00:40:07,0 --> 00:40:07,0
that which had not been

74
00:40:07,0 --> 00:40:07,0
told them shall they see;

75
00:40:07,0 --> 00:40:07,0
and that which they had

76
00:40:07,0 --> 00:39:39,
not heard shall they consider.

77
00:39:39,0 --> 00:39:39,0
9 For in that day, for

78
00:39:39,0 --> 00:39:39,0
my sake shall the

79
00:39:39,0 --> 00:39:39,0
Father work a work, which

80
00:39:39,0 --> 00:39:39,0
shall be a great and

81
00:39:39,0 --> 00:39:39,0
a marvelous work among

82
00:39:39,0 --> 00:39:39,0
them; and there shall

83
00:39:39,0 --> 00:39:39,0
be among them those

84
00:39:39,0 --> 00:39:39,0
who will not believe

85
00:39:39,0 --> 00:39:39,0
it, although a man shall

86
00:39:39,0 --> 00:44:49,
declare it unto them.

87
00:44:49,0 --> 00:44:49,0
10 But behold, the

88
00:44:49,0 --> 00:44:49,0
life of my servant shall

89
00:44:49,0 --> 00:44:49,0
be in my hand;

90
00:44:49,0 --> 00:44:49,0
therefore they shall not hurt

91
00:44:49,0 --> 00:44:49,0
him, although he

92
00:44:49,0 --> 00:44:49,0
shall be marred because of

93
00:44:49,0 --> 00:44:49,0
them. Yet I will heal

94
00:44:49,0 --> 00:44:49,0
him, for I will show

95
00:44:49,0 --> 00:44:49,0
unto them that my

96
00:44:49,0 --> 00:44:49,0
wisdom is greater than the

97
00:44:49,0 --> 00:44:21,
cunning of the devil.

98
00:44:21,0 --> 00:44:21,0
11 Therefore it

99
00:44:21,0 --> 00:44:21,0
shall come to pass that

100
00:44:21,0 --> 00:44:21,0
whosoever will not

101
00:44:21,0 --> 00:44:21,0
believe in my words,

102
00:44:21,0 --> 00:44:21,0
who am Jesus Christ,

103
00:44:21,0 --> 00:44:21,0
which the Father

104
00:44:21,0 --> 00:44:21,0
shall cause him to

105
00:44:21,0 --> 00:44:21,0
bring forth unto the

106
00:44:21,0 --> 00:44:21,0
Gentiles, and shall

107
00:44:21,0 --> 00:44:21,0
give unto him power

108
00:44:21,0 --> 00:44:21,0
that he shall bring

109
00:44:21,0 --> 00:44:21,0
them forth unto the

110
00:44:21,0 --> 00:44:21,0
Gentiles, (it shall be

111
00:44:21,0 --> 00:44:21,0
done even as Moses

112
00:44:21,0 --> 00:44:21,0
said) they shall be

113
00:44:21,0 --> 00:44:21,0
cut off from among

114
00:44:21,0 --> 00:47:51,
my people who are of the covenant.

115
00:47:51,0 --> 00:47:51,0
12 And my people

116
00:47:51,0 --> 00:47:51,0
who are a remnant of

117
00:47:51,0 --> 00:47:51,0
Jacob shall be

118
00:47:51,0 --> 00:47:51,0
among the Gentiles,

119
00:47:51,0 --> 00:47:51,0
yea, in the midst of

120
00:47:51,0 --> 00:47:51,0
them as a lion among

121
00:47:51,0 --> 00:47:51,0
the beasts of the

122
00:47:51,0 --> 00:47:51,0
forest, as a young

123
00:47:51,0 --> 00:47:51,0
lion among the

124
00:47:51,0 --> 00:47:51,0
flocks of sheep, who,

125
00:47:51,0 --> 00:47:51,0
if he go through

126
00:47:51,0 --> 00:47:51,0
both treadeth down and

127
00:47:51,0 --> 00:47:51,0
teareth in pieces,

128
00:47:51,0 --> 01:05:59,
and none can deliver.

129
01:05:59,0 --> 01:05:59,0
13 Their hand

130
01:05:59,0 --> 01:05:59,0
shall be lifted up

131
01:05:59,0 --> 01:05:59,0
upon their

132
01:05:59,0 --> 01:05:59,0
adversaries, and all

133
01:05:59,0 --> 01:05:59,0
their enemies

134
01:05:59,0 --> 01:14:11,
shall be cut off.

135
01:14:11,0 --> 01:14:11,0
14 Yea, wo be

136
01:14:11,0 --> 01:14:11,0
unto the

137
01:14:11,0 --> 01:14:11,0
Gentiles except they

138
01:14:11,0 --> 01:14:11,0
repent; for it

139
01:14:11,0 --> 01:14:11,0
shall come to

140
01:14:11,0 --> 01:14:11,0
pass in that day,

141
01:14:11,0 --> 01:14:11,0
saith the

142
01:14:11,0 --> 01:14:11,0
Father, that I will

143
01:14:11,0 --> 01:14:11,0
cut off thy

144
01:14:11,0 --> 01:14:11,0
horses out of the

145
01:14:11,0 --> 01:14:11,0
midst of thee,

146
01:14:11,0 --> 01:14:11,0
and I will

147
01:14:11,0 --> 01:20:52,
destroy thy chariots;

148
01:20:52,0 --> 01:20:52,0
15 And I will

149
01:20:52,0 --> 01:20:52,0
cut off the

150
01:20:52,0 --> 01:20:52,0
cities of thy

151
01:20:52,0 --> 01:20:52,0
land, and

152
01:20:52,0 --> 01:20:52,0
throw down all

153
01:20:52,0 --> 01:31:01,
thy strongholds;

154
01:31:01,0 --> 01:31:01,0
16 And I will

155
01:31:01,0 --> 01:31:01,0
cut off

156
01:31:01,0 --> 01:31:01,0
witchcrafts out

157
01:31:01,0 --> 01:31:01,0
of thy land,

158
01:31:01,0 --> 01:31:01,0
and thou shalt

159
01:31:01,0 --> 01:31:01,0
have no more

160
01:31:01,0 --> 01:34:32,
soothsayers;

161
01:34:32,0 --> 01:34:32,0
17 Thy

162
01:34:32,0 --> 01:34:32,0
graven images I

163
01:34:32,0 --> 01:34:32,0
will also cut

164
01:34:32,0 --> 01:34:32,0
off, and

165
01:34:32,0 --> 01:34:32,0
thy standing

166
01:34:32,0 --> 01:34:32,0
images out of

167
01:34:32,0 --> 01:34:32,0
the midst

168
01:34:32,0 --> 01:34:32,0
of thee, and

169
01:34:32,0 --> 01:34:32,0
thou shalt

170
01:34:32,0 --> 01:34:32,0
no more

171
01:34:32,0 --> 01:34:32,0
worship the works

172
01:34:32,0 --> 01:38:03,
of thy hands;

173
01:38:03,0 --> 01:38:03,0
18 And I

174
01:38:03,0 --> 01:38:03,0
will pluck up

175
01:38:03,0 --> 01:38:03,0
thy groves

176
01:38:03,0 --> 01:38:03,0
out of the

177
01:38:03,0 --> 01:38:03,0
midst of

178
01:38:03,0 --> 01:38:03,0
thee; so

179
01:38:03,0 --> 01:38:03,0
will I destroy

180
01:38:03,0 --> 01:43:13,
thy cities.

181
01:43:13,0 --> 01:43:13,0
19 And it

182
01:43:13,0 --> 01:43:13,0
shall come

183
01:43:13,0 --> 01:43:13,0
to pass

184
01:43:13,0 --> 01:43:13,0
that all

185
01:43:13,0 --> 01:43:13,0
lyings, and

186
01:43:13,0 --> 01:43:13,0


187
01:43:13,0 --> 01:43:13,0
deceivings, and

188
01:43:13,0 --> 01:43:13,0
envyings, and

189
01:43:13,0 --> 01:43:13,0
strifes,

190
01:43:13,0 --> 01:43:13,0
and

191
01:43:13,0 --> 01:43:13,0
priestcrafts, and

192
01:43:13,0 --> 01:43:13,0


193
01:43:13,0 --> 01:48:23,
whoredoms, shall be done away.

194
01:48:23,0 --> 01:48:23,0
20 For it

195
01:48:23,0 --> 01:48:23,0
shall

196
01:48:23,0 --> 01:48:23,0
come to

197
01:48:23,0 --> 01:48:23,0
pass, saith

198
01:48:23,0 --> 01:48:23,0
the

199
01:48:23,0 --> 01:48:23,0
Father, that

200
01:48:23,0 --> 01:48:23,0
at that

201
01:48:23,0 --> 01:48:23,0
day

202
01:48:23,0 --> 01:48:23,0
whosoever will

203
01:48:23,0 --> 01:48:23,0
not repent

204
01:48:23,0 --> 01:48:23,0
and come

205
01:48:23,0 --> 01:48:23,0
unto my

206
01:48:23,0 --> 01:48:23,0
Beloved

207
01:48:23,0 --> 01:48:23,0
Son, them

208
01:48:23,0 --> 01:48:23,0
will I

209
01:48:23,0 --> 01:48:23,0
cut off

210
01:48:23,0 --> 01:48:23,0
from among

211
01:48:23,0 --> 01:48:23,0
my people,

212
01:48:23,0 --> 02:01:31,
O house of Israel;

213
02:01:31,0 --> 02:01:31,0
21 And I

214
02:01:31,0 --> 02:01:31,0
will

215
02:01:31,0 --> 02:01:31,0
execute

216
02:01:31,0 --> 02:01:31,0
vengeance

217
02:01:31,0 --> 02:01:31,0
and fury

218
02:01:31,0 --> 02:01:31,0
upon
