1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:03,143
Chapter 21 Israel will be gathered when the

2
00:00:03,143 --> 00:00:06,286
Book of Mormon comes forth—The Gentiles will

3
00:00:06,286 --> 00:00:09,429
be established as a free people in

4
00:00:09,429 --> 00:00:12,572
America—They will be saved if they believe and obey;

5
00:00:12,572 --> 00:00:15,715
otherwise, they will be cut off and

6
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:18,858
destroyed—Israel will build the New Jerusalem, and

7
00:00:18,858 --> 00:00:22,256
the lost tribes will return. About A.D. 34. 

8
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:26,089
1 And verily I say unto you, I give unto

9
00:00:26,089 --> 00:00:29,922
you a sign, that ye may know the time when

10
00:00:29,922 --> 00:00:33,755
these things shall be about to take

11
00:00:33,755 --> 00:00:37,588
place—that I shall gather in, from their long

12
00:00:37,588 --> 00:00:41,421
dispersion, my people, O house of Israel,

13
00:00:41,421 --> 00:00:45,679
and shall establish again among them my Zion;

14
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:45,929
2 And behold, this is the thing which

15
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:46,179
I will give unto you for a sign—for

16
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:46,429
verily I say unto you that when these

17
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:46,679
things which I declare unto you, and

18
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:46,929
which I shall declare unto you hereafter

19
00:00:46,929 --> 00:00:47,179
of myself, and by the power of the

20
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:47,429
Holy Ghost which shall be given unto you

21
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:47,679
of the Father, shall be made known

22
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:47,929
unto the Gentiles that they may know

23
00:00:47,929 --> 00:00:48,179
concerning this people who are a remnant

24
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:48,429
of the house of Jacob, and concerning

25
00:00:48,429 --> 00:00:48,081
this my people who shall be scattered by them;

26
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:47,831
3 Verily, verily, I say unto you, when

27
00:00:47,831 --> 00:00:47,581
these things shall be made known unto

28
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:47,331
them of the Father, and shall come

29
00:00:47,331 --> 00:00:47,147
forth of the Father, from them unto you;

30
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:47,036
4 For it is wisdom in the Father

31
00:00:47,036 --> 00:00:46,925
that they should be established in

32
00:00:46,925 --> 00:00:46,814
this land, and be set up as a free

33
00:00:46,814 --> 00:00:46,703
people by the power of the Father,

34
00:00:46,703 --> 00:00:46,592
that these things might come forth

35
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:46,481
from them unto a remnant of your

36
00:00:46,481 --> 00:00:46,37
seed, that the covenant of the Father

37
00:00:46,37 --> 00:00:46,259
may be fulfilled which he hath

38
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:46,213
covenanted with his people, O house of Israel;

39
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:46,88
5 Therefore, when these works

40
00:00:46,88 --> 00:00:47,547
and the works which shall be

41
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:48,214
wrought among you hereafter shall

42
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:48,881
come forth from the Gentiles,

43
00:00:48,881 --> 00:00:49,548
unto your seed which shall

44
00:00:49,548 --> 00:00:50,617
dwindle in unbelief because of iniquity;

45
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:52,925
6 For thus it behooveth the

46
00:00:52,925 --> 00:00:55,233
Father that it should come

47
00:00:55,233 --> 00:00:57,541
forth from the Gentiles, that

48
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:59,849
he may show forth his power

49
00:00:59,849 --> 00:01:02,157
unto the Gentiles, for this

50
00:01:02,157 --> 00:01:04,465
cause that the Gentiles, if

51
00:01:04,465 --> 00:01:06,773
they will not harden their

52
00:01:06,773 --> 00:01:09,081
hearts, that they may repent

53
00:01:09,081 --> 00:01:11,389
and come unto me and be

54
00:01:11,389 --> 00:01:13,697
baptized in my name and know of

55
00:01:13,697 --> 00:01:16,005
the true points of my

56
00:01:16,005 --> 00:01:18,313
doctrine, that they may be

57
00:01:18,313 --> 00:01:20,414
numbered among my people, O house of Israel;

58
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:21,141
7 And when these things

59
00:01:21,141 --> 00:01:21,868
come to pass that thy seed

60
00:01:21,868 --> 00:01:22,595
shall begin to know these

61
00:01:22,595 --> 00:01:23,322
things—it shall be a sign

62
00:01:23,322 --> 00:01:24,049
unto them, that they may

63
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:24,776
know that the work of the

64
00:01:24,776 --> 00:01:25,503
Father hath already

65
00:01:25,503 --> 00:01:26,23
commenced unto the fulfilling of

66
00:01:26,23 --> 00:01:26,957
the covenant which he hath

67
00:01:26,957 --> 00:01:27,684
made unto the people who

68
00:01:27,684 --> 00:01:28,355
are of the house of Israel.

69
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:31,105
8 And when that day

70
00:01:31,105 --> 00:01:33,855
shall come, it shall come to

71
00:01:33,855 --> 00:01:36,605
pass that kings shall

72
00:01:36,605 --> 00:01:39,355
shut their mouths; for

73
00:01:39,355 --> 00:01:42,105
that which had not been

74
00:01:42,105 --> 00:01:44,855
told them shall they see;

75
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:47,605
and that which they had

76
00:01:47,605 --> 00:01:50,143
not heard shall they consider.

77
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:52,443
9 For in that day, for

78
00:01:52,443 --> 00:01:54,743
my sake shall the

79
00:01:54,743 --> 00:01:57,043
Father work a work, which

80
00:01:57,043 --> 00:01:59,343
shall be a great and

81
00:01:59,343 --> 00:02:01,643
a marvelous work among

82
00:02:01,643 --> 00:02:03,943
them; and there shall

83
00:02:03,943 --> 00:02:06,243
be among them those

84
00:02:06,243 --> 00:02:08,543
who will not believe

85
00:02:08,543 --> 00:02:10,843
it, although a man shall

86
00:02:10,843 --> 00:02:13,133
declare it unto them.

87
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,588
10 But behold, the

88
00:02:14,588 --> 00:02:16,043
life of my servant shall

89
00:02:16,043 --> 00:02:17,498
be in my hand;

90
00:02:17,498 --> 00:02:18,953
therefore they shall not hurt

91
00:02:18,953 --> 00:02:20,408
him, although he

92
00:02:20,408 --> 00:02:21,863
shall be marred because of

93
00:02:21,863 --> 00:02:23,318
them. Yet I will heal

94
00:02:23,318 --> 00:02:24,773
him, for I will show

95
00:02:24,773 --> 00:02:26,228
unto them that my

96
00:02:26,228 --> 00:02:27,683
wisdom is greater than the

97
00:02:27,683 --> 00:02:29,082
cunning of the devil.

98
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:29,67
11 Therefore it

99
00:02:29,67 --> 00:02:30,258
shall come to pass that

100
00:02:30,258 --> 00:02:30,846
whosoever will not

101
00:02:30,846 --> 00:02:31,434
believe in my words,

102
00:02:31,434 --> 00:02:32,022
who am Jesus Christ,

103
00:02:32,022 --> 00:02:32,61
which the Father

104
00:02:32,61 --> 00:02:33,198
shall cause him to

105
00:02:33,198 --> 00:02:33,786
bring forth unto the

106
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:34,374
Gentiles, and shall

107
00:02:34,374 --> 00:02:34,962
give unto him power

108
00:02:34,962 --> 00:02:35,55
that he shall bring

109
00:02:35,55 --> 00:02:36,138
them forth unto the

110
00:02:36,138 --> 00:02:36,726
Gentiles, (it shall be

111
00:02:36,726 --> 00:02:37,314
done even as Moses

112
00:02:37,314 --> 00:02:37,902
said) they shall be

113
00:02:37,902 --> 00:02:38,49
cut off from among

114
00:02:38,49 --> 00:02:39,426
my people who are of the covenant.

115
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:41,497
12 And my people

116
00:02:41,497 --> 00:02:43,568
who are a remnant of

117
00:02:43,568 --> 00:02:45,639
Jacob shall be

118
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:47,71
among the Gentiles,

119
00:02:47,71 --> 00:02:49,781
yea, in the midst of

120
00:02:49,781 --> 00:02:51,852
them as a lion among

121
00:02:51,852 --> 00:02:53,923
the beasts of the

122
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,994
forest, as a young

123
00:02:55,994 --> 00:02:58,065
lion among the

124
00:02:58,065 --> 00:03:00,136
flocks of sheep, who,

125
00:03:00,136 --> 00:03:02,207
if he go through

126
00:03:02,207 --> 00:03:04,278
both treadeth down and

127
00:03:04,278 --> 00:03:06,349
teareth in pieces,

128
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:08,755
and none can deliver.

129
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:12,755
13 Their hand

130
00:03:12,755 --> 00:03:16,755
shall be lifted up

131
00:03:16,755 --> 00:03:20,755
upon their

132
00:03:20,755 --> 00:03:24,755
adversaries, and all

133
00:03:24,755 --> 00:03:28,755
their enemies

134
00:03:28,755 --> 00:03:32,212
shall be cut off.

135
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,597
14 Yea, wo be

136
00:03:33,597 --> 00:03:34,982
unto the

137
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:36,367
Gentiles except they

138
00:03:36,367 --> 00:03:37,752
repent; for it

139
00:03:37,752 --> 00:03:39,137
shall come to

140
00:03:39,137 --> 00:03:40,522
pass in that day,

141
00:03:40,522 --> 00:03:41,907
saith the

142
00:03:41,907 --> 00:03:43,292
Father, that I will

143
00:03:43,292 --> 00:03:44,677
cut off thy

144
00:03:44,677 --> 00:03:46,062
horses out of the

145
00:03:46,062 --> 00:03:47,447
midst of thee,

146
00:03:47,447 --> 00:03:48,832
and I will

147
00:03:48,832 --> 00:03:50,53
destroy thy chariots;

148
00:03:50,53 --> 00:03:55,863
15 And I will

149
00:03:55,863 --> 00:04:01,196
cut off the

150
00:04:01,196 --> 00:04:06,529
cities of thy

151
00:04:06,529 --> 00:04:11,862
land, and

152
00:04:11,862 --> 00:04:17,195
throw down all

153
00:04:17,195 --> 00:04:22,896
thy strongholds;

154
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:25,039
16 And I will

155
00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:27,182
cut off

156
00:04:27,182 --> 00:04:29,325
witchcrafts out

157
00:04:29,325 --> 00:04:31,468
of thy land,

158
00:04:31,468 --> 00:04:33,611
and thou shalt

159
00:04:33,611 --> 00:04:35,754
have no more

160
00:04:35,754 --> 00:04:37,177
soothsayers;

161
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:39,094
17 Thy

162
00:04:39,094 --> 00:04:41,011
graven images I

163
00:04:41,011 --> 00:04:42,928
will also cut

164
00:04:42,928 --> 00:04:44,845
off, and

165
00:04:44,845 --> 00:04:46,762
thy standing

166
00:04:46,762 --> 00:04:48,679
images out of

167
00:04:48,679 --> 00:04:50,596
the midst

168
00:04:50,596 --> 00:04:52,513
of thee, and

169
00:04:52,513 --> 00:04:54,43
thou shalt

170
00:04:54,43 --> 00:04:56,347
no more

171
00:04:56,347 --> 00:04:58,264
worship the works

172
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:00,634
of thy hands;

173
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,634
18 And I

174
00:05:03,634 --> 00:05:06,634
will pluck up

175
00:05:06,634 --> 00:05:09,634
thy groves

176
00:05:09,634 --> 00:05:12,634
out of the

177
00:05:12,634 --> 00:05:15,634
midst of

178
00:05:15,634 --> 00:05:18,634
thee; so

179
00:05:18,634 --> 00:05:21,634
will I destroy

180
00:05:21,634 --> 00:05:24,558
thy cities.

181
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:26,789
19 And it

182
00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:29,02
shall come

183
00:05:29,02 --> 00:05:31,251
to pass

184
00:05:31,251 --> 00:05:33,482
that all

185
00:05:33,482 --> 00:05:35,713
lyings, and

186
00:05:35,713 --> 00:05:37,944


187
00:05:37,944 --> 00:05:40,175
deceivings, and

188
00:05:40,175 --> 00:05:42,406
envyings, and

189
00:05:42,406 --> 00:05:44,637
strifes,

190
00:05:44,637 --> 00:05:46,868
and

191
00:05:46,868 --> 00:05:49,099
priestcrafts, and

192
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:51,33


193
00:05:51,33 --> 00:05:53,887
whoredoms, shall be done away.

194
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:55,098
20 For it

195
00:05:55,098 --> 00:05:56,309
shall

196
00:05:56,309 --> 00:05:57,52
