1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:03,286
Chapter 21 Israel will be gathered when the Book

2
00:00:03,286 --> 00:00:06,572
 of Mormon comes forth—The Gentiles will be

3
00:00:06,572 --> 00:00:09,858
 established as a free people in America—They will be saved

4
00:00:09,858 --> 00:00:13,144
 if they believe and obey; otherwise, they will be

5
00:00:13,144 --> 00:00:16,43
 cut off and destroyed—Israel will build the New

6
00:00:16,43 --> 00:00:19,716
 Jerusalem, and the lost tribes will return. About

7
00:00:19,716 --> 00:00:23,002
 A.D. 34.

8
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:26,591
1 And verily I say unto you, I give unto you a

9
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:29,258
 sign, that ye may know the time when these things

10
00:00:29,258 --> 00:00:31,925
 shall be about to take place—that I shall gather in,

11
00:00:31,925 --> 00:00:34,592
 from their long dispersion, my people, O house of

12
00:00:34,592 --> 00:00:37,259
 Israel, and shall establish again among them my

13
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:39,926
 Zion

14
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:40,673
2 And behold, this is the thing which I will give

15
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:41,473
 unto you for a sign—for verily I say unto you that

16
00:00:41,473 --> 00:00:42,273
 when these things which I declare unto you, and

17
00:00:42,273 --> 00:00:43,073
 which I shall declare unto you hereafter of myself,

18
00:00:43,073 --> 00:00:43,873
 and by the power of the Holy Ghost which shall be

19
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:44,673
 given unto you of the Father, shall be made known

20
00:00:44,673 --> 00:00:45,473
 unto the Gentiles that they may know concerning

21
00:00:45,473 --> 00:00:46,273
 this people who are a remnant of the house of

22
00:00:46,273 --> 00:00:47,073
 Jacob, and concerning this my people who shall be

23
00:00:47,073 --> 00:00:47,873
 scattered by them

24
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,848
3 Verily, verily, I say unto you, when these

25
00:00:49,848 --> 00:00:51,848
 things shall be made known unto them of the Father, and

26
00:00:51,848 --> 00:00:53,848
 shall come forth of the Father, from them unto

27
00:00:53,848 --> 00:00:55,848
 you

28
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:56,965
4 For it is wisdom in the Father that they should

29
00:00:56,965 --> 00:00:58,108
 be established in this land, and be set up as a

30
00:00:58,108 --> 00:00:59,251
 free people by the power of the Father, that these

31
00:00:59,251 --> 00:01:00,394
 things might come forth from them unto a remnant of

32
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:01,537
 your seed, that the covenant of the Father may be

33
00:01:01,537 --> 00:01:02,68
 fulfilled which he hath covenanted with his

34
00:01:02,68 --> 00:01:03,823
 people, O house of Israel

35
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,797
5 Therefore, when these works and the works which

36
00:01:05,797 --> 00:01:07,797
 shall be wrought among you hereafter shall come

37
00:01:07,797 --> 00:01:09,797
 forth from the Gentiles, unto your seed which shall

38
00:01:09,797 --> 00:01:11,797
 dwindle in unbelief because of iniquity

39
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:12,772
6 For thus it behooveth the Father that it should

40
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:13,772
 come forth from the Gentiles, that he may show

41
00:01:13,772 --> 00:01:14,772
 forth his power unto the Gentiles, for this cause

42
00:01:14,772 --> 00:01:15,772
 that the Gentiles, if they will not harden their

43
00:01:15,772 --> 00:01:16,772
 hearts, that they may repent and come unto me and be

44
00:01:16,772 --> 00:01:17,772
 baptized in my name and know of the true points of

45
00:01:17,772 --> 00:01:18,772
 my doctrine, that they may be numbered among my

46
00:01:18,772 --> 00:01:19,772
 people, O house of Israel

47
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,413
7 And when these things come to pass that thy seed

48
00:01:22,413 --> 00:01:25,08
 shall begin to know these things—it shall be a

49
00:01:25,08 --> 00:01:27,747
 sign unto them, that they may know that the work of

50
00:01:27,747 --> 00:01:30,414
 the Father hath already commenced unto the

51
00:01:30,414 --> 00:01:33,081
 fulfilling of the covenant which he hath made unto the

52
00:01:33,081 --> 00:01:35,748
 people who are of the house of Israel

53
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:41,696
8 And when that day shall come, it shall come to

54
00:01:41,696 --> 00:01:47,696
 pass that kings shall shut their mouths; for that

55
00:01:47,696 --> 00:01:53,696
 which had not been told them shall they see; and

56
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:59,696
 that which they had not heard shall they consider

57
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:02,82
9 For in that day, for my sake shall the Father

58
00:02:02,82 --> 00:02:06,02
 work a work, which shall be a great and a marvelous

59
00:02:06,02 --> 00:02:09,22
 work among them; and there shall be among them

60
00:02:09,22 --> 00:02:12,419
 those who will not believe it, although a man shall

61
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:15,62
 declare it unto them

62
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:18,769
10 But behold, the life of my servant shall be in

63
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:21,969
 my hand; therefore they shall not hurt him,

64
00:02:21,969 --> 00:02:25,169
 although he shall be marred because of them. Yet I will

65
00:02:25,169 --> 00:02:28,369
 heal him, for I will show unto them that my wisdom

66
00:02:28,369 --> 00:02:31,569
 is greater than the cunning of the devil

67
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:32,518
11 Therefore it shall come to pass that whosoever

68
00:02:32,518 --> 00:02:33,518
 will not believe in my words, who am Jesus Christ,

69
00:02:33,518 --> 00:02:34,518
 which the Father shall cause him to bring forth

70
00:02:34,518 --> 00:02:35,518
 unto the Gentiles, and shall give unto him power

71
00:02:35,518 --> 00:02:36,518
 that he shall bring them forth unto the Gentiles,

72
00:02:36,518 --> 00:02:37,518
 (it shall be done even as Moses said) they shall be

73
00:02:37,518 --> 00:02:38,518
 cut off from among my people who are of the

74
00:02:38,518 --> 00:02:39,518
 covenant

75
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:40,826
12 And my people who are a remnant of Jacob shall

76
00:02:40,826 --> 00:02:42,159
 be among the Gentiles, yea, in the midst of them

77
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,492
 as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a

78
00:02:43,492 --> 00:02:44,825
 young lion among the flocks of sheep, who, if he go

79
00:02:44,825 --> 00:02:46,158
 through both treadeth down and teareth in pieces,

80
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:47,491
 and none can deliver

81
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:51,467
13 Their hand shall be lifted up upon their

82
00:02:51,467 --> 00:02:55,467
 adversaries, and all their enemies shall be cut off

83
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:59,442
14 Yea, wo be unto the Gentiles except they

84
00:02:59,442 --> 00:03:03,442
 repent; for it shall come to pass in that day, saith the

85
00:03:03,442 --> 00:03:07,442
 Father, that I will cut off thy horses out of the

86
00:03:07,442 --> 00:03:11,442
 midst of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots

87
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:15,391
15 And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and

88
00:03:15,391 --> 00:03:19,391
 throw down all thy strongholds

89
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:27,366
16 And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thy land,

90
00:03:27,366 --> 00:03:35,366
 and thou shalt have no more soothsayers

91
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:43,315
17 Thy graven images I will also cut off, and thy

92
00:03:43,315 --> 00:03:51,315
 standing images out of the midst of thee, and thou

93
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:59,315
 shalt no more worship the works of thy hands

94
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:15,239
18 And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst

95
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:31,239
 of thee; so will I destroy thy cities

96
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:33,805
19 And it shall come to pass that all lyings, and

97
00:04:33,805 --> 00:04:36,472
 deceivings, and envyings, and strifes, and

98
00:04:36,472 --> 00:04:39,139
 priestcrafts, and whoredoms, shall be done away

99
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,112
20 For it shall come to pass, saith the Father,

100
00:04:41,112 --> 00:04:43,112
 that at that day whosoever will not repent and come

101
00:04:43,112 --> 00:04:45,112
 unto my Beloved Son, them will I cut off from

102
00:04:45,112 --> 00:04:47,112
 among my people, O house of Israel

103
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,754
21 And I will execute vengeance and fury upon

104
00:04:49,754 --> 00:04:52,421
 them, even as upon the heathen, such as they have not

105
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:55,088
 heard

106
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,394
22 But if they will repent and hearken unto my

107
00:04:56,394 --> 00:04:57,727
 words, and harden not their hearts, I will establish

108
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,06
 my church among them, and they shall come in unto

109
00:04:59,06 --> 00:05:00,393
 the covenant and be numbered among this the

110
00:05:00,393 --> 00:05:01,726
 remnant of Jacob, unto whom I have given this land for

111
00:05:01,726 --> 00:05:03,059
 their inheritance

112
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,036
23 And they shall assist my people, the remnant of

113
00:05:05,036 --> 00:05:07,036
 Jacob, and also as many of the house of Israel as

114
00:05:07,036 --> 00:05:09,036
 shall come, that they may build a city, which

115
00:05:09,036 --> 00:05:11,036
 shall be called the New Jerusalem

116
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:26,678
24 And then shall they assist my people that they

117
00:05:26,678 --> 00:05:42,345
 may be gathered in, who are scattered upon all the

118
00:05:42,345 --> 00:05:58,012
 face of the land, in unto the New Jerusalem

119
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:14,858
25 And then shall the power of heaven come down

120
00:06:14,858 --> 00:06:30,858
 among them; and I also will be in the midst

121
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:31,9
26 And then shall the work of the Father commence

122
00:06:31,9 --> 00:06:33,043
 at that day, even when this gospel shall be

123
00:06:33,043 --> 00:06:34,186
 preached among the remnant of this people. Verily I say

124
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:35,329
 unto you, at that day shall the work of the Father

125
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:36,472
 commence among all the dispersed of my people,

126
00:06:36,472 --> 00:06:37,615
 yea, even the tribes which have been lost, which the

127
00:06:37,615 --> 00:06:38,758
 Father hath led away out of Jerusalem

128
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:48,732
27 Yea, the work shall commence among all the

129
00:06:48,732 --> 00:06:58,732
 dispersed of my people, with the Father to prepare the

130
00:06:58,732 --> 00:07:08,732
 way whereby they may come unto me, that they may

131
00:07:08,732 --> 00:07:18,732
 call on the Father in my name

132
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:28,605
28 Yea, and then shall the work commence, with the

133
00:07:28,605 --> 00:07:38,605
 Father among all nations in preparing the way

134
00:07:38,605 --> 00:07:48,605
 whereby his people may be gathered home to the land

135
00:07:48,605 --> 00:07:58,605
 of their inheritance

136
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:58,728
29 And they shall go out from all nations; and

137
00:07:58,728 --> 00:07:58,978
 they shall not go out in haste, nor go by flight, for

138
00:07:58,978 --> 00:07:59,228
 I will go before them, saith the Father, and I

139
00:07:59,228 --> 00:07:59,478
 will be their rearward.
