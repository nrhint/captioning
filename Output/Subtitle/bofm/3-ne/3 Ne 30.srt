1 Hearken, O ye Gentiles, and hear the words of

5
00:00:09,575 --> 00:00:11,175
 Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God, which he

6
00:00:11,175 --> 00:00:12,775
 hath commanded me that I should speak concerning

7
00:00:12,775 --> 00:00:14,375
 you, for, behold he commandeth me that I should

8
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:15,975
 write, saying

9
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:16,313
2 Turn, all ye Gentiles, from your wicked ways;

10
00:00:16,313 --> 00:00:16,677
 and repent of your evil doings, of your lyings and

11
00:00:16,677 --> 00:00:17,041
 deceivings, and of your whoredoms, and of your

12
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:17,405
 secret abominations, and your idolatries, and of your

13
00:00:17,405 --> 00:00:17,769
 murders, and your priestcrafts, and your envyings,

14
00:00:17,769 --> 00:00:18,133
 and your strifes, and from all your wickedness

15
00:00:18,133 --> 00:00:18,497
 and abominations, and come unto me, and be baptized

16
00:00:18,497 --> 00:00:18,861
 in my name, that ye may receive a remission of

17
00:00:18,861 --> 00:00:19,225
 your sins, and be filled with the Holy Ghost, that ye

18
00:00:19,225 --> 00:00:19,589
 may be numbered with my people who are of the

19
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:19,953
 house of Israel.
