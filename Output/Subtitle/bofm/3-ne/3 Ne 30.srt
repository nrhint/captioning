Chapter 30 The latter-day Gentiles are

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
commanded to repent, come unto Christ, and be

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:03:45,
numbered with the house of Israel. About A.D. 34–35. 

4
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
1 Hearken, O ye Gentiles, and hear the

5
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
words of Jesus Christ, the Son of the

6
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
living God, which he hath commanded me that I

7
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
should speak concerning you, for, behold

8
00:03:45,0 --> 00:10:53,
he commandeth me that I should write, saying:

9
00:10:53,0 --> 00:10:53,0
2 Turn, all ye Gentiles, from your

10
00:10:53,0 --> 00:10:53,0
wicked ways; and repent of your evil

11
00:10:53,0 --> 00:10:53,0
doings, of your lyings and deceivings, and of

12
00:10:53,0 --> 00:10:53,0
your whoredoms, and of your secret

13
00:10:53,0 --> 00:10:53,0
abominations, and your idolatries, and of

14
00:10:53,0 --> 00:10:53,0
your murders, and your priestcrafts,

15
00:10:53,0 --> 00:10:53,0
and your envyings, and your strifes, and

16
00:10:53,0 --> 00:10:53,0
from all your wickedness and

17
00:10:53,0 --> 00:10:53,0
abominations, and come unto me, and be baptized

18
00:10:53,0 --> 00:10:53,0
in my name, that ye may receive a

19
00:10:53,0 --> 00:10:53,0
remission of your sins, and be filled with

20
00:10:53,0 --> 00:10:53,0
the Holy Ghost, that ye may be numbered

21
00:10:53,0 --> 00:12:05,
with my people who are of the house of Israel.
