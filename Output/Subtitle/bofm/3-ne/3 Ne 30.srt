Chapter 30 The latter-day Gentiles are

2
00:00:05,0 --> 00:00:10,0
commanded to repent, come unto Christ, and be

3
00:00:10,0 --> 00:00:15,449
numbered with the house of Israel. About A.D. 34–35. 

4
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:17,449
1 Hearken, O ye Gentiles, and hear the

5
00:00:17,449 --> 00:00:19,449
words of Jesus Christ, the Son of the

6
00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:21,449
living God, which he hath commanded me that I

7
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:23,449
should speak concerning you, for, behold

8
00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:25,826
he commandeth me that I should write, saying:

9
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:25,749
2 Turn, all ye Gentiles, from your

10
00:00:25,749 --> 00:00:25,672
wicked ways; and repent of your evil

11
00:00:25,672 --> 00:00:25,595
doings, of your lyings and deceivings, and of

12
00:00:25,595 --> 00:00:25,518
your whoredoms, and of your secret

13
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:25,441
abominations, and your idolatries, and of

14
00:00:25,441 --> 00:00:25,364
your murders, and your priestcrafts,

15
00:00:25,364 --> 00:00:25,287
and your envyings, and your strifes, and

16
00:00:25,287 --> 00:00:25,21
from all your wickedness and

17
00:00:25,21 --> 00:00:25,133
abominations, and come unto me, and be baptized

18
00:00:25,133 --> 00:00:25,056
in my name, that ye may receive a

19
00:00:25,056 --> 00:00:24,979
remission of your sins, and be filled with

20
00:00:24,979 --> 00:00:24,902
the Holy Ghost, that ye may be numbered

21
00:00:24,902 --> 00:00:24,892
with my people who are of the house of Israel.
