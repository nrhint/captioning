00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:04,6
Chapter 5 The Nephites repent and forsake their

2
00:00:04,6 --> 00:00:09,2
 sins—Mormon writes the history of his people and

3
00:00:09,2 --> 00:00:13,8
 declares the everlasting word to them—Israel will be

4
00:00:13,8 --> 00:00:18,4
 gathered in from her long dispersion. About

5
00:00:18,4 --> 00:00:23,0
 A.D. 22–26.

6
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:33,724
1 And now behold, there was not a living soul

7
00:00:33,724 --> 00:00:43,524
 among all the people of the Nephites who did doubt in

8
00:00:43,524 --> 00:00:53,324
 the least the words of all the holy prophets who

9
00:00:53,324 --> 00:01:03,124
 had spoken; for they knew that it must needs be

10
00:01:03,124 --> 00:01:12,924
 that they must be fulfilled

11
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,668
2 And they knew that it must be expedient that

12
00:01:16,668 --> 00:01:21,097
 Christ had come, because of the many signs which had

13
00:01:21,097 --> 00:01:25,526
 been given, according to the words of the

14
00:01:25,526 --> 00:01:29,955
 prophets; and because of the things which had come to pass

15
00:01:29,955 --> 00:01:34,384
 already they knew that it must needs be that all

16
00:01:34,384 --> 00:01:38,813
 things should come to pass according to that which

17
00:01:38,813 --> 00:01:43,242
 had been spoken

18
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:50,704
3 Therefore they did forsake all their sins, and

19
00:01:50,704 --> 00:01:57,704
 their abominations, and their whoredoms, and did

20
00:01:57,704 --> 00:02:04,704
 serve God with all diligence day and night

21
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:10,958
4 And now it came to pass that when they had taken

22
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:16,958
 all the robbers prisoners, insomuch that none did

23
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:22,958
 escape who were not slain, they did cast their

24
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:28,958
 prisoners into prison, and did cause the word of God

25
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:34,958
 to be preached unto them; and as many as would

26
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:40,958
 repent of their sins and enter into a covenant that

27
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:46,958
 they would murder no more were set at liberty

28
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:50,733
5 But as many as there were who did not enter into

29
00:02:50,733 --> 00:02:55,233
 a covenant, and who did still continue to have

30
00:02:55,233 --> 00:02:59,733
 those secret murders in their hearts, yea, as many

31
00:02:59,733 --> 00:03:04,233
 as were found breathing out threatenings against

32
00:03:04,233 --> 00:03:08,733
 their brethren were condemned and punished according

33
00:03:08,733 --> 00:03:13,233
 to the law

34
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:21,894
6 And thus they did put an end to all those

35
00:03:21,894 --> 00:03:29,894
 wicked, and secret, and abominable combinations, in the

36
00:03:29,894 --> 00:03:37,894
 which there was so much wickedness, and so many

37
00:03:37,894 --> 00:03:45,894
 murders committed

38
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:48,625
7 And thus had the twenty and second year passed

39
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:51,625
 away, and the twenty and third year also, and the

40
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:54,625
 twenty and fourth, and the twenty and fifth; and

41
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,625
 thus had twenty and five years passed away

42
00:03:57,27 --> 00:04:03,27
8 And there had many things transpired which, in

43
00:04:03,27 --> 00:04:09,27
 the eyes of some, would be great and marvelous;

44
00:04:09,27 --> 00:04:15,27
 nevertheless, they cannot all be written in this

45
00:04:15,27 --> 00:04:21,27
 book; yea, this book cannot contain even a hundredth

46
00:04:21,27 --> 00:04:27,27
 part of what was done among so many people in the

47
00:04:27,27 --> 00:04:33,27
 space of twenty and five years

48
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:40,474
9 But behold there are records which do contain

49
00:04:40,474 --> 00:04:47,141
 all the proceedings of this people; and a shorter

50
00:04:47,141 --> 00:04:53,808
 but true account was given by Nephi

51
00:04:53,96 --> 00:04:58,96
10 Therefore I have made my record of these things

52
00:04:58,96 --> 00:05:03,96
 according to the record of Nephi, which was

53
00:05:03,96 --> 00:05:08,96
 engraven on the plates which were called the plates of

54
00:05:08,96 --> 00:05:13,96
 Nephi

55
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:18,946
11 And behold, I do make the record on plates

56
00:05:18,946 --> 00:05:24,446
 which I have made with mine own hands

57
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:29,491
12 And behold, I am called Mormon, being called

58
00:05:29,491 --> 00:05:34,491
 after the land of Mormon, the land in which Alma did

59
00:05:34,491 --> 00:05:39,491
 establish the church among the people, yea, the

60
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:44,491
 first church which was established among them after

61
00:05:44,491 --> 00:05:49,491
 their transgression

62
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:55,783
13 Behold, I am a disciple of Jesus Christ, the

63
00:05:55,783 --> 00:06:01,783
 Son of God. I have been called of him to declare his

64
00:06:01,783 --> 00:06:07,783
 word among his people, that they might have

65
00:06:07,783 --> 00:06:13,783
 everlasting life

66
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:18,806
14 And it hath become expedient that I, according

67
00:06:18,806 --> 00:06:24,606
 to the will of God, that the prayers of those who

68
00:06:24,606 --> 00:06:30,406
 have gone hence, who were the holy ones, should be

69
00:06:30,406 --> 00:06:36,206
 fulfilled according to their faith, should make a

70
00:06:36,206 --> 00:06:42,006
 record of these things which have been done

71
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:48,302
15 Yea, a small record of that which hath taken

72
00:06:48,302 --> 00:06:53,635
 place from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem, even

73
00:06:53,635 --> 00:06:58,968
 down until the present time

74
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:05,352
16 Therefore I do make my record from the accounts

75
00:07:05,352 --> 00:07:12,019
 which have been given by those who were before

76
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:18,686
 me, until the commencement of my day

77
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:23,705
17 And then I do make a record of the things which

78
00:07:23,705 --> 00:07:28,705
 I have seen with mine own eyes

79
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:34,248
18 And I know the record which I make to be a just

80
00:07:34,248 --> 00:07:39,748
 and a true record; nevertheless there are many

81
00:07:39,748 --> 00:07:45,248
 things which, according to our language, we are not

82
00:07:45,248 --> 00:07:50,748
 able to write

83
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:56,903
19 And now I make an end of my saying, which is of

84
00:07:56,903 --> 00:08:03,57
 myself, and proceed to give my account of the

85
00:08:03,57 --> 00:08:10,237
 things which have been before me

86
00:08:10,19 --> 00:08:18,19
20 I am Mormon, and a pure descendant of Lehi. I

87
00:08:18,19 --> 00:08:26,19
 have reason to bless my God and my Savior Jesus

88
00:08:26,19 --> 00:08:34,19
 Christ, that he brought our fathers out of the land

89
00:08:34,19 --> 00:08:42,19
 of Jerusalem, (and no one knew it save it were

90
00:08:42,19 --> 00:08:50,19
 himself and those whom he brought out of that land)

91
00:08:50,19 --> 00:08:58,19
 and that he hath given me and my people so much

92
00:08:58,19 --> 00:09:06,19
 knowledge unto the salvation of our souls

93
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:13,512
21 Surely he hath blessed the house of Jacob, and

94
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:21,012
 hath been merciful unto the seed of Joseph

95
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:26,627
22 And insomuch as the children of Lehi have kept

96
00:09:26,627 --> 00:09:31,96
 his commandments he hath blessed them and

97
00:09:31,96 --> 00:09:37,293
 prospered them according to his word

98
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:43,61
23 Yea, and surely shall he again bring a remnant

99
00:09:43,61 --> 00:09:49,943
 of the seed of Joseph to the knowledge of the Lord

100
00:09:49,943 --> 00:09:56,276
 their God

101
00:09:56,196 --> 00:10:01,696
24 And as surely as the Lord liveth, will he

102
00:10:01,696 --> 00:10:07,196
 gather in from the four quarters of the earth all the

103
00:10:07,196 --> 00:10:12,696
 remnant of the seed of Jacob, who are scattered

104
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:18,196
 abroad upon all the face of the earth

105
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:24,352
25 And as he hath covenanted with all the house of

106
00:10:24,352 --> 00:10:30,019
 Jacob, even so shall the covenant wherewith he

107
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:35,686
 hath covenanted with the house of Jacob be fulfilled

108
00:10:35,686 --> 00:10:41,353
 in his own due time, unto the restoring all the

109
00:10:41,353 --> 00:10:47,02
 house of Jacob unto the knowledge of the covenant

110
00:10:47,02 --> 00:10:52,687
 that he hath covenanted with them

111
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:55,052
26 And then shall they know their Redeemer, who is

112
00:10:55,052 --> 00:10:57,385
 Jesus Christ, the Son of God; and then shall they

113
00:10:57,385 --> 00:10:59,718
 be gathered in from the four quarters of the

114
00:10:59,718 --> 00:11:02,051
 earth unto their own lands, from whence they have been

115
00:11:02,051 --> 00:11:04,384
 dispersed; yea, as the Lord liveth so shall it

116
00:11:04,384 --> 00:11:06,717
 be. Amen.
