00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:07,4
Chapter 5 The Nephites repent and forsake

2
00:00:07,4 --> 00:00:14,8
their sins—Mormon writes the history of

3
00:00:14,8 --> 00:00:22,2
his people and declares the everlasting

4
00:00:22,2 --> 00:00:29,6
word to them—Israel will be gathered in

5
00:00:29,6 --> 00:00:37,771
from her long dispersion. About A.D. 22–26. 

6
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:37,604
1 And now behold, there was not a

7
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:37,437
living soul among all the people of the

8
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:37,27
Nephites who did doubt in the least

9
00:00:37,27 --> 00:00:37,103
the words of all the holy prophets who

10
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:36,936
had spoken; for they knew that it

11
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:36,837
must needs be that they must be fulfilled.

12
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:37,17
2 And they knew that it must be

13
00:00:37,17 --> 00:00:37,503
expedient that Christ had come,

14
00:00:37,503 --> 00:00:37,836
because of the many signs which had been

15
00:00:37,836 --> 00:00:38,169
given, according to the words of

16
00:00:38,169 --> 00:00:38,502
the prophets; and because of the

17
00:00:38,502 --> 00:00:38,835
things which had come to pass already

18
00:00:38,835 --> 00:00:39,168
they knew that it must needs be that

19
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:39,501
all things should come to pass

20
00:00:39,501 --> 00:00:39,239
according to that which had been spoken.

21
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:40,239
3 Therefore they did forsake

22
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,239
all their sins, and their

23
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:42,239
abominations, and their

24
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,239
whoredoms, and did serve God with

25
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:44,645
all diligence day and night.

26
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:45,337
4 And now it came to pass

27
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:46,029
that when they had taken

28
00:00:46,029 --> 00:00:46,721
all the robbers prisoners,

29
00:00:46,721 --> 00:00:47,413
insomuch that none did

30
00:00:47,413 --> 00:00:48,105
escape who were not slain,

31
00:00:48,105 --> 00:00:48,797
they did cast their

32
00:00:48,797 --> 00:00:49,489
prisoners into prison, and did

33
00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:50,181
cause the word of God to be

34
00:00:50,181 --> 00:00:50,873
preached unto them; and as

35
00:00:50,873 --> 00:00:51,565
many as would repent of

36
00:00:51,565 --> 00:00:52,257
their sins and enter into a

37
00:00:52,257 --> 00:00:52,949
covenant that they would

38
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:53,086
murder no more were set at liberty.

39
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:52,995
5 But as many as there

40
00:00:52,995 --> 00:00:52,904
were who did not enter

41
00:00:52,904 --> 00:00:52,813
into a covenant, and

42
00:00:52,813 --> 00:00:52,722
who did still continue to

43
00:00:52,722 --> 00:00:52,631
have those secret

44
00:00:52,631 --> 00:00:52,54
murders in their hearts,

45
00:00:52,54 --> 00:00:52,449
yea, as many as were

46
00:00:52,449 --> 00:00:52,358
found breathing out

47
00:00:52,358 --> 00:00:52,267
threatenings against their

48
00:00:52,267 --> 00:00:52,176
brethren were condemned

49
00:00:52,176 --> 00:00:52,152
and punished according to the law.

50
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:53,027
6 And thus they did

51
00:00:53,027 --> 00:00:53,902
put an end to all

52
00:00:53,902 --> 00:00:54,777
those wicked, and

53
00:00:54,777 --> 00:00:55,652
secret, and abominable

54
00:00:55,652 --> 00:00:56,527
combinations, in the

55
00:00:56,527 --> 00:00:57,402
which there was so

56
00:00:57,402 --> 00:00:58,277
much wickedness, and

57
00:00:58,277 --> 00:00:59,66
so many murders committed.

58
00:00:59,66 --> 00:00:59,96
7 And thus had the

59
00:00:59,96 --> 00:01:00,26
twenty and second

60
00:01:00,26 --> 00:01:00,56
year passed away,

61
00:01:00,56 --> 00:01:00,86
and the twenty and

62
00:01:00,86 --> 00:01:01,16
third year also, and

63
00:01:01,16 --> 00:01:01,46
the twenty and

64
00:01:01,46 --> 00:01:01,76
fourth, and the twenty

65
00:01:01,76 --> 00:01:02,06
and fifth; and thus

66
00:01:02,06 --> 00:01:02,36
had twenty and

67
00:01:02,36 --> 00:01:02,663
five years passed away.

68
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:02,996
8 And there had

69
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:03,329
many things

70
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:03,662
transpired which, in the

71
00:01:03,662 --> 00:01:03,995
eyes of some, would

72
00:01:03,995 --> 00:01:04,328
be great and

73
00:01:04,328 --> 00:01:04,661
marvelous;

74
00:01:04,661 --> 00:01:04,994
nevertheless, they cannot all

75
00:01:04,994 --> 00:01:05,327
be written in

76
00:01:05,327 --> 00:01:05,66
this book; yea, this

77
00:01:05,66 --> 00:01:05,993
book cannot

78
00:01:05,993 --> 00:01:06,326
contain even a hundredth

79
00:01:06,326 --> 00:01:06,659
part of what was

80
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:06,992
done among so many

81
00:01:06,992 --> 00:01:07,325
people in the

82
00:01:07,325 --> 00:01:07,067
space of twenty and five years;

83
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:07,067
9 But behold

84
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:07,067
there are records

85
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:07,067
which do contain

86
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:07,067
all the

87
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:07,067
proceedings of this

88
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:07,067
people; and a

89
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:07,067
shorter but true

90
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:07,534
account was given by Nephi.

91
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:08,734
10 Therefore I

92
00:01:08,734 --> 00:01:09,934
have made my

93
00:01:09,934 --> 00:01:11,134
record of these

94
00:01:11,134 --> 00:01:12,334
things according

95
00:01:12,334 --> 00:01:13,534
to the record

96
00:01:13,534 --> 00:01:14,734
of Nephi, which

97
00:01:14,734 --> 00:01:15,934
was engraven

98
00:01:15,934 --> 00:01:17,134
on the plates

99
00:01:17,134 --> 00:01:18,334
which were called

100
00:01:18,334 --> 00:01:19,913
the plates of Nephi.

101
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:20,413
11 And behold,

102
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:20,913
I do make the

103
00:01:20,913 --> 00:01:21,413
record on

104
00:01:21,413 --> 00:01:21,913
plates which I

105
00:01:21,913 --> 00:01:22,413
have made with

106
00:01:22,413 --> 00:01:22,316
mine own hands.

107
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:22,754
12 And

108
00:01:22,754 --> 00:01:23,192
behold, I am called

109
00:01:23,192 --> 00:01:23,63
Mormon,

110
00:01:23,63 --> 00:01:24,068
being called

111
00:01:24,068 --> 00:01:24,506
after the land of

112
00:01:24,506 --> 00:01:24,944
Mormon, the

113
00:01:24,944 --> 00:01:25,382
land in which

114
00:01:25,382 --> 00:01:25,82
Alma did

115
00:01:25,82 --> 00:01:26,258
establish the

116
00:01:26,258 --> 00:01:26,696
church among

117
00:01:26,696 --> 00:01:27,134
the people,

118
00:01:27,134 --> 00:01:27,572
yea, the first

119
00:01:27,572 --> 00:01:28,01
church which

120
00:01:28,01 --> 00:01:28,448
was

121
00:01:28,448 --> 00:01:28,886
established among them

122
00:01:28,886 --> 00:01:29,323
after their transgression.

123
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:29,631
13 Behold, I

124
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:29,939
am a

125
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:30,247
disciple of Jesus

126
00:01:30,247 --> 00:01:30,555
Christ, the

127
00:01:30,555 --> 00:01:30,863
Son of God.

128
00:01:30,863 --> 00:01:31,171
I have been

129
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:31,479
called of

130
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:31,787
him to declare

131
00:01:31,787 --> 00:01:32,095
his word

132
00:01:32,095 --> 00:01:32,403
among his

133
00:01:32,403 --> 00:01:32,711
people, that

134
00:01:32,711 --> 00:01:33,019
they might have

135
00:01:33,019 --> 00:01:33,727
everlasting life.

136
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:34,441
14 And it

137
00:01:34,441 --> 00:01:35,155
hath become

138
00:01:35,155 --> 00:01:35,869
expedient

139
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:36,583
that I,

140
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:37,297
according to

141
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:38,011
the will of

142
00:01:38,011 --> 00:01:38,725
God, that

143
00:01:38,725 --> 00:01:39,439
the prayers

144
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,153
of those who

145
00:01:40,153 --> 00:01:40,867
have gone

146
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:41,581
hence, who

147
00:01:41,581 --> 00:01:42,295
were the

148
00:01:42,295 --> 00:01:43,009
holy ones,

149
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:43,723
should be

150
00:01:43,723 --> 00:01:44,437
fulfilled

151
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:45,151
according to

152
00:01:45,151 --> 00:01:45,865
their faith,

153
00:01:45,865 --> 00:01:46,579
should make

154
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:47,293
a record

155
00:01:47,293 --> 00:01:48,007
of these

156
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:48,709
things which have been done—

157
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:48,959
15 Yea, a

158
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:49,209
small

159
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:49,459
record of that

160
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:49,709
which

161
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:49,959
hath taken

162
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:50,209
place from

163
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:50,459
the time

164
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:50,709
that Lehi

165
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:50,959
left

166
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:51,209
Jerusalem, even

167
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:51,459
down until

168
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:51,111
the present time.

169
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,111
16

170
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,111
Therefore I do

171
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,111
make my

172
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,111
record

173
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,111
from the

174
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,111
accounts

175
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,111
which have

176
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,111
been given

177
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,111
by those

178
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,111
who were

179
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,111
before

180
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,111
me, until

181
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,111
the

182
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,111
commencement of my day;

183
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,111
17 And

184
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,111
then I do

185
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,111
make a

186
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,111
record

187
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,111
of the

188
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,111
things

189
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,111
which I

190
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,111
have seen

191
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,111
with mine

192
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,111
own eyes.

193
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,111
18 And

194
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,111
I know

195
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,111
the

196
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,111
record

197
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,111
which I

198
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,111
make to

199
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,111
be a

200
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,111
just and a

201
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,111
true

202
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,111
record;

203
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,111


204
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,111
