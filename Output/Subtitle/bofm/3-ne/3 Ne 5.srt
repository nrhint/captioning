00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 5 The Nephites repent and forsake

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
their sins—Mormon writes the history of

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
his people and declares the everlasting

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
word to them—Israel will be gathered in

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:03:45,
from her long dispersion. About A.D. 22–26. 

6
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
1 And now behold, there was not a

7
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
living soul among all the people of the

8
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
Nephites who did doubt in the least

9
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
the words of all the holy prophets who

10
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
had spoken; for they knew that it

11
00:03:45,0 --> 00:18:52,
must needs be that they must be fulfilled.

12
00:18:52,0 --> 00:18:52,0
2 And they knew that it must be

13
00:18:52,0 --> 00:18:52,0
expedient that Christ had come,

14
00:18:52,0 --> 00:18:52,0
because of the many signs which had been

15
00:18:52,0 --> 00:18:52,0
given, according to the words of

16
00:18:52,0 --> 00:18:52,0
the prophets; and because of the

17
00:18:52,0 --> 00:18:52,0
things which had come to pass already

18
00:18:52,0 --> 00:18:52,0
they knew that it must needs be that

19
00:18:52,0 --> 00:18:52,0
all things should come to pass

20
00:18:52,0 --> 00:22:22,
according to that which had been spoken.

21
00:22:22,0 --> 00:22:22,0
3 Therefore they did forsake

22
00:22:22,0 --> 00:22:22,0
all their sins, and their

23
00:22:22,0 --> 00:22:22,0
abominations, and their

24
00:22:22,0 --> 00:22:22,0
whoredoms, and did serve God with

25
00:22:22,0 --> 00:23:20,
all diligence day and night.

26
00:23:20,0 --> 00:23:20,0
4 And now it came to pass

27
00:23:20,0 --> 00:23:20,0
that when they had taken

28
00:23:20,0 --> 00:23:20,0
all the robbers prisoners,

29
00:23:20,0 --> 00:23:20,0
insomuch that none did

30
00:23:20,0 --> 00:23:20,0
escape who were not slain,

31
00:23:20,0 --> 00:23:20,0
they did cast their

32
00:23:20,0 --> 00:23:20,0
prisoners into prison, and did

33
00:23:20,0 --> 00:23:20,0
cause the word of God to be

34
00:23:20,0 --> 00:23:20,0
preached unto them; and as

35
00:23:20,0 --> 00:23:20,0
many as would repent of

36
00:23:20,0 --> 00:23:20,0
their sins and enter into a

37
00:23:20,0 --> 00:23:20,0
covenant that they would

38
00:23:20,0 --> 00:25:32,
murder no more were set at liberty.

39
00:25:32,0 --> 00:25:32,0
5 But as many as there

40
00:25:32,0 --> 00:25:32,0
were who did not enter

41
00:25:32,0 --> 00:25:32,0
into a covenant, and

42
00:25:32,0 --> 00:25:32,0
who did still continue to

43
00:25:32,0 --> 00:25:32,0
have those secret

44
00:25:32,0 --> 00:25:32,0
murders in their hearts,

45
00:25:32,0 --> 00:25:32,0
yea, as many as were

46
00:25:32,0 --> 00:25:32,0
found breathing out

47
00:25:32,0 --> 00:25:32,0
threatenings against their

48
00:25:32,0 --> 00:25:32,0
brethren were condemned

49
00:25:32,0 --> 00:27:44,
and punished according to the law.

50
00:27:44,0 --> 00:27:44,0
6 And thus they did

51
00:27:44,0 --> 00:27:44,0
put an end to all

52
00:27:44,0 --> 00:27:44,0
those wicked, and

53
00:27:44,0 --> 00:27:44,0
secret, and abominable

54
00:27:44,0 --> 00:27:44,0
combinations, in the

55
00:27:44,0 --> 00:27:44,0
which there was so

56
00:27:44,0 --> 00:27:44,0
much wickedness, and

57
00:27:44,0 --> 00:27:16,
so many murders committed.

58
00:27:16,0 --> 00:27:16,0
7 And thus had the

59
00:27:16,0 --> 00:27:16,0
twenty and second

60
00:27:16,0 --> 00:27:16,0
year passed away,

61
00:27:16,0 --> 00:27:16,0
and the twenty and

62
00:27:16,0 --> 00:27:16,0
third year also, and

63
00:27:16,0 --> 00:27:16,0
the twenty and

64
00:27:16,0 --> 00:27:16,0
fourth, and the twenty

65
00:27:16,0 --> 00:27:16,0
and fifth; and thus

66
00:27:16,0 --> 00:27:16,0
had twenty and

67
00:27:16,0 --> 00:29:28,
five years passed away.

68
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
8 And there had

69
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
many things

70
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
transpired which, in the

71
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
eyes of some, would

72
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
be great and

73
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
marvelous;

74
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
nevertheless, they cannot all

75
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
be written in

76
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
this book; yea, this

77
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
book cannot

78
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
contain even a hundredth

79
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
part of what was

80
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
done among so many

81
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
people in the

82
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:00,
space of twenty and five years;

83
00:29:00,0 --> 00:29:00,0
9 But behold

84
00:29:00,0 --> 00:29:00,0
there are records

85
00:29:00,0 --> 00:29:00,0
which do contain

86
00:29:00,0 --> 00:29:00,0
all the

87
00:29:00,0 --> 00:29:00,0
proceedings of this

88
00:29:00,0 --> 00:29:00,0
people; and a

89
00:29:00,0 --> 00:29:00,0
shorter but true

90
00:29:00,0 --> 00:28:32,
account was given by Nephi.

91
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
10 Therefore I

92
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
have made my

93
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
record of these

94
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
things according

95
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
to the record

96
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
of Nephi, which

97
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
was engraven

98
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
on the plates

99
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
which were called

100
00:28:32,0 --> 00:33:29,
the plates of Nephi.

101
00:33:29,0 --> 00:33:29,0
11 And behold,

102
00:33:29,0 --> 00:33:29,0
I do make the

103
00:33:29,0 --> 00:33:29,0
record on

104
00:33:29,0 --> 00:33:29,0
plates which I

105
00:33:29,0 --> 00:33:29,0
have made with

106
00:33:29,0 --> 00:33:01,
mine own hands.

107
00:33:01,0 --> 00:33:01,0
12 And

108
00:33:01,0 --> 00:33:01,0
behold, I am called

109
00:33:01,0 --> 00:33:01,0
Mormon,

110
00:33:01,0 --> 00:33:01,0
being called

111
00:33:01,0 --> 00:33:01,0
after the land of

112
00:33:01,0 --> 00:33:01,0
Mormon, the

113
00:33:01,0 --> 00:33:01,0
land in which

114
00:33:01,0 --> 00:33:01,0
Alma did

115
00:33:01,0 --> 00:33:01,0
establish the

116
00:33:01,0 --> 00:33:01,0
church among

117
00:33:01,0 --> 00:33:01,0
the people,

118
00:33:01,0 --> 00:33:01,0
yea, the first

119
00:33:01,0 --> 00:33:01,0
church which

120
00:33:01,0 --> 00:33:01,0
was

121
00:33:01,0 --> 00:33:01,0
established among them

122
00:33:01,0 --> 00:32:33,
after their transgression.

123
00:32:33,0 --> 00:32:33,0
13 Behold, I

124
00:32:33,0 --> 00:32:33,0
am a

125
00:32:33,0 --> 00:32:33,0
disciple of Jesus

126
00:32:33,0 --> 00:32:33,0
Christ, the

127
00:32:33,0 --> 00:32:33,0
Son of God.

128
00:32:33,0 --> 00:32:33,0
I have been

129
00:32:33,0 --> 00:32:33,0
called of

130
00:32:33,0 --> 00:32:33,0
him to declare

131
00:32:33,0 --> 00:32:33,0
his word

132
00:32:33,0 --> 00:32:33,0
among his

133
00:32:33,0 --> 00:32:33,0
people, that

134
00:32:33,0 --> 00:32:33,0
they might have

135
00:32:33,0 --> 00:34:45,
everlasting life.

136
00:34:45,0 --> 00:34:45,0
14 And it

137
00:34:45,0 --> 00:34:45,0
hath become

138
00:34:45,0 --> 00:34:45,0
expedient

139
00:34:45,0 --> 00:34:45,0
that I,

140
00:34:45,0 --> 00:34:45,0
according to

141
00:34:45,0 --> 00:34:45,0
the will of

142
00:34:45,0 --> 00:34:45,0
God, that

143
00:34:45,0 --> 00:34:45,0
the prayers

144
00:34:45,0 --> 00:34:45,0
of those who

145
00:34:45,0 --> 00:34:45,0
have gone

146
00:34:45,0 --> 00:34:45,0
hence, who

147
00:34:45,0 --> 00:34:45,0
were the

148
00:34:45,0 --> 00:34:45,0
holy ones,

149
00:34:45,0 --> 00:34:45,0
should be

150
00:34:45,0 --> 00:34:45,0
fulfilled

151
00:34:45,0 --> 00:34:45,0
according to

152
00:34:45,0 --> 00:34:45,0
their faith,

153
00:34:45,0 --> 00:34:45,0
should make

154
00:34:45,0 --> 00:34:45,0
a record

155
00:34:45,0 --> 00:34:45,0
of these

156
00:34:45,0 --> 00:42:15,
things which have been done—

157
00:42:15,0 --> 00:42:15,0
15 Yea, a

158
00:42:15,0 --> 00:42:15,0
small

159
00:42:15,0 --> 00:42:15,0
record of that

160
00:42:15,0 --> 00:42:15,0
which

161
00:42:15,0 --> 00:42:15,0
hath taken

162
00:42:15,0 --> 00:42:15,0
place from

163
00:42:15,0 --> 00:42:15,0
the time

164
00:42:15,0 --> 00:42:15,0
that Lehi

165
00:42:15,0 --> 00:42:15,0
left

166
00:42:15,0 --> 00:42:15,0
Jerusalem, even

167
00:42:15,0 --> 00:42:15,0
down until

168
00:42:15,0 --> 00:41:47,
the present time.

169
00:41:47,0 --> 00:41:47,0
16

170
00:41:47,0 --> 00:41:47,0
Therefore I do

171
00:41:47,0 --> 00:41:47,0
make my

172
00:41:47,0 --> 00:41:47,0
record

173
00:41:47,0 --> 00:41:47,0
from the

174
00:41:47,0 --> 00:41:47,0
accounts

175
00:41:47,0 --> 00:41:47,0
which have

176
00:41:47,0 --> 00:41:47,0
been given

177
00:41:47,0 --> 00:41:47,0
by those

178
00:41:47,0 --> 00:41:47,0
who were

179
00:41:47,0 --> 00:41:47,0
before

180
00:41:47,0 --> 00:41:47,0
me, until

181
00:41:47,0 --> 00:41:47,0
the

182
00:41:47,0 --> 00:41:19,
commencement of my day;

183
00:41:19,0 --> 00:41:19,0
17 And

184
00:41:19,0 --> 00:41:19,0
then I do

185
00:41:19,0 --> 00:41:19,0
make a

186
00:41:19,0 --> 00:41:19,0
record

187
00:41:19,0 --> 00:41:19,0
of the

188
00:41:19,0 --> 00:41:19,0
things

189
00:41:19,0 --> 00:41:19,0
which I

190
00:41:19,0 --> 00:41:19,0
have seen

191
00:41:19,0 --> 00:41:19,0
with mine

192
00:41:19,0 --> 00:46:48,
own eyes.

193
00:46:48,0 --> 00:46:48,0
18 And

194
00:46:48,0 --> 00:46:48,0
I know

195
00:46:48,0 --> 00:46:48,0
the

196
00:46:48,0 --> 00:46:48,0
record

197
00:46:48,0 --> 00:46:48,0
which I

198
00:46:48,0 --> 00:46:48,0
make to

199
00:46:48,0 --> 00:46:48,0
be a

200
00:46:48,0 --> 00:46:48,0
just and a

201
00:46:48,0 --> 00:46:48,0
true

202
00:46:48,0 --> 00:46:48,0
record;

203
00:46:48,0 --> 00:46:48,0


204
00:46:48,0 --> 00:46:48,0
nevertheless

205
00:46:48,0 --> 00:46:48,0
there

206
00:46:48,0 --> 00:46:48,0
are many

207
00:46:48,0 --> 00:46:48,0
things

208
00:46:48,0 --> 00:46:48,0
which,

209
00:46:48,0 --> 00:46:48,0


210
00:46:48,0 --> 00:46:48,0
according to

211
00:46:48,0 --> 00:46:48,0
our

212
00:46:48,0 --> 00:46:48,0
language,

213
00:46:48,0 --> 00:52:16,
we are not able to write.

214
00:52:16,0 --> 00:52:16,0
19 And

215
00:52:16,0 --> 00:52:16,0
now I

216
00:52:16,0 --> 00:52:16,0
make

217
00:52:16,0 --> 00:52:16,0
an end

218
00:52:16,0 --> 00:52:16,0
of my

219
00:52:16,0 --> 00:52:16,0


220
00:52:16,0 --> 00:52:16,0
saying,

221
00:52:16,0 --> 00:52:16,0
which is

222
00:52:16,0 --> 00:52:16,0
of

223
00:52:16,0 --> 00:52:16,0
myself,

224
00:52:16,0 --> 00:52:16,0
and

225
00:52:16,0 --> 00:52:16,0
proceed

226
00:52:16,0 --> 00:52:16,0
