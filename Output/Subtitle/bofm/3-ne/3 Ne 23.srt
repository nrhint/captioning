1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:03,75
Chapter 23 Jesus approves the words of Isaiah—He

2
00:00:03,75 --> 00:00:07,5
 commands the people to search the prophets—The

3
00:00:07,5 --> 00:00:11,25
 words of Samuel the Lamanite concerning the

4
00:00:11,25 --> 00:00:15,0
 Resurrection are added to their records. About A.D. 34.

5
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,949
1 And now, behold, I say unto you, that ye ought

6
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:19,949
 to search these things. Yea, a commandment I give

7
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:21,949
 unto you that ye search these things diligently;

8
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:23,949
 for great are the words of Isaiah

9
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,924
2 For surely he spake as touching all things

10
00:00:25,924 --> 00:00:27,924
 concerning my people which are of the house of Israel;

11
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:29,924
 therefore it must needs be that he must speak also

12
00:00:29,924 --> 00:00:31,924
 to the Gentiles

13
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:39,399
3 And all things that he spake have been and shall

14
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:46,899
 be, even according to the words which he spake

15
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:54,446
4 Therefore give heed to my words; write the

16
00:00:54,446 --> 00:01:02,446
 things which I have told you; and according to the time

17
00:01:02,446 --> 00:01:10,446
 and the will of the Father they shall go forth

18
00:01:10,446 --> 00:01:18,446
 unto the Gentiles

19
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:20,345
5 And whosoever will hearken unto my words and

20
00:01:20,345 --> 00:01:22,345
 repenteth and is baptized, the same shall be saved.

21
00:01:22,345 --> 00:01:24,345
 Search the prophets, for many there be that testify

22
00:01:24,345 --> 00:01:26,345
 of these things

23
00:01:26,32 --> 00:01:27,653
6 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had said

24
00:01:27,653 --> 00:01:28,986
 these words he said unto them again, after he had

25
00:01:28,986 --> 00:01:30,319
 expounded all the scriptures unto them which they

26
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:31,652
 had received, he said unto them: Behold, other

27
00:01:31,652 --> 00:01:32,985
 scriptures I would that ye should write, that ye

28
00:01:32,985 --> 00:01:34,318
 have not

29
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:38,294
7 And it came to pass that he said unto Nephi:

30
00:01:38,294 --> 00:01:42,294
 Bring forth the record which ye have kept

31
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,936
8 And when Nephi had brought forth the records,

32
00:01:44,936 --> 00:01:47,603
 and laid them before him, he cast his eyes upon them

33
00:01:47,603 --> 00:01:50,27
 and said

34
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:51,386
9 Verily I say unto you, I commanded my servant

35
00:01:51,386 --> 00:01:52,529
 Samuel, the Lamanite, that he should testify unto

36
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:53,672
 this people, that at the day that the Father should

37
00:01:53,672 --> 00:01:54,815
 glorify his name in me that there were many saints

38
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:55,958
 who should arise from the dead, and should appear

39
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:57,101
 unto many, and should minister unto them. And he

40
00:01:57,101 --> 00:01:58,244
 said unto them: Was it not so

41
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,885
10 And his disciples answered him and said: Yea,

42
00:02:00,885 --> 00:02:03,552
 Lord, Samuel did prophesy according to thy words,

43
00:02:03,552 --> 00:02:06,219
 and they were all fulfilled

44
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:08,193
11 And Jesus said unto them: How be it that ye

45
00:02:08,193 --> 00:02:10,193
 have not written this thing, that many saints did

46
00:02:10,193 --> 00:02:12,193
 arise and appear unto many and did minister unto

47
00:02:12,193 --> 00:02:14,193
 them

48
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:18,167
12 And it came to pass that Nephi remembered that

49
00:02:18,167 --> 00:02:22,167
 this thing had not been written

50
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,809
13 And it came to pass that Jesus commanded that

51
00:02:24,809 --> 00:02:27,476
 it should be written; therefore it was written

52
00:02:27,476 --> 00:02:30,143
 according as he commanded

53
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:30,117
14 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had

54
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:30,117
 expounded all the scriptures in one, which they had

55
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:30,117
 written, he commanded them that they should teach

56
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:30,117
 the things which he had expounded unto them.
