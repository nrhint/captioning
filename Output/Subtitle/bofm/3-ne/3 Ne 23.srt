1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 23 Jesus approves the words of Isaiah—He

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
commands the people to search the prophets—The

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
words of Samuel the Lamanite concerning the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:15:42,
Resurrection are added to their records. About A.D. 34. 

5
00:15:42,0 --> 00:15:42,0
1 And now, behold, I say unto you, that ye

6
00:15:42,0 --> 00:15:42,0
ought to search these things. Yea, a

7
00:15:42,0 --> 00:15:42,0
commandment I give unto you that ye search these things

8
00:15:42,0 --> 00:17:54,
diligently; for great are the words of Isaiah.

9
00:17:54,0 --> 00:17:54,0
2 For surely he spake as touching all

10
00:17:54,0 --> 00:17:54,0
things concerning my people which are of the

11
00:17:54,0 --> 00:17:54,0
house of Israel; therefore it must needs

12
00:17:54,0 --> 00:19:06,
be that he must speak also to the Gentiles.

13
00:19:06,0 --> 00:19:06,0
3 And all things that he spake

14
00:19:06,0 --> 00:19:06,0
have been and shall be, even

15
00:19:06,0 --> 00:29:16,
according to the words which he spake.

16
00:29:16,0 --> 00:29:16,0
4 Therefore give heed to my

17
00:29:16,0 --> 00:29:16,0
words; write the things

18
00:29:16,0 --> 00:29:16,0
which I have told you; and

19
00:29:16,0 --> 00:29:16,0
according to the time and the

20
00:29:16,0 --> 00:29:16,0
will of the Father they

21
00:29:16,0 --> 00:31:28,
shall go forth unto the Gentiles.

22
00:31:28,0 --> 00:31:28,0
5 And whosoever will

23
00:31:28,0 --> 00:31:28,0
hearken unto my words and

24
00:31:28,0 --> 00:31:28,0
repenteth and is

25
00:31:28,0 --> 00:31:28,0
baptized, the same shall be

26
00:31:28,0 --> 00:31:28,0
saved. Search the

27
00:31:28,0 --> 00:31:28,0
prophets, for many there be

28
00:31:28,0 --> 00:33:40,
that testify of these things.

29
00:33:40,0 --> 00:33:40,0
6 And now it came to

30
00:33:40,0 --> 00:33:40,0
pass that when Jesus

31
00:33:40,0 --> 00:33:40,0
had said these words

32
00:33:40,0 --> 00:33:40,0
he said unto them

33
00:33:40,0 --> 00:33:40,0
again, after he had

34
00:33:40,0 --> 00:33:40,0
expounded all the

35
00:33:40,0 --> 00:33:40,0
scriptures unto them which

36
00:33:40,0 --> 00:33:40,0
they had received, he

37
00:33:40,0 --> 00:33:40,0
said unto them:

38
00:33:40,0 --> 00:33:40,0
Behold, other scriptures I

39
00:33:40,0 --> 00:33:40,0
would that ye should

40
00:33:40,0 --> 00:39:22,
write, that ye have not.

41
00:39:22,0 --> 00:39:22,0
7 And it came to

42
00:39:22,0 --> 00:39:22,0
pass that he said

43
00:39:22,0 --> 00:39:22,0
unto Nephi:

44
00:39:22,0 --> 00:39:22,0
Bring forth the

45
00:39:22,0 --> 00:45:18,
record which ye have kept.

46
00:45:18,0 --> 00:45:18,0
8 And when

47
00:45:18,0 --> 00:45:18,0
Nephi had brought

48
00:45:18,0 --> 00:45:18,0
forth the

49
00:45:18,0 --> 00:45:18,0
records, and laid

50
00:45:18,0 --> 00:45:18,0
them before him,

51
00:45:18,0 --> 00:45:18,0
he cast his eyes

52
00:45:18,0 --> 00:44:50,
upon them and said:

53
00:44:50,0 --> 00:44:50,0
9 Verily I say

54
00:44:50,0 --> 00:44:50,0
unto you, I

55
00:44:50,0 --> 00:44:50,0
commanded my

56
00:44:50,0 --> 00:44:50,0
servant Samuel, the

57
00:44:50,0 --> 00:44:50,0
Lamanite, that

58
00:44:50,0 --> 00:44:50,0
he should

59
00:44:50,0 --> 00:44:50,0
testify unto this

60
00:44:50,0 --> 00:44:50,0
people, that at

61
00:44:50,0 --> 00:44:50,0
the day that the

62
00:44:50,0 --> 00:44:50,0
Father should

63
00:44:50,0 --> 00:44:50,0
glorify his

64
00:44:50,0 --> 00:44:50,0
name in me that

65
00:44:50,0 --> 00:44:50,0
there were many

66
00:44:50,0 --> 00:44:50,0
saints who

67
00:44:50,0 --> 00:44:50,0
should arise from

68
00:44:50,0 --> 00:44:50,0
the dead, and

69
00:44:50,0 --> 00:44:50,0
should appear unto

70
00:44:50,0 --> 00:44:50,0
many, and

71
00:44:50,0 --> 00:44:50,0
should minister

72
00:44:50,0 --> 00:44:50,0
unto them. And he

73
00:44:50,0 --> 00:44:50,0
said unto them:

74
00:44:50,0 --> 00:44:22,
Was it not so?

75
00:44:22,0 --> 00:44:22,0
10 And his

76
00:44:22,0 --> 00:44:22,0
disciples

77
00:44:22,0 --> 00:44:22,0
answered him and

78
00:44:22,0 --> 00:44:22,0
said: Yea, Lord,

79
00:44:22,0 --> 00:44:22,0
Samuel did

80
00:44:22,0 --> 00:44:22,0
prophesy according

81
00:44:22,0 --> 00:44:22,0
to thy words,

82
00:44:22,0 --> 00:44:22,0
and they were

83
00:44:22,0 --> 00:45:20,
all fulfilled.

84
00:45:20,0 --> 00:45:20,0
11 And Jesus

85
00:45:20,0 --> 00:45:20,0
said unto

86
00:45:20,0 --> 00:45:20,0
them: How be it

87
00:45:20,0 --> 00:45:20,0
that ye have

88
00:45:20,0 --> 00:45:20,0
not written

89
00:45:20,0 --> 00:45:20,0
this thing,

90
00:45:20,0 --> 00:45:20,0
that many

91
00:45:20,0 --> 00:45:20,0
saints did arise

92
00:45:20,0 --> 00:45:20,0
and appear

93
00:45:20,0 --> 00:45:20,0
unto many and

94
00:45:20,0 --> 00:47:32,
did minister unto them?

95
00:47:32,0 --> 00:47:32,0
12 And it

96
00:47:32,0 --> 00:47:32,0
came to pass

97
00:47:32,0 --> 00:47:32,0
that Nephi

98
00:47:32,0 --> 00:47:32,0
remembered

99
00:47:32,0 --> 00:47:32,0
that this

100
00:47:32,0 --> 00:47:32,0
thing had

101
00:47:32,0 --> 00:52:43,
not been written.

102
00:52:43,0 --> 00:52:43,0
13 And it

103
00:52:43,0 --> 00:52:43,0
came to

104
00:52:43,0 --> 00:52:43,0
pass that

105
00:52:43,0 --> 00:52:43,0
Jesus

106
00:52:43,0 --> 00:52:43,0
commanded that

107
00:52:43,0 --> 00:52:43,0
it should

108
00:52:43,0 --> 00:52:43,0
be written;

109
00:52:43,0 --> 00:52:43,0
therefore

110
00:52:43,0 --> 00:52:43,0
it was

111
00:52:43,0 --> 00:52:43,0
written

112
00:52:43,0 --> 00:52:43,0
according as

113
00:52:43,0 --> 00:56:56,
he commanded.

114
00:56:56,0 --> 00:56:56,0
14 And

115
00:56:56,0 --> 00:56:56,0
now it came

116
00:56:56,0 --> 00:56:56,0
to pass

117
00:56:56,0 --> 00:56:56,0
that when

118
00:56:56,0 --> 00:56:56,0
Jesus

119
00:56:56,0 --> 00:56:56,0
had

120
00:56:56,0 --> 00:56:56,0
expounded all

121
00:56:56,0 --> 00:56:56,0
the

122
00:56:56,0 --> 00:56:56,0
scriptures in

123
00:56:56,0 --> 00:56:56,0
one, which

124
00:56:56,0 --> 00:56:56,0
they had

125
00:56:56,0 --> 00:56:56,0
written,

126
00:56:56,0 --> 00:56:56,0
he

127
00:56:56,0 --> 00:56:56,0
commanded them

128
00:56:56,0 --> 00:56:56,0
that they

129
00:56:56,0 --> 00:56:56,0
should

130
00:56:56,0 --> 00:56:56,0
teach the

131
00:56:56,0 --> 00:56:56,0
things

132
00:56:56,0 --> 00:56:56,0
which he

133
00:56:56,0 --> 01:01:38,
had expounded unto them.
