1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:06,0
Chapter 23 Jesus approves the words of Isaiah—He

2
00:00:06,0 --> 00:00:12,0
commands the people to search the prophets—The

3
00:00:12,0 --> 00:00:18,0
words of Samuel the Lamanite concerning the

4
00:00:18,0 --> 00:00:24,358
Resurrection are added to their records. About A.D. 34. 

5
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:26,358
1 And now, behold, I say unto you, that ye

6
00:00:26,358 --> 00:00:28,358
ought to search these things. Yea, a

7
00:00:28,358 --> 00:00:30,358
commandment I give unto you that ye search these things

8
00:00:30,358 --> 00:00:32,799
diligently; for great are the words of Isaiah.

9
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:33,549
2 For surely he spake as touching all

10
00:00:33,549 --> 00:00:34,299
things concerning my people which are of the

11
00:00:34,299 --> 00:00:35,049
house of Israel; therefore it must needs

12
00:00:35,049 --> 00:00:35,202
be that he must speak also to the Gentiles.

13
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:43,202
3 And all things that he spake

14
00:00:43,202 --> 00:00:51,202
have been and shall be, even

15
00:00:51,202 --> 00:00:59,126
according to the words which he spake.

16
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:00,293
4 Therefore give heed to my

17
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:01,46
words; write the things

18
00:01:01,46 --> 00:01:02,627
which I have told you; and

19
00:01:02,627 --> 00:01:03,794
according to the time and the

20
00:01:03,794 --> 00:01:04,961
will of the Father they

21
00:01:04,961 --> 00:01:06,633
shall go forth unto the Gentiles.

22
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:08,633
5 And whosoever will

23
00:01:08,633 --> 00:01:10,633
hearken unto my words and

24
00:01:10,633 --> 00:01:12,633
repenteth and is

25
00:01:12,633 --> 00:01:14,633
baptized, the same shall be

26
00:01:14,633 --> 00:01:16,633
saved. Search the

27
00:01:16,633 --> 00:01:18,633
prophets, for many there be

28
00:01:18,633 --> 00:01:20,013
that testify of these things.

29
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:20,596
6 And now it came to

30
00:01:20,596 --> 00:01:21,179
pass that when Jesus

31
00:01:21,179 --> 00:01:21,762
had said these words

32
00:01:21,762 --> 00:01:22,345
he said unto them

33
00:01:22,345 --> 00:01:22,928
again, after he had

34
00:01:22,928 --> 00:01:23,511
expounded all the

35
00:01:23,511 --> 00:01:24,094
scriptures unto them which

36
00:01:24,094 --> 00:01:24,677
they had received, he

37
00:01:24,677 --> 00:01:25,26
said unto them:

38
00:01:25,26 --> 00:01:25,843
Behold, other scriptures I

39
00:01:25,843 --> 00:01:26,426
would that ye should

40
00:01:26,426 --> 00:01:27,521
write, that ye have not.

41
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
7 And it came to

42
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
pass that he said

43
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
unto Nephi:

44
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
Bring forth the

45
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,988
record which ye have kept.

46
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,988
8 And when

47
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,988
Nephi had brought

48
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,988
forth the

49
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,988
records, and laid

50
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,988
them before him,

51
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,988
he cast his eyes

52
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,521
upon them and said:

53
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
9 Verily I say

54
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
unto you, I

55
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
commanded my

56
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
servant Samuel, the

57
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
Lamanite, that

58
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
he should

59
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
testify unto this

60
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
people, that at

61
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
the day that the

62
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
Father should

63
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
glorify his

64
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
name in me that

65
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
there were many

66
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
saints who

67
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
should arise from

68
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
the dead, and

69
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
should appear unto

70
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
many, and

71
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
should minister

72
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
unto them. And he

73
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
said unto them:

74
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,988
Was it not so?

75
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,988
10 And his

76
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,988
disciples

77
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,988
answered him and

78
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,988
said: Yea, Lord,

79
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,988
Samuel did

80
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,988
prophesy according

81
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,988
to thy words,

82
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,988
and they were

83
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,521
all fulfilled.

84
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
11 And Jesus

85
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
said unto

86
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
them: How be it

87
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
that ye have

88
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
not written

89
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
this thing,

90
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
that many

91
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
saints did arise

92
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
and appear

93
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
unto many and

94
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,988
did minister unto them?

95
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,988
12 And it

96
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,988
came to pass

97
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,988
that Nephi

98
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,988
remembered

99
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,988
that this

100
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,988
thing had

101
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,521
not been written.

102
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
13 And it

103
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
came to

104
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
pass that

105
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
Jesus

106
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
commanded that

107
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
it should

108
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
be written;

109
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
therefore

110
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
it was

111
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
written

112
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,521
according as

113
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,988
he commanded.

114
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,988
14 And

115
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,988
now it came

116
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,988
to pass

117
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,988
that when

118
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,988
Jesus

119
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,988
had

120
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,988
expounded all

121
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,988
the

122
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,988
scriptures in

123
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,988
one, which

124
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,988
they had

125
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,988
written,

126
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,988
he

127
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,988
commanded them

128
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,988
that they

129
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,988
should

130
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,988
teach the

131
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,988
things

132
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,988
which he

133
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:27,521
had expounded unto them.
