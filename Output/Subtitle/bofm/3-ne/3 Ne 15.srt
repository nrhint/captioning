00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:04,6
Chapter 15 Jesus announces that the law of Moses

2
00:00:04,6 --> 00:00:09,2
 is fulfilled in Him—The Nephites are the other

3
00:00:09,2 --> 00:00:13,8
 sheep of whom He spoke in Jerusalem—Because of

4
00:00:13,8 --> 00:00:18,4
 iniquity, the Lord’s people in Jerusalem do not know of

5
00:00:18,4 --> 00:00:23,0
 the scattered sheep of Israel. About A.D. 34.

6
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,067
1 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had

7
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:26,21
 ended these sayings he cast his eyes round about on

8
00:00:26,21 --> 00:00:27,353
 the multitude, and said unto them: Behold, ye have

9
00:00:27,353 --> 00:00:28,496
 heard the things which I taught before I ascended

10
00:00:28,496 --> 00:00:29,639
 to my Father; therefore, whoso remembereth these

11
00:00:29,639 --> 00:00:30,782
 sayings of mine and doeth them, him will I raise up

12
00:00:30,782 --> 00:00:31,925
 at the last day

13
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,232
2 And it came to pass that when Jesus had said

14
00:00:33,232 --> 00:00:34,565
 these words he perceived that there were some among

15
00:00:34,565 --> 00:00:35,898
 them who marveled, and wondered what he would

16
00:00:35,898 --> 00:00:37,231
 concerning the law of Moses; for they understood not

17
00:00:37,231 --> 00:00:38,564
 the saying that old things had passed away, and that

18
00:00:38,564 --> 00:00:39,897
 all things had become new

19
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,54
3 And he said unto them: Marvel not that I said

20
00:00:42,54 --> 00:00:45,207
 unto you that old things had passed away, and that

21
00:00:45,207 --> 00:00:47,874
 all things had become new

22
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:51,147
4 Behold, I say unto you that the law is fulfilled

23
00:00:51,147 --> 00:00:55,147
 that was given unto Moses

24
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:57,122
5 Behold, I am he that gave the law, and I am he

25
00:00:57,122 --> 00:00:59,122
 who covenanted with my people Israel; therefore,

26
00:00:59,122 --> 00:01:01,122
 the law in me is fulfilled, for I have come to

27
00:01:01,122 --> 00:01:03,122
 fulfil the law; therefore it hath an end

28
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:05,763
6 Behold, I do not destroy the prophets, for as

29
00:01:05,763 --> 00:01:08,43
 many as have not been fulfilled in me, verily I say

30
00:01:08,43 --> 00:01:11,097
 unto you, shall all be fulfilled

31
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,738
7 And because I said unto you that old things have

32
00:01:13,738 --> 00:01:16,405
 passed away, I do not destroy that which hath

33
00:01:16,405 --> 00:01:19,072
 been spoken concerning things which are to come

34
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:24,046
8 For behold, the covenant which I have made with

35
00:01:24,046 --> 00:01:29,046
 my people is not all fulfilled; but the law which

36
00:01:29,046 --> 00:01:34,046
 was given unto Moses hath an end in me

37
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:38,995
9 Behold, I am the law, and the light. Look unto

38
00:01:38,995 --> 00:01:42,995
 me, and endure to the end, and ye shall live; for

39
00:01:42,995 --> 00:01:46,995
 unto him that endureth to the end will I give

40
00:01:46,995 --> 00:01:50,995
 eternal life

41
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,944
10 Behold, I have given unto you the commandments;

42
00:01:52,944 --> 00:01:54,944
 therefore keep my commandments. And this is the

43
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,944
 law and the prophets, for they truly testified of

44
00:01:56,944 --> 00:01:58,944
 me

45
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:04,252
11 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had

46
00:02:04,252 --> 00:02:09,585
 spoken these words, he said unto those twelve whom he

47
00:02:09,585 --> 00:02:14,918
 had chosen

48
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:17,535
12 Ye are my disciples; and ye are a light unto

49
00:02:17,535 --> 00:02:20,202
 this people, who are a remnant of the house of

50
00:02:20,202 --> 00:02:22,869
 Joseph

51
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:26,843
13 And behold, this is the land of your

52
00:02:26,843 --> 00:02:30,843
 inheritance; and the Father hath given it unto you

53
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,484
14 And not at any time hath the Father given me

54
00:02:33,484 --> 00:02:36,151
 commandment that I should tell it unto your brethren

55
00:02:36,151 --> 00:02:38,818
 at Jerusalem

56
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:40,792
15 Neither at any time hath the Father given me

57
00:02:40,792 --> 00:02:42,792
 commandment that I should tell unto them concerning

58
00:02:42,792 --> 00:02:44,792
 the other tribes of the house of Israel, whom the

59
00:02:44,792 --> 00:02:46,792
 Father hath led away out of the land

60
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:50,767
16 This much did the Father command me, that I

61
00:02:50,767 --> 00:02:54,767
 should tell unto them

62
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:56,741
17 That other sheep I have which are not of this

63
00:02:56,741 --> 00:02:58,741
 fold; them also I must bring, and they shall hear

64
00:02:58,741 --> 00:03:00,741
 my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one

65
00:03:00,741 --> 00:03:02,741
 shepherd

66
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:04,716
18 And now, because of stiffneckedness and

67
00:03:04,716 --> 00:03:06,716
 unbelief they understood not my word; therefore I was

68
00:03:06,716 --> 00:03:08,716
 commanded to say no more of the Father concerning

69
00:03:08,716 --> 00:03:10,716
 this thing unto them

70
00:03:10,69 --> 00:03:13,89
19 But, verily, I say unto you that the Father

71
00:03:13,89 --> 00:03:17,09
 hath commanded me, and I tell it unto you, that ye

72
00:03:17,09 --> 00:03:20,29
 were separated from among them because of their

73
00:03:20,29 --> 00:03:23,49
 iniquity; therefore it is because of their iniquity

74
00:03:23,49 --> 00:03:26,69
 that they know not of you

75
00:03:26,64 --> 00:03:28,64
20 And verily, I say unto you again that the other

76
00:03:28,64 --> 00:03:30,64
 tribes hath the Father separated from them; and

77
00:03:30,64 --> 00:03:32,64
 it is because of their iniquity that they know not

78
00:03:32,64 --> 00:03:34,64
 of them

79
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,214
21 And verily I say unto you, that ye are they of

80
00:03:36,214 --> 00:03:37,814
 whom I said: Other sheep I have which are not of

81
00:03:37,814 --> 00:03:39,414
 this fold; them also I must bring, and they shall

82
00:03:39,414 --> 00:03:41,014
 hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one

83
00:03:41,014 --> 00:03:42,614
 shepherd

84
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,589
22 And they understood me not, for they supposed

85
00:03:44,589 --> 00:03:46,589
 it had been the Gentiles; for they understood not

86
00:03:46,589 --> 00:03:48,589
 that the Gentiles should be converted through their

87
00:03:48,589 --> 00:03:50,589
 preaching

88
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,164
23 And they understood me not that I said they

89
00:03:52,164 --> 00:03:53,764
 shall hear my voice; and they understood me not that

90
00:03:53,764 --> 00:03:55,364
 the Gentiles should not at any time hear my

91
00:03:55,364 --> 00:03:56,964
 voice—that I should not manifest myself unto them save

92
00:03:56,964 --> 00:03:58,564
 it were by the Holy Ghost

93
00:03:58,538 --> 00:03:58,871
24 But behold, ye have both heard my voice, and

94
00:03:58,871 --> 00:03:59,204
 seen me; and ye are my sheep, and ye are numbered

95
00:03:59,204 --> 00:03:59,537
 among those whom the Father hath given me.
