1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 15 Jesus announces that the law of Moses

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
is fulfilled in Him—The Nephites are the other

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
sheep of whom He spoke in Jerusalem—Because of

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
iniquity, the Lord’s people in Jerusalem do not know

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:07:29,
of the scattered sheep of Israel. About A.D. 34. 

6
00:07:29,0 --> 00:07:29,0
1 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had

7
00:07:29,0 --> 00:07:29,0
ended these sayings he cast his eyes round

8
00:07:29,0 --> 00:07:29,0
about on the multitude, and said unto them:

9
00:07:29,0 --> 00:07:29,0
Behold, ye have heard the things which I taught

10
00:07:29,0 --> 00:07:29,0
before I ascended to my Father; therefore,

11
00:07:29,0 --> 00:07:29,0
whoso remembereth these sayings of mine and

12
00:07:29,0 --> 00:13:39,
doeth them, him will I raise up at the last day.

13
00:13:39,0 --> 00:13:39,0
2 And it came to pass that when Jesus

14
00:13:39,0 --> 00:13:39,0
had said these words he perceived that

15
00:13:39,0 --> 00:13:39,0
there were some among them who marveled,

16
00:13:39,0 --> 00:13:39,0
and wondered what he would concerning

17
00:13:39,0 --> 00:13:39,0
the law of Moses; for they understood

18
00:13:39,0 --> 00:13:39,0
not the saying that old things had

19
00:13:39,0 --> 00:18:49,
passed away, and that all things had become new.

20
00:18:49,0 --> 00:18:49,0
3 And he said unto them: Marvel

21
00:18:49,0 --> 00:18:49,0
not that I said unto you that

22
00:18:49,0 --> 00:18:49,0
old things had passed away, and

23
00:18:49,0 --> 00:20:01,
that all things had become new.

24
00:20:01,0 --> 00:20:01,0
4 Behold, I say unto you

25
00:20:01,0 --> 00:20:01,0
that the law is fulfilled

26
00:20:01,0 --> 00:19:33,
that was given unto Moses.

27
00:19:33,0 --> 00:19:33,0
5 Behold, I am he that

28
00:19:33,0 --> 00:19:33,0
gave the law, and I am

29
00:19:33,0 --> 00:19:33,0
he who covenanted with

30
00:19:33,0 --> 00:19:33,0
my people Israel;

31
00:19:33,0 --> 00:19:33,0
therefore, the law in me is

32
00:19:33,0 --> 00:19:33,0
fulfilled, for I have

33
00:19:33,0 --> 00:19:33,0
come to fulfil the law;

34
00:19:33,0 --> 00:21:45,
therefore it hath an end.

35
00:21:45,0 --> 00:21:45,0
6 Behold, I do not

36
00:21:45,0 --> 00:21:45,0
destroy the prophets, for

37
00:21:45,0 --> 00:21:45,0
as many as have not

38
00:21:45,0 --> 00:21:45,0
been fulfilled in me,

39
00:21:45,0 --> 00:21:45,0
verily I say unto you,

40
00:21:45,0 --> 00:21:17,
shall all be fulfilled.

41
00:21:17,0 --> 00:21:17,0
7 And because I said

42
00:21:17,0 --> 00:21:17,0
unto you that old

43
00:21:17,0 --> 00:21:17,0
things have passed

44
00:21:17,0 --> 00:21:17,0
away, I do not destroy

45
00:21:17,0 --> 00:21:17,0
that which hath

46
00:21:17,0 --> 00:21:17,0
been spoken concerning

47
00:21:17,0 --> 00:20:49,
things which are to come.

48
00:20:49,0 --> 00:20:49,0
8 For behold, the

49
00:20:49,0 --> 00:20:49,0
covenant which I

50
00:20:49,0 --> 00:20:49,0
have made with my

51
00:20:49,0 --> 00:20:49,0
people is not all

52
00:20:49,0 --> 00:20:49,0
fulfilled; but the law

53
00:20:49,0 --> 00:20:49,0
which was given unto

54
00:20:49,0 --> 00:20:21,
Moses hath an end in me.

55
00:20:21,0 --> 00:20:21,0
9 Behold, I am

56
00:20:21,0 --> 00:20:21,0
the law, and the

57
00:20:21,0 --> 00:20:21,0
light. Look unto

58
00:20:21,0 --> 00:20:21,0
me, and endure to

59
00:20:21,0 --> 00:20:21,0
the end, and ye

60
00:20:21,0 --> 00:20:21,0
shall live; for

61
00:20:21,0 --> 00:20:21,0
unto him that

62
00:20:21,0 --> 00:20:21,0
endureth to the end

63
00:20:21,0 --> 00:21:33,
will I give eternal life.

64
00:21:33,0 --> 00:21:33,0
10 Behold, I

65
00:21:33,0 --> 00:21:33,0
have given unto you

66
00:21:33,0 --> 00:21:33,0
the

67
00:21:33,0 --> 00:21:33,0
commandments; therefore

68
00:21:33,0 --> 00:21:33,0
keep my

69
00:21:33,0 --> 00:21:33,0
commandments. And this is

70
00:21:33,0 --> 00:21:33,0
the law and the

71
00:21:33,0 --> 00:21:33,0
prophets, for

72
00:21:33,0 --> 00:21:05,
they truly testified of me.

73
00:21:05,0 --> 00:21:05,0
11 And now it

74
00:21:05,0 --> 00:21:05,0
came to pass that

75
00:21:05,0 --> 00:21:05,0
when Jesus had

76
00:21:05,0 --> 00:21:05,0
spoken these

77
00:21:05,0 --> 00:21:05,0
words, he said unto

78
00:21:05,0 --> 00:21:05,0
those twelve

79
00:21:05,0 --> 00:20:37,
whom he had chosen:

80
00:20:37,0 --> 00:20:37,0
12 Ye are my

81
00:20:37,0 --> 00:20:37,0
disciples; and

82
00:20:37,0 --> 00:20:37,0
ye are a light

83
00:20:37,0 --> 00:20:37,0
unto this

84
00:20:37,0 --> 00:20:37,0
people, who are a

85
00:20:37,0 --> 00:20:37,0
remnant of

86
00:20:37,0 --> 00:20:09,
the house of Joseph.

87
00:20:09,0 --> 00:20:09,0
13 And

88
00:20:09,0 --> 00:20:09,0
behold, this is the

89
00:20:09,0 --> 00:20:09,0
land of your

90
00:20:09,0 --> 00:20:09,0
inheritance;

91
00:20:09,0 --> 00:20:09,0
and the

92
00:20:09,0 --> 00:20:09,0
Father hath given

93
00:20:09,0 --> 00:21:21,
it unto you.

94
00:21:21,0 --> 00:21:21,0
14 And not

95
00:21:21,0 --> 00:21:21,0
at any time

96
00:21:21,0 --> 00:21:21,0
hath the

97
00:21:21,0 --> 00:21:21,0
Father given me

98
00:21:21,0 --> 00:21:21,0
commandment

99
00:21:21,0 --> 00:21:21,0
that I

100
00:21:21,0 --> 00:21:21,0
should tell it

101
00:21:21,0 --> 00:21:21,0
unto your

102
00:21:21,0 --> 00:29:05,
brethren at Jerusalem.

103
00:29:05,0 --> 00:29:05,0
15 Neither

104
00:29:05,0 --> 00:29:05,0
at any time

105
00:29:05,0 --> 00:29:05,0
hath the

106
00:29:05,0 --> 00:29:05,0
Father given

107
00:29:05,0 --> 00:29:05,0
me

108
00:29:05,0 --> 00:29:05,0
commandment that I

109
00:29:05,0 --> 00:29:05,0
should

110
00:29:05,0 --> 00:29:05,0
tell unto them

111
00:29:05,0 --> 00:29:05,0
concerning

112
00:29:05,0 --> 00:29:05,0
the other

113
00:29:05,0 --> 00:29:05,0
tribes of

114
00:29:05,0 --> 00:29:05,0
the house of

115
00:29:05,0 --> 00:29:05,0
Israel,

116
00:29:05,0 --> 00:29:05,0
whom the

117
00:29:05,0 --> 00:29:05,0
Father hath led

118
00:29:05,0 --> 00:40:48,
away out of the land.

119
00:40:48,0 --> 00:40:48,0
16 This

120
00:40:48,0 --> 00:40:48,0
much did

121
00:40:48,0 --> 00:40:48,0
the Father

122
00:40:48,0 --> 00:40:48,0
command

123
00:40:48,0 --> 00:40:48,0
me, that

124
00:40:48,0 --> 00:40:48,0
I should

125
00:40:48,0 --> 00:44:18,
tell unto them:

126
00:44:18,0 --> 00:44:18,0
17 That

127
00:44:18,0 --> 00:44:18,0
other

128
00:44:18,0 --> 00:44:18,0
sheep I

129
00:44:18,0 --> 00:44:18,0
have which

130
00:44:18,0 --> 00:44:18,0
are not

131
00:44:18,0 --> 00:44:18,0
of this

132
00:44:18,0 --> 00:44:18,0
fold;

133
00:44:18,0 --> 00:44:18,0
them also

134
00:44:18,0 --> 00:44:18,0
I must

135
00:44:18,0 --> 00:44:18,0
bring,

136
00:44:18,0 --> 00:44:18,0
and they

137
00:44:18,0 --> 00:44:18,0
shall

138
00:44:18,0 --> 00:44:18,0
hear my

139
00:44:18,0 --> 00:44:18,0
voice; and

140
00:44:18,0 --> 00:44:18,0
there

141
00:44:18,0 --> 00:44:18,0
shall be

142
00:44:18,0 --> 00:44:18,0
one

143
00:44:18,0 --> 00:43:50,
fold, and one shepherd.

144
00:43:50,0 --> 00:43:50,0
18 And

145
00:43:50,0 --> 00:43:50,0
now,

146
00:43:50,0 --> 00:43:50,0
because of

147
00:43:50,0 --> 00:43:50,0


148
00:43:50,0 --> 00:43:50,0
stiffneckedness

149
00:43:50,0 --> 00:43:50,0
and

150
00:43:50,0 --> 00:43:50,0
unbelief they

151
00:43:50,0 --> 00:43:50,0


152
00:43:50,0 --> 00:43:50,0
understood not

153
00:43:50,0 --> 00:43:50,0
my word;

154
00:43:50,0 --> 00:43:50,0


155
00:43:50,0 --> 00:43:50,0
therefore I was

156
00:43:50,0 --> 00:43:50,0


157
00:43:50,0 --> 00:43:50,0
commanded to

158
00:43:50,0 --> 00:43:50,0
say no

159
00:43:50,0 --> 00:43:50,0
more of the

160
00:43:50,0 --> 00:43:50,0
Father

161
00:43:50,0 --> 00:43:50,0


162
00:43:50,0 --> 00:43:50,0
concerning this

163
00:43:50,0 --> 00:43:50,0
thing

164
00:43:50,0 --> 00:49:00,
unto them.

165
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
19 But,

166
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
verily,

167
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
I say

168
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
unto you

169
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
that the

170
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
Father

171
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
hath

172
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
commanded

173
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
me, and I

174
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
tell it

175
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
unto

176
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
you, that

177
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
ye were

178
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
separated

179
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
from

180
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
among them

181
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
because

182
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
of

183
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
their

184
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
iniquity;

185
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
therefore it

186
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
is

187
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
because of

188
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
their

189
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
iniquity

190
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
that they

191
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
know not

192
00:49:00,0 --> 00:50:12,
of you.

193
00:50:12,0 --> 00:50:12,0
20 And

194
00:50:12,0 --> 00:50:12,0
verily,

195
00:50:12,0 --> 00:50:12,0
I say

196
00:50:12,0 --> 00:50:12,0
unto

197
00:50:12,0 --> 00:50:12,0
you again

198
00:50:12,0 --> 00:50:12,0
that

199
00:50:12,0 --> 00:50:12,0
the

200
00:50:12,0 --> 00:50:12,0
other

201
00:50:12,0 --> 00:50:12,0
tribes hath

202
00:50:12,0 --> 00:50:12,0
the

203
00:50:12,0 --> 00:50:12,0
Father

204
00:50:12,0 --> 00:50:12,0
separated

205
00:50:12,0 --> 00:50:12,0
from

206
00:50:12,0 --> 00:50:12,0
them; and

207
00:50:12,0 --> 00:50:12,0
it is

208
00:50:12,0 --> 00:50:12,0
because

209
00:50:12,0 --> 00:50:12,0
of

210
00:50:12,0 --> 00:50:12,0
their

211
00:50:12,0 --> 00:50:12,0
iniquity

212
00:50:12,0 --> 00:52:24,
that they know not of them.

213
00:52:24,0 --> 00:52:24,0
21 And

214
00:52:24,0 --> 00:52:24,0
verily

215
00:52:24,0 --> 00:52:24,0
I say

216
00:52:24,0 --> 00:52:24,0
unto

217
00:52:24,0 --> 00:52:24,0
you, that

218
00:52:24,0 --> 00:52:24,0
ye are

219
00:52:24,0 --> 00:52:24,0
they of

220
00:52:24,0 --> 00:52:24,0
whom I

221
00:52:24,0 --> 00:52:24,0
said:

222
00:52:24,0 --> 00:52:24,0
Other

223
00:52:24,0 --> 00:52:24,0
sheep I

224
00:52:24,0 --> 00:52:24,0
have

225
00:52:24,0 --> 00:52:24,0
which are

226
00:52:24,0 --> 00:52:24,0
not of

227
00:52:24,0 --> 00:52:24,0

243
00:51:56,0 --> 00:51:56,0
22 And
