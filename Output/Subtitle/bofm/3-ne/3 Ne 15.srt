00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:03,6
Chapter 15 Jesus announces that the law of Moses

2
00:00:03,6 --> 00:00:07,2
is fulfilled in Him—The Nephites are the other

3
00:00:07,2 --> 00:00:10,8
sheep of whom He spoke in Jerusalem—Because of

4
00:00:10,8 --> 00:00:14,4
iniquity, the Lord’s people in Jerusalem do not know

5
00:00:14,4 --> 00:00:18,318
of the scattered sheep of Israel. About A.D. 34. 

6
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:19,032
1 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had

7
00:00:19,032 --> 00:00:19,746
ended these sayings he cast his eyes round

8
00:00:19,746 --> 00:00:20,46
about on the multitude, and said unto them:

9
00:00:20,46 --> 00:00:21,174
Behold, ye have heard the things which I taught

10
00:00:21,174 --> 00:00:21,888
before I ascended to my Father; therefore,

11
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:22,602
whoso remembereth these sayings of mine and

12
00:00:22,602 --> 00:00:23,724
doeth them, him will I raise up at the last day.

13
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:24,724
2 And it came to pass that when Jesus

14
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:25,724
had said these words he perceived that

15
00:00:25,724 --> 00:00:26,724
there were some among them who marveled,

16
00:00:26,724 --> 00:00:27,724
and wondered what he would concerning

17
00:00:27,724 --> 00:00:28,724
the law of Moses; for they understood

18
00:00:28,724 --> 00:00:29,724
not the saying that old things had

19
00:00:29,724 --> 00:00:30,731
passed away, and that all things had become new.

20
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:31,731
3 And he said unto them: Marvel

21
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:32,731
not that I said unto you that

22
00:00:32,731 --> 00:00:33,731
old things had passed away, and

23
00:00:33,731 --> 00:00:34,201
that all things had become new.

24
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:36,534
4 Behold, I say unto you

25
00:00:36,534 --> 00:00:38,867
that the law is fulfilled

26
00:00:38,867 --> 00:00:41,241
that was given unto Moses.

27
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:46,241
5 Behold, I am he that

28
00:00:46,241 --> 00:00:51,241
gave the law, and I am

29
00:00:51,241 --> 00:00:56,241
he who covenanted with

30
00:00:56,241 --> 00:01:01,241
my people Israel;

31
00:01:01,241 --> 00:01:06,241
therefore, the law in me is

32
00:01:06,241 --> 00:01:11,241
fulfilled, for I have

33
00:01:11,241 --> 00:01:16,241
come to fulfil the law;

34
00:01:16,241 --> 00:01:21,582
therefore it hath an end.

35
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:29,249
6 Behold, I do not

36
00:01:29,249 --> 00:01:36,916
destroy the prophets, for

37
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:44,583
as many as have not

38
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:52,25
been fulfilled in me,

39
00:01:52,25 --> 00:01:59,917
verily I say unto you,

40
00:01:59,917 --> 00:02:07,794
shall all be fulfilled.

41
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:08,937
7 And because I said

42
00:02:08,937 --> 00:02:10,08
unto you that old

43
00:02:10,08 --> 00:02:11,223
things have passed

44
00:02:11,223 --> 00:02:12,366
away, I do not destroy

45
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:13,509
that which hath

46
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:14,652
been spoken concerning

47
00:02:14,652 --> 00:02:15,302
things which are to come.

48
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:16,731
8 For behold, the

49
00:02:16,731 --> 00:02:18,16
covenant which I

50
00:02:18,16 --> 00:02:19,589
have made with my

51
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:21,018
people is not all

52
00:02:21,018 --> 00:02:22,447
fulfilled; but the law

53
00:02:22,447 --> 00:02:23,876
which was given unto

54
00:02:23,876 --> 00:02:25,212
Moses hath an end in me.

55
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:25,656
9 Behold, I am

56
00:02:25,656 --> 00:02:26,1
the law, and the

57
00:02:26,1 --> 00:02:26,544
light. Look unto

58
00:02:26,544 --> 00:02:26,988
me, and endure to

59
00:02:26,988 --> 00:02:27,432
the end, and ye

60
00:02:27,432 --> 00:02:27,876
shall live; for

61
00:02:27,876 --> 00:02:28,32
unto him that

62
00:02:28,32 --> 00:02:28,764
endureth to the end

63
00:02:28,764 --> 00:02:29,616
will I give eternal life.

64
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:32,505
10 Behold, I

65
00:02:32,505 --> 00:02:35,394
have given unto you

66
00:02:35,394 --> 00:02:38,283
the

67
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,172
commandments; therefore

68
00:02:41,172 --> 00:02:44,061
keep my

69
00:02:44,061 --> 00:02:46,95
commandments. And this is

70
00:02:46,95 --> 00:02:49,839
the law and the

71
00:02:49,839 --> 00:02:52,728
prophets, for

72
00:02:52,728 --> 00:02:55,942
they truly testified of me.

73
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:58,085
11 And now it

74
00:02:58,085 --> 00:03:00,228
came to pass that

75
00:03:00,228 --> 00:03:02,371
when Jesus had

76
00:03:02,371 --> 00:03:04,514
spoken these

77
00:03:04,514 --> 00:03:06,657
words, he said unto

78
00:03:06,657 --> 00:03:08,8
those twelve

79
00:03:08,8 --> 00:03:10,223
whom he had chosen:

80
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:11,223
12 Ye are my

81
00:03:11,223 --> 00:03:12,223
disciples; and

82
00:03:12,223 --> 00:03:13,223
ye are a light

83
00:03:13,223 --> 00:03:14,223
unto this

84
00:03:14,223 --> 00:03:15,223
people, who are a

85
00:03:15,223 --> 00:03:16,223
remnant of

86
00:03:16,223 --> 00:03:17,264
the house of Joseph.

87
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:17,835
13 And

88
00:03:17,835 --> 00:03:18,406
behold, this is the

89
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:18,977
land of your

90
00:03:18,977 --> 00:03:19,548
inheritance;

91
00:03:19,548 --> 00:03:20,119
and the

92
00:03:20,119 --> 00:03:20,69
Father hath given

93
00:03:20,69 --> 00:03:21,668
it unto you.

94
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:22,446
14 And not

95
00:03:22,446 --> 00:03:23,224
at any time

96
00:03:23,224 --> 00:03:24,002
hath the

97
00:03:24,002 --> 00:03:24,78
Father given me

98
00:03:24,78 --> 00:03:25,558
commandment

99
00:03:25,558 --> 00:03:26,336
that I

100
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,114
should tell it

101
00:03:27,114 --> 00:03:27,892
unto your

102
00:03:27,892 --> 00:03:28,008
brethren at Jerusalem.

103
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:28,258
15 Neither

104
00:03:28,258 --> 00:03:28,508
at any time

105
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:28,758
hath the

106
00:03:28,758 --> 00:03:29,008
Father given

107
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:29,258
me

108
00:03:29,258 --> 00:03:29,508
commandment that I

109
00:03:29,508 --> 00:03:29,758
should

110
00:03:29,758 --> 00:03:30,008
tell unto them

111
00:03:30,008 --> 00:03:30,258
concerning

112
00:03:30,258 --> 00:03:30,508
the other

113
00:03:30,508 --> 00:03:30,758
tribes of

114
00:03:30,758 --> 00:03:31,008
the house of

115
00:03:31,008 --> 00:03:31,258
Israel,

116
00:03:31,258 --> 00:03:31,508
whom the

117
00:03:31,508 --> 00:03:31,758
Father hath led

118
00:03:31,758 --> 00:03:32,412
away out of the land.

119
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:33,698
16 This

120
00:03:33,698 --> 00:03:34,984
much did

121
00:03:34,984 --> 00:03:36,27
the Father

122
00:03:36,27 --> 00:03:37,556
command

123
00:03:37,556 --> 00:03:38,842
me, that

124
00:03:38,842 --> 00:03:40,128
I should

125
00:03:40,128 --> 00:03:41,855
tell unto them:

126
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:42,411
17 That

127
00:03:42,411 --> 00:03:42,967
other

128
00:03:42,967 --> 00:03:43,523
sheep I

129
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:44,079
have which

130
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:44,635
are not

131
00:03:44,635 --> 00:03:45,191
of this

132
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:45,747
fold;

133
00:03:45,747 --> 00:03:46,303
them also

134
00:03:46,303 --> 00:03:46,859
I must

135
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:47,415
bring,

136
00:03:47,415 --> 00:03:47,971
and they

137
00:03:47,971 --> 00:03:48,527
shall

138
00:03:48,527 --> 00:03:49,083
hear my

139
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:49,639
voice; and

140
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:50,195
there

141
00:03:50,195 --> 00:03:50,751
shall be

142
00:03:50,751 --> 00:03:51,307
one

143
00:03:51,307 --> 00:03:51,765
fold, and one shepherd.

144
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:52,86
18 And

145
00:03:52,86 --> 00:03:53,955
now,

146
00:03:53,955 --> 00:03:55,05
because of

147
00:03:55,05 --> 00:03:56,145


148
00:03:56,145 --> 00:03:57,24
stiffneckedness

149
00:03:57,24 --> 00:03:58,335
and

150
00:03:58,335 --> 00:03:59,43
unbelief they

151
00:03:59,43 --> 00:04:00,525


152
00:04:00,525 --> 00:04:01,62
understood not

153
00:04:01,62 --> 00:04:02,715
my word;

154
00:04:02,715 --> 00:04:03,81


155
00:04:03,81 --> 00:04:04,905
therefore I was

156
00:04:04,905 --> 00:04:05,0


157
00:04:05,0 --> 00:04:07,095
commanded to

158
00:04:07,095 --> 00:04:08,19
say no

159
00:04:08,19 --> 00:04:09,285
more of the

160
00:04:09,285 --> 00:04:10,38
Father

161
00:04:10,38 --> 00:04:11,475


162
00:04:11,475 --> 00:04:12,57
concerning this

163
00:04:12,57 --> 00:04:13,665
thing

164
00:04:13,665 --> 00:04:14,02
unto them.

165
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
19 But,

166
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
verily,

167
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
I say

168
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
unto you

169
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
that the

170
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
Father

171
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
hath

172
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
commanded

173
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
me, and I

174
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
tell it

175
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
unto

176
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
you, that

177
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
ye were

178
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
separated

179
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
from

180
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
among them

181
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
because

182
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
of

183
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
their

184
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
iniquity;

185
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
therefore it

186
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
is

187
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
because of

188
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
their

189
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
iniquity

190
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
that they

191
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
know not

192
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
of you.

193
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
20 And

194
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
verily,

195
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
I say

196
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
unto

197
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
you again

198
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
that

199
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
the

200
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
other

201
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
tribes hath

202
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
the

203
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
Father

204
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
separated

205
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
from

206
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
them; and

207
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
it is

208
