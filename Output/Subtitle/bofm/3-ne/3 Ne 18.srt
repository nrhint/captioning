1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,4
Chapter 18 Jesus institutes the sacrament among

2
00:00:01,4 --> 00:00:02,8
 the Nephites—They are commanded to pray always in

3
00:00:02,8 --> 00:00:04,2
 His name—Those who eat His flesh and drink His blood

4
00:00:04,2 --> 00:00:05,6
 unworthily are damned—The disciples are given

5
00:00:05,6 --> 00:00:07,0
 power to confer the Holy Ghost. About A.D. 34.

6
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:10,642
1 And it came to pass that Jesus commanded his

7
00:00:10,642 --> 00:00:13,309
 disciples that they should bring forth some bread and

8
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:15,976
 wine unto him

9
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:21,282
2 And while they were gone for bread and wine, he

10
00:00:21,282 --> 00:00:26,615
 commanded the multitude that they should sit

11
00:00:26,615 --> 00:00:31,948
 themselves down upon the earth

12
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,899
3 And when the disciples had come with bread and

13
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,899
 wine, he took of the bread and brake and blessed

14
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:37,899
 it; and he gave unto the disciples and commanded

15
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:39,899
 that they should eat

16
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:43,873
4 And when they had eaten and were filled, he

17
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:47,873
 commanded that they should give unto the multitude

18
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,181
5 And when the multitude had eaten and were

19
00:00:49,181 --> 00:00:50,514
 filled, he said unto the disciples: Behold there shall

20
00:00:50,514 --> 00:00:51,847
 one be ordained among you, and to him will I give

21
00:00:51,847 --> 00:00:53,18
 power that he shall break bread and bless it and

22
00:00:53,18 --> 00:00:54,513
 give it unto the people of my church, unto all those

23
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:55,846
 who shall believe and be baptized in my name

24
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:58,489
6 And this shall ye always observe to do, even as

25
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:01,156
 I have done, even as I have broken bread and

26
00:01:01,156 --> 00:01:03,823
 blessed it and given it unto you

27
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,397
7 And this shall ye do in remembrance of my body,

28
00:01:05,397 --> 00:01:06,997
 which I have shown unto you. And it shall be a

29
00:01:06,997 --> 00:01:08,597
 testimony unto the Father that ye do always remember

30
00:01:08,597 --> 00:01:10,197
 me. And if ye do always remember me ye shall have

31
00:01:10,197 --> 00:01:11,797
 my Spirit to be with you

32
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:13,372
8 And it came to pass that when he said these

33
00:01:13,372 --> 00:01:14,972
 words, he commanded his disciples that they should

34
00:01:14,972 --> 00:01:16,572
 take of the wine of the cup and drink of it, and that

35
00:01:16,572 --> 00:01:18,172
 they should also give unto the multitude that

36
00:01:18,172 --> 00:01:19,772
 they might drink of it

37
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,746
9 And it came to pass that they did so, and did

38
00:01:21,746 --> 00:01:23,746
 drink of it and were filled; and they gave unto the

39
00:01:23,746 --> 00:01:25,746
 multitude, and they did drink, and they were

40
00:01:25,746 --> 00:01:27,746
 filled

41
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:29,321
10 And when the disciples had done this, Jesus

42
00:01:29,321 --> 00:01:30,921
 said unto them: Blessed are ye for this thing which

43
00:01:30,921 --> 00:01:32,521
 ye have done, for this is fulfilling my

44
00:01:32,521 --> 00:01:34,121
 commandments, and this doth witness unto the Father that ye

45
00:01:34,121 --> 00:01:35,721
 are willing to do that which I have commanded you

46
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,029
11 And this shall ye always do to those who repent

47
00:01:37,029 --> 00:01:38,362
 and are baptized in my name; and ye shall do it

48
00:01:38,362 --> 00:01:39,695
 in remembrance of my blood, which I have shed for

49
00:01:39,695 --> 00:01:41,028
 you, that ye may witness unto the Father that ye do

50
00:01:41,028 --> 00:01:42,361
 always remember me. And if ye do always remember

51
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:43,694
 me ye shall have my Spirit to be with you

52
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:45,67
12 And I give unto you a commandment that ye shall

53
00:01:45,67 --> 00:01:47,67
 do these things. And if ye shall always do these

54
00:01:47,67 --> 00:01:49,67
 things blessed are ye, for ye are built upon my

55
00:01:49,67 --> 00:01:51,67
 rock

56
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:52,978
13 But whoso among you shall do more or less than

57
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:54,311
 these are not built upon my rock, but are built

58
00:01:54,311 --> 00:01:55,644
 upon a sandy foundation; and when the rain descends,

59
00:01:55,644 --> 00:01:56,977
 and the floods come, and the winds blow, and beat

60
00:01:56,977 --> 00:01:58,31
 upon them, they shall fall, and the gates of hell

61
00:01:58,31 --> 00:01:59,643
 are ready open to receive them

62
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:02,287
14 Therefore blessed are ye if ye shall keep my

63
00:02:02,287 --> 00:02:04,954
 commandments, which the Father hath commanded me

64
00:02:04,954 --> 00:02:07,621
 that I should give unto you

65
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:10,261
15 Verily, verily, I say unto you, ye must watch

66
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:12,928
 and pray always, lest ye be tempted by the devil,

67
00:02:12,928 --> 00:02:15,595
 and ye be led away captive by him

68
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:17,569
16 And as I have prayed among you even so shall ye

69
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:19,569
 pray in my church, among my people who do repent

70
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:21,569
 and are baptized in my name. Behold I am the

71
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:23,569
 light; I have set an example for you

72
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:26,21
17 And it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken

73
00:02:26,21 --> 00:02:28,877
 these words unto his disciples, he turned again

74
00:02:28,877 --> 00:02:31,544
 unto the multitude and said unto them

75
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,518
18 Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, ye must

76
00:02:33,518 --> 00:02:35,518
 watch and pray always lest ye enter into

77
00:02:35,518 --> 00:02:37,518
 temptation; for Satan desireth to have you, that he may

78
00:02:37,518 --> 00:02:39,518
 sift you as wheat

79
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:43,493
19 Therefore ye must always pray unto the Father

80
00:02:43,493 --> 00:02:47,493
 in my name

81
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:50,134
20 And whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my

82
00:02:50,134 --> 00:02:52,801
 name, which is right, believing that ye shall

83
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:55,468
 receive, behold it shall be given unto you

84
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:58,109
21 Pray in your families unto the Father, always

85
00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:00,776
 in my name, that your wives and your children may

86
00:03:00,776 --> 00:03:03,443
 be blessed

87
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,417
22 And behold, ye shall meet together oft; and ye

88
00:03:05,417 --> 00:03:07,417
 shall not forbid any man from coming unto you when

89
00:03:07,417 --> 00:03:09,417
 ye shall meet together, but suffer them that they

90
00:03:09,417 --> 00:03:11,417
 may come unto you and forbid them not

91
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,391
23 But ye shall pray for them, and shall not cast

92
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:15,391
 them out; and if it so be that they come unto you

93
00:03:15,391 --> 00:03:17,391
 oft ye shall pray for them unto the Father, in my

94
00:03:17,391 --> 00:03:19,391
 name

95
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,966
24 Therefore, hold up your light that it may shine

96
00:03:20,966 --> 00:03:22,566
 unto the world. Behold I am the light which ye

97
00:03:22,566 --> 00:03:24,166
 shall hold up—that which ye have seen me do. Behold

98
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,766
 ye see that I have prayed unto the Father, and ye

99
00:03:25,766 --> 00:03:27,366
 all have witnessed

100
00:03:27,34 --> 00:03:28,673
25 And ye see that I have commanded that none of

101
00:03:28,673 --> 00:03:30,006
 you should go away, but rather have commanded that

102
00:03:30,006 --> 00:03:31,339
 ye should come unto me, that ye might feel and

103
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:32,672
 see; even so shall ye do unto the world; and

104
00:03:32,672 --> 00:03:34,005
 whosoever breaketh this commandment suffereth himself to

105
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,338
 be led into temptation

106
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,315
26 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had

107
00:03:37,315 --> 00:03:39,315
 spoken these words, he turned his eyes again upon the

108
00:03:39,315 --> 00:03:41,315
 disciples whom he had chosen, and said unto them

109
00:03:41,315 --> 00:03:43,315


110
00:03:43,29 --> 00:03:45,29
27 Behold verily, verily, I say unto you, I give

111
00:03:45,29 --> 00:03:47,29
 unto you another commandment, and then I must go

112
00:03:47,29 --> 00:03:49,29
 unto my Father that I may fulfil other commandments

113
00:03:49,29 --> 00:03:51,29
 which he hath given me

114
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,264
28 And now behold, this is the commandment which I

115
00:03:53,264 --> 00:03:55,264
 give unto you, that ye shall not suffer any one

116
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,264
 knowingly to partake of my flesh and blood

117
00:03:57,264 --> 00:03:59,264
 unworthily, when ye shall minister it

118
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,839
29 For whoso eateth and drinketh my flesh and

119
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:02,439
 blood unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to his

120
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:04,039
 soul; therefore if ye know that a man is unworthy

121
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,639
 to eat and drink of my flesh and blood ye shall

122
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:07,239
 forbid him

123
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:08,547
30 Nevertheless, ye shall not cast him out from

124
00:04:08,547 --> 00:04:09,88
 among you, but ye shall minister unto him and shall

125
00:04:09,88 --> 00:04:11,213
 pray for him unto the Father, in my name; and if

126
00:04:11,213 --> 00:04:12,546
 it so be that he repenteth and is baptized in my

127
00:04:12,546 --> 00:04:13,879
 name, then shall ye receive him, and shall minister

128
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,212
 unto him of my flesh and blood

129
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,188
31 But if he repent not he shall not be numbered

130
00:04:17,188 --> 00:04:19,188
 among my people, that he may not destroy my people,

131
00:04:19,188 --> 00:04:21,188
 for behold I know my sheep, and they are

132
00:04:21,188 --> 00:04:23,188
 numbered

133
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:24,306
32 Nevertheless, ye shall not cast him out of your

134
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:25,449
 synagogues, or your places of worship, for unto

135
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:26,592
 such shall ye continue to minister; for ye know not

136
00:04:26,592 --> 00:04:27,735
 but what they will return and repent, and come

137
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:28,878
 unto me with full purpose of heart, and I shall heal

138
00:04:28,878 --> 00:04:30,021
 them; and ye shall be the means of bringing

139
00:04:30,021 --> 00:04:31,164
 salvation unto them

140
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:33,805
33 Therefore, keep these sayings which I have

141
00:04:33,805 --> 00:04:36,472
 commanded you that ye come not under condemnation; for

142
00:04:36,472 --> 00:04:39,139
 wo unto him whom the Father condemneth

143
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,779
34 And I give you these commandments because of

144
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:44,446
 the disputations which have been among you. And

145
00:04:44,446 --> 00:04:47,113
 blessed are ye if ye have no disputations among you

146
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,754
35 And now I go unto the Father, because it is

147
00:04:49,754 --> 00:04:52,421
 expedient that I should go unto the Father for your

148
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:55,088
 sakes

149
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,661
36 And it came to pass that when Jesus had made an

150
00:04:56,661 --> 00:04:58,261
 end of these sayings, he touched with his hand

151
00:04:58,261 --> 00:04:59,861
 the disciples whom he had chosen, one by one, even

152
00:04:59,861 --> 00:05:01,461
 until he had touched them all, and spake unto them

153
00:05:01,461 --> 00:05:03,061
 as he touched them

154
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,636
37 And the multitude heard not the words which he

155
00:05:04,636 --> 00:05:06,236
 spake, therefore they did not bear record; but the

156
00:05:06,236 --> 00:05:07,836
 disciples bare record that he gave them power to

157
00:05:07,836 --> 00:05:09,436
 give the Holy Ghost. And I will show unto you

158
00:05:09,436 --> 00:05:11,036
 hereafter that this record is true

159
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:13,344
38 And it came to pass that when Jesus had touched

160
00:05:13,344 --> 00:05:15,677
 them all, there came a cloud and overshadowed the

161
00:05:15,677 --> 00:05:18,01
 multitude that they could not see Jesus

162
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,985
39 And while they were overshadowed he departed

163
00:05:20,985 --> 00:05:22,985
 from them, and ascended into heaven. And the

164
00:05:22,985 --> 00:05:24,985
 disciples saw and did bear record that he ascended again

165
00:05:24,985 --> 00:05:26,985
 into heaven.
