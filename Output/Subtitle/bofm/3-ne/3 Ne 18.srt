1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 18 Jesus institutes the sacrament among

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Nephites—They are commanded to pray always

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
in His name—Those who eat His flesh and drink His

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
blood unworthily are damned—The disciples are

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:21:06,
given power to confer the Holy Ghost. About A.D. 34. 

6
00:21:06,0 --> 00:21:06,0
1 And it came to pass that Jesus

7
00:21:06,0 --> 00:21:06,0
commanded his disciples that they should

8
00:21:06,0 --> 00:22:18,
bring forth some bread and wine unto him.

9
00:22:18,0 --> 00:22:18,0
2 And while they were gone for

10
00:22:18,0 --> 00:22:18,0
bread and wine, he commanded

11
00:22:18,0 --> 00:22:18,0
the multitude that they should

12
00:22:18,0 --> 00:21:50,
sit themselves down upon the earth.

13
00:21:50,0 --> 00:21:50,0
3 And when the disciples had

14
00:21:50,0 --> 00:21:50,0
come with bread and wine,

15
00:21:50,0 --> 00:21:50,0
he took of the bread and

16
00:21:50,0 --> 00:21:50,0
brake and blessed it; and he

17
00:21:50,0 --> 00:21:50,0
gave unto the disciples and

18
00:21:50,0 --> 00:21:22,
commanded that they should eat.

19
00:21:22,0 --> 00:21:22,0
4 And when they had

20
00:21:22,0 --> 00:21:22,0
eaten and were filled, he

21
00:21:22,0 --> 00:21:22,0
commanded that they should

22
00:21:22,0 --> 00:22:34,
give unto the multitude.

23
00:22:34,0 --> 00:22:34,0
5 And when the

24
00:22:34,0 --> 00:22:34,0
multitude had eaten and were

25
00:22:34,0 --> 00:22:34,0
filled, he said unto

26
00:22:34,0 --> 00:22:34,0
the disciples: Behold

27
00:22:34,0 --> 00:22:34,0
there shall one be

28
00:22:34,0 --> 00:22:34,0
ordained among you, and to

29
00:22:34,0 --> 00:22:34,0
him will I give power

30
00:22:34,0 --> 00:22:34,0
that he shall break

31
00:22:34,0 --> 00:22:34,0
bread and bless it and

32
00:22:34,0 --> 00:22:34,0
give it unto the

33
00:22:34,0 --> 00:22:34,0
people of my church, unto

34
00:22:34,0 --> 00:22:34,0
all those who shall

35
00:22:34,0 --> 00:27:45,
believe and be baptized in my name.

36
00:27:45,0 --> 00:27:45,0
6 And this shall ye

37
00:27:45,0 --> 00:27:45,0
always observe to do,

38
00:27:45,0 --> 00:27:45,0
even as I have done,

39
00:27:45,0 --> 00:27:45,0
even as I have broken

40
00:27:45,0 --> 00:27:45,0
bread and blessed it

41
00:27:45,0 --> 00:33:55,
and given it unto you.

42
00:33:55,0 --> 00:33:55,0
7 And this shall ye

43
00:33:55,0 --> 00:33:55,0
do in remembrance of

44
00:33:55,0 --> 00:33:55,0
my body, which I

45
00:33:55,0 --> 00:33:55,0
have shown unto you.

46
00:33:55,0 --> 00:33:55,0
And it shall be a

47
00:33:55,0 --> 00:33:55,0
testimony unto the

48
00:33:55,0 --> 00:33:55,0
Father that ye do always

49
00:33:55,0 --> 00:33:55,0
remember me. And if

50
00:33:55,0 --> 00:33:55,0
ye do always

51
00:33:55,0 --> 00:33:55,0
remember me ye shall have

52
00:33:55,0 --> 00:38:52,
my Spirit to be with you.

53
00:38:52,0 --> 00:38:52,0
8 And it came to

54
00:38:52,0 --> 00:38:52,0
pass that when he said

55
00:38:52,0 --> 00:38:52,0
these words, he

56
00:38:52,0 --> 00:38:52,0
commanded his disciples

57
00:38:52,0 --> 00:38:52,0
that they should

58
00:38:52,0 --> 00:38:52,0
take of the wine of the

59
00:38:52,0 --> 00:38:52,0
cup and drink of

60
00:38:52,0 --> 00:38:52,0
it, and that they

61
00:38:52,0 --> 00:38:52,0
should also give unto

62
00:38:52,0 --> 00:38:52,0
the multitude that

63
00:38:52,0 --> 00:42:22,
they might drink of it.

64
00:42:22,0 --> 00:42:22,0
9 And it came to

65
00:42:22,0 --> 00:42:22,0
pass that they did

66
00:42:22,0 --> 00:42:22,0
so, and did drink of

67
00:42:22,0 --> 00:42:22,0
it and were filled;

68
00:42:22,0 --> 00:42:22,0
and they gave unto

69
00:42:22,0 --> 00:42:22,0
the multitude, and

70
00:42:22,0 --> 00:42:22,0
they did drink,

71
00:42:22,0 --> 00:44:34,
and they were filled.

72
00:44:34,0 --> 00:44:34,0
10 And when the

73
00:44:34,0 --> 00:44:34,0
disciples had done

74
00:44:34,0 --> 00:44:34,0
this, Jesus said

75
00:44:34,0 --> 00:44:34,0
unto them:

76
00:44:34,0 --> 00:44:34,0
Blessed are ye for

77
00:44:34,0 --> 00:44:34,0
this thing which ye

78
00:44:34,0 --> 00:44:34,0
have done, for

79
00:44:34,0 --> 00:44:34,0
this is fulfilling

80
00:44:34,0 --> 00:44:34,0
my commandments,

81
00:44:34,0 --> 00:44:34,0
and this doth

82
00:44:34,0 --> 00:44:34,0
witness unto the

83
00:44:34,0 --> 00:44:34,0
Father that ye are

84
00:44:34,0 --> 00:44:34,0
willing to do that

85
00:44:34,0 --> 00:49:44,
which I have commanded you.

86
00:49:44,0 --> 00:49:44,0
11 And this

87
00:49:44,0 --> 00:49:44,0
shall ye always do

88
00:49:44,0 --> 00:49:44,0
to those who

89
00:49:44,0 --> 00:49:44,0
repent and are

90
00:49:44,0 --> 00:49:44,0
baptized in my name;

91
00:49:44,0 --> 00:49:44,0
and ye shall do

92
00:49:44,0 --> 00:49:44,0
it in

93
00:49:44,0 --> 00:49:44,0
remembrance of my blood,

94
00:49:44,0 --> 00:49:44,0
which I have shed

95
00:49:44,0 --> 00:49:44,0
for you, that

96
00:49:44,0 --> 00:49:44,0
ye may witness

97
00:49:44,0 --> 00:49:44,0
unto the Father

98
00:49:44,0 --> 00:49:44,0
that ye do always

99
00:49:44,0 --> 00:49:44,0
remember me. And

100
00:49:44,0 --> 00:49:44,0
if ye do always

101
00:49:44,0 --> 00:49:44,0
remember me ye

102
00:49:44,0 --> 00:49:44,0
shall have my

103
00:49:44,0 --> 00:53:57,
Spirit to be with you.

104
00:53:57,0 --> 00:53:57,0
12 And I give

105
00:53:57,0 --> 00:53:57,0
unto you a

106
00:53:57,0 --> 00:53:57,0
commandment that ye

107
00:53:57,0 --> 00:53:57,0
shall do these

108
00:53:57,0 --> 00:53:57,0
things. And if

109
00:53:57,0 --> 00:53:57,0
ye shall always

110
00:53:57,0 --> 00:53:57,0
do these

111
00:53:57,0 --> 00:53:57,0
things blessed are

112
00:53:57,0 --> 00:53:57,0
ye, for ye are

113
00:53:57,0 --> 01:05:25,
built upon my rock.

114
01:05:25,0 --> 01:05:25,0
13 But whoso

115
01:05:25,0 --> 01:05:25,0
among you shall

116
01:05:25,0 --> 01:05:25,0
do more or

117
01:05:25,0 --> 01:05:25,0
less than these

118
01:05:25,0 --> 01:05:25,0
are not built

119
01:05:25,0 --> 01:05:25,0
upon my rock,

120
01:05:25,0 --> 01:05:25,0
but are built

121
01:05:25,0 --> 01:05:25,0
upon a sandy

122
01:05:25,0 --> 01:05:25,0
foundation; and

123
01:05:25,0 --> 01:05:25,0
when the rain

124
01:05:25,0 --> 01:05:25,0
descends, and

125
01:05:25,0 --> 01:05:25,0
the floods

126
01:05:25,0 --> 01:05:25,0
come, and the

127
01:05:25,0 --> 01:05:25,0
winds blow, and

128
01:05:25,0 --> 01:05:25,0
beat upon

129
01:05:25,0 --> 01:05:25,0
them, they shall

130
01:05:25,0 --> 01:05:25,0
fall, and the

131
01:05:25,0 --> 01:05:25,0
gates of hell

132
01:05:25,0 --> 01:08:56,
are ready open to receive them.

133
01:08:56,0 --> 01:08:56,0
14 Therefore

134
01:08:56,0 --> 01:08:56,0
blessed are

135
01:08:56,0 --> 01:08:56,0
ye if ye shall

136
01:08:56,0 --> 01:08:56,0
keep my

137
01:08:56,0 --> 01:08:56,0
commandments,

138
01:08:56,0 --> 01:08:56,0
which the Father

139
01:08:56,0 --> 01:08:56,0
hath

140
01:08:56,0 --> 01:08:56,0
commanded me that I

141
01:08:56,0 --> 01:10:08,
should give unto you.

142
01:10:08,0 --> 01:10:08,0
15 Verily,

143
01:10:08,0 --> 01:10:08,0
verily, I say

144
01:10:08,0 --> 01:10:08,0
unto you,

145
01:10:08,0 --> 01:10:08,0
ye must watch

146
01:10:08,0 --> 01:10:08,0
and pray

147
01:10:08,0 --> 01:10:08,0
always, lest

148
01:10:08,0 --> 01:10:08,0
ye be tempted

149
01:10:08,0 --> 01:10:08,0
by the

150
01:10:08,0 --> 01:10:08,0
devil, and ye be

151
01:10:08,0 --> 01:10:08,0
led away

152
01:10:08,0 --> 01:14:51,
captive by him.

153
01:14:51,0 --> 01:14:51,0
16 And as I

154
01:14:51,0 --> 01:14:51,0
have

155
01:14:51,0 --> 01:14:51,0
prayed among you

156
01:14:51,0 --> 01:14:51,0
even so

157
01:14:51,0 --> 01:14:51,0
shall ye pray

158
01:14:51,0 --> 01:14:51,0
in my

159
01:14:51,0 --> 01:14:51,0
church, among

160
01:14:51,0 --> 01:14:51,0
my people

161
01:14:51,0 --> 01:14:51,0
who do repent

162
01:14:51,0 --> 01:14:51,0
and are

163
01:14:51,0 --> 01:14:51,0
baptized in

164
01:14:51,0 --> 01:14:51,0
my name.

165
01:14:51,0 --> 01:14:51,0
Behold I am

166
01:14:51,0 --> 01:14:51,0
the light; I

167
01:14:51,0 --> 01:14:51,0
have set an

168
01:14:51,0 --> 01:17:03,
example for you.

169
01:17:03,0 --> 01:17:03,0
17 And it

170
01:17:03,0 --> 01:17:03,0
came to

171
01:17:03,0 --> 01:17:03,0
pass that

172
01:17:03,0 --> 01:17:03,0
when Jesus

173
01:17:03,0 --> 01:17:03,0
had spoken

174
01:17:03,0 --> 01:17:03,0
these

175
01:17:03,0 --> 01:17:03,0
words unto his

176
01:17:03,0 --> 01:17:03,0


177
01:17:03,0 --> 01:17:03,0
disciples, he

178
01:17:03,0 --> 01:17:03,0
turned again

179
01:17:03,0 --> 01:17:03,0
unto the

180
01:17:03,0 --> 01:17:03,0
multitude and

181
01:17:03,0 --> 01:28:10,
said unto them:

182
01:28:10,0 --> 01:28:10,0
18

183
01:28:10,0 --> 01:28:10,0
Behold, verily,

184
01:28:10,0 --> 01:28:10,0
verily,

185
01:28:10,0 --> 01:28:10,0
I say

186
01:28:10,0 --> 01:28:10,0
unto you, ye

187
01:28:10,0 --> 01:28:10,0
must

188
01:28:10,0 --> 01:28:10,0
watch and

189
01:28:10,0 --> 01:28:10,0
pray always

190
01:28:10,0 --> 01:28:10,0
lest ye

191
01:28:10,0 --> 01:28:10,0
enter

192
01:28:10,0 --> 01:28:10,0
into

193
01:28:10,0 --> 01:28:10,0
temptation; for

194
01:28:10,0 --> 01:28:10,0
Satan

195
01:28:10,0 --> 01:28:10,0
desireth to

196
01:28:10,0 --> 01:28:10,0
have you,

197
01:28:10,0 --> 01:28:10,0
that he

198
01:28:10,0 --> 01:31:41,
may sift you as wheat.

199
01:31:41,0 --> 01:31:41,0
19

200
01:31:41,0 --> 01:31:41,0
Therefore ye

201
01:31:41,0 --> 01:31:41,0
must

202
01:31:41,0 --> 01:31:41,0
always pray

203
01:31:41,0 --> 01:31:41,0
unto

204
01:31:41,0 --> 01:31:41,0
the Father

205
01:31:41,0 --> 01:38:49,
in my name;

206
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
20 And

207
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0


208
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
whatsoever ye

209
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
shall

210
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
ask the

211
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
Father

212
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
in my

213
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
name,

214
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
which is

215
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
right,

216
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0


217
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
believing that

218
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
ye

219
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
shall

220
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
receive,

221
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
behold it

222
01:38:49,0 --> 01:38:49,0
shall

223
01:38:49,0 --> 01:48:16,
be given unto you.

224
01:48:16,0 --> 01:48:16,0
21

225
01:48:16,0 --> 01:48:16,0
Pray in

226
