00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 8 Tempests, earthquakes, fires,

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
whirlwinds, and physical upheavals attest the

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
crucifixion of Christ—Many people are

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
destroyed—Darkness covers the land for three days—Those

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:18:52,
who remain bemoan their fate. About A.D. 33–34. 

6
00:18:52,0 --> 00:18:52,0
1 And now it came to pass that

7
00:18:52,0 --> 00:18:52,0
according to our record, and we know our record

8
00:18:52,0 --> 00:18:52,0
to be true, for behold, it was a just

9
00:18:52,0 --> 00:18:52,0
man who did keep the record—for he

10
00:18:52,0 --> 00:18:52,0
truly did many miracles in the name of

11
00:18:52,0 --> 00:18:52,0
Jesus; and there was not any man who could

12
00:18:52,0 --> 00:18:52,0
do a miracle in the name of Jesus save

13
00:18:52,0 --> 00:20:04,
he were cleansed every whit from his iniquity—

14
00:20:04,0 --> 00:20:04,0
2 And now it came to pass, if there

15
00:20:04,0 --> 00:20:04,0
was no mistake made by this man in

16
00:20:04,0 --> 00:20:04,0
the reckoning of our time, the

17
00:20:04,0 --> 00:21:16,
thirty and third year had passed away;

18
00:21:16,0 --> 00:21:16,0
3 And the people began to look

19
00:21:16,0 --> 00:21:16,0
with great earnestness for the

20
00:21:16,0 --> 00:21:16,0
sign which had been given by the

21
00:21:16,0 --> 00:21:16,0
prophet Samuel, the Lamanite,

22
00:21:16,0 --> 00:21:16,0
yea, for the time that there should

23
00:21:16,0 --> 00:21:16,0
be darkness for the space of

24
00:21:16,0 --> 00:22:28,
three days over the face of the land.

25
00:22:28,0 --> 00:22:28,0
4 And there began to be great

26
00:22:28,0 --> 00:22:28,0
doubtings and disputations

27
00:22:28,0 --> 00:22:28,0
among the people, notwithstanding

28
00:22:28,0 --> 00:24:40,
so many signs had been given.

29
00:24:40,0 --> 00:24:40,0
5 And it came to pass in

30
00:24:40,0 --> 00:24:40,0
the thirty and fourth year,

31
00:24:40,0 --> 00:24:40,0
in the first month, on

32
00:24:40,0 --> 00:24:40,0
the fourth day of the month,

33
00:24:40,0 --> 00:24:40,0
there arose a great

34
00:24:40,0 --> 00:24:40,0
storm, such an one as never had

35
00:24:40,0 --> 00:24:12,
been known in all the land.

36
00:24:12,0 --> 00:24:12,0
6 And there was also a

37
00:24:12,0 --> 00:24:12,0
great and terrible

38
00:24:12,0 --> 00:24:12,0
tempest; and there was

39
00:24:12,0 --> 00:24:12,0
terrible thunder, insomuch

40
00:24:12,0 --> 00:24:12,0
that it did shake the

41
00:24:12,0 --> 00:24:12,0
whole earth as if it was

42
00:24:12,0 --> 00:23:58,
about to divide asunder.

43
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
7 And there were

44
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
exceedingly sharp lightnings,

45
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
such as never had been

46
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:44,
known in all the land.

47
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
8 And the city of

48
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:58,
Zarahemla did take fire.

49
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
9 And the city of

50
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
Moroni did sink into

51
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
the depths of the

52
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
sea, and the

53
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:44,
inhabitants thereof were drowned.

54
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
10 And the earth was

55
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
carried up upon the

56
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
city of Moronihah,

57
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
that in the place of

58
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
the city there

59
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:58,
became a great mountain.

60
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
11 And there was a

61
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
great and

62
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
terrible destruction in

63
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:44,
the land southward.

64
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
12 But behold,

65
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
there was a more

66
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
great and terrible

67
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
destruction in

68
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
the land northward;

69
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
for behold, the

70
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
whole face of the

71
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
land was

72
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
changed, because of the

73
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
tempest and the

74
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
whirlwinds, and

75
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
the thunderings and

76
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
the lightnings,

77
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
and the

78
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
exceedingly great quaking

79
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:58,
of the whole earth;

80
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
13 And the

81
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
highways were

82
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
broken up, and the

83
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
level roads were

84
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
spoiled, and

85
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
many smooth

86
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:44,
places became rough.

87
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
14 And many

88
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
great and

89
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
notable cities were

90
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
sunk, and many

91
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
were burned,

92
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
and many were

93
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
shaken till

94
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
the buildings

95
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
thereof had

96
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
fallen to the

97
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
earth, and the

98
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
inhabitants

99
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
thereof were slain,

100
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
and the

101
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:58,
places were left desolate.

102
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
15 And there

103
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
were some

104
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
cities which

105
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
remained; but

106
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
the damage

107
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
thereof was

108
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
exceedingly great,

109
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
and there

110
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
were many in

111
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:44,
them who were slain.

112
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
16 And there

113
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
were some

114
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
who were

115
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
carried away in

116
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
the

117
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
whirlwind; and

118
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
whither they went

119
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
no man

120
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
knoweth, save

121
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
they know that

122
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
they were

123
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:58,
carried away.

124
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
17 And thus

125
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
the face

126
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
of the whole

127
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
earth

128
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
became

129
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
deformed, because

130
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
of the

131
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
tempests, and

132
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
the

133
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
thunderings, and the

134
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0


135
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
lightnings, and the

136
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:44,
quaking of the earth.

137
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
18 And

138
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
behold, the

139
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
rocks were

140
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
rent in

141
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
twain; they

142
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
were

143
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
broken up upon

144
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
the face

145
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
of the

146
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
whole earth,

147
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
insomuch

148
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
that they

149
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
were found

150
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
in broken

151
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
fragments,

152
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
and in

153
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
seams and in

154
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
cracks,

155
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:58,
upon all the face of the land.

156
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
19 And it

157
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
came to

158
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
pass that

159
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
when the

160
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0


161
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
thunderings, and

162
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
the

163
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
lightnings,

164
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
and the

165
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
storm, and

166
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
the

167
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
tempest, and

168
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
the

169
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
quakings of the

170
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
earth did

171
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0


172
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
cease—for behold,

173
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
they did

174
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
last for

175
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
about

176
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
the space

177
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
of three

178
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
hours; and

179
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
it was

180
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
said by

181
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
some that

182
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
the time

183
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
was

184
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
greater;

185
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
nevertheless,

186
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
all these

187
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
great and

188
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
terrible

189
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
things

190
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
were done

191
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
in about

192
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
the space

193
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
of three

194
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0


195
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
hours—and then

196
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
behold,

197
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:44,
there was darkness upon the face of the land.

198
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
20 And

199
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
it came

200
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
to pass

201
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
that

202
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
there was

203
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
thick

204
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
darkness

205
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
upon all

206
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
the face

207
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
of the

208
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
land,

209
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
insomuch

210
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
that the

211
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0


212
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
inhabitants

213
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
thereof who

214
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
had not

215
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
fallen

216
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
could feel

217
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:58,
the vapor of darkness;

218
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
21 And

219
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
there

220
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
could be

221
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
no

222
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
light,

223
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
because of

224
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
the

225
00:23:58,0 --> 00:23:58,0
darkness,

226
