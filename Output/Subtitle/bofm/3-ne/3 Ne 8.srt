00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:06,0
Chapter 8 Tempests, earthquakes, fires,

2
00:00:06,0 --> 00:00:12,0
whirlwinds, and physical upheavals attest the

3
00:00:12,0 --> 00:00:18,0
crucifixion of Christ—Many people are

4
00:00:18,0 --> 00:00:24,0
destroyed—Darkness covers the land for three days—Those

5
00:00:24,0 --> 00:00:30,23
who remain bemoan their fate. About A.D. 33–34. 

6
00:00:30,23 --> 00:00:31,48
1 And now it came to pass that

7
00:00:31,48 --> 00:00:32,73
according to our record, and we know our record

8
00:00:32,73 --> 00:00:33,98
to be true, for behold, it was a just

9
00:00:33,98 --> 00:00:35,23
man who did keep the record—for he

10
00:00:35,23 --> 00:00:36,48
truly did many miracles in the name of

11
00:00:36,48 --> 00:00:37,73
Jesus; and there was not any man who could

12
00:00:37,73 --> 00:00:38,98
do a miracle in the name of Jesus save

13
00:00:38,98 --> 00:00:40,607
he were cleansed every whit from his iniquity—

14
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:40,357
2 And now it came to pass, if there

15
00:00:40,357 --> 00:00:40,107
was no mistake made by this man in

16
00:00:40,107 --> 00:00:39,857
the reckoning of our time, the

17
00:00:39,857 --> 00:00:39,673
thirty and third year had passed away;

18
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:39,53
3 And the people began to look

19
00:00:39,53 --> 00:00:39,387
with great earnestness for the

20
00:00:39,387 --> 00:00:39,244
sign which had been given by the

21
00:00:39,244 --> 00:00:39,101
prophet Samuel, the Lamanite,

22
00:00:39,101 --> 00:00:38,958
yea, for the time that there should

23
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:38,815
be darkness for the space of

24
00:00:38,815 --> 00:00:38,739
three days over the face of the land.

25
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:39,989
4 And there began to be great

26
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:41,239
doubtings and disputations

27
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:42,489
among the people, notwithstanding

28
00:00:42,489 --> 00:00:43,143
so many signs had been given.

29
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:43,0
5 And it came to pass in

30
00:00:43,0 --> 00:00:42,857
the thirty and fourth year,

31
00:00:42,857 --> 00:00:42,714
in the first month, on

32
00:00:42,714 --> 00:00:42,571
the fourth day of the month,

33
00:00:42,571 --> 00:00:42,428
there arose a great

34
00:00:42,428 --> 00:00:42,285
storm, such an one as never had

35
00:00:42,285 --> 00:00:42,209
been known in all the land.

36
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:42,066
6 And there was also a

37
00:00:42,066 --> 00:00:41,923
great and terrible

38
00:00:41,923 --> 00:00:41,78
tempest; and there was

39
00:00:41,78 --> 00:00:41,637
terrible thunder, insomuch

40
00:00:41,637 --> 00:00:41,494
that it did shake the

41
00:00:41,494 --> 00:00:41,351
whole earth as if it was

42
00:00:41,351 --> 00:00:41,275
about to divide asunder.

43
00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:42,275
7 And there were

44
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:43,275
exceedingly sharp lightnings,

45
00:00:43,275 --> 00:00:44,275
such as never had been

46
00:00:44,275 --> 00:00:45,679
known in all the land.

47
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:52,679
8 And the city of

48
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:59,96
Zarahemla did take fire.

49
00:00:59,96 --> 00:01:06,36
9 And the city of

50
00:01:06,36 --> 00:01:12,76
Moroni did sink into

51
00:01:12,76 --> 00:01:19,16
the depths of the

52
00:01:19,16 --> 00:01:25,56
sea, and the

53
00:01:25,56 --> 00:01:31,391
inhabitants thereof were drowned.

54
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:34,058
10 And the earth was

55
00:01:34,058 --> 00:01:36,725
carried up upon the

56
00:01:36,725 --> 00:01:39,392
city of Moronihah,

57
00:01:39,392 --> 00:01:42,059
that in the place of

58
00:01:42,059 --> 00:01:44,726
the city there

59
00:01:44,726 --> 00:01:47,341
became a great mountain.

60
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:54,341
11 And there was a

61
00:01:54,341 --> 00:02:01,341
great and

62
00:02:01,341 --> 00:02:08,341
terrible destruction in

63
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:15,636
the land southward.

64
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:16,261
12 But behold,

65
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:16,886
there was a more

66
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:17,511
great and terrible

67
00:02:17,511 --> 00:02:18,136
destruction in

68
00:02:18,136 --> 00:02:18,761
the land northward;

69
00:02:18,761 --> 00:02:19,386
for behold, the

70
00:02:19,386 --> 00:02:20,011
whole face of the

71
00:02:20,011 --> 00:02:20,636
land was

72
00:02:20,636 --> 00:02:21,261
changed, because of the

73
00:02:21,261 --> 00:02:21,886
tempest and the

74
00:02:21,886 --> 00:02:22,511
whirlwinds, and

75
00:02:22,511 --> 00:02:23,136
the thunderings and

76
00:02:23,136 --> 00:02:23,761
the lightnings,

77
00:02:23,761 --> 00:02:24,386
and the

78
00:02:24,386 --> 00:02:25,011
exceedingly great quaking

79
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:25,979
of the whole earth;

80
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,122
13 And the

81
00:02:28,122 --> 00:02:30,265
highways were

82
00:02:30,265 --> 00:02:32,408
broken up, and the

83
00:02:32,408 --> 00:02:34,551
level roads were

84
00:02:34,551 --> 00:02:36,694
spoiled, and

85
00:02:36,694 --> 00:02:38,837
many smooth

86
00:02:38,837 --> 00:02:40,26
places became rough.

87
00:02:40,26 --> 00:02:40,727
14 And many

88
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:41,194
great and

89
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:41,661
notable cities were

90
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:42,128
sunk, and many

91
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:42,595
were burned,

92
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:43,062
and many were

93
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:43,529
shaken till

94
00:02:43,529 --> 00:02:43,996
the buildings

95
00:02:43,996 --> 00:02:44,463
thereof had

96
00:02:44,463 --> 00:02:44,93
fallen to the

97
00:02:44,93 --> 00:02:45,397
earth, and the

98
00:02:45,397 --> 00:02:45,864
inhabitants

99
00:02:45,864 --> 00:02:46,331
thereof were slain,

100
00:02:46,331 --> 00:02:46,798
and the

101
00:02:46,798 --> 00:02:47,3
places were left desolate.

102
00:02:47,3 --> 00:02:49,6
15 And there

103
00:02:49,6 --> 00:02:51,9
were some

104
00:02:51,9 --> 00:02:54,2
cities which

105
00:02:54,2 --> 00:02:56,5
remained; but

106
00:02:56,5 --> 00:02:58,8
the damage

107
00:02:58,8 --> 00:03:01,1
thereof was

108
00:03:01,1 --> 00:03:03,4
exceedingly great,

109
00:03:03,4 --> 00:03:05,7
and there

110
00:03:05,7 --> 00:03:08,0
were many in

111
00:03:08,0 --> 00:03:10,757
them who were slain.

112
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:11,924
16 And there

113
00:03:11,924 --> 00:03:13,091
were some

114
00:03:13,091 --> 00:03:14,258
who were

115
00:03:14,258 --> 00:03:15,425
carried away in

116
00:03:15,425 --> 00:03:16,592
the

117
00:03:16,592 --> 00:03:17,759
whirlwind; and

118
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:18,926
whither they went

119
00:03:18,926 --> 00:03:20,093
no man

120
00:03:20,093 --> 00:03:21,26
knoweth, save

121
00:03:21,26 --> 00:03:22,427
they know that

122
00:03:22,427 --> 00:03:23,594
they were

123
00:03:23,594 --> 00:03:24,137
carried away.

124
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:25,214
17 And thus

125
00:03:25,214 --> 00:03:26,291
the face

126
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,368
of the whole

127
00:03:27,368 --> 00:03:28,445
earth

128
00:03:28,445 --> 00:03:29,522
became

129
00:03:29,522 --> 00:03:30,599
deformed, because

130
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:31,676
of the

131
00:03:31,676 --> 00:03:32,753
tempests, and

132
00:03:32,753 --> 00:03:33,83
the

133
00:03:33,83 --> 00:03:34,907
thunderings, and the

134
00:03:34,907 --> 00:03:35,984


135
00:03:35,984 --> 00:03:37,061
lightnings, and the

136
00:03:37,061 --> 00:03:38,418
quaking of the earth.

137
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:38,523
18 And

138
00:03:38,523 --> 00:03:38,628
behold, the

139
00:03:38,628 --> 00:03:38,733
rocks were

140
00:03:38,733 --> 00:03:38,838
rent in

141
00:03:38,838 --> 00:03:38,943
twain; they

142
00:03:38,943 --> 00:03:39,048
were

143
00:03:39,048 --> 00:03:39,153
broken up upon

144
00:03:39,153 --> 00:03:39,258
the face

145
00:03:39,258 --> 00:03:39,363
of the

146
00:03:39,363 --> 00:03:39,468
whole earth,

147
00:03:39,468 --> 00:03:39,573
insomuch

148
00:03:39,573 --> 00:03:39,678
that they

149
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:39,783
were found

150
00:03:39,783 --> 00:03:39,888
in broken

151
00:03:39,888 --> 00:03:39,993
fragments,

152
00:03:39,993 --> 00:03:40,098
and in

153
00:03:40,098 --> 00:03:40,203
seams and in

154
00:03:40,203 --> 00:03:40,308
cracks,

155
00:03:40,308 --> 00:03:40,821
upon all the face of the land.

156
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:41,25
19 And it

157
00:03:41,25 --> 00:03:41,679
came to

158
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:42,108
pass that

159
00:03:42,108 --> 00:03:42,537
when the

160
00:03:42,537 --> 00:03:42,966


161
00:03:42,966 --> 00:03:43,395
thunderings, and

162
00:03:43,395 --> 00:03:43,824
the

163
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:44,253
lightnings,

164
00:03:44,253 --> 00:03:44,682
and the

165
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:45,111
storm, and

166
00:03:45,111 --> 00:03:45,54
the

167
00:03:45,54 --> 00:03:45,969
tempest, and

168
00:03:45,969 --> 00:03:46,398
the

169
00:03:46,398 --> 00:03:46,827
quakings of the

170
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:47,256
earth did

171
00:03:47,256 --> 00:03:47,685


172
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:48,114
cease—for behold,

173
00:03:48,114 --> 00:03:48,543
they did

174
00:03:48,543 --> 00:03:48,972
last for

175
00:03:48,972 --> 00:03:49,401
about

176
00:03:49,401 --> 00:03:49,83
the space

177
00:03:49,83 --> 00:03:50,259
of three

178
00:03:50,259 --> 00:03:50,688
hours; and

179
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:51,117
it was

180
00:03:51,117 --> 00:03:51,546
said by

181
00:03:51,546 --> 00:03:51,975
some that

182
00:03:51,975 --> 00:03:52,404
the time

183
00:03:52,404 --> 00:03:52,833
was

184
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:53,262
greater;

185
00:03:53,262 --> 00:03:53,691
nevertheless,

186
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:54,12
all these

187
00:03:54,12 --> 00:03:54,549
great and

188
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:54,978
terrible

189
00:03:54,978 --> 00:03:55,407
things

190
00:03:55,407 --> 00:03:55,836
were done

191
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:56,265
in about

192
00:03:56,265 --> 00:03:56,694
the space

193
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:57,123
of three

194
00:03:57,123 --> 00:03:57,552


195
00:03:57,552 --> 00:03:57,981
hours—and then

196
00:03:57,981 --> 00:03:58,41
behold,

197
00:03:58,41 --> 00:03:58,238
there was darkness upon the face of the land.

198
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:58,588
20 And

199
00:03:58,588 --> 00:03:58,938
it came

200
00:03:58,938 --> 00:03:59,288
to pass

201
00:03:59,288 --> 00:03:59,638
that

202
00:03:59,638 --> 00:03:59,988
there was

203
00:03:59,988 --> 00:04:00,338
thick

204
00:04:00,338 --> 00:04:00,688
darkness

205
00:04:00,688 --> 00:04:01,038
