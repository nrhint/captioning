Chapter 8 Tempests, earthquakes, fires,

2
00:00:09,0 --> 00:00:18,0
 whirlwinds, and physical upheavals attest the crucifixion of

3
00:00:18,0 --> 00:00:27,0
 Christ—Many people are destroyed—Darkness covers

4
00:00:27,0 --> 00:00:36,0
 the land for three days—Those who remain bemoan

5
00:00:36,0 --> 00:00:45,0
 their fate. About A.D. 33–34.

6
00:00:45,946 --> 00:00:47,089
1 And now it came to pass that according to our

7
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:48,232
 record, and we know our record to be true, for

8
00:00:48,232 --> 00:00:49,375
 behold, it was a just man who did keep the record—for

9
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:50,518
 he truly did many miracles in the name of Jesus;

10
00:00:50,518 --> 00:00:51,661
 and there was not any man who could do a miracle in

11
00:00:51,661 --> 00:00:52,804
 the name of Jesus save he were cleansed every whit

12
00:00:52,804 --> 00:00:53,947
 from his iniquity

13
00:00:53,921 --> 00:01:11,921
2 And now it came to pass, if there was no mistake

14
00:01:11,921 --> 00:01:29,921
 made by this man in the reckoning of our time,

15
00:01:29,921 --> 00:01:47,921
 the thirty and third year had passed away

16
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:52,107
3 And the people began to look with great

17
00:01:52,107 --> 00:01:56,907
 earnestness for the sign which had been given by the

18
00:01:56,907 --> 00:02:01,707
 prophet Samuel, the Lamanite, yea, for the time that

19
00:02:01,707 --> 00:02:06,507
 there should be darkness for the space of three days

20
00:02:06,507 --> 00:02:11,307
 over the face of the land

21
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:16,832
4 And there began to be great doubtings and

22
00:02:16,832 --> 00:02:21,832
 disputations among the people, notwithstanding so many

23
00:02:21,832 --> 00:02:26,832
 signs had been given

24
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:32,597
5 And it came to pass in the thirty and fourth

25
00:02:32,597 --> 00:02:38,347
 year, in the first month, on the fourth day of the

26
00:02:38,347 --> 00:02:44,097
 month, there arose a great storm, such an one as

27
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:49,847
 never had been known in all the land

28
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:54,836
6 And there was also a great and terrible tempest;

29
00:02:54,836 --> 00:03:00,336
 and there was terrible thunder, insomuch that it

30
00:03:00,336 --> 00:03:05,836
 did shake the whole earth as if it was about to

31
00:03:05,836 --> 00:03:11,336
 divide asunder

32
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:18,825
7 And there were exceedingly sharp lightnings,

33
00:03:18,825 --> 00:03:25,825
 such as never had been known in all the land

34
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:49,806
8 And the city of Zarahemla did take fire

35
00:03:49,73 --> 00:03:50,062
9 And the city of Moroni did sink into the depths

36
00:03:50,062 --> 00:03:50,395
 of the sea, and the inhabitants thereof were

37
00:03:50,395 --> 00:03:50,728
 drowned

38
00:03:50,13 --> 00:03:52,797
10 And the earth was carried up upon the city of

39
00:03:52,797 --> 00:03:55,464
 Moronihah, that in the place of the city there

40
00:03:55,464 --> 00:03:58,131
 became a great mountain

41
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:03,705
11 And there was a great and terrible destruction

42
00:04:03,705 --> 00:04:08,705
 in the land southward

43
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:15,115
12 But behold, there was a more great and terrible

44
00:04:15,115 --> 00:04:21,448
 destruction in the land northward; for behold,

45
00:04:21,448 --> 00:04:27,781
 the whole face of the land was changed, because of

46
00:04:27,781 --> 00:04:34,114
 the tempest and the whirlwinds, and the thunderings

47
00:04:34,114 --> 00:04:40,447
 and the lightnings, and the exceedingly great

48
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:46,78
 quaking of the whole earth

49
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:54,219
13 And the highways were broken up, and the level

50
00:04:54,219 --> 00:05:02,219
 roads were spoiled, and many smooth places became

51
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:10,219
 rough

52
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:18,043
14 And many great and notable cities were sunk,

53
00:05:18,043 --> 00:05:26,043
 and many were burned, and many were shaken till the

54
00:05:26,043 --> 00:05:34,043
 buildings thereof had fallen to the earth, and the

55
00:05:34,043 --> 00:05:42,043
 inhabitants thereof were slain, and the places

56
00:05:42,043 --> 00:05:50,043
 were left desolate

57
00:05:50,55 --> 00:05:55,55
15 And there were some cities which remained; but

58
00:05:55,55 --> 00:06:00,55
 the damage thereof was exceedingly great, and

59
00:06:00,55 --> 00:06:05,55
 there were many in them who were slain

60
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:10,464
16 And there were some who were carried away in

61
00:06:10,464 --> 00:06:15,797
 the whirlwind; and whither they went no man knoweth,

62
00:06:15,797 --> 00:06:21,13
 save they know that they were carried away

63
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:27,698
17 And thus the face of the whole earth became

64
00:06:27,698 --> 00:06:33,448
 deformed, because of the tempests, and the

65
00:06:33,448 --> 00:06:39,198
 thunderings, and the lightnings, and the quaking of the

66
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:44,948
 earth

67
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:50,237
18 And behold, the rocks were rent in twain; they

68
00:06:50,237 --> 00:06:56,037
 were broken up upon the face of the whole earth,

69
00:06:56,037 --> 00:07:01,837
 insomuch that they were found in broken fragments,

70
00:07:01,837 --> 00:07:07,637
 and in seams and in cracks, upon all the face of

71
00:07:07,637 --> 00:07:13,437
 the land

72
00:07:13,4 --> 00:07:19,067
19 And it came to pass that when the thunderings,

73
00:07:19,067 --> 00:07:24,734
 and the lightnings, and the storm, and the

74
00:07:24,734 --> 00:07:30,401
 tempest, and the quakings of the earth did cease—for

75
00:07:30,401 --> 00:07:36,068
 behold, they did last for about the space of three

76
00:07:36,068 --> 00:07:41,735
 hours; and it was said by some that the time was

77
00:07:41,735 --> 00:07:47,402
 greater; nevertheless, all these great and terrible

78
00:07:47,402 --> 00:07:53,069
 things were done in about the space of three

79
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:58,736
 hours—and then behold, there was darkness upon the face

80
00:07:58,736 --> 00:08:04,403
 of the land

81
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:09,701
20 And it came to pass that there was thick

82
00:08:09,701 --> 00:08:14,451
 darkness upon all the face of the land, insomuch that

83
00:08:14,451 --> 00:08:19,201
 the inhabitants thereof who had not fallen could

84
00:08:19,201 --> 00:08:23,951
 feel the vapor of darkness

85
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:29,903
21 And there could be no light, because of the

86
00:08:29,903 --> 00:08:36,103
 darkness, neither candles, neither torches; neither

87
00:08:36,103 --> 00:08:42,303
 could there be fire kindled with their fine and

88
00:08:42,303 --> 00:08:48,503
 exceedingly dry wood, so that there could not be any

89
00:08:48,503 --> 00:08:54,703
 light at all

90
00:08:54,167 --> 00:09:01,417
22 And there was not any light seen, neither fire,

91
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:08,667
 nor glimmer, neither the sun, nor the moon, nor

92
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:15,917
 the stars, for so great were the mists of darkness

93
00:09:15,917 --> 00:09:23,167
 which were upon the face of the land

94
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:28,892
23 And it came to pass that it did last for the

95
00:09:28,892 --> 00:09:34,321
 space of three days that there was no light seen;

96
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:39,75
 and there was great mourning and howling and weeping

97
00:09:39,75 --> 00:09:45,179
 among all the people continually; yea, great were

98
00:09:45,179 --> 00:09:50,608
 the groanings of the people, because of the

99
00:09:50,608 --> 00:09:56,037
 darkness and the great destruction which had come upon

100
00:09:56,037 --> 00:10:01,466
 them

101
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:07,734
24 And in one place they were heard to cry,

102
00:10:07,734 --> 00:10:14,334
 saying: O that we had repented before this great and

103
00:10:14,334 --> 00:10:20,934
 terrible day, and then would our brethren have been

104
00:10:20,934 --> 00:10:27,534
 spared, and they would not have been burned in that

105
00:10:27,534 --> 00:10:34,134
 great city Zarahemla

106
00:10:34,0 --> 00:10:34,75
25 And in another place they were heard to cry and

107
00:10:34,75 --> 00:10:35,5
 mourn, saying: O that we had repented before this

108
00:10:35,5 --> 00:10:36,25
 great and terrible day, and had not killed and

109
00:10:36,25 --> 00:10:37,0
 stoned the prophets, and cast them out; then would

110
00:10:37,0 --> 00:10:37,75
 our mothers and our fair daughters, and our

111
00:10:37,75 --> 00:10:38,5
 children have been spared, and not have been buried up in

112
00:10:38,5 --> 00:10:39,25
 that great city Moronihah. And thus were the

113
00:10:39,25 --> 00:10:40,0
 howlings of the people great and terrible.
