1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:06,714
Chapter 7 The chief judge is murdered, the

2
00:00:06,714 --> 00:00:13,428
 government is destroyed, and the people divide into

3
00:00:13,428 --> 00:00:20,142
 tribes—Jacob, an anti-Christ, becomes king of a secret

4
00:00:20,142 --> 00:00:26,856
 combination—Nephi preaches repentance and faith in

5
00:00:26,856 --> 00:00:33,57
 Christ—Angels minister to him daily, and he

6
00:00:33,57 --> 00:00:40,284
 raises his brother from the dead—Many repent and are

7
00:00:40,284 --> 00:00:46,998
 baptized. About A.D. 30–33.

8
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:54,248
1 Now behold, I will show unto you that they did

9
00:00:54,248 --> 00:01:00,648
 not establish a king over the land; but in this

10
00:01:00,648 --> 00:01:07,048
 same year, yea, the thirtieth year, they did destroy

11
00:01:07,048 --> 00:01:13,448
 upon the judgment-seat, yea, did murder the chief

12
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:19,848
 judge of the land

13
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:29,546
2 And the people were divided one against another;

14
00:01:29,546 --> 00:01:39,346
 and they did separate one from another into

15
00:01:39,346 --> 00:01:49,146
 tribes, every man according to his family and his

16
00:01:49,146 --> 00:01:58,946
 kindred and friends; and thus they did destroy the

17
00:01:58,946 --> 00:02:08,746
 government of the land

18
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,295
3 And every tribe did appoint a chief or a leader

19
00:02:10,295 --> 00:02:11,628
 over them; and thus they became tribes and leaders

20
00:02:11,628 --> 00:02:12,961
 of tribes

21
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:15,199
4 Now behold, there was no man among them save he

22
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:17,866
 had much family and many kindreds and friends;

23
00:02:17,866 --> 00:02:20,533
 therefore their tribes became exceedingly great

24
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:30,007
5 Now all this was done, and there were no wars as

25
00:02:30,007 --> 00:02:39,507
 yet among them; and all this iniquity had come

26
00:02:39,507 --> 00:02:49,007
 upon the people because they did yield themselves

27
00:02:49,007 --> 00:02:58,507
 unto the power of Satan

28
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:03,012
6 And the regulations of the government were

29
00:03:03,012 --> 00:03:07,512
 destroyed, because of the secret combination of the

30
00:03:07,512 --> 00:03:12,012
 friends and kindreds of those who murdered the

31
00:03:12,012 --> 00:03:16,512
 prophets

32
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:22,079
7 And they did cause a great contention in the

33
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:27,829
 land, insomuch that the more righteous part of the

34
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:33,579
 people had nearly all become wicked; yea, there were

35
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:39,329
 but few righteous men among them

36
00:03:39,553 --> 00:04:01,553
8 And thus six years had not passed away since the

37
00:04:01,553 --> 00:04:23,553
 more part of the people had turned from their

38
00:04:23,553 --> 00:04:45,553
 righteousness, like the dog to his vomit, or like the

39
00:04:45,553 --> 00:05:07,553
 sow to her wallowing in the mire

40
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:09,274
9 Now this secret combination, which had brought

41
00:05:09,274 --> 00:05:11,274
 so great iniquity upon the people, did gather

42
00:05:11,274 --> 00:05:13,274
 themselves together, and did place at their head a man

43
00:05:13,274 --> 00:05:15,274
 whom they did call Jacob

44
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:15,248
10 And they did call him their king; therefore he

45
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:15,248
 became a king over this wicked band; and he was

46
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:15,248
 one of the chiefest who had given his voice against

47
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:15,248
 the prophets who testified of Jesus

48
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,649
11 And it came to pass that they were not so

49
00:05:18,649 --> 00:05:21,649
 strong in number as the tribes of the people, who were

50
00:05:21,649 --> 00:05:24,649
 united together save it were their leaders did

51
00:05:24,649 --> 00:05:27,649
 establish their laws, every one according to his

52
00:05:27,649 --> 00:05:30,649
 tribe; nevertheless they were enemies; notwithstanding

53
00:05:30,649 --> 00:05:33,649
 they were not a righteous people, yet they were

54
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:36,649
 united in the hatred of those who had entered into

55
00:05:36,649 --> 00:05:39,649
 a covenant to destroy the government

56
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:45,473
12 Therefore, Jacob seeing that their enemies were

57
00:05:45,473 --> 00:05:51,373
 more numerous than they, he being the king of the

58
00:05:51,373 --> 00:05:57,273
 band, therefore he commanded his people that they

59
00:05:57,273 --> 00:06:03,173
 should take their flight into the northernmost

60
00:06:03,173 --> 00:06:09,073
 part of the land, and there build up unto themselves

61
00:06:09,073 --> 00:06:14,973
 a kingdom, until they were joined by dissenters,

62
00:06:14,973 --> 00:06:20,873
 (for he flattered them that there would be many

63
00:06:20,873 --> 00:06:26,773
 dissenters) and they become sufficiently strong to

64
00:06:26,773 --> 00:06:32,673
 contend with the tribes of the people; and they did

65
00:06:32,673 --> 00:06:38,573
 so

66
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:43,864
13 And so speedy was their march that it could not

67
00:06:43,864 --> 00:06:49,664
 be impeded until they had gone forth out of the

68
00:06:49,664 --> 00:06:55,464
 reach of the people. And thus ended the thirtieth

69
00:06:55,464 --> 00:07:01,264
 year; and thus were the affairs of the people of

70
00:07:01,264 --> 00:07:07,064
 Nephi

71
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:13,923
14 And it came to pass in the thirty and first

72
00:07:13,923 --> 00:07:19,852
 year that they were divided into tribes, every man

73
00:07:19,852 --> 00:07:25,781
 according to his family, kindred and friends;

74
00:07:25,781 --> 00:07:31,71
 nevertheless they had come to an agreement that they

75
00:07:31,71 --> 00:07:37,639
 would not go to war one with another; but they were

76
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:43,568
 not united as to their laws, and their manner of

77
00:07:43,568 --> 00:07:49,497
 government, for they were established according to

78
00:07:49,497 --> 00:07:55,426
 the minds of those who were their chiefs and their

79
00:07:55,426 --> 00:08:01,355
 leaders. But they did establish very strict laws

80
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:07,284
 that one tribe should not trespass against another,

81
00:08:07,284 --> 00:08:13,213
 insomuch that in some degree they had peace in

82
00:08:13,213 --> 00:08:19,142
 the land; nevertheless, their hearts were turned

83
00:08:19,142 --> 00:08:25,071
 from the Lord their God, and they did stone the

84
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:31,0
 prophets and did cast them out from among them

85
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:36,114
15 And it came to pass that Nephi—having been

86
00:08:36,114 --> 00:08:41,685
 visited by angels and also the voice of the Lord,

87
00:08:41,685 --> 00:08:47,256
 therefore having seen angels, and being eye-witness,

88
00:08:47,256 --> 00:08:52,827
 and having had power given unto him that he might

89
00:08:52,827 --> 00:08:58,398
 know concerning the ministry of Christ, and also

90
00:08:58,398 --> 00:09:03,969
 being eye-witness to their quick return from

91
00:09:03,969 --> 00:09:09,54
 righteousness unto their wickedness and abominations

92
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:15,582
16 Therefore, being grieved for the hardness of

93
00:09:15,582 --> 00:09:21,582
 their hearts and the blindness of their minds—went

94
00:09:21,582 --> 00:09:27,582
 forth among them in that same year, and began to

95
00:09:27,582 --> 00:09:33,582
 testify, boldly, repentance and remission of sins

96
00:09:33,582 --> 00:09:39,582
 through faith on the Lord Jesus Christ

97
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:45,713
17 And he did minister many things unto them; and

98
00:09:45,713 --> 00:09:51,513
 all of them cannot be written, and a part of them

99
00:09:51,513 --> 00:09:57,313
 would not suffice, therefore they are not written

100
00:09:57,313 --> 00:10:03,113
 in this book. And Nephi did minister with power

101
00:10:03,113 --> 00:10:08,913
 and with great authority

102
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:12,874
18 And it came to pass that they were angry with

103
00:10:12,874 --> 00:10:17,207
 him, even because he had greater power than they,

104
00:10:17,207 --> 00:10:21,54
 for it were not possible that they could disbelieve

105
00:10:21,54 --> 00:10:25,873
 his words, for so great was his faith on the Lord

106
00:10:25,873 --> 00:10:30,206
 Jesus Christ that angels did minister unto him

107
00:10:30,206 --> 00:10:34,539
 daily

108
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:41,334
19 And in the name of Jesus did he cast out devils

109
00:10:41,334 --> 00:10:47,834
 and unclean spirits; and even his brother did he

110
00:10:47,834 --> 00:10:54,334
 raise from the dead, after he had been stoned and

111
00:10:54,334 --> 00:11:00,834
 suffered death by the people

112
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:05,793
20 And the people saw it, and did witness of it,

113
00:11:05,793 --> 00:11:10,793
 and were angry with him because of his power; and

114
00:11:10,793 --> 00:11:15,793
 he did also do many more miracles, in the sight of

115
00:11:15,793 --> 00:11:20,793
 the people, in the name of Jesus

116
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:25,946
21 And it came to pass that the thirty and first

117
00:11:25,946 --> 00:11:31,446
 year did pass away, and there were but few who were

118
00:11:31,446 --> 00:11:36,946
 converted unto the Lord; but as many as were

119
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:42,446
 converted did truly signify unto the people that they

120
00:11:42,446 --> 00:11:47,946
 had been visited by the power and Spirit of God,

121
00:11:47,946 --> 00:11:53,446
 which was in Jesus Christ, in whom they believed

122
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:59,614
22 And as many as had devils cast out from them,

123
00:11:59,614 --> 00:12:05,281
 and were healed of their sicknesses and their

124
00:12:05,281 --> 00:12:10,948
 infirmities, did truly manifest unto the people that

125
00:12:10,948 --> 00:12:16,615
 they had been wrought upon by the Spirit of God, and

126
00:12:16,615 --> 00:12:22,282
 had been healed; and they did show forth signs

127
00:12:22,282 --> 00:12:27,949
 also and did do some miracles among the people

128
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:32,296
23 Thus passed away the thirty and second year

129
00:12:32,296 --> 00:12:37,546
 also. And Nephi did cry unto the people in the

130
00:12:37,546 --> 00:12:42,796
 commencement of the thirty and third year; and he did

131
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:48,046
 preach unto them repentance and remission of sins

132
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:58,701
24 Now I would have you to remember also, that

133
00:12:58,701 --> 00:13:09,368
 there were none who were brought unto repentance who

134
00:13:09,368 --> 00:13:20,035
 were not baptized with water

135
00:13:20,9 --> 00:13:23,4
25 Therefore, there were ordained of Nephi, men

136
00:13:23,4 --> 00:13:25,9
 unto this ministry, that all such as should come

137
00:13:25,9 --> 00:13:28,4
 unto them should be baptized with water, and this as

138
00:13:28,4 --> 00:13:30,9
 a witness and a testimony before God, and unto the

139
00:13:30,9 --> 00:13:33,4
 people, that they had repented and received a

140
00:13:33,4 --> 00:13:35,9
 remission of their sins

141
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:38,081
26 And there were many in the commencement of this

142
00:13:38,081 --> 00:13:40,414
 year that were baptized unto repentance; and thus

143
00:13:40,414 --> 00:13:42,747
 the more part of the year did pass away.
