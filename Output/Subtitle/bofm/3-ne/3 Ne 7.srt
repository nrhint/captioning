1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 7 The chief judge is murdered, the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
government is destroyed, and the people divide

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
into tribes—Jacob, an anti-Christ, becomes king

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of a secret combination—Nephi preaches

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
repentance and faith in Christ—Angels minister to him

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
daily, and he raises his brother from the

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:27:25,
dead—Many repent and are baptized. About A.D. 30–33. 

8
00:27:25,0 --> 00:27:25,0
1 Now behold, I will show unto you that

9
00:27:25,0 --> 00:27:25,0
they did not establish a king over the land;

10
00:27:25,0 --> 00:27:25,0
but in this same year, yea, the thirtieth

11
00:27:25,0 --> 00:27:25,0
year, they did destroy upon the

12
00:27:25,0 --> 00:30:55,
judgment-seat, yea, did murder the chief judge of the land.

13
00:30:55,0 --> 00:30:55,0
2 And the people were divided one

14
00:30:55,0 --> 00:30:55,0
against another; and they did separate

15
00:30:55,0 --> 00:30:55,0
one from another into tribes, every

16
00:30:55,0 --> 00:30:55,0
man according to his family and his

17
00:30:55,0 --> 00:30:55,0
kindred and friends; and thus they

18
00:30:55,0 --> 00:31:39,
did destroy the government of the land.

19
00:31:39,0 --> 00:31:39,0
3 And every tribe did

20
00:31:39,0 --> 00:31:39,0
appoint a chief or a leader over

21
00:31:39,0 --> 00:31:39,0
them; and thus they became

22
00:31:39,0 --> 00:31:11,
tribes and leaders of tribes.

23
00:31:11,0 --> 00:31:11,0
4 Now behold, there was

24
00:31:11,0 --> 00:31:11,0
no man among them save

25
00:31:11,0 --> 00:31:11,0
he had much family and

26
00:31:11,0 --> 00:31:11,0
many kindreds and friends;

27
00:31:11,0 --> 00:31:11,0
therefore their tribes

28
00:31:11,0 --> 00:30:57,
became exceedingly great.

29
00:30:57,0 --> 00:30:57,0
5 Now all this was

30
00:30:57,0 --> 00:30:57,0
done, and there were no

31
00:30:57,0 --> 00:30:57,0
wars as yet among

32
00:30:57,0 --> 00:30:57,0
them; and all this

33
00:30:57,0 --> 00:30:57,0
iniquity had come upon

34
00:30:57,0 --> 00:30:57,0
the people because they

35
00:30:57,0 --> 00:30:57,0
did yield themselves

36
00:30:57,0 --> 00:30:29,
unto the power of Satan.

37
00:30:29,0 --> 00:30:29,0
6 And the

38
00:30:29,0 --> 00:30:29,0
regulations of the

39
00:30:29,0 --> 00:30:29,0
government were destroyed,

40
00:30:29,0 --> 00:30:29,0
because of the

41
00:30:29,0 --> 00:30:29,0
secret combination of

42
00:30:29,0 --> 00:30:29,0
the friends and

43
00:30:29,0 --> 00:30:29,0
kindreds of those who

44
00:30:29,0 --> 00:31:41,
murdered the prophets.

45
00:31:41,0 --> 00:31:41,0
7 And they did

46
00:31:41,0 --> 00:31:41,0
cause a great

47
00:31:41,0 --> 00:31:41,0
contention in the land,

48
00:31:41,0 --> 00:31:41,0
insomuch that the

49
00:31:41,0 --> 00:31:41,0
more righteous part

50
00:31:41,0 --> 00:31:41,0
of the people had

51
00:31:41,0 --> 00:31:41,0
nearly all become

52
00:31:41,0 --> 00:31:41,0
wicked; yea,

53
00:31:41,0 --> 00:31:41,0
there were but few

54
00:31:41,0 --> 00:35:53,
righteous men among them.

55
00:35:53,0 --> 00:35:53,0
8 And thus six

56
00:35:53,0 --> 00:35:53,0
years had not

57
00:35:53,0 --> 00:35:53,0
passed away since

58
00:35:53,0 --> 00:35:53,0
the more part of

59
00:35:53,0 --> 00:35:53,0
the people had

60
00:35:53,0 --> 00:35:53,0
turned from their

61
00:35:53,0 --> 00:35:53,0
righteousness,

62
00:35:53,0 --> 00:35:53,0
like the dog to

63
00:35:53,0 --> 00:35:53,0
his vomit, or

64
00:35:53,0 --> 00:35:53,0
like the sow to

65
00:35:53,0 --> 00:39:23,
her wallowing in the mire.

66
00:39:23,0 --> 00:39:23,0
9 Now this

67
00:39:23,0 --> 00:39:23,0
secret combination,

68
00:39:23,0 --> 00:39:23,0
which had

69
00:39:23,0 --> 00:39:23,0
brought so great

70
00:39:23,0 --> 00:39:23,0
iniquity upon the

71
00:39:23,0 --> 00:39:23,0
people, did

72
00:39:23,0 --> 00:39:23,0
gather themselves

73
00:39:23,0 --> 00:39:23,0
together, and

74
00:39:23,0 --> 00:39:23,0
did place at

75
00:39:23,0 --> 00:39:23,0
their head a man

76
00:39:23,0 --> 00:39:37,
whom they did call Jacob;

77
00:39:37,0 --> 00:39:37,0
10 And they

78
00:39:37,0 --> 00:39:37,0
did call him

79
00:39:37,0 --> 00:39:37,0
their king;

80
00:39:37,0 --> 00:39:37,0
therefore he became

81
00:39:37,0 --> 00:39:37,0
a king over

82
00:39:37,0 --> 00:39:37,0
this wicked

83
00:39:37,0 --> 00:39:37,0
band; and he was

84
00:39:37,0 --> 00:39:37,0
one of the

85
00:39:37,0 --> 00:39:37,0
chiefest who had

86
00:39:37,0 --> 00:39:37,0
given his

87
00:39:37,0 --> 00:39:37,0
voice against the

88
00:39:37,0 --> 00:39:37,0
prophets who

89
00:39:37,0 --> 00:43:07,
testified of Jesus.

90
00:43:07,0 --> 00:43:07,0
11 And it

91
00:43:07,0 --> 00:43:07,0
came to pass

92
00:43:07,0 --> 00:43:07,0
that they were

93
00:43:07,0 --> 00:43:07,0
not so strong

94
00:43:07,0 --> 00:43:07,0
in number as

95
00:43:07,0 --> 00:43:07,0
the tribes of

96
00:43:07,0 --> 00:43:07,0
the people,

97
00:43:07,0 --> 00:43:07,0
who were

98
00:43:07,0 --> 00:43:07,0
united together

99
00:43:07,0 --> 00:43:07,0
save it were

100
00:43:07,0 --> 00:43:07,0
their leaders

101
00:43:07,0 --> 00:43:07,0
did establish

102
00:43:07,0 --> 00:43:07,0
their laws,

103
00:43:07,0 --> 00:43:07,0
every one

104
00:43:07,0 --> 00:43:07,0
according to his

105
00:43:07,0 --> 00:43:07,0
tribe;

106
00:43:07,0 --> 00:43:07,0
nevertheless they

107
00:43:07,0 --> 00:43:07,0
were enemies;

108
00:43:07,0 --> 00:43:07,0


109
00:43:07,0 --> 00:43:07,0
notwithstanding they were

110
00:43:07,0 --> 00:43:07,0
not a

111
00:43:07,0 --> 00:43:07,0
righteous people,

112
00:43:07,0 --> 00:43:07,0
yet they were

113
00:43:07,0 --> 00:43:07,0
united in the

114
00:43:07,0 --> 00:43:07,0
hatred of

115
00:43:07,0 --> 00:43:07,0
those who had

116
00:43:07,0 --> 00:43:07,0
entered into a

117
00:43:07,0 --> 00:42:39,
covenant to destroy the government.

118
00:42:39,0 --> 00:42:39,0
12

119
00:42:39,0 --> 00:42:39,0
Therefore, Jacob

120
00:42:39,0 --> 00:42:39,0
seeing that

121
00:42:39,0 --> 00:42:39,0
their enemies

122
00:42:39,0 --> 00:42:39,0
were more

123
00:42:39,0 --> 00:42:39,0
numerous than

124
00:42:39,0 --> 00:42:39,0
they, he being

125
00:42:39,0 --> 00:42:39,0
the king of

126
00:42:39,0 --> 00:42:39,0
the band,

127
00:42:39,0 --> 00:42:39,0
therefore he

128
00:42:39,0 --> 00:42:39,0
commanded

129
00:42:39,0 --> 00:42:39,0
his people

130
00:42:39,0 --> 00:42:39,0
that they

131
00:42:39,0 --> 00:42:39,0
should take their

132
00:42:39,0 --> 00:42:39,0
flight into

133
00:42:39,0 --> 00:42:39,0
the

134
00:42:39,0 --> 00:42:39,0
northernmost part

135
00:42:39,0 --> 00:42:39,0
of the land,

136
00:42:39,0 --> 00:42:39,0
and there

137
00:42:39,0 --> 00:42:39,0
build up unto

138
00:42:39,0 --> 00:42:39,0
themselves a

139
00:42:39,0 --> 00:42:39,0
kingdom,

140
00:42:39,0 --> 00:42:39,0
until they

141
00:42:39,0 --> 00:42:39,0
were joined by

142
00:42:39,0 --> 00:42:39,0
dissenters,

143
00:42:39,0 --> 00:42:39,0
(for he

144
00:42:39,0 --> 00:42:39,0
flattered them

145
00:42:39,0 --> 00:42:39,0
that there

146
00:42:39,0 --> 00:42:39,0
would be many

147
00:42:39,0 --> 00:42:39,0
dissenters)

148
00:42:39,0 --> 00:42:39,0
and they

149
00:42:39,0 --> 00:42:39,0
become

150
00:42:39,0 --> 00:42:39,0
sufficiently strong

151
00:42:39,0 --> 00:42:39,0
to contend

152
00:42:39,0 --> 00:44:23,
with the tribes of the people; and they did so.

153
00:44:23,0 --> 00:44:23,0
13 And so

154
00:44:23,0 --> 00:44:23,0
speedy was

155
00:44:23,0 --> 00:44:23,0
their march

156
00:44:23,0 --> 00:44:23,0
that it could

157
00:44:23,0 --> 00:44:23,0
not be

158
00:44:23,0 --> 00:44:23,0
impeded until they

159
00:44:23,0 --> 00:44:23,0
had gone

160
00:44:23,0 --> 00:44:23,0
forth out of

161
00:44:23,0 --> 00:44:23,0
the reach of

162
00:44:23,0 --> 00:44:23,0
the people.

163
00:44:23,0 --> 00:44:23,0
And thus

164
00:44:23,0 --> 00:44:23,0
ended the

165
00:44:23,0 --> 00:44:23,0
thirtieth year;

166
00:44:23,0 --> 00:44:23,0
and thus were

167
00:44:23,0 --> 00:44:23,0
the affairs

168
00:44:23,0 --> 00:44:23,0
of the

169
00:44:23,0 --> 00:45:07,
people of Nephi.

170
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
14 And it

171
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
came to pass

172
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
in the

173
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
thirty and

174
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
first year

175
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
that they were

176
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
divided

177
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
into tribes,

178
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
every man

179
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
according to

180
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
his

181
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
family, kindred

182
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
and friends;

183
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0


184
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
nevertheless they had

185
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
come to an

186
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
agreement

187
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
that they

188
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
would not go

189
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
to war one

190
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
with

191
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
another; but

192
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
they were not

193
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
united as

194
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
to their

195
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
laws, and

196
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
their manner of

197
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0


198
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
government, for they

199
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
were

200
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
established

201
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
according to the

202
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
minds of

203
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
those who

204
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
were their

205
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
chiefs and

206
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
their

207
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
leaders. But they

208
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
did

209
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
establish very

210
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
strict laws

211
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
that one

212
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
tribe should

213
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
not trespass

214
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
against

215
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
another,

216
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
insomuch that in

217
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
some

218
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
degree they had

219
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
peace in

220
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
the land;

221
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
nevertheless,

222
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
their

223
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
hearts were

224
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
turned from the

225
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
Lord their

226
00:45:07,0 --> 00:45:07,0
God, and

227
00:45:07,0 --> 00:44:39,
they did stone the prophets and did cast them out from among them.

228
00:44:39,0 --> 00:44:39,0
15 And it

229
00:44:39,0 --> 00:44:39,0
came to

230
00:44:39,0 --> 00:44:39,0
pass that

231
00:44:39,0 --> 00:44:39,0
Nephi—having

232
00:44:39,0 --> 00:44:39,0
been

233
00:44:39,0 --> 00:44:39,0
visited by

234
00:44:39,0 --> 00:44:39,0
angels and

235
00:44:39,0 --> 00:44:39,0
also the

236
00:44:39,0 --> 00:44:39,0
voice of the

237
00:44:39,0 --> 00:44:39,0
Lord,

238
00:44:39,0 --> 00:44:39,0
therefore

239
00:44:39,0 --> 00:44:39,0
having seen

240
00:44:39,0 --> 00:44:39,0
angels, and

241
00:44:39,0 --> 00:44:39,0
being

242
00:44:39,0 --> 00:44:39,0
eye-witness,

243
00:44:39,0 --> 00:44:39,0
and having

244
00:44:39,0 --> 00:44:39,0
had power

245
00:44:39,0 --> 00:44:39,0
given unto

246
00:44:39,0 --> 00:44:39,0
him that

247
00:44:39,0 --> 00:44:39,0
he might

248
00:44:39,0 --> 00:44:39,0
know

249
00:44:39,0 --> 00:44:39,0
concerning the

250
00:44:39,0 --> 00:44:39,0
ministry of

251
00:44:39,0 --> 00:44:39,0
Christ,

252
00:44:39,0 --> 00:44:39,0
and also

253
00:44:39,0 --> 00:44:39,0
being

254
00:44:39,0 --> 00:44:39,0
eye-witness to

255
00:44:39,0 --> 00:44:39,0
their quick

256
00:44:39,0 --> 00:44:39,0
return

257
00:44:39,0 --> 00:44:39,0
from

258
00:44:39,0 --> 00:44:39,0
righteousness

259
00:44:39,0 --> 00:46:51,
unto their wickedness and abominations;

260
00:46:51,0 --> 00:46:51,0
16

261
00:46:51,0 --> 00:46:51,0
Therefore,

262
00:46:51,0 --> 00:46:51,0
being grieved

263
00:46:51,0 --> 00:46:51,0
for the

264
00:46:51,0 --> 00:46:51,0
hardness

265
00:46:51,0 --> 00:46:51,0
of their

266
00:46:51,0 --> 00:46:51,0
hearts

267
00:46:51,0 --> 00:46:51,0
and the

268
00:46:51,0 --> 00:46:51,0
blindness of

269
00:46:51,0 --> 00:46:51,0
their

270
00:46:51,0 --> 00:46:51,0
minds—went

271
00:46:51,0 --> 00:46:51,0
forth

272
00:46:51,0 --> 00:46:51,0
among them

273
00:46:51,0 --> 00:46:51,0
in that

274
00:46:51,0 --> 00:46:51,0
same year,

275
00:46:51,0 --> 00:46:51,0
and began

276
00:46:51,0 --> 00:46:51,0
to

277
00:46:51,0 --> 00:46:51,0
testify,

278
00:46:51,0 --> 00:46:51,0
boldly,

279
00:46:51,0 --> 00:46:51,0
repentance and

280
00:46:51,0 --> 00:46:51,0
remission

281
00:46:51,0 --> 00:46:51,0
of sins

282
00:46:51,0 --> 00:46:51,0
through

283
00:46:51,0 --> 00:46:23,
faith on the Lord Jesus Christ.

284
00:46:23,0 --> 00:46:23,0
17 And

285
00:46:23,0 --> 00:46:23,0
he did

286
00:46:23,0 --> 00:46:23,0
minister

287
00:46:23,0 --> 00:46:23,0
many

288
00:46:23,0 --> 00:46:23,0
things unto

289
00:46:23,0 --> 00:46:23,0
them;

290
00:46:23,0 --> 00:46:23,0
and all of

291
00:46:23,0 --> 00:46:23,0
them

292
00:46:23,0 --> 00:46:23,0
cannot be

293
00:46:23,0 --> 00:46:23,0
written,

294
00:46:23,0 --> 00:46:23,0
and a

295
00:46:23,0 --> 00:46:23,0
part of

296
00:46:23,0 --> 00:46:23,0
them

297
00:46:23,0 --> 00:46:23,0
would not

298
00:46:23,0 --> 00:46:23,0
suffice,

299
00:46:23,0 --> 00:46:23,0
therefore

300
00:46:23,0 --> 00:46:23,0
they

301
00:46:23,0 --> 00:46:23,0
are not

302
00:46:23,0 --> 00:46:23,0
written in

303
00:46:23,0 --> 00:46:23,0
this

304
00:46:23,0 --> 00:46:23,0
book. And

305
00:46:23,0 --> 00:46:23,0
Nephi

306
00:46:23,0 --> 00:46:23,0
did

307
00:46:23,0 --> 00:46:23,0
minister with

308
00:46:23,0 --> 00:59:31,
power and with great authority.

309
00:59:31,0 --> 00:59:31,0
18 And

310
00:59:31,0 --> 00:59:31,0
it came

311
00:59:31,0 --> 00:59:31,0
to

312
00:59:31,0 --> 00:59:31,0
pass that

313
00:59:31,0 --> 00:59:31,0
they

314
00:59:31,0 --> 00:59:31,0
were

315
00:59:31,0 --> 00:59:31,0
angry with

316
00:59:31,0 --> 00:59:31,0
him,

317
00:59:31,0 --> 00:59:31,0
even

318
00:59:31,0 --> 00:59:31,0
because he

319
00:59:31,0 --> 00:59:31,0
had

320
00:59:31,0 --> 00:59:31,0
greater

321
00:59:31,0 --> 00:59:31,0
power

322
00:59:31,0 --> 00:59:31,0
than they,

323
00:59:31,0 --> 00:59:31,0
for it

324
00:59:31,0 --> 00:59:31,0
were

325
00:59:31,0 --> 00:59:31,0
not

326
00:59:31,0 --> 00:59:31,0
possible

327
00:59:31,0 --> 00:59:31,0
that they

328
00:59:31,0 --> 00:59:31,0
could

329
00:59:31,0 --> 00:59:31,0


330
00:59:31,0 --> 00:59:31,0
disbelieve his

331
00:59:31,0 --> 00:59:31,0
words,

332
00:59:31,0 --> 00:59:31,0
for so

333
00:59:31,0 --> 00:59:31,0
great

334
00:59:31,0 --> 00:59:31,0
was his

335
00:59:31,0 --> 00:59:31,0
faith

336
00:59:31,0 --> 00:59:31,0
on the

337
00:59:31,0 --> 00:59:31,0
Lord

338
00:59:31,0 --> 00:59:31,0
Jesus

339
00:59:31,0 --> 00:59:31,0
Christ

340
00:59:31,0 --> 00:59:03,
that angels did minister unto him daily.

341
00:59:03,0 --> 00:59:03,0
19 And

342
00:59:03,0 --> 00:59:03,0
in

343
00:59:03,0 --> 00:59:03,0
the name

344
00:59:03,0 --> 00:59:03,0
of

345
00:59:03,0 --> 00:59:03,0
Jesus

346
00:59:03,0 --> 00:59:03,0
did he

347
00:59:03,0 --> 00:59:03,0
cast

348
00:59:03,0 --> 00:59:03,0
out

349
00:59:03,0 --> 00:59:03,0
devils and

350
00:59:03,0 --> 00:59:03,0


351
00:59:03,0 --> 00:59:03,0
unclean

352
00:59:03,0 --> 00:59:03,0
spirits;

353
00:59:03,0 --> 00:59:03,0
and

354
00:59:03,0 --> 00:59:03,0
even his

355
00:59:03,0 --> 00:59:03,0


356
00:59:03,0 --> 00:59:03,0
brother did

357
00:59:03,0 --> 00:59:03,0

359
00:59:03,0 --> 00:59:03,0

360
00:59:03,0 --> 00:59:03,0
dead,

361
00:59:03,0 --> 00:59:03,0
after

362
00:59:03,0 --> 00:59:03,0
he

363
00:59:03,0 --> 00:59:03,0
had been

364
00:59:03,0 --> 00:59:03,0


365
00:59:03,0 --> 00:59:03,0
stoned and

366
00:59:03,0 --> 00:58:35,
suffered death by the people.

367
00:58:35,0 --> 00:58:35,0
20

368
00:58:35,0 --> 00:58:35,0
And the

372
00:58:35,0 --> 00:58:35,0
and

373
00:58:35,0 --> 00:58:35,0
did

374
00:58:35,0 --> 00:58:35,0


375
00:58:35,0 --> 00:58:35,0
witness of

376
00:58:35,0 --> 00:58:35,0

380
00:58:35,0 --> 00:58:35,0
with

381
00:58:35,0 --> 00:58:35,0

00:58:35,0 --> 00:58:35,0
and

387
00:58:35,0 --> 00:58:35,0
he did

388
