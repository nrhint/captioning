1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:07,714
Chapter 7 The chief judge is murdered, the

2
00:00:07,714 --> 00:00:15,428
government is destroyed, and the people divide

3
00:00:15,428 --> 00:00:23,142
into tribes—Jacob, an anti-Christ, becomes king

4
00:00:23,142 --> 00:00:30,856
of a secret combination—Nephi preaches

5
00:00:30,856 --> 00:00:38,57
repentance and faith in Christ—Angels minister to him

6
00:00:38,57 --> 00:00:46,284
daily, and he raises his brother from the

7
00:00:46,284 --> 00:00:54,888
dead—Many repent and are baptized. About A.D. 30–33. 

8
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:55,888
1 Now behold, I will show unto you that

9
00:00:55,888 --> 00:00:56,888
they did not establish a king over the land;

10
00:00:56,888 --> 00:00:57,888
but in this same year, yea, the thirtieth

11
00:00:57,888 --> 00:00:58,888
year, they did destroy upon the

12
00:00:58,888 --> 00:00:59,293
judgment-seat, yea, did murder the chief judge of the land.

13
00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:01,293
2 And the people were divided one

14
00:01:01,293 --> 00:01:03,293
against another; and they did separate

15
00:01:03,293 --> 00:01:05,293
one from another into tribes, every

16
00:01:05,293 --> 00:01:07,293
man according to his family and his

17
00:01:07,293 --> 00:01:09,293
kindred and friends; and thus they

18
00:01:09,293 --> 00:01:11,672
did destroy the government of the land.

19
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:13,672
3 And every tribe did

20
00:01:13,672 --> 00:01:15,672
appoint a chief or a leader over

21
00:01:15,672 --> 00:01:17,672
them; and thus they became

22
00:01:17,672 --> 00:01:19,646
tribes and leaders of tribes.

23
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:20,479
4 Now behold, there was

24
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:21,312
no man among them save

25
00:01:21,312 --> 00:01:22,145
he had much family and

26
00:01:22,145 --> 00:01:22,978
many kindreds and friends;

27
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:23,811
therefore their tribes

28
00:01:23,811 --> 00:01:24,051
became exceedingly great.

29
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:23,926
5 Now all this was

30
00:01:23,926 --> 00:01:23,801
done, and there were no

31
00:01:23,801 --> 00:01:23,676
wars as yet among

32
00:01:23,676 --> 00:01:23,551
them; and all this

33
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:23,426
iniquity had come upon

34
00:01:23,426 --> 00:01:23,301
the people because they

35
00:01:23,301 --> 00:01:23,176
did yield themselves

36
00:01:23,176 --> 00:01:23,116
unto the power of Satan.

37
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:23,616
6 And the

38
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:24,116
regulations of the

39
00:01:24,116 --> 00:01:24,616
government were destroyed,

40
00:01:24,616 --> 00:01:25,116
because of the

41
00:01:25,116 --> 00:01:25,616
secret combination of

42
00:01:25,616 --> 00:01:26,116
the friends and

43
00:01:26,116 --> 00:01:26,616
kindreds of those who

44
00:01:26,616 --> 00:01:27,521
murdered the prophets.

45
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:27,721
7 And they did

46
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:27,921
cause a great

47
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:28,121
contention in the land,

48
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:28,321
insomuch that the

49
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:28,521
more righteous part

50
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:28,721
of the people had

51
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:28,921
nearly all become

52
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:29,121
wicked; yea,

53
00:01:29,121 --> 00:01:29,321
there were but few

54
00:01:29,321 --> 00:01:29,923
righteous men among them.

55
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:30,923
8 And thus six

56
00:01:30,923 --> 00:01:31,923
years had not

57
00:01:31,923 --> 00:01:32,923
passed away since

58
00:01:32,923 --> 00:01:33,923
the more part of

59
00:01:33,923 --> 00:01:34,923
the people had

60
00:01:34,923 --> 00:01:35,923
turned from their

61
00:01:35,923 --> 00:01:36,923
righteousness,

62
00:01:36,923 --> 00:01:37,923
like the dog to

63
00:01:37,923 --> 00:01:38,923
his vomit, or

64
00:01:38,923 --> 00:01:39,923
like the sow to

65
00:01:39,923 --> 00:01:40,867
her wallowing in the mire.

66
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:41,322
9 Now this

67
00:01:41,322 --> 00:01:41,777
secret combination,

68
00:01:41,777 --> 00:01:42,232
which had

69
00:01:42,232 --> 00:01:42,687
brought so great

70
00:01:42,687 --> 00:01:43,142
iniquity upon the

71
00:01:43,142 --> 00:01:43,597
people, did

72
00:01:43,597 --> 00:01:44,052
gather themselves

73
00:01:44,052 --> 00:01:44,507
together, and

74
00:01:44,507 --> 00:01:44,962
did place at

75
00:01:44,962 --> 00:01:45,417
their head a man

76
00:01:45,417 --> 00:01:45,272
whom they did call Jacob;

77
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:45,58
10 And they

78
00:01:45,58 --> 00:01:45,888
did call him

79
00:01:45,888 --> 00:01:46,196
their king;

80
00:01:46,196 --> 00:01:46,504
therefore he became

81
00:01:46,504 --> 00:01:46,812
a king over

82
00:01:46,812 --> 00:01:47,12
this wicked

83
00:01:47,12 --> 00:01:47,428
band; and he was

84
00:01:47,428 --> 00:01:47,736
one of the

85
00:01:47,736 --> 00:01:48,044
chiefest who had

86
00:01:48,044 --> 00:01:48,352
given his

87
00:01:48,352 --> 00:01:48,66
voice against the

88
00:01:48,66 --> 00:01:48,968
prophets who

89
00:01:48,968 --> 00:01:49,676
testified of Jesus.

90
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:49,64
11 And it

91
00:01:49,64 --> 00:01:49,604
came to pass

92
00:01:49,604 --> 00:01:49,568
that they were

93
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:49,532
not so strong

94
00:01:49,532 --> 00:01:49,496
in number as

95
00:01:49,496 --> 00:01:49,46
the tribes of

96
00:01:49,46 --> 00:01:49,424
the people,

97
00:01:49,424 --> 00:01:49,388
who were

98
00:01:49,388 --> 00:01:49,352
united together

99
00:01:49,352 --> 00:01:49,316
save it were

100
00:01:49,316 --> 00:01:49,28
their leaders

101
00:01:49,28 --> 00:01:49,244
did establish

102
00:01:49,244 --> 00:01:49,208
their laws,

103
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:49,172
every one

104
00:01:49,172 --> 00:01:49,136
according to his

105
00:01:49,136 --> 00:01:49,1
tribe;

106
00:01:49,1 --> 00:01:49,064
nevertheless they

107
00:01:49,064 --> 00:01:49,028
were enemies;

108
00:01:49,028 --> 00:01:48,992


109
00:01:48,992 --> 00:01:48,956
notwithstanding they were

110
00:01:48,956 --> 00:01:48,92
not a

111
00:01:48,92 --> 00:01:48,884
righteous people,

112
00:01:48,884 --> 00:01:48,848
yet they were

113
00:01:48,848 --> 00:01:48,812
united in the

114
00:01:48,812 --> 00:01:48,776
hatred of

115
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:48,74
those who had

116
00:01:48,74 --> 00:01:48,704
entered into a

117
00:01:48,704 --> 00:01:48,742
covenant to destroy the government.

118
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:48,885
12

119
00:01:48,885 --> 00:01:49,028
Therefore, Jacob

120
00:01:49,028 --> 00:01:49,171
seeing that

121
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:49,314
their enemies

122
00:01:49,314 --> 00:01:49,457
were more

123
00:01:49,457 --> 00:01:49,6
numerous than

124
00:01:49,6 --> 00:01:49,743
they, he being

125
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:49,886
the king of

126
00:01:49,886 --> 00:01:50,029
the band,

127
00:01:50,029 --> 00:01:50,172
therefore he

128
00:01:50,172 --> 00:01:50,315
commanded

129
00:01:50,315 --> 00:01:50,458
his people

130
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:50,601
that they

131
00:01:50,601 --> 00:01:50,744
should take their

132
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:50,887
flight into

133
00:01:50,887 --> 00:01:51,03
the

134
00:01:51,03 --> 00:01:51,173
northernmost part

135
00:01:51,173 --> 00:01:51,316
of the land,

136
00:01:51,316 --> 00:01:51,459
and there

137
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:51,602
build up unto

138
00:01:51,602 --> 00:01:51,745
themselves a

139
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:51,888
kingdom,

140
00:01:51,888 --> 00:01:52,031
until they

141
00:01:52,031 --> 00:01:52,174
were joined by

142
00:01:52,174 --> 00:01:52,317
dissenters,

143
00:01:52,317 --> 00:01:52,46
(for he

144
00:01:52,46 --> 00:01:52,603
flattered them

145
00:01:52,603 --> 00:01:52,746
that there

146
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:52,889
would be many

147
00:01:52,889 --> 00:01:53,032
dissenters)

148
00:01:53,032 --> 00:01:53,175
and they

149
00:01:53,175 --> 00:01:53,318
become

150
00:01:53,318 --> 00:01:53,461
sufficiently strong

151
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:53,604
to contend

152
00:01:53,604 --> 00:01:53,146
with the tribes of the people; and they did so.

153
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:54,087
13 And so

154
00:01:54,087 --> 00:01:55,028
speedy was

155
00:01:55,028 --> 00:01:55,969
their march

156
00:01:55,969 --> 00:01:56,91
that it could

157
00:01:56,91 --> 00:01:57,851
not be

158
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:58,792
impeded until they

159
00:01:58,792 --> 00:01:59,733
had gone

160
00:01:59,733 --> 00:02:00,674
forth out of

161
00:02:00,674 --> 00:02:01,615
the reach of

162
00:02:01,615 --> 00:02:02,556
the people.

163
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:03,497
And thus

164
00:02:03,497 --> 00:02:04,438
ended the

165
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:05,379
thirtieth year;

166
00:02:05,379 --> 00:02:06,32
and thus were

167
00:02:06,32 --> 00:02:07,261
the affairs

168
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:08,202
of the

169
00:02:08,202 --> 00:02:09,563
people of Nephi.

170
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:09,546
14 And it

171
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:09,529
came to pass

172
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:09,512
in the

173
00:02:09,512 --> 00:02:09,495
thirty and

174
00:02:09,495 --> 00:02:09,478
first year

175
00:02:09,478 --> 00:02:09,461
that they were

176
00:02:09,461 --> 00:02:09,444
divided

177
00:02:09,444 --> 00:02:09,427
into tribes,

178
00:02:09,427 --> 00:02:09,41
every man

179
00:02:09,41 --> 00:02:09,393
according to

180
00:02:09,393 --> 00:02:09,376
his

181
00:02:09,376 --> 00:02:09,359
family, kindred

182
00:02:09,359 --> 00:02:09,342
and friends;

183
00:02:09,342 --> 00:02:09,325


184
00:02:09,325 --> 00:02:09,308
nevertheless they had

185
00:02:09,308 --> 00:02:09,291
come to an

186
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:09,274
agreement

187
00:02:09,274 --> 00:02:09,257
that they

188
00:02:09,257 --> 00:02:09,24
would not go

189
00:02:09,24 --> 00:02:09,223
to war one

190
00:02:09,223 --> 00:02:09,206
with

191
00:02:09,206 --> 00:02:09,189
another; but

192
00:02:09,189 --> 00:02:09,172
they were not

193
00:02:09,172 --> 00:02:09,155
united as

194
00:02:09,155 --> 00:02:09,138
to their

195
00:02:09,138 --> 00:02:09,121
laws, and

196
00:02:09,121 --> 00:02:09,104
their manner of

197
00:02:09,104 --> 00:02:09,087


198
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:09,07
government, for they

199
00:02:09,07 --> 00:02:09,053
were

200
00:02:09,053 --> 00:02:09,036
established

201
00:02:09,036 --> 00:02:09,019
according to the

202
00:02:09,019 --> 00:02:09,002
minds of

203
00:02:09,002 --> 00:02:08,985
those who

204
00:02:08,985 --> 00:02:08,968
were their

205
00:02:08,968 --> 00:02:08,951
chiefs and

206
00:02:08,951 --> 00:02:08,934
their

207
00:02:08,934 --> 00:02:08,917
leaders. But they

208
00:02:08,917 --> 00:02:08,9
did

209
00:02:08,9 --> 00:02:08,883
establish very

210
00:02:08,883 --> 00:02:08,866
strict laws

211
00:02:08,866 --> 00:02:08,849
that one

212
00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:08,832
tribe should

213
00:02:08,832 --> 00:02:08,815
not trespass

214
00:02:08,815 --> 00:02:08,798
against

215
00:02:08,798 --> 00:02:08,781
another,

216
00:02:08,781 --> 00:02:08,764
insomuch that in

217
00:02:08,764 --> 00:02:08,747
some

218
00:02:08,747 --> 00:02:08,73
degree they had

219
00:02:08,73 --> 00:02:08,713
peace in

220
00:02:08,713 --> 00:02:08,696
the land;

221
00:02:08,696 --> 00:02:08,679
nevertheless,

222
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:08,662
their

223
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:08,645
hearts were

224
00:02:08,645 --> 00:02:08,628
turned from the

225
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:08,611
Lord their

226
00:02:08,611 --> 00:02:08,594
God, and

227
00:02:08,594 --> 00:02:08,629
they did stone the prophets and did cast them out from among them.

228
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:08,722
15 And it

229
00:02:08,722 --> 00:02:08,816
came to

230
00:02:08,816 --> 00:02:08,911
pass that

231
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:09,005
Nephi—having

232
00:02:09,005 --> 00:02:09,099
been

233
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:09,192
visited by

234
00:02:09,192 --> 00:02:09,286
angels and

235
00:02:09,286 --> 00:02:09,381
also the

236
00:02:09,381 --> 00:02:09,475
voice of the

237
00:02:09,475 --> 00:02:09,569
Lord,

238
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:09,662
therefore

239
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:09,757
having seen

240
00:02:09,757 --> 00:02:09,851
angels, and

241
00:02:09,851 --> 00:02:09,945
being

242
00:02:09,945 --> 00:02:10,038
eye-witness,

243
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:10,132
and having

244
00:02:10,132 --> 00:02:10,227
had power

245
00:02:10,227 --> 00:02:10,321
given unto

246
00:02:10,321 --> 00:02:10,415
him that

247
00:02:10,415 --> 00:02:10,508
he might

248
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:10,602
know

249
00:02:10,602 --> 00:02:10,697
concerning the

250
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:10,791
ministry of

251
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:10,885
Christ,

252
00:02:10,885 --> 00:02:10,978
and also

253
00:02:10,978 --> 00:02:11,072
being

254
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,167
eye-witness to

255
00:02:11,167 --> 00:02:11,261
their quick

256
00:02:11,261 --> 00:02:11,355
return

257
00:02:11,355 --> 00:02:11,448
from

258
00:02:11,448 --> 00:02:11,542
righteousness

259
00:02:11,542 --> 00:02:11,031
unto their wickedness and abominations;

260
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:11,989
16

261
00:02:11,989 --> 00:02:12,947
Therefore,

262
00:02:12,947 --> 00:02:13,905
being grieved

263
00:02:13,905 --> 00:02:14,863
for the

264
00:02:14,863 --> 00:02:15,821
hardness

265
00:02:15,821 --> 00:02:16,779
of their

266
00:02:16,779 --> 00:02:17,737
hearts

267
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:18,695
and the

268
00:02:18,695 --> 00:02:19,653
blindness of

269
00:02:19,653 --> 00:02:20,611
their

270
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:21,569
minds—went

271
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:22,527
forth

272
00:02:22,527 --> 00:02:23,485
among them

273
00:02:23,485 --> 00:02:24,443
in that

274
00:02:24,443 --> 00:02:25,401
same year,

275
00:02:25,401 --> 00:02:26,359
and began

276
00:02:26,359 --> 00:02:27,317
to

277
00:02:27,317 --> 00:02:28,275
testify,

278
00:02:28,275 --> 00:02:29,233
boldly,

279
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:30,191
repentance and

280
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,149
remission

281
00:02:31,149 --> 00:02:32,107
of sins

282
00:02:32,107 --> 00:02:33,065
through

283
00:02:33,065 --> 00:02:34,021
faith on the Lord Jesus Christ.

284
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:33,981
17 And

285
00:02:33,981 --> 00:02:33,941
he did

286
00:02:33,941 --> 00:02:33,901
minister

287
00:02:33,901 --> 00:02:33,861
many

288
00:02:33,861 --> 00:02:33,821
things unto

289
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:33,781
them;

290
00:02:33,781 --> 00:02:33,741
and all of

291
00:02:33,741 --> 00:02:33,701
them

292
00:02:33,701 --> 00:02:33,661
cannot be

293
00:02:33,661 --> 00:02:33,621
written,

294
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:33,581
and a

295
00:02:33,581 --> 00:02:33,541
part of

296
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:33,501
them

297
00:02:33,501 --> 00:02:33,461
would not

298
00:02:33,461 --> 00:02:33,421
suffice,

299
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:33,381
therefore

300
00:02:33,381 --> 00:02:33,341
they

301
00:02:33,341 --> 00:02:33,301
are not

302
00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:33,261
written in

303
00:02:33,261 --> 00:02:33,221
this

304
00:02:33,221 --> 00:02:33,181
book. And

305
00:02:33,181 --> 00:02:33,141
Nephi

306
00:02:33,141 --> 00:02:33,101
did

307
00:02:33,101 --> 00:02:33,061
minister with

308
00:02:33,061 --> 00:02:33,086
power and with great authority.

309
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:33,055
18 And

310
00:02:33,055 --> 00:02:33,024
it came

311
00:02:33,024 --> 00:02:32,993
to

312
00:02:32,993 --> 00:02:32,962
pass that

313
00:02:32,962 --> 00:02:32,931
they

314
00:02:32,931 --> 00:02:32,9
were

315
00:02:32,9 --> 00:02:32,869
angry with

316
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:32,838
him,

317
00:02:32,838 --> 00:02:32,807
even

318
00:02:32,807 --> 00:02:32,776
because he

319
00:02:32,776 --> 00:02:32,745
had

320
00:02:32,745 --> 00:02:32,714
greater

321
00:02:32,714 --> 00:02:32,683
power

322
00:02:32,683 --> 00:02:32,652
than they,

323
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:32,621
for it

324
00:02:32,621 --> 00:02:32,59
were

325
00:02:32,59 --> 00:02:32,559
not

326
00:02:32,559 --> 00:02:32,528
possible

327
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:32,497
that they

328
00:02:32,497 --> 00:02:32,466
could

329
00:02:32,466 --> 00:02:32,435


330
00:02:32,435 --> 00:02:32,404
disbelieve his

331
00:02:32,404 --> 00:02:32,373
words,

332
00:02:32,373 --> 00:02:32,342
for so

333
00:02:32,342 --> 00:02:32,311
great

334
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:32,28
was his

335
00:02:32,28 --> 00:02:32,249
faith

336
00:02:32,249 --> 00:02:32,218
on the

337
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:32,187
Lord

338
00:02:32,187 --> 00:02:32,156
Jesus

339
00:02:32,156 --> 00:02:32,125
Christ

340
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:32,152
that angels did minister unto him daily.

341
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:32,306
19 And

342
00:02:32,306 --> 00:02:32,46
in

343
00:02:32,46 --> 00:02:32,614
the name

344
00:02:32,614 --> 00:02:32,768
of

345
00:02:32,768 --> 00:02:32,922
Jesus

346
00:02:32,922 --> 00:02:33,076
did he

347
00:02:33,076 --> 00:02:33,23
cast

348
00:02:33,23 --> 00:02:33,384
out

349
00:02:33,384 --> 00:02:33,538
devils and

350
00:02:33,538 --> 00:02:33,692


351
00:02:33,692 --> 00:02:33,846
unclean

352
00:02:33,846 --> 00:02:34,0
spirits;

353
00:02:34,0 --> 00:02:34,154
and

354
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:34,308
even his

355
00:02:34,308 --> 00:02:34,462


356
00:02:34,462 --> 00:02:34,616
brother did

357
00:02:34,616 --> 00:02:34,77
he

00:02:34,77 --> 00:02:34,924
raise

359
00:02:34,924 --> 00:02:35,078

00:02:35,078 --> 00:02:35,232
dead,

361
00:02:35,232 --> 00:02:35,386
after

362
00:02:35,386 --> 00:02:35,54
he

363
00:02:35,54 --> 00:02:35,694
had been

364
00:02:35,694 --> 00:02:35,848


365
00:02:35,848 --> 00:02:36,002
stoned and

366
00:02:36,002 --> 00:02:36,556
suffered death by the people.

367
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:36,524
20

368
00:02:36,524 --> 00:02:36,492
And the

369
00:02:36,492 --> 00:02:36,46


370
00:02:36,46 --> 00:02:36,428
people

371
00:02:36,428 --> 00:02:36,396
saw it,

372
00:02:36,396 --> 00:02:36,364
and

373
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:36,332
did

374

377
00:02:36,236 --> 00:02:36,204
and

378
00:02:36,204 --> 00:02:36,172

379
00:02:36,172 --> 00:02:36,14
angry

380
00:02:36,14 --> 00:02:36,108
with

381
00:02:36,108 --> 00:02:36,076
him

382
00:02:36,076 --> 00:02:36,044
because

383
00:02:36,044 --> 00:02:36,012

his

385
00:02:35,98 --> 00:02:35,948
power;

386
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:35,916

387
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:35,884
he did

388
00:02:35,884 --> 00:02:35,852
