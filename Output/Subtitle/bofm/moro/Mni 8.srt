Chapter 8 The baptism of little children is

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
an evil abomination—Little children are

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
alive in Christ because of the Atonement—Faith,

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
repentance, meekness and lowliness of heart,

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
receiving the Holy Ghost, and enduring to

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:09:10,
the end lead to salvation. About A.D. 401–21. 

7
00:09:10,0 --> 00:09:10,0
1 An epistle of my father Mormon, written

8
00:09:10,0 --> 00:09:10,0
to me, Moroni; and it was written unto me

9
00:09:10,0 --> 00:09:10,0
soon after my calling to the ministry. And

10
00:09:10,0 --> 00:20:53,
on this wise did he write unto me, saying:

11
00:20:53,0 --> 00:20:53,0
2 My beloved son, Moroni, I rejoice

12
00:20:53,0 --> 00:20:53,0
exceedingly that your Lord Jesus Christ hath

13
00:20:53,0 --> 00:20:53,0
been mindful of you, and hath called

14
00:20:53,0 --> 00:22:05,
you to his ministry, and to his holy work.

15
00:22:05,0 --> 00:22:05,0
3 I am mindful of you always in my

16
00:22:05,0 --> 00:22:05,0
prayers, continually praying unto God the

17
00:22:05,0 --> 00:22:05,0
Father in the name of his Holy Child,

18
00:22:05,0 --> 00:22:05,0
Jesus, that he, through his infinite goodness

19
00:22:05,0 --> 00:22:05,0
and grace, will keep you through the

20
00:22:05,0 --> 00:21:37,
endurance of faith on his name to the end.

21
00:21:37,0 --> 00:21:37,0
4 And now, my son, I speak unto you

22
00:21:37,0 --> 00:21:37,0
concerning that which grieveth me

23
00:21:37,0 --> 00:21:37,0
exceedingly; for it grieveth me that

24
00:21:37,0 --> 00:23:49,
there should disputations rise among you.

25
00:23:49,0 --> 00:23:49,0
5 For, if I have learned the

26
00:23:49,0 --> 00:23:49,0
truth, there have been

27
00:23:49,0 --> 00:23:49,0
disputations among you concerning the

28
00:23:49,0 --> 00:24:47,
baptism of your little children.

29
00:24:47,0 --> 00:24:47,0
6 And now, my son, I desire

30
00:24:47,0 --> 00:24:47,0
that ye should labor

31
00:24:47,0 --> 00:24:47,0
diligently, that this gross

32
00:24:47,0 --> 00:24:47,0
error should be removed from

33
00:24:47,0 --> 00:24:47,0
among you; for, for this

34
00:24:47,0 --> 00:28:17,
intent I have written this epistle.

35
00:28:17,0 --> 00:28:17,0
7 For immediately after I

36
00:28:17,0 --> 00:28:17,0
had learned these things

37
00:28:17,0 --> 00:28:17,0
of you I inquired of the

38
00:28:17,0 --> 00:28:17,0
Lord concerning the

39
00:28:17,0 --> 00:28:17,0
matter. And the word of the

40
00:28:17,0 --> 00:28:17,0
Lord came to me by the

41
00:28:17,0 --> 00:31:48,
power of the Holy Ghost, saying:

42
00:31:48,0 --> 00:31:48,0
8 Listen to the words of

43
00:31:48,0 --> 00:31:48,0
Christ, your Redeemer,

44
00:31:48,0 --> 00:31:48,0
your Lord and your God.

45
00:31:48,0 --> 00:31:48,0
Behold, I came into the

46
00:31:48,0 --> 00:31:48,0
world not to call the

47
00:31:48,0 --> 00:31:48,0
righteous but sinners to

48
00:31:48,0 --> 00:31:48,0
repentance; the whole

49
00:31:48,0 --> 00:31:48,0
need no physician, but they

50
00:31:48,0 --> 00:31:48,0
that are sick;

51
00:31:48,0 --> 00:31:48,0
wherefore, little children are

52
00:31:48,0 --> 00:31:48,0
whole, for they are not

53
00:31:48,0 --> 00:31:48,0
capable of committing

54
00:31:48,0 --> 00:31:48,0
sin; wherefore the curse of

55
00:31:48,0 --> 00:31:48,0
Adam is taken from them

56
00:31:48,0 --> 00:31:48,0
in me, that it hath no

57
00:31:48,0 --> 00:31:48,0
power over them; and the

58
00:31:48,0 --> 00:31:20,
law of circumcision is done away in me.

59
00:31:20,0 --> 00:31:20,0
9 And after this manner

60
00:31:20,0 --> 00:31:20,0
did the Holy Ghost

61
00:31:20,0 --> 00:31:20,0
manifest the word of God

62
00:31:20,0 --> 00:31:20,0
unto me; wherefore, my

63
00:31:20,0 --> 00:31:20,0
beloved son, I know that

64
00:31:20,0 --> 00:31:20,0
it is solemn mockery

65
00:31:20,0 --> 00:31:20,0
before God, that ye

66
00:31:20,0 --> 00:30:52,
should baptize little children.

67
00:30:52,0 --> 00:30:52,0
10 Behold I say unto

68
00:30:52,0 --> 00:30:52,0
you that this thing

69
00:30:52,0 --> 00:30:52,0
shall ye

70
00:30:52,0 --> 00:30:52,0
teach—repentance and baptism unto

71
00:30:52,0 --> 00:30:52,0
those who are

72
00:30:52,0 --> 00:30:52,0
accountable and capable of

73
00:30:52,0 --> 00:30:52,0
committing sin; yea,

74
00:30:52,0 --> 00:30:52,0
teach parents that

75
00:30:52,0 --> 00:30:52,0
they must repent and be

76
00:30:52,0 --> 00:30:52,0
baptized, and humble

77
00:30:52,0 --> 00:30:52,0
themselves as their

78
00:30:52,0 --> 00:30:52,0
little children, and

79
00:30:52,0 --> 00:30:52,0
they shall all be

80
00:30:52,0 --> 00:30:24,
saved with their little children.

81
00:30:24,0 --> 00:30:24,0
11 And their little

82
00:30:24,0 --> 00:30:24,0
children need no

83
00:30:24,0 --> 00:30:24,0
repentance, neither

84
00:30:24,0 --> 00:30:24,0
baptism. Behold,

85
00:30:24,0 --> 00:30:24,0
baptism is unto repentance

86
00:30:24,0 --> 00:30:24,0
to the fulfilling

87
00:30:24,0 --> 00:30:24,0
the commandments unto

88
00:30:24,0 --> 00:30:38,
the remission of sins.

89
00:30:38,0 --> 00:30:38,0
12 But little

90
00:30:38,0 --> 00:30:38,0
children are alive in

91
00:30:38,0 --> 00:30:38,0
Christ, even from

92
00:30:38,0 --> 00:30:38,0
the foundation of

93
00:30:38,0 --> 00:30:38,0
the world; if not

94
00:30:38,0 --> 00:30:38,0
so, God is a

95
00:30:38,0 --> 00:30:38,0
partial God, and also a

96
00:30:38,0 --> 00:30:38,0
changeable God,

97
00:30:38,0 --> 00:30:38,0
and a respecter to

98
00:30:38,0 --> 00:30:38,0
persons; for how

99
00:30:38,0 --> 00:30:38,0
many little

100
00:30:38,0 --> 00:30:10,
children have died without baptism!

101
00:30:10,0 --> 00:30:10,0
13 Wherefore,

102
00:30:10,0 --> 00:30:10,0
if little

103
00:30:10,0 --> 00:30:10,0
children could not be

104
00:30:10,0 --> 00:30:10,0
saved without

105
00:30:10,0 --> 00:30:10,0
baptism, these

106
00:30:10,0 --> 00:30:10,0
must have gone

107
00:30:10,0 --> 00:31:22,
to an endless hell.

108
00:31:22,0 --> 00:31:22,0
14 Behold I

109
00:31:22,0 --> 00:31:22,0
say unto you,

110
00:31:22,0 --> 00:31:22,0
that he that

111
00:31:22,0 --> 00:31:22,0
supposeth that

112
00:31:22,0 --> 00:31:22,0
little children

113
00:31:22,0 --> 00:31:22,0
need baptism

114
00:31:22,0 --> 00:31:22,0
is in the gall

115
00:31:22,0 --> 00:31:22,0
of bitterness

116
00:31:22,0 --> 00:31:22,0
and in the

117
00:31:22,0 --> 00:31:22,0
bonds of

118
00:31:22,0 --> 00:31:22,0
iniquity; for he hath

119
00:31:22,0 --> 00:31:22,0
neither faith,

120
00:31:22,0 --> 00:31:22,0
hope, nor

121
00:31:22,0 --> 00:31:22,0
charity;

122
00:31:22,0 --> 00:31:22,0
wherefore, should he

123
00:31:22,0 --> 00:31:22,0
be cut off

124
00:31:22,0 --> 00:31:22,0
while in the

125
00:31:22,0 --> 00:30:54,
thought, he must go down to hell.

126
00:30:54,0 --> 00:30:54,0
15 For awful

127
00:30:54,0 --> 00:30:54,0
is the

128
00:30:54,0 --> 00:30:54,0
wickedness to

129
00:30:54,0 --> 00:30:54,0
suppose that

130
00:30:54,0 --> 00:30:54,0
God saveth

131
00:30:54,0 --> 00:30:54,0
one child

132
00:30:54,0 --> 00:30:54,0
because of

133
00:30:54,0 --> 00:30:54,0
baptism, and the

134
00:30:54,0 --> 00:30:54,0
other must

135
00:30:54,0 --> 00:30:54,0
perish

136
00:30:54,0 --> 00:30:26,
because he hath no baptism.

137
00:30:26,0 --> 00:30:26,0
16 Wo be

138
00:30:26,0 --> 00:30:26,0
unto them

139
00:30:26,0 --> 00:30:26,0
that shall

140
00:30:26,0 --> 00:30:26,0
pervert the

141
00:30:26,0 --> 00:30:26,0
ways of the

142
00:30:26,0 --> 00:30:26,0
Lord after

143
00:30:26,0 --> 00:30:26,0
this manner,

144
00:30:26,0 --> 00:30:26,0
for they

145
00:30:26,0 --> 00:30:26,0
shall perish

146
00:30:26,0 --> 00:30:26,0
except

147
00:30:26,0 --> 00:30:26,0
they repent.

148
00:30:26,0 --> 00:30:26,0
Behold, I

149
00:30:26,0 --> 00:30:26,0
speak with

150
00:30:26,0 --> 00:30:26,0
boldness,

151
00:30:26,0 --> 00:30:26,0
having

152
00:30:26,0 --> 00:30:26,0
authority from

153
00:30:26,0 --> 00:30:26,0
God; and I

154
00:30:26,0 --> 00:30:26,0
fear not what

155
00:30:26,0 --> 00:30:26,0
man can do;

156
00:30:26,0 --> 00:30:26,0
for

157
00:30:26,0 --> 00:30:40,
perfect love casteth out all fear.

158
00:30:40,0 --> 00:30:40,0
17 And I

159
00:30:40,0 --> 00:30:40,0
am filled

160
00:30:40,0 --> 00:30:40,0
with

161
00:30:40,0 --> 00:30:40,0
charity, which

162
00:30:40,0 --> 00:30:40,0
is

163
00:30:40,0 --> 00:30:40,0
everlasting love;

164
00:30:40,0 --> 00:30:40,0
wherefore,

165
00:30:40,0 --> 00:30:40,0
all

166
00:30:40,0 --> 00:30:40,0
children are

167
00:30:40,0 --> 00:30:40,0
alike unto

168
00:30:40,0 --> 00:30:40,0
me;

169
00:30:40,0 --> 00:30:40,0
wherefore, I love

170
00:30:40,0 --> 00:30:40,0
little

171
00:30:40,0 --> 00:30:40,0
children

172
00:30:40,0 --> 00:30:40,0
with a

173
00:30:40,0 --> 00:30:40,0
perfect love;

174
00:30:40,0 --> 00:30:40,0
and they are

175
00:30:40,0 --> 00:30:40,0
all alike

176
00:30:40,0 --> 00:30:12,
and partakers of salvation.

177
00:30:12,0 --> 00:30:12,0
18 For I

178
00:30:12,0 --> 00:30:12,0
know that

179
00:30:12,0 --> 00:30:12,0
God is not

180
00:30:12,0 --> 00:30:12,0
a partial

181
00:30:12,0 --> 00:30:12,0
God,

182
00:30:12,0 --> 00:30:12,0
neither a

183
00:30:12,0 --> 00:30:12,0
changeable

184
00:30:12,0 --> 00:30:12,0
being; but he

185
00:30:12,0 --> 00:30:12,0
is

186
00:30:12,0 --> 00:30:12,0
unchangeable from

187
00:30:12,0 --> 00:30:12,0
all

188
00:30:12,0 --> 00:30:12,0
eternity to all

189
00:30:12,0 --> 00:31:24,
eternity.

190
00:31:24,0 --> 00:31:24,0
19 Little

191
00:31:24,0 --> 00:31:24,0
children

192
00:31:24,0 --> 00:31:24,0
cannot

193
00:31:24,0 --> 00:31:24,0
repent;

194
00:31:24,0 --> 00:31:24,0
wherefore,

195
00:31:24,0 --> 00:31:24,0
it is

196
00:31:24,0 --> 00:31:24,0
awful

197
00:31:24,0 --> 00:31:24,0
wickedness to

198
00:31:24,0 --> 00:31:24,0
deny the

199
00:31:24,0 --> 00:31:24,0
pure

200
00:31:24,0 --> 00:31:24,0
mercies of God

201
00:31:24,0 --> 00:31:24,0
unto

202
00:31:24,0 --> 00:31:24,0
them, for

203
00:31:24,0 --> 00:31:24,0
they are

204
00:31:24,0 --> 00:31:24,0
all alive

205
00:31:24,0 --> 00:31:24,0
in him

206
00:31:24,0 --> 00:30:56,
because of his mercy.

207
00:30:56,0 --> 00:30:56,0
20 And

208
00:30:56,0 --> 00:30:56,0
he that

209
00:30:56,0 --> 00:30:56,0
saith

210
00:30:56,0 --> 00:30:56,0
that little

211
00:30:56,0 --> 00:30:56,0


212
00:30:56,0 --> 00:30:56,0
children need

213
00:30:56,0 --> 00:30:56,0
baptism

214
00:30:56,0 --> 00:30:56,0
denieth

215
00:30:56,0 --> 00:30:56,0
the

216
00:30:56,0 --> 00:30:56,0
mercies of

217
00:30:56,0 --> 00:30:56,0
Christ,

218
00:30:56,0 --> 00:30:56,0
and

219
00:30:56,0 --> 00:30:56,0
setteth at

220
00:30:56,0 --> 00:30:56,0
naught the

221
00:30:56,0 --> 00:30:56,0


222
00:30:56,0 --> 00:30:56,0
atonement of him

223
00:30:56,0 --> 00:30:56,0
and the

224
00:30:56,0 --> 00:30:28,

225
00:30:28,0 --> 00:30:28,0
21 Wo

00:30:28,0 --> 00:30:28,0
hell,

234
00:30:28,0 --> 00:30:28,0
endless

235
00:30:28,0 --> 00:30:28,0


236
00:30:28,0 --> 00:30:28,0
torment. I

237
00:30:28,0 --> 00:30:28,0
speak it

238
00:30:28,0 --> 00:30:28,0

239
00:30:28,0 --> 00:30:28,0
God

00:30:28,0 --> 00:30:28,0
Listen unto

244
00:30:28,0 --> 00:30:28,0

the judgment-seat of Christ.

252
00:30:42,0 --> 00:30:42,0
22 For

00:30:42,0 --> 00:30:42,0
all them

277
00:30:42,0 --> 00:30:42,0

279
00:30:42,0 --> 00:30:42,0
no law;

280
00:30:42,0 --> 00:30:42,0


281
00:30:42,0 --> 00:30:42,0
wherefore,

282
00:30:42,0 --> 00:30:42,0
he

283
00:30:42,0 --> 00:30:42,0

287
00:30:42,0 --> 00:30:42,0
he that

289
00:30:42,0 --> 00:30:42,0
under no

291
00:30:42,0 --> 00:30:42,0


292
00:30:42,0 --> 00:30:42,0

293
00:30:42,0 --> 00:30:42,0
cannot

294
00:30:42,0 --> 00:30:14,
repent; and unto such baptism availeth nothing—

295
00:30:14,0 --> 00:30:14,0
23

296
00:30:14,0 --> 00:30:14,0
But it

297
00:30:14,0 --> 00:30:14,0
is

298
00:30:14,0 --> 00:30:14,0
mockery

299
00:30:14,0 --> 00:30:14,0

302
00:30:14,0 --> 00:30:14,0
denying

315
00:30:14,0 --> 00:30:14,0
and

316
00:30:14,0 --> 00:31:26,
putting trust in dead works.

317

Behold,

325
00:31:26,0 --> 00:31:26,0
ought

326
00:31:26,0 --> 00:31:26,0

743
00:31:28,0 --> 00:31:28,0
29 And after rejecting so great a knowledge, my son, they must perish soon, unto the fulfilling of the prophecies which were spoken by the prophets, as well as the words of our Savior

744
