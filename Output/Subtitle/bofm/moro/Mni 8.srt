00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:07,333
Chapter 8 The baptism of little children is an

2
00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:14,666
 evil abomination—Little children are alive in Christ

3
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:21,999
 because of the Atonement—Faith, repentance,

4
00:00:21,999 --> 00:00:29,332
 meekness and lowliness of heart, receiving the Holy

5
00:00:29,332 --> 00:00:36,665
 Ghost, and enduring to the end lead to salvation.

7
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:50,695
1 An epistle of my father Mormon, written to me,

8
00:00:50,695 --> 00:00:56,445
 Moroni; and it was written unto me soon after my

9
00:00:56,445 --> 00:01:02,195
 calling to the ministry. And on this wise did he

10
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:07,945
 write unto me, saying

11
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:13,484
2 My beloved son, Moroni, I rejoice exceedingly

12
00:01:13,484 --> 00:01:19,734
 that your Lord Jesus Christ hath been mindful of

13
00:01:19,734 --> 00:01:25,984
 you, and hath called you to his ministry, and to his

14
00:01:25,984 --> 00:01:32,234
 holy work

15
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,759
3 I am mindful of you always in my prayers,

16
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:43,359
 continually praying unto God the Father in the name of

17
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:48,959
 his Holy Child, Jesus, that he, through his

18
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:54,559
 infinite goodness and grace, will keep you through the

19
00:01:54,559 --> 00:02:00,159
 endurance of faith on his name to the end

20
00:02:00,12 --> 00:02:15,787
4 And now, my son, I speak unto you concerning

21
00:02:15,787 --> 00:02:31,454
 that which grieveth me exceedingly; for it grieveth

22
00:02:31,454 --> 00:02:47,121
 me that there should disputations rise among you

23
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:50,301
5 For, if I have learned the truth, there have

24
00:02:50,301 --> 00:02:52,634
 been disputations among you concerning the baptism of

25
00:02:52,634 --> 00:02:54,967
 your little children

26
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:54,557
6 And now, my son, I desire that ye should labor

27
00:02:54,557 --> 00:02:54,807
 diligently, that this gross error should be removed

28
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:55,057
 from among you; for, for this intent I have

29
00:02:55,057 --> 00:02:55,307
 written this epistle

30
00:02:55,208 --> 00:03:12,958
7 For immediately after I had learned these things

31
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:30,708
 of you I inquired of the Lord concerning the

32
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:48,458
 matter. And the word of the Lord came to me by the

33
00:03:48,458 --> 00:04:06,208
 power of the Holy Ghost, saying

34
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:11,612
8 Listen to the words of Christ, your Redeemer,

35
00:04:11,612 --> 00:04:16,945
 your Lord and your God. Behold, I came into the

36
00:04:16,945 --> 00:04:22,278
 world not to call the righteous but sinners to

37
00:04:22,278 --> 00:04:27,611
 repentance; the whole need no physician, but they that

38
00:04:27,611 --> 00:04:32,944
 are sick; wherefore, little children are whole, for

39
00:04:32,944 --> 00:04:38,277
 they are not capable of committing sin; wherefore

40
00:04:38,277 --> 00:04:43,61
 the curse of Adam is taken from them in me, that

41
00:04:43,61 --> 00:04:48,943
 it hath no power over them; and the law of

42
00:04:48,943 --> 00:04:54,276
 circumcision is done away in me

43
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:54,127
9 And after this manner did the Holy Ghost

44
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:54,127
 manifest the word of God unto me; wherefore, my beloved

45
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:54,127
 son, I know that it is solemn mockery before God,

46
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:54,127
 that ye should baptize little children

47
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:59,157
10 Behold I say unto you that this thing shall ye

48
00:04:59,157 --> 00:05:03,586
 teach—repentance and baptism unto those who are

49
00:05:03,586 --> 00:05:08,015
 accountable and capable of committing sin; yea,

50
00:05:08,015 --> 00:05:12,444
 teach parents that they must repent and be baptized,

51
00:05:12,444 --> 00:05:16,873
 and humble themselves as their little children, and

52
00:05:16,873 --> 00:05:21,302
 they shall all be saved with their little

53
00:05:21,302 --> 00:05:25,731
 children

54
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:31,192
11 And their little children need no repentance,

55
00:05:31,192 --> 00:05:37,192
 neither baptism. Behold, baptism is unto repentance

56
00:05:37,192 --> 00:05:43,192
 to the fulfilling the commandments unto the

57
00:05:43,192 --> 00:05:49,192
 remission of sins

58
00:05:49,95 --> 00:05:56,95
12 But little children are alive in Christ, even

59
00:05:56,95 --> 00:06:03,95
 from the foundation of the world; if not so, God is

60
00:06:03,95 --> 00:06:10,95
 a partial God, and also a changeable God, and a

61
00:06:10,95 --> 00:06:17,95
 respecter to persons; for how many little children

62
00:06:17,95 --> 00:06:24,95
 have died without baptism

63
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:28,784
13 Wherefore, if little children could not be

64
00:06:28,784 --> 00:06:33,117
 saved without baptism, these must have gone to an

65
00:06:33,117 --> 00:06:37,45
 endless hell

66
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:43,33
14 Behold I say unto you, that he that supposeth

67
00:06:43,33 --> 00:06:49,163
 that little children need baptism is in the gall of

68
00:06:49,163 --> 00:06:54,996
 bitterness and in the bonds of iniquity; for he

69
00:06:54,996 --> 00:07:00,829
 hath neither faith, hope, nor charity; wherefore,

70
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:06,662
 should he be cut off while in the thought, he must

71
00:07:06,662 --> 00:07:12,495
 go down to hell

72
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:19,166
15 For awful is the wickedness to suppose that God

73
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:25,833
 saveth one child because of baptism, and the

74
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:32,5
 other must perish because he hath no baptism

75
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:39,252
16 Wo be unto them that shall pervert the ways of

76
00:07:39,252 --> 00:07:46,252
 the Lord after this manner, for they shall perish

77
00:07:46,252 --> 00:07:53,252
 except they repent. Behold, I speak with boldness,

78
00:07:53,252 --> 00:08:00,252
 having authority from God; and I fear not what

79
00:08:00,252 --> 00:08:07,252
 man can do; for perfect love casteth out all fear

80
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:12,787
17 And I am filled with charity, which is

81
00:08:12,787 --> 00:08:18,387
 everlasting love; wherefore, all children are alike unto

82
00:08:18,387 --> 00:08:23,987
 me; wherefore, I love little children with a

83
00:08:23,987 --> 00:08:29,587
 perfect love; and they are all alike and partakers of

84
00:08:29,587 --> 00:08:35,187
 salvation

85
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:42,215
18 For I know that God is not a partial God,

86
00:08:42,215 --> 00:08:49,215
 neither a changeable being; but he is unchangeable from

87
00:08:49,215 --> 00:08:56,215
 all eternity to all eternity

88
00:08:56,336 --> 00:09:07,336
19 Little children cannot repent; wherefore, it is

89
00:09:07,336 --> 00:09:18,336
 awful wickedness to deny the pure mercies of God

90
00:09:18,336 --> 00:09:29,336
 unto them, for they are all alive in him because

91
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:40,336
 of his mercy

92
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:40,996
20 And he that saith that little children need

93
00:09:40,996 --> 00:09:41,746
 baptism denieth the mercies of Christ, and setteth at

94
00:09:41,746 --> 00:09:42,496
 naught the atonement of him and the power of his

95
00:09:42,496 --> 00:09:43,246
 redemption

96
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:49,283
21 Wo unto such, for they are in danger of death,

97
00:09:49,283 --> 00:09:55,482
 hell, and an endless torment. I speak it boldly;

98
00:09:55,482 --> 00:10:01,683
 God hath commanded me. Listen unto them and give

99
00:10:01,683 --> 00:10:07,882
 heed, or they stand against you at the judgment-seat

100
00:10:07,882 --> 00:10:14,082
 of Christ

101
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:22,481
22 For behold that all little children are alive

102
00:10:22,481 --> 00:10:29,981
 in Christ, and also all they that are without the

103
00:10:29,981 --> 00:10:37,481
 law. For the power of redemption cometh on all them

104
00:10:37,481 --> 00:10:44,981
 that have no law; wherefore, he that is not

105
00:10:44,981 --> 00:10:52,481
 condemned, or he that is under no condemnation, cannot

106
00:10:52,481 --> 00:10:59,981
 repent; and unto such baptism availeth nothing

107
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:05,725
23 But it is mockery before God, denying the

108
00:11:05,725 --> 00:11:12,392
 mercies of Christ, and the power of his Holy Spirit,

109
00:11:12,392 --> 00:11:19,059
 and putting trust in dead works

110
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:26,145
24 Behold, my son, this thing ought not to be; for

111
00:11:26,145 --> 00:11:32,478
 repentance is unto them that are under

112
00:11:32,478 --> 00:11:38,811
 condemnation and under the curse of a broken law

113
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:44,898
25 And the first fruits of repentance is baptism;

114
00:11:44,898 --> 00:11:50,898
 and baptism cometh by faith unto the fulfilling

115
00:11:50,898 --> 00:11:56,898
 the commandments; and the fulfilling the

116
00:11:56,898 --> 00:12:02,898
 commandments bringeth remission of sins

117
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:08,393
26 And the remission of sins bringeth meekness,

118
00:12:08,393 --> 00:12:13,964
 and lowliness of heart; and because of meekness and

119
00:12:13,964 --> 00:12:19,535
 lowliness of heart cometh the visitation of the

120
00:12:19,535 --> 00:12:25,106
 Holy Ghost, which Comforter filleth with hope and

121
00:12:25,106 --> 00:12:30,677
 perfect love, which love endureth by diligence unto

122
00:12:30,677 --> 00:12:36,248
 prayer, until the end shall come, when all the

123
00:12:36,248 --> 00:12:41,819
 saints shall dwell with God

124
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:59,595
27 Behold, my son, I will write unto you again if

125
00:12:59,595 --> 00:13:17,195
 I go not out soon against the Lamanites. Behold,

126
00:13:17,195 --> 00:13:34,795
 the pride of this nation, or the people of the

127
00:13:34,795 --> 00:13:52,395
 Nephites, hath proven their destruction except they

128
00:13:52,395 --> 00:14:09,995
 should repent

129
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:48,848
30 Farewell, my son, until I shall write unto you,

130
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:49,848
 or shall meet you again. Amen.
