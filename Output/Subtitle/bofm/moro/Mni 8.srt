00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:07,0
Chapter 8 The baptism of little children is

2
00:00:07,0 --> 00:00:14,0
an evil abomination—Little children are

3
00:00:14,0 --> 00:00:21,0
alive in Christ because of the Atonement—Faith,

4
00:00:21,0 --> 00:00:28,0
repentance, meekness and lowliness of heart,

5
00:00:28,0 --> 00:00:35,0
receiving the Holy Ghost, and enduring to

6
00:00:35,0 --> 00:00:42,276
the end lead to salvation. About A.D. 401–21. 

7
00:00:42,276 --> 00:00:42,026
1 An epistle of my father Mormon, written

8
00:00:42,026 --> 00:00:41,776
to me, Moroni; and it was written unto me

9
00:00:41,776 --> 00:00:41,526
soon after my calling to the ministry. And

10
00:00:41,526 --> 00:00:41,341
on this wise did he write unto me, saying:

11
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:41,841
2 My beloved son, Moroni, I rejoice

12
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:42,341
exceedingly that your Lord Jesus Christ hath

13
00:00:42,341 --> 00:00:42,841
been mindful of you, and hath called

14
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:43,744
you to his ministry, and to his holy work.

15
00:00:43,744 --> 00:00:47,577
3 I am mindful of you always in my

16
00:00:47,577 --> 00:00:51,41
prayers, continually praying unto God the

17
00:00:51,41 --> 00:00:55,243
Father in the name of his Holy Child,

18
00:00:55,243 --> 00:00:59,076
Jesus, that he, through his infinite goodness

19
00:00:59,076 --> 00:01:02,909
and grace, will keep you through the

20
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:06,733
endurance of faith on his name to the end.

21
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:07,983
4 And now, my son, I speak unto you

22
00:01:07,983 --> 00:01:09,233
concerning that which grieveth me

23
00:01:09,233 --> 00:01:10,483
exceedingly; for it grieveth me that

24
00:01:10,483 --> 00:01:11,138
there should disputations rise among you.

25
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:14,638
5 For, if I have learned the

26
00:01:14,638 --> 00:01:18,138
truth, there have been

27
00:01:18,138 --> 00:01:21,638
disputations among you concerning the

28
00:01:21,638 --> 00:01:25,419
baptism of your little children.

29
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:25,752
6 And now, my son, I desire

30
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:26,085
that ye should labor

31
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:26,418
diligently, that this gross

32
00:01:26,418 --> 00:01:26,751
error should be removed from

33
00:01:26,751 --> 00:01:27,084
among you; for, for this

34
00:01:27,084 --> 00:01:27,821
intent I have written this epistle.

35
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:27,678
7 For immediately after I

36
00:01:27,678 --> 00:01:27,535
had learned these things

37
00:01:27,535 --> 00:01:27,392
of you I inquired of the

38
00:01:27,392 --> 00:01:27,249
Lord concerning the

39
00:01:27,249 --> 00:01:27,106
matter. And the word of the

40
00:01:27,106 --> 00:01:26,963
Lord came to me by the

41
00:01:26,963 --> 00:01:26,887
power of the Holy Ghost, saying:

42
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:26,828
8 Listen to the words of

43
00:01:26,828 --> 00:01:26,769
Christ, your Redeemer,

44
00:01:26,769 --> 00:01:26,71
your Lord and your God.

45
00:01:26,71 --> 00:01:26,651
Behold, I came into the

46
00:01:26,651 --> 00:01:26,592
world not to call the

47
00:01:26,592 --> 00:01:26,533
righteous but sinners to

48
00:01:26,533 --> 00:01:26,474
repentance; the whole

49
00:01:26,474 --> 00:01:26,415
need no physician, but they

50
00:01:26,415 --> 00:01:26,356
that are sick;

51
00:01:26,356 --> 00:01:26,297
wherefore, little children are

52
00:01:26,297 --> 00:01:26,238
whole, for they are not

53
00:01:26,238 --> 00:01:26,179
capable of committing

54
00:01:26,179 --> 00:01:26,12
sin; wherefore the curse of

55
00:01:26,12 --> 00:01:26,061
Adam is taken from them

56
00:01:26,061 --> 00:01:26,002
in me, that it hath no

57
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:25,943
power over them; and the

58
00:01:25,943 --> 00:01:25,953
law of circumcision is done away in me.

59
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:26,328
9 And after this manner

60
00:01:26,328 --> 00:01:26,703
did the Holy Ghost

61
00:01:26,703 --> 00:01:27,078
manifest the word of God

62
00:01:27,078 --> 00:01:27,453
unto me; wherefore, my

63
00:01:27,453 --> 00:01:27,828
beloved son, I know that

64
00:01:27,828 --> 00:01:28,203
it is solemn mockery

65
00:01:28,203 --> 00:01:28,578
before God, that ye

66
00:01:28,578 --> 00:01:28,355
should baptize little children.

67
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:28,284
10 Behold I say unto

68
00:01:28,284 --> 00:01:28,213
you that this thing

69
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:28,142
shall ye

70
00:01:28,142 --> 00:01:28,071
teach—repentance and baptism unto

71
00:01:28,071 --> 00:01:27,0
those who are

72
00:01:27,0 --> 00:01:27,929
accountable and capable of

73
00:01:27,929 --> 00:01:27,858
committing sin; yea,

74
00:01:27,858 --> 00:01:27,787
teach parents that

75
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:27,716
they must repent and be

76
00:01:27,716 --> 00:01:27,645
baptized, and humble

77
00:01:27,645 --> 00:01:27,574
themselves as their

78
00:01:27,574 --> 00:01:27,503
little children, and

79
00:01:27,503 --> 00:01:27,432
they shall all be

80
00:01:27,432 --> 00:01:27,421
saved with their little children.

81
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,671
11 And their little

82
00:01:29,671 --> 00:01:31,921
children need no

83
00:01:31,921 --> 00:01:34,171
repentance, neither

84
00:01:34,171 --> 00:01:36,421
baptism. Behold,

85
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:38,671
baptism is unto repentance

86
00:01:38,671 --> 00:01:40,921
to the fulfilling

87
00:01:40,921 --> 00:01:43,171
the commandments unto

88
00:01:43,171 --> 00:01:45,739
the remission of sins.

89
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:46,489
12 But little

90
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:47,239
children are alive in

91
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:47,989
Christ, even from

92
00:01:47,989 --> 00:01:48,739
the foundation of

93
00:01:48,739 --> 00:01:49,489
the world; if not

94
00:01:49,489 --> 00:01:50,239
so, God is a

95
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:50,989
partial God, and also a

96
00:01:50,989 --> 00:01:51,739
changeable God,

97
00:01:51,739 --> 00:01:52,489
and a respecter to

98
00:01:52,489 --> 00:01:53,239
persons; for how

99
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:53,989
many little

100
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:54,715
children have died without baptism!

101
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:55,144
13 Wherefore,

102
00:01:55,144 --> 00:01:55,573
if little

103
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:56,002
children could not be

104
00:01:56,002 --> 00:01:56,431
saved without

105
00:01:56,431 --> 00:01:56,86
baptism, these

106
00:01:56,86 --> 00:01:57,289
must have gone

107
00:01:57,289 --> 00:01:57,117
to an endless hell.

108
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:57,339
14 Behold I

109
00:01:57,339 --> 00:01:57,561
say unto you,

110
00:01:57,561 --> 00:01:57,783
that he that

111
00:01:57,783 --> 00:01:58,005
supposeth that

112
00:01:58,005 --> 00:01:58,227
little children

113
00:01:58,227 --> 00:01:58,449
need baptism

114
00:01:58,449 --> 00:01:58,671
is in the gall

115
00:01:58,671 --> 00:01:58,893
of bitterness

116
00:01:58,893 --> 00:01:59,115
and in the

117
00:01:59,115 --> 00:01:59,337
bonds of

118
00:01:59,337 --> 00:01:59,559
iniquity; for he hath

119
00:01:59,559 --> 00:01:59,781
neither faith,

120
00:01:59,781 --> 00:02:00,003
hope, nor

121
00:02:00,003 --> 00:02:00,225
charity;

122
00:02:00,225 --> 00:02:00,447
wherefore, should he

123
00:02:00,447 --> 00:02:00,669
be cut off

124
00:02:00,669 --> 00:02:00,891
while in the

125
00:02:00,891 --> 00:02:01,521
thought, he must go down to hell.

126
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:02,794
15 For awful

127
00:02:02,794 --> 00:02:04,067
is the

128
00:02:04,067 --> 00:02:05,34
wickedness to

129
00:02:05,34 --> 00:02:06,613
suppose that

130
00:02:06,613 --> 00:02:07,886
God saveth

131
00:02:07,886 --> 00:02:09,159
one child

132
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:10,432
because of

133
00:02:10,432 --> 00:02:11,705
baptism, and the

134
00:02:11,705 --> 00:02:12,978
other must

135
00:02:12,978 --> 00:02:14,251
perish

136
00:02:14,251 --> 00:02:15,802
because he hath no baptism.

137
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:16,659
16 Wo be

138
00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:17,516
unto them

139
00:02:17,516 --> 00:02:18,373
that shall

140
00:02:18,373 --> 00:02:19,23
pervert the

141
00:02:19,23 --> 00:02:20,087
ways of the

142
00:02:20,087 --> 00:02:20,944
Lord after

143
00:02:20,944 --> 00:02:21,801
this manner,

144
00:02:21,801 --> 00:02:22,658
for they

145
00:02:22,658 --> 00:02:23,515
shall perish

146
00:02:23,515 --> 00:02:24,372
except

147
00:02:24,372 --> 00:02:25,229
they repent.

148
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:26,086
Behold, I

149
00:02:26,086 --> 00:02:26,943
speak with

150
00:02:26,943 --> 00:02:27,8
boldness,

151
00:02:27,8 --> 00:02:28,657
having

152
00:02:28,657 --> 00:02:29,514
authority from

153
00:02:29,514 --> 00:02:30,371
God; and I

154
00:02:30,371 --> 00:02:31,228
fear not what

155
00:02:31,228 --> 00:02:32,085
man can do;

156
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:32,942
for

157
00:02:32,942 --> 00:02:33,22
perfect love casteth out all fear.

158
00:02:33,22 --> 00:02:33,431
17 And I

159
00:02:33,431 --> 00:02:33,642
am filled

160
00:02:33,642 --> 00:02:33,853
with

161
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:34,064
charity, which

162
00:02:34,064 --> 00:02:34,275
is

163
00:02:34,275 --> 00:02:34,486
everlasting love;

164
00:02:34,486 --> 00:02:34,697
wherefore,

165
00:02:34,697 --> 00:02:34,908
all

166
00:02:34,908 --> 00:02:35,119
children are

167
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:35,33
alike unto

168
00:02:35,33 --> 00:02:35,541
me;

169
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:35,752
wherefore, I love

170
00:02:35,752 --> 00:02:35,963
little

171
00:02:35,963 --> 00:02:36,174
children

172
00:02:36,174 --> 00:02:36,385
with a

173
00:02:36,385 --> 00:02:36,596
perfect love;

174
00:02:36,596 --> 00:02:36,807
and they are

175
00:02:36,807 --> 00:02:37,018
all alike

176
00:02:37,018 --> 00:02:37,624
and partakers of salvation.

177
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:38,701
18 For I

178
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:39,778
know that

179
00:02:39,778 --> 00:02:40,855
God is not

180
00:02:40,855 --> 00:02:41,932
a partial

181
00:02:41,932 --> 00:02:43,009
God,

182
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:44,086
neither a

183
00:02:44,086 --> 00:02:45,163
changeable

184
00:02:45,163 --> 00:02:46,24
being; but he

185
00:02:46,24 --> 00:02:47,317
is

186
00:02:47,317 --> 00:02:48,394
unchangeable from

187
00:02:48,394 --> 00:02:49,471
all

188
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:50,548
eternity to all

189
00:02:50,548 --> 00:02:51,905
eternity.

190
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:52,787
19 Little

191
00:02:52,787 --> 00:02:53,669
children

192
00:02:53,669 --> 00:02:54,551
cannot

193
00:02:54,551 --> 00:02:55,433
repent;

194
00:02:55,433 --> 00:02:56,315
wherefore,

195
00:02:56,315 --> 00:02:57,197
it is

196
00:02:57,197 --> 00:02:58,079
awful

197
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:58,961
wickedness to

198
00:02:58,961 --> 00:02:59,843
deny the

199
00:02:59,843 --> 00:03:00,725
pure

200
00:03:00,725 --> 00:03:01,607
mercies of God

201
00:03:01,607 --> 00:03:02,489
unto

202
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:03,371
them, for

203
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:04,253
they are

204
00:03:04,253 --> 00:03:05,135
all alive

205
00:03:05,135 --> 00:03:06,017
in him

206
00:03:06,017 --> 00:03:06,887
because of his mercy.

207
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:06,887
20 And

208
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:06,887
he that

209
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:06,887
saith

210
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:06,887
that little

211
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:06,887


212
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:06,887
children need

213
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:06,887
baptism

214
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:06,887
denieth

215
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:06,887
the

216
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:06,887
mercies of

217
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:06,887
Christ,

218
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:06,887
and

219
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:06,887
setteth at

220
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:06,887
naught the

221
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:06,887


222
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:06,887
atonement of him

223
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:06,887
and the

224
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:06,42
power of his redemption.

225
00:03:06,42 --> 00:03:06,716
21 Wo

226
00:03:06,716 --> 00:03:07,012
unto

227
00:03:07,012 --> 00:03:07,308
such, for

228
00:03:07,308 --> 00:03:07,604
they

229
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:07,9
are in

230
00:03:07,9 --> 00:03:08,196
danger of

231
00:03:08,196 --> 00:03:08,492
death,

232
00:03:08,492 --> 00:03:08,788
hell,

233
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:09,084
and an

234
00:03:09,084 --> 00:03:09,38
endless

235
00:03:09,38 --> 00:03:09,676


236
00:03:09,676 --> 00:03:09,972
torment. I

237
00:03:09,972 --> 00:03:10,268
speak it

238
00:03:10,268 --> 00:03:10,564
boldly;

239
00:03:10,564 --> 00:03:10,86
God

240
00:03:10,86 --> 00:03:11,156
hath

241
00:03:11,156 --> 00:03:11,452
commanded

242
00:03:11,452 --> 00:03:11,748
me.

243
00:03:11,748 --> 00:03:12,044
Listen unto

244
00:03:12,044 --> 00:03:12,34
them

245
00:03:12,34 --> 00:03:12,636
and give

246
00:03:12,636 --> 00:03:12,932
heed,

247
00:03:12,932 --> 00:03:13,228
or they

248
00:03:13,228 --> 00:03:13,524
stand

249
00:03:13,524 --> 00:03:13,82
against

250
00:03:13,82 --> 00:03:14,116
you at

251
00:03:14,116 --> 00:03:14,861
the judgment-seat of Christ.

252
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:15,163
22 For

253
00:03:15,163 --> 00:03:15,465


254
00:03:15,465 --> 00:03:15,767
behold that

255
00:03:15,767 --> 00:03:16,069
all

256
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:16,371
little

257
00:03:16,371 --> 00:03:16,673


258
00:03:16,673 --> 00:03:16,975
children are

259
00:03:16,975 --> 00:03:17,277
alive

260
00:03:17,277 --> 00:03:17,579
in

261
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:17,881
Christ,

262
00:03:17,881 --> 00:03:18,183
and

263
00:03:18,183 --> 00:03:18,485
also all

264
00:03:18,485 --> 00:03:18,787
they

265
00:03:18,787 --> 00:03:19,089

267
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:19,693
without

268
00:03:19,693 --> 00:03:19,995
the

269
00:03:19,995 --> 00:03:20,297
law. For

270
00:03:20,297 --> 00:03:20,599
the

271
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:20,901
power of

272
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:21,203


273
00:03:21,203 --> 00:03:21,505
redemption

274
00:03:21,505 --> 00:03:21,807
cometh

275
00:03:21,807 --> 00:03:22,109
on

276
00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:22,411
all them

277
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:22,713
that

278
00:03:22,713 --> 00:03:23,015
have

279
00:03:23,015 --> 00:03:23,317
no law;

280
00:03:23,317 --> 00:03:23,619


281
00:03:23,619 --> 00:03:23,921
wherefore,

282
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:24,223
he

283
00:03:24,223 --> 00:03:24,525
that is

284
00:03:24,525 --> 00:03:24,827
not

285
00:03:24,827 --> 00:03:25,129


286
00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:25,431
condemned, or

287
00:03:25,431 --> 00:03:25,733
he that

288
00:03:25,733 --> 00:03:26,035
is

289
00:03:26,035 --> 00:03:26,337
under no

290
00:03:26,337 --> 00:03:26,639


291
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:26,941


292
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:27,243
condemnation,

293
00:03:27,243 --> 00:03:27,545
cannot

294
00:03:27,545 --> 00:03:27,207
repent; and unto such baptism availeth nothing—

295
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,525
23

296
00:03:28,525 --> 00:03:29,843
But it

297
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:31,161
is

298
00:03:31,161 --> 00:03:32,479
mockery

299
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,797


300
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,115
before

301
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:36,433
God,

302
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:37,751
denying

303
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,069
the

304
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:40,387


305
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:41,705
mercies of

00:03:41,705 --> 00:03:43,023


307
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:44,341
Christ,

308
00:03:44,341 --> 00:03:45,659
and

309
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:46,977
the

310
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:48,295
power of

311
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:49,613
his

312
00:03:49,613 --> 00:03:50,931
Holy

313
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:52,249


314
00:03:52,249 --> 00:03:53,567
Spirit,

315
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:54,885
and

316
00:03:54,885 --> 00:03:56,536
putting trust in dead works.

317
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:57,322
24

318
00:03:57,322 --> 00:03:58,108


319
00:03:58,108 --> 00:03:58,894
Behold,

320
00:03:58,894 --> 00:03:59,68
my

321
00:03:59,68 --> 00:04:00,466
son,

322
00:04:00,466 --> 00:04:01,252
this

323
00:04:01,252 --> 00:04:02,038


324
00:04:02,038 --> 00:04:02,824
thing

325
00:04:02,824 --> 00:04:03,61
ought

326
00:04:03,61 --> 00:04:04,396

00:04:07,54 --> 00:04:08,326


332
00:04:08,326 --> 00:04:09,112
repentance is

333
00:04:09,112 --> 00:04:09,898


334
00:04:09,898 --> 00:04:10,684
unto

00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:11,47
them

336
00:04:11,47 --> 00:04:12,256

condemnation

343
00:04:16,972 --> 00:04:17,758
and

344
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:18,825
under the curse of a broken law.

345
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:18,936
25

346
00:04:18,936 --> 00:04:19,047
And
