00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 7 An invitation is given to enter

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
into the rest of the Lord—Pray with real

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
intent—The Spirit of Christ enables men to know good

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
from evil—Satan persuades men to deny Christ

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and do evil—The prophets manifest the coming

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of Christ—By faith, miracles are wrought and

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
angels minister—Men should hope for eternal

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:08:42,
life and cleave unto charity. About A.D. 401–21. 

9
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
1 And now I, Moroni, write a few of the

10
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
words of my father Mormon, which he spake

11
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
concerning faith, hope, and charity; for

12
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
after this manner did he speak unto the

13
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
people, as he taught them in the synagogue

14
00:08:42,0 --> 00:21:50,
which they had built for the place of worship.

15
00:21:50,0 --> 00:21:50,0
2 And now I, Mormon, speak unto you, my

16
00:21:50,0 --> 00:21:50,0
beloved brethren; and it is by the grace

17
00:21:50,0 --> 00:21:50,0
of God the Father, and our Lord Jesus

18
00:21:50,0 --> 00:21:50,0
Christ, and his holy will, because of the

19
00:21:50,0 --> 00:21:50,0
gift of his calling unto me, that I am

20
00:21:50,0 --> 00:25:48,
permitted to speak unto you at this time.

21
00:25:48,0 --> 00:25:48,0
3 Wherefore, I would speak unto you

22
00:25:48,0 --> 00:25:48,0
that are of the church, that are the

23
00:25:48,0 --> 00:25:48,0
peaceable followers of Christ, and

24
00:25:48,0 --> 00:25:48,0
that have obtained a sufficient hope by

25
00:25:48,0 --> 00:25:48,0
which ye can enter into the rest of

26
00:25:48,0 --> 00:25:48,0
the Lord, from this time henceforth

27
00:25:48,0 --> 00:30:59,
until ye shall rest with him in heaven.

28
00:30:59,0 --> 00:30:59,0
4 And now my brethren, I judge

29
00:30:59,0 --> 00:30:59,0
these things of you because of your

30
00:30:59,0 --> 00:33:11,
peaceable walk with the children of men.

31
00:33:11,0 --> 00:33:11,0
5 For I remember the word of God

32
00:33:11,0 --> 00:33:11,0
which saith by their works ye

33
00:33:11,0 --> 00:33:11,0
shall know them; for if their works

34
00:33:11,0 --> 00:36:56,
be good, then they are good also.

35
00:36:56,0 --> 00:36:56,0
6 For behold, God hath said a

36
00:36:56,0 --> 00:36:56,0
man being evil cannot do that

37
00:36:56,0 --> 00:36:56,0
which is good; for if he offereth

38
00:36:56,0 --> 00:36:56,0
a gift, or prayeth unto God,

39
00:36:56,0 --> 00:36:56,0
except he shall do it with real

40
00:36:56,0 --> 00:37:40,
intent it profiteth him nothing.

41
00:37:40,0 --> 00:37:40,0
7 For behold, it is not

42
00:37:40,0 --> 00:45:09,
counted unto him for righteousness.

43
00:45:09,0 --> 00:45:09,0
8 For behold, if a man

44
00:45:09,0 --> 00:45:09,0
being evil giveth a gift, he

45
00:45:09,0 --> 00:45:09,0
doeth it grudgingly;

46
00:45:09,0 --> 00:45:09,0
wherefore it is counted unto

47
00:45:09,0 --> 00:45:09,0
him the same as if he had

48
00:45:09,0 --> 00:45:09,0
retained the gift; wherefore

49
00:45:09,0 --> 00:48:39,
he is counted evil before God.

50
00:48:39,0 --> 00:48:39,0
9 And likewise also is

51
00:48:39,0 --> 00:48:39,0
it counted evil unto a

52
00:48:39,0 --> 00:48:39,0
man, if he shall pray

53
00:48:39,0 --> 00:48:39,0
and not with real intent

54
00:48:39,0 --> 00:48:39,0
of heart; yea, and it

55
00:48:39,0 --> 00:48:39,0
profiteth him nothing,

56
00:48:39,0 --> 00:48:11,
for God receiveth none such.

57
00:48:11,0 --> 00:48:11,0
10 Wherefore, a

58
00:48:11,0 --> 00:48:11,0
man being evil

59
00:48:11,0 --> 00:48:11,0
cannot do that which is

60
00:48:11,0 --> 00:48:11,0
good; neither

61
00:48:11,0 --> 00:51:42,
will he give a good gift.

62
00:51:42,0 --> 00:51:42,0
11 For behold, a

63
00:51:42,0 --> 00:51:42,0
bitter fountain

64
00:51:42,0 --> 00:51:42,0
cannot bring forth

65
00:51:42,0 --> 00:51:42,0
good water;

66
00:51:42,0 --> 00:51:42,0
neither can a good

67
00:51:42,0 --> 00:51:42,0
fountain bring

68
00:51:42,0 --> 00:51:42,0
forth bitter water;

69
00:51:42,0 --> 00:51:42,0
wherefore, a man

70
00:51:42,0 --> 00:51:42,0
being a servant of

71
00:51:42,0 --> 00:51:42,0
the devil cannot

72
00:51:42,0 --> 00:51:42,0
follow Christ;

73
00:51:42,0 --> 00:51:42,0
and if he follow

74
00:51:42,0 --> 00:51:42,0
Christ he cannot

75
00:51:42,0 --> 00:58:50,
be a servant of the devil.

76
00:58:50,0 --> 00:58:50,0
12 Wherefore,

77
00:58:50,0 --> 00:58:50,0
all things which

78
00:58:50,0 --> 00:58:50,0
are good cometh

79
00:58:50,0 --> 00:58:50,0
of God; and that

80
00:58:50,0 --> 00:58:50,0
which is evil

81
00:58:50,0 --> 00:58:50,0
cometh of the

82
00:58:50,0 --> 00:58:50,0
devil; for the devil

83
00:58:50,0 --> 00:58:50,0
is an enemy

84
00:58:50,0 --> 00:58:50,0
unto God, and

85
00:58:50,0 --> 00:58:50,0
fighteth against him

86
00:58:50,0 --> 00:58:50,0
continually, and

87
00:58:50,0 --> 00:58:50,0
inviteth and

88
00:58:50,0 --> 00:58:50,0
enticeth to sin,

89
00:58:50,0 --> 00:58:50,0
and to do that

90
00:58:50,0 --> 01:05:00,
which is evil continually.

91
01:05:00,0 --> 01:05:00,0
13 But behold,

92
01:05:00,0 --> 01:05:00,0
that which is

93
01:05:00,0 --> 01:05:00,0
of God inviteth

94
01:05:00,0 --> 01:05:00,0
and enticeth to

95
01:05:00,0 --> 01:05:00,0
do good

96
01:05:00,0 --> 01:05:00,0
continually;

97
01:05:00,0 --> 01:05:00,0
wherefore, every thing

98
01:05:00,0 --> 01:05:00,0
which inviteth

99
01:05:00,0 --> 01:05:00,0
and enticeth to

100
01:05:00,0 --> 01:05:00,0
do good, and

101
01:05:00,0 --> 01:05:00,0
to love God, and

102
01:05:00,0 --> 01:05:00,0
to serve him,

103
01:05:00,0 --> 01:08:30,
is inspired of God.

104
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
14 Wherefore,

105
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
take heed,

106
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
my beloved

107
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
brethren, that

108
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
ye do not

109
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
judge that which

110
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
is evil to be

111
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
of God, or

112
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
that which is

113
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
good and of

114
01:08:30,0 --> 01:16:13,
God to be of the devil.

115
01:16:13,0 --> 01:16:13,0
15 For

116
01:16:13,0 --> 01:16:13,0
behold, my

117
01:16:13,0 --> 01:16:13,0
brethren, it is given

118
01:16:13,0 --> 01:16:13,0
unto you to

119
01:16:13,0 --> 01:16:13,0
judge, that

120
01:16:13,0 --> 01:16:13,0
ye may know

121
01:16:13,0 --> 01:16:13,0
good from evil;

122
01:16:13,0 --> 01:16:13,0
and the way

123
01:16:13,0 --> 01:16:13,0
to judge is

124
01:16:13,0 --> 01:16:13,0
as plain, that

125
01:16:13,0 --> 01:16:13,0
ye may know

126
01:16:13,0 --> 01:16:13,0
with a

127
01:16:13,0 --> 01:16:13,0
perfect knowledge,

128
01:16:13,0 --> 01:16:13,0
as the

129
01:16:13,0 --> 01:16:13,0
daylight is from

130
01:16:13,0 --> 01:19:44,
the dark night.

131
01:19:44,0 --> 01:19:44,0
16 For

132
01:19:44,0 --> 01:19:44,0
behold, the Spirit

133
01:19:44,0 --> 01:19:44,0
of Christ is

134
01:19:44,0 --> 01:19:44,0
given to

135
01:19:44,0 --> 01:19:44,0
every man, that

136
01:19:44,0 --> 01:19:44,0
he may know

137
01:19:44,0 --> 01:19:44,0
good from evil;

138
01:19:44,0 --> 01:19:44,0
wherefore, I

139
01:19:44,0 --> 01:19:44,0
show unto

140
01:19:44,0 --> 01:19:44,0
you the way to

141
01:19:44,0 --> 01:19:44,0
judge; for

142
01:19:44,0 --> 01:19:44,0
every thing

143
01:19:44,0 --> 01:19:44,0
which inviteth

144
01:19:44,0 --> 01:19:44,0
to do good,

145
01:19:44,0 --> 01:19:44,0
and to persuade

146
01:19:44,0 --> 01:19:44,0
to believe

147
01:19:44,0 --> 01:19:44,0
in Christ, is

148
01:19:44,0 --> 01:19:44,0
sent forth by

149
01:19:44,0 --> 01:19:44,0
the power

150
01:19:44,0 --> 01:19:44,0
and gift of

151
01:19:44,0 --> 01:19:44,0
Christ;

152
01:19:44,0 --> 01:19:44,0
wherefore ye may know

153
01:19:44,0 --> 01:19:44,0
with a

154
01:19:44,0 --> 01:19:44,0
perfect knowledge

155
01:19:44,0 --> 01:19:16,
it is of God.

156
01:19:16,0 --> 01:19:16,0
17 But

157
01:19:16,0 --> 01:19:16,0
whatsoever thing

158
01:19:16,0 --> 01:19:16,0
persuadeth

159
01:19:16,0 --> 01:19:16,0
men to do

160
01:19:16,0 --> 01:19:16,0
evil, and

161
01:19:16,0 --> 01:19:16,0
believe not in

162
01:19:16,0 --> 01:19:16,0
Christ, and

163
01:19:16,0 --> 01:19:16,0
deny him, and

164
01:19:16,0 --> 01:19:16,0
serve not

165
01:19:16,0 --> 01:19:16,0
God, then ye

166
01:19:16,0 --> 01:19:16,0
may know with

167
01:19:16,0 --> 01:19:16,0
a perfect

168
01:19:16,0 --> 01:19:16,0
knowledge it

169
01:19:16,0 --> 01:19:16,0
is of the

170
01:19:16,0 --> 01:19:16,0
devil; for

171
01:19:16,0 --> 01:19:16,0
after this

172
01:19:16,0 --> 01:19:16,0
manner doth the

173
01:19:16,0 --> 01:19:16,0
devil work,

174
01:19:16,0 --> 01:19:16,0
for he

175
01:19:16,0 --> 01:19:16,0
persuadeth no man

176
01:19:16,0 --> 01:19:16,0
to do good,

177
01:19:16,0 --> 01:19:16,0
no, not

178
01:19:16,0 --> 01:19:16,0
one; neither do

179
01:19:16,0 --> 01:19:16,0
his angels;

180
01:19:16,0 --> 01:19:16,0
neither do

181
01:19:16,0 --> 01:18:48,
they who subject themselves unto him.

182
01:18:48,0 --> 01:18:48,0
18 And now,

183
01:18:48,0 --> 01:18:48,0
my

184
01:18:48,0 --> 01:18:48,0
brethren, seeing

185
01:18:48,0 --> 01:18:48,0
that ye know

186
01:18:48,0 --> 01:18:48,0
the light

187
01:18:48,0 --> 01:18:48,0
by which ye

188
01:18:48,0 --> 01:18:48,0
may judge,

189
01:18:48,0 --> 01:18:48,0
which

190
01:18:48,0 --> 01:18:48,0
light is the

191
01:18:48,0 --> 01:18:48,0
light of

192
01:18:48,0 --> 01:18:48,0
Christ, see

193
01:18:48,0 --> 01:18:48,0
that ye do not

194
01:18:48,0 --> 01:18:48,0
judge

195
01:18:48,0 --> 01:18:48,0
wrongfully; for

196
01:18:48,0 --> 01:18:48,0
with that

197
01:18:48,0 --> 01:18:48,0
same

198
01:18:48,0 --> 01:18:48,0
judgment which ye

199
01:18:48,0 --> 01:18:48,0
judge ye

200
01:18:48,0 --> 01:18:20,
shall also be judged.

201
01:18:20,0 --> 01:18:20,0
19

202
01:18:20,0 --> 01:18:20,0
Wherefore, I

203
01:18:20,0 --> 01:18:20,0
beseech of

204
01:18:20,0 --> 01:18:20,0
you,

205
01:18:20,0 --> 01:18:20,0
brethren, that ye

206
01:18:20,0 --> 01:18:20,0
should

207
01:18:20,0 --> 01:18:20,0
search

208
01:18:20,0 --> 01:18:20,0
diligently in

209
01:18:20,0 --> 01:18:20,0
the light of

210
01:18:20,0 --> 01:18:20,0
Christ

211
01:18:20,0 --> 01:18:20,0
that ye may

212
01:18:20,0 --> 01:18:20,0
know good

213
01:18:20,0 --> 01:18:20,0
from evil;

214
01:18:20,0 --> 01:18:20,0
and if ye

215
01:18:20,0 --> 01:18:20,0
will lay

216
01:18:20,0 --> 01:18:20,0
hold upon

217
01:18:20,0 --> 01:18:20,0
every good

218
01:18:20,0 --> 01:18:20,0
thing,

219
01:18:20,0 --> 01:18:20,0
and condemn

220
01:18:20,0 --> 01:18:20,0
it not, ye

221
01:18:20,0 --> 01:18:20,0

48 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ; that ye may become the sons of God; that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; that we may have this hope; that we may be purified even as he is pure. Amen.
