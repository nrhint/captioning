00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:08,375
Chapter 7 An invitation is given to enter into the

2
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:16,75
 rest of the Lord—Pray with real intent—The Spirit

3
00:00:16,75 --> 00:00:25,125
 of Christ enables men to know good from

4
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:33,5
 evil—Satan persuades men to deny Christ and do evil—The

5
00:00:33,5 --> 00:00:41,875
 prophets manifest the coming of Christ—By faith,

6
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:50,25
 miracles are wrought and angels minister—Men should

7
00:00:50,25 --> 00:00:58,625
 hope for eternal life and cleave unto charity. About

 A.D. 401–21.

9
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:13,334
1 And now I, Moroni, write a few of the words of

10
00:01:13,334 --> 00:01:19,334
 my father Mormon, which he spake concerning faith,

11
00:01:19,334 --> 00:01:25,334
 hope, and charity; for after this manner did he

12
00:01:25,334 --> 00:01:31,334
 speak unto the people, as he taught them in the

13
00:01:31,334 --> 00:01:37,334
 synagogue which they had built for the place of

14
00:01:37,334 --> 00:01:43,334
 worship

15
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:49,537
2 And now I, Mormon, speak unto you, my beloved

16
00:01:49,537 --> 00:01:55,337
 brethren; and it is by the grace of God the Father,

17
00:01:55,337 --> 00:02:01,137
 and our Lord Jesus Christ, and his holy will,

18
00:02:01,137 --> 00:02:06,937
 because of the gift of his calling unto me, that I am

19
00:02:06,937 --> 00:02:12,737
 permitted to speak unto you at this time

20
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:17,065
3 Wherefore, I would speak unto you that are of

21
00:02:17,065 --> 00:02:21,898
 the church, that are the peaceable followers of

22
00:02:21,898 --> 00:02:26,731
 Christ, and that have obtained a sufficient hope by

23
00:02:26,731 --> 00:02:31,564
 which ye can enter into the rest of the Lord, from

24
00:02:31,564 --> 00:02:36,397
 this time henceforth until ye shall rest with him

25
00:02:36,397 --> 00:02:41,23
 in heaven

26
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:46,061
4 And now my brethren, I judge these things of you

27
00:02:46,061 --> 00:02:51,061
 because of your peaceable walk with the children

28
00:02:51,061 --> 00:02:56,061
 of men

29
00:02:56,309 --> 00:03:02,642
5 For I remember the word of God which saith by

30
00:03:02,642 --> 00:03:08,975
 their works ye shall know them; for if their works

31
00:03:08,975 --> 00:03:15,308
 be good, then they are good also

32
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:22,562
6 For behold, God hath said a man being evil

33
00:03:22,562 --> 00:03:29,562
 cannot do that which is good; for if he offereth a

34
00:03:29,562 --> 00:03:36,562
 gift, or prayeth unto God, except he shall do it with

35
00:03:36,562 --> 00:03:43,562
 real intent it profiteth him nothing

36
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:47,823
7 For behold, it is not counted unto him for

37
00:03:47,823 --> 00:03:52,323
 righteousness

38
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:58,765
8 For behold, if a man being evil giveth a gift,

39
00:03:58,765 --> 00:04:05,265
 he doeth it grudgingly; wherefore it is counted

40
00:04:05,265 --> 00:04:11,765
 unto him the same as if he had retained the gift;

41
00:04:11,765 --> 00:04:18,265
 wherefore he is counted evil before God

42
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:25,042
9 And likewise also is it counted evil unto a man,

43
00:04:25,042 --> 00:04:31,292
 if he shall pray and not with real intent of

44
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:37,542
 heart; yea, and it profiteth him nothing, for God

45
00:04:37,542 --> 00:04:43,792
 receiveth none such

46
00:04:43,55 --> 00:04:51,05
10 Wherefore, a man being evil cannot do that

47
00:04:51,05 --> 00:04:58,55
 which is good; neither will he give a good gift

48
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:05,464
11 For behold, a bitter fountain cannot bring

49
00:05:05,464 --> 00:05:12,864
 forth good water; neither can a good fountain bring

50
00:05:12,864 --> 00:05:20,264
 forth bitter water; wherefore, a man being a servant

51
00:05:20,264 --> 00:05:27,664
 of the devil cannot follow Christ; and if he

52
00:05:27,664 --> 00:05:35,064
 follow Christ he cannot be a servant of the devil

53
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:42,369
12 Wherefore, all things which are good cometh of

54
00:05:42,369 --> 00:05:48,769
 God; and that which is evil cometh of the devil;

55
00:05:48,769 --> 00:05:55,169
 for the devil is an enemy unto God, and fighteth

56
00:05:55,169 --> 00:06:01,569
 against him continually, and inviteth and enticeth

57
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:07,969
 to sin, and to do that which is evil continually

58
00:06:07,4 --> 00:06:14,4
13 But behold, that which is of God inviteth and

59
00:06:14,4 --> 00:06:21,4
 enticeth to do good continually; wherefore, every

60
00:06:21,4 --> 00:06:28,4
 thing which inviteth and enticeth to do good, and

61
00:06:28,4 --> 00:06:35,4
 to love God, and to serve him, is inspired of God

62
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:40,095
14 Wherefore, take heed, my beloved brethren, that

63
00:06:40,095 --> 00:06:45,095
 ye do not judge that which is evil to be of God,

64
00:06:45,095 --> 00:06:50,095
 or that which is good and of God to be of the

65
00:06:50,095 --> 00:06:55,095
 devil

66
00:06:55,382 --> 00:07:01,582
15 For behold, my brethren, it is given unto you

67
00:07:01,582 --> 00:07:07,782
 to judge, that ye may know good from evil; and the

68
00:07:07,782 --> 00:07:13,982
 way to judge is as plain, that ye may know with a

69
00:07:13,982 --> 00:07:20,182
 perfect knowledge, as the daylight is from the

70
00:07:20,182 --> 00:07:26,382
 dark night

71
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:32,222
16 For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to

72
00:07:32,222 --> 00:07:38,365
 every man, that he may know good from evil;

73
00:07:38,365 --> 00:07:44,508
 wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge; for every

74
00:07:44,508 --> 00:07:50,651
 thing which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to

75
00:07:50,651 --> 00:07:56,794
 believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and

76
00:07:56,794 --> 00:08:02,937
 gift of Christ; wherefore ye may know with a

77
00:08:02,937 --> 00:08:09,08
 perfect knowledge it is of God

78
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:16,956
17 But whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do evil,

79
00:08:16,956 --> 00:08:23,956
 and believe not in Christ, and deny him, and

80
00:08:23,956 --> 00:08:30,956
 serve not God, then ye may know with a perfect

81
00:08:30,956 --> 00:08:37,956
 knowledge it is of the devil; for after this manner doth

82
00:08:37,956 --> 00:08:44,956
 the devil work, for he persuadeth no man to do

83
00:08:44,956 --> 00:08:51,956
 good, no, not one; neither do his angels; neither do

84
00:08:51,956 --> 00:08:58,956
 they who subject themselves unto him

85
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:04,404
18 And now, my brethren, seeing that ye know the

86
00:09:04,404 --> 00:09:10,604
 light by which ye may judge, which light is the

87
00:09:10,604 --> 00:09:16,804
 light of Christ, see that ye do not judge wrongfully;

88
00:09:16,804 --> 00:09:23,004
 for with that same judgment which ye judge ye

89
00:09:23,004 --> 00:09:29,204
 shall also be judged

90
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:35,935
19 Wherefore, I beseech of you, brethren, that ye

91
00:09:35,935 --> 00:09:42,735
 should search diligently in the light of Christ

92
00:09:42,735 --> 00:09:49,535
 that ye may know good from evil; and if ye will lay

93
00:09:49,535 --> 00:09:56,335
 hold upon every good thing, and condemn it not, ye

94
00:09:56,335 --> 00:10:03,135
 certainly will be a child of Christ

95
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:09,069
20 And now, my brethren, how is it possible that

96
00:10:09,069 --> 00:10:15,069
 ye can lay hold upon every good thing

97
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:21,714
21 And now I come to that faith, of which I said I

98
00:10:21,714 --> 00:10:28,047
 would speak; and I will tell you the way whereby

99
00:10:28,047 --> 00:10:34,38
 ye may lay hold on every good thing

100
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:41,668
22 For behold, God knowing all things, being from

101
00:10:41,668 --> 00:10:48,468
 everlasting to everlasting, behold, he sent angels

102
00:10:48,468 --> 00:10:55,268
 to minister unto the children of men, to make

103
00:10:55,268 --> 00:11:02,068
 manifest concerning the coming of Christ; and in

104
00:11:02,068 --> 00:11:08,868
 Christ there should come every good thing

105
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:14,601
23 And God also declared unto prophets, by his own

106
00:11:14,601 --> 00:11:20,601
 mouth, that Christ should come

107
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:26,714
24 And behold, there were divers ways that he did

108
00:11:26,714 --> 00:11:32,514
 manifest things unto the children of men, which

109
00:11:32,514 --> 00:11:38,314
 were good; and all things which are good cometh of

110
00:11:38,314 --> 00:11:44,114
 Christ; otherwise men were fallen, and there could

111
00:11:44,114 --> 00:11:49,914
 no good thing come unto them

112
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:55,242
25 Wherefore, by the ministering of angels, and by

113
00:11:55,242 --> 00:12:01,075
 every word which proceeded forth out of the mouth

114
00:12:01,075 --> 00:12:06,908
 of God, men began to exercise faith in Christ;

115
00:12:06,908 --> 00:12:12,741
 and thus by faith, they did lay hold upon every good

116
00:12:12,741 --> 00:12:18,574
 thing; and thus it was until the coming of

117
00:12:18,574 --> 00:12:24,407
 Christ

118
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:31,273
26 And after that he came men also were saved by

119
00:12:31,273 --> 00:12:37,702
 faith in his name; and by faith, they become the

120
00:12:37,702 --> 00:12:44,131
 sons of God. And as surely as Christ liveth he spake

121
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:50,56
 these words unto our fathers, saying: Whatsoever

122
00:12:50,56 --> 00:12:56,989
 thing ye shall ask the Father in my name, which is

123
00:12:56,989 --> 00:13:03,418
 good, in faith believing that ye shall receive,

124
00:13:03,418 --> 00:13:09,847
 behold, it shall be done unto you

125
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:15,522
27 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, have miracles

126
00:13:15,522 --> 00:13:21,722
 ceased because Christ hath ascended into heaven,

127
00:13:21,722 --> 00:13:27,922
 and hath sat down on the right hand of God, to claim

128
00:13:27,922 --> 00:13:34,122
 of the Father his rights of mercy which he hath

129
00:13:34,122 --> 00:13:40,322
 upon the children of men

130
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:46,92
28 For he hath answered the ends of the law, and

131
00:13:46,92 --> 00:13:53,087
 he claimeth all those who have faith in him; and

132
00:13:53,087 --> 00:13:59,254
 they who have faith in him will cleave unto every

133
00:13:59,254 --> 00:14:05,421
 good thing; wherefore he advocateth the cause of the

134
00:14:05,421 --> 00:14:11,588
 children of men; and he dwelleth eternally in the

135
00:14:11,588 --> 00:14:17,755
 heavens

136
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:23,756
29 And because he hath done this, my beloved

137
00:14:23,756 --> 00:14:30,256
 brethren, have miracles ceased? Behold I say unto you,

138
00:14:30,256 --> 00:14:36,756
 Nay; neither have angels ceased to minister unto

139
00:14:36,756 --> 00:14:43,256
 the children of men

140
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:49,466
30 For behold, they are subject unto him, to

141
00:14:49,466 --> 00:14:55,716
 minister according to the word of his command, showing

142
00:14:55,716 --> 00:15:01,966
 themselves unto them of strong faith and a firm

143
00:15:01,966 --> 00:15:08,216
 mind in every form of godliness

144
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:15,512
31 And the office of their ministry is to call men

145
00:15:15,512 --> 00:15:22,083
 unto repentance, and to fulfil and to do the work

146
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:28,654
 of the covenants of the Father, which he hath

147
00:15:28,654 --> 00:15:35,225
 made unto the children of men, to prepare the way

148
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:41,796
 among the children of men, by declaring the word of

149
00:15:41,796 --> 00:15:48,367
 Christ unto the chosen vessels of the Lord, that

150
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:54,938
 they may bear testimony of him

151
00:15:54,387 --> 00:16:00,387
32 And by so doing, the Lord God prepareth the way

152
00:16:00,387 --> 00:16:06,387
 that the residue of men may have faith in Christ,

153
00:16:06,387 --> 00:16:12,387
 that the Holy Ghost may have place in their

154
00:16:12,387 --> 00:16:18,387
 hearts, according to the power thereof; and after this

155
00:16:18,387 --> 00:16:24,387
 manner bringeth to pass the Father, the covenants

156
00:16:24,387 --> 00:16:30,387
 which he hath made unto the children of men

157
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:36,857
33 And Christ hath said: If ye will have faith in

158
00:16:36,857 --> 00:16:42,857
 me ye shall have power to do whatsoever thing is

159
00:16:42,857 --> 00:16:48,857
 expedient in me

160
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:55,374
34 And he hath said: Repent all ye ends of the

161
00:16:55,374 --> 00:17:02,374
 earth, and come unto me, and be baptized in my name,

162
00:17:02,374 --> 00:17:09,374
 and have faith in me, that ye may be saved

163
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:14,362
35 And now, my beloved brethren, if this be the

164
00:17:14,362 --> 00:17:19,529
 case that these things are true which I have spoken

165
00:17:19,529 --> 00:17:24,696
 unto you, and God will show unto you, with power

166
00:17:24,696 --> 00:17:29,863
 and great glory at the last day, that they are

167
00:17:29,863 --> 00:17:35,03
 true, and if they are true has the day of miracles

168
00:17:35,03 --> 00:17:40,197
 ceased

169
00:17:40,86 --> 00:17:47,46
36 Or have angels ceased to appear unto the

170
00:17:47,46 --> 00:17:54,06
 children of men? Or has he withheld the power of the

171
00:17:54,06 --> 00:18:00,66
 Holy Ghost from them? Or will he, so long as time

172
00:18:00,66 --> 00:18:07,26
 shall last, or the earth shall stand, or there shall

173
00:18:07,26 --> 00:18:13,86
 be one man upon the face thereof to be saved

174
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:20,493
37 Behold I say unto you, Nay; for it is by faith

175
00:18:20,493 --> 00:18:27,16
 that miracles are wrought; and it is by faith that

176
00:18:27,16 --> 00:18:33,827
 angels appear and minister unto men; wherefore,

177
00:18:33,827 --> 00:18:40,494
 if these things have ceased wo be unto the children

178
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:47,161
 of men, for it is because of unbelief, and all is

179
00:18:47,161 --> 00:18:53,828
 vain

180
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:59,499
38 For no man can be saved, according to the words

181
00:18:59,499 --> 00:19:05,666
 of Christ, save they shall have faith in his

182
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:11,833
 name; wherefore, if these things have ceased, then has

183
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:18,0
 faith ceased also; and awful is the state of man,

184
00:19:18,0 --> 00:19:24,167
 for they are as though there had been no

185
00:19:24,167 --> 00:19:30,334
 redemption made

186
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:37,236
39 But behold, my beloved brethren, I judge better

187
00:19:37,236 --> 00:19:43,636
 things of you, for I judge that ye have faith in

188
00:19:43,636 --> 00:19:50,036
 Christ because of your meekness; for if ye have

189
00:19:50,036 --> 00:19:56,436
 not faith in him then ye are not fit to be numbered

190
00:19:56,436 --> 00:20:02,836
 among the people of his church

191
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:09,268
40 And again, my beloved brethren, I would speak

192
00:20:09,268 --> 00:20:16,268
 unto you concerning hope. How is it that ye can

193
00:20:16,268 --> 00:20:23,268
 attain unto faith, save ye shall have hope

194
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:28,855
41 And what is it that ye shall hope for? Behold I

195
00:20:28,855 --> 00:20:34,188
 say unto you that ye shall have hope through the

196
00:20:34,188 --> 00:20:39,521
 atonement of Christ and the power of his

197
00:20:39,521 --> 00:20:44,854
 resurrection, to be raised unto life eternal, and this

198
00:20:44,854 --> 00:20:50,187
 because of your faith in him according to the promise

199
00:20:50,187 --> 00:20:55,52


200
00:20:55,421 --> 00:21:01,421
42 Wherefore, if a man have faith he must needs

201
00:21:01,421 --> 00:21:07,421
 have hope; for without faith there cannot be any

202
00:21:07,421 --> 00:21:13,421
 hope

203
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:19,939
43 And again, behold I say unto you that he cannot

204
00:21:19,939 --> 00:21:25,939
 have faith and hope, save he shall be meek, and

205
00:21:25,939 --> 00:21:31,939
 lowly of heart

206
00:21:31,257 --> 00:21:38,828
44 If so, his faith and hope is vain, for none is

207
00:21:38,828 --> 00:21:46,399
 acceptable before God, save the meek and lowly in

208
00:21:46,399 --> 00:21:53,97
 heart; and if a man be meek and lowly in heart,

209
00:21:53,97 --> 00:22:01,541
 and confesses by the power of the Holy Ghost that

210
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:09,112
 Jesus is the Christ, he must needs have charity; for

211
00:22:09,112 --> 00:22:16,683
 if he have not charity he is nothing; wherefore

212
00:22:16,683 --> 00:22:24,254
 he must needs have charity

213
00:22:24,41 --> 00:22:32,41
45 And charity suffereth long, and is kind, and

214
00:22:32,41 --> 00:22:40,41
 envieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her

215
00:22:40,41 --> 00:22:48,41
 own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, and

216
00:22:48,41 --> 00:22:56,41
 rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the

217
00:22:56,41 --> 00:23:04,41
 truth, beareth all things, believeth all things,

218
00:23:04,41 --> 00:23:12,41
 hopeth all things, endureth all things

219
00:23:12,258 --> 00:23:21,258
46 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, if ye have not

220
00:23:21,258 --> 00:23:30,258
 charity, ye are nothing, for charity never

221
00:23:30,258 --> 00:23:39,258
 faileth. Wherefore, cleave unto charity, which is the

222
00:23:39,258 --> 00:23:48,258
 greatest of all, for all things must fail

223
00:23:48,494 --> 00:23:55,161
47 But charity is the pure love of Christ, and it

224
00:23:55,161 --> 00:24:01,828
 endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of

225
00:24:01,828 --> 00:24:08,495
 it at the last day, it shall be well with him

226
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:15,514
48 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the

227
00:24:15,514 --> 00:24:22,514
 Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be

228
00:24:22,514 --> 00:24:29,514
 filled with this love, which he hath bestowed

229
00:24:29,514 --> 00:24:36,514
 upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus

230
00:24:36,514 --> 00:24:43,514
 Christ; that ye may become the sons of God; that when

231
00:24:43,514 --> 00:24:50,514
 he shall appear we shall be like him, for we

232
00:24:50,514 --> 00:24:57,514
 shall see him as he is; that we may have this hope;

233
00:24:57,514 --> 00:25:04,514
 that we may be purified even as he is pure. Amen.
