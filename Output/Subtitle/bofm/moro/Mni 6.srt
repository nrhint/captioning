Chapter 6 Repentant persons are baptized and

2
00:00:08,25 --> 00:00:16,5
 fellowshipped—Church members who repent are

3
00:00:16,5 --> 00:00:24,75
 forgiven—Meetings are conducted by the power of the Holy

4
00:00:24,75 --> 00:00:33,0
 Ghost. About A.D. 401–21.

5
00:00:33,7 --> 00:00:39,95
1 And now I speak concerning baptism. Behold,

6
00:00:39,95 --> 00:00:46,2
 elders, priests, and teachers were baptized; and they

7
00:00:46,2 --> 00:00:52,45
 were not baptized save they brought forth fruit

8
00:00:52,45 --> 00:00:58,7
 meet that they were worthy of it

9
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:04,959
2 Neither did they receive any unto baptism save

10
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:10,959
 they came forth with a broken heart and a contrite

11
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:16,959
 spirit, and witnessed unto the church that they

12
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:22,959
 truly repented of all their sins

13
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:28,115
3 And none were received unto baptism save they

14
00:01:28,115 --> 00:01:34,115
 took upon them the name of Christ, having a

15
00:01:34,115 --> 00:01:40,115
 determination to serve him to the end

16
00:01:40,1 --> 00:01:46,322
4 And after they had been received unto baptism,

17
00:01:46,322 --> 00:01:52,544
 and were wrought upon and cleansed by the power of

18
00:01:52,544 --> 00:01:58,766
 the Holy Ghost, they were numbered among the

19
00:01:58,766 --> 00:02:04,988
 people of the church of Christ; and their names were

20
00:02:04,988 --> 00:02:11,21
 taken, that they might be remembered and nourished

21
00:02:11,21 --> 00:02:17,432
 by the good word of God, to keep them in the right

22
00:02:17,432 --> 00:02:23,654
 way, to keep them continually watchful unto

23
00:02:23,654 --> 00:02:29,876
 prayer, relying alone upon the merits of Christ, who was

24
00:02:29,876 --> 00:02:36,098
 the author and the finisher of their faith

25
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:43,523
5 And the church did meet together oft, to fast

26
00:02:43,523 --> 00:02:50,523
 and to pray, and to speak one with another

27
00:02:50,523 --> 00:02:57,523
 concerning the welfare of their souls

28
00:02:57,244 --> 00:03:01,744
6 And they did meet together oft to partake of

29
00:03:01,744 --> 00:03:06,244
 bread and wine, in remembrance of the Lord Jesus

30
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:40,706
9 And their meetings were conducted by the church

31
00:00:40,706 --> 00:00:41,539
 after the manner of the workings of the Spirit,

32
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:42,372
 and by the power of the Holy Ghost; for as the power

33
00:00:42,372 --> 00:00:43,205
 of the Holy Ghost led them whether to preach, or

34
00:00:43,205 --> 00:00:44,038
 to exhort, or to pray, or to supplicate, or to

35
00:00:44,038 --> 00:00:44,871
 sing, even so it was done.
