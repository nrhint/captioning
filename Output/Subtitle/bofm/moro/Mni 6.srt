00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 6 Repentant persons are baptized

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and fellowshipped—Church members who repent

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
are forgiven—Meetings are conducted by the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:04:13,
power of the Holy Ghost. About A.D. 401–21. 

5
00:04:13,0 --> 00:04:13,0
1 And now I speak concerning

6
00:04:13,0 --> 00:04:13,0
baptism. Behold, elders, priests, and

7
00:04:13,0 --> 00:04:13,0
teachers were baptized; and they were not

8
00:04:13,0 --> 00:04:13,0
baptized save they brought forth

9
00:04:13,0 --> 00:04:27,
fruit meet that they were worthy of it.

10
00:04:27,0 --> 00:04:27,0
2 Neither did they receive any

11
00:04:27,0 --> 00:04:27,0
unto baptism save they came

12
00:04:27,0 --> 00:04:27,0
forth with a broken heart and a

13
00:04:27,0 --> 00:04:27,0
contrite spirit, and

14
00:04:27,0 --> 00:04:27,0
witnessed unto the church that they

15
00:04:27,0 --> 00:09:37,
truly repented of all their sins.

16
00:09:37,0 --> 00:09:37,0
3 And none were received

17
00:09:37,0 --> 00:09:37,0
unto baptism save they took

18
00:09:37,0 --> 00:09:37,0
upon them the name of

19
00:09:37,0 --> 00:09:37,0
Christ, having a

20
00:09:37,0 --> 00:13:50,
determination to serve him to the end.

21
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
4 And after they had

22
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
been received unto baptism,

23
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
and were wrought upon

24
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
and cleansed by the power

25
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
of the Holy Ghost, they

26
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
were numbered among the

27
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
people of the church of

28
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
Christ; and their names

29
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
were taken, that they

30
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
might be remembered and

31
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
nourished by the good

32
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
word of God, to keep them

33
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
in the right way, to keep

34
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
them continually

35
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
watchful unto prayer, relying

36
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
alone upon the merits of

37
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
Christ, who was the

38
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,
author and the finisher of their faith.

39
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
5 And the church did

40
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
meet together oft, to

41
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
fast and to pray,

42
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
and to speak one with

43
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
another concerning the

44
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,
welfare of their souls.

45
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
6 And they did meet

46
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
together oft to

47
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
partake of bread and

48
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
wine, in

49
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,
remembrance of the Lord Jesus.

50
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
7 And they were

51
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
strict to observe

52
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
that there should be

53
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
no iniquity among

54
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
them; and whoso

55
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
was found to commit

56
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
iniquity, and

57
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
three witnesses of

58
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
the church did

59
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
condemn them before the

60
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
elders, and if

61
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
they repented not,

62
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
and confessed not,

63
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
their names were

64
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
blotted out, and

65
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
they were not

66
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,
numbered among the people of Christ.

67
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
8 But as oft as

68
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
they repented

69
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
and sought

70
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
forgiveness, with

71
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
real intent,

72
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,
they were forgiven.

73
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
9 And their

74
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
meetings were

75
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
conducted by the

76
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
church after

77
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
the manner of

78
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
the workings

79
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
of the Spirit,

80
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
and by the

81
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
power of the Holy

82
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
Ghost; for as

83
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
the power of

84
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
the Holy Ghost

85
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
led them

86
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
whether to preach,

87
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
or to exhort,

88
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
or to pray,

89
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
or to

90
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,0
supplicate, or to sing,

91
00:13:50,0 --> 00:13:50,
even so it was done.
