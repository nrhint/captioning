00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:07,5
Chapter 6 Repentant persons are baptized

2
00:00:07,5 --> 00:00:15,0
and fellowshipped—Church members who repent

3
00:00:15,0 --> 00:00:22,5
are forgiven—Meetings are conducted by the

4
00:00:22,5 --> 00:00:30,964
power of the Holy Ghost. About A.D. 401–21. 

5
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:30,964
1 And now I speak concerning

6
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:30,964
baptism. Behold, elders, priests, and

7
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:30,964
teachers were baptized; and they were not

8
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:30,964
baptized save they brought forth

9
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:30,03
fruit meet that they were worthy of it.

10
00:00:30,03 --> 00:00:30,363
2 Neither did they receive any

11
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:30,696
unto baptism save they came

12
00:00:30,696 --> 00:00:31,029
forth with a broken heart and a

13
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:31,362
contrite spirit, and

14
00:00:31,362 --> 00:00:31,695
witnessed unto the church that they

15
00:00:31,695 --> 00:00:32,432
truly repented of all their sins.

16
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:34,632
3 And none were received

17
00:00:34,632 --> 00:00:36,832
unto baptism save they took

18
00:00:36,832 --> 00:00:39,032
upon them the name of

19
00:00:39,032 --> 00:00:41,232
Christ, having a

20
00:00:41,232 --> 00:00:43,844
determination to serve him to the end.

21
00:00:43,844 --> 00:00:44,4
4 And after they had

22
00:00:44,4 --> 00:00:44,956
been received unto baptism,

23
00:00:44,956 --> 00:00:45,512
and were wrought upon

24
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:46,068
and cleansed by the power

25
00:00:46,068 --> 00:00:46,624
of the Holy Ghost, they

26
00:00:46,624 --> 00:00:47,18
were numbered among the

27
00:00:47,18 --> 00:00:47,736
people of the church of

28
00:00:47,736 --> 00:00:48,292
Christ; and their names

29
00:00:48,292 --> 00:00:48,848
were taken, that they

30
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:49,404
might be remembered and

31
00:00:49,404 --> 00:00:49,96
nourished by the good

32
00:00:49,96 --> 00:00:50,516
word of God, to keep them

33
00:00:50,516 --> 00:00:51,072
in the right way, to keep

34
00:00:51,072 --> 00:00:51,628
them continually

35
00:00:51,628 --> 00:00:52,184
watchful unto prayer, relying

36
00:00:52,184 --> 00:00:52,74
alone upon the merits of

37
00:00:52,74 --> 00:00:53,296
Christ, who was the

38
00:00:53,296 --> 00:00:53,287
author and the finisher of their faith.

39
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:53,954
5 And the church did

40
00:00:53,954 --> 00:00:54,621
meet together oft, to

41
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:55,288
fast and to pray,

42
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:55,955
and to speak one with

43
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:56,622
another concerning the

44
00:00:56,622 --> 00:00:57,691
welfare of their souls.

45
00:00:57,691 --> 00:01:02,291
6 And they did meet

46
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:06,891
together oft to

47
00:01:06,891 --> 00:01:11,491
partake of bread and

48
00:01:11,491 --> 00:01:16,091
wine, in

49
00:01:16,091 --> 00:01:20,681
remembrance of the Lord Jesus.

50
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:21,328
7 And they were

51
00:01:21,328 --> 00:01:21,975
strict to observe

52
00:01:21,975 --> 00:01:22,622
that there should be

53
00:01:22,622 --> 00:01:23,269
no iniquity among

54
00:01:23,269 --> 00:01:23,916
them; and whoso

55
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:24,563
was found to commit

56
00:01:24,563 --> 00:01:25,21
iniquity, and

57
00:01:25,21 --> 00:01:25,857
three witnesses of

58
00:01:25,857 --> 00:01:26,504
the church did

59
00:01:26,504 --> 00:01:27,151
condemn them before the

60
00:01:27,151 --> 00:01:27,798
elders, and if

61
00:01:27,798 --> 00:01:28,445
they repented not,

62
00:01:28,445 --> 00:01:29,092
and confessed not,

63
00:01:29,092 --> 00:01:29,739
their names were

64
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:30,386
blotted out, and

65
00:01:30,386 --> 00:01:31,033
they were not

66
00:01:31,033 --> 00:01:31,024
numbered among the people of Christ.

67
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:31,691
8 But as oft as

68
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:32,358
they repented

69
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:33,025
and sought

70
00:01:33,025 --> 00:01:33,692
forgiveness, with

71
00:01:33,692 --> 00:01:34,359
real intent,

72
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:35,429
they were forgiven.

73
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:36,061
9 And their

74
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:36,693
meetings were

75
00:01:36,693 --> 00:01:37,325
conducted by the

76
00:01:37,325 --> 00:01:37,957
church after

77
00:01:37,957 --> 00:01:38,589
the manner of

78
00:01:38,589 --> 00:01:39,221
the workings

79
00:01:39,221 --> 00:01:39,853
of the Spirit,

80
00:01:39,853 --> 00:01:40,485
and by the

81
00:01:40,485 --> 00:01:41,117
power of the Holy

82
00:01:41,117 --> 00:01:41,749
Ghost; for as

83
00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:42,381
the power of

84
00:01:42,381 --> 00:01:43,013
the Holy Ghost

85
00:01:43,013 --> 00:01:43,645
led them

86
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:44,277
whether to preach,

87
00:01:44,277 --> 00:01:44,909
or to exhort,

88
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:45,541
or to pray,

89
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:46,173
or to

90
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:46,805
supplicate, or to sing,

91
00:01:46,805 --> 00:01:47,774
even so it was done.
