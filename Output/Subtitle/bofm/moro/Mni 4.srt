Chapter 4 How elders and priests administer the

2
00:00:10,5 --> 00:00:21,321
sacramental bread is explained. About A.D. 401–21. 

3
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:22,488
1 The manner of their elders and priests

4
00:00:22,488 --> 00:00:23,655
administering the flesh and blood of

5
00:00:23,655 --> 00:00:24,822
Christ unto the church; and they administered

6
00:00:24,822 --> 00:00:25,989
it according to the commandments of

7
00:00:25,989 --> 00:00:27,156
Christ; wherefore we know the manner to be

8
00:00:27,156 --> 00:00:28,362
true; and the elder or priest did minister it—

9
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:28,362
2 And they did kneel down with

10
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:28,362
the church, and pray to the

11
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:28,829
Father in the name of Christ, saying:

12
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:29,829
3 O God, the Eternal Father,

13
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:30,829
we ask thee in the name of thy

14
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:31,829
Son, Jesus Christ, to bless

15
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:32,829
and sanctify this bread to the

16
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:33,829
souls of all those who partake

17
00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:34,829
of it; that they may eat in

18
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:35,829
remembrance of the body of thy

19
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:36,829
Son, and witness unto thee, O

20
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:37,829
God, the Eternal Father, that

21
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:38,829
they are willing to take upon

22
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:39,829
them the name of thy Son, and

23
00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:40,829
always remember him, and keep

24
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:41,829
his commandments which he hath

25
00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:42,829
given them, that they may

26
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:43,844
always have his Spirit to be with them. Amen.
