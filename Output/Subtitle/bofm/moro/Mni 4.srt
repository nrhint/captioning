Chapter 4 How elders and priests administer the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:03:31,
sacramental bread is explained. About A.D. 401–21. 

3
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
1 The manner of their elders and priests

4
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
administering the flesh and blood of

5
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
Christ unto the church; and they administered

6
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
it according to the commandments of

7
00:03:31,0 --> 00:03:31,0
Christ; wherefore we know the manner to be

8
00:03:31,0 --> 00:05:43,
true; and the elder or priest did minister it—

9
00:05:43,0 --> 00:05:43,0
2 And they did kneel down with

10
00:05:43,0 --> 00:05:43,0
the church, and pray to the

11
00:05:43,0 --> 00:05:15,
Father in the name of Christ, saying:

12
00:05:15,0 --> 00:05:15,0
3 O God, the Eternal Father,

13
00:05:15,0 --> 00:05:15,0
we ask thee in the name of thy

14
00:05:15,0 --> 00:05:15,0
Son, Jesus Christ, to bless

15
00:05:15,0 --> 00:05:15,0
and sanctify this bread to the

16
00:05:15,0 --> 00:05:15,0
souls of all those who partake

17
00:05:15,0 --> 00:05:15,0
of it; that they may eat in

18
00:05:15,0 --> 00:05:15,0
remembrance of the body of thy

19
00:05:15,0 --> 00:05:15,0
Son, and witness unto thee, O

20
00:05:15,0 --> 00:05:15,0
God, the Eternal Father, that

21
00:05:15,0 --> 00:05:15,0
they are willing to take upon

22
00:05:15,0 --> 00:05:15,0
them the name of thy Son, and

23
00:05:15,0 --> 00:05:15,0
always remember him, and keep

24
00:05:15,0 --> 00:05:15,0
his commandments which he hath

25
00:05:15,0 --> 00:05:15,0
given them, that they may

26
00:05:15,0 --> 00:07:27,
always have his Spirit to be with them. Amen.
