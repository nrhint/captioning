Chapter 4 How elders and priests administer the

2
00:00:12,0 --> 00:00:24,0
 sacramental bread is explained. About A.D. 401–21.

3
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:29,457
1 The manner of their elders and priests

4
00:00:29,457 --> 00:00:34,857
 administering the flesh and blood of Christ unto the

5
00:00:34,857 --> 00:00:40,257
 church; and they administered it according to the

6
00:00:40,257 --> 00:00:45,657
 commandments of Christ; wherefore we know the manner to

7
00:00:45,657 --> 00:00:51,057
 be true; and the elder or priest did minister it

8
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:57,985
2 And they did kneel down with the church, and

9
00:00:57,985 --> 00:01:03,985
 pray to the Father in the name of Christ, saying

10
00:01:03,03 --> 00:01:04,63
3 O God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee in the

11
00:01:04,63 --> 00:01:06,23
 name of thy Son, Jesus Christ, to bless and sanctify

12
00:01:06,23 --> 00:01:07,83
 this bread to the souls of all those who partake

13
00:01:07,83 --> 00:01:09,43
 of it; that they may eat in remembrance of the

14
00:01:09,43 --> 00:01:11,03
 body of thy Son, and witness unto thee, O God, the

15
00:01:11,03 --> 00:01:12,63
 Eternal Father, that they are willing to take upon

16
00:01:12,63 --> 00:01:14,23
 them the name of thy Son, and always remember him,

17
00:01:14,23 --> 00:01:15,83
 and keep his commandments which he hath given

18
00:01:15,83 --> 00:01:17,43
 them, that they may always have his Spirit to be with

19
00:01:17,43 --> 00:01:19,03
 them. Amen.
