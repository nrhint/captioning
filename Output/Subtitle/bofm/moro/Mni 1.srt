00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
The Book of MoroniChapter 1 Moroni writes for the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
benefit of the Lamanites—The Nephites who will not

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:03:45,
deny Christ are put to death. About A.D. 401–21. 

4
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
1 Now I, Moroni, after having made an end of

5
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
abridging the account of the people of Jared, I

6
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
had supposed not to have written more, but I

7
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
have not as yet perished; and I make not myself

8
00:03:45,0 --> 00:08:55,
known to the Lamanites lest they should destroy me.

9
00:08:55,0 --> 00:08:55,0
2 For behold, their wars are

10
00:08:55,0 --> 00:08:55,0
exceedingly fierce among themselves; and because

11
00:08:55,0 --> 00:08:55,0
of their hatred they put to death every

12
00:08:55,0 --> 00:08:27,
Nephite that will not deny the Christ.

13
00:08:27,0 --> 00:08:27,0
3 And I, Moroni, will not deny the

14
00:08:27,0 --> 00:08:27,0
Christ; wherefore, I wander whithersoever

15
00:08:27,0 --> 00:07:59,
I can for the safety of mine own life.

16
00:07:59,0 --> 00:07:59,0
4 Wherefore, I write a few more

17
00:07:59,0 --> 00:07:59,0
things, contrary to that which I had

18
00:07:59,0 --> 00:07:59,0
supposed; for I had supposed not to

19
00:07:59,0 --> 00:07:59,0
have written any more; but I write

20
00:07:59,0 --> 00:07:59,0
a few more things, that perhaps

21
00:07:59,0 --> 00:07:59,0
they may be of worth unto my brethren,

22
00:07:59,0 --> 00:07:59,0
the Lamanites, in some future day,

23
00:07:59,0 --> 00:09:11,
according to the will of the Lord.
