00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:06,5
The Book of MoroniChapter 1 Moroni writes for the

2
00:00:06,5 --> 00:00:13,0
 benefit of the Lamanites—The Nephites who will not

3
00:00:13,0 --> 00:00:19,5
 deny Christ are put to death. About A.D. 401–21.

4
00:00:19,5 --> 00:00:26,0


5
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:32,493
1 Now I, Moroni, after having made an end of

6
00:00:32,493 --> 00:00:38,493
 abridging the account of the people of Jared, I had

7
00:00:38,493 --> 00:00:44,493
 supposed not to have written more, but I have not as

8
00:00:44,493 --> 00:00:50,493
 yet perished; and I make not myself known to the

9
00:00:50,493 --> 00:00:56,493
 Lamanites lest they should destroy me

10
00:00:56,723 --> 00:01:03,223
2 For behold, their wars are exceedingly fierce

11
00:01:03,223 --> 00:01:09,723
 among themselves; and because of their hatred they

12
00:01:09,723 --> 00:01:16,223
 put to death every Nephite that will not deny the

13
00:01:16,223 --> 00:01:22,723
 Christ

14
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:28,782
3 And I, Moroni, will not deny the Christ;

15
00:01:28,782 --> 00:01:35,115
 wherefore, I wander whithersoever I can for the safety of

16
00:01:35,115 --> 00:01:41,448
 mine own life

17
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:44,102
4 Wherefore, I write a few more things, contrary

18
00:01:44,102 --> 00:01:46,769
 to that which I had supposed; for I had supposed

19
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:49,436
 not to have written any more; but I write a few more

20
00:01:49,436 --> 00:01:52,103
 things, that perhaps they may be of worth unto my

21
00:01:52,103 --> 00:01:54,77
 brethren, the Lamanites, in some future day,

22
00:01:54,77 --> 00:01:57,437
 according to the will of the Lord.
