00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:07,667
The Book of MoroniChapter 1 Moroni writes for the

2
00:00:07,667 --> 00:00:15,334
benefit of the Lamanites—The Nephites who will not

3
00:00:15,334 --> 00:00:23,924
deny Christ are put to death. About A.D. 401–21. 

4
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:23,724
1 Now I, Moroni, after having made an end of

5
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:23,524
abridging the account of the people of Jared, I

6
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:23,324
had supposed not to have written more, but I

7
00:00:23,324 --> 00:00:23,124
have not as yet perished; and I make not myself

8
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:22,99
known to the Lamanites lest they should destroy me.

9
00:00:22,99 --> 00:00:22,99
2 For behold, their wars are

10
00:00:22,99 --> 00:00:22,99
exceedingly fierce among themselves; and because

11
00:00:22,99 --> 00:00:22,99
of their hatred they put to death every

12
00:00:22,99 --> 00:00:22,055
Nephite that will not deny the Christ.

13
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:21,722
3 And I, Moroni, will not deny the

14
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:21,389
Christ; wherefore, I wander whithersoever

15
00:00:21,389 --> 00:00:21,121
I can for the safety of mine own life.

16
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:20,996
4 Wherefore, I write a few more

17
00:00:20,996 --> 00:00:20,871
things, contrary to that which I had

18
00:00:20,871 --> 00:00:20,746
supposed; for I had supposed not to

19
00:00:20,746 --> 00:00:20,621
have written any more; but I write

20
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:20,496
a few more things, that perhaps

21
00:00:20,496 --> 00:00:20,371
they may be of worth unto my brethren,

22
00:00:20,371 --> 00:00:20,246
the Lamanites, in some future day,

23
00:00:20,246 --> 00:00:20,187
according to the will of the Lord.
