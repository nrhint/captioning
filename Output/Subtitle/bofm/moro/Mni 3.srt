Chapter 3 Elders ordain priests and teachers

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:07:44,
by the laying on of hands. About A.D. 401–21. 

3
00:07:44,0 --> 00:07:44,0
1 The manner which the disciples,

4
00:07:44,0 --> 00:07:44,0
who were called the elders of the

5
00:07:44,0 --> 00:11:15,
church, ordained priests and teachers—

6
00:11:15,0 --> 00:11:15,0
2 After they had prayed unto the

7
00:11:15,0 --> 00:11:15,0
Father in the name of Christ, they

8
00:11:15,0 --> 00:13:57,
laid their hands upon them, and said:

9
00:13:57,0 --> 00:13:57,0
3 In the name of Jesus Christ I

10
00:13:57,0 --> 00:13:57,0
ordain you to be a priest (or if

11
00:13:57,0 --> 00:13:57,0
he be a teacher, I ordain you to

12
00:13:57,0 --> 00:13:57,0
be a teacher) to preach repentance

13
00:13:57,0 --> 00:13:57,0
and remission of sins through

14
00:13:57,0 --> 00:13:57,0
Jesus Christ, by the endurance of

15
00:13:57,0 --> 00:17:42,
faith on his name to the end. Amen.

16
00:17:42,0 --> 00:17:42,0
4 And after this manner did

17
00:17:42,0 --> 00:17:42,0
they ordain priests and teachers,

18
00:17:42,0 --> 00:17:42,0
according to the gifts and

19
00:17:42,0 --> 00:17:42,0
callings of God unto men; and they

20
00:17:42,0 --> 00:17:42,0
ordained them by the power of

21
00:17:42,0 --> 00:17:14,
the Holy Ghost, which was in them.
