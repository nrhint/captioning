Chapter 3 Elders ordain priests and teachers

2
00:00:09,0 --> 00:00:18,352
by the laying on of hands. About A.D. 401–21. 

3
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:19,019
1 The manner which the disciples,

4
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:19,686
who were called the elders of the

5
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:20,754
church, ordained priests and teachers—

6
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:20,421
2 After they had prayed unto the

7
00:00:20,421 --> 00:00:20,088
Father in the name of Christ, they

8
00:00:20,088 --> 00:00:19,82
laid their hands upon them, and said:

9
00:00:19,82 --> 00:00:20,534
3 In the name of Jesus Christ I

10
00:00:20,534 --> 00:00:21,248
ordain you to be a priest (or if

11
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:21,962
he be a teacher, I ordain you to

12
00:00:21,962 --> 00:00:22,676
be a teacher) to preach repentance

13
00:00:22,676 --> 00:00:23,39
and remission of sins through

14
00:00:23,39 --> 00:00:24,104
Jesus Christ, by the endurance of

15
00:00:24,104 --> 00:00:24,224
faith on his name to the end. Amen.

16
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:26,224
4 And after this manner did

17
00:00:26,224 --> 00:00:28,224
they ordain priests and teachers,

18
00:00:28,224 --> 00:00:30,224
according to the gifts and

19
00:00:30,224 --> 00:00:32,224
callings of God unto men; and they

20
00:00:32,224 --> 00:00:34,224
ordained them by the power of

21
00:00:34,224 --> 00:00:36,57
the Holy Ghost, which was in them.
