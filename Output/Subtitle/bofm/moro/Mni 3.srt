Chapter 3 Elders ordain priests and teachers by

2
00:00:12,0 --> 00:00:24,0
 the laying on of hands. About A.D. 401–21.

3
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:29,291
1 The manner which the disciples, who were called

4
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:34,291
 the elders of the church, ordained priests and

5
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:39,291
 teachers

6
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:44,106
2 After they had prayed unto the Father in the

7
00:00:44,106 --> 00:00:48,439
 name of Christ, they laid their hands upon them, and

8
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:52,772
 said

9
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:58,619
3 In the name of Jesus Christ I ordain you to be a

10
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:04,619
 priest (or if he be a teacher, I ordain you to be

11
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:10,619
 a teacher) to preach repentance and remission of

12
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:16,619
 sins through Jesus Christ, by the endurance of

13
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:22,619
 faith on his name to the end. Amen

14
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:28,549
4 And after this manner did they ordain priests

15
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:34,549
 and teachers, according to the gifts and callings of

16
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:40,549
 God unto men; and they ordained them by the power

17
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:46,549
 of the Holy Ghost, which was in them.
