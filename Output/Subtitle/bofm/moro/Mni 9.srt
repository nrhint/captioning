00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:09,167
The second epistle of Mormon to his son Moroni.

2
00:00:09,167 --> 00:00:18,334
 Comprising chapter 9.Chapter 9 Both the Nephites and

3
00:00:18,334 --> 00:00:27,501
 the Lamanites are depraved and degenerate—They

4
00:00:27,501 --> 00:00:36,668
 torture and murder each other—Mormon prays that

5
00:00:36,668 --> 00:00:45,835
 grace and goodness may rest upon Moroni forever. About

6
00:00:45,835 --> 00:00:55,002
 A.D. 401.

7
00:00:55,122 --> 00:01:00,789
1 My beloved son, I write unto you again that ye

8
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:06,456
 may know that I am yet alive; but I write somewhat

9
00:01:06,456 --> 00:01:12,123
 of that which is grievous

10
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:18,606
2 For behold, I have had a sore battle with the

11
00:01:18,606 --> 00:01:24,806
 Lamanites, in which we did not conquer; and

12
00:01:24,806 --> 00:01:31,006
 Archeantus has fallen by the sword, and also Luram and

13
00:01:31,006 --> 00:01:37,206
 Emron; yea, and we have lost a great number of our

14
00:01:37,206 --> 00:01:43,406
 choice men

15
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:48,353
3 And now behold, my son, I fear lest the

16
00:01:48,353 --> 00:01:53,603
 Lamanites shall destroy this people; for they do not

17
00:01:53,603 --> 00:01:58,853
 repent, and Satan stirreth them up continually to anger

18
00:01:58,853 --> 00:02:04,103
 one with another

19
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:21,958
4 Behold, I am laboring with them continually; and

20
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:39,291
 when I speak the word of God with sharpness they

21
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:56,624
 tremble and anger against me; and when I use no

22
00:02:56,624 --> 00:03:13,957
 sharpness they harden their hearts against it;

23
00:03:13,957 --> 00:03:31,29
 wherefore, I fear lest the Spirit of the Lord hath

24
00:03:31,29 --> 00:03:48,623
 ceased striving with them

25
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:52,295
5 For so exceedingly do they anger that it seemeth

26
00:03:52,295 --> 00:03:56,295
 me that they have no fear of death; and they have

27
00:03:56,295 --> 00:04:00,295
 lost their love, one towards another; and they

28
00:04:00,295 --> 00:04:04,295
 thirst after blood and revenge continually

29
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:04,244
6 And now, my beloved son, notwithstanding their

30
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:04,244
 hardness, let us labor diligently; for if we should

31
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:04,244
 cease to labor, we should be brought under

32
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:04,244
 condemnation; for we have a labor to perform whilst in

33
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:04,244
 this tabernacle of clay, that we may conquer the

34
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:04,244
 enemy of all righteousness, and rest our souls in

35
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:04,244
 the kingdom of God

36
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:08,477
7 And now I write somewhat concerning the

37
00:04:08,477 --> 00:04:12,31
 sufferings of this people. For according to the knowledge

38
00:04:12,31 --> 00:04:16,143
 which I have received from Amoron, behold, the

39
00:04:16,143 --> 00:04:19,976
 Lamanites have many prisoners, which they took from

40
00:04:19,976 --> 00:04:23,809
 the tower of Sherrizah; and there were men, women,

41
00:04:23,809 --> 00:04:27,642
 and children

42
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:32,834
8 And the husbands and fathers of those women and

43
00:04:32,834 --> 00:04:38,434
 children they have slain; and they feed the women

44
00:04:38,434 --> 00:04:44,034
 upon the flesh of their husbands, and the children

45
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:49,634
 upon the flesh of their fathers; and no water,

46
00:04:49,634 --> 00:04:55,234
 save a little, do they give unto them

47
00:04:55,962 --> 00:05:01,676
9 And notwithstanding this great abomination of

48
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:07,39
 the Lamanites, it doth not exceed that of our people

49
00:05:07,39 --> 00:05:13,104
 in Moriantum. For behold, many of the daughters

50
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:18,818
 of the Lamanites have they taken prisoners; and

51
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:24,532
 after depriving them of that which was most dear and

52
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:30,246
 precious above all things, which is chastity and

53
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:35,96
 virtue

54
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:41,769
10 And after they had done this thing, they did

55
00:05:41,769 --> 00:05:47,936
 murder them in a most cruel manner, torturing their

56
00:05:47,936 --> 00:05:54,103
 bodies even unto death; and after they have done

57
00:05:54,103 --> 00:06:00,27
 this, they devour their flesh like unto wild

58
00:06:00,27 --> 00:06:06,437
 beasts, because of the hardness of their hearts; and

59
00:06:06,437 --> 00:06:12,604
 they do it for a token of bravery

60
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:21,305
11 O my beloved son, how can a people like this,

61
00:06:21,305 --> 00:06:30,305
 that are without civilization

62
00:06:30,59 --> 00:06:37,59
12 (And only a few years have passed away, and

63
00:06:37,59 --> 00:06:44,59
 they were a civil and a delightsome people

64
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:51,104
13 But O my son, how can a people like this, whose

65
00:06:51,104 --> 00:06:58,104
 delight is in so much abomination

66
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:03,584
14 How can we expect that God will stay his hand

67
00:07:03,584 --> 00:07:09,084
 in judgment against us

68
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:15,112
15 Behold, my heart cries: Wo unto this people.

69
00:07:15,112 --> 00:07:20,862
 Come out in judgment, O God, and hide their sins,

70
00:07:20,862 --> 00:07:26,612
 and wickedness, and abominations from before thy

71
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:32,362
 face

72
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:38,605
16 And again, my son, there are many widows and

73
00:07:38,605 --> 00:07:44,891
 their daughters who remain in Sherrizah; and that

74
00:07:44,891 --> 00:07:51,177
 part of the provisions which the Lamanites did not

75
00:07:51,177 --> 00:07:57,463
 carry away, behold, the army of Zenephi has carried

76
00:07:57,463 --> 00:08:03,749
 away, and left them to wander whithersoever they

77
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:10,035
 can for food; and many old women do faint by the

78
00:08:10,035 --> 00:08:16,321
 way and die

79
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:23,696
17 And the army which is with me is weak; and the

80
00:08:23,696 --> 00:08:31,196
 armies of the Lamanites are betwixt Sherrizah and

81
00:08:31,196 --> 00:08:38,696
 me; and as many as have fled to the army of Aaron

82
00:08:38,696 --> 00:08:46,196
 have fallen victims to their awful brutality

83
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:53,759
18 O the depravity of my people! They are without

84
00:08:53,759 --> 00:09:01,259
 order and without mercy. Behold, I am but a man,

85
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:08,759
 and I have but the strength of a man, and I cannot

86
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:16,259
 any longer enforce my commands

87
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:24,385
19 And they have become strong in their

88
00:09:24,385 --> 00:09:31,814
 perversion; and they are alike brutal, sparing none, neither

89
00:09:31,814 --> 00:09:39,243
 old nor young; and they delight in everything

90
00:09:39,243 --> 00:09:46,672
 save that which is good; and the suffering of our

91
00:09:46,672 --> 00:09:54,101
 women and our children upon all the face of this land

92
00:09:54,101 --> 00:10:01,53
 doth exceed everything; yea, tongue cannot tell,

93
00:10:01,53 --> 00:10:08,959
 neither can it be written

94
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:15,942
20 And now, my son, I dwell no longer upon this

95
00:10:15,942 --> 00:10:22,942
 horrible scene. Behold, thou knowest the wickedness

96
00:10:22,942 --> 00:10:29,942
 of this people; thou knowest that they are without

97
00:10:29,942 --> 00:10:36,942
 principle, and past feeling; and their wickedness

98
00:10:36,942 --> 00:10:43,942
 doth exceed that of the Lamanites

99
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:49,676
21 Behold, my son, I cannot recommend them unto

100
00:10:49,676 --> 00:10:56,176
 God lest he should smite me

101
00:10:56,222 --> 00:11:02,889
22 But behold, my son, I recommend thee unto God,

102
00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:09,556
 and I trust in Christ that thou wilt be saved; and

103
00:11:09,556 --> 00:11:16,223
 I pray unto God that he will spare thy life, to

104
00:11:16,223 --> 00:11:22,89
 witness the return of his people unto him, or their

105
00:11:22,89 --> 00:11:29,557
 utter destruction; for I know that they must

106
00:11:29,557 --> 00:11:36,224
 perish except they repent and return unto him

107
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:42,496
23 And if they perish it will be like unto the

108
00:11:42,496 --> 00:11:48,496
 Jaredites, because of the wilfulness of their hearts,

109
00:11:48,496 --> 00:11:54,496
 seeking for blood and revenge

110
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:59,372
24 And if it so be that they perish, we know that

111
00:11:59,372 --> 00:12:04,497
 many of our brethren have deserted over unto the

112
00:12:04,497 --> 00:12:09,622
 Lamanites, and many more will also desert over unto

113
00:12:09,622 --> 00:12:14,747
 them; wherefore, write somewhat a few things, if

114
00:12:14,747 --> 00:12:19,872
 thou art spared and I shall perish and not see

115
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:24,997
 thee; but I trust that I may see thee soon; for I

116
00:12:24,997 --> 00:12:30,122
 have sacred records that I would deliver up unto

117
00:12:30,122 --> 00:12:35,247
 thee
