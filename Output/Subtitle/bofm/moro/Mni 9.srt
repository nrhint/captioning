00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:02,0
The second epistle of Mormon to his son

2
00:00:02,0 --> 00:00:04,0
Moroni. Comprising chapter 9.Chapter 9 Both

3
00:00:04,0 --> 00:00:06,0
the Nephites and the Lamanites are depraved

4
00:00:06,0 --> 00:00:08,0
and degenerate—They torture and murder each

5
00:00:08,0 --> 00:00:10,0
other—Mormon prays that grace and goodness

6
00:00:10,0 --> 00:00:12,379
may rest upon Moroni forever. About A.D. 401. 

7
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:13,046
1 My beloved son, I write unto you again

8
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:13,713
that ye may know that I am yet alive; but I

9
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:14,781
write somewhat of that which is grievous.

10
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:17,781
2 For behold, I have had a sore battle

11
00:00:17,781 --> 00:00:20,781
with the Lamanites, in which we did not

12
00:00:20,781 --> 00:00:23,781
conquer; and Archeantus has fallen by the

13
00:00:23,781 --> 00:00:26,781
sword, and also Luram and Emron; yea, and

14
00:00:26,781 --> 00:00:29,062
we have lost a great number of our choice men.

15
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:33,662
3 And now behold, my son, I fear

16
00:00:33,662 --> 00:00:38,262
lest the Lamanites shall destroy

17
00:00:38,262 --> 00:00:42,862
this people; for they do not

18
00:00:42,862 --> 00:00:47,462
repent, and Satan stirreth them up

19
00:00:47,462 --> 00:00:52,519
continually to anger one with another.

20
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:52,408
4 Behold, I am laboring with

21
00:00:52,408 --> 00:00:52,297
them continually; and when I

22
00:00:52,297 --> 00:00:52,186
speak the word of God with

23
00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:52,075
sharpness they tremble and anger

24
00:00:52,075 --> 00:00:51,964
against me; and when I use no

25
00:00:51,964 --> 00:00:51,853
sharpness they harden their

26
00:00:51,853 --> 00:00:51,742
hearts against it; wherefore, I

27
00:00:51,742 --> 00:00:51,631
fear lest the Spirit of the Lord

28
00:00:51,631 --> 00:00:51,585
hath ceased striving with them.

29
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:51,442
5 For so exceedingly do

30
00:00:51,442 --> 00:00:51,299
they anger that it seemeth me

31
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:51,156
that they have no fear of

32
00:00:51,156 --> 00:00:51,013
death; and they have lost

33
00:00:51,013 --> 00:00:50,87
their love, one towards

34
00:00:50,87 --> 00:00:50,727
another; and they thirst after

35
00:00:50,727 --> 00:00:50,651
blood and revenge continually.

36
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:51,068
6 And now, my beloved son,

37
00:00:51,068 --> 00:00:51,485
notwithstanding their

38
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:51,902
hardness, let us labor

39
00:00:51,902 --> 00:00:52,319
diligently; for if we should

40
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:52,736
cease to labor, we should be

41
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,153
brought under

42
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:53,57
condemnation; for we have a labor to

43
00:00:53,57 --> 00:00:53,987
perform whilst in this

44
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:54,404
tabernacle of clay, that we

45
00:00:54,404 --> 00:00:54,821
may conquer the enemy of all

46
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:55,238
righteousness, and rest

47
00:00:55,238 --> 00:00:55,055
our souls in the kingdom of God.

48
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:54,964
7 And now I write

49
00:00:54,964 --> 00:00:54,873
somewhat concerning the

50
00:00:54,873 --> 00:00:54,782
sufferings of this people.

51
00:00:54,782 --> 00:00:54,691
For according to the

52
00:00:54,691 --> 00:00:54,6
knowledge which I have

53
00:00:54,6 --> 00:00:54,509
received from Amoron,

54
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:54,418
behold, the Lamanites have

55
00:00:54,418 --> 00:00:54,327
many prisoners, which

56
00:00:54,327 --> 00:00:54,236
they took from the

57
00:00:54,236 --> 00:00:54,145
tower of Sherrizah; and

58
00:00:54,145 --> 00:00:54,121
there were men, women, and children.

59
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:55,666
8 And the husbands

60
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:57,211
and fathers of those

61
00:00:57,211 --> 00:00:58,756
women and children they

62
00:00:58,756 --> 00:01:00,301
have slain; and they

63
00:01:00,301 --> 00:01:01,846
feed the women upon

64
00:01:01,846 --> 00:01:03,391
the flesh of their

65
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:04,936
husbands, and the

66
00:01:04,936 --> 00:01:06,481
children upon the flesh of

67
00:01:06,481 --> 00:01:08,026
their fathers; and

68
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,571
no water, save a

69
00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:11,538
little, do they give unto them.

70
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:12,538
9 And

71
00:01:12,538 --> 00:01:13,538
notwithstanding this great

72
00:01:13,538 --> 00:01:14,538
abomination of the

73
00:01:14,538 --> 00:01:15,538
Lamanites, it doth not

74
00:01:15,538 --> 00:01:16,538
exceed that of our people

75
00:01:16,538 --> 00:01:17,538
in Moriantum. For

76
00:01:17,538 --> 00:01:18,538
behold, many of the

77
00:01:18,538 --> 00:01:19,538
daughters of the

78
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:20,538
Lamanites have they

79
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:21,538
taken prisoners; and

80
00:01:21,538 --> 00:01:22,538
after depriving them of

81
00:01:22,538 --> 00:01:23,538
that which was most

82
00:01:23,538 --> 00:01:24,538
dear and precious

83
00:01:24,538 --> 00:01:25,538
above all things,

84
00:01:25,538 --> 00:01:26,52
which is chastity and virtue—

85
00:01:26,52 --> 00:01:27,32
10 And after they

86
00:01:27,32 --> 00:01:28,12
had done this

87
00:01:28,12 --> 00:01:28,92
thing, they did murder

88
00:01:28,92 --> 00:01:29,72
them in a most

89
00:01:29,72 --> 00:01:30,52
cruel manner,

90
00:01:30,52 --> 00:01:31,32
torturing their bodies

91
00:01:31,32 --> 00:01:32,12
even unto death;

92
00:01:32,12 --> 00:01:32,92
and after they have

93
00:01:32,92 --> 00:01:33,72
done this, they

94
00:01:33,72 --> 00:01:34,52
devour their flesh

95
00:01:34,52 --> 00:01:35,32
like unto wild

96
00:01:35,32 --> 00:01:36,12
beasts, because of the

97
00:01:36,12 --> 00:01:36,92
hardness of their

98
00:01:36,92 --> 00:01:37,72
hearts; and they

99
00:01:37,72 --> 00:01:38,899
do it for a token of bravery.

100
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:38,699
11 O my beloved

101
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:38,499
son, how can a

102
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:38,299
people like

103
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:38,099
this, that are

104
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:37,965
without civilization—

105
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:38,798
12 (And only a

106
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:39,631
few years have

107
00:01:39,631 --> 00:01:40,464
passed away,

108
00:01:40,464 --> 00:01:41,297
and they were a

109
00:01:41,297 --> 00:01:42,13
civil and a

110
00:01:42,13 --> 00:01:42,369
delightsome people)

111
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:44,869
13 But O my

112
00:01:44,869 --> 00:01:47,369
son, how can a

113
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:49,869
people like

114
00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:52,369
this, whose

115
00:01:52,369 --> 00:01:54,869
delight is in so

116
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:57,351
much abomination—

117
00:01:57,351 --> 00:01:58,518
14 How can

118
00:01:58,518 --> 00:01:59,685
we expect

119
00:01:59,685 --> 00:02:00,852
that God will

120
00:02:00,852 --> 00:02:02,019
stay his hand

121
00:02:02,019 --> 00:02:03,186
in judgment

122
00:02:03,186 --> 00:02:04,391
against us?

123
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:06,776
15 Behold,

124
00:02:06,776 --> 00:02:09,161
my heart

125
00:02:09,161 --> 00:02:11,546
cries: Wo

126
00:02:11,546 --> 00:02:13,931
unto this

127
00:02:13,931 --> 00:02:16,316
people. Come

128
00:02:16,316 --> 00:02:18,701
out in

129
00:02:18,701 --> 00:02:21,086
judgment, O God,

130
00:02:21,086 --> 00:02:23,471
and hide

131
00:02:23,471 --> 00:02:25,856
their sins,

132
00:02:25,856 --> 00:02:28,241
and

133
00:02:28,241 --> 00:02:30,626
wickedness, and

134
00:02:30,626 --> 00:02:33,011
abominations

135
00:02:33,011 --> 00:02:35,822
from before thy face!

136
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:36,443
16 And

137
00:02:36,443 --> 00:02:37,064
again, my

138
00:02:37,064 --> 00:02:37,685
son, there

139
00:02:37,685 --> 00:02:38,306
are many

140
00:02:38,306 --> 00:02:38,927
widows and

141
00:02:38,927 --> 00:02:39,548
their

142
00:02:39,548 --> 00:02:40,169
daughters who

143
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:40,79
remain in

144
00:02:40,79 --> 00:02:41,411
Sherrizah;

145
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,032
and that

146
00:02:42,032 --> 00:02:42,653
part of the

147
00:02:42,653 --> 00:02:43,274
provisions

148
00:02:43,274 --> 00:02:43,895
which the

149
00:02:43,895 --> 00:02:44,516
Lamanites

150
00:02:44,516 --> 00:02:45,137
did not

151
00:02:45,137 --> 00:02:45,758
carry away,

152
00:02:45,758 --> 00:02:46,379
behold,

153
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:47,0
the army of

154
00:02:47,0 --> 00:02:47,621
Zenephi

155
00:02:47,621 --> 00:02:48,242
has carried

156
00:02:48,242 --> 00:02:48,863
away, and

157
00:02:48,863 --> 00:02:49,484
left them

158
00:02:49,484 --> 00:02:50,105
to wander

159
00:02:50,105 --> 00:02:50,726


160
00:02:50,726 --> 00:02:51,347
whithersoever they

161
00:02:51,347 --> 00:02:51,968
can for

162
00:02:51,968 --> 00:02:52,589
food; and

163
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:53,21
many old

164
00:02:53,21 --> 00:02:53,707
women do faint by the way and die.

165
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:53,807
17 And

166
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:53,907
the army

167
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:54,007
which is

168
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:54,107
with me is

169
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:54,207
weak; and

170
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:54,307
the

171
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:54,407
armies of the

172
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:54,507


173
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:54,607
Lamanites are

174
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:54,707
betwixt

175
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:54,807
Sherrizah and

176
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:54,907
me; and

177
00:02:54,907 --> 00:02:55,007
as many

178
00:02:55,007 --> 00:02:55,107
as have

179
00:02:55,107 --> 00:02:55,207
fled to the

180
00:02:55,207 --> 00:02:55,307
army of

181
00:02:55,307 --> 00:02:55,407
Aaron

182
00:02:55,407 --> 00:02:55,507
have fallen

183
00:02:55,507 --> 00:02:55,607
victims

184
00:02:55,607 --> 00:02:55,175
to their awful brutality.

185
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:55,127
18 O the

186
00:02:55,127 --> 00:02:55,079


187
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:55,031
depravity of my

188
00:02:55,031 --> 00:02:54,983
people!

189
00:02:54,983 --> 00:02:54,935
They

190
00:02:54,935 --> 00:02:54,887
are

191
00:02:54,887 --> 00:02:54,839
without order

192
00:02:54,839 --> 00:02:54,791
and

193
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:54,743
without

194
00:02:54,743 --> 00:02:54,695
mercy.

195
00:02:54,695 --> 00:02:54,647
Behold, I am

196
00:02:54,647 --> 00:02:54,599
but a

197
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:54,551
man, and I

198
00:02:54,551 --> 00:02:54,503
have

199
00:02:54,503 --> 00:02:54,455
but the

200
00:02:54,455 --> 00:02:54,407
strength

201
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:54,359
of a man,

202
00:02:54,359 --> 00:02:54,311
