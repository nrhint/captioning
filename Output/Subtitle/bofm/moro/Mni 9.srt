1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
The second epistle of Mormon to his son

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Moroni. Comprising chapter 9.Chapter 9 Both

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Nephites and the Lamanites are depraved

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and degenerate—They torture and murder each

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
other—Mormon prays that grace and goodness

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:06:41,
may rest upon Moroni forever. About A.D. 401. 

7
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
1 My beloved son, I write unto you again

8
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
that ye may know that I am yet alive; but I

9
00:06:41,0 --> 00:15:22,
write somewhat of that which is grievous.

10
00:15:22,0 --> 00:15:22,0
2 For behold, I have had a sore battle

11
00:15:22,0 --> 00:15:22,0
with the Lamanites, in which we did not

12
00:15:22,0 --> 00:15:22,0
conquer; and Archeantus has fallen by the

13
00:15:22,0 --> 00:15:22,0
sword, and also Luram and Emron; yea, and

14
00:15:22,0 --> 00:17:34,
we have lost a great number of our choice men.

15
00:17:34,0 --> 00:17:34,0
3 And now behold, my son, I fear

16
00:17:34,0 --> 00:17:34,0
lest the Lamanites shall destroy

17
00:17:34,0 --> 00:17:34,0
this people; for they do not

18
00:17:34,0 --> 00:17:34,0
repent, and Satan stirreth them up

19
00:17:34,0 --> 00:22:44,
continually to anger one with another.

20
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
4 Behold, I am laboring with

21
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
them continually; and when I

22
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
speak the word of God with

23
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
sharpness they tremble and anger

24
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
against me; and when I use no

25
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
sharpness they harden their

26
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
hearts against it; wherefore, I

27
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
fear lest the Spirit of the Lord

28
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,
hath ceased striving with them.

29
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
5 For so exceedingly do

30
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
they anger that it seemeth me

31
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
that they have no fear of

32
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
death; and they have lost

33
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
their love, one towards

34
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
another; and they thirst after

35
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,
blood and revenge continually.

36
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
6 And now, my beloved son,

37
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
notwithstanding their

38
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
hardness, let us labor

39
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
diligently; for if we should

40
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
cease to labor, we should be

41
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
brought under

42
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
condemnation; for we have a labor to

43
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
perform whilst in this

44
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
tabernacle of clay, that we

45
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
may conquer the enemy of all

46
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
righteousness, and rest

47
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,
our souls in the kingdom of God.

48
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
7 And now I write

49
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
somewhat concerning the

50
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
sufferings of this people.

51
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
For according to the

52
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
knowledge which I have

53
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
received from Amoron,

54
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
behold, the Lamanites have

55
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
many prisoners, which

56
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
they took from the

57
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
tower of Sherrizah; and

58
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,
there were men, women, and children.

59
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
8 And the husbands

60
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
and fathers of those

61
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
women and children they

62
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
have slain; and they

63
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
feed the women upon

64
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
the flesh of their

65
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
husbands, and the

66
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
children upon the flesh of

67
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
their fathers; and

68
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
no water, save a

69
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,
little, do they give unto them.

70
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
9 And

71
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
notwithstanding this great

72
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
abomination of the

73
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
Lamanites, it doth not

74
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
exceed that of our people

75
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
in Moriantum. For

76
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
behold, many of the

77
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
daughters of the

78
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
Lamanites have they

79
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
taken prisoners; and

80
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
after depriving them of

81
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
that which was most

82
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
dear and precious

83
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
above all things,

84
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,
which is chastity and virtue—

85
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
10 And after they

86
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
had done this

87
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
thing, they did murder

88
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
them in a most

89
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
cruel manner,

90
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
torturing their bodies

91
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
even unto death;

92
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
and after they have

93
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
done this, they

94
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
devour their flesh

95
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
like unto wild

96
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
beasts, because of the

97
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
hardness of their

98
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
hearts; and they

99
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,
do it for a token of bravery.

100
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
11 O my beloved

101
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
son, how can a

102
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
people like

103
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
this, that are

104
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,
without civilization—

105
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
12 (And only a

106
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
few years have

107
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
passed away,

108
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
and they were a

109
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
civil and a

110
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,
delightsome people)

111
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
13 But O my

112
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
son, how can a

113
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
people like

114
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
this, whose

115
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
delight is in so

116
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,
much abomination—

117
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
14 How can

118
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
we expect

119
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
that God will

120
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
stay his hand

121
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
in judgment

122
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,
against us?

123
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
15 Behold,

124
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
my heart

125
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
cries: Wo

126
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
unto this

127
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
people. Come

128
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
out in

129
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
judgment, O God,

130
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
and hide

131
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
their sins,

132
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
and

133
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
wickedness, and

134
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
abominations

135
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,
from before thy face!

136
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
16 And

137
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
again, my

138
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
son, there

139
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
are many

140
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
widows and

141
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
their

142
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
daughters who

143
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
remain in

144
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
Sherrizah;

145
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
and that

146
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
part of the

147
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
provisions

148
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
which the

149
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
Lamanites

150
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
did not

151
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
carry away,

152
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
behold,

153
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
the army of

154
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
Zenephi

155
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
has carried

156
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
away, and

157
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
left them

158
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
to wander

159
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0


160
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
whithersoever they

161
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
can for

162
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
food; and

163
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
many old

164
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,
women do faint by the way and die.

165
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
17 And

166
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
the army

167
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
which is

168
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
with me is

169
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
weak; and

170
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
the

171
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
armies of the

172
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0


173
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
Lamanites are

174
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
betwixt

175
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
Sherrizah and

176
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
me; and

177
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
as many

178
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
as have

179
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
fled to the

180
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
army of

181
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
Aaron

182
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
have fallen

183
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
victims

184
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,
to their awful brutality.

185
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
18 O the

186
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0


187
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
depravity of my

188
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
people!

189
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
They

190
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
are

191
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
without order

192
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
and

193
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
without

194
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
mercy.

195
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
Behold, I am

196
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
but a

197
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
man, and I

198
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
have

199
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
but the

200
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
strength

201
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
of a man,

202
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
and I

203
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
cannot

204
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
any longer

205
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,
enforce my commands.

206
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
19 And

207
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
they

208
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
have

209
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
become

210
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
strong in

211
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
their

212
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0


213
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
perversion; and

214
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
they

215
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
are alike

216
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0


217
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
brutal,

218
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
sparing

219
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
none,

220
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
neither old

221
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
nor

222
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
young; and

223
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
they

224
00:22:44,0 --> 00:22:44,0
