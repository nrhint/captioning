00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:02,5
Chapter 10 A testimony of the Book of Mormon comes

2
00:00:02,5 --> 00:00:05,0
 by the power of the Holy Ghost—The gifts of the

3
00:00:05,0 --> 00:00:07,5
 Spirit are dispensed to the faithful—Spiritual

4
00:00:07,5 --> 00:00:10,0
 gifts always accompany faith—Moroni’s words speak from

5
00:00:10,0 --> 00:00:12,5
 the dust—Come unto Christ, be perfected in Him,

6
00:00:12,5 --> 00:00:15,0
 and sanctify your souls. About A.D. 421.

7
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:30,149
1 Now I, Moroni, write somewhat as seemeth me

8
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:44,349
 good; and I write unto my brethren, the Lamanites; and

9
00:00:44,349 --> 00:00:58,549
 I would that they should know that more than four

10
00:00:58,549 --> 00:01:12,749
 hundred and twenty years have passed away since

11
00:01:12,749 --> 00:01:26,949
 the sign was given of the coming of Christ

12
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:33,786
2 And I seal up these records, after I have spoken

13
00:01:33,786 --> 00:01:41,286
 a few words by way of exhortation unto you

14
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:46,554
3 Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall

15
00:01:46,554 --> 00:01:51,84
 read these things, if it be wisdom in God that ye

16
00:01:51,84 --> 00:01:57,126
 should read them, that ye would remember how

17
00:01:57,126 --> 00:02:02,412
 merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men,

18
00:02:02,412 --> 00:02:07,698
 from the creation of Adam even down until the time

19
00:02:07,698 --> 00:02:12,984
 that ye shall receive these things, and ponder it in

20
00:02:12,984 --> 00:02:18,27
 your hearts

21
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:24,025
4 And when ye shall receive these things, I would

22
00:02:24,025 --> 00:02:29,311
 exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal

23
00:02:29,311 --> 00:02:34,597
 Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not

24
00:02:34,597 --> 00:02:39,883
 true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart,

25
00:02:39,883 --> 00:02:45,169
 with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will

26
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:50,455
 manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of

27
00:02:50,455 --> 00:02:55,741
 the Holy Ghost

28
00:02:55,942 --> 00:03:00,942
5 And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know

29
00:03:00,942 --> 00:03:05,942
 the truth of all things

30
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:13,285
6 And whatsoever thing is good is just and true;

31
00:03:13,285 --> 00:03:20,618
 wherefore, nothing that is good denieth the Christ,

32
00:03:20,618 --> 00:03:27,951
 but acknowledgeth that he is

33
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:34,207
7 And ye may know that he is, by the power of the

34
00:03:34,207 --> 00:03:41,207
 Holy Ghost; wherefore I would exhort you that ye

35
00:03:41,207 --> 00:03:48,207
 deny not the power of God; for he worketh by power,

36
00:03:48,207 --> 00:03:55,207
 according to the faith of the children of men,

37
00:03:55,207 --> 00:04:02,207
 the same today and tomorrow, and forever

38
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:09,356
8 And again, I exhort you, my brethren, that ye

39
00:04:09,356 --> 00:04:16,07
 deny not the gifts of God, for they are many; and

40
00:04:16,07 --> 00:04:22,784
 they come from the same God. And there are different

41
00:04:22,784 --> 00:04:29,498
 ways that these gifts are administered; but it is

42
00:04:29,498 --> 00:04:36,212
 the same God who worketh all in all; and they are

43
00:04:36,212 --> 00:04:42,926
 given by the manifestations of the Spirit of God

44
00:04:42,926 --> 00:04:49,64
 unto men, to profit them

45
00:04:49,79 --> 00:04:56,29
9 For behold, to one is given by the Spirit of

46
00:04:56,29 --> 00:05:02,79
 God, that he may teach the word of wisdom

47
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:09,336
10 And to another, that he may teach the word of

48
00:05:09,336 --> 00:05:15,836
 knowledge by the same Spirit

49
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:21,182
11 And to another, exceedingly great faith; and to

50
00:05:21,182 --> 00:05:26,515
 another, the gifts of healing by the same Spirit

51
00:05:26,515 --> 00:05:31,848


52
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:36,831
12 And again, to another, that he may work mighty

53
00:05:36,831 --> 00:05:42,331
 miracles

54
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:47,609
13 And again, to another, that he may prophesy

55
00:05:47,609 --> 00:05:52,609
 concerning all things

56
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:57,885
14 And again, to another, the beholding of angels

57
00:05:57,885 --> 00:06:03,385
 and ministering spirits

58
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:10,463
15 And again, to another, all kinds of tongues

59
00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:15,737
16 And again, to another, the interpretation of

60
00:06:15,737 --> 00:06:21,237
 languages and of divers kinds of tongues

61
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:27,248
17 And all these gifts come by the Spirit of

62
00:06:27,248 --> 00:06:33,248
 Christ; and they come unto every man severally,

63
00:06:33,248 --> 00:06:39,248
 according as he will

64
00:06:39,0 --> 00:06:46,333
18 And I would exhort you, my beloved brethren,

65
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:52,666
 that ye remember that every good gift cometh of

66
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:58,999
 Christ

67
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:04,065
19 And I would exhort you, my beloved brethren,

68
00:07:04,065 --> 00:07:09,779
 that ye remember that he is the same yesterday,

69
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:15,493
 today, and forever, and that all these gifts of which

70
00:07:15,493 --> 00:07:21,207
 I have spoken, which are spiritual, never will be

71
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:26,921
 done away, even as long as the world shall stand,

72
00:07:26,921 --> 00:07:32,635
 only according to the unbelief of the children of

73
00:07:32,635 --> 00:07:38,349
 men

74
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:45,758
20 Wherefore, there must be faith; and if there

75
00:07:45,758 --> 00:07:53,091
 must be faith there must also be hope; and if there

76
00:07:53,091 --> 00:08:00,424
 must be hope there must also be charity

77
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:06,396
21 And except ye have charity ye can in nowise be

78
00:08:06,396 --> 00:08:12,646
 saved in the kingdom of God; neither can ye be

79
00:08:12,646 --> 00:08:18,896
 saved in the kingdom of God if ye have not faith;

80
00:08:18,896 --> 00:08:25,146
 neither can ye if ye have no hope

81
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:33,372
22 And if ye have no hope ye must needs be in

82
00:08:33,372 --> 00:08:40,872
 despair; and despair cometh because of iniquity

83
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:46,653
23 And Christ truly said unto our fathers: If ye

84
00:08:46,653 --> 00:08:52,653
 have faith ye can do all things which are expedient

85
00:08:52,653 --> 00:08:58,653
 unto me

86
00:08:58,405 --> 00:09:03,655
24 And now I speak unto all the ends of the

87
00:09:03,655 --> 00:09:08,905
 earth—that if the day cometh that the power and gifts of

88
00:09:08,905 --> 00:09:14,155
 God shall be done away among you, it shall be

89
00:09:14,155 --> 00:09:19,405
 because of unbelief

90
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:26,293
25 And wo be unto the children of men if this be

91
00:09:26,293 --> 00:09:32,693
 the case; for there shall be none that doeth good

92
00:09:32,693 --> 00:09:39,093
 among you, no not one. For if there be one among

93
00:09:39,093 --> 00:09:45,493
 you that doeth good, he shall work by the power and

94
00:09:45,493 --> 00:09:51,893
 gifts of God

95
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:58,558
26 And wo unto them who shall do these things away

96
00:09:58,558 --> 00:10:05,558
 and die, for they die in their sins, and they

97
00:10:05,558 --> 00:10:12,558
 cannot be saved in the kingdom of God; and I speak it

98
00:10:12,558 --> 00:10:19,558
 according to the words of Christ; and I lie not

99
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:26,533
27 And I exhort you to remember these things; for

100
00:10:26,533 --> 00:10:33,247
 the time speedily cometh that ye shall know that I

101
00:10:33,247 --> 00:10:39,961
 lie not, for ye shall see me at the bar of God;

102
00:10:39,961 --> 00:10:46,675
 and the Lord God will say unto you: Did I not

103
00:10:46,675 --> 00:10:53,389
 declare my words unto you, which were written by this

104
00:10:53,389 --> 00:11:00,103
 man, like as one crying from the dead, yea, even as

105
00:11:00,103 --> 00:11:06,817
 one speaking out of the dust

106
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:12,966
28 I declare these things unto the fulfilling of

107
00:11:12,966 --> 00:11:18,966
 the prophecies. And behold, they shall proceed

108
00:11:18,966 --> 00:11:24,966
 forth out of the mouth of the everlasting God; and his

109
00:11:24,966 --> 00:11:30,966
 word shall hiss forth from generation to

110
00:11:30,966 --> 00:11:36,966
 generation

111
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:40,229
29 And God shall show unto you, that that which I

112
00:11:40,229 --> 00:11:44,229
 have written is true

113
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:50,821
30 And again I would exhort you that ye would come

114
00:11:50,821 --> 00:11:57,071
 unto Christ, and lay hold upon every good gift,

115
00:11:57,071 --> 00:12:03,321
 and touch not the evil gift, nor the unclean thing

116
00:12:03,321 --> 00:12:09,571


117
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:16,848
31 And awake, and arise from the dust, O

118
00:12:16,848 --> 00:12:24,134
 Jerusalem; yea, and put on thy beautiful garments, O

119
00:12:24,134 --> 00:12:31,42
 daughter of Zion; and strengthen thy stakes and enlarge

120
00:12:31,42 --> 00:12:38,706
 thy borders forever, that thou mayest no more be

121
00:12:38,706 --> 00:12:45,992
 confounded, that the covenants of the Eternal

122
00:12:45,992 --> 00:12:53,278
 Father which he hath made unto thee, O house of Israel,

123
00:12:53,278 --> 00:13:00,564
 may be fulfilled

124
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:08,838
32 Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him,

125
00:13:08,838 --> 00:13:16,963
 and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye

126
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:25,088
 shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and

127
00:13:25,088 --> 00:13:33,213
 love God with all your might, mind and strength, then

128
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:41,338
 is his grace sufficient for you, that by his

129
00:13:41,338 --> 00:13:49,463
 grace ye may be perfect in Christ; and if by the grace

130
00:13:49,463 --> 00:13:57,588
 of God ye are perfect in Christ, ye can in nowise

131
00:13:57,588 --> 00:14:05,713
 deny the power of God

132
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:11,944
33 And again, if ye by the grace of God are

133
00:14:11,944 --> 00:14:18,777
 perfect in Christ, and deny not his power, then are ye

134
00:14:18,777 --> 00:14:25,61
 sanctified in Christ by the grace of God, through

135
00:14:25,61 --> 00:14:32,443
 the shedding of the blood of Christ, which is in

136
00:14:32,443 --> 00:14:39,276
 the covenant of the Father unto the remission of

137
00:14:39,276 --> 00:14:46,109
 your sins, that ye become holy, without spot

138
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:52,552
34 And now I bid unto all, farewell. I soon go to

139
00:14:52,552 --> 00:14:59,052
 rest in the paradise of God, until my spirit and

140
00:14:59,052 --> 00:15:05,552
 body shall again reunite, and I am brought forth

141
00:15:05,552 --> 00:15:12,052
 triumphant through the air, to meet you before the

142
00:15:12,052 --> 00:15:18,552
 pleasing bar of the great Jehovah, the Eternal

143
00:15:18,552 --> 00:15:25,052
 Judge of both quick and dead. Amen.The End
