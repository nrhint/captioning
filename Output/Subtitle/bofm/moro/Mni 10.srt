00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 10 A testimony of the Book of Mormon

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
comes by the power of the Holy Ghost—The gifts of

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Spirit are dispensed to the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
faithful—Spiritual gifts always accompany faith—Moroni’s words

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
speak from the dust—Come unto Christ, be perfected

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:04:43,
in Him, and sanctify your souls. About A.D. 421. 

7
00:04:43,0 --> 00:04:43,0
1 Now I, Moroni, write somewhat as

8
00:04:43,0 --> 00:04:43,0
seemeth me good; and I write unto my

9
00:04:43,0 --> 00:04:43,0
brethren, the Lamanites; and I would that they

10
00:04:43,0 --> 00:04:43,0
should know that more than four hundred

11
00:04:43,0 --> 00:04:43,0
and twenty years have passed away since

12
00:04:43,0 --> 00:18:51,
the sign was given of the coming of Christ.

13
00:18:51,0 --> 00:18:51,0
2 And I seal up these records,

14
00:18:51,0 --> 00:18:51,0
after I have spoken a few words

15
00:18:51,0 --> 00:20:03,
by way of exhortation unto you.

16
00:20:03,0 --> 00:20:03,0
3 Behold, I would exhort you

17
00:20:03,0 --> 00:20:03,0
that when ye shall read

18
00:20:03,0 --> 00:20:03,0
these things, if it be wisdom

19
00:20:03,0 --> 00:20:03,0
in God that ye should read

20
00:20:03,0 --> 00:20:03,0
them, that ye would remember

21
00:20:03,0 --> 00:20:03,0
how merciful the Lord hath

22
00:20:03,0 --> 00:20:03,0
been unto the children of men,

23
00:20:03,0 --> 00:20:03,0
from the creation of Adam

24
00:20:03,0 --> 00:20:03,0
even down until the time that

25
00:20:03,0 --> 00:20:03,0
ye shall receive these

26
00:20:03,0 --> 00:26:14,
things, and ponder it in your hearts.

27
00:26:14,0 --> 00:26:14,0
4 And when ye shall

28
00:26:14,0 --> 00:26:14,0
receive these things, I would

29
00:26:14,0 --> 00:26:14,0
exhort you that ye would ask

30
00:26:14,0 --> 00:26:14,0
God, the Eternal Father,

31
00:26:14,0 --> 00:26:14,0
in the name of Christ, if

32
00:26:14,0 --> 00:26:14,0
these things are not true;

33
00:26:14,0 --> 00:26:14,0
and if ye shall ask with

34
00:26:14,0 --> 00:26:14,0
a sincere heart, with real

35
00:26:14,0 --> 00:26:14,0
intent, having faith in

36
00:26:14,0 --> 00:26:14,0
Christ, he will manifest

37
00:26:14,0 --> 00:26:14,0
the truth of it unto you, by

38
00:26:14,0 --> 00:28:26,
the power of the Holy Ghost.

39
00:28:26,0 --> 00:28:26,0
5 And by the power of

40
00:28:26,0 --> 00:28:26,0
the Holy Ghost ye may know

41
00:28:26,0 --> 00:34:22,
the truth of all things.

42
00:34:22,0 --> 00:34:22,0
6 And whatsoever

43
00:34:22,0 --> 00:34:22,0
thing is good is just and

44
00:34:22,0 --> 00:34:22,0
true; wherefore,

45
00:34:22,0 --> 00:34:22,0
nothing that is good

46
00:34:22,0 --> 00:34:22,0
denieth the Christ, but

47
00:34:22,0 --> 00:41:31,
acknowledgeth that he is.

48
00:41:31,0 --> 00:41:31,0
7 And ye may know

49
00:41:31,0 --> 00:41:31,0
that he is, by the

50
00:41:31,0 --> 00:41:31,0
power of the Holy

51
00:41:31,0 --> 00:41:31,0
Ghost; wherefore I

52
00:41:31,0 --> 00:41:31,0
would exhort you that

53
00:41:31,0 --> 00:41:31,0
ye deny not the

54
00:41:31,0 --> 00:41:31,0
power of God; for he

55
00:41:31,0 --> 00:41:31,0
worketh by power,

56
00:41:31,0 --> 00:41:31,0
according to the

57
00:41:31,0 --> 00:41:31,0
faith of the children

58
00:41:31,0 --> 00:41:31,0
of men, the same

59
00:41:31,0 --> 00:43:43,
today and tomorrow, and forever.

60
00:43:43,0 --> 00:43:43,0
8 And again, I

61
00:43:43,0 --> 00:43:43,0
exhort you, my

62
00:43:43,0 --> 00:43:43,0
brethren, that ye deny

63
00:43:43,0 --> 00:43:43,0
not the gifts of

64
00:43:43,0 --> 00:43:43,0
God, for they are

65
00:43:43,0 --> 00:43:43,0
many; and they come

66
00:43:43,0 --> 00:43:43,0
from the same God.

67
00:43:43,0 --> 00:43:43,0
And there are

68
00:43:43,0 --> 00:43:43,0
different ways that

69
00:43:43,0 --> 00:43:43,0
these gifts are

70
00:43:43,0 --> 00:43:43,0
administered; but it

71
00:43:43,0 --> 00:43:43,0
is the same God

72
00:43:43,0 --> 00:43:43,0
who worketh all in

73
00:43:43,0 --> 00:43:43,0
all; and they are

74
00:43:43,0 --> 00:43:43,0
given by the

75
00:43:43,0 --> 00:43:43,0
manifestations of the

76
00:43:43,0 --> 00:43:43,0
Spirit of God unto

77
00:43:43,0 --> 00:49:11,
men, to profit them.

78
00:49:11,0 --> 00:49:11,0
9 For behold, to

79
00:49:11,0 --> 00:49:11,0
one is given by

80
00:49:11,0 --> 00:49:11,0
the Spirit of God,

81
00:49:11,0 --> 00:49:11,0
that he may

82
00:49:11,0 --> 00:48:43,
teach the word of wisdom;

83
00:48:43,0 --> 00:48:43,0
10 And to

84
00:48:43,0 --> 00:48:43,0
another, that he may

85
00:48:43,0 --> 00:48:43,0
teach the word

86
00:48:43,0 --> 00:48:43,0
of knowledge

87
00:48:43,0 --> 00:48:15,
by the same Spirit;

88
00:48:15,0 --> 00:48:15,0
11 And to

89
00:48:15,0 --> 00:48:15,0
another,

90
00:48:15,0 --> 00:48:15,0
exceedingly great

91
00:48:15,0 --> 00:48:15,0
faith; and to

92
00:48:15,0 --> 00:48:15,0
another, the gifts

93
00:48:15,0 --> 00:48:15,0
of healing by

94
00:48:15,0 --> 00:49:27,
the same Spirit;

95
00:49:27,0 --> 00:49:27,0
12 And

96
00:49:27,0 --> 00:49:27,0
again, to

97
00:49:27,0 --> 00:49:27,0
another, that he

98
00:49:27,0 --> 00:49:27,0
may work

99
00:49:27,0 --> 00:56:57,
mighty miracles;

100
00:56:57,0 --> 00:56:57,0
13 And

101
00:56:57,0 --> 00:56:57,0
again, to

102
00:56:57,0 --> 00:56:57,0
another,

103
00:56:57,0 --> 00:56:57,0
that he

104
00:56:57,0 --> 00:56:57,0
may

105
00:56:57,0 --> 00:56:57,0
prophesy

106
00:56:57,0 --> 00:59:39,
concerning all things;

107
00:59:39,0 --> 00:59:39,0
14 And

108
00:59:39,0 --> 00:59:39,0
again, to

109
00:59:39,0 --> 00:59:39,0


110
00:59:39,0 --> 00:59:39,0
another, the

111
00:59:39,0 --> 00:59:39,0
beholding

112

116
01:04:50,0 --> 01:04:50,0
15 And

117
01:04:50,0 --> 01:04:50,0
again,

118
01:04:50,0 --> 01:04:50,0
to

119

121
01:04:50,0 --> 01:04:22,
