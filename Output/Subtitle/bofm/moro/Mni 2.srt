00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:08,333
Chapter 2 Jesus gave the twelve Nephite disciples

2
00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:16,666
 power to confer the gift of the Holy Ghost. About

3
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:24,999
 A.D. 401–21.

4
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:31,292
1 The words of Christ, which he spake unto his

5
00:00:31,292 --> 00:00:36,625
 disciples, the twelve whom he had chosen, as he laid

6
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:41,958
 his hands upon them

7
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:48,442
2 And he called them by name, saying: Ye shall

8
00:00:48,442 --> 00:00:54,942
 call on the Father in my name, in mighty prayer; and

9
00:00:54,942 --> 00:01:01,442
 after ye have done this ye shall have power that

10
00:01:01,442 --> 00:01:07,942
 to him upon whom ye shall lay your hands, ye shall

11
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:14,442
 give the Holy Ghost; and in my name shall ye give

12
00:01:14,442 --> 00:01:20,942
 it, for thus do mine apostles

13
00:01:20,38 --> 00:01:27,63
3 Now Christ spake these words unto them at the

14
00:01:27,63 --> 00:01:34,88
 time of his first appearing; and the multitude heard

15
00:01:34,88 --> 00:01:42,13
 it not, but the disciples heard it; and on as

16
00:01:42,13 --> 00:01:49,38
 many as they laid their hands, fell the Holy Ghost.
