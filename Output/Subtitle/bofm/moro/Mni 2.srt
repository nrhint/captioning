00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:07,667
Chapter 2 Jesus gave the twelve

2
00:00:07,667 --> 00:00:15,334
Nephite disciples power to confer the gift

3
00:00:15,334 --> 00:00:23,457
of the Holy Ghost. About A.D. 401–21. 

4
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:23,207
1 The words of Christ, which

5
00:00:23,207 --> 00:00:22,957
he spake unto his disciples,

6
00:00:22,957 --> 00:00:22,707
the twelve whom he had chosen,

7
00:00:22,707 --> 00:00:22,523
as he laid his hands upon them—

8
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:22,422
2 And he called them by

9
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:22,323
name, saying: Ye shall call on

10
00:00:22,323 --> 00:00:22,223
the Father in my name, in

11
00:00:22,223 --> 00:00:22,123
mighty prayer; and after ye

12
00:00:22,123 --> 00:00:22,023
have done this ye shall have

13
00:00:22,023 --> 00:00:21,922
power that to him upon whom ye

14
00:00:21,922 --> 00:00:21,823
shall lay your hands, ye

15
00:00:21,823 --> 00:00:21,723
shall give the Holy Ghost; and

16
00:00:21,723 --> 00:00:21,623
in my name shall ye give

17
00:00:21,623 --> 00:00:21,588
it, for thus do mine apostles.

18
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:21,463
3 Now Christ spake these

19
00:00:21,463 --> 00:00:21,338
words unto them at the

20
00:00:21,338 --> 00:00:21,213
time of his first

21
00:00:21,213 --> 00:00:21,088
appearing; and the multitude

22
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:20,963
heard it not, but the

23
00:00:20,963 --> 00:00:20,838
disciples heard it; and on

24
00:00:20,838 --> 00:00:20,713
as many as they laid

25
00:00:20,713 --> 00:00:20,654
their hands, fell the Holy Ghost.
