00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 2 Jesus gave the twelve

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Nephite disciples power to confer the gift

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:03:45,
of the Holy Ghost. About A.D. 401–21. 

4
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
1 The words of Christ, which

5
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
he spake unto his disciples,

6
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
the twelve whom he had chosen,

7
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:17,
as he laid his hands upon them—

8
00:03:17,0 --> 00:03:17,0
2 And he called them by

9
00:03:17,0 --> 00:03:17,0
name, saying: Ye shall call on

10
00:03:17,0 --> 00:03:17,0
the Father in my name, in

11
00:03:17,0 --> 00:03:17,0
mighty prayer; and after ye

12
00:03:17,0 --> 00:03:17,0
have done this ye shall have

13
00:03:17,0 --> 00:03:17,0
power that to him upon whom ye

14
00:03:17,0 --> 00:03:17,0
shall lay your hands, ye

15
00:03:17,0 --> 00:03:17,0
shall give the Holy Ghost; and

16
00:03:17,0 --> 00:03:17,0
in my name shall ye give

17
00:03:17,0 --> 00:09:58,
it, for thus do mine apostles.

18
00:09:58,0 --> 00:09:58,0
3 Now Christ spake these

19
00:09:58,0 --> 00:09:58,0
words unto them at the

20
00:09:58,0 --> 00:09:58,0
time of his first

21
00:09:58,0 --> 00:09:58,0
appearing; and the multitude

22
00:09:58,0 --> 00:09:58,0
heard it not, but the

23
00:09:58,0 --> 00:09:58,0
disciples heard it; and on

24
00:09:58,0 --> 00:09:58,0
as many as they laid

25
00:09:58,0 --> 00:09:30,
their hands, fell the Holy Ghost.
