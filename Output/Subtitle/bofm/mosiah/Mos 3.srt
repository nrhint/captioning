00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,0
Chapter 3 King Benjamin continues his

2
00:00:01,0 --> 00:00:02,0
address—The Lord Omnipotent will minister among men in a

3
00:00:02,0 --> 00:00:03,0
tabernacle of clay—Blood will come from every

4
00:00:03,0 --> 00:00:04,0
pore as He atones for the sins of the world—His is

5
00:00:04,0 --> 00:00:05,0
the only name whereby salvation comes—Men can

6
00:00:05,0 --> 00:00:06,0
put off the natural man and become Saints through

7
00:00:06,0 --> 00:00:07,0
the Atonement—The torment of the wicked will be

8
00:00:07,0 --> 00:00:08,976
as a lake of fire and brimstone. About 124 B.C. 

9
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:12,476
1 And again my brethren, I would call your

10
00:00:12,476 --> 00:00:15,976
attention, for I have somewhat more to

11
00:00:15,976 --> 00:00:19,476
speak unto you; for behold, I have things to

12
00:00:19,476 --> 00:00:22,823
tell you concerning that which is to come.

13
00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:36,573
2 And the things which I shall tell you

14
00:00:36,573 --> 00:00:50,323
are made known unto me by an angel

15
00:00:50,323 --> 00:01:04,073
from God. And he said unto me: Awake; and

16
00:01:04,073 --> 00:01:17,711
I awoke, and behold he stood before me.

17
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:23,211
3 And he said unto me: Awake, and

18
00:01:23,211 --> 00:01:28,711
hear the words which I shall tell

19
00:01:28,711 --> 00:01:34,211
thee; for behold, I am come to declare

20
00:01:34,211 --> 00:01:39,967
unto you the glad tidings of great joy.

21
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:42,681
4 For the Lord hath heard thy

22
00:01:42,681 --> 00:01:45,395
prayers, and hath judged of thy

23
00:01:45,395 --> 00:01:48,109
righteousness, and hath sent me to

24
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:50,823
declare unto thee that thou

25
00:01:50,823 --> 00:01:53,537
mayest rejoice; and that thou

26
00:01:53,537 --> 00:01:56,251
mayest declare unto thy people, that

27
00:01:56,251 --> 00:01:58,318
they may also be filled with joy.

28
00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:58,318
5 For behold, the time cometh,

29
00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:58,318
and is not far distant, that

30
00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:58,318
with power, the Lord Omnipotent

31
00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:58,318
who reigneth, who was, and is

32
00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:58,318
from all eternity to all

33
00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:58,318
eternity, shall come down from heaven

34
00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:58,318
among the children of men, and

35
00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:58,318
shall dwell in a tabernacle of

36
00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:58,318
clay, and shall go forth amongst

37
00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:58,318
men, working mighty miracles,

38
00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:58,318
such as healing the sick,

39
00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:58,318
raising the dead, causing the lame

40
00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:58,318
to walk, the blind to receive

41
00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:58,318
their sight, and the deaf to

42
00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:58,785
hear, and curing all manner of diseases.

43
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:04,535
6 And he shall cast out

44
00:02:04,535 --> 00:02:10,285
devils, or the evil

45
00:02:10,285 --> 00:02:16,035
spirits which dwell in the

46
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:21,074
hearts of the children of men.

47
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:23,801
7 And lo, he shall

48
00:02:23,801 --> 00:02:26,528
suffer temptations, and pain

49
00:02:26,528 --> 00:02:29,255
of body, hunger, thirst,

50
00:02:29,255 --> 00:02:31,982
and fatigue, even more

51
00:02:31,982 --> 00:02:34,709
than man can suffer,

52
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:37,436
except it be unto death;

53
00:02:37,436 --> 00:02:40,163
for behold, blood cometh

54
00:02:40,163 --> 00:02:42,89
from every pore, so great

55
00:02:42,89 --> 00:02:45,617
shall be his anguish

56
00:02:45,617 --> 00:02:48,344
for the wickedness and the

57
00:02:48,344 --> 00:02:51,338
abominations of his people.

58
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:52,088
8 And he shall be

59
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:52,838
called Jesus Christ, the

60
00:02:52,838 --> 00:02:53,588
Son of God, the

61
00:02:53,588 --> 00:02:54,338
Father of heaven and

62
00:02:54,338 --> 00:02:55,088
earth, the Creator of all

63
00:02:55,088 --> 00:02:55,838
things from the

64
00:02:55,838 --> 00:02:56,588
beginning; and his mother

65
00:02:56,588 --> 00:02:57,678
shall be called Mary.

66
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:58,678
9 And lo, he cometh

67
00:02:58,678 --> 00:02:59,678
unto his own, that

68
00:02:59,678 --> 00:03:00,678
salvation might come

69
00:03:00,678 --> 00:03:01,678
unto the children of

70
00:03:01,678 --> 00:03:02,678
men even through

71
00:03:02,678 --> 00:03:03,678
faith on his name; and

72
00:03:03,678 --> 00:03:04,678
even after all this

73
00:03:04,678 --> 00:03:05,678
they shall consider

74
00:03:05,678 --> 00:03:06,678
him a man, and say

75
00:03:06,678 --> 00:03:07,678
that he hath a

76
00:03:07,678 --> 00:03:08,678
devil, and shall scourge

77
00:03:08,678 --> 00:03:09,089
him, and shall crucify him.

78
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:15,289
10 And he shall

79
00:03:15,289 --> 00:03:21,489
rise the third day

80
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:27,689
from the dead; and

81
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:33,889
behold, he standeth to

82
00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:40,089
judge the world;

83
00:03:40,089 --> 00:03:46,289
and behold, all

84
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:52,489
these things are done

85
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:58,689
that a righteous

86
00:03:58,689 --> 00:04:04,889
judgment might come

87
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:11,952
upon the children of men.

88
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:12,043
11 For behold, and

89
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:12,134
also his blood

90
00:04:12,134 --> 00:04:12,225
atoneth for the sins

91
00:04:12,225 --> 00:04:12,316
of those who have

92
00:04:12,316 --> 00:04:12,407
fallen by the

93
00:04:12,407 --> 00:04:12,498
transgression of

94
00:04:12,498 --> 00:04:12,589
Adam, who have died

95
00:04:12,589 --> 00:04:12,68
not knowing the will

96
00:04:12,68 --> 00:04:12,771
of God concerning

97
00:04:12,771 --> 00:04:12,862
them, or who have

98
00:04:12,862 --> 00:04:12,419
ignorantly sinned.

99
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:12,419
12 But wo, wo

100
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:12,419
unto him who

101
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:12,419
knoweth that he

102
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:12,419
rebelleth against

103
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:12,419
God! For salvation

104
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:12,419
cometh to none

105
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:12,419
such except it be

106
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:12,419
through

107
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:12,419
repentance and faith on

108
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:12,886
the Lord Jesus Christ.

109
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:13,295
13 And the Lord

110
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:13,704
God hath sent

111
00:04:13,704 --> 00:04:14,113
his holy

112
00:04:14,113 --> 00:04:14,522
prophets among all

113
00:04:14,522 --> 00:04:14,931
the children of

114
00:04:14,931 --> 00:04:15,34
men, to declare

115
00:04:15,34 --> 00:04:15,749
these things to

116
00:04:15,749 --> 00:04:16,158
every kindred,

117
00:04:16,158 --> 00:04:16,567
nation, and

118
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:16,976
tongue, that

119
00:04:16,976 --> 00:04:17,385
thereby whosoever

120
00:04:17,385 --> 00:04:17,794
should believe

121
00:04:17,794 --> 00:04:18,203
that Christ

122
00:04:18,203 --> 00:04:18,612
should come, the

123
00:04:18,612 --> 00:04:19,021
same might

124
00:04:19,021 --> 00:04:19,43
receive remission of

125
00:04:19,43 --> 00:04:19,839
their sins, and

126
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,248
rejoice with

127
00:04:20,248 --> 00:04:20,657
exceedingly

128
00:04:20,657 --> 00:04:21,066
great joy, even as

129
00:04:21,066 --> 00:04:21,475
though he had

130
00:04:21,475 --> 00:04:21,862
already come among them.

131
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
14 Yet the

132
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
Lord God saw

133
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
that his people

134
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
were a

135
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
stiffnecked

136
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
people, and he

137
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
appointed unto

138
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
them a law,

139
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
even the law of Moses.

140
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
15 And many

141
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
signs, and

142
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
wonders, and

143
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
types, and

144
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
shadows

145
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
showed he unto

146
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
them,

147
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
concerning his

148
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
coming; and also

149
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
holy

150
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
prophets spake unto

151
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
them

152
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
concerning his

153
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
coming; and yet

154
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
they

155
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
hardened their

156
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
hearts, and

157
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
understood not

158
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
that the law

159
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
of Moses

160
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
availeth

161
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
nothing except it

162
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
were

163
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
through the atonement of his blood.

164
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
16 And even

165
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
if it were

166
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
possible

167
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
that little

168
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
children

169
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
could sin

170
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
they could not

171
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
be saved;

172
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
but I say

173
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
unto you

174
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
they are

175
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
blessed; for

176
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
behold, as in

177
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
Adam, or by

178
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
nature,

179
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
they fall,

180
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
even so the

181
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
blood of

182
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
Christ atoneth for their sins.

183
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
17 And

184
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
moreover, I

185
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
say unto

186
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
you, that

187
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
there shall

188
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
be no

189
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
other name

190
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
given nor any

191
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
other way

192
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
nor means

193
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
whereby

194
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
salvation

195
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
can come

196
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
unto the

197
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
children of

198
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
men, only

199
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
in and

200
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
through the

206
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862

208
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862

00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
has been

244
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,862
