00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 3 King Benjamin continues his

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
address—The Lord Omnipotent will minister among men in a

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
tabernacle of clay—Blood will come from every

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
pore as He atones for the sins of the world—His is

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the only name whereby salvation comes—Men can

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
put off the natural man and become Saints through

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Atonement—The torment of the wicked will be

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:11:56,
as a lake of fire and brimstone. About 124 B.C. 

9
00:11:56,0 --> 00:11:56,0
1 And again my brethren, I would call your

10
00:11:56,0 --> 00:11:56,0
attention, for I have somewhat more to

11
00:11:56,0 --> 00:11:56,0
speak unto you; for behold, I have things to

12
00:11:56,0 --> 00:12:10,
tell you concerning that which is to come.

13
00:12:10,0 --> 00:12:10,0
2 And the things which I shall tell you

14
00:12:10,0 --> 00:12:10,0
are made known unto me by an angel

15
00:12:10,0 --> 00:12:10,0
from God. And he said unto me: Awake; and

16
00:12:10,0 --> 00:18:50,
I awoke, and behold he stood before me.

17
00:18:50,0 --> 00:18:50,0
3 And he said unto me: Awake, and

18
00:18:50,0 --> 00:18:50,0
hear the words which I shall tell

19
00:18:50,0 --> 00:18:50,0
thee; for behold, I am come to declare

20
00:18:50,0 --> 00:38:59,
unto you the glad tidings of great joy.

21
00:38:59,0 --> 00:38:59,0
4 For the Lord hath heard thy

22
00:38:59,0 --> 00:38:59,0
prayers, and hath judged of thy

23
00:38:59,0 --> 00:38:59,0
righteousness, and hath sent me to

24
00:38:59,0 --> 00:38:59,0
declare unto thee that thou

25
00:38:59,0 --> 00:38:59,0
mayest rejoice; and that thou

26
00:38:59,0 --> 00:38:59,0
mayest declare unto thy people, that

27
00:38:59,0 --> 00:50:56,
they may also be filled with joy.

28
00:50:56,0 --> 00:50:56,0
5 For behold, the time cometh,

29
00:50:56,0 --> 00:50:56,0
and is not far distant, that

30
00:50:56,0 --> 00:50:56,0
with power, the Lord Omnipotent

31
00:50:56,0 --> 00:50:56,0
who reigneth, who was, and is

32
00:50:56,0 --> 00:50:56,0
from all eternity to all

33
00:50:56,0 --> 00:50:56,0
eternity, shall come down from heaven

34
00:50:56,0 --> 00:50:56,0
among the children of men, and

35
00:50:56,0 --> 00:50:56,0
shall dwell in a tabernacle of

36
00:50:56,0 --> 00:50:56,0
clay, and shall go forth amongst

37
00:50:56,0 --> 00:50:56,0
men, working mighty miracles,

38
00:50:56,0 --> 00:50:56,0
such as healing the sick,

39
00:50:56,0 --> 00:50:56,0
raising the dead, causing the lame

40
00:50:56,0 --> 00:50:56,0
to walk, the blind to receive

41
00:50:56,0 --> 00:50:56,0
their sight, and the deaf to

42
00:50:56,0 --> 00:54:27,
hear, and curing all manner of diseases.

43
00:54:27,0 --> 00:54:27,0
6 And he shall cast out

44
00:54:27,0 --> 00:54:27,0
devils, or the evil

45
00:54:27,0 --> 00:54:27,0
spirits which dwell in the

46
00:54:27,0 --> 00:58:26,
hearts of the children of men.

47
00:58:26,0 --> 00:58:26,0
7 And lo, he shall

48
00:58:26,0 --> 00:58:26,0
suffer temptations, and pain

49
00:58:26,0 --> 00:58:26,0
of body, hunger, thirst,

50
00:58:26,0 --> 00:58:26,0
and fatigue, even more

51
00:58:26,0 --> 00:58:26,0
than man can suffer,

52
00:58:26,0 --> 00:58:26,0
except it be unto death;

53
00:58:26,0 --> 00:58:26,0
for behold, blood cometh

54
00:58:26,0 --> 00:58:26,0
from every pore, so great

55
00:58:26,0 --> 00:58:26,0
shall be his anguish

56
00:58:26,0 --> 00:58:26,0
for the wickedness and the

57
00:58:26,0 --> 00:58:56,
abominations of his people.

58
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
8 And he shall be

59
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
called Jesus Christ, the

60
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
Son of God, the

61
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
Father of heaven and

62
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
earth, the Creator of all

63
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
things from the

64
00:58:56,0 --> 00:58:56,0
beginning; and his mother

65
00:58:56,0 --> 00:59:26,
shall be called Mary.

66
00:59:26,0 --> 00:59:26,0
9 And lo, he cometh

67
00:59:26,0 --> 00:59:26,0
unto his own, that

68
00:59:26,0 --> 00:59:26,0
salvation might come

69
00:59:26,0 --> 00:59:26,0
unto the children of

70
00:59:26,0 --> 00:59:26,0
men even through

71
00:59:26,0 --> 00:59:26,0
faith on his name; and

72
00:59:26,0 --> 00:59:26,0
even after all this

73
00:59:26,0 --> 00:59:26,0
they shall consider

74
00:59:26,0 --> 00:59:26,0
him a man, and say

75
00:59:26,0 --> 00:59:26,0
that he hath a

76
00:59:26,0 --> 00:59:26,0
devil, and shall scourge

77
00:59:26,0 --> 01:03:38,
him, and shall crucify him.

78
01:03:38,0 --> 01:03:38,0
10 And he shall

79
01:03:38,0 --> 01:03:38,0
rise the third day

80
01:03:38,0 --> 01:03:38,0
from the dead; and

81
01:03:38,0 --> 01:03:38,0
behold, he standeth to

82
01:03:38,0 --> 01:03:38,0
judge the world;

83
01:03:38,0 --> 01:03:38,0
and behold, all

84
01:03:38,0 --> 01:03:38,0
these things are done

85
01:03:38,0 --> 01:03:38,0
that a righteous

86
01:03:38,0 --> 01:03:38,0
judgment might come

87
01:03:38,0 --> 01:04:50,
upon the children of men.

88
01:04:50,0 --> 01:04:50,0
11 For behold, and

89
01:04:50,0 --> 01:04:50,0
also his blood

90
01:04:50,0 --> 01:04:50,0
atoneth for the sins

91
01:04:50,0 --> 01:04:50,0
of those who have

92
01:04:50,0 --> 01:04:50,0
fallen by the

93
01:04:50,0 --> 01:04:50,0
transgression of

94
01:04:50,0 --> 01:04:50,0
Adam, who have died

95
01:04:50,0 --> 01:04:50,0
not knowing the will

96
01:04:50,0 --> 01:04:50,0
of God concerning

97
01:04:50,0 --> 01:04:50,0
them, or who have

98
01:04:50,0 --> 01:10:18,
ignorantly sinned.

99
01:10:18,0 --> 01:10:18,0
12 But wo, wo

100
01:10:18,0 --> 01:10:18,0
unto him who

101
01:10:18,0 --> 01:10:18,0
knoweth that he

102
01:10:18,0 --> 01:10:18,0
rebelleth against

103
01:10:18,0 --> 01:10:18,0
God! For salvation

104
01:10:18,0 --> 01:10:18,0
cometh to none

105
01:10:18,0 --> 01:10:18,0
such except it be

106
01:10:18,0 --> 01:10:18,0
through

107
01:10:18,0 --> 01:10:18,0
repentance and faith on

108
01:10:18,0 --> 01:27:11,
the Lord Jesus Christ.

109
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
13 And the Lord

110
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
God hath sent

111
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
his holy

112
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
prophets among all

113
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
the children of

114
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
men, to declare

115
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
these things to

116
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
every kindred,

117
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
nation, and

118
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
tongue, that

119
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
thereby whosoever

120
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
should believe

121
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
that Christ

122
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
should come, the

123
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
same might

124
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
receive remission of

125
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
their sins, and

126
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
rejoice with

127
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
exceedingly

128
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
great joy, even as

129
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
though he had

130
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,
already come among them.

131
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
14 Yet the

132
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
Lord God saw

133
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
that his people

134
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
were a

135
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
stiffnecked

136
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
people, and he

137
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
appointed unto

138
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
them a law,

139
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,
even the law of Moses.

140
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
15 And many

141
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
signs, and

142
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
wonders, and

143
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
types, and

144
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
shadows

145
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
showed he unto

146
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
them,

147
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
concerning his

148
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
coming; and also

149
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
holy

150
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
prophets spake unto

151
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
them

152
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
concerning his

153
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
coming; and yet

154
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
they

155
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
hardened their

156
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
hearts, and

157
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
understood not

158
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
that the law

159
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
of Moses

160
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
availeth

161
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
nothing except it

162
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
were

163
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,
through the atonement of his blood.

164
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
16 And even

165
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
if it were

166
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
possible

167
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
that little

168
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
children

169
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
could sin

170
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
they could not

171
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
be saved;

172
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
but I say

173
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
unto you

174
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
they are

175
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
blessed; for

176
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
behold, as in

177
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
Adam, or by

178
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
nature,

179
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
they fall,

180
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
even so the

181
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
blood of

182
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,
Christ atoneth for their sins.

183
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
17 And

184
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
moreover, I

185
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
say unto

186
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
you, that

187
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
there shall

188
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
be no

189
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
other name

190
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
given nor any

191
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
other way

192
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
nor means

193
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
whereby

194
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
salvation

195
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
can come

196
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
unto the

197
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
children of

198
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
men, only

199
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
in and

200
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
through the

201
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
name of

202
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,
Christ, the Lord Omnipotent.

203
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
18 For

204
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
behold he

205
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
judgeth,

206
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
and his

207
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
judgment is

208
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
just;

209
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
and the

210
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
infant

211
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
perisheth not

212
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
that

213
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
dieth in his

214
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
infancy;

215
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
but men

216
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
drink

217
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
damnation to

218
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
their own

219
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
souls

220
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
except they

221
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
humble

222
