00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:10,0
Chapter 3 King Benjamin continues his address—The

2
00:00:10,0 --> 00:00:20,0
 Lord Omnipotent will minister among men in a

3
00:00:20,0 --> 00:00:30,0
 tabernacle of clay—Blood will come from every pore as

4
00:00:30,0 --> 00:00:40,0
 He atones for the sins of the world—His is the only

5
00:00:40,0 --> 00:00:50,0
 name whereby salvation comes—Men can put off the

6
00:00:50,0 --> 00:01:00,0
 natural man and become Saints through the

7
00:01:00,0 --> 00:01:10,0
 Atonement—The torment of the wicked will be as a lake of

8
00:01:10,0 --> 00:01:20,0
 fire and brimstone. About 124 B.C.

9
00:01:20,18 --> 00:01:26,18
1 And again my brethren, I would call your

10
00:01:26,18 --> 00:01:32,18
 attention, for I have somewhat more to speak unto you;

11
00:01:32,18 --> 00:01:38,18
 for behold, I have things to tell you concerning

12
00:01:38,18 --> 00:01:44,18
 that which is to come

13
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:48,854
2 And the things which I shall tell you are made

14
00:01:48,854 --> 00:01:53,604
 known unto me by an angel from God. And he said

15
00:01:53,604 --> 00:01:58,354
 unto me: Awake; and I awoke, and behold he stood

16
00:01:58,354 --> 00:02:03,104
 before me

17
00:02:03,39 --> 00:02:10,39
3 And he said unto me: Awake, and hear the words

18
00:02:10,39 --> 00:02:17,39
 which I shall tell thee; for behold, I am come to

19
00:02:17,39 --> 00:02:24,39
 declare unto you the glad tidings of great joy

20
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:31,511
4 For the Lord hath heard thy prayers, and hath

21
00:02:31,511 --> 00:02:38,311
 judged of thy righteousness, and hath sent me to

22
00:02:38,311 --> 00:02:45,111
 declare unto thee that thou mayest rejoice; and that

23
00:02:45,111 --> 00:02:51,911
 thou mayest declare unto thy people, that they may

24
00:02:51,911 --> 00:02:58,711
 also be filled with joy

25
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:05,678
5 For behold, the time cometh, and is not far

26
00:03:05,678 --> 00:03:13,078
 distant, that with power, the Lord Omnipotent who

27
00:03:13,078 --> 00:03:20,478
 reigneth, who was, and is from all eternity to all

28
00:03:20,478 --> 00:03:27,878
 eternity, shall come down from heaven among the

29
00:03:27,878 --> 00:03:35,278
 children of men, and shall dwell in a tabernacle of

30
00:03:35,278 --> 00:03:42,678
 clay, and shall go forth amongst men, working mighty

31
00:03:42,678 --> 00:03:50,078
 miracles, such as healing the sick, raising the

32
00:03:50,078 --> 00:03:57,478
 dead, causing the lame to walk, the blind to receive

33
00:03:57,478 --> 00:04:04,878
 their sight, and the deaf to hear, and curing all

34
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:12,278
 manner of diseases

35
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:17,786
6 And he shall cast out devils, or the evil

36
00:04:17,786 --> 00:04:22,786
 spirits which dwell in the hearts of the children of

37
00:04:22,786 --> 00:04:27,786
 men

38
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:34,067
7 And lo, he shall suffer temptations, and pain of

39
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:41,067
 body, hunger, thirst, and fatigue, even more than

40
00:04:41,067 --> 00:04:48,067
 man can suffer, except it be unto death; for

41
00:04:48,067 --> 00:04:55,067
 behold, blood cometh from every pore, so great shall

42
00:04:55,067 --> 00:05:02,067
 be his anguish for the wickedness and the

43
00:05:02,067 --> 00:05:09,067
 abominations of his people

44
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:18,343
8 And he shall be called Jesus Christ, the Son of

45
00:05:18,343 --> 00:05:26,843
 God, the Father of heaven and earth, the Creator

46
00:05:26,843 --> 00:05:35,343
 of all things from the beginning; and his mother

47
00:05:35,343 --> 00:05:43,843
 shall be called Mary

48
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:50,576
9 And lo, he cometh unto his own, that salvation

49
00:05:50,576 --> 00:05:57,976
 might come unto the children of men even through

50
00:05:57,976 --> 00:06:05,376
 faith on his name; and even after all this they

51
00:06:05,376 --> 00:06:12,776
 shall consider him a man, and say that he hath a

52
00:06:12,776 --> 00:06:20,176
 devil, and shall scourge him, and shall crucify him

53
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:27,213
10 And he shall rise the third day from the dead;

54
00:06:27,213 --> 00:06:34,213
 and behold, he standeth to judge the world; and

55
00:06:34,213 --> 00:06:41,213
 behold, all these things are done that a righteous

56
00:06:41,213 --> 00:06:48,213
 judgment might come upon the children of men

57
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:56,258
11 For behold, and also his blood atoneth for the

58
00:06:56,258 --> 00:07:04,008
 sins of those who have fallen by the transgression

59
00:07:04,008 --> 00:07:11,758
 of Adam, who have died not knowing the will of

60
00:07:11,758 --> 00:07:19,508
 God concerning them, or who have ignorantly sinned

61
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:25,806
12 But wo, wo unto him who knoweth that he

62
00:07:25,806 --> 00:07:32,306
 rebelleth against God! For salvation cometh to none such

63
00:07:32,306 --> 00:07:38,806
 except it be through repentance and faith on the

64
00:07:38,806 --> 00:07:45,306
 Lord Jesus Christ

65
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:52,656
13 And the Lord God hath sent his holy prophets

66
00:07:52,656 --> 00:07:59,513
 among all the children of men, to declare these

67
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:06,37
 things to every kindred, nation, and tongue, that

68
00:08:06,37 --> 00:08:13,227
 thereby whosoever should believe that Christ should

69
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:20,084
 come, the same might receive remission of their

70
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:26,941
 sins, and rejoice with exceedingly great joy, even as

71
00:08:26,941 --> 00:08:33,798
 though he had already come among them

72
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:39,979
14 Yet the Lord God saw that his people were a

73
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:46,312
 stiffnecked people, and he appointed unto them a law,

74
00:08:46,312 --> 00:08:52,645
 even the law of Moses

75
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:57,889
15 And many signs, and wonders, and types, and

76
00:08:57,889 --> 00:09:03,746
 shadows showed he unto them, concerning his coming;

77
00:09:03,746 --> 00:09:09,603
 and also holy prophets spake unto them concerning

78
00:09:09,603 --> 00:09:15,46
 his coming; and yet they hardened their hearts, and

79
00:09:15,46 --> 00:09:21,317
 understood not that the law of Moses availeth

80
00:09:21,317 --> 00:09:27,174
 nothing except it were through the atonement of his

81
00:09:27,174 --> 00:09:33,031
 blood

82
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:39,539
16 And even if it were possible that little

83
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:45,939
 children could sin they could not be saved; but I say

84
00:09:45,939 --> 00:09:52,339
 unto you they are blessed; for behold, as in Adam,

85
00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:58,739
 or by nature, they fall, even so the blood of

86
00:09:58,739 --> 00:10:05,139
 Christ atoneth for their sins

87
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:11,038
17 And moreover, I say unto you, that there shall

88
00:10:11,038 --> 00:10:16,638
 be no other name given nor any other way nor means

89
00:10:16,638 --> 00:10:22,238
 whereby salvation can come unto the children of

90
00:10:22,238 --> 00:10:27,838
 men, only in and through the name of Christ, the

91
00:10:27,838 --> 00:10:33,438
 Lord Omnipotent

92
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:40,824
18 For behold he judgeth, and his judgment is

93
00:10:40,824 --> 00:10:47,681
 just; and the infant perisheth not that dieth in his

94
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:54,538
 infancy; but men drink damnation to their own souls

95
00:10:54,538 --> 00:11:01,395
 except they humble themselves and become as

96
00:11:01,395 --> 00:11:08,252
 little children, and believe that salvation was, and

97
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:15,109
 is, and is to come, in and through the atoning blood

98
00:11:15,109 --> 00:11:21,966
 of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent

99
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:28,248
19 For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has

100
00:11:28,248 --> 00:11:34,548
 been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever

101
00:11:34,548 --> 00:11:40,848
 and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the

102
00:11:40,848 --> 00:11:47,148
 Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and

103
00:11:47,148 --> 00:11:53,448
 becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ

104
00:11:53,448 --> 00:11:59,748
 the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive,

105
00:11:59,748 --> 00:12:06,048
 meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit

106
00:12:06,048 --> 00:12:12,348
 to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict

107
00:12:12,348 --> 00:12:18,648
 upon him, even as a child doth submit to his

108
00:12:18,648 --> 00:12:24,948
 father

109
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:30,077
20 And moreover, I say unto you, that the time

110
00:12:30,077 --> 00:12:36,077
 shall come when the knowledge of a Savior shall

111
00:12:36,077 --> 00:12:42,077
 spread throughout every nation, kindred, tongue, and

112
00:12:42,077 --> 00:12:48,077
 people

113
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:55,701
21 And behold, when that time cometh, none shall

114
00:12:55,701 --> 00:13:03,201
 be found blameless before God, except it be little

115
00:13:03,201 --> 00:13:10,701
 children, only through repentance and faith on the

116
00:13:10,701 --> 00:13:18,201
 name of the Lord God Omnipotent

117
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:24,464
22 And even at this time, when thou shalt have

118
00:13:24,464 --> 00:13:30,464
 taught thy people the things which the Lord thy God

119
00:13:30,464 --> 00:13:36,464
 hath commanded thee, even then are they found no

120
00:13:36,464 --> 00:13:42,464
 more blameless in the sight of God, only according

121
00:13:42,464 --> 00:13:48,464
 to the words which I have spoken unto thee

122
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:54,494
23 And now I have spoken the words which the Lord

123
00:13:54,494 --> 00:14:00,494
 God hath commanded me

124
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:06,273
24 And thus saith the Lord: They shall stand as a

125
00:14:06,273 --> 00:14:12,473
 bright testimony against this people, at the

126
00:14:12,473 --> 00:14:18,673
 judgment day; whereof they shall be judged, every man

127
00:14:18,673 --> 00:14:24,873
 according to his works, whether they be good, or

128
00:14:24,873 --> 00:14:31,073
 whether they be evil

129
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:39,138
25 And if they be evil they are consigned to an

130
00:14:39,138 --> 00:14:46,305
 awful view of their own guilt and abominations,

131
00:14:46,305 --> 00:14:53,472
 which doth cause them to shrink from the presence of

132
00:14:53,472 --> 00:15:00,639
 the Lord into a state of misery and endless

133
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:07,806
 torment, from whence they can no more return; therefore

134
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:14,973
 they have drunk damnation to their own souls

135
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:20,314
26 Therefore, they have drunk out of the cup of

136
00:15:20,314 --> 00:15:25,981
 the wrath of God, which justice could no more deny

137
00:15:25,981 --> 00:15:31,648
 unto them than it could deny that Adam should fall

138
00:15:31,648 --> 00:15:37,315
 because of his partaking of the forbidden fruit;

139
00:15:37,315 --> 00:15:42,982
 therefore, mercy could have claim on them no more

140
00:15:42,982 --> 00:15:48,649
 forever

141
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,097
27 And their torment is as a lake of fire and

142
00:15:50,097 --> 00:15:51,847
 brimstone, whose flames are unquenchable, and whose

143
00:15:51,847 --> 00:15:53,597
 smoke ascendeth up forever and ever. Thus hath the

144
00:15:53,597 --> 00:15:55,347
 Lord commanded me. Amen.
