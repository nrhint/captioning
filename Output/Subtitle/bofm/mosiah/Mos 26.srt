1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 26 Many members of the Church are led

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
into sin by unbelievers—Alma is promised

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
eternal life—Those who repent and are baptized gain

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
forgiveness—Church members in sin who repent

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and confess to Alma and to the Lord will be

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
forgiven; otherwise, they will not be numbered

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:06:55,
among the people of the Church. About 120–100 B.C. 

8
00:06:55,0 --> 00:06:55,0
1 Now it came to pass that there were

9
00:06:55,0 --> 00:06:55,0
many of the rising generation that could

10
00:06:55,0 --> 00:06:55,0
not understand the words of king

11
00:06:55,0 --> 00:06:55,0
Benjamin, being little children at the time

12
00:06:55,0 --> 00:06:55,0
he spake unto his people; and they did

13
00:06:55,0 --> 00:17:48,
not believe the tradition of their fathers.

14
00:17:48,0 --> 00:17:48,0
2 They did not believe what had

15
00:17:48,0 --> 00:17:48,0
been said concerning the resurrection

16
00:17:48,0 --> 00:17:48,0
of the dead, neither did they

17
00:17:48,0 --> 00:29:59,
believe concerning the coming of Christ.

18
00:29:59,0 --> 00:29:59,0
3 And now because of their

19
00:29:59,0 --> 00:29:59,0
unbelief they could not

20
00:29:59,0 --> 00:29:59,0
understand the word of God;

21
00:29:59,0 --> 00:32:55,
and their hearts were hardened.

22
00:32:55,0 --> 00:32:55,0
4 And they would not be

23
00:32:55,0 --> 00:32:55,0
baptized; neither would they

24
00:32:55,0 --> 00:32:55,0
join the church. And they

25
00:32:55,0 --> 00:32:55,0
were a separate people as

26
00:32:55,0 --> 00:32:55,0
to their faith, and

27
00:32:55,0 --> 00:32:55,0
remained so ever after, even in

28
00:32:55,0 --> 00:32:55,0
their carnal and sinful

29
00:32:55,0 --> 00:32:55,0
state; for they would not

30
00:32:55,0 --> 00:38:05,
call upon the Lord their God.

31
00:38:05,0 --> 00:38:05,0
5 And now in the reign

32
00:38:05,0 --> 00:38:05,0
of Mosiah they were not

33
00:38:05,0 --> 00:38:05,0
half so numerous as

34
00:38:05,0 --> 00:38:05,0
the people of God; but

35
00:38:05,0 --> 00:38:05,0
because of the

36
00:38:05,0 --> 00:38:05,0
dissensions among the brethren

37
00:38:05,0 --> 00:45:13,
they became more numerous.

38
00:45:13,0 --> 00:45:13,0
6 For it came to pass

39
00:45:13,0 --> 00:45:13,0
that they did

40
00:45:13,0 --> 00:45:13,0
deceive many with their

41
00:45:13,0 --> 00:45:13,0
flattering words, who

42
00:45:13,0 --> 00:45:13,0
were in the church, and

43
00:45:13,0 --> 00:45:13,0
did cause them to

44
00:45:13,0 --> 00:45:13,0
commit many sins;

45
00:45:13,0 --> 00:45:13,0
therefore it became

46
00:45:13,0 --> 00:45:13,0
expedient that those who

47
00:45:13,0 --> 00:45:13,0
committed sin, that

48
00:45:13,0 --> 00:45:13,0
were in the church,

49
00:45:13,0 --> 00:47:25,
should be admonished by the church.

50
00:47:25,0 --> 00:47:25,0
7 And it came to

51
00:47:25,0 --> 00:47:25,0
pass that they were

52
00:47:25,0 --> 00:47:25,0
brought before the

53
00:47:25,0 --> 00:47:25,0
priests, and delivered

54
00:47:25,0 --> 00:47:25,0
up unto the priests

55
00:47:25,0 --> 00:47:25,0
by the teachers; and

56
00:47:25,0 --> 00:47:25,0
the priests brought

57
00:47:25,0 --> 00:47:25,0
them before Alma,

58
00:47:25,0 --> 00:51:23,
who was the high priest.

59
00:51:23,0 --> 00:51:23,0
8 Now king

60
00:51:23,0 --> 00:51:23,0
Mosiah had given

61
00:51:23,0 --> 00:51:23,0
Alma the

62
00:51:23,0 --> 00:53:07,
authority over the church.

63
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
9 And it came

64
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
to pass that

65
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
Alma did not

66
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
know concerning

67
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
them; but

68
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
there were many

69
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
witnesses

70
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
against them; yea,

71
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
the people

72
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
stood and

73
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
testified of their

74
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,
iniquity in abundance.

75
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
10 Now there

76
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
had not any

77
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
such thing

78
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
happened before in

79
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
the church;

80
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
therefore Alma

81
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
was troubled in

82
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
his spirit,

83
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
and he caused

84
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
that they should

85
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
be brought

86
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,
before the king.

87
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
11 And he

88
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
said unto the

89
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
king: Behold,

90
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
here are many

91
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
whom we have

92
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
brought

93
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
before thee, who

94
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
are accused of

95
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
their

96
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
brethren; yea, and

97
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
they have

98
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
been taken in

99
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
divers

100
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
iniquities. And they

101
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
do not repent

102
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
of their

103
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
iniquities;

104
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
therefore we have

105
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
brought them

106
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
before thee,

107
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
that thou

108
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
mayest judge

109
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,
them according to their crimes.

110
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
12 But king

111
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
Mosiah said

112
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
unto Alma:

113
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
Behold, I

114
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
judge them not;

115
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
therefore I

116
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
deliver

117
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
them into thy

118
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,
hands to be judged.

119
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
13 And now

120
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
the spirit

121
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
of Alma was

122
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
again

123
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
troubled; and

124
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
he went and

125
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
inquired of

126
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
the Lord

127
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
what he

128
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
should do

129
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
concerning this

130
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
matter, for

131
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
he feared

132
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
that he

133
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
should do

134
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,
wrong in the sight of God.

135
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
14 And it

136
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
came to

137
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
pass that

138
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
after he had

139
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
poured

140
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
out his

141
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
whole soul to

142
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
God, the

143
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
voice of

144
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
the Lord

145
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,
came to him, saying:

146
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
15 Blessed

147
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
art thou,

148
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
Alma, and

149
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
blessed

150
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
are they

151
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
who were

152
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
baptized in

153
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
the waters

154
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
of Mormon.

155
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
Thou art

156
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
blessed

157
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
because of

158
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
thy

159
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
exceeding faith

160
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
in the

161
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
words alone of

162
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
my

163
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,
servant Abinadi.

164
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
16 And

165
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
blessed are

166
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
they

167
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
because of

168
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
their

169
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
exceeding

170
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
faith in the

171
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
words

172
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
alone which

173
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
thou

174
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,
hast spoken unto them.

175
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
17 And

176
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
blessed

177
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
art thou

178
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
because

179
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
thou

180
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
hast

181
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
established a

182
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
church

183
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
among

184
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
this

185
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
people; and

186
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
they shall

187
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
be

188
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
established,

189
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
and

190
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,
they shall be my people.

191
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
18 Yea,

192
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0


193
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
blessed is

194
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
this

195
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
people who

196
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
are

197
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
willing to

198
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
bear

199
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
my name;

200
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
for in

201
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
my

202
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
name shall

00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
they

204
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
be

205
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,
called; and they are mine.

206
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
19 And

207
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0


208
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
because

209
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
thou hast

210
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0


211
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
inquired of

212
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
me

213
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0


214
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
concerning the

215
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0


216
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0


217
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
transgressor,

218
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,
thou art blessed.

219
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
20

220
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
Thou art

221
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
my

222
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
servant;

223
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
and I

224
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0


225
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
covenant

226
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
with thee

227
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
that

228
00:53:07,0 --> 00:53:07,0
