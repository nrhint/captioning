00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,0
Chapter 26 Many members of the Church are led into

2
00:00:01,0 --> 00:00:02,0
 sin by unbelievers—Alma is promised eternal

3
00:00:02,0 --> 00:00:03,0
 life—Those who repent and are baptized gain

4
00:00:03,0 --> 00:00:04,0
 forgiveness—Church members in sin who repent and confess to

5
00:00:04,0 --> 00:00:05,0
 Alma and to the Lord will be forgiven; otherwise,

6
00:00:05,0 --> 00:00:06,0
 they will not be numbered among the people of the

7
00:00:06,0 --> 00:00:07,0
 Church. About 120–100 B.C.

8
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,575
1 Now it came to pass that there were many of the

9
00:00:09,575 --> 00:00:11,175
 rising generation that could not understand the

10
00:00:11,175 --> 00:00:12,775
 words of king Benjamin, being little children at the

11
00:00:12,775 --> 00:00:14,375
 time he spake unto his people; and they did not

12
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:15,975
 believe the tradition of their fathers

13
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,616
2 They did not believe what had been said

14
00:00:18,616 --> 00:00:21,283
 concerning the resurrection of the dead, neither did they

15
00:00:21,283 --> 00:00:23,95
 believe concerning the coming of Christ

16
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:26,591
3 And now because of their unbelief they could not

17
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:29,258
 understand the word of God; and their hearts were

18
00:00:29,258 --> 00:00:31,925
 hardened

19
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,499
4 And they would not be baptized; neither would

20
00:00:33,499 --> 00:00:35,099
 they join the church. And they were a separate

21
00:00:35,099 --> 00:00:36,699
 people as to their faith, and remained so ever after,

22
00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:38,299
 even in their carnal and sinful state; for they

23
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:39,899
 would not call upon the Lord their God

24
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,873
5 And now in the reign of Mosiah they were not

25
00:00:41,873 --> 00:00:43,873
 half so numerous as the people of God; but because of

26
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:45,873
 the dissensions among the brethren they became

27
00:00:45,873 --> 00:00:47,873
 more numerous

28
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,181
6 For it came to pass that they did deceive many

29
00:00:49,181 --> 00:00:50,514
 with their flattering words, who were in the

30
00:00:50,514 --> 00:00:51,847
 church, and did cause them to commit many sins;

31
00:00:51,847 --> 00:00:53,18
 therefore it became expedient that those who committed

32
00:00:53,18 --> 00:00:54,513
 sin, that were in the church, should be admonished by

33
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:55,846
 the church

34
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,822
7 And it came to pass that they were brought

35
00:00:57,822 --> 00:00:59,822
 before the priests, and delivered up unto the priests

36
00:00:59,822 --> 00:01:01,822
 by the teachers; and the priests brought them

37
00:01:01,822 --> 00:01:03,822
 before Alma, who was the high priest

38
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:07,797
8 Now king Mosiah had given Alma the authority

39
00:01:07,797 --> 00:01:11,797
 over the church

40
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:13,772
9 And it came to pass that Alma did not know

41
00:01:13,772 --> 00:01:15,772
 concerning them; but there were many witnesses against

42
00:01:15,772 --> 00:01:17,772
 them; yea, the people stood and testified of their

43
00:01:17,772 --> 00:01:19,772
 iniquity in abundance

44
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,746
10 Now there had not any such thing happened

45
00:01:21,746 --> 00:01:23,746
 before in the church; therefore Alma was troubled in

46
00:01:23,746 --> 00:01:25,746
 his spirit, and he caused that they should be

47
00:01:25,746 --> 00:01:27,746
 brought before the king

48
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:28,864
11 And he said unto the king: Behold, here are

49
00:01:28,864 --> 00:01:30,007
 many whom we have brought before thee, who are

50
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:31,15
 accused of their brethren; yea, and they have been taken

51
00:01:31,15 --> 00:01:32,293
 in divers iniquities. And they do not repent of

52
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:33,436
 their iniquities; therefore we have brought them

53
00:01:33,436 --> 00:01:34,579
 before thee, that thou mayest judge them according

54
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:35,722
 to their crimes

55
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:38,363
12 But king Mosiah said unto Alma: Behold, I judge

56
00:01:38,363 --> 00:01:41,03
 them not; therefore I deliver them into thy hands

57
00:01:41,03 --> 00:01:43,697
 to be judged

58
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:47,67
13 And now the spirit of Alma was again troubled;

59
00:01:47,67 --> 00:01:51,67
 and he went and inquired of the Lord what he

60
00:01:51,67 --> 00:01:55,67
 should do concerning this matter, for he feared that he

61
00:01:55,67 --> 00:01:59,67
 should do wrong in the sight of God

62
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:02,287
14 And it came to pass that after he had poured

63
00:02:02,287 --> 00:02:04,954
 out his whole soul to God, the voice of the Lord

64
00:02:04,954 --> 00:02:07,621
 came to him, saying

65
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,594
15 Blessed art thou, Alma, and blessed are they

66
00:02:09,594 --> 00:02:11,594
 who were baptized in the waters of Mormon. Thou art

67
00:02:11,594 --> 00:02:13,594
 blessed because of thy exceeding faith in the

68
00:02:13,594 --> 00:02:15,594
 words alone of my servant Abinadi

69
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:18,236
16 And blessed are they because of their exceeding

70
00:02:18,236 --> 00:02:20,903
 faith in the words alone which thou hast spoken

71
00:02:20,903 --> 00:02:23,57
 unto them

72
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:26,21
17 And blessed art thou because thou hast

73
00:02:26,21 --> 00:02:28,877
 established a church among this people; and they shall be

74
00:02:28,877 --> 00:02:31,544
 established, and they shall be my people

75
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:34,185
18 Yea, blessed is this people who are willing to

76
00:02:34,185 --> 00:02:36,852
 bear my name; for in my name shall they be called;

77
00:02:36,852 --> 00:02:39,519
 and they are mine

78
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:43,493
19 And because thou hast inquired of me concerning

79
00:02:43,493 --> 00:02:47,493
 the transgressor, thou art blessed

80
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:51,467
20 Thou art my servant; and I covenant with thee

81
00:02:51,467 --> 00:02:55,467
 that thou shalt have eternal life; and thou shalt

82
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:59,467
 serve me and go forth in my name, and shalt gather

83
00:02:59,467 --> 00:03:03,467
 together my sheep

84
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:06,084
21 And he that will hear my voice shall be my

85
00:03:06,084 --> 00:03:08,751
 sheep; and him shall ye receive into the church, and

86
00:03:08,751 --> 00:03:11,418
 him will I also receive

87
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,391
22 For behold, this is my church; whosoever is

88
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:15,391
 baptized shall be baptized unto repentance. And

89
00:03:15,391 --> 00:03:17,391
 whomsoever ye receive shall believe in my name; and him

90
00:03:17,391 --> 00:03:19,391
 will I freely forgive

91
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,366
23 For it is I that taketh upon me the sins of the

92
00:03:21,366 --> 00:03:23,366
 world; for it is I that hath created them; and it

93
00:03:23,366 --> 00:03:25,366
 is I that granteth unto him that believeth unto

94
00:03:25,366 --> 00:03:27,366
 the end a place at my right hand

95
00:03:27,34 --> 00:03:30,007
24 For behold, in my name are they called; and if

96
00:03:30,007 --> 00:03:32,674
 they know me they shall come forth, and shall have

97
00:03:32,674 --> 00:03:35,341
 a place eternally at my right hand

98
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,982
25 And it shall come to pass that when the second

99
00:03:37,982 --> 00:03:40,649
 trump shall sound then shall they that never knew

100
00:03:40,649 --> 00:03:43,316
 me come forth and shall stand before me

101
00:03:43,29 --> 00:03:45,957
26 And then shall they know that I am the Lord

102
00:03:45,957 --> 00:03:48,624
 their God, that I am their Redeemer; but they would

103
00:03:48,624 --> 00:03:51,291
 not be redeemed

104
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,931
27 And then I will confess unto them that I never

105
00:03:53,931 --> 00:03:56,598
 knew them; and they shall depart into everlasting

106
00:03:56,598 --> 00:03:59,265
 fire prepared for the devil and his angels

107
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,239
28 Therefore I say unto you, that he that will not

108
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:07,239
 hear my voice, the same shall ye not receive into

109
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:11,239
 my church, for him I will not receive at the last

110
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:15,239
 day

111
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,521
29 Therefore I say unto you, Go; and whosoever

112
00:04:16,521 --> 00:04:17,854
 transgresseth against me, him shall ye judge

113
00:04:17,854 --> 00:04:19,187
 according to the sins which he has committed; and if he

114
00:04:19,187 --> 00:04:20,52
 confess his sins before thee and me, and repenteth

115
00:04:20,52 --> 00:04:21,853
 in the sincerity of his heart, him shall ye

116
00:04:21,853 --> 00:04:23,186
 forgive, and I will forgive him also

117
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:27,163
30 Yea, and as often as my people repent will I

118
00:04:27,163 --> 00:04:31,163
 forgive them their trespasses against me

119
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:34,338
31 And ye shall also forgive one another your

120
00:04:34,338 --> 00:04:37,538
 trespasses; for verily I say unto you, he that

121
00:04:37,538 --> 00:04:40,738
 forgiveth not his neighbor’s trespasses when he says that

122
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:43,938
 he repents, the same hath brought himself under

123
00:04:43,938 --> 00:04:47,138
 condemnation

124
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,087
32 Now I say unto you, Go; and whosoever will not

125
00:04:49,087 --> 00:04:51,087
 repent of his sins the same shall not be numbered

126
00:04:51,087 --> 00:04:53,087
 among my people; and this shall be observed from

127
00:04:53,087 --> 00:04:55,087
 this time forward

128
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,061
33 And it came to pass when Alma had heard these

129
00:04:57,061 --> 00:04:59,061
 words he wrote them down that he might have them,

130
00:04:59,061 --> 00:05:01,061
 and that he might judge the people of that church

131
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:03,061
 according to the commandments of God

132
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,703
34 And it came to pass that Alma went and judged

133
00:05:05,703 --> 00:05:08,37
 those that had been taken in iniquity, according to

134
00:05:08,37 --> 00:05:11,037
 the word of the Lord

135
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:13,344
35 And whosoever repented of their sins and did

136
00:05:13,344 --> 00:05:15,677
 confess them, them he did number among the people of

137
00:05:15,677 --> 00:05:18,01
 the church

138
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,985
36 And those that would not confess their sins and

139
00:05:20,985 --> 00:05:22,985
 repent of their iniquity, the same were not

140
00:05:22,985 --> 00:05:24,985
 numbered among the people of the church, and their

141
00:05:24,985 --> 00:05:26,985
 names were blotted out

142
00:05:26,96 --> 00:05:28,56
37 And it came to pass that Alma did regulate all

143
00:05:28,56 --> 00:05:30,16
 the affairs of the church; and they began again to

144
00:05:30,16 --> 00:05:31,76
 have peace and to prosper exceedingly in the

145
00:05:31,76 --> 00:05:33,36
 affairs of the church, walking circumspectly before

146
00:05:33,36 --> 00:05:34,96
 God, receiving many, and baptizing many

147
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:37,602
38 And now all these things did Alma and his

148
00:05:37,602 --> 00:05:40,269
 fellow laborers do who were over the church, walking in

149
00:05:40,269 --> 00:05:42,936
 all diligence, teaching the word of God in all

150
00:05:42,936 --> 00:05:45,603
 things, suffering all manner of afflictions, being

151
00:05:45,603 --> 00:05:48,27
 persecuted by all those who did not belong to the

152
00:05:48,27 --> 00:05:50,937
 church of God

153
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:51,284
39 And they did admonish their brethren; and they

154
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:51,684
 were also admonished, every one by the word of

155
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:52,084
 God, according to his sins, or to the sins which he

156
00:05:52,084 --> 00:05:52,484
 had committed, being commanded of God to pray

157
00:05:52,484 --> 00:05:52,884
 without ceasing, and to give thanks in all things.
