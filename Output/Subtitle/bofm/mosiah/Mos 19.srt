00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,75
Chapter 19 Gideon seeks to slay King Noah—The

2
00:00:01,75 --> 00:00:03,5
 Lamanites invade the land—King Noah suffers death by

3
00:00:03,5 --> 00:00:05,25
 fire—Limhi rules as a tributary monarch. About

4
00:00:05,25 --> 00:00:07,0
 145–121 B.C.

5
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:13,308
1 And it came to pass that the army of the king

6
00:00:13,308 --> 00:00:18,641
 returned, having searched in vain for the people of

7
00:00:18,641 --> 00:00:23,974
 the Lord

8
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:26,591
2 And now behold, the forces of the king were

9
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:29,258
 small, having been reduced, and there began to be a

10
00:00:29,258 --> 00:00:31,925
 division among the remainder of the people

11
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:34,566
3 And the lesser part began to breathe out

12
00:00:34,566 --> 00:00:37,233
 threatenings against the king, and there began to be a

13
00:00:37,233 --> 00:00:39,9
 great contention among them

14
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,873
4 And now there was a man among them whose name

15
00:00:41,873 --> 00:00:43,873
 was Gideon, and he being a strong man and an enemy

16
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:45,873
 to the king, therefore he drew his sword, and swore

17
00:00:45,873 --> 00:00:47,873
 in his wrath that he would slay the king

18
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,848
5 And it came to pass that he fought with the

19
00:00:49,848 --> 00:00:51,848
 king; and when the king saw that he was about to

20
00:00:51,848 --> 00:00:53,848
 overpower him, he fled and ran and got upon the tower

21
00:00:53,848 --> 00:00:55,848
 which was near the temple

22
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,422
6 And Gideon pursued after him and was about to

23
00:00:57,422 --> 00:00:59,022
 get upon the tower to slay the king, and the king

24
00:00:59,022 --> 00:01:00,622
 cast his eyes round about towards the land of

25
00:01:00,622 --> 00:01:02,222
 Shemlon, and behold, the army of the Lamanites were

26
00:01:02,222 --> 00:01:03,822
 within the borders of the land

27
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,797
7 And now the king cried out in the anguish of his

28
00:01:05,797 --> 00:01:07,797
 soul, saying: Gideon, spare me, for the Lamanites

29
00:01:07,797 --> 00:01:09,797
 are upon us, and they will destroy us; yea, they

30
00:01:09,797 --> 00:01:11,797
 will destroy my people

31
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:14,439
8 And now the king was not so much concerned about

32
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:17,106
 his people as he was about his own life;

33
00:01:17,106 --> 00:01:19,773
 nevertheless, Gideon did spare his life

34
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,746
9 And the king commanded the people that they

35
00:01:21,746 --> 00:01:23,746
 should flee before the Lamanites, and he himself did

36
00:01:23,746 --> 00:01:25,746
 go before them, and they did flee into the

37
00:01:25,746 --> 00:01:27,746
 wilderness, with their women and their children

38
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:30,388
10 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did

39
00:01:30,388 --> 00:01:33,055
 pursue them, and did overtake them, and began to slay

40
00:01:33,055 --> 00:01:35,722
 them

41
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:38,363
11 Now it came to pass that the king commanded

42
00:01:38,363 --> 00:01:41,03
 them that all the men should leave their wives and

43
00:01:41,03 --> 00:01:43,697
 their children, and flee before the Lamanites

44
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:45,67
12 Now there were many that would not leave them,

45
00:01:45,67 --> 00:01:47,67
 but had rather stay and perish with them. And the

46
00:01:47,67 --> 00:01:49,67
 rest left their wives and their children and fled

47
00:01:49,67 --> 00:01:51,67


48
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:53,645
13 And it came to pass that those who tarried with

49
00:01:53,645 --> 00:01:55,645
 their wives and their children caused that their

50
00:01:55,645 --> 00:01:57,645
 fair daughters should stand forth and plead with

51
00:01:57,645 --> 00:01:59,645
 the Lamanites that they would not slay them

52
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:02,287
14 And it came to pass that the Lamanites had

53
00:02:02,287 --> 00:02:04,954
 compassion on them, for they were charmed with the

54
00:02:04,954 --> 00:02:07,621
 beauty of their women

55
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:08,394
15 Therefore the Lamanites did spare their lives,

56
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:09,194
 and took them captives and carried them back to

57
00:02:09,194 --> 00:02:09,994
 the land of Nephi, and granted unto them that they

58
00:02:09,994 --> 00:02:10,794
 might possess the land, under the conditions that

59
00:02:10,794 --> 00:02:11,594
 they would deliver up king Noah into the hands of

60
00:02:11,594 --> 00:02:12,394
 the Lamanites, and deliver up their property, even

61
00:02:12,394 --> 00:02:13,194
 one half of all they possessed, one half of their

62
00:02:13,194 --> 00:02:13,994
 gold, and their silver, and all their precious

63
00:02:13,994 --> 00:02:14,794
 things, and thus they should pay tribute to the king

64
00:02:14,794 --> 00:02:15,594
 of the Lamanites from year to year

65
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:18,236
16 And now there was one of the sons of the king

66
00:02:18,236 --> 00:02:20,903
 among those that were taken captive, whose name was

67
00:02:20,903 --> 00:02:23,57
 Limhi

68
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,543
17 And now Limhi was desirous that his father

69
00:02:25,543 --> 00:02:27,543
 should not be destroyed; nevertheless, Limhi was not

70
00:02:27,543 --> 00:02:29,543
 ignorant of the iniquities of his father, he

71
00:02:29,543 --> 00:02:31,543
 himself being a just man

72
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,118
18 And it came to pass that Gideon sent men into

73
00:02:33,118 --> 00:02:34,718
 the wilderness secretly, to search for the king and

74
00:02:34,718 --> 00:02:36,318
 those that were with him. And it came to pass

75
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:37,918
 that they met the people in the wilderness, all save

76
00:02:37,918 --> 00:02:39,518
 the king and his priests

77
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,093
19 Now they had sworn in their hearts that they

78
00:02:41,093 --> 00:02:42,693
 would return to the land of Nephi, and if their

79
00:02:42,693 --> 00:02:44,293
 wives and their children were slain, and also those

80
00:02:44,293 --> 00:02:45,893
 that had tarried with them, that they would seek

81
00:02:45,893 --> 00:02:47,493
 revenge, and also perish with them

82
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,467
20 And the king commanded them that they should

83
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:51,467
 not return; and they were angry with the king, and

84
00:02:51,467 --> 00:02:53,467
 caused that he should suffer, even unto death by

85
00:02:53,467 --> 00:02:55,467
 fire

86
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:59,442
21 And they were about to take the priests also

87
00:02:59,442 --> 00:03:03,442
 and put them to death, and they fled before them

88
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:04,56
22 And it came to pass that they were about to

89
00:03:04,56 --> 00:03:05,703
 return to the land of Nephi, and they met the men of

90
00:03:05,703 --> 00:03:06,846
 Gideon. And the men of Gideon told them of all

91
00:03:06,846 --> 00:03:07,989
 that had happened to their wives and their children;

92
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:09,132
 and that the Lamanites had granted unto them that

93
00:03:09,132 --> 00:03:10,275
 they might possess the land by paying a tribute to

94
00:03:10,275 --> 00:03:11,418
 the Lamanites of one half of all they possessed

95
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:14,058
23 And the people told the men of Gideon that they

96
00:03:14,058 --> 00:03:16,725
 had slain the king, and his priests had fled from

97
00:03:16,725 --> 00:03:19,392
 them farther into the wilderness

98
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:22,566
24 And it came to pass that after they had ended

99
00:03:22,566 --> 00:03:25,766
 the ceremony, that they returned to the land of

100
00:03:25,766 --> 00:03:28,966
 Nephi, rejoicing, because their wives and their

101
00:03:28,966 --> 00:03:32,166
 children were not slain; and they told Gideon what they

102
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:35,366
 had done to the king

103
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,982
25 And it came to pass that the king of the

104
00:03:37,982 --> 00:03:40,649
 Lamanites made an oath unto them, that his people should

105
00:03:40,649 --> 00:03:43,316
 not slay them

106
00:03:43,29 --> 00:03:44,89
26 And also Limhi, being the son of the king,

107
00:03:44,89 --> 00:03:46,49
 having the kingdom conferred upon him by the people,

108
00:03:46,49 --> 00:03:48,09
 made oath unto the king of the Lamanites that his

109
00:03:48,09 --> 00:03:49,69
 people should pay tribute unto him, even one half

110
00:03:49,69 --> 00:03:51,29
 of all they possessed

111
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,931
27 And it came to pass that Limhi began to

112
00:03:53,931 --> 00:03:56,598
 establish the kingdom and to establish peace among his

113
00:03:56,598 --> 00:03:59,265
 people

114
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,572
28 And the king of the Lamanites set guards round

115
00:04:00,572 --> 00:04:01,905
 about the land, that he might keep the people of

116
00:04:01,905 --> 00:04:03,238
 Limhi in the land, that they might not depart into

117
00:04:03,238 --> 00:04:04,571
 the wilderness; and he did support his guards out

118
00:04:04,571 --> 00:04:05,904
 of the tribute which he did receive from the

119
00:04:05,904 --> 00:04:07,237
 Nephites

120
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:09,214
29 And now king Limhi did have continual peace in

121
00:04:09,214 --> 00:04:11,214
 his kingdom for the space of two years, that the

122
00:04:11,214 --> 00:04:13,214
 Lamanites did not molest them nor seek to destroy

123
00:04:13,214 --> 00:04:15,214
 them.
