00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:02,25
Chapter 19 Gideon seeks to slay King

2
00:00:02,25 --> 00:00:04,5
Noah—The Lamanites invade the land—King

3
00:00:04,5 --> 00:00:06,75
Noah suffers death by fire—Limhi rules

4
00:00:06,75 --> 00:00:09,443
as a tributary monarch. About 145–121 B.C. 

5
00:00:09,443 --> 00:00:13,443
1 And it came to pass that the army

6
00:00:13,443 --> 00:00:17,443
of the king returned, having

7
00:00:17,443 --> 00:00:21,321
searched in vain for the people of the Lord.

8
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:25,071
2 And now behold, the forces of the

9
00:00:25,071 --> 00:00:28,821
king were small, having been

10
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:32,571
reduced, and there began to be a

11
00:00:32,571 --> 00:00:36,336
division among the remainder of the people.

12
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:36,836
3 And the lesser part began to

13
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:37,336
breathe out threatenings

14
00:00:37,336 --> 00:00:37,836
against the king, and there began to

15
00:00:37,836 --> 00:00:38,739
be a great contention among them.

16
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:38,596
4 And now there was a man

17
00:00:38,596 --> 00:00:38,453
among them whose name was

18
00:00:38,453 --> 00:00:38,31
Gideon, and he being a strong

19
00:00:38,31 --> 00:00:38,167
man and an enemy to the

20
00:00:38,167 --> 00:00:38,024
king, therefore he drew his

21
00:00:38,024 --> 00:00:37,881
sword, and swore in his

22
00:00:37,881 --> 00:00:37,804
wrath that he would slay the king.

23
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:37,661
5 And it came to pass

24
00:00:37,661 --> 00:00:37,518
that he fought with the

25
00:00:37,518 --> 00:00:37,375
king; and when the king saw

26
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:37,232
that he was about to

27
00:00:37,232 --> 00:00:37,089
overpower him, he fled and ran

28
00:00:37,089 --> 00:00:36,946
and got upon the tower

29
00:00:36,946 --> 00:00:36,87
which was near the temple.

30
00:00:36,87 --> 00:00:37,17
6 And Gideon pursued

31
00:00:37,17 --> 00:00:37,47
after him and was about

32
00:00:37,47 --> 00:00:37,77
to get upon the tower

33
00:00:37,77 --> 00:00:38,07
to slay the king, and

34
00:00:38,07 --> 00:00:38,37
the king cast his

35
00:00:38,37 --> 00:00:38,67
eyes round about towards

36
00:00:38,67 --> 00:00:38,97
the land of Shemlon,

37
00:00:38,97 --> 00:00:39,27
and behold, the army of

38
00:00:39,27 --> 00:00:39,57
the Lamanites were

39
00:00:39,57 --> 00:00:39,273
within the borders of the land.

40
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:39,148
7 And now the king

41
00:00:39,148 --> 00:00:39,023
cried out in the

42
00:00:39,023 --> 00:00:38,898
anguish of his soul,

43
00:00:38,898 --> 00:00:38,773
saying: Gideon, spare me,

44
00:00:38,773 --> 00:00:38,648
for the Lamanites are

45
00:00:38,648 --> 00:00:38,523
upon us, and they

46
00:00:38,523 --> 00:00:38,398
will destroy us; yea,

47
00:00:38,398 --> 00:00:38,338
they will destroy my people.

48
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:38,195
8 And now the king

49
00:00:38,195 --> 00:00:38,052
was not so much

50
00:00:38,052 --> 00:00:37,909
concerned about his

51
00:00:37,909 --> 00:00:37,766
people as he was

52
00:00:37,766 --> 00:00:37,623
about his own

53
00:00:37,623 --> 00:00:37,48
life; nevertheless,

54
00:00:37,48 --> 00:00:37,404
Gideon did spare his life.

55
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:37,313
9 And the king

56
00:00:37,313 --> 00:00:37,222
commanded the

57
00:00:37,222 --> 00:00:37,131
people that they

58
00:00:37,131 --> 00:00:37,04
should flee before the

59
00:00:37,04 --> 00:00:36,949
Lamanites, and

60
00:00:36,949 --> 00:00:36,858
he himself did go

61
00:00:36,858 --> 00:00:36,767
before them, and

62
00:00:36,767 --> 00:00:36,676
they did flee

63
00:00:36,676 --> 00:00:36,585
into the wilderness,

64
00:00:36,585 --> 00:00:36,494
with their women

65
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:36,47
and their children.

66
00:00:36,47 --> 00:00:36,756
10 And it came

67
00:00:36,756 --> 00:00:37,042
to pass that

68
00:00:37,042 --> 00:00:37,328
the Lamanites did

69
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:37,614
pursue them,

70
00:00:37,614 --> 00:00:37,9
and did overtake

71
00:00:37,9 --> 00:00:38,186
them, and

72
00:00:38,186 --> 00:00:38,872
began to slay them.

73
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:38,772
11 Now it came

74
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:38,672
to pass that

75
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:38,572
the king

76
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:38,472
commanded them that

77
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:38,372
all the men

78
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:38,272
should leave

79
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:38,172
their wives and

80
00:00:38,172 --> 00:00:38,072
their

81
00:00:38,072 --> 00:00:37,972
children, and flee

82
00:00:37,972 --> 00:00:37,938
before the Lamanites.

83
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:37,938
12 Now there

84
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:37,938
were many

85
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:37,938
that would not

86
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:37,938
leave them,

87
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:37,938
but had rather

88
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:37,938
stay and

89
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:37,938
perish with them.

90
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:37,938
And the rest

91
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:37,938
left their

92
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:37,938
wives and

93
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:37,004
their children and fled.

94
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:37,137
13 And it

95
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:37,27
came to pass

96
00:00:37,27 --> 00:00:37,403
that those

97
00:00:37,403 --> 00:00:37,536
who tarried

98
00:00:37,536 --> 00:00:37,669
with their

99
00:00:37,669 --> 00:00:37,802
wives and their

100
00:00:37,802 --> 00:00:37,935
children

101
00:00:37,935 --> 00:00:38,068
caused that

102
00:00:38,068 --> 00:00:38,201
their fair

103
00:00:38,201 --> 00:00:38,334
daughters

104
00:00:38,334 --> 00:00:38,467
should stand

105
00:00:38,467 --> 00:00:38,6
forth and plead

106
00:00:38,6 --> 00:00:38,733
with the

107
00:00:38,733 --> 00:00:38,866
Lamanites that

108
00:00:38,866 --> 00:00:39,406
they would not slay them.

109
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:40,906
14 And it

110
00:00:40,906 --> 00:00:42,406
came to pass

111
00:00:42,406 --> 00:00:43,906
that the

112
00:00:43,906 --> 00:00:45,406
Lamanites

113
00:00:45,406 --> 00:00:46,906
had

114
00:00:46,906 --> 00:00:48,406
compassion on them,

115
00:00:48,406 --> 00:00:49,906
for they

116
00:00:49,906 --> 00:00:51,406
were charmed

117
00:00:51,406 --> 00:00:52,906
with the

118
00:00:52,906 --> 00:00:54,421
beauty of their women.

119
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:54,777
15

120
00:00:54,777 --> 00:00:55,133
Therefore the

121
00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:55,489
Lamanites did

122
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:55,845
spare

123
00:00:55,845 --> 00:00:56,201
their lives,

124
00:00:56,201 --> 00:00:56,557
and took

125
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:56,913
them

126
00:00:56,913 --> 00:00:57,269
captives and

127
00:00:57,269 --> 00:00:57,625
carried them

128
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:57,981
back to

129
00:00:57,981 --> 00:00:58,337
the land of

130
00:00:58,337 --> 00:00:58,693
Nephi, and

131
00:00:58,693 --> 00:00:59,049
granted

132
00:00:59,049 --> 00:00:59,405
unto them

133
00:00:59,405 --> 00:00:59,761
that they

134
00:00:59,761 --> 00:01:00,117
might

135
00:01:00,117 --> 00:01:00,473
possess the

136
00:01:00,473 --> 00:01:00,829
land, under

137
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:01,185
the

138
00:01:01,185 --> 00:01:01,541
conditions that

139
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:01,897
they would

140
00:01:01,897 --> 00:01:02,253
deliver up

141
00:01:02,253 --> 00:01:02,609
king Noah

142
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:02,965
into the

143
00:01:02,965 --> 00:01:03,321
hands of

144
00:01:03,321 --> 00:01:03,677
the

145
00:01:03,677 --> 00:01:04,033
Lamanites, and

146
00:01:04,033 --> 00:01:04,389
deliver up

147
00:01:04,389 --> 00:01:04,745
their

148
00:01:04,745 --> 00:01:05,101
property, even

149
00:01:05,101 --> 00:01:05,457
one half

150
00:01:05,457 --> 00:01:05,813
of all they

151
00:01:05,813 --> 00:01:06,169


152
00:01:06,169 --> 00:01:06,525
possessed, one half

153
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:06,881
of their

154
00:01:06,881 --> 00:01:07,237
gold, and

155
00:01:07,237 --> 00:01:07,593
their

156
00:01:07,593 --> 00:01:07,949
silver, and

157
00:01:07,949 --> 00:01:08,305
all their

158
00:01:08,305 --> 00:01:08,661
precious

159
00:01:08,661 --> 00:01:09,017
things, and

160
00:01:09,017 --> 00:01:09,373
thus they

161
00:01:09,373 --> 00:01:09,729
should pay

162
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:10,085
tribute to

163
00:01:10,085 --> 00:01:10,37
the king of the Lamanites from year to year.

164
00:01:10,37 --> 00:01:10,734
16 And

165
00:01:10,734 --> 00:01:11,098
now there

166
00:01:11,098 --> 00:01:11,462
was one of

167
00:01:11,462 --> 00:01:11,826
the sons

168
00:01:11,826 --> 00:01:12,19
of the

169
00:01:12,19 --> 00:01:12,554
king among

170
00:01:12,554 --> 00:01:12,918
those

171
00:01:12,918 --> 00:01:13,282
that were

172
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:13,646
taken

173
00:01:13,646 --> 00:01:14,01
captive,

174
00:01:14,01 --> 00:01:14,308
whose name was Limhi.

175
00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:14,729
17 And

176
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:15,15
now Limhi

177
00:01:15,15 --> 00:01:15,571
was

178
00:01:15,571 --> 00:01:15,992
desirous

179
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:16,413
that his

180
00:01:16,413 --> 00:01:16,834
father

181
00:01:16,834 --> 00:01:17,255
should not

182
00:01:17,255 --> 00:01:17,676
be

183
00:01:17,676 --> 00:01:18,097
destroyed;

184
00:01:18,097 --> 00:01:18,518


185
00:01:18,518 --> 00:01:18,939
nevertheless,

186
00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:19,36
Limhi was

187
00:01:19,36 --> 00:01:19,781
not

188
00:01:19,781 --> 00:01:20,202
ignorant of

189
00:01:20,202 --> 00:01:20,623
the

190
00:01:20,623 --> 00:01:21,044
iniquities of

191
00:01:21,044 --> 00:01:21,465
his

192
00:01:21,465 --> 00:01:21,886
father, he

193
00:01:21,886 --> 00:01:22,282
himself being a just man.

194
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:22,454
18 And

195
00:01:22,454 --> 00:01:22,626
it came

196
00:01:22,626 --> 00:01:22,798
to

197
00:01:22,798 --> 00:01:22,97
pass that

198
00:01:22,97 --> 00:01:23,142
Gideon

199
00:01:23,142 --> 00:01:23,314
sent

200
00:01:23,314 --> 00:01:23,486
men into

201
00:01:23,486 --> 00:01:23,658
the

202
00:01:23,658 --> 00:01:23,83
wilderness

203
00:01:23,83 --> 00:01:24,002


204
00:01:24,002 --> 00:01:24,174
secretly, to

205
00:01:24,174 --> 00:01:24,346
