Chapter 19 Gideon seeks to slay King

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Noah—The Lamanites invade the land—King

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Noah suffers death by fire—Limhi rules

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:06:27,
as a tributary monarch. About 145–121 B.C. 

5
00:06:27,0 --> 00:06:27,0
1 And it came to pass that the army

6
00:06:27,0 --> 00:06:27,0
of the king returned, having

7
00:06:27,0 --> 00:19:35,
searched in vain for the people of the Lord.

8
00:19:35,0 --> 00:19:35,0
2 And now behold, the forces of the

9
00:19:35,0 --> 00:19:35,0
king were small, having been

10
00:19:35,0 --> 00:19:35,0
reduced, and there began to be a

11
00:19:35,0 --> 00:20:47,
division among the remainder of the people.

12
00:20:47,0 --> 00:20:47,0
3 And the lesser part began to

13
00:20:47,0 --> 00:20:47,0
breathe out threatenings

14
00:20:47,0 --> 00:20:47,0
against the king, and there began to

15
00:20:47,0 --> 00:26:16,
be a great contention among them.

16
00:26:16,0 --> 00:26:16,0
4 And now there was a man

17
00:26:16,0 --> 00:26:16,0
among them whose name was

18
00:26:16,0 --> 00:26:16,0
Gideon, and he being a strong

19
00:26:16,0 --> 00:26:16,0
man and an enemy to the

20
00:26:16,0 --> 00:26:16,0
king, therefore he drew his

21
00:26:16,0 --> 00:26:16,0
sword, and swore in his

22
00:26:16,0 --> 00:28:00,
wrath that he would slay the king.

23
00:28:00,0 --> 00:28:00,0
5 And it came to pass

24
00:28:00,0 --> 00:28:00,0
that he fought with the

25
00:28:00,0 --> 00:28:00,0
king; and when the king saw

26
00:28:00,0 --> 00:28:00,0
that he was about to

27
00:28:00,0 --> 00:28:00,0
overpower him, he fled and ran

28
00:28:00,0 --> 00:28:00,0
and got upon the tower

29
00:28:00,0 --> 00:35:44,
which was near the temple.

30
00:35:44,0 --> 00:35:44,0
6 And Gideon pursued

31
00:35:44,0 --> 00:35:44,0
after him and was about

32
00:35:44,0 --> 00:35:44,0
to get upon the tower

33
00:35:44,0 --> 00:35:44,0
to slay the king, and

34
00:35:44,0 --> 00:35:44,0
the king cast his

35
00:35:44,0 --> 00:35:44,0
eyes round about towards

36
00:35:44,0 --> 00:35:44,0
the land of Shemlon,

37
00:35:44,0 --> 00:35:44,0
and behold, the army of

38
00:35:44,0 --> 00:35:44,0
the Lamanites were

39
00:35:44,0 --> 00:43:28,
within the borders of the land.

40
00:43:28,0 --> 00:43:28,0
7 And now the king

41
00:43:28,0 --> 00:43:28,0
cried out in the

42
00:43:28,0 --> 00:43:28,0
anguish of his soul,

43
00:43:28,0 --> 00:43:28,0
saying: Gideon, spare me,

44
00:43:28,0 --> 00:43:28,0
for the Lamanites are

45
00:43:28,0 --> 00:43:28,0
upon us, and they

46
00:43:28,0 --> 00:43:28,0
will destroy us; yea,

47
00:43:28,0 --> 00:55:11,
they will destroy my people.

48
00:55:11,0 --> 00:55:11,0
8 And now the king

49
00:55:11,0 --> 00:55:11,0
was not so much

50
00:55:11,0 --> 00:55:11,0
concerned about his

51
00:55:11,0 --> 00:55:11,0
people as he was

52
00:55:11,0 --> 00:55:11,0
about his own

53
00:55:11,0 --> 00:55:11,0
life; nevertheless,

54
00:55:11,0 --> 00:54:43,
Gideon did spare his life.

55
00:54:43,0 --> 00:54:43,0
9 And the king

56
00:54:43,0 --> 00:54:43,0
commanded the

57
00:54:43,0 --> 00:54:43,0
people that they

58
00:54:43,0 --> 00:54:43,0
should flee before the

59
00:54:43,0 --> 00:54:43,0
Lamanites, and

60
00:54:43,0 --> 00:54:43,0
he himself did go

61
00:54:43,0 --> 00:54:43,0
before them, and

62
00:54:43,0 --> 00:54:43,0
they did flee

63
00:54:43,0 --> 00:54:43,0
into the wilderness,

64
00:54:43,0 --> 00:54:43,0
with their women

65
00:54:43,0 --> 00:56:55,
and their children.

66
00:56:55,0 --> 00:56:55,0
10 And it came

67
00:56:55,0 --> 00:56:55,0
to pass that

68
00:56:55,0 --> 00:56:55,0
the Lamanites did

69
00:56:55,0 --> 00:56:55,0
pursue them,

70
00:56:55,0 --> 00:56:55,0
and did overtake

71
00:56:55,0 --> 00:56:55,0
them, and

72
00:56:55,0 --> 00:58:53,
began to slay them.

73
00:58:53,0 --> 00:58:53,0
11 Now it came

74
00:58:53,0 --> 00:58:53,0
to pass that

75
00:58:53,0 --> 00:58:53,0
the king

76
00:58:53,0 --> 00:58:53,0
commanded them that

77
00:58:53,0 --> 00:58:53,0
all the men

78
00:58:53,0 --> 00:58:53,0
should leave

79
00:58:53,0 --> 00:58:53,0
their wives and

80
00:58:53,0 --> 00:58:53,0
their

81
00:58:53,0 --> 00:58:53,0
children, and flee

82
00:58:53,0 --> 00:58:25,
before the Lamanites.

83
00:58:25,0 --> 00:58:25,0
12 Now there

84
00:58:25,0 --> 00:58:25,0
were many

85
00:58:25,0 --> 00:58:25,0
that would not

86
00:58:25,0 --> 00:58:25,0
leave them,

87
00:58:25,0 --> 00:58:25,0
but had rather

88
00:58:25,0 --> 00:58:25,0
stay and

89
00:58:25,0 --> 00:58:25,0
perish with them.

90
00:58:25,0 --> 00:58:25,0
And the rest

91
00:58:25,0 --> 00:58:25,0
left their

92
00:58:25,0 --> 00:58:25,0
wives and

93
00:58:25,0 --> 01:03:21,
their children and fled.

94
01:03:21,0 --> 01:03:21,0
13 And it

95
01:03:21,0 --> 01:03:21,0
came to pass

96
01:03:21,0 --> 01:03:21,0
that those

97
01:03:21,0 --> 01:03:21,0
who tarried

98
01:03:21,0 --> 01:03:21,0
with their

99
01:03:21,0 --> 01:03:21,0
wives and their

100
01:03:21,0 --> 01:03:21,0
children

101
01:03:21,0 --> 01:03:21,0
caused that

102
01:03:21,0 --> 01:03:21,0
their fair

103
01:03:21,0 --> 01:03:21,0
daughters

104
01:03:21,0 --> 01:03:21,0
should stand

105
01:03:21,0 --> 01:03:21,0
forth and plead

106
01:03:21,0 --> 01:03:21,0
with the

107
01:03:21,0 --> 01:03:21,0
Lamanites that

108
01:03:21,0 --> 01:07:06,
they would not slay them.

109
01:07:06,0 --> 01:07:06,0
14 And it

110
01:07:06,0 --> 01:07:06,0
came to pass

111
01:07:06,0 --> 01:07:06,0
that the

112
01:07:06,0 --> 01:07:06,0
Lamanites

113
01:07:06,0 --> 01:07:06,0
had

114
01:07:06,0 --> 01:07:06,0
compassion on them,

115
01:07:06,0 --> 01:07:06,0
for they

116
01:07:06,0 --> 01:07:06,0
were charmed

117
01:07:06,0 --> 01:07:06,0
with the

118
01:07:06,0 --> 01:11:05,
beauty of their women.

119
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
15

120
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
Therefore the

121
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
Lamanites did

122
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
spare

123
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
their lives,

124
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
and took

125
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
them

126
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
captives and

127
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
carried them

128
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
back to

129
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
the land of

130
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
Nephi, and

131
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
granted

132
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
unto them

133
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
that they

134
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
might

135
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
possess the

136
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
land, under

137
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
the

138
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
conditions that

139
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
they would

140
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
deliver up

141
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
king Noah

142
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
into the

143
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
hands of

144
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
the

145
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
Lamanites, and

146
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
deliver up

147
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
their

148
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
property, even

149
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
one half

150
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
of all they

151
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0


152
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
possessed, one half

153
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
of their

154
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
gold, and

155
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
their

156
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
silver, and

157
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
all their

158
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
precious

159
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
things, and

160
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
thus they

161
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
should pay

162
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:05,0
tribute to

163
01:11:05,0 --> 01:11:19,
the king of the Lamanites from year to year.

164
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
16 And

165
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
now there

166
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
was one of

167
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
the sons

168
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
of the

169
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
king among

170
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
those

171
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
that were

172
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
taken

173
01:11:19,0 --> 01:11:19,0
captive,

174
01:11:19,0 --> 01:18:28,
whose name was Limhi.

175
01:18:28,0 --> 01:18:28,0
17 And

176
01:18:28,0 --> 01:18:28,0
now Limhi

177
01:18:28,0 --> 01:18:28,0
was

178
01:18:28,0 --> 01:18:28,0
desirous

179
01:18:28,0 --> 01:18:28,0
that his

180
01:18:28,0 --> 01:18:28,0
father

181
01:18:28,0 --> 01:18:28,0
should not

182
01:18:28,0 --> 01:18:28,0
be

183
01:18:28,0 --> 01:18:28,0
destroyed;

184
01:18:28,0 --> 01:18:28,0


185
01:18:28,0 --> 01:18:28,0
nevertheless,

186
01:18:28,0 --> 01:18:28,0
Limhi was

187
01:18:28,0 --> 01:18:28,0
not

188
01:18:28,0 --> 01:18:28,0
ignorant of

189
01:18:28,0 --> 01:18:28,0
the

190
01:18:28,0 --> 01:18:28,0
iniquities of

191
01:18:28,0 --> 01:18:28,0
his

192
01:18:28,0 --> 01:18:28,0
father, he

193
01:18:28,0 --> 01:22:13,
himself being a just man.

194
01:22:13,0 --> 01:22:13,0
18 And

195
01:22:13,0 --> 01:22:13,0
it came

196
01:22:13,0 --> 01:22:13,0
to

197
01:22:13,0 --> 01:22:13,0
pass that

198
01:22:13,0 --> 01:22:13,0
Gideon

199
01:22:13,0 --> 01:22:13,0
sent

200
01:22:13,0 --> 01:22:13,0
men into

201
01:22:13,0 --> 01:22:13,0
the

202
01:22:13,0 --> 01:22:13,0
wilderness

203
01:22:13,0 --> 01:22:13,0


204
01:22:13,0 --> 01:22:13,0
secretly, to

205
01:22:13,0 --> 01:22:13,0
search

206
01:22:13,0 --> 01:22:13,0
for the

207
01:22:13,0 --> 01:22:13,0
king

208
01:22:13,0 --> 01:22:13,0
and

209
01:22:13,0 --> 01:22:13,0
those that

210
01:22:13,0 --> 01:22:13,0
were

211
01:22:13,0 --> 01:22:13,0
with him.

212
01:22:13,0 --> 01:22:13,0
And it

213
01:22:13,0 --> 01:22:13,0
came

214
01:22:13,0 --> 01:22:13,0
to pass

215
01:22:13,0 --> 01:22:13,0
that

216
01:22:13,0 --> 01:22:13,0
they met

217
01:22:13,0 --> 01:22:13,0
the

218
01:22:13,0 --> 01:22:13,0
people in

219
01:22:13,0 --> 01:22:13,0
the

220
01:22:13,0 --> 01:22:13,0


221
01:22:13,0 --> 01:22:13,0
wilderness, all

222
01:22:13,0 --> 01:27:10,
save the king and his priests.

223
01:27:10,0 --> 01:27:10,0
19 Now

224
01:27:10,0 --> 01:27:10,0
they

225
01:27:10,0 --> 01:27:10,0
had

226
01:27:10,0 --> 01:27:10,0
sworn in

227
01:27:10,0 --> 01:27:10,0
their

228
