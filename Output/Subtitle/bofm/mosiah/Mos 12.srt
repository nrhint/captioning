00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:07,0
Chapter 12 Abinadi is imprisoned for prophesying

2
00:00:07,0 --> 00:00:14,0
the destruction of the people and the death of

3
00:00:14,0 --> 00:00:21,0
King Noah—The false priests quote the scriptures

4
00:00:21,0 --> 00:00:28,0
and pretend to keep the law of Moses—Abinadi begins

5
00:00:28,0 --> 00:00:35,802
to teach them the Ten Commandments. About 148 B.C. 

6
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:37,102
1 And it came to pass that after the space of

7
00:00:37,102 --> 00:00:38,402
two years that Abinadi came among them in

8
00:00:38,402 --> 00:00:39,702
disguise, that they knew him not, and began to

9
00:00:39,702 --> 00:00:41,002
prophesy among them, saying: Thus has the Lord

10
00:00:41,002 --> 00:00:42,302
commanded me, saying—Abinadi, go and prophesy

11
00:00:42,302 --> 00:00:43,602
unto this my people, for they have hardened

12
00:00:43,602 --> 00:00:44,902
their hearts against my words; they have repented

13
00:00:44,902 --> 00:00:46,202
not of their evil doings; therefore, I will

14
00:00:46,202 --> 00:00:47,502
visit them in my anger, yea, in my fierce anger

15
00:00:47,502 --> 00:00:48,181
will I visit them in their iniquities and abominations.

16
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:51,737
2 Yea, wo be unto this generation! And the

17
00:00:51,737 --> 00:00:55,293
Lord said unto me: Stretch forth thy hand and

18
00:00:55,293 --> 00:00:58,849
prophesy, saying: Thus saith the Lord, it shall

19
00:00:58,849 --> 00:01:02,405
come to pass that this generation, because of

20
00:01:02,405 --> 00:01:05,961
their iniquities, shall be brought into

21
00:01:05,961 --> 00:01:09,517
bondage, and shall be smitten on the cheek; yea, and

22
00:01:09,517 --> 00:01:13,073
shall be driven by men, and shall be slain;

23
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,629
and the vultures of the air, and the dogs, yea,

24
00:01:16,629 --> 00:01:20,08
and the wild beasts, shall devour their flesh.

25
00:01:20,08 --> 00:01:23,33
3 And it shall come to pass that the

26
00:01:23,33 --> 00:01:26,58
life of king Noah shall be valued

27
00:01:26,58 --> 00:01:29,83
even as a garment in a hot furnace;

28
00:01:29,83 --> 00:01:33,427
for he shall know that I am the Lord.

29
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,427
4 And it shall come to pass that I

30
00:01:35,427 --> 00:01:37,427
will smite this my people with sore

31
00:01:37,427 --> 00:01:39,427
afflictions, yea, with famine and

32
00:01:39,427 --> 00:01:41,427
with pestilence; and I will cause

33
00:01:41,427 --> 00:01:43,77
that they shall howl all the day long.

34
00:01:43,77 --> 00:01:46,27
5 Yea, and I will cause that

35
00:01:46,27 --> 00:01:48,77
they shall have burdens lashed

36
00:01:48,77 --> 00:01:51,27
upon their backs; and they shall

37
00:01:51,27 --> 00:01:53,213
be driven before like a dumb ass.

38
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:55,213
6 And it shall come to pass

39
00:01:55,213 --> 00:01:57,213
that I will send forth hail

40
00:01:57,213 --> 00:01:59,213
among them, and it shall smite

41
00:01:59,213 --> 00:02:01,213
them; and they shall also be

42
00:02:01,213 --> 00:02:03,213
smitten with the east wind;

43
00:02:03,213 --> 00:02:05,213
and insects shall pester their

44
00:02:05,213 --> 00:02:07,494
land also, and devour their grain.

45
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:07,694
7 And they shall be

46
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:07,894
smitten with a great

47
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:08,094
pestilence—and all this will I

48
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:08,294
do because of their

49
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:08,495
iniquities and abominations.

50
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:09,933
8 And it shall come to

51
00:02:09,933 --> 00:02:11,371
pass that except they

52
00:02:11,371 --> 00:02:12,809
repent I will utterly

53
00:02:12,809 --> 00:02:14,247
destroy them from off the

54
00:02:14,247 --> 00:02:15,685
face of the earth; yet

55
00:02:15,685 --> 00:02:17,123
they shall leave a

56
00:02:17,123 --> 00:02:18,561
record behind them, and I

57
00:02:18,561 --> 00:02:19,999
will preserve them for

58
00:02:19,999 --> 00:02:21,437
other nations which

59
00:02:21,437 --> 00:02:22,875
shall possess the land;

60
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:24,313
yea, even this will I do

61
00:02:24,313 --> 00:02:25,751
that I may discover the

62
00:02:25,751 --> 00:02:27,189
abominations of this

63
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:28,627
people to other nations.

64
00:02:28,627 --> 00:02:30,065
And many things did

65
00:02:30,065 --> 00:02:31,952
Abinadi prophesy against this people.

66
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:32,785
9 And it came to pass

67
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:33,618
that they were angry

68
00:02:33,618 --> 00:02:34,451
with him; and they

69
00:02:34,451 --> 00:02:35,284
took him and carried

70
00:02:35,284 --> 00:02:36,117
him bound before the

71
00:02:36,117 --> 00:02:36,95
king, and said unto

72
00:02:36,95 --> 00:02:37,783
the king: Behold, we

73
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:38,616
have brought a man

74
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:39,449
before thee who has

75
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:40,282
prophesied evil concerning

76
00:02:40,282 --> 00:02:41,115
thy people, and

77
00:02:41,115 --> 00:02:41,828
saith that God will destroy them.

78
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:41,661
10 And he also

79
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:41,494
prophesieth evil

80
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:41,327
concerning thy life, and

81
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:41,16
saith that thy life

82
00:02:41,16 --> 00:02:40,993
shall be as a garment

83
00:02:40,993 --> 00:02:40,894
in a furnace of fire.

84
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:40,894
11 And again, he

85
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:40,894
saith that thou

86
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:40,894
shalt be as a

87
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:40,894
stalk, even as a dry

88
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:40,894
stalk of the

89
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:40,894
field, which is run

90
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:40,894
over by the beasts

91
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:40,427
and trodden under foot.

92
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:40,374
12 And again, he

93
00:02:40,374 --> 00:02:40,321
saith thou

94
00:02:40,321 --> 00:02:40,268
shalt be as the

95
00:02:40,268 --> 00:02:40,215
blossoms of a

96
00:02:40,215 --> 00:02:40,162
thistle, which, when

97
00:02:40,162 --> 00:02:40,109
it is fully ripe,

98
00:02:40,109 --> 00:02:40,056
if the wind

99
00:02:40,056 --> 00:02:40,003
bloweth, it is

100
00:02:40,003 --> 00:02:39,95
driven forth upon

101
00:02:39,95 --> 00:02:39,897
the face of the

102
00:02:39,897 --> 00:02:39,844
land. And he

103
00:02:39,844 --> 00:02:39,791
pretendeth the Lord

104
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:39,738
hath spoken it.

105
00:02:39,738 --> 00:02:39,685
And he saith all

106
00:02:39,685 --> 00:02:39,632
this shall come

107
00:02:39,632 --> 00:02:39,579
upon thee except

108
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:39,526
thou repent,

109
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:39,473
and this because

110
00:02:39,473 --> 00:02:39,96
of thine iniquities.

111
00:02:39,96 --> 00:02:41,06
13 And now, O

112
00:02:41,06 --> 00:02:42,16
king, what great

113
00:02:42,16 --> 00:02:43,26
evil hast thou

114
00:02:43,26 --> 00:02:44,36
done, or what

115
00:02:44,36 --> 00:02:45,46
great sins have

116
00:02:45,46 --> 00:02:46,56
thy people

117
00:02:46,56 --> 00:02:47,66
committed, that we

118
00:02:47,66 --> 00:02:48,76
should be

119
00:02:48,76 --> 00:02:49,86
condemned of God or

120
00:02:49,86 --> 00:02:50,904
judged of this man?

121
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:51,268
14 And now, O

122
00:02:51,268 --> 00:02:51,632
king, behold,

123
00:02:51,632 --> 00:02:51,996
we are

124
00:02:51,996 --> 00:02:52,36
guiltless, and thou,

125
00:02:52,36 --> 00:02:52,724
O king, hast

126
00:02:52,724 --> 00:02:53,088
not sinned;

127
00:02:53,088 --> 00:02:53,452
therefore, this

128
00:02:53,452 --> 00:02:53,816
man has lied

129
00:02:53,816 --> 00:02:54,18
concerning you,

130
00:02:54,18 --> 00:02:54,544
and he has

131
00:02:54,544 --> 00:02:54,374
prophesied in vain.

132
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:55,624
15 And behold,

133
00:02:55,624 --> 00:02:56,874
we are

134
00:02:56,874 --> 00:02:58,124
strong, we shall not

135
00:02:58,124 --> 00:02:59,374
come into

136
00:02:59,374 --> 00:03:00,624
bondage, or be

137
00:03:00,624 --> 00:03:01,874
taken captive by

138
00:03:01,874 --> 00:03:03,124
our enemies;

139
00:03:03,124 --> 00:03:04,374
yea, and thou

140
00:03:04,374 --> 00:03:05,624
hast prospered

141
00:03:05,624 --> 00:03:06,874
in the land,

142
00:03:06,874 --> 00:03:08,124
and thou shalt

143
00:03:08,124 --> 00:03:09,389
also prosper.

144
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:10,139
16 Behold,

145
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:10,889
here is the

146
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:11,639
man, we deliver

147
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:12,389
him into thy

148
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:13,139
hands; thou

149
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:13,889
mayest do with

150
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:14,639
him as

151
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:15,262
seemeth thee good.

152
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:15,733
17 And it

153
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:16,204
came to pass

154
00:03:16,204 --> 00:03:16,675
that king

155
00:03:16,675 --> 00:03:17,146
Noah caused

156
00:03:17,146 --> 00:03:17,617
that Abinadi

157
00:03:17,617 --> 00:03:18,088
should be cast

158
00:03:18,088 --> 00:03:18,559
into

159
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:19,03
prison; and he

160
00:03:19,03 --> 00:03:19,501
commanded that

161
00:03:19,501 --> 00:03:19,972
the priests

162
00:03:19,972 --> 00:03:20,443
should

163
00:03:20,443 --> 00:03:20,914
gather themselves

164
00:03:20,914 --> 00:03:21,385
together

165
00:03:21,385 --> 00:03:21,856
that he might

166
00:03:21,856 --> 00:03:22,327
hold a

167
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:22,798
council with them

168
00:03:22,798 --> 00:03:23,67
what he should do with him.

169
00:03:23,67 --> 00:03:24,527
18 And it

170
00:03:24,527 --> 00:03:25,384
came to pass

171
00:03:25,384 --> 00:03:26,241
that they

172
00:03:26,241 --> 00:03:27,098
said unto

173
00:03:27,098 --> 00:03:27,955
the king:

174
00:03:27,955 --> 00:03:28,812
Bring him

175
00:03:28,812 --> 00:03:29,669
hither that we

176
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:30,526
may

177
00:03:30,526 --> 00:03:31,383
question him; and

178
00:03:31,383 --> 00:03:32,24
the king

179
00:03:32,24 --> 00:03:33,097
commanded

180
00:03:33,097 --> 00:03:33,954
that he

181
00:03:33,954 --> 00:03:34,811
should be

182
00:03:34,811 --> 00:03:35,549
brought before them.

183
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:36,12
19 And

184
00:03:36,12 --> 00:03:36,691
they began to

185
00:03:36,691 --> 00:03:37,262
question

186
00:03:37,262 --> 00:03:37,833
him, that

187
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:38,404
they might

188
00:03:38,404 --> 00:03:38,975
cross

189
00:03:38,975 --> 00:03:39,546
him, that

190
00:03:39,546 --> 00:03:40,117
thereby they

191
00:03:40,117 --> 00:03:40,688
might have

192
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:41,259
wherewith

193
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:41,83
to accuse

194
00:03:41,83 --> 00:03:42,401
him; but

195
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:42,972
he

196
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:43,543
answered them

197
00:03:43,543 --> 00:03:44,114
boldly, and

198
00:03:44,114 --> 00:03:44,685
withstood
