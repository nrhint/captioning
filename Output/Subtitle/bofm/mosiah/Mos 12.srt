00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:03,0
Chapter 12 Abinadi is imprisoned for prophesying

2
00:00:03,0 --> 00:00:06,0
 the destruction of the people and the death of King

3
00:00:06,0 --> 00:00:09,0
 Noah—The false priests quote the scriptures and

4
00:00:09,0 --> 00:00:12,0
 pretend to keep the law of Moses—Abinadi begins to

5
00:00:12,0 --> 00:00:15,0
 teach them the Ten Commandments. About 148 B.C.

6
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:16,749
1 And it came to pass that after the space of two

7
00:00:16,749 --> 00:00:17,549
 years that Abinadi came among them in disguise,

8
00:00:17,549 --> 00:00:18,349
 that they knew him not, and began to prophesy among

9
00:00:18,349 --> 00:00:19,149
 them, saying: Thus has the Lord commanded me,

10
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:19,949
 saying—Abinadi, go and prophesy unto this my people,

11
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:20,749
 for they have hardened their hearts against my

12
00:00:20,749 --> 00:00:21,549
 words; they have repented not of their evil doings;

13
00:00:21,549 --> 00:00:22,349
 therefore, I will visit them in my anger, yea, in my

14
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:23,149
 fierce anger will I visit them in their

15
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:23,949
 iniquities and abominations

16
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,702
2 Yea, wo be unto this generation! And the Lord

17
00:00:25,702 --> 00:00:27,48
 said unto me: Stretch forth thy hand and prophesy,

18
00:00:27,48 --> 00:00:29,258
 saying: Thus saith the Lord, it shall come to pass

19
00:00:29,258 --> 00:00:31,036
 that this generation, because of their iniquities,

20
00:00:31,036 --> 00:00:32,814
 shall be brought into bondage, and shall be

21
00:00:32,814 --> 00:00:34,592
 smitten on the cheek; yea, and shall be driven by men,

22
00:00:34,592 --> 00:00:36,37
 and shall be slain; and the vultures of the air,

23
00:00:36,37 --> 00:00:38,148
 and the dogs, yea, and the wild beasts, shall

24
00:00:38,148 --> 00:00:39,926
 devour their flesh

25
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,54
3 And it shall come to pass that the life of king

26
00:00:42,54 --> 00:00:45,207
 Noah shall be valued even as a garment in a hot

27
00:00:45,207 --> 00:00:47,874
 furnace; for he shall know that I am the Lord

28
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:53,848
4 And it shall come to pass that I will smite this

29
00:00:53,848 --> 00:00:59,848
 my people with sore afflictions, yea, with famine

30
00:00:59,848 --> 00:01:05,848
 and with pestilence; and I will cause that they

31
00:01:05,848 --> 00:01:11,848
 shall howl all the day long

32
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:14,439
5 Yea, and I will cause that they shall have

33
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:17,106
 burdens lashed upon their backs; and they shall be

34
00:01:17,106 --> 00:01:19,773
 driven before like a dumb ass

35
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,346
6 And it shall come to pass that I will send forth

36
00:01:21,346 --> 00:01:22,946
 hail among them, and it shall smite them; and

37
00:01:22,946 --> 00:01:24,546
 they shall also be smitten with the east wind; and

38
00:01:24,546 --> 00:01:26,146
 insects shall pester their land also, and devour

39
00:01:26,146 --> 00:01:27,746
 their grain

40
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:33,054
7 And they shall be smitten with a great

41
00:01:33,054 --> 00:01:38,387
 pestilence—and all this will I do because of their

42
00:01:38,387 --> 00:01:43,72
 iniquities and abominations

43
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:44,67
8 And it shall come to pass that except they

44
00:01:44,67 --> 00:01:45,67
 repent I will utterly destroy them from off the face of

45
00:01:45,67 --> 00:01:46,67
 the earth; yet they shall leave a record behind

46
00:01:46,67 --> 00:01:47,67
 them, and I will preserve them for other nations

47
00:01:47,67 --> 00:01:48,67
 which shall possess the land; yea, even this will I

48
00:01:48,67 --> 00:01:49,67
 do that I may discover the abominations of this

49
00:01:49,67 --> 00:01:50,67
 people to other nations. And many things did Abinadi

50
00:01:50,67 --> 00:01:51,67
 prophesy against this people

51
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:52,978
9 And it came to pass that they were angry with

52
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:54,311
 him; and they took him and carried him bound before

53
00:01:54,311 --> 00:01:55,644
 the king, and said unto the king: Behold, we have

54
00:01:55,644 --> 00:01:56,977
 brought a man before thee who has prophesied evil

55
00:01:56,977 --> 00:01:58,31
 concerning thy people, and saith that God will

56
00:01:58,31 --> 00:01:59,643
 destroy them

57
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:12,953
10 And he also prophesieth evil concerning thy

58
00:02:12,953 --> 00:02:26,286
 life, and saith that thy life shall be as a garment

59
00:02:26,286 --> 00:02:39,619
 in a furnace of fire

60
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:47,493
11 And again, he saith that thou shalt be as a

61
00:02:47,493 --> 00:02:55,493
 stalk, even as a dry stalk of the field, which is run

62
00:02:55,493 --> 00:03:03,493
 over by the beasts and trodden under foot

63
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:04,56
12 And again, he saith thou shalt be as the

64
00:03:04,56 --> 00:03:05,703
 blossoms of a thistle, which, when it is fully ripe, if

65
00:03:05,703 --> 00:03:06,846
 the wind bloweth, it is driven forth upon the face

66
00:03:06,846 --> 00:03:07,989
 of the land. And he pretendeth the Lord hath

67
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:09,132
 spoken it. And he saith all this shall come upon thee

68
00:03:09,132 --> 00:03:10,275
 except thou repent, and this because of thine

69
00:03:10,275 --> 00:03:11,418
 iniquities

70
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,391
13 And now, O king, what great evil hast thou

71
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:15,391
 done, or what great sins have thy people committed,

72
00:03:15,391 --> 00:03:17,391
 that we should be condemned of God or judged of this

73
00:03:17,391 --> 00:03:19,391
 man

74
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,366
14 And now, O king, behold, we are guiltless, and

75
00:03:21,366 --> 00:03:23,366
 thou, O king, hast not sinned; therefore, this man

76
00:03:23,366 --> 00:03:25,366
 has lied concerning you, and he has prophesied in

77
00:03:25,366 --> 00:03:27,366
 vain

78
00:03:27,34 --> 00:03:29,34
15 And behold, we are strong, we shall not come

79
00:03:29,34 --> 00:03:31,34
 into bondage, or be taken captive by our enemies;

80
00:03:31,34 --> 00:03:33,34
 yea, and thou hast prospered in the land, and thou

81
00:03:33,34 --> 00:03:35,34
 shalt also prosper

82
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,982
16 Behold, here is the man, we deliver him into

83
00:03:37,982 --> 00:03:40,649
 thy hands; thou mayest do with him as seemeth thee

84
00:03:40,649 --> 00:03:43,316
 good

85
00:03:43,29 --> 00:03:48,09
17 And it came to pass that king Noah caused that

86
00:03:48,09 --> 00:03:52,89
 Abinadi should be cast into prison; and he

87
00:03:52,89 --> 00:03:57,69
 commanded that the priests should gather themselves

88
00:03:57,69 --> 00:04:02,49
 together that he might hold a council with them what he

89
00:04:02,49 --> 00:04:07,29
 should do with him

90
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:13,214
18 And it came to pass that they said unto the

91
00:04:13,214 --> 00:04:19,214
 king: Bring him hither that we may question him; and

92
00:04:19,214 --> 00:04:25,214
 the king commanded that he should be brought

93
00:04:25,214 --> 00:04:31,214
 before them

94
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:36,471
19 And they began to question him, that they might

95
00:04:36,471 --> 00:04:41,804
 cross him, that thereby they might have wherewith

96
00:04:41,804 --> 00:04:47,137
 to accuse him; but he answered them boldly, and

97
00:04:47,137 --> 00:04:52,47
 withstood all their questions, yea, to their

98
00:04:52,47 --> 00:04:57,803
 astonishment; for he did withstand them in all their

99
00:04:57,803 --> 00:05:03,136
 questions, and did confound them in all their words

100
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:10,703
20 And it came to pass that one of them said unto

101
00:05:10,703 --> 00:05:18,37
 him: What meaneth the words which are written, and

102
00:05:18,37 --> 00:05:26,037
 which have been taught by our fathers, saying

103
00:05:26,96 --> 00:05:28,56
21 How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet

104
00:05:28,56 --> 00:05:30,16
 of him that bringeth good tidings; that publisheth

105
00:05:30,16 --> 00:05:31,76
 peace; that bringeth good tidings of good; that

106
00:05:31,76 --> 00:05:33,36
 publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God

107
00:05:33,36 --> 00:05:34,96
 reigneth

108
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:37,602
22 Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the

109
00:05:37,602 --> 00:05:40,269
 voice together shall they sing; for they shall see

110
00:05:40,269 --> 00:05:42,936
 eye to eye when the Lord shall bring again Zion

111
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:50,909
23 Break forth into joy; sing together ye waste

112
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:58,909
 places of Jerusalem; for the Lord hath comforted his

113
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:06,909
 people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem

114
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,5
24 The Lord hath made bare his holy arm in the

115
00:06:09,5 --> 00:06:12,167
 eyes of all the nations, and all the ends of the

116
00:06:12,167 --> 00:06:14,834
 earth shall see the salvation of our God

117
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:16,808
25 And now Abinadi said unto them: Are you

118
00:06:16,808 --> 00:06:18,808
 priests, and pretend to teach this people, and to

119
00:06:18,808 --> 00:06:20,808
 understand the spirit of prophesying, and yet desire to

120
00:06:20,808 --> 00:06:22,808
 know of me what these things mean

121
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,782
26 I say unto you, wo be unto you for perverting

122
00:06:24,782 --> 00:06:26,782
 the ways of the Lord! For if ye understand these

123
00:06:26,782 --> 00:06:28,782
 things ye have not taught them; therefore, ye have

124
00:06:28,782 --> 00:06:30,782
 perverted the ways of the Lord

125
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:38,757
27 Ye have not applied your hearts to

126
00:06:38,757 --> 00:06:46,757
 understanding; therefore, ye have not been wise. Therefore,

127
00:06:46,757 --> 00:06:54,757
 what teach ye this people

128
00:06:54,681 --> 00:07:02,681
28 And they said: We teach the law of Moses

129
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:03,799
29 And again he said unto them: If ye teach the

130
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:04,942
 law of Moses why do ye not keep it? Why do ye set

131
00:07:04,942 --> 00:07:06,085
 your hearts upon riches? Why do ye commit whoredoms

132
00:07:06,085 --> 00:07:07,228
 and spend your strength with harlots, yea, and

133
00:07:07,228 --> 00:07:08,371
 cause this people to commit sin, that the Lord has

134
00:07:08,371 --> 00:07:09,514
 cause to send me to prophesy against this people,

135
00:07:09,514 --> 00:07:10,657
 yea, even a great evil against this people

136
00:07:10,63 --> 00:07:13,297
30 Know ye not that I speak the truth? Yea, ye

137
00:07:13,297 --> 00:07:15,964
 know that I speak the truth; and you ought to tremble

138
00:07:15,964 --> 00:07:18,631
 before God

139
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,205
31 And it shall come to pass that ye shall be

140
00:07:20,205 --> 00:07:21,805
 smitten for your iniquities, for ye have said that ye

141
00:07:21,805 --> 00:07:23,405
 teach the law of Moses. And what know ye

142
00:07:23,405 --> 00:07:25,005
 concerning the law of Moses? Doth salvation come by the law

143
00:07:25,005 --> 00:07:26,605
 of Moses? What say ye

144
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:38,579
32 And they answered and said that salvation did

145
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:50,579
 come by the law of Moses

146
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:52,503
33 But now Abinadi said unto them: I know if ye

147
00:07:52,503 --> 00:07:54,503
 keep the commandments of God ye shall be saved; yea,

148
00:07:54,503 --> 00:07:56,503
 if ye keep the commandments which the Lord

149
00:07:56,503 --> 00:07:58,503
 delivered unto Moses in the mount of Sinai, saying

150
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,145
34 I am the Lord thy God, who hath brought thee

151
00:08:01,145 --> 00:08:03,812
 out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of

152
00:08:03,812 --> 00:08:06,479
 bondage

153
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:14,453
35 Thou shalt have no other God before me

154
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:17,094
36 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image,

155
00:08:17,094 --> 00:08:19,761
 or any likeness of any thing in heaven above, or

156
00:08:19,761 --> 00:08:22,428
 things which are in the earth beneath

157
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:22,902
37 Now Abinadi said unto them, Have ye done all

158
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:23,402
 this? I say unto you, Nay, ye have not. And have ye

159
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:23,902
 taught this people that they should do all these

160
00:08:23,902 --> 00:08:24,402
 things? I say unto you, Nay, ye have not.
