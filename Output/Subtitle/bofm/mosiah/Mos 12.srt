00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 12 Abinadi is imprisoned for prophesying

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the destruction of the people and the death of

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
King Noah—The false priests quote the scriptures

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and pretend to keep the law of Moses—Abinadi begins

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:07:30,
to teach them the Ten Commandments. About 148 B.C. 

6
00:07:30,0 --> 00:07:30,0
1 And it came to pass that after the space of

7
00:07:30,0 --> 00:07:30,0
two years that Abinadi came among them in

8
00:07:30,0 --> 00:07:30,0
disguise, that they knew him not, and began to

9
00:07:30,0 --> 00:07:30,0
prophesy among them, saying: Thus has the Lord

10
00:07:30,0 --> 00:07:30,0
commanded me, saying—Abinadi, go and prophesy

11
00:07:30,0 --> 00:07:30,0
unto this my people, for they have hardened

12
00:07:30,0 --> 00:07:30,0
their hearts against my words; they have repented

13
00:07:30,0 --> 00:07:30,0
not of their evil doings; therefore, I will

14
00:07:30,0 --> 00:07:30,0
visit them in my anger, yea, in my fierce anger

15
00:07:30,0 --> 00:09:58,
will I visit them in their iniquities and abominations.

16
00:09:58,0 --> 00:09:58,0
2 Yea, wo be unto this generation! And the

17
00:09:58,0 --> 00:09:58,0
Lord said unto me: Stretch forth thy hand and

18
00:09:58,0 --> 00:09:58,0
prophesy, saying: Thus saith the Lord, it shall

19
00:09:58,0 --> 00:09:58,0
come to pass that this generation, because of

20
00:09:58,0 --> 00:09:58,0
their iniquities, shall be brought into

21
00:09:58,0 --> 00:09:58,0
bondage, and shall be smitten on the cheek; yea, and

22
00:09:58,0 --> 00:09:58,0
shall be driven by men, and shall be slain;

23
00:09:58,0 --> 00:09:58,0
and the vultures of the air, and the dogs, yea,

24
00:09:58,0 --> 00:14:54,
and the wild beasts, shall devour their flesh.

25
00:14:54,0 --> 00:14:54,0
3 And it shall come to pass that the

26
00:14:54,0 --> 00:14:54,0
life of king Noah shall be valued

27
00:14:54,0 --> 00:14:54,0
even as a garment in a hot furnace;

28
00:14:54,0 --> 00:23:21,
for he shall know that I am the Lord.

29
00:23:21,0 --> 00:23:21,0
4 And it shall come to pass that I

30
00:23:21,0 --> 00:23:21,0
will smite this my people with sore

31
00:23:21,0 --> 00:23:21,0
afflictions, yea, with famine and

32
00:23:21,0 --> 00:23:21,0
with pestilence; and I will cause

33
00:23:21,0 --> 00:22:53,
that they shall howl all the day long.

34
00:22:53,0 --> 00:22:53,0
5 Yea, and I will cause that

35
00:22:53,0 --> 00:22:53,0
they shall have burdens lashed

36
00:22:53,0 --> 00:22:53,0
upon their backs; and they shall

37
00:22:53,0 --> 00:22:25,
be driven before like a dumb ass.

38
00:22:25,0 --> 00:22:25,0
6 And it shall come to pass

39
00:22:25,0 --> 00:22:25,0
that I will send forth hail

40
00:22:25,0 --> 00:22:25,0
among them, and it shall smite

41
00:22:25,0 --> 00:22:25,0
them; and they shall also be

42
00:22:25,0 --> 00:22:25,0
smitten with the east wind;

43
00:22:25,0 --> 00:22:25,0
and insects shall pester their

44
00:22:25,0 --> 00:22:11,
land also, and devour their grain.

45
00:22:11,0 --> 00:22:11,0
7 And they shall be

46
00:22:11,0 --> 00:22:11,0
smitten with a great

47
00:22:11,0 --> 00:22:11,0
pestilence—and all this will I

48
00:22:11,0 --> 00:22:11,0
do because of their

49
00:22:11,0 --> 00:23:09,
iniquities and abominations.

50
00:23:09,0 --> 00:23:09,0
8 And it shall come to

51
00:23:09,0 --> 00:23:09,0
pass that except they

52
00:23:09,0 --> 00:23:09,0
repent I will utterly

53
00:23:09,0 --> 00:23:09,0
destroy them from off the

54
00:23:09,0 --> 00:23:09,0
face of the earth; yet

55
00:23:09,0 --> 00:23:09,0
they shall leave a

56
00:23:09,0 --> 00:23:09,0
record behind them, and I

57
00:23:09,0 --> 00:23:09,0
will preserve them for

58
00:23:09,0 --> 00:23:09,0
other nations which

59
00:23:09,0 --> 00:23:09,0
shall possess the land;

60
00:23:09,0 --> 00:23:09,0
yea, even this will I do

61
00:23:09,0 --> 00:23:09,0
that I may discover the

62
00:23:09,0 --> 00:23:09,0
abominations of this

63
00:23:09,0 --> 00:23:09,0
people to other nations.

64
00:23:09,0 --> 00:23:09,0
And many things did

65
00:23:09,0 --> 00:22:41,
Abinadi prophesy against this people.

66
00:22:41,0 --> 00:22:41,0
9 And it came to pass

67
00:22:41,0 --> 00:22:41,0
that they were angry

68
00:22:41,0 --> 00:22:41,0
with him; and they

69
00:22:41,0 --> 00:22:41,0
took him and carried

70
00:22:41,0 --> 00:22:41,0
him bound before the

71
00:22:41,0 --> 00:22:41,0
king, and said unto

72
00:22:41,0 --> 00:22:41,0
the king: Behold, we

73
00:22:41,0 --> 00:22:41,0
have brought a man

74
00:22:41,0 --> 00:22:41,0
before thee who has

75
00:22:41,0 --> 00:22:41,0
prophesied evil concerning

76
00:22:41,0 --> 00:22:41,0
thy people, and

77
00:22:41,0 --> 00:23:53,
saith that God will destroy them.

78
00:23:53,0 --> 00:23:53,0
10 And he also

79
00:23:53,0 --> 00:23:53,0
prophesieth evil

80
00:23:53,0 --> 00:23:53,0
concerning thy life, and

81
00:23:53,0 --> 00:23:53,0
saith that thy life

82
00:23:53,0 --> 00:23:53,0
shall be as a garment

83
00:23:53,0 --> 00:23:25,
in a furnace of fire.

84
00:23:25,0 --> 00:23:25,0
11 And again, he

85
00:23:25,0 --> 00:23:25,0
saith that thou

86
00:23:25,0 --> 00:23:25,0
shalt be as a

87
00:23:25,0 --> 00:23:25,0
stalk, even as a dry

88
00:23:25,0 --> 00:23:25,0
stalk of the

89
00:23:25,0 --> 00:23:25,0
field, which is run

90
00:23:25,0 --> 00:23:25,0
over by the beasts

91
00:23:25,0 --> 00:22:57,
and trodden under foot.

92
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
12 And again, he

93
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
saith thou

94
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
shalt be as the

95
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
blossoms of a

96
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
thistle, which, when

97
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
it is fully ripe,

98
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
if the wind

99
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
bloweth, it is

100
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
driven forth upon

101
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
the face of the

102
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
land. And he

103
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
pretendeth the Lord

104
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
hath spoken it.

105
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
And he saith all

106
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
this shall come

107
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
upon thee except

108
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
thou repent,

109
00:22:57,0 --> 00:22:57,0
and this because

110
00:22:57,0 --> 00:25:09,
of thine iniquities.

111
00:25:09,0 --> 00:25:09,0
13 And now, O

112
00:25:09,0 --> 00:25:09,0
king, what great

113
00:25:09,0 --> 00:25:09,0
evil hast thou

114
00:25:09,0 --> 00:25:09,0
done, or what

115
00:25:09,0 --> 00:25:09,0
great sins have

116
00:25:09,0 --> 00:25:09,0
thy people

117
00:25:09,0 --> 00:25:09,0
committed, that we

118
00:25:09,0 --> 00:25:09,0
should be

119
00:25:09,0 --> 00:25:09,0
condemned of God or

120
00:25:09,0 --> 00:55:30,
judged of this man?

121
00:55:30,0 --> 00:55:30,0
14 And now, O

122
00:55:30,0 --> 00:55:30,0
king, behold,

123
00:55:30,0 --> 00:55:30,0
we are

124
00:55:30,0 --> 00:55:30,0
guiltless, and thou,

125
00:55:30,0 --> 00:55:30,0
O king, hast

126
00:55:30,0 --> 00:55:30,0
not sinned;

127
00:55:30,0 --> 00:55:30,0
therefore, this

128
00:55:30,0 --> 00:55:30,0
man has lied

129
00:55:30,0 --> 00:55:30,0
concerning you,

130
00:55:30,0 --> 00:55:30,0
and he has

131
00:55:30,0 --> 01:01:12,
prophesied in vain.

132
01:01:12,0 --> 01:01:12,0
15 And behold,

133
01:01:12,0 --> 01:01:12,0
we are

134
01:01:12,0 --> 01:01:12,0
strong, we shall not

135
01:01:12,0 --> 01:01:12,0
come into

136
01:01:12,0 --> 01:01:12,0
bondage, or be

137
01:01:12,0 --> 01:01:12,0
taken captive by

138
01:01:12,0 --> 01:01:12,0
our enemies;

139
01:01:12,0 --> 01:01:12,0
yea, and thou

140
01:01:12,0 --> 01:01:12,0
hast prospered

141
01:01:12,0 --> 01:01:12,0
in the land,

142
01:01:12,0 --> 01:01:12,0
and thou shalt

143
01:01:12,0 --> 01:06:09,
also prosper.

144
01:06:09,0 --> 01:06:09,0
16 Behold,

145
01:06:09,0 --> 01:06:09,0
here is the

146
01:06:09,0 --> 01:06:09,0
man, we deliver

147
01:06:09,0 --> 01:06:09,0
him into thy

148
01:06:09,0 --> 01:06:09,0
hands; thou

149
01:06:09,0 --> 01:06:09,0
mayest do with

150
01:06:09,0 --> 01:06:09,0
him as

151
01:06:09,0 --> 01:13:03,
seemeth thee good.

152
01:13:03,0 --> 01:13:03,0
17 And it

153
01:13:03,0 --> 01:13:03,0
came to pass

154
01:13:03,0 --> 01:13:03,0
that king

155
01:13:03,0 --> 01:13:03,0
Noah caused

156
01:13:03,0 --> 01:13:03,0
that Abinadi

157
01:13:03,0 --> 01:13:03,0
should be cast

158
01:13:03,0 --> 01:13:03,0
into

159
01:13:03,0 --> 01:13:03,0
prison; and he

160
01:13:03,0 --> 01:13:03,0
commanded that

161
01:13:03,0 --> 01:13:03,0
the priests

162
01:13:03,0 --> 01:13:03,0
should

163
01:13:03,0 --> 01:13:03,0
gather themselves

164
01:13:03,0 --> 01:13:03,0
together

165
01:13:03,0 --> 01:13:03,0
that he might

166
01:13:03,0 --> 01:13:03,0
hold a

167
01:13:03,0 --> 01:13:03,0
council with them

168
01:13:03,0 --> 01:16:34,
what he should do with him.

169
01:16:34,0 --> 01:16:34,0
18 And it

170
01:16:34,0 --> 01:16:34,0
came to pass

171
01:16:34,0 --> 01:16:34,0
that they

172
01:16:34,0 --> 01:16:34,0
said unto

173
01:16:34,0 --> 01:16:34,0
the king:

174
01:16:34,0 --> 01:16:34,0
Bring him

175
01:16:34,0 --> 01:16:34,0
hither that we

176
01:16:34,0 --> 01:16:34,0
may

177
01:16:34,0 --> 01:16:34,0
question him; and

178
01:16:34,0 --> 01:16:34,0
the king

179
01:16:34,0 --> 01:16:34,0
commanded

180
01:16:34,0 --> 01:16:34,0
that he

181
01:16:34,0 --> 01:16:34,0
should be

182
01:16:34,0 --> 01:21:31,
brought before them.

183
01:21:31,0 --> 01:21:31,0
19 And

184
01:21:31,0 --> 01:21:31,0
they began to

185
01:21:31,0 --> 01:21:31,0
question

186
01:21:31,0 --> 01:21:31,0
him, that

187
01:21:31,0 --> 01:21:31,0
they might

188
01:21:31,0 --> 01:21:31,0
cross

189
01:21:31,0 --> 01:21:31,0
him, that

190
01:21:31,0 --> 01:21:31,0
thereby they

191
01:21:31,0 --> 01:21:31,0
might have

192
01:21:31,0 --> 01:21:31,0
wherewith

193
01:21:31,0 --> 01:21:31,0
to accuse

194
01:21:31,0 --> 01:21:31,0
him; but

195
01:21:31,0 --> 01:21:31,0
he

196
01:21:31,0 --> 01:21:31,0
answered them

197
01:21:31,0 --> 01:21:31,0
boldly, and

198
01:21:31,0 --> 01:21:31,0
withstood

199
01:21:31,0 --> 01:21:31,0
all their

200
01:21:31,0 --> 01:21:31,0
questions,

201
01:21:31,0 --> 01:21:31,0
yea, to

202
01:21:31,0 --> 01:21:31,0
their

203
01:21:31,0 --> 01:21:31,0
astonishment;

204
01:21:31,0 --> 01:21:31,0
for he did

205
01:21:31,0 --> 01:21:31,0
withstand

206
01:21:31,0 --> 01:21:31,0
them in all

207
01:21:31,0 --> 01:21:31,0
their

208
01:21:31,0 --> 01:21:31,0
questions,

209
01:21:31,0 --> 01:21:31,0
and did

210
01:21:31,0 --> 01:21:03,
confound them in all their words.

211
01:21:03,0 --> 01:21:03,0
20 And it

212
01:21:03,0 --> 01:21:03,0
came to

213
01:21:03,0 --> 01:21:03,0
pass that

214
01:21:03,0 --> 01:21:03,0
one of

215
01:21:03,0 --> 01:21:03,0
them said

216
01:21:03,0 --> 01:21:03,0
unto him:

217
01:21:03,0 --> 01:21:03,0
What

218
01:21:03,0 --> 01:21:03,0
meaneth the

219
01:21:03,0 --> 01:21:03,0
words
