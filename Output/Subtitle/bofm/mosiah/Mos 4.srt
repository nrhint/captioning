00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:02,667
Chapter 4 King Benjamin continues his

2
00:00:02,667 --> 00:00:05,334
address—Salvation comes because of the

3
00:00:05,334 --> 00:00:08,001
Atonement—Believe in God to be saved—Retain a

4
00:00:08,001 --> 00:00:10,668
remission of your sins through

5
00:00:10,668 --> 00:00:13,335
faithfulness—Impart of your substance to the poor—Do all

6
00:00:13,335 --> 00:00:16,383
things in wisdom and order. About 124 B.C. 

7
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:19,526
1 And now, it came to pass that when

8
00:00:19,526 --> 00:00:22,669
king Benjamin had made an end of speaking

9
00:00:22,669 --> 00:00:25,812
the words which had been delivered unto

10
00:00:25,812 --> 00:00:28,955
him by the angel of the Lord, that he

11
00:00:28,955 --> 00:00:32,098
cast his eyes round about on the multitude,

12
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:35,241
and behold they had fallen to the

13
00:00:35,241 --> 00:00:38,639
earth, for the fear of the Lord had come upon them.

14
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:40,639
2 And they had viewed themselves in

15
00:00:40,639 --> 00:00:42,639
their own carnal state, even less than

16
00:00:42,639 --> 00:00:44,639
the dust of the earth. And they all

17
00:00:44,639 --> 00:00:46,639
cried aloud with one voice, saying: O

18
00:00:46,639 --> 00:00:48,639
have mercy, and apply the atoning

19
00:00:48,639 --> 00:00:50,639
blood of Christ that we may receive

20
00:00:50,639 --> 00:00:52,639
forgiveness of our sins, and our hearts

21
00:00:52,639 --> 00:00:54,639
may be purified; for we believe in

22
00:00:54,639 --> 00:00:56,639
Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who

23
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:58,639
created heaven and earth, and all things;

24
00:00:58,639 --> 00:01:00,928
who shall come down among the children of men.

25
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:03,028
3 And it came to pass that after

26
00:01:03,028 --> 00:01:05,128
they had spoken these words the

27
00:01:05,128 --> 00:01:07,228
Spirit of the Lord came upon them,

28
00:01:07,228 --> 00:01:09,328
and they were filled with joy,

29
00:01:09,328 --> 00:01:11,428
having received a remission of their

30
00:01:11,428 --> 00:01:13,528
sins, and having peace of

31
00:01:13,528 --> 00:01:15,628
conscience, because of the exceeding faith

32
00:01:15,628 --> 00:01:17,728
which they had in Jesus Christ who

33
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:19,828
should come, according to the

34
00:01:19,828 --> 00:01:21,248
words which king Benjamin had spoken unto them.

35
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:23,123
4 And king Benjamin again opened

36
00:01:23,123 --> 00:01:24,998
his mouth and began to speak

37
00:01:24,998 --> 00:01:26,873
unto them, saying: My friends and

38
00:01:26,873 --> 00:01:28,748
my brethren, my kindred and my

39
00:01:28,748 --> 00:01:30,623
people, I would again call your

40
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:32,498
attention, that ye may hear and

41
00:01:32,498 --> 00:01:34,373
understand the remainder of my

42
00:01:34,373 --> 00:01:36,263
words which I shall speak unto you.

43
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:37,863
5 For behold, if the knowledge

44
00:01:37,863 --> 00:01:39,463
of the goodness of God at

45
00:01:39,463 --> 00:01:41,063
this time has awakened you to a

46
00:01:41,063 --> 00:01:42,663
sense of your nothingness, and

47
00:01:42,663 --> 00:01:44,671
your worthless and fallen state—

48
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:44,906
6 I say unto you, if ye have

49
00:01:44,906 --> 00:01:45,141
come to a knowledge of the

50
00:01:45,141 --> 00:01:45,376
goodness of God, and his

51
00:01:45,376 --> 00:01:45,611
matchless power, and his

52
00:01:45,611 --> 00:01:45,846
wisdom, and his patience, and his

53
00:01:45,846 --> 00:01:46,081
long-suffering towards the

54
00:01:46,081 --> 00:01:46,316
children of men; and also,

55
00:01:46,316 --> 00:01:46,551
the atonement which has been

56
00:01:46,551 --> 00:01:46,786
prepared from the foundation

57
00:01:46,786 --> 00:01:47,021
of the world, that thereby

58
00:01:47,021 --> 00:01:47,256
salvation might come to him

59
00:01:47,256 --> 00:01:47,491
that should put his trust in

60
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:47,726
the Lord, and should be

61
00:01:47,726 --> 00:01:47,961
diligent in keeping his

62
00:01:47,961 --> 00:01:48,196
commandments, and continue in the

63
00:01:48,196 --> 00:01:48,431
faith even unto the end of his

64
00:01:48,431 --> 00:01:48,609
life, I mean the life of the mortal body—

65
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:49,053
7 I say, that this is the

66
00:01:49,053 --> 00:01:49,497
man who receiveth salvation,

67
00:01:49,497 --> 00:01:49,941
through the atonement

68
00:01:49,941 --> 00:01:50,385
which was prepared from the

69
00:01:50,385 --> 00:01:50,829
foundation of the world for

70
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:51,273
all mankind, which ever were

71
00:01:51,273 --> 00:01:51,717
since the fall of Adam, or

72
00:01:51,717 --> 00:01:52,161
who are, or who ever shall

73
00:01:52,161 --> 00:01:52,079
be, even unto the end of the world.

74
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,523
8 And this is the means

75
00:01:57,523 --> 00:02:02,967
whereby salvation

76
00:02:02,967 --> 00:02:08,411
cometh. And there is none

77
00:02:08,411 --> 00:02:13,855
other salvation save this

78
00:02:13,855 --> 00:02:19,299
which hath been spoken of;

79
00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:24,743
neither are there any

80
00:02:24,743 --> 00:02:30,187
conditions whereby man

81
00:02:30,187 --> 00:02:35,631
can be saved except the

82
00:02:35,631 --> 00:02:41,828
conditions which I have told you.

83
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:42,192
9 Believe in God;

84
00:02:42,192 --> 00:02:42,556
believe that he is, and that

85
00:02:42,556 --> 00:02:42,92
he created all things,

86
00:02:42,92 --> 00:02:43,284
both in heaven and in

87
00:02:43,284 --> 00:02:43,648
earth; believe that he

88
00:02:43,648 --> 00:02:44,012
has all wisdom, and all

89
00:02:44,012 --> 00:02:44,376
power, both in heaven

90
00:02:44,376 --> 00:02:44,74
and in earth; believe

91
00:02:44,74 --> 00:02:45,104
that man doth not

92
00:02:45,104 --> 00:02:45,468
comprehend all the things

93
00:02:45,468 --> 00:02:45,298
which the Lord can comprehend.

94
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:45,598
10 And again, believe

95
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:45,898
that ye must repent of

96
00:02:45,898 --> 00:02:46,198
your sins and forsake

97
00:02:46,198 --> 00:02:46,498
them, and humble

98
00:02:46,498 --> 00:02:46,798
yourselves before God; and

99
00:02:46,798 --> 00:02:47,098
ask in sincerity of

100
00:02:47,098 --> 00:02:47,398
heart that he would

101
00:02:47,398 --> 00:02:47,698
forgive you; and now, if

102
00:02:47,698 --> 00:02:47,998
you believe all these

103
00:02:47,998 --> 00:02:48,769
things see that ye do them.

104
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:49,027
11 And again I say

105
00:02:49,027 --> 00:02:49,285
unto you as I have said

106
00:02:49,285 --> 00:02:49,543
before, that as ye

107
00:02:49,543 --> 00:02:49,801
have come to the

108
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:50,059
knowledge of the glory of

109
00:02:50,059 --> 00:02:50,317
God, or if ye have

110
00:02:50,317 --> 00:02:50,575
known of his goodness

111
00:02:50,575 --> 00:02:50,833
and have tasted of his

112
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:51,091
love, and have

113
00:02:51,091 --> 00:02:51,349
received a remission of

114
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:51,607
your sins, which

115
00:02:51,607 --> 00:02:51,865
causeth such exceedingly

116
00:02:51,865 --> 00:02:52,123
great joy in your

117
00:02:52,123 --> 00:02:52,381
souls, even so I would

118
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:52,639
that ye should remember,

119
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:52,897
and always retain in

120
00:02:52,897 --> 00:02:53,155
remembrance, the

121
00:02:53,155 --> 00:02:53,413
greatness of God, and

122
00:02:53,413 --> 00:02:53,671
your own nothingness,

123
00:02:53,671 --> 00:02:53,929
and his goodness and

124
00:02:53,929 --> 00:02:54,187
long-suffering towards

125
00:02:54,187 --> 00:02:54,445
you, unworthy

126
00:02:54,445 --> 00:02:54,703
creatures, and humble

127
00:02:54,703 --> 00:02:54,961
yourselves even in the

128
00:02:54,961 --> 00:02:55,219
depths of humility,

129
00:02:55,219 --> 00:02:55,477
calling on the name of

130
00:02:55,477 --> 00:02:55,735
the Lord daily, and

131
00:02:55,735 --> 00:02:55,993
standing steadfastly in

132
00:02:55,993 --> 00:02:56,251
the faith of that

133
00:02:56,251 --> 00:02:56,509
which is to come, which

134
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:56,743
was spoken by the mouth of the angel.

135
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:57,814
12 And behold, I

136
00:02:57,814 --> 00:02:58,885
say unto you that if

137
00:02:58,885 --> 00:02:59,956
ye do this ye shall

138
00:02:59,956 --> 00:03:01,027
always rejoice,

139
00:03:01,027 --> 00:03:02,098
and be filled with

140
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,169
the love of God, and

141
00:03:03,169 --> 00:03:04,24
always retain a

142
00:03:04,24 --> 00:03:05,311
remission of your

143
00:03:05,311 --> 00:03:06,382
sins; and ye shall grow

144
00:03:06,382 --> 00:03:07,453
in the knowledge

145
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:08,524
of the glory of him

146
00:03:08,524 --> 00:03:09,595
that created you,

147
00:03:09,595 --> 00:03:10,666
or in the knowledge

148
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:11,725
of that which is just and true.

149
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:12,725
13 And ye will

150
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:13,725
not have a mind to

151
00:03:13,725 --> 00:03:14,725
injure one

152
00:03:14,725 --> 00:03:15,725
another, but to live

153
00:03:15,725 --> 00:03:16,725
peaceably, and to

154
00:03:16,725 --> 00:03:17,725
render to every

155
00:03:17,725 --> 00:03:18,725
man according to

156
00:03:18,725 --> 00:03:19,7
that which is his due.

157
00:03:19,7 --> 00:03:20,6
14 And ye will

158
00:03:20,6 --> 00:03:21,5
not suffer your

159
00:03:21,5 --> 00:03:22,399
children that

160
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:23,299
they go hungry, or

161
00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:24,2
naked; neither

162
00:03:24,2 --> 00:03:25,1
will ye suffer

163
00:03:25,1 --> 00:03:25,0
that they

164
00:03:25,0 --> 00:03:26,899
transgress the laws of

165
00:03:26,899 --> 00:03:27,799
God, and fight

166
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:28,7
and quarrel one

167
00:03:28,7 --> 00:03:29,6
with another, and

168
00:03:29,6 --> 00:03:30,5
serve the devil,

169
00:03:30,5 --> 00:03:31,399
who is the

170
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:32,299
master of sin, or

171
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:33,2
who is the evil

172
00:03:33,2 --> 00:03:34,1
spirit which hath

173
00:03:34,1 --> 00:03:34,0
been spoken of

174
00:03:34,0 --> 00:03:35,899
by our fathers,

175
00:03:35,899 --> 00:03:36,799
he being an enemy

176
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:37,551
to all righteousness.

177
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,218
15 But ye will

178
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:40,885
teach them to

179
00:03:40,885 --> 00:03:42,552
walk in the ways

180
00:03:42,552 --> 00:03:44,219
of truth and

181
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:45,886
soberness; ye

182
00:03:45,886 --> 00:03:47,553
will teach them

183
00:03:47,553 --> 00:03:49,22
to love one

184
00:03:49,22 --> 00:03:50,887
another, and to

185
00:03:50,887 --> 00:03:52,532
serve one another.

186
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:52,767
16 And also, ye

187
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:53,002
yourselves

188
00:03:53,002 --> 00:03:53,237
will succor those

189
00:03:53,237 --> 00:03:53,472
that stand in

190
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:53,707
need of your

191
00:03:53,707 --> 00:03:53,942
succor; ye will

192
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:54,177
administer of

193
00:03:54,177 --> 00:03:54,412
your substance

194
00:03:54,412 --> 00:03:54,647
unto him that

195
00:03:54,647 --> 00:03:54,882
standeth in need;

196
00:03:54,882 --> 00:03:55,117
and ye will not

197
00:03:55,117 --> 00:03:55,352
suffer that the

198
00:03:55,352 --> 00:03:55,587
beggar putteth

199
00:03:55,587 --> 00:03:55,822
up his

200
00:03:55,822 --> 00:03:56,057
petition to you in

201
00:03:56,057 --> 00:03:56,292
vain, and turn him

202
00:03:56,292 --> 00:03:56,002
out to perish.

203
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,44
17 Perhaps

204
00:03:57,44 --> 00:03:58,878
thou shalt say:

205
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:00,316
The man has

206
00:04:00,316 --> 00:04:01,754
brought upon

207
00:04:01,754 --> 00:04:03,192
himself his

208
00:04:03,192 --> 00:04:04,63
misery; therefore I

209
00:04:04,63 --> 00:04:06,068
will stay my

210
00:04:06,068 --> 00:04:07,506
hand, and will

211
00:04:07,506 --> 00:04:08,944
not give unto

212
00:04:08,944 --> 00:04:10,382
him of my

213
00:04:10,382 --> 00:04:11,82
food, nor impart

214
00:04:11,82 --> 00:04:13,258
unto him of my

215
00:04:13,258 --> 00:04:14,696
substance that

216
00:04:14,696 --> 00:04:16,134
he may not

217
00:04:16,134 --> 00:04:17,572
suffer, for his

218
00:04:17,572 --> 00:04:19,926
punishments are just—

219
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:19,859
18 But I say

220
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:19,792
unto you, O

221
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:19,725
man, whosoever

222
00:04:19,725 --> 00:04:19,658
doeth this

223
00:04:19,658 --> 00:04:19,591
the same hath

224
00:04:19,591 --> 00:04:19,524
great cause

225
00:04:19,524 --> 00:04:19,457
to repent; and

226
00:04:19,457 --> 00:04:19,39
except he

227
00:04:19,39 --> 00:04:19,323
repenteth of

228
00:04:19,323 --> 00:04:19,256
that which he

229
00:04:19,256 --> 00:04:19,189
hath done he

230
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:19,122
perisheth

231
00:04:19,122 --> 00:04:19,055
forever, and hath

232
00:04:19,055 --> 00:04:18,988
no interest

233
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:18,992
in the kingdom of God.

234
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:18,992
19 For

235
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:18,992
behold, are we

236
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:18,992
not all

237
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:18,992
beggars? Do we not

238
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:18,992
all depend

239
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:18,992
upon the

240
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:18,992
same Being,

241
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:18,992
even God, for

242
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:18,992
all the

243
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:18,992
substance which

244
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:18,992
we have, for

245
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:18,992
both food

246
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:18,992
and raiment,

247
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:18,992
and for gold,

248
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:18,992
and for

249
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:18,992
silver, and for

250
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:18,992
all the

251
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:18,992
riches which we

252
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:18,058
have of every kind?

253
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:18,464
20 And

254
00:04:18,464 --> 00:04:18,87
behold, even at

255
00:04:18,87 --> 00:04:19,276
this time,

256
00:04:19,276 --> 00:04:19,682
ye have

257
00:04:19,682 --> 00:04:20,088
been calling

258
00:04:20,088 --> 00:04:20,494
on his

259
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:20,9
name, and

260
00:04:20,9 --> 00:04:21,306
begging for a

261
00:04:21,306 --> 00:04:21,712
remission of

262
00:04:21,712 --> 00:04:22,118
your sins.

263
00:04:22,118 --> 00:04:22,524
And has he

264
00:04:22,524 --> 00:04:22,93
suffered

265
00:04:22,93 --> 00:04:23,336
that ye have

266
00:04:23,336 --> 00:04:23,742
begged in

267
00:04:23,742 --> 00:04:24,148
vain? Nay;

268
00:04:24,148 --> 00:04:24,554
he has

269
00:04:24,554 --> 00:04:24,96
poured out his

270
00:04:24,96 --> 00:04:25,366
Spirit upon

271
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:25,772
you, and

272
00:04:25,772 --> 00:04:26,178
has caused

273
00:04:26,178 --> 00:04:26,584
that your

274
00:04:26,584 --> 00:04:26,99
hearts should

275
00:04:26,99 --> 00:04:27,396
be filled

276
00:04:27,396 --> 00:04:27,802
with joy,

277
00:04:27,802 --> 00:04:28,208
and has

278
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:28,614
caused that your

279
00:04:28,614 --> 00:04:29,02
mouths

280
00:04:29,02 --> 00:04:29,426
should be

281
00:04:29,426 --> 00:04:29,832
stopped that ye

282
00:04:29,832 --> 00:04:30,238
could not

283
00:04:30,238 --> 00:04:30,644
find

284
00:04:30,644 --> 00:04:31,404
utterance, so exceedingly great was your joy.

285
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:31,515
21 And

286
00:04:31,515 --> 00:04:31,626
now, if God,

287
00:04:31,626 --> 00:04:31,737
who has

288
00:04:31,737 --> 00:04:31,848
created you,

289
00:04:31,848 --> 00:04:31,959
on whom

290
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:32,07
you are

291
00:04:32,07 --> 00:04:32,181
dependent for

292
00:04:32,181 --> 00:04:32,292
your

293
00:04:32,292 --> 00:04:32,403
lives and for

294
00:04:32,403 --> 00:04:32,514
all that

295
00:04:32,514 --> 00:04:32,625
ye have and

296
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:32,736
are, doth

297
00:04:32,736 --> 00:04:32,847
grant

298
00:04:32,847 --> 00:04:32,958
unto you

299
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:33,069
whatsoever ye

300
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:33,18
ask that

301
00:04:33,18 --> 00:04:33,291
is right,

302
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:33,402
in faith,

303
00:04:33,402 --> 00:04:33,513
believing

304
00:04:33,513 --> 00:04:33,624
that ye

305
00:04:33,624 --> 00:04:33,735
shall

306
00:04:33,735 --> 00:04:33,846
receive, O then,

307
00:04:33,846 --> 00:04:33,957
how ye

308
00:04:33,957 --> 00:04:34,068
ought to

309
00:04:34,068 --> 00:04:34,179
impart of the

310
00:04:34,179 --> 00:04:34,29
substance

311
00:04:34,29 --> 00:04:34,875
that ye have one to another.

312
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:35,104
22 And if

313
00:04:35,104 --> 00:04:35,333
ye judge

314
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:35,562
the man

315
00:04:35,562 --> 00:04:35,791
who

316
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:36,02
putteth up his

317
00:04:36,02 --> 00:04:36,249
petition

318
00:04:36,249 --> 00:04:36,478
to you

319
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:36,707
for your

320
00:04:36,707 --> 00:04:36,936
substance

321
00:04:36,936 --> 00:04:37,165
that he

322
00:04:37,165 --> 00:04:37,394
perish

323
00:04:37,394 --> 00:04:37,623
not, and

324
00:04:37,623 --> 00:04:37,852
condemn him,

325
00:04:37,852 --> 00:04:38,081
how much

326
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:38,31
more

327
00:04:38,31 --> 00:04:38,539
just will be

328
00:04:38,539 --> 00:04:38,768
your

329
00:04:38,768 --> 00:04:38,997
condemnation

330
00:04:38,997 --> 00:04:39,226
for

331
00:04:39,226 --> 00:04:39,455
withholding

332
00:04:39,455 --> 00:04:39,684
your

333
00:04:39,684 --> 00:04:39,913
substance,

334
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:40,142
which doth

335
00:04:40,142 --> 00:04:40,371
not belong

336
00:04:40,371 --> 00:04:40,6
to you

337
00:04:40,6 --> 00:04:40,829
but to

338
00:04:40,829 --> 00:04:41,058
God, to whom

339
00:04:41,058 --> 00:04:41,287
also

340
00:04:41,287 --> 00:04:41,516
your life

341
00:04:41,516 --> 00:04:41,745
belongeth;

342
00:04:41,745 --> 00:04:41,974
and yet

343
00:04:41,974 --> 00:04:42,203
ye put up

344
00:04:42,203 --> 00:04:42,432
no

345
00:04:42,432 --> 00:04:42,661
petition, nor

346
00:04:42,661 --> 00:04:42,382
repent of the thing which thou hast done.

347
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:42,882
23 I say

348
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:43,382
unto

349
00:04:43,382 --> 00:04:43,882
you, wo be

350
00:04:43,882 --> 00:04:44,382
unto

351
00:04:44,382 --> 00:04:44,882
that man,

352
00:04:44,882 --> 00:04:45,382
for his

353
00:04:45,382 --> 00:04:45,882


354
00:04:45,882 --> 00:04:46,382
substance shall

355
00:04:46,382 --> 00:04:46,882
perish

356
00:04:46,882 --> 00:04:47,382
with him;

357
00:04:47,382 --> 00:04:47,882
and

358
00:04:47,882 --> 00:04:48,382
now, I say

359
00:04:48,382 --> 00:04:48,882
these

360
00:04:48,882 --> 00:04:49,382
things

361
00:04:49,382 --> 00:04:49,882
unto those

362
00:04:49,882 --> 00:04:50,382
who are

363
00:04:50,382 --> 00:04:50,882
rich as

364
00:04:50,882 --> 00:04:51,382


365
00:04:51,382 --> 00:04:51,882
pertaining to

366
00:04:51,882 --> 00:04:52,726
the things of this world.

367
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:52,878
24 And

368
00:04:52,878 --> 00:04:53,03
again,

369
00:04:53,03 --> 00:04:53,182
I say

370
00:04:53,182 --> 00:04:53,334
unto the

371
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:53,486
poor,

372
00:04:53,486 --> 00:04:53,638
ye who

373
00:04:53,638 --> 00:04:53,79
have

374
00:04:53,79 --> 00:04:53,942
not and

375
00:04:53,942 --> 00:04:54,094
yet have

376
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:54,246


377
00:04:54,246 --> 00:04:54,398
sufficient,

378
00:04:54,398 --> 00:04:54,55
that ye

379
00:04:54,55 --> 00:04:54,702
remain

380
00:04:54,702 --> 00:04:54,854
from

381
00:04:54,854 --> 00:04:55,006
day to

382
00:04:55,006 --> 00:04:55,158
day; I

383
00:04:55,158 --> 00:04:55,31
mean all

384
00:04:55,31 --> 00:04:55,462
you who

385
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:55,614
deny

386
00:04:55,614 --> 00:04:55,766
the

387
00:04:55,766 --> 00:04:55,918
beggar,

388
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:56,07
because ye

389
00:04:56,07 --> 00:04:56,222
have

390
00:04:56,222 --> 00:04:56,374
not; I

391
00:04:56,374 --> 00:04:56,526
would

392
00:04:56,526 --> 00:04:56,678
that ye

393
00:04:56,678 --> 00:04:56,83
say in

394
00:04:56,83 --> 00:04:56,982
your

395
00:04:56,982 --> 00:04:57,134
hearts

396
00:04:57,134 --> 00:04:57,286
that: I

397
00:04:57,286 --> 00:04:57,438
give not

398
00:04:57,438 --> 00:04:57,59
because

399
00:04:57,59 --> 00:04:57,664
I have not, but if I had I would give.

400
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:58,081
25 And

401
00:04:58,081 --> 00:04:58,498
now,

402
00:04:58,498 --> 00:04:58,915
if ye

403
00:04:58,915 --> 00:04:59,332
say

404
