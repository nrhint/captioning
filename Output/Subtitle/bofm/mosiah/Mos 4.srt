00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 4 King Benjamin continues his

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
address—Salvation comes because of the

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Atonement—Believe in God to be saved—Retain a

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
remission of your sins through

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
faithfulness—Impart of your substance to the poor—Do all

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:08:27,
things in wisdom and order. About 124 B.C. 

7
00:08:27,0 --> 00:08:27,0
1 And now, it came to pass that when

8
00:08:27,0 --> 00:08:27,0
king Benjamin had made an end of speaking

9
00:08:27,0 --> 00:08:27,0
the words which had been delivered unto

10
00:08:27,0 --> 00:08:27,0
him by the angel of the Lord, that he

11
00:08:27,0 --> 00:08:27,0
cast his eyes round about on the multitude,

12
00:08:27,0 --> 00:08:27,0
and behold they had fallen to the

13
00:08:27,0 --> 00:10:11,
earth, for the fear of the Lord had come upon them.

14
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
2 And they had viewed themselves in

15
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
their own carnal state, even less than

16
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
the dust of the earth. And they all

17
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
cried aloud with one voice, saying: O

18
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
have mercy, and apply the atoning

19
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
blood of Christ that we may receive

20
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
forgiveness of our sins, and our hearts

21
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
may be purified; for we believe in

22
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who

23
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
created heaven and earth, and all things;

24
00:10:11,0 --> 00:15:08,
who shall come down among the children of men.

25
00:15:08,0 --> 00:15:08,0
3 And it came to pass that after

26
00:15:08,0 --> 00:15:08,0
they had spoken these words the

27
00:15:08,0 --> 00:15:08,0
Spirit of the Lord came upon them,

28
00:15:08,0 --> 00:15:08,0
and they were filled with joy,

29
00:15:08,0 --> 00:15:08,0
having received a remission of their

30
00:15:08,0 --> 00:15:08,0
sins, and having peace of

31
00:15:08,0 --> 00:15:08,0
conscience, because of the exceeding faith

32
00:15:08,0 --> 00:15:08,0
which they had in Jesus Christ who

33
00:15:08,0 --> 00:15:08,0
should come, according to the

34
00:15:08,0 --> 00:14:40,
words which king Benjamin had spoken unto them.

35
00:14:40,0 --> 00:14:40,0
4 And king Benjamin again opened

36
00:14:40,0 --> 00:14:40,0
his mouth and began to speak

37
00:14:40,0 --> 00:14:40,0
unto them, saying: My friends and

38
00:14:40,0 --> 00:14:40,0
my brethren, my kindred and my

39
00:14:40,0 --> 00:14:40,0
people, I would again call your

40
00:14:40,0 --> 00:14:40,0
attention, that ye may hear and

41
00:14:40,0 --> 00:14:40,0
understand the remainder of my

42
00:14:40,0 --> 00:24:35,
words which I shall speak unto you.

43
00:24:35,0 --> 00:24:35,0
5 For behold, if the knowledge

44
00:24:35,0 --> 00:24:35,0
of the goodness of God at

45
00:24:35,0 --> 00:24:35,0
this time has awakened you to a

46
00:24:35,0 --> 00:24:35,0
sense of your nothingness, and

47
00:24:35,0 --> 00:29:45,
your worthless and fallen state—

48
00:29:45,0 --> 00:29:45,0
6 I say unto you, if ye have

49
00:29:45,0 --> 00:29:45,0
come to a knowledge of the

50
00:29:45,0 --> 00:29:45,0
goodness of God, and his

51
00:29:45,0 --> 00:29:45,0
matchless power, and his

52
00:29:45,0 --> 00:29:45,0
wisdom, and his patience, and his

53
00:29:45,0 --> 00:29:45,0
long-suffering towards the

54
00:29:45,0 --> 00:29:45,0
children of men; and also,

55
00:29:45,0 --> 00:29:45,0
the atonement which has been

56
00:29:45,0 --> 00:29:45,0
prepared from the foundation

57
00:29:45,0 --> 00:29:45,0
of the world, that thereby

58
00:29:45,0 --> 00:29:45,0
salvation might come to him

59
00:29:45,0 --> 00:29:45,0
that should put his trust in

60
00:29:45,0 --> 00:29:45,0
the Lord, and should be

61
00:29:45,0 --> 00:29:45,0
diligent in keeping his

62
00:29:45,0 --> 00:29:45,0
commandments, and continue in the

63
00:29:45,0 --> 00:29:45,0
faith even unto the end of his

64
00:29:45,0 --> 00:29:17,
life, I mean the life of the mortal body—

65
00:29:17,0 --> 00:29:17,0
7 I say, that this is the

66
00:29:17,0 --> 00:29:17,0
man who receiveth salvation,

67
00:29:17,0 --> 00:29:17,0
through the atonement

68
00:29:17,0 --> 00:29:17,0
which was prepared from the

69
00:29:17,0 --> 00:29:17,0
foundation of the world for

70
00:29:17,0 --> 00:29:17,0
all mankind, which ever were

71
00:29:17,0 --> 00:29:17,0
since the fall of Adam, or

72
00:29:17,0 --> 00:29:17,0
who are, or who ever shall

73
00:29:17,0 --> 00:28:49,
be, even unto the end of the world.

74
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
8 And this is the means

75
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
whereby salvation

76
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
cometh. And there is none

77
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
other salvation save this

78
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
which hath been spoken of;

79
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
neither are there any

80
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
conditions whereby man

81
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
can be saved except the

82
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,
conditions which I have told you.

83
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
9 Believe in God;

84
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
believe that he is, and that

85
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
he created all things,

86
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
both in heaven and in

87
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
earth; believe that he

88
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
has all wisdom, and all

89
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
power, both in heaven

90
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
and in earth; believe

91
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
that man doth not

92
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
comprehend all the things

93
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,
which the Lord can comprehend.

94
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
10 And again, believe

95
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
that ye must repent of

96
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
your sins and forsake

97
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
them, and humble

98
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
yourselves before God; and

99
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
ask in sincerity of

100
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
heart that he would

101
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
forgive you; and now, if

102
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
you believe all these

103
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,
things see that ye do them.

104
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
11 And again I say

105
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
unto you as I have said

106
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
before, that as ye

107
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
have come to the

108
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
knowledge of the glory of

109
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
God, or if ye have

110
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
known of his goodness

111
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
and have tasted of his

112
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
love, and have

113
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
received a remission of

114
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
your sins, which

115
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
causeth such exceedingly

116
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
great joy in your

117
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
souls, even so I would

118
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
that ye should remember,

119
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
and always retain in

120
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
remembrance, the

121
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
greatness of God, and

122
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
your own nothingness,

123
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
and his goodness and

124
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
long-suffering towards

125
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
you, unworthy

126
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
creatures, and humble

127
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
yourselves even in the

128
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
depths of humility,

129
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
calling on the name of

130
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
the Lord daily, and

131
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
standing steadfastly in

132
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
the faith of that

133
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
which is to come, which

134
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,
was spoken by the mouth of the angel.

135
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
12 And behold, I

136
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
say unto you that if

137
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
ye do this ye shall

138
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
always rejoice,

139
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
and be filled with

140
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
the love of God, and

141
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
always retain a

142
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
remission of your

143
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
sins; and ye shall grow

144
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
in the knowledge

145
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
of the glory of him

146
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
that created you,

147
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
or in the knowledge

148
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,
of that which is just and true.

149
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
13 And ye will

150
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
not have a mind to

151
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
injure one

152
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
another, but to live

153
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
peaceably, and to

154
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
render to every

155
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
man according to

156
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,
that which is his due.

157
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
14 And ye will

158
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
not suffer your

159
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
children that

160
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
they go hungry, or

161
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
naked; neither

162
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
will ye suffer

163
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
that they

164
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
transgress the laws of

165
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
God, and fight

166
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
and quarrel one

167
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
with another, and

168
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
serve the devil,

169
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
who is the

170
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
master of sin, or

171
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
who is the evil

172
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
spirit which hath

173
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
been spoken of

174
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
by our fathers,

175
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
he being an enemy

176
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,
to all righteousness.

177
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
15 But ye will

178
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
teach them to

179
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
walk in the ways

180
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
of truth and

181
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
soberness; ye

182
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
will teach them

183
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
to love one

184
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
another, and to

185
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,
serve one another.

186
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
16 And also, ye

187
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
yourselves

188
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
will succor those

189
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
that stand in

190
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
need of your

191
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
succor; ye will

192
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
administer of

193
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
your substance

194
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
unto him that

195
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
standeth in need;

196
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
and ye will not

197
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
suffer that the

198
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
beggar putteth

199
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
up his

200
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
petition to you in

201
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
vain, and turn him

202
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,
out to perish.

203
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
17 Perhaps

204
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
thou shalt say:

205
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
The man has

206
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
brought upon

207
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
himself his

208
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
misery; therefore I

209
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
will stay my

210
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
hand, and will

211
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
not give unto

212
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
him of my

213
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
food, nor impart

214
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
unto him of my

215
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
substance that

216
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
he may not

217
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
suffer, for his

218
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,
punishments are just—

219
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
18 But I say

220
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
unto you, O

221
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
man, whosoever

222
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
doeth this

223
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
the same hath

224
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
great cause

225
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
to repent; and

226
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
except he

227
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
repenteth of

228
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
that which he

229
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
hath done he

230
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
perisheth

231
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
forever, and hath

232
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
no interest

233
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,
in the kingdom of God.

234
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
19 For

235
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
behold, are we

236
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
not all

237
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
beggars? Do we not

238
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
all depend

239
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
upon the

240
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
same Being,

241
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
even God, for

242
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
all the

243
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
substance which

244
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
we have, for

245
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
both food

246
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
and raiment,

247
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
and for gold,

248
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
and for

249
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
silver, and for

250
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
all the

251
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
riches which we

252
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,
have of every kind?

253
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
20 And

254
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
behold, even at

255
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
this time,

256
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
ye have

257
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
been calling

258
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
on his

259
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
name, and

260
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
begging for a

261
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
remission of

262
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
your sins.

263
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
And has he

264
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
suffered

265
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
that ye have

266
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
begged in

267
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
vain? Nay;

268
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
he has

269
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
poured out his

270
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
Spirit upon

271
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
you, and

272
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
has caused

273
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
that your

274
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
hearts should

275
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
be filled

276
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
with joy,

277
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
and has

278
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
caused that your

279
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
mouths

280
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
should be

281
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
stopped that ye

282
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
could not

283
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
find

284
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,
utterance, so exceedingly great was your joy.

285
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
21 And

286
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
now, if God,

287
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
who has

288
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
created you,

289
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
on whom

290
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
you are

291
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
dependent for

292
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
your

293
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
lives and for

294
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
all that

295
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
ye have and

296
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
are, doth

297
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
grant

298
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
unto you

299
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
whatsoever ye

300
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
ask that

301
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
is right,

302
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
in faith,

303
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
believing

304
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
that ye

305
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
shall

306
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
receive, O then,

307
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
how ye

308
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
ought to

309
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
impart of the

310
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
substance

311
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,
that ye have one to another.

312
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
22 And if

313
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
ye judge

314
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
the man

315
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
who

316
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
putteth up his

317
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
petition

318
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
to you

319
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
for your

320
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
substance

321
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
that he

322
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
perish

323
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
not, and

324
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
condemn him,

325
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
how much

326
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
more

327
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
just will be

328
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
your

329
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
condemnation

330
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
for

331
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
withholding

332
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
your

333
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
substance,

334
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
which doth

335
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
not belong

336
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
to you

337
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
but to

338
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
God, to whom

339
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
also

340
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
your life

341
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
belongeth;

342
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
and yet

343
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
ye put up

344
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
no

345
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
petition, nor

346
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,
repent of the thing which thou hast done.

347
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
23 I say

348
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
unto

349
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
you, wo be

350
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
unto

351
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
that man,

352
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
for his

353
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0


354
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
substance shall

355
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
perish

356
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
with him;

357
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
and

358
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
now, I say

359
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
these

360
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
things

361
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
unto those

362
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
who are

363
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
rich as

364
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0


365
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
pertaining to

366
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,
the things of this world.

367
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
24 And

368
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
again,

369
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
I say

370
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
unto the

371
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
poor,

372
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
ye who

373
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
have

374
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
not and

375
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
yet have

376
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0


377
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
sufficient,

378
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
that ye

379
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
remain

380
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
from

381
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
day to

382
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
day; I

383
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
mean all

384
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
you who

385
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
deny

386
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
the

387
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
beggar,

388
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
because ye

389
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
have

390
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
not; I

391
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
would

392
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
that ye

393
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
say in

394
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
your

395
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
hearts

396
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
that: I

397
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
give not

398
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
because

399
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,
I have not, but if I had I would give.

400
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
25 And

401
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
now,

402
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
if ye

403
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
say

404
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
this in

00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
your

406
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0

407
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
ye

408
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
remain

409
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0


410
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
guiltless,

411
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
otherwise

412
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
ye

413
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
are

414
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
condemned;

415
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
and

416
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
your

417
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0


418
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
condemnation

419
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
is just

420
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
for

421
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
ye

422
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
covet that

423
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,
which ye have not received.

424
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
26

425
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
And

426
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
now, for

427
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
the

428
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
sake

429
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
of

430
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
these

431
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
things

432
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0


433
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
which I

434
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
have

435
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
spoken

436
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
unto

437
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0


438
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
you—that

439
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
is,

440
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
for

441
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
the

442
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
sake of

443
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0


444
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
retaining

445
00:28:49,0 --> 00:28:49,0
a
