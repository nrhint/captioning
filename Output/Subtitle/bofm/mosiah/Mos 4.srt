Chapter 4 King Benjamin continues his

00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:20,666
 address—Salvation comes because of the Atonement—Believe in

3
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:30,999
 God to be saved—Retain a remission of your sins

4
00:00:30,999 --> 00:00:41,332
 through faithfulness—Impart of your substance to the

 poor—Do all things in wisdom and order. About

7
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:08,462
1 And now, it came to pass that when king Benjamin

8
00:01:08,462 --> 00:01:14,295
 had made an end of speaking the words which had

9
00:01:14,295 --> 00:01:20,128
 been delivered unto him by the angel of the Lord,

10
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:25,961
 that he cast his eyes round about on the multitude,

11
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:31,794
 and behold they had fallen to the earth, for the

12
00:01:31,794 --> 00:01:37,627
 fear of the Lord had come upon them

13
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:42,042
2 And they had viewed themselves in their own

14
00:01:42,042 --> 00:01:46,486
 carnal state, even less than the dust of the earth.

15
00:01:46,486 --> 00:01:50,93
 And they all cried aloud with one voice, saying: O

16
00:01:50,93 --> 00:01:55,374
 have mercy, and apply the atoning blood of Christ

17
00:01:55,374 --> 00:01:59,818
 that we may receive forgiveness of our sins, and

18
00:01:59,818 --> 00:02:04,262
 our hearts may be purified; for we believe in Jesus

19
00:02:04,262 --> 00:02:08,706
 Christ, the Son of God, who created heaven and

20
00:02:08,706 --> 00:02:13,15
 earth, and all things; who shall come down among the

21
00:02:13,15 --> 00:02:17,594
 children of men

22
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:26,9
3 And it came to pass that after they had spoken

23
00:02:26,9 --> 00:02:36,329
 these words the Spirit of the Lord came upon them,

24
00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:45,758
 and they were filled with joy, having received a

25
00:02:45,758 --> 00:02:55,187
 remission of their sins, and having peace of

26
00:02:55,187 --> 00:03:04,616
 conscience, because of the exceeding faith which they

27
00:03:04,616 --> 00:03:14,045
 had in Jesus Christ who should come, according to

28
00:03:14,045 --> 00:03:23,474
 the words which king Benjamin had spoken unto them

29
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:29,57
4 And king Benjamin again opened his mouth and

30
00:03:29,57 --> 00:03:35,737
 began to speak unto them, saying: My friends and my

31
00:03:35,737 --> 00:03:41,904
 brethren, my kindred and my people, I would again

32
00:03:41,904 --> 00:03:48,071
 call your attention, that ye may hear and

33
00:03:48,071 --> 00:03:54,238
 understand the remainder of my words which I shall speak

34
00:03:54,238 --> 00:04:00,405
 unto you

35
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:05,623
5 For behold, if the knowledge of the goodness of

36
00:04:05,623 --> 00:04:10,873
 God at this time has awakened you to a sense of

37
00:04:10,873 --> 00:04:16,123
 your nothingness, and your worthless and fallen

38
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:21,373
 state

39
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:27,361
6 I say unto you, if ye have come to a knowledge

40
00:04:27,361 --> 00:04:33,361
 of the goodness of God, and his matchless power,

41
00:04:33,361 --> 00:04:39,361
 and his wisdom, and his patience, and his

42
00:04:39,361 --> 00:04:45,361
 long-suffering towards the children of men; and also, the

43
00:04:45,361 --> 00:04:51,361
 atonement which has been prepared from the

44
00:04:51,361 --> 00:04:57,361
 foundation of the world, that thereby salvation might come

45
00:04:57,361 --> 00:05:03,361
 to him that should put his trust in the Lord, and

46
00:05:03,361 --> 00:05:09,361
 should be diligent in keeping his commandments,

47
00:05:09,361 --> 00:05:15,361
 and continue in the faith even unto the end of his

48
00:05:15,361 --> 00:05:21,361
 life, I mean the life of the mortal body

49
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:27,355
7 I say, that this is the man who receiveth

50
00:05:27,355 --> 00:05:33,522
 salvation, through the atonement which was prepared from

51
00:05:33,522 --> 00:05:39,689
 the foundation of the world for all mankind,

52
00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:45,856
 which ever were since the fall of Adam, or who are, or

53
00:05:45,856 --> 00:05:52,023
 who ever shall be, even unto the end of the

54
00:05:52,023 --> 00:05:58,19
 world

55
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:04,724
8 And this is the means whereby salvation cometh.

56
00:06:04,724 --> 00:06:11,324
 And there is none other salvation save this which

57
00:06:11,324 --> 00:06:17,924
 hath been spoken of; neither are there any

58
00:06:17,924 --> 00:06:24,524
 conditions whereby man can be saved except the conditions

59
00:06:24,524 --> 00:06:31,124
 which I have told you

60
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:39,358
9 Believe in God; believe that he is, and that he

61
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:47,025
 created all things, both in heaven and in earth;

62
00:06:47,025 --> 00:06:54,692
 believe that he has all wisdom, and all power, both

63
00:06:54,692 --> 00:07:02,359
 in heaven and in earth; believe that man doth not

64
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:10,026
 comprehend all the things which the Lord can

65
00:07:10,026 --> 00:07:17,693
 comprehend

66
00:07:17,37 --> 00:07:24,17
10 And again, believe that ye must repent of your

67
00:07:24,17 --> 00:07:30,97
 sins and forsake them, and humble yourselves

68
00:07:30,97 --> 00:07:37,77
 before God; and ask in sincerity of heart that he would

69
00:07:37,77 --> 00:07:44,57
 forgive you; and now, if you believe all these

70
00:07:44,57 --> 00:07:51,37
 things see that ye do them

71
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:53,048
11 And again I say unto you as I have said before,

72
00:07:53,048 --> 00:07:54,191
 that as ye have come to the knowledge of the

73
00:07:54,191 --> 00:07:55,334
 glory of God, or if ye have known of his goodness and

74
00:07:55,334 --> 00:07:56,477
 have tasted of his love, and have received a

75
00:07:56,477 --> 00:07:57,62
 remission of your sins, which causeth such exceedingly

76
00:07:57,62 --> 00:07:58,763
 great joy in your souls, even so I would that ye

77
00:07:58,763 --> 00:07:59,906
 should remember, and always retain in remembrance,

78
00:07:59,906 --> 00:08:01,049
 the greatness of God, and your own nothingness,

79
00:08:01,049 --> 00:08:02,192
 and his goodness and long-suffering towards you,

80
00:08:02,192 --> 00:08:03,335
 unworthy creatures, and humble yourselves even in the

81
00:08:03,335 --> 00:08:04,478
 depths of humility, calling on the name of the

82
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:05,621
 Lord daily, and standing steadfastly in the faith of

83
00:08:05,621 --> 00:08:06,764
 that which is to come, which was spoken by the

84
00:08:06,764 --> 00:08:07,907
 mouth of the angel

85
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:09,187
12 And behold, I say unto you that if ye do this

86
00:08:09,187 --> 00:08:10,52
 ye shall always rejoice, and be filled with the

87
00:08:10,52 --> 00:08:11,853
 love of God, and always retain a remission of your

88
00:08:11,853 --> 00:08:13,186
 sins; and ye shall grow in the knowledge of the

89
00:08:13,186 --> 00:08:14,519
 glory of him that created you, or in the knowledge of

90
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:15,852
 that which is just and true

91
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,496
13 And ye will not have a mind to injure one

92
00:08:18,496 --> 00:08:21,163
 another, but to live peaceably, and to render to every

93
00:08:21,163 --> 00:08:23,83
 man according to that which is his due

94
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:27,232
14 And ye will not suffer your children that they

95
00:08:27,232 --> 00:08:30,661
 go hungry, or naked; neither will ye suffer that

96
00:08:30,661 --> 00:08:34,09
 they transgress the laws of God, and fight and

97
00:08:34,09 --> 00:08:37,519
 quarrel one with another, and serve the devil, who is

98
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,948
 the master of sin, or who is the evil spirit which

99
00:08:40,948 --> 00:08:44,377
 hath been spoken of by our fathers, he being an

100
00:08:44,377 --> 00:08:47,806
 enemy to all righteousness

101
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:50,394
15 But ye will teach them to walk in the ways of

102
00:08:50,394 --> 00:08:53,061
 truth and soberness; ye will teach them to love one

103
00:08:53,061 --> 00:08:55,728
 another, and to serve one another

104
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,369
16 And also, ye yourselves will succor those that

105
00:08:58,369 --> 00:09:01,036
 stand in need of your succor; ye will administer

106
00:09:01,036 --> 00:09:03,703
 of your substance unto him that standeth in need;

107
00:09:03,703 --> 00:09:06,37
 and ye will not suffer that the beggar putteth up

108
00:09:06,37 --> 00:09:09,037
 his petition to you in vain, and turn him out to

109
00:09:09,037 --> 00:09:11,704
 perish

110
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:14,851
17 Perhaps thou shalt say: The man has brought

111
00:09:14,851 --> 00:09:18,051
 upon himself his misery; therefore I will stay my

112
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:21,251
 hand, and will not give unto him of my food, nor

113
00:09:21,251 --> 00:09:24,451
 impart unto him of my substance that he may not

114
00:09:24,451 --> 00:09:27,651
 suffer, for his punishments are just

115
00:09:27,6 --> 00:09:29,2
18 But I say unto you, O man, whosoever doeth this

116
00:09:29,2 --> 00:09:30,8
 the same hath great cause to repent; and except

117
00:09:30,8 --> 00:09:32,4
 he repenteth of that which he hath done he

118
00:09:32,4 --> 00:09:34,0
 perisheth forever, and hath no interest in the kingdom of

119
00:09:34,0 --> 00:09:35,6
 God

120
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,175
19 For behold, are we not all beggars? Do we not

121
00:09:37,175 --> 00:09:38,775
 all depend upon the same Being, even God, for all

122
00:09:38,775 --> 00:09:40,375
 the substance which we have, for both food and

123
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,975
 raiment, and for gold, and for silver, and for all the

124
00:09:41,975 --> 00:09:43,575
 riches which we have of every kind

125
00:09:43,55 --> 00:09:45,55
20 And behold, even at this time, ye have been

126
00:09:45,55 --> 00:09:47,55
 calling on his name, and begging for a remission of

127
00:09:47,55 --> 00:09:49,55
 your sins. And has he suffered that ye have begged

128
00:09:49,55 --> 00:09:51,55
 in vain? Nay; he has poured out his Spirit upon

129
00:09:51,55 --> 00:09:53,55
 you, and has caused that your hearts should be

130
00:09:53,55 --> 00:09:55,55
 filled with joy, and has caused that your mouths should

131
00:09:55,55 --> 00:09:57,55
 be stopped that ye could not find utterance, so

132
00:09:57,55 --> 00:09:59,55
 exceedingly great was your joy

133
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:02,166
21 And now, if God, who has created you, on whom

134
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,833
 you are dependent for your lives and for all that

135
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,5
 ye have and are, doth grant unto you whatsoever ye

136
00:10:07,5 --> 00:10:10,167
 ask that is right, in faith, believing that ye

137
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:12,834
 shall receive, O then, how ye ought to impart of the

138
00:10:12,834 --> 00:10:15,501
 substance that ye have one to another

139
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,591
22 And if ye judge the man who putteth up his

140
00:10:16,591 --> 00:10:17,734
 petition to you for your substance that he perish not,

141
00:10:17,734 --> 00:10:18,877
 and condemn him, how much more just will be your

142
00:10:18,877 --> 00:10:20,02
 condemnation for withholding your substance, which

143
00:10:20,02 --> 00:10:21,163
 doth not belong to you but to God, to whom also

144
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:22,306
 your life belongeth; and yet ye put up no petition,

145
00:10:22,306 --> 00:10:23,449
 nor repent of the thing which thou hast done

146
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:27,423
23 I say unto you, wo be unto that man, for his

147
00:10:27,423 --> 00:10:31,423
 substance shall perish with him; and now, I say

148
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:35,423
 these things unto those who are rich as pertaining to

149
00:10:35,423 --> 00:10:39,423
 the things of this world

150
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:43,372
24 And again, I say unto the poor, ye who have not

151
00:10:43,372 --> 00:10:47,372
 and yet have sufficient, that ye remain from day

152
00:10:47,372 --> 00:10:51,372
 to day; I mean all you who deny the beggar,

153
00:10:51,372 --> 00:10:55,372
 because ye have not; I would that ye say in your hearts

154
00:10:55,372 --> 00:10:59,372
 that: I give not because I have not, but if I had

155
00:10:59,372 --> 00:11:03,372
 I would give

156
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:05,296
25 And now, if ye say this in your hearts ye

157
00:11:05,296 --> 00:11:07,296
 remain guiltless, otherwise ye are condemned; and your

158
00:11:07,296 --> 00:11:09,296
 condemnation is just for ye covet that which ye

159
00:11:09,296 --> 00:11:11,296
 have not received

160
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:13,049
26 And now, for the sake of these things which I

161
00:11:13,049 --> 00:11:14,827
 have spoken unto you—that is, for the sake of

162
00:11:14,827 --> 00:11:16,605
 retaining a remission of your sins from day to day,

163
00:11:16,605 --> 00:11:18,383
 that ye may walk guiltless before God—I would that ye

164
00:11:18,383 --> 00:11:20,161
 should impart of your substance to the poor,

165
00:11:20,161 --> 00:11:21,939
 every man according to that which he hath, such as

166
00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:23,717
 feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, visiting the

167
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:25,495
 sick and administering to their relief, both

168
00:11:25,495 --> 00:11:27,273
 spiritually and temporally, according to their wants

169
00:11:27,22 --> 00:11:29,887
27 And see that all these things are done in

170
00:11:29,887 --> 00:11:32,554
 wisdom and order; for it is not requisite that a man

171
00:11:32,554 --> 00:11:35,221
 should run faster than he has strength. And again,

172
00:11:35,221 --> 00:11:37,888
 it is expedient that he should be diligent, that

173
00:11:37,888 --> 00:11:40,555
 thereby he might win the prize; therefore, all

174
00:11:40,555 --> 00:11:43,222
 things must be done in order

175
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,836
28 And I would that ye should remember, that

176
00:11:45,836 --> 00:11:48,503
 whosoever among you borroweth of his neighbor should

177
00:11:48,503 --> 00:11:51,17
 return the thing that he borroweth, according as he

178
00:11:51,17 --> 00:11:53,837
 doth agree, or else thou shalt commit sin; and

179
00:11:53,837 --> 00:11:56,504
 perhaps thou shalt cause thy neighbor to commit sin

180
00:11:56,504 --> 00:11:59,171
 also

181
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:03,118
29 And finally, I cannot tell you all the things

182
00:12:03,118 --> 00:12:07,118
 whereby ye may commit sin; for there are divers

183
00:12:07,118 --> 00:12:11,118
 ways and means, even so many that I cannot number

184
00:12:11,118 --> 00:12:15,118
 them

185
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:15,068
30 But this much I can tell you, that if ye do not

186
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:15,068
 watch yourselves, and your thoughts, and your

187
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:15,068
 words, and your deeds, and observe the commandments

188
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:15,068
 of God, and continue in the faith of what ye have

189
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:15,068
 heard concerning the coming of our Lord, even unto

190
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:15,068
 the end of your lives, ye must perish. And now, O

191
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:15,068
 man, remember, and perish not.
