00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:03,0
Chapter 25 The descendants of Mulek at

2
00:00:03,0 --> 00:00:06,0
Zarahemla become Nephites—They learn of the

3
00:00:06,0 --> 00:00:09,0
people of Alma and of Zeniff—Alma baptizes Limhi

4
00:00:09,0 --> 00:00:12,0
and all his people—Mosiah authorizes Alma to

5
00:00:12,0 --> 00:00:15,482
organize the Church of God. About 120 B.C. 

6
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:21,982
1 And now king Mosiah caused that all

7
00:00:21,982 --> 00:00:28,862
the people should be gathered together.

8
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:32,195
2 Now there were not so many of the

9
00:00:32,195 --> 00:00:35,528
children of Nephi, or so many of those

10
00:00:35,528 --> 00:00:38,861
who were descendants of Nephi, as

11
00:00:38,861 --> 00:00:42,194
there were of the people of Zarahemla,

12
00:00:42,194 --> 00:00:45,527
who was a descendant of Mulek, and

13
00:00:45,527 --> 00:00:48,248
those who came with him into the wilderness.

14
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:48,048
3 And there were not so many

15
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:47,848
of the people of Nephi and of

16
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:47,648
the people of Zarahemla as

17
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:47,448
there were of the Lamanites; yea,

18
00:00:47,448 --> 00:00:47,314
they were not half so numerous.

19
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:47,114
4 And now all the people of

20
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:46,914
Nephi were assembled

21
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:46,714
together, and also all the people

22
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:46,514
of Zarahemla, and they were

23
00:00:46,514 --> 00:00:46,38
gathered together in two bodies.

24
00:00:46,38 --> 00:00:46,602
5 And it came to pass

25
00:00:46,602 --> 00:00:46,824
that Mosiah did read, and

26
00:00:46,824 --> 00:00:47,046
caused to be read, the

27
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:47,268
records of Zeniff to his

28
00:00:47,268 --> 00:00:47,49
people; yea, he read the

29
00:00:47,49 --> 00:00:47,712
records of the people of

30
00:00:47,712 --> 00:00:47,934
Zeniff, from the time they

31
00:00:47,934 --> 00:00:48,156
left the land of Zarahemla

32
00:00:48,156 --> 00:00:48,782
until they returned again.

33
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:48,639
6 And he also read the

34
00:00:48,639 --> 00:00:48,496
account of Alma and his

35
00:00:48,496 --> 00:00:48,353
brethren, and all

36
00:00:48,353 --> 00:00:48,21
their afflictions, from the

37
00:00:48,21 --> 00:00:48,067
time they left the

38
00:00:48,067 --> 00:00:47,924
land of Zarahemla until

39
00:00:47,924 --> 00:00:47,848
the time they returned again.

40
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:47,681
7 And now, when Mosiah

41
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:47,514
had made an end of

42
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:47,347
reading the records, his

43
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:47,18
people who tarried in

44
00:00:47,18 --> 00:00:47,013
the land were struck

45
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:46,914
with wonder and amazement.

46
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:46,771
8 For they knew not

47
00:00:46,771 --> 00:00:46,628
what to think; for

48
00:00:46,628 --> 00:00:46,485
when they beheld

49
00:00:46,485 --> 00:00:46,342
those that had been

50
00:00:46,342 --> 00:00:46,199
delivered out of bondage

51
00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:46,056
they were filled

52
00:00:46,056 --> 00:00:45,979
with exceedingly great joy.

53
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:46,354
9 And again, when

54
00:00:46,354 --> 00:00:46,729
they thought of

55
00:00:46,729 --> 00:00:47,104
their brethren who

56
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:47,479
had been slain by

57
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:47,854
the Lamanites they

58
00:00:47,854 --> 00:00:48,229
were filled with

59
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:48,604
sorrow, and even

60
00:00:48,604 --> 00:00:48,382
shed many tears of sorrow.

61
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:48,305
10 And again,

62
00:00:48,305 --> 00:00:48,228
when they thought

63
00:00:48,228 --> 00:00:48,151
of the immediate

64
00:00:48,151 --> 00:00:48,074
goodness of

65
00:00:48,074 --> 00:00:47,997
God, and his power

66
00:00:47,997 --> 00:00:47,92
in delivering

67
00:00:47,92 --> 00:00:47,843
Alma and his

68
00:00:47,843 --> 00:00:47,766
brethren out of the

69
00:00:47,766 --> 00:00:47,689
hands of the

70
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:47,612
Lamanites and of

71
00:00:47,612 --> 00:00:47,535
bondage, they did

72
00:00:47,535 --> 00:00:47,458
raise their

73
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:47,447
voices and give thanks to God.

74
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:47,364
11 And again,

75
00:00:47,364 --> 00:00:47,281
when they

76
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:47,198
thought upon the

77
00:00:47,198 --> 00:00:47,115
Lamanites, who were

78
00:00:47,115 --> 00:00:47,032
their

79
00:00:47,032 --> 00:00:46,949
brethren, of their

80
00:00:46,949 --> 00:00:46,866
sinful and polluted

81
00:00:46,866 --> 00:00:46,783
state, they

82
00:00:46,783 --> 00:00:46,7
were filled with

83
00:00:46,7 --> 00:00:46,617
pain and

84
00:00:46,617 --> 00:00:46,534
anguish for the

85
00:00:46,534 --> 00:00:46,513
welfare of their souls.

86
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:46,549
12 And it came

87
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:46,585
to pass that

88
00:00:46,585 --> 00:00:46,621
those who were

89
00:00:46,621 --> 00:00:46,657
the children

90
00:00:46,657 --> 00:00:46,693
of Amulon and

91
00:00:46,693 --> 00:00:46,729
his brethren,

92
00:00:46,729 --> 00:00:46,765
who had taken

93
00:00:46,765 --> 00:00:46,801
to wife the

94
00:00:46,801 --> 00:00:46,837
daughters of the

95
00:00:46,837 --> 00:00:46,873
Lamanites,

96
00:00:46,873 --> 00:00:46,909
were displeased

97
00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:46,945
with the

98
00:00:46,945 --> 00:00:46,981
conduct of their

99
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:47,017
fathers, and

100
00:00:47,017 --> 00:00:47,053
they would no

101
00:00:47,053 --> 00:00:47,089
longer be called

102
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:47,125
by the names

103
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:47,161
of their

104
00:00:47,161 --> 00:00:47,197
fathers, therefore

105
00:00:47,197 --> 00:00:47,233
they took upon

106
00:00:47,233 --> 00:00:47,269
themselves the

107
00:00:47,269 --> 00:00:47,305
name of

108
00:00:47,305 --> 00:00:47,341
Nephi, that they

109
00:00:47,341 --> 00:00:47,377
might be called

110
00:00:47,377 --> 00:00:47,413
the children

111
00:00:47,413 --> 00:00:47,449
of Nephi and be

112
00:00:47,449 --> 00:00:47,485
numbered

113
00:00:47,485 --> 00:00:47,981
among those who were called Nephites.

114
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:47,981
13 And now

115
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:47,981
all the people

116
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:47,981
of Zarahemla

117
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:47,981
were numbered

118
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:47,981
with the

119
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:47,981
Nephites, and

120
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:47,981
this because

121
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:47,981
the kingdom had

122
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:47,981
been

123
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:47,981
conferred upon none

124
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:47,981
but those who

125
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:47,981
were

126
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:47,047
descendants of Nephi.

127
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:46,964
14 And now

128
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:46,881
it came to

129
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:46,798
pass that when

130
00:00:46,798 --> 00:00:46,715
Mosiah had

131
00:00:46,715 --> 00:00:46,632
made an end

132
00:00:46,632 --> 00:00:46,549
of speaking

133
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:46,466
and reading

134
00:00:46,466 --> 00:00:46,383
to the

135
00:00:46,383 --> 00:00:46,3
people, he

136
00:00:46,3 --> 00:00:46,217
desired that Alma

137
00:00:46,217 --> 00:00:46,134
should also

138
00:00:46,134 --> 00:00:46,113
speak to the people.

139
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:46,238
15 And Alma

140
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:46,363
did speak

141
00:00:46,363 --> 00:00:46,488
unto them,

142
00:00:46,488 --> 00:00:46,613
when they

143
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:46,738
were

144
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:46,863
assembled together

145
00:00:46,863 --> 00:00:46,988
in large

146
00:00:46,988 --> 00:00:47,113
bodies, and

147
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:47,238
he went

148
00:00:47,238 --> 00:00:47,363
from one body

149
00:00:47,363 --> 00:00:47,488
to another,

150
00:00:47,488 --> 00:00:47,613
preaching

151
00:00:47,613 --> 00:00:47,738
unto the

152
00:00:47,738 --> 00:00:47,863
people

153
00:00:47,863 --> 00:00:47,988
repentance and

154
00:00:47,988 --> 00:00:48,048
faith on the Lord.

155
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:47,989
16 And he

156
00:00:47,989 --> 00:00:47,93
did exhort

157
00:00:47,93 --> 00:00:47,871
the

158
00:00:47,871 --> 00:00:47,812
people of Limhi

159
00:00:47,812 --> 00:00:47,753
and his

160
00:00:47,753 --> 00:00:47,694
brethren,

161
00:00:47,694 --> 00:00:47,635
all those

162
00:00:47,635 --> 00:00:47,576
that had

163
00:00:47,576 --> 00:00:47,517
been

164
00:00:47,517 --> 00:00:47,458
delivered out of

165
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:47,399
bondage,

166
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:47,34
that they

167
00:00:47,34 --> 00:00:47,281
should

168
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:47,222
remember that

169
00:00:47,222 --> 00:00:47,163
it was the

170
00:00:47,163 --> 00:00:47,104
Lord that

171
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:47,114
did deliver them.

172
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:47,072
17 And it

173
00:00:47,072 --> 00:00:47,03
came to

174
00:00:47,03 --> 00:00:46,988
pass that

175
00:00:46,988 --> 00:00:46,946
after

176
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:46,904
Alma had

177
00:00:46,904 --> 00:00:46,862
taught the

178
00:00:46,862 --> 00:00:46,82
people

179
00:00:46,82 --> 00:00:46,778
many

180
00:00:46,778 --> 00:00:46,736
things, and had

181
00:00:46,736 --> 00:00:46,694
made an

182
00:00:46,694 --> 00:00:46,652
end of

183
00:00:46,652 --> 00:00:46,61
speaking to

184
00:00:46,61 --> 00:00:46,568
them,

185
00:00:46,568 --> 00:00:46,526
that king

186
00:00:46,526 --> 00:00:46,484
Limhi was

187
00:00:46,484 --> 00:00:46,442
desirous

188
00:00:46,442 --> 00:00:46,4
that he

189
00:00:46,4 --> 00:00:46,358
might be

190
00:00:46,358 --> 00:00:46,316
baptized;

191
00:00:46,316 --> 00:00:46,274
and all

192
00:00:46,274 --> 00:00:46,232
his people

193
00:00:46,232 --> 00:00:46,19
were

194
00:00:46,19 --> 00:00:46,148
desirous

195
00:00:46,148 --> 00:00:46,179
that they might be baptized also.

196
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:46,244
18

197
00:00:46,244 --> 00:00:46,309
Therefore,

198
00:00:46,309 --> 00:00:46,374
Alma did

199
00:00:46,374 --> 00:00:46,439
go forth

200
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:46,504
into the

201
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:46,569
water

202
00:00:46,569 --> 00:00:46,634
and did

203
00:00:46,634 --> 00:00:46,699
baptize

204
