00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 25 The descendants of Mulek at

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Zarahemla become Nephites—They learn of the

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
people of Alma and of Zeniff—Alma baptizes Limhi

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and all his people—Mosiah authorizes Alma to

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:11:28,
organize the Church of God. About 120 B.C. 

6
00:11:28,0 --> 00:11:28,0
1 And now king Mosiah caused that all

7
00:11:28,0 --> 00:11:00,
the people should be gathered together.

8
00:11:00,0 --> 00:11:00,0
2 Now there were not so many of the

9
00:11:00,0 --> 00:11:00,0
children of Nephi, or so many of those

10
00:11:00,0 --> 00:11:00,0
who were descendants of Nephi, as

11
00:11:00,0 --> 00:11:00,0
there were of the people of Zarahemla,

12
00:11:00,0 --> 00:11:00,0
who was a descendant of Mulek, and

13
00:11:00,0 --> 00:15:43,
those who came with him into the wilderness.

14
00:15:43,0 --> 00:15:43,0
3 And there were not so many

15
00:15:43,0 --> 00:15:43,0
of the people of Nephi and of

16
00:15:43,0 --> 00:15:43,0
the people of Zarahemla as

17
00:15:43,0 --> 00:15:43,0
there were of the Lamanites; yea,

18
00:15:43,0 --> 00:16:13,
they were not half so numerous.

19
00:16:13,0 --> 00:16:13,0
4 And now all the people of

20
00:16:13,0 --> 00:16:13,0
Nephi were assembled

21
00:16:13,0 --> 00:16:13,0
together, and also all the people

22
00:16:13,0 --> 00:16:13,0
of Zarahemla, and they were

23
00:16:13,0 --> 00:23:07,
gathered together in two bodies.

24
00:23:07,0 --> 00:23:07,0
5 And it came to pass

25
00:23:07,0 --> 00:23:07,0
that Mosiah did read, and

26
00:23:07,0 --> 00:23:07,0
caused to be read, the

27
00:23:07,0 --> 00:23:07,0
records of Zeniff to his

28
00:23:07,0 --> 00:23:07,0
people; yea, he read the

29
00:23:07,0 --> 00:23:07,0
records of the people of

30
00:23:07,0 --> 00:23:07,0
Zeniff, from the time they

31
00:23:07,0 --> 00:23:07,0
left the land of Zarahemla

32
00:23:07,0 --> 00:25:05,
until they returned again.

33
00:25:05,0 --> 00:25:05,0
6 And he also read the

34
00:25:05,0 --> 00:25:05,0
account of Alma and his

35
00:25:05,0 --> 00:25:05,0
brethren, and all

36
00:25:05,0 --> 00:25:05,0
their afflictions, from the

37
00:25:05,0 --> 00:25:05,0
time they left the

38
00:25:05,0 --> 00:25:05,0
land of Zarahemla until

39
00:25:05,0 --> 00:24:37,
the time they returned again.

40
00:24:37,0 --> 00:24:37,0
7 And now, when Mosiah

41
00:24:37,0 --> 00:24:37,0
had made an end of

42
00:24:37,0 --> 00:24:37,0
reading the records, his

43
00:24:37,0 --> 00:24:37,0
people who tarried in

44
00:24:37,0 --> 00:24:37,0
the land were struck

45
00:24:37,0 --> 00:24:09,
with wonder and amazement.

46
00:24:09,0 --> 00:24:09,0
8 For they knew not

47
00:24:09,0 --> 00:24:09,0
what to think; for

48
00:24:09,0 --> 00:24:09,0
when they beheld

49
00:24:09,0 --> 00:24:09,0
those that had been

50
00:24:09,0 --> 00:24:09,0
delivered out of bondage

51
00:24:09,0 --> 00:24:09,0
they were filled

52
00:24:09,0 --> 00:23:41,
with exceedingly great joy.

53
00:23:41,0 --> 00:23:41,0
9 And again, when

54
00:23:41,0 --> 00:23:41,0
they thought of

55
00:23:41,0 --> 00:23:41,0
their brethren who

56
00:23:41,0 --> 00:23:41,0
had been slain by

57
00:23:41,0 --> 00:23:41,0
the Lamanites they

58
00:23:41,0 --> 00:23:41,0
were filled with

59
00:23:41,0 --> 00:23:41,0
sorrow, and even

60
00:23:41,0 --> 00:23:13,
shed many tears of sorrow.

61
00:23:13,0 --> 00:23:13,0
10 And again,

62
00:23:13,0 --> 00:23:13,0
when they thought

63
00:23:13,0 --> 00:23:13,0
of the immediate

64
00:23:13,0 --> 00:23:13,0
goodness of

65
00:23:13,0 --> 00:23:13,0
God, and his power

66
00:23:13,0 --> 00:23:13,0
in delivering

67
00:23:13,0 --> 00:23:13,0
Alma and his

68
00:23:13,0 --> 00:23:13,0
brethren out of the

69
00:23:13,0 --> 00:23:13,0
hands of the

70
00:23:13,0 --> 00:23:13,0
Lamanites and of

71
00:23:13,0 --> 00:23:13,0
bondage, they did

72
00:23:13,0 --> 00:23:13,0
raise their

73
00:23:13,0 --> 00:23:57,
voices and give thanks to God.

74
00:23:57,0 --> 00:23:57,0
11 And again,

75
00:23:57,0 --> 00:23:57,0
when they

76
00:23:57,0 --> 00:23:57,0
thought upon the

77
00:23:57,0 --> 00:23:57,0
Lamanites, who were

78
00:23:57,0 --> 00:23:57,0
their

79
00:23:57,0 --> 00:23:57,0
brethren, of their

80
00:23:57,0 --> 00:23:57,0
sinful and polluted

81
00:23:57,0 --> 00:23:57,0
state, they

82
00:23:57,0 --> 00:23:57,0
were filled with

83
00:23:57,0 --> 00:23:57,0
pain and

84
00:23:57,0 --> 00:23:57,0
anguish for the

85
00:23:57,0 --> 00:23:29,
welfare of their souls.

86
00:23:29,0 --> 00:23:29,0
12 And it came

87
00:23:29,0 --> 00:23:29,0
to pass that

88
00:23:29,0 --> 00:23:29,0
those who were

89
00:23:29,0 --> 00:23:29,0
the children

90
00:23:29,0 --> 00:23:29,0
of Amulon and

91
00:23:29,0 --> 00:23:29,0
his brethren,

92
00:23:29,0 --> 00:23:29,0
who had taken

93
00:23:29,0 --> 00:23:29,0
to wife the

94
00:23:29,0 --> 00:23:29,0
daughters of the

95
00:23:29,0 --> 00:23:29,0
Lamanites,

96
00:23:29,0 --> 00:23:29,0
were displeased

97
00:23:29,0 --> 00:23:29,0
with the

98
00:23:29,0 --> 00:23:29,0
conduct of their

99
00:23:29,0 --> 00:23:29,0
fathers, and

100
00:23:29,0 --> 00:23:29,0
they would no

101
00:23:29,0 --> 00:23:29,0
longer be called

102
00:23:29,0 --> 00:23:29,0
by the names

103
00:23:29,0 --> 00:23:29,0
of their

104
00:23:29,0 --> 00:23:29,0
fathers, therefore

105
00:23:29,0 --> 00:23:29,0
they took upon

106
00:23:29,0 --> 00:23:29,0
themselves the

107
00:23:29,0 --> 00:23:29,0
name of

108
00:23:29,0 --> 00:23:29,0
Nephi, that they

109
00:23:29,0 --> 00:23:29,0
might be called

110
00:23:29,0 --> 00:23:29,0
the children

111
00:23:29,0 --> 00:23:29,0
of Nephi and be

112
00:23:29,0 --> 00:23:29,0
numbered

113
00:23:29,0 --> 00:24:41,
among those who were called Nephites.

114
00:24:41,0 --> 00:24:41,0
13 And now

115
00:24:41,0 --> 00:24:41,0
all the people

116
00:24:41,0 --> 00:24:41,0
of Zarahemla

117
00:24:41,0 --> 00:24:41,0
were numbered

118
00:24:41,0 --> 00:24:41,0
with the

119
00:24:41,0 --> 00:24:41,0
Nephites, and

120
00:24:41,0 --> 00:24:41,0
this because

121
00:24:41,0 --> 00:24:41,0
the kingdom had

122
00:24:41,0 --> 00:24:41,0
been

123
00:24:41,0 --> 00:24:41,0
conferred upon none

124
00:24:41,0 --> 00:24:41,0
but those who

125
00:24:41,0 --> 00:24:41,0
were

126
00:24:41,0 --> 00:24:13,
descendants of Nephi.

127
00:24:13,0 --> 00:24:13,0
14 And now

128
00:24:13,0 --> 00:24:13,0
it came to

129
00:24:13,0 --> 00:24:13,0
pass that when

130
00:24:13,0 --> 00:24:13,0
Mosiah had

131
00:24:13,0 --> 00:24:13,0
made an end

132
00:24:13,0 --> 00:24:13,0
of speaking

133
00:24:13,0 --> 00:24:13,0
and reading

134
00:24:13,0 --> 00:24:13,0
to the

135
00:24:13,0 --> 00:24:13,0
people, he

136
00:24:13,0 --> 00:24:13,0
desired that Alma

137
00:24:13,0 --> 00:24:13,0
should also

138
00:24:13,0 --> 00:23:45,
speak to the people.

139
00:23:45,0 --> 00:23:45,0
15 And Alma

140
00:23:45,0 --> 00:23:45,0
did speak

141
00:23:45,0 --> 00:23:45,0
unto them,

142
00:23:45,0 --> 00:23:45,0
when they

143
00:23:45,0 --> 00:23:45,0
were

144
00:23:45,0 --> 00:23:45,0
assembled together

145
00:23:45,0 --> 00:23:45,0
in large

146
00:23:45,0 --> 00:23:45,0
bodies, and

147
00:23:45,0 --> 00:23:45,0
he went

148
00:23:45,0 --> 00:23:45,0
from one body

149
00:23:45,0 --> 00:23:45,0
to another,

150
00:23:45,0 --> 00:23:45,0
preaching

151
00:23:45,0 --> 00:23:45,0
unto the

152
00:23:45,0 --> 00:23:45,0
people

153
00:23:45,0 --> 00:23:45,0
repentance and

154
00:23:45,0 --> 00:23:17,
faith on the Lord.

155
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
16 And he

156
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
did exhort

157
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
the

158
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
people of Limhi

159
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
and his

160
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
brethren,

161
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
all those

162
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
that had

163
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
been

164
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
delivered out of

165
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
bondage,

166
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
that they

167
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
should

168
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
remember that

169
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
it was the

170
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
Lord that

171
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:31,
did deliver them.

172
00:23:31,0 --> 00:23:31,0
17 And it

173
00:23:31,0 --> 00:23:31,0
came to

174
00:23:31,0 --> 00:23:31,0
pass that

175
00:23:31,0 --> 00:23:31,0
after

176
00:23:31,0 --> 00:23:31,0
Alma had

177
00:23:31,0 --> 00:23:31,0
taught the

178
00:23:31,0 --> 00:23:31,0
people

179
00:23:31,0 --> 00:23:31,0
many

180
00:23:31,0 --> 00:23:31,0
things, and had

181
00:23:31,0 --> 00:23:31,0
made an

182
00:23:31,0 --> 00:23:31,0
end of

183
00:23:31,0 --> 00:23:31,0
speaking to

184
00:23:31,0 --> 00:23:31,0
them,

185
00:23:31,0 --> 00:23:31,0
that king

186
00:23:31,0 --> 00:23:31,0
Limhi was

187
00:23:31,0 --> 00:23:31,0
desirous

188
00:23:31,0 --> 00:23:31,0
that he

189
00:23:31,0 --> 00:23:31,0
might be

190
00:23:31,0 --> 00:23:31,0
baptized;

191
00:23:31,0 --> 00:23:31,0
and all

192
00:23:31,0 --> 00:23:31,0
his people

193
00:23:31,0 --> 00:23:31,0
were

194
00:23:31,0 --> 00:23:31,0
desirous

195
00:23:31,0 --> 00:23:17,
that they might be baptized also.

196
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
18

197
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
Therefore,

198
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
Alma did

199
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
go forth

200
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
into the

201
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
water

202
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
and did

203
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
baptize

204
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
them;

205
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
yea, he did

206
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
baptize

207
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
them

208
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
after the

209
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
manner

210
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
he did

211
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
his

212
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
brethren in

213
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
the waters

214
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
of

215
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
Mormon; yea,

216
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
and as

217
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
many as

218
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
he did

219
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
baptize

220
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
did

221
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
belong to the

222
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
church

223
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
of God;

224
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
and this

225
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
because

226
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:31,

261
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
that

262
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
they

263
00:23:17,0 --> 00:23:17,0
