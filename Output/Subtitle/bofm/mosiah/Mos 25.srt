00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:04,6
Chapter 25 The descendants of Mulek at Zarahemla

2
00:00:04,6 --> 00:00:09,2
 become Nephites—They learn of the people of Alma

3
00:00:09,2 --> 00:00:13,8
 and of Zeniff—Alma baptizes Limhi and all his

4
00:00:13,8 --> 00:00:18,4
 people—Mosiah authorizes Alma to organize the Church of

5
00:00:18,4 --> 00:00:23,0
 God. About 120 B.C.

6
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:31,924
1 And now king Mosiah caused that all the people

7
00:00:31,924 --> 00:00:39,924
 should be gathered together

8
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,473
2 Now there were not so many of the children of

9
00:00:41,473 --> 00:00:43,073
 Nephi, or so many of those who were descendants of

10
00:00:43,073 --> 00:00:44,673
 Nephi, as there were of the people of Zarahemla,

11
00:00:44,673 --> 00:00:46,273
 who was a descendant of Mulek, and those who came

12
00:00:46,273 --> 00:00:47,873
 with him into the wilderness

13
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,848
3 And there were not so many of the people of

14
00:00:49,848 --> 00:00:51,848
 Nephi and of the people of Zarahemla as there were of

15
00:00:51,848 --> 00:00:53,848
 the Lamanites; yea, they were not half so

16
00:00:53,848 --> 00:00:55,848
 numerous

17
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:58,489
4 And now all the people of Nephi were assembled

18
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:01,156
 together, and also all the people of Zarahemla, and

19
00:01:01,156 --> 00:01:03,823
 they were gathered together in two bodies

20
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,397
5 And it came to pass that Mosiah did read, and

21
00:01:05,397 --> 00:01:06,997
 caused to be read, the records of Zeniff to his

22
00:01:06,997 --> 00:01:08,597
 people; yea, he read the records of the people of

23
00:01:08,597 --> 00:01:10,197
 Zeniff, from the time they left the land of Zarahemla

24
00:01:10,197 --> 00:01:11,797
 until they returned again

25
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:13,772
6 And he also read the account of Alma and his

26
00:01:13,772 --> 00:01:15,772
 brethren, and all their afflictions, from the time

27
00:01:15,772 --> 00:01:17,772
 they left the land of Zarahemla until the time they

28
00:01:17,772 --> 00:01:19,772
 returned again

29
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,413
7 And now, when Mosiah had made an end of reading

30
00:01:22,413 --> 00:01:25,08
 the records, his people who tarried in the land

31
00:01:25,08 --> 00:01:27,747
 were struck with wonder and amazement

32
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:30,388
8 For they knew not what to think; for when they

33
00:01:30,388 --> 00:01:33,055
 beheld those that had been delivered out of bondage

34
00:01:33,055 --> 00:01:35,722
 they were filled with exceedingly great joy

35
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,696
9 And again, when they thought of their brethren

36
00:01:37,696 --> 00:01:39,696
 who had been slain by the Lamanites they were

37
00:01:39,696 --> 00:01:41,696
 filled with sorrow, and even shed many tears of sorrow

38
00:01:41,696 --> 00:01:43,696


39
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:46,87
10 And again, when they thought of the immediate

40
00:01:46,87 --> 00:01:50,07
 goodness of God, and his power in delivering Alma

41
00:01:50,07 --> 00:01:53,27
 and his brethren out of the hands of the Lamanites

42
00:01:53,27 --> 00:01:56,47
 and of bondage, they did raise their voices and

43
00:01:56,47 --> 00:01:59,67
 give thanks to God

44
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:03,62
11 And again, when they thought upon the

45
00:02:03,62 --> 00:02:07,62
 Lamanites, who were their brethren, of their sinful and

46
00:02:07,62 --> 00:02:11,62
 polluted state, they were filled with pain and

47
00:02:11,62 --> 00:02:15,62
 anguish for the welfare of their souls

48
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:16,458
12 And it came to pass that those who were the

49
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:17,347
 children of Amulon and his brethren, who had taken to

50
00:02:17,347 --> 00:02:18,236
 wife the daughters of the Lamanites, were

51
00:02:18,236 --> 00:02:19,125
 displeased with the conduct of their fathers, and they

52
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:20,014
 would no longer be called by the names of their

53
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:20,903
 fathers, therefore they took upon themselves the name

54
00:02:20,903 --> 00:02:21,792
 of Nephi, that they might be called the children

55
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:22,681
 of Nephi and be numbered among those who were

56
00:02:22,681 --> 00:02:23,57
 called Nephites

57
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,543
13 And now all the people of Zarahemla were

58
00:02:25,543 --> 00:02:27,543
 numbered with the Nephites, and this because the kingdom

59
00:02:27,543 --> 00:02:29,543
 had been conferred upon none but those who were

60
00:02:29,543 --> 00:02:31,543
 descendants of Nephi

61
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,518
14 And now it came to pass that when Mosiah had

62
00:02:33,518 --> 00:02:35,518
 made an end of speaking and reading to the people,

63
00:02:35,518 --> 00:02:37,518
 he desired that Alma should also speak to the

64
00:02:37,518 --> 00:02:39,518
 people

65
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,493
15 And Alma did speak unto them, when they were

66
00:02:41,493 --> 00:02:43,493
 assembled together in large bodies, and he went from

67
00:02:43,493 --> 00:02:45,493
 one body to another, preaching unto the people

68
00:02:45,493 --> 00:02:47,493
 repentance and faith on the Lord

69
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,467
16 And he did exhort the people of Limhi and his

70
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:51,467
 brethren, all those that had been delivered out of

71
00:02:51,467 --> 00:02:53,467
 bondage, that they should remember that it was the

72
00:02:53,467 --> 00:02:55,467
 Lord that did deliver them

73
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:57,042
17 And it came to pass that after Alma had taught

74
00:02:57,042 --> 00:02:58,642
 the people many things, and had made an end of

75
00:02:58,642 --> 00:03:00,242
 speaking to them, that king Limhi was desirous that

76
00:03:00,242 --> 00:03:01,842
 he might be baptized; and all his people were

77
00:03:01,842 --> 00:03:03,442
 desirous that they might be baptized also

78
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:04,75
18 Therefore, Alma did go forth into the water and

79
00:03:04,75 --> 00:03:06,083
 did baptize them; yea, he did baptize them after

80
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,416
 the manner he did his brethren in the waters of

81
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:08,749
 Mormon; yea, and as many as he did baptize did

82
00:03:08,749 --> 00:03:10,082
 belong to the church of God; and this because of their

83
00:03:10,082 --> 00:03:11,415
 belief on the words of Alma

84
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,391
19 And it came to pass that king Mosiah granted

85
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:15,391
 unto Alma that he might establish churches

86
00:03:15,391 --> 00:03:17,391
 throughout all the land of Zarahemla; and gave him power to

87
00:03:17,391 --> 00:03:19,391
 ordain priests and teachers over every church

88
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,366
20 Now this was done because there were so many

89
00:03:21,366 --> 00:03:23,366
 people that they could not all be governed by one

90
00:03:23,366 --> 00:03:25,366
 teacher; neither could they all hear the word of God

91
00:03:25,366 --> 00:03:27,366
 in one assembly

92
00:03:27,34 --> 00:03:28,94
21 Therefore they did assemble themselves together

93
00:03:28,94 --> 00:03:30,54
 in different bodies, being called churches; every

94
00:03:30,54 --> 00:03:32,14
 church having their priests and their teachers,

95
00:03:32,14 --> 00:03:33,74
 and every priest preaching the word according as it

96
00:03:33,74 --> 00:03:35,34
 was delivered to him by the mouth of Alma

97
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:36,915
22 And thus, notwithstanding there being many

98
00:03:36,915 --> 00:03:38,515
 churches they were all one church, yea, even the

99
00:03:38,515 --> 00:03:40,115
 church of God; for there was nothing preached in all

100
00:03:40,115 --> 00:03:41,715
 the churches except it were repentance and faith in

101
00:03:41,715 --> 00:03:43,315
 God

102
00:03:43,29 --> 00:03:45,29
23 And now there were seven churches in the land

103
00:03:45,29 --> 00:03:47,29
 of Zarahemla. And it came to pass that whosoever

104
00:03:47,29 --> 00:03:49,29
 were desirous to take upon them the name of Christ,

105
00:03:49,29 --> 00:03:51,29
 or of God, they did join the churches of God

106
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,597
24 And they were called the people of God. And the

107
00:03:53,597 --> 00:03:55,93
 Lord did pour out his Spirit upon them, and they

108
00:03:55,93 --> 00:03:58,263
 were blessed, and prospered in the land.
