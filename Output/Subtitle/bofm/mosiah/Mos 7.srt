00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 7 Ammon finds the land of Lehi-Nephi,

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
where Limhi is king—Limhi’s people are in bondage to

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Lamanites—Limhi recounts their history—A

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
prophet (Abinadi) had testified that Christ is the

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
God and Father of all things—Those who sow

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
filthiness reap the whirlwind, and those who put their

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:11:43,
trust in the Lord will be delivered. About 121 B.C. 

8
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
1 And now, it came to pass that after king

9
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
Mosiah had had continual peace for the space of

10
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
three years, he was desirous to know

11
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
concerning the people who went up to dwell in the

12
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
land of Lehi-Nephi, or in the city of

13
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
Lehi-Nephi; for his people had heard nothing from them

14
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
from the time they left the land of

15
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:57,
Zarahemla; therefore, they wearied him with their teasings.

16
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
2 And it came to pass that king Mosiah

17
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
granted that sixteen of their strong

18
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
men might go up to the land of

19
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:43,
Lehi-Nephi, to inquire concerning their brethren.

20
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
3 And it came to pass that on the

21
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
morrow they started to go up, having

22
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
with them one Ammon, he being a strong

23
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
and mighty man, and a descendant of

24
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:57,
Zarahemla; and he was also their leader.

25
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
4 And now, they knew not the

26
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
course they should travel in the

27
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
wilderness to go up to the land of

28
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
Lehi-Nephi; therefore they

29
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
wandered many days in the

30
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:43,
wilderness, even forty days did they wander.

31
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
5 And when they had

32
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
wandered forty days they came to

33
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
a hill, which is north of

34
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
the land of Shilom, and

35
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:57,
there they pitched their tents.

36
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
6 And Ammon took three of

37
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
his brethren, and their

38
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
names were Amaleki,

39
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
Helem, and Hem, and they went

40
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:43,
down into the land of Nephi.

41
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
7 And behold, they met

42
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
the king of the people

43
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
who were in the land of

44
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
Nephi, and in the land

45
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
of Shilom; and they

46
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
were surrounded by the

47
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
king’s guard, and were

48
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
taken, and were bound,

49
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:57,
and were committed to prison.

50
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
8 And it came to pass

51
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
when they had been in

52
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
prison two days they

53
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
were again brought

54
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
before the king, and their

55
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
bands were loosed;

56
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
and they stood before

57
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
the king, and were

58
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
permitted, or rather

59
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
commanded, that they should

60
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
answer the questions

61
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:43,
which he should ask them.

62
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
9 And he said unto

63
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
them: Behold, I am

64
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
Limhi, the son of Noah,

65
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
who was the son of

66
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
Zeniff, who came up out

67
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
of the land of

68
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
Zarahemla to inherit this

69
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
land, which was the

70
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
land of their fathers,

71
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
who was made a king

72
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:57,
by the voice of the people.

73
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
10 And now, I

74
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
desire to know the cause

75
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
whereby ye were so

76
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
bold as to come

77
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
near the walls of the

78
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
city, when I,

79
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
myself, was with my

80
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:43,
guards without the gate?

81
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
11 And now, for

82
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
this cause have I

83
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
suffered that ye

84
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
should be preserved,

85
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
that I might

86
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
inquire of you, or else

87
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
I should have

88
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
caused that my guards

89
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
should have put

90
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
you to death. Ye

91
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:57,
are permitted to speak.

92
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
12 And now, when

93
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
Ammon saw that he

94
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
was permitted to

95
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
speak, he went

96
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
forth and bowed

97
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
himself before the

98
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
king; and rising

99
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
again he said: O

100
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
king, I am very

101
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
thankful before

102
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
God this day that I

103
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
am yet alive,

104
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
and am permitted to

105
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
speak; and I

106
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
will endeavor to

107
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:43,
speak with boldness;

108
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
13 For I am

109
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
assured that if ye

110
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
had known me ye

111
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
would not have

112
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
suffered that I

113
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
should have worn

114
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
these bands. For

115
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
I am Ammon, and

116
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
am a descendant

117
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
of Zarahemla,

118
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
and have come up

119
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
out of the land

120
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
of Zarahemla to

121
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
inquire

122
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
concerning our brethren,

123
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
whom Zeniff

124
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:57,
brought up out of that land.

125
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
14 And now, it

126
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
came to pass

127
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
that after Limhi

128
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
had heard the

129
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
words of Ammon,

130
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
he was

131
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
exceedingly glad, and

132
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
said: Now, I

133
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
know of a surety

134
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
that my brethren

135
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
who were in

136
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
the land of

137
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
Zarahemla are yet

138
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
alive. And now, I

139
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
will rejoice;

140
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
and on the

141
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
morrow I will cause

142
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
that my people

143
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:43,
shall rejoice also.

144
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
15 For behold,

145
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
we are in

146
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
bondage to the

147
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
Lamanites, and

148
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
are taxed with

149
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
a tax which is

150
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
grievous to

151
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
be borne. And

152
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
now, behold,

153
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
our brethren

154
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
will deliver us

155
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
out of our

156
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
bondage, or out of

157
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
the hands of

158
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
the Lamanites,

159
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
and we will

160
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
be their

161
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
slaves; for it is

162
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
better that we

163
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
be slaves to

164
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
the Nephites

165
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
than to pay

166
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:57,
tribute to the king of the Lamanites.

167
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
16 And now,

168
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
king Limhi

169
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
commanded his

170
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
guards that

171
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
they should no

172
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
more bind

173
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
Ammon nor his

174
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
brethren, but

175
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
caused that

176
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
they should go

177
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
to the hill

178
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
which was north

179
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
of Shilom,

180
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
and bring

181
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
their brethren

182
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
into the city,

183
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
that thereby

184
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
they might

185
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
eat, and drink,

186
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
and rest

187
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
themselves from

188
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
the labors of

189
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
their

190
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
journey; for they

191
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
had suffered

192
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
many things;

193
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
they had

194
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:43,
suffered hunger, thirst, and fatigue.

195
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
17 And now,

196
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
it came to

197
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
pass on the

198
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
morrow that

199
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
king Limhi

200
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
sent a

201
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
proclamation among

202
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
all his

203
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
people, that

204
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
thereby they

205
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
might gather

206
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
themselves

207
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
together to

208
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
the temple, to

209
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
hear the

210
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
words which he

211
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:57,
should speak unto them.

212
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
18 And it

213
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
came to pass

214
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
that when

215
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
they had

216
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
gathered

217
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
themselves together

218
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
that he spake

219
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
unto them

220
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
in this wise,

221
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
saying: O

222
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
ye, my

223
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
people, lift up

224
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
your heads and

225
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
be

226
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
comforted; for

227
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
behold, the time

228
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
is at hand,

229
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
or is not

230
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
far distant,

231
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
when we shall

232
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
no longer

233
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
be in

234
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
subjection to our

235
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
enemies,

236
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
notwithstanding

237
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
our many

238
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
strugglings,

239
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
which have

240
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
been in vain;

241
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
yet I trust

242
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
there

243
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
remaineth an

244
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
effectual struggle

245
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:43,
to be made.

246
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
19

247
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
Therefore, lift up

248
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
your heads,

249
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
and

250
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
rejoice, and put

251
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
your trust

252
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
in God, in

253
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
that God

254
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
who was the

255
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
God of

256
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
Abraham, and

257
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
Isaac, and

258
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
Jacob; and

259
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
also, that God

260
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
who

261
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
brought the

262
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
children of

263
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
Israel out of

264
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
the land of

265
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
Egypt, and

266
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
caused that

267
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
they

268
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
should walk

269
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
through the Red

270
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
Sea on dry

271
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
ground,

272
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
and fed them

273
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
with manna

274
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
that they

275
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
might not

276
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
perish in the

277
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0


278
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:57,
wilderness; and many more things did he do for them.

279
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
20 And

280
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
again, that

281
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
same God

282
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
has brought

283
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
our

284
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
fathers out of

285
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
the land of

286
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0


287
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
Jerusalem, and has

288
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
kept and

289
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
preserved

290
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
his people

291
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
even until

292
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
now; and

293
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
behold, it

294
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
is

295
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
because of our

296
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
iniquities

297
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
and

298
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
abominations

299
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:57,0
that he has

300
00:11:57,0 --> 00:11:43,
brought us into bondage.

301
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
21 And ye

302
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
all are

00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
this

305
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
day, that

306
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
Zeniff, who

307
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
was made

308
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0

311
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
