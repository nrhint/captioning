00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:03,857
Chapter 7 Ammon finds the land of Lehi-Nephi,

2
00:00:03,857 --> 00:00:07,714
where Limhi is king—Limhi’s people are in bondage to

3
00:00:07,714 --> 00:00:11,571
the Lamanites—Limhi recounts their history—A

4
00:00:11,571 --> 00:00:15,428
prophet (Abinadi) had testified that Christ is the

5
00:00:15,428 --> 00:00:19,285
God and Father of all things—Those who sow

6
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:23,142
filthiness reap the whirlwind, and those who put their

7
00:00:23,142 --> 00:00:27,861
trust in the Lord will be delivered. About 121 B.C. 

8
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:28,486
1 And now, it came to pass that after king

9
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:29,111
Mosiah had had continual peace for the space of

10
00:00:29,111 --> 00:00:29,736
three years, he was desirous to know

11
00:00:29,736 --> 00:00:30,361
concerning the people who went up to dwell in the

12
00:00:30,361 --> 00:00:30,986
land of Lehi-Nephi, or in the city of

13
00:00:30,986 --> 00:00:31,611
Lehi-Nephi; for his people had heard nothing from them

14
00:00:31,611 --> 00:00:32,236
from the time they left the land of

15
00:00:32,236 --> 00:00:32,266
Zarahemla; therefore, they wearied him with their teasings.

16
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:41,516
2 And it came to pass that king Mosiah

17
00:00:41,516 --> 00:00:50,766
granted that sixteen of their strong

18
00:00:50,766 --> 00:01:00,016
men might go up to the land of

19
00:01:00,016 --> 00:01:09,069
Lehi-Nephi, to inquire concerning their brethren.

20
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,469
3 And it came to pass that on the

21
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:11,869
morrow they started to go up, having

22
00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:13,269
with them one Ammon, he being a strong

23
00:01:13,269 --> 00:01:14,669
and mighty man, and a descendant of

24
00:01:14,669 --> 00:01:16,109
Zarahemla; and he was also their leader.

25
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,609
4 And now, they knew not the

26
00:01:18,609 --> 00:01:21,109
course they should travel in the

27
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:23,609
wilderness to go up to the land of

28
00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:26,109
Lehi-Nephi; therefore they

29
00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:28,609
wandered many days in the

30
00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:31,124
wilderness, even forty days did they wander.

31
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:33,524
5 And when they had

32
00:01:33,524 --> 00:01:35,924
wandered forty days they came to

33
00:01:35,924 --> 00:01:38,324
a hill, which is north of

34
00:01:38,324 --> 00:01:40,724
the land of Shilom, and

35
00:01:40,724 --> 00:01:43,503
there they pitched their tents.

36
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:43,703
6 And Ammon took three of

37
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:43,903
his brethren, and their

38
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:44,103
names were Amaleki,

39
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:44,303
Helem, and Hem, and they went

40
00:01:44,303 --> 00:01:44,972
down into the land of Nephi.

41
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:46,639
7 And behold, they met

42
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:48,306
the king of the people

43
00:01:48,306 --> 00:01:49,973
who were in the land of

44
00:01:49,973 --> 00:01:51,64
Nephi, and in the land

45
00:01:51,64 --> 00:01:53,307
of Shilom; and they

46
00:01:53,307 --> 00:01:54,974
were surrounded by the

47
00:01:54,974 --> 00:01:56,641
king’s guard, and were

48
00:01:56,641 --> 00:01:58,308
taken, and were bound,

49
00:01:58,308 --> 00:01:59,252
and were committed to prison.

50
00:01:59,252 --> 00:01:59,169
8 And it came to pass

51
00:01:59,169 --> 00:01:59,086
when they had been in

52
00:01:59,086 --> 00:01:59,003
prison two days they

53
00:01:59,003 --> 00:01:58,92
were again brought

54
00:01:58,92 --> 00:01:58,837
before the king, and their

55
00:01:58,837 --> 00:01:58,754
bands were loosed;

56
00:01:58,754 --> 00:01:58,671
and they stood before

57
00:01:58,671 --> 00:01:58,588
the king, and were

58
00:01:58,588 --> 00:01:58,505
permitted, or rather

59
00:01:58,505 --> 00:01:58,422
commanded, that they should

60
00:01:58,422 --> 00:01:58,339
answer the questions

61
00:01:58,339 --> 00:01:58,318
which he should ask them.

62
00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:58,227
9 And he said unto

63
00:01:58,227 --> 00:01:58,136
them: Behold, I am

64
00:01:58,136 --> 00:01:58,045
Limhi, the son of Noah,

65
00:01:58,045 --> 00:01:57,954
who was the son of

66
00:01:57,954 --> 00:01:57,863
Zeniff, who came up out

67
00:01:57,863 --> 00:01:57,772
of the land of

68
00:01:57,772 --> 00:01:57,681
Zarahemla to inherit this

69
00:01:57,681 --> 00:01:57,59
land, which was the

70
00:01:57,59 --> 00:01:57,499
land of their fathers,

71
00:01:57,499 --> 00:01:57,408
who was made a king

72
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:57,384
by the voice of the people.

73
00:01:57,384 --> 00:01:57,259
10 And now, I

74
00:01:57,259 --> 00:01:57,134
desire to know the cause

75
00:01:57,134 --> 00:01:57,009
whereby ye were so

76
00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:56,884
bold as to come

77
00:01:56,884 --> 00:01:56,759
near the walls of the

78
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:56,634
city, when I,

79
00:01:56,634 --> 00:01:56,509
myself, was with my

80
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:56,45
guards without the gate?

81
00:01:56,45 --> 00:01:56,632
11 And now, for

82
00:01:56,632 --> 00:01:56,814
this cause have I

83
00:01:56,814 --> 00:01:56,996
suffered that ye

84
00:01:56,996 --> 00:01:57,178
should be preserved,

85
00:01:57,178 --> 00:01:57,36
that I might

86
00:01:57,36 --> 00:01:57,542
inquire of you, or else

87
00:01:57,542 --> 00:01:57,724
I should have

88
00:01:57,724 --> 00:01:57,906
caused that my guards

89
00:01:57,906 --> 00:01:58,088
should have put

90
00:01:58,088 --> 00:01:58,27
you to death. Ye

91
00:01:58,27 --> 00:01:58,385
are permitted to speak.

92
00:01:58,385 --> 00:01:58,323
12 And now, when

93
00:01:58,323 --> 00:01:58,261
Ammon saw that he

94
00:01:58,261 --> 00:01:58,199
was permitted to

95
00:01:58,199 --> 00:01:58,137
speak, he went

96
00:01:58,137 --> 00:01:58,075
forth and bowed

97
00:01:58,075 --> 00:01:58,013
himself before the

98
00:01:58,013 --> 00:01:57,951
king; and rising

99
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:57,889
again he said: O

100
00:01:57,889 --> 00:01:57,827
king, I am very

101
00:01:57,827 --> 00:01:57,765
thankful before

102
00:01:57,765 --> 00:01:57,703
God this day that I

103
00:01:57,703 --> 00:01:57,641
am yet alive,

104
00:01:57,641 --> 00:01:57,579
and am permitted to

105
00:01:57,579 --> 00:01:57,517
speak; and I

106
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:57,455
will endeavor to

107
00:01:57,455 --> 00:01:57,451
speak with boldness;

108
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:57,392
13 For I am

109
00:01:57,392 --> 00:01:57,333
assured that if ye

110
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:57,274
had known me ye

111
00:01:57,274 --> 00:01:57,215
would not have

112
00:01:57,215 --> 00:01:57,156
suffered that I

113
00:01:57,156 --> 00:01:57,097
should have worn

114
00:01:57,097 --> 00:01:57,038
these bands. For

115
00:01:57,038 --> 00:01:56,979
I am Ammon, and

116
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:56,92
am a descendant

117
00:01:56,92 --> 00:01:56,861
of Zarahemla,

118
00:01:56,861 --> 00:01:56,802
and have come up

119
00:01:56,802 --> 00:01:56,743
out of the land

120
00:01:56,743 --> 00:01:56,684
of Zarahemla to

121
00:01:56,684 --> 00:01:56,625
inquire

122
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:56,566
concerning our brethren,

123
00:01:56,566 --> 00:01:56,507
whom Zeniff

124
00:01:56,507 --> 00:01:56,516
brought up out of that land.

125
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:56,621
14 And now, it

126
00:01:56,621 --> 00:01:56,726
came to pass

127
00:01:56,726 --> 00:01:56,831
that after Limhi

128
00:01:56,831 --> 00:01:56,936
had heard the

129
00:01:56,936 --> 00:01:57,041
words of Ammon,

130
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:57,146
he was

131
00:01:57,146 --> 00:01:57,251
exceedingly glad, and

132
00:01:57,251 --> 00:01:57,356
said: Now, I

133
00:01:57,356 --> 00:01:57,461
know of a surety

134
00:01:57,461 --> 00:01:57,566
that my brethren

135
00:01:57,566 --> 00:01:57,671
who were in

136
00:01:57,671 --> 00:01:57,776
the land of

137
00:01:57,776 --> 00:01:57,881
Zarahemla are yet

138
00:01:57,881 --> 00:01:57,986
alive. And now, I

139
00:01:57,986 --> 00:01:58,091
will rejoice;

140
00:01:58,091 --> 00:01:58,196
and on the

141
00:01:58,196 --> 00:01:58,301
morrow I will cause

142
00:01:58,301 --> 00:01:58,406
that my people

143
00:01:58,406 --> 00:01:58,919
shall rejoice also.

144
00:01:58,919 --> 00:01:59,789
15 For behold,

145
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:00,659
we are in

146
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:01,529
bondage to the

147
00:02:01,529 --> 00:02:02,399
Lamanites, and

148
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,269
are taxed with

149
00:02:03,269 --> 00:02:04,139
a tax which is

150
00:02:04,139 --> 00:02:05,009
grievous to

151
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:05,879
be borne. And

152
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:06,749
now, behold,

153
00:02:06,749 --> 00:02:07,619
our brethren

154
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:08,489
will deliver us

155
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:09,359
out of our

156
00:02:09,359 --> 00:02:10,229
bondage, or out of

157
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:11,099
the hands of

158
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:11,969
the Lamanites,

159
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:12,839
and we will

160
00:02:12,839 --> 00:02:13,709
be their

161
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:14,579
slaves; for it is

162
00:02:14,579 --> 00:02:15,449
better that we

163
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:16,319
be slaves to

164
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,189
the Nephites

165
00:02:17,189 --> 00:02:18,059
than to pay

166
00:02:18,059 --> 00:02:18,805
tribute to the king of the Lamanites.

167
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:19,198
16 And now,

168
00:02:19,198 --> 00:02:19,591
king Limhi

169
00:02:19,591 --> 00:02:19,984
commanded his

170
00:02:19,984 --> 00:02:20,377
guards that

171
00:02:20,377 --> 00:02:20,77
they should no

172
00:02:20,77 --> 00:02:21,163
more bind

173
00:02:21,163 --> 00:02:21,556
Ammon nor his

174
00:02:21,556 --> 00:02:21,949
brethren, but

175
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:22,342
caused that

176
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:22,735
they should go

177
00:02:22,735 --> 00:02:23,128
to the hill

178
00:02:23,128 --> 00:02:23,521
which was north

179
00:02:23,521 --> 00:02:23,914
of Shilom,

180
00:02:23,914 --> 00:02:24,307
and bring

181
00:02:24,307 --> 00:02:24,7
their brethren

182
00:02:24,7 --> 00:02:25,093
into the city,

183
00:02:25,093 --> 00:02:25,486
that thereby

184
00:02:25,486 --> 00:02:25,879
they might

185
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:26,272
eat, and drink,

186
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:26,665
and rest

187
00:02:26,665 --> 00:02:27,058
themselves from

188
00:02:27,058 --> 00:02:27,451
the labors of

189
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:27,844
their

190
00:02:27,844 --> 00:02:28,237
journey; for they

191
00:02:28,237 --> 00:02:28,63
had suffered

192
00:02:28,63 --> 00:02:29,023
many things;

193
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:29,416
they had

194
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:29,149
suffered hunger, thirst, and fatigue.

195
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:29,09
17 And now,

196
00:02:29,09 --> 00:02:29,031
it came to

197
00:02:29,031 --> 00:02:28,972
pass on the

198
00:02:28,972 --> 00:02:28,913
morrow that

199
00:02:28,913 --> 00:02:28,854
king Limhi

200
00:02:28,854 --> 00:02:28,795
sent a

201
00:02:28,795 --> 00:02:28,736
proclamation among

202
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:28,677
all his

203
00:02:28,677 --> 00:02:28,618
people, that

204
00:02:28,618 --> 00:02:28,559
thereby they

205
00:02:28,559 --> 00:02:28,5
might gather

206
00:02:28,5 --> 00:02:28,441
themselves

207
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:28,382
together to

208
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:28,323
the temple, to

209
00:02:28,323 --> 00:02:28,264
hear the

210
00:02:28,264 --> 00:02:28,205
words which he

211
00:02:28,205 --> 00:02:28,215
should speak unto them.

212
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:28,362
18 And it

213
00:02:28,362 --> 00:02:28,509
came to pass

214
00:02:28,509 --> 00:02:28,656
that when

215
00:02:28,656 --> 00:02:28,803
they had

216
00:02:28,803 --> 00:02:28,95
gathered

217
00:02:28,95 --> 00:02:29,097
themselves together

218
00:02:29,097 --> 00:02:29,244
that he spake

219
00:02:29,244 --> 00:02:29,391
unto them

220
00:02:29,391 --> 00:02:29,538
in this wise,

221
00:02:29,538 --> 00:02:29,685
saying: O

222
00:02:29,685 --> 00:02:29,832
ye, my

223
00:02:29,832 --> 00:02:29,979
people, lift up

224
00:02:29,979 --> 00:02:30,126
your heads and

225
00:02:30,126 --> 00:02:30,273
be

226
00:02:30,273 --> 00:02:30,42
comforted; for

227
00:02:30,42 --> 00:02:30,567
behold, the time

228
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:30,714
is at hand,

229
00:02:30,714 --> 00:02:30,861
or is not

230
00:02:30,861 --> 00:02:31,008
far distant,

231
00:02:31,008 --> 00:02:31,155
when we shall

232
00:02:31,155 --> 00:02:31,302
no longer

233
00:02:31,302 --> 00:02:31,449
be in

234
00:02:31,449 --> 00:02:31,596
subjection to our

235
00:02:31,596 --> 00:02:31,743
enemies,

236
00:02:31,743 --> 00:02:31,89
notwithstanding

237
00:02:31,89 --> 00:02:32,037
our many

238
00:02:32,037 --> 00:02:32,184
strugglings,

239
00:02:32,184 --> 00:02:32,331
which have

240
00:02:32,331 --> 00:02:32,478
been in vain;

241
00:02:32,478 --> 00:02:32,625
yet I trust

242
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:32,772
there

243
00:02:32,772 --> 00:02:32,919
remaineth an

244
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:33,066
effectual struggle

245
00:02:33,066 --> 00:02:33,62
to be made.

246
00:02:33,62 --> 00:02:33,862
19

247
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:34,104
Therefore, lift up

248
00:02:34,104 --> 00:02:34,346
your heads,

249
00:02:34,346 --> 00:02:34,588
and

250
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:34,83
rejoice, and put

251
00:02:34,83 --> 00:02:35,072
your trust

252
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:35,314
in God, in

253
00:02:35,314 --> 00:02:35,556
that God

254
00:02:35,556 --> 00:02:35,798
who was the

255
00:02:35,798 --> 00:02:36,04
God of

256
00:02:36,04 --> 00:02:36,282
Abraham, and

257
00:02:36,282 --> 00:02:36,524
Isaac, and

258
00:02:36,524 --> 00:02:36,766
Jacob; and

259
00:02:36,766 --> 00:02:37,008
also, that God

260
00:02:37,008 --> 00:02:37,25
who

261
00:02:37,25 --> 00:02:37,492
brought the

262
00:02:37,492 --> 00:02:37,734
children of

263
00:02:37,734 --> 00:02:37,976
Israel out of

264
00:02:37,976 --> 00:02:38,218
the land of

265
00:02:38,218 --> 00:02:38,46
Egypt, and

266
00:02:38,46 --> 00:02:38,702
caused that

267
00:02:38,702 --> 00:02:38,944
they

268
00:02:38,944 --> 00:02:39,186
should walk

269
00:02:39,186 --> 00:02:39,428
through the Red

270
00:02:39,428 --> 00:02:39,67
Sea on dry

271
00:02:39,67 --> 00:02:39,912
ground,

272
00:02:39,912 --> 00:02:40,154
and fed them

273
00:02:40,154 --> 00:02:40,396
with manna

274
00:02:40,396 --> 00:02:40,638
that they

275
00:02:40,638 --> 00:02:40,88
might not

276
00:02:40,88 --> 00:02:41,122
perish in the

277
00:02:41,122 --> 00:02:41,364


278
00:02:41,364 --> 00:02:41,561
wilderness; and many more things did he do for them.

279
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:41,697
20 And

280
00:02:41,697 --> 00:02:41,833
again, that

281
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:41,969
same God

282
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:42,105
has brought

283
00:02:42,105 --> 00:02:42,241
our

284
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:42,377
fathers out of

285
00:02:42,377 --> 00:02:42,513
the land of

286
00:02:42,513 --> 00:02:42,649


287
00:02:42,649 --> 00:02:42,785
Jerusalem, and has

288
00:02:42,785 --> 00:02:42,921
kept and

289
00:02:42,921 --> 00:02:43,057
preserved

290
00:02:43,057 --> 00:02:43,193

291
00:02:43,193 --> 00:02:43,329
even until

292
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:43,465
now; and

293
00:02:43,465 --> 00:02:43,601
behold, it

294
00:02:43,601 --> 00:02:43,737
is

295
00:02:43,737 --> 00:02:43,873
because of our

296
00:02:43,873 --> 00:02:44,009
iniquities

297
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:44,145
and

298
00:02:44,145 --> 00:02:44,281

299
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:44,417

300
00:02:44,417 --> 00:02:44,564
brought us into bondage.

301
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:44,797
