00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:11,857
Chapter 7 Ammon finds the land of Lehi-Nephi,

2
00:00:11,857 --> 00:00:23,714
 where Limhi is king—Limhi’s people are in bondage to

3
00:00:23,714 --> 00:00:35,571
 the Lamanites—Limhi recounts their history—A

4
00:00:35,571 --> 00:00:47,428
 prophet (Abinadi) had testified that Christ is the God

5
00:00:47,428 --> 00:00:59,285
 and Father of all things—Those who sow filthiness

6
00:00:59,285 --> 00:01:11,142
 reap the whirlwind, and those who put their trust

7
00:01:11,142 --> 00:01:22,999
 in the Lord will be delivered. About 121 B.C.

8
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:28,942
1 And now, it came to pass that after king Mosiah

9
00:01:28,942 --> 00:01:34,067
 had had continual peace for the space of three

10
00:01:34,067 --> 00:01:39,192
 years, he was desirous to know concerning the people

11
00:01:39,192 --> 00:01:44,317
 who went up to dwell in the land of Lehi-Nephi, or

12
00:01:44,317 --> 00:01:49,442
 in the city of Lehi-Nephi; for his people had

13
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:54,567
 heard nothing from them from the time they left the

14
00:01:54,567 --> 00:01:59,692
 land of Zarahemla; therefore, they wearied him with

15
00:01:59,692 --> 00:02:04,817
 their teasings

16
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:11,558
2 And it came to pass that king Mosiah granted

17
00:02:11,558 --> 00:02:18,558
 that sixteen of their strong men might go up to the

18
00:02:18,558 --> 00:02:25,558
 land of Lehi-Nephi, to inquire concerning their

19
00:02:25,558 --> 00:02:32,558
 brethren

20
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:36,886
3 And it came to pass that on the morrow they

21
00:02:36,886 --> 00:02:40,886
 started to go up, having with them one Ammon, he being

22
00:02:40,886 --> 00:02:44,886
 a strong and mighty man, and a descendant of

23
00:02:44,886 --> 00:02:48,886
 Zarahemla; and he was also their leader

24
00:02:48,835 --> 00:03:06,835
4 And now, they knew not the course they should

25
00:03:06,835 --> 00:03:24,835
 travel in the wilderness to go up to the land of

26
00:03:24,835 --> 00:03:42,835
 Lehi-Nephi; therefore they wandered many days in the

27
00:03:42,835 --> 00:04:00,835
 wilderness, even forty days did they wander

28
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:11,274
5 And when they had wandered forty days they came

29
00:04:11,274 --> 00:04:21,941
 to a hill, which is north of the land of Shilom,

30
00:04:21,941 --> 00:04:32,608
 and there they pitched their tents

31
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:35,173
6 And Ammon took three of his brethren, and their

32
00:04:35,173 --> 00:04:37,84
 names were Amaleki, Helem, and Hem, and they went

33
00:04:37,84 --> 00:04:40,507
 down into the land of Nephi

34
00:04:40,48 --> 00:04:50,08
7 And behold, they met the king of the people who

35
00:04:50,08 --> 00:04:59,68
 were in the land of Nephi, and in the land of

36
00:04:59,68 --> 00:05:09,28
 Shilom; and they were surrounded by the king’s guard,

37
00:05:09,28 --> 00:05:18,88
 and were taken, and were bound, and were committed

38
00:05:18,88 --> 00:05:28,48
 to prison

39
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:32,328
8 And it came to pass when they had been in prison

40
00:05:32,328 --> 00:05:36,328
 two days they were again brought before the king,

41
00:05:36,328 --> 00:05:40,328
 and their bands were loosed; and they stood

42
00:05:40,328 --> 00:05:44,328
 before the king, and were permitted, or rather

43
00:05:44,328 --> 00:05:48,328
 commanded, that they should answer the questions which he

44
00:05:48,328 --> 00:05:52,328
 should ask them

45
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:53,852
9 And he said unto them: Behold, I am Limhi, the

46
00:05:53,852 --> 00:05:55,452
 son of Noah, who was the son of Zeniff, who came up

47
00:05:55,452 --> 00:05:57,052
 out of the land of Zarahemla to inherit this

48
00:05:57,052 --> 00:05:58,652
 land, which was the land of their fathers, who was

49
00:05:58,652 --> 00:06:00,252
 made a king by the voice of the people

50
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:00,477
10 And now, I desire to know the cause whereby ye

51
00:06:00,477 --> 00:06:00,727
 were so bold as to come near the walls of the

52
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:00,977
 city, when I, myself, was with my guards without the

53
00:06:00,977 --> 00:06:01,227
 gate

54
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:01,928
11 And now, for this cause have I suffered that ye

55
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:02,528
 should be preserved, that I might inquire of you,

56
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,128
 or else I should have caused that my guards

57
00:06:03,128 --> 00:06:03,728
 should have put you to death. Ye are permitted to

58
00:06:03,728 --> 00:06:04,328
 speak

59
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:10,664
12 And now, when Ammon saw that he was permitted

60
00:06:10,664 --> 00:06:16,497
 to speak, he went forth and bowed himself before

61
00:06:16,497 --> 00:06:22,33
 the king; and rising again he said: O king, I am

62
00:06:22,33 --> 00:06:28,163
 very thankful before God this day that I am yet

63
00:06:28,163 --> 00:06:33,996
 alive, and am permitted to speak; and I will endeavor

64
00:06:33,996 --> 00:06:39,829
 to speak with boldness

65
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:45,933
13 For I am assured that if ye had known me ye

66
00:06:45,933 --> 00:06:52,1
 would not have suffered that I should have worn these

67
00:06:52,1 --> 00:06:58,267
 bands. For I am Ammon, and am a descendant of

68
00:06:58,267 --> 00:07:04,434
 Zarahemla, and have come up out of the land of

69
00:07:04,434 --> 00:07:10,601
 Zarahemla to inquire concerning our brethren, whom

70
00:07:10,601 --> 00:07:16,768
 Zeniff brought up out of that land

71
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:23,003
14 And now, it came to pass that after Limhi had

72
00:07:23,003 --> 00:07:29,503
 heard the words of Ammon, he was exceedingly glad,

73
00:07:29,503 --> 00:07:36,003
 and said: Now, I know of a surety that my brethren

74
00:07:36,003 --> 00:07:42,503
 who were in the land of Zarahemla are yet alive.

75
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:49,003
 And now, I will rejoice; and on the morrow I will

76
00:07:49,003 --> 00:07:55,503
 cause that my people shall rejoice also

77
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:59,138
15 For behold, we are in bondage to the Lamanites,

78
00:07:59,138 --> 00:08:02,567
 and are taxed with a tax which is grievous to be

79
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:05,996
 borne. And now, behold, our brethren will deliver

80
00:08:05,996 --> 00:08:09,425
 us out of our bondage, or out of the hands of the

81
00:08:09,425 --> 00:08:12,854
 Lamanites, and we will be their slaves; for it is

82
00:08:12,854 --> 00:08:16,283
 better that we be slaves to the Nephites than to

83
00:08:16,283 --> 00:08:19,712
 pay tribute to the king of the Lamanites

84
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:28,757
16 And now, king Limhi commanded his guards that

85
00:08:28,757 --> 00:08:37,882
 they should no more bind Ammon nor his brethren,

86
00:08:37,882 --> 00:08:47,007
 but caused that they should go to the hill which was

87
00:08:47,007 --> 00:08:56,132
 north of Shilom, and bring their brethren into

88
00:08:56,132 --> 00:09:05,257
 the city, that thereby they might eat, and drink,

89
00:09:05,257 --> 00:09:14,382
 and rest themselves from the labors of their

90
00:09:14,382 --> 00:09:23,507
 journey; for they had suffered many things; they had

91
00:09:23,507 --> 00:09:32,632
 suffered hunger, thirst, and fatigue

92
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:37,005
17 And now, it came to pass on the morrow that

93
00:09:37,005 --> 00:09:41,805
 king Limhi sent a proclamation among all his people,

94
00:09:41,805 --> 00:09:46,605
 that thereby they might gather themselves together

95
00:09:46,605 --> 00:09:51,405
 to the temple, to hear the words which he should

96
00:09:51,405 --> 00:09:56,205
 speak unto them

97
00:09:56,296 --> 00:10:01,74
18 And it came to pass that when they had gathered

98
00:10:01,74 --> 00:10:07,184
 themselves together that he spake unto them in

99
00:10:07,184 --> 00:10:12,628
 this wise, saying: O ye, my people, lift up your

100
00:10:12,628 --> 00:10:18,072
 heads and be comforted; for behold, the time is at

101
00:10:18,072 --> 00:10:23,516
 hand, or is not far distant, when we shall no longer

102
00:10:23,516 --> 00:10:28,96
 be in subjection to our enemies, notwithstanding

103
00:10:28,96 --> 00:10:34,404
 our many strugglings, which have been in vain; yet

104
00:10:34,404 --> 00:10:39,848
 I trust there remaineth an effectual struggle to

105
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:45,292
 be made

106
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:52,995
19 Therefore, lift up your heads, and rejoice, and

107
00:10:52,995 --> 00:11:00,245
 put your trust in God, in that God who was the

108
00:11:00,245 --> 00:11:07,495
 God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob; and also, that

109
00:11:07,495 --> 00:11:14,745
 God who brought the children of Israel out of the

110
00:11:14,745 --> 00:11:21,995
 land of Egypt, and caused that they should walk

111
00:11:21,995 --> 00:11:29,245
 through the Red Sea on dry ground, and fed them

112
00:11:29,245 --> 00:11:36,495
 with manna that they might not perish in the

113
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:43,745
 wilderness; and many more things did he do for them

114
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:49,403
20 And again, that same God has brought our

115
00:11:49,403 --> 00:11:55,203
 fathers out of the land of Jerusalem, and has kept and

116
00:11:55,203 --> 00:12:01,003
 preserved his people even until now; and behold, it

117
00:12:01,003 --> 00:12:06,803
 is because of our iniquities and abominations

118
00:12:06,803 --> 00:12:12,603
 that he has brought us into bondage

119
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:19,143
21 And ye all are witnesses this day, that Zeniff,

120
00:12:19,143 --> 00:12:25,587
 who was made king over this people, he being

121
00:12:25,587 --> 00:12:32,031
 over-zealous to inherit the land of his fathers,

122
00:12:32,031 --> 00:12:38,475
 therefore being deceived by the cunning and craftiness

123
00:12:38,475 --> 00:12:44,919
 of king Laman, who having entered into a treaty

124
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:51,363
 with king Zeniff, and having yielded up into his

125
00:12:51,363 --> 00:12:57,807
 hands the possessions of a part of the land, or even

126
00:12:57,807 --> 00:13:04,251
 the city of Lehi-Nephi, and the city of Shilom;

127
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:10,695
 and the land round about

128
00:13:10,69 --> 00:13:17,468
22 And all this he did, for the sole purpose of

129
00:13:17,468 --> 00:13:24,246
 bringing this people into subjection or into

130
00:13:24,246 --> 00:13:31,024
 bondage. And behold, we at this time do pay tribute to

131
00:13:31,024 --> 00:13:37,802
 the king of the Lamanites, to the amount of one half

132
00:13:37,802 --> 00:13:44,58
 of our corn, and our barley, and even all our

133
00:13:44,58 --> 00:13:51,358
 grain of every kind, and one half of the increase of

134
00:13:51,358 --> 00:13:58,136
 our flocks and our herds; and even one half of all

135
00:13:58,136 --> 00:14:04,914
 we have or possess the king of the Lamanites doth

136
00:14:04,914 --> 00:14:11,692
 exact of us, or our lives

137
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:18,818
23 And now, is not this grievous to be borne? And

138
00:14:18,818 --> 00:14:25,818
 is not this, our affliction, great? Now behold,

139
00:14:25,818 --> 00:14:32,818
 how great reason we have to mourn

140
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:39,622
24 Yea, I say unto you, great are the reasons

141
00:14:39,622 --> 00:14:46,872
 which we have to mourn; for behold how many of our

142
00:14:46,872 --> 00:14:54,122
 brethren have been slain, and their blood has been

143
00:14:54,122 --> 00:15:01,372
 spilt in vain, and all because of iniquity

144
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:07,034
25 For if this people had not fallen into

145
00:15:07,034 --> 00:15:12,367
 transgression the Lord would not have suffered that this

146
00:15:12,367 --> 00:15:17,7
 great evil should come upon them. But behold, they

147
00:15:17,7 --> 00:15:23,033
 would not hearken unto his words; but there arose

148
00:15:23,033 --> 00:15:28,366
 contentions among them, even so much that they did

149
00:15:28,366 --> 00:15:33,699
 shed blood among themselves

150
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:39,399
26 And a prophet of the Lord have they slain; yea,

151
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:45,399
 a chosen man of God, who told them of their

152
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:51,399
 wickedness and abominations, and prophesied of many

153
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:57,399
 things which are to come, yea, even the coming of

154
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:03,399
 Christ

155
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:09,351
27 And because he said unto them that Christ was

156
00:16:09,351 --> 00:16:15,573
 the God, the Father of all things, and said that he

157
00:16:15,573 --> 00:16:21,795
 should take upon him the image of man, and it

158
00:16:21,795 --> 00:16:28,017
 should be the image after which man was created in

159
00:16:28,017 --> 00:16:34,239
 the beginning; or in other words, he said that man

160
00:16:34,239 --> 00:16:40,461
 was created after the image of God, and that God

161
00:16:40,461 --> 00:16:46,683
 should come down among the children of men, and take

162
00:16:46,683 --> 00:16:52,905
 upon him flesh and blood, and go forth upon the

163
00:16:52,905 --> 00:16:59,127
 face of the earth

164
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:06,019
28 And now, because he said this, they did put him

165
00:17:06,019 --> 00:17:12,419
 to death; and many more things did they do which

166
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:18,819
 brought down the wrath of God upon them.

167
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:25,219
 Therefore, who wondereth that they are in bondage, and that

168
00:17:25,219 --> 00:17:31,619
 they are smitten with sore afflictions

169
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:38,551
29 For behold, the Lord hath said: I will not

170
00:17:38,551 --> 00:17:45,551
 succor my people in the day of their transgression;

171
00:17:45,551 --> 00:17:52,551
 but I will hedge up their ways that they prosper

172
00:17:52,551 --> 00:17:59,551
 not; and their doings shall be as a stumbling block

173
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:06,551
 before them

174
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:12,785
30 And again, he saith: If my people shall sow

175
00:18:12,785 --> 00:18:19,452
 filthiness they shall reap the chaff thereof in the

176
00:18:19,452 --> 00:18:26,119
 whirlwind; and the effect thereof is poison

177
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:39,072
31 And again he saith: If my people shall sow

178
00:18:39,072 --> 00:18:52,072
 filthiness they shall reap the east wind, which

179
00:18:52,072 --> 00:19:05,072
 bringeth immediate destruction

180
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:06,445
32 And now, behold, the promise of the Lord is

181
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:06,945
 fulfilled, and ye are smitten and afflicted

182
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:07,379
33 But if ye will turn to the Lord with full

183
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:08,379
 purpose of heart, and put your trust in him, and serve

184
00:19:08,379 --> 00:19:09,379
 him with all diligence of mind, if ye do this, he

185
00:19:09,379 --> 00:19:10,379
 will, according to his own will and pleasure,

186
00:19:10,379 --> 00:19:11,379
 deliver you out of bondage.
