00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 8 Ammon teaches the people of

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Limhi—He learns of the twenty-four Jaredite

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
plates—Ancient records can be translated by seers—No

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:04:29,
gift is greater than seership. About 121 B.C. 

5
00:04:29,0 --> 00:04:29,0
1 And it came to pass that after king Limhi

6
00:04:29,0 --> 00:04:29,0
had made an end of speaking to his people,

7
00:04:29,0 --> 00:04:29,0
for he spake many things unto them and only a

8
00:04:29,0 --> 00:04:29,0
few of them have I written in this book, he

9
00:04:29,0 --> 00:04:29,0
told his people all the things concerning

10
00:04:29,0 --> 00:12:26,
their brethren who were in the land of Zarahemla.

11
00:12:26,0 --> 00:12:26,0
2 And he caused that Ammon should stand

12
00:12:26,0 --> 00:12:26,0
up before the multitude, and rehearse

13
00:12:26,0 --> 00:12:26,0
unto them all that had happened unto their

14
00:12:26,0 --> 00:12:26,0
brethren from the time that Zeniff went

15
00:12:26,0 --> 00:12:26,0
up out of the land even until the time

16
00:12:26,0 --> 00:14:38,
that he himself came up out of the land.

17
00:14:38,0 --> 00:14:38,0
3 And he also rehearsed unto them the

18
00:14:38,0 --> 00:14:38,0
last words which king Benjamin had

19
00:14:38,0 --> 00:14:38,0
taught them, and explained them to the

20
00:14:38,0 --> 00:14:38,0
people of king Limhi, so that they might

21
00:14:38,0 --> 00:24:48,
understand all the words which he spake.

22
00:24:48,0 --> 00:24:48,0
4 And it came to pass that after

23
00:24:48,0 --> 00:24:48,0
he had done all this, that king

24
00:24:48,0 --> 00:24:48,0
Limhi dismissed the multitude,

25
00:24:48,0 --> 00:24:48,0
and caused that they should

26
00:24:48,0 --> 00:24:20,
return every one unto his own house.

27
00:24:20,0 --> 00:24:20,0
5 And it came to pass that

28
00:24:20,0 --> 00:24:20,0
he caused that the plates

29
00:24:20,0 --> 00:24:20,0
which contained the record of

30
00:24:20,0 --> 00:24:20,0
his people from the time that

31
00:24:20,0 --> 00:24:20,0
they left the land of

32
00:24:20,0 --> 00:24:20,0
Zarahemla, should be brought

33
00:24:20,0 --> 00:23:52,
before Ammon, that he might read them.

34
00:23:52,0 --> 00:23:52,0
6 Now, as soon as Ammon

35
00:23:52,0 --> 00:23:52,0
had read the record, the

36
00:23:52,0 --> 00:23:52,0
king inquired of him to

37
00:23:52,0 --> 00:23:52,0
know if he could

38
00:23:52,0 --> 00:23:52,0
interpret languages, and Ammon

39
00:23:52,0 --> 00:23:38,
told him that he could not.

40
00:23:38,0 --> 00:23:38,0
7 And the king said

41
00:23:38,0 --> 00:23:38,0
unto him: Being grieved

42
00:23:38,0 --> 00:23:38,0
for the afflictions of my

43
00:23:38,0 --> 00:23:38,0
people, I caused that

44
00:23:38,0 --> 00:23:38,0
forty and three of my

45
00:23:38,0 --> 00:23:38,0
people should take a

46
00:23:38,0 --> 00:23:38,0
journey into the

47
00:23:38,0 --> 00:23:38,0
wilderness, that thereby they

48
00:23:38,0 --> 00:23:38,0
might find the land of

49
00:23:38,0 --> 00:23:38,0
Zarahemla, that we might

50
00:23:38,0 --> 00:23:38,0
appeal unto our

51
00:23:38,0 --> 00:24:22,
brethren to deliver us out of bondage.

52
00:24:22,0 --> 00:24:22,0
8 And they were lost

53
00:24:22,0 --> 00:24:22,0
in the wilderness for

54
00:24:22,0 --> 00:24:22,0
the space of many days,

55
00:24:22,0 --> 00:24:22,0
yet they were

56
00:24:22,0 --> 00:24:22,0
diligent, and found not the

57
00:24:22,0 --> 00:24:22,0
land of Zarahemla but

58
00:24:22,0 --> 00:24:22,0
returned to this land,

59
00:24:22,0 --> 00:24:22,0
having traveled in a

60
00:24:22,0 --> 00:24:22,0
land among many waters,

61
00:24:22,0 --> 00:24:22,0
having discovered a

62
00:24:22,0 --> 00:24:22,0
land which was covered

63
00:24:22,0 --> 00:24:22,0
with bones of men, and

64
00:24:22,0 --> 00:24:22,0
of beasts, and was

65
00:24:22,0 --> 00:24:22,0
also covered with ruins

66
00:24:22,0 --> 00:24:22,0
of buildings of every

67
00:24:22,0 --> 00:24:22,0
kind, having

68
00:24:22,0 --> 00:24:22,0
discovered a land which had

69
00:24:22,0 --> 00:24:22,0
been peopled with a

70
00:24:22,0 --> 00:24:22,0
people who were as numerous

71
00:24:22,0 --> 00:26:34,
as the hosts of Israel.

72
00:26:34,0 --> 00:26:34,0
9 And for a

73
00:26:34,0 --> 00:26:34,0
testimony that the things

74
00:26:34,0 --> 00:26:34,0
that they had said are

75
00:26:34,0 --> 00:26:34,0
true they have

76
00:26:34,0 --> 00:26:34,0
brought twenty-four

77
00:26:34,0 --> 00:26:34,0
plates which are filled

78
00:26:34,0 --> 00:26:34,0
with engravings, and

79
00:26:34,0 --> 00:29:16,
they are of pure gold.

80
00:29:16,0 --> 00:29:16,0
10 And behold,

81
00:29:16,0 --> 00:29:16,0
also, they have

82
00:29:16,0 --> 00:29:16,0
brought breastplates,

83
00:29:16,0 --> 00:29:16,0
which are large,

84
00:29:16,0 --> 00:29:16,0
and they are of

85
00:29:16,0 --> 00:29:16,0
brass and of copper,

86
00:29:16,0 --> 00:36:24,
and are perfectly sound.

87
00:36:24,0 --> 00:36:24,0
11 And again,

88
00:36:24,0 --> 00:36:24,0
they have brought

89
00:36:24,0 --> 00:36:24,0
swords, the hilts

90
00:36:24,0 --> 00:36:24,0
thereof have

91
00:36:24,0 --> 00:36:24,0
perished, and the

92
00:36:24,0 --> 00:36:24,0
blades thereof were

93
00:36:24,0 --> 00:36:24,0
cankered with

94
00:36:24,0 --> 00:36:24,0
rust; and there is no

95
00:36:24,0 --> 00:36:24,0
one in the land

96
00:36:24,0 --> 00:36:24,0
that is able to

97
00:36:24,0 --> 00:36:24,0
interpret the

98
00:36:24,0 --> 00:36:24,0
language or the

99
00:36:24,0 --> 00:36:24,0
engravings that are on

100
00:36:24,0 --> 00:36:24,0
the plates.

101
00:36:24,0 --> 00:36:24,0
Therefore I said unto

102
00:36:24,0 --> 00:37:54,
thee: Canst thou translate?

103
00:37:54,0 --> 00:37:54,0
12 And I say

104
00:37:54,0 --> 00:37:54,0
unto thee again:

105
00:37:54,0 --> 00:37:54,0
Knowest thou of

106
00:37:54,0 --> 00:37:54,0
any one that can

107
00:37:54,0 --> 00:37:54,0
translate? For I

108
00:37:54,0 --> 00:37:54,0
am desirous that

109
00:37:54,0 --> 00:37:54,0
these records

110
00:37:54,0 --> 00:37:54,0
should be

111
00:37:54,0 --> 00:37:54,0
translated into our

112
00:37:54,0 --> 00:37:54,0
language; for,

113
00:37:54,0 --> 00:37:54,0
perhaps, they will

114
00:37:54,0 --> 00:37:54,0
give us a

115
00:37:54,0 --> 00:37:54,0
knowledge of a remnant

116
00:37:54,0 --> 00:37:54,0
of the people

117
00:37:54,0 --> 00:37:54,0
who have been

118
00:37:54,0 --> 00:37:54,0
destroyed, from

119
00:37:54,0 --> 00:37:54,0
whence these records

120
00:37:54,0 --> 00:37:54,0
came; or,

121
00:37:54,0 --> 00:37:54,0
perhaps, they will

122
00:37:54,0 --> 00:37:54,0
give us a

123
00:37:54,0 --> 00:37:54,0
knowledge of this very

124
00:37:54,0 --> 00:37:54,0
people who have

125
00:37:54,0 --> 00:37:54,0
been destroyed;

126
00:37:54,0 --> 00:37:54,0
and I am desirous

127
00:37:54,0 --> 00:38:24,
to know the cause of their destruction.

128
00:38:24,0 --> 00:38:24,0
13 Now Ammon

129
00:38:24,0 --> 00:38:24,0
said unto him: I

130
00:38:24,0 --> 00:38:24,0
can assuredly

131
00:38:24,0 --> 00:38:24,0
tell thee, O

132
00:38:24,0 --> 00:38:24,0
king, of a man

133
00:38:24,0 --> 00:38:24,0
that can translate

134
00:38:24,0 --> 00:38:24,0
the records;

135
00:38:24,0 --> 00:38:24,0
for he has

136
00:38:24,0 --> 00:38:24,0
wherewith that he

137
00:38:24,0 --> 00:38:24,0
can look, and

138
00:38:24,0 --> 00:38:24,0
translate all

139
00:38:24,0 --> 00:38:24,0
records that are of

140
00:38:24,0 --> 00:38:24,0
ancient date;

141
00:38:24,0 --> 00:38:24,0
and it is a

142
00:38:24,0 --> 00:38:24,0
gift from God. And

143
00:38:24,0 --> 00:38:24,0
the things are

144
00:38:24,0 --> 00:38:24,0
called

145
00:38:24,0 --> 00:38:24,0
interpreters, and no

146
00:38:24,0 --> 00:38:24,0
man can look in

147
00:38:24,0 --> 00:38:24,0
them except he

148
00:38:24,0 --> 00:38:24,0
be commanded,

149
00:38:24,0 --> 00:38:24,0
lest he should

150
00:38:24,0 --> 00:38:24,0
look for that he

151
00:38:24,0 --> 00:38:24,0
ought not and

152
00:38:24,0 --> 00:38:24,0
he should

153
00:38:24,0 --> 00:38:24,0
perish. And

154
00:38:24,0 --> 00:38:24,0
whosoever is commanded

155
00:38:24,0 --> 00:40:36,
to look in them, the same is called seer.

156
00:40:36,0 --> 00:40:36,0
14 And behold,

157
00:40:36,0 --> 00:40:36,0
the king of

158
00:40:36,0 --> 00:40:36,0
the people who

159
00:40:36,0 --> 00:40:36,0
are in the

160
00:40:36,0 --> 00:40:36,0
land of Zarahemla

161
00:40:36,0 --> 00:40:36,0
is the man

162
00:40:36,0 --> 00:40:36,0
that is

163
00:40:36,0 --> 00:40:36,0
commanded to do these

164
00:40:36,0 --> 00:40:36,0
things, and

165
00:40:36,0 --> 00:40:36,0
who has this

166
00:40:36,0 --> 00:40:50,
high gift from God.

167
00:40:50,0 --> 00:40:50,0
15 And the

168
00:40:50,0 --> 00:40:50,0
king said

169
00:40:50,0 --> 00:40:50,0
that a seer

170
00:40:50,0 --> 00:40:50,0
is greater

171
00:40:50,0 --> 00:42:34,
than a prophet.

172
00:42:34,0 --> 00:42:34,0
16 And

173
00:42:34,0 --> 00:42:34,0
Ammon said

174
00:42:34,0 --> 00:42:34,0
that a seer

175
00:42:34,0 --> 00:42:34,0
is a

176
00:42:34,0 --> 00:42:34,0
revelator and a

177
00:42:34,0 --> 00:42:34,0
prophet

178
00:42:34,0 --> 00:42:34,0
also; and a

179
00:42:34,0 --> 00:42:34,0
gift

180
00:42:34,0 --> 00:42:34,0
which is

181
00:42:34,0 --> 00:42:34,0
greater can no

182
00:42:34,0 --> 00:42:34,0
man have,

183
00:42:34,0 --> 00:42:34,0
except he

184
00:42:34,0 --> 00:42:34,0
should

185
00:42:34,0 --> 00:42:34,0
possess the

186
00:42:34,0 --> 00:42:34,0
power of

187
00:42:34,0 --> 00:42:34,0
God, which

188
00:42:34,0 --> 00:42:34,0
no man can;

189
00:42:34,0 --> 00:42:34,0
yet a man

190
00:42:34,0 --> 00:42:34,0
may have

191
00:42:34,0 --> 00:42:34,0
great

192
00:42:34,0 --> 00:49:00,
power given him from God.

193
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
17 But a

194
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
seer can

195
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
know of

196
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
things

197
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
which are

198
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
past, and

199
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
also of

200
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
things

201
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
which are to

202
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
come, and

203
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
by them

204
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
shall all

205
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
things

206
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
be

207
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
revealed, or,

208
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
rather,

209
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
shall secret

210
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
things

211
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
be made

212
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
manifest,

213
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
and hidden

214
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
things

215
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
shall come

216
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
to

217
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
light, and

218
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
things which

219
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
are not

220
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
known

221
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
shall be

222
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
made known

223
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
by them,

224
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
and also

225
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
things

226
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
shall be

227
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
made known

228
00:49:00,0 --> 00:56:30,
by them which otherwise could not be known.

229
00:56:30,0 --> 00:56:30,0
18 Thus

230
00:56:30,0 --> 00:56:30,0
God has

231
00:56:30,0 --> 00:56:30,0
provided

232
00:56:30,0 --> 00:56:30,0
a means

233
00:56:30,0 --> 00:56:30,0
that

234
00:56:30,0 --> 00:56:30,0
man,

235
00:56:30,0 --> 00:56:30,0
through

236
00:56:30,0 --> 00:56:30,0
faith, might

237
00:56:30,0 --> 00:56:30,0
work

238
00:56:30,0 --> 00:56:30,0
mighty

239
00:56:30,0 --> 00:56:30,0
miracles;

240
00:56:30,0 --> 00:56:30,0
therefore

241
00:56:30,0 --> 00:56:30,0
he

242
00:56:30,0 --> 00:56:30,0
becometh a

243
00:56:30,0 --> 00:56:30,0
great

244
00:56:30,0 --> 00:56:30,0
benefit to

245
00:56:30,0 --> 01:08:41,
his fellow beings.

246
01:08:41,0 --> 01:08:41,0
19 And

247
01:08:41,0 --> 01:08:41,0
now, when

248
01:08:41,0 --> 01:08:41,0
Ammon

249
01:08:41,0 --> 01:08:41,0
had made

250
01:08:41,0 --> 01:08:41,0
an end

251
01:08:41,0 --> 01:08:41,0
of

252
01:08:41,0 --> 01:08:41,0

253
01:08:41,0 --> 01:08:41,0
words

254
01:08:41,0 --> 01:08:41,0
the king

255
01:08:41,0 --> 01:08:41,0
rejoiced

256
01:08:41,0 --> 01:08:41,0


257
01:08:41,0 --> 01:08:41,0
exceedingly,

258
01:08:41,0 --> 01:08:41,0
and gave

259
01:08:41,0 --> 01:08:41,0
thanks to

260
01:08:41,0 --> 01:08:41,0
God,

261
01:08:41,0 --> 01:08:41,0
saying:

262
01:08:41,0 --> 01:08:41,0
Doubtless

263
01:08:41,0 --> 01:08:41,0
a great

264
01:08:41,0 --> 01:08:41,0
mystery

265
01:08:41,0 --> 01:08:41,0

271
01:08:41,0 --> 01:08:41,0
interpreters

272
01:08:41,0 --> 01:08:41,0
were

273
01:08:41,0 --> 01:08:41,0
doubtless

274
01:08:41,0 --> 01:08:41,0

275

276
01:08:41,0 --> 01:08:41,0
