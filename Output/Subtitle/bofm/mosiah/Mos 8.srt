00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:06,25
Chapter 8 Ammon teaches the people of

2
00:00:06,25 --> 00:00:12,5
Limhi—He learns of the twenty-four Jaredite

3
00:00:12,5 --> 00:00:18,75
plates—Ancient records can be translated by seers—No

4
00:00:18,75 --> 00:00:25,392
gift is greater than seership. About 121 B.C. 

5
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:27,725
1 And it came to pass that after king Limhi

6
00:00:27,725 --> 00:00:30,058
had made an end of speaking to his people,

7
00:00:30,058 --> 00:00:32,391
for he spake many things unto them and only a

8
00:00:32,391 --> 00:00:34,724
few of them have I written in this book, he

9
00:00:34,724 --> 00:00:37,057
told his people all the things concerning

10
00:00:37,057 --> 00:00:39,206
their brethren who were in the land of Zarahemla.

11
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:41,039
2 And he caused that Ammon should stand

12
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:42,872
up before the multitude, and rehearse

13
00:00:42,872 --> 00:00:44,705
unto them all that had happened unto their

14
00:00:44,705 --> 00:00:46,538
brethren from the time that Zeniff went

15
00:00:46,538 --> 00:00:48,371
up out of the land even until the time

16
00:00:48,371 --> 00:00:50,651
that he himself came up out of the land.

17
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:52,251
3 And he also rehearsed unto them the

18
00:00:52,251 --> 00:00:53,851
last words which king Benjamin had

19
00:00:53,851 --> 00:00:55,451
taught them, and explained them to the

20
00:00:55,451 --> 00:00:57,051
people of king Limhi, so that they might

21
00:00:57,051 --> 00:00:58,125
understand all the words which he spake.

22
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:00,725
4 And it came to pass that after

23
00:01:00,725 --> 00:01:03,325
he had done all this, that king

24
00:01:03,325 --> 00:01:05,925
Limhi dismissed the multitude,

25
00:01:05,925 --> 00:01:08,525
and caused that they should

26
00:01:08,525 --> 00:01:11,004
return every one unto his own house.

27
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:12,147
5 And it came to pass that

28
00:01:12,147 --> 00:01:13,29
he caused that the plates

29
00:01:13,29 --> 00:01:14,433
which contained the record of

30
00:01:14,433 --> 00:01:15,576
his people from the time that

31
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:16,719
they left the land of

32
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:17,862
Zarahemla, should be brought

33
00:01:17,862 --> 00:01:19,98
before Ammon, that he might read them.

34
00:01:19,98 --> 00:01:19,98
6 Now, as soon as Ammon

35
00:01:19,98 --> 00:01:19,98
had read the record, the

36
00:01:19,98 --> 00:01:19,98
king inquired of him to

37
00:01:19,98 --> 00:01:19,98
know if he could

38
00:01:19,98 --> 00:01:19,98
interpret languages, and Ammon

39
00:01:19,98 --> 00:01:19,046
told him that he could not.

40
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:18,963
7 And the king said

41
00:01:18,963 --> 00:01:18,88
unto him: Being grieved

42
00:01:18,88 --> 00:01:18,797
for the afflictions of my

43
00:01:18,797 --> 00:01:18,714
people, I caused that

44
00:01:18,714 --> 00:01:18,631
forty and three of my

45
00:01:18,631 --> 00:01:18,548
people should take a

46
00:01:18,548 --> 00:01:18,465
journey into the

47
00:01:18,465 --> 00:01:18,382
wilderness, that thereby they

48
00:01:18,382 --> 00:01:18,299
might find the land of

49
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:18,216
Zarahemla, that we might

50
00:01:18,216 --> 00:01:18,133
appeal unto our

51
00:01:18,133 --> 00:01:18,111
brethren to deliver us out of bondage.

52
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:18,511
8 And they were lost

53
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:18,911
in the wilderness for

54
00:01:18,911 --> 00:01:19,311
the space of many days,

55
00:01:19,311 --> 00:01:19,711
yet they were

56
00:01:19,711 --> 00:01:20,111
diligent, and found not the

57
00:01:20,111 --> 00:01:20,511
land of Zarahemla but

58
00:01:20,511 --> 00:01:20,911
returned to this land,

59
00:01:20,911 --> 00:01:21,311
having traveled in a

60
00:01:21,311 --> 00:01:21,711
land among many waters,

61
00:01:21,711 --> 00:01:22,111
having discovered a

62
00:01:22,111 --> 00:01:22,511
land which was covered

63
00:01:22,511 --> 00:01:22,911
with bones of men, and

64
00:01:22,911 --> 00:01:23,311
of beasts, and was

65
00:01:23,311 --> 00:01:23,711
also covered with ruins

66
00:01:23,711 --> 00:01:24,111
of buildings of every

67
00:01:24,111 --> 00:01:24,511
kind, having

68
00:01:24,511 --> 00:01:24,911
discovered a land which had

69
00:01:24,911 --> 00:01:25,311
been peopled with a

70
00:01:25,311 --> 00:01:25,711
people who were as numerous

71
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:26,086
as the hosts of Israel.

72
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,461
9 And for a

73
00:01:27,461 --> 00:01:28,836
testimony that the things

74
00:01:28,836 --> 00:01:30,211
that they had said are

75
00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:31,586
true they have

76
00:01:31,586 --> 00:01:32,961
brought twenty-four

77
00:01:32,961 --> 00:01:34,336
plates which are filled

78
00:01:34,336 --> 00:01:35,711
with engravings, and

79
00:01:35,711 --> 00:01:37,998
they are of pure gold.

80
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:39,998
10 And behold,

81
00:01:39,998 --> 00:01:41,998
also, they have

82
00:01:41,998 --> 00:01:43,998
brought breastplates,

83
00:01:43,998 --> 00:01:45,998
which are large,

84
00:01:45,998 --> 00:01:47,998
and they are of

85
00:01:47,998 --> 00:01:49,998
brass and of copper,

86
00:01:49,998 --> 00:01:51,345
and are perfectly sound.

87
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:52,845
11 And again,

88
00:01:52,845 --> 00:01:54,345
they have brought

89
00:01:54,345 --> 00:01:55,845
swords, the hilts

90
00:01:55,845 --> 00:01:57,345
thereof have

91
00:01:57,345 --> 00:01:58,845
perished, and the

92
00:01:58,845 --> 00:02:00,345
blades thereof were

93
00:02:00,345 --> 00:02:01,845
cankered with

94
00:02:01,845 --> 00:02:03,345
rust; and there is no

95
00:02:03,345 --> 00:02:04,845
one in the land

96
00:02:04,845 --> 00:02:06,345
that is able to

97
00:02:06,345 --> 00:02:07,845
interpret the

98
00:02:07,845 --> 00:02:09,345
language or the

99
00:02:09,345 --> 00:02:10,845
engravings that are on

100
00:02:10,845 --> 00:02:12,345
the plates.

101
00:02:12,345 --> 00:02:13,845
Therefore I said unto

102
00:02:13,845 --> 00:02:15,736
thee: Canst thou translate?

103
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:16,656
12 And I say

104
00:02:16,656 --> 00:02:17,576
unto thee again:

105
00:02:17,576 --> 00:02:18,496
Knowest thou of

106
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,416
any one that can

107
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:20,336
translate? For I

108
00:02:20,336 --> 00:02:21,256
am desirous that

109
00:02:21,256 --> 00:02:22,176
these records

110
00:02:22,176 --> 00:02:23,096
should be

111
00:02:23,096 --> 00:02:24,016
translated into our

112
00:02:24,016 --> 00:02:24,936
language; for,

113
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:25,856
perhaps, they will

114
00:02:25,856 --> 00:02:26,776
give us a

115
00:02:26,776 --> 00:02:27,696
knowledge of a remnant

116
00:02:27,696 --> 00:02:28,616
of the people

117
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:29,536
who have been

118
00:02:29,536 --> 00:02:30,456
destroyed, from

119
00:02:30,456 --> 00:02:31,376
whence these records

120
00:02:31,376 --> 00:02:32,296
came; or,

121
00:02:32,296 --> 00:02:33,216
perhaps, they will

122
00:02:33,216 --> 00:02:34,136
give us a

123
00:02:34,136 --> 00:02:35,056
knowledge of this very

124
00:02:35,056 --> 00:02:35,976
people who have

125
00:02:35,976 --> 00:02:36,896
been destroyed;

126
00:02:36,896 --> 00:02:37,816
and I am desirous

127
00:02:37,816 --> 00:02:38,725
to know the cause of their destruction.

128
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:39,118
13 Now Ammon

129
00:02:39,118 --> 00:02:39,511
said unto him: I

130
00:02:39,511 --> 00:02:39,904
can assuredly

131
00:02:39,904 --> 00:02:40,297
tell thee, O

132
00:02:40,297 --> 00:02:40,69
king, of a man

133
00:02:40,69 --> 00:02:41,083
that can translate

134
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:41,476
the records;

135
00:02:41,476 --> 00:02:41,869
for he has

136
00:02:41,869 --> 00:02:42,262
wherewith that he

137
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:42,655
can look, and

138
00:02:42,655 --> 00:02:43,048
translate all

139
00:02:43,048 --> 00:02:43,441
records that are of

140
00:02:43,441 --> 00:02:43,834
ancient date;

141
00:02:43,834 --> 00:02:44,227
and it is a

142
00:02:44,227 --> 00:02:44,62
gift from God. And

143
00:02:44,62 --> 00:02:45,013
the things are

144
00:02:45,013 --> 00:02:45,406
called

145
00:02:45,406 --> 00:02:45,799
interpreters, and no

146
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:46,192
man can look in

147
00:02:46,192 --> 00:02:46,585
them except he

148
00:02:46,585 --> 00:02:46,978
be commanded,

149
00:02:46,978 --> 00:02:47,371
lest he should

150
00:02:47,371 --> 00:02:47,764
look for that he

151
00:02:47,764 --> 00:02:48,157
ought not and

152
00:02:48,157 --> 00:02:48,55
he should

153
00:02:48,55 --> 00:02:48,943
perish. And

154
00:02:48,943 --> 00:02:49,336
whosoever is commanded

155
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:49,102
to look in them, the same is called seer.

156
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:49,011
14 And behold,

157
00:02:49,011 --> 00:02:48,92
the king of

158
00:02:48,92 --> 00:02:48,829
the people who

159
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:48,738
are in the

160
00:02:48,738 --> 00:02:48,647
land of Zarahemla

161
00:02:48,647 --> 00:02:48,556
is the man

162
00:02:48,556 --> 00:02:48,465
that is

163
00:02:48,465 --> 00:02:48,374
commanded to do these

164
00:02:48,374 --> 00:02:48,283
things, and

165
00:02:48,283 --> 00:02:48,192
who has this

166
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:48,168
high gift from God.

167
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,568
15 And the

168
00:02:49,568 --> 00:02:50,968
king said

169
00:02:50,968 --> 00:02:52,368
that a seer

170
00:02:52,368 --> 00:02:53,768
is greater

171
00:02:53,768 --> 00:02:55,675
than a prophet.

172
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:55,627
16 And

173
00:02:55,627 --> 00:02:55,579
Ammon said

174
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:55,531
that a seer

175
00:02:55,531 --> 00:02:55,483
is a

176
00:02:55,483 --> 00:02:55,435
revelator and a

177
00:02:55,435 --> 00:02:55,387
prophet

178
00:02:55,387 --> 00:02:55,339
also; and a

179
00:02:55,339 --> 00:02:55,292
gift

180
00:02:55,292 --> 00:02:55,244
which is

181
00:02:55,244 --> 00:02:55,196
greater can no

182
00:02:55,196 --> 00:02:55,148
man have,

183
00:02:55,148 --> 00:02:55,1
except he

184
00:02:55,1 --> 00:02:55,052
should

185
00:02:55,052 --> 00:02:55,004
possess the

186
00:02:55,004 --> 00:02:54,956
power of

187
00:02:54,956 --> 00:02:54,907
God, which

188
00:02:54,907 --> 00:02:54,859
no man can;

189
00:02:54,859 --> 00:02:54,811
yet a man

190
00:02:54,811 --> 00:02:54,763
may have

191
00:02:54,763 --> 00:02:54,715
great

192
00:02:54,715 --> 00:02:54,741
power given him from God.

193
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:54,824
17 But a

194
00:02:54,824 --> 00:02:54,907
seer can

195
00:02:54,907 --> 00:02:54,99
know of

196
00:02:54,99 --> 00:02:55,073
things

197
00:02:55,073 --> 00:02:55,156
which are

198
00:02:55,156 --> 00:02:55,239
past, and

199
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:55,322
also of

200
00:02:55,322 --> 00:02:55,405
things

201
00:02:55,405 --> 00:02:55,488
which are to

202
00:02:55,488 --> 00:02:55,571
come, and

203
00:02:55,571 --> 00:02:55,654
by them

204
00:02:55,654 --> 00:02:55,737
shall all

205
00:02:55,737 --> 00:02:55,82
things

206
00:02:55,82 --> 00:02:55,903
be

207
00:02:55,903 --> 00:02:55,986
revealed, or,

208
00:02:55,986 --> 00:02:56,069
rather,

209
00:02:56,069 --> 00:02:56,152
shall secret

210
00:02:56,152 --> 00:02:56,235
things

211
00:02:56,235 --> 00:02:56,318
be made

212
00:02:56,318 --> 00:02:56,401
manifest,

213
00:02:56,401 --> 00:02:56,484
and hidden

214
00:02:56,484 --> 00:02:56,567
things

215
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:56,65
shall come

216
00:02:56,65 --> 00:02:56,733
to

217
00:02:56,733 --> 00:02:56,816
light, and

218
00:02:56,816 --> 00:02:56,899
things which

219
00:02:56,899 --> 00:02:56,982
are not

220
00:02:56,982 --> 00:02:57,065
known

221
00:02:57,065 --> 00:02:57,148
shall be

222
00:02:57,148 --> 00:02:57,231
made known

223
00:02:57,231 --> 00:02:57,314
by them,

224
00:02:57,314 --> 00:02:57,397
and also

225
00:02:57,397 --> 00:02:57,48
things

226
00:02:57,48 --> 00:02:57,563
shall be

227
00:02:57,563 --> 00:02:57,646
made known

228
00:02:57,646 --> 00:02:57,144
by them which otherwise could not be known.

229
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:58,085
18 Thus

230
00:02:58,085 --> 00:02:59,026
God has

231
00:02:59,026 --> 00:02:59,967
provided

232
00:02:59,967 --> 00:03:00,908
a means

233
00:03:00,908 --> 00:03:01,849
that

234
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:02,79
man,

235
00:03:02,79 --> 00:03:03,731
through

236
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:04,672
faith, might

237
00:03:04,672 --> 00:03:05,613
work

238
00:03:05,613 --> 00:03:06,554
mighty

239
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:07,495
miracles;

240
00:03:07,495 --> 00:03:08,436
therefore

241
00:03:08,436 --> 00:03:09,377
he

242
00:03:09,377 --> 00:03:10,318
becometh a

243
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:11,259
great

244
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:12,2
benefit to

245
00:03:12,2 --> 00:03:13,06
his fellow beings.

246
00:03:13,06 --> 00:03:13,244
19 And

247
00:03:13,244 --> 00:03:13,428
now, when

248
00:03:13,428 --> 00:03:13,612
Ammon

249
00:03:13,612 --> 00:03:13,796
had made

250
00:03:13,796 --> 00:03:13,98
an end

251
00:03:13,98 --> 00:03:14,164
of

252
00:03:14,164 --> 00:03:14,348
speaking these

253
00:03:14,348 --> 00:03:14,532
words

254
00:03:14,532 --> 00:03:14,716
the king

255
00:03:14,716 --> 00:03:14,9
rejoiced

256
00:03:14,9 --> 00:03:15,084


257
00:03:15,084 --> 00:03:15,268
exceedingly,

258
00:03:15,268 --> 00:03:15,452
and gave

259
00:03:15,452 --> 00:03:15,636
thanks to

260
00:03:15,636 --> 00:03:15,82
God,

261
00:03:15,82 --> 00:03:16,004
saying:

262
00:03:16,004 --> 00:03:16,188
Doubtless

263
00:03:16,188 --> 00:03:16,372
a great

264
00:03:16,372 --> 00:03:16,556
mystery

265
00:03:16,556 --> 00:03:16,74
is

266
00:03:16,74 --> 00:03:16,924
contained

267
00:03:16,924 --> 00:03:17,108
within

268
00:03:17,108 --> 00:03:17,292
these

269
00:03:17,292 --> 00:03:17,476
plates, and

270
00:03:17,476 --> 00:03:17,66
these

271
00:03:17,66 --> 00:03:17,844
interpreters

272
00:03:17,844 --> 00:03:18,028
were

273
00:03:18,028 --> 00:03:18,212
doubtless

274
00:03:18,212 --> 00:03:18,396

275
00:03:18,396 --> 00:03:18,58

all such

280
00:03:19,316 --> 00:03:19,5
