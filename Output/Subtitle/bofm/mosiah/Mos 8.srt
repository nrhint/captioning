00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:13,75
Chapter 8 Ammon teaches the people of Limhi—He

2
00:00:13,75 --> 00:00:27,5
 learns of the twenty-four Jaredite plates—Ancient

3
00:00:27,5 --> 00:00:41,25
 records can be translated by seers—No gift is greater

4
00:00:41,25 --> 00:00:55,0
 than seership. About 121 B.C.

5
00:00:55,656 --> 00:01:01,489
1 And it came to pass that after king Limhi had

6
00:01:01,489 --> 00:01:07,322
 made an end of speaking to his people, for he spake

7
00:01:07,322 --> 00:01:13,155
 many things unto them and only a few of them have

8
00:01:13,155 --> 00:01:18,988
 I written in this book, he told his people all the

9
00:01:18,988 --> 00:01:24,821
 things concerning their brethren who were in the

10
00:01:24,821 --> 00:01:30,654
 land of Zarahemla

11
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:46,457
2 And he caused that Ammon should stand up before

12
00:01:46,457 --> 00:02:02,457
 the multitude, and rehearse unto them all that had

13
00:02:02,457 --> 00:02:18,457
 happened unto their brethren from the time that

14
00:02:18,457 --> 00:02:34,457
 Zeniff went up out of the land even until the time

15
00:02:34,457 --> 00:02:50,457
 that he himself came up out of the land

16
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:52,203
3 And he also rehearsed unto them the last words

17
00:02:52,203 --> 00:02:54,203
 which king Benjamin had taught them, and explained

18
00:02:54,203 --> 00:02:56,203
 them to the people of king Limhi, so that they

19
00:02:56,203 --> 00:02:58,203
 might understand all the words which he spake

20
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:02,178
4 And it came to pass that after he had done all

21
00:03:02,178 --> 00:03:06,178
 this, that king Limhi dismissed the multitude, and

22
00:03:06,178 --> 00:03:10,178
 caused that they should return every one unto his

23
00:03:10,178 --> 00:03:14,178
 own house

24
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:14,927
5 And it came to pass that he caused that the

25
00:03:14,927 --> 00:03:15,727
 plates which contained the record of his people from

26
00:03:15,727 --> 00:03:16,527
 the time that they left the land of Zarahemla,

27
00:03:16,527 --> 00:03:17,327
 should be brought before Ammon, that he might read

28
00:03:17,327 --> 00:03:18,127
 them

29
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:21,265
6 Now, as soon as Ammon had read the record, the

30
00:03:21,265 --> 00:03:24,265
 king inquired of him to know if he could interpret

31
00:03:24,265 --> 00:03:27,265
 languages, and Ammon told him that he could not

32
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:44,341
7 And the king said unto him: Being grieved for

33
00:03:44,341 --> 00:04:01,508
 the afflictions of my people, I caused that forty

34
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:18,675
 and three of my people should take a journey into

35
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:35,842
 the wilderness, that thereby they might find the

36
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:53,009
 land of Zarahemla, that we might appeal unto our

37
00:04:53,009 --> 00:05:10,176
 brethren to deliver us out of bondage

38
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:11,733
8 And they were lost in the wilderness for the

39
00:05:11,733 --> 00:05:12,622
 space of many days, yet they were diligent, and found

40
00:05:12,622 --> 00:05:13,511
 not the land of Zarahemla but returned to this

41
00:05:13,511 --> 00:05:14,4
 land, having traveled in a land among many waters,

42
00:05:14,4 --> 00:05:15,289
 having discovered a land which was covered with

43
00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:16,178
 bones of men, and of beasts, and was also covered

44
00:05:16,178 --> 00:05:17,067
 with ruins of buildings of every kind, having

45
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:17,956
 discovered a land which had been peopled with a people

46
00:05:17,956 --> 00:05:18,845
 who were as numerous as the hosts of Israel

47
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:19,068
9 And for a testimony that the things that they

48
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:19,318
 had said are true they have brought twenty-four

49
00:05:19,318 --> 00:05:19,568
 plates which are filled with engravings, and they are

50
00:05:19,568 --> 00:05:19,818
 of pure gold

51
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:22,086
10 And behold, also, they have brought

52
00:05:22,086 --> 00:05:24,753
 breastplates, which are large, and they are of brass and of

53
00:05:24,753 --> 00:05:27,42
 copper, and are perfectly sound

54
00:05:27,16 --> 00:05:31,16
11 And again, they have brought swords, the hilts

55
00:05:31,16 --> 00:05:35,16
 thereof have perished, and the blades thereof were

56
00:05:35,16 --> 00:05:39,16
 cankered with rust; and there is no one in the

57
00:05:39,16 --> 00:05:43,16
 land that is able to interpret the language or the

58
00:05:43,16 --> 00:05:47,16
 engravings that are on the plates. Therefore I said

59
00:05:47,16 --> 00:05:51,16
 unto thee: Canst thou translate

60
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:51,973
12 And I say unto thee again: Knowest thou of any

61
00:05:51,973 --> 00:05:52,862
 one that can translate? For I am desirous that

62
00:05:52,862 --> 00:05:53,751
 these records should be translated into our language;

63
00:05:53,751 --> 00:05:54,64
 for, perhaps, they will give us a knowledge of a

64
00:05:54,64 --> 00:05:55,529
 remnant of the people who have been destroyed,

65
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:56,418
 from whence these records came; or, perhaps, they

66
00:05:56,418 --> 00:05:57,307
 will give us a knowledge of this very people who have

67
00:05:57,307 --> 00:05:58,196
 been destroyed; and I am desirous to know the

68
00:05:58,196 --> 00:05:59,085
 cause of their destruction

69
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:03,392
13 Now Ammon said unto him: I can assuredly tell

70
00:06:03,392 --> 00:06:07,725
 thee, O king, of a man that can translate the

71
00:06:07,725 --> 00:06:12,058
 records; for he has wherewith that he can look, and

72
00:06:12,058 --> 00:06:16,391
 translate all records that are of ancient date; and

73
00:06:16,391 --> 00:06:20,724
 it is a gift from God. And the things are called

74
00:06:20,724 --> 00:06:25,057
 interpreters, and no man can look in them except he

75
00:06:25,057 --> 00:06:29,39
 be commanded, lest he should look for that he

76
00:06:29,39 --> 00:06:33,723
 ought not and he should perish. And whosoever is

77
00:06:33,723 --> 00:06:38,056
 commanded to look in them, the same is called seer

78
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:46,932
14 And behold, the king of the people who are in

79
00:06:46,932 --> 00:06:54,932
 the land of Zarahemla is the man that is commanded

80
00:06:54,932 --> 00:07:02,932
 to do these things, and who has this high gift

81
00:07:02,932 --> 00:07:10,932
 from God

82
00:07:10,83 --> 00:07:18,83
15 And the king said that a seer is greater than a

83
00:07:18,83 --> 00:07:26,83
 prophet

84
00:07:26,78 --> 00:07:29,98
16 And Ammon said that a seer is a revelator and a

85
00:07:29,98 --> 00:07:33,18
 prophet also; and a gift which is greater can no

86
00:07:33,18 --> 00:07:36,38
 man have, except he should possess the power of

87
00:07:36,38 --> 00:07:39,58
 God, which no man can; yet a man may have great

88
00:07:39,58 --> 00:07:42,78
 power given him from God

89
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:43,104
17 But a seer can know of things which are past,

90
00:07:43,104 --> 00:07:43,479
 and also of things which are to come, and by them

91
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:43,854
 shall all things be revealed, or, rather, shall

92
00:07:43,854 --> 00:07:44,229
 secret things be made manifest, and hidden things

93
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:44,604
 shall come to light, and things which are not known

94
00:07:44,604 --> 00:07:44,979
 shall be made known by them, and also things shall

95
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:45,354
 be made known by them which otherwise could not be

96
00:07:45,354 --> 00:07:45,729
 known

97
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:48,532
18 Thus God has provided a means that man, through

98
00:07:48,532 --> 00:07:51,199
 faith, might work mighty miracles; therefore he

99
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,866
 becometh a great benefit to his fellow beings

100
00:07:53,84 --> 00:07:54,983
19 And now, when Ammon had made an end of speaking

101
00:07:54,983 --> 00:07:56,126
 these words the king rejoiced exceedingly, and

102
00:07:56,126 --> 00:07:57,269
 gave thanks to God, saying: Doubtless a great

103
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:58,412
 mystery is contained within these plates, and these

104
00:07:58,412 --> 00:07:59,555
 interpreters were doubtless prepared for the purpose

105
00:07:59,555 --> 00:08:00,698
 of unfolding all such mysteries to the children of

106
00:08:00,698 --> 00:08:01,841
 men

107
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:04,482
20 O how marvelous are the works of the Lord, and

108
00:08:04,482 --> 00:08:07,149
 how long doth he suffer with his people; yea, and

109
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:09,816
 how blind and impenetrable are the understandings

110
00:08:09,816 --> 00:08:12,483
 of the children of men; for they will not seek

111
00:08:12,483 --> 00:08:15,15
 wisdom, neither do they desire that she should rule

112
00:08:15,15 --> 00:08:17,817
 over them

113
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:19,097
21 Yea, they are as a wild flock which fleeth from

114
00:08:19,097 --> 00:08:20,43
 the shepherd, and scattereth, and are driven, and

115
00:08:20,43 --> 00:08:21,763
 are devoured by the beasts of the forest.
