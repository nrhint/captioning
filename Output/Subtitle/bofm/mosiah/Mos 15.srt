1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:05,8
Chapter 15 How Christ is both the Father and the

2
00:00:05,8 --> 00:00:11,6
Son—He will make intercession and bear the

3
00:00:11,6 --> 00:00:17,4
transgressions of His people—They and all the holy

4
00:00:17,4 --> 00:00:23,2
prophets are His seed—He brings to pass the

5
00:00:23,2 --> 00:00:29,763
Resurrection—Little children have eternal life. About 148 B.C. 

6
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:35,513
1 And now Abinadi said unto them: I

7
00:00:35,513 --> 00:00:41,263
would that ye should understand that God

8
00:00:41,263 --> 00:00:47,013
himself shall come down among the

9
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:52,052
children of men, and shall redeem his people.

10
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:52,852
2 And because he dwelleth in

11
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:53,652
flesh he shall be called the Son

12
00:00:53,652 --> 00:00:54,452
of God, and having subjected

13
00:00:54,452 --> 00:00:55,252
the flesh to the will of the

14
00:00:55,252 --> 00:00:56,456
Father, being the Father and the Son—

15
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:56,256
3 The Father, because he

16
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:56,056
was conceived by the

17
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:55,856
power of God; and the Son,

18
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:55,656
because of the flesh; thus

19
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:55,522
becoming the Father and Son—

20
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:56,522
4 And they are one

21
00:00:56,522 --> 00:00:57,522
God, yea, the very

22
00:00:57,522 --> 00:00:58,522
Eternal Father of

23
00:00:58,522 --> 00:00:59,927
heaven and of earth.

24
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:01,158
5 And thus the

25
00:01:01,158 --> 00:01:02,389
flesh becoming

26
00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:03,62
subject to the Spirit,

27
00:01:03,62 --> 00:01:04,851
or the Son to the

28
00:01:04,851 --> 00:01:06,082
Father, being one

29
00:01:06,082 --> 00:01:07,313
God, suffereth

30
00:01:07,313 --> 00:01:08,544
temptation, and

31
00:01:08,544 --> 00:01:09,775
yieldeth not to the

32
00:01:09,775 --> 00:01:11,006
temptation, but

33
00:01:11,006 --> 00:01:12,237
suffereth himself to be

34
00:01:12,237 --> 00:01:13,468
mocked, and

35
00:01:13,468 --> 00:01:14,699
scourged, and cast out,

36
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:15,409
and disowned by his people.

37
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:15,591
6 And after all

38
00:01:15,591 --> 00:01:15,773
this, after

39
00:01:15,773 --> 00:01:15,955
working many mighty

40
00:01:15,955 --> 00:01:16,137
miracles among the

41
00:01:16,137 --> 00:01:16,319
children of men,

42
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:16,501
he shall be led,

43
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:16,683
yea, even as

44
00:01:16,683 --> 00:01:16,865
Isaiah said, as a

45
00:01:16,865 --> 00:01:17,047
sheep before the

46
00:01:17,047 --> 00:01:17,229
shearer is dumb, so

47
00:01:17,229 --> 00:01:17,811
he opened not his mouth.

48
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:18,711
7 Yea, even so

49
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:19,611
he shall be led,

50
00:01:19,611 --> 00:01:20,511
crucified, and

51
00:01:20,511 --> 00:01:21,411
slain, the flesh

52
00:01:21,411 --> 00:01:22,311
becoming subject

53
00:01:22,311 --> 00:01:23,211
even unto

54
00:01:23,211 --> 00:01:24,111
death, the will of

55
00:01:24,111 --> 00:01:25,011
the Son being

56
00:01:25,011 --> 00:01:25,911
swallowed up in the

57
00:01:25,911 --> 00:01:26,219
will of the Father.

58
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:27,219
8 And thus God

59
00:01:27,219 --> 00:01:28,219
breaketh the

60
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:29,219
bands of

61
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:30,219
death, having

62
00:01:30,219 --> 00:01:31,219
gained the victory

63
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:32,219
over death;

64
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:33,219
giving the Son

65
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:34,219
power to make

66
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,219
intercession

67
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:36,129
for the children of men—

68
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:36,72
9 Having

69
00:01:36,72 --> 00:01:37,311
ascended into

70
00:01:37,311 --> 00:01:37,902
heaven, having

71
00:01:37,902 --> 00:01:38,493
the bowels of

72
00:01:38,493 --> 00:01:39,084
mercy; being

73
00:01:39,084 --> 00:01:39,675
filled with

74
00:01:39,675 --> 00:01:40,266
compassion

75
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:40,857
towards the

76
00:01:40,857 --> 00:01:41,448
children of men;

77
00:01:41,448 --> 00:01:42,039
standing

78
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:42,63
betwixt them and

79
00:01:42,63 --> 00:01:43,221
justice;

80
00:01:43,221 --> 00:01:43,812
having broken the

81
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:44,403
bands of

82
00:01:44,403 --> 00:01:44,994
death, taken

83
00:01:44,994 --> 00:01:45,585
upon himself

84
00:01:45,585 --> 00:01:46,176
their iniquity

85
00:01:46,176 --> 00:01:46,767
and their

86
00:01:46,767 --> 00:01:47,358
transgressions,

87
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:47,949
having

88
00:01:47,949 --> 00:01:48,54
redeemed them, and

89
00:01:48,54 --> 00:01:49,943
satisfied the demands of justice.

90
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:50,318
10 And now I

91
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:50,693
say unto you,

92
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:51,068
who shall

93
00:01:51,068 --> 00:01:51,443
declare his

94
00:01:51,443 --> 00:01:51,818
generation?

95
00:01:51,818 --> 00:01:52,193
Behold, I say

96
00:01:52,193 --> 00:01:52,568
unto you, that

97
00:01:52,568 --> 00:01:52,943
when his soul

98
00:01:52,943 --> 00:01:53,318
has been made

99
00:01:53,318 --> 00:01:53,693
an offering

100
00:01:53,693 --> 00:01:54,068
for sin he

101
00:01:54,068 --> 00:01:54,443
shall see his

102
00:01:54,443 --> 00:01:54,818
seed. And now

103
00:01:54,818 --> 00:01:55,193
what say ye?

104
00:01:55,193 --> 00:01:55,568
And who shall

105
00:01:55,568 --> 00:01:55,349
be his seed?

106
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:55,643
11 Behold I

107
00:01:55,643 --> 00:01:55,937
say unto

108
00:01:55,937 --> 00:01:56,231
you, that

109
00:01:56,231 --> 00:01:56,525
whosoever has

110
00:01:56,525 --> 00:01:56,819
heard the words

111
00:01:56,819 --> 00:01:57,113
of the

112
00:01:57,113 --> 00:01:57,407
prophets, yea,

113
00:01:57,407 --> 00:01:57,701
all the holy

114
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:57,995
prophets who

115
00:01:57,995 --> 00:01:58,289
have

116
00:01:58,289 --> 00:01:58,583
prophesied

117
00:01:58,583 --> 00:01:58,877
concerning the

118
00:01:58,877 --> 00:01:59,171
coming of the

119
00:01:59,171 --> 00:01:59,465
Lord—I say

120
00:01:59,465 --> 00:01:59,759
unto you, that

121
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:00,053
all those

122
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:00,347
who have

123
00:02:00,347 --> 00:02:00,641
hearkened unto

124
00:02:00,641 --> 00:02:00,935
their words,

125
00:02:00,935 --> 00:02:01,229
and believed

126
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:01,523
that the

127
00:02:01,523 --> 00:02:01,817
Lord would

128
00:02:01,817 --> 00:02:02,111
redeem his

129
00:02:02,111 --> 00:02:02,405
people, and have

130
00:02:02,405 --> 00:02:02,699
looked

131
00:02:02,699 --> 00:02:02,993
forward to that

132
00:02:02,993 --> 00:02:03,287
day for a

133
00:02:03,287 --> 00:02:03,581
remission of

134
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:03,875
their sins, I

135
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:04,169
say unto

136
00:02:04,169 --> 00:02:04,463
you, that these

137
00:02:04,463 --> 00:02:04,757
are his

138
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:05,051
seed, or they

139
00:02:05,051 --> 00:02:05,258
are the heirs of the kingdom of God.

140
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:05,472
12 For

141
00:02:05,472 --> 00:02:05,686
these are they

142
00:02:05,686 --> 00:02:05,9
whose sins

143
00:02:05,9 --> 00:02:06,114
he has

144
00:02:06,114 --> 00:02:06,328
borne; these

145
00:02:06,328 --> 00:02:06,542
are they for

146
00:02:06,542 --> 00:02:06,756
whom he has

147
00:02:06,756 --> 00:02:06,97
died, to

148
00:02:06,97 --> 00:02:07,184
redeem them

149
00:02:07,184 --> 00:02:07,398
from their

150
00:02:07,398 --> 00:02:07,612


151
00:02:07,612 --> 00:02:07,826
transgressions. And

152
00:02:07,826 --> 00:02:08,04
now, are they

153
00:02:08,04 --> 00:02:08,729
not his seed?

154
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:09,379
13 Yea,

155
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,029
and are not

156
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:10,679
the

157
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:11,329
prophets, every

158
00:02:11,329 --> 00:02:11,979
one that

159
00:02:11,979 --> 00:02:12,629
has opened

160
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:13,279
his mouth

161
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:13,929
to

162
00:02:13,929 --> 00:02:14,579
prophesy, that

163
00:02:14,579 --> 00:02:15,229
has not

164
00:02:15,229 --> 00:02:15,879
fallen into

165
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:16,529


166
00:02:16,529 --> 00:02:17,179
transgression, I mean

167
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:17,829
all the

168
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:18,479
holy

169
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,129
prophets ever

170
00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:19,779
since the

171
00:02:19,779 --> 00:02:20,429
world began?

172
00:02:20,429 --> 00:02:21,079
I say unto

173
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:21,074
you that they are his seed.

174
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:21,886
14 And

175
00:02:21,886 --> 00:02:22,698
these are

176
00:02:22,698 --> 00:02:23,51
they who

177
00:02:23,51 --> 00:02:24,322
have

178
00:02:24,322 --> 00:02:25,134
published

179
00:02:25,134 --> 00:02:25,946
peace, who

180
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:26,758
have

181
00:02:26,758 --> 00:02:27,57
brought good

182
00:02:27,57 --> 00:02:28,382
tidings of

183
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:29,194
good, who

184
00:02:29,194 --> 00:02:30,006
have

185
00:02:30,006 --> 00:02:30,818
published

186
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:31,63
salvation;

187
00:02:31,63 --> 00:02:32,442
and said

188
00:02:32,442 --> 00:02:33,254
unto

189
00:02:33,254 --> 00:02:34,888
Zion: Thy God reigneth!

190
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:37,459
15 And O

191
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:40,03
how

192
00:02:40,03 --> 00:02:42,601
beautiful

193
00:02:42,601 --> 00:02:45,172
upon the

194
00:02:45,172 --> 00:02:47,743


195
00:02:47,743 --> 00:02:50,314
mountains were

196
00:02:50,314 --> 00:02:52,739
their feet!

197
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:53,816
16 And

198
00:02:53,816 --> 00:02:54,893
again,

199
00:02:54,893 --> 00:02:55,97
how

200
00:02:55,97 --> 00:02:57,047
beautiful

201
00:02:57,047 --> 00:02:58,124
upon

202
00:02:58,124 --> 00:02:59,201
the

203
00:02:59,201 --> 00:03:00,278
mountains

204
00:03:00,278 --> 00:03:01,355
are the

205
00:03:01,355 --> 00:03:02,432
