1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 15 How Christ is both the Father and the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Son—He will make intercession and bear the

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
transgressions of His people—They and all the holy

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
prophets are His seed—He brings to pass the

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:06:27,
Resurrection—Little children have eternal life. About 148 B.C. 

6
00:06:27,0 --> 00:06:27,0
1 And now Abinadi said unto them: I

7
00:06:27,0 --> 00:06:27,0
would that ye should understand that God

8
00:06:27,0 --> 00:06:27,0
himself shall come down among the

9
00:06:27,0 --> 00:05:59,
children of men, and shall redeem his people.

10
00:05:59,0 --> 00:05:59,0
2 And because he dwelleth in

11
00:05:59,0 --> 00:05:59,0
flesh he shall be called the Son

12
00:05:59,0 --> 00:05:59,0
of God, and having subjected

13
00:05:59,0 --> 00:05:59,0
the flesh to the will of the

14
00:05:59,0 --> 00:07:43,
Father, being the Father and the Son—

15
00:07:43,0 --> 00:07:43,0
3 The Father, because he

16
00:07:43,0 --> 00:07:43,0
was conceived by the

17
00:07:43,0 --> 00:07:43,0
power of God; and the Son,

18
00:07:43,0 --> 00:07:43,0
because of the flesh; thus

19
00:07:43,0 --> 00:11:41,
becoming the Father and Son—

20
00:11:41,0 --> 00:11:41,0
4 And they are one

21
00:11:41,0 --> 00:11:41,0
God, yea, the very

22
00:11:41,0 --> 00:11:41,0
Eternal Father of

23
00:11:41,0 --> 00:25:36,
heaven and of earth.

24
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
5 And thus the

25
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
flesh becoming

26
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
subject to the Spirit,

27
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
or the Son to the

28
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
Father, being one

29
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
God, suffereth

30
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
temptation, and

31
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
yieldeth not to the

32
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
temptation, but

33
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
suffereth himself to be

34
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
mocked, and

35
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
scourged, and cast out,

36
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:22,
and disowned by his people.

37
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
6 And after all

38
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
this, after

39
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
working many mighty

40
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
miracles among the

41
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
children of men,

42
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
he shall be led,

43
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
yea, even as

44
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
Isaiah said, as a

45
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
sheep before the

46
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
shearer is dumb, so

47
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:36,
he opened not his mouth.

48
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
7 Yea, even so

49
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
he shall be led,

50
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
crucified, and

51
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
slain, the flesh

52
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
becoming subject

53
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
even unto

54
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
death, the will of

55
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
the Son being

56
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
swallowed up in the

57
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:22,
will of the Father.

58
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
8 And thus God

59
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
breaketh the

60
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
bands of

61
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
death, having

62
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
gained the victory

63
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
over death;

64
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
giving the Son

65
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
power to make

66
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
intercession

67
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:36,
for the children of men—

68
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
9 Having

69
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
ascended into

70
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
heaven, having

71
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
the bowels of

72
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
mercy; being

73
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
filled with

74
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
compassion

75
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
towards the

76
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
children of men;

77
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
standing

78
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
betwixt them and

79
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
justice;

80
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
having broken the

81
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
bands of

82
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
death, taken

83
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
upon himself

84
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
their iniquity

85
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
and their

86
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
transgressions,

87
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
having

88
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
redeemed them, and

89
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:22,
satisfied the demands of justice.

90
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
10 And now I

91
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
say unto you,

92
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
who shall

93
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
declare his

94
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
generation?

95
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
Behold, I say

96
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
unto you, that

97
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
when his soul

98
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
has been made

99
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
an offering

100
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
for sin he

101
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
shall see his

102
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
seed. And now

103
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
what say ye?

104
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
And who shall

105
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:36,
be his seed?

106
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
11 Behold I

107
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
say unto

108
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
you, that

109
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
whosoever has

110
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
heard the words

111
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
of the

112
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
prophets, yea,

113
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
all the holy

114
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
prophets who

115
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
have

116
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
prophesied

117
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
concerning the

118
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
coming of the

119
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
Lord—I say

120
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
unto you, that

121
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
all those

122
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
who have

123
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
hearkened unto

124
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
their words,

125
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
and believed

126
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
that the

127
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
Lord would

128
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
redeem his

129
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
people, and have

130
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
looked

131
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
forward to that

132
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
day for a

133
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
remission of

134
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
their sins, I

135
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
say unto

136
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
you, that these

137
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
are his

138
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
seed, or they

139
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:22,
are the heirs of the kingdom of God.

140
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
12 For

141
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
these are they

142
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
whose sins

143
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
he has

144
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
borne; these

145
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
are they for

146
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
whom he has

147
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
died, to

148
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
redeem them

149
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
from their

150
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0


151
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
transgressions. And

152
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
now, are they

153
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:36,
not his seed?

154
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
13 Yea,

155
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
and are not

156
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
the

157
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
prophets, every

158
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
one that

159
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
has opened

160
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
his mouth

161
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
to

162
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
prophesy, that

163
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
has not

164
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
fallen into

165
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0


166
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
transgression, I mean

167
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
all the

168
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
holy

169
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
prophets ever

170
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
since the

171
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
world began?

172
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
I say unto

173
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:22,
you that they are his seed.

174
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
14 And

175
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
these are

176
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
they who

177
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
have

178
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
published

179
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
peace, who

180
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
have

181
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
brought good

182
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
tidings of

183
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
good, who

184
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
have

185
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
published

186
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
salvation;

187
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
and said

188
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
unto

189
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:36,
Zion: Thy God reigneth!

190
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
15 And O

191
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
how

192

195
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
mountains were

196
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:22,
their feet!

197
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
16 And

198

00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
mountains

204
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
are the

00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
feet of

00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
those

207
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0
that are

208
00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:22,0

00:25:22,0 --> 00:25:36,
publishing peace!

210
00:25:36,0 --> 00:25:36,0
17 And
