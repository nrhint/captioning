00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,167
Chapter 15 How Christ is both the Father and the

2
00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:02,334
 Son—He will make intercession and bear the

3
00:00:02,334 --> 00:00:03,501
 transgressions of His people—They and all the holy

4
00:00:03,501 --> 00:00:04,668
 prophets are His seed—He brings to pass the

5
00:00:04,668 --> 00:00:05,835
 Resurrection—Little children have eternal life. About 148 B.C.

6
00:00:05,835 --> 00:00:07,002


7
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,975
1 And now Abinadi said unto them: I would that ye

8
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:11,975
 should understand that God himself shall come down

9
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:13,975
 among the children of men, and shall redeem his

10
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:15,975
 people

11
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,949
2 And because he dwelleth in flesh he shall be

12
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:19,949
 called the Son of God, and having subjected the flesh

13
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:21,949
 to the will of the Father, being the Father and

14
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:23,949
 the Son

15
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:26,591
3 The Father, because he was conceived by the

16
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:29,258
 power of God; and the Son, because of the flesh; thus

17
00:00:29,258 --> 00:00:31,925
 becoming the Father and Son

18
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:35,899
4 And they are one God, yea, the very Eternal

19
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:39,899
 Father of heaven and of earth

20
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,473
5 And thus the flesh becoming subject to the

21
00:00:41,473 --> 00:00:43,073
 Spirit, or the Son to the Father, being one God,

22
00:00:43,073 --> 00:00:44,673
 suffereth temptation, and yieldeth not to the

23
00:00:44,673 --> 00:00:46,273
 temptation, but suffereth himself to be mocked, and

24
00:00:46,273 --> 00:00:47,873
 scourged, and cast out, and disowned by his people

25
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,848
6 And after all this, after working many mighty

26
00:00:49,848 --> 00:00:51,848
 miracles among the children of men, he shall be led,

27
00:00:51,848 --> 00:00:53,848
 yea, even as Isaiah said, as a sheep before the

28
00:00:53,848 --> 00:00:55,848
 shearer is dumb, so he opened not his mouth

29
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:59,822
7 Yea, even so he shall be led, crucified, and

30
00:00:59,822 --> 00:01:03,822
 slain, the flesh becoming subject even unto death,

31
00:01:03,822 --> 00:01:07,822
 the will of the Son being swallowed up in the will

32
00:01:07,822 --> 00:01:11,822
 of the Father

33
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:17,105
8 And thus God breaketh the bands of death, having

34
00:01:17,105 --> 00:01:22,438
 gained the victory over death; giving the Son

35
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:27,771
 power to make intercession for the children of men

36
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:38,007
9 Having ascended into heaven, having the bowels

37
00:01:38,007 --> 00:01:48,293
 of mercy; being filled with compassion towards the

38
00:01:48,293 --> 00:01:58,579
 children of men; standing betwixt them and

39
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:08,865
 justice; having broken the bands of death, taken upon

40
00:02:08,865 --> 00:02:19,151
 himself their iniquity and their transgressions,

41
00:02:19,151 --> 00:02:29,437
 having redeemed them, and satisfied the demands of

42
00:02:29,437 --> 00:02:39,723
 justice

43
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:42,693
10 And now I say unto you, who shall declare his

44
00:02:42,693 --> 00:02:45,893
 generation? Behold, I say unto you, that when his

45
00:02:45,893 --> 00:02:49,093
 soul has been made an offering for sin he shall see

46
00:02:49,093 --> 00:02:52,293
 his seed. And now what say ye? And who shall be

47
00:02:52,293 --> 00:02:55,493
 his seed

48
00:02:55,442 --> 00:03:05,22
11 Behold I say unto you, that whosoever has heard

49
00:03:05,22 --> 00:03:14,998
 the words of the prophets, yea, all the holy

50
00:03:14,998 --> 00:03:24,776
 prophets who have prophesied concerning the coming of

51
00:03:24,776 --> 00:03:34,554
 the Lord—I say unto you, that all those who have

52
00:03:34,554 --> 00:03:44,332
 hearkened unto their words, and believed that the

53
00:03:44,332 --> 00:03:54,11
 Lord would redeem his people, and have looked

54
00:03:54,11 --> 00:04:03,888
 forward to that day for a remission of their sins, I

55
00:04:03,888 --> 00:04:13,666
 say unto you, that these are his seed, or they are

56
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:23,444
 the heirs of the kingdom of God

57
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:29,163
12 For these are they whose sins he has borne;

58
00:04:29,163 --> 00:04:35,163
 these are they for whom he has died, to redeem them

59
00:04:35,163 --> 00:04:41,163
 from their transgressions. And now, are they not

60
00:04:41,163 --> 00:04:47,163
 his seed

61
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:48,687
13 Yea, and are not the prophets, every one that

62
00:04:48,687 --> 00:04:50,287
 has opened his mouth to prophesy, that has not

63
00:04:50,287 --> 00:04:51,887
 fallen into transgression, I mean all the holy

64
00:04:51,887 --> 00:04:53,487
 prophets ever since the world began? I say unto you that

65
00:04:53,487 --> 00:04:55,087
 they are his seed

66
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:59,061
14 And these are they who have published peace,

67
00:04:59,061 --> 00:05:03,061
 who have brought good tidings of good, who have

68
00:05:03,061 --> 00:05:07,061
 published salvation; and said unto Zion: Thy God

69
00:05:07,061 --> 00:05:11,061
 reigneth

70
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:14,511
15 And O how beautiful upon the mountains were

71
00:05:14,511 --> 00:05:18,011
 their feet

72
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,652
16 And again, how beautiful upon the mountains are

73
00:05:20,652 --> 00:05:22,319
 the feet of those that are still publishing

74
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:23,986
 peace

75
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:30,69
17 And again, how beautiful upon the mountains are

76
00:05:30,69 --> 00:05:38,357
 the feet of those who shall hereafter publish

77
00:05:38,357 --> 00:05:46,024
 peace, yea, from this time henceforth and forever

78
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:48,28
18 And behold, I say unto you, this is not all.

79
00:05:48,28 --> 00:05:49,613
 For O how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet

80
00:05:49,613 --> 00:05:50,946
 of him that bringeth good tidings, that is the

81
00:05:50,946 --> 00:05:52,279
 founder of peace, yea, even the Lord, who has

82
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,612
 redeemed his people; yea, him who has granted salvation

83
00:05:53,612 --> 00:05:54,945
 unto his people

84
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,921
19 For were it not for the redemption which he

85
00:05:56,921 --> 00:05:58,921
 hath made for his people, which was prepared from the

86
00:05:58,921 --> 00:06:00,921
 foundation of the world, I say unto you, were it

87
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:02,921
 not for this, all mankind must have perished

88
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:04,896
20 But behold, the bands of death shall be broken,

89
00:06:04,896 --> 00:06:06,896
 and the Son reigneth, and hath power over the

90
00:06:06,896 --> 00:06:08,896
 dead; therefore, he bringeth to pass the resurrection

91
00:06:08,896 --> 00:06:10,896
 of the dead

92
00:06:10,87 --> 00:06:12,471
21 And there cometh a resurrection, even a first

93
00:06:12,471 --> 00:06:14,07
 resurrection; yea, even a resurrection of those

94
00:06:14,07 --> 00:06:15,671
 that have been, and who are, and who shall be, even

95
00:06:15,671 --> 00:06:17,27
 until the resurrection of Christ—for so shall he be

96
00:06:17,27 --> 00:06:18,87
 called

97
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:20,445
22 And now, the resurrection of all the prophets,

98
00:06:20,445 --> 00:06:22,045
 and all those that have believed in their words,

99
00:06:22,045 --> 00:06:23,645
 or all those that have kept the commandments of

100
00:06:23,645 --> 00:06:25,245
 God, shall come forth in the first resurrection;

101
00:06:25,245 --> 00:06:26,845
 therefore, they are the first resurrection

102
00:06:26,82 --> 00:06:29,487
23 They are raised to dwell with God who has

103
00:06:29,487 --> 00:06:32,154
 redeemed them; thus they have eternal life through

104
00:06:32,154 --> 00:06:34,821
 Christ, who has broken the bands of death

105
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:35,937
24 And these are those who have part in the first

106
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,08
 resurrection; and these are they that have died

107
00:06:37,08 --> 00:06:38,223
 before Christ came, in their ignorance, not having

108
00:06:38,223 --> 00:06:39,366
 salvation declared unto them. And thus the Lord

109
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:40,509
 bringeth about the restoration of these; and they

110
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:41,652
 have a part in the first resurrection, or have

111
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:42,795
 eternal life, being redeemed by the Lord

112
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:50,769
25 And little children also have eternal life

113
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:51,633
26 But behold, and fear, and tremble before God,

114
00:06:51,633 --> 00:06:52,522
 for ye ought to tremble; for the Lord redeemeth

115
00:06:52,522 --> 00:06:53,411
 none such that rebel against him and die in their

116
00:06:53,411 --> 00:06:54,3
 sins; yea, even all those that have perished in their

117
00:06:54,3 --> 00:06:55,189
 sins ever since the world began, that have

118
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:56,078
 wilfully rebelled against God, that have known the

119
00:06:56,078 --> 00:06:56,967
 commandments of God, and would not keep them; these are

120
00:06:56,967 --> 00:06:57,856
 they that have no part in the first resurrection

121
00:06:57,856 --> 00:06:58,745


122
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:00,318
27 Therefore ought ye not to tremble? For

123
00:07:00,318 --> 00:07:01,918
 salvation cometh to none such; for the Lord hath redeemed

124
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:03,518
 none such; yea, neither can the Lord redeem such;

125
00:07:03,518 --> 00:07:05,118
 for he cannot deny himself; for he cannot deny

126
00:07:05,118 --> 00:07:06,718
 justice when it has its claim

127
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:09,36
28 And now I say unto you that the time shall come

128
00:07:09,36 --> 00:07:12,027
 that the salvation of the Lord shall be declared

129
00:07:12,027 --> 00:07:14,694
 to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people

130
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:18,668
29 Yea, Lord, thy watchmen shall lift up their

131
00:07:18,668 --> 00:07:22,668
 voice; with the voice together shall they sing; for

132
00:07:22,668 --> 00:07:26,668
 they shall see eye to eye, when the Lord shall

133
00:07:26,668 --> 00:07:30,668
 bring again Zion

134
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:38,617
30 Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste

135
00:07:38,617 --> 00:07:46,617
 places of Jerusalem; for the Lord hath comforted

136
00:07:46,617 --> 00:07:54,617
 his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem

137
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:54,874
31 The Lord hath made bare his holy arm in the

138
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:55,207
 eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the

139
00:07:55,207 --> 00:07:55,54
 earth shall see the salvation of our God.
