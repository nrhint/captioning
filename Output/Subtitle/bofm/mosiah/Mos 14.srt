00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,4
Chapter 14 Isaiah speaks messianically—The

2
00:00:01,4 --> 00:00:02,8
 Messiah’s humiliation and sufferings are set forth—He

3
00:00:02,8 --> 00:00:04,2
 makes His soul an offering for sin and makes

4
00:00:04,2 --> 00:00:05,6
 intercession for transgressors—Compare 
Isaiah 53. About

5
00:00:05,6 --> 00:00:07,0
 148 B.C.

6
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:10,642
1 Yea, even doth not Isaiah say: Who hath believed

7
00:00:10,642 --> 00:00:13,309
 our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord

8
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:15,976
 revealed

9
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,949
2 For he shall grow up before him as a tender

10
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:19,949
 plant, and as a root out of dry ground; he hath no

11
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:21,949
 form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him there

12
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:23,949
 is no beauty that we should desire him

13
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,924
3 He is despised and rejected of men; a man of

14
00:00:25,924 --> 00:00:27,924
 sorrows, and acquainted with grief; and we hid as it

15
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:29,924
 were our faces from him; he was despised, and we

16
00:00:29,924 --> 00:00:31,924
 esteemed him not

17
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:34,566
4 Surely he has borne our griefs, and carried our

18
00:00:34,566 --> 00:00:37,233
 sorrows; yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten

19
00:00:37,233 --> 00:00:39,9
 of God, and afflicted

20
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,873
5 But he was wounded for our transgressions, he

21
00:00:41,873 --> 00:00:43,873
 was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of

22
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:45,873
 our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we

23
00:00:45,873 --> 00:00:47,873
 are healed

24
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:55,848
6 All we, like sheep, have gone astray; we have

25
00:00:55,848 --> 00:01:03,848
 turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath

26
00:01:03,848 --> 00:01:11,848
 laid on him the iniquities of us all

27
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:15,772
7 He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he

28
00:01:15,772 --> 00:01:19,772
 opened not his mouth; he is brought as a lamb to

29
00:01:19,772 --> 00:01:23,772
 the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is

30
00:01:23,772 --> 00:01:27,772
 dumb so he opened not his mouth

31
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:33,721
8 He was taken from prison and from judgment; and

32
00:01:33,721 --> 00:01:39,721
 who shall declare his generation? For he was cut

33
00:01:39,721 --> 00:01:45,721
 off out of the land of the living; for the

34
00:01:45,721 --> 00:01:51,721
 transgressions of my people was he stricken

35
00:01:51,645 --> 00:02:28,978
9 And he made his grave with the wicked, and with

36
00:02:28,978 --> 00:03:06,311
 the rich in his death; because he had done no

37
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:43,644
 evil, neither was any deceit in his mouth

38
00:03:43,29 --> 00:03:48,09
10 Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath

39
00:03:48,09 --> 00:03:52,89
 put him to grief; when thou shalt make his soul an

40
00:03:52,89 --> 00:03:57,69
 offering for sin he shall see his seed, he shall

41
00:03:57,69 --> 00:04:02,49
 prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord

42
00:04:02,49 --> 00:04:07,29
 shall prosper in his hand

43
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:19,214
11 He shall see the travail of his soul, and shall

44
00:04:19,214 --> 00:04:31,214
 be satisfied; by his knowledge shall my righteous

45
00:04:31,214 --> 00:04:43,214
 servant justify many; for he shall bear their

46
00:04:43,214 --> 00:04:55,214
 iniquities

47
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,228
12 Therefore will I divide him a portion with the

48
00:04:56,228 --> 00:04:57,395
 great, and he shall divide the spoil with the

49
00:04:57,395 --> 00:04:58,562
 strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto

50
00:04:58,562 --> 00:04:59,729
 death; and he was numbered with the transgressors; and

51
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:00,896
 he bore the sins of many, and made intercession

52
00:05:00,896 --> 00:05:02,063
 for the transgressors.
