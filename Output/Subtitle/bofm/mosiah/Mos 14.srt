00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,4
Chapter 14 Isaiah speaks

2
00:00:01,4 --> 00:00:02,8
messianically—The Messiah’s humiliation and sufferings

3
00:00:02,8 --> 00:00:04,2
are set forth—He makes His soul an offering

4
00:00:04,2 --> 00:00:05,6
for sin and makes intercession for

5
00:00:05,6 --> 00:00:07,508
transgressors—Compare 
Isaiah 53. About 148 B.C. 

6
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:09,508
1 Yea, even doth not Isaiah say:

7
00:00:09,508 --> 00:00:11,508
Who hath believed our report, and to

8
00:00:11,508 --> 00:00:13,847
whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?

9
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:13,68
2 For he shall grow up before

10
00:00:13,68 --> 00:00:13,513
him as a tender plant, and as a

11
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:13,346
root out of dry ground; he hath

12
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:13,179
no form nor comeliness; and

13
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:13,012
when we shall see him there is no

14
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:12,913
beauty that we should desire him.

15
00:00:12,913 --> 00:00:16,913
3 He is despised and

16
00:00:16,913 --> 00:00:20,913
rejected of men; a man of

17
00:00:20,913 --> 00:00:24,913
sorrows, and acquainted with

18
00:00:24,913 --> 00:00:28,913
grief; and we hid as it were our

19
00:00:28,913 --> 00:00:32,913
faces from him; he was

20
00:00:32,913 --> 00:00:36,37
despised, and we esteemed him not.

21
00:00:36,37 --> 00:00:39,77
4 Surely he has borne

22
00:00:39,77 --> 00:00:43,17
our griefs, and carried

23
00:00:43,17 --> 00:00:46,57
our sorrows; yet we did

24
00:00:46,57 --> 00:00:49,97
esteem him stricken,

25
00:00:49,97 --> 00:00:53,32
smitten of God, and afflicted.

26
00:00:53,32 --> 00:00:54,891
5 But he was wounded

27
00:00:54,891 --> 00:00:56,462
for our transgressions,

28
00:00:56,462 --> 00:00:58,033
he was bruised for

29
00:00:58,033 --> 00:00:59,604
our iniquities; the

30
00:00:59,604 --> 00:01:01,175
chastisement of our peace

31
00:01:01,175 --> 00:01:02,746
was upon him; and with

32
00:01:02,746 --> 00:01:04,298
his stripes we are healed.

33
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:05,298
6 All we, like

34
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:06,298
sheep, have gone

35
00:01:06,298 --> 00:01:07,298
astray; we have turned

36
00:01:07,298 --> 00:01:08,298
every one to his own

37
00:01:08,298 --> 00:01:09,298
way; and the Lord

38
00:01:09,298 --> 00:01:10,298
hath laid on him the

39
00:01:10,298 --> 00:01:11,338
iniquities of us all.

40
00:01:11,338 --> 00:01:11,438
7 He was

41
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:11,538
oppressed, and he was

42
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:11,638
afflicted, yet he

43
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:11,738
opened not his mouth;

44
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:11,838
he is brought as a

45
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:11,938
lamb to the

46
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:12,038
slaughter, and as a

47
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:12,138
sheep before her

48
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:12,238
shearers is dumb so he

49
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:12,339
opened not his mouth.

50
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:13,975
8 He was taken

51
00:01:13,975 --> 00:01:15,611
from prison and

52
00:01:15,611 --> 00:01:17,247
from judgment;

53
00:01:17,247 --> 00:01:18,883
and who shall

54
00:01:18,883 --> 00:01:20,519
declare his

55
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:22,155
generation? For he was

56
00:01:22,155 --> 00:01:23,791
cut off out of

57
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:25,427
the land of the

58
00:01:25,427 --> 00:01:27,063
living; for the

59
00:01:27,063 --> 00:01:28,699
transgressions of

60
00:01:28,699 --> 00:01:30,19
my people was he stricken.

61
00:01:30,19 --> 00:01:32,079
9 And he made

62
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,968
his grave with

63
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:35,857
the wicked, and

64
00:01:35,857 --> 00:01:37,746
with the rich

65
00:01:37,746 --> 00:01:39,635
in his death;

66
00:01:39,635 --> 00:01:41,524
because he had

67
00:01:41,524 --> 00:01:43,413
done no evil,

68
00:01:43,413 --> 00:01:45,302
neither was any

69
00:01:45,302 --> 00:01:47,107
deceit in his mouth.

70
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,907
10 Yet it

71
00:01:48,907 --> 00:01:50,707
pleased the Lord

72
00:01:50,707 --> 00:01:52,507
to bruise him;

73
00:01:52,507 --> 00:01:54,307
he hath put

74
00:01:54,307 --> 00:01:56,107
him to grief;

75
00:01:56,107 --> 00:01:57,907
when thou shalt

76
00:01:57,907 --> 00:01:59,707
make his soul

77
00:01:59,707 --> 00:02:01,507
an offering

78
00:02:01,507 --> 00:02:03,307
for sin he shall

79
00:02:03,307 --> 00:02:05,107
see his seed,

80
00:02:05,107 --> 00:02:06,907
he shall

81
00:02:06,907 --> 00:02:08,707
prolong his days,

82
00:02:08,707 --> 00:02:10,507
and the

83
00:02:10,507 --> 00:02:12,307
pleasure of the Lord

84
00:02:12,307 --> 00:02:14,968
shall prosper in his hand.

85
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:15,635
11 He shall

86
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:16,302
see the

87
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:16,969
travail of his

88
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:17,636
soul, and shall

89
00:02:17,636 --> 00:02:18,303
be satisfied;

90
00:02:18,303 --> 00:02:18,97
by his

91
00:02:18,97 --> 00:02:19,637
knowledge shall my

92
00:02:19,637 --> 00:02:20,304
righteous

93
00:02:20,304 --> 00:02:20,971
servant justify

94
00:02:20,971 --> 00:02:21,638
many; for he

95
00:02:21,638 --> 00:02:22,305
shall bear

96
00:02:22,305 --> 00:02:22,943
their iniquities.

97
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:22,943
12 Therefore

98
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:22,943
will I

99
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:22,943
divide him a

100
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:22,943
portion with

101
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:22,943
the great, and

102
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:22,943
he shall

103
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:22,943
divide the

104
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:22,943
spoil with the

105
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:22,943
strong;

106
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:22,943
because he hath

107
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:22,943
poured out

108
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:22,943
his soul unto

109
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:22,943
death; and

110
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:22,943
he was

111
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:22,943
numbered with the

112
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:22,943


113
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:22,943
transgressors; and he

114
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:22,943
bore the sins

115
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:22,943
of many,

116
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:22,943
and made

117
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:22,009
intercession for the transgressors.
