00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 14 Isaiah speaks

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
messianically—The Messiah’s humiliation and sufferings

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
are set forth—He makes His soul an offering

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
for sin and makes intercession for

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:15:55,
transgressors—Compare 
Isaiah 53. About 148 B.C. 

6
00:15:55,0 --> 00:15:55,0
1 Yea, even doth not Isaiah say:

7
00:15:55,0 --> 00:15:55,0
Who hath believed our report, and to

8
00:15:55,0 --> 00:25:23,
whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?

9
00:25:23,0 --> 00:25:23,0
2 For he shall grow up before

10
00:25:23,0 --> 00:25:23,0
him as a tender plant, and as a

11
00:25:23,0 --> 00:25:23,0
root out of dry ground; he hath

12
00:25:23,0 --> 00:25:23,0
no form nor comeliness; and

13
00:25:23,0 --> 00:25:23,0
when we shall see him there is no

14
00:25:23,0 --> 00:24:55,
beauty that we should desire him.

15
00:24:55,0 --> 00:24:55,0
3 He is despised and

16
00:24:55,0 --> 00:24:55,0
rejected of men; a man of

17
00:24:55,0 --> 00:24:55,0
sorrows, and acquainted with

18
00:24:55,0 --> 00:24:55,0
grief; and we hid as it were our

19
00:24:55,0 --> 00:24:55,0
faces from him; he was

20
00:24:55,0 --> 00:24:27,
despised, and we esteemed him not.

21
00:24:27,0 --> 00:24:27,0
4 Surely he has borne

22
00:24:27,0 --> 00:24:27,0
our griefs, and carried

23
00:24:27,0 --> 00:24:27,0
our sorrows; yet we did

24
00:24:27,0 --> 00:24:27,0
esteem him stricken,

25
00:24:27,0 --> 00:23:59,
smitten of God, and afflicted.

26
00:23:59,0 --> 00:23:59,0
5 But he was wounded

27
00:23:59,0 --> 00:23:59,0
for our transgressions,

28
00:23:59,0 --> 00:23:59,0
he was bruised for

29
00:23:59,0 --> 00:23:59,0
our iniquities; the

30
00:23:59,0 --> 00:23:59,0
chastisement of our peace

31
00:23:59,0 --> 00:23:59,0
was upon him; and with

32
00:23:59,0 --> 00:24:57,
his stripes we are healed.

33
00:24:57,0 --> 00:24:57,0
6 All we, like

34
00:24:57,0 --> 00:24:57,0
sheep, have gone

35
00:24:57,0 --> 00:24:57,0
astray; we have turned

36
00:24:57,0 --> 00:24:57,0
every one to his own

37
00:24:57,0 --> 00:24:57,0
way; and the Lord

38
00:24:57,0 --> 00:24:57,0
hath laid on him the

39
00:24:57,0 --> 00:25:11,
iniquities of us all.

40
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
7 He was

41
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
oppressed, and he was

42
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
afflicted, yet he

43
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
opened not his mouth;

44
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
he is brought as a

45
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
lamb to the

46
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
slaughter, and as a

47
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
sheep before her

48
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
shearers is dumb so he

49
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,
opened not his mouth.

50
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
8 He was taken

51
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
from prison and

52
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
from judgment;

53
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
and who shall

54
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
declare his

55
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
generation? For he was

56
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
cut off out of

57
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
the land of the

58
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
living; for the

59
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
transgressions of

60
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,
my people was he stricken.

61
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
9 And he made

62
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
his grave with

63
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
the wicked, and

64
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
with the rich

65
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
in his death;

66
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
because he had

67
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
done no evil,

68
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
neither was any

69
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,
deceit in his mouth.

70
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
10 Yet it

71
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
pleased the Lord

72
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
to bruise him;

73
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
he hath put

74
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
him to grief;

75
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
when thou shalt

76
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
make his soul

77
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
an offering

78
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
for sin he shall

79
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
see his seed,

80
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
he shall

81
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
prolong his days,

82
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
and the

83
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
pleasure of the Lord

84
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,
shall prosper in his hand.

85
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
11 He shall

86
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
see the

87
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
travail of his

88
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
soul, and shall

89
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
be satisfied;

90
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
by his

91
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
knowledge shall my

92
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
righteous

93
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
servant justify

94
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
many; for he

95
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
shall bear

96
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,
their iniquities.

97
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
12 Therefore

98
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
will I

99
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
divide him a

100
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
portion with

101
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
the great, and

102
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
he shall

103
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
divide the

104
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
spoil with the

105
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
strong;

106
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
because he hath

107
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
poured out

108
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
his soul unto

109
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
death; and

110
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
he was

111
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
numbered with the

112
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0


113
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
transgressors; and he

114
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
bore the sins

115
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
of many,

116
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,0
and made

117
00:25:11,0 --> 00:25:11,
intercession for the transgressors.
