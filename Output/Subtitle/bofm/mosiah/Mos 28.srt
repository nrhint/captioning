1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 28 The sons of Mosiah go to preach to

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Lamanites—Using the two seer stones,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:06:27,
Mosiah translates the Jaredite plates. About 92 B.C. 

4
00:06:27,0 --> 00:06:27,0
1 Now it came to pass that after the sons of

5
00:06:27,0 --> 00:06:27,0
Mosiah had done all these things, they took a

6
00:06:27,0 --> 00:06:27,0
small number with them and returned to their

7
00:06:27,0 --> 00:06:27,0
father, the king, and desired of him that he

8
00:06:27,0 --> 00:06:27,0
would grant unto them that they might, with these

9
00:06:27,0 --> 00:06:27,0
whom they had selected, go up to the land of

10
00:06:27,0 --> 00:06:27,0
Nephi that they might preach the things which

11
00:06:27,0 --> 00:06:27,0
they had heard, and that they might impart the

12
00:06:27,0 --> 00:10:26,
word of God to their brethren, the Lamanites—

13
00:10:26,0 --> 00:10:26,0
2 That perhaps they might bring them to

14
00:10:26,0 --> 00:10:26,0
the knowledge of the Lord their God, and

15
00:10:26,0 --> 00:10:26,0
convince them of the iniquity of their

16
00:10:26,0 --> 00:10:26,0
fathers; and that perhaps they might cure them

17
00:10:26,0 --> 00:10:26,0
of their hatred towards the Nephites, that

18
00:10:26,0 --> 00:10:26,0
they might also be brought to rejoice in

19
00:10:26,0 --> 00:10:26,0
the Lord their God, that they might become

20
00:10:26,0 --> 00:10:26,0
friendly to one another, and that there

21
00:10:26,0 --> 00:10:26,0
should be no more contentions in all the

22
00:10:26,0 --> 00:14:11,
land which the Lord their God had given them.

23
00:14:11,0 --> 00:14:11,0
3 Now they were desirous that salvation

24
00:14:11,0 --> 00:14:11,0
should be declared to every creature,

25
00:14:11,0 --> 00:14:11,0
for they could not bear that any human

26
00:14:11,0 --> 00:14:11,0
soul should perish; yea, even the very

27
00:14:11,0 --> 00:14:11,0
thoughts that any soul should endure endless

28
00:14:11,0 --> 00:16:23,
torment did cause them to quake and tremble.

29
00:16:23,0 --> 00:16:23,0
4 And thus did the Spirit of the

30
00:16:23,0 --> 00:16:23,0
Lord work upon them, for they were the

31
00:16:23,0 --> 00:16:23,0
very vilest of sinners. And the Lord

32
00:16:23,0 --> 00:16:23,0
saw fit in his infinite mercy to

33
00:16:23,0 --> 00:16:23,0
spare them; nevertheless they suffered

34
00:16:23,0 --> 00:16:23,0
much anguish of soul because of

35
00:16:23,0 --> 00:16:23,0
their iniquities, suffering much and

36
00:16:23,0 --> 00:20:51,
fearing that they should be cast off forever.

37
00:20:51,0 --> 00:20:51,0
5 And it came to pass that

38
00:20:51,0 --> 00:20:51,0
they did plead with their

39
00:20:51,0 --> 00:20:51,0
father many days that they

40
00:20:51,0 --> 00:23:03,
might go up to the land of Nephi.

41
00:23:03,0 --> 00:23:03,0
6 And king Mosiah went

42
00:23:03,0 --> 00:23:03,0
and inquired of the

43
00:23:03,0 --> 00:23:03,0
Lord if he should let his

44
00:23:03,0 --> 00:23:03,0
sons go up among the

45
00:23:03,0 --> 00:30:47,
Lamanites to preach the word.

46
00:30:47,0 --> 00:30:47,0
7 And the Lord said

47
00:30:47,0 --> 00:30:47,0
unto Mosiah: Let them go

48
00:30:47,0 --> 00:30:47,0
up, for many shall

49
00:30:47,0 --> 00:30:47,0
believe on their words, and

50
00:30:47,0 --> 00:30:47,0
they shall have eternal

51
00:30:47,0 --> 00:30:47,0
life; and I will

52
00:30:47,0 --> 00:30:47,0
deliver thy sons out of the

53
00:30:47,0 --> 00:30:19,
hands of the Lamanites.

54
00:30:19,0 --> 00:30:19,0
8 And it came to

55
00:30:19,0 --> 00:30:19,0
pass that Mosiah

56
00:30:19,0 --> 00:30:19,0
granted that they might

57
00:30:19,0 --> 00:30:19,0
go and do

58
00:30:19,0 --> 00:30:33,
according to their request.

59
00:30:33,0 --> 00:30:33,0
9 And they took

60
00:30:33,0 --> 00:30:33,0
their journey into

61
00:30:33,0 --> 00:30:33,0
the wilderness

62
00:30:33,0 --> 00:30:33,0
to go up to preach

63
00:30:33,0 --> 00:30:33,0
the word among

64
00:30:33,0 --> 00:30:33,0
the Lamanites; and

65
00:30:33,0 --> 00:30:33,0
I shall give an

66
00:30:33,0 --> 00:30:33,0
account of their

67
00:30:33,0 --> 00:37:41,
proceedings hereafter.

68
00:37:41,0 --> 00:37:41,0
10 Now king

69
00:37:41,0 --> 00:37:41,0
Mosiah had no one

70
00:37:41,0 --> 00:37:41,0
to confer the

71
00:37:41,0 --> 00:37:41,0
kingdom upon,

72
00:37:41,0 --> 00:37:41,0
for there was not

73
00:37:41,0 --> 00:37:41,0
any of his

74
00:37:41,0 --> 00:37:41,0
sons who would

75
00:37:41,0 --> 00:38:39,
accept of the kingdom.

76
00:38:39,0 --> 00:38:39,0
11 Therefore

77
00:38:39,0 --> 00:38:39,0
he took the

78
00:38:39,0 --> 00:38:39,0
records which

79
00:38:39,0 --> 00:38:39,0
were engraven on

80
00:38:39,0 --> 00:38:39,0
the plates of

81
00:38:39,0 --> 00:38:39,0
brass, and

82
00:38:39,0 --> 00:38:39,0
also the plates

83
00:38:39,0 --> 00:38:39,0
of Nephi, and

84
00:38:39,0 --> 00:38:39,0
all the things

85
00:38:39,0 --> 00:38:39,0
which he had

86
00:38:39,0 --> 00:38:39,0
kept and

87
00:38:39,0 --> 00:38:39,0
preserved according

88
00:38:39,0 --> 00:38:39,0
to the

89
00:38:39,0 --> 00:38:39,0
commandments of God,

90
00:38:39,0 --> 00:38:39,0
after having

91
00:38:39,0 --> 00:38:39,0
translated and

92
00:38:39,0 --> 00:38:39,0
caused to be

93
00:38:39,0 --> 00:38:39,0
written the

94
00:38:39,0 --> 00:38:39,0
records which

95
00:38:39,0 --> 00:38:39,0
were on the

96
00:38:39,0 --> 00:38:39,0
plates of gold

97
00:38:39,0 --> 00:38:39,0
which had been

98
00:38:39,0 --> 00:38:39,0
found by the

99
00:38:39,0 --> 00:38:39,0
people of Limhi,

100
00:38:39,0 --> 00:38:39,0
which were

101
00:38:39,0 --> 00:40:09,
delivered to him by the hand of Limhi;

102
00:40:09,0 --> 00:40:09,0
12 And this

103
00:40:09,0 --> 00:40:09,0
he did because

104
00:40:09,0 --> 00:40:09,0
of the great

105
00:40:09,0 --> 00:40:09,0
anxiety of

106
00:40:09,0 --> 00:40:09,0
his people;

107
00:40:09,0 --> 00:40:09,0
for they were

108
00:40:09,0 --> 00:40:09,0
desirous

109
00:40:09,0 --> 00:40:09,0
beyond measure to

110
00:40:09,0 --> 00:40:09,0
know

111
00:40:09,0 --> 00:40:09,0
concerning those

112
00:40:09,0 --> 00:40:09,0
people who had

113
00:40:09,0 --> 00:46:35,
been destroyed.

114
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
13 And now

115
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
he translated

116
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
them by the

117
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
means of

118
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
those two

119
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
stones which

120
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
were fastened

121
00:46:35,0 --> 00:46:35,0
into the two

122
00:46:35,0 --> 00:57:28,
rims of a bow.

123
00:57:28,0 --> 00:57:28,0
14 Now

124
00:57:28,0 --> 00:57:28,0
these things

125
00:57:28,0 --> 00:57:28,0
were prepared

126
00:57:28,0 --> 00:57:28,0
from the

127
00:57:28,0 --> 00:57:28,0
beginning,

128
00:57:28,0 --> 00:57:28,0
and were

129
00:57:28,0 --> 00:57:28,0
handed down

130
00:57:28,0 --> 00:57:28,0
from

131
00:57:28,0 --> 00:57:28,0
generation to

132
00:57:28,0 --> 00:57:28,0
generation, for

133
00:57:28,0 --> 00:57:28,0
the purpose

134
00:57:28,0 --> 00:57:28,0
of

135
00:57:28,0 --> 01:04:23,
interpreting languages;

136
01:04:23,0 --> 01:04:23,0
15 And

137
01:04:23,0 --> 01:04:23,0
they have

138
01:04:23,0 --> 01:04:23,0
been kept and

139
01:04:23,0 --> 01:04:23,0
preserved

140
01:04:23,0 --> 01:04:23,0
by the

141
01:04:23,0 --> 01:04:23,0
hand of the

142
01:04:23,0 --> 01:04:23,0
Lord, that

143
01:04:23,0 --> 01:04:23,0
he should

144
01:04:23,0 --> 01:04:23,0
discover

145
01:04:23,0 --> 01:04:23,0
to every

146
01:04:23,0 --> 01:04:23,0
creature

147
01:04:23,0 --> 01:04:23,0
who should

148
01:04:23,0 --> 01:04:23,0
possess the

149
01:04:23,0 --> 01:04:23,0
land the

150
01:04:23,0 --> 01:04:23,0
iniquities

151
01:04:23,0 --> 01:04:23,0
and

152
01:04:23,0 --> 01:11:31,
abominations of his people;

153
01:11:31,0 --> 01:11:31,0
16 And

154
01:11:31,0 --> 01:11:31,0
whosoever has

155
01:11:31,0 --> 01:11:31,0
these

156
01:11:31,0 --> 01:11:31,0
things is

157
01:11:31,0 --> 01:11:31,0
called seer,

158
01:11:31,0 --> 01:11:31,0
after the

159
01:11:31,0 --> 01:11:31,0
manner of

160
01:11:31,0 --> 01:11:03,
old times.

161
01:11:03,0 --> 01:11:03,0
17 Now

162
01:11:03,0 --> 01:11:03,0
after

163
01:11:03,0 --> 01:11:03,0
Mosiah had

164
01:11:03,0 --> 01:11:03,0
finished

165
01:11:03,0 --> 01:11:03,0
translating

166
01:11:03,0 --> 01:11:03,0
these

167
01:11:03,0 --> 01:11:03,0
records,

168
01:11:03,0 --> 01:11:03,0
behold, it

169
01:11:03,0 --> 01:11:03,0
gave an

170
01:11:03,0 --> 01:11:03,0
account of

171
01:11:03,0 --> 01:11:03,0
the

172
01:11:03,0 --> 01:11:03,0
people who

173
01:11:03,0 --> 01:11:03,0
were

174
01:11:03,0 --> 01:11:03,0
destroyed, from

175
01:11:03,0 --> 01:11:03,0
the time

176
01:11:03,0 --> 01:11:03,0
that they

177
01:11:03,0 --> 01:11:03,0
were

178
01:11:03,0 --> 01:11:03,0
destroyed

179
01:11:03,0 --> 01:11:03,0
back to the

180
01:11:03,0 --> 01:11:03,0
building

181
01:11:03,0 --> 01:11:03,0
of the

182
01:11:03,0 --> 01:11:03,0
great

183
01:11:03,0 --> 01:11:03,0
tower, at the

184
01:11:03,0 --> 01:11:03,0
time the

185
01:11:03,0 --> 01:11:03,0
Lord

186
01:11:03,0 --> 01:11:03,0
confounded

187
01:11:03,0 --> 01:11:03,0
the

188
01:11:03,0 --> 01:11:03,0
language of the

189
01:11:03,0 --> 01:11:03,0
people

190
01:11:03,0 --> 01:11:03,0
and they

191
01:11:03,0 --> 01:11:03,0
were

192
01:11:03,0 --> 01:11:03,0
scattered

193
01:11:03,0 --> 01:11:03,0
abroad upon

194
01:11:03,0 --> 01:11:03,0
the face

195
01:11:03,0 --> 01:11:03,0
of all the

196
01:11:03,0 --> 01:11:03,0
earth,

197
01:11:03,0 --> 01:11:03,0
yea, and

198
01:11:03,0 --> 01:11:03,0
even from

199
01:11:03,0 --> 01:22:46,
that time back until the creation of Adam.

200
01:22:46,0 --> 01:22:46,0
18 Now

201
01:22:46,0 --> 01:22:46,0
this

202
01:22:46,0 --> 01:22:46,0
account did

203
01:22:46,0 --> 01:22:46,0
cause the

204
01:22:46,0 --> 01:22:46,0
people of

205
01:22:46,0 --> 01:22:46,0
Mosiah to

206
01:22:46,0 --> 01:22:46,0
mourn

207
01:22:46,0 --> 01:22:46,0
exceedingly,

208
01:22:46,0 --> 01:22:46,0
yea,

209
01:22:46,0 --> 01:22:46,0
they were

210
01:22:46,0 --> 01:22:46,0
filled with

211
01:22:46,0 --> 01:22:46,0
sorrow;

212
01:22:46,0 --> 01:22:46,0


213
01:22:46,0 --> 01:22:46,0
nevertheless it

214
01:22:46,0 --> 01:22:46,0
gave them

215
01:22:46,0 --> 01:22:46,0
much

216
01:22:46,0 --> 01:22:46,0
knowledge, in

217
01:22:46,0 --> 01:22:46,0
the which

218
01:22:46,0 --> 01:22:46,0
they did

219
01:22:46,0 --> 01:24:30,
rejoice.

220
01:24:30,0 --> 01:24:30,0
19 And

221
01:24:30,0 --> 01:24:30,0
this

222
01:24:30,0 --> 01:24:30,0
account

223
01:24:30,0 --> 01:24:30,0
shall be

224
01:24:30,0 --> 01:24:30,0
written

225
01:24:30,0 --> 01:24:30,0
