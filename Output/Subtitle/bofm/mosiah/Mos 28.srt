00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:07,0
Chapter 28 The sons of Mosiah go to preach to

2
00:00:07,0 --> 00:00:14,0
the Lamanites—Using the two seer stones,

3
00:00:14,0 --> 00:00:21,321
Mosiah translates the Jaredite plates. About 92 B.C. 

4
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:22,321
1 Now it came to pass that after the sons of

5
00:00:22,321 --> 00:00:23,321
Mosiah had done all these things, they took a

6
00:00:23,321 --> 00:00:24,321
small number with them and returned to their

7
00:00:24,321 --> 00:00:25,321
father, the king, and desired of him that he

8
00:00:25,321 --> 00:00:26,321
would grant unto them that they might, with these

9
00:00:26,321 --> 00:00:27,321
whom they had selected, go up to the land of

10
00:00:27,321 --> 00:00:28,321
Nephi that they might preach the things which

11
00:00:28,321 --> 00:00:29,321
they had heard, and that they might impart the

12
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:30,764
word of God to their brethren, the Lamanites—

13
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:32,264
2 That perhaps they might bring them to

14
00:00:32,264 --> 00:00:33,764
the knowledge of the Lord their God, and

15
00:00:33,764 --> 00:00:35,264
convince them of the iniquity of their

16
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:36,764
fathers; and that perhaps they might cure them

17
00:00:36,764 --> 00:00:38,264
of their hatred towards the Nephites, that

18
00:00:38,264 --> 00:00:39,764
they might also be brought to rejoice in

19
00:00:39,764 --> 00:00:41,264
the Lord their God, that they might become

20
00:00:41,264 --> 00:00:42,764
friendly to one another, and that there

21
00:00:42,764 --> 00:00:44,264
should be no more contentions in all the

22
00:00:44,264 --> 00:00:45,746
land which the Lord their God had given them.

23
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:51,413
3 Now they were desirous that salvation

24
00:00:51,413 --> 00:00:57,08
should be declared to every creature,

25
00:00:57,08 --> 00:01:02,747
for they could not bear that any human

26
00:01:02,747 --> 00:01:08,414
soul should perish; yea, even the very

27
00:01:08,414 --> 00:01:14,081
thoughts that any soul should endure endless

28
00:01:14,081 --> 00:01:19,112
torment did cause them to quake and tremble.

29
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:19,487
4 And thus did the Spirit of the

30
00:01:19,487 --> 00:01:19,862
Lord work upon them, for they were the

31
00:01:19,862 --> 00:01:20,237
very vilest of sinners. And the Lord

32
00:01:20,237 --> 00:01:20,612
saw fit in his infinite mercy to

33
00:01:20,612 --> 00:01:20,987
spare them; nevertheless they suffered

34
00:01:20,987 --> 00:01:21,362
much anguish of soul because of

35
00:01:21,362 --> 00:01:21,737
their iniquities, suffering much and

36
00:01:21,737 --> 00:01:22,582
fearing that they should be cast off forever.

37
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:26,832
5 And it came to pass that

38
00:01:26,832 --> 00:01:31,082
they did plead with their

39
00:01:31,082 --> 00:01:35,332
father many days that they

40
00:01:35,332 --> 00:01:39,967
might go up to the land of Nephi.

41
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:49,167
6 And king Mosiah went

42
00:01:49,167 --> 00:01:58,367
and inquired of the

43
00:01:58,367 --> 00:02:07,567
Lord if he should let his

44
00:02:07,567 --> 00:02:16,767
sons go up among the

45
00:02:16,767 --> 00:02:25,679
Lamanites to preach the word.

46
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:27,054
7 And the Lord said

47
00:02:27,054 --> 00:02:28,429
unto Mosiah: Let them go

48
00:02:28,429 --> 00:02:29,804
up, for many shall

49
00:02:29,804 --> 00:02:31,179
believe on their words, and

50
00:02:31,179 --> 00:02:32,554
they shall have eternal

51
00:02:32,554 --> 00:02:33,929
life; and I will

52
00:02:33,929 --> 00:02:35,304
deliver thy sons out of the

53
00:02:35,304 --> 00:02:36,056
hands of the Lamanites.

54
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:37,656
8 And it came to

55
00:02:37,656 --> 00:02:39,256
pass that Mosiah

56
00:02:39,256 --> 00:02:40,856
granted that they might

57
00:02:40,856 --> 00:02:42,456
go and do

58
00:02:42,456 --> 00:02:44,998
according to their request.

59
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:44,998
9 And they took

60
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:44,998
their journey into

61
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:44,998
the wilderness

62
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:44,998
to go up to preach

63
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:44,998
the word among

64
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:44,998
the Lamanites; and

65
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:44,998
I shall give an

66
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:44,998
account of their

67
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:44,064
proceedings hereafter.

68
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:43,939
10 Now king

69
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:43,814
Mosiah had no one

70
00:02:43,814 --> 00:02:43,689
to confer the

71
00:02:43,689 --> 00:02:43,564
kingdom upon,

72
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:43,439
for there was not

73
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:43,314
any of his

74
00:02:43,314 --> 00:02:43,189
sons who would

75
00:02:43,189 --> 00:02:43,13
accept of the kingdom.

76
00:02:43,13 --> 00:02:43,092
11 Therefore

77
00:02:43,092 --> 00:02:43,054
he took the

78
00:02:43,054 --> 00:02:43,016
records which

79
00:02:43,016 --> 00:02:42,978
were engraven on

80
00:02:42,978 --> 00:02:42,94
the plates of

81
00:02:42,94 --> 00:02:42,902
brass, and

82
00:02:42,902 --> 00:02:42,864
also the plates

83
00:02:42,864 --> 00:02:42,826
of Nephi, and

84
00:02:42,826 --> 00:02:42,788
all the things

85
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:42,75
which he had

86
00:02:42,75 --> 00:02:42,712
kept and

87
00:02:42,712 --> 00:02:42,674
preserved according

88
00:02:42,674 --> 00:02:42,636
to the

89
00:02:42,636 --> 00:02:42,598
commandments of God,

90
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:42,56
after having

91
00:02:42,56 --> 00:02:42,522
translated and

92
00:02:42,522 --> 00:02:42,484
caused to be

93
00:02:42,484 --> 00:02:42,446
written the

94
00:02:42,446 --> 00:02:42,408
records which

95
00:02:42,408 --> 00:02:42,37
were on the

96
00:02:42,37 --> 00:02:42,332
plates of gold

97
00:02:42,332 --> 00:02:42,294
which had been

98
00:02:42,294 --> 00:02:42,256
found by the

99
00:02:42,256 --> 00:02:42,218
people of Limhi,

100
00:02:42,218 --> 00:02:42,18
which were

101
00:02:42,18 --> 00:02:42,662
delivered to him by the hand of Limhi;

102
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
12 And this

103
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
he did because

104
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
of the great

105
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
anxiety of

106
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
his people;

107
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
for they were

108
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
desirous

109
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
beyond measure to

110
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
know

111
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
concerning those

112
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
people who had

113
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
been destroyed.

114
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
13 And now

115
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
he translated

116
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
them by the

117
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
means of

118
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
those two

119
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
stones which

120
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
were fastened

121
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
into the two

122
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
rims of a bow.

123
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
14 Now

124
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
these things

125
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
were prepared

126
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
from the

127
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
beginning,

128
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
and were

129
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
handed down

130
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
from

131
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
generation to

132
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
generation, for

133
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
the purpose

134
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
of

135
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
interpreting languages;

136
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
15 And

137
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
they have

138
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
been kept and

139
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
preserved

140
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
by the

141
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
hand of the

142
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
Lord, that

143
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
he should

144
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
discover

145
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
to every

146
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
creature

147
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
who should

148
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
possess the

149
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
land the

150
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
iniquities

151
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
and

152
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
abominations of his people;

153
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
16 And

154
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
whosoever has

155
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
these

156
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
things is

157
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
called seer,

158
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
after the

159
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
manner of

160
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
old times.

161
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
17 Now

162
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
after

163
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
Mosiah had

164
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
finished

165
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
translating

166
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
these

167
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
records,

168
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
behold, it

169
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
gave an

170
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
account of

171
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
the

172
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
people who

173
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
were

174
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
destroyed, from

175
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
the time

176
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
that they

177
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
were

178
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
destroyed

179
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
back to the

180
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
building

181
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
of the

182
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
great

183
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
tower, at the

184
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
time the

185
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
Lord

186
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
confounded

187
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
the

188
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
language of the

189
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
people

190
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
and they

191
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
were

192
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
scattered

193
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
abroad upon

194
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
the face

195
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
of all the

196
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
earth,

197
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
yea, and

198
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
even from

199
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
that time back until the creation of Adam.

200
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
18 Now

201
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
this

202
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
account did

203
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
cause the

204
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
people of

205
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
Mosiah to

206
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
mourn

207
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
exceedingly,

208
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
yea,

209
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
they were

210
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
filled with

211
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
sorrow;

212
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662


213
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
nevertheless it

214
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
gave them

215
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
much

216
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
knowledge, in

217
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662

218
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
they did

219
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
rejoice.

220
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
19 And

221
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
this

222
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662

225
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
hereafter;

226
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
for

227
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662

228
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662

229
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
expedient that

230
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662

231
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662

232
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:42,662
