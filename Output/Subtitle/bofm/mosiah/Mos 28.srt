00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:02,333
Chapter 28 The sons of Mosiah go to preach to the

2
00:00:02,333 --> 00:00:04,666
 Lamanites—Using the two seer stones, Mosiah

3
00:00:04,666 --> 00:00:06,999
 translates the Jaredite plates. About 92 B.C.

4
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:08,864
1 Now it came to pass that after the sons of

5
00:00:08,864 --> 00:00:09,753
 Mosiah had done all these things, they took a small

6
00:00:09,753 --> 00:00:10,642
 number with them and returned to their father, the

7
00:00:10,642 --> 00:00:11,531
 king, and desired of him that he would grant unto

8
00:00:11,531 --> 00:00:12,42
 them that they might, with these whom they had

9
00:00:12,42 --> 00:00:13,309
 selected, go up to the land of Nephi that they might

10
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:14,198
 preach the things which they had heard, and that

11
00:00:14,198 --> 00:00:15,087
 they might impart the word of God to their brethren,

12
00:00:15,087 --> 00:00:15,976
 the Lamanites

13
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:16,838
2 That perhaps they might bring them to the

14
00:00:16,838 --> 00:00:17,727
 knowledge of the Lord their God, and convince them of

15
00:00:17,727 --> 00:00:18,616
 the iniquity of their fathers; and that perhaps they

16
00:00:18,616 --> 00:00:19,505
 might cure them of their hatred towards the

17
00:00:19,505 --> 00:00:20,394
 Nephites, that they might also be brought to rejoice in

18
00:00:20,394 --> 00:00:21,283
 the Lord their God, that they might become

19
00:00:21,283 --> 00:00:22,172
 friendly to one another, and that there should be no

20
00:00:22,172 --> 00:00:23,061
 more contentions in all the land which the Lord their

21
00:00:23,061 --> 00:00:23,95
 God had given them

22
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,524
3 Now they were desirous that salvation should be

23
00:00:25,524 --> 00:00:27,124
 declared to every creature, for they could not

24
00:00:27,124 --> 00:00:28,724
 bear that any human soul should perish; yea, even the

25
00:00:28,724 --> 00:00:30,324
 very thoughts that any soul should endure endless

26
00:00:30,324 --> 00:00:31,924
 torment did cause them to quake and tremble

27
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:34,566
4 And thus did the Spirit of the Lord work upon

28
00:00:34,566 --> 00:00:37,233
 them, for they were the very vilest of sinners. And

29
00:00:37,233 --> 00:00:39,9
 the Lord saw fit in his infinite mercy to spare

30
00:00:39,9 --> 00:00:42,567
 them; nevertheless they suffered much anguish of

31
00:00:42,567 --> 00:00:45,234
 soul because of their iniquities, suffering much and

32
00:00:45,234 --> 00:00:47,901
 fearing that they should be cast off forever

33
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:50,515
5 And it came to pass that they did plead with

34
00:00:50,515 --> 00:00:53,182
 their father many days that they might go up to the

35
00:00:53,182 --> 00:00:55,849
 land of Nephi

36
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:58,489
6 And king Mosiah went and inquired of the Lord if

37
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:01,156
 he should let his sons go up among the Lamanites

38
00:01:01,156 --> 00:01:03,823
 to preach the word

39
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,797
7 And the Lord said unto Mosiah: Let them go up,

40
00:01:05,797 --> 00:01:07,797
 for many shall believe on their words, and they

41
00:01:07,797 --> 00:01:09,797
 shall have eternal life; and I will deliver thy sons

42
00:01:09,797 --> 00:01:11,797
 out of the hands of the Lamanites

43
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:15,772
8 And it came to pass that Mosiah granted that

44
00:01:15,772 --> 00:01:19,772
 they might go and do according to their request

45
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,746
9 And they took their journey into the wilderness

46
00:01:21,746 --> 00:01:23,746
 to go up to preach the word among the Lamanites;

47
00:01:23,746 --> 00:01:25,746
 and I shall give an account of their proceedings

48
00:01:25,746 --> 00:01:27,746
 hereafter

49
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:30,388
10 Now king Mosiah had no one to confer the

50
00:01:30,388 --> 00:01:33,055
 kingdom upon, for there was not any of his sons who

51
00:01:33,055 --> 00:01:35,722
 would accept of the kingdom

52
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:36,696
11 Therefore he took the records which were

53
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:37,696
 engraven on the plates of brass, and also the plates of

54
00:01:37,696 --> 00:01:38,696
 Nephi, and all the things which he had kept and

55
00:01:38,696 --> 00:01:39,696
 preserved according to the commandments of God,

56
00:01:39,696 --> 00:01:40,696
 after having translated and caused to be written the

57
00:01:40,696 --> 00:01:41,696
 records which were on the plates of gold which had

58
00:01:41,696 --> 00:01:42,696
 been found by the people of Limhi, which were

59
00:01:42,696 --> 00:01:43,696
 delivered to him by the hand of Limhi

60
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:45,67
12 And this he did because of the great anxiety of

61
00:01:45,67 --> 00:01:47,67
 his people; for they were desirous beyond measure

62
00:01:47,67 --> 00:01:49,67
 to know concerning those people who had been

63
00:01:49,67 --> 00:01:51,67
 destroyed

64
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:54,312
13 And now he translated them by the means of

65
00:01:54,312 --> 00:01:56,979
 those two stones which were fastened into the two rims

66
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:59,646
 of a bow

67
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:02,287
14 Now these things were prepared from the

68
00:02:02,287 --> 00:02:04,954
 beginning, and were handed down from generation to

69
00:02:04,954 --> 00:02:07,621
 generation, for the purpose of interpreting languages

70
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,594
15 And they have been kept and preserved by the

71
00:02:09,594 --> 00:02:11,594
 hand of the Lord, that he should discover to every

72
00:02:11,594 --> 00:02:13,594
 creature who should possess the land the iniquities

73
00:02:13,594 --> 00:02:15,594
 and abominations of his people

74
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:19,569
16 And whosoever has these things is called seer,

75
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:23,569
 after the manner of old times

76
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:24,543
17 Now after Mosiah had finished translating these

77
00:02:24,543 --> 00:02:25,543
 records, behold, it gave an account of the people

78
00:02:25,543 --> 00:02:26,543
 who were destroyed, from the time that they were

79
00:02:26,543 --> 00:02:27,543
 destroyed back to the building of the great tower,

80
00:02:27,543 --> 00:02:28,543
 at the time the Lord confounded the language of

81
00:02:28,543 --> 00:02:29,543
 the people and they were scattered abroad upon the

82
00:02:29,543 --> 00:02:30,543
 face of all the earth, yea, and even from that

83
00:02:30,543 --> 00:02:31,543
 time back until the creation of Adam

84
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,518
18 Now this account did cause the people of Mosiah

85
00:02:33,518 --> 00:02:35,518
 to mourn exceedingly, yea, they were filled with

86
00:02:35,518 --> 00:02:37,518
 sorrow; nevertheless it gave them much knowledge,

87
00:02:37,518 --> 00:02:39,518
 in the which they did rejoice

88
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:42,16
19 And this account shall be written hereafter;

89
00:02:42,16 --> 00:02:44,827
 for behold, it is expedient that all people should

90
00:02:44,827 --> 00:02:47,494
 know the things which are written in this account

91
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:48,267
20 And now, as I said unto you, that after king

92
00:02:48,267 --> 00:02:49,067
 Mosiah had done these things, he took the plates of

93
00:02:49,067 --> 00:02:49,867
 brass, and all the things which he had kept, and

94
00:02:49,867 --> 00:02:50,667
 conferred them upon Alma, who was the son of Alma;

95
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:51,467
 yea, all the records, and also the interpreters,

96
00:02:51,467 --> 00:02:52,267
 and conferred them upon him, and commanded him that

97
00:02:52,267 --> 00:02:53,067
 he should keep and preserve them, and also keep a

98
00:02:53,067 --> 00:02:53,867
 record of the people, handing them down from one

99
00:02:53,867 --> 00:02:54,667
 generation to another, even as they had been

100
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:55,467
 handed down from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem.
