00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,75
Chapter 22 Plans are made for the people to escape

2
00:00:01,75 --> 00:00:03,5
 from Lamanite bondage—The Lamanites are made

3
00:00:03,5 --> 00:00:05,25
 drunk—The people escape, return to Zarahemla, and

4
00:00:05,25 --> 00:00:07,0
 become subject to King Mosiah. About 121–120 B.C.

5
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,118
1 And now it came to pass that Ammon and king

6
00:00:09,118 --> 00:00:10,261
 Limhi began to consult with the people how they should

7
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:11,404
 deliver themselves out of bondage; and even they

8
00:00:11,404 --> 00:00:12,547
 did cause that all the people should gather

9
00:00:12,547 --> 00:00:13,69
 themselves together; and this they did that they might

10
00:00:13,69 --> 00:00:14,833
 have the voice of the people concerning the matter

11
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:15,976


12
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,949
2 And it came to pass that they could find no way

13
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:19,949
 to deliver themselves out of bondage, except it

14
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:21,949
 were to take their women and children, and their

15
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:23,949
 flocks, and their herds, and their tents, and depart

16
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:25,949
 into the wilderness; for the Lamanites being so

17
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:27,949
 numerous, it was impossible for the people of Limhi

18
00:00:27,949 --> 00:00:29,949
 to contend with them, thinking to deliver

19
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:31,949
 themselves out of bondage by the sword

20
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:35,099
3 Now it came to pass that Gideon went forth and

21
00:00:35,099 --> 00:00:38,299
 stood before the king, and said unto him: Now O

22
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:41,499
 king, thou hast hitherto hearkened unto my words many

23
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:44,699
 times when we have been contending with our

24
00:00:44,699 --> 00:00:47,899
 brethren, the Lamanites

25
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:48,991
4 And now O king, if thou hast not found me to be

26
00:00:48,991 --> 00:00:50,134
 an unprofitable servant, or if thou hast hitherto

27
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:51,277
 listened to my words in any degree, and they have

28
00:00:51,277 --> 00:00:52,42
 been of service to thee, even so I desire that

29
00:00:52,42 --> 00:00:53,563
 thou wouldst listen to my words at this time, and I

30
00:00:53,563 --> 00:00:54,706
 will be thy servant and deliver this people out of

31
00:00:54,706 --> 00:00:55,849
 bondage

32
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:59,822
5 And the king granted unto him that he might

33
00:00:59,822 --> 00:01:03,822
 speak. And Gideon said unto him

34
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:04,94
6 Behold the back pass, through the back wall, on

35
00:01:04,94 --> 00:01:06,083
 the back side of the city. The Lamanites, or the

36
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:07,226
 guards of the Lamanites, by night are drunken;

37
00:01:07,226 --> 00:01:08,369
 therefore let us send a proclamation among all this

38
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:09,512
 people that they gather together their flocks and

39
00:01:09,512 --> 00:01:10,655
 herds, that they may drive them into the wilderness

40
00:01:10,655 --> 00:01:11,798
 by night

41
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:13,372
7 And I will go according to thy command and pay

42
00:01:13,372 --> 00:01:14,972
 the last tribute of wine to the Lamanites, and they

43
00:01:14,972 --> 00:01:16,572
 will be drunken; and we will pass through the

44
00:01:16,572 --> 00:01:18,172
 secret pass on the left of their camp when they are

45
00:01:18,172 --> 00:01:19,772
 drunken and asleep

46
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,413
8 Thus we will depart with our women and our

47
00:01:22,413 --> 00:01:25,08
 children, our flocks, and our herds into the

48
00:01:25,08 --> 00:01:27,747
 wilderness; and we will travel around the land of Shilom

49
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:31,721
9 And it came to pass that the king hearkened unto

50
00:01:31,721 --> 00:01:35,721
 the words of Gideon

51
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,029
10 And king Limhi caused that his people should

52
00:01:37,029 --> 00:01:38,362
 gather their flocks together; and he sent the

53
00:01:38,362 --> 00:01:39,695
 tribute of wine to the Lamanites; and he also sent more

54
00:01:39,695 --> 00:01:41,028
 wine, as a present unto them; and they did drink

55
00:01:41,028 --> 00:01:42,361
 freely of the wine which king Limhi did send unto

56
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:43,694
 them

57
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:45,003
11 And it came to pass that the people of king

58
00:01:45,003 --> 00:01:46,336
 Limhi did depart by night into the wilderness with

59
00:01:46,336 --> 00:01:47,669
 their flocks and their herds, and they went round

60
00:01:47,669 --> 00:01:49,002
 about the land of Shilom in the wilderness, and bent

61
00:01:49,002 --> 00:01:50,335
 their course towards the land of Zarahemla, being

62
00:01:50,335 --> 00:01:51,668
 led by Ammon and his brethren

63
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:53,645
12 And they had taken all their gold, and silver,

64
00:01:53,645 --> 00:01:55,645
 and their precious things, which they could carry,

65
00:01:55,645 --> 00:01:57,645
 and also their provisions with them, into the

66
00:01:57,645 --> 00:01:59,645
 wilderness; and they pursued their journey

67
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:02,287
13 And after being many days in the wilderness

68
00:02:02,287 --> 00:02:04,954
 they arrived in the land of Zarahemla, and joined

69
00:02:04,954 --> 00:02:07,621
 Mosiah’s people, and became his subjects

70
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,594
14 And it came to pass that Mosiah received them

71
00:02:09,594 --> 00:02:11,594
 with joy; and he also received their records, and

72
00:02:11,594 --> 00:02:13,594
 also the records which had been found by the people

73
00:02:13,594 --> 00:02:15,594
 of Limhi

74
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:17,569
15 And now it came to pass when the Lamanites had

75
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:19,569
 found that the people of Limhi had departed out of

76
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:21,569
 the land by night, that they sent an army into

77
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:23,569
 the wilderness to pursue them

78
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:26,21
16 And after they had pursued them two days, they

79
00:02:26,21 --> 00:02:28,877
 could no longer follow their tracks; therefore

80
00:02:28,877 --> 00:02:31,544
 they were lost in the wilderness.
