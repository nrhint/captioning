1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 22 Plans are made for the people to

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
escape from Lamanite bondage—The Lamanites are made

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
drunk—The people escape, return to Zarahemla, and

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:14:52,
become subject to King Mosiah. About 121–120 B.C. 

5
00:14:52,0 --> 00:14:52,0
1 And now it came to pass that Ammon and

6
00:14:52,0 --> 00:14:52,0
king Limhi began to consult with the people

7
00:14:52,0 --> 00:14:52,0
how they should deliver themselves out of

8
00:14:52,0 --> 00:14:52,0
bondage; and even they did cause that all

9
00:14:52,0 --> 00:14:52,0
the people should gather themselves

10
00:14:52,0 --> 00:14:52,0
together; and this they did that they might

11
00:14:52,0 --> 00:14:24,
have the voice of the people concerning the matter.

12
00:14:24,0 --> 00:14:24,0
2 And it came to pass that they could

13
00:14:24,0 --> 00:14:24,0
find no way to deliver themselves out

14
00:14:24,0 --> 00:14:24,0
of bondage, except it were to take

15
00:14:24,0 --> 00:14:24,0
their women and children, and their

16
00:14:24,0 --> 00:14:24,0
flocks, and their herds, and their tents,

17
00:14:24,0 --> 00:14:24,0
and depart into the wilderness; for the

18
00:14:24,0 --> 00:14:24,0
Lamanites being so numerous, it was

19
00:14:24,0 --> 00:14:24,0
impossible for the people of Limhi to

20
00:14:24,0 --> 00:14:24,0
contend with them, thinking to deliver

21
00:14:24,0 --> 00:16:22,
themselves out of bondage by the sword.

22
00:16:22,0 --> 00:16:22,0
3 Now it came to pass that Gideon

23
00:16:22,0 --> 00:16:22,0
went forth and stood before the king,

24
00:16:22,0 --> 00:16:22,0
and said unto him: Now O king, thou

25
00:16:22,0 --> 00:16:22,0
hast hitherto hearkened unto my

26
00:16:22,0 --> 00:16:22,0
words many times when we have been

27
00:16:22,0 --> 00:17:52,
contending with our brethren, the Lamanites.

28
00:17:52,0 --> 00:17:52,0
4 And now O king, if thou hast not

29
00:17:52,0 --> 00:17:52,0
found me to be an unprofitable

30
00:17:52,0 --> 00:17:52,0
servant, or if thou hast hitherto

31
00:17:52,0 --> 00:17:52,0
listened to my words in any degree,

32
00:17:52,0 --> 00:17:52,0
and they have been of service to

33
00:17:52,0 --> 00:17:52,0
thee, even so I desire that thou

34
00:17:52,0 --> 00:17:52,0
wouldst listen to my words at this

35
00:17:52,0 --> 00:17:52,0
time, and I will be thy servant and

36
00:17:52,0 --> 00:17:24,
deliver this people out of bondage.

37
00:17:24,0 --> 00:17:24,0
5 And the king granted

38
00:17:24,0 --> 00:17:24,0
unto him that he might speak.

39
00:17:24,0 --> 00:18:22,
And Gideon said unto him:

40
00:18:22,0 --> 00:18:22,0
6 Behold the back pass,

41
00:18:22,0 --> 00:18:22,0
through the back wall, on

42
00:18:22,0 --> 00:18:22,0
the back side of the

43
00:18:22,0 --> 00:18:22,0
city. The Lamanites, or the

44
00:18:22,0 --> 00:18:22,0
guards of the Lamanites,

45
00:18:22,0 --> 00:18:22,0
by night are drunken;

46
00:18:22,0 --> 00:18:22,0
therefore let us send a

47
00:18:22,0 --> 00:18:22,0
proclamation among all this

48
00:18:22,0 --> 00:18:22,0
people that they gather

49
00:18:22,0 --> 00:18:22,0
together their flocks and

50
00:18:22,0 --> 00:18:22,0
herds, that they may drive

51
00:18:22,0 --> 00:17:54,
them into the wilderness by night.

52
00:17:54,0 --> 00:17:54,0
7 And I will go

53
00:17:54,0 --> 00:17:54,0
according to thy command and pay

54
00:17:54,0 --> 00:17:54,0
the last tribute of

55
00:17:54,0 --> 00:17:54,0
wine to the Lamanites, and

56
00:17:54,0 --> 00:17:54,0
they will be drunken;

57
00:17:54,0 --> 00:17:54,0
and we will pass through

58
00:17:54,0 --> 00:17:54,0
the secret pass on the

59
00:17:54,0 --> 00:17:54,0
left of their camp when

60
00:17:54,0 --> 00:17:26,
they are drunken and asleep.

61
00:17:26,0 --> 00:17:26,0
8 Thus we will depart

62
00:17:26,0 --> 00:17:26,0
with our women and

63
00:17:26,0 --> 00:17:26,0
our children, our

64
00:17:26,0 --> 00:17:26,0
flocks, and our herds

65
00:17:26,0 --> 00:17:26,0
into the wilderness; and

66
00:17:26,0 --> 00:17:26,0
we will travel

67
00:17:26,0 --> 00:17:56,
around the land of Shilom.

68
00:17:56,0 --> 00:17:56,0
9 And it came to

69
00:17:56,0 --> 00:17:56,0
pass that the

70
00:17:56,0 --> 00:17:56,0
king hearkened unto

71
00:17:56,0 --> 00:17:28,
the words of Gideon.

72
00:17:28,0 --> 00:17:28,0
10 And king

73
00:17:28,0 --> 00:17:28,0
Limhi caused that

74
00:17:28,0 --> 00:17:28,0
his people should

75
00:17:28,0 --> 00:17:28,0
gather their

76
00:17:28,0 --> 00:17:28,0
flocks together;

77
00:17:28,0 --> 00:17:28,0
and he sent the

78
00:17:28,0 --> 00:17:28,0
tribute of wine to

79
00:17:28,0 --> 00:17:28,0
the Lamanites;

80
00:17:28,0 --> 00:17:28,0
and he also sent

81
00:17:28,0 --> 00:17:28,0
more wine, as a

82
00:17:28,0 --> 00:17:28,0
present unto

83
00:17:28,0 --> 00:17:28,0
them; and they did

84
00:17:28,0 --> 00:17:28,0
drink freely of

85
00:17:28,0 --> 00:17:28,0
the wine which

86
00:17:28,0 --> 00:18:26,
king Limhi did send unto them.

87
00:18:26,0 --> 00:18:26,0
11 And it came

88
00:18:26,0 --> 00:18:26,0
to pass that

89
00:18:26,0 --> 00:18:26,0
the people of

90
00:18:26,0 --> 00:18:26,0
king Limhi did

91
00:18:26,0 --> 00:18:26,0
depart by night

92
00:18:26,0 --> 00:18:26,0
into the

93
00:18:26,0 --> 00:18:26,0
wilderness with their

94
00:18:26,0 --> 00:18:26,0
flocks and their

95
00:18:26,0 --> 00:18:26,0
herds, and

96
00:18:26,0 --> 00:18:26,0
they went round

97
00:18:26,0 --> 00:18:26,0
about the land of

98
00:18:26,0 --> 00:18:26,0
Shilom in the

99
00:18:26,0 --> 00:18:26,0
wilderness, and

100
00:18:26,0 --> 00:18:26,0
bent their

101
00:18:26,0 --> 00:18:26,0
course towards the

102
00:18:26,0 --> 00:18:26,0
land of

103
00:18:26,0 --> 00:18:26,0
Zarahemla, being led

104
00:18:26,0 --> 00:19:38,
by Ammon and his brethren.

105
00:19:38,0 --> 00:19:38,0
12 And they

106
00:19:38,0 --> 00:19:38,0
had taken all

107
00:19:38,0 --> 00:19:38,0
their gold, and

108
00:19:38,0 --> 00:19:38,0
silver, and

109
00:19:38,0 --> 00:19:38,0
their precious

110
00:19:38,0 --> 00:19:38,0
things, which

111
00:19:38,0 --> 00:19:38,0
they could

112
00:19:38,0 --> 00:19:38,0
carry, and also

113
00:19:38,0 --> 00:19:38,0
their provisions

114
00:19:38,0 --> 00:19:38,0
with them,

115
00:19:38,0 --> 00:19:38,0
into the

116
00:19:38,0 --> 00:19:38,0
wilderness; and they

117
00:19:38,0 --> 00:23:23,
pursued their journey.

118
00:23:23,0 --> 00:23:23,0
13 And after

119
00:23:23,0 --> 00:23:23,0
being many

120
00:23:23,0 --> 00:23:23,0
days in the

121
00:23:23,0 --> 00:23:23,0
wilderness they

122
00:23:23,0 --> 00:23:23,0
arrived in

123
00:23:23,0 --> 00:23:23,0
the land of

124
00:23:23,0 --> 00:23:23,0
Zarahemla, and

125
00:23:23,0 --> 00:23:23,0
joined

126
00:23:23,0 --> 00:23:23,0
Mosiah’s people, and

127
00:23:23,0 --> 00:27:22,
became his subjects.

128
00:27:22,0 --> 00:27:22,0
14 And it

129
00:27:22,0 --> 00:27:22,0
came to pass

130
00:27:22,0 --> 00:27:22,0
that Mosiah

131
00:27:22,0 --> 00:27:22,0
received them

132
00:27:22,0 --> 00:27:22,0
with joy;

133
00:27:22,0 --> 00:27:22,0
and he also

134
00:27:22,0 --> 00:27:22,0
received

135
00:27:22,0 --> 00:27:22,0
their records,

136
00:27:22,0 --> 00:27:22,0
and also the

137
00:27:22,0 --> 00:27:22,0
records

138
00:27:22,0 --> 00:27:22,0
which had been

139
00:27:22,0 --> 00:27:22,0
found by the

140
00:27:22,0 --> 00:30:18,
people of Limhi.

141
00:30:18,0 --> 00:30:18,0
15 And now

142
00:30:18,0 --> 00:30:18,0
it came to

143
00:30:18,0 --> 00:30:18,0
pass when

144
00:30:18,0 --> 00:30:18,0
the

145
00:30:18,0 --> 00:30:18,0
Lamanites had found

146
00:30:18,0 --> 00:30:18,0
that the

147
00:30:18,0 --> 00:30:18,0
people of

148
00:30:18,0 --> 00:30:18,0
Limhi had

149
00:30:18,0 --> 00:30:18,0
departed out

150
00:30:18,0 --> 00:30:18,0
of the land

151
00:30:18,0 --> 00:30:18,0
by night,

152
00:30:18,0 --> 00:30:18,0
that they

153
00:30:18,0 --> 00:30:18,0
sent an army

154
00:30:18,0 --> 00:30:18,0
into the

155
00:30:18,0 --> 00:33:49,
wilderness to pursue them;

156
00:33:49,0 --> 00:33:49,0
16 And

157
00:33:49,0 --> 00:33:49,0
after they

158
00:33:49,0 --> 00:33:49,0
had pursued

159
00:33:49,0 --> 00:33:49,0
them two

160
00:33:49,0 --> 00:33:49,0
days, they

161
00:33:49,0 --> 00:33:49,0
could no

162
00:33:49,0 --> 00:33:49,0
longer

163
00:33:49,0 --> 00:33:49,0
follow their

164
00:33:49,0 --> 00:33:49,0
tracks;

165
00:33:49,0 --> 00:33:49,0
therefore

166
00:33:49,0 --> 00:33:49,0
they were

167
00:33:49,0 --> 00:33:21,
lost in the wilderness.
