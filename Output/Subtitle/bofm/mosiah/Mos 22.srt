1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:08,5
Chapter 22 Plans are made for the people to

2
00:00:08,5 --> 00:00:17,0
escape from Lamanite bondage—The Lamanites are made

3
00:00:17,0 --> 00:00:25,5
drunk—The people escape, return to Zarahemla, and

4
00:00:25,5 --> 00:00:34,902
become subject to King Mosiah. About 121–120 B.C. 

5
00:00:34,902 --> 00:00:34,759
1 And now it came to pass that Ammon and

6
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:34,616
king Limhi began to consult with the people

7
00:00:34,616 --> 00:00:34,473
how they should deliver themselves out of

8
00:00:34,473 --> 00:00:34,33
bondage; and even they did cause that all

9
00:00:34,33 --> 00:00:34,187
the people should gather themselves

10
00:00:34,187 --> 00:00:34,044
together; and this they did that they might

11
00:00:34,044 --> 00:00:33,967
have the voice of the people concerning the matter.

12
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:34,067
2 And it came to pass that they could

13
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:34,167
find no way to deliver themselves out

14
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:34,267
of bondage, except it were to take

15
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:34,367
their women and children, and their

16
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:34,467
flocks, and their herds, and their tents,

17
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:34,567
and depart into the wilderness; for the

18
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:34,667
Lamanites being so numerous, it was

19
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:34,767
impossible for the people of Limhi to

20
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:34,867
contend with them, thinking to deliver

21
00:00:34,867 --> 00:00:34,434
themselves out of bondage by the sword.

22
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:34,767
3 Now it came to pass that Gideon

23
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:35,1
went forth and stood before the king,

24
00:00:35,1 --> 00:00:35,433
and said unto him: Now O king, thou

25
00:00:35,433 --> 00:00:35,766
hast hitherto hearkened unto my

26
00:00:35,766 --> 00:00:36,099
words many times when we have been

27
00:00:36,099 --> 00:00:36,37
contending with our brethren, the Lamanites.

28
00:00:36,37 --> 00:00:36,259
4 And now O king, if thou hast not

29
00:00:36,259 --> 00:00:36,148
found me to be an unprofitable

30
00:00:36,148 --> 00:00:36,037
servant, or if thou hast hitherto

31
00:00:36,037 --> 00:00:35,926
listened to my words in any degree,

32
00:00:35,926 --> 00:00:35,815
and they have been of service to

33
00:00:35,815 --> 00:00:35,704
thee, even so I desire that thou

34
00:00:35,704 --> 00:00:35,593
wouldst listen to my words at this

35
00:00:35,593 --> 00:00:35,482
time, and I will be thy servant and

36
00:00:35,482 --> 00:00:35,435
deliver this people out of bondage.

37
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:35,102
5 And the king granted

38
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:34,769
unto him that he might speak.

39
00:00:34,769 --> 00:00:34,501
And Gideon said unto him:

40
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:34,668
6 Behold the back pass,

41
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:34,835
through the back wall, on

42
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:35,002
the back side of the

43
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:35,169
city. The Lamanites, or the

44
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:35,336
guards of the Lamanites,

45
00:00:35,336 --> 00:00:35,503
by night are drunken;

46
00:00:35,503 --> 00:00:35,67
therefore let us send a

47
00:00:35,67 --> 00:00:35,837
proclamation among all this

48
00:00:35,837 --> 00:00:36,004
people that they gather

49
00:00:36,004 --> 00:00:36,171
together their flocks and

50
00:00:36,171 --> 00:00:36,338
herds, that they may drive

51
00:00:36,338 --> 00:00:36,904
them into the wilderness by night.

52
00:00:36,904 --> 00:00:36,793
7 And I will go

53
00:00:36,793 --> 00:00:36,682
according to thy command and pay

54
00:00:36,682 --> 00:00:36,571
the last tribute of

55
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:36,46
wine to the Lamanites, and

56
00:00:36,46 --> 00:00:36,349
they will be drunken;

57
00:00:36,349 --> 00:00:36,238
and we will pass through

58
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:36,127
the secret pass on the

59
00:00:36,127 --> 00:00:36,016
left of their camp when

60
00:00:36,016 --> 00:00:35,969
they are drunken and asleep.

61
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:35,969
8 Thus we will depart

62
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:35,969
with our women and

63
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:35,969
our children, our

64
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:35,969
flocks, and our herds

65
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:35,969
into the wilderness; and

66
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:35,969
we will travel

67
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:35,035
around the land of Shilom.

68
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:35,535
9 And it came to

69
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:36,035
pass that the

70
00:00:36,035 --> 00:00:36,535
king hearkened unto

71
00:00:36,535 --> 00:00:37,437
the words of Gideon.

72
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:37,37
10 And king

73
00:00:37,37 --> 00:00:37,303
Limhi caused that

74
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:37,236
his people should

75
00:00:37,236 --> 00:00:37,169
gather their

76
00:00:37,169 --> 00:00:37,102
flocks together;

77
00:00:37,102 --> 00:00:37,035
and he sent the

78
00:00:37,035 --> 00:00:36,968
tribute of wine to

79
00:00:36,968 --> 00:00:36,901
the Lamanites;

80
00:00:36,901 --> 00:00:36,834
and he also sent

81
00:00:36,834 --> 00:00:36,767
more wine, as a

82
00:00:36,767 --> 00:00:36,7
present unto

83
00:00:36,7 --> 00:00:36,633
them; and they did

84
00:00:36,633 --> 00:00:36,566
drink freely of

85
00:00:36,566 --> 00:00:36,499
the wine which

86
00:00:36,499 --> 00:00:36,503
king Limhi did send unto them.

87
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:36,447
11 And it came

88
00:00:36,447 --> 00:00:36,391
to pass that

89
00:00:36,391 --> 00:00:36,335
the people of

90
00:00:36,335 --> 00:00:36,279
king Limhi did

91
00:00:36,279 --> 00:00:36,223
depart by night

92
00:00:36,223 --> 00:00:36,167
into the

93
00:00:36,167 --> 00:00:36,111
wilderness with their

94
00:00:36,111 --> 00:00:36,055
flocks and their

95
00:00:36,055 --> 00:00:35,999
herds, and

96
00:00:35,999 --> 00:00:35,943
they went round

97
00:00:35,943 --> 00:00:35,887
about the land of

98
00:00:35,887 --> 00:00:35,831
Shilom in the

99
00:00:35,831 --> 00:00:35,775
wilderness, and

100
00:00:35,775 --> 00:00:35,719
bent their

101
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:35,663
course towards the

102
00:00:35,663 --> 00:00:35,607
land of

103
00:00:35,607 --> 00:00:35,551
Zarahemla, being led

104
00:00:35,551 --> 00:00:35,569
by Ammon and his brethren.

105
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:35,492
12 And they

106
00:00:35,492 --> 00:00:35,415
had taken all

107
00:00:35,415 --> 00:00:35,338
their gold, and

108
00:00:35,338 --> 00:00:35,261
silver, and

109
00:00:35,261 --> 00:00:35,184
their precious

110
00:00:35,184 --> 00:00:35,107
things, which

111
00:00:35,107 --> 00:00:35,03
they could

112
00:00:35,03 --> 00:00:34,953
carry, and also

113
00:00:34,953 --> 00:00:34,876
their provisions

114
00:00:34,876 --> 00:00:34,799
with them,

115
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:34,722
into the

116
00:00:34,722 --> 00:00:34,645
wilderness; and they

117
00:00:34,645 --> 00:00:34,635
pursued their journey.

118
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:34,835
13 And after

119
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:35,035
being many

120
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:35,235
days in the

121
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:35,435
wilderness they

122
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:35,635
arrived in

123
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:35,835
the land of

124
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:36,035
Zarahemla, and

125
00:00:36,035 --> 00:00:36,235
joined

126
00:00:36,235 --> 00:00:36,435
Mosiah’s people, and

127
00:00:36,435 --> 00:00:36,57
became his subjects.

128
00:00:36,57 --> 00:00:36,493
14 And it

129
00:00:36,493 --> 00:00:36,416
came to pass

130
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:36,339
that Mosiah

131
00:00:36,339 --> 00:00:36,262
received them

132
00:00:36,262 --> 00:00:36,185
with joy;

133
00:00:36,185 --> 00:00:36,108
and he also

134
00:00:36,108 --> 00:00:36,031
received

135
00:00:36,031 --> 00:00:35,954
their records,

136
00:00:35,954 --> 00:00:35,877
and also the

137
00:00:35,877 --> 00:00:35,8
records

138
00:00:35,8 --> 00:00:35,723
which had been

139
00:00:35,723 --> 00:00:35,646
found by the

140
00:00:35,646 --> 00:00:35,636
people of Limhi.

141
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:35,569
15 And now

142
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:35,502
it came to

143
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:35,435
pass when

144
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:35,368
the

145
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:35,301
Lamanites had found

146
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:35,234
that the

147
00:00:35,234 --> 00:00:35,167
people of

148
00:00:35,167 --> 00:00:35,1
Limhi had

149
00:00:35,1 --> 00:00:35,033
departed out

150
00:00:35,033 --> 00:00:34,966
of the land

151
00:00:34,966 --> 00:00:34,899
by night,

152
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:34,832
that they

153
00:00:34,832 --> 00:00:34,765
sent an army

154
00:00:34,765 --> 00:00:34,698
into the

155
00:00:34,698 --> 00:00:34,701
wilderness to pursue them;

156
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:34,951
16 And

157
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:35,201
after they

158
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:35,451
had pursued

159
00:00:35,451 --> 00:00:35,701
them two

160
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:35,951
days, they

161
00:00:35,951 --> 00:00:36,201
could no

162
00:00:36,201 --> 00:00:36,451
longer

163
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:36,701
follow their

164
00:00:36,701 --> 00:00:36,951
tracks;

165
00:00:36,951 --> 00:00:37,201
therefore

166
00:00:37,201 --> 00:00:37,451
they were

167
00:00:37,451 --> 00:00:37,104
lost in the wilderness.
