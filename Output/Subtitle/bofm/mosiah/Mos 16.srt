00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:05,2
Chapter 16 God redeems men from their lost

2
00:00:05,2 --> 00:00:10,4
and fallen state—Those who are carnal

3
00:00:10,4 --> 00:00:15,6
remain as though there were no redemption—Christ

4
00:00:15,6 --> 00:00:20,8
brings to pass a resurrection to endless

5
00:00:20,8 --> 00:00:26,894
life or to endless damnation. About 148 B.C. 

6
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:27,894
1 And now, it came to pass that after

7
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:28,894
Abinadi had spoken these words he stretched

8
00:00:28,894 --> 00:00:29,894
forth his hand and said: The time shall come

9
00:00:29,894 --> 00:00:30,894
when all shall see the salvation of the

10
00:00:30,894 --> 00:00:31,894
Lord; when every nation, kindred, tongue,

11
00:00:31,894 --> 00:00:32,894
and people shall see eye to eye and shall

12
00:00:32,894 --> 00:00:33,233
confess before God that his judgments are just.

13
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:35,733
2 And then shall the wicked be cast

14
00:00:35,733 --> 00:00:38,233
out, and they shall have cause to

15
00:00:38,233 --> 00:00:40,733
howl, and weep, and wail, and gnash their

16
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:43,233
teeth; and this because they would

17
00:00:43,233 --> 00:00:45,733
not hearken unto the voice of the

18
00:00:45,733 --> 00:00:48,248
Lord; therefore the Lord redeemeth them not.

19
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:51,581
3 For they are carnal and

20
00:00:51,581 --> 00:00:54,914
devilish, and the devil has power over

21
00:00:54,914 --> 00:00:58,247
them; yea, even that old serpent

22
00:00:58,247 --> 00:01:01,58
that did beguile our first

23
00:01:01,58 --> 00:01:04,913
parents, which was the cause of their

24
00:01:04,913 --> 00:01:08,246
fall; which was the cause of all

25
00:01:08,246 --> 00:01:11,579
mankind becoming carnal, sensual,

26
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:14,912
devilish, knowing evil from good,

27
00:01:14,912 --> 00:01:18,011
subjecting themselves to the devil.

28
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:17,811
4 Thus all mankind were lost;

29
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:17,611
and behold, they would have

30
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:17,411
been endlessly lost were it not

31
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:17,211
that God redeemed his people

32
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:17,544
from their lost and fallen state.

33
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:18,453
5 But remember that he that

34
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:19,362
persists in his own carnal

35
00:01:19,362 --> 00:01:20,271
nature, and goes on in the

36
00:01:20,271 --> 00:01:21,18
ways of sin and rebellion

37
00:01:21,18 --> 00:01:22,089
against God, remaineth in

38
00:01:22,089 --> 00:01:22,998
his fallen state and the

39
00:01:22,998 --> 00:01:23,907
devil hath all power over him.

40
00:01:23,907 --> 00:01:24,816
Therefore he is as though

41
00:01:24,816 --> 00:01:25,725
there was no redemption

42
00:01:25,725 --> 00:01:26,634
made, being an enemy to God;

43
00:01:26,634 --> 00:01:27,888
and also is the devil an enemy to God.

44
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:29,555
6 And now if Christ had

45
00:01:29,555 --> 00:01:31,222
not come into the world,

46
00:01:31,222 --> 00:01:32,889
speaking of things to

47
00:01:32,889 --> 00:01:34,556
come as though they had

48
00:01:34,556 --> 00:01:36,223
already come, there could

49
00:01:36,223 --> 00:01:37,331
have been no redemption.

50
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:37,22
7 And if Christ had

51
00:01:37,22 --> 00:01:37,109
not risen from the

52
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:36,998
dead, or have broken the

53
00:01:36,998 --> 00:01:36,887
bands of death that

54
00:01:36,887 --> 00:01:36,776
the grave should have

55
00:01:36,776 --> 00:01:36,665
no victory, and that

56
00:01:36,665 --> 00:01:36,554
death should have no

57
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:36,443
sting, there could

58
00:01:36,443 --> 00:01:36,396
have been no resurrection.

59
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:37,729
8 But there is a

60
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:39,062
resurrection,

61
00:01:39,062 --> 00:01:40,395
therefore the grave hath

62
00:01:40,395 --> 00:01:41,728
no victory, and the

63
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:43,061
sting of death is

64
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,805
swallowed up in Christ.

65
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:46,205
9 He is the light

66
00:01:46,205 --> 00:01:47,605
and the life of

67
00:01:47,605 --> 00:01:49,005
the world; yea, a

68
00:01:49,005 --> 00:01:50,405
light that is

69
00:01:50,405 --> 00:01:51,805
endless, that can

70
00:01:51,805 --> 00:01:53,205
never be darkened;

71
00:01:53,205 --> 00:01:54,605
yea, and also a

72
00:01:54,605 --> 00:01:56,005
life which is

73
00:01:56,005 --> 00:01:57,405
endless, that there

74
00:01:57,405 --> 00:01:58,151
can be no more death.

75
00:01:58,151 --> 00:01:58,722
10 Even this

76
00:01:58,722 --> 00:01:59,293
mortal shall put on

77
00:01:59,293 --> 00:01:59,864
immortality,

78
00:01:59,864 --> 00:02:00,435
and this

79
00:02:00,435 --> 00:02:01,006
corruption shall put on

80
00:02:01,006 --> 00:02:01,577
incorruption, and

81
00:02:01,577 --> 00:02:02,148
shall be

82
00:02:02,148 --> 00:02:02,719
brought to stand

83
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,29
before the bar of

84
00:02:03,29 --> 00:02:03,861
God, to be judged

85
00:02:03,861 --> 00:02:04,432
of him according

86
00:02:04,432 --> 00:02:05,003
to their works

87
00:02:05,003 --> 00:02:05,574
whether they be

88
00:02:05,574 --> 00:02:06,56
good or whether they be evil—

89
00:02:06,56 --> 00:02:07,417
11 If they be

90
00:02:07,417 --> 00:02:08,274
good, to the

91
00:02:08,274 --> 00:02:09,131
resurrection of

92
00:02:09,131 --> 00:02:09,988
endless life and

93
00:02:09,988 --> 00:02:10,845
happiness; and

94
00:02:10,845 --> 00:02:11,702
if they be

95
00:02:11,702 --> 00:02:12,559
evil, to the

96
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:13,416
resurrection of

97
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:14,273
endless damnation,

98
00:02:14,273 --> 00:02:15,13
being delivered

99
00:02:15,13 --> 00:02:15,987
up to the

100
00:02:15,987 --> 00:02:16,844
devil, who hath

101
00:02:16,844 --> 00:02:17,701
subjected them,

102
00:02:17,701 --> 00:02:18,939
which is damnation—

103
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:19,579
12 Having gone

104
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:20,219
according to

105
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:20,859
their own

106
00:02:20,859 --> 00:02:21,499
carnal wills and

107
00:02:21,499 --> 00:02:22,139
desires; having

108
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:22,779
never called

109
00:02:22,779 --> 00:02:23,419
upon the Lord

110
00:02:23,419 --> 00:02:24,059
while the arms

111
00:02:24,059 --> 00:02:24,699
of mercy were

112
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:25,339
extended

113
00:02:25,339 --> 00:02:25,979
towards them; for

114
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:26,619
the arms of

115
00:02:26,619 --> 00:02:27,259
mercy were

116
00:02:27,259 --> 00:02:27,899
extended towards

117
00:02:27,899 --> 00:02:28,539
them, and they

118
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:29,179
would not; they

119
00:02:29,179 --> 00:02:29,819
being warned

120
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:30,459
of their

121
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:31,099
iniquities and yet

122
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:31,739
they would not

123
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:32,379
depart from

124
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:33,019
them; and they

125
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:33,659
were commanded

126
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:34,299
to repent and

127
00:02:34,299 --> 00:02:34,888
yet they would not repent.

128
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:35,221
13 And now,

129
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:35,554
ought ye not

130
00:02:35,554 --> 00:02:35,887
to tremble and

131
00:02:35,887 --> 00:02:36,22
repent of

132
00:02:36,22 --> 00:02:36,553
your sins, and

133
00:02:36,553 --> 00:02:36,886
remember that

134
00:02:36,886 --> 00:02:37,219
only in and

135
00:02:37,219 --> 00:02:37,552
through

136
00:02:37,552 --> 00:02:37,29
Christ ye can be saved?

137
00:02:37,29 --> 00:02:37,623
14

138
00:02:37,623 --> 00:02:37,956
Therefore, if ye

139
00:02:37,956 --> 00:02:38,289
teach the law of

140
00:02:38,289 --> 00:02:38,622
Moses, also

141
00:02:38,622 --> 00:02:38,955
teach that

142
00:02:38,955 --> 00:02:39,288
it is a

143
00:02:39,288 --> 00:02:39,621
shadow of those

144
00:02:39,621 --> 00:02:39,954
things which

145
00:02:39,954 --> 00:02:40,293
are to come—

146
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:40,626
15 Teach

147
00:02:40,626 --> 00:02:40,959
them that

148
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:41,292
redemption

149
00:02:41,292 --> 00:02:41,625
cometh through

150
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:41,958
Christ the

151
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:42,291
Lord, who

152
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:42,624
is the very

153
00:02:42,624 --> 00:02:42,957
Eternal

154
00:02:42,957 --> 00:02:43,764
Father. Amen.
