00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,4
Chapter 16 God redeems men from their lost and

2
00:00:01,4 --> 00:00:02,8
 fallen state—Those who are carnal remain as though

3
00:00:02,8 --> 00:00:04,2
 there were no redemption—Christ brings to pass a

4
00:00:04,2 --> 00:00:05,6
 resurrection to endless life or to endless damnation.

5
00:00:05,6 --> 00:00:07,0
 About 148 B.C.

6
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,308
1 And now, it came to pass that after Abinadi had

7
00:00:09,308 --> 00:00:10,641
 spoken these words he stretched forth his hand and

8
00:00:10,641 --> 00:00:11,974
 said: The time shall come when all shall see the

9
00:00:11,974 --> 00:00:13,307
 salvation of the Lord; when every nation, kindred,

10
00:00:13,307 --> 00:00:14,64
 tongue, and people shall see eye to eye and shall

11
00:00:14,64 --> 00:00:15,973
 confess before God that his judgments are just

12
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,549
2 And then shall the wicked be cast out, and they

13
00:00:17,549 --> 00:00:19,149
 shall have cause to howl, and weep, and wail, and

14
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:20,749
 gnash their teeth; and this because they would not

15
00:00:20,749 --> 00:00:22,349
 hearken unto the voice of the Lord; therefore the

16
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:23,949
 Lord redeemeth them not

17
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,257
3 For they are carnal and devilish, and the devil

18
00:00:25,257 --> 00:00:26,59
 has power over them; yea, even that old serpent

19
00:00:26,59 --> 00:00:27,923
 that did beguile our first parents, which was the

20
00:00:27,923 --> 00:00:29,256
 cause of their fall; which was the cause of all

21
00:00:29,256 --> 00:00:30,589
 mankind becoming carnal, sensual, devilish, knowing

22
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:31,922
 evil from good, subjecting themselves to the devil

23
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,899
4 Thus all mankind were lost; and behold, they

24
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,899
 would have been endlessly lost were it not that God

25
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:37,899
 redeemed his people from their lost and fallen

26
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:39,899
 state

27
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,016
5 But remember that he that persists in his own

28
00:00:41,016 --> 00:00:42,159
 carnal nature, and goes on in the ways of sin and

29
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:43,302
 rebellion against God, remaineth in his fallen state

30
00:00:43,302 --> 00:00:44,445
 and the devil hath all power over him. Therefore

31
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:45,588
 he is as though there was no redemption made,

32
00:00:45,588 --> 00:00:46,731
 being an enemy to God; and also is the devil an enemy

33
00:00:46,731 --> 00:00:47,874
 to God

34
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:55,848
6 And now if Christ had not come into the world,

35
00:00:55,848 --> 00:01:03,848
 speaking of things to come as though they had

36
00:01:03,848 --> 00:01:11,848
 already come, there could have been no redemption

37
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:15,772
7 And if Christ had not risen from the dead, or

38
00:01:15,772 --> 00:01:19,772
 have broken the bands of death that the grave should

39
00:01:19,772 --> 00:01:23,772
 have no victory, and that death should have no

40
00:01:23,772 --> 00:01:27,772
 sting, there could have been no resurrection

41
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:46,388
8 But there is a resurrection, therefore the grave

42
00:01:46,388 --> 00:02:05,055
 hath no victory, and the sting of death is

43
00:02:05,055 --> 00:02:23,722
 swallowed up in Christ

44
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:31,543
9 He is the light and the life of the world; yea,

45
00:02:31,543 --> 00:02:39,543
 a light that is endless, that can never be

46
00:02:39,543 --> 00:02:47,543
 darkened; yea, and also a life which is endless, that

47
00:02:47,543 --> 00:02:55,543
 there can be no more death

48
00:02:55,442 --> 00:03:00,242
10 Even this mortal shall put on immortality, and

49
00:03:00,242 --> 00:03:05,042
 this corruption shall put on incorruption, and

50
00:03:05,042 --> 00:03:09,842
 shall be brought to stand before the bar of God, to

51
00:03:09,842 --> 00:03:14,642
 be judged of him according to their works whether

52
00:03:14,642 --> 00:03:19,442
 they be good or whether they be evil

53
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:24,166
11 If they be good, to the resurrection of endless

54
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:28,966
 life and happiness; and if they be evil, to the

55
00:03:28,966 --> 00:03:33,766
 resurrection of endless damnation, being delivered

56
00:03:33,766 --> 00:03:38,566
 up to the devil, who hath subjected them, which is

57
00:03:38,566 --> 00:03:43,366
 damnation

58
00:03:43,29 --> 00:03:44,29
12 Having gone according to their own carnal wills

59
00:03:44,29 --> 00:03:45,29
 and desires; having never called upon the Lord

60
00:03:45,29 --> 00:03:46,29
 while the arms of mercy were extended towards them;

61
00:03:46,29 --> 00:03:47,29
 for the arms of mercy were extended towards them,

62
00:03:47,29 --> 00:03:48,29
 and they would not; they being warned of their

63
00:03:48,29 --> 00:03:49,29
 iniquities and yet they would not depart from them;

64
00:03:49,29 --> 00:03:50,29
 and they were commanded to repent and yet they

65
00:03:50,29 --> 00:03:51,29
 would not repent

66
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:56,597
13 And now, ought ye not to tremble and repent of

67
00:03:56,597 --> 00:04:01,93
 your sins, and remember that only in and through

68
00:04:01,93 --> 00:04:07,263
 Christ ye can be saved

69
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:20,547
14 Therefore, if ye teach the law of Moses, also

70
00:04:20,547 --> 00:04:33,88
 teach that it is a shadow of those things which are

71
00:04:33,88 --> 00:04:47,213
 to come

72
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:47,087
15 Teach them that redemption cometh through

73
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:47,087
 Christ the Lord, who is the very Eternal Father. Amen.

74
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:47,087
