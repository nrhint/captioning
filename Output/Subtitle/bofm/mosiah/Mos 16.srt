00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 16 God redeems men from their lost

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and fallen state—Those who are carnal

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
remain as though there were no redemption—Christ

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
brings to pass a resurrection to endless

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:14:09,
life or to endless damnation. About 148 B.C. 

6
00:14:09,0 --> 00:14:09,0
1 And now, it came to pass that after

7
00:14:09,0 --> 00:14:09,0
Abinadi had spoken these words he stretched

8
00:14:09,0 --> 00:14:09,0
forth his hand and said: The time shall come

9
00:14:09,0 --> 00:14:09,0
when all shall see the salvation of the

10
00:14:09,0 --> 00:14:09,0
Lord; when every nation, kindred, tongue,

11
00:14:09,0 --> 00:14:09,0
and people shall see eye to eye and shall

12
00:14:09,0 --> 00:22:07,
confess before God that his judgments are just.

13
00:22:07,0 --> 00:22:07,0
2 And then shall the wicked be cast

14
00:22:07,0 --> 00:22:07,0
out, and they shall have cause to

15
00:22:07,0 --> 00:22:07,0
howl, and weep, and wail, and gnash their

16
00:22:07,0 --> 00:22:07,0
teeth; and this because they would

17
00:22:07,0 --> 00:22:07,0
not hearken unto the voice of the

18
00:22:07,0 --> 00:23:19,
Lord; therefore the Lord redeemeth them not.

19
00:23:19,0 --> 00:23:19,0
3 For they are carnal and

20
00:23:19,0 --> 00:23:19,0
devilish, and the devil has power over

21
00:23:19,0 --> 00:23:19,0
them; yea, even that old serpent

22
00:23:19,0 --> 00:23:19,0
that did beguile our first

23
00:23:19,0 --> 00:23:19,0
parents, which was the cause of their

24
00:23:19,0 --> 00:23:19,0
fall; which was the cause of all

25
00:23:19,0 --> 00:23:19,0
mankind becoming carnal, sensual,

26
00:23:19,0 --> 00:23:19,0
devilish, knowing evil from good,

27
00:23:19,0 --> 00:22:51,
subjecting themselves to the devil.

28
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
4 Thus all mankind were lost;

29
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
and behold, they would have

30
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
been endlessly lost were it not

31
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
that God redeemed his people

32
00:22:51,0 --> 00:25:03,
from their lost and fallen state.

33
00:25:03,0 --> 00:25:03,0
5 But remember that he that

34
00:25:03,0 --> 00:25:03,0
persists in his own carnal

35
00:25:03,0 --> 00:25:03,0
nature, and goes on in the

36
00:25:03,0 --> 00:25:03,0
ways of sin and rebellion

37
00:25:03,0 --> 00:25:03,0
against God, remaineth in

38
00:25:03,0 --> 00:25:03,0
his fallen state and the

39
00:25:03,0 --> 00:25:03,0
devil hath all power over him.

40
00:25:03,0 --> 00:25:03,0
Therefore he is as though

41
00:25:03,0 --> 00:25:03,0
there was no redemption

42
00:25:03,0 --> 00:25:03,0
made, being an enemy to God;

43
00:25:03,0 --> 00:29:32,
and also is the devil an enemy to God.

44
00:29:32,0 --> 00:29:32,0
6 And now if Christ had

45
00:29:32,0 --> 00:29:32,0
not come into the world,

46
00:29:32,0 --> 00:29:32,0
speaking of things to

47
00:29:32,0 --> 00:29:32,0
come as though they had

48
00:29:32,0 --> 00:29:32,0
already come, there could

49
00:29:32,0 --> 00:29:04,
have been no redemption.

50
00:29:04,0 --> 00:29:04,0
7 And if Christ had

51
00:29:04,0 --> 00:29:04,0
not risen from the

52
00:29:04,0 --> 00:29:04,0
dead, or have broken the

53
00:29:04,0 --> 00:29:04,0
bands of death that

54
00:29:04,0 --> 00:29:04,0
the grave should have

55
00:29:04,0 --> 00:29:04,0
no victory, and that

56
00:29:04,0 --> 00:29:04,0
death should have no

57
00:29:04,0 --> 00:29:04,0
sting, there could

58
00:29:04,0 --> 00:37:59,
have been no resurrection.

59
00:37:59,0 --> 00:37:59,0
8 But there is a

60
00:37:59,0 --> 00:37:59,0
resurrection,

61
00:37:59,0 --> 00:37:59,0
therefore the grave hath

62
00:37:59,0 --> 00:37:59,0
no victory, and the

63
00:37:59,0 --> 00:37:59,0
sting of death is

64
00:37:59,0 --> 00:38:29,
swallowed up in Christ.

65
00:38:29,0 --> 00:38:29,0
9 He is the light

66
00:38:29,0 --> 00:38:29,0
and the life of

67
00:38:29,0 --> 00:38:29,0
the world; yea, a

68
00:38:29,0 --> 00:38:29,0
light that is

69
00:38:29,0 --> 00:38:29,0
endless, that can

70
00:38:29,0 --> 00:38:29,0
never be darkened;

71
00:38:29,0 --> 00:38:29,0
yea, and also a

72
00:38:29,0 --> 00:38:29,0
life which is

73
00:38:29,0 --> 00:38:29,0
endless, that there

74
00:38:29,0 --> 00:42:14,
can be no more death.

75
00:42:14,0 --> 00:42:14,0
10 Even this

76
00:42:14,0 --> 00:42:14,0
mortal shall put on

77
00:42:14,0 --> 00:42:14,0
immortality,

78
00:42:14,0 --> 00:42:14,0
and this

79
00:42:14,0 --> 00:42:14,0
corruption shall put on

80
00:42:14,0 --> 00:42:14,0
incorruption, and

81
00:42:14,0 --> 00:42:14,0
shall be

82
00:42:14,0 --> 00:42:14,0
brought to stand

83
00:42:14,0 --> 00:42:14,0
before the bar of

84
00:42:14,0 --> 00:42:14,0
God, to be judged

85
00:42:14,0 --> 00:42:14,0
of him according

86
00:42:14,0 --> 00:42:14,0
to their works

87
00:42:14,0 --> 00:42:14,0
whether they be

88
00:42:14,0 --> 00:42:28,
good or whether they be evil—

89
00:42:28,0 --> 00:42:28,0
11 If they be

90
00:42:28,0 --> 00:42:28,0
good, to the

91
00:42:28,0 --> 00:42:28,0
resurrection of

92
00:42:28,0 --> 00:42:28,0
endless life and

93
00:42:28,0 --> 00:42:28,0
happiness; and

94
00:42:28,0 --> 00:42:28,0
if they be

95
00:42:28,0 --> 00:42:28,0
evil, to the

96
00:42:28,0 --> 00:42:28,0
resurrection of

97
00:42:28,0 --> 00:42:28,0
endless damnation,

98
00:42:28,0 --> 00:42:28,0
being delivered

99
00:42:28,0 --> 00:42:28,0
up to the

100
00:42:28,0 --> 00:42:28,0
devil, who hath

101
00:42:28,0 --> 00:42:28,0
subjected them,

102
00:42:28,0 --> 00:42:58,
which is damnation—

103
00:42:58,0 --> 00:42:58,0
12 Having gone

104
00:42:58,0 --> 00:42:58,0
according to

105
00:42:58,0 --> 00:42:58,0
their own

106
00:42:58,0 --> 00:42:58,0
carnal wills and

107
00:42:58,0 --> 00:42:58,0
desires; having

108
00:42:58,0 --> 00:42:58,0
never called

109
00:42:58,0 --> 00:42:58,0
upon the Lord

110
00:42:58,0 --> 00:42:58,0
while the arms

111
00:42:58,0 --> 00:42:58,0
of mercy were

112
00:42:58,0 --> 00:42:58,0
extended

113
00:42:58,0 --> 00:42:58,0
towards them; for

114
00:42:58,0 --> 00:42:58,0
the arms of

115
00:42:58,0 --> 00:42:58,0
mercy were

116
00:42:58,0 --> 00:42:58,0
extended towards

117
00:42:58,0 --> 00:42:58,0
them, and they

118
00:42:58,0 --> 00:42:58,0
would not; they

119
00:42:58,0 --> 00:42:58,0
being warned

120
00:42:58,0 --> 00:42:58,0
of their

121
00:42:58,0 --> 00:42:58,0
iniquities and yet

122
00:42:58,0 --> 00:42:58,0
they would not

123
00:42:58,0 --> 00:42:58,0
depart from

124
00:42:58,0 --> 00:42:58,0
them; and they

125
00:42:58,0 --> 00:42:58,0
were commanded

126
00:42:58,0 --> 00:42:58,0
to repent and

127
00:42:58,0 --> 00:46:43,
yet they would not repent.

128
00:46:43,0 --> 00:46:43,0
13 And now,

129
00:46:43,0 --> 00:46:43,0
ought ye not

130
00:46:43,0 --> 00:46:43,0
to tremble and

131
00:46:43,0 --> 00:46:43,0
repent of

132
00:46:43,0 --> 00:46:43,0
your sins, and

133
00:46:43,0 --> 00:46:43,0
remember that

134
00:46:43,0 --> 00:46:43,0
only in and

135
00:46:43,0 --> 00:46:43,0
through

136
00:46:43,0 --> 00:56:53,
Christ ye can be saved?

137
00:56:53,0 --> 00:56:53,0
14

138
00:56:53,0 --> 00:56:53,0
Therefore, if ye

139
00:56:53,0 --> 00:56:53,0
teach the law of

140
00:56:53,0 --> 00:56:53,0
Moses, also

141
00:56:53,0 --> 00:56:53,0
teach that

142
00:56:53,0 --> 00:56:53,0
it is a

143
00:56:53,0 --> 00:56:53,0
shadow of those

144
00:56:53,0 --> 00:56:53,0
things which

145
00:56:53,0 --> 01:00:38,
are to come—

146
01:00:38,0 --> 01:00:38,0
15 Teach

147
01:00:38,0 --> 01:00:38,0
them that

148
01:00:38,0 --> 01:00:38,0
redemption

149
01:00:38,0 --> 01:00:38,0
cometh through

150
01:00:38,0 --> 01:00:38,0
Christ the

151
01:00:38,0 --> 01:00:38,0
Lord, who

152
01:00:38,0 --> 01:00:38,0
is the very

153
01:00:38,0 --> 01:00:38,0
Eternal

154
01:00:38,0 --> 01:07:18,
Father. Amen.
