00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 21 Limhi’s people are smitten and

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
defeated by the Lamanites—Limhi’s people meet

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Ammon and are converted—They tell Ammon of the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:05:29,
twenty-four Jaredite plates. About 122–121 B.C. 

5
00:05:29,0 --> 00:05:29,0
1 And it came to pass that Limhi and his

6
00:05:29,0 --> 00:05:29,0
people returned to the city of Nephi, and

7
00:05:29,0 --> 00:12:37,
began to dwell in the land again in peace.

8
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,0
2 And it came to pass that after

9
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,0
many days the Lamanites began again to

10
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,0
be stirred up in anger against the

11
00:12:37,0 --> 00:12:37,0
Nephites, and they began to come into

12
00:12:37,0 --> 00:16:21,
the borders of the land round about.

13
00:16:21,0 --> 00:16:21,0
3 Now they durst not slay them,

14
00:16:21,0 --> 00:16:21,0
because of the oath which their

15
00:16:21,0 --> 00:16:21,0
king had made unto Limhi; but

16
00:16:21,0 --> 00:16:21,0
they would smite them on their

17
00:16:21,0 --> 00:16:21,0
cheeks, and exercise authority over

18
00:16:21,0 --> 00:16:21,0
them; and began to put heavy

19
00:16:21,0 --> 00:16:21,0
burdens upon their backs, and

20
00:16:21,0 --> 00:19:52,
drive them as they would a dumb ass—

21
00:19:52,0 --> 00:19:52,0
4 Yea, all this was

22
00:19:52,0 --> 00:19:52,0
done that the word of the

23
00:19:52,0 --> 00:19:24,
Lord might be fulfilled.

24
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
5 And now the

25
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
afflictions of the Nephites

26
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
were great, and there

27
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
was no way that they

28
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
could deliver themselves

29
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
out of their hands,

30
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
for the Lamanites had

31
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,
surrounded them on every side.

32
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
6 And it came to pass

33
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
that the people

34
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
began to murmur with the

35
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
king because of their

36
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
afflictions; and

37
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
they began to be

38
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
desirous to go against them

39
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
to battle. And they

40
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
did afflict the king

41
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
sorely with their

42
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
complaints; therefore he

43
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
granted unto them

44
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
that they should do

45
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,
according to their desires.

46
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
7 And they gathered

47
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
themselves together

48
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
again, and put on

49
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
their armor, and went

50
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
forth against the

51
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
Lamanites to drive

52
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,
them out of their land.

53
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
8 And it came to

54
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
pass that the

55
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
Lamanites did beat them,

56
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
and drove them back,

57
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,
and slew many of them.

58
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
9 And now there

59
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
was a great mourning

60
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
and lamentation

61
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
among the people of

62
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
Limhi, the widow

63
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
mourning for her

64
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
husband, the son

65
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
and the daughter

66
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
mourning for their

67
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
father, and the

68
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,
brothers for their brethren.

69
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
10 Now there

70
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
were a great many

71
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
widows in the

72
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
land, and they did

73
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
cry mightily

74
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
from day to day,

75
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
for a great fear

76
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
of the Lamanites

77
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,
had come upon them.

78
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
11 And it came

79
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
to pass that

80
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
their continual

81
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
cries did stir

82
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
up the remainder

83
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
of the people

84
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
of Limhi to

85
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
anger against the

86
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
Lamanites; and

87
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
they went again

88
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
to battle, but

89
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
they were

90
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
driven back again,

91
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,
suffering much loss.

92
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
12 Yea, they

93
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
went again even

94
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
the third

95
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
time, and

96
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
suffered in the like

97
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
manner; and

98
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
those that were

99
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
not slain

100
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
returned again to

101
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,
the city of Nephi.

102
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
13 And they

103
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
did humble

104
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
themselves even

105
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
to the dust,

106
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
subjecting

107
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
themselves to

108
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
the yoke of

109
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
bondage,

110
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
submitting

111
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
themselves to be

112
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
smitten, and to

113
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
be driven to

114
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
and fro, and

115
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
burdened,

116
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
according to the

117
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,
desires of their enemies.

118
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
14 And they

119
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
did humble

120
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
themselves

121
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
even in the

122
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
depths of

123
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
humility; and

124
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
they did cry

125
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
mightily to

126
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
God; yea,

127
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
even all the

128
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
day long did

129
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
they cry unto

130
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
their God

131
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
that he would

132
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
deliver

133
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,
them out of their afflictions.

134
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
15 And now

135
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
the Lord

136
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
was slow to

137
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
hear their

138
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
cry because

139
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
of their

140
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
iniquities;

141
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
nevertheless

142
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
the Lord

143
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
did hear

144
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
their cries,

145
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
and began to

146
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
soften the

147
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
hearts of

148
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
the

149
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
Lamanites that

150
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
they began to

151
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
ease their

152
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
burdens;

153
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
yet the Lord

154
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
did not see

155
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
fit to

156
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,
deliver them out of bondage.

157
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
16 And it

158
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
came to pass

159
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
that they

160
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
began to

161
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
prosper by

162
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
degrees in

163
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
the land, and

164
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
began to

165
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
raise grain

166
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
more

167
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
abundantly, and

168
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
flocks, and

169
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
herds, that

170
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
they did

171
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
not suffer

172
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,
with hunger.

173
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
17 Now

174
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
there was a

175
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
great

176
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
number of

177
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
women, more

178
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
than there

179
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
was of men;

180
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
therefore

181
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
king Limhi

182
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
commanded

183
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
that

184
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
every man

185
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
should impart

186
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
to the

187
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
support of

188
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
the widows

189
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
and their

190
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
children,

191
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
that they

192
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
might not

193
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
perish with

194
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
hunger;

195
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
and this

196
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
they did

197
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
because of

198
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
the

199
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
greatness of their

200
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,
number that had been slain.

201
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
18 Now the

202
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
people of

203
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
Limhi

204
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
kept together

205
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
in a body

206
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
as much

207
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
as it was

208
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
possible,

209
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
and secured

210
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
their

211
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
grain and

212
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,
their flocks;

213
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
19 And

214
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
the king

215
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
himself did

216
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
not

217
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
trust his

218
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
person

219
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
without the

220
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
walls of

221
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
the city,

222
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
unless he

223
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
took his

224
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
guards

225
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
with him,

226
00:19:24,0 --> 00:19:24,0
fearing

227
