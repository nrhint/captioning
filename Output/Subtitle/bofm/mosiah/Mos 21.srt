1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:07,25
Chapter 21 Limhi’s people are smitten and

2
00:00:07,25 --> 00:00:14,5
defeated by the Lamanites—Limhi’s people meet

3
00:00:14,5 --> 00:00:21,75
Ammon and are converted—They tell Ammon of the

4
00:00:21,75 --> 00:00:29,763
twenty-four Jaredite plates. About 122–121 B.C. 

5
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:29,43
1 And it came to pass that Limhi and his

6
00:00:29,43 --> 00:00:29,097
people returned to the city of Nephi, and

7
00:00:29,097 --> 00:00:28,829
began to dwell in the land again in peace.

8
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:28,829
2 And it came to pass that after

9
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:28,829
many days the Lamanites began again to

10
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:28,829
be stirred up in anger against the

11
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:28,829
Nephites, and they began to come into

12
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:28,362
the borders of the land round about.

13
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,112
3 Now they durst not slay them,

14
00:00:30,112 --> 00:00:31,862
because of the oath which their

15
00:00:31,862 --> 00:00:33,612
king had made unto Limhi; but

16
00:00:33,612 --> 00:00:35,362
they would smite them on their

17
00:00:35,362 --> 00:00:37,112
cheeks, and exercise authority over

18
00:00:37,112 --> 00:00:38,862
them; and began to put heavy

19
00:00:38,862 --> 00:00:40,612
burdens upon their backs, and

20
00:00:40,612 --> 00:00:42,209
drive them as they would a dumb ass—

21
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:47,542
4 Yea, all this was

22
00:00:47,542 --> 00:00:52,875
done that the word of the

23
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:58,158
Lord might be fulfilled.

24
00:00:58,158 --> 00:00:58,408
5 And now the

25
00:00:58,408 --> 00:00:58,658
afflictions of the Nephites

26
00:00:58,658 --> 00:00:58,908
were great, and there

27
00:00:58,908 --> 00:00:59,158
was no way that they

28
00:00:59,158 --> 00:00:59,408
could deliver themselves

29
00:00:59,408 --> 00:00:59,658
out of their hands,

30
00:00:59,658 --> 00:00:59,908
for the Lamanites had

31
00:00:59,908 --> 00:01:00,56
surrounded them on every side.

32
00:01:00,56 --> 00:01:02,274
6 And it came to pass

33
00:01:02,274 --> 00:01:03,988
that the people

34
00:01:03,988 --> 00:01:05,703
began to murmur with the

35
00:01:05,703 --> 00:01:07,416
king because of their

36
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:09,13
afflictions; and

37
00:01:09,13 --> 00:01:10,844
they began to be

38
00:01:10,844 --> 00:01:12,558
desirous to go against them

39
00:01:12,558 --> 00:01:14,272
to battle. And they

40
00:01:14,272 --> 00:01:15,986
did afflict the king

41
00:01:15,986 --> 00:01:17,701
sorely with their

42
00:01:17,701 --> 00:01:19,415
complaints; therefore he

43
00:01:19,415 --> 00:01:21,129
granted unto them

44
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:22,843
that they should do

45
00:01:22,843 --> 00:01:24,451
according to their desires.

46
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:26,022
7 And they gathered

47
00:01:26,022 --> 00:01:27,593
themselves together

48
00:01:27,593 --> 00:01:29,164
again, and put on

49
00:01:29,164 --> 00:01:30,735
their armor, and went

50
00:01:30,735 --> 00:01:32,306
forth against the

51
00:01:32,306 --> 00:01:33,877
Lamanites to drive

52
00:01:33,877 --> 00:01:35,862
them out of their land.

53
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:39,062
8 And it came to

54
00:01:39,062 --> 00:01:42,262
pass that the

55
00:01:42,262 --> 00:01:45,462
Lamanites did beat them,

56
00:01:45,462 --> 00:01:48,662
and drove them back,

57
00:01:48,662 --> 00:01:51,311
and slew many of them.

58
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:51,947
9 And now there

59
00:01:51,947 --> 00:01:52,583
was a great mourning

60
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:53,219
and lamentation

61
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:53,855
among the people of

62
00:01:53,855 --> 00:01:54,491
Limhi, the widow

63
00:01:54,491 --> 00:01:55,127
mourning for her

64
00:01:55,127 --> 00:01:55,763
husband, the son

65
00:01:55,763 --> 00:01:56,399
and the daughter

66
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,035
mourning for their

67
00:01:57,035 --> 00:01:57,671
father, and the

68
00:01:57,671 --> 00:01:58,352
brothers for their brethren.

69
00:01:58,352 --> 00:01:59,019
10 Now there

70
00:01:59,019 --> 00:01:59,686
were a great many

71
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:00,353
widows in the

72
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:01,02
land, and they did

73
00:02:01,02 --> 00:02:01,687
cry mightily

74
00:02:01,687 --> 00:02:02,354
from day to day,

75
00:02:02,354 --> 00:02:03,021
for a great fear

76
00:02:03,021 --> 00:02:03,688
of the Lamanites

77
00:02:03,688 --> 00:02:04,691
had come upon them.

78
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:05,334
11 And it came

79
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:05,977
to pass that

80
00:02:05,977 --> 00:02:06,62
their continual

81
00:02:06,62 --> 00:02:07,263
cries did stir

82
00:02:07,263 --> 00:02:07,906
up the remainder

83
00:02:07,906 --> 00:02:08,549
of the people

84
00:02:08,549 --> 00:02:09,192
of Limhi to

85
00:02:09,192 --> 00:02:09,835
anger against the

86
00:02:09,835 --> 00:02:10,478
Lamanites; and

87
00:02:10,478 --> 00:02:11,121
they went again

88
00:02:11,121 --> 00:02:11,764
to battle, but

89
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:12,407
they were

90
00:02:12,407 --> 00:02:13,05
driven back again,

91
00:02:13,05 --> 00:02:13,633
suffering much loss.

92
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:13,733
12 Yea, they

93
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:13,833
went again even

94
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:13,934
the third

95
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:14,034
time, and

96
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:14,133
suffered in the like

97
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:14,233
manner; and

98
00:02:14,233 --> 00:02:14,333
those that were

99
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:14,434
not slain

100
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:14,534
returned again to

101
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:14,101
the city of Nephi.

102
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:14,726
13 And they

103
00:02:14,726 --> 00:02:15,351
did humble

104
00:02:15,351 --> 00:02:15,976
themselves even

105
00:02:15,976 --> 00:02:16,601
to the dust,

106
00:02:16,601 --> 00:02:17,226
subjecting

107
00:02:17,226 --> 00:02:17,851
themselves to

108
00:02:17,851 --> 00:02:18,476
the yoke of

109
00:02:18,476 --> 00:02:19,101
bondage,

110
00:02:19,101 --> 00:02:19,726
submitting

111
00:02:19,726 --> 00:02:20,351
themselves to be

112
00:02:20,351 --> 00:02:20,976
smitten, and to

113
00:02:20,976 --> 00:02:21,601
be driven to

114
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:22,226
and fro, and

115
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:22,851
burdened,

116
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:23,476
according to the

117
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,444
desires of their enemies.

118
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:24,882
14 And they

119
00:02:24,882 --> 00:02:25,32
did humble

120
00:02:25,32 --> 00:02:25,758
themselves

121
00:02:25,758 --> 00:02:26,196
even in the

122
00:02:26,196 --> 00:02:26,634
depths of

123
00:02:26,634 --> 00:02:27,072
humility; and

124
00:02:27,072 --> 00:02:27,51
they did cry

125
00:02:27,51 --> 00:02:27,948
mightily to

126
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:28,386
God; yea,

127
00:02:28,386 --> 00:02:28,824
even all the

128
00:02:28,824 --> 00:02:29,262
day long did

129
00:02:29,262 --> 00:02:29,7
they cry unto

130
00:02:29,7 --> 00:02:30,138
their God

131
00:02:30,138 --> 00:02:30,576
that he would

132
00:02:30,576 --> 00:02:31,014
deliver

133
00:02:31,014 --> 00:02:31,952
them out of their afflictions.

134
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:33,213
15 And now

135
00:02:33,213 --> 00:02:34,474
the Lord

136
00:02:34,474 --> 00:02:35,735
was slow to

137
00:02:35,735 --> 00:02:36,996
hear their

138
00:02:36,996 --> 00:02:38,257
cry because

139
00:02:38,257 --> 00:02:39,518
of their

140
00:02:39,518 --> 00:02:40,779
iniquities;

141
00:02:40,779 --> 00:02:42,04
nevertheless

142
00:02:42,04 --> 00:02:43,301
the Lord

143
00:02:43,301 --> 00:02:44,562
did hear

144
00:02:44,562 --> 00:02:45,823
their cries,

145
00:02:45,823 --> 00:02:47,084
and began to

146
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:48,345
soften the

147
00:02:48,345 --> 00:02:49,606
hearts of

148
00:02:49,606 --> 00:02:50,867
the

149
00:02:50,867 --> 00:02:52,128
Lamanites that

150
00:02:52,128 --> 00:02:53,389
they began to

151
00:02:53,389 --> 00:02:54,65
ease their

152
00:02:54,65 --> 00:02:55,911
burdens;

153
00:02:55,911 --> 00:02:57,172
yet the Lord

154
00:02:57,172 --> 00:02:58,433
did not see

155
00:02:58,433 --> 00:02:59,694
fit to

156
00:02:59,694 --> 00:03:00,28
deliver them out of bondage.

157
00:03:00,28 --> 00:03:01,092
16 And it

158
00:03:01,092 --> 00:03:01,904
came to pass

159
00:03:01,904 --> 00:03:02,716
that they

160
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:03,528
began to

161
00:03:03,528 --> 00:03:04,34
prosper by

162
00:03:04,34 --> 00:03:05,152
degrees in

163
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:05,964
the land, and

164
00:03:05,964 --> 00:03:06,776
began to

165
00:03:06,776 --> 00:03:07,588
raise grain

166
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:08,4
more

167
00:03:08,4 --> 00:03:09,212
abundantly, and

168
00:03:09,212 --> 00:03:10,024
flocks, and

169
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:10,836
herds, that

170
00:03:10,836 --> 00:03:11,648
they did

171
00:03:11,648 --> 00:03:12,46
not suffer

172
00:03:12,46 --> 00:03:13,66
with hunger.

173
00:03:13,66 --> 00:03:13,624
17 Now

174
00:03:13,624 --> 00:03:13,588
there was a

175
00:03:13,588 --> 00:03:13,552
great

176
00:03:13,552 --> 00:03:13,516
number of

177
00:03:13,516 --> 00:03:13,48
women, more

178
00:03:13,48 --> 00:03:13,444
than there

179
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:13,408
was of men;

180
00:03:13,408 --> 00:03:13,372
therefore

181
00:03:13,372 --> 00:03:13,336
king Limhi

182
00:03:13,336 --> 00:03:13,3
commanded

183
00:03:13,3 --> 00:03:13,264
that

184
00:03:13,264 --> 00:03:13,228
every man

185
00:03:13,228 --> 00:03:13,192
should impart

186
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:13,156
to the

187
00:03:13,156 --> 00:03:13,12
support of

188
00:03:13,12 --> 00:03:13,084
the widows

189
00:03:13,084 --> 00:03:13,048
and their

190
00:03:13,048 --> 00:03:13,012
children,

191
00:03:13,012 --> 00:03:12,976
that they

192
00:03:12,976 --> 00:03:12,94
might not

193
00:03:12,94 --> 00:03:12,904
perish with

194
00:03:12,904 --> 00:03:12,868
hunger;

195
00:03:12,868 --> 00:03:12,832
and this

196
00:03:12,832 --> 00:03:12,796
they did

197
00:03:12,796 --> 00:03:12,76
because of

198
00:03:12,76 --> 00:03:12,724
the

199
00:03:12,724 --> 00:03:12,688
greatness of their

200
00:03:12,688 --> 00:03:12,726
number that had been slain.

201
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:13,143
18 Now the

202
00:03:13,143 --> 00:03:13,56
people of

203
00:03:13,56 --> 00:03:13,977
Limhi

204
00:03:13,977 --> 00:03:14,394
kept together

205

206
00:03:14,811 --> 00:03:15,228
as much

207
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:15,645
as it was

208
00:03:15,645 --> 00:03:16,062
possible,

209
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:16,479
and secured

210
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:16,896
their

211
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:17,313
grain and

212
00:03:17,313 --> 00:03:17,664
their flocks;

213
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:17,717
19 And

214
00:03:17,717 --> 00:03:17,77
the king

215
00:03:17,77 --> 00:03:17,823
himself did

216
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:17,876
not

217
00:03:17,876 --> 00:03:17,929
trust his

218
00:03:17,929 --> 00:03:17,982
person

219
00:03:17,982 --> 00:03:18,035
without the

220
00:03:18,035 --> 00:03:18,088
walls of

221
00:03:18,088 --> 00:03:18,141
the city,

222
00:03:18,141 --> 00:03:18,194
unless he

223
00:03:18,194 --> 00:03:18,247
took his

224
00:03:18,247 --> 00:03:18,3
guards

225
00:03:18,3 --> 00:03:18,353
with him,

226
00:03:18,353 --> 00:03:18,406
fearing

227
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:18,459
that he

228
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:18,512
might by

229
00:03:18,512 --> 00:03:18,565
some means

230
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:18,618
fall into

231
00:03:18,618 --> 00:03:18,131
the hands of the Lamanites.

232
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:18,097
20 And

233
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:18,063
he caused

234
00:03:18,063 --> 00:03:18,029
that

235
00:03:18,029 --> 00:03:17,995
his people

236
00:03:17,995 --> 00:03:17,961
should

237
00:03:17,961 --> 00:03:17,927
watch

238
00:03:17,927 --> 00:03:17,893

239
00:03:17,893 --> 00:03:17,859

240
00:03:17,859 --> 00:03:17,825

241
00:03:17,825 --> 00:03:17,791
by some

242
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:17,757
means

243
00:03:17,757 --> 00:03:17,723
they

244
00:03:17,723 --> 00:03:17,689
might take

245
00:03:17,689 --> 00:03:17,655
those

246
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:17,621
priests

247
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:17,587

248
00:03:17,587 --> 00:03:17,553
into the

00:03:17,553 --> 00:03:17,519


250
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:17,485
wilderness, who

251
00:03:17,485 --> 00:03:17,451
had

252
00:03:17,451 --> 00:03:17,417
stolen the

253
00:03:17,417 --> 00:03:17,383
daughters

254
00:03:17,383 --> 00:03:17,349

256
00:03:17,315 --> 00:03:17,281
Lamanites, and

257
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:17,247
that had

258
00:03:17,247 --> 00:03:17,213
caused

259
00:03:17,213 --> 00:03:17,179
such a

260
00:03:17,179 --> 00:03:17,197
great destruction to come upon them.

261
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:17,16
21 For

262
00:03:17,16 --> 00:03:17,123
they were

263
00:03:17,123 --> 00:03:17,086


264
00:03:17,086 --> 00:03:17,049
desirous to

265
00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:17,012
take them

266
00:03:17,012 --> 00:03:16,975
that they

267
00:03:16,975 --> 00:03:16,938
might

268
00:03:16,938 --> 00:03:16,901
punish

269
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:16,864
them; for

270
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:16,827
they had

271
00:03:16,827 --> 00:03:16,79
come

272
00:03:16,79 --> 00:03:16,753
into the

273
00:03:16,753 --> 00:03:16,716

276
00:03:16,642 --> 00:03:16,605
and

277
00:03:16,605 --> 00:03:16,568
carried off

278
00:03:16,568 --> 00:03:16,531

things;

284
00:03:16,346 --> 00:03:16,309
therefore

285
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:16,272
they

286
00:03:16,272 --> 00:03:16,235

00:03:16,235 --> 00:03:16,263
for them.

288
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:16,399
22 And

289
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:16,535
it came

290
00:03:16,535 --> 00:03:16,671

And had

death.

356
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:33,635
24 But

357
00:03:33,635 --> 00:03:34,157
when
