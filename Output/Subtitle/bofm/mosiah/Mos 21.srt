00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:05,75
Chapter 21 Limhi’s people are smitten and defeated

2
00:00:05,75 --> 00:00:11,5
 by the Lamanites—Limhi’s people meet Ammon and

3
00:00:11,5 --> 00:00:17,25
 are converted—They tell Ammon of the twenty-four

4
00:00:17,25 --> 00:00:23,0
 Jaredite plates. About 122–121 B.C.

5
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:26,591
1 And it came to pass that Limhi and his people

6
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:29,258
 returned to the city of Nephi, and began to dwell in

7
00:00:29,258 --> 00:00:31,925
 the land again in peace

8
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,899
2 And it came to pass that after many days the

9
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,899
 Lamanites began again to be stirred up in anger

10
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:37,899
 against the Nephites, and they began to come into the

11
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:39,899
 borders of the land round about

12
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,206
3 Now they durst not slay them, because of the

13
00:00:41,206 --> 00:00:42,539
 oath which their king had made unto Limhi; but they

14
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:43,872
 would smite them on their cheeks, and exercise

15
00:00:43,872 --> 00:00:45,205
 authority over them; and began to put heavy burdens

16
00:00:45,205 --> 00:00:46,538
 upon their backs, and drive them as they would a

17
00:00:46,538 --> 00:00:47,871
 dumb ass

18
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:51,848
4 Yea, all this was done that the word of the Lord

19
00:00:51,848 --> 00:00:55,848
 might be fulfilled

20
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,822
5 And now the afflictions of the Nephites were

21
00:00:57,822 --> 00:00:59,822
 great, and there was no way that they could deliver

22
00:00:59,822 --> 00:01:01,822
 themselves out of their hands, for the Lamanites

23
00:01:01,822 --> 00:01:03,822
 had surrounded them on every side

24
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,13
6 And it came to pass that the people began to

25
00:01:05,13 --> 00:01:06,463
 murmur with the king because of their afflictions;

26
00:01:06,463 --> 00:01:07,796
 and they began to be desirous to go against them to

27
00:01:07,796 --> 00:01:09,129
 battle. And they did afflict the king sorely with

28
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:10,462
 their complaints; therefore he granted unto them

29
00:01:10,462 --> 00:01:11,795
 that they should do according to their desires

30
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:14,439
7 And they gathered themselves together again, and

31
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:17,106
 put on their armor, and went forth against the

32
00:01:17,106 --> 00:01:19,773
 Lamanites to drive them out of their land

33
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:23,746
8 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did beat

34
00:01:23,746 --> 00:01:27,746
 them, and drove them back, and slew many of them

35
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:29,321
9 And now there was a great mourning and

36
00:01:29,321 --> 00:01:30,921
 lamentation among the people of Limhi, the widow mourning

37
00:01:30,921 --> 00:01:32,521
 for her husband, the son and the daughter mourning

38
00:01:32,521 --> 00:01:34,121
 for their father, and the brothers for their

39
00:01:34,121 --> 00:01:35,721
 brethren

40
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:38,363
10 Now there were a great many widows in the land,

41
00:01:38,363 --> 00:01:41,03
 and they did cry mightily from day to day, for a

42
00:01:41,03 --> 00:01:43,697
 great fear of the Lamanites had come upon them

43
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:45,27
11 And it came to pass that their continual cries

44
00:01:45,27 --> 00:01:46,87
 did stir up the remainder of the people of Limhi

45
00:01:46,87 --> 00:01:48,47
 to anger against the Lamanites; and they went again

46
00:01:48,47 --> 00:01:50,07
 to battle, but they were driven back again,

47
00:01:50,07 --> 00:01:51,67
 suffering much loss

48
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:54,312
12 Yea, they went again even the third time, and

49
00:01:54,312 --> 00:01:56,979
 suffered in the like manner; and those that were

50
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:59,646
 not slain returned again to the city of Nephi

51
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:01,219
13 And they did humble themselves even to the

52
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:02,82
 dust, subjecting themselves to the yoke of bondage,

53
00:02:02,82 --> 00:02:04,419
 submitting themselves to be smitten, and to be

54
00:02:04,419 --> 00:02:06,02
 driven to and fro, and burdened, according to the

55
00:02:06,02 --> 00:02:07,62
 desires of their enemies

56
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,194
14 And they did humble themselves even in the

57
00:02:09,194 --> 00:02:10,794
 depths of humility; and they did cry mightily to God;

58
00:02:10,794 --> 00:02:12,394
 yea, even all the day long did they cry unto their

59
00:02:12,394 --> 00:02:13,994
 God that he would deliver them out of their

60
00:02:13,994 --> 00:02:15,594
 afflictions

61
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:16,902
15 And now the Lord was slow to hear their cry

62
00:02:16,902 --> 00:02:18,235
 because of their iniquities; nevertheless the Lord

63
00:02:18,235 --> 00:02:19,568
 did hear their cries, and began to soften the hearts

64
00:02:19,568 --> 00:02:20,901
 of the Lamanites that they began to ease their

65
00:02:20,901 --> 00:02:22,234
 burdens; yet the Lord did not see fit to deliver

66
00:02:22,234 --> 00:02:23,567
 them out of bondage

67
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,543
16 And it came to pass that they began to prosper

68
00:02:25,543 --> 00:02:27,543
 by degrees in the land, and began to raise grain

69
00:02:27,543 --> 00:02:29,543
 more abundantly, and flocks, and herds, that they

70
00:02:29,543 --> 00:02:31,543
 did not suffer with hunger

71
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:32,851
17 Now there was a great number of women, more

72
00:02:32,851 --> 00:02:34,184
 than there was of men; therefore king Limhi commanded

73
00:02:34,184 --> 00:02:35,517
 that every man should impart to the support of

74
00:02:35,517 --> 00:02:36,85
 the widows and their children, that they might not

75
00:02:36,85 --> 00:02:38,183
 perish with hunger; and this they did because of

76
00:02:38,183 --> 00:02:39,516
 the greatness of their number that had been slain

77
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:42,16
18 Now the people of Limhi kept together in a body

78
00:02:42,16 --> 00:02:44,827
 as much as it was possible, and secured their

79
00:02:44,827 --> 00:02:47,494
 grain and their flocks

80
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,467
19 And the king himself did not trust his person

81
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:51,467
 without the walls of the city, unless he took his

82
00:02:51,467 --> 00:02:53,467
 guards with him, fearing that he might by some

83
00:02:53,467 --> 00:02:55,467
 means fall into the hands of the Lamanites

84
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:56,775
20 And he caused that his people should watch the

85
00:02:56,775 --> 00:02:58,108
 land round about, that by some means they might

86
00:02:58,108 --> 00:02:59,441
 take those priests that fled into the wilderness,

87
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:00,774
 who had stolen the daughters of the Lamanites, and

88
00:03:00,774 --> 00:03:02,107
 that had caused such a great destruction to come

89
00:03:02,107 --> 00:03:03,44
 upon them

90
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,017
21 For they were desirous to take them that they

91
00:03:05,017 --> 00:03:06,617
 might punish them; for they had come into the land

92
00:03:06,617 --> 00:03:08,217
 of Nephi by night, and carried off their grain and

93
00:03:08,217 --> 00:03:09,817
 many of their precious things; therefore they

94
00:03:09,817 --> 00:03:11,417
 laid wait for them

95
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,391
22 And it came to pass that there was no more

96
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:15,391
 disturbance between the Lamanites and the people of

97
00:03:15,391 --> 00:03:17,391
 Limhi, even until the time that Ammon and his

98
00:03:17,391 --> 00:03:19,391
 brethren came into the land

99
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,509
23 And the king having been without the gates of

100
00:03:20,509 --> 00:03:21,652
 the city with his guard, discovered Ammon and his

101
00:03:21,652 --> 00:03:22,795
 brethren; and supposing them to be priests of Noah

102
00:03:22,795 --> 00:03:23,938
 therefore he caused that they should be taken, and

103
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:25,081
 bound, and cast into prison. And had they been

104
00:03:25,081 --> 00:03:26,224
 the priests of Noah he would have caused that they

105
00:03:26,224 --> 00:03:27,367
 should be put to death

106
00:03:27,34 --> 00:03:29,34
24 But when he found that they were not, but that

107
00:03:29,34 --> 00:03:31,34
 they were his brethren, and had come from the land

108
00:03:31,34 --> 00:03:33,34
 of Zarahemla, he was filled with exceedingly

109
00:03:33,34 --> 00:03:35,34
 great joy

110
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,315
25 Now king Limhi had sent, previous to the coming

111
00:03:37,315 --> 00:03:39,315
 of Ammon, a small number of men to search for the

112
00:03:39,315 --> 00:03:41,315
 land of Zarahemla; but they could not find it,

113
00:03:41,315 --> 00:03:43,315
 and they were lost in the wilderness

114
00:03:43,29 --> 00:03:44,433
26 Nevertheless, they did find a land which had

115
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:45,576
 been peopled; yea, a land which was covered with dry

116
00:03:45,576 --> 00:03:46,719
 bones; yea, a land which had been peopled and

117
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:47,862
 which had been destroyed; and they, having supposed

118
00:03:47,862 --> 00:03:49,005
 it to be the land of Zarahemla, returned to the

119
00:03:49,005 --> 00:03:50,148
 land of Nephi, having arrived in the borders of the

120
00:03:50,148 --> 00:03:51,291
 land not many days before the coming of Ammon

121
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,931
27 And they brought a record with them, even a

122
00:03:53,931 --> 00:03:56,598
 record of the people whose bones they had found; and

123
00:03:56,598 --> 00:03:59,265
 it was engraven on plates of ore

124
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,239
28 And now Limhi was again filled with joy on

125
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:03,239
 learning from the mouth of Ammon that king Mosiah had

126
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,239
 a gift from God, whereby he could interpret such

127
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:07,239
 engravings; yea, and Ammon also did rejoice

128
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:09,881
29 Yet Ammon and his brethren were filled with

129
00:04:09,881 --> 00:04:12,548
 sorrow because so many of their brethren had been

130
00:04:12,548 --> 00:04:15,215
 slain

131
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,188
30 And also that king Noah and his priests had

132
00:04:16,188 --> 00:04:17,188
 caused the people to commit so many sins and

133
00:04:17,188 --> 00:04:18,188
 iniquities against God; and they also did mourn for the

134
00:04:18,188 --> 00:04:19,188
 death of Abinadi; and also for the departure of Alma

135
00:04:19,188 --> 00:04:20,188
 and the people that went with him, who had formed

136
00:04:20,188 --> 00:04:21,188
 a church of God through the strength and power of

137
00:04:21,188 --> 00:04:22,188
 God, and faith on the words which had been spoken

138
00:04:22,188 --> 00:04:23,188
 by Abinadi

139
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:24,763
31 Yea, they did mourn for their departure, for

140
00:04:24,763 --> 00:04:26,363
 they knew not whither they had fled. Now they would

141
00:04:26,363 --> 00:04:27,963
 have gladly joined with them, for they themselves

142
00:04:27,963 --> 00:04:29,563
 had entered into a covenant with God to serve him

143
00:04:29,563 --> 00:04:31,163
 and keep his commandments

144
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:33,138
32 And now since the coming of Ammon, king Limhi

145
00:04:33,138 --> 00:04:35,138
 had also entered into a covenant with God, and also

146
00:04:35,138 --> 00:04:37,138
 many of his people, to serve him and keep his

147
00:04:37,138 --> 00:04:39,138
 commandments

148
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,712
33 And it came to pass that king Limhi and many of

149
00:04:40,712 --> 00:04:42,312
 his people were desirous to be baptized; but

150
00:04:42,312 --> 00:04:43,912
 there was none in the land that had authority from

151
00:04:43,912 --> 00:04:45,512
 God. And Ammon declined doing this thing, considering

152
00:04:45,512 --> 00:04:47,112
 himself an unworthy servant

153
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:48,687
34 Therefore they did not at that time form

154
00:04:48,687 --> 00:04:50,287
 themselves into a church, waiting upon the Spirit of the

155
00:04:50,287 --> 00:04:51,887
 Lord. Now they were desirous to become even as

156
00:04:51,887 --> 00:04:53,487
 Alma and his brethren, who had fled into the

157
00:04:53,487 --> 00:04:55,087
 wilderness

158
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,661
35 They were desirous to be baptized as a witness

159
00:04:56,661 --> 00:04:58,261
 and a testimony that they were willing to serve

160
00:04:58,261 --> 00:04:59,861
 God with all their hearts; nevertheless they did

161
00:04:59,861 --> 00:05:01,461
 prolong the time; and an account of their baptism

162
00:05:01,461 --> 00:05:03,061
 shall be given hereafter

163
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,536
36 And now all the study of Ammon and his people,

164
00:05:04,536 --> 00:05:06,036
 and king Limhi and his people, was to deliver

165
00:05:06,036 --> 00:05:07,536
 themselves out of the hands of the Lamanites and from

166
00:05:07,536 --> 00:05:09,036
 bondage.
