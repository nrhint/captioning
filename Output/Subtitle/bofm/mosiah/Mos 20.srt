00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,75
Chapter 20 Some Lamanite daughters are abducted by

2
00:00:01,75 --> 00:00:03,5
 the priests of Noah—The Lamanites wage war upon

3
00:00:03,5 --> 00:00:05,25
 Limhi and his people—The Lamanite hosts are

4
00:00:05,25 --> 00:00:07,0
 repulsed and pacified. About 145–123 B.C.

5
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,975
1 Now there was a place in Shemlon where the

6
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:11,975
 daughters of the Lamanites did gather themselves

7
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:13,975
 together to sing, and to dance, and to make themselves

8
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:15,975
 merry

9
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,616
2 And it came to pass that there was one day a

10
00:00:18,616 --> 00:00:21,283
 small number of them gathered together to sing and to

11
00:00:21,283 --> 00:00:23,95
 dance

12
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,524
3 And now the priests of king Noah, being ashamed

13
00:00:25,524 --> 00:00:27,124
 to return to the city of Nephi, yea, and also

14
00:00:27,124 --> 00:00:28,724
 fearing that the people would slay them, therefore

15
00:00:28,724 --> 00:00:30,324
 they durst not return to their wives and their

16
00:00:30,324 --> 00:00:31,924
 children

17
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:37,232
4 And having tarried in the wilderness, and having

18
00:00:37,232 --> 00:00:42,565
 discovered the daughters of the Lamanites, they

19
00:00:42,565 --> 00:00:47,898
 laid and watched them

20
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,448
5 And when there were but few of them gathered

21
00:00:49,448 --> 00:00:51,048
 together to dance, they came forth out of their

22
00:00:51,048 --> 00:00:52,648
 secret places and took them and carried them into the

23
00:00:52,648 --> 00:00:54,248
 wilderness; yea, twenty and four of the daughters

24
00:00:54,248 --> 00:00:55,848
 of the Lamanites they carried into the wilderness

25
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,822
6 And it came to pass that when the Lamanites

26
00:00:57,822 --> 00:00:59,822
 found that their daughters had been missing, they were

27
00:00:59,822 --> 00:01:01,822
 angry with the people of Limhi, for they thought

28
00:01:01,822 --> 00:01:03,822
 it was the people of Limhi

29
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,797
7 Therefore they sent their armies forth; yea,

30
00:01:05,797 --> 00:01:07,797
 even the king himself went before his people; and

31
00:01:07,797 --> 00:01:09,797
 they went up to the land of Nephi to destroy the

32
00:01:09,797 --> 00:01:11,797
 people of Limhi

33
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:13,372
8 And now Limhi had discovered them from the

34
00:01:13,372 --> 00:01:14,972
 tower, even all their preparations for war did he

35
00:01:14,972 --> 00:01:16,572
 discover; therefore he gathered his people together,

36
00:01:16,572 --> 00:01:18,172
 and laid wait for them in the fields and in the

37
00:01:18,172 --> 00:01:19,772
 forests

38
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,746
9 And it came to pass that when the Lamanites had

39
00:01:21,746 --> 00:01:23,746
 come up, that the people of Limhi began to fall

40
00:01:23,746 --> 00:01:25,746
 upon them from their waiting places, and began to

41
00:01:25,746 --> 00:01:27,746
 slay them

42
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:30,388
10 And it came to pass that the battle became

43
00:01:30,388 --> 00:01:33,055
 exceedingly sore, for they fought like lions for their

44
00:01:33,055 --> 00:01:35,722
 prey

45
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,029
11 And it came to pass that the people of Limhi

46
00:01:37,029 --> 00:01:38,362
 began to drive the Lamanites before them; yet they

47
00:01:38,362 --> 00:01:39,695
 were not half so numerous as the Lamanites. But

48
00:01:39,695 --> 00:01:41,028
 they fought for their lives, and for their wives, and

49
00:01:41,028 --> 00:01:42,361
 for their children; therefore they exerted

50
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:43,694
 themselves and like dragons did they fight

51
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:45,27
12 And it came to pass that they found the king of

52
00:01:45,27 --> 00:01:46,87
 the Lamanites among the number of their dead; yet

53
00:01:46,87 --> 00:01:48,47
 he was not dead, having been wounded and left

54
00:01:48,47 --> 00:01:50,07
 upon the ground, so speedy was the flight of his

55
00:01:50,07 --> 00:01:51,67
 people

56
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:52,978
13 And they took him and bound up his wounds, and

57
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:54,311
 brought him before Limhi, and said: Behold, here

58
00:01:54,311 --> 00:01:55,644
 is the king of the Lamanites; he having received a

59
00:01:55,644 --> 00:01:56,977
 wound has fallen among their dead, and they have

60
00:01:56,977 --> 00:01:58,31
 left him; and behold, we have brought him before

61
00:01:58,31 --> 00:01:59,643
 you; and now let us slay him

62
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:00,763
14 But Limhi said unto them: Ye shall not slay

63
00:02:00,763 --> 00:02:01,906
 him, but bring him hither that I may see him. And

64
00:02:01,906 --> 00:02:03,049
 they brought him. And Limhi said unto him: What cause

65
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:04,192
 have ye to come up to war against my people?

66
00:02:04,192 --> 00:02:05,335
 Behold, my people have not broken the oath that I made

67
00:02:05,335 --> 00:02:06,478
 unto you; therefore, why should ye break the oath

68
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:07,621
 which ye made unto my people

69
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,594
15 And now the king said: I have broken the oath

70
00:02:09,594 --> 00:02:11,594
 because thy people did carry away the daughters of

71
00:02:11,594 --> 00:02:13,594
 my people; therefore, in my anger I did cause my

72
00:02:13,594 --> 00:02:15,594
 people to come up to war against thy people

73
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:17,169
16 And now Limhi had heard nothing concerning this

74
00:02:17,169 --> 00:02:18,769
 matter; therefore he said: I will search among my

75
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:20,369
 people and whosoever has done this thing shall

76
00:02:20,369 --> 00:02:21,969
 perish. Therefore he caused a search to be made

77
00:02:21,969 --> 00:02:23,569
 among his people

78
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,143
17 Now when Gideon had heard these things, he

79
00:02:25,143 --> 00:02:26,743
 being the king’s captain, he went forth and said unto

80
00:02:26,743 --> 00:02:28,343
 the king: I pray thee forbear, and do not search

81
00:02:28,343 --> 00:02:29,943
 this people, and lay not this thing to their

82
00:02:29,943 --> 00:02:31,543
 charge

83
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,518
18 For do ye not remember the priests of thy

84
00:02:33,518 --> 00:02:35,518
 father, whom this people sought to destroy? And are

85
00:02:35,518 --> 00:02:37,518
 they not in the wilderness? And are not they the ones

86
00:02:37,518 --> 00:02:39,518
 who have stolen the daughters of the Lamanites

87
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:42,693
19 And now, behold, and tell the king of these

88
00:02:42,693 --> 00:02:45,893
 things, that he may tell his people that they may be

89
00:02:45,893 --> 00:02:49,093
 pacified towards us; for behold they are already

90
00:02:49,093 --> 00:02:52,293
 preparing to come against us; and behold also there

91
00:02:52,293 --> 00:02:55,493
 are but few of us

92
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:58,109
20 And behold, they come with their numerous

93
00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:00,776
 hosts; and except the king doth pacify them towards us

94
00:03:00,776 --> 00:03:03,443
 we must perish

95
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,417
21 For are not the words of Abinadi fulfilled,

96
00:03:05,417 --> 00:03:07,417
 which he prophesied against us—and all this because

97
00:03:07,417 --> 00:03:09,417
 we would not hearken unto the words of the Lord,

98
00:03:09,417 --> 00:03:11,417
 and turn from our iniquities

99
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:12,991
22 And now let us pacify the king, and we fulfil

100
00:03:12,991 --> 00:03:14,591
 the oath which we have made unto him; for it is

101
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:16,191
 better that we should be in bondage than that we

102
00:03:16,191 --> 00:03:17,791
 should lose our lives; therefore, let us put a stop to

103
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,391
 the shedding of so much blood

104
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,366
23 And now Limhi told the king all the things

105
00:03:21,366 --> 00:03:23,366
 concerning his father, and the priests that had fled

106
00:03:23,366 --> 00:03:25,366
 into the wilderness, and attributed the carrying

107
00:03:25,366 --> 00:03:27,366
 away of their daughters to them

108
00:03:27,34 --> 00:03:28,94
24 And it came to pass that the king was pacified

109
00:03:28,94 --> 00:03:30,54
 towards his people; and he said unto them: Let us

110
00:03:30,54 --> 00:03:32,14
 go forth to meet my people, without arms; and I

111
00:03:32,14 --> 00:03:33,74
 swear unto you with an oath that my people shall not

112
00:03:33,74 --> 00:03:35,34
 slay thy people

113
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:36,648
25 And it came to pass that they followed the

114
00:03:36,648 --> 00:03:37,981
 king, and went forth without arms to meet the

115
00:03:37,981 --> 00:03:39,314
 Lamanites. And it came to pass that they did meet the

116
00:03:39,314 --> 00:03:40,647
 Lamanites; and the king of the Lamanites did bow

117
00:03:40,647 --> 00:03:41,98
 himself down before them, and did plead in behalf of

118
00:03:41,98 --> 00:03:43,313
 the people of Limhi

119
00:03:43,29 --> 00:03:45,29
26 And when the Lamanites saw the people of Limhi,

120
00:03:45,29 --> 00:03:47,29
 that they were without arms, they had compassion

121
00:03:47,29 --> 00:03:49,29
 on them and were pacified towards them, and

122
00:03:49,29 --> 00:03:51,29
 returned with their king in peace to their own land.
