00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 20 Some Lamanite daughters are

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
abducted by the priests of Noah—The Lamanites wage

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
war upon Limhi and his people—The Lamanite hosts

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:04:29,
are repulsed and pacified. About 145–123 B.C. 

5
00:04:29,0 --> 00:04:29,0
1 Now there was a place in Shemlon

6
00:04:29,0 --> 00:04:29,0
where the daughters of the Lamanites did

7
00:04:29,0 --> 00:04:29,0
gather themselves together to sing,

8
00:04:29,0 --> 00:10:11,
and to dance, and to make themselves merry.

9
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
2 And it came to pass that there

10
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
was one day a small number of them

11
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,
gathered together to sing and to dance.

12
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
3 And now the priests of king

13
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
Noah, being ashamed to return to the

14
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
city of Nephi, yea, and also

15
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
fearing that the people would slay

16
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
them, therefore they durst not

17
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,
return to their wives and their children.

18
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
4 And having tarried in the

19
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
wilderness, and having

20
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
discovered the daughters of the

21
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,
Lamanites, they laid and watched them;

22
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
5 And when there were but

23
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
few of them gathered

24
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
together to dance, they came forth

25
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
out of their secret places

26
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
and took them and carried

27
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
them into the wilderness;

28
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
yea, twenty and four of the

29
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
daughters of the Lamanites

30
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,
they carried into the wilderness.

31
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
6 And it came to pass

32
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
that when the Lamanites

33
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
found that their daughters

34
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
had been missing, they were

35
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
angry with the people of

36
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
Limhi, for they thought

37
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,
it was the people of Limhi.

38
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
7 Therefore they sent

39
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
their armies forth; yea,

40
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
even the king himself

41
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
went before his people;

42
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
and they went up to

43
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
the land of Nephi to

44
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,
destroy the people of Limhi.

45
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
8 And now Limhi had

46
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
discovered them from the

47
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
tower, even all their

48
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
preparations for war

49
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
did he discover;

50
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
therefore he gathered his

51
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
people together, and

52
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
laid wait for them in

53
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,
the fields and in the forests.

54
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
9 And it came to

55
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
pass that when the

56
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
Lamanites had come

57
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
up, that the people

58
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
of Limhi began to

59
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
fall upon them from

60
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
their waiting

61
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,
places, and began to slay them.

62
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
10 And it came to

63
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
pass that the

64
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
battle became

65
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
exceedingly sore, for

66
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
they fought like

67
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,
lions for their prey.

68
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
11 And it came

69
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
to pass that the

70
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
people of Limhi

71
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
began to drive

72
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
the Lamanites

73
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
before them; yet

74
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
they were not half

75
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
so numerous as

76
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
the Lamanites.

77
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
But they fought

78
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
for their lives,

79
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
and for their

80
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
wives, and for

81
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
their children;

82
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
therefore they

83
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
exerted themselves

84
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,
and like dragons did they fight.

85
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
12 And it came

86
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
to pass that

87
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
they found the

88
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
king of the

89
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
Lamanites among the

90
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
number of their

91
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
dead; yet he

92
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
was not dead,

93
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
having been

94
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
wounded and left

95
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
upon the ground,

96
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
so speedy was

97
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,
the flight of his people.

98
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
13 And they

99
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
took him and

100
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
bound up his

101
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
wounds, and

102
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
brought him before

103
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
Limhi, and

104
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
said: Behold, here

105
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
is the king

106
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
of the

107
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
Lamanites; he having

108
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
received a

109
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
wound has fallen

110
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
among their

111
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
dead, and they

112
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
have left him;

113
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
and behold, we

114
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
have brought

115
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
him before you;

116
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,
and now let us slay him.

117
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
14 But Limhi

118
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
said unto

119
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
them: Ye shall

120
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
not slay him,

121
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
but bring him

122
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
hither that

123
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
I may see

124
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
him. And they

125
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
brought him.

126
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
And Limhi said

127
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
unto him:

128
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
What cause have

129
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
ye to come up

130
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
to war

131
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
against my people?

132
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
Behold, my

133
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
people have

134
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
not broken the

135
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
oath that I

136
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
made unto you;

137
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
therefore,

138
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
why should ye

139
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
break the

140
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,
oath which ye made unto my people?

141
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
15 And now

142
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
the king

143
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
said: I have

144
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
broken the oath

145
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
because thy

146
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
people did

147
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
carry away

148
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
the daughters

149
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
of my

150
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
people;

151
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
therefore, in my

152
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
anger I did

153
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
cause my people

154
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
to come up

155
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,
to war against thy people.

156
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
16 And now

157
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
Limhi had

158
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
heard

159
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
nothing

160
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
concerning this

161
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
matter;

162
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
therefore he said:

163
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
I will

164
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
search among

165
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
my people

166
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
and whosoever

167
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
has done

168
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
this thing

169
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
shall

170
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
perish. Therefore

171
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
he caused

172
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
a search to

173
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,
be made among his people.

174
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
17 Now

175
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
when Gideon

176
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
had heard

177
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
these

178
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
things, he

179
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
being the

180
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
king’s

181
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
captain, he went

182
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
forth and

183
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
said unto

184
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
the king:

185
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
I pray

186
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
thee forbear,

187
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
and do

188
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
not search

189
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
this

190
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
people, and lay

191
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
not this

192
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,
thing to their charge.

193
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
18 For do

194
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
ye not

195
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
remember

196
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
the

197
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
priests of thy

198
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
father,

199
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
whom this

200
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
people

201
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
sought to

202
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
destroy?

203
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
And are

204
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
they not in

205
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
the

206
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
wilderness?

207
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
And are

208
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
not they

209
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
the ones

210
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
who have

211
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
stolen the

212
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,
daughters of the Lamanites?

213
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
19 And

214
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
now,

215
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
behold, and

216
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
tell the

217
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
king of

218
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
these

219
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
things,

220
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
that he

221
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
may tell

222
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
his

223
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
people that

224
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
