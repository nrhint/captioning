00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:05,25
Chapter 20 Some Lamanite daughters are

2
00:00:05,25 --> 00:00:10,5
abducted by the priests of Noah—The Lamanites wage

3
00:00:10,5 --> 00:00:15,75
war upon Limhi and his people—The Lamanite hosts

4
00:00:15,75 --> 00:00:21,822
are repulsed and pacified. About 145–123 B.C. 

5
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:25,322
1 Now there was a place in Shemlon

6
00:00:25,322 --> 00:00:28,822
where the daughters of the Lamanites did

7
00:00:28,822 --> 00:00:32,322
gather themselves together to sing,

8
00:00:32,322 --> 00:00:35,669
and to dance, and to make themselves merry.

9
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:36,336
2 And it came to pass that there

10
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:37,003
was one day a small number of them

11
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:37,604
gathered together to sing and to dance.

12
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:37,437
3 And now the priests of king

13
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:37,27
Noah, being ashamed to return to the

14
00:00:37,27 --> 00:00:37,103
city of Nephi, yea, and also

15
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:36,936
fearing that the people would slay

16
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:36,769
them, therefore they durst not

17
00:00:36,769 --> 00:00:36,67
return to their wives and their children.

18
00:00:36,67 --> 00:00:36,42
4 And having tarried in the

19
00:00:36,42 --> 00:00:36,17
wilderness, and having

20
00:00:36,17 --> 00:00:35,92
discovered the daughters of the

21
00:00:35,92 --> 00:00:35,736
Lamanites, they laid and watched them;

22
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:35,625
5 And when there were but

23
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:35,514
few of them gathered

24
00:00:35,514 --> 00:00:35,403
together to dance, they came forth

25
00:00:35,403 --> 00:00:35,292
out of their secret places

26
00:00:35,292 --> 00:00:35,181
and took them and carried

27
00:00:35,181 --> 00:00:35,07
them into the wilderness;

28
00:00:35,07 --> 00:00:34,959
yea, twenty and four of the

29
00:00:34,959 --> 00:00:34,848
daughters of the Lamanites

30
00:00:34,848 --> 00:00:34,801
they carried into the wilderness.

31
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:34,658
6 And it came to pass

32
00:00:34,658 --> 00:00:34,515
that when the Lamanites

33
00:00:34,515 --> 00:00:34,372
found that their daughters

34
00:00:34,372 --> 00:00:34,229
had been missing, they were

35
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:34,086
angry with the people of

36
00:00:34,086 --> 00:00:33,943
Limhi, for they thought

37
00:00:33,943 --> 00:00:33,867
it was the people of Limhi.

38
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:34,438
7 Therefore they sent

39
00:00:34,438 --> 00:00:35,009
their armies forth; yea,

40
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:35,58
even the king himself

41
00:00:35,58 --> 00:00:36,151
went before his people;

42
00:00:36,151 --> 00:00:36,722
and they went up to

43
00:00:36,722 --> 00:00:37,293
the land of Nephi to

44
00:00:37,293 --> 00:00:37,337
destroy the people of Limhi.

45
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:37,226
8 And now Limhi had

46
00:00:37,226 --> 00:00:37,115
discovered them from the

47
00:00:37,115 --> 00:00:37,004
tower, even all their

48
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:36,893
preparations for war

49
00:00:36,893 --> 00:00:36,782
did he discover;

50
00:00:36,782 --> 00:00:36,671
therefore he gathered his

51
00:00:36,671 --> 00:00:36,56
people together, and

52
00:00:36,56 --> 00:00:36,449
laid wait for them in

53
00:00:36,449 --> 00:00:36,403
the fields and in the forests.

54
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:36,278
9 And it came to

55
00:00:36,278 --> 00:00:36,153
pass that when the

56
00:00:36,153 --> 00:00:36,028
Lamanites had come

57
00:00:36,028 --> 00:00:35,903
up, that the people

58
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:35,778
of Limhi began to

59
00:00:35,778 --> 00:00:35,653
fall upon them from

60
00:00:35,653 --> 00:00:35,528
their waiting

61
00:00:35,528 --> 00:00:35,469
places, and began to slay them.

62
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
10 And it came to

63
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
pass that the

64
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
battle became

65
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
exceedingly sore, for

66
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
they fought like

67
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
lions for their prey.

68
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
11 And it came

69
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
to pass that the

70
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
people of Limhi

71
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
began to drive

72
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
the Lamanites

73
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
before them; yet

74
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
they were not half

75
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
so numerous as

76
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
the Lamanites.

77
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
But they fought

78
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
for their lives,

79
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
and for their

80
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
wives, and for

81
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
their children;

82
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
therefore they

83
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
exerted themselves

84
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
and like dragons did they fight.

85
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
12 And it came

86
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
to pass that

87
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
they found the

88
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
king of the

89
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
Lamanites among the

90
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
number of their

91
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
dead; yet he

92
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
was not dead,

93
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
having been

94
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
wounded and left

95
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
upon the ground,

96
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
so speedy was

97
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
the flight of his people.

98
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
13 And they

99
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
took him and

100
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
bound up his

101
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
wounds, and

102
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
brought him before

103
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
Limhi, and

104
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
said: Behold, here

105
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
is the king

106
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
of the

107
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
Lamanites; he having

108
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
received a

109
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
wound has fallen

110
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
among their

111
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
dead, and they

112
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
have left him;

113
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
and behold, we

114
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
have brought

115
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
him before you;

116
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
and now let us slay him.

117
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
14 But Limhi

118
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
said unto

119
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
them: Ye shall

120
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
not slay him,

121
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
but bring him

122
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
hither that

123
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
I may see

124
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
him. And they

125
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
brought him.

126
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
And Limhi said

127
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
unto him:

128
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
What cause have

129
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
ye to come up

130
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
to war

131
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
against my people?

132
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
Behold, my

133
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
people have

134
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
not broken the

135
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
oath that I

136
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
made unto you;

137
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
therefore,

138
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
why should ye

139
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
break the

140
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
oath which ye made unto my people?

141
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
15 And now

142
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
the king

143
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
said: I have

144
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
broken the oath

145
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
because thy

146
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
people did

147
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
carry away

148
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
the daughters

149
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
of my

150
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
people;

151
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
therefore, in my

152
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
anger I did

153
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
cause my people

154
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
to come up

155
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
to war against thy people.

156
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
16 And now

157
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
Limhi had

158
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
heard

159
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
nothing

160
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
concerning this

161
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
matter;

162
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
therefore he said:

163
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
I will

164
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
search among

165
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
my people

166
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
and whosoever

167
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
has done

168
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
this thing

169
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
shall

170
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
perish. Therefore

171
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
he caused

172
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
a search to

173
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
be made among his people.

174
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
17 Now

175
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
when Gideon

176
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
had heard

177
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
these

178
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
things, he

179
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
being the

180
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
king’s

181
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
captain, he went

182
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
forth and

183
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
said unto

184
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
the king:

185
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
I pray

186
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
thee forbear,

187
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
and do

188
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
not search

189
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
this

190
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
people, and lay

191
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
not this

192
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
thing to their charge.

193
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
18 For do

194
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
ye not

195
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
remember

196
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
the

197
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
priests of thy

198
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
father,

199
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
whom this

200
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
people

201
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:35,469
sought to
