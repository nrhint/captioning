00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:02,143
The Book of MosiahChapter 1 King Benjamin

2
00:00:02,143 --> 00:00:04,286
teaches his sons the language and prophecies

3
00:00:04,286 --> 00:00:06,429
of their fathers—Their religion and

4
00:00:06,429 --> 00:00:08,572
civilization have been preserved because of the

5
00:00:08,572 --> 00:00:10,715
records kept on the various plates—Mosiah is

6
00:00:10,715 --> 00:00:12,858
chosen as king and is given custody of the

7
00:00:12,858 --> 00:00:15,015
records and other things. About 130–124 B.C. 

8
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,015
1 And now there was no more contention

9
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:17,015
in all the land of Zarahemla, among

10
00:00:17,015 --> 00:00:18,015
all the people who belonged to king

11
00:00:18,015 --> 00:00:19,015
Benjamin, so that king Benjamin had

12
00:00:19,015 --> 00:00:20,888
continual peace all the remainder of his days.

13
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:20,797
2 And it came to pass that he had

14
00:00:20,797 --> 00:00:20,706
three sons; and he called their

15
00:00:20,706 --> 00:00:20,615
names Mosiah, and Helorum, and Helaman.

16
00:00:20,615 --> 00:00:20,524
And he caused that they should be

17
00:00:20,524 --> 00:00:20,433
taught in all the language of his

18
00:00:20,433 --> 00:00:20,342
fathers, that thereby they might

19
00:00:20,342 --> 00:00:20,251
become men of understanding; and that

20
00:00:20,251 --> 00:00:20,16
they might know concerning the

21
00:00:20,16 --> 00:00:20,069
prophecies which had been spoken by the

22
00:00:20,069 --> 00:00:19,978
mouths of their fathers, which

23
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:19,953
were delivered them by the hand of the Lord.

24
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:21,453
3 And he also taught them

25
00:00:21,453 --> 00:00:22,953
concerning the records which were

26
00:00:22,953 --> 00:00:24,453
engraven on the plates of brass,

27
00:00:24,453 --> 00:00:25,953
saying: My sons, I would that ye

28
00:00:25,953 --> 00:00:27,453
should remember that were it not

29
00:00:27,453 --> 00:00:28,953
for these plates, which contain

30
00:00:28,953 --> 00:00:30,453
these records and these

31
00:00:30,453 --> 00:00:31,953
commandments, we must have suffered in

32
00:00:31,953 --> 00:00:33,453
ignorance, even at this present

33
00:00:33,453 --> 00:00:34,234
time, not knowing the mysteries of God.

34
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:34,163
4 For it were not possible

35
00:00:34,163 --> 00:00:34,092
that our father, Lehi, could have

36
00:00:34,092 --> 00:00:34,021
remembered all these things,

37
00:00:34,021 --> 00:00:33,95
to have taught them to his

38
00:00:33,95 --> 00:00:33,879
children, except it were for the

39
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:33,808
help of these plates; for he

40
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:33,737
having been taught in the

41
00:00:33,737 --> 00:00:33,666
language of the Egyptians therefore

42
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:33,595
he could read these

43
00:00:33,595 --> 00:00:33,524
engravings, and teach them to his

44
00:00:33,524 --> 00:00:33,453
children, that thereby they could

45
00:00:33,453 --> 00:00:33,382
teach them to their children,

46
00:00:33,382 --> 00:00:33,311
and so fulfilling the

47
00:00:33,311 --> 00:00:33,3
commandments of God, even down to this present time.

48
00:00:33,3 --> 00:00:34,006
5 I say unto you, my sons,

49
00:00:34,006 --> 00:00:34,712
were it not for these things,

50
00:00:34,712 --> 00:00:35,418
which have been kept and

51
00:00:35,418 --> 00:00:36,124
preserved by the hand of God, that

52
00:00:36,124 --> 00:00:36,83
we might read and understand

53
00:00:36,83 --> 00:00:37,536
of his mysteries, and have

54
00:00:37,536 --> 00:00:38,242
his commandments always before

55
00:00:38,242 --> 00:00:38,948
our eyes, that even our

56
00:00:38,948 --> 00:00:39,654
fathers would have dwindled in

57
00:00:39,654 --> 00:00:40,36
unbelief, and we should have

58
00:00:40,36 --> 00:00:41,066
been like unto our brethren,

59
00:00:41,066 --> 00:00:41,772
the Lamanites, who know nothing

60
00:00:41,772 --> 00:00:42,478
concerning these things, or

61
00:00:42,478 --> 00:00:43,184
even do not believe them when

62
00:00:43,184 --> 00:00:43,89
they are taught them,

63
00:00:43,89 --> 00:00:44,596
because of the traditions of their

64
00:00:44,596 --> 00:00:45,212
fathers, which are not correct.

65
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:46,129
6 O my sons, I would that ye

66
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,046
should remember that these

67
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:47,963
sayings are true, and also

68
00:00:47,963 --> 00:00:48,88
that these records are true.

69
00:00:48,88 --> 00:00:49,797
And behold, also the plates

70
00:00:49,797 --> 00:00:50,714
of Nephi, which contain the

71
00:00:50,714 --> 00:00:51,631
records and the sayings of

72
00:00:51,631 --> 00:00:52,548
our fathers from the time

73
00:00:52,548 --> 00:00:53,465
they left Jerusalem until now,

74
00:00:53,465 --> 00:00:54,382
and they are true; and we

75
00:00:54,382 --> 00:00:55,299
can know of their surety

76
00:00:55,299 --> 00:00:56,657
because we have them before our eyes.

77
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:56,557
7 And now, my sons, I

78
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:56,457
would that ye should

79
00:00:56,457 --> 00:00:56,357
remember to search them

80
00:00:56,357 --> 00:00:56,257
diligently, that ye may profit

81
00:00:56,257 --> 00:00:56,157
thereby; and I would that

82
00:00:56,157 --> 00:00:56,057
ye should keep the

83
00:00:56,057 --> 00:00:55,957
commandments of God, that ye may

84
00:00:55,957 --> 00:00:55,857
prosper in the land

85
00:00:55,857 --> 00:00:55,757
according to the promises

86
00:00:55,757 --> 00:00:55,722
which the Lord made unto our fathers.

87
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:55,472
8 And many more things

88
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:55,222
did king Benjamin teach

89
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:54,972
his sons, which are

90
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:54,788
not written in this book.

91
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:54,871
9 And it came to pass

92
00:00:54,871 --> 00:00:54,954
that after king

93
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:55,037
Benjamin had made an end

94
00:00:55,037 --> 00:00:55,12
of teaching his sons,

95
00:00:55,12 --> 00:00:55,203
that he waxed old,

96
00:00:55,203 --> 00:00:55,286
and he saw that he

97
00:00:55,286 --> 00:00:55,369
must very soon go the

98
00:00:55,369 --> 00:00:55,452
way of all the earth;

99
00:00:55,452 --> 00:00:55,535
therefore, he thought

100
00:00:55,535 --> 00:00:55,618
it expedient that he

101
00:00:55,618 --> 00:00:55,701
should confer the

102
00:00:55,701 --> 00:00:55,789
kingdom upon one of his sons.

103
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:55,747
10 Therefore, he had

104
00:00:55,747 --> 00:00:55,705
Mosiah brought

105
00:00:55,705 --> 00:00:55,663
before him; and these

106
00:00:55,663 --> 00:00:55,621
are the words which he

107
00:00:55,621 --> 00:00:55,579
spake unto him,

108
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:55,537
saying: My son, I would

109
00:00:55,537 --> 00:00:55,495
that ye should make

110
00:00:55,495 --> 00:00:55,453
a proclamation

111
00:00:55,453 --> 00:00:55,411
throughout all this land

112
00:00:55,411 --> 00:00:55,369
among all this

113
00:00:55,369 --> 00:00:55,327
people, or the people of

114
00:00:55,327 --> 00:00:55,285
Zarahemla, and the

115
00:00:55,285 --> 00:00:55,243
people of Mosiah who

116
00:00:55,243 --> 00:00:55,201
dwell in the land,

117
00:00:55,201 --> 00:00:55,159
that thereby they

118
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:55,117
may be gathered

119
00:00:55,117 --> 00:00:55,075
together; for on the

120
00:00:55,075 --> 00:00:55,033
morrow I shall proclaim

121
00:00:55,033 --> 00:00:54,991
unto this my people

122
00:00:54,991 --> 00:00:54,949
out of mine own mouth

123
00:00:54,949 --> 00:00:54,907
that thou art a

124
00:00:54,907 --> 00:00:54,865
king and a ruler over

125
00:00:54,865 --> 00:00:54,823
this people, whom the

126
00:00:54,823 --> 00:00:54,855
Lord our God hath given us.

127
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:54,784
11 And moreover, I

128
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:54,713
shall give this

129
00:00:54,713 --> 00:00:54,642
people a name, that

130
00:00:54,642 --> 00:00:54,571
thereby they may be

131
00:00:54,571 --> 00:00:54,5
distinguished above

132
00:00:54,5 --> 00:00:54,429
all the people

133
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:54,358
which the Lord God hath

134
00:00:54,358 --> 00:00:54,287
brought out of the

135
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:54,216
land of Jerusalem;

136
00:00:54,216 --> 00:00:54,145
and this I do

137
00:00:54,145 --> 00:00:54,074
because they have been

138
00:00:54,074 --> 00:00:54,003
a diligent people

139
00:00:54,003 --> 00:00:53,932
in keeping the

140
00:00:53,932 --> 00:00:53,921
commandments of the Lord.

141
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:54,088
12 And I give

142
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:54,255
unto them a name

143
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:54,422
that never shall

144
00:00:54,422 --> 00:00:54,589
be blotted out,

145
00:00:54,589 --> 00:00:54,756
except it be

146
00:00:54,756 --> 00:00:54,922
through transgression.

147
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:54,879
13 Yea, and

148
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:54,836
moreover I say

149
00:00:54,836 --> 00:00:54,793
unto you, that if

150
00:00:54,793 --> 00:00:54,75
this highly

151
00:00:54,75 --> 00:00:54,707
favored people of

152
00:00:54,707 --> 00:00:54,664
the Lord should

153
00:00:54,664 --> 00:00:54,621
fall into

154
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:54,578
transgression, and

155
00:00:54,578 --> 00:00:54,535
become a wicked

156
00:00:54,535 --> 00:00:54,492
and an

157
00:00:54,492 --> 00:00:54,449
adulterous people,

158
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:54,406
that the Lord will

159
00:00:54,406 --> 00:00:54,363
deliver them

160
00:00:54,363 --> 00:00:54,32
up, that thereby

161
00:00:54,32 --> 00:00:54,277
they become

162
00:00:54,277 --> 00:00:54,234
weak like unto

163
00:00:54,234 --> 00:00:54,191
their brethren;

164
00:00:54,191 --> 00:00:54,148
and he will no

165
00:00:54,148 --> 00:00:54,105
more preserve

166
00:00:54,105 --> 00:00:54,062
them by his

167
00:00:54,062 --> 00:00:54,019
matchless and

168
00:00:54,019 --> 00:00:53,976
marvelous power, as

169
00:00:53,976 --> 00:00:53,987
he has hitherto preserved our fathers.

170
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:54,141
14 For I say

171
00:00:54,141 --> 00:00:54,295
unto you, that

172
00:00:54,295 --> 00:00:54,449
if he had not

173
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:54,603
extended his

174
00:00:54,603 --> 00:00:54,757
arm in the

175
00:00:54,757 --> 00:00:54,911
preservation of

176
00:00:54,911 --> 00:00:55,065
our fathers they

177
00:00:55,065 --> 00:00:55,219
must have

178
00:00:55,219 --> 00:00:55,373
fallen into the

179
00:00:55,373 --> 00:00:55,527
hands of the

180
00:00:55,527 --> 00:00:55,681
Lamanites, and

181
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:55,835
become victims

182
00:00:55,835 --> 00:00:55,455
to their hatred.

183
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:55,622
15 And it

184
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:55,789
came to pass

185
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:55,956
that after king

186
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:56,123
Benjamin had

187
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:56,29
made an end

188
00:00:56,29 --> 00:00:56,457
of these

189
00:00:56,457 --> 00:00:56,624
sayings to his

190
00:00:56,624 --> 00:00:56,791
son, that he

191
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:56,958
gave him charge

192
00:00:56,958 --> 00:00:57,125
concerning

193
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:57,292
all the affairs

194
00:00:57,292 --> 00:00:57,391
of the kingdom.

195
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:57,358
16 And

196
00:00:57,358 --> 00:00:57,325
moreover, he also

197
00:00:57,325 --> 00:00:57,292
gave him

198
00:00:57,292 --> 00:00:57,259
charge

199
00:00:57,259 --> 00:00:57,226
concerning the

200
00:00:57,226 --> 00:00:57,193
records which

201
00:00:57,193 --> 00:00:57,16
were engraven

202
00:00:57,16 --> 00:00:57,127
on the

203
00:00:57,127 --> 00:00:57,094
plates of brass;

204
00:00:57,094 --> 00:00:57,061
and also the

205
00:00:57,061 --> 00:00:57,028
plates of

206
00:00:57,028 --> 00:00:56,995
Nephi; and

207
00:00:56,995 --> 00:00:56,962
also, the

208
00:00:56,962 --> 00:00:56,929
sword of Laban,

209
00:00:56,929 --> 00:00:56,896
and the ball

210
00:00:56,896 --> 00:00:56,863
or

211
00:00:56,863 --> 00:00:56,83
director, which led

212
00:00:56,83 --> 00:00:56,797
our fathers

213
00:00:56,797 --> 00:00:56,764
through the

214
00:00:56,764 --> 00:00:56,731
wilderness,

215
00:00:56,731 --> 00:00:56,698
which was

216
00:00:56,698 --> 00:00:56,665
prepared by

217
00:00:56,665 --> 00:00:56,632
the hand of

218
00:00:56,632 --> 00:00:56,599
the Lord that

219
00:00:56,599 --> 00:00:56,566
thereby they

220
00:00:56,566 --> 00:00:56,533
might be

221
00:00:56,533 --> 00:00:56,5
led, every one

222
00:00:56,5 --> 00:00:56,467
according

223
00:00:56,467 --> 00:00:56,434
to the heed

224
00:00:56,434 --> 00:00:56,456
and diligence which they gave unto him.

225
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:56,413
17

226
00:00:56,413 --> 00:00:56,37
Therefore, as they

227
00:00:56,37 --> 00:00:56,327
were

228
00:00:56,327 --> 00:00:56,284
unfaithful they

229
00:00:56,284 --> 00:00:56,241
did not

230
00:00:56,241 --> 00:00:56,198
prosper nor

231
00:00:56,198 --> 00:00:56,155
progress in

232
00:00:56,155 --> 00:00:56,112
their

233
00:00:56,112 --> 00:00:56,069
journey, but were

234
00:00:56,069 --> 00:00:56,026
driven

235
00:00:56,026 --> 00:00:55,983
back, and

236
00:00:55,983 --> 00:00:55,94
incurred the

237
00:00:55,94 --> 00:00:55,897
displeasure of

238
00:00:55,897 --> 00:00:55,854
God upon

239
00:00:55,854 --> 00:00:55,811
them; and

240
00:00:55,811 --> 00:00:55,768
therefore

241
00:00:55,768 --> 00:00:55,725
they were

242
00:00:55,725 --> 00:00:55,682
smitten with

243
00:00:55,682 --> 00:00:55,639
famine and

244
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:55,596
sore

245
00:00:55,596 --> 00:00:55,553
afflictions, to

246
00:00:55,553 --> 00:00:55,51
stir them up

247
00:00:55,51 --> 00:00:55,522
in remembrance of their duty.

248
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:55,485
18 And

249
00:00:55,485 --> 00:00:55,448
now, it came

250
00:00:55,448 --> 00:00:55,411
to pass

251
00:00:55,411 --> 00:00:55,374
that Mosiah

252
00:00:55,374 --> 00:00:55,337
went and

253
00:00:55,337 --> 00:00:55,3
did as his

254
00:00:55,3 --> 00:00:55,263
father had

255
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:55,226
commanded

256
00:00:55,226 --> 00:00:55,189
him, and

257
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:55,152
proclaimed

258
00:00:55,152 --> 00:00:55,115
unto all

259
00:00:55,115 --> 00:00:55,078
the people

260
00:00:55,078 --> 00:00:55,041
who were

261
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:55,004
in the

262
00:00:55,004 --> 00:00:54,967
land of

263
00:00:54,967 --> 00:00:54,93
Zarahemla that

264
00:00:54,93 --> 00:00:54,893
thereby

265
00:00:54,893 --> 00:00:54,856
they might

266
00:00:54,856 --> 00:00:54,819
gather

267
00:00:54,819 --> 00:00:54,782
themselves

268
00:00:54,782 --> 00:00:54,745
together, to

269
00:00:54,745 --> 00:00:54,708
go up to

270
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:54,671
the temple

271
00:00:54,671 --> 00:00:54,634
to hear

272
00:00:54,634 --> 00:00:54,597
the words

273
00:00:54,597 --> 00:00:54,56
which his

274
00:00:54,56 --> 00:00:54,588
father should speak unto them.
