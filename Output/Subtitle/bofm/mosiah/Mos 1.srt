00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:08,571
The Book of MosiahChapter 1 King Benjamin teaches

2
00:00:08,571 --> 00:00:17,142
 his sons the language and prophecies of their

3
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:25,713
 fathers—Their religion and civilization have been

4
00:00:25,713 --> 00:00:34,284
 preserved because of the records kept on the various

5
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:42,855
 plates—Mosiah is chosen as king and is given

6
00:00:42,855 --> 00:00:51,426
 custody of the records and other things. About

7
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:59,997
 130–124 B.C.

8
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:08,561
1 And now there was no more contention in all the

9
00:01:08,561 --> 00:01:16,561
 land of Zarahemla, among all the people who

10
00:01:16,561 --> 00:01:24,561
 belonged to king Benjamin, so that king Benjamin had

11
00:01:24,561 --> 00:01:32,561
 continual peace all the remainder of his days

12
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:38,6
2 And it came to pass that he had three sons; and

13
00:01:38,6 --> 00:01:44,975
 he called their names Mosiah, and Helorum, and

14
00:01:44,975 --> 00:01:51,35
 Helaman. And he caused that they should be taught in

15
00:01:51,35 --> 00:01:57,725
 all the language of his fathers, that thereby they

16
00:01:57,725 --> 00:02:04,1
 might become men of understanding; and that they

17
00:02:04,1 --> 00:02:10,475
 might know concerning the prophecies which had

18
00:02:10,475 --> 00:02:16,85
 been spoken by the mouths of their fathers, which

19
00:02:16,85 --> 00:02:23,225
 were delivered them by the hand of the Lord

20
00:02:23,11 --> 00:02:29,539
3 And he also taught them concerning the records

21
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:35,968
 which were engraven on the plates of brass, saying:

22
00:02:35,968 --> 00:02:42,397
 My sons, I would that ye should remember that

23
00:02:42,397 --> 00:02:48,826
 were it not for these plates, which contain these

24
00:02:48,826 --> 00:02:55,255
 records and these commandments, we must have suffered

25
00:02:55,255 --> 00:03:01,684
 in ignorance, even at this present time, not

26
00:03:01,684 --> 00:03:08,113
 knowing the mysteries of God

27
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:14,022
4 For it were not possible that our father, Lehi,

28
00:03:14,022 --> 00:03:19,689
 could have remembered all these things, to have

29
00:03:19,689 --> 00:03:25,356
 taught them to his children, except it were for the

30
00:03:25,356 --> 00:03:31,023
 help of these plates; for he having been taught in

31
00:03:31,023 --> 00:03:36,69
 the language of the Egyptians therefore he could

32
00:03:36,69 --> 00:03:42,357
 read these engravings, and teach them to his

33
00:03:42,357 --> 00:03:48,024
 children, that thereby they could teach them to their

34
00:03:48,024 --> 00:03:53,691
 children, and so fulfilling the commandments of

35
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:59,358
 God, even down to this present time

36
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:06,373
5 I say unto you, my sons, were it not for these

37
00:04:06,373 --> 00:04:13,073
 things, which have been kept and preserved by the

38
00:04:13,073 --> 00:04:19,773
 hand of God, that we might read and understand of

39
00:04:19,773 --> 00:04:26,473
 his mysteries, and have his commandments always

40
00:04:26,473 --> 00:04:33,173
 before our eyes, that even our fathers would have

41
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:39,873
 dwindled in unbelief, and we should have been like

42
00:04:39,873 --> 00:04:46,573
 unto our brethren, the Lamanites, who know nothing

43
00:04:46,573 --> 00:04:53,273
 concerning these things, or even do not believe

44
00:04:53,273 --> 00:04:59,973
 them when they are taught them, because of the

45
00:04:59,973 --> 00:05:06,673
 traditions of their fathers, which are not correct

46
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:13,03
6 O my sons, I would that ye should remember that

47
00:05:13,03 --> 00:05:19,887
 these sayings are true, and also that these

48
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:26,744
 records are true. And behold, also the plates of Nephi,

49
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:33,601
 which contain the records and the sayings of our

50
00:05:33,601 --> 00:05:40,458
 fathers from the time they left Jerusalem until

51
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:47,315
 now, and they are true; and we can know of their

52
00:05:47,315 --> 00:05:54,172
 surety because we have them before our eyes

53
00:05:54,921 --> 00:06:01,588
7 And now, my sons, I would that ye should

54
00:06:01,588 --> 00:06:08,255
 remember to search them diligently, that ye may profit

55
00:06:08,255 --> 00:06:14,922
 thereby; and I would that ye should keep the

56
00:06:14,922 --> 00:06:21,589
 commandments of God, that ye may prosper in the land

57
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:28,256
 according to the promises which the Lord made unto our

58
00:06:28,256 --> 00:06:34,923
 fathers

59
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:41,861
8 And many more things did king Benjamin teach his

60
00:06:41,861 --> 00:06:48,861
 sons, which are not written in this book

61
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:54,842
9 And it came to pass that after king Benjamin had

62
00:06:54,842 --> 00:07:00,842
 made an end of teaching his sons, that he waxed

63
00:07:00,842 --> 00:07:06,842
 old, and he saw that he must very soon go the way

64
00:07:06,842 --> 00:07:12,842
 of all the earth; therefore, he thought it

65
00:07:12,842 --> 00:07:18,842
 expedient that he should confer the kingdom upon one of

66
00:07:18,842 --> 00:07:24,842
 his sons

67
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:27,144
10 Therefore, he had Mosiah brought before him;

68
00:07:27,144 --> 00:07:30,244
 and these are the words which he spake unto him,

69
00:07:30,244 --> 00:07:33,344
 saying: My son, I would that ye should make a

70
00:07:33,344 --> 00:07:36,444
 proclamation throughout all this land among all this

71
00:07:36,444 --> 00:07:39,544
 people, or the people of Zarahemla, and the people of

72
00:07:39,544 --> 00:07:42,644
 Mosiah who dwell in the land, that thereby they

73
00:07:42,644 --> 00:07:45,744
 may be gathered together; for on the morrow I shall

74
00:07:45,744 --> 00:07:48,844
 proclaim unto this my people out of mine own mouth

75
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:51,944
 that thou art a king and a ruler over this

76
00:07:51,944 --> 00:07:55,044
 people, whom the Lord our God hath given us

77
00:07:55,942 --> 00:08:03,942
11 And moreover, I shall give this people a name,

78
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:11,942
 that thereby they may be distinguished above all

79
00:08:11,942 --> 00:08:19,942
 the people which the Lord God hath brought out of

80
00:08:19,942 --> 00:08:27,942
 the land of Jerusalem; and this I do because they

81
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:35,942
 have been a diligent people in keeping the

82
00:08:35,942 --> 00:08:43,942
 commandments of the Lord

83
00:08:43,79 --> 00:09:01,29
12 And I give unto them a name that never shall be

84
00:09:01,29 --> 00:09:18,79
 blotted out, except it be through transgression

85
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:24,933
13 Yea, and moreover I say unto you, that if this

86
00:09:24,933 --> 00:09:31,308
 highly favored people of the Lord should fall into

87
00:09:31,308 --> 00:09:37,683
 transgression, and become a wicked and an

88
00:09:37,683 --> 00:09:44,058
 adulterous people, that the Lord will deliver them up,

89
00:09:44,058 --> 00:09:50,433
 that thereby they become weak like unto their

90
00:09:50,433 --> 00:09:56,808
 brethren; and he will no more preserve them by his

91
00:09:56,808 --> 00:10:03,183
 matchless and marvelous power, as he has hitherto

92
00:10:03,183 --> 00:10:09,558
 preserved our fathers

93
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:14,726
14 For I say unto you, that if he had not extended

94
00:10:14,726 --> 00:10:19,976
 his arm in the preservation of our fathers they

95
00:10:19,976 --> 00:10:25,226
 must have fallen into the hands of the Lamanites,

96
00:10:25,226 --> 00:10:30,476
 and become victims to their hatred

97
00:10:30,73 --> 00:10:36,23
15 And it came to pass that after king Benjamin

98
00:10:36,23 --> 00:10:41,73
 had made an end of these sayings to his son, that he

99
00:10:41,73 --> 00:10:47,23
 gave him charge concerning all the affairs of the

100
00:10:47,23 --> 00:10:52,73
 kingdom

101
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:58,935
16 And moreover, he also gave him charge

102
00:10:58,935 --> 00:11:05,185
 concerning the records which were engraven on the plates of

103
00:11:05,185 --> 00:11:11,435
 brass; and also the plates of Nephi; and also,

104
00:11:11,435 --> 00:11:17,685
 the sword of Laban, and the ball or director, which

105
00:11:17,685 --> 00:11:23,935
 led our fathers through the wilderness, which was

106
00:11:23,935 --> 00:11:30,185
 prepared by the hand of the Lord that thereby they

107
00:11:30,185 --> 00:11:36,435
 might be led, every one according to the heed and

108
00:11:36,435 --> 00:11:42,685
 diligence which they gave unto him

109
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:49,069
17 Therefore, as they were unfaithful they did not

110
00:11:49,069 --> 00:11:55,236
 prosper nor progress in their journey, but were

111
00:11:55,236 --> 00:12:01,403
 driven back, and incurred the displeasure of God

112
00:12:01,403 --> 00:12:07,57
 upon them; and therefore they were smitten with

113
00:12:07,57 --> 00:12:13,737
 famine and sore afflictions, to stir them up in

114
00:12:13,737 --> 00:12:19,904
 remembrance of their duty

115
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:21,306
18 And now, it came to pass that Mosiah went and

116
00:12:21,306 --> 00:12:22,639
 did as his father had commanded him, and proclaimed

117
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:23,972
 unto all the people who were in the land of

118
00:12:23,972 --> 00:12:25,305
 Zarahemla that thereby they might gather themselves

119
00:12:25,305 --> 00:12:26,638
 together, to go up to the temple to hear the words

120
00:12:26,638 --> 00:12:27,971
 which his father should speak unto them.
