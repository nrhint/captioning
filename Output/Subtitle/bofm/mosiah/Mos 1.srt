00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
The Book of MosiahChapter 1 King Benjamin

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
teaches his sons the language and prophecies

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of their fathers—Their religion and

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
civilization have been preserved because of the

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
records kept on the various plates—Mosiah is

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
chosen as king and is given custody of the

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:04:29,
records and other things. About 130–124 B.C. 

8
00:04:29,0 --> 00:04:29,0
1 And now there was no more contention

9
00:04:29,0 --> 00:04:29,0
in all the land of Zarahemla, among

10
00:04:29,0 --> 00:04:29,0
all the people who belonged to king

11
00:04:29,0 --> 00:04:29,0
Benjamin, so that king Benjamin had

12
00:04:29,0 --> 00:18:54,
continual peace all the remainder of his days.

13
00:18:54,0 --> 00:18:54,0
2 And it came to pass that he had

14
00:18:54,0 --> 00:18:54,0
three sons; and he called their

15
00:18:54,0 --> 00:18:54,0
names Mosiah, and Helorum, and Helaman.

16
00:18:54,0 --> 00:18:54,0
And he caused that they should be

17
00:18:54,0 --> 00:18:54,0
taught in all the language of his

18
00:18:54,0 --> 00:18:54,0
fathers, that thereby they might

19
00:18:54,0 --> 00:18:54,0
become men of understanding; and that

20
00:18:54,0 --> 00:18:54,0
they might know concerning the

21
00:18:54,0 --> 00:18:54,0
prophecies which had been spoken by the

22
00:18:54,0 --> 00:18:54,0
mouths of their fathers, which

23
00:18:54,0 --> 00:29:04,
were delivered them by the hand of the Lord.

24
00:29:04,0 --> 00:29:04,0
3 And he also taught them

25
00:29:04,0 --> 00:29:04,0
concerning the records which were

26
00:29:04,0 --> 00:29:04,0
engraven on the plates of brass,

27
00:29:04,0 --> 00:29:04,0
saying: My sons, I would that ye

28
00:29:04,0 --> 00:29:04,0
should remember that were it not

29
00:29:04,0 --> 00:29:04,0
for these plates, which contain

30
00:29:04,0 --> 00:29:04,0
these records and these

31
00:29:04,0 --> 00:29:04,0
commandments, we must have suffered in

32
00:29:04,0 --> 00:29:04,0
ignorance, even at this present

33
00:29:04,0 --> 00:32:00,
time, not knowing the mysteries of God.

34
00:32:00,0 --> 00:32:00,0
4 For it were not possible

35
00:32:00,0 --> 00:32:00,0
that our father, Lehi, could have

36
00:32:00,0 --> 00:32:00,0
remembered all these things,

37
00:32:00,0 --> 00:32:00,0
to have taught them to his

38
00:32:00,0 --> 00:32:00,0
children, except it were for the

39
00:32:00,0 --> 00:32:00,0
help of these plates; for he

40
00:32:00,0 --> 00:32:00,0
having been taught in the

41
00:32:00,0 --> 00:32:00,0
language of the Egyptians therefore

42
00:32:00,0 --> 00:32:00,0
he could read these

43
00:32:00,0 --> 00:32:00,0
engravings, and teach them to his

44
00:32:00,0 --> 00:32:00,0
children, that thereby they could

45
00:32:00,0 --> 00:32:00,0
teach them to their children,

46
00:32:00,0 --> 00:32:00,0
and so fulfilling the

47
00:32:00,0 --> 00:40:55,
commandments of God, even down to this present time.

48
00:40:55,0 --> 00:40:55,0
5 I say unto you, my sons,

49
00:40:55,0 --> 00:40:55,0
were it not for these things,

50
00:40:55,0 --> 00:40:55,0
which have been kept and

51
00:40:55,0 --> 00:40:55,0
preserved by the hand of God, that

52
00:40:55,0 --> 00:40:55,0
we might read and understand

53
00:40:55,0 --> 00:40:55,0
of his mysteries, and have

54
00:40:55,0 --> 00:40:55,0
his commandments always before

55
00:40:55,0 --> 00:40:55,0
our eyes, that even our

56
00:40:55,0 --> 00:40:55,0
fathers would have dwindled in

57
00:40:55,0 --> 00:40:55,0
unbelief, and we should have

58
00:40:55,0 --> 00:40:55,0
been like unto our brethren,

59
00:40:55,0 --> 00:40:55,0
the Lamanites, who know nothing

60
00:40:55,0 --> 00:40:55,0
concerning these things, or

61
00:40:55,0 --> 00:40:55,0
even do not believe them when

62
00:40:55,0 --> 00:40:55,0
they are taught them,

63
00:40:55,0 --> 00:40:55,0
because of the traditions of their

64
00:40:55,0 --> 00:40:41,
fathers, which are not correct.

65
00:40:41,0 --> 00:40:41,0
6 O my sons, I would that ye

66
00:40:41,0 --> 00:40:41,0
should remember that these

67
00:40:41,0 --> 00:40:41,0
sayings are true, and also

68
00:40:41,0 --> 00:40:41,0
that these records are true.

69
00:40:41,0 --> 00:40:41,0
And behold, also the plates

70
00:40:41,0 --> 00:40:41,0
of Nephi, which contain the

71
00:40:41,0 --> 00:40:41,0
records and the sayings of

72
00:40:41,0 --> 00:40:41,0
our fathers from the time

73
00:40:41,0 --> 00:40:41,0
they left Jerusalem until now,

74
00:40:41,0 --> 00:40:41,0
and they are true; and we

75
00:40:41,0 --> 00:40:41,0
can know of their surety

76
00:40:41,0 --> 00:44:40,
because we have them before our eyes.

77
00:44:40,0 --> 00:44:40,0
7 And now, my sons, I

78
00:44:40,0 --> 00:44:40,0
would that ye should

79
00:44:40,0 --> 00:44:40,0
remember to search them

80
00:44:40,0 --> 00:44:40,0
diligently, that ye may profit

81
00:44:40,0 --> 00:44:40,0
thereby; and I would that

82
00:44:40,0 --> 00:44:40,0
ye should keep the

83
00:44:40,0 --> 00:44:40,0
commandments of God, that ye may

84
00:44:40,0 --> 00:44:40,0
prosper in the land

85
00:44:40,0 --> 00:44:40,0
according to the promises

86
00:44:40,0 --> 00:52:37,
which the Lord made unto our fathers.

87
00:52:37,0 --> 00:52:37,0
8 And many more things

88
00:52:37,0 --> 00:52:37,0
did king Benjamin teach

89
00:52:37,0 --> 00:52:37,0
his sons, which are

90
00:52:37,0 --> 01:00:06,
not written in this book.

91
01:00:06,0 --> 01:00:06,0
9 And it came to pass

92
01:00:06,0 --> 01:00:06,0
that after king

93
01:00:06,0 --> 01:00:06,0
Benjamin had made an end

94
01:00:06,0 --> 01:00:06,0
of teaching his sons,

95
01:00:06,0 --> 01:00:06,0
that he waxed old,

96
01:00:06,0 --> 01:00:06,0
and he saw that he

97
01:00:06,0 --> 01:00:06,0
must very soon go the

98
01:00:06,0 --> 01:00:06,0
way of all the earth;

99
01:00:06,0 --> 01:00:06,0
therefore, he thought

100
01:00:06,0 --> 01:00:06,0
it expedient that he

101
01:00:06,0 --> 01:00:06,0
should confer the

102
01:00:06,0 --> 01:05:35,
kingdom upon one of his sons.

103
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
10 Therefore, he had

104
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
Mosiah brought

105
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
before him; and these

106
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
are the words which he

107
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
spake unto him,

108
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
saying: My son, I would

109
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
that ye should make

110
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
a proclamation

111
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
throughout all this land

112
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
among all this

113
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
people, or the people of

114
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
Zarahemla, and the

115
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
people of Mosiah who

116
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
dwell in the land,

117
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
that thereby they

118
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
may be gathered

119
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
together; for on the

120
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
morrow I shall proclaim

121
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
unto this my people

122
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
out of mine own mouth

123
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
that thou art a

124
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
king and a ruler over

125
01:05:35,0 --> 01:05:35,0
this people, whom the

126
01:05:35,0 --> 01:13:33,
Lord our God hath given us.

127
01:13:33,0 --> 01:13:33,0
11 And moreover, I

128
01:13:33,0 --> 01:13:33,0
shall give this

129
01:13:33,0 --> 01:13:33,0
people a name, that

130
01:13:33,0 --> 01:13:33,0
thereby they may be

131
01:13:33,0 --> 01:13:33,0
distinguished above

132
01:13:33,0 --> 01:13:33,0
all the people

133
01:13:33,0 --> 01:13:33,0
which the Lord God hath

134
01:13:33,0 --> 01:13:33,0
brought out of the

135
01:13:33,0 --> 01:13:33,0
land of Jerusalem;

136
01:13:33,0 --> 01:13:33,0
and this I do

137
01:13:33,0 --> 01:13:33,0
because they have been

138
01:13:33,0 --> 01:13:33,0
a diligent people

139
01:13:33,0 --> 01:13:33,0
in keeping the

140
01:13:33,0 --> 01:18:30,
commandments of the Lord.

141
01:18:30,0 --> 01:18:30,0
12 And I give

142
01:18:30,0 --> 01:18:30,0
unto them a name

143
01:18:30,0 --> 01:18:30,0
that never shall

144
01:18:30,0 --> 01:18:30,0
be blotted out,

145
01:18:30,0 --> 01:18:30,0
except it be

146
01:18:30,0 --> 01:18:16,
through transgression.

147
01:18:16,0 --> 01:18:16,0
13 Yea, and

148
01:18:16,0 --> 01:18:16,0
moreover I say

149
01:18:16,0 --> 01:18:16,0
unto you, that if

150
01:18:16,0 --> 01:18:16,0
this highly

151
01:18:16,0 --> 01:18:16,0
favored people of

152
01:18:16,0 --> 01:18:16,0
the Lord should

153
01:18:16,0 --> 01:18:16,0
fall into

154
01:18:16,0 --> 01:18:16,0
transgression, and

155
01:18:16,0 --> 01:18:16,0
become a wicked

156
01:18:16,0 --> 01:18:16,0
and an

157
01:18:16,0 --> 01:18:16,0
adulterous people,

158
01:18:16,0 --> 01:18:16,0
that the Lord will

159
01:18:16,0 --> 01:18:16,0
deliver them

160
01:18:16,0 --> 01:18:16,0
up, that thereby

161
01:18:16,0 --> 01:18:16,0
they become

162
01:18:16,0 --> 01:18:16,0
weak like unto

163
01:18:16,0 --> 01:18:16,0
their brethren;

164
01:18:16,0 --> 01:18:16,0
and he will no

165
01:18:16,0 --> 01:18:16,0
more preserve

166
01:18:16,0 --> 01:18:16,0
them by his

167
01:18:16,0 --> 01:18:16,0
matchless and

168
01:18:16,0 --> 01:18:16,0
marvelous power, as

169
01:18:16,0 --> 01:23:13,
he has hitherto preserved our fathers.

170
01:23:13,0 --> 01:23:13,0
14 For I say

171
01:23:13,0 --> 01:23:13,0
unto you, that

172
01:23:13,0 --> 01:23:13,0
if he had not

173
01:23:13,0 --> 01:23:13,0
extended his

174
01:23:13,0 --> 01:23:13,0
arm in the

175
01:23:13,0 --> 01:23:13,0
preservation of

176
01:23:13,0 --> 01:23:13,0
our fathers they

177
01:23:13,0 --> 01:23:13,0
must have

178
01:23:13,0 --> 01:23:13,0
fallen into the

179
01:23:13,0 --> 01:23:13,0
hands of the

180
01:23:13,0 --> 01:23:13,0
Lamanites, and

181
01:23:13,0 --> 01:23:13,0
become victims

182
01:23:13,0 --> 01:24:43,
to their hatred.

183
01:24:43,0 --> 01:24:43,0
15 And it

184
01:24:43,0 --> 01:24:43,0
came to pass

185
01:24:43,0 --> 01:24:43,0
that after king

186
01:24:43,0 --> 01:24:43,0
Benjamin had

187
01:24:43,0 --> 01:24:43,0
made an end

188
01:24:43,0 --> 01:24:43,0
of these

189
01:24:43,0 --> 01:24:43,0
sayings to his

190
01:24:43,0 --> 01:24:43,0
son, that he

191
01:24:43,0 --> 01:24:43,0
gave him charge

192
01:24:43,0 --> 01:24:43,0
concerning

193
01:24:43,0 --> 01:24:43,0
all the affairs

194
01:24:43,0 --> 01:26:27,
of the kingdom.

195
01:26:27,0 --> 01:26:27,0
16 And

196
01:26:27,0 --> 01:26:27,0
moreover, he also

197
01:26:27,0 --> 01:26:27,0
gave him

198
01:26:27,0 --> 01:26:27,0
charge

199
01:26:27,0 --> 01:26:27,0
concerning the

200
01:26:27,0 --> 01:26:27,0
records which

201
01:26:27,0 --> 01:26:27,0
were engraven

202
01:26:27,0 --> 01:26:27,0
on the

203
01:26:27,0 --> 01:26:27,0
plates of brass;

204
01:26:27,0 --> 01:26:27,0
and also the

205
01:26:27,0 --> 01:26:27,0
plates of

206
01:26:27,0 --> 01:26:27,0
Nephi; and

207
01:26:27,0 --> 01:26:27,0
also, the

208
01:26:27,0 --> 01:26:27,0
sword of Laban,

209
01:26:27,0 --> 01:26:27,0
and the ball

210
01:26:27,0 --> 01:26:27,0
or

211
01:26:27,0 --> 01:26:27,0
director, which led

212
01:26:27,0 --> 01:26:27,0
our fathers

213
01:26:27,0 --> 01:26:27,0
through the

214
01:26:27,0 --> 01:26:27,0
wilderness,

215
01:26:27,0 --> 01:26:27,0
which was

216
01:26:27,0 --> 01:26:27,0
prepared by

217
01:26:27,0 --> 01:26:27,0
the hand of

218
01:26:27,0 --> 01:26:27,0
the Lord that

219
01:26:27,0 --> 01:26:27,0
thereby they

220
01:26:27,0 --> 01:26:27,0
might be

221
01:26:27,0 --> 01:26:27,0
led, every one

222
01:26:27,0 --> 01:26:27,0
according

223
01:26:27,0 --> 01:26:27,0
to the heed

224
01:26:27,0 --> 01:25:59,
and diligence which they gave unto him.

225
01:25:59,0 --> 01:25:59,0
17

226
01:25:59,0 --> 01:25:59,0
Therefore, as they

227
01:25:59,0 --> 01:25:59,0
were

228
01:25:59,0 --> 01:25:59,0
unfaithful they

229
01:25:59,0 --> 01:25:59,0
did not

230
01:25:59,0 --> 01:25:59,0
prosper nor

231
01:25:59,0 --> 01:25:59,0
progress in

232
01:25:59,0 --> 01:25:59,0
their

233
01:25:59,0 --> 01:25:59,0
journey, but were

234
01:25:59,0 --> 01:25:59,0
driven

235
01:25:59,0 --> 01:25:59,0
back, and

236
01:25:59,0 --> 01:25:59,0
incurred the

237
01:25:59,0 --> 01:25:59,0
displeasure of

238
01:25:59,0 --> 01:25:59,0
God upon

239
01:25:59,0 --> 01:25:59,0
them; and

240
01:25:59,0 --> 01:25:59,0
therefore

241
01:25:59,0 --> 01:25:59,0
they were

242
01:25:59,0 --> 01:25:59,0
smitten with

243
01:25:59,0 --> 01:25:59,0
famine and

244
01:25:59,0 --> 01:25:59,0
sore

245
01:25:59,0 --> 01:25:59,0
afflictions, to

246
01:25:59,0 --> 01:25:59,0
stir them up

247
01:25:59,0 --> 01:29:30,
in remembrance of their duty.

248
01:29:30,0 --> 01:29:30,0
18 And

249
01:29:30,0 --> 01:29:30,0
now, it came

250
01:29:30,0 --> 01:29:30,0
to pass

251
01:29:30,0 --> 01:29:30,0
that Mosiah

252
01:29:30,0 --> 01:29:30,0
went and

253
01:29:30,0 --> 01:29:30,0
did as his

254
01:29:30,0 --> 01:29:30,0
father had

255
01:29:30,0 --> 01:29:30,0
commanded

256
01:29:30,0 --> 01:29:30,0
him, and

257
01:29:30,0 --> 01:29:30,0
proclaimed

258
01:29:30,0 --> 01:29:30,0
unto all

259
01:29:30,0 --> 01:29:30,0
the people

260
01:29:30,0 --> 01:29:30,0
who were

261
01:29:30,0 --> 01:29:30,0
in the

262
01:29:30,0 --> 01:29:30,0
land of

263
01:29:30,0 --> 01:29:30,0
Zarahemla that

264
01:29:30,0 --> 01:29:30,0
thereby

265
01:29:30,0 --> 01:29:30,0
they might

266
01:29:30,0 --> 01:29:30,0
gather

267
01:29:30,0 --> 01:29:30,0
themselves

268
01:29:30,0 --> 01:29:30,0
together, to

269
01:29:30,0 --> 01:29:30,0
go up to

270
01:29:30,0 --> 01:29:30,0
the temple

271
01:29:30,0 --> 01:29:30,0
to hear

272
01:29:30,0 --> 01:29:30,0
the words

273
01:29:30,0 --> 01:29:30,0
which his

274
01:29:30,0 --> 01:29:16,
father should speak unto them.
