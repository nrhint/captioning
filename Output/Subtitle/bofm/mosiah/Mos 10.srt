00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,75
Chapter 10 King Laman dies—His people are wild and

2
00:00:01,75 --> 00:00:03,5
 ferocious and believe in false traditions—Zeniff

3
00:00:03,5 --> 00:00:05,25
 and his people prevail against them. About

4
00:00:05,25 --> 00:00:07,0
 187–160 B.C.

5
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,118
1 And it came to pass that we again began to

6
00:00:09,118 --> 00:00:10,261
 establish the kingdom and we again began to possess the

7
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:11,404
 land in peace. And I caused that there should be

8
00:00:11,404 --> 00:00:12,547
 weapons of war made of every kind, that thereby I

9
00:00:12,547 --> 00:00:13,69
 might have weapons for my people against the time

10
00:00:13,69 --> 00:00:14,833
 the Lamanites should come up again to war against

11
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:15,976
 my people

12
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:19,149
2 And I set guards round about the land, that the

13
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:22,349
 Lamanites might not come upon us again unawares

14
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:25,549
 and destroy us; and thus I did guard my people and

15
00:00:25,549 --> 00:00:28,749
 my flocks, and keep them from falling into the

16
00:00:28,749 --> 00:00:31,949
 hands of our enemies

17
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:34,566
3 And it came to pass that we did inherit the land

18
00:00:34,566 --> 00:00:37,233
 of our fathers for many years, yea, for the space

19
00:00:37,233 --> 00:00:39,9
 of twenty and two years

20
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:45,206
4 And I did cause that the men should till the

21
00:00:45,206 --> 00:00:50,539
 ground, and raise all manner of grain and all manner

22
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:55,872
 of fruit of every kind

23
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:59,822
5 And I did cause that the women should spin, and

24
00:00:59,822 --> 00:01:03,822
 toil, and work, and work all manner of fine linen,

25
00:01:03,822 --> 00:01:07,822
 yea, and cloth of every kind, that we might

26
00:01:07,822 --> 00:01:11,822
 clothe our nakedness; and thus we did prosper in the

27
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:15,822
 land—thus we did have continual peace in the land

28
00:01:15,822 --> 00:01:19,822
 for the space of twenty and two years

29
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,946
6 And it came to pass that king Laman died, and

30
00:01:22,946 --> 00:01:26,146
 his son began to reign in his stead. And he began to

31
00:01:26,146 --> 00:01:29,346
 stir his people up in rebellion against my

32
00:01:29,346 --> 00:01:32,546
 people; therefore they began to prepare for war, and to

33
00:01:32,546 --> 00:01:35,746
 come up to battle against my people

34
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,696
7 But I had sent my spies out round about the land

35
00:01:37,696 --> 00:01:39,696
 of Shemlon, that I might discover their

36
00:01:39,696 --> 00:01:41,696
 preparations, that I might guard against them, that they

37
00:01:41,696 --> 00:01:43,696
 might not come upon my people and destroy them

38
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:45,956
8 And it came to pass that they came up upon the

39
00:01:45,956 --> 00:01:48,242
 north of the land of Shilom, with their numerous

40
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:50,528
 hosts, men armed with bows, and with arrows, and

41
00:01:50,528 --> 00:01:52,814
 with swords, and with cimeters, and with stones, and

42
00:01:52,814 --> 00:01:55,1
 with slings; and they had their heads shaved that

43
00:01:55,1 --> 00:01:57,386
 they were naked; and they were girded with a

44
00:01:57,386 --> 00:01:59,672
 leathern girdle about their loins

45
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:00,62
9 And it came to pass that I caused that the women

46
00:02:00,62 --> 00:02:01,62
 and children of my people should be hid in the

47
00:02:01,62 --> 00:02:02,62
 wilderness; and I also caused that all my old men

48
00:02:02,62 --> 00:02:03,62
 that could bear arms, and also all my young men that

49
00:02:03,62 --> 00:02:04,62
 were able to bear arms, should gather themselves

50
00:02:04,62 --> 00:02:05,62
 together to go to battle against the Lamanites;

51
00:02:05,62 --> 00:02:06,62
 and I did place them in their ranks, every man

52
00:02:06,62 --> 00:02:07,62
 according to his age

53
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:10,794
10 And it came to pass that we did go up to battle

54
00:02:10,794 --> 00:02:13,994
 against the Lamanites; and I, even I, in my old

55
00:02:13,994 --> 00:02:17,194
 age, did go up to battle against the Lamanites. And

56
00:02:17,194 --> 00:02:20,394
 it came to pass that we did go up in the strength

57
00:02:20,394 --> 00:02:23,594
 of the Lord to battle

58
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,543
11 Now, the Lamanites knew nothing concerning the

59
00:02:25,543 --> 00:02:27,543
 Lord, nor the strength of the Lord, therefore they

60
00:02:27,543 --> 00:02:29,543
 depended upon their own strength. Yet they were a

61
00:02:29,543 --> 00:02:31,543
 strong people, as to the strength of men

62
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:32,661
12 They were a wild, and ferocious, and a

63
00:02:32,661 --> 00:02:33,804
 blood-thirsty people, believing in the tradition of their

64
00:02:33,804 --> 00:02:34,947
 fathers, which is this—Believing that they were

65
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:36,09
 driven out of the land of Jerusalem because of the

66
00:02:36,09 --> 00:02:37,233
 iniquities of their fathers, and that they were

67
00:02:37,233 --> 00:02:38,376
 wronged in the wilderness by their brethren, and they

68
00:02:38,376 --> 00:02:39,519
 were also wronged while crossing the sea

69
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,779
13 And again, that they were wronged while in the

70
00:02:41,779 --> 00:02:44,065
 land of their first inheritance, after they had

71
00:02:44,065 --> 00:02:46,351
 crossed the sea, and all this because that Nephi was

72
00:02:46,351 --> 00:02:48,637
 more faithful in keeping the commandments of the

73
00:02:48,637 --> 00:02:50,923
 Lord—therefore he was favored of the Lord, for the

74
00:02:50,923 --> 00:02:53,209
 Lord heard his prayers and answered them, and he

75
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:55,495
 took the lead of their journey in the wilderness

76
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:59,442
14 And his brethren were wroth with him because

77
00:02:59,442 --> 00:03:03,442
 they understood not the dealings of the Lord; they

78
00:03:03,442 --> 00:03:07,442
 were also wroth with him upon the waters because

79
00:03:07,442 --> 00:03:11,442
 they hardened their hearts against the Lord

80
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:15,391
15 And again, they were wroth with him when they

81
00:03:15,391 --> 00:03:19,391
 had arrived in the promised land, because they said

82
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:23,391
 that he had taken the ruling of the people out of

83
00:03:23,391 --> 00:03:27,391
 their hands; and they sought to kill him

84
00:03:27,34 --> 00:03:35,34
16 And again, they were wroth with him because he

85
00:03:35,34 --> 00:03:43,34
 departed into the wilderness as the Lord had

86
00:03:43,34 --> 00:03:51,34
 commanded him, and took the records which were engraven

87
00:03:51,34 --> 00:03:59,34
 on the plates of brass, for they said that he

88
00:03:59,34 --> 00:04:07,34
 robbed them

89
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:08,547
17 And thus they have taught their children that

90
00:04:08,547 --> 00:04:09,88
 they should hate them, and that they should murder

91
00:04:09,88 --> 00:04:11,213
 them, and that they should rob and plunder them,

92
00:04:11,213 --> 00:04:12,546
 and do all they could to destroy them; therefore

93
00:04:12,546 --> 00:04:13,879
 they have an eternal hatred towards the children of

94
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,212
 Nephi

95
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,855
18 For this very cause has king Laman, by his

96
00:04:17,855 --> 00:04:20,522
 cunning, and lying craftiness, and his fair promises,

97
00:04:20,522 --> 00:04:23,189
 deceived me, that I have brought this my people up

98
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:25,856
 into this land, that they may destroy them; yea,

99
00:04:25,856 --> 00:04:28,523
 and we have suffered these many years in the land

100
00:04:28,523 --> 00:04:31,19


101
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:32,738
19 And now I, Zeniff, after having told all these

102
00:04:32,738 --> 00:04:34,338
 things unto my people concerning the Lamanites, I

103
00:04:34,338 --> 00:04:35,938
 did stimulate them to go to battle with their

104
00:04:35,938 --> 00:04:37,538
 might, putting their trust in the Lord; therefore, we

105
00:04:37,538 --> 00:04:39,138
 did contend with them, face to face

106
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,112
20 And it came to pass that we did drive them

107
00:04:41,112 --> 00:04:43,112
 again out of our land; and we slew them with a great

108
00:04:43,112 --> 00:04:45,112
 slaughter, even so many that we did not number

109
00:04:45,112 --> 00:04:47,112
 them

110
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,754
21 And it came to pass that we returned again to

111
00:04:49,754 --> 00:04:52,421
 our own land, and my people again began to tend

112
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:55,088
 their flocks, and to till their ground

113
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:55,394
22 And now I, being old, did confer the kingdom

114
00:04:55,394 --> 00:04:55,727
 upon one of my sons; therefore, I say no more. And

115
00:04:55,727 --> 00:04:56,06
 may the Lord bless my people. Amen.
