00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 10 King Laman dies—His people

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
are wild and ferocious and believe in

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
false traditions—Zeniff and his people

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:03:45,
prevail against them. About 187–160 B.C. 

5
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
1 And it came to pass that we again

6
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
began to establish the kingdom and we

7
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
again began to possess the land in

8
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
peace. And I caused that there should be

9
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
weapons of war made of every kind, that

10
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
thereby I might have weapons for my

11
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
people against the time the Lamanites

12
00:03:45,0 --> 00:17:25,
should come up again to war against my people.

13
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
2 And I set guards round about the

14
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
land, that the Lamanites might not

15
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
come upon us again unawares and

16
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
destroy us; and thus I did guard my people

17
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
and my flocks, and keep them from

18
00:17:25,0 --> 00:19:09,
falling into the hands of our enemies.

19
00:19:09,0 --> 00:19:09,0
3 And it came to pass that we

20
00:19:09,0 --> 00:19:09,0
did inherit the land of our

21
00:19:09,0 --> 00:19:09,0
fathers for many years, yea, for

22
00:19:09,0 --> 00:21:21,
the space of twenty and two years.

23
00:21:21,0 --> 00:21:21,0
4 And I did cause that the men

24
00:21:21,0 --> 00:21:21,0
should till the ground, and

25
00:21:21,0 --> 00:21:21,0
raise all manner of grain and

26
00:21:21,0 --> 00:28:29,
all manner of fruit of every kind.

27
00:28:29,0 --> 00:28:29,0
5 And I did cause that the

28
00:28:29,0 --> 00:28:29,0
women should spin, and toil,

29
00:28:29,0 --> 00:28:29,0
and work, and work all

30
00:28:29,0 --> 00:28:29,0
manner of fine linen, yea, and

31
00:28:29,0 --> 00:28:29,0
cloth of every kind, that we

32
00:28:29,0 --> 00:28:29,0
might clothe our nakedness;

33
00:28:29,0 --> 00:28:29,0
and thus we did prosper in

34
00:28:29,0 --> 00:28:29,0
the land—thus we did have

35
00:28:29,0 --> 00:28:29,0
continual peace in the land for

36
00:28:29,0 --> 00:34:11,
the space of twenty and two years.

37
00:34:11,0 --> 00:34:11,0
6 And it came to pass that

38
00:34:11,0 --> 00:34:11,0
king Laman died, and his

39
00:34:11,0 --> 00:34:11,0
son began to reign in his

40
00:34:11,0 --> 00:34:11,0
stead. And he began to

41
00:34:11,0 --> 00:34:11,0
stir his people up in

42
00:34:11,0 --> 00:34:11,0
rebellion against my people;

43
00:34:11,0 --> 00:34:11,0
therefore they began to

44
00:34:11,0 --> 00:34:11,0
prepare for war, and to come up

45
00:34:11,0 --> 00:37:56,
to battle against my people.

46
00:37:56,0 --> 00:37:56,0
7 But I had sent my

47
00:37:56,0 --> 00:37:56,0
spies out round about the

48
00:37:56,0 --> 00:37:56,0
land of Shemlon, that I

49
00:37:56,0 --> 00:37:56,0
might discover their

50
00:37:56,0 --> 00:37:56,0
preparations, that I might

51
00:37:56,0 --> 00:37:56,0
guard against them, that

52
00:37:56,0 --> 00:37:56,0
they might not come upon

53
00:37:56,0 --> 00:41:27,
my people and destroy them.

54
00:41:27,0 --> 00:41:27,0
8 And it came to pass

55
00:41:27,0 --> 00:41:27,0
that they came up upon

56
00:41:27,0 --> 00:41:27,0
the north of the land of

57
00:41:27,0 --> 00:41:27,0
Shilom, with their

58
00:41:27,0 --> 00:41:27,0
numerous hosts, men armed

59
00:41:27,0 --> 00:41:27,0
with bows, and with

60
00:41:27,0 --> 00:41:27,0
arrows, and with swords,

61
00:41:27,0 --> 00:41:27,0
and with cimeters, and

62
00:41:27,0 --> 00:41:27,0
with stones, and with

63
00:41:27,0 --> 00:41:27,0
slings; and they had

64
00:41:27,0 --> 00:41:27,0
their heads shaved that

65
00:41:27,0 --> 00:41:27,0
they were naked; and they

66
00:41:27,0 --> 00:41:27,0
were girded with a

67
00:41:27,0 --> 00:46:38,
leathern girdle about their loins.

68
00:46:38,0 --> 00:46:38,0
9 And it came to pass

69
00:46:38,0 --> 00:46:38,0
that I caused that the

70
00:46:38,0 --> 00:46:38,0
women and children of

71
00:46:38,0 --> 00:46:38,0
my people should be

72
00:46:38,0 --> 00:46:38,0
hid in the wilderness;

73
00:46:38,0 --> 00:46:38,0
and I also caused that

74
00:46:38,0 --> 00:46:38,0
all my old men that

75
00:46:38,0 --> 00:46:38,0
could bear arms, and

76
00:46:38,0 --> 00:46:38,0
also all my young men

77
00:46:38,0 --> 00:46:38,0
that were able to bear

78
00:46:38,0 --> 00:46:38,0
arms, should gather

79
00:46:38,0 --> 00:46:38,0
themselves together to go

80
00:46:38,0 --> 00:46:38,0
to battle against the

81
00:46:38,0 --> 00:46:38,0
Lamanites; and I did

82
00:46:38,0 --> 00:46:38,0
place them in their

83
00:46:38,0 --> 00:50:23,
ranks, every man according to his age.

84
00:50:23,0 --> 00:50:23,0
10 And it came to

85
00:50:23,0 --> 00:50:23,0
pass that we did go up

86
00:50:23,0 --> 00:50:23,0
to battle against

87
00:50:23,0 --> 00:50:23,0
the Lamanites; and I,

88
00:50:23,0 --> 00:50:23,0
even I, in my old

89
00:50:23,0 --> 00:50:23,0
age, did go up to

90
00:50:23,0 --> 00:50:23,0
battle against the

91
00:50:23,0 --> 00:50:23,0
Lamanites. And it came

92
00:50:23,0 --> 00:50:23,0
to pass that we did

93
00:50:23,0 --> 00:50:23,0
go up in the strength

94
00:50:23,0 --> 00:51:07,
of the Lord to battle.

95
00:51:07,0 --> 00:51:07,0
11 Now, the

96
00:51:07,0 --> 00:51:07,0
Lamanites knew nothing

97
00:51:07,0 --> 00:51:07,0
concerning the Lord,

98
00:51:07,0 --> 00:51:07,0
nor the strength of

99
00:51:07,0 --> 00:51:07,0
the Lord, therefore

100
00:51:07,0 --> 00:51:07,0
they depended upon

101
00:51:07,0 --> 00:51:07,0
their own

102
00:51:07,0 --> 00:51:07,0
strength. Yet they were a

103
00:51:07,0 --> 00:51:07,0
strong people, as to

104
00:51:07,0 --> 00:51:37,
the strength of men.

105
00:51:37,0 --> 00:51:37,0
12 They were a

106
00:51:37,0 --> 00:51:37,0
wild, and ferocious,

107
00:51:37,0 --> 00:51:37,0
and a blood-thirsty

108
00:51:37,0 --> 00:51:37,0
people, believing in

109
00:51:37,0 --> 00:51:37,0
the tradition of

110
00:51:37,0 --> 00:51:37,0
their fathers, which

111
00:51:37,0 --> 00:51:37,0
is this—Believing

112
00:51:37,0 --> 00:51:37,0
that they were

113
00:51:37,0 --> 00:51:37,0
driven out of the land

114
00:51:37,0 --> 00:51:37,0
of Jerusalem

115
00:51:37,0 --> 00:51:37,0
because of the iniquities

116
00:51:37,0 --> 00:51:37,0
of their fathers,

117
00:51:37,0 --> 00:51:37,0
and that they were

118
00:51:37,0 --> 00:51:37,0
wronged in the

119
00:51:37,0 --> 00:51:37,0
wilderness by their

120
00:51:37,0 --> 00:51:37,0
brethren, and they

121
00:51:37,0 --> 00:51:37,0
were also wronged

122
00:51:37,0 --> 00:57:05,
while crossing the sea;

123
00:57:05,0 --> 00:57:05,0
13 And again, that

124
00:57:05,0 --> 00:57:05,0
they were wronged

125
00:57:05,0 --> 00:57:05,0
while in the land

126
00:57:05,0 --> 00:57:05,0
of their first

127
00:57:05,0 --> 00:57:05,0
inheritance, after

128
00:57:05,0 --> 00:57:05,0
they had crossed

129
00:57:05,0 --> 00:57:05,0
the sea, and all

130
00:57:05,0 --> 00:57:05,0
this because that

131
00:57:05,0 --> 00:57:05,0
Nephi was more

132
00:57:05,0 --> 00:57:05,0
faithful in keeping the

133
00:57:05,0 --> 00:57:05,0
commandments of

134
00:57:05,0 --> 00:57:05,0
the Lord—therefore

135
00:57:05,0 --> 00:57:05,0
he was favored of

136
00:57:05,0 --> 00:57:05,0
the Lord, for the

137
00:57:05,0 --> 00:57:05,0
Lord heard his

138
00:57:05,0 --> 00:57:05,0
prayers and answered

139
00:57:05,0 --> 00:57:05,0
them, and he took

140
00:57:05,0 --> 00:57:05,0
the lead of their

141
00:57:05,0 --> 01:00:15,
journey in the wilderness.

142
01:00:15,0 --> 01:00:15,0
14 And his

143
01:00:15,0 --> 01:00:15,0
brethren were wroth

144
01:00:15,0 --> 01:00:15,0
with him because

145
01:00:15,0 --> 01:00:15,0
they understood not

146
01:00:15,0 --> 01:00:15,0
the dealings of

147
01:00:15,0 --> 01:00:15,0
the Lord; they

148
01:00:15,0 --> 01:00:15,0
were also wroth with

149
01:00:15,0 --> 01:00:15,0
him upon the

150
01:00:15,0 --> 01:00:15,0
waters because they

151
01:00:15,0 --> 01:00:15,0
hardened their

152
01:00:15,0 --> 01:02:57,
hearts against the Lord.

153
01:02:57,0 --> 01:02:57,0
15 And again,

154
01:02:57,0 --> 01:02:57,0
they were wroth

155
01:02:57,0 --> 01:02:57,0
with him when they

156
01:02:57,0 --> 01:02:57,0
had arrived in

157
01:02:57,0 --> 01:02:57,0
the promised

158
01:02:57,0 --> 01:02:57,0
land, because they

159
01:02:57,0 --> 01:02:57,0
said that he had

160
01:02:57,0 --> 01:02:57,0
taken the

161
01:02:57,0 --> 01:02:57,0
ruling of the people

162
01:02:57,0 --> 01:02:57,0
out of their

163
01:02:57,0 --> 01:02:57,0
hands; and they

164
01:02:57,0 --> 01:07:10,
sought to kill him.

165
01:07:10,0 --> 01:07:10,0
16 And again,

166
01:07:10,0 --> 01:07:10,0
they were

167
01:07:10,0 --> 01:07:10,0
wroth with him

168
01:07:10,0 --> 01:07:10,0
because he

169
01:07:10,0 --> 01:07:10,0
departed into the

170
01:07:10,0 --> 01:07:10,0
wilderness as

171
01:07:10,0 --> 01:07:10,0
the Lord had

172
01:07:10,0 --> 01:07:10,0
commanded him,

173
01:07:10,0 --> 01:07:10,0
and took the

174
01:07:10,0 --> 01:07:10,0
records which

175
01:07:10,0 --> 01:07:10,0
were engraven on

176
01:07:10,0 --> 01:07:10,0
the plates of

177
01:07:10,0 --> 01:07:10,0
brass, for

178
01:07:10,0 --> 01:06:42,
they said that he robbed them.

179
01:06:42,0 --> 01:06:42,0
17 And thus

180
01:06:42,0 --> 01:06:42,0
they have

181
01:06:42,0 --> 01:06:42,0
taught their

182
01:06:42,0 --> 01:06:42,0
children that

183
01:06:42,0 --> 01:06:42,0
they should hate

184
01:06:42,0 --> 01:06:42,0
them, and

185
01:06:42,0 --> 01:06:42,0
that they

186
01:06:42,0 --> 01:06:42,0
should murder

187
01:06:42,0 --> 01:06:42,0
them, and that

188
01:06:42,0 --> 01:06:42,0
they should rob

189
01:06:42,0 --> 01:06:42,0
and plunder

190
01:06:42,0 --> 01:06:42,0
them, and do

191
01:06:42,0 --> 01:06:42,0
all they

192
01:06:42,0 --> 01:06:42,0
could to destroy

193
01:06:42,0 --> 01:06:42,0
them;

194
01:06:42,0 --> 01:06:42,0
therefore they have

195
01:06:42,0 --> 01:06:42,0
an eternal

196
01:06:42,0 --> 01:06:42,0
hatred towards

197
01:06:42,0 --> 01:07:26,
the children of Nephi.

198
01:07:26,0 --> 01:07:26,0
18 For this

199
01:07:26,0 --> 01:07:26,0
very cause

200
01:07:26,0 --> 01:07:26,0
has king

201
01:07:26,0 --> 01:07:26,0
Laman, by his

202
01:07:26,0 --> 01:07:26,0
cunning, and

203
01:07:26,0 --> 01:07:26,0
lying

204
01:07:26,0 --> 01:07:26,0
craftiness, and his

205
01:07:26,0 --> 01:07:26,0
fair

206
01:07:26,0 --> 01:07:26,0
promises, deceived

207
01:07:26,0 --> 01:07:26,0
me, that I

208
01:07:26,0 --> 01:07:26,0
have brought

209
01:07:26,0 --> 01:07:26,0
this my

210
01:07:26,0 --> 01:07:26,0
people up into

211
01:07:26,0 --> 01:07:26,0
this land,

212
01:07:26,0 --> 01:07:26,0
that they may

213
01:07:26,0 --> 01:07:26,0
destroy

214
01:07:26,0 --> 01:07:26,0
them; yea, and

215
01:07:26,0 --> 01:07:26,0
we have

216
01:07:26,0 --> 01:07:26,0
suffered these

217
01:07:26,0 --> 01:09:10,
many years in the land.

218
01:09:10,0 --> 01:09:10,0
19 And now

219
01:09:10,0 --> 01:09:10,0
I, Zeniff,

220
01:09:10,0 --> 01:09:10,0
after

221
01:09:10,0 --> 01:09:10,0
having told all

222
01:09:10,0 --> 01:09:10,0
these

223
01:09:10,0 --> 01:09:10,0
things unto my

224
01:09:10,0 --> 01:09:10,0
people

225
01:09:10,0 --> 01:09:10,0
concerning the

226
01:09:10,0 --> 01:09:10,0
Lamanites, I

227
01:09:10,0 --> 01:09:10,0
did

228
01:09:10,0 --> 01:09:10,0
stimulate them to

229
01:09:10,0 --> 01:09:10,0
go to

230
01:09:10,0 --> 01:09:10,0
battle with

231
01:09:10,0 --> 01:09:10,0
their might,

232
01:09:10,0 --> 01:09:10,0
putting

233
01:09:10,0 --> 01:09:10,0
their trust in

234
01:09:10,0 --> 01:09:10,0
the Lord;

235
01:09:10,0 --> 01:09:10,0
therefore,

236
01:09:10,0 --> 01:09:10,0
we did

237
01:09:10,0 --> 01:08:42,
contend with them, face to face.

238
01:08:42,0 --> 01:08:42,0
20 And it

239
01:08:42,0 --> 01:08:42,0
came to

240
01:08:42,0 --> 01:08:42,0
pass that we

241
01:08:42,0 --> 01:08:42,0
did drive

242
01:08:42,0 --> 01:08:42,0
them

243
01:08:42,0 --> 01:08:42,0
again out of

244
01:08:42,0 --> 01:08:42,0
our land;

245
01:08:42,0 --> 01:08:42,0
and we slew

246
01:08:42,0 --> 01:08:42,0
them with

247
01:08:42,0 --> 01:08:42,0
a great

248
01:08:42,0 --> 01:08:42,0
slaughter,

249
01:08:42,0 --> 01:08:42,0
even so

250
01:08:42,0 --> 01:08:42,0
many that we

251
01:08:42,0 --> 01:16:11,
did not number them.

252
01:16:11,0 --> 01:16:11,0
21 And it

253
01:16:11,0 --> 01:16:11,0
came to

254
01:16:11,0 --> 01:16:11,0
pass that

255
01:16:11,0 --> 01:16:11,0
we

256
01:16:11,0 --> 01:16:11,0
returned again

257
01:16:11,0 --> 01:16:11,0
to our

258
01:16:11,0 --> 01:16:11,0
own land,

259
01:16:11,0 --> 01:16:11,0
and my

260
01:16:11,0 --> 01:16:11,0
people

261
01:16:11,0 --> 01:16:11,0
again began

262
01:16:11,0 --> 01:16:11,0
to tend

263
01:16:11,0 --> 01:16:11,0
their

264
01:16:11,0 --> 01:16:11,0
flocks, and to

265
01:16:11,0 --> 01:23:40,
till their ground.

266
01:23:40,0 --> 01:23:40,0
22 And

267
01:23:40,0 --> 01:23:40,0
now I,

268
01:23:40,0 --> 01:23:40,0
being old,

269
01:23:40,0 --> 01:23:40,0
did confer

270
01:23:40,0 --> 01:23:40,0
the

271
01:23:40,0 --> 01:23:40,0
kingdom upon

272
01:23:40,0 --> 01:23:40,0
one of my

273
01:23:40,0 --> 01:23:40,0
sons;

274
01:23:40,0 --> 01:23:40,0
therefore, I

275
01:23:40,0 --> 01:23:40,0
say no

276
01:23:40,0 --> 01:23:40,0
more. And

277
01:23:40,0 --> 01:23:40,0
may the

278
01:23:40,0 --> 01:23:40,0
Lord bless

279
01:23:40,0 --> 01:23:40,0
my

280
01:23:40,0 --> 01:23:12,
people. Amen.
