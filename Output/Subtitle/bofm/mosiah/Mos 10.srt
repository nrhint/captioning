00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:05,5
Chapter 10 King Laman dies—His people

2
00:00:05,5 --> 00:00:11,0
are wild and ferocious and believe in

3
00:00:11,0 --> 00:00:16,5
false traditions—Zeniff and his people

4
00:00:16,5 --> 00:00:22,256
prevail against them. About 187–160 B.C. 

5
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:23,881
1 And it came to pass that we again

6
00:00:23,881 --> 00:00:25,506
began to establish the kingdom and we

7
00:00:25,506 --> 00:00:27,131
again began to possess the land in

8
00:00:27,131 --> 00:00:28,756
peace. And I caused that there should be

9
00:00:28,756 --> 00:00:30,381
weapons of war made of every kind, that

10
00:00:30,381 --> 00:00:32,006
thereby I might have weapons for my

11
00:00:32,006 --> 00:00:33,631
people against the time the Lamanites

12
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:35,602
should come up again to war against my people.

13
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:36,435
2 And I set guards round about the

14
00:00:36,435 --> 00:00:37,268
land, that the Lamanites might not

15
00:00:37,268 --> 00:00:38,101
come upon us again unawares and

16
00:00:38,101 --> 00:00:38,934
destroy us; and thus I did guard my people

17
00:00:38,934 --> 00:00:39,767
and my flocks, and keep them from

18
00:00:39,767 --> 00:00:40,007
falling into the hands of our enemies.

19
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:39,757
3 And it came to pass that we

20
00:00:39,757 --> 00:00:39,507
did inherit the land of our

21
00:00:39,507 --> 00:00:39,257
fathers for many years, yea, for

22
00:00:39,257 --> 00:00:39,072
the space of twenty and two years.

23
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:38,822
4 And I did cause that the men

24
00:00:38,822 --> 00:00:38,572
should till the ground, and

25
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:38,322
raise all manner of grain and

26
00:00:38,322 --> 00:00:38,138
all manner of fruit of every kind.

27
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:38,538
5 And I did cause that the

28
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:38,938
women should spin, and toil,

29
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:39,338
and work, and work all

30
00:00:39,338 --> 00:00:39,738
manner of fine linen, yea, and

31
00:00:39,738 --> 00:00:40,138
cloth of every kind, that we

32
00:00:40,138 --> 00:00:40,538
might clothe our nakedness;

33
00:00:40,538 --> 00:00:40,938
and thus we did prosper in

34
00:00:40,938 --> 00:00:41,338
the land—thus we did have

35
00:00:41,338 --> 00:00:41,738
continual peace in the land for

36
00:00:41,738 --> 00:00:42,543
the space of twenty and two years.

37
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:42,987
6 And it came to pass that

38
00:00:42,987 --> 00:00:43,431
king Laman died, and his

39
00:00:43,431 --> 00:00:43,875
son began to reign in his

40
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:44,319
stead. And he began to

41
00:00:44,319 --> 00:00:44,763
stir his people up in

42
00:00:44,763 --> 00:00:45,207
rebellion against my people;

43
00:00:45,207 --> 00:00:45,651
therefore they began to

44
00:00:45,651 --> 00:00:46,095
prepare for war, and to come up

45
00:00:46,095 --> 00:00:46,947
to battle against my people.

46
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:49,822
7 But I had sent my

47
00:00:49,822 --> 00:00:52,697
spies out round about the

48
00:00:52,697 --> 00:00:55,572
land of Shemlon, that I

49
00:00:55,572 --> 00:00:58,447
might discover their

50
00:00:58,447 --> 00:01:01,322
preparations, that I might

51
00:01:01,322 --> 00:01:04,197
guard against them, that

52
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:07,072
they might not come upon

53
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:09,202
my people and destroy them.

54
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:09,702
8 And it came to pass

55
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:10,202
that they came up upon

56
00:01:10,202 --> 00:01:10,702
the north of the land of

57
00:01:10,702 --> 00:01:11,202
Shilom, with their

58
00:01:11,202 --> 00:01:11,702
numerous hosts, men armed

59
00:01:11,702 --> 00:01:12,202
with bows, and with

60
00:01:12,202 --> 00:01:12,702
arrows, and with swords,

61
00:01:12,702 --> 00:01:13,202
and with cimeters, and

62
00:01:13,202 --> 00:01:13,702
with stones, and with

63
00:01:13,702 --> 00:01:14,202
slings; and they had

64
00:01:14,202 --> 00:01:14,702
their heads shaved that

65
00:01:14,702 --> 00:01:15,202
they were naked; and they

66
00:01:15,202 --> 00:01:15,702
were girded with a

67
00:01:15,702 --> 00:01:16,71
leathern girdle about their loins.

68
00:01:16,71 --> 00:01:17,585
9 And it came to pass

69
00:01:17,585 --> 00:01:18,46
that I caused that the

70
00:01:18,46 --> 00:01:19,335
women and children of

71
00:01:19,335 --> 00:01:20,21
my people should be

72
00:01:20,21 --> 00:01:21,085
hid in the wilderness;

73
00:01:21,085 --> 00:01:21,96
and I also caused that

74
00:01:21,96 --> 00:01:22,835
all my old men that

75
00:01:22,835 --> 00:01:23,71
could bear arms, and

76
00:01:23,71 --> 00:01:24,585
also all my young men

77
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:25,46
that were able to bear

78
00:01:25,46 --> 00:01:26,335
arms, should gather

79
00:01:26,335 --> 00:01:27,21
themselves together to go

80
00:01:27,21 --> 00:01:28,085
to battle against the

81
00:01:28,085 --> 00:01:28,96
Lamanites; and I did

82
00:01:28,96 --> 00:01:29,835
place them in their

83
00:01:29,835 --> 00:01:30,524
ranks, every man according to his age.

84
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:30,524
10 And it came to

85
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:30,524
pass that we did go up

86
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:30,524
to battle against

87
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:30,524
the Lamanites; and I,

88
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:30,524
even I, in my old

89
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:30,524
age, did go up to

90
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:30,524
battle against the

91
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:30,524
Lamanites. And it came

92
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:30,524
to pass that we did

93
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:30,524
go up in the strength

94
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:30,057
of the Lord to battle.

95
00:01:30,057 --> 00:01:29,957
11 Now, the

96
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:29,857
Lamanites knew nothing

97
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:29,757
concerning the Lord,

98
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:29,657
nor the strength of

99
00:01:29,657 --> 00:01:29,557
the Lord, therefore

100
00:01:29,557 --> 00:01:29,457
they depended upon

101
00:01:29,457 --> 00:01:29,357
their own

102
00:01:29,357 --> 00:01:29,257
strength. Yet they were a

103
00:01:29,257 --> 00:01:29,157
strong people, as to

104
00:01:29,157 --> 00:01:29,122
the strength of men.

105
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:29,066
12 They were a

106
00:01:29,066 --> 00:01:29,01
wild, and ferocious,

107
00:01:29,01 --> 00:01:28,954
and a blood-thirsty

108
00:01:28,954 --> 00:01:28,898
people, believing in

109
00:01:28,898 --> 00:01:28,842
the tradition of

110
00:01:28,842 --> 00:01:28,786
their fathers, which

111
00:01:28,786 --> 00:01:28,73
is this—Believing

112
00:01:28,73 --> 00:01:28,674
that they were

113
00:01:28,674 --> 00:01:28,618
driven out of the land

114
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:28,562
of Jerusalem

115
00:01:28,562 --> 00:01:28,506
because of the iniquities

116
00:01:28,506 --> 00:01:28,45
of their fathers,

117
00:01:28,45 --> 00:01:28,394
and that they were

118
00:01:28,394 --> 00:01:28,338
wronged in the

119
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:28,282
wilderness by their

120
00:01:28,282 --> 00:01:28,226
brethren, and they

121
00:01:28,226 --> 00:01:28,17
were also wronged

122
00:01:28,17 --> 00:01:28,188
while crossing the sea;

123
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:28,82
13 And again, that

124
00:01:28,82 --> 00:01:29,452
they were wronged

125
00:01:29,452 --> 00:01:30,084
while in the land

126
00:01:30,084 --> 00:01:30,716
of their first

127
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:31,348
inheritance, after

128
00:01:31,348 --> 00:01:31,98
they had crossed

129
00:01:31,98 --> 00:01:32,612
the sea, and all

130
00:01:32,612 --> 00:01:33,244
this because that

131
00:01:33,244 --> 00:01:33,876
Nephi was more

132
00:01:33,876 --> 00:01:34,508
faithful in keeping the

133
00:01:34,508 --> 00:01:35,14
commandments of

134
00:01:35,14 --> 00:01:35,772
the Lord—therefore

135
00:01:35,772 --> 00:01:36,404
he was favored of

136
00:01:36,404 --> 00:01:37,036
the Lord, for the

137
00:01:37,036 --> 00:01:37,668
Lord heard his

138
00:01:37,668 --> 00:01:38,3
prayers and answered

139
00:01:38,3 --> 00:01:38,932
them, and he took

140
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:39,564
the lead of their

141
00:01:39,564 --> 00:01:40,534
journey in the wilderness.

142
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:41,443
14 And his

143
00:01:41,443 --> 00:01:42,352
brethren were wroth

144
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,261
with him because

145
00:01:43,261 --> 00:01:44,17
they understood not

146
00:01:44,17 --> 00:01:45,079
the dealings of

147
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:45,988
the Lord; they

148
00:01:45,988 --> 00:01:46,897
were also wroth with

149
00:01:46,897 --> 00:01:47,806
him upon the

150
00:01:47,806 --> 00:01:48,715
waters because they

151
00:01:48,715 --> 00:01:49,624
hardened their

152
00:01:49,624 --> 00:01:50,444
hearts against the Lord.

153
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:50,611
15 And again,

154
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:50,778
they were wroth

155
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:50,945
with him when they

156
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:51,112
had arrived in

157
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:51,279
the promised

158
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:51,446
land, because they

159
00:01:51,446 --> 00:01:51,613
said that he had

160
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:51,78
taken the

161
00:01:51,78 --> 00:01:51,947
ruling of the people

162
00:01:51,947 --> 00:01:52,114
out of their

163
00:01:52,114 --> 00:01:52,281
hands; and they

164
00:01:52,281 --> 00:01:52,379
sought to kill him.

165
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:52,95
16 And again,

166
00:01:52,95 --> 00:01:53,521
they were

167
00:01:53,521 --> 00:01:54,092
wroth with him

168
00:01:54,092 --> 00:01:54,663
because he

169
00:01:54,663 --> 00:01:55,234
departed into the

170
00:01:55,234 --> 00:01:55,805
wilderness as

171
00:01:55,805 --> 00:01:56,376
the Lord had

172
00:01:56,376 --> 00:01:56,947
commanded him,

173
00:01:56,947 --> 00:01:57,518
and took the

174
00:01:57,518 --> 00:01:58,089
records which

175
00:01:58,089 --> 00:01:58,66
were engraven on

176
00:01:58,66 --> 00:01:59,231
the plates of

177
00:01:59,231 --> 00:01:59,802
brass, for

178
00:01:59,802 --> 00:02:00,354
they said that he robbed them.

179
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:01,301
17 And thus

180
00:02:01,301 --> 00:02:02,248
they have

181
00:02:02,248 --> 00:02:03,195
taught their

182
00:02:03,195 --> 00:02:04,142
children that

183
00:02:04,142 --> 00:02:05,089
they should hate

184
00:02:05,089 --> 00:02:06,036
them, and

185
00:02:06,036 --> 00:02:06,983
that they

186
00:02:06,983 --> 00:02:07,93
should murder

187
00:02:07,93 --> 00:02:08,877
them, and that

188
00:02:08,877 --> 00:02:09,824
they should rob

189
00:02:09,824 --> 00:02:10,771
and plunder

190
00:02:10,771 --> 00:02:11,718
them, and do

191
00:02:11,718 --> 00:02:12,665
all they

192
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:13,612
could to destroy

193
00:02:13,612 --> 00:02:14,559
them;

194
00:02:14,559 --> 00:02:15,506
therefore they have

195
00:02:15,506 --> 00:02:16,453
an eternal

196
00:02:16,453 --> 00:02:17,4
hatred towards

197
00:02:17,4 --> 00:02:18,705
the children of Nephi.

198
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:18,855
18 For this

199
00:02:18,855 --> 00:02:19,005
very cause

200
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:19,155
has king

201
00:02:19,155 --> 00:02:19,305
Laman, by his

202
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:19,455
cunning, and

203
00:02:19,455 --> 00:02:19,605
lying

204
00:02:19,605 --> 00:02:19,755
craftiness, and his

205
00:02:19,755 --> 00:02:19,905
fair

206
00:02:19,905 --> 00:02:20,055
promises, deceived

207
00:02:20,055 --> 00:02:20,205
me, that I

208
00:02:20,205 --> 00:02:20,355
have brought

209
00:02:20,355 --> 00:02:20,505
this my

210
00:02:20,505 --> 00:02:20,655
people up into

211
00:02:20,655 --> 00:02:20,805
this land,

212
00:02:20,805 --> 00:02:20,955
that they may

213
00:02:20,955 --> 00:02:21,105
destroy

214
00:02:21,105 --> 00:02:21,255
them; yea, and

215
00:02:21,255 --> 00:02:21,405
we have

216
00:02:21,405 --> 00:02:21,555
suffered these

217
00:02:21,555 --> 00:02:21,108
many years in the land.

218
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:22,758
19 And now

219
00:02:22,758 --> 00:02:24,408
I, Zeniff,

220
00:02:24,408 --> 00:02:26,058
after

221
00:02:26,058 --> 00:02:27,708
having told all

222
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:29,358
these

223
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,008
things unto my

224
00:02:31,008 --> 00:02:32,658
people

225
00:02:32,658 --> 00:02:34,308
concerning the

226
00:02:34,308 --> 00:02:35,958
Lamanites, I

227
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:37,608
did

228
00:02:37,608 --> 00:02:39,258
stimulate them to

229
00:02:39,258 --> 00:02:40,908
go to

230
00:02:40,908 --> 00:02:42,558
battle with

231
00:02:42,558 --> 00:02:44,208
their might,

232
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:45,858
putting

233
00:02:45,858 --> 00:02:47,508
their trust in

234
00:02:47,508 --> 00:02:49,158
the Lord;

235
00:02:49,158 --> 00:02:50,808
therefore,

236
00:02:50,808 --> 00:02:52,458
we did

237
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,908
contend with them, face to face.

238
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:55,408
20 And it

239
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:55,908
came to

240
00:02:55,908 --> 00:02:56,408
pass that we

241
00:02:56,408 --> 00:02:56,908
did drive

242
00:02:56,908 --> 00:02:57,408
them

243
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:57,908
again out of

244
00:02:57,908 --> 00:02:58,408
our land;

245
00:02:58,408 --> 00:02:58,908
and we slew

246
00:02:58,908 --> 00:02:59,408
them with

247
00:02:59,408 --> 00:02:59,908
a great

248
00:02:59,908 --> 00:03:00,408
slaughter,

249
00:03:00,408 --> 00:03:00,908
even so

250
00:03:00,908 --> 00:03:01,408
many that we

251
00:03:01,408 --> 00:03:01,948
did not number them.

252
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:02,234
21 And it

253
00:03:02,234 --> 00:03:02,52
came to

254
00:03:02,52 --> 00:03:02,806
pass that

255
00:03:02,806 --> 00:03:03,092
we

256
00:03:03,092 --> 00:03:03,378
returned again

257
00:03:03,378 --> 00:03:03,664
to our

258
00:03:03,664 --> 00:03:03,95
own land,

259
00:03:03,95 --> 00:03:04,236
and my

260
00:03:04,236 --> 00:03:04,522
people

261
00:03:04,522 --> 00:03:04,808
again began

262
00:03:04,808 --> 00:03:05,094
to tend

263
00:03:05,094 --> 00:03:05,38
their

264
00:03:05,38 --> 00:03:05,666
flocks, and to

265
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:05,419
till their ground.

266
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:06,886
22 And

267
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:08,353
now I,

268
00:03:08,353 --> 00:03:09,82
being old,

269
00:03:09,82 --> 00:03:11,287
did confer

270
00:03:11,287 --> 00:03:12,754
the

271
00:03:12,754 --> 00:03:14,221
kingdom upon

272
00:03:14,221 --> 00:03:15,688
one of my

273
00:03:15,688 --> 00:03:17,155
sons;

274
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,622
therefore, I

275
00:03:18,622 --> 00:03:20,089
say no

276
00:03:20,089 --> 00:03:21,556
more. And

277
00:03:21,556 --> 00:03:23,023
may the

278
00:03:23,023 --> 00:03:24,49
Lord bless

279
00:03:24,49 --> 00:03:25,957
my

280
00:03:25,957 --> 00:03:27,708
people. Amen.
