00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,4
Chapter 24 Amulon persecutes Alma and his

2
00:00:01,4 --> 00:00:02,8
 people—They are to be put to death if they pray—The Lord

3
00:00:02,8 --> 00:00:04,2
 makes their burdens seem light—He delivers them

4
00:00:04,2 --> 00:00:05,6
 from bondage, and they return to Zarahemla. About

5
00:00:05,6 --> 00:00:07,0
 145–120 B.C.

6
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:10,261
1 And it came to pass that Amulon did gain favor

7
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:12,547
 in the eyes of the king of the Lamanites;

8
00:00:12,547 --> 00:00:14,833
 therefore, the king of the Lamanites granted unto him and

9
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:17,119
 his brethren that they should be appointed teachers

10
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,405
 over his people, yea, even over the people who

11
00:00:19,405 --> 00:00:21,691
 were in the land of Shemlon, and in the land of

12
00:00:21,691 --> 00:00:23,977
 Shilom, and in the land of Amulon

13
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:26,591
2 For the Lamanites had taken possession of all

14
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:29,258
 these lands; therefore, the king of the Lamanites

15
00:00:29,258 --> 00:00:31,925
 had appointed kings over all these lands

16
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,899
3 And now the name of the king of the Lamanites

17
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,899
 was Laman, being called after the name of his

18
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:37,899
 father; and therefore he was called king Laman. And he

19
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:39,899
 was king over a numerous people

20
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,873
4 And he appointed teachers of the brethren of

21
00:00:41,873 --> 00:00:43,873
 Amulon in every land which was possessed by his

22
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:45,873
 people; and thus the language of Nephi began to be

23
00:00:45,873 --> 00:00:47,873
 taught among all the people of the Lamanites

24
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,448
5 And they were a people friendly one with

25
00:00:49,448 --> 00:00:51,048
 another; nevertheless they knew not God; neither did the

26
00:00:51,048 --> 00:00:52,648
 brethren of Amulon teach them anything concerning

27
00:00:52,648 --> 00:00:54,248
 the Lord their God, neither the law of Moses; nor

28
00:00:54,248 --> 00:00:55,848
 did they teach them the words of Abinadi

29
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:58,489
6 But they taught them that they should keep their

30
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:01,156
 record, and that they might write one to another

31
00:01:01,156 --> 00:01:03,823


32
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:04,94
7 And thus the Lamanites began to increase in

33
00:01:04,94 --> 00:01:06,083
 riches, and began to trade one with another and wax

34
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:07,226
 great, and began to be a cunning and a wise people,

35
00:01:07,226 --> 00:01:08,369
 as to the wisdom of the world, yea, a very cunning

36
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:09,512
 people, delighting in all manner of wickedness

37
00:01:09,512 --> 00:01:10,655
 and plunder, except it were among their own

38
00:01:10,655 --> 00:01:11,798
 brethren

39
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:13,772
8 And now it came to pass that Amulon began to

40
00:01:13,772 --> 00:01:15,772
 exercise authority over Alma and his brethren, and

41
00:01:15,772 --> 00:01:17,772
 began to persecute him, and cause that his children

42
00:01:17,772 --> 00:01:19,772
 should persecute their children

43
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:20,889
9 For Amulon knew Alma, that he had been one of

44
00:01:20,889 --> 00:01:22,032
 the king’s priests, and that it was he that believed

45
00:01:22,032 --> 00:01:23,175
 the words of Abinadi and was driven out before

46
00:01:23,175 --> 00:01:24,318
 the king, and therefore he was wroth with him; for

47
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:25,461
 he was subject to king Laman, yet he exercised

48
00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:26,604
 authority over them, and put tasks upon them, and put

49
00:01:26,604 --> 00:01:27,747
 task-masters over them

50
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:31,721
10 And it came to pass that so great were their

51
00:01:31,721 --> 00:01:35,721
 afflictions that they began to cry mightily to God

52
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,696
11 And Amulon commanded them that they should stop

53
00:01:37,696 --> 00:01:39,696
 their cries; and he put guards over them to watch

54
00:01:39,696 --> 00:01:41,696
 them, that whosoever should be found calling upon

55
00:01:41,696 --> 00:01:43,696
 God should be put to death

56
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:45,67
12 And Alma and his people did not raise their

57
00:01:45,67 --> 00:01:47,67
 voices to the Lord their God, but did pour out their

58
00:01:47,67 --> 00:01:49,67
 hearts to him; and he did know the thoughts of

59
00:01:49,67 --> 00:01:51,67
 their hearts

60
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:52,978
13 And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord

61
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:54,311
 came to them in their afflictions, saying: Lift up

62
00:01:54,311 --> 00:01:55,644
 your heads and be of good comfort, for I know of

63
00:01:55,644 --> 00:01:56,977
 the covenant which ye have made unto me; and I

64
00:01:56,977 --> 00:01:58,31
 will covenant with my people and deliver them out of

65
00:01:58,31 --> 00:01:59,643
 bondage

66
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:00,763
14 And I will also ease the burdens which are put

67
00:02:00,763 --> 00:02:01,906
 upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel

68
00:02:01,906 --> 00:02:03,049
 them upon your backs, even while you are in bondage;

69
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:04,192
 and this will I do that ye may stand as witnesses

70
00:02:04,192 --> 00:02:05,335
 for me hereafter, and that ye may know of a surety

71
00:02:05,335 --> 00:02:06,478
 that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their

72
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:07,621
 afflictions

73
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:08,927
15 And now it came to pass that the burdens which

74
00:02:08,927 --> 00:02:10,26
 were laid upon Alma and his brethren were made

75
00:02:10,26 --> 00:02:11,593
 light; yea, the Lord did strengthen them that they

76
00:02:11,593 --> 00:02:12,926
 could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did

77
00:02:12,926 --> 00:02:14,259
 submit cheerfully and with patience to all the

78
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,592
 will of the Lord

79
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:17,169
16 And it came to pass that so great was their

80
00:02:17,169 --> 00:02:18,769
 faith and their patience that the voice of the Lord

81
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:20,369
 came unto them again, saying: Be of good comfort,

82
00:02:20,369 --> 00:02:21,969
 for on the morrow I will deliver you out of

83
00:02:21,969 --> 00:02:23,569
 bondage

84
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:26,21
17 And he said unto Alma: Thou shalt go before

85
00:02:26,21 --> 00:02:28,877
 this people, and I will go with thee and deliver this

86
00:02:28,877 --> 00:02:31,544
 people out of bondage

87
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,518
18 Now it came to pass that Alma and his people in

88
00:02:33,518 --> 00:02:35,518
 the night-time gathered their flocks together,

89
00:02:35,518 --> 00:02:37,518
 and also of their grain; yea, even all the

90
00:02:37,518 --> 00:02:39,518
 night-time were they gathering their flocks together

91
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:42,16
19 And in the morning the Lord caused a deep sleep

92
00:02:42,16 --> 00:02:44,827
 to come upon the Lamanites, yea, and all their

93
00:02:44,827 --> 00:02:47,494
 task-masters were in a profound sleep

94
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,067
20 And Alma and his people departed into the

95
00:02:49,067 --> 00:02:50,667
 wilderness; and when they had traveled all day they

96
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:52,267
 pitched their tents in a valley, and they called the

97
00:02:52,267 --> 00:02:53,867
 valley Alma, because he led their way in the

98
00:02:53,867 --> 00:02:55,467
 wilderness

99
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:56,775
21 Yea, and in the valley of Alma they poured out

100
00:02:56,775 --> 00:02:58,108
 their thanks to God because he had been merciful

101
00:02:58,108 --> 00:02:59,441
 unto them, and eased their burdens, and had

102
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:00,774
 delivered them out of bondage; for they were in bondage,

103
00:03:00,774 --> 00:03:02,107
 and none could deliver them except it were the

104
00:03:02,107 --> 00:03:03,44
 Lord their God

105
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,417
22 And they gave thanks to God, yea, all their men

106
00:03:05,417 --> 00:03:07,417
 and all their women and all their children that

107
00:03:07,417 --> 00:03:09,417
 could speak lifted their voices in the praises of

108
00:03:09,417 --> 00:03:11,417
 their God

109
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:12,724
23 And now the Lord said unto Alma: Haste thee and

110
00:03:12,724 --> 00:03:14,057
 get thou and this people out of this land, for

111
00:03:14,057 --> 00:03:15,39
 the Lamanites have awakened and do pursue thee;

112
00:03:15,39 --> 00:03:16,723
 therefore get thee out of this land, and I will stop

113
00:03:16,723 --> 00:03:18,056
 the Lamanites in this valley that they come no

114
00:03:18,056 --> 00:03:19,389
 further in pursuit of this people

115
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:22,033
24 And it came to pass that they departed out of

116
00:03:22,033 --> 00:03:24,7
 the valley, and took their journey into the

117
00:03:24,7 --> 00:03:27,367
 wilderness

118
00:03:27,34 --> 00:03:30,007
25 And after they had been in the wilderness

119
00:03:30,007 --> 00:03:32,674
 twelve days they arrived in the land of Zarahemla; and

120
00:03:32,674 --> 00:03:35,341
 king Mosiah did also receive them with joy.
