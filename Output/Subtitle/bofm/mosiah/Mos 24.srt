00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:04,4
Chapter 24 Amulon persecutes Alma and his

2
00:00:04,4 --> 00:00:08,8
people—They are to be put to death if they

3
00:00:08,8 --> 00:00:13,2
pray—The Lord makes their burdens seem

4
00:00:13,2 --> 00:00:17,6
light—He delivers them from bondage, and

5
00:00:17,6 --> 00:00:22,956
they return to Zarahemla. About 145–120 B.C. 

6
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:24,831
1 And it came to pass that Amulon did

7
00:00:24,831 --> 00:00:26,706
gain favor in the eyes of the king of the

8
00:00:26,706 --> 00:00:28,581
Lamanites; therefore, the king of the

9
00:00:28,581 --> 00:00:30,456
Lamanites granted unto him and his brethren

10
00:00:30,456 --> 00:00:32,331
that they should be appointed teachers over

11
00:00:32,331 --> 00:00:34,206
his people, yea, even over the people

12
00:00:34,206 --> 00:00:36,081
who were in the land of Shemlon, and in the

13
00:00:36,081 --> 00:00:37,971
land of Shilom, and in the land of Amulon.

14
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:37,971
2 For the Lamanites had taken

15
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:37,971
possession of all these lands;

16
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:37,971
therefore, the king of the Lamanites had

17
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:37,037
appointed kings over all these lands.

18
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:37,704
3 And now the name of the king

19
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:38,371
of the Lamanites was Laman,

20
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:39,038
being called after the name of

21
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:39,705
his father; and therefore he

22
00:00:39,705 --> 00:00:40,372
was called king Laman. And he

23
00:00:40,372 --> 00:00:41,441
was king over a numerous people.

24
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:41,298
4 And he appointed teachers

25
00:00:41,298 --> 00:00:41,155
of the brethren of Amulon

26
00:00:41,155 --> 00:00:41,012
in every land which was

27
00:00:41,012 --> 00:00:40,869
possessed by his people; and

28
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:40,726
thus the language of Nephi

29
00:00:40,726 --> 00:00:40,583
began to be taught among all

30
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:40,507
the people of the Lamanites.

31
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:40,396
5 And they were a people

32
00:00:40,396 --> 00:00:40,285
friendly one with another;

33
00:00:40,285 --> 00:00:40,174
nevertheless they knew not

34
00:00:40,174 --> 00:00:40,063
God; neither did the

35
00:00:40,063 --> 00:00:39,952
brethren of Amulon teach them

36
00:00:39,952 --> 00:00:39,841
anything concerning the

37
00:00:39,841 --> 00:00:39,73
Lord their God, neither the

38
00:00:39,73 --> 00:00:39,619
law of Moses; nor did they

39
00:00:39,619 --> 00:00:39,573
teach them the words of Abinadi;

40
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
6 But they taught them

41
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
that they should keep their

42
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
record, and that they

43
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,106
might write one to another.

44
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
7 And thus the

45
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
Lamanites began to increase in

46
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
riches, and began to

47
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
trade one with another

48
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
and wax great, and began

49
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
to be a cunning and a

50
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
wise people, as to the

51
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
wisdom of the world,

52
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
yea, a very cunning

53
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
people, delighting in all

54
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
manner of wickedness and

55
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
plunder, except it were

56
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,573
among their own brethren.

57
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
8 And now it came to

58
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
pass that Amulon began

59
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
to exercise authority

60
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
over Alma and his

61
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
brethren, and began to

62
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
persecute him, and cause

63
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
that his children

64
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,106
should persecute their children.

65
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
9 For Amulon knew

66
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
Alma, that he had been

67
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
one of the king’s

68
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
priests, and that it was

69
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
he that believed the

70
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
words of Abinadi and

71
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
was driven out before

72
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
the king, and

73
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
therefore he was wroth with

74
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
him; for he was

75
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
subject to king Laman,

76
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
yet he exercised

77
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
authority over them, and

78
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
put tasks upon them,

79
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,573
and put task-masters over them.

80
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
10 And it came to

81
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
pass that so great

82
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
were their

83
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
afflictions that they began

84
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,106
to cry mightily to God.

85
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
11 And Amulon

86
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
commanded them that

87
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
they should stop

88
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
their cries; and

89
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
he put guards

90
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
over them to watch

91
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
them, that

92
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
whosoever should be

93
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
found calling upon

94
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,573
God should be put to death.

95
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
12 And Alma and

96
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
his people did

97
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
not raise their

98
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
voices to the

99
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
Lord their God, but

100
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
did pour out

101
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
their hearts to

102
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
him; and he did

103
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
know the thoughts

104
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,106
of their hearts.

105
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
13 And it came

106
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
to pass that

107
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
the voice of the

108
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
Lord came to

109
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
them in their

110
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
afflictions,

111
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
saying: Lift up your

112
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
heads and be

113
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
of good comfort,

114
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
for I know of

115
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
the covenant

116
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
which ye have

117
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
made unto me; and

118
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
I will covenant

119
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
with my people

120
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
and deliver

121
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,573
them out of bondage.

122
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
14 And I will

123
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
also ease the

124
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
burdens which

125
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
are put upon

126
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
your shoulders,

127
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
that even you

128
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
cannot feel

129
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
them upon your

130
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
backs, even

131
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
while you are in

132
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
bondage; and

133
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
this will I do

134
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
that ye may

135
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
stand as

136
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
witnesses for me

137
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
hereafter, and

138
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
that ye may know

139
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
of a surety

140
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
that I, the

141
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
Lord God, do

142
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,106
visit my people in their afflictions.

143
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
15 And now it

144
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
came to pass

145
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
that the

146
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
burdens which

147
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
were laid upon

148
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
Alma and his

149
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
brethren were

150
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
made light;

151
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
yea, the Lord

152
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
did

153
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
strengthen them that

154
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
they could

155
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
bear up their

156
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
burdens with

157
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
ease, and they

158
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
did submit

159
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
cheerfully and

160
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
with

161
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,573
patience to all the will of the Lord.

162
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
16 And it

163
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
came to pass

164
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
that so great

165
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
was their

166
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
faith and

167
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
their patience

168
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
that the

169
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
voice of the

170
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
Lord came unto

171
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
them again,

172
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
saying: Be

173
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
of good

174
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
comfort, for on

175
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
the morrow I

176
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
will

177
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,106
deliver you out of bondage.

178
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
17 And he

179
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
said unto

180
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
Alma: Thou

181
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
shalt go

182
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
before this

183
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
people, and I

184
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
will go

185
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
with thee and

186
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
deliver

187
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,106
this people

188
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:39,573
out of bondage.

189
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
18 Now it

190
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
came to

191
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
pass that

192
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
Alma and his

193
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
people in

194
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
the

195
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
night-time

196
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
gathered their

197
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
flocks

198
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
together,

199
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:39,573
