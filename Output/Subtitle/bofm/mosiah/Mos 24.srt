00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 24 Amulon persecutes Alma and his

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
people—They are to be put to death if they

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
pray—The Lord makes their burdens seem

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
light—He delivers them from bondage, and

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:13:55,
they return to Zarahemla. About 145–120 B.C. 

6
00:13:55,0 --> 00:13:55,0
1 And it came to pass that Amulon did

7
00:13:55,0 --> 00:13:55,0
gain favor in the eyes of the king of the

8
00:13:55,0 --> 00:13:55,0
Lamanites; therefore, the king of the

9
00:13:55,0 --> 00:13:55,0
Lamanites granted unto him and his brethren

10
00:13:55,0 --> 00:13:55,0
that they should be appointed teachers over

11
00:13:55,0 --> 00:13:55,0
his people, yea, even over the people

12
00:13:55,0 --> 00:13:55,0
who were in the land of Shemlon, and in the

13
00:13:55,0 --> 00:13:27,
land of Shilom, and in the land of Amulon.

14
00:13:27,0 --> 00:13:27,0
2 For the Lamanites had taken

15
00:13:27,0 --> 00:13:27,0
possession of all these lands;

16
00:13:27,0 --> 00:13:27,0
therefore, the king of the Lamanites had

17
00:13:27,0 --> 00:15:25,
appointed kings over all these lands.

18
00:15:25,0 --> 00:15:25,0
3 And now the name of the king

19
00:15:25,0 --> 00:15:25,0
of the Lamanites was Laman,

20
00:15:25,0 --> 00:15:25,0
being called after the name of

21
00:15:25,0 --> 00:15:25,0
his father; and therefore he

22
00:15:25,0 --> 00:15:25,0
was called king Laman. And he

23
00:15:25,0 --> 00:15:11,
was king over a numerous people.

24
00:15:11,0 --> 00:15:11,0
4 And he appointed teachers

25
00:15:11,0 --> 00:15:11,0
of the brethren of Amulon

26
00:15:11,0 --> 00:15:11,0
in every land which was

27
00:15:11,0 --> 00:15:11,0
possessed by his people; and

28
00:15:11,0 --> 00:15:11,0
thus the language of Nephi

29
00:15:11,0 --> 00:15:11,0
began to be taught among all

30
00:15:11,0 --> 00:18:42,
the people of the Lamanites.

31
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
5 And they were a people

32
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
friendly one with another;

33
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
nevertheless they knew not

34
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
God; neither did the

35
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
brethren of Amulon teach them

36
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
anything concerning the

37
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
Lord their God, neither the

38
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
law of Moses; nor did they

39
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,
teach them the words of Abinadi;

40
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
6 But they taught them

41
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
that they should keep their

42
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
record, and that they

43
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,
might write one to another.

44
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
7 And thus the

45
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
Lamanites began to increase in

46
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
riches, and began to

47
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
trade one with another

48
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
and wax great, and began

49
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
to be a cunning and a

50
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
wise people, as to the

51
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
wisdom of the world,

52
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
yea, a very cunning

53
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
people, delighting in all

54
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
manner of wickedness and

55
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
plunder, except it were

56
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,
among their own brethren.

57
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
8 And now it came to

58
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
pass that Amulon began

59
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
to exercise authority

60
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
over Alma and his

61
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
brethren, and began to

62
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
persecute him, and cause

63
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
that his children

64
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,
should persecute their children.

65
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
9 For Amulon knew

66
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
Alma, that he had been

67
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
one of the king’s

68
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
priests, and that it was

69
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
he that believed the

70
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
words of Abinadi and

71
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
was driven out before

72
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
the king, and

73
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
therefore he was wroth with

74
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
him; for he was

75
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
subject to king Laman,

76
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
yet he exercised

77
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
authority over them, and

78
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
put tasks upon them,

79
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,
and put task-masters over them.

80
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
10 And it came to

81
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
pass that so great

82
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
were their

83
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
afflictions that they began

84
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,
to cry mightily to God.

85
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
11 And Amulon

86
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
commanded them that

87
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
they should stop

88
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
their cries; and

89
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
he put guards

90
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
over them to watch

91
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
them, that

92
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
whosoever should be

93
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
found calling upon

94
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,
God should be put to death.

95
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
12 And Alma and

96
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
his people did

97
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
not raise their

98
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
voices to the

99
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
Lord their God, but

100
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
did pour out

101
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
their hearts to

102
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
him; and he did

103
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
know the thoughts

104
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,
of their hearts.

105
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
13 And it came

106
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
to pass that

107
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
the voice of the

108
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
Lord came to

109
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
them in their

110
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
afflictions,

111
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
saying: Lift up your

112
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
heads and be

113
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
of good comfort,

114
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
for I know of

115
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
the covenant

116
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
which ye have

117
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
made unto me; and

118
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
I will covenant

119
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
with my people

120
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
and deliver

121
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,
them out of bondage.

122
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
14 And I will

123
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
also ease the

124
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
burdens which

125
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
are put upon

126
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
your shoulders,

127
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
that even you

128
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
cannot feel

129
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
them upon your

130
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
backs, even

131
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
while you are in

132
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
bondage; and

133
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
this will I do

134
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
that ye may

135
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
stand as

136
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
witnesses for me

137
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
hereafter, and

138
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
that ye may know

139
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
of a surety

140
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
that I, the

141
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
Lord God, do

142
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,
visit my people in their afflictions.

143
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
15 And now it

144
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
came to pass

145
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
that the

146
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
burdens which

147
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
were laid upon

148
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
Alma and his

149
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
brethren were

150
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
made light;

151
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
yea, the Lord

152
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
did

153
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
strengthen them that

154
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
they could

155
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
bear up their

156
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
burdens with

157
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
ease, and they

158
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
did submit

159
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
cheerfully and

160
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
with

161
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,
patience to all the will of the Lord.

162
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
16 And it

163
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
came to pass

164
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
that so great

165
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
was their

166
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
faith and

167
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
their patience

168
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
that the

169
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
voice of the

170
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
Lord came unto

171
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
them again,

172
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
saying: Be

173
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
of good

174
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
comfort, for on

175
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
the morrow I

176
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
will

177
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,
deliver you out of bondage.

178
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
17 And he

179
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
said unto

180
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
Alma: Thou

181
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
shalt go

182
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
before this

183
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
people, and I

184
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
will go

185
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
with thee and

186
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
deliver

187
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
this people

188
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,
out of bondage.

189
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
18 Now it

190
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
came to

191
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
pass that

192
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
Alma and his

193
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
people in

194
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
the

195
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
night-time

196
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
gathered their

197
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
flocks

198
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
together,

199
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
and also of

200
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
their

201
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
grain; yea,

202
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
even all the

203
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0


204
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
night-time were

205
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
they

206
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,
gathering their flocks together.

207
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
19 And in

208
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
the

209
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
morning the

210
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
Lord

211
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
caused a deep

212
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
sleep to

213
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
come upon

214
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
the

215
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
Lamanites,

216
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
yea, and

217
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
all their

218
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0


219
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
task-masters were

220
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,
in a profound sleep.

221
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
20 And

222
00:18:42,0 --> 00:18:42,0
