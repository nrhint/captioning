00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
The Record of Zeniff—An account of his

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
people, from the time they left the land of

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Zarahemla until the time that they were delivered

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
out of the hands of the Lamanites. Comprising

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
chapters 9 through 22.Chapter 9 Zeniff leads a

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
group from Zarahemla to possess the land of

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Lehi-Nephi—The Lamanite king permits them to

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
inherit the land—There is war between the

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:16:10,
Lamanites and Zeniff’s people. About 200–187 B.C. 

10
00:16:10,0 --> 00:16:10,0
1 I, Zeniff, having been taught in all the

11
00:16:10,0 --> 00:16:10,0
language of the Nephites, and having had a

12
00:16:10,0 --> 00:16:10,0
knowledge of the land of Nephi, or of the land

13
00:16:10,0 --> 00:16:10,0
of our fathers’ first inheritance, and

14
00:16:10,0 --> 00:16:10,0
having been sent as a spy among the Lamanites

15
00:16:10,0 --> 00:16:10,0
that I might spy out their forces, that our

16
00:16:10,0 --> 00:16:10,0
army might come upon them and destroy them—but

17
00:16:10,0 --> 00:16:10,0
when I saw that which was good among them I

18
00:16:10,0 --> 00:19:20,
was desirous that they should not be destroyed.

19
00:19:20,0 --> 00:19:20,0
2 Therefore, I contended with my brethren

20
00:19:20,0 --> 00:19:20,0
in the wilderness, for I would that our

21
00:19:20,0 --> 00:19:20,0
ruler should make a treaty with them; but he

22
00:19:20,0 --> 00:19:20,0
being an austere and a blood-thirsty man

23
00:19:20,0 --> 00:19:20,0
commanded that I should be slain; but I

24
00:19:20,0 --> 00:19:20,0
was rescued by the shedding of much blood;

25
00:19:20,0 --> 00:19:20,0
for father fought against father, and

26
00:19:20,0 --> 00:19:20,0
brother against brother, until the greater

27
00:19:20,0 --> 00:19:20,0
number of our army was destroyed in the

28
00:19:20,0 --> 00:19:20,0
wilderness; and we returned, those of us that

29
00:19:20,0 --> 00:19:20,0
were spared, to the land of Zarahemla, to

30
00:19:20,0 --> 00:21:04,
relate that tale to their wives and their children.

31
00:21:04,0 --> 00:21:04,0
3 And yet, I being over-zealous to

32
00:21:04,0 --> 00:21:04,0
inherit the land of our fathers,

33
00:21:04,0 --> 00:21:04,0
collected as many as were desirous to go up to

34
00:21:04,0 --> 00:21:04,0
possess the land, and started again

35
00:21:04,0 --> 00:21:04,0
on our journey into the wilderness to

36
00:21:04,0 --> 00:21:04,0
go up to the land; but we were smitten

37
00:21:04,0 --> 00:21:04,0
with famine and sore afflictions; for

38
00:21:04,0 --> 00:20:36,
we were slow to remember the Lord our God.

39
00:20:36,0 --> 00:20:36,0
4 Nevertheless, after many days’

40
00:20:36,0 --> 00:20:36,0
wandering in the wilderness we

41
00:20:36,0 --> 00:20:36,0
pitched our tents in the place

42
00:20:36,0 --> 00:20:36,0
where our brethren were slain, which

43
00:20:36,0 --> 00:22:20,
was near to the land of our fathers.

44
00:22:20,0 --> 00:22:20,0
5 And it came to pass that I

45
00:22:20,0 --> 00:22:20,0
went again with four of my men into

46
00:22:20,0 --> 00:22:20,0
the city, in unto the king,

47
00:22:20,0 --> 00:22:20,0
that I might know of the

48
00:22:20,0 --> 00:22:20,0
disposition of the king, and that I might

49
00:22:20,0 --> 00:22:20,0
know if I might go in with my

50
00:22:20,0 --> 00:36:59,
people and possess the land in peace.

51
00:36:59,0 --> 00:36:59,0
6 And I went in unto the king,

52
00:36:59,0 --> 00:36:59,0
and he covenanted with me that

53
00:36:59,0 --> 00:36:59,0
I might possess the land of

54
00:36:59,0 --> 00:38:11,
Lehi-Nephi, and the land of Shilom.

55
00:38:11,0 --> 00:38:11,0
7 And he also commanded

56
00:38:11,0 --> 00:38:11,0
that his people should depart

57
00:38:11,0 --> 00:38:11,0
out of the land, and I and

58
00:38:11,0 --> 00:38:11,0
my people went into the

59
00:38:11,0 --> 00:37:57,
land that we might possess it.

60
00:37:57,0 --> 00:37:57,0
8 And we began to build

61
00:37:57,0 --> 00:37:57,0
buildings, and to

62
00:37:57,0 --> 00:37:57,0
repair the walls of the

63
00:37:57,0 --> 00:37:57,0
city, yea, even the walls

64
00:37:57,0 --> 00:37:57,0
of the city of

65
00:37:57,0 --> 00:39:41,
Lehi-Nephi, and the city of Shilom.

66
00:39:41,0 --> 00:39:41,0
9 And we began to till

67
00:39:41,0 --> 00:39:41,0
the ground, yea, even

68
00:39:41,0 --> 00:39:41,0
with all manner of

69
00:39:41,0 --> 00:39:41,0
seeds, with seeds of

70
00:39:41,0 --> 00:39:41,0
corn, and of wheat, and

71
00:39:41,0 --> 00:39:41,0
of barley, and with

72
00:39:41,0 --> 00:39:41,0
neas, and with sheum, and

73
00:39:41,0 --> 00:39:41,0
with seeds of all

74
00:39:41,0 --> 00:39:41,0
manner of fruits; and we

75
00:39:41,0 --> 00:39:41,0
did begin to multiply

76
00:39:41,0 --> 00:39:13,
and prosper in the land.

77
00:39:13,0 --> 00:39:13,0
10 Now it was the

78
00:39:13,0 --> 00:39:13,0
cunning and the

79
00:39:13,0 --> 00:39:13,0
craftiness of king Laman,

80
00:39:13,0 --> 00:39:13,0
to bring my people

81
00:39:13,0 --> 00:39:13,0
into bondage, that he

82
00:39:13,0 --> 00:39:13,0
yielded up the land

83
00:39:13,0 --> 00:38:45,
that we might possess it.

84
00:38:45,0 --> 00:38:45,0
11 Therefore it came

85
00:38:45,0 --> 00:38:45,0
to pass, that after

86
00:38:45,0 --> 00:38:45,0
we had dwelt in the

87
00:38:45,0 --> 00:38:45,0
land for the space

88
00:38:45,0 --> 00:38:45,0
of twelve years that

89
00:38:45,0 --> 00:38:45,0
king Laman began to

90
00:38:45,0 --> 00:38:45,0
grow uneasy, lest

91
00:38:45,0 --> 00:38:45,0
by any means my

92
00:38:45,0 --> 00:38:45,0
people should wax strong

93
00:38:45,0 --> 00:38:45,0
in the land, and

94
00:38:45,0 --> 00:38:45,0
that they could not

95
00:38:45,0 --> 00:38:45,0
overpower them and

96
00:38:45,0 --> 00:40:57,
bring them into bondage.

97
00:40:57,0 --> 00:40:57,0
12 Now they were a

98
00:40:57,0 --> 00:40:57,0
lazy and an

99
00:40:57,0 --> 00:40:57,0
idolatrous people;

100
00:40:57,0 --> 00:40:57,0
therefore they were

101
00:40:57,0 --> 00:40:57,0
desirous to bring us into

102
00:40:57,0 --> 00:40:57,0
bondage, that they

103
00:40:57,0 --> 00:40:57,0
might glut

104
00:40:57,0 --> 00:40:57,0
themselves with the labors

105
00:40:57,0 --> 00:40:57,0
of our hands; yea,

106
00:40:57,0 --> 00:40:57,0
that they might

107
00:40:57,0 --> 00:40:57,0
feast themselves upon

108
00:40:57,0 --> 01:04:23,
the flocks of our fields.

109
01:04:23,0 --> 01:04:23,0
13 Therefore it

110
01:04:23,0 --> 01:04:23,0
came to pass that

111
01:04:23,0 --> 01:04:23,0
king Laman began

112
01:04:23,0 --> 01:04:23,0
to stir up his

113
01:04:23,0 --> 01:04:23,0
people that they

114
01:04:23,0 --> 01:04:23,0
should contend with

115
01:04:23,0 --> 01:04:23,0
my people;

116
01:04:23,0 --> 01:04:23,0
therefore there began

117
01:04:23,0 --> 01:04:23,0
to be wars and

118
01:04:23,0 --> 01:03:55,
contentions in the land.

119
01:03:55,0 --> 01:03:55,0
14 For, in the

120
01:03:55,0 --> 01:03:55,0
thirteenth year

121
01:03:55,0 --> 01:03:55,0
of my reign in

122
01:03:55,0 --> 01:03:55,0
the land of Nephi,

123
01:03:55,0 --> 01:03:55,0
away on the

124
01:03:55,0 --> 01:03:55,0
south of the land

125
01:03:55,0 --> 01:03:55,0
of Shilom, when

126
01:03:55,0 --> 01:03:55,0
my people were

127
01:03:55,0 --> 01:03:55,0
watering and

128
01:03:55,0 --> 01:03:55,0
feeding their flocks,

129
01:03:55,0 --> 01:03:55,0
and tilling

130
01:03:55,0 --> 01:03:55,0
their lands, a

131
01:03:55,0 --> 01:03:55,0
numerous host of

132
01:03:55,0 --> 01:03:55,0
Lamanites came upon

133
01:03:55,0 --> 01:03:55,0
them and began

134
01:03:55,0 --> 01:03:55,0
to slay them,

135
01:03:55,0 --> 01:03:55,0
and to take off

136
01:03:55,0 --> 01:03:55,0
their flocks, and

137
01:03:55,0 --> 01:04:09,
the corn of their fields.

138
01:04:09,0 --> 01:04:09,0
15 Yea, and it

139
01:04:09,0 --> 01:04:09,0
came to pass

140
01:04:09,0 --> 01:04:09,0
that they fled,

141
01:04:09,0 --> 01:04:09,0
all that were

142
01:04:09,0 --> 01:04:09,0
not overtaken,

143
01:04:09,0 --> 01:04:09,0
even into the

144
01:04:09,0 --> 01:04:09,0
city of Nephi, and

145
01:04:09,0 --> 01:04:09,0
did call upon

146
01:04:09,0 --> 01:17:35,
me for protection.

147
01:17:35,0 --> 01:17:35,0
16 And it came

148
01:17:35,0 --> 01:17:35,0
to pass that I

149
01:17:35,0 --> 01:17:35,0
did arm them

150
01:17:35,0 --> 01:17:35,0
with bows, and

151
01:17:35,0 --> 01:17:35,0
with arrows, with

152
01:17:35,0 --> 01:17:35,0
swords, and

153
01:17:35,0 --> 01:17:35,0
with cimeters,

154
01:17:35,0 --> 01:17:35,0
and with clubs,

155
01:17:35,0 --> 01:17:35,0
and with slings,

156
01:17:35,0 --> 01:17:35,0
and with all

157
01:17:35,0 --> 01:17:35,0
manner of

158
01:17:35,0 --> 01:17:35,0
weapons which we

159
01:17:35,0 --> 01:17:35,0
could invent, and I

160
01:17:35,0 --> 01:17:35,0
and my people

161
01:17:35,0 --> 01:17:35,0
did go forth

162
01:17:35,0 --> 01:17:35,0
against the

163
01:17:35,0 --> 01:28:42,
Lamanites to battle.

164
01:28:42,0 --> 01:28:42,0
17 Yea, in the

165
01:28:42,0 --> 01:28:42,0
strength of

166
01:28:42,0 --> 01:28:42,0
the Lord did we

167
01:28:42,0 --> 01:28:42,0
go forth to

168
01:28:42,0 --> 01:28:42,0
battle against

169
01:28:42,0 --> 01:28:42,0
the Lamanites;

170
01:28:42,0 --> 01:28:42,0
for I and my

171
01:28:42,0 --> 01:28:42,0
people did cry

172
01:28:42,0 --> 01:28:42,0
mightily to

173
01:28:42,0 --> 01:28:42,0
the Lord that

174
01:28:42,0 --> 01:28:42,0
he would

175
01:28:42,0 --> 01:28:42,0
deliver us out of

176
01:28:42,0 --> 01:28:42,0
the hands of our

177
01:28:42,0 --> 01:28:42,0
enemies, for

178
01:28:42,0 --> 01:28:42,0
we were

179
01:28:42,0 --> 01:28:42,0
awakened to a

180
01:28:42,0 --> 01:28:42,0
remembrance of the

181
01:28:42,0 --> 01:33:39,
deliverance of our fathers.

182
01:33:39,0 --> 01:33:39,0
18 And God

183
01:33:39,0 --> 01:33:39,0
did hear our

184
01:33:39,0 --> 01:33:39,0
cries and did

185
01:33:39,0 --> 01:33:39,0
answer our

186
01:33:39,0 --> 01:33:39,0
prayers; and we

187
01:33:39,0 --> 01:33:39,0
did go forth

188
01:33:39,0 --> 01:33:39,0
in his might;

189
01:33:39,0 --> 01:33:39,0
yea, we did

190
01:33:39,0 --> 01:33:39,0
go forth

191
01:33:39,0 --> 01:33:39,0
against the

192
01:33:39,0 --> 01:33:39,0
Lamanites, and in

193
01:33:39,0 --> 01:33:39,0
one day and a

194
01:33:39,0 --> 01:33:39,0
night we did

195
01:33:39,0 --> 01:33:39,0
slay three

196
01:33:39,0 --> 01:33:39,0
thousand and

197
01:33:39,0 --> 01:33:39,0
forty-three;

198
01:33:39,0 --> 01:33:39,0
we did slay

199
01:33:39,0 --> 01:33:39,0
them even until

200
01:33:39,0 --> 01:33:39,0
we had

201
01:33:39,0 --> 01:37:10,
driven them out of our land.

202
01:37:10,0 --> 01:37:10,0
19 And I,

203
01:37:10,0 --> 01:37:10,0
myself, with

204
01:37:10,0 --> 01:37:10,0
mine own

205
01:37:10,0 --> 01:37:10,0
hands, did help

206
01:37:10,0 --> 01:37:10,0
to bury

207
01:37:10,0 --> 01:37:10,0
their dead. And

208
01:37:10,0 --> 01:37:10,0
behold, to

209
01:37:10,0 --> 01:37:10,0
our great

210
01:37:10,0 --> 01:37:10,0
sorrow and

211
01:37:10,0 --> 01:37:10,0
lamentation, two

212
01:37:10,0 --> 01:37:10,0
hundred and

213
01:37:10,0 --> 01:37:10,0


214
01:37:10,0 --> 01:37:10,0
seventy-nine of our

215
01:37:10,0 --> 01:41:38,
brethren were slain.
