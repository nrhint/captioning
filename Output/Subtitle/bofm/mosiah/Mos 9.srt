00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:03,556
The Record of Zeniff—An account of his

2
00:00:03,556 --> 00:00:07,112
people, from the time they left the land of

3
00:00:07,112 --> 00:00:10,668
Zarahemla until the time that they were delivered

4
00:00:10,668 --> 00:00:14,224
out of the hands of the Lamanites. Comprising

5
00:00:14,224 --> 00:00:17,78
chapters 9 through 22.Chapter 9 Zeniff leads a

6
00:00:17,78 --> 00:00:21,336
group from Zarahemla to possess the land of

7
00:00:21,336 --> 00:00:24,892
Lehi-Nephi—The Lamanite king permits them to

8
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:28,448
inherit the land—There is war between the

9
00:00:28,448 --> 00:00:32,366
Lamanites and Zeniff’s people. About 200–187 B.C. 

10
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:33,477
1 I, Zeniff, having been taught in all the

11
00:00:33,477 --> 00:00:34,588
language of the Nephites, and having had a

12
00:00:34,588 --> 00:00:35,699
knowledge of the land of Nephi, or of the land

13
00:00:35,699 --> 00:00:36,81
of our fathers’ first inheritance, and

14
00:00:36,81 --> 00:00:37,921
having been sent as a spy among the Lamanites

15
00:00:37,921 --> 00:00:39,032
that I might spy out their forces, that our

16
00:00:39,032 --> 00:00:40,143
army might come upon them and destroy them—but

17
00:00:40,143 --> 00:00:41,254
when I saw that which was good among them I

18
00:00:41,254 --> 00:00:42,709
was desirous that they should not be destroyed.

19
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:45,792
2 Therefore, I contended with my brethren

20
00:00:45,792 --> 00:00:48,875
in the wilderness, for I would that our

21
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:51,958
ruler should make a treaty with them; but he

22
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:55,041
being an austere and a blood-thirsty man

23
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:58,124
commanded that I should be slain; but I

24
00:00:58,124 --> 00:01:01,207
was rescued by the shedding of much blood;

25
00:01:01,207 --> 00:01:04,29
for father fought against father, and

26
00:01:04,29 --> 00:01:07,373
brother against brother, until the greater

27
00:01:07,373 --> 00:01:10,456
number of our army was destroyed in the

28
00:01:10,456 --> 00:01:13,539
wilderness; and we returned, those of us that

29
00:01:13,539 --> 00:01:16,622
were spared, to the land of Zarahemla, to

30
00:01:16,622 --> 00:01:19,012
relate that tale to their wives and their children.

31
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:18,887
3 And yet, I being over-zealous to

32
00:01:18,887 --> 00:01:18,762
inherit the land of our fathers,

33
00:01:18,762 --> 00:01:18,637
collected as many as were desirous to go up to

34
00:01:18,637 --> 00:01:18,512
possess the land, and started again

35
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:18,387
on our journey into the wilderness to

36
00:01:18,387 --> 00:01:18,262
go up to the land; but we were smitten

37
00:01:18,262 --> 00:01:18,137
with famine and sore afflictions; for

38
00:01:18,137 --> 00:01:18,078
we were slow to remember the Lord our God.

39
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:17,878
4 Nevertheless, after many days’

40
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:17,678
wandering in the wilderness we

41
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:17,478
pitched our tents in the place

42
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:17,278
where our brethren were slain, which

43
00:01:17,278 --> 00:01:17,144
was near to the land of our fathers.

44
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:17,43
5 And it came to pass that I

45
00:01:17,43 --> 00:01:17,716
went again with four of my men into

46
00:01:17,716 --> 00:01:18,002
the city, in unto the king,

47
00:01:18,002 --> 00:01:18,288
that I might know of the

48
00:01:18,288 --> 00:01:18,574
disposition of the king, and that I might

49
00:01:18,574 --> 00:01:18,86
know if I might go in with my

50
00:01:18,86 --> 00:01:19,546
people and possess the land in peace.

51
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:24,546
6 And I went in unto the king,

52
00:01:24,546 --> 00:01:29,546
and he covenanted with me that

53
00:01:29,546 --> 00:01:34,546
I might possess the land of

54
00:01:34,546 --> 00:01:39,866
Lehi-Nephi, and the land of Shilom.

55
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:41,266
7 And he also commanded

56
00:01:41,266 --> 00:01:42,666
that his people should depart

57
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:44,066
out of the land, and I and

58
00:01:44,066 --> 00:01:45,466
my people went into the

59
00:01:45,466 --> 00:01:46,873
land that we might possess it.

60
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:46,706
8 And we began to build

61
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:46,539
buildings, and to

62
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:46,372
repair the walls of the

63
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:46,205
city, yea, even the walls

64
00:01:46,205 --> 00:01:46,038
of the city of

65
00:01:46,038 --> 00:01:45,939
Lehi-Nephi, and the city of Shilom.

66
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:45,939
9 And we began to till

67
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:45,939
the ground, yea, even

68
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:45,939
with all manner of

69
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:45,939
seeds, with seeds of

70
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:45,939
corn, and of wheat, and

71
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:45,939
of barley, and with

72
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:45,939
neas, and with sheum, and

73
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:45,939
with seeds of all

74
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:45,939
manner of fruits; and we

75
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:45,939
did begin to multiply

76
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:45,005
and prosper in the land.

77
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:46,291
10 Now it was the

78
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:47,577
cunning and the

79
00:01:47,577 --> 00:01:48,863
craftiness of king Laman,

80
00:01:48,863 --> 00:01:50,149
to bring my people

81
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:51,435
into bondage, that he

82
00:01:51,435 --> 00:01:52,721
yielded up the land

83
00:01:52,721 --> 00:01:54,414
that we might possess it.

84
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:54,414
11 Therefore it came

85
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:54,414
to pass, that after

86
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:54,414
we had dwelt in the

87
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:54,414
land for the space

88
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:54,414
of twelve years that

89
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:54,414
king Laman began to

90
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:54,414
grow uneasy, lest

91
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:54,414
by any means my

92
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:54,414
people should wax strong

93
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:54,414
in the land, and

94
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:54,414
that they could not

95
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:54,414
overpower them and

96
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:54,881
bring them into bondage.

97
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,214
12 Now they were a

98
00:01:56,214 --> 00:01:57,547
lazy and an

99
00:01:57,547 --> 00:01:58,88
idolatrous people;

100
00:01:58,88 --> 00:02:00,213
therefore they were

101
00:02:00,213 --> 00:02:01,546
desirous to bring us into

102
00:02:01,546 --> 00:02:02,879
bondage, that they

103
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:04,212
might glut

104
00:02:04,212 --> 00:02:05,545
themselves with the labors

105
00:02:05,545 --> 00:02:06,878
of our hands; yea,

106
00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:08,211
that they might

107
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,544
feast themselves upon

108
00:02:09,544 --> 00:02:10,831
the flocks of our fields.

109
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:12,431
13 Therefore it

110
00:02:12,431 --> 00:02:14,031
came to pass that

111
00:02:14,031 --> 00:02:15,631
king Laman began

112
00:02:15,631 --> 00:02:17,231
to stir up his

113
00:02:17,231 --> 00:02:18,831
people that they

114
00:02:18,831 --> 00:02:20,431
should contend with

115
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,031
my people;

116
00:02:22,031 --> 00:02:23,631
therefore there began

117
00:02:23,631 --> 00:02:25,231
to be wars and

118
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:26,747
contentions in the land.

119
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:27,221
14 For, in the

120
00:02:27,221 --> 00:02:27,695
thirteenth year

121
00:02:27,695 --> 00:02:28,169
of my reign in

122
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:28,643
the land of Nephi,

123
00:02:28,643 --> 00:02:29,117
away on the

124
00:02:29,117 --> 00:02:29,591
south of the land

125
00:02:29,591 --> 00:02:30,065
of Shilom, when

126
00:02:30,065 --> 00:02:30,539
my people were

127
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:31,013
watering and

128
00:02:31,013 --> 00:02:31,487
feeding their flocks,

129
00:02:31,487 --> 00:02:31,961
and tilling

130
00:02:31,961 --> 00:02:32,435
their lands, a

131
00:02:32,435 --> 00:02:32,909
numerous host of

132
00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:33,383
Lamanites came upon

133
00:02:33,383 --> 00:02:33,857
them and began

134
00:02:33,857 --> 00:02:34,331
to slay them,

135
00:02:34,331 --> 00:02:34,805
and to take off

136
00:02:34,805 --> 00:02:35,279
their flocks, and

137
00:02:35,279 --> 00:02:35,155
the corn of their fields.

138
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:35,599
15 Yea, and it

139
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,043
came to pass

140
00:02:36,043 --> 00:02:36,487
that they fled,

141
00:02:36,487 --> 00:02:36,931
all that were

142
00:02:36,931 --> 00:02:37,375
not overtaken,

143
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:37,819
even into the

144
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:38,263
city of Nephi, and

145
00:02:38,263 --> 00:02:38,707
did call upon

146
00:02:38,707 --> 00:02:39,559
me for protection.

147
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:41,383
16 And it came

148
00:02:41,383 --> 00:02:43,207
to pass that I

149
00:02:43,207 --> 00:02:45,031
did arm them

150
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:46,855
with bows, and

151
00:02:46,855 --> 00:02:48,679
with arrows, with

152
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:50,503
swords, and

153
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,327
with cimeters,

154
00:02:52,327 --> 00:02:54,151
and with clubs,

155
00:02:54,151 --> 00:02:55,975
and with slings,

156
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:57,799
and with all

157
00:02:57,799 --> 00:02:59,623
manner of

158
00:02:59,623 --> 00:03:01,447
weapons which we

159
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:03,271
could invent, and I

160
00:03:03,271 --> 00:03:05,095
and my people

161
00:03:05,095 --> 00:03:06,919
did go forth

162
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,743
against the

163
00:03:08,743 --> 00:03:10,524
Lamanites to battle.

164
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,468
17 Yea, in the

165
00:03:12,468 --> 00:03:14,412
strength of

166
00:03:14,412 --> 00:03:16,356
the Lord did we

167
00:03:16,356 --> 00:03:18,3
go forth to

168
00:03:18,3 --> 00:03:20,244
battle against

169
00:03:20,244 --> 00:03:22,188
the Lamanites;

170
00:03:22,188 --> 00:03:24,132
for I and my

171
00:03:24,132 --> 00:03:26,076
people did cry

172
00:03:26,076 --> 00:03:28,02
mightily to

173
00:03:28,02 --> 00:03:29,964
the Lord that

174
00:03:29,964 --> 00:03:31,908
he would

175
00:03:31,908 --> 00:03:33,852
deliver us out of

176
00:03:33,852 --> 00:03:35,796
the hands of our

177
00:03:35,796 --> 00:03:37,74
enemies, for

178
00:03:37,74 --> 00:03:39,684
we were

179
00:03:39,684 --> 00:03:41,628
awakened to a

180
00:03:41,628 --> 00:03:43,572
remembrance of the

181
00:03:43,572 --> 00:03:45,392
deliverance of our fathers.

182
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:45,342
18 And God

183
00:03:45,342 --> 00:03:45,292
did hear our

184
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:45,242
cries and did

185
00:03:45,242 --> 00:03:45,192
answer our

186
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:45,142
prayers; and we

187
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:45,092
did go forth

188
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:45,042
in his might;

189
00:03:45,042 --> 00:03:44,992
yea, we did

190
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:44,942
go forth

191
00:03:44,942 --> 00:03:44,892
against the

192
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:44,842
Lamanites, and in

193
00:03:44,842 --> 00:03:44,792
one day and a

194
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:44,742
night we did

195
00:03:44,742 --> 00:03:44,692
slay three

196
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:44,642
thousand and

197
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:44,592
forty-three;

198
00:03:44,592 --> 00:03:44,542
we did slay

199
00:03:44,542 --> 00:03:44,492
them even until

200
00:03:44,492 --> 00:03:44,442
we had

201
00:03:44,442 --> 00:03:44,458
driven them out of our land.

202
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:44,744
19 And I,

203
00:03:44,744 --> 00:03:45,03
myself, with

204
00:03:45,03 --> 00:03:45,316
mine own

205
00:03:45,316 --> 00:03:45,602
hands, did help

206
00:03:45,602 --> 00:03:45,888
to bury

207
00:03:45,888 --> 00:03:46,174
their dead. And

208
00:03:46,174 --> 00:03:46,46
behold, to

209
00:03:46,46 --> 00:03:46,746
our great

210
00:03:46,746 --> 00:03:47,032
sorrow and

211
00:03:47,032 --> 00:03:47,318
lamentation, two

212
00:03:47,318 --> 00:03:47,604
hundred and

213
00:03:47,604 --> 00:03:47,89


214
00:03:47,89 --> 00:03:48,176
seventy-nine of our

215
00:03:48,176 --> 00:03:48,862
brethren were slain.
