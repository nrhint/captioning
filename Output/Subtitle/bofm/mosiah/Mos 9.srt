00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:09,111
The Record of Zeniff—An account of his people,

2
00:00:09,111 --> 00:00:18,222
 from the time they left the land of Zarahemla until

3
00:00:18,222 --> 00:00:27,333
 the time that they were delivered out of the hands

4
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:36,444
 of the Lamanites. Comprising chapters 9

5
00:00:36,444 --> 00:00:45,555
 through 22.Chapter 9 Zeniff leads a group from Zarahemla to

6
00:00:45,555 --> 00:00:54,666
 possess the land of Lehi-Nephi—The Lamanite king

7
00:00:54,666 --> 00:01:03,777
 permits them to inherit the land—There is war

8
00:01:03,777 --> 00:01:12,888
 between the Lamanites and Zeniff’s people. About

9
00:01:12,888 --> 00:01:21,999
 200–187 B.C.

10
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:27,938
1 I, Zeniff, having been taught in all the

11
00:01:27,938 --> 00:01:33,494
 language of the Nephites, and having had a knowledge of

12
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:39,05
 the land of Nephi, or of the land of our fathers’

13
00:01:39,05 --> 00:01:44,606
 first inheritance, and having been sent as a spy

14
00:01:44,606 --> 00:01:50,162
 among the Lamanites that I might spy out their

15
00:01:50,162 --> 00:01:55,718
 forces, that our army might come upon them and destroy

16
00:01:55,718 --> 00:02:01,274
 them—but when I saw that which was good among them

17
00:02:01,274 --> 00:02:06,83
 I was desirous that they should not be destroyed

18
00:02:06,83 --> 00:02:12,386


19
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:17,935
2 Therefore, I contended with my brethren in the

20
00:02:17,935 --> 00:02:23,571
 wilderness, for I would that our ruler should make

21
00:02:23,571 --> 00:02:29,207
 a treaty with them; but he being an austere and a

22
00:02:29,207 --> 00:02:34,843
 blood-thirsty man commanded that I should be

23
00:02:34,843 --> 00:02:40,479
 slain; but I was rescued by the shedding of much blood;

24
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:46,115
 for father fought against father, and brother

25
00:02:46,115 --> 00:02:51,751
 against brother, until the greater number of our army

26
00:02:51,751 --> 00:02:57,387
 was destroyed in the wilderness; and we returned,

27
00:02:57,387 --> 00:03:03,023
 those of us that were spared, to the land of

28
00:03:03,023 --> 00:03:08,659
 Zarahemla, to relate that tale to their wives and

29
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:14,295
 their children

30
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:21,904
3 And yet, I being over-zealous to inherit the

31
00:03:21,904 --> 00:03:29,047
 land of our fathers, collected as many as were

32
00:03:29,047 --> 00:03:36,19
 desirous to go up to possess the land, and started again

33
00:03:36,19 --> 00:03:43,333
 on our journey into the wilderness to go up to

34
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:50,476
 the land; but we were smitten with famine and sore

35
00:03:50,476 --> 00:03:57,619
 afflictions; for we were slow to remember the Lord

36
00:03:57,619 --> 00:04:04,762
 our God

37
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:10,478
4 Nevertheless, after many days’ wandering in the

38
00:04:10,478 --> 00:04:15,978
 wilderness we pitched our tents in the place where

39
00:04:15,978 --> 00:04:21,478
 our brethren were slain, which was near to the

40
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:26,978
 land of our fathers

41
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:32,533
5 And it came to pass that I went again with four

42
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:38,533
 of my men into the city, in unto the king, that I

43
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:44,533
 might know of the disposition of the king, and

44
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:50,533
 that I might know if I might go in with my people and

45
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:56,533
 possess the land in peace

46
00:04:56,062 --> 00:05:01,729
6 And I went in unto the king, and he covenanted

47
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:07,396
 with me that I might possess the land of

48
00:05:07,396 --> 00:05:13,063
 Lehi-Nephi, and the land of Shilom

49
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:19,346
7 And he also commanded that his people should

50
00:05:19,346 --> 00:05:25,679
 depart out of the land, and I and my people went into

51
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:32,012
 the land that we might possess it

52
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:41,633
8 And we began to build buildings, and to repair

53
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:50,3
 the walls of the city, yea, even the walls of the

54
00:05:50,3 --> 00:05:58,967
 city of Lehi-Nephi, and the city of Shilom

55
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:06,125
9 And we began to till the ground, yea, even with

56
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:13,325
 all manner of seeds, with seeds of corn, and of

57
00:06:13,325 --> 00:06:20,525
 wheat, and of barley, and with neas, and with sheum,

58
00:06:20,525 --> 00:06:27,725
 and with seeds of all manner of fruits; and we

59
00:06:27,725 --> 00:06:34,925
 did begin to multiply and prosper in the land

60
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:42,161
10 Now it was the cunning and the craftiness of

61
00:06:42,161 --> 00:06:49,494
 king Laman, to bring my people into bondage, that he

62
00:06:49,494 --> 00:06:56,827
 yielded up the land that we might possess it

63
00:06:56,65 --> 00:07:01,483
11 Therefore it came to pass, that after we had

64
00:07:01,483 --> 00:07:06,316
 dwelt in the land for the space of twelve years that

65
00:07:06,316 --> 00:07:11,149
 king Laman began to grow uneasy, lest by any

66
00:07:11,149 --> 00:07:15,982
 means my people should wax strong in the land, and

67
00:07:15,982 --> 00:07:20,815
 that they could not overpower them and bring them

68
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:25,648
 into bondage

69
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:32,245
12 Now they were a lazy and an idolatrous people;

70
00:07:32,245 --> 00:07:38,845
 therefore they were desirous to bring us into

71
00:07:38,845 --> 00:07:45,445
 bondage, that they might glut themselves with the

72
00:07:45,445 --> 00:07:52,045
 labors of our hands; yea, that they might feast

73
00:07:52,045 --> 00:07:58,645
 themselves upon the flocks of our fields

74
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:04,195
13 Therefore it came to pass that king Laman began

75
00:08:04,195 --> 00:08:09,445
 to stir up his people that they should contend

76
00:08:09,445 --> 00:08:14,695
 with my people; therefore there began to be wars and

77
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:19,945
 contentions in the land

78
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:25,447
14 For, in the thirteenth year of my reign in the

79
00:08:25,447 --> 00:08:31,161
 land of Nephi, away on the south of the land of

80
00:08:31,161 --> 00:08:36,875
 Shilom, when my people were watering and feeding

81
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:42,589
 their flocks, and tilling their lands, a numerous

82
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:48,303
 host of Lamanites came upon them and began to slay

83
00:08:48,303 --> 00:08:54,017
 them, and to take off their flocks, and the corn of

84
00:08:54,017 --> 00:08:59,731
 their fields

85
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:02,273
15 Yea, and it came to pass that they fled, all

86
00:09:02,273 --> 00:09:04,94
 that were not overtaken, even into the city of

87
00:09:04,94 --> 00:09:07,607
 Nephi, and did call upon me for protection

88
00:09:07,58 --> 00:09:15,747
16 And it came to pass that I did arm them with

89
00:09:15,747 --> 00:09:23,914
 bows, and with arrows, with swords, and with

90
00:09:23,914 --> 00:09:32,081
 cimeters, and with clubs, and with slings, and with all

91
00:09:32,081 --> 00:09:40,248
 manner of weapons which we could invent, and I and

92
00:09:40,248 --> 00:09:48,415
 my people did go forth against the Lamanites to

93
00:09:48,415 --> 00:09:56,582
 battle

94
00:09:56,396 --> 00:10:02,063
17 Yea, in the strength of the Lord did we go

95
00:10:02,063 --> 00:10:07,73
 forth to battle against the Lamanites; for I and my

96
00:10:07,73 --> 00:10:13,397
 people did cry mightily to the Lord that he would

97
00:10:13,397 --> 00:10:19,064
 deliver us out of the hands of our enemies, for we

98
00:10:19,064 --> 00:10:24,731
 were awakened to a remembrance of the deliverance

99
00:10:24,731 --> 00:10:30,398
 of our fathers

100
00:10:30,33 --> 00:10:36,497
18 And God did hear our cries and did answer our

101
00:10:36,497 --> 00:10:42,664
 prayers; and we did go forth in his might; yea, we

102
00:10:42,664 --> 00:10:48,831
 did go forth against the Lamanites, and in one day

103
00:10:48,831 --> 00:10:54,998
 and a night we did slay three thousand and

104
00:10:54,998 --> 00:11:01,165
 forty-three; we did slay them even until we had driven

105
00:11:01,165 --> 00:11:07,332
 them out of our land

106
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:10,566
19 And I, myself, with mine own hands, did help to

107
00:11:10,566 --> 00:11:14,066
 bury their dead. And behold, to our great sorrow

108
00:11:14,066 --> 00:11:17,566
 and lamentation, two hundred and seventy-nine of

109
00:11:17,566 --> 00:11:21,066
 our brethren were slain.
