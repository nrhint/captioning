1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:08,25
Chapter 17 Alma believes and writes the

2
00:00:08,25 --> 00:00:16,5
words of Abinadiâ€”Abinadi suffers death

3
00:00:16,5 --> 00:00:24,75
by fireâ€”He prophesies disease and death

4
00:00:24,75 --> 00:00:33,834
by fire upon his murderers. About 148Â B.C. 

5
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:34,234
1 And now it came to pass that

6
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:34,634
when Abinadi had finished these

7
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:35,034
sayings, that the king commanded that

8
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:35,434
the priests should take him and

9
00:00:35,434 --> 00:00:35,769
cause that he should be put to death.

10
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:36,133
2 But there was one among them

11
00:00:36,133 --> 00:00:36,497
whose name was Alma, he also being

12
00:00:36,497 --> 00:00:36,861
a descendant of Nephi. And he was

13
00:00:36,861 --> 00:00:37,225
a young man, and he believed the

14
00:00:37,225 --> 00:00:37,589
words which Abinadi had spoken,

15
00:00:37,589 --> 00:00:37,953
for he knew concerning the

16
00:00:37,953 --> 00:00:38,317
iniquity which Abinadi had testified

17
00:00:38,317 --> 00:00:38,681
against them; therefore he began to

18
00:00:38,681 --> 00:00:39,045
plead with the king that he

19
00:00:39,045 --> 00:00:39,409
would not be angry with Abinadi, but

20
00:00:39,409 --> 00:00:39,239
suffer that he might depart in peace.

21
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:39,039
3 But the king was more

22
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:38,839
wroth, and caused that Alma should

23
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:38,639
be cast out from among them,

24
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:38,439
and sent his servants after

25
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:38,305
him that they might slay him.

26
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:38,638
4 But he fled from before

27
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:38,971
them and hid himself that

28
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:39,304
they found him not. And he

29
00:00:39,304 --> 00:00:39,637
being concealed for many

30
00:00:39,637 --> 00:00:39,97
days did write all the

31
00:00:39,97 --> 00:00:40,24
words which Abinadi had spoken.

32
00:00:40,24 --> 00:00:40,073
5 And it came to pass

33
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:39,906
that the king caused

34
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:39,739
that his guards should

35
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:39,572
surround Abinadi and take

36
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:39,405
him; and they bound him

37
00:00:39,405 --> 00:00:39,306
and cast him into prison.

38
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:39,106
6 And after three

39
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:38,906
days, having counseled

40
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:38,706
with his priests, he

41
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:38,506
caused that he should

42
00:00:38,506 --> 00:00:38,372
again be brought before him.

43
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:38,172
7 And he said unto

44
00:00:38,172 --> 00:00:37,972
him: Abinadi, we have

45
00:00:37,972 --> 00:00:37,772
found an accusation

46
00:00:37,772 --> 00:00:37,572
against thee, and

47
00:00:37,572 --> 00:00:37,437
thou art worthy of death.

48
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:37,354
8 For thou hast

49
00:00:37,354 --> 00:00:37,271
said that God

50
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:37,188
himself should come down

51
00:00:37,188 --> 00:00:37,105
among the

52
00:00:37,105 --> 00:00:37,022
children of men; and now,

53
00:00:37,022 --> 00:00:36,939
for this cause

54
00:00:36,939 --> 00:00:36,856
thou shalt be put to

55
00:00:36,856 --> 00:00:36,773
death unless thou

56
00:00:36,773 --> 00:00:36,69
wilt recall all

57
00:00:36,69 --> 00:00:36,607
the words which

58
00:00:36,607 --> 00:00:36,524
thou hast spoken evil

59
00:00:36,524 --> 00:00:36,503
concerning me and my people.

60
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:36,789
9 Now Abinadi

61
00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:37,075
said unto him: I say

62
00:00:37,075 --> 00:00:37,361
unto you, I will

63
00:00:37,361 --> 00:00:37,647
not recall the

64
00:00:37,647 --> 00:00:37,933
words which I have

65
00:00:37,933 --> 00:00:38,219
spoken unto you

66
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:38,505
concerning this

67
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:38,791
people, for they

68
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:39,077
are true; and that

69
00:00:39,077 --> 00:00:39,363
ye may know of

70
00:00:39,363 --> 00:00:39,649
their surety I

71
00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:39,935
have suffered myself

72
00:00:39,935 --> 00:00:40,221
that I have

73
00:00:40,221 --> 00:00:40,908
fallen into your hands.

74
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:41,375
10 Yea, and I

75
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:41,842
will suffer even

76
00:00:41,842 --> 00:00:42,309
until death, and

77
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:42,776
I will not

78
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:43,243
recall my words, and

79
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:43,71
they shall stand

80
00:00:43,71 --> 00:00:44,177
as a testimony

81
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:44,644
against you. And

82
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:45,111
if ye slay me

83
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:45,578
ye will shed

84
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:46,045
innocent blood, and

85
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:46,512
this shall also

86
00:00:46,512 --> 00:00:46,979
stand as a

87
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:47,446
testimony against you

88
00:00:47,446 --> 00:00:47,948
at the last day.

89
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:48,281
11 And now

90
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:48,614
king Noah was

91
00:00:48,614 --> 00:00:48,947
about to release

92
00:00:48,947 --> 00:00:49,28
him, for he

93
00:00:49,28 --> 00:00:49,613
feared his word;

94
00:00:49,613 --> 00:00:49,946
for he feared

95
00:00:49,946 --> 00:00:50,279
that the

96
00:00:50,279 --> 00:00:50,612
judgments of God

97
00:00:50,612 --> 00:00:50,951
would come upon him.

98
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:51,389
12 But the

99
00:00:51,389 --> 00:00:51,827
priests lifted

100
00:00:51,827 --> 00:00:52,265
up their

101
00:00:52,265 --> 00:00:52,703
voices against

102
00:00:52,703 --> 00:00:53,141
him, and began

103
00:00:53,141 --> 00:00:53,579
to accuse

104
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:54,017
him, saying: He

105
00:00:54,017 --> 00:00:54,455
has reviled

106
00:00:54,455 --> 00:00:54,893
the king.

107
00:00:54,893 --> 00:00:55,331
Therefore the

108
00:00:55,331 --> 00:00:55,769
king was stirred

109
00:00:55,769 --> 00:00:56,207
up in anger

110
00:00:56,207 --> 00:00:56,645
against him,

111
00:00:56,645 --> 00:00:57,083
and he

112
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:57,521
delivered him up

113
00:00:57,521 --> 00:00:57,991
that he might be slain.

114
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
13 And it

115
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
came to pass

116
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
that they

117
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
took him and

118
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
bound him, and

119
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
scourged

120
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
his skin with

121
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
faggots,

122
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
yea, even unto death.

123
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
14 And now

124
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
when the

125
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
flames

126
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
began to

127
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
scorch him, he

128
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
cried

129
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
unto them, saying:

130
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
15

131
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
Behold, even as

132
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
ye have

133
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
done unto

134
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
me, so

135
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
shall it

136
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
come to

137
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
pass that

138
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
thy seed

139
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
shall

140
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
cause that

141
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
many shall

142
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
suffer

143
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
the pains

144
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
that I do

145
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
suffer,

146
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
even the

147
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
pains of

148
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
death by

149
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
fire; and

150
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
this

151
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
because they

152
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
believe

153
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
in the

154
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
salvation of the Lord their God.

155
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
16 And

156
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
it will

157
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
come to

158
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
pass that

159
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
ye

160
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
shall be

161
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
afflicted

162
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
with all

163
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
manner

164
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
of

165
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
diseases

166
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
because of

167
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
your iniquities.

168
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
17 Yea,

169
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
and ye

170
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
shall

171
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
be

172
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
smitten on

173
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
every

174
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
hand,

175
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
and shall

176
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
be

177
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
driven and

178
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991


179
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
scattered to

180
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
and

181
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
fro, even

182
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
as a

183
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
wild

184
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
flock is

185
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
driven by

186
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
wild

187
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
and ferocious beasts.

188
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
18 And

189
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
in

190
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
that day

191
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
ye

192
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
shall be

193
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991


194
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
hunted, and

195
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
ye

196
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
shall be

197
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
taken

198
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
by

199
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
the hand

200
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
of

201
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
your

202
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
enemies,

203
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
and

204
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:57,991
