00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 17 Alma believes and writes the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
words of Abinadi—Abinadi suffers death

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
by fire—He prophesies disease and death

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:05:43,
by fire upon his murderers. About 148 B.C. 

5
00:05:43,0 --> 00:05:43,0
1 And now it came to pass that

6
00:05:43,0 --> 00:05:43,0
when Abinadi had finished these

7
00:05:43,0 --> 00:05:43,0
sayings, that the king commanded that

8
00:05:43,0 --> 00:05:43,0
the priests should take him and

9
00:05:43,0 --> 00:20:35,
cause that he should be put to death.

10
00:20:35,0 --> 00:20:35,0
2 But there was one among them

11
00:20:35,0 --> 00:20:35,0
whose name was Alma, he also being

12
00:20:35,0 --> 00:20:35,0
a descendant of Nephi. And he was

13
00:20:35,0 --> 00:20:35,0
a young man, and he believed the

14
00:20:35,0 --> 00:20:35,0
words which Abinadi had spoken,

15
00:20:35,0 --> 00:20:35,0
for he knew concerning the

16
00:20:35,0 --> 00:20:35,0
iniquity which Abinadi had testified

17
00:20:35,0 --> 00:20:35,0
against them; therefore he began to

18
00:20:35,0 --> 00:20:35,0
plead with the king that he

19
00:20:35,0 --> 00:20:35,0
would not be angry with Abinadi, but

20
00:20:35,0 --> 00:30:45,
suffer that he might depart in peace.

21
00:30:45,0 --> 00:30:45,0
3 But the king was more

22
00:30:45,0 --> 00:30:45,0
wroth, and caused that Alma should

23
00:30:45,0 --> 00:30:45,0
be cast out from among them,

24
00:30:45,0 --> 00:30:45,0
and sent his servants after

25
00:30:45,0 --> 00:30:17,
him that they might slay him.

26
00:30:17,0 --> 00:30:17,0
4 But he fled from before

27
00:30:17,0 --> 00:30:17,0
them and hid himself that

28
00:30:17,0 --> 00:30:17,0
they found him not. And he

29
00:30:17,0 --> 00:30:17,0
being concealed for many

30
00:30:17,0 --> 00:30:17,0
days did write all the

31
00:30:17,0 --> 00:29:49,
words which Abinadi had spoken.

32
00:29:49,0 --> 00:29:49,0
5 And it came to pass

33
00:29:49,0 --> 00:29:49,0
that the king caused

34
00:29:49,0 --> 00:29:49,0
that his guards should

35
00:29:49,0 --> 00:29:49,0
surround Abinadi and take

36
00:29:49,0 --> 00:29:49,0
him; and they bound him

37
00:29:49,0 --> 00:37:46,
and cast him into prison.

38
00:37:46,0 --> 00:37:46,0
6 And after three

39
00:37:46,0 --> 00:37:46,0
days, having counseled

40
00:37:46,0 --> 00:37:46,0
with his priests, he

41
00:37:46,0 --> 00:37:46,0
caused that he should

42
00:37:46,0 --> 00:41:30,
again be brought before him.

43
00:41:30,0 --> 00:41:30,0
7 And he said unto

44
00:41:30,0 --> 00:41:30,0
him: Abinadi, we have

45
00:41:30,0 --> 00:41:30,0
found an accusation

46
00:41:30,0 --> 00:41:30,0
against thee, and

47
00:41:30,0 --> 00:41:02,
thou art worthy of death.

48
00:41:02,0 --> 00:41:02,0
8 For thou hast

49
00:41:02,0 --> 00:41:02,0
said that God

50
00:41:02,0 --> 00:41:02,0
himself should come down

51
00:41:02,0 --> 00:41:02,0
among the

52
00:41:02,0 --> 00:41:02,0
children of men; and now,

53
00:41:02,0 --> 00:41:02,0
for this cause

54
00:41:02,0 --> 00:41:02,0
thou shalt be put to

55
00:41:02,0 --> 00:41:02,0
death unless thou

56
00:41:02,0 --> 00:41:02,0
wilt recall all

57
00:41:02,0 --> 00:41:02,0
the words which

58
00:41:02,0 --> 00:41:02,0
thou hast spoken evil

59
00:41:02,0 --> 00:40:48,
concerning me and my people.

60
00:40:48,0 --> 00:40:48,0
9 Now Abinadi

61
00:40:48,0 --> 00:40:48,0
said unto him: I say

62
00:40:48,0 --> 00:40:48,0
unto you, I will

63
00:40:48,0 --> 00:40:48,0
not recall the

64
00:40:48,0 --> 00:40:48,0
words which I have

65
00:40:48,0 --> 00:40:48,0
spoken unto you

66
00:40:48,0 --> 00:40:48,0
concerning this

67
00:40:48,0 --> 00:40:48,0
people, for they

68
00:40:48,0 --> 00:40:48,0
are true; and that

69
00:40:48,0 --> 00:40:48,0
ye may know of

70
00:40:48,0 --> 00:40:48,0
their surety I

71
00:40:48,0 --> 00:40:48,0
have suffered myself

72
00:40:48,0 --> 00:40:48,0
that I have

73
00:40:48,0 --> 00:40:20,
fallen into your hands.

74
00:40:20,0 --> 00:40:20,0
10 Yea, and I

75
00:40:20,0 --> 00:40:20,0
will suffer even

76
00:40:20,0 --> 00:40:20,0
until death, and

77
00:40:20,0 --> 00:40:20,0
I will not

78
00:40:20,0 --> 00:40:20,0
recall my words, and

79
00:40:20,0 --> 00:40:20,0
they shall stand

80
00:40:20,0 --> 00:40:20,0
as a testimony

81
00:40:20,0 --> 00:40:20,0
against you. And

82
00:40:20,0 --> 00:40:20,0
if ye slay me

83
00:40:20,0 --> 00:40:20,0
ye will shed

84
00:40:20,0 --> 00:40:20,0
innocent blood, and

85
00:40:20,0 --> 00:40:20,0
this shall also

86
00:40:20,0 --> 00:40:20,0
stand as a

87
00:40:20,0 --> 00:40:20,0
testimony against you

88
00:40:20,0 --> 00:42:48,
at the last day.

89
00:42:48,0 --> 00:42:48,0
11 And now

90
00:42:48,0 --> 00:42:48,0
king Noah was

91
00:42:48,0 --> 00:42:48,0
about to release

92
00:42:48,0 --> 00:42:48,0
him, for he

93
00:42:48,0 --> 00:42:48,0
feared his word;

94
00:42:48,0 --> 00:42:48,0
for he feared

95
00:42:48,0 --> 00:42:48,0
that the

96
00:42:48,0 --> 00:42:48,0
judgments of God

97
00:42:48,0 --> 00:46:47,
would come upon him.

98
00:46:47,0 --> 00:46:47,0
12 But the

99
00:46:47,0 --> 00:46:47,0
priests lifted

100
00:46:47,0 --> 00:46:47,0
up their

101
00:46:47,0 --> 00:46:47,0
voices against

102
00:46:47,0 --> 00:46:47,0
him, and began

103
00:46:47,0 --> 00:46:47,0
to accuse

104
00:46:47,0 --> 00:46:47,0
him, saying: He

105
00:46:47,0 --> 00:46:47,0
has reviled

106
00:46:47,0 --> 00:46:47,0
the king.

107
00:46:47,0 --> 00:46:47,0
Therefore the

108
00:46:47,0 --> 00:46:47,0
king was stirred

109
00:46:47,0 --> 00:46:47,0
up in anger

110
00:46:47,0 --> 00:46:47,0
against him,

111
00:46:47,0 --> 00:46:47,0
and he

112
00:46:47,0 --> 00:46:47,0
delivered him up

113
00:46:47,0 --> 00:51:58,
that he might be slain.

114
00:51:58,0 --> 00:51:58,0
13 And it

115
00:51:58,0 --> 00:51:58,0
came to pass

116
00:51:58,0 --> 00:51:58,0
that they

117
00:51:58,0 --> 00:51:58,0
took him and

118
00:51:58,0 --> 00:51:58,0
bound him, and

119
00:51:58,0 --> 00:51:58,0
scourged

120
00:51:58,0 --> 00:51:58,0
his skin with

121
00:51:58,0 --> 00:51:58,0
faggots,

122
00:51:58,0 --> 01:00:53,
yea, even unto death.

123
01:00:53,0 --> 01:00:53,0
14 And now

124
01:00:53,0 --> 01:00:53,0
when the

125
01:00:53,0 --> 01:00:53,0
flames

126
01:00:53,0 --> 01:00:53,0
began to

127
01:00:53,0 --> 01:00:53,0
scorch him, he

128
01:00:53,0 --> 01:00:53,0
cried

129
01:00:53,0 --> 01:10:02,
unto them, saying:

130
01:10:02,0 --> 01:10:02,0
15

131
01:10:02,0 --> 01:10:02,0
Behold, even as

132
01:10:02,0 --> 01:10:02,0
ye have

133
01:10:02,0 --> 01:10:02,0
done unto

134
01:10:02,0 --> 01:10:02,0
me, so

135
01:10:02,0 --> 01:10:02,0
shall it

136
01:10:02,0 --> 01:10:02,0
come to

137
01:10:02,0 --> 01:10:02,0
pass that

138
01:10:02,0 --> 01:10:02,0
thy seed

139
01:10:02,0 --> 01:10:02,0
shall

140
01:10:02,0 --> 01:10:02,0
cause that

141
01:10:02,0 --> 01:10:02,0
many shall

142
01:10:02,0 --> 01:10:02,0
suffer

143
01:10:02,0 --> 01:10:02,0
the pains

144
01:10:02,0 --> 01:10:02,0
that I do

145
01:10:02,0 --> 01:10:02,0
suffer,

146
01:10:02,0 --> 01:10:02,0
even the

147
01:10:02,0 --> 01:10:02,0
pains of

148
01:10:02,0 --> 01:10:02,0
death by

149
01:10:02,0 --> 01:10:02,0
fire; and

150
01:10:02,0 --> 01:10:02,0
this

151
01:10:02,0 --> 01:10:02,0
because they

152
01:10:02,0 --> 01:10:02,0
believe

153
01:10:02,0 --> 01:10:02,0
in the

154
01:10:02,0 --> 01:13:33,
salvation of the Lord their God.

155
01:13:33,0 --> 01:13:33,0
16 And

156
01:13:33,0 --> 01:13:33,0
it will

157
01:13:33,0 --> 01:13:33,0
come to

158
01:13:33,0 --> 01:13:33,0
pass that

159
01:13:33,0 --> 01:13:33,0
ye

160
01:13:33,0 --> 01:13:33,0
shall be

161
01:13:33,0 --> 01:13:33,0
afflicted

162
01:13:33,0 --> 01:13:33,0
with all

163
01:13:33,0 --> 01:13:33,0
manner

164
01:13:33,0 --> 01:13:33,0
of

165
01:13:33,0 --> 01:13:33,0
diseases

166
01:13:33,0 --> 01:13:33,0
because of

167
01:13:33,0 --> 01:15:17,
your iniquities.

168
01:15:17,0 --> 01:15:17,0
17 Yea,

169
01:15:17,0 --> 01:15:17,0
and ye

170
01:15:17,0 --> 01:15:17,0
shall

171
01:15:17,0 --> 01:15:17,0
be

172
01:15:17,0 --> 01:15:17,0
smitten on

173
01:15:17,0 --> 01:15:17,0
every

174
01:15:17,0 --> 01:15:17,0
hand,

175
01:15:17,0 --> 01:15:17,0
and shall

176
01:15:17,0 --> 01:15:17,0
be

177
01:15:17,0 --> 01:15:17,0
driven and

178
01:15:17,0 --> 01:15:17,0


179
01:15:17,0 --> 01:15:17,0
scattered to

180
01:15:17,0 --> 01:15:17,0
and

181
01:15:17,0 --> 01:15:17,0
fro, even

182
01:15:17,0 --> 01:15:17,0
as a

183
01:15:17,0 --> 01:15:17,0
wild

184
01:15:17,0 --> 01:15:17,0
flock is

185
01:15:17,0 --> 01:15:17,0
driven by

186
01:15:17,0 --> 01:15:17,0
wild

187
01:15:17,0 --> 01:17:01,
and ferocious beasts.

188
01:17:01,0 --> 01:17:01,0
18 And

189
01:17:01,0 --> 01:17:01,0
in

190
01:17:01,0 --> 01:17:01,0
that day

191
01:17:01,0 --> 01:17:01,0
ye

192
01:17:01,0 --> 01:17:01,0
shall be

193
01:17:01,0 --> 01:17:01,0


194
01:17:01,0 --> 01:17:01,0
hunted, and

195
01:17:01,0 --> 01:17:01,0
ye

196
01:17:01,0 --> 01:17:01,0
shall be

197
01:17:01,0 --> 01:17:01,0
taken

198
01:17:01,0 --> 01:17:01,0
by

199
01:17:01,0 --> 01:17:01,0
the hand

200
01:17:01,0 --> 01:17:01,0
of

201
01:17:01,0 --> 01:17:01,0
your

202
01:17:01,0 --> 01:17:01,0
enemies,

203
01:17:01,0 --> 01:17:01,0
and

204
01:17:01,0 --> 01:17:01,0
then ye

205
01:17:01,0 --> 01:17:01,0
shall

206
01:17:01,0 --> 01:17:01,0


207
01:17:01,0 --> 01:17:01,0
suffer, as I

208
01:17:01,0 --> 01:17:01,0


209
01:17:01,0 --> 01:17:01,0
suffer, the

210
01:17:01,0 --> 01:20:32,
pains of death by fire.

211
01:20:32,0 --> 01:20:32,0
19

212
01:20:32,0 --> 01:20:32,0
Thus

213
01:20:32,0 --> 01:20:32,0
God

214
01:20:32,0 --> 01:20:32,0


215
01:20:32,0 --> 01:20:32,0
executeth

216
01:20:32,0 --> 01:20:32,0


217
01:20:32,0 --> 01:20:32,0
vengeance

218
01:20:32,0 --> 01:20:32,0
upon

219
01:20:32,0 --> 01:20:32,0
those

220
01:20:32,0 --> 01:20:32,0
that

221
01:20:32,0 --> 01:20:32,0
destroy

222
01:20:32,0 --> 01:20:32,0
his

223
01:20:32,0 --> 01:20:32,0


224
01:20:32,0 --> 01:20:32,0
people. O

225
01:20:32,0 --> 01:20:32,0
God,

226
01:20:32,0 --> 01:25:29,
receive my soul.

227
01:25:29,0 --> 01:25:29,0
20

228
