1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,75
Chapter 17 Alma believes and writes the words of

2
00:00:01,75 --> 00:00:03,5
 Abinadi—Abinadi suffers death by fire—He prophesies

3
00:00:03,5 --> 00:00:05,25
 disease and death by fire upon his murderers.

4
00:00:05,25 --> 00:00:07,0
 About 148 B.C.

5
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,975
1 And now it came to pass that when Abinadi had

6
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:11,975
 finished these sayings, that the king commanded that

7
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:13,975
 the priests should take him and cause that he

8
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:15,975
 should be put to death

9
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:16,949
2 But there was one among them whose name was

10
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:17,949
 Alma, he also being a descendant of Nephi. And he was

11
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:18,949
 a young man, and he believed the words which

12
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:19,949
 Abinadi had spoken, for he knew concerning the iniquity

13
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:20,949
 which Abinadi had testified against them;

14
00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:21,949
 therefore he began to plead with the king that he would

15
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:22,949
 not be angry with Abinadi, but suffer that he might

16
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:23,949
 depart in peace

17
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:26,591
3 But the king was more wroth, and caused that

18
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:29,258
 Alma should be cast out from among them, and sent his

19
00:00:29,258 --> 00:00:31,925
 servants after him that they might slay him

20
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,899
4 But he fled from before them and hid himself

21
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,899
 that they found him not. And he being concealed for

22
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:37,899
 many days did write all the words which Abinadi had

23
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:39,899
 spoken

24
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,54
5 And it came to pass that the king caused that

25
00:00:42,54 --> 00:00:45,207
 his guards should surround Abinadi and take him; and

26
00:00:45,207 --> 00:00:47,874
 they bound him and cast him into prison

27
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:50,515
6 And after three days, having counseled with his

28
00:00:50,515 --> 00:00:53,182
 priests, he caused that he should again be brought

29
00:00:53,182 --> 00:00:55,849
 before him

30
00:00:55,822 --> 00:01:01,155
7 And he said unto him: Abinadi, we have found an

31
00:01:01,155 --> 00:01:06,488
 accusation against thee, and thou art worthy of

32
00:01:06,488 --> 00:01:11,821
 death

33
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:14,972
8 For thou hast said that God himself should come

34
00:01:14,972 --> 00:01:18,172
 down among the children of men; and now, for this

35
00:01:18,172 --> 00:01:21,372
 cause thou shalt be put to death unless thou wilt

36
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:24,572
 recall all the words which thou hast spoken evil

37
00:01:24,572 --> 00:01:27,772
 concerning me and my people

38
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:30,921
9 Now Abinadi said unto him: I say unto you, I

39
00:01:30,921 --> 00:01:34,121
 will not recall the words which I have spoken unto

40
00:01:34,121 --> 00:01:37,321
 you concerning this people, for they are true; and

41
00:01:37,321 --> 00:01:40,521
 that ye may know of their surety I have suffered

42
00:01:40,521 --> 00:01:43,721
 myself that I have fallen into your hands

43
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:45,27
10 Yea, and I will suffer even until death, and I

44
00:01:45,27 --> 00:01:46,87
 will not recall my words, and they shall stand as

45
00:01:46,87 --> 00:01:48,47
 a testimony against you. And if ye slay me ye will

46
00:01:48,47 --> 00:01:50,07
 shed innocent blood, and this shall also stand as

47
00:01:50,07 --> 00:01:51,67
 a testimony against you at the last day

48
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:59,645
11 And now king Noah was about to release him, for

49
00:01:59,645 --> 00:02:07,645
 he feared his word; for he feared that the

50
00:02:07,645 --> 00:02:15,645
 judgments of God would come upon him

51
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:17,169
12 But the priests lifted up their voices against

52
00:02:17,169 --> 00:02:18,769
 him, and began to accuse him, saying: He has

53
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:20,369
 reviled the king. Therefore the king was stirred up in

54
00:02:20,369 --> 00:02:21,969
 anger against him, and he delivered him up that he

55
00:02:21,969 --> 00:02:23,569
 might be slain

56
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:31,543
13 And it came to pass that they took him and

57
00:02:31,543 --> 00:02:39,543
 bound him, and scourged his skin with faggots, yea,

58
00:02:39,543 --> 00:02:47,543
 even unto death

59
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:59,467
14 And now when the flames began to scorch him, he

60
00:02:59,467 --> 00:03:11,467
 cried unto them, saying

61
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:12,991
15 Behold, even as ye have done unto me, so shall

62
00:03:12,991 --> 00:03:14,591
 it come to pass that thy seed shall cause that

63
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:16,191
 many shall suffer the pains that I do suffer, even

64
00:03:16,191 --> 00:03:17,791
 the pains of death by fire; and this because they

65
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,391
 believe in the salvation of the Lord their God

66
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:24,699
16 And it will come to pass that ye shall be

67
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:30,032
 afflicted with all manner of diseases because of your

68
00:03:30,032 --> 00:03:35,365
 iniquities

69
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,315
17 Yea, and ye shall be smitten on every hand, and

70
00:03:37,315 --> 00:03:39,315
 shall be driven and scattered to and fro, even as

71
00:03:39,315 --> 00:03:41,315
 a wild flock is driven by wild and ferocious

72
00:03:41,315 --> 00:03:43,315
 beasts

73
00:03:43,29 --> 00:03:45,29
18 And in that day ye shall be hunted, and ye

74
00:03:45,29 --> 00:03:47,29
 shall be taken by the hand of your enemies, and then

75
00:03:47,29 --> 00:03:49,29
 ye shall suffer, as I suffer, the pains of death by

76
00:03:49,29 --> 00:03:51,29
 fire

77
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:55,264
19 Thus God executeth vengeance upon those that

78
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:59,264
 destroy his people. O God, receive my soul

79
00:03:59,239 --> 00:03:59,239
20 And now, when Abinadi had said these words, he

80
00:03:59,239 --> 00:03:59,239
 fell, having suffered death by fire; yea, having

81
00:03:59,239 --> 00:03:59,239
 been put to death because he would not deny the

82
00:03:59,239 --> 00:03:59,239
 commandments of God, having sealed the truth of his

83
00:03:59,239 --> 00:03:59,239
 words by his death.
