1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:09,0
Chapter 2 King Benjamin addresses his people—He

2
00:00:09,0 --> 00:00:18,0
recounts the equity, fairness, and spirituality

3
00:00:18,0 --> 00:00:27,0
of his reign—He counsels them to serve their

4
00:00:27,0 --> 00:00:36,0
Heavenly King—Those who rebel against God will

5
00:00:36,0 --> 00:00:45,712
suffer anguish like unquenchable fire. About 124 B.C. 

6
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:45,569
1 And it came to pass that after Mosiah had

7
00:00:45,569 --> 00:00:45,426
done as his father had commanded him, and

8
00:00:45,426 --> 00:00:45,283
had made a proclamation throughout all the

9
00:00:45,283 --> 00:00:45,14
land, that the people gathered themselves

10
00:00:45,14 --> 00:00:44,997
together throughout all the land, that they

11
00:00:44,997 --> 00:00:44,854
might go up to the temple to hear the words

12
00:00:44,854 --> 00:00:44,778
which king Benjamin should speak unto them.

13
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:44,528
2 And there were a great number,

14
00:00:44,528 --> 00:00:44,278
even so many that they did not number

15
00:00:44,278 --> 00:00:44,028
them; for they had multiplied

16
00:00:44,028 --> 00:00:43,844
exceedingly and waxed great in the land.

17
00:00:43,844 --> 00:00:43,594
3 And they also took of the

18
00:00:43,594 --> 00:00:43,344
firstlings of their flocks, that they

19
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:43,094
might offer sacrifice and burnt

20
00:00:43,094 --> 00:00:42,91
offerings according to the law of Moses;

21
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
4 And also that they might give

22
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
thanks to the Lord their God,

23
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
who had brought them out of the

24
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
land of Jerusalem, and who had

25
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
delivered them out of the

26
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
hands of their enemies, and had

27
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
appointed just men to be their

28
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
teachers, and also a just man to

29
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
be their king, who had

30
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
established peace in the land of

31
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
Zarahemla, and who had taught them to

32
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
keep the commandments of God,

33
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
that they might rejoice and be

34
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
filled with love towards God and all men.

35
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
5 And it came to pass that when

36
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
they came up to the temple,

37
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
they pitched their tents round

38
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
about, every man according to his

39
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
family, consisting of his

40
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
wife, and his sons, and his

41
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
daughters, and their sons, and their

42
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
daughters, from the eldest down

43
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
to the youngest, every family

44
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
being separate one from another.

45
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
6 And they pitched their

46
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
tents round about the temple,

47
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
every man having his tent

48
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
with the door thereof towards

49
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
the temple, that thereby they

50
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
might remain in their tents

51
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
and hear the words which

52
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
king Benjamin should speak unto them;

53
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
7 For the multitude being

54
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
so great that king

55
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
Benjamin could not teach them

56
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
all within the walls of

57
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
the temple, therefore he

58
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
caused a tower to be

59
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
erected, that thereby his

60
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
people might hear the words

61
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
which he should speak unto them.

62
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
8 And it came to pass

63
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
that he began to speak

64
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
to his people from the

65
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
tower; and they could

66
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
not all hear his words

67
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
because of the greatness

68
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
of the multitude;

69
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
therefore he caused that the

70
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
words which he spake

71
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
should be written and

72
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
sent forth among those

73
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
that were not under the

74
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
sound of his voice, that

75
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
they might also receive his words.

76
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
9 And these are the

77
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
words which he spake and

78
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
caused to be written,

79
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
saying: My brethren,

80
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
all ye that have

81
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
assembled yourselves

82
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
together, you that can hear

83
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
my words which I shall

84
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
speak unto you this

85
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
day; for I have not

86
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
commanded you to come up

87
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
hither to trifle with

88
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
the words which I

89
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
shall speak, but that you

90
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
should hearken unto

91
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
me, and open your ears

92
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
that ye may hear, and

93
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
your hearts that ye may

94
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
understand, and your

95
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
minds that the

96
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
mysteries of God may be unfolded to your view.

97
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
10 I have not

98
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
commanded you to come up

99
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
hither that ye

100
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
should fear me, or

101
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
that ye should think

102
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
that I of myself am

103
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
more than a mortal man.

104
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
11 But I am like

105
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
as yourselves,

106
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
subject to all manner

107
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
of infirmities in

108
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
body and mind; yet

109
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
I have been

110
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
chosen by this people,

111
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
and consecrated by

112
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
my father, and

113
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
was suffered by the

114
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
hand of the Lord

115
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
that I should be a

116
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
ruler and a king

117
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
over this people;

118
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
and have been kept

119
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
and preserved by

120
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
his matchless

121
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
power, to serve you

122
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
with all the might,

123
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
mind and strength

124
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
which the Lord hath granted unto me.

125
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
12 I say unto you

126
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
that as I have

127
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
been suffered to

128
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
spend my days in

129
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
your service, even

130
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
up to this time,

131
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
and have not

132
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
sought gold nor

133
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
silver nor any manner

134
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
of riches of you;

135
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
13 Neither have

136
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
I suffered that

137
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
ye should be

138
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
confined in

139
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
dungeons, nor that ye

140
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
should make

141
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
slaves one of

142
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
another, nor that ye

143
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
should murder, or

144
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
plunder, or

145
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
steal, or commit

146
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
adultery; nor even

147
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
have I suffered

148
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
that ye should

149
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
commit any manner

150
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
of wickedness,

151
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
and have taught

152
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
you that ye

153
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
should keep the

154
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
commandments of the

155
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
Lord, in all

156
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
things which he hath commanded you—

157
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
14 And even I,

158
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
myself, have

159
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
labored with mine

160
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
own hands that

161
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
I might serve

162
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
you, and that

163
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
ye should not be

164
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
laden with

165
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
taxes, and that

166
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
there should

167
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
nothing come upon

168
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
you which was

169
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
grievous to be

170
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
borne—and of all

171
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
these things

172
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
which I have

173
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
spoken, ye

174
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
yourselves are witnesses this day.

175
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
15 Yet, my

176
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
brethren, I have

177
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
not done these

178
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
things that I

179
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
might boast,

180
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
neither do I

181
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
tell these

182
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
things that

183
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
thereby I might

184
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
accuse you; but I

185
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
tell you these

186
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
things that

187
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
ye may know

188
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
that I can answer

189
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
a clear

190
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
conscience before God this day.

191
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
16 Behold, I

192
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
say unto you

193
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
that because

194
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
I said unto

195
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
you that I had

196
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
spent my

197
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
days in your

198
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
service, I do

199
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
not desire to

200
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
boast, for I

201
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
have only been

202
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
in the service of God.

203
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
17 And

204
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
behold, I tell

205
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
you these

206
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
things that ye

207
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:42,91
