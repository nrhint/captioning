00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 2 King Benjamin addresses his people—He

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
recounts the equity, fairness, and spirituality

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of his reign—He counsels them to serve their

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Heavenly King—Those who rebel against God will

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:07:29,
suffer anguish like unquenchable fire. About 124 B.C. 

6
00:07:29,0 --> 00:07:29,0
1 And it came to pass that after Mosiah had

7
00:07:29,0 --> 00:07:29,0
done as his father had commanded him, and

8
00:07:29,0 --> 00:07:29,0
had made a proclamation throughout all the

9
00:07:29,0 --> 00:07:29,0
land, that the people gathered themselves

10
00:07:29,0 --> 00:07:29,0
together throughout all the land, that they

11
00:07:29,0 --> 00:07:29,0
might go up to the temple to hear the words

12
00:07:29,0 --> 00:16:24,
which king Benjamin should speak unto them.

13
00:16:24,0 --> 00:16:24,0
2 And there were a great number,

14
00:16:24,0 --> 00:16:24,0
even so many that they did not number

15
00:16:24,0 --> 00:16:24,0
them; for they had multiplied

16
00:16:24,0 --> 00:18:08,
exceedingly and waxed great in the land.

17
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
3 And they also took of the

18
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
firstlings of their flocks, that they

19
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
might offer sacrifice and burnt

20
00:18:08,0 --> 00:21:39,
offerings according to the law of Moses;

21
00:21:39,0 --> 00:21:39,0
4 And also that they might give

22
00:21:39,0 --> 00:21:39,0
thanks to the Lord their God,

23
00:21:39,0 --> 00:21:39,0
who had brought them out of the

24
00:21:39,0 --> 00:21:39,0
land of Jerusalem, and who had

25
00:21:39,0 --> 00:21:39,0
delivered them out of the

26
00:21:39,0 --> 00:21:39,0
hands of their enemies, and had

27
00:21:39,0 --> 00:21:39,0
appointed just men to be their

28
00:21:39,0 --> 00:21:39,0
teachers, and also a just man to

29
00:21:39,0 --> 00:21:39,0
be their king, who had

30
00:21:39,0 --> 00:21:39,0
established peace in the land of

31
00:21:39,0 --> 00:21:39,0
Zarahemla, and who had taught them to

32
00:21:39,0 --> 00:21:39,0
keep the commandments of God,

33
00:21:39,0 --> 00:21:39,0
that they might rejoice and be

34
00:21:39,0 --> 00:21:11,
filled with love towards God and all men.

35
00:21:11,0 --> 00:21:11,0
5 And it came to pass that when

36
00:21:11,0 --> 00:21:11,0
they came up to the temple,

37
00:21:11,0 --> 00:21:11,0
they pitched their tents round

38
00:21:11,0 --> 00:21:11,0
about, every man according to his

39
00:21:11,0 --> 00:21:11,0
family, consisting of his

40
00:21:11,0 --> 00:21:11,0
wife, and his sons, and his

41
00:21:11,0 --> 00:21:11,0
daughters, and their sons, and their

42
00:21:11,0 --> 00:21:11,0
daughters, from the eldest down

43
00:21:11,0 --> 00:21:11,0
to the youngest, every family

44
00:21:11,0 --> 00:22:23,
being separate one from another.

45
00:22:23,0 --> 00:22:23,0
6 And they pitched their

46
00:22:23,0 --> 00:22:23,0
tents round about the temple,

47
00:22:23,0 --> 00:22:23,0
every man having his tent

48
00:22:23,0 --> 00:22:23,0
with the door thereof towards

49
00:22:23,0 --> 00:22:23,0
the temple, that thereby they

50
00:22:23,0 --> 00:22:23,0
might remain in their tents

51
00:22:23,0 --> 00:22:23,0
and hear the words which

52
00:22:23,0 --> 00:21:55,
king Benjamin should speak unto them;

53
00:21:55,0 --> 00:21:55,0
7 For the multitude being

54
00:21:55,0 --> 00:21:55,0
so great that king

55
00:21:55,0 --> 00:21:55,0
Benjamin could not teach them

56
00:21:55,0 --> 00:21:55,0
all within the walls of

57
00:21:55,0 --> 00:21:55,0
the temple, therefore he

58
00:21:55,0 --> 00:21:55,0
caused a tower to be

59
00:21:55,0 --> 00:21:55,0
erected, that thereby his

60
00:21:55,0 --> 00:21:55,0
people might hear the words

61
00:21:55,0 --> 00:21:27,
which he should speak unto them.

62
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
8 And it came to pass

63
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
that he began to speak

64
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
to his people from the

65
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
tower; and they could

66
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
not all hear his words

67
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
because of the greatness

68
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
of the multitude;

69
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
therefore he caused that the

70
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
words which he spake

71
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
should be written and

72
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
sent forth among those

73
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
that were not under the

74
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
sound of his voice, that

75
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,
they might also receive his words.

76
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
9 And these are the

77
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
words which he spake and

78
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
caused to be written,

79
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
saying: My brethren,

80
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
all ye that have

81
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
assembled yourselves

82
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
together, you that can hear

83
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
my words which I shall

84
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
speak unto you this

85
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
day; for I have not

86
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
commanded you to come up

87
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
hither to trifle with

88
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
the words which I

89
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
shall speak, but that you

90
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
should hearken unto

91
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
me, and open your ears

92
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
that ye may hear, and

93
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
your hearts that ye may

94
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
understand, and your

95
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
minds that the

96
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,
mysteries of God may be unfolded to your view.

97
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
10 I have not

98
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
commanded you to come up

99
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
hither that ye

100
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
should fear me, or

101
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
that ye should think

102
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
that I of myself am

103
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,
more than a mortal man.

104
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
11 But I am like

105
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
as yourselves,

106
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
subject to all manner

107
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
of infirmities in

108
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
body and mind; yet

109
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
I have been

110
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
chosen by this people,

111
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
and consecrated by

112
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
my father, and

113
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
was suffered by the

114
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
hand of the Lord

115
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
that I should be a

116
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
ruler and a king

117
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
over this people;

118
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
and have been kept

119
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
and preserved by

120
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
his matchless

121
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
power, to serve you

122
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
with all the might,

123
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
mind and strength

124
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,
which the Lord hath granted unto me.

125
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
12 I say unto you

126
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
that as I have

127
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
been suffered to

128
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
spend my days in

129
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
your service, even

130
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
up to this time,

131
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
and have not

132
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
sought gold nor

133
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
silver nor any manner

134
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,
of riches of you;

135
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
13 Neither have

136
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
I suffered that

137
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
ye should be

138
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
confined in

139
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
dungeons, nor that ye

140
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
should make

141
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
slaves one of

142
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
another, nor that ye

143
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
should murder, or

144
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
plunder, or

145
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
steal, or commit

146
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
adultery; nor even

147
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
have I suffered

148
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
that ye should

149
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
commit any manner

150
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
of wickedness,

151
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
and have taught

152
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
you that ye

153
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
should keep the

154
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
commandments of the

155
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
Lord, in all

156
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,
things which he hath commanded you—

157
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
14 And even I,

158
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
myself, have

159
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
labored with mine

160
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
own hands that

161
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
I might serve

162
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
you, and that

163
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
ye should not be

164
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
laden with

165
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
taxes, and that

166
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
there should

167
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
nothing come upon

168
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
you which was

169
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
grievous to be

170
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
borne—and of all

171
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
these things

172
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
which I have

173
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
spoken, ye

174
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,
yourselves are witnesses this day.

175
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
15 Yet, my

176
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
brethren, I have

177
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
not done these

178
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
things that I

179
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
might boast,

180
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
neither do I

181
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
tell these

182
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
things that

183
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
thereby I might

184
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
accuse you; but I

185
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
tell you these

186
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
things that

187
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
ye may know

188
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
that I can answer

189
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
a clear

190
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,
conscience before God this day.

191
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
16 Behold, I

192
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
say unto you

193
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
that because

194
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
I said unto

195
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
you that I had

196
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
spent my

197
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
days in your

198
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
service, I do

199
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
not desire to

200
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
boast, for I

201
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
have only been

202
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,
in the service of God.

203
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
17 And

204
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
behold, I tell

205
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
you these

206
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
things that ye

207
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
may learn

208
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
wisdom; that ye

209
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
may learn

210
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
that when ye

211
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
are in the

212
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
service of

213
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
your fellow

214
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
beings ye are

215
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
only in the

216
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,
service of your God.

217
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
18 Behold,

218
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
ye have

219
00:21:27,0 --> 00:21:27,0
