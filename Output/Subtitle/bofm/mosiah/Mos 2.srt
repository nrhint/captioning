1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:10,4
Chapter 2 King Benjamin addresses his people—He

2
00:00:10,4 --> 00:00:20,8
 recounts the equity, fairness, and spirituality of

3
00:00:20,8 --> 00:00:31,2
 his reign—He counsels them to serve their Heavenly

4
00:00:31,2 --> 00:00:41,6
 King—Those who rebel against God will suffer

5
00:00:41,6 --> 00:00:52,0
 anguish like unquenchable fire. About 124 B.C.

6
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:57,315
1 And it came to pass that after Mosiah had done

7
00:00:57,315 --> 00:01:01,744
 as his father had commanded him, and had made a

8
00:01:01,744 --> 00:01:06,173
 proclamation throughout all the land, that the people

9
00:01:06,173 --> 00:01:10,602
 gathered themselves together throughout all the

10
00:01:10,602 --> 00:01:15,031
 land, that they might go up to the temple to hear

11
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:19,46
 the words which king Benjamin should speak unto

12
00:01:19,46 --> 00:01:23,889
 them

13
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:30,716
2 And there were a great number, even so many that

14
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:38,049
 they did not number them; for they had multiplied

15
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:45,382
 exceedingly and waxed great in the land

16
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:52,039
3 And they also took of the firstlings of their

17
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:58,706
 flocks, that they might offer sacrifice and burnt

18
00:01:58,706 --> 00:02:05,373
 offerings according to the law of Moses

19
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:13,081
4 And also that they might give thanks to the Lord

20
00:02:13,081 --> 00:02:20,637
 their God, who had brought them out of the land

21
00:02:20,637 --> 00:02:28,193
 of Jerusalem, and who had delivered them out of the

22
00:02:28,193 --> 00:02:35,749
 hands of their enemies, and had appointed just

23
00:02:35,749 --> 00:02:43,305
 men to be their teachers, and also a just man to be

24
00:02:43,305 --> 00:02:50,861
 their king, who had established peace in the land

25
00:02:50,861 --> 00:02:58,417
 of Zarahemla, and who had taught them to keep the

26
00:02:58,417 --> 00:03:05,973
 commandments of God, that they might rejoice and

27
00:03:05,973 --> 00:03:13,529
 be filled with love towards God and all men

28
00:03:13,36 --> 00:03:15,646
5 And it came to pass that when they came up to

29
00:03:15,646 --> 00:03:17,932
 the temple, they pitched their tents round about,

30
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:20,218
 every man according to his family, consisting of his

31
00:03:20,218 --> 00:03:22,504
 wife, and his sons, and his daughters, and their

32
00:03:22,504 --> 00:03:24,79
 sons, and their daughters, from the eldest down to

33
00:03:24,79 --> 00:03:27,076
 the youngest, every family being separate one

34
00:03:27,076 --> 00:03:29,362
 from another

35
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:32,509
6 And they pitched their tents round about the

36
00:03:32,509 --> 00:03:35,709
 temple, every man having his tent with the door

37
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:38,909
 thereof towards the temple, that thereby they might

38
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:42,109
 remain in their tents and hear the words which king

39
00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:45,309
 Benjamin should speak unto them

40
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:50,058
7 For the multitude being so great that king

41
00:03:50,058 --> 00:03:54,858
 Benjamin could not teach them all within the walls of

42
00:03:54,858 --> 00:03:59,658
 the temple, therefore he caused a tower to be

43
00:03:59,658 --> 00:04:04,458
 erected, that thereby his people might hear the words

44
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:09,258
 which he should speak unto them

45
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:10,325
8 And it came to pass that he began to speak to

46
00:04:10,325 --> 00:04:11,468
 his people from the tower; and they could not all

47
00:04:11,468 --> 00:04:12,611
 hear his words because of the greatness of the

48
00:04:12,611 --> 00:04:13,754
 multitude; therefore he caused that the words which he

49
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:14,897
 spake should be written and sent forth among those

50
00:04:14,897 --> 00:04:16,04
 that were not under the sound of his voice, that

51
00:04:16,04 --> 00:04:17,183
 they might also receive his words

52
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:18,757
9 And these are the words which he spake and

53
00:04:18,757 --> 00:04:20,357
 caused to be written, saying: My brethren, all ye that

54
00:04:20,357 --> 00:04:21,957
 have assembled yourselves together, you that can

55
00:04:21,957 --> 00:04:23,557
 hear my words which I shall speak unto you this

56
00:04:23,557 --> 00:04:25,157
 day; for I have not commanded you to come up hither

57
00:04:25,157 --> 00:04:26,757
 to trifle with the words which I shall speak, but

58
00:04:26,757 --> 00:04:28,357
 that you should hearken unto me, and open your ears

59
00:04:28,357 --> 00:04:29,957
 that ye may hear, and your hearts that ye may

60
00:04:29,957 --> 00:04:31,557
 understand, and your minds that the mysteries of God

61
00:04:31,557 --> 00:04:33,157
 may be unfolded to your view

62
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:38,439
10 I have not commanded you to come up hither that

63
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:43,772
 ye should fear me, or that ye should think that I

64
00:04:43,772 --> 00:04:49,105
 of myself am more than a mortal man

65
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:50,055
11 But I am like as yourselves, subject to all

66
00:04:50,055 --> 00:04:51,055
 manner of infirmities in body and mind; yet I have

67
00:04:51,055 --> 00:04:52,055
 been chosen by this people, and consecrated by my

68
00:04:52,055 --> 00:04:53,055
 father, and was suffered by the hand of the Lord

69
00:04:53,055 --> 00:04:54,055
 that I should be a ruler and a king over this people;

70
00:04:54,055 --> 00:04:55,055
 and have been kept and preserved by his matchless

71
00:04:55,055 --> 00:04:56,055
 power, to serve you with all the might, mind and

72
00:04:56,055 --> 00:04:57,055
 strength which the Lord hath granted unto me

73
00:04:57,03 --> 00:05:04,78
12 I say unto you that as I have been suffered to

74
00:05:04,78 --> 00:05:12,53
 spend my days in your service, even up to this

75
00:05:12,53 --> 00:05:20,28
 time, and have not sought gold nor silver nor any

76
00:05:20,28 --> 00:05:28,03
 manner of riches of you

77
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:29,929
13 Neither have I suffered that ye should be

78
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:30,929
 confined in dungeons, nor that ye should make slaves

79
00:05:30,929 --> 00:05:31,929
 one of another, nor that ye should murder, or

80
00:05:31,929 --> 00:05:32,929
 plunder, or steal, or commit adultery; nor even have I

81
00:05:32,929 --> 00:05:33,929
 suffered that ye should commit any manner of

82
00:05:33,929 --> 00:05:34,929
 wickedness, and have taught you that ye should keep the

83
00:05:34,929 --> 00:05:35,929
 commandments of the Lord, in all things which he

84
00:05:35,929 --> 00:05:36,929
 hath commanded you

85
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:43,57
14 And even I, myself, have labored with mine own

86
00:05:43,57 --> 00:05:50,237
 hands that I might serve you, and that ye should

87
00:05:50,237 --> 00:05:56,904
 not be laden with taxes, and that there should

88
00:05:56,904 --> 00:06:03,571
 nothing come upon you which was grievous to be

89
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:10,238
 borne—and of all these things which I have spoken, ye

90
00:06:10,238 --> 00:06:16,905
 yourselves are witnesses this day

91
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:23,176
15 Yet, my brethren, I have not done these things

92
00:06:23,176 --> 00:06:29,576
 that I might boast, neither do I tell these things

93
00:06:29,576 --> 00:06:35,976
 that thereby I might accuse you; but I tell you

94
00:06:35,976 --> 00:06:42,376
 these things that ye may know that I can answer a

95
00:06:42,376 --> 00:06:48,776
 clear conscience before God this day

96
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:50,675
16 Behold, I say unto you that because I said unto

97
00:06:50,675 --> 00:06:52,675
 you that I had spent my days in your service, I

98
00:06:52,675 --> 00:06:54,675
 do not desire to boast, for I have only been in the

99
00:06:54,675 --> 00:06:56,675
 service of God

100
00:06:56,65 --> 00:06:58,65
17 And behold, I tell you these things that ye may

101
00:06:58,65 --> 00:07:00,65
 learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are

102
00:07:00,65 --> 00:07:02,65
 in the service of your fellow beings ye are only

103
00:07:02,65 --> 00:07:04,65
 in the service of your God

104
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:07,291
18 Behold, ye have called me your king; and if I,

105
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,958
 whom ye call your king, do labor to serve you,

106
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:12,625
 then ought not ye to labor to serve one another

107
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,199
19 And behold also, if I, whom ye call your king,

108
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:15,799
 who has spent his days in your service, and yet

109
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:17,399
 has been in the service of God, do merit any thanks

110
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,999
 from you, O how you ought to thank your heavenly

111
00:07:18,999 --> 00:07:20,599
 King

112
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:21,906
20 I say unto you, my brethren, that if you should

113
00:07:21,906 --> 00:07:23,239
 render all the thanks and praise which your whole

114
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:24,572
 soul has power to possess, to that God who has

115
00:07:24,572 --> 00:07:25,905
 created you, and has kept and preserved you, and has

116
00:07:25,905 --> 00:07:27,238
 caused that ye should rejoice, and has granted

117
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:28,571
 that ye should live in peace one with another

118
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:32,548
21 I say unto you that if ye should serve him who

119
00:07:32,548 --> 00:07:36,548
 has created you from the beginning, and is

120
00:07:36,548 --> 00:07:40,548
 preserving you from day to day, by lending you breath,

121
00:07:40,548 --> 00:07:44,548
 that ye may live and move and do according to your

122
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:48,548
 own will, and even supporting you from one moment

123
00:07:48,548 --> 00:07:52,548
 to another—I say, if ye should serve him with all

124
00:07:52,548 --> 00:07:56,548
 your whole souls yet ye would be unprofitable

125
00:07:56,548 --> 00:08:00,548
 servants

126
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:01,78
22 And behold, all that he requires of you is to

127
00:08:01,78 --> 00:08:03,113
 keep his commandments; and he has promised you that

128
00:08:03,113 --> 00:08:04,446
 if ye would keep his commandments ye should

129
00:08:04,446 --> 00:08:05,779
 prosper in the land; and he never doth vary from that

130
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:07,112
 which he hath said; therefore, if ye do keep his

131
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:08,445
 commandments he doth bless you and prosper you

132
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:19,088
23 And now, in the first place, he hath created

133
00:08:19,088 --> 00:08:29,755
 you, and granted unto you your lives, for which ye

134
00:08:29,755 --> 00:08:40,422
 are indebted unto him

135
00:08:40,32 --> 00:08:41,653
24 And secondly, he doth require that ye should do

136
00:08:41,653 --> 00:08:42,986
 as he hath commanded you; for which if ye do, he

137
00:08:42,986 --> 00:08:44,319
 doth immediately bless you; and therefore he hath

138
00:08:44,319 --> 00:08:45,652
 paid you. And ye are still indebted unto him, and

139
00:08:45,652 --> 00:08:46,985
 are, and will be, forever and ever; therefore, of

140
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,318
 what have ye to boast

141
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:49,894
25 And now I ask, can ye say aught of yourselves?

142
00:08:49,894 --> 00:08:51,494
 I answer you, Nay. Ye cannot say that ye are even

143
00:08:51,494 --> 00:08:53,094
 as much as the dust of the earth; yet ye were

144
00:08:53,094 --> 00:08:54,694
 created of the dust of the earth; but behold, it

145
00:08:54,694 --> 00:08:56,294
 belongeth to him who created you

146
00:08:56,269 --> 00:09:04,269
26 And I, even I, whom ye call your king, am no

147
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:12,269
 better than ye yourselves are; for I am also of the

148
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:20,269
 dust. And ye behold that I am old, and am about to

149
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:28,269
 yield up this mortal frame to its mother earth

150
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:29,168
27 Therefore, as I said unto you that I had served

151
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:30,168
 you, walking with a clear conscience before God,

152
00:09:30,168 --> 00:09:31,168
 even so I at this time have caused that ye should

153
00:09:31,168 --> 00:09:32,168
 assemble yourselves together, that I might be

154
00:09:32,168 --> 00:09:33,168
 found blameless, and that your blood should not come

155
00:09:33,168 --> 00:09:34,168
 upon me, when I shall stand to be judged of God of

156
00:09:34,168 --> 00:09:35,168
 the things whereof he hath commanded me concerning

157
00:09:35,168 --> 00:09:36,168
 you

158
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,285
28 I say unto you that I have caused that ye

159
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,428
 should assemble yourselves together that I might rid my

160
00:09:38,428 --> 00:09:39,571
 garments of your blood, at this period of time

161
00:09:39,571 --> 00:09:40,714
 when I am about to go down to my grave, that I might

162
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:41,857
 go down in peace, and my immortal spirit may join

163
00:09:41,857 --> 00:09:43,0
 the choirs above in singing the praises of a just

164
00:09:43,0 --> 00:09:44,143
 God

165
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:46,117
29 And moreover, I say unto you that I have caused

166
00:09:46,117 --> 00:09:48,117
 that ye should assemble yourselves together, that

167
00:09:48,117 --> 00:09:50,117
 I might declare unto you that I can no longer be

168
00:09:50,117 --> 00:09:52,117
 your teacher, nor your king

169
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,235
30 For even at this time, my whole frame doth

170
00:09:53,235 --> 00:09:54,377
 tremble exceedingly while attempting to speak unto

171
00:09:54,377 --> 00:09:55,52
 you; but the Lord God doth support me, and hath

172
00:09:55,52 --> 00:09:56,663
 suffered me that I should speak unto you, and hath

173
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:57,807
 commanded me that I should declare unto you this day,

174
00:09:57,807 --> 00:09:58,949
 that my son Mosiah is a king and a ruler over you

175
00:09:58,949 --> 00:10:00,092


176
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:00,955
31 And now, my brethren, I would that ye should do

177
00:10:00,955 --> 00:10:01,844
 as ye have hitherto done. As ye have kept my

178
00:10:01,844 --> 00:10:02,733
 commandments, and also the commandments of my father,

179
00:10:02,733 --> 00:10:03,622
 and have prospered, and have been kept from

180
00:10:03,622 --> 00:10:04,511
 falling into the hands of your enemies, even so if ye

181
00:10:04,511 --> 00:10:05,4
 shall keep the commandments of my son, or the

182
00:10:05,4 --> 00:10:06,289
 commandments of God which shall be delivered unto you by

183
00:10:06,289 --> 00:10:07,178
 him, ye shall prosper in the land, and your

184
00:10:07,178 --> 00:10:08,067
 enemies shall have no power over you

185
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:11,791
32 But, O my people, beware lest there shall arise

186
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:15,541
 contentions among you, and ye list to obey the

187
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:19,291
 evil spirit, which was spoken of by my father

188
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:23,041
 Mosiah

189
00:10:23,99 --> 00:10:25,133
33 For behold, there is a wo pronounced upon him

190
00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:26,276
 who listeth to obey that spirit; for if he listeth

191
00:10:26,276 --> 00:10:27,419
 to obey him, and remaineth and dieth in his sins,

192
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:28,562
 the same drinketh damnation to his own soul; for

193
00:10:28,562 --> 00:10:29,705
 he receiveth for his wages an everlasting

194
00:10:29,705 --> 00:10:30,848
 punishment, having transgressed the law of God contrary to

195
00:10:30,848 --> 00:10:31,991
 his own knowledge

196
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:32,854
34 I say unto you, that there are not any among

197
00:10:32,854 --> 00:10:33,743
 you, except it be your little children that have not

198
00:10:33,743 --> 00:10:34,632
 been taught concerning these things, but what

199
00:10:34,632 --> 00:10:35,521
 knoweth that ye are eternally indebted to your

200
00:10:35,521 --> 00:10:36,41
 heavenly Father, to render to him all that you have and

201
00:10:36,41 --> 00:10:37,299
 are; and also have been taught concerning the

202
00:10:37,299 --> 00:10:38,188
 records which contain the prophecies which have been

203
00:10:38,188 --> 00:10:39,077
 spoken by the holy prophets, even down to the time

204
00:10:39,077 --> 00:10:39,966
 our father, Lehi, left Jerusalem

205
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,939
35 And also, all that has been spoken by our

206
00:10:41,939 --> 00:10:43,939
 fathers until now. And behold, also, they spake that

207
00:10:43,939 --> 00:10:45,939
 which was commanded them of the Lord; therefore,

208
00:10:45,939 --> 00:10:47,939
 they are just and true

209
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:50,2
36 And now, I say unto you, my brethren, that

210
00:10:50,2 --> 00:10:52,486
 after ye have known and have been taught all these

211
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:54,772
 things, if ye should transgress and go contrary to

212
00:10:54,772 --> 00:10:57,058
 that which has been spoken, that ye do withdraw

213
00:10:57,058 --> 00:10:59,344
 yourselves from the Spirit of the Lord, that it may

214
00:10:59,344 --> 00:11:01,63
 have no place in you to guide you in wisdom’s paths

215
00:11:01,63 --> 00:11:03,916
 that ye may be blessed, prospered, and preserved

216
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:06,53
37 I say unto you, that the man that doeth this,

217
00:11:06,53 --> 00:11:09,197
 the same cometh out in open rebellion against God;

218
00:11:09,197 --> 00:11:11,864
 therefore he listeth to obey the evil spirit, and

219
00:11:11,864 --> 00:11:14,531
 becometh an enemy to all righteousness; therefore,

220
00:11:14,531 --> 00:11:17,198
 the Lord has no place in him, for he dwelleth not

221
00:11:17,198 --> 00:11:19,865
 in unholy temples

222
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:20,812
38 Therefore if that man repenteth not, and

223
00:11:20,812 --> 00:11:21,812
 remaineth and dieth an enemy to God, the demands of

224
00:11:21,812 --> 00:11:22,812
 divine justice do awaken his immortal soul to a lively

225
00:11:22,812 --> 00:11:23,812
 sense of his own guilt, which doth cause him to

226
00:11:23,812 --> 00:11:24,812
 shrink from the presence of the Lord, and doth fill

227
00:11:24,812 --> 00:11:25,812
 his breast with guilt, and pain, and anguish,

228
00:11:25,812 --> 00:11:26,812
 which is like an unquenchable fire, whose flame

229
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:27,812
 ascendeth up forever and ever

230
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:30,454
39 And now I say unto you, that mercy hath no

231
00:11:30,454 --> 00:11:33,121
 claim on that man; therefore his final doom is to

232
00:11:33,121 --> 00:11:35,788
 endure a never-ending torment

233
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:39,762
40 O, all ye old men, and also ye young men, and

234
00:11:39,762 --> 00:11:43,762
 you little children who can understand my words,

235
00:11:43,762 --> 00:11:47,762
 for I have spoken plainly unto you that ye might

236
00:11:47,762 --> 00:11:51,762
 understand, I pray that ye should awake to a

237
00:11:51,762 --> 00:11:55,762
 remembrance of the awful situation of those that have

238
00:11:55,762 --> 00:11:59,762
 fallen into transgression

239
00:11:59,686 --> 00:11:59,797
41 And moreover, I would desire that ye should

240
00:11:59,797 --> 00:11:59,908
 consider on the blessed and happy state of those that

241
00:11:59,908 --> 00:12:00,019
 keep the commandments of God. For behold, they

242
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:00,13
 are blessed in all things, both temporal and

243
00:12:00,13 --> 00:12:00,241
 spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they

244
00:12:00,241 --> 00:12:00,352
 are received into heaven, that thereby they may

245
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:00,463
 dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness.

246
00:12:00,463 --> 00:12:00,574
 O remember, remember that these things are true;

247
00:12:00,574 --> 00:12:00,685
 for the Lord God hath spoken it.
