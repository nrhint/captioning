1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 18 Alma preaches in private—He sets

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
forth the covenant of baptism and baptizes at the

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
waters of Mormon—He organizes the Church of Christ

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and ordains priests—They support themselves and

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
teach the people—Alma and his people flee from

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:06:11,
King Noah into the wilderness. About 147–145 B.C. 

7
00:06:11,0 --> 00:06:11,0
1 And now, it came to pass that Alma,

8
00:06:11,0 --> 00:06:11,0
who had fled from the servants of king

9
00:06:11,0 --> 00:06:11,0
Noah, repented of his sins and iniquities,

10
00:06:11,0 --> 00:06:11,0
and went about privately among the

11
00:06:11,0 --> 00:20:19,
people, and began to teach the words of Abinadi—

12
00:20:19,0 --> 00:20:19,0
2 Yea, concerning that which was to

13
00:20:19,0 --> 00:20:19,0
come, and also concerning the

14
00:20:19,0 --> 00:20:19,0
resurrection of the dead, and the redemption

15
00:20:19,0 --> 00:20:19,0
of the people, which was to be

16
00:20:19,0 --> 00:20:19,0
brought to pass through the power, and

17
00:20:19,0 --> 00:20:19,0
sufferings, and death of Christ, and his

18
00:20:19,0 --> 00:24:04,
resurrection and ascension into heaven.

19
00:24:04,0 --> 00:24:04,0
3 And as many as would hear his

20
00:24:04,0 --> 00:24:04,0
word he did teach. And he taught

21
00:24:04,0 --> 00:24:04,0
them privately, that it might not

22
00:24:04,0 --> 00:24:04,0
come to the knowledge of the

23
00:24:04,0 --> 00:23:36,
king. And many did believe his words.

24
00:23:36,0 --> 00:23:36,0
4 And it came to pass that as

25
00:23:36,0 --> 00:23:36,0
many as did believe him did

26
00:23:36,0 --> 00:23:36,0
go forth to a place which was

27
00:23:36,0 --> 00:23:36,0
called Mormon, having

28
00:23:36,0 --> 00:23:36,0
received its name from the king,

29
00:23:36,0 --> 00:23:36,0
being in the borders of the

30
00:23:36,0 --> 00:23:36,0
land having been infested, by

31
00:23:36,0 --> 00:26:04,
times or at seasons, by wild beasts.

32
00:26:04,0 --> 00:26:04,0
5 Now, there was in

33
00:26:04,0 --> 00:26:04,0
Mormon a fountain of pure

34
00:26:04,0 --> 00:26:04,0
water, and Alma resorted

35
00:26:04,0 --> 00:26:04,0
thither, there being near the

36
00:26:04,0 --> 00:26:04,0
water a thicket of small

37
00:26:04,0 --> 00:26:04,0
trees, where he did hide

38
00:26:04,0 --> 00:26:04,0
himself in the daytime

39
00:26:04,0 --> 00:27:16,
from the searches of the king.

40
00:27:16,0 --> 00:27:16,0
6 And it came to

41
00:27:16,0 --> 00:27:16,0
pass that as many as

42
00:27:16,0 --> 00:27:16,0
believed him went

43
00:27:16,0 --> 00:26:48,
thither to hear his words.

44
00:26:48,0 --> 00:26:48,0
7 And it came to

45
00:26:48,0 --> 00:26:48,0
pass after many days

46
00:26:48,0 --> 00:26:48,0
there were a goodly

47
00:26:48,0 --> 00:26:48,0
number gathered

48
00:26:48,0 --> 00:26:48,0
together at the place

49
00:26:48,0 --> 00:26:48,0
of Mormon, to hear

50
00:26:48,0 --> 00:26:48,0
the words of Alma.

51
00:26:48,0 --> 00:26:48,0
Yea, all were

52
00:26:48,0 --> 00:26:48,0
gathered together that

53
00:26:48,0 --> 00:26:48,0
believed on his

54
00:26:48,0 --> 00:26:48,0
word, to hear him. And

55
00:26:48,0 --> 00:26:48,0
he did teach them,

56
00:26:48,0 --> 00:26:48,0
and did preach

57
00:26:48,0 --> 00:26:48,0
unto them repentance,

58
00:26:48,0 --> 00:26:48,0
and redemption, and

59
00:26:48,0 --> 00:26:20,
faith on the Lord.

60
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
8 And it came to

61
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
pass that he said

62
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
unto them:

63
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
Behold, here are the

64
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
waters of Mormon

65
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
(for thus were

66
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
they called) and

67
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
now, as ye are

68
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
desirous to come into

69
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
the fold of God,

70
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
and to be called

71
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
his people, and

72
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
are willing to

73
00:26:20,0 --> 00:26:20,0
bear one another’s

74
00:26:20,0 --> 00:28:32,
burdens, that they may be light;

75
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
9 Yea, and are

76
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
willing to mourn

77
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
with those that

78
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
mourn; yea, and

79
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
comfort those

80
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
that stand in need

81
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
of comfort, and

82
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
to stand as

83
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
witnesses of God at

84
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
all times and

85
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
in all things,

86
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
and in all places

87
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
that ye may be

88
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
in, even until

89
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
death, that ye may

90
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
be redeemed of

91
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
God, and be

92
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
numbered with those

93
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
of the first

94
00:28:32,0 --> 00:28:32,0
resurrection, that

95
00:28:32,0 --> 00:41:41,
ye may have eternal life—

96
00:41:41,0 --> 00:41:41,0
10 Now I say

97
00:41:41,0 --> 00:41:41,0
unto you, if this

98
00:41:41,0 --> 00:41:41,0
be the desire

99
00:41:41,0 --> 00:41:41,0
of your hearts,

100
00:41:41,0 --> 00:41:41,0
what have you

101
00:41:41,0 --> 00:41:41,0
against being

102
00:41:41,0 --> 00:41:41,0
baptized in the

103
00:41:41,0 --> 00:41:41,0
name of the

104
00:41:41,0 --> 00:41:41,0
Lord, as a witness

105
00:41:41,0 --> 00:41:41,0
before him

106
00:41:41,0 --> 00:41:41,0
that ye have

107
00:41:41,0 --> 00:41:41,0
entered into a

108
00:41:41,0 --> 00:41:41,0
covenant with him,

109
00:41:41,0 --> 00:41:41,0
that ye will

110
00:41:41,0 --> 00:41:41,0
serve him and keep

111
00:41:41,0 --> 00:41:41,0
his

112
00:41:41,0 --> 00:41:41,0
commandments, that he may

113
00:41:41,0 --> 00:41:41,0
pour out his

114
00:41:41,0 --> 00:42:53,
Spirit more abundantly upon you?

115
00:42:53,0 --> 00:42:53,0
11 And now

116
00:42:53,0 --> 00:42:53,0
when the people

117
00:42:53,0 --> 00:42:53,0
had heard these

118
00:42:53,0 --> 00:42:53,0
words, they

119
00:42:53,0 --> 00:42:53,0
clapped their

120
00:42:53,0 --> 00:42:53,0
hands for joy,

121
00:42:53,0 --> 00:42:53,0
and exclaimed:

122
00:42:53,0 --> 00:42:53,0
This is the

123
00:42:53,0 --> 00:51:34,
desire of our hearts.

124
00:51:34,0 --> 00:51:34,0
12 And now it

125
00:51:34,0 --> 00:51:34,0
came to pass

126
00:51:34,0 --> 00:51:34,0
that Alma

127
00:51:34,0 --> 00:51:34,0
took Helam, he

128
00:51:34,0 --> 00:51:34,0
being one of

129
00:51:34,0 --> 00:51:34,0
the first,

130
00:51:34,0 --> 00:51:34,0
and went and

131
00:51:34,0 --> 00:51:34,0
stood forth in

132
00:51:34,0 --> 00:51:34,0
the water,

133
00:51:34,0 --> 00:51:34,0
and cried,

134
00:51:34,0 --> 00:51:34,0
saying: O Lord,

135
00:51:34,0 --> 00:51:34,0
pour out thy

136
00:51:34,0 --> 00:51:34,0
Spirit upon

137
00:51:34,0 --> 00:51:34,0
thy servant,

138
00:51:34,0 --> 00:51:34,0
that he may do

139
00:51:34,0 --> 00:51:34,0
this work

140
00:51:34,0 --> 00:53:18,
with holiness of heart.

141
00:53:18,0 --> 00:53:18,0
13 And when

142
00:53:18,0 --> 00:53:18,0
he had said

143
00:53:18,0 --> 00:53:18,0
these words,

144
00:53:18,0 --> 00:53:18,0
the Spirit

145
00:53:18,0 --> 00:53:18,0
of the Lord

146
00:53:18,0 --> 00:53:18,0
was upon

147
00:53:18,0 --> 00:53:18,0
him, and he

148
00:53:18,0 --> 00:53:18,0
said: Helam, I

149
00:53:18,0 --> 00:53:18,0
baptize

150
00:53:18,0 --> 00:53:18,0
thee, having

151
00:53:18,0 --> 00:53:18,0
authority from

152
00:53:18,0 --> 00:53:18,0
the Almighty

153
00:53:18,0 --> 00:53:18,0
God, as a

154
00:53:18,0 --> 00:53:18,0
testimony

155
00:53:18,0 --> 00:53:18,0
that ye have

156
00:53:18,0 --> 00:53:18,0
entered into a

157
00:53:18,0 --> 00:53:18,0
covenant to

158
00:53:18,0 --> 00:53:18,0
serve him

159
00:53:18,0 --> 00:53:18,0
until you are

160
00:53:18,0 --> 00:53:18,0
dead as to

161
00:53:18,0 --> 00:53:18,0
the mortal

162
00:53:18,0 --> 00:53:18,0
body; and may

163
00:53:18,0 --> 00:53:18,0
the Spirit

164
00:53:18,0 --> 00:53:18,0
of the Lord

165
00:53:18,0 --> 00:53:18,0
be poured

166
00:53:18,0 --> 00:53:18,0
out upon you;

167
00:53:18,0 --> 00:53:18,0
and may he

168
00:53:18,0 --> 00:53:18,0
grant unto

169
00:53:18,0 --> 00:53:18,0
you eternal

170
00:53:18,0 --> 00:53:18,0
life, through

171
00:53:18,0 --> 00:53:18,0
the

172
00:53:18,0 --> 00:53:18,0
redemption of

173
00:53:18,0 --> 00:53:18,0
Christ, whom he

174
00:53:18,0 --> 00:56:49,
has prepared from the foundation of the world.

175
00:56:49,0 --> 00:56:49,0
14 And

176
00:56:49,0 --> 00:56:49,0
after Alma had

177
00:56:49,0 --> 00:56:49,0
said these

178
00:56:49,0 --> 00:56:49,0
words, both

179
00:56:49,0 --> 00:56:49,0
Alma and

180
00:56:49,0 --> 00:56:49,0
Helam were

181
00:56:49,0 --> 00:56:49,0
buried in

182
00:56:49,0 --> 00:56:49,0
the water;

183
00:56:49,0 --> 00:56:49,0
and they

184
00:56:49,0 --> 00:56:49,0
arose and came

185
00:56:49,0 --> 00:56:49,0
forth out

186
00:56:49,0 --> 00:56:49,0
of the water

187
00:56:49,0 --> 00:56:49,0
rejoicing,

188
00:56:49,0 --> 00:56:49,0
being

189
00:56:49,0 --> 00:56:21,
filled with the Spirit.

190
00:56:21,0 --> 00:56:21,0
15 And

191
00:56:21,0 --> 00:56:21,0
again, Alma

192
00:56:21,0 --> 00:56:21,0
took

193
00:56:21,0 --> 00:56:21,0
another, and

194
00:56:21,0 --> 00:56:21,0
went forth a

195
00:56:21,0 --> 00:56:21,0
second

196
00:56:21,0 --> 00:56:21,0
time into the

197
00:56:21,0 --> 00:56:21,0
water,

198
00:56:21,0 --> 00:56:21,0
and baptized

199
00:56:21,0 --> 00:56:21,0
him

200
00:56:21,0 --> 00:56:21,0
according to

201
00:56:21,0 --> 00:56:21,0
the first,

202
00:56:21,0 --> 00:56:21,0
only he did

203
00:56:21,0 --> 00:56:21,0
not bury

204
00:56:21,0 --> 00:56:21,0
himself

205
00:56:21,0 --> 00:57:05,
again in the water.

206
00:57:05,0 --> 00:57:05,0
16 And

207
00:57:05,0 --> 00:57:05,0
after this

208
00:57:05,0 --> 00:57:05,0
manner he

209
00:57:05,0 --> 00:57:05,0
did

210
00:57:05,0 --> 00:57:05,0
baptize every

211
00:57:05,0 --> 00:57:05,0
one that

212
00:57:05,0 --> 00:57:05,0
went

213
00:57:05,0 --> 00:57:05,0
forth to the

214
00:57:05,0 --> 00:57:05,0
place of

215
00:57:05,0 --> 00:57:05,0
Mormon;

216
00:57:05,0 --> 00:57:05,0
and they

217
00:57:05,0 --> 00:57:05,0
were in

218
00:57:05,0 --> 00:57:05,0
number

219
00:57:05,0 --> 00:57:05,0
about two

220
00:57:05,0 --> 00:57:05,0
hundred and

221
00:57:05,0 --> 00:57:05,0
four

222
00:57:05,0 --> 00:57:05,0
souls; yea,

223
00:57:05,0 --> 00:57:05,0
