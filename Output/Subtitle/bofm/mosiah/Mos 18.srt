1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:06,333
Chapter 18 Alma preaches in private—He sets

2
00:00:06,333 --> 00:00:12,666
forth the covenant of baptism and baptizes at the

3
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:18,999
waters of Mormon—He organizes the Church of Christ

4
00:00:18,999 --> 00:00:25,332
and ordains priests—They support themselves and

5
00:00:25,332 --> 00:00:31,665
teach the people—Alma and his people flee from

6
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:38,205
King Noah into the wilderness. About 147–145 B.C. 

7
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:41,405
1 And now, it came to pass that Alma,

8
00:00:41,405 --> 00:00:44,605
who had fled from the servants of king

9
00:00:44,605 --> 00:00:47,805
Noah, repented of his sins and iniquities,

10
00:00:47,805 --> 00:00:51,005
and went about privately among the

11
00:00:51,005 --> 00:00:54,154
people, and began to teach the words of Abinadi—

12
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:54,011
2 Yea, concerning that which was to

13
00:00:54,011 --> 00:00:53,868
come, and also concerning the

14
00:00:53,868 --> 00:00:53,725
resurrection of the dead, and the redemption

15
00:00:53,725 --> 00:00:53,582
of the people, which was to be

16
00:00:53,582 --> 00:00:53,439
brought to pass through the power, and

17
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:53,296
sufferings, and death of Christ, and his

18
00:00:53,296 --> 00:00:53,22
resurrection and ascension into heaven.

19
00:00:53,22 --> 00:00:53,02
3 And as many as would hear his

20
00:00:53,02 --> 00:00:52,82
word he did teach. And he taught

21
00:00:52,82 --> 00:00:52,62
them privately, that it might not

22
00:00:52,62 --> 00:00:52,42
come to the knowledge of the

23
00:00:52,42 --> 00:00:52,286
king. And many did believe his words.

24
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:52,161
4 And it came to pass that as

25
00:00:52,161 --> 00:00:52,036
many as did believe him did

26
00:00:52,036 --> 00:00:51,911
go forth to a place which was

27
00:00:51,911 --> 00:00:51,786
called Mormon, having

28
00:00:51,786 --> 00:00:51,661
received its name from the king,

29
00:00:51,661 --> 00:00:51,536
being in the borders of the

30
00:00:51,536 --> 00:00:51,411
land having been infested, by

31
00:00:51,411 --> 00:00:51,351
times or at seasons, by wild beasts.

32
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
5 Now, there was in

33
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
Mormon a fountain of pure

34
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
water, and Alma resorted

35
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
thither, there being near the

36
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
water a thicket of small

37
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
trees, where he did hide

38
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
himself in the daytime

39
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,818
from the searches of the king.

40
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
6 And it came to

41
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
pass that as many as

42
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
believed him went

43
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,351
thither to hear his words.

44
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
7 And it came to

45
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
pass after many days

46
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
there were a goodly

47
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
number gathered

48
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
together at the place

49
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
of Mormon, to hear

50
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
the words of Alma.

51
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
Yea, all were

52
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
gathered together that

53
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
believed on his

54
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
word, to hear him. And

55
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
he did teach them,

56
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
and did preach

57
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
unto them repentance,

58
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
and redemption, and

59
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,818
faith on the Lord.

60
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
8 And it came to

61
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
pass that he said

62
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
unto them:

63
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
Behold, here are the

64
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
waters of Mormon

65
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
(for thus were

66
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
they called) and

67
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
now, as ye are

68
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
desirous to come into

69
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
the fold of God,

70
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
and to be called

71
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
his people, and

72
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
are willing to

73
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
bear one another’s

74
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,351
burdens, that they may be light;

75
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
9 Yea, and are

76
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
willing to mourn

77
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
with those that

78
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
mourn; yea, and

79
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
comfort those

80
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
that stand in need

81
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
of comfort, and

82
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
to stand as

83
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
witnesses of God at

84
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
all times and

85
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
in all things,

86
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
and in all places

87
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
that ye may be

88
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
in, even until

89
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
death, that ye may

90
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
be redeemed of

91
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
God, and be

92
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
numbered with those

93
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
of the first

94
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
resurrection, that

95
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,818
ye may have eternal life—

96
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
10 Now I say

97
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
unto you, if this

98
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
be the desire

99
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
of your hearts,

100
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
what have you

101
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
against being

102
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
baptized in the

103
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
name of the

104
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
Lord, as a witness

105
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
before him

106
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
that ye have

107
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
entered into a

108
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
covenant with him,

109
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
that ye will

110
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
serve him and keep

111
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
his

112
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
commandments, that he may

113
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
pour out his

114
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,351
Spirit more abundantly upon you?

115
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
11 And now

116
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
when the people

117
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
had heard these

118
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
words, they

119
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
clapped their

120
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
hands for joy,

121
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
and exclaimed:

122
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
This is the

123
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,818
desire of our hearts.

124
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
12 And now it

125
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
came to pass

126
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
that Alma

127
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
took Helam, he

128
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
being one of

129
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
the first,

130
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
and went and

131
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
stood forth in

132
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
the water,

133
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
and cried,

134
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
saying: O Lord,

135
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
pour out thy

136
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
Spirit upon

137
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
thy servant,

138
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
that he may do

139
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
this work

140
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,351
with holiness of heart.

141
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
13 And when

142
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
he had said

143
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
these words,

144
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
the Spirit

145
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
of the Lord

146
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
was upon

147
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
him, and he

148
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
said: Helam, I

149
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
baptize

150
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
thee, having

151
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
authority from

152
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
the Almighty

153
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
God, as a

154
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
testimony

155
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
that ye have

156
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
entered into a

157
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
covenant to

158
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
serve him

159
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
until you are

160
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
dead as to

161
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
the mortal

162
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
body; and may

163
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
the Spirit

164
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
of the Lord

165
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
be poured

166
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
out upon you;

167
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
and may he

168
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
grant unto

169
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
you eternal

170
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
life, through

171
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
the

172
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
redemption of

173
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
Christ, whom he

174
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,818
has prepared from the foundation of the world.

175
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
14 And

176
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
after Alma had

177
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
said these

178
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
words, both

179
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
Alma and

180
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
Helam were

181
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
buried in

182
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
the water;

183
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
and they

184
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
arose and came

185
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
forth out

186
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
of the water

187
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
rejoicing,

188
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,818
being

189
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:51,351
filled with the Spirit.

190
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
15 And

191
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
again, Alma

192
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
took

193
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
another, and

194
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
went forth a

195
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
second

196
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
time into the

197
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
water,

198
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
and baptized

199
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
him

200
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:51,351
according to
