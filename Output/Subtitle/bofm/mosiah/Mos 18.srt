1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,167
Chapter 18 Alma preaches in private—He sets forth

2
00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:02,334
 the covenant of baptism and baptizes at the waters

3
00:00:02,334 --> 00:00:03,501
 of Mormon—He organizes the Church of Christ and

4
00:00:03,501 --> 00:00:04,668
 ordains priests—They support themselves and teach

5
00:00:04,668 --> 00:00:05,835
 the people—Alma and his people flee from King Noah

6
00:00:05,835 --> 00:00:07,002
 into the wilderness. About 147–145 B.C.

7
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,575
1 And now, it came to pass that Alma, who had fled

8
00:00:09,575 --> 00:00:11,175
 from the servants of king Noah, repented of his

9
00:00:11,175 --> 00:00:12,775
 sins and iniquities, and went about privately among

10
00:00:12,775 --> 00:00:14,375
 the people, and began to teach the words of

11
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:15,975
 Abinadi

12
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:19,949
2 Yea, concerning that which was to come, and also

13
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:23,949
 concerning the resurrection of the dead, and the

14
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:27,949
 redemption of the people, which was to be brought

15
00:00:27,949 --> 00:00:31,949
 to pass through the power, and sufferings, and

16
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:35,949
 death of Christ, and his resurrection and ascension

17
00:00:35,949 --> 00:00:39,949
 into heaven

18
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,873
3 And as many as would hear his word he did teach.

19
00:00:41,873 --> 00:00:43,873
 And he taught them privately, that it might not

20
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:45,873
 come to the knowledge of the king. And many did

21
00:00:45,873 --> 00:00:47,873
 believe his words

22
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,448
4 And it came to pass that as many as did believe

23
00:00:49,448 --> 00:00:51,048
 him did go forth to a place which was called

24
00:00:51,048 --> 00:00:52,648
 Mormon, having received its name from the king, being

25
00:00:52,648 --> 00:00:54,248
 in the borders of the land having been infested, by

26
00:00:54,248 --> 00:00:55,848
 times or at seasons, by wild beasts

27
00:00:55,822 --> 00:01:08,622
5 Now, there was in Mormon a fountain of pure

28
00:01:08,622 --> 00:01:21,422
 water, and Alma resorted thither, there being near the

29
00:01:21,422 --> 00:01:34,222
 water a thicket of small trees, where he did hide

30
00:01:34,222 --> 00:01:47,022
 himself in the daytime from the searches of the

31
00:01:47,022 --> 00:01:59,822
 king

32
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:23,62
6 And it came to pass that as many as believed him

33
00:02:23,62 --> 00:02:47,62
 went thither to hear his words

34
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,753
7 And it came to pass after many days there were a

35
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:52,039
 goodly number gathered together at the place of

36
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:54,325
 Mormon, to hear the words of Alma. Yea, all were

37
00:02:54,325 --> 00:02:56,611
 gathered together that believed on his word, to hear

38
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:58,897
 him. And he did teach them, and did preach unto

39
00:02:58,897 --> 00:03:01,183
 them repentance, and redemption, and faith on the

40
00:03:01,183 --> 00:03:03,469
 Lord

41
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:04,75
8 And it came to pass that he said unto them:

42
00:03:04,75 --> 00:03:06,083
 Behold, here are the waters of Mormon (for thus were

43
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,416
 they called) and now, as ye are desirous to come

44
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:08,749
 into the fold of God, and to be called his people,

45
00:03:08,749 --> 00:03:10,082
 and are willing to bear one another’s burdens, that

46
00:03:10,082 --> 00:03:11,415
 they may be light

47
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:14,82
9 Yea, and are willing to mourn with those that

48
00:03:14,82 --> 00:03:18,249
 mourn; yea, and comfort those that stand in need of

49
00:03:18,249 --> 00:03:21,678
 comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God at all

50
00:03:21,678 --> 00:03:25,107
 times and in all things, and in all places that ye

51
00:03:25,107 --> 00:03:28,536
 may be in, even until death, that ye may be

52
00:03:28,536 --> 00:03:31,965
 redeemed of God, and be numbered with those of the first

53
00:03:31,965 --> 00:03:35,394
 resurrection, that ye may have eternal life

54
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,601
10 Now I say unto you, if this be the desire of

55
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:39,887
 your hearts, what have you against being baptized in

56
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,173
 the name of the Lord, as a witness before him

57
00:03:42,173 --> 00:03:44,459
 that ye have entered into a covenant with him, that

58
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,745
 ye will serve him and keep his commandments, that

59
00:03:46,745 --> 00:03:49,031
 he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon

60
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:51,317
 you

61
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,931
11 And now when the people had heard these words,

62
00:03:53,931 --> 00:03:56,598
 they clapped their hands for joy, and exclaimed:

63
00:03:56,598 --> 00:03:59,265
 This is the desire of our hearts

64
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,839
12 And now it came to pass that Alma took Helam,

65
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:02,439
 he being one of the first, and went and stood forth

66
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:04,039
 in the water, and cried, saying: O Lord, pour out

67
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,639
 thy Spirit upon thy servant, that he may do this

68
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:07,239
 work with holiness of heart

69
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:10,77
13 And when he had said these words, the Spirit of

70
00:04:10,77 --> 00:04:14,326
 the Lord was upon him, and he said: Helam, I

71
00:04:14,326 --> 00:04:17,882
 baptize thee, having authority from the Almighty God,

72
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:21,438
 as a testimony that ye have entered into a

73
00:04:21,438 --> 00:04:24,994
 covenant to serve him until you are dead as to the mortal

74
00:04:24,994 --> 00:04:28,55
 body; and may the Spirit of the Lord be poured

75
00:04:28,55 --> 00:04:32,106
 out upon you; and may he grant unto you eternal

76
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:35,662
 life, through the redemption of Christ, whom he has

77
00:04:35,662 --> 00:04:39,218
 prepared from the foundation of the world

78
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,112
14 And after Alma had said these words, both Alma

79
00:04:41,112 --> 00:04:43,112
 and Helam were buried in the water; and they arose

80
00:04:43,112 --> 00:04:45,112
 and came forth out of the water rejoicing, being

81
00:04:45,112 --> 00:04:47,112
 filled with the Spirit

82
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,087
15 And again, Alma took another, and went forth a

83
00:04:49,087 --> 00:04:51,087
 second time into the water, and baptized him

84
00:04:51,087 --> 00:04:53,087
 according to the first, only he did not bury himself

85
00:04:53,087 --> 00:04:55,087
 again in the water

86
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,661
16 And after this manner he did baptize every one

87
00:04:56,661 --> 00:04:58,261
 that went forth to the place of Mormon; and they

88
00:04:58,261 --> 00:04:59,861
 were in number about two hundred and four souls;

89
00:04:59,861 --> 00:05:01,461
 yea, and they were baptized in the waters of Mormon,

90
00:05:01,461 --> 00:05:03,061
 and were filled with the grace of God

91
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,036
17 And they were called the church of God, or the

92
00:05:05,036 --> 00:05:07,036
 church of Christ, from that time forward. And it

93
00:05:07,036 --> 00:05:09,036
 came to pass that whosoever was baptized by the

94
00:05:09,036 --> 00:05:11,036
 power and authority of God was added to his church

95
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:12,411
18 And it came to pass that Alma, having authority

96
00:05:12,411 --> 00:05:13,811
 from God, ordained priests; even one priest to

97
00:05:13,811 --> 00:05:15,211
 every fifty of their number did he ordain to preach

98
00:05:15,211 --> 00:05:16,611
 unto them, and to teach them concerning the things

99
00:05:16,611 --> 00:05:18,011
 pertaining to the kingdom of God

100
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,985
19 And he commanded them that they should teach

101
00:05:20,985 --> 00:05:22,985
 nothing save it were the things which he had taught,

102
00:05:22,985 --> 00:05:24,985
 and which had been spoken by the mouth of the

103
00:05:24,985 --> 00:05:26,985
 holy prophets

104
00:05:26,96 --> 00:05:29,627
20 Yea, even he commanded them that they should

105
00:05:29,627 --> 00:05:32,294
 preach nothing save it were repentance and faith on

106
00:05:32,294 --> 00:05:34,961
 the Lord, who had redeemed his people

107
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:36,535
21 And he commanded them that there should be no

108
00:05:36,535 --> 00:05:38,135
 contention one with another, but that they should

109
00:05:38,135 --> 00:05:39,735
 look forward with one eye, having one faith and one

110
00:05:39,735 --> 00:05:41,335
 baptism, having their hearts knit together in

111
00:05:41,335 --> 00:05:42,935
 unity and in love one towards another

112
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:46,909
22 And thus he commanded them to preach. And thus

113
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:50,909
 they became the children of God

114
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:54,884
23 And he commanded them that they should observe

115
00:05:54,884 --> 00:05:58,884
 the sabbath day, and keep it holy, and also every

116
00:05:58,884 --> 00:06:02,884
 day they should give thanks to the Lord their God

117
00:06:02,884 --> 00:06:06,884


118
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,5
24 And he also commanded them that the priests

119
00:06:09,5 --> 00:06:12,167
 whom he had ordained should labor with their own

120
00:06:12,167 --> 00:06:14,834
 hands for their support

121
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:16,408
25 And there was one day in every week that was

122
00:06:16,408 --> 00:06:18,008
 set apart that they should gather themselves

123
00:06:18,008 --> 00:06:19,608
 together to teach the people, and to worship the Lord

124
00:06:19,608 --> 00:06:21,208
 their God, and also, as often as it was in their

125
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:22,808
 power, to assemble themselves together

126
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,115
26 And the priests were not to depend upon the

127
00:06:24,115 --> 00:06:25,448
 people for their support; but for their labor they

128
00:06:25,448 --> 00:06:26,781
 were to receive the grace of God, that they might

129
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:28,114
 wax strong in the Spirit, having the knowledge of

130
00:06:28,114 --> 00:06:29,447
 God, that they might teach with power and authority

131
00:06:29,447 --> 00:06:30,78
 from God

132
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,09
27 And again Alma commanded that the people of the

133
00:06:32,09 --> 00:06:33,423
 church should impart of their substance, every

134
00:06:33,423 --> 00:06:34,756
 one according to that which he had; if he have more

135
00:06:34,756 --> 00:06:36,089
 abundantly he should impart more abundantly; and

136
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:37,422
 of him that had but little, but little should be

137
00:06:37,422 --> 00:06:38,755
 required; and to him that had not should be given

138
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,732
28 And thus they should impart of their substance

139
00:06:40,732 --> 00:06:42,732
 of their own free will and good desires towards

140
00:06:42,732 --> 00:06:44,732
 God, and to those priests that stood in need, yea,

141
00:06:44,732 --> 00:06:46,732
 and to every needy, naked soul

142
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,706
29 And this he said unto them, having been

143
00:06:48,706 --> 00:06:50,706
 commanded of God; and they did walk uprightly before God,

144
00:06:50,706 --> 00:06:52,706
 imparting to one another both temporally and

145
00:06:52,706 --> 00:06:54,706
 spiritually according to their needs and their wants

146
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:55,681
30 And now it came to pass that all this was done

147
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:56,681
 in Mormon, yea, by the waters of Mormon, in the

148
00:06:56,681 --> 00:06:57,681
 forest that was near the waters of Mormon; yea, the

149
00:06:57,681 --> 00:06:58,681
 place of Mormon, the waters of Mormon, the forest

150
00:06:58,681 --> 00:06:59,681
 of Mormon, how beautiful are they to the eyes of

151
00:06:59,681 --> 00:07:00,681
 them who there came to the knowledge of their

152
00:07:00,681 --> 00:07:01,681
 Redeemer; yea, and how blessed are they, for they shall

153
00:07:01,681 --> 00:07:02,681
 sing to his praise forever

154
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:05,323
31 And these things were done in the borders of

155
00:07:05,323 --> 00:07:07,99
 the land, that they might not come to the knowledge

156
00:07:07,99 --> 00:07:10,657
 of the king

157
00:07:10,63 --> 00:07:11,963
32 But behold, it came to pass that the king,

158
00:07:11,963 --> 00:07:13,296
 having discovered a movement among the people, sent

159
00:07:13,296 --> 00:07:14,629
 his servants to watch them. Therefore on the day

160
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:15,962
 that they were assembling themselves together to hear

161
00:07:15,962 --> 00:07:17,295
 the word of the Lord they were discovered unto

162
00:07:17,295 --> 00:07:18,628
 the king

163
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:21,272
33 And now the king said that Alma was stirring up

164
00:07:21,272 --> 00:07:23,939
 the people to rebellion against him; therefore he

165
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:26,606
 sent his army to destroy them

166
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,579
34 And it came to pass that Alma and the people of

167
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:30,579
 the Lord were apprised of the coming of the

168
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:32,579
 king’s army; therefore they took their tents and their

169
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:34,579
 families and departed into the wilderness

170
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:37,054
35 And they were in number about four hundred and

171
00:07:37,054 --> 00:07:39,554
 fifty souls.
