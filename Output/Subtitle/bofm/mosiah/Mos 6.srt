00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 6 King Benjamin records the names of the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
people and appoints priests to teach

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:06:11,
them—Mosiah reigns as a righteous king. About 124–121 B.C. 

4
00:06:11,0 --> 00:06:11,0
1 And now, king Benjamin thought it was

5
00:06:11,0 --> 00:06:11,0
expedient, after having finished speaking

6
00:06:11,0 --> 00:06:11,0
to the people, that he should take the

7
00:06:11,0 --> 00:06:11,0
names of all those who had entered into a

8
00:06:11,0 --> 00:17:39,
covenant with God to keep his commandments.

9
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
2 And it came to pass that there was not

10
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
one soul, except it were little children,

11
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
but who had entered into the covenant

12
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,
and had taken upon them the name of Christ.

13
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
3 And again, it came to pass that when

14
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
king Benjamin had made an end of all

15
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
these things, and had consecrated his son

16
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
Mosiah to be a ruler and a king over

17
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
his people, and had given him all the

18
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
charges concerning the kingdom, and also

19
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
had appointed priests to teach the

20
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
people, that thereby they might hear and

21
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
know the commandments of God, and to stir

22
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
them up in remembrance of the oath

23
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
which they had made, he dismissed the

24
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
multitude, and they returned, every one,

25
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,
according to their families, to their own houses.

26
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
4 And Mosiah began to reign in his

27
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
father’s stead. And he began to

28
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
reign in the thirtieth year of his

29
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
age, making in the whole, about

30
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
four hundred and seventy-six years

31
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,
from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem.

32
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
5 And king Benjamin lived

33
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,
three years and he died.

34
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
6 And it came to pass

35
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
that king Mosiah did walk

36
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
in the ways of the Lord,

37
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
and did observe his

38
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
judgments and his statutes,

39
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
and did keep his

40
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
commandments in all things

41
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,
whatsoever he commanded him.

42
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
7 And king Mosiah did

43
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
cause his people that

44
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
they should till the

45
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
earth. And he also,

46
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
himself, did till the earth,

47
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
that thereby he might

48
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
not become burdensome to

49
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
his people, that he

50
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
might do according to that

51
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
which his father had

52
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
done in all things. And

53
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
there was no contention

54
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,0
among all his people

55
00:17:39,0 --> 00:17:39,
for the space of three years.
