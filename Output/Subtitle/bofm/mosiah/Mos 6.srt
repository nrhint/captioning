00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:47,667
Chapter 6 King Benjamin records the names of the

2
00:00:47,667 --> 00:01:35,334
 people and appoints priests to teach them—Mosiah

3
00:01:35,334 --> 00:02:23,001
 reigns as a righteous king. About 124–121 B.C.

4
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:34,743
1 And now, king Benjamin thought it was expedient,

5
00:02:34,743 --> 00:02:45,943
 after having finished speaking to the people,

6
00:02:45,943 --> 00:02:57,143
 that he should take the names of all those who had

7
00:02:57,143 --> 00:03:08,343
 entered into a covenant with God to keep his

8
00:03:08,343 --> 00:03:19,543
 commandments

9
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:27,366
2 And it came to pass that there was not one soul,

10
00:03:27,366 --> 00:03:35,366
 except it were little children, but who had

11
00:03:35,366 --> 00:03:43,366
 entered into the covenant and had taken upon them the

12
00:03:43,366 --> 00:03:51,366
 name of Christ

13
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:51,991
3 And again, it came to pass that when king

14
00:03:51,991 --> 00:03:52,718
 Benjamin had made an end of all these things, and had

15
00:03:52,718 --> 00:03:53,445
 consecrated his son Mosiah to be a ruler and a king

16
00:03:53,445 --> 00:03:54,172
 over his people, and had given him all the charges

17
00:03:54,172 --> 00:03:54,899
 concerning the kingdom, and also had appointed

18
00:03:54,899 --> 00:03:55,626
 priests to teach the people, that thereby they might

19
00:03:55,626 --> 00:03:56,353
 hear and know the commandments of God, and to

20
00:03:56,353 --> 00:03:57,08
 stir them up in remembrance of the oath which they

21
00:03:57,08 --> 00:03:57,807
 had made, he dismissed the multitude, and they

22
00:03:57,807 --> 00:03:58,534
 returned, every one, according to their families, to

23
00:03:58,534 --> 00:03:59,261
 their own houses

24
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,839
4 And Mosiah began to reign in his father’s stead.

25
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:02,439
 And he began to reign in the thirtieth year of

26
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:04,039
 his age, making in the whole, about four hundred and

27
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,639
 seventy-six years from the time that Lehi left

28
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:07,239
 Jerusalem

29
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:23,686
7 And king Mosiah did cause his people that they

30
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:23,829
 should till the earth. And he also, himself, did

31
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:23,972
 till the earth, that thereby he might not become

32
00:02:23,972 --> 00:02:24,115
 burdensome to his people, that he might do according

33
00:02:24,115 --> 00:02:24,258
 to that which his father had done in all things.

34
00:02:24,258 --> 00:02:24,401
 And there was no contention among all his people

35
00:02:24,401 --> 00:02:24,544
 for the space of three years.
