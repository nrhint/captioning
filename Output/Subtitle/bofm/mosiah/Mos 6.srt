00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:13,667
Chapter 6 King Benjamin records the names of the

2
00:00:13,667 --> 00:00:27,334
people and appoints priests to teach

3
00:00:27,334 --> 00:00:41,341
them—Mosiah reigns as a righteous king. About 124–121 B.C. 

4
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:44,141
1 And now, king Benjamin thought it was

5
00:00:44,141 --> 00:00:46,941
expedient, after having finished speaking

6
00:00:46,941 --> 00:00:49,741
to the people, that he should take the

7
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:52,541
names of all those who had entered into a

8
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:55,188
covenant with God to keep his commandments.

9
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:56,938
2 And it came to pass that there was not

10
00:00:56,938 --> 00:00:58,688
one soul, except it were little children,

11
00:00:58,688 --> 00:01:00,438
but who had entered into the covenant

12
00:01:00,438 --> 00:01:02,229
and had taken upon them the name of Christ.

13
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:02,46
3 And again, it came to pass that when

14
00:01:02,46 --> 00:01:02,691
king Benjamin had made an end of all

15
00:01:02,691 --> 00:01:02,922
these things, and had consecrated his son

16
00:01:02,922 --> 00:01:03,153
Mosiah to be a ruler and a king over

17
00:01:03,153 --> 00:01:03,384
his people, and had given him all the

18
00:01:03,384 --> 00:01:03,615
charges concerning the kingdom, and also

19
00:01:03,615 --> 00:01:03,846
had appointed priests to teach the

20
00:01:03,846 --> 00:01:04,077
people, that thereby they might hear and

21
00:01:04,077 --> 00:01:04,308
know the commandments of God, and to stir

22
00:01:04,308 --> 00:01:04,539
them up in remembrance of the oath

23
00:01:04,539 --> 00:01:04,77
which they had made, he dismissed the

24
00:01:04,77 --> 00:01:05,001
multitude, and they returned, every one,

25
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:05,699
according to their families, to their own houses.

26
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:07,366
4 And Mosiah began to reign in his

27
00:01:07,366 --> 00:01:09,033
father’s stead. And he began to

28
00:01:09,033 --> 00:01:10,7
reign in the thirtieth year of his

29
00:01:10,7 --> 00:01:12,367
age, making in the whole, about

30
00:01:12,367 --> 00:01:14,034
four hundred and seventy-six years

31
00:01:14,034 --> 00:01:15,576
from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem.

32
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:19,076
5 And king Benjamin lived

33
00:01:19,076 --> 00:01:22,616
three years and he died.

34
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:23,866
6 And it came to pass

35
00:01:23,866 --> 00:01:25,116
that king Mosiah did walk

36
00:01:25,116 --> 00:01:26,366
in the ways of the Lord,

37
00:01:26,366 --> 00:01:27,616
and did observe his

38
00:01:27,616 --> 00:01:28,866
judgments and his statutes,

39
00:01:28,866 --> 00:01:30,116
and did keep his

40
00:01:30,116 --> 00:01:31,366
commandments in all things

41
00:01:31,366 --> 00:01:32,492
whatsoever he commanded him.

42
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:33,206
7 And king Mosiah did

43
00:01:33,206 --> 00:01:33,92
cause his people that

44
00:01:33,92 --> 00:01:34,634
they should till the

45
00:01:34,634 --> 00:01:35,348
earth. And he also,

46
00:01:35,348 --> 00:01:36,062
himself, did till the earth,

47
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:36,776
that thereby he might

48
00:01:36,776 --> 00:01:37,49
not become burdensome to

49
00:01:37,49 --> 00:01:38,204
his people, that he

50
00:01:38,204 --> 00:01:38,918
might do according to that

51
00:01:38,918 --> 00:01:39,632
which his father had

52
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:40,346
done in all things. And

53
00:01:40,346 --> 00:01:41,06
there was no contention

54
00:01:41,06 --> 00:01:41,774
among all his people

55
00:01:41,774 --> 00:01:42,369
for the space of three years.
