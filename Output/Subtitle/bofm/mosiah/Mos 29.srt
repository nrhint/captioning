00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:02,833
Chapter 29 Mosiah proposes that judges be

2
00:00:02,833 --> 00:00:05,666
chosen in place of a king—Unrighteous kings lead

3
00:00:05,666 --> 00:00:08,499
their people into sin—Alma the younger is

4
00:00:08,499 --> 00:00:11,332
chosen chief judge by the voice of the

5
00:00:11,332 --> 00:00:14,165
people—He is also the high priest over the

6
00:00:14,165 --> 00:00:17,851
Church—Alma the elder and Mosiah die. About 92–91 B.C. 

7
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,601
1 Now when Mosiah had done this he

8
00:00:19,601 --> 00:00:21,351
sent out throughout all the land, among

9
00:00:21,351 --> 00:00:23,101
all the people, desiring to know their

10
00:00:23,101 --> 00:00:24,191
will concerning who should be their king.

11
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:24,941
2 And it came to pass that the

12
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:25,691
voice of the people came, saying:

13
00:00:25,691 --> 00:00:26,441
We are desirous that Aaron thy son

14
00:00:26,441 --> 00:00:27,194
should be our king and our ruler.

15
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:29,194
3 Now Aaron had gone up to the

16
00:00:29,194 --> 00:00:31,194
land of Nephi, therefore the king

17
00:00:31,194 --> 00:00:33,194
could not confer the kingdom

18
00:00:33,194 --> 00:00:35,194
upon him; neither would Aaron take

19
00:00:35,194 --> 00:00:37,194
upon him the kingdom; neither

20
00:00:37,194 --> 00:00:39,194
were any of the sons of Mosiah

21
00:00:39,194 --> 00:00:41,475
willing to take upon them the kingdom.

22
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:41,675
4 Therefore king Mosiah sent

23
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:41,875
again among the people; yea, even

24
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:42,075
a written word sent he among

25
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:42,275
the people. And these were the

26
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:42,943
words that were written, saying:

27
00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:45,443
5 Behold, O ye my people, or

28
00:00:45,443 --> 00:00:47,943
my brethren, for I esteem you

29
00:00:47,943 --> 00:00:50,443
as such, I desire that ye

30
00:00:50,443 --> 00:00:52,943
should consider the cause which

31
00:00:52,943 --> 00:00:55,443
ye are called to

32
00:00:55,443 --> 00:00:57,958
consider—for ye are desirous to have a king.

33
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:57,958
6 Now I declare unto you

34
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:57,958
that he to whom the

35
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:57,958
kingdom doth rightly belong

36
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:57,958
has declined, and will not

37
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:57,024
take upon him the kingdom.

38
00:00:57,024 --> 00:00:56,968
7 And now if there

39
00:00:56,968 --> 00:00:56,912
should be another appointed

40
00:00:56,912 --> 00:00:56,856
in his stead, behold I

41
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:56,8
fear there would rise

42
00:00:56,8 --> 00:00:56,744
contentions among you.

43
00:00:56,744 --> 00:00:56,688
And who knoweth but

44
00:00:56,688 --> 00:00:56,632
what my son, to whom the

45
00:00:56,632 --> 00:00:56,576
kingdom doth belong,

46
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:56,52
should turn to be angry

47
00:00:56,52 --> 00:00:56,464
and draw away a part of

48
00:00:56,464 --> 00:00:56,408
this people after him,

49
00:00:56,408 --> 00:00:56,352
which would cause wars

50
00:00:56,352 --> 00:00:56,296
and contentions among

51
00:00:56,296 --> 00:00:56,24
you, which would be the

52
00:00:56,24 --> 00:00:56,184
cause of shedding much

53
00:00:56,184 --> 00:00:56,128
blood and perverting the

54
00:00:56,128 --> 00:00:56,072
way of the Lord, yea,

55
00:00:56,072 --> 00:00:56,089
and destroy the souls of many people.

56
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:55,978
8 Now I say unto you

57
00:00:55,978 --> 00:00:55,867
let us be wise and

58
00:00:55,867 --> 00:00:55,756
consider these things,

59
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:55,645
for we have no right

60
00:00:55,645 --> 00:00:55,534
to destroy my son,

61
00:00:55,534 --> 00:00:55,423
neither should we have

62
00:00:55,423 --> 00:00:55,312
any right to destroy

63
00:00:55,312 --> 00:00:55,201
another if he should

64
00:00:55,201 --> 00:00:55,155
be appointed in his stead.

65
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:55,055
9 And if my son

66
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:54,955
should turn again to his

67
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:54,855
pride and vain

68
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:54,755
things he would recall

69
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:54,655
the things which he

70
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:54,555
had said, and claim

71
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:54,455
his right to the

72
00:00:54,455 --> 00:00:54,355
kingdom, which would

73
00:00:54,355 --> 00:00:54,255
cause him and also this

74
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:54,221
people to commit much sin.

75
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:54,388
10 And now let us

76
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:54,555
be wise and look

77
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:54,722
forward to these

78
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:54,889
things, and do that

79
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:55,056
which will make for the

80
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:55,222
peace of this people.

81
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:55,16
11 Therefore I

82
00:00:55,16 --> 00:00:55,098
will be your king the

83
00:00:55,098 --> 00:00:55,036
remainder of my

84
00:00:55,036 --> 00:00:54,974
days; nevertheless,

85
00:00:54,974 --> 00:00:54,912
let us appoint

86
00:00:54,912 --> 00:00:54,85
judges, to judge

87
00:00:54,85 --> 00:00:54,788
this people according

88
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:54,726
to our law; and

89
00:00:54,726 --> 00:00:54,664
we will newly

90
00:00:54,664 --> 00:00:54,602
arrange the affairs of

91
00:00:54,602 --> 00:00:54,54
this people, for

92
00:00:54,54 --> 00:00:54,478
we will appoint

93
00:00:54,478 --> 00:00:54,416
wise men to be

94
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:54,354
judges, that will judge

95
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:54,292
this people

96
00:00:54,292 --> 00:00:54,288
according to the commandments of God.

97
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:54,399
12 Now it is

98
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:54,51
better that a man

99
00:00:54,51 --> 00:00:54,621
should be judged of

100
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:54,732
God than of man,

101
00:00:54,732 --> 00:00:54,843
for the judgments

102
00:00:54,843 --> 00:00:54,954
of God are

103
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:55,065
always just, but the

104
00:00:55,065 --> 00:00:55,176
judgments of man

105
00:00:55,176 --> 00:00:55,289
are not always just.

106
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:55,247
13 Therefore, if

107
00:00:55,247 --> 00:00:55,205
it were

108
00:00:55,205 --> 00:00:55,163
possible that you could

109
00:00:55,163 --> 00:00:55,121
have just men

110
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:55,079
to be your kings,

111
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:55,037
who would

112
00:00:55,037 --> 00:00:54,995
establish the laws of

113
00:00:54,995 --> 00:00:54,953
God, and judge

114
00:00:54,953 --> 00:00:54,911
this people

115
00:00:54,911 --> 00:00:54,869
according to his

116
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:54,827
commandments, yea,

117
00:00:54,827 --> 00:00:54,785
if ye could have

118
00:00:54,785 --> 00:00:54,743
men for your

119
00:00:54,743 --> 00:00:54,701
kings who would do

120
00:00:54,701 --> 00:00:54,659
even as my

121
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:54,617
father Benjamin did

122
00:00:54,617 --> 00:00:54,575
for this

123
00:00:54,575 --> 00:00:54,533
people—I say unto you,

124
00:00:54,533 --> 00:00:54,491
if this could

125
00:00:54,491 --> 00:00:54,449
always be the case

126
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:54,407
then it would

127
00:00:54,407 --> 00:00:54,365
be expedient that

128
00:00:54,365 --> 00:00:54,323
ye should

129
00:00:54,323 --> 00:00:54,354
always have kings to rule over you.

130
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:54,301
14 And even I

131
00:00:54,301 --> 00:00:54,248
myself have

132
00:00:54,248 --> 00:00:54,195
labored with all

133
00:00:54,195 --> 00:00:54,142
the power and

134
00:00:54,142 --> 00:00:54,089
faculties which I

135
00:00:54,089 --> 00:00:54,036
have possessed,

136
00:00:54,036 --> 00:00:53,983
to teach you

137
00:00:53,983 --> 00:00:53,93
the commandments

138
00:00:53,93 --> 00:00:53,877
of God, and to

139
00:00:53,877 --> 00:00:53,824
establish

140
00:00:53,824 --> 00:00:53,771
peace throughout

141
00:00:53,771 --> 00:00:53,718
the land, that

142
00:00:53,718 --> 00:00:53,665
there should be

143
00:00:53,665 --> 00:00:53,612
no wars nor

144
00:00:53,612 --> 00:00:53,559
contentions, no

145
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:53,506
stealing, nor

146
00:00:53,506 --> 00:00:53,453
plundering, nor

147
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:53,4
murdering, nor any

148
00:00:53,4 --> 00:00:53,42
manner of iniquity;

149
00:00:53,42 --> 00:00:53,67
15 And

150
00:00:53,67 --> 00:00:53,92
whosoever has

151
00:00:53,92 --> 00:00:54,17
committed iniquity,

152
00:00:54,17 --> 00:00:54,42
him have I

153
00:00:54,42 --> 00:00:54,67
punished according

154
00:00:54,67 --> 00:00:54,92
to the crime

155
00:00:54,92 --> 00:00:55,17
which he has

156
00:00:55,17 --> 00:00:55,42
committed,

157
00:00:55,42 --> 00:00:55,67
according to the

158
00:00:55,67 --> 00:00:55,92
law which has

159
00:00:55,92 --> 00:00:56,17
been given to

160
00:00:56,17 --> 00:00:56,89
us by our fathers.

161
00:00:56,89 --> 00:00:56,79
16 Now I say

162
00:00:56,79 --> 00:00:56,69
unto you,

163
00:00:56,69 --> 00:00:56,59
that because all

164
00:00:56,59 --> 00:00:56,49
men are not

165
00:00:56,49 --> 00:00:56,39
just it is

166
00:00:56,39 --> 00:00:56,29
not expedient

167
00:00:56,29 --> 00:00:56,19
that ye should

168
00:00:56,19 --> 00:00:56,09
have a king

169
00:00:56,09 --> 00:00:55,99
or kings to

170
00:00:55,99 --> 00:00:55,956
rule over you.

171
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:55,956
17 For

172
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:55,956
behold, how much

173
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:55,956
iniquity

174
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:55,956
doth one wicked

175
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:55,956
king cause

176
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:55,956
to be

177
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:55,956
committed, yea,

178
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:55,956
and what great

179
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:55,022
destruction!

180
00:00:55,022 --> 00:00:54,972
18 Yea,

181
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:54,922
remember king

182
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:54,872
Noah, his

183
00:00:54,872 --> 00:00:54,822
wickedness

184
00:00:54,822 --> 00:00:54,772
and his

185
00:00:54,772 --> 00:00:54,722
abominations,

186
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:54,672
and also the

187
00:00:54,672 --> 00:00:54,622
wickedness

188
00:00:54,622 --> 00:00:54,572
and

189
00:00:54,572 --> 00:00:54,522
abominations of

190
00:00:54,522 --> 00:00:54,472
his people.

191
00:00:54,472 --> 00:00:54,422
Behold what

192
00:00:54,422 --> 00:00:54,372
great

193
00:00:54,372 --> 00:00:54,322
destruction did

194
00:00:54,322 --> 00:00:54,272
come upon

195
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:54,222
them; and

196
00:00:54,222 --> 00:00:54,172
also because

197
00:00:54,172 --> 00:00:54,122
of their

198
00:00:54,122 --> 00:00:54,072
iniquities

199
00:00:54,072 --> 00:00:54,087
they were brought into bondage.

200
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
19 And

201
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
were it not

202
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
for the

203
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
interposition

204
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
of their

205
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
all-wise

206
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
Creator,

207
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
and this

208
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
because of

209
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
their

210
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
sincere

211
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
repentance, they

212
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
must

213
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
unavoidably

214
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
remain in bondage until now.

215
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
20 But

216
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
behold, he

217
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
did deliver

218
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
them

219
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
because they

220
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
did humble

221
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
themselves

222
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
before

223
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
him; and

224
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
because they

225
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
cried

226
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
mightily unto

227
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
him he did

228
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
deliver

229
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
them out of

230
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
bondage;

231
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
and thus

232
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
doth the

233
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
Lord work

234
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
with his

235
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
power in all

236
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
cases among

237
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
the

238
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
children of

239
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
men,

240
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
extending the arm

241
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
of mercy

242
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
towards

243
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
them that put

244
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
their

245
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
trust in him.

246
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
21 And

247
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
behold, now I

248
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
say unto

249
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
you, ye

250
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
cannot

251
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
dethrone an

252
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
iniquitous

253
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
king save it

254
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
be

255
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
through much

256
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
contention,

257
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
and the

258
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
shedding of

259
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
much blood.

260
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
22 For

261
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
behold, he

262
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
has his

263
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
friends in

264
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087


265
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
iniquity, and he

266
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
keepeth

267
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
his guards

268
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
about

269
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
him; and he

270
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
teareth

271
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
up the

272
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
laws of

273
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
those who

274
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
have

275
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
reigned in

276
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
righteousness

277
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
before

278
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
him; and

279
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
he

280
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
trampleth under

281
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
his feet

282
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
the commandments of God;

283
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
23 And

284
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
he

285
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
enacteth laws,

286
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087

sendeth

288
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
them forth

289
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
among

290
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
his

291
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
people, yea,

292
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
laws

293
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
after the

294
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
manner of

295
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
his own

296
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087


297
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
wickedness; and

298
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087


299
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
whosoever doth

300
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
not obey

301
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
his laws

302
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
he

303
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
causeth to

304
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
be

305
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
destroyed; and

306
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087


307
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
whosoever doth

308
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
rebel

309
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
against

310
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
him he

311
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
will send

312
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
his

313
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
armies

314
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
against them

315
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
to war,

316
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
and if he

317
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
can he

318
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
will

319
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
destroy

320
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
them; and

321
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
thus an

322
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087


323
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
unrighteous king

324
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
doth pervert the ways of all righteousness.

325
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
24 And

326
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
now

327
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
behold I

328
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
say unto

329
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
you,

330
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
it is

331
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
not

332
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
expedient

333
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
that such

334
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087


335
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
abominations

336
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
should

337
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
come upon you.

338
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
25

339
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
Therefore,

340
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
choose

341
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
you by

342
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
the

343
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
voice of

344
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
this

345
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
people,

346
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
judges,

347
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
that ye

348
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
may be

349
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
judged

350
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087


351
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
according to

352
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
the laws

353
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
which

354
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
have

355
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
been

356
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
given you

357
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
by our

358
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
fathers,

359
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
which

360
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
are

361
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
correct,

362
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
and

363
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
which were

364
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
given

365
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
them by

366
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
the

367
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
hand of

368
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
the Lord.

369
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
26 Now

370
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
it is

371
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
not

372
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
common

373
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
that

374
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
the

375
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
voice of

376
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
the

377
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
people

378
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087


379
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
desireth

380
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
anything

381
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087


382
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
contrary to

383
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
that

384
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
which is

385
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087


386
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
right; but

387
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
it is

388
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
common

389
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
for

390
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
the

391
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
lesser

392
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
part of

393
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
the

394
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
people

395
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
to

396
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
desire

397
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
that

398
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
which is

399
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
not

400
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
right;

401
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087


402
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
therefore this

403
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
shall

404
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087

405
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
observe

406
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
and

407
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
make it

408
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
your

409
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
law—to

410
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
do your business by the voice of the people.

411
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,087
