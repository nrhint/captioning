00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 29 Mosiah proposes that judges be

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
chosen in place of a king—Unrighteous kings lead

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
their people into sin—Alma the younger is

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
chosen chief judge by the voice of the

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
people—He is also the high priest over the

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:28:23,
Church—Alma the elder and Mosiah die. About 92–91 B.C. 

7
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
1 Now when Mosiah had done this he

8
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
sent out throughout all the land, among

9
00:28:23,0 --> 00:28:23,0
all the people, desiring to know their

10
00:28:23,0 --> 00:27:55,
will concerning who should be their king.

11
00:27:55,0 --> 00:27:55,0
2 And it came to pass that the

12
00:27:55,0 --> 00:27:55,0
voice of the people came, saying:

13
00:27:55,0 --> 00:27:55,0
We are desirous that Aaron thy son

14
00:27:55,0 --> 00:27:27,
should be our king and our ruler.

15
00:27:27,0 --> 00:27:27,0
3 Now Aaron had gone up to the

16
00:27:27,0 --> 00:27:27,0
land of Nephi, therefore the king

17
00:27:27,0 --> 00:27:27,0
could not confer the kingdom

18
00:27:27,0 --> 00:27:27,0
upon him; neither would Aaron take

19
00:27:27,0 --> 00:27:27,0
upon him the kingdom; neither

20
00:27:27,0 --> 00:27:27,0
were any of the sons of Mosiah

21
00:27:27,0 --> 00:26:59,
willing to take upon them the kingdom.

22
00:26:59,0 --> 00:26:59,0
4 Therefore king Mosiah sent

23
00:26:59,0 --> 00:26:59,0
again among the people; yea, even

24
00:26:59,0 --> 00:26:59,0
a written word sent he among

25
00:26:59,0 --> 00:26:59,0
the people. And these were the

26
00:26:59,0 --> 00:26:31,
words that were written, saying:

27
00:26:31,0 --> 00:26:31,0
5 Behold, O ye my people, or

28
00:26:31,0 --> 00:26:31,0
my brethren, for I esteem you

29
00:26:31,0 --> 00:26:31,0
as such, I desire that ye

30
00:26:31,0 --> 00:26:31,0
should consider the cause which

31
00:26:31,0 --> 00:26:31,0
ye are called to

32
00:26:31,0 --> 00:26:17,
consider—for ye are desirous to have a king.

33
00:26:17,0 --> 00:26:17,0
6 Now I declare unto you

34
00:26:17,0 --> 00:26:17,0
that he to whom the

35
00:26:17,0 --> 00:26:17,0
kingdom doth rightly belong

36
00:26:17,0 --> 00:26:17,0
has declined, and will not

37
00:26:17,0 --> 00:27:15,
take upon him the kingdom.

38
00:27:15,0 --> 00:27:15,0
7 And now if there

39
00:27:15,0 --> 00:27:15,0
should be another appointed

40
00:27:15,0 --> 00:27:15,0
in his stead, behold I

41
00:27:15,0 --> 00:27:15,0
fear there would rise

42
00:27:15,0 --> 00:27:15,0
contentions among you.

43
00:27:15,0 --> 00:27:15,0
And who knoweth but

44
00:27:15,0 --> 00:27:15,0
what my son, to whom the

45
00:27:15,0 --> 00:27:15,0
kingdom doth belong,

46
00:27:15,0 --> 00:27:15,0
should turn to be angry

47
00:27:15,0 --> 00:27:15,0
and draw away a part of

48
00:27:15,0 --> 00:27:15,0
this people after him,

49
00:27:15,0 --> 00:27:15,0
which would cause wars

50
00:27:15,0 --> 00:27:15,0
and contentions among

51
00:27:15,0 --> 00:27:15,0
you, which would be the

52
00:27:15,0 --> 00:27:15,0
cause of shedding much

53
00:27:15,0 --> 00:27:15,0
blood and perverting the

54
00:27:15,0 --> 00:27:15,0
way of the Lord, yea,

55
00:27:15,0 --> 00:26:47,
and destroy the souls of many people.

56
00:26:47,0 --> 00:26:47,0
8 Now I say unto you

57
00:26:47,0 --> 00:26:47,0
let us be wise and

58
00:26:47,0 --> 00:26:47,0
consider these things,

59
00:26:47,0 --> 00:26:47,0
for we have no right

60
00:26:47,0 --> 00:26:47,0
to destroy my son,

61
00:26:47,0 --> 00:26:47,0
neither should we have

62
00:26:47,0 --> 00:26:47,0
any right to destroy

63
00:26:47,0 --> 00:26:47,0
another if he should

64
00:26:47,0 --> 00:26:33,
be appointed in his stead.

65
00:26:33,0 --> 00:26:33,0
9 And if my son

66
00:26:33,0 --> 00:26:33,0
should turn again to his

67
00:26:33,0 --> 00:26:33,0
pride and vain

68
00:26:33,0 --> 00:26:33,0
things he would recall

69
00:26:33,0 --> 00:26:33,0
the things which he

70
00:26:33,0 --> 00:26:33,0
had said, and claim

71
00:26:33,0 --> 00:26:33,0
his right to the

72
00:26:33,0 --> 00:26:33,0
kingdom, which would

73
00:26:33,0 --> 00:26:33,0
cause him and also this

74
00:26:33,0 --> 00:28:03,
people to commit much sin.

75
00:28:03,0 --> 00:28:03,0
10 And now let us

76
00:28:03,0 --> 00:28:03,0
be wise and look

77
00:28:03,0 --> 00:28:03,0
forward to these

78
00:28:03,0 --> 00:28:03,0
things, and do that

79
00:28:03,0 --> 00:28:03,0
which will make for the

80
00:28:03,0 --> 00:27:35,
peace of this people.

81
00:27:35,0 --> 00:27:35,0
11 Therefore I

82
00:27:35,0 --> 00:27:35,0
will be your king the

83
00:27:35,0 --> 00:27:35,0
remainder of my

84
00:27:35,0 --> 00:27:35,0
days; nevertheless,

85
00:27:35,0 --> 00:27:35,0
let us appoint

86
00:27:35,0 --> 00:27:35,0
judges, to judge

87
00:27:35,0 --> 00:27:35,0
this people according

88
00:27:35,0 --> 00:27:35,0
to our law; and

89
00:27:35,0 --> 00:27:35,0
we will newly

90
00:27:35,0 --> 00:27:35,0
arrange the affairs of

91
00:27:35,0 --> 00:27:35,0
this people, for

92
00:27:35,0 --> 00:27:35,0
we will appoint

93
00:27:35,0 --> 00:27:35,0
wise men to be

94
00:27:35,0 --> 00:27:35,0
judges, that will judge

95
00:27:35,0 --> 00:27:35,0
this people

96
00:27:35,0 --> 00:29:47,
according to the commandments of God.

97
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
12 Now it is

98
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
better that a man

99
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
should be judged of

100
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
God than of man,

101
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
for the judgments

102
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
of God are

103
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
always just, but the

104
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:47,0
judgments of man

105
00:29:47,0 --> 00:29:19,
are not always just.

106
00:29:19,0 --> 00:29:19,0
13 Therefore, if

107
00:29:19,0 --> 00:29:19,0
it were

108
00:29:19,0 --> 00:29:19,0
possible that you could

109
00:29:19,0 --> 00:29:19,0
have just men

110
00:29:19,0 --> 00:29:19,0
to be your kings,

111
00:29:19,0 --> 00:29:19,0
who would

112
00:29:19,0 --> 00:29:19,0
establish the laws of

113
00:29:19,0 --> 00:29:19,0
God, and judge

114
00:29:19,0 --> 00:29:19,0
this people

115
00:29:19,0 --> 00:29:19,0
according to his

116
00:29:19,0 --> 00:29:19,0
commandments, yea,

117
00:29:19,0 --> 00:29:19,0
if ye could have

118
00:29:19,0 --> 00:29:19,0
men for your

119
00:29:19,0 --> 00:29:19,0
kings who would do

120
00:29:19,0 --> 00:29:19,0
even as my

121
00:29:19,0 --> 00:29:19,0
father Benjamin did

122
00:29:19,0 --> 00:29:19,0
for this

123
00:29:19,0 --> 00:29:19,0
people—I say unto you,

124
00:29:19,0 --> 00:29:19,0
if this could

125
00:29:19,0 --> 00:29:19,0
always be the case

126
00:29:19,0 --> 00:29:19,0
then it would

127
00:29:19,0 --> 00:29:19,0
be expedient that

128
00:29:19,0 --> 00:29:19,0
ye should

129
00:29:19,0 --> 00:34:02,
always have kings to rule over you.

130
00:34:02,0 --> 00:34:02,0
14 And even I

131
00:34:02,0 --> 00:34:02,0
myself have

132
00:34:02,0 --> 00:34:02,0
labored with all

133
00:34:02,0 --> 00:34:02,0
the power and

134
00:34:02,0 --> 00:34:02,0
faculties which I

135
00:34:02,0 --> 00:34:02,0
have possessed,

136
00:34:02,0 --> 00:34:02,0
to teach you

137
00:34:02,0 --> 00:34:02,0
the commandments

138
00:34:02,0 --> 00:34:02,0
of God, and to

139
00:34:02,0 --> 00:34:02,0
establish

140
00:34:02,0 --> 00:34:02,0
peace throughout

141
00:34:02,0 --> 00:34:02,0
the land, that

142
00:34:02,0 --> 00:34:02,0
there should be

143
00:34:02,0 --> 00:34:02,0
no wars nor

144
00:34:02,0 --> 00:34:02,0
contentions, no

145
00:34:02,0 --> 00:34:02,0
stealing, nor

146
00:34:02,0 --> 00:34:02,0
plundering, nor

147
00:34:02,0 --> 00:34:02,0
murdering, nor any

148
00:34:02,0 --> 00:33:34,
manner of iniquity;

149
00:33:34,0 --> 00:33:34,0
15 And

150
00:33:34,0 --> 00:33:34,0
whosoever has

151
00:33:34,0 --> 00:33:34,0
committed iniquity,

152
00:33:34,0 --> 00:33:34,0
him have I

153
00:33:34,0 --> 00:33:34,0
punished according

154
00:33:34,0 --> 00:33:34,0
to the crime

155
00:33:34,0 --> 00:33:34,0
which he has

156
00:33:34,0 --> 00:33:34,0
committed,

157
00:33:34,0 --> 00:33:34,0
according to the

158
00:33:34,0 --> 00:33:34,0
law which has

159
00:33:34,0 --> 00:33:34,0
been given to

160
00:33:34,0 --> 00:38:45,
us by our fathers.

161
00:38:45,0 --> 00:38:45,0
16 Now I say

162
00:38:45,0 --> 00:38:45,0
unto you,

163
00:38:45,0 --> 00:38:45,0
that because all

164
00:38:45,0 --> 00:38:45,0
men are not

165
00:38:45,0 --> 00:38:45,0
just it is

166
00:38:45,0 --> 00:38:45,0
not expedient

167
00:38:45,0 --> 00:38:45,0
that ye should

168
00:38:45,0 --> 00:38:45,0
have a king

169
00:38:45,0 --> 00:38:45,0
or kings to

170
00:38:45,0 --> 00:41:13,
rule over you.

171
00:41:13,0 --> 00:41:13,0
17 For

172
00:41:13,0 --> 00:41:13,0
behold, how much

173
00:41:13,0 --> 00:41:13,0
iniquity

174
00:41:13,0 --> 00:41:13,0
doth one wicked

175
00:41:13,0 --> 00:41:13,0
king cause

176
00:41:13,0 --> 00:41:13,0
to be

177
00:41:13,0 --> 00:41:13,0
committed, yea,

178
00:41:13,0 --> 00:41:13,0
and what great

179
00:41:13,0 --> 00:48:21,
destruction!

180
00:48:21,0 --> 00:48:21,0
18 Yea,

181
00:48:21,0 --> 00:48:21,0
remember king

182
00:48:21,0 --> 00:48:21,0
Noah, his

183
00:48:21,0 --> 00:48:21,0
wickedness

184
00:48:21,0 --> 00:48:21,0
and his

185
00:48:21,0 --> 00:48:21,0
abominations,

186
00:48:21,0 --> 00:48:21,0
and also the

187
00:48:21,0 --> 00:48:21,0
wickedness

188
00:48:21,0 --> 00:48:21,0
and

189
00:48:21,0 --> 00:48:21,0
abominations of

190
00:48:21,0 --> 00:48:21,0
his people.

191
00:48:21,0 --> 00:48:21,0
Behold what

192
00:48:21,0 --> 00:48:21,0
great

193
00:48:21,0 --> 00:48:21,0
destruction did

194
00:48:21,0 --> 00:48:21,0
come upon

195
00:48:21,0 --> 00:48:21,0
them; and

196
00:48:21,0 --> 00:48:21,0
also because

197
00:48:21,0 --> 00:48:21,0
of their

198
00:48:21,0 --> 00:48:21,0
iniquities

199
00:48:21,0 --> 00:48:07,
they were brought into bondage.

200
00:48:07,0 --> 00:48:07,0
19 And

201
00:48:07,0 --> 00:48:07,0
were it not

202
00:48:07,0 --> 00:48:07,0
for the

203
00:48:07,0 --> 00:48:07,0
interposition

204
00:48:07,0 --> 00:48:07,0
of their

205
00:48:07,0 --> 00:48:07,0
all-wise

206
00:48:07,0 --> 00:48:07,0
Creator,

207
00:48:07,0 --> 00:48:07,0
and this

208
00:48:07,0 --> 00:48:07,0
because of

209
00:48:07,0 --> 00:48:07,0
their

210
00:48:07,0 --> 00:48:07,0
sincere

211
00:48:07,0 --> 00:48:07,0
repentance, they

212
00:48:07,0 --> 00:48:07,0
must

213
00:48:07,0 --> 00:48:07,0
unavoidably

214
00:48:07,0 --> 00:49:19,
remain in bondage until now.

215
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
20 But

216
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
behold, he

217
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
did deliver

218
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
them

219
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
because they

220
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
did humble

221
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
themselves

222
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
before

223
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
him; and

224
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
because they

225
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
cried

226
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
mightily unto

227
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
him he did

228
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
deliver

229
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
them out of

230
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
bondage;

231
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
and thus

232
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
doth the

233
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
Lord work

234
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
with his

235
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
power in all

236
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
cases among

237
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
the

238
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
children of

239
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
men,

240
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
extending the arm

241
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
of mercy

242
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
towards

243
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
them that put

244
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
their

245
00:49:19,0 --> 00:50:49,
trust in him.

246
00:50:49,0 --> 00:50:49,0
21 And

247
00:50:49,0 --> 00:50:49,0
behold, now I

248
00:50:49,0 --> 00:50:49,0
say unto

249
00:50:49,0 --> 00:50:49,0
you, ye

250
00:50:49,0 --> 00:50:49,0
cannot

251
00:50:49,0 --> 00:50:49,0
dethrone an

252
00:50:49,0 --> 00:50:49,0
iniquitous

253
00:50:49,0 --> 00:50:49,0
king save it

254
00:50:49,0 --> 00:50:49,0

255
00:50:49,0 --> 00:50:49,0
through much

256
00:50:49,0 --> 00:50:49,0
contention,

257
00:50:49,0 --> 00:50:49,0
and the

258
00:50:49,0 --> 00:50:49,0
shedding of

259
00:50:49,0 --> 01:00:16,
much blood.

260
01:00:16,0 --> 01:00:16,0
22 For

261
01:00:16,0 --> 01:00:16,0
behold, he

262
01:00:16,0 --> 01:00:16,0
has his

263
01:00:16,0 --> 01:00:16,0
friends in

264
01:00:16,0 --> 01:00:16,0


265
01:00:16,0 --> 01:00:16,0
iniquity, and he

266
01:00:16,0 --> 01:00:16,0
keepeth

267
01:00:16,0 --> 01:00:16,0
his guards

268
01:00:16,0 --> 01:00:16,0
about

269
01:00:16,0 --> 01:00:16,0
him; and he

270
01:00:16,0 --> 01:00:16,0
teareth

271
01:00:16,0 --> 01:00:16,0
up the

272
01:00:16,0 --> 01:00:16,0
laws of

273
01:00:16,0 --> 01:00:16,0
those who

274
01:00:16,0 --> 01:00:16,0
have

275
01:00:16,0 --> 01:00:16,0
reigned in

276
01:00:16,0 --> 01:00:16,0
righteousness

277
01:00:16,0 --> 01:00:16,0
before

278
01:00:16,0 --> 01:00:16,0
him; and

279
01:00:16,0 --> 01:00:16,0
he

280
01:00:16,0 --> 01:00:16,0
trampleth under

281
01:00:16,0 --> 01:00:16,0
his feet

282
01:00:16,0 --> 01:04:01,
the commandments of God;

283
01:04:01,0 --> 01:04:01,0
23 And

284
01:04:01,0 --> 01:04:01,0
he

285
01:04:01,0 --> 01:04:01,0
enacteth laws,

286
01:04:01,0 --> 01:04:01,0
and

sendeth

288
01:04:01,0 --> 01:04:01,0
them forth

289
01:04:01,0 --> 01:04:01,0
among

290
01:04:01,0 --> 01:04:01,0
his

291
01:04:01,0 --> 01:04:01,0
people, yea,

292
01:04:01,0 --> 01:04:01,0
laws

293
01:04:01,0 --> 01:04:01,0
after the

294
01:04:01,0 --> 01:04:01,0
manner of

295
01:04:01,0 --> 01:04:01,0
his own

296
01:04:01,0 --> 01:04:01,0


297
01:04:01,0 --> 01:04:01,0
wickedness; and

298
01:04:01,0 --> 01:04:01,0


299
01:04:01,0 --> 01:04:01,0
whosoever doth

300
01:04:01,0 --> 01:04:01,0
not obey

301
01:04:01,0 --> 01:04:01,0
his laws

302
01:04:01,0 --> 01:04:01,0
he

303
01:04:01,0 --> 01:04:01,0
causeth to

304
01:04:01,0 --> 01:04:01,0
be

305
01:04:01,0 --> 01:04:01,0
destroyed; and

306
01:04:01,0 --> 01:04:01,0


307
01:04:01,0 --> 01:04:01,0
whosoever doth

308
01:04:01,0 --> 01:04:01,0
rebel

309
01:04:01,0 --> 01:04:01,0
against

310
01:04:01,0 --> 01:04:01,0
him he

311
01:04:01,0 --> 01:04:01,0
will send

312
01:04:01,0 --> 01:04:01,0
his

313
01:04:01,0 --> 01:04:01,0
armies

314
01:04:01,0 --> 01:04:01,0
against them

315
01:04:01,0 --> 01:04:01,0
to war,

316
01:04:01,0 --> 01:04:01,0
and if he

317
01:04:01,0 --> 01:04:01,0
can he

318
01:04:01,0 --> 01:04:01,0
will

319
01:04:01,0 --> 01:04:01,0
destroy

320
01:04:01,0 --> 01:04:01,0
them; and

321
01:04:01,0 --> 01:04:01,0
thus an

322
01:04:01,0 --> 01:04:01,0


323
01:04:01,0 --> 01:04:01,0
unrighteous king

324
01:04:01,0 --> 01:03:33,
doth pervert the ways of all righteousness.

325
01:03:33,0 --> 01:03:33,0
24 And

326
01:03:33,0 --> 01:03:33,0
now

327
01:03:33,0 --> 01:03:33,0
behold I

328
01:03:33,0 --> 01:03:33,0
say unto

329
01:03:33,0 --> 01:03:33,0
you,

330
01:03:33,0 --> 01:03:33,0
it is

331
01:03:33,0 --> 01:03:33,0
not

332
01:03:33,0 --> 01:03:33,0
expedient

333
01:03:33,0 --> 01:03:33,0
that such

334
01:03:33,0 --> 01:03:33,0


335
01:03:33,0 --> 01:03:33,0
abominations

336
01:03:33,0 --> 01:03:33,0
should

337
01:03:33,0 --> 01:04:03,
come upon you.

338
01:04:03,0 --> 01:04:03,0
25

339
01:04:03,0 --> 01:04:03,0
Therefore,

340
01:04:03,0 --> 01:04:03,0
choose

341
01:04:03,0 --> 01:04:03,0
you by

342
01:04:03,0 --> 01:04:03,0
the

343
01:04:03,0 --> 01:04:03,0
voice of

344
01:04:03,0 --> 01:04:03,0
this

345
01:04:03,0 --> 01:04:03,0
people,

346
01:04:03,0 --> 01:04:03,0
judges,

347
01:04:03,0 --> 01:04:03,0
that ye

348
01:04:03,0 --> 01:04:03,0
may be

349
01:04:03,0 --> 01:04:03,0
judged

350
01:04:03,0 --> 01:04:03,0


351
01:04:03,0 --> 01:04:03,0
according to

352
01:04:03,0 --> 01:04:03,0
the laws

353
01:04:03,0 --> 01:04:03,0
which

354
01:04:03,0 --> 01:04:03,0
have

355
01:04:03,0 --> 01:04:03,0
been

356
01:04:03,0 --> 01:04:03,0
given you

357
01:04:03,0 --> 01:04:03,0
by our

358
01:04:03,0 --> 01:04:03,0
fathers,

359
01:04:03,0 --> 01:04:03,0
which

360
01:04:03,0 --> 01:04:03,0
are

361
01:04:03,0 --> 01:04:03,0
correct,

362
01:04:03,0 --> 01:04:03,0
and

363
01:04:03,0 --> 01:04:03,0
which were

364
01:04:03,0 --> 01:04:03,0
given

365
01:04:03,0 --> 01:04:03,0
them by

366
01:04:03,0 --> 01:04:03,0
the

367
01:04:03,0 --> 01:04:03,0
hand of

368
01:04:03,0 --> 01:03:49,
the Lord.

369
01:03:49,0 --> 01:03:49,0
26 Now

370
01:03:49,0 --> 01:03:49,0
it is

371
01:03:49,0 --> 01:03:49,0
not

372
01:03:49,0 --> 01:03:49,0
common

373
01:03:49,0 --> 01:03:49,0
that

374
01:03:49,0 --> 01:03:49,0
the

375
01:03:49,0 --> 01:03:49,0
voice of

376
01:03:49,0 --> 01:03:49,0
the

377
01:03:49,0 --> 01:03:49,0
people

378
01:03:49,0 --> 01:03:49,0


379
01:03:49,0 --> 01:03:49,0
desireth

380
01:03:49,0 --> 01:03:49,0
anything

381
01:03:49,0 --> 01:03:49,0


382
01:03:49,0 --> 01:03:49,0
contrary to

383
01:03:49,0 --> 01:03:49,0
that

384
01:03:49,0 --> 01:03:49,0
which is

385
01:03:49,0 --> 01:03:49,0


386
01:03:49,0 --> 01:03:49,0
right; but

387
01:03:49,0 --> 01:03:49,0
it is

388
01:03:49,0 --> 01:03:49,0
common

389
01:03:49,0 --> 01:03:49,0
for

390
01:03:49,0 --> 01:03:49,0
the

391
01:03:49,0 --> 01:03:49,0
lesser

392
01:03:49,0 --> 01:03:49,0
part of

393
01:03:49,0 --> 01:03:49,0
the

394
01:03:49,0 --> 01:03:49,0
people

395
01:03:49,0 --> 01:03:49,0
to

396
01:03:49,0 --> 01:03:49,0
desire

397
01:03:49,0 --> 01:03:49,0
that

398
01:03:49,0 --> 01:03:49,0
which is

399
01:03:49,0 --> 01:03:49,0
not

400
01:03:49,0 --> 01:03:49,0
right;

401
01:03:49,0 --> 01:03:49,0


402
01:03:49,0 --> 01:03:49,0
therefore this

403
01:03:49,0 --> 01:03:49,0
shall

404
01:03:49,0 --> 01:03:49,0
ye

405
01:03:49,0 --> 01:03:49,0
observe

406
01:03:49,0 --> 01:03:49,0
and

407
01:03:49,0 --> 01:03:49,0
make it

408
01:03:49,0 --> 01:03:49,0
your

409
01:03:49,0 --> 01:03:49,0
law—to

410
01:03:49,0 --> 01:05:47,
do your business by the voice of the people.

411
01:05:47,0 --> 01:05:47,0
27

412
01:05:47,0 --> 01:05:47,0
And if

413
01:05:47,0 --> 01:05:47,0
the

414
01:05:47,0 --> 01:05:47,0
time

415
01:05:47,0 --> 01:05:47,0
comes

416
01:05:47,0 --> 01:05:47,0
that

417
01:05:47,0 --> 01:05:47,0
the

418
01:05:47,0 --> 01:05:47,0
voice

419
01:05:47,0 --> 01:05:47,0
of

420
01:05:47,0 --> 01:05:47,0
the

421
01:05:47,0 --> 01:05:47,0
people

422
01:05:47,0 --> 01:05:47,0
doth

423
01:05:47,0 --> 01:05:47,0
choose

424
01:05:47,0 --> 01:05:47,0


425
01:05:47,0 --> 01:05:47,0
iniquity,

426
01:05:47,0 --> 01:05:47,0
then

427
01:05:47,0 --> 01:05:47,0
is

428
01:05:47,0 --> 01:05:47,0
the

429
01:05:47,0 --> 01:05:47,0
time

430
01:05:47,0 --> 01:05:47,0
that

431
01:05:47,0 --> 01:05:47,0
the

432
01:05:47,0 --> 01:05:47,0


433
01:05:47,0 --> 01:05:47,0
judgments of

434
01:05:47,0 --> 01:05:47,0
God

435
01:05:47,0 --> 01:05:47,0
will

436
01:05:47,0 --> 01:05:47,0
come

437
01:05:47,0 --> 01:05:47,0
upon

438
01:05:47,0 --> 01:05:47,0
you;

439
01:05:47,0 --> 01:05:47,0
yea,

440
01:05:47,0 --> 01:05:47,0
then

441
01:05:47,0 --> 01:05:47,0
is the

442
01:05:47,0 --> 01:05:47,0
time

443
01:05:47,0 --> 01:05:47,0
he

444
01:05:47,0 --> 01:05:47,0
will

445
01:05:47,0 --> 01:05:47,0
visit

446
01:05:47,0 --> 01:05:47,0
you

447
01:05:47,0 --> 01:05:47,0
with

448
01:05:47,0 --> 01:05:47,0
great

450
01:05:47,0 --> 01:05:47,0


451
01:05:47,0 --> 01:15:28,
destruction even as he has hitherto visited this land.

452
01:15:28,0 --> 01:15:28,0
28

453
01:15:28,0 --> 01:15:28,0
And

454
01:15:28,0 --> 01:15:28,0
now

455
01:15:28,0 --> 01:15:28,0
if ye
