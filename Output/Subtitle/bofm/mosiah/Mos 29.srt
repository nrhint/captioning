00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,167
Chapter 29 Mosiah proposes that judges be chosen

2
00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:02,334
 in place of a king—Unrighteous kings lead their

3
00:00:02,334 --> 00:00:03,501
 people into sin—Alma the younger is chosen chief

4
00:00:03,501 --> 00:00:04,668
 judge by the voice of the people—He is also the high

5
00:00:04,668 --> 00:00:05,835
 priest over the Church—Alma the elder and Mosiah

6
00:00:05,835 --> 00:00:07,002
 die. About 92–91 B.C.

7
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,975
1 Now when Mosiah had done this he sent out

8
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:11,975
 throughout all the land, among all the people, desiring

9
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:13,975
 to know their will concerning who should be their

10
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:15,975
 king

11
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,616
2 And it came to pass that the voice of the people

12
00:00:18,616 --> 00:00:21,283
 came, saying: We are desirous that Aaron thy son

13
00:00:21,283 --> 00:00:23,95
 should be our king and our ruler

14
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,524
3 Now Aaron had gone up to the land of Nephi,

15
00:00:25,524 --> 00:00:27,124
 therefore the king could not confer the kingdom upon

16
00:00:27,124 --> 00:00:28,724
 him; neither would Aaron take upon him the kingdom;

17
00:00:28,724 --> 00:00:30,324
 neither were any of the sons of Mosiah willing to

18
00:00:30,324 --> 00:00:31,924
 take upon them the kingdom

19
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,899
4 Therefore king Mosiah sent again among the

20
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,899
 people; yea, even a written word sent he among the

21
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:37,899
 people. And these were the words that were written,

22
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:39,899
 saying

23
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,873
5 Behold, O ye my people, or my brethren, for I

24
00:00:41,873 --> 00:00:43,873
 esteem you as such, I desire that ye should consider

25
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:45,873
 the cause which ye are called to consider—for ye

26
00:00:45,873 --> 00:00:47,873
 are desirous to have a king

27
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:50,515
6 Now I declare unto you that he to whom the

28
00:00:50,515 --> 00:00:53,182
 kingdom doth rightly belong has declined, and will not

29
00:00:53,182 --> 00:00:55,849
 take upon him the kingdom

30
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:56,711
7 And now if there should be another appointed in

31
00:00:56,711 --> 00:00:57,6
 his stead, behold I fear there would rise

32
00:00:57,6 --> 00:00:58,489
 contentions among you. And who knoweth but what my son, to

33
00:00:58,489 --> 00:00:59,378
 whom the kingdom doth belong, should turn to be

34
00:00:59,378 --> 00:01:00,267
 angry and draw away a part of this people after

35
00:01:00,267 --> 00:01:01,156
 him, which would cause wars and contentions among

36
00:01:01,156 --> 00:01:02,045
 you, which would be the cause of shedding much blood

37
00:01:02,045 --> 00:01:02,934
 and perverting the way of the Lord, yea, and

38
00:01:02,934 --> 00:01:03,823
 destroy the souls of many people

39
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,797
8 Now I say unto you let us be wise and consider

40
00:01:05,797 --> 00:01:07,797
 these things, for we have no right to destroy my

41
00:01:07,797 --> 00:01:09,797
 son, neither should we have any right to destroy

42
00:01:09,797 --> 00:01:11,797
 another if he should be appointed in his stead

43
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:13,372
9 And if my son should turn again to his pride and

44
00:01:13,372 --> 00:01:14,972
 vain things he would recall the things which he

45
00:01:14,972 --> 00:01:16,572
 had said, and claim his right to the kingdom, which

46
00:01:16,572 --> 00:01:18,172
 would cause him and also this people to commit

47
00:01:18,172 --> 00:01:19,772
 much sin

48
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,413
10 And now let us be wise and look forward to

49
00:01:22,413 --> 00:01:25,08
 these things, and do that which will make for the

50
00:01:25,08 --> 00:01:27,747
 peace of this people

51
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:28,864
11 Therefore I will be your king the remainder of

52
00:01:28,864 --> 00:01:30,007
 my days; nevertheless, let us appoint judges, to

53
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:31,15
 judge this people according to our law; and we will

54
00:01:31,15 --> 00:01:32,293
 newly arrange the affairs of this people, for we

55
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:33,436
 will appoint wise men to be judges, that will

56
00:01:33,436 --> 00:01:34,579
 judge this people according to the commandments of

57
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:35,722
 God

58
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,696
12 Now it is better that a man should be judged of

59
00:01:37,696 --> 00:01:39,696
 God than of man, for the judgments of God are

60
00:01:39,696 --> 00:01:41,696
 always just, but the judgments of man are not always

61
00:01:41,696 --> 00:01:43,696
 just

62
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:44,67
13 Therefore, if it were possible that you could

63
00:01:44,67 --> 00:01:45,67
 have just men to be your kings, who would establish

64
00:01:45,67 --> 00:01:46,67
 the laws of God, and judge this people according

65
00:01:46,67 --> 00:01:47,67
 to his commandments, yea, if ye could have men for

66
00:01:47,67 --> 00:01:48,67
 your kings who would do even as my father

67
00:01:48,67 --> 00:01:49,67
 Benjamin did for this people—I say unto you, if this

68
00:01:49,67 --> 00:01:50,67
 could always be the case then it would be expedient

69
00:01:50,67 --> 00:01:51,67
 that ye should always have kings to rule over you

70
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:52,978
14 And even I myself have labored with all the

71
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:54,311
 power and faculties which I have possessed, to teach

72
00:01:54,311 --> 00:01:55,644
 you the commandments of God, and to establish

73
00:01:55,644 --> 00:01:56,977
 peace throughout the land, that there should be no

74
00:01:56,977 --> 00:01:58,31
 wars nor contentions, no stealing, nor plundering,

75
00:01:58,31 --> 00:01:59,643
 nor murdering, nor any manner of iniquity

76
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:01,62
15 And whosoever has committed iniquity, him have

77
00:02:01,62 --> 00:02:03,62
 I punished according to the crime which he has

78
00:02:03,62 --> 00:02:05,62
 committed, according to the law which has been given

79
00:02:05,62 --> 00:02:07,62
 to us by our fathers

80
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:10,261
16 Now I say unto you, that because all men are

81
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:12,928
 not just it is not expedient that ye should have a

82
00:02:12,928 --> 00:02:15,595
 king or kings to rule over you

83
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:18,236
17 For behold, how much iniquity doth one wicked

84
00:02:18,236 --> 00:02:20,903
 king cause to be committed, yea, and what great

85
00:02:20,903 --> 00:02:23,57
 destruction

86
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,143
18 Yea, remember king Noah, his wickedness and his

87
00:02:25,143 --> 00:02:26,743
 abominations, and also the wickedness and

88
00:02:26,743 --> 00:02:28,343
 abominations of his people. Behold what great destruction

89
00:02:28,343 --> 00:02:29,943
 did come upon them; and also because of their

90
00:02:29,943 --> 00:02:31,543
 iniquities they were brought into bondage

91
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,518
19 And were it not for the interposition of their

92
00:02:33,518 --> 00:02:35,518
 all-wise Creator, and this because of their

93
00:02:35,518 --> 00:02:37,518
 sincere repentance, they must unavoidably remain in

94
00:02:37,518 --> 00:02:39,518
 bondage until now

95
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,779
20 But behold, he did deliver them because they

96
00:02:41,779 --> 00:02:44,065
 did humble themselves before him; and because they

97
00:02:44,065 --> 00:02:46,351
 cried mightily unto him he did deliver them out of

98
00:02:46,351 --> 00:02:48,637
 bondage; and thus doth the Lord work with his

99
00:02:48,637 --> 00:02:50,923
 power in all cases among the children of men,

100
00:02:50,923 --> 00:02:53,209
 extending the arm of mercy towards them that put their

101
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:55,495
 trust in him

102
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:58,109
21 And behold, now I say unto you, ye cannot

103
00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:00,776
 dethrone an iniquitous king save it be through much

104
00:03:00,776 --> 00:03:03,443
 contention, and the shedding of much blood

105
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,017
22 For behold, he has his friends in iniquity, and

106
00:03:05,017 --> 00:03:06,617
 he keepeth his guards about him; and he teareth

107
00:03:06,617 --> 00:03:08,217
 up the laws of those who have reigned in

108
00:03:08,217 --> 00:03:09,817
 righteousness before him; and he trampleth under his feet

109
00:03:09,817 --> 00:03:11,417
 the commandments of God

110
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:12,391
23 And he enacteth laws, and sendeth them forth

111
00:03:12,391 --> 00:03:13,391
 among his people, yea, laws after the manner of his

112
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:14,391
 own wickedness; and whosoever doth not obey his

113
00:03:14,391 --> 00:03:15,391
 laws he causeth to be destroyed; and whosoever doth

114
00:03:15,391 --> 00:03:16,391
 rebel against him he will send his armies against

115
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:17,391
 them to war, and if he can he will destroy them;

116
00:03:17,391 --> 00:03:18,391
 and thus an unrighteous king doth pervert the ways

117
00:03:18,391 --> 00:03:19,391
 of all righteousness

118
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:23,366
24 And now behold I say unto you, it is not

119
00:03:23,366 --> 00:03:27,366
 expedient that such abominations should come upon you

120
00:03:27,34 --> 00:03:28,94
25 Therefore, choose you by the voice of this

121
00:03:28,94 --> 00:03:30,54
 people, judges, that ye may be judged according to the

122
00:03:30,54 --> 00:03:32,14
 laws which have been given you by our fathers,

123
00:03:32,14 --> 00:03:33,74
 which are correct, and which were given them by the

124
00:03:33,74 --> 00:03:35,34
 hand of the Lord

125
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:36,648
26 Now it is not common that the voice of the

126
00:03:36,648 --> 00:03:37,981
 people desireth anything contrary to that which is

127
00:03:37,981 --> 00:03:39,314
 right; but it is common for the lesser part of the

128
00:03:39,314 --> 00:03:40,647
 people to desire that which is not right; therefore

129
00:03:40,647 --> 00:03:41,98
 this shall ye observe and make it your law—to do

130
00:03:41,98 --> 00:03:43,313
 your business by the voice of the people

131
00:03:43,29 --> 00:03:44,89
27 And if the time comes that the voice of the

132
00:03:44,89 --> 00:03:46,49
 people doth choose iniquity, then is the time that

133
00:03:46,49 --> 00:03:48,09
 the judgments of God will come upon you; yea, then

134
00:03:48,09 --> 00:03:49,69
 is the time he will visit you with great

135
00:03:49,69 --> 00:03:51,29
 destruction even as he has hitherto visited this land

136
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,264
28 And now if ye have judges, and they do not

137
00:03:53,264 --> 00:03:55,264
 judge you according to the law which has been given,

138
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,264
 ye can cause that they may be judged of a higher

139
00:03:57,264 --> 00:03:59,264
 judge

140
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,839
29 If your higher judges do not judge righteous

141
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:02,439
 judgments, ye shall cause that a small number of

142
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:04,039
 your lower judges should be gathered together, and

143
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,639
 they shall judge your higher judges, according to

144
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:07,239
 the voice of the people

145
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:08,814
30 And I command you to do these things in the

146
00:04:08,814 --> 00:04:10,414
 fear of the Lord; and I command you to do these

147
00:04:10,414 --> 00:04:12,014
 things, and that ye have no king; that if these people

148
00:04:12,014 --> 00:04:13,614
 commit sins and iniquities they shall be answered

149
00:04:13,614 --> 00:04:15,214
 upon their own heads

150
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,188
31 For behold I say unto you, the sins of many

151
00:04:17,188 --> 00:04:19,188
 people have been caused by the iniquities of their

152
00:04:19,188 --> 00:04:21,188
 kings; therefore their iniquities are answered upon

153
00:04:21,188 --> 00:04:23,188
 the heads of their kings

154
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:24,163
32 And now I desire that this inequality should be

155
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:25,163
 no more in this land, especially among this my

156
00:04:25,163 --> 00:04:26,163
 people; but I desire that this land be a land of

157
00:04:26,163 --> 00:04:27,163
 liberty, and every man may enjoy his rights and

158
00:04:27,163 --> 00:04:28,163
 privileges alike, so long as the Lord sees fit that we

159
00:04:28,163 --> 00:04:29,163
 may live and inherit the land, yea, even as long

160
00:04:29,163 --> 00:04:30,163
 as any of our posterity remains upon the face of

161
00:04:30,163 --> 00:04:31,163
 the land

162
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:32,471
33 And many more things did king Mosiah write unto

163
00:04:32,471 --> 00:04:33,804
 them, unfolding unto them all the trials and

164
00:04:33,804 --> 00:04:35,137
 troubles of a righteous king, yea, all the travails of

165
00:04:35,137 --> 00:04:36,47
 soul for their people, and also all the

166
00:04:36,47 --> 00:04:37,803
 murmurings of the people to their king; and he explained it

167
00:04:37,803 --> 00:04:39,136
 all unto them

168
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,779
34 And he told them that these things ought not to

169
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:44,446
 be; but that the burden should come upon all the

170
00:04:44,446 --> 00:04:47,113
 people, that every man might bear his part

171
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,754
35 And he also unfolded unto them all the

172
00:04:49,754 --> 00:04:52,421
 disadvantages they labored under, by having an unrighteous

173
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:55,088
 king to rule over them

174
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,204
36 Yea, all his iniquities and abominations, and

175
00:04:56,204 --> 00:04:57,347
 all the wars, and contentions, and bloodshed, and

176
00:04:57,347 --> 00:04:58,49
 the stealing, and the plundering, and the

177
00:04:58,49 --> 00:04:59,633
 committing of whoredoms, and all manner of iniquities which

178
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:00,776
 cannot be enumerated—telling them that these

179
00:05:00,776 --> 00:05:01,919
 things ought not to be, that they were expressly

180
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,062
 repugnant to the commandments of God

181
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,703
37 And now it came to pass, after king Mosiah had

182
00:05:05,703 --> 00:05:08,37
 sent these things forth among the people they were

183
00:05:08,37 --> 00:05:11,037
 convinced of the truth of his words

184
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:12,411
38 Therefore they relinquished their desires for a

185
00:05:12,411 --> 00:05:13,811
 king, and became exceedingly anxious that every

186
00:05:13,811 --> 00:05:15,211
 man should have an equal chance throughout all the

187
00:05:15,211 --> 00:05:16,611
 land; yea, and every man expressed a willingness

188
00:05:16,611 --> 00:05:18,011
 to answer for his own sins

189
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,128
39 Therefore, it came to pass that they assembled

190
00:05:20,128 --> 00:05:21,271
 themselves together in bodies throughout the land,

191
00:05:21,271 --> 00:05:22,414
 to cast in their voices concerning who should be

192
00:05:22,414 --> 00:05:23,557
 their judges, to judge them according to the law

193
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:24,7
 which had been given them; and they were

194
00:05:24,7 --> 00:05:25,843
 exceedingly rejoiced because of the liberty which had been

195
00:05:25,843 --> 00:05:26,986
 granted unto them

196
00:05:26,96 --> 00:05:27,687
40 And they did wax strong in love towards Mosiah;

197
00:05:27,687 --> 00:05:28,414
 yea, they did esteem him more than any other man;

198
00:05:28,414 --> 00:05:29,141
 for they did not look upon him as a tyrant who

199
00:05:29,141 --> 00:05:29,868
 was seeking for gain, yea, for that lucre which doth

200
00:05:29,868 --> 00:05:30,595
 corrupt the soul; for he had not exacted riches

201
00:05:30,595 --> 00:05:31,322
 of them, neither had he delighted in the shedding

202
00:05:31,322 --> 00:05:32,049
 of blood; but he had established peace in the land,

203
00:05:32,049 --> 00:05:32,776
 and he had granted unto his people that they

204
00:05:32,776 --> 00:05:33,503
 should be delivered from all manner of bondage;

205
00:05:33,503 --> 00:05:34,23
 therefore they did esteem him, yea, exceedingly, beyond

206
00:05:34,23 --> 00:05:34,957
 measure

207
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:36,935
41 And it came to pass that they did appoint

208
00:05:36,935 --> 00:05:38,935
 judges to rule over them, or to judge them according to

209
00:05:38,935 --> 00:05:40,935
 the law; and this they did throughout all the

210
00:05:40,935 --> 00:05:42,935
 land

211
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,509
42 And it came to pass that Alma was appointed to

212
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:46,109
 be the first chief judge, he being also the high

213
00:05:46,109 --> 00:05:47,709
 priest, his father having conferred the office upon

214
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:49,309
 him, and having given him the charge concerning

215
00:05:49,309 --> 00:05:50,909
 all the affairs of the church

216
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:52,884
43 And now it came to pass that Alma did walk in

217
00:05:52,884 --> 00:05:54,884
 the ways of the Lord, and he did keep his

218
00:05:54,884 --> 00:05:56,884
 commandments, and he did judge righteous judgments; and

219
00:05:56,884 --> 00:05:58,884
 there was continual peace through the land

220
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,858
44 And thus commenced the reign of the judges

221
00:06:00,858 --> 00:06:02,858
 throughout all the land of Zarahemla, among all the

222
00:06:02,858 --> 00:06:04,858
 people who were called the Nephites; and Alma was

223
00:06:04,858 --> 00:06:06,858
 the first and chief judge

224
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,5
45 And now it came to pass that his father died,

225
00:06:09,5 --> 00:06:12,167
 being eighty and two years old, having lived to

226
00:06:12,167 --> 00:06:14,834
 fulfil the commandments of God

227
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:16,408
46 And it came to pass that Mosiah died also, in

228
00:06:16,408 --> 00:06:18,008
 the thirty and third year of his reign, being sixty

229
00:06:18,008 --> 00:06:19,608
 and three years old; making in the whole, five

230
00:06:19,608 --> 00:06:21,208
 hundred and nine years from the time Lehi left

231
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:22,808
 Jerusalem

232
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:25,449
47 And thus ended the reign of the kings over the

233
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:28,116
 people of Nephi; and thus ended the days of Alma,

234
00:06:28,116 --> 00:06:30,783
 who was the founder of their church.
