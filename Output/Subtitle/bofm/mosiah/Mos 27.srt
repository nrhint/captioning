00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,0
Chapter 27 Mosiah forbids persecution and enjoins

2
00:00:01,0 --> 00:00:02,0
 equality—Alma the younger and the four sons of

3
00:00:02,0 --> 00:00:03,0
 Mosiah seek to destroy the Church—An angel appears

4
00:00:03,0 --> 00:00:04,0
 and commands them to cease their evil course—Alma is

5
00:00:04,0 --> 00:00:05,0
 struck dumb—All mankind must be born again to

6
00:00:05,0 --> 00:00:06,0
 gain salvation—Alma and the sons of Mosiah declare

7
00:00:06,0 --> 00:00:07,0
 glad tidings. About 100–92 B.C.

8
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,118
1 And now it came to pass that the persecutions

9
00:00:09,118 --> 00:00:10,261
 which were inflicted on the church by the

10
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:11,404
 unbelievers became so great that the church began to murmur,

11
00:00:11,404 --> 00:00:12,547
 and complain to their leaders concerning the

12
00:00:12,547 --> 00:00:13,69
 matter; and they did complain to Alma. And Alma laid

13
00:00:13,69 --> 00:00:14,833
 the case before their king, Mosiah. And Mosiah

14
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:15,976
 consulted with his priests

15
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:21,949
2 And it came to pass that king Mosiah sent a

16
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:27,949
 proclamation throughout the land round about that

17
00:00:27,949 --> 00:00:33,949
 there should not any unbeliever persecute any of those

18
00:00:33,949 --> 00:00:39,949
 who belonged to the church of God

19
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,873
3 And there was a strict command throughout all

20
00:00:41,873 --> 00:00:43,873
 the churches that there should be no persecutions

21
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:45,873
 among them, that there should be an equality among

22
00:00:45,873 --> 00:00:47,873
 all men

23
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,848
4 That they should let no pride nor haughtiness

24
00:00:49,848 --> 00:00:51,848
 disturb their peace; that every man should esteem

25
00:00:51,848 --> 00:00:53,848
 his neighbor as himself, laboring with their own

26
00:00:53,848 --> 00:00:55,848
 hands for their support

27
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,422
5 Yea, and all their priests and teachers should

28
00:00:57,422 --> 00:00:59,022
 labor with their own hands for their support, in

29
00:00:59,022 --> 00:01:00,622
 all cases save it were in sickness, or in much want;

30
00:01:00,622 --> 00:01:02,222
 and doing these things, they did abound in the

31
00:01:02,222 --> 00:01:03,822
 grace of God

32
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,13
6 And there began to be much peace again in the

33
00:01:05,13 --> 00:01:06,463
 land; and the people began to be very numerous, and

34
00:01:06,463 --> 00:01:07,796
 began to scatter abroad upon the face of the

35
00:01:07,796 --> 00:01:09,129
 earth, yea, on the north and on the south, on the east

36
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:10,462
 and on the west, building large cities and

37
00:01:10,462 --> 00:01:11,795
 villages in all quarters of the land

38
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:15,772
7 And the Lord did visit them and prosper them,

39
00:01:15,772 --> 00:01:19,772
 and they became a large and wealthy people

40
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:20,746
8 Now the sons of Mosiah were numbered among the

41
00:01:20,746 --> 00:01:21,746
 unbelievers; and also one of the sons of Alma was

42
00:01:21,746 --> 00:01:22,746
 numbered among them, he being called Alma, after

43
00:01:22,746 --> 00:01:23,746
 his father; nevertheless, he became a very wicked

44
00:01:23,746 --> 00:01:24,746
 and an idolatrous man. And he was a man of many

45
00:01:24,746 --> 00:01:25,746
 words, and did speak much flattery to the people;

46
00:01:25,746 --> 00:01:26,746
 therefore he led many of the people to do after the

47
00:01:26,746 --> 00:01:27,746
 manner of his iniquities

48
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:29,321
9 And he became a great hinderment to the

49
00:01:29,321 --> 00:01:30,921
 prosperity of the church of God; stealing away the hearts

50
00:01:30,921 --> 00:01:32,521
 of the people; causing much dissension among the

51
00:01:32,521 --> 00:01:34,121
 people; giving a chance for the enemy of God to

52
00:01:34,121 --> 00:01:35,721
 exercise his power over them

53
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,029
10 And now it came to pass that while he was going

54
00:01:37,029 --> 00:01:38,362
 about to destroy the church of God, for he did go

55
00:01:38,362 --> 00:01:39,695
 about secretly with the sons of Mosiah seeking to

56
00:01:39,695 --> 00:01:41,028
 destroy the church, and to lead astray the people

57
00:01:41,028 --> 00:01:42,361
 of the Lord, contrary to the commandments of God,

58
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:43,694
 or even the king

59
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:45,003
11 And as I said unto you, as they were going

60
00:01:45,003 --> 00:01:46,336
 about rebelling against God, behold, the angel of the

61
00:01:46,336 --> 00:01:47,669
 Lord appeared unto them; and he descended as it

62
00:01:47,669 --> 00:01:49,002
 were in a cloud; and he spake as it were with a

63
00:01:49,002 --> 00:01:50,335
 voice of thunder, which caused the earth to shake upon

64
00:01:50,335 --> 00:01:51,668
 which they stood

65
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:54,312
12 And so great was their astonishment, that they

66
00:01:54,312 --> 00:01:56,979
 fell to the earth, and understood not the words

67
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:59,646
 which he spake unto them

68
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:00,953
13 Nevertheless he cried again, saying: Alma,

69
00:02:00,953 --> 00:02:02,285
 arise and stand forth, for why persecutest thou the

70
00:02:02,285 --> 00:02:03,618
 church of God? For the Lord hath said: This is my

71
00:02:03,618 --> 00:02:04,951
 church, and I will establish it; and nothing shall

72
00:02:04,951 --> 00:02:06,285
 overthrow it, save it is the transgression of my

73
00:02:06,285 --> 00:02:07,618
 people

74
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:08,483
14 And again, the angel said: Behold, the Lord

75
00:02:08,483 --> 00:02:09,372
 hath heard the prayers of his people, and also the

76
00:02:09,372 --> 00:02:10,261
 prayers of his servant, Alma, who is thy father; for

77
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:11,15
 he has prayed with much faith concerning thee

78
00:02:11,15 --> 00:02:12,039
 that thou mightest be brought to the knowledge of the

79
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:12,928
 truth; therefore, for this purpose have I come to

80
00:02:12,928 --> 00:02:13,817
 convince thee of the power and authority of God,

81
00:02:13,817 --> 00:02:14,706
 that the prayers of his servants might be answered

82
00:02:14,706 --> 00:02:15,595
 according to their faith

83
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:17,569
15 And now behold, can ye dispute the power of

84
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:19,569
 God? For behold, doth not my voice shake the earth?

85
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:21,569
 And can ye not also behold me before you? And I am

86
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:23,569
 sent from God

87
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:24,543
16 Now I say unto thee: Go, and remember the

88
00:02:24,543 --> 00:02:25,543
 captivity of thy fathers in the land of Helam, and in

89
00:02:25,543 --> 00:02:26,543
 the land of Nephi; and remember how great things he

90
00:02:26,543 --> 00:02:27,543
 has done for them; for they were in bondage, and

91
00:02:27,543 --> 00:02:28,543
 he has delivered them. And now I say unto thee,

92
00:02:28,543 --> 00:02:29,543
 Alma, go thy way, and seek to destroy the church no

93
00:02:29,543 --> 00:02:30,543
 more, that their prayers may be answered, and this

94
00:02:30,543 --> 00:02:31,543
 even if thou wilt of thyself be cast off

95
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:34,185
17 And now it came to pass that these were the

96
00:02:34,185 --> 00:02:36,852
 last words which the angel spake unto Alma, and he

97
00:02:36,852 --> 00:02:39,519
 departed

98
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:40,493
18 And now Alma and those that were with him fell

99
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,493
 again to the earth, for great was their

100
00:02:41,493 --> 00:02:42,493
 astonishment; for with their own eyes they had beheld an

101
00:02:42,493 --> 00:02:43,493
 angel of the Lord; and his voice was as thunder,

102
00:02:43,493 --> 00:02:44,493
 which shook the earth; and they knew that there was

103
00:02:44,493 --> 00:02:45,493
 nothing save the power of God that could shake the

104
00:02:45,493 --> 00:02:46,493
 earth and cause it to tremble as though it would

105
00:02:46,493 --> 00:02:47,493
 part asunder

106
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:48,8
19 And now the astonishment of Alma was so great

107
00:02:48,8 --> 00:02:50,133
 that he became dumb, that he could not open his

108
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:51,466
 mouth; yea, and he became weak, even that he could

109
00:02:51,466 --> 00:02:52,799
 not move his hands; therefore he was taken by those

110
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:54,132
 that were with him, and carried helpless, even

111
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,465
 until he was laid before his father

112
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:58,109
20 And they rehearsed unto his father all that had

113
00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:00,776
 happened unto them; and his father rejoiced, for

114
00:03:00,776 --> 00:03:03,443
 he knew that it was the power of God

115
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,417
21 And he caused that a multitude should be

116
00:03:05,417 --> 00:03:07,417
 gathered together that they might witness what the Lord

117
00:03:07,417 --> 00:03:09,417
 had done for his son, and also for those that were

118
00:03:09,417 --> 00:03:11,417
 with him

119
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:12,534
22 And he caused that the priests should assemble

120
00:03:12,534 --> 00:03:13,677
 themselves together; and they began to fast, and

121
00:03:13,677 --> 00:03:14,82
 to pray to the Lord their God that he would open

122
00:03:14,82 --> 00:03:15,963
 the mouth of Alma, that he might speak, and also

123
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:17,106
 that his limbs might receive their strength—that the

124
00:03:17,106 --> 00:03:18,249
 eyes of the people might be opened to see and know

125
00:03:18,249 --> 00:03:19,392
 of the goodness and glory of God

126
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,966
23 And it came to pass after they had fasted and

127
00:03:20,966 --> 00:03:22,566
 prayed for the space of two days and two nights,

128
00:03:22,566 --> 00:03:24,166
 the limbs of Alma received their strength, and he

129
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,766
 stood up and began to speak unto them, bidding them

130
00:03:25,766 --> 00:03:27,366
 to be of good comfort

131
00:03:27,34 --> 00:03:30,007
24 For, said he, I have repented of my sins, and

132
00:03:30,007 --> 00:03:32,674
 have been redeemed of the Lord; behold I am born of

133
00:03:32,674 --> 00:03:35,341
 the Spirit

134
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:36,648
25 And the Lord said unto me: Marvel not that all

135
00:03:36,648 --> 00:03:37,981
 mankind, yea, men and women, all nations,

136
00:03:37,981 --> 00:03:39,314
 kindreds, tongues and people, must be born again; yea,

137
00:03:39,314 --> 00:03:40,647
 born of God, changed from their carnal and fallen

138
00:03:40,647 --> 00:03:41,98
 state, to a state of righteousness, being redeemed of

139
00:03:41,98 --> 00:03:43,313
 God, becoming his sons and daughters

140
00:03:43,29 --> 00:03:45,957
26 And thus they become new creatures; and unless

141
00:03:45,957 --> 00:03:48,624
 they do this, they can in nowise inherit the

142
00:03:48,624 --> 00:03:51,291
 kingdom of God

143
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,931
27 I say unto you, unless this be the case, they

144
00:03:53,931 --> 00:03:56,598
 must be cast off; and this I know, because I was

145
00:03:56,598 --> 00:03:59,265
 like to be cast off

146
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,239
28 Nevertheless, after wading through much

147
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:03,239
 tribulation, repenting nigh unto death, the Lord in mercy

148
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,239
 hath seen fit to snatch me out of an everlasting

149
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:07,239
 burning, and I am born of God

150
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:08,814
29 My soul hath been redeemed from the gall of

151
00:04:08,814 --> 00:04:10,414
 bitterness and bonds of iniquity. I was in the

152
00:04:10,414 --> 00:04:12,014
 darkest abyss; but now I behold the marvelous light of

153
00:04:12,014 --> 00:04:13,614
 God. My soul was racked with eternal torment; but I

154
00:04:13,614 --> 00:04:15,214
 am snatched, and my soul is pained no more

155
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,788
30 I rejected my Redeemer, and denied that which

156
00:04:16,788 --> 00:04:18,388
 had been spoken of by our fathers; but now that

157
00:04:18,388 --> 00:04:19,988
 they may foresee that he will come, and that he

158
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:21,588
 remembereth every creature of his creating, he will

159
00:04:21,588 --> 00:04:23,188
 make himself manifest unto all

160
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:24,163
31 Yea, every knee shall bow, and every tongue

161
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:25,163
 confess before him. Yea, even at the last day, when

162
00:04:25,163 --> 00:04:26,163
 all men shall stand to be judged of him, then shall

163
00:04:26,163 --> 00:04:27,163
 they confess that he is God; then shall they

164
00:04:27,163 --> 00:04:28,163
 confess, who live without God in the world, that the

165
00:04:28,163 --> 00:04:29,163
 judgment of an everlasting punishment is just upon

166
00:04:29,163 --> 00:04:30,163
 them; and they shall quake, and tremble, and

167
00:04:30,163 --> 00:04:31,163
 shrink beneath the glance of his all-searching eye

168
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:32,027
32 And now it came to pass that Alma began from

169
00:04:32,027 --> 00:04:32,916
 this time forward to teach the people, and those who

170
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:33,805
 were with Alma at the time the angel appeared

171
00:04:33,805 --> 00:04:34,694
 unto them, traveling round about through all the

172
00:04:34,694 --> 00:04:35,583
 land, publishing to all the people the things which

173
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:36,472
 they had heard and seen, and preaching the word of

174
00:04:36,472 --> 00:04:37,361
 God in much tribulation, being greatly persecuted

175
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:38,25
 by those who were unbelievers, being smitten by

176
00:04:38,25 --> 00:04:39,139
 many of them

177
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,112
33 But notwithstanding all this, they did impart

178
00:04:41,112 --> 00:04:43,112
 much consolation to the church, confirming their

179
00:04:43,112 --> 00:04:45,112
 faith, and exhorting them with long-suffering and

180
00:04:45,112 --> 00:04:47,112
 much travail to keep the commandments of God

181
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,754
34 And four of them were the sons of Mosiah; and

182
00:04:49,754 --> 00:04:52,421
 their names were Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner, and

183
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:55,088
 Himni; these were the names of the sons of Mosiah

184
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,061
35 And they traveled throughout all the land of

185
00:04:56,061 --> 00:04:57,061
 Zarahemla, and among all the people who were under

186
00:04:57,061 --> 00:04:58,061
 the reign of king Mosiah, zealously striving to

187
00:04:58,061 --> 00:04:59,061
 repair all the injuries which they had done to the

188
00:04:59,061 --> 00:05:00,061
 church, confessing all their sins, and publishing

189
00:05:00,061 --> 00:05:01,061
 all the things which they had seen, and explaining

190
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:02,061
 the prophecies and the scriptures to all who

191
00:05:02,061 --> 00:05:03,061
 desired to hear them

192
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,703
36 And thus they were instruments in the hands of

193
00:05:05,703 --> 00:05:08,37
 God in bringing many to the knowledge of the

194
00:05:08,37 --> 00:05:11,037
 truth, yea, to the knowledge of their Redeemer

195
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:12,761
37 And how blessed are they! For they did publish

196
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:14,511
 peace; they did publish good tidings of good; and

197
00:05:14,511 --> 00:05:16,261
 they did declare unto the people that the Lord

198
00:05:16,261 --> 00:05:18,011
 reigneth.
