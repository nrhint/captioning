1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 27 Mosiah forbids persecution and

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
enjoins equality—Alma the younger and the four sons

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of Mosiah seek to destroy the Church—An angel

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
appears and commands them to cease their evil

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
course—Alma is struck dumb—All mankind must be

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
born again to gain salvation—Alma and the sons of

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:06:27,
Mosiah declare glad tidings. About 100–92 B.C. 

8
00:06:27,0 --> 00:06:27,0
1 And now it came to pass that the

9
00:06:27,0 --> 00:06:27,0
persecutions which were inflicted on the church by the

10
00:06:27,0 --> 00:06:27,0
unbelievers became so great that the church

11
00:06:27,0 --> 00:06:27,0
began to murmur, and complain to their leaders

12
00:06:27,0 --> 00:06:27,0
concerning the matter; and they did complain to

13
00:06:27,0 --> 00:06:27,0
Alma. And Alma laid the case before their king,

14
00:06:27,0 --> 00:10:11,
Mosiah. And Mosiah consulted with his priests.

15
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
2 And it came to pass that king

16
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
Mosiah sent a proclamation throughout the

17
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
land round about that there should

18
00:10:11,0 --> 00:10:11,0
not any unbeliever persecute any of

19
00:10:11,0 --> 00:15:53,
those who belonged to the church of God.

20
00:15:53,0 --> 00:15:53,0
3 And there was a strict

21
00:15:53,0 --> 00:15:53,0
command throughout all the churches

22
00:15:53,0 --> 00:15:53,0
that there should be no

23
00:15:53,0 --> 00:15:53,0
persecutions among them, that there

24
00:15:53,0 --> 00:20:50,
should be an equality among all men;

25
00:20:50,0 --> 00:20:50,0
4 That they should let no

26
00:20:50,0 --> 00:20:50,0
pride nor haughtiness disturb

27
00:20:50,0 --> 00:20:50,0
their peace; that every man

28
00:20:50,0 --> 00:20:50,0
should esteem his neighbor

29
00:20:50,0 --> 00:20:50,0
as himself, laboring with

30
00:20:50,0 --> 00:25:02,
their own hands for their support.

31
00:25:02,0 --> 00:25:02,0
5 Yea, and all their

32
00:25:02,0 --> 00:25:02,0
priests and teachers should

33
00:25:02,0 --> 00:25:02,0
labor with their own hands

34
00:25:02,0 --> 00:25:02,0
for their support, in all

35
00:25:02,0 --> 00:25:02,0
cases save it were in

36
00:25:02,0 --> 00:25:02,0
sickness, or in much want; and

37
00:25:02,0 --> 00:25:02,0
doing these things, they

38
00:25:02,0 --> 00:27:14,
did abound in the grace of God.

39
00:27:14,0 --> 00:27:14,0
6 And there began to be

40
00:27:14,0 --> 00:27:14,0
much peace again in the

41
00:27:14,0 --> 00:27:14,0
land; and the people began

42
00:27:14,0 --> 00:27:14,0
to be very numerous, and

43
00:27:14,0 --> 00:27:14,0
began to scatter abroad

44
00:27:14,0 --> 00:27:14,0
upon the face of the

45
00:27:14,0 --> 00:27:14,0
earth, yea, on the north and

46
00:27:14,0 --> 00:27:14,0
on the south, on the east

47
00:27:14,0 --> 00:27:14,0
and on the west, building

48
00:27:14,0 --> 00:27:14,0
large cities and

49
00:27:14,0 --> 00:32:25,
villages in all quarters of the land.

50
00:32:25,0 --> 00:32:25,0
7 And the Lord did

51
00:32:25,0 --> 00:32:25,0
visit them and prosper

52
00:32:25,0 --> 00:32:25,0
them, and they became a

53
00:32:25,0 --> 00:31:57,
large and wealthy people.

54
00:31:57,0 --> 00:31:57,0
8 Now the sons of

55
00:31:57,0 --> 00:31:57,0
Mosiah were numbered

56
00:31:57,0 --> 00:31:57,0
among the unbelievers;

57
00:31:57,0 --> 00:31:57,0
and also one of the

58
00:31:57,0 --> 00:31:57,0
sons of Alma was

59
00:31:57,0 --> 00:31:57,0
numbered among them, he

60
00:31:57,0 --> 00:31:57,0
being called Alma, after

61
00:31:57,0 --> 00:31:57,0
his father;

62
00:31:57,0 --> 00:31:57,0
nevertheless, he became a

63
00:31:57,0 --> 00:31:57,0
very wicked and an

64
00:31:57,0 --> 00:31:57,0
idolatrous man. And he was

65
00:31:57,0 --> 00:31:57,0
a man of many words,

66
00:31:57,0 --> 00:31:57,0
and did speak much

67
00:31:57,0 --> 00:31:57,0
flattery to the

68
00:31:57,0 --> 00:31:57,0
people; therefore he led

69
00:31:57,0 --> 00:31:57,0
many of the people to

70
00:31:57,0 --> 00:34:09,
do after the manner of his iniquities.

71
00:34:09,0 --> 00:34:09,0
9 And he became a

72
00:34:09,0 --> 00:34:09,0
great hinderment to

73
00:34:09,0 --> 00:34:09,0
the prosperity of the

74
00:34:09,0 --> 00:34:09,0
church of God;

75
00:34:09,0 --> 00:34:09,0
stealing away the hearts

76
00:34:09,0 --> 00:34:09,0
of the people;

77
00:34:09,0 --> 00:34:09,0
causing much dissension

78
00:34:09,0 --> 00:34:09,0
among the people;

79
00:34:09,0 --> 00:34:09,0
giving a chance for the

80
00:34:09,0 --> 00:34:09,0
enemy of God to

81
00:34:09,0 --> 00:36:21,
exercise his power over them.

82
00:36:21,0 --> 00:36:21,0
10 And now it came

83
00:36:21,0 --> 00:36:21,0
to pass that while

84
00:36:21,0 --> 00:36:21,0
he was going about

85
00:36:21,0 --> 00:36:21,0
to destroy the

86
00:36:21,0 --> 00:36:21,0
church of God, for he

87
00:36:21,0 --> 00:36:21,0
did go about

88
00:36:21,0 --> 00:36:21,0
secretly with the sons of

89
00:36:21,0 --> 00:36:21,0
Mosiah seeking to

90
00:36:21,0 --> 00:36:21,0
destroy the church,

91
00:36:21,0 --> 00:36:21,0
and to lead astray

92
00:36:21,0 --> 00:36:21,0
the people of the

93
00:36:21,0 --> 00:36:21,0
Lord, contrary to

94
00:36:21,0 --> 00:36:21,0
the commandments of

95
00:36:21,0 --> 00:47:49,
God, or even the king—

96
00:47:49,0 --> 00:47:49,0
11 And as I said

97
00:47:49,0 --> 00:47:49,0
unto you, as they

98
00:47:49,0 --> 00:47:49,0
were going about

99
00:47:49,0 --> 00:47:49,0
rebelling

100
00:47:49,0 --> 00:47:49,0
against God, behold,

101
00:47:49,0 --> 00:47:49,0
the angel of the

102
00:47:49,0 --> 00:47:49,0
Lord appeared unto

103
00:47:49,0 --> 00:47:49,0
them; and he

104
00:47:49,0 --> 00:47:49,0
descended as it were

105
00:47:49,0 --> 00:47:49,0
in a cloud; and

106
00:47:49,0 --> 00:47:49,0
he spake as it

107
00:47:49,0 --> 00:47:49,0
were with a voice of

108
00:47:49,0 --> 00:47:49,0
thunder, which

109
00:47:49,0 --> 00:47:49,0
caused the earth

110
00:47:49,0 --> 00:52:18,
to shake upon which they stood;

111
00:52:18,0 --> 00:52:18,0
12 And so great

112
00:52:18,0 --> 00:52:18,0
was their

113
00:52:18,0 --> 00:52:18,0
astonishment, that

114
00:52:18,0 --> 00:52:18,0
they fell to

115
00:52:18,0 --> 00:52:18,0
the earth, and

116
00:52:18,0 --> 00:52:18,0
understood not

117
00:52:18,0 --> 00:52:18,0
the words which

118
00:52:18,0 --> 00:53:16,
he spake unto them.

119
00:53:16,0 --> 00:53:16,0
13 Nevertheless

120
00:53:16,0 --> 00:53:16,0
he cried

121
00:53:16,0 --> 00:53:16,0
again, saying: Alma,

122
00:53:16,0 --> 00:53:16,0
arise and

123
00:53:16,0 --> 00:53:16,0
stand forth, for

124
00:53:16,0 --> 00:53:16,0
why persecutest

125
00:53:16,0 --> 00:53:16,0
thou the church

126
00:53:16,0 --> 00:53:16,0
of God? For the

127
00:53:16,0 --> 00:53:16,0
Lord hath

128
00:53:16,0 --> 00:53:16,0
said: This is my

129
00:53:16,0 --> 00:53:16,0
church, and I

130
00:53:16,0 --> 00:53:16,0
will establish it;

131
00:53:16,0 --> 00:53:16,0
and nothing

132
00:53:16,0 --> 00:53:16,0
shall overthrow

133
00:53:16,0 --> 00:53:16,0
it, save it is

134
00:53:16,0 --> 00:53:16,0
the

135
00:53:16,0 --> 00:52:48,
transgression of my people.

136
00:52:48,0 --> 00:52:48,0
14 And again,

137
00:52:48,0 --> 00:52:48,0
the angel

138
00:52:48,0 --> 00:52:48,0
said: Behold, the

139
00:52:48,0 --> 00:52:48,0
Lord hath

140
00:52:48,0 --> 00:52:48,0
heard the prayers

141
00:52:48,0 --> 00:52:48,0
of his people,

142
00:52:48,0 --> 00:52:48,0
and also the

143
00:52:48,0 --> 00:52:48,0
prayers of his

144
00:52:48,0 --> 00:52:48,0
servant,

145
00:52:48,0 --> 00:52:48,0
Alma, who is thy

146
00:52:48,0 --> 00:52:48,0
father; for he

147
00:52:48,0 --> 00:52:48,0
has prayed

148
00:52:48,0 --> 00:52:48,0
with much faith

149
00:52:48,0 --> 00:52:48,0
concerning thee

150
00:52:48,0 --> 00:52:48,0
that thou

151
00:52:48,0 --> 00:52:48,0
mightest be

152
00:52:48,0 --> 00:52:48,0
brought to the

153
00:52:48,0 --> 00:52:48,0
knowledge of the

154
00:52:48,0 --> 00:52:48,0
truth;

155
00:52:48,0 --> 00:52:48,0
therefore, for this

156
00:52:48,0 --> 00:52:48,0
purpose have I

157
00:52:48,0 --> 00:52:48,0
come to

158
00:52:48,0 --> 00:52:48,0
convince thee of the

159
00:52:48,0 --> 00:52:48,0
power and

160
00:52:48,0 --> 00:52:48,0
authority of God,

161
00:52:48,0 --> 00:52:48,0
that the

162
00:52:48,0 --> 00:52:48,0
prayers of his

163
00:52:48,0 --> 00:52:48,0
servants might be

164
00:52:48,0 --> 00:52:34,
answered according to their faith.

165
00:52:34,0 --> 00:52:34,0
15 And now

166
00:52:34,0 --> 00:52:34,0
behold, can ye

167
00:52:34,0 --> 00:52:34,0
dispute the

168
00:52:34,0 --> 00:52:34,0
power of God?

169
00:52:34,0 --> 00:52:34,0
For behold,

170
00:52:34,0 --> 00:52:34,0
doth not my

171
00:52:34,0 --> 00:52:34,0
voice shake the

172
00:52:34,0 --> 00:52:34,0
earth? And

173
00:52:34,0 --> 00:52:34,0
can ye not

174
00:52:34,0 --> 00:52:34,0
also behold me

175
00:52:34,0 --> 00:52:34,0
before you?

176
00:52:34,0 --> 00:52:20,
And I am sent from God.

177
00:52:20,0 --> 00:52:20,0
16 Now I say

178
00:52:20,0 --> 00:52:20,0
unto thee:

179
00:52:20,0 --> 00:52:20,0
Go, and

180
00:52:20,0 --> 00:52:20,0
remember the

181
00:52:20,0 --> 00:52:20,0
captivity of

182
00:52:20,0 --> 00:52:20,0
thy fathers in

183
00:52:20,0 --> 00:52:20,0
the land of

184
00:52:20,0 --> 00:52:20,0
Helam, and

185
00:52:20,0 --> 00:52:20,0
in the land

186
00:52:20,0 --> 00:52:20,0
of Nephi;

187
00:52:20,0 --> 00:52:20,0
and remember

188
00:52:20,0 --> 00:52:20,0
how great

189
00:52:20,0 --> 00:52:20,0
things he has

190
00:52:20,0 --> 00:52:20,0
done for

191
00:52:20,0 --> 00:52:20,0
them; for they

192
00:52:20,0 --> 00:52:20,0
were in

193
00:52:20,0 --> 00:52:20,0
bondage, and he

194
00:52:20,0 --> 00:52:20,0
has delivered

195
00:52:20,0 --> 00:52:20,0
them. And

196
00:52:20,0 --> 00:52:20,0
now I say

197
00:52:20,0 --> 00:52:20,0
unto thee,

198
00:52:20,0 --> 00:52:20,0
Alma, go thy

199
00:52:20,0 --> 00:52:20,0
way, and seek

200
00:52:20,0 --> 00:52:20,0
to destroy

201
00:52:20,0 --> 00:52:20,0
the church no

202
00:52:20,0 --> 00:52:20,0
more, that

203
00:52:20,0 --> 00:52:20,0
their prayers

204
00:52:20,0 --> 00:52:20,0
may be

205
00:52:20,0 --> 00:52:20,0
answered, and

206
00:52:20,0 --> 00:52:20,0
this even if

207
00:52:20,0 --> 00:54:04,
thou wilt of thyself be cast off.

208
00:54:04,0 --> 00:54:04,0
17 And now

209
00:54:04,0 --> 00:54:04,0
it came to

210
00:54:04,0 --> 00:54:04,0
pass that

211
00:54:04,0 --> 00:54:04,0
these were

212
00:54:04,0 --> 00:54:04,0
the last

213
00:54:04,0 --> 00:54:04,0
words which

214
00:54:04,0 --> 00:54:04,0
the angel

215
00:54:04,0 --> 00:54:04,0
spake unto

216
00:54:04,0 --> 00:53:36,
Alma, and he departed.

217
00:53:36,0 --> 00:53:36,0
18 And now

218
00:53:36,0 --> 00:53:36,0
Alma and

219
00:53:36,0 --> 00:53:36,0
those that

220
00:53:36,0 --> 00:53:36,0
were with

221
00:53:36,0 --> 00:53:36,0
him fell

222
00:53:36,0 --> 00:53:36,0
again to

223
00:53:36,0 --> 00:53:36,0
the earth,

224
00:53:36,0 --> 00:53:36,0
for great

225
00:53:36,0 --> 00:53:36,0
was their

226
00:53:36,0 --> 00:53:36,0


227
00:53:36,0 --> 00:53:36,0
astonishment; for

228
00:53:36,0 --> 00:53:36,0
with their

229
00:53:36,0 --> 00:53:36,0
own eyes

230
00:53:36,0 --> 00:53:36,0
they had

231
00:53:36,0 --> 00:53:36,0
beheld an

232
00:53:36,0 --> 00:53:36,0
angel of the

233
00:53:36,0 --> 00:53:36,0
Lord; and

234
00:53:36,0 --> 00:53:36,0
his voice

235
00:53:36,0 --> 00:53:36,0
was as

236
00:53:36,0 --> 00:53:36,0
thunder,

237
00:53:36,0 --> 00:53:36,0
which shook

238
00:53:36,0 --> 00:53:36,0
the earth;

239
00:53:36,0 --> 00:53:36,0
and they

240
00:53:36,0 --> 00:53:36,0
knew that

241
00:53:36,0 --> 00:53:36,0
there was

242
00:53:36,0 --> 00:53:36,0
nothing save

243
00:53:36,0 --> 00:53:36,0
the power

244
00:53:36,0 --> 00:53:36,0
of God

245
00:53:36,0 --> 00:53:36,0
that could

246
00:53:36,0 --> 00:53:36,0
shake the

247
00:53:36,0 --> 00:53:36,0
earth and

248
00:53:36,0 --> 00:53:36,0
cause it to

249
00:53:36,0 --> 00:55:34,
tremble as though it would part asunder.

250
00:55:34,0 --> 00:55:34,0
19 And

251
00:55:34,0 --> 00:55:34,0
now the

252
00:55:34,0 --> 00:55:34,0
astonishment

253
00:55:34,0 --> 00:55:34,0
of Alma

254
00:55:34,0 --> 00:55:34,0
was so

255
00:55:34,0 --> 00:55:34,0
great that

256
00:55:34,0 --> 00:55:34,0
he became

257
00:55:34,0 --> 00:55:34,0
dumb,

258
00:55:34,0 --> 00:55:34,0
that he

259
00:55:34,0 --> 00:55:34,0
could not

260
00:55:34,0 --> 00:55:34,0
open his

261
00:55:34,0 --> 00:55:34,0
mouth; yea,

262
00:55:34,0 --> 00:55:34,0
and he

263
00:55:34,0 --> 00:55:34,0
became

264
00:55:34,0 --> 00:55:34,0
weak, even

265
00:55:34,0 --> 00:55:34,0
that he

266
00:55:34,0 --> 00:55:34,0
could not

267
00:55:34,0 --> 00:55:34,0
move his

268
00:55:34,0 --> 00:55:34,0
hands;

269
00:55:34,0 --> 00:55:34,0
therefore he

270
00:55:34,0 --> 00:55:34,0
was

271
00:55:34,0 --> 00:55:34,0
taken by

272
00:55:34,0 --> 00:55:34,0
those that

273
00:55:34,0 --> 00:55:34,0
were with

274
00:55:34,0 --> 00:55:34,0
him, and

275
00:55:34,0 --> 00:55:34,0
carried

276
00:55:34,0 --> 00:55:34,0
helpless,

277
00:55:34,0 --> 00:55:34,0
even until

278
00:55:34,0 --> 01:04:30,
he was laid before his father.

279
01:04:30,0 --> 01:04:30,0
20 And

280
01:04:30,0 --> 01:04:30,0
they

281
01:04:30,0 --> 01:04:30,0
rehearsed

282
01:04:30,0 --> 01:04:30,0
unto his

283
01:04:30,0 --> 01:04:30,0
father

284
01:04:30,0 --> 01:04:30,0
all that

285
01:04:30,0 --> 01:04:30,0
had

286
01:04:30,0 --> 01:04:30,0
happened unto

287
01:04:30,0 --> 01:04:30,0
them;

288
01:04:30,0 --> 01:04:30,0
and his

289
01:04:30,0 --> 01:04:30,0
father

290
01:04:30,0 --> 01:04:30,0
rejoiced,

291
01:04:30,0 --> 01:04:30,0
for he

292
01:04:30,0 --> 01:04:30,0
knew that

293
01:04:30,0 --> 01:04:30,0
it was

294
01:04:30,0 --> 01:06:14,
the power of God.

295
01:06:14,0 --> 01:06:14,0
21 And

296
01:06:14,0 --> 01:06:14,0
he caused

297
01:06:14,0 --> 01:06:14,0
that a

298
01:06:14,0 --> 01:06:14,0


299
01:06:14,0 --> 01:06:14,0
multitude should

300
01:06:14,0 --> 01:06:14,0
be

301
01:06:14,0 --> 01:06:14,0
gathered

302
01:06:14,0 --> 01:06:14,0
together

303
01:06:14,0 --> 01:06:14,0
that they

304
01:06:14,0 --> 01:06:14,0
might

305
01:06:14,0 --> 01:06:14,0
witness

306
01:06:14,0 --> 01:06:14,0
what the

307
01:06:14,0 --> 01:06:14,0
Lord had

308
01:06:14,0 --> 01:06:14,0
done for

309
01:06:14,0 --> 01:06:14,0
his

310
01:06:14,0 --> 01:06:14,0
son, and

311
01:06:14,0 --> 01:06:14,0
also for

312
01:06:14,0 --> 01:06:14,0
those

313
01:06:14,0 --> 01:06:14,0
that were

314
01:06:14,0 --> 01:12:54,
with him.

315
01:12:54,0 --> 01:12:54,0
22 And

316
01:12:54,0 --> 01:12:54,0
he

317
01:12:54,0 --> 01:12:54,0
caused that

318
01:12:54,0 --> 01:12:54,0
the

319
01:12:54,0 --> 01:12:54,0
priests

320
01:12:54,0 --> 01:12:54,0
should

321
01:12:54,0 --> 01:12:54,0
assemble

322
01:12:54,0 --> 01:12:54,0


323
01:12:54,0 --> 01:12:54,0
themselves

324
01:12:54,0 --> 01:12:54,0
together;

325
01:12:54,0 --> 01:12:54,0
and

326
01:12:54,0 --> 01:12:54,0
they

327
01:12:54,0 --> 01:12:54,0
began to

328
01:12:54,0 --> 01:12:54,0
fast, and

329
01:12:54,0 --> 01:12:54,0
to

330
01:12:54,0 --> 01:12:54,0
pray to

331
01:12:54,0 --> 01:12:54,0
the Lord

332
01:12:54,0 --> 01:12:54,0
their

333
01:12:54,0 --> 01:12:54,0
God that

334
01:12:54,0 --> 01:12:54,0
he

335
01:12:54,0 --> 01:12:54,0
would open

336
01:12:54,0 --> 01:12:54,0
the

337
01:12:54,0 --> 01:12:54,0
mouth of

338
01:12:54,0 --> 01:12:54,0
Alma,

339
01:12:54,0 --> 01:12:54,0
that he

340
01:12:54,0 --> 01:12:54,0
might

341
01:12:54,0 --> 01:12:54,0
speak,

342
01:12:54,0 --> 01:12:54,0
and also

343
01:12:54,0 --> 01:12:54,0
that

344
01:12:54,0 --> 01:12:54,0
his

345
01:12:54,0 --> 01:12:54,0
limbs might

346
01:12:54,0 --> 01:12:54,0


347
01:12:54,0 --> 01:12:54,0
receive their

348
01:12:54,0 --> 01:12:54,0


349
01:12:54,0 --> 01:12:54,0
strength—that

350
01:12:54,0 --> 01:12:54,0
the

351
01:12:54,0 --> 01:12:54,0
eyes of

352
01:12:54,0 --> 01:12:54,0
the

353
01:12:54,0 --> 01:12:54,0
people

354
01:12:54,0 --> 01:12:54,0
might be

355
01:12:54,0 --> 01:12:54,0
opened to

356
01:12:54,0 --> 01:15:06,
see and know of the goodness and glory of God.

357
01:15:06,0 --> 01:15:06,0
23 And

358
01:15:06,0 --> 01:15:06,0
it

359
01:15:06,0 --> 01:15:06,0
came to

360
01:15:06,0 --> 01:15:06,0
pass

361
01:15:06,0 --> 01:15:06,0
after

377
01:15:06,0 --> 01:15:06,0
received

378
01:15:06,0 --> 01:15:06,0

01:15:06,0 --> 01:15:06,0

01:15:06,0 --> 01:15:06,0
he

382
01:15:06,0 --> 01:15:06,0
stood up

383
01:15:06,0 --> 01:15:06,0
