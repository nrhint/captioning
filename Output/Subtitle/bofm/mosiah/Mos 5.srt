00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:09,6
Chapter 5 The Saints become the sons and daughters

2
00:00:09,6 --> 00:00:19,2
 of Christ through faith—They are then called by

3
00:00:19,2 --> 00:00:28,8
 the name of Christ—King Benjamin exhorts them to be

4
00:00:28,8 --> 00:00:38,4
 steadfast and immovable in good works. About

5
00:00:38,4 --> 00:00:48,0
 124 B.C.

6
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:54,065
1 And now, it came to pass that when king Benjamin

7
00:00:54,065 --> 00:00:59,815
 had thus spoken to his people, he sent among

8
00:00:59,815 --> 00:01:05,565
 them, desiring to know of his people if they believed

9
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:11,315
 the words which he had spoken unto them

10
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:18,824
2 And they all cried with one voice, saying: Yea,

11
00:01:18,824 --> 00:01:26,11
 we believe all the words which thou hast spoken

12
00:01:26,11 --> 00:01:33,396
 unto us; and also, we know of their surety and

13
00:01:33,396 --> 00:01:40,682
 truth, because of the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent,

14
00:01:40,682 --> 00:01:47,968
 which has wrought a mighty change in us, or in our

15
00:01:47,968 --> 00:01:55,254
 hearts, that we have no more disposition to do

16
00:01:55,254 --> 00:02:02,54
 evil, but to do good continually

17
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:18,356
3 And we, ourselves, also, through the infinite

18
00:02:18,356 --> 00:02:34,356
 goodness of God, and the manifestations of his

19
00:02:34,356 --> 00:02:50,356
 Spirit, have great views of that which is to come; and

20
00:02:50,356 --> 00:03:06,356
 were it expedient, we could prophesy of all

21
00:03:06,356 --> 00:03:22,356
 things

22
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:22,352
4 And it is the faith which we have had on the

23
00:03:22,352 --> 00:03:22,602
 things which our king has spoken unto us that has

24
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:22,852
 brought us to this great knowledge, whereby we do

25
00:03:22,852 --> 00:03:23,102
 rejoice with such exceedingly great joy

26
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:42,932
5 And we are willing to enter into a covenant with

27
00:03:42,932 --> 00:04:02,361
 our God to do his will, and to be obedient to his

28
00:04:02,361 --> 00:04:21,79
 commandments in all things that he shall command

29
00:04:21,79 --> 00:04:41,219
 us, all the remainder of our days, that we may not

30
00:04:41,219 --> 00:05:00,648
 bring upon ourselves a never-ending torment, as

31
00:05:00,648 --> 00:05:20,077
 has been spoken by the angel, that we may not drink

32
00:05:20,077 --> 00:05:39,506
 out of the cup of the wrath of God

33
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:42,272
6 And now, these are the words which king Benjamin

34
00:05:42,272 --> 00:05:45,472
 desired of them; and therefore he said unto them:

35
00:05:45,472 --> 00:05:48,672
 Ye have spoken the words that I desired; and the

36
00:05:48,672 --> 00:05:51,872
 covenant which ye have made is a righteous

37
00:05:51,872 --> 00:05:55,072
 covenant

38
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,021
7 And now, because of the covenant which ye have

39
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:57,021
 made ye shall be called the children of Christ, his

40
00:05:57,021 --> 00:05:58,021
 sons, and his daughters; for behold, this day he

41
00:05:58,021 --> 00:05:59,021
 hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that

42
00:05:59,021 --> 00:06:00,021
 your hearts are changed through faith on his name;

43
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:01,021
 therefore, ye are born of him and have become his

44
00:06:01,021 --> 00:06:02,021
 sons and his daughters

45
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:03,282
8 And under this head ye are made free, and there

46
00:06:03,282 --> 00:06:03,568
 is no other head whereby ye can be made free.

47
00:06:03,568 --> 00:06:03,854
 There is no other name given whereby salvation cometh;

48
00:06:03,854 --> 00:06:04,14
 therefore, I would that ye should take upon you

49
00:06:04,14 --> 00:06:04,426
 the name of Christ, all you that have entered into

50
00:06:04,426 --> 00:06:04,712
 the covenant with God that ye should be obedient

51
00:06:04,712 --> 00:06:04,998
 unto the end of your lives

52
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:07,981
9 And it shall come to pass that whosoever doeth

53
00:06:07,981 --> 00:06:11,731
 this shall be found at the right hand of God, for

54
00:06:11,731 --> 00:06:15,481
 he shall know the name by which he is called; for

55
00:06:15,481 --> 00:06:19,231
 he shall be called by the name of Christ

56
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:25,045
10 And now it shall come to pass, that whosoever

57
00:06:25,045 --> 00:06:31,045
 shall not take upon him the name of Christ must be

58
00:06:31,045 --> 00:06:37,045
 called by some other name; therefore, he findeth

59
00:06:37,045 --> 00:06:43,045
 himself on the left hand of God

60
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:48,203
11 And I would that ye should remember also, that

61
00:06:48,203 --> 00:06:53,203
 this is the name that I said I should give unto

62
00:06:53,203 --> 00:06:58,203
 you that never should be blotted out, except it be

63
00:06:58,203 --> 00:07:03,203
 through transgression; therefore, take heed that ye

64
00:07:03,203 --> 00:07:08,203
 do not transgress, that the name be not blotted

65
00:07:08,203 --> 00:07:13,203
 out of your hearts

66
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:19,833
12 I say unto you, I would that ye should remember

67
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:26,5
 to retain the name written always in your hearts,

68
00:07:26,5 --> 00:07:33,167
 that ye are not found on the left hand of God,

69
00:07:33,167 --> 00:07:39,834
 but that ye hear and know the voice by which ye

70
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:46,501
 shall be called, and also, the name by which he shall

71
00:07:46,501 --> 00:07:53,168
 call you

72
00:07:53,039 --> 00:08:01,039
13 For how knoweth a man the master whom he has

73
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:09,039
 not served, and who is a stranger unto him, and is

74
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:17,039
 far from the thoughts and intents of his heart

75
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:23,078
14 And again, doth a man take an ass which

76
00:08:23,078 --> 00:08:28,792
 belongeth to his neighbor, and keep him? I say unto you,

77
00:08:28,792 --> 00:08:34,506
 Nay; he will not even suffer that he shall feed

78
00:08:34,506 --> 00:08:40,22
 among his flocks, but will drive him away, and cast

79
00:08:40,22 --> 00:08:45,934
 him out. I say unto you, that even so shall it be

80
00:08:45,934 --> 00:08:51,648
 among you if ye know not the name by which ye are

81
00:08:51,648 --> 00:08:57,362
 called

82
00:08:57,07 --> 00:08:58,445
15 Therefore, I would that ye should be steadfast

83
00:08:58,445 --> 00:08:59,82
 and immovable, always abounding in good works,

84
00:08:59,82 --> 00:09:01,195
 that Christ, the Lord God Omnipotent, may seal you

85
00:09:01,195 --> 00:09:02,57
 his, that you may be brought to heaven, that ye may

86
00:09:02,57 --> 00:09:03,945
 have everlasting salvation and eternal life,

87
00:09:03,945 --> 00:09:05,32
 through the wisdom, and power, and justice, and mercy

88
00:09:05,32 --> 00:09:06,695
 of him who created all things, in heaven and in

89
00:09:06,695 --> 00:09:08,07
 earth, who is God above all. Amen.
