00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 5 The Saints become the sons and

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
daughters of Christ through faith—They

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
are then called by the name of Christ—King

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Benjamin exhorts them to be steadfast and

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:17:25,
immovable in good works. About 124 B.C. 

6
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
1 And now, it came to pass that when

7
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
king Benjamin had thus spoken to his

8
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
people, he sent among them, desiring to

9
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
know of his people if they believed

10
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,
the words which he had spoken unto them.

11
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
2 And they all cried with one voice,

12
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
saying: Yea, we believe all the

13
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
words which thou hast spoken unto us;

14
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
and also, we know of their surety and

15
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
truth, because of the Spirit of the

16
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
Lord Omnipotent, which has wrought

17
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
a mighty change in us, or in our

18
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
hearts, that we have no more

19
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,
disposition to do evil, but to do good continually.

20
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
3 And we, ourselves, also,

21
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
through the infinite goodness of God,

22
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
and the manifestations of his

23
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
Spirit, have great views of that

24
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
which is to come; and were it

25
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,
expedient, we could prophesy of all things.

26
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
4 And it is the faith which we

27
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
have had on the things which

28
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
our king has spoken unto us that

29
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
has brought us to this great

30
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
knowledge, whereby we do rejoice

31
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,
with such exceedingly great joy.

32
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
5 And we are willing to enter

33
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
into a covenant with our God

34
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
to do his will, and to be

35
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
obedient to his commandments in all

36
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
things that he shall command

37
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
us, all the remainder of our

38
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
days, that we may not bring

39
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
upon ourselves a never-ending

40
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
torment, as has been spoken by

41
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
the angel, that we may not drink

42
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,
out of the cup of the wrath of God.

43
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
6 And now, these are the

44
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
words which king Benjamin

45
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
desired of them; and therefore he

46
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
said unto them: Ye have

47
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
spoken the words that I

48
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
desired; and the covenant which ye

49
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,
have made is a righteous covenant.

50
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
7 And now, because of the

51
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
covenant which ye have

52
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
made ye shall be called the

53
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
children of Christ, his

54
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
sons, and his daughters; for

55
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
behold, this day he hath

56
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
spiritually begotten you;

57
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
for ye say that your hearts

58
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
are changed through faith

59
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
on his name; therefore,

60
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
ye are born of him and have

61
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,
become his sons and his daughters.

62
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
8 And under this head ye

63
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
are made free, and there

64
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
is no other head whereby

65
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
ye can be made free.

66
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
There is no other name given

67
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
whereby salvation cometh;

68
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
therefore, I would that

69
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
ye should take upon you

70
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
the name of Christ, all

71
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
you that have entered into

72
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
the covenant with God

73
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
that ye should be obedient

74
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,
unto the end of your lives.

75
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
9 And it shall come to

76
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
pass that whosoever

77
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
doeth this shall be found

78
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
at the right hand of

79
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
God, for he shall know

80
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
the name by which he is

81
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
called; for he shall be

82
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,
called by the name of Christ.

83
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
10 And now it shall

84
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
come to pass, that

85
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
whosoever shall not take

86
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
upon him the name of

87
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
Christ must be called by

88
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
some other name;

89
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
therefore, he findeth

90
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,
himself on the left hand of God.

91
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
11 And I would that

92
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
ye should remember

93
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
also, that this is

94
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
the name that I said I

95
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
should give unto

96
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
you that never should

97
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
be blotted out,

98
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
except it be through

99
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
transgression;

100
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
therefore, take heed that ye

101
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
do not transgress,

102
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
that the name be not

103
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,
blotted out of your hearts.

104
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
12 I say unto you,

105
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
I would that ye

106
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
should remember to

107
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
retain the name

108
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
written always in your

109
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
hearts, that ye are

110
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
not found on the

111
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
left hand of God, but

112
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
that ye hear and

113
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
know the voice by

114
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
which ye shall be

115
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
called, and also, the

116
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,
name by which he shall call you.

117
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
13 For how knoweth

118
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
a man the master

119
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
whom he has not

120
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
served, and who is a

121
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
stranger unto

122
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
him, and is far from

123
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
the thoughts and

124
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,
intents of his heart?

125
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
14 And again,

126
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
doth a man take an

127
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
ass which

128
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
belongeth to his

129
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
neighbor, and keep him? I

130
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
say unto you,

131
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
Nay; he will not

132
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
even suffer that he

133
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
shall feed among

134
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
his flocks, but

135
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
will drive him

136
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
away, and cast him

137
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
out. I say unto

138
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
you, that even so

139
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
shall it be among

140
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
you if ye know

141
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
not the name by

142
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,
which ye are called.

143
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
15 Therefore, I

144
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
would that ye

145
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
should be

146
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
steadfast and immovable,

147
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
always

148
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
abounding in good works,

149
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
that Christ,

150
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
the Lord God

151
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
Omnipotent, may seal

152
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
you his, that

153
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
you may be brought

154
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
to heaven, that

155
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
ye may have

156
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
everlasting

157
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
salvation and eternal

158
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
life, through the

159
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
wisdom, and

160
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
power, and justice,

161
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
and mercy of

162
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
him who created

163
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
all things, in

164
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,0
heaven and in

165
00:17:25,0 --> 00:17:25,
earth, who is God above all. Amen.
