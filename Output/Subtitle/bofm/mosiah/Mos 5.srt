00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:02,6
Chapter 5 The Saints become the sons and

2
00:00:02,6 --> 00:00:05,2
daughters of Christ through faith—They

3
00:00:05,2 --> 00:00:07,8
are then called by the name of Christ—King

4
00:00:07,8 --> 00:00:10,4
Benjamin exhorts them to be steadfast and

5
00:00:10,4 --> 00:00:13,847
immovable in good works. About 124 B.C. 

6
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,847
1 And now, it came to pass that when

7
00:00:16,847 --> 00:00:19,847
king Benjamin had thus spoken to his

8
00:00:19,847 --> 00:00:22,847
people, he sent among them, desiring to

9
00:00:22,847 --> 00:00:25,847
know of his people if they believed

10
00:00:25,847 --> 00:00:28,128
the words which he had spoken unto them.

11
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:29,572
2 And they all cried with one voice,

12
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:31,016
saying: Yea, we believe all the

13
00:00:31,016 --> 00:00:32,46
words which thou hast spoken unto us;

14
00:00:32,46 --> 00:00:33,904
and also, we know of their surety and

15
00:00:33,904 --> 00:00:35,348
truth, because of the Spirit of the

16
00:00:35,348 --> 00:00:36,792
Lord Omnipotent, which has wrought

17
00:00:36,792 --> 00:00:38,236
a mighty change in us, or in our

18
00:00:38,236 --> 00:00:39,68
hearts, that we have no more

19
00:00:39,68 --> 00:00:41,942
disposition to do evil, but to do good continually.

20
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:44,775
3 And we, ourselves, also,

21
00:00:44,775 --> 00:00:47,608
through the infinite goodness of God,

22
00:00:47,608 --> 00:00:50,441
and the manifestations of his

23
00:00:50,441 --> 00:00:53,274
Spirit, have great views of that

24
00:00:53,274 --> 00:00:56,107
which is to come; and were it

25
00:00:56,107 --> 00:00:58,859
expedient, we could prophesy of all things.

26
00:00:58,859 --> 00:00:58,692
4 And it is the faith which we

27
00:00:58,692 --> 00:00:58,525
have had on the things which

28
00:00:58,525 --> 00:00:58,358
our king has spoken unto us that

29
00:00:58,358 --> 00:00:58,191
has brought us to this great

30
00:00:58,191 --> 00:00:58,024
knowledge, whereby we do rejoice

31
00:00:58,024 --> 00:00:57,925
with such exceedingly great joy.

32
00:00:57,925 --> 00:00:57,925
5 And we are willing to enter

33
00:00:57,925 --> 00:00:57,925
into a covenant with our God

34
00:00:57,925 --> 00:00:57,925
to do his will, and to be

35
00:00:57,925 --> 00:00:57,925
obedient to his commandments in all

36
00:00:57,925 --> 00:00:57,925
things that he shall command

37
00:00:57,925 --> 00:00:57,925
us, all the remainder of our

38
00:00:57,925 --> 00:00:57,925
days, that we may not bring

39
00:00:57,925 --> 00:00:57,925
upon ourselves a never-ending

40
00:00:57,925 --> 00:00:57,925
torment, as has been spoken by

41
00:00:57,925 --> 00:00:57,925
the angel, that we may not drink

42
00:00:57,925 --> 00:00:57,457
out of the cup of the wrath of God.

43
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:59,171
6 And now, these are the

44
00:00:59,171 --> 00:01:00,885
words which king Benjamin

45
00:01:00,885 --> 00:01:02,599
desired of them; and therefore he

46
00:01:02,599 --> 00:01:04,313
said unto them: Ye have

47
00:01:04,313 --> 00:01:06,027
spoken the words that I

48
00:01:06,027 --> 00:01:07,741
desired; and the covenant which ye

49
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:09,369
have made is a righteous covenant.

50
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:09,952
7 And now, because of the

51
00:01:09,952 --> 00:01:10,535
covenant which ye have

52
00:01:10,535 --> 00:01:11,118
made ye shall be called the

53
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:11,701
children of Christ, his

54
00:01:11,701 --> 00:01:12,284
sons, and his daughters; for

55
00:01:12,284 --> 00:01:12,867
behold, this day he hath

56
00:01:12,867 --> 00:01:13,45
spiritually begotten you;

57
00:01:13,45 --> 00:01:14,033
for ye say that your hearts

58
00:01:14,033 --> 00:01:14,616
are changed through faith

59
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:15,199
on his name; therefore,

60
00:01:15,199 --> 00:01:15,782
ye are born of him and have

61
00:01:15,782 --> 00:01:16,376
become his sons and his daughters.

62
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:17,145
8 And under this head ye

63
00:01:17,145 --> 00:01:17,914
are made free, and there

64
00:01:17,914 --> 00:01:18,683
is no other head whereby

65
00:01:18,683 --> 00:01:19,452
ye can be made free.

66
00:01:19,452 --> 00:01:20,221
There is no other name given

67
00:01:20,221 --> 00:01:20,99
whereby salvation cometh;

68
00:01:20,99 --> 00:01:21,759
therefore, I would that

69
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:22,528
ye should take upon you

70
00:01:22,528 --> 00:01:23,297
the name of Christ, all

71
00:01:23,297 --> 00:01:24,066
you that have entered into

72
00:01:24,066 --> 00:01:24,835
the covenant with God

73
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:25,604
that ye should be obedient

74
00:01:25,604 --> 00:01:26,253
unto the end of your lives.

75
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:26,628
9 And it shall come to

76
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:27,003
pass that whosoever

77
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:27,378
doeth this shall be found

78
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:27,753
at the right hand of

79
00:01:27,753 --> 00:01:28,128
God, for he shall know

80
00:01:28,128 --> 00:01:28,503
the name by which he is

81
00:01:28,503 --> 00:01:28,878
called; for he shall be

82
00:01:28,878 --> 00:01:29,723
called by the name of Christ.

83
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:30,473
10 And now it shall

84
00:01:30,473 --> 00:01:31,223
come to pass, that

85
00:01:31,223 --> 00:01:31,973
whosoever shall not take

86
00:01:31,973 --> 00:01:32,723
upon him the name of

87
00:01:32,723 --> 00:01:33,473
Christ must be called by

88
00:01:33,473 --> 00:01:34,223
some other name;

89
00:01:34,223 --> 00:01:34,973
therefore, he findeth

90
00:01:34,973 --> 00:01:35,596
himself on the left hand of God.

91
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:35,519
11 And I would that

92
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:35,442
ye should remember

93
00:01:35,442 --> 00:01:35,365
also, that this is

94
00:01:35,365 --> 00:01:35,287
the name that I said I

95
00:01:35,287 --> 00:01:35,21
should give unto

96
00:01:35,21 --> 00:01:35,133
you that never should

97
00:01:35,133 --> 00:01:35,056
be blotted out,

98
00:01:35,056 --> 00:01:34,98
except it be through

99
00:01:34,98 --> 00:01:34,903
transgression;

100
00:01:34,903 --> 00:01:34,826
therefore, take heed that ye

101
00:01:34,826 --> 00:01:34,749
do not transgress,

102
00:01:34,749 --> 00:01:34,671
that the name be not

103
00:01:34,671 --> 00:01:34,661
blotted out of your hearts.

104
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:34,584
12 I say unto you,

105
00:01:34,584 --> 00:01:34,507
I would that ye

106
00:01:34,507 --> 00:01:34,43
should remember to

107
00:01:34,43 --> 00:01:34,353
retain the name

108
00:01:34,353 --> 00:01:34,276
written always in your

109
00:01:34,276 --> 00:01:34,199
hearts, that ye are

110
00:01:34,199 --> 00:01:34,122
not found on the

111
00:01:34,122 --> 00:01:34,045
left hand of God, but

112
00:01:34,045 --> 00:01:33,968
that ye hear and

113
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:33,891
know the voice by

114
00:01:33,891 --> 00:01:33,814
which ye shall be

115
00:01:33,814 --> 00:01:33,737
called, and also, the

116
00:01:33,737 --> 00:01:33,727
name by which he shall call you.

117
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:33,602
13 For how knoweth

118
00:01:33,602 --> 00:01:33,477
a man the master

119
00:01:33,477 --> 00:01:33,352
whom he has not

120
00:01:33,352 --> 00:01:33,227
served, and who is a

121
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:33,102
stranger unto

122
00:01:33,102 --> 00:01:32,977
him, and is far from

123
00:01:32,977 --> 00:01:32,852
the thoughts and

124
00:01:32,852 --> 00:01:32,793
intents of his heart?

125
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:32,737
14 And again,

126
00:01:32,737 --> 00:01:32,681
doth a man take an

127
00:01:32,681 --> 00:01:32,625
ass which

128
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:32,569
belongeth to his

129
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:32,513
neighbor, and keep him? I

130
00:01:32,513 --> 00:01:32,457
say unto you,

131
00:01:32,457 --> 00:01:32,401
Nay; he will not

132
00:01:32,401 --> 00:01:32,345
even suffer that he

133
00:01:32,345 --> 00:01:32,289
shall feed among

134
00:01:32,289 --> 00:01:32,233
his flocks, but

135
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:32,177
will drive him

136
00:01:32,177 --> 00:01:32,121
away, and cast him

137
00:01:32,121 --> 00:01:32,065
out. I say unto

138
00:01:32,065 --> 00:01:32,009
you, that even so

139
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:31,953
shall it be among

140
00:01:31,953 --> 00:01:31,897
you if ye know

141
00:01:31,897 --> 00:01:31,841
not the name by

142
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:31,858
which ye are called.

143
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:31,858
15 Therefore, I

144
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:31,858
would that ye

145
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:31,858
should be

146
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:31,858
steadfast and immovable,

147
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:31,858
always

148
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:31,858
abounding in good works,

149
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:31,858
that Christ,

150
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:31,858
the Lord God

151
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:31,858
Omnipotent, may seal

152
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:31,858
you his, that

153
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:31,858
you may be brought

154
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:31,858
to heaven, that

155
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:31,858
ye may have

156
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:31,858
everlasting

157
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:31,858
salvation and eternal

158
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:31,858
life, through the

159
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:31,858
wisdom, and

160
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:31,858
power, and justice,

161
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:31,858
and mercy of

162
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:31,858
him who created

163
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:31,858
all things, in

164
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:31,858
heaven and in

165
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:31,391
earth, who is God above all. Amen.
