00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,4
Chapter 13 Abinadi is protected by divine power—He

2
00:00:01,4 --> 00:00:02,8
 teaches the Ten Commandments—Salvation does not

3
00:00:02,8 --> 00:00:04,2
 come by the law of Moses alone—God Himself will

4
00:00:04,2 --> 00:00:05,6
 make an atonement and redeem His people. About

5
00:00:05,6 --> 00:00:07,0
 148 B.C.

6
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,975
1 And now when the king had heard these words, he

7
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:11,975
 said unto his priests: Away with this fellow, and

8
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:13,975
 slay him; for what have we to do with him, for he

9
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:15,975
 is mad

10
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,616
2 And they stood forth and attempted to lay their

11
00:00:18,616 --> 00:00:21,283
 hands on him; but he withstood them, and said unto

12
00:00:21,283 --> 00:00:23,95
 them

13
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,257
3 Touch me not, for God shall smite you if ye lay

14
00:00:25,257 --> 00:00:26,59
 your hands upon me, for I have not delivered the

15
00:00:26,59 --> 00:00:27,923
 message which the Lord sent me to deliver; neither

16
00:00:27,923 --> 00:00:29,256
 have I told you that which ye requested that I

17
00:00:29,256 --> 00:00:30,589
 should tell; therefore, God will not suffer that I

18
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:31,922
 shall be destroyed at this time

19
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,499
4 But I must fulfil the commandments wherewith God

20
00:00:33,499 --> 00:00:35,099
 has commanded me; and because I have told you the

21
00:00:35,099 --> 00:00:36,699
 truth ye are angry with me. And again, because I

22
00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:38,299
 have spoken the word of God ye have judged me that

23
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:39,899
 I am mad

24
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,206
5 Now it came to pass after Abinadi had spoken

25
00:00:41,206 --> 00:00:42,539
 these words that the people of king Noah durst not

26
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:43,872
 lay their hands on him, for the Spirit of the Lord

27
00:00:43,872 --> 00:00:45,205
 was upon him; and his face shone with exceeding

28
00:00:45,205 --> 00:00:46,538
 luster, even as Moses’ did while in the mount of

29
00:00:46,538 --> 00:00:47,871
 Sinai, while speaking with the Lord

30
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:55,848
6 And he spake with power and authority from God;

31
00:00:55,848 --> 00:01:03,848
 and he continued his words, saying

32
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:13,797
7 Ye see that ye have not power to slay me,

33
00:01:13,797 --> 00:01:23,797
 therefore I finish my message. Yea, and I perceive that

34
00:01:23,797 --> 00:01:33,797
 it cuts you to your hearts because I tell you the

35
00:01:33,797 --> 00:01:43,797
 truth concerning your iniquities

36
00:01:43,67 --> 00:02:43,67
8 Yea, and my words fill you with wonder and

37
00:02:43,67 --> 00:03:43,67
 amazement, and with anger

38
00:03:43,29 --> 00:03:57,79
9 But I finish my message; and then it matters not

39
00:03:57,79 --> 00:04:12,29
 whither I go, if it so be that I am saved

40
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:19,253
10 But this much I tell you, what you do with me,

41
00:04:19,253 --> 00:04:25,92
 after this, shall be as a type and a shadow of

42
00:04:25,92 --> 00:04:32,587
 things which are to come

43
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:33,905
11 And now I read unto you the remainder of the

44
00:04:33,905 --> 00:04:35,505
 commandments of God, for I perceive that they are

45
00:04:35,505 --> 00:04:37,105
 not written in your hearts; I perceive that ye have

46
00:04:37,105 --> 00:04:38,705
 studied and taught iniquity the most part of your

47
00:04:38,705 --> 00:04:40,305
 lives

48
00:04:40,28 --> 00:04:43,48
12 And now, ye remember that I said unto you: Thou

49
00:04:43,48 --> 00:04:46,68
 shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any

50
00:04:46,68 --> 00:04:49,88
 likeness of things which are in heaven above, or

51
00:04:49,88 --> 00:04:53,08
 which are in the earth beneath, or which are in

52
00:04:53,08 --> 00:04:56,28
 the water under the earth

53
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:59,429
13 And again: Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto

54
00:04:59,429 --> 00:05:02,629
 them, nor serve them; for I the Lord thy God am a

55
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:05,829
 jealous God, visiting the iniquities of the

56
00:05:05,829 --> 00:05:09,029
 fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth

57
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:12,229
 generations of them that hate me

58
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:16,179
14 And showing mercy unto thousands of them that

59
00:05:16,179 --> 00:05:20,179
 love me and keep my commandments

60
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,82
15 Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy

61
00:05:22,82 --> 00:05:25,487
 God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him

62
00:05:25,487 --> 00:05:28,154
 guiltless that taketh his name in vain

63
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:44,128
16 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy

64
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:52,077
17 Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work

65
00:05:52,077 --> 00:06:00,077


66
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:03,026
18 But the seventh day, the sabbath of the Lord

67
00:06:03,026 --> 00:06:06,026
 thy God, thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy

68
00:06:06,026 --> 00:06:09,026
 son, nor thy daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy

69
00:06:09,026 --> 00:06:12,026
 maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that

70
00:06:12,026 --> 00:06:15,026
 is within thy gates

71
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:18,643
19 For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth,

72
00:06:18,643 --> 00:06:21,31
 and the sea, and all that in them is; wherefore

73
00:06:21,31 --> 00:06:23,977
 the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it

74
00:06:23,95 --> 00:06:26,617
20 Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days

75
00:06:26,617 --> 00:06:29,284
 may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God

76
00:06:29,284 --> 00:06:31,951
 giveth thee

77
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:47,925
21 Thou shalt not kill

78
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:55,874
22 Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not

79
00:06:55,874 --> 00:07:03,874
 steal

80
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:19,823
23 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy

81
00:07:19,823 --> 00:07:35,823
 neighbor

82
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:43,722
24 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s house, thou

83
00:07:43,722 --> 00:07:51,722
 shalt not covet thy neighbor’s wife, nor his

84
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:59,722
 man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his

85
00:07:59,722 --> 00:08:07,722
 ass, nor anything that is thy neighbor’s

86
00:08:07,62 --> 00:08:14,02
25 And it came to pass that after Abinadi had made

87
00:08:14,02 --> 00:08:20,42
 an end of these sayings that he said unto them:

88
00:08:20,42 --> 00:08:26,82
 Have ye taught this people that they should observe

89
00:08:26,82 --> 00:08:33,22
 to do all these things for to keep these

90
00:08:33,22 --> 00:08:39,62
 commandments

91
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:47,519
26 I say unto you, Nay; for if ye had, the Lord

92
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:55,519
 would not have caused me to come forth and to

93
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:03,519
 prophesy evil concerning this people

94
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:12,276
27 And now ye have said that salvation cometh by

95
00:09:12,276 --> 00:09:21,109
 the law of Moses. I say unto you that it is

96
00:09:21,109 --> 00:09:29,942
 expedient that ye should keep the law of Moses as yet;

97
00:09:29,942 --> 00:09:38,775
 but I say unto you, that the time shall come when it

98
00:09:38,775 --> 00:09:47,608
 shall no more be expedient to keep the law of

99
00:09:47,608 --> 00:09:56,441
 Moses

100
00:09:56,996 --> 00:10:18,329
28 And moreover, I say unto you, that salvation

101
00:10:18,329 --> 00:10:39,662
 doth not come by the law alone; and were it not for

102
00:10:39,662 --> 00:11:00,995
 the atonement, which God himself shall make for

103
00:11:00,995 --> 00:11:22,328
 the sins and iniquities of his people, that they

104
00:11:22,328 --> 00:11:43,661
 must unavoidably perish, notwithstanding the law of

105
00:11:43,661 --> 00:12:04,994
 Moses

106
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:06,191
29 And now I say unto you that it was expedient

107
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:07,791
 that there should be a law given to the children of

108
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,391
 Israel, yea, even a very strict law; for they were

109
00:12:09,391 --> 00:12:10,991
 a stiffnecked people, quick to do iniquity, and

110
00:12:10,991 --> 00:12:12,591
 slow to remember the Lord their God

111
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,765
30 Therefore there was a law given them, yea, a

112
00:12:15,765 --> 00:12:18,965
 law of performances and of ordinances, a law which

113
00:12:18,965 --> 00:12:22,165
 they were to observe strictly from day to day, to

114
00:12:22,165 --> 00:12:25,365
 keep them in remembrance of God and their duty

115
00:12:25,365 --> 00:12:28,565
 towards him

116
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:48,514
31 But behold, I say unto you, that all these

117
00:12:48,514 --> 00:13:08,514
 things were types of things to come

118
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:09,721
32 And now, did they understand the law? I say

119
00:13:09,721 --> 00:13:11,054
 unto you, Nay, they did not all understand the law;

120
00:13:11,054 --> 00:13:12,387
 and this because of the hardness of their hearts;

121
00:13:12,387 --> 00:13:13,72
 for they understood not that there could not any

122
00:13:13,72 --> 00:13:15,053
 man be saved except it were through the redemption

123
00:13:15,053 --> 00:13:16,386
 of God

124
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:17,695
33 For behold, did not Moses prophesy unto them

125
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,028
 concerning the coming of the Messiah, and that God

126
00:13:19,028 --> 00:13:20,361
 should redeem his people? Yea, and even all the

127
00:13:20,361 --> 00:13:21,694
 prophets who have prophesied ever since the world

128
00:13:21,694 --> 00:13:23,027
 began—have they not spoken more or less concerning

129
00:13:23,027 --> 00:13:24,36
 these things

130
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:24,837
34 Have they not said that God himself should come

131
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:25,337
 down among the children of men, and take upon him

132
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:25,837
 the form of man, and go forth in mighty power

133
00:13:25,837 --> 00:13:26,337
 upon the face of the earth

134
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,723
35 Yea, and have they not said also that he should

135
00:13:28,723 --> 00:13:30,473
 bring to pass the resurrection of the dead, and

136
00:13:30,473 --> 00:13:32,223
 that he, himself, should be oppressed and

137
00:13:32,223 --> 00:13:33,973
 afflicted?
