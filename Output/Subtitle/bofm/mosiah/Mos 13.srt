Chapter 13 Abinadi is protected by

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
divine power—He teaches the Ten

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Commandments—Salvation does not come by the law of

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Moses alone—God Himself will make an

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:07:29,
atonement and redeem His people. About 148 B.C. 

6
00:07:29,0 --> 00:07:29,0
1 And now when the king had heard these

7
00:07:29,0 --> 00:07:29,0
words, he said unto his priests: Away

8
00:07:29,0 --> 00:07:29,0
with this fellow, and slay him; for

9
00:07:29,0 --> 00:12:57,
what have we to do with him, for he is mad.

10
00:12:57,0 --> 00:12:57,0
2 And they stood forth and

11
00:12:57,0 --> 00:12:57,0
attempted to lay their hands on him; but he

12
00:12:57,0 --> 00:21:39,
withstood them, and said unto them:

13
00:21:39,0 --> 00:21:39,0
3 Touch me not, for God shall smite

14
00:21:39,0 --> 00:21:39,0
you if ye lay your hands upon me,

15
00:21:39,0 --> 00:21:39,0
for I have not delivered the

16
00:21:39,0 --> 00:21:39,0
message which the Lord sent me to

17
00:21:39,0 --> 00:21:39,0
deliver; neither have I told you that

18
00:21:39,0 --> 00:21:39,0
which ye requested that I should tell;

19
00:21:39,0 --> 00:21:39,0
therefore, God will not suffer that

20
00:21:39,0 --> 00:23:51,
I shall be destroyed at this time.

21
00:23:51,0 --> 00:23:51,0
4 But I must fulfil the

22
00:23:51,0 --> 00:23:51,0
commandments wherewith God has commanded me;

23
00:23:51,0 --> 00:23:51,0
and because I have told you the

24
00:23:51,0 --> 00:23:51,0
truth ye are angry with me. And again,

25
00:23:51,0 --> 00:23:51,0
because I have spoken the word of

26
00:23:51,0 --> 00:25:03,
God ye have judged me that I am mad.

27
00:25:03,0 --> 00:25:03,0
5 Now it came to pass after

28
00:25:03,0 --> 00:25:03,0
Abinadi had spoken these words

29
00:25:03,0 --> 00:25:03,0
that the people of king Noah durst

30
00:25:03,0 --> 00:25:03,0
not lay their hands on him,

31
00:25:03,0 --> 00:25:03,0
for the Spirit of the Lord was

32
00:25:03,0 --> 00:25:03,0
upon him; and his face shone with

33
00:25:03,0 --> 00:25:03,0
exceeding luster, even as

34
00:25:03,0 --> 00:25:03,0
Moses’ did while in the mount of

35
00:25:03,0 --> 00:36:11,
Sinai, while speaking with the Lord.

36
00:36:11,0 --> 00:36:11,0
6 And he spake with power

37
00:36:11,0 --> 00:36:11,0
and authority from God; and he

38
00:36:11,0 --> 00:38:53,
continued his words, saying:

39
00:38:53,0 --> 00:38:53,0
7 Ye see that ye have not

40
00:38:53,0 --> 00:38:53,0
power to slay me,

41
00:38:53,0 --> 00:38:53,0
therefore I finish my message.

42
00:38:53,0 --> 00:38:53,0
Yea, and I perceive that it

43
00:38:53,0 --> 00:38:53,0
cuts you to your hearts

44
00:38:53,0 --> 00:38:53,0
because I tell you the truth

45
00:38:53,0 --> 00:41:05,
concerning your iniquities.

46
00:41:05,0 --> 00:41:05,0
8 Yea, and my words

47
00:41:05,0 --> 00:41:05,0
fill you with wonder and

48
00:41:05,0 --> 00:44:35,
amazement, and with anger.

49
00:44:35,0 --> 00:44:35,0
9 But I finish my

50
00:44:35,0 --> 00:44:35,0
message; and then

51
00:44:35,0 --> 00:44:35,0
it matters not

52
00:44:35,0 --> 00:44:35,0
whither I go, if it

53
00:44:35,0 --> 00:50:04,
so be that I am saved.

54
00:50:04,0 --> 00:50:04,0
10 But this much

55
00:50:04,0 --> 00:50:04,0
I tell you, what

56
00:50:04,0 --> 00:50:04,0
you do with me,

57
00:50:04,0 --> 00:50:04,0
after this, shall

58
00:50:04,0 --> 00:50:04,0
be as a type and

59
00:50:04,0 --> 00:50:04,0
a shadow of

60
00:50:04,0 --> 00:58:16,
things which are to come.

61
00:58:16,0 --> 00:58:16,0
11 And now I

62
00:58:16,0 --> 00:58:16,0
read unto you the

63
00:58:16,0 --> 00:58:16,0
remainder of

64
00:58:16,0 --> 00:58:16,0
the commandments

65
00:58:16,0 --> 00:58:16,0
of God, for I

66
00:58:16,0 --> 00:58:16,0
perceive that

67
00:58:16,0 --> 00:58:16,0
they are not

68
00:58:16,0 --> 00:58:16,0
written in your

69
00:58:16,0 --> 00:58:16,0
hearts; I

70
00:58:16,0 --> 00:58:16,0
perceive that ye have

71
00:58:16,0 --> 00:58:16,0
studied and

72
00:58:16,0 --> 00:58:16,0
taught iniquity

73
00:58:16,0 --> 01:08:56,
the most part of your lives.

74
01:08:56,0 --> 01:08:56,0
12 And now, ye

75
01:08:56,0 --> 01:08:56,0
remember that

76
01:08:56,0 --> 01:08:56,0
I said unto

77
01:08:56,0 --> 01:08:56,0
you: Thou shalt

78
01:08:56,0 --> 01:08:56,0
not make unto

79
01:08:56,0 --> 01:08:56,0
thee any

80
01:08:56,0 --> 01:08:56,0
graven image, or

81
01:08:56,0 --> 01:08:56,0
any likeness of

82
01:08:56,0 --> 01:08:56,0
things which

83
01:08:56,0 --> 01:08:56,0
are in heaven

84
01:08:56,0 --> 01:08:56,0
above, or

85
01:08:56,0 --> 01:08:56,0
which are in the

86
01:08:56,0 --> 01:08:56,0
earth beneath,

87
01:08:56,0 --> 01:08:56,0
or which are

88
01:08:56,0 --> 01:08:28,
in the water under the earth.

89
01:08:28,0 --> 01:08:28,0
13 And again:

90
01:08:28,0 --> 01:08:28,0
Thou shalt

91
01:08:28,0 --> 01:08:28,0
not bow down

92
01:08:28,0 --> 01:08:28,0
thyself unto

93
01:08:28,0 --> 01:08:28,0
them, nor

94
01:08:28,0 --> 01:08:28,0
serve them; for I

95
01:08:28,0 --> 01:08:28,0
the Lord thy

96
01:08:28,0 --> 01:08:28,0
God am a

97
01:08:28,0 --> 01:08:28,0
jealous God,

98
01:08:28,0 --> 01:08:28,0
visiting the

99
01:08:28,0 --> 01:08:28,0
iniquities of

100
01:08:28,0 --> 01:08:28,0
the fathers

101
01:08:28,0 --> 01:08:28,0
upon the

102
01:08:28,0 --> 01:08:28,0
children, unto the

103
01:08:28,0 --> 01:08:28,0
third and

104
01:08:28,0 --> 01:08:28,0
fourth

105
01:08:28,0 --> 01:10:56,
generations of them that hate me;

106
01:10:56,0 --> 01:10:56,0
14 And

107
01:10:56,0 --> 01:10:56,0
showing mercy

108
01:10:56,0 --> 01:10:56,0
unto

109
01:10:56,0 --> 01:10:56,0
thousands of them

110
01:10:56,0 --> 01:10:56,0
that love

111
01:10:56,0 --> 01:10:56,0
me and keep

112
01:10:56,0 --> 01:11:26,
my commandments.

113
01:11:26,0 --> 01:11:26,0
15 Thou

114
01:11:26,0 --> 01:11:26,0
shalt not

115
01:11:26,0 --> 01:11:26,0
take the

116
01:11:26,0 --> 01:11:26,0
name of the

117
01:11:26,0 --> 01:11:26,0
Lord thy

118
01:11:26,0 --> 01:11:26,0
God in vain;

119
01:11:26,0 --> 01:11:26,0
for the

120
01:11:26,0 --> 01:11:26,0
Lord will

121
01:11:26,0 --> 01:11:26,0
not hold

122
01:11:26,0 --> 01:11:26,0
him

123
01:11:26,0 --> 01:11:26,0
guiltless that

124
01:11:26,0 --> 01:10:58,
taketh his name in vain.

125
01:10:58,0 --> 01:10:58,0
16

126
01:10:58,0 --> 01:10:58,0
Remember the

127
01:10:58,0 --> 01:10:58,0
sabbath

128
01:10:58,0 --> 01:10:58,0
day, to keep

129
01:10:58,0 --> 01:11:42,
it holy.

130
01:11:42,0 --> 01:11:42,0
17 Six

131
01:11:42,0 --> 01:11:42,0
days

132
01:11:42,0 --> 01:11:42,0
shalt thou

133
01:11:42,0 --> 01:11:42,0
labor,

134
01:11:42,0 --> 01:11:42,0
and do all

135
01:11:42,0 --> 01:20:37,
thy work;

136
01:20:37,0 --> 01:20:37,0
18 But

137
01:20:37,0 --> 01:20:37,0
the

138
01:20:37,0 --> 01:20:37,0
seventh

139
01:20:37,0 --> 01:20:37,0
day, the

140
01:20:37,0 --> 01:20:37,0
sabbath

141
01:20:37,0 --> 01:20:37,0
of the

142
01:20:37,0 --> 01:20:37,0
Lord

143
01:20:37,0 --> 01:20:37,0
thy God,

144
01:20:37,0 --> 01:20:37,0
thou

145
01:20:37,0 --> 01:20:37,0
shalt

146
01:20:37,0 --> 01:20:37,0
not do

147
01:20:37,0 --> 01:20:37,0
any work,

148
01:20:37,0 --> 01:20:37,0
thou,

149
01:20:37,0 --> 01:20:37,0
nor thy

150
01:20:37,0 --> 01:20:37,0
son,

151
01:20:37,0 --> 01:20:37,0
nor thy

152
01:20:37,0 --> 01:20:37,0


153
01:20:37,0 --> 01:20:37,0
daughter, thy

154
01:20:37,0 --> 01:20:37,0


155
01:20:37,0 --> 01:20:37,0
man-servant,

156
01:20:37,0 --> 01:20:37,0
nor thy

157
01:20:37,0 --> 01:20:37,0


158

cattle, nor

162
01:20:37,0 --> 01:20:37,0
thy

163
01:20:37,0 --> 01:22:21,
stranger that is within thy gates;

164
01:22:21,0 --> 01:22:21,0
19 For

165
01:22:21,0 --> 01:22:21,0
in

166
01:22:21,0 --> 01:22:21,0
six days

167
01:22:21,0 --> 01:22:21,0
the

01:22:21,0 --> 01:22:21,0
Lord

169
01:22:21,0 --> 01:22:21,0
made

170

01:22:21,0 --> 01:22:21,0
and all

176
01:22:21,0 --> 01:22:21,0
that

177
01:22:21,0 --> 01:22:21,0
in them

178
01:22:21,0 --> 01:22:21,0
is;

179
01:22:21,0 --> 01:22:21,0


180
01:22:21,0 --> 01:22:21,0
wherefore the

182
01:22:21,0 --> 01:22:21,0


183

01:22:21,0 --> 01:22:21,0


185
01:22:21,0 --> 01:31:16,
sabbath day, and hallowed it.

186

20

187
01:31:16,0 --> 01:31:16,0
Honor

196
01:31:16,0 --> 01:31:16,0

adultery.

219
01:32:46,0 --> 01:32:46,0
Thou

220
01:32:46,0 --> 01:32:46,0


221
