1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:03,0
An account of Alma and the people of the Lord,

2
00:00:03,0 --> 00:00:06,0
who were driven into the wilderness by the

3
00:00:06,0 --> 00:00:09,0
people of King Noah. Comprising chapters 23

4
00:00:09,0 --> 00:00:12,0
and 24.Chapter 23 Alma refuses to be king—He serves as

5
00:00:12,0 --> 00:00:15,0
high priest—The Lord chastens His people, and

6
00:00:15,0 --> 00:00:18,0
the Lamanites conquer the land of Helam—Amulon,

7
00:00:18,0 --> 00:00:21,0
leader of King Noah’s wicked priests, rules

8
00:00:21,0 --> 00:00:24,391
subject to the Lamanite monarch. About 145–121 B.C. 

9
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:26,724
1 Now Alma, having been warned of the Lord

10
00:00:26,724 --> 00:00:29,057
that the armies of king Noah would come upon

11
00:00:29,057 --> 00:00:31,39
them, and having made it known to his people,

12
00:00:31,39 --> 00:00:33,723
therefore they gathered together their flocks,

13
00:00:33,723 --> 00:00:36,056
and took of their grain, and departed into

14
00:00:36,056 --> 00:00:38,672
the wilderness before the armies of king Noah.

15
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:43,339
2 And the Lord did strengthen them,

16
00:00:43,339 --> 00:00:48,006
that the people of king Noah could

17
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:52,953
not overtake them to destroy them.

18
00:00:52,953 --> 00:01:04,953
3 And they fled eight days’

19
00:01:04,953 --> 00:01:16,877
journey into the wilderness.

20
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:18,627
4 And they came to a

21
00:01:18,627 --> 00:01:20,377
land, yea, even a very

22
00:01:20,377 --> 00:01:22,127
beautiful and pleasant

23
00:01:22,127 --> 00:01:23,216
land, a land of pure water.

24
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:24,359
5 And they pitched

25
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:25,502
their tents, and

26
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:26,645
began to till the

27
00:01:26,645 --> 00:01:27,788
ground, and began to build

28
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:28,931
buildings; yea,

29
00:01:28,931 --> 00:01:30,074
they were industrious,

30
00:01:30,074 --> 00:01:31,625
and did labor exceedingly.

31
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:35,025
6 And the people

32
00:01:35,025 --> 00:01:38,425
were desirous that

33
00:01:38,425 --> 00:01:41,825
Alma should be their

34
00:01:41,825 --> 00:01:45,225
king, for he was

35
00:01:45,225 --> 00:01:48,041
beloved by his people.

36
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,041
7 But he said unto

37
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,041
them: Behold, it

38
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:51,041
is not expedient

39
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:52,041
that we should have

40
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:53,041
a king; for thus

41
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:54,041
saith the Lord: Ye

42
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:55,041
shall not esteem

43
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:56,041
one flesh above

44
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:57,041
another, or one man

45
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:58,041
shall not think

46
00:01:58,041 --> 00:01:59,041
himself above

47
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:00,041
another; therefore I say

48
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:01,041
unto you it is

49
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:02,041
not expedient that

50
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,023
ye should have a king.

51
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:04,148
8 Nevertheless,

52
00:02:04,148 --> 00:02:05,273
if it were

53
00:02:05,273 --> 00:02:06,398
possible that ye

54
00:02:06,398 --> 00:02:07,523
could always have

55
00:02:07,523 --> 00:02:08,648
just men to be

56
00:02:08,648 --> 00:02:09,773
your kings it would

57
00:02:09,773 --> 00:02:10,898
be well for you

58
00:02:10,898 --> 00:02:12,933
to have a king.

59
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:13,318
9 But remember

60
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:13,703
the iniquity

61
00:02:13,703 --> 00:02:14,088
of king Noah

62
00:02:14,088 --> 00:02:14,473
and his

63
00:02:14,473 --> 00:02:14,858
priests; and I myself

64
00:02:14,858 --> 00:02:15,243
was caught in

65
00:02:15,243 --> 00:02:15,628
a snare, and

66
00:02:15,628 --> 00:02:16,013
did many

67
00:02:16,013 --> 00:02:16,398
things which were

68
00:02:16,398 --> 00:02:16,783
abominable in

69
00:02:16,783 --> 00:02:17,168
the sight of

70
00:02:17,168 --> 00:02:17,553
the Lord, which

71
00:02:17,553 --> 00:02:17,871
caused me sore repentance;

72
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:18,514
10

73
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:19,157
Nevertheless, after

74
00:02:19,157 --> 00:02:19,8
much

75
00:02:19,8 --> 00:02:20,443
tribulation, the Lord

76
00:02:20,443 --> 00:02:21,086
did hear my

77
00:02:21,086 --> 00:02:21,729
cries, and did

78
00:02:21,729 --> 00:02:22,372
answer my

79
00:02:22,372 --> 00:02:23,015
prayers, and has

80
00:02:23,015 --> 00:02:23,658
made me an

81
00:02:23,658 --> 00:02:24,301
instrument in

82
00:02:24,301 --> 00:02:24,944
his hands in

83
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:25,587
bringing so

84
00:02:25,587 --> 00:02:26,23
many of you to

85
00:02:26,23 --> 00:02:26,847
a knowledge of his truth.

86
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:30,014
11

87
00:02:30,014 --> 00:02:33,181
Nevertheless, in this I

88
00:02:33,181 --> 00:02:36,348
do not

89
00:02:36,348 --> 00:02:39,515
glory, for I am

90
00:02:39,515 --> 00:02:42,682
unworthy to

91
00:02:42,682 --> 00:02:45,165
glory of myself.

92
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:45,989
12 And now I

93
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:46,813
say unto

94
00:02:46,813 --> 00:02:47,637
you, ye have

95
00:02:47,637 --> 00:02:48,461
been

96
00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:49,285
oppressed by king

97
00:02:49,285 --> 00:02:50,109
Noah, and have

98
00:02:50,109 --> 00:02:50,933
been in

99
00:02:50,933 --> 00:02:51,757
bondage to him

100
00:02:51,757 --> 00:02:52,581
and his

101
00:02:52,581 --> 00:02:53,405
priests, and

102
00:02:53,405 --> 00:02:54,229
have been

103
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:55,053
brought into

104
00:02:55,053 --> 00:02:55,877
iniquity by

105
00:02:55,877 --> 00:02:56,701
them; therefore

106
00:02:56,701 --> 00:02:57,525
ye were

107
00:02:57,525 --> 00:02:58,349
bound with the

108
00:02:58,349 --> 00:02:59,446
bands of iniquity.

109
00:02:59,446 --> 00:02:59,831
13 And now

110
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:00,216
as ye have

111
00:03:00,216 --> 00:03:00,601
been

112
00:03:00,601 --> 00:03:00,986
delivered by the

113
00:03:00,986 --> 00:03:01,371
power of

114
00:03:01,371 --> 00:03:01,756
God out of

115
00:03:01,756 --> 00:03:02,141
these bonds;

116
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:02,526
yea, even

117
00:03:02,526 --> 00:03:02,911
out of the

118
00:03:02,911 --> 00:03:03,296
hands of

119
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:03,681
king Noah and

120
00:03:03,681 --> 00:03:04,066
his people,

121
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:04,451
and also

122
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:04,836
from the

123
00:03:04,836 --> 00:03:05,221
bonds of

124
00:03:05,221 --> 00:03:05,606
iniquity, even

125
00:03:05,606 --> 00:03:05,991
so I desire

126
00:03:05,991 --> 00:03:06,376
that ye

127
00:03:06,376 --> 00:03:06,761
should stand

128
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:07,146
fast in this

129
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:07,531
liberty

130
00:03:07,531 --> 00:03:07,916
wherewith ye

131
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:08,301
have been

132
00:03:08,301 --> 00:03:08,686
made free,

133
00:03:08,686 --> 00:03:09,071
and that ye

134
00:03:09,071 --> 00:03:09,356
trust no man to be a king over you.

135
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:10,279
14 And

136
00:03:10,279 --> 00:03:11,202
also trust no

137
00:03:11,202 --> 00:03:12,125
one to be

138
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,048
your

139
00:03:13,048 --> 00:03:13,971
teacher nor

140
00:03:13,971 --> 00:03:14,894
your

141
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:15,817
minister, except

142
00:03:15,817 --> 00:03:16,74
he be a

143
00:03:16,74 --> 00:03:17,663
man of God,

144
00:03:17,663 --> 00:03:18,586
walking in

145
00:03:18,586 --> 00:03:19,509
his ways

146
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:20,432
and

147
00:03:20,432 --> 00:03:21,268
keeping his commandments.

148
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:21,982
15 Thus

149
00:03:21,982 --> 00:03:22,696
did Alma

150
00:03:22,696 --> 00:03:23,41
teach his

151
00:03:23,41 --> 00:03:24,124
people,

152
00:03:24,124 --> 00:03:24,838
that every

153
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:25,552
man

154
00:03:25,552 --> 00:03:26,266
should love

155
00:03:26,266 --> 00:03:26,98
his

156
00:03:26,98 --> 00:03:27,694
neighbor as

157
00:03:27,694 --> 00:03:28,408
himself,

158
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:29,122
that there

159
00:03:29,122 --> 00:03:29,836
should be

160
00:03:29,836 --> 00:03:30,55
no

161
00:03:30,55 --> 00:03:31,178
contention among them.

162
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:31,956
16 And

163
00:03:31,956 --> 00:03:32,734
now, Alma

164
00:03:32,734 --> 00:03:33,512
was

165
00:03:33,512 --> 00:03:34,29
their high

166
00:03:34,29 --> 00:03:35,068
priest,

167
00:03:35,068 --> 00:03:35,846
he being

168
00:03:35,846 --> 00:03:36,624
the

169
00:03:36,624 --> 00:03:37,402
founder of

170
00:03:37,402 --> 00:03:38,685
their church.

171
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:39,168
17 And

172
00:03:39,168 --> 00:03:39,651
it came

173
00:03:39,651 --> 00:03:40,134
to

174
00:03:40,134 --> 00:03:40,617
pass that

175
00:03:40,617 --> 00:03:41,1
none

176
00:03:41,1 --> 00:03:41,583
received

177
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:42,066


178
00:03:42,066 --> 00:03:42,549
authority to

179
00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:43,032
preach

180
00:03:43,032 --> 00:03:43,515
or to

181
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:43,998
teach

182
00:03:43,998 --> 00:03:44,481
except it

183
00:03:44,481 --> 00:03:44,964
were by

184
00:03:44,964 --> 00:03:45,447
him

185
00:03:45,447 --> 00:03:45,93
from God.

186
00:03:45,93 --> 00:03:46,413


187
00:03:46,413 --> 00:03:46,896
Therefore he

188
00:03:46,896 --> 00:03:47,379


189
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:47,862
consecrated

190
00:03:47,862 --> 00:03:48,345
all their

191
00:03:48,345 --> 00:03:48,828


192
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:49,311
priests and

193
00:03:49,311 --> 00:03:49,794
all

194
00:03:49,794 --> 00:03:50,277
their

195
00:03:50,277 --> 00:03:50,76
teachers;

196
00:03:50,76 --> 00:03:51,243
and none

197
00:03:51,243 --> 00:03:51,726
were

198
00:03:51,726 --> 00:03:52,209


199
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:52,032
consecrated except they were just men.

200
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:53,782
18

201
00:03:53,782 --> 00:03:55,532
Therefore

202
00:03:55,532 --> 00:03:57,282
they

203
00:03:57,282 --> 00:03:59,032
did

204
00:03:59,032 --> 00:04:00,782
watch

205
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,532
over

206
00:04:02,532 --> 00:04:04,282
