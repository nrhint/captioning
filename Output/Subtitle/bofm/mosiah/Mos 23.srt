1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:03,875
An account of Alma and the people of the Lord, who

2
00:00:03,875 --> 00:00:07,75
 were driven into the wilderness by the people of

3
00:00:07,75 --> 00:00:11,625
 King Noah. Comprising chapters 23 and 24.Chapter

4
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:15,5
 23 Alma refuses to be king—He serves as high

5
00:00:15,5 --> 00:00:19,375
 priest—The Lord chastens His people, and the Lamanites

6
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:23,25
 conquer the land of Helam—Amulon, leader of King

7
00:00:23,25 --> 00:00:27,125
 Noah’s wicked priests, rules subject to the Lamanite

8
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:31,0
 monarch. About 145–121 B.C.

9
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,232
1 Now Alma, having been warned of the Lord that

10
00:00:33,232 --> 00:00:34,565
 the armies of king Noah would come upon them, and

11
00:00:34,565 --> 00:00:35,898
 having made it known to his people, therefore they

12
00:00:35,898 --> 00:00:37,231
 gathered together their flocks, and took of their

13
00:00:37,231 --> 00:00:38,564
 grain, and departed into the wilderness before the

14
00:00:38,564 --> 00:00:39,897
 armies of king Noah

15
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,54
2 And the Lord did strengthen them, that the

16
00:00:42,54 --> 00:00:45,207
 people of king Noah could not overtake them to destroy

17
00:00:45,207 --> 00:00:47,874
 them

18
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:51,848
3 And they fled eight days’ journey into the

19
00:00:51,848 --> 00:00:55,848
 wilderness

20
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:59,822
4 And they came to a land, yea, even a very

21
00:00:59,822 --> 00:01:03,822
 beautiful and pleasant land, a land of pure water

22
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:06,464
5 And they pitched their tents, and began to till

23
00:01:06,464 --> 00:01:09,131
 the ground, and began to build buildings; yea,

24
00:01:09,131 --> 00:01:11,798
 they were industrious, and did labor exceedingly

25
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:15,772
6 And the people were desirous that Alma should be

26
00:01:15,772 --> 00:01:19,772
 their king, for he was beloved by his people

27
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,079
7 But he said unto them: Behold, it is not

28
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:22,412
 expedient that we should have a king; for thus saith the

29
00:01:22,412 --> 00:01:23,745
 Lord: Ye shall not esteem one flesh above another,

30
00:01:23,745 --> 00:01:25,078
 or one man shall not think himself above another;

31
00:01:25,078 --> 00:01:26,411
 therefore I say unto you it is not expedient that

32
00:01:26,411 --> 00:01:27,744
 ye should have a king

33
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:30,388
8 Nevertheless, if it were possible that ye could

34
00:01:30,388 --> 00:01:33,055
 always have just men to be your kings it would be

35
00:01:33,055 --> 00:01:35,722
 well for you to have a king

36
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,696
9 But remember the iniquity of king Noah and his

37
00:01:37,696 --> 00:01:39,696
 priests; and I myself was caught in a snare, and

38
00:01:39,696 --> 00:01:41,696
 did many things which were abominable in the sight

39
00:01:41,696 --> 00:01:43,696
 of the Lord, which caused me sore repentance

40
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:45,67
10 Nevertheless, after much tribulation, the Lord

41
00:01:45,67 --> 00:01:47,67
 did hear my cries, and did answer my prayers, and

42
00:01:47,67 --> 00:01:49,67
 has made me an instrument in his hands in bringing

43
00:01:49,67 --> 00:01:51,67
 so many of you to a knowledge of his truth

44
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:55,645
11 Nevertheless, in this I do not glory, for I am

45
00:01:55,645 --> 00:01:59,645
 unworthy to glory of myself

46
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:01,219
12 And now I say unto you, ye have been oppressed

47
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:02,82
 by king Noah, and have been in bondage to him and

48
00:02:02,82 --> 00:02:04,419
 his priests, and have been brought into iniquity

49
00:02:04,419 --> 00:02:06,02
 by them; therefore ye were bound with the bands of

50
00:02:06,02 --> 00:02:07,62
 iniquity

51
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:08,737
13 And now as ye have been delivered by the power

52
00:02:08,737 --> 00:02:09,88
 of God out of these bonds; yea, even out of the

53
00:02:09,88 --> 00:02:11,023
 hands of king Noah and his people, and also from the

54
00:02:11,023 --> 00:02:12,166
 bonds of iniquity, even so I desire that ye

55
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:13,309
 should stand fast in this liberty wherewith ye have

56
00:02:13,309 --> 00:02:14,452
 been made free, and that ye trust no man to be a king

57
00:02:14,452 --> 00:02:15,595
 over you

58
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:18,236
14 And also trust no one to be your teacher nor

59
00:02:18,236 --> 00:02:20,903
 your minister, except he be a man of God, walking in

60
00:02:20,903 --> 00:02:23,57
 his ways and keeping his commandments

61
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:26,21
15 Thus did Alma teach his people, that every man

62
00:02:26,21 --> 00:02:28,877
 should love his neighbor as himself, that there

63
00:02:28,877 --> 00:02:31,544
 should be no contention among them

64
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:35,518
16 And now, Alma was their high priest, he being

65
00:02:35,518 --> 00:02:39,518
 the founder of their church

66
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,093
17 And it came to pass that none received

67
00:02:41,093 --> 00:02:42,693
 authority to preach or to teach except it were by him from

68
00:02:42,693 --> 00:02:44,293
 God. Therefore he consecrated all their priests

69
00:02:44,293 --> 00:02:45,893
 and all their teachers; and none were consecrated

70
00:02:45,893 --> 00:02:47,493
 except they were just men

71
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:50,134
18 Therefore they did watch over their people, and

72
00:02:50,134 --> 00:02:52,801
 did nourish them with things pertaining to

73
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:55,468
 righteousness

74
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:58,109
19 And it came to pass that they began to prosper

75
00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:00,776
 exceedingly in the land; and they called the land

76
00:03:00,776 --> 00:03:03,443
 Helam

77
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,417
20 And it came to pass that they did multiply and

78
00:03:05,417 --> 00:03:07,417
 prosper exceedingly in the land of Helam; and they

79
00:03:07,417 --> 00:03:09,417
 built a city, which they called the city of

80
00:03:09,417 --> 00:03:11,417
 Helam

81
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:14,058
21 Nevertheless the Lord seeth fit to chasten his

82
00:03:14,058 --> 00:03:16,725
 people; yea, he trieth their patience and their

83
00:03:16,725 --> 00:03:19,392
 faith

84
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:22,033
22 Nevertheless—whosoever putteth his trust in him

85
00:03:22,033 --> 00:03:24,7
 the same shall be lifted up at the last day. Yea,

86
00:03:24,7 --> 00:03:27,367
 and thus it was with this people

87
00:03:27,34 --> 00:03:29,34
23 For behold, I will show unto you that they were

88
00:03:29,34 --> 00:03:31,34
 brought into bondage, and none could deliver them

89
00:03:31,34 --> 00:03:33,34
 but the Lord their God, yea, even the God of

90
00:03:33,34 --> 00:03:35,34
 Abraham and Isaac and of Jacob

91
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,982
24 And it came to pass that he did deliver them,

92
00:03:37,982 --> 00:03:40,649
 and he did show forth his mighty power unto them,

93
00:03:40,649 --> 00:03:43,316
 and great were their rejoicings

94
00:03:43,29 --> 00:03:44,89
25 For behold, it came to pass that while they

95
00:03:44,89 --> 00:03:46,49
 were in the land of Helam, yea, in the city of Helam,

96
00:03:46,49 --> 00:03:48,09
 while tilling the land round about, behold an

97
00:03:48,09 --> 00:03:49,69
 army of the Lamanites was in the borders of the land

98
00:03:49,69 --> 00:03:51,29


99
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:52,864
26 Now it came to pass that the brethren of Alma

100
00:03:52,864 --> 00:03:54,464
 fled from their fields, and gathered themselves

101
00:03:54,464 --> 00:03:56,064
 together in the city of Helam; and they were much

102
00:03:56,064 --> 00:03:57,664
 frightened because of the appearance of the

103
00:03:57,664 --> 00:03:59,264
 Lamanites

104
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,239
27 But Alma went forth and stood among them, and

105
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:03,239
 exhorted them that they should not be frightened,

106
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,239
 but that they should remember the Lord their God

107
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:07,239
 and he would deliver them

108
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:09,214
28 Therefore they hushed their fears, and began to

109
00:04:09,214 --> 00:04:11,214
 cry unto the Lord that he would soften the hearts

110
00:04:11,214 --> 00:04:13,214
 of the Lamanites, that they would spare them, and

111
00:04:13,214 --> 00:04:15,214
 their wives, and their children

112
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,788
29 And it came to pass that the Lord did soften

113
00:04:16,788 --> 00:04:18,388
 the hearts of the Lamanites. And Alma and his

114
00:04:18,388 --> 00:04:19,988
 brethren went forth and delivered themselves up into

115
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:21,588
 their hands; and the Lamanites took possession of the

116
00:04:21,588 --> 00:04:23,188
 land of Helam

117
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:25,83
30 Now the armies of the Lamanites, which had

118
00:04:25,83 --> 00:04:28,497
 followed after the people of king Limhi, had been lost

119
00:04:28,497 --> 00:04:31,164
 in the wilderness for many days

120
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:33,138
31 And behold, they had found those priests of

121
00:04:33,138 --> 00:04:35,138
 king Noah, in a place which they called Amulon; and

122
00:04:35,138 --> 00:04:37,138
 they had begun to possess the land of Amulon and

123
00:04:37,138 --> 00:04:39,138
 had begun to till the ground

124
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:43,112
32 Now the name of the leader of those priests was

125
00:04:43,112 --> 00:04:47,112
 Amulon

126
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:48,687
33 And it came to pass that Amulon did plead with

127
00:04:48,687 --> 00:04:50,287
 the Lamanites; and he also sent forth their wives,

128
00:04:50,287 --> 00:04:51,887
 who were the daughters of the Lamanites, to plead

129
00:04:51,887 --> 00:04:53,487
 with their brethren, that they should not destroy

130
00:04:53,487 --> 00:04:55,087
 their husbands

131
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,728
34 And the Lamanites had compassion on Amulon and

132
00:04:57,728 --> 00:05:00,395
 his brethren, and did not destroy them, because of

133
00:05:00,395 --> 00:05:03,062
 their wives

134
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,636
35 And Amulon and his brethren did join the

135
00:05:04,636 --> 00:05:06,236
 Lamanites, and they were traveling in the wilderness in

136
00:05:06,236 --> 00:05:07,836
 search of the land of Nephi when they discovered

137
00:05:07,836 --> 00:05:09,436
 the land of Helam, which was possessed by Alma and

138
00:05:09,436 --> 00:05:11,036
 his brethren

139
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:12,411
36 And it came to pass that the Lamanites promised

140
00:05:12,411 --> 00:05:13,811
 unto Alma and his brethren, that if they would

141
00:05:13,811 --> 00:05:15,211
 show them the way which led to the land of Nephi

142
00:05:15,211 --> 00:05:16,611
 that they would grant unto them their lives and their

143
00:05:16,611 --> 00:05:18,011
 liberty

144
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,985
37 But after Alma had shown them the way that led

145
00:05:20,985 --> 00:05:22,985
 to the land of Nephi the Lamanites would not keep

146
00:05:22,985 --> 00:05:24,985
 their promise; but they set guards round about the

147
00:05:24,985 --> 00:05:26,985
 land of Helam, over Alma and his brethren

148
00:05:26,96 --> 00:05:28,56
38 And the remainder of them went to the land of

149
00:05:28,56 --> 00:05:30,16
 Nephi; and a part of them returned to the land of

150
00:05:30,16 --> 00:05:31,76
 Helam, and also brought with them the wives and the

151
00:05:31,76 --> 00:05:33,36
 children of the guards who had been left in the

152
00:05:33,36 --> 00:05:34,96
 land

153
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:35,535
39 And the king of the Lamanites had granted unto

154
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:36,135
 Amulon that he should be a king and a ruler over

155
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:36,735
 his people, who were in the land of Helam;

156
00:05:36,735 --> 00:05:37,335
 nevertheless he should have no power to do anything

157
00:05:37,335 --> 00:05:37,935
 contrary to the will of the king of the Lamanites.
