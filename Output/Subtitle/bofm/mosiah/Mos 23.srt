1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
An account of Alma and the people of the Lord,

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
who were driven into the wilderness by the

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
people of King Noah. Comprising chapters 23

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and 24.Chapter 23 Alma refuses to be king—He serves as

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
high priest—The Lord chastens His people, and

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Lamanites conquer the land of Helam—Amulon,

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
leader of King Noah’s wicked priests, rules

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:12:11,
subject to the Lamanite monarch. About 145–121 B.C. 

9
00:12:11,0 --> 00:12:11,0
1 Now Alma, having been warned of the Lord

10
00:12:11,0 --> 00:12:11,0
that the armies of king Noah would come upon

11
00:12:11,0 --> 00:12:11,0
them, and having made it known to his people,

12
00:12:11,0 --> 00:12:11,0
therefore they gathered together their flocks,

13
00:12:11,0 --> 00:12:11,0
and took of their grain, and departed into

14
00:12:11,0 --> 00:11:43,
the wilderness before the armies of king Noah.

15
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
2 And the Lord did strengthen them,

16
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
that the people of king Noah could

17
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:15,
not overtake them to destroy them.

18
00:11:15,0 --> 00:11:15,0
3 And they fled eight days’

19
00:11:15,0 --> 00:10:47,
journey into the wilderness.

20
00:10:47,0 --> 00:10:47,0
4 And they came to a

21
00:10:47,0 --> 00:10:47,0
land, yea, even a very

22
00:10:47,0 --> 00:10:47,0
beautiful and pleasant

23
00:10:47,0 --> 00:11:59,
land, a land of pure water.

24
00:11:59,0 --> 00:11:59,0
5 And they pitched

25
00:11:59,0 --> 00:11:59,0
their tents, and

26
00:11:59,0 --> 00:11:59,0
began to till the

27
00:11:59,0 --> 00:11:59,0
ground, and began to build

28
00:11:59,0 --> 00:11:59,0
buildings; yea,

29
00:11:59,0 --> 00:11:59,0
they were industrious,

30
00:11:59,0 --> 00:15:30,
and did labor exceedingly.

31
00:15:30,0 --> 00:15:30,0
6 And the people

32
00:15:30,0 --> 00:15:30,0
were desirous that

33
00:15:30,0 --> 00:15:30,0
Alma should be their

34
00:15:30,0 --> 00:15:30,0
king, for he was

35
00:15:30,0 --> 00:16:14,
beloved by his people.

36
00:16:14,0 --> 00:16:14,0
7 But he said unto

37
00:16:14,0 --> 00:16:14,0
them: Behold, it

38
00:16:14,0 --> 00:16:14,0
is not expedient

39
00:16:14,0 --> 00:16:14,0
that we should have

40
00:16:14,0 --> 00:16:14,0
a king; for thus

41
00:16:14,0 --> 00:16:14,0
saith the Lord: Ye

42
00:16:14,0 --> 00:16:14,0
shall not esteem

43
00:16:14,0 --> 00:16:14,0
one flesh above

44
00:16:14,0 --> 00:16:14,0
another, or one man

45
00:16:14,0 --> 00:16:14,0
shall not think

46
00:16:14,0 --> 00:16:14,0
himself above

47
00:16:14,0 --> 00:16:14,0
another; therefore I say

48
00:16:14,0 --> 00:16:14,0
unto you it is

49
00:16:14,0 --> 00:16:14,0
not expedient that

50
00:16:14,0 --> 00:19:45,
ye should have a king.

51
00:19:45,0 --> 00:19:45,0
8 Nevertheless,

52
00:19:45,0 --> 00:19:45,0
if it were

53
00:19:45,0 --> 00:19:45,0
possible that ye

54
00:19:45,0 --> 00:19:45,0
could always have

55
00:19:45,0 --> 00:19:45,0
just men to be

56
00:19:45,0 --> 00:19:45,0
your kings it would

57
00:19:45,0 --> 00:19:45,0
be well for you

58
00:19:45,0 --> 00:21:29,
to have a king.

59
00:21:29,0 --> 00:21:29,0
9 But remember

60
00:21:29,0 --> 00:21:29,0
the iniquity

61
00:21:29,0 --> 00:21:29,0
of king Noah

62
00:21:29,0 --> 00:21:29,0
and his

63
00:21:29,0 --> 00:21:29,0
priests; and I myself

64
00:21:29,0 --> 00:21:29,0
was caught in

65
00:21:29,0 --> 00:21:29,0
a snare, and

66
00:21:29,0 --> 00:21:29,0
did many

67
00:21:29,0 --> 00:21:29,0
things which were

68
00:21:29,0 --> 00:21:29,0
abominable in

69
00:21:29,0 --> 00:21:29,0
the sight of

70
00:21:29,0 --> 00:21:29,0
the Lord, which

71
00:21:29,0 --> 00:31:24,
caused me sore repentance;

72
00:31:24,0 --> 00:31:24,0
10

73
00:31:24,0 --> 00:31:24,0
Nevertheless, after

74
00:31:24,0 --> 00:31:24,0
much

75
00:31:24,0 --> 00:31:24,0
tribulation, the Lord

76
00:31:24,0 --> 00:31:24,0
did hear my

77
00:31:24,0 --> 00:31:24,0
cries, and did

78
00:31:24,0 --> 00:31:24,0
answer my

79
00:31:24,0 --> 00:31:24,0
prayers, and has

80
00:31:24,0 --> 00:31:24,0
made me an

81
00:31:24,0 --> 00:31:24,0
instrument in

82
00:31:24,0 --> 00:31:24,0
his hands in

83
00:31:24,0 --> 00:31:24,0
bringing so

84
00:31:24,0 --> 00:31:24,0
many of you to

85
00:31:24,0 --> 00:33:08,
a knowledge of his truth.

86
00:33:08,0 --> 00:33:08,0
11

87
00:33:08,0 --> 00:33:08,0
Nevertheless, in this I

88
00:33:08,0 --> 00:33:08,0
do not

89
00:33:08,0 --> 00:33:08,0
glory, for I am

90
00:33:08,0 --> 00:33:08,0
unworthy to

91
00:33:08,0 --> 00:37:51,
glory of myself.

92
00:37:51,0 --> 00:37:51,0
12 And now I

93
00:37:51,0 --> 00:37:51,0
say unto

94
00:37:51,0 --> 00:37:51,0
you, ye have

95
00:37:51,0 --> 00:37:51,0
been

96
00:37:51,0 --> 00:37:51,0
oppressed by king

97
00:37:51,0 --> 00:37:51,0
Noah, and have

98
00:37:51,0 --> 00:37:51,0
been in

99
00:37:51,0 --> 00:37:51,0
bondage to him

100
00:37:51,0 --> 00:37:51,0
and his

101
00:37:51,0 --> 00:37:51,0
priests, and

102
00:37:51,0 --> 00:37:51,0
have been

103
00:37:51,0 --> 00:37:51,0
brought into

104
00:37:51,0 --> 00:37:51,0
iniquity by

105
00:37:51,0 --> 00:37:51,0
them; therefore

106
00:37:51,0 --> 00:37:51,0
ye were

107
00:37:51,0 --> 00:37:51,0
bound with the

108
00:37:51,0 --> 00:37:23,
bands of iniquity.

109
00:37:23,0 --> 00:37:23,0
13 And now

110
00:37:23,0 --> 00:37:23,0
as ye have

111
00:37:23,0 --> 00:37:23,0
been

112
00:37:23,0 --> 00:37:23,0
delivered by the

113
00:37:23,0 --> 00:37:23,0
power of

114
00:37:23,0 --> 00:37:23,0
God out of

115
00:37:23,0 --> 00:37:23,0
these bonds;

116
00:37:23,0 --> 00:37:23,0
yea, even

117
00:37:23,0 --> 00:37:23,0
out of the

118
00:37:23,0 --> 00:37:23,0
hands of

119
00:37:23,0 --> 00:37:23,0
king Noah and

120
00:37:23,0 --> 00:37:23,0
his people,

121
00:37:23,0 --> 00:37:23,0
and also

122
00:37:23,0 --> 00:37:23,0
from the

123
00:37:23,0 --> 00:37:23,0
bonds of

124
00:37:23,0 --> 00:37:23,0
iniquity, even

125
00:37:23,0 --> 00:37:23,0
so I desire

126
00:37:23,0 --> 00:37:23,0
that ye

127
00:37:23,0 --> 00:37:23,0
should stand

128
00:37:23,0 --> 00:37:23,0
fast in this

129
00:37:23,0 --> 00:37:23,0
liberty

130
00:37:23,0 --> 00:37:23,0
wherewith ye

131
00:37:23,0 --> 00:37:23,0
have been

132
00:37:23,0 --> 00:37:23,0
made free,

133
00:37:23,0 --> 00:37:23,0
and that ye

134
00:37:23,0 --> 00:36:55,
trust no man to be a king over you.

135
00:36:55,0 --> 00:36:55,0
14 And

136
00:36:55,0 --> 00:36:55,0
also trust no

137
00:36:55,0 --> 00:36:55,0
one to be

138
00:36:55,0 --> 00:36:55,0
your

139
00:36:55,0 --> 00:36:55,0
teacher nor

140
00:36:55,0 --> 00:36:55,0
your

141
00:36:55,0 --> 00:36:55,0
minister, except

142
00:36:55,0 --> 00:36:55,0
he be a

143
00:36:55,0 --> 00:36:55,0
man of God,

144
00:36:55,0 --> 00:36:55,0
walking in

145
00:36:55,0 --> 00:36:55,0
his ways

146
00:36:55,0 --> 00:36:55,0
and

147
00:36:55,0 --> 00:36:27,
keeping his commandments.

148
00:36:27,0 --> 00:36:27,0
15 Thus

149
00:36:27,0 --> 00:36:27,0
did Alma

150
00:36:27,0 --> 00:36:27,0
teach his

151
00:36:27,0 --> 00:36:27,0
people,

152
00:36:27,0 --> 00:36:27,0
that every

153
00:36:27,0 --> 00:36:27,0
man

154
00:36:27,0 --> 00:36:27,0
should love

155
00:36:27,0 --> 00:36:27,0
his

156
00:36:27,0 --> 00:36:27,0
neighbor as

157
00:36:27,0 --> 00:36:27,0
himself,

158
00:36:27,0 --> 00:36:27,0
that there

159
00:36:27,0 --> 00:36:27,0
should be

160
00:36:27,0 --> 00:36:27,0
no

161
00:36:27,0 --> 00:35:59,
contention among them.

162
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
16 And

163
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
now, Alma

164
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
was

165
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
their high

166
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
priest,

167
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
he being

168
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
the

169
00:35:59,0 --> 00:35:59,0
founder of

170
00:35:59,0 --> 00:36:29,
their church.

171
00:36:29,0 --> 00:36:29,0
17 And

172
00:36:29,0 --> 00:36:29,0
it came

173
00:36:29,0 --> 00:36:29,0
to

174
00:36:29,0 --> 00:36:29,0
pass that

175
00:36:29,0 --> 00:36:29,0
none

176
00:36:29,0 --> 00:36:29,0
received

177
00:36:29,0 --> 00:36:29,0


178
00:36:29,0 --> 00:36:29,0
authority to

179
00:36:29,0 --> 00:36:29,0
preach

180
00:36:29,0 --> 00:36:29,0
or to

181
00:36:29,0 --> 00:36:29,0
teach

182
00:36:29,0 --> 00:36:29,0
except it

183
00:36:29,0 --> 00:36:29,0
were by

184
00:36:29,0 --> 00:36:29,0
him

185
00:36:29,0 --> 00:36:29,0
from God.

186
00:36:29,0 --> 00:36:29,0


187
00:36:29,0 --> 00:36:29,0
Therefore he

188
00:36:29,0 --> 00:36:29,0


189
00:36:29,0 --> 00:36:29,0
consecrated

190
00:36:29,0 --> 00:36:29,0
all their

191
00:36:29,0 --> 00:36:29,0


192
00:36:29,0 --> 00:36:29,0
priests and

193
00:36:29,0 --> 00:36:29,0
all

194
00:36:29,0 --> 00:36:29,0
their

195
00:36:29,0 --> 00:36:29,0
teachers;

196
00:36:29,0 --> 00:36:29,0
and none

197
00:36:29,0 --> 00:36:29,0
were

198
00:36:29,0 --> 00:36:29,0


199
00:36:29,0 --> 00:36:01,
consecrated except they were just men.

200
00:36:01,0 --> 00:36:01,0
18

201
00:36:01,0 --> 00:36:01,0
Therefore

202
00:36:01,0 --> 00:36:01,0
they

203
00:36:01,0 --> 00:36:01,0
did

204
00:36:01,0 --> 00:36:01,0
watch

205
00:36:01,0 --> 00:36:01,0
over

206
00:36:01,0 --> 00:36:01,0
their

207
00:36:01,0 --> 00:36:01,0
people,

208
00:36:01,0 --> 00:36:01,0
and did

209
00:36:01,0 --> 00:36:01,0


210
00:36:01,0 --> 00:36:01,0
nourish

211
00:36:01,0 --> 00:36:01,0
them with

212
00:36:01,0 --> 00:36:01,0


213
00:36:01,0 --> 00:36:01,0
things

214
00:36:01,0 --> 00:36:01,0
pertaining

215
00:36:01,0 --> 00:37:13,
to righteousness.

216
00:37:13,0 --> 00:37:13,0
19

217
00:37:13,0 --> 00:37:13,0
And it

218
00:37:13,0 --> 00:37:13,0
came

219
00:37:13,0 --> 00:37:13,0
to

220
00:37:13,0 --> 00:37:13,0
pass

221
00:37:13,0 --> 00:37:13,0
that

222
00:37:13,0 --> 00:37:13,0
they

223
00:37:13,0 --> 00:37:13,0
began

224
00:37:13,0 --> 00:37:13,0
to

225
00:37:13,0 --> 00:37:13,0
prosper

226
00:37:13,0 --> 00:37:13,0


227
00:37:13,0 --> 00:37:13,0


228
00:37:13,0 --> 00:37:13,0
exceedingly in

229
00:37:13,0 --> 00:37:13,0
