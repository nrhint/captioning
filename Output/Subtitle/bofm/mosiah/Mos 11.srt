00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:02,4
Chapter 11 King Noah rules in

2
00:00:02,4 --> 00:00:04,8
wickedness—He revels in riotous living with his wives

3
00:00:04,8 --> 00:00:07,2
and concubines—Abinadi prophesies that the

4
00:00:07,2 --> 00:00:09,6
people will be taken into bondage—His

5
00:00:09,6 --> 00:00:12,379
life is sought by King Noah. About 160–150 B.C. 

6
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:12,179
1 And now it came to pass that

7
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:11,979
Zeniff conferred the kingdom upon Noah,

8
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:11,779
one of his sons; therefore Noah

9
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:11,579
began to reign in his stead; and he

10
00:00:11,579 --> 00:00:11,445
did not walk in the ways of his father.

11
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:15,778
2 For behold, he did not keep the

12
00:00:15,778 --> 00:00:20,111
commandments of God, but he did

13
00:00:20,111 --> 00:00:24,444
walk after the desires of his own

14
00:00:24,444 --> 00:00:28,777
heart. And he had many wives and

15
00:00:28,777 --> 00:00:33,11
concubines. And he did cause his

16
00:00:33,11 --> 00:00:37,443
people to commit sin, and do that

17
00:00:37,443 --> 00:00:41,776
which was abominable in the sight of

18
00:00:41,776 --> 00:00:46,109
the Lord. Yea, and they did commit

19
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:50,851
whoredoms and all manner of wickedness.

20
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:50,74
3 And he laid a tax of one

21
00:00:50,74 --> 00:00:50,629
fifth part of all they possessed,

22
00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:50,518
a fifth part of their gold

23
00:00:50,518 --> 00:00:50,407
and of their silver, and a fifth

24
00:00:50,407 --> 00:00:50,296
part of their ziff, and of

25
00:00:50,296 --> 00:00:50,185
their copper, and of their brass

26
00:00:50,185 --> 00:00:50,074
and their iron; and a fifth

27
00:00:50,074 --> 00:00:49,963
part of their fatlings; and

28
00:00:49,963 --> 00:00:49,917
also a fifth part of all their grain.

29
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:50,631
4 And all this did he take

30
00:00:50,631 --> 00:00:51,345
to support himself, and

31
00:00:51,345 --> 00:00:52,059
his wives and his

32
00:00:52,059 --> 00:00:52,773
concubines; and also his priests,

33
00:00:52,773 --> 00:00:53,487
and their wives and their

34
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:54,201
concubines; thus he had

35
00:00:54,201 --> 00:00:54,321
changed the affairs of the kingdom.

36
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:55,607
5 For he put down all

37
00:00:55,607 --> 00:00:56,893
the priests that had been

38
00:00:56,893 --> 00:00:58,179
consecrated by his

39
00:00:58,179 --> 00:00:59,465
father, and consecrated new

40
00:00:59,465 --> 00:01:00,751
ones in their stead, such

41
00:01:00,751 --> 00:01:02,037
as were lifted up in

42
00:01:02,037 --> 00:01:03,297
the pride of their hearts.

43
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:03,186
6 Yea, and thus they

44
00:01:03,186 --> 00:01:03,075
were supported in their

45
00:01:03,075 --> 00:01:02,964
laziness, and in their

46
00:01:02,964 --> 00:01:02,853
idolatry, and in their

47
00:01:02,853 --> 00:01:02,742
whoredoms, by the taxes

48
00:01:02,742 --> 00:01:02,631
which king Noah had put

49
00:01:02,631 --> 00:01:02,52
upon his people; thus

50
00:01:02,52 --> 00:01:02,409
did the people labor

51
00:01:02,409 --> 00:01:02,829
exceedingly to support iniquity.

52
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:03,829
7 Yea, and they also

53
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:04,829
became idolatrous,

54
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:05,829
because they were

55
00:01:05,829 --> 00:01:06,829
deceived by the vain and

56
00:01:06,829 --> 00:01:07,829
flattering words of

57
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:08,829
the king and priests;

58
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:09,829
for they did speak

59
00:01:09,829 --> 00:01:10,804
flattering things unto them.

60
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:11,387
8 And it came to

61
00:01:11,387 --> 00:01:11,97
pass that king Noah

62
00:01:11,97 --> 00:01:12,553
built many elegant and

63
00:01:12,553 --> 00:01:13,136
spacious buildings;

64
00:01:13,136 --> 00:01:13,719
and he ornamented

65
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:14,302
them with fine work of

66
00:01:14,302 --> 00:01:14,885
wood, and of all

67
00:01:14,885 --> 00:01:15,468
manner of precious

68
00:01:15,468 --> 00:01:16,051
things, of gold, and of

69
00:01:16,051 --> 00:01:16,634
silver, and of

70
00:01:16,634 --> 00:01:17,217
iron, and of brass, and

71
00:01:17,217 --> 00:01:17,844
of ziff, and of copper;

72
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:17,733
9 And he also built

73
00:01:17,733 --> 00:01:17,622
him a spacious

74
00:01:17,622 --> 00:01:17,511
palace, and a throne

75
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:17,4
in the midst

76
00:01:17,4 --> 00:01:17,289
thereof, all of which was

77
00:01:17,289 --> 00:01:17,178
of fine wood and

78
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:17,067
was ornamented with

79
00:01:17,067 --> 00:01:16,956
gold and silver and

80
00:01:16,956 --> 00:01:16,91
with precious things.

81
00:01:16,91 --> 00:01:20,66
10 And he also

82
00:01:20,66 --> 00:01:24,41
caused that his

83
00:01:24,41 --> 00:01:28,16
workmen should work all

84
00:01:28,16 --> 00:01:31,91
manner of fine

85
00:01:31,91 --> 00:01:35,66
work within the

86
00:01:35,66 --> 00:01:39,41
walls of the temple,

87
00:01:39,41 --> 00:01:43,16
of fine wood, and

88
00:01:43,16 --> 00:01:46,673
of copper, and of brass.

89
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:46,791
11 And the seats

90
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:46,909
which were set

91
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:47,027
apart for the high

92
00:01:47,027 --> 00:01:47,145
priests, which

93
00:01:47,145 --> 00:01:47,263
were above all the

94
00:01:47,263 --> 00:01:47,381
other seats, he

95
00:01:47,381 --> 00:01:47,499
did ornament with

96
00:01:47,499 --> 00:01:47,617
pure gold; and he

97
00:01:47,617 --> 00:01:47,735
caused a

98
00:01:47,735 --> 00:01:47,853
breastwork to be built

99
00:01:47,853 --> 00:01:47,971
before them, that

100
00:01:47,971 --> 00:01:48,089
they might rest

101
00:01:48,089 --> 00:01:48,207
their bodies and

102
00:01:48,207 --> 00:01:48,325
their arms upon

103
00:01:48,325 --> 00:01:48,443
while they should

104
00:01:48,443 --> 00:01:48,561
speak lying and

105
00:01:48,561 --> 00:01:48,141
vain words to his people.

106
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:48,585
12 And it came

107
00:01:48,585 --> 00:01:49,029
to pass that he

108
00:01:49,029 --> 00:01:49,473
built a tower

109
00:01:49,473 --> 00:01:49,917
near the temple;

110
00:01:49,917 --> 00:01:50,361
yea, a very high

111
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:50,805
tower, even so

112
00:01:50,805 --> 00:01:51,249
high that he could

113
00:01:51,249 --> 00:01:51,693
stand upon the

114
00:01:51,693 --> 00:01:52,137
top thereof and

115
00:01:52,137 --> 00:01:52,581
overlook the

116
00:01:52,581 --> 00:01:53,025
land of Shilom, and

117
00:01:53,025 --> 00:01:53,469
also the land

118
00:01:53,469 --> 00:01:53,913
of Shemlon, which

119
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:54,357
was possessed

120
00:01:54,357 --> 00:01:54,801
by the Lamanites;

121
00:01:54,801 --> 00:01:55,245
and he could

122
00:01:55,245 --> 00:01:55,689
even look over all

123
00:01:55,689 --> 00:01:56,116
the land round about.

124
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:56,259
13 And it came

125
00:01:56,259 --> 00:01:56,402
to pass that he

126
00:01:56,402 --> 00:01:56,545
caused many

127
00:01:56,545 --> 00:01:56,688
buildings to be

128
00:01:56,688 --> 00:01:56,831
built in the

129
00:01:56,831 --> 00:01:56,974
land Shilom; and

130
00:01:56,974 --> 00:01:57,117
he caused a

131
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:57,26
great tower to be

132
00:01:57,26 --> 00:01:57,403
built on the

133
00:01:57,403 --> 00:01:57,546
hill north of the

134
00:01:57,546 --> 00:01:57,689
land Shilom,

135
00:01:57,689 --> 00:01:57,832
which had been a

136
00:01:57,832 --> 00:01:57,975
resort for the

137
00:01:57,975 --> 00:01:58,118
children of

138
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:58,261
Nephi at the time

139
00:01:58,261 --> 00:01:58,404
they fled out

140
00:01:58,404 --> 00:01:58,547
of the land; and

141
00:01:58,547 --> 00:01:58,69
thus he did do

142
00:01:58,69 --> 00:01:58,833
with the

143
00:01:58,833 --> 00:01:58,976
riches which he

144
00:01:58,976 --> 00:01:59,586
obtained by the taxation of his people.

145
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:02,229
14 And it came

146
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:04,872
to pass that

147
00:02:04,872 --> 00:02:07,515
he placed his

148
00:02:07,515 --> 00:02:10,158
heart upon his

149
00:02:10,158 --> 00:02:12,801
riches, and

150
00:02:12,801 --> 00:02:15,444
he spent his

151
00:02:15,444 --> 00:02:18,087
time in riotous

152
00:02:18,087 --> 00:02:20,73
living with

153
00:02:20,73 --> 00:02:23,373
his wives and

154
00:02:23,373 --> 00:02:26,016
his concubines;

155
00:02:26,016 --> 00:02:28,659
and so did

156
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:31,302
also his priests

157
00:02:31,302 --> 00:02:33,945
spend their

158
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,857
time with harlots.

159
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:38,0
15 And it

160
00:02:38,0 --> 00:02:41,143
came to pass

161
00:02:41,143 --> 00:02:43,286
that he planted

162
00:02:43,286 --> 00:02:45,429
vineyards

163
00:02:45,429 --> 00:02:47,572
round about in

164
00:02:47,572 --> 00:02:49,715
the land; and

165
00:02:49,715 --> 00:02:51,858
he built

166
00:02:51,858 --> 00:02:54,001
wine-presses, and

167
00:02:54,001 --> 00:02:56,144
made wine in

168
00:02:56,144 --> 00:02:58,287
abundance;

169
00:02:58,287 --> 00:03:00,43
and therefore

170
00:03:00,43 --> 00:03:02,573
he became a

171
00:03:02,573 --> 00:03:04,716
wine-bibber,

172
00:03:04,716 --> 00:03:06,153
and also his people.

173
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:06,367
16 And it

174
00:03:06,367 --> 00:03:06,581
came to pass

175
00:03:06,581 --> 00:03:06,795
that the

176
00:03:06,795 --> 00:03:07,009
Lamanites began

177
00:03:07,009 --> 00:03:07,223
to come in

178
00:03:07,223 --> 00:03:07,437
upon his

179
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:07,651
people, upon

180
00:03:07,651 --> 00:03:07,865
small numbers,

181
00:03:07,865 --> 00:03:08,079
and to slay

182
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:08,293
them in

183
00:03:08,293 --> 00:03:08,507
their fields,

184
00:03:08,507 --> 00:03:08,721
and while they

185
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:08,935
were

186
00:03:08,935 --> 00:03:09,623
tending their flocks.

187
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:09,915
17 And king

188
00:03:09,915 --> 00:03:10,207
Noah sent

189
00:03:10,207 --> 00:03:10,499
guards round

190
00:03:10,499 --> 00:03:10,791
about the

191
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:11,083
land to keep

192
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:11,375
them off; but

193
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:11,667
he did not

194
00:03:11,667 --> 00:03:11,959
send a

195
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:12,251
sufficient number,

196
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:12,543
and the

197
00:03:12,543 --> 00:03:12,835
Lamanites came

198
00:03:12,835 --> 00:03:13,127
upon them

199
00:03:13,127 --> 00:03:13,419
and killed

200
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:13,711
them, and drove

201
00:03:13,711 --> 00:03:14,003
many of

202
00:03:14,003 --> 00:03:14,295
their flocks

203
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:14,587
out of the

204
00:03:14,587 --> 00:03:14,879
land; thus the

205
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:15,171
Lamanites

206
00:03:15,171 --> 00:03:15,463
began to

207
00:03:15,463 --> 00:03:15,755
destroy them, and

208
00:03:15,755 --> 00:03:16,047
to exercise

209
00:03:16,047 --> 00:03:16,339
their

210
00:03:16,339 --> 00:03:16,663
hatred upon them.

211
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:17,163
18 And it

212
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:17,663
came to pass

213
00:03:17,663 --> 00:03:18,163
that king

214
00:03:18,163 --> 00:03:18,663
Noah sent

215
00:03:18,663 --> 00:03:19,163
his armies

216
00:03:19,163 --> 00:03:19,663
against

217
00:03:19,663 --> 00:03:20,163
them, and they

218
00:03:20,163 --> 00:03:20,663
were driven

219
00:03:20,663 --> 00:03:21,163
back, or

220
00:03:21,163 --> 00:03:21,663
they drove

221
00:03:21,663 --> 00:03:22,163
them back

222
00:03:22,163 --> 00:03:22,663
for a time;

223
00:03:22,663 --> 00:03:23,163
therefore,

224
00:03:23,163 --> 00:03:23,663
they

225
00:03:23,663 --> 00:03:24,163
returned rejoicing

226
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:24,638
in their spoil.

227
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:24,941
19 And now,

228
00:03:24,941 --> 00:03:25,244
because of

229
00:03:25,244 --> 00:03:25,547
this great

230
00:03:25,547 --> 00:03:25,85
victory

231
00:03:25,85 --> 00:03:26,153
they were

232
00:03:26,153 --> 00:03:26,456
lifted up in

233
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:26,759
the pride of

234
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:27,062
their

235
00:03:27,062 --> 00:03:27,365
hearts; they

236
00:03:27,365 --> 00:03:27,668
did boast in

237
00:03:27,668 --> 00:03:27,971
their own

238
00:03:27,971 --> 00:03:28,274
strength,

239
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:28,577
saying that

240
00:03:28,577 --> 00:03:28,88
their fifty

241
00:03:28,88 --> 00:03:29,183
could stand

242
00:03:29,183 --> 00:03:29,486
against

243
00:03:29,486 --> 00:03:29,789
thousands of

244
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:30,092
the

245
00:03:30,092 --> 00:03:30,395
Lamanites; and

246
00:03:30,395 --> 00:03:30,698
thus they did

247
00:03:30,698 --> 00:03:31,001
boast, and

248
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:31,304
did delight

249
00:03:31,304 --> 00:03:31,607
in blood,

250
00:03:31,607 --> 00:03:31,91
and the

251
00:03:31,91 --> 00:03:32,213
shedding of

252
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:32,516
the blood of

253
00:03:32,516 --> 00:03:32,819
their

254
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:33,122
brethren, and

255
00:03:33,122 --> 00:03:33,425
this because

256
00:03:33,425 --> 00:03:33,728
of the

257
00:03:33,728 --> 00:03:34,031
wickedness of

258
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:34,334
their king

259
00:03:34,334 --> 00:03:34,548
and priests.

260
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:34,651
20 And it

261
00:03:34,651 --> 00:03:34,754
came to

262
00:03:34,754 --> 00:03:34,857
pass that

263
00:03:34,857 --> 00:03:34,96
there was a

264
00:03:34,96 --> 00:03:35,063
man among

265
00:03:35,063 --> 00:03:35,166
them whose

266
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:35,269
name was

267
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:35,372
Abinadi;

268
00:03:35,372 --> 00:03:35,475
and he went

269
00:03:35,475 --> 00:03:35,578
forth

270
00:03:35,578 --> 00:03:35,681
among them,

271
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:35,784
and began

272
00:03:35,784 --> 00:03:35,887
to

273
00:03:35,887 --> 00:03:35,99
prophesy, saying:

274
00:03:35,99 --> 00:03:36,093
Behold,

275
00:03:36,093 --> 00:03:36,196
thus saith

276
00:03:36,196 --> 00:03:36,299
the Lord,

277
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:36,402
and thus

278
00:03:36,402 --> 00:03:36,505
hath he

279
00:03:36,505 --> 00:03:36,608
commanded me,

280
00:03:36,608 --> 00:03:36,711
saying, Go

281
00:03:36,711 --> 00:03:36,814
forth,

282
00:03:36,814 --> 00:03:36,917
and say unto

283
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:37,02
this

284
00:03:37,02 --> 00:03:37,123
people, thus

285
00:03:37,123 --> 00:03:37,226
saith the

286
00:03:37,226 --> 00:03:37,329
Lord—Wo be

287
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:37,432
unto this

288
00:03:37,432 --> 00:03:37,535
people,

289
00:03:37,535 --> 00:03:37,638
for I have

290
00:03:37,638 --> 00:03:37,741
seen their

291
00:03:37,741 --> 00:03:37,844


292
00:03:37,844 --> 00:03:37,947
abominations, and

293
00:03:37,947 --> 00:03:38,05
their

294
00:03:38,05 --> 00:03:38,153
wickedness, and

295
00:03:38,153 --> 00:03:38,256
their

296
00:03:38,256 --> 00:03:38,359
whoredoms; and

297
00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:38,462
except

298
00:03:38,462 --> 00:03:38,018
they repent I will visit them in mine anger.

299
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:38,714
21 And

300
00:03:38,714 --> 00:03:39,41
except they

301
00:03:39,41 --> 00:03:40,106
repent

302
00:03:40,106 --> 00:03:40,802
and turn

303
00:03:40,802 --> 00:03:41,498
to the

304
00:03:41,498 --> 00:03:42,194
Lord their

305
00:03:42,194 --> 00:03:42,89
God,

306
00:03:42,89 --> 00:03:43,586
behold, I will

307
00:03:43,586 --> 00:03:44,282
deliver

308
00:03:44,282 --> 00:03:44,978
them into

309
00:03:44,978 --> 00:03:45,674
the

310
00:03:45,674 --> 00:03:46,37
hands of

311
00:03:46,37 --> 00:03:47,066
their

312
00:03:47,066 --> 00:03:47,762
enemies; yea,

313
00:03:47,762 --> 00:03:48,458
and they

314
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:49,154
shall be

315
00:03:49,154 --> 00:03:49,85
brought

316
00:03:49,85 --> 00:03:50,546
into

317
00:03:50,546 --> 00:03:51,242
bondage; and

318
00:03:51,242 --> 00:03:51,938
they shall

319
00:03:51,938 --> 00:03:52,634
be

320
00:03:52,634 --> 00:03:53,33
afflicted by the

321
00:03:53,33 --> 00:03:54,935
hand of their enemies.

322
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:56,497
22 And

323
00:03:56,497 --> 00:03:58,059
it shall

pass

326
00:04:01,183 --> 00:04:02,745
that they

327
00:04:02,745 --> 00:04:04,307

know that I

329
00:04:05,869 --> 00:04:07,431
am the

their God,

332
00:04:10,555 --> 00:04:12,117
and am a

00:04:15,241 --> 00:04:16,803
visiting

336
00:04:16,803 --> 00:04:18,365
the

337
00:04:18,365 --> 00:04:19,86
iniquities of my people.

338
00:04:19,86 --> 00:04:20,78
23 And

339
00:04:20,78 --> 00:04:21,7
it

340
00:04:21,7 --> 00:04:22,62

00:04:41,02 --> 00:04:41,94
except it

362
00:04:41,94 --> 00:04:42,115

24

364
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:42,915
Yea, and

I

375
00:04:46,915 --> 00:04:47,315
will be

376
00:04:47,315 --> 00:04:47,715
slow to

387
00:04:51,715 --> 00:04:52,025

389
00:04:52,102 --> 00:04:52,179
And
