00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 11 King Noah rules in

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
wickedness—He revels in riotous living with his wives

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and concubines—Abinadi prophesies that the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
people will be taken into bondage—His

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:09:27,
life is sought by King Noah. About 160–150 B.C. 

6
00:09:27,0 --> 00:09:27,0
1 And now it came to pass that

7
00:09:27,0 --> 00:09:27,0
Zeniff conferred the kingdom upon Noah,

8
00:09:27,0 --> 00:09:27,0
one of his sons; therefore Noah

9
00:09:27,0 --> 00:09:27,0
began to reign in his stead; and he

10
00:09:27,0 --> 00:16:56,
did not walk in the ways of his father.

11
00:16:56,0 --> 00:16:56,0
2 For behold, he did not keep the

12
00:16:56,0 --> 00:16:56,0
commandments of God, but he did

13
00:16:56,0 --> 00:16:56,0
walk after the desires of his own

14
00:16:56,0 --> 00:16:56,0
heart. And he had many wives and

15
00:16:56,0 --> 00:16:56,0
concubines. And he did cause his

16
00:16:56,0 --> 00:16:56,0
people to commit sin, and do that

17
00:16:56,0 --> 00:16:56,0
which was abominable in the sight of

18
00:16:56,0 --> 00:16:56,0
the Lord. Yea, and they did commit

19
00:16:56,0 --> 00:22:38,
whoredoms and all manner of wickedness.

20
00:22:38,0 --> 00:22:38,0
3 And he laid a tax of one

21
00:22:38,0 --> 00:22:38,0
fifth part of all they possessed,

22
00:22:38,0 --> 00:22:38,0
a fifth part of their gold

23
00:22:38,0 --> 00:22:38,0
and of their silver, and a fifth

24
00:22:38,0 --> 00:22:38,0
part of their ziff, and of

25
00:22:38,0 --> 00:22:38,0
their copper, and of their brass

26
00:22:38,0 --> 00:22:38,0
and their iron; and a fifth

27
00:22:38,0 --> 00:22:38,0
part of their fatlings; and

28
00:22:38,0 --> 00:22:10,
also a fifth part of all their grain.

29
00:22:10,0 --> 00:22:10,0
4 And all this did he take

30
00:22:10,0 --> 00:22:10,0
to support himself, and

31
00:22:10,0 --> 00:22:10,0
his wives and his

32
00:22:10,0 --> 00:22:10,0
concubines; and also his priests,

33
00:22:10,0 --> 00:22:10,0
and their wives and their

34
00:22:10,0 --> 00:22:10,0
concubines; thus he had

35
00:22:10,0 --> 00:25:41,
changed the affairs of the kingdom.

36
00:25:41,0 --> 00:25:41,0
5 For he put down all

37
00:25:41,0 --> 00:25:41,0
the priests that had been

38
00:25:41,0 --> 00:25:41,0
consecrated by his

39
00:25:41,0 --> 00:25:41,0
father, and consecrated new

40
00:25:41,0 --> 00:25:41,0
ones in their stead, such

41
00:25:41,0 --> 00:25:41,0
as were lifted up in

42
00:25:41,0 --> 00:26:53,
the pride of their hearts.

43
00:26:53,0 --> 00:26:53,0
6 Yea, and thus they

44
00:26:53,0 --> 00:26:53,0
were supported in their

45
00:26:53,0 --> 00:26:53,0
laziness, and in their

46
00:26:53,0 --> 00:26:53,0
idolatry, and in their

47
00:26:53,0 --> 00:26:53,0
whoredoms, by the taxes

48
00:26:53,0 --> 00:26:53,0
which king Noah had put

49
00:26:53,0 --> 00:26:53,0
upon his people; thus

50
00:26:53,0 --> 00:26:53,0
did the people labor

51
00:26:53,0 --> 00:28:37,
exceedingly to support iniquity.

52
00:28:37,0 --> 00:28:37,0
7 Yea, and they also

53
00:28:37,0 --> 00:28:37,0
became idolatrous,

54
00:28:37,0 --> 00:28:37,0
because they were

55
00:28:37,0 --> 00:28:37,0
deceived by the vain and

56
00:28:37,0 --> 00:28:37,0
flattering words of

57
00:28:37,0 --> 00:28:37,0
the king and priests;

58
00:28:37,0 --> 00:28:37,0
for they did speak

59
00:28:37,0 --> 00:33:48,
flattering things unto them.

60
00:33:48,0 --> 00:33:48,0
8 And it came to

61
00:33:48,0 --> 00:33:48,0
pass that king Noah

62
00:33:48,0 --> 00:33:48,0
built many elegant and

63
00:33:48,0 --> 00:33:48,0
spacious buildings;

64
00:33:48,0 --> 00:33:48,0
and he ornamented

65
00:33:48,0 --> 00:33:48,0
them with fine work of

66
00:33:48,0 --> 00:33:48,0
wood, and of all

67
00:33:48,0 --> 00:33:48,0
manner of precious

68
00:33:48,0 --> 00:33:48,0
things, of gold, and of

69
00:33:48,0 --> 00:33:48,0
silver, and of

70
00:33:48,0 --> 00:33:48,0
iron, and of brass, and

71
00:33:48,0 --> 00:38:17,
of ziff, and of copper;

72
00:38:17,0 --> 00:38:17,0
9 And he also built

73
00:38:17,0 --> 00:38:17,0
him a spacious

74
00:38:17,0 --> 00:38:17,0
palace, and a throne

75
00:38:17,0 --> 00:38:17,0
in the midst

76
00:38:17,0 --> 00:38:17,0
thereof, all of which was

77
00:38:17,0 --> 00:38:17,0
of fine wood and

78
00:38:17,0 --> 00:38:17,0
was ornamented with

79
00:38:17,0 --> 00:38:17,0
gold and silver and

80
00:38:17,0 --> 00:37:49,
with precious things.

81
00:37:49,0 --> 00:37:49,0
10 And he also

82
00:37:49,0 --> 00:37:49,0
caused that his

83
00:37:49,0 --> 00:37:49,0
workmen should work all

84
00:37:49,0 --> 00:37:49,0
manner of fine

85
00:37:49,0 --> 00:37:49,0
work within the

86
00:37:49,0 --> 00:37:49,0
walls of the temple,

87
00:37:49,0 --> 00:37:49,0
of fine wood, and

88
00:37:49,0 --> 00:37:21,
of copper, and of brass.

89
00:37:21,0 --> 00:37:21,0
11 And the seats

90
00:37:21,0 --> 00:37:21,0
which were set

91
00:37:21,0 --> 00:37:21,0
apart for the high

92
00:37:21,0 --> 00:37:21,0
priests, which

93
00:37:21,0 --> 00:37:21,0
were above all the

94
00:37:21,0 --> 00:37:21,0
other seats, he

95
00:37:21,0 --> 00:37:21,0
did ornament with

96
00:37:21,0 --> 00:37:21,0
pure gold; and he

97
00:37:21,0 --> 00:37:21,0
caused a

98
00:37:21,0 --> 00:37:21,0
breastwork to be built

99
00:37:21,0 --> 00:37:21,0
before them, that

100
00:37:21,0 --> 00:37:21,0
they might rest

101
00:37:21,0 --> 00:37:21,0
their bodies and

102
00:37:21,0 --> 00:37:21,0
their arms upon

103
00:37:21,0 --> 00:37:21,0
while they should

104
00:37:21,0 --> 00:37:21,0
speak lying and

105
00:37:21,0 --> 00:38:33,
vain words to his people.

106
00:38:33,0 --> 00:38:33,0
12 And it came

107
00:38:33,0 --> 00:38:33,0
to pass that he

108
00:38:33,0 --> 00:38:33,0
built a tower

109
00:38:33,0 --> 00:38:33,0
near the temple;

110
00:38:33,0 --> 00:38:33,0
yea, a very high

111
00:38:33,0 --> 00:38:33,0
tower, even so

112
00:38:33,0 --> 00:38:33,0
high that he could

113
00:38:33,0 --> 00:38:33,0
stand upon the

114
00:38:33,0 --> 00:38:33,0
top thereof and

115
00:38:33,0 --> 00:38:33,0
overlook the

116
00:38:33,0 --> 00:38:33,0
land of Shilom, and

117
00:38:33,0 --> 00:38:33,0
also the land

118
00:38:33,0 --> 00:38:33,0
of Shemlon, which

119
00:38:33,0 --> 00:38:33,0
was possessed

120
00:38:33,0 --> 00:38:33,0
by the Lamanites;

121
00:38:33,0 --> 00:38:33,0
and he could

122
00:38:33,0 --> 00:38:33,0
even look over all

123
00:38:33,0 --> 00:41:01,
the land round about.

124
00:41:01,0 --> 00:41:01,0
13 And it came

125
00:41:01,0 --> 00:41:01,0
to pass that he

126
00:41:01,0 --> 00:41:01,0
caused many

127
00:41:01,0 --> 00:41:01,0
buildings to be

128
00:41:01,0 --> 00:41:01,0
built in the

129
00:41:01,0 --> 00:41:01,0
land Shilom; and

130
00:41:01,0 --> 00:41:01,0
he caused a

131
00:41:01,0 --> 00:41:01,0
great tower to be

132
00:41:01,0 --> 00:41:01,0
built on the

133
00:41:01,0 --> 00:41:01,0
hill north of the

134
00:41:01,0 --> 00:41:01,0
land Shilom,

135
00:41:01,0 --> 00:41:01,0
which had been a

136
00:41:01,0 --> 00:41:01,0
resort for the

137
00:41:01,0 --> 00:41:01,0
children of

138
00:41:01,0 --> 00:41:01,0
Nephi at the time

139
00:41:01,0 --> 00:41:01,0
they fled out

140
00:41:01,0 --> 00:41:01,0
of the land; and

141
00:41:01,0 --> 00:41:01,0
thus he did do

142
00:41:01,0 --> 00:41:01,0
with the

143
00:41:01,0 --> 00:41:01,0
riches which he

144
00:41:01,0 --> 00:42:13,
obtained by the taxation of his people.

145
00:42:13,0 --> 00:42:13,0
14 And it came

146
00:42:13,0 --> 00:42:13,0
to pass that

147
00:42:13,0 --> 00:42:13,0
he placed his

148
00:42:13,0 --> 00:42:13,0
heart upon his

149
00:42:13,0 --> 00:42:13,0
riches, and

150
00:42:13,0 --> 00:42:13,0
he spent his

151
00:42:13,0 --> 00:42:13,0
time in riotous

152
00:42:13,0 --> 00:42:13,0
living with

153
00:42:13,0 --> 00:42:13,0
his wives and

154
00:42:13,0 --> 00:42:13,0
his concubines;

155
00:42:13,0 --> 00:42:13,0
and so did

156
00:42:13,0 --> 00:42:13,0
also his priests

157
00:42:13,0 --> 00:42:13,0
spend their

158
00:42:13,0 --> 00:43:11,
time with harlots.

159
00:43:11,0 --> 00:43:11,0
15 And it

160
00:43:11,0 --> 00:43:11,0
came to pass

161
00:43:11,0 --> 00:43:11,0
that he planted

162
00:43:11,0 --> 00:43:11,0
vineyards

163
00:43:11,0 --> 00:43:11,0
round about in

164
00:43:11,0 --> 00:43:11,0
the land; and

165
00:43:11,0 --> 00:43:11,0
he built

166
00:43:11,0 --> 00:43:11,0
wine-presses, and

167
00:43:11,0 --> 00:43:11,0
made wine in

168
00:43:11,0 --> 00:43:11,0
abundance;

169
00:43:11,0 --> 00:43:11,0
and therefore

170
00:43:11,0 --> 00:43:11,0
he became a

171
00:43:11,0 --> 00:43:11,0
wine-bibber,

172
00:43:11,0 --> 01:01:04,
and also his people.

173
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
16 And it

174
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
came to pass

175
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
that the

176
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
Lamanites began

177
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
to come in

178
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
upon his

179
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
people, upon

180
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
small numbers,

181
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
and to slay

182
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
them in

183
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
their fields,

184
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
and while they

185
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
were

186
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,
tending their flocks.

187
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
17 And king

188
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
Noah sent

189
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
guards round

190
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
about the

191
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
land to keep

192
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
them off; but

193
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
he did not

194
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
send a

195
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
sufficient number,

196
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
and the

197
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
Lamanites came

198
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
upon them

199
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
and killed

200
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
them, and drove

201
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
many of

202
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
their flocks

203
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
out of the

204
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
land; thus the

205
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
Lamanites

206
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
began to

207
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
destroy them, and

208
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
to exercise

209
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
their

210
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,
hatred upon them.

211
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
18 And it

212
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
came to pass

213
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
that king

214
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
Noah sent

215
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
his armies

216
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
against

217
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
them, and they

218
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
were driven

219
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
back, or

220
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
they drove

221
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
them back

222
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
for a time;

223
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
therefore,

224
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
they

225
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
returned rejoicing

226
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,
in their spoil.

227
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
19 And now,

228
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
because of

229
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
this great

230
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
victory

231
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
they were

232
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
lifted up in

233
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
the pride of

234
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
their

235
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
hearts; they

236
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
did boast in

237
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
their own

238
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
strength,

239
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
saying that

240
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
their fifty

241
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
could stand

242
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
against

243
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
thousands of

244
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
the

245
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
Lamanites; and

246
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
thus they did

247
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
boast, and

248
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
did delight

249
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
in blood,

250
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
and the

251
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
shedding of

252
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
the blood of

253
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
their

254
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
brethren, and

255
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
this because

256
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
of the

257
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
wickedness of

258
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
their king

259
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,
and priests.

260
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
20 And it

261
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
came to

262
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
pass that

263
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
there was a

264
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
man among

265
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
them whose

266
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
name was

267
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
Abinadi;

268
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
and he went

269
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
forth

270
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
among them,

271
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
and began

272
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
to

273
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
prophesy, saying:

274
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
Behold,

275
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
thus saith

276
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
the Lord,

277
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
and thus

278
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
hath he

279
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
commanded me,

280
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
saying, Go

281
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
forth,

282
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
and say unto

283
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
this

284
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
people, thus

285
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
saith the

286
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
Lord—Wo be

287
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
unto this

288
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
people,

289
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
for I have

290
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
seen their

291
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0


292
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
abominations, and

293
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
their

294
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
wickedness, and

295
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
their

296
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
whoredoms; and

297
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
except

298
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,
they repent I will visit them in mine anger.

299
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
21 And

300
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
except they

301
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
repent

302
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
and turn

303
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
to the

304
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
Lord their

305
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
God,

306
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
behold, I will

307
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
deliver

308
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
them into

309
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
the

310
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
hands of

311
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
their

312
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
enemies; yea,

313
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
and they

314
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
shall be

315
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
brought

316
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
into

317
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
bondage; and

318
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
they shall

319
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
be

320
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
afflicted by the

321
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,
hand of their enemies.

322
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
22 And

323
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
it shall

324
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
come to

325
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
pass

326
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
that they

327
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
shall

328
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
know that I

329
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
am the

330
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
Lord

331
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
their God,

332
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
and am a

333
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
jealous

334
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
God,

335
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
visiting

336
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
the

337
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,
iniquities of my people.

338
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
23 And

339
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
it

340
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
shall come

341
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
to pass

01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
that

01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
people

346
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
repent and

01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
turn

348
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
unto the

01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
none

358
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0

01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
deliver

360
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
them,

361
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
except it

362
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,
be the Lord the Almighty God.

363
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
24

364
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
Yea, and

365
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
it

366
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0

01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
that

370
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
when they

cry

373
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
unto me

374
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
I

375
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
will be

376
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
slow to

377
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
hear

378
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
their

379
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
cries;

01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
yea,

381
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
and I

382
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
will

383
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
suffer

384
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
them

385
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
that

386
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
they be

387
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,
smitten by their enemies.

388
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
25

389
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
And

390
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
except

391
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
they

392
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
repent

393
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
in

394
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0


395
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
sackcloth

396
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
and

397
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
ashes,

398
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
and

01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
cry

400
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0


401
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
mightily to

402
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
the

403
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
Lord

01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
God,

01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
I

407
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
will not

408

hear

409
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0


410
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
their

411
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
prayers,

412
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0


413
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
neither

414
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
will I

415
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0


416
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
deliver

417
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
them

418
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
out of

419
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0


420
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
their

421
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0


422
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
afflictions;

423
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
and

424
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
thus

425
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
saith

426
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,
the Lord, and thus hath he commanded me.

427
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
26

428
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
Now it

429
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
came

430
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
to

431
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
pass

432
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
that

433
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
when

434
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
Abinadi

435
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
had

436
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0


437
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
spoken

438
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
these

439
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
words

440
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
unto

441
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
them

442
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
they

443
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
were

444
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
wroth

445
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
with

446
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
him,

447
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
and

448
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
sought

449
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
to

450
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
take

451
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
away

452
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
his

453
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
life;

454
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
but

455
01:01:04,0 --> 01:01:04,0
the

456
