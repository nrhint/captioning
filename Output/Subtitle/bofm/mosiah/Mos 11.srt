00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,4
Chapter 11 King Noah rules in wickedness—He revels

2
00:00:01,4 --> 00:00:02,8
 in riotous living with his wives and

3
00:00:02,8 --> 00:00:04,2
 concubines—Abinadi prophesies that the people will be taken

4
00:00:04,2 --> 00:00:05,6
 into bondage—His life is sought by King Noah. About

5
00:00:05,6 --> 00:00:07,0
 160–150 B.C.

6
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,975
1 And now it came to pass that Zeniff conferred

7
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:11,975
 the kingdom upon Noah, one of his sons; therefore

8
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:13,975
 Noah began to reign in his stead; and he did not

9
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:15,975
 walk in the ways of his father

10
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,092
2 For behold, he did not keep the commandments of

11
00:00:17,092 --> 00:00:18,235
 God, but he did walk after the desires of his own

12
00:00:18,235 --> 00:00:19,378
 heart. And he had many wives and concubines. And

13
00:00:19,378 --> 00:00:20,521
 he did cause his people to commit sin, and do that

14
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:21,664
 which was abominable in the sight of the Lord.

15
00:00:21,664 --> 00:00:22,807
 Yea, and they did commit whoredoms and all manner of

16
00:00:22,807 --> 00:00:23,95
 wickedness

17
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:26,591
3 And he laid a tax of one fifth part of all they

18
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:29,258
 possessed, a fifth part of their gold and of their

19
00:00:29,258 --> 00:00:31,925
 silver, and a fifth part of their ziff, and of

20
00:00:31,925 --> 00:00:34,592
 their copper, and of their brass and their iron; and

21
00:00:34,592 --> 00:00:37,259
 a fifth part of their fatlings; and also a fifth

22
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:39,926
 part of all their grain

23
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:43,873
4 And all this did he take to support himself, and

24
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:47,873
 his wives and his concubines; and also his

25
00:00:47,873 --> 00:00:51,873
 priests, and their wives and their concubines; thus he

26
00:00:51,873 --> 00:00:55,873
 had changed the affairs of the kingdom

27
00:00:55,822 --> 00:01:01,822
5 For he put down all the priests that had been

28
00:01:01,822 --> 00:01:07,822
 consecrated by his father, and consecrated new ones

29
00:01:07,822 --> 00:01:13,822
 in their stead, such as were lifted up in the

30
00:01:13,822 --> 00:01:19,822
 pride of their hearts

31
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:27,746
6 Yea, and thus they were supported in their

32
00:01:27,746 --> 00:01:35,746
 laziness, and in their idolatry, and in their

33
00:01:35,746 --> 00:01:43,746
 whoredoms, by the taxes which king Noah had put upon his

34
00:01:43,746 --> 00:01:51,746
 people; thus did the people labor exceedingly to

35
00:01:51,746 --> 00:01:59,746
 support iniquity

36
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:01,62
7 Yea, and they also became idolatrous, because

37
00:02:01,62 --> 00:02:03,62
 they were deceived by the vain and flattering words

38
00:02:03,62 --> 00:02:05,62
 of the king and priests; for they did speak

39
00:02:05,62 --> 00:02:07,62
 flattering things unto them

40
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:12,394
8 And it came to pass that king Noah built many

41
00:02:12,394 --> 00:02:17,194
 elegant and spacious buildings; and he ornamented

42
00:02:17,194 --> 00:02:21,994
 them with fine work of wood, and of all manner of

43
00:02:21,994 --> 00:02:26,794
 precious things, of gold, and of silver, and of

44
00:02:26,794 --> 00:02:31,594
 iron, and of brass, and of ziff, and of copper

45
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:39,518
9 And he also built him a spacious palace, and a

46
00:02:39,518 --> 00:02:47,518
 throne in the midst thereof, all of which was of

47
00:02:47,518 --> 00:02:55,518
 fine wood and was ornamented with gold and silver

48
00:02:55,518 --> 00:03:03,518
 and with precious things

49
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:08,75
10 And he also caused that his workmen should work

50
00:03:08,75 --> 00:03:14,083
 all manner of fine work within the walls of the

51
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:19,416
 temple, of fine wood, and of copper, and of brass

52
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:23,366
11 And the seats which were set apart for the high

53
00:03:23,366 --> 00:03:27,366
 priests, which were above all the other seats, he

54
00:03:27,366 --> 00:03:31,366
 did ornament with pure gold; and he caused a

55
00:03:31,366 --> 00:03:35,366
 breastwork to be built before them, that they might

56
00:03:35,366 --> 00:03:39,366
 rest their bodies and their arms upon while they

57
00:03:39,366 --> 00:03:43,366
 should speak lying and vain words to his people

58
00:03:43,29 --> 00:03:45,957
12 And it came to pass that he built a tower near

59
00:03:45,957 --> 00:03:48,624
 the temple; yea, a very high tower, even so high

60
00:03:48,624 --> 00:03:51,291
 that he could stand upon the top thereof and

61
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,958
 overlook the land of Shilom, and also the land of

62
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:56,625
 Shemlon, which was possessed by the Lamanites; and he

63
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:59,292
 could even look over all the land round about

64
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,382
13 And it came to pass that he caused many

65
00:04:00,382 --> 00:04:01,525
 buildings to be built in the land Shilom; and he caused a

66
00:04:01,525 --> 00:04:02,668
 great tower to be built on the hill north of the

67
00:04:02,668 --> 00:04:03,811
 land Shilom, which had been a resort for the

68
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:04,954
 children of Nephi at the time they fled out of the

69
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:06,097
 land; and thus he did do with the riches which he

70
00:04:06,097 --> 00:04:07,24
 obtained by the taxation of his people

71
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:13,214
14 And it came to pass that he placed his heart

72
00:04:13,214 --> 00:04:19,214
 upon his riches, and he spent his time in riotous

73
00:04:19,214 --> 00:04:25,214
 living with his wives and his concubines; and so did

74
00:04:25,214 --> 00:04:31,214
 also his priests spend their time with harlots

75
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:33,138
15 And it came to pass that he planted vineyards

76
00:04:33,138 --> 00:04:35,138
 round about in the land; and he built wine-presses,

77
00:04:35,138 --> 00:04:37,138
 and made wine in abundance; and therefore he

78
00:04:37,138 --> 00:04:39,138
 became a wine-bibber, and also his people

79
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:45,112
16 And it came to pass that the Lamanites began to

80
00:04:45,112 --> 00:04:51,112
 come in upon his people, upon small numbers, and

81
00:04:51,112 --> 00:04:57,112
 to slay them in their fields, and while they were

82
00:04:57,112 --> 00:05:03,112
 tending their flocks

83
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,369
17 And king Noah sent guards round about the land

84
00:05:04,369 --> 00:05:05,702
 to keep them off; but he did not send a sufficient

85
00:05:05,702 --> 00:05:07,035
 number, and the Lamanites came upon them and

86
00:05:07,035 --> 00:05:08,368
 killed them, and drove many of their flocks out of the

87
00:05:08,368 --> 00:05:09,701
 land; thus the Lamanites began to destroy them,

88
00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:11,034
 and to exercise their hatred upon them

89
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:18,761
18 And it came to pass that king Noah sent his

90
00:05:18,761 --> 00:05:26,511
 armies against them, and they were driven back, or

91
00:05:26,511 --> 00:05:34,261
 they drove them back for a time; therefore, they

92
00:05:34,261 --> 00:05:42,011
 returned rejoicing in their spoil

93
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:45,909
19 And now, because of this great victory they

94
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:48,909
 were lifted up in the pride of their hearts; they did

95
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:51,909
 boast in their own strength, saying that their

96
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:54,909
 fifty could stand against thousands of the

97
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:57,909
 Lamanites; and thus they did boast, and did delight in

98
00:05:57,909 --> 00:06:00,909
 blood, and the shedding of the blood of their

99
00:06:00,909 --> 00:06:03,909
 brethren, and this because of the wickedness of their king

100
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:06,909
 and priests

101
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:07,722
20 And it came to pass that there was a man among

102
00:06:07,722 --> 00:06:08,611
 them whose name was Abinadi; and he went forth

103
00:06:08,611 --> 00:06:09,5
 among them, and began to prophesy, saying: Behold,

104
00:06:09,5 --> 00:06:10,389
 thus saith the Lord, and thus hath he commanded me,

105
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:11,278
 saying, Go forth, and say unto this people, thus

106
00:06:11,278 --> 00:06:12,167
 saith the Lord—Wo be unto this people, for I have

107
00:06:12,167 --> 00:06:13,056
 seen their abominations, and their wickedness, and

108
00:06:13,056 --> 00:06:13,945
 their whoredoms; and except they repent I will

109
00:06:13,945 --> 00:06:14,834
 visit them in mine anger

110
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:16,408
21 And except they repent and turn to the Lord

111
00:06:16,408 --> 00:06:18,008
 their God, behold, I will deliver them into the hands

112
00:06:18,008 --> 00:06:19,608
 of their enemies; yea, and they shall be brought

113
00:06:19,608 --> 00:06:21,208
 into bondage; and they shall be afflicted by the

114
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:22,808
 hand of their enemies

115
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:28,115
22 And it shall come to pass that they shall know

116
00:06:28,115 --> 00:06:33,448
 that I am the Lord their God, and am a jealous

117
00:06:33,448 --> 00:06:38,781
 God, visiting the iniquities of my people

118
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:44,732
23 And it shall come to pass that except this

119
00:06:44,732 --> 00:06:50,732
 people repent and turn unto the Lord their God, they

120
00:06:50,732 --> 00:06:56,732
 shall be brought into bondage; and none shall

121
00:06:56,732 --> 00:07:02,732
 deliver them, except it be the Lord the Almighty God

122
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:04,656
24 Yea, and it shall come to pass that when they

123
00:07:04,656 --> 00:07:06,656
 shall cry unto me I will be slow to hear their

124
00:07:06,656 --> 00:07:08,656
 cries; yea, and I will suffer them that they be

125
00:07:08,656 --> 00:07:10,656
 smitten by their enemies

126
00:07:10,63 --> 00:07:15,43
25 And except they repent in sackcloth and ashes,

127
00:07:15,43 --> 00:07:20,23
 and cry mightily to the Lord their God, I will not

128
00:07:20,23 --> 00:07:25,03
 hear their prayers, neither will I deliver them

129
00:07:25,03 --> 00:07:29,83
 out of their afflictions; and thus saith the Lord,

130
00:07:29,83 --> 00:07:34,63
 and thus hath he commanded me

131
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:36,554
26 Now it came to pass that when Abinadi had

132
00:07:36,554 --> 00:07:38,554
 spoken these words unto them they were wroth with him,

133
00:07:38,554 --> 00:07:40,554
 and sought to take away his life; but the Lord

134
00:07:40,554 --> 00:07:42,554
 delivered him out of their hands

135
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:43,862
27 Now when king Noah had heard of the words which

136
00:07:43,862 --> 00:07:45,195
 Abinadi had spoken unto the people, he was also

137
00:07:45,195 --> 00:07:46,528
 wroth; and he said: Who is Abinadi, that I and my

138
00:07:46,528 --> 00:07:47,861
 people should be judged of him, or who is the Lord,

139
00:07:47,861 --> 00:07:49,194
 that shall bring upon my people such great

140
00:07:49,194 --> 00:07:50,527
 affliction

141
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:53,703
28 I command you to bring Abinadi hither, that I

142
00:07:53,703 --> 00:07:56,903
 may slay him, for he has said these things that he

143
00:07:56,903 --> 00:08:00,103
 might stir up my people to anger one with another,

144
00:08:00,103 --> 00:08:03,303
 and to raise contentions among my people;

145
00:08:03,303 --> 00:08:06,503
 therefore I will slay him

146
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:06,953
29 Now the eyes of the people were blinded;

147
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:07,453
 therefore they hardened their hearts against the words

148
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:07,953
 of Abinadi, and they sought from that time forward

149
00:08:07,953 --> 00:08:08,453
 to take him. And king Noah hardened his heart

150
00:08:08,453 --> 00:08:08,953
 against the word of the Lord, and he did not repent of

151
00:08:08,953 --> 00:08:09,453
 his evil doings.
