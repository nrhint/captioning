00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:33,75
Chapter 29 Alma desires to cry repentance with

2
00:00:33,75 --> 00:01:07,5
 angelic zeal—The Lord grants teachers for all

3
00:01:07,5 --> 00:01:41,25
 nations—Alma glories in the Lord’s work and in the

4
00:01:41,25 --> 00:02:15,0
 success of Ammon and his brethren. About 76 B.C.

5
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:19,569
1 O that I were an angel, and could have the wish

6
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:23,569
 of mine heart, that I might go forth and speak

7
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:27,569
 with the trump of God, with a voice to shake the

8
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:31,569
 earth, and cry repentance unto every people

9
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:42,718
2 Yea, I would declare unto every soul, as with

10
00:02:42,718 --> 00:02:53,918
 the voice of thunder, repentance and the plan of

11
00:02:53,918 --> 00:03:05,118
 redemption, that they should repent and come unto our

12
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:16,318
 God, that there might not be more sorrow upon all

13
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:27,518
 the face of the earth

14
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:46,008
3 But behold, I am a man, and do sin in my wish;

15
00:03:46,008 --> 00:04:04,675
 for I ought to be content with the things which the

16
00:04:04,675 --> 00:04:23,342
 Lord hath allotted unto me

17
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:36,734
4 I ought not to harrow up in my desires the firm

18
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:50,305
 decree of a just God, for I know that he granteth

19
00:04:50,305 --> 00:05:03,876
 unto men according to their desire, whether it be

20
00:05:03,876 --> 00:05:17,447
 unto death or unto life; yea, I know that he

21
00:05:17,447 --> 00:05:31,018
 allotteth unto men, yea, decreeth unto them decrees

22
00:05:31,018 --> 00:05:44,589
 which are unalterable, according to their wills,

23
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:58,16
 whether they be unto salvation or unto destruction

24
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,192
5 Yea, and I know that good and evil have come

25
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:01,525
 before all men; he that knoweth not good from evil is

26
00:06:01,525 --> 00:06:02,858
 blameless; but he that knoweth good and evil, to

27
00:06:02,858 --> 00:06:04,191
 him it is given according to his desires, whether

28
00:06:04,191 --> 00:06:05,524
 he desireth good or evil, life or death, joy or

29
00:06:05,524 --> 00:06:06,857
 remorse of conscience

30
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:17,501
6 Now, seeing that I know these things, why should

31
00:06:17,501 --> 00:06:28,168
 I desire more than to perform the work to which I

32
00:06:28,168 --> 00:06:38,835
 have been called

33
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:42,732
7 Why should I desire that I were an angel, that I

34
00:06:42,732 --> 00:06:46,732
 could speak unto all the ends of the earth

35
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:48,04
8 For behold, the Lord doth grant unto all

36
00:06:48,04 --> 00:06:49,373
 nations, of their own nation and tongue, to teach his

37
00:06:49,373 --> 00:06:50,706
 word, yea, in wisdom, all that he seeth fit that they

38
00:06:50,706 --> 00:06:52,039
 should have; therefore we see that the Lord doth

39
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:53,372
 counsel in wisdom, according to that which is just

40
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:54,705
 and true

41
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:56,014
9 I know that which the Lord hath commanded me,

42
00:06:56,014 --> 00:06:57,347
 and I glory in it. I do not glory of myself, but I

43
00:06:57,347 --> 00:06:58,68
 glory in that which the Lord hath commanded me;

44
00:06:58,68 --> 00:07:00,013
 yea, and this is my glory, that perhaps I may be an

45
00:07:00,013 --> 00:07:01,346
 instrument in the hands of God to bring some soul

46
00:07:01,346 --> 00:07:02,679
 to repentance; and this is my joy

47
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:07,989
10 And behold, when I see many of my brethren

48
00:07:07,989 --> 00:07:13,322
 truly penitent, and coming to the Lord their God, then

49
00:07:13,322 --> 00:07:18,655
 is my soul filled with joy; then do I remember

50
00:07:18,655 --> 00:07:23,988
 what the Lord has done for me, yea, even that he

51
00:07:23,988 --> 00:07:29,321
 hath heard my prayer; yea, then do I remember his

52
00:07:29,321 --> 00:07:34,654
 merciful arm which he extended towards me

53
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:41,222
11 Yea, and I also remember the captivity of my

54
00:07:41,222 --> 00:07:47,889
 fathers; for I surely do know that the Lord did

55
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:54,556
 deliver them out of bondage, and by this did establish

56
00:07:54,556 --> 00:08:01,223
 his church; yea, the Lord God, the God of

57
00:08:01,223 --> 00:08:07,89
 Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, did

58
00:08:07,89 --> 00:08:14,557
 deliver them out of bondage

59
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:22,428
12 Yea, I have always remembered the captivity of

60
00:08:22,428 --> 00:08:30,428
 my fathers; and that same God who delivered them

61
00:08:30,428 --> 00:08:38,428
 out of the hands of the Egyptians did deliver them

62
00:08:38,428 --> 00:08:46,428
 out of bondage

63
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:54,326
13 Yea, and that same God did establish his church

64
00:08:54,326 --> 00:09:02,326
 among them; yea, and that same God hath called me

65
00:09:02,326 --> 00:09:10,326
 by a holy calling, to preach the word unto this

66
00:09:10,326 --> 00:09:18,326
 people, and hath given me much success, in the

67
00:09:18,326 --> 00:09:26,326
 which my joy is full

68
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:19,569
16 Now, when I think of the success of these my

69
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:23,569
 brethren my soul is carried away, even to the

70
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:27,569
 separation of it from the body, as it were, so great is

71
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:31,569
 my joy

72
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:31,518
17 And now may God grant unto these, my brethren,

73
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:31,518
 that they may sit down in the kingdom of God; yea,

74
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:31,518
 and also all those who are the fruit of their

75
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:31,518
 labors that they may go no more out, but that they

76
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:31,518
 may praise him forever. And may God grant that it

77
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:31,518
 may be done according to my words, even as I have

78
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:31,518
 spoken. Amen.
