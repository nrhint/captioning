1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:10,167
Chapter 14 Alma and Amulek are imprisoned and

2
00:00:10,167 --> 00:00:20,334
 smitten—The believers and their holy scriptures are

3
00:00:20,334 --> 00:00:30,501
 burned by fire—These martyrs are received by the

4
00:00:30,501 --> 00:00:40,668
 Lord in glory—The prison walls are rent and fall—Alma

5
00:00:40,668 --> 00:00:50,835
 and Amulek are delivered, and their persecutors

6
00:00:50,835 --> 00:01:01,002
 are slain. About 82–81 B.C.

7
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:05,594
1 And it came to pass after he had made an end of

8
00:01:05,594 --> 00:01:10,094
 speaking unto the people many of them did believe

9
00:01:10,094 --> 00:01:14,594
 on his words, and began to repent, and to search

10
00:01:14,594 --> 00:01:19,094
 the scriptures

11
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:25,513
2 But the more part of them were desirous that

12
00:01:25,513 --> 00:01:31,513
 they might destroy Alma and Amulek; for they were

13
00:01:31,513 --> 00:01:37,513
 angry with Alma, because of the plainness of his

14
00:01:37,513 --> 00:01:43,513
 words unto Zeezrom; and they also said that Amulek had

15
00:01:43,513 --> 00:01:49,513
 lied unto them, and had reviled against their law

16
00:01:49,513 --> 00:01:55,513
 and also against their lawyers and judges

17
00:01:55,215 --> 00:02:00,215
3 And they were also angry with Alma and Amulek;

18
00:02:00,215 --> 00:02:05,215
 and because they had testified so plainly against

19
00:02:05,215 --> 00:02:10,215
 their wickedness, they sought to put them away

20
00:02:10,215 --> 00:02:15,215
 privily

21
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:22,636
4 But it came to pass that they did not; but they

22
00:02:22,636 --> 00:02:29,303
 took them and bound them with strong cords, and

23
00:02:29,303 --> 00:02:35,97
 took them before the chief judge of the land

24
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:41,677
5 And the people went forth and witnessed against

25
00:02:41,677 --> 00:02:47,899
 them—testifying that they had reviled against the

26
00:02:47,899 --> 00:02:54,121
 law, and their lawyers and judges of the land, and

27
00:02:54,121 --> 00:03:00,343
 also of all the people that were in the land; and

28
00:03:00,343 --> 00:03:06,565
 also testified that there was but one God, and

29
00:03:06,565 --> 00:03:12,787
 that he should send his Son among the people, but he

30
00:03:12,787 --> 00:03:19,009
 should not save them; and many such things did

31
00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:25,231
 the people testify against Alma and Amulek. Now this

32
00:03:25,231 --> 00:03:31,453
 was done before the chief judge of the land

33
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:36,707
6 And it came to pass that Zeezrom was astonished

34
00:03:36,707 --> 00:03:42,136
 at the words which had been spoken; and he also

35
00:03:42,136 --> 00:03:47,565
 knew concerning the blindness of the minds, which he

36
00:03:47,565 --> 00:03:52,994
 had caused among the people by his lying words;

37
00:03:52,994 --> 00:03:58,423
 and his soul began to be harrowed up under a

38
00:03:58,423 --> 00:04:03,852
 consciousness of his own guilt; yea, he began to be

39
00:04:03,852 --> 00:04:09,281
 encircled about by the pains of hell

40
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:15,916
7 And it came to pass that he began to cry unto

41
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:22,116
 the people, saying: Behold, I am guilty, and these

42
00:04:22,116 --> 00:04:28,316
 men are spotless before God. And he began to plead

43
00:04:28,316 --> 00:04:34,516
 for them from that time forth; but they reviled

44
00:04:34,516 --> 00:04:40,716
 him, saying: Art thou also possessed with the devil?

45
00:04:40,716 --> 00:04:46,916
 And they spit upon him, and cast him out from

46
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:53,116
 among them, and also all those who believed in the

47
00:04:53,116 --> 00:04:59,316
 words which had been spoken by Alma and Amulek; and

48
00:04:59,316 --> 00:05:05,516
 they cast them out, and sent men to cast stones at

49
00:05:05,516 --> 00:05:11,716
 them

50
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:17,168
8 And they brought their wives and children

51
00:05:17,168 --> 00:05:23,025
 together, and whosoever believed or had been taught to

52
00:05:23,025 --> 00:05:28,882
 believe in the word of God they caused that they

53
00:05:28,882 --> 00:05:34,739
 should be cast into the fire; and they also brought

54
00:05:34,739 --> 00:05:40,596
 forth their records which contained the holy

55
00:05:40,596 --> 00:05:46,453
 scriptures, and cast them into the fire also, that they

56
00:05:46,453 --> 00:05:52,31
 might be burned and destroyed by fire

57
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:58,269
9 And it came to pass that they took Alma and

58
00:05:58,269 --> 00:06:04,019
 Amulek, and carried them forth to the place of

59
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:09,769
 martyrdom, that they might witness the destruction of

60
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:15,519
 those who were consumed by fire

61
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:21,808
10 And when Amulek saw the pains of the women and

62
00:06:21,808 --> 00:06:28,141
 children who were consuming in the fire, he also

63
00:06:28,141 --> 00:06:34,474
 was pained; and he said unto Alma: How can we

64
00:06:34,474 --> 00:06:40,807
 witness this awful scene? Therefore let us stretch

65
00:06:40,807 --> 00:06:47,14
 forth our hands, and exercise the power of God which

66
00:06:47,14 --> 00:06:53,473
 is in us, and save them from the flames

67
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:57,213
11 But Alma said unto him: The Spirit constraineth

68
00:06:57,213 --> 00:07:01,213
 me that I must not stretch forth mine hand; for

69
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:05,213
 behold the Lord receiveth them up unto himself, in

70
00:07:05,213 --> 00:07:09,213
 glory; and he doth suffer that they may do this

71
00:07:09,213 --> 00:07:13,213
 thing, or that the people may do this thing unto

72
00:07:13,213 --> 00:07:17,213
 them, according to the hardness of their hearts, that

73
00:07:17,213 --> 00:07:21,213
 the judgments which he shall exercise upon them

74
00:07:21,213 --> 00:07:25,213
 in his wrath may be just; and the blood of the

75
00:07:25,213 --> 00:07:29,213
 innocent shall stand as a witness against them, yea,

76
00:07:29,213 --> 00:07:33,213
 and cry mightily against them at the last day

77
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:48,086
12 Now Amulek said unto Alma: Behold, perhaps they

78
00:07:48,086 --> 00:08:03,086
 will burn us also

79
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:09,649
13 And Alma said: Be it according to the will of

80
00:08:09,649 --> 00:08:15,982
 the Lord. But, behold, our work is not finished;

81
00:08:15,982 --> 00:08:22,315
 therefore they burn us not

82
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,002
14 Now it came to pass that when the bodies of

83
00:08:25,002 --> 00:08:27,669
 those who had been cast into the fire were consumed,

84
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:30,336
 and also the records which were cast in with them,

85
00:08:30,336 --> 00:08:33,003
 the chief judge of the land came and stood before

86
00:08:33,003 --> 00:08:35,67
 Alma and Amulek, as they were bound; and he smote

87
00:08:35,67 --> 00:08:38,337
 them with his hand upon their cheeks, and said

88
00:08:38,337 --> 00:08:41,004
 unto them: After what ye have seen, will ye preach

89
00:08:41,004 --> 00:08:43,671
 again unto this people, that they shall be cast

90
00:08:43,671 --> 00:08:46,338
 into a lake of fire and brimstone

91
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:49,459
15 Behold, ye see that ye had not power to save

92
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:52,659
 those who had been cast into the fire; neither has

93
00:08:52,659 --> 00:08:55,859
 God saved them because they were of thy faith. And

94
00:08:55,859 --> 00:08:59,059
 the judge smote them again upon their cheeks, and

95
00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:02,259
 asked: What say ye for yourselves

96
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:06,208
16 Now this judge was after the order and faith of

97
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:10,208
 Nehor, who slew Gideon

98
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:12,85
17 And it came to pass that Alma and Amulek

99
00:09:12,85 --> 00:09:15,517
 answered him nothing; and he smote them again, and

100
00:09:15,517 --> 00:09:18,184
 delivered them to the officers to be cast into prison

101
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:19,491
18 And when they had been cast into prison three

102
00:09:19,491 --> 00:09:20,824
 days, there came many lawyers, and judges, and

103
00:09:20,824 --> 00:09:22,157
 priests, and teachers, who were of the profession of

104
00:09:22,157 --> 00:09:23,49
 Nehor; and they came in unto the prison to see

105
00:09:23,49 --> 00:09:24,823
 them, and they questioned them about many words; but

106
00:09:24,823 --> 00:09:26,156
 they answered them nothing

107
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,732
19 And it came to pass that the judge stood before

108
00:09:27,732 --> 00:09:29,332
 them, and said: Why do ye not answer the words of

109
00:09:29,332 --> 00:09:30,932
 this people? Know ye not that I have power to

110
00:09:30,932 --> 00:09:32,532
 deliver you up unto the flames? And he commanded them

111
00:09:32,532 --> 00:09:34,132
 to speak; but they answered nothing

112
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:35,25
20 And it came to pass that they departed and went

113
00:09:35,25 --> 00:09:36,393
 their ways, but came again on the morrow; and the

114
00:09:36,393 --> 00:09:37,536
 judge also smote them again on their cheeks. And

115
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:38,679
 many came forth also, and smote them, saying: Will

116
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,822
 ye stand again and judge this people, and condemn

117
00:09:39,822 --> 00:09:40,965
 our law? If ye have such great power why do ye

118
00:09:40,965 --> 00:09:42,108
 not deliver yourselves

119
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,082
21 And many such things did they say unto them,

120
00:09:44,082 --> 00:09:46,082
 gnashing their teeth upon them, and spitting upon

121
00:09:46,082 --> 00:09:48,082
 them, and saying: How shall we look when we are

122
00:09:48,082 --> 00:09:50,082
 damned

123
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:51,056
22 And many such things, yea, all manner of such

124
00:09:51,056 --> 00:09:52,056
 things did they say unto them; and thus they did

125
00:09:52,056 --> 00:09:53,056
 mock them for many days. And they did withhold food

126
00:09:53,056 --> 00:09:54,056
 from them that they might hunger, and water that

127
00:09:54,056 --> 00:09:55,056
 they might thirst; and they also did take from them

128
00:09:55,056 --> 00:09:56,056
 their clothes that they were naked; and thus they

129
00:09:56,056 --> 00:09:57,056
 were bound with strong cords, and confined in

130
00:09:57,056 --> 00:09:58,056
 prison

131
00:09:58,031 --> 00:09:59,031
23 And it came to pass after they had thus

132
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:00,031
 suffered for many days, (and it was on the twelfth day,

133
00:10:00,031 --> 00:10:01,031
 in the tenth month, in the tenth year of the reign

134
00:10:01,031 --> 00:10:02,031
 of the judges over the people of Nephi) that the

135
00:10:02,031 --> 00:10:03,031
 chief judge over the land of Ammonihah and many of

136
00:10:03,031 --> 00:10:04,031
 their teachers and their lawyers went in unto the

137
00:10:04,031 --> 00:10:05,031
 prison where Alma and Amulek were bound with

138
00:10:05,031 --> 00:10:06,031
 cords

139
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:07,405
24 And the chief judge stood before them, and

140
00:10:07,405 --> 00:10:08,805
 smote them again, and said unto them: If ye have the

141
00:10:08,805 --> 00:10:10,205
 power of God deliver yourselves from these bands,

142
00:10:10,205 --> 00:10:11,605
 and then we will believe that the Lord will destroy

143
00:10:11,605 --> 00:10:13,005
 this people according to your words

144
00:10:13,98 --> 00:10:17,18
25 And it came to pass that they all went forth

145
00:10:17,18 --> 00:10:20,38
 and smote them, saying the same words, even until

146
00:10:20,38 --> 00:10:23,58
 the last; and when the last had spoken unto them the

147
00:10:23,58 --> 00:10:26,78
 power of God was upon Alma and Amulek, and they

148
00:10:26,78 --> 00:10:29,98
 rose and stood upon their feet

149
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,072
26 And Alma cried, saying: How long shall we

150
00:10:31,072 --> 00:10:32,215
 suffer these great afflictions, O Lord? O Lord, give us

151
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:33,358
 strength according to our faith which is in

152
00:10:33,358 --> 00:10:34,501
 Christ, even unto deliverance. And they broke the cords

153
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:35,644
 with which they were bound; and when the people

154
00:10:35,644 --> 00:10:36,787
 saw this, they began to flee, for the fear of

155
00:10:36,787 --> 00:10:37,93
 destruction had come upon them

156
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:38,904
27 And it came to pass that so great was their

157
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:39,904
 fear that they fell to the earth, and did not obtain

158
00:10:39,904 --> 00:10:40,904
 the outer door of the prison; and the earth shook

159
00:10:40,904 --> 00:10:41,904
 mightily, and the walls of the prison were rent in

160
00:10:41,904 --> 00:10:42,904
 twain, so that they fell to the earth; and the

161
00:10:42,904 --> 00:10:43,904
 chief judge, and the lawyers, and priests, and

162
00:10:43,904 --> 00:10:44,904
 teachers, who smote upon Alma and Amulek, were slain by

163
00:10:44,904 --> 00:10:45,904
 the fall thereof

164
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:46,768
28 And Alma and Amulek came forth out of the

165
00:10:46,768 --> 00:10:47,657
 prison, and they were not hurt; for the Lord had

166
00:10:47,657 --> 00:10:48,546
 granted unto them power, according to their faith which

167
00:10:48,546 --> 00:10:49,435
 was in Christ. And they straightway came forth out

168
00:10:49,435 --> 00:10:50,324
 of the prison; and they were loosed from their

169
00:10:50,324 --> 00:10:51,213
 bands; and the prison had fallen to the earth, and

170
00:10:51,213 --> 00:10:52,102
 every soul within the walls thereof, save it were

171
00:10:52,102 --> 00:10:52,991
 Alma and Amulek, was slain; and they straightway

172
00:10:52,991 --> 00:10:53,88
 came forth into the city

173
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:54,409
29 Now the people having heard a great noise came

174
00:10:54,409 --> 00:10:54,965
 running together by multitudes to know the cause

175
00:10:54,965 --> 00:10:55,521
 of it; and when they saw Alma and Amulek coming

176
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:56,077
 forth out of the prison, and the walls thereof had

177
00:10:56,077 --> 00:10:56,633
 fallen to the earth, they were struck with great

178
00:10:56,633 --> 00:10:57,189
 fear, and fled from the presence of Alma and Amulek

179
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:57,745
 even as a goat fleeth with her young from two

180
00:10:57,745 --> 00:10:58,301
 lions; and thus they did flee from the presence of Alma

181
00:10:58,301 --> 00:10:58,857
 and Amulek.
