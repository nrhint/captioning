00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:34,5
The commandments of Alma to his son Corianton.

2
00:00:34,5 --> 00:01:09,0
 Comprising chapters 39 through 42.Chapter 39 Sexual

3
00:01:09,0 --> 00:01:43,5
 sin is an abomination—Corianton’s sins kept the

4
00:01:43,5 --> 00:02:18,0
 Zoramites from receiving the word—Christ’s redemption

5
00:02:18,0 --> 00:02:52,5
 is retroactive in saving the faithful who

6
00:02:52,5 --> 00:03:27,0
 preceded it. About 74 B.C.

7
00:03:27,34 --> 00:03:35,34
1 And now, my son, I have somewhat more to say

8
00:03:35,34 --> 00:03:43,34
 unto thee than what I said unto thy brother; for

9
00:03:43,34 --> 00:03:51,34
 behold, have ye not observed the steadiness of thy

10
00:03:51,34 --> 00:03:59,34
 brother, his faithfulness, and his diligence in

11
00:03:59,34 --> 00:04:07,34
 keeping the commandments of God? Behold, has he not set

12
00:04:07,34 --> 00:04:15,34
 a good example for thee

13
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:24,788
2 For thou didst not give so much heed unto my

14
00:04:24,788 --> 00:04:34,388
 words as did thy brother, among the people of the

15
00:04:34,388 --> 00:04:43,988
 Zoramites. Now this is what I have against thee; thou

16
00:04:43,988 --> 00:04:53,588
 didst go on unto boasting in thy strength and thy

17
00:04:53,588 --> 00:05:03,188
 wisdom

18
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:06,036
3 And this is not all, my son. Thou didst do that

19
00:05:06,036 --> 00:05:09,036
 which was grievous unto me; for thou didst forsake

20
00:05:09,036 --> 00:05:12,036
 the ministry, and did go over into the land of

21
00:05:12,036 --> 00:05:15,036
 Siron among the borders of the Lamanites, after the

22
00:05:15,036 --> 00:05:18,036
 harlot Isabel

23
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:24,985
4 Yea, she did steal away the hearts of many; but

24
00:05:24,985 --> 00:05:30,985
 this was no excuse for thee, my son. Thou shouldst

25
00:05:30,985 --> 00:05:36,985
 have tended to the ministry wherewith thou wast

26
00:05:36,985 --> 00:05:42,985
 entrusted

27
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:52,909
5 Know ye not, my son, that these things are an

28
00:05:52,909 --> 00:06:02,909
 abomination in the sight of the Lord; yea, most

29
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:12,909
 abominable above all sins save it be the shedding of

30
00:06:12,909 --> 00:06:22,909
 innocent blood or denying the Holy Ghost

31
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:27,353
6 For behold, if ye deny the Holy Ghost when it

32
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:31,924
 once has had place in you, and ye know that ye deny

33
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:36,495
 it, behold, this is a sin which is unpardonable;

34
00:06:36,495 --> 00:06:41,066
 yea, and whosoever murdereth against the light and

35
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:45,637
 knowledge of God, it is not easy for him to obtain

36
00:06:45,637 --> 00:06:50,208
 forgiveness; yea, I say unto you, my son, that it

37
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:54,779
 is not easy for him to obtain a forgiveness

38
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:58,681
7 And now, my son, I would to God that ye had not

39
00:06:58,681 --> 00:07:02,681
 been guilty of so great a crime. I would not dwell

40
00:07:02,681 --> 00:07:06,681
 upon your crimes, to harrow up your soul, if it

41
00:07:06,681 --> 00:07:10,681
 were not for your good

42
00:07:10,63 --> 00:08:03,963
8 But behold, ye cannot hide your crimes from God;

43
00:08:03,963 --> 00:08:57,296
 and except ye repent they will stand as a

44
00:08:57,296 --> 00:09:50,629
 testimony against you at the last day

45
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:52,79
9 Now my son, I would that ye should repent and

46
00:09:52,79 --> 00:09:55,457
 forsake your sins, and go no more after the lusts of

47
00:09:55,457 --> 00:09:58,124
 your eyes, but cross yourself in all these

48
00:09:58,124 --> 00:10:00,791
 things; for except ye do this ye can in nowise inherit

49
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:03,458
 the kingdom of God. Oh, remember, and take it upon

50
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:06,125
 you, and cross yourself in these things

51
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:13,872
10 And I command you to take it upon you to

52
00:10:13,872 --> 00:10:21,672
 counsel with your elder brothers in your undertakings;

53
00:10:21,672 --> 00:10:29,472
 for behold, thou art in thy youth, and ye stand in

54
00:10:29,472 --> 00:10:37,272
 need to be nourished by your brothers. And give

55
00:10:37,272 --> 00:10:45,072
 heed to their counsel

56
00:03:27,34 --> 00:03:36,94
13 That ye turn to the Lord with all your mind,

57
00:03:36,94 --> 00:03:46,54
 might, and strength; that ye lead away the hearts of

58
00:03:46,54 --> 00:03:56,14
 no more to do wickedly; but rather return unto

59
00:03:56,14 --> 00:04:05,74
 them, and acknowledge your faults and that wrong

60
00:04:05,74 --> 00:04:15,34
 which ye have done

61
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:31,188
14 Seek not after riches nor the vain things of

62
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:47,188
 this world; for behold, you cannot carry them with

63
00:04:47,188 --> 00:05:03,188
 you

64
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:06,036
15 And now, my son, I would say somewhat unto you

65
00:05:06,036 --> 00:05:09,036
 concerning the coming of Christ. Behold, I say

66
00:05:09,036 --> 00:05:12,036
 unto you, that it is he that surely shall come to

67
00:05:12,036 --> 00:05:15,036
 take away the sins of the world; yea, he cometh to

68
00:05:15,036 --> 00:05:18,036
 declare glad tidings of salvation unto his people

69
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,985
16 And now, my son, this was the ministry unto

70
00:05:22,985 --> 00:05:26,985
 which ye were called, to declare these glad tidings

71
00:05:26,985 --> 00:05:30,985
 unto this people, to prepare their minds; or rather

72
00:05:30,985 --> 00:05:34,985
 that salvation might come unto them, that they

73
00:05:34,985 --> 00:05:38,985
 may prepare the minds of their children to hear the

74
00:05:38,985 --> 00:05:42,985
 word at the time of his coming

75
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:50,909
17 And now I will ease your mind somewhat on this

76
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:58,909
 subject. Behold, you marvel why these things

77
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:06,909
 should be known so long beforehand. Behold, I say unto

78
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:14,909
 you, is not a soul at this time as precious unto

79
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:22,909
 God as a soul will be at the time of his coming

80
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:33,449
18 Is it not as necessary that the plan of

81
00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:44,116
 redemption should be made known unto this people as well

82
00:06:44,116 --> 00:06:54,783
 as unto their children

83
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:54,931
19 Is it not as easy at this time for the Lord to

84
00:06:54,931 --> 00:06:55,181
 send his angel to declare these glad tidings unto

85
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:55,431
 us as unto our children, or as after the time of

86
00:06:55,431 --> 00:06:55,681
 his coming?
