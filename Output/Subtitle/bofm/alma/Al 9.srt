1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:09,333
The words of Alma, and also the words of Amulek,

2
00:00:09,333 --> 00:00:18,666
 which were declared unto the people who were in the

3
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:27,999
 land of Ammonihah. And also they are cast into

4
00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:37,332
 prison, and delivered by the miraculous power of God

5
00:00:37,332 --> 00:00:46,665
 which was in them, according to the record of

6
00:00:46,665 --> 00:00:55,998
 Alma. Comprising chapters 9 through 14.Chapter 9 Alma

7
00:00:55,998 --> 00:01:05,331
 commands the people of Ammonihah to repent—The

8
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:14,664
 Lord will be merciful to the Lamanites in the last

9
00:01:14,664 --> 00:01:23,997
 days—If the Nephites forsake the light, they will

10
00:01:23,997 --> 00:01:33,33
 be destroyed by the Lamanites—The Son of God will

11
00:01:33,33 --> 00:01:42,663
 come soon—He will redeem those who repent, are

12
00:01:42,663 --> 00:01:51,996
 baptized, and have faith in His name. About 82 B.C.

13
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:57,679
1 And again, I, Alma, having been commanded of God

14
00:01:57,679 --> 00:02:02,846
 that I should take Amulek and go forth and preach

15
00:02:02,846 --> 00:02:08,013
 again unto this people, or the people who were in

16
00:02:08,013 --> 00:02:13,18
 the city of Ammonihah, it came to pass as I began

17
00:02:13,18 --> 00:02:18,347
 to preach unto them, they began to contend with

18
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:23,514
 me, saying

19
00:02:23,01 --> 00:02:29,01
2 Who art thou? Suppose ye that we shall believe

20
00:02:29,01 --> 00:02:35,01
 the testimony of one man, although he should preach

21
00:02:35,01 --> 00:02:41,01
 unto us that the earth should pass away

22
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:46,828
3 Now they understood not the words which they

23
00:02:46,828 --> 00:02:51,828
 spake; for they knew not that the earth should pass

24
00:02:51,828 --> 00:02:56,828
 away

25
00:02:56,376 --> 00:03:03,376
4 And they said also: We will not believe thy

26
00:03:03,376 --> 00:03:10,376
 words if thou shouldst prophesy that this great city

27
00:03:10,376 --> 00:03:17,376
 should be destroyed in one day

28
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:23,53
5 Now they knew not that God could do such

29
00:03:23,53 --> 00:03:29,863
 marvelous works, for they were a hard-hearted and a

30
00:03:29,863 --> 00:03:36,196
 stiffnecked people

31
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:41,466
6 And they said: Who is God, that sendeth no more

32
00:03:41,466 --> 00:03:46,716
 authority than one man among this people, to

33
00:03:46,716 --> 00:03:51,966
 declare unto them the truth of such great and marvelous

34
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:57,216
 things

35
00:03:57,938 --> 00:04:03,188
7 And they stood forth to lay their hands on me;

36
00:04:03,188 --> 00:04:08,438
 but behold, they did not. And I stood with boldness

37
00:04:08,438 --> 00:04:13,688
 to declare unto them, yea, I did boldly testify

38
00:04:13,688 --> 00:04:18,938
 unto them, saying

39
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:24,108
8 Behold, O ye wicked and perverse generation, how

40
00:04:24,108 --> 00:04:29,858
 have ye forgotten the tradition of your fathers;

41
00:04:29,858 --> 00:04:35,608
 yea, how soon ye have forgotten the commandments

42
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:41,358
 of God

43
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:48,064
9 Do ye not remember that our father, Lehi, was

44
00:04:48,064 --> 00:04:54,814
 brought out of Jerusalem by the hand of God? Do ye

45
00:04:54,814 --> 00:05:01,564
 not remember that they were all led by him through

46
00:05:01,564 --> 00:05:08,314
 the wilderness

47
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:15,542
10 And have ye forgotten so soon how many times he

48
00:05:15,542 --> 00:05:22,542
 delivered our fathers out of the hands of their

49
00:05:22,542 --> 00:05:29,542
 enemies, and preserved them from being destroyed,

50
00:05:29,542 --> 00:05:36,542
 even by the hands of their own brethren

51
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:42,903
11 Yea, and if it had not been for his matchless

52
00:05:42,903 --> 00:05:49,57
 power, and his mercy, and his long-suffering

53
00:05:49,57 --> 00:05:56,237
 towards us, we should unavoidably have been cut off from

54
00:05:56,237 --> 00:06:02,904
 the face of the earth long before this period of

55
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:09,571
 time, and perhaps been consigned to a state of

56
00:06:09,571 --> 00:06:16,238
 endless misery and woe

57
00:06:16,71 --> 00:06:23,853
12 Behold, now I say unto you that he commandeth

58
00:06:23,853 --> 00:06:30,996
 you to repent; and except ye repent, ye can in

59
00:06:30,996 --> 00:06:38,139
 nowise inherit the kingdom of God. But behold, this is

60
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:45,282
 not all—he has commanded you to repent, or he

61
00:06:45,282 --> 00:06:52,425
 will utterly destroy you from off the face of the

62
00:06:52,425 --> 00:06:59,568
 earth; yea, he will visit you in his anger, and in

63
00:06:59,568 --> 00:07:06,711
 his fierce anger he will not turn away

64
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:12,526
13 Behold, do ye not remember the words which he

65
00:07:12,526 --> 00:07:18,693
 spake unto Lehi, saying that: Inasmuch as ye shall

66
00:07:18,693 --> 00:07:24,86
 keep my commandments, ye shall prosper in the

67
00:07:24,86 --> 00:07:31,027
 land? And again it is said that: Inasmuch as ye will

68
00:07:31,027 --> 00:07:37,194
 not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from

69
00:07:37,194 --> 00:07:43,361
 the presence of the Lord

70
00:07:43,83 --> 00:07:49,83
14 Now I would that ye should remember, that

71
00:07:49,83 --> 00:07:55,83
 inasmuch as the Lamanites have not kept the

72
00:07:55,83 --> 00:08:01,83
 commandments of God, they have been cut off from the presence

73
00:08:01,83 --> 00:08:07,83
 of the Lord. Now we see that the word of the Lord

74
00:08:07,83 --> 00:08:13,83
 has been verified in this thing, and the

75
00:08:13,83 --> 00:08:19,83
 Lamanites have been cut off from his presence, from the

76
00:08:19,83 --> 00:08:25,83
 beginning of their transgressions in the land

77
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:32,539
15 Nevertheless I say unto you, that it shall be

78
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:39,339
 more tolerable for them in the day of judgment than

79
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:46,139
 for you, if ye remain in your sins, yea, and even

80
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:52,939
 more tolerable for them in this life than for

81
00:08:52,939 --> 00:08:59,739
 you, except ye repent

82
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:05,339
16 For there are many promises which are extended

83
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:11,006
 to the Lamanites; for it is because of the

84
00:09:11,006 --> 00:09:16,673
 traditions of their fathers that caused them to remain in

85
00:09:16,673 --> 00:09:22,34
 their state of ignorance; therefore the Lord will

86
00:09:22,34 --> 00:09:28,007
 be merciful unto them and prolong their existence

87
00:09:28,007 --> 00:09:33,674
 in the land

88
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:39,773
17 And at some period of time they will be brought

89
00:09:39,773 --> 00:09:46,173
 to believe in his word, and to know of the

90
00:09:46,173 --> 00:09:52,573
 incorrectness of the traditions of their fathers; and

91
00:09:52,573 --> 00:09:58,973
 many of them will be saved, for the Lord will be

92
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:05,373
 merciful unto all who call on his name

93
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:11,557
18 But behold, I say unto you that if ye persist

94
00:10:11,557 --> 00:10:17,843
 in your wickedness that your days shall not be

95
00:10:17,843 --> 00:10:24,129
 prolonged in the land, for the Lamanites shall be sent

96
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:30,415
 upon you; and if ye repent not they shall come in

97
00:10:30,415 --> 00:10:36,701
 a time when you know not, and ye shall be visited

98
00:10:36,701 --> 00:10:42,987
 with utter destruction; and it shall be according

99
00:10:42,987 --> 00:10:49,273
 to the fierce anger of the Lord

100
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:56,074
19 For he will not suffer you that ye shall live

101
00:10:56,074 --> 00:11:02,199
 in your iniquities, to destroy his people. I say

102
00:11:02,199 --> 00:11:08,324
 unto you, Nay; he would rather suffer that the

103
00:11:08,324 --> 00:11:14,449
 Lamanites might destroy all his people who are called

104
00:11:14,449 --> 00:11:20,574
 the people of Nephi, if it were possible that they

105
00:11:20,574 --> 00:11:26,699
 could fall into sins and transgressions, after

106
00:11:26,699 --> 00:11:32,824
 having had so much light and so much knowledge given

107
00:11:32,824 --> 00:11:38,949
 unto them of the Lord their God

108
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:44,593
20 Yea, after having been such a highly favored

109
00:11:44,593 --> 00:11:51,022
 people of the Lord; yea, after having been favored

110
00:11:51,022 --> 00:11:57,451
 above every other nation, kindred, tongue, or

111
00:11:57,451 --> 00:12:03,88
 people; after having had all things made known unto

112
00:12:03,88 --> 00:12:10,309
 them, according to their desires, and their faith,

113
00:12:10,309 --> 00:12:16,738
 and prayers, of that which has been, and which is,

114
00:12:16,738 --> 00:12:23,167
 and which is to come

115
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:30,719
21 Having been visited by the Spirit of God;

116
00:12:30,719 --> 00:12:37,862
 having conversed with angels, and having been spoken

117
00:12:37,862 --> 00:12:45,005
 unto by the voice of the Lord; and having the spirit

118
00:12:45,005 --> 00:12:52,148
 of prophecy, and the spirit of revelation, and

119
00:12:52,148 --> 00:12:59,291
 also many gifts, the gift of speaking with tongues,

120
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:06,434
 and the gift of preaching, and the gift of the

121
00:13:06,434 --> 00:13:13,577
 Holy Ghost, and the gift of translation

122
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:20,326
22 Yea, and after having been delivered of God out

123
00:13:20,326 --> 00:13:26,659
 of the land of Jerusalem, by the hand of the

124
00:13:26,659 --> 00:13:32,992
 Lord; having been saved from famine, and from

125
00:13:32,992 --> 00:13:39,325
 sickness, and all manner of diseases of every kind; and

126
00:13:39,325 --> 00:13:45,658
 they having waxed strong in battle, that they might

127
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:51,991
 not be destroyed; having been brought out of

128
00:13:51,991 --> 00:13:58,324
 bondage time after time, and having been kept and

129
00:13:58,324 --> 00:14:04,657
 preserved until now; and they have been prospered until

130
00:14:04,657 --> 00:14:10,99
 they are rich in all manner of things

131
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:17,454
23 And now behold I say unto you, that if this

132
00:14:17,454 --> 00:14:24,025
 people, who have received so many blessings from the

133
00:14:24,025 --> 00:14:30,596
 hand of the Lord, should transgress contrary to

134
00:14:30,596 --> 00:14:37,167
 the light and knowledge which they do have, I say

135
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:43,738
 unto you that if this be the case, that if they

136
00:14:43,738 --> 00:14:50,309
 should fall into transgression, it would be far more

137
00:14:50,309 --> 00:14:56,88
 tolerable for the Lamanites than for them

138
00:14:56,062 --> 00:15:01,895
24 For behold, the promises of the Lord are

139
00:15:01,895 --> 00:15:07,728
 extended to the Lamanites, but they are not unto you if

140
00:15:07,728 --> 00:15:13,561
 ye transgress; for has not the Lord expressly

141
00:15:13,561 --> 00:15:19,394
 promised and firmly decreed, that if ye will rebel

142
00:15:19,394 --> 00:15:25,227
 against him that ye shall utterly be destroyed from

143
00:15:25,227 --> 00:15:31,06
 off the face of the earth

144
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:37,964
25 And now for this cause, that ye may not be

145
00:15:37,964 --> 00:15:43,964
 destroyed, the Lord has sent his angel to visit many

146
00:15:43,964 --> 00:15:49,964
 of his people, declaring unto them that they must

147
00:15:49,964 --> 00:15:55,964
 go forth and cry mightily unto this people, saying:

148
00:15:55,964 --> 00:16:01,964
 Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is nigh at

149
00:16:01,964 --> 00:16:07,964
 hand

150
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:14,3
26 And not many days hence the Son of God shall

151
00:16:14,3 --> 00:16:20,967
 come in his glory; and his glory shall be the glory

152
00:16:20,967 --> 00:16:27,634
 of the Only Begotten of the Father, full of grace,

153
00:16:27,634 --> 00:16:34,301
 equity, and truth, full of patience, mercy, and

154
00:16:34,301 --> 00:16:40,968
 long-suffering, quick to hear the cries of his

155
00:16:40,968 --> 00:16:47,635
 people and to answer their prayers

156
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:52,039
27 And behold, he cometh to redeem those who will

157
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:57,039
 be baptized unto repentance, through faith on his

158
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:02,039
 name

159
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:08,755
28 Therefore, prepare ye the way of the Lord, for

160
00:17:08,755 --> 00:17:14,755
 the time is at hand that all men shall reap a

161
00:17:14,755 --> 00:17:20,755
 reward of their works, according to that which they

162
00:17:20,755 --> 00:17:26,755
 have been—if they have been righteous they shall

163
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:32,755
 reap the salvation of their souls, according to the

164
00:17:32,755 --> 00:17:38,755
 power and deliverance of Jesus Christ; and if they

165
00:17:38,755 --> 00:17:44,755
 have been evil they shall reap the damnation of

166
00:17:44,755 --> 00:17:50,755
 their souls, according to the power and captivation

167
00:17:50,755 --> 00:17:56,755
 of the devil

168
00:17:56,742 --> 00:18:01,742
29 Now behold, this is the voice of the angel,

169
00:18:01,742 --> 00:18:06,742
 crying unto the people

170
00:18:06,052 --> 00:18:12,219
30 And now, my beloved brethren, for ye are my

171
00:18:12,219 --> 00:18:18,386
 brethren, and ye ought to be beloved, and ye ought to

172
00:18:18,386 --> 00:18:24,553
 bring forth works which are meet for repentance,

173
00:18:24,553 --> 00:18:30,72
 seeing that your hearts have been grossly hardened

174
00:18:30,72 --> 00:18:36,887
 against the word of God, and seeing that ye are a

175
00:18:36,887 --> 00:18:43,054
 lost and a fallen people

176
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:48,805
31 Now it came to pass that when I, Alma, had

177
00:18:48,805 --> 00:18:54,555
 spoken these words, behold, the people were wroth with

178
00:18:54,555 --> 00:19:00,305
 me because I said unto them that they were a

179
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:06,055
 hard-hearted and a stiffnecked people

180
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:11,762
32 And also because I said unto them that they

181
00:19:11,762 --> 00:19:17,012
 were a lost and a fallen people they were angry with

182
00:19:17,012 --> 00:19:22,262
 me, and sought to lay their hands upon me, that

183
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:27,512
 they might cast me into prison

184
00:19:27,5 --> 00:19:30,5
33 But it came to pass that the Lord did not

185
00:19:30,5 --> 00:19:33,5
 suffer them that they should take me at that time and

186
00:19:33,5 --> 00:19:36,5
 cast me into prison

187
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:42,842
34 And it came to pass that Amulek went and stood

188
00:19:42,842 --> 00:19:48,842
 forth, and began to preach unto them also. And now

189
00:19:48,842 --> 00:19:54,842
 the words of Amulek are not all written,

190
00:19:54,842 --> 00:20:00,842
 nevertheless a part of his words are written in this book.

191
00:20:00,842 --> 00:20:06,842
