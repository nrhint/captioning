00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:10,8
Chapter 23 Religious freedom is proclaimed—The

2
00:00:10,8 --> 00:00:21,6
 Lamanites in seven lands and cities are

3
00:00:21,6 --> 00:00:32,4
 converted—They call themselves Anti-Nephi-Lehies and are freed

4
00:00:32,4 --> 00:00:43,2
 from the curse—The Amalekites and the Amulonites

5
00:00:43,2 --> 00:00:54,0
 reject the truth. About 90–77 B.C.

6
00:00:54,855 --> 00:01:13,141
1 Behold, now it came to pass that the king of the

7
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:31,427
 Lamanites sent a proclamation among all his

8
00:01:31,427 --> 00:01:49,713
 people, that they should not lay their hands on Ammon,

9
00:01:49,713 --> 00:02:07,999
 or Aaron, or Omner, or Himni, nor either of their

10
00:02:07,999 --> 00:02:26,285
 brethren who should go forth preaching the word of

11
00:02:26,285 --> 00:02:44,571
 God, in whatsoever place they should be, in any

12
00:02:44,571 --> 00:03:02,857
 part of their land

13
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:02,574
2 Yea, he sent a decree among them, that they

14
00:03:02,574 --> 00:03:02,699
 should not lay their hands on them to bind them, or to

15
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:02,824
 cast them into prison; neither should they spit

16
00:03:02,824 --> 00:03:02,949
 upon them, nor smite them, nor cast them out of

17
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:03,074
 their synagogues, nor scourge them; neither should

18
00:03:03,074 --> 00:03:03,199
 they cast stones at them, but that they should have

19
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:03,324
 free access to their houses, and also their

20
00:03:03,324 --> 00:03:03,449
 temples, and their sanctuaries

21
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:07,45
3 And thus they might go forth and preach the word

22
00:03:07,45 --> 00:03:11,617
 according to their desires, for the king had been

23
00:03:11,617 --> 00:03:15,784
 converted unto the Lord, and all his household;

24
00:03:15,784 --> 00:03:19,951
 therefore he sent his proclamation throughout the

25
00:03:19,951 --> 00:03:24,118
 land unto his people, that the word of God might

26
00:03:24,118 --> 00:03:28,285
 have no obstruction, but that it might go forth

27
00:03:28,285 --> 00:03:32,452
 throughout all the land, that his people might be

28
00:03:32,452 --> 00:03:36,619
 convinced concerning the wicked traditions of their

29
00:03:36,619 --> 00:03:40,786
 fathers, and that they might be convinced that they

30
00:03:40,786 --> 00:03:44,953
 were all brethren, and that they ought not to

31
00:03:44,953 --> 00:03:49,12
 murder, nor to plunder, nor to steal, nor to commit

32
00:03:49,12 --> 00:03:53,287
 adultery, nor to commit any manner of wickedness

33
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:59,467
4 And now it came to pass that when the king had

34
00:03:59,467 --> 00:04:05,467
 sent forth this proclamation, that Aaron and his

35
00:04:05,467 --> 00:04:11,467
 brethren went forth from city to city, and from one

36
00:04:11,467 --> 00:04:17,467
 house of worship to another, establishing

37
00:04:17,467 --> 00:04:23,467
 churches, and consecrating priests and teachers throughout

38
00:04:23,467 --> 00:04:29,467
 the land among the Lamanites, to preach and to

39
00:04:29,467 --> 00:04:35,467
 teach the word of God among them; and thus they

40
00:04:35,467 --> 00:04:41,467
 began to have great success

41
00:04:41,348 --> 00:05:08,348
5 And thousands were brought to the knowledge of

42
00:05:08,348 --> 00:05:35,348
 the Lord, yea, thousands were brought to believe in

43
00:05:35,348 --> 00:06:02,348
 the traditions of the Nephites; and they were

44
00:06:02,348 --> 00:06:29,348
 taught the records and prophecies which were handed

45
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:56,348
 down even to the present time

46
00:06:56,917 --> 00:07:03,139
6 And as sure as the Lord liveth, so sure as many

47
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:09,361
 as believed, or as many as were brought to the

48
00:07:09,361 --> 00:07:15,583
 knowledge of the truth, through the preaching of

49
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:21,805
 Ammon and his brethren, according to the spirit of

50
00:07:21,805 --> 00:07:28,027
 revelation and of prophecy, and the power of God

51
00:07:28,027 --> 00:07:34,249
 working miracles in them—yea, I say unto you, as the

52
00:07:34,249 --> 00:07:40,471
 Lord liveth, as many of the Lamanites as believed

53
00:07:40,471 --> 00:07:46,693
 in their preaching, and were converted unto the

54
00:07:46,693 --> 00:07:52,915
 Lord, never did fall away

55
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:56,739
7 For they became a righteous people; they did lay

56
00:07:56,739 --> 00:08:00,739
 down the weapons of their rebellion, that they

57
00:08:00,739 --> 00:08:04,739
 did not fight against God any more, neither against

58
00:08:04,739 --> 00:08:08,739
 any of their brethren

59
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:16,688
8 Now, these are they who were converted unto the

60
00:08:16,688 --> 00:08:24,688
 Lord

61
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:32,637
9 The people of the Lamanites who were in the land

62
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:40,637
 of Ishmael

63
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:44,587
10 And also of the people of the Lamanites who

64
00:08:44,587 --> 00:08:48,587
 were in the land of Middoni

65
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:52,561
11 And also of the people of the Lamanites who

66
00:08:52,561 --> 00:08:56,561
 were in the city of Nephi

67
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,536
12 And also of the people of the Lamanites who

68
00:08:58,536 --> 00:09:00,536
 were in the land of Shilom, and who were in the land

69
00:09:00,536 --> 00:09:02,536
 of Shemlon, and in the city of Lemuel, and in the

70
00:09:02,536 --> 00:09:04,536
 city of Shimnilom

71
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,111
13 And these are the names of the cities of the

72
00:09:06,111 --> 00:09:07,711
 Lamanites which were converted unto the Lord; and

73
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:09,311
 these are they that laid down the weapons of their

74
00:09:09,311 --> 00:09:10,911
 rebellion, yea, all their weapons of war; and they

75
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,511
 were all Lamanites

76
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:12,652
14 And the Amalekites were not converted, save

77
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:12,819
 only one; neither were any of the Amulonites; but

78
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:12,986
 they did harden their hearts, and also the hearts of

79
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:13,153
 the Lamanites in that part of the land wheresoever

80
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:13,32
 they dwelt, yea, and all their villages and all

81
00:09:13,32 --> 00:09:13,487
 their cities

82
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:16,486
15 Therefore, we have named all the cities of the

83
00:09:16,486 --> 00:09:19,819
 Lamanites in which they did repent and come to the

84
00:09:19,819 --> 00:09:23,152
 knowledge of the truth, and were converted

85
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:29,22
16 And now it came to pass that the king and those

86
00:09:29,22 --> 00:09:35,077
 who were converted were desirous that they might

87
00:09:35,077 --> 00:09:40,934
 have a name, that thereby they might be

88
00:09:40,934 --> 00:09:46,791
 distinguished from their brethren; therefore the king

89
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:52,648
 consulted with Aaron and many of their priests,

90
00:09:52,648 --> 00:09:58,505
 concerning the name that they should take upon them, that

91
00:09:58,505 --> 00:10:04,362
 they might be distinguished

92
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:11,271
17 And it came to pass that they called their

93
00:10:11,271 --> 00:10:17,938
 names Anti-Nephi-Lehies; and they were called by this

94
00:10:17,938 --> 00:10:24,605
 name and were no more called Lamanites

95
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,374
18 And they began to be a very industrious people;

96
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:26,124
 yea, and they were friendly with the Nephites;

97
00:10:26,124 --> 00:10:26,874
 therefore, they did open a correspondence with them,

98
00:10:26,874 --> 00:10:27,624
 and the curse of God did no more follow them.
