00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:19,0
Chapter 35 The preaching of the word destroys the

2
00:00:19,0 --> 00:00:38,0
 craft of the Zoramites—They expel the converts,

3
00:00:38,0 --> 00:00:57,0
 who then join the people of Ammon in Jershon—Alma

4
00:00:57,0 --> 00:01:16,0
 sorrows because of the wickedness of the people.

5
00:01:16,0 --> 00:01:35,0
 About 74 B.C.

6
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:47,696
1 Now it came to pass that after Amulek had made

7
00:01:47,696 --> 00:01:59,696
 an end of these words, they withdrew themselves

8
00:01:59,696 --> 00:02:11,696
 from the multitude and came over into the land of

9
00:02:11,696 --> 00:02:23,696
 Jershon

10
00:02:23,544 --> 00:03:32,544
2 Yea, and the rest of the brethren, after they

11
00:03:32,544 --> 00:04:41,544
 had preached the word unto the Zoramites, also came

12
00:04:41,544 --> 00:05:50,544
 over into the land of Jershon

13
00:05:50,884 --> 00:06:05,551
3 And it came to pass that after the more popular

14
00:06:05,551 --> 00:06:20,218
 part of the Zoramites had consulted together

15
00:06:20,218 --> 00:06:34,885
 concerning the words which had been preached unto them,

16
00:06:34,885 --> 00:06:49,552
 they were angry because of the word, for it did

17
00:06:49,552 --> 00:07:04,219
 destroy their craft; therefore they would not

18
00:07:04,219 --> 00:07:18,886
 hearken unto the words

19
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:42,605
4 And they sent and gathered together throughout

20
00:07:42,605 --> 00:08:06,605
 all the land all the people, and consulted with

21
00:08:06,605 --> 00:08:30,605
 them concerning the words which had been spoken

22
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:36,377
5 Now their rulers and their priests and their

23
00:08:36,377 --> 00:08:42,377
 teachers did not let the people know concerning their

24
00:08:42,377 --> 00:08:48,377
 desires; therefore they found out privily the

25
00:08:48,377 --> 00:08:54,377
 minds of all the people

26
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:55,634
6 And it came to pass that after they had found

27
00:08:55,634 --> 00:08:56,967
 out the minds of all the people, those who were in

28
00:08:56,967 --> 00:08:58,3
 favor of the words which had been spoken by Alma

29
00:08:58,3 --> 00:08:59,633
 and his brethren were cast out of the land; and they

30
00:08:59,633 --> 00:09:00,966
 were many; and they came over also into the land

31
00:09:00,966 --> 00:09:02,299
 of Jershon

32
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:41,696
9 And he breathed out many threatenings against

33
00:01:41,696 --> 00:01:47,696
 them. And now the people of Ammon did not fear their

34
00:01:47,696 --> 00:01:53,696
 words; therefore they did not cast them out, but

35
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:59,696
 they did receive all the poor of the Zoramites

36
00:01:59,696 --> 00:02:05,696
 that came over unto them; and they did nourish them,

37
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:11,696
 and did clothe them, and did give unto them lands

38
00:02:11,696 --> 00:02:17,696
 for their inheritance; and they did administer

39
00:02:17,696 --> 00:02:23,696
 unto them according to their wants

40
00:02:23,544 --> 00:03:15,294
10 Now this did stir up the Zoramites to anger

41
00:03:15,294 --> 00:04:07,044
 against the people of Ammon, and they began to mix

42
00:04:07,044 --> 00:04:58,794
 with the Lamanites and to stir them up also to anger

43
00:04:58,794 --> 00:05:50,544
 against them

44
00:05:50,884 --> 00:06:20,217
11 And thus the Zoramites and the Lamanites began

45
00:06:20,217 --> 00:06:49,55
 to make preparations for war against the people of

46
00:06:49,55 --> 00:07:18,883
 Ammon, and also against the Nephites

47
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:54,605
12 And thus ended the seventeenth year of the

48
00:07:54,605 --> 00:08:30,605
 reign of the judges over the people of Nephi

49
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:33,044
13 And the people of Ammon departed out of the

50
00:08:33,044 --> 00:08:35,711
 land of Jershon, and came over into the land of

51
00:08:35,711 --> 00:08:38,378
 Melek, and gave place in the land of Jershon for the

52
00:08:38,378 --> 00:08:41,045
 armies of the Nephites, that they might contend with

53
00:08:41,045 --> 00:08:43,712
 the armies of the Lamanites and the armies of the

54
00:08:43,712 --> 00:08:46,379
 Zoramites; and thus commenced a war betwixt the

55
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:49,046
 Lamanites and the Nephites, in the eighteenth year

56
00:08:49,046 --> 00:08:51,713
 of the reign of the judges; and an account shall

57
00:08:51,713 --> 00:08:54,38
 be given of their wars hereafter

58
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:55,19
14 And Alma, and Ammon, and their brethren, and

59
00:08:55,19 --> 00:08:56,079
 also the two sons of Alma returned to the land of

60
00:08:56,079 --> 00:08:56,968
 Zarahemla, after having been instruments in the

61
00:08:56,968 --> 00:08:57,857
 hands of God of bringing many of the Zoramites to

62
00:08:57,857 --> 00:08:58,746
 repentance; and as many as were brought to repentance

63
00:08:58,746 --> 00:08:59,635
 were driven out of their land; but they have lands

64
00:08:59,635 --> 00:09:00,524
 for their inheritance in the land of Jershon, and

65
00:09:00,524 --> 00:09:01,413
 they have taken up arms to defend themselves, and

66
00:09:01,413 --> 00:09:02,302
 their wives, and children, and their lands
