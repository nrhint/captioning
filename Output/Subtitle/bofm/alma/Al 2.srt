00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 2 Amlici seeks to be king and is

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
rejected by the voice of the people—His

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
followers make him king—The Amlicites make

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
war on the Nephites and are defeated—The

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Lamanites and Amlicites join forces and

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:03:45,
are defeated—Alma slays Amlici. About 87 B.C. 

7
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
1 And it came to pass in the

8
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
commencement of the fifth year of their reign

9
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
there began to be a contention among

10
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
the people; for a certain man, being

11
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
called Amlici, he being a very cunning

12
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
man, yea, a wise man as to the wisdom of

13
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
the world, he being after the order

14
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
of the man that slew Gideon by the

15
00:03:45,0 --> 00:07:16,
sword, who was executed according to the law—

16
00:07:16,0 --> 00:07:16,0
2 Now this Amlici had, by his

17
00:07:16,0 --> 00:07:16,0
cunning, drawn away much people

18
00:07:16,0 --> 00:07:16,0
after him; even so much that they

19
00:07:16,0 --> 00:07:16,0
began to be very powerful; and they

20
00:07:16,0 --> 00:07:16,0
began to endeavor to establish

21
00:07:16,0 --> 00:14:24,
Amlici to be a king over the people.

22
00:14:24,0 --> 00:14:24,0
3 Now this was alarming to the

23
00:14:24,0 --> 00:14:24,0
people of the church, and

24
00:14:24,0 --> 00:14:24,0
also to all those who had not

25
00:14:24,0 --> 00:14:24,0
been drawn away after the

26
00:14:24,0 --> 00:14:24,0
persuasions of Amlici; for they knew

27
00:14:24,0 --> 00:14:24,0
that according to their law

28
00:14:24,0 --> 00:14:24,0
that such things must be

29
00:14:24,0 --> 00:13:56,
established by the voice of the people.

30
00:13:56,0 --> 00:13:56,0
4 Therefore, if it were

31
00:13:56,0 --> 00:13:56,0
possible that Amlici should

32
00:13:56,0 --> 00:13:56,0
gain the voice of the people,

33
00:13:56,0 --> 00:13:56,0
he, being a wicked man,

34
00:13:56,0 --> 00:13:56,0
would deprive them of their

35
00:13:56,0 --> 00:13:56,0
rights and privileges of the

36
00:13:56,0 --> 00:13:56,0
church; for it was his

37
00:13:56,0 --> 00:14:40,
intent to destroy the church of God.

38
00:14:40,0 --> 00:14:40,0
5 And it came to pass

39
00:14:40,0 --> 00:14:40,0
that the people assembled

40
00:14:40,0 --> 00:14:40,0
themselves together

41
00:14:40,0 --> 00:14:40,0
throughout all the land,

42
00:14:40,0 --> 00:14:40,0
every man according to his

43
00:14:40,0 --> 00:14:40,0
mind, whether it were

44
00:14:40,0 --> 00:14:40,0
for or against Amlici, in

45
00:14:40,0 --> 00:14:40,0
separate bodies, having

46
00:14:40,0 --> 00:14:40,0
much dispute and

47
00:14:40,0 --> 00:14:12,
wonderful contentions one with another.

48
00:14:12,0 --> 00:14:12,0
6 And thus they did

49
00:14:12,0 --> 00:14:12,0
assemble themselves

50
00:14:12,0 --> 00:14:12,0
together to cast in their

51
00:14:12,0 --> 00:14:12,0
voices concerning the

52
00:14:12,0 --> 00:14:12,0
matter; and they were

53
00:14:12,0 --> 00:18:54,
laid before the judges.

54
00:18:54,0 --> 00:18:54,0
7 And it came to

55
00:18:54,0 --> 00:18:54,0
pass that the voice

56
00:18:54,0 --> 00:18:54,0
of the people came

57
00:18:54,0 --> 00:18:54,0
against Amlici, that

58
00:18:54,0 --> 00:18:54,0
he was not made

59
00:18:54,0 --> 00:22:25,
king over the people.

60
00:22:25,0 --> 00:22:25,0
8 Now this did

61
00:22:25,0 --> 00:22:25,0
cause much joy in

62
00:22:25,0 --> 00:22:25,0
the hearts of

63
00:22:25,0 --> 00:22:25,0
those who were

64
00:22:25,0 --> 00:22:25,0
against him; but Amlici

65
00:22:25,0 --> 00:22:25,0
did stir up

66
00:22:25,0 --> 00:22:25,0
those who were in his

67
00:22:25,0 --> 00:22:25,0
favor to anger

68
00:22:25,0 --> 00:22:25,0
against those who

69
00:22:25,0 --> 00:24:09,
were not in his favor.

70
00:24:09,0 --> 00:24:09,0
9 And it came

71
00:24:09,0 --> 00:24:09,0
to pass that

72
00:24:09,0 --> 00:24:09,0
they gathered

73
00:24:09,0 --> 00:24:09,0
themselves

74
00:24:09,0 --> 00:24:09,0
together, and did

75
00:24:09,0 --> 00:24:09,0
consecrate Amlici to

76
00:24:09,0 --> 00:26:21,
be their king.

77
00:26:21,0 --> 00:26:21,0
10 Now when

78
00:26:21,0 --> 00:26:21,0
Amlici was made

79
00:26:21,0 --> 00:26:21,0
king over them he

80
00:26:21,0 --> 00:26:21,0
commanded them

81
00:26:21,0 --> 00:26:21,0
that they

82
00:26:21,0 --> 00:26:21,0
should take up arms

83
00:26:21,0 --> 00:26:21,0
against their

84
00:26:21,0 --> 00:26:21,0
brethren; and

85
00:26:21,0 --> 00:26:21,0
this he did that

86
00:26:21,0 --> 00:26:21,0
he might

87
00:26:21,0 --> 00:29:51,
subject them to him.

88
00:29:51,0 --> 00:29:51,0
11 Now the

89
00:29:51,0 --> 00:29:51,0
people of Amlici

90
00:29:51,0 --> 00:29:51,0
were

91
00:29:51,0 --> 00:29:51,0
distinguished by the

92
00:29:51,0 --> 00:29:51,0
name of Amlici,

93
00:29:51,0 --> 00:29:51,0
being called

94
00:29:51,0 --> 00:29:51,0
Amlicites; and

95
00:29:51,0 --> 00:29:51,0
the remainder

96
00:29:51,0 --> 00:29:51,0
were called

97
00:29:51,0 --> 00:29:51,0
Nephites, or the

98
00:29:51,0 --> 00:29:23,
people of God.

99
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
12 Therefore

100
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
the people of

101
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
the Nephites

102
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
were aware of

103
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
the intent of

104
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
the Amlicites,

105
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
and therefore

106
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
they did

107
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
prepare to meet

108
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
them; yea, they

109
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
did arm

110
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
themselves with

111
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
swords, and with

112
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
cimeters, and

113
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
with bows, and

114
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
with arrows, and

115
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
with stones,

116
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
and with

117
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
slings, and with

118
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
all manner of

119
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
weapons of war,

120
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,
of every kind.

121
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
13 And thus

122
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
they were

123
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
prepared to meet

124
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
the Amlicites

125
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
at the time

126
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
of their

127
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
coming. And there

128
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
were

129
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
appointed captains,

130
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
and higher

131
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
captains, and

132
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
chief

133
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
captains, according

134
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,
to their numbers.

135
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
14 And it

136
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
came to pass

137
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
that Amlici

138
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
did arm his

139
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
men with all

140
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
manner of

141
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
weapons of war

142
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
of every

143
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
kind; and he

144
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
also

145
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
appointed rulers and

146
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
leaders

147
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
over his

148
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
people, to lead

149
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
them to war

150
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,
against their brethren.

151
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
15 And it

152
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
came to pass

153
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
that the

154
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
Amlicites

155
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
came upon the

156
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
hill

157
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
Amnihu, which

158
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
was east of

159
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
the river

160
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
Sidon, which

161
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
ran by the

162
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
land of

163
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
Zarahemla, and

164
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
there they

165
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
began to

166
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,
make war with the Nephites.

167
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
16 Now

168
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
Alma, being

169
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
the chief

170
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
judge and

171
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
the

172
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
governor of the

173
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
people of

174
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
Nephi,

175
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
therefore he

176
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
went up

177
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
with his

178
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
people, yea,

179
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
with his

180
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
captains,

181
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
and chief

182
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
captains,

183
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
yea, at the

184
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
head of

185
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
his armies,

186
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
against

187
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,
the Amlicites to battle.

188
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
17 And

189
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
they began

190
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
to slay

191
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
the

192
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
Amlicites upon

193
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
the hill

194
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
east of

195
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
Sidon. And

196
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
the

197
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
Amlicites did

198
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
contend

199
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
with the

200
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
Nephites

201
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
with

202
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
great

203
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
strength,

204
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
insomuch that

205
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
many of

206
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
the

207
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
Nephites did

208
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,
fall before the Amlicites.

209
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
18

210
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
Nevertheless

211
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
the Lord

212
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
did

213
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
strengthen the

214
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
hand of

215
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
the

216
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
Nephites, that

217
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
they slew

218
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
the

219
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
Amlicites with

220
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
great

221
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
slaughter,

222
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
that they

223
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
began to

224
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
flee

225
