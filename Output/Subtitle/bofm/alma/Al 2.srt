00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:08,0
Chapter 2 Amlici seeks to be king and is

2
00:00:08,0 --> 00:00:16,0
rejected by the voice of the people—His

3
00:00:16,0 --> 00:00:24,0
followers make him king—The Amlicites make

4
00:00:24,0 --> 00:00:32,0
war on the Nephites and are defeated—The

5
00:00:32,0 --> 00:00:40,0
Lamanites and Amlicites join forces and

6
00:00:40,0 --> 00:00:48,282
are defeated—Alma slays Amlici. About 87 B.C. 

7
00:00:48,282 --> 00:00:48,171
1 And it came to pass in the

8
00:00:48,171 --> 00:00:48,06
commencement of the fifth year of their reign

9
00:00:48,06 --> 00:00:47,949
there began to be a contention among

10
00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:47,838
the people; for a certain man, being

11
00:00:47,838 --> 00:00:47,727
called Amlici, he being a very cunning

12
00:00:47,727 --> 00:00:47,616
man, yea, a wise man as to the wisdom of

13
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:47,505
the world, he being after the order

14
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:47,394
of the man that slew Gideon by the

15
00:00:47,394 --> 00:00:47,347
sword, who was executed according to the law—

16
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:47,514
2 Now this Amlici had, by his

17
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:47,681
cunning, drawn away much people

18
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:47,848
after him; even so much that they

19
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:48,015
began to be very powerful; and they

20
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:48,182
began to endeavor to establish

21
00:00:48,182 --> 00:00:48,815
Amlici to be a king over the people.

22
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:48,69
3 Now this was alarming to the

23
00:00:48,69 --> 00:00:48,565
people of the church, and

24
00:00:48,565 --> 00:00:48,44
also to all those who had not

25
00:00:48,44 --> 00:00:48,315
been drawn away after the

26
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:48,19
persuasions of Amlici; for they knew

27
00:00:48,19 --> 00:00:48,065
that according to their law

28
00:00:48,065 --> 00:00:47,94
that such things must be

29
00:00:47,94 --> 00:00:47,881
established by the voice of the people.

30
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:47,881
4 Therefore, if it were

31
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:47,881
possible that Amlici should

32
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:47,881
gain the voice of the people,

33
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:47,881
he, being a wicked man,

34
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:47,881
would deprive them of their

35
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:47,881
rights and privileges of the

36
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:47,881
church; for it was his

37
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:47,414
intent to destroy the church of God.

38
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:47,614
5 And it came to pass

39
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:47,814
that the people assembled

40
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:48,014
themselves together

41
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:48,214
throughout all the land,

42
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:48,414
every man according to his

43
00:00:48,414 --> 00:00:48,614
mind, whether it were

44
00:00:48,614 --> 00:00:48,814
for or against Amlici, in

45
00:00:48,814 --> 00:00:49,014
separate bodies, having

46
00:00:49,014 --> 00:00:49,214
much dispute and

47
00:00:49,214 --> 00:00:49,349
wonderful contentions one with another.

48
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:49,182
6 And thus they did

49
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:49,015
assemble themselves

50
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:48,848
together to cast in their

51
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:48,681
voices concerning the

52
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:48,514
matter; and they were

53
00:00:48,514 --> 00:00:48,415
laid before the judges.

54
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:48,248
7 And it came to

55
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:48,081
pass that the voice

56
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:47,914
of the people came

57
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:47,747
against Amlici, that

58
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:47,58
he was not made

59
00:00:47,58 --> 00:00:47,481
king over the people.

60
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:47,681
8 Now this did

61
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:47,881
cause much joy in

62
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:48,081
the hearts of

63
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:48,281
those who were

64
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:48,481
against him; but Amlici

65
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:48,681
did stir up

66
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:48,881
those who were in his

67
00:00:48,881 --> 00:00:49,081
favor to anger

68
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:49,281
against those who

69
00:00:49,281 --> 00:00:49,416
were not in his favor.

70
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:49,273
9 And it came

71
00:00:49,273 --> 00:00:49,13
to pass that

72
00:00:49,13 --> 00:00:48,987
they gathered

73
00:00:48,987 --> 00:00:48,844
themselves

74
00:00:48,844 --> 00:00:48,701
together, and did

75
00:00:48,701 --> 00:00:48,558
consecrate Amlici to

76
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:48,482
be their king.

77
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:48,391
10 Now when

78
00:00:48,391 --> 00:00:48,3
Amlici was made

79
00:00:48,3 --> 00:00:48,209
king over them he

80
00:00:48,209 --> 00:00:48,118
commanded them

81
00:00:48,118 --> 00:00:48,027
that they

82
00:00:48,027 --> 00:00:47,936
should take up arms

83
00:00:47,936 --> 00:00:47,845
against their

84
00:00:47,845 --> 00:00:47,754
brethren; and

85
00:00:47,754 --> 00:00:47,663
this he did that

86
00:00:47,663 --> 00:00:47,572
he might

87
00:00:47,572 --> 00:00:47,547
subject them to him.

88
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:47,73
11 Now the

89
00:00:47,73 --> 00:00:47,911
people of Amlici

90
00:00:47,911 --> 00:00:48,093
were

91
00:00:48,093 --> 00:00:48,276
distinguished by the

92
00:00:48,276 --> 00:00:48,457
name of Amlici,

93
00:00:48,457 --> 00:00:48,639
being called

94
00:00:48,639 --> 00:00:48,822
Amlicites; and

95
00:00:48,822 --> 00:00:49,004
the remainder

96
00:00:49,004 --> 00:00:49,185
were called

97
00:00:49,185 --> 00:00:49,367
Nephites, or the

98
00:00:49,367 --> 00:00:49,95
people of God.

99
00:00:49,95 --> 00:00:49,95
12 Therefore

100
00:00:49,95 --> 00:00:49,95
the people of

101
00:00:49,95 --> 00:00:49,95
the Nephites

102
00:00:49,95 --> 00:00:49,95
were aware of

103
00:00:49,95 --> 00:00:49,95
the intent of

104
00:00:49,95 --> 00:00:49,95
the Amlicites,

105
00:00:49,95 --> 00:00:49,95
and therefore

106
00:00:49,95 --> 00:00:49,95
they did

107
00:00:49,95 --> 00:00:49,95
prepare to meet

108
00:00:49,95 --> 00:00:49,95
them; yea, they

109
00:00:49,95 --> 00:00:49,95
did arm

110
00:00:49,95 --> 00:00:49,95
themselves with

111
00:00:49,95 --> 00:00:49,95
swords, and with

112
00:00:49,95 --> 00:00:49,95
cimeters, and

113
00:00:49,95 --> 00:00:49,95
with bows, and

114
00:00:49,95 --> 00:00:49,95
with arrows, and

115
00:00:49,95 --> 00:00:49,95
with stones,

116
00:00:49,95 --> 00:00:49,95
and with

117
00:00:49,95 --> 00:00:49,95
slings, and with

118
00:00:49,95 --> 00:00:49,95
all manner of

119
00:00:49,95 --> 00:00:49,95
weapons of war,

120
00:00:49,95 --> 00:00:49,016
of every kind.

121
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:48,945
13 And thus

122
00:00:48,945 --> 00:00:48,874
they were

123
00:00:48,874 --> 00:00:48,803
prepared to meet

124
00:00:48,803 --> 00:00:48,732
the Amlicites

125
00:00:48,732 --> 00:00:48,661
at the time

126
00:00:48,661 --> 00:00:48,59
of their

127
00:00:48,59 --> 00:00:48,519
coming. And there

128
00:00:48,519 --> 00:00:48,448
were

129
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:48,377
appointed captains,

130
00:00:48,377 --> 00:00:48,306
and higher

131
00:00:48,306 --> 00:00:48,235
captains, and

132
00:00:48,235 --> 00:00:48,164
chief

133
00:00:48,164 --> 00:00:48,093
captains, according

134
00:00:48,093 --> 00:00:48,081
to their numbers.

135
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:48,081
14 And it

136
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:48,081
came to pass

137
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:48,081
that Amlici

138
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:48,081
did arm his

139
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:48,081
men with all

140
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:48,081
manner of

141
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:48,081
weapons of war

142
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:48,081
of every

143
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:48,081
kind; and he

144
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:48,081
also

145
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:48,081
appointed rulers and

146
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:48,081
leaders

147
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:48,081
over his

148
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:48,081
people, to lead

149
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:48,081
them to war

150
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:48,549
against their brethren.

151
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:48,487
15 And it

152
00:00:48,487 --> 00:00:48,425
came to pass

153
00:00:48,425 --> 00:00:48,363
that the

154
00:00:48,363 --> 00:00:48,301
Amlicites

155
00:00:48,301 --> 00:00:48,239
came upon the

156
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:48,177
hill

157
00:00:48,177 --> 00:00:48,115
Amnihu, which

158
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:48,053
was east of

159
00:00:48,053 --> 00:00:47,991
the river

160
00:00:47,991 --> 00:00:47,929
Sidon, which

161
00:00:47,929 --> 00:00:47,867
ran by the

162
00:00:47,867 --> 00:00:47,805
land of

163
00:00:47,805 --> 00:00:47,743
Zarahemla, and

164
00:00:47,743 --> 00:00:47,681
there they

165
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:47,619
began to

166
00:00:47,619 --> 00:00:47,614
make war with the Nephites.

167
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:47,757
16 Now

168
00:00:47,757 --> 00:00:47,9
Alma, being

169
00:00:47,9 --> 00:00:48,043
the chief

170
00:00:48,043 --> 00:00:48,186
judge and

171
00:00:48,186 --> 00:00:48,329
the

172
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:48,472
governor of the

173
00:00:48,472 --> 00:00:48,615
people of

174
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:48,758
Nephi,

175
00:00:48,758 --> 00:00:48,901
therefore he

176
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:49,044
went up

177
00:00:49,044 --> 00:00:49,187
with his

178
00:00:49,187 --> 00:00:49,33
people, yea,

179
00:00:49,33 --> 00:00:49,473
with his

180
00:00:49,473 --> 00:00:49,616
captains,

181
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:49,759
and chief

182
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:49,902
captains,

183
00:00:49,902 --> 00:00:50,045
yea, at the

184
00:00:50,045 --> 00:00:50,188
head of

185
00:00:50,188 --> 00:00:50,331
his armies,

186
00:00:50,331 --> 00:00:50,474
against

187
00:00:50,474 --> 00:00:50,017
the Amlicites to battle.

188
00:00:50,017 --> 00:00:49,969
17 And

189
00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:49,921
they began

190
00:00:49,921 --> 00:00:49,873
to slay

191
00:00:49,873 --> 00:00:49,825
the

192
00:00:49,825 --> 00:00:49,777
Amlicites upon

193
00:00:49,777 --> 00:00:49,729
the hill

194
00:00:49,729 --> 00:00:49,681
east of

195
00:00:49,681 --> 00:00:49,633
Sidon. And

196
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:49,585
the

197
00:00:49,585 --> 00:00:49,537
Amlicites did

198
00:00:49,537 --> 00:00:49,489
contend

199
00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:49,441
with the

200
00:00:49,441 --> 00:00:49,393
Nephites

201
00:00:49,393 --> 00:00:49,345
with

202
00:00:49,345 --> 00:00:49,297
great

203
00:00:49,297 --> 00:00:49,249
strength,
