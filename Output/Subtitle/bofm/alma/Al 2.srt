00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:08,833
Chapter 2 Amlici seeks to be king and is rejected

2
00:00:08,833 --> 00:00:17,666
 by the voice of the people—His followers make him

3
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:26,499
 king—The Amlicites make war on the Nephites and

4
00:00:26,499 --> 00:00:35,332
 are defeated—The Lamanites and Amlicites join forces

5
00:00:35,332 --> 00:00:44,165
 and are defeated—Alma slays Amlici. About 87 B.C.

6
00:00:44,165 --> 00:00:52,998


7
00:00:53,854 --> 00:00:59,997
1 And it came to pass in the commencement of the

8
00:00:59,997 --> 00:01:06,14
 fifth year of their reign there began to be a

9
00:01:06,14 --> 00:01:12,283
 contention among the people; for a certain man, being

10
00:01:12,283 --> 00:01:18,426
 called Amlici, he being a very cunning man, yea, a

11
00:01:18,426 --> 00:01:24,569
 wise man as to the wisdom of the world, he being

12
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:30,712
 after the order of the man that slew Gideon by the

13
00:01:30,712 --> 00:01:36,855
 sword, who was executed according to the law

14
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:43,313
2 Now this Amlici had, by his cunning, drawn away

15
00:01:43,313 --> 00:01:50,563
 much people after him; even so much that they

16
00:01:50,563 --> 00:01:57,813
 began to be very powerful; and they began to endeavor

17
00:01:57,813 --> 00:02:05,063
 to establish Amlici to be a king over the people

18
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,159
3 Now this was alarming to the people of the

19
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:16,559
 church, and also to all those who had not been drawn

20
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:21,959
 away after the persuasions of Amlici; for they knew

21
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:27,359
 that according to their law that such things must

22
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:32,759
 be established by the voice of the people

23
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:37,719
4 Therefore, if it were possible that Amlici

24
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:43,119
 should gain the voice of the people, he, being a wicked

25
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:48,519
 man, would deprive them of their rights and

26
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:53,919
 privileges of the church; for it was his intent to

27
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:59,319
 destroy the church of God

28
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:04,546
5 And it came to pass that the people assembled

29
00:03:04,546 --> 00:03:09,946
 themselves together throughout all the land, every

30
00:03:09,946 --> 00:03:15,346
 man according to his mind, whether it were for or

31
00:03:15,346 --> 00:03:20,746
 against Amlici, in separate bodies, having much

32
00:03:20,746 --> 00:03:26,146
 dispute and wonderful contentions one with another

33
00:03:26,84 --> 00:03:31,507
6 And thus they did assemble themselves together

34
00:03:31,507 --> 00:03:36,174
 to cast in their voices concerning the matter; and

35
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:40,841
 they were laid before the judges

36
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:45,521
7 And it came to pass that the voice of the people

37
00:03:45,521 --> 00:03:50,188
 came against Amlici, that he was not made king

38
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:54,855
 over the people

39
00:03:54,634 --> 00:04:00,134
8 Now this did cause much joy in the hearts of

40
00:04:00,134 --> 00:04:05,634
 those who were against him; but Amlici did stir up

41
00:04:05,634 --> 00:04:11,134
 those who were in his favor to anger against those

42
00:04:11,134 --> 00:04:16,634
 who were not in his favor

43
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:19,689
9 And it came to pass that they gathered

44
00:04:19,689 --> 00:04:23,022
 themselves together, and did consecrate Amlici to be their

45
00:04:23,022 --> 00:04:26,355
 king

46
00:04:26,9 --> 00:04:33,15
10 Now when Amlici was made king over them he

47
00:04:33,15 --> 00:04:39,4
 commanded them that they should take up arms against

48
00:04:39,4 --> 00:04:45,65
 their brethren; and this he did that he might

49
00:04:45,65 --> 00:04:51,9
 subject them to him

50
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:58,658
11 Now the people of Amlici were distinguished by

51
00:04:58,658 --> 00:05:05,658
 the name of Amlici, being called Amlicites; and

52
00:05:05,658 --> 00:05:12,658
 the remainder were called Nephites, or the people of

53
00:05:12,658 --> 00:05:19,658
 God

54
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:25,057
12 Therefore the people of the Nephites were aware

55
00:05:25,057 --> 00:05:30,628
 of the intent of the Amlicites, and therefore

56
00:05:30,628 --> 00:05:36,199
 they did prepare to meet them; yea, they did arm

57
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:41,77
 themselves with swords, and with cimeters, and with

58
00:05:41,77 --> 00:05:47,341
 bows, and with arrows, and with stones, and with

59
00:05:47,341 --> 00:05:52,912
 slings, and with all manner of weapons of war, of

60
00:05:52,912 --> 00:05:58,483
 every kind

61
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:03,641
13 And thus they were prepared to meet the

62
00:06:03,641 --> 00:06:08,891
 Amlicites at the time of their coming. And there were

63
00:06:08,891 --> 00:06:14,141
 appointed captains, and higher captains, and chief

64
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:19,391
 captains, according to their numbers

65
00:06:19,88 --> 00:06:25,079
14 And it came to pass that Amlici did arm his men

66
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:30,279
 with all manner of weapons of war of every kind;

67
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:35,48
 and he also appointed rulers and leaders over his

68
00:06:35,48 --> 00:06:40,68
 people, to lead them to war against their

69
00:06:40,68 --> 00:06:45,88
 brethren

70
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:51,855
15 And it came to pass that the Amlicites came

71
00:06:51,855 --> 00:06:58,105
 upon the hill Amnihu, which was east of the river

72
00:06:58,105 --> 00:07:04,355
 Sidon, which ran by the land of Zarahemla, and there

73
00:07:04,355 --> 00:07:10,605
 they began to make war with the Nephites

74
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:17,064
16 Now Alma, being the chief judge and the

75
00:07:17,064 --> 00:07:23,264
 governor of the people of Nephi, therefore he went up

76
00:07:23,264 --> 00:07:29,464
 with his people, yea, with his captains, and chief

77
00:07:29,464 --> 00:07:35,664
 captains, yea, at the head of his armies, against

78
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:41,864
 the Amlicites to battle

79
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:47,361
17 And they began to slay the Amlicites upon the

80
00:07:47,361 --> 00:07:53,161
 hill east of Sidon. And the Amlicites did contend

81
00:07:53,161 --> 00:07:58,961
 with the Nephites with great strength, insomuch

82
00:07:58,961 --> 00:08:04,761
 that many of the Nephites did fall before the

83
00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:10,561
 Amlicites

84
00:08:10,59 --> 00:08:16,09
18 Nevertheless the Lord did strengthen the hand

85
00:08:16,09 --> 00:08:21,59
 of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with

86
00:08:21,59 --> 00:08:27,09
 great slaughter, that they began to flee before

87
00:08:27,09 --> 00:08:32,59
 them

88
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:37,703
19 And it came to pass that the Nephites did

89
00:08:37,703 --> 00:08:42,56
 pursue the Amlicites all that day, and did slay them

90
00:08:42,56 --> 00:08:47,417
 with much slaughter, insomuch that there were slain

91
00:08:47,417 --> 00:08:52,274
 of the Amlicites twelve thousand five hundred

92
00:08:52,274 --> 00:08:57,131
 thirty and two souls; and there were slain of the

93
00:08:57,131 --> 00:09:01,988
 Nephites six thousand five hundred sixty and two

94
00:09:01,988 --> 00:09:06,845
 souls

95
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:12,989
20 And it came to pass that when Alma could pursue

96
00:09:12,989 --> 00:09:19,132
 the Amlicites no longer he caused that his people

97
00:09:19,132 --> 00:09:25,275
 should pitch their tents in the valley of Gideon,

98
00:09:25,275 --> 00:09:31,418
 the valley being called after that Gideon who was

99
00:09:31,418 --> 00:09:37,561
 slain by the hand of Nehor with the sword; and in

100
00:09:37,561 --> 00:09:43,704
 this valley the Nephites did pitch their tents

101
00:09:43,704 --> 00:09:49,847
 for the night

102
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:55,556
21 And Alma sent spies to follow the remnant of

103
00:09:55,556 --> 00:10:01,356
 the Amlicites, that he might know of their plans and

104
00:10:01,356 --> 00:10:07,156
 their plots, whereby he might guard himself

105
00:10:07,156 --> 00:10:12,956
 against them, that he might preserve his people from

106
00:10:12,956 --> 00:10:18,756
 being destroyed

107
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:24,151
22 Now those whom he had sent out to watch the

108
00:10:24,151 --> 00:10:29,751
 camp of the Amlicites were called Zeram, and Amnor,

109
00:10:29,751 --> 00:10:35,351
 and Manti, and Limher; these were they who went out

110
00:10:35,351 --> 00:10:40,951
 with their men to watch the camp of the

111
00:10:40,951 --> 00:10:46,551
 Amlicites

112
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:50,979
23 And it came to pass that on the morrow they

113
00:10:50,979 --> 00:10:55,479
 returned into the camp of the Nephites in great

114
00:10:55,479 --> 00:10:59,979
 haste, being greatly astonished, and struck with much

115
00:10:59,979 --> 00:11:04,479
 fear, saying

116
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:09,531
24 Behold, we followed the camp of the Amlicites,

117
00:11:09,531 --> 00:11:14,531
 and to our great astonishment, in the land of

118
00:11:14,531 --> 00:11:19,531
 Minon, above the land of Zarahemla, in the course of

119
00:11:19,531 --> 00:11:24,531
 the land of Nephi, we saw a numerous host of the

120
00:11:24,531 --> 00:11:29,531
 Lamanites; and behold, the Amlicites have joined

121
00:11:29,531 --> 00:11:34,531
 them

122
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:40,827
25 And they are upon our brethren in that land;

123
00:11:40,827 --> 00:11:47,16
 and they are fleeing before them with their flocks,

124
00:11:47,16 --> 00:11:53,493
 and their wives, and their children, towards our

125
00:11:53,493 --> 00:11:59,826
 city; and except we make haste they obtain

126
00:11:59,826 --> 00:12:06,159
 possession of our city, and our fathers, and our wives,

127
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:12,492
 and our children be slain

128
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:17,432
26 And it came to pass that the people of Nephi

129
00:12:17,432 --> 00:12:21,932
 took their tents, and departed out of the valley of

130
00:12:21,932 --> 00:12:26,432
 Gideon towards their city, which was the city of

131
00:12:26,432 --> 00:12:30,932
 Zarahemla

132
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:37,667
27 And behold, as they were crossing the river

133
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:44,417
 Sidon, the Lamanites and the Amlicites, being as

134
00:12:44,417 --> 00:12:51,167
 numerous almost, as it were, as the sands of the sea,

135
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:57,917
 came upon them to destroy them

136
00:12:57,644 --> 00:13:04,311
28 Nevertheless, the Nephites being strengthened

137
00:13:04,311 --> 00:13:10,978
 by the hand of the Lord, having prayed mightily to

138
00:13:10,978 --> 00:13:17,645
 him that he would deliver them out of the hands of

139
00:13:17,645 --> 00:13:24,312
 their enemies, therefore the Lord did hear their

140
00:13:24,312 --> 00:13:30,979
 cries, and did strengthen them, and the Lamanites

141
00:13:30,979 --> 00:13:37,646
 and the Amlicites did fall before them

142
00:13:37,05 --> 00:13:41,383
29 And it came to pass that Alma fought with

143
00:13:41,383 --> 00:13:45,716
 Amlici with the sword, face to face; and they did

144
00:13:45,716 --> 00:13:50,049
 contend mightily, one with another

145
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:56,263
30 And it came to pass that Alma, being a man of

146
00:13:56,263 --> 00:14:02,463
 God, being exercised with much faith, cried,

147
00:14:02,463 --> 00:14:08,663
 saying: O Lord, have mercy and spare my life, that I may

148
00:14:08,663 --> 00:14:14,863
 be an instrument in thy hands to save and

149
00:14:14,863 --> 00:14:21,063
 preserve this people

150
00:14:21,26 --> 00:14:27,927
31 Now when Alma had said these words he contended

151
00:14:27,927 --> 00:14:34,594
 again with Amlici; and he was strengthened,

152
00:14:34,594 --> 00:14:41,261
 insomuch that he slew Amlici with the sword

153
00:14:41,28 --> 00:14:46,53
32 And he also contended with the king of the

154
00:14:46,53 --> 00:14:51,78
 Lamanites; but the king of the Lamanites fled back

155
00:14:51,78 --> 00:14:57,03
 from before Alma and sent his guards to contend with

156
00:14:57,03 --> 00:15:02,28
 Alma

157
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:09,436
33 But Alma, with his guards, contended with the

158
00:15:09,436 --> 00:15:16,103
 guards of the king of the Lamanites until he slew

159
00:15:16,103 --> 00:15:22,77
 and drove them back

160
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:28,436
34 And thus he cleared the ground, or rather the

161
00:15:28,436 --> 00:15:34,15
 bank, which was on the west of the river Sidon,

162
00:15:34,15 --> 00:15:39,864
 throwing the bodies of the Lamanites who had been

163
00:15:39,864 --> 00:15:45,578
 slain into the waters of Sidon, that thereby his

164
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:51,292
 people might have room to cross and contend with the

165
00:15:51,292 --> 00:15:57,006
 Lamanites and the Amlicites on the west side of the

166
00:15:57,006 --> 00:16:02,72
 river Sidon

167
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:08,328
35 And it came to pass that when they had all

168
00:16:08,328 --> 00:16:13,928
 crossed the river Sidon that the Lamanites and the

169
00:16:13,928 --> 00:16:19,528
 Amlicites began to flee before them, notwithstanding

170
00:16:19,528 --> 00:16:25,128
 they were so numerous that they could not be

171
00:16:25,128 --> 00:16:30,728
 numbered

172
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:36,923
36 And they fled before the Nephites towards the

173
00:16:36,923 --> 00:16:43,423
 wilderness which was west and north, away beyond

174
00:16:43,423 --> 00:16:49,923
 the borders of the land; and the Nephites did pursue

175
00:16:49,923 --> 00:16:56,423
 them with their might, and did slay them

176
00:16:56,916 --> 00:17:03,083
37 Yea, they were met on every hand, and slain and

177
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:09,25
 driven, until they were scattered on the west,

178
00:17:09,25 --> 00:17:15,417
 and on the north, until they had reached the

179
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:21,584
 wilderness, which was called Hermounts; and it was that

180
00:17:21,584 --> 00:17:27,751
 part of the wilderness which was infested by wild

181
00:17:27,751 --> 00:17:33,918
 and ravenous beasts

182
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:38,453
38 And it came to pass that many died in the

183
00:17:38,453 --> 00:17:43,253
 wilderness of their wounds, and were devoured by those

184
00:17:43,253 --> 00:17:48,053
 beasts and also the vultures of the air; and their

185
00:17:48,053 --> 00:17:52,853
 bones have been found, and have been heaped up on

186
00:17:52,853 --> 00:17:57,653
 the earth.
