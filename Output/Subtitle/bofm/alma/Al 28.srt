00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:10,0
Chapter 28 The Lamanites are defeated in a

2
00:00:10,0 --> 00:00:20,0
 tremendous battle—Tens of thousands are slain—The wicked

3
00:00:20,0 --> 00:00:30,0
 are consigned to a state of endless woe; the

4
00:00:30,0 --> 00:00:40,0
 righteous attain a never-ending happiness. About

5
00:00:40,0 --> 00:00:50,0
 77–76 B.C.

6
00:00:50,751 --> 00:01:02,751
1 And now it came to pass that after the people of

7
00:01:02,751 --> 00:01:14,751
 Ammon were established in the land of Jershon,

8
00:01:14,751 --> 00:01:26,751
 and a church also established in the land of

9
00:01:26,751 --> 00:01:38,751
 Jershon, and the armies of the Nephites were set round

10
00:01:38,751 --> 00:01:50,751
 about the land of Jershon, yea, in all the borders

11
00:01:50,751 --> 00:02:02,751
 round about the land of Zarahemla; behold the

12
00:02:02,751 --> 00:02:14,751
 armies of the Lamanites had followed their brethren

13
00:02:14,751 --> 00:02:26,751
 into the wilderness

14
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,046
2 And thus there was a tremendous battle; yea,

15
00:02:28,046 --> 00:02:29,646
 even such an one as never had been known among all

16
00:02:29,646 --> 00:02:31,246
 the people in the land from the time Lehi left

17
00:02:31,246 --> 00:02:32,846
 Jerusalem; yea, and tens of thousands of the Lamanites

18
00:02:32,846 --> 00:02:34,446
 were slain and scattered abroad

19
00:02:34,188 --> 00:03:13,938
3 Yea, and also there was a tremendous slaughter

20
00:03:13,938 --> 00:03:53,688
 among the people of Nephi; nevertheless, the

21
00:03:53,688 --> 00:04:33,438
 Lamanites were driven and scattered, and the people of

22
00:04:33,438 --> 00:05:13,188
 Nephi returned again to their land

23
00:05:13,68 --> 00:05:19,013
4 And now this was a time that there was a great

24
00:05:19,013 --> 00:05:24,346
 mourning and lamentation heard throughout all the

25
00:05:24,346 --> 00:05:29,679
 land, among all the people of Nephi

26
00:05:29,63 --> 00:05:30,963
5 Yea, the cry of widows mourning for their

27
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,296
 husbands, and also of fathers mourning for their sons,

28
00:05:32,296 --> 00:05:33,629
 and the daughter for the brother, yea, the brother

29
00:05:33,629 --> 00:05:34,962
 for the father; and thus the cry of mourning was

30
00:05:34,962 --> 00:05:36,295
 heard among all of them, mourning for their kindred

31
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:37,628
 who had been slain

32
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:56,271
6 And now surely this was a sorrowful day; yea, a

33
00:05:56,271 --> 00:06:14,938
 time of solemnity, and a time of much fasting and

34
00:06:14,938 --> 00:06:33,605
 prayer

35
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:45,427
7 And thus endeth the fifteenth year of the reign

36
00:06:45,427 --> 00:06:57,427
 of the judges over the people of Nephi

37
00:06:57,351 --> 00:06:58,494
8 And this is the account of Ammon and his

38
00:06:58,494 --> 00:06:59,637
 brethren, their journeyings in the land of Nephi, their

39
00:06:59,637 --> 00:07:00,78
 sufferings in the land, their sorrows, and their

40
00:07:00,78 --> 00:07:01,923
 afflictions, and their incomprehensible joy, and the

41
00:07:01,923 --> 00:07:03,066
 reception and safety of the brethren in the land

42
00:07:03,066 --> 00:07:04,209
 of Jershon. And now may the Lord, the Redeemer of

43
00:07:04,209 --> 00:07:05,352
 all men, bless their souls forever

44
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:09,325
9 And this is the account of the wars and

45
00:07:09,325 --> 00:07:13,325
 contentions among the Nephites, and also the wars between

46
00:07:13,325 --> 00:07:17,325
 the Nephites and the Lamanites; and the fifteenth

47
00:07:17,325 --> 00:07:21,325
 year of the reign of the judges is ended

48
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:59,822
12 While many thousands of others truly mourn for

49
00:00:59,822 --> 00:01:03,822
 the loss of their kindred, yet they rejoice and

50
00:01:03,822 --> 00:01:07,822
 exult in the hope, and even know, according to the

51
00:01:07,822 --> 00:01:11,822
 promises of the Lord, that they are raised to dwell

52
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:15,822
 at the right hand of God, in a state of

53
00:01:15,822 --> 00:01:19,822
 never-ending happiness

54
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:56,546
13 And thus we see how great the inequality of man

55
00:01:56,546 --> 00:02:33,346
 is because of sin and transgression, and the

56
00:02:33,346 --> 00:03:10,146
 power of the devil, which comes by the cunning plans

57
00:03:10,146 --> 00:03:46,946
 which he hath devised to ensnare the hearts of men

58
00:03:46,946 --> 00:04:23,746


59
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:23,163
14 And thus we see the great call of diligence of

60
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:23,163
 men to labor in the vineyards of the Lord; and

61
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:23,163
 thus we see the great reason of sorrow, and also of

62
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:23,163
 rejoicing—sorrow because of death and destruction

63
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:23,163
 among men, and joy because of the light of Christ

64
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:23,163
 unto life.
