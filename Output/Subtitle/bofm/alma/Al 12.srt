00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:10,111
Chapter 12 Alma speaks to Zeezrom—The mysteries of

2
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:20,222
 God can be given only to the faithful—Men are

3
00:00:20,222 --> 00:00:30,333
 judged by their thoughts, beliefs, words, and

4
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:40,444
 works—The wicked will suffer a spiritual death—This

5
00:00:40,444 --> 00:00:50,555
 mortal life is a probationary state—The plan of

6
00:00:50,555 --> 00:01:00,666
 redemption brings to pass the Resurrection and, through

7
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:10,777
 faith, a remission of sins—The repentant have a

8
00:01:10,777 --> 00:01:20,888
 claim on mercy through the Only Begotten Son. About

9
00:01:20,888 --> 00:01:30,999
 82 B.C.

10
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:37,781
1 Now Alma, seeing that the words of Amulek had

11
00:01:37,781 --> 00:01:43,67
 silenced Zeezrom, for he beheld that Amulek had

12
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:49,559
 caught him in his lying and deceiving to destroy him,

13
00:01:49,559 --> 00:01:55,448
 and seeing that he began to tremble under a

14
00:01:55,448 --> 00:02:01,337
 consciousness of his guilt, he opened his mouth and

15
00:02:01,337 --> 00:02:07,226
 began to speak unto him, and to establish the words of

16
00:02:07,226 --> 00:02:13,115
 Amulek, and to explain things beyond, or to

17
00:02:13,115 --> 00:02:19,004
 unfold the scriptures beyond that which Amulek had

18
00:02:19,004 --> 00:02:24,893
 done

19
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:30,444
2 Now the words that Alma spake unto Zeezrom were

20
00:02:30,444 --> 00:02:36,444
 heard by the people round about; for the multitude

21
00:02:36,444 --> 00:02:42,444
 was great, and he spake on this wise

22
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:47,662
3 Now Zeezrom, seeing that thou hast been taken in

23
00:02:47,662 --> 00:02:52,995
 thy lying and craftiness, for thou hast not lied

24
00:02:52,995 --> 00:02:58,328
 unto men only but thou hast lied unto God; for

25
00:02:58,328 --> 00:03:03,661
 behold, he knows all thy thoughts, and thou seest

26
00:03:03,661 --> 00:03:08,994
 that thy thoughts are made known unto us by his

27
00:03:08,994 --> 00:03:14,327
 Spirit

28
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:20,494
4 And thou seest that we know that thy plan was a

29
00:03:20,494 --> 00:03:26,694
 very subtle plan, as to the subtlety of the devil,

30
00:03:26,694 --> 00:03:32,894
 for to lie and to deceive this people that thou

31
00:03:32,894 --> 00:03:39,094
 mightest set them against us, to revile us and to

32
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:45,294
 cast us out

33
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:51,459
5 Now this was a plan of thine adversary, and he

34
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:57,459
 hath exercised his power in thee. Now I would that

35
00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:03,459
 ye should remember that what I say unto thee I say

36
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:09,459
 unto all

37
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:15,526
6 And behold I say unto you all that this was a

38
00:04:15,526 --> 00:04:21,669
 snare of the adversary, which he has laid to catch

39
00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:27,812
 this people, that he might bring you into

40
00:04:27,812 --> 00:04:33,955
 subjection unto him, that he might encircle you about with

41
00:04:33,955 --> 00:04:40,098
 his chains, that he might chain you down to

42
00:04:40,098 --> 00:04:46,241
 everlasting destruction, according to the power of his

43
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:52,384
 captivity

44
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:59,309
7 Now when Alma had spoken these words, Zeezrom

45
00:04:59,309 --> 00:05:06,059
 began to tremble more exceedingly, for he was

46
00:05:06,059 --> 00:05:12,809
 convinced more and more of the power of God; and he was

47
00:05:12,809 --> 00:05:19,559
 also convinced that Alma and Amulek had a

48
00:05:19,559 --> 00:05:26,309
 knowledge of him, for he was convinced that they knew the

49
00:05:26,309 --> 00:05:33,059
 thoughts and intents of his heart; for power was

50
00:05:33,059 --> 00:05:39,809
 given unto them that they might know of these

51
00:05:39,809 --> 00:05:46,559
 things according to the spirit of prophecy

52
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:52,497
8 And Zeezrom began to inquire of them diligently,

53
00:05:52,497 --> 00:05:58,247
 that he might know more concerning the kingdom of

54
00:05:58,247 --> 00:06:03,997
 God. And he said unto Alma: What does this mean

55
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:09,747
 which Amulek hath spoken concerning the

56
00:06:09,747 --> 00:06:15,497
 resurrection of the dead, that all shall rise from the dead,

57
00:06:15,497 --> 00:06:21,247
 both the just and the unjust, and are brought to

58
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:26,997
 stand before God to be judged according to their

59
00:06:26,997 --> 00:06:32,747
 works

60
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:37,873
9 And now Alma began to expound these things unto

61
00:06:37,873 --> 00:06:43,587
 him, saying: It is given unto many to know the

62
00:06:43,587 --> 00:06:49,301
 mysteries of God; nevertheless they are laid under a

63
00:06:49,301 --> 00:06:55,015
 strict command that they shall not impart only

64
00:06:55,015 --> 00:07:00,729
 according to the portion of his word which he doth

65
00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:06,443
 grant unto the children of men, according to the

66
00:07:06,443 --> 00:07:12,157
 heed and diligence which they give unto him

67
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:18,532
10 And therefore, he that will harden his heart,

68
00:07:18,532 --> 00:07:25,032
 the same receiveth the lesser portion of the word;

69
00:07:25,032 --> 00:07:31,532
 and he that will not harden his heart, to him is

70
00:07:31,532 --> 00:07:38,032
 given the greater portion of the word, until it is

71
00:07:38,032 --> 00:07:44,532
 given unto him to know the mysteries of God until

72
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:51,032
 he know them in full

73
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:58,272
11 And they that will harden their hearts, to them

74
00:07:58,272 --> 00:08:04,605
 is given the lesser portion of the word until

75
00:08:04,605 --> 00:08:10,938
 they know nothing concerning his mysteries; and then

76
00:08:10,938 --> 00:08:17,271
 they are taken captive by the devil, and led by

77
00:08:17,271 --> 00:08:23,604
 his will down to destruction. Now this is what is

78
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:29,937
 meant by the chains of hell

79
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:37,176
12 And Amulek hath spoken plainly concerning

80
00:08:37,176 --> 00:08:44,676
 death, and being raised from this mortality to a state

81
00:08:44,676 --> 00:08:52,176
 of immortality, and being brought before the bar

82
00:08:52,176 --> 00:08:59,676
 of God, to be judged according to our works

83
00:08:59,94 --> 00:09:05,74
13 Then if our hearts have been hardened, yea, if

84
00:09:05,74 --> 00:09:11,54
 we have hardened our hearts against the word,

85
00:09:11,54 --> 00:09:17,34
 insomuch that it has not been found in us, then will

86
00:09:17,34 --> 00:09:23,14
 our state be awful, for then we shall be condemned

87
00:09:23,14 --> 00:09:28,94


88
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:35,578
14 For our words will condemn us, yea, all our

89
00:09:35,578 --> 00:09:42,721
 works will condemn us; we shall not be found

90
00:09:42,721 --> 00:09:49,864
 spotless; and our thoughts will also condemn us; and in

91
00:09:49,864 --> 00:09:57,007
 this awful state we shall not dare to look up to our

92
00:09:57,007 --> 00:10:04,15
 God; and we would fain be glad if we could

93
00:10:04,15 --> 00:10:11,293
 command the rocks and the mountains to fall upon us to

94
00:10:11,293 --> 00:10:18,436
 hide us from his presence

95
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:24,418
15 But this cannot be; we must come forth and

96
00:10:24,418 --> 00:10:30,751
 stand before him in his glory, and in his power, and

97
00:10:30,751 --> 00:10:37,084
 in his might, majesty, and dominion, and

98
00:10:37,084 --> 00:10:43,417
 acknowledge to our everlasting shame that all his judgments

99
00:10:43,417 --> 00:10:49,75
 are just; that he is just in all his works, and

100
00:10:49,75 --> 00:10:56,083
 that he is merciful unto the children of men, and

101
00:10:56,083 --> 00:11:02,416
 that he has all power to save every man that

102
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:08,749
 believeth on his name and bringeth forth fruit meet for

103
00:11:08,749 --> 00:11:15,082
 repentance

104
00:11:15,943 --> 00:11:22,61
16 And now behold, I say unto you then cometh a

105
00:11:22,61 --> 00:11:29,277
 death, even a second death, which is a spiritual

106
00:11:29,277 --> 00:11:35,944
 death; then is a time that whosoever dieth in his

107
00:11:35,944 --> 00:11:42,611
 sins, as to a temporal death, shall also die a

108
00:11:42,611 --> 00:11:49,278
 spiritual death; yea, he shall die as to things

109
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:55,945
 pertaining unto righteousness

110
00:11:55,616 --> 00:12:01,902
17 Then is the time when their torments shall be

111
00:12:01,902 --> 00:12:08,188
 as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame

112
00:12:08,188 --> 00:12:14,474
 ascendeth up forever and ever; and then is the time that

113
00:12:14,474 --> 00:12:20,76
 they shall be chained down to an everlasting

114
00:12:20,76 --> 00:12:27,046
 destruction, according to the power and captivity of

115
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:33,332
 Satan, he having subjected them according to his

116
00:12:33,332 --> 00:12:39,618
 will

117
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:47,326
18 Then, I say unto you, they shall be as though

118
00:12:47,326 --> 00:12:54,826
 there had been no redemption made; for they cannot

119
00:12:54,826 --> 00:13:02,326
 be redeemed according to God’s justice; and they

120
00:13:02,326 --> 00:13:09,826
 cannot die, seeing there is no more corruption

121
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:13,622
19 Now it came to pass that when Alma had made an

122
00:13:13,622 --> 00:13:17,955
 end of speaking these words, the people began to

123
00:13:17,955 --> 00:13:22,288
 be more astonished

124
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:29,035
20 But there was one Antionah, who was a chief

125
00:13:29,035 --> 00:13:36,035
 ruler among them, came forth and said unto him: What

126
00:13:36,035 --> 00:13:43,035
 is this that thou hast said, that man should rise

127
00:13:43,035 --> 00:13:50,035
 from the dead and be changed from this mortal to

128
00:13:50,035 --> 00:13:57,035
 an immortal state, that the soul can never die

129
00:13:57,037 --> 00:14:01,894
21 What does the scripture mean, which saith that

130
00:14:01,894 --> 00:14:06,751
 God placed cherubim and a flaming sword on the

131
00:14:06,751 --> 00:14:11,608
 east of the garden of Eden, lest our first parents

132
00:14:11,608 --> 00:14:16,465
 should enter and partake of the fruit of the tree of

133
00:14:16,465 --> 00:14:21,322
 life, and live forever? And thus we see that

134
00:14:21,322 --> 00:14:26,179
 there was no possible chance that they should live

135
00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:31,036
 forever

136
00:14:31,572 --> 00:14:37,072
22 Now Alma said unto him: This is the thing which

137
00:14:37,072 --> 00:14:42,572
 I was about to explain. Now we see that Adam did

138
00:14:42,572 --> 00:14:48,072
 fall by the partaking of the forbidden fruit,

139
00:14:48,072 --> 00:14:53,572
 according to the word of God; and thus we see, that by

140
00:14:53,572 --> 00:14:59,072
 his fall, all mankind became a lost and fallen

141
00:14:59,072 --> 00:15:04,572
 people

142
00:15:04,538 --> 00:15:10,705
23 And now behold, I say unto you that if it had

143
00:15:10,705 --> 00:15:16,872
 been possible for Adam to have partaken of the

144
00:15:16,872 --> 00:15:23,039
 fruit of the tree of life at that time, there would

145
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:29,206
 have been no death, and the word would have been

146
00:15:29,206 --> 00:15:35,373
 void, making God a liar, for he said: If thou eat

147
00:15:35,373 --> 00:15:41,54
 thou shalt surely die

148
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:48,15
24 And we see that death comes upon mankind, yea,

149
00:15:48,15 --> 00:15:55,025
 the death which has been spoken of by Amulek,

150
00:15:55,025 --> 00:16:01,9
 which is the temporal death; nevertheless there was a

151
00:16:01,9 --> 00:16:08,775
 space granted unto man in which he might repent;

152
00:16:08,775 --> 00:16:15,65
 therefore this life became a probationary state; a

153
00:16:15,65 --> 00:16:22,525
 time to prepare to meet God; a time to prepare for

154
00:16:22,525 --> 00:16:29,4
 that endless state which has been spoken of by

155
00:16:29,4 --> 00:16:36,275
 us, which is after the resurrection of the dead

156
00:16:36,63 --> 00:16:41,797
25 Now, if it had not been for the plan of

157
00:16:41,797 --> 00:16:46,964
 redemption, which was laid from the foundation of the

158
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:52,131
 world, there could have been no resurrection of the

159
00:16:52,131 --> 00:16:57,298
 dead; but there was a plan of redemption laid,

160
00:16:57,298 --> 00:17:02,465
 which shall bring to pass the resurrection of the

161
00:17:02,465 --> 00:17:07,632
 dead, of which has been spoken

162
00:17:07,094 --> 00:17:12,523
26 And now behold, if it were possible that our

163
00:17:12,523 --> 00:17:17,952
 first parents could have gone forth and partaken of

164
00:17:17,952 --> 00:17:23,381
 the tree of life they would have been forever

165
00:17:23,381 --> 00:17:28,81
 miserable, having no preparatory state; and thus the

166
00:17:28,81 --> 00:17:34,239
 plan of redemption would have been frustrated, and

167
00:17:34,239 --> 00:17:39,668
 the word of God would have been void, taking none

168
00:17:39,668 --> 00:17:45,097
 effect

169
00:17:45,766 --> 00:17:52,266
27 But behold, it was not so; but it was appointed

170
00:17:52,266 --> 00:17:58,766
 unto men that they must die; and after death,

171
00:17:58,766 --> 00:18:05,266
 they must come to judgment, even that same judgment

172
00:18:05,266 --> 00:18:11,766
 of which we have spoken, which is the end

173
00:18:11,792 --> 00:18:17,292
28 And after God had appointed that these things

174
00:18:17,292 --> 00:18:22,792
 should come unto man, behold, then he saw that it

175
00:18:22,792 --> 00:18:28,292
 was expedient that man should know concerning the

176
00:18:28,292 --> 00:18:33,792
 things whereof he had appointed unto them

177
00:18:33,28 --> 00:18:40,28
29 Therefore he sent angels to converse with them,

178
00:18:40,28 --> 00:18:47,28
 who caused men to behold of his glory

179
00:18:47,027 --> 00:18:52,694
30 And they began from that time forth to call on

180
00:18:52,694 --> 00:18:58,361
 his name; therefore God conversed with men, and

181
00:18:58,361 --> 00:19:04,028
 made known unto them the plan of redemption, which

182
00:19:04,028 --> 00:19:09,695
 had been prepared from the foundation of the world;

183
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:15,362
 and this he made known unto them according to

184
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:21,029
 their faith and repentance and their holy works

185
00:19:21,028 --> 00:19:27,171
31 Wherefore, he gave commandments unto men, they

186
00:19:27,171 --> 00:19:33,314
 having first transgressed the first commandments

187
00:19:33,314 --> 00:19:39,457
 as to things which were temporal, and becoming as

188
00:19:39,457 --> 00:19:45,6
 gods, knowing good from evil, placing themselves in

189
00:19:45,6 --> 00:19:51,743
 a state to act, or being placed in a state to act

190
00:19:51,743 --> 00:19:57,886
 according to their wills and pleasures, whether

191
00:19:57,886 --> 00:20:04,029
 to do evil or to do good

192
00:20:04,238 --> 00:20:10,488
32 Therefore God gave unto them commandments,

193
00:20:10,488 --> 00:20:16,738
 after having made known unto them the plan of

194
00:20:16,738 --> 00:20:22,988
 redemption, that they should not do evil, the penalty

195
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:29,238
 thereof being a second death, which was an everlasting

196
00:20:29,238 --> 00:20:35,488
 death as to things pertaining unto righteousness;

197
00:20:35,488 --> 00:20:41,738
 for on such the plan of redemption could have no

198
00:20:41,738 --> 00:20:47,988
 power, for the works of justice could not be

199
00:20:47,988 --> 00:20:54,238
 destroyed, according to the supreme goodness of God

200
00:20:54,121 --> 00:21:00,921
33 But God did call on men, in the name of his

201
00:21:00,921 --> 00:21:07,721
 Son, (this being the plan of redemption which was

202
00:21:07,721 --> 00:21:14,521
 laid) saying: If ye will repent, and harden not your

203
00:21:14,521 --> 00:21:21,321
 hearts, then will I have mercy upon you, through

204
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:28,121
 mine Only Begotten Son

205
00:21:28,088 --> 00:21:34,838
34 Therefore, whosoever repenteth, and hardeneth

206
00:21:34,838 --> 00:21:41,588
 not his heart, he shall have claim on mercy through

207
00:21:41,588 --> 00:21:48,338
 mine Only Begotten Son, unto a remission of his

208
00:21:48,338 --> 00:21:55,088
 sins; and these shall enter into my rest

209
00:21:55,048 --> 00:22:00,715
35 And whosoever will harden his heart and will do

210
00:22:00,715 --> 00:22:06,382
 iniquity, behold, I swear in my wrath that he

211
00:22:06,382 --> 00:22:12,049
 shall not enter into my rest

212
00:22:12,566 --> 00:22:19,233
36 And now, my brethren, behold I say unto you,

213
00:22:19,233 --> 00:22:25,9
 that if ye will harden your hearts ye shall not

214
00:22:25,9 --> 00:22:32,567
 enter into the rest of the Lord; therefore your

215
00:22:32,567 --> 00:22:39,234
 iniquity provoketh him that he sendeth down his wrath

216
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:45,901
 upon you as in the first provocation, yea, according

217
00:22:45,901 --> 00:22:52,568
 to his word in the last provocation as well as

218
00:22:52,568 --> 00:22:59,235
 the first, to the everlasting destruction of your

219
00:22:59,235 --> 00:23:05,902
 souls; therefore, according to his word, unto the

220
00:23:05,902 --> 00:23:12,569
 last death, as well as the first

221
00:23:12,192 --> 00:23:18,621
37 And now, my brethren, seeing we know these

222
00:23:18,621 --> 00:23:25,05
 things, and they are true, let us repent, and harden

223
00:23:25,05 --> 00:23:31,479
 not our hearts, that we provoke not the Lord our

224
00:23:31,479 --> 00:23:37,908
 God to pull down his wrath upon us in these his

225
00:23:37,908 --> 00:23:44,337
 second commandments which he has given unto us; but

226
00:23:44,337 --> 00:23:50,766
 let us enter into the rest of God, which is prepared

227
00:23:50,766 --> 00:23:57,195
 according to his word.
