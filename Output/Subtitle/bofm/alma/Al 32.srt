00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:19,286
Chapter 32 Alma teaches the poor whose afflictions

2
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:38,572
 had humbled them—Faith is a hope in that which is

3
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:57,858
 not seen which is true—Alma testifies that angels

4
00:00:57,858 --> 00:01:17,144
 minister to men, women, and children—Alma

5
00:01:17,144 --> 00:01:36,43
 compares the word unto a seed—It must be planted and

6
00:01:36,43 --> 00:01:55,716
 nourished—Then it grows into a tree from which the

7
00:01:55,716 --> 00:02:15,002
 fruit of eternal life is picked. About 74 B.C.

8
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:26,769
1 And it came to pass that they did go forth, and

9
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:37,969
 began to preach the word of God unto the people,

10
00:02:37,969 --> 00:02:49,169
 entering into their synagogues, and into their

11
00:02:49,169 --> 00:03:00,369
 houses; yea, and even they did preach the word in

12
00:03:00,369 --> 00:03:11,569
 their streets

13
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:36,791
2 And it came to pass that after much labor among

14
00:03:36,791 --> 00:04:02,191
 them, they began to have success among the poor

15
00:04:02,191 --> 00:04:27,591
 class of people; for behold, they were cast out of

16
00:04:27,591 --> 00:04:52,991
 the synagogues because of the coarseness of their

17
00:04:52,991 --> 00:05:18,391
 apparel

18
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:25,652
3 Therefore they were not permitted to enter into

19
00:05:25,652 --> 00:05:32,319
 their synagogues to worship God, being esteemed as

20
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:38,986
 filthiness; therefore they were poor; yea, they

21
00:05:38,986 --> 00:05:45,653
 were esteemed by their brethren as dross; therefore

22
00:05:45,653 --> 00:05:52,32
 they were poor as to things of the world; and

23
00:05:52,32 --> 00:05:58,987
 also they were poor in heart

24
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,459
4 Now, as Alma was teaching and speaking unto the

25
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:02,058
 people upon the hill Onidah, there came a great

26
00:06:02,058 --> 00:06:03,659
 multitude unto him, who were those of whom we have

27
00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:05,258
 been speaking, of whom were poor in heart, because

28
00:06:05,258 --> 00:06:06,858
 of their poverty as to the things of the world

29
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:07,633
5 And they came unto Alma; and the one who was the

30
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:08,433
 foremost among them said unto him: Behold, what

31
00:06:08,433 --> 00:06:09,233
 shall these my brethren do, for they are despised

32
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:10,033
 of all men because of their poverty, yea, and more

33
00:06:10,033 --> 00:06:10,833
 especially by our priests; for they have cast us

34
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:11,633
 out of our synagogues which we have labored

35
00:06:11,633 --> 00:06:12,433
 abundantly to build with our own hands; and they have

36
00:06:12,433 --> 00:06:13,233
 cast us out because of our exceeding poverty; and we

37
00:06:13,233 --> 00:06:14,033
 have no place to worship our God; and behold, what

38
00:06:14,033 --> 00:06:14,833
 shall we do

39
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:18,008
6 And now when Alma heard this, he turned him

40
00:06:18,008 --> 00:06:21,208
 about, his face immediately towards him, and he beheld

41
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:24,408
 with great joy; for he beheld that their

42
00:06:24,408 --> 00:06:27,608
 afflictions had truly humbled them, and that they were in

43
00:06:27,608 --> 00:06:30,808
 a preparation to hear the word

44
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:36,757
7 Therefore he did say no more to the other

45
00:06:36,757 --> 00:06:42,757
 multitude; but he stretched forth his hand, and cried

46
00:06:42,757 --> 00:06:48,757
 unto those whom he beheld, who were truly penitent,

47
00:06:48,757 --> 00:06:54,757
 and said unto them

48
00:06:54,681 --> 00:07:14,681
8 I behold that ye are lowly in heart; and if so,

49
00:07:14,681 --> 00:07:34,681
 blessed are ye

50
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:37,221
9 Behold thy brother hath said, What shall we

51
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:39,888
 do?—for we are cast out of our synagogues, that we

52
00:07:39,888 --> 00:07:42,555
 cannot worship our God

53
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:55,862
10 Behold I say unto you, do ye suppose that ye

54
00:07:55,862 --> 00:08:09,195
 cannot worship God save it be in your synagogues

55
00:08:09,195 --> 00:08:22,528
 only

56
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:54,402
11 And moreover, I would ask, do ye suppose that

57
00:08:54,402 --> 00:09:26,402
 ye must not worship God only once in a week

58
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:27,199
12 I say unto you, it is well that ye are cast out

59
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:28,199
 of your synagogues, that ye may be humble, and

60
00:09:28,199 --> 00:09:29,199
 that ye may learn wisdom; for it is necessary that

61
00:09:29,199 --> 00:09:30,199
 ye should learn wisdom; for it is because that ye

62
00:09:30,199 --> 00:09:31,199
 are cast out, that ye are despised of your brethren

63
00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:32,199
 because of your exceeding poverty, that ye are

64
00:09:32,199 --> 00:09:33,199
 brought to a lowliness of heart; for ye are

65
00:09:33,199 --> 00:09:34,199
 necessarily brought to be humble

66
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:35,507
13 And now, because ye are compelled to be humble

67
00:09:35,507 --> 00:09:36,84
 blessed are ye; for a man sometimes, if he is

68
00:09:36,84 --> 00:09:38,173
 compelled to be humble, seeketh repentance; and now

69
00:09:38,173 --> 00:09:39,506
 surely, whosoever repenteth shall find mercy; and he

70
00:09:39,506 --> 00:09:40,839
 that findeth mercy and endureth to the end the

71
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:42,172
 same shall be saved

72
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,148
14 And now, as I said unto you, that because ye

73
00:09:44,148 --> 00:09:46,148
 were compelled to be humble ye were blessed, do ye

74
00:09:46,148 --> 00:09:48,148
 not suppose that they are more blessed who truly

75
00:09:48,148 --> 00:09:50,148
 humble themselves because of the word

76
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:54,923
15 Yea, he that truly humbleth himself, and

77
00:09:54,923 --> 00:09:59,723
 repenteth of his sins, and endureth to the end, the same

78
00:09:59,723 --> 00:10:04,523
 shall be blessed—yea, much more blessed than they

79
00:10:04,523 --> 00:10:09,323
 who are compelled to be humble because of their

80
00:10:09,323 --> 00:10:14,123
 exceeding poverty

81
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:20,761
16 Therefore, blessed are they who humble

82
00:10:20,761 --> 00:10:27,475
 themselves without being compelled to be humble; or

83
00:10:27,475 --> 00:10:34,189
 rather, in other words, blessed is he that believeth in

84
00:10:34,189 --> 00:10:40,903
 the word of God, and is baptized without

85
00:10:40,903 --> 00:10:47,617
 stubbornness of heart, yea, without being brought to know

86
00:10:47,617 --> 00:10:54,331
 the word, or even compelled to know, before they

87
00:10:54,331 --> 00:11:01,045
 will believe

88
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:52,562
17 Yea, there are many who do say: If thou wilt

89
00:11:52,562 --> 00:12:43,229
 show unto us a sign from heaven, then we shall know

90
00:12:43,229 --> 00:13:33,896
 of a surety; then we shall believe

91
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:38,746
18 Now I ask, is this faith? Behold, I say unto

92
00:13:38,746 --> 00:13:44,079
 you, Nay; for if a man knoweth a thing he hath no

93
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:49,412
 cause to believe, for he knoweth it

94
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:59,362
19 And now, how much more cursed is he that

95
00:13:59,362 --> 00:14:09,362
 knoweth the will of God and doeth it not, than he that

96
00:14:09,362 --> 00:14:19,362
 only believeth, or only hath cause to believe, and

97
00:14:19,362 --> 00:14:29,362
 falleth into transgression

98
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:56,985
20 Now of this thing ye must judge. Behold, I say

99
00:14:56,985 --> 00:15:24,735
 unto you, that it is on the one hand even as it is

100
00:15:24,735 --> 00:15:52,485
 on the other; and it shall be unto every man

101
00:15:52,485 --> 00:16:20,235
 according to his work

102
00:16:20,88 --> 00:16:40,88
21 And now as I said concerning faith—faith is not

103
00:16:40,88 --> 00:17:00,88
 to have a perfect knowledge of things; therefore

104
00:17:00,88 --> 00:17:20,88
 if ye have faith ye hope for things which are not

105
00:17:20,88 --> 00:17:40,88
 seen, which are true

106
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:48,626
22 And now, behold, I say unto you, and I would

107
00:17:48,626 --> 00:17:56,626
 that ye should remember, that God is merciful unto

108
00:17:56,626 --> 00:18:04,626
 all who believe on his name; therefore he desireth,

109
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:12,626
 in the first place, that ye should believe, yea,

110
00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:20,626
 even on his word

111
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:31,699
23 And now, he imparteth his word by angels unto

112
00:18:31,699 --> 00:18:42,899
 men, yea, not only men but women also. Now this is

113
00:18:42,899 --> 00:18:54,099
 not all; little children do have words given unto

114
00:18:54,099 --> 00:19:05,299
 them many times, which confound the wise and the

115
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:16,499
 learned

116
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:21,122
24 And now, my beloved brethren, as ye have

117
00:19:21,122 --> 00:19:25,922
 desired to know of me what ye shall do because ye are

118
00:19:25,922 --> 00:19:30,722
 afflicted and cast out—now I do not desire that ye

119
00:19:30,722 --> 00:19:35,522
 should suppose that I mean to judge you only

120
00:19:35,522 --> 00:19:40,322
 according to that which is true

121
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:41,846
25 For I do not mean that ye all of you have been

122
00:19:41,846 --> 00:19:43,446
 compelled to humble yourselves; for I verily

123
00:19:43,446 --> 00:19:45,046
 believe that there are some among you who would humble

124
00:19:45,046 --> 00:19:46,646
 themselves, let them be in whatsoever

125
00:19:46,646 --> 00:19:48,246
 circumstances they might

126
00:19:48,22 --> 00:19:49,82
26 Now, as I said concerning faith—that it was not

127
00:19:49,82 --> 00:19:51,42
 a perfect knowledge—even so it is with my words.

128
00:19:51,42 --> 00:19:53,02
 Ye cannot know of their surety at first, unto

129
00:19:53,02 --> 00:19:54,62
 perfection, any more than faith is a perfect

130
00:19:54,62 --> 00:19:56,22
 knowledge

131
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,862
27 But behold, if ye will awake and arouse your

132
00:19:58,862 --> 00:20:01,529
 faculties, even to an experiment upon my words, and

133
00:20:01,529 --> 00:20:04,196
 exercise a particle of faith, yea, even if ye can

134
00:20:04,196 --> 00:20:06,863
 no more than desire to believe, let this desire

135
00:20:06,863 --> 00:20:09,53
 work in you, even until ye believe in a manner that

136
00:20:09,53 --> 00:20:12,197
 ye can give place for a portion of my words

137
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:13,477
28 Now, we will compare the word unto a seed. Now,

138
00:20:13,477 --> 00:20:14,81
 if ye give place, that a seed may be planted in

139
00:20:14,81 --> 00:20:16,143
 your heart, behold, if it be a true seed, or a good

140
00:20:16,143 --> 00:20:17,476
 seed, if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief,

141
00:20:17,476 --> 00:20:18,809
 that ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord,

142
00:20:18,809 --> 00:20:20,142
 behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts; and

143
00:20:20,142 --> 00:20:21,475
 when you feel these swelling motions, ye will

144
00:20:21,475 --> 00:20:22,808
 begin to say within yourselves—It must needs be that

145
00:20:22,808 --> 00:20:24,141
 this is a good seed, or that the word is good, for

146
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:25,474
 it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth

147
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,807
 to enlighten my understanding, yea, it beginneth

148
00:20:26,807 --> 00:20:28,14
 to be delicious to me

149
00:20:28,094 --> 00:21:18,427
29 Now behold, would not this increase your faith?

150
00:21:18,427 --> 00:22:08,76
 I say unto you, Yea; nevertheless it hath not

151
00:22:08,76 --> 00:22:59,093
 grown up to a perfect knowledge

152
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:18,612
30 But behold, as the seed swelleth, and

153
00:23:18,612 --> 00:23:37,612
 sprouteth, and beginneth to grow, then you must needs say

154
00:23:37,612 --> 00:23:56,612
 that the seed is good; for behold it swelleth, and

155
00:23:56,612 --> 00:24:15,612
 sprouteth, and beginneth to grow. And now, behold,

156
00:24:15,612 --> 00:24:34,612
 will not this strengthen your faith? Yea, it will

157
00:24:34,612 --> 00:24:53,612
 strengthen your faith: for ye will say I know

158
00:24:53,612 --> 00:25:12,612
 that this is a good seed; for behold it sprouteth and

159
00:25:12,612 --> 00:25:31,612
 beginneth to grow

160
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:29,569
33 And now, behold, because ye have tried the

161
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:43,569
 experiment, and planted the seed, and it swelleth and

162
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:57,569
 sprouteth, and beginneth to grow, ye must needs

163
00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:11,569
 know that the seed is good

164
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:29,534
34 And now, behold, is your knowledge perfect?

165
00:03:29,534 --> 00:03:47,677
 Yea, your knowledge is perfect in that thing, and

166
00:03:47,677 --> 00:04:05,82
 your faith is dormant; and this because you know, for

167
00:04:05,82 --> 00:04:23,963
 ye know that the word hath swelled your souls,

168
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:42,106
 and ye also know that it hath sprouted up, that your

169
00:04:42,106 --> 00:05:00,249
 understanding doth begin to be enlightened, and

170
00:05:00,249 --> 00:05:18,392
 your mind doth begin to expand

171
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:26,985
35 O then, is not this real? I say unto you, Yea,

172
00:05:26,985 --> 00:05:34,985
 because it is light; and whatsoever is light, is

173
00:05:34,985 --> 00:05:42,985
 good, because it is discernible, therefore ye must

174
00:05:42,985 --> 00:05:50,985
 know that it is good; and now behold, after ye

175
00:05:50,985 --> 00:05:58,985
 have tasted this light is your knowledge perfect

176
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,858
36 Behold I say unto you, Nay; neither must ye lay

177
00:06:00,858 --> 00:06:02,858
 aside your faith, for ye have only exercised your

178
00:06:02,858 --> 00:06:04,858
 faith to plant the seed that ye might try the

179
00:06:04,858 --> 00:06:06,858
 experiment to know if the seed was good

180
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,166
37 And behold, as the tree beginneth to grow, ye

181
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,499
 will say: Let us nourish it with great care, that

182
00:06:09,499 --> 00:06:10,832
 it may get root, that it may grow up, and bring

183
00:06:10,832 --> 00:06:12,165
 forth fruit unto us. And now behold, if ye nourish it

184
00:06:12,165 --> 00:06:13,498
 with much care it will get root, and grow up, and

185
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:14,831
 bring forth fruit

186
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:18,008
38 But if ye neglect the tree, and take no thought

187
00:06:18,008 --> 00:06:21,208
 for its nourishment, behold it will not get any

188
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:24,408
 root; and when the heat of the sun cometh and

189
00:06:24,408 --> 00:06:27,608
 scorcheth it, because it hath no root it withers away,

190
00:06:27,608 --> 00:06:30,808
 and ye pluck it up and cast it out

191
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:35,557
39 Now, this is not because the seed was not good,

192
00:06:35,557 --> 00:06:40,357
 neither is it because the fruit thereof would not

193
00:06:40,357 --> 00:06:45,157
 be desirable; but it is because your ground is

194
00:06:45,157 --> 00:06:49,957
 barren, and ye will not nourish the tree, therefore

195
00:06:49,957 --> 00:06:54,757
 ye cannot have the fruit thereof

196
00:06:54,681 --> 00:07:04,681
40 And thus, if ye will not nourish the word,

197
00:07:04,681 --> 00:07:14,681
 looking forward with an eye of faith to the fruit

198
00:07:14,681 --> 00:07:24,681
 thereof, ye can never pluck of the fruit of the tree

199
00:07:24,681 --> 00:07:34,681
 of life

200
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:35,887
41 But if ye will nourish the word, yea, nourish

201
00:07:35,887 --> 00:07:37,22
 the tree as it beginneth to grow, by your faith

202
00:07:37,22 --> 00:07:38,553
 with great diligence, and with patience, looking

203
00:07:38,553 --> 00:07:39,886
 forward to the fruit thereof, it shall take root; and

204
00:07:39,886 --> 00:07:41,219
 behold it shall be a tree springing up unto

205
00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:42,552
 everlasting life

206
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:46,973
42 And because of your diligence and your faith

207
00:07:46,973 --> 00:07:51,417
 and your patience with the word in nourishing it,

208
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:55,861
 that it may take root in you, behold, by and by ye

209
00:07:55,861 --> 00:08:00,305
 shall pluck the fruit thereof, which is most

210
00:08:00,305 --> 00:08:04,749
 precious, which is sweet above all that is sweet, and

211
00:08:04,749 --> 00:08:09,193
 which is white above all that is white, yea, and

212
00:08:09,193 --> 00:08:13,637
 pure above all that is pure; and ye shall feast upon

213
00:08:13,637 --> 00:08:18,081
 this fruit even until ye are filled, that ye

214
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:22,525
 hunger not, neither shall ye thirst

215
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:22,402
43 Then, my brethren, ye shall reap the rewards of

216
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:22,402
 your faith, and your diligence, and patience, and

217
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:22,402
 long-suffering, waiting for the tree to bring

218
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:22,402
 forth fruit unto you.
