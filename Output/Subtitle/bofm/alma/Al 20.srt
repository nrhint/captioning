00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:11,0
Chapter 20 The Lord sends Ammon to Middoni to

2
00:00:11,0 --> 00:00:22,0
 deliver his imprisoned brethren—Ammon and Lamoni meet

3
00:00:22,0 --> 00:00:33,0
 Lamoni’s father, who is king over all the

4
00:00:33,0 --> 00:00:44,0
 land—Ammon compels the old king to approve the release of

5
00:00:44,0 --> 00:00:55,0
 his brethren. About 90 B.C.

6
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,822
1 And it came to pass that when they had

7
00:00:57,822 --> 00:00:59,822
 established a church in that land, that king Lamoni desired

8
00:00:59,822 --> 00:01:01,822
 that Ammon should go with him to the land of

9
00:01:01,822 --> 00:01:03,822
 Nephi, that he might show him unto his father

10
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:13,197
2 And the voice of the Lord came to Ammon, saying:

11
00:01:13,197 --> 00:01:22,597
 Thou shalt not go up to the land of Nephi, for

12
00:01:22,597 --> 00:01:31,997
 behold, the king will seek thy life; but thou shalt

13
00:01:31,997 --> 00:01:41,397
 go to the land of Middoni; for behold, thy brother

14
00:01:41,397 --> 00:01:50,797
 Aaron, and also Muloki and Ammah are in prison

15
00:01:50,41 --> 00:01:55,91
3 Now it came to pass that when Ammon had heard

16
00:01:55,91 --> 00:02:01,41
 this, he said unto Lamoni: Behold, my brother and

17
00:02:01,41 --> 00:02:06,91
 brethren are in prison at Middoni, and I go that I

18
00:02:06,91 --> 00:02:12,41
 may deliver them

19
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:19,155
4 Now Lamoni said unto Ammon: I know, in the

20
00:02:19,155 --> 00:02:25,377
 strength of the Lord thou canst do all things. But

21
00:02:25,377 --> 00:02:31,599
 behold, I will go with thee to the land of Middoni;

22
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:37,821
 for the king of the land of Middoni, whose name is

23
00:02:37,821 --> 00:02:44,043
 Antiomno, is a friend unto me; therefore I go to

24
00:02:44,043 --> 00:02:50,265
 the land of Middoni, that I may flatter the king of

25
00:02:50,265 --> 00:02:56,487
 the land, and he will cast thy brethren out of

26
00:02:56,487 --> 00:03:02,709
 prison. Now Lamoni said unto him: Who told thee that

27
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:08,931
 thy brethren were in prison

28
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:14,856
5 And Ammon said unto him: No one hath told me,

29
00:03:14,856 --> 00:03:20,856
 save it be God; and he said unto me—Go and deliver

30
00:03:20,856 --> 00:03:26,856
 thy brethren, for they are in prison in the land of

31
00:03:26,856 --> 00:03:32,856
 Middoni

32
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:37,512
6 Now when Lamoni had heard this he caused that

33
00:03:37,512 --> 00:03:42,845
 his servants should make ready his horses and his

34
00:03:42,845 --> 00:03:48,178
 chariots

35
00:03:48,262 --> 00:04:02,262
7 And he said unto Ammon: Come, I will go with

36
00:04:02,262 --> 00:04:16,262
 thee down to the land of Middoni, and there I will

37
00:04:16,262 --> 00:04:30,262
 plead with the king that he will cast thy brethren

38
00:04:30,262 --> 00:04:44,262
 out of prison

39
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:46,751
8 And it came to pass that as Ammon and Lamoni

40
00:04:46,751 --> 00:04:49,418
 were journeying thither, they met the father of

41
00:04:49,418 --> 00:04:52,085
 Lamoni, who was king over all the land

42
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:53,809
9 And behold, the father of Lamoni said unto him:

43
00:04:53,809 --> 00:04:55,559
 Why did ye not come to the feast on that great day

44
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:57,309
 when I made a feast unto my sons, and unto my

45
00:04:57,309 --> 00:04:59,059
 people

46
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:00,766
10 And he also said: Whither art thou going with

47
00:05:00,766 --> 00:05:02,433
 this Nephite, who is one of the children of a liar

48
00:05:02,433 --> 00:05:04,1


49
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:07,105
11 And it came to pass that Lamoni rehearsed unto

50
00:05:07,105 --> 00:05:09,772
 him whither he was going, for he feared to offend

51
00:05:09,772 --> 00:05:12,439
 him

52
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:19,745
12 And he also told him all the cause of his

53
00:05:19,745 --> 00:05:27,078
 tarrying in his own kingdom, that he did not go unto

54
00:05:27,078 --> 00:05:34,411
 his father to the feast which he had prepared

55
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:40,551
13 And now when Lamoni had rehearsed unto him all

56
00:05:40,551 --> 00:05:46,801
 these things, behold, to his astonishment, his

57
00:05:46,801 --> 00:05:53,051
 father was angry with him, and said: Lamoni, thou art

58
00:05:53,051 --> 00:05:59,301
 going to deliver these Nephites, who are sons of

59
00:05:59,301 --> 00:06:05,551
 a liar. Behold, he robbed our fathers; and now his

60
00:06:05,551 --> 00:06:11,801
 children are also come amongst us that they may,

61
00:06:11,801 --> 00:06:18,051
 by their cunning and their lyings, deceive us,

62
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:24,301
 that they again may rob us of our property

63
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:29,918
14 Now the father of Lamoni commanded him that he

64
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:35,318
 should slay Ammon with the sword. And he also

65
00:06:35,318 --> 00:06:40,718
 commanded him that he should not go to the land of

66
00:06:40,718 --> 00:06:46,118
 Middoni, but that he should return with him to the

67
00:06:46,118 --> 00:06:51,518
 land of Ishmael

68
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:57,778
15 But Lamoni said unto him: I will not slay

69
00:06:57,778 --> 00:07:04,178
 Ammon, neither will I return to the land of Ishmael,

70
00:07:04,178 --> 00:07:10,578
 but I go to the land of Middoni that I may release

71
00:07:10,578 --> 00:07:16,978
 the brethren of Ammon, for I know that they are

72
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:23,378
 just men and holy prophets of the true God

73
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:29,61
16 Now when his father had heard these words, he

74
00:07:29,61 --> 00:07:35,943
 was angry with him, and he drew his sword that he

75
00:07:35,943 --> 00:07:42,276
 might smite him to the earth

76
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:48,862
17 But Ammon stood forth and said unto him:

77
00:07:48,862 --> 00:07:55,195
 Behold, thou shalt not slay thy son; nevertheless, it

78
00:07:55,195 --> 00:08:01,528
 were better that he should fall than thee, for

79
00:08:01,528 --> 00:08:07,861
 behold, he has repented of his sins; but if thou

80
00:08:07,861 --> 00:08:14,194
 shouldst fall at this time, in thine anger, thy soul

81
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:20,527
 could not be saved

82
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:24,633
18 And again, it is expedient that thou shouldst

83
00:08:24,633 --> 00:08:29,233
 forbear; for if thou shouldst slay thy son, he

84
00:08:29,233 --> 00:08:33,833
 being an innocent man, his blood would cry from the

85
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:38,433
 ground to the Lord his God, for vengeance to come

86
00:08:38,433 --> 00:08:43,033
 upon thee; and perhaps thou wouldst lose thy soul

87
00:08:43,79 --> 00:08:47,79
19 Now when Ammon had said these words unto him,

88
00:08:47,79 --> 00:08:51,79
 he answered him, saying: I know that if I should

89
00:08:51,79 --> 00:08:55,79
 slay my son, that I should shed innocent blood; for

90
00:08:55,79 --> 00:08:59,79
 it is thou that hast sought to destroy him

91
00:08:59,74 --> 00:09:37,073
20 And he stretched forth his hand to slay Ammon.

92
00:09:37,073 --> 00:10:14,406
 But Ammon withstood his blows, and also smote his

93
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:51,739
 arm that he could not use it

94
00:10:51,385 --> 00:10:54,052
21 Now when the king saw that Ammon could slay

95
00:10:54,052 --> 00:10:56,719
 him, he began to plead with Ammon that he would spare

96
00:10:56,719 --> 00:10:59,386
 his life

97
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:05,359
22 But Ammon raised his sword, and said unto him:

98
00:11:05,359 --> 00:11:11,359
 Behold, I will smite thee except thou wilt grant

99
00:11:11,359 --> 00:11:17,359
 unto me that my brethren may be cast out of prison

100
00:11:17,359 --> 00:11:23,359


101
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:25,283
23 Now the king, fearing he should lose his life,

102
00:11:25,283 --> 00:11:27,283
 said: If thou wilt spare me I will grant unto thee

103
00:11:27,283 --> 00:11:29,283
 whatsoever thou wilt ask, even to half of the

104
00:11:29,283 --> 00:11:31,283
 kingdom

105
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:36,591
24 Now when Ammon saw that he had wrought upon the

106
00:11:36,591 --> 00:11:41,924
 old king according to his desire, he said unto

107
00:11:41,924 --> 00:11:47,257
 him: If thou wilt grant that my brethren may be cast

108
00:11:47,257 --> 00:11:52,59
 out of prison, and also that Lamoni may retain

109
00:11:52,59 --> 00:11:57,923
 his kingdom, and that ye be not displeased with him,

110
00:11:57,923 --> 00:12:03,256
 but grant that he may do according to his own

111
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:08,589
 desires in whatsoever thing he thinketh, then will I

112
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:13,922
 spare thee; otherwise I will smite thee to the

113
00:12:13,922 --> 00:12:19,255
 earth

114
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:35,106
25 Now when Ammon had said these words, the king

115
00:12:35,106 --> 00:12:51,106
 began to rejoice because of his life

116
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:55,337
26 And when he saw that Ammon had no desire to

117
00:12:55,337 --> 00:12:59,67
 destroy him, and when he also saw the great love he

118
00:12:59,67 --> 00:13:04,003
 had for his son Lamoni, he was astonished

119
00:13:04,003 --> 00:13:08,336
 exceedingly, and said: Because this is all that thou hast

120
00:13:08,336 --> 00:13:12,669
 desired, that I would release thy brethren, and

121
00:13:12,669 --> 00:13:17,002
 suffer that my son Lamoni should retain his kingdom,

122
00:13:17,002 --> 00:13:21,335
 behold, I will grant unto you that my son may

123
00:13:21,335 --> 00:13:25,668
 retain his kingdom from this time and forever; and I

124
00:13:25,668 --> 00:13:30,001
 will govern him no more

125
00:13:30,878 --> 00:13:39,878
27 And I will also grant unto thee that thy

126
00:13:39,878 --> 00:13:48,878
 brethren may be cast out of prison, and thou and thy

127
00:13:48,878 --> 00:13:57,878
 brethren may come unto me, in my kingdom; for I shall

128
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:06,878
 greatly desire to see thee. For the king was

129
00:14:06,878 --> 00:14:15,878
 greatly astonished at the words which he had spoken,

130
00:14:15,878 --> 00:14:24,878
 and also at the words which had been spoken by his

131
00:14:24,878 --> 00:14:33,878
 son Lamoni, therefore he was desirous to learn

132
00:14:33,878 --> 00:14:42,878
 them

133
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:47,449
28 And it came to pass that Ammon and Lamoni

134
00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:52,249
 proceeded on their journey towards the land of Middoni.

135
00:14:52,249 --> 00:14:57,049
 And Lamoni found favor in the eyes of the king of

136
00:14:57,049 --> 00:15:01,849
 the land; therefore the brethren of Ammon were

137
00:15:01,849 --> 00:15:06,649
 brought forth out of prison
