1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:10,4
Chapter 19 Lamoni receives the light of

2
00:00:10,4 --> 00:00:20,8
 everlasting life and sees the Redeemer—His household falls

3
00:00:20,8 --> 00:00:31,2
 into a trance, and many see angels—Ammon is

4
00:00:31,2 --> 00:00:41,6
 preserved miraculously—He baptizes many and establishes a

5
00:00:41,6 --> 00:00:52,0
 church among them. About 90 B.C.

6
00:00:52,452 --> 00:01:04,452
1 And it came to pass that after two days and two

7
00:01:04,452 --> 00:01:16,452
 nights they were about to take his body and lay it

8
00:01:16,452 --> 00:01:28,452
 in a sepulchre, which they had made for the

9
00:01:28,452 --> 00:01:40,452
 purpose of burying their dead

10
00:01:40,3 --> 00:01:48,3
2 Now the queen having heard of the fame of Ammon,

11
00:01:48,3 --> 00:01:56,3
 therefore she sent and desired that he should

12
00:01:56,3 --> 00:02:04,3
 come in unto her

13
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:30,557
3 And it came to pass that Ammon did as he was

14
00:02:30,557 --> 00:02:56,89
 commanded, and went in unto the queen, and desired to

15
00:02:56,89 --> 00:03:23,223
 know what she would that he should do

16
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:27,971
4 And she said unto him: The servants of my

17
00:03:27,971 --> 00:03:31,971
 husband have made it known unto me that thou art a

18
00:03:31,971 --> 00:03:35,971
 prophet of a holy God, and that thou hast power to do

19
00:03:35,971 --> 00:03:39,971
 many mighty works in his name

20
00:03:39,92 --> 00:03:41,634
5 Therefore, if this is the case, I would that ye

21
00:03:41,634 --> 00:03:43,348
 should go in and see my husband, for he has been

22
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,062
 laid upon his bed for the space of two days and two

23
00:03:45,062 --> 00:03:46,776
 nights; and some say that he is not dead, but

24
00:03:46,776 --> 00:03:48,49
 others say that he is dead and that he stinketh, and

25
00:03:48,49 --> 00:03:50,204
 that he ought to be placed in the sepulchre; but

26
00:03:50,204 --> 00:03:51,918
 as for myself, to me he doth not stink

27
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,005
6 Now, this was what Ammon desired, for he knew

28
00:03:53,005 --> 00:03:54,278
 that king Lamoni was under the power of God; he knew

29
00:03:54,278 --> 00:03:55,551
 that the dark veil of unbelief was being cast

30
00:03:55,551 --> 00:03:56,824
 away from his mind, and the light which did light up

31
00:03:56,824 --> 00:03:58,097
 his mind, which was the light of the glory of God,

32
00:03:58,097 --> 00:03:59,37
 which was a marvelous light of his goodness—yea,

33
00:03:59,37 --> 00:04:00,643
 this light had infused such joy into his soul, the

34
00:04:00,643 --> 00:04:01,916
 cloud of darkness having been dispelled, and that

35
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,189
 the light of everlasting life was lit up in his

36
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:04,462
 soul, yea, he knew that this had overcome his

37
00:04:04,462 --> 00:04:05,735
 natural frame, and he was carried away in God

38
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:22,828
7 Therefore, what the queen desired of him was his

39
00:04:22,828 --> 00:04:40,578
 only desire. Therefore, he went in to see the

40
00:04:40,578 --> 00:04:58,328
 king according as the queen had desired him; and he

41
00:04:58,328 --> 00:05:16,078
 saw the king, and he knew that he was not dead

42
00:05:16,85 --> 00:05:17,85
8 And he said unto the queen: He is not dead, but

43
00:05:17,85 --> 00:05:18,85
 he sleepeth in God, and on the morrow he shall

44
00:05:18,85 --> 00:05:19,85
 rise again; therefore bury him not

45
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:19,886
9 And Ammon said unto her: Believest thou this?

46
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:20,486
 And she said unto him: I have had no witness save

47
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,086
 thy word, and the word of our servants; nevertheless

48
00:05:21,086 --> 00:05:21,686
 I believe that it shall be according as thou hast

49
00:05:21,686 --> 00:05:22,286
 said

50
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:26,155
10 And Ammon said unto her: Blessed art thou

51
00:05:26,155 --> 00:05:30,155
 because of thy exceeding faith; I say unto thee, woman,

52
00:05:30,155 --> 00:05:34,155
 there has not been such great faith among all the

53
00:05:34,155 --> 00:05:38,155
 people of the Nephites

54
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:45,105
11 And it came to pass that she watched over the

55
00:05:45,105 --> 00:05:52,105
 bed of her husband, from that time even until that

56
00:05:52,105 --> 00:05:59,105
 time on the morrow which Ammon had appointed that

57
00:05:59,105 --> 00:06:06,105
 he should rise

58
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:12,334
12 And it came to pass that he arose, according to

59
00:06:12,334 --> 00:06:17,834
 the words of Ammon; and as he arose, he stretched

60
00:06:17,834 --> 00:06:23,334
 forth his hand unto the woman, and said: Blessed

61
00:06:23,334 --> 00:06:28,834
 be the name of God, and blessed art thou

62
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:35,193
13 For as sure as thou livest, behold, I have seen

63
00:06:35,193 --> 00:06:41,764
 my Redeemer; and he shall come forth, and be born

64
00:06:41,764 --> 00:06:48,335
 of a woman, and he shall redeem all mankind who

65
00:06:48,335 --> 00:06:54,906
 believe on his name. Now, when he had said these

66
00:06:54,906 --> 00:07:01,477
 words, his heart was swollen within him, and he sunk

67
00:07:01,477 --> 00:07:08,048
 again with joy; and the queen also sunk down,

68
00:07:08,048 --> 00:07:14,619
 being overpowered by the Spirit

69
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:17,235
14 Now Ammon seeing the Spirit of the Lord poured

70
00:07:17,235 --> 00:07:19,635
 out according to his prayers upon the Lamanites,

71
00:07:19,635 --> 00:07:22,035
 his brethren, who had been the cause of so much

72
00:07:22,035 --> 00:07:24,435
 mourning among the Nephites, or among all the people

73
00:07:24,435 --> 00:07:26,835
 of God because of their iniquities and their

74
00:07:26,835 --> 00:07:29,235
 traditions, he fell upon his knees, and began to pour

75
00:07:29,235 --> 00:07:31,635
 out his soul in prayer and thanksgiving to God for

76
00:07:31,635 --> 00:07:34,035
 what he had done for his brethren; and he was also

77
00:07:34,035 --> 00:07:36,435
 overpowered with joy; and thus they all three had

78
00:07:36,435 --> 00:07:38,835
 sunk to the earth

79
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:42,759
15 Now, when the servants of the king had seen

80
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:46,759
 that they had fallen, they also began to cry unto

81
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:50,759
 God, for the fear of the Lord had come upon them

82
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:54,759
 also, for it was they who had stood before the king

83
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:58,759
 and testified unto him concerning the great power of

84
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:02,759
 Ammon

85
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:04,016
16 And it came to pass that they did call on the

86
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,349
 name of the Lord, in their might, even until they

87
00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:06,682
 had all fallen to the earth, save it were one of

88
00:08:06,682 --> 00:08:08,015
 the Lamanitish women, whose name was Abish, she

89
00:08:08,015 --> 00:08:09,348
 having been converted unto the Lord for many years, on

90
00:08:09,348 --> 00:08:10,681
 account of a remarkable vision of her father

91
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:13,566
17 Thus, having been converted to the Lord, and

92
00:08:13,566 --> 00:08:16,475
 never having made it known, therefore, when she saw

93
00:08:16,475 --> 00:08:19,384
 that all the servants of Lamoni had fallen to the

94
00:08:19,384 --> 00:08:22,293
 earth, and also her mistress, the queen, and the

95
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:25,202
 king, and Ammon lay prostrate upon the earth, she

96
00:08:25,202 --> 00:08:28,111
 knew that it was the power of God; and supposing

97
00:08:28,111 --> 00:08:31,02
 that this opportunity, by making known unto the

98
00:08:31,02 --> 00:08:33,929
 people what had happened among them, that by beholding

99
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:36,838
 this scene it would cause them to believe in the

100
00:08:36,838 --> 00:08:39,747
 power of God, therefore she ran forth from house

101
00:08:39,747 --> 00:08:42,656
 to house, making it known unto the people

102
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:42,842
18 And they began to assemble themselves together

103
00:08:42,842 --> 00:08:43,128
 unto the house of the king. And there came a

104
00:08:43,128 --> 00:08:43,414
 multitude, and to their astonishment, they beheld the

105
00:08:43,414 --> 00:08:43,7
 king, and the queen, and their servants prostrate

106
00:08:43,7 --> 00:08:43,986
 upon the earth, and they all lay there as though

107
00:08:43,986 --> 00:08:44,272
 they were dead; and they also saw Ammon, and behold,

108
00:08:44,272 --> 00:08:44,558
 he was a Nephite

109
00:08:44,258 --> 00:08:45,858
19 And now the people began to murmur among

110
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,458
 themselves; some saying that it was a great evil that

111
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,058
 had come upon them, or upon the king and his house,

112
00:08:49,058 --> 00:08:50,658
 because he had suffered that the Nephite should

113
00:08:50,658 --> 00:08:52,258
 remain in the land

114
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:56,232
20 But others rebuked them, saying: The king hath

115
00:08:56,232 --> 00:09:00,232
 brought this evil upon his house, because he slew

116
00:09:00,232 --> 00:09:04,232
 his servants who had had their flocks scattered at

117
00:09:04,232 --> 00:09:08,232
 the waters of Sebus

118
00:09:08,182 --> 00:09:09,515
21 And they were also rebuked by those men who had

119
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:10,848
 stood at the waters of Sebus and scattered the

120
00:09:10,848 --> 00:09:12,181
 flocks which belonged to the king, for they were

121
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:13,514
 angry with Ammon because of the number which he had

122
00:09:13,514 --> 00:09:14,847
 slain of their brethren at the waters of Sebus,

123
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:16,18
 while defending the flocks of the king

124
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:18,823
22 Now, one of them, whose brother had been slain

125
00:09:18,823 --> 00:09:21,49
 with the sword of Ammon, being exceedingly angry

126
00:09:21,49 --> 00:09:24,157
 with Ammon, drew his sword and went forth that he

127
00:09:24,157 --> 00:09:26,824
 might let it fall upon Ammon, to slay him; and as

128
00:09:26,824 --> 00:09:29,491
 he lifted the sword to smite him, behold, he fell

129
00:09:29,491 --> 00:09:32,158
 dead

130
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:33,705
23 Now we see that Ammon could not be slain, for

131
00:09:33,705 --> 00:09:35,305
 the Lord had said unto Mosiah, his father: I will

132
00:09:35,305 --> 00:09:36,905
 spare him, and it shall be unto him according to

133
00:09:36,905 --> 00:09:38,505
 thy faith—therefore, Mosiah trusted him unto the

134
00:09:38,505 --> 00:09:40,105
 Lord

135
00:09:40,08 --> 00:09:41,08
24 And it came to pass that when the multitude

136
00:09:41,08 --> 00:09:42,08
 beheld that the man had fallen dead, who lifted the

137
00:09:42,08 --> 00:09:43,08
 sword to slay Ammon, fear came upon them all, and

138
00:09:43,08 --> 00:09:44,08
 they durst not put forth their hands to touch him

139
00:09:44,08 --> 00:09:45,08
 or any of those who had fallen; and they began to

140
00:09:45,08 --> 00:09:46,08
 marvel again among themselves what could be the

141
00:09:46,08 --> 00:09:47,08
 cause of this great power, or what all these things

142
00:09:47,08 --> 00:09:48,08
 could mean

143
00:09:48,055 --> 00:09:53,388
25 And it came to pass that there were many among

144
00:09:53,388 --> 00:09:58,721
 them who said that Ammon was the Great Spirit, and

145
00:09:58,721 --> 00:10:04,054
 others said he was sent by the Great Spirit

146
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:11,671
26 But others rebuked them all, saying that he was

147
00:10:11,671 --> 00:10:19,338
 a monster, who had been sent from the Nephites to

148
00:10:19,338 --> 00:10:27,005
 torment them

149
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:33,642
27 And there were some who said that Ammon was

150
00:10:33,642 --> 00:10:39,356
 sent by the Great Spirit to afflict them because of

151
00:10:39,356 --> 00:10:45,07
 their iniquities; and that it was the Great Spirit

152
00:10:45,07 --> 00:10:50,784
 that had always attended the Nephites, who had

153
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:56,498
 ever delivered them out of their hands; and they said

154
00:10:56,498 --> 00:11:02,212
 that it was this Great Spirit who had destroyed

155
00:11:02,212 --> 00:11:07,926
 so many of their brethren, the Lamanites

156
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:11,801
28 And thus the contention began to be exceedingly

157
00:11:11,801 --> 00:11:15,801
 sharp among them. And while they were thus

158
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:19,801
 contending, the woman servant who had caused the

159
00:11:19,801 --> 00:11:23,801
 multitude to be gathered together came, and when she saw

160
00:11:23,801 --> 00:11:27,801
 the contention which was among the multitude she

161
00:11:27,801 --> 00:11:31,801
 was exceedingly sorrowful, even unto tears

162
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:37,439
29 And it came to pass that she went and took the

163
00:11:37,439 --> 00:11:43,153
 queen by the hand, that perhaps she might raise

164
00:11:43,153 --> 00:11:48,867
 her from the ground; and as soon as she touched her

165
00:11:48,867 --> 00:11:54,581
 hand she arose and stood upon her feet, and cried

166
00:11:54,581 --> 00:12:00,295
 with a loud voice, saying: O blessed Jesus, who

167
00:12:00,295 --> 00:12:06,009
 has saved me from an awful hell! O blessed God, have

168
00:12:06,009 --> 00:12:11,723
 mercy on this people

169
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:14,798
30 And when she had said this, she clasped her

170
00:12:14,798 --> 00:12:17,998
 hands, being filled with joy, speaking many words

171
00:12:17,998 --> 00:12:21,198
 which were not understood; and when she had done

172
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:24,398
 this, she took the king, Lamoni, by the hand, and

173
00:12:24,398 --> 00:12:27,598
 behold he arose and stood upon his feet

174
00:12:27,548 --> 00:12:38,748
31 And he, immediately, seeing the contention

175
00:12:38,748 --> 00:12:49,948
 among his people, went forth and began to rebuke them,

176
00:12:49,948 --> 00:13:01,148
 and to teach them the words which he had heard

177
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:12,348
 from the mouth of Ammon; and as many as heard his

178
00:13:12,348 --> 00:13:23,548
 words believed, and were converted unto the Lord

179
00:13:23,37 --> 00:13:39,37
32 But there were many among them who would not

180
00:13:39,37 --> 00:13:55,37
 hear his words; therefore they went their way

181
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:57,936
33 And it came to pass that when Ammon arose he

182
00:13:57,936 --> 00:14:00,603
 also administered unto them, and also did all the

183
00:14:00,603 --> 00:14:03,27
 servants of Lamoni; and they did all declare unto

184
00:14:03,27 --> 00:14:05,937
 the people the selfsame thing—that their hearts had

185
00:14:05,937 --> 00:14:08,604
 been changed; that they had no more desire to do

186
00:14:08,604 --> 00:14:11,271
 evil

187
00:14:11,218 --> 00:14:15,218
34 And behold, many did declare unto the people

188
00:14:15,218 --> 00:14:19,218
 that they had seen angels and had conversed with

189
00:14:19,218 --> 00:14:23,218
 them; and thus they had told them things of God, and

190
00:14:23,218 --> 00:14:27,218
 of his righteousness

191
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:46,917
35 And it came to pass that there were many that

192
00:14:46,917 --> 00:15:06,667
 did believe in their words; and as many as did

193
00:15:06,667 --> 00:15:26,417
 believe were baptized; and they became a righteous

194
00:15:26,417 --> 00:15:46,167
 people, and they did establish a church among them

195
00:15:46,914 --> 00:15:47,114
36 And thus the work of the Lord did commence

196
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:47,314
 among the Lamanites; thus the Lord did begin to pour

197
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:47,514
 out his Spirit upon them; and we see that his arm

198
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:47,714
 is extended to all people who will repent and

199
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:47,914
 believe on his name.
