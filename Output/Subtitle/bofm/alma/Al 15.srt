00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:11,75
Chapter 15 Alma and Amulek go to Sidom and

2
00:00:11,75 --> 00:00:23,5
 establish a church—Alma heals Zeezrom, who joins the

3
00:00:23,5 --> 00:00:35,25
 Church—Many are baptized, and the Church prospers—Alma

4
00:00:35,25 --> 00:00:47,0
 and Amulek go to Zarahemla. About 81 B.C.

5
00:00:47,08 --> 00:00:52,223
1 And it came to pass that Alma and Amulek were

6
00:00:52,223 --> 00:00:57,366
 commanded to depart out of that city; and they

7
00:00:57,366 --> 00:01:02,509
 departed, and came out even into the land of Sidom; and

8
00:01:02,509 --> 00:01:07,652
 behold, there they found all the people who had

9
00:01:07,652 --> 00:01:12,795
 departed out of the land of Ammonihah, who had been

10
00:01:12,795 --> 00:01:17,938
 cast out and stoned, because they believed in the

11
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:23,081
 words of Alma

12
00:01:23,55 --> 00:01:29,217
2 And they related unto them all that had happened

13
00:01:29,217 --> 00:01:34,884
 unto their wives and children, and also

14
00:01:34,884 --> 00:01:40,551
 concerning themselves, and of their power of deliverance

15
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:46,967
3 And also Zeezrom lay sick at Sidom, with a

16
00:01:46,967 --> 00:01:53,3
 burning fever, which was caused by the great

17
00:01:53,3 --> 00:01:59,633
 tribulations of his mind on account of his wickedness, for

18
00:01:59,633 --> 00:02:05,966
 he supposed that Alma and Amulek were no more; and

19
00:02:05,966 --> 00:02:12,299
 he supposed that they had been slain because of

20
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:18,632
 his iniquity. And this great sin, and his many other

21
00:02:18,632 --> 00:02:24,965
 sins, did harrow up his mind until it did become

22
00:02:24,965 --> 00:02:31,298
 exceedingly sore, having no deliverance; therefore

23
00:02:31,298 --> 00:02:37,631
 he began to be scorched with a burning heat

24
00:02:37,29 --> 00:02:39,29
4 Now, when he heard that Alma and Amulek were in

25
00:02:39,29 --> 00:02:41,29
 the land of Sidom, his heart began to take

26
00:02:41,29 --> 00:02:43,29
 courage; and he sent a message immediately unto them,

27
00:02:43,29 --> 00:02:45,29
 desiring them to come unto him

28
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:52,14
5 And it came to pass that they went immediately,

29
00:02:52,14 --> 00:02:59,015
 obeying the message which he had sent unto them;

30
00:02:59,015 --> 00:03:05,89
 and they went in unto the house unto Zeezrom; and

31
00:03:05,89 --> 00:03:12,765
 they found him upon his bed, sick, being very low

32
00:03:12,765 --> 00:03:19,64
 with a burning fever; and his mind also was

33
00:03:19,64 --> 00:03:26,515
 exceedingly sore because of his iniquities; and when he

34
00:03:26,515 --> 00:03:33,39
 saw them he stretched forth his hand, and besought

35
00:03:33,39 --> 00:03:40,265
 them that they would heal him

36
00:03:40,12 --> 00:03:44,787
6 And it came to pass that Alma said unto him,

37
00:03:44,787 --> 00:03:49,454
 taking him by the hand: Believest thou in the power

38
00:03:49,454 --> 00:03:54,121
 of Christ unto salvation

39
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:59,435
7 And he answered and said: Yea, I believe all the

40
00:03:59,435 --> 00:04:03,935
 words that thou hast taught

41
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:10,477
8 And Alma said: If thou believest in the

42
00:04:10,477 --> 00:04:16,977
 redemption of Christ thou canst be healed

43
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:20,823
9 And he said: Yea, I believe according to thy

44
00:04:20,823 --> 00:04:24,823
 words

45
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:27,465
10 And then Alma cried unto the Lord, saying: O

46
00:04:27,465 --> 00:04:30,132
 Lord our God, have mercy on this man, and heal him

47
00:04:30,132 --> 00:04:32,799
 according to his faith which is in Christ

48
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:40,573
11 And when Alma had said these words, Zeezrom

49
00:04:40,573 --> 00:04:48,373
 leaped upon his feet, and began to walk; and this was

50
00:04:48,373 --> 00:04:56,173
 done to the great astonishment of all the people;

51
00:04:56,173 --> 00:05:03,973
 and the knowledge of this went forth throughout

52
00:05:03,973 --> 00:05:11,773
 all the land of Sidom

53
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:14,111
12 And Alma baptized Zeezrom unto the Lord; and he

54
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,778
 began from that time forth to preach unto the

55
00:05:16,778 --> 00:05:19,445
 people

56
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:26,919
13 And Alma established a church in the land of

57
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:34,419
 Sidom, and consecrated priests and teachers in the

58
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:41,919
 land, to baptize unto the Lord whosoever were

59
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:49,419
 desirous to be baptized

60
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:53,782
14 And it came to pass that they were many; for

61
00:05:53,782 --> 00:05:58,115
 they did flock in from all the region round about

62
00:05:58,115 --> 00:06:02,448
 Sidom, and were baptized

63
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:08,534
15 But as to the people that were in the land of

64
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:14,105
 Ammonihah, they yet remained a hard-hearted and a

65
00:06:14,105 --> 00:06:19,676
 stiffnecked people; and they repented not of their

66
00:06:19,676 --> 00:06:25,247
 sins, ascribing all the power of Alma and Amulek

67
00:06:25,247 --> 00:06:30,818
 to the devil; for they were of the profession of

68
00:06:30,818 --> 00:06:36,389
 Nehor, and did not believe in the repentance of

69
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:41,96
 their sins

70
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:47,001
16 And it came to pass that Alma and Amulek,

71
00:06:47,001 --> 00:06:52,334
 Amulek having forsaken all his gold, and silver, and

72
00:06:52,334 --> 00:06:57,667
 his precious things, which were in the land of

73
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:02,0
 Ammonihah, for the word of God, he being rejected by

74
00:07:02,0 --> 00:07:08,333
 those who were once his friends and also by his

75
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:13,666
 father and his kindred

76
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:19,455
17 Therefore, after Alma having established the

77
00:07:19,455 --> 00:07:25,344
 church at Sidom, seeing a great check, yea, seeing

78
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:31,233
 that the people were checked as to the pride of

79
00:07:31,233 --> 00:07:37,122
 their hearts, and began to humble themselves before

80
00:07:37,122 --> 00:07:43,011
 God, and began to assemble themselves together at

81
00:07:43,011 --> 00:07:48,9
 their sanctuaries to worship God before the altar,

82
00:07:48,9 --> 00:07:54,789
 watching and praying continually, that they might

83
00:07:54,789 --> 00:08:00,678
 be delivered from Satan, and from death, and from

84
00:08:00,678 --> 00:08:06,567
 destruction

85
00:08:06,72 --> 00:08:13,32
18 Now as I said, Alma having seen all these

86
00:08:13,32 --> 00:08:19,92
 things, therefore he took Amulek and came over to the

87
00:08:19,92 --> 00:08:26,52
 land of Zarahemla, and took him to his own house,

88
00:08:26,52 --> 00:08:33,12
 and did administer unto him in his tribulations,

89
00:08:33,12 --> 00:08:39,72
 and strengthened him in the Lord

90
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:42,486
19 And thus ended the tenth year of the reign of

91
00:08:42,486 --> 00:08:45,486
 the judges over the people of Nephi.
