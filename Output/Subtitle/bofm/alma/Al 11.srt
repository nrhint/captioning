00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:11,833
Chapter 11 The Nephite monetary system is set

2
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:23,666
 forth—Amulek contends with Zeezrom—Christ will not

3
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:35,499
 save people in their sins—Only those who inherit the

4
00:00:35,499 --> 00:00:47,332
 kingdom of heaven are saved—All men will rise in

5
00:00:47,332 --> 00:00:59,165
 immortality—There is no death after the

6
00:00:59,165 --> 00:01:10,998
 Resurrection. About 82 B.C.

7
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:18,172
1 Now it was in the law of Mosiah that every man

8
00:01:18,172 --> 00:01:24,572
 who was a judge of the law, or those who were

9
00:01:24,572 --> 00:01:30,972
 appointed to be judges, should receive wages according

10
00:01:30,972 --> 00:01:37,372
 to the time which they labored to judge those who

11
00:01:37,372 --> 00:01:43,772
 were brought before them to be judged

12
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:49,948
2 Now if a man owed another, and he would not pay

13
00:01:49,948 --> 00:01:56,392
 that which he did owe, he was complained of to the

14
00:01:56,392 --> 00:02:02,836
 judge; and the judge executed authority, and sent

15
00:02:02,836 --> 00:02:09,28
 forth officers that the man should be brought

16
00:02:09,28 --> 00:02:15,724
 before him; and he judged the man according to the

17
00:02:15,724 --> 00:02:22,168
 law and the evidences which were brought against

18
00:02:22,168 --> 00:02:28,612
 him, and thus the man was compelled to pay that which

19
00:02:28,612 --> 00:02:35,056
 he owed, or be stripped, or be cast out from

20
00:02:35,056 --> 00:02:41,5
 among the people as a thief and a robber

21
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:47,978
3 And the judge received for his wages according

22
00:02:47,978 --> 00:02:54,728
 to his time—a senine of gold for a day, or a senum

23
00:02:54,728 --> 00:03:01,478
 of silver, which is equal to a senine of gold; and

24
00:03:01,478 --> 00:03:08,228
 this is according to the law which was given

25
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:14,855
4 Now these are the names of the different pieces

26
00:03:14,855 --> 00:03:21,255
 of their gold, and of their silver, according to

27
00:03:21,255 --> 00:03:27,655
 their value. And the names are given by the

28
00:03:27,655 --> 00:03:34,055
 Nephites, for they did not reckon after the manner of the

29
00:03:34,055 --> 00:03:40,455
 Jews who were at Jerusalem; neither did they

30
00:03:40,455 --> 00:03:46,855
 measure after the manner of the Jews; but they altered

31
00:03:46,855 --> 00:03:53,255
 their reckoning and their measure, according to

32
00:03:53,255 --> 00:03:59,655
 the minds and the circumstances of the people, in

33
00:03:59,655 --> 00:04:06,055
 every generation, until the reign of the judges,

34
00:04:06,055 --> 00:04:12,455
 they having been established by king Mosiah

35
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:23,686
5 Now the reckoning is thus—a senine of gold, a

36
00:04:23,686 --> 00:04:34,686
 seon of gold, a shum of gold, and a limnah of gold

37
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:42,507
6 A senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom

38
00:04:42,507 --> 00:04:51,007
 of silver, and an onti of silver

39
00:04:51,892 --> 00:05:00,225
7 A senum of silver was equal to a senine of gold,

40
00:05:00,225 --> 00:05:08,558
 and either for a measure of barley, and also for

41
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:16,891
 a measure of every kind of grain

42
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:22,683
8 Now the amount of a seon of gold was twice the

43
00:05:22,683 --> 00:05:28,683
 value of a senine

44
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:32,962
9 And a shum of gold was twice the value of a

45
00:05:32,962 --> 00:05:37,462
 seon

46
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:42,771
10 And a limnah of gold was the value of them all

47
00:05:42,771 --> 00:05:47,771


48
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:53,314
11 And an amnor of silver was as great as two

49
00:05:53,314 --> 00:05:58,814
 senums

50
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:03,592
12 And an ezrom of silver was as great as four

51
00:06:03,592 --> 00:06:08,592
 senums

52
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:16,902
13 And an onti was as great as them all

53
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:22,143
14 Now this is the value of the lesser numbers of

54
00:06:22,143 --> 00:06:27,643
 their reckoning

55
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:34,121
15 A shiblon is half of a senum; therefore, a

56
00:06:34,121 --> 00:06:40,621
 shiblon for half a measure of barley

57
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:48,667
16 And a shiblum is a half of a shiblon

58
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:55,642
17 And a leah is the half of a shiblum

59
00:06:55,215 --> 00:07:19,215
18 Now this is their number, according to their

60
00:07:19,215 --> 00:07:43,215
 reckoning

61
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:43,063
19 Now an antion of gold is equal to three

62
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:43,063
 shiblons

63
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:46,972
20 Now, it was for the sole purpose to get gain,

64
00:07:46,972 --> 00:07:50,347
 because they received their wages according to

65
00:07:50,347 --> 00:07:53,722
 their employ, therefore, they did stir up the people

66
00:07:53,722 --> 00:07:57,097
 to riotings, and all manner of disturbances and

67
00:07:57,097 --> 00:08:00,472
 wickedness, that they might have more employ, that

68
00:08:00,472 --> 00:08:03,847
 they might get money according to the suits which

69
00:08:03,847 --> 00:08:07,222
 were brought before them; therefore they did stir up

70
00:08:07,222 --> 00:08:10,597
 the people against Alma and Amulek

71
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:16,057
21 And this Zeezrom began to question Amulek,

72
00:08:16,057 --> 00:08:22,057
 saying: Will ye answer me a few questions which I

73
00:08:22,057 --> 00:08:28,057
 shall ask you? Now Zeezrom was a man who was expert in

74
00:08:28,057 --> 00:08:34,057
 the devices of the devil, that he might destroy

75
00:08:34,057 --> 00:08:40,057
 that which was good; therefore, he said unto

76
00:08:40,057 --> 00:08:46,057
 Amulek: Will ye answer the questions which I shall put

77
00:08:46,057 --> 00:08:52,057
 unto you

78
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:58,68
22 And Amulek said unto him: Yea, if it be

79
00:08:58,68 --> 00:09:04,394
 according to the Spirit of the Lord, which is in me; for

80
00:09:04,394 --> 00:09:10,108
 I shall say nothing which is contrary to the

81
00:09:10,108 --> 00:09:15,822
 Spirit of the Lord. And Zeezrom said unto him: Behold,

82
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:21,536
 here are six onties of silver, and all these will

83
00:09:21,536 --> 00:09:27,25
 I give thee if thou wilt deny the existence of a

84
00:09:27,25 --> 00:09:32,964
 Supreme Being

85
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:38,806
23 Now Amulek said: O thou child of hell, why

86
00:09:38,806 --> 00:09:45,473
 tempt ye me? Knowest thou that the righteous yieldeth

87
00:09:45,473 --> 00:09:52,14
 to no such temptations

88
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:59,659
24 Believest thou that there is no God? I say unto

89
00:09:59,659 --> 00:10:06,659
 you, Nay, thou knowest that there is a God, but

90
00:10:06,659 --> 00:10:13,659
 thou lovest that lucre more than him

91
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:20,497
25 And now thou hast lied before God unto me. Thou

92
00:10:20,497 --> 00:10:27,247
 saidst unto me—Behold these six onties, which are

93
00:10:27,247 --> 00:10:33,997
 of great worth, I will give unto thee—when thou

94
00:10:33,997 --> 00:10:40,747
 hadst it in thy heart to retain them from me; and

95
00:10:40,747 --> 00:10:47,497
 it was only thy desire that I should deny the true

96
00:10:47,497 --> 00:10:54,247
 and living God, that thou mightest have cause to

97
00:10:54,247 --> 00:11:00,997
 destroy me. And now behold, for this great evil

98
00:11:00,997 --> 00:11:07,747
 thou shalt have thy reward

99
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:14,101
26 And Zeezrom said unto him: Thou sayest there is

100
00:11:14,101 --> 00:11:20,601
 a true and living God

101
00:11:20,614 --> 00:11:26,614
27 And Amulek said: Yea, there is a true and

102
00:11:26,614 --> 00:11:32,614
 living God

103
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:42,693
28 Now Zeezrom said: Is there more than one God

104
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:47,703
29 And he answered, No

105
00:11:47,14 --> 00:11:51,14
30 Now Zeezrom said unto him again: How knowest

106
00:11:51,14 --> 00:11:55,14
 thou these things

107
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:59,983
31 And he said: An angel hath made them known unto

108
00:11:59,983 --> 00:12:03,983
 me

109
00:12:03,257 --> 00:12:10,257
32 And Zeezrom said again: Who is he that shall

110
00:12:10,257 --> 00:12:17,257
 come? Is it the Son of God

111
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:21,037
33 And he said unto him, Yea

112
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:27,625
34 And Zeezrom said again: Shall he save his

113
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:33,875
 people in their sins? And Amulek answered and said unto

114
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:40,125
 him: I say unto you he shall not, for it is

115
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:46,375
 impossible for him to deny his word

116
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:52,966
35 Now Zeezrom said unto the people: See that ye

117
00:12:52,966 --> 00:12:59,766
 remember these things; for he said there is but one

118
00:12:59,766 --> 00:13:06,566
 God; yet he saith that the Son of God shall come,

119
00:13:06,566 --> 00:13:13,366
 but he shall not save his people—as though he had

120
00:13:13,366 --> 00:13:20,166
 authority to command God

121
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:26,917
36 Now Amulek saith again unto him: Behold thou

122
00:13:26,917 --> 00:13:33,167
 hast lied, for thou sayest that I spake as though I

123
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:39,417
 had authority to command God because I said he

124
00:13:39,417 --> 00:13:45,667
 shall not save his people in their sins

125
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:53,759
37 And I say unto you again that he cannot save

126
00:13:53,759 --> 00:14:01,592
 them in their sins; for I cannot deny his word, and

127
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:09,425
 he hath said that no unclean thing can inherit the

128
00:14:09,425 --> 00:14:17,258
 kingdom of heaven; therefore, how can ye be

129
00:14:17,258 --> 00:14:25,091
 saved, except ye inherit the kingdom of heaven?

130
00:14:25,091 --> 00:14:32,924
 Therefore, ye cannot be saved in your sins

131
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:38,306
38 Now Zeezrom saith again unto him: Is the Son of

132
00:14:38,306 --> 00:14:43,806
 God the very Eternal Father

133
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:49,817
39 And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very

134
00:14:49,817 --> 00:14:55,817
 Eternal Father of heaven and of earth, and all

135
00:14:55,817 --> 00:15:01,817
 things which in them are; he is the beginning and the

136
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:07,817
 end, the first and the last

137
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:13,741
40 And he shall come into the world to redeem his

138
00:15:13,741 --> 00:15:19,741
 people; and he shall take upon him the

139
00:15:19,741 --> 00:15:25,741
 transgressions of those who believe on his name; and these

140
00:15:25,741 --> 00:15:31,741
 are they that shall have eternal life, and salvation

141
00:15:31,741 --> 00:15:37,741
 cometh to none else

142
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:42,771
41 Therefore the wicked remain as though there had

143
00:15:42,771 --> 00:15:47,571
 been no redemption made, except it be the loosing

144
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:52,371
 of the bands of death; for behold, the day cometh

145
00:15:52,371 --> 00:15:57,171
 that all shall rise from the dead and stand

146
00:15:57,171 --> 00:16:01,971
 before God, and be judged according to their works

147
00:16:01,895 --> 00:16:03,895
42 Now, there is a death which is called a

148
00:16:03,895 --> 00:16:05,895
 temporal death; and the death of Christ shall loose the

149
00:16:05,895 --> 00:16:07,895
 bands of this temporal death, that all shall be

150
00:16:07,895 --> 00:16:09,895
 raised from this temporal death

151
00:16:09,87 --> 00:16:10,037
43 The spirit and the body shall be reunited again

152
00:16:10,037 --> 00:16:10,204
 in its perfect form; both limb and joint shall be

153
00:16:10,204 --> 00:16:10,371
 restored to its proper frame, even as we now are

154
00:16:10,371 --> 00:16:10,538
 at this time; and we shall be brought to stand

155
00:16:10,538 --> 00:16:10,705
 before God, knowing even as we know now, and have a

156
00:16:10,705 --> 00:16:10,872
 bright recollection of all our guilt

157
00:16:10,871 --> 00:16:11,598
44 Now, this restoration shall come to all, both

158
00:16:11,598 --> 00:16:12,325
 old and young, both bond and free, both male and

159
00:16:12,325 --> 00:16:13,052
 female, both the wicked and the righteous; and even

160
00:16:13,052 --> 00:16:13,779
 there shall not so much as a hair of their heads

161
00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:14,506
 be lost; but every thing shall be restored to its

162
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:15,233
 perfect frame, as it is now, or in the body, and

163
00:16:15,233 --> 00:16:15,96
 shall be brought and be arraigned before the bar of

164
00:16:15,96 --> 00:16:16,687
 Christ the Son, and God the Father, and the Holy

165
00:16:16,687 --> 00:16:17,414
 Spirit, which is one Eternal God, to be judged

166
00:16:17,414 --> 00:16:18,141
 according to their works, whether they be good or

167
00:16:18,141 --> 00:16:18,868
 whether they be evil

168
00:16:18,846 --> 00:16:19,735
45 Now, behold, I have spoken unto you concerning

169
00:16:19,735 --> 00:16:20,624
 the death of the mortal body, and also concerning

170
00:16:20,624 --> 00:16:21,513
 the resurrection of the mortal body. I say unto

171
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:22,402
 you that this mortal body is raised to an immortal

172
00:16:22,402 --> 00:16:23,291
 body, that is from death, even from the first death

173
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:24,18
 unto life, that they can die no more; their

174
00:16:24,18 --> 00:16:25,069
 spirits uniting with their bodies, never to be divided;

175
