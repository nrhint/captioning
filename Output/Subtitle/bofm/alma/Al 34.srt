1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:11,111
Chapter 34 Amulek testifies that the word is in

2
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:22,222
 Christ unto salvation—Unless an atonement is made,

3
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:33,333
 all mankind must perish—The whole law of Moses

4
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:44,444
 points toward the sacrifice of the Son of God—The

5
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:55,555
 eternal plan of redemption is based on faith and

6
00:00:55,555 --> 00:01:06,666
 repentance—Pray for temporal and spiritual

7
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:17,777
 blessings—This life is the time for men to prepare to meet

8
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:28,888
 God—Work out your salvation with fear before God.

9
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:39,999
 About 74 B.C.

10
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:42,367
1 And now it came to pass that after Alma had

11
00:01:42,367 --> 00:01:44,367
 spoken these words unto them he sat down upon the

12
00:01:44,367 --> 00:01:46,367
 ground, and Amulek arose and began to teach them,

13
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:48,367
 saying

14
00:01:48,342 --> 00:02:09,509
2 My brethren, I think that it is impossible that

15
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:30,676
 ye should be ignorant of the things which have

16
00:02:30,676 --> 00:02:51,843
 been spoken concerning the coming of Christ, who is

17
00:02:51,843 --> 00:03:13,01
 taught by us to be the Son of God; yea, I know that

18
00:03:13,01 --> 00:03:34,177
 these things were taught unto you bountifully

19
00:03:34,177 --> 00:03:55,344
 before your dissension from among us

20
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:59,136
3 And as ye have desired of my beloved brother

21
00:03:59,136 --> 00:04:02,336
 that he should make known unto you what ye should do,

22
00:04:02,336 --> 00:04:05,536
 because of your afflictions; and he hath spoken

23
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:08,736
 somewhat unto you to prepare your minds; yea, and

24
00:04:08,736 --> 00:04:11,936
 he hath exhorted you unto faith and to patience

25
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:30,552
4 Yea, even that ye would have so much faith as

26
00:04:30,552 --> 00:04:49,219
 even to plant the word in your hearts, that ye may

27
00:04:49,219 --> 00:05:07,886
 try the experiment of its goodness

28
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:21,04
5 And we have beheld that the great question which

29
00:05:21,04 --> 00:05:34,373
 is in your minds is whether the word be in the

30
00:05:34,373 --> 00:05:47,706
 Son of God, or whether there shall be no Christ

31
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:52,914
6 And ye also beheld that my brother has proved

32
00:05:52,914 --> 00:05:58,247
 unto you, in many instances, that the word is in

33
00:05:58,247 --> 00:06:03,58
 Christ unto salvation

34
00:06:03,53 --> 00:06:11,53
7 My brother has called upon the words of Zenos,

35
00:06:11,53 --> 00:06:19,53
 that redemption cometh through the Son of God, and

36
00:06:19,53 --> 00:06:27,53
 also upon the words of Zenock; and also he has

37
00:06:27,53 --> 00:06:35,53
 appealed unto Moses, to prove that these things are

38
00:06:35,53 --> 00:06:43,53
 true

39
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,546
8 And now, behold, I will testify unto you of

40
00:06:44,546 --> 00:06:45,689
 myself that these things are true. Behold, I say unto

41
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:46,832
 you, that I do know that Christ shall come among

42
00:06:46,832 --> 00:06:47,975
 the children of men, to take upon him the

43
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:49,118
 transgressions of his people, and that he shall atone for

44
00:06:49,118 --> 00:06:50,261
 the sins of the world; for the Lord God hath spoken

45
00:06:50,261 --> 00:06:51,404
 it

46
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:55,949
9 For it is expedient that an atonement should be

47
00:06:55,949 --> 00:07:00,52
 made; for according to the great plan of the

48
00:07:00,52 --> 00:07:05,091
 Eternal God there must be an atonement made, or else

49
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:09,662
 all mankind must unavoidably perish; yea, all are

50
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:14,233
 hardened; yea, all are fallen and are lost, and must

51
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:18,804
 perish except it be through the atonement which

52
00:07:18,804 --> 00:07:23,375
 it is expedient should be made

53
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,876
10 For it is expedient that there should be a

54
00:07:24,876 --> 00:07:26,476
 great and last sacrifice; yea, not a sacrifice of man,

55
00:07:26,476 --> 00:07:28,076
 neither of beast, neither of any manner of fowl;

56
00:07:28,076 --> 00:07:29,676
 for it shall not be a human sacrifice; but it must

57
00:07:29,676 --> 00:07:31,276
 be an infinite and eternal sacrifice

58
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:32,851
11 Now there is not any man that can sacrifice his

59
00:07:32,851 --> 00:07:34,451
 own blood which will atone for the sins of

60
00:07:34,451 --> 00:07:36,051
 another. Now, if a man murdereth, behold will our law,

61
00:07:36,051 --> 00:07:37,651
 which is just, take the life of his brother? I say

62
00:07:37,651 --> 00:07:39,251
 unto you, Nay

63
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:39,225
12 But the law requireth the life of him who hath

64
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:39,225
 murdered; therefore there can be nothing which is

65
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:39,225
 short of an infinite atonement which will suffice

66
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:39,225
 for the sins of the world

67
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:43,507
13 Therefore, it is expedient that there should be

68
00:07:43,507 --> 00:07:47,221
 a great and last sacrifice, and then shall there

69
00:07:47,221 --> 00:07:50,935
 be, or it is expedient there should be, a stop to

70
00:07:50,935 --> 00:07:54,649
 the shedding of blood; then shall the law of Moses

71
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:58,363
 be fulfilled; yea, it shall be all fulfilled,

72
00:07:58,363 --> 00:08:02,077
 every jot and tittle, and none shall have passed

73
00:08:02,077 --> 00:08:05,791
 away

74
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:13,335
14 And behold, this is the whole meaning of the

75
00:08:13,335 --> 00:08:21,085
 law, every whit pointing to that great and last

76
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:28,835
 sacrifice; and that great and last sacrifice will be

77
00:08:28,835 --> 00:08:36,585
 the Son of God, yea, infinite and eternal

78
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:42,916
15 And thus he shall bring salvation to all those

79
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:49,416
 who shall believe on his name; this being the

80
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:55,916
 intent of this last sacrifice, to bring about the

81
00:08:55,916 --> 00:09:02,416
 bowels of mercy, which overpowereth justice, and

82
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:08,916
 bringeth about means unto men that they may have faith

83
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:15,416
 unto repentance

84
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:23,536
16 And thus mercy can satisfy the demands of

85
00:09:23,536 --> 00:09:31,25
 justice, and encircles them in the arms of safety,

86
00:09:31,25 --> 00:09:38,964
 while he that exercises no faith unto repentance is

87
00:09:38,964 --> 00:09:46,678
 exposed to the whole law of the demands of justice;

88
00:09:46,678 --> 00:09:54,392
 therefore only unto him that has faith unto

89
00:09:54,392 --> 00:10:02,106
 repentance is brought about the great and eternal plan

90
00:10:02,106 --> 00:10:09,82
 of redemption

91
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:15,809
17 Therefore may God grant unto you, my brethren,

92
00:10:15,809 --> 00:10:22,309
 that ye may begin to exercise your faith unto

93
00:10:22,309 --> 00:10:28,809
 repentance, that ye begin to call upon his holy name,

94
00:10:28,809 --> 00:10:35,309
 that he would have mercy upon you

95
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:42,869
18 Yea, cry unto him for mercy; for he is mighty

96
00:10:42,869 --> 00:10:49,869
 to save

97
00:10:49,149 --> 00:11:20,649
19 Yea, humble yourselves, and continue in prayer

98
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:52,149
 unto him

99
00:11:52,946 --> 00:12:00,946
20 Cry unto him when ye are in your fields, yea,

100
00:12:00,946 --> 00:12:08,946
 over all your flocks

101
00:12:08,895 --> 00:13:04,895
21 Cry unto him in your houses, yea, over all your

102
00:13:04,895 --> 00:14:00,895
 household, both morning, mid-day, and evening

103
00:14:00,54 --> 00:14:24,54
22 Yea, cry unto him against the power of your

104
00:14:24,54 --> 00:14:48,54
 enemies

105
00:14:48,388 --> 00:15:00,388
23 Yea, cry unto him against the devil, who is an

106
00:15:00,388 --> 00:15:12,388
 enemy to all righteousness

107
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:24,311
24 Cry unto him over the crops of your fields,

108
00:15:24,311 --> 00:15:36,311
 that ye may prosper in them

109
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:48,235
25 Cry over the flocks of your fields, that they

110
00:15:48,235 --> 00:16:00,235
 may increase

111
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:05,492
26 But this is not all; ye must pour out your

112
00:16:05,492 --> 00:16:10,825
 souls in your closets, and your secret places, and in

113
00:16:10,825 --> 00:16:16,158
 your wilderness

114
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:24,108
27 Yea, and when you do not cry unto the Lord, let

115
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:32,108
 your hearts be full, drawn out in prayer unto him

116
00:16:32,108 --> 00:16:40,108
 continually for your welfare, and also for the

117
00:16:40,108 --> 00:16:48,108
 welfare of those who are around you

118
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:48,785
28 And now behold, my beloved brethren, I say unto

119
00:16:48,785 --> 00:16:49,563
 you, do not suppose that this is all; for after

120
00:16:49,563 --> 00:16:50,341
 ye have done all these things, if ye turn away the

121
00:16:50,341 --> 00:16:51,119
 needy, and the naked, and visit not the sick and

122
00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:51,897
 afflicted, and impart of your substance, if ye

123
00:16:51,897 --> 00:16:52,675
 have, to those who stand in need—I say unto you, if ye

124
00:16:52,675 --> 00:16:53,453
 do not any of these things, behold, your prayer

125
00:16:53,453 --> 00:16:54,231
 is vain, and availeth you nothing, and ye are as

126
00:16:54,231 --> 00:16:55,009
 hypocrites who do deny the faith

127
00:16:55,982 --> 00:17:03,982
29 Therefore, if ye do not remember to be

128
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:11,982
 charitable, ye are as dross, which the refiners do cast

129
00:17:11,982 --> 00:17:19,982
 out, (it being of no worth) and is trodden under

130
00:17:19,982 --> 00:17:27,982
 foot of men

131
00:17:27,88 --> 00:17:33,88
30 And now, my brethren, I would that, after ye

132
00:17:33,88 --> 00:17:39,88
 have received so many witnesses, seeing that the

133
00:17:39,88 --> 00:17:45,88
 holy scriptures testify of these things, ye come

134
00:17:45,88 --> 00:17:51,88
 forth and bring fruit unto repentance

135
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:54,471
31 Yea, I would that ye would come forth and

136
00:17:54,471 --> 00:17:57,138
 harden not your hearts any longer; for behold, now is

137
00:17:57,138 --> 00:17:59,805
 the time and the day of your salvation; and

138
00:17:59,805 --> 00:18:02,472
 therefore, if ye will repent and harden not your hearts,

139
00:18:02,472 --> 00:18:05,139
 immediately shall the great plan of redemption be

140
00:18:05,139 --> 00:18:07,806
 brought about unto you

141
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:50,42
32 For behold, this life is the time for men to

142
00:18:50,42 --> 00:19:33,087
 prepare to meet God; yea, behold the day of this

143
00:19:33,087 --> 00:20:15,754
 life is the day for men to perform their labors

144
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:18,347
33 And now, as I said unto you before, as ye have

145
00:20:18,347 --> 00:20:21,347
 had so many witnesses, therefore, I beseech of you

146
00:20:21,347 --> 00:20:24,347
 that ye do not procrastinate the day of your

147
00:20:24,347 --> 00:20:27,347
 repentance until the end; for after this day of life,

148
00:20:27,347 --> 00:20:30,347
 which is given us to prepare for eternity, behold,

149
00:20:30,347 --> 00:20:33,347
 if we do not improve our time while in this life,

150
00:20:33,347 --> 00:20:36,347
 then cometh the night of darkness wherein there

151
00:20:36,347 --> 00:20:39,347
 can be no labor performed

152
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:41,557
34 Ye cannot say, when ye are brought to that

153
00:20:41,557 --> 00:20:43,843
 awful crisis, that I will repent, that I will return

154
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:46,129
 to my God. Nay, ye cannot say this; for that same

155
00:20:46,129 --> 00:20:48,415
 spirit which doth possess your bodies at the time

156
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:50,701
 that ye go out of this life, that same spirit will

157
00:20:50,701 --> 00:20:52,987
 have power to possess your body in that eternal

158
00:20:52,987 --> 00:20:55,273
 world

159
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:57,507
35 For behold, if ye have procrastinated the day

160
00:20:57,507 --> 00:20:59,793
 of your repentance even until death, behold, ye

161
00:20:59,793 --> 00:21:02,079
 have become subjected to the spirit of the devil, and

162
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,365
 he doth seal you his; therefore, the Spirit of

163
00:21:04,365 --> 00:21:06,651
 the Lord hath withdrawn from you, and hath no place

164
00:21:06,651 --> 00:21:08,937
 in you, and the devil hath all power over you; and

165
00:21:08,937 --> 00:21:11,223
 this is the final state of the wicked

166
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:48,241
38 That ye contend no more against the Holy Ghost,

167
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:52,812
 but that ye receive it, and take upon you the

168
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:57,383
 name of Christ; that ye humble yourselves even to the

169
00:01:57,383 --> 00:02:01,954
 dust, and worship God, in whatsoever place ye may

170
00:02:01,954 --> 00:02:06,525
 be in, in spirit and in truth; and that ye live

171
00:02:06,525 --> 00:02:11,096
 in thanksgiving daily, for the many mercies and

172
00:02:11,096 --> 00:02:15,667
 blessings which he doth bestow upon you

173
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:28,902
39 Yea, and I also exhort you, my brethren, that

174
00:02:28,902 --> 00:02:42,235
 ye be watchful unto prayer continually, that ye may

175
00:02:42,235 --> 00:02:55,568
 not be led away by the temptations of the devil,

176
00:02:55,568 --> 00:03:08,901
 that he may not overpower you, that ye may not

177
00:03:08,901 --> 00:03:22,234
 become his subjects at the last day; for behold, he

178
00:03:22,234 --> 00:03:35,567
 rewardeth you no good thing

179
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:40,115
40 And now my beloved brethren, I would exhort you

180
00:03:40,115 --> 00:03:44,915
 to have patience, and that ye bear with all

181
00:03:44,915 --> 00:03:49,715
 manner of afflictions; that ye do not revile against

182
00:03:49,715 --> 00:03:54,515
 those who do cast you out because of your exceeding

183
00:03:54,515 --> 00:03:59,315
 poverty, lest ye become sinners like unto them

184
00:03:59,239 --> 00:03:59,239
41 But that ye have patience, and bear with those

185
00:03:59,239 --> 00:03:59,239
 afflictions, with a firm hope that ye shall one

186
00:03:59,239 --> 00:03:59,239
 day rest from all your afflictions.
