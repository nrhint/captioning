00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:08,833
Chapter 22 Aaron teaches Lamoni’s father about the

2
00:00:08,833 --> 00:00:17,666
 Creation, the Fall of Adam, and the plan of

3
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:26,499
 redemption through Christ—The king and all his

4
00:00:26,499 --> 00:00:35,332
 household are converted—The division of the land between

5
00:00:35,332 --> 00:00:44,165
 the Nephites and the Lamanites is explained. About

6
00:00:44,165 --> 00:00:52,998
 90–77 B.C.

7
00:00:53,921 --> 00:01:07,635
1 Now, as Ammon was thus teaching the people of

8
00:01:07,635 --> 00:01:21,349
 Lamoni continually, we will return to the account of

9
00:01:21,349 --> 00:01:35,063
 Aaron and his brethren; for after he departed

10
00:01:35,063 --> 00:01:48,777
 from the land of Middoni he was led by the Spirit to

11
00:01:48,777 --> 00:02:02,491
 the land of Nephi, even to the house of the king

12
00:02:02,491 --> 00:02:16,205
 which was over all the land save it were the land

13
00:02:16,205 --> 00:02:29,919
 of Ishmael; and he was the father of Lamoni

14
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:34,016
2 And it came to pass that he went in unto him

15
00:02:34,016 --> 00:02:38,416
 into the king’s palace, with his brethren, and bowed

16
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:42,816
 himself before the king, and said unto him:

17
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:47,216
 Behold, O king, we are the brethren of Ammon, whom thou

18
00:02:47,216 --> 00:02:51,616
 hast delivered out of prison

19
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:58,271
3 And now, O king, if thou wilt spare our lives,

20
00:02:58,271 --> 00:03:05,371
 we will be thy servants. And the king said unto

21
00:03:05,371 --> 00:03:12,471
 them: Arise, for I will grant unto you your lives,

22
00:03:12,471 --> 00:03:19,571
 and I will not suffer that ye shall be my servants;

23
00:03:19,571 --> 00:03:26,671
 but I will insist that ye shall administer unto

24
00:03:26,671 --> 00:03:33,771
 me; for I have been somewhat troubled in mind

25
00:03:33,771 --> 00:03:40,871
 because of the generosity and the greatness of the words

26
00:03:40,871 --> 00:03:47,971
 of thy brother Ammon; and I desire to know the

27
00:03:47,971 --> 00:03:55,071
 cause why he has not come up out of Middoni with

28
00:03:55,071 --> 00:04:02,171
 thee

29
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:14,943
4 And Aaron said unto the king: Behold, the Spirit

30
00:04:14,943 --> 00:04:26,943
 of the Lord has called him another way; he has

31
00:04:26,943 --> 00:04:38,943
 gone to the land of Ishmael, to teach the people of

32
00:04:38,943 --> 00:04:50,943
 Lamoni

33
00:04:50,791 --> 00:05:14,791
5 Now the king said unto them: What is this that

34
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:38,791
 ye have said concerning the Spirit of the Lord?

35
00:05:38,791 --> 00:06:02,791
 Behold, this is the thing which doth trouble me

36
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:07,895
6 And also, what is this that Ammon said—If ye

37
00:06:07,895 --> 00:06:13,228
 will repent ye shall be saved, and if ye will not

38
00:06:13,228 --> 00:06:18,561
 repent, ye shall be cast off at the last day

39
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:19,654
7 And Aaron answered him and said unto him:

40
00:06:19,654 --> 00:06:20,797
 Believest thou that there is a God? And the king said: I

41
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:21,94
 know that the Amalekites say that there is a God,

42
00:06:21,94 --> 00:06:23,083
 and I have granted unto them that they should

43
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,226
 build sanctuaries, that they may assemble themselves

44
00:06:24,226 --> 00:06:25,369
 together to worship him. And if now thou sayest

45
00:06:25,369 --> 00:06:26,512
 there is a God, behold I will believe

46
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:34,486
8 And now when Aaron heard this, his heart began

47
00:06:34,486 --> 00:06:42,486
 to rejoice, and he said: Behold, assuredly as thou

48
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:50,486
 livest, O king, there is a God

49
00:06:50,41 --> 00:07:01,077
9 And the king said: Is God that Great Spirit that

50
00:07:01,077 --> 00:07:11,744
 brought our fathers out of the land of Jerusalem

51
00:07:11,744 --> 00:07:22,411


52
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:24,976
10 And Aaron said unto him: Yea, he is that Great

53
00:07:24,976 --> 00:07:27,643
 Spirit, and he created all things both in heaven

54
00:07:27,643 --> 00:07:30,31
 and in earth. Believest thou this

55
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,283
11 And he said: Yea, I believe that the Great

56
00:07:32,283 --> 00:07:34,283
 Spirit created all things, and I desire that ye should

57
00:07:34,283 --> 00:07:36,283
 tell me concerning all these things, and I will

58
00:07:36,283 --> 00:07:38,283
 believe thy words

59
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:38,258
12 And it came to pass that when Aaron saw that

60
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:38,258
 the king would believe his words, he began from the

61
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:38,258
 creation of Adam, reading the scriptures unto the

62
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:38,258
 king—how God created man after his own image, and

63
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:38,258
 that God gave him commandments, and that because

64
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:38,258
 of transgression, man had fallen

65
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:41,025
13 And Aaron did expound unto him the scriptures

66
00:07:41,025 --> 00:07:43,192
 from the creation of Adam, laying the fall of man

67
00:07:43,192 --> 00:07:45,359
 before him, and their carnal state and also the

68
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:47,526
 plan of redemption, which was prepared from the

69
00:07:47,526 --> 00:07:49,693
 foundation of the world, through Christ, for all

70
00:07:49,693 --> 00:07:51,86
 whosoever would believe on his name

71
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:59,222
14 And since man had fallen he could not merit

72
00:07:59,222 --> 00:08:06,472
 anything of himself; but the sufferings and death of

73
00:08:06,472 --> 00:08:13,722
 Christ atone for their sins, through faith and

74
00:08:13,722 --> 00:08:20,972
 repentance, and so forth; and that he breaketh the

75
00:08:20,972 --> 00:08:28,222
 bands of death, that the grave shall have no

76
00:08:28,222 --> 00:08:35,472
 victory, and that the sting of death should be swallowed

77
00:08:35,472 --> 00:08:42,722
 up in the hopes of glory; and Aaron did expound

78
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:49,972
 all these things unto the king

79
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:56,396
15 And it came to pass that after Aaron had

80
00:08:56,396 --> 00:09:03,396
 expounded these things unto him, the king said: What

81
00:09:03,396 --> 00:09:10,396
 shall I do that I may have this eternal life of which

82
00:09:10,396 --> 00:09:17,396
 thou hast spoken? Yea, what shall I do that I may

83
00:09:17,396 --> 00:09:24,396
 be born of God, having this wicked spirit rooted

84
00:09:24,396 --> 00:09:31,396
 out of my breast, and receive his Spirit, that I

85
00:09:31,396 --> 00:09:38,396
 may be filled with joy, that I may not be cast off

86
00:09:38,396 --> 00:09:45,396
 at the last day? Behold, said he, I will give up

87
00:09:45,396 --> 00:09:52,396
 all that I possess, yea, I will forsake my kingdom,

88
00:09:52,396 --> 00:09:59,396
 that I may receive this great joy

89
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:06,966
16 But Aaron said unto him: If thou desirest this

90
00:10:06,966 --> 00:10:14,466
 thing, if thou wilt bow down before God, yea, if

91
00:10:14,466 --> 00:10:21,966
 thou wilt repent of all thy sins, and will bow down

92
00:10:21,966 --> 00:10:29,466
 before God, and call on his name in faith,

93
00:10:29,466 --> 00:10:36,966
 believing that ye shall receive, then shalt thou receive

94
00:10:36,966 --> 00:10:44,466
 the hope which thou desirest

95
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:51,394
17 And it came to pass that when Aaron had said

96
00:10:51,394 --> 00:10:58,644
 these words, the king did bow down before the Lord,

97
00:10:58,644 --> 00:11:05,894
 upon his knees; yea, even he did prostrate himself

98
00:11:05,894 --> 00:11:13,144
 upon the earth, and cried mightily, saying

99
00:11:13,64 --> 00:11:20,497
18 O God, Aaron hath told me that there is a God;

100
00:11:20,497 --> 00:11:27,354
 and if there is a God, and if thou art God, wilt

101
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:34,211
 thou make thyself known unto me, and I will give

102
00:11:34,211 --> 00:11:41,068
 away all my sins to know thee, and that I may be

103
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:47,925
 raised from the dead, and be saved at the last day.

104
00:11:47,925 --> 00:11:54,782
 And now when the king had said these words, he was

105
00:11:54,782 --> 00:12:01,639
 struck as if he were dead

106
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:48,83
19 And it came to pass that his servants ran and

107
00:12:48,83 --> 00:13:35,705
 told the queen all that had happened unto the king.

108
00:13:35,705 --> 00:14:22,58
 And she came in unto the king; and when she saw

109
00:14:22,58 --> 00:15:09,455
 him lay as if he were dead, and also Aaron and his

110
00:15:09,455 --> 00:15:56,33
 brethren standing as though they had been the

111
00:15:56,33 --> 00:16:43,205
 cause of his fall, she was angry with them, and

112
00:16:43,205 --> 00:17:30,08
 commanded that her servants, or the servants of the

113
00:17:30,08 --> 00:18:16,955
 king, should take them and slay them

114
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:31,619
20 Now the servants had seen the cause of the

115
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:46,476
 king’s fall, therefore they durst not lay their hands

116
00:18:46,476 --> 00:19:01,333
 on Aaron and his brethren; and they pled with the

117
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:16,19
 queen saying: Why commandest thou that we should

118
00:19:16,19 --> 00:19:31,047
 slay these men, when behold one of them is mightier

119
00:19:31,047 --> 00:19:45,904
 than us all? Therefore we shall fall before them

120
00:19:45,904 --> 00:20:00,761


121
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:13,233
21 Now when the queen saw the fear of the servants

122
00:20:13,233 --> 00:20:26,033
 she also began to fear exceedingly, lest there

123
00:20:26,033 --> 00:20:38,833
 should some evil come upon her. And she commanded

124
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:51,633
 her servants that they should go and call the

125
00:20:51,633 --> 00:21:04,433
 people, that they might slay Aaron and his brethren

126
00:21:04,23 --> 00:21:05,23
22 Now when Aaron saw the determination of the

127
00:21:05,23 --> 00:21:06,23
 queen, he, also knowing the hardness of the hearts of

128
00:21:06,23 --> 00:21:07,23
 the people, feared lest that a multitude should

129
00:21:07,23 --> 00:21:08,23
 assemble themselves together, and there should be a

130
00:21:08,23 --> 00:21:09,23
 great contention and a disturbance among them;

131
00:21:09,23 --> 00:21:10,23
 therefore he put forth his hand and raised the king

132
00:21:10,23 --> 00:21:11,23
 from the earth, and said unto him: Stand. And he

133
00:21:11,23 --> 00:21:12,23
 stood upon his feet, receiving his strength

134
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:24,037
23 Now this was done in the presence of the queen

135
00:21:24,037 --> 00:21:35,87
 and many of the servants. And when they saw it

136
00:21:35,87 --> 00:21:47,703
 they greatly marveled, and began to fear. And the

137
00:21:47,703 --> 00:21:59,536
 king stood forth, and began to minister unto them.

138
00:21:59,536 --> 00:22:11,369
 And he did minister unto them, insomuch that his

139
00:22:11,369 --> 00:22:23,202
 whole household were converted unto the Lord

140
00:22:23,976 --> 00:22:31,976
24 Now there was a multitude gathered together

141
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:39,976
 because of the commandment of the queen, and there

142
00:22:39,976 --> 00:22:47,976
 began to be great murmurings among them because of

143
00:22:47,976 --> 00:22:55,976
 Aaron and his brethren

144
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,542
25 But the king stood forth among them and

145
00:22:58,542 --> 00:23:01,209
 administered unto them. And they were pacified towards

146
00:23:01,209 --> 00:23:03,876
 Aaron and those who were with him

147
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:12,772
28 Now, the more idle part of the Lamanites lived

148
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:13,772
 in the wilderness, and dwelt in tents; and they

149
00:01:13,772 --> 00:01:14,772
 were spread through the wilderness on the west, in

150
00:01:14,772 --> 00:01:15,772
 the land of Nephi; yea, and also on the west of the

151
00:01:15,772 --> 00:01:16,772
 land of Zarahemla, in the borders by the

152
00:01:16,772 --> 00:01:17,772
 seashore, and on the west in the land of Nephi, in the

153
00:01:17,772 --> 00:01:18,772
 place of their fathers’ first inheritance, and thus

154
00:01:18,772 --> 00:01:19,772
 bordering along by the seashore

155
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,346
29 And also there were many Lamanites on the east

156
00:01:21,346 --> 00:01:22,946
 by the seashore, whither the Nephites had driven

157
00:01:22,946 --> 00:01:24,546
 them. And thus the Nephites were nearly surrounded

158
00:01:24,546 --> 00:01:26,146
 by the Lamanites; nevertheless the Nephites had

159
00:01:26,146 --> 00:01:27,746
 taken possession of all the northern parts of the

160
00:01:27,746 --> 00:01:29,346
 land bordering on the wilderness, at the head of the

161
00:01:29,346 --> 00:01:30,946
 river Sidon, from the east to the west, round

162
00:01:30,946 --> 00:01:32,546
 about on the wilderness side; on the north, even

163
00:01:32,546 --> 00:01:34,146
 until they came to the land which they called

164
00:01:34,146 --> 00:01:35,746
 Bountiful

165
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:54,363
30 And it bordered upon the land which they called

166
00:01:54,363 --> 00:02:13,03
 Desolation, it being so far northward that it

167
00:02:13,03 --> 00:02:31,697
 came into the land which had been peopled and been

168
00:02:31,697 --> 00:02:50,364
 destroyed, of whose bones we have spoken, which was

169
00:02:50,364 --> 00:03:09,031
 discovered by the people of Zarahemla, it being

170
00:03:09,031 --> 00:03:27,698
 the place of their first landing

171
00:03:27,34 --> 00:03:34,197
31 And they came from there up into the south

172
00:03:34,197 --> 00:03:41,054
 wilderness. Thus the land on the northward was called

173
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:47,911
 Desolation, and the land on the southward was

174
00:03:47,911 --> 00:03:54,768
 called Bountiful, it being the wilderness which is

175
00:03:54,768 --> 00:04:01,625
 filled with all manner of wild animals of every kind,

176
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:08,482
 a part of which had come from the land northward

177
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:15,339
 for food

178
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,331
32 And now, it was only the distance of a day and

179
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:17,474
 a half’s journey for a Nephite, on the line

180
00:04:17,474 --> 00:04:18,617
 Bountiful and the land Desolation, from the east to the

181
00:04:18,617 --> 00:04:19,76
 west sea; and thus the land of Nephi and the land

182
00:04:19,76 --> 00:04:20,903
 of Zarahemla were nearly surrounded by water,

183
00:04:20,903 --> 00:04:22,046
 there being a small neck of land between the land

184
00:04:22,046 --> 00:04:23,189
 northward and the land southward

185
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:25,449
33 And it came to pass that the Nephites had

186
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:27,735
 inhabited the land Bountiful, even from the east unto

187
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:30,021
 the west sea, and thus the Nephites in their

188
00:04:30,021 --> 00:04:32,307
 wisdom, with their guards and their armies, had hemmed

189
00:04:32,307 --> 00:04:34,593
 in the Lamanites on the south, that thereby they

190
00:04:34,593 --> 00:04:36,879
 should have no more possession on the north, that

191
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:39,165
 they might not overrun the land northward

192
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:51,541
34 Therefore the Lamanites could have no more

193
00:04:51,541 --> 00:05:03,97
 possessions only in the land of Nephi, and the

194
00:05:03,97 --> 00:05:16,399
 wilderness round about. Now this was wisdom in the

195
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:28,828
 Nephites—as the Lamanites were an enemy to them, they

196
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:41,257
 would not suffer their afflictions on every hand,

197
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:53,686
 and also that they might have a country whither they

198
00:05:53,686 --> 00:06:06,115
 might flee, according to their desires

199
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:07,166
35 And now I, after having said this, return again

200
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:07,499
 to the account of Ammon and Aaron, Omner and

201
00:06:07,499 --> 00:06:07,832
 Himni, and their brethren.
