00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:23,0
Chapter 30 Korihor, the anti-Christ, ridicules

2
00:00:23,0 --> 00:00:46,0
 Christ, the Atonement, and the spirit of prophecy—He

3
00:00:46,0 --> 00:01:09,0
 teaches that there is no God, no fall of man, no

4
00:01:09,0 --> 00:01:32,0
 penalty for sin, and no Christ—Alma testifies that

5
00:01:32,0 --> 00:01:55,0
 Christ will come and that all things denote there

6
00:01:55,0 --> 00:02:18,0
 is a God—Korihor demands a sign and is struck

7
00:02:18,0 --> 00:02:41,0
 dumb—The devil had appeared to Korihor as an angel and

8
00:02:41,0 --> 00:03:04,0
 taught him what to say—Korihor is trodden down

9
00:03:04,0 --> 00:03:27,0
 and dies. About 76–74 B.C.

10
00:03:27,34 --> 00:03:41,74
1 Behold, now it came to pass that after the

11
00:03:41,74 --> 00:03:56,14
 people of Ammon were established in the land of

12
00:03:56,14 --> 00:04:10,54
 Jershon, yea, and also after the Lamanites were driven

13
00:04:10,54 --> 00:04:24,94
 out of the land, and their dead were buried by the

14
00:04:24,94 --> 00:04:39,34
 people of the land

15
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,112
2 Now their dead were not numbered because of the

16
00:04:40,112 --> 00:04:41,112
 greatness of their numbers; neither were the dead

17
00:04:41,112 --> 00:04:42,112
 of the Nephites numbered—but it came to pass after

18
00:04:42,112 --> 00:04:43,112
 they had buried their dead, and also after the

19
00:04:43,112 --> 00:04:44,112
 days of fasting, and mourning, and prayer, (and it

20
00:04:44,112 --> 00:04:45,112
 was in the sixteenth year of the reign of the

21
00:04:45,112 --> 00:04:46,112
 judges over the people of Nephi) there began to be

22
00:04:46,112 --> 00:04:47,112
 continual peace throughout all the land

23
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:59,687
3 Yea, and the people did observe to keep the

24
00:04:59,687 --> 00:05:12,287
 commandments of the Lord; and they were strict in

25
00:05:12,287 --> 00:05:24,887
 observing the ordinances of God, according to the law

26
00:05:24,887 --> 00:05:37,487
 of Moses; for they were taught to keep the law of

27
00:05:37,487 --> 00:05:50,087
 Moses until it should be fulfilled

28
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:56,217
4 And thus the people did have no disturbance in

29
00:05:56,217 --> 00:06:01,55
 all the sixteenth year of the reign of the judges

30
00:06:01,55 --> 00:06:06,883
 over the people of Nephi

31
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:12,166
5 And it came to pass that in the commencement of

32
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:17,499
 the seventeenth year of the reign of the judges,

33
00:06:17,499 --> 00:06:22,832
 there was continual peace

34
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,115
6 But it came to pass in the latter end of the

35
00:06:24,115 --> 00:06:25,448
 seventeenth year, there came a man into the land of

36
00:06:25,448 --> 00:06:26,781
 Zarahemla, and he was Anti-Christ, for he began to

37
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:28,114
 preach unto the people against the prophecies

38
00:06:28,114 --> 00:06:29,447
 which had been spoken by the prophets, concerning the

39
00:06:29,447 --> 00:06:30,78
 coming of Christ

40
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:48,757
7 Now there was no law against a man’s belief; for

41
00:06:48,757 --> 00:07:06,757
 it was strictly contrary to the commands of God

42
00:07:06,757 --> 00:07:24,757
 that there should be a law which should bring men

43
00:07:24,757 --> 00:07:42,757
 on to unequal grounds

44
00:07:42,529 --> 00:08:10,529
8 For thus saith the scripture: Choose ye this

45
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:38,529
 day, whom ye will serve

46
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:44,351
9 Now if a man desired to serve God, it was his

47
00:08:44,351 --> 00:08:50,351
 privilege; or rather, if he believed in God it was

48
00:08:50,351 --> 00:08:56,351
 his privilege to serve him; but if he did not

49
00:08:56,351 --> 00:09:02,351
 believe in him there was no law to punish him

50
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:10,275
10 But if he murdered he was punished unto death;

51
00:09:10,275 --> 00:09:18,275
 and if he robbed he was also punished; and if he

52
00:09:18,275 --> 00:09:26,275
 stole he was also punished; and if he committed

53
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:34,275
 adultery he was also punished; yea, for all this

54
00:09:34,275 --> 00:09:42,275
 wickedness they were punished

55
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:46,948
11 For there was a law that men should be judged

56
00:09:46,948 --> 00:09:51,748
 according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there was

57
00:09:51,748 --> 00:09:56,548
 no law against a man’s belief; therefore, a man

58
00:09:56,548 --> 00:10:01,348
 was punished only for the crimes which he had done;

59
00:10:01,348 --> 00:10:06,148
 therefore all men were on equal grounds

60
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:10,072
12 And this Anti-Christ, whose name was Korihor,

61
00:10:10,072 --> 00:10:14,072
 (and the law could have no hold upon him) began to

62
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:18,072
 preach unto the people that there should be no

63
00:10:18,072 --> 00:10:22,072
 Christ. And after this manner did he preach, saying

64
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,771
13 O ye that are bound down under a foolish and a

65
00:10:23,771 --> 00:10:25,521
 vain hope, why do ye yoke yourselves with such

66
00:10:25,521 --> 00:10:27,271
 foolish things? Why do ye look for a Christ? For no

67
00:10:27,271 --> 00:10:29,021
 man can know of anything which is to come

68
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:32,663
14 Behold, these things which ye call prophecies,

69
00:10:32,663 --> 00:10:35,33
 which ye say are handed down by holy prophets,

70
00:10:35,33 --> 00:10:37,997
 behold, they are foolish traditions of your fathers

71
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:59,304
15 How do ye know of their surety? Behold, ye

72
00:10:59,304 --> 00:11:20,637
 cannot know of things which ye do not see; therefore

73
00:11:20,637 --> 00:11:41,97
 ye cannot know that there shall be a Christ

74
00:11:41,768 --> 00:12:28,268
16 Ye look forward and say that ye see a remission

75
00:12:28,268 --> 00:13:14,768
 of your sins. But behold, it is the effect of a

76
00:13:14,768 --> 00:14:01,268
 frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds

77
00:14:01,268 --> 00:14:47,768
 comes because of the traditions of your fathers,

78
00:14:47,768 --> 00:15:34,268
 which lead you away into a belief of things which

79
00:15:34,268 --> 00:16:20,768
 are not so

80
00:16:20,88 --> 00:16:35,88
17 And many more such things did he say unto them,

81
00:16:35,88 --> 00:16:50,88
 telling them that there could be no atonement

82
00:16:50,88 --> 00:17:05,88
 made for the sins of men, but every man fared in this

83
00:17:05,88 --> 00:17:20,88
 life according to the management of the creature;

84
00:17:20,88 --> 00:17:35,88
 therefore every man prospered according to his

85
00:17:35,88 --> 00:17:50,88
 genius, and that every man conquered according to

86
00:17:50,88 --> 00:18:05,88
 his strength; and whatsoever a man did was no crime

87
00:18:05,88 --> 00:18:20,88


88
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:36,499
18 And thus he did preach unto them, leading away

89
00:18:36,499 --> 00:18:52,499
 the hearts of many, causing them to lift up their

90
00:18:52,499 --> 00:19:08,499
 heads in their wickedness, yea, leading away many

91
00:19:08,499 --> 00:19:24,499
 women, and also men, to commit whoredoms—telling

92
00:19:24,499 --> 00:19:40,499
 them that when a man was dead, that was the end

93
00:19:40,499 --> 00:19:56,499
 thereof

94
00:19:56,195 --> 00:20:09,528
19 Now this man went over to the land of Jershon

95
00:20:09,528 --> 00:20:22,861
 also, to preach these things among the people of

96
00:20:22,861 --> 00:20:36,194
 Ammon, who were once the people of the Lamanites

97
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:47,818
20 But behold they were more wise than many of the

98
00:20:47,818 --> 00:20:59,568
 Nephites; for they took him, and bound him, and

99
00:20:59,568 --> 00:21:11,318
 carried him before Ammon, who was a high priest

100
00:21:11,318 --> 00:21:23,068
 over that people

101
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:37,63
21 And it came to pass that he caused that he

102
00:21:37,63 --> 00:21:51,344
 should be carried out of the land. And he came over

103
00:21:51,344 --> 00:22:05,058
 into the land of Gideon, and began to preach unto

104
00:22:05,058 --> 00:22:18,772
 them also; and here he did not have much success,

105
00:22:18,772 --> 00:22:32,486
 for he was taken and bound and carried before the

106
00:22:32,486 --> 00:22:46,2
 high priest, and also the chief judge over the land

107
00:22:46,2 --> 00:22:59,914


108
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:02,279
22 And it came to pass that the high priest said

109
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:04,946
 unto him: Why do ye go about perverting the ways of

110
00:23:04,946 --> 00:23:07,613
 the Lord? Why do ye teach this people that there

111
00:23:07,613 --> 00:23:10,28
 shall be no Christ, to interrupt their rejoicings?

112
00:23:10,28 --> 00:23:12,947
 Why do ye speak against all the prophecies of the

113
00:23:12,947 --> 00:23:15,614
 holy prophets

114
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:19,117
23 Now the high priest’s name was Giddonah. And

115
00:23:19,117 --> 00:23:22,673
 Korihor said unto him: Because I do not teach the

116
00:23:22,673 --> 00:23:26,229
 foolish traditions of your fathers, and because I do

117
00:23:26,229 --> 00:23:29,785
 not teach this people to bind themselves down

118
00:23:29,785 --> 00:23:33,341
 under the foolish ordinances and performances which

119
00:23:33,341 --> 00:23:36,897
 are laid down by ancient priests, to usurp power

120
00:23:36,897 --> 00:23:40,453
 and authority over them, to keep them in ignorance,

121
00:23:40,453 --> 00:23:44,009
 that they may not lift up their heads, but be

122
00:23:44,009 --> 00:23:47,565
 brought down according to thy words

123
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:55,459
24 Ye say that this people is a free people.

124
00:23:55,459 --> 00:24:03,459
 Behold, I say they are in bondage. Ye say that those

125
00:24:03,459 --> 00:24:11,459
 ancient prophecies are true. Behold, I say that ye

126
00:24:11,459 --> 00:24:19,459
 do not know that they are true

127
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:35,358
25 Ye say that this people is a guilty and a

128
00:24:35,358 --> 00:24:51,358
 fallen people, because of the transgression of a

129
00:24:51,358 --> 00:25:07,358
 parent. Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because

130
00:25:07,358 --> 00:25:23,358
 of its parents

131
00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:35,155
26 And ye also say that Christ shall come. But

132
00:25:35,155 --> 00:25:47,155
 behold, I say that ye do not know that there shall be

133
00:25:47,155 --> 00:25:59,155
 a Christ. And ye say also that he shall be slain

134
00:25:59,155 --> 00:26:11,155
 for the sins of the world

135
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:20,003
27 And thus ye lead away this people after the

136
00:26:20,003 --> 00:26:29,003
 foolish traditions of your fathers, and according to

137
00:26:29,003 --> 00:26:38,003
 your own desires; and ye keep them down, even as

138
00:26:38,003 --> 00:26:47,003
 it were in bondage, that ye may glut yourselves

139
00:26:47,003 --> 00:26:56,003
 with the labors of their hands, that they durst not

140
00:26:56,003 --> 00:27:05,003
 look up with boldness, and that they durst not

141
00:27:05,003 --> 00:27:14,003
 enjoy their rights and privileges

142
00:27:14,8 --> 00:27:16,4
28 Yea, they durst not make use of that which is

143
00:27:16,4 --> 00:27:17,0
 their own lest they should offend their priests,

144
00:27:17,0 --> 00:27:19,6
 who do yoke them according to their desires, and

145
00:27:19,6 --> 00:27:21,2
 have brought them to believe, by their traditions and

146
00:27:21,2 --> 00:27:22,8
 their dreams and their whims and their visions

147
00:27:22,8 --> 00:27:24,4
 and their pretended mysteries, that they should, if

148
00:27:24,4 --> 00:27:25,0
 they did not do according to their words, offend

149
00:27:25,0 --> 00:27:27,6
 some unknown being, who they say is God—a being who

150
00:27:27,6 --> 00:27:29,2
 never has been seen or known, who never was nor

151
00:27:29,2 --> 00:27:30,8
 ever will be

152
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:31,638
29 Now when the high priest and the chief judge

153
00:27:31,638 --> 00:27:32,527
 saw the hardness of his heart, yea, when they saw

154
00:27:32,527 --> 00:27:33,416
 that he would revile even against God, they would

155
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:34,305
 not make any reply to his words; but they caused

156
00:27:34,305 --> 00:27:35,194
 that he should be bound; and they delivered him up

157
00:27:35,194 --> 00:27:36,083
 into the hands of the officers, and sent him to the

158
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:36,972
 land of Zarahemla, that he might be brought before

159
00:27:36,972 --> 00:27:37,861
 Alma, and the chief judge who was governor over

160
00:27:37,861 --> 00:27:38,75
 all the land

161
00:27:38,724 --> 00:27:50,724
30 And it came to pass that when he was brought

162
00:27:50,724 --> 00:28:02,724
 before Alma and the chief judge, he did go on in the

163
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:14,724
 same manner as he did in the land of Gideon; yea,

164
00:28:14,724 --> 00:28:26,724
 he went on to blaspheme

165
00:28:26,572 --> 00:28:45,772
31 And he did rise up in great swelling words

166
00:28:45,772 --> 00:29:04,972
 before Alma, and did revile against the priests and

167
00:29:04,972 --> 00:29:24,172
 teachers, accusing them of leading away the people

168
00:29:24,172 --> 00:29:43,372
 after the silly traditions of their fathers, for

169
00:29:43,372 --> 00:30:02,572
 the sake of glutting on the labors of the people

170
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:06,838
32 Now Alma said unto him: Thou knowest that we do

171
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:11,409
 not glut ourselves upon the labors of this

172
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:15,98
 people; for behold I have labored even from the

173
00:30:15,98 --> 00:30:20,551
 commencement of the reign of the judges until now, with

174
00:30:20,551 --> 00:30:25,122
 mine own hands for my support, notwithstanding my

175
00:30:25,122 --> 00:30:29,693
 many travels round about the land to declare the

176
00:30:29,693 --> 00:30:34,264
 word of God unto my people

177
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:45,999
33 And notwithstanding the many labors which I

178
00:30:45,999 --> 00:30:57,832
 have performed in the church, I have never received

179
00:30:57,832 --> 00:31:09,665
 so much as even one senine for my labor; neither

180
00:31:09,665 --> 00:31:21,498
 has any of my brethren, save it were in the

181
00:31:21,498 --> 00:31:33,331
 judgment-seat; and then we have received only according to

182
00:31:33,331 --> 00:31:45,164
 law for our time

183
00:03:27,34 --> 00:04:39,34
36 And Korihor answered him, Yea

184
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:43,112
37 And then Alma said unto him: Believest thou

185
00:04:43,112 --> 00:04:47,112
 that there is a God

186
00:04:47,087 --> 00:05:50,087
38 And he answered, Nay

187
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:54,884
39 Now Alma said unto him: Will ye deny again that

188
00:05:54,884 --> 00:05:58,884
 there is a God, and also deny the Christ? For

189
00:05:58,884 --> 00:06:02,884
 behold, I say unto you, I know there is a God, and

190
00:06:02,884 --> 00:06:06,884
 also that Christ shall come

191
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:12,166
40 And now what evidence have ye that there is no

192
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:17,499
 God, or that Christ cometh not? I say unto you

193
00:06:17,499 --> 00:06:22,832
 that ye have none, save it be your word only

194
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,382
41 But, behold, I have all things as a testimony

195
00:06:24,382 --> 00:06:25,982
 that these things are true; and ye also have all

196
00:06:25,982 --> 00:06:27,582
 things as a testimony unto you that they are true;

197
00:06:27,582 --> 00:06:29,182
 and will ye deny them? Believest thou that these

198
00:06:29,182 --> 00:06:30,782
 things are true

199
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:42,757
42 Behold, I know that thou believest, but thou

200
00:06:42,757 --> 00:06:54,757
 art possessed with a lying spirit, and ye have put

201
00:06:54,757 --> 00:07:06,757
 off the Spirit of God that it may have no place in

202
00:07:06,757 --> 00:07:18,757
 you; but the devil has power over you, and he doth

203
00:07:18,757 --> 00:07:30,757
 carry you about, working devices that he may

204
00:07:30,757 --> 00:07:42,757
 destroy the children of God

205
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:53,729
43 And now Korihor said unto Alma: If thou wilt

206
00:07:53,729 --> 00:08:04,929
 show me a sign, that I may be convinced that there

207
00:08:04,929 --> 00:08:16,129
 is a God, yea, show unto me that he hath power, and

208
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:27,329
 then will I be convinced of the truth of thy

209
00:08:27,329 --> 00:08:38,529
 words

210
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,751
44 But Alma said unto him: Thou hast had signs

211
00:08:40,751 --> 00:08:43,151
 enough; will ye tempt your God? Will ye say, Show

212
00:08:43,151 --> 00:08:45,551
 unto me a sign, when ye have the testimony of all

213
00:08:45,551 --> 00:08:47,951
 these thy brethren, and also all the holy prophets?

214
00:08:47,951 --> 00:08:50,351
 The scriptures are laid before thee, yea, and all

215
00:08:50,351 --> 00:08:52,751
 things denote there is a God; yea, even the earth,

216
00:08:52,751 --> 00:08:55,151
 and all things that are upon the face of it, yea,

217
00:08:55,151 --> 00:08:57,551
 and its motion, yea, and also all the planets

218
00:08:57,551 --> 00:08:59,951
 which move in their regular form do witness that there

219
00:08:59,951 --> 00:09:02,351
 is a Supreme Creator

220
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:10,275
45 And yet do ye go about, leading away the hearts

221
00:09:10,275 --> 00:09:18,275
 of this people, testifying unto them there is no

222
00:09:18,275 --> 00:09:26,275
 God? And yet will ye deny against all these

223
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:34,275
 witnesses? And he said: Yea, I will deny, except ye

224
00:09:34,275 --> 00:09:42,275
 shall show me a sign

225
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:48,148
46 And now it came to pass that Alma said unto

226
00:09:48,148 --> 00:09:54,148
 him: Behold, I am grieved because of the hardness of

227
00:09:54,148 --> 00:10:00,148
 your heart, yea, that ye will still resist the

228
00:10:00,148 --> 00:10:06,148
 spirit of the truth, that thy soul may be destroyed

229
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,072
47 But behold, it is better that thy soul should

230
00:10:08,072 --> 00:10:10,072
 be lost than that thou shouldst be the means of

231
00:10:10,072 --> 00:10:12,072
 bringing many souls down to destruction, by thy lying

232
00:10:12,072 --> 00:10:14,072
 and by thy flattering words; therefore if thou

233
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,072
 shalt deny again, behold God shall smite thee, that

234
00:10:16,072 --> 00:10:18,072
 thou shalt become dumb, that thou shalt never open

235
00:10:18,072 --> 00:10:20,072
 thy mouth any more, that thou shalt not deceive

236
00:10:20,072 --> 00:10:22,072
 this people any more

237
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,421
48 Now Korihor said unto him: I do not deny the

238
00:10:23,421 --> 00:10:24,821
 existence of a God, but I do not believe that there

239
00:10:24,821 --> 00:10:26,221
 is a God; and I say also, that ye do not know that

240
00:10:26,221 --> 00:10:27,621
 there is a God; and except ye show me a sign, I

241
00:10:27,621 --> 00:10:29,021
 will not believe

242
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,596
49 Now Alma said unto him: This will I give unto

243
00:10:31,596 --> 00:10:33,196
 thee for a sign, that thou shalt be struck dumb,

244
00:10:33,196 --> 00:10:34,796
 according to my words; and I say, that in the name

245
00:10:34,796 --> 00:10:36,396
 of God, ye shall be struck dumb, that ye shall no

246
00:10:36,396 --> 00:10:37,996
 more have utterance

247
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:59,304
50 Now when Alma had said these words, Korihor was

248
00:10:59,304 --> 00:11:20,637
 struck dumb, that he could not have utterance,

249
00:11:20,637 --> 00:11:41,97
 according to the words of Alma

250
00:11:41,768 --> 00:12:21,625
51 And now when the chief judge saw this, he put

251
00:12:21,625 --> 00:13:01,482
 forth his hand and wrote unto Korihor, saying: Art

252
00:13:01,482 --> 00:13:41,339
 thou convinced of the power of God? In whom did ye

253
00:13:41,339 --> 00:14:21,196
 desire that Alma should show forth his sign?

254
00:14:21,196 --> 00:15:01,053
 Would ye that he should afflict others, to show unto

255
00:15:01,053 --> 00:15:40,91
 thee a sign? Behold, he has showed unto you a sign;

256
00:15:40,91 --> 00:16:20,767
 and now will ye dispute more

257
00:16:20,88 --> 00:16:44,88
52 And Korihor put forth his hand and wrote,

258
00:16:44,88 --> 00:17:08,88
 saying: I know that I am dumb, for I cannot speak; and

259
00:17:08,88 --> 00:17:32,88
 I know that nothing save it were the power of God

260
00:17:32,88 --> 00:17:56,88
 could bring this upon me; yea, and I always knew

261
00:17:56,88 --> 00:18:20,88
 that there was a God

262
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:28,499
53 But behold, the devil hath deceived me; for he

263
00:18:28,499 --> 00:18:36,499
 appeared unto me in the form of an angel, and said

264
00:18:36,499 --> 00:18:44,499
 unto me: Go and reclaim this people, for they

265
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:52,499
 have all gone astray after an unknown God. And he

266
00:18:52,499 --> 00:19:00,499
 said unto me: There is no God; yea, and he taught me

267
00:19:00,499 --> 00:19:08,499
 that which I should say. And I have taught his

268
00:19:08,499 --> 00:19:16,499
 words; and I taught them because they were pleasing

269
00:19:16,499 --> 00:19:24,499
 unto the carnal mind; and I taught them, even until

270
00:19:24,499 --> 00:19:32,499
 I had much success, insomuch that I verily

271
00:19:32,499 --> 00:19:40,499
 believed that they were true; and for this cause I

272
00:19:40,499 --> 00:19:48,499
 withstood the truth, even until I have brought this

273
00:19:48,499 --> 00:19:56,499
 great curse upon me

274
00:19:56,195 --> 00:20:09,528
54 Now when he had said this, he besought that

275
00:20:09,528 --> 00:20:22,861
 Alma should pray unto God, that the curse might be

276
00:20:22,861 --> 00:20:36,194
 taken from him

277
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:47,818
55 But Alma said unto him: If this curse should be

278
00:20:47,818 --> 00:20:59,568
 taken from thee thou wouldst again lead away the

279
00:20:59,568 --> 00:21:11,318
 hearts of this people; therefore, it shall be unto

280
00:21:11,318 --> 00:21:23,068
 thee even as the Lord will

281
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:55,916
56 And it came to pass that the curse was not

282
00:21:55,916 --> 00:22:27,916
 taken off of Korihor; but he was cast out, and went

283
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:59,916
 about from house to house begging for his food

284
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:01,898
57 Now the knowledge of what had happened unto

285
00:23:01,898 --> 00:23:04,184
 Korihor was immediately published throughout all the

286
00:23:04,184 --> 00:23:06,47
 land; yea, the proclamation was sent forth by the

287
00:23:06,47 --> 00:23:08,756
 chief judge to all the people in the land,

288
00:23:08,756 --> 00:23:11,042
 declaring unto those who had believed in the words of

289
00:23:11,042 --> 00:23:13,328
 Korihor that they must speedily repent, lest the same

290
00:23:13,328 --> 00:23:15,614
 judgments would come unto them

291
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:20,894
58 And it came to pass that they were all

292
00:23:20,894 --> 00:23:26,227
 convinced of the wickedness of Korihor; therefore they

293
00:23:26,227 --> 00:23:31,56
 were all converted again unto the Lord; and this put

294
00:23:31,56 --> 00:23:36,893
 an end to the iniquity after the manner of

295
00:23:36,893 --> 00:23:42,226
 Korihor. And Korihor did go about from house to house,

296
00:23:42,226 --> 00:23:47,559
 begging food for his support

297
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:52,03
59 And it came to pass that as he went forth among

298
00:23:52,03 --> 00:23:56,601
 the people, yea, among a people who had separated

299
00:23:56,601 --> 00:24:01,172
 themselves from the Nephites and called

300
00:24:01,172 --> 00:24:05,743
 themselves Zoramites, being led by a man whose name was

301
00:24:05,743 --> 00:24:10,314
 Zoram—and as he went forth amongst them, behold, he

302
00:24:10,314 --> 00:24:14,885
 was run upon and trodden down, even until he was

303
00:24:14,885 --> 00:24:19,456
 dead

304
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:19,358
60 And thus we see the end of him who perverteth

305
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:19,358
 the ways of the Lord; and thus we see that the

306
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:19,358
 devil will not support his children at the last day,

307
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:19,358
 but doth speedily drag them down to hell.
