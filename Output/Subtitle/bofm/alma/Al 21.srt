00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:09,333
An account of the preaching of Aaron, and Muloki,

2
00:00:09,333 --> 00:00:18,666
 and their brethren, to the Lamanites. Comprising

3
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:27,999
 chapters 21 through 25.Chapter 21 Aaron teaches the

4
00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:37,332
 Amalekites about Christ and His Atonement—Aaron

5
00:00:37,332 --> 00:00:46,665
 and his brethren are imprisoned in Middoni—After

6
00:00:46,665 --> 00:00:55,998
 their deliverance, they teach in the synagogues and

7
00:00:55,998 --> 00:01:05,331
 make many converts—Lamoni grants religious freedom

8
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:14,664
 to the people in the land of Ishmael. About

9
00:01:14,664 --> 00:01:23,997
 90–77 B.C.

10
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:31,618
1 Now when Ammon and his brethren separated

11
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:38,785
 themselves in the borders of the land of the Lamanites,

12
00:01:38,785 --> 00:01:45,952
 behold Aaron took his journey towards the land

13
00:01:45,952 --> 00:01:53,119
 which was called by the Lamanites, Jerusalem, calling

14
00:01:53,119 --> 00:02:00,286
 it after the land of their fathers’ nativity; and

15
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:07,453
 it was away joining the borders of Mormon

16
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:13,361
2 Now the Lamanites and the Amalekites and the

17
00:02:13,361 --> 00:02:19,361
 people of Amulon had built a great city, which was

18
00:02:19,361 --> 00:02:25,361
 called Jerusalem

19
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:31,146
3 Now the Lamanites of themselves were

20
00:02:31,146 --> 00:02:36,813
 sufficiently hardened, but the Amalekites and the Amulonites

21
00:02:36,813 --> 00:02:42,48
 were still harder; therefore they did cause the

22
00:02:42,48 --> 00:02:48,147
 Lamanites that they should harden their hearts, that

23
00:02:48,147 --> 00:02:53,814
 they should wax strong in wickedness and their

24
00:02:53,814 --> 00:02:59,481
 abominations

25
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:06,089
4 And it came to pass that Aaron came to the city

26
00:03:06,089 --> 00:03:12,232
 of Jerusalem, and first began to preach to the

27
00:03:12,232 --> 00:03:18,375
 Amalekites. And he began to preach to them in their

28
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:24,518
 synagogues, for they had built synagogues after the

29
00:03:24,518 --> 00:03:30,661
 order of the Nehors; for many of the Amalekites

30
00:03:30,661 --> 00:03:36,804
 and the Amulonites were after the order of the

31
00:03:36,804 --> 00:03:42,947
 Nehors

32
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:49,923
5 Therefore, as Aaron entered into one of their

33
00:03:49,923 --> 00:03:56,923
 synagogues to preach unto the people, and as he was

34
00:03:56,923 --> 00:04:03,923
 speaking unto them, behold there arose an

35
00:04:03,923 --> 00:04:10,923
 Amalekite and began to contend with him, saying: What is

36
00:04:10,923 --> 00:04:17,923
 that thou hast testified? Hast thou seen an angel?

37
00:04:17,923 --> 00:04:24,923
 Why do not angels appear unto us? Behold are not

38
00:04:24,923 --> 00:04:31,923
 this people as good as thy people

39
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:38,352
6 Thou also sayest, except we repent we shall

40
00:04:38,352 --> 00:04:45,066
 perish. How knowest thou the thought and intent of our

41
00:04:45,066 --> 00:04:51,78
 hearts? How knowest thou that we have cause to

42
00:04:51,78 --> 00:04:58,494
 repent? How knowest thou that we are not a righteous

43
00:04:58,494 --> 00:05:05,208
 people? Behold, we have built sanctuaries, and we

44
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:11,922
 do assemble ourselves together to worship God. We

45
00:05:11,922 --> 00:05:18,636
 do believe that God will save all men

46
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:23,417
7 Now Aaron said unto him: Believest thou that the

47
00:05:23,417 --> 00:05:28,75
 Son of God shall come to redeem mankind from

48
00:05:28,75 --> 00:05:34,083
 their sins

49
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:39,277
8 And the man said unto him: We do not believe

50
00:05:39,277 --> 00:05:44,42
 that thou knowest any such thing. We do not believe

51
00:05:44,42 --> 00:05:49,563
 in these foolish traditions. We do not believe that

52
00:05:49,563 --> 00:05:54,706
 thou knowest of things to come, neither do we

53
00:05:54,706 --> 00:05:59,849
 believe that thy fathers and also that our fathers

54
00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:04,992
 did know concerning the things which they spake, of

55
00:06:04,992 --> 00:06:10,135
 that which is to come

56
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:15,637
9 Now Aaron began to open the scriptures unto them

57
00:06:15,637 --> 00:06:20,637
 concerning the coming of Christ, and also

58
00:06:20,637 --> 00:06:25,637
 concerning the resurrection of the dead, and that there

59
00:06:25,637 --> 00:06:30,637
 could be no redemption for mankind save it were

60
00:06:30,637 --> 00:06:35,637
 through the death and sufferings of Christ, and the

61
00:06:35,637 --> 00:06:40,637
 atonement of his blood

62
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:52,883
10 And it came to pass as he began to expound

63
00:06:52,883 --> 00:07:05,633
 these things unto them they were angry with him, and

64
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:18,383
 began to mock him; and they would not hear the

65
00:07:18,383 --> 00:07:31,133
 words which he spake

66
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:32,484
11 Therefore, when he saw that they would not hear

67
00:07:32,484 --> 00:07:33,817
 his words, he departed out of their synagogue,

68
00:07:33,817 --> 00:07:35,15
 and came over to a village which was called

69
00:07:35,15 --> 00:07:36,483
 Ani-Anti, and there he found Muloki preaching the word

70
00:07:36,483 --> 00:07:37,816
 unto them; and also Ammah and his brethren. And they

71
00:07:37,816 --> 00:07:39,149
 contended with many about the word

72
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:43,925
12 And it came to pass that they saw that the

73
00:07:43,925 --> 00:07:48,725
 people would harden their hearts, therefore they

74
00:07:48,725 --> 00:07:53,525
 departed and came over into the land of Middoni. And

75
00:07:53,525 --> 00:07:58,325
 they did preach the word unto many, and few believed

76
00:07:58,325 --> 00:08:03,125
 on the words which they taught

77
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:05,049
13 Nevertheless, Aaron and a certain number of his

78
00:08:05,049 --> 00:08:07,049
 brethren were taken and cast into prison, and the

79
00:08:07,049 --> 00:08:09,049
 remainder of them fled out of the land of Middoni

80
00:08:09,049 --> 00:08:11,049
 unto the regions round about

81
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:16,024
14 And those who were cast into prison suffered

82
00:08:16,024 --> 00:08:21,024
 many things, and they were delivered by the hand of

83
00:08:21,024 --> 00:08:26,024
 Lamoni and Ammon, and they were fed and clothed

84
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:29,64
15 And they went forth again to declare the word,

85
00:08:29,64 --> 00:08:32,307
 and thus they were delivered for the first time

86
00:08:32,307 --> 00:08:34,974
 out of prison; and thus they had suffered

87
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:42,948
16 And they went forth whithersoever they were led

88
00:08:42,948 --> 00:08:50,948
 by the Spirit of the Lord, preaching the word of

89
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:58,948
 God in every synagogue of the Amalekites, or in

90
00:08:58,948 --> 00:09:06,948
 every assembly of the Lamanites where they could be

91
00:09:06,948 --> 00:09:14,948
 admitted

92
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:21,221
17 And it came to pass that the Lord began to

93
00:09:21,221 --> 00:09:27,621
 bless them, insomuch that they brought many to the

94
00:09:27,621 --> 00:09:34,021
 knowledge of the truth; yea, they did convince many

95
00:09:34,021 --> 00:09:40,421
 of their sins, and of the traditions of their

96
00:09:40,421 --> 00:09:46,821
 fathers, which were not correct

97
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:57,719
18 And it came to pass that Ammon and Lamoni

98
00:09:57,719 --> 00:10:08,719
 returned from the land of Middoni to the land of

99
00:10:08,719 --> 00:10:19,719
 Ishmael, which was the land of their inheritance

100
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:24,352
19 And king Lamoni would not suffer that Ammon

101
00:10:24,352 --> 00:10:29,352
 should serve him, or be his servant

102
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:35,679
20 But he caused that there should be synagogues

103
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:41,929
 built in the land of Ishmael; and he caused that

104
00:10:41,929 --> 00:10:48,179
 his people, or the people who were under his reign,

105
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:54,429
 should assemble themselves together

106
00:10:54,487 --> 00:11:00,362
21 And he did rejoice over them, and he did teach

107
00:11:00,362 --> 00:11:06,237
 them many things. And he did also declare unto

108
00:11:06,237 --> 00:11:12,112
 them that they were a people who were under him, and

109
00:11:12,112 --> 00:11:17,987
 that they were a free people, that they were free

110
00:11:17,987 --> 00:11:23,862
 from the oppressions of the king, his father; for

111
00:11:23,862 --> 00:11:29,737
 that his father had granted unto him that he might

112
00:11:29,737 --> 00:11:35,612
 reign over the people who were in the land of

113
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:41,487
 Ishmael, and in all the land round about

114
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:47,367
22 And he also declared unto them that they might

115
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:53,367
 have the liberty of worshiping the Lord their God

116
00:11:53,367 --> 00:11:59,367
 according to their desires, in whatsoever place

117
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:05,367
 they were in, if it were in the land which was under

118
00:12:05,367 --> 00:12:11,367
 the reign of king Lamoni

119
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:12,741
23 And Ammon did preach unto the people of king

120
00:12:12,741 --> 00:12:13,884
 Lamoni; and it came to pass that he did teach them

121
00:12:13,884 --> 00:12:15,027
 all things concerning things pertaining to

122
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:16,17
 righteousness. And he did exhort them daily, with all

123
00:12:16,17 --> 00:12:17,313
 diligence; and they gave heed unto his word, and they

124
00:12:17,313 --> 00:12:18,456
 were zealous for keeping the commandments of God.

125
00:12:18,456 --> 00:12:19,599
