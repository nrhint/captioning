1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:09,615
The words which Alma, the High Priest according to

2
00:00:09,615 --> 00:00:19,23
 the holy order of God, delivered to the people in

3
00:00:19,23 --> 00:00:28,845
 their cities and villages throughout the land.

4
00:00:28,845 --> 00:00:38,46
 Beginning with chapter 5.Chapter 5 To gain

5
00:00:38,46 --> 00:00:48,075
 salvation, men must repent and keep the commandments, be

6
00:00:48,075 --> 00:00:57,69
 born again, cleanse their garments through the blood

7
00:00:57,69 --> 00:01:07,305
 of Christ, be humble and strip themselves of

8
00:01:07,305 --> 00:01:16,92
 pride and envy, and do the works of righteousness—The

9
00:01:16,92 --> 00:01:26,535
 Good Shepherd calls His people—Those who do evil

10
00:01:26,535 --> 00:01:36,15
 works are children of the devil—Alma testifies of

11
00:01:36,15 --> 00:01:45,765
 the truth of his doctrine and commands men to

12
00:01:45,765 --> 00:01:55,38
 repent—The names of the righteous will be written in

13
00:01:55,38 --> 00:02:04,995
 the book of life. About 83 B.C.

14
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:10,209
1 Now it came to pass that Alma began to deliver

15
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:14,459
 the word of God unto the people, first in the land

16
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:18,709
 of Zarahemla, and from thence throughout all the

17
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:22,959
 land

18
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:26,976
2 And these are the words which he spake to the

19
00:02:26,976 --> 00:02:30,976
 people in the church which was established in the

20
00:02:30,976 --> 00:02:34,976
 city of Zarahemla, according to his own record,

21
00:02:34,976 --> 00:02:38,976
 saying

22
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:44,692
3 I, Alma, having been consecrated by my father,

23
00:02:44,692 --> 00:02:50,692
 Alma, to be a high priest over the church of God,

24
00:02:50,692 --> 00:02:56,692
 he having power and authority from God to do these

25
00:02:56,692 --> 00:03:02,692
 things, behold, I say unto you that he began to

26
00:03:02,692 --> 00:03:08,692
 establish a church in the land which was in the

27
00:03:08,692 --> 00:03:14,692
 borders of Nephi; yea, the land which was called the

28
00:03:14,692 --> 00:03:20,692
 land of Mormon; yea, and he did baptize his

29
00:03:20,692 --> 00:03:26,692
 brethren in the waters of Mormon

30
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:32,073
4 And behold, I say unto you, they were delivered

31
00:03:32,073 --> 00:03:38,073
 out of the hands of the people of king Noah, by

32
00:03:38,073 --> 00:03:44,073
 the mercy and power of God

33
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:50,248
5 And behold, after that, they were brought into

34
00:03:50,248 --> 00:03:56,105
 bondage by the hands of the Lamanites in the

35
00:03:56,105 --> 00:04:01,962
 wilderness; yea, I say unto you, they were in captivity,

36
00:04:01,962 --> 00:04:07,819
 and again the Lord did deliver them out of

37
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:13,676
 bondage by the power of his word; and we were brought

38
00:04:13,676 --> 00:04:19,533
 into this land, and here we began to establish the

39
00:04:19,533 --> 00:04:25,39
 church of God throughout this land also

40
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:31,007
6 And now behold, I say unto you, my brethren, you

41
00:04:31,007 --> 00:04:36,882
 that belong to this church, have you sufficiently

42
00:04:36,882 --> 00:04:42,757
 retained in remembrance the captivity of your

43
00:04:42,757 --> 00:04:48,632
 fathers? Yea, and have you sufficiently retained in

44
00:04:48,632 --> 00:04:54,507
 remembrance his mercy and long-suffering towards

45
00:04:54,507 --> 00:05:00,382
 them? And moreover, have ye sufficiently retained in

46
00:05:00,382 --> 00:05:06,257
 remembrance that he has delivered their souls

47
00:05:06,257 --> 00:05:12,132
 from hell

48
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:17,762
7 Behold, he changed their hearts; yea, he

49
00:05:17,762 --> 00:05:23,512
 awakened them out of a deep sleep, and they awoke unto

50
00:05:23,512 --> 00:05:29,262
 God. Behold, they were in the midst of darkness;

51
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:35,012
 nevertheless, their souls were illuminated by the

52
00:05:35,012 --> 00:05:40,762
 light of the everlasting word; yea, they were

53
00:05:40,762 --> 00:05:46,512
 encircled about by the bands of death, and the chains of

54
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:52,262
 hell, and an everlasting destruction did await

55
00:05:52,262 --> 00:05:58,012
 them

56
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:03,892
8 And now I ask of you, my brethren, were they

57
00:06:03,892 --> 00:06:08,892
 destroyed? Behold, I say unto you, Nay, they were

58
00:06:08,892 --> 00:06:13,892
 not

59
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:19,874
9 And again I ask, were the bands of death broken,

60
00:06:19,874 --> 00:06:25,874
 and the chains of hell which encircled them

61
00:06:25,874 --> 00:06:31,874
 about, were they loosed? I say unto you, Yea, they were

62
00:06:31,874 --> 00:06:37,874
 loosed, and their souls did expand, and they did

63
00:06:37,874 --> 00:06:43,874
 sing redeeming love. And I say unto you that they

64
00:06:43,874 --> 00:06:49,874
 are saved

65
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:56,243
10 And now I ask of you on what conditions are

66
00:06:56,243 --> 00:07:02,643
 they saved? Yea, what grounds had they to hope for

67
00:07:02,643 --> 00:07:09,043
 salvation? What is the cause of their being loosed

68
00:07:09,043 --> 00:07:15,443
 from the bands of death, yea, and also the chains

69
00:07:15,443 --> 00:07:21,843
 of hell

70
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:27,074
11 Behold, I can tell you—did not my father Alma

71
00:07:27,074 --> 00:07:32,874
 believe in the words which were delivered by the

72
00:07:32,874 --> 00:07:38,674
 mouth of Abinadi? And was he not a holy prophet? Did

73
00:07:38,674 --> 00:07:44,474
 he not speak the words of God, and my father Alma

74
00:07:44,474 --> 00:07:50,274
 believe them

75
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:55,503
12 And according to his faith there was a mighty

76
00:07:55,503 --> 00:08:00,503
 change wrought in his heart. Behold I say unto you

77
00:08:00,503 --> 00:08:05,503
 that this is all true

78
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:11,252
13 And behold, he preached the word unto your

79
00:08:11,252 --> 00:08:16,752
 fathers, and a mighty change was also wrought in their

80
00:08:16,752 --> 00:08:22,252
 hearts, and they humbled themselves and put their

81
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:27,752
 trust in the true and living God. And behold,

82
00:08:27,752 --> 00:08:33,252
 they were faithful until the end; therefore they were

83
00:08:33,252 --> 00:08:38,752
 saved

84
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:44,352
14 And now behold, I ask of you, my brethren of

85
00:08:44,352 --> 00:08:49,952
 the church, have ye spiritually been born of God?

86
00:08:49,952 --> 00:08:55,552
 Have ye received his image in your countenances?

87
00:08:55,552 --> 00:09:01,152
 Have ye experienced this mighty change in your

88
00:09:01,152 --> 00:09:06,752
 hearts

89
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:14,546
15 Do ye exercise faith in the redemption of him

90
00:09:14,546 --> 00:09:22,379
 who created you? Do you look forward with an eye of

91
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:30,212
 faith, and view this mortal body raised in

92
00:09:30,212 --> 00:09:38,045
 immortality, and this corruption raised in incorruption,

93
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:45,878
 to stand before God to be judged according to the

94
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:53,711
 deeds which have been done in the mortal body

95
00:09:53,66 --> 00:09:59,26
16 I say unto you, can you imagine to yourselves

96
00:09:59,26 --> 00:10:04,86
 that ye hear the voice of the Lord, saying unto

97
00:10:04,86 --> 00:10:10,46
 you, in that day: Come unto me ye blessed, for

98
00:10:10,46 --> 00:10:16,06
 behold, your works have been the works of righteousness

99
00:10:16,06 --> 00:10:21,66
 upon the face of the earth

100
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:27,604
17 Or do ye imagine to yourselves that ye can lie

101
00:10:27,604 --> 00:10:33,854
 unto the Lord in that day, and say—Lord, our works

102
00:10:33,854 --> 00:10:40,104
 have been righteous works upon the face of the

103
00:10:40,104 --> 00:10:46,354
 earth—and that he will save you

104
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:52,779
18 Or otherwise, can ye imagine yourselves brought

105
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:59,112
 before the tribunal of God with your souls filled

106
00:10:59,112 --> 00:11:05,445
 with guilt and remorse, having a remembrance of

107
00:11:05,445 --> 00:11:11,778
 all your guilt, yea, a perfect remembrance of all

108
00:11:11,778 --> 00:11:18,111
 your wickedness, yea, a remembrance that ye have

109
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:24,444
 set at defiance the commandments of God

110
00:11:24,45 --> 00:11:30,7
19 I say unto you, can ye look up to God at that

111
00:11:30,7 --> 00:11:36,95
 day with a pure heart and clean hands? I say unto

112
00:11:36,95 --> 00:11:43,2
 you, can you look up, having the image of God

113
00:11:43,2 --> 00:11:49,45
 engraven upon your countenances

114
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:53,209
20 I say unto you, can ye think of being saved

115
00:11:53,209 --> 00:11:57,209
 when you have yielded yourselves to become subjects

116
00:11:57,209 --> 00:12:01,209
 to the devil

117
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:07,758
21 I say unto you, ye will know at that day that

118
00:12:07,758 --> 00:12:14,329
 ye cannot be saved; for there can no man be saved

119
00:12:14,329 --> 00:12:20,9
 except his garments are washed white; yea, his

120
00:12:20,9 --> 00:12:27,471
 garments must be purified until they are cleansed from

121
00:12:27,471 --> 00:12:34,042
 all stain, through the blood of him of whom it

122
00:12:34,042 --> 00:12:40,613
 has been spoken by our fathers, who should come to

123
00:12:40,613 --> 00:12:47,184
 redeem his people from their sins

124
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:53,967
22 And now I ask of you, my brethren, how will any

125
00:12:53,967 --> 00:13:00,367
 of you feel, if ye shall stand before the bar of

126
00:13:00,367 --> 00:13:06,767
 God, having your garments stained with blood and

127
00:13:06,767 --> 00:13:13,167
 all manner of filthiness? Behold, what will these

128
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:19,567
 things testify against you

129
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:24,431
23 Behold will they not testify that ye are

130
00:13:24,431 --> 00:13:29,764
 murderers, yea, and also that ye are guilty of all

131
00:13:29,764 --> 00:13:35,097
 manner of wickedness

132
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:43,715
24 Behold, my brethren, do ye suppose that such an

133
00:13:43,715 --> 00:13:51,715
 one can have a place to sit down in the kingdom

134
00:13:51,715 --> 00:13:59,715
 of God, with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob,

135
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:07,715
 and also all the holy prophets, whose garments are

136
00:14:07,715 --> 00:14:15,715
 cleansed and are spotless, pure and white

137
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:22,121
25 I say unto you, Nay; except ye make our Creator

138
00:14:22,121 --> 00:14:29,121
 a liar from the beginning, or suppose that he is

139
00:14:29,121 --> 00:14:36,121
 a liar from the beginning, ye cannot suppose that

140
00:14:36,121 --> 00:14:43,121
 such can have place in the kingdom of heaven; but

141
00:14:43,121 --> 00:14:50,121
 they shall be cast out for they are the children

142
00:14:50,121 --> 00:14:57,121
 of the kingdom of the devil

143
00:14:57,163 --> 00:15:05,163
26 And now behold, I say unto you, my brethren, if

144
00:15:05,163 --> 00:15:13,163
 ye have experienced a change of heart, and if ye

145
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:21,163
 have felt to sing the song of redeeming love, I

146
00:15:21,163 --> 00:15:29,163
 would ask, can ye feel so now

147
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:34,985
27 Have ye walked, keeping yourselves blameless

148
00:15:34,985 --> 00:15:40,842
 before God? Could ye say, if ye were called to die

149
00:15:40,842 --> 00:15:46,699
 at this time, within yourselves, that ye have been

150
00:15:46,699 --> 00:15:52,556
 sufficiently humble? That your garments have been

151
00:15:52,556 --> 00:15:58,413
 cleansed and made white through the blood of

152
00:15:58,413 --> 00:16:04,27
 Christ, who will come to redeem his people from their

153
00:16:04,27 --> 00:16:10,127
 sins

154
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:16,636
28 Behold, are ye stripped of pride? I say unto

155
00:16:16,636 --> 00:16:23,036
 you, if ye are not ye are not prepared to meet God.

156
00:16:23,036 --> 00:16:29,436
 Behold ye must prepare quickly; for the kingdom of

157
00:16:29,436 --> 00:16:35,836
 heaven is soon at hand, and such an one hath not

158
00:16:35,836 --> 00:16:42,236
 eternal life

159
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:49,235
29 Behold, I say, is there one among you who is

160
00:16:49,235 --> 00:16:55,735
 not stripped of envy? I say unto you that such an

161
00:16:55,735 --> 00:17:02,235
 one is not prepared; and I would that he should

162
00:17:02,235 --> 00:17:08,735
 prepare quickly, for the hour is close at hand, and he

163
00:17:08,735 --> 00:17:15,235
 knoweth not when the time shall come; for such an

164
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:21,735
 one is not found guiltless

165
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:26,574
30 And again I say unto you, is there one among

166
00:17:26,574 --> 00:17:31,574
 you that doth make a mock of his brother, or that

167
00:17:31,574 --> 00:17:36,574
 heapeth upon him persecutions

168
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:42,822
31 Wo unto such an one, for he is not prepared,

169
00:17:42,822 --> 00:17:48,822
 and the time is at hand that he must repent or he

170
00:17:48,822 --> 00:17:54,822
 cannot be saved

171
00:17:54,607 --> 00:18:02,607
32 Yea, even wo unto all ye workers of iniquity;

172
00:18:02,607 --> 00:18:10,607
 repent, repent, for the Lord God hath spoken it

173
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:18,556
33 Behold, he sendeth an invitation unto all men,

174
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:26,556
 for the arms of mercy are extended towards them,

175
00:18:26,556 --> 00:18:34,556
 and he saith: Repent, and I will receive you

176
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:39,763
34 Yea, he saith: Come unto me and ye shall

177
00:18:39,763 --> 00:18:45,513
 partake of the fruit of the tree of life; yea, ye shall

178
00:18:45,513 --> 00:18:51,263
 eat and drink of the bread and the waters of life

179
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:57,013
 freely

180
00:18:57,103 --> 00:19:02,77
35 Yea, come unto me and bring forth works of

181
00:19:02,77 --> 00:19:08,437
 righteousness, and ye shall not be hewn down and cast

182
00:19:08,437 --> 00:19:14,104
 into the fire

183
00:19:14,62 --> 00:19:21,62
36 For behold, the time is at hand that whosoever

184
00:19:21,62 --> 00:19:28,62
 bringeth forth not good fruit, or whosoever doeth

185
00:19:28,62 --> 00:19:35,62
 not the works of righteousness, the same have

186
00:19:35,62 --> 00:19:42,62
 cause to wail and mourn

187
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:48,844
37 O ye workers of iniquity; ye that are puffed up

188
00:19:48,844 --> 00:19:55,273
 in the vain things of the world, ye that have

189
00:19:55,273 --> 00:20:01,702
 professed to have known the ways of righteousness

190
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:08,131
 nevertheless have gone astray, as sheep having no

191
00:20:08,131 --> 00:20:14,56
 shepherd, notwithstanding a shepherd hath called

192
00:20:14,56 --> 00:20:20,989
 after you and is still calling after you, but ye will

193
00:20:20,989 --> 00:20:27,418
 not hearken unto his voice

194
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:34,226
38 Behold, I say unto you, that the good shepherd

195
00:20:34,226 --> 00:20:40,559
 doth call you; yea, and in his own name he doth

196
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:46,892
 call you, which is the name of Christ; and if ye

197
00:20:46,892 --> 00:20:53,225
 will not hearken unto the voice of the good shepherd,

198
00:20:53,225 --> 00:20:59,558
 to the name by which ye are called, behold, ye

199
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:05,891
 are not the sheep of the good shepherd

200
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:12,131
39 And now if ye are not the sheep of the good

201
00:21:12,131 --> 00:21:18,464
 shepherd, of what fold are ye? Behold, I say unto

202
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:24,797
 you, that the devil is your shepherd, and ye are of

203
00:21:24,797 --> 00:21:31,13
 his fold; and now, who can deny this? Behold, I say

204
00:21:31,13 --> 00:21:37,463
 unto you, whosoever denieth this is a liar and a

205
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:43,796
 child of the devil

206
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:46,369
40 For I say unto you that whatsoever is good

207
00:21:46,369 --> 00:21:49,036
 cometh from God, and whatsoever is evil cometh from

208
00:21:49,036 --> 00:21:51,703
 the devil

209
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:59,01
41 Therefore, if a man bringeth forth good works

210
00:21:59,01 --> 00:22:06,343
 he hearkeneth unto the voice of the good shepherd,

211
00:22:06,343 --> 00:22:13,676
 and he doth follow him; but whosoever bringeth

212
00:22:13,676 --> 00:22:21,009
 forth evil works, the same becometh a child of the

213
00:22:21,009 --> 00:22:28,342
 devil, for he hearkeneth unto his voice, and doth

214
00:22:28,342 --> 00:22:35,675
 follow him

215
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:41,688
42 And whosoever doeth this must receive his wages

216
00:22:41,688 --> 00:22:47,688
 of him; therefore, for his wages he receiveth

217
00:22:47,688 --> 00:22:53,688
 death, as to things pertaining unto righteousness,

218
00:22:53,688 --> 00:22:59,688
 being dead unto all good works

219
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:05,745
43 And now, my brethren, I would that ye should

220
00:23:05,745 --> 00:23:11,945
 hear me, for I speak in the energy of my soul; for

221
00:23:11,945 --> 00:23:18,145
 behold, I have spoken unto you plainly that ye

222
00:23:18,145 --> 00:23:24,345
 cannot err, or have spoken according to the

223
00:23:24,345 --> 00:23:30,545
 commandments of God

224
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:33,176
44 For I am called to speak after this manner,

225
00:23:33,176 --> 00:23:35,843
 according to the holy order of God, which is in

226
00:23:35,843 --> 00:23:38,51
 Christ Jesus; yea, I am commanded to stand and testify

227
00:23:38,51 --> 00:23:41,177
 unto this people the things which have been spoken

228
00:23:41,177 --> 00:23:43,844
 by our fathers concerning the things which are to

229
00:23:43,844 --> 00:23:46,511
 come

230
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:55,058
45 And this is not all. Do ye not suppose that I

231
00:23:55,058 --> 00:24:03,658
 know of these things myself? Behold, I testify unto

232
00:24:03,658 --> 00:24:12,258
 you that I do know that these things whereof I

233
00:24:12,258 --> 00:24:20,858
 have spoken are true. And how do ye suppose that I

234
00:24:20,858 --> 00:24:29,458
 know of their surety

235
00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:35,311
46 Behold, I say unto you they are made known unto

236
00:24:35,311 --> 00:24:41,454
 me by the Holy Spirit of God. Behold, I have

237
00:24:41,454 --> 00:24:47,597
 fasted and prayed many days that I might know these

238
00:24:47,597 --> 00:24:53,74
 things of myself. And now I do know of myself that

239
00:24:53,74 --> 00:24:59,883
 they are true; for the Lord God hath made them

240
00:24:59,883 --> 00:25:06,026
 manifest unto me by his Holy Spirit; and this is the

241
00:25:06,026 --> 00:25:12,169
 spirit of revelation which is in me

242
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:16,511
47 And moreover, I say unto you that it has thus

243
00:25:16,511 --> 00:25:20,511
 been revealed unto me, that the words which have

244
00:25:20,511 --> 00:25:24,511
 been spoken by our fathers are true, even so

245
00:25:24,511 --> 00:25:28,511
 according to the spirit of prophecy which is in me, which

246
00:25:28,511 --> 00:25:32,511
 is also by the manifestation of the Spirit of

247
00:25:32,511 --> 00:25:36,511
 God

248
00:25:36,435 --> 00:25:38,213
48 I say unto you, that I know of myself that

249
00:25:38,213 --> 00:25:39,991
 whatsoever I shall say unto you, concerning that which

250
00:25:39,991 --> 00:25:41,769
 is to come, is true; and I say unto you, that I

251
00:25:41,769 --> 00:25:43,547
 know that Jesus Christ shall come, yea, the Son,

252
00:25:43,547 --> 00:25:45,325
 the Only Begotten of the Father, full of grace, and

253
00:25:45,325 --> 00:25:47,103
 mercy, and truth. And behold, it is he that cometh

254
00:25:47,103 --> 00:25:48,881
 to take away the sins of the world, yea, the sins

255
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,659
 of every man who steadfastly believeth on his

256
00:25:50,659 --> 00:25:52,437
 name

257
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,384
49 And now I say unto you that this is the order

258
00:25:55,384 --> 00:25:58,384
 after which I am called, yea, to preach unto my

259
00:25:58,384 --> 00:26:01,384
 beloved brethren, yea, and every one that dwelleth in

260
00:26:01,384 --> 00:26:04,384
 the land; yea, to preach unto all, both old and

261
00:26:04,384 --> 00:26:07,384
 young, both bond and free; yea, I say unto you the

262
00:26:07,384 --> 00:26:10,384
 aged, and also the middle aged, and the rising

263
00:26:10,384 --> 00:26:13,384
 generation; yea, to cry unto them that they must

264
00:26:13,384 --> 00:26:16,384
 repent and be born again

265
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:18,308
50 Yea, thus saith the Spirit: Repent, all ye ends

266
00:26:18,308 --> 00:26:20,308
 of the earth, for the kingdom of heaven is soon

267
00:26:20,308 --> 00:26:22,308
 at hand; yea, the Son of God cometh in his glory,

268
00:26:22,308 --> 00:26:24,308
 in his might, majesty, power, and dominion. Yea, my

269
00:26:24,308 --> 00:26:26,308
 beloved brethren, I say unto you, that the Spirit

270
00:26:26,308 --> 00:26:28,308
 saith: Behold the glory of the King of all the

271
00:26:28,308 --> 00:26:30,308
 earth; and also the King of heaven shall very soon

272
00:26:30,308 --> 00:26:32,308
 shine forth among all the children of men

273
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:42,257
51 And also the Spirit saith unto me, yea, crieth

274
00:26:42,257 --> 00:26:52,257
 unto me with a mighty voice, saying: Go forth and

275
00:26:52,257 --> 00:27:02,257
 say unto this people—Repent, for except ye repent

276
00:27:02,257 --> 00:27:12,257
 ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of heaven

277
00:27:12,13 --> 00:27:13,274
52 And again I say unto you, the Spirit saith:

278
00:27:13,274 --> 00:27:14,417
 Behold, the ax is laid at the root of the tree;

279
00:27:14,417 --> 00:27:15,56
 therefore every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit

280
00:27:15,56 --> 00:27:16,702
 shall be hewn down and cast into the fire, yea, a

281
00:27:16,702 --> 00:27:17,845
 fire which cannot be consumed, even an

282
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:18,988
 unquenchable fire. Behold, and remember, the Holy One hath

283
00:27:18,988 --> 00:27:20,131
 spoken it

284
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:21,248
53 And now my beloved brethren, I say unto you,

285
00:27:21,248 --> 00:27:22,391
 can ye withstand these sayings; yea, can ye lay

286
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:23,534
 aside these things, and trample the Holy One under

287
00:27:23,534 --> 00:27:24,677
 your feet; yea, can ye be puffed up in the pride of

288
00:27:24,677 --> 00:27:25,82
 your hearts; yea, will ye still persist in the

289
00:27:25,82 --> 00:27:26,963
 wearing of costly apparel and setting your hearts upon

290
00:27:26,963 --> 00:27:28,106
 the vain things of the world, upon your riches

291
00:27:28,08 --> 00:27:32,509
54 Yea, will ye persist in supposing that ye are

292
00:27:32,509 --> 00:27:36,938
 better one than another; yea, will ye persist in

293
00:27:36,938 --> 00:27:41,367
 the persecution of your brethren, who humble

294
00:27:41,367 --> 00:27:45,796
 themselves and do walk after the holy order of God,

295
00:27:45,796 --> 00:27:50,225
 wherewith they have been brought into this church,

296
00:27:50,225 --> 00:27:54,654
 having been sanctified by the Holy Spirit, and they do

297
00:27:54,654 --> 00:27:59,083
 bring forth works which are meet for repentance

298
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:02,645
55 Yea, and will you persist in turning your backs

299
00:28:02,645 --> 00:28:05,312
 upon the poor, and the needy, and in withholding

300
00:28:05,312 --> 00:28:07,979
 your substance from them

301
00:28:07,953 --> 00:28:11,953
56 And finally, all ye that will persist in your

302
00:28:11,953 --> 00:28:15,953
 wickedness, I say unto you that these are they who

303
00:28:15,953 --> 00:28:19,953
 shall be hewn down and cast into the fire except

304
00:28:19,953 --> 00:28:23,953
 they speedily repent

305
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:26,569
57 And now I say unto you, all you that are

306
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:29,236
 desirous to follow the voice of the good shepherd, come

307
00:28:29,236 --> 00:28:31,903
 ye out from the wicked, and be ye separate, and

308
00:28:31,903 --> 00:28:34,57
 touch not their unclean things; and behold, their

309
00:28:34,57 --> 00:28:37,237
 names shall be blotted out, that the names of the

310
00:28:37,237 --> 00:28:39,904
 wicked shall not be numbered among the names of the

311
00:28:39,904 --> 00:28:42,571
 righteous, that the word of God may be fulfilled,

312
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:45,238
 which saith: The names of the wicked shall not be

313
00:28:45,238 --> 00:28:47,905
 mingled with the names of my people

314
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:49,159
58 For the names of the righteous shall be written

315
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:50,492
 in the book of life, and unto them will I grant

316
00:28:50,492 --> 00:28:51,825
 an inheritance at my right hand. And now, my

317
00:28:51,825 --> 00:28:53,158
 brethren, what have ye to say against this? I say unto

318
00:28:53,158 --> 00:28:54,491
 you, if ye speak against it, it matters not, for

319
00:28:54,491 --> 00:28:55,824
 the word of God must be fulfilled

320
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:59,801
59 For what shepherd is there among you having

321
00:28:59,801 --> 00:29:03,801
 many sheep doth not watch over them, that the wolves

322
00:29:03,801 --> 00:29:07,801
 enter not and devour his flock? And behold, if a

323
00:29:07,801 --> 00:29:11,801
 wolf enter his flock doth he not drive him out?

324
00:29:11,801 --> 00:29:15,801
 Yea, and at the last, if he can, he will destroy him

325
00:29:15,801 --> 00:29:19,801


326
00:29:19,725 --> 00:29:22,392
60 And now I say unto you that the good shepherd

327
00:29:22,392 --> 00:29:25,059
 doth call after you; and if you will hearken unto

328
00:29:25,059 --> 00:29:27,726
 his voice he will bring you into his fold, and ye

329
00:29:27,726 --> 00:29:30,393
 are his sheep; and he commandeth you that ye suffer

330
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:33,06
 no ravenous wolf to enter among you, that ye may

331
00:29:33,06 --> 00:29:35,727
 not be destroyed

332
00:29:35,674 --> 00:29:38,341
61 And now I, Alma, do command you in the language

333
00:29:38,341 --> 00:29:41,008
 of him who hath commanded me, that ye observe to

334
00:29:41,008 --> 00:29:43,675
 do the words which I have spoken unto you

335
00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:43,816
62 I speak by way of command unto you that belong

336
00:29:43,816 --> 00:29:43,983
 to the church; and unto those who do not belong to

337
00:29:43,983 --> 00:29:44,15
 the church I speak by way of invitation, saying:

338
00:29:44,15 --> 00:29:44,317
 Come and be baptized unto repentance, that ye also

339
00:29:44,317 --> 00:29:44,484
 may be partakers of the fruit of the tree of

340
00:29:44,484 --> 00:29:44,651
 life.
