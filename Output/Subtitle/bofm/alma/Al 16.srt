00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:09,833
Chapter 16 The Lamanites destroy the people of

2
00:00:09,833 --> 00:00:19,666
 Ammonihah—Zoram leads the Nephites to victory over

3
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:29,499
 the Lamanites—Alma and Amulek and many others preach

4
00:00:29,499 --> 00:00:39,332
 the word—They teach that after His Resurrection

5
00:00:39,332 --> 00:00:49,165
 Christ will appear to the Nephites. About

6
00:00:49,165 --> 00:00:58,998
 81–77 B.C.

7
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:04,677
1 And it came to pass in the eleventh year of the

8
00:01:04,677 --> 00:01:09,427
 reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, on

9
00:01:09,427 --> 00:01:14,177
 the fifth day of the second month, there having

10
00:01:14,177 --> 00:01:18,927
 been much peace in the land of Zarahemla, there

11
00:01:18,927 --> 00:01:23,677
 having been no wars nor contentions for a certain

12
00:01:23,677 --> 00:01:28,427
 number of years, even until the fifth day of the second

13
00:01:28,427 --> 00:01:33,177
 month in the eleventh year, there was a cry of

14
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:37,927
 war heard throughout the land

15
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:43,431
2 For behold, the armies of the Lamanites had come

16
00:01:43,431 --> 00:01:48,931
 in upon the wilderness side, into the borders of

17
00:01:48,931 --> 00:01:54,431
 the land, even into the city of Ammonihah, and

18
00:01:54,431 --> 00:01:59,931
 began to slay the people and destroy the city

19
00:01:59,72 --> 00:02:05,387
3 And now it came to pass, before the Nephites

20
00:02:05,387 --> 00:02:11,054
 could raise a sufficient army to drive them out of

21
00:02:11,054 --> 00:02:16,721
 the land, they had destroyed the people who were in

22
00:02:16,721 --> 00:02:22,388
 the city of Ammonihah, and also some around the

23
00:02:22,388 --> 00:02:28,055
 borders of Noah, and taken others captive into the

24
00:02:28,055 --> 00:02:33,722
 wilderness

25
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:38,687
4 Now it came to pass that the Nephites were

26
00:02:38,687 --> 00:02:43,687
 desirous to obtain those who had been carried away

27
00:02:43,687 --> 00:02:48,687
 captive into the wilderness

28
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:54,735
5 Therefore, he that had been appointed chief

29
00:02:54,735 --> 00:03:01,035
 captain over the armies of the Nephites, (and his name

30
00:03:01,035 --> 00:03:07,335
 was Zoram, and he had two sons, Lehi and Aha)—now

31
00:03:07,335 --> 00:03:13,635
 Zoram and his two sons, knowing that Alma was

32
00:03:13,635 --> 00:03:19,935
 high priest over the church, and having heard that he

33
00:03:19,935 --> 00:03:26,235
 had the spirit of prophecy, therefore they went

34
00:03:26,235 --> 00:03:32,535
 unto him and desired of him to know whither the

35
00:03:32,535 --> 00:03:38,835
 Lord would that they should go into the wilderness in

36
00:03:38,835 --> 00:03:45,135
 search of their brethren, who had been taken

37
00:03:45,135 --> 00:03:51,435
 captive by the Lamanites

38
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:57,198
6 And it came to pass that Alma inquired of the

39
00:03:57,198 --> 00:04:02,865
 Lord concerning the matter. And Alma returned and

40
00:04:02,865 --> 00:04:08,532
 said unto them: Behold, the Lamanites will cross the

41
00:04:08,532 --> 00:04:14,199
 river Sidon in the south wilderness, away up

42
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:19,866
 beyond the borders of the land of Manti. And behold

43
00:04:19,866 --> 00:04:25,533
 there shall ye meet them, on the east of the river

44
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:31,2
 Sidon, and there the Lord will deliver unto thee

45
00:04:31,2 --> 00:04:36,867
 thy brethren who have been taken captive by the

46
00:04:36,867 --> 00:04:42,534
 Lamanites

47
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:47,916
7 And it came to pass that Zoram and his sons

48
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:53,116
 crossed over the river Sidon, with their armies, and

49
00:04:53,116 --> 00:04:58,316
 marched away beyond the borders of Manti into the

50
00:04:58,316 --> 00:05:03,516
 south wilderness, which was on the east side of the

51
00:05:03,516 --> 00:05:08,716
 river Sidon

52
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:14,689
8 And they came upon the armies of the Lamanites,

53
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:20,403
 and the Lamanites were scattered and driven into

54
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:26,117
 the wilderness; and they took their brethren who

55
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:31,831
 had been taken captive by the Lamanites, and there

56
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:37,545
 was not one soul of them had been lost that were

57
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:43,259
 taken captive. And they were brought by their

58
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:48,973
 brethren to possess their own lands

59
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:56,015
9 And thus ended the eleventh year of the judges,

60
00:05:56,015 --> 00:06:03,183
 the Lamanites having been driven out of the land,

61
00:06:03,183 --> 00:06:10,349
 and the people of Ammonihah were destroyed; yea,

62
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:17,517
 every living soul of the Ammonihahites was

63
00:06:17,517 --> 00:06:24,683
 destroyed, and also their great city, which they said God

64
00:06:24,683 --> 00:06:31,851
 could not destroy, because of its greatness

65
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:36,724
10 But behold, in one day it was left desolate;

66
00:06:36,724 --> 00:06:42,391
 and the carcasses were mangled by dogs and wild

67
00:06:42,391 --> 00:06:48,058
 beasts of the wilderness

68
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:55,433
11 Nevertheless, after many days their dead bodies

69
00:06:55,433 --> 00:07:02,058
 were heaped up upon the face of the earth, and

70
00:07:02,058 --> 00:07:08,683
 they were covered with a shallow covering. And now

71
00:07:08,683 --> 00:07:15,308
 so great was the scent thereof that the people did

72
00:07:15,308 --> 00:07:21,933
 not go in to possess the land of Ammonihah for

73
00:07:21,933 --> 00:07:28,558
 many years. And it was called Desolation of Nehors;

74
00:07:28,558 --> 00:07:35,183
 for they were of the profession of Nehor, who were

75
00:07:35,183 --> 00:07:41,808
 slain; and their lands remained desolate

76
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:47,495
12 And the Lamanites did not come again to war

77
00:07:47,495 --> 00:07:53,295
 against the Nephites until the fourteenth year of the

78
00:07:53,295 --> 00:07:59,095
 reign of the judges over the people of Nephi. And

79
00:07:59,095 --> 00:08:04,895
 thus for three years did the people of Nephi have

80
00:08:04,895 --> 00:08:10,695
 continual peace in all the land

81
00:08:10,99 --> 00:08:17,74
13 And Alma and Amulek went forth preaching

82
00:08:17,74 --> 00:08:24,49
 repentance to the people in their temples, and in their

83
00:08:24,49 --> 00:08:31,24
 sanctuaries, and also in their synagogues, which

84
00:08:31,24 --> 00:08:37,99
 were built after the manner of the Jews

85
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:43,518
14 And as many as would hear their words, unto

86
00:08:43,518 --> 00:08:49,185
 them they did impart the word of God, without any

87
00:08:49,185 --> 00:08:54,852
 respect of persons, continually

88
00:08:54,934 --> 00:09:00,601
15 And thus did Alma and Amulek go forth, and also

89
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:06,268
 many more who had been chosen for the work, to

90
00:09:06,268 --> 00:09:11,935
 preach the word throughout all the land. And the

91
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:17,602
 establishment of the church became general throughout

92
00:09:17,602 --> 00:09:23,269
 the land, in all the region round about, among

93
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:28,936
 all the people of the Nephites

94
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:33,268
16 And there was no inequality among them; the

95
00:09:33,268 --> 00:09:38,435
 Lord did pour out his Spirit on all the face of the

96
00:09:38,435 --> 00:09:43,602
 land to prepare the minds of the children of men,

97
00:09:43,602 --> 00:09:48,769
 or to prepare their hearts to receive the word

98
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:53,936
 which should be taught among them at the time of his

99
00:09:53,936 --> 00:09:59,103
 coming

100
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:06,332
17 That they might not be hardened against the

101
00:10:06,332 --> 00:10:12,665
 word, that they might not be unbelieving, and go on

102
00:10:12,665 --> 00:10:18,998
 to destruction, but that they might receive the

103
00:10:18,998 --> 00:10:25,331
 word with joy, and as a branch be grafted into the

104
00:10:25,331 --> 00:10:31,664
 true vine, that they might enter into the rest of

105
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:37,997
 the Lord their God

106
00:10:37,67 --> 00:10:43,813
18 Now those priests who did go forth among the

107
00:10:43,813 --> 00:10:49,956
 people did preach against all lyings, and

108
00:10:49,956 --> 00:10:56,099
 deceivings, and envyings, and strifes, and malice, and

109
00:10:56,099 --> 00:11:02,242
 revilings, and stealing, robbing, plundering,

110
00:11:02,242 --> 00:11:08,385
 murdering, committing adultery, and all manner of

111
00:11:08,385 --> 00:11:14,528
 lasciviousness, crying that these things ought not so to

112
00:11:14,528 --> 00:11:20,671
 be

113
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:26,397
19 Holding forth things which must shortly come;

114
00:11:26,397 --> 00:11:32,147
 yea, holding forth the coming of the Son of God,

115
00:11:32,147 --> 00:11:37,897
 his sufferings and death, and also the resurrection

116
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:43,647
 of the dead

117
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:48,736
20 And many of the people did inquire concerning

118
00:11:48,736 --> 00:11:54,336
 the place where the Son of God should come; and

119
00:11:54,336 --> 00:11:59,936
 they were taught that he would appear unto them after

120
00:11:59,936 --> 00:12:05,536
 his resurrection; and this the people did hear

121
00:12:05,536 --> 00:12:11,136
 with great joy and gladness

122
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:16,574
21 And now after the church had been established

123
00:12:16,574 --> 00:12:21,717
 throughout all the land—having got the victory over

124
00:12:21,717 --> 00:12:26,86
 the devil, and the word of God being preached in

125
00:12:26,86 --> 00:12:32,003
 its purity in all the land, and the Lord pouring

126
00:12:32,003 --> 00:12:37,146
 out his blessings upon the people—thus ended the

127
00:12:37,146 --> 00:12:42,289
 fourteenth year of the reign of the judges over the

128
00:12:42,289 --> 00:12:47,432
 people of Nephi.
