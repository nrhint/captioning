00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:23,8
Chapter 4 Alma baptizes thousands of

2
00:00:23,8 --> 00:00:47,6
 converts—Iniquity enters the Church, and the Church’s progress

3
00:00:47,6 --> 00:01:11,4
 is hindered—Nephihah is appointed chief

4
00:01:11,4 --> 00:01:35,2
 judge—Alma, as high priest, devotes himself to the ministry.

5
00:01:35,2 --> 00:01:59,0
 About 86–83 B.C.

6
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:01,62
1 Now it came to pass in the sixth year of the

7
00:02:01,62 --> 00:02:03,62
 reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, there

8
00:02:03,62 --> 00:02:05,62
 were no contentions nor wars in the land of

9
00:02:05,62 --> 00:02:07,62
 Zarahemla

10
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:07,794
2 But the people were afflicted, yea, greatly

11
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:07,994
 afflicted for the loss of their brethren, and also for

12
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:08,194
 the loss of their flocks and herds, and also for

13
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:08,394
 the loss of their fields of grain, which were

14
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:08,594
 trodden under foot and destroyed by the Lamanites

15
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:08,994
3 And so great were their afflictions that every

16
00:02:08,994 --> 00:02:09,827
 soul had cause to mourn; and they believed that it

17
00:02:09,827 --> 00:02:10,66
 was the judgments of God sent upon them because of

18
00:02:10,66 --> 00:02:11,493
 their wickedness and their abominations;

19
00:02:11,493 --> 00:02:12,326
 therefore they were awakened to a remembrance of their

20
00:02:12,326 --> 00:02:13,159
 duty

21
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:19,3
4 And they began to establish the church more

22
00:02:19,3 --> 00:02:25,133
 fully; yea, and many were baptized in the waters of

23
00:02:25,133 --> 00:02:30,966
 Sidon and were joined to the church of God; yea,

24
00:02:30,966 --> 00:02:36,799
 they were baptized by the hand of Alma, who had been

25
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:42,632
 consecrated the high priest over the people of the

26
00:02:42,632 --> 00:02:48,465
 church, by the hand of his father Alma

27
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:53,131
5 And it came to pass in the seventh year of the

28
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:57,56
 reign of the judges there were about three thousand

29
00:02:57,56 --> 00:03:01,989
 five hundred souls that united themselves to the

30
00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:06,418
 church of God and were baptized. And thus ended

31
00:03:06,418 --> 00:03:10,847
 the seventh year of the reign of the judges over the

32
00:03:10,847 --> 00:03:15,276
 people of Nephi; and there was continual peace in

33
00:03:15,276 --> 00:03:19,705
 all that time

34
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:24,632
6 And it came to pass in the eighth year of the

35
00:03:24,632 --> 00:03:30,232
 reign of the judges, that the people of the church

36
00:03:30,232 --> 00:03:35,832
 began to wax proud, because of their exceeding

37
00:03:35,832 --> 00:03:41,432
 riches, and their fine silks, and their fine-twined

38
00:03:41,432 --> 00:03:47,032
 linen, and because of their many flocks and herds,

39
00:03:47,032 --> 00:03:52,632
 and their gold and their silver, and all manner of

40
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:58,232
 precious things, which they had obtained by their

41
00:03:58,232 --> 00:04:03,832
 industry; and in all these things were they lifted

42
00:04:03,832 --> 00:04:09,432
 up in the pride of their eyes, for they began to

43
00:04:09,432 --> 00:04:15,032
 wear very costly apparel

44
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:21,822
7 Now this was the cause of much affliction to

45
00:04:21,822 --> 00:04:28,155
 Alma, yea, and to many of the people whom Alma had

46
00:04:28,155 --> 00:04:34,488
 consecrated to be teachers, and priests, and elders

47
00:04:34,488 --> 00:04:40,821
 over the church; yea, many of them were sorely

48
00:04:40,821 --> 00:04:47,154
 grieved for the wickedness which they saw had begun

49
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:53,487
 to be among their people

50
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:59,407
8 For they saw and beheld with great sorrow that

51
00:04:59,407 --> 00:05:05,121
 the people of the church began to be lifted up in

52
00:05:05,121 --> 00:05:10,835
 the pride of their eyes, and to set their hearts

53
00:05:10,835 --> 00:05:16,549
 upon riches and upon the vain things of the world,

54
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:22,263
 that they began to be scornful, one towards

55
00:05:22,263 --> 00:05:27,977
 another, and they began to persecute those that did not

56
00:05:27,977 --> 00:05:33,691
 believe according to their own will and pleasure

57
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:39,4
9 And thus, in this eighth year of the reign of

58
00:05:39,4 --> 00:05:45,233
 the judges, there began to be great contentions

59
00:05:45,233 --> 00:05:51,066
 among the people of the church; yea, there were

60
00:05:51,066 --> 00:05:56,899
 envyings, and strife, and malice, and persecutions, and

61
00:05:56,899 --> 00:06:02,732
 pride, even to exceed the pride of those who did

62
00:06:02,732 --> 00:06:08,565
 not belong to the church of God

63
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:14,401
10 And thus ended the eighth year of the reign of

64
00:06:14,401 --> 00:06:20,401
 the judges; and the wickedness of the church was a

65
00:06:20,401 --> 00:06:26,401
 great stumbling-block to those who did not belong

66
00:06:26,401 --> 00:06:32,401
 to the church; and thus the church began to fail

67
00:06:32,401 --> 00:06:38,401
 in its progress

68
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:43,298
11 And it came to pass in the commencement of the

69
00:06:43,298 --> 00:06:48,465
 ninth year, Alma saw the wickedness of the church,

70
00:06:48,465 --> 00:06:53,632
 and he saw also that the example of the church

71
00:06:53,632 --> 00:06:58,799
 began to lead those who were unbelievers on from one

72
00:06:58,799 --> 00:07:03,966
 piece of iniquity to another, thus bringing on

73
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:09,133
 the destruction of the people

74
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:13,562
12 Yea, he saw great inequality among the people,

75
00:07:13,562 --> 00:07:18,062
 some lifting themselves up with their pride,

76
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:22,562
 despising others, turning their backs upon the needy

77
00:07:22,562 --> 00:07:27,062
 and the naked and those who were hungry, and those

78
00:07:27,062 --> 00:07:31,562
 who were athirst, and those who were sick and

79
00:07:31,562 --> 00:07:36,062
 afflicted

80
00:07:36,99 --> 00:07:42,99
13 Now this was a great cause for lamentations

81
00:07:42,99 --> 00:07:48,99
 among the people, while others were abasing

82
00:07:48,99 --> 00:07:54,99
 themselves, succoring those who stood in need of their

83
00:07:54,99 --> 00:08:00,99
 succor, such as imparting their substance to the poor

84
00:08:00,99 --> 00:08:06,99
 and the needy, feeding the hungry, and suffering

85
00:08:06,99 --> 00:08:12,99
 all manner of afflictions, for Christ’s sake, who

86
00:08:12,99 --> 00:08:18,99
 should come according to the spirit of prophecy

87
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:24,031
14 Looking forward to that day, thus retaining a

88
00:08:24,031 --> 00:08:30,031
 remission of their sins; being filled with great

89
00:08:30,031 --> 00:08:36,031
 joy because of the resurrection of the dead,

90
00:08:36,031 --> 00:08:42,031
 according to the will and power and deliverance of Jesus

91
00:08:42,031 --> 00:08:48,031
 Christ from the bands of death

92
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:54,294
15 And now it came to pass that Alma, having seen

93
00:08:54,294 --> 00:09:00,127
 the afflictions of the humble followers of God,

94
00:09:00,127 --> 00:09:05,96
 and the persecutions which were heaped upon them by

95
00:09:05,96 --> 00:09:11,793
 the remainder of his people, and seeing all their

96
00:09:11,793 --> 00:09:17,626
 inequality, began to be very sorrowful;

97
00:09:17,626 --> 00:09:23,459
 nevertheless the Spirit of the Lord did not fail him

98
00:09:23,73 --> 00:09:29,063
16 And he selected a wise man who was among the

99
00:09:29,063 --> 00:09:34,396
 elders of the church, and gave him power according

100
00:09:34,396 --> 00:09:39,729
 to the voice of the people, that he might have

101
00:09:39,729 --> 00:09:45,062
 power to enact laws according to the laws which had

102
00:09:45,062 --> 00:09:50,395
 been given, and to put them in force according to

103
00:09:50,395 --> 00:09:55,728
 the wickedness and the crimes of the people

104
00:09:55,695 --> 00:10:02,028
17 Now this man’s name was Nephihah, and he was

105
00:10:02,028 --> 00:10:08,361
 appointed chief judge; and he sat in the

106
00:10:08,361 --> 00:10:14,694
 judgment-seat to judge and to govern the people

107
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:19,464
18 Now Alma did not grant unto him the office of

108
00:10:19,464 --> 00:10:24,214
 being high priest over the church, but he retained

109
00:10:24,214 --> 00:10:28,964
 the office of high priest unto himself; but he

110
00:10:28,964 --> 00:10:33,714
 delivered the judgment-seat unto Nephihah

111
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:40,3
19 And this he did that he himself might go forth

112
00:10:40,3 --> 00:10:46,633
 among his people, or among the people of Nephi,

113
00:10:46,633 --> 00:10:52,966
 that he might preach the word of God unto them, to

114
00:10:52,966 --> 00:10:59,299
 stir them up in remembrance of their duty, and that

115
00:10:59,299 --> 00:11:05,632
 he might pull down, by the word of God, all the

116
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:11,965
 pride and craftiness and all the contentions which

117
00:11:11,965 --> 00:11:18,298
 were among his people, seeing no way that he might

118
00:11:18,298 --> 00:11:24,631
 reclaim them save it were in bearing down in pure

119
00:11:24,631 --> 00:11:30,964
 testimony against them

120
00:11:30,19 --> 00:11:31,19
20 And thus in the commencement of the ninth year

121
00:11:31,19 --> 00:11:32,19
 of the reign of the judges over the people of

122
00:11:32,19 --> 00:11:33,19
 Nephi, Alma delivered up the judgment-seat to

123
00:11:33,19 --> 00:11:34,19
 Nephihah, and confined himself wholly to the high

124
00:11:34,19 --> 00:11:35,19
 priesthood of the holy order of God, to the testimony of

125
00:11:35,19 --> 00:11:36,19
 the word, according to the spirit of revelation and

126
00:11:36,19 --> 00:11:37,19
 prophecy.
