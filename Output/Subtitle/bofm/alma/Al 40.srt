00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:09,333
Chapter 40 Christ brings to pass the resurrection

2
00:00:09,333 --> 00:00:18,666
 of all men—The righteous dead go to paradise and

3
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:27,999
 the wicked to outer darkness to await the day of

4
00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:37,332
 their resurrection—All things will be restored to

5
00:00:37,332 --> 00:00:46,665
 their proper and perfect frame in the Resurrection.

6
00:00:46,665 --> 00:00:55,998
 About 74 B.C.

7
00:00:56,023 --> 00:01:07,69
1 Now my son, here is somewhat more I would say

8
00:01:07,69 --> 00:01:19,357
 unto thee; for I perceive that thy mind is worried

9
00:01:19,357 --> 00:01:31,024
 concerning the resurrection of the dead

10
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:58,358
2 Behold, I say unto you, that there is no

11
00:01:58,358 --> 00:02:25,358
 resurrection—or, I would say, in other words, that this

12
00:02:25,358 --> 00:02:52,358
 mortal does not put on immortality, this corruption

13
00:02:52,358 --> 00:03:19,358
 does not put on incorruption—until after the

14
00:03:19,358 --> 00:03:46,358
 coming of Christ

15
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:48,927
3 Behold, he bringeth to pass the resurrection of

16
00:03:48,927 --> 00:03:50,927
 the dead. But behold, my son, the resurrection is

17
00:03:50,927 --> 00:03:52,927
 not yet. Now, I unfold unto you a mystery;

18
00:03:52,927 --> 00:03:54,927
 nevertheless, there are many mysteries which are kept,

19
00:03:54,927 --> 00:03:56,927
 that no one knoweth them save God himself. But I

20
00:03:56,927 --> 00:03:58,927
 show unto you one thing which I have inquired

21
00:03:58,927 --> 00:04:00,927
 diligently of God that I might know—that is concerning

22
00:04:00,927 --> 00:04:02,927
 the resurrection

23
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:22,876
4 Behold, there is a time appointed that all shall

24
00:04:22,876 --> 00:04:42,876
 come forth from the dead. Now when this time

25
00:04:42,876 --> 00:05:02,876
 cometh no one knows; but God knoweth the time which is

26
00:05:02,876 --> 00:05:22,876
 appointed

27
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:25,29
5 Now, whether there shall be one time, or a

28
00:05:25,29 --> 00:05:27,957
 second time, or a third time, that men shall come forth

29
00:05:27,957 --> 00:05:30,624
 from the dead, it mattereth not; for God knoweth

30
00:05:30,624 --> 00:05:33,291
 all these things; and it sufficeth me to know that

31
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,958
 this is the case—that there is a time appointed

32
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:38,625
 that all shall rise from the dead

33
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:46,572
6 Now there must needs be a space betwixt the time

34
00:05:46,572 --> 00:05:54,572
 of death and the time of the resurrection

35
00:05:54,521 --> 00:06:18,521
7 And now I would inquire what becometh of the

36
00:06:18,521 --> 00:06:42,521
 souls of men from this time of death to the time

37
00:06:42,521 --> 00:07:06,521
 appointed for the resurrection

38
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:17,493
8 Now whether there is more than one time

39
00:07:17,493 --> 00:07:28,693
 appointed for men to rise it mattereth not; for all do not

40
00:07:28,693 --> 00:07:39,893
 die at once, and this mattereth not; all is as

41
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:51,093
 one day with God, and time only is measured unto

42
00:07:51,093 --> 00:08:02,293
 men

43
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:11,115
9 Therefore, there is a time appointed unto men

44
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:20,115
 that they shall rise from the dead; and there is a

45
00:08:20,115 --> 00:08:29,115
 space between the time of death and the

46
00:08:29,115 --> 00:08:38,115
 resurrection. And now, concerning this space of time, what

47
00:08:38,115 --> 00:08:47,115
 becometh of the souls of men is the thing which I

48
00:08:47,115 --> 00:08:56,115
 have inquired diligently of the Lord to know; and

49
00:08:56,115 --> 00:09:05,115
 this is the thing of which I do know

50
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:08,58
10 And when the time cometh when all shall rise,

51
00:09:08,58 --> 00:09:11,247
 then shall they know that God knoweth all the times

52
00:09:11,247 --> 00:09:13,914
 which are appointed unto man

53
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:24,173
11 Now, concerning the state of the soul between

54
00:09:24,173 --> 00:09:34,459
 death and the resurrection—Behold, it has been made

55
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:44,745
 known unto me by an angel, that the spirits of

56
00:09:44,745 --> 00:09:55,031
 all men, as soon as they are departed from this

57
00:09:55,031 --> 00:10:05,317
 mortal body, yea, the spirits of all men, whether they

58
00:10:05,317 --> 00:10:15,603
 be good or evil, are taken home to that God who

59
00:10:15,603 --> 00:10:25,889
 gave them life

60
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:28,326
12 And then shall it come to pass, that the

61
00:10:28,326 --> 00:10:30,993
 spirits of those who are righteous are received into a

62
00:10:30,993 --> 00:10:33,66
 state of happiness, which is called paradise, a

63
00:10:33,66 --> 00:10:36,327
 state of rest, a state of peace, where they shall

64
00:10:36,327 --> 00:10:38,994
 rest from all their troubles and from all care, and

65
00:10:38,994 --> 00:10:41,661
 sorrow

66
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:42,408
13 And then shall it come to pass, that the

67
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:43,208
 spirits of the wicked, yea, who are evil—for behold,

68
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,008
 they have no part nor portion of the Spirit of the

69
00:10:44,008 --> 00:10:44,808
 Lord; for behold, they chose evil works rather than

70
00:10:44,808 --> 00:10:45,608
 good; therefore the spirit of the devil did enter

71
00:10:45,608 --> 00:10:46,408
 into them, and take possession of their house—and

72
00:10:46,408 --> 00:10:47,208
 these shall be cast out into outer darkness; there

73
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:48,008
 shall be weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of

74
00:10:48,008 --> 00:10:48,808
 teeth, and this because of their own iniquity, being

75
00:10:48,808 --> 00:10:49,608
 led captive by the will of the devil

76
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:53,583
14 Now this is the state of the souls of the

77
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:57,583
 wicked, yea, in darkness, and a state of awful, fearful

78
00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:01,583
 looking for the fiery indignation of the wrath of

79
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:05,583
 God upon them; thus they remain in this state, as

80
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:09,583
 well as the righteous in paradise, until the time

81
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:13,583
 of their resurrection

82
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:23,793
15 Now, there are some that have understood that

83
00:11:23,793 --> 00:11:34,079
 this state of happiness and this state of misery of

84
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:44,365
 the soul, before the resurrection, was a first

85
00:11:44,365 --> 00:11:54,651
 resurrection. Yea, I admit it may be termed a

86
00:11:54,651 --> 00:12:04,937
 resurrection, the raising of the spirit or the soul and

87
00:12:04,937 --> 00:12:15,223
 their consignation to happiness or misery,

88
00:12:15,223 --> 00:12:25,509
 according to the words which have been spoken

89
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:39,279
16 And behold, again it hath been spoken, that

90
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:53,279
 there is a first resurrection, a resurrection of all

91
00:12:53,279 --> 00:13:07,279
 those who have been, or who are, or who shall be,

92
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:21,279
 down to the resurrection of Christ from the dead

93
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:16,343
19 Now, whether the souls and the bodies of those

94
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:20,914
 of whom has been spoken shall all be reunited at

95
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:25,485
 once, the wicked as well as the righteous, I do not

96
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:30,056
 say; let it suffice, that I say that they all

97
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:34,627
 come forth; or in other words, their resurrection

98
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:39,198
 cometh to pass before the resurrection of those who

99
00:01:39,198 --> 00:01:43,769
 die after the resurrection of Christ

100
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:50,337
20 Now, my son, I do not say that their

101
00:01:50,337 --> 00:01:57,004
 resurrection cometh at the resurrection of Christ; but

102
00:01:57,004 --> 00:02:03,671
 behold, I give it as my opinion, that the souls and the

103
00:02:03,671 --> 00:02:10,338
 bodies are reunited, of the righteous, at the

104
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:17,005
 resurrection of Christ, and his ascension into

105
00:02:17,005 --> 00:02:23,672
 heaven

106
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:24,544
21 But whether it be at his resurrection or after,

107
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:25,544
 I do not say; but this much I say, that there is

108
00:02:25,544 --> 00:02:26,544
 a space between death and the resurrection of the

109
00:02:26,544 --> 00:02:27,544
 body, and a state of the soul in happiness or in

110
00:02:27,544 --> 00:02:28,544
 misery until the time which is appointed of God

111
00:02:28,544 --> 00:02:29,544
 that the dead shall come forth, and be reunited, both

112
00:02:29,544 --> 00:02:30,544
 soul and body, and be brought to stand before

113
00:02:30,544 --> 00:02:31,544
 God, and be judged according to their works

114
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:44,851
22 Yea, this bringeth about the restoration of

115
00:02:44,851 --> 00:02:58,184
 those things of which has been spoken by the mouths

116
00:02:58,184 --> 00:03:11,517
 of the prophets

117
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:22,591
23 The soul shall be restored to the body, and the

118
00:03:22,591 --> 00:03:33,791
 body to the soul; yea, and every limb and joint

119
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:44,991
 shall be restored to its body; yea, even a hair of

120
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:56,191
 the head shall not be lost; but all things shall

121
00:03:56,191 --> 00:04:07,391
 be restored to their proper and perfect frame

122
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:15,214
24 And now, my son, this is the restoration of

123
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:23,214
 which has been spoken by the mouths of the prophets

124
00:04:23,163 --> 00:05:06,663
25 And then shall the righteous shine forth in the

125
00:05:06,663 --> 00:05:50,163
 kingdom of God

126
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:51,009
26 But behold, an awful death cometh upon the

127
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:51,134
 wicked; for they die as to things pertaining to things

128
00:05:51,134 --> 00:05:51,259
 of righteousness; for they are unclean, and no

129
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:51,384
 unclean thing can inherit the kingdom of God; but

130
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:51,509
 they are cast out, and consigned to partake of the

131
00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:51,634
 fruits of their labors or their works, which have

132
00:05:51,634 --> 00:05:51,759
 been evil; and they drink the dregs of a bitter

133
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:51,884
 cup.
