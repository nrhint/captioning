The words of Alma which he delivered to the people

00:00:09,889 --> 00:00:19,778
 in Gideon, according to his own record.

00:00:19,778 --> 00:00:29,667
 Comprising chapter 7.Chapter 7 Christ will be born of

4
00:00:29,667 --> 00:00:39,556
 Mary—He will loose the bands of death and bear the sins

5
00:00:39,556 --> 00:00:49,445
 of His people—Those who repent, are baptized, and

6
00:00:49,445 --> 00:00:59,334
 keep the commandments will have eternal

7
00:00:59,334 --> 00:01:09,223
 life—Filthiness cannot inherit the kingdom of God—Humility,

8
00:01:09,223 --> 00:01:19,112
 faith, hope, and charity are required. About

 83 B.C.

10
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:34,389
1 Behold my beloved brethren, seeing that I have

11
00:01:34,389 --> 00:01:39,389
 been permitted to come unto you, therefore I

12
00:01:39,389 --> 00:01:44,389
 attempt to address you in my language; yea, by my own

13
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:49,389
 mouth, seeing that it is the first time that I have

14
00:01:49,389 --> 00:01:54,389
 spoken unto you by the words of my mouth, I having

15
00:01:54,389 --> 00:01:59,389
 been wholly confined to the judgment-seat, having

16
00:01:59,389 --> 00:02:04,389
 had much business that I could not come unto you

17
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:09,389


18
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:13,396
2 And even I could not have come now at this time

19
00:02:13,396 --> 00:02:17,396
 were it not that the judgment-seat hath been given

20
00:02:17,396 --> 00:02:21,396
 to another, to reign in my stead; and the Lord in

21
00:02:21,396 --> 00:02:25,396
 much mercy hath granted that I should come unto

22
00:02:25,396 --> 00:02:29,396
 you

23
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:35,878
3 And behold, I have come having great hopes and

24
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:42,307
 much desire that I should find that ye had humbled

25
00:02:42,307 --> 00:02:48,736
 yourselves before God, and that ye had continued

26
00:02:48,736 --> 00:02:55,165
 in the supplicating of his grace, that I should

27
00:02:55,165 --> 00:03:01,594
 find that ye were blameless before him, that I should

28
00:03:01,594 --> 00:03:08,023
 find that ye were not in the awful dilemma that

29
00:03:08,023 --> 00:03:14,452
 our brethren were in at Zarahemla

30
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:20,644
4 But blessed be the name of God, that he hath

31
00:03:20,644 --> 00:03:26,894
 given me to know, yea, hath given unto me the

32
00:03:26,894 --> 00:03:33,144
 exceedingly great joy of knowing that they are

33
00:03:33,144 --> 00:03:39,394
 established again in the way of his righteousness

34
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:44,186
5 And I trust, according to the Spirit of God

35
00:03:44,186 --> 00:03:49,186
 which is in me, that I shall also have joy over you;

36
00:03:49,186 --> 00:03:54,186
 nevertheless I do not desire that my joy over you

37
00:03:54,186 --> 00:03:59,186
 should come by the cause of so much afflictions and

38
00:03:59,186 --> 00:04:04,186
 sorrow which I have had for the brethren at

39
00:04:04,186 --> 00:04:09,186
 Zarahemla, for behold, my joy cometh over them after

40
00:04:09,186 --> 00:04:14,186
 wading through much affliction and sorrow

41
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:21,332
6 But behold, I trust that ye are not in a state

42
00:04:21,332 --> 00:04:27,776
 of so much unbelief as were your brethren; I trust

43
00:04:27,776 --> 00:04:34,22
 that ye are not lifted up in the pride of your

44
00:04:34,22 --> 00:04:40,664
 hearts; yea, I trust that ye have not set your hearts

45
00:04:40,664 --> 00:04:47,108
 upon riches and the vain things of the world;

46
00:04:47,108 --> 00:04:53,552
 yea, I trust that you do not worship idols, but that

47
00:04:53,552 --> 00:04:59,996
 ye do worship the true and the living God, and

48
00:04:59,996 --> 00:05:06,44
 that ye look forward for the remission of your sins,

49
00:05:06,44 --> 00:05:12,884
 with an everlasting faith, which is to come

50
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:17,278
7 For behold, I say unto you there be many things

51
00:05:17,278 --> 00:05:22,478
 to come; and behold, there is one thing which is

52
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:27,678
 of more importance than they all—for behold, the

53
00:05:27,678 --> 00:05:32,878
 time is not far distant that the Redeemer liveth and

54
00:05:32,878 --> 00:05:38,078
 cometh among his people

55
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:43,824
8 Behold, I do not say that he will come among us

56
00:05:43,824 --> 00:05:49,11
 at the time of his dwelling in his mortal

57
00:05:49,11 --> 00:05:54,396
 tabernacle; for behold, the Spirit hath not said unto me

58
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:59,682
 that this should be the case. Now as to this thing

59
00:05:59,682 --> 00:06:04,968
 I do not know; but this much I do know, that the

60
00:06:04,968 --> 00:06:10,254
 Lord God hath power to do all things which are

61
00:06:10,254 --> 00:06:15,54
 according to his word

62
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:22,409
9 But behold, the Spirit hath said this much unto

63
00:06:22,409 --> 00:06:29,076
 me, saying: Cry unto this people, saying—Repent

64
00:06:29,076 --> 00:06:35,743
 ye, and prepare the way of the Lord, and walk in his

65
00:06:35,743 --> 00:06:42,41
 paths, which are straight; for behold, the

66
00:06:42,41 --> 00:06:49,077
 kingdom of heaven is at hand, and the Son of God cometh

67
00:06:49,077 --> 00:06:55,744
 upon the face of the earth

68
00:06:55,615 --> 00:07:01,782
10 And behold, he shall be born of Mary, at

69
00:07:01,782 --> 00:07:07,949
 Jerusalem which is the land of our forefathers, she

70
00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:14,116
 being a virgin, a precious and chosen vessel, who

71
00:07:14,116 --> 00:07:20,283
 shall be overshadowed and conceive by the power of the

72
00:07:20,283 --> 00:07:26,45
 Holy Ghost, and bring forth a son, yea, even the

73
00:07:26,45 --> 00:07:32,617
 Son of God

74
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:38,052
11 And he shall go forth, suffering pains and

75
00:07:38,052 --> 00:07:43,252
 afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this

76
00:07:43,252 --> 00:07:48,452
 that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will

77
00:07:48,452 --> 00:07:53,652
 take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his

78
00:07:53,652 --> 00:07:58,852
 people

79
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:04,559
12 And he will take upon him death, that he may

80
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:10,273
 loose the bands of death which bind his people; and

81
00:08:10,273 --> 00:08:15,987
 he will take upon him their infirmities, that his

82
00:08:15,987 --> 00:08:21,701
 bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the

83
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:27,415
 flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how

84
00:08:27,415 --> 00:08:33,129
 to succor his people according to their

85
00:08:33,129 --> 00:08:38,843
 infirmities

86
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:44,985
13 Now the Spirit knoweth all things; nevertheless

87
00:08:44,985 --> 00:08:51,485
 the Son of God suffereth according to the flesh

88
00:08:51,485 --> 00:08:57,985
 that he might take upon him the sins of his people,

89
00:08:57,985 --> 00:09:04,485
 that he might blot out their transgressions

90
00:09:04,485 --> 00:09:10,985
 according to the power of his deliverance; and now

91
00:09:10,985 --> 00:09:17,485
 behold, this is the testimony which is in me

92
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:24,207
14 Now I say unto you that ye must repent, and be

93
00:09:24,207 --> 00:09:30,957
 born again; for the Spirit saith if ye are not

94
00:09:30,957 --> 00:09:37,707
 born again ye cannot inherit the kingdom of heaven;

95
00:09:37,707 --> 00:09:44,457
 therefore come and be baptized unto repentance,

96
00:09:44,457 --> 00:09:51,207
 that ye may be washed from your sins, that ye may

97
00:09:51,207 --> 00:09:57,957
 have faith on the Lamb of God, who taketh away the

98
00:09:57,957 --> 00:10:04,707
 sins of the world, who is mighty to save and to

99
00:10:04,707 --> 00:10:11,457
 cleanse from all unrighteousness

100
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:17,878
15 Yea, I say unto you come and fear not, and lay

101
00:10:17,878 --> 00:10:23,878
 aside every sin, which easily doth beset you,

102
00:10:23,878 --> 00:10:29,878
 which doth bind you down to destruction, yea, come and

103
00:10:29,878 --> 00:10:35,878
 go forth, and show unto your God that ye are

104
00:10:35,878 --> 00:10:41,878
 willing to repent of your sins and enter into a

105
00:10:41,878 --> 00:10:47,878
 covenant with him to keep his commandments, and witness

106
00:10:47,878 --> 00:10:53,878
 it unto him this day by going into the waters of

107
00:10:53,878 --> 00:10:59,878
 baptism

108
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:04,726
16 And whosoever doeth this, and keepeth the

109
00:11:04,726 --> 00:11:09,726
 commandments of God from thenceforth, the same will

110
00:11:09,726 --> 00:11:14,726
 remember that I say unto him, yea, he will remember

111
00:11:14,726 --> 00:11:19,726
 that I have said unto him, he shall have eternal

112
00:11:19,726 --> 00:11:24,726
 life, according to the testimony of the Holy Spirit,

113
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:29,726
 which testifieth in me

114
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:34,517
17 And now my beloved brethren, do you believe

115
00:11:34,517 --> 00:11:39,946
 these things? Behold, I say unto you, yea, I know

116
00:11:39,946 --> 00:11:45,375
 that ye believe them; and the way that I know that ye

117
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:50,804
 believe them is by the manifestation of the

118
00:11:50,804 --> 00:11:56,233
 Spirit which is in me. And now because your faith is

119
00:11:56,233 --> 00:12:01,662
 strong concerning that, yea, concerning the things

120
00:12:01,662 --> 00:12:07,091
 which I have spoken, great is my joy

121
00:12:07,86 --> 00:12:14,11
18 For as I said unto you from the beginning, that

122
00:12:14,11 --> 00:12:20,36
 I had much desire that ye were not in the state

123
00:12:20,36 --> 00:12:26,61
 of dilemma like your brethren, even so I have found

124
00:12:26,61 --> 00:12:32,86
 that my desires have been gratified

125
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:40,102
19 For I perceive that ye are in the paths of

126
00:12:40,102 --> 00:12:47,352
 righteousness; I perceive that ye are in the path

127
00:12:47,352 --> 00:12:54,602
 which leads to the kingdom of God; yea, I perceive

128
00:12:54,602 --> 00:13:01,852
 that ye are making his paths straight

129
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:08,485
20 I perceive that it has been made known unto

130
00:13:08,485 --> 00:13:15,056
 you, by the testimony of his word, that he cannot

131
00:13:15,056 --> 00:13:21,627
 walk in crooked paths; neither doth he vary from that

132
00:13:21,627 --> 00:13:28,198
 which he hath said; neither hath he a shadow of

133
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:34,769
 turning from the right to the left, or from that

134
00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:41,34
 which is right to that which is wrong; therefore,

135
00:13:41,34 --> 00:13:47,911
 his course is one eternal round

136
00:13:47,56 --> 00:13:54,06
21 And he doth not dwell in unholy temples;

137
00:13:54,06 --> 00:14:00,56
 neither can filthiness or anything which is unclean be

138
00:14:00,56 --> 00:14:07,06
 received into the kingdom of God; therefore I say

139
00:14:07,06 --> 00:14:13,56
 unto you the time shall come, yea, and it shall be

140
00:14:13,56 --> 00:14:20,06
 at the last day, that he who is filthy shall

141
00:14:20,06 --> 00:14:26,56
 remain in his filthiness

142
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:33,666
22 And now my beloved brethren, I have said these

143
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:40,866
 things unto you that I might awaken you to a sense

144
00:14:40,866 --> 00:14:48,066
 of your duty to God, that ye may walk blameless

145
00:14:48,066 --> 00:14:55,266
 before him, that ye may walk after the holy order

146
00:14:55,266 --> 00:15:02,466
 of God, after which ye have been received

147
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:07,81
23 And now I would that ye should be humble, and

148
00:15:07,81 --> 00:15:13,185
 be submissive and gentle; easy to be entreated;

149
00:15:13,185 --> 00:15:18,56
 full of patience and long-suffering; being temperate

150
00:15:18,56 --> 00:15:23,935
 in all things; being diligent in keeping the

151
00:15:23,935 --> 00:15:29,31
 commandments of God at all times; asking for whatsoever

152
00:15:29,31 --> 00:15:34,685
 things ye stand in need, both spiritual and

153
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:40,06
 temporal; always returning thanks unto God for

154
00:15:40,06 --> 00:15:45,435
 whatsoever things ye do receive

155
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:54,911
24 And see that ye have faith, hope, and charity,

156
00:15:54,911 --> 00:16:04,411
 and then ye will always abound in good works

157
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:10,877
25 And may the Lord bless you, and keep your

158
00:16:10,877 --> 00:16:17,591
 garments spotless, that ye may at last be brought to

159
00:16:17,591 --> 00:16:24,305
 sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the

160
00:16:24,305 --> 00:16:31,019
 holy prophets who have been ever since the world

161
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:37,733
 began, having your garments spotless even as their

162
00:16:37,733 --> 00:16:44,447
 garments are spotless, in the kingdom of heaven to go

163
00:16:44,447 --> 00:16:51,161
 no more out

164
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:57,377
26 And now my beloved brethren, I have spoken

165
00:16:57,377 --> 00:17:02,977
 these words unto you according to the Spirit which

166
00:17:02,977 --> 00:17:08,577
 testifieth in me; and my soul doth exceedingly

167
00:17:08,577 --> 00:17:14,177
 rejoice, because of the exceeding diligence and heed

168
00:17:14,177 --> 00:17:19,777
 which ye have given unto my word

169
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:20,605
27 And now, may the peace of God rest upon you,

170
00:17:20,605 --> 00:17:21,605
 and upon your houses and lands, and upon your flocks

171
00:17:21,605 --> 00:17:22,605
 and herds, and all that you possess, your women

172
00:17:22,605 --> 00:17:23,605
 and your children, according to your faith and good

173
00:17:23,605 --> 00:17:24,605
 works, from this time forth and forever. And thus

174
00:17:24,605 --> 00:17:25,605
 I have spoken. Amen.
