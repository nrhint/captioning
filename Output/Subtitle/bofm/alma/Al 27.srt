00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:21,167
Chapter 27 The Lord commands Ammon to lead the

2
00:00:21,167 --> 00:00:42,334
 people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi to safety—Upon meeting

3
00:00:42,334 --> 00:01:03,501
 Alma, Ammon’s joy exhausts his strength—The Nephites

4
00:01:03,501 --> 00:01:24,668
 give the Anti-Nephi-Lehies the land of Jershon—They

5
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:45,835
 are called the people of Ammon. About 90–77 B.C.

6
00:01:45,835 --> 00:02:07,002


7
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:10,794
1 Now it came to pass that when those Lamanites

8
00:02:10,794 --> 00:02:13,994
 who had gone to war against the Nephites had found,

9
00:02:13,994 --> 00:02:17,194
 after their many struggles to destroy them, that

10
00:02:17,194 --> 00:02:20,394
 it was in vain to seek their destruction, they

11
00:02:20,394 --> 00:02:23,594
 returned again to the land of Nephi

12
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:32,686
2 And it came to pass that the Amalekites, because

13
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:41,829
 of their loss, were exceedingly angry. And when

14
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:50,972
 they saw that they could not seek revenge from the

15
00:02:50,972 --> 00:03:00,115
 Nephites, they began to stir up the people in

16
00:03:00,115 --> 00:03:09,258
 anger against their brethren, the people of

17
00:03:09,258 --> 00:03:18,401
 Anti-Nephi-Lehi; therefore they began again to destroy them

18
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:27,544


19
00:03:27,34 --> 00:03:30,007
3 Now this people again refused to take their

20
00:03:30,007 --> 00:03:32,674
 arms, and they suffered themselves to be slain

21
00:03:32,674 --> 00:03:35,341
 according to the desires of their enemies

22
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:38,315
4 Now when Ammon and his brethren saw this work of

23
00:03:38,315 --> 00:03:41,315
 destruction among those whom they so dearly

24
00:03:41,315 --> 00:03:44,315
 beloved, and among those who had so dearly beloved

25
00:03:44,315 --> 00:03:47,315
 them—for they were treated as though they were angels

26
00:03:47,315 --> 00:03:50,315
 sent from God to save them from everlasting

27
00:03:50,315 --> 00:03:53,315
 destruction—therefore, when Ammon and his brethren saw

28
00:03:53,315 --> 00:03:56,315
 this great work of destruction, they were moved

29
00:03:56,315 --> 00:03:59,315
 with compassion, and they said unto the king

30
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,239
5 Let us gather together this people of the Lord,

31
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:03,239
 and let us go down to the land of Zarahemla to our

32
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,239
 brethren the Nephites, and flee out of the hands

33
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:07,239
 of our enemies, that we be not destroyed

34
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:20,547
6 But the king said unto them: Behold, the

35
00:04:20,547 --> 00:04:33,88
 Nephites will destroy us, because of the many murders and

36
00:04:33,88 --> 00:04:47,213
 sins we have committed against them

37
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,754
7 And Ammon said: I will go and inquire of the

38
00:04:49,754 --> 00:04:52,421
 Lord, and if he say unto us, go down unto our

39
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:55,088
 brethren, will ye go

40
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:55,061
8 And the king said unto him: Yea, if the Lord

41
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:55,061
 saith unto us go, we will go down unto our brethren,

42
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:55,061
 and we will be their slaves until we repair unto

43
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:55,061
 them the many murders and sins which we have

44
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:55,061
 committed against them

45
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:58,062
9 But Ammon said unto him: It is against the law

46
00:04:58,062 --> 00:05:00,462
 of our brethren, which was established by my

47
00:05:00,462 --> 00:05:02,862
 father, that there should be any slaves among them;

48
00:05:02,862 --> 00:05:05,262
 therefore let us go down and rely upon the mercies of

49
00:05:05,262 --> 00:05:07,662
 our brethren

50
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:23,174
10 But the king said unto him: Inquire of the

51
00:05:23,174 --> 00:05:39,174
 Lord, and if he saith unto us go, we will go;

52
00:05:39,174 --> 00:05:55,174
 otherwise we will perish in the land

53
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,021
11 And it came to pass that Ammon went and

54
00:05:57,021 --> 00:05:59,021
 inquired of the Lord, and the Lord said unto him

55
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:10,378
12 Get this people out of this land, that they

56
00:06:10,378 --> 00:06:21,664
 perish not; for Satan has great hold on the hearts of

57
00:06:21,664 --> 00:06:32,95
 the Amalekites, who do stir up the Lamanites to

58
00:06:32,95 --> 00:06:44,236
 anger against their brethren to slay them;

59
00:06:44,236 --> 00:06:55,522
 therefore get thee out of this land; and blessed are this

60
00:06:55,522 --> 00:07:06,808
 people in this generation, for I will preserve

61
00:07:06,808 --> 00:07:18,094
 them

62
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:24,171
13 And now it came to pass that Ammon went and

63
00:07:24,171 --> 00:07:29,504
 told the king all the words which the Lord had said

64
00:07:29,504 --> 00:07:34,837
 unto him

65
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:38,788
14 And they gathered together all their people,

66
00:07:38,788 --> 00:07:42,788
 yea, all the people of the Lord, and did gather

67
00:07:42,788 --> 00:07:46,788
 together all their flocks and herds, and departed out

68
00:07:46,788 --> 00:07:50,788
 of the land, and came into the wilderness which

69
00:07:50,788 --> 00:07:54,788
 divided the land of Nephi from the land of

70
00:07:54,788 --> 00:07:58,788
 Zarahemla, and came over near the borders of the land

71
00:07:58,712 --> 00:07:59,045
15 And it came to pass that Ammon said unto them:

72
00:07:59,045 --> 00:07:59,378
 Behold, I and my brethren will go forth into the

73
00:07:59,378 --> 00:07:59,711
 land of Zarahemla, and ye shall remain here until

74
00:07:59,711 --> 00:08:00,044
 we return; and we will try the hearts of our

75
00:08:00,044 --> 00:08:00,377
 brethren, whether they will that ye shall come into

76
00:08:00,377 --> 00:08:00,71
 their land

77
00:08:00,18 --> 00:08:03,18
16 And it came to pass that as Ammon was going

78
00:08:03,18 --> 00:08:06,18
 forth into the land, that he and his brethren met

79
00:08:06,18 --> 00:08:09,18
 Alma, over in the place of which has been spoken; and

80
00:08:09,18 --> 00:08:12,18
 behold, this was a joyful meeting

81
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:25,908
17 Now the joy of Ammon was so great even that he

82
00:08:25,908 --> 00:08:39,658
 was full; yea, he was swallowed up in the joy of

83
00:08:39,658 --> 00:08:53,408
 his God, even to the exhausting of his strength;

84
00:08:53,408 --> 00:09:07,158
 and he fell again to the earth

85
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:10,981
18 Now was not this exceeding joy? Behold, this is

86
00:09:10,981 --> 00:09:13,981
 joy which none receiveth save it be the truly

87
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:16,981
 penitent and humble seeker of happiness

88
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:35,772
19 Now the joy of Alma in meeting his brethren was

89
00:09:35,772 --> 00:09:55,522
 truly great, and also the joy of Aaron, of Omner,

90
00:09:55,522 --> 00:10:15,272
 and Himni; but behold their joy was not that to

91
00:10:15,272 --> 00:10:35,022
 exceed their strength

92
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:39,768
20 And now it came to pass that Alma conducted his

93
00:10:39,768 --> 00:10:43,768
 brethren back to the land of Zarahemla; even to

94
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:47,768
 his own house. And they went and told the chief

95
00:10:47,768 --> 00:10:51,768
 judge all the things that had happened unto them in

96
00:10:51,768 --> 00:10:55,768
 the land of Nephi, among their brethren, the

97
00:10:55,768 --> 00:10:59,768
 Lamanites

98
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:06,092
21 And it came to pass that the chief judge sent a

99
00:11:06,092 --> 00:11:12,492
 proclamation throughout all the land, desiring

100
00:11:12,492 --> 00:11:18,892
 the voice of the people concerning the admitting

101
00:11:18,892 --> 00:11:25,292
 their brethren, who were the people of

102
00:11:25,292 --> 00:11:31,692
 Anti-Nephi-Lehi

103
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:33,591
22 And it came to pass that the voice of the

104
00:11:33,591 --> 00:11:35,591
 people came, saying: Behold, we will give up the land

105
00:11:35,591 --> 00:11:37,591
 of Jershon, which is on the east by the sea, which

106
00:11:37,591 --> 00:11:39,591
 joins the land Bountiful, which is on the south of

107
00:11:39,591 --> 00:11:41,591
 the land Bountiful; and this land Jershon is the

108
00:11:41,591 --> 00:11:43,591
 land which we will give unto our brethren for an

109
00:11:43,591 --> 00:11:45,591
 inheritance

110
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,327
23 And behold, we will set our armies between the

111
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,216
 land Jershon and the land Nephi, that we may

112
00:11:49,216 --> 00:11:51,105
 protect our brethren in the land Jershon; and this we

113
00:11:51,105 --> 00:11:52,994
 do for our brethren, on account of their fear to

114
00:11:52,994 --> 00:11:54,883
 take up arms against their brethren lest they should

115
00:11:54,883 --> 00:11:56,772
 commit sin; and this their great fear came

116
00:11:56,772 --> 00:11:58,661
 because of their sore repentance which they had, on

117
00:11:58,661 --> 00:12:00,55
 account of their many murders and their awful

118
00:12:00,55 --> 00:12:02,439
 wickedness

119
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:10,122
24 And now behold, this will we do unto our

120
00:12:10,122 --> 00:12:17,455
 brethren, that they may inherit the land Jershon; and we

121
00:12:17,455 --> 00:12:24,788
 will guard them from their enemies with our

122
00:12:24,788 --> 00:12:32,121
 armies, on condition that they will give us a portion

123
00:12:32,121 --> 00:12:39,454
 of their substance to assist us that we may

124
00:12:39,454 --> 00:12:46,787
 maintain our armies

125
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:51,718
25 Now, it came to pass that when Ammon had heard

126
00:12:51,718 --> 00:12:57,004
 this, he returned to the people of

127
00:12:57,004 --> 00:13:02,29
 Anti-Nephi-Lehi, and also Alma with him, into the wilderness,

128
00:13:02,29 --> 00:13:07,576
 where they had pitched their tents, and made known

129
00:13:07,576 --> 00:13:12,862
 unto them all these things. And Alma also related

130
00:13:12,862 --> 00:13:18,148
 unto them his conversion, with Ammon and Aaron, and

131
00:13:18,148 --> 00:13:23,434
 his brethren

132
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:29,369
26 And it came to pass that it did cause great joy

133
00:13:29,369 --> 00:13:35,702
 among them. And they went down into the land of

134
00:13:35,702 --> 00:13:42,035
 Jershon, and took possession of the land of

135
00:13:42,035 --> 00:13:48,368
 Jershon; and they were called by the Nephites the people

136
00:13:48,368 --> 00:13:54,701
 of Ammon; therefore they were distinguished by

137
00:13:54,701 --> 00:14:01,034
 that name ever after

138
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:06,66
27 And they were among the people of Nephi, and

139
00:14:06,66 --> 00:14:11,946
 also numbered among the people who were of the

140
00:14:11,946 --> 00:14:17,232
 church of God. And they were also distinguished for

141
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:22,518
 their zeal towards God, and also towards men; for

142
00:14:22,518 --> 00:14:27,804
 they were perfectly honest and upright in all things;

143
00:14:27,804 --> 00:14:33,09
 and they were firm in the faith of Christ, even

144
00:14:33,09 --> 00:14:38,376
 unto the end

145
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:45,336
28 And they did look upon shedding the blood of

146
00:14:45,336 --> 00:14:51,961
 their brethren with the greatest abhorrence; and

147
00:14:51,961 --> 00:14:58,586
 they never could be prevailed upon to take up arms

148
00:14:58,586 --> 00:15:05,211
 against their brethren; and they never did look upon

149
00:15:05,211 --> 00:15:11,836
 death with any degree of terror, for their hope

150
00:15:11,836 --> 00:15:18,461
 and views of Christ and the resurrection;

151
00:15:18,461 --> 00:15:25,086
 therefore, death was swallowed up to them by the victory of

152
00:15:25,086 --> 00:15:31,711
 Christ over it
