1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:38,5
Chapter 33 Zenos taught that men should pray and

2
00:00:38,5 --> 00:01:17,0
 worship in all places, and that judgments are

3
00:01:17,0 --> 00:01:55,5
 turned away because of the Son—Zenock taught that mercy

4
00:01:55,5 --> 00:02:34,0
 is bestowed because of the Son—Moses had lifted

5
00:02:34,0 --> 00:03:12,5
 up in the wilderness a type of the Son of God.

6
00:03:12,5 --> 00:03:51,0
 About 74 B.C.

7
00:03:51,265 --> 00:03:58,265
1 Now after Alma had spoken these words, they sent

8
00:03:58,265 --> 00:04:05,265
 forth unto him desiring to know whether they

9
00:04:05,265 --> 00:04:12,265
 should believe in one God, that they might obtain this

10
00:04:12,265 --> 00:04:19,265
 fruit of which he had spoken, or how they should

11
00:04:19,265 --> 00:04:26,265
 plant the seed, or the word of which he had

12
00:04:26,265 --> 00:04:33,265
 spoken, which he said must be planted in their hearts;

13
00:04:33,265 --> 00:04:40,265
 or in what manner they should begin to exercise

14
00:04:40,265 --> 00:04:47,265
 their faith

15
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:57,23
2 And Alma said unto them: Behold, ye have said

16
00:04:57,23 --> 00:05:07,373
 that ye could not worship your God because ye are

17
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:17,516
 cast out of your synagogues. But behold, I say unto

18
00:05:17,516 --> 00:05:27,659
 you, if ye suppose that ye cannot worship God, ye

19
00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:37,802
 do greatly err, and ye ought to search the

20
00:05:37,802 --> 00:05:47,945
 scriptures; if ye suppose that they have taught you this,

21
00:05:47,945 --> 00:05:58,088
 ye do not understand them

22
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,526
3 Do ye remember to have read what Zenos, the

23
00:06:01,526 --> 00:06:04,193
 prophet of old, has said concerning prayer or worship

24
00:06:04,193 --> 00:06:06,86


25
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:14,834
4 For he said: Thou art merciful, O God, for thou

26
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:22,834
 hast heard my prayer, even when I was in the

27
00:06:22,834 --> 00:06:30,834
 wilderness; yea, thou wast merciful when I prayed

28
00:06:30,834 --> 00:06:38,834
 concerning those who were mine enemies, and thou didst

29
00:06:38,834 --> 00:06:46,834
 turn them to me

30
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:57,374
5 Yea, O God, and thou wast merciful unto me when

31
00:06:57,374 --> 00:07:08,041
 I did cry unto thee in my field; when I did cry

32
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:18,708
 unto thee in my prayer, and thou didst hear me

33
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:22,605
6 And again, O God, when I did turn to my house

34
00:07:22,605 --> 00:07:26,605
 thou didst hear me in my prayer

35
00:07:26,58 --> 00:07:30,58
7 And when I did turn unto my closet, O Lord, and

36
00:07:30,58 --> 00:07:34,58
 prayed unto thee, thou didst hear me

37
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:39,888
8 Yea, thou art merciful unto thy children when

38
00:07:39,888 --> 00:07:45,221
 they cry unto thee, to be heard of thee and not of

39
00:07:45,221 --> 00:07:50,554
 men, and thou wilt hear them

40
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:55,837
9 Yea, O God, thou hast been merciful unto me, and

41
00:07:55,837 --> 00:08:01,17
 heard my cries in the midst of thy congregations

42
00:08:01,17 --> 00:08:06,503


43
00:03:51,265 --> 00:04:09,932
12 And now Alma said unto them: Do ye believe

44
00:04:09,932 --> 00:04:28,599
 those scriptures which have been written by them of

45
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:47,266
 old

46
00:04:47,087 --> 00:05:17,42
13 Behold, if ye do, ye must believe what Zenos

47
00:05:17,42 --> 00:05:47,753
 said; for, behold he said: Thou hast turned away thy

48
00:05:47,753 --> 00:06:18,086
 judgments because of thy Son

49
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:24,879
14 Now behold, my brethren, I would ask if ye have

50
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:31,546
 read the scriptures? If ye have, how can ye

51
00:06:31,546 --> 00:06:38,213
 disbelieve on the Son of God

52
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:43,865
15 For it is not written that Zenos alone spake of

53
00:06:43,865 --> 00:06:49,532
 these things, but Zenock also spake of these

54
00:06:49,532 --> 00:06:55,199
 things

55
00:06:55,148 --> 00:07:01,148
16 For behold, he said: Thou art angry, O Lord,

56
00:07:01,148 --> 00:07:07,148
 with this people, because they will not understand

57
00:07:07,148 --> 00:07:13,148
 thy mercies which thou hast bestowed upon them

58
00:07:13,148 --> 00:07:19,148
 because of thy Son

59
00:07:19,94 --> 00:07:26,44
17 And now, my brethren, ye see that a second

60
00:07:26,44 --> 00:07:32,94
 prophet of old has testified of the Son of God, and

61
00:07:32,94 --> 00:07:39,44
 because the people would not understand his words

62
00:07:39,44 --> 00:07:45,94
 they stoned him to death

63
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:50,499
18 But behold, this is not all; these are not the

64
00:07:50,499 --> 00:07:55,499
 only ones who have spoken concerning the Son of

65
00:07:55,499 --> 00:08:00,499
 God

66
00:03:51,265 --> 00:04:00,598
21 O my brethren, if ye could be healed by merely

67
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:09,931
 casting about your eyes that ye might be healed,

68
00:04:09,931 --> 00:04:19,264
 would ye not behold quickly, or would ye rather

69
00:04:19,264 --> 00:04:28,597
 harden your hearts in unbelief, and be slothful, that

70
00:04:28,597 --> 00:04:37,93
 ye would not cast about your eyes, that ye might

71
00:04:37,93 --> 00:04:47,263
 perish

72
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:54,976
22 If so, wo shall come upon you; but if not so,

73
00:04:54,976 --> 00:05:02,865
 then cast about your eyes and begin to believe in

74
00:05:02,865 --> 00:05:10,754
 the Son of God, that he will come to redeem his

75
00:05:10,754 --> 00:05:18,643
 people, and that he shall suffer and die to atone for

76
00:05:18,643 --> 00:05:26,532
 their sins; and that he shall rise again from the

77
00:05:26,532 --> 00:05:34,421
 dead, which shall bring to pass the resurrection,

78
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:42,31
 that all men shall stand before him, to be judged

79
00:05:42,31 --> 00:05:50,199
 at the last and judgment day, according to their

80
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:58,088
 works

81
00:05:58,859 --> 00:05:58,984
23 And now, my brethren, I desire that ye shall

82
00:05:58,984 --> 00:05:59,109
 plant this word in your hearts, and as it beginneth

83
00:05:59,109 --> 00:05:59,234
 to swell even so nourish it by your faith. And

84
00:05:59,234 --> 00:05:59,359
 behold, it will become a tree, springing up in you

85
00:05:59,359 --> 00:05:59,484
 unto everlasting life. And then may God grant unto

86
00:05:59,484 --> 00:05:59,609
 you that your burdens may be light, through the joy

87
00:05:59,609 --> 00:05:59,734
 of his Son. And even all this can ye do if ye

88
00:05:59,734 --> 00:05:59,859
 will. Amen.
