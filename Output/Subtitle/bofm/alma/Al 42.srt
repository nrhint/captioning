1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:03,875
Chapter 42 Mortality is a probationary time to

2
00:00:03,875 --> 00:00:07,75
 enable man to repent and serve God—The Fall brought

3
00:00:07,75 --> 00:00:11,625
 temporal and spiritual death upon all

4
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:15,5
 mankind—Redemption comes through repentance—God Himself atones

5
00:00:15,5 --> 00:00:19,375
 for the sins of the world—Mercy is for those who

6
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:23,25
 repent—All others are subject to God’s

7
00:00:23,25 --> 00:00:27,125
 justice—Mercy comes because of the Atonement—Only the truly

8
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:31,0
 penitent are saved. About 74 B.C.

9
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:46,899
1 And now, my son, I perceive there is somewhat

10
00:00:46,899 --> 00:01:01,899
 more which doth worry your mind, which ye cannot

11
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:16,899
 understand—which is concerning the justice of God in

12
00:01:16,899 --> 00:01:31,899
 the punishment of the sinner; for ye do try to

13
00:01:31,899 --> 00:01:46,899
 suppose that it is injustice that the sinner should

14
00:01:46,899 --> 00:02:01,899
 be consigned to a state of misery

15
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:10,139
2 Now behold, my son, I will explain this thing

16
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:18,389
 unto thee. For behold, after the Lord God sent our

17
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:26,639
 first parents forth from the garden of Eden, to

18
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:34,889
 till the ground, from whence they were taken—yea, he

19
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:43,139
 drew out the man, and he placed at the east end of

20
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:51,389
 the garden of Eden, cherubim, and a flaming sword

21
00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:59,639
 which turned every way, to keep the tree of life

22
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:07,889


23
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:11,988
3 Now, we see that the man had become as God,

24
00:03:11,988 --> 00:03:16,155
 knowing good and evil; and lest he should put forth

25
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:20,322
 his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat

26
00:03:20,322 --> 00:03:24,489
 and live forever, the Lord God placed cherubim

27
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:28,656
 and the flaming sword, that he should not partake of

28
00:03:28,656 --> 00:03:32,823
 the fruit

29
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:39,779
4 And thus we see, that there was a time granted

30
00:03:39,779 --> 00:03:47,112
 unto man to repent, yea, a probationary time, a

31
00:03:47,112 --> 00:03:54,445
 time to repent and serve God

32
00:03:54,434 --> 00:04:24,934
5 For behold, if Adam had put forth his hand

33
00:04:24,934 --> 00:04:55,434
 immediately, and partaken of the tree of life, he would

34
00:04:55,434 --> 00:05:25,934
 have lived forever, according to the word of God,

35
00:05:25,934 --> 00:05:56,434
 having no space for repentance; yea, and also the

36
00:05:56,434 --> 00:06:26,934
 word of God would have been void, and the great

37
00:06:26,934 --> 00:06:57,434
 plan of salvation would have been frustrated

38
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:59,451
6 But behold, it was appointed unto man to

39
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:01,051
 die—therefore, as they were cut off from the tree of life

40
00:07:01,051 --> 00:07:02,651
 they should be cut off from the face of the

41
00:07:02,651 --> 00:07:04,251
 earth—and man became lost forever, yea, they became

42
00:07:04,251 --> 00:07:05,851
 fallen man

43
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:17,826
7 And now, ye see by this that our first parents

44
00:07:17,826 --> 00:07:29,826
 were cut off both temporally and spiritually from

45
00:07:29,826 --> 00:07:41,826
 the presence of the Lord; and thus we see they

46
00:07:41,826 --> 00:07:53,826
 became subjects to follow after their own will

47
00:07:53,674 --> 00:08:04,341
8 Now behold, it was not expedient that man should

48
00:08:04,341 --> 00:08:15,008
 be reclaimed from this temporal death, for that

49
00:08:15,008 --> 00:08:25,675
 would destroy the great plan of happiness

50
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:34,905
9 Therefore, as the soul could never die, and the

51
00:08:34,905 --> 00:08:44,238
 fall had brought upon all mankind a spiritual

52
00:08:44,238 --> 00:08:53,571
 death as well as a temporal, that is, they were cut

53
00:08:53,571 --> 00:09:02,904
 off from the presence of the Lord, it was expedient

54
00:09:02,904 --> 00:09:12,237
 that mankind should be reclaimed from this

55
00:09:12,237 --> 00:09:21,57
 spiritual death

56
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:31,395
10 Therefore, as they had become carnal, sensual,

57
00:09:31,395 --> 00:09:41,395
 and devilish, by nature, this probationary state

58
00:09:41,395 --> 00:09:51,395
 became a state for them to prepare; it became a

59
00:09:51,395 --> 00:10:01,395
 preparatory state

60
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:09,268
11 And now remember, my son, if it were not for

61
00:10:09,268 --> 00:10:17,268
 the plan of redemption, (laying it aside) as soon as

62
00:10:17,268 --> 00:10:25,268
 they were dead their souls were miserable, being

63
00:10:25,268 --> 00:10:33,268
 cut off from the presence of the Lord

64
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:49,166
12 And now, there was no means to reclaim men from

65
00:10:49,166 --> 00:11:05,166
 this fallen state, which man had brought upon

66
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:21,166
 himself because of his own disobedience

67
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:32,889
13 Therefore, according to justice, the plan of

68
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:44,764
 redemption could not be brought about, only on

69
00:11:44,764 --> 00:11:56,639
 conditions of repentance of men in this probationary

70
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:08,514
 state, yea, this preparatory state; for except it

71
00:12:08,514 --> 00:12:20,389
 were for these conditions, mercy could not take

72
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:32,264
 effect except it should destroy the work of justice.

73
00:12:32,264 --> 00:12:44,139
 Now the work of justice could not be destroyed; if

74
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:56,014
 so, God would cease to be God

75
00:12:56,71 --> 00:13:04,71
14 And thus we see that all mankind were fallen,

76
00:13:04,71 --> 00:13:12,71
 and they were in the grasp of justice; yea, the

77
00:13:12,71 --> 00:13:20,71
 justice of God, which consigned them forever to be

78
00:13:20,71 --> 00:13:28,71
 cut off from his presence

79
00:13:28,609 --> 00:13:48,609
15 And now, the plan of mercy could not be brought

80
00:13:48,609 --> 00:14:08,609
 about except an atonement should be made;

81
00:14:08,609 --> 00:14:28,609
 therefore God himself atoneth for the sins of the world,

82
00:14:28,609 --> 00:14:48,609
 to bring about the plan of mercy, to appease the

83
00:14:48,609 --> 00:15:08,609
 demands of justice, that God might be a perfect,

84
00:15:08,609 --> 00:15:28,609
 just God, and a merciful God also

85
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:37,828
16 Now, repentance could not come unto men except

86
00:15:37,828 --> 00:15:47,428
 there were a punishment, which also was eternal as

87
00:15:47,428 --> 00:15:57,028
 the life of the soul should be, affixed opposite

88
00:15:57,028 --> 00:16:06,628
 to the plan of happiness, which was as eternal

89
00:16:06,628 --> 00:16:16,228
 also as the life of the soul

90
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:29,076
17 Now, how could a man repent except he should

91
00:16:29,076 --> 00:16:42,076
 sin? How could he sin if there was no law? How could

92
00:16:42,076 --> 00:16:55,076
 there be a law save there was a punishment

93
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:58,616
18 Now, there was a punishment affixed, and a just

94
00:16:58,616 --> 00:17:01,283
 law given, which brought remorse of conscience

95
00:17:01,283 --> 00:17:03,95
 unto man

96
00:00:31,899 --> 00:01:09,232
21 And if there was no law given, if men sinned

97
00:01:09,232 --> 00:01:46,565
 what could justice do, or mercy either, for they

98
00:01:46,565 --> 00:02:23,898
 would have no claim upon the creature

99
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:58,83
22 But there is a law given, and a punishment

100
00:02:58,83 --> 00:03:34,116
 affixed, and a repentance granted; which repentance,

101
00:03:34,116 --> 00:04:09,402
 mercy claimeth; otherwise, justice claimeth the

102
00:04:09,402 --> 00:04:44,688
 creature and executeth the law, and the law

103
00:04:44,688 --> 00:05:19,974
 inflicteth the punishment; if not so, the works of justice

104
00:05:19,974 --> 00:05:55,26
 would be destroyed, and God would cease to be God

105
00:05:55,26 --> 00:06:30,546


106
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:33,757
23 But God ceaseth not to be God, and mercy

107
00:06:33,757 --> 00:06:36,757
 claimeth the penitent, and mercy cometh because of the

108
00:06:36,757 --> 00:06:39,757
 atonement; and the atonement bringeth to pass the

109
00:06:39,757 --> 00:06:42,757
 resurrection of the dead; and the resurrection of

110
00:06:42,757 --> 00:06:45,757
 the dead bringeth back men into the presence of

111
00:06:45,757 --> 00:06:48,757
 God; and thus they are restored into his presence, to

112
00:06:48,757 --> 00:06:51,757
 be judged according to their works, according to

113
00:06:51,757 --> 00:06:54,757
 the law and justice

114
00:06:54,681 --> 00:07:00,014
24 For behold, justice exerciseth all his demands,

115
00:07:00,014 --> 00:07:05,347
 and also mercy claimeth all which is her own; and

116
00:07:05,347 --> 00:07:10,68
 thus, none but the truly penitent are saved

117
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:15,964
25 What, do ye suppose that mercy can rob justice?

118
00:07:15,964 --> 00:07:21,297
 I say unto you, Nay; not one whit. If so, God

119
00:07:21,297 --> 00:07:26,63
 would cease to be God

120
00:07:26,58 --> 00:07:29,78
26 And thus God bringeth about his great and

121
00:07:29,78 --> 00:07:32,98
 eternal purposes, which were prepared from the

122
00:07:32,98 --> 00:07:36,18
 foundation of the world. And thus cometh about the

123
00:07:36,18 --> 00:07:39,38
 salvation and the redemption of men, and also their

124
00:07:39,38 --> 00:07:42,58
 destruction and misery

125
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:44,129
27 Therefore, O my son, whosoever will come may

126
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:45,729
 come and partake of the waters of life freely; and

127
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:47,329
 whosoever will not come the same is not compelled

128
00:07:47,329 --> 00:07:48,929
 to come; but in the last day it shall be restored

129
00:07:48,929 --> 00:07:50,529
 unto him according to his deeds

130
00:07:50,504 --> 00:08:06,504
28 If he has desired to do evil, and has not

131
00:08:06,504 --> 00:08:22,504
 repented in his days, behold, evil shall be done unto

132
00:08:22,504 --> 00:08:38,504
 him, according to the restoration of God

133
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:50,352
29 And now, my son, I desire that ye should let

134
00:08:50,352 --> 00:09:02,352
 these things trouble you no more, and only let your

135
00:09:02,352 --> 00:09:14,352
 sins trouble you, with that trouble which shall

136
00:09:14,352 --> 00:09:26,352
 bring you down unto repentance

137
00:09:26,2 --> 00:09:31,914
30 O my son, I desire that ye should deny the

138
00:09:31,914 --> 00:09:37,628
 justice of God no more. Do not endeavor to excuse

139
00:09:37,628 --> 00:09:43,342
 yourself in the least point because of your sins, by

140
00:09:43,342 --> 00:09:49,056
 denying the justice of God; but do you let the

141
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:54,77
 justice of God, and his mercy, and his long-suffering

142
00:09:54,77 --> 00:10:00,484
 have full sway in your heart; and let it bring you

143
00:10:00,484 --> 00:10:06,198
 down to the dust in humility

144
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:06,073
31 And now, O my son, ye are called of God to

145
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:06,073
 preach the word unto this people. And now, my son, go

146
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:06,073
 thy way, declare the word with truth and

147
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:06,073
 soberness, that thou mayest bring souls unto repentance,

148
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:06,073
 that the great plan of mercy may have claim upon

149
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:06,073
 them. And may God grant unto you even according to my

150
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:06,073
 words. Amen.
