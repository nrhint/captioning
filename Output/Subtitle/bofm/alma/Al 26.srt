00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:12,0
Chapter 26 Ammon glories in the Lord—The faithful

2
00:00:12,0 --> 00:00:24,0
 are strengthened by the Lord and are given

3
00:00:24,0 --> 00:00:36,0
 knowledge—By faith men may bring thousands of souls unto

4
00:00:36,0 --> 00:00:48,0
 repentance—God has all power and comprehends all

5
00:00:48,0 --> 00:01:00,0
 things. About 90–77 B.C.

6
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:01,96
1 And now, these are the words of Ammon to his

7
00:01:01,96 --> 00:01:03,293
 brethren, which say thus: My brothers and my

8
00:01:03,293 --> 00:01:04,626
 brethren, behold I say unto you, how great reason have we

9
00:01:04,626 --> 00:01:05,959
 to rejoice; for could we have supposed when we

10
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:07,292
 started from the land of Zarahemla that God would

11
00:01:07,292 --> 00:01:08,625
 have granted unto us such great blessings

12
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:26,602
2 And now, I ask, what great blessings has he

13
00:01:26,602 --> 00:01:44,602
 bestowed upon us? Can ye tell

14
00:01:44,404 --> 00:02:07,118
3 Behold, I answer for you; for our brethren, the

15
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:29,832
 Lamanites, were in darkness, yea, even in the

16
00:02:29,832 --> 00:02:52,546
 darkest abyss, but behold, how many of them are

17
00:02:52,546 --> 00:03:15,26
 brought to behold the marvelous light of God! And this

18
00:03:15,26 --> 00:03:37,974
 is the blessing which hath been bestowed upon us,

19
00:03:37,974 --> 00:04:00,688
 that we have been made instruments in the hands of

20
00:04:00,688 --> 00:04:23,402
 God to bring about this great work

21
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:27,897
4 Behold, thousands of them do rejoice, and have

22
00:04:27,897 --> 00:04:31,897
 been brought into the fold of God

23
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:41,205
5 Behold, the field was ripe, and blessed are ye,

24
00:04:41,205 --> 00:04:50,538
 for ye did thrust in the sickle, and did reap with

25
00:04:50,538 --> 00:04:59,871
 your might, yea, all the day long did ye labor;

26
00:04:59,871 --> 00:05:09,204
 and behold the number of your sheaves! And they

27
00:05:09,204 --> 00:05:18,537
 shall be gathered into the garners, that they are not

28
00:05:18,537 --> 00:05:27,87
 wasted

29
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:31,123
6 Yea, they shall not be beaten down by the storm

30
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:34,552
 at the last day; yea, neither shall they be

31
00:05:34,552 --> 00:05:37,981
 harrowed up by the whirlwinds; but when the storm cometh

32
00:05:37,981 --> 00:05:41,41
 they shall be gathered together in their place,

33
00:05:41,41 --> 00:05:44,839
 that the storm cannot penetrate to them; yea,

34
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:48,268
 neither shall they be driven with fierce winds

35
00:05:48,268 --> 00:05:51,697
 whithersoever the enemy listeth to carry them

36
00:05:51,618 --> 00:06:23,618
7 But behold, they are in the hands of the Lord of

37
00:06:23,618 --> 00:06:55,618
 the harvest, and they are his; and he will raise

38
00:06:55,618 --> 00:07:27,618
 them up at the last day

39
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:29,981
8 Blessed be the name of our God; let us sing to

40
00:07:29,981 --> 00:07:32,648
 his praise, yea, let us give thanks to his holy

41
00:07:32,648 --> 00:07:35,315
 name, for he doth work righteousness forever

42
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:40,088
9 For if we had not come up out of the land of

43
00:07:40,088 --> 00:07:44,888
 Zarahemla, these our dearly beloved brethren, who

44
00:07:44,888 --> 00:07:49,688
 have so dearly beloved us, would still have been

45
00:07:49,688 --> 00:07:54,488
 racked with hatred against us, yea, and they would

46
00:07:54,488 --> 00:07:59,288
 also have been strangers to God

47
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:07,212
10 And it came to pass that when Ammon had said

48
00:08:07,212 --> 00:08:15,212
 these words, his brother Aaron rebuked him, saying:

49
00:08:15,212 --> 00:08:23,212
 Ammon, I fear that thy joy doth carry thee away

50
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:31,212
 unto boasting

51
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:40,861
11 But Ammon said unto him: I do not boast in my

52
00:08:40,861 --> 00:08:50,611
 own strength, nor in my own wisdom; but behold, my

53
00:08:50,611 --> 00:09:00,361
 joy is full, yea, my heart is brim with joy, and I

54
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:10,111
 will rejoice in my God

55
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:20,317
12 Yea, I know that I am nothing; as to my

56
00:09:20,317 --> 00:09:29,65
 strength I am weak; therefore I will not boast of myself,

57
00:09:29,65 --> 00:09:38,983
 but I will boast of my God, for in his strength I

58
00:09:38,983 --> 00:09:48,316
 can do all things; yea, behold, many mighty

59
00:09:48,316 --> 00:09:57,649
 miracles we have wrought in this land, for which we

60
00:09:57,649 --> 00:10:06,982
 will praise his name forever

61
00:10:06,806 --> 00:11:52,206
13 Behold, how many thousands of our brethren has

62
00:11:52,206 --> 00:13:37,606
 he loosed from the pains of hell; and they are

63
00:13:37,606 --> 00:15:23,006
 brought to sing redeeming love, and this because of

64
00:15:23,006 --> 00:17:08,406
 the power of his word which is in us, therefore

65
00:17:08,406 --> 00:18:53,806
 have we not great reason to rejoice

66
00:18:53,132 --> 00:19:03,799
14 Yea, we have reason to praise him forever, for

67
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:14,466
 he is the Most High God, and has loosed our

68
00:19:14,466 --> 00:19:25,133
 brethren from the chains of hell

69
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:35,174
15 Yea, they were encircled about with everlasting

70
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:45,317
 darkness and destruction; but behold, he has

71
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:55,46
 brought them into his everlasting light, yea, into

72
00:19:55,46 --> 00:20:05,603
 everlasting salvation; and they are encircled about

73
00:20:05,603 --> 00:20:15,746
 with the matchless bounty of his love; yea, and we

74
00:20:15,746 --> 00:20:25,889
 have been instruments in his hands of doing this

75
00:20:25,889 --> 00:20:36,032
 great and marvelous work

76
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:37,802
16 Therefore, let us glory, yea, we will glory in

77
00:20:37,802 --> 00:20:38,802
 the Lord; yea, we will rejoice, for our joy is

78
00:20:38,802 --> 00:20:39,802
 full; yea, we will praise our God forever. Behold,

79
00:20:39,802 --> 00:20:40,802
 who can glory too much in the Lord? Yea, who can say

80
00:20:40,802 --> 00:20:41,802
 too much of his great power, and of his mercy,

81
00:20:41,802 --> 00:20:42,802
 and of his long-suffering towards the children of

82
00:20:42,802 --> 00:20:43,802
 men? Behold, I say unto you, I cannot say the

83
00:20:43,802 --> 00:20:44,802
 smallest part which I feel

84
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:47,444
17 Who could have supposed that our God would have

85
00:20:47,444 --> 00:20:50,111
 been so merciful as to have snatched us from our

86
00:20:50,111 --> 00:20:52,778
 awful, sinful, and polluted state

87
00:20:52,752 --> 00:21:16,752
18 Behold, we went forth even in wrath, with

88
00:21:16,752 --> 00:21:40,752
 mighty threatenings to destroy his church

89
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:42,599
19 Oh then, why did he not consign us to an awful

90
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:44,599
 destruction, yea, why did he not let the sword of

91
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:46,599
 his justice fall upon us, and doom us to eternal

92
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:48,599
 despair

93
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:58,174
20 Oh, my soul, almost as it were, fleeth at the

94
00:21:58,174 --> 00:22:07,774
 thought. Behold, he did not exercise his justice

95
00:22:07,774 --> 00:22:17,374
 upon us, but in his great mercy hath brought us over

96
00:22:17,374 --> 00:22:26,974
 that everlasting gulf of death and misery, even

97
00:22:26,974 --> 00:22:36,574
 to the salvation of our souls

98
00:01:51,645 --> 00:02:29,645
23 Now do ye remember, my brethren, that we said

99
00:02:29,645 --> 00:03:07,645
 unto our brethren in the land of Zarahemla, we go

100
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:45,645
 up to the land of Nephi, to preach unto our

101
00:03:45,645 --> 00:04:23,645
 brethren, the Lamanites, and they laughed us to scorn

102
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:41,463
24 For they said unto us: Do ye suppose that ye

103
00:04:41,463 --> 00:04:59,763
 can bring the Lamanites to the knowledge of the

104
00:04:59,763 --> 00:05:18,063
 truth? Do ye suppose that ye can convince the

105
00:05:18,063 --> 00:05:36,363
 Lamanites of the incorrectness of the traditions of their

106
00:05:36,363 --> 00:05:54,663
 fathers, as stiffnecked a people as they are;

107
00:05:54,663 --> 00:06:12,963
 whose hearts delight in the shedding of blood; whose

108
00:06:12,963 --> 00:06:31,263
 days have been spent in the grossest iniquity;

109
00:06:31,263 --> 00:06:49,563
 whose ways have been the ways of a transgressor from

110
00:06:49,563 --> 00:07:07,863
 the beginning? Now my brethren, ye remember that

111
00:07:07,863 --> 00:07:26,163
 this was their language

112
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,579
25 And moreover they did say: Let us take up arms

113
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:30,579
 against them, that we destroy them and their

114
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:32,579
 iniquity out of the land, lest they overrun us and

115
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:34,579
 destroy us

116
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:38,554
26 But behold, my beloved brethren, we came into

117
00:07:38,554 --> 00:07:42,554
 the wilderness not with the intent to destroy our

118
00:07:42,554 --> 00:07:46,554
 brethren, but with the intent that perhaps we might

119
00:07:46,554 --> 00:07:50,554
 save some few of their souls

120
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:52,103
27 Now when our hearts were depressed, and we were

121
00:07:52,103 --> 00:07:53,703
 about to turn back, behold, the Lord comforted

122
00:07:53,703 --> 00:07:55,303
 us, and said: Go amongst thy brethren, the

123
00:07:55,303 --> 00:07:56,903
 Lamanites, and bear with patience thine afflictions, and I

124
00:07:56,903 --> 00:07:58,503
 will give unto you success

125
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:15,811
28 And now behold, we have come, and been forth

126
00:08:15,811 --> 00:08:33,144
 amongst them; and we have been patient in our

127
00:08:33,144 --> 00:08:50,477
 sufferings, and we have suffered every privation; yea,

128
00:08:50,477 --> 00:09:07,81
 we have traveled from house to house, relying upon

129
00:09:07,81 --> 00:09:25,143
 the mercies of the world—not upon the mercies of

130
00:09:25,143 --> 00:09:42,476
 the world alone but upon the mercies of God

131
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,748
29 And we have entered into their houses and

132
00:09:43,748 --> 00:09:45,348
 taught them, and we have taught them in their streets;

133
00:09:45,348 --> 00:09:46,948
 yea, and we have taught them upon their hills; and

134
00:09:46,948 --> 00:09:48,548
 we have also entered into their temples and their

135
00:09:48,548 --> 00:09:50,148
 synagogues and taught them; and we have been cast

136
00:09:50,148 --> 00:09:51,748
 out, and mocked, and spit upon, and smote upon

137
00:09:51,748 --> 00:09:53,348
 our cheeks; and we have been stoned, and taken and

138
00:09:53,348 --> 00:09:54,948
 bound with strong cords, and cast into prison; and

139
00:09:54,948 --> 00:09:56,548
 through the power and wisdom of God we have been

140
00:09:56,548 --> 00:09:58,148
 delivered again

141
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,698
30 And we have suffered all manner of afflictions,

142
00:09:59,698 --> 00:10:01,298
 and all this, that perhaps we might be the means

143
00:10:01,298 --> 00:10:02,898
 of saving some soul; and we supposed that our joy

144
00:10:02,898 --> 00:10:04,498
 would be full if perhaps we could be the means of

145
00:10:04,498 --> 00:10:06,098
 saving some

146
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:09,272
31 Now behold, we can look forth and see the

147
00:10:09,272 --> 00:10:12,472
 fruits of our labors; and are they few? I say unto you,

148
00:10:12,472 --> 00:10:15,672
 Nay, they are many; yea, and we can witness of

149
00:10:15,672 --> 00:10:18,872
 their sincerity, because of their love towards their

150
00:10:18,872 --> 00:10:22,072
 brethren and also towards us

151
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,421
32 For behold, they had rather sacrifice their

152
00:10:23,421 --> 00:10:24,821
 lives than even to take the life of their enemy; and

153
00:10:24,821 --> 00:10:26,221
 they have buried their weapons of war deep in the

154
00:10:26,221 --> 00:10:27,621
 earth, because of their love towards their

155
00:10:27,621 --> 00:10:29,021
 brethren

156
00:10:29,996 --> 00:13:20,329
33 And now behold I say unto you, has there been

157
00:13:20,329 --> 00:16:10,662
 so great love in all the land? Behold, I say unto

158
00:16:10,662 --> 00:19:00,995
 you, Nay, there has not, even among the Nephites

159
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:22,04
34 For behold, they would take up arms against

160
00:19:22,04 --> 00:19:43,707
 their brethren; they would not suffer themselves to

161
00:19:43,707 --> 00:20:05,374
 be slain. But behold how many of these have laid

162
00:20:05,374 --> 00:20:27,041
 down their lives; and we know that they have gone to

163
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:48,708
 their God, because of their love and of their

164
00:20:48,708 --> 00:21:10,375
 hatred to sin

165
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:15,477
35 Now have we not reason to rejoice? Yea, I say

166
00:21:15,477 --> 00:21:20,852
 unto you, there never were men that had so great

167
00:21:20,852 --> 00:21:26,227
 reason to rejoice as we, since the world began; yea,

168
00:21:26,227 --> 00:21:31,602
 and my joy is carried away, even unto boasting in

169
00:21:31,602 --> 00:21:36,977
 my God; for he has all power, all wisdom, and all

170
00:21:36,977 --> 00:21:42,352
 understanding; he comprehendeth all things, and

171
00:21:42,352 --> 00:21:47,727
 he is a merciful Being, even unto salvation, to

172
00:21:47,727 --> 00:21:53,102
 those who will repent and believe on his name

173
00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:59,469
36 Now if this is boasting, even so will I boast;

174
00:21:59,469 --> 00:22:05,025
 for this is my life and my light, my joy and my

175
00:22:05,025 --> 00:22:10,581
 salvation, and my redemption from everlasting wo.

176
00:22:10,581 --> 00:22:16,137
 Yea, blessed is the name of my God, who has been

177
00:22:16,137 --> 00:22:21,693
 mindful of this people, who are a branch of the tree

178
00:22:21,693 --> 00:22:27,249
 of Israel, and has been lost from its body in a

179
00:22:27,249 --> 00:22:32,805
 strange land; yea, I say, blessed be the name of my

180
00:22:32,805 --> 00:22:38,361
 God, who has been mindful of us, wanderers in a

181
00:22:38,361 --> 00:22:43,917
 strange land

182
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:43,929
37 Now my brethren, we see that God is mindful of

183
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:44,096
 every people, whatsoever land they may be in; yea,

184
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:44,263
 he numbereth his people, and his bowels of mercy

185
00:22:44,263 --> 00:22:44,43
 are over all the earth. Now this is my joy, and my

186
00:22:44,43 --> 00:22:44,597
 great thanksgiving; yea, and I will give thanks

187
00:22:44,597 --> 00:22:44,764
 unto my God forever. Amen.
