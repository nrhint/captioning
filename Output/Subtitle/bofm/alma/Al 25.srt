00:00:00,0 --> 00:01:02,2
Chapter 25 Lamanite aggressions spread—The seed of

2
00:01:02,2 --> 00:02:04,4
 the priests of Noah perish as Abinadi

3
00:02:04,4 --> 00:03:06,6
 prophesied—Many Lamanites are converted and join the people

4
00:03:06,6 --> 00:04:08,8
 of Anti-Nephi-Lehi—They believe in Christ and keep

5
00:04:08,8 --> 00:05:11,0
 the law of Moses. About 90–77 B.C.

6
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:18,811
1 And behold, now it came to pass that those

7
00:05:18,811 --> 00:05:26,611
 Lamanites were more angry because they had slain their

8
00:05:26,611 --> 00:05:34,411
 brethren; therefore they swore vengeance upon the

9
00:05:34,411 --> 00:05:42,211
 Nephites; and they did no more attempt to slay the

10
00:05:42,211 --> 00:05:50,011
 people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi at that time

11
00:05:50,884 --> 00:06:26,884
2 But they took their armies and went over into

12
00:06:26,884 --> 00:07:02,884
 the borders of the land of Zarahemla, and fell upon

13
00:07:02,884 --> 00:07:38,884
 the people who were in the land of Ammonihah and

14
00:07:38,884 --> 00:08:14,884
 destroyed them

15
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:38,428
3 And after that, they had many battles with the

16
00:08:38,428 --> 00:09:02,428
 Nephites, in the which they were driven and slain

17
00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:06,276
4 And among the Lamanites who were slain were

18
00:09:06,276 --> 00:09:10,276
 almost all the seed of Amulon and his brethren, who

19
00:09:10,276 --> 00:09:14,276
 were the priests of Noah, and they were slain by the

20
00:09:14,276 --> 00:09:18,276
 hands of the Nephites

21
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:20,761
7 And it came to pass that those rulers who were

22
00:05:20,761 --> 00:05:30,511
 the remnant of the children of Amulon caused that

23
00:05:30,511 --> 00:05:40,261
 they should be put to death, yea, all those that

24
00:05:40,261 --> 00:05:50,011
 believed in these things

25
00:05:50,884 --> 00:06:14,884
8 Now this martyrdom caused that many of their

26
00:06:14,884 --> 00:06:38,884
 brethren should be stirred up to anger; and there

27
00:06:38,884 --> 00:07:02,884
 began to be contention in the wilderness; and the

28
00:07:02,884 --> 00:07:26,884
 Lamanites began to hunt the seed of Amulon and his

29
00:07:26,884 --> 00:07:50,884
 brethren and began to slay them; and they fled into

30
00:07:50,884 --> 00:08:14,884
 the east wilderness

31
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:24,028
9 And behold they are hunted at this day by the

32
00:08:24,028 --> 00:08:33,628
 Lamanites. Thus the words of Abinadi were brought to

33
00:08:33,628 --> 00:08:43,228
 pass, which he said concerning the seed of the

34
00:08:43,228 --> 00:08:52,828
 priests who caused that he should suffer death by

35
00:08:52,828 --> 00:09:02,428
 fire

36
00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:10,276
10 For he said unto them: What ye shall do unto me

37
00:09:10,276 --> 00:09:18,276
 shall be a type of things to come

38
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:16,582
13 And it came to pass that when the Lamanites saw

39
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:22,153
 that they could not overpower the Nephites they

40
00:05:22,153 --> 00:05:27,724
 returned again to their own land; and many of them

41
00:05:27,724 --> 00:05:33,295
 came over to dwell in the land of Ishmael and the

42
00:05:33,295 --> 00:05:38,866
 land of Nephi, and did join themselves to the

43
00:05:38,866 --> 00:05:44,437
 people of God, who were the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi

44
00:05:44,437 --> 00:05:50,008


45
00:05:50,884 --> 00:06:19,684
14 And they did also bury their weapons of war,

46
00:06:19,684 --> 00:06:48,484
 according as their brethren had, and they began to

47
00:06:48,484 --> 00:07:17,284
 be a righteous people; and they did walk in the

48
00:07:17,284 --> 00:07:46,084
 ways of the Lord, and did observe to keep his

49
00:07:46,084 --> 00:08:14,884
 commandments and his statutes

50
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:18,317
15 Yea, and they did keep the law of Moses; for it

51
00:08:18,317 --> 00:08:22,206
 was expedient that they should keep the law of

52
00:08:22,206 --> 00:08:26,095
 Moses as yet, for it was not all fulfilled. But

53
00:08:26,095 --> 00:08:29,984
 notwithstanding the law of Moses, they did look

54
00:08:29,984 --> 00:08:33,873
 forward to the coming of Christ, considering that the

55
00:08:33,873 --> 00:08:37,762
 law of Moses was a type of his coming, and believing

56
00:08:37,762 --> 00:08:41,651
 that they must keep those outward performances

57
00:08:41,651 --> 00:08:45,54
 until the time that he should be revealed unto them

58
00:08:45,54 --> 00:08:49,429
