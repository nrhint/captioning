1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
The Book of Alma the Son of AlmaThe account of

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Alma, who was the son of Alma, the first and

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
chief judge over the people of Nephi, and also the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
high priest over the Church. An account of the

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
reign of the judges, and the wars and contentions

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
among the people. And also an account of a war

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
between the Nephites and the Lamanites, according

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
to the record of Alma, the first and chief

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
judge.Chapter 1 Nehor teaches false doctrines,

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
establishes a church, introduces priestcraft, and

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
slays Gideon—Nehor is executed for his

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
crimes—Priestcrafts and persecutions spread among the

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
people—The priests support themselves, the people care

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:14:38,
for the poor, and the Church prospers. About 91–88 B.C. 

15
00:14:38,0 --> 00:14:38,0
1 Now it came to pass that in the first year

16
00:14:38,0 --> 00:14:38,0
of the reign of the judges over the people of

17
00:14:38,0 --> 00:14:38,0
Nephi, from this time forward, king Mosiah

18
00:14:38,0 --> 00:14:38,0
having gone the way of all the earth, having

19
00:14:38,0 --> 00:14:38,0
warred a good warfare, walking uprightly before

20
00:14:38,0 --> 00:14:38,0
God, leaving none to reign in his stead;

21
00:14:38,0 --> 00:14:38,0
nevertheless he had established laws, and they were

22
00:14:38,0 --> 00:14:38,0
acknowledged by the people; therefore they were

23
00:14:38,0 --> 00:17:34,
obliged to abide by the laws which he had made.

24
00:17:34,0 --> 00:17:34,0
2 And it came to pass that in the

25
00:17:34,0 --> 00:17:34,0
first year of the reign of Alma in the

26
00:17:34,0 --> 00:17:34,0
judgment-seat, there was a man brought

27
00:17:34,0 --> 00:17:34,0
before him to be judged, a man who was

28
00:17:34,0 --> 00:23:44,
large, and was noted for his much strength.

29
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
3 And he had gone about among the

30
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
people, preaching to them that

31
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
which he termed to be the word of

32
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
God, bearing down against the church;

33
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
declaring unto the people that

34
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
every priest and teacher ought to

35
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
become popular; and they ought not

36
00:23:44,0 --> 00:23:44,0
to labor with their hands, but that

37
00:23:44,0 --> 00:30:52,
they ought to be supported by the people.

38
00:30:52,0 --> 00:30:52,0
4 And he also testified unto the

39
00:30:52,0 --> 00:30:52,0
people that all mankind should be

40
00:30:52,0 --> 00:30:52,0
saved at the last day, and that

41
00:30:52,0 --> 00:30:52,0
they need not fear nor tremble,

42
00:30:52,0 --> 00:30:52,0
but that they might lift up their

43
00:30:52,0 --> 00:30:52,0
heads and rejoice; for the Lord

44
00:30:52,0 --> 00:30:52,0
had created all men, and had also

45
00:30:52,0 --> 00:30:52,0
redeemed all men; and, in the

46
00:30:52,0 --> 00:30:24,
end, all men should have eternal life.

47
00:30:24,0 --> 00:30:24,0
5 And it came to pass that he

48
00:30:24,0 --> 00:30:24,0
did teach these things so much

49
00:30:24,0 --> 00:30:24,0
that many did believe on his words,

50
00:30:24,0 --> 00:30:24,0
even so many that they began to

51
00:30:24,0 --> 00:29:56,
support him and give him money.

52
00:29:56,0 --> 00:29:56,0
6 And he began to be lifted

53
00:29:56,0 --> 00:29:56,0
up in the pride of his

54
00:29:56,0 --> 00:29:56,0
heart, and to wear very costly

55
00:29:56,0 --> 00:29:56,0
apparel, yea, and even

56
00:29:56,0 --> 00:29:56,0
began to establish a church

57
00:29:56,0 --> 00:29:28,
after the manner of his preaching.

58
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
7 And it came to pass as

59
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
he was going, to preach to

60
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
those who believed on his

61
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
word, he met a man who

62
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
belonged to the church of

63
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
God, yea, even one of their

64
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
teachers; and he began to

65
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
contend with him sharply,

66
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
that he might lead away the

67
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
people of the church; but

68
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
the man withstood him,

69
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:42,
admonishing him with the words of God.

70
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
8 Now the name of the

71
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
man was Gideon; and it

72
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
was he who was an

73
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
instrument in the hands of

74
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
God in delivering the

75
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:14,
people of Limhi out of bondage.

76
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
9 Now, because Gideon

77
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
withstood him with

78
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
the words of God he

79
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
was wroth with Gideon,

80
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
and drew his sword

81
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
and began to smite him.

82
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
Now Gideon being

83
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
stricken with many

84
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
years, therefore he was

85
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
not able to withstand

86
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
his blows, therefore

87
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:28,
he was slain by the sword.

88
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
10 And the man who

89
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
slew him was taken

90
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
by the people of

91
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
the church, and was

92
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
brought before Alma,

93
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
to be judged

94
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
according to the crimes

95
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:42,
which he had committed.

96
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
11 And it came to

97
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
pass that he

98
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
stood before Alma

99
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
and pled for

100
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:14,
himself with much boldness.

101
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
12 But Alma said

102
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
unto him:

103
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
Behold, this is the

104
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
first time that

105
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
priestcraft has

106
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
been introduced

107
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
among this

108
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
people. And behold,

109
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
thou art not only

110
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
guilty of

111
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
priestcraft, but hast

112
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
endeavored to

113
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
enforce it by the

114
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
sword; and were

115
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
priestcraft to

116
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
be enforced among

117
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
this people it

118
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
would prove

119
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:28,
their entire destruction.

120
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
13 And thou

121
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
hast shed the

122
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
blood of a

123
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
righteous man, yea, a

124
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
man who has done

125
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
much good

126
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
among this people;

127
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
and were we to

128
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
spare thee his

129
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
blood would

130
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:42,
come upon us for vengeance.

131
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
14 Therefore

132
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
thou art

133
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
condemned to die,

134
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
according to the

135
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
law which has

136
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
been given us

137
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
by Mosiah,

138
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
our last king;

139
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
and it has been

140
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
acknowledged

141
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
by this

142
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
people; therefore

143
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
this people must

144
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:14,
abide by the law.

145
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
15 And it

146
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
came to pass

147
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
that they took

148
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
him; and his

149
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
name was

150
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
Nehor; and they

151
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
carried him

152
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
upon the top of

153
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
the hill

154
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
Manti, and there

155
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
he was

156
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
caused, or rather

157
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
did

158
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
acknowledge, between

159
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
the heavens and

160
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
the earth,

161
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
that what he

162
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
had taught to

163
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
the people

164
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
was contrary to

165
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
the word of

166
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
God; and

167
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:28,
there he suffered an ignominious death.

168
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
16

169
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
Nevertheless, this

170
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
did not put an

171
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
end to the

172
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
spreading of

173
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
priestcraft

174
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
through the

175
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
land; for

176
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
there were

177
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
many who loved

178
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
the vain

179
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
things of the

180
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
world, and

181
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
they went

182
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
forth preaching

183
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
false

184
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
doctrines; and

185
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
this they did

186
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
for the sake

187
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:42,
of riches and honor.

188
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
17

189
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
Nevertheless, they

190
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
durst not

191
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
lie, if it

192
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
were known,

193
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
for fear of

194
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
the law,

195
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
for liars

196
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
were

197
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
punished; therefore

198
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
they

199
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
pretended to

200
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
preach

201
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
according to their

202
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
belief;

203
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
and now the

204
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
law could

205
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
have no power

206
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:14,
on any man for his belief.

207
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
18 And

208
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
they durst

209
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
not steal,

210
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
for fear of

211
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
the law,

212
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
for such

213
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
were

214
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
punished;

215
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
neither durst

216
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
they rob,

217
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
nor murder,

218
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
for he

219
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
that murdered

220
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
was

221
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:28,
punished unto death.

222
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
19 But it

223
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
came to

224
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
pass that

225
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
whosoever

226
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
did not

227
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
belong to the

228
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
church of

229
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
God began

230
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
to

231
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
persecute those

232
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
that did

233
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
belong to

234
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
the church

235
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
of God, and

236
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
had taken

237
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
upon them

238
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
the name

239
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:42,
of Christ.

240
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
20 Yea,

241
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
they did

242
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
persecute

243
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
them, and

244
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
afflict

245
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
them with

246
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
all

247
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
manner of

248
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
words, and

249
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
this

250
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
because of

251
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
their

252
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
humility;

253
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
because they

254
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
were not

255
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
proud in

256
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
their own

257
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
eyes, and

258
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
because

259
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
they did

260
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
impart

261
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
the word of

262
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
God, one

263
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
with

264
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
another,

265
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:14,
without money and without price.

266
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
21 Now

267
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
there was

268
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
a

269
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
strict law

270
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
among the

271
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
people

272
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
of the

273
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
church,

274
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
that there

275
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
should

276
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
not any

277
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
man,

278
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
belonging

279
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
to the

280
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
church,

281
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
arise and

282
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0


283
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
persecute those

284
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
that did

285
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
not

286
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
belong to

287
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
the

288
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
church, and

289
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
that

290
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
there should

291
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
be no

292
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:28,
persecution among themselves.

293
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
22

294
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0


295
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
Nevertheless,

296
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
there were

297
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
many

298
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
among

299
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
them who

300
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
began to

301
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
be

302
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
proud, and

303
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
began

304
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
to

305
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
contend

306
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
warmly

307
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
with their

308
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0


309
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
adversaries,

310
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
even

311
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
unto

312
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
blows; yea,

313
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
they

314
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
would

315
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
smite one

316
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:42,
another with their fists.

317
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
23 Now

318
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
this

319
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
was in

320
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
the

321
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
second

322
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
year

323
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
of the

324
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
reign

325
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
of

326
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
Alma, and

327
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
it

328
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
was a

329
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
cause of

330
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
much

331
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0


332
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
affliction

333
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
to the

334
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0


335
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
church; yea,

336
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
it

337
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
was the

338
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
cause

339
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
of

340
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:14,
much trial with the church.

341
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
24

342
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
For the

343
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0


344
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
hearts of

345
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
many

346
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
were

347
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0


348
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
hardened,

349
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
and

350
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
their

351
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0


352
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
names

353
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
were

354
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
blotted

355
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
out,

356
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
that

357
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
they

358
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
were

359
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0


360
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
remembered

361
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
no

362
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
more

363
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
among

364
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
the

365
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
people

366
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
of

367
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
God.

368
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
And

369
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
also

370
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:14,0
many

371
00:29:14,0 --> 00:29:28,
withdrew themselves from among them.

372
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
25

373
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
Now

374
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
this

375
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
was

376
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
a

377
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
great

378
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0


379
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
trial to

380
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0


381
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
those

382
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
that

383
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
did

384
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0


385
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
stand

386
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
fast

387
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
in

388
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
the

389
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
faith;

390
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0


391
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0


392
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0


393
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
nevertheless,

394
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
they

395
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
were

396
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0


397
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0


398
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
steadfast

399
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
and

400
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0


401
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
immovable

402
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
in

404
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
keeping

and

412
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0


413
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
they

414
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
bore

415
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0
with

416
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:28,0


417
00:29:28,0 --> 00:29:42,
patience the persecution which was heaped upon them.

418
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
26

419
00:29:42,0 --> 00:29:42,0
And
