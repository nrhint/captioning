00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:04,429
The Book of Alma the Son of AlmaThe account of

2
00:00:04,429 --> 00:00:08,858
Alma, who was the son of Alma, the first and

3
00:00:08,858 --> 00:00:13,287
chief judge over the people of Nephi, and also the

4
00:00:13,287 --> 00:00:17,716
high priest over the Church. An account of the

5
00:00:17,716 --> 00:00:22,145
reign of the judges, and the wars and contentions

6
00:00:22,145 --> 00:00:26,574
among the people. And also an account of a war

7
00:00:26,574 --> 00:00:31,003
between the Nephites and the Lamanites, according

8
00:00:31,003 --> 00:00:35,432
to the record of Alma, the first and chief

9
00:00:35,432 --> 00:00:39,861
judge.Chapter 1 Nehor teaches false doctrines,

10
00:00:39,861 --> 00:00:44,29
establishes a church, introduces priestcraft, and

11
00:00:44,29 --> 00:00:48,719
slays Gideon—Nehor is executed for his

12
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,148
crimes—Priestcrafts and persecutions spread among the

13
00:00:53,148 --> 00:00:57,577
people—The priests support themselves, the people care

14
00:00:57,577 --> 00:01:02,863
for the poor, and the Church prospers. About 91–88 B.C. 

15
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:09,641
1 Now it came to pass that in the first year

16
00:01:09,641 --> 00:01:16,419
of the reign of the judges over the people of

17
00:01:16,419 --> 00:01:23,197
Nephi, from this time forward, king Mosiah

18
00:01:23,197 --> 00:01:29,975
having gone the way of all the earth, having

19
00:01:29,975 --> 00:01:36,753
warred a good warfare, walking uprightly before

20
00:01:36,753 --> 00:01:43,531
God, leaving none to reign in his stead;

21
00:01:43,531 --> 00:01:50,309
nevertheless he had established laws, and they were

22
00:01:50,309 --> 00:01:57,087
acknowledged by the people; therefore they were

23
00:01:57,087 --> 00:02:03,09
obliged to abide by the laws which he had made.

24
00:02:03,09 --> 00:02:14,09
2 And it came to pass that in the

25
00:02:14,09 --> 00:02:25,09
first year of the reign of Alma in the

26
00:02:25,09 --> 00:02:36,09
judgment-seat, there was a man brought

27
00:02:36,09 --> 00:02:47,09
before him to be judged, a man who was

28
00:02:47,09 --> 00:02:58,912
large, and was noted for his much strength.

29
00:02:58,912 --> 00:02:59,579
3 And he had gone about among the

30
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:00,246
people, preaching to them that

31
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:00,913
which he termed to be the word of

32
00:03:00,913 --> 00:03:01,58
God, bearing down against the church;

33
00:03:01,58 --> 00:03:02,247
declaring unto the people that

34
00:03:02,247 --> 00:03:02,914
every priest and teacher ought to

35
00:03:02,914 --> 00:03:03,581
become popular; and they ought not

36
00:03:03,581 --> 00:03:04,248
to labor with their hands, but that

37
00:03:04,248 --> 00:03:04,785
they ought to be supported by the people.

38
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:06,896
4 And he also testified unto the

39
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:09,007
people that all mankind should be

40
00:03:09,007 --> 00:03:11,118
saved at the last day, and that

41
00:03:11,118 --> 00:03:13,229
they need not fear nor tremble,

42
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:15,34
but that they might lift up their

43
00:03:15,34 --> 00:03:17,451
heads and rejoice; for the Lord

44
00:03:17,451 --> 00:03:19,562
had created all men, and had also

45
00:03:19,562 --> 00:03:21,673
redeemed all men; and, in the

46
00:03:21,673 --> 00:03:23,103
end, all men should have eternal life.

47
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:26,503
5 And it came to pass that he

48
00:03:26,503 --> 00:03:29,903
did teach these things so much

49
00:03:29,903 --> 00:03:33,303
that many did believe on his words,

50
00:03:33,303 --> 00:03:36,703
even so many that they began to

51
00:03:36,703 --> 00:03:40,487
support him and give him money.

52
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:40,987
6 And he began to be lifted

53
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:41,487
up in the pride of his

54
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:41,987
heart, and to wear very costly

55
00:03:41,987 --> 00:03:42,487
apparel, yea, and even

56
00:03:42,487 --> 00:03:42,987
began to establish a church

57
00:03:42,987 --> 00:03:43,957
after the manner of his preaching.

58
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:45,207
7 And it came to pass as

59
00:03:45,207 --> 00:03:46,457
he was going, to preach to

60
00:03:46,457 --> 00:03:47,707
those who believed on his

61
00:03:47,707 --> 00:03:48,957
word, he met a man who

62
00:03:48,957 --> 00:03:50,207
belonged to the church of

63
00:03:50,207 --> 00:03:51,457
God, yea, even one of their

64
00:03:51,457 --> 00:03:52,707
teachers; and he began to

65
00:03:52,707 --> 00:03:53,957
contend with him sharply,

66
00:03:53,957 --> 00:03:55,207
that he might lead away the

67
00:03:55,207 --> 00:03:56,457
people of the church; but

68
00:03:56,457 --> 00:03:57,707
the man withstood him,

69
00:03:57,707 --> 00:03:58,238
admonishing him with the words of God.

70
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:58,071
8 Now the name of the

71
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:57,904
man was Gideon; and it

72
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:57,737
was he who was an

73
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:57,57
instrument in the hands of

74
00:03:57,57 --> 00:03:57,403
God in delivering the

75
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:57,771
people of Limhi out of bondage.

76
00:03:57,771 --> 00:03:58,688
9 Now, because Gideon

77
00:03:58,688 --> 00:03:59,605
withstood him with

78
00:03:59,605 --> 00:04:00,522
the words of God he

79
00:04:00,522 --> 00:04:01,439
was wroth with Gideon,

80
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,356
and drew his sword

81
00:04:02,356 --> 00:04:03,273
and began to smite him.

82
00:04:03,273 --> 00:04:04,19
Now Gideon being

83
00:04:04,19 --> 00:04:05,107
stricken with many

84
00:04:05,107 --> 00:04:06,024
years, therefore he was

85
00:04:06,024 --> 00:04:06,941
not able to withstand

86
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:07,858
his blows, therefore

87
00:04:07,858 --> 00:04:08,749
he was slain by the sword.

88
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:13,249
10 And the man who

89
00:04:13,249 --> 00:04:17,749
slew him was taken

90
00:04:17,749 --> 00:04:22,249
by the people of

91
00:04:22,249 --> 00:04:26,749
the church, and was

92
00:04:26,749 --> 00:04:31,249
brought before Alma,

93
00:04:31,249 --> 00:04:35,749
to be judged

94
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:40,249
according to the crimes

95
00:04:40,249 --> 00:04:44,084
which he had committed.

96
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:45,684
11 And it came to

97
00:04:45,684 --> 00:04:47,284
pass that he

98
00:04:47,284 --> 00:04:48,884
stood before Alma

99
00:04:48,884 --> 00:04:50,484
and pled for

100
00:04:50,484 --> 00:04:52,058
himself with much boldness.

101
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:53,426
12 But Alma said

102
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:54,794
unto him:

103
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,162
Behold, this is the

104
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:57,53
first time that

105
00:04:57,53 --> 00:04:58,898
priestcraft has

106
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:00,266
been introduced

107
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:01,634
among this

108
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,002
people. And behold,

109
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:04,37
thou art not only

110
00:05:04,37 --> 00:05:05,738
guilty of

111
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:07,106
priestcraft, but hast

112
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:08,474
endeavored to

113
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,842
enforce it by the

114
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:11,21
sword; and were

115
00:05:11,21 --> 00:05:12,578
priestcraft to

116
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:13,946
be enforced among

117
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:15,314
this people it

118
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:16,682
would prove

119
00:05:16,682 --> 00:05:18,385
their entire destruction.

120
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:20,203
13 And thou

121
00:05:20,203 --> 00:05:22,021
hast shed the

122
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:23,839
blood of a

123
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,657
righteous man, yea, a

124
00:05:25,657 --> 00:05:27,475
man who has done

125
00:05:27,475 --> 00:05:29,293
much good

126
00:05:29,293 --> 00:05:31,111
among this people;

127
00:05:31,111 --> 00:05:32,929
and were we to

128
00:05:32,929 --> 00:05:34,747
spare thee his

129
00:05:34,747 --> 00:05:36,565
blood would

130
00:05:36,565 --> 00:05:38,738
come upon us for vengeance.

131
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:41,809
14 Therefore

132
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:44,88
thou art

133
00:05:44,88 --> 00:05:47,951
condemned to die,

134
00:05:47,951 --> 00:05:51,022
according to the

135
00:05:51,022 --> 00:05:54,093
law which has

136
00:05:54,093 --> 00:05:57,164
been given us

137
00:05:57,164 --> 00:06:00,235
by Mosiah,

138
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:03,306
our last king;

139
00:06:03,306 --> 00:06:06,377
and it has been

140
00:06:06,377 --> 00:06:09,448
acknowledged

141
00:06:09,448 --> 00:06:12,519
by this

142
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:15,59
people; therefore

143
00:06:15,59 --> 00:06:18,661
this people must

144
00:06:18,661 --> 00:06:21,014
abide by the law.

145
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:20,971
15 And it

146
00:06:20,971 --> 00:06:20,928
came to pass

147
00:06:20,928 --> 00:06:20,885
that they took

148
00:06:20,885 --> 00:06:20,842
him; and his

149
00:06:20,842 --> 00:06:20,799
name was

150
00:06:20,799 --> 00:06:20,756
Nehor; and they

151
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:20,713
carried him

152
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:20,67
upon the top of

153
00:06:20,67 --> 00:06:20,627
the hill

154
00:06:20,627 --> 00:06:20,584
Manti, and there

155
00:06:20,584 --> 00:06:20,541
he was

156
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:20,498
caused, or rather

157
00:06:20,498 --> 00:06:20,455
did

158
00:06:20,455 --> 00:06:20,412
acknowledge, between

159
00:06:20,412 --> 00:06:20,369
the heavens and

160
00:06:20,369 --> 00:06:20,326
the earth,

161
00:06:20,326 --> 00:06:20,283
that what he

162
00:06:20,283 --> 00:06:20,24
had taught to

163
00:06:20,24 --> 00:06:20,197
the people

164
00:06:20,197 --> 00:06:20,154
was contrary to

165
00:06:20,154 --> 00:06:20,111
the word of

166
00:06:20,111 --> 00:06:20,068
God; and

167
00:06:20,068 --> 00:06:20,08
there he suffered an ignominious death.

168
00:06:20,08 --> 00:06:21,43
16

169
00:06:21,43 --> 00:06:22,78
Nevertheless, this

170
00:06:22,78 --> 00:06:24,13
did not put an

171
00:06:24,13 --> 00:06:25,48
end to the

172
00:06:25,48 --> 00:06:26,83
spreading of

173
00:06:26,83 --> 00:06:28,18
priestcraft

174
00:06:28,18 --> 00:06:29,53
through the

175
00:06:29,53 --> 00:06:30,88
land; for

176
00:06:30,88 --> 00:06:32,23
there were

177
00:06:32,23 --> 00:06:33,58
many who loved

178
00:06:33,58 --> 00:06:34,93
the vain

179
00:06:34,93 --> 00:06:36,28
things of the

180
00:06:36,28 --> 00:06:37,63
world, and

181
00:06:37,63 --> 00:06:38,98
they went

182
00:06:38,98 --> 00:06:40,33
forth preaching

183
00:06:40,33 --> 00:06:41,68
false

184
00:06:41,68 --> 00:06:43,03
doctrines; and

185
00:06:43,03 --> 00:06:44,38
this they did

186
00:06:44,38 --> 00:06:45,73
for the sake

187
00:06:45,73 --> 00:06:47,007
of riches and honor.

188
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:49,007
17

189
00:06:49,007 --> 00:06:51,007
Nevertheless, they

190
00:06:51,007 --> 00:06:53,007
durst not

191
00:06:53,007 --> 00:06:55,007
lie, if it

192
00:06:55,007 --> 00:06:57,007
were known,

193
00:06:57,007 --> 00:06:59,007
for fear of

194
00:06:59,007 --> 00:07:01,007
the law,

195
00:07:01,007 --> 00:07:03,007
for liars

196
00:07:03,007 --> 00:07:05,007
were

197
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:07,007
punished; therefore

198
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,007
they

199
00:07:09,007 --> 00:07:11,007
pretended to

200
00:07:11,007 --> 00:07:13,007
preach

201
00:07:13,007 --> 00:07:15,007
according to their

202
00:07:15,007 --> 00:07:17,007
belief;

203
00:07:17,007 --> 00:07:19,007
and now the

204
00:07:19,007 --> 00:07:21,007
law could

205
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:23,007
have no power

206
00:07:23,007 --> 00:07:25,945
on any man for his belief.

207
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:26,612
18 And

208
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:27,279
they durst

209
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:27,946
not steal,

210
00:07:27,946 --> 00:07:28,613
for fear of

211
00:07:28,613 --> 00:07:29,28
the law,

212
00:07:29,28 --> 00:07:29,947
for such

213
00:07:29,947 --> 00:07:30,614
were

214
00:07:30,614 --> 00:07:31,281
punished;

215
00:07:31,281 --> 00:07:31,948
neither durst

216
00:07:31,948 --> 00:07:32,615
they rob,

217
00:07:32,615 --> 00:07:33,282
nor murder,

218
00:07:33,282 --> 00:07:33,95
for he

219
00:07:33,95 --> 00:07:34,616
that murdered

220
00:07:34,616 --> 00:07:35,284
was

221
00:07:35,284 --> 00:07:35,355
punished unto death.

222
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:35,911
19 But it

223
00:07:35,911 --> 00:07:36,467
came to

224
00:07:36,467 --> 00:07:37,023
pass that

225
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:37,579
whosoever

226
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:38,135
did not

227
00:07:38,135 --> 00:07:38,691
belong to the

228
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:39,247
church of

229
00:07:39,247 --> 00:07:39,803
God began

230
00:07:39,803 --> 00:07:40,359
to

231
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:40,915
persecute those

232
00:07:40,915 --> 00:07:41,471
that did

233
00:07:41,471 --> 00:07:42,027
belong to

234
00:07:42,027 --> 00:07:42,583
the church

235
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:43,139
of God, and

236
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:43,695
had taken

237
00:07:43,695 --> 00:07:44,251
upon them

238
00:07:44,251 --> 00:07:44,807
the name

239
00:07:44,807 --> 00:07:45,265
of Christ.

240
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:45,688
20 Yea,

241
00:07:45,688 --> 00:07:46,111
they did

242
00:07:46,111 --> 00:07:46,534
persecute

243
00:07:46,534 --> 00:07:46,957
them, and

244
00:07:46,957 --> 00:07:47,38
afflict

245
00:07:47,38 --> 00:07:47,803
them with

246
00:07:47,803 --> 00:07:48,226
all

247
00:07:48,226 --> 00:07:48,649
manner of

248
00:07:48,649 --> 00:07:49,072
words, and

249
00:07:49,072 --> 00:07:49,495
this

250
00:07:49,495 --> 00:07:49,918
because of

251
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:50,341
their

252
00:07:50,341 --> 00:07:50,764
humility;

253
00:07:50,764 --> 00:07:51,187
because they

254
00:07:51,187 --> 00:07:51,61
were not

255
00:07:51,61 --> 00:07:52,033
proud in

256
00:07:52,033 --> 00:07:52,456
their own

257
00:07:52,456 --> 00:07:52,879
eyes, and

258
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:53,302
because

259
00:07:53,302 --> 00:07:53,725
they did

260
00:07:53,725 --> 00:07:54,148
impart

261
00:07:54,148 --> 00:07:54,571
the word of

262
00:07:54,571 --> 00:07:54,994
God, one

263
00:07:54,994 --> 00:07:55,417
with

264
00:07:55,417 --> 00:07:55,84
another,

265
00:07:55,84 --> 00:07:56,71
without money and without price.

266
00:07:56,71 --> 00:07:57,266
21 Now

267
00:07:57,266 --> 00:07:57,822
there was

268
00:07:57,822 --> 00:07:58,378
a

269
00:07:58,378 --> 00:07:58,934
strict law

270
00:07:58,934 --> 00:07:59,49
among the

271
00:07:59,49 --> 00:08:00,046
people

272
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:00,602
of the

273
00:08:00,602 --> 00:08:01,158
church,

274
00:08:01,158 --> 00:08:01,714
that there

275
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:02,27
should

276
00:08:02,27 --> 00:08:02,826
not any

277
00:08:02,826 --> 00:08:03,382
man,

278
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:03,938
belonging

279
00:08:03,938 --> 00:08:04,494
to the

280
00:08:04,494 --> 00:08:05,05
church,

281
00:08:05,05 --> 00:08:05,606
arise and

282
00:08:05,606 --> 00:08:06,162


283
00:08:06,162 --> 00:08:06,718
persecute those

284
00:08:06,718 --> 00:08:07,274
that did

285
00:08:07,274 --> 00:08:07,83
not

286
00:08:07,83 --> 00:08:08,386
belong to

287
00:08:08,386 --> 00:08:08,942
the

288
00:08:08,942 --> 00:08:09,498
church, and

289
00:08:09,498 --> 00:08:10,054
that

290
00:08:10,054 --> 00:08:10,61
there should

291
00:08:10,61 --> 00:08:11,166
be no

292
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:11,691
persecution among themselves.

293
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:12,274
22

294
00:08:12,274 --> 00:08:12,857


295
00:08:12,857 --> 00:08:13,44
Nevertheless,

296
00:08:13,44 --> 00:08:14,023
there were

297
00:08:14,023 --> 00:08:14,606
many

298
00:08:14,606 --> 00:08:15,189
among

299
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:15,772
them who

300
00:08:15,772 --> 00:08:16,355
began to

301
00:08:16,355 --> 00:08:16,938
be

302
00:08:16,938 --> 00:08:17,521
proud, and

303
00:08:17,521 --> 00:08:18,104
began

304
00:08:18,104 --> 00:08:18,687
to

305
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,27
contend

306
00:08:19,27 --> 00:08:19,853
warmly

307
00:08:19,853 --> 00:08:20,436
with their

308
00:08:20,436 --> 00:08:21,019


309
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:21,602
adversaries,

310
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:22,185
even

311
00:08:22,185 --> 00:08:22,768
unto

312
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:23,351
blows; yea,

313
00:08:23,351 --> 00:08:23,934
they

314
00:08:23,934 --> 00:08:24,517
would

315
00:08:24,517 --> 00:08:25,1
smite one

316
00:08:25,1 --> 00:08:25,505
another with their fists.

317
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,005
23 Now

318
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:26,505
this

319
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:27,005
was in

320
00:08:27,005 --> 00:08:27,505
the

321
00:08:27,505 --> 00:08:28,005
second

322
00:08:28,005 --> 00:08:28,505
year

323
00:08:28,505 --> 00:08:29,005
of the

324
00:08:29,005 --> 00:08:29,505
reign

325
00:08:29,505 --> 00:08:30,005
of

326
00:08:30,005 --> 00:08:30,505
Alma, and

327
00:08:30,505 --> 00:08:31,005
it

328
00:08:31,005 --> 00:08:31,505
was a

329
00:08:31,505 --> 00:08:32,005
cause of

330
00:08:32,005 --> 00:08:32,505
much

331
00:08:32,505 --> 00:08:33,005


332
00:08:33,005 --> 00:08:33,505
affliction

333
00:08:33,505 --> 00:08:34,005
to the

334
00:08:34,005 --> 00:08:34,505


335
00:08:34,505 --> 00:08:35,005
church; yea,

336
00:08:35,005 --> 00:08:35,505
it

337
00:08:35,505 --> 00:08:36,005
was the

338
00:08:36,005 --> 00:08:36,505
cause

339
00:08:36,505 --> 00:08:37,005
of

340
00:08:37,005 --> 00:08:37,884
much trial with the church.

341
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:38,755
24

342
00:08:38,755 --> 00:08:39,626
For the

343
00:08:39,626 --> 00:08:40,497


344
00:08:40,497 --> 00:08:41,368
hearts of

345
00:08:41,368 --> 00:08:42,239
many

346
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,11
were

347
00:08:43,11 --> 00:08:43,981


348
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:44,852
hardened,

349
00:08:44,852 --> 00:08:45,723
and

350
00:08:45,723 --> 00:08:46,594
their

351
00:08:46,594 --> 00:08:47,465


352
00:08:47,465 --> 00:08:48,336
names

353
00:08:48,336 --> 00:08:49,207
were

354
00:08:49,207 --> 00:08:50,078
blotted

355
00:08:50,078 --> 00:08:50,949
out,

356
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:51,82
that

357
00:08:51,82 --> 00:08:52,691
they

358
00:08:52,691 --> 00:08:53,562
were

359
00:08:53,562 --> 00:08:54,433


360
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:55,304
remembered

361
00:08:55,304 --> 00:08:56,175
no

362
00:08:56,175 --> 00:08:57,046
more

363
00:08:57,046 --> 00:08:57,917
among

364
00:08:57,917 --> 00:08:58,788
the

365
00:08:58,788 --> 00:08:59,659
people

366
00:08:59,659 --> 00:09:00,53
of

367
00:09:00,53 --> 00:09:01,401
God.

368
00:09:01,401 --> 00:09:02,272
And

369
00:09:02,272 --> 00:09:03,143
also

370
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:04,014
many

371
00:09:04,014 --> 00:09:04,21
withdrew themselves from among them.

372
00:09:04,21 --> 00:09:04,471
25

373
00:09:04,471 --> 00:09:04,732
Now

374
00:09:04,732 --> 00:09:04,993
this

375
00:09:04,993 --> 00:09:05,254
was

376
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:05,515
a

377
00:09:05,515 --> 00:09:05,776
great

378
00:09:05,776 --> 00:09:06,037


379
00:09:06,037 --> 00:09:06,298
trial to

380
00:09:06,298 --> 00:09:06,559


381
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:06,82
those

382
00:09:06,82 --> 00:09:07,081
that

383
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:07,342
did

384
00:09:07,342 --> 00:09:07,603


385
00:09:07,603 --> 00:09:07,864
stand

386
00:09:07,864 --> 00:09:08,125
fast

387
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:08,386
in

388
00:09:08,386 --> 00:09:08,647
the

389
00:09:08,647 --> 00:09:08,908
faith;

390
00:09:08,908 --> 00:09:09,169


391
00:09:09,169 --> 00:09:09,43


392
00:09:09,43 --> 00:09:09,691


393
00:09:09,691 --> 00:09:09,952
nevertheless,

394
00:09:09,952 --> 00:09:10,213
they

395
00:09:10,213 --> 00:09:10,474
were

396
00:09:10,474 --> 00:09:10,735


397
00:09:10,735 --> 00:09:10,996


398
00:09:10,996 --> 00:09:11,257
steadfast

399
00:09:11,257 --> 00:09:11,518
and

400
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:11,779


401
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:12,04
immovable

402
00:09:12,04 --> 00:09:12,301
in

403
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:12,562


404
00:09:12,562 --> 00:09:12,823
keeping

405
00:09:12,823 --> 00:09:13,084
the

406
00:09:13,084 --> 00:09:13,345


407
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:13,606


408
00:09:13,606 --> 00:09:13,867
commandments

409
00:09:13,867 --> 00:09:14,128
of

410
00:09:14,128 --> 00:09:14,389
