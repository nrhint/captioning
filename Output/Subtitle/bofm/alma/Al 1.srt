The Book of Alma the Son of AlmaThe account of

2
00:00:13,071 --> 00:00:26,142
 Alma, who was the son of Alma, the first and chief

3
00:00:26,142 --> 00:00:39,213
 judge over the people of Nephi, and also the high

4
00:00:39,213 --> 00:00:52,284
 priest over the Church. An account of the reign of

5
00:00:52,284 --> 00:01:05,355
 the judges, and the wars and contentions among the

6
00:01:05,355 --> 00:01:18,426
 people. And also an account of a war between the

7
00:01:18,426 --> 00:01:31,497
 Nephites and the Lamanites, according to the record

8
00:01:31,497 --> 00:01:44,568
 of Alma, the first and chief judge.Chapter 1

00:01:44,568 --> 00:01:57,639
 Nehor teaches false doctrines, establishes a church,

10
00:01:57,639 --> 00:02:10,71
 introduces priestcraft, and slays Gideon—Nehor is

11
00:02:10,71 --> 00:02:23,781
 executed for his crimes—Priestcrafts and

12
00:02:23,781 --> 00:02:36,852
 persecutions spread among the people—The priests support

13
00:02:36,852 --> 00:02:49,923
 themselves, the people care for the poor, and the

14
00:02:49,923 --> 00:03:02,994
 Church prospers. About 91–88 B.C.

15
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:03,528
1 Now it came to pass that in the first year of

16
00:03:03,528 --> 00:03:03,639
 the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi,

17
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:03,75
 from this time forward, king Mosiah having gone the

18
00:03:03,75 --> 00:03:03,861
 way of all the earth, having warred a good

19
00:03:03,861 --> 00:03:03,972
 warfare, walking uprightly before God, leaving none to

20
00:03:03,972 --> 00:03:04,083
 reign in his stead; nevertheless he had established

21
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:04,194
 laws, and they were acknowledged by the people;

22
00:03:04,194 --> 00:03:04,305
 therefore they were obliged to abide by the laws

23
00:03:04,305 --> 00:03:04,416
 which he had made

24
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:08,901
2 And it came to pass that in the first year of

25
00:03:08,901 --> 00:03:13,651
 the reign of Alma in the judgment-seat, there was a

26
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:18,401
 man brought before him to be judged, a man who was

27
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:23,151
 large, and was noted for his much strength

28
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:29,904
3 And he had gone about among the people,

29
00:03:29,904 --> 00:03:35,904
 preaching to them that which he termed to be the word of

30
00:03:35,904 --> 00:03:41,904
 God, bearing down against the church; declaring

31
00:03:41,904 --> 00:03:47,904
 unto the people that every priest and teacher ought

32
00:03:47,904 --> 00:03:53,904
 to become popular; and they ought not to labor with

33
00:03:53,904 --> 00:03:59,904
 their hands, but that they ought to be supported

34
00:03:59,904 --> 00:04:05,904
 by the people

35
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:13,412
4 And he also testified unto the people that all

36
00:04:13,412 --> 00:04:21,245
 mankind should be saved at the last day, and that

37
00:04:21,245 --> 00:04:29,078
 they need not fear nor tremble, but that they might

38
00:04:29,078 --> 00:04:36,911
 lift up their heads and rejoice; for the Lord had

39
00:04:36,911 --> 00:04:44,744
 created all men, and had also redeemed all men;

40
00:04:44,744 --> 00:04:52,577
 and, in the end, all men should have eternal life

41
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:59,476
5 And it came to pass that he did teach these

42
00:04:59,476 --> 00:05:06,226
 things so much that many did believe on his words,

43
00:05:06,226 --> 00:05:12,976
 even so many that they began to support him and give

44
00:05:12,976 --> 00:05:19,726
 him money

45
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:24,836
6 And he began to be lifted up in the pride of his

46
00:05:24,836 --> 00:05:30,086
 heart, and to wear very costly apparel, yea, and

47
00:05:30,086 --> 00:05:35,336
 even began to establish a church after the manner

48
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:40,586
 of his preaching

49
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:46,516
7 And it came to pass as he was going, to preach

50
00:05:46,516 --> 00:05:52,659
 to those who believed on his word, he met a man who

51
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:58,802
 belonged to the church of God, yea, even one of

52
00:05:58,802 --> 00:06:04,945
 their teachers; and he began to contend with him

53
00:06:04,945 --> 00:06:11,088
 sharply, that he might lead away the people of the

54
00:06:11,088 --> 00:06:17,231
 church; but the man withstood him, admonishing him

55
00:06:17,231 --> 00:06:23,374
 with the words of God

56
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:30,049
8 Now the name of the man was Gideon; and it was

57
00:06:30,049 --> 00:06:37,049
 he who was an instrument in the hands of God in

58
00:06:37,049 --> 00:06:44,049
 delivering the people of Limhi out of bondage

59
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:51,771
9 Now, because Gideon withstood him with the words

60
00:06:51,771 --> 00:06:58,771
 of God he was wroth with Gideon, and drew his

61
00:06:58,771 --> 00:07:05,771
 sword and began to smite him. Now Gideon being

62
00:07:05,771 --> 00:07:12,771
 stricken with many years, therefore he was not able to

63
00:07:12,771 --> 00:07:19,771
 withstand his blows, therefore he was slain by the

64
00:07:19,771 --> 00:07:26,771
 sword

65
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:31,313
10 And the man who slew him was taken by the

66
00:07:31,313 --> 00:07:36,313
 people of the church, and was brought before Alma, to

67
00:07:36,313 --> 00:07:41,313
 be judged according to the crimes which he had

68
00:07:41,313 --> 00:07:46,313
 committed

69
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:56,132
11 And it came to pass that he stood before Alma

70
00:07:56,132 --> 00:08:06,132
 and pled for himself with much boldness

71
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:07,596
12 But Alma said unto him: Behold, this is the

72
00:08:07,596 --> 00:08:08,739
 first time that priestcraft has been introduced among

73
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:09,882
 this people. And behold, thou art not only guilty

74
00:08:09,882 --> 00:08:11,025
 of priestcraft, but hast endeavored to enforce it

75
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:12,168
 by the sword; and were priestcraft to be enforced

76
00:08:12,168 --> 00:08:13,311
 among this people it would prove their entire

77
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,454
 destruction

78
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:20,427
13 And thou hast shed the blood of a righteous

79
00:08:20,427 --> 00:08:26,427
 man, yea, a man who has done much good among this

80
00:08:26,427 --> 00:08:32,427
 people; and were we to spare thee his blood would

81
00:08:32,427 --> 00:08:38,427
 come upon us for vengeance

82
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,551
14 Therefore thou art condemned to die, according

83
00:08:41,551 --> 00:08:44,751
 to the law which has been given us by Mosiah, our

84
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:47,951
 last king; and it has been acknowledged by this

85
00:08:47,951 --> 00:08:51,151
 people; therefore this people must abide by the law

86
00:08:51,151 --> 00:08:54,351


87
00:08:54,3 --> 00:08:55,443
15 And it came to pass that they took him; and his

88
00:08:55,443 --> 00:08:56,586
 name was Nehor; and they carried him upon the top

89
00:08:56,586 --> 00:08:57,729
 of the hill Manti, and there he was caused, or

90
00:08:57,729 --> 00:08:58,872
 rather did acknowledge, between the heavens and the

91
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,015
 earth, that what he had taught to the people was

92
00:09:00,015 --> 00:09:01,158
 contrary to the word of God; and there he suffered

93
00:09:01,158 --> 00:09:02,301
 an ignominious death

94
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:03,875
16 Nevertheless, this did not put an end to the

95
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,475
 spreading of priestcraft through the land; for there

96
00:09:05,475 --> 00:09:07,075
 were many who loved the vain things of the world,

97
00:09:07,075 --> 00:09:08,675
 and they went forth preaching false doctrines;

98
00:09:08,675 --> 00:09:10,275
 and this they did for the sake of riches and honor

99
00:09:10,25 --> 00:09:13,45
17 Nevertheless, they durst not lie, if it were

100
00:09:13,45 --> 00:09:16,65
 known, for fear of the law, for liars were punished;

101
00:09:16,65 --> 00:09:19,85
 therefore they pretended to preach according to

102
00:09:19,85 --> 00:09:23,05
 their belief; and now the law could have no power

103
00:09:23,05 --> 00:09:26,25
 on any man for his belief

104
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:30,199
18 And they durst not steal, for fear of the law,

105
00:09:30,199 --> 00:09:34,199
 for such were punished; neither durst they rob,

106
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:38,199
 nor murder, for he that murdered was punished unto

107
00:09:38,199 --> 00:09:42,199
 death

108
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,148
19 But it came to pass that whosoever did not

109
00:09:44,148 --> 00:09:46,148
 belong to the church of God began to persecute those

110
00:09:46,148 --> 00:09:48,148
 that did belong to the church of God, and had taken

111
00:09:48,148 --> 00:09:50,148
 upon them the name of Christ

112
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:51,456
20 Yea, they did persecute them, and afflict them

113
00:09:51,456 --> 00:09:52,789
 with all manner of words, and this because of

114
00:09:52,789 --> 00:09:54,122
 their humility; because they were not proud in their

115
00:09:54,122 --> 00:09:55,455
 own eyes, and because they did impart the word of

116
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,788
 God, one with another, without money and without

117
00:09:56,788 --> 00:09:58,121
 price

118
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,698
21 Now there was a strict law among the people of

119
00:09:59,698 --> 00:10:01,298
 the church, that there should not any man,

120
00:10:01,298 --> 00:10:02,898
 belonging to the church, arise and persecute those that

121
00:10:02,898 --> 00:10:04,498
 did not belong to the church, and that there should

122
00:10:04,498 --> 00:10:06,098
 be no persecution among themselves

123
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,072
22 Nevertheless, there were many among them who

124
00:10:08,072 --> 00:10:10,072
 began to be proud, and began to contend warmly with

125
00:10:10,072 --> 00:10:12,072
 their adversaries, even unto blows; yea, they

126
00:10:12,072 --> 00:10:14,072
 would smite one another with their fists

127
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:16,047
23 Now this was in the second year of the reign of

128
00:10:16,047 --> 00:10:18,047
 Alma, and it was a cause of much affliction to

129
00:10:18,047 --> 00:10:20,047
 the church; yea, it was the cause of much trial with

130
00:10:20,047 --> 00:10:22,047
 the church

131
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:27,771
24 For the hearts of many were hardened, and their

132
00:10:27,771 --> 00:10:33,521
 names were blotted out, that they were remembered

133
00:10:33,521 --> 00:10:39,271
 no more among the people of God. And also many

134
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:45,021
 withdrew themselves from among them

135
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:47,545
25 Now this was a great trial to those that did

136
00:10:47,545 --> 00:10:49,145
 stand fast in the faith; nevertheless, they were

137
00:10:49,145 --> 00:10:50,745
 steadfast and immovable in keeping the commandments

138
00:10:50,745 --> 00:10:52,345
 of God, and they bore with patience the persecution

139
00:10:52,345 --> 00:10:53,945
 which was heaped upon them

140
00:10:53,92 --> 00:10:54,647
26 And when the priests left their labor to impart

141
00:10:54,647 --> 00:10:55,374
 the word of God unto the people, the people also

142
00:10:55,374 --> 00:10:56,101
 left their labors to hear the word of God. And

143
00:10:56,101 --> 00:10:56,828
 when the priest had imparted unto them the word of

144
00:10:56,828 --> 00:10:57,555
 God they all returned again diligently unto their

145
00:10:57,555 --> 00:10:58,282
 labors; and the priest, not esteeming himself above

146
00:10:58,282 --> 00:10:59,009
 his hearers, for the preacher was no better than

147
00:10:59,009 --> 00:10:59,736
 the hearer, neither was the teacher any better than

148
00:10:59,736 --> 00:11:00,463
 the learner; and thus they were all equal, and

149
00:11:00,463 --> 00:11:01,19
 they did all labor, every man according to his

150
00:11:01,19 --> 00:11:01,917
 strength

151
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:03,495
27 And they did impart of their substance, every

152
00:11:03,495 --> 00:11:05,095
 man according to that which he had, to the poor,

153
00:11:05,095 --> 00:11:06,695
 and the needy, and the sick, and the afflicted; and

154
00:11:06,695 --> 00:11:08,295
 they did not wear costly apparel, yet they were

155
00:11:08,295 --> 00:11:09,895
 neat and comely

156
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:12,536
28 And thus they did establish the affairs of the

157
00:11:12,536 --> 00:11:15,203
 church; and thus they began to have continual

158
00:11:15,203 --> 00:11:17,87
 peace again, notwithstanding all their persecutions

159
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:18,844
29 And now, because of the steadiness of the

160
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:19,844
 church they began to be exceedingly rich, having

161
00:11:19,844 --> 00:11:20,844
 abundance of all things whatsoever they stood in need—an

162
00:11:20,844 --> 00:11:21,844
 abundance of flocks and herds, and fatlings of

163
00:11:21,844 --> 00:11:22,844
 every kind, and also abundance of grain, and of

164
00:11:22,844 --> 00:11:23,844
 gold, and of silver, and of precious things, and

165
00:11:23,844 --> 00:11:24,844
 abundance of silk and fine-twined linen, and all manner

166
00:11:24,844 --> 00:11:25,844
 of good homely cloth

167
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:26,707
30 And thus, in their prosperous circumstances,

168
00:11:26,707 --> 00:11:27,596
 they did not send away any who were naked, or that

169
00:11:27,596 --> 00:11:28,485
 were hungry, or that were athirst, or that were

170
00:11:28,485 --> 00:11:29,374
 sick, or that had not been nourished; and they did

171
00:11:29,374 --> 00:11:30,263
 not set their hearts upon riches; therefore they

172
00:11:30,263 --> 00:11:31,152
 were liberal to all, both old and young, both bond

173
00:11:31,152 --> 00:11:32,041
 and free, both male and female, whether out of the

174
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:32,93
 church or in the church, having no respect to

175
00:11:32,93 --> 00:11:33,819
 persons as to those who stood in need

176
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:36,46
31 And thus they did prosper and become far more

177
00:11:36,46 --> 00:11:39,127
 wealthy than those who did not belong to their

178
00:11:39,127 --> 00:11:41,794
 church

179
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:42,657
32 For those who did not belong to their church

180
00:11:42,657 --> 00:11:43,546
 did indulge themselves in sorceries, and in idolatry

181
00:11:43,546 --> 00:11:44,435
 or idleness, and in babblings, and in envyings

182
00:11:44,435 --> 00:11:45,324
 and strife; wearing costly apparel; being lifted up

183
00:11:45,324 --> 00:11:46,213
 in the pride of their own eyes; persecuting,

184
00:11:46,213 --> 00:11:47,102
 lying, thieving, robbing, committing whoredoms, and

185
00:11:47,102 --> 00:11:47,991
 murdering, and all manner of wickedness;

186
00:11:47,991 --> 00:11:48,88
 nevertheless, the law was put in force upon all those who did

187
00:11:48,88 --> 00:11:49,769
 transgress it, inasmuch as it was possible

188
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:49,885
33 And it came to pass that by thus exercising the

189
00:11:49,885 --> 00:11:50,028
 law upon them, every man suffering according to

190
00:11:50,028 --> 00:11:50,171
 that which he had done, they became more still, and

191
00:11:50,171 --> 00:11:50,314
 durst not commit any wickedness if it were known;

192
00:11:50,314 --> 00:11:50,457
 therefore, there was much peace among the people

193
00:11:50,457 --> 00:11:50,6
 of Nephi until the fifth year of the reign of the

194
00:11:50,6 --> 00:11:50,743
 judges.
