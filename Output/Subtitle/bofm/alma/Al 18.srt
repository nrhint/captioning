00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:11,0
Chapter 18 King Lamoni supposes that Ammon is the

2
00:00:11,0 --> 00:00:22,0
 Great Spirit—Ammon teaches the king about the

3
00:00:22,0 --> 00:00:33,0
 Creation, God’s dealings with men, and the redemption

4
00:00:33,0 --> 00:00:44,0
 that comes through Christ—Lamoni believes and

5
00:00:44,0 --> 00:00:55,0
 falls to the earth as if dead. About 90 B.C.

6
00:00:55,122 --> 00:01:01,872
1 And it came to pass that king Lamoni caused that

7
00:01:01,872 --> 00:01:08,622
 his servants should stand forth and testify to

8
00:01:08,622 --> 00:01:15,372
 all the things which they had seen concerning the

9
00:01:15,372 --> 00:01:22,122
 matter

10
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:34,027
2 And when they had all testified to the things

11
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:45,138
 which they had seen, and he had learned of the

12
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:56,249
 faithfulness of Ammon in preserving his flocks, and

13
00:01:56,249 --> 00:02:07,36
 also of his great power in contending against those

14
00:02:07,36 --> 00:02:18,471
 who sought to slay him, he was astonished

15
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:29,582
 exceedingly, and said: Surely, this is more than a man.

16
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:40,693
 Behold, is not this the Great Spirit who doth send

17
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:51,804
 such great punishments upon this people, because of

18
00:02:51,804 --> 00:03:02,915
 their murders

19
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:04,938
3 And they answered the king, and said: Whether he

20
00:03:04,938 --> 00:03:07,16
 be the Great Spirit or a man, we know not; but

21
00:03:07,16 --> 00:03:09,382
 this much we do know, that he cannot be slain by the

22
00:03:09,382 --> 00:03:11,604
 enemies of the king; neither can they scatter the

23
00:03:11,604 --> 00:03:13,826
 king’s flocks when he is with us, because of his

24
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:16,048
 expertness and great strength; therefore, we know

25
00:03:16,048 --> 00:03:18,27
 that he is a friend to the king. And now, O king,

26
00:03:18,27 --> 00:03:20,492
 we do not believe that a man has such great power,

27
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,714
 for we know he cannot be slain

28
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:39,369
4 And now, when the king heard these words, he

29
00:03:39,369 --> 00:03:56,536
 said unto them: Now I know that it is the Great

30
00:03:56,536 --> 00:04:13,703
 Spirit; and he has come down at this time to preserve

31
00:04:13,703 --> 00:04:30,87
 your lives, that I might not slay you as I did your

32
00:04:30,87 --> 00:04:48,037
 brethren. Now this is the Great Spirit of whom

33
00:04:48,037 --> 00:05:05,204
 our fathers have spoken

34
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:07,015
5 Now this was the tradition of Lamoni, which he

35
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,158
 had received from his father, that there was a

36
00:05:08,158 --> 00:05:09,301
 Great Spirit. Notwithstanding they believed in a Great

37
00:05:09,301 --> 00:05:10,444
 Spirit, they supposed that whatsoever they did

38
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:11,587
 was right; nevertheless, Lamoni began to fear

39
00:05:11,587 --> 00:05:12,73
 exceedingly, with fear lest he had done wrong in slaying

40
00:05:12,73 --> 00:05:13,873
 his servants

41
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:14,097
6 For he had slain many of them because their

42
00:05:14,097 --> 00:05:14,347
 brethren had scattered their flocks at the place of

43
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:14,597
 water; and thus, because they had had their flocks

44
00:05:14,597 --> 00:05:14,847
 scattered they were slain

45
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:23,981
7 Now it was the practice of these Lamanites to

46
00:05:23,981 --> 00:05:33,581
 stand by the waters of Sebus to scatter the flocks

47
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:43,181
 of the people, that thereby they might drive away

48
00:05:43,181 --> 00:05:52,781
 many that were scattered unto their own land, it

49
00:05:52,781 --> 00:06:02,381
 being a practice of plunder among them

50
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:02,896
8 And it came to pass that king Lamoni inquired of

51
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:03,563
 his servants, saying: Where is this man that has

52
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:04,23
 such great power

53
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:08,931
9 And they said unto him: Behold, he is feeding

54
00:06:08,931 --> 00:06:13,431
 thy horses. Now the king had commanded his servants,

55
00:06:13,431 --> 00:06:17,931
 previous to the time of the watering of their

56
00:06:17,931 --> 00:06:22,431
 flocks, that they should prepare his horses and

57
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:26,931
 chariots, and conduct him forth to the land of Nephi;

58
00:06:26,931 --> 00:06:31,431
 for there had been a great feast appointed at the

59
00:06:31,431 --> 00:06:35,931
 land of Nephi, by the father of Lamoni, who was

60
00:06:35,931 --> 00:06:40,431
 king over all the land

61
00:06:40,4 --> 00:06:46,686
10 Now when king Lamoni heard that Ammon was

62
00:06:46,686 --> 00:06:52,972
 preparing his horses and his chariots he was more

63
00:06:52,972 --> 00:06:59,258
 astonished, because of the faithfulness of Ammon,

64
00:06:59,258 --> 00:07:05,544
 saying: Surely there has not been any servant among all

65
00:07:05,544 --> 00:07:11,83
 my servants that has been so faithful as this

66
00:07:11,83 --> 00:07:18,116
 man; for even he doth remember all my commandments to

67
00:07:18,116 --> 00:07:24,402
 execute them

68
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:30,278
11 Now I surely know that this is the Great

69
00:07:30,278 --> 00:07:35,611
 Spirit, and I would desire him that he come in unto me,

70
00:07:35,611 --> 00:07:40,944
 but I durst not

71
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:46,894
12 And it came to pass that when Ammon had made

72
00:07:46,894 --> 00:07:52,894
 ready the horses and the chariots for the king and

73
00:07:52,894 --> 00:07:58,894
 his servants, he went in unto the king, and he saw

74
00:07:58,894 --> 00:08:04,894
 that the countenance of the king was changed;

75
00:08:04,894 --> 00:08:10,894
 therefore he was about to return out of his presence

76
00:08:10,19 --> 00:08:16,99
13 And one of the king’s servants said unto him,

77
00:08:16,99 --> 00:08:23,79
 Rabbanah, which is, being interpreted, powerful or

78
00:08:23,79 --> 00:08:30,59
 great king, considering their kings to be

79
00:08:30,59 --> 00:08:37,39
 powerful; and thus he said unto him: Rabbanah, the king

80
00:08:37,39 --> 00:08:44,19
 desireth thee to stay

81
00:08:44,19 --> 00:08:48,99
14 Therefore Ammon turned himself unto the king,

82
00:08:48,99 --> 00:08:53,79
 and said unto him: What wilt thou that I should do

83
00:08:53,79 --> 00:08:58,59
 for thee, O king? And the king answered him not

84
00:08:58,59 --> 00:09:03,39
 for the space of an hour, according to their time,

85
00:09:03,39 --> 00:09:08,19
 for he knew not what he should say unto him

86
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:15,114
15 And it came to pass that Ammon said unto him

87
00:09:15,114 --> 00:09:22,114
 again: What desirest thou of me? But the king

88
00:09:22,114 --> 00:09:29,114
 answered him not

89
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:35,813
16 And it came to pass that Ammon, being filled

90
00:09:35,813 --> 00:09:41,924
 with the Spirit of God, therefore he perceived the

91
00:09:41,924 --> 00:09:48,035
 thoughts of the king. And he said unto him: Is it

92
00:09:48,035 --> 00:09:54,146
 because thou hast heard that I defended thy

93
00:09:54,146 --> 00:10:00,257
 servants and thy flocks, and slew seven of their brethren

94
00:10:00,257 --> 00:10:06,368
 with the sling and with the sword, and smote off

95
00:10:06,368 --> 00:10:12,479
 the arms of others, in order to defend thy flocks

96
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:18,59
 and thy servants; behold, is it this that causeth

97
00:10:18,59 --> 00:10:24,701
 thy marvelings

98
00:10:24,09 --> 00:10:30,09
17 I say unto you, what is it, that thy marvelings

99
00:10:30,09 --> 00:10:36,09
 are so great? Behold, I am a man, and am thy

100
00:10:36,09 --> 00:10:42,09
 servant; therefore, whatsoever thou desirest which is

101
00:10:42,09 --> 00:10:48,09
 right, that will I do

102
00:10:48,014 --> 00:11:06,514
18 Now when the king had heard these words, he

103
00:11:06,514 --> 00:11:25,014
 marveled again, for he beheld that Ammon could

104
00:11:25,014 --> 00:11:43,514
 discern his thoughts; but notwithstanding this, king

105
00:11:43,514 --> 00:12:02,014
 Lamoni did open his mouth, and said unto him: Who art

106
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:20,514
 thou? Art thou that Great Spirit, who knows all

107
00:12:20,514 --> 00:12:39,014
 things

108
00:12:39,659 --> 00:13:27,659
19 Ammon answered and said unto him: I am not

109
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:32,307
20 And the king said: How knowest thou the

110
00:13:32,307 --> 00:13:37,107
 thoughts of my heart? Thou mayest speak boldly, and tell

111
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:41,907
 me concerning these things; and also tell me by

112
00:13:41,907 --> 00:13:46,707
 what power ye slew and smote off the arms of my

113
00:13:46,707 --> 00:13:51,507
 brethren that scattered my flocks

114
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:54,098
21 And now, if thou wilt tell me concerning these

115
00:13:54,098 --> 00:13:56,765
 things, whatsoever thou desirest I will give unto

116
00:13:56,765 --> 00:13:59,432
 thee; and if it were needed, I would guard thee

117
00:13:59,432 --> 00:14:02,099
 with my armies; but I know that thou art more

118
00:14:02,099 --> 00:14:04,766
 powerful than all they; nevertheless, whatsoever thou

119
00:14:04,766 --> 00:14:07,433
 desirest of me I will grant it unto thee

120
00:14:07,38 --> 00:14:09,38
22 Now Ammon being wise, yet harmless, he said

121
00:14:09,38 --> 00:14:11,38
 unto Lamoni: Wilt thou hearken unto my words, if I

122
00:14:11,38 --> 00:14:13,38
 tell thee by what power I do these things? And this

123
00:14:13,38 --> 00:14:15,38
 is the thing that I desire of thee

124
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:20,688
23 And the king answered him, and said: Yea, I

125
00:14:20,688 --> 00:14:26,021
 will believe all thy words. And thus he was caught

126
00:14:26,021 --> 00:14:31,354
 with guile

127
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:36,637
24 And Ammon began to speak unto him with

128
00:14:36,637 --> 00:14:41,97
 boldness, and said unto him: Believest thou that there is

129
00:14:41,97 --> 00:14:47,303
 a God

130
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:51,253
25 And he answered, and said unto him: I do not

131
00:14:51,253 --> 00:14:55,253
 know what that meaneth

132
00:14:55,228 --> 00:15:19,228
26 And then Ammon said: Believest thou that there

133
00:15:19,228 --> 00:15:43,228
 is a Great Spirit

134
00:15:43,075 --> 00:16:22,075
27 And he said, Yea

135
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:30,949
28 And Ammon said: This is God. And Ammon said

136
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:38,949
 unto him again: Believest thou that this Great

137
00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:46,949
 Spirit, who is God, created all things which are in

138
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:54,949
 heaven and in the earth

139
00:16:54,847 --> 00:17:18,847
29 And he said: Yea, I believe that he created all

140
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:42,847
 things which are in the earth; but I do not know

141
00:17:42,847 --> 00:18:06,847
 the heavens

142
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,822
32 And Ammon said: Yea, and he looketh down upon

143
00:00:57,822 --> 00:00:59,822
 all the children of men; and he knows all the

144
00:00:59,822 --> 00:01:01,822
 thoughts and intents of the heart; for by his hand were

145
00:01:01,822 --> 00:01:03,822
 they all created from the beginning

146
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:43,797
33 And king Lamoni said: I believe all these

147
00:01:43,797 --> 00:02:23,797
 things which thou hast spoken. Art thou sent from God

148
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:42,743
34 Ammon said unto him: I am a man; and man in the

149
00:02:42,743 --> 00:03:01,943
 beginning was created after the image of God, and

150
00:03:01,943 --> 00:03:21,143
 I am called by his Holy Spirit to teach these

151
00:03:21,143 --> 00:03:40,343
 things unto this people, that they may be brought to

152
00:03:40,343 --> 00:03:59,543
 a knowledge of that which is just and true

153
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:09,906
35 And a portion of that Spirit dwelleth in me,

154
00:04:09,906 --> 00:04:20,573
 which giveth me knowledge, and also power according

155
00:04:20,573 --> 00:04:31,24
 to my faith and desires which are in God

156
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:36,138
36 Now when Ammon had said these words, he began

157
00:04:36,138 --> 00:04:41,138
 at the creation of the world, and also the creation

158
00:04:41,138 --> 00:04:46,138
 of Adam, and told him all the things concerning

159
00:04:46,138 --> 00:04:51,138
 the fall of man, and rehearsed and laid before him

160
00:04:51,138 --> 00:04:56,138
 the records and the holy scriptures of the people,

161
00:04:56,138 --> 00:05:01,138
 which had been spoken by the prophets, even down

162
00:05:01,138 --> 00:05:06,138
 to the time that their father, Lehi, left

163
00:05:06,138 --> 00:05:11,138
 Jerusalem

164
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:14,011
37 And he also rehearsed unto them (for it was

165
00:05:14,011 --> 00:05:17,011
 unto the king and to his servants) all the

166
00:05:17,011 --> 00:05:20,011
 journeyings of their fathers in the wilderness, and all

167
00:05:20,011 --> 00:05:23,011
 their sufferings with hunger and thirst, and their

168
00:05:23,011 --> 00:05:26,011
 travail, and so forth

169
00:05:26,96 --> 00:05:36,293
38 And he also rehearsed unto them concerning the

170
00:05:36,293 --> 00:05:45,626
 rebellions of Laman and Lemuel, and the sons of

171
00:05:45,626 --> 00:05:54,959
 Ishmael, yea, all their rebellions did he relate

172
00:05:54,959 --> 00:06:04,292
 unto them; and he expounded unto them all the records

173
00:06:04,292 --> 00:06:13,625
 and scriptures from the time that Lehi left

174
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:22,958
 Jerusalem down to the present time

175
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:25,449
39 But this is not all; for he expounded unto them

176
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:28,116
 the plan of redemption, which was prepared from

177
00:06:28,116 --> 00:06:30,783
 the foundation of the world; and he also made known

178
00:06:30,783 --> 00:06:33,45
 unto them concerning the coming of Christ, and

179
00:06:33,45 --> 00:06:36,117
 all the works of the Lord did he make known unto

180
00:06:36,117 --> 00:06:38,784
 them

181
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,399
40 And it came to pass that after he had said all

182
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:44,066
 these things, and expounded them to the king, that

183
00:06:44,066 --> 00:06:46,733
 the king believed all his words

184
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,706
41 And he began to cry unto the Lord, saying: O

185
00:06:48,706 --> 00:06:50,706
 Lord, have mercy; according to thy abundant mercy

186
00:06:50,706 --> 00:06:52,706
 which thou hast had upon the people of Nephi, have

187
00:06:52,706 --> 00:06:54,706
 upon me, and my people

188
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:58,681
42 And now, when he had said this, he fell unto

189
00:06:58,681 --> 00:07:02,681
 the earth, as if he were dead

190
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:02,799
43 And it came to pass that his servants took him

191
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:02,942
 and carried him in unto his wife, and laid him

192
00:07:02,942 --> 00:07:03,085
 upon a bed; and he lay as if he were dead for the

193
00:07:03,085 --> 00:07:03,228
 space of two days and two nights; and his wife, and

194
00:07:03,228 --> 00:07:03,371
 his sons, and his daughters mourned over him, after

195
00:07:03,371 --> 00:07:03,514
 the manner of the Lamanites, greatly lamenting

196
00:07:03,514 --> 00:07:03,657
 his loss.
