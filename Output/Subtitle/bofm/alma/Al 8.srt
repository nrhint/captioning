1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:10,6
Chapter 8 Alma preaches and baptizes in Melek—He

2
00:00:10,6 --> 00:00:21,2
 is rejected in Ammonihah and leaves—An angel

3
00:00:21,2 --> 00:00:31,8
 commands him to return and cry repentance unto the

4
00:00:31,8 --> 00:00:42,4
 people—He is received by Amulek, and the two of them

5
00:00:42,4 --> 00:00:53,0
 preach in Ammonihah. About 82 B.C.

6
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:58,403
1 And now it came to pass that Alma returned from

7
00:00:58,403 --> 00:01:03,653
 the land of Gideon, after having taught the people

8
00:01:03,653 --> 00:01:08,903
 of Gideon many things which cannot be written,

9
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:14,153
 having established the order of the church,

10
00:01:14,153 --> 00:01:19,403
 according as he had before done in the land of Zarahemla,

11
00:01:19,403 --> 00:01:24,653
 yea, he returned to his own house at Zarahemla to

12
00:01:24,653 --> 00:01:29,903
 rest himself from the labors which he had

13
00:01:29,903 --> 00:01:35,153
 performed

14
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:40,128
2 And thus ended the ninth year of the reign of

15
00:01:40,128 --> 00:01:45,128
 the judges over the people of Nephi

16
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:51,106
3 And it came to pass in the commencement of the

17
00:01:51,106 --> 00:01:56,273
 tenth year of the reign of the judges over the

18
00:01:56,273 --> 00:02:01,44
 people of Nephi, that Alma departed from thence and

19
00:02:01,44 --> 00:02:06,607
 took his journey over into the land of Melek, on the

20
00:02:06,607 --> 00:02:11,774
 west of the river Sidon, on the west by the

21
00:02:11,774 --> 00:02:16,941
 borders of the wilderness

22
00:02:16,77 --> 00:02:22,27
4 And he began to teach the people in the land of

23
00:02:22,27 --> 00:02:27,77
 Melek according to the holy order of God, by which

24
00:02:27,77 --> 00:02:33,27
 he had been called; and he began to teach the

25
00:02:33,27 --> 00:02:38,77
 people throughout all the land of Melek

26
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:43,492
5 And it came to pass that the people came to him

27
00:02:43,492 --> 00:02:48,492
 throughout all the borders of the land which was

28
00:02:48,492 --> 00:02:53,492
 by the wilderness side. And they were baptized

29
00:02:53,492 --> 00:02:58,492
 throughout all the land

30
00:02:58,045 --> 00:03:04,295
6 So that when he had finished his work at Melek

31
00:03:04,295 --> 00:03:10,545
 he departed thence, and traveled three days’

32
00:03:10,545 --> 00:03:16,795
 journey on the north of the land of Melek; and he came

33
00:03:16,795 --> 00:03:23,045
 to a city which was called Ammonihah

34
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:29,803
7 Now it was the custom of the people of Nephi to

35
00:03:29,803 --> 00:03:36,403
 call their lands, and their cities, and their

36
00:03:36,403 --> 00:03:43,003
 villages, yea, even all their small villages, after

37
00:03:43,003 --> 00:03:49,603
 the name of him who first possessed them; and thus

38
00:03:49,603 --> 00:03:56,203
 it was with the land of Ammonihah

39
00:03:56,002 --> 00:04:00,669
8 And it came to pass that when Alma had come to

40
00:04:00,669 --> 00:04:05,336
 the city of Ammonihah he began to preach the word

41
00:04:05,336 --> 00:04:10,003
 of God unto them

42
00:04:10,55 --> 00:04:17,217
9 Now Satan had gotten great hold upon the hearts

43
00:04:17,217 --> 00:04:23,884
 of the people of the city of Ammonihah; therefore

44
00:04:23,884 --> 00:04:30,551
 they would not hearken unto the words of Alma

45
00:04:30,57 --> 00:04:36,37
10 Nevertheless Alma labored much in the spirit,

46
00:04:36,37 --> 00:04:42,17
 wrestling with God in mighty prayer, that he would

47
00:04:42,17 --> 00:04:47,97
 pour out his Spirit upon the people who were in

48
00:04:47,97 --> 00:04:53,77
 the city; that he would also grant that he might

49
00:04:53,77 --> 00:04:59,57
 baptize them unto repentance

50
00:04:59,8 --> 00:05:05,657
11 Nevertheless, they hardened their hearts,

51
00:05:05,657 --> 00:05:11,514
 saying unto him: Behold, we know that thou art Alma;

52
00:05:11,514 --> 00:05:17,371
 and we know that thou art high priest over the

53
00:05:17,371 --> 00:05:23,228
 church which thou hast established in many parts of the

54
00:05:23,228 --> 00:05:29,085
 land, according to your tradition; and we are not

55
00:05:29,085 --> 00:05:34,942
 of thy church, and we do not believe in such

56
00:05:34,942 --> 00:05:40,799
 foolish traditions

57
00:05:40,54 --> 00:05:45,74
12 And now we know that because we are not of thy

58
00:05:45,74 --> 00:05:50,94
 church we know that thou hast no power over us;

59
00:05:50,94 --> 00:05:56,14
 and thou hast delivered up the judgment-seat unto

60
00:05:56,14 --> 00:06:01,34
 Nephihah; therefore thou art not the chief judge

61
00:06:01,34 --> 00:06:06,54
 over us

62
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:11,699
13 Now when the people had said this, and

63
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:17,299
 withstood all his words, and reviled him, and spit upon

64
00:06:17,299 --> 00:06:22,899
 him, and caused that he should be cast out of their

65
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:28,499
 city, he departed thence and took his journey

66
00:06:28,499 --> 00:06:34,099
 towards the city which was called Aaron

67
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:35,971
14 And it came to pass that while he was

68
00:06:35,971 --> 00:06:37,114
 journeying thither, being weighed down with sorrow, wading

69
00:06:37,114 --> 00:06:38,257
 through much tribulation and anguish of soul,

70
00:06:38,257 --> 00:06:39,4
 because of the wickedness of the people who were in

71
00:06:39,4 --> 00:06:40,543
 the city of Ammonihah, it came to pass while Alma

72
00:06:40,543 --> 00:06:41,686
 was thus weighed down with sorrow, behold an angel

73
00:06:41,686 --> 00:06:42,829
 of the Lord appeared unto him, saying

74
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:53,969
15 Blessed art thou, Alma; therefore, lift up thy

75
00:06:53,969 --> 00:07:05,136
 head and rejoice, for thou hast great cause to

76
00:07:05,136 --> 00:07:16,303
 rejoice; for thou hast been faithful in keeping the

77
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:27,47
 commandments of God from the time which thou

78
00:07:27,47 --> 00:07:38,637
 receivedst thy first message from him. Behold, I am he

79
00:07:38,637 --> 00:07:49,804
 that delivered it unto you

80
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:55,036
16 And behold, I am sent to command thee that thou

81
00:07:55,036 --> 00:08:00,636
 return to the city of Ammonihah, and preach again

82
00:08:00,636 --> 00:08:06,236
 unto the people of the city; yea, preach unto

83
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:11,836
 them. Yea, say unto them, except they repent the Lord

84
00:08:11,836 --> 00:08:17,436
 God will destroy them

85
00:08:17,13 --> 00:08:22,93
17 For behold, they do study at this time that

86
00:08:22,93 --> 00:08:28,73
 they may destroy the liberty of thy people, (for thus

87
00:08:28,73 --> 00:08:34,53
 saith the Lord) which is contrary to the

88
00:08:34,53 --> 00:08:40,33
 statutes, and judgments, and commandments which he has

89
00:08:40,33 --> 00:08:46,13
 given unto his people

90
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:51,126
18 Now it came to pass that after Alma had

91
00:08:51,126 --> 00:08:56,126
 received his message from the angel of the Lord he

92
00:08:56,126 --> 00:09:01,126
 returned speedily to the land of Ammonihah. And he

93
00:09:01,126 --> 00:09:06,126
 entered the city by another way, yea, by the way which

94
00:09:06,126 --> 00:09:11,126
 is on the south of the city of Ammonihah

95
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:17,951
19 And as he entered the city he was an hungered,

96
00:09:17,951 --> 00:09:24,284
 and he said to a man: Will ye give to an humble

97
00:09:24,284 --> 00:09:30,617
 servant of God something to eat

98
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:36,032
20 And the man said unto him: I am a Nephite, and

99
00:09:36,032 --> 00:09:41,461
 I know that thou art a holy prophet of God, for

100
00:09:41,461 --> 00:09:46,89
 thou art the man whom an angel said in a vision:

101
00:09:46,89 --> 00:09:52,319
 Thou shalt receive. Therefore, go with me into my

102
00:09:52,319 --> 00:09:57,748
 house and I will impart unto thee of my food; and I

103
00:09:57,748 --> 00:10:03,177
 know that thou wilt be a blessing unto me and my

104
00:10:03,177 --> 00:10:08,606
 house

105
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:13,325
21 And it came to pass that the man received him

106
00:10:13,325 --> 00:10:18,075
 into his house; and the man was called Amulek; and

107
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:22,825
 he brought forth bread and meat and set before

108
00:10:22,825 --> 00:10:27,575
 Alma

109
00:10:27,36 --> 00:10:32,693
22 And it came to pass that Alma ate bread and was

110
00:10:32,693 --> 00:10:38,026
 filled; and he blessed Amulek and his house, and

111
00:10:38,026 --> 00:10:43,359
 he gave thanks unto God

112
00:10:43,71 --> 00:10:50,043
23 And after he had eaten and was filled he said

113
00:10:50,043 --> 00:10:56,376
 unto Amulek: I am Alma, and am the high priest over

114
00:10:56,376 --> 00:11:02,709
 the church of God throughout the land

115
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:08,462
24 And behold, I have been called to preach the

116
00:11:08,462 --> 00:11:13,962
 word of God among all this people, according to the

117
00:11:13,962 --> 00:11:19,462
 spirit of revelation and prophecy; and I was in

118
00:11:19,462 --> 00:11:24,962
 this land and they would not receive me, but they

119
00:11:24,962 --> 00:11:30,462
 cast me out and I was about to set my back towards

120
00:11:30,462 --> 00:11:35,962
 this land forever

121
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:40,211
25 But behold, I have been commanded that I should

122
00:11:40,211 --> 00:11:44,961
 turn again and prophesy unto this people, yea,

123
00:11:44,961 --> 00:11:49,711
 and to testify against them concerning their

124
00:11:49,711 --> 00:11:54,461
 iniquities

125
00:11:54,48 --> 00:12:02,48
26 And now, Amulek, because thou hast fed me and

126
00:12:02,48 --> 00:12:10,48
 taken me in, thou art blessed; for I was an

127
00:12:10,48 --> 00:12:18,48
 hungered, for I had fasted many days

128
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:24,404
27 And Alma tarried many days with Amulek before

129
00:12:24,404 --> 00:12:30,404
 he began to preach unto the people

130
00:12:30,85 --> 00:12:35,35
28 And it came to pass that the people did wax

131
00:12:35,35 --> 00:12:39,85
 more gross in their iniquities

132
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:47,292
29 And the word came to Alma, saying: Go; and also

133
00:12:47,292 --> 00:12:54,625
 say unto my servant Amulek, go forth and prophesy

134
00:12:54,625 --> 00:13:01,958
 unto this people, saying—Repent ye, for thus

135
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:09,291
 saith the Lord, except ye repent I will visit this

136
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:16,624
 people in mine anger; yea, and I will not turn my

137
00:13:16,624 --> 00:13:23,957
 fierce anger away

138
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:25,335
30 And Alma went forth, and also Amulek, among the

139
00:13:25,335 --> 00:13:27,668
 people, to declare the words of God unto them;

140
00:13:27,668 --> 00:13:30,001
 and they were filled with the Holy Ghost

141
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:37,691
31 And they had power given unto them, insomuch

142
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:44,405
 that they could not be confined in dungeons; neither

143
00:13:44,405 --> 00:13:51,119
 was it possible that any man could slay them;

144
00:13:51,119 --> 00:13:57,833
 nevertheless they did not exercise their power until

145
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:04,547
 they were bound in bands and cast into prison.

146
00:14:04,547 --> 00:14:11,261
 Now, this was done that the Lord might show forth his

147
00:14:11,261 --> 00:14:17,975
 power in them

148
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:22,523
32 And it came to pass that they went forth and

149
00:14:22,523 --> 00:14:28,023
 began to preach and to prophesy unto the people,

150
00:14:28,023 --> 00:14:33,523
 according to the spirit and power which the Lord had

151
00:14:33,523 --> 00:14:39,023
 given them.
