1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:19,0
The commandments of Alma to his son Shiblon.

2
00:00:19,0 --> 00:00:38,0
 Comprising chapter 38.Chapter 38 Shiblon was persecuted

3
00:00:38,0 --> 00:00:57,0
 for righteousness’ sake—Salvation is in Christ,

4
00:00:57,0 --> 00:01:16,0
 who is the life and the light of the world—Bridle

5
00:01:16,0 --> 00:01:35,0
 all your passions. About 74 B.C.

6
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:35,863
1 My son, give ear to my words, for I say unto

7
00:01:35,863 --> 00:01:36,03
 you, even as I said unto Helaman, that inasmuch as ye

8
00:01:36,03 --> 00:01:36,197
 shall keep the commandments of God ye shall

9
00:01:36,197 --> 00:01:36,364
 prosper in the land; and inasmuch as ye will not keep

10
00:01:36,364 --> 00:01:36,531
 the commandments of God ye shall be cut off from

11
00:01:36,531 --> 00:01:36,698
 his presence

12
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:41,32
2 And now, my son, I trust that I shall have great

13
00:01:41,32 --> 00:01:46,177
 joy in you, because of your steadiness and your

14
00:01:46,177 --> 00:01:51,034
 faithfulness unto God; for as you have commenced in

15
00:01:51,034 --> 00:01:55,891
 your youth to look to the Lord your God, even so

16
00:01:55,891 --> 00:02:00,748
 I hope that you will continue in keeping his

17
00:02:00,748 --> 00:02:05,605
 commandments; for blessed is he that endureth to the

18
00:02:05,605 --> 00:02:10,462
 end

19
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:18,014
3 I say unto you, my son, that I have had great

20
00:02:18,014 --> 00:02:25,264
 joy in thee already, because of thy faithfulness and

21
00:02:25,264 --> 00:02:32,514
 thy diligence, and thy patience and thy

22
00:02:32,514 --> 00:02:39,764
 long-suffering among the people of the Zoramites

23
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:55,393
4 For I know that thou wast in bonds; yea, and I

24
00:02:55,393 --> 00:03:11,393
 also know that thou wast stoned for the word’s

25
00:03:11,393 --> 00:03:27,393
 sake; and thou didst bear all these things with

26
00:03:27,393 --> 00:03:43,393
 patience because the Lord was with thee; and now thou

27
00:03:43,393 --> 00:03:59,393
 knowest that the Lord did deliver thee

28
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:14,939
5 And now my son, Shiblon, I would that ye should

29
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:30,739
 remember, that as much as ye shall put your trust

30
00:04:30,739 --> 00:04:46,539
 in God even so much ye shall be delivered out of

31
00:04:46,539 --> 00:05:02,339
 your trials, and your troubles, and your

32
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:18,139
 afflictions, and ye shall be lifted up at the last day

33
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:26,885
6 Now, my son, I would not that ye should think

34
00:05:26,885 --> 00:05:34,885
 that I know these things of myself, but it is the

35
00:05:34,885 --> 00:05:42,885
 Spirit of God which is in me which maketh these

36
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:50,885
 things known unto me; for if I had not been born of

37
00:05:50,885 --> 00:05:58,885
 God I should not have known these things

38
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:13,425
7 But behold, the Lord in his great mercy sent his

39
00:06:13,425 --> 00:06:28,092
 angel to declare unto me that I must stop the

40
00:06:28,092 --> 00:06:42,759
 work of destruction among his people; yea, and I have

41
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:57,426
 seen an angel face to face, and he spake with me,

42
00:06:57,426 --> 00:07:12,093
 and his voice was as thunder, and it shook the

43
00:07:12,093 --> 00:07:26,76
 whole earth

44
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,812
8 And it came to pass that I was three days and

45
00:07:31,812 --> 00:07:37,145
 three nights in the most bitter pain and anguish of

46
00:07:37,145 --> 00:07:42,478
 soul; and never, until I did cry out unto the Lord

47
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:47,811
 Jesus Christ for mercy, did I receive a remission

48
00:07:47,811 --> 00:07:53,144
 of my sins. But behold, I did cry unto him and I

49
00:07:53,144 --> 00:07:58,477
 did find peace to my soul

50
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:38,363
11 See that ye are not lifted up unto pride; yea,

51
00:01:38,363 --> 00:01:41,03
 see that ye do not boast in your own wisdom, nor

52
00:01:41,03 --> 00:01:43,697
 of your much strength

53
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:59,67
12 Use boldness, but not overbearance; and also

54
00:01:59,67 --> 00:02:15,67
 see that ye bridle all your passions, that ye may be

55
00:02:15,67 --> 00:02:31,67
 filled with love; see that ye refrain from

56
00:02:31,67 --> 00:02:47,67
 idleness

57
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:35,946
15 And may the Lord bless your soul, and receive

58
00:01:35,946 --> 00:01:36,196
 you at the last day into his kingdom, to sit down

59
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:36,446
 in peace. Now go, my son, and teach the word unto

60
00:01:36,446 --> 00:01:36,696
 this people. Be sober. My son, farewell.
