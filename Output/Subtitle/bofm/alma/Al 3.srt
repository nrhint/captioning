1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:10,2
Chapter 3 The Amlicites had marked themselves

2
00:00:10,2 --> 00:00:20,4
 according to the prophetic word—The Lamanites had been

3
00:00:20,4 --> 00:00:30,6
 cursed for their rebellion—Men bring their own

4
00:00:30,6 --> 00:00:40,8
 curses upon themselves—The Nephites defeat another

5
00:00:40,8 --> 00:00:51,0
 Lamanite army. About 87–86 B.C.

6
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:57,985
1 And it came to pass that the Nephites who were

7
00:00:57,985 --> 00:01:03,985
 not slain by the weapons of war, after having

8
00:01:03,985 --> 00:01:09,985
 buried those who had been slain—now the number of the

9
00:01:09,985 --> 00:01:15,985
 slain were not numbered, because of the greatness

10
00:01:15,985 --> 00:01:21,985
 of their number—after they had finished burying

11
00:01:21,985 --> 00:01:27,985
 their dead they all returned to their lands, and to

12
00:01:27,985 --> 00:01:33,985
 their houses, and their wives, and their children

13
00:01:33,46 --> 00:01:39,46
2 Now many women and children had been slain with

14
00:01:39,46 --> 00:01:45,46
 the sword, and also many of their flocks and their

15
00:01:45,46 --> 00:01:51,46
 herds; and also many of their fields of grain

16
00:01:51,46 --> 00:01:57,46
 were destroyed, for they were trodden down by the

17
00:01:57,46 --> 00:02:03,46
 hosts of men

18
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:10,024
3 And now as many of the Lamanites and the

19
00:02:10,024 --> 00:02:16,424
 Amlicites who had been slain upon the bank of the river

20
00:02:16,424 --> 00:02:22,824
 Sidon were cast into the waters of Sidon; and

21
00:02:22,824 --> 00:02:29,224
 behold their bones are in the depths of the sea, and

22
00:02:29,224 --> 00:02:35,624
 they are many

23
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:40,488
4 And the Amlicites were distinguished from the

24
00:02:40,488 --> 00:02:45,888
 Nephites, for they had marked themselves with red in

25
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:51,288
 their foreheads after the manner of the

26
00:02:51,288 --> 00:02:56,688
 Lamanites; nevertheless they had not shorn their heads like

27
00:02:56,688 --> 00:03:02,088
 unto the Lamanites

28
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:07,649
5 Now the heads of the Lamanites were shorn; and

29
00:03:07,649 --> 00:03:13,149
 they were naked, save it were skin which was girded

30
00:03:13,149 --> 00:03:18,649
 about their loins, and also their armor, which

31
00:03:18,649 --> 00:03:24,149
 was girded about them, and their bows, and their

32
00:03:24,149 --> 00:03:29,649
 arrows, and their stones, and their slings, and so

33
00:03:29,649 --> 00:03:35,149
 forth

34
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:41,315
6 And the skins of the Lamanites were dark,

35
00:03:41,315 --> 00:03:47,482
 according to the mark which was set upon their fathers,

36
00:03:47,482 --> 00:03:53,649
 which was a curse upon them because of their

37
00:03:53,649 --> 00:03:59,816
 transgression and their rebellion against their

38
00:03:59,816 --> 00:04:05,983
 brethren, who consisted of Nephi, Jacob, and Joseph, and

39
00:04:05,983 --> 00:04:12,15
 Sam, who were just and holy men

40
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:20,602
7 And their brethren sought to destroy them,

41
00:04:20,602 --> 00:04:28,852
 therefore they were cursed; and the Lord God set a mark

42
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:37,102
 upon them, yea, upon Laman and Lemuel, and also

43
00:04:37,102 --> 00:04:45,352
 the sons of Ishmael, and Ishmaelitish women

44
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:51,785
8 And this was done that their seed might be

45
00:04:51,785 --> 00:04:58,385
 distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that

46
00:04:58,385 --> 00:05:04,985
 thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that

47
00:05:04,985 --> 00:05:11,585
 they might not mix and believe in incorrect

48
00:05:11,585 --> 00:05:18,185
 traditions which would prove their destruction

49
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:24,586
9 And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle

50
00:05:24,586 --> 00:05:30,253
 his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the

51
00:05:30,253 --> 00:05:35,92
 same curse upon his seed

52
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:40,835
10 Therefore, whosoever suffered himself to be led

53
00:05:40,835 --> 00:05:46,168
 away by the Lamanites was called under that head,

54
00:05:46,168 --> 00:05:51,501
 and there was a mark set upon him

55
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:56,218
11 And it came to pass that whosoever would not

56
00:05:56,218 --> 00:06:01,218
 believe in the tradition of the Lamanites, but

57
00:06:01,218 --> 00:06:06,218
 believed those records which were brought out of the

58
00:06:06,218 --> 00:06:11,218
 land of Jerusalem, and also in the tradition of

59
00:06:11,218 --> 00:06:16,218
 their fathers, which were correct, who believed in the

60
00:06:16,218 --> 00:06:21,218
 commandments of God and kept them, were called

61
00:06:21,218 --> 00:06:26,218
 the Nephites, or the people of Nephi, from that time

62
00:06:26,218 --> 00:06:31,218
 forth

63
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:36,424
12 And it is they who have kept the records which

64
00:06:36,424 --> 00:06:41,757
 are true of their people, and also of the people

65
00:06:41,757 --> 00:06:47,09
 of the Lamanites

66
00:06:47,04 --> 00:06:52,79
13 Now we will return again to the Amlicites, for

67
00:06:52,79 --> 00:06:58,54
 they also had a mark set upon them; yea, they set

68
00:06:58,54 --> 00:07:04,29
 the mark upon themselves, yea, even a mark of red

69
00:07:04,29 --> 00:07:10,04
 upon their foreheads

70
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:17,506
14 Thus the word of God is fulfilled, for these

71
00:07:17,506 --> 00:07:24,649
 are the words which he said to Nephi: Behold, the

72
00:07:24,649 --> 00:07:31,792
 Lamanites have I cursed, and I will set a mark on

73
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:38,935
 them that they and their seed may be separated from

74
00:07:38,935 --> 00:07:46,078
 thee and thy seed, from this time henceforth and

75
00:07:46,078 --> 00:07:53,221
 forever, except they repent of their wickedness and

76
00:07:53,221 --> 00:08:00,364
 turn to me that I may have mercy upon them

77
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:05,579
15 And again: I will set a mark upon him that

78
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:10,912
 mingleth his seed with thy brethren, that they may be

79
00:08:10,912 --> 00:08:16,245
 cursed also

80
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:23,096
16 And again: I will set a mark upon him that

81
00:08:23,096 --> 00:08:29,596
 fighteth against thee and thy seed

82
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:36,876
17 And again, I say he that departeth from thee

83
00:08:36,876 --> 00:08:44,276
 shall no more be called thy seed; and I will bless

84
00:08:44,276 --> 00:08:51,676
 thee, and whomsoever shall be called thy seed,

85
00:08:51,676 --> 00:08:59,076
 henceforth and forever; and these were the promises of

86
00:08:59,076 --> 00:09:06,476
 the Lord unto Nephi and to his seed

87
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:11,346
18 Now the Amlicites knew not that they were

88
00:09:11,346 --> 00:09:16,013
 fulfilling the words of God when they began to mark

89
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:20,68
 themselves in their foreheads; nevertheless they had

90
00:09:20,68 --> 00:09:25,347
 come out in open rebellion against God; therefore

91
00:09:25,347 --> 00:09:30,014
 it was expedient that the curse should fall upon

92
00:09:30,014 --> 00:09:34,681
 them

93
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:38,874
19 Now I would that ye should see that they

94
00:09:38,874 --> 00:09:43,374
 brought upon themselves the curse; and even so doth

95
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:47,874
 every man that is cursed bring upon himself his own

96
00:09:47,874 --> 00:09:52,374
 condemnation

97
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:58,093
20 Now it came to pass that not many days after

98
00:09:58,093 --> 00:10:03,26
 the battle which was fought in the land of

99
00:10:03,26 --> 00:10:08,427
 Zarahemla, by the Lamanites and the Amlicites, that there

100
00:10:08,427 --> 00:10:13,594
 was another army of the Lamanites came in upon the

101
00:10:13,594 --> 00:10:18,761
 people of Nephi, in the same place where the first

102
00:10:18,761 --> 00:10:23,928
 army met the Amlicites

103
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:28,857
21 And it came to pass that there was an army sent

104
00:10:28,857 --> 00:10:33,857
 to drive them out of their land

105
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:38,867
22 Now Alma himself being afflicted with a wound

106
00:10:38,867 --> 00:10:43,867
 did not go up to battle at this time against the

107
00:10:43,867 --> 00:10:48,867
 Lamanites

108
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:53,681
23 But he sent up a numerous army against them;

109
00:10:53,681 --> 00:10:59,181
 and they went up and slew many of the Lamanites, and

110
00:10:59,181 --> 00:11:04,681
 drove the remainder of them out of the borders of

111
00:11:04,681 --> 00:11:10,181
 their land

112
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:16,103
24 And then they returned again and began to

113
00:11:16,103 --> 00:11:21,77
 establish peace in the land, being troubled no more for

114
00:11:21,77 --> 00:11:27,437
 a time with their enemies

115
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:33,154
25 Now all these things were done, yea, all these

116
00:11:33,154 --> 00:11:38,821
 wars and contentions were commenced and ended in

117
00:11:38,821 --> 00:11:44,488
 the fifth year of the reign of the judges

118
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:50,771
26 And in one year were thousands and tens of

119
00:11:50,771 --> 00:11:56,771
 thousands of souls sent to the eternal world, that

120
00:11:56,771 --> 00:12:02,771
 they might reap their rewards according to their

121
00:12:02,771 --> 00:12:08,771
 works, whether they were good or whether they were

122
00:12:08,771 --> 00:12:14,771
 bad, to reap eternal happiness or eternal misery,

123
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:20,771
 according to the spirit which they listed to obey,

124
00:12:20,771 --> 00:12:26,771
 whether it be a good spirit or a bad one

125
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,079
27 For every man receiveth wages of him whom he

126
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,079
 listeth to obey, and this according to the words of

127
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,079
 the spirit of prophecy; therefore let it be

128
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,079
 according to the truth. And thus endeth the fifth year

129
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,079
 of the reign of the judges.
