1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:15,308
An account of the sons of Mosiah, who rejected

2
00:00:15,308 --> 00:00:30,616
 their rights to the kingdom for the word of God, and

3
00:00:30,616 --> 00:00:45,924
 went up to the land of Nephi to preach to the

4
00:00:45,924 --> 00:01:01,232
 Lamanites; their sufferings and deliverance—according

5
00:01:01,232 --> 00:01:16,54
 to the record of Alma. Comprising chapters 17

6
00:01:16,54 --> 00:01:31,848
 through 27.Chapter 17 The sons of Mosiah have the

7
00:01:31,848 --> 00:01:47,156
 spirit of prophecy and of revelation—They go their

8
00:01:47,156 --> 00:02:02,464
 several ways to declare the word to the

9
00:02:02,464 --> 00:02:17,772
 Lamanites—Ammon goes to the land of Ishmael and becomes the

10
00:02:17,772 --> 00:02:33,08
 servant of King Lamoni—Ammon saves the king’s flocks

11
00:02:33,08 --> 00:02:48,388
 and slays his enemies at the water of Sebus.

12
00:02:48,388 --> 00:03:03,696
Verses 1–3, about 77 B.C.; 
verse 4, about 91–77 B.C.;

13
00:03:03,696 --> 00:03:19,004
 and 
verses 5–39, about 91 B.C.

14
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,966
1 And now it came to pass that as Alma was

15
00:03:20,966 --> 00:03:22,566
 journeying from the land of Gideon southward, away to the

16
00:03:22,566 --> 00:03:24,166
 land of Manti, behold, to his astonishment, he

17
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,766
 met with the sons of Mosiah journeying towards the

18
00:03:25,766 --> 00:03:27,366
 land of Zarahemla

19
00:03:27,34 --> 00:03:29,007
2 Now these sons of Mosiah were with Alma at the

20
00:03:29,007 --> 00:03:30,674
 time the angel first appeared unto him; therefore

21
00:03:30,674 --> 00:03:32,341
 Alma did rejoice exceedingly to see his brethren;

22
00:03:32,341 --> 00:03:34,008
 and what added more to his joy, they were still his

23
00:03:34,008 --> 00:03:35,675
 brethren in the Lord; yea, and they had waxed

24
00:03:35,675 --> 00:03:37,342
 strong in the knowledge of the truth; for they were

25
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,009
 men of a sound understanding and they had searched

26
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:40,676
 the scriptures diligently, that they might know

27
00:03:40,676 --> 00:03:42,343
 the word of God

28
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:49,223
3 But this is not all; they had given themselves

29
00:03:49,223 --> 00:03:55,623
 to much prayer, and fasting; therefore they had the

30
00:03:55,623 --> 00:04:02,023
 spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of revelation,

31
00:04:02,023 --> 00:04:08,423
 and when they taught, they taught with power and

32
00:04:08,423 --> 00:04:14,823
 authority of God

33
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:27,392
4 And they had been teaching the word of God for

34
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:39,963
 the space of fourteen years among the Lamanites,

35
00:04:39,963 --> 00:04:52,534
 having had much success in bringing many to the

36
00:04:52,534 --> 00:05:05,105
 knowledge of the truth; yea, by the power of their

37
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:17,676
 words many were brought before the altar of God, to

38
00:05:17,676 --> 00:05:30,247
 call on his name and confess their sins before him

39
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:42,818


40
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:52,142
5 Now these are the circumstances which attended

41
00:05:52,142 --> 00:06:01,742
 them in their journeyings, for they had many

42
00:06:01,742 --> 00:06:11,342
 afflictions; they did suffer much, both in body and in

43
00:06:11,342 --> 00:06:20,942
 mind, such as hunger, thirst and fatigue, and also

44
00:06:20,942 --> 00:06:30,542
 much labor in the spirit

45
00:06:30,39 --> 00:06:35,19
6 Now these were their journeyings: Having taken

46
00:06:35,19 --> 00:06:39,99
 leave of their father, Mosiah, in the first year of

47
00:06:39,99 --> 00:06:44,79
 the judges; having refused the kingdom which

48
00:06:44,79 --> 00:06:49,59
 their father was desirous to confer upon them, and

49
00:06:49,59 --> 00:06:54,39
 also this was the minds of the people

50
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:57,514
7 Nevertheless they departed out of the land of

51
00:06:57,514 --> 00:07:00,714
 Zarahemla, and took their swords, and their spears,

52
00:07:00,714 --> 00:07:03,914
 and their bows, and their arrows, and their

53
00:07:03,914 --> 00:07:07,114
 slings; and this they did that they might provide food

54
00:07:07,114 --> 00:07:10,314
 for themselves while in the wilderness

55
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:10,513
8 And thus they departed into the wilderness with

56
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:10,763
 their numbers which they had selected, to go up to

57
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:11,013
 the land of Nephi, to preach the word of God unto

58
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:11,263
 the Lamanites

59
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:14,287
9 And it came to pass that they journeyed many

60
00:07:14,287 --> 00:07:17,176
 days in the wilderness, and they fasted much and

61
00:07:17,176 --> 00:07:20,065
 prayed much that the Lord would grant unto them a

62
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,954
 portion of his Spirit to go with them, and abide with

63
00:07:22,954 --> 00:07:25,843
 them, that they might be an instrument in the

64
00:07:25,843 --> 00:07:28,732
 hands of God to bring, if it were possible, their

65
00:07:28,732 --> 00:07:31,621
 brethren, the Lamanites, to the knowledge of the

66
00:07:31,621 --> 00:07:34,51
 truth, to the knowledge of the baseness of the

67
00:07:34,51 --> 00:07:37,399
 traditions of their fathers, which were not correct

68
00:07:37,39 --> 00:08:14,723
10 And it came to pass that the Lord did visit

69
00:08:14,723 --> 00:08:52,056
 them with his Spirit, and said unto them: Be

70
00:08:52,056 --> 00:09:29,389
 comforted. And they were comforted

71
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:43,749
11 And the Lord said unto them also: Go forth

72
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:58,463
 among the Lamanites, thy brethren, and establish my

73
00:09:58,463 --> 00:10:13,177
 word; yet ye shall be patient in long-suffering and

74
00:10:13,177 --> 00:10:27,891
 afflictions, that ye may show forth good examples

75
00:10:27,891 --> 00:10:42,605
 unto them in me, and I will make an instrument of

76
00:10:42,605 --> 00:10:57,319
 thee in my hands unto the salvation of many souls

77
00:10:57,319 --> 00:11:12,033


78
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:32,705
12 And it came to pass that the hearts of the sons

79
00:11:32,705 --> 00:11:52,705
 of Mosiah, and also those who were with them,

80
00:11:52,705 --> 00:12:12,705
 took courage to go forth unto the Lamanites to

81
00:12:12,705 --> 00:12:32,705
 declare unto them the word of God

82
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:35,881
13 And it came to pass when they had arrived in

83
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:39,31
 the borders of the land of the Lamanites, that they

84
00:12:39,31 --> 00:12:42,739
 separated themselves and departed one from

85
00:12:42,739 --> 00:12:46,168
 another, trusting in the Lord that they should meet again

86
00:12:46,168 --> 00:12:49,597
 at the close of their harvest; for they supposed

87
00:12:49,597 --> 00:12:53,026
 that great was the work which they had undertaken

88
00:12:53,026 --> 00:12:56,455


89
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:57,265
14 And assuredly it was great, for they had

90
00:12:57,265 --> 00:12:58,154
 undertaken to preach the word of God to a wild and a

91
00:12:58,154 --> 00:12:59,043
 hardened and a ferocious people; a people who

92
00:12:59,043 --> 00:12:59,932
 delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and

93
00:12:59,932 --> 00:13:00,821
 plundering them; and their hearts were set upon

94
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:01,71
 riches, or upon gold and silver, and precious stones;

95
00:13:01,71 --> 00:13:02,599
 yet they sought to obtain these things by murdering

96
00:13:02,599 --> 00:13:03,488
 and plundering, that they might not labor for them

97
00:13:03,488 --> 00:13:04,377
 with their own hands

98
00:13:04,35 --> 00:13:05,683
15 Thus they were a very indolent people, many of

99
00:13:05,683 --> 00:13:07,016
 whom did worship idols, and the curse of God had

100
00:13:07,016 --> 00:13:08,349
 fallen upon them because of the traditions of their

101
00:13:08,349 --> 00:13:09,682
 fathers; notwithstanding the promises of the Lord

102
00:13:09,682 --> 00:13:11,015
 were extended unto them on the conditions of

103
00:13:11,015 --> 00:13:12,348
 repentance

104
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:15,525
16 Therefore, this was the cause for which the

105
00:13:15,525 --> 00:13:18,725
 sons of Mosiah had undertaken the work, that perhaps

106
00:13:18,725 --> 00:13:21,925
 they might bring them unto repentance; that

107
00:13:21,925 --> 00:13:25,125
 perhaps they might bring them to know of the plan of

108
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:28,325
 redemption

109
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,274
17 Therefore they separated themselves one from

110
00:13:30,274 --> 00:13:32,274
 another, and went forth among them, every man alone,

111
00:13:32,274 --> 00:13:34,274
 according to the word and power of God which was

112
00:13:34,274 --> 00:13:36,274
 given unto him

113
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:38,535
18 Now Ammon being the chief among them, or rather

114
00:13:38,535 --> 00:13:40,821
 he did administer unto them, and he departed from

115
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:43,107
 them, after having blessed them according to

116
00:13:43,107 --> 00:13:45,393
 their several stations, having imparted the word of

117
00:13:45,393 --> 00:13:47,679
 God unto them, or administered unto them before his

118
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:49,965
 departure; and thus they took their several

119
00:13:49,965 --> 00:13:52,251
 journeys throughout the land

120
00:13:52,198 --> 00:14:00,198
19 And Ammon went to the land of Ishmael, the land

121
00:14:00,198 --> 00:14:08,198
 being called after the sons of Ishmael, who also

122
00:14:08,198 --> 00:14:16,198
 became Lamanites

123
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:18,122
20 And as Ammon entered the land of Ishmael, the

124
00:14:18,122 --> 00:14:20,122
 Lamanites took him and bound him, as was their

125
00:14:20,122 --> 00:14:22,122
 custom to bind all the Nephites who fell into their

126
00:14:22,122 --> 00:14:24,122
 hands, and carry them before the king; and thus it

127
00:14:24,122 --> 00:14:26,122
 was left to the pleasure of the king to slay them,

128
00:14:26,122 --> 00:14:28,122
 or to retain them in captivity, or to cast them

129
00:14:28,122 --> 00:14:30,122
 into prison, or to cast them out of his land,

130
00:14:30,122 --> 00:14:32,122
 according to his will and pleasure

131
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:42,404
21 And thus Ammon was carried before the king who

132
00:14:42,404 --> 00:14:52,737
 was over the land of Ishmael; and his name was

133
00:14:52,737 --> 00:15:03,07
 Lamoni; and he was a descendant of Ishmael

134
00:15:03,97 --> 00:15:06,637
22 And the king inquired of Ammon if it were his

135
00:15:06,637 --> 00:15:09,304
 desire to dwell in the land among the Lamanites, or

136
00:15:09,304 --> 00:15:11,971
 among his people

137
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:17,277
23 And Ammon said unto him: Yea, I desire to dwell

138
00:15:17,277 --> 00:15:22,61
 among this people for a time; yea, and perhaps

139
00:15:22,61 --> 00:15:27,943
 until the day I die

140
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:31,894
24 And it came to pass that king Lamoni was much

141
00:15:31,894 --> 00:15:35,894
 pleased with Ammon, and caused that his bands

142
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:39,894
 should be loosed; and he would that Ammon should take

143
00:15:39,894 --> 00:15:43,894
 one of his daughters to wife

144
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:44,043
25 But Ammon said unto him: Nay, but I will be thy

145
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:44,243
 servant. Therefore Ammon became a servant to king

146
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:44,443
 Lamoni. And it came to pass that he was set among

147
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:44,643
 other servants to watch the flocks of Lamoni,

148
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:44,843
 according to the custom of the Lamanites

149
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:47,243
26 And after he had been in the service of the

150
00:15:47,243 --> 00:15:50,243
 king three days, as he was with the Lamanitish

151
00:15:50,243 --> 00:15:53,243
 servants going forth with their flocks to the place of

152
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:56,243
 water, which was called the water of Sebus, and all

153
00:15:56,243 --> 00:15:59,243
 the Lamanites drive their flocks hither, that

154
00:15:59,243 --> 00:16:02,243
 they may have water

155
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:09,075
27 Therefore, as Ammon and the servants of the

156
00:16:09,075 --> 00:16:15,789
 king were driving forth their flocks to this place of

157
00:16:15,789 --> 00:16:22,503
 water, behold, a certain number of the Lamanites,

158
00:16:22,503 --> 00:16:29,217
 who had been with their flocks to water, stood

159
00:16:29,217 --> 00:16:35,931
 and scattered the flocks of Ammon and the servants

160
00:16:35,931 --> 00:16:42,645
 of the king, and they scattered them insomuch that

161
00:16:42,645 --> 00:16:49,359
 they fled many ways

162
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:56,141
28 Now the servants of the king began to murmur,

163
00:16:56,141 --> 00:17:03,141
 saying: Now the king will slay us, as he has our

164
00:17:03,141 --> 00:17:10,141
 brethren because their flocks were scattered by the

165
00:17:10,141 --> 00:17:17,141
 wickedness of these men. And they began to weep

166
00:17:17,141 --> 00:17:24,141
 exceedingly, saying: Behold, our flocks are

167
00:17:24,141 --> 00:17:31,141
 scattered already

168
00:17:31,15 --> 00:17:37,9
29 Now they wept because of the fear of being

169
00:17:37,9 --> 00:17:44,65
 slain. Now when Ammon saw this his heart was swollen

170
00:17:44,65 --> 00:17:51,4
 within him with joy; for, said he, I will show

171
00:17:51,4 --> 00:17:58,15
 forth my power unto these my fellow-servants, or the

172
00:17:58,15 --> 00:18:04,9
 power which is in me, in restoring these flocks

173
00:18:04,9 --> 00:18:11,65
 unto the king, that I may win the hearts of these my

174
00:18:11,65 --> 00:18:18,4
 fellow-servants, that I may lead them to believe

175
00:18:18,4 --> 00:18:25,15
 in my words

176
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:31,238
30 And now, these were the thoughts of Ammon, when

177
00:18:31,238 --> 00:18:36,905
 he saw the afflictions of those whom he termed to

178
00:18:36,905 --> 00:18:42,572
 be his brethren

179
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:48,154
31 And it came to pass that he flattered them by

180
00:18:48,154 --> 00:18:54,154
 his words, saying: My brethren, be of good cheer

181
00:18:54,154 --> 00:19:00,154
 and let us go in search of the flocks, and we will

182
00:19:00,154 --> 00:19:06,154
 gather them together and bring them back unto the

183
00:19:06,154 --> 00:19:12,154
 place of water; and thus we will preserve the

184
00:19:12,154 --> 00:19:18,154
 flocks unto the king and he will not slay us

185
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:23,157
32 And it came to pass that they went in search of

186
00:19:23,157 --> 00:19:28,157
 the flocks, and they did follow Ammon, and they

187
00:19:28,157 --> 00:19:33,157
 rushed forth with much swiftness and did head the

188
00:19:33,157 --> 00:19:38,157
 flocks of the king, and did gather them together

189
00:19:38,157 --> 00:19:43,157
 again to the place of water

190
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:49,615
33 And those men again stood to scatter their

191
00:19:49,615 --> 00:19:56,215
 flocks; but Ammon said unto his brethren: Encircle the

192
00:19:56,215 --> 00:20:02,815
 flocks round about that they flee not; and I go

193
00:20:02,815 --> 00:20:09,415
 and contend with these men who do scatter our

194
00:20:09,415 --> 00:20:16,015
 flocks

195
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:22,115
34 Therefore, they did as Ammon commanded them,

196
00:20:22,115 --> 00:20:28,115
 and he went forth and stood to contend with those

197
00:20:28,115 --> 00:20:34,115
 who stood by the waters of Sebus; and they were in

198
00:20:34,115 --> 00:20:40,115
 number not a few

199
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:46,672
35 Therefore they did not fear Ammon, for they

200
00:20:46,672 --> 00:20:53,005
 supposed that one of their men could slay him

201
00:20:53,005 --> 00:20:59,338
 according to their pleasure, for they knew not that the

202
00:20:59,338 --> 00:21:05,671
 Lord had promised Mosiah that he would deliver his

203
00:21:05,671 --> 00:21:12,004
 sons out of their hands; neither did they know

204
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:18,337
 anything concerning the Lord; therefore they

205
00:21:18,337 --> 00:21:24,67
 delighted in the destruction of their brethren; and for

206
00:21:24,67 --> 00:21:31,003
 this cause they stood to scatter the flocks of the

207
00:21:31,003 --> 00:21:37,336
 king

208
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:44,041
36 But Ammon stood forth and began to cast stones

209
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:50,819
 at them with his sling; yea, with mighty power he

210
00:21:50,819 --> 00:21:57,597
 did sling stones amongst them; and thus he slew a

211
00:21:57,597 --> 00:22:04,375
 certain number of them insomuch that they began to

212
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:11,153
 be astonished at his power; nevertheless they

213
00:22:11,153 --> 00:22:17,931
 were angry because of the slain of their brethren,

214
00:22:17,931 --> 00:22:24,709
 and they were determined that he should fall;

215
00:22:24,709 --> 00:22:31,487
 therefore, seeing that they could not hit him with their

216
00:22:31,487 --> 00:22:38,265
 stones, they came forth with clubs to slay him

217
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:45,407
37 But behold, every man that lifted his club to

218
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:52,157
 smite Ammon, he smote off their arms with his

219
00:22:52,157 --> 00:22:58,907
 sword; for he did withstand their blows by smiting

220
00:22:58,907 --> 00:23:05,657
 their arms with the edge of his sword, insomuch that

221
00:23:05,657 --> 00:23:12,407
 they began to be astonished, and began to flee

222
00:23:12,407 --> 00:23:19,157
 before him; yea, and they were not few in number; and

223
00:23:19,157 --> 00:23:25,907
 he caused them to flee by the strength of his arm

224
00:23:25,907 --> 00:23:32,657


225
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:40,511
38 Now six of them had fallen by the sling, but he

226
00:23:40,511 --> 00:23:48,511
 slew none save it were their leader with his

227
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:56,511
 sword; and he smote off as many of their arms as were

228
00:23:56,511 --> 00:24:04,511
 lifted against him, and they were not a few

229
00:24:04,41 --> 00:24:05,285
39 And when he had driven them afar off, he

230
00:24:05,285 --> 00:24:06,16
 returned and they watered their flocks and returned them

231
00:24:06,16 --> 00:24:07,035
 to the pasture of the king, and then went in unto

232
00:24:07,035 --> 00:24:07,91
 the king, bearing the arms which had been smitten

233
00:24:07,91 --> 00:24:08,785
 off by the sword of Ammon, of those who sought to

234
00:24:08,785 --> 00:24:09,66
 slay him; and they were carried in unto the king

235
00:24:09,66 --> 00:24:10,535
 for a testimony of the things which they had done.

236
00:24:10,535 --> 00:24:11,41
