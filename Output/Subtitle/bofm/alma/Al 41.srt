00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:02,5
Chapter 41 In the Resurrection men come forth to a

2
00:00:02,5 --> 00:00:05,0
 state of endless happiness or endless

3
00:00:05,0 --> 00:00:07,5
 misery—Wickedness never was happiness—Carnal men are without

4
00:00:07,5 --> 00:00:10,0
 God in the world—Every person receives again in

5
00:00:10,0 --> 00:00:12,5
 the Restoration the characteristics and attributes

6
00:00:12,5 --> 00:00:15,0
 acquired in mortality. About 74 B.C.

7
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:28,092
1 And now, my son, I have somewhat to say

8
00:00:28,092 --> 00:00:40,235
 concerning the restoration of which has been spoken; for

9
00:00:40,235 --> 00:00:52,378
 behold, some have wrested the scriptures, and have

10
00:00:52,378 --> 00:01:04,521
 gone far astray because of this thing. And I

11
00:01:04,521 --> 00:01:16,664
 perceive that thy mind has been worried also concerning

12
00:01:16,664 --> 00:01:28,807
 this thing. But behold, I will explain it unto

13
00:01:28,807 --> 00:01:40,95
 thee

14
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:46,734
2 I say unto thee, my son, that the plan of

15
00:01:46,734 --> 00:01:52,734
 restoration is requisite with the justice of God; for it

16
00:01:52,734 --> 00:01:58,734
 is requisite that all things should be restored

17
00:01:58,734 --> 00:02:04,734
 to their proper order. Behold, it is requisite and

18
00:02:04,734 --> 00:02:10,734
 just, according to the power and resurrection of

19
00:02:10,734 --> 00:02:16,734
 Christ, that the soul of man should be restored to

20
00:02:16,734 --> 00:02:22,734
 its body, and that every part of the body should

21
00:02:22,734 --> 00:02:28,734
 be restored to itself

22
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:34,082
3 And it is requisite with the justice of God that

23
00:02:34,082 --> 00:02:39,415
 men should be judged according to their works;

24
00:02:39,415 --> 00:02:44,748
 and if their works were good in this life, and the

25
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:50,081
 desires of their hearts were good, that they should

26
00:02:50,081 --> 00:02:55,414
 also, at the last day, be restored unto that

27
00:02:55,414 --> 00:03:00,747
 which is good

28
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:08,906
4 And if their works are evil they shall be

29
00:03:08,906 --> 00:03:17,031
 restored unto them for evil. Therefore, all things shall

30
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:25,156
 be restored to their proper order, every thing to

31
00:03:25,156 --> 00:03:33,281
 its natural frame—mortality raised to

32
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:41,406
 immortality, corruption to incorruption—raised to endless

33
00:03:41,406 --> 00:03:49,531
 happiness to inherit the kingdom of God, or to

34
00:03:49,531 --> 00:03:57,656
 endless misery to inherit the kingdom of the devil, the

35
00:03:57,656 --> 00:04:05,781
 one on one hand, the other on the other

36
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:12,712
5 The one raised to happiness according to his

37
00:04:12,712 --> 00:04:19,712
 desires of happiness, or good according to his

38
00:04:19,712 --> 00:04:26,712
 desires of good; and the other to evil according to his

39
00:04:26,712 --> 00:04:33,712
 desires of evil; for as he has desired to do evil

40
00:04:33,712 --> 00:04:40,712
 all the day long even so shall he have his reward

41
00:04:40,712 --> 00:04:47,712
 of evil when the night cometh

42
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:53,171
6 And so it is on the other hand. If he hath

43
00:04:53,171 --> 00:04:58,921
 repented of his sins, and desired righteousness until

44
00:04:58,921 --> 00:05:04,671
 the end of his days, even so he shall be rewarded

45
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:10,421
 unto righteousness

46
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:19,144
7 These are they that are redeemed of the Lord;

47
00:05:19,144 --> 00:05:27,544
 yea, these are they that are taken out, that are

48
00:05:27,544 --> 00:05:35,944
 delivered from that endless night of darkness; and

49
00:05:35,944 --> 00:05:44,344
 thus they stand or fall; for behold, they are their

50
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:52,744
 own judges, whether to do good or do evil

51
00:05:52,886 --> 00:06:00,219
8 Now, the decrees of God are unalterable;

52
00:06:00,219 --> 00:06:07,552
 therefore, the way is prepared that whosoever will may

53
00:06:07,552 --> 00:06:14,885
 walk therein and be saved

54
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:21,908
9 And now behold, my son, do not risk one more

55
00:06:21,908 --> 00:06:28,908
 offense against your God upon those points of

56
00:06:28,908 --> 00:06:35,908
 doctrine, which ye have hitherto risked to commit sin

57
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:41,278
10 Do not suppose, because it has been spoken

58
00:06:41,278 --> 00:06:47,528
 concerning restoration, that ye shall be restored from

59
00:06:47,528 --> 00:06:53,778
 sin to happiness. Behold, I say unto you,

60
00:06:53,778 --> 00:07:00,028
 wickedness never was happiness

61
00:07:00,42 --> 00:07:03,849
11 And now, my son, all men that are in a state of

62
00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:07,278
 nature, or I would say, in a carnal state, are in

63
00:07:07,278 --> 00:07:10,707
 the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of

64
00:07:10,707 --> 00:07:14,136
 iniquity; they are without God in the world, and they

65
00:07:14,136 --> 00:07:17,565
 have gone contrary to the nature of God; therefore,

66
00:07:17,565 --> 00:07:20,994
 they are in a state contrary to the nature of

67
00:07:20,994 --> 00:07:24,423
 happiness

68
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:35,844
12 And now behold, is the meaning of the word

69
00:07:35,844 --> 00:07:47,344
 restoration to take a thing of a natural state and

70
00:07:47,344 --> 00:07:58,844
 place it in an unnatural state, or to place it in a

71
00:07:58,844 --> 00:08:10,344
 state opposite to its nature

72
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:17,657
13 O, my son, this is not the case; but the

73
00:08:17,657 --> 00:08:24,99
 meaning of the word restoration is to bring back again

74
00:08:24,99 --> 00:08:32,323
 evil for evil, or carnal for carnal, or devilish

75
00:08:32,323 --> 00:08:39,656
 for devilish—good for that which is good; righteous

76
00:08:39,656 --> 00:08:46,989
 for that which is righteous; just for that which

77
00:08:46,989 --> 00:08:54,322
 is just; merciful for that which is merciful

78
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:59,951
14 Therefore, my son, see that you are merciful

79
00:08:59,951 --> 00:09:05,701
 unto your brethren; deal justly, judge righteously,

80
00:09:05,701 --> 00:09:11,451
 and do good continually; and if ye do all these

81
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:17,201
 things then shall ye receive your reward; yea, ye

82
00:09:17,201 --> 00:09:22,951
 shall have mercy restored unto you again; ye shall

83
00:09:22,951 --> 00:09:28,701
 have justice restored unto you again; ye shall have

84
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:34,451
 a righteous judgment restored unto you again; and

85
00:09:34,451 --> 00:09:40,201
 ye shall have good rewarded unto you again

86
00:09:40,848 --> 00:09:42,848
15 For that which ye do send out shall return unto

87
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:44,848
 you again, and be restored; therefore, the word

88
00:09:44,848 --> 00:09:46,848
 restoration more fully condemneth the sinner, and

89
00:09:46,848 --> 00:09:48,848
 justifieth him not at all.
