00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:49,167
Chapter 31 Alma heads a mission to reclaim the

2
00:00:49,167 --> 00:01:38,334
 apostate Zoramites—The Zoramites deny Christ, believe

3
00:01:38,334 --> 00:02:27,501
 in a false concept of election, and worship with

4
00:02:27,501 --> 00:03:16,668
 set prayers—The missionaries are filled with the

5
00:03:16,668 --> 00:04:05,835
 Holy Spirit—Their afflictions are swallowed up in

6
00:04:05,835 --> 00:04:55,002
 the joy of Christ. About 74 B.C.

7
00:04:55,061 --> 00:05:04,061
1 Now it came to pass that after the end of

8
00:05:04,061 --> 00:05:13,061
 Korihor, Alma having received tidings that the Zoramites

9
00:05:13,061 --> 00:05:22,061
 were perverting the ways of the Lord, and that

10
00:05:22,061 --> 00:05:31,061
 Zoram, who was their leader, was leading the hearts

11
00:05:31,061 --> 00:05:40,061
 of the people to bow down to dumb idols, his heart

12
00:05:40,061 --> 00:05:49,061
 again began to sicken because of the iniquity of

13
00:05:49,061 --> 00:05:58,061
 the people

14
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:06,858
2 For it was the cause of great sorrow to Alma to

15
00:06:06,858 --> 00:06:14,858
 know of iniquity among his people; therefore his

16
00:06:14,858 --> 00:06:22,858
 heart was exceedingly sorrowful because of the

17
00:06:22,858 --> 00:06:30,858
 separation of the Zoramites from the Nephites

18
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:35,328
3 Now the Zoramites had gathered themselves

19
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:39,899
 together in a land which they called Antionum, which was

20
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:44,47
 east of the land of Zarahemla, which lay nearly

21
00:06:44,47 --> 00:06:49,041
 bordering upon the seashore, which was south of the

22
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:53,612
 land of Jershon, which also bordered upon the

23
00:06:53,612 --> 00:06:58,183
 wilderness south, which wilderness was full of the

24
00:06:58,183 --> 00:07:02,754
 Lamanites

25
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:14,656
4 Now the Nephites greatly feared that the

26
00:07:14,656 --> 00:07:26,656
 Zoramites would enter into a correspondence with the

27
00:07:26,656 --> 00:07:38,656
 Lamanites, and that it would be the means of great

28
00:07:38,656 --> 00:07:50,656
 loss on the part of the Nephites

29
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:55,074
5 And now, as the preaching of the word had a

30
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:59,645
 great tendency to lead the people to do that which was

31
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:04,216
 just—yea, it had had more powerful effect upon

32
00:08:04,216 --> 00:08:08,787
 the minds of the people than the sword, or anything

33
00:08:08,787 --> 00:08:13,358
 else, which had happened unto them—therefore Alma

34
00:08:13,358 --> 00:08:17,929
 thought it was expedient that they should try the

35
00:08:17,929 --> 00:08:22,5
 virtue of the word of God

36
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:43,202
6 Therefore he took Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner;

37
00:08:43,202 --> 00:09:04,002
 and Himni he did leave in the church in Zarahemla;

38
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:24,802
 but the former three he took with him, and also

39
00:09:24,802 --> 00:09:45,602
 Amulek and Zeezrom, who were at Melek; and he also

40
00:09:45,602 --> 00:10:06,402
 took two of his sons

41
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:07,405
7 Now the eldest of his sons he took not with him,

42
00:10:07,405 --> 00:10:08,738
 and his name was Helaman; but the names of those

43
00:10:08,738 --> 00:10:10,071
 whom he took with him were Shiblon and Corianton;

44
00:10:10,071 --> 00:10:11,404
 and these are the names of those who went with him

45
00:10:11,404 --> 00:10:12,737
 among the Zoramites, to preach unto them the

46
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,07
 word

47
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:40,38
8 Now the Zoramites were dissenters from the

48
00:10:40,38 --> 00:11:06,713
 Nephites; therefore they had had the word of God

49
00:11:06,713 --> 00:11:33,046
 preached unto them

50
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:47,126
9 But they had fallen into great errors, for they

51
00:11:47,126 --> 00:12:00,459
 would not observe to keep the commandments of God,

52
00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:13,792
 and his statutes, according to the law of Moses

53
00:12:13,666 --> 00:13:15,416
10 Neither would they observe the performances of

54
00:13:15,416 --> 00:14:17,166
 the church, to continue in prayer and supplication

55
00:14:17,166 --> 00:15:18,916
 to God daily, that they might not enter into

56
00:15:18,916 --> 00:16:20,666
 temptation

57
00:16:20,88 --> 00:16:48,88
11 Yea, in fine, they did pervert the ways of the

58
00:16:48,88 --> 00:17:16,88
 Lord in very many instances; therefore, for this

59
00:17:16,88 --> 00:17:44,88
 cause, Alma and his brethren went into the land to

60
00:17:44,88 --> 00:18:12,88
 preach the word unto them

61
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:19,382
12 Now, when they had come into the land, behold,

62
00:18:19,382 --> 00:18:26,239
 to their astonishment they found that the

63
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:33,096
 Zoramites had built synagogues, and that they did gather

64
00:18:33,096 --> 00:18:39,953
 themselves together on one day of the week, which

65
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:46,81
 day they did call the day of the Lord; and they did

66
00:18:46,81 --> 00:18:53,667
 worship after a manner which Alma and his

67
00:18:53,667 --> 00:19:00,524
 brethren had never beheld

68
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:04,373
13 For they had a place built up in the center of

69
00:19:04,373 --> 00:19:08,373
 their synagogue, a place for standing, which was

70
00:19:08,373 --> 00:19:12,373
 high above the head; and the top thereof would only

71
00:19:12,373 --> 00:19:16,373
 admit one person

72
00:04:55,061 --> 00:05:04,061
16 Holy God, we believe that thou hast separated

73
00:05:04,061 --> 00:05:13,061
 us from our brethren; and we do not believe in the

74
00:05:13,061 --> 00:05:22,061
 tradition of our brethren, which was handed down

75
00:05:22,061 --> 00:05:31,061
 to them by the childishness of their fathers; but

76
00:05:31,061 --> 00:05:40,061
 we believe that thou hast elected us to be thy holy

77
00:05:40,061 --> 00:05:49,061
 children; and also thou hast made it known unto

78
00:05:49,061 --> 00:05:58,061
 us that there shall be no Christ

79
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:02,058
17 But thou art the same yesterday, today, and

80
00:06:02,058 --> 00:06:05,258
 forever; and thou hast elected us that we shall be

81
00:06:05,258 --> 00:06:08,459
 saved, whilst all around us are elected to be cast

82
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:11,659
 by thy wrath down to hell; for the which holiness,

83
00:06:11,659 --> 00:06:14,858
 O God, we thank thee; and we also thank thee that

84
00:06:14,858 --> 00:06:18,058
 thou hast elected us, that we may not be led away

85
00:06:18,058 --> 00:06:21,258
 after the foolish traditions of our brethren,

86
00:06:21,258 --> 00:06:24,459
 which doth bind them down to a belief of Christ, which

87
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:27,659
 doth lead their hearts to wander far from thee,

88
00:06:27,659 --> 00:06:30,858
 our God

89
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:46,757
18 And again we thank thee, O God, that we are a

90
00:06:46,757 --> 00:07:02,757
 chosen and a holy people. Amen

91
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:18,656
19 Now it came to pass that after Alma and his

92
00:07:18,656 --> 00:07:34,656
 brethren and his sons had heard these prayers, they

93
00:07:34,656 --> 00:07:50,656
 were astonished beyond all measure

94
00:07:50,503 --> 00:08:06,503
20 For behold, every man did go forth and offer up

95
00:08:06,503 --> 00:08:22,503
 these same prayers

96
00:08:22,402 --> 00:09:14,402
21 Now the place was called by them Rameumptom,

97
00:09:14,402 --> 00:10:06,402
 which, being interpreted, is the holy stand

98
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:07,215
22 Now, from this stand they did offer up, every

99
00:10:07,215 --> 00:10:08,358
 man, the selfsame prayer unto God, thanking their

100
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:09,501
 God that they were chosen of him, and that he did

101
00:10:09,501 --> 00:10:10,644
 not lead them away after the tradition of their

102
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:11,787
 brethren, and that their hearts were not stolen away

103
00:10:11,787 --> 00:10:12,93
 to believe in things to come, which they knew

104
00:10:12,93 --> 00:10:14,073
 nothing about

105
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:29,847
23 Now, after the people had all offered up thanks

106
00:10:29,847 --> 00:10:45,647
 after this manner, they returned to their homes,

107
00:10:45,647 --> 00:11:01,447
 never speaking of their God again until they had

108
00:11:01,447 --> 00:11:17,247
 assembled themselves together again to the holy

109
00:11:17,247 --> 00:11:33,047
 stand, to offer up thanks after their manner

110
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:41,793
24 Now when Alma saw this his heart was grieved;

111
00:11:41,793 --> 00:11:49,793
 for he saw that they were a wicked and a perverse

112
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:57,793
 people; yea, he saw that their hearts were set upon

113
00:11:57,793 --> 00:12:05,793
 gold, and upon silver, and upon all manner of

114
00:12:05,793 --> 00:12:13,793
 fine goods

115
00:12:13,666 --> 00:14:17,166
25 Yea, and he also saw that their hearts were

116
00:14:17,166 --> 00:16:20,666
 lifted up unto great boasting, in their pride

117
00:16:20,88 --> 00:16:43,28
26 And he lifted up his voice to heaven, and

118
00:16:43,28 --> 00:17:05,68
 cried, saying: O, how long, O Lord, wilt thou suffer

119
00:17:05,68 --> 00:17:28,08
 that thy servants shall dwell here below in the

120
00:17:28,08 --> 00:17:50,48
 flesh, to behold such gross wickedness among the

121
00:17:50,48 --> 00:18:12,88
 children of men

122
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:22,125
27 Behold, O God, they cry unto thee, and yet

123
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:31,725
 their hearts are swallowed up in their pride. Behold,

124
00:18:31,725 --> 00:18:41,325
 O God, they cry unto thee with their mouths, while

125
00:18:41,325 --> 00:18:50,925
 they are puffed up, even to greatness, with the

126
00:18:50,925 --> 00:19:00,525
 vain things of the world

127
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:02,659
28 Behold, O my God, their costly apparel, and

128
00:19:02,659 --> 00:19:04,945
 their ringlets, and their bracelets, and their

129
00:19:04,945 --> 00:19:07,231
 ornaments of gold, and all their precious things which

130
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:09,517
 they are ornamented with; and behold, their hearts

131
00:19:09,517 --> 00:19:11,803
 are set upon them, and yet they cry unto thee and

132
00:19:11,803 --> 00:19:14,089
 say—We thank thee, O God, for we are a chosen

133
00:19:14,089 --> 00:19:16,375
 people unto thee, while others shall perish

134
00:04:55,061 --> 00:05:05,561
31 O Lord, my heart is exceedingly sorrowful; wilt

135
00:05:05,561 --> 00:05:16,061
 thou comfort my soul in Christ. O Lord, wilt thou

136
00:05:16,061 --> 00:05:26,561
 grant unto me that I may have strength, that I

137
00:05:26,561 --> 00:05:37,061
 may suffer with patience these afflictions which

138
00:05:37,061 --> 00:05:47,561
 shall come upon me, because of the iniquity of this

139
00:05:47,561 --> 00:05:58,061
 people

140
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:04,192
32 O Lord, wilt thou comfort my soul, and give

141
00:06:04,192 --> 00:06:09,524
 unto me success, and also my fellow laborers who are

142
00:06:09,524 --> 00:06:14,858
 with me—yea, Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner, and also

143
00:06:14,858 --> 00:06:20,19
 Amulek and Zeezrom, and also my two sons—yea,

144
00:06:20,19 --> 00:06:25,524
 even all these wilt thou comfort, O Lord. Yea, wilt

145
00:06:25,524 --> 00:06:30,856
 thou comfort their souls in Christ

146
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:38,757
33 Wilt thou grant unto them that they may have

147
00:06:38,757 --> 00:06:46,757
 strength, that they may bear their afflictions which

148
00:06:46,757 --> 00:06:54,757
 shall come upon them because of the iniquities of

149
00:06:54,757 --> 00:07:02,757
 this people

150
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:18,656
34 O Lord, wilt thou grant unto us that we may

151
00:07:18,656 --> 00:07:34,656
 have success in bringing them again unto thee in

152
00:07:34,656 --> 00:07:50,656
 Christ

153
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:58,503
35 Behold, O Lord, their souls are precious, and

154
00:07:58,503 --> 00:08:06,503
 many of them are our brethren; therefore, give unto

155
00:08:06,503 --> 00:08:14,503
 us, O Lord, power and wisdom that we may bring

156
00:08:14,503 --> 00:08:22,503
 these, our brethren, again unto thee

157
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:43,202
36 Now it came to pass that when Alma had said

158
00:08:43,202 --> 00:09:04,002
 these words, that he clapped his hands upon all them

159
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:24,802
 who were with him. And behold, as he clapped his

160
00:09:24,802 --> 00:09:45,602
 hands upon them, they were filled with the Holy

161
00:09:45,602 --> 00:10:06,402
 Spirit

162
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,072
37 And after that they did separate themselves one

163
00:10:08,072 --> 00:10:10,072
 from another, taking no thought for themselves

164
00:10:10,072 --> 00:10:12,072
 what they should eat, or what they should drink, or

165
00:10:12,072 --> 00:10:14,072
 what they should put on

166
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:14,047
38 And the Lord provided for them that they should

167
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:14,047
 hunger not, neither should they thirst; yea, and

168
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:14,047
 he also gave them strength, that they should

169
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:14,047
 suffer no manner of afflictions, save it were swallowed

170
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:14,047
 up in the joy of Christ. Now this was according

171
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:14,047
 to the prayer of Alma; and this because he prayed

172
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:14,047
 in faith.
