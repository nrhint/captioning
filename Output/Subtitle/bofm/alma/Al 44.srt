00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:03,75
Chapter 44 Moroni commands the Lamanites to make a

2
00:00:03,75 --> 00:00:07,5
 covenant of peace or be destroyed—Zerahemnah

3
00:00:07,5 --> 00:00:11,25
 rejects the offer, and the battle resumes—Moroni’s

4
00:00:11,25 --> 00:00:15,0
 armies defeat the Lamanites. About 74–73 B.C.

5
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:36,749
1 And it came to pass that they did stop and

6
00:00:36,749 --> 00:00:57,549
 withdrew a pace from them. And Moroni said unto

7
00:00:57,549 --> 00:01:18,349
 Zerahemnah: Behold, Zerahemnah, that we do not desire to

8
00:01:18,349 --> 00:01:39,149
 be men of blood. Ye know that ye are in our hands,

9
00:01:39,149 --> 00:01:59,949
 yet we do not desire to slay you

10
00:01:59,62 --> 00:01:59,953
2 Behold, we have not come out to battle against

11
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:00,285
 you that we might shed your blood for power;

12
00:02:00,285 --> 00:02:00,618
 neither do we desire to bring any one to the yoke of

13
00:02:00,618 --> 00:02:00,951
 bondage. But this is the very cause for which ye have

14
00:02:00,951 --> 00:02:01,285
 come against us; yea, and ye are angry with us

15
00:02:01,285 --> 00:02:01,618
 because of our religion

16
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:06,822
3 But now, ye behold that the Lord is with us; and

17
00:02:06,822 --> 00:02:11,989
 ye behold that he has delivered you into our

18
00:02:11,989 --> 00:02:17,156
 hands. And now I would that ye should understand that

19
00:02:17,156 --> 00:02:22,323
 this is done unto us because of our religion and

20
00:02:22,323 --> 00:02:27,49
 our faith in Christ. And now ye see that ye cannot

21
00:02:27,49 --> 00:02:32,657
 destroy this our faith

22
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:39,71
4 Now ye see that this is the true faith of God;

23
00:02:39,71 --> 00:02:46,567
 yea, ye see that God will support, and keep, and

24
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:53,424
 preserve us, so long as we are faithful unto him,

25
00:02:53,424 --> 00:03:00,281
 and unto our faith, and our religion; and never will

26
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:07,138
 the Lord suffer that we shall be destroyed except

27
00:03:07,138 --> 00:03:13,995
 we should fall into transgression and deny our

28
00:03:13,995 --> 00:03:20,852
 faith

29
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:29,667
5 And now, Zerahemnah, I command you, in the name

30
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:39,167
 of that all-powerful God, who has strengthened our

31
00:03:39,167 --> 00:03:48,667
 arms that we have gained power over you, by our

32
00:03:48,667 --> 00:03:58,167
 faith, by our religion, and by our rites of

33
00:03:58,167 --> 00:04:07,667
 worship, and by our church, and by the sacred support

34
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:17,167
 which we owe to our wives and our children, by that

35
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:26,667
 liberty which binds us to our lands and our

36
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:36,167
 country; yea, and also by the maintenance of the sacred

37
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:45,667
 word of God, to which we owe all our happiness; and

38
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:55,167
 by all that is most dear unto us

39
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:57,662
6 Yea, and this is not all; I command you by all

40
00:04:57,662 --> 00:05:00,162
 the desires which ye have for life, that ye deliver

41
00:05:00,162 --> 00:05:02,662
 up your weapons of war unto us, and we will seek

42
00:05:02,662 --> 00:05:05,162
 not your blood, but we will spare your lives, if

43
00:05:05,162 --> 00:05:07,662
 ye will go your way and come not again to war

44
00:05:07,662 --> 00:05:10,162
 against us

45
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:19,306
7 And now, if ye do not this, behold, ye are in

46
00:05:19,306 --> 00:05:27,735
 our hands, and I will command my men that they shall

47
00:05:27,735 --> 00:05:36,164
 fall upon you, and inflict the wounds of death in

48
00:05:36,164 --> 00:05:44,593
 your bodies, that ye may become extinct; and then

49
00:05:44,593 --> 00:05:53,022
 we will see who shall have power over this

50
00:05:53,022 --> 00:06:01,451
 people; yea, we will see who shall be brought into

51
00:06:01,451 --> 00:06:09,88
 bondage

52
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:12,678
8 And now it came to pass that when Zerahemnah had

53
00:06:12,678 --> 00:06:15,587
 heard these sayings he came forth and delivered

54
00:06:15,587 --> 00:06:18,496
 up his sword and his cimeter, and his bow into the

55
00:06:18,496 --> 00:06:21,405
 hands of Moroni, and said unto him: Behold, here

56
00:06:21,405 --> 00:06:24,314
 are our weapons of war; we will deliver them up

57
00:06:24,314 --> 00:06:27,223
 unto you, but we will not suffer ourselves to take an

58
00:06:27,223 --> 00:06:30,132
 oath unto you, which we know that we shall break,

59
00:06:30,132 --> 00:06:33,041
 and also our children; but take our weapons of

60
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:35,95
 war, and suffer that we may depart into the

61
00:06:35,95 --> 00:06:38,859
 wilderness; otherwise we will retain our swords, and we

62
00:06:38,859 --> 00:06:41,768
 will perish or conquer

63
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:53,668
9 Behold, we are not of your faith; we do not

64
00:06:53,668 --> 00:07:05,668
 believe that it is God that has delivered us into your

65
00:07:05,668 --> 00:07:17,668
 hands; but we believe that it is your cunning

66
00:07:17,668 --> 00:07:29,668
 that has preserved you from our swords. Behold, it is

67
00:07:29,668 --> 00:07:41,668
 your breastplates and your shields that have

68
00:07:41,668 --> 00:07:53,668
 preserved you

69
00:07:53,44 --> 00:08:05,44
10 And now when Zerahemnah had made an end of

70
00:08:05,44 --> 00:08:17,44
 speaking these words, Moroni returned the sword and

71
00:08:17,44 --> 00:08:29,44
 the weapons of war, which he had received, unto

72
00:08:29,44 --> 00:08:41,44
 Zerahemnah, saying: Behold, we will end the conflict

73
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:45,287
11 Now I cannot recall the words which I have

74
00:08:45,287 --> 00:08:49,287
 spoken, therefore as the Lord liveth, ye shall not

75
00:08:49,287 --> 00:08:53,287
 depart except ye depart with an oath that ye will not

76
00:08:53,287 --> 00:08:57,287
 return again against us to war. Now as ye are in

77
00:08:57,287 --> 00:09:01,287
 our hands we will spill your blood upon the

78
00:09:01,287 --> 00:09:05,287
 ground, or ye shall submit to the conditions which I

79
00:09:05,287 --> 00:09:09,287
 have proposed

80
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:19,982
12 And now when Moroni had said these words,

81
00:09:19,982 --> 00:09:30,649
 Zerahemnah retained his sword, and he was angry with

82
00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:41,316
 Moroni, and he rushed forward that he might slay

83
00:09:41,316 --> 00:09:51,983
 Moroni; but as he raised his sword, behold, one of

84
00:09:51,983 --> 00:10:02,65
 Moroni’s soldiers smote it even to the earth, and it

85
00:10:02,65 --> 00:10:13,317
 broke by the hilt; and he also smote Zerahemnah

86
00:10:13,317 --> 00:10:23,984
 that he took off his scalp and it fell to the

87
00:10:23,984 --> 00:10:34,651
 earth. And Zerahemnah withdrew from before them into

88
00:10:34,651 --> 00:10:45,318
 the midst of his soldiers

89
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:55,511
13 And it came to pass that the soldier who stood

90
00:10:55,511 --> 00:11:06,011
 by, who smote off the scalp of Zerahemnah, took up

91
00:11:06,011 --> 00:11:16,511
 the scalp from off the ground by the hair, and

92
00:11:16,511 --> 00:11:27,011
 laid it upon the point of his sword, and stretched

93
00:11:27,011 --> 00:11:37,511
 it forth unto them, saying unto them with a loud

94
00:11:37,511 --> 00:11:48,011
 voice

95
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:50,808
14 Even as this scalp has fallen to the earth,

96
00:11:50,808 --> 00:11:52,808
 which is the scalp of your chief, so shall ye fall to

97
00:11:52,808 --> 00:11:54,808
 the earth except ye will deliver up your weapons

98
00:11:54,808 --> 00:11:56,808
 of war and depart with a covenant of peace

99
00:11:56,783 --> 00:12:00,212
15 Now there were many, when they heard these

100
00:12:00,212 --> 00:12:03,641
 words and saw the scalp which was upon the sword, that

101
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:07,07
 were struck with fear; and many came forth and

102
00:12:07,07 --> 00:12:10,499
 threw down their weapons of war at the feet of

103
00:12:10,499 --> 00:12:13,928
 Moroni, and entered into a covenant of peace. And as

104
00:12:13,928 --> 00:12:17,357
 many as entered into a covenant they suffered to

105
00:12:17,357 --> 00:12:20,786
 depart into the wilderness

106
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:36,707
16 Now it came to pass that Zerahemnah was

107
00:12:36,707 --> 00:12:52,707
 exceedingly wroth, and he did stir up the remainder of

108
00:12:52,707 --> 00:13:08,707
 his soldiers to anger, to contend more powerfully

109
00:13:08,707 --> 00:13:24,707
 against the Nephites

110
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:28,504
17 And now Moroni was angry, because of the

111
00:13:28,504 --> 00:13:32,504
 stubbornness of the Lamanites; therefore he commanded

112
00:13:32,504 --> 00:13:36,504
 his people that they should fall upon them and slay

113
00:13:36,504 --> 00:13:40,504
 them. And it came to pass that they began to slay

114
00:13:40,504 --> 00:13:44,504
 them; yea, and the Lamanites did contend with

115
00:13:44,504 --> 00:13:48,504
 their swords and their might

116
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:49,761
18 But behold, their naked skins and their bare

117
00:13:49,761 --> 00:13:51,094
 heads were exposed to the sharp swords of the

118
00:13:51,094 --> 00:13:52,427
 Nephites; yea, behold they were pierced and smitten,

119
00:13:52,427 --> 00:13:53,76
 yea, and did fall exceedingly fast before the swords

120
00:13:53,76 --> 00:13:55,093
 of the Nephites; and they began to be swept down,

121
00:13:55,093 --> 00:13:56,426
 even as the soldier of Moroni had prophesied

122
00:13:56,402 --> 00:14:01,735
19 Now Zerahemnah, when he saw that they were all

123
00:14:01,735 --> 00:14:07,068
 about to be destroyed, cried mightily unto Moroni,

124
00:14:07,068 --> 00:14:12,401
 promising that he would covenant and also his

125
00:14:12,401 --> 00:14:17,734
 people with them, if they would spare the remainder

126
00:14:17,734 --> 00:14:23,067
 of their lives, that they never would come to war

127
00:14:23,067 --> 00:14:28,4
 again against them

128
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:50,616
22 And it came to pass that they did cast their

129
00:00:50,616 --> 00:01:25,283
 dead into the waters of Sidon, and they have gone

130
00:01:25,283 --> 00:01:59,95
 forth and are buried in the depths of the sea

131
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:11,62
23 And the armies of the Nephites, or of Moroni,

132
00:02:11,62 --> 00:02:23,62
 returned and came to their houses and their lands

133
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:23,793
24 And thus ended the eighteenth year of the reign

134
00:02:23,793 --> 00:02:24,043
 of the judges over the people of Nephi. And thus

135
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:24,293
 ended the record of Alma, which was written upon

136
00:02:24,293 --> 00:02:24,543
 the plates of Nephi.
