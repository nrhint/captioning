1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:28,875
Chapter 43 Alma and his sons preach the word—The

2
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:57,75
 Zoramites and other Nephite dissenters become

3
00:00:57,75 --> 00:01:26,625
 Lamanites—The Lamanites come against the Nephites in

4
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:55,5
 war—Moroni arms the Nephites with defensive

5
00:01:55,5 --> 00:02:24,375
 armor—The Lord reveals to Alma the strategy of the

6
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:53,25
 Lamanites—The Nephites defend their homes, liberties,

7
00:02:53,25 --> 00:03:22,125
 families, and religion—The armies of Moroni and Lehi

8
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:51,0
 surround the Lamanites. About 74 B.C.

9
00:03:51,264 --> 00:04:21,014
1 And now it came to pass that the sons of Alma

10
00:04:21,014 --> 00:04:50,764
 did go forth among the people, to declare the word

11
00:04:50,764 --> 00:05:20,514
 unto them. And Alma, also, himself, could not rest,

12
00:05:20,514 --> 00:05:50,264
 and he also went forth

13
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:58,884
2 Now we shall say no more concerning their

14
00:05:58,884 --> 00:06:06,884
 preaching, except that they preached the word, and the

15
00:06:06,884 --> 00:06:14,884
 truth, according to the spirit of prophecy and

16
00:06:14,884 --> 00:06:22,884
 revelation; and they preached after the holy order of

17
00:06:22,884 --> 00:06:30,884
 God by which they were called

18
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:33,424
3 And now I return to an account of the wars

19
00:06:33,424 --> 00:06:36,091
 between the Nephites and the Lamanites, in the

20
00:06:36,091 --> 00:06:38,758
 eighteenth year of the reign of the judges

21
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:42,161
4 For behold, it came to pass that the Zoramites

22
00:06:42,161 --> 00:06:45,59
 became Lamanites; therefore, in the commencement of

23
00:06:45,59 --> 00:06:49,019
 the eighteenth year the people of the Nephites

24
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:52,448
 saw that the Lamanites were coming upon them;

25
00:06:52,448 --> 00:06:55,877
 therefore they made preparations for war; yea, they

26
00:06:55,877 --> 00:06:59,306
 gathered together their armies in the land of Jershon

27
00:06:59,306 --> 00:07:02,735


28
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:18,656
5 And it came to pass that the Lamanites came with

29
00:07:18,656 --> 00:07:34,656
 their thousands; and they came into the land of

30
00:07:34,656 --> 00:07:50,656
 Antionum, which is the land of the Zoramites; and a

31
00:07:50,656 --> 00:08:06,656
 man by the name of Zerahemnah was their leader

32
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:25,653
6 And now, as the Amalekites were of a more wicked

33
00:08:25,653 --> 00:08:44,853
 and murderous disposition than the Lamanites

34
00:08:44,853 --> 00:09:04,053
 were, in and of themselves, therefore, Zerahemnah

35
00:09:04,053 --> 00:09:23,253
 appointed chief captains over the Lamanites, and they

36
00:09:23,253 --> 00:09:42,453
 were all Amalekites and Zoramites

37
00:09:42,148 --> 00:10:09,898
7 Now this he did that he might preserve their

38
00:10:09,898 --> 00:10:37,648
 hatred towards the Nephites, that he might bring them

39
00:10:37,648 --> 00:11:05,398
 into subjection to the accomplishment of his

40
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:33,148
 designs

41
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,393
8 For behold, his designs were to stir up the

42
00:11:35,393 --> 00:11:36,993
 Lamanites to anger against the Nephites; this he did

43
00:11:36,993 --> 00:11:38,593
 that he might usurp great power over them, and also

44
00:11:38,593 --> 00:11:40,193
 that he might gain power over the Nephites by

45
00:11:40,193 --> 00:11:41,793
 bringing them into bondage

46
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:48,625
9 And now the design of the Nephites was to

47
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:55,482
 support their lands, and their houses, and their wives,

48
00:11:55,482 --> 00:12:02,339
 and their children, that they might preserve them

49
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:09,196
 from the hands of their enemies; and also that

50
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:16,053
 they might preserve their rights and their

51
00:12:16,053 --> 00:12:22,91
 privileges, yea, and also their liberty, that they might

52
00:12:22,91 --> 00:12:29,767
 worship God according to their desires

53
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:47,616
10 For they knew that if they should fall into the

54
00:12:47,616 --> 00:13:05,616
 hands of the Lamanites, that whosoever should

55
00:13:05,616 --> 00:13:23,616
 worship God in spirit and in truth, the true and the

56
00:13:23,616 --> 00:13:41,616
 living God, the Lamanites would destroy

57
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:50,53
11 Yea, and they also knew the extreme hatred of

58
00:13:50,53 --> 00:13:59,673
 the Lamanites towards their brethren, who were the

59
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:08,816
 people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi, who were called the

60
00:14:08,816 --> 00:14:17,959
 people of Ammon—and they would not take up arms, yea,

61
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:27,102
 they had entered into a covenant and they would

62
00:14:27,102 --> 00:14:36,245
 not break it—therefore, if they should fall into

63
00:14:36,245 --> 00:14:45,388
 the hands of the Lamanites they would be destroyed

64
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:50,517
12 And the Nephites would not suffer that they

65
00:14:50,517 --> 00:14:55,85
 should be destroyed; therefore they gave them lands

66
00:14:55,85 --> 00:15:01,183
 for their inheritance

67
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:07,009
13 And the people of Ammon did give unto the

68
00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:12,884
 Nephites a large portion of their substance to support

69
00:15:12,884 --> 00:15:18,759
 their armies; and thus the Nephites were

70
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:24,634
 compelled, alone, to withstand against the Lamanites, who

71
00:15:24,634 --> 00:15:30,509
 were a compound of Laman and Lemuel, and the sons

72
00:15:30,509 --> 00:15:36,384
 of Ishmael, and all those who had dissented from

73
00:15:36,384 --> 00:15:42,259
 the Nephites, who were Amalekites and Zoramites, and

74
00:15:42,259 --> 00:15:48,134
 the descendants of the priests of Noah

75
00:15:48,981 --> 00:16:16,981
14 Now those descendants were as numerous, nearly,

76
00:16:16,981 --> 00:16:44,981
 as were the Nephites; and thus the Nephites were

77
00:16:44,981 --> 00:17:12,981
 obliged to contend with their brethren, even unto

78
00:17:12,981 --> 00:17:40,981
 bloodshed

79
00:17:40,626 --> 00:18:12,626
15 And it came to pass as the armies of the

80
00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:44,626
 Lamanites had gathered together in the land of Antionum,

81
00:18:44,626 --> 00:19:16,626
 behold, the armies of the Nephites were prepared

82
00:19:16,626 --> 00:19:48,626
 to meet them in the land of Jershon

83
00:19:48,22 --> 00:19:49,82
16 Now, the leader of the Nephites, or the man who

84
00:19:49,82 --> 00:19:51,42
 had been appointed to be the chief captain over

85
00:19:51,42 --> 00:19:53,02
 the Nephites—now the chief captain took the command

86
00:19:53,02 --> 00:19:54,62
 of all the armies of the Nephites—and his name

87
00:19:54,62 --> 00:19:56,22
 was Moroni

88
00:19:56,195 --> 00:20:21,945
17 And Moroni took all the command, and the

89
00:20:21,945 --> 00:20:47,695
 government of their wars. And he was only twenty and

90
00:20:47,695 --> 00:21:13,445
 five years old when he was appointed chief captain

91
00:21:13,445 --> 00:21:39,195
 over the armies of the Nephites

92
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:43,865
18 And it came to pass that he met the Lamanites

93
00:21:43,865 --> 00:21:47,865
 in the borders of Jershon, and his people were

94
00:21:47,865 --> 00:21:51,865
 armed with swords, and with cimeters, and all manner

95
00:21:51,865 --> 00:21:55,865
 of weapons of war

96
00:21:55,814 --> 00:22:08,614
19 And when the armies of the Lamanites saw that

97
00:22:08,614 --> 00:22:21,414
 the people of Nephi, or that Moroni, had prepared

98
00:22:21,414 --> 00:22:34,215
 his people with breastplates and with arm-shields,

99
00:22:34,215 --> 00:22:47,014
 yea, and also shields to defend their heads, and

100
00:22:47,014 --> 00:22:59,814
 also they were dressed with thick clothing

101
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:16,755
20 Now the army of Zerahemnah was not prepared

102
00:23:16,755 --> 00:23:33,898
 with any such thing; they had only their swords and

103
00:23:33,898 --> 00:23:51,041
 their cimeters, their bows and their arrows, their

104
00:23:51,041 --> 00:24:08,184
 stones and their slings; and they were naked, save

105
00:24:08,184 --> 00:24:25,327
 it were a skin which was girded about their

106
00:24:25,327 --> 00:24:42,47
 loins; yea, all were naked, save it were the Zoramites

107
00:24:42,47 --> 00:24:59,613
 and the Amalekites

108
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:13,631
21 But they were not armed with breastplates, nor

109
00:25:13,631 --> 00:25:28,031
 shields—therefore, they were exceedingly afraid of

110
00:25:28,031 --> 00:25:42,431
 the armies of the Nephites because of their

111
00:25:42,431 --> 00:25:56,831
 armor, notwithstanding their number being so much

112
00:25:56,831 --> 00:26:11,231
 greater than the Nephites

113
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:13,559
22 Behold, now it came to pass that they durst not

114
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:16,115
 come against the Nephites in the borders of

115
00:26:16,115 --> 00:26:18,671
 Jershon; therefore they departed out of the land of

116
00:26:18,671 --> 00:26:21,227
 Antionum into the wilderness, and took their journey

117
00:26:21,227 --> 00:26:23,783
 round about in the wilderness, away by the head of

118
00:26:23,783 --> 00:26:26,339
 the river Sidon, that they might come into the

119
00:26:26,339 --> 00:26:28,895
 land of Manti and take possession of the land; for

120
00:26:28,895 --> 00:26:31,451
 they did not suppose that the armies of Moroni

121
00:26:31,451 --> 00:26:34,007
 would know whither they had gone

122
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:44,07
23 But it came to pass, as soon as they had

123
00:26:44,07 --> 00:26:53,213
 departed into the wilderness Moroni sent spies into the

124
00:26:53,213 --> 00:27:02,356
 wilderness to watch their camp; and Moroni, also,

125
00:27:02,356 --> 00:27:11,499
 knowing of the prophecies of Alma, sent certain

126
00:27:11,499 --> 00:27:20,642
 men unto him, desiring him that he should inquire of

127
00:27:20,642 --> 00:27:29,785
 the Lord whither the armies of the Nephites

128
00:27:29,785 --> 00:27:38,928
 should go to defend themselves against the Lamanites

129
00:27:38,724 --> 00:27:42,724
24 And it came to pass that the word of the Lord

130
00:27:42,724 --> 00:27:46,724
 came unto Alma, and Alma informed the messengers of

131
00:27:46,724 --> 00:27:50,724
 Moroni, that the armies of the Lamanites were

132
00:27:50,724 --> 00:27:54,724
 marching round about in the wilderness, that they

133
00:27:54,724 --> 00:27:58,724
 might come over into the land of Manti, that they

134
00:27:58,724 --> 00:28:02,724
 might commence an attack upon the weaker part of the

135
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:06,724
 people. And those messengers went and delivered

136
00:28:06,724 --> 00:28:10,724
 the message unto Moroni

137
00:03:51,264 --> 00:04:21,014
27 And it came to pass that Moroni caused that his

138
00:04:21,014 --> 00:04:50,764
 army should be secreted in the valley which was

139
00:04:50,764 --> 00:05:20,514
 near the bank of the river Sidon, which was on the

140
00:05:20,514 --> 00:05:50,264
 west of the river Sidon in the wilderness

141
00:05:50,884 --> 00:06:04,217
28 And Moroni placed spies round about, that he

142
00:06:04,217 --> 00:06:17,55
 might know when the camp of the Lamanites should

143
00:06:17,55 --> 00:06:30,883
 come

144
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,357
29 And now, as Moroni knew the intention of the

145
00:06:32,357 --> 00:06:33,957
 Lamanites, that it was their intention to destroy

146
00:06:33,957 --> 00:06:35,557
 their brethren, or to subject them and bring them

147
00:06:35,557 --> 00:06:37,157
 into bondage that they might establish a kingdom

148
00:06:37,157 --> 00:06:38,757
 unto themselves over all the land

149
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:42,732
30 And he also knowing that it was the only desire

150
00:06:42,732 --> 00:06:46,732
 of the Nephites to preserve their lands, and

151
00:06:46,732 --> 00:06:50,732
 their liberty, and their church, therefore he thought

152
00:06:50,732 --> 00:06:54,732
 it no sin that he should defend them by stratagem;

153
00:06:54,732 --> 00:06:58,732
 therefore, he found by his spies which course the

154
00:06:58,732 --> 00:07:02,732
 Lamanites were to take

155
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:23,989
31 Therefore, he divided his army and brought a

156
00:07:23,989 --> 00:07:45,322
 part over into the valley, and concealed them on the

157
00:07:45,322 --> 00:08:06,655
 east, and on the south of the hill Riplah

158
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:38,453
32 And the remainder he concealed in the west

159
00:08:38,453 --> 00:09:10,453
 valley, on the west of the river Sidon, and so down

160
00:09:10,453 --> 00:09:42,453
 into the borders of the land Manti

161
00:09:42,148 --> 00:10:37,648
33 And thus having placed his army according to

162
00:10:37,648 --> 00:11:33,148
 his desire, he was prepared to meet them

163
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:36,46
34 And it came to pass that the Lamanites came up

164
00:11:36,46 --> 00:11:39,127
 on the north of the hill, where a part of the army

165
00:11:39,127 --> 00:11:41,794
 of Moroni was concealed

166
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:49,768
35 And as the Lamanites had passed the hill

167
00:11:49,768 --> 00:11:57,768
 Riplah, and came into the valley, and began to cross the

168
00:11:57,768 --> 00:12:05,768
 river Sidon, the army which was concealed on the

169
00:12:05,768 --> 00:12:13,768
 south of the hill, which was led by a man whose

170
00:12:13,768 --> 00:12:21,768
 name was Lehi, and he led his army forth and

171
00:12:21,768 --> 00:12:29,768
 encircled the Lamanites about on the east in their rear

172
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:47,616
36 And it came to pass that the Lamanites, when

173
00:12:47,616 --> 00:13:05,616
 they saw the Nephites coming upon them in their

174
00:13:05,616 --> 00:13:23,616
 rear, turned them about and began to contend with the

175
00:13:23,616 --> 00:13:41,616
 army of Lehi

176
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:52,054
37 And the work of death commenced on both sides,

177
00:13:52,054 --> 00:14:02,721
 but it was more dreadful on the part of the

178
00:14:02,721 --> 00:14:13,388
 Lamanites, for their nakedness was exposed to the heavy

179
00:14:13,388 --> 00:14:24,055
 blows of the Nephites with their swords and their

180
00:14:24,055 --> 00:14:34,722
 cimeters, which brought death almost at every

181
00:14:34,722 --> 00:14:45,389
 stroke

182
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:46,962
38 While on the other hand, there was now and then

183
00:14:46,962 --> 00:14:48,74
 a man fell among the Nephites, by their swords

184
00:14:48,74 --> 00:14:50,518
 and the loss of blood, they being shielded from the

185
00:14:50,518 --> 00:14:52,296
 more vital parts of the body, or the more vital

186
00:14:52,296 --> 00:14:54,074
 parts of the body being shielded from the strokes of

187
00:14:54,074 --> 00:14:55,852
 the Lamanites, by their breastplates, and their

188
00:14:55,852 --> 00:14:57,63
 armshields, and their head-plates; and thus the

189
00:14:57,63 --> 00:14:59,408
 Nephites did carry on the work of death among the

190
00:14:59,408 --> 00:15:01,186
 Lamanites

191
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:12,884
39 And it came to pass that the Lamanites became

192
00:15:12,884 --> 00:15:24,634
 frightened, because of the great destruction among

193
00:15:24,634 --> 00:15:36,384
 them, even until they began to flee towards the

194
00:15:36,384 --> 00:15:48,134
 river Sidon

195
00:15:48,981 --> 00:16:11,381
40 And they were pursued by Lehi and his men; and

196
00:16:11,381 --> 00:16:33,781
 they were driven by Lehi into the waters of Sidon,

197
00:16:33,781 --> 00:16:56,181
 and they crossed the waters of Sidon. And Lehi

198
00:16:56,181 --> 00:17:18,581
 retained his armies upon the bank of the river Sidon

199
00:17:18,581 --> 00:17:40,981
 that they should not cross

200
00:17:40,626 --> 00:18:12,626
41 And it came to pass that Moroni and his army

201
00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:44,626
 met the Lamanites in the valley, on the other side

202
00:18:44,626 --> 00:19:16,626
 of the river Sidon, and began to fall upon them and

203
00:19:16,626 --> 00:19:48,626
 to slay them

204
00:19:48,22 --> 00:19:50,887
42 And the Lamanites did flee again before them,

205
00:19:50,887 --> 00:19:53,554
 towards the land of Manti; and they were met again

206
00:19:53,554 --> 00:19:56,221
 by the armies of Moroni

207
00:19:56,195 --> 00:20:21,945
43 Now in this case the Lamanites did fight

208
00:20:21,945 --> 00:20:47,695
 exceedingly; yea, never had the Lamanites been known to

209
00:20:47,695 --> 00:21:13,445
 fight with such exceedingly great strength and

210
00:21:13,445 --> 00:21:39,195
 courage, no, not even from the beginning

211
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:41,465
44 And they were inspired by the Zoramites and the

212
00:21:41,465 --> 00:21:43,065
 Amalekites, who were their chief captains and

213
00:21:43,065 --> 00:21:44,665
 leaders, and by Zerahemnah, who was their chief

214
00:21:44,665 --> 00:21:46,265
 captain, or their chief leader and commander; yea, they

215
00:21:46,265 --> 00:21:47,865
 did fight like dragons, and many of the Nephites

216
00:21:47,865 --> 00:21:49,465
 were slain by their hands, yea, for they did smite

217
00:21:49,465 --> 00:21:51,065
 in two many of their head-plates, and they did

218
00:21:51,065 --> 00:21:52,665
 pierce many of their breastplates, and they did

219
00:21:52,665 --> 00:21:54,265
 smite off many of their arms; and thus the Lamanites

220
00:21:54,265 --> 00:21:55,865
 did smite in their fierce anger

221
00:21:55,814 --> 00:22:06,481
45 Nevertheless, the Nephites were inspired by a

222
00:22:06,481 --> 00:22:17,149
 better cause, for they were not fighting for

223
00:22:17,149 --> 00:22:27,815
 monarchy nor power but they were fighting for their

224
00:22:27,815 --> 00:22:38,482
 homes and their liberties, their wives and their

225
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:49,149
 children, and their all, yea, for their rites of

226
00:22:49,149 --> 00:22:59,816
 worship and their church

227
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:31,612
46 And they were doing that which they felt was

228
00:23:31,612 --> 00:24:03,612
 the duty which they owed to their God; for the Lord

229
00:24:03,612 --> 00:24:35,612
 had said unto them, and also unto their fathers,

230
00:24:35,612 --> 00:25:07,612
 that: Inasmuch as ye are not guilty of the first

231
00:25:07,612 --> 00:25:39,612
 offense, neither the second, ye shall not suffer

232
00:25:39,612 --> 00:26:11,612
 yourselves to be slain by the hands of your enemies

233
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:13,836
47 And again, the Lord has said that: Ye shall

234
00:26:13,836 --> 00:26:16,669
 defend your families even unto bloodshed. Therefore

235
00:26:16,669 --> 00:26:19,502
 for this cause were the Nephites contending with

236
00:26:19,502 --> 00:26:22,335
 the Lamanites, to defend themselves, and their

237
00:26:22,335 --> 00:26:25,168
 families, and their lands, their country, and their

238
00:26:25,168 --> 00:26:28,001
 rights, and their religion

239
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:36,01
48 And it came to pass that when the men of Moroni

240
00:26:36,01 --> 00:26:43,867
 saw the fierceness and the anger of the

241
00:26:43,867 --> 00:26:51,724
 Lamanites, they were about to shrink and flee from them.

242
00:26:51,724 --> 00:26:59,581
 And Moroni, perceiving their intent, sent forth and

243
00:26:59,581 --> 00:27:07,438
 inspired their hearts with these thoughts—yea, the

244
00:27:07,438 --> 00:27:15,295
 thoughts of their lands, their liberty, yea,

245
00:27:15,295 --> 00:27:23,152
 their freedom from bondage

246
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:27,976
49 And it came to pass that they turned upon the

247
00:27:27,976 --> 00:27:31,976
 Lamanites, and they cried with one voice unto the

248
00:27:31,976 --> 00:27:35,976
 Lord their God, for their liberty and their freedom

249
00:27:35,976 --> 00:27:39,976
 from bondage

250
00:03:51,264 --> 00:04:30,931
52 Therefore the armies of Moroni encircled them

251
00:04:30,931 --> 00:05:10,598
 about, yea, even on both sides of the river, for

252
00:05:10,598 --> 00:05:50,265
 behold, on the east were the men of Lehi

253
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:58,884
53 Therefore when Zerahemnah saw the men of Lehi

254
00:05:58,884 --> 00:06:06,884
 on the east of the river Sidon, and the armies of

255
00:06:06,884 --> 00:06:14,884
 Moroni on the west of the river Sidon, that they

256
00:06:14,884 --> 00:06:22,884
 were encircled about by the Nephites, they were

257
00:06:22,884 --> 00:06:30,884
 struck with terror

258
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:31,09
54 Now Moroni, when he saw their terror, commanded

259
00:06:31,09 --> 00:06:31,423
 his men that they should stop shedding their

260
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:31,756
 blood.
