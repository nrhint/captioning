00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:07,8
Chapter 24 The Lamanites come against the people

2
00:00:07,8 --> 00:00:15,6
 of God—The Anti-Nephi-Lehies rejoice in Christ and

3
00:00:15,6 --> 00:00:23,4
 are visited by angels—They choose to suffer death

4
00:00:23,4 --> 00:00:31,2
 rather than to defend themselves—More Lamanites

5
00:00:31,2 --> 00:00:39,0
 are converted. About 90–77 B.C.

6
00:00:39,873 --> 00:01:03,873
1 And it came to pass that the Amalekites and the

7
00:01:03,873 --> 00:01:27,873
 Amulonites and the Lamanites who were in the land

8
00:01:27,873 --> 00:01:51,873
 of Amulon, and also in the land of Helam, and who

9
00:01:51,873 --> 00:02:15,873
 were in the land of Jerusalem, and in fine, in all

10
00:02:15,873 --> 00:02:39,873
 the land round about, who had not been converted

11
00:02:39,873 --> 00:03:03,873
 and had not taken upon them the name of

12
00:03:03,873 --> 00:03:27,873
 Anti-Nephi-Lehi, were stirred up by the Amalekites and by

13
00:03:27,873 --> 00:03:51,873
 the Amulonites to anger against their brethren

14
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:57,664
2 And their hatred became exceedingly sore against

15
00:03:57,664 --> 00:04:04,064
 them, even insomuch that they began to rebel

16
00:04:04,064 --> 00:04:10,464
 against their king, insomuch that they would not that

17
00:04:10,464 --> 00:04:16,864
 he should be their king; therefore, they took up

18
00:04:16,864 --> 00:04:23,264
 arms against the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi

19
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:35,163
3 Now the king conferred the kingdom upon his son,

20
00:04:35,163 --> 00:04:47,163
 and he called his name Anti-Nephi-Lehi

21
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,754
4 And the king died in that selfsame year that the

22
00:04:49,754 --> 00:04:52,421
 Lamanites began to make preparations for war

23
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:55,088
 against the people of God

24
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:59,394
5 Now when Ammon and his brethren and all those

25
00:04:59,394 --> 00:05:03,727
 who had come up with him saw the preparations of the

26
00:05:03,727 --> 00:05:08,06
 Lamanites to destroy their brethren, they came

27
00:05:08,06 --> 00:05:12,393
 forth to the land of Midian, and there Ammon met all

28
00:05:12,393 --> 00:05:16,726
 his brethren; and from thence they came to the

29
00:05:16,726 --> 00:05:21,059
 land of Ishmael that they might hold a council with

30
00:05:21,059 --> 00:05:25,392
 Lamoni and also with his brother Anti-Nephi-Lehi,

31
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:29,725
 what they should do to defend themselves against

32
00:05:29,725 --> 00:05:34,058
 the Lamanites

33
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:38,935
6 Now there was not one soul among all the people

34
00:05:38,935 --> 00:05:42,935
 who had been converted unto the Lord that would

35
00:05:42,935 --> 00:05:46,935
 take up arms against their brethren; nay, they would

36
00:05:46,935 --> 00:05:50,935
 not even make any preparations for war; yea, and

37
00:05:50,935 --> 00:05:54,935
 also their king commanded them that they should

38
00:05:54,935 --> 00:05:58,935
 not

39
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,525
7 Now, these are the words which he said unto the

40
00:06:01,525 --> 00:06:04,192
 people concerning the matter: I thank my God, my

41
00:06:04,192 --> 00:06:06,859
 beloved people, that our great God has in goodness

42
00:06:06,859 --> 00:06:09,526
 sent these our brethren, the Nephites, unto us to

43
00:06:09,526 --> 00:06:12,193
 preach unto us, and to convince us of the

44
00:06:12,193 --> 00:06:14,861
 traditions of our wicked fathers

45
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:16,808
8 And behold, I thank my great God that he has

46
00:06:16,808 --> 00:06:18,808
 given us a portion of his Spirit to soften our

47
00:06:18,808 --> 00:06:20,808
 hearts, that we have opened a correspondence with these

48
00:06:20,808 --> 00:06:22,808
 brethren, the Nephites

49
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:28,782
9 And behold, I also thank my God, that by opening

50
00:06:28,782 --> 00:06:34,782
 this correspondence we have been convinced of our

51
00:06:34,782 --> 00:06:40,782
 sins, and of the many murders which we have

52
00:06:40,782 --> 00:06:46,782
 committed

53
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:47,206
10 And I also thank my God, yea, my great God,

54
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:47,706
 that he hath granted unto us that we might repent of

55
00:06:47,706 --> 00:06:48,206
 these things, and also that he hath forgiven us of

56
00:06:48,206 --> 00:06:48,706
 those our many sins and murders which we have

57
00:06:48,706 --> 00:06:49,206
 committed, and taken away the guilt from our hearts,

58
00:06:49,206 --> 00:06:49,706
 through the merits of his Son

59
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:53,272
11 And now behold, my brethren, since it has been

60
00:06:53,272 --> 00:06:56,701
 all that we could do (as we were the most lost of

61
00:06:56,701 --> 00:07:00,13
 all mankind) to repent of all our sins and the

62
00:07:00,13 --> 00:07:03,559
 many murders which we have committed, and to get God

63
00:07:03,559 --> 00:07:06,988
 to take them away from our hearts, for it was all

64
00:07:06,988 --> 00:07:10,417
 we could do to repent sufficiently before God that

65
00:07:10,417 --> 00:07:13,846
 he would take away our stain

66
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:23,517
12 Now, my best beloved brethren, since God hath

67
00:07:23,517 --> 00:07:33,267
 taken away our stains, and our swords have become

68
00:07:33,267 --> 00:07:43,017
 bright, then let us stain our swords no more with

69
00:07:43,017 --> 00:07:52,767
 the blood of our brethren

70
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:59,038
13 Behold, I say unto you, Nay, let us retain our

71
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:05,871
 swords that they be not stained with the blood of

72
00:08:05,871 --> 00:08:12,704
 our brethren; for perhaps, if we should stain our

73
00:08:12,704 --> 00:08:19,537
 swords again they can no more be washed bright

74
00:08:19,537 --> 00:08:26,37
 through the blood of the Son of our great God, which

75
00:08:26,37 --> 00:08:33,203
 shall be shed for the atonement of our sins

76
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:43,263
14 And the great God has had mercy on us, and made

77
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:53,013
 these things known unto us that we might not

78
00:08:53,013 --> 00:09:02,763
 perish; yea, and he has made these things known unto

79
00:09:02,763 --> 00:09:12,513
 us beforehand, because he loveth our souls as well

80
00:09:12,513 --> 00:09:22,263
 as he loveth our children; therefore, in his mercy

81
00:09:22,263 --> 00:09:32,013
 he doth visit us by his angels, that the plan of

82
00:09:32,013 --> 00:09:41,763
 salvation might be made known unto us as well as

83
00:09:41,763 --> 00:09:51,513
 unto future generations

84
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:56,357
15 Oh, how merciful is our God! And now behold,

85
00:09:56,357 --> 00:10:01,557
 since it has been as much as we could do to get our

86
00:10:01,557 --> 00:10:06,757
 stains taken away from us, and our swords are made

87
00:10:06,757 --> 00:10:11,957
 bright, let us hide them away that they may be

88
00:10:11,957 --> 00:10:17,157
 kept bright, as a testimony to our God at the last

89
00:10:17,157 --> 00:10:22,357
 day, or at the day that we shall be brought to

90
00:10:22,357 --> 00:10:27,557
 stand before him to be judged, that we have not

91
00:10:27,557 --> 00:10:32,757
 stained our swords in the blood of our brethren since he

92
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:37,957
 imparted his word unto us and has made us clean

93
00:10:37,957 --> 00:10:43,157
 thereby

94
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:50,723
16 And now, my brethren, if our brethren seek to

95
00:10:50,723 --> 00:10:58,437
 destroy us, behold, we will hide away our swords,

96
00:10:58,437 --> 00:11:06,151
 yea, even we will bury them deep in the earth, that

97
00:11:06,151 --> 00:11:13,865
 they may be kept bright, as a testimony that we

98
00:11:13,865 --> 00:11:21,579
 have never used them, at the last day; and if our

99
00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:29,293
 brethren destroy us, behold, we shall go to our God

100
00:11:29,293 --> 00:11:37,007
 and shall be saved

101
00:11:37,63 --> 00:11:44,13
17 And now it came to pass that when the king had

102
00:11:44,13 --> 00:11:50,63
 made an end of these sayings, and all the people

103
00:11:50,63 --> 00:11:57,13
 were assembled together, they took their swords,

104
00:11:57,13 --> 00:12:03,63
 and all the weapons which were used for the shedding

105
00:12:03,63 --> 00:12:10,13
 of man’s blood, and they did bury them up deep in

106
00:12:10,13 --> 00:12:16,63
 the earth

107
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:21,569
18 And this they did, it being in their view a

108
00:12:21,569 --> 00:12:27,069
 testimony to God, and also to men, that they never

109
00:12:27,069 --> 00:12:32,569
 would use weapons again for the shedding of man’s

110
00:12:32,569 --> 00:12:38,069
 blood; and this they did, vouching and covenanting

111
00:12:38,069 --> 00:12:43,569
 with God, that rather than shed the blood of their

112
00:12:43,569 --> 00:12:49,069
 brethren they would give up their own lives; and

113
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:54,569
 rather than take away from a brother they would

114
00:12:54,569 --> 00:13:00,069
 give unto him; and rather than spend their days in

115
00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:05,569
 idleness they would labor abundantly with their

116
00:13:05,569 --> 00:13:11,069
 hands

117
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:18,491
19 And thus we see that, when these Lamanites were

118
00:13:18,491 --> 00:13:25,324
 brought to believe and to know the truth, they

119
00:13:25,324 --> 00:13:32,157
 were firm, and would suffer even unto death rather

120
00:13:32,157 --> 00:13:38,99
 than commit sin; and thus we see that they buried

121
00:13:38,99 --> 00:13:45,823
 their weapons of peace, or they buried the weapons

122
00:13:45,823 --> 00:13:52,656
 of war, for peace

123
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:59,165
20 And it came to pass that their brethren, the

124
00:13:59,165 --> 00:14:05,832
 Lamanites, made preparations for war, and came up to

125
00:14:05,832 --> 00:14:12,499
 the land of Nephi for the purpose of destroying

126
00:14:12,499 --> 00:14:19,166
 the king, and to place another in his stead, and

127
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:25,833
 also of destroying the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi out

128
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:32,5
 of the land

129
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:35,801
21 Now when the people saw that they were coming

130
00:14:35,801 --> 00:14:39,23
 against them they went out to meet them, and

131
00:14:39,23 --> 00:14:42,659
 prostrated themselves before them to the earth, and

132
00:14:42,659 --> 00:14:46,088
 began to call on the name of the Lord; and thus they

133
00:14:46,088 --> 00:14:49,517
 were in this attitude when the Lamanites began to

134
00:14:49,517 --> 00:14:52,946
 fall upon them, and began to slay them with the

135
00:14:52,946 --> 00:14:56,375
 sword

136
00:14:56,295 --> 00:15:46,045
22 And thus without meeting any resistance, they

137
00:15:46,045 --> 00:16:35,795
 did slay a thousand and five of them; and we know

138
00:16:35,795 --> 00:17:25,545
 that they are blessed, for they have gone to dwell

139
00:17:25,545 --> 00:18:15,295
 with their God

140
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:28,994
23 Now when the Lamanites saw that their brethren

141
00:18:28,994 --> 00:18:42,327
 would not flee from the sword, neither would they

142
00:18:42,327 --> 00:18:55,66
 turn aside to the right hand or to the left, but

143
00:18:55,66 --> 00:19:08,993
 that they would lie down and perish, and praised

144
00:19:08,993 --> 00:19:22,326
 God even in the very act of perishing under the

145
00:19:22,326 --> 00:19:35,659
 sword

146
00:00:39,873 --> 00:01:18,273
26 And it came to pass that the people of God were

147
00:01:18,273 --> 00:01:56,673
 joined that day by more than the number who had

148
00:01:56,673 --> 00:02:35,073
 been slain; and those who had been slain were

149
00:02:35,073 --> 00:03:13,473
 righteous people, therefore we have no reason to doubt

150
00:03:13,473 --> 00:03:51,873
 but what they were saved

151
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:57,664
27 And there was not a wicked man slain among

152
00:03:57,664 --> 00:04:04,064
 them; but there were more than a thousand brought to

153
00:04:04,064 --> 00:04:10,464
 the knowledge of the truth; thus we see that the

154
00:04:10,464 --> 00:04:16,864
 Lord worketh in many ways to the salvation of his

155
00:04:16,864 --> 00:04:23,264
 people

156
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:29,163
28 Now the greatest number of those of the

157
00:04:29,163 --> 00:04:35,163
 Lamanites who slew so many of their brethren were

158
00:04:35,163 --> 00:04:41,163
 Amalekites and Amulonites, the greatest number of whom

159
00:04:41,163 --> 00:04:47,163
 were after the order of the Nehors

160
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,087
29 Now, among those who joined the people of the

161
00:04:49,087 --> 00:04:51,087
 Lord, there were none who were Amalekites or

162
00:04:51,087 --> 00:04:53,087
 Amulonites, or who were of the order of Nehor, but they

163
00:04:53,087 --> 00:04:55,087
 were actual descendants of Laman and Lemuel

164
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:55,204
30 And thus we can plainly discern, that after a

165
00:04:55,204 --> 00:04:55,347
 people have been once enlightened by the Spirit of

166
00:04:55,347 --> 00:04:55,49
 God, and have had great knowledge of things

167
00:04:55,49 --> 00:04:55,633
 pertaining to righteousness, and then have fallen away

168
00:04:55,633 --> 00:04:55,776
 into sin and transgression, they become more

169
00:04:55,776 --> 00:04:55,919
 hardened, and thus their state becomes worse than though

170
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:56,062
 they had never known these things.
