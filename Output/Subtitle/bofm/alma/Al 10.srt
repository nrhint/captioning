00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:10,167
Chapter 10 Lehi descended from Manasseh—Amulek

2
00:00:10,167 --> 00:00:20,334
 recounts the angelic command that he care for

3
00:00:20,334 --> 00:00:30,501
 Alma—The prayers of the righteous cause the people to be

4
00:00:30,501 --> 00:00:40,668
 spared—Unrighteous lawyers and judges lay the

5
00:00:40,668 --> 00:00:50,835
 foundation of the destruction of the people. About

6
00:00:50,835 --> 00:01:01,002
 82 B.C.

7
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:05,628
1 Now these are the words which Amulek preached

8
00:01:05,628 --> 00:01:09,628
 unto the people who were in the land of Ammonihah,

9
00:01:09,628 --> 00:01:13,628
 saying

10
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:20,773
2 I am Amulek; I am the son of Giddonah, who was

11
00:01:20,773 --> 00:01:28,173
 the son of Ishmael, who was a descendant of

12
00:01:28,173 --> 00:01:35,573
 Aminadi; and it was that same Aminadi who interpreted the

13
00:01:35,573 --> 00:01:42,973
 writing which was upon the wall of the temple,

14
00:01:42,973 --> 00:01:50,373
 which was written by the finger of God

15
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:56,744
3 And Aminadi was a descendant of Nephi, who was

16
00:01:56,744 --> 00:02:03,144
 the son of Lehi, who came out of the land of

17
00:02:03,144 --> 00:02:09,544
 Jerusalem, who was a descendant of Manasseh, who was the

18
00:02:09,544 --> 00:02:15,944
 son of Joseph who was sold into Egypt by the

19
00:02:15,944 --> 00:02:22,344
 hands of his brethren

20
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:29,859
4 And behold, I am also a man of no small

21
00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:37,109
 reputation among all those who know me; yea, and behold, I

22
00:02:37,109 --> 00:02:44,359
 have many kindreds and friends, and I have also

23
00:02:44,359 --> 00:02:51,609
 acquired much riches by the hand of my industry

24
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:57,171
5 Nevertheless, after all this, I never have known

25
00:02:57,171 --> 00:03:03,171
 much of the ways of the Lord, and his mysteries

26
00:03:03,171 --> 00:03:09,171
 and marvelous power. I said I never had known much

27
00:03:09,171 --> 00:03:15,171
 of these things; but behold, I mistake, for I have

28
00:03:15,171 --> 00:03:21,171
 seen much of his mysteries and his marvelous

29
00:03:21,171 --> 00:03:27,171
 power; yea, even in the preservation of the lives of

30
00:03:27,171 --> 00:03:33,171
 this people

31
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:39,399
6 Nevertheless, I did harden my heart, for I was

32
00:03:39,399 --> 00:03:45,685
 called many times and I would not hear; therefore I

33
00:03:45,685 --> 00:03:51,971
 knew concerning these things, yet I would not

34
00:03:51,971 --> 00:03:58,257
 know; therefore I went on rebelling against God, in

35
00:03:58,257 --> 00:04:04,543
 the wickedness of my heart, even until the fourth

36
00:04:04,543 --> 00:04:10,829
 day of this seventh month, which is in the tenth

37
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:17,115
 year of the reign of the judges

38
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:24,091
7 As I was journeying to see a very near kindred,

39
00:04:24,091 --> 00:04:30,591
 behold an angel of the Lord appeared unto me and

40
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:37,091
 said: Amulek, return to thine own house, for thou

41
00:04:37,091 --> 00:04:43,591
 shalt feed a prophet of the Lord; yea, a holy man,

42
00:04:43,591 --> 00:04:50,091
 who is a chosen man of God; for he has fasted many

43
00:04:50,091 --> 00:04:56,591
 days because of the sins of this people, and he

44
00:04:56,591 --> 00:05:03,091
 is an hungered, and thou shalt receive him into thy

45
00:05:03,091 --> 00:05:09,591
 house and feed him, and he shall bless thee and

46
00:05:09,591 --> 00:05:16,091
 thy house; and the blessing of the Lord shall rest

47
00:05:16,091 --> 00:05:22,591
 upon thee and thy house

48
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:28,055
8 And it came to pass that I obeyed the voice of

49
00:05:28,055 --> 00:05:33,388
 the angel, and returned towards my house. And as I

50
00:05:33,388 --> 00:05:38,721
 was going thither I found the man whom the angel

51
00:05:38,721 --> 00:05:44,054
 said unto me: Thou shalt receive into thy house—and

52
00:05:44,054 --> 00:05:49,387
 behold it was this same man who has been speaking

53
00:05:49,387 --> 00:05:54,72
 unto you concerning the things of God

54
00:05:54,754 --> 00:06:00,087
9 And the angel said unto me he is a holy man;

55
00:06:00,087 --> 00:06:05,42
 wherefore I know he is a holy man because it was said

56
00:06:05,42 --> 00:06:10,753
 by an angel of God

57
00:06:10,47 --> 00:06:15,637
10 And again, I know that the things whereof he

58
00:06:15,637 --> 00:06:20,804
 hath testified are true; for behold I say unto you,

59
00:06:20,804 --> 00:06:25,971
 that as the Lord liveth, even so has he sent his

60
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:31,138
 angel to make these things manifest unto me; and

61
00:06:31,138 --> 00:06:36,305
 this he has done while this Alma hath dwelt at my

62
00:06:36,305 --> 00:06:41,472
 house

63
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:47,0
11 For behold, he hath blessed mine house, he hath

64
00:06:47,0 --> 00:06:52,833
 blessed me, and my women, and my children, and my

65
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:58,666
 father and my kinsfolk; yea, even all my kindred

66
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:04,499
 hath he blessed, and the blessing of the Lord hath

67
00:07:04,499 --> 00:07:10,332
 rested upon us according to the words which he

68
00:07:10,332 --> 00:07:16,165
 spake

69
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:22,369
12 And now, when Amulek had spoken these words the

70
00:07:22,369 --> 00:07:28,369
 people began to be astonished, seeing there was

71
00:07:28,369 --> 00:07:34,369
 more than one witness who testified of the things

72
00:07:34,369 --> 00:07:40,369
 whereof they were accused, and also of the things

73
00:07:40,369 --> 00:07:46,369
 which were to come, according to the spirit of

74
00:07:46,369 --> 00:07:52,369
 prophecy which was in them

75
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:57,594
13 Nevertheless, there were some among them who

76
00:07:57,594 --> 00:08:03,15
 thought to question them, that by their cunning

77
00:08:03,15 --> 00:08:08,706
 devices they might catch them in their words, that

78
00:08:08,706 --> 00:08:14,262
 they might find witness against them, that they might

79
00:08:14,262 --> 00:08:19,818
 deliver them to their judges that they might be

80
00:08:19,818 --> 00:08:25,374
 judged according to the law, and that they might be

81
00:08:25,374 --> 00:08:30,93
 slain or cast into prison, according to the crime

82
00:08:30,93 --> 00:08:36,486
 which they could make appear or witness against

83
00:08:36,486 --> 00:08:42,042
 them

84
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:49,089
14 Now it was those men who sought to destroy

85
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:55,689
 them, who were lawyers, who were hired or appointed by

86
00:08:55,689 --> 00:09:02,289
 the people to administer the law at their times

87
00:09:02,289 --> 00:09:08,889
 of trials, or at the trials of the crimes of the

88
00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:15,489
 people before the judges

89
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:20,338
15 Now these lawyers were learned in all the arts

90
00:09:20,338 --> 00:09:25,588
 and cunning of the people; and this was to enable

91
00:09:25,588 --> 00:09:30,838
 them that they might be skilful in their

92
00:09:30,838 --> 00:09:36,088
 profession

93
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:41,342
16 And it came to pass that they began to question

94
00:09:41,342 --> 00:09:46,342
 Amulek, that thereby they might make him cross

95
00:09:46,342 --> 00:09:51,342
 his words, or contradict the words which he should

96
00:09:51,342 --> 00:09:56,342
 speak

97
00:09:56,863 --> 00:10:04,72
17 Now they knew not that Amulek could know of

98
00:10:04,72 --> 00:10:12,577
 their designs. But it came to pass as they began to

99
00:10:12,577 --> 00:10:20,434
 question him, he perceived their thoughts, and he

100
00:10:20,434 --> 00:10:28,291
 said unto them: O ye wicked and perverse

101
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:36,148
 generation, ye lawyers and hypocrites, for ye are laying the

102
00:10:36,148 --> 00:10:44,005
 foundations of the devil; for ye are laying traps

103
00:10:44,005 --> 00:10:51,862
 and snares to catch the holy ones of God

104
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:56,251
18 Ye are laying plans to pervert the ways of the

105
00:10:56,251 --> 00:11:01,251
 righteous, and to bring down the wrath of God upon

106
00:11:01,251 --> 00:11:06,251
 your heads, even to the utter destruction of this

107
00:11:06,251 --> 00:11:11,251
 people

108
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:16,415
19 Yea, well did Mosiah say, who was our last

109
00:11:16,415 --> 00:11:21,526
 king, when he was about to deliver up the kingdom,

110
00:11:21,526 --> 00:11:26,637
 having no one to confer it upon, causing that this

111
00:11:26,637 --> 00:11:31,748
 people should be governed by their own voices—yea,

112
00:11:31,748 --> 00:11:36,859
 well did he say that if the time should come that

113
00:11:36,859 --> 00:11:41,97
 the voice of this people should choose iniquity,

114
00:11:41,97 --> 00:11:47,081
 that is, if the time should come that this people

115
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:52,192
 should fall into transgression, they would be ripe

116
00:11:52,192 --> 00:11:57,303
 for destruction

117
00:11:57,517 --> 00:12:05,017
20 And now I say unto you that well doth the Lord

118
00:12:05,017 --> 00:12:12,517
 judge of your iniquities; well doth he cry unto

119
00:12:12,517 --> 00:12:20,017
 this people, by the voice of his angels: Repent ye,

120
00:12:20,017 --> 00:12:27,517
 repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand

121
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:35,08
21 Yea, well doth he cry, by the voice of his

122
00:12:35,08 --> 00:12:42,413
 angels that: I will come down among my people, with

123
00:12:42,413 --> 00:12:49,746
 equity and justice in my hands

124
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:55,235
22 Yea, and I say unto you that if it were not for

125
00:12:55,235 --> 00:13:01,235
 the prayers of the righteous, who are now in the

126
00:13:01,235 --> 00:13:07,235
 land, that ye would even now be visited with utter

127
00:13:07,235 --> 00:13:13,235
 destruction; yet it would not be by flood, as

128
00:13:13,235 --> 00:13:19,235
 were the people in the days of Noah, but it would be

129
00:13:19,235 --> 00:13:25,235
 by famine, and by pestilence, and the sword

130
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:32,328
23 But it is by the prayers of the righteous that

131
00:13:32,328 --> 00:13:39,185
 ye are spared; now therefore, if ye will cast out

132
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:46,042
 the righteous from among you then will not the

133
00:13:46,042 --> 00:13:52,899
 Lord stay his hand; but in his fierce anger he will

134
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:59,756
 come out against you; then ye shall be smitten by

135
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:06,613
 famine, and by pestilence, and by the sword; and

136
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:13,47
 the time is soon at hand except ye repent

137
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:20,936
24 And now it came to pass that the people were

138
00:14:20,936 --> 00:14:28,186
 more angry with Amulek, and they cried out, saying:

139
00:14:28,186 --> 00:14:35,436
 This man doth revile against our laws which are

140
00:14:35,436 --> 00:14:42,686
 just, and our wise lawyers whom we have selected

141
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:49,181
25 But Amulek stretched forth his hand, and cried

142
00:14:49,181 --> 00:14:56,181
 the mightier unto them, saying: O ye wicked and

143
00:14:56,181 --> 00:15:03,181
 perverse generation, why hath Satan got such great

144
00:15:03,181 --> 00:15:10,181
 hold upon your hearts? Why will ye yield yourselves

145
00:15:10,181 --> 00:15:17,181
 unto him that he may have power over you, to

146
00:15:17,181 --> 00:15:24,181
 blind your eyes, that ye will not understand the words

147
00:15:24,181 --> 00:15:31,181
 which are spoken, according to their truth

148
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:38,097
26 For behold, have I testified against your law?

149
00:15:38,097 --> 00:15:44,597
 Ye do not understand; ye say that I have spoken

150
00:15:44,597 --> 00:15:51,097
 against your law; but I have not, but I have spoken

151
00:15:51,097 --> 00:15:57,597
 in favor of your law, to your condemnation

152
00:15:57,89 --> 00:16:03,39
27 And now behold, I say unto you, that the

153
00:16:03,39 --> 00:16:08,89
 foundation of the destruction of this people is

154
00:16:08,89 --> 00:16:14,39
 beginning to be laid by the unrighteousness of your

155
00:16:14,39 --> 00:16:19,89
 lawyers and your judges

156
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:25,145
28 And now it came to pass that when Amulek had

157
00:16:25,145 --> 00:16:31,145
 spoken these words the people cried out against him,

158
00:16:31,145 --> 00:16:37,145
 saying: Now we know that this man is a child of

159
00:16:37,145 --> 00:16:43,145
 the devil, for he hath lied unto us; for he hath

160
00:16:43,145 --> 00:16:49,145
 spoken against our law. And now he says that he has

161
00:16:49,145 --> 00:16:55,145
 not spoken against it

162
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:59,547
29 And again, he has reviled against our lawyers,

163
00:16:59,547 --> 00:17:04,047
 and our judges

164
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:08,824
30 And it came to pass that the lawyers put it

165
00:17:08,824 --> 00:17:12,824
 into their hearts that they should remember these

166
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:16,824
 things against him

167
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:23,802
31 And there was one among them whose name was

168
00:17:23,802 --> 00:17:30,802
 Zeezrom. Now he was the foremost to accuse Amulek and

169
00:17:30,802 --> 00:17:37,802
 Alma, he being one of the most expert among them,

170
00:17:37,802 --> 00:17:44,802
 having much business to do among the people

171
00:17:44,33 --> 00:17:46,83
32 Now the object of these lawyers was to get

172
00:17:46,83 --> 00:17:49,33
 gain; and they got gain according to their employ.
