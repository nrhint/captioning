1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:11,143
Chapter 13 Men are called as high priests because

2
00:00:11,143 --> 00:00:22,286
 of their exceeding faith and good works—They are

3
00:00:22,286 --> 00:00:33,429
 to teach the commandments—Through righteousness

4
00:00:33,429 --> 00:00:44,572
 they are sanctified and enter into the rest of the

5
00:00:44,572 --> 00:00:55,715
 Lord—Melchizedek was one of these—Angels are

6
00:00:55,715 --> 00:01:06,858
 declaring glad tidings throughout the land—They will

7
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:18,001
 declare the actual coming of Christ. About 82 B.C.

8
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:23,631
1 And again, my brethren, I would cite your minds

9
00:01:23,631 --> 00:01:28,917
 forward to the time when the Lord God gave these

10
00:01:28,917 --> 00:01:34,203
 commandments unto his children; and I would that ye

11
00:01:34,203 --> 00:01:39,489
 should remember that the Lord God ordained

12
00:01:39,489 --> 00:01:44,775
 priests, after his holy order, which was after the order

13
00:01:44,775 --> 00:01:50,061
 of his Son, to teach these things unto the

14
00:01:50,061 --> 00:01:55,347
 people

15
00:01:55,782 --> 00:02:02,032
2 And those priests were ordained after the order

16
00:02:02,032 --> 00:02:08,282
 of his Son, in a manner that thereby the people

17
00:02:08,282 --> 00:02:14,532
 might know in what manner to look forward to his Son

18
00:02:14,532 --> 00:02:20,782
 for redemption

19
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:26,674
3 And this is the manner after which they were

20
00:02:26,674 --> 00:02:32,574
 ordained—being called and prepared from the

21
00:02:32,574 --> 00:02:38,474
 foundation of the world according to the foreknowledge of

22
00:02:38,474 --> 00:02:44,374
 God, on account of their exceeding faith and good

23
00:02:44,374 --> 00:02:50,274
 works; in the first place being left to choose good

24
00:02:50,274 --> 00:02:56,174
 or evil; therefore they having chosen good, and

25
00:02:56,174 --> 00:03:02,074
 exercising exceedingly great faith, are called with

26
00:03:02,074 --> 00:03:07,974
 a holy calling, yea, with that holy calling which

27
00:03:07,974 --> 00:03:13,874
 was prepared with, and according to, a

28
00:03:13,874 --> 00:03:19,774
 preparatory redemption for such

29
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:25,666
4 And thus they have been called to this holy

30
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:31,833
 calling on account of their faith, while others would

31
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:38,0
 reject the Spirit of God on account of the

32
00:03:38,0 --> 00:03:44,167
 hardness of their hearts and blindness of their minds,

33
00:03:44,167 --> 00:03:50,334
 while, if it had not been for this they might have

34
00:03:50,334 --> 00:03:56,501
 had as great privilege as their brethren

35
00:03:56,47 --> 00:04:02,637
5 Or in fine, in the first place they were on the

36
00:04:02,637 --> 00:04:08,804
 same standing with their brethren; thus this holy

37
00:04:08,804 --> 00:04:14,971
 calling being prepared from the foundation of the

38
00:04:14,971 --> 00:04:21,138
 world for such as would not harden their hearts,

39
00:04:21,138 --> 00:04:27,305
 being in and through the atonement of the Only

40
00:04:27,305 --> 00:04:33,472
 Begotten Son, who was prepared

41
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:38,773
6 And thus being called by this holy calling, and

42
00:04:38,773 --> 00:04:44,373
 ordained unto the high priesthood of the holy

43
00:04:44,373 --> 00:04:49,973
 order of God, to teach his commandments unto the

44
00:04:49,973 --> 00:04:55,573
 children of men, that they also might enter into his

45
00:04:55,573 --> 00:05:01,173
 rest

46
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:07,434
7 This high priesthood being after the order of

47
00:05:07,434 --> 00:05:13,434
 his Son, which order was from the foundation of the

48
00:05:13,434 --> 00:05:19,434
 world; or in other words, being without beginning

49
00:05:19,434 --> 00:05:25,434
 of days or end of years, being prepared from

50
00:05:25,434 --> 00:05:31,434
 eternity to all eternity, according to his

51
00:05:31,434 --> 00:05:37,434
 foreknowledge of all things

52
00:05:37,37 --> 00:05:42,87
8 Now they were ordained after this manner—being

53
00:05:42,87 --> 00:05:48,37
 called with a holy calling, and ordained with a

54
00:05:48,37 --> 00:05:53,87
 holy ordinance, and taking upon them the high

55
00:05:53,87 --> 00:05:59,37
 priesthood of the holy order, which calling, and

56
00:05:59,37 --> 00:06:04,87
 ordinance, and high priesthood, is without beginning or

57
00:06:04,87 --> 00:06:10,37
 end

58
00:06:10,87 --> 00:06:17,471
9 Thus they become high priests forever, after the

59
00:06:17,471 --> 00:06:24,07
 order of the Son, the Only Begotten of the

60
00:06:24,07 --> 00:06:30,671
 Father, who is without beginning of days or end of

61
00:06:30,671 --> 00:06:37,27
 years, who is full of grace, equity, and truth. And

62
00:06:37,27 --> 00:06:43,87
 thus it is. Amen

63
00:06:43,87 --> 00:06:49,87
10 Now, as I said concerning the holy order, or

64
00:06:49,87 --> 00:06:55,87
 this high priesthood, there were many who were

65
00:06:55,87 --> 00:07:01,87
 ordained and became high priests of God; and it was on

66
00:07:01,87 --> 00:07:07,87
 account of their exceeding faith and repentance,

67
00:07:07,87 --> 00:07:13,87
 and their righteousness before God, they choosing

68
00:07:13,87 --> 00:07:19,87
 to repent and work righteousness rather than to

69
00:07:19,87 --> 00:07:25,87
 perish

70
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:31,878
11 Therefore they were called after this holy

71
00:07:31,878 --> 00:07:38,211
 order, and were sanctified, and their garments were

72
00:07:38,211 --> 00:07:44,544
 washed white through the blood of the Lamb

73
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:51,864
12 Now they, after being sanctified by the Holy

74
00:07:51,864 --> 00:07:59,197
 Ghost, having their garments made white, being pure

75
00:07:59,197 --> 00:08:06,53
 and spotless before God, could not look upon sin

76
00:08:06,53 --> 00:08:13,863
 save it were with abhorrence; and there were many,

77
00:08:13,863 --> 00:08:21,196
 exceedingly great many, who were made pure and

78
00:08:21,196 --> 00:08:28,529
 entered into the rest of the Lord their God

79
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:33,674
13 And now, my brethren, I would that ye should

80
00:08:33,674 --> 00:08:39,174
 humble yourselves before God, and bring forth fruit

81
00:08:39,174 --> 00:08:44,674
 meet for repentance, that ye may also enter into

82
00:08:44,674 --> 00:08:50,174
 that rest

83
00:08:50,43 --> 00:08:56,68
14 Yea, humble yourselves even as the people in

84
00:08:56,68 --> 00:09:02,93
 the days of Melchizedek, who was also a high priest

85
00:09:02,93 --> 00:09:09,18
 after this same order which I have spoken, who

86
00:09:09,18 --> 00:09:15,43
 also took upon him the high priesthood forever

87
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:23,021
15 And it was this same Melchizedek to whom

88
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:30,354
 Abraham paid tithes; yea, even our father Abraham paid

89
00:09:30,354 --> 00:09:37,687
 tithes of one-tenth part of all he possessed

90
00:09:37,41 --> 00:09:44,077
16 Now these ordinances were given after this

91
00:09:44,077 --> 00:09:50,744
 manner, that thereby the people might look forward on

92
00:09:50,744 --> 00:09:57,411
 the Son of God, it being a type of his order, or

93
00:09:57,411 --> 00:10:04,078
 it being his order, and this that they might look

94
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:10,745
 forward to him for a remission of their sins, that

95
00:10:10,745 --> 00:10:17,412
 they might enter into the rest of the Lord

96
00:10:17,05 --> 00:10:23,8
17 Now this Melchizedek was a king over the land

97
00:10:23,8 --> 00:10:30,55
 of Salem; and his people had waxed strong in

98
00:10:30,55 --> 00:10:37,3
 iniquity and abomination; yea, they had all gone astray;

99
00:10:37,3 --> 00:10:44,05
 they were full of all manner of wickedness

100
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:50,744
18 But Melchizedek having exercised mighty faith,

101
00:10:50,744 --> 00:10:56,744
 and received the office of the high priesthood

102
00:10:56,744 --> 00:11:02,744
 according to the holy order of God, did preach

103
00:11:02,744 --> 00:11:08,744
 repentance unto his people. And behold, they did repent;

104
00:11:08,744 --> 00:11:14,744
 and Melchizedek did establish peace in the land

105
00:11:14,744 --> 00:11:20,744
 in his days; therefore he was called the prince of

106
00:11:20,744 --> 00:11:26,744
 peace, for he was the king of Salem; and he did

107
00:11:26,744 --> 00:11:32,744
 reign under his father

108
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:37,125
19 Now, there were many before him, and also there

109
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:42,125
 were many afterwards, but none were greater;

110
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:47,125
 therefore, of him they have more particularly made

111
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:52,125
 mention

112
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:58,662
20 Now I need not rehearse the matter; what I have

113
00:11:58,662 --> 00:12:04,412
 said may suffice. Behold, the scriptures are

114
00:12:04,412 --> 00:12:10,162
 before you; if ye will wrest them it shall be to your

115
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:15,912
 own destruction

116
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:20,835
21 And now it came to pass that when Alma had said

117
00:12:20,835 --> 00:12:26,035
 these words unto them, he stretched forth his

118
00:12:26,035 --> 00:12:31,235
 hand unto them and cried with a mighty voice, saying:

119
00:12:31,235 --> 00:12:36,435
 Now is the time to repent, for the day of

120
00:12:36,435 --> 00:12:41,635
 salvation draweth nigh

121
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:48,037
22 Yea, and the voice of the Lord, by the mouth of

122
00:12:48,037 --> 00:12:54,18
 angels, doth declare it unto all nations; yea,

123
00:12:54,18 --> 00:13:00,323
 doth declare it, that they may have glad tidings of

124
00:13:00,323 --> 00:13:06,466
 great joy; yea, and he doth sound these glad

125
00:13:06,466 --> 00:13:12,609
 tidings among all his people, yea, even to them that

126
00:13:12,609 --> 00:13:18,752
 are scattered abroad upon the face of the earth;

127
00:13:18,752 --> 00:13:24,895
 wherefore they have come unto us

128
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:31,637
23 And they are made known unto us in plain terms,

129
00:13:31,637 --> 00:13:38,47
 that we may understand, that we cannot err; and

130
00:13:38,47 --> 00:13:45,303
 this because of our being wanderers in a strange

131
00:13:45,303 --> 00:13:52,136
 land; therefore, we are thus highly favored, for we

132
00:13:52,136 --> 00:13:58,969
 have these glad tidings declared unto us in all

133
00:13:58,969 --> 00:14:05,802
 parts of our vineyard

134
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:11,345
24 For behold, angels are declaring it unto many

135
00:14:11,345 --> 00:14:16,945
 at this time in our land; and this is for the

136
00:14:16,945 --> 00:14:22,545
 purpose of preparing the hearts of the children of men

137
00:14:22,545 --> 00:14:28,145
 to receive his word at the time of his coming in

138
00:14:28,145 --> 00:14:33,745
 his glory

139
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:41,873
25 And now we only wait to hear the joyful news

140
00:14:41,873 --> 00:14:49,873
 declared unto us by the mouth of angels, of his

141
00:14:49,873 --> 00:14:57,873
 coming; for the time cometh, we know not how soon.

142
00:14:57,873 --> 00:15:05,873
 Would to God that it might be in my day; but let it

143
00:15:05,873 --> 00:15:13,873
 be sooner or later, in it I will rejoice

144
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:18,112
26 And it shall be made known unto just and holy

145
00:15:18,112 --> 00:15:22,945
 men, by the mouth of angels, at the time of his

146
00:15:22,945 --> 00:15:27,778
 coming, that the words of our fathers may be

147
00:15:27,778 --> 00:15:32,611
 fulfilled, according to that which they have spoken

148
00:15:32,611 --> 00:15:37,444
 concerning him, which was according to the spirit of

149
00:15:37,444 --> 00:15:42,277
 prophecy which was in them

150
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:48,342
27 And now, my brethren, I wish from the inmost

151
00:15:48,342 --> 00:15:53,942
 part of my heart, yea, with great anxiety even unto

152
00:15:53,942 --> 00:15:59,542
 pain, that ye would hearken unto my words, and

153
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:05,142
 cast off your sins, and not procrastinate the day of

154
00:16:05,142 --> 00:16:10,742
 your repentance

155
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:17,103
28 But that ye would humble yourselves before the

156
00:16:17,103 --> 00:16:23,77
 Lord, and call on his holy name, and watch and

157
00:16:23,77 --> 00:16:30,437
 pray continually, that ye may not be tempted above

158
00:16:30,437 --> 00:16:37,104
 that which ye can bear, and thus be led by the Holy

159
00:16:37,104 --> 00:16:43,771
 Spirit, becoming humble, meek, submissive,

160
00:16:43,771 --> 00:16:50,438
 patient, full of love and all long-suffering

161
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:56,559
29 Having faith on the Lord; having a hope that ye

162
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:02,809
 shall receive eternal life; having the love of

163
00:17:02,809 --> 00:17:09,059
 God always in your hearts, that ye may be lifted up

164
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:15,309
 at the last day and enter into his rest

165
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:22,334
30 And may the Lord grant unto you repentance,

166
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:29,334
 that ye may not bring down his wrath upon you, that

167
00:17:29,334 --> 00:17:36,334
 ye may not be bound down by the chains of hell,

168
00:17:36,334 --> 00:17:43,334
 that ye may not suffer the second death

169
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:49,262
31 And Alma spake many more words unto the people,

170
00:17:49,262 --> 00:17:55,262
 which are not written in this book.
