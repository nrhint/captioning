00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:09,333
Chapter 6 The Church in Zarahemla is cleansed and

2
00:00:09,333 --> 00:00:18,666
 set in order—Alma goes to Gideon to preach. About

3
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:27,999
 83 B.C.

4
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:30,962
1 And now it came to pass that after Alma had made

5
00:00:30,962 --> 00:00:33,629
 an end of speaking unto the people of the church,

6
00:00:33,629 --> 00:00:36,296
 which was established in the city of Zarahemla,

7
00:00:36,296 --> 00:00:38,963
 he ordained priests and elders, by laying on his

8
00:00:38,963 --> 00:00:41,63
 hands according to the order of God, to preside and

9
00:00:41,63 --> 00:00:44,297
 watch over the church

10
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:53,244
2 And it came to pass that whosoever did not

11
00:00:53,244 --> 00:01:02,244
 belong to the church who repented of their sins were

12
00:01:02,244 --> 00:01:11,244
 baptized unto repentance, and were received into the

13
00:01:11,244 --> 00:01:20,244
 church

14
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:25,642
3 And it also came to pass that whosoever did

15
00:01:25,642 --> 00:01:31,071
 belong to the church that did not repent of their

16
00:01:31,071 --> 00:01:36,5
 wickedness and humble themselves before God—I mean

17
00:01:36,5 --> 00:01:41,929
 those who were lifted up in the pride of their

18
00:01:41,929 --> 00:01:47,358
 hearts—the same were rejected, and their names were

19
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:52,787
 blotted out, that their names were not numbered among

20
00:01:52,787 --> 00:01:58,216
 those of the righteous

21
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:03,918
4 And thus they began to establish the order of

22
00:02:03,918 --> 00:02:09,418
 the church in the city of Zarahemla

23
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:13,963
5 Now I would that ye should understand that the

24
00:02:13,963 --> 00:02:18,463
 word of God was liberal unto all, that none were

25
00:02:18,463 --> 00:02:22,963
 deprived of the privilege of assembling themselves

26
00:02:22,963 --> 00:02:27,463
 together to hear the word of God

27
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:32,448
6 Nevertheless the children of God were commanded

28
00:02:32,448 --> 00:02:37,248
 that they should gather themselves together oft,

29
00:02:37,248 --> 00:02:42,048
 and join in fasting and mighty prayer in behalf of

30
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:46,847
 the welfare of the souls of those who knew not

31
00:02:46,847 --> 00:02:51,648
 God

32
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:57,416
7 And now it came to pass that when Alma had made

33
00:02:57,416 --> 00:03:03,194
 these regulations he departed from them, yea, from

34
00:03:03,194 --> 00:03:08,972
 the church which was in the city of Zarahemla,

35
00:03:08,972 --> 00:03:14,75
 and went over upon the east of the river Sidon, into

36
00:03:14,75 --> 00:03:20,528
 the valley of Gideon, there having been a city

37
00:03:20,528 --> 00:03:26,306
 built, which was called the city of Gideon, which

38
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:32,084
 was in the valley that was called Gideon, being

39
00:03:32,084 --> 00:03:37,862
 called after the man who was slain by the hand of

40
00:03:37,862 --> 00:03:43,64
 Nehor with the sword

41
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:48,656
8 And Alma went and began to declare the word of

42
00:03:48,656 --> 00:03:53,956
 God unto the church which was established in the

43
00:03:53,956 --> 00:03:59,256
 valley of Gideon, according to the revelation of the

44
00:03:59,256 --> 00:04:04,556
 truth of the word which had been spoken by his

45
00:04:04,556 --> 00:04:09,856
 fathers, and according to the spirit of prophecy

46
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:15,156
 which was in him, according to the testimony of Jesus

47
00:04:15,156 --> 00:04:20,456
 Christ, the Son of God, who should come to redeem

48
00:04:20,456 --> 00:04:25,756
 his people from their sins, and the holy order by

49
00:04:25,756 --> 00:04:31,056
 which he was called. And thus it is written.

50
00:04:31,056 --> 00:04:36,356
 Amen.
