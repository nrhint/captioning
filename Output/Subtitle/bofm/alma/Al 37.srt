00:00:00,0 --> 00:01:28,625
Chapter 37 The plates of brass and other

2
00:01:28,625 --> 00:02:57,25
 scriptures are preserved to bring souls to salvation—The

3
00:02:57,25 --> 00:04:25,875
 Jaredites were destroyed because of their

4
00:04:25,875 --> 00:05:54,5
 wickedness—Their secret oaths and covenants must be kept

5
00:05:54,5 --> 00:07:23,125
 from the people—Counsel with the Lord in all your

6
00:07:23,125 --> 00:08:51,75
 doings—As the Liahona guided the Nephites, so the

7
00:08:51,75 --> 00:10:20,375
 word of Christ leads men to eternal life. About

00:10:20,375 --> 00:11:49,0
 74 B.C.

9
00:11:49,743 --> 00:11:55,076
1 And now, my son Helaman, I command you that ye

10
00:11:55,076 --> 00:12:00,409
 take the records which have been entrusted with me

11
00:12:00,409 --> 00:12:05,742


12
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:12,092
2 And I also command you that ye keep a record of

13
00:12:12,092 --> 00:12:18,492
 this people, according as I have done, upon the

14
00:12:18,492 --> 00:12:24,892
 plates of Nephi, and keep all these things sacred

15
00:12:24,892 --> 00:12:31,292
 which I have kept, even as I have kept them; for it

16
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:37,692
 is for a wise purpose that they are kept

17
00:12:37,591 --> 00:13:47,341
3 And these plates of brass, which contain these

18
00:13:47,341 --> 00:14:57,091
 engravings, which have the records of the holy

19
00:14:57,091 --> 00:16:06,841
 scriptures upon them, which have the genealogy of our

20
00:16:06,841 --> 00:17:16,591
 forefathers, even from the beginning

21
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:23,56
4 Behold, it has been prophesied by our fathers,

22
00:17:23,56 --> 00:17:30,417
 that they should be kept and handed down from one

23
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:37,274
 generation to another, and be kept and preserved by

24
00:17:37,274 --> 00:17:44,131
 the hand of the Lord until they should go forth

25
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:50,988
 unto every nation, kindred, tongue, and people,

26
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:57,845
 that they shall know of the mysteries contained

27
00:17:57,845 --> 00:18:04,702
 thereon

28
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:08,551
5 And now behold, if they are kept they must

29
00:18:08,551 --> 00:18:12,551
 retain their brightness; yea, and they will retain

30
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:16,551
 their brightness; yea, and also shall all the plates

31
00:18:16,551 --> 00:18:20,551
 which do contain that which is holy writ

32
00:18:20,501 --> 00:18:38,101
6 Now ye may suppose that this is foolishness in

33
00:18:38,101 --> 00:18:55,701
 me; but behold I say unto you, that by small and

34
00:18:55,701 --> 00:19:13,301
 simple things are great things brought to pass; and

35
00:19:13,301 --> 00:19:30,901
 small means in many instances doth confound the

36
00:19:30,901 --> 00:19:48,501
 wise

37
00:19:48,222 --> 00:20:02,222
7 And the Lord God doth work by means to bring

38
00:20:02,222 --> 00:20:16,222
 about his great and eternal purposes; and by very

39
00:20:16,222 --> 00:20:30,222
 small means the Lord doth confound the wise and

40
00:20:30,222 --> 00:20:44,222
 bringeth about the salvation of many souls

41
00:20:44,044 --> 00:20:49,211
8 And now, it has hitherto been wisdom in God that

42
00:20:49,211 --> 00:20:54,378
 these things should be preserved; for behold,

43
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:59,545
 they have enlarged the memory of this people, yea,

44
00:20:59,545 --> 00:21:04,712
 and convinced many of the error of their ways, and

45
00:21:04,712 --> 00:21:09,879
 brought them to the knowledge of their God unto the

46
00:21:09,879 --> 00:21:15,046
 salvation of their souls

47
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:17,721
9 Yea, I say unto you, were it not for these

48
00:21:17,721 --> 00:21:19,499
 things that these records do contain, which are on

49
00:21:19,499 --> 00:21:21,277
 these plates, Ammon and his brethren could not have

50
00:21:21,277 --> 00:21:23,055
 convinced so many thousands of the Lamanites of the

51
00:21:23,055 --> 00:21:24,833
 incorrect tradition of their fathers; yea, these

52
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,611
 records and their words brought them unto

53
00:21:26,611 --> 00:21:28,389
 repentance; that is, they brought them to the knowledge of

54
00:21:28,389 --> 00:21:30,167
 the Lord their God, and to rejoice in Jesus Christ

55
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:31,945
 their Redeemer

56
00:21:31,892 --> 00:21:33,225
10 And who knoweth but what they will be the means

57
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:34,558
 of bringing many thousands of them, yea, and also

58
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:35,891
 many thousands of our stiffnecked brethren, the

59
00:21:35,891 --> 00:21:37,224
 Nephites, who are now hardening their hearts in sin

60
00:21:37,224 --> 00:21:38,557
 and iniquities, to the knowledge of their

61
00:21:38,557 --> 00:21:39,89
 Redeemer

62
00:21:39,867 --> 00:21:51,867
11 Now these mysteries are not yet fully made

63
00:21:51,867 --> 00:22:03,867
 known unto me; therefore I shall forbear

64
00:22:03,79 --> 00:22:16,59
12 And it may suffice if I only say they are

65
00:22:16,59 --> 00:22:29,39
 preserved for a wise purpose, which purpose is known

66
00:22:29,39 --> 00:22:42,19
 unto God; for he doth counsel in wisdom over all his

67
00:22:42,19 --> 00:22:54,99
 works, and his paths are straight, and his course

68
00:22:54,99 --> 00:23:07,79
 is one eternal round

69
00:23:07,588 --> 00:23:17,188
13 O remember, remember, my son Helaman, how

70
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:26,788
 strict are the commandments of God. And he said: If ye

71
00:23:26,788 --> 00:23:36,388
 will keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the

72
00:23:36,388 --> 00:23:45,988
 land—but if ye keep not his commandments ye shall

73
00:23:45,988 --> 00:23:55,588
 be cut off from his presence

74
00:23:55,435 --> 00:24:13,035
14 And now remember, my son, that God has

75
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:30,635
 entrusted you with these things, which are sacred, which

76
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:48,235
 he has kept sacred, and also which he will keep and

77
00:24:48,235 --> 00:25:05,835
 preserve for a wise purpose in him, that he may

78
00:25:05,835 --> 00:25:23,435
 show forth his power unto future generations

79
00:25:23,156 --> 00:25:25,823
15 And now behold, I tell you by the spirit of

80
00:25:25,823 --> 00:25:28,49
 prophecy, that if ye transgress the commandments of

81
00:25:28,49 --> 00:25:31,157
 God, behold, these things which are sacred shall be

82
00:25:31,157 --> 00:25:33,824
 taken away from you by the power of God, and ye

83
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:36,491
 shall be delivered up unto Satan, that he may sift

84
00:25:36,491 --> 00:25:39,158
 you as chaff before the wind

85
00:11:49,743 --> 00:11:53,743
18 For he promised unto them that he would

86
00:11:53,743 --> 00:11:57,743
 preserve these things for a wise purpose in him, that he

87
00:11:57,743 --> 00:12:01,743
 might show forth his power unto future

88
00:12:01,743 --> 00:12:05,743
 generations

89
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:11,025
19 And now behold, one purpose hath he fulfilled,

90
00:12:11,025 --> 00:12:16,358
 even to the restoration of many thousands of the

91
00:12:16,358 --> 00:12:21,691
 Lamanites to the knowledge of the truth; and he

92
00:12:21,691 --> 00:12:27,024
 hath shown forth his power in them, and he will also

93
00:12:27,024 --> 00:12:32,357
 still show forth his power in them unto future

94
00:12:32,357 --> 00:12:37,69
 generations; therefore they shall be preserved

95
00:12:37,591 --> 00:13:47,341
20 Therefore I command you, my son Helaman, that

96
00:13:47,341 --> 00:14:57,091
 ye be diligent in fulfilling all my words, and that

97
00:14:57,091 --> 00:16:06,841
 ye be diligent in keeping the commandments of God

98
00:16:06,841 --> 00:17:16,591
 as they are written

99
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:22,036
21 And now, I will speak unto you concerning those

100
00:17:22,036 --> 00:17:27,369
 twenty-four plates, that ye keep them, that the

101
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:32,702
 mysteries and the works of darkness, and their

102
00:17:32,702 --> 00:17:38,035
 secret works, or the secret works of those people who

103
00:17:38,035 --> 00:17:43,368
 have been destroyed, may be made manifest unto

104
00:17:43,368 --> 00:17:48,701
 this people; yea, all their murders, and robbings,

105
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:54,034
 and their plunderings, and all their wickedness and

106
00:17:54,034 --> 00:17:59,367
 abominations, may be made manifest unto this

107
00:17:59,367 --> 00:18:04,7
 people; yea, and that ye preserve these interpreters

108
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:07,751
22 For behold, the Lord saw that his people began

109
00:18:07,751 --> 00:18:10,951
 to work in darkness, yea, work secret murders and

110
00:18:10,951 --> 00:18:14,151
 abominations; therefore the Lord said, if they did

111
00:18:14,151 --> 00:18:17,351
 not repent they should be destroyed from off the

112
00:18:17,351 --> 00:18:20,551
 face of the earth

113
00:18:20,501 --> 00:18:33,072
23 And the Lord said: I will prepare unto my

114
00:18:33,072 --> 00:18:45,643
 servant Gazelem, a stone, which shall shine forth in

115
00:18:45,643 --> 00:18:58,214
 darkness unto light, that I may discover unto my

116
00:18:58,214 --> 00:19:10,785
 people who serve me, that I may discover unto them

117
00:19:10,785 --> 00:19:23,356
 the works of their brethren, yea, their secret

118
00:19:23,356 --> 00:19:35,927
 works, their works of darkness, and their wickedness

119
00:19:35,927 --> 00:19:48,498
 and abominations

120
00:19:48,222 --> 00:20:06,889
24 And now, my son, these interpreters were

121
00:20:06,889 --> 00:20:25,556
 prepared that the word of God might be fulfilled, which

122
00:20:25,556 --> 00:20:44,223
 he spake, saying

123
00:20:44,044 --> 00:20:49,211
25 I will bring forth out of darkness unto light

124
00:20:49,211 --> 00:20:54,378
 all their secret works and their abominations; and

125
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:59,545
 except they repent I will destroy them from off

126
00:20:59,545 --> 00:21:04,712
 the face of the earth; and I will bring to light all

127
00:21:04,712 --> 00:21:09,879
 their secrets and abominations, unto every nation

128
00:21:09,879 --> 00:21:15,046
 that shall hereafter possess the land

129
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:19,143
26 And now, my son, we see that they did not

130
00:21:19,143 --> 00:21:22,343
 repent; therefore they have been destroyed, and thus

131
00:21:22,343 --> 00:21:25,543
 far the word of God has been fulfilled; yea, their

132
00:21:25,543 --> 00:21:28,743
 secret abominations have been brought out of

133
00:21:28,743 --> 00:21:31,943
 darkness and made known unto us

134
00:21:31,892 --> 00:21:33,035
27 And now, my son, I command you that ye retain

135
00:21:33,035 --> 00:21:34,178
 all their oaths, and their covenants, and their

136
00:21:34,178 --> 00:21:35,321
 agreements in their secret abominations; yea, and all

137
00:21:35,321 --> 00:21:36,464
 their signs and their wonders ye shall keep from

138
00:21:36,464 --> 00:21:37,607
 this people, that they know them not, lest

139
00:21:37,607 --> 00:21:38,75
 peradventure they should fall into darkness also and be

140
00:21:38,75 --> 00:21:39,893
 destroyed

141
00:21:39,867 --> 00:21:44,667
28 For behold, there is a curse upon all this

142
00:21:44,667 --> 00:21:49,467
 land, that destruction shall come upon all those

143
00:21:49,467 --> 00:21:54,267
 workers of darkness, according to the power of God,

144
00:21:54,267 --> 00:21:59,067
 when they are fully ripe; therefore I desire that

145
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:03,867
 this people might not be destroyed

146
00:22:03,79 --> 00:22:10,901
29 Therefore ye shall keep these secret plans of

147
00:22:10,901 --> 00:22:18,012
 their oaths and their covenants from this people,

148
00:22:18,012 --> 00:22:25,123
 and only their wickedness and their murders and

149
00:22:25,123 --> 00:22:32,234
 their abominations shall ye make known unto them; and

150
00:22:32,234 --> 00:22:39,345
 ye shall teach them to abhor such wickedness and

151
00:22:39,345 --> 00:22:46,456
 abominations and murders; and ye shall also teach

152
00:22:46,456 --> 00:22:53,567
 them that these people were destroyed on account

153
00:22:53,567 --> 00:23:00,678
 of their wickedness and abominations and their

154
00:23:00,678 --> 00:23:07,789
 murders

155
00:23:07,588 --> 00:23:14,445
30 For behold, they murdered all the prophets of

156
00:23:14,445 --> 00:23:21,302
 the Lord who came among them to declare unto them

157
00:23:21,302 --> 00:23:28,159
 concerning their iniquities; and the blood of those

158
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:35,016
 whom they murdered did cry unto the Lord their

159
00:23:35,016 --> 00:23:41,873
 God for vengeance upon those who were their

160
00:23:41,873 --> 00:23:48,73
 murderers; and thus the judgments of God did come upon

161
00:23:48,73 --> 00:23:55,587
 these workers of darkness and secret combinations

162
00:23:55,435 --> 00:24:17,435
31 Yea, and cursed be the land forever and ever

163
00:24:17,435 --> 00:24:39,435
 unto those workers of darkness and secret

164
00:24:39,435 --> 00:25:01,435
 combinations, even unto destruction, except they repent

165
00:25:01,435 --> 00:25:23,435
 before they are fully ripe

166
00:25:23,156 --> 00:25:27,156
32 And now, my son, remember the words which I

167
00:25:27,156 --> 00:25:31,156
 have spoken unto you; trust not those secret plans

168
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:35,156
 unto this people, but teach them an everlasting

169
00:25:35,156 --> 00:25:39,156
 hatred against sin and iniquity

170
00:11:49,743 --> 00:11:55,076
35 O, remember, my son, and learn wisdom in thy

171
00:11:55,076 --> 00:12:00,409
 youth; yea, learn in thy youth to keep the

172
00:12:00,409 --> 00:12:05,742
 commandments of God

173
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:11,025
36 Yea, and cry unto God for all thy support; yea,

174
00:12:11,025 --> 00:12:16,358
 let all thy doings be unto the Lord, and

175
00:12:16,358 --> 00:12:21,691
 whithersoever thou goest let it be in the Lord; yea, let

176
00:12:21,691 --> 00:12:27,024
 all thy thoughts be directed unto the Lord; yea,

177
00:12:27,024 --> 00:12:32,357
 let the affections of thy heart be placed upon the

178
00:12:32,357 --> 00:12:37,69
 Lord forever

179
00:12:37,591 --> 00:13:17,448
37 Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he

180
00:13:17,448 --> 00:13:57,305
 will direct thee for good; yea, when thou liest

181
00:13:57,305 --> 00:14:37,162
 down at night lie down unto the Lord, that he may

182
00:14:37,162 --> 00:15:17,019
 watch over you in your sleep; and when thou risest

183
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:56,876
 in the morning let thy heart be full of thanks

184
00:15:56,876 --> 00:16:36,733
 unto God; and if ye do these things, ye shall be

185
00:16:36,733 --> 00:17:16,59
 lifted up at the last day

186
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:26,303
38 And now, my son, I have somewhat to say

187
00:17:26,303 --> 00:17:35,903
 concerning the thing which our fathers call a ball, or

188
00:17:35,903 --> 00:17:45,503
 director—or our fathers called it Liahona, which is,

189
00:17:45,503 --> 00:17:55,103
 being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord

190
00:17:55,103 --> 00:18:04,703
 prepared it

191
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:08,551
39 And behold, there cannot any man work after the

192
00:18:08,551 --> 00:18:12,551
 manner of so curious a workmanship. And behold,

193
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:16,551
 it was prepared to show unto our fathers the course

194
00:18:16,551 --> 00:18:20,551
 which they should travel in the wilderness

195
00:18:20,501 --> 00:18:33,072
40 And it did work for them according to their

196
00:18:33,072 --> 00:18:45,643
 faith in God; therefore, if they had faith to believe

197
00:18:45,643 --> 00:18:58,214
 that God could cause that those spindles should

198
00:18:58,214 --> 00:19:10,785
 point the way they should go, behold, it was done;

199
00:19:10,785 --> 00:19:23,356
 therefore they had this miracle, and also many

200
00:19:23,356 --> 00:19:35,927
 other miracles wrought by the power of God, day by

201
00:19:35,927 --> 00:19:48,498
 day

202
00:19:48,222 --> 00:19:57,555
41 Nevertheless, because those miracles were

203
00:19:57,555 --> 00:20:06,888
 worked by small means it did show unto them marvelous

204
00:20:06,888 --> 00:20:16,221
 works. They were slothful, and forgot to exercise

205
00:20:16,221 --> 00:20:25,554
 their faith and diligence and then those marvelous

206
00:20:25,554 --> 00:20:34,887
 works ceased, and they did not progress in their

207
00:20:34,887 --> 00:20:44,22
 journey

208
00:20:44,044 --> 00:20:51,794
42 Therefore, they tarried in the wilderness, or

209
00:20:51,794 --> 00:20:59,544
 did not travel a direct course, and were afflicted

210
00:20:59,544 --> 00:21:07,294
 with hunger and thirst, because of their

211
00:21:07,294 --> 00:21:15,044
 transgressions

212
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:18,61
43 And now, my son, I would that ye should

213
00:21:18,61 --> 00:21:21,277
 understand that these things are not without a shadow;

214
00:21:21,277 --> 00:21:23,944
 for as our fathers were slothful to give heed to

215
00:21:23,944 --> 00:21:26,611
 this compass (now these things were temporal) they

216
00:21:26,611 --> 00:21:29,278
 did not prosper; even so it is with things which are

217
00:21:29,278 --> 00:21:31,945
 spiritual

218
00:21:31,892 --> 00:21:33,492
44 For behold, it is as easy to give heed to the

219
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:35,092
 word of Christ, which will point to you a straight

220
00:21:35,092 --> 00:21:36,692
 course to eternal bliss, as it was for our fathers

221
00:21:36,692 --> 00:21:38,292
 to give heed to this compass, which would point

222
00:21:38,292 --> 00:21:39,892
 unto them a straight course to the promised land

223
00:21:39,867 --> 00:21:43,867
45 And now I say, is there not a type in this

224
00:21:43,867 --> 00:21:47,867
 thing? For just as surely as this director did bring

225
00:21:47,867 --> 00:21:51,867
 our fathers, by following its course, to the

226
00:21:51,867 --> 00:21:55,867
 promised land, shall the words of Christ, if we follow

227
00:21:55,867 --> 00:21:59,867
 their course, carry us beyond this vale of sorrow

228
00:21:59,867 --> 00:22:03,867
 into a far better land of promise

229
00:22:03,79 --> 00:22:14,457
46 O my son, do not let us be slothful because of

230
00:22:14,457 --> 00:22:25,124
 the easiness of the way; for so was it with our

231
00:22:25,124 --> 00:22:35,791
 fathers; for so was it prepared for them, that if

232
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:46,458
 they would look they might live; even so it is with

233
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:57,125
 us. The way is prepared, and if we will look we

234
00:22:57,125 --> 00:23:07,792
 may live forever

235
00:23:07,588 --> 00:23:07,588
47 And now, my son, see that ye take care of these

236
00:23:07,588 --> 00:23:07,588
 sacred things, yea, see that ye look to God and

237
00:23:07,588 --> 00:23:07,588
 live. Go unto this people and declare the word, and

238
00:23:07,588 --> 00:23:07,588
 be sober. My son, farewell.
