1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:04,875
The commandments of Alma to his son Helaman.

2
00:00:04,875 --> 00:00:09,75
 Comprising chapters 36 and 37.Chapter 36 Alma testifies

3
00:00:09,75 --> 00:00:14,625
 to Helaman of his conversion after seeing an

4
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:19,5
 angel—He suffered the pains of a damned soul; he

5
00:00:19,5 --> 00:00:24,375
 called upon the name of Jesus, and was then born of

6
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:29,25
 God—Sweet joy filled his soul—He saw concourses of

7
00:00:29,25 --> 00:00:34,125
 angels praising God—Many converts have tasted and

8
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:39,0
 seen as he has tasted and seen. About 74 B.C.

9
00:00:39,873 --> 00:01:03,873
1 My son, give ear to my words; for I swear unto

10
00:01:03,873 --> 00:01:27,873
 you, that inasmuch as ye shall keep the

11
00:01:27,873 --> 00:01:51,873
 commandments of God ye shall prosper in the land

12
00:01:51,178 --> 00:02:02,345
2 I would that ye should do as I have done, in

13
00:02:02,345 --> 00:02:13,512
 remembering the captivity of our fathers; for they

14
00:02:13,512 --> 00:02:24,679
 were in bondage, and none could deliver them except

15
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:35,846
 it was the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac,

16
00:02:35,846 --> 00:02:47,013
 and the God of Jacob; and he surely did deliver

17
00:02:47,013 --> 00:02:58,18
 them in their afflictions

18
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,011
3 And now, O my son Helaman, behold, thou art in

19
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:02,011
 thy youth, and therefore, I beseech of thee that

20
00:03:02,011 --> 00:03:04,011
 thou wilt hear my words and learn of me; for I do

21
00:03:04,011 --> 00:03:06,011
 know that whosoever shall put their trust in God

22
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:08,011
 shall be supported in their trials, and their

23
00:03:08,011 --> 00:03:10,011
 troubles, and their afflictions, and shall be lifted up

24
00:03:10,011 --> 00:03:12,011
 at the last day

25
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:28,493
4 And I would not that ye think that I know of

26
00:03:28,493 --> 00:03:44,16
 myself—not of the temporal but of the spiritual, not

27
00:03:44,16 --> 00:03:59,827
 of the carnal mind but of God

28
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:36,106
5 Now, behold, I say unto you, if I had not been

29
00:04:36,106 --> 00:05:12,706
 born of God I should not have known these things;

30
00:05:12,706 --> 00:05:49,306
 but God has, by the mouth of his holy angel, made

31
00:05:49,306 --> 00:06:25,906
 these things known unto me, not of any worthiness

32
00:06:25,906 --> 00:07:02,506
 of myself

33
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:48,255
6 For I went about with the sons of Mosiah,

34
00:07:48,255 --> 00:08:33,589
 seeking to destroy the church of God; but behold, God

35
00:08:33,589 --> 00:09:18,922
 sent his holy angel to stop us by the way

36
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:28,491
7 And behold, he spake unto us, as it were the

37
00:09:28,491 --> 00:09:38,491
 voice of thunder, and the whole earth did tremble

38
00:09:38,491 --> 00:09:48,491
 beneath our feet; and we all fell to the earth, for

39
00:09:48,491 --> 00:09:58,491
 the fear of the Lord came upon us

40
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:06,364
8 But behold, the voice said unto me: Arise. And I

41
00:10:06,364 --> 00:10:14,364
 arose and stood up, and beheld the angel

42
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:16,981
9 And he said unto me: If thou wilt of thyself be

43
00:10:16,981 --> 00:10:19,648
 destroyed, seek no more to destroy the church of

44
00:10:19,648 --> 00:10:22,315
 God

45
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:52,038
10 And it came to pass that I fell to the earth;

46
00:10:52,038 --> 00:11:21,788
 and it was for the space of three days and three

47
00:11:21,788 --> 00:11:51,538
 nights that I could not open my mouth, neither had I

48
00:11:51,538 --> 00:12:21,288
 the use of my limbs

49
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:36,765
11 And the angel spake more things unto me, which

50
00:12:36,765 --> 00:12:51,622
 were heard by my brethren, but I did not hear

51
00:12:51,622 --> 00:13:06,479
 them; for when I heard the words—If thou wilt be

52
00:13:06,479 --> 00:13:21,336
 destroyed of thyself, seek no more to destroy the

53
00:13:21,336 --> 00:13:36,193
 church of God—I was struck with such great fear and

54
00:13:36,193 --> 00:13:51,05
 amazement lest perhaps I should be destroyed, that I

55
00:13:51,05 --> 00:14:05,907
 fell to the earth and I did hear no more

56
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:40,245
12 But I was racked with eternal torment, for my

57
00:14:40,245 --> 00:15:14,912
 soul was harrowed up to the greatest degree and

58
00:15:14,912 --> 00:15:49,579
 racked with all my sins

59
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:55,248
13 Yea, I did remember all my sins and iniquities,

60
00:15:55,248 --> 00:16:01,248
 for which I was tormented with the pains of hell;

61
00:16:01,248 --> 00:16:07,248
 yea, I saw that I had rebelled against my God,

62
00:16:07,248 --> 00:16:13,248
 and that I had not kept his holy commandments

63
00:00:39,873 --> 00:01:15,873
16 And now, for three days and for three nights

64
00:01:15,873 --> 00:01:51,873
 was I racked, even with the pains of a damned soul

65
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:55,645
17 And it came to pass that as I was thus racked

66
00:01:55,645 --> 00:01:59,645
 with torment, while I was harrowed up by the memory

67
00:01:59,645 --> 00:02:03,645
 of my many sins, behold, I remembered also to

68
00:02:03,645 --> 00:02:07,645
 have heard my father prophesy unto the people

69
00:02:07,645 --> 00:02:11,645
 concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God,

70
00:02:11,645 --> 00:02:15,645
 to atone for the sins of the world

71
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:18,769
18 Now, as my mind caught hold upon this thought,

72
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:21,969
 I cried within my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God,

73
00:02:21,969 --> 00:02:25,169
 have mercy on me, who am in the gall of

74
00:02:25,169 --> 00:02:28,369
 bitterness, and am encircled about by the everlasting

75
00:02:28,369 --> 00:02:31,569
 chains of death

76
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:36,851
19 And now, behold, when I thought this, I could

77
00:02:36,851 --> 00:02:42,184
 remember my pains no more; yea, I was harrowed up

78
00:02:42,184 --> 00:02:47,517
 by the memory of my sins no more

79
00:02:47,467 --> 00:03:08,8
20 And oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I

80
00:03:08,8 --> 00:03:30,133
 did behold; yea, my soul was filled with joy as

81
00:03:30,133 --> 00:03:51,466
 exceeding as was my pain

82
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:57,664
21 Yea, I say unto you, my son, that there could

83
00:03:57,664 --> 00:04:04,064
 be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were my

84
00:04:04,064 --> 00:04:10,464
 pains. Yea, and again I say unto you, my son, that

85
00:04:10,464 --> 00:04:16,864
 on the other hand, there can be nothing so

86
00:04:16,864 --> 00:04:23,264
 exquisite and sweet as was my joy

87
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:42,163
22 Yea, methought I saw, even as our father Lehi

88
00:04:42,163 --> 00:05:01,163
 saw, God sitting upon his throne, surrounded with

89
00:05:01,163 --> 00:05:20,163
 numberless concourses of angels, in the attitude of

90
00:05:20,163 --> 00:05:39,163
 singing and praising their God; yea, and my soul

91
00:05:39,163 --> 00:05:58,163
 did long to be there

92
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:14,858
23 But behold, my limbs did receive their strength

93
00:06:14,858 --> 00:06:30,858
 again, and I stood upon my feet, and did manifest

94
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:46,858
 unto the people that I had been born of God

95
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:53,373
24 Yea, and from that time even until now, I have

96
00:06:53,373 --> 00:07:00,04
 labored without ceasing, that I might bring souls

97
00:07:00,04 --> 00:07:06,707
 unto repentance; that I might bring them to taste

98
00:07:06,707 --> 00:07:13,374
 of the exceeding joy of which I did taste; that

99
00:07:13,374 --> 00:07:20,041
 they might also be born of God, and be filled with

100
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:26,708
 the Holy Ghost

101
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:58,579
25 Yea, and now behold, O my son, the Lord doth

102
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:30,579
 give me exceedingly great joy in the fruit of my

103
00:08:30,579 --> 00:09:02,579
 labors

104
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:26,108
26 For because of the word which he has imparted

105
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:49,941
 unto me, behold, many have been born of God, and

106
00:09:49,941 --> 00:10:13,774
 have tasted as I have tasted, and have seen eye to

107
00:10:13,774 --> 00:10:37,607
 eye as I have seen; therefore they do know of these

108
00:10:37,607 --> 00:11:01,44
 things of which I have spoken, as I do know; and

109
00:11:01,44 --> 00:11:25,273
 the knowledge which I have is of God

110
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:45,018
27 And I have been supported under trials and

111
00:11:45,018 --> 00:12:04,218
 troubles of every kind, yea, and in all manner of

112
00:12:04,218 --> 00:12:23,418
 afflictions; yea, God has delivered me from prison,

113
00:12:23,418 --> 00:12:42,618
 and from bonds, and from death; yea, and I do put my

114
00:12:42,618 --> 00:13:01,818
 trust in him, and he will still deliver me

115
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:20,639
28 And I know that he will raise me up at the last

116
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:39,764
 day, to dwell with him in glory; yea, and I will

117
00:13:39,764 --> 00:13:58,889
 praise him forever, for he has brought our fathers

118
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:18,014
 out of Egypt, and he has swallowed up the

119
00:14:18,014 --> 00:14:37,139
 Egyptians in the Red Sea; and he led them by his power

120
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:56,264
 into the promised land; yea, and he has delivered

121
00:14:56,264 --> 00:15:15,389
 them out of bondage and captivity from time to time

122
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:34,514


123
00:15:34,5 --> 00:15:36,75
29 Yea, and he has also brought our fathers out of

124
00:15:36,75 --> 00:15:39,0
 the land of Jerusalem; and he has also, by his

125
00:15:39,0 --> 00:15:41,25
 everlasting power, delivered them out of bondage and

126
00:15:41,25 --> 00:15:43,5
 captivity, from time to time even down to the

127
00:15:43,5 --> 00:15:45,75
 present day; and I have always retained in

128
00:15:45,75 --> 00:15:48,0
 remembrance their captivity; yea, and ye also ought to

129
00:15:48,0 --> 00:15:50,25
 retain in remembrance, as I have done, their captivity

130
00:15:50,25 --> 00:15:52,5


131
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:52,018
30 But behold, my son, this is not all; for ye

132
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:52,018
 ought to know as I do know, that inasmuch as ye shall

133
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:52,018
 keep the commandments of God ye shall prosper in

134
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:52,018
 the land; and ye ought to know also, that inasmuch

135
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:52,018
 as ye will not keep the commandments of God ye

136
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:52,018
 shall be cut off from his presence. Now this is

137
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:52,018
 according to his word.
