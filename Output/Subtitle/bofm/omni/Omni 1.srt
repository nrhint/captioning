00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:10,889
The Book of OmniChapter 1 Omni, Amaron, Chemish,

2
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:21,778
 Abinadom, and Amaleki, each in turn, keep the

3
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:32,667
 records—Mosiah discovers the people of Zarahemla, who

4
00:00:32,667 --> 00:00:43,556
 came from Jerusalem in the days of Zedekiah—Mosiah

5
00:00:43,556 --> 00:00:54,445
 is made king over them—The descendants of Mulek at

6
00:00:54,445 --> 00:01:05,334
 Zarahemla had discovered Coriantumr, the last of

7
00:01:05,334 --> 00:01:16,223
 the Jaredites—King Benjamin succeeds Mosiah—Men

8
00:01:16,223 --> 00:01:27,112
 should offer their souls as an offering to Christ.

9
00:01:27,112 --> 00:01:38,001
 About 323–130 B.C.

10
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:43,282
1 Behold, it came to pass that I, Omni, being

11
00:01:43,282 --> 00:01:48,032
 commanded by my father, Jarom, that I should write

12
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:52,782
 somewhat upon these plates, to preserve our

13
00:01:52,782 --> 00:01:57,532
 genealogy

14
00:01:57,184 --> 00:02:07,041
2 Wherefore, in my days, I would that ye should

15
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:16,898
 know that I fought much with the sword to preserve

16
00:02:16,898 --> 00:02:26,755
 my people, the Nephites, from falling into the

17
00:02:26,755 --> 00:02:36,612
 hands of their enemies, the Lamanites. But behold, I

18
00:02:36,612 --> 00:02:46,469
 of myself am a wicked man, and I have not kept the

19
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:56,326
 statutes and the commandments of the Lord as I

20
00:02:56,326 --> 00:03:06,183
 ought to have done

21
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:13,353
3 And it came to pass that two hundred and seventy

22
00:03:13,353 --> 00:03:20,353
 and six years had passed away, and we had many

23
00:03:20,353 --> 00:03:27,353
 seasons of peace; and we had many seasons of serious

24
00:03:27,353 --> 00:03:34,353
 war and bloodshed. Yea, and in fine, two hundred

25
00:03:34,353 --> 00:03:41,353
 and eighty and two years had passed away, and I

26
00:03:41,353 --> 00:03:48,353
 had kept these plates according to the commandments

27
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:55,353
 of my fathers; and I conferred them upon my son

28
00:03:55,353 --> 00:04:02,353
 Amaron. And I make an end

29
00:04:02,175 --> 00:06:25,675
4 And now I, Amaron, write the things whatsoever I

30
00:06:25,675 --> 00:08:49,175
 write, which are few, in the book of my father

31
00:08:49,262 --> 00:09:13,262
5 Behold, it came to pass that three hundred and

32
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:37,262
 twenty years had passed away, and the more wicked

33
00:09:37,262 --> 00:10:01,262
 part of the Nephites were destroyed

34
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:04,32
6 For the Lord would not suffer, after he had led

35
00:10:04,32 --> 00:10:07,606
 them out of the land of Jerusalem and kept and

36
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:10,892
 preserved them from falling into the hands of their

37
00:10:10,892 --> 00:10:14,178
 enemies, yea, he would not suffer that the words

38
00:10:14,178 --> 00:10:17,464
 should not be verified, which he spake unto our

39
00:10:17,464 --> 00:10:20,75
 fathers, saying that: Inasmuch as ye will not keep my

40
00:10:20,75 --> 00:10:24,036
 commandments ye shall not prosper in the land

41
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:32,958
7 Wherefore, the Lord did visit them in great

42
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:40,958
 judgment; nevertheless, he did spare the righteous

43
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:48,958
 that they should not perish, but did deliver them out

44
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:56,958
 of the hands of their enemies

45
00:10:56,856 --> 00:12:00,856
8 And it came to pass that I did deliver the

46
00:12:00,856 --> 00:13:04,856
 plates unto my brother Chemish

47
00:13:04,45 --> 00:13:27,164
9 Now I, Chemish, write what few things I write,

48
00:13:27,164 --> 00:13:49,878
 in the same book with my brother; for behold, I saw

49
00:13:49,878 --> 00:14:12,592
 the last which he wrote, that he wrote it with

50
00:14:12,592 --> 00:14:35,306
 his own hand; and he wrote it in the day that he

51
00:14:35,306 --> 00:14:58,02
 delivered them unto me. And after this manner we keep

52
00:14:58,02 --> 00:15:20,734
 the records, for it is according to the

53
00:15:20,734 --> 00:15:43,448
 commandments of our fathers. And I make an end

54
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:54,67
12 Behold, I am Amaleki, the son of Abinadom.

55
00:01:54,67 --> 00:02:05,67
 Behold, I will speak unto you somewhat concerning

56
00:02:05,67 --> 00:02:16,67
 Mosiah, who was made king over the land of Zarahemla;

57
00:02:16,67 --> 00:02:27,67
 for behold, he being warned of the Lord that he

58
00:02:27,67 --> 00:02:38,67
 should flee out of the land of Nephi, and as many as

59
00:02:38,67 --> 00:02:49,67
 would hearken unto the voice of the Lord should

60
00:02:49,67 --> 00:03:00,67
 also depart out of the land with him, into the

61
00:03:00,67 --> 00:03:11,67
 wilderness

62
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:21,169
13 And it came to pass that he did according as

63
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:30,947
 the Lord had commanded him. And they departed out of

64
00:03:30,947 --> 00:03:40,725
 the land into the wilderness, as many as would

65
00:03:40,725 --> 00:03:50,503
 hearken unto the voice of the Lord; and they were

66
00:03:50,503 --> 00:04:00,281
 led by many preachings and prophesyings. And they

67
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:10,059
 were admonished continually by the word of God; and

68
00:04:10,059 --> 00:04:19,837
 they were led by the power of his arm, through the

69
00:04:19,837 --> 00:04:29,615
 wilderness until they came down into the land

70
00:04:29,615 --> 00:04:39,393
 which is called the land of Zarahemla

71
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:54,945
14 And they discovered a people, who were called

72
00:04:54,945 --> 00:05:10,778
 the people of Zarahemla. Now, there was great

73
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:26,611
 rejoicing among the people of Zarahemla; and also

74
00:05:26,611 --> 00:05:42,444
 Zarahemla did rejoice exceedingly, because the Lord had

75
00:05:42,444 --> 00:05:58,277
 sent the people of Mosiah with the plates of

76
00:05:58,277 --> 00:06:14,11
 brass which contained the record of the Jews

77
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:20,808
15 Behold, it came to pass that Mosiah discovered

78
00:06:20,808 --> 00:06:26,808
 that the people of Zarahemla came out from

79
00:06:26,808 --> 00:06:32,808
 Jerusalem at the time that Zedekiah, king of Judah, was

80
00:06:32,808 --> 00:06:38,808
 carried away captive into Babylon

81
00:06:38,732 --> 00:07:02,732
16 And they journeyed in the wilderness, and were

82
00:07:02,732 --> 00:07:26,732
 brought by the hand of the Lord across the great

83
00:07:26,732 --> 00:07:50,732
 waters, into the land where Mosiah discovered them;

84
00:07:50,732 --> 00:08:14,732
 and they had dwelt there from that time forth

85
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:26,427
17 And at the time that Mosiah discovered them,

86
00:08:26,427 --> 00:08:38,427
 they had become exceedingly numerous. Nevertheless,

87
00:08:38,427 --> 00:08:50,427
 they had had many wars and serious contentions,

88
00:08:50,427 --> 00:09:02,427
 and had fallen by the sword from time to time; and

89
00:09:02,427 --> 00:09:14,427
 their language had become corrupted; and they had

90
00:09:14,427 --> 00:09:26,427
 brought no records with them; and they denied the

91
00:09:26,427 --> 00:09:38,427
 being of their Creator; and Mosiah, nor the people

92
00:09:38,427 --> 00:09:50,427
 of Mosiah, could understand them

93
00:09:50,123 --> 00:10:07,29
18 But it came to pass that Mosiah caused that

94
00:10:07,29 --> 00:10:24,457
 they should be taught in his language. And it came to

95
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:41,624
 pass that after they were taught in the language

96
00:10:41,624 --> 00:10:58,791
 of Mosiah, Zarahemla gave a genealogy of his

97
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:15,958
 fathers, according to his memory; and they are written,

98
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:33,125
 but not in these plates

99
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:47,126
19 And it came to pass that the people of

100
00:11:47,126 --> 00:12:00,459
 Zarahemla, and of Mosiah, did unite together; and Mosiah

101
00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:13,792
 was appointed to be their king

102
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,666
20 And it came to pass in the days of Mosiah,

103
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:17,666
 there was a large stone brought unto him with

104
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,666
 engravings on it; and he did interpret the engravings by

105
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,666
 the gift and power of God

106
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:47,641
21 And they gave an account of one Coriantumr, and

107
00:12:47,641 --> 00:13:13,641
 the slain of his people. And Coriantumr was

108
00:13:13,641 --> 00:13:39,641
 discovered by the people of Zarahemla; and he dwelt

109
00:13:39,641 --> 00:14:05,641
 with them for the space of nine moons

110
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:12,168
22 It also spake a few words concerning his

111
00:14:12,168 --> 00:14:19,025
 fathers. And his first parents came out from the tower,

112
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:25,882
 at the time the Lord confounded the language of

113
00:14:25,882 --> 00:14:32,739
 the people; and the severity of the Lord fell upon

114
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:39,596
 them according to his judgments, which are just;

115
00:14:39,596 --> 00:14:46,453
 and their bones lay scattered in the land northward

116
00:14:46,453 --> 00:14:53,31


117
00:14:53,159 --> 00:15:30,159
23 Behold, I, Amaleki, was born in the days of

118
00:15:30,159 --> 00:16:07,159
 Mosiah; and I have lived to see his death; and

119
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:44,159
 Benjamin, his son, reigneth in his stead

120
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:45,471
24 And behold, I have seen, in the days of king

121
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:46,138
 Benjamin, a serious war and much bloodshed between

122
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:46,805
 the Nephites and the Lamanites. But behold, the

123
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:47,472
 Nephites did obtain much advantage over them; yea,

124
00:16:47,472 --> 00:16:48,139
 insomuch that king Benjamin did drive them out of

125
00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:48,806
 the land of Zarahemla

126
00:16:48,074 --> 00:17:02,657
25 And it came to pass that I began to be old;

127
00:17:02,657 --> 00:17:17,24
 and, having no seed, and knowing king Benjamin to be

128
00:17:17,24 --> 00:17:31,823
 a just man before the Lord, wherefore, I shall

129
00:17:31,823 --> 00:17:46,406
 deliver up these plates unto him, exhorting all men

130
00:17:46,406 --> 00:18:00,989
 to come unto God, the Holy One of Israel, and

131
00:18:00,989 --> 00:18:15,572
 believe in prophesying, and in revelations, and in the

132
00:18:15,572 --> 00:18:30,155
 ministering of angels, and in the gift of speaking

133
00:18:30,155 --> 00:18:44,738
 with tongues, and in the gift of interpreting

134
00:18:44,738 --> 00:18:59,321
 languages, and in all things which are good; for

135
00:18:59,321 --> 00:19:13,904
 there is nothing which is good save it comes from the

136
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:28,487
 Lord: and that which is evil cometh from the

137
00:19:28,487 --> 00:19:43,07
 devil

138
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:58,337
28 Wherefore, they went up into the wilderness.

139
00:01:58,337 --> 00:02:13,004
 And their leader being a strong and mighty man, and

140
00:02:13,004 --> 00:02:27,671
 a stiffnecked man, wherefore he caused a

141
00:02:27,671 --> 00:02:42,338
 contention among them; and they were all slain, save fifty,

142
00:02:42,338 --> 00:02:57,005
 in the wilderness, and they returned again to the

143
00:02:57,005 --> 00:03:11,672
 land of Zarahemla

144
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:40,724
29 And it came to pass that they also took others

145
00:03:40,724 --> 00:04:10,057
 to a considerable number, and took their journey

146
00:04:10,057 --> 00:04:39,39
 again into the wilderness

147
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:39,112
30 And I, Amaleki, had a brother, who also went

148
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:39,112
 with them; and I have not since known concerning

149
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:39,112
 them. And I am about to lie down in my grave; and

150
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:39,112
 these plates are full. And I make an end of my

151
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:39,112
 speaking.
