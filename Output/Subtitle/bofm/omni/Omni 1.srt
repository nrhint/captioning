00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:02,0
The Book of OmniChapter 1 Omni, Amaron,

2
00:00:02,0 --> 00:00:04,0
Chemish, Abinadom, and Amaleki, each in turn, keep

3
00:00:04,0 --> 00:00:06,0
the records—Mosiah discovers the people of

4
00:00:06,0 --> 00:00:08,0
Zarahemla, who came from Jerusalem in the days of

5
00:00:08,0 --> 00:00:10,0
Zedekiah—Mosiah is made king over them—The

6
00:00:10,0 --> 00:00:12,0
descendants of Mulek at Zarahemla had discovered

7
00:00:12,0 --> 00:00:14,0
Coriantumr, the last of the Jaredites—King

8
00:00:14,0 --> 00:00:16,0
Benjamin succeeds Mosiah—Men should offer their

9
00:00:16,0 --> 00:00:18,318
souls as an offering to Christ. About 323–130 B.C. 

10
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:19,568
1 Behold, it came to pass that I,

11
00:00:19,568 --> 00:00:20,818
Omni, being commanded by my father,

12
00:00:20,818 --> 00:00:22,068
Jarom, that I should write somewhat upon

13
00:00:22,068 --> 00:00:23,257
these plates, to preserve our genealogy—

14
00:00:23,257 --> 00:00:27,368
2 Wherefore, in my days, I would

15
00:00:27,368 --> 00:00:31,479
that ye should know that I fought

16
00:00:31,479 --> 00:00:35,59
much with the sword to preserve my

17
00:00:35,59 --> 00:00:39,701
people, the Nephites, from falling

18
00:00:39,701 --> 00:00:43,812
into the hands of their enemies, the

19
00:00:43,812 --> 00:00:47,923
Lamanites. But behold, I of myself

20
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:52,034
am a wicked man, and I have not kept

21
00:00:52,034 --> 00:00:56,145
the statutes and the commandments

22
00:00:56,145 --> 00:01:00,994
of the Lord as I ought to have done.

23
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:02,358
3 And it came to pass that two

24
00:01:02,358 --> 00:01:03,722
hundred and seventy and six years had

25
00:01:03,722 --> 00:01:05,086
passed away, and we had many

26
00:01:05,086 --> 00:01:06,45
seasons of peace; and we had many

27
00:01:06,45 --> 00:01:07,814
seasons of serious war and bloodshed.

28
00:01:07,814 --> 00:01:09,178
Yea, and in fine, two hundred and

29
00:01:09,178 --> 00:01:10,542
eighty and two years had passed

30
00:01:10,542 --> 00:01:11,906
away, and I had kept these plates

31
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:13,27
according to the commandments of my

32
00:01:13,27 --> 00:01:14,634
fathers; and I conferred them upon

33
00:01:14,634 --> 00:01:15,976
my son Amaron. And I make an end.

34
00:01:15,976 --> 00:01:18,643
4 And now I, Amaron, write the

35
00:01:18,643 --> 00:01:21,31
things whatsoever I write, which

36
00:01:21,31 --> 00:01:23,483
are few, in the book of my father.

37
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:23,283
5 Behold, it came to pass

38
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:23,083
that three hundred and

39
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:22,883
twenty years had passed away,

40
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:22,683
and the more wicked part of

41
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:22,549
the Nephites were destroyed.

42
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:22,703
6 For the Lord would not

43
00:01:22,703 --> 00:01:22,857
suffer, after he had led

44
00:01:22,857 --> 00:01:23,011
them out of the land of

45
00:01:23,011 --> 00:01:23,165
Jerusalem and kept and

46
00:01:23,165 --> 00:01:23,319
preserved them from falling into

47
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:23,473
the hands of their

48
00:01:23,473 --> 00:01:23,627
enemies, yea, he would not suffer

49
00:01:23,627 --> 00:01:23,781
that the words should not

50
00:01:23,781 --> 00:01:23,935
be verified, which he

51
00:01:23,935 --> 00:01:24,089
spake unto our fathers,

52
00:01:24,089 --> 00:01:24,243
saying that: Inasmuch as ye

53
00:01:24,243 --> 00:01:24,397
will not keep my commandments

54
00:01:24,397 --> 00:01:24,484
ye shall not prosper in the land.

55
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:24,341
7 Wherefore, the Lord did

56
00:01:24,341 --> 00:01:24,198
visit them in great

57
00:01:24,198 --> 00:01:24,055
judgment; nevertheless, he

58
00:01:24,055 --> 00:01:23,912
did spare the righteous

59
00:01:23,912 --> 00:01:23,769
that they should not perish,

60
00:01:23,769 --> 00:01:23,626
but did deliver them out

61
00:01:23,626 --> 00:01:23,55
of the hands of their enemies.

62
00:01:23,55 --> 00:01:23,3
8 And it came to

63
00:01:23,3 --> 00:01:23,05
pass that I did

64
00:01:23,05 --> 00:01:22,8
deliver the plates unto

65
00:01:22,8 --> 00:01:22,616
my brother Chemish.

66
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:22,56
9 Now I, Chemish,

67
00:01:22,56 --> 00:01:22,504
write what few

68
00:01:22,504 --> 00:01:22,448
things I write, in

69
00:01:22,448 --> 00:01:22,392
the same book with

70
00:01:22,392 --> 00:01:22,336
my brother; for

71
00:01:22,336 --> 00:01:22,28
behold, I saw the

72
00:01:22,28 --> 00:01:22,224
last which he wrote,

73
00:01:22,224 --> 00:01:22,168
that he wrote it

74
00:01:22,168 --> 00:01:22,112
with his own hand;

75
00:01:22,112 --> 00:01:22,056
and he wrote it in

76
00:01:22,056 --> 00:01:21,0
the day that he

77
00:01:21,0 --> 00:01:21,944
delivered them unto

78
00:01:21,944 --> 00:01:21,888
me. And after

79
00:01:21,888 --> 00:01:21,832
this manner we keep

80
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:21,776
the records, for it

81
00:01:21,776 --> 00:01:21,72
is according to

82
00:01:21,72 --> 00:01:21,664
the commandments of

83
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:21,682
our fathers. And I make an end.

84
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:21,615
10 Behold, I,

85
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:21,548
Abinadom, am the son

86
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:21,481
of Chemish.

87
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:21,414
Behold, it came to

88
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:21,347
pass that I saw

89
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:21,28
much war and

90
00:01:21,28 --> 00:01:21,213
contention between my

91
00:01:21,213 --> 00:01:21,146
people, the

92
00:01:21,146 --> 00:01:21,079
Nephites, and the

93
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:21,012
Lamanites; and I, with

94
00:01:21,012 --> 00:01:20,945
my own sword,

95
00:01:20,945 --> 00:01:20,878
have taken the lives

96
00:01:20,878 --> 00:01:20,811
of many of the

97
00:01:20,811 --> 00:01:20,744
Lamanites in the

98
00:01:20,744 --> 00:01:20,747
defence of my brethren.

99
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:21,059
11 And behold,

100
00:01:21,059 --> 00:01:21,371
the record of

101
00:01:21,371 --> 00:01:21,683
this people is

102
00:01:21,683 --> 00:01:21,995
engraven upon plates

103
00:01:21,995 --> 00:01:22,307
which is had by

104
00:01:22,307 --> 00:01:22,619
the kings,

105
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:22,931
according to the

106
00:01:22,931 --> 00:01:23,243
generations; and I

107
00:01:23,243 --> 00:01:23,555
know of no

108
00:01:23,555 --> 00:01:23,867
revelation save that

109
00:01:23,867 --> 00:01:24,179
which has been

110
00:01:24,179 --> 00:01:24,491
written, neither

111
00:01:24,491 --> 00:01:24,803
prophecy;

112
00:01:24,803 --> 00:01:25,115
wherefore, that which

113
00:01:25,115 --> 00:01:25,427
is sufficient is

114
00:01:25,427 --> 00:01:25,152
written. And I make an end.

115
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:26,065
12 Behold, I am

116
00:01:26,065 --> 00:01:26,978
Amaleki, the

117
00:01:26,978 --> 00:01:27,891
son of Abinadom.

118
00:01:27,891 --> 00:01:28,804
Behold, I will

119
00:01:28,804 --> 00:01:29,717
speak unto you

120
00:01:29,717 --> 00:01:30,63
somewhat

121
00:01:30,63 --> 00:01:31,543
concerning Mosiah,

122
00:01:31,543 --> 00:01:32,456
who was made

123
00:01:32,456 --> 00:01:33,369
king over the land

124
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:34,282
of Zarahemla;

125
00:01:34,282 --> 00:01:35,195
for behold, he

126
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:36,108
being warned of

127
00:01:36,108 --> 00:01:37,021
the Lord that

128
00:01:37,021 --> 00:01:37,934
he should flee

129
00:01:37,934 --> 00:01:38,847
out of the land

130
00:01:38,847 --> 00:01:39,76
of Nephi, and

131
00:01:39,76 --> 00:01:40,673
as many as

132
00:01:40,673 --> 00:01:41,586
would hearken unto

133
00:01:41,586 --> 00:01:42,499
the voice of

134
00:01:42,499 --> 00:01:43,412
the Lord should

135
00:01:43,412 --> 00:01:44,325
also depart out

136
00:01:44,325 --> 00:01:45,238
of the land

137
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:46,473
with him, into the wilderness—

138
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:47,611
13 And it came

139
00:01:47,611 --> 00:01:48,749
to pass that he

140
00:01:48,749 --> 00:01:49,887
did according

141
00:01:49,887 --> 00:01:51,025
as the Lord had

142
00:01:51,025 --> 00:01:52,163
commanded him.

143
00:01:52,163 --> 00:01:53,301
And they

144
00:01:53,301 --> 00:01:54,439
departed out of the

145
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:55,577
land into the

146
00:01:55,577 --> 00:01:56,715
wilderness, as

147
00:01:56,715 --> 00:01:57,853
many as would

148
00:01:57,853 --> 00:01:58,991
hearken unto the

149
00:01:58,991 --> 00:02:00,129
voice of the

150
00:02:00,129 --> 00:02:01,267
Lord; and they

151
00:02:01,267 --> 00:02:02,405
were led by many

152
00:02:02,405 --> 00:02:03,543
preachings and

153
00:02:03,543 --> 00:02:04,681
prophesyings.

154
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:05,819
And they were

155
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:06,957
admonished

156
00:02:06,957 --> 00:02:08,095
continually by the

157
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:09,233
word of God; and

158
00:02:09,233 --> 00:02:10,371
they were led

159
00:02:10,371 --> 00:02:11,509
by the power of

160
00:02:11,509 --> 00:02:12,647
his arm,

161
00:02:12,647 --> 00:02:13,785
through the

162
00:02:13,785 --> 00:02:14,923
wilderness until they

163
00:02:14,923 --> 00:02:16,061
came down into

164
00:02:16,061 --> 00:02:17,199
the land which is

165
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:18,337
called the

166
00:02:18,337 --> 00:02:19,339
land of Zarahemla.

167
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:20,239
14 And they

168
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,139
discovered a

169
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:22,039
people, who were

170
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:22,939
called the

171
00:02:22,939 --> 00:02:23,839
people of

172
00:02:23,839 --> 00:02:24,739
Zarahemla. Now, there

173
00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:25,639
was great

174
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:26,539
rejoicing among

175
00:02:26,539 --> 00:02:27,439
the people of

176
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,339
Zarahemla; and

177
00:02:28,339 --> 00:02:29,239
also Zarahemla

178
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:30,139
did rejoice

179
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:31,039
exceedingly,

180
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:31,939
because the Lord

181
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:32,839
had sent the

182
00:02:32,839 --> 00:02:33,739
people of

183
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:34,639
Mosiah with the

184
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:35,539
plates of brass

185
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:36,439
which

186
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:37,19
contained the record of the Jews.

187
00:02:37,19 --> 00:02:37,119
15 Behold, it

188
00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:37,048
came to pass

189
00:02:37,048 --> 00:02:36,977
that Mosiah

190
00:02:36,977 --> 00:02:36,906
discovered

191
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:36,835
that the people

192
00:02:36,835 --> 00:02:36,764
of Zarahemla

193
00:02:36,764 --> 00:02:36,693
came out

194
00:02:36,693 --> 00:02:36,622
from Jerusalem

195
00:02:36,622 --> 00:02:36,551
at the time

196
00:02:36,551 --> 00:02:36,48
that Zedekiah,

197
00:02:36,48 --> 00:02:36,409
king of

198
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:36,338
Judah, was carried

199
00:02:36,338 --> 00:02:36,267
away captive

200
00:02:36,267 --> 00:02:36,256
into Babylon.

201
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:36,444
16 And they

202
00:02:36,444 --> 00:02:36,632
journeyed in

203
00:02:36,632 --> 00:02:36,82
the

204
00:02:36,82 --> 00:02:37,008
wilderness, and

205
00:02:37,008 --> 00:02:37,196
were brought by

206
00:02:37,196 --> 00:02:37,384
the hand of

207
00:02:37,384 --> 00:02:37,572
the Lord

208
00:02:37,572 --> 00:02:37,76
across the

209
00:02:37,76 --> 00:02:37,948
great waters,

210
00:02:37,948 --> 00:02:38,136
into the land

211
00:02:38,136 --> 00:02:38,324
where

212
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:38,512
Mosiah discovered

213
00:02:38,512 --> 00:02:38,7
them; and

214
00:02:38,7 --> 00:02:38,888
they had

215
00:02:38,888 --> 00:02:39,076
dwelt there from

216
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:39,726
that time forth.

217
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:40,038
17 And at

218
00:02:40,038 --> 00:02:40,35
the time

219
00:02:40,35 --> 00:02:40,662
that Mosiah

220
00:02:40,662 --> 00:02:40,974
discovered

221
00:02:40,974 --> 00:02:41,286
them, they

222
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:41,598
had become

223
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:41,91
exceedingly

224
00:02:41,91 --> 00:02:42,222
numerous.

225
00:02:42,222 --> 00:02:42,534
Nevertheless,

226
00:02:42,534 --> 00:02:42,846
they had

227
00:02:42,846 --> 00:02:43,158
had many

228
00:02:43,158 --> 00:02:43,47
wars and

229
00:02:43,47 --> 00:02:43,782
serious

230
00:02:43,782 --> 00:02:44,094
contentions, and

231
00:02:44,094 --> 00:02:44,406
had fallen by

232
00:02:44,406 --> 00:02:44,718
the sword

233
00:02:44,718 --> 00:02:45,03
from time

234
00:02:45,03 --> 00:02:45,342
to time; and

235
00:02:45,342 --> 00:02:45,654
their

236
00:02:45,654 --> 00:02:45,966
language had

237
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:46,278
become

238
00:02:46,278 --> 00:02:46,59
corrupted; and

239
00:02:46,59 --> 00:02:46,902
they had

240
00:02:46,902 --> 00:02:47,214
brought no

241
00:02:47,214 --> 00:02:47,526
records with

242
00:02:47,526 --> 00:02:47,838
them; and

243
00:02:47,838 --> 00:02:48,15
they denied

244
00:02:48,15 --> 00:02:48,462
the being of

245
00:02:48,462 --> 00:02:48,774
their

246
00:02:48,774 --> 00:02:49,086
Creator; and

247
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:49,398
Mosiah, nor

248
00:02:49,398 --> 00:02:49,636
the people of Mosiah, could understand them.

249
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:49,756
18 But it

250
00:02:49,756 --> 00:02:49,876
came to pass

251
00:02:49,876 --> 00:02:49,996
that

252
00:02:49,996 --> 00:02:50,116
Mosiah caused

253
00:02:50,116 --> 00:02:50,236
that they

254
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:50,356
should be

255
00:02:50,356 --> 00:02:50,476
taught in his

256
00:02:50,476 --> 00:02:50,596
language.

257
00:02:50,596 --> 00:02:50,716
And it came

258
00:02:50,716 --> 00:02:50,836
to pass that

259
00:02:50,836 --> 00:02:50,956
after they

260
00:02:50,956 --> 00:02:51,076
were

261
00:02:51,076 --> 00:02:51,196
taught in the

262
00:02:51,196 --> 00:02:51,316
language of

263
00:02:51,316 --> 00:02:51,436
Mosiah,

264
00:02:51,436 --> 00:02:51,556
Zarahemla gave

265
00:02:51,556 --> 00:02:51,676
a genealogy

266
00:02:51,676 --> 00:02:51,796
of his

267
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:51,916
fathers,

268
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:52,036
according to his

269
00:02:52,036 --> 00:02:52,156
memory;

270
00:02:52,156 --> 00:02:52,276
and they are

271
00:02:52,276 --> 00:02:52,396
written,

272
00:02:52,396 --> 00:02:52,516
but not in

273
00:02:52,516 --> 00:02:52,639
these plates.

274
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:52,639
19 And it

275
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:52,639
came to

276
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:52,639
pass that

277
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:52,639
the people

278
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:52,639
of

279
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:52,639
Zarahemla, and of

280
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:52,639
Mosiah,

281
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:52,639
did unite

282
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:52,639
together;

283
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:52,639
and Mosiah

284
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:52,639
was

285
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:52,172
appointed to be their king.

286
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:52,505
20 And it

287
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:52,838
came to

288
00:02:52,838 --> 00:02:53,171
pass in

289
00:02:53,171 --> 00:02:53,504
the days

290
00:02:53,504 --> 00:02:53,837
of Mosiah,

291
00:02:53,837 --> 00:02:54,17
there

292
00:02:54,17 --> 00:02:54,503
was a large

293
00:02:54,503 --> 00:02:54,836
stone

294
00:02:54,836 --> 00:02:55,169
brought

295
00:02:55,169 --> 00:02:55,502
unto him

296
00:02:55,502 --> 00:02:55,835
with

297
00:02:55,835 --> 00:02:56,168
engravings on

298
00:02:56,168 --> 00:02:56,501
it; and he

299
00:02:56,501 --> 00:02:56,834
did

300
00:02:56,834 --> 00:02:57,167
interpret the

301
00:02:57,167 --> 00:02:57,5


302
00:02:57,5 --> 00:02:57,833
engravings by the

303
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:58,512
gift and power of God.

304
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:58,512
21 And

305
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:58,512
they gave

306
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:58,512
an

307
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:58,512
account of

308
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:58,512
one

309
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:58,512
Coriantumr,

310
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:58,512
and the

311
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:58,512
slain of

312
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:58,512
his

313
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:58,512
people. And

314
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:58,512


315
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:58,512
Coriantumr was

316
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:58,512


317
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:58,512
discovered by the

318
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:58,512
people

319
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:58,512
of

320
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:58,512
Zarahemla;

321
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:58,512
and he

322
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:58,512
dwelt with

323
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:58,512
them for

324
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:58,045
the space of nine moons.

325
00:02:58,045 --> 00:02:58,124
22 It

326
00:02:58,124 --> 00:02:58,203
also

327
00:02:58,203 --> 00:02:58,282
spake a

328
00:02:58,282 --> 00:02:58,361
few words

329
00:02:58,361 --> 00:02:58,44


330
00:02:58,44 --> 00:02:58,519
concerning

331
00:02:58,519 --> 00:02:58,598
his

332
00:02:58,598 --> 00:02:58,677
fathers. And

333
00:02:58,677 --> 00:02:58,756
his

334
00:02:58,756 --> 00:02:58,835
first

335
00:02:58,835 --> 00:02:58,914
parents

336
00:02:58,914 --> 00:02:58,993
came out

337
00:02:58,993 --> 00:02:59,072
from

338
00:02:59,072 --> 00:02:59,151
the

339
00:02:59,151 --> 00:02:59,23
tower, at

340
00:02:59,23 --> 00:02:59,309
the time

341
00:02:59,309 --> 00:02:59,388
the

342
00:02:59,388 --> 00:02:59,467
Lord

343
00:02:59,467 --> 00:02:59,546
confounded

344
00:02:59,546 --> 00:02:59,625
the

345
00:02:59,625 --> 00:02:59,704
language of

346
00:02:59,704 --> 00:02:59,783
the

347
00:02:59,783 --> 00:02:59,862
people;

348
00:02:59,862 --> 00:02:59,941
and the

349
00:02:59,941 --> 00:03:00,02


350
00:03:00,02 --> 00:03:00,099
severity of

351
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:00,178
the Lord

352
00:03:00,178 --> 00:03:00,257
fell

353
00:03:00,257 --> 00:03:00,336
upon them

354
00:03:00,336 --> 00:03:00,415


355
00:03:00,415 --> 00:03:00,494
according to

356
00:03:00,494 --> 00:03:00,573
his

357
00:03:00,573 --> 00:03:00,652
judgments,

358
00:03:00,652 --> 00:03:00,731
which

359
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:00,81
are

360
00:03:00,81 --> 00:03:00,889
just; and

361
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:00,968
their

362
00:03:00,968 --> 00:03:01,515
bones lay scattered in the land northward.

363
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:01,515
23

364
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:01,515
Behold,

365
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:01,515
I,

366
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:01,515
Amaleki,

367
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:01,515
was

368
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:01,515
born in

369
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:01,515
the

370
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:01,515
days of

371
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:01,515
Mosiah;

372
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:01,515
and I

373
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:01,515
have

374
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:01,515
lived

375
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:01,515
to see

376
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:01,515
his

377
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:01,515
death;

378
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:01,515
and

379
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:01,515


380
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:01,515
Benjamin, his

381
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:01,515
son,

382
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:01,048
reigneth in his stead.

383
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:01,115
24 And

384
00:03:01,115 --> 00:03:01,182


385
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:01,249
behold, I

386
00:03:01,249 --> 00:03:01,316
have

387
00:03:01,316 --> 00:03:01,383
seen, in

388
00:03:01,383 --> 00:03:01,45
the

389
00:03:01,45 --> 00:03:01,517
days of

390
00:03:01,517 --> 00:03:01,584
king

391
00:03:01,584 --> 00:03:01,651


392
00:03:01,651 --> 00:03:01,718
Benjamin, a

393
00:03:01,718 --> 00:03:01,785


394
00:03:01,785 --> 00:03:01,852
serious war

395
00:03:01,852 --> 00:03:01,919
and

396
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:01,986
much

397
00:03:01,986 --> 00:03:02,053
bloodshed

398
00:03:02,053 --> 00:03:02,12


399
00:03:02,12 --> 00:03:02,187
between the

400
00:03:02,187 --> 00:03:02,254


401
00:03:02,254 --> 00:03:02,321
Nephites

402
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:02,388
and the

403
00:03:02,388 --> 00:03:02,455


404
00:03:02,455 --> 00:03:02,522
Lamanites.

405
00:03:02,522 --> 00:03:02,589
But

406
00:03:02,589 --> 00:03:02,656
behold,

407
00:03:02,656 --> 00:03:02,723
the

408
00:03:02,723 --> 00:03:02,79
