00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
The Book of OmniChapter 1 Omni, Amaron,

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chemish, Abinadom, and Amaleki, each in turn, keep

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the records—Mosiah discovers the people of

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Zarahemla, who came from Jerusalem in the days of

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Zedekiah—Mosiah is made king over them—The

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
descendants of Mulek at Zarahemla had discovered

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Coriantumr, the last of the Jaredites—King

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Benjamin succeeds Mosiah—Men should offer their

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:04:13,
souls as an offering to Christ. About 323–130 B.C. 

10
00:04:13,0 --> 00:04:13,0
1 Behold, it came to pass that I,

11
00:04:13,0 --> 00:04:13,0
Omni, being commanded by my father,

12
00:04:13,0 --> 00:04:13,0
Jarom, that I should write somewhat upon

13
00:04:13,0 --> 00:10:10,
these plates, to preserve our genealogy—

14
00:10:10,0 --> 00:10:10,0
2 Wherefore, in my days, I would

15
00:10:10,0 --> 00:10:10,0
that ye should know that I fought

16
00:10:10,0 --> 00:10:10,0
much with the sword to preserve my

17
00:10:10,0 --> 00:10:10,0
people, the Nephites, from falling

18
00:10:10,0 --> 00:10:10,0
into the hands of their enemies, the

19
00:10:10,0 --> 00:10:10,0
Lamanites. But behold, I of myself

20
00:10:10,0 --> 00:10:10,0
am a wicked man, and I have not kept

21
00:10:10,0 --> 00:10:10,0
the statutes and the commandments

22
00:10:10,0 --> 00:14:23,
of the Lord as I ought to have done.

23
00:14:23,0 --> 00:14:23,0
3 And it came to pass that two

24
00:14:23,0 --> 00:14:23,0
hundred and seventy and six years had

25
00:14:23,0 --> 00:14:23,0
passed away, and we had many

26
00:14:23,0 --> 00:14:23,0
seasons of peace; and we had many

27
00:14:23,0 --> 00:14:23,0
seasons of serious war and bloodshed.

28
00:14:23,0 --> 00:14:23,0
Yea, and in fine, two hundred and

29
00:14:23,0 --> 00:14:23,0
eighty and two years had passed

30
00:14:23,0 --> 00:14:23,0
away, and I had kept these plates

31
00:14:23,0 --> 00:14:23,0
according to the commandments of my

32
00:14:23,0 --> 00:14:23,0
fathers; and I conferred them upon

33
00:14:23,0 --> 00:13:55,
my son Amaron. And I make an end.

34
00:13:55,0 --> 00:13:55,0
4 And now I, Amaron, write the

35
00:13:55,0 --> 00:13:55,0
things whatsoever I write, which

36
00:13:55,0 --> 00:14:53,
are few, in the book of my father.

37
00:14:53,0 --> 00:14:53,0
5 Behold, it came to pass

38
00:14:53,0 --> 00:14:53,0
that three hundred and

39
00:14:53,0 --> 00:14:53,0
twenty years had passed away,

40
00:14:53,0 --> 00:14:53,0
and the more wicked part of

41
00:14:53,0 --> 00:30:35,
the Nephites were destroyed.

42
00:30:35,0 --> 00:30:35,0
6 For the Lord would not

43
00:30:35,0 --> 00:30:35,0
suffer, after he had led

44
00:30:35,0 --> 00:30:35,0
them out of the land of

45
00:30:35,0 --> 00:30:35,0
Jerusalem and kept and

46
00:30:35,0 --> 00:30:35,0
preserved them from falling into

47
00:30:35,0 --> 00:30:35,0
the hands of their

48
00:30:35,0 --> 00:30:35,0
enemies, yea, he would not suffer

49
00:30:35,0 --> 00:30:35,0
that the words should not

50
00:30:35,0 --> 00:30:35,0
be verified, which he

51
00:30:35,0 --> 00:30:35,0
spake unto our fathers,

52
00:30:35,0 --> 00:30:35,0
saying that: Inasmuch as ye

53
00:30:35,0 --> 00:30:35,0
will not keep my commandments

54
00:30:35,0 --> 00:34:19,
ye shall not prosper in the land.

55
00:34:19,0 --> 00:34:19,0
7 Wherefore, the Lord did

56
00:34:19,0 --> 00:34:19,0
visit them in great

57
00:34:19,0 --> 00:34:19,0
judgment; nevertheless, he

58
00:34:19,0 --> 00:34:19,0
did spare the righteous

59
00:34:19,0 --> 00:34:19,0
that they should not perish,

60
00:34:19,0 --> 00:34:19,0
but did deliver them out

61
00:34:19,0 --> 00:33:51,
of the hands of their enemies.

62
00:33:51,0 --> 00:33:51,0
8 And it came to

63
00:33:51,0 --> 00:33:51,0
pass that I did

64
00:33:51,0 --> 00:33:51,0
deliver the plates unto

65
00:33:51,0 --> 00:37:35,
my brother Chemish.

66
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
9 Now I, Chemish,

67
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
write what few

68
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
things I write, in

69
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
the same book with

70
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
my brother; for

71
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
behold, I saw the

72
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
last which he wrote,

73
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
that he wrote it

74
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
with his own hand;

75
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
and he wrote it in

76
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
the day that he

77
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
delivered them unto

78
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
me. And after

79
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
this manner we keep

80
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
the records, for it

81
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
is according to

82
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
the commandments of

83
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,
our fathers. And I make an end.

84
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
10 Behold, I,

85
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
Abinadom, am the son

86
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
of Chemish.

87
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
Behold, it came to

88
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
pass that I saw

89
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
much war and

90
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
contention between my

91
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
people, the

92
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
Nephites, and the

93
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
Lamanites; and I, with

94
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
my own sword,

95
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
have taken the lives

96
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
of many of the

97
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
Lamanites in the

98
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,
defence of my brethren.

99
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
11 And behold,

100
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
the record of

101
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
this people is

102
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
engraven upon plates

103
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
which is had by

104
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
the kings,

105
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
according to the

106
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
generations; and I

107
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
know of no

108
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
revelation save that

109
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
which has been

110
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
written, neither

111
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
prophecy;

112
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
wherefore, that which

113
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
is sufficient is

114
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,
written. And I make an end.

115
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
12 Behold, I am

116
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
Amaleki, the

117
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
son of Abinadom.

118
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
Behold, I will

119
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
speak unto you

120
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
somewhat

121
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
concerning Mosiah,

122
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
who was made

123
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
king over the land

124
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
of Zarahemla;

125
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
for behold, he

126
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
being warned of

127
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
the Lord that

128
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
he should flee

129
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
out of the land

130
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
of Nephi, and

131
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
as many as

132
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
would hearken unto

133
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
the voice of

134
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
the Lord should

135
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
also depart out

136
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
of the land

137
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,
with him, into the wilderness—

138
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
13 And it came

139
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
to pass that he

140
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
did according

141
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
as the Lord had

142
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
commanded him.

143
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
And they

144
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
departed out of the

145
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
land into the

146
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
wilderness, as

147
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
many as would

148
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
hearken unto the

149
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
voice of the

150
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
Lord; and they

151
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
were led by many

152
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
preachings and

153
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
prophesyings.

154
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
And they were

155
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
admonished

156
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
continually by the

157
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
word of God; and

158
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
they were led

159
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
by the power of

160
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
his arm,

161
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
through the

162
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
wilderness until they

163
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
came down into

164
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
the land which is

165
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
called the

166
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,
land of Zarahemla.

167
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
14 And they

168
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
discovered a

169
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
people, who were

170
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
called the

171
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
people of

172
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
Zarahemla. Now, there

173
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
was great

174
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
rejoicing among

175
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
the people of

176
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
Zarahemla; and

177
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
also Zarahemla

178
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
did rejoice

179
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
exceedingly,

180
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
because the Lord

181
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
had sent the

182
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
people of

183
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
Mosiah with the

184
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
plates of brass

185
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
which

186
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,
contained the record of the Jews.

187
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
15 Behold, it

188
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
came to pass

189
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
that Mosiah

190
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
discovered

191
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
that the people

192
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
of Zarahemla

193
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
came out

194
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
from Jerusalem

195
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
at the time

196
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
that Zedekiah,

197
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
king of

198
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
Judah, was carried

199
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
away captive

200
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,
into Babylon.

201
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
16 And they

202
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
journeyed in

203
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
the

204
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
wilderness, and

205
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
were brought by

206
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
the hand of

207
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
the Lord

208
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
across the

209
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
great waters,

210
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
into the land

211
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
where

212
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
Mosiah discovered

213
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
them; and

214
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
they had

215
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
dwelt there from

216
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,
that time forth.

217
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
17 And at

218
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
the time

219
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
that Mosiah

220
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
discovered

221
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
them, they

222
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
had become

223
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
exceedingly

224
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
numerous.

225
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
Nevertheless,

226
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
they had

227
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
had many

228
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
wars and

229
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
serious

230
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
contentions, and

231
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
had fallen by

232
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
the sword

233
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
from time

234
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
to time; and

235
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
their

236
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
language had

237
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
become

238
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
corrupted; and

239
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
they had

240
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
brought no

241
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
records with

242
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
them; and

243
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
they denied

244
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
the being of

245
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
their

246
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
Creator; and

247
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
Mosiah, nor

248
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,
the people of Mosiah, could understand them.

249
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
18 But it

250
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
came to pass

251
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
that

252
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
Mosiah caused

253
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
that they

254
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
should be

255
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
taught in his

256
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
language.

257
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
And it came

258
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
to pass that

259
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
after they

260
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
were

261
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
taught in the

262
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
language of

263
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
Mosiah,

264
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
Zarahemla gave

265
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
a genealogy

266
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
of his

267
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
fathers,

268
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
according to his

269
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
memory;

270
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
and they are

271
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
written,

272
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
but not in

273
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,
these plates.

274
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
19 And it

275
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
came to

276
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
pass that

277
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
the people

278
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
of

279
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
Zarahemla, and of

280
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
Mosiah,

281
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
did unite

282
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
together;

283
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
and Mosiah

284
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
was

285
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,
appointed to be their king.

286
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
20 And it

287
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
came to

288
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
pass in

289
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
the days

290
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
of Mosiah,

291
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
there

292
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
was a large

293
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
stone

294
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
brought

295
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
unto him

296
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
with

297
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
engravings on

298
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
it; and he

299
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
did

300
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
interpret the

301
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0


302
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
engravings by the

303
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,
gift and power of God.

304
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
21 And

305
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
they gave

306
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
an

307
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
account of

308
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
one

309
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
Coriantumr,

310
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
and the

311
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
slain of

312
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
his

313
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
people. And

314
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0


315
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
Coriantumr was

316
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0


317
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
discovered by the

318
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
people

319
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
of

320
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
Zarahemla;

321
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
and he

322
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
dwelt with

323
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
them for

324
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,
the space of nine moons.

325
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
22 It

326
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
also

327
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0

328
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0

329
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0


330
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
concerning

331
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
his

332
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
fathers. And

333
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
his

334

340
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
the time

342
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
Lord

343
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
confounded

00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
people;

348
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
and the

349
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0


350
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
severity of

351
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
the Lord

352
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
fell

353
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
upon them

354
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0


355
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
according to

356
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
his

357
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
judgments,

358
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
which

359
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
are

360
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
just; and

23

364
00:37:35,0 --> 00:37:35,0
Behold,
