00:00:07,727 --> 00:00:15,454
 Nephi—One of the Disciples of Jesus ChristAn account

3
00:00:15,454 --> 00:00:23,181
 of the people of Nephi, according to his

4
00:00:23,181 --> 00:00:30,908
 record.Chapter 1 The Nephites and the Lamanites are all

5
00:00:30,908 --> 00:00:38,635
 converted unto the Lord—They have all things in

6
00:00:38,635 --> 00:00:46,362
 common, work miracles, and prosper in the land—After

7
00:00:46,362 --> 00:00:54,089
 two centuries, divisions, evils, false churches,

8
00:00:54,089 --> 00:01:01,816
 and persecutions arise—After three hundred years,

9
00:01:01,816 --> 00:01:09,543
 both the Nephites and the Lamanites are

10
00:01:09,543 --> 00:01:17,27
 wicked—Ammaron hides up the sacred records. About A.D. 35–321.

11
00:01:17,27 --> 00:01:24,997


12
00:01:25,052 --> 00:01:30,338
1 And it came to pass that the thirty and fourth

13
00:01:30,338 --> 00:01:35,624
 year passed away, and also the thirty and fifth,

14
00:01:35,624 --> 00:01:40,91
 and behold the disciples of Jesus had formed a

15
00:01:40,91 --> 00:01:46,196
 church of Christ in all the lands round about. And as

16
00:01:46,196 --> 00:01:51,482
 many as did come unto them, and did truly repent of

17
00:01:51,482 --> 00:01:56,768
 their sins, were baptized in the name of Jesus;

18
00:01:56,768 --> 00:02:02,054
 and they did also receive the Holy Ghost

19
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:08,223
2 And it came to pass in the thirty and sixth

20
00:02:08,223 --> 00:02:13,723
 year, the people were all converted unto the Lord,

21
00:02:13,723 --> 00:02:19,223
 upon all the face of the land, both Nephites and

22
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:24,723
 Lamanites, and there were no contentions and

23
00:02:24,723 --> 00:02:30,223
 disputations among them, and every man did deal justly one

24
00:02:30,223 --> 00:02:35,723
 with another

25
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:41,972
3 And they had all things common among them;

26
00:02:41,972 --> 00:02:48,222
 therefore there were not rich and poor, bond and free,

27
00:02:48,222 --> 00:02:54,472
 but they were all made free, and partakers of the

28
00:02:54,472 --> 00:03:00,722
 heavenly gift

29
00:03:00,28 --> 00:03:04,947
4 And it came to pass that the thirty and seventh

30
00:03:04,947 --> 00:03:09,614
 year passed away also, and there still continued

31
00:03:09,614 --> 00:03:14,281
 to be peace in the land

32
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:20,502
5 And there were great and marvelous works wrought

33
00:03:20,502 --> 00:03:26,877
 by the disciples of Jesus, insomuch that they did

34
00:03:26,877 --> 00:03:33,252
 heal the sick, and raise the dead, and cause the

35
00:03:33,252 --> 00:03:39,627
 lame to walk, and the blind to receive their

36
00:03:39,627 --> 00:03:46,002
 sight, and the deaf to hear; and all manner of miracles

37
00:03:46,002 --> 00:03:52,377
 did they work among the children of men; and in

38
00:03:52,377 --> 00:03:58,752
 nothing did they work miracles save it were in the

39
00:03:58,752 --> 00:04:05,127
 name of Jesus

40
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:10,512
6 And thus did the thirty and eighth year pass

41
00:04:10,512 --> 00:04:15,512
 away, and also the thirty and ninth, and forty and

42
00:04:15,512 --> 00:04:20,512
 first, and the forty and second, yea, even until

43
00:04:20,512 --> 00:04:25,512
 forty and nine years had passed away, and also the

44
00:04:25,512 --> 00:04:30,512
 fifty and first, and the fifty and second; yea, and

45
00:04:30,512 --> 00:04:35,512
 even until fifty and nine years had passed away

46
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:43,742
7 And the Lord did prosper them exceedingly in the

47
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:51,742
 land; yea, insomuch that they did build cities

48
00:04:51,742 --> 00:04:59,742
 again where there had been cities burned

49
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:04,733
8 Yea, even that great city Zarahemla did they

50
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:09,733
 cause to be built again

51
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:16,976
9 But there were many cities which had been sunk,

52
00:05:16,976 --> 00:05:24,643
 and waters came up in the stead thereof; therefore

53
00:05:24,643 --> 00:05:32,31
 these cities could not be renewed

54
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:38,282
10 And now, behold, it came to pass that the

55
00:05:38,282 --> 00:05:44,032
 people of Nephi did wax strong, and did multiply

56
00:05:44,032 --> 00:05:49,782
 exceedingly fast, and became an exceedingly fair and

57
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:55,532
 delightsome people

58
00:05:55,488 --> 00:06:00,155
11 And they were married, and given in marriage,

59
00:06:00,155 --> 00:06:04,822
 and were blessed according to the multitude of the

60
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:09,489
 promises which the Lord had made unto them

61
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:15,736
12 And they did not walk any more after the

62
00:06:15,736 --> 00:06:21,569
 performances and ordinances of the law of Moses; but

63
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:27,402
 they did walk after the commandments which they had

64
00:06:27,402 --> 00:06:33,235
 received from their Lord and their God, continuing

65
00:06:33,235 --> 00:06:39,068
 in fasting and prayer, and in meeting together oft

66
00:06:39,068 --> 00:06:44,901
 both to pray and to hear the word of the Lord

67
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:49,604
13 And it came to pass that there was no

68
00:06:49,604 --> 00:06:54,604
 contention among all the people, in all the land; but there

69
00:06:54,604 --> 00:06:59,604
 were mighty miracles wrought among the disciples

70
00:06:59,604 --> 00:07:04,604
 of Jesus

71
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:06,335
14 And it came to pass that the seventy and first

72
00:07:06,335 --> 00:07:08,113
 year passed away, and also the seventy and second

73
00:07:08,113 --> 00:07:09,891
 year, yea, and in fine, till the seventy and ninth

74
00:07:09,891 --> 00:07:11,669
 year had passed away; yea, even an hundred years

75
00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:13,447
 had passed away, and the disciples of Jesus, whom

76
00:07:13,447 --> 00:07:15,225
 he had chosen, had all gone to the paradise of

77
00:07:15,225 --> 00:07:17,003
 God, save it were the three who should tarry; and

78
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,781
 there were other disciples ordained in their stead;

79
00:07:18,781 --> 00:07:20,559
 and also many of that generation had passed away

80
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:37,84
15 And it came to pass that there was no

81
00:07:37,84 --> 00:07:55,173
 contention in the land, because of the love of God which

82
00:07:55,173 --> 00:08:12,506
 did dwell in the hearts of the people

83
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:17,793
16 And there were no envyings, nor strifes, nor

84
00:08:17,793 --> 00:08:22,593
 tumults, nor whoredoms, nor lyings, nor murders, nor

85
00:08:22,593 --> 00:08:27,392
 any manner of lasciviousness; and surely there

86
00:08:27,392 --> 00:08:32,192
 could not be a happier people among all the people

87
00:08:32,192 --> 00:08:36,993
 who had been created by the hand of God

88
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:48,416
17 There were no robbers, nor murderers, neither

89
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:59,916
 were there Lamanites, nor any manner of -ites; but

90
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:11,416
 they were in one, the children of Christ, and

91
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:22,916
 heirs to the kingdom of God

92
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:28,629
18 And how blessed were they! For the Lord did

93
00:09:28,629 --> 00:09:34,462
 bless them in all their doings; yea, even they were

94
00:09:34,462 --> 00:09:40,295
 blessed and prospered until an hundred and ten

95
00:09:40,295 --> 00:09:46,128
 years had passed away; and the first generation from

96
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:51,961
 Christ had passed away, and there was no contention

97
00:09:51,961 --> 00:09:57,794
 in all the land

98
00:09:57,497 --> 00:10:03,997
19 And it came to pass that Nephi, he that kept

99
00:10:03,997 --> 00:10:10,497
 this last record, (and he kept it upon the plates of

100
00:10:10,497 --> 00:10:16,997
 Nephi) died, and his son Amos kept it in his

101
00:10:16,997 --> 00:10:23,497
 stead; and he kept it upon the plates of Nephi also

102
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:28,289
20 And he kept it eighty and four years, and there

103
00:10:28,289 --> 00:10:33,122
 was still peace in the land, save it were a small

104
00:10:33,122 --> 00:10:37,955
 part of the people who had revolted from the

105
00:10:37,955 --> 00:10:42,788
 church and taken upon them the name of Lamanites;

106
00:10:42,788 --> 00:10:47,621
 therefore there began to be Lamanites again in the

107
00:10:47,621 --> 00:10:52,454
 land

108
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:57,918
21 And it came to pass that Amos died also, (and

109
00:10:57,918 --> 00:11:03,418
 it was an hundred and ninety and four years from

110
00:11:03,418 --> 00:11:08,918
 the coming of Christ) and his son Amos kept the

111
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:14,418
 record in his stead; and he also kept it upon the

112
00:11:14,418 --> 00:11:19,918
 plates of Nephi; and it was also written in the book

113
00:11:19,918 --> 00:11:25,418
 of Nephi, which is this book

114
00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:30,752
22 And it came to pass that two hundred years had

115
00:11:30,752 --> 00:11:35,752
 passed away; and the second generation had all

116
00:11:35,752 --> 00:11:40,752
 passed away save it were a few

117
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:46,833
23 And now I, Mormon, would that ye should know

118
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:52,833
 that the people had multiplied, insomuch that they

119
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:58,833
 were spread upon all the face of the land, and that

120
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:04,833
 they had become exceedingly rich, because of

121
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:10,833
 their prosperity in Christ

122
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,663
24 And now, in this two hundred and first year

123
00:12:11,663 --> 00:12:13,263
 there began to be among them those who were lifted up

124
00:12:13,263 --> 00:12:14,863
 in pride, such as the wearing of costly apparel,

125
00:12:14,863 --> 00:12:16,463
 and all manner of fine pearls, and of the fine

126
00:12:16,463 --> 00:12:18,063
 things of the world

127
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:27,704
25 And from that time forth they did have their

128
00:12:27,704 --> 00:12:37,371
 goods and their substance no more common among them

129
00:12:37,371 --> 00:12:47,038


130
00:12:47,5 --> 00:12:52,25
26 And they began to be divided into classes; and

131
00:12:52,25 --> 00:12:57,0
 they began to build up churches unto themselves to

132
00:12:57,0 --> 00:13:01,75
 get gain, and began to deny the true church of

133
00:13:01,75 --> 00:13:06,5
 Christ

134
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:11,986
27 And it came to pass that when two hundred and

135
00:13:11,986 --> 00:13:16,986
 ten years had passed away there were many churches

136
00:13:16,986 --> 00:13:21,986
 in the land; yea, there were many churches which

137
00:13:21,986 --> 00:13:26,986
 professed to know the Christ, and yet they did deny

138
00:13:26,986 --> 00:13:31,986
 the more parts of his gospel, insomuch that they

139
00:13:31,986 --> 00:13:36,986
 did receive all manner of wickedness, and did

140
00:13:36,986 --> 00:13:41,986
 administer that which was sacred unto him to whom it

141
00:13:41,986 --> 00:13:46,986
 had been forbidden because of unworthiness

142
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:52,192
28 And this church did multiply exceedingly

143
00:13:52,192 --> 00:13:57,525
 because of iniquity, and because of the power of Satan

144
00:13:57,525 --> 00:14:02,858
 who did get hold upon their hearts

145
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:07,476
29 And again, there was another church which

146
00:14:07,476 --> 00:14:12,143
 denied the Christ; and they did persecute the true

147
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:16,81
 church of Christ, because of their humility and their

148
00:14:16,81 --> 00:14:21,477
 belief in Christ; and they did despise them

149
00:14:21,477 --> 00:14:26,144
 because of the many miracles which were wrought among

150
00:14:26,144 --> 00:14:30,811
 them

151
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:35,669
30 Therefore they did exercise power and authority

152
00:14:35,669 --> 00:14:41,169
 over the disciples of Jesus who did tarry with

153
00:14:41,169 --> 00:14:46,669
 them, and they did cast them into prison; but by the

154
00:14:46,669 --> 00:14:52,169
 power of the word of God, which was in them, the

155
00:14:52,169 --> 00:14:57,669
 prisons were rent in twain, and they went forth

156
00:14:57,669 --> 00:15:03,169
 doing mighty miracles among them

157
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:09,903
31 Nevertheless, and notwithstanding all these

158
00:15:09,903 --> 00:15:16,403
 miracles, the people did harden their hearts, and did

159
00:15:16,403 --> 00:15:22,903
 seek to kill them, even as the Jews at Jerusalem

160
00:15:22,903 --> 00:15:29,403
 sought to kill Jesus, according to his word

161
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:36,128
32 And they did cast them into furnaces of fire,

162
00:15:36,128 --> 00:15:43,128
 and they came forth receiving no harm

163
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:50,126
33 And they also cast them into dens of wild

164
00:15:50,126 --> 00:15:56,376
 beasts, and they did play with the wild beasts even as

165
00:15:56,376 --> 00:16:02,626
 a child with a lamb; and they did come forth from

166
00:16:02,626 --> 00:16:08,876
 among them, receiving no harm

167
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:14,884
34 Nevertheless, the people did harden their

168
00:16:14,884 --> 00:16:21,134
 hearts, for they were led by many priests and false

169
00:16:21,134 --> 00:16:27,384
 prophets to build up many churches, and to do all

170
00:16:27,384 --> 00:16:33,634
 manner of iniquity. And they did smite upon the

171
00:16:33,634 --> 00:16:39,884
 people of Jesus; but the people of Jesus did not smite

172
00:16:39,884 --> 00:16:46,134
 again. And thus they did dwindle in unbelief and

173
00:16:46,134 --> 00:16:52,384
 wickedness, from year to year, even until two

174
00:16:52,384 --> 00:16:58,634
 hundred and thirty years had passed away

175
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:03,951
35 And now it came to pass in this year, yea, in

176
00:17:03,951 --> 00:17:09,284
 the two hundred and thirty and first year, there

177
00:17:09,284 --> 00:17:14,617
 was a great division among the people

178
00:17:14,1 --> 00:17:20,3
36 And it came to pass that in this year there

179
00:17:20,3 --> 00:17:26,5
 arose a people who were called the Nephites, and they

180
00:17:26,5 --> 00:17:32,7
 were true believers in Christ; and among them

181
00:17:32,7 --> 00:17:38,9
 there were those who were called by the

182
00:17:38,9 --> 00:17:45,1
 Lamanites—Jacobites, and Josephites, and Zoramites

183
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:51,365
37 Therefore the true believers in Christ, and the

184
00:17:51,365 --> 00:17:56,965
 true worshipers of Christ, (among whom were the

185
00:17:56,965 --> 00:18:02,565
 three disciples of Jesus who should tarry) were

186
00:18:02,565 --> 00:18:08,165
 called Nephites, and Jacobites, and Josephites, and

187
00:18:08,165 --> 00:18:13,765
 Zoramites

188
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:18,796
38 And it came to pass that they who rejected the

189
00:18:18,796 --> 00:18:24,367
 gospel were called Lamanites, and Lemuelites, and

190
00:18:24,367 --> 00:18:29,938
 Ishmaelites; and they did not dwindle in unbelief,

191
00:18:29,938 --> 00:18:35,509
 but they did wilfully rebel against the gospel of

192
00:18:35,509 --> 00:18:41,08
 Christ; and they did teach their children that

193
00:18:41,08 --> 00:18:46,651
 they should not believe, even as their fathers, from

194
00:18:46,651 --> 00:18:52,222
 the beginning, did dwindle

195
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:58,164
39 And it was because of the wickedness and

196
00:18:58,164 --> 00:19:04,164
 abomination of their fathers, even as it was in the

197
00:19:04,164 --> 00:19:10,164
 beginning. And they were taught to hate the children

198
00:19:10,164 --> 00:19:16,164
 of God, even as the Lamanites were taught to hate

199
00:19:16,164 --> 00:19:22,164
 the children of Nephi from the beginning

200
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:27,294
40 And it came to pass that two hundred and forty

201
00:19:27,294 --> 00:19:32,494
 and four years had passed away, and thus were the

202
00:19:32,494 --> 00:19:37,694
 affairs of the people. And the more wicked part of

203
00:19:37,694 --> 00:19:42,894
 the people did wax strong, and became exceedingly

204
00:19:42,894 --> 00:19:48,094
 more numerous than were the people of God

205
00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:52,854
41 And they did still continue to build up

206
00:19:52,854 --> 00:19:57,654
 churches unto themselves, and adorn them with all manner

207
00:19:57,654 --> 00:20:02,454
 of precious things. And thus did two hundred and

208
00:20:02,454 --> 00:20:07,254
 fifty years pass away, and also two hundred and

209
00:20:07,254 --> 00:20:12,054
 sixty years

210
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:17,112
42 And it came to pass that the wicked part of the

211
00:20:17,112 --> 00:20:21,779
 people began again to build up the secret oaths

212
00:20:21,779 --> 00:20:26,446
 and combinations of Gadianton

213
00:20:26,192 --> 00:20:32,192
43 And also the people who were called the people

214
00:20:32,192 --> 00:20:38,192
 of Nephi began to be proud in their hearts,

215
00:20:38,192 --> 00:20:44,192
 because of their exceeding riches, and become vain like

216
00:20:44,192 --> 00:20:50,192
 unto their brethren, the Lamanites

217
00:20:50,75 --> 00:20:57,25
44 And from this time the disciples began to

218
00:20:57,25 --> 00:21:03,75
 sorrow for the sins of the world

219
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:05,295
45 And it came to pass that when three hundred

220
00:21:05,295 --> 00:21:07,295
 years had passed away, both the people of Nephi and

221
00:21:07,295 --> 00:21:09,295
 the Lamanites had become exceedingly wicked one

222
00:21:09,295 --> 00:21:11,295
 like unto another

223
00:21:11,27 --> 00:21:19,103
46 And it came to pass that the robbers of

224
00:21:19,103 --> 00:21:26,936
 Gadianton did spread over all the face of the land; and

225
00:21:26,936 --> 00:21:34,769
 there were none that were righteous save it were

226
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:42,602
 the disciples of Jesus. And gold and silver did they

227
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:50,435
 lay up in store in abundance, and did traffic in

228
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:58,268
 all manner of traffic

229
00:21:58,15 --> 00:22:03,65
47 And it came to pass that after three hundred

230
00:22:03,65 --> 00:22:09,15
 and five years had passed away, (and the people did

231
00:22:09,15 --> 00:22:14,65
 still remain in wickedness) Amos died; and his

232
00:22:14,65 --> 00:22:20,15
 brother, Ammaron, did keep the record in his stead

233
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:25,281
48 And it came to pass that when three hundred and

234
00:22:25,281 --> 00:22:30,156
 twenty years had passed away, Ammaron, being

235
00:22:30,156 --> 00:22:35,031
 constrained by the Holy Ghost, did hide up the records

236
00:22:35,031 --> 00:22:39,906
 which were sacred—yea, even all the sacred

237
00:22:39,906 --> 00:22:44,781
 records which had been handed down from generation to

238
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:49,656
 generation, which were sacred—even until the three

239
00:22:49,656 --> 00:22:54,531
 hundred and twentieth year from the coming of

240
00:22:54,531 --> 00:22:59,406
 Christ

241
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:04,978
49 And he did hide them up unto the Lord, that

242
00:23:04,978 --> 00:23:10,378
 they might come again unto the remnant of the house

243
00:23:10,378 --> 00:23:15,778
 of Jacob, according to the prophecies and the

244
00:23:15,778 --> 00:23:21,178
 promises of the Lord. And thus is the end of the record

245
00:23:21,178 --> 00:23:26,578
 of Ammaron.
