00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
ChristAn account of the people of Nephi, according

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
to his record.Chapter 1 The Nephites and the

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Lamanites are all converted unto the

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Lord—They have all things in common, work miracles,

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and prosper in the land—After two centuries,

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
divisions, evils, false churches, and

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
persecutions arise—After three hundred years, both

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Nephites and the Lamanites are

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:08:42,
wicked—Ammaron hides up the sacred records. About A.D. 35–321. 

12
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
1 And it came to pass that the thirty and

13
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
fourth year passed away, and also the

14
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
thirty and fifth, and behold the disciples of

15
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
Jesus had formed a church of Christ in all

16
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
the lands round about. And as many as did

17
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
come unto them, and did truly repent of

18
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:42,0
their sins, were baptized in the name of

19
00:08:42,0 --> 00:08:14,
Jesus; and they did also receive the Holy Ghost.

20
00:08:14,0 --> 00:08:14,0
2 And it came to pass in the thirty

21
00:08:14,0 --> 00:08:14,0
and sixth year, the people were all

22
00:08:14,0 --> 00:08:14,0
converted unto the Lord, upon all the

23
00:08:14,0 --> 00:08:14,0
face of the land, both Nephites and

24
00:08:14,0 --> 00:08:14,0
Lamanites, and there were no

25
00:08:14,0 --> 00:08:14,0
contentions and disputations among them, and

26
00:08:14,0 --> 00:10:26,
every man did deal justly one with another.

27
00:10:26,0 --> 00:10:26,0
3 And they had all things common

28
00:10:26,0 --> 00:10:26,0
among them; therefore there

29
00:10:26,0 --> 00:10:26,0
were not rich and poor, bond and

30
00:10:26,0 --> 00:10:26,0
free, but they were all made free,

31
00:10:26,0 --> 00:19:35,
and partakers of the heavenly gift.

32
00:19:35,0 --> 00:19:35,0
4 And it came to pass that the

33
00:19:35,0 --> 00:19:35,0
thirty and seventh year

34
00:19:35,0 --> 00:19:35,0
passed away also, and there still

35
00:19:35,0 --> 00:37:42,
continued to be peace in the land.

36
00:37:42,0 --> 00:37:42,0
5 And there were great and

37
00:37:42,0 --> 00:37:42,0
marvelous works wrought by

38
00:37:42,0 --> 00:37:42,0
the disciples of Jesus,

39
00:37:42,0 --> 00:37:42,0
insomuch that they did heal the

40
00:37:42,0 --> 00:37:42,0
sick, and raise the dead, and

41
00:37:42,0 --> 00:37:42,0
cause the lame to walk, and

42
00:37:42,0 --> 00:37:42,0
the blind to receive their

43
00:37:42,0 --> 00:37:42,0
sight, and the deaf to hear;

44
00:37:42,0 --> 00:37:42,0
and all manner of miracles

45
00:37:42,0 --> 00:37:42,0
did they work among the

46
00:37:42,0 --> 00:37:42,0
children of men; and in nothing

47
00:37:42,0 --> 00:37:42,0
did they work miracles save

48
00:37:42,0 --> 00:38:54,
it were in the name of Jesus.

49
00:38:54,0 --> 00:38:54,0
6 And thus did the thirty

50
00:38:54,0 --> 00:38:54,0
and eighth year pass away,

51
00:38:54,0 --> 00:38:54,0
and also the thirty and

52
00:38:54,0 --> 00:38:54,0
ninth, and forty and first, and

53
00:38:54,0 --> 00:38:54,0
the forty and second, yea,

54
00:38:54,0 --> 00:38:54,0
even until forty and nine

55
00:38:54,0 --> 00:38:54,0
years had passed away, and

56
00:38:54,0 --> 00:38:54,0
also the fifty and first,

57
00:38:54,0 --> 00:38:54,0
and the fifty and second;

58
00:38:54,0 --> 00:38:54,0
yea, and even until fifty and

59
00:38:54,0 --> 00:41:06,
nine years had passed away.

60
00:41:06,0 --> 00:41:06,0
7 And the Lord did

61
00:41:06,0 --> 00:41:06,0
prosper them exceedingly in

62
00:41:06,0 --> 00:41:06,0
the land; yea,

63
00:41:06,0 --> 00:41:06,0
insomuch that they did build

64
00:41:06,0 --> 00:41:06,0
cities again where there

65
00:41:06,0 --> 00:46:34,
had been cities burned.

66
00:46:34,0 --> 00:46:34,0
8 Yea, even that

67
00:46:34,0 --> 00:46:34,0
great city

68
00:46:34,0 --> 00:46:34,0
Zarahemla did they

69
00:46:34,0 --> 00:52:44,
cause to be built again.

70
00:52:44,0 --> 00:52:44,0
9 But there were

71
00:52:44,0 --> 00:52:44,0
many cities

72
00:52:44,0 --> 00:52:44,0
which had been

73
00:52:44,0 --> 00:52:44,0
sunk, and waters

74
00:52:44,0 --> 00:52:44,0
came up in the

75
00:52:44,0 --> 00:52:44,0
stead thereof;

76
00:52:44,0 --> 00:52:44,0
therefore these

77
00:52:44,0 --> 01:00:14,
cities could not be renewed.

78
01:00:14,0 --> 01:00:14,0
10 And now,

79
01:00:14,0 --> 01:00:14,0
behold, it came to

80
01:00:14,0 --> 01:00:14,0
pass that the

81
01:00:14,0 --> 01:00:14,0
people of Nephi

82
01:00:14,0 --> 01:00:14,0
did wax

83
01:00:14,0 --> 01:00:14,0
strong, and did

84
01:00:14,0 --> 01:00:14,0
multiply exceedingly

85
01:00:14,0 --> 01:00:14,0
fast, and

86
01:00:14,0 --> 01:00:14,0
became an

87
01:00:14,0 --> 01:00:14,0
exceedingly fair and

88
01:00:14,0 --> 01:09:23,
delightsome people.

89
01:09:23,0 --> 01:09:23,0
11 And they

90
01:09:23,0 --> 01:09:23,0
were married,

91
01:09:23,0 --> 01:09:23,0
and given in

92
01:09:23,0 --> 01:09:23,0
marriage, and

93
01:09:23,0 --> 01:09:23,0
were blessed

94
01:09:23,0 --> 01:09:23,0
according to the

95
01:09:23,0 --> 01:09:23,0
multitude of

96
01:09:23,0 --> 01:09:23,0
the promises

97
01:09:23,0 --> 01:09:23,0
which the Lord

98
01:09:23,0 --> 01:08:55,
had made unto them.

99
01:08:55,0 --> 01:08:55,0
12 And they

100
01:08:55,0 --> 01:08:55,0
did not walk

101
01:08:55,0 --> 01:08:55,0
any more after

102
01:08:55,0 --> 01:08:55,0
the

103
01:08:55,0 --> 01:08:55,0
performances and

104
01:08:55,0 --> 01:08:55,0
ordinances of the

105
01:08:55,0 --> 01:08:55,0
law of

106
01:08:55,0 --> 01:08:55,0
Moses; but they

107
01:08:55,0 --> 01:08:55,0
did walk after

108
01:08:55,0 --> 01:08:55,0
the

109
01:08:55,0 --> 01:08:55,0
commandments which

110
01:08:55,0 --> 01:08:55,0
they had

111
01:08:55,0 --> 01:08:55,0
received from their

112
01:08:55,0 --> 01:08:55,0
Lord and

113
01:08:55,0 --> 01:08:55,0
their God,

114
01:08:55,0 --> 01:08:55,0
continuing in

115
01:08:55,0 --> 01:08:55,0
fasting and

116
01:08:55,0 --> 01:08:55,0
prayer, and in

117
01:08:55,0 --> 01:08:55,0
meeting together

118
01:08:55,0 --> 01:08:55,0
oft both to

119
01:08:55,0 --> 01:08:55,0
pray and to

120
01:08:55,0 --> 01:12:39,
hear the word of the Lord.

121
01:12:39,0 --> 01:12:39,0
13 And it

122
01:12:39,0 --> 01:12:39,0
came to pass

123
01:12:39,0 --> 01:12:39,0
that there

124
01:12:39,0 --> 01:12:39,0
was no

125
01:12:39,0 --> 01:12:39,0
contention among

126
01:12:39,0 --> 01:12:39,0
all the

127
01:12:39,0 --> 01:12:39,0
people, in all the

128
01:12:39,0 --> 01:12:39,0
land; but

129
01:12:39,0 --> 01:12:39,0
there were

130
01:12:39,0 --> 01:12:39,0
mighty

131
01:12:39,0 --> 01:12:39,0
miracles wrought

132
01:12:39,0 --> 01:12:39,0
among the

133
01:12:39,0 --> 01:15:35,
disciples of Jesus.

134
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
14 And it

135
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
came to pass

136
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
that the

137
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
seventy and

138
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
first year

139
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
passed

140
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
away, and also

141
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
the seventy

142
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
and second

143
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
year, yea,

144
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
and in

145
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
fine, till the

146
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
seventy

147
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
and ninth

148
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
year had

149
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
passed away;

150
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
yea, even an

151
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
hundred

152
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
years had

153
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
passed away, and

154
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
the

155
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
disciples of

156
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
Jesus, whom he

157
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
had chosen,

158
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
had all

159
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
gone to the

160
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
paradise of

161
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
God, save

162
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
it were the

163
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
three who

164
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
should

165
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
tarry; and there

166
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
were other

167
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
disciples

168
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
ordained in

169
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
their

170
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
stead; and also

171
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,
many of that generation had passed away.

172
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
15 And it

173
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
came to

174
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
pass that

175
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
there was no

176
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0


177
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
contention in the

178
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
land,

179
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
because of the

180
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
love of

181
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
God which

182
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
did dwell in

183
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
the

184
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,
hearts of the people.

185
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
16 And

186
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
there were

187
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
no

188
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
envyings, nor

189
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
strifes,

190
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
nor

191
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
tumults, nor

192
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
whoredoms,

193
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
nor

194
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
lyings, nor

195
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
murders,

196
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
nor any

197
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
manner of

198
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0


199
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
lasciviousness; and

200
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
surely

201
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
there could

202
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
not be a

203
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
happier

204
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
people

205
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
among all

206
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
the people

207
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
who had

208
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,
been created by the hand of God.

209
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
17 There

210
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
were no

murderers,

214
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
neither

215
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
were

216
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
there

217
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
Lamanites,

218
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
nor any

01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
-ites;

221
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
but they

222
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
were in

223
01:15:35,0 --> 01:15:35,0
