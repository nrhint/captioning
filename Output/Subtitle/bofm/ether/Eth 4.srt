1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:08,167
Chapter 4 Moroni is commanded to seal up the

2
00:00:08,167 --> 00:00:16,334
 writings of the brother of Jared—They will not be

3
00:00:16,334 --> 00:00:24,501
 revealed until men have faith even as the brother of

4
00:00:24,501 --> 00:00:32,668
 Jared—Christ commands men to believe His words and

5
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:40,835
 those of His disciples—Men are commanded to repent,

6
00:00:40,835 --> 00:00:49,002
 believe the gospel, and be saved.

7
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:55,083
1 And the Lord commanded the brother of Jared to

8
00:00:55,083 --> 00:01:00,75
 go down out of the mount from the presence of the

9
00:01:00,75 --> 00:01:06,417
 Lord, and write the things which he had seen; and

10
00:01:06,417 --> 00:01:12,084
 they were forbidden to come unto the children of

11
00:01:12,084 --> 00:01:17,751
 men until after that he should be lifted up upon the

12
00:01:17,751 --> 00:01:23,418
 cross; and for this cause did king Mosiah keep

13
00:01:23,418 --> 00:01:29,085
 them, that they should not come unto the world until

14
00:01:29,085 --> 00:01:34,752
 after Christ should show himself unto his people

15
00:01:34,752 --> 00:01:40,419


16
00:01:40,3 --> 00:01:43,967
2 And after Christ truly had showed himself unto

17
00:01:43,967 --> 00:01:47,634
 his people he commanded that they should be made

18
00:01:47,634 --> 00:01:51,301
 manifest

19
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:56,745
3 And now, after that, they have all dwindled in

20
00:01:56,745 --> 00:02:02,145
 unbelief; and there is none save it be the

21
00:02:02,145 --> 00:02:07,545
 Lamanites, and they have rejected the gospel of Christ;

22
00:02:07,545 --> 00:02:12,945
 therefore I am commanded that I should hide them up

23
00:02:12,945 --> 00:02:18,345
 again in the earth

24
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:23,372
4 Behold, I have written upon these plates the

25
00:02:23,372 --> 00:02:28,172
 very things which the brother of Jared saw; and there

26
00:02:28,172 --> 00:02:32,972
 never were greater things made manifest than

27
00:02:32,972 --> 00:02:37,772
 those which were made manifest unto the brother of

28
00:02:37,772 --> 00:02:42,572
 Jared

29
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:47,029
5 Wherefore the Lord hath commanded me to write

30
00:02:47,029 --> 00:02:52,029
 them; and I have written them. And he commanded me

31
00:02:52,029 --> 00:02:57,029
 that I should seal them up; and he also hath

32
00:02:57,029 --> 00:03:02,029
 commanded that I should seal up the interpretation

33
00:03:02,029 --> 00:03:07,029
 thereof; wherefore I have sealed up the interpreters,

34
00:03:07,029 --> 00:03:12,029
 according to the commandment of the Lord

35
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,209
6 For the Lord said unto me: They shall not go

36
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:23,459
 forth unto the Gentiles until the day that they shall

37
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:28,709
 repent of their iniquity, and become clean before

38
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:33,959
 the Lord

39
00:03:33,38 --> 00:03:39,13
7 And in that day that they shall exercise faith

40
00:03:39,13 --> 00:03:44,88
 in me, saith the Lord, even as the brother of Jared

41
00:03:44,88 --> 00:03:50,63
 did, that they may become sanctified in me, then

42
00:03:50,63 --> 00:03:56,38
 will I manifest unto them the things which the

43
00:03:56,38 --> 00:04:02,13
 brother of Jared saw, even to the unfolding unto them

44
00:04:02,13 --> 00:04:07,88
 all my revelations, saith Jesus Christ, the Son

45
00:04:07,88 --> 00:04:13,63
 of God, the Father of the heavens and of the earth,

46
00:04:13,63 --> 00:04:19,38
 and all things that in them are

47
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:24,825
8 And he that will contend against the word of the

48
00:04:24,825 --> 00:04:30,625
 Lord, let him be accursed; and he that shall deny

49
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:36,425
 these things, let him be accursed; for unto them

50
00:04:36,425 --> 00:04:42,225
 will I show no greater things, saith Jesus Christ;

51
00:04:42,225 --> 00:04:48,025
 for I am he who speaketh

52
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:54,455
9 And at my command the heavens are opened and are

53
00:04:54,455 --> 00:04:59,955
 shut; and at my word the earth shall shake; and

54
00:04:59,955 --> 00:05:05,455
 at my command the inhabitants thereof shall pass

55
00:05:05,455 --> 00:05:10,955
 away, even so as by fire

56
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:16,927
10 And he that believeth not my words believeth

57
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:23,177
 not my disciples; and if it so be that I do not

58
00:05:23,177 --> 00:05:29,427
 speak, judge ye; for ye shall know that it is I that

59
00:05:29,427 --> 00:05:35,677
 speaketh, at the last day

60
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:42,336
11 But he that believeth these things which I have

61
00:05:42,336 --> 00:05:48,736
 spoken, him will I visit with the manifestations

62
00:05:48,736 --> 00:05:55,136
 of my Spirit, and he shall know and bear record.

63
00:05:55,136 --> 00:06:01,536
 For because of my Spirit he shall know that these

64
00:06:01,536 --> 00:06:07,936
 things are true; for it persuadeth men to do good

65
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:16,084
12 And whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do good

66
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:24,334
 is of me; for good cometh of none save it be of

67
00:06:24,334 --> 00:06:32,584
 me. I am the same that leadeth men to all good; he

68
00:06:32,584 --> 00:06:40,834
 that will not believe my words will not believe

69
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:49,084
 me—that I am; and he that will not believe me will

70
00:06:49,084 --> 00:06:57,334
 not believe the Father who sent me. For behold, I am

71
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:05,584
 the Father, I am the light, and the life, and the

72
00:07:05,584 --> 00:07:13,834
 truth of the world

73
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:19,799
13 Come unto me, O ye Gentiles, and I will show

74
00:07:19,799 --> 00:07:26,132
 unto you the greater things, the knowledge which is

75
00:07:26,132 --> 00:07:32,465
 hid up because of unbelief

76
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:37,018
14 Come unto me, O ye house of Israel, and it

77
00:07:37,018 --> 00:07:42,018
 shall be made manifest unto you how great things the

78
00:07:42,018 --> 00:07:47,018
 Father hath laid up for you, from the foundation of

79
00:07:47,018 --> 00:07:52,018
 the world; and it hath not come unto you, because

80
00:07:52,018 --> 00:07:57,018
 of unbelief

81
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:04,478
15 Behold, when ye shall rend that veil of

82
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:10,978
 unbelief which doth cause you to remain in your awful

83
00:08:10,978 --> 00:08:17,478
 state of wickedness, and hardness of heart, and

84
00:08:17,478 --> 00:08:23,978
 blindness of mind, then shall the great and marvelous

85
00:08:23,978 --> 00:08:30,478
 things which have been hid up from the foundation

86
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:36,977
 of the world from you—yea, when ye shall call upon

87
00:08:36,977 --> 00:08:43,477
 the Father in my name, with a broken heart and a

88
00:08:43,477 --> 00:08:49,977
 contrite spirit, then shall ye know that the Father

89
00:08:49,977 --> 00:08:56,477
 hath remembered the covenant which he made unto

90
00:08:56,477 --> 00:09:02,977
 your fathers, O house of Israel

91
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:08,342
16 And then shall my revelations which I have

92
00:09:08,342 --> 00:09:13,842
 caused to be written by my servant John be unfolded in

93
00:09:13,842 --> 00:09:19,342
 the eyes of all the people. Remember, when ye see

94
00:09:19,342 --> 00:09:24,842
 these things, ye shall know that the time is at

95
00:09:24,842 --> 00:09:30,342
 hand that they shall be made manifest in very deed

96
00:09:30,342 --> 00:09:35,842


97
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:40,674
17 Therefore, when ye shall receive this record ye

98
00:09:40,674 --> 00:09:46,007
 may know that the work of the Father has

99
00:09:46,007 --> 00:09:51,34
 commenced upon all the face of the land

100
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:57,825
18 Therefore, repent all ye ends of the earth, and

101
00:09:57,825 --> 00:10:03,992
 come unto me, and believe in my gospel, and be

102
00:10:03,992 --> 00:10:10,159
 baptized in my name; for he that believeth and is

103
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:16,326
 baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not

104
00:10:16,326 --> 00:10:22,493
 shall be damned; and signs shall follow them that

105
00:10:22,493 --> 00:10:28,66
 believe in my name

106
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:35,528
19 And blessed is he that is found faithful unto

107
00:10:35,528 --> 00:10:42,928
 my name at the last day, for he shall be lifted up

108
00:10:42,928 --> 00:10:50,328
 to dwell in the kingdom prepared for him from the

109
00:10:50,328 --> 00:10:57,728
 foundation of the world. And behold it is I that

110
00:10:57,728 --> 00:11:05,128
 hath spoken it. Amen.
