1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:04,667
Chapter 4 Moroni is commanded to seal up the

2
00:00:04,667 --> 00:00:09,334
writings of the brother of Jared—They will not be

3
00:00:09,334 --> 00:00:14,001
revealed until men have faith even as the

4
00:00:14,001 --> 00:00:18,668
brother of Jared—Christ commands men to believe His

5
00:00:18,668 --> 00:00:23,335
words and those of His disciples—Men are

6
00:00:23,335 --> 00:00:28,328
commanded to repent, believe the gospel, and be saved. 

7
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,55
1 And the Lord commanded the brother of

8
00:00:28,55 --> 00:00:28,772
Jared to go down out of the mount from the

9
00:00:28,772 --> 00:00:28,994
presence of the Lord, and write the things which

10
00:00:28,994 --> 00:00:29,216
he had seen; and they were forbidden to come

11
00:00:29,216 --> 00:00:29,438
unto the children of men until after that

12
00:00:29,438 --> 00:00:29,66
he should be lifted up upon the cross; and

13
00:00:29,66 --> 00:00:29,882
for this cause did king Mosiah keep them, that

14
00:00:29,882 --> 00:00:30,104
they should not come unto the world until

15
00:00:30,104 --> 00:00:30,731
after Christ should show himself unto his people.

16
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:35,731
2 And after Christ truly had showed

17
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:40,731
himself unto his people he

18
00:00:40,731 --> 00:00:45,746
commanded that they should be made manifest.

19
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:46,175
3 And now, after that, they

20
00:00:46,175 --> 00:00:46,604
have all dwindled in unbelief; and

21
00:00:46,604 --> 00:00:47,033
there is none save it be the

22
00:00:47,033 --> 00:00:47,462
Lamanites, and they have

23
00:00:47,462 --> 00:00:47,891
rejected the gospel of Christ;

24
00:00:47,891 --> 00:00:48,32
therefore I am commanded that I should

25
00:00:48,32 --> 00:00:48,148
hide them up again in the earth.

26
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:55,005
4 Behold, I have written upon

27
00:00:55,005 --> 00:01:01,862
these plates the very things

28
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:08,719
which the brother of Jared

29
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:15,576
saw; and there never were

30
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:22,433
greater things made manifest than

31
00:01:22,433 --> 00:01:29,29
those which were made

32
00:01:29,29 --> 00:01:36,463
manifest unto the brother of Jared.

33
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:36,363
5 Wherefore the Lord hath

34
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:36,263
commanded me to write them; and

35
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:36,163
I have written them. And he

36
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:36,063
commanded me that I should

37
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:35,963
seal them up; and he also hath

38
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:35,863
commanded that I should seal

39
00:01:35,863 --> 00:01:35,763
up the interpretation thereof;

40
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:35,663
wherefore I have sealed up

41
00:01:35,663 --> 00:01:35,563
the interpreters, according to

42
00:01:35,563 --> 00:01:35,529
the commandment of the Lord.

43
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:35,362
6 For the Lord said unto

44
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:35,195
me: They shall not go forth

45
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:35,028
unto the Gentiles until

46
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:34,861
the day that they shall

47
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:34,694
repent of their iniquity, and

48
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:34,594
become clean before the Lord.

49
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:34,727
7 And in that day that

50
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:34,861
they shall exercise faith

51
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:34,993
in me, saith the Lord,

52
00:01:34,993 --> 00:01:35,126
even as the brother of Jared

53
00:01:35,126 --> 00:01:35,26
did, that they may

54
00:01:35,26 --> 00:01:35,392
become sanctified in me, then

55
00:01:35,392 --> 00:01:35,525
will I manifest unto them

56
00:01:35,525 --> 00:01:35,659
the things which the

57
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:35,791
brother of Jared saw, even

58
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:35,924
to the unfolding unto them

59
00:01:35,924 --> 00:01:36,057
all my revelations,

60
00:01:36,057 --> 00:01:36,191
saith Jesus Christ, the Son

61
00:01:36,191 --> 00:01:36,323
of God, the Father of the

62
00:01:36,323 --> 00:01:36,456
heavens and of the earth,

63
00:01:36,456 --> 00:01:36,53
and all things that in them are.

64
00:01:36,53 --> 00:01:36,43
8 And he that will

65
00:01:36,43 --> 00:01:36,33
contend against the word

66
00:01:36,33 --> 00:01:36,23
of the Lord, let him

67
00:01:36,23 --> 00:01:36,13
be accursed; and he

68
00:01:36,13 --> 00:01:36,03
that shall deny these

69
00:01:36,03 --> 00:01:35,93
things, let him be

70
00:01:35,93 --> 00:01:35,83
accursed; for unto them will

71
00:01:35,83 --> 00:01:35,73
I show no greater

72
00:01:35,73 --> 00:01:35,63
things, saith Jesus

73
00:01:35,63 --> 00:01:35,596
Christ; for I am he who speaketh.

74
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:35,471
9 And at my command

75
00:01:35,471 --> 00:01:35,346
the heavens are opened

76
00:01:35,346 --> 00:01:35,221
and are shut; and at

77
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:35,096
my word the earth

78
00:01:35,096 --> 00:01:34,971
shall shake; and at my

79
00:01:34,971 --> 00:01:34,846
command the

80
00:01:34,846 --> 00:01:34,721
inhabitants thereof shall pass

81
00:01:34,721 --> 00:01:34,661
away, even so as by fire.

82
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:34,883
10 And he that

83
00:01:34,883 --> 00:01:35,105
believeth not my words

84
00:01:35,105 --> 00:01:35,327
believeth not my

85
00:01:35,327 --> 00:01:35,549
disciples; and if it

86
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:35,771
so be that I do not

87
00:01:35,771 --> 00:01:35,993
speak, judge ye;

88
00:01:35,993 --> 00:01:36,215
for ye shall know

89
00:01:36,215 --> 00:01:36,437
that it is I that

90
00:01:36,437 --> 00:01:36,129
speaketh, at the last day.

91
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:36,058
11 But he that

92
00:01:36,058 --> 00:01:35,987
believeth these

93
00:01:35,987 --> 00:01:35,916
things which I have

94
00:01:35,916 --> 00:01:35,845
spoken, him will

95
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:35,774
I visit with the

96
00:01:35,774 --> 00:01:35,703
manifestations of

97
00:01:35,703 --> 00:01:35,632
my Spirit, and

98
00:01:35,632 --> 00:01:35,561
he shall know and

99
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:35,49
bear record. For

100
00:01:35,49 --> 00:01:35,419
because of my

101
00:01:35,419 --> 00:01:35,348
Spirit he shall know

102
00:01:35,348 --> 00:01:35,277
that these

103
00:01:35,277 --> 00:01:35,206
things are true; for

104
00:01:35,206 --> 00:01:35,195
it persuadeth men to do good.

105
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:35,15
12 And

106
00:01:35,15 --> 00:01:35,105
whatsoever thing

107
00:01:35,105 --> 00:01:35,06
persuadeth men to do

108
00:01:35,06 --> 00:01:35,015
good is of me; for

109
00:01:35,015 --> 00:01:34,97
good cometh of

110
00:01:34,97 --> 00:01:34,925
none save it be

111
00:01:34,925 --> 00:01:34,88
of me. I am the

112
00:01:34,88 --> 00:01:34,835
same that leadeth

113
00:01:34,835 --> 00:01:34,79
men to all

114
00:01:34,79 --> 00:01:34,745
good; he that will

115
00:01:34,745 --> 00:01:34,7
not believe my

116
00:01:34,7 --> 00:01:34,655
words will not

117
00:01:34,655 --> 00:01:34,61
believe me—that I

118
00:01:34,61 --> 00:01:34,565
am; and he that

119
00:01:34,565 --> 00:01:34,52
will not believe

120
00:01:34,52 --> 00:01:34,475
me will not

121
00:01:34,475 --> 00:01:34,43
believe the Father

122
00:01:34,43 --> 00:01:34,385
who sent me. For

123
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:34,34
behold, I am the

124
00:01:34,34 --> 00:01:34,295
Father, I am

125
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:34,25
the light, and the

126
00:01:34,25 --> 00:01:34,261
life, and the truth of the world.

127
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:34,136
13 Come unto

128
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:34,011
me, O ye

129
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:33,886
Gentiles, and I will

130
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:33,761
show unto you the

131
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:33,636
greater

132
00:01:33,636 --> 00:01:33,511
things, the knowledge

133
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:33,386
which is hid

134
00:01:33,386 --> 00:01:33,327
up because of unbelief.

135
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:33,527
14 Come unto

136
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:33,727
me, O ye house

137
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:33,927
of Israel, and

138
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:34,127
it shall be

139
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:34,327
made manifest

140
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:34,527
unto you how

141
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:34,727
great things the

142
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:34,927
Father hath

143
00:01:34,927 --> 00:01:35,127
laid up for

144
00:01:35,127 --> 00:01:35,327
you, from the

145
00:01:35,327 --> 00:01:35,527
foundation of the

146
00:01:35,527 --> 00:01:35,727
world; and it

147
00:01:35,727 --> 00:01:35,927
hath not come

148
00:01:35,927 --> 00:01:36,127
unto you,

149
00:01:36,127 --> 00:01:36,797
because of unbelief.

150
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:37,111
15 Behold,

151
00:01:37,111 --> 00:01:37,425
when ye shall

152
00:01:37,425 --> 00:01:37,739
rend that veil

153
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:38,053
of unbelief

154
00:01:38,053 --> 00:01:38,367
which doth

155
00:01:38,367 --> 00:01:38,681
cause you to

156
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:38,995
remain in your

157
00:01:38,995 --> 00:01:39,309
awful state

158
00:01:39,309 --> 00:01:39,623
of wickedness,

159
00:01:39,623 --> 00:01:39,937
and hardness

160
00:01:39,937 --> 00:01:40,251
of heart,

161
00:01:40,251 --> 00:01:40,565
and blindness

162
00:01:40,565 --> 00:01:40,879
of mind, then

163
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:41,193
shall the

164
00:01:41,193 --> 00:01:41,507
great and

165
00:01:41,507 --> 00:01:41,821
marvelous things

166
00:01:41,821 --> 00:01:42,135
which have been

167
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:42,449
hid up from

168
00:01:42,449 --> 00:01:42,763
the

169
00:01:42,763 --> 00:01:43,077
foundation of the

170
00:01:43,077 --> 00:01:43,391
world from

171
00:01:43,391 --> 00:01:43,705
you—yea, when ye

172
00:01:43,705 --> 00:01:44,019
shall call upon

173
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:44,333
the Father

174
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:44,647
in my name,

175
00:01:44,647 --> 00:01:44,961
with a broken

176
00:01:44,961 --> 00:01:45,275
heart and a

177
00:01:45,275 --> 00:01:45,589
contrite

178
00:01:45,589 --> 00:01:45,903
spirit, then shall

179
00:01:45,903 --> 00:01:46,217
ye know that

180
00:01:46,217 --> 00:01:46,531
the Father

181
00:01:46,531 --> 00:01:46,845
hath remembered

182
00:01:46,845 --> 00:01:47,159
the covenant

183
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:47,473
which he

184
00:01:47,473 --> 00:01:47,14
made unto your fathers, O house of Israel.

185
00:01:47,14 --> 00:01:48,19
16 And then

186
00:01:48,19 --> 00:01:49,24
shall my

187
00:01:49,24 --> 00:01:50,29
revelations

188
00:01:50,29 --> 00:01:51,34
which I have

189
00:01:51,34 --> 00:01:52,39
caused to be

190
00:01:52,39 --> 00:01:53,44
written by my

191
00:01:53,44 --> 00:01:54,49
servant

192
00:01:54,49 --> 00:01:55,54
John be

193
00:01:55,54 --> 00:01:56,59
unfolded in the

194
00:01:56,59 --> 00:01:57,64
eyes of all the

195
00:01:57,64 --> 00:01:58,69
people.

196
00:01:58,69 --> 00:01:59,74
Remember, when

197
00:01:59,74 --> 00:02:00,79
ye see these

198
00:02:00,79 --> 00:02:01,84
things, ye

199
00:02:01,84 --> 00:02:02,89
shall know

200
00:02:02,89 --> 00:02:03,94
