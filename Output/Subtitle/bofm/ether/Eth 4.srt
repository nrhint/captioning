1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 4 Moroni is commanded to seal up the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
writings of the brother of Jared—They will not be

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
revealed until men have faith even as the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
brother of Jared—Christ commands men to believe His

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
words and those of His disciples—Men are

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:05:11,
commanded to repent, believe the gospel, and be saved. 

7
00:05:11,0 --> 00:05:11,0
1 And the Lord commanded the brother of

8
00:05:11,0 --> 00:05:11,0
Jared to go down out of the mount from the

9
00:05:11,0 --> 00:05:11,0
presence of the Lord, and write the things which

10
00:05:11,0 --> 00:05:11,0
he had seen; and they were forbidden to come

11
00:05:11,0 --> 00:05:11,0
unto the children of men until after that

12
00:05:11,0 --> 00:05:11,0
he should be lifted up upon the cross; and

13
00:05:11,0 --> 00:05:11,0
for this cause did king Mosiah keep them, that

14
00:05:11,0 --> 00:05:11,0
they should not come unto the world until

15
00:05:11,0 --> 00:20:53,
after Christ should show himself unto his people.

16
00:20:53,0 --> 00:20:53,0
2 And after Christ truly had showed

17
00:20:53,0 --> 00:20:53,0
himself unto his people he

18
00:20:53,0 --> 00:22:05,
commanded that they should be made manifest.

19
00:22:05,0 --> 00:22:05,0
3 And now, after that, they

20
00:22:05,0 --> 00:22:05,0
have all dwindled in unbelief; and

21
00:22:05,0 --> 00:22:05,0
there is none save it be the

22
00:22:05,0 --> 00:22:05,0
Lamanites, and they have

23
00:22:05,0 --> 00:22:05,0
rejected the gospel of Christ;

24
00:22:05,0 --> 00:22:05,0
therefore I am commanded that I should

25
00:22:05,0 --> 00:24:17,
hide them up again in the earth.

26
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
4 Behold, I have written upon

27
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
these plates the very things

28
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
which the brother of Jared

29
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
saw; and there never were

30
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
greater things made manifest than

31
00:24:17,0 --> 00:24:17,0
those which were made

32
00:24:17,0 --> 00:30:27,
manifest unto the brother of Jared.

33
00:30:27,0 --> 00:30:27,0
5 Wherefore the Lord hath

34
00:30:27,0 --> 00:30:27,0
commanded me to write them; and

35
00:30:27,0 --> 00:30:27,0
I have written them. And he

36
00:30:27,0 --> 00:30:27,0
commanded me that I should

37
00:30:27,0 --> 00:30:27,0
seal them up; and he also hath

38
00:30:27,0 --> 00:30:27,0
commanded that I should seal

39
00:30:27,0 --> 00:30:27,0
up the interpretation thereof;

40
00:30:27,0 --> 00:30:27,0
wherefore I have sealed up

41
00:30:27,0 --> 00:30:27,0
the interpreters, according to

42
00:30:27,0 --> 00:46:37,
the commandment of the Lord.

43
00:46:37,0 --> 00:46:37,0
6 For the Lord said unto

44
00:46:37,0 --> 00:46:37,0
me: They shall not go forth

45
00:46:37,0 --> 00:46:37,0
unto the Gentiles until

46
00:46:37,0 --> 00:46:37,0
the day that they shall

47
00:46:37,0 --> 00:46:37,0
repent of their iniquity, and

48
00:46:37,0 --> 00:48:49,
become clean before the Lord.

49
00:48:49,0 --> 00:48:49,0
7 And in that day that

50
00:48:49,0 --> 00:48:49,0
they shall exercise faith

51
00:48:49,0 --> 00:48:49,0
in me, saith the Lord,

52
00:48:49,0 --> 00:48:49,0
even as the brother of Jared

53
00:48:49,0 --> 00:48:49,0
did, that they may

54
00:48:49,0 --> 00:48:49,0
become sanctified in me, then

55
00:48:49,0 --> 00:48:49,0
will I manifest unto them

56
00:48:49,0 --> 00:48:49,0
the things which the

57
00:48:49,0 --> 00:48:49,0
brother of Jared saw, even

58
00:48:49,0 --> 00:48:49,0
to the unfolding unto them

59
00:48:49,0 --> 00:48:49,0
all my revelations,

60
00:48:49,0 --> 00:48:49,0
saith Jesus Christ, the Son

61
00:48:49,0 --> 00:48:49,0
of God, the Father of the

62
00:48:49,0 --> 00:48:49,0
heavens and of the earth,

63
00:48:49,0 --> 00:55:00,
and all things that in them are.

64
00:55:00,0 --> 00:55:00,0
8 And he that will

65
00:55:00,0 --> 00:55:00,0
contend against the word

66
00:55:00,0 --> 00:55:00,0
of the Lord, let him

67
00:55:00,0 --> 00:55:00,0
be accursed; and he

68
00:55:00,0 --> 00:55:00,0
that shall deny these

69
00:55:00,0 --> 00:55:00,0
things, let him be

70
00:55:00,0 --> 00:55:00,0
accursed; for unto them will

71
00:55:00,0 --> 00:55:00,0
I show no greater

72
00:55:00,0 --> 00:55:00,0
things, saith Jesus

73
00:55:00,0 --> 01:08:09,
Christ; for I am he who speaketh.

74
01:08:09,0 --> 01:08:09,0
9 And at my command

75
01:08:09,0 --> 01:08:09,0
the heavens are opened

76
01:08:09,0 --> 01:08:09,0
and are shut; and at

77
01:08:09,0 --> 01:08:09,0
my word the earth

78
01:08:09,0 --> 01:08:09,0
shall shake; and at my

79
01:08:09,0 --> 01:08:09,0
command the

80
01:08:09,0 --> 01:08:09,0
inhabitants thereof shall pass

81
01:08:09,0 --> 01:19:17,
away, even so as by fire.

82
01:19:17,0 --> 01:19:17,0
10 And he that

83
01:19:17,0 --> 01:19:17,0
believeth not my words

84
01:19:17,0 --> 01:19:17,0
believeth not my

85
01:19:17,0 --> 01:19:17,0
disciples; and if it

86
01:19:17,0 --> 01:19:17,0
so be that I do not

87
01:19:17,0 --> 01:19:17,0
speak, judge ye;

88
01:19:17,0 --> 01:19:17,0
for ye shall know

89
01:19:17,0 --> 01:19:17,0
that it is I that

90
01:19:17,0 --> 01:33:25,
speaketh, at the last day.

91
01:33:25,0 --> 01:33:25,0
11 But he that

92
01:33:25,0 --> 01:33:25,0
believeth these

93
01:33:25,0 --> 01:33:25,0
things which I have

94
01:33:25,0 --> 01:33:25,0
spoken, him will

95
01:33:25,0 --> 01:33:25,0
I visit with the

96
01:33:25,0 --> 01:33:25,0
manifestations of

97
01:33:25,0 --> 01:33:25,0
my Spirit, and

98
01:33:25,0 --> 01:33:25,0
he shall know and

99
01:33:25,0 --> 01:33:25,0
bear record. For

100
01:33:25,0 --> 01:33:25,0
because of my

101
01:33:25,0 --> 01:33:25,0
Spirit he shall know

102
01:33:25,0 --> 01:33:25,0
that these

103
01:33:25,0 --> 01:33:25,0
things are true; for

104
01:33:25,0 --> 01:36:07,
it persuadeth men to do good.

105
01:36:07,0 --> 01:36:07,0
12 And

106
01:36:07,0 --> 01:36:07,0
whatsoever thing

107
01:36:07,0 --> 01:36:07,0
persuadeth men to do

108
01:36:07,0 --> 01:36:07,0
good is of me; for

109
01:36:07,0 --> 01:36:07,0
good cometh of

110
01:36:07,0 --> 01:36:07,0
none save it be

111
01:36:07,0 --> 01:36:07,0
of me. I am the

112
01:36:07,0 --> 01:36:07,0
same that leadeth

113
01:36:07,0 --> 01:36:07,0
men to all

114
01:36:07,0 --> 01:36:07,0
good; he that will

115
01:36:07,0 --> 01:36:07,0
not believe my

116
01:36:07,0 --> 01:36:07,0
words will not

117
01:36:07,0 --> 01:36:07,0
believe me—that I

118
01:36:07,0 --> 01:36:07,0
am; and he that

119
01:36:07,0 --> 01:36:07,0
will not believe

120
01:36:07,0 --> 01:36:07,0
me will not

121
01:36:07,0 --> 01:36:07,0
believe the Father

122
01:36:07,0 --> 01:36:07,0
who sent me. For

123
01:36:07,0 --> 01:36:07,0
behold, I am the

124
01:36:07,0 --> 01:36:07,0
Father, I am

125
01:36:07,0 --> 01:36:07,0
the light, and the

126
01:36:07,0 --> 01:43:15,
life, and the truth of the world.

127
01:43:15,0 --> 01:43:15,0
13 Come unto

128
01:43:15,0 --> 01:43:15,0
me, O ye

129
01:43:15,0 --> 01:43:15,0
Gentiles, and I will

130
01:43:15,0 --> 01:43:15,0
show unto you the

131
01:43:15,0 --> 01:43:15,0
greater

132
01:43:15,0 --> 01:43:15,0
things, the knowledge

133
01:43:15,0 --> 01:43:15,0
which is hid

134
01:43:15,0 --> 01:46:25,
up because of unbelief.

135
01:46:25,0 --> 01:46:25,0
14 Come unto

136
01:46:25,0 --> 01:46:25,0
me, O ye house

137
01:46:25,0 --> 01:46:25,0
of Israel, and

138
01:46:25,0 --> 01:46:25,0
it shall be

139
01:46:25,0 --> 01:46:25,0
made manifest

140
01:46:25,0 --> 01:46:25,0
unto you how

141
01:46:25,0 --> 01:46:25,0
great things the

142
01:46:25,0 --> 01:46:25,0
Father hath

143
01:46:25,0 --> 01:46:25,0
laid up for

144
01:46:25,0 --> 01:46:25,0
you, from the

145
01:46:25,0 --> 01:46:25,0
foundation of the

146
01:46:25,0 --> 01:46:25,0
world; and it

147
01:46:25,0 --> 01:46:25,0
hath not come

148
01:46:25,0 --> 01:46:25,0
unto you,

149
01:46:25,0 --> 01:53:33,
because of unbelief.

150
01:53:33,0 --> 01:53:33,0
15 Behold,

151
01:53:33,0 --> 01:53:33,0
when ye shall

152
01:53:33,0 --> 01:53:33,0
rend that veil

153
01:53:33,0 --> 01:53:33,0
of unbelief

154
01:53:33,0 --> 01:53:33,0
which doth

155
01:53:33,0 --> 01:53:33,0
cause you to

156
01:53:33,0 --> 01:53:33,0
remain in your

157
01:53:33,0 --> 01:53:33,0
awful state

158
01:53:33,0 --> 01:53:33,0
of wickedness,

159
01:53:33,0 --> 01:53:33,0
and hardness

160
01:53:33,0 --> 01:53:33,0
of heart,

161
01:53:33,0 --> 01:53:33,0
and blindness

162
01:53:33,0 --> 01:53:33,0
of mind, then

163
01:53:33,0 --> 01:53:33,0
shall the

164
01:53:33,0 --> 01:53:33,0
great and

165
01:53:33,0 --> 01:53:33,0
marvelous things

166
01:53:33,0 --> 01:53:33,0
which have been

167
01:53:33,0 --> 01:53:33,0
hid up from

168
01:53:33,0 --> 01:53:33,0
the

169
01:53:33,0 --> 01:53:33,0
foundation of the

170
01:53:33,0 --> 01:53:33,0
world from

171
01:53:33,0 --> 01:53:33,0
you—yea, when ye

172
01:53:33,0 --> 01:53:33,0
shall call upon

173
01:53:33,0 --> 01:53:33,0
the Father

174
01:53:33,0 --> 01:53:33,0
in my name,

175
01:53:33,0 --> 01:53:33,0
with a broken

176
01:53:33,0 --> 01:53:33,0
heart and a

177
01:53:33,0 --> 01:53:33,0
contrite

178
01:53:33,0 --> 01:53:33,0
spirit, then shall

179
01:53:33,0 --> 01:53:33,0
ye know that

180
01:53:33,0 --> 01:53:33,0
the Father

181
01:53:33,0 --> 01:53:33,0
hath remembered

182
01:53:33,0 --> 01:53:33,0
the covenant

183
01:53:33,0 --> 01:53:33,0
which he

184
01:53:33,0 --> 02:00:28,
made unto your fathers, O house of Israel.

185
02:00:28,0 --> 02:00:28,0
16 And then

186
02:00:28,0 --> 02:00:28,0
shall my

187
02:00:28,0 --> 02:00:28,0
revelations

188
02:00:28,0 --> 02:00:28,0
which I have

189
02:00:28,0 --> 02:00:28,0
caused to be

190
02:00:28,0 --> 02:00:28,0
written by my

191
02:00:28,0 --> 02:00:28,0
servant

192
02:00:28,0 --> 02:00:28,0
John be

193
02:00:28,0 --> 02:00:28,0
unfolded in the

194
02:00:28,0 --> 02:00:28,0
eyes of all the

195
02:00:28,0 --> 02:00:28,0
people.

196
02:00:28,0 --> 02:00:28,0
Remember, when

197
02:00:28,0 --> 02:00:28,0
ye see these

198
02:00:28,0 --> 02:00:28,0
things, ye

199
02:00:28,0 --> 02:00:28,0
shall know

200
02:00:28,0 --> 02:00:28,0
that the time

201
02:00:28,0 --> 02:00:28,0
is at hand

202
02:00:28,0 --> 02:00:28,0
that they

203
02:00:28,0 --> 02:00:28,0
shall be made

204
02:00:28,0 --> 02:08:40,
manifest in very deed.

205
02:08:40,0 --> 02:08:40,0
17

206
02:08:40,0 --> 02:08:40,0
Therefore, when ye

207
02:08:40,0 --> 02:08:40,0
shall receive

208
02:08:40,0 --> 02:08:40,0
this record

209
02:08:40,0 --> 02:08:40,0
ye may know

210
02:08:40,0 --> 02:08:40,0
that the

211
02:08:40,0 --> 02:08:40,0
work of the

212
02:08:40,0 --> 02:08:40,0
Father has

213
02:08:40,0 --> 02:08:40,0
commenced upon

214
02:08:40,0 --> 02:08:40,0
all the face

215
02:08:40,0 --> 02:15:48,
of the land.

216
02:15:48,0 --> 02:15:48,0
18

217
02:15:48,0 --> 02:15:48,0
Therefore, repent

218
02:15:48,0 --> 02:15:48,0
all ye ends

219
02:15:48,0 --> 02:15:48,0
of the

220
02:15:48,0 --> 02:15:48,0
earth, and come

221
02:15:48,0 --> 02:15:48,0

222
02:15:48,0 --> 02:15:48,0
and believe

223
02:15:48,0 --> 02:15:48,0
in my

224
02:15:48,0 --> 02:15:48,0
gospel, and be

226
02:15:48,0 --> 02:15:48,0
my name;

227
02:15:48,0 --> 02:15:48,0
for he that

228

saved; but

232
02:15:48,0 --> 02:15:48,0
he that

233

02:15:48,0 --> 02:15:48,0
shall be

235
02:15:48,0 --> 02:15:48,0
damned; and

236
02:15:48,0 --> 02:15:48,0
signs shall

237
02:15:48,0 --> 02:15:48,0
follow

238
02:15:48,0 --> 02:28:56,
them that believe in my name.

239
02:28:56,0 --> 02:28:56,0
19 And

240
02:28:56,0 --> 02:28:56,0
blessed is he

241
02:28:56,0 --> 02:28:56,0
that is

242
02:28:56,0 --> 02:28:56,0

243
02:28:56,0 --> 02:28:56,0
faithful unto

244
02:28:56,0 --> 02:28:56,0
my name at

245
02:28:56,0 --> 02:28:56,0
the last

246
02:28:56,0 --> 02:28:56,0
day, for he

247
02:28:56,0 --> 02:28:56,0
shall be

248
02:28:56,0 --> 02:28:56,0
lifted up

249
02:28:56,0 --> 02:28:56,0
to dwell

250
02:28:56,0 --> 02:28:56,0
in the

251
02:28:56,0 --> 02:28:56,0
kingdom

252
02:28:56,0 --> 02:28:56,0
prepared for him

253
02:28:56,0 --> 02:28:56,0
from the

254
02:28:56,0 --> 02:28:56,0
foundation

255
02:28:56,0 --> 02:28:56,0
of the

256
02:28:56,0 --> 02:28:56,0
world. And

257
02:28:56,0 --> 02:28:56,0
behold it

258
02:28:56,0 --> 02:28:56,0
is I that

259
02:28:56,0 --> 02:34:07,
hath spoken it. Amen.
