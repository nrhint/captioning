00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 2 The Jaredites prepare for their journey

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
to a promised land—It is a choice land whereon

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
men must serve Christ or be swept off—The Lord

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
talks to the brother of Jared for three hours—The

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Jaredites build barges—The Lord asks the brother of

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:03:45,
Jared to propose how the barges will be lighted. 

7
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
1 And it came to pass that Jared and his

8
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
brother, and their families, and also the

9
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
friends of Jared and his brother and their

10
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
families, went down into the valley which was

11
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
northward, (and the name of the valley was

12
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
Nimrod, being called after the mighty

13
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
hunter) with their flocks which they had

14
00:03:45,0 --> 00:04:57,
gathered together, male and female, of every kind.

15
00:04:57,0 --> 00:04:57,0
2 And they did also lay snares and

16
00:04:57,0 --> 00:04:57,0
catch fowls of the air; and they did also

17
00:04:57,0 --> 00:04:57,0
prepare a vessel, in which they did

18
00:04:57,0 --> 00:11:07,
carry with them the fish of the waters.

19
00:11:07,0 --> 00:11:07,0
3 And they did also carry with them

20
00:11:07,0 --> 00:11:07,0
deseret, which, by interpretation,

21
00:11:07,0 --> 00:11:07,0
is a honey bee; and thus they did

22
00:11:07,0 --> 00:11:07,0
carry with them swarms of bees, and all

23
00:11:07,0 --> 00:11:07,0
manner of that which was upon the

24
00:11:07,0 --> 00:10:39,
face of the land, seeds of every kind.

25
00:10:39,0 --> 00:10:39,0
4 And it came to pass that when

26
00:10:39,0 --> 00:10:39,0
they had come down into the

27
00:10:39,0 --> 00:10:39,0
valley of Nimrod the Lord came down

28
00:10:39,0 --> 00:10:39,0
and talked with the brother of

29
00:10:39,0 --> 00:10:39,0
Jared; and he was in a cloud, and

30
00:10:39,0 --> 00:12:51,
the brother of Jared saw him not.

31
00:12:51,0 --> 00:12:51,0
5 And it came to pass that the

32
00:12:51,0 --> 00:12:51,0
Lord commanded them that they

33
00:12:51,0 --> 00:12:51,0
should go forth into the

34
00:12:51,0 --> 00:12:51,0
wilderness, yea, into that quarter

35
00:12:51,0 --> 00:12:51,0
where there never had man

36
00:12:51,0 --> 00:12:51,0
been. And it came to pass that

37
00:12:51,0 --> 00:12:51,0
the Lord did go before them, and

38
00:12:51,0 --> 00:12:51,0
did talk with them as he

39
00:12:51,0 --> 00:12:51,0
stood in a cloud, and gave

40
00:12:51,0 --> 00:18:02,
directions whither they should travel.

41
00:18:02,0 --> 00:18:02,0
6 And it came to pass that

42
00:18:02,0 --> 00:18:02,0
they did travel in the

43
00:18:02,0 --> 00:18:02,0
wilderness, and did build barges,

44
00:18:02,0 --> 00:18:02,0
in which they did cross many

45
00:18:02,0 --> 00:18:02,0
waters, being directed

46
00:18:02,0 --> 00:20:44,
continually by the hand of the Lord.

47
00:20:44,0 --> 00:20:44,0
7 And the Lord would not

48
00:20:44,0 --> 00:20:44,0
suffer that they should

49
00:20:44,0 --> 00:20:44,0
stop beyond the sea in the

50
00:20:44,0 --> 00:20:44,0
wilderness, but he would

51
00:20:44,0 --> 00:20:44,0
that they should come

52
00:20:44,0 --> 00:20:44,0
forth even unto the land of

53
00:20:44,0 --> 00:20:44,0
promise, which was

54
00:20:44,0 --> 00:20:44,0
choice above all other lands,

55
00:20:44,0 --> 00:20:44,0
which the Lord God had

56
00:20:44,0 --> 00:24:15,
preserved for a righteous people.

57
00:24:15,0 --> 00:24:15,0
8 And he had sworn in

58
00:24:15,0 --> 00:24:15,0
his wrath unto the brother

59
00:24:15,0 --> 00:24:15,0
of Jared, that whoso

60
00:24:15,0 --> 00:24:15,0
should possess this land

61
00:24:15,0 --> 00:24:15,0
of promise, from that

62
00:24:15,0 --> 00:24:15,0
time henceforth and

63
00:24:15,0 --> 00:24:15,0
forever, should serve him, the

64
00:24:15,0 --> 00:24:15,0
true and only God, or

65
00:24:15,0 --> 00:24:15,0
they should be swept off

66
00:24:15,0 --> 00:24:15,0
when the fulness of his

67
00:24:15,0 --> 00:23:47,
wrath should come upon them.

68
00:23:47,0 --> 00:23:47,0
9 And now, we can

69
00:23:47,0 --> 00:23:47,0
behold the decrees of God

70
00:23:47,0 --> 00:23:47,0
concerning this land,

71
00:23:47,0 --> 00:23:47,0
that it is a land of

72
00:23:47,0 --> 00:23:47,0
promise; and whatsoever

73
00:23:47,0 --> 00:23:47,0
nation shall possess it

74
00:23:47,0 --> 00:23:47,0
shall serve God, or they

75
00:23:47,0 --> 00:23:47,0
shall be swept off when

76
00:23:47,0 --> 00:23:47,0
the fulness of his

77
00:23:47,0 --> 00:23:47,0
wrath shall come upon them.

78
00:23:47,0 --> 00:23:47,0
And the fulness of his

79
00:23:47,0 --> 00:23:47,0
wrath cometh upon them

80
00:23:47,0 --> 00:24:59,
when they are ripened in iniquity.

81
00:24:59,0 --> 00:24:59,0
10 For behold, this

82
00:24:59,0 --> 00:24:59,0
is a land which is

83
00:24:59,0 --> 00:24:59,0
choice above all other

84
00:24:59,0 --> 00:24:59,0
lands; wherefore he

85
00:24:59,0 --> 00:24:59,0
that doth possess it

86
00:24:59,0 --> 00:24:59,0
shall serve God or

87
00:24:59,0 --> 00:24:59,0
shall be swept off; for

88
00:24:59,0 --> 00:24:59,0
it is the everlasting

89
00:24:59,0 --> 00:24:59,0
decree of God. And it

90
00:24:59,0 --> 00:24:59,0
is not until the

91
00:24:59,0 --> 00:24:59,0
fulness of iniquity

92
00:24:59,0 --> 00:24:59,0
among the children of the

93
00:24:59,0 --> 00:31:40,
land, that they are swept off.

94
00:31:40,0 --> 00:31:40,0
11 And this cometh

95
00:31:40,0 --> 00:31:40,0
unto you, O ye

96
00:31:40,0 --> 00:31:40,0
Gentiles, that ye may

97
00:31:40,0 --> 00:31:40,0
know the decrees of

98
00:31:40,0 --> 00:31:40,0
God—that ye may

99
00:31:40,0 --> 00:31:40,0
repent, and not

100
00:31:40,0 --> 00:31:40,0
continue in your

101
00:31:40,0 --> 00:31:40,0
iniquities until the

102
00:31:40,0 --> 00:31:40,0
fulness come, that ye may

103
00:31:40,0 --> 00:31:40,0
not bring down the

104
00:31:40,0 --> 00:31:40,0
fulness of the

105
00:31:40,0 --> 00:31:40,0
wrath of God upon you

106
00:31:40,0 --> 00:31:40,0
as the inhabitants

107
00:31:40,0 --> 00:43:51,
of the land have hitherto done.

108
00:43:51,0 --> 00:43:51,0
12 Behold, this is

109
00:43:51,0 --> 00:43:51,0
a choice land,

110
00:43:51,0 --> 00:43:51,0
and whatsoever

111
00:43:51,0 --> 00:43:51,0
nation shall possess it

112
00:43:51,0 --> 00:43:51,0
shall be free

113
00:43:51,0 --> 00:43:51,0
from bondage, and

114
00:43:51,0 --> 00:43:51,0
from captivity, and

115
00:43:51,0 --> 00:43:51,0
from all other

116
00:43:51,0 --> 00:43:51,0
nations under heaven,

117
00:43:51,0 --> 00:43:51,0
if they will but

118
00:43:51,0 --> 00:43:51,0
serve the God of

119
00:43:51,0 --> 00:43:51,0
the land, who is

120
00:43:51,0 --> 00:43:51,0
Jesus Christ, who

121
00:43:51,0 --> 00:43:51,0
hath been manifested

122
00:43:51,0 --> 00:43:51,0
by the things

123
00:43:51,0 --> 00:53:01,
which we have written.

124
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
13 And now I

125
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
proceed with my

126
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
record; for behold, it

127
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
came to pass

128
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
that the Lord did

129
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
bring Jared and his

130
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
brethren forth

131
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
even to that great

132
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
sea which

133
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
divideth the lands. And

134
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
as they came to

135
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
the sea they

136
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
pitched their tents;

137
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
and they called

138
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
the name of the

139
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
place Moriancumer;

140
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
and they dwelt in

141
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
tents, and dwelt

142
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
in tents upon

143
00:53:01,0 --> 00:53:01,0
the seashore for

144
00:53:01,0 --> 01:01:42,
the space of four years.

145
01:01:42,0 --> 01:01:42,0
14 And it came

146
01:01:42,0 --> 01:01:42,0
to pass at the

147
01:01:42,0 --> 01:01:42,0
end of four years

148
01:01:42,0 --> 01:01:42,0
that the Lord

149
01:01:42,0 --> 01:01:42,0
came again unto

150
01:01:42,0 --> 01:01:42,0
the brother of

151
01:01:42,0 --> 01:01:42,0
Jared, and stood in

152
01:01:42,0 --> 01:01:42,0
a cloud and

153
01:01:42,0 --> 01:01:42,0
talked with him.

154
01:01:42,0 --> 01:01:42,0
And for the space

155
01:01:42,0 --> 01:01:42,0
of three hours

156
01:01:42,0 --> 01:01:42,0
did the Lord talk

157
01:01:42,0 --> 01:01:42,0
with the

158
01:01:42,0 --> 01:01:42,0
brother of Jared, and

159
01:01:42,0 --> 01:01:42,0
chastened him

160
01:01:42,0 --> 01:01:42,0
because he

161
01:01:42,0 --> 01:01:42,0
remembered not to call

162
01:01:42,0 --> 01:01:14,
upon the name of the Lord.

163
01:01:14,0 --> 01:01:14,0
15 And the

164
01:01:14,0 --> 01:01:14,0
brother of Jared

165
01:01:14,0 --> 01:01:14,0
repented of the

166
01:01:14,0 --> 01:01:14,0
evil which he

167
01:01:14,0 --> 01:01:14,0
had done, and did

168
01:01:14,0 --> 01:01:14,0
call upon the

169
01:01:14,0 --> 01:01:14,0
name of the

170
01:01:14,0 --> 01:01:14,0
Lord for his

171
01:01:14,0 --> 01:01:14,0
brethren who were

172
01:01:14,0 --> 01:01:14,0
with him. And the

173
01:01:14,0 --> 01:01:14,0
Lord said unto

174
01:01:14,0 --> 01:01:14,0
him: I will

175
01:01:14,0 --> 01:01:14,0
forgive thee and

176
01:01:14,0 --> 01:01:14,0
thy brethren of

177
01:01:14,0 --> 01:01:14,0
their sins;

178
01:01:14,0 --> 01:01:14,0
but thou shalt

179
01:01:14,0 --> 01:01:14,0
not sin any more,

180
01:01:14,0 --> 01:01:14,0
for ye shall

181
01:01:14,0 --> 01:01:14,0
remember that my

182
01:01:14,0 --> 01:01:14,0
Spirit will

183
01:01:14,0 --> 01:01:14,0
not always strive

184
01:01:14,0 --> 01:01:14,0
with man;

185
01:01:14,0 --> 01:01:14,0
wherefore, if ye

186
01:01:14,0 --> 01:01:14,0
will sin until ye

187
01:01:14,0 --> 01:01:14,0
are fully ripe

188
01:01:14,0 --> 01:01:14,0
ye shall be

189
01:01:14,0 --> 01:01:14,0
cut off from the

190
01:01:14,0 --> 01:01:14,0
presence of the

191
01:01:14,0 --> 01:01:14,0
Lord. And

192
01:01:14,0 --> 01:01:14,0
these are my

193
01:01:14,0 --> 01:01:14,0
thoughts upon the

194
01:01:14,0 --> 01:01:14,0
land which I shall

195
01:01:14,0 --> 01:01:14,0
give you for

196
01:01:14,0 --> 01:01:14,0
your

197
01:01:14,0 --> 01:01:14,0
inheritance; for it shall

198
01:01:14,0 --> 01:02:26,
be a land choice above all other lands.

199
01:02:26,0 --> 01:02:26,0
16 And the

200
01:02:26,0 --> 01:02:26,0
Lord said: Go to

201
01:02:26,0 --> 01:02:26,0
work and

202
01:02:26,0 --> 01:02:26,0
build, after the

203
01:02:26,0 --> 01:02:26,0
manner of barges

204
01:02:26,0 --> 01:02:26,0
which ye have

205
01:02:26,0 --> 01:02:26,0
hitherto

206
01:02:26,0 --> 01:02:26,0
built. And it came

207
01:02:26,0 --> 01:02:26,0
to pass that

208
01:02:26,0 --> 01:02:26,0
the brother of

209
01:02:26,0 --> 01:02:26,0
Jared did go

210
01:02:26,0 --> 01:02:26,0
to work, and

211
01:02:26,0 --> 01:02:26,0
also his

212
01:02:26,0 --> 01:02:26,0
brethren, and built

213
01:02:26,0 --> 01:02:26,0
barges after

214
01:02:26,0 --> 01:02:26,0
the manner

215
01:02:26,0 --> 01:02:26,0
which they had

216
01:02:26,0 --> 01:02:26,0
built, according

217
01:02:26,0 --> 01:02:26,0
to the

218
01:02:26,0 --> 01:02:26,0
instructions of the

219
01:02:26,0 --> 01:02:26,0
Lord. And they

220
01:02:26,0 --> 01:02:26,0
were small,

221
01:02:26,0 --> 01:02:26,0
and they were

222
01:02:26,0 --> 01:02:26,0
light upon the

223
01:02:26,0 --> 01:02:26,0
water, even

224
01:02:26,0 --> 01:02:26,0
like unto the

225
01:02:26,0 --> 01:07:37,
lightness of a fowl upon the water.

226
01:07:37,0 --> 01:07:37,0
17 And they

227
01:07:37,0 --> 01:07:37,0
were built

228
01:07:37,0 --> 01:07:37,0
after a manner

229
01:07:37,0 --> 01:07:37,0
that they were

230
01:07:37,0 --> 01:07:37,0
exceedingly

231
01:07:37,0 --> 01:07:37,0
tight, even

232
01:07:37,0 --> 01:07:37,0
that they

233
01:07:37,0 --> 01:07:37,0
would hold water

234
01:07:37,0 --> 01:07:37,0
like unto a

235
01:07:37,0 --> 01:07:37,0
dish; and the

236
01:07:37,0 --> 01:07:37,0
bottom

237
01:07:37,0 --> 01:07:37,0
thereof was tight

238
01:07:37,0 --> 01:07:37,0
like unto a

239
01:07:37,0 --> 01:07:37,0
dish; and the

240
01:07:37,0 --> 01:07:37,0
sides thereof

241
01:07:37,0 --> 01:07:37,0
were tight

242
01:07:37,0 --> 01:07:37,0
like unto a

243
01:07:37,0 --> 01:07:37,0
dish; and the

244
01:07:37,0 --> 01:07:37,0
ends thereof

245
01:07:37,0 --> 01:07:37,0
were peaked;

246
01:07:37,0 --> 01:07:37,0
and the top

247
01:07:37,0 --> 01:07:37,0
thereof was

248
01:07:37,0 --> 01:07:37,0
tight like unto a

249
01:07:37,0 --> 01:07:37,0
dish; and

250
01:07:37,0 --> 01:07:37,0
the length

251
01:07:37,0 --> 01:07:37,0
thereof was the

252
01:07:37,0 --> 01:07:37,0
length of a

253
01:07:37,0 --> 01:07:37,0
tree; and the

254
01:07:37,0 --> 01:07:37,0
door thereof,

255
01:07:37,0 --> 01:07:37,0
when it was

256
01:07:37,0 --> 01:19:06,
shut, was tight like unto a dish.

257
01:19:06,0 --> 01:19:06,0
18 And it

258
01:19:06,0 --> 01:19:06,0
came to pass

259
01:19:06,0 --> 01:19:06,0
that the

260
01:19:06,0 --> 01:19:06,0
brother of Jared

261
01:19:06,0 --> 01:19:06,0
cried unto

262
01:19:06,0 --> 01:19:06,0
the Lord,

263
01:19:06,0 --> 01:19:06,0
saying: O

264
01:19:06,0 --> 01:19:06,0
Lord, I have

265
01:19:06,0 --> 01:19:06,0
performed the

266
01:19:06,0 --> 01:19:06,0
work which

267
01:19:06,0 --> 01:19:06,0
thou hast

268
01:19:06,0 --> 01:19:06,0
commanded me,

269
01:19:06,0 --> 01:19:06,0
and I have

270
01:19:06,0 --> 01:19:06,0
made the barges

271
01:19:06,0 --> 01:19:06,0
according

272
01:19:06,0 --> 01:26:14,
as thou hast directed me.

273
01:26:14,0 --> 01:26:14,0
19 And

274
01:26:14,0 --> 01:26:14,0
behold, O Lord,

275
01:26:14,0 --> 01:26:14,0
in them

276
01:26:14,0 --> 01:26:14,0
there is no

277
01:26:14,0 --> 01:26:14,0
light;

278
01:26:14,0 --> 01:26:14,0
whither shall we

279
01:26:14,0 --> 01:26:14,0
steer? And

280
01:26:14,0 --> 01:26:14,0
also we

281
01:26:14,0 --> 01:26:14,0
shall perish,

282
01:26:14,0 --> 01:26:14,0
for in

283
01:26:14,0 --> 01:26:14,0
them we cannot

284
01:26:14,0 --> 01:26:14,0
breathe,

285
01:26:14,0 --> 01:26:14,0
save it is

286
01:26:14,0 --> 01:26:14,0
the air

287
01:26:14,0 --> 01:26:14,0
which is in

288
01:26:14,0 --> 01:26:14,0
them;

289
01:26:14,0 --> 01:35:24,
therefore we shall perish.

290
01:35:24,0 --> 01:35:24,0
20 And the

291
01:35:24,0 --> 01:35:24,0
Lord said

292
01:35:24,0 --> 01:35:24,0
unto the

293
01:35:24,0 --> 01:35:24,0
brother of

294
01:35:24,0 --> 01:35:24,0
Jared:

295
01:35:24,0 --> 01:35:24,0
Behold, thou

296
01:35:24,0 --> 01:35:24,0
shalt

297
01:35:24,0 --> 01:35:24,0
make a hole

298
01:35:24,0 --> 01:35:24,0
in the top,

299
01:35:24,0 --> 01:35:24,0
and also

300
01:35:24,0 --> 01:35:24,0
in the

301
01:35:24,0 --> 01:35:24,0
bottom; and

302
01:35:24,0 --> 01:35:24,0
when thou

303
01:35:24,0 --> 01:35:24,0
shalt

304
01:35:24,0 --> 01:35:24,0
suffer for air

305
01:35:24,0 --> 01:35:24,0
thou shalt

306
01:35:24,0 --> 01:35:24,0
unstop

307
01:35:24,0 --> 01:35:24,0
the hole and

308
01:35:24,0 --> 01:35:24,0
receive

309
01:35:24,0 --> 01:35:24,0
air. And if

310
01:35:24,0 --> 01:35:24,0
it be so

311
01:35:24,0 --> 01:35:24,0
that the

312
01:35:24,0 --> 01:35:24,0
water come

313
01:35:24,0 --> 01:35:24,0
in upon

314
01:35:24,0 --> 01:35:24,0
thee,

315
01:35:24,0 --> 01:35:24,0
behold, ye shall

316
01:35:24,0 --> 01:35:24,0
stop the

317
01:35:24,0 --> 01:35:24,0
hole, that

318
01:35:24,0 --> 01:48:05,
ye may not perish in the flood.

319
01:48:05,0 --> 01:48:05,0
21 And it

320
01:48:05,0 --> 01:48:05,0
came to

321
01:48:05,0 --> 01:48:05,0
pass that

322
01:48:05,0 --> 01:48:05,0
the

323
01:48:05,0 --> 01:48:05,0
brother of

324
01:48:05,0 --> 01:48:05,0
Jared did

325
01:48:05,0 --> 01:48:05,0
so,

326
01:48:05,0 --> 01:48:05,0
according as

327
01:48:05,0 --> 01:48:05,0
the Lord

328
01:48:05,0 --> 02:04:01,
had commanded.

329
02:04:01,0 --> 02:04:01,0
22 And he

330
02:04:01,0 --> 02:04:01,0
cried

331
02:04:01,0 --> 02:04:01,0
again unto

332
02:04:01,0 --> 02:04:01,0
the Lord

333
02:04:01,0 --> 02:04:01,0
saying: O

334
02:04:01,0 --> 02:04:01,0
Lord,

335
02:04:01,0 --> 02:04:01,0
behold I

336
02:04:01,0 --> 02:04:01,0
have done

337
02:04:01,0 --> 02:04:01,0
even as

338
02:04:01,0 --> 02:04:01,0
thou hast

339
02:04:01,0 --> 02:04:01,0
commanded

340
02:04:01,0 --> 02:04:01,0
me; and I

341
02:04:01,0 --> 02:04:01,0
have

342
02:04:01,0 --> 02:04:01,0
prepared the

343
02:04:01,0 --> 02:04:01,0
vessels

344
02:04:01,0 --> 02:04:01,0
for my

345
02:04:01,0 --> 02:04:01,0
people, and

346
02:04:01,0 --> 02:04:01,0
behold

347
02:04:01,0 --> 02:04:01,0
there is

348
02:04:01,0 --> 02:04:01,0
no light

349
02:04:01,0 --> 02:04:01,0
in them.

350
02:04:01,0 --> 02:04:01,0
Behold, O

351
02:04:01,0 --> 02:04:01,0
Lord,

352
02:04:01,0 --> 02:04:01,0
wilt thou

353
02:04:01,0 --> 02:04:01,0
suffer that

354
02:04:01,0 --> 02:04:01,0
we shall

355
02:04:01,0 --> 02:04:01,0
cross

356
02:04:01,0 --> 02:04:01,0
this great

357
02:04:01,0 --> 02:04:01,0
water in

358
02:04:01,0 --> 02:18:09,
darkness?

359
02:18:09,0 --> 02:18:09,0
23 And

360
02:18:09,0 --> 02:18:09,0
the Lord

361
02:18:09,0 --> 02:18:09,0
said

362
02:18:09,0 --> 02:18:09,0
unto the

363
02:18:09,0 --> 02:18:09,0
brother of

364
02:18:09,0 --> 02:18:09,0
Jared:

365
02:18:09,0 --> 02:18:09,0
What

366
02:18:09,0 --> 02:18:09,0
will ye

367
02:18:09,0 --> 02:18:09,0
that I

368
02:18:09,0 --> 02:18:09,0
should do

369
02:18:09,0 --> 02:18:09,0
that ye

370
02:18:09,0 --> 02:18:09,0
may have

371
02:18:09,0 --> 02:18:09,0
light in

372
02:18:09,0 --> 02:18:09,0
your

373
02:18:09,0 --> 02:18:09,0
vessels?

374
02:18:09,0 --> 02:18:09,0
For

375
02:18:09,0 --> 02:18:09,0
behold, ye

376
02:18:09,0 --> 02:18:09,0
cannot have

377
02:18:09,0 --> 02:18:09,0


378
02:18:09,0 --> 02:18:09,0
windows, for

379
02:18:09,0 --> 02:18:09,0
they will

380
02:18:09,0 --> 02:18:09,0
be

381
02:18:09,0 --> 02:18:09,0
dashed in

382
02:18:09,0 --> 02:18:09,0
pieces;

383
02:18:09,0 --> 02:18:09,0
neither

384
02:18:09,0 --> 02:18:09,0
shall ye

385
02:18:09,0 --> 02:18:09,0
take fire

386
02:18:09,0 --> 02:18:09,0
with

387
02:18:09,0 --> 02:18:09,0
you, for ye

388
02:18:09,0 --> 02:25:17,
shall not go by the light of fire.

389
02:25:17,0 --> 02:25:17,0
24 For

390
02:25:17,0 --> 02:25:17,0
behold,

391
02:25:17,0 --> 02:25:17,0
ye

392
02:25:17,0 --> 02:25:17,0
shall be

393
02:25:17,0 --> 02:25:17,0
as a

394
02:25:17,0 --> 02:25:17,0
whale in

395
02:25:17,0 --> 02:25:17,0
the

396
02:25:17,0 --> 02:25:17,0
midst of

397
02:25:17,0 --> 02:25:17,0
the sea;

398
02:25:17,0 --> 02:25:17,0
for the

399
02:25:17,0 --> 02:25:17,0


400
02:25:17,0 --> 02:25:17,0
mountain

401
02:25:17,0 --> 02:25:17,0
waves shall

402
02:25:17,0 --> 02:25:17,0
dash

403
02:25:17,0 --> 02:25:17,0
upon

404
02:25:17,0 --> 02:25:17,0
you.

405
02:25:17,0 --> 02:25:17,0


406
02:25:17,0 --> 02:25:17,0
Nevertheless, I

407
02:25:17,0 --> 02:25:17,0
will bring

408
02:25:17,0 --> 02:25:17,0
you up

409
02:25:17,0 --> 02:25:17,0
again

410
02:25:17,0 --> 02:25:17,0
out of

411
02:25:17,0 --> 02:25:17,0
the

412
02:25:17,0 --> 02:25:17,0
depths of

413
02:25:17,0 --> 02:25:17,0
the

414
02:25:17,0 --> 02:25:17,0
sea; for

415
02:25:17,0 --> 02:25:17,0
the

416
02:25:17,0 --> 02:25:17,0
winds have

417
02:25:17,0 --> 02:25:17,0
gone

418
02:25:17,0 --> 02:25:17,0
forth out

419
02:25:17,0 --> 02:25:17,0
of my

420
02:25:17,0 --> 02:25:17,0
mouth,

421
02:25:17,0 --> 02:25:17,0
and

422
02:25:17,0 --> 02:25:17,0
also the

423
02:25:17,0 --> 02:39:25,
rains and the floods have I sent forth.

424
02:39:25,0 --> 02:39:25,0
25 And

425
02:39:25,0 --> 02:39:25,0


426
02:39:25,0 --> 02:39:25,0
behold, I

427
02:39:25,0 --> 02:39:25,0
prepare

428
02:39:25,0 --> 02:39:25,0
you

429
02:39:25,0 --> 02:39:25,0
against

430
02:39:25,0 --> 02:39:25,0
these

431
02:39:25,0 --> 02:39:25,0


432
02:39:25,0 --> 02:39:25,0
things; for

433
02:39:25,0 --> 02:39:25,0
ye

434
02:39:25,0 --> 02:39:25,0
cannot

435
02:39:25,0 --> 02:39:25,0
cross

436
02:39:25,0 --> 02:39:25,0
this

437
02:39:25,0 --> 02:39:25,0
great

438
02:39:25,0 --> 02:39:25,0
deep

439
02:39:25,0 --> 02:39:25,0
save I

440
02:39:25,0 --> 02:39:25,0
prepare

441
02:39:25,0 --> 02:39:25,0
you

442
02:39:25,0 --> 02:39:25,0
against

443
02:39:25,0 --> 02:39:25,0
the

444
02:39:25,0 --> 02:39:25,0
waves of

445
02:39:25,0 --> 02:39:25,0
the

446
02:39:25,0 --> 02:39:25,0
sea,

447
02:39:25,0 --> 02:39:25,0
and the

448
02:39:25,0 --> 02:39:25,0
winds

449
02:39:25,0 --> 02:39:25,0
which

450
