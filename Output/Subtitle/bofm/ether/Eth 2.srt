00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:06,5
Chapter 2 The Jaredites prepare for their journey

2
00:00:06,5 --> 00:00:13,0
 to a promised land—It is a choice land whereon men

3
00:00:13,0 --> 00:00:19,5
 must serve Christ or be swept off—The Lord talks

4
00:00:19,5 --> 00:00:26,0
 to the brother of Jared for three hours—The

5
00:00:26,0 --> 00:00:32,5
 Jaredites build barges—The Lord asks the brother of

6
00:00:32,5 --> 00:00:39,0
 Jared to propose how the barges will be lighted.

7
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:52,444
1 And it came to pass that Jared and his brother,

8
00:00:52,444 --> 00:01:05,015
 and their families, and also the friends of Jared

9
00:01:05,015 --> 00:01:17,586
 and his brother and their families, went down into

10
00:01:17,586 --> 00:01:30,157
 the valley which was northward, (and the name of

11
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:42,728
 the valley was Nimrod, being called after the

12
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:55,299
 mighty hunter) with their flocks which they had

13
00:01:55,299 --> 00:02:07,87
 gathered together, male and female, of every kind

14
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:15,594
2 And they did also lay snares and catch fowls of

15
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:23,594
 the air; and they did also prepare a vessel, in

16
00:02:23,594 --> 00:02:31,594
 which they did carry with them the fish of the

17
00:02:31,594 --> 00:02:39,594
 waters

18
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:45,893
3 And they did also carry with them deseret,

19
00:02:45,893 --> 00:02:52,293
 which, by interpretation, is a honey bee; and thus they

20
00:02:52,293 --> 00:02:58,693
 did carry with them swarms of bees, and all

21
00:02:58,693 --> 00:03:05,093
 manner of that which was upon the face of the land,

22
00:03:05,093 --> 00:03:11,493
 seeds of every kind

23
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,391
4 And it came to pass that when they had come down

24
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:15,391
 into the valley of Nimrod the Lord came down and

25
00:03:15,391 --> 00:03:17,391
 talked with the brother of Jared; and he was in a

26
00:03:17,391 --> 00:03:19,391
 cloud, and the brother of Jared saw him not

27
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:30,795
5 And it came to pass that the Lord commanded them

28
00:03:30,795 --> 00:03:42,224
 that they should go forth into the wilderness,

29
00:03:42,224 --> 00:03:53,653
 yea, into that quarter where there never had man

30
00:03:53,653 --> 00:04:05,082
 been. And it came to pass that the Lord did go before

31
00:04:05,082 --> 00:04:16,511
 them, and did talk with them as he stood in a

32
00:04:16,511 --> 00:04:27,94
 cloud, and gave directions whither they should

33
00:04:27,94 --> 00:04:39,369
 travel

34
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:50,862
6 And it came to pass that they did travel in the

35
00:04:50,862 --> 00:05:02,612
 wilderness, and did build barges, in which they

36
00:05:02,612 --> 00:05:14,362
 did cross many waters, being directed continually by

37
00:05:14,362 --> 00:05:26,112
 the hand of the Lord

38
00:05:26,96 --> 00:05:28,293
7 And the Lord would not suffer that they should

39
00:05:28,293 --> 00:05:29,626
 stop beyond the sea in the wilderness, but he would

40
00:05:29,626 --> 00:05:30,959
 that they should come forth even unto the land of

41
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,292
 promise, which was choice above all other lands,

42
00:05:32,292 --> 00:05:33,625
 which the Lord God had preserved for a righteous

43
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,958
 people

44
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:36,268
8 And he had sworn in his wrath unto the brother

45
00:05:36,268 --> 00:05:37,601
 of Jared, that whoso should possess this land of

46
00:05:37,601 --> 00:05:38,934
 promise, from that time henceforth and forever,

47
00:05:38,934 --> 00:05:40,267
 should serve him, the true and only God, or they

48
00:05:40,267 --> 00:05:41,6
 should be swept off when the fulness of his wrath

49
00:05:41,6 --> 00:05:42,933
 should come upon them

50
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:43,052
9 And now, we can behold the decrees of God

51
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:43,195
 concerning this land, that it is a land of promise; and

52
00:05:43,195 --> 00:05:43,338
 whatsoever nation shall possess it shall serve

53
00:05:43,338 --> 00:05:43,481
 God, or they shall be swept off when the fulness of

54
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:43,624
 his wrath shall come upon them. And the fulness of

55
00:05:43,624 --> 00:05:43,767
 his wrath cometh upon them when they are ripened

56
00:05:43,767 --> 00:05:43,91
 in iniquity

57
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:47,176
10 For behold, this is a land which is choice

58
00:05:47,176 --> 00:05:51,009
 above all other lands; wherefore he that doth possess

59
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:54,842
 it shall serve God or shall be swept off; for it

60
00:05:54,842 --> 00:05:58,675
 is the everlasting decree of God. And it is not

61
00:05:58,675 --> 00:06:02,508
 until the fulness of iniquity among the children of

62
00:06:02,508 --> 00:06:06,341
 the land, that they are swept off

63
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:14,566
11 And this cometh unto you, O ye Gentiles, that

64
00:06:14,566 --> 00:06:23,066
 ye may know the decrees of God—that ye may repent,

65
00:06:23,066 --> 00:06:31,566
 and not continue in your iniquities until the

66
00:06:31,566 --> 00:06:40,066
 fulness come, that ye may not bring down the fulness

67
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:48,566
 of the wrath of God upon you as the inhabitants of

68
00:06:48,566 --> 00:06:57,066
 the land have hitherto done

69
00:06:57,25 --> 00:07:02,25
12 Behold, this is a choice land, and whatsoever

70
00:07:02,25 --> 00:07:07,25
 nation shall possess it shall be free from bondage,

71
00:07:07,25 --> 00:07:12,25
 and from captivity, and from all other nations

72
00:07:12,25 --> 00:07:17,25
 under heaven, if they will but serve the God of the

73
00:07:17,25 --> 00:07:22,25
 land, who is Jesus Christ, who hath been

74
00:07:22,25 --> 00:07:27,25
 manifested by the things which we have written

75
00:07:27,18 --> 00:07:33,18
13 And now I proceed with my record; for behold,

76
00:07:33,18 --> 00:07:39,18
 it came to pass that the Lord did bring Jared and

77
00:07:39,18 --> 00:07:45,18
 his brethren forth even to that great sea which

78
00:07:45,18 --> 00:07:51,18
 divideth the lands. And as they came to the sea they

79
00:07:51,18 --> 00:07:57,18
 pitched their tents; and they called the name of

80
00:07:57,18 --> 00:08:03,18
 the place Moriancumer; and they dwelt in tents, and

81
00:08:03,18 --> 00:08:09,18
 dwelt in tents upon the seashore for the space of

82
00:08:09,18 --> 00:08:15,18
 four years

83
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:20,395
14 And it came to pass at the end of four years

84
00:08:20,395 --> 00:08:25,395
 that the Lord came again unto the brother of Jared,

85
00:08:25,395 --> 00:08:30,395
 and stood in a cloud and talked with him. And for

86
00:08:30,395 --> 00:08:35,395
 the space of three hours did the Lord talk with

87
00:08:35,395 --> 00:08:40,395
 the brother of Jared, and chastened him because he

88
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:45,395
 remembered not to call upon the name of the Lord

89
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:51,008
15 And the brother of Jared repented of the evil

90
00:08:51,008 --> 00:08:56,925
 which he had done, and did call upon the name of

91
00:08:56,925 --> 00:09:02,842
 the Lord for his brethren who were with him. And the

92
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:08,759
 Lord said unto him: I will forgive thee and thy

93
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:14,676
 brethren of their sins; but thou shalt not sin any

94
00:09:14,676 --> 00:09:20,593
 more, for ye shall remember that my Spirit will

95
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:26,51
 not always strive with man; wherefore, if ye will

96
00:09:26,51 --> 00:09:32,427
 sin until ye are fully ripe ye shall be cut off from

97
00:09:32,427 --> 00:09:38,344
 the presence of the Lord. And these are my

98
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:44,261
 thoughts upon the land which I shall give you for your

99
00:09:44,261 --> 00:09:50,178
 inheritance; for it shall be a land choice above

100
00:09:50,178 --> 00:09:56,095
 all other lands

101
00:09:56,396 --> 00:10:02,021
16 And the Lord said: Go to work and build, after

102
00:10:02,021 --> 00:10:07,646
 the manner of barges which ye have hitherto built.

103
00:10:07,646 --> 00:10:13,271
 And it came to pass that the brother of Jared did

104
00:10:13,271 --> 00:10:18,896
 go to work, and also his brethren, and built

105
00:10:18,896 --> 00:10:24,521
 barges after the manner which they had built,

106
00:10:24,521 --> 00:10:30,146
 according to the instructions of the Lord. And they were

107
00:10:30,146 --> 00:10:35,771
 small, and they were light upon the water, even

108
00:10:35,771 --> 00:10:41,396
 like unto the lightness of a fowl upon the water

109
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:48,875
17 And they were built after a manner that they

110
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:55,875
 were exceedingly tight, even that they would hold

111
00:10:55,875 --> 00:11:02,875
 water like unto a dish; and the bottom thereof was

112
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:09,875
 tight like unto a dish; and the sides thereof were

113
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:16,875
 tight like unto a dish; and the ends thereof were

114
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:23,875
 peaked; and the top thereof was tight like unto a

115
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:30,875
 dish; and the length thereof was the length of a

116
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:37,875
 tree; and the door thereof, when it was shut, was

117
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:44,875
 tight like unto a dish

118
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:49,971
18 And it came to pass that the brother of Jared

119
00:11:49,971 --> 00:11:54,971
 cried unto the Lord, saying: O Lord, I have

120
00:11:54,971 --> 00:11:59,971
 performed the work which thou hast commanded me, and I

121
00:11:59,971 --> 00:12:04,971
 have made the barges according as thou hast directed

122
00:12:04,971 --> 00:12:09,971
 me

123
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:27,696
19 And behold, O Lord, in them there is no light;

124
00:12:27,696 --> 00:12:45,696
 whither shall we steer? And also we shall perish,

125
00:12:45,696 --> 00:13:03,696
 for in them we cannot breathe, save it is the air

126
00:13:03,696 --> 00:13:21,696
 which is in them; therefore we shall perish

127
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:29,467
20 And the Lord said unto the brother of Jared:

128
00:13:29,467 --> 00:13:37,467
 Behold, thou shalt make a hole in the top, and also

129
00:13:37,467 --> 00:13:45,467
 in the bottom; and when thou shalt suffer for air

130
00:13:45,467 --> 00:13:53,467
 thou shalt unstop the hole and receive air. And if

131
00:13:53,467 --> 00:14:01,467
 it be so that the water come in upon thee,

132
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:09,467
 behold, ye shall stop the hole, that ye may not perish

133
00:14:09,467 --> 00:14:17,467
 in the flood

134
00:14:17,29 --> 00:14:21,29
21 And it came to pass that the brother of Jared

135
00:14:21,29 --> 00:14:25,29
 did so, according as the Lord had commanded

136
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:26,264
22 And he cried again unto the Lord saying: O

137
00:14:26,264 --> 00:14:27,264
 Lord, behold I have done even as thou hast commanded

138
00:14:27,264 --> 00:14:28,264
 me; and I have prepared the vessels for my people,

139
00:14:28,264 --> 00:14:29,264
 and behold there is no light in them. Behold, O

140
00:14:29,264 --> 00:14:30,264
 Lord, wilt thou suffer that we shall cross this

141
00:14:30,264 --> 00:14:31,264
 great water in darkness

142
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:31,87
23 And the Lord said unto the brother of Jared:

143
00:14:31,87 --> 00:14:32,703
 What will ye that I should do that ye may have light

144
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,536
 in your vessels? For behold, ye cannot have

145
00:14:33,536 --> 00:14:34,369
 windows, for they will be dashed in pieces; neither

146
00:14:34,369 --> 00:14:35,202
 shall ye take fire with you, for ye shall not go by

147
00:14:35,202 --> 00:14:36,035
 the light of fire

148
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:44,309
24 For behold, ye shall be as a whale in the midst

149
00:14:44,309 --> 00:14:51,809
 of the sea; for the mountain waves shall dash

150
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:59,309
 upon you. Nevertheless, I will bring you up again out

151
00:14:59,309 --> 00:15:06,809
 of the depths of the sea; for the winds have gone

152
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:14,309
 forth out of my mouth, and also the rains and the

153
00:15:14,309 --> 00:15:21,809
 floods have I sent forth

154
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:22,097
25 And behold, I prepare you against these things;

155
00:15:22,097 --> 00:15:22,24
 for ye cannot cross this great deep save I

156
00:15:22,24 --> 00:15:22,383
 prepare you against the waves of the sea, and the winds

157
00:15:22,383 --> 00:15:22,526
 which have gone forth, and the floods which shall

158
00:15:22,526 --> 00:15:22,669
 come. Therefore what will ye that I should prepare

159
00:15:22,669 --> 00:15:22,812
 for you that ye may have light when ye are

160
00:15:22,812 --> 00:15:22,955
 swallowed up in the depths of the sea?
