00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:02,167
Chapter 2 The Jaredites prepare for their journey

2
00:00:02,167 --> 00:00:04,334
to a promised land—It is a choice land whereon

3
00:00:04,334 --> 00:00:06,501
men must serve Christ or be swept off—The Lord

4
00:00:06,501 --> 00:00:08,668
talks to the brother of Jared for three hours—The

5
00:00:08,668 --> 00:00:10,835
Jaredites build barges—The Lord asks the brother of

6
00:00:10,835 --> 00:00:13,38
Jared to propose how the barges will be lighted. 

7
00:00:13,38 --> 00:00:16,88
1 And it came to pass that Jared and his

8
00:00:16,88 --> 00:00:20,38
brother, and their families, and also the

9
00:00:20,38 --> 00:00:23,88
friends of Jared and his brother and their

10
00:00:23,88 --> 00:00:27,38
families, went down into the valley which was

11
00:00:27,38 --> 00:00:30,88
northward, (and the name of the valley was

12
00:00:30,88 --> 00:00:34,38
Nimrod, being called after the mighty

13
00:00:34,38 --> 00:00:37,88
hunter) with their flocks which they had

14
00:00:37,88 --> 00:00:41,708
gathered together, male and female, of every kind.

15
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
2 And they did also lay snares and

16
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
catch fowls of the air; and they did also

17
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
prepare a vessel, in which they did

18
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
carry with them the fish of the waters.

19
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
3 And they did also carry with them

20
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
deseret, which, by interpretation,

21
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
is a honey bee; and thus they did

22
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
carry with them swarms of bees, and all

23
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
manner of that which was upon the

24
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
face of the land, seeds of every kind.

25
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
4 And it came to pass that when

26
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
they had come down into the

27
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
valley of Nimrod the Lord came down

28
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
and talked with the brother of

29
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
Jared; and he was in a cloud, and

30
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
the brother of Jared saw him not.

31
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
5 And it came to pass that the

32
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
Lord commanded them that they

33
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
should go forth into the

34
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
wilderness, yea, into that quarter

35
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
where there never had man

36
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
been. And it came to pass that

37
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
the Lord did go before them, and

38
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
did talk with them as he

39
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
stood in a cloud, and gave

40
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
directions whither they should travel.

41
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
6 And it came to pass that

42
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
they did travel in the

43
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
wilderness, and did build barges,

44
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
in which they did cross many

45
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
waters, being directed

46
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
continually by the hand of the Lord.

47
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
7 And the Lord would not

48
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
suffer that they should

49
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
stop beyond the sea in the

50
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
wilderness, but he would

51
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
that they should come

52
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
forth even unto the land of

53
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
promise, which was

54
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
choice above all other lands,

55
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
which the Lord God had

56
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
preserved for a righteous people.

57
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
8 And he had sworn in

58
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
his wrath unto the brother

59
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
of Jared, that whoso

60
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
should possess this land

61
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
of promise, from that

62
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
time henceforth and

63
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
forever, should serve him, the

64
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
true and only God, or

65
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
they should be swept off

66
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
when the fulness of his

67
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
wrath should come upon them.

68
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
9 And now, we can

69
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
behold the decrees of God

70
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
concerning this land,

71
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
that it is a land of

72
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
promise; and whatsoever

73
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
nation shall possess it

74
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
shall serve God, or they

75
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
shall be swept off when

76
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
the fulness of his

77
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
wrath shall come upon them.

78
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
And the fulness of his

79
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
wrath cometh upon them

80
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
when they are ripened in iniquity.

81
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
10 For behold, this

82
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
is a land which is

83
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
choice above all other

84
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
lands; wherefore he

85
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
that doth possess it

86
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
shall serve God or

87
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
shall be swept off; for

88
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
it is the everlasting

89
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
decree of God. And it

90
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
is not until the

91
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
fulness of iniquity

92
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
among the children of the

93
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
land, that they are swept off.

94
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
11 And this cometh

95
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
unto you, O ye

96
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
Gentiles, that ye may

97
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
know the decrees of

98
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
God—that ye may

99
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
repent, and not

100
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
continue in your

101
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
iniquities until the

102
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
fulness come, that ye may

103
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
not bring down the

104
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
fulness of the

105
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
wrath of God upon you

106
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
as the inhabitants

107
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
of the land have hitherto done.

108
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
12 Behold, this is

109
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
a choice land,

110
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
and whatsoever

111
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
nation shall possess it

112
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
shall be free

113
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
from bondage, and

114
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
from captivity, and

115
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
from all other

116
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
nations under heaven,

117
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
if they will but

118
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
serve the God of

119
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
the land, who is

120
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
Jesus Christ, who

121
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
hath been manifested

122
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
by the things

123
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
which we have written.

124
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
13 And now I

125
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
proceed with my

126
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
record; for behold, it

127
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
came to pass

128
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
that the Lord did

129
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
bring Jared and his

130
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
brethren forth

131
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
even to that great

132
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
sea which

133
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
divideth the lands. And

134
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
as they came to

135
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
the sea they

136
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
pitched their tents;

137
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
and they called

138
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
the name of the

139
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
place Moriancumer;

140
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
and they dwelt in

141
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
tents, and dwelt

142
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
in tents upon

143
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
the seashore for

144
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
the space of four years.

145
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
14 And it came

146
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
to pass at the

147
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
end of four years

148
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
that the Lord

149
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
came again unto

150
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
the brother of

151
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
Jared, and stood in

152
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
a cloud and

153
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
talked with him.

154
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
And for the space

155
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
of three hours

156
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
did the Lord talk

157
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
with the

158
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
brother of Jared, and

159
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
chastened him

160
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
because he

161
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
remembered not to call

162
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
upon the name of the Lord.

163
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
15 And the

164
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
brother of Jared

165
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
repented of the

166
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
evil which he

167
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
had done, and did

168
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
call upon the

169
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
name of the

170
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
Lord for his

171
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
brethren who were

172
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
with him. And the

173
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
Lord said unto

174
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
him: I will

175
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
forgive thee and

176
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
thy brethren of

177
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
their sins;

178
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
but thou shalt

179
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
not sin any more,

180
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
for ye shall

181
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
remember that my

182
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
Spirit will

183
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
not always strive

184
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
with man;

185
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
wherefore, if ye

186
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
will sin until ye

187
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
are fully ripe

188
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
ye shall be

189
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
cut off from the

190
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
presence of the

191
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
Lord. And

192
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
these are my

193
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
thoughts upon the

194
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
land which I shall

195
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
give you for

196
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
your

197
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
inheritance; for it shall

198
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
be a land choice above all other lands.

199
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
16 And the

200
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
Lord said: Go to

201
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
work and

202
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
build, after the

203
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
manner of barges

204
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
which ye have

205
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
hitherto

206
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
built. And it came

207
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
to pass that

208
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
the brother of

209
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
Jared did go

210
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
to work, and

211
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
also his

212
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
brethren, and built

213
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
barges after

214
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
the manner

215
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
which they had

216
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
built, according

217
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
to the

218
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
instructions of the

219
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
Lord. And they

220
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
were small,

221
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
and they were

222
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
light upon the

223
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
water, even

224
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
like unto the

225
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
lightness of a fowl upon the water.

226
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
17 And they

227
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
were built

228
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
after a manner

229
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
that they were

230
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
exceedingly

231
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
tight, even

232
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
that they

233
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
would hold water

234
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
like unto a

235
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
dish; and the

236
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
bottom

237
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
thereof was tight

238
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
like unto a

239
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
dish; and the

240
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
sides thereof

241
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
were tight

242
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
like unto a

243
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
dish; and the

244
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
ends thereof

245
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
were peaked;

246
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
and the top

247
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
thereof was

248
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
tight like unto a

249
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
dish; and

250
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
the length

251
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
thereof was the

252
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
length of a

253
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
tree; and the

254
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
door thereof,

255
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
when it was

256
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
shut, was tight like unto a dish.

257
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
18 And it

258
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
came to pass

259
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
that the

260
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
brother of Jared

261
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
cried unto

262
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
the Lord,

263
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
saying: O

264
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
Lord, I have

265
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
performed the

266
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
work which

267
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
thou hast

268
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
commanded me,

269
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
and I have

270
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
made the barges

271
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
according

272
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
as thou hast directed me.

273
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
19 And

274
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
behold, O Lord,

275
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
in them

276
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
there is no

277
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
light;

278
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
whither shall we

279
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
steer? And

280
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
also we

281
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
shall perish,

282
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
for in

283
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
them we cannot

284
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
breathe,

285
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
save it is

286
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
the air

287
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
which is in

288
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
them;

289
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
therefore we shall perish.

290
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
20 And the

291
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
Lord said

292
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
unto the

293
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
brother of

294
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
Jared:

295
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
Behold, thou

296
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
shalt

297
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
make a hole

298
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
in the top,

299
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
and also

300
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
in the

301
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
bottom; and

302
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
when thou

303
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
shalt

304
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
suffer for air

305
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
thou shalt

306
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
unstop

307
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
the hole and

308
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
receive

309
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
air. And if

310
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
it be so

311
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
that the

312
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
water come

313
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
in upon

314
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
thee,

315
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
behold, ye shall

316
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
stop the

317
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
hole, that

318
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
ye may not perish in the flood.

319
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
21 And it

320
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
came to

321
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
pass that

322
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
the

323
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
brother of

324
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
Jared did

325
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
so,

326
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
according as

327
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
the Lord

328
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
had commanded.

329
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
22 And he

330
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
cried

331
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
again unto

332
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
the Lord

333
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
saying: O

334
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
Lord,

335
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
behold I

336
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
have done

337
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
even as

338
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
thou hast

339
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
commanded

340
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
me; and I

341
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
have

342
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
prepared the

343
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
vessels

344
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
for my

345
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
people, and

346
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
behold

347
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
there is

348
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
no light

349
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
in them.

350
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
Behold, O

351
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
Lord,

352
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
wilt thou

353
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
suffer that

354
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
we shall

355
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
cross

356
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
this great

357
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
water in

358
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
darkness?

359
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
23 And

360
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
the Lord

361
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
said

362
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
unto the

363
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
brother of

364
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
Jared:

365
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
What

366
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
will ye

367
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
that I

368
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
should do

369
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
that ye

370
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
may have

371
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
light in

372
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
your

373
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
vessels?

374
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
For

375
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
behold, ye

376
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
cannot have

377
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708


378
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
windows, for

379
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
they will

380
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
be

381
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
dashed in

382
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
pieces;

383
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
neither

384
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
shall ye

385
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
take fire

386
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
with

387
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
you, for ye

388
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
shall not go by the light of fire.

389
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
24 For

390
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
behold,

391
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
ye

392
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
shall be

393
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
as a

394
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
whale in

395
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
the

396
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
midst of

397
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
the sea;

398
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
for the

399
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708


400
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
mountain

401
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
waves shall

402
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708

404
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
you.

405
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708


406
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
Nevertheless, I

407
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
will bring

408
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
you up

409
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
again

410
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
out of

411
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
the

412
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
depths of

413
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
the

414
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
sea; for

415
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
the

416
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
winds have

417
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
gone

418
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
forth out

419
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
of my

420
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
mouth,

421
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
and

422
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
also the

423
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
rains and the floods have I sent forth.

424
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
25 And

425
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708


426
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
behold, I

429
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
against

430
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
these

431
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708


432
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
things; for

433
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
ye

434
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
cannot

435
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
cross

436
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
this

437
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
great

438
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
deep

439
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
save I

440
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708

441
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
you

442
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
against

443
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
the

444
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
waves of

445
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
the

446
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
sea,

447
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
and the

448
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
winds

449
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
which

450
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
have

451
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
gone

452
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
forth,

453
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
and the

454
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708


455
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
floods

456
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
which

457
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
shall

458
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
come.

459
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
Therefore

460
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
what

461
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708

462
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708

463
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
I

464
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708

465
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
prepare

466
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
for you

467
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
that

468
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
ye may

469
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
have

470
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
light

471
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,708
when ye are swallowed up in the depths of the sea?
