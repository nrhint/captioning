00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,75
Chapter 10 One king succeeds another—Some of the

2
00:00:01,75 --> 00:00:03,5
 kings are righteous; others are wicked—When

3
00:00:03,5 --> 00:00:05,25
 righteousness prevails, the people are blessed and

4
00:00:05,25 --> 00:00:07,0
 prospered by the Lord.

5
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,975
1 And it came to pass that Shez, who was a

6
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:11,975
 descendant of Heth—for Heth had perished by the famine,

7
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:13,975
 and all his household save it were Shez—wherefore,

8
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:15,975
 Shez began to build up again a broken people

9
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,282
2 And it came to pass that Shez did remember the

10
00:00:17,282 --> 00:00:18,615
 destruction of his fathers, and he did build up a

11
00:00:18,615 --> 00:00:19,948
 righteous kingdom; for he remembered what the Lord

12
00:00:19,948 --> 00:00:21,281
 had done in bringing Jared and his brother across

13
00:00:21,281 --> 00:00:22,614
 the deep; and he did walk in the ways of the Lord;

14
00:00:22,614 --> 00:00:23,947
 and he begat sons and daughters

15
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,924
3 And his eldest son, whose name was Shez, did

16
00:00:25,924 --> 00:00:27,924
 rebel against him; nevertheless, Shez was smitten by

17
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:29,924
 the hand of a robber, because of his exceeding

18
00:00:29,924 --> 00:00:31,924
 riches, which brought peace again unto his father

19
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,232
4 And it came to pass that his father did build up

20
00:00:33,232 --> 00:00:34,565
 many cities upon the face of the land, and the

21
00:00:34,565 --> 00:00:35,898
 people began again to spread over all the face of

22
00:00:35,898 --> 00:00:37,231
 the land. And Shez did live to an exceedingly old

23
00:00:37,231 --> 00:00:38,564
 age; and he begat Riplakish. And he died, and

24
00:00:38,564 --> 00:00:39,897
 Riplakish reigned in his stead

25
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,016
5 And it came to pass that Riplakish did not do

26
00:00:41,016 --> 00:00:42,159
 that which was right in the sight of the Lord, for

27
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:43,302
 he did have many wives and concubines, and did lay

28
00:00:43,302 --> 00:00:44,445
 that upon men’s shoulders which was grievous to be

29
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:45,588
 borne; yea, he did tax them with heavy taxes; and

30
00:00:45,588 --> 00:00:46,731
 with the taxes he did build many spacious

31
00:00:46,731 --> 00:00:47,874
 buildings

32
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:48,991
6 And he did erect him an exceedingly beautiful

33
00:00:48,991 --> 00:00:50,134
 throne; and he did build many prisons, and whoso

34
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:51,277
 would not be subject unto taxes he did cast into

35
00:00:51,277 --> 00:00:52,42
 prison; and whoso was not able to pay taxes he did

36
00:00:52,42 --> 00:00:53,563
 cast into prison; and he did cause that they should

37
00:00:53,563 --> 00:00:54,706
 labor continually for their support; and whoso

38
00:00:54,706 --> 00:00:55,849
 refused to labor he did cause to be put to death

39
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,155
7 Wherefore he did obtain all his fine work, yea,

40
00:00:57,155 --> 00:00:58,488
 even his fine gold he did cause to be refined in

41
00:00:58,488 --> 00:00:59,821
 prison; and all manner of fine workmanship he did

42
00:00:59,821 --> 00:01:01,154
 cause to be wrought in prison. And it came to pass

43
00:01:01,154 --> 00:01:02,487
 that he did afflict the people with his whoredoms

44
00:01:02,487 --> 00:01:03,82
 and abominations

45
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,397
8 And when he had reigned for the space of forty

46
00:01:05,397 --> 00:01:06,997
 and two years the people did rise up in rebellion

47
00:01:06,997 --> 00:01:08,597
 against him; and there began to be war again in the

48
00:01:08,597 --> 00:01:10,197
 land, insomuch that Riplakish was killed, and his

49
00:01:10,197 --> 00:01:11,797
 descendants were driven out of the land

50
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:13,772
9 And it came to pass after the space of many

51
00:01:13,772 --> 00:01:15,772
 years, Morianton, (he being a descendant of Riplakish)

52
00:01:15,772 --> 00:01:17,772
 gathered together an army of outcasts, and went

53
00:01:17,772 --> 00:01:19,772
 forth and gave battle unto the people; and he

54
00:01:19,772 --> 00:01:21,772
 gained power over many cities; and the war became

55
00:01:21,772 --> 00:01:23,772
 exceedingly sore, and did last for the space of many

56
00:01:23,772 --> 00:01:25,772
 years; and he did gain power over all the land, and

57
00:01:25,772 --> 00:01:27,772
 did establish himself king over all the land

58
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:29,721
10 And after that he had established himself king

59
00:01:29,721 --> 00:01:31,721
 he did ease the burden of the people, by which he

60
00:01:31,721 --> 00:01:33,721
 did gain favor in the eyes of the people, and they

61
00:01:33,721 --> 00:01:35,721
 did anoint him to be their king

62
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:38,363
11 And he did do justice unto the people, but not

63
00:01:38,363 --> 00:01:41,03
 unto himself because of his many whoredoms;

64
00:01:41,03 --> 00:01:43,697
 wherefore he was cut off from the presence of the Lord

65
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:45,003
12 And it came to pass that Morianton built up

66
00:01:45,003 --> 00:01:46,336
 many cities, and the people became exceedingly rich

67
00:01:46,336 --> 00:01:47,669
 under his reign, both in buildings, and in gold and

68
00:01:47,669 --> 00:01:49,002
 silver, and in raising grain, and in flocks, and

69
00:01:49,002 --> 00:01:50,335
 herds, and such things which had been restored

70
00:01:50,335 --> 00:01:51,668
 unto them

71
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:52,978
13 And Morianton did live to an exceedingly great

72
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:54,311
 age, and then he begat Kim; and Kim did reign in

73
00:01:54,311 --> 00:01:55,644
 the stead of his father; and he did reign eight

74
00:01:55,644 --> 00:01:56,977
 years, and his father died. And it came to pass that

75
00:01:56,977 --> 00:01:58,31
 Kim did not reign in righteousness, wherefore he

76
00:01:58,31 --> 00:01:59,643
 was not favored of the Lord

77
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:01,219
14 And his brother did rise up in rebellion

78
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:02,82
 against him, by which he did bring him into captivity;

79
00:02:02,82 --> 00:02:04,419
 and he did remain in captivity all his days; and he

80
00:02:04,419 --> 00:02:06,02
 begat sons and daughters in captivity, and in his

81
00:02:06,02 --> 00:02:07,62
 old age he begat Levi; and he died

82
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,194
15 And it came to pass that Levi did serve in

83
00:02:09,194 --> 00:02:10,794
 captivity after the death of his father, for the space

84
00:02:10,794 --> 00:02:12,394
 of forty and two years. And he did make war

85
00:02:12,394 --> 00:02:13,994
 against the king of the land, by which he did obtain

86
00:02:13,994 --> 00:02:15,594
 unto himself the kingdom

87
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:16,902
16 And after he had obtained unto himself the

88
00:02:16,902 --> 00:02:18,235
 kingdom he did that which was right in the sight of

89
00:02:18,235 --> 00:02:19,568
 the Lord; and the people did prosper in the land;

90
00:02:19,568 --> 00:02:20,901
 and he did live to a good old age, and begat sons

91
00:02:20,901 --> 00:02:22,234
 and daughters; and he also begat Corom, whom he

92
00:02:22,234 --> 00:02:23,567
 anointed king in his stead

93
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:24,876
17 And it came to pass that Corom did that which

94
00:02:24,876 --> 00:02:26,209
 was good in the sight of the Lord all his days; and

95
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:27,542
 he begat many sons and daughters; and after he

96
00:02:27,542 --> 00:02:28,875
 had seen many days he did pass away, even like unto

97
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:30,208
 the rest of the earth; and Kish reigned in his

98
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:31,541
 stead

99
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:35,518
18 And it came to pass that Kish passed away also,

100
00:02:35,518 --> 00:02:39,518
 and Lib reigned in his stead

101
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:40,636
19 And it came to pass that Lib also did that

102
00:02:40,636 --> 00:02:41,779
 which was good in the sight of the Lord. And in the

103
00:02:41,779 --> 00:02:42,922
 days of Lib the poisonous serpents were destroyed.

104
00:02:42,922 --> 00:02:44,065
 Wherefore they did go into the land southward, to

105
00:02:44,065 --> 00:02:45,208
 hunt food for the people of the land, for the land

106
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,351
 was covered with animals of the forest. And Lib

107
00:02:46,351 --> 00:02:47,494
 also himself became a great hunter

108
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:50,134
20 And they built a great city by the narrow neck

109
00:02:50,134 --> 00:02:52,801
 of land, by the place where the sea divides the

110
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:55,468
 land

111
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:58,109
21 And they did preserve the land southward for a

112
00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:00,776
 wilderness, to get game. And the whole face of the

113
00:03:00,776 --> 00:03:03,443
 land northward was covered with inhabitants

114
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:06,084
22 And they were exceedingly industrious, and they

115
00:03:06,084 --> 00:03:08,751
 did buy and sell and traffic one with another,

116
00:03:08,751 --> 00:03:11,418
 that they might get gain

117
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:12,534
23 And they did work in all manner of ore, and

118
00:03:12,534 --> 00:03:13,677
 they did make gold, and silver, and iron, and brass,

119
00:03:13,677 --> 00:03:14,82
 and all manner of metals; and they did dig it out

120
00:03:14,82 --> 00:03:15,963
 of the earth; wherefore, they did cast up mighty

121
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:17,106
 heaps of earth to get ore, of gold, and of silver,

122
00:03:17,106 --> 00:03:18,249
 and of iron, and of copper. And they did work all

123
00:03:18,249 --> 00:03:19,392
 manner of fine work

124
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:22,033
24 And they did have silks, and fine-twined linen;

125
00:03:22,033 --> 00:03:24,7
 and they did work all manner of cloth, that they

126
00:03:24,7 --> 00:03:27,367
 might clothe themselves from their nakedness

127
00:03:27,34 --> 00:03:30,007
25 And they did make all manner of tools to till

128
00:03:30,007 --> 00:03:32,674
 the earth, both to plow and to sow, to reap and to

129
00:03:32,674 --> 00:03:35,341
 hoe, and also to thrash

130
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:39,315
26 And they did make all manner of tools with

131
00:03:39,315 --> 00:03:43,315
 which they did work their beasts

132
00:03:43,29 --> 00:03:45,957
27 And they did make all manner of weapons of war.

133
00:03:45,957 --> 00:03:48,624
 And they did work all manner of work of

134
00:03:48,624 --> 00:03:51,291
 exceedingly curious workmanship

135
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,264
28 And never could be a people more blessed than

136
00:03:53,264 --> 00:03:55,264
 were they, and more prospered by the hand of the

137
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,264
 Lord. And they were in a land that was choice above

138
00:03:57,264 --> 00:03:59,264
 all lands, for the Lord had spoken it

139
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,906
29 And it came to pass that Lib did live many

140
00:04:01,906 --> 00:04:04,573
 years, and begat sons and daughters; and he also begat

141
00:04:04,573 --> 00:04:07,24
 Hearthom

142
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:08,547
30 And it came to pass that Hearthom reigned in

143
00:04:08,547 --> 00:04:09,88
 the stead of his father. And when Hearthom had

144
00:04:09,88 --> 00:04:11,213
 reigned twenty and four years, behold, the kingdom was

145
00:04:11,213 --> 00:04:12,546
 taken away from him. And he served many years in

146
00:04:12,546 --> 00:04:13,879
 captivity, yea, even all the remainder of his days

147
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,212


148
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,521
31 And he begat Heth, and Heth lived in captivity

149
00:04:16,521 --> 00:04:17,854
 all his days. And Heth begat Aaron, and Aaron

150
00:04:17,854 --> 00:04:19,187
 dwelt in captivity all his days; and he begat

151
00:04:19,187 --> 00:04:20,52
 Amnigaddah, and Amnigaddah also dwelt in captivity all his

152
00:04:20,52 --> 00:04:21,853
 days; and he begat Coriantum, and Coriantum dwelt

153
00:04:21,853 --> 00:04:23,186
 in captivity all his days; and he begat Com

154
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:24,306
32 And it came to pass that Com drew away the half

155
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:25,449
 of the kingdom. And he reigned over the half of

156
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:26,592
 the kingdom forty and two years; and he went to

157
00:04:26,592 --> 00:04:27,735
 battle against the king, Amgid, and they fought for

158
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:28,878
 the space of many years, during which time Com

159
00:04:28,878 --> 00:04:30,021
 gained power over Amgid, and obtained power over the

160
00:04:30,021 --> 00:04:31,164
 remainder of the kingdom

161
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:33,138
33 And in the days of Com there began to be

162
00:04:33,138 --> 00:04:35,138
 robbers in the land; and they adopted the old plans, and

163
00:04:35,138 --> 00:04:37,138
 administered oaths after the manner of the

164
00:04:37,138 --> 00:04:39,138
 ancients, and sought again to destroy the kingdom

165
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:39,612
34 Now Com did fight against them much;

166
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:40,112
 nevertheless, he did not prevail against them.
