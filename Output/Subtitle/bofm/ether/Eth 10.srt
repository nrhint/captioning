00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:06,5
Chapter 10 One king succeeds another—Some

2
00:00:06,5 --> 00:00:13,0
of the kings are righteous; others are

3
00:00:13,0 --> 00:00:19,5
wicked—When righteousness prevails, the

4
00:00:19,5 --> 00:00:26,326
people are blessed and prospered by the Lord. 

5
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:26,126
1 And it came to pass that Shez, who

6
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:25,926
was a descendant of Heth—for Heth had

7
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:25,726
perished by the famine, and all his

8
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:25,526
household save it were Shez—wherefore, Shez

9
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:25,392
began to build up again a broken people.

10
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:25,267
2 And it came to pass that Shez did

11
00:00:25,267 --> 00:00:25,142
remember the destruction of his

12
00:00:25,142 --> 00:00:25,017
fathers, and he did build up a

13
00:00:25,017 --> 00:00:24,892
righteous kingdom; for he remembered what

14
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:24,767
the Lord had done in bringing

15
00:00:24,767 --> 00:00:24,642
Jared and his brother across the deep;

16
00:00:24,642 --> 00:00:24,517
and he did walk in the ways of the

17
00:00:24,517 --> 00:00:24,458
Lord; and he begat sons and daughters.

18
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:24,791
3 And his eldest son, whose name

19
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:25,124
was Shez, did rebel against

20
00:00:25,124 --> 00:00:25,457
him; nevertheless, Shez was smitten

21
00:00:25,457 --> 00:00:25,79
by the hand of a robber,

22
00:00:25,79 --> 00:00:26,123
because of his exceeding riches, which

23
00:00:26,123 --> 00:00:26,86
brought peace again unto his father.

24
00:00:26,86 --> 00:00:26,749
4 And it came to pass that his

25
00:00:26,749 --> 00:00:26,638
father did build up many

26
00:00:26,638 --> 00:00:26,527
cities upon the face of the land,

27
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:26,416
and the people began again to

28
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:26,305
spread over all the face of

29
00:00:26,305 --> 00:00:26,194
the land. And Shez did live to

30
00:00:26,194 --> 00:00:26,083
an exceedingly old age; and he

31
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:25,972
begat Riplakish. And he died,

32
00:00:25,972 --> 00:00:25,926
and Riplakish reigned in his stead.

33
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:26,381
5 And it came to pass that

34
00:00:26,381 --> 00:00:26,836
Riplakish did not do that

35
00:00:26,836 --> 00:00:27,291
which was right in the sight

36
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:27,746
of the Lord, for he did

37
00:00:27,746 --> 00:00:28,201
have many wives and

38
00:00:28,201 --> 00:00:28,656
concubines, and did lay that upon

39
00:00:28,656 --> 00:00:29,111
men’s shoulders which was

40
00:00:29,111 --> 00:00:29,566
grievous to be borne; yea, he

41
00:00:29,566 --> 00:00:30,021
did tax them with heavy

42
00:00:30,021 --> 00:00:30,476
taxes; and with the taxes he

43
00:00:30,476 --> 00:00:30,33
did build many spacious buildings.

44
00:00:30,33 --> 00:00:32,484
6 And he did erect him an

45
00:00:32,484 --> 00:00:34,638
exceedingly beautiful

46
00:00:34,638 --> 00:00:36,792
throne; and he did build many

47
00:00:36,792 --> 00:00:38,946
prisons, and whoso would

48
00:00:38,946 --> 00:00:41,1
not be subject unto taxes

49
00:00:41,1 --> 00:00:43,254
he did cast into prison;

50
00:00:43,254 --> 00:00:45,408
and whoso was not able to

51
00:00:45,408 --> 00:00:47,562
pay taxes he did cast into

52
00:00:47,562 --> 00:00:49,716
prison; and he did cause

53
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,87
that they should labor

54
00:00:51,87 --> 00:00:54,024
continually for their support;

55
00:00:54,024 --> 00:00:56,178
and whoso refused to labor

56
00:00:56,178 --> 00:00:58,659
he did cause to be put to death.

57
00:00:58,659 --> 00:00:58,568
7 Wherefore he did

58
00:00:58,568 --> 00:00:58,477
obtain all his fine work,

59
00:00:58,477 --> 00:00:58,386
yea, even his fine gold he

60
00:00:58,386 --> 00:00:58,295
did cause to be refined

61
00:00:58,295 --> 00:00:58,204
in prison; and all

62
00:00:58,204 --> 00:00:58,113
manner of fine workmanship he

63
00:00:58,113 --> 00:00:58,022
did cause to be wrought

64
00:00:58,022 --> 00:00:57,931
in prison. And it came

65
00:00:57,931 --> 00:00:57,84
to pass that he did

66
00:00:57,84 --> 00:00:57,749
afflict the people with his

67
00:00:57,749 --> 00:00:57,724
whoredoms and abominations.

68
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
8 And when he had

69
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
reigned for the space of

70
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
forty and two years

71
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
the people did rise

72
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
up in rebellion

73
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
against him; and there

74
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
began to be war again in

75
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
the land, insomuch

76
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
that Riplakish was

77
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
killed, and his

78
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
descendants were driven out of the land.

79
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
9 And it came to

80
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
pass after the space of

81
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
many years,

82
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
Morianton, (he being a

83
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
descendant of Riplakish)

84
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
gathered together

85
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
an army of outcasts,

86
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
and went forth and

87
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
gave battle unto the

88
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
people; and he

89
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
gained power over many

90
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
cities; and the war

91
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
became exceedingly

92
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
sore, and did last for

93
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
the space of many

94
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
years; and he did gain

95
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
power over all the

96
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
land, and did

97
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
establish himself king over all the land.

98
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
10 And after that

99
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
he had established

100
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
himself king he

101
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
did ease the burden

102
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
of the people, by

103
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
which he did gain

104
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
favor in the eyes

105
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
of the people,

106
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
and they did anoint

107
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
him to be their king.

108
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
11 And he did do

109
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
justice unto

110
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
the people, but

111
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
not unto himself

112
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
because of his

113
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
many whoredoms;

114
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
wherefore he was

115
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
cut off from the

116
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
presence of the Lord.

117
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
12 And it came

118
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
to pass that

119
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
Morianton built

120
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
up many cities,

121
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
and the people

122
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
became

123
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
exceedingly rich under

124
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
his reign, both

125
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
in buildings,

126
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
and in gold and

127
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
silver, and in

128
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
raising grain,

129
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
and in flocks,

130
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
and herds, and

131
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
such things

132
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
which had been

133
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
restored unto them.

134
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
13 And

135
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
Morianton did live to

136
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
an

137
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
exceedingly great age,

138
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
and then he

139
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
begat Kim; and

140
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
Kim did reign in

141
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
the stead of

142
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
his father;

143
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
and he did reign

144
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
eight years,

145
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
and his father

146
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
died. And it

147
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
came to pass

148
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
that Kim did

149
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
not reign in

150
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
righteousness,

151
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
wherefore he was

152
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
not favored of the Lord.

153
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
14 And his

154
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
brother did

155
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
rise up in

156
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
rebellion against

157
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
him, by which

158
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
he did bring

159
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
him into

160
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
captivity; and

161
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
he did remain

162
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
in captivity

163
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
all his days;

164
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
and he begat

165
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
sons and

166
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
daughters in

167
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
captivity, and

168
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
in his old age

169
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
he begat Levi; and he died.

170
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
15 And it

171
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
came to pass

172
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
that Levi did

173
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
serve in

174
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
captivity

175
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
after the death

176
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
of his

177
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
father, for the

178
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
space of

179
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
forty and two

180
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
years. And he

181
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
did make war

182
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
against the

183
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
king of the

184
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
land, by

185
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
which he did

186
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
obtain unto

187
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
himself the kingdom.

188
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
16 And

189
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
after he had

190
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
obtained unto

191
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
himself

192
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
the kingdom

193
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
he did that

194
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
which was

195
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
right in the

196
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
sight of

197
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
the Lord;

198
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
and the

224
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724

00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724

259
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
Wherefore

00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:57,724
they did go
