00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 10 One king succeeds another—Some

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of the kings are righteous; others are

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
wicked—When righteousness prevails, the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:11:43,
people are blessed and prospered by the Lord. 

5
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
1 And it came to pass that Shez, who

6
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
was a descendant of Heth—for Heth had

7
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
perished by the famine, and all his

8
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
household save it were Shez—wherefore, Shez

9
00:11:43,0 --> 00:13:55,
began to build up again a broken people.

10
00:13:55,0 --> 00:13:55,0
2 And it came to pass that Shez did

11
00:13:55,0 --> 00:13:55,0
remember the destruction of his

12
00:13:55,0 --> 00:13:55,0
fathers, and he did build up a

13
00:13:55,0 --> 00:13:55,0
righteous kingdom; for he remembered what

14
00:13:55,0 --> 00:13:55,0
the Lord had done in bringing

15
00:13:55,0 --> 00:13:55,0
Jared and his brother across the deep;

16
00:13:55,0 --> 00:13:55,0
and he did walk in the ways of the

17
00:13:55,0 --> 00:13:27,
Lord; and he begat sons and daughters.

18
00:13:27,0 --> 00:13:27,0
3 And his eldest son, whose name

19
00:13:27,0 --> 00:13:27,0
was Shez, did rebel against

20
00:13:27,0 --> 00:13:27,0
him; nevertheless, Shez was smitten

21
00:13:27,0 --> 00:13:27,0
by the hand of a robber,

22
00:13:27,0 --> 00:13:27,0
because of his exceeding riches, which

23
00:13:27,0 --> 00:12:59,
brought peace again unto his father.

24
00:12:59,0 --> 00:12:59,0
4 And it came to pass that his

25
00:12:59,0 --> 00:12:59,0
father did build up many

26
00:12:59,0 --> 00:12:59,0
cities upon the face of the land,

27
00:12:59,0 --> 00:12:59,0
and the people began again to

28
00:12:59,0 --> 00:12:59,0
spread over all the face of

29
00:12:59,0 --> 00:12:59,0
the land. And Shez did live to

30
00:12:59,0 --> 00:12:59,0
an exceedingly old age; and he

31
00:12:59,0 --> 00:12:59,0
begat Riplakish. And he died,

32
00:12:59,0 --> 00:15:11,
and Riplakish reigned in his stead.

33
00:15:11,0 --> 00:15:11,0
5 And it came to pass that

34
00:15:11,0 --> 00:15:11,0
Riplakish did not do that

35
00:15:11,0 --> 00:15:11,0
which was right in the sight

36
00:15:11,0 --> 00:15:11,0
of the Lord, for he did

37
00:15:11,0 --> 00:15:11,0
have many wives and

38
00:15:11,0 --> 00:15:11,0
concubines, and did lay that upon

39
00:15:11,0 --> 00:15:11,0
men’s shoulders which was

40
00:15:11,0 --> 00:15:11,0
grievous to be borne; yea, he

41
00:15:11,0 --> 00:15:11,0
did tax them with heavy

42
00:15:11,0 --> 00:15:11,0
taxes; and with the taxes he

43
00:15:11,0 --> 00:30:39,
did build many spacious buildings.

44
00:30:39,0 --> 00:30:39,0
6 And he did erect him an

45
00:30:39,0 --> 00:30:39,0
exceedingly beautiful

46
00:30:39,0 --> 00:30:39,0
throne; and he did build many

47
00:30:39,0 --> 00:30:39,0
prisons, and whoso would

48
00:30:39,0 --> 00:30:39,0
not be subject unto taxes

49
00:30:39,0 --> 00:30:39,0
he did cast into prison;

50
00:30:39,0 --> 00:30:39,0
and whoso was not able to

51
00:30:39,0 --> 00:30:39,0
pay taxes he did cast into

52
00:30:39,0 --> 00:30:39,0
prison; and he did cause

53
00:30:39,0 --> 00:30:39,0
that they should labor

54
00:30:39,0 --> 00:30:39,0
continually for their support;

55
00:30:39,0 --> 00:30:39,0
and whoso refused to labor

56
00:30:39,0 --> 00:36:49,
he did cause to be put to death.

57
00:36:49,0 --> 00:36:49,0
7 Wherefore he did

58
00:36:49,0 --> 00:36:49,0
obtain all his fine work,

59
00:36:49,0 --> 00:36:49,0
yea, even his fine gold he

60
00:36:49,0 --> 00:36:49,0
did cause to be refined

61
00:36:49,0 --> 00:36:49,0
in prison; and all

62
00:36:49,0 --> 00:36:49,0
manner of fine workmanship he

63
00:36:49,0 --> 00:36:49,0
did cause to be wrought

64
00:36:49,0 --> 00:36:49,0
in prison. And it came

65
00:36:49,0 --> 00:36:49,0
to pass that he did

66
00:36:49,0 --> 00:36:49,0
afflict the people with his

67
00:36:49,0 --> 00:46:16,
whoredoms and abominations.

68
00:46:16,0 --> 00:46:16,0
8 And when he had

69
00:46:16,0 --> 00:46:16,0
reigned for the space of

70
00:46:16,0 --> 00:46:16,0
forty and two years

71
00:46:16,0 --> 00:46:16,0
the people did rise

72
00:46:16,0 --> 00:46:16,0
up in rebellion

73
00:46:16,0 --> 00:46:16,0
against him; and there

74
00:46:16,0 --> 00:46:16,0
began to be war again in

75
00:46:16,0 --> 00:46:16,0
the land, insomuch

76
00:46:16,0 --> 00:46:16,0
that Riplakish was

77
00:46:16,0 --> 00:46:16,0
killed, and his

78
00:46:16,0 --> 00:48:28,
descendants were driven out of the land.

79
00:48:28,0 --> 00:48:28,0
9 And it came to

80
00:48:28,0 --> 00:48:28,0
pass after the space of

81
00:48:28,0 --> 00:48:28,0
many years,

82
00:48:28,0 --> 00:48:28,0
Morianton, (he being a

83
00:48:28,0 --> 00:48:28,0
descendant of Riplakish)

84
00:48:28,0 --> 00:48:28,0
gathered together

85
00:48:28,0 --> 00:48:28,0
an army of outcasts,

86
00:48:28,0 --> 00:48:28,0
and went forth and

87
00:48:28,0 --> 00:48:28,0
gave battle unto the

88
00:48:28,0 --> 00:48:28,0
people; and he

89
00:48:28,0 --> 00:48:28,0
gained power over many

90
00:48:28,0 --> 00:48:28,0
cities; and the war

91
00:48:28,0 --> 00:48:28,0
became exceedingly

92
00:48:28,0 --> 00:48:28,0
sore, and did last for

93
00:48:28,0 --> 00:48:28,0
the space of many

94
00:48:28,0 --> 00:48:28,0
years; and he did gain

95
00:48:28,0 --> 00:48:28,0
power over all the

96
00:48:28,0 --> 00:48:28,0
land, and did

97
00:48:28,0 --> 00:54:39,
establish himself king over all the land.

98
00:54:39,0 --> 00:54:39,0
10 And after that

99
00:54:39,0 --> 00:54:39,0
he had established

100
00:54:39,0 --> 00:54:39,0
himself king he

101
00:54:39,0 --> 00:54:39,0
did ease the burden

102
00:54:39,0 --> 00:54:39,0
of the people, by

103
00:54:39,0 --> 00:54:39,0
which he did gain

104
00:54:39,0 --> 00:54:39,0
favor in the eyes

105
00:54:39,0 --> 00:54:39,0
of the people,

106
00:54:39,0 --> 00:54:39,0
and they did anoint

107
00:54:39,0 --> 00:59:50,
him to be their king.

108
00:59:50,0 --> 00:59:50,0
11 And he did do

109
00:59:50,0 --> 00:59:50,0
justice unto

110
00:59:50,0 --> 00:59:50,0
the people, but

111
00:59:50,0 --> 00:59:50,0
not unto himself

112
00:59:50,0 --> 00:59:50,0
because of his

113
00:59:50,0 --> 00:59:50,0
many whoredoms;

114
00:59:50,0 --> 00:59:50,0
wherefore he was

115
00:59:50,0 --> 00:59:50,0
cut off from the

116
00:59:50,0 --> 01:12:59,
presence of the Lord.

117
01:12:59,0 --> 01:12:59,0
12 And it came

118
01:12:59,0 --> 01:12:59,0
to pass that

119
01:12:59,0 --> 01:12:59,0
Morianton built

120
01:12:59,0 --> 01:12:59,0
up many cities,

121
01:12:59,0 --> 01:12:59,0
and the people

122
01:12:59,0 --> 01:12:59,0
became

123
01:12:59,0 --> 01:12:59,0
exceedingly rich under

124
01:12:59,0 --> 01:12:59,0
his reign, both

125
01:12:59,0 --> 01:12:59,0
in buildings,

126
01:12:59,0 --> 01:12:59,0
and in gold and

127
01:12:59,0 --> 01:12:59,0
silver, and in

128
01:12:59,0 --> 01:12:59,0
raising grain,

129
01:12:59,0 --> 01:12:59,0
and in flocks,

130
01:12:59,0 --> 01:12:59,0
and herds, and

131
01:12:59,0 --> 01:12:59,0
such things

132
01:12:59,0 --> 01:12:59,0
which had been

133
01:12:59,0 --> 01:15:41,
restored unto them.

134
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
13 And

135
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
Morianton did live to

136
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
an

137
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
exceedingly great age,

138
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
and then he

139
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
begat Kim; and

140
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
Kim did reign in

141
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
the stead of

142
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
his father;

143
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
and he did reign

144
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
eight years,

145
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
and his father

146
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
died. And it

147
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
came to pass

148
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
that Kim did

149
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
not reign in

150
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
righteousness,

151
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
wherefore he was

152
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:55,
not favored of the Lord.

153
01:15:55,0 --> 01:15:55,0
14 And his

154
01:15:55,0 --> 01:15:55,0
brother did

155
01:15:55,0 --> 01:15:55,0
rise up in

156
01:15:55,0 --> 01:15:55,0
rebellion against

157
01:15:55,0 --> 01:15:55,0
him, by which

158
01:15:55,0 --> 01:15:55,0
he did bring

159
01:15:55,0 --> 01:15:55,0
him into

160
01:15:55,0 --> 01:15:55,0
captivity; and

161
01:15:55,0 --> 01:15:55,0
he did remain

162
01:15:55,0 --> 01:15:55,0
in captivity

163
01:15:55,0 --> 01:15:55,0
all his days;

164
01:15:55,0 --> 01:15:55,0
and he begat

165
01:15:55,0 --> 01:15:55,0
sons and

166
01:15:55,0 --> 01:15:55,0
daughters in

167
01:15:55,0 --> 01:15:55,0
captivity, and

168
01:15:55,0 --> 01:15:55,0
in his old age

169
01:15:55,0 --> 01:15:41,
he begat Levi; and he died.

170
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
15 And it

171
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
came to pass

172
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
that Levi did

173
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
serve in

174
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
captivity

175
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
after the death

176
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
of his

177
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
father, for the

178
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
space of

179
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
forty and two

180
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
years. And he

181
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
did make war

182
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
against the

183
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
king of the

184
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
land, by

185
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
which he did

186
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
obtain unto

187
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:55,
himself the kingdom.

188
01:15:55,0 --> 01:15:55,0
16 And

189
01:15:55,0 --> 01:15:55,0
after he had

190
01:15:55,0 --> 01:15:55,0
obtained unto

191
01:15:55,0 --> 01:15:55,0
himself

192
01:15:55,0 --> 01:15:55,0
the kingdom

193
01:15:55,0 --> 01:15:55,0
he did that

194
01:15:55,0 --> 01:15:55,0
which was

195
01:15:55,0 --> 01:15:55,0
right in the

196
01:15:55,0 --> 01:15:55,0
sight of

197
01:15:55,0 --> 01:15:55,0
the Lord;

198
01:15:55,0 --> 01:15:55,0
and the

199
01:15:55,0 --> 01:15:55,0
people did

200
01:15:55,0 --> 01:15:55,0
prosper in the

201
01:15:55,0 --> 01:15:55,0
land; and he

202
01:15:55,0 --> 01:15:55,0
did live

203
01:15:55,0 --> 01:15:55,0
to a good

204
01:15:55,0 --> 01:15:55,0
old age, and

205
01:15:55,0 --> 01:15:55,0
begat sons

206
01:15:55,0 --> 01:15:55,0
and

207
01:15:55,0 --> 01:15:55,0
daughters; and he

208
01:15:55,0 --> 01:15:55,0
also begat

209
01:15:55,0 --> 01:15:55,0
Corom, whom

210
01:15:55,0 --> 01:15:41,
he anointed king in his stead.

211
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
17 And it

212
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
came to pass

213
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
that Corom

214
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
did that

215
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
which was

216
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
good in the

217
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
sight of the

218
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
Lord all

219
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
his days;

220
01:15:41,0 --> 01:15:41,0
