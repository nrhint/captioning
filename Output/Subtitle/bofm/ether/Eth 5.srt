Chapter 5 Three witnesses and the work

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
itself will stand as a testimony of

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:04:13,
the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon. 

4
00:04:13,0 --> 00:04:13,0
1 And now I, Moroni, have written

5
00:04:13,0 --> 00:04:13,0
the words which were commanded me,

6
00:04:13,0 --> 00:04:13,0
according to my memory; and I have

7
00:04:13,0 --> 00:04:13,0
told you the things which I have

8
00:04:13,0 --> 00:04:13,0
sealed up; therefore touch them not in

9
00:04:13,0 --> 00:04:13,0
order that ye may translate; for

10
00:04:13,0 --> 00:04:13,0
that thing is forbidden you, except

11
00:04:13,0 --> 00:09:24,
by and by it shall be wisdom in God.

12
00:09:24,0 --> 00:09:24,0
2 And behold, ye may be

13
00:09:24,0 --> 00:09:24,0
privileged that ye may show the

14
00:09:24,0 --> 00:09:24,0
plates unto those who shall

15
00:09:24,0 --> 00:11:36,
assist to bring forth this work;

16
00:11:36,0 --> 00:11:36,0
3 And unto three shall

17
00:11:36,0 --> 00:11:36,0
they be shown by the

18
00:11:36,0 --> 00:11:36,0
power of God; wherefore they

19
00:11:36,0 --> 00:11:36,0
shall know of a surety

20
00:11:36,0 --> 00:16:05,
that these things are true.

21
00:16:05,0 --> 00:16:05,0
4 And in the mouth of

22
00:16:05,0 --> 00:16:05,0
three witnesses shall

23
00:16:05,0 --> 00:16:05,0
these things be

24
00:16:05,0 --> 00:16:05,0
established; and the testimony

25
00:16:05,0 --> 00:16:05,0
of three, and this work,

26
00:16:05,0 --> 00:16:05,0
in the which shall be

27
00:16:05,0 --> 00:16:05,0
shown forth the power

28
00:16:05,0 --> 00:16:05,0
of God and also his

29
00:16:05,0 --> 00:16:05,0
word, of which the Father,

30
00:16:05,0 --> 00:16:05,0
and the Son, and the

31
00:16:05,0 --> 00:16:05,0
Holy Ghost bear

32
00:16:05,0 --> 00:16:05,0
recordâ€”and all this shall stand

33
00:16:05,0 --> 00:16:05,0
as a testimony against

34
00:16:05,0 --> 00:27:12,
the world at the last day.

35
00:27:12,0 --> 00:27:12,0
5 And if it so be

36
00:27:12,0 --> 00:27:12,0
that they repent and

37
00:27:12,0 --> 00:27:12,0
come unto the Father in

38
00:27:12,0 --> 00:27:12,0
the name of Jesus,

39
00:27:12,0 --> 00:27:12,0
they shall be received

40
00:27:12,0 --> 00:34:56,
into the kingdom of God.

41
00:34:56,0 --> 00:34:56,0
6 And now, if I

42
00:34:56,0 --> 00:34:56,0
have no authority for

43
00:34:56,0 --> 00:34:56,0
these things, judge

44
00:34:56,0 --> 00:34:56,0
ye; for ye shall

45
00:34:56,0 --> 00:34:56,0
know that I have

46
00:34:56,0 --> 00:34:56,0
authority when ye

47
00:34:56,0 --> 00:34:56,0
shall see me, and we

48
00:34:56,0 --> 00:34:56,0
shall stand before

49
00:34:56,0 --> 00:42:26,
God at the last day. Amen.
