00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:07,667
Chapter 5 Three witnesses and the work itself will

2
00:00:07,667 --> 00:00:15,334
 stand as a testimony of the truthfulness of the

3
00:00:15,334 --> 00:00:23,001
 Book of Mormon.

4
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:29,424
1 And now I, Moroni, have written the words which

5
00:00:29,424 --> 00:00:34,924
 were commanded me, according to my memory; and I

6
00:00:34,924 --> 00:00:40,424
 have told you the things which I have sealed up;

7
00:00:40,424 --> 00:00:45,924
 therefore touch them not in order that ye may

8
00:00:45,924 --> 00:00:51,424
 translate; for that thing is forbidden you, except by

9
00:00:51,424 --> 00:00:56,924
 and by it shall be wisdom in God

10
00:00:56,39 --> 00:01:01,057
2 And behold, ye may be privileged that ye may

11
00:01:01,057 --> 00:01:05,724
 show the plates unto those who shall assist to bring

12
00:01:05,724 --> 00:01:10,391
 forth this work

13
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:15,437
3 And unto three shall they be shown by the power

14
00:01:15,437 --> 00:01:20,437
 of God; wherefore they shall know of a surety that

15
00:01:20,437 --> 00:01:25,437
 these things are true

16
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:31,705
4 And in the mouth of three witnesses shall these

17
00:01:31,705 --> 00:01:37,991
 things be established; and the testimony of three,

18
00:01:37,991 --> 00:01:44,277
 and this work, in the which shall be shown forth

19
00:01:44,277 --> 00:01:50,563
 the power of God and also his word, of which the

20
00:01:50,563 --> 00:01:56,849
 Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost bear

21
00:01:56,849 --> 00:02:03,135
 recordâ€”and all this shall stand as a testimony against

22
00:02:03,135 --> 00:02:09,421
 the world at the last day

23
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:14,363
5 And if it so be that they repent and come unto

24
00:02:14,363 --> 00:02:19,363
 the Father in the name of Jesus, they shall be

25
00:02:19,363 --> 00:02:24,363
 received into the kingdom of God

26
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:27,128
6 And now, if I have no authority for these

27
00:02:27,128 --> 00:02:29,878
 things, judge ye; for ye shall know that I have

28
00:02:29,878 --> 00:02:32,628
 authority when ye shall see me, and we shall stand before

29
00:02:32,628 --> 00:02:35,378
 God at the last day. Amen.
