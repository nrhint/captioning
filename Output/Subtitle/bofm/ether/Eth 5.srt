Chapter 5 Three witnesses and the work

2
00:00:06,667 --> 00:00:13,334
itself will stand as a testimony of

3
00:00:13,334 --> 00:00:20,32
the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon. 

4
00:00:20,32 --> 00:00:21,945
1 And now I, Moroni, have written

5
00:00:21,945 --> 00:00:23,57
the words which were commanded me,

6
00:00:23,57 --> 00:00:25,195
according to my memory; and I have

7
00:00:25,195 --> 00:00:26,82
told you the things which I have

8
00:00:26,82 --> 00:00:28,445
sealed up; therefore touch them not in

9
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,07
order that ye may translate; for

10
00:00:30,07 --> 00:00:31,695
that thing is forbidden you, except

11
00:00:31,695 --> 00:00:33,7
by and by it shall be wisdom in God.

12
00:00:33,7 --> 00:00:39,2
2 And behold, ye may be

13
00:00:39,2 --> 00:00:44,7
privileged that ye may show the

14
00:00:44,7 --> 00:00:50,2
plates unto those who shall

15
00:00:50,2 --> 00:00:55,956
assist to bring forth this work;

16
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:58,156
3 And unto three shall

17
00:00:58,156 --> 00:01:00,356
they be shown by the

18
00:01:00,356 --> 00:01:02,556
power of God; wherefore they

19
00:01:02,556 --> 00:01:04,756
shall know of a surety

20
00:01:04,756 --> 00:01:06,3
that these things are true.

21
00:01:06,3 --> 00:01:06,443
4 And in the mouth of

22
00:01:06,443 --> 00:01:06,586
three witnesses shall

23
00:01:06,586 --> 00:01:06,729
these things be

24
00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:06,872
established; and the testimony

25
00:01:06,872 --> 00:01:07,015
of three, and this work,

26
00:01:07,015 --> 00:01:07,158
in the which shall be

27
00:01:07,158 --> 00:01:07,301
shown forth the power

28
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:07,444
of God and also his

29
00:01:07,444 --> 00:01:07,587
word, of which the Father,

30
00:01:07,587 --> 00:01:07,73
and the Son, and the

31
00:01:07,73 --> 00:01:07,873
Holy Ghost bear

32
00:01:07,873 --> 00:01:08,016
recordâ€”and all this shall stand

33
00:01:08,016 --> 00:01:08,159
as a testimony against

34
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:08,702
the world at the last day.

35
00:01:08,702 --> 00:01:13,035
5 And if it so be

36
00:01:13,035 --> 00:01:17,368
that they repent and

37
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:21,701
come unto the Father in

38
00:01:21,701 --> 00:01:26,034
the name of Jesus,

39
00:01:26,034 --> 00:01:30,367
they shall be received

40
00:01:30,367 --> 00:01:34,995
into the kingdom of God.

41
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:36,217
6 And now, if I

42
00:01:36,217 --> 00:01:37,439
have no authority for

43
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,661
these things, judge

44
00:01:38,661 --> 00:01:39,883
ye; for ye shall

45
00:01:39,883 --> 00:01:41,105
know that I have

46
00:01:41,105 --> 00:01:42,327
authority when ye

47
00:01:42,327 --> 00:01:43,549
shall see me, and we

48
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:44,771
shall stand before

49
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:45,372
God at the last day. Amen.
