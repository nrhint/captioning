00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:10,25
Chapter 6 The Jaredite barges are driven by the

2
00:00:10,25 --> 00:00:20,5
 winds to the promised land—The people praise the

3
00:00:20,5 --> 00:00:30,75
 Lord for His goodness—Orihah is appointed king over

4
00:00:30,75 --> 00:00:41,0
 them—Jared and his brother die.

5
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:50,208
1 And now I, Moroni, proceed to give the record of

6
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:59,208
 Jared and his brother

7
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:04,049
2 For it came to pass after the Lord had prepared

8
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,906
 the stones which the brother of Jared had carried

9
00:01:08,906 --> 00:01:13,763
 up into the mount, the brother of Jared came down

10
00:01:13,763 --> 00:01:18,62
 out of the mount, and he did put forth the stones

11
00:01:18,62 --> 00:01:23,477
 into the vessels which were prepared, one in each

12
00:01:23,477 --> 00:01:28,334
 end thereof; and behold, they did give light unto

13
00:01:28,334 --> 00:01:33,191
 the vessels

14
00:01:33,76 --> 00:01:39,51
3 And thus the Lord caused stones to shine in

15
00:01:39,51 --> 00:01:45,26
 darkness, to give light unto men, women, and children,

16
00:01:45,26 --> 00:01:51,01
 that they might not cross the great waters in

17
00:01:51,01 --> 00:01:56,76
 darkness

18
00:01:56,984 --> 00:02:02,984
4 And it came to pass that when they had prepared

19
00:02:02,984 --> 00:02:08,984
 all manner of food, that thereby they might

20
00:02:08,984 --> 00:02:14,984
 subsist upon the water, and also food for their flocks

21
00:02:14,984 --> 00:02:20,984
 and herds, and whatsoever beast or animal or fowl

22
00:02:20,984 --> 00:02:26,984
 that they should carry with them—and it came to

23
00:02:26,984 --> 00:02:32,984
 pass that when they had done all these things they

24
00:02:32,984 --> 00:02:38,984
 got aboard of their vessels or barges, and set forth

25
00:02:38,984 --> 00:02:44,984
 into the sea, commending themselves unto the Lord

26
00:02:44,984 --> 00:02:50,984
 their God

27
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:54,737
5 And it came to pass that the Lord God caused

28
00:02:54,737 --> 00:02:59,337
 that there should be a furious wind blow upon the

29
00:02:59,337 --> 00:03:03,937
 face of the waters, towards the promised land; and

30
00:03:03,937 --> 00:03:08,537
 thus they were tossed upon the waves of the sea

31
00:03:08,537 --> 00:03:13,137
 before the wind

32
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:19,227
6 And it came to pass that they were many times

33
00:03:19,227 --> 00:03:24,627
 buried in the depths of the sea, because of the

34
00:03:24,627 --> 00:03:30,027
 mountain waves which broke upon them, and also the

35
00:03:30,027 --> 00:03:35,427
 great and terrible tempests which were caused by the

36
00:03:35,427 --> 00:03:40,827
 fierceness of the wind

37
00:03:40,42 --> 00:03:46,991
7 And it came to pass that when they were buried

38
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:53,562
 in the deep there was no water that could hurt

39
00:03:53,562 --> 00:04:00,133
 them, their vessels being tight like unto a dish, and

40
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:06,704
 also they were tight like unto the ark of Noah;

41
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:13,275
 therefore when they were encompassed about by many

42
00:04:13,275 --> 00:04:19,846
 waters they did cry unto the Lord, and he did bring

43
00:04:19,846 --> 00:04:26,417
 them forth again upon the top of the waters

44
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,649
8 And it came to pass that the wind did never

45
00:04:30,649 --> 00:04:34,899
 cease to blow towards the promised land while they

46
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:39,149
 were upon the waters; and thus they were driven forth

47
00:04:39,149 --> 00:04:43,399
 before the wind

48
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:48,517
9 And they did sing praises unto the Lord; yea,

49
00:04:48,517 --> 00:04:53,517
 the brother of Jared did sing praises unto the Lord,

50
00:04:53,517 --> 00:04:58,517
 and he did thank and praise the Lord all the day

51
00:04:58,517 --> 00:05:03,517
 long; and when the night came, they did not cease

52
00:05:03,517 --> 00:05:08,517
 to praise the Lord

53
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:15,708
10 And thus they were driven forth; and no monster

54
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:22,908
 of the sea could break them, neither whale that

55
00:05:22,908 --> 00:05:30,108
 could mar them; and they did have light

56
00:05:30,108 --> 00:05:37,308
 continually, whether it was above the water or under the

57
00:05:37,308 --> 00:05:44,508
 water

58
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:50,477
11 And thus they were driven forth, three hundred

59
00:05:50,477 --> 00:05:56,477
 and forty and four days upon the water

60
00:05:56,79 --> 00:06:02,361
12 And they did land upon the shore of the

61
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:07,932
 promised land. And when they had set their feet upon the

62
00:06:07,932 --> 00:06:13,503
 shores of the promised land they bowed themselves

63
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:19,074
 down upon the face of the land, and did humble

64
00:06:19,074 --> 00:06:24,645
 themselves before the Lord, and did shed tears of joy

65
00:06:24,645 --> 00:06:30,216
 before the Lord, because of the multitude of his

66
00:06:30,216 --> 00:06:35,787
 tender mercies over them

67
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:41,195
13 And it came to pass that they went forth upon

68
00:06:41,195 --> 00:06:46,695
 the face of the land, and began to till the earth

69
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:56,973
14 And Jared had four sons; and they were called

70
00:06:56,973 --> 00:07:06,973
 Jacom, and Gilgah, and Mahah, and Orihah

71
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:10,693
15 And the brother of Jared also begat sons and

72
00:07:10,693 --> 00:07:14,693
 daughters

73
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:19,634
16 And the friends of Jared and his brother were

74
00:07:19,634 --> 00:07:24,834
 in number about twenty and two souls; and they also

75
00:07:24,834 --> 00:07:30,034
 begat sons and daughters before they came to the

76
00:07:30,034 --> 00:07:35,234
 promised land; and therefore they began to be

77
00:07:35,234 --> 00:07:40,434
 many

78
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:46,893
17 And they were taught to walk humbly before the

79
00:07:46,893 --> 00:07:53,393
 Lord; and they were also taught from on high

80
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:57,423
18 And it came to pass that they began to spread

81
00:07:57,423 --> 00:08:01,673
 upon the face of the land, and to multiply and to

82
00:08:01,673 --> 00:08:05,923
 till the earth; and they did wax strong in the

83
00:08:05,923 --> 00:08:10,173
 land

84
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:16,591
19 And the brother of Jared began to be old, and

85
00:08:16,591 --> 00:08:22,258
 saw that he must soon go down to the grave;

86
00:08:22,258 --> 00:08:27,925
 wherefore he said unto Jared: Let us gather together our

87
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:33,592
 people that we may number them, that we may know

88
00:08:33,592 --> 00:08:39,259
 of them what they will desire of us before we go

89
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:44,926
 down to our graves

90
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:49,224
20 And accordingly the people were gathered

91
00:08:49,224 --> 00:08:54,024
 together. Now the number of the sons and the daughters

92
00:08:54,024 --> 00:08:58,824
 of the brother of Jared were twenty and two souls;

93
00:08:58,824 --> 00:09:03,624
 and the number of sons and daughters of Jared were

94
00:09:03,624 --> 00:09:08,424
 twelve, he having four sons

95
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:13,115
21 And it came to pass that they did number their

96
00:09:13,115 --> 00:09:17,515
 people; and after that they had numbered them,

97
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:21,915
 they did desire of them the things which they would

98
00:09:21,915 --> 00:09:26,315
 that they should do before they went down to their

99
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:30,715
 graves

100
00:09:30,67 --> 00:09:35,337
22 And it came to pass that the people desired of

101
00:09:35,337 --> 00:09:40,004
 them that they should anoint one of their sons to

102
00:09:40,004 --> 00:09:44,671
 be a king over them

103
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:50,618
23 And now behold, this was grievous unto them.

104
00:09:50,618 --> 00:09:56,285
 And the brother of Jared said unto them: Surely this

105
00:09:56,285 --> 00:10:01,952
 thing leadeth into captivity

106
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:07,234
24 But Jared said unto his brother: Suffer them

107
00:10:07,234 --> 00:10:12,734
 that they may have a king. And therefore he said

108
00:10:12,734 --> 00:10:18,234
 unto them: Choose ye out from among our sons a king,

109
00:10:18,234 --> 00:10:23,734
 even whom ye will

110
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:28,742
25 And it came to pass that they chose even the

111
00:10:28,742 --> 00:10:34,028
 firstborn of the brother of Jared; and his name was

112
00:10:34,028 --> 00:10:39,314
 Pagag. And it came to pass that he refused and

113
00:10:39,314 --> 00:10:44,6
 would not be their king. And the people would that

114
00:10:44,6 --> 00:10:49,886
 his father should constrain him, but his father

115
00:10:49,886 --> 00:10:55,172
 would not; and he commanded them that they should

116
00:10:55,172 --> 00:11:00,458
 constrain no man to be their king

117
00:11:00,66 --> 00:11:09,16
26 And it came to pass that they chose all the

118
00:11:09,16 --> 00:11:17,66
 brothers of Pagag, and they would not

119
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:22,777
27 And it came to pass that neither would the sons

120
00:11:22,777 --> 00:11:27,777
 of Jared, even all save it were one; and Orihah

121
00:11:27,777 --> 00:11:32,777
 was anointed to be king over the people

122
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:38,058
28 And he began to reign, and the people began to

123
00:11:38,058 --> 00:11:44,058
 prosper; and they became exceedingly rich

124
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:48,837
29 And it came to pass that Jared died, and his

125
00:11:48,837 --> 00:11:52,837
 brother also

126
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:57,379
30 And it came to pass that Orihah did walk humbly

127
00:11:57,379 --> 00:12:02,179
 before the Lord, and did remember how great

128
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:06,979
 things the Lord had done for his father, and also

129
00:12:06,979 --> 00:12:11,779
 taught his people how great things the Lord had done

130
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:16,579
 for their fathers.
