00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 6 The Jaredite barges are driven by

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the winds to the promised land—The people

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
praise the Lord for His goodness—Orihah is

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:03:45,
appointed king over them—Jared and his brother die. 

5
00:03:45,0 --> 00:03:45,0
1 And now I, Moroni, proceed to give

6
00:03:45,0 --> 00:09:13,
the record of Jared and his brother.

7
00:09:13,0 --> 00:09:13,0
2 For it came to pass after the

8
00:09:13,0 --> 00:09:13,0
Lord had prepared the stones which

9
00:09:13,0 --> 00:09:13,0
the brother of Jared had carried up

10
00:09:13,0 --> 00:09:13,0
into the mount, the brother of

11
00:09:13,0 --> 00:09:13,0
Jared came down out of the mount,

12
00:09:13,0 --> 00:09:13,0
and he did put forth the stones into

13
00:09:13,0 --> 00:09:13,0
the vessels which were prepared,

14
00:09:13,0 --> 00:09:13,0
one in each end thereof; and

15
00:09:13,0 --> 00:10:25,
behold, they did give light unto the vessels.

16
00:10:25,0 --> 00:10:25,0
3 And thus the Lord caused

17
00:10:25,0 --> 00:10:25,0
stones to shine in darkness, to

18
00:10:25,0 --> 00:10:25,0
give light unto men, women, and

19
00:10:25,0 --> 00:10:25,0
children, that they might not

20
00:10:25,0 --> 00:12:23,
cross the great waters in darkness.

21
00:12:23,0 --> 00:12:23,0
4 And it came to pass that

22
00:12:23,0 --> 00:12:23,0
when they had prepared all

23
00:12:23,0 --> 00:12:23,0
manner of food, that thereby they

24
00:12:23,0 --> 00:12:23,0
might subsist upon the

25
00:12:23,0 --> 00:12:23,0
water, and also food for their

26
00:12:23,0 --> 00:12:23,0
flocks and herds, and whatsoever

27
00:12:23,0 --> 00:12:23,0
beast or animal or fowl that

28
00:12:23,0 --> 00:12:23,0
they should carry with

29
00:12:23,0 --> 00:12:23,0
them—and it came to pass that when

30
00:12:23,0 --> 00:12:23,0
they had done all these

31
00:12:23,0 --> 00:12:23,0
things they got aboard of their

32
00:12:23,0 --> 00:12:23,0
vessels or barges, and set

33
00:12:23,0 --> 00:12:23,0
forth into the sea, commending

34
00:12:23,0 --> 00:17:33,
themselves unto the Lord their God.

35
00:17:33,0 --> 00:17:33,0
5 And it came to pass that

36
00:17:33,0 --> 00:17:33,0
the Lord God caused that

37
00:17:33,0 --> 00:17:33,0
there should be a furious

38
00:17:33,0 --> 00:17:33,0
wind blow upon the face of

39
00:17:33,0 --> 00:17:33,0
the waters, towards the

40
00:17:33,0 --> 00:17:33,0
promised land; and thus

41
00:17:33,0 --> 00:17:33,0
they were tossed upon the

42
00:17:33,0 --> 00:17:05,
waves of the sea before the wind.

43
00:17:05,0 --> 00:17:05,0
6 And it came to pass

44
00:17:05,0 --> 00:17:05,0
that they were many times

45
00:17:05,0 --> 00:17:05,0
buried in the depths of

46
00:17:05,0 --> 00:17:05,0
the sea, because of the

47
00:17:05,0 --> 00:17:05,0
mountain waves which

48
00:17:05,0 --> 00:17:05,0
broke upon them, and also

49
00:17:05,0 --> 00:17:05,0
the great and terrible

50
00:17:05,0 --> 00:17:05,0
tempests which were caused

51
00:17:05,0 --> 00:18:17,
by the fierceness of the wind.

52
00:18:17,0 --> 00:18:17,0
7 And it came to pass

53
00:18:17,0 --> 00:18:17,0
that when they were

54
00:18:17,0 --> 00:18:17,0
buried in the deep there

55
00:18:17,0 --> 00:18:17,0
was no water that could

56
00:18:17,0 --> 00:18:17,0
hurt them, their vessels

57
00:18:17,0 --> 00:18:17,0
being tight like unto

58
00:18:17,0 --> 00:18:17,0
a dish, and also they

59
00:18:17,0 --> 00:18:17,0
were tight like unto the

60
00:18:17,0 --> 00:18:17,0
ark of Noah; therefore

61
00:18:17,0 --> 00:18:17,0
when they were

62
00:18:17,0 --> 00:18:17,0
encompassed about by many

63
00:18:17,0 --> 00:18:17,0
waters they did cry unto

64
00:18:17,0 --> 00:18:17,0
the Lord, and he did

65
00:18:17,0 --> 00:18:17,0
bring them forth again upon

66
00:18:17,0 --> 00:20:29,
the top of the waters.

67
00:20:29,0 --> 00:20:29,0
8 And it came to

68
00:20:29,0 --> 00:20:29,0
pass that the wind did

69
00:20:29,0 --> 00:20:29,0
never cease to blow

70
00:20:29,0 --> 00:20:29,0
towards the promised

71
00:20:29,0 --> 00:20:29,0
land while they

72
00:20:29,0 --> 00:20:29,0
were upon the waters;

73
00:20:29,0 --> 00:20:29,0
and thus they were

74
00:20:29,0 --> 00:26:40,
driven forth before the wind.

75
00:26:40,0 --> 00:26:40,0
9 And they did sing

76
00:26:40,0 --> 00:26:40,0
praises unto the

77
00:26:40,0 --> 00:26:40,0
Lord; yea, the

78
00:26:40,0 --> 00:26:40,0
brother of Jared did

79
00:26:40,0 --> 00:26:40,0
sing praises unto the

80
00:26:40,0 --> 00:26:40,0
Lord, and he did

81
00:26:40,0 --> 00:26:40,0
thank and praise the

82
00:26:40,0 --> 00:26:40,0
Lord all the day

83
00:26:40,0 --> 00:26:40,0
long; and when the

84
00:26:40,0 --> 00:26:40,0
night came, they did

85
00:26:40,0 --> 00:33:48,
not cease to praise the Lord.

86
00:33:48,0 --> 00:33:48,0
10 And thus they

87
00:33:48,0 --> 00:33:48,0
were driven forth;

88
00:33:48,0 --> 00:33:48,0
and no monster of

89
00:33:48,0 --> 00:33:48,0
the sea could

90
00:33:48,0 --> 00:33:48,0
break them, neither

91
00:33:48,0 --> 00:33:48,0
whale that could mar

92
00:33:48,0 --> 00:33:48,0
them; and they

93
00:33:48,0 --> 00:33:48,0
did have light

94
00:33:48,0 --> 00:33:48,0
continually, whether it

95
00:33:48,0 --> 00:33:48,0
was above the

96
00:33:48,0 --> 00:45:59,
water or under the water.

97
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
11 And thus they

98
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
were driven

99
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
forth, three hundred

100
00:45:59,0 --> 00:45:59,0
and forty and four

101
00:45:59,0 --> 00:51:09,
days upon the water.

102
00:51:09,0 --> 00:51:09,0
12 And they did

103
00:51:09,0 --> 00:51:09,0
land upon the

104
00:51:09,0 --> 00:51:09,0
shore of the

105
00:51:09,0 --> 00:51:09,0
promised land. And

106
00:51:09,0 --> 00:51:09,0
when they had set

107
00:51:09,0 --> 00:51:09,0
their feet upon

108
00:51:09,0 --> 00:51:09,0
the shores of

109
00:51:09,0 --> 00:51:09,0
the promised land

110
00:51:09,0 --> 00:51:09,0
they bowed

111
00:51:09,0 --> 00:51:09,0
themselves down upon

112
00:51:09,0 --> 00:51:09,0
the face of the

113
00:51:09,0 --> 00:51:09,0
land, and did

114
00:51:09,0 --> 00:51:09,0
humble themselves

115
00:51:09,0 --> 00:51:09,0
before the Lord,

116
00:51:09,0 --> 00:51:09,0
and did shed

117
00:51:09,0 --> 00:51:09,0
tears of joy

118
00:51:09,0 --> 00:51:09,0
before the Lord,

119
00:51:09,0 --> 00:51:09,0
because of the

120
00:51:09,0 --> 00:51:09,0
multitude of his

121
00:51:09,0 --> 00:54:39,
tender mercies over them.

122
00:54:39,0 --> 00:54:39,0
13 And it came

123
00:54:39,0 --> 00:54:39,0
to pass that

124
00:54:39,0 --> 00:54:39,0
they went

125
00:54:39,0 --> 00:54:39,0
forth upon the

126
00:54:39,0 --> 00:54:39,0
face of the land,

127
00:54:39,0 --> 00:54:39,0
and began to

128
00:54:39,0 --> 00:58:10,
till the earth.

129
00:58:10,0 --> 00:58:10,0
14 And Jared

130
00:58:10,0 --> 00:58:10,0
had four

131
00:58:10,0 --> 00:58:10,0
sons; and they

132
00:58:10,0 --> 00:58:10,0
were called

133
00:58:10,0 --> 00:58:10,0
Jacom, and

134
00:58:10,0 --> 00:58:10,0
Gilgah, and

135
00:58:10,0 --> 01:09:17,
Mahah, and Orihah.

136
01:09:17,0 --> 01:09:17,0
15 And the

137
01:09:17,0 --> 01:09:17,0
brother of

138
01:09:17,0 --> 01:09:17,0
Jared also

139
01:09:17,0 --> 01:09:17,0
begat sons

140
01:09:17,0 --> 01:24:45,
and daughters.

141
01:24:45,0 --> 01:24:45,0
16 And the

142
01:24:45,0 --> 01:24:45,0
friends

143
01:24:45,0 --> 01:24:45,0
of Jared

144
01:24:45,0 --> 01:24:45,0
and his

145
01:24:45,0 --> 01:24:45,0
brother were

146
01:24:45,0 --> 01:24:45,0
in number

147
01:24:45,0 --> 01:24:45,0
about

148
01:24:45,0 --> 01:24:45,0
twenty and two

149
01:24:45,0 --> 01:24:45,0
souls; and

150
01:24:45,0 --> 01:24:45,0
they also

151
01:24:45,0 --> 01:24:45,0
begat

152
01:24:45,0 --> 01:24:45,0
sons and

153
01:24:45,0 --> 01:24:45,0
daughters

154
01:24:45,0 --> 01:24:45,0
before they

155
01:24:45,0 --> 01:24:45,0
came to the

156
01:24:45,0 --> 01:24:45,0
promised

157
01:24:45,0 --> 01:24:45,0
land; and

158
01:24:45,0 --> 01:24:45,0
therefore

159
01:24:45,0 --> 01:36:28,
they began to be many.

160
01:36:28,0 --> 01:36:28,0
17 And

161
01:36:28,0 --> 01:36:28,0
they were

162
01:36:28,0 --> 01:36:28,0
taught to

163
01:36:28,0 --> 01:36:28,0
walk

164
01:36:28,0 --> 01:36:28,0
humbly before

165
01:36:28,0 --> 01:36:28,0
the

166
01:36:28,0 --> 01:36:28,0
Lord; and

167
01:36:28,0 --> 01:36:28,0
they were

168
01:36:28,0 --> 01:36:28,0
also taught

169
01:36:28,0 --> 01:42:39,
from on high.

170
01:42:39,0 --> 01:42:39,0
18 And

171
01:42:39,0 --> 01:42:39,0
it came

172
01:42:39,0 --> 01:42:39,0
to pass

173
01:42:39,0 --> 01:42:39,0
that they

174
01:42:39,0 --> 01:42:39,0
began

175
01:42:39,0 --> 01:42:39,0
to spread

176
01:42:39,0 --> 01:42:39,0
upon

177
01:42:39,0 --> 01:42:39,0
the face

178
01:42:39,0 --> 01:42:39,0
of the

179
01:42:39,0 --> 01:42:39,0
land, and

180
01:42:39,0 --> 01:42:39,0
to

181
01:42:39,0 --> 01:42:39,0
multiply and

182
01:42:39,0 --> 01:42:39,0
to till

183
01:42:39,0 --> 01:42:39,0
the

184
01:42:39,0 --> 01:42:39,0
earth; and

185
01:42:39,0 --> 01:42:39,0
they did

186
01:42:39,0 --> 01:49:06,
wax strong in the land.

187
01:49:06,0 --> 01:49:06,0
19 And

188
01:49:06,0 --> 01:49:06,0
the

189
01:49:06,0 --> 01:49:06,0
brother of

190
01:49:06,0 --> 01:49:06,0
Jared

191
01:49:06,0 --> 01:49:06,0
began

192
01:49:06,0 --> 01:49:06,0
to be

193
01:49:06,0 --> 01:49:06,0
old, and

194
01:49:06,0 --> 01:49:06,0
saw

195
01:49:06,0 --> 01:49:06,0
that he

196
01:49:06,0 --> 01:49:06,0
must soon

197
01:49:06,0 --> 01:49:06,0
go

198
01:49:06,0 --> 01:49:06,0
down to

199
01:49:06,0 --> 01:49:06,0
the

200
01:49:06,0 --> 01:49:06,0
grave;

201
01:49:06,0 --> 01:49:06,0
wherefore he

202
01:49:06,0 --> 01:49:06,0
said

203
01:49:06,0 --> 01:49:06,0
unto

204
01:49:06,0 --> 01:49:06,0
Jared: Let

205
01:49:06,0 --> 01:49:06,0
us

206
01:49:06,0 --> 01:49:06,0
gather

207
01:49:06,0 --> 01:49:06,0
together

208
01:49:06,0 --> 01:49:06,0
our

209
01:49:06,0 --> 01:49:06,0
people that

210
01:49:06,0 --> 01:49:06,0
we may

211
01:49:06,0 --> 01:49:06,0
number

212
01:49:06,0 --> 01:49:06,0
them,

213
01:49:06,0 --> 01:49:06,0
that we

214
01:49:06,0 --> 01:49:06,0
may

215
01:49:06,0 --> 01:49:06,0
know of

216
01:49:06,0 --> 01:49:06,0
them

217
01:49:06,0 --> 01:49:06,0
what they

218
01:49:06,0 --> 01:49:06,0
will

219
01:49:06,0 --> 01:49:06,0
desire of

220
01:49:06,0 --> 02:11:43,
us before we go down to our graves.

221
02:11:43,0 --> 02:11:43,0
20 And

222
02:11:43,0 --> 02:11:43,0


223
02:11:43,0 --> 02:11:43,0
accordingly

224
02:11:43,0 --> 02:11:43,0
the

225
