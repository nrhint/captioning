00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:05,25
Chapter 6 The Jaredite barges are driven by

2
00:00:05,25 --> 00:00:10,5
the winds to the promised land—The people

3
00:00:10,5 --> 00:00:15,75
praise the Lord for His goodness—Orihah is

4
00:00:15,75 --> 00:00:21,355
appointed king over them—Jared and his brother die. 

5
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:28,855
1 And now I, Moroni, proceed to give

6
00:00:28,855 --> 00:00:36,37
the record of Jared and his brother.

7
00:00:36,37 --> 00:00:36,814
2 For it came to pass after the

8
00:00:36,814 --> 00:00:37,258
Lord had prepared the stones which

9
00:00:37,258 --> 00:00:37,702
the brother of Jared had carried up

10
00:00:37,702 --> 00:00:38,146
into the mount, the brother of

11
00:00:38,146 --> 00:00:38,59
Jared came down out of the mount,

12
00:00:38,59 --> 00:00:39,034
and he did put forth the stones into

13
00:00:39,034 --> 00:00:39,478
the vessels which were prepared,

14
00:00:39,478 --> 00:00:39,922
one in each end thereof; and

15
00:00:39,922 --> 00:00:40,774
behold, they did give light unto the vessels.

16
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:42,174
3 And thus the Lord caused

17
00:00:42,174 --> 00:00:43,574
stones to shine in darkness, to

18
00:00:43,574 --> 00:00:44,974
give light unto men, women, and

19
00:00:44,974 --> 00:00:46,374
children, that they might not

20
00:00:46,374 --> 00:00:47,814
cross the great waters in darkness.

21
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:48,243
4 And it came to pass that

22
00:00:48,243 --> 00:00:48,672
when they had prepared all

23
00:00:48,672 --> 00:00:49,101
manner of food, that thereby they

24
00:00:49,101 --> 00:00:49,53
might subsist upon the

25
00:00:49,53 --> 00:00:49,959
water, and also food for their

26
00:00:49,959 --> 00:00:50,388
flocks and herds, and whatsoever

27
00:00:50,388 --> 00:00:50,817
beast or animal or fowl that

28
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:51,246
they should carry with

29
00:00:51,246 --> 00:00:51,675
them—and it came to pass that when

30
00:00:51,675 --> 00:00:52,104
they had done all these

31
00:00:52,104 --> 00:00:52,533
things they got aboard of their

32
00:00:52,533 --> 00:00:52,962
vessels or barges, and set

33
00:00:52,962 --> 00:00:53,391
forth into the sea, commending

34
00:00:53,391 --> 00:00:53,687
themselves unto the Lord their God.

35
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:54,562
5 And it came to pass that

36
00:00:54,562 --> 00:00:55,437
the Lord God caused that

37
00:00:55,437 --> 00:00:56,312
there should be a furious

38
00:00:56,312 --> 00:00:57,187
wind blow upon the face of

39
00:00:57,187 --> 00:00:58,062
the waters, towards the

40
00:00:58,062 --> 00:00:58,937
promised land; and thus

41
00:00:58,937 --> 00:00:59,812
they were tossed upon the

42
00:00:59,812 --> 00:01:00,027
waves of the sea before the wind.

43
00:01:00,027 --> 00:00:59,916
6 And it came to pass

44
00:00:59,916 --> 00:00:59,805
that they were many times

45
00:00:59,805 --> 00:00:59,694
buried in the depths of

46
00:00:59,694 --> 00:00:59,583
the sea, because of the

47
00:00:59,583 --> 00:00:59,472
mountain waves which

48
00:00:59,472 --> 00:00:59,361
broke upon them, and also

49
00:00:59,361 --> 00:00:59,25
the great and terrible

50
00:00:59,25 --> 00:00:59,139
tempests which were caused

51
00:00:59,139 --> 00:00:59,559
by the fierceness of the wind.

52
00:00:59,559 --> 00:00:59,627
7 And it came to pass

53
00:00:59,627 --> 00:00:59,694
that when they were

54
00:00:59,694 --> 00:00:59,761
buried in the deep there

55
00:00:59,761 --> 00:00:59,828
was no water that could

56
00:00:59,828 --> 00:00:59,895
hurt them, their vessels

57
00:00:59,895 --> 00:00:59,962
being tight like unto

58
00:00:59,962 --> 00:01:00,029
a dish, and also they

59
00:01:00,029 --> 00:01:00,096
were tight like unto the

60
00:01:00,096 --> 00:01:00,163
ark of Noah; therefore

61
00:01:00,163 --> 00:01:00,23
when they were

62
00:01:00,23 --> 00:01:00,297
encompassed about by many

63
00:01:00,297 --> 00:01:00,364
waters they did cry unto

64
00:01:00,364 --> 00:01:00,431
the Lord, and he did

65
00:01:00,431 --> 00:01:00,498
bring them forth again upon

66
00:01:00,498 --> 00:01:00,56
the top of the waters.

67
00:01:00,56 --> 00:01:00,81
8 And it came to

68
00:01:00,81 --> 00:01:01,06
pass that the wind did

69
00:01:01,06 --> 00:01:01,31
never cease to blow

70
00:01:01,31 --> 00:01:01,56
towards the promised

71
00:01:01,56 --> 00:01:01,81
land while they

72
00:01:01,81 --> 00:01:02,06
were upon the waters;

73
00:01:02,06 --> 00:01:02,31
and thus they were

74
00:01:02,31 --> 00:01:02,963
driven forth before the wind.

75
00:01:02,963 --> 00:01:05,599
9 And they did sing

76
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:08,235
praises unto the

77
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:10,871
Lord; yea, the

78
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:13,507
brother of Jared did

79
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:16,143
sing praises unto the

80
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:18,779
Lord, and he did

81
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:21,415
thank and praise the

82
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:24,051
Lord all the day

83
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:26,687
long; and when the

84
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:29,323
night came, they did

85
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:31,291
not cease to praise the Lord.

86
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:31,655
10 And thus they

87
00:01:31,655 --> 00:01:32,019
were driven forth;

88
00:01:32,019 --> 00:01:32,383
and no monster of

89
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:32,747
the sea could

90
00:01:32,747 --> 00:01:33,111
break them, neither

91
00:01:33,111 --> 00:01:33,475
whale that could mar

92
00:01:33,475 --> 00:01:33,839
them; and they

93
00:01:33,839 --> 00:01:34,203
did have light

94
00:01:34,203 --> 00:01:34,567
continually, whether it

95
00:01:34,567 --> 00:01:34,931
was above the

96
00:01:34,931 --> 00:01:35,696
water or under the water.

97
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,896
11 And thus they

98
00:01:37,896 --> 00:01:40,096
were driven

99
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:42,296
forth, three hundred

100
00:01:42,296 --> 00:01:44,496
and forty and four

101
00:01:44,496 --> 00:01:46,073
days upon the water.

102
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:49,223
12 And they did

103
00:01:49,223 --> 00:01:52,373
land upon the

104
00:01:52,373 --> 00:01:55,523
shore of the

105
00:01:55,523 --> 00:01:58,673
promised land. And

106
00:01:58,673 --> 00:02:01,823
when they had set

107
00:02:01,823 --> 00:02:04,973
their feet upon

108
00:02:04,973 --> 00:02:08,123
the shores of

109
00:02:08,123 --> 00:02:11,273
the promised land

110
00:02:11,273 --> 00:02:14,423
they bowed

111
00:02:14,423 --> 00:02:17,573
themselves down upon

112
00:02:17,573 --> 00:02:20,723
the face of the

113
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:23,873
land, and did

114
00:02:23,873 --> 00:02:27,023
humble themselves

115
00:02:27,023 --> 00:02:30,173
before the Lord,

116
00:02:30,173 --> 00:02:33,323
and did shed

117
00:02:33,323 --> 00:02:36,473
tears of joy

118
00:02:36,473 --> 00:02:39,623
before the Lord,

119
00:02:39,623 --> 00:02:42,773
because of the

120
00:02:42,773 --> 00:02:45,923
multitude of his

121
00:02:45,923 --> 00:02:49,403
tender mercies over them.

122
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:52,26
13 And it came

123
00:02:52,26 --> 00:02:55,117
to pass that

124
00:02:55,117 --> 00:02:57,974
they went

125
00:02:57,974 --> 00:03:00,831
forth upon the

126
00:03:00,831 --> 00:03:03,688
face of the land,

127
00:03:03,688 --> 00:03:06,545
and began to

128
00:03:06,545 --> 00:03:09,756
till the earth.

129
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
14 And Jared

130
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
had four

131
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
sons; and they

132
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
were called

133
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
Jacom, and

134
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
Gilgah, and

135
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
Mahah, and Orihah.

136
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
15 And the

137
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
brother of

138
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
Jared also

139
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
begat sons

140
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
and daughters.

141
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
16 And the

142
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
friends

143
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
of Jared

144
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
and his

145
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
brother were

146
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
in number

147
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
about

148
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
twenty and two

149
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
souls; and

150
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
they also

151
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
begat

152
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
sons and

153
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
daughters

154
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
before they

155
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
came to the

156
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
promised

157
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
land; and

158
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
therefore

159
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
they began to be many.

160
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
17 And

161
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
they were

162
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
taught to

163
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
walk

164
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
humbly before

165
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
the

166
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
Lord; and

167
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
they were

168
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
also taught

169
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
from on high.

170
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
18 And

171
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
it came

172
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
to pass

173
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
that they

174
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
began

175
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
to spread

176
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
upon

177
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
the face

178
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
of the

179
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
land, and

180
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
to

181
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
multiply and

182
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
to till

183
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
the

184
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
earth; and

185
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
they did

186
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
wax strong in the land.

187
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
19 And

188
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
the

189
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
brother of

190
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
Jared

191
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
began

192
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
to be

193
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
old, and

194
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
saw

195
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
that he

196
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
must soon

197
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
go

198
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
down to

199
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
the

200
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
grave;

201
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
wherefore he

202
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:09,756
