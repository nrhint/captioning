00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 15 Millions of the Jaredites are slain

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
in battle—Shiz and Coriantumr assemble all

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the people to mortal combat—The Spirit of the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Lord ceases to strive with them—The Jaredite

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:23:05,
nation is utterly destroyed—Only Coriantumr remains. 

6
00:23:05,0 --> 00:23:05,0
1 And it came to pass when Coriantumr had

7
00:23:05,0 --> 00:23:05,0
recovered of his wounds, he began to

8
00:23:05,0 --> 00:22:51,
remember the words which Ether had spoken unto him.

9
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
2 He saw that there had been slain by

10
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
the sword already nearly two

11
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
millions of his people, and he began to

12
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
sorrow in his heart; yea, there had been

13
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
slain two millions of mighty men, and

14
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,
also their wives and their children.

15
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
3 He began to repent of the evil

16
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
which he had done; he began to

17
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
remember the words which had been spoken

18
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
by the mouth of all the prophets,

19
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
and he saw them that they were

20
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
fulfilled thus far, every whit; and his

21
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,
soul mourned and refused to be comforted.

22
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
4 And it came to pass that he

23
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
wrote an epistle unto Shiz,

24
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
desiring him that he would

25
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
spare the people, and he would

26
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
give up the kingdom for the

27
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,
sake of the lives of the people.

28
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
5 And it came to pass that

29
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
when Shiz had received his

30
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
epistle he wrote an epistle

31
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
unto Coriantumr, that if

32
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
he would give himself up,

33
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
that he might slay him with

34
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
his own sword, that he would

35
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,
spare the lives of the people.

36
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
6 And it came to pass

37
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
that the people repented not

38
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
of their iniquity; and

39
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
the people of Coriantumr

40
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
were stirred up to anger

41
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
against the people of

42
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
Shiz; and the people of Shiz

43
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
were stirred up to anger

44
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
against the people of

45
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
Coriantumr; wherefore, the

46
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
people of Shiz did give

47
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,
battle unto the people of Coriantumr.

48
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
7 And when Coriantumr

49
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
saw that he was about to

50
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
fall he fled again

51
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,
before the people of Shiz.

52
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
8 And it came to pass

53
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
that he came to the

54
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
waters of Ripliancum,

55
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
which, by

56
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
interpretation, is large, or to

57
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
exceed all; wherefore,

58
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
when they came to these

59
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
waters they pitched

60
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
their tents; and Shiz

61
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
also pitched his tents

62
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
near unto them; and

63
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
therefore on the morrow

64
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,
they did come to battle.

65
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
9 And it came to

66
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
pass that they fought

67
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
an exceedingly sore

68
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
battle, in which

69
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
Coriantumr was wounded

70
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
again, and he fainted

71
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,
with the loss of blood.

72
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
10 And it came to

73
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
pass that the armies

74
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
of Coriantumr did

75
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
press upon the armies

76
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
of Shiz that they

77
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
beat them, that they

78
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
caused them to flee

79
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
before them; and they

80
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
did flee southward,

81
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
and did pitch their

82
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
tents in a place

83
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,
which was called Ogath.

84
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
11 And it came to

85
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
pass that the army

86
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
of Coriantumr did

87
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
pitch their tents by

88
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
the hill Ramah; and

89
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
it was that same

90
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
hill where my father

91
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
Mormon did hide up

92
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
the records unto

93
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,
the Lord, which were sacred.

94
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
12 And it came to

95
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
pass that they

96
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
did gather

97
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
together all the people

98
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
upon all the face

99
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
of the land, who

100
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
had not been

101
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,
slain, save it was Ether.

102
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
13 And it came to

103
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
pass that Ether

104
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
did behold all

105
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
the doings of the

106
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
people; and he

107
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
beheld that the

108
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
people who were for

109
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
Coriantumr were

110
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
gathered together

111
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
to the army of

112
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
Coriantumr; and the

113
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
people who were

114
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
for Shiz were

115
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
gathered together to

116
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,
the army of Shiz.

117
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
14 Wherefore,

118
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
they were for the

119
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
space of four

120
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
years gathering

121
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
together the

122
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
people, that they

123
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
might get all who

124
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
were upon the

125
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
face of the land,

126
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
and that they

127
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
might receive all

128
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
the strength

129
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
which it was

130
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,
possible that they could receive.

131
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
15 And it came

132
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
to pass that

133
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
when they were

134
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
all gathered

135
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
together, every one

136
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
to the army

137
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
which he would,

138
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
with their wives

139
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
and their

140
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
children—both men,

141
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
women and

142
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
children being armed

143
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
with weapons

144
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
of war, having

145
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
shields, and

146
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
breastplates, and

147
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
head-plates,

148
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
and being clothed

149
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
after the

150
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
manner of war—they

151
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
did march forth

152
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
one against

153
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
another to

154
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
battle; and they

155
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,
fought all that day, and conquered not.

156
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
16 And it came

157
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
to pass that

158
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
when it was

159
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
night they were

160
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
weary, and

161
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
retired to their

162
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
camps; and

163
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
after they had

164
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
retired to their

165
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
camps they

166
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
took up a

167
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
howling and a

168
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
lamentation for the

169
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
loss of the

170
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
slain of their

171
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
people; and so

172
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
great were

173
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
their cries,

174
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
their howlings and

175
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
lamentations,

176
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
that they did

177
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,
rend the air exceedingly.

178
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
17 And it

179
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
came to pass

180
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
that on the

181
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
morrow they did

182
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
go again to

183
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
battle, and

184
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
great and

185
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
terrible was that

186
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
day;

187
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
nevertheless, they

188
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
conquered not,

189
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
and when the

190
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
night came

191
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
again they did

192
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
rend the air

193
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
with their

194
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
cries, and their

195
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
howlings,

196
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
and their

197
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
mournings, for the

198
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
loss of the

199
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,
slain of their people.

200
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
18 And it

201
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
came to pass

202
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
that

203
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
Coriantumr wrote

204
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
again an

205
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
epistle unto Shiz,

206
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
desiring

207
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
that he would

208
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
not come

209
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
again to

210
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
battle, but that

211
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
he would take

212
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
the

213
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
kingdom, and spare

214
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,
the lives of the people.

215
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
19 But

216
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
behold, the

217
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
Spirit of the

218
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
Lord had

219
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
ceased

220
00:22:51,0 --> 00:22:51,0
striving with

221
