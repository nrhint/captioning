00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,4
Chapter 15 Millions of the Jaredites are slain in

2
00:00:01,4 --> 00:00:02,8
 battle—Shiz and Coriantumr assemble all the people

3
00:00:02,8 --> 00:00:04,2
 to mortal combat—The Spirit of the Lord ceases to

4
00:00:04,2 --> 00:00:05,6
 strive with them—The Jaredite nation is utterly

5
00:00:05,6 --> 00:00:07,0
 destroyed—Only Coriantumr remains.

6
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:10,642
1 And it came to pass when Coriantumr had

7
00:00:10,642 --> 00:00:13,309
 recovered of his wounds, he began to remember the words

8
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:15,976
 which Ether had spoken unto him

9
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,549
2 He saw that there had been slain by the sword

10
00:00:17,549 --> 00:00:19,149
 already nearly two millions of his people, and he

11
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:20,749
 began to sorrow in his heart; yea, there had been

12
00:00:20,749 --> 00:00:22,349
 slain two millions of mighty men, and also their

13
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:23,949
 wives and their children

14
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,257
3 He began to repent of the evil which he had

15
00:00:25,257 --> 00:00:26,59
 done; he began to remember the words which had been

16
00:00:26,59 --> 00:00:27,923
 spoken by the mouth of all the prophets, and he saw

17
00:00:27,923 --> 00:00:29,256
 them that they were fulfilled thus far, every

18
00:00:29,256 --> 00:00:30,589
 whit; and his soul mourned and refused to be

19
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:31,922
 comforted

20
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:35,899
4 And it came to pass that he wrote an epistle

21
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:39,899
 unto Shiz, desiring him that he would spare the

22
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,899
 people, and he would give up the kingdom for the sake

23
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:47,899
 of the lives of the people

24
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,448
5 And it came to pass that when Shiz had received

25
00:00:49,448 --> 00:00:51,048
 his epistle he wrote an epistle unto Coriantumr,

26
00:00:51,048 --> 00:00:52,648
 that if he would give himself up, that he might

27
00:00:52,648 --> 00:00:54,248
 slay him with his own sword, that he would spare the

28
00:00:54,248 --> 00:00:55,848
 lives of the people

29
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:56,965
6 And it came to pass that the people repented not

30
00:00:56,965 --> 00:00:58,108
 of their iniquity; and the people of Coriantumr

31
00:00:58,108 --> 00:00:59,251
 were stirred up to anger against the people of

32
00:00:59,251 --> 00:01:00,394
 Shiz; and the people of Shiz were stirred up to anger

33
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:01,537
 against the people of Coriantumr; wherefore, the

34
00:01:01,537 --> 00:01:02,68
 people of Shiz did give battle unto the people of

35
00:01:02,68 --> 00:01:03,823
 Coriantumr

36
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:11,797
7 And when Coriantumr saw that he was about to

37
00:01:11,797 --> 00:01:19,797
 fall he fled again before the people of Shiz

38
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,413
8 And it came to pass that he came to the waters

39
00:01:22,413 --> 00:01:25,08
 of Ripliancum, which, by interpretation, is large,

40
00:01:25,08 --> 00:01:27,747
 or to exceed all; wherefore, when they came to

41
00:01:27,747 --> 00:01:30,414
 these waters they pitched their tents; and Shiz also

42
00:01:30,414 --> 00:01:33,081
 pitched his tents near unto them; and therefore on

43
00:01:33,081 --> 00:01:35,748
 the morrow they did come to battle

44
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:38,363
9 And it came to pass that they fought an

45
00:01:38,363 --> 00:01:41,03
 exceedingly sore battle, in which Coriantumr was wounded

46
00:01:41,03 --> 00:01:43,697
 again, and he fainted with the loss of blood

47
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:45,27
10 And it came to pass that the armies of

48
00:01:45,27 --> 00:01:46,87
 Coriantumr did press upon the armies of Shiz that they

49
00:01:46,87 --> 00:01:48,47
 beat them, that they caused them to flee before them;

50
00:01:48,47 --> 00:01:50,07
 and they did flee southward, and did pitch their

51
00:01:50,07 --> 00:01:51,67
 tents in a place which was called Ogath

52
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:53,645
11 And it came to pass that the army of Coriantumr

53
00:01:53,645 --> 00:01:55,645
 did pitch their tents by the hill Ramah; and it

54
00:01:55,645 --> 00:01:57,645
 was that same hill where my father Mormon did hide

55
00:01:57,645 --> 00:01:59,645
 up the records unto the Lord, which were sacred

56
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:02,287
12 And it came to pass that they did gather

57
00:02:02,287 --> 00:02:04,954
 together all the people upon all the face of the land,

58
00:02:04,954 --> 00:02:07,621
 who had not been slain, save it was Ether

59
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:08,927
13 And it came to pass that Ether did behold all

60
00:02:08,927 --> 00:02:10,26
 the doings of the people; and he beheld that the

61
00:02:10,26 --> 00:02:11,593
 people who were for Coriantumr were gathered

62
00:02:11,593 --> 00:02:12,926
 together to the army of Coriantumr; and the people who

63
00:02:12,926 --> 00:02:14,259
 were for Shiz were gathered together to the army of

64
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,592
 Shiz

65
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:17,169
14 Wherefore, they were for the space of four

66
00:02:17,169 --> 00:02:18,769
 years gathering together the people, that they might

67
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:20,369
 get all who were upon the face of the land, and

68
00:02:20,369 --> 00:02:21,969
 that they might receive all the strength which it was

69
00:02:21,969 --> 00:02:23,569
 possible that they could receive

70
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:27,543
15 And it came to pass that when they were all

71
00:02:27,543 --> 00:02:31,543
 gathered together, every one to the army which he

72
00:02:31,543 --> 00:02:35,543
 would, with their wives and their children—both men,

73
00:02:35,543 --> 00:02:39,543
 women and children being armed with weapons of

74
00:02:39,543 --> 00:02:43,543
 war, having shields, and breastplates, and

75
00:02:43,543 --> 00:02:47,543
 head-plates, and being clothed after the manner of war—they

76
00:02:47,543 --> 00:02:51,543
 did march forth one against another to battle; and

77
00:02:51,543 --> 00:02:55,543
 they fought all that day, and conquered not

78
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:56,585
16 And it came to pass that when it was night they

79
00:02:56,585 --> 00:02:57,728
 were weary, and retired to their camps; and after

80
00:02:57,728 --> 00:02:58,871
 they had retired to their camps they took up a

81
00:02:58,871 --> 00:03:00,014
 howling and a lamentation for the loss of the slain

82
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:01,157
 of their people; and so great were their cries,

83
00:03:01,157 --> 00:03:02,3
 their howlings and lamentations, that they did rend

84
00:03:02,3 --> 00:03:03,443
 the air exceedingly

85
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:04,75
17 And it came to pass that on the morrow they did

86
00:03:04,75 --> 00:03:06,083
 go again to battle, and great and terrible was

87
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,416
 that day; nevertheless, they conquered not, and when

88
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:08,749
 the night came again they did rend the air with

89
00:03:08,749 --> 00:03:10,082
 their cries, and their howlings, and their

90
00:03:10,082 --> 00:03:11,415
 mournings, for the loss of the slain of their people

91
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,391
18 And it came to pass that Coriantumr wrote again

92
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:15,391
 an epistle unto Shiz, desiring that he would not

93
00:03:15,391 --> 00:03:17,391
 come again to battle, but that he would take the

94
00:03:17,391 --> 00:03:19,391
 kingdom, and spare the lives of the people

95
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,699
19 But behold, the Spirit of the Lord had ceased

96
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:22,032
 striving with them, and Satan had full power over

97
00:03:22,032 --> 00:03:23,365
 the hearts of the people; for they were given up

98
00:03:23,365 --> 00:03:24,698
 unto the hardness of their hearts, and the blindness

99
00:03:24,698 --> 00:03:26,031
 of their minds that they might be destroyed;

100
00:03:26,031 --> 00:03:27,364
 wherefore they went again to battle

101
00:03:27,34 --> 00:03:30,007
20 And it came to pass that they fought all that

102
00:03:30,007 --> 00:03:32,674
 day, and when the night came they slept upon their

103
00:03:32,674 --> 00:03:35,341
 swords

104
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:39,315
21 And on the morrow they fought even until the

105
00:03:39,315 --> 00:03:43,315
 night came

106
00:03:43,29 --> 00:03:45,957
22 And when the night came they were drunken with

107
00:03:45,957 --> 00:03:48,624
 anger, even as a man who is drunken with wine; and

108
00:03:48,624 --> 00:03:51,291
 they slept again upon their swords

109
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,264
23 And on the morrow they fought again; and when

110
00:03:53,264 --> 00:03:55,264
 the night came they had all fallen by the sword

111
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,264
 save it were fifty and two of the people of

112
00:03:57,264 --> 00:03:59,264
 Coriantumr, and sixty and nine of the people of Shiz

113
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,239
24 And it came to pass that they slept upon their

114
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:03,239
 swords that night, and on the morrow they fought

115
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,239
 again, and they contended in their might with their

116
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:07,239
 swords and with their shields, all that day

117
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:09,881
25 And when the night came there were thirty and

118
00:04:09,881 --> 00:04:12,548
 two of the people of Shiz, and twenty and seven of

119
00:04:12,548 --> 00:04:15,215
 the people of Coriantumr

120
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,855
26 And it came to pass that they ate and slept,

121
00:04:17,855 --> 00:04:20,522
 and prepared for death on the morrow. And they were

122
00:04:20,522 --> 00:04:23,189
 large and mighty men as to the strength of men

123
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:25,83
27 And it came to pass that they fought for the

124
00:04:25,83 --> 00:04:28,497
 space of three hours, and they fainted with the loss

125
00:04:28,497 --> 00:04:31,164
 of blood

126
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:32,471
28 And it came to pass that when the men of

127
00:04:32,471 --> 00:04:33,804
 Coriantumr had received sufficient strength that they

128
00:04:33,804 --> 00:04:35,137
 could walk, they were about to flee for their lives;

129
00:04:35,137 --> 00:04:36,47
 but behold, Shiz arose, and also his men, and he

130
00:04:36,47 --> 00:04:37,803
 swore in his wrath that he would slay Coriantumr

131
00:04:37,803 --> 00:04:39,136
 or he would perish by the sword

132
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,445
29 Wherefore, he did pursue them, and on the

133
00:04:40,445 --> 00:04:41,778
 morrow he did overtake them; and they fought again with

134
00:04:41,778 --> 00:04:43,111
 the sword. And it came to pass that when they had

135
00:04:43,111 --> 00:04:44,444
 all fallen by the sword, save it were Coriantumr

136
00:04:44,444 --> 00:04:45,777
 and Shiz, behold Shiz had fainted with the loss of

137
00:04:45,777 --> 00:04:47,11
 blood

138
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,754
30 And it came to pass that when Coriantumr had

139
00:04:49,754 --> 00:04:52,421
 leaned upon his sword, that he rested a little, he

140
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:55,088
 smote off the head of Shiz

141
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,061
31 And it came to pass that after he had smitten

142
00:04:57,061 --> 00:04:59,061
 off the head of Shiz, that Shiz raised up on his

143
00:04:59,061 --> 00:05:01,061
 hands and fell; and after that he had struggled for

144
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:03,061
 breath, he died

145
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:07,036
32 And it came to pass that Coriantumr fell to the

146
00:05:07,036 --> 00:05:11,036
 earth, and became as if he had no life

147
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:12,178
33 And the Lord spake unto Ether, and said unto

148
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:13,345
 him: Go forth. And he went forth, and beheld that

149
00:05:13,345 --> 00:05:14,512
 the words of the Lord had all been fulfilled; and he

150
00:05:14,512 --> 00:05:15,679
 finished his record; (and the hundredth part I

151
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:16,846
 have not written) and he hid them in a manner that

152
00:05:16,846 --> 00:05:18,013
 the people of Limhi did find them

153
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:19,785
34 Now the last words which are written by Ether

154
00:05:19,785 --> 00:05:20,585
 are these: Whether the Lord will that I be

155
00:05:20,585 --> 00:05:21,385
 translated, or that I suffer the will of the Lord in the

156
00:05:21,385 --> 00:05:22,185
 flesh, it mattereth not, if it so be that I am

157
00:05:22,185 --> 00:05:22,985
 saved in the kingdom of God. Amen.
