00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:07,6
Chapter 15 Millions of the Jaredites are slain

2
00:00:07,6 --> 00:00:15,2
in battle—Shiz and Coriantumr assemble all

3
00:00:15,2 --> 00:00:22,8
the people to mortal combat—The Spirit of the

4
00:00:22,8 --> 00:00:30,4
Lord ceases to strive with them—The Jaredite

5
00:00:30,4 --> 00:00:38,205
nation is utterly destroyed—Only Coriantumr remains. 

6
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:41,538
1 And it came to pass when Coriantumr had

7
00:00:41,538 --> 00:00:44,871
recovered of his wounds, he began to

8
00:00:44,871 --> 00:00:48,582
remember the words which Ether had spoken unto him.

9
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:48,415
2 He saw that there had been slain by

10
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:48,248
the sword already nearly two

11
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:48,081
millions of his people, and he began to

12
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:47,914
sorrow in his heart; yea, there had been

13
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:47,747
slain two millions of mighty men, and

14
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:47,648
also their wives and their children.

15
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:48,362
3 He began to repent of the evil

16
00:00:48,362 --> 00:00:49,076
which he had done; he began to

17
00:00:49,076 --> 00:00:49,79
remember the words which had been spoken

18
00:00:49,79 --> 00:00:50,504
by the mouth of all the prophets,

19
00:00:50,504 --> 00:00:51,218
and he saw them that they were

20
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:51,932
fulfilled thus far, every whit; and his

21
00:00:51,932 --> 00:00:52,052
soul mourned and refused to be comforted.

22
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:52,885
4 And it came to pass that he

23
00:00:52,885 --> 00:00:53,718
wrote an epistle unto Shiz,

24
00:00:53,718 --> 00:00:54,551
desiring him that he would

25
00:00:54,551 --> 00:00:55,384
spare the people, and he would

26
00:00:55,384 --> 00:00:56,217
give up the kingdom for the

27
00:00:56,217 --> 00:00:57,457
sake of the lives of the people.

28
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:57,707
5 And it came to pass that

29
00:00:57,707 --> 00:00:57,957
when Shiz had received his

30
00:00:57,957 --> 00:00:58,207
epistle he wrote an epistle

31
00:00:58,207 --> 00:00:58,457
unto Coriantumr, that if

32
00:00:58,457 --> 00:00:58,707
he would give himself up,

33
00:00:58,707 --> 00:00:58,957
that he might slay him with

34
00:00:58,957 --> 00:00:59,207
his own sword, that he would

35
00:00:59,207 --> 00:00:59,86
spare the lives of the people.

36
00:00:59,86 --> 00:00:59,777
6 And it came to pass

37
00:00:59,777 --> 00:00:59,694
that the people repented not

38
00:00:59,694 --> 00:00:59,611
of their iniquity; and

39
00:00:59,611 --> 00:00:59,528
the people of Coriantumr

40
00:00:59,528 --> 00:00:59,445
were stirred up to anger

41
00:00:59,445 --> 00:00:59,362
against the people of

42
00:00:59,362 --> 00:00:59,279
Shiz; and the people of Shiz

43
00:00:59,279 --> 00:00:59,196
were stirred up to anger

44
00:00:59,196 --> 00:00:59,113
against the people of

45
00:00:59,113 --> 00:00:59,03
Coriantumr; wherefore, the

46
00:00:59,03 --> 00:00:58,947
people of Shiz did give

47
00:00:58,947 --> 00:00:58,926
battle unto the people of Coriantumr.

48
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:00,676
7 And when Coriantumr

49
00:01:00,676 --> 00:01:02,426
saw that he was about to

50
00:01:02,426 --> 00:01:04,176
fall he fled again

51
00:01:04,176 --> 00:01:05,966
before the people of Shiz.

52
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:05,966
8 And it came to pass

53
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:05,966
that he came to the

54
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:05,966
waters of Ripliancum,

55
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:05,966
which, by

56
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:05,966
interpretation, is large, or to

57
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:05,966
exceed all; wherefore,

58
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:05,966
when they came to these

59
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:05,966
waters they pitched

60
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:05,966
their tents; and Shiz

61
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:05,966
also pitched his tents

62
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:05,966
near unto them; and

63
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:05,966
therefore on the morrow

64
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:05,032
they did come to battle.

65
00:01:05,032 --> 00:01:06,461
9 And it came to

66
00:01:06,461 --> 00:01:07,89
pass that they fought

67
00:01:07,89 --> 00:01:09,319
an exceedingly sore

68
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,748
battle, in which

69
00:01:10,748 --> 00:01:12,177
Coriantumr was wounded

70
00:01:12,177 --> 00:01:13,606
again, and he fainted

71
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:15,375
with the loss of blood.

72
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:15,958
10 And it came to

73
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:16,541
pass that the armies

74
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:17,124
of Coriantumr did

75
00:01:17,124 --> 00:01:17,707
press upon the armies

76
00:01:17,707 --> 00:01:18,29
of Shiz that they

77
00:01:18,29 --> 00:01:18,873
beat them, that they

78
00:01:18,873 --> 00:01:19,456
caused them to flee

79
00:01:19,456 --> 00:01:20,039
before them; and they

80
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:20,622
did flee southward,

81
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:21,205
and did pitch their

82
00:01:21,205 --> 00:01:21,788
tents in a place

83
00:01:21,788 --> 00:01:22,382
which was called Ogath.

84
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:22,582
11 And it came to

85
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:22,782
pass that the army

86
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:22,982
of Coriantumr did

87
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:23,182
pitch their tents by

88
00:01:23,182 --> 00:01:23,382
the hill Ramah; and

89
00:01:23,382 --> 00:01:23,582
it was that same

90
00:01:23,582 --> 00:01:23,782
hill where my father

91
00:01:23,782 --> 00:01:23,982
Mormon did hide up

92
00:01:23,982 --> 00:01:24,182
the records unto

93
00:01:24,182 --> 00:01:24,785
the Lord, which were sacred.

94
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:24,785
12 And it came to

95
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:24,785
pass that they

96
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:24,785
did gather

97
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:24,785
together all the people

98
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:24,785
upon all the face

99
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:24,785
of the land, who

100
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:24,785
had not been

101
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:24,318
slain, save it was Ether.

102
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:24,251
13 And it came to

103
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:24,184
pass that Ether

104
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:24,117
did behold all

105
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:24,05
the doings of the

106
00:01:24,05 --> 00:01:23,983
people; and he

107
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:23,916
beheld that the

108
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:23,849
people who were for

109
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:23,782
Coriantumr were

110
00:01:23,782 --> 00:01:23,715
gathered together

111
00:01:23,715 --> 00:01:23,648
to the army of

112
00:01:23,648 --> 00:01:23,581
Coriantumr; and the

113
00:01:23,581 --> 00:01:23,514
people who were

114
00:01:23,514 --> 00:01:23,447
for Shiz were

115
00:01:23,447 --> 00:01:23,38
gathered together to

116
00:01:23,38 --> 00:01:23,383
the army of Shiz.

117
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:23,883
14 Wherefore,

118
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:24,383
they were for the

119
00:01:24,383 --> 00:01:24,883
space of four

120
00:01:24,883 --> 00:01:25,383
years gathering

121
00:01:25,383 --> 00:01:25,883
together the

122
00:01:25,883 --> 00:01:26,383
people, that they

123
00:01:26,383 --> 00:01:26,883
might get all who

124
00:01:26,883 --> 00:01:27,383
were upon the

125
00:01:27,383 --> 00:01:27,883
face of the land,

126
00:01:27,883 --> 00:01:28,383
and that they

127
00:01:28,383 --> 00:01:28,883
might receive all

128
00:01:28,883 --> 00:01:29,383
the strength

129
00:01:29,383 --> 00:01:29,883
which it was

130
00:01:29,883 --> 00:01:30,424
possible that they could receive.

131
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:30,944
15 And it came

132
00:01:30,944 --> 00:01:31,464
to pass that

133
00:01:31,464 --> 00:01:31,984
when they were

134
00:01:31,984 --> 00:01:32,504
all gathered

135
00:01:32,504 --> 00:01:33,024
together, every one

136
00:01:33,024 --> 00:01:33,544
to the army

137
00:01:33,544 --> 00:01:34,064
which he would,

138
00:01:34,064 --> 00:01:34,584
with their wives

139
00:01:34,584 --> 00:01:35,104
and their

140
00:01:35,104 --> 00:01:35,624
children—both men,

141
00:01:35,624 --> 00:01:36,144
women and

142
00:01:36,144 --> 00:01:36,664
children being armed

143
00:01:36,664 --> 00:01:37,184
with weapons

144
00:01:37,184 --> 00:01:37,704
of war, having

145
00:01:37,704 --> 00:01:38,224
shields, and

146
00:01:38,224 --> 00:01:38,744
breastplates, and

147
00:01:38,744 --> 00:01:39,264
head-plates,

148
00:01:39,264 --> 00:01:39,784
and being clothed

149
00:01:39,784 --> 00:01:40,304
after the

150
00:01:40,304 --> 00:01:40,824
manner of war—they

151
00:01:40,824 --> 00:01:41,344
did march forth

152
00:01:41,344 --> 00:01:41,864
one against

153
00:01:41,864 --> 00:01:42,384
another to

154
00:01:42,384 --> 00:01:42,904
battle; and they

155
00:01:42,904 --> 00:01:43,77
fought all that day, and conquered not.

156
00:01:43,77 --> 00:01:44,043
16 And it came

157
00:01:44,043 --> 00:01:44,316
to pass that

158
00:01:44,316 --> 00:01:44,589
when it was

159
00:01:44,589 --> 00:01:44,862
night they were

160
00:01:44,862 --> 00:01:45,135
weary, and

161
00:01:45,135 --> 00:01:45,408
retired to their

162
00:01:45,408 --> 00:01:45,681
camps; and

163
00:01:45,681 --> 00:01:45,954
after they had

164
00:01:45,954 --> 00:01:46,227
retired to their

165
00:01:46,227 --> 00:01:46,5
camps they

166
00:01:46,5 --> 00:01:46,773
took up a

167
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:47,046
howling and a

168
00:01:47,046 --> 00:01:47,319
lamentation for the

169
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:47,592
loss of the

170
00:01:47,592 --> 00:01:47,865
slain of their

171
00:01:47,865 --> 00:01:48,138
people; and so

172
00:01:48,138 --> 00:01:48,411
great were

173
00:01:48,411 --> 00:01:48,684
their cries,

174
00:01:48,684 --> 00:01:48,957
their howlings and

175
00:01:48,957 --> 00:01:49,23
lamentations,

176
00:01:49,23 --> 00:01:49,503
that they did

177
00:01:49,503 --> 00:01:49,643
rend the air exceedingly.

178
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:50,098
17 And it

179
00:01:50,098 --> 00:01:50,553
came to pass

180
00:01:50,553 --> 00:01:51,008
that on the

181
00:01:51,008 --> 00:01:51,463
morrow they did

182
00:01:51,463 --> 00:01:51,918
go again to

183
00:01:51,918 --> 00:01:52,373
battle, and

184
00:01:52,373 --> 00:01:52,828
great and

185
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:53,283
terrible was that

186
00:01:53,283 --> 00:01:53,738
day;

187
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:54,193
nevertheless, they

188
00:01:54,193 --> 00:01:54,648
conquered not,

189
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:55,103
and when the

190
00:01:55,103 --> 00:01:55,558
night came

191
00:01:55,558 --> 00:01:56,013
again they did

192
00:01:56,013 --> 00:01:56,468
rend the air

193
00:01:56,468 --> 00:01:56,923
with their

194
00:01:56,923 --> 00:01:57,378
cries, and their

195
00:01:57,378 --> 00:01:57,833
howlings,

196
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:58,288
and their

197
00:01:58,288 --> 00:01:58,743
mournings, for the

198
00:01:58,743 --> 00:01:59,198
loss of the

199
00:01:59,198 --> 00:01:59,987
slain of their people.

200
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:00,92
18 And it

201
00:02:00,92 --> 00:02:01,853
came to pass

202
00:02:01,853 --> 00:02:02,786
that

203
00:02:02,786 --> 00:02:03,719
Coriantumr wrote

204
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,652
again an

205
00:02:04,652 --> 00:02:05,585
epistle unto Shiz,

206
00:02:05,585 --> 00:02:06,518
desiring

207
00:02:06,518 --> 00:02:07,451
that he would

208
00:02:07,451 --> 00:02:08,384
not come

209
00:02:08,384 --> 00:02:09,317
again to

210
00:02:09,317 --> 00:02:10,25
battle, but that

211
00:02:10,25 --> 00:02:11,183
he would take

212
00:02:11,183 --> 00:02:12,116
the

213
00:02:12,116 --> 00:02:13,049
kingdom, and spare

214
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:13,834
the lives of the people.

215
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:13,792
19 But

216
00:02:13,792 --> 00:02:13,75
behold, the

217
00:02:13,75 --> 00:02:13,708
Spirit of the

218
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:13,666
Lord had

219
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:13,624
ceased

220
00:02:13,624 --> 00:02:13,582
striving with

221
00:02:13,582 --> 00:02:13,54
them, and

222
00:02:13,54 --> 00:02:13,498
Satan had full

223
00:02:13,498 --> 00:02:13,456
power over

224
00:02:13,456 --> 00:02:13,414
the hearts

225
00:02:13,414 --> 00:02:13,372
of the

226
00:02:13,372 --> 00:02:13,33
people; for

227
00:02:13,33 --> 00:02:13,288
they were

228
00:02:13,288 --> 00:02:13,246
given up unto

229
00:02:13,246 --> 00:02:13,204
the hardness

230
00:02:13,204 --> 00:02:13,162
of their

231
00:02:13,162 --> 00:02:13,12
hearts, and

232
00:02:13,12 --> 00:02:13,078
the

233
00:02:13,078 --> 00:02:13,036
blindness of their

234
00:02:13,036 --> 00:02:12,994
minds that

235
00:02:12,994 --> 00:02:12,952
they might

236
00:02:12,952 --> 00:02:12,91
be

237
00:02:12,91 --> 00:02:12,868
destroyed;

238
00:02:12,868 --> 00:02:12,899
wherefore they went again to battle.

239
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:13,399
20 And it

240
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:13,899

241
00:02:13,899 --> 00:02:14,399

249
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:17,637

with anger,

262
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:19,21
even as

263
00:02:19,21 --> 00:02:19,148

264
00:02:19,148 --> 00:02:19,086
