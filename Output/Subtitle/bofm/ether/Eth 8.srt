00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 8 There is strife and contention over

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the kingdom—Akish forms an oath-bound secret

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
combination to slay the king—Secret combinations

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
are of the devil and result in the destruction

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of nations—Modern Gentiles are warned against

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the secret combination that will seek to

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:07:29,
overthrow the freedom of all lands, nations, and countries. 

8
00:07:29,0 --> 00:07:29,0
1 And it came to pass that he begat Omer,

9
00:07:29,0 --> 00:07:29,0
and Omer reigned in his stead. And Omer

10
00:07:29,0 --> 00:12:40,
begat Jared; and Jared begat sons and daughters.

11
00:12:40,0 --> 00:12:40,0
2 And Jared rebelled against his father,

12
00:12:40,0 --> 00:12:40,0
and came and dwelt in the land of Heth.

13
00:12:40,0 --> 00:12:40,0
And it came to pass that he did flatter

14
00:12:40,0 --> 00:12:40,0
many people, because of his cunning words,

15
00:12:40,0 --> 00:18:51,
until he had gained the half of the kingdom.

16
00:18:51,0 --> 00:18:51,0
3 And when he had gained the half

17
00:18:51,0 --> 00:18:51,0
of the kingdom he gave battle

18
00:18:51,0 --> 00:18:51,0
unto his father, and he did carry

19
00:18:51,0 --> 00:18:51,0
away his father into captivity,

20
00:18:51,0 --> 00:27:47,
and did make him serve in captivity;

21
00:27:47,0 --> 00:27:47,0
4 And now, in the days of the

22
00:27:47,0 --> 00:27:47,0
reign of Omer he was in

23
00:27:47,0 --> 00:27:47,0
captivity the half of his days.

24
00:27:47,0 --> 00:27:47,0
And it came to pass that he

25
00:27:47,0 --> 00:27:47,0
begat sons and daughters, among

26
00:27:47,0 --> 00:29:59,
whom were Esrom and Coriantumr;

27
00:29:59,0 --> 00:29:59,0
5 And they were

28
00:29:59,0 --> 00:29:59,0
exceedingly angry because of the

29
00:29:59,0 --> 00:29:59,0
doings of Jared their

30
00:29:59,0 --> 00:29:59,0
brother, insomuch that they did

31
00:29:59,0 --> 00:29:59,0
raise an army and gave

32
00:29:59,0 --> 00:29:59,0
battle unto Jared. And it came

33
00:29:59,0 --> 00:29:59,0
to pass that they did

34
00:29:59,0 --> 00:36:39,
give battle unto him by night.

35
00:36:39,0 --> 00:36:39,0
6 And it came to pass

36
00:36:39,0 --> 00:36:39,0
that when they had slain the

37
00:36:39,0 --> 00:36:39,0
army of Jared they were

38
00:36:39,0 --> 00:36:39,0
about to slay him also;

39
00:36:39,0 --> 00:36:39,0
and he pled with them that

40
00:36:39,0 --> 00:36:39,0
they would not slay him,

41
00:36:39,0 --> 00:36:39,0
and he would give up the

42
00:36:39,0 --> 00:36:39,0
kingdom unto his father.

43
00:36:39,0 --> 00:36:39,0
And it came to pass that

44
00:36:39,0 --> 00:38:51,
they did grant unto him his life.

45
00:38:51,0 --> 00:38:51,0
7 And now Jared became

46
00:38:51,0 --> 00:38:51,0
exceedingly sorrowful

47
00:38:51,0 --> 00:38:51,0
because of the loss

48
00:38:51,0 --> 00:38:51,0
of the kingdom, for he

49
00:38:51,0 --> 00:38:51,0
had set his heart upon

50
00:38:51,0 --> 00:38:51,0
the kingdom and upon

51
00:38:51,0 --> 00:45:46,
the glory of the world.

52
00:45:46,0 --> 00:45:46,0
8 Now the daughter of

53
00:45:46,0 --> 00:45:46,0
Jared being

54
00:45:46,0 --> 00:45:46,0
exceedingly expert, and

55
00:45:46,0 --> 00:45:46,0
seeing the sorrows of her

56
00:45:46,0 --> 00:45:46,0
father, thought to

57
00:45:46,0 --> 00:45:46,0
devise a plan whereby

58
00:45:46,0 --> 00:45:46,0
she could redeem the

59
00:45:46,0 --> 00:50:29,
kingdom unto her father.

60
00:50:29,0 --> 00:50:29,0
9 Now the daughter

61
00:50:29,0 --> 00:50:29,0
of Jared was

62
00:50:29,0 --> 00:50:29,0
exceedingly fair. And it

63
00:50:29,0 --> 00:50:29,0
came to pass that she

64
00:50:29,0 --> 00:50:29,0
did talk with her

65
00:50:29,0 --> 00:50:29,0
father, and said unto

66
00:50:29,0 --> 00:50:29,0
him: Whereby hath my

67
00:50:29,0 --> 00:50:29,0
father so much

68
00:50:29,0 --> 00:50:29,0
sorrow? Hath he not read

69
00:50:29,0 --> 00:50:29,0
the record which our

70
00:50:29,0 --> 00:50:29,0
fathers brought

71
00:50:29,0 --> 00:50:29,0
across the great deep?

72
00:50:29,0 --> 00:50:29,0
Behold, is there not

73
00:50:29,0 --> 00:50:29,0
an account

74
00:50:29,0 --> 00:50:29,0
concerning them of old, that

75
00:50:29,0 --> 00:50:29,0
they by their

76
00:50:29,0 --> 00:50:29,0
secret plans did obtain

77
00:50:29,0 --> 00:56:40,
kingdoms and great glory?

78
00:56:40,0 --> 00:56:40,0
10 And now,

79
00:56:40,0 --> 00:56:40,0
therefore, let my father

80
00:56:40,0 --> 00:56:40,0
send for Akish, the

81
00:56:40,0 --> 00:56:40,0
son of Kimnor; and

82
00:56:40,0 --> 00:56:40,0
behold, I am fair,

83
00:56:40,0 --> 00:56:40,0
and I will dance

84
00:56:40,0 --> 00:56:40,0
before him, and I

85
00:56:40,0 --> 00:56:40,0
will please him, that

86
00:56:40,0 --> 00:56:40,0
he will desire me

87
00:56:40,0 --> 00:56:40,0
to wife; wherefore

88
00:56:40,0 --> 00:56:40,0
if he shall desire

89
00:56:40,0 --> 00:56:40,0
of thee that ye

90
00:56:40,0 --> 00:56:40,0
shall give unto him me

91
00:56:40,0 --> 00:56:40,0
to wife, then shall

92
00:56:40,0 --> 00:56:40,0
ye say: I will

93
00:56:40,0 --> 00:56:40,0
give her if ye will

94
00:56:40,0 --> 00:56:40,0
bring unto me the

95
00:56:40,0 --> 00:58:52,
head of my father, the king.

96
00:58:52,0 --> 00:58:52,0
11 And now Omer

97
00:58:52,0 --> 00:58:52,0
was a friend to

98
00:58:52,0 --> 00:58:52,0
Akish; wherefore,

99
00:58:52,0 --> 00:58:52,0
when Jared had

100
00:58:52,0 --> 00:58:52,0
sent for Akish, the

101
00:58:52,0 --> 00:58:52,0
daughter of Jared

102
00:58:52,0 --> 00:58:52,0
danced before

103
00:58:52,0 --> 00:58:52,0
him that she

104
00:58:52,0 --> 00:58:52,0
pleased him, insomuch

105
00:58:52,0 --> 00:58:52,0
that he desired

106
00:58:52,0 --> 00:58:52,0
her to wife. And it

107
00:58:52,0 --> 00:58:52,0
came to pass

108
00:58:52,0 --> 00:58:52,0
that he said unto

109
00:58:52,0 --> 01:10:49,
Jared: Give her unto me to wife.

110
01:10:49,0 --> 01:10:49,0
12 And Jared

111
01:10:49,0 --> 01:10:49,0
said unto him: I

112
01:10:49,0 --> 01:10:49,0
will give her

113
01:10:49,0 --> 01:10:49,0
unto you, if ye

114
01:10:49,0 --> 01:10:49,0
will bring unto

115
01:10:49,0 --> 01:10:49,0
me the head of

116
01:10:49,0 --> 01:22:32,
my father, the king.

117
01:22:32,0 --> 01:22:32,0
13 And it came

118
01:22:32,0 --> 01:22:32,0
to pass that

119
01:22:32,0 --> 01:22:32,0
Akish gathered

120
01:22:32,0 --> 01:22:32,0
in unto the

121
01:22:32,0 --> 01:22:32,0
house of Jared

122
01:22:32,0 --> 01:22:32,0
all his

123
01:22:32,0 --> 01:22:32,0
kinsfolk, and said

124
01:22:32,0 --> 01:22:32,0
unto them: Will

125
01:22:32,0 --> 01:22:32,0
ye swear unto

126
01:22:32,0 --> 01:22:32,0
me that ye

127
01:22:32,0 --> 01:22:32,0
will be faithful

128
01:22:32,0 --> 01:22:32,0
unto me in

129
01:22:32,0 --> 01:22:32,0
the thing which

130
01:22:32,0 --> 01:35:41,
I shall desire of you?

131
01:35:41,0 --> 01:35:41,0
14 And it

132
01:35:41,0 --> 01:35:41,0
came to pass

133
01:35:41,0 --> 01:35:41,0
that they all

134
01:35:41,0 --> 01:35:41,0
sware unto him,

135
01:35:41,0 --> 01:35:41,0
by the God

136
01:35:41,0 --> 01:35:41,0
of heaven, and

137
01:35:41,0 --> 01:35:41,0
also by the

138
01:35:41,0 --> 01:35:41,0
heavens, and

139
01:35:41,0 --> 01:35:41,0
also by the

140
01:35:41,0 --> 01:35:41,0
earth, and by

141
01:35:41,0 --> 01:35:41,0
their heads,

142
01:35:41,0 --> 01:35:41,0
that whoso

143
01:35:41,0 --> 01:35:41,0
should vary

144
01:35:41,0 --> 01:35:41,0
from the

145
01:35:41,0 --> 01:35:41,0
assistance which

146
01:35:41,0 --> 01:35:41,0
Akish desired

147
01:35:41,0 --> 01:35:41,0
should lose his

148
01:35:41,0 --> 01:35:41,0
head; and

149
01:35:41,0 --> 01:35:41,0
whoso should

150
01:35:41,0 --> 01:35:41,0
divulge

151
01:35:41,0 --> 01:35:41,0
whatsoever thing

152
01:35:41,0 --> 01:35:41,0
Akish made known

153
01:35:41,0 --> 01:35:41,0
unto them,

154
01:35:41,0 --> 01:42:49,
the same should lose his life.

155
01:42:49,0 --> 01:42:49,0
15 And it

156
01:42:49,0 --> 01:42:49,0
came to pass

157
01:42:49,0 --> 01:42:49,0
that thus

158
01:42:49,0 --> 01:42:49,0
they did agree

159
01:42:49,0 --> 01:42:49,0
with Akish.

160
01:42:49,0 --> 01:42:49,0
And Akish

161
01:42:49,0 --> 01:42:49,0
did administer

162
01:42:49,0 --> 01:42:49,0
unto them

163
01:42:49,0 --> 01:42:49,0
the oaths

164
01:42:49,0 --> 01:42:49,0
which were

165
01:42:49,0 --> 01:42:49,0
given by them of

166
01:42:49,0 --> 01:42:49,0
old who

167
01:42:49,0 --> 01:42:49,0
also sought

168
01:42:49,0 --> 01:42:49,0
power, which

169
01:42:49,0 --> 01:42:49,0
had been

170
01:42:49,0 --> 01:42:49,0
handed down even

171
01:42:49,0 --> 01:42:49,0
from Cain,

172
01:42:49,0 --> 01:42:49,0
who was a

173
01:42:49,0 --> 01:46:20,
murderer from the beginning.

174
01:46:20,0 --> 01:46:20,0
16 And they

175
01:46:20,0 --> 01:46:20,0
were kept

176
01:46:20,0 --> 01:46:20,0
up by the

177
01:46:20,0 --> 01:46:20,0
power of the

178
01:46:20,0 --> 01:46:20,0
devil to

179
01:46:20,0 --> 01:46:20,0
administer

180
01:46:20,0 --> 01:46:20,0
these oaths

181
01:46:20,0 --> 01:46:20,0
unto the

182
01:46:20,0 --> 01:46:20,0
people, to

183
01:46:20,0 --> 01:46:20,0
keep them in

184
01:46:20,0 --> 01:46:20,0
darkness,

185
01:46:20,0 --> 01:46:20,0
to help such

186
01:46:20,0 --> 01:46:20,0
as sought

187
01:46:20,0 --> 01:46:20,0
power to

188
01:46:20,0 --> 01:46:20,0
gain power,

189
01:46:20,0 --> 01:46:20,0
and to

190
01:46:20,0 --> 01:46:20,0
murder, and to

191
01:46:20,0 --> 01:46:20,0
plunder, and

192
01:46:20,0 --> 01:46:20,0
to lie,

193
01:46:20,0 --> 01:46:20,0
and to commit

194
01:46:20,0 --> 01:46:20,0
all manner

195
01:46:20,0 --> 02:03:27,
of wickedness and whoredoms.

196
02:03:27,0 --> 02:03:27,0
17 And it

197
02:03:27,0 --> 02:03:27,0
was the

198
02:03:27,0 --> 02:03:27,0
daughter of

199
02:03:27,0 --> 02:03:27,0
Jared who

200
02:03:27,0 --> 02:03:27,0
put it

201
02:03:27,0 --> 02:03:27,0
into his

202
02:03:27,0 --> 02:03:27,0
heart to

203
02:03:27,0 --> 02:03:27,0
search up these

204
02:03:27,0 --> 02:03:27,0
things of

205
02:03:27,0 --> 02:03:27,0
old; and

206
02:03:27,0 --> 02:03:27,0
Jared put

207
02:03:27,0 --> 02:03:27,0
it into

208
02:03:27,0 --> 02:03:27,0
the heart of

209
02:03:27,0 --> 02:03:27,0
Akish;

210
02:03:27,0 --> 02:03:27,0
wherefore,

211
02:03:27,0 --> 02:03:27,0
Akish

212
02:03:27,0 --> 02:03:27,0
administered it

213
02:03:27,0 --> 02:03:27,0
unto his

214
02:03:27,0 --> 02:03:27,0
kindred

215
02:03:27,0 --> 02:03:27,0
and friends,

216
02:03:27,0 --> 02:03:27,0
leading

217
02:03:27,0 --> 02:03:27,0
them away

218
02:03:27,0 --> 02:03:27,0
by fair

219
02:03:27,0 --> 02:03:27,0
promises to

220
02:03:27,0 --> 02:14:07,
do whatsoever thing he desired.

221
02:14:07,0 --> 02:14:07,0
18 And it

222
02:14:07,0 --> 02:14:07,0
came to

223
