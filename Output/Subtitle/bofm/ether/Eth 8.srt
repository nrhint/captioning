1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:08,571
Chapter 8 There is strife and contention over the

2
00:00:08,571 --> 00:00:17,142
 kingdom—Akish forms an oath-bound secret

3
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:25,713
 combination to slay the king—Secret combinations are of the

4
00:00:25,713 --> 00:00:34,284
 devil and result in the destruction of

5
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:42,855
 nations—Modern Gentiles are warned against the secret

6
00:00:42,855 --> 00:00:51,426
 combination that will seek to overthrow the freedom of

7
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:59,997
 all lands, nations, and countries.

8
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:06,96
1 And it came to pass that he begat Omer, and Omer

9
00:01:06,96 --> 00:01:13,293
 reigned in his stead. And Omer begat Jared; and

10
00:01:13,293 --> 00:01:19,626
 Jared begat sons and daughters

11
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:23,779
2 And Jared rebelled against his father, and came

12
00:01:23,779 --> 00:01:28,179
 and dwelt in the land of Heth. And it came to pass

13
00:01:28,179 --> 00:01:32,579
 that he did flatter many people, because of his

14
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:36,979
 cunning words, until he had gained the half of the

15
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:41,379
 kingdom

16
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:45,835
3 And when he had gained the half of the kingdom

17
00:01:45,835 --> 00:01:50,335
 he gave battle unto his father, and he did carry

18
00:01:50,335 --> 00:01:54,835
 away his father into captivity, and did make him

19
00:01:54,835 --> 00:01:59,335
 serve in captivity

20
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:05,119
4 And now, in the days of the reign of Omer he was

21
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:11,119
 in captivity the half of his days. And it came to

22
00:02:11,119 --> 00:02:17,119
 pass that he begat sons and daughters, among whom

23
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:23,119
 were Esrom and Coriantumr

24
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:28,277
5 And they were exceedingly angry because of the

25
00:02:28,277 --> 00:02:32,877
 doings of Jared their brother, insomuch that they

26
00:02:32,877 --> 00:02:37,477
 did raise an army and gave battle unto Jared. And

27
00:02:37,477 --> 00:02:42,077
 it came to pass that they did give battle unto him

28
00:02:42,077 --> 00:02:46,677
 by night

29
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:58,299
6 And it came to pass that when they had slain the

30
00:02:58,299 --> 00:03:10,299
 army of Jared they were about to slay him also;

31
00:03:10,299 --> 00:03:22,299
 and he pled with them that they would not slay him,

32
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:34,299
 and he would give up the kingdom unto his father.

33
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:46,299
 And it came to pass that they did grant unto him

34
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:58,299
 his life

35
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:02,071
7 And now Jared became exceedingly sorrowful

36
00:04:02,071 --> 00:04:06,071
 because of the loss of the kingdom, for he had set his

37
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:10,071
 heart upon the kingdom and upon the glory of the

38
00:04:10,071 --> 00:04:14,071
 world

39
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
8 Now the daughter of Jared being exceedingly

40
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
 expert, and seeing the sorrows of her father, thought

41
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
 to devise a plan whereby she could redeem the

42
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:14,02
 kingdom unto her father

43
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:17,921
9 Now the daughter of Jared was exceedingly fair.

44
00:04:17,921 --> 00:04:21,421
 And it came to pass that she did talk with her

45
00:04:21,421 --> 00:04:24,921
 father, and said unto him: Whereby hath my father so

46
00:04:24,921 --> 00:04:28,421
 much sorrow? Hath he not read the record which our

47
00:04:28,421 --> 00:04:31,921
 fathers brought across the great deep? Behold, is

48
00:04:31,921 --> 00:04:35,421
 there not an account concerning them of old, that

49
00:04:35,421 --> 00:04:38,921
 they by their secret plans did obtain kingdoms

50
00:04:38,921 --> 00:04:42,421
 and great glory

51
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:49,111
10 And now, therefore, let my father send for

52
00:04:49,111 --> 00:04:55,54
 Akish, the son of Kimnor; and behold, I am fair, and I

53
00:04:55,54 --> 00:05:01,969
 will dance before him, and I will please him,

54
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:08,398
 that he will desire me to wife; wherefore if he shall

55
00:05:08,398 --> 00:05:14,827
 desire of thee that ye shall give unto him me to

56
00:05:14,827 --> 00:05:21,256
 wife, then shall ye say: I will give her if ye

57
00:05:21,256 --> 00:05:27,685
 will bring unto me the head of my father, the king

58
00:05:27,36 --> 00:05:32,693
11 And now Omer was a friend to Akish; wherefore,

59
00:05:32,693 --> 00:05:38,026
 when Jared had sent for Akish, the daughter of

60
00:05:38,026 --> 00:05:43,359
 Jared danced before him that she pleased him,

61
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:48,692
 insomuch that he desired her to wife. And it came to pass

62
00:05:48,692 --> 00:05:54,025
 that he said unto Jared: Give her unto me to

63
00:05:54,025 --> 00:05:59,358
 wife

64
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:03,025
12 And Jared said unto him: I will give her unto

65
00:06:03,025 --> 00:06:07,025
 you, if ye will bring unto me the head of my

66
00:06:07,025 --> 00:06:11,025
 father, the king

67
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:16,338
13 And it came to pass that Akish gathered in unto

68
00:06:16,338 --> 00:06:21,338
 the house of Jared all his kinsfolk, and said

69
00:06:21,338 --> 00:06:26,338
 unto them: Will ye swear unto me that ye will be

70
00:06:26,338 --> 00:06:31,338
 faithful unto me in the thing which I shall desire of

71
00:06:31,338 --> 00:06:36,338
 you

72
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:41,9
14 And it came to pass that they all sware unto

73
00:06:41,9 --> 00:06:47,471
 him, by the God of heaven, and also by the heavens,

74
00:06:47,471 --> 00:06:53,042
 and also by the earth, and by their heads, that

75
00:06:53,042 --> 00:06:58,613
 whoso should vary from the assistance which Akish

76
00:06:58,613 --> 00:07:04,184
 desired should lose his head; and whoso should

77
00:07:04,184 --> 00:07:09,755
 divulge whatsoever thing Akish made known unto them,

78
00:07:09,755 --> 00:07:15,326
 the same should lose his life

79
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:22,769
15 And it came to pass that thus they did agree

80
00:07:22,769 --> 00:07:29,569
 with Akish. And Akish did administer unto them the

81
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:36,369
 oaths which were given by them of old who also

82
00:07:36,369 --> 00:07:43,169
 sought power, which had been handed down even from

83
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:49,969
 Cain, who was a murderer from the beginning

84
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:56,302
16 And they were kept up by the power of the devil

85
00:07:56,302 --> 00:08:03,135
 to administer these oaths unto the people, to

86
00:08:03,135 --> 00:08:09,968
 keep them in darkness, to help such as sought power

87
00:08:09,968 --> 00:08:16,801
 to gain power, and to murder, and to plunder, and

88
00:08:16,801 --> 00:08:23,634
 to lie, and to commit all manner of wickedness and

89
00:08:23,634 --> 00:08:30,467
 whoredoms

90
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:36,009
17 And it was the daughter of Jared who put it

91
00:08:36,009 --> 00:08:41,842
 into his heart to search up these things of old; and

92
00:08:41,842 --> 00:08:47,675
 Jared put it into the heart of Akish; wherefore,

93
00:08:47,675 --> 00:08:53,508
 Akish administered it unto his kindred and friends,

94
00:08:53,508 --> 00:08:59,341
 leading them away by fair promises to do

95
00:08:59,341 --> 00:09:05,174
 whatsoever thing he desired

96
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:10,379
18 And it came to pass that they formed a secret

97
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:14,879
 combination, even as they of old; which combination

98
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:19,379
 is most abominable and wicked above all, in the

99
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:23,879
 sight of God

100
00:09:23,63 --> 00:09:29,88
19 For the Lord worketh not in secret

101
00:09:29,88 --> 00:09:36,13
 combinations, neither doth he will that man should shed blood,

102
00:09:36,13 --> 00:09:42,38
 but in all things hath forbidden it, from the

103
00:09:42,38 --> 00:09:48,63
 beginning of man

104
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:53,938
20 And now I, Moroni, do not write the manner of

105
00:09:53,938 --> 00:09:59,688
 their oaths and combinations, for it hath been made

106
00:09:59,688 --> 00:10:05,438
 known unto me that they are had among all people,

107
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:11,188
 and they are had among the Lamanites

108
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:17,078
21 And they have caused the destruction of this

109
00:10:17,078 --> 00:10:22,745
 people of whom I am now speaking, and also the

110
00:10:22,745 --> 00:10:28,412
 destruction of the people of Nephi

111
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:35,399
22 And whatsoever nation shall uphold such secret

112
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:41,97
 combinations, to get power and gain, until they

113
00:10:41,97 --> 00:10:48,541
 shall spread over the nation, behold, they shall be

114
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:55,112
 destroyed; for the Lord will not suffer that the

115
00:10:55,112 --> 00:11:01,683
 blood of his saints, which shall be shed by them,

116
00:11:01,683 --> 00:11:08,254
 shall always cry unto him from the ground for

117
00:11:08,254 --> 00:11:14,825
 vengeance upon them and yet he avenge them not

118
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:19,707
23 Wherefore, O ye Gentiles, it is wisdom in God

119
00:11:19,707 --> 00:11:25,407
 that these things should be shown unto you, that

120
00:11:25,407 --> 00:11:31,107
 thereby ye may repent of your sins, and suffer not

121
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:36,807
 that these murderous combinations shall get above

122
00:11:36,807 --> 00:11:42,507
 you, which are built up to get power and gain—and

123
00:11:42,507 --> 00:11:48,207
 the work, yea, even the work of destruction come

124
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:53,907
 upon you, yea, even the sword of the justice of the

125
00:11:53,907 --> 00:11:59,607
 Eternal God shall fall upon you, to your overthrow

126
00:11:59,607 --> 00:12:05,307
 and destruction if ye shall suffer these things

127
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:11,007
 to be

128
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:16,289
24 Wherefore, the Lord commandeth you, when ye

129
00:12:16,289 --> 00:12:21,414
 shall see these things come among you that ye shall

130
00:12:21,414 --> 00:12:26,539
 awake to a sense of your awful situation, because

131
00:12:26,539 --> 00:12:31,664
 of this secret combination which shall be among

132
00:12:31,664 --> 00:12:36,789
 you; or wo be unto it, because of the blood of them

133
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:41,914
 who have been slain; for they cry from the dust for

134
00:12:41,914 --> 00:12:47,039
 vengeance upon it, and also upon those who built

135
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:52,164
 it up

136
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:59,475
25 For it cometh to pass that whoso buildeth it up

137
00:12:59,475 --> 00:13:06,111
 seeketh to overthrow the freedom of all lands,

138
00:13:06,111 --> 00:13:12,747
 nations, and countries; and it bringeth to pass the

139
00:13:12,747 --> 00:13:19,383
 destruction of all people, for it is built up by

140
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:26,019
 the devil, who is the father of all lies; even that

141
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:32,655
 same liar who beguiled our first parents, yea,

142
00:13:32,655 --> 00:13:39,291
 even that same liar who hath caused man to commit

143
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:45,927
 murder from the beginning; who hath hardened the

144
00:13:45,927 --> 00:13:52,563
 hearts of men that they have murdered the prophets,

145
00:13:52,563 --> 00:13:59,199
 and stoned them, and cast them out from the

146
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:05,835
 beginning

147
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:07,764
26 Wherefore, I, Moroni, am commanded to write

148
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:10,05
 these things that evil may be done away, and that the

149
00:14:10,05 --> 00:14:12,336
 time may come that Satan may have no power upon

150
00:14:12,336 --> 00:14:14,622
 the hearts of the children of men, but that they

151
00:14:14,622 --> 00:14:16,908
 may be persuaded to do good continually, that they

152
00:14:16,908 --> 00:14:19,194
 may come unto the fountain of all righteousness and

153
00:14:19,194 --> 00:14:21,48
 be saved.
