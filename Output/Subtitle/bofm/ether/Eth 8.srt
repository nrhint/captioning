00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:07,714
Chapter 8 There is strife and contention over

2
00:00:07,714 --> 00:00:15,428
the kingdom—Akish forms an oath-bound secret

3
00:00:15,428 --> 00:00:23,142
combination to slay the king—Secret combinations

4
00:00:23,142 --> 00:00:30,856
are of the devil and result in the destruction

5
00:00:30,856 --> 00:00:38,57
of nations—Modern Gentiles are warned against

6
00:00:38,57 --> 00:00:46,284
the secret combination that will seek to

7
00:00:46,284 --> 00:00:54,187
overthrow the freedom of all lands, nations, and countries. 

8
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:54,187
1 And it came to pass that he begat Omer,

9
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:54,187
and Omer reigned in his stead. And Omer

10
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:54,655
begat Jared; and Jared begat sons and daughters.

11
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:55,255
2 And Jared rebelled against his father,

12
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:55,855
and came and dwelt in the land of Heth.

13
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:56,455
And it came to pass that he did flatter

14
00:00:56,455 --> 00:00:57,055
many people, because of his cunning words,

15
00:00:57,055 --> 00:00:57,057
until he had gained the half of the kingdom.

16
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:57,457
3 And when he had gained the half

17
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:57,857
of the kingdom he gave battle

18
00:00:57,857 --> 00:00:58,257
unto his father, and he did carry

19
00:00:58,257 --> 00:00:58,657
away his father into captivity,

20
00:00:58,657 --> 00:00:59,459
and did make him serve in captivity;

21
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:00,626
4 And now, in the days of the

22
00:01:00,626 --> 00:01:01,793
reign of Omer he was in

23
00:01:01,793 --> 00:01:02,96
captivity the half of his days.

24
00:01:02,96 --> 00:01:04,127
And it came to pass that he

25
00:01:04,127 --> 00:01:05,294
begat sons and daughters, among

26
00:01:05,294 --> 00:01:06,466
whom were Esrom and Coriantumr;

27
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:07,341
5 And they were

28
00:01:07,341 --> 00:01:08,216
exceedingly angry because of the

29
00:01:08,216 --> 00:01:09,091
doings of Jared their

30
00:01:09,091 --> 00:01:09,966
brother, insomuch that they did

31
00:01:09,966 --> 00:01:10,841
raise an army and gave

32
00:01:10,841 --> 00:01:11,716
battle unto Jared. And it came

33
00:01:11,716 --> 00:01:12,591
to pass that they did

34
00:01:12,591 --> 00:01:13,974
give battle unto him by night.

35
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:13,974
6 And it came to pass

36
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:13,974
that when they had slain the

37
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:13,974
army of Jared they were

38
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:13,974
about to slay him also;

39
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:13,974
and he pled with them that

40
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:13,974
they would not slay him,

41
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:13,974
and he would give up the

42
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:13,974
kingdom unto his father.

43
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:13,974
And it came to pass that

44
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:13,04
they did grant unto him his life.

45
00:01:13,04 --> 00:01:13,611
7 And now Jared became

46
00:01:13,611 --> 00:01:14,182
exceedingly sorrowful

47
00:01:14,182 --> 00:01:14,753
because of the loss

48
00:01:14,753 --> 00:01:15,324
of the kingdom, for he

49
00:01:15,324 --> 00:01:15,895
had set his heart upon

50
00:01:15,895 --> 00:01:16,466
the kingdom and upon

51
00:01:16,466 --> 00:01:17,444
the glory of the world.

52
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:19,944
8 Now the daughter of

53
00:01:19,944 --> 00:01:22,444
Jared being

54
00:01:22,444 --> 00:01:24,944
exceedingly expert, and

55
00:01:24,944 --> 00:01:27,444
seeing the sorrows of her

56
00:01:27,444 --> 00:01:29,944
father, thought to

57
00:01:29,944 --> 00:01:32,444
devise a plan whereby

58
00:01:32,444 --> 00:01:34,944
she could redeem the

59
00:01:34,944 --> 00:01:37,764
kingdom unto her father.

60
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:38,375
9 Now the daughter

61
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:38,986
of Jared was

62
00:01:38,986 --> 00:01:39,597
exceedingly fair. And it

63
00:01:39,597 --> 00:01:40,208
came to pass that she

64
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:40,819
did talk with her

65
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:41,43
father, and said unto

66
00:01:41,43 --> 00:01:42,041
him: Whereby hath my

67
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:42,652
father so much

68
00:01:42,652 --> 00:01:43,263
sorrow? Hath he not read

69
00:01:43,263 --> 00:01:43,874
the record which our

70
00:01:43,874 --> 00:01:44,485
fathers brought

71
00:01:44,485 --> 00:01:45,096
across the great deep?

72
00:01:45,096 --> 00:01:45,707
Behold, is there not

73
00:01:45,707 --> 00:01:46,318
an account

74
00:01:46,318 --> 00:01:46,929
concerning them of old, that

75
00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:47,54
they by their

76
00:01:47,54 --> 00:01:48,151
secret plans did obtain

77
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:48,108
kingdoms and great glory?

78
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:48,497
10 And now,

79
00:01:48,497 --> 00:01:48,886
therefore, let my father

80
00:01:48,886 --> 00:01:49,275
send for Akish, the

81
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:49,664
son of Kimnor; and

82
00:01:49,664 --> 00:01:50,053
behold, I am fair,

83
00:01:50,053 --> 00:01:50,442
and I will dance

84
00:01:50,442 --> 00:01:50,831
before him, and I

85
00:01:50,831 --> 00:01:51,22
will please him, that

86
00:01:51,22 --> 00:01:51,609
he will desire me

87
00:01:51,609 --> 00:01:51,998
to wife; wherefore

88
00:01:51,998 --> 00:01:52,387
if he shall desire

89
00:01:52,387 --> 00:01:52,776
of thee that ye

90
00:01:52,776 --> 00:01:53,165
shall give unto him me

91
00:01:53,165 --> 00:01:53,554
to wife, then shall

92
00:01:53,554 --> 00:01:53,943
ye say: I will

93
00:01:53,943 --> 00:01:54,332
give her if ye will

94
00:01:54,332 --> 00:01:54,721
bring unto me the

95
00:01:54,721 --> 00:01:55,615
head of my father, the king.

96
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:55,686
11 And now Omer

97
00:01:55,686 --> 00:01:55,757
was a friend to

98
00:01:55,757 --> 00:01:55,828
Akish; wherefore,

99
00:01:55,828 --> 00:01:55,9
when Jared had

100
00:01:55,9 --> 00:01:55,971
sent for Akish, the

101
00:01:55,971 --> 00:01:56,041
daughter of Jared

102
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:56,112
danced before

103
00:01:56,112 --> 00:01:56,183
him that she

104
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:56,254
pleased him, insomuch

105
00:01:56,254 --> 00:01:56,325
that he desired

106
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:56,397
her to wife. And it

107
00:01:56,397 --> 00:01:56,468
came to pass

108
00:01:56,468 --> 00:01:56,538
that he said unto

109
00:01:56,538 --> 00:01:56,083
Jared: Give her unto me to wife.

110
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:55,94
12 And Jared

111
00:01:55,94 --> 00:01:55,797
said unto him: I

112
00:01:55,797 --> 00:01:55,654
will give her

113
00:01:55,654 --> 00:01:55,511
unto you, if ye

114
00:01:55,511 --> 00:01:55,368
will bring unto

115
00:01:55,368 --> 00:01:55,225
me the head of

116
00:01:55,225 --> 00:01:55,615
my father, the king.

117
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:55,686
13 And it came

118
00:01:55,686 --> 00:01:55,757
to pass that

119
00:01:55,757 --> 00:01:55,828
Akish gathered

120
00:01:55,828 --> 00:01:55,9
in unto the

121
00:01:55,9 --> 00:01:55,971
house of Jared

122
00:01:55,971 --> 00:01:56,041
all his

123
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:56,112
kinsfolk, and said

124
00:01:56,112 --> 00:01:56,183
unto them: Will

125
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:56,254
ye swear unto

126
00:01:56,254 --> 00:01:56,325
me that ye

127
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:56,397
will be faithful

128
00:01:56,397 --> 00:01:56,468
unto me in

129
00:01:56,468 --> 00:01:56,538
the thing which

130
00:01:56,538 --> 00:01:56,083
I shall desire of you?

131
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:56,041
14 And it

132
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:55,999
came to pass

133
00:01:55,999 --> 00:01:55,957
that they all

134
00:01:55,957 --> 00:01:55,915
sware unto him,

135
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:55,873
by the God

136
00:01:55,873 --> 00:01:55,831
of heaven, and

137
00:01:55,831 --> 00:01:55,789
also by the

138
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:55,747
heavens, and

139
00:01:55,747 --> 00:01:55,705
also by the

140
00:01:55,705 --> 00:01:55,663
earth, and by

141
00:01:55,663 --> 00:01:55,621
their heads,

142
00:01:55,621 --> 00:01:55,579
that whoso

143
00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:55,537
should vary

144
00:01:55,537 --> 00:01:55,495
from the

145
00:01:55,495 --> 00:01:55,453
assistance which

146
00:01:55,453 --> 00:01:55,411
Akish desired

147
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:55,369
should lose his

148
00:01:55,369 --> 00:01:55,327
head; and

149
00:01:55,327 --> 00:01:55,285
whoso should

150
00:01:55,285 --> 00:01:55,243
divulge

151
00:01:55,243 --> 00:01:55,201
whatsoever thing

152
00:01:55,201 --> 00:01:55,159
Akish made known

153
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:55,117
unto them,

154
00:01:55,117 --> 00:01:55,615
the same should lose his life.

155
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:55,668
15 And it

156
00:01:55,668 --> 00:01:55,721
came to pass

157
00:01:55,721 --> 00:01:55,775
that thus

158
00:01:55,775 --> 00:01:55,828
they did agree

159
00:01:55,828 --> 00:01:55,88
with Akish.

160
00:01:55,88 --> 00:01:55,933
And Akish

161
00:01:55,933 --> 00:01:55,986
did administer

162
00:01:55,986 --> 00:01:56,04
unto them

163
00:01:56,04 --> 00:01:56,093
the oaths

164
00:01:56,093 --> 00:01:56,145
which were

165
00:01:56,145 --> 00:01:56,198
given by them of

166
00:01:56,198 --> 00:01:56,251
old who

167
00:01:56,251 --> 00:01:56,304
also sought

168
00:01:56,304 --> 00:01:56,358
power, which

169
00:01:56,358 --> 00:01:56,41
had been

170
00:01:56,41 --> 00:01:56,463
handed down even

171
00:01:56,463 --> 00:01:56,516
from Cain,

172
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:56,569
who was a

173
00:01:56,569 --> 00:01:56,083
murderer from the beginning.

174
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:56,038
16 And they

175
00:01:56,038 --> 00:01:55,993
were kept

176
00:01:55,993 --> 00:01:55,948
up by the

177
00:01:55,948 --> 00:01:55,903
power of the

178
00:01:55,903 --> 00:01:55,858
devil to

179
00:01:55,858 --> 00:01:55,813
administer

180
00:01:55,813 --> 00:01:55,768
these oaths

181
00:01:55,768 --> 00:01:55,723
unto the

182
00:01:55,723 --> 00:01:55,678
people, to

183
00:01:55,678 --> 00:01:55,633
keep them in

184
00:01:55,633 --> 00:01:55,588
darkness,

185
00:01:55,588 --> 00:01:55,543
to help such

186
00:01:55,543 --> 00:01:55,498
as sought

187
00:01:55,498 --> 00:01:55,453
power to

188
00:01:55,453 --> 00:01:55,408
gain power,

189
00:01:55,408 --> 00:01:55,363
and to

190
00:01:55,363 --> 00:01:55,318
murder, and to

191
00:01:55,318 --> 00:01:55,273
plunder, and

192
00:01:55,273 --> 00:01:55,228
to lie,

193
00:01:55,228 --> 00:01:55,183
and to commit

194
00:01:55,183 --> 00:01:55,138
all manner

195
00:01:55,138 --> 00:01:55,615
of wickedness and whoredoms.

196
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:55,656
17 And it

197
00:01:55,656 --> 00:01:55,695
was the

198
00:01:55,695 --> 00:01:55,736
daughter of

199
00:01:55,736 --> 00:01:55,775
Jared who

200
00:01:55,775 --> 00:01:55,816
put it

201
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:55,855
into his

202
00:01:55,855 --> 00:01:55,895
heart to

203
00:01:55,895 --> 00:01:55,935
search up these

204
00:01:55,935 --> 00:01:55,975
things of

205
00:01:55,975 --> 00:01:56,016
old; and

206
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:56,055
Jared put

207
00:01:56,055 --> 00:01:56,096
it into

208
00:01:56,096 --> 00:01:56,135
the heart of

209
00:01:56,135 --> 00:01:56,175
Akish;

210
00:01:56,175 --> 00:01:56,215
wherefore,

211
00:01:56,215 --> 00:01:56,255
Akish

212
00:01:56,255 --> 00:01:56,296
administered it

213
00:01:56,296 --> 00:01:56,335
unto his

214
00:01:56,335 --> 00:01:56,376
kindred

215
00:01:56,376 --> 00:01:56,415
and friends,

216
00:01:56,415 --> 00:01:56,456
leading

217
00:01:56,456 --> 00:01:56,495
them away

218
00:01:56,495 --> 00:01:56,535
by fair

219
00:01:56,535 --> 00:01:56,575
promises to

220
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:56,083
do whatsoever thing he desired.

221
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:56,024
18 And it

222
00:01:56,024 --> 00:01:55,965
came to

223
00:01:55,965 --> 00:01:55,906
pass that

224
00:01:55,906 --> 00:01:55,847
they

225
00:01:55,847 --> 00:01:55,788
formed a

226
00:01:55,788 --> 00:01:55,729
secret

227
00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:55,67
combination,

228
00:01:55,67 --> 00:01:55,611
even as

229
00:01:55,611 --> 00:01:55,552
they of

230
00:01:55,552 --> 00:01:55,493
old; which

231
00:01:55,493 --> 00:01:55,434


232
00:01:55,434 --> 00:01:55,375
combination is most

233
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:55,316


234
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:55,257
abominable and

235
00:01:55,257 --> 00:01:55,198
wicked

236
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:55,139
above all, in

237
00:01:55,139 --> 00:01:55,615
the sight of God;

238
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:55,668
19 For

239
00:01:55,668 --> 00:01:55,721
the Lord

240
00:01:55,721 --> 00:01:55,775
worketh

241
00:01:55,775 --> 00:01:55,828
not in

243
00:01:55,88 --> 00:01:55,933


244
00:01:55,933 --> 00:01:55,986
combinations,

245
00:01:55,986 --> 00:01:56,04
neither doth

246
00:01:56,04 --> 00:01:56,093
he will

247
00:01:56,093 --> 00:01:56,145
that

248
00:01:56,145 --> 00:01:56,198
man should

249
00:01:56,198 --> 00:01:56,251
shed

250
00:01:56,251 --> 00:01:56,304
blood, but

251
00:01:56,304 --> 00:01:56,358
in all

252
00:01:56,358 --> 00:01:56,41
things

253
00:01:56,41 --> 00:01:56,463
hath

254
00:01:56,463 --> 00:01:56,516

255
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:56,569
it, from

00:01:56,569 --> 00:01:56,083
the beginning of man.

257
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:56,041
20 And

258
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:55,999
now I,

259
00:01:55,999 --> 00:01:55,957
Moroni,

260
00:01:55,957 --> 00:01:55,915

00:01:55,537 --> 00:01:55,495
