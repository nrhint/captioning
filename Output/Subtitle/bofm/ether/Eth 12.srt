00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 12 The prophet Ether exhorts the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
people to believe in God—Moroni recounts the

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
wonders and marvels done by faith—Faith

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
enabled the brother of Jared to see Christ—The

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Lord gives men weakness that they may be

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
humble—The brother of Jared moved Mount Zerin by

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
faith—Faith, hope, and charity are essential

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:06:41,
to salvation—Moroni saw Jesus face to face. 

9
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
1 And it came to pass that the days of

10
00:06:41,0 --> 00:06:41,0
Ether were in the days of Coriantumr;

11
00:06:41,0 --> 00:39:45,
and Coriantumr was king over all the land.

12
00:39:45,0 --> 00:39:45,0
2 And Ether was a prophet of the

13
00:39:45,0 --> 00:39:45,0
Lord; wherefore Ether came forth in

14
00:39:45,0 --> 00:39:45,0
the days of Coriantumr, and began to

15
00:39:45,0 --> 00:39:45,0
prophesy unto the people, for he

16
00:39:45,0 --> 00:39:45,0
could not be restrained because of

17
00:39:45,0 --> 00:41:57,
the Spirit of the Lord which was in him.

18
00:41:57,0 --> 00:41:57,0
3 For he did cry from the

19
00:41:57,0 --> 00:41:57,0
morning, even until the going down

20
00:41:57,0 --> 00:41:57,0
of the sun, exhorting the

21
00:41:57,0 --> 00:41:57,0
people to believe in God unto

22
00:41:57,0 --> 00:41:57,0
repentance lest they should be

23
00:41:57,0 --> 00:41:57,0
destroyed, saying unto them that

24
00:41:57,0 --> 00:48:24,
by faith all things are fulfilled—

25
00:48:24,0 --> 00:48:24,0
4 Wherefore, whoso believeth

26
00:48:24,0 --> 00:48:24,0
in God might with surety

27
00:48:24,0 --> 00:48:24,0
hope for a better world, yea,

28
00:48:24,0 --> 00:48:24,0
even a place at the right

29
00:48:24,0 --> 00:48:24,0
hand of God, which hope cometh

30
00:48:24,0 --> 00:48:24,0
of faith, maketh an anchor

31
00:48:24,0 --> 00:48:24,0
to the souls of men, which

32
00:48:24,0 --> 00:48:24,0
would make them sure and

33
00:48:24,0 --> 00:48:24,0
steadfast, always abounding in

34
00:48:24,0 --> 00:47:56,
good works, being led to glorify God.

35
00:47:56,0 --> 00:47:56,0
5 And it came to pass

36
00:47:56,0 --> 00:47:56,0
that Ether did prophesy

37
00:47:56,0 --> 00:47:56,0
great and marvelous things

38
00:47:56,0 --> 00:47:56,0
unto the people, which

39
00:47:56,0 --> 00:47:56,0
they did not believe,

40
00:47:56,0 --> 00:50:08,
because they saw them not.

41
00:50:08,0 --> 00:50:08,0
6 And now, I, Moroni,

42
00:50:08,0 --> 00:50:08,0
would speak somewhat

43
00:50:08,0 --> 00:50:08,0
concerning these things; I

44
00:50:08,0 --> 00:50:08,0
would show unto the

45
00:50:08,0 --> 00:50:08,0
world that faith is

46
00:50:08,0 --> 00:50:08,0
things which are hoped for

47
00:50:08,0 --> 00:50:08,0
and not seen; wherefore,

48
00:50:08,0 --> 00:50:08,0
dispute not because ye

49
00:50:08,0 --> 00:50:08,0
see not, for ye

50
00:50:08,0 --> 00:50:08,0
receive no witness until

51
00:50:08,0 --> 01:01:02,
after the trial of your faith.

52
01:01:02,0 --> 01:01:02,0
7 For it was by faith

53
01:01:02,0 --> 01:01:02,0
that Christ showed

54
01:01:02,0 --> 01:01:02,0
himself unto our fathers,

55
01:01:02,0 --> 01:01:02,0
after he had risen

56
01:01:02,0 --> 01:01:02,0
from the dead; and he

57
01:01:02,0 --> 01:01:02,0
showed not himself unto

58
01:01:02,0 --> 01:01:02,0
them until after they

59
01:01:02,0 --> 01:01:02,0
had faith in him;

60
01:01:02,0 --> 01:01:02,0
wherefore, it must needs

61
01:01:02,0 --> 01:01:02,0
be that some had faith

62
01:01:02,0 --> 01:01:02,0
in him, for he showed

63
01:01:02,0 --> 01:02:14,
himself not unto the world.

64
01:02:14,0 --> 01:02:14,0
8 But because of the

65
01:02:14,0 --> 01:02:14,0
faith of men he has

66
01:02:14,0 --> 01:02:14,0
shown himself unto the

67
01:02:14,0 --> 01:02:14,0
world, and glorified

68
01:02:14,0 --> 01:02:14,0
the name of the

69
01:02:14,0 --> 01:02:14,0
Father, and prepared a

70
01:02:14,0 --> 01:02:14,0
way that thereby others

71
01:02:14,0 --> 01:02:14,0
might be partakers

72
01:02:14,0 --> 01:02:14,0
of the heavenly gift,

73
01:02:14,0 --> 01:02:14,0
that they might hope

74
01:02:14,0 --> 01:02:14,0
for those things

75
01:02:14,0 --> 01:03:26,
which they have not seen.

76
01:03:26,0 --> 01:03:26,0
9 Wherefore, ye

77
01:03:26,0 --> 01:03:26,0
may also have hope,

78
01:03:26,0 --> 01:03:26,0
and be partakers

79
01:03:26,0 --> 01:03:26,0
of the gift, if ye

80
01:03:26,0 --> 01:18:05,
will but have faith.

81
01:18:05,0 --> 01:18:05,0
10 Behold it was

82
01:18:05,0 --> 01:18:05,0
by faith that

83
01:18:05,0 --> 01:18:05,0
they of old were

84
01:18:05,0 --> 01:18:05,0
called after the

85
01:18:05,0 --> 01:32:44,
holy order of God.

86
01:32:44,0 --> 01:32:44,0
11 Wherefore,

87
01:32:44,0 --> 01:32:44,0
by faith was the

88
01:32:44,0 --> 01:32:44,0
law of Moses

89
01:32:44,0 --> 01:32:44,0
given. But in

90
01:32:44,0 --> 01:32:44,0
the gift of his

91
01:32:44,0 --> 01:32:44,0
Son hath God

92
01:32:44,0 --> 01:32:44,0
prepared a more

93
01:32:44,0 --> 01:32:44,0
excellent way;

94
01:32:44,0 --> 01:32:44,0
and it is by

95
01:32:44,0 --> 01:32:44,0
faith that it hath

96
01:32:44,0 --> 01:32:58,
been fulfilled.

97
01:32:58,0 --> 01:32:58,0
12 For if

98
01:32:58,0 --> 01:32:58,0
there be no faith

99
01:32:58,0 --> 01:32:58,0
among the

100
01:32:58,0 --> 01:32:58,0
children of men

101
01:32:58,0 --> 01:32:58,0
God can do no

102
01:32:58,0 --> 01:32:58,0
miracle among

103
01:32:58,0 --> 01:32:58,0
them; wherefore,

104
01:32:58,0 --> 01:32:58,0
he showed not

105
01:32:58,0 --> 01:32:58,0
himself until

106
01:32:58,0 --> 01:36:43,
after their faith.

107
01:36:43,0 --> 01:36:43,0
13 Behold, it

108
01:36:43,0 --> 01:36:43,0
was the

109
01:36:43,0 --> 01:36:43,0
faith of Alma and

110
01:36:43,0 --> 01:36:43,0
Amulek that

111
01:36:43,0 --> 01:36:43,0
caused the

112
01:36:43,0 --> 01:36:43,0
prison to

113
01:36:43,0 --> 01:37:13,
tumble to the earth.

114
01:37:13,0 --> 01:37:13,0
14 Behold,

115
01:37:13,0 --> 01:37:13,0
it was the

116
01:37:13,0 --> 01:37:13,0
faith of Nephi

117
01:37:13,0 --> 01:37:13,0
and Lehi

118
01:37:13,0 --> 01:37:13,0
that wrought

119
01:37:13,0 --> 01:37:13,0
the change

120
01:37:13,0 --> 01:37:13,0
upon the

121
01:37:13,0 --> 01:37:13,0
Lamanites, that

122
01:37:13,0 --> 01:37:13,0
they were

123
01:37:13,0 --> 01:37:13,0
baptized with

124
01:37:13,0 --> 01:37:13,0
fire and with

125
01:37:13,0 --> 01:46:23,
the Holy Ghost.

126
01:46:23,0 --> 01:46:23,0
15 Behold,

127
01:46:23,0 --> 01:46:23,0
it was the

128
01:46:23,0 --> 01:46:23,0
faith of

129
01:46:23,0 --> 01:46:23,0
Ammon and his

130
01:46:23,0 --> 01:46:23,0
brethren

131
01:46:23,0 --> 01:46:23,0
which

132
01:46:23,0 --> 01:46:23,0
wrought so great

133
01:46:23,0 --> 01:46:23,0
a miracle

134
01:46:23,0 --> 02:05:28,
among the Lamanites.

135
02:05:28,0 --> 02:05:28,0
16 Yea,

136
02:05:28,0 --> 02:05:28,0
and even all

137
02:05:28,0 --> 02:05:28,0
they who

138
02:05:28,0 --> 02:05:28,0
wrought

139
02:05:28,0 --> 02:05:28,0
miracles

140
02:05:28,0 --> 02:05:28,0
wrought them

141
02:05:28,0 --> 02:05:28,0
by faith,

142
02:05:28,0 --> 02:05:28,0
even those

143
02:05:28,0 --> 02:05:28,0
who were

144
02:05:28,0 --> 02:05:28,0
before

145
02:05:28,0 --> 02:05:28,0
Christ and

146
02:05:28,0 --> 02:05:28,0
also those

147
02:05:28,0 --> 02:09:13,
who were after.

148
02:09:13,0 --> 02:09:13,0
17 And it

149
02:09:13,0 --> 02:09:13,0
was by

150
02:09:13,0 --> 02:09:13,0
faith that

151
02:09:13,0 --> 02:09:13,0
the

152
02:09:13,0 --> 02:09:13,0
three

153
02:09:13,0 --> 02:09:13,0
disciples

154
02:09:13,0 --> 02:09:13,0
obtained a

155
02:09:13,0 --> 02:09:13,0
promise that

156
02:09:13,0 --> 02:09:13,0
they

157
02:09:13,0 --> 02:09:13,0
should not

158
02:09:13,0 --> 02:09:13,0
taste of

159
02:09:13,0 --> 02:09:13,0
death; and

160
02:09:13,0 --> 02:09:13,0
they

161
02:09:13,0 --> 02:09:13,0
obtained not

162
02:09:13,0 --> 02:09:13,0
the

163
02:09:13,0 --> 02:09:13,0
promise until

164
02:09:13,0 --> 02:22:21,
after their faith.

165
02:22:21,0 --> 02:22:21,0
18 And

166
02:22:21,0 --> 02:22:21,0
neither at

167
02:22:21,0 --> 02:22:21,0
any time

168
02:22:21,0 --> 02:22:21,0
hath any

169
02:22:21,0 --> 02:22:21,0
wrought

170
02:22:21,0 --> 02:22:21,0
miracles

171
02:22:21,0 --> 02:22:21,0
until

172
02:22:21,0 --> 02:22:21,0
after their

173
02:22:21,0 --> 02:22:21,0
faith;

174
02:22:21,0 --> 02:22:21,0
wherefore

175
02:22:21,0 --> 02:22:21,0
they first

176
02:22:21,0 --> 02:22:21,0
believed

177
02:22:21,0 --> 02:22:21,0
in the

178
02:22:21,0 --> 02:24:33,
Son of God.

179
02:24:33,0 --> 02:24:33,0
19 And

180
02:24:33,0 --> 02:24:33,0
there

181
02:24:33,0 --> 02:24:33,0
were many

182
02:24:33,0 --> 02:24:33,0
whose

183
02:24:33,0 --> 02:24:33,0
faith was

184
02:24:33,0 --> 02:24:33,0
so

185
02:24:33,0 --> 02:24:33,0
exceedingly

186
02:24:33,0 --> 02:24:33,0
strong,

187
02:24:33,0 --> 02:24:33,0
even

188
02:24:33,0 --> 02:24:33,0
before Christ

189
02:24:33,0 --> 02:24:33,0
came,

190
02:24:33,0 --> 02:24:33,0
who could

191
02:24:33,0 --> 02:24:33,0
not be

192
02:24:33,0 --> 02:24:33,0
kept

193
02:24:33,0 --> 02:24:33,0
from within

194
02:24:33,0 --> 02:24:33,0
the

195
02:24:33,0 --> 02:24:33,0
veil, but

196
02:24:33,0 --> 02:24:33,0
truly saw

197
02:24:33,0 --> 02:24:33,0
with

198
02:24:33,0 --> 02:24:33,0
their eyes

199
02:24:33,0 --> 02:24:33,0
the

200
02:24:33,0 --> 02:24:33,0
things

201
02:24:33,0 --> 02:24:33,0
which they

202
02:24:33,0 --> 02:24:33,0
had

203
02:24:33,0 --> 02:24:33,0
beheld with

204
02:24:33,0 --> 02:24:33,0
an eye of

205
02:24:33,0 --> 02:24:05,
faith, and they were glad.

206
02:24:05,0 --> 02:24:05,0
20 And

207
02:24:05,0 --> 02:24:05,0
behold,

208
02:24:05,0 --> 02:24:05,0
we have

209
02:24:05,0 --> 02:24:05,0
seen in

210
02:24:05,0 --> 02:24:05,0
this

211
02:24:05,0 --> 02:24:05,0
record that

212
02:24:05,0 --> 02:24:05,0
one of

213
02:24:05,0 --> 02:24:05,0
these was

214
02:24:05,0 --> 02:24:05,0
the

215
02:24:05,0 --> 02:24:05,0
brother of

216
02:24:05,0 --> 02:24:05,0
Jared;

217
02:24:05,0 --> 02:24:05,0
for so

218
02:24:05,0 --> 02:24:05,0
great was

219
02:24:05,0 --> 02:24:05,0
his

220
02:24:05,0 --> 02:24:05,0
faith in

221
02:24:05,0 --> 02:24:05,0
God, that

222
02:24:05,0 --> 02:24:05,0
when God

223
02:24:05,0 --> 02:24:05,0
put

224
02:24:05,0 --> 02:24:05,0
forth his

225
02:24:05,0 --> 02:24:05,0
