00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,875
Chapter 12 The prophet Ether exhorts the people to

2
00:00:01,875 --> 00:00:03,75
 believe in God—Moroni recounts the wonders and

3
00:00:03,75 --> 00:00:05,625
 marvels done by faith—Faith enabled the brother of

4
00:00:05,625 --> 00:00:07,5
 Jared to see Christ—The Lord gives men weakness

5
00:00:07,5 --> 00:00:09,375
 that they may be humble—The brother of Jared moved

6
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:11,25
 Mount Zerin by faith—Faith, hope, and charity are

7
00:00:11,25 --> 00:00:13,125
 essential to salvation—Moroni saw Jesus face to

8
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:15,0
 face.

9
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,616
1 And it came to pass that the days of Ether were

10
00:00:18,616 --> 00:00:21,283
 in the days of Coriantumr; and Coriantumr was king

11
00:00:21,283 --> 00:00:23,95
 over all the land

12
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,524
2 And Ether was a prophet of the Lord; wherefore

13
00:00:25,524 --> 00:00:27,124
 Ether came forth in the days of Coriantumr, and

14
00:00:27,124 --> 00:00:28,724
 began to prophesy unto the people, for he could not

15
00:00:28,724 --> 00:00:30,324
 be restrained because of the Spirit of the Lord

16
00:00:30,324 --> 00:00:31,924
 which was in him

17
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,499
3 For he did cry from the morning, even until the

18
00:00:33,499 --> 00:00:35,099
 going down of the sun, exhorting the people to

19
00:00:35,099 --> 00:00:36,699
 believe in God unto repentance lest they should be

20
00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:38,299
 destroyed, saying unto them that by faith all things

21
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:39,899
 are fulfilled

22
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,206
4 Wherefore, whoso believeth in God might with

23
00:00:41,206 --> 00:00:42,539
 surety hope for a better world, yea, even a place at

24
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:43,872
 the right hand of God, which hope cometh of faith,

25
00:00:43,872 --> 00:00:45,205
 maketh an anchor to the souls of men, which would

26
00:00:45,205 --> 00:00:46,538
 make them sure and steadfast, always abounding in

27
00:00:46,538 --> 00:00:47,871
 good works, being led to glorify God

28
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:50,515
5 And it came to pass that Ether did prophesy

29
00:00:50,515 --> 00:00:53,182
 great and marvelous things unto the people, which they

30
00:00:53,182 --> 00:00:55,849
 did not believe, because they saw them not

31
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,155
6 And now, I, Moroni, would speak somewhat

32
00:00:57,155 --> 00:00:58,488
 concerning these things; I would show unto the world that

33
00:00:58,488 --> 00:00:59,821
 faith is things which are hoped for and not seen;

34
00:00:59,821 --> 00:01:01,154
 wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for ye

35
00:01:01,154 --> 00:01:02,487
 receive no witness until after the trial of your

36
00:01:02,487 --> 00:01:03,82
 faith

37
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,13
7 For it was by faith that Christ showed himself

38
00:01:05,13 --> 00:01:06,463
 unto our fathers, after he had risen from the dead;

39
00:01:06,463 --> 00:01:07,796
 and he showed not himself unto them until after

40
00:01:07,796 --> 00:01:09,129
 they had faith in him; wherefore, it must needs be

41
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:10,462
 that some had faith in him, for he showed himself

42
00:01:10,462 --> 00:01:11,795
 not unto the world

43
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:14,439
8 But because of the faith of men he has shown

44
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:17,106
 himself unto the world, and glorified the name of the

45
00:01:17,106 --> 00:01:19,773
 Father, and prepared a way that thereby others

46
00:01:19,773 --> 00:01:22,44
 might be partakers of the heavenly gift, that they

47
00:01:22,44 --> 00:01:25,107
 might hope for those things which they have not

48
00:01:25,107 --> 00:01:27,774
 seen

49
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:31,721
9 Wherefore, ye may also have hope, and be

50
00:01:31,721 --> 00:01:35,721
 partakers of the gift, if ye will but have faith

51
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:51,696
10 Behold it was by faith that they of old were

52
00:01:51,696 --> 00:02:07,696
 called after the holy order of God

53
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,594
11 Wherefore, by faith was the law of Moses given.

54
00:02:09,594 --> 00:02:11,594
 But in the gift of his Son hath God prepared a

55
00:02:11,594 --> 00:02:13,594
 more excellent way; and it is by faith that it hath

56
00:02:13,594 --> 00:02:15,594
 been fulfilled

57
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:18,236
12 For if there be no faith among the children of

58
00:02:18,236 --> 00:02:20,903
 men God can do no miracle among them; wherefore,

59
00:02:20,903 --> 00:02:23,57
 he showed not himself until after their faith

60
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:27,543
13 Behold, it was the faith of Alma and Amulek

61
00:02:27,543 --> 00:02:31,543
 that caused the prison to tumble to the earth

62
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:34,185
14 Behold, it was the faith of Nephi and Lehi that

63
00:02:34,185 --> 00:02:36,852
 wrought the change upon the Lamanites, that they

64
00:02:36,852 --> 00:02:39,519
 were baptized with fire and with the Holy Ghost

65
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:42,16
15 Behold, it was the faith of Ammon and his

66
00:02:42,16 --> 00:02:44,827
 brethren which wrought so great a miracle among the

67
00:02:44,827 --> 00:02:47,494
 Lamanites

68
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:50,134
16 Yea, and even all they who wrought miracles

69
00:02:50,134 --> 00:02:52,801
 wrought them by faith, even those who were before

70
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:55,468
 Christ and also those who were after

71
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:57,442
17 And it was by faith that the three disciples

72
00:02:57,442 --> 00:02:59,442
 obtained a promise that they should not taste of

73
00:02:59,442 --> 00:03:01,442
 death; and they obtained not the promise until after

74
00:03:01,442 --> 00:03:03,442
 their faith

75
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:06,084
18 And neither at any time hath any wrought

76
00:03:06,084 --> 00:03:08,751
 miracles until after their faith; wherefore they first

77
00:03:08,751 --> 00:03:11,418
 believed in the Son of God

78
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:14,591
19 And there were many whose faith was so

79
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:17,791
 exceedingly strong, even before Christ came, who could not

80
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:20,991
 be kept from within the veil, but truly saw with

81
00:03:20,991 --> 00:03:24,191
 their eyes the things which they had beheld with

82
00:03:24,191 --> 00:03:27,391
 an eye of faith, and they were glad

83
00:03:27,34 --> 00:03:28,483
20 And behold, we have seen in this record that

84
00:03:28,483 --> 00:03:29,626
 one of these was the brother of Jared; for so great

85
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:30,769
 was his faith in God, that when God put forth his

86
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:31,912
 finger he could not hide it from the sight of the

87
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:33,055
 brother of Jared, because of his word which he had

88
00:03:33,055 --> 00:03:34,198
 spoken unto him, which word he had obtained by

89
00:03:34,198 --> 00:03:35,341
 faith

90
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:36,648
21 And after the brother of Jared had beheld the

91
00:03:36,648 --> 00:03:37,981
 finger of the Lord, because of the promise which

92
00:03:37,981 --> 00:03:39,314
 the brother of Jared had obtained by faith, the Lord

93
00:03:39,314 --> 00:03:40,647
 could not withhold anything from his sight;

94
00:03:40,647 --> 00:03:41,98
 wherefore he showed him all things, for he could no

95
00:03:41,98 --> 00:03:43,313
 longer be kept without the veil

96
00:03:43,29 --> 00:03:45,29
22 And it is by faith that my fathers have

97
00:03:45,29 --> 00:03:47,29
 obtained the promise that these things should come unto

98
00:03:47,29 --> 00:03:49,29
 their brethren through the Gentiles; therefore the

99
00:03:49,29 --> 00:03:51,29
 Lord hath commanded me, yea, even Jesus Christ

100
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:52,407
23 And I said unto him: Lord, the Gentiles will

101
00:03:52,407 --> 00:03:53,55
 mock at these things, because of our weakness in

102
00:03:53,55 --> 00:03:54,693
 writing; for Lord thou hast made us mighty in word by

103
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:55,836
 faith, but thou hast not made us mighty in

104
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:56,979
 writing; for thou hast made all this people that they

105
00:03:56,979 --> 00:03:58,122
 could speak much, because of the Holy Ghost which

106
00:03:58,122 --> 00:03:59,265
 thou hast given them

107
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,382
24 And thou hast made us that we could write but

108
00:04:00,382 --> 00:04:01,525
 little, because of the awkwardness of our hands.

109
00:04:01,525 --> 00:04:02,668
 Behold, thou hast not made us mighty in writing like

110
00:04:02,668 --> 00:04:03,811
 unto the brother of Jared, for thou madest him

111
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:04,954
 that the things which he wrote were mighty even as

112
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:06,097
 thou art, unto the overpowering of man to read

113
00:04:06,097 --> 00:04:07,24
 them

114
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:08,814
25 Thou hast also made our words powerful and

115
00:04:08,814 --> 00:04:10,414
 great, even that we cannot write them; wherefore, when

116
00:04:10,414 --> 00:04:12,014
 we write we behold our weakness, and stumble

117
00:04:12,014 --> 00:04:13,614
 because of the placing of our words; and I fear lest

118
00:04:13,614 --> 00:04:15,214
 the Gentiles shall mock at our words

119
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,188
26 And when I had said this, the Lord spake unto

120
00:04:17,188 --> 00:04:19,188
 me, saying: Fools mock, but they shall mourn; and

121
00:04:19,188 --> 00:04:21,188
 my grace is sufficient for the meek, that they

122
00:04:21,188 --> 00:04:23,188
 shall take no advantage of your weakness

123
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:25,449
27 And if men come unto me I will show unto them

124
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:27,735
 their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they

125
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:30,021
 may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all

126
00:04:30,021 --> 00:04:32,307
 men that humble themselves before me; for if they

127
00:04:32,307 --> 00:04:34,593
 humble themselves before me, and have faith in me,

128
00:04:34,593 --> 00:04:36,879
 then will I make weak things become strong unto

129
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:39,165
 them

130
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,112
28 Behold, I will show unto the Gentiles their

131
00:04:41,112 --> 00:04:43,112
 weakness, and I will show unto them that faith, hope

132
00:04:43,112 --> 00:04:45,112
 and charity bringeth unto me—the fountain of all

133
00:04:45,112 --> 00:04:47,112
 righteousness

134
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,087
29 And I, Moroni, having heard these words, was

135
00:04:49,087 --> 00:04:51,087
 comforted, and said: O Lord, thy righteous will be

136
00:04:51,087 --> 00:04:53,087
 done, for I know that thou workest unto the

137
00:04:53,087 --> 00:04:55,087
 children of men according to their faith

138
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,061
30 For the brother of Jared said unto the mountain

139
00:04:57,061 --> 00:04:59,061
 Zerin, Remove—and it was removed. And if he had

140
00:04:59,061 --> 00:05:01,061
 not had faith it would not have moved; wherefore

141
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:03,061
 thou workest after men have faith

142
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,036
31 For thus didst thou manifest thyself unto thy

143
00:05:05,036 --> 00:05:07,036
 disciples; for after they had faith, and did speak

144
00:05:07,036 --> 00:05:09,036
 in thy name, thou didst show thyself unto them in

145
00:05:09,036 --> 00:05:11,036
 great power

146
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:12,178
32 And I also remember that thou hast said that

147
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:13,345
 thou hast prepared a house for man, yea, even among

148
00:05:13,345 --> 00:05:14,512
 the mansions of thy Father, in which man might

149
00:05:14,512 --> 00:05:15,679
 have a more excellent hope; wherefore man must hope,

150
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:16,846
 or he cannot receive an inheritance in the place

151
00:05:16,846 --> 00:05:18,013
 which thou hast prepared

152
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,185
33 And again, I remember that thou hast said that

153
00:05:22,185 --> 00:05:25,385
 thou hast loved the world, even unto the laying

154
00:05:25,385 --> 00:05:28,585
 down of thy life for the world, that thou mightest

155
00:05:28,585 --> 00:05:31,785
 take it again to prepare a place for the children

156
00:05:31,785 --> 00:05:34,985
 of men

157
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:36,535
34 And now I know that this love which thou hast

158
00:05:36,535 --> 00:05:38,135
 had for the children of men is charity; wherefore,

159
00:05:38,135 --> 00:05:39,735
 except men shall have charity they cannot inherit

160
00:05:39,735 --> 00:05:41,335
 that place which thou hast prepared in the

161
00:05:41,335 --> 00:05:42,935
 mansions of thy Father

162
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,242
35 Wherefore, I know by this thing which thou hast

163
00:05:44,242 --> 00:05:45,575
 said, that if the Gentiles have not charity,

164
00:05:45,575 --> 00:05:46,908
 because of our weakness, that thou wilt prove them,

165
00:05:46,908 --> 00:05:48,241
 and take away their talent, yea, even that which

166
00:05:48,241 --> 00:05:49,574
 they have received, and give unto them who shall have

167
00:05:49,574 --> 00:05:50,907
 more abundantly

168
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:53,551
36 And it came to pass that I prayed unto the Lord

169
00:05:53,551 --> 00:05:56,218
 that he would give unto the Gentiles grace, that

170
00:05:56,218 --> 00:05:58,885
 they might have charity

171
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,001
37 And it came to pass that the Lord said unto me:

172
00:06:00,001 --> 00:06:01,144
 If they have not charity it mattereth not unto

173
00:06:01,144 --> 00:06:02,287
 thee, thou hast been faithful; wherefore, thy

174
00:06:02,287 --> 00:06:03,43
 garments shall be made clean. And because thou hast seen

175
00:06:03,43 --> 00:06:04,573
 thy weakness thou shalt be made strong, even unto

176
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:05,716
 the sitting down in the place which I have

177
00:06:05,716 --> 00:06:06,859
 prepared in the mansions of my Father

178
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,433
38 And now I, Moroni, bid farewell unto the

179
00:06:08,433 --> 00:06:10,033
 Gentiles, yea, and also unto my brethren whom I love,

180
00:06:10,033 --> 00:06:11,633
 until we shall meet before the judgment-seat of

181
00:06:11,633 --> 00:06:13,233
 Christ, where all men shall know that my garments are

182
00:06:13,233 --> 00:06:14,833
 not spotted with your blood

183
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:16,408
39 And then shall ye know that I have seen Jesus,

184
00:06:16,408 --> 00:06:18,008
 and that he hath talked with me face to face, and

185
00:06:18,008 --> 00:06:19,608
 that he told me in plain humility, even as a man

186
00:06:19,608 --> 00:06:21,208
 telleth another in mine own language, concerning

187
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:22,808
 these things

188
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:26,782
40 And only a few have I written, because of my

189
00:06:26,782 --> 00:06:30,782
 weakness in writing

190
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:30,924
41 And now, I would commend you to seek this Jesus

191
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:31,091
 of whom the prophets and apostles have written,

192
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:31,258
 that the grace of God the Father, and also the Lord

193
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:31,425
 Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost, which beareth

194
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:31,592
 record of them, may be and abide in you forever.

195
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:31,759
 Amen.
