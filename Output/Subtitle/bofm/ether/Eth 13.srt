1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:08,4
Chapter 13 Ether speaks of a New Jerusalem

2
00:00:08,4 --> 00:00:16,8
to be built in America by the seed of

3
00:00:16,8 --> 00:00:25,2
Joseph—He prophesies, is cast out, writes the

4
00:00:25,2 --> 00:00:33,6
Jaredite history, and foretells the destruction

5
00:00:33,6 --> 00:00:42,242
of the Jaredites—War rages over all the land. 

6
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:41,909
1 And now I, Moroni, proceed to finish

7
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:41,576
my record concerning the destruction of

8
00:00:41,576 --> 00:00:41,308
the people of whom I have been writing.

9
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:41,208
2 For behold, they rejected all the

10
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:41,108
words of Ether; for he truly told

11
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:41,008
them of all things, from the

12
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:40,908
beginning of man; and that after the

13
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:40,808
waters had receded from off the face of

14
00:00:40,808 --> 00:00:40,708
this land it became a choice land

15
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:40,608
above all other lands, a chosen

16
00:00:40,608 --> 00:00:40,508
land of the Lord; wherefore the Lord

17
00:00:40,508 --> 00:00:40,408
would have that all men should serve

18
00:00:40,408 --> 00:00:40,374
him who dwell upon the face thereof;

19
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:41,374
3 And that it was the place of

20
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:42,374
the New Jerusalem, which

21
00:00:42,374 --> 00:00:43,374
should come down out of heaven,

22
00:00:43,374 --> 00:00:44,778
and the holy sanctuary of the Lord.

23
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:47,028
4 Behold, Ether saw the

24
00:00:47,028 --> 00:00:49,278
days of Christ, and he

25
00:00:49,278 --> 00:00:51,528
spake concerning a New

26
00:00:51,528 --> 00:00:53,22
Jerusalem upon this land.

27
00:00:53,22 --> 00:00:53,632
5 And he spake also

28
00:00:53,632 --> 00:00:54,044
concerning the house of

29
00:00:54,044 --> 00:00:54,456
Israel, and the

30
00:00:54,456 --> 00:00:54,868
Jerusalem from whence Lehi

31
00:00:54,868 --> 00:00:55,28
should come—after it

32
00:00:55,28 --> 00:00:55,692
should be destroyed it

33
00:00:55,692 --> 00:00:56,104
should be built up

34
00:00:56,104 --> 00:00:56,516
again, a holy city unto

35
00:00:56,516 --> 00:00:56,928
the Lord; wherefore, it

36
00:00:56,928 --> 00:00:57,34
could not be a new

37
00:00:57,34 --> 00:00:57,752
Jerusalem for it had been

38
00:00:57,752 --> 00:00:58,164
in a time of old; but

39
00:00:58,164 --> 00:00:58,576
it should be built up

40
00:00:58,576 --> 00:00:58,988
again, and become a

41
00:00:58,988 --> 00:00:59,4
holy city of the Lord;

42
00:00:59,4 --> 00:00:59,812
and it should be built

43
00:00:59,812 --> 00:01:00,26
unto the house of Israel—

44
00:01:00,26 --> 00:01:00,974
6 And that a New

45
00:01:00,974 --> 00:01:01,688
Jerusalem should be

46
00:01:01,688 --> 00:01:02,402
built up upon this

47
00:01:02,402 --> 00:01:03,116
land, unto the remnant

48
00:01:03,116 --> 00:01:03,83
of the seed of

49
00:01:03,83 --> 00:01:04,544
Joseph, for which things

50
00:01:04,544 --> 00:01:05,666
there has been a type.

51
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:06,313
7 For as Joseph

52
00:01:06,313 --> 00:01:06,96
brought his father

53
00:01:06,96 --> 00:01:07,607
down into the land of

54
00:01:07,607 --> 00:01:08,254
Egypt, even so he

55
00:01:08,254 --> 00:01:08,901
died there;

56
00:01:08,901 --> 00:01:09,548
wherefore, the Lord brought

57
00:01:09,548 --> 00:01:10,195
a remnant of the

58
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:10,842
seed of Joseph out

59
00:01:10,842 --> 00:01:11,489
of the land of

60
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:12,136
Jerusalem, that he might

61
00:01:12,136 --> 00:01:12,783
be merciful unto

62
00:01:12,783 --> 00:01:13,43
the seed of Joseph

63
00:01:13,43 --> 00:01:14,077
that they should

64
00:01:14,077 --> 00:01:14,724
perish not, even as he

65
00:01:14,724 --> 00:01:15,371
was merciful unto

66
00:01:15,371 --> 00:01:16,018
the father of

67
00:01:16,018 --> 00:01:16,643
Joseph that he should perish not.

68
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:17,455
8 Wherefore, the

69
00:01:17,455 --> 00:01:18,267
remnant of the

70
00:01:18,267 --> 00:01:19,079
house of Joseph shall

71
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:19,891
be built upon this

72
00:01:19,891 --> 00:01:20,703
land; and it

73
00:01:20,703 --> 00:01:21,515
shall be a land of

74
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:22,327
their inheritance;

75
00:01:22,327 --> 00:01:23,139
and they shall build

76
00:01:23,139 --> 00:01:23,951
up a holy city

77
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:24,763
unto the Lord, like

78
00:01:24,763 --> 00:01:25,575
unto the Jerusalem

79
00:01:25,575 --> 00:01:26,387
of old; and they

80
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:27,199
shall no more be

81
00:01:27,199 --> 00:01:28,011
confounded, until

82
00:01:28,011 --> 00:01:28,823
the end come when

83
00:01:28,823 --> 00:01:29,022
the earth shall pass away.

84
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:29,8
9 And there

85
00:01:29,8 --> 00:01:30,578
shall be a new

86
00:01:30,578 --> 00:01:31,356
heaven and a new

87
00:01:31,356 --> 00:01:32,134
earth; and they

88
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:32,912
shall be like unto

89
00:01:32,912 --> 00:01:33,69
the old save the

90
00:01:33,69 --> 00:01:34,468
old have passed

91
00:01:34,468 --> 00:01:35,246
away, and all

92
00:01:35,246 --> 00:01:36,063
things have become new.

93
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:36,651
10 And then

94
00:01:36,651 --> 00:01:37,239
cometh the New

95
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:37,827
Jerusalem; and

96
00:01:37,827 --> 00:01:38,415
blessed are they

97
00:01:38,415 --> 00:01:39,003
who dwell

98
00:01:39,003 --> 00:01:39,591
therein, for it is

99
00:01:39,591 --> 00:01:40,179
they whose

100
00:01:40,179 --> 00:01:40,767
garments are white

101
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:41,355
through the blood

102
00:01:41,355 --> 00:01:41,943
of the Lamb;

103
00:01:41,943 --> 00:01:42,531
and they are

104
00:01:42,531 --> 00:01:43,119
they who are

105
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:43,707
numbered among the

106
00:01:43,707 --> 00:01:44,295
remnant of the

107
00:01:44,295 --> 00:01:44,883
seed of Joseph,

108
00:01:44,883 --> 00:01:45,471
who were of the

109
00:01:45,471 --> 00:01:46,44
house of Israel.

110
00:01:46,44 --> 00:01:46,523
11 And then

111
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:46,606
also cometh the

112
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:46,689
Jerusalem of

113
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:46,772
old; and the

114
00:01:46,772 --> 00:01:46,855
inhabitants

115
00:01:46,855 --> 00:01:46,938
thereof, blessed

116
00:01:46,938 --> 00:01:47,021
are they, for

117
00:01:47,021 --> 00:01:47,104
they have been

118
00:01:47,104 --> 00:01:47,187
washed in the

119
00:01:47,187 --> 00:01:47,27
blood of the

120
00:01:47,27 --> 00:01:47,353
Lamb; and they

121
00:01:47,353 --> 00:01:47,436
are they who

122
00:01:47,436 --> 00:01:47,519
were scattered

123
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:47,602
and gathered

124
00:01:47,602 --> 00:01:47,685
in from the

125
00:01:47,685 --> 00:01:47,768
four quarters of

126
00:01:47,768 --> 00:01:47,851
the earth, and

127
00:01:47,851 --> 00:01:47,934
from the

128
00:01:47,934 --> 00:01:48,017
north countries,

129
00:01:48,017 --> 00:01:48,1
and are

130
00:01:48,1 --> 00:01:48,183
partakers of the

131
00:01:48,183 --> 00:01:48,266
fulfilling of the

132
00:01:48,266 --> 00:01:48,349
covenant which

133
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:48,842
God made with their father, Abraham.

134
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:50,227
12 And when

135
00:01:50,227 --> 00:01:51,612
these things

136
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:52,997
come, bringeth

137
00:01:52,997 --> 00:01:54,382
to pass the

138
00:01:54,382 --> 00:01:55,767
scripture

139
00:01:55,767 --> 00:01:57,152
which saith,

140
00:01:57,152 --> 00:01:58,537
there are they

141
00:01:58,537 --> 00:01:59,922
who were

142
00:01:59,922 --> 00:02:01,307
first, who shall

143
00:02:01,307 --> 00:02:02,692
be last; and

144
00:02:02,692 --> 00:02:04,077
there are they

145
00:02:04,077 --> 00:02:05,462
who were

146
00:02:05,462 --> 00:02:06,226
last, who shall be first.

147
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:06,617
13 And I was

148
00:02:06,617 --> 00:02:07,008
about to

149
00:02:07,008 --> 00:02:07,399
write more,

150
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:07,79
but I am

151
00:02:07,79 --> 00:02:08,181
forbidden; but

152
00:02:08,181 --> 00:02:08,572
great and

153
00:02:08,572 --> 00:02:08,963
marvelous were

154
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:09,354
the

155
00:02:09,354 --> 00:02:09,745
prophecies of Ether;

156
00:02:09,745 --> 00:02:10,136
but they

157
00:02:10,136 --> 00:02:10,527
esteemed him as

158
00:02:10,527 --> 00:02:10,918
naught, and

159
00:02:10,918 --> 00:02:11,309
cast him

160
00:02:11,309 --> 00:02:11,7
out; and he

161
00:02:11,7 --> 00:02:12,091
hid himself in

162
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:12,482
the cavity

163
00:02:12,482 --> 00:02:12,873
of a rock by

164
00:02:12,873 --> 00:02:13,264
day, and by

165
00:02:13,264 --> 00:02:13,655
night he

166
00:02:13,655 --> 00:02:14,046
went forth

167
00:02:14,046 --> 00:02:14,437
viewing the

168
00:02:14,437 --> 00:02:14,828
things which

169
00:02:14,828 --> 00:02:15,669
should come upon the people.

170
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:16,086
14 And as

171
00:02:16,086 --> 00:02:16,503
he dwelt in

172
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:16,92
the cavity

173
00:02:16,92 --> 00:02:17,337
of a rock

174
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:17,754
he made the

175
00:02:17,754 --> 00:02:18,171
remainder

176
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:18,588
of this

177
00:02:18,588 --> 00:02:19,005
record, viewing

178
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:19,422
the

179
00:02:19,422 --> 00:02:19,839
destructions

180
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:20,256
which came upon

181
00:02:20,256 --> 00:02:20,073
the people, by night.

182
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:20,258
15 And it

183
00:02:20,258 --> 00:02:20,443
came to

184
00:02:20,443 --> 00:02:20,628
pass that in

185
00:02:20,628 --> 00:02:20,813
that same

186
00:02:20,813 --> 00:02:20,998
year in

187
00:02:20,998 --> 00:02:21,183
which he

188
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:21,368
was cast out

189
00:02:21,368 --> 00:02:21,553
from

190
00:02:21,553 --> 00:02:21,738
among the

191
00:02:21,738 --> 00:02:21,923
people there

192
00:02:21,923 --> 00:02:22,108
began to be

193
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:22,293
a great

194
00:02:22,293 --> 00:02:22,478
war among

195
00:02:22,478 --> 00:02:22,663
the people,

196
00:02:22,663 --> 00:02:22,848
for there

197
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,033
were many

198
00:02:23,033 --> 00:02:23,218
who rose

199
00:02:23,218 --> 00:02:23,403
up, who

200
00:02:23,403 --> 00:02:23,588
were mighty

201
00:02:23,588 --> 00:02:23,773
men, and

202
00:02:23,773 --> 00:02:23,958
sought to

203
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:24,143
