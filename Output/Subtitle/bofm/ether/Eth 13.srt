00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 13 Ether speaks of a New Jerusalem

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
to be built in America by the seed of

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Joseph—He prophesies, is cast out, writes the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Jaredite history, and foretells the destruction

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:21:07,
of the Jaredites—War rages over all the land. 

6
00:21:07,0 --> 00:21:07,0
1 And now I, Moroni, proceed to finish

7
00:21:07,0 --> 00:21:07,0
my record concerning the destruction of

8
00:21:07,0 --> 00:22:19,
the people of whom I have been writing.

9
00:22:19,0 --> 00:22:19,0
2 For behold, they rejected all the

10
00:22:19,0 --> 00:22:19,0
words of Ether; for he truly told

11
00:22:19,0 --> 00:22:19,0
them of all things, from the

12
00:22:19,0 --> 00:22:19,0
beginning of man; and that after the

13
00:22:19,0 --> 00:22:19,0
waters had receded from off the face of

14
00:22:19,0 --> 00:22:19,0
this land it became a choice land

15
00:22:19,0 --> 00:22:19,0
above all other lands, a chosen

16
00:22:19,0 --> 00:22:19,0
land of the Lord; wherefore the Lord

17
00:22:19,0 --> 00:22:19,0
would have that all men should serve

18
00:22:19,0 --> 00:27:29,
him who dwell upon the face thereof;

19
00:27:29,0 --> 00:27:29,0
3 And that it was the place of

20
00:27:29,0 --> 00:27:29,0
the New Jerusalem, which

21
00:27:29,0 --> 00:27:29,0
should come down out of heaven,

22
00:27:29,0 --> 00:30:11,
and the holy sanctuary of the Lord.

23
00:30:11,0 --> 00:30:11,0
4 Behold, Ether saw the

24
00:30:11,0 --> 00:30:11,0
days of Christ, and he

25
00:30:11,0 --> 00:30:11,0
spake concerning a New

26
00:30:11,0 --> 00:44:49,
Jerusalem upon this land.

27
00:44:49,0 --> 00:44:49,0
5 And he spake also

28
00:44:49,0 --> 00:44:49,0
concerning the house of

29
00:44:49,0 --> 00:44:49,0
Israel, and the

30
00:44:49,0 --> 00:44:49,0
Jerusalem from whence Lehi

31
00:44:49,0 --> 00:44:49,0
should come—after it

32
00:44:49,0 --> 00:44:49,0
should be destroyed it

33
00:44:49,0 --> 00:44:49,0
should be built up

34
00:44:49,0 --> 00:44:49,0
again, a holy city unto

35
00:44:49,0 --> 00:44:49,0
the Lord; wherefore, it

36
00:44:49,0 --> 00:44:49,0
could not be a new

37
00:44:49,0 --> 00:44:49,0
Jerusalem for it had been

38
00:44:49,0 --> 00:44:49,0
in a time of old; but

39
00:44:49,0 --> 00:44:49,0
it should be built up

40
00:44:49,0 --> 00:44:49,0
again, and become a

41
00:44:49,0 --> 00:44:49,0
holy city of the Lord;

42
00:44:49,0 --> 00:44:49,0
and it should be built

43
00:44:49,0 --> 00:53:58,
unto the house of Israel—

44
00:53:58,0 --> 00:53:58,0
6 And that a New

45
00:53:58,0 --> 00:53:58,0
Jerusalem should be

46
00:53:58,0 --> 00:53:58,0
built up upon this

47
00:53:58,0 --> 00:53:58,0
land, unto the remnant

48
00:53:58,0 --> 00:53:58,0
of the seed of

49
00:53:58,0 --> 00:53:58,0
Joseph, for which things

50
00:53:58,0 --> 00:56:40,
there has been a type.

51
00:56:40,0 --> 00:56:40,0
7 For as Joseph

52
00:56:40,0 --> 00:56:40,0
brought his father

53
00:56:40,0 --> 00:56:40,0
down into the land of

54
00:56:40,0 --> 00:56:40,0
Egypt, even so he

55
00:56:40,0 --> 00:56:40,0
died there;

56
00:56:40,0 --> 00:56:40,0
wherefore, the Lord brought

57
00:56:40,0 --> 00:56:40,0
a remnant of the

58
00:56:40,0 --> 00:56:40,0
seed of Joseph out

59
00:56:40,0 --> 00:56:40,0
of the land of

60
00:56:40,0 --> 00:56:40,0
Jerusalem, that he might

61
00:56:40,0 --> 00:56:40,0
be merciful unto

62
00:56:40,0 --> 00:56:40,0
the seed of Joseph

63
00:56:40,0 --> 00:56:40,0
that they should

64
00:56:40,0 --> 00:56:40,0
perish not, even as he

65
00:56:40,0 --> 00:56:40,0
was merciful unto

66
00:56:40,0 --> 00:56:40,0
the father of

67
00:56:40,0 --> 01:02:51,
Joseph that he should perish not.

68
01:02:51,0 --> 01:02:51,0
8 Wherefore, the

69
01:02:51,0 --> 01:02:51,0
remnant of the

70
01:02:51,0 --> 01:02:51,0
house of Joseph shall

71
01:02:51,0 --> 01:02:51,0
be built upon this

72
01:02:51,0 --> 01:02:51,0
land; and it

73
01:02:51,0 --> 01:02:51,0
shall be a land of

74
01:02:51,0 --> 01:02:51,0
their inheritance;

75
01:02:51,0 --> 01:02:51,0
and they shall build

76
01:02:51,0 --> 01:02:51,0
up a holy city

77
01:02:51,0 --> 01:02:51,0
unto the Lord, like

78
01:02:51,0 --> 01:02:51,0
unto the Jerusalem

79
01:02:51,0 --> 01:02:51,0
of old; and they

80
01:02:51,0 --> 01:02:51,0
shall no more be

81
01:02:51,0 --> 01:02:51,0
confounded, until

82
01:02:51,0 --> 01:02:51,0
the end come when

83
01:02:51,0 --> 01:05:03,
the earth shall pass away.

84
01:05:03,0 --> 01:05:03,0
9 And there

85
01:05:03,0 --> 01:05:03,0
shall be a new

86
01:05:03,0 --> 01:05:03,0
heaven and a new

87
01:05:03,0 --> 01:05:03,0
earth; and they

88
01:05:03,0 --> 01:05:03,0
shall be like unto

89
01:05:03,0 --> 01:05:03,0
the old save the

90
01:05:03,0 --> 01:05:03,0
old have passed

91
01:05:03,0 --> 01:05:03,0
away, and all

92
01:05:03,0 --> 01:08:48,
things have become new.

93
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
10 And then

94
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
cometh the New

95
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
Jerusalem; and

96
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
blessed are they

97
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
who dwell

98
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
therein, for it is

99
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
they whose

100
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
garments are white

101
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
through the blood

102
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
of the Lamb;

103
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
and they are

104
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
they who are

105
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
numbered among the

106
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
remnant of the

107
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
seed of Joseph,

108
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
who were of the

109
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,
house of Israel.

110
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
11 And then

111
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
also cometh the

112
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
Jerusalem of

113
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
old; and the

114
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
inhabitants

115
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
thereof, blessed

116
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
are they, for

117
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
they have been

118
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
washed in the

119
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
blood of the

120
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
Lamb; and they

121
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
are they who

122
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
were scattered

123
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
and gathered

124
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
in from the

125
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
four quarters of

126
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
the earth, and

127
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
from the

128
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
north countries,

129
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
and are

130
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
partakers of the

131
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
fulfilling of the

132
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
covenant which

133
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,
God made with their father, Abraham.

134
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
12 And when

135
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
these things

136
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
come, bringeth

137
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
to pass the

138
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
scripture

139
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
which saith,

140
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
there are they

141
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
who were

142
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
first, who shall

143
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
be last; and

144
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
there are they

145
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
who were

146
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,
last, who shall be first.

147
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
13 And I was

148
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
about to

149
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
write more,

150
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
but I am

151
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
forbidden; but

152
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
great and

153
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
marvelous were

154
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
the

155
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
prophecies of Ether;

156
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
but they

157
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
esteemed him as

158
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
naught, and

159
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
cast him

160
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
out; and he

161
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
hid himself in

162
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
the cavity

163
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
of a rock by

164
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
day, and by

165
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
night he

166
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
went forth

167
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
viewing the

168
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
things which

169
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,
should come upon the people.

170
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
14 And as

171
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
he dwelt in

172
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
the cavity

173
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
of a rock

174
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
he made the

175
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
remainder

176
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
of this

177
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
record, viewing

178
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
the

179
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
destructions

180
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
which came upon

181
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,
the people, by night.

182
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
15 And it

183
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
came to

184
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
pass that in

185
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
that same

186
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
year in

187
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
which he

188
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
was cast out

189
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
from

190
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
among the

191
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
people there

192
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
began to be

193
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
a great

194
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
war among

195
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
the people,

196
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
for there

197
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
were many

198
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
who rose

199
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
up, who

200
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
were mighty

201
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
men, and

202
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
sought to

203
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
destroy

204
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
Coriantumr by

205
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
their

206
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
secret plans

207
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
of

208
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,
wickedness, of which hath been spoken.

209
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
16 And

210
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
now

211
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
Coriantumr,

212
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
having

213
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
studied,

214
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
himself, in all

215
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
the arts

216
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
of war

217
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
and all

218
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
the cunning

219
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
of the

220
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
world,

221
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
wherefore he

222
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
gave

223
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
battle unto

224
01:08:48,0 --> 01:08:48,0
them who

225
