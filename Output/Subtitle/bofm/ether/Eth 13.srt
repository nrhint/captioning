00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,4
Chapter 13 Ether speaks of a New Jerusalem to be

2
00:00:01,4 --> 00:00:02,8
 built in America by the seed of Joseph—He

3
00:00:02,8 --> 00:00:04,2
 prophesies, is cast out, writes the Jaredite history, and

4
00:00:04,2 --> 00:00:05,6
 foretells the destruction of the Jaredites—War

5
00:00:05,6 --> 00:00:07,0
 rages over all the land.

6
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:10,642
1 And now I, Moroni, proceed to finish my record

7
00:00:10,642 --> 00:00:13,309
 concerning the destruction of the people of whom I

8
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:15,976
 have been writing

9
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:16,949
2 For behold, they rejected all the words of

10
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:17,949
 Ether; for he truly told them of all things, from the

11
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:18,949
 beginning of man; and that after the waters had

12
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:19,949
 receded from off the face of this land it became a

13
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:20,949
 choice land above all other lands, a chosen land of

14
00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:21,949
 the Lord; wherefore the Lord would have that all

15
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:22,949
 men should serve him who dwell upon the face

16
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:23,949
 thereof

17
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:26,591
3 And that it was the place of the New Jerusalem,

18
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:29,258
 which should come down out of heaven, and the holy

19
00:00:29,258 --> 00:00:31,925
 sanctuary of the Lord

20
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:35,899
4 Behold, Ether saw the days of Christ, and he

21
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:39,899
 spake concerning a New Jerusalem upon this land

22
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:40,873
5 And he spake also concerning the house of

23
00:00:40,873 --> 00:00:41,873
 Israel, and the Jerusalem from whence Lehi should

24
00:00:41,873 --> 00:00:42,873
 come—after it should be destroyed it should be built up

25
00:00:42,873 --> 00:00:43,873
 again, a holy city unto the Lord; wherefore, it

26
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:44,873
 could not be a new Jerusalem for it had been in a

27
00:00:44,873 --> 00:00:45,873
 time of old; but it should be built up again, and

28
00:00:45,873 --> 00:00:46,873
 become a holy city of the Lord; and it should be

29
00:00:46,873 --> 00:00:47,873
 built unto the house of Israel

30
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:50,515
6 And that a New Jerusalem should be built up upon

31
00:00:50,515 --> 00:00:53,182
 this land, unto the remnant of the seed of

32
00:00:53,182 --> 00:00:55,849
 Joseph, for which things there has been a type

33
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:56,965
7 For as Joseph brought his father down into the

34
00:00:56,965 --> 00:00:58,108
 land of Egypt, even so he died there; wherefore,

35
00:00:58,108 --> 00:00:59,251
 the Lord brought a remnant of the seed of Joseph out

36
00:00:59,251 --> 00:01:00,394
 of the land of Jerusalem, that he might be

37
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:01,537
 merciful unto the seed of Joseph that they should perish

38
00:01:01,537 --> 00:01:02,68
 not, even as he was merciful unto the father of

39
00:01:02,68 --> 00:01:03,823
 Joseph that he should perish not

40
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,13
8 Wherefore, the remnant of the house of Joseph

41
00:01:05,13 --> 00:01:06,463
 shall be built upon this land; and it shall be a

42
00:01:06,463 --> 00:01:07,796
 land of their inheritance; and they shall build up a

43
00:01:07,796 --> 00:01:09,129
 holy city unto the Lord, like unto the Jerusalem

44
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:10,462
 of old; and they shall no more be confounded, until

45
00:01:10,462 --> 00:01:11,795
 the end come when the earth shall pass away

46
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:19,772
9 And there shall be a new heaven and a new earth;

47
00:01:19,772 --> 00:01:27,772
 and they shall be like unto the old save the old

48
00:01:27,772 --> 00:01:35,772
 have passed away, and all things have become new

49
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,029
10 And then cometh the New Jerusalem; and blessed

50
00:01:37,029 --> 00:01:38,362
 are they who dwell therein, for it is they whose

51
00:01:38,362 --> 00:01:39,695
 garments are white through the blood of the Lamb;

52
00:01:39,695 --> 00:01:41,028
 and they are they who are numbered among the

53
00:01:41,028 --> 00:01:42,361
 remnant of the seed of Joseph, who were of the house of

54
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:43,694
 Israel

55
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:45,67
11 And then also cometh the Jerusalem of old; and

56
00:01:45,67 --> 00:01:47,67
 the inhabitants thereof, blessed are they, for

57
00:01:47,67 --> 00:01:49,67
 they have been washed in the blood of the Lamb; and

58
00:01:49,67 --> 00:01:51,67
 they are they who were scattered and gathered in

59
00:01:51,67 --> 00:01:53,67
 from the four quarters of the earth, and from the

60
00:01:53,67 --> 00:01:55,67
 north countries, and are partakers of the fulfilling

61
00:01:55,67 --> 00:01:57,67
 of the covenant which God made with their father,

62
00:01:57,67 --> 00:01:59,67
 Abraham

63
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:01,62
12 And when these things come, bringeth to pass

64
00:02:01,62 --> 00:02:03,62
 the scripture which saith, there are they who were

65
00:02:03,62 --> 00:02:05,62
 first, who shall be last; and there are they who

66
00:02:05,62 --> 00:02:07,62
 were last, who shall be first

67
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:08,927
13 And I was about to write more, but I am

68
00:02:08,927 --> 00:02:10,26
 forbidden; but great and marvelous were the prophecies of

69
00:02:10,26 --> 00:02:11,593
 Ether; but they esteemed him as naught, and cast

70
00:02:11,593 --> 00:02:12,926
 him out; and he hid himself in the cavity of a

71
00:02:12,926 --> 00:02:14,259
 rock by day, and by night he went forth viewing the

72
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,592
 things which should come upon the people

73
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:18,236
14 And as he dwelt in the cavity of a rock he made

74
00:02:18,236 --> 00:02:20,903
 the remainder of this record, viewing the

75
00:02:20,903 --> 00:02:23,57
 destructions which came upon the people, by night

76
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:24,876
15 And it came to pass that in that same year in

77
00:02:24,876 --> 00:02:26,209
 which he was cast out from among the people there

78
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:27,542
 began to be a great war among the people, for there

79
00:02:27,542 --> 00:02:28,875
 were many who rose up, who were mighty men, and

80
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:30,208
 sought to destroy Coriantumr by their secret plans

81
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:31,541
 of wickedness, of which hath been spoken

82
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,518
16 And now Coriantumr, having studied, himself, in

83
00:02:33,518 --> 00:02:35,518
 all the arts of war and all the cunning of the

84
00:02:35,518 --> 00:02:37,518
 world, wherefore he gave battle unto them who sought

85
00:02:37,518 --> 00:02:39,518
 to destroy him

86
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:40,826
17 But he repented not, neither his fair sons nor

87
00:02:40,826 --> 00:02:42,159
 daughters; neither the fair sons and daughters of

88
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,492
 Cohor; neither the fair sons and daughters of

89
00:02:43,492 --> 00:02:44,825
 Corihor; and in fine, there were none of the fair sons

90
00:02:44,825 --> 00:02:46,158
 and daughters upon the face of the whole earth

91
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:47,491
 who repented of their sins

92
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,067
18 Wherefore, it came to pass that in the first

93
00:02:49,067 --> 00:02:50,667
 year that Ether dwelt in the cavity of a rock, there

94
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:52,267
 were many people who were slain by the sword of

95
00:02:52,267 --> 00:02:53,867
 those secret combinations, fighting against

96
00:02:53,867 --> 00:02:55,467
 Coriantumr that they might obtain the kingdom

97
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:59,442
19 And it came to pass that the sons of Coriantumr

98
00:02:59,442 --> 00:03:03,442
 fought much and bled much

99
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,017
20 And in the second year the word of the Lord

100
00:03:05,017 --> 00:03:06,617
 came to Ether, that he should go and prophesy unto

101
00:03:06,617 --> 00:03:08,217
 Coriantumr that, if he would repent, and all his

102
00:03:08,217 --> 00:03:09,817
 household, the Lord would give unto him his kingdom

103
00:03:09,817 --> 00:03:11,417
 and spare the people

104
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:12,534
21 Otherwise they should be destroyed, and all his

105
00:03:12,534 --> 00:03:13,677
 household save it were himself. And he should

106
00:03:13,677 --> 00:03:14,82
 only live to see the fulfilling of the prophecies

107
00:03:14,82 --> 00:03:15,963
 which had been spoken concerning another people

108
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:17,106
 receiving the land for their inheritance; and

109
00:03:17,106 --> 00:03:18,249
 Coriantumr should receive a burial by them; and every soul

110
00:03:18,249 --> 00:03:19,392
 should be destroyed save it were Coriantumr

111
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,966
22 And it came to pass that Coriantumr repented

112
00:03:20,966 --> 00:03:22,566
 not, neither his household, neither the people; and

113
00:03:22,566 --> 00:03:24,166
 the wars ceased not; and they sought to kill

114
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,766
 Ether, but he fled from before them and hid again in

115
00:03:25,766 --> 00:03:27,366
 the cavity of the rock

116
00:03:27,34 --> 00:03:29,34
23 And it came to pass that there arose up Shared,

117
00:03:29,34 --> 00:03:31,34
 and he also gave battle unto Coriantumr; and he

118
00:03:31,34 --> 00:03:33,34
 did beat him, insomuch that in the third year he

119
00:03:33,34 --> 00:03:35,34
 did bring him into captivity

120
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,982
24 And the sons of Coriantumr, in the fourth year,

121
00:03:37,982 --> 00:03:40,649
 did beat Shared, and did obtain the kingdom again

122
00:03:40,649 --> 00:03:43,316
 unto their father

123
00:03:43,29 --> 00:03:45,957
25 Now there began to be a war upon all the face

124
00:03:45,957 --> 00:03:48,624
 of the land, every man with his band fighting for

125
00:03:48,624 --> 00:03:51,291
 that which he desired

126
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:55,264
26 And there were robbers, and in fine, all manner

127
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:59,264
 of wickedness upon all the face of the land

128
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,439
27 And it came to pass that Coriantumr was

129
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:05,639
 exceedingly angry with Shared, and he went against him

130
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:08,839
 with his armies to battle; and they did meet in

131
00:04:08,839 --> 00:04:12,039
 great anger, and they did meet in the valley of

132
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:15,239
 Gilgal; and the battle became exceedingly sore

133
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:19,188
28 And it came to pass that Shared fought against

134
00:04:19,188 --> 00:04:23,188
 him for the space of three days. And it came to

135
00:04:23,188 --> 00:04:27,188
 pass that Coriantumr beat him, and did pursue him

136
00:04:27,188 --> 00:04:31,188
 until he came to the plains of Heshlon

137
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:33,138
29 And it came to pass that Shared gave him battle

138
00:04:33,138 --> 00:04:35,138
 again upon the plains; and behold, he did beat

139
00:04:35,138 --> 00:04:37,138
 Coriantumr, and drove him back again to the valley

140
00:04:37,138 --> 00:04:39,138
 of Gilgal

141
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,779
30 And Coriantumr gave Shared battle again in the

142
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:44,446
 valley of Gilgal, in which he beat Shared and slew

143
00:04:44,446 --> 00:04:47,113
 him

144
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:48,687
31 And Shared wounded Coriantumr in his thigh,

145
00:04:48,687 --> 00:04:50,287
 that he did not go to battle again for the space of

146
00:04:50,287 --> 00:04:51,887
 two years, in which time all the people upon the

147
00:04:51,887 --> 00:04:53,487
 face of the land were shedding blood, and there was

148
00:04:53,487 --> 00:04:55,087
 none to restrain them.
