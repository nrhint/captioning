1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:08,25
The Book of Ether The record of the Jaredites,

2
00:00:08,25 --> 00:00:16,5
 taken from the twenty-four plates found by the people

3
00:00:16,5 --> 00:00:24,75
 of Limhi in the days of King Mosiah.Chapter 1

4
00:00:24,75 --> 00:00:33,0
 Moroni abridges the writings of Ether—Ether’s

5
00:00:33,0 --> 00:00:41,25
 genealogy is set forth—The language of the Jaredites is

6
00:00:41,25 --> 00:00:49,5
 not confounded at the Tower of Babel—The Lord

7
00:00:49,5 --> 00:00:57,75
 promises to lead them to a choice land and make them a

8
00:00:57,75 --> 00:01:06,0
 great nation.

9
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:11,166
1 And now I, Moroni, proceed to give an account of

10
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:16,166
 those ancient inhabitants who were destroyed by

11
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:21,166
 the hand of the Lord upon the face of this north

12
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:26,166
 country

13
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:32,287
2 And I take mine account from the twenty and four

14
00:01:32,287 --> 00:01:37,62
 plates which were found by the people of Limhi,

15
00:01:37,62 --> 00:01:42,953
 which is called the Book of Ether

16
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:48,603
3 And as I suppose that the first part of this

17
00:01:48,603 --> 00:01:54,77
 record, which speaks concerning the creation of the

18
00:01:54,77 --> 00:02:00,937
 world, and also of Adam, and an account from that

19
00:02:00,937 --> 00:02:07,104
 time even to the great tower, and whatsoever things

20
00:02:07,104 --> 00:02:13,271
 transpired among the children of men until that

21
00:02:13,271 --> 00:02:19,438
 time, is had among the Jews

22
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:25,373
4 Therefore I do not write those things which

23
00:02:25,373 --> 00:02:31,373
 transpired from the days of Adam until that time; but

24
00:02:31,373 --> 00:02:37,373
 they are had upon the plates; and whoso findeth

25
00:02:37,373 --> 00:02:43,373
 them, the same will have power that he may get the

26
00:02:43,373 --> 00:02:49,373
 full account

27
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:56,27
5 But behold, I give not the full account, but a

28
00:02:56,27 --> 00:03:02,937
 part of the account I give, from the tower down

29
00:03:02,937 --> 00:03:09,604
 until they were destroyed

30
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:16,289
6 And on this wise do I give the account. He that

31
00:03:16,289 --> 00:03:22,622

33 Which Jared came forth with his brother and

62
00:06:25,542 --> 00:06:30,971
 their families, with some others and their families,

63
00:06:30,971 --> 00:06:36,4
 from the great tower, at the time the Lord

64
00:06:36,4 --> 00:06:41,829
 confounded the language of the people, and swore in his

65
00:06:41,829 --> 00:06:47,258
 wrath that they should be scattered upon all the

66
00:06:47,258 --> 00:06:52,687
 face of the earth; and according to the word of the

67
00:06:52,687 --> 00:06:58,116
 Lord the people were scattered

68
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:05,185
34 And the brother of Jared being a large and

69
00:07:05,185 --> 00:07:11,585
 mighty man, and a man highly favored of the Lord,

70
00:07:11,585 --> 00:07:17,985
 Jared, his brother, said unto him: Cry unto the Lord,

71
00:07:17,985 --> 00:07:24,385
 that he will not confound us that we may not

72
00:07:24,385 --> 00:07:30,785
 understand our words

73
00:07:30,45 --> 00:07:35,25
35 And it came to pass that the brother of Jared

74
00:07:35,25 --> 00:07:40,05
 did cry unto the Lord, and the Lord had compassion

75
00:07:40,05 --> 00:07:44,85
 upon Jared; therefore he did not confound the

76
00:07:44,85 --> 00:07:49,65
 language of Jared; and Jared and his brother were not

77
00:07:49,65 --> 00:07:54,45
 confounded

78
00:07:54,14 --> 00:08:00,14
36 Then Jared said unto his brother: Cry again

79
00:08:00,14 --> 00:08:06,14
 unto the Lord, and it may be that he will turn away

80
00:08:06,14 --> 00:08:12,14
 his anger from them who are our friends, that he

81
00:08:12,14 --> 00:08:18,14
 confound not their language

82
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:23,181
37 And it came to pass that the brother of Jared

83
00:08:23,181 --> 00:08:27,931
 did cry unto the Lord, and the Lord had compassion

84
00:08:27,931 --> 00:08:32,681
 upon their friends and their families also, that

85
00:08:32,681 --> 00:08:37,431
 they were not confounded

86
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:43,462
38 And it came to pass that Jared spake again unto

87
00:08:43,462 --> 00:08:49,24
 his brother, saying: Go and inquire of the Lord

88
00:08:49,24 --> 00:08:55,018
 whether he will drive us out of the land, and if he

89
00:08:55,018 --> 00:09:00,796
 will drive us out of the land, cry unto him

90
00:09:00,796 --> 00:09:06,574
 whither we shall go. And who knoweth but the Lord will

91
00:09:06,574 --> 00:09:12,352
 carry us forth into a land which is choice above

92
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:18,13
 all the earth? And if it so be, let us be faithful

93
00:09:18,13 --> 00:09:23,908
 unto the Lord, that we may receive it for our

94
00:09:23,908 --> 00:09:29,686
 inheritance

95
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:33,536
39 And it came to pass that the brother of Jared

96
00:09:33,536 --> 00:09:37,536
 did cry unto the Lord according to that which had

97
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:41,536
 been spoken by the mouth of Jared

98
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:45,181
40 And it came to pass that the Lord did hear the

99
00:09:45,181 --> 00:09:48,848
 brother of Jared, and had compassion upon him, and

100
00:09:48,848 --> 00:09:52,515
 said unto him

101
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:58,358
41 Go to and gather together thy flocks, both male

102
00:09:58,358 --> 00:10:04,191
 and female, of every kind; and also of the seed

103
00:10:04,191 --> 00:10:10,024
 of the earth of every kind; and thy families; and

104
00:10:10,024 --> 00:10:15,857
 also Jared thy brother and his family; and also thy

105
00:10:15,857 --> 00:10:21,69
 friends and their families, and the friends of

106
00:10:21,69 --> 00:10:27,523
 Jared and their families

107
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:33,961
42 And when thou hast done this thou shalt go at

108
00:10:33,961 --> 00:10:39,961
 the head of them down into the valley which is

109
00:10:39,961 --> 00:10:45,961
 northward. And there will I meet thee, and I will go

110
00:10:45,961 --> 00:10:51,961
 before thee into a land which is choice above all

111
00:10:51,961 --> 00:10:57,961
 the lands of the earth

112
00:10:57,891 --> 00:11:04,766
43 And there will I bless thee and thy seed, and

113
00:11:04,766 --> 00:11:11,641
 raise up unto me of thy seed, and of the seed of

114
00:11:11,641 --> 00:11:18,516
 thy brother, and they who shall go with thee, a

115
00:11:18,516 --> 00:11:25,391
 great nation. And there shall be none greater than the

116
00:11:25,391 --> 00:11:32,266
 nation which I will raise up unto me of thy seed,

117
00:11:32,266 --> 00:11:39,141
 upon all the face of the earth. And thus I will

118
00:11:39,141 --> 00:11:46,016
 do unto thee because this long time ye have cried

119
00:11:46,016 --> 00:11:52,891
 unto me.
