00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
The Book of Ether The record of the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Jaredites, taken from the twenty-four plates found by

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the people of Limhi in the days of King

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Mosiah.Chapter 1 Moroni abridges the writings of

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Ether—Ether’s genealogy is set forth—The

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
language of the Jaredites is not confounded at the

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Tower of Babel—The Lord promises to lead

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:11:43,
them to a choice land and make them a great nation. 

9
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
1 And now I, Moroni, proceed to give an

10
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
account of those ancient inhabitants

11
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
who were destroyed by the hand of the

12
00:11:43,0 --> 00:19:12,
Lord upon the face of this north country.

13
00:19:12,0 --> 00:19:12,0
2 And I take mine account from

14
00:19:12,0 --> 00:19:12,0
the twenty and four plates which

15
00:19:12,0 --> 00:19:12,0
were found by the people of Limhi,

16
00:19:12,0 --> 00:29:51,
which is called the Book of Ether.

17
00:29:51,0 --> 00:29:51,0
3 And as I suppose that the

18
00:29:51,0 --> 00:29:51,0
first part of this record, which

19
00:29:51,0 --> 00:29:51,0
speaks concerning the

20
00:29:51,0 --> 00:29:51,0
creation of the world, and also of

21
00:29:51,0 --> 00:29:51,0
Adam, and an account from that

22
00:29:51,0 --> 00:29:51,0
time even to the great tower,

23
00:29:51,0 --> 00:29:51,0
and whatsoever things

24
00:29:51,0 --> 00:29:51,0
transpired among the children of men

25
00:29:51,0 --> 00:29:23,
until that time, is had among the Jews—

26
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
4 Therefore I do not write

27
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
those things which

28
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
transpired from the days of Adam

29
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
until that time; but they

30
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
are had upon the plates;

31
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
and whoso findeth them,

32
00:29:23,0 --> 00:29:23,0
the same will have power

33
00:29:23,0 --> 00:31:35,
that he may get the full account.

34
00:31:35,0 --> 00:31:35,0
5 But behold, I give not

35
00:31:35,0 --> 00:31:35,0
the full account, but a

36
00:31:35,0 --> 00:31:35,0
part of the account I

37
00:31:35,0 --> 00:31:35,0
give, from the tower down

38
00:31:35,0 --> 00:31:07,
until they were destroyed.

39
00:31:07,0 --> 00:31:07,0
6 And on this wise do I

40
00:31:07,0 --> 00:31:07,0
give the account. He

41
00:31:07,0 --> 00:31:07,0
