00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 14 The iniquity of the people

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
brings a curse upon the land—Coriantumr

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
engages in warfare against Gilead, then Lib, and

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:16:10,
then Shiz—Blood and carnage cover the land. 

5
00:16:10,0 --> 00:16:10,0
1 And now there began to be a great

6
00:16:10,0 --> 00:16:10,0
curse upon all the land because of

7
00:16:10,0 --> 00:16:10,0
the iniquity of the people, in which,

8
00:16:10,0 --> 00:16:10,0
if a man should lay his tool or his

9
00:16:10,0 --> 00:16:10,0
sword upon his shelf, or upon the

10
00:16:10,0 --> 00:16:10,0
place whither he would keep it,

11
00:16:10,0 --> 00:16:10,0
behold, upon the morrow, he could not

12
00:16:10,0 --> 00:31:52,
find it, so great was the curse upon the land.

13
00:31:52,0 --> 00:31:52,0
2 Wherefore every man did cleave

14
00:31:52,0 --> 00:31:52,0
unto that which was his own,

15
00:31:52,0 --> 00:31:52,0
with his hands, and would not

16
00:31:52,0 --> 00:31:52,0
borrow neither would he lend; and

17
00:31:52,0 --> 00:31:52,0
every man kept the hilt of his

18
00:31:52,0 --> 00:31:52,0
sword in his right hand, in the

19
00:31:52,0 --> 00:31:52,0
defence of his property and his own

20
00:31:52,0 --> 00:33:04,
life and of his wives and children.

21
00:33:04,0 --> 00:33:04,0
3 And now, after the space

22
00:33:04,0 --> 00:33:04,0
of two years, and after the

23
00:33:04,0 --> 00:33:04,0
death of Shared, behold,

24
00:33:04,0 --> 00:33:04,0
there arose the brother of

25
00:33:04,0 --> 00:33:04,0
Shared and he gave battle unto

26
00:33:04,0 --> 00:33:04,0
Coriantumr, in which

27
00:33:04,0 --> 00:33:04,0
Coriantumr did beat him and did

28
00:33:04,0 --> 00:42:13,
pursue him to the wilderness of Akish.

29
00:42:13,0 --> 00:42:13,0
4 And it came to pass

30
00:42:13,0 --> 00:42:13,0
that the brother of Shared

31
00:42:13,0 --> 00:42:13,0
did give battle unto him

32
00:42:13,0 --> 00:42:13,0
in the wilderness of

33
00:42:13,0 --> 00:42:13,0
Akish; and the battle became

34
00:42:13,0 --> 00:42:13,0
exceedingly sore, and many

35
00:42:13,0 --> 00:50:25,
thousands fell by the sword.

36
00:50:25,0 --> 00:50:25,0
5 And it came to pass

37
00:50:25,0 --> 00:50:25,0
that Coriantumr did lay

38
00:50:25,0 --> 00:50:25,0
siege to the

39
00:50:25,0 --> 00:50:25,0
wilderness; and the brother of

40
00:50:25,0 --> 00:50:25,0
Shared did march forth

41
00:50:25,0 --> 00:50:25,0
out of the wilderness by

42
00:50:25,0 --> 00:50:25,0
night, and slew a part

43
00:50:25,0 --> 00:50:25,0
of the army of

44
00:50:25,0 --> 01:05:04,
Coriantumr, as they were drunken.

45
01:05:04,0 --> 01:05:04,0
6 And he came forth to

46
01:05:04,0 --> 01:05:04,0
the land of Moron,

47
01:05:04,0 --> 01:05:04,0
and placed himself upon

48
01:05:04,0 --> 01:07:46,
the throne of Coriantumr.

49
01:07:46,0 --> 01:07:46,0
7 And it came to

50
01:07:46,0 --> 01:07:46,0
pass that Coriantumr

51
01:07:46,0 --> 01:07:46,0
dwelt with his army

52
01:07:46,0 --> 01:07:46,0
in the wilderness

53
01:07:46,0 --> 01:07:46,0
for the space of

54
01:07:46,0 --> 01:07:46,0
two years, in which

55
01:07:46,0 --> 01:07:46,0
he did receive great

56
01:07:46,0 --> 01:15:58,
strength to his army.

57
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0
8 Now the brother

58
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0
of Shared, whose

59
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0
name was Gilead,

60
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0
also received

61
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0
great strength to

62
01:15:58,0 --> 01:15:58,0
his army, because

63
01:15:58,0 --> 01:26:52,
of secret combinations.

64
01:26:52,0 --> 01:26:52,0
9 And it came to

65
01:26:52,0 --> 01:26:52,0
pass that his

66
01:26:52,0 --> 01:26:52,0
high priest

67
01:26:52,0 --> 01:26:52,0
murdered him as he

68
01:26:52,0 --> 01:28:04,
sat upon his throne.

69
01:28:04,0 --> 01:28:04,0
10 And it came

70
01:28:04,0 --> 01:28:04,0
to pass that

71
01:28:04,0 --> 01:28:04,0
one of the secret

72
01:28:04,0 --> 01:28:04,0
combinations

73
01:28:04,0 --> 01:28:04,0
murdered him in

74
01:28:04,0 --> 01:28:04,0
a secret pass,

75
01:28:04,0 --> 01:28:04,0
and obtained

76
01:28:04,0 --> 01:28:04,0
unto himself the

77
01:28:04,0 --> 01:28:04,0
kingdom; and

78
01:28:04,0 --> 01:28:04,0
his name was Lib;

79
01:28:04,0 --> 01:28:04,0
and Lib was a

80
01:28:04,0 --> 01:28:04,0
man of great

81
01:28:04,0 --> 01:28:04,0
stature, more

82
01:28:04,0 --> 01:28:04,0
than any other man

83
01:28:04,0 --> 01:33:47,
among all the people.

84
01:33:47,0 --> 01:33:47,0
11 And it

85
01:33:47,0 --> 01:33:47,0
came to pass

86
01:33:47,0 --> 01:33:47,0
that in the

87
01:33:47,0 --> 01:33:47,0
first year of

88
01:33:47,0 --> 01:33:47,0
Lib, Coriantumr

89
01:33:47,0 --> 01:33:47,0
came up unto

90
01:33:47,0 --> 01:33:47,0
the land of

91
01:33:47,0 --> 01:33:47,0
Moron, and

92
01:33:47,0 --> 01:36:57,
gave battle unto Lib.

93
01:36:57,0 --> 01:36:57,0
12 And it

94
01:36:57,0 --> 01:36:57,0
came to pass

95
01:36:57,0 --> 01:36:57,0
that he

96
01:36:57,0 --> 01:36:57,0
fought with Lib,

97
01:36:57,0 --> 01:36:57,0
in which Lib

98
01:36:57,0 --> 01:36:57,0
did smite

99
01:36:57,0 --> 01:36:57,0
upon his arm

100
01:36:57,0 --> 01:36:57,0
that he was

101
01:36:57,0 --> 01:36:57,0
wounded;

102
01:36:57,0 --> 01:36:57,0
nevertheless,

103
01:36:57,0 --> 01:36:57,0
the army of

104
01:36:57,0 --> 01:36:57,0
Coriantumr

105
01:36:57,0 --> 01:36:57,0
did press

106
01:36:57,0 --> 01:36:57,0
forward upon

107
01:36:57,0 --> 01:36:57,0
Lib, that he

108
01:36:57,0 --> 01:36:57,0
fled to the

109
01:36:57,0 --> 01:40:56,
borders upon the seashore.

110
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
13 And it

111
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
came to pass

112
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
that

113
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
Coriantumr

114
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
pursued him; and

115
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
Lib gave

116
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
battle unto

117
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
him upon

118
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,
the seashore.

119
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
14 And it

120
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
came to

121
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
pass that

122
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
Lib did

123
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
smite the army

124
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
of

125
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
Coriantumr, that

126
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
they fled

127
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
again to

128
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
the

129
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,
wilderness of Akish.

130
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
15 And it

131
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
came to

132
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
pass that

133
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
Lib did

134
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
pursue him

135
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
until he came

136
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
to the

137
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
plains of

138
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
Agosh. And

139
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
Coriantumr

140
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
had taken

141
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
all the

142
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
people with

143
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
him as he

144
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
fled

145
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
before Lib in

146
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
that

147
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
quarter of the

148
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
land

149
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,
whither he fled.

150
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
16 And

151
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
when he had

152
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
come to

153
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
the

154
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
plains of

155
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
Agosh he gave

156
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
battle

157
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
unto Lib,

158
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
and he

159
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
smote upon

160
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
him until

161
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
he died;

162
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0


163
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
nevertheless, the

164
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
brother

165
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
of Lib

166
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
did come

167
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
against

168
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
Coriantumr

169
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
in the

170
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
stead

171
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
thereof, and

172
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
the battle

173
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
became

174
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
exceedingly

175
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
sore, in

176
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
the

177
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
which

178
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
Coriantumr fled

179
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
again

180
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,
before the army of the brother of Lib.

181
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
17 Now

182
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
the name

183
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
of the

184
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
brother

185
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
of Lib

186
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
was called

187
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
Shiz.

188
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
And it

189
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
came to

190
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
pass that

191
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
Shiz

192
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
pursued

193
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
after

194
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
Coriantumr,

195
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
and he

196
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
did

197
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
overthrow many

198
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
cities,

199
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
and he

200
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
did slay

201
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
both

202
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
women and

203
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0


204
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,
children, and he did burn the cities.

205
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
18 And

206
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
there

207
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
went a

208
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
fear of

209
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
Shiz

210
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0


211
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
throughout all

212
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
the

213
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
land; yea,

214
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
a cry

215
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
went

216
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
forth

217
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
throughout

218
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
the

219
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
land—Who

220
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
can

221
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
stand

222
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
before the

223
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
army of

224
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
Shiz?

225
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
Behold,

226
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
he

227
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,
sweepeth the earth before him!

228
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
19 And

229
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
it

230
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
came to

231
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
pass

232
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
that

233
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
the

234
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
people

235
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
began to

236
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
flock

237
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0


238
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
together in

239
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0


240
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
armies,

241
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
throughout

242
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
all

243
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,
the face of the land.

244
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
20

245
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
And

246
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
they

247
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
were

248
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
divided;

249
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
and

250
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
a

251
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
part of

252
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
them

253
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
fled

254
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
to

255
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
the

256
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
army of

257
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
Shiz,

258
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
and

259
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
a

260
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
part of

261
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
them

262
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
fled

263
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
to

264
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,
the army of Coriantumr.

265
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
21

266
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
And so

267
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
great

268
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
and

269
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0


270
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
lasting

271
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
had

272
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
been the

273
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
war,

274
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
and

275
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
so

276
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
long

277
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
had

278
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
been the

279
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0


280
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
scene of

281
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0


282
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
bloodshed

283
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
and

284
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0


285
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
carnage,

286
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
that

287
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
the

288
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
whole

289
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
face of

290
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
the

291
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
land

292
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
was

293
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0


294
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
covered

295
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
with the

296
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0


297
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
bodies of

298
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
the

300
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
22

301
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
And so

302
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
swift

303
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
and

304
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0


305
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
speedy was

306
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
the

307
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
war

308
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
that

309
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
there

310
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
was

311
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
none

312
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0

313
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0

314
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
bury the

315
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0


316
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
dead, but

317
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
they

318
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
did

319
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
march

320
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0

01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0


329
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0

01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0

332
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0


333
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
leaving

359
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
And

360
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
the

01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0

395
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,
