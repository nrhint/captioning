00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,75
Chapter 14 The iniquity of the people brings a

2
00:00:01,75 --> 00:00:03,5
 curse upon the land—Coriantumr engages in warfare

3
00:00:03,5 --> 00:00:05,25
 against Gilead, then Lib, and then Shiz—Blood and

4
00:00:05,25 --> 00:00:07,0
 carnage cover the land.

5
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,308
1 And now there began to be a great curse upon all

6
00:00:09,308 --> 00:00:10,641
 the land because of the iniquity of the people,

7
00:00:10,641 --> 00:00:11,974
 in which, if a man should lay his tool or his sword

8
00:00:11,974 --> 00:00:13,307
 upon his shelf, or upon the place whither he

9
00:00:13,307 --> 00:00:14,64
 would keep it, behold, upon the morrow, he could not

10
00:00:14,64 --> 00:00:15,973
 find it, so great was the curse upon the land

11
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,282
2 Wherefore every man did cleave unto that which

12
00:00:17,282 --> 00:00:18,615
 was his own, with his hands, and would not borrow

13
00:00:18,615 --> 00:00:19,948
 neither would he lend; and every man kept the hilt

14
00:00:19,948 --> 00:00:21,281
 of his sword in his right hand, in the defence of

15
00:00:21,281 --> 00:00:22,614
 his property and his own life and of his wives and

16
00:00:22,614 --> 00:00:23,947
 children

17
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,524
3 And now, after the space of two years, and after

18
00:00:25,524 --> 00:00:27,124
 the death of Shared, behold, there arose the

19
00:00:27,124 --> 00:00:28,724
 brother of Shared and he gave battle unto Coriantumr,

20
00:00:28,724 --> 00:00:30,324
 in which Coriantumr did beat him and did pursue

21
00:00:30,324 --> 00:00:31,924
 him to the wilderness of Akish

22
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,899
4 And it came to pass that the brother of Shared

23
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,899
 did give battle unto him in the wilderness of

24
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:37,899
 Akish; and the battle became exceedingly sore, and many

25
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:39,899
 thousands fell by the sword

26
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,473
5 And it came to pass that Coriantumr did lay

27
00:00:41,473 --> 00:00:43,073
 siege to the wilderness; and the brother of Shared did

28
00:00:43,073 --> 00:00:44,673
 march forth out of the wilderness by night, and

29
00:00:44,673 --> 00:00:46,273
 slew a part of the army of Coriantumr, as they were

30
00:00:46,273 --> 00:00:47,873
 drunken

31
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:51,848
6 And he came forth to the land of Moron, and

32
00:00:51,848 --> 00:00:55,848
 placed himself upon the throne of Coriantumr

33
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,822
7 And it came to pass that Coriantumr dwelt with

34
00:00:57,822 --> 00:00:59,822
 his army in the wilderness for the space of two

35
00:00:59,822 --> 00:01:01,822
 years, in which he did receive great strength to his

36
00:01:01,822 --> 00:01:03,822
 army

37
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:06,464
8 Now the brother of Shared, whose name was

38
00:01:06,464 --> 00:01:09,131
 Gilead, also received great strength to his army,

39
00:01:09,131 --> 00:01:11,798
 because of secret combinations

40
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:15,772
9 And it came to pass that his high priest

41
00:01:15,772 --> 00:01:19,772
 murdered him as he sat upon his throne

42
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,346
10 And it came to pass that one of the secret

43
00:01:21,346 --> 00:01:22,946
 combinations murdered him in a secret pass, and

44
00:01:22,946 --> 00:01:24,546
 obtained unto himself the kingdom; and his name was Lib;

45
00:01:24,546 --> 00:01:26,146
 and Lib was a man of great stature, more than any

46
00:01:26,146 --> 00:01:27,746
 other man among all the people

47
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:30,388
11 And it came to pass that in the first year of

48
00:01:30,388 --> 00:01:33,055
 Lib, Coriantumr came up unto the land of Moron, and

49
00:01:33,055 --> 00:01:35,722
 gave battle unto Lib

50
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,296
12 And it came to pass that he fought with Lib, in

51
00:01:37,296 --> 00:01:38,896
 which Lib did smite upon his arm that he was

52
00:01:38,896 --> 00:01:40,496
 wounded; nevertheless, the army of Coriantumr did

53
00:01:40,496 --> 00:01:42,096
 press forward upon Lib, that he fled to the borders

54
00:01:42,096 --> 00:01:43,696
 upon the seashore

55
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:47,67
13 And it came to pass that Coriantumr pursued

56
00:01:47,67 --> 00:01:51,67
 him; and Lib gave battle unto him upon the seashore

57
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:54,312
14 And it came to pass that Lib did smite the army

58
00:01:54,312 --> 00:01:56,979
 of Coriantumr, that they fled again to the

59
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:59,646
 wilderness of Akish

60
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:01,219
15 And it came to pass that Lib did pursue him

61
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:02,82
 until he came to the plains of Agosh. And Coriantumr

62
00:02:02,82 --> 00:02:04,419
 had taken all the people with him as he fled

63
00:02:04,419 --> 00:02:06,02
 before Lib in that quarter of the land whither he fled

64
00:02:06,02 --> 00:02:07,62


65
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:08,737
16 And when he had come to the plains of Agosh he

66
00:02:08,737 --> 00:02:09,88
 gave battle unto Lib, and he smote upon him until

67
00:02:09,88 --> 00:02:11,023
 he died; nevertheless, the brother of Lib did come

68
00:02:11,023 --> 00:02:12,166
 against Coriantumr in the stead thereof, and the

69
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:13,309
 battle became exceedingly sore, in the which

70
00:02:13,309 --> 00:02:14,452
 Coriantumr fled again before the army of the brother of

71
00:02:14,452 --> 00:02:15,595
 Lib

72
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:17,169
17 Now the name of the brother of Lib was called

73
00:02:17,169 --> 00:02:18,769
 Shiz. And it came to pass that Shiz pursued after

74
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:20,369
 Coriantumr, and he did overthrow many cities, and

75
00:02:20,369 --> 00:02:21,969
 he did slay both women and children, and he did

76
00:02:21,969 --> 00:02:23,569
 burn the cities

77
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,543
18 And there went a fear of Shiz throughout all

78
00:02:25,543 --> 00:02:27,543
 the land; yea, a cry went forth throughout the

79
00:02:27,543 --> 00:02:29,543
 land—Who can stand before the army of Shiz? Behold, he

80
00:02:29,543 --> 00:02:31,543
 sweepeth the earth before him

81
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:34,185
19 And it came to pass that the people began to

82
00:02:34,185 --> 00:02:36,852
 flock together in armies, throughout all the face of

83
00:02:36,852 --> 00:02:39,519
 the land

84
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:42,16
20 And they were divided; and a part of them fled

85
00:02:42,16 --> 00:02:44,827
 to the army of Shiz, and a part of them fled to

86
00:02:44,827 --> 00:02:47,494
 the army of Coriantumr

87
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,467
21 And so great and lasting had been the war, and

88
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:51,467
 so long had been the scene of bloodshed and

89
00:02:51,467 --> 00:02:53,467
 carnage, that the whole face of the land was covered

90
00:02:53,467 --> 00:02:55,467
 with the bodies of the dead

91
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:56,775
22 And so swift and speedy was the war that there

92
00:02:56,775 --> 00:02:58,108
 was none left to bury the dead, but they did march

93
00:02:58,108 --> 00:02:59,441
 forth from the shedding of blood to the shedding

94
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:00,774
 of blood, leaving the bodies of both men, women,

95
00:03:00,774 --> 00:03:02,107
 and children strewed upon the face of the land, to

96
00:03:02,107 --> 00:03:03,44
 become a prey to the worms of the flesh

97
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,417
23 And the scent thereof went forth upon the face

98
00:03:05,417 --> 00:03:07,417
 of the land, even upon all the face of the land;

99
00:03:07,417 --> 00:03:09,417
 wherefore the people became troubled by day and by

100
00:03:09,417 --> 00:03:11,417
 night, because of the scent thereof

101
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:12,991
24 Nevertheless, Shiz did not cease to pursue

102
00:03:12,991 --> 00:03:14,591
 Coriantumr; for he had sworn to avenge himself upon

103
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:16,191
 Coriantumr of the blood of his brother, who had been

104
00:03:16,191 --> 00:03:17,791
 slain, and the word of the Lord which came to

105
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,391
 Ether that Coriantumr should not fall by the sword

106
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,366
25 And thus we see that the Lord did visit them in

107
00:03:21,366 --> 00:03:23,366
 the fulness of his wrath, and their wickedness

108
00:03:23,366 --> 00:03:25,366
 and abominations had prepared a way for their

109
00:03:25,366 --> 00:03:27,366
 everlasting destruction

110
00:03:27,34 --> 00:03:29,34
26 And it came to pass that Shiz did pursue

111
00:03:29,34 --> 00:03:31,34
 Coriantumr eastward, even to the borders by the

112
00:03:31,34 --> 00:03:33,34
 seashore, and there he gave battle unto Shiz for the space

113
00:03:33,34 --> 00:03:35,34
 of three days

114
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:36,648
27 And so terrible was the destruction among the

115
00:03:36,648 --> 00:03:37,981
 armies of Shiz that the people began to be

116
00:03:37,981 --> 00:03:39,314
 frightened, and began to flee before the armies of

117
00:03:39,314 --> 00:03:40,647
 Coriantumr; and they fled to the land of Corihor, and

118
00:03:40,647 --> 00:03:41,98
 swept off the inhabitants before them, all them that

119
00:03:41,98 --> 00:03:43,313
 would not join them

120
00:03:43,29 --> 00:03:44,433
28 And they pitched their tents in the valley of

121
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:45,576
 Corihor; and Coriantumr pitched his tents in the

122
00:03:45,576 --> 00:03:46,719
 valley of Shurr. Now the valley of Shurr was near

123
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:47,862
 the hill Comnor; wherefore, Coriantumr did gather

124
00:03:47,862 --> 00:03:49,005
 his armies together upon the hill Comnor, and did

125
00:03:49,005 --> 00:03:50,148
 sound a trumpet unto the armies of Shiz to invite

126
00:03:50,148 --> 00:03:51,291
 them forth to battle

127
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:52,864
29 And it came to pass that they came forth, but

128
00:03:52,864 --> 00:03:54,464
 were driven again; and they came the second time,

129
00:03:54,464 --> 00:03:56,064
 and they were driven again the second time. And it

130
00:03:56,064 --> 00:03:57,664
 came to pass that they came again the third time,

131
00:03:57,664 --> 00:03:59,264
 and the battle became exceedingly sore

132
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,239
30 And it came to pass that Shiz smote upon

133
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:03,239
 Coriantumr that he gave him many deep wounds; and

134
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,239
 Coriantumr, having lost his blood, fainted, and was

135
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:07,239
 carried away as though he were dead

136
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:09,214
31 Now the loss of men, women and children on both

137
00:04:09,214 --> 00:04:11,214
 sides was so great that Shiz commanded his people

138
00:04:11,214 --> 00:04:13,214
 that they should not pursue the armies of

139
00:04:13,214 --> 00:04:15,214
 Coriantumr; wherefore, they returned to their camp.
