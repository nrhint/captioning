00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:08,0
Chapter 14 The iniquity of the people

2
00:00:08,0 --> 00:00:16,0
brings a curse upon the land—Coriantumr

3
00:00:16,0 --> 00:00:24,0
engages in warfare against Gilead, then Lib, and

4
00:00:24,0 --> 00:00:32,366
then Shiz—Blood and carnage cover the land. 

5
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:33,241
1 And now there began to be a great

6
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:34,116
curse upon all the land because of

7
00:00:34,116 --> 00:00:34,991
the iniquity of the people, in which,

8
00:00:34,991 --> 00:00:35,866
if a man should lay his tool or his

9
00:00:35,866 --> 00:00:36,741
sword upon his shelf, or upon the

10
00:00:36,741 --> 00:00:37,616
place whither he would keep it,

11
00:00:37,616 --> 00:00:38,491
behold, upon the morrow, he could not

12
00:00:38,491 --> 00:00:39,84
find it, so great was the curse upon the land.

13
00:00:39,84 --> 00:00:41,715
2 Wherefore every man did cleave

14
00:00:41,715 --> 00:00:43,59
unto that which was his own,

15
00:00:43,59 --> 00:00:45,465
with his hands, and would not

16
00:00:45,465 --> 00:00:47,34
borrow neither would he lend; and

17
00:00:47,34 --> 00:00:49,215
every man kept the hilt of his

18
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,09
sword in his right hand, in the

19
00:00:51,09 --> 00:00:52,965
defence of his property and his own

20
00:00:52,965 --> 00:00:54,821
life and of his wives and children.

21
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:55,946
3 And now, after the space

22
00:00:55,946 --> 00:00:57,071
of two years, and after the

23
00:00:57,071 --> 00:00:58,196
death of Shared, behold,

24
00:00:58,196 --> 00:00:59,321
there arose the brother of

25
00:00:59,321 --> 00:01:00,446
Shared and he gave battle unto

26
00:01:00,446 --> 00:01:01,571
Coriantumr, in which

27
00:01:01,571 --> 00:01:02,696
Coriantumr did beat him and did

28
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:03,263
pursue him to the wilderness of Akish.

29
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:03,12
4 And it came to pass

30
00:01:03,12 --> 00:01:02,977
that the brother of Shared

31
00:01:02,977 --> 00:01:02,834
did give battle unto him

32
00:01:02,834 --> 00:01:02,691
in the wilderness of

33
00:01:02,691 --> 00:01:02,548
Akish; and the battle became

34
00:01:02,548 --> 00:01:02,405
exceedingly sore, and many

35
00:01:02,405 --> 00:01:02,329
thousands fell by the sword.

36
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:02,551
5 And it came to pass

37
00:01:02,551 --> 00:01:02,773
that Coriantumr did lay

38
00:01:02,773 --> 00:01:02,995
siege to the

39
00:01:02,995 --> 00:01:03,217
wilderness; and the brother of

40
00:01:03,217 --> 00:01:03,439
Shared did march forth

41
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:03,661
out of the wilderness by

42
00:01:03,661 --> 00:01:03,883
night, and slew a part

43
00:01:03,883 --> 00:01:04,105
of the army of

44
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:04,731
Coriantumr, as they were drunken.

45
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:04,481
6 And he came forth to

46
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:04,231
the land of Moron,

47
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:03,981
and placed himself upon

48
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:03,797
the throne of Coriantumr.

49
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:03,672
7 And it came to

50
00:01:03,672 --> 00:01:03,547
pass that Coriantumr

51
00:01:03,547 --> 00:01:03,422
dwelt with his army

52
00:01:03,422 --> 00:01:03,297
in the wilderness

53
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:03,172
for the space of

54
00:01:03,172 --> 00:01:03,047
two years, in which

55
00:01:03,047 --> 00:01:02,922
he did receive great

56
00:01:02,922 --> 00:01:02,863
strength to his army.

57
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:02,72
8 Now the brother

58
00:01:02,72 --> 00:01:02,577
of Shared, whose

59
00:01:02,577 --> 00:01:02,434
name was Gilead,

60
00:01:02,434 --> 00:01:02,291
also received

61
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:02,148
great strength to

62
00:01:02,148 --> 00:01:02,005
his army, because

63
00:01:02,005 --> 00:01:01,929
of secret combinations.

64
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:02,529
9 And it came to

65
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:03,129
pass that his

66
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:03,729
high priest

67
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:04,329
murdered him as he

68
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:04,331
sat upon his throne.

69
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:04,931
10 And it came

70
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:05,531
to pass that

71
00:01:05,531 --> 00:01:06,131
one of the secret

72
00:01:06,131 --> 00:01:06,731
combinations

73
00:01:06,731 --> 00:01:07,331
murdered him in

74
00:01:07,331 --> 00:01:07,931
a secret pass,

75
00:01:07,931 --> 00:01:08,531
and obtained

76
00:01:08,531 --> 00:01:09,131
unto himself the

77
00:01:09,131 --> 00:01:09,731
kingdom; and

78
00:01:09,731 --> 00:01:10,331
his name was Lib;

79
00:01:10,331 --> 00:01:10,931
and Lib was a

80
00:01:10,931 --> 00:01:11,531
man of great

81
00:01:11,531 --> 00:01:12,131
stature, more

82
00:01:12,131 --> 00:01:12,731
than any other man

83
00:01:12,731 --> 00:01:13,74
among all the people.

84
00:01:13,74 --> 00:01:14,518
11 And it

85
00:01:14,518 --> 00:01:15,296
came to pass

86
00:01:15,296 --> 00:01:16,074
that in the

87
00:01:16,074 --> 00:01:16,852
first year of

88
00:01:16,852 --> 00:01:17,63
Lib, Coriantumr

89
00:01:17,63 --> 00:01:18,408
came up unto

90
00:01:18,408 --> 00:01:19,186
the land of

91
00:01:19,186 --> 00:01:19,964
Moron, and

92
00:01:19,964 --> 00:01:20,747
gave battle unto Lib.

93
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:21,041
12 And it

94
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:21,335
came to pass

95
00:01:21,335 --> 00:01:21,629
that he

96
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:21,923
fought with Lib,

97
00:01:21,923 --> 00:01:22,217
in which Lib

98
00:01:22,217 --> 00:01:22,511
did smite

99
00:01:22,511 --> 00:01:22,805
upon his arm

100
00:01:22,805 --> 00:01:23,099
that he was

101
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:23,393
wounded;

102
00:01:23,393 --> 00:01:23,687
nevertheless,

103
00:01:23,687 --> 00:01:23,981
the army of

104
00:01:23,981 --> 00:01:24,275
Coriantumr

105
00:01:24,275 --> 00:01:24,569
did press

106
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:24,863
forward upon

107
00:01:24,863 --> 00:01:25,157
Lib, that he

108
00:01:25,157 --> 00:01:25,451
fled to the

109
00:01:25,451 --> 00:01:25,152
borders upon the seashore.

110
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:25,596
13 And it

111
00:01:25,596 --> 00:01:26,04
came to pass

112
00:01:26,04 --> 00:01:26,484
that

113
00:01:26,484 --> 00:01:26,928
Coriantumr

114
00:01:26,928 --> 00:01:27,372
pursued him; and

115
00:01:27,372 --> 00:01:27,816
Lib gave

116
00:01:27,816 --> 00:01:28,26
battle unto

117
00:01:28,26 --> 00:01:28,704
him upon

118
00:01:28,704 --> 00:01:29,556
the seashore.

119
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:30,465
14 And it

120
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:31,374
came to

121
00:01:31,374 --> 00:01:32,283
pass that

122
00:01:32,283 --> 00:01:33,192
Lib did

123
00:01:33,192 --> 00:01:34,101
smite the army

124
00:01:34,101 --> 00:01:35,01
of

125
00:01:35,01 --> 00:01:35,919
Coriantumr, that

126
00:01:35,919 --> 00:01:36,828
they fled

127
00:01:36,828 --> 00:01:37,737
again to

128
00:01:37,737 --> 00:01:38,646
the

129
00:01:38,646 --> 00:01:39,933
wilderness of Akish.

130
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,633
15 And it

131
00:01:41,633 --> 00:01:43,333
came to

132
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:45,033
pass that

133
00:01:45,033 --> 00:01:46,733
Lib did

134
00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:48,433
pursue him

135
00:01:48,433 --> 00:01:50,133
until he came

136
00:01:50,133 --> 00:01:51,833
to the

137
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:53,533
plains of

138
00:01:53,533 --> 00:01:55,233
Agosh. And

139
00:01:55,233 --> 00:01:56,933
Coriantumr

140
00:01:56,933 --> 00:01:58,633
had taken

141
00:01:58,633 --> 00:02:00,333
all the

142
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:02,033
people with

143
00:02:02,033 --> 00:02:03,733
him as he

144
00:02:03,733 --> 00:02:05,433
fled

145
00:02:05,433 --> 00:02:07,133
before Lib in

146
00:02:07,133 --> 00:02:08,833
that

147
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:10,533
quarter of the

148
00:02:10,533 --> 00:02:12,233
land

149
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:13,767
whither he fled.

150
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:14,025
16 And

151
00:02:14,025 --> 00:02:14,283
when he had

152
00:02:14,283 --> 00:02:14,541
come to

153
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:14,799
the

154
00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:15,057
plains of

155
00:02:15,057 --> 00:02:15,315
Agosh he gave

156
00:02:15,315 --> 00:02:15,573
battle

157
00:02:15,573 --> 00:02:15,831
unto Lib,

158
00:02:15,831 --> 00:02:16,089
and he

159
00:02:16,089 --> 00:02:16,347
smote upon

160
00:02:16,347 --> 00:02:16,605
him until

161
00:02:16,605 --> 00:02:16,863
he died;

162
00:02:16,863 --> 00:02:17,121


163
00:02:17,121 --> 00:02:17,379
nevertheless, the

164
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:17,637
brother

165
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:17,895
of Lib

166
00:02:17,895 --> 00:02:18,153
did come

167
00:02:18,153 --> 00:02:18,411
against

168
00:02:18,411 --> 00:02:18,669
Coriantumr

169
00:02:18,669 --> 00:02:18,927
in the

170
00:02:18,927 --> 00:02:19,185
stead

171
00:02:19,185 --> 00:02:19,443
thereof, and

172
00:02:19,443 --> 00:02:19,701
the battle

173
00:02:19,701 --> 00:02:19,959
became

174
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:20,217
exceedingly

175
00:02:20,217 --> 00:02:20,475
sore, in

176
00:02:20,475 --> 00:02:20,733
the

177
00:02:20,733 --> 00:02:20,991
which

178
00:02:20,991 --> 00:02:21,249
Coriantumr fled

179
00:02:21,249 --> 00:02:21,507
again

180
00:02:21,507 --> 00:02:21,742
before the army of the brother of Lib.

181
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
17 Now

182
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
the name

183
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
of the

184
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
brother

185
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
of Lib

186
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
was called

187
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
Shiz.

188
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
And it

189
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
came to

190
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
pass that

191
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
Shiz

192
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
pursued

193
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
after

194
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
Coriantumr,

195
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
and he

196
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
did

197
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
overthrow many

198
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
cities,

199
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
and he

200
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
did slay

201
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
both

202
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
women and

203
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742


204
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
children, and he did burn the cities.

205
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
18 And

206
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
there

207
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
went a

208
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
fear of

209
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
Shiz

210
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742


211
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
throughout all

212
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
the

213
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
land; yea,

214
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
a cry

215
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
went

216
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
forth

217
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
throughout

218
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
the

219
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
land—Who

220
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
can

221
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
stand

222
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
before the

223
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
army of

224
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
Shiz?

225
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
Behold,

226
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
he

227
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
sweepeth the earth before him!

228
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
19 And

229
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
it

230
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
came to

231
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
pass

232
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
that

233
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
the

234
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
people

235
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
began to

236
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
flock

237
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742


238
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
together in

239
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742


240
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
armies,

241
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
throughout

242
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
all

243
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
the face of the land.

244
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
20

245
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
And

246
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
they

247
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
were

248
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
divided;

249
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
and

250
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
a

251
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
part of

252
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
them

253
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
fled

254
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
to

255
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
the

256
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
army of

257
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
Shiz,

258
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
and

259
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
a

260
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
part of

261
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
them

262
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
fled

263
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
to

264
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
the army of Coriantumr.

265
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
21

266
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
And so

267
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
great

268
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
and

269
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742


270
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
lasting

271
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
had

272
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
been the

273
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
war,

274
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
and

275
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
so

276
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
long

277
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
had

278
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
been the

279
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742


280
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
scene of

281
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742


282
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
bloodshed

283
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
and

284
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742


285
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
carnage,

286
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
that

287
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
the

288
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
whole

289
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
face of

290
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
the

291
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
land

292
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
was

293
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742


294
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
covered

295
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
with the

296
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742


297
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
bodies of

298
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
the

299
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
dead.

300
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
22

301
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
And so

302
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
swift

303
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
and

304
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742


305
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
speedy was

306
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
the

307
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
war

308
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
that

309
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
there

310
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
was

311
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
none

312
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742

314
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
bury the

316
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
dead, but

317
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
they

318
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
did

319
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
march

320
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742

325
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742

326
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742

327
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:21,742
