00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:08,0
Chapter 3 The brother of Jared sees the finger of

2
00:00:08,0 --> 00:00:16,0
 the Lord as He touches sixteen stones—Christ shows

3
00:00:16,0 --> 00:00:24,0
 His spirit body to the brother of Jared—Those who

4
00:00:24,0 --> 00:00:32,0
 have a perfect knowledge cannot be kept from

5
00:00:32,0 --> 00:00:40,0
 within the veil—Interpreters are provided to bring the

6
00:00:40,0 --> 00:00:48,0
 Jaredite record to light.

7
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:54,438
1 And it came to pass that the brother of Jared,

8
00:00:54,438 --> 00:01:00,327
 (now the number of the vessels which had been

9
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:06,216
 prepared was eight) went forth unto the mount, which

10
00:01:06,216 --> 00:01:12,105
 they called the mount Shelem, because of its

11
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:17,994
 exceeding height, and did molten out of a rock sixteen

12
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:23,883
 small stones; and they were white and clear, even as

13
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:29,772
 transparent glass; and he did carry them in his

14
00:01:29,772 --> 00:01:35,661
 hands upon the top of the mount, and cried again

15
00:01:35,661 --> 00:01:41,55
 unto the Lord, saying

16
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:47,168
2 O Lord, thou hast said that we must be

17
00:01:47,168 --> 00:01:52,568
 encompassed about by the floods. Now behold, O Lord, and do

18
00:01:52,568 --> 00:01:57,968
 not be angry with thy servant because of his

19
00:01:57,968 --> 00:02:03,368
 weakness before thee; for we know that thou art holy

20
00:02:03,368 --> 00:02:08,768
 and dwellest in the heavens, and that we are

21
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:14,168
 unworthy before thee; because of the fall our natures

22
00:02:14,168 --> 00:02:19,568
 have become evil continually; nevertheless, O Lord,

23
00:02:19,568 --> 00:02:24,968
 thou hast given us a commandment that we must call

24
00:02:24,968 --> 00:02:30,368
 upon thee, that from thee we may receive

25
00:02:30,368 --> 00:02:35,768
 according to our desires

26
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:41,122
3 Behold, O Lord, thou hast smitten us because of

27
00:02:41,122 --> 00:02:46,789
 our iniquity, and hast driven us forth, and for

28
00:02:46,789 --> 00:02:52,456
 these many years we have been in the wilderness;

29
00:02:52,456 --> 00:02:58,123
 nevertheless, thou hast been merciful unto us. O

30
00:02:58,123 --> 00:03:03,79
 Lord, look upon me in pity, and turn away thine anger

31
00:03:03,79 --> 00:03:09,457
 from this thy people, and suffer not that they

32
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:15,124
 shall go forth across this raging deep in darkness;

33
00:03:15,124 --> 00:03:20,791
 but behold these things which I have molten out of

34
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:26,458
 the rock

35
00:03:26,84 --> 00:03:33,554
4 And I know, O Lord, that thou hast all power,

36
00:03:33,554 --> 00:03:40,268
 and can do whatsoever thou wilt for the benefit of

37
00:03:40,268 --> 00:03:46,982
 man; therefore touch these stones, O Lord, with thy

38
00:03:46,982 --> 00:03:53,696
 finger, and prepare them that they may shine

39
00:03:53,696 --> 00:04:00,41
 forth in darkness; and they shall shine forth unto us

40
00:04:00,41 --> 00:04:07,124
 in the vessels which we have prepared, that we may

41
00:04:07,124 --> 00:04:13,838
 have light while we shall cross the sea

42
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:19,987
5 Behold, O Lord, thou canst do this. We know that

43
00:04:19,987 --> 00:04:25,987
 thou art able to show forth great power, which

44
00:04:25,987 --> 00:04:31,987
 looks small unto the understanding of men

45
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:36,037
6 And it came to pass that when the brother of

46
00:04:36,037 --> 00:04:41,037
 Jared had said these words, behold, the Lord

47
00:04:41,037 --> 00:04:46,037
 stretched forth his hand and touched the stones one by one

48
00:04:46,037 --> 00:04:51,037
 with his finger. And the veil was taken from off

49
00:04:51,037 --> 00:04:56,037
 the eyes of the brother of Jared, and he saw the

50
00:04:56,037 --> 00:05:01,037
 finger of the Lord; and it was as the finger of a

51
00:05:01,037 --> 00:05:06,037
 man, like unto flesh and blood; and the brother of

52
00:05:06,037 --> 00:05:11,037
 Jared fell down before the Lord, for he was struck

53
00:05:11,037 --> 00:05:16,037
 with fear

54
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:21,917
7 And the Lord saw that the brother of Jared had

55
00:05:21,917 --> 00:05:26,917
 fallen to the earth; and the Lord said unto him:

56
00:05:26,917 --> 00:05:31,917
 Arise, why hast thou fallen

57
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:37,332
8 And he saith unto the Lord: I saw the finger of

58
00:05:37,332 --> 00:05:42,999
 the Lord, and I feared lest he should smite me;

59
00:05:42,999 --> 00:05:48,666
 for I knew not that the Lord had flesh and blood

60
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:54,682
9 And the Lord said unto him: Because of thy faith

61
00:05:54,682 --> 00:06:00,682
 thou hast seen that I shall take upon me flesh

62
00:06:00,682 --> 00:06:06,682
 and blood; and never has man come before me with

63
00:06:06,682 --> 00:06:12,682
 such exceeding faith as thou hast; for were it not so

64
00:06:12,682 --> 00:06:18,682
 ye could not have seen my finger. Sawest thou

65
00:06:18,682 --> 00:06:24,682
 more than this

66
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:28,918
10 And he answered: Nay; Lord, show thyself unto

67
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:32,918
 me

68
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:37,393
11 And the Lord said unto him: Believest thou the

69
00:06:37,393 --> 00:06:41,893
 words which I shall speak

70
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:47,068
12 And he answered: Yea, Lord, I know that thou

71
00:06:47,068 --> 00:06:52,401
 speakest the truth, for thou art a God of truth, and

72
00:06:52,401 --> 00:06:57,734
 canst not lie

73
00:06:57,217 --> 00:07:02,617
13 And when he had said these words, behold, the

74
00:07:02,617 --> 00:07:08,017
 Lord showed himself unto him, and said: Because

75
00:07:08,017 --> 00:07:13,417
 thou knowest these things ye are redeemed from the

76
00:07:13,417 --> 00:07:18,817
 fall; therefore ye are brought back into my

77
00:07:18,817 --> 00:07:24,217
 presence; therefore I show myself unto you

78
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:31,911
14 Behold, I am he who was prepared from the

79
00:07:31,911 --> 00:07:38,911
 foundation of the world to redeem my people. Behold, I

80
00:07:38,911 --> 00:07:45,911
 am Jesus Christ. I am the Father and the Son. In

81
00:07:45,911 --> 00:07:52,911
 me shall all mankind have life, and that eternally,

82
00:07:52,911 --> 00:07:59,911
 even they who shall believe on my name; and they

83
00:07:59,911 --> 00:08:06,911
 shall become my sons and my daughters

84
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:14,053
15 And never have I showed myself unto man whom I

85
00:08:14,053 --> 00:08:21,253
 have created, for never has man believed in me as

86
00:08:21,253 --> 00:08:28,453
 thou hast. Seest thou that ye are created after

87
00:08:28,453 --> 00:08:35,653
 mine own image? Yea, even all men were created in

88
00:08:35,653 --> 00:08:42,853
 the beginning after mine own image

89
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:47,655
16 Behold, this body, which ye now behold, is the

90
00:08:47,655 --> 00:08:53,255
 body of my spirit; and man have I created after

91
00:08:53,255 --> 00:08:58,855
 the body of my spirit; and even as I appear unto

92
00:08:58,855 --> 00:09:04,455
 thee to be in the spirit will I appear unto my people

93
00:09:04,455 --> 00:09:10,055
 in the flesh

94
00:09:10,45 --> 00:09:16,283
17 And now, as I, Moroni, said I could not make a

95
00:09:16,283 --> 00:09:22,116
 full account of these things which are written,

96
00:09:22,116 --> 00:09:27,949
 therefore it sufficeth me to say that Jesus showed

97
00:09:27,949 --> 00:09:33,782
 himself unto this man in the spirit, even after the

98
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:39,615
 manner and in the likeness of the same body even

99
00:09:39,615 --> 00:09:45,448
 as he showed himself unto the Nephites

100
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:51,402
18 And he ministered unto him even as he

101
00:09:51,402 --> 00:09:57,152
 ministered unto the Nephites; and all this, that this man

102
00:09:57,152 --> 00:10:02,902
 might know that he was God, because of the many

103
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:08,652
 great works which the Lord had showed unto him

104
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:14,707
19 And because of the knowledge of this man he

105
00:10:14,707 --> 00:10:21,04
 could not be kept from beholding within the veil; and

106
00:10:21,04 --> 00:10:27,373
 he saw the finger of Jesus, which, when he saw,

107
00:10:27,373 --> 00:10:33,706
 he fell with fear; for he knew that it was the

108
00:10:33,706 --> 00:10:40,039
 finger of the Lord; and he had faith no longer, for he

109
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:46,372
 knew, nothing doubting

110
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:52,979
20 Wherefore, having this perfect knowledge of

111
00:10:52,979 --> 00:10:59,646
 God, he could not be kept from within the veil;

112
00:10:59,646 --> 00:11:06,313
 therefore he saw Jesus; and he did minister unto him

113
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:11,58
21 And it came to pass that the Lord said unto the

114
00:11:11,58 --> 00:11:16,294
 brother of Jared: Behold, thou shalt not suffer

115
00:11:16,294 --> 00:11:21,008
 these things which ye have seen and heard to go

116
00:11:21,008 --> 00:11:25,722
 forth unto the world, until the time cometh that I

117
00:11:25,722 --> 00:11:30,436
 shall glorify my name in the flesh; wherefore, ye

118
00:11:30,436 --> 00:11:35,15
 shall treasure up the things which ye have seen and

119
00:11:35,15 --> 00:11:39,864
 heard, and show it to no man

120
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:46,466
22 And behold, when ye shall come unto me, ye

121
00:11:46,466 --> 00:11:52,966
 shall write them and shall seal them up, that no one

122
00:11:52,966 --> 00:11:59,466
 can interpret them; for ye shall write them in a

123
00:11:59,466 --> 00:12:05,966
 language that they cannot be read

124
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:10,592
23 And behold, these two stones will I give unto

125
00:12:10,592 --> 00:12:15,259
 thee, and ye shall seal them up also with the

126
00:12:15,259 --> 00:12:19,926
 things which ye shall write

127
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:25,406
24 For behold, the language which ye shall write I

128
00:12:25,406 --> 00:12:30,906
 have confounded; wherefore I will cause in my own

129
00:12:30,906 --> 00:12:36,406
 due time that these stones shall magnify to the

130
00:12:36,406 --> 00:12:41,906
 eyes of men these things which ye shall write

131
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:47,795
25 And when the Lord had said these words, he

132
00:12:47,795 --> 00:12:53,595
 showed unto the brother of Jared all the inhabitants

133
00:12:53,595 --> 00:12:59,395
 of the earth which had been, and also all that

134
00:12:59,395 --> 00:13:05,195
 would be; and he withheld them not from his sight,

135
00:13:05,195 --> 00:13:10,995
 even unto the ends of the earth

136
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:15,556
26 For he had said unto him in times before, that

137
00:13:15,556 --> 00:13:20,389
 if he would believe in him that he could show unto

138
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:25,222
 him all things—it should be shown unto him;

139
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:30,055
 therefore the Lord could not withhold anything from

140
00:13:30,055 --> 00:13:34,888
 him, for he knew that the Lord could show him all

141
00:13:34,888 --> 00:13:39,721
 things

142
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:45,019
27 And the Lord said unto him: Write these things

143
00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:50,352
 and seal them up; and I will show them in mine own

144
00:13:50,352 --> 00:13:55,685
 due time unto the children of men

145
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,168
28 And it came to pass that the Lord commanded him

146
00:13:57,168 --> 00:13:59,168
 that he should seal up the two stones which he

147
00:13:59,168 --> 00:14:01,168
 had received, and show them not, until the Lord

148
00:14:01,168 --> 00:14:03,168
 should show them unto the children of men.
