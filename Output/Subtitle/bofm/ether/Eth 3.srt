Chapter 3 The brother of Jared sees the finger

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of the Lord as He touches sixteen

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
stones—Christ shows His spirit body to the brother of

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Jared—Those who have a perfect knowledge cannot

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
be kept from within the veil—Interpreters are

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:07:44,
provided to bring the Jaredite record to light. 

7
00:07:44,0 --> 00:07:44,0
1 And it came to pass that the brother of

8
00:07:44,0 --> 00:07:44,0
Jared, (now the number of the vessels

9
00:07:44,0 --> 00:07:44,0
which had been prepared was eight) went forth

10
00:07:44,0 --> 00:07:44,0
unto the mount, which they called the

11
00:07:44,0 --> 00:07:44,0
mount Shelem, because of its exceeding height,

12
00:07:44,0 --> 00:07:44,0
and did molten out of a rock sixteen

13
00:07:44,0 --> 00:07:44,0
small stones; and they were white and clear,

14
00:07:44,0 --> 00:07:44,0
even as transparent glass; and he did carry

15
00:07:44,0 --> 00:07:44,0
them in his hands upon the top of the

16
00:07:44,0 --> 00:11:15,
mount, and cried again unto the Lord, saying:

17
00:11:15,0 --> 00:11:15,0
2 O Lord, thou hast said that we must

18
00:11:15,0 --> 00:11:15,0
be encompassed about by the floods.

19
00:11:15,0 --> 00:11:15,0
Now behold, O Lord, and do not be angry

20
00:11:15,0 --> 00:11:15,0
with thy servant because of his

21
00:11:15,0 --> 00:11:15,0
weakness before thee; for we know that thou

22
00:11:15,0 --> 00:11:15,0
art holy and dwellest in the heavens,

23
00:11:15,0 --> 00:11:15,0
and that we are unworthy before thee;

24
00:11:15,0 --> 00:11:15,0
because of the fall our natures have

25
00:11:15,0 --> 00:11:15,0
become evil continually; nevertheless,

26
00:11:15,0 --> 00:11:15,0
O Lord, thou hast given us a

27
00:11:15,0 --> 00:11:15,0
commandment that we must call upon thee, that

28
00:11:15,0 --> 00:20:24,
from thee we may receive according to our desires.

29
00:20:24,0 --> 00:20:24,0
3 Behold, O Lord, thou hast smitten

30
00:20:24,0 --> 00:20:24,0
us because of our iniquity, and hast

31
00:20:24,0 --> 00:20:24,0
driven us forth, and for these many

32
00:20:24,0 --> 00:20:24,0
years we have been in the wilderness;

33
00:20:24,0 --> 00:20:24,0
nevertheless, thou hast been merciful

34
00:20:24,0 --> 00:20:24,0
unto us. O Lord, look upon me in

35
00:20:24,0 --> 00:20:24,0
pity, and turn away thine anger from this

36
00:20:24,0 --> 00:20:24,0
thy people, and suffer not that they

37
00:20:24,0 --> 00:20:24,0
shall go forth across this raging

38
00:20:24,0 --> 00:20:24,0
deep in darkness; but behold these

39
00:20:24,0 --> 00:22:36,
things which I have molten out of the rock.

40
00:22:36,0 --> 00:22:36,0
4 And I know, O Lord, that thou

41
00:22:36,0 --> 00:22:36,0
hast all power, and can do

42
00:22:36,0 --> 00:22:36,0
whatsoever thou wilt for the benefit of

43
00:22:36,0 --> 00:22:36,0
man; therefore touch these stones, O

44
00:22:36,0 --> 00:22:36,0
Lord, with thy finger, and prepare

45
00:22:36,0 --> 00:22:36,0
them that they may shine forth in

46
00:22:36,0 --> 00:22:36,0
darkness; and they shall shine

47
00:22:36,0 --> 00:22:36,0
forth unto us in the vessels which

48
00:22:36,0 --> 00:22:36,0
we have prepared, that we may have

49
00:22:36,0 --> 00:23:48,
light while we shall cross the sea.

50
00:23:48,0 --> 00:23:48,0
5 Behold, O Lord, thou canst

51
00:23:48,0 --> 00:23:48,0
do this. We know that thou

52
00:23:48,0 --> 00:23:48,0
art able to show forth great

53
00:23:48,0 --> 00:23:48,0
power, which looks small

54
00:23:48,0 --> 00:23:20,
unto the understanding of men.

55
00:23:20,0 --> 00:23:20,0
6 And it came to pass that

56
00:23:20,0 --> 00:23:20,0
when the brother of Jared

57
00:23:20,0 --> 00:23:20,0
had said these words,

58
00:23:20,0 --> 00:23:20,0
behold, the Lord stretched forth

59
00:23:20,0 --> 00:23:20,0
his hand and touched the

60
00:23:20,0 --> 00:23:20,0
stones one by one with his

61
00:23:20,0 --> 00:23:20,0
finger. And the veil was

62
00:23:20,0 --> 00:23:20,0
taken from off the eyes of the

63
00:23:20,0 --> 00:23:20,0
brother of Jared, and he

64
00:23:20,0 --> 00:23:20,0
saw the finger of the Lord;

65
00:23:20,0 --> 00:23:20,0
and it was as the finger of

66
00:23:20,0 --> 00:23:20,0
a man, like unto flesh and

67
00:23:20,0 --> 00:23:20,0
blood; and the brother of

68
00:23:20,0 --> 00:23:20,0
Jared fell down before the

69
00:23:20,0 --> 00:30:28,
Lord, for he was struck with fear.

70
00:30:28,0 --> 00:30:28,0
7 And the Lord saw that

71
00:30:28,0 --> 00:30:28,0
the brother of Jared had

72
00:30:28,0 --> 00:30:28,0
fallen to the earth; and

73
00:30:28,0 --> 00:30:28,0
the Lord said unto him:

74
00:30:28,0 --> 00:36:38,
Arise, why hast thou fallen?

75
00:36:38,0 --> 00:36:38,0
8 And he saith unto the

76
00:36:38,0 --> 00:36:38,0
Lord: I saw the finger

77
00:36:38,0 --> 00:36:38,0
of the Lord, and I feared

78
00:36:38,0 --> 00:36:38,0
lest he should smite

79
00:36:38,0 --> 00:36:38,0
me; for I knew not that

80
00:36:38,0 --> 00:47:18,
the Lord had flesh and blood.

81
00:47:18,0 --> 00:47:18,0
9 And the Lord said

82
00:47:18,0 --> 00:47:18,0
unto him: Because of thy

83
00:47:18,0 --> 00:47:18,0
faith thou hast seen

84
00:47:18,0 --> 00:47:18,0
that I shall take upon me

85
00:47:18,0 --> 00:47:18,0
flesh and blood; and

86
00:47:18,0 --> 00:47:18,0
never has man come before

87
00:47:18,0 --> 00:47:18,0
me with such exceeding

88
00:47:18,0 --> 00:47:18,0
faith as thou hast;

89
00:47:18,0 --> 00:47:18,0
for were it not so ye

90
00:47:18,0 --> 00:47:18,0
could not have seen my

91
00:47:18,0 --> 00:54:26,
finger. Sawest thou more than this?

92
00:54:26,0 --> 00:54:26,0
10 And he

93
00:54:26,0 --> 00:54:26,0
answered: Nay; Lord,

94
00:54:26,0 --> 01:05:33,
show thyself unto me.

95
01:05:33,0 --> 01:05:33,0
11 And the Lord

96
01:05:33,0 --> 01:05:33,0
said unto him:

97
01:05:33,0 --> 01:05:33,0
Believest thou

98
01:05:33,0 --> 01:05:33,0
the words

99
01:05:33,0 --> 01:17:16,
which I shall speak?

100
01:17:16,0 --> 01:17:16,0
12 And he

101
01:17:16,0 --> 01:17:16,0
answered: Yea,

102
01:17:16,0 --> 01:17:16,0
Lord, I know that

103
01:17:16,0 --> 01:17:16,0
thou speakest

104
01:17:16,0 --> 01:17:16,0
the truth,

105
01:17:16,0 --> 01:17:16,0
for thou art a

106
01:17:16,0 --> 01:17:16,0
God of truth,

107
01:17:16,0 --> 01:35:23,
and canst not lie.

108
01:35:23,0 --> 01:35:23,0
13 And when

109
01:35:23,0 --> 01:35:23,0
he had said

110
01:35:23,0 --> 01:35:23,0
these words,

111
01:35:23,0 --> 01:35:23,0
behold, the

112
01:35:23,0 --> 01:35:23,0
Lord showed

113
01:35:23,0 --> 01:35:23,0
himself unto him,

114
01:35:23,0 --> 01:35:23,0
and said:

115
01:35:23,0 --> 01:35:23,0
Because thou

116
01:35:23,0 --> 01:35:23,0
knowest these

117
01:35:23,0 --> 01:35:23,0
things ye are

118
01:35:23,0 --> 01:35:23,0
redeemed from

119
01:35:23,0 --> 01:35:23,0
the fall;

120
01:35:23,0 --> 01:35:23,0
therefore ye

121
01:35:23,0 --> 01:35:23,0
are brought

122
01:35:23,0 --> 01:35:23,0
back into my

123
01:35:23,0 --> 01:35:23,0
presence;

124
01:35:23,0 --> 01:42:53,
therefore I show myself unto you.

125
01:42:53,0 --> 01:42:53,0
14 Behold, I

126
01:42:53,0 --> 01:42:53,0
am he who

127
01:42:53,0 --> 01:42:53,0
was prepared

128
01:42:53,0 --> 01:42:53,0
from the

129
01:42:53,0 --> 01:42:53,0
foundation of

130
01:42:53,0 --> 01:42:53,0
the world to

131
01:42:53,0 --> 01:42:53,0
redeem my

132
01:42:53,0 --> 01:42:53,0
people.

133
01:42:53,0 --> 01:42:53,0
Behold, I am Jesus

134
01:42:53,0 --> 01:42:53,0
Christ. I

135
01:42:53,0 --> 01:42:53,0
am the Father

136
01:42:53,0 --> 01:42:53,0
and the

137
01:42:53,0 --> 01:42:53,0
Son. In me

138
01:42:53,0 --> 01:42:53,0
shall all

139
01:42:53,0 --> 01:42:53,0
mankind have life,

140
01:42:53,0 --> 01:42:53,0
and that

141
01:42:53,0 --> 01:42:53,0
eternally,

142
01:42:53,0 --> 01:42:53,0
even they who

143
01:42:53,0 --> 01:42:53,0
shall believe

144
01:42:53,0 --> 01:42:53,0
on my name;

145
01:42:53,0 --> 01:42:53,0
and they

146
01:42:53,0 --> 01:42:53,0
shall become

147
01:42:53,0 --> 01:57:46,
my sons and my daughters.

148
01:57:46,0 --> 01:57:46,0
15 And

149
01:57:46,0 --> 01:57:46,0
never have I

150
01:57:46,0 --> 01:57:46,0
showed myself

151
01:57:46,0 --> 01:57:46,0
unto man

152
01:57:46,0 --> 01:57:46,0
whom I have

153
01:57:46,0 --> 01:57:46,0
created,

154
01:57:46,0 --> 01:57:46,0
for never has

155
01:57:46,0 --> 01:57:46,0
man

156
01:57:46,0 --> 01:57:46,0
believed in me as

157
01:57:46,0 --> 01:57:46,0
thou hast.

158
01:57:46,0 --> 01:57:46,0
Seest thou

159
01:57:46,0 --> 01:57:46,0
that ye

160
01:57:46,0 --> 01:57:46,0
are created

161
01:57:46,0 --> 01:57:46,0
after mine

162
01:57:46,0 --> 01:57:46,0
own image?

163
01:57:46,0 --> 01:57:46,0
Yea, even

164
01:57:46,0 --> 01:57:46,0
all men were

165
01:57:46,0 --> 01:57:46,0
created in

166
01:57:46,0 --> 01:57:46,0
the

167
01:57:46,0 --> 02:00:56,
beginning after mine own image.

168
02:00:56,0 --> 02:00:56,0
16 Behold,

169
02:00:56,0 --> 02:00:56,0
this

170
02:00:56,0 --> 02:00:56,0
body, which ye

171
02:00:56,0 --> 02:00:56,0
now

172
02:00:56,0 --> 02:00:56,0
behold, is the

173
02:00:56,0 --> 02:00:56,0
body of my

174
02:00:56,0 --> 02:00:56,0
spirit;

175
02:00:56,0 --> 02:00:56,0
and man

176
02:00:56,0 --> 02:00:56,0
have I

177
02:00:56,0 --> 02:00:56,0
created after

178
02:00:56,0 --> 02:00:56,0
the body of

179
02:00:56,0 --> 02:00:56,0
my spirit;

180
02:00:56,0 --> 02:00:56,0
and even

181
02:00:56,0 --> 02:00:56,0
as I

182
02:00:56,0 --> 02:00:56,0
appear unto

183
02:00:56,0 --> 02:00:56,0
thee to be in

184
02:00:56,0 --> 02:00:56,0
the

185
02:00:56,0 --> 02:00:56,0
spirit will I

186
02:00:56,0 --> 02:00:56,0
appear unto

187
02:00:56,0 --> 02:06:07,
my people in the flesh.

188
02:06:07,0 --> 02:06:07,0
17 And

189
02:06:07,0 --> 02:06:07,0
now, as I,

190
02:06:07,0 --> 02:06:07,0
Moroni,

191
02:06:07,0 --> 02:06:07,0
said I

192
02:06:07,0 --> 02:06:07,0
could not

193
02:06:07,0 --> 02:06:07,0
make a full

194
02:06:07,0 --> 02:06:07,0
account

195
02:06:07,0 --> 02:06:07,0
of these

196
02:06:07,0 --> 02:06:07,0
things

197
02:06:07,0 --> 02:06:07,0
which are

198
02:06:07,0 --> 02:06:07,0
written,

199
02:06:07,0 --> 02:06:07,0
therefore

200
02:06:07,0 --> 02:06:07,0
it

201
02:06:07,0 --> 02:06:07,0
sufficeth me to

202
02:06:07,0 --> 02:06:07,0
say that

203
02:06:07,0 --> 02:06:07,0
Jesus

204
02:06:07,0 --> 02:06:07,0
showed

205
02:06:07,0 --> 02:06:07,0
himself unto

206
02:06:07,0 --> 02:06:07,0
this man

207
02:06:07,0 --> 02:06:07,0
in the

208
02:06:07,0 --> 02:06:07,0
spirit,

209
02:06:07,0 --> 02:06:07,0
even after

210
02:06:07,0 --> 02:06:07,0
the manner

211
02:06:07,0 --> 02:06:07,0
and in

212
02:06:07,0 --> 02:06:07,0
the

213
02:06:07,0 --> 02:06:07,0
likeness of the

214
02:06:07,0 --> 02:06:07,0
same

215
02:06:07,0 --> 02:06:07,0
body even as

216
02:06:07,0 --> 02:09:37,
he showed himself unto the Nephites.

217
02:09:37,0 --> 02:09:37,0
18 And

218
02:09:37,0 --> 02:09:37,0
he

219
02:09:37,0 --> 02:09:37,0
ministered

220

02:11:49,0 --> 02:11:49,0
faith no

275
02:15:20,0 --> 02:15:20,0

Wherefore,

277
02:15:20,0 --> 02:15:20,0
having

290
02:15:20,0 --> 02:15:20,0


291
02:15:20,0 --> 02:15:20,0
therefore he

292

did minister unto him.
