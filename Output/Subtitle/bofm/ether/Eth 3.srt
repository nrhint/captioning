Chapter 3 The brother of Jared sees the finger

2
00:00:05,0 --> 00:00:10,0
of the Lord as He touches sixteen

3
00:00:10,0 --> 00:00:15,0
stones—Christ shows His spirit body to the brother of

4
00:00:15,0 --> 00:00:20,0
Jared—Those who have a perfect knowledge cannot

5
00:00:20,0 --> 00:00:25,0
be kept from within the veil—Interpreters are

6
00:00:25,0 --> 00:00:30,23
provided to bring the Jaredite record to light. 

7
00:00:30,23 --> 00:00:31,53
1 And it came to pass that the brother of

8
00:00:31,53 --> 00:00:32,83
Jared, (now the number of the vessels

9
00:00:32,83 --> 00:00:34,13
which had been prepared was eight) went forth

10
00:00:34,13 --> 00:00:35,43
unto the mount, which they called the

11
00:00:35,43 --> 00:00:36,73
mount Shelem, because of its exceeding height,

12
00:00:36,73 --> 00:00:38,03
and did molten out of a rock sixteen

13
00:00:38,03 --> 00:00:39,33
small stones; and they were white and clear,

14
00:00:39,33 --> 00:00:40,63
even as transparent glass; and he did carry

15
00:00:40,63 --> 00:00:41,93
them in his hands upon the top of the

16
00:00:41,93 --> 00:00:43,61
mount, and cried again unto the Lord, saying:

17
00:00:43,61 --> 00:00:44,027
2 O Lord, thou hast said that we must

18
00:00:44,027 --> 00:00:44,444
be encompassed about by the floods.

19
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:44,861
Now behold, O Lord, and do not be angry

20
00:00:44,861 --> 00:00:45,278
with thy servant because of his

21
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:45,695
weakness before thee; for we know that thou

22
00:00:45,695 --> 00:00:46,112
art holy and dwellest in the heavens,

23
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:46,529
and that we are unworthy before thee;

24
00:00:46,529 --> 00:00:46,946
because of the fall our natures have

25
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:47,363
become evil continually; nevertheless,

26
00:00:47,363 --> 00:00:47,78
O Lord, thou hast given us a

27
00:00:47,78 --> 00:00:48,197
commandment that we must call upon thee, that

28
00:00:48,197 --> 00:00:48,015
from thee we may receive according to our desires.

29
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:50,742
3 Behold, O Lord, thou hast smitten

30
00:00:50,742 --> 00:00:53,469
us because of our iniquity, and hast

31
00:00:53,469 --> 00:00:56,196
driven us forth, and for these many

32
00:00:56,196 --> 00:00:58,923
years we have been in the wilderness;

33
00:00:58,923 --> 00:01:01,65
nevertheless, thou hast been merciful

34
00:01:01,65 --> 00:01:04,377
unto us. O Lord, look upon me in

35
00:01:04,377 --> 00:01:07,104
pity, and turn away thine anger from this

36
00:01:07,104 --> 00:01:09,831
thy people, and suffer not that they

37
00:01:09,831 --> 00:01:12,558
shall go forth across this raging

38
00:01:12,558 --> 00:01:15,285
deep in darkness; but behold these

39
00:01:15,285 --> 00:01:18,245
things which I have molten out of the rock.

40
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:20,045
4 And I know, O Lord, that thou

41
00:01:20,045 --> 00:01:21,845
hast all power, and can do

42
00:01:21,845 --> 00:01:23,645
whatsoever thou wilt for the benefit of

43
00:01:23,645 --> 00:01:25,445
man; therefore touch these stones, O

44
00:01:25,445 --> 00:01:27,245
Lord, with thy finger, and prepare

45
00:01:27,245 --> 00:01:29,045
them that they may shine forth in

46
00:01:29,045 --> 00:01:30,845
darkness; and they shall shine

47
00:01:30,845 --> 00:01:32,645
forth unto us in the vessels which

48
00:01:32,645 --> 00:01:34,445
we have prepared, that we may have

49
00:01:34,445 --> 00:01:36,597
light while we shall cross the sea.

50
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:51,797
5 Behold, O Lord, thou canst

51
00:01:51,797 --> 00:02:06,996
do this. We know that thou

52
00:02:06,996 --> 00:02:22,197
art able to show forth great

53
00:02:22,197 --> 00:02:37,397
power, which looks small

54
00:02:37,397 --> 00:02:52,739
unto the understanding of men.

55
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:53,672
6 And it came to pass that

56
00:02:53,672 --> 00:02:54,605
when the brother of Jared

57
00:02:54,605 --> 00:02:55,538
had said these words,

58
00:02:55,538 --> 00:02:56,471
behold, the Lord stretched forth

59
00:02:56,471 --> 00:02:57,404
his hand and touched the

60
00:02:57,404 --> 00:02:58,337
stones one by one with his

61
00:02:58,337 --> 00:02:59,27
finger. And the veil was

62
00:02:59,27 --> 00:03:00,203
taken from off the eyes of the

63
00:03:00,203 --> 00:03:01,136
brother of Jared, and he

64
00:03:01,136 --> 00:03:02,069
saw the finger of the Lord;

65
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:03,002
and it was as the finger of

66
00:03:03,002 --> 00:03:03,935
a man, like unto flesh and

67
00:03:03,935 --> 00:03:04,868
blood; and the brother of

68
00:03:04,868 --> 00:03:05,801
Jared fell down before the

69
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:06,553
Lord, for he was struck with fear.

70
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:19,153
7 And the Lord saw that

71
00:03:19,153 --> 00:03:31,753
the brother of Jared had

72
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:44,353
fallen to the earth; and

73
00:03:44,353 --> 00:03:56,953
the Lord said unto him:

74
00:03:56,953 --> 00:04:09,382
Arise, why hast thou fallen?

75
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:09,215
8 And he saith unto the

76
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:09,048
Lord: I saw the finger

77
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:08,881
of the Lord, and I feared

78
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:08,714
lest he should smite

79
00:04:08,714 --> 00:04:08,547
me; for I knew not that

80
00:04:08,547 --> 00:04:08,448
the Lord had flesh and blood.

81
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:08,63
9 And the Lord said

82
00:04:08,63 --> 00:04:08,812
unto him: Because of thy

83
00:04:08,812 --> 00:04:08,994
faith thou hast seen

84
00:04:08,994 --> 00:04:09,176
that I shall take upon me

85
00:04:09,176 --> 00:04:09,358
flesh and blood; and

86
00:04:09,358 --> 00:04:09,54
never has man come before

87
00:04:09,54 --> 00:04:09,722
me with such exceeding

88
00:04:09,722 --> 00:04:09,904
faith as thou hast;

89
00:04:09,904 --> 00:04:10,086
for were it not so ye

90
00:04:10,086 --> 00:04:10,268
could not have seen my

91
00:04:10,268 --> 00:04:10,851
finger. Sawest thou more than this?

92
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:13,518
10 And he

93
00:04:13,518 --> 00:04:16,185
answered: Nay; Lord,

94
00:04:16,185 --> 00:04:18,792
show thyself unto me.

95
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:20,992
11 And the Lord

96
00:04:20,992 --> 00:04:23,192
said unto him:

97
00:04:23,192 --> 00:04:25,392
Believest thou

98
00:04:25,392 --> 00:04:27,592
the words

99
00:04:27,592 --> 00:04:29,136
which I shall speak?

100
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:31,636
12 And he

101
00:04:31,636 --> 00:04:34,136
answered: Yea,

102
00:04:34,136 --> 00:04:36,636
Lord, I know that

103
00:04:36,636 --> 00:04:39,136
thou speakest

104
00:04:39,136 --> 00:04:41,636
the truth,

105
00:04:41,636 --> 00:04:44,136
for thou art a

106
00:04:44,136 --> 00:04:46,636
God of truth,

107
00:04:46,636 --> 00:04:49,456
and canst not lie.

108
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:50,044
13 And when

109
00:04:50,044 --> 00:04:50,632
he had said

110
00:04:50,632 --> 00:04:51,22
these words,

111
00:04:51,22 --> 00:04:51,808
behold, the

112
00:04:51,808 --> 00:04:52,396
Lord showed

113
00:04:52,396 --> 00:04:52,984
himself unto him,

114
00:04:52,984 --> 00:04:53,572
and said:

115
00:04:53,572 --> 00:04:54,16
Because thou

116
00:04:54,16 --> 00:04:54,748
knowest these

117
00:04:54,748 --> 00:04:55,336
things ye are

118
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:55,924
redeemed from

119
00:04:55,924 --> 00:04:56,512
the fall;

120
00:04:56,512 --> 00:04:57,1
therefore ye

121
00:04:57,1 --> 00:04:57,688
are brought

122
00:04:57,688 --> 00:04:58,276
back into my

123
00:04:58,276 --> 00:04:58,864
presence;

124
00:04:58,864 --> 00:04:59,833
therefore I show myself unto you.

125
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:00,224
14 Behold, I

126
00:05:00,224 --> 00:05:00,615
am he who

127
00:05:00,615 --> 00:05:01,006
was prepared

128
00:05:01,006 --> 00:05:01,397
from the

129
00:05:01,397 --> 00:05:01,788
foundation of

130
00:05:01,788 --> 00:05:02,179
the world to

131
00:05:02,179 --> 00:05:02,57
redeem my

132
00:05:02,57 --> 00:05:02,961
people.

133
00:05:02,961 --> 00:05:03,352
Behold, I am Jesus

134
00:05:03,352 --> 00:05:03,743
Christ. I

135
00:05:03,743 --> 00:05:04,134
am the Father

136
00:05:04,134 --> 00:05:04,525
and the

137
00:05:04,525 --> 00:05:04,916
Son. In me

138
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:05,307
shall all

139
00:05:05,307 --> 00:05:05,698
mankind have life,

140
00:05:05,698 --> 00:05:06,089
and that

141
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:06,48
eternally,

142
00:05:06,48 --> 00:05:06,871
even they who

143
00:05:06,871 --> 00:05:07,262
shall believe

144
00:05:07,262 --> 00:05:07,653
on my name;

145
00:05:07,653 --> 00:05:08,044
and they

146
00:05:08,044 --> 00:05:08,435
shall become

147
00:05:08,435 --> 00:05:08,275
my sons and my daughters.

148
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:08,675
15 And

149
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:09,075
never have I

150
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:09,475
showed myself

151
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:09,875
unto man

152
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:10,275
whom I have

153
00:05:10,275 --> 00:05:10,675
created,

154
00:05:10,675 --> 00:05:11,075
for never has

155
00:05:11,075 --> 00:05:11,475
man

156
00:05:11,475 --> 00:05:11,875
believed in me as

157
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:12,275
thou hast.

158
00:05:12,275 --> 00:05:12,675
Seest thou

159
00:05:12,675 --> 00:05:13,075
that ye

160
00:05:13,075 --> 00:05:13,475
are created

161
00:05:13,475 --> 00:05:13,875
after mine

162
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:14,275
own image?

163
00:05:14,275 --> 00:05:14,675
Yea, even

164
00:05:14,675 --> 00:05:15,075
all men were

165
00:05:15,075 --> 00:05:15,475
created in

166
00:05:15,475 --> 00:05:15,875
the

167
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:16,716
beginning after mine own image.

168
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:17,416
16 Behold,

169
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:18,116
this

170
00:05:18,116 --> 00:05:18,816
body, which ye

171
00:05:18,816 --> 00:05:19,516
now

172
00:05:19,516 --> 00:05:20,216
behold, is the

173
00:05:20,216 --> 00:05:20,916
body of my

174
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:21,616
spirit;

175
00:05:21,616 --> 00:05:22,316
and man

176
00:05:22,316 --> 00:05:23,016
have I

177
00:05:23,016 --> 00:05:23,716
created after

178
00:05:23,716 --> 00:05:24,416
the body of

179
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:25,116
my spirit;

180
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:25,816
and even

181
00:05:25,816 --> 00:05:26,516
as I

182
00:05:26,516 --> 00:05:27,216
appear unto

183
00:05:27,216 --> 00:05:27,916
thee to be in

184
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:28,616
the

185
00:05:28,616 --> 00:05:29,316
spirit will I

186
00:05:29,316 --> 00:05:30,016
appear unto

187
00:05:30,016 --> 00:05:30,997
my people in the flesh.

188
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:31,549
17 And

189
00:05:31,549 --> 00:05:32,101
now, as I,

190
00:05:32,101 --> 00:05:32,653
Moroni,

191
00:05:32,653 --> 00:05:33,205
said I

192
00:05:33,205 --> 00:05:33,757
could not

193
00:05:33,757 --> 00:05:34,309
make a full

194
00:05:34,309 --> 00:05:34,861
account

195
00:05:34,861 --> 00:05:35,413
of these

196
00:05:35,413 --> 00:05:35,965
things

197
00:05:35,965 --> 00:05:36,517
which are

198
00:05:36,517 --> 00:05:37,069
written,

199
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:37,621
therefore

200
00:05:37,621 --> 00:05:38,173
it

201
00:05:38,173 --> 00:05:38,725
sufficeth me to

202
00:05:38,725 --> 00:05:39,277
say that

203
00:05:39,277 --> 00:05:39,829
Jesus

204
00:05:39,829 --> 00:05:40,381
showed

205
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:40,933
himself unto

206
00:05:40,933 --> 00:05:41,485
this man

207
00:05:41,485 --> 00:05:42,037
in the

208
00:05:42,037 --> 00:05:42,589
spirit,

209
00:05:42,589 --> 00:05:43,141
even after

210
00:05:43,141 --> 00:05:43,693
the manner

211
00:05:43,693 --> 00:05:44,245
and in

212
00:05:44,245 --> 00:05:44,797
the

213
00:05:44,797 --> 00:05:45,349
likeness of the

214
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:45,901
same

215
00:05:45,901 --> 00:05:46,453
body even as

216
00:05:46,453 --> 00:05:46,012
he showed himself unto the Nephites.

217
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,694
18 And

218
00:05:47,694 --> 00:05:49,376
he

219
00:05:49,376 --> 00:05:51,058
ministered

220
00:05:51,058 --> 00:05:52,74
unto him

221
00:05:52,74 --> 00:05:54,422
even as he

222
00:05:54,422 --> 00:05:56,104


223
00:05:56,104 --> 00:05:57,786
ministered unto

224
00:05:57,786 --> 00:05:59,468
the

225
00:05:59,468 --> 00:06:01,15
Nephites;

226
00:06:01,15 --> 00:06:02,832
and all

227
00:06:02,832 --> 00:06:04,514
this,

228
00:06:04,514 --> 00:06:06,196
that this

229
00:06:06,196 --> 00:06:07,878
man might

230
00:06:07,878 --> 00:06:09,56
know

231
00:06:09,56 --> 00:06:11,242
that he

232
00:06:11,242 --> 00:06:12,924
was God,

233
00:06:12,924 --> 00:06:14,606
because

234
00:06:14,606 --> 00:06:16,288
of the

235
00:06:16,288 --> 00:06:17,97
many great

236
00:06:17,97 --> 00:06:19,652
works

237
00:06:19,652 --> 00:06:21,334
which the

238
00:06:21,334 --> 00:06:23,783
Lord had showed unto him.

239
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:23,926
19 And

240
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:24,069
because

241
00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:24,212
of the

242
00:06:24,212 --> 00:06:24,355


243
00:06:24,355 --> 00:06:24,498
knowledge of

244
00:06:24,498 --> 00:06:24,641
this

245
00:06:24,641 --> 00:06:24,784
man he

246
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:24,927
could not

247
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:25,07
be

248
00:06:25,07 --> 00:06:25,213
kept from

249
00:06:25,213 --> 00:06:25,356


250
00:06:25,356 --> 00:06:25,499
beholding

251
00:06:25,499 --> 00:06:25,642
within the

252
00:06:25,642 --> 00:06:25,785
veil;

253
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:25,928
and he

254
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:26,071
saw the

255
00:06:26,071 --> 00:06:26,214
finger

256
00:06:26,214 --> 00:06:26,357
of

257
00:06:26,357 --> 00:06:26,5
Jesus,

258
00:06:26,5 --> 00:06:26,643
which, when

259
00:06:26,643 --> 00:06:26,786
he

260
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:26,929
saw, he

261
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:27,072
fell with

262
00:06:27,072 --> 00:06:27,215
fear;

263
00:06:27,215 --> 00:06:27,358
for he

264
00:06:27,358 --> 00:06:27,501
knew

265
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:27,644
that it

266
00:06:27,644 --> 00:06:27,787
was the

267
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:27,93
finger

268
00:06:27,93 --> 00:06:28,073
of the

269
00:06:28,073 --> 00:06:28,216
Lord;

270
00:06:28,216 --> 00:06:28,359
and he

271
00:06:28,359 --> 00:06:28,502
had

272
00:06:28,502 --> 00:06:28,645
faith no

273
00:06:28,645 --> 00:06:28,188
longer, for he knew, nothing doubting.

274
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:28,143
20

275
00:06:28,143 --> 00:06:28,098


276
00:06:28,098 --> 00:06:28,053
Wherefore,

277
00:06:28,053 --> 00:06:28,008
having

278
00:06:28,008 --> 00:06:27,963
this

279
00:06:27,963 --> 00:06:27,918
perfect

280
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:27,873


281
00:06:27,873 --> 00:06:27,828
knowledge of

282
00:06:27,828 --> 00:06:27,783
God, he

283
00:06:27,783 --> 00:06:27,738
could

284
00:06:27,738 --> 00:06:27,693
not

285
00:06:27,693 --> 00:06:27,648
be kept

286
00:06:27,648 --> 00:06:27,603

291
00:06:27,423 --> 00:06:27,378
therefore he

292
00:06:27,378 --> 00:06:27,333
saw

293
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:27,288

294
00:06:27,288 --> 00:06:27,243
and he

295
00:06:27,243 --> 00:06:27,254
did minister unto him.

296
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:27,236

297
00:06:27,236 --> 00:06:27,218
