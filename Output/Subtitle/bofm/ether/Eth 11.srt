00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,75
Chapter 11 Wars, dissensions, and wickedness

2
00:00:01,75 --> 00:00:03,5
 dominate Jaredite life—Prophets predict the utter

3
00:00:03,5 --> 00:00:05,25
 destruction of the Jaredites unless they repent—The

4
00:00:05,25 --> 00:00:07,0
 people reject the words of the prophets.

5
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,575
1 And there came also in the days of Com many

6
00:00:09,575 --> 00:00:11,175
 prophets, and prophesied of the destruction of that

7
00:00:11,175 --> 00:00:12,775
 great people except they should repent, and turn

8
00:00:12,775 --> 00:00:14,375
 unto the Lord, and forsake their murders and

9
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:15,975
 wickedness

10
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,616
2 And it came to pass that the prophets were

11
00:00:18,616 --> 00:00:21,283
 rejected by the people, and they fled unto Com for

12
00:00:21,283 --> 00:00:23,95
 protection, for the people sought to destroy them

13
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:27,924
3 And they prophesied unto Com many things; and he

14
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:31,924
 was blessed in all the remainder of his days

15
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,899
4 And he lived to a good old age, and begat

16
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,899
 Shiblom; and Shiblom reigned in his stead. And the

17
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:37,899
 brother of Shiblom rebelled against him, and there

18
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:39,899
 began to be an exceedingly great war in all the land

19
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,873
5 And it came to pass that the brother of Shiblom

20
00:00:41,873 --> 00:00:43,873
 caused that all the prophets who prophesied of the

21
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:45,873
 destruction of the people should be put to death

22
00:00:45,873 --> 00:00:47,873


23
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:48,848
6 And there was great calamity in all the land,

24
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:49,848
 for they had testified that a great curse should

25
00:00:49,848 --> 00:00:50,848
 come upon the land, and also upon the people, and

26
00:00:50,848 --> 00:00:51,848
 that there should be a great destruction among them,

27
00:00:51,848 --> 00:00:52,848
 such an one as never had been upon the face of the

28
00:00:52,848 --> 00:00:53,848
 earth, and their bones should become as heaps of

29
00:00:53,848 --> 00:00:54,848
 earth upon the face of the land except they should

30
00:00:54,848 --> 00:00:55,848
 repent of their wickedness

31
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,822
7 And they hearkened not unto the voice of the

32
00:00:57,822 --> 00:00:59,822
 Lord, because of their wicked combinations;

33
00:00:59,822 --> 00:01:01,822
 wherefore, there began to be wars and contentions in all

34
00:01:01,822 --> 00:01:03,822
 the land, and also many famines and pestilences,

35
00:01:03,822 --> 00:01:05,822
 insomuch that there was a great destruction, such an

36
00:01:05,822 --> 00:01:07,822
 one as never had been known upon the face of the

37
00:01:07,822 --> 00:01:09,822
 earth; and all this came to pass in the days of

38
00:01:09,822 --> 00:01:11,822
 Shiblom

39
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:14,439
8 And the people began to repent of their

40
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:17,106
 iniquity; and inasmuch as they did the Lord did have mercy

41
00:01:17,106 --> 00:01:19,773
 on them

42
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:25,079
9 And it came to pass that Shiblom was slain, and

43
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:30,412
 Seth was brought into captivity, and did dwell in

44
00:01:30,412 --> 00:01:35,745
 captivity all his days

45
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,296
10 And it came to pass that Ahah, his son, did

46
00:01:37,296 --> 00:01:38,896
 obtain the kingdom; and he did reign over the people

47
00:01:38,896 --> 00:01:40,496
 all his days. And he did do all manner of iniquity

48
00:01:40,496 --> 00:01:42,096
 in his days, by which he did cause the shedding

49
00:01:42,096 --> 00:01:43,696
 of much blood; and few were his days

50
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:46,337
11 And Ethem, being a descendant of Ahah, did

51
00:01:46,337 --> 00:01:49,004
 obtain the kingdom; and he also did do that which was

52
00:01:49,004 --> 00:01:51,671
 wicked in his days

53
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:53,245
12 And it came to pass that in the days of Ethem

54
00:01:53,245 --> 00:01:54,845
 there came many prophets, and prophesied again unto

55
00:01:54,845 --> 00:01:56,445
 the people; yea, they did prophesy that the Lord

56
00:01:56,445 --> 00:01:58,045
 would utterly destroy them from off the face of

57
00:01:58,045 --> 00:01:59,645
 the earth except they repented of their iniquities

58
00:01:59,62 --> 00:02:01,62
13 And it came to pass that the people hardened

59
00:02:01,62 --> 00:02:03,62
 their hearts, and would not hearken unto their

60
00:02:03,62 --> 00:02:05,62
 words; and the prophets mourned and withdrew from among

61
00:02:05,62 --> 00:02:07,62
 the people

62
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,194
14 And it came to pass that Ethem did execute

63
00:02:09,194 --> 00:02:10,794
 judgment in wickedness all his days; and he begat

64
00:02:10,794 --> 00:02:12,394
 Moron. And it came to pass that Moron did reign in his

65
00:02:12,394 --> 00:02:13,994
 stead; and Moron did that which was wicked before

66
00:02:13,994 --> 00:02:15,594
 the Lord

67
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:16,712
15 And it came to pass that there arose a

68
00:02:16,712 --> 00:02:17,855
 rebellion among the people, because of that secret

69
00:02:17,855 --> 00:02:18,998
 combination which was built up to get power and gain; and

70
00:02:18,998 --> 00:02:20,141
 there arose a mighty man among them in iniquity,

71
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:21,284
 and gave battle unto Moron, in which he did

72
00:02:21,284 --> 00:02:22,427
 overthrow the half of the kingdom; and he did maintain

73
00:02:22,427 --> 00:02:23,57
 the half of the kingdom for many years

74
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:31,543
16 And it came to pass that Moron did overthrow

75
00:02:31,543 --> 00:02:39,543
 him, and did obtain the kingdom again

76
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:42,16
17 And it came to pass that there arose another

77
00:02:42,16 --> 00:02:44,827
 mighty man; and he was a descendant of the brother

78
00:02:44,827 --> 00:02:47,494
 of Jared

79
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,467
18 And it came to pass that he did overthrow Moron

80
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:51,467
 and obtain the kingdom; wherefore, Moron dwelt in

81
00:02:51,467 --> 00:02:53,467
 captivity all the remainder of his days; and he

82
00:02:53,467 --> 00:02:55,467
 begat Coriantor

83
00:02:55,442 --> 00:03:03,442
19 And it came to pass that Coriantor dwelt in

84
00:03:03,442 --> 00:03:11,442
 captivity all his days

85
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:14,058
20 And in the days of Coriantor there also came

86
00:03:14,058 --> 00:03:16,725
 many prophets, and prophesied of great and marvelous

87
00:03:16,725 --> 00:03:19,392
 things, and cried repentance unto the people, and

88
00:03:19,392 --> 00:03:22,059
 except they should repent the Lord God would

89
00:03:22,059 --> 00:03:24,726
 execute judgment against them to their utter

90
00:03:24,726 --> 00:03:27,393
 destruction

91
00:03:27,34 --> 00:03:29,34
21 And that the Lord God would send or bring forth

92
00:03:29,34 --> 00:03:31,34
 another people to possess the land, by his power,

93
00:03:31,34 --> 00:03:33,34
 after the manner by which he brought their

94
00:03:33,34 --> 00:03:35,34
 fathers

95
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,982
22 And they did reject all the words of the

96
00:03:37,982 --> 00:03:40,649
 prophets, because of their secret society and wicked

97
00:03:40,649 --> 00:03:43,316
 abominations

98
00:03:43,29 --> 00:03:43,623
23 And it came to pass that Coriantor begat Ether,

99
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:43,956
 and he died, having dwelt in captivity all his

100
00:03:43,956 --> 00:03:44,289
 days.
