Chapter 11 Wars, dissensions, and wickedness

2
00:00:08,0 --> 00:00:16,0
dominate Jaredite life—Prophets predict the utter

3
00:00:16,0 --> 00:00:24,0
destruction of the Jaredites unless they

4
00:00:24,0 --> 00:00:32,366
repent—The people reject the words of the prophets. 

5
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:33,166
1 And there came also in the days of Com

6
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:33,966
many prophets, and prophesied of the

7
00:00:33,966 --> 00:00:34,766
destruction of that great people except

8
00:00:34,766 --> 00:00:35,566
they should repent, and turn unto the

9
00:00:35,566 --> 00:00:36,77
Lord, and forsake their murders and wickedness.

10
00:00:36,77 --> 00:00:39,52
2 And it came to pass that the

11
00:00:39,52 --> 00:00:42,27
prophets were rejected by the people, and

12
00:00:42,27 --> 00:00:45,02
they fled unto Com for protection,

13
00:00:45,02 --> 00:00:47,114
for the people sought to destroy them.

14
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:48,447
3 And they prophesied unto Com

15
00:00:48,447 --> 00:00:49,78
many things; and he was blessed

16
00:00:49,78 --> 00:00:51,518
in all the remainder of his days.

17
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:52,375
4 And he lived to a good old

18
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:53,232
age, and begat Shiblom; and

19
00:00:53,232 --> 00:00:54,089
Shiblom reigned in his

20
00:00:54,089 --> 00:00:54,946
stead. And the brother of

21
00:00:54,946 --> 00:00:55,803
Shiblom rebelled against him, and

22
00:00:55,803 --> 00:00:56,66
there began to be an

23
00:00:56,66 --> 00:00:57,391
exceedingly great war in all the land.

24
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:58,724
5 And it came to pass

25
00:00:58,724 --> 00:01:00,057
that the brother of Shiblom

26
00:01:00,057 --> 00:01:01,39
caused that all the

27
00:01:01,39 --> 00:01:02,723
prophets who prophesied of the

28
00:01:02,723 --> 00:01:04,056
destruction of the

29
00:01:04,056 --> 00:01:05,832
people should be put to death;

30
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:06,332
6 And there was great

31
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:06,832
calamity in all the

32
00:01:06,832 --> 00:01:07,332
land, for they had

33
00:01:07,332 --> 00:01:07,832
testified that a great curse

34
00:01:07,832 --> 00:01:08,332
should come upon the

35
00:01:08,332 --> 00:01:08,832
land, and also upon the

36
00:01:08,832 --> 00:01:09,332
people, and that there

37
00:01:09,332 --> 00:01:09,832
should be a great

38
00:01:09,832 --> 00:01:10,332
destruction among them, such an

39
00:01:10,332 --> 00:01:10,832
one as never had been

40
00:01:10,832 --> 00:01:11,332
upon the face of the

41
00:01:11,332 --> 00:01:11,832
earth, and their bones

42
00:01:11,832 --> 00:01:12,332
should become as heaps of

43
00:01:12,332 --> 00:01:12,832
earth upon the face of

44
00:01:12,832 --> 00:01:13,332
the land except they

45
00:01:13,332 --> 00:01:13,807
should repent of their wickedness.

46
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
7 And they hearkened

47
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
not unto the voice of

48
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
the Lord, because of

49
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
their wicked

50
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
combinations; wherefore, there

51
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
began to be wars and

52
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
contentions in all the

53
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
land, and also many

54
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
famines and pestilences,

55
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
insomuch that there was

56
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
a great destruction,

57
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
such an one as never

58
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
had been known upon the

59
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
face of the earth;

60
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
and all this came to

61
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
pass in the days of Shiblom.

62
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
8 And the people

63
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
began to repent of their

64
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
iniquity; and

65
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
inasmuch as they did the

66
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
Lord did have mercy on them.

67
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
9 And it came to

68
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
pass that Shiblom was

69
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
slain, and Seth was

70
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
brought into

71
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
captivity, and did dwell in

72
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
captivity all his days.

73
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
10 And it came to

74
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
pass that Ahah, his

75
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
son, did obtain the

76
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
kingdom; and he

77
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
did reign over the

78
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
people all his days.

79
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
And he did do all

80
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
manner of iniquity

81
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
in his days, by

82
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
which he did cause the

83
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
shedding of much

84
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
blood; and few were his days.

85
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
11 And Ethem,

86
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
being a descendant

87
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
of Ahah, did

88
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
obtain the kingdom;

89
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
and he also did do

90
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
that which was

91
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
wicked in his days.

92
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
12 And it came

93
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
to pass that in

94
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
the days of Ethem

95
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
there came many

96
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
prophets, and

97
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
prophesied again

98
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
unto the people;

99
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
yea, they did

100
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
prophesy that the

101
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
Lord would

102
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
utterly destroy them

103
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
from off the

104
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
face of the earth

105
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
except they

106
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
repented of their iniquities.

107
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
13 And it came

108
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
to pass that

109
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
the people

110
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
hardened their

111
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
hearts, and

112
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
would not hearken

113
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
unto their

114
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
words; and the

115
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
prophets mourned

116
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
and withdrew

117
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
from among the people.

118
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
14 And it came

119
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
to pass that

120
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
Ethem did

121
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
execute judgment

122
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
in wickedness

123
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
all his days;

124
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
and he begat

125
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
Moron. And it

126
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
came to pass

127
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
that Moron did

128
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
reign in his

129
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
stead; and Moron

130
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
did that which

131
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
was wicked

132
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
before the Lord.

133
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
15 And it

134
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
came to pass

135
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
that there arose

136
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
a rebellion

137
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
among the

138
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
people, because

139
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
of that

140
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
secret combination

141
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
which was

142
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
built up to get

143
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
power and

144
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
gain; and there

145
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
arose a

146
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
mighty man among

147
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
them in

148
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
iniquity, and gave

149
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
battle unto

150
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
Moron, in

151
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
which he did

152
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
overthrow the

153
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
half of the

154
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
kingdom; and he

155
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
did maintain

156
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
the half of

157
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
the kingdom for many years.

158
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
16 And it

159
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
came to pass

160
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
that Moron

161
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
did overthrow

162
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
him, and did

163
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
obtain the

164
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
kingdom again.

165
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
17 And it

166
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
came to pass

167
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
that there

168
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
arose another

169
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
mighty man;

170
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
and he was a

171
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
descendant

172
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
of the

173
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
brother of Jared.

174
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
18 And it

175
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
came to pass

176
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
that he

177
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
did overthrow

178
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
Moron and

179
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
obtain the

180
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
kingdom;

181
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
wherefore,

182
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
Moron dwelt

183
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
in captivity

184
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
all the

185
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
remainder of

186
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
his days;

187
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
and he begat Coriantor.

188
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
19 And it

189
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
came to

190
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
pass that

191
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
Coriantor

192
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
dwelt in

193
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
captivity all

194
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
his days.

195
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
20 And in

196
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
the days

197
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
of

198
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
Coriantor

199
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
there also

200
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
came many

201
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:13,807
