00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 11 Wars, dissensions, and wickedness

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
dominate Jaredite lifeâ€”Prophets predict the utter

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
destruction of the Jaredites unless they

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:18:08,
repentâ€”The people reject the words of the prophets. 

5
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
1 And there came also in the days of Com

6
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
many prophets, and prophesied of the

7
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
destruction of that great people except

8
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
they should repent, and turn unto the

9
00:18:08,0 --> 00:19:20,
Lord, and forsake their murders and wickedness.

10
00:19:20,0 --> 00:19:20,0
2 And it came to pass that the

11
00:19:20,0 --> 00:19:20,0
prophets were rejected by the people, and

12
00:19:20,0 --> 00:19:20,0
they fled unto Com for protection,

13
00:19:20,0 --> 00:26:14,
for the people sought to destroy them.

14
00:26:14,0 --> 00:26:14,0
3 And they prophesied unto Com

15
00:26:14,0 --> 00:26:14,0
many things; and he was blessed

16
00:26:14,0 --> 00:32:24,
in all the remainder of his days.

17
00:32:24,0 --> 00:32:24,0
4 And he lived to a good old

18
00:32:24,0 --> 00:32:24,0
age, and begat Shiblom; and

19
00:32:24,0 --> 00:32:24,0
Shiblom reigned in his

20
00:32:24,0 --> 00:32:24,0
stead. And the brother of

21
00:32:24,0 --> 00:32:24,0
Shiblom rebelled against him, and

22
00:32:24,0 --> 00:32:24,0
there began to be an

23
00:32:24,0 --> 00:40:36,
exceedingly great war in all the land.

24
00:40:36,0 --> 00:40:36,0
5 And it came to pass

25
00:40:36,0 --> 00:40:36,0
that the brother of Shiblom

26
00:40:36,0 --> 00:40:36,0
caused that all the

27
00:40:36,0 --> 00:40:36,0
prophets who prophesied of the

28
00:40:36,0 --> 00:40:36,0
destruction of the

29
00:40:36,0 --> 00:46:46,
people should be put to death;

30
00:46:46,0 --> 00:46:46,0
6 And there was great

31
00:46:46,0 --> 00:46:46,0
calamity in all the

32
00:46:46,0 --> 00:46:46,0
land, for they had

33
00:46:46,0 --> 00:46:46,0
testified that a great curse

34
00:46:46,0 --> 00:46:46,0
should come upon the

35
00:46:46,0 --> 00:46:46,0
land, and also upon the

36
00:46:46,0 --> 00:46:46,0
people, and that there

37
00:46:46,0 --> 00:46:46,0
should be a great

38
00:46:46,0 --> 00:46:46,0
destruction among them, such an

39
00:46:46,0 --> 00:46:46,0
one as never had been

40
00:46:46,0 --> 00:46:46,0
upon the face of the

41
00:46:46,0 --> 00:46:46,0
earth, and their bones

42
00:46:46,0 --> 00:46:46,0
should become as heaps of

43
00:46:46,0 --> 00:46:46,0
earth upon the face of

44
00:46:46,0 --> 00:46:46,0
the land except they

45
00:46:46,0 --> 00:57:53,
should repent of their wickedness.

46
00:57:53,0 --> 00:57:53,0
7 And they hearkened

47
00:57:53,0 --> 00:57:53,0
not unto the voice of

48
00:57:53,0 --> 00:57:53,0
the Lord, because of

49
00:57:53,0 --> 00:57:53,0
their wicked

50
00:57:53,0 --> 00:57:53,0
combinations; wherefore, there

51
00:57:53,0 --> 00:57:53,0
began to be wars and

52
00:57:53,0 --> 00:57:53,0
contentions in all the

53
00:57:53,0 --> 00:57:53,0
land, and also many

54
00:57:53,0 --> 00:57:53,0
famines and pestilences,

55
00:57:53,0 --> 00:57:53,0
insomuch that there was

56
00:57:53,0 --> 00:57:53,0
a great destruction,

57
00:57:53,0 --> 00:57:53,0
such an one as never

58
00:57:53,0 --> 00:57:53,0
had been known upon the

59
00:57:53,0 --> 00:57:53,0
face of the earth;

60
00:57:53,0 --> 00:57:53,0
and all this came to

61
00:57:53,0 --> 01:01:24,
pass in the days of Shiblom.

62
01:01:24,0 --> 01:01:24,0
8 And the people

63
01:01:24,0 --> 01:01:24,0
began to repent of their

64
01:01:24,0 --> 01:01:24,0
iniquity; and

65
01:01:24,0 --> 01:01:24,0
inasmuch as they did the

66
01:01:24,0 --> 01:11:34,
Lord did have mercy on them.

67
01:11:34,0 --> 01:11:34,0
9 And it came to

68
01:11:34,0 --> 01:11:34,0
pass that Shiblom was

69
01:11:34,0 --> 01:11:34,0
slain, and Seth was

70
01:11:34,0 --> 01:11:34,0
brought into

71
01:11:34,0 --> 01:11:34,0
captivity, and did dwell in

72
01:11:34,0 --> 01:13:46,
captivity all his days.

73
01:13:46,0 --> 01:13:46,0
10 And it came to

74
01:13:46,0 --> 01:13:46,0
pass that Ahah, his

75
01:13:46,0 --> 01:13:46,0
son, did obtain the

76
01:13:46,0 --> 01:13:46,0
kingdom; and he

77
01:13:46,0 --> 01:13:46,0
did reign over the

78
01:13:46,0 --> 01:13:46,0
people all his days.

79
01:13:46,0 --> 01:13:46,0
And he did do all

80
01:13:46,0 --> 01:13:46,0
manner of iniquity

81
01:13:46,0 --> 01:13:46,0
in his days, by

82
01:13:46,0 --> 01:13:46,0
which he did cause the

83
01:13:46,0 --> 01:13:46,0
shedding of much

84
01:13:46,0 --> 01:23:56,
blood; and few were his days.

85
01:23:56,0 --> 01:23:56,0
11 And Ethem,

86
01:23:56,0 --> 01:23:56,0
being a descendant

87
01:23:56,0 --> 01:23:56,0
of Ahah, did

88
01:23:56,0 --> 01:23:56,0
obtain the kingdom;

89
01:23:56,0 --> 01:23:56,0
and he also did do

90
01:23:56,0 --> 01:23:56,0
that which was

91
01:23:56,0 --> 01:30:07,
wicked in his days.

92
01:30:07,0 --> 01:30:07,0
12 And it came

93
01:30:07,0 --> 01:30:07,0
to pass that in

94
01:30:07,0 --> 01:30:07,0
the days of Ethem

95
01:30:07,0 --> 01:30:07,0
there came many

96
01:30:07,0 --> 01:30:07,0
prophets, and

97
01:30:07,0 --> 01:30:07,0
prophesied again

98
01:30:07,0 --> 01:30:07,0
unto the people;

99
01:30:07,0 --> 01:30:07,0
yea, they did

100
01:30:07,0 --> 01:30:07,0
prophesy that the

101
01:30:07,0 --> 01:30:07,0
Lord would

102
01:30:07,0 --> 01:30:07,0
utterly destroy them

103
01:30:07,0 --> 01:30:07,0
from off the

104
01:30:07,0 --> 01:30:07,0
face of the earth

105
01:30:07,0 --> 01:30:07,0
except they

106
01:30:07,0 --> 01:53:11,
repented of their iniquities.

107
01:53:11,0 --> 01:53:11,0
13 And it came

108
01:53:11,0 --> 01:53:11,0
to pass that

109
01:53:11,0 --> 01:53:11,0
the people

110
01:53:11,0 --> 01:53:11,0
hardened their

111
01:53:11,0 --> 01:53:11,0
hearts, and

112
01:53:11,0 --> 01:53:11,0
would not hearken

113
01:53:11,0 --> 01:53:11,0
unto their

114
01:53:11,0 --> 01:53:11,0
words; and the

115
01:53:11,0 --> 01:53:11,0
prophets mourned

116
01:53:11,0 --> 01:53:11,0
and withdrew

117
01:53:11,0 --> 01:59:52,
from among the people.

118
01:59:52,0 --> 01:59:52,0
14 And it came

119
01:59:52,0 --> 01:59:52,0
to pass that

120
01:59:52,0 --> 01:59:52,0
Ethem did

121
01:59:52,0 --> 01:59:52,0
execute judgment

122
01:59:52,0 --> 01:59:52,0
in wickedness

123
01:59:52,0 --> 01:59:52,0
all his days;

124
01:59:52,0 --> 01:59:52,0
and he begat

125
01:59:52,0 --> 01:59:52,0
Moron. And it

126
01:59:52,0 --> 01:59:52,0
came to pass

127
01:59:52,0 --> 01:59:52,0
that Moron did

128
01:59:52,0 --> 01:59:52,0
reign in his

129
01:59:52,0 --> 01:59:52,0
stead; and Moron

130
01:59:52,0 --> 01:59:52,0
did that which

131
01:59:52,0 --> 01:59:52,0
was wicked

132
01:59:52,0 --> 02:07:36,
before the Lord.

133
02:07:36,0 --> 02:07:36,0
15 And it

134
02:07:36,0 --> 02:07:36,0
came to pass

135
02:07:36,0 --> 02:07:36,0
that there arose

136
02:07:36,0 --> 02:07:36,0
a rebellion

137
02:07:36,0 --> 02:07:36,0
among the

138
02:07:36,0 --> 02:07:36,0
people, because

139
02:07:36,0 --> 02:07:36,0
of that

140
02:07:36,0 --> 02:07:36,0
secret combination

141
02:07:36,0 --> 02:07:36,0
which was

142
02:07:36,0 --> 02:07:36,0
built up to get

143
02:07:36,0 --> 02:07:36,0
power and

144
02:07:36,0 --> 02:07:36,0
gain; and there

145
02:07:36,0 --> 02:07:36,0
arose a

146
02:07:36,0 --> 02:07:36,0
mighty man among

147
02:07:36,0 --> 02:07:36,0
them in

148
02:07:36,0 --> 02:07:36,0
iniquity, and gave

149
02:07:36,0 --> 02:07:36,0
battle unto

150
02:07:36,0 --> 02:07:36,0
Moron, in

151
02:07:36,0 --> 02:07:36,0
which he did

152
02:07:36,0 --> 02:07:36,0
overthrow the

153
02:07:36,0 --> 02:07:36,0
half of the

154
02:07:36,0 --> 02:07:36,0
kingdom; and he

155
02:07:36,0 --> 02:07:36,0
did maintain

156
02:07:36,0 --> 02:07:36,0
the half of

157
02:07:36,0 --> 02:20:44,
the kingdom for many years.

158
02:20:44,0 --> 02:20:44,0
16 And it

159
02:20:44,0 --> 02:20:44,0
came to pass

160
02:20:44,0 --> 02:20:44,0
that Moron

161
02:20:44,0 --> 02:20:44,0
did overthrow

162
02:20:44,0 --> 02:20:44,0
him, and did

163
02:20:44,0 --> 02:20:44,0
obtain the

164
02:20:44,0 --> 02:22:56,
kingdom again.

165
02:22:56,0 --> 02:22:56,0
17 And it

166
02:22:56,0 --> 02:22:56,0
came to pass

167
02:22:56,0 --> 02:22:56,0
that there

168
02:22:56,0 --> 02:22:56,0
arose another

169
02:22:56,0 --> 02:22:56,0
mighty man;

170
02:22:56,0 --> 02:22:56,0
and he was a

171
02:22:56,0 --> 02:22:56,0
descendant

172
02:22:56,0 --> 02:22:56,0
of the

173
02:22:56,0 --> 02:22:28,
brother of Jared.

174
02:22:28,0 --> 02:22:28,0
18 And it

175
02:22:28,0 --> 02:22:28,0
came to pass

176
02:22:28,0 --> 02:22:28,0
that he

177
02:22:28,0 --> 02:22:28,0
did overthrow

178
02:22:28,0 --> 02:22:28,0
Moron and

179
02:22:28,0 --> 02:22:28,0
obtain the

180
02:22:28,0 --> 02:22:28,0
kingdom;

181
02:22:28,0 --> 02:22:28,0
wherefore,

182
02:22:28,0 --> 02:22:28,0
Moron dwelt

183
02:22:28,0 --> 02:22:28,0
in captivity

184
02:22:28,0 --> 02:22:28,0
all the

185
02:22:28,0 --> 02:22:28,0
remainder of

186
02:22:28,0 --> 02:22:28,0
his days;

187
02:22:28,0 --> 02:29:58,
and he begat Coriantor.

188
02:29:58,0 --> 02:29:58,0
19 And it

189
02:29:58,0 --> 02:29:58,0
came to

190
02:29:58,0 --> 02:29:58,0
pass that

191
02:29:58,0 --> 02:29:58,0
Coriantor

192
02:29:58,0 --> 02:29:58,0
dwelt in

193
02:29:58,0 --> 02:29:58,0
captivity all

194
02:29:58,0 --> 02:35:08,
his days.

195
02:35:08,0 --> 02:35:08,0
20 And in

196
02:35:08,0 --> 02:35:08,0
the days

197
02:35:08,0 --> 02:35:08,0
of

198
02:35:08,0 --> 02:35:08,0
Coriantor

199
02:35:08,0 --> 02:35:08,0
there also

200
02:35:08,0 --> 02:35:08,0
came many

201
02:35:08,0 --> 02:35:08,0
prophets,

202
02:35:08,0 --> 02:35:08,0
and

203
02:35:08,0 --> 02:35:08,0
prophesied of

204
02:35:08,0 --> 02:35:08,0
great and

205
02:35:08,0 --> 02:35:08,0


206
02:35:08,0 --> 02:35:08,0
marvelous things,

207
02:35:08,0 --> 02:35:08,0
and

208
02:35:08,0 --> 02:35:08,0
cried

209
02:35:08,0 --> 02:35:08,0
repentance unto

210
02:35:08,0 --> 02:35:08,0
the

211
02:35:08,0 --> 02:35:08,0
people, and

212
02:35:08,0 --> 02:35:08,0
except they

213
02:35:08,0 --> 02:35:08,0
should

214
02:35:08,0 --> 02:35:08,0
repent the

215
02:35:08,0 --> 02:35:08,0
Lord God

216
02:35:08,0 --> 02:35:08,0
would

217
02:35:08,0 --> 02:35:08,0
execute

218
02:35:08,0 --> 02:35:08,0
judgment

219
02:35:08,0 --> 02:35:08,0
against them

220
02:35:08,0 --> 02:44:17,
to their utter destruction;

221
02:44:17,0 --> 02:44:17,0
21 And

222
02:44:17,0 --> 02:44:17,0
that the

223
02:44:17,0 --> 02:44:17,0
Lord God

224
02:44:17,0 --> 02:44:17,0
