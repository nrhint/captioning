00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 9 The kingdom passes from one to another

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
by descent, intrigue, and murder—Emer saw the Son

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of Righteousness—Many prophets cry repentance—A

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:10:40,
famine and poisonous serpents plague the people. 

5
00:10:40,0 --> 00:10:40,0
1 And now I, Moroni, proceed with my record.

6
00:10:40,0 --> 00:10:40,0
Therefore, behold, it came to pass that because of

7
00:10:40,0 --> 00:10:40,0
the secret combinations of Akish and his

8
00:10:40,0 --> 00:16:51,
friends, behold, they did overthrow the kingdom of Omer.

9
00:16:51,0 --> 00:16:51,0
2 Nevertheless, the Lord was merciful

10
00:16:51,0 --> 00:16:51,0
unto Omer, and also to his sons and to his

11
00:16:51,0 --> 00:19:03,
daughters who did not seek his destruction.

12
00:19:03,0 --> 00:19:03,0
3 And the Lord warned Omer in a dream

13
00:19:03,0 --> 00:19:03,0
that he should depart out of the land;

14
00:19:03,0 --> 00:19:03,0
wherefore Omer departed out of the land

15
00:19:03,0 --> 00:19:03,0
with his family, and traveled many

16
00:19:03,0 --> 00:19:03,0
days, and came over and passed by the hill

17
00:19:03,0 --> 00:19:03,0
of Shim, and came over by the place

18
00:19:03,0 --> 00:19:03,0
where the Nephites were destroyed, and

19
00:19:03,0 --> 00:19:03,0
from thence eastward, and came to a place

20
00:19:03,0 --> 00:19:03,0
which was called Ablom, by the

21
00:19:03,0 --> 00:19:03,0
seashore, and there he pitched his tent, and

22
00:19:03,0 --> 00:19:03,0
also his sons and his daughters, and all

23
00:19:03,0 --> 00:27:44,
his household, save it were Jared and his family.

24
00:27:44,0 --> 00:27:44,0
4 And it came to pass that Jared

25
00:27:44,0 --> 00:27:44,0
was anointed king over the people,

26
00:27:44,0 --> 00:27:44,0
by the hand of wickedness; and he

27
00:27:44,0 --> 00:30:12,
gave unto Akish his daughter to wife.

28
00:30:12,0 --> 00:30:12,0
5 And it came to pass that

29
00:30:12,0 --> 00:30:12,0
Akish sought the life of his

30
00:30:12,0 --> 00:30:12,0
father-in-law; and he applied unto

31
00:30:12,0 --> 00:30:12,0
those whom he had sworn by the

32
00:30:12,0 --> 00:30:12,0
oath of the ancients, and they

33
00:30:12,0 --> 00:30:12,0
obtained the head of his

34
00:30:12,0 --> 00:30:12,0
father-in-law, as he sat upon his

35
00:30:12,0 --> 00:36:53,
throne, giving audience to his people.

36
00:36:53,0 --> 00:36:53,0
6 For so great had been the

37
00:36:53,0 --> 00:36:53,0
spreading of this wicked and

38
00:36:53,0 --> 00:36:53,0
secret society that it had

39
00:36:53,0 --> 00:36:53,0
corrupted the hearts of all

40
00:36:53,0 --> 00:36:53,0
the people; therefore Jared

41
00:36:53,0 --> 00:36:53,0
was murdered upon his

42
00:36:53,0 --> 00:36:25,
throne, and Akish reigned in his stead.

43
00:36:25,0 --> 00:36:25,0
7 And it came to pass that

44
00:36:25,0 --> 00:36:25,0
Akish began to be jealous

45
00:36:25,0 --> 00:36:25,0
of his son, therefore he

46
00:36:25,0 --> 00:36:25,0
shut him up in prison, and

47
00:36:25,0 --> 00:36:25,0
kept him upon little or no

48
00:36:25,0 --> 00:35:57,
food until he had suffered death.

49
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
8 And now the brother of

50
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
him that suffered death,

51
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
(and his name was Nimrah)

52
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
was angry with his father

53
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
because of that which his

54
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:43,
father had done unto his brother.

55
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
9 And it came to pass

56
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
that Nimrah gathered

57
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
together a small number

58
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
of men, and fled out

59
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
of the land, and came

60
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:57,
over and dwelt with Omer.

61
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
10 And it came to

62
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
pass that Akish begat

63
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
other sons, and they

64
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
won the hearts of the

65
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
people,

66
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
notwithstanding they had sworn unto

67
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
him to do all manner

68
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
of iniquity

69
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:43,
according to that which he desired.

70
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
11 Now the people of

71
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
Akish were desirous

72
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
for gain, even as

73
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
Akish was desirous

74
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
for power; wherefore,

75
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
the sons of Akish

76
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
did offer them money,

77
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
by which means they

78
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
drew away the more

79
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:57,
part of the people after them.

80
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
12 And there began

81
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
to be a war between

82
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
the sons of Akish and

83
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
Akish, which lasted

84
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
for the space of

85
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
many years, yea, unto

86
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
the destruction of

87
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
nearly all the people

88
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
of the kingdom,

89
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
yea, even all, save it

90
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
were thirty souls,

91
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
and they who fled

92
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:43,
with the house of Omer.

93
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
13 Wherefore,

94
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
Omer was restored

95
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
again to the land

96
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:57,
of his inheritance.

97
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
14 And it came

98
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
to pass that Omer

99
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
began to be

100
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
old; nevertheless,

101
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
in his old age

102
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
he begat Emer;

103
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
and he anointed

104
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
Emer to be king to

105
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:43,
reign in his stead.

106
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
15 And after

107
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
that he had

108
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
anointed Emer to be

109
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
king he saw

110
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
peace in the land

111
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
for the space

112
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
of two years,

113
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
and he died,

114
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
having seen

115
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
exceedingly many days,

116
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
which were

117
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
full of sorrow.

118
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
And it came to

119
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
pass that Emer

120
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
did reign in his

121
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
stead, and did

122
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:57,
fill the steps of his father.

123
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
16 And the Lord

124
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
began again to

125
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
take the curse

126
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
from off the

127
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
land, and the

128
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
house of Emer did

129
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
prosper

130
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
exceedingly under the

131
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
reign of Emer;

132
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
and in the

133
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
space of sixty and

134
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
two years they

135
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
had become

136
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
exceedingly

137
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
strong, insomuch that

138
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
they became

139
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:43,
exceedingly rich—

140
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
17 Having all

141
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
manner of

142
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
fruit, and of

143
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
grain, and of

144
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
silks, and of fine

145
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
linen, and of

146
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
gold, and of

147
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
silver, and of

148
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:57,
precious things;

149
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
18 And also

150
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
all manner of

151
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
cattle, of

152
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
oxen, and cows,

153
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
and of

154
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
sheep, and of

155
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
swine, and of

156
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
goats, and also

157
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
many other

158
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
kinds of

159
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
animals which were

160
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
useful for

161
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:43,
the food of man.

162
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
19 And they

163
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
also had

164
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
horses, and

165
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
asses, and

166
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
there were

167
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
elephants and

168
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
cureloms and

169
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
cumoms; all of

170
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
which were

171
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
useful unto

172
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
man, and

173
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
more especially

174
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
the

175
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
elephants and

176
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:57,
cureloms and cumoms.

177
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
20 And thus

178
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
the Lord did

179
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
pour out

180
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
his blessings

181
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
upon this

182
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
land, which

183
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
was choice

184
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
above all other

185
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
lands; and

186
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
he commanded

187
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
that whoso

188
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
should

189
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
possess the land

190
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
should

191
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
possess it unto

192
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
the Lord, or

193
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
they should

194
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
be destroyed

195
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
when they

196
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
were ripened

197
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
in iniquity;

198
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
for upon

199
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
such, saith

200
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
the Lord: I

201
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
will pour out

202
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
the fulness

203
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:43,
of my wrath.

204
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
21 And Emer

205
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
did

206
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
execute judgment

207
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
in

208
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
righteousness all

209
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
his days,

210
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
and he begat

211
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
many sons

212
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
and

213
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
daughters; and he

214
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
begat

215
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
Coriantum, and he

216
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
anointed

217
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:43,0
Coriantum to

218
00:35:43,0 --> 00:35:57,
reign in his stead.

219
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
22 And

220
00:35:57,0 --> 00:35:57,0
