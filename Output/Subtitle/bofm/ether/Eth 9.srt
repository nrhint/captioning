00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:05,5
Chapter 9 The kingdom passes from one to another

2
00:00:05,5 --> 00:00:11,0
by descent, intrigue, and murder—Emer saw the Son

3
00:00:11,0 --> 00:00:16,5
of Righteousness—Many prophets cry repentance—A

4
00:00:16,5 --> 00:00:22,256
famine and poisonous serpents plague the people. 

5
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:24,006
1 And now I, Moroni, proceed with my record.

6
00:00:24,006 --> 00:00:25,756
Therefore, behold, it came to pass that because of

7
00:00:25,756 --> 00:00:27,506
the secret combinations of Akish and his

8
00:00:27,506 --> 00:00:29,763
friends, behold, they did overthrow the kingdom of Omer.

9
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:32,096
2 Nevertheless, the Lord was merciful

10
00:00:32,096 --> 00:00:34,429
unto Omer, and also to his sons and to his

11
00:00:34,429 --> 00:00:36,803
daughters who did not seek his destruction.

12
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:38,386
3 And the Lord warned Omer in a dream

13
00:00:38,386 --> 00:00:39,969
that he should depart out of the land;

14
00:00:39,969 --> 00:00:41,552
wherefore Omer departed out of the land

15
00:00:41,552 --> 00:00:43,135
with his family, and traveled many

16
00:00:43,135 --> 00:00:44,718
days, and came over and passed by the hill

17
00:00:44,718 --> 00:00:46,301
of Shim, and came over by the place

18
00:00:46,301 --> 00:00:47,884
where the Nephites were destroyed, and

19
00:00:47,884 --> 00:00:49,467
from thence eastward, and came to a place

20
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:51,05
which was called Ablom, by the

21
00:00:51,05 --> 00:00:52,633
seashore, and there he pitched his tent, and

22
00:00:52,633 --> 00:00:54,216
also his sons and his daughters, and all

23
00:00:54,216 --> 00:00:55,155
his household, save it were Jared and his family.

24
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:56,655
4 And it came to pass that Jared

25
00:00:56,655 --> 00:00:58,155
was anointed king over the people,

26
00:00:58,155 --> 00:00:59,655
by the hand of wickedness; and he

27
00:00:59,655 --> 00:01:01,028
gave unto Akish his daughter to wife.

28
00:01:01,028 --> 00:01:01,903
5 And it came to pass that

29
00:01:01,903 --> 00:01:02,778
Akish sought the life of his

30
00:01:02,778 --> 00:01:03,653
father-in-law; and he applied unto

31
00:01:03,653 --> 00:01:04,528
those whom he had sworn by the

32
00:01:04,528 --> 00:01:05,403
oath of the ancients, and they

33
00:01:05,403 --> 00:01:06,278
obtained the head of his

34
00:01:06,278 --> 00:01:07,153
father-in-law, as he sat upon his

35
00:01:07,153 --> 00:01:08,068
throne, giving audience to his people.

36
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:08,782
6 For so great had been the

37
00:01:08,782 --> 00:01:09,496
spreading of this wicked and

38
00:01:09,496 --> 00:01:10,21
secret society that it had

39
00:01:10,21 --> 00:01:10,924
corrupted the hearts of all

40
00:01:10,924 --> 00:01:11,638
the people; therefore Jared

41
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:12,352
was murdered upon his

42
00:01:12,352 --> 00:01:13,473
throne, and Akish reigned in his stead.

43
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:13,306
7 And it came to pass that

44
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:13,139
Akish began to be jealous

45
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:12,972
of his son, therefore he

46
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:12,805
shut him up in prison, and

47
00:01:12,805 --> 00:01:12,638
kept him upon little or no

48
00:01:12,638 --> 00:01:12,539
food until he had suffered death.

49
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:25,539
8 And now the brother of

50
00:01:25,539 --> 00:01:38,539
him that suffered death,

51
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:51,539
(and his name was Nimrah)

52
00:01:51,539 --> 00:02:04,539
was angry with his father

53
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:17,539
because of that which his

54
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:30,617
father had done unto his brother.

55
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:32,117
9 And it came to pass

56
00:02:32,117 --> 00:02:33,617
that Nimrah gathered

57
00:02:33,617 --> 00:02:35,117
together a small number

58
00:02:35,117 --> 00:02:36,617
of men, and fled out

59
00:02:36,617 --> 00:02:38,117
of the land, and came

60
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:39,059
over and dwelt with Omer.

61
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:40,17
10 And it came to

62
00:02:40,17 --> 00:02:41,281
pass that Akish begat

63
00:02:41,281 --> 00:02:42,392
other sons, and they

64
00:02:42,392 --> 00:02:43,503
won the hearts of the

65
00:02:43,503 --> 00:02:44,614
people,

66
00:02:44,614 --> 00:02:45,725
notwithstanding they had sworn unto

67
00:02:45,725 --> 00:02:46,836
him to do all manner

68
00:02:46,836 --> 00:02:47,947
of iniquity

69
00:02:47,947 --> 00:02:49,403
according to that which he desired.

70
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:51,003
11 Now the people of

71
00:02:51,003 --> 00:02:52,603
Akish were desirous

72
00:02:52,603 --> 00:02:54,203
for gain, even as

73
00:02:54,203 --> 00:02:55,803
Akish was desirous

74
00:02:55,803 --> 00:02:57,403
for power; wherefore,

75
00:02:57,403 --> 00:02:59,003
the sons of Akish

76
00:02:59,003 --> 00:03:00,603
did offer them money,

77
00:03:00,603 --> 00:03:02,203
by which means they

78
00:03:02,203 --> 00:03:03,803
drew away the more

79
00:03:03,803 --> 00:03:05,819
part of the people after them.

80
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,588
12 And there began

81
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:09,357
to be a war between

82
00:03:09,357 --> 00:03:11,126
the sons of Akish and

83
00:03:11,126 --> 00:03:12,895
Akish, which lasted

84
00:03:12,895 --> 00:03:14,664
for the space of

85
00:03:14,664 --> 00:03:16,433
many years, yea, unto

86
00:03:16,433 --> 00:03:18,202
the destruction of

87
00:03:18,202 --> 00:03:19,971
nearly all the people

88
00:03:19,971 --> 00:03:21,74
of the kingdom,

89
00:03:21,74 --> 00:03:23,509
yea, even all, save it

90
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:25,278
were thirty souls,

91
00:03:25,278 --> 00:03:27,047
and they who fled

92
00:03:27,047 --> 00:03:28,075
with the house of Omer.

93
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:29,825
13 Wherefore,

94
00:03:29,825 --> 00:03:31,575
Omer was restored

95
00:03:31,575 --> 00:03:33,325
again to the land

96
00:03:33,325 --> 00:03:35,115
of his inheritance.

97
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:37,115
14 And it came

98
00:03:37,115 --> 00:03:39,115
to pass that Omer

99
00:03:39,115 --> 00:03:41,115
began to be

100
00:03:41,115 --> 00:03:43,115
old; nevertheless,

101
00:03:43,115 --> 00:03:45,115
in his old age

102
00:03:45,115 --> 00:03:47,115
he begat Emer;

103
00:03:47,115 --> 00:03:49,115
and he anointed

104
00:03:49,115 --> 00:03:51,115
Emer to be king to

105
00:03:51,115 --> 00:03:53,433
reign in his stead.

106
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:54,727
15 And after

107
00:03:54,727 --> 00:03:56,021
that he had

108
00:03:56,021 --> 00:03:57,315
anointed Emer to be

109
00:03:57,315 --> 00:03:58,609
king he saw

110
00:03:58,609 --> 00:03:59,903
peace in the land

111
00:03:59,903 --> 00:04:01,197
for the space

112
00:04:01,197 --> 00:04:02,491
of two years,

113
00:04:02,491 --> 00:04:03,785
and he died,

114
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,079
having seen

115
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:06,373
exceedingly many days,

116
00:04:06,373 --> 00:04:07,667
which were

117
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:08,961
full of sorrow.

118
00:04:08,961 --> 00:04:10,255
And it came to

119
00:04:10,255 --> 00:04:11,549
pass that Emer

120
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:12,843
did reign in his

121
00:04:12,843 --> 00:04:14,137
stead, and did

122
00:04:14,137 --> 00:04:15,689
fill the steps of his father.

123
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:16,218
16 And the Lord

124
00:04:16,218 --> 00:04:16,747
began again to

125
00:04:16,747 --> 00:04:17,276
take the curse

126
00:04:17,276 --> 00:04:17,805
from off the

127
00:04:17,805 --> 00:04:18,334
land, and the

128
00:04:18,334 --> 00:04:18,863
house of Emer did

129
00:04:18,863 --> 00:04:19,392
prosper

130
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:19,921
exceedingly under the

131
00:04:19,921 --> 00:04:20,45
reign of Emer;

132
00:04:20,45 --> 00:04:20,979
and in the

133
00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:21,508
space of sixty and

134
00:04:21,508 --> 00:04:22,037
two years they

135
00:04:22,037 --> 00:04:22,566
had become

136
00:04:22,566 --> 00:04:23,095
exceedingly

137
00:04:23,095 --> 00:04:23,624
strong, insomuch that

138
00:04:23,624 --> 00:04:24,153
they became

139
00:04:24,153 --> 00:04:24,131
exceedingly rich—

140
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:24,909
17 Having all

141
00:04:24,909 --> 00:04:25,687
manner of

142
00:04:25,687 --> 00:04:26,465
fruit, and of

143
00:04:26,465 --> 00:04:27,243
grain, and of

144
00:04:27,243 --> 00:04:28,021
silks, and of fine

145
00:04:28,021 --> 00:04:28,799
linen, and of

146
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,577
gold, and of

147
00:04:29,577 --> 00:04:30,355
silver, and of

148
00:04:30,355 --> 00:04:31,171
precious things;

149
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:31,479
18 And also

150
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:31,787
all manner of

151
00:04:31,787 --> 00:04:32,095
cattle, of

152
00:04:32,095 --> 00:04:32,403
oxen, and cows,

153
00:04:32,403 --> 00:04:32,711
and of

154
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:33,019
sheep, and of

155
00:04:33,019 --> 00:04:33,327
swine, and of

156
00:04:33,327 --> 00:04:33,635
goats, and also

157
00:04:33,635 --> 00:04:33,943
many other

158
00:04:33,943 --> 00:04:34,251
kinds of

159
00:04:34,251 --> 00:04:34,559
animals which were

160
00:04:34,559 --> 00:04:34,867
useful for

161
00:04:34,867 --> 00:04:35,575
the food of man.

162
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:35,842
19 And they

163
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:36,109
also had

164
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:36,376
horses, and

165
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:36,643
asses, and

166
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:36,91
there were

167
00:04:36,91 --> 00:04:37,177
elephants and

168
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:37,444
cureloms and

169
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:37,711
cumoms; all of

170
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:37,978
which were

171
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:38,245
useful unto

172
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:38,512
man, and

173
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:38,779
more especially

174
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:39,046
the

175
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:39,313
elephants and

176
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:39,98
cureloms and cumoms.

177
00:04:39,98 --> 00:04:40,313
20 And thus

178
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:40,646
the Lord did

179
00:04:40,646 --> 00:04:40,979
pour out

180
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:41,312
his blessings

181
00:04:41,312 --> 00:04:41,645
upon this

182
00:04:41,645 --> 00:04:41,978
land, which

183
00:04:41,978 --> 00:04:42,311
was choice

184
00:04:42,311 --> 00:04:42,644
above all other

185
00:04:42,644 --> 00:04:42,977
lands; and

186
00:04:42,977 --> 00:04:43,31
he commanded

187
00:04:43,31 --> 00:04:43,643
that whoso

188
00:04:43,643 --> 00:04:43,976
should

189
00:04:43,976 --> 00:04:44,309
possess the land

190
00:04:44,309 --> 00:04:44,642
should

191
00:04:44,642 --> 00:04:44,975
possess it unto

192
00:04:44,975 --> 00:04:45,308
the Lord, or

193
00:04:45,308 --> 00:04:45,641
they should

194
00:04:45,641 --> 00:04:45,974
be destroyed

195
00:04:45,974 --> 00:04:46,307
when they

196
00:04:46,307 --> 00:04:46,64
were ripened

197
00:04:46,64 --> 00:04:46,973
in iniquity;

198
00:04:46,973 --> 00:04:47,306
