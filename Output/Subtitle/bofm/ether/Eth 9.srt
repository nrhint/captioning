00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:09,5
Chapter 9 The kingdom passes from one to another

2
00:00:09,5 --> 00:00:19,0
 by descent, intrigue, and murder—Emer saw the Son

3
00:00:19,0 --> 00:00:28,5
 of Righteousness—Many prophets cry repentance—A

4
00:00:28,5 --> 00:00:38,0
 famine and poisonous serpents plague the people.

5
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:46,656
1 And now I, Moroni, proceed with my record.

6
00:00:46,656 --> 00:00:54,406
 Therefore, behold, it came to pass that because of the

7
00:00:54,406 --> 00:01:02,156
 secret combinations of Akish and his friends,

8
00:01:02,156 --> 00:01:09,906
 behold, they did overthrow the kingdom of Omer

9
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,403
2 Nevertheless, the Lord was merciful unto Omer,

10
00:01:12,403 --> 00:01:15,07
 and also to his sons and to his daughters who did

11
00:01:15,07 --> 00:01:17,737
 not seek his destruction

12
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:23,444
3 And the Lord warned Omer in a dream that he

13
00:01:23,444 --> 00:01:29,844
 should depart out of the land; wherefore Omer departed

14
00:01:29,844 --> 00:01:36,244
 out of the land with his family, and traveled

15
00:01:36,244 --> 00:01:42,644
 many days, and came over and passed by the hill of

16
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:49,044
 Shim, and came over by the place where the Nephites

17
00:01:49,044 --> 00:01:55,444
 were destroyed, and from thence eastward, and came

18
00:01:55,444 --> 00:02:01,844
 to a place which was called Ablom, by the

19
00:02:01,844 --> 00:02:08,244
 seashore, and there he pitched his tent, and also his

20
00:02:08,244 --> 00:02:14,644
 sons and his daughters, and all his household, save

21
00:02:14,644 --> 00:02:21,044
 it were Jared and his family

22
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:27,541
4 And it came to pass that Jared was anointed king

23
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:33,874
 over the people, by the hand of wickedness; and

24
00:02:33,874 --> 00:02:40,207
 he gave unto Akish his daughter to wife

25
00:02:40,46 --> 00:02:45,293
5 And it came to pass that Akish sought the life

26
00:02:45,293 --> 00:02:50,126
 of his father-in-law; and he applied unto those

27
00:02:50,126 --> 00:02:54,959
 whom he had sworn by the oath of the ancients, and

28
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,792
 they obtained the head of his father-in-law, as he

29
00:02:59,792 --> 00:03:04,625
 sat upon his throne, giving audience to his people

30
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:09,458


31
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:15,023
6 For so great had been the spreading of this

32
00:03:15,023 --> 00:03:20,623
 wicked and secret society that it had corrupted the

33
00:03:20,623 --> 00:03:26,223
 hearts of all the people; therefore Jared was

34
00:03:26,223 --> 00:03:31,823
 murdered upon his throne, and Akish reigned in his

35
00:03:31,823 --> 00:03:37,423
 stead

36
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:41,867
7 And it came to pass that Akish began to be

37
00:03:41,867 --> 00:03:46,617
 jealous of his son, therefore he shut him up in prison,

38
00:03:46,617 --> 00:03:51,367
 and kept him upon little or no food until he had

39
00:03:51,367 --> 00:03:56,117
 suffered death

40
00:03:56,603 --> 00:04:01,603
8 And now the brother of him that suffered death,

41
00:04:01,603 --> 00:04:06,603
 (and his name was Nimrah) was angry with his

42
00:04:06,603 --> 00:04:11,603
 father because of that which his father had done unto

43
00:04:11,603 --> 00:04:16,603
 his brother

44
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:21,089
9 And it came to pass that Nimrah gathered

45
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:26,089
 together a small number of men, and fled out of the land,

46
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:31,089
 and came over and dwelt with Omer

47
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:37,088
10 And it came to pass that Akish begat other

48
00:04:37,088 --> 00:04:42,838
 sons, and they won the hearts of the people,

49
00:04:42,838 --> 00:04:48,588
 notwithstanding they had sworn unto him to do all manner of

50
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:54,338
 iniquity according to that which he desired

51
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:59,127
11 Now the people of Akish were desirous for gain,

52
00:04:59,127 --> 00:05:03,927
 even as Akish was desirous for power; wherefore,

53
00:05:03,927 --> 00:05:08,727
 the sons of Akish did offer them money, by which

54
00:05:08,727 --> 00:05:13,527
 means they drew away the more part of the people

55
00:05:13,527 --> 00:05:18,327
 after them

56
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:24,951
12 And there began to be a war between the sons of

57
00:05:24,951 --> 00:05:31,284
 Akish and Akish, which lasted for the space of

58
00:05:31,284 --> 00:05:37,617
 many years, yea, unto the destruction of nearly all

59
00:05:37,617 --> 00:05:43,95
 the people of the kingdom, yea, even all, save it

60
00:05:43,95 --> 00:05:50,283
 were thirty souls, and they who fled with the

61
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:56,616
 house of Omer

62
00:05:56,823 --> 00:06:01,823
13 Wherefore, Omer was restored again to the land

63
00:06:01,823 --> 00:06:06,823
 of his inheritance

64
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:12,132
14 And it came to pass that Omer began to be old;

65
00:06:12,132 --> 00:06:18,132
 nevertheless, in his old age he begat Emer; and he

66
00:06:18,132 --> 00:06:24,132
 anointed Emer to be king to reign in his stead

67
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:30,351
15 And after that he had anointed Emer to be king

68
00:06:30,351 --> 00:06:36,518
 he saw peace in the land for the space of two

69
00:06:36,518 --> 00:06:42,685
 years, and he died, having seen exceedingly many days,

70
00:06:42,685 --> 00:06:48,852
 which were full of sorrow. And it came to pass

71
00:06:48,852 --> 00:06:55,019
 that Emer did reign in his stead, and did fill the

72
00:06:55,019 --> 00:07:01,186
 steps of his father

73
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:07,022
16 And the Lord began again to take the curse from

74
00:07:07,022 --> 00:07:12,189
 off the land, and the house of Emer did prosper

75
00:07:12,189 --> 00:07:17,356
 exceedingly under the reign of Emer; and in the

76
00:07:17,356 --> 00:07:22,523
 space of sixty and two years they had become

77
00:07:22,523 --> 00:07:27,69
 exceedingly strong, insomuch that they became exceedingly

78
00:07:27,69 --> 00:07:32,857
 rich

79
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:38,552
17 Having all manner of fruit, and of grain, and

80
00:07:38,552 --> 00:07:44,552
 of silks, and of fine linen, and of gold, and of

81
00:07:44,552 --> 00:07:50,552
 silver, and of precious things

82
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:56,337
18 And also all manner of cattle, of oxen, and

83
00:07:56,337 --> 00:08:01,837
 cows, and of sheep, and of swine, and of goats, and

84
00:08:01,837 --> 00:08:07,337
 also many other kinds of animals which were useful

85
00:08:07,337 --> 00:08:12,837
 for the food of man

86
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:19,292
19 And they also had horses, and asses, and there

87
00:08:19,292 --> 00:08:25,792
 were elephants and cureloms and cumoms; all of

88
00:08:25,792 --> 00:08:32,292
 which were useful unto man, and more especially the

89
00:08:32,292 --> 00:08:38,792
 elephants and cureloms and cumoms

90
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:44,604
20 And thus the Lord did pour out his blessings

91
00:08:44,604 --> 00:08:50,89
 upon this land, which was choice above all other

92
00:08:50,89 --> 00:08:57,176
 lands; and he commanded that whoso should possess the

93
00:08:57,176 --> 00:09:03,462
 land should possess it unto the Lord, or they

94
00:09:03,462 --> 00:09:09,748
 should be destroyed when they were ripened in

95
00:09:09,748 --> 00:09:16,034
 iniquity; for upon such, saith the Lord: I will pour out

96
00:09:16,034 --> 00:09:22,32
 the fulness of my wrath

97
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:29,512
21 And Emer did execute judgment in righteousness

98
00:09:29,512 --> 00:09:36,262
 all his days, and he begat many sons and

99
00:09:36,262 --> 00:09:43,012
 daughters; and he begat Coriantum, and he anointed

100
00:09:43,012 --> 00:09:49,762
 Coriantum to reign in his stead

101
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:56,289
22 And after he had anointed Coriantum to reign in

102
00:09:56,289 --> 00:10:02,689
 his stead he lived four years, and he saw peace

103
00:10:02,689 --> 00:10:09,089
 in the land; yea, and he even saw the Son of

104
00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:15,489
 Righteousness, and did rejoice and glory in his day; and

105
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:21,889
 he died in peace

106
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:27,621
23 And it came to pass that Coriantum did walk in

107
00:10:27,621 --> 00:10:33,454
 the steps of his father, and did build many mighty

108
00:10:33,454 --> 00:10:39,287
 cities, and did administer that which was good

109
00:10:39,287 --> 00:10:45,12
 unto his people in all his days. And it came to pass

110
00:10:45,12 --> 00:10:50,953
 that he had no children even until he was

111
00:10:50,953 --> 00:10:56,786
 exceedingly old

112
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:59,689
24 And it came to pass that his wife died, being

113
00:10:59,689 --> 00:11:03,356
 an hundred and two years old. And it came to pass

114
00:11:03,356 --> 00:11:07,023
 that Coriantum took to wife, in his old age, a

115
00:11:07,023 --> 00:11:10,69
 young maid, and begat sons and daughters; wherefore he

116
00:11:10,69 --> 00:11:14,357
 lived until he was an hundred and forty and two

117
00:11:14,357 --> 00:11:18,024
 years old

118
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:24,228
25 And it came to pass that he begat Com, and Com

119
00:11:24,228 --> 00:11:29,478
 reigned in his stead; and he reigned forty and

120
00:11:29,478 --> 00:11:34,728
 nine years, and he begat Heth; and he also begat

121
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:39,978
 other sons and daughters

122
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:45,799
26 And the people had spread again over all the

123
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:51,599
 face of the land, and there began again to be an

124
00:11:51,599 --> 00:11:57,399
 exceedingly great wickedness upon the face of the

125
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:03,199
 land, and Heth began to embrace the secret plans

126
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:08,999
 again of old, to destroy his father

127
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:14,595
27 And it came to pass that he did dethrone his

128
00:12:14,595 --> 00:12:20,262
 father, for he slew him with his own sword; and he

129
00:12:20,262 --> 00:12:25,929
 did reign in his stead

130
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:31,445
28 And there came prophets in the land again,

131
00:12:31,445 --> 00:12:36,945
 crying repentance unto them—that they must prepare the

132
00:12:36,945 --> 00:12:42,445
 way of the Lord or there should come a curse upon

133
00:12:42,445 --> 00:12:47,945
 the face of the land; yea, even there should be a

134
00:12:47,945 --> 00:12:53,445
 great famine, in which they should be destroyed

135
00:12:53,445 --> 00:12:58,945
 if they did not repent

136
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:04,178
29 But the people believed not the words of the

137
00:13:04,178 --> 00:13:09,778
 prophets, but they cast them out; and some of them

138
00:13:09,778 --> 00:13:15,378
 they cast into pits and left them to perish. And it

139
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:20,978
 came to pass that they did all these things

140
00:13:20,978 --> 00:13:26,578
 according to the commandment of the king, Heth

141
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:30,672
30 And it came to pass that there began to be a

142
00:13:30,672 --> 00:13:35,072
 great dearth upon the land, and the inhabitants

143
00:13:35,072 --> 00:13:39,472
 began to be destroyed exceedingly fast because of the

144
00:13:39,472 --> 00:13:43,872
 dearth, for there was no rain upon the face of the

145
00:13:43,872 --> 00:13:48,272
 earth

146
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:53,56
31 And there came forth poisonous serpents also

147
00:13:53,56 --> 00:13:58,893
 upon the face of the land, and did poison many

148
00:13:58,893 --> 00:14:04,226
 people. And it came to pass that their flocks began to

149
00:14:04,226 --> 00:14:09,559
 flee before the poisonous serpents, towards the

150
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:14,892
 land southward, which was called by the Nephites

151
00:14:14,892 --> 00:14:20,225
 Zarahemla

152
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,492
32 And it came to pass that there were many of

153
00:14:24,492 --> 00:14:28,825
 them which did perish by the way; nevertheless, there

154
00:14:28,825 --> 00:14:33,158
 were some which fled into the land southward

155
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:38,372
33 And it came to pass that the Lord did cause the

156
00:14:38,372 --> 00:14:43,572
 serpents that they should pursue them no more,

157
00:14:43,572 --> 00:14:48,772
 but that they should hedge up the way that the

158
00:14:48,772 --> 00:14:53,972
 people could not pass, that whoso should attempt to

159
00:14:53,972 --> 00:14:59,172
 pass might fall by the poisonous serpents

160
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:05,399
34 And it came to pass that the people did follow

161
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:10,899
 the course of the beasts, and did devour the

162
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:16,399
 carcasses of them which fell by the way, until they had

163
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:21,899
 devoured them all. Now when the people saw that

164
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:27,399
 they must perish they began to repent of their

165
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:32,899
 iniquities and cry unto the Lord

166
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:37,918
35 And it came to pass that when they had humbled

167
00:15:37,918 --> 00:15:43,204
 themselves sufficiently before the Lord he did

168
00:15:43,204 --> 00:15:48,49
 send rain upon the face of the earth; and the people

169
00:15:48,49 --> 00:15:53,776
 began to revive again, and there began to be fruit

170
00:15:53,776 --> 00:15:59,062
 in the north countries, and in all the countries

171
00:15:59,062 --> 00:16:04,348
 round about. And the Lord did show forth his power

172
00:16:04,348 --> 00:16:09,634
 unto them in preserving them from famine.
