00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:03,75
Chapter 7 Orihah reigns in righteousness—Amid

2
00:00:03,75 --> 00:00:07,5
usurpation and strife, the rival kingdoms of Shule

3
00:00:07,5 --> 00:00:11,25
and Cohor are set up—Prophets condemn the

4
00:00:11,25 --> 00:00:15,482
wickedness and idolatry of the people, who then repent. 

5
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:20,149
1 And it came to pass that Orihah did

6
00:00:20,149 --> 00:00:24,816
execute judgment upon the land in righteousness

7
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:29,763
all his days, whose days were exceedingly many.

8
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:34,763
2 And he begat sons and daughters;

9
00:00:34,763 --> 00:00:39,763
yea, he begat thirty and one,

10
00:00:39,763 --> 00:00:44,778
among whom were twenty and three sons.

11
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:46,028
3 And it came to pass that he

12
00:00:46,028 --> 00:00:47,278
also begat Kib in his old age. And

13
00:00:47,278 --> 00:00:48,528
it came to pass that Kib reigned

14
00:00:48,528 --> 00:00:49,182
in his stead; and Kib begat Corihor.

15
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:50,432
4 And when Corihor was thirty

16
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:51,682
and two years old he rebelled

17
00:00:51,682 --> 00:00:52,932
against his father, and went

18
00:00:52,932 --> 00:00:54,182
over and dwelt in the land of

19
00:00:54,182 --> 00:00:55,432
Nehor; and he begat sons and

20
00:00:55,432 --> 00:00:56,682
daughters, and they became

21
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:57,932
exceedingly fair; wherefore Corihor

22
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:59,526
drew away many people after him.

23
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:00,276
5 And when he had gathered

24
00:01:00,276 --> 00:01:01,026
together an army he came up

25
00:01:01,026 --> 00:01:01,776
unto the land of Moron

26
00:01:01,776 --> 00:01:02,526
where the king dwelt, and took

27
00:01:02,526 --> 00:01:03,276
him captive, which brought

28
00:01:03,276 --> 00:01:04,026
to pass the saying of the

29
00:01:04,026 --> 00:01:04,776
brother of Jared that they

30
00:01:04,776 --> 00:01:05,399
would be brought into captivity.

31
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,899
6 Now the land of Moron,

32
00:01:07,899 --> 00:01:10,399
where the king dwelt, was

33
00:01:10,399 --> 00:01:12,899
near the land which is called

34
00:01:12,899 --> 00:01:15,776
Desolation by the Nephites.

35
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:19,151
7 And it came to pass

36
00:01:19,151 --> 00:01:22,526
that Kib dwelt in

37
00:01:22,526 --> 00:01:25,901
captivity, and his people under

38
00:01:25,901 --> 00:01:29,276
Corihor his son, until

39
00:01:29,276 --> 00:01:32,651
he became exceedingly

40
00:01:32,651 --> 00:01:36,026
old; nevertheless Kib begat

41
00:01:36,026 --> 00:01:39,401
Shule in his old age,

42
00:01:39,401 --> 00:01:42,069
while he was yet in captivity.

43
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:44,212
8 And it came to pass

44
00:01:44,212 --> 00:01:46,355
that Shule was angry

45
00:01:46,355 --> 00:01:48,498
with his brother; and

46
00:01:48,498 --> 00:01:50,641
Shule waxed strong, and

47
00:01:50,641 --> 00:01:52,784
became mighty as to the

48
00:01:52,784 --> 00:01:54,927
strength of a man; and he

49
00:01:54,927 --> 00:01:57,551
was also mighty in judgment.

50
00:01:57,551 --> 00:01:59,018
9 Wherefore, he came

51
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:00,485
to the hill Ephraim,

52
00:02:00,485 --> 00:02:01,952
and he did molten out of

53
00:02:01,952 --> 00:02:03,419
the hill, and made

54
00:02:03,419 --> 00:02:04,886
swords out of steel for

55
00:02:04,886 --> 00:02:06,353
those whom he had

56
00:02:06,353 --> 00:02:07,82
drawn away with him; and

57
00:02:07,82 --> 00:02:09,287
after he had armed them

58
00:02:09,287 --> 00:02:10,754
with swords he

59
00:02:10,754 --> 00:02:12,221
returned to the city Nehor,

60
00:02:12,221 --> 00:02:13,688
and gave battle unto

61
00:02:13,688 --> 00:02:15,155
his brother Corihor, by

62
00:02:15,155 --> 00:02:16,622
which means he

63
00:02:16,622 --> 00:02:18,089
obtained the kingdom and

64
00:02:18,089 --> 00:02:19,806
restored it unto his father Kib.

65
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:20,806
10 And now because of

66
00:02:20,806 --> 00:02:21,806
the thing which

67
00:02:21,806 --> 00:02:22,806
Shule had done, his

68
00:02:22,806 --> 00:02:23,806
father bestowed upon him

69
00:02:23,806 --> 00:02:24,806
the kingdom; therefore

70
00:02:24,806 --> 00:02:25,806
he began to reign in

71
00:02:25,806 --> 00:02:26,847
the stead of his father.

72
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:27,291
11 And it came to

73
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:27,735
pass that he did

74
00:02:27,735 --> 00:02:28,179
execute judgment in

75
00:02:28,179 --> 00:02:28,623
righteousness; and he

76
00:02:28,623 --> 00:02:29,067
did spread his

77
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:29,511
kingdom upon all the

78
00:02:29,511 --> 00:02:29,955
face of the land,

79
00:02:29,955 --> 00:02:30,399
for the people had

80
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:30,784
become exceedingly numerous.

81
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,534
12 And it came to

82
00:02:33,534 --> 00:02:36,284
pass that Shule

83
00:02:36,284 --> 00:02:39,034
also begat many

84
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:41,161
sons and daughters.

85
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,875
13 And Corihor

86
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:48,589
repented of the

87
00:02:48,589 --> 00:02:52,303
many evils

88
00:02:52,303 --> 00:02:56,017
which he had done;

89
00:02:56,017 --> 00:02:59,731
wherefore

90
00:02:59,731 --> 00:03:03,445
Shule gave him

91
00:03:03,445 --> 00:03:07,487
power in his kingdom.

92
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:08,487
14 And it came

93
00:03:08,487 --> 00:03:09,487
to pass that

94
00:03:09,487 --> 00:03:10,487
Corihor had

95
00:03:10,487 --> 00:03:11,487
many sons and

96
00:03:11,487 --> 00:03:12,487
daughters. And

97
00:03:12,487 --> 00:03:13,487
among the sons

98
00:03:13,487 --> 00:03:14,487
of Corihor

99
00:03:14,487 --> 00:03:15,487
there was one

100
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:16,897
whose name was Noah.

101
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:20,82
15 And it

102
00:03:20,82 --> 00:03:24,743
came to pass

103
00:03:24,743 --> 00:03:28,666
that Noah

104
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:32,589
rebelled against

105
00:03:32,589 --> 00:03:36,512
Shule, the

106
00:03:36,512 --> 00:03:40,435
king, and also

107
00:03:40,435 --> 00:03:44,358
his father

108
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:48,281
Corihor, and drew

109
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:52,204
away Cohor

110
00:03:52,204 --> 00:03:56,127
his brother,

111
00:03:56,127 --> 00:04:00,05
and also all

112
00:04:00,05 --> 00:04:03,973
his brethren

113
00:04:03,973 --> 00:04:07,114
and many of the people.

114
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:07,447
16 And he

115
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:07,78
gave battle

116
00:04:07,78 --> 00:04:08,113
unto Shule,

117
00:04:08,113 --> 00:04:08,446
the king, in

118
00:04:08,446 --> 00:04:08,779
which he did

119
00:04:08,779 --> 00:04:09,112
obtain the

120
00:04:09,112 --> 00:04:09,445
land of their

121
00:04:09,445 --> 00:04:09,778
first

122
00:04:09,778 --> 00:04:10,111
inheritance; and

123
00:04:10,111 --> 00:04:10,444
he became a

124
00:04:10,444 --> 00:04:10,777
king over

125
00:04:10,777 --> 00:04:11,518
that part of the land.

126
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:12,351
17 And it

127
00:04:12,351 --> 00:04:13,184
came to pass

128
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,017
that he

129
00:04:14,017 --> 00:04:14,85
gave battle

130
00:04:14,85 --> 00:04:15,683
again unto

131
00:04:15,683 --> 00:04:16,516
Shule, the

132
00:04:16,516 --> 00:04:17,349
king; and he

133
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:18,182
took

134
00:04:18,182 --> 00:04:19,015
Shule, the king,

135
00:04:19,015 --> 00:04:19,848
and

136
00:04:19,848 --> 00:04:20,681
carried him away

137
00:04:20,681 --> 00:04:21,862
captive into Moron.

138
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:21,992
18 And it

139
00:04:21,992 --> 00:04:22,122
came to

140
00:04:22,122 --> 00:04:22,252
pass as he

141
00:04:22,252 --> 00:04:22,382
was about

142
00:04:22,382 --> 00:04:22,512
to put him

143
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:22,642
to death,

144
00:04:22,642 --> 00:04:22,772
the sons

145
00:04:22,772 --> 00:04:22,902
of Shule

146
00:04:22,902 --> 00:04:23,032
crept into

147
00:04:23,032 --> 00:04:23,162
the house

148
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:23,292
of Noah by

149
00:04:23,292 --> 00:04:23,422
night and

150
00:04:23,422 --> 00:04:23,552
slew him,

151
00:04:23,552 --> 00:04:23,682
and broke

152
00:04:23,682 --> 00:04:23,812
down the

153
00:04:23,812 --> 00:04:23,942
door of the

154
00:04:23,942 --> 00:04:24,072
prison

155
00:04:24,072 --> 00:04:24,202
and brought

156
00:04:24,202 --> 00:04:24,332
out their

157
00:04:24,332 --> 00:04:24,462
father,

158
00:04:24,462 --> 00:04:24,592
and placed

159
00:04:24,592 --> 00:04:24,722
him upon

160
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:24,264
his throne in his own kingdom.

161
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:24,431
19

162
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:24,598
Wherefore, the

163
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:24,765
son of

164
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:24,932
Noah did

165
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:25,099
build up

166
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:25,266
his kingdom

167
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:25,433
in his

168
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:25,6
stead;

169
00:04:25,6 --> 00:04:25,767
nevertheless

170
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:25,934
they did

171
00:04:25,934 --> 00:04:26,101
not gain

172
00:04:26,101 --> 00:04:26,268
power

173
00:04:26,268 --> 00:04:26,435
any more

174
00:04:26,435 --> 00:04:26,602
over Shule

175
00:04:26,602 --> 00:04:26,769
the king,

176
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:26,936
and the

177
00:04:26,936 --> 00:04:27,103
people

178
00:04:27,103 --> 00:04:27,27
who were

179
00:04:27,27 --> 00:04:27,437
under the

180
00:04:27,437 --> 00:04:27,604
reign of

181
00:04:27,604 --> 00:04:27,771
Shule the

182
00:04:27,771 --> 00:04:27,938
king did

183
00:04:27,938 --> 00:04:28,105
prosper

184
00:04:28,105 --> 00:04:28,668
exceedingly and wax great.

185
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:29,239
20 And

186
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:29,81
the

187
00:04:29,81 --> 00:04:30,381
country was

188
00:04:30,381 --> 00:04:30,952
divided;

189
00:04:30,952 --> 00:04:31,523
and

190
00:04:31,523 --> 00:04:32,094
there were

191
00:04:32,094 --> 00:04:32,665
two

192
00:04:32,665 --> 00:04:33,236
kingdoms, the

193
00:04:33,236 --> 00:04:33,807
kingdom

194
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:34,378
of

195
00:04:34,378 --> 00:04:34,949
Shule, and

196
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:35,52
the

197
00:04:35,52 --> 00:04:36,091
kingdom of

198
00:04:36,091 --> 00:04:36,176
Cohor, the son of Noah.

199
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:36,0
21 And

200
00:04:36,0 --> 00:04:37,824
Cohor,

201
00:04:37,824 --> 00:04:38,648
the son

202
