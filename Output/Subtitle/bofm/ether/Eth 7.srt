00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:11,75
Chapter 7 Orihah reigns in righteousness—Amid

2
00:00:11,75 --> 00:00:23,5
 usurpation and strife, the rival kingdoms of Shule and

3
00:00:23,5 --> 00:00:35,25
 Cohor are set up—Prophets condemn the wickedness

4
00:00:35,25 --> 00:00:47,0
 and idolatry of the people, who then repent.

5
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:54,147
1 And it came to pass that Orihah did execute

6
00:00:54,147 --> 00:01:01,147
 judgment upon the land in righteousness all his days,

7
00:01:01,147 --> 00:01:08,147
 whose days were exceedingly many

8
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:11,602
2 And he begat sons and daughters; yea, he begat

9
00:01:11,602 --> 00:01:14,602
 thirty and one, among whom were twenty and three

10
00:01:14,602 --> 00:01:17,602
 sons

11
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:22,477
3 And it came to pass that he also begat Kib in

12
00:01:22,477 --> 00:01:27,477
 his old age. And it came to pass that Kib reigned in

13
00:01:27,477 --> 00:01:32,477
 his stead; and Kib begat Corihor

14
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:38,259
4 And when Corihor was thirty and two years old he

15
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:44,059
 rebelled against his father, and went over and

16
00:01:44,059 --> 00:01:49,859
 dwelt in the land of Nehor; and he begat sons and

17
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:55,659
 daughters, and they became exceedingly fair;

18
00:01:55,659 --> 00:02:01,459
 wherefore Corihor drew away many people after him

19
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:07,088
5 And when he had gathered together an army he

20
00:02:07,088 --> 00:02:12,288
 came up unto the land of Moron where the king dwelt,

21
00:02:12,288 --> 00:02:17,488
 and took him captive, which brought to pass the

22
00:02:17,488 --> 00:02:22,688
 saying of the brother of Jared that they would be

23
00:02:22,688 --> 00:02:27,888
 brought into captivity

24
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:33,214
6 Now the land of Moron, where the king dwelt, was

25
00:02:33,214 --> 00:02:38,547
 near the land which is called Desolation by the

26
00:02:38,547 --> 00:02:43,88
 Nephites

27
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:49,613
7 And it came to pass that Kib dwelt in captivity,

28
00:02:49,613 --> 00:02:55,863
 and his people under Corihor his son, until he

29
00:02:55,863 --> 00:03:02,113
 became exceedingly old; nevertheless Kib begat Shule

30
00:03:02,113 --> 00:03:08,363
 in his old age, while he was yet in captivity

31
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:13,772
8 And it came to pass that Shule was angry with

32
00:03:13,772 --> 00:03:19,022
 his brother; and Shule waxed strong, and became

33
00:03:19,022 --> 00:03:24,272
 mighty as to the strength of a man; and he was also

34
00:03:24,272 --> 00:03:29,522
 mighty in judgment

35
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:35,319
9 Wherefore, he came to the hill Ephraim, and he

36
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:41,462
 did molten out of the hill, and made swords out of

37
00:03:41,462 --> 00:03:47,605
 steel for those whom he had drawn away with him;

38
00:03:47,605 --> 00:03:53,748
 and after he had armed them with swords he returned

39
00:03:53,748 --> 00:03:59,891
 to the city Nehor, and gave battle unto his

40
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:06,034
 brother Corihor, by which means he obtained the kingdom

41
00:04:06,034 --> 00:04:12,177
 and restored it unto his father Kib

42
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:16,585
10 And now because of the thing which Shule had

43
00:04:16,585 --> 00:04:21,085
 done, his father bestowed upon him the kingdom;

44
00:04:21,085 --> 00:04:25,585
 therefore he began to reign in the stead of his

45
00:04:25,585 --> 00:04:30,085
 father

46
00:04:30,07 --> 00:04:35,82
11 And it came to pass that he did execute

47
00:04:35,82 --> 00:04:41,57
 judgment in righteousness; and he did spread his kingdom

48
00:04:41,57 --> 00:04:47,32
 upon all the face of the land, for the people had

49
00:04:47,32 --> 00:04:53,07
 become exceedingly numerous

50
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:58,027
12 And it came to pass that Shule also begat many

51
00:04:58,027 --> 00:05:02,527
 sons and daughters

52
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:07,969
13 And Corihor repented of the many evils which he

53
00:05:07,969 --> 00:05:13,302
 had done; wherefore Shule gave him power in his

54
00:05:13,302 --> 00:05:18,635
 kingdom

55
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:23,585
14 And it came to pass that Corihor had many sons

56
00:05:23,585 --> 00:05:28,585
 and daughters. And among the sons of Corihor there

57
00:05:28,585 --> 00:05:33,585
 was one whose name was Noah

58
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:40,016
15 And it came to pass that Noah rebelled against

59
00:05:40,016 --> 00:05:46,766
 Shule, the king, and also his father Corihor, and

60
00:05:46,766 --> 00:05:53,516
 drew away Cohor his brother, and also all his

61
00:05:53,516 --> 00:06:00,266
 brethren and many of the people

62
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:05,743
16 And he gave battle unto Shule, the king, in

63
00:06:05,743 --> 00:06:10,993
 which he did obtain the land of their first

64
00:06:10,993 --> 00:06:16,243
 inheritance; and he became a king over that part of the

65
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:21,493
 land

66
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:26,948
17 And it came to pass that he gave battle again

67
00:06:26,948 --> 00:06:32,281
 unto Shule, the king; and he took Shule, the king,

68
00:06:32,281 --> 00:06:37,614
 and carried him away captive into Moron

69
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:43,664
18 And it came to pass as he was about to put him

70
00:06:43,664 --> 00:06:49,664
 to death, the sons of Shule crept into the house

71
00:06:49,664 --> 00:06:55,664
 of Noah by night and slew him, and broke down the

72
00:06:55,664 --> 00:07:01,664
 door of the prison and brought out their father,

73
00:07:01,664 --> 00:07:07,664
 and placed him upon his throne in his own kingdom

74
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:14,494
19 Wherefore, the son of Noah did build up his

75
00:07:14,494 --> 00:07:21,094
 kingdom in his stead; nevertheless they did not gain

76
00:07:21,094 --> 00:07:27,694
 power any more over Shule the king, and the people

77
00:07:27,694 --> 00:07:34,294
 who were under the reign of Shule the king did

78
00:07:34,294 --> 00:07:40,894
 prosper exceedingly and wax great

79
00:07:40,66 --> 00:07:47,66
20 And the country was divided; and there were two

80
00:07:47,66 --> 00:07:54,66
 kingdoms, the kingdom of Shule, and the kingdom

81
00:07:54,66 --> 00:08:01,66
 of Cohor, the son of Noah

82
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:13,315
21 And Cohor, the son of Noah, caused that his

83
00:08:13,315 --> 00:08:24,648
 people should give battle unto Shule, in which Shule

84
00:08:24,648 --> 00:08:35,981
 did beat them and did slay Cohor

85
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:38,748
22 And now Cohor had a son who was called Nimrod;

86
00:08:38,748 --> 00:08:42,415
 and Nimrod gave up the kingdom of Cohor unto

87
00:08:42,415 --> 00:08:46,082
 Shule, and he did gain favor in the eyes of Shule;

88
00:08:46,082 --> 00:08:49,749
 wherefore Shule did bestow great favors upon him, and

89
00:08:49,749 --> 00:08:53,416
 he did do in the kingdom of Shule according to his

90
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:57,083
 desires

91
00:08:57,103 --> 00:09:04,103
23 And also in the reign of Shule there came

92
00:09:04,103 --> 00:09:11,103
 prophets among the people, who were sent from the Lord,

93
00:09:11,103 --> 00:09:18,103
 prophesying that the wickedness and idolatry of

94
00:09:18,103 --> 00:09:25,103
 the people was bringing a curse upon the land, and

95
00:09:25,103 --> 00:09:32,103
 they should be destroyed if they did not repent

96
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:36,505
24 And it came to pass that the people did revile

97
00:09:36,505 --> 00:09:40,705
 against the prophets, and did mock them. And it

98
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:44,905
 came to pass that king Shule did execute judgment

99
00:09:44,905 --> 00:09:49,105
 against all those who did revile against the

100
00:09:49,105 --> 00:09:53,305
 prophets

101
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:58,443
25 And he did execute a law throughout all the

102
00:09:58,443 --> 00:10:03,693
 land, which gave power unto the prophets that they

103
00:10:03,693 --> 00:10:08,943
 should go whithersoever they would; and by this

104
00:10:08,943 --> 00:10:14,193
 cause the people were brought unto repentance

105
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:19,114
26 And because the people did repent of their

106
00:10:19,114 --> 00:10:24,114
 iniquities and idolatries the Lord did spare them, and

107
00:10:24,114 --> 00:10:29,114
 they began to prosper again in the land. And it

108
00:10:29,114 --> 00:10:34,114
 came to pass that Shule begat sons and daughters in

109
00:10:34,114 --> 00:10:39,114
 his old age

110
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:40,405
27 And there were no more wars in the days of

111
00:10:40,405 --> 00:10:41,238
 Shule; and he remembered the great things that the

112
00:10:41,238 --> 00:10:42,071
 Lord had done for his fathers in bringing them across

113
00:10:42,071 --> 00:10:42,904
 the great deep into the promised land; wherefore

114
00:10:42,904 --> 00:10:43,737
 he did execute judgment in righteousness all his

115
00:10:43,737 --> 00:10:44,57
 days.
