00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 7 Orihah reigns in righteousnessâ€”Amid

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
usurpation and strife, the rival kingdoms of Shule

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and Cohor are set upâ€”Prophets condemn the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:04:43,
wickedness and idolatry of the people, who then repent. 

5
00:04:43,0 --> 00:04:43,0
1 And it came to pass that Orihah did

6
00:04:43,0 --> 00:04:43,0
execute judgment upon the land in righteousness

7
00:04:43,0 --> 00:08:13,
all his days, whose days were exceedingly many.

8
00:08:13,0 --> 00:08:13,0
2 And he begat sons and daughters;

9
00:08:13,0 --> 00:08:13,0
yea, he begat thirty and one,

10
00:08:13,0 --> 00:15:57,
among whom were twenty and three sons.

11
00:15:57,0 --> 00:15:57,0
3 And it came to pass that he

12
00:15:57,0 --> 00:15:57,0
also begat Kib in his old age. And

13
00:15:57,0 --> 00:15:57,0
it came to pass that Kib reigned

14
00:15:57,0 --> 00:19:42,
in his stead; and Kib begat Corihor.

15
00:19:42,0 --> 00:19:42,0
4 And when Corihor was thirty

16
00:19:42,0 --> 00:19:42,0
and two years old he rebelled

17
00:19:42,0 --> 00:19:42,0
against his father, and went

18
00:19:42,0 --> 00:19:42,0
over and dwelt in the land of

19
00:19:42,0 --> 00:19:42,0
Nehor; and he begat sons and

20
00:19:42,0 --> 00:19:42,0
daughters, and they became

21
00:19:42,0 --> 00:19:42,0
exceedingly fair; wherefore Corihor

22
00:19:42,0 --> 00:21:54,
drew away many people after him.

23
00:21:54,0 --> 00:21:54,0
5 And when he had gathered

24
00:21:54,0 --> 00:21:54,0
together an army he came up

25
00:21:54,0 --> 00:21:54,0
unto the land of Moron

26
00:21:54,0 --> 00:21:54,0
where the king dwelt, and took

27
00:21:54,0 --> 00:21:54,0
him captive, which brought

28
00:21:54,0 --> 00:21:54,0
to pass the saying of the

29
00:21:54,0 --> 00:21:54,0
brother of Jared that they

30
00:21:54,0 --> 00:30:50,
would be brought into captivity.

31
00:30:50,0 --> 00:30:50,0
6 Now the land of Moron,

32
00:30:50,0 --> 00:30:50,0
where the king dwelt, was

33
00:30:50,0 --> 00:30:50,0
near the land which is called

34
00:30:50,0 --> 00:32:02,
Desolation by the Nephites.

35
00:32:02,0 --> 00:32:02,0
7 And it came to pass

36
00:32:02,0 --> 00:32:02,0
that Kib dwelt in

37
00:32:02,0 --> 00:32:02,0
captivity, and his people under

38
00:32:02,0 --> 00:32:02,0
Corihor his son, until

39
00:32:02,0 --> 00:32:02,0
he became exceedingly

40
00:32:02,0 --> 00:32:02,0
old; nevertheless Kib begat

41
00:32:02,0 --> 00:32:02,0
Shule in his old age,

42
00:32:02,0 --> 00:38:13,
while he was yet in captivity.

43
00:38:13,0 --> 00:38:13,0
8 And it came to pass

44
00:38:13,0 --> 00:38:13,0
that Shule was angry

45
00:38:13,0 --> 00:38:13,0
with his brother; and

46
00:38:13,0 --> 00:38:13,0
Shule waxed strong, and

47
00:38:13,0 --> 00:38:13,0
became mighty as to the

48
00:38:13,0 --> 00:38:13,0
strength of a man; and he

49
00:38:13,0 --> 00:45:21,
was also mighty in judgment.

50
00:45:21,0 --> 00:45:21,0
9 Wherefore, he came

51
00:45:21,0 --> 00:45:21,0
to the hill Ephraim,

52
00:45:21,0 --> 00:45:21,0
and he did molten out of

53
00:45:21,0 --> 00:45:21,0
the hill, and made

54
00:45:21,0 --> 00:45:21,0
swords out of steel for

55
00:45:21,0 --> 00:45:21,0
those whom he had

56
00:45:21,0 --> 00:45:21,0
drawn away with him; and

57
00:45:21,0 --> 00:45:21,0
after he had armed them

58
00:45:21,0 --> 00:45:21,0
with swords he

59
00:45:21,0 --> 00:45:21,0
returned to the city Nehor,

60
00:45:21,0 --> 00:45:21,0
and gave battle unto

61
00:45:21,0 --> 00:45:21,0
his brother Corihor, by

62
00:45:21,0 --> 00:45:21,0
which means he

63
00:45:21,0 --> 00:45:21,0
obtained the kingdom and

64
00:45:21,0 --> 01:00:00,
restored it unto his father Kib.

65
01:00:00,0 --> 01:00:00,0
10 And now because of

66
01:00:00,0 --> 01:00:00,0
the thing which

67
01:00:00,0 --> 01:00:00,0
Shule had done, his

68
01:00:00,0 --> 01:00:00,0
father bestowed upon him

69
01:00:00,0 --> 01:00:00,0
the kingdom; therefore

70
01:00:00,0 --> 01:00:00,0
he began to reign in

71
01:00:00,0 --> 01:11:07,
the stead of his father.

72
01:11:07,0 --> 01:11:07,0
11 And it came to

73
01:11:07,0 --> 01:11:07,0
pass that he did

74
01:11:07,0 --> 01:11:07,0
execute judgment in

75
01:11:07,0 --> 01:11:07,0
righteousness; and he

76
01:11:07,0 --> 01:11:07,0
did spread his

77
01:11:07,0 --> 01:11:07,0
kingdom upon all the

78
01:11:07,0 --> 01:11:07,0
face of the land,

79
01:11:07,0 --> 01:11:07,0
for the people had

80
01:11:07,0 --> 01:13:19,
become exceedingly numerous.

81
01:13:19,0 --> 01:13:19,0
12 And it came to

82
01:13:19,0 --> 01:13:19,0
pass that Shule

83
01:13:19,0 --> 01:13:19,0
also begat many

84
01:13:19,0 --> 01:21:03,
sons and daughters.

85
01:21:03,0 --> 01:21:03,0
13 And Corihor

86
01:21:03,0 --> 01:21:03,0
repented of the

87
01:21:03,0 --> 01:21:03,0
many evils

88
01:21:03,0 --> 01:21:03,0
which he had done;

89
01:21:03,0 --> 01:21:03,0
wherefore

90
01:21:03,0 --> 01:21:03,0
Shule gave him

91
01:21:03,0 --> 01:33:58,
power in his kingdom.

92
01:33:58,0 --> 01:33:58,0
14 And it came

93
01:33:58,0 --> 01:33:58,0
to pass that

94
01:33:58,0 --> 01:33:58,0
Corihor had

95
01:33:58,0 --> 01:33:58,0
many sons and

96
01:33:58,0 --> 01:33:58,0
daughters. And

97
01:33:58,0 --> 01:33:58,0
among the sons

98
01:33:58,0 --> 01:33:58,0
of Corihor

99
01:33:58,0 --> 01:33:58,0
there was one

100
01:33:58,0 --> 01:40:08,
whose name was Noah.

101
01:40:08,0 --> 01:40:08,0
15 And it

102
01:40:08,0 --> 01:40:08,0
came to pass

103
01:40:08,0 --> 01:40:08,0
that Noah

104
01:40:08,0 --> 01:40:08,0
rebelled against

105
01:40:08,0 --> 01:40:08,0
Shule, the

106
01:40:08,0 --> 01:40:08,0
king, and also

107
01:40:08,0 --> 01:40:08,0
his father

108
01:40:08,0 --> 01:40:08,0
Corihor, and drew

109
01:40:08,0 --> 01:40:08,0
away Cohor

110
01:40:08,0 --> 01:40:08,0
his brother,

111
01:40:08,0 --> 01:40:08,0
and also all

112
01:40:08,0 --> 01:40:08,0
his brethren

113
01:40:08,0 --> 02:05:13,
and many of the people.

114
02:05:13,0 --> 02:05:13,0
16 And he

115
02:05:13,0 --> 02:05:13,0
gave battle

116
02:05:13,0 --> 02:05:13,0
unto Shule,

117
02:05:13,0 --> 02:05:13,0
the king, in

118
02:05:13,0 --> 02:05:13,0
which he did

119
02:05:13,0 --> 02:05:13,0
obtain the

120
02:05:13,0 --> 02:05:13,0
land of their

121
02:05:13,0 --> 02:05:13,0
first

122
02:05:13,0 --> 02:05:13,0
inheritance; and

123
02:05:13,0 --> 02:05:13,0
he became a

124
02:05:13,0 --> 02:05:13,0
king over

125
02:05:13,0 --> 02:07:25,
that part of the land.

126
02:07:25,0 --> 02:07:25,0
17 And it

127
02:07:25,0 --> 02:07:25,0
came to pass

128
02:07:25,0 --> 02:07:25,0
that he

129
02:07:25,0 --> 02:07:25,0
gave battle

130
02:07:25,0 --> 02:07:25,0
again unto

131
02:07:25,0 --> 02:07:25,0
Shule, the

132
02:07:25,0 --> 02:07:25,0
king; and he

133
02:07:25,0 --> 02:07:25,0
took

134
02:07:25,0 --> 02:07:25,0
Shule, the king,

135
02:07:25,0 --> 02:07:25,0
and

136
02:07:25,0 --> 02:07:25,0
carried him away

137
02:07:25,0 --> 02:10:07,
captive into Moron.

138
02:10:07,0 --> 02:10:07,0
18 And it

139
02:10:07,0 --> 02:10:07,0
came to

140
02:10:07,0 --> 02:10:07,0
pass as he

141
02:10:07,0 --> 02:10:07,0
was about

142
02:10:07,0 --> 02:10:07,0
to put him

143
02:10:07,0 --> 02:10:07,0
to death,

144
02:10:07,0 --> 02:10:07,0
the sons

145
02:10:07,0 --> 02:10:07,0
of Shule

146
02:10:07,0 --> 02:10:07,0
crept into

147
02:10:07,0 --> 02:10:07,0
the house

148
02:10:07,0 --> 02:10:07,0
of Noah by

149
02:10:07,0 --> 02:10:07,0
night and

150
02:10:07,0 --> 02:10:07,0
slew him,

151
02:10:07,0 --> 02:10:07,0
and broke

152
02:10:07,0 --> 02:10:07,0
down the

153
02:10:07,0 --> 02:10:07,0
door of the

154
02:10:07,0 --> 02:10:07,0
prison

155
02:10:07,0 --> 02:10:07,0
and brought

156
02:10:07,0 --> 02:10:07,0
out their

157
02:10:07,0 --> 02:10:07,0
father,

158
02:10:07,0 --> 02:10:07,0
and placed

159
02:10:07,0 --> 02:10:07,0
him upon

160
02:10:07,0 --> 02:14:20,
his throne in his own kingdom.

161
02:14:20,0 --> 02:14:20,0
19

162
02:14:20,0 --> 02:14:20,0
Wherefore, the

163
02:14:20,0 --> 02:14:20,0
son of

164
02:14:20,0 --> 02:14:20,0
Noah did

165
02:14:20,0 --> 02:14:20,0
build up

166
02:14:20,0 --> 02:14:20,0
his kingdom

167
02:14:20,0 --> 02:14:20,0
in his

168
02:14:20,0 --> 02:14:20,0
stead;

169
02:14:20,0 --> 02:14:20,0
nevertheless

170
02:14:20,0 --> 02:14:20,0
they did

171
02:14:20,0 --> 02:14:20,0
not gain

172
02:14:20,0 --> 02:14:20,0
power

173
02:14:20,0 --> 02:14:20,0
any more

174
02:14:20,0 --> 02:14:20,0
over Shule

175
02:14:20,0 --> 02:14:20,0
the king,

176
02:14:20,0 --> 02:14:20,0
and the

177
02:14:20,0 --> 02:14:20,0
people

178
02:14:20,0 --> 02:14:20,0
who were

179
02:14:20,0 --> 02:14:20,0
under the

180
02:14:20,0 --> 02:14:20,0
reign of

181
02:14:20,0 --> 02:14:20,0
Shule the

182
02:14:20,0 --> 02:14:20,0
king did

183
02:14:20,0 --> 02:14:20,0
prosper

184
02:14:20,0 --> 02:25:27,
exceedingly and wax great.

185
02:25:27,0 --> 02:25:27,0
20 And

186
02:25:27,0 --> 02:25:27,0
the

187
02:25:27,0 --> 02:25:27,0
country was

188
02:25:27,0 --> 02:25:27,0
divided;

189
02:25:27,0 --> 02:25:27,0
and

190
02:25:27,0 --> 02:25:27,0
there were

191
02:25:27,0 --> 02:25:27,0
two

192
02:25:27,0 --> 02:25:27,0
kingdoms, the

193
02:25:27,0 --> 02:25:27,0
kingdom

194
02:25:27,0 --> 02:25:27,0
of

195
02:25:27,0 --> 02:25:27,0
Shule, and

196
02:25:27,0 --> 02:25:27,0
the

197
02:25:27,0 --> 02:25:27,0
kingdom of

198
02:25:27,0 --> 02:30:37,
Cohor, the son of Noah.

199
02:30:37,0 --> 02:30:37,0
21 And

200
02:30:37,0 --> 02:30:37,0
Cohor,

201
02:30:37,0 --> 02:30:37,0
the son

202
02:30:37,0 --> 02:30:37,0
of

203
02:30:37,0 --> 02:30:37,0
Noah,

204
02:30:37,0 --> 02:30:37,0
caused that

205
02:30:37,0 --> 02:30:37,0
his

206
02:30:37,0 --> 02:30:37,0
people

207
02:30:37,0 --> 02:30:37,0
should

208
02:30:37,0 --> 02:30:37,0
give

209
02:30:37,0 --> 02:30:37,0
battle unto

210
02:30:37,0 --> 02:30:37,0
Shule,

211
02:30:37,0 --> 02:30:37,0
in

212
02:30:37,0 --> 02:30:37,0
which

213
02:30:37,0 --> 02:30:37,0
Shule did

214
02:30:37,0 --> 02:30:37,0
beat

215
02:30:37,0 --> 02:37:32,
them and did slay Cohor.

216
02:37:32,0 --> 02:37:32,0
22 And

217
02:37:32,0 --> 02:37:32,0
now

218
02:37:32,0 --> 02:37:32,0
Cohor had

219
02:37:32,0 --> 02:37:32,0
a son

220
02:37:32,0 --> 02:37:32,0
who was

221
02:37:32,0 --> 02:37:32,0
called

222
02:37:32,0 --> 02:37:32,0
Nimrod;

223
02:37:32,0 --> 02:37:32,0
and

224
02:37:32,0 --> 02:37:32,0
