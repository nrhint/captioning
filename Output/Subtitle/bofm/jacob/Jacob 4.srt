1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:03,5
Chapter 4 All the prophets worshiped the

2
00:00:03,5 --> 00:00:07,0
Father in the name of Christ—Abraham’s offering

3
00:00:07,0 --> 00:00:10,5
of Isaac was in similitude of God and His

4
00:00:10,5 --> 00:00:14,0
Only Begotten—Men should reconcile themselves

5
00:00:14,0 --> 00:00:17,5
to God through the Atonement—The Jews will

6
00:00:17,5 --> 00:00:21,321
reject the foundation stone. About 544–421 B.C. 

7
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:23,892
1 Now behold, it came to pass that I,

8
00:00:23,892 --> 00:00:26,463
Jacob, having ministered much unto my

9
00:00:26,463 --> 00:00:29,034
people in word, (and I cannot write

10
00:00:29,034 --> 00:00:31,605
but a little of my words, because of the

11
00:00:31,605 --> 00:00:34,176
difficulty of engraving our words

12
00:00:34,176 --> 00:00:36,747
upon plates) and we know that the things

13
00:00:36,747 --> 00:00:39,172
which we write upon plates must remain;

14
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:39,922
2 But whatsoever things we write

15
00:00:39,922 --> 00:00:40,672
upon anything save it be upon

16
00:00:40,672 --> 00:00:41,422
plates must perish and vanish away; but

17
00:00:41,422 --> 00:00:42,172
we can write a few words upon

18
00:00:42,172 --> 00:00:42,922
plates, which will give our children,

19
00:00:42,922 --> 00:00:43,672
and also our beloved brethren, a

20
00:00:43,672 --> 00:00:44,422
small degree of knowledge

21
00:00:44,422 --> 00:00:45,045
concerning us, or concerning their fathers—

22
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:45,845
3 Now in this thing we do

23
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:46,645
rejoice; and we labor diligently

24
00:00:46,645 --> 00:00:47,445
to engraven these words upon

25
00:00:47,445 --> 00:00:48,245
plates, hoping that our beloved

26
00:00:48,245 --> 00:00:49,045
brethren and our children will

27
00:00:49,045 --> 00:00:49,845
receive them with thankful

28
00:00:49,845 --> 00:00:50,645
hearts, and look upon them that

29
00:00:50,645 --> 00:00:51,445
they may learn with joy and

30
00:00:51,445 --> 00:00:52,245
not with sorrow, neither with

31
00:00:52,245 --> 00:00:53,487
contempt, concerning their first parents.

32
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:57,265
4 For, for this intent have

33
00:00:57,265 --> 00:01:01,043
we written these things, that

34
00:01:01,043 --> 00:01:04,821
they may know that we knew of

35
00:01:04,821 --> 00:01:08,599
Christ, and we had a hope of

36
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:12,377
his glory many hundred years

37
00:01:12,377 --> 00:01:16,155
before his coming; and not

38
00:01:16,155 --> 00:01:19,933
only we ourselves had a hope

39
00:01:19,933 --> 00:01:23,711
of his glory, but also all the

40
00:01:23,711 --> 00:01:27,788
holy prophets which were before us.

41
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:28,476
5 Behold, they believed in

42
00:01:28,476 --> 00:01:29,164
Christ and worshiped the

43
00:01:29,164 --> 00:01:29,852
Father in his name, and also

44
00:01:29,852 --> 00:01:30,54
we worship the Father in

45
00:01:30,54 --> 00:01:31,228
his name. And for this intent

46
00:01:31,228 --> 00:01:31,916
we keep the law of Moses,

47
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:32,604
it pointing our souls to

48
00:01:32,604 --> 00:01:33,292
him; and for this cause it is

49
00:01:33,292 --> 00:01:33,98
sanctified unto us for

50
00:01:33,98 --> 00:01:34,668
righteousness, even as it was

51
00:01:34,668 --> 00:01:35,356
accounted unto Abraham in

52
00:01:35,356 --> 00:01:36,044
the wilderness to be

53
00:01:36,044 --> 00:01:36,732
obedient unto the commands of God

54
00:01:36,732 --> 00:01:37,42
in offering up his son

55
00:01:37,42 --> 00:01:38,108
Isaac, which is a similitude of

56
00:01:38,108 --> 00:01:38,131
God and his Only Begotten Son.

57
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:38,714
6 Wherefore, we search

58
00:01:38,714 --> 00:01:39,297
the prophets, and we have

59
00:01:39,297 --> 00:01:39,88
many revelations and the

60
00:01:39,88 --> 00:01:40,463
spirit of prophecy; and

61
00:01:40,463 --> 00:01:41,046
having all these witnesses

62
00:01:41,046 --> 00:01:41,629
we obtain a hope, and our

63
00:01:41,629 --> 00:01:42,212
faith becometh unshaken,

64
00:01:42,212 --> 00:01:42,795
insomuch that we truly

65
00:01:42,795 --> 00:01:43,378
can command in the name of

66
00:01:43,378 --> 00:01:43,961
Jesus and the very trees

67
00:01:43,961 --> 00:01:44,544
obey us, or the

68
00:01:44,544 --> 00:01:45,138
mountains, or the waves of the sea.

69
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:46,388
7 Nevertheless, the

70
00:01:46,388 --> 00:01:47,638
Lord God showeth us our

71
00:01:47,638 --> 00:01:48,888
weakness that we may know

72
00:01:48,888 --> 00:01:50,138
that it is by his

73
00:01:50,138 --> 00:01:51,388
grace, and his great

74
00:01:51,388 --> 00:01:52,638
condescensions unto the

75
00:01:52,638 --> 00:01:53,888
children of men, that we

76
00:01:53,888 --> 00:01:55,482
have power to do these things.

77
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:56,944
8 Behold, great and

78
00:01:56,944 --> 00:01:58,406
marvelous are the works

79
00:01:58,406 --> 00:01:59,868
of the Lord. How

80
00:01:59,868 --> 00:02:01,33
unsearchable are the depths

81
00:02:01,33 --> 00:02:02,792
of the mysteries of

82
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:04,254
him; and it is

83
00:02:04,254 --> 00:02:05,716
impossible that man should

84
00:02:05,716 --> 00:02:07,178
find out all his ways.

85
00:02:07,178 --> 00:02:08,64
And no man knoweth of

86
00:02:08,64 --> 00:02:10,102
his ways save it be

87
00:02:10,102 --> 00:02:11,564
revealed unto him;

88
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:13,026
wherefore, brethren, despise

89
00:02:13,026 --> 00:02:14,901
not the revelations of God.

90
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:15,213
9 For behold, by the

91
00:02:15,213 --> 00:02:15,525
power of his word man

92
00:02:15,525 --> 00:02:15,837
came upon the face

93
00:02:15,837 --> 00:02:16,149
of the earth, which

94
00:02:16,149 --> 00:02:16,461
earth was created by

95
00:02:16,461 --> 00:02:16,773
the power of his word.

96
00:02:16,773 --> 00:02:17,085
Wherefore, if God

97
00:02:17,085 --> 00:02:17,397
being able to speak and

98
00:02:17,397 --> 00:02:17,709
the world was, and to

99
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:18,021
speak and man was

100
00:02:18,021 --> 00:02:18,333
created, O then, why

101
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:18,645
not able to command the

102
00:02:18,645 --> 00:02:18,957
earth, or the

103
00:02:18,957 --> 00:02:19,269
workmanship of his hands

104
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:19,581
upon the face of it,

105
00:02:19,581 --> 00:02:19,306
according to his will and pleasure?

106
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:22,706
10 Wherefore,

107
00:02:22,706 --> 00:02:26,106
brethren, seek not to

108
00:02:26,106 --> 00:02:29,506
counsel the Lord, but to

109
00:02:29,506 --> 00:02:32,906
take counsel from

110
00:02:32,906 --> 00:02:36,306
his hand. For behold,

111
00:02:36,306 --> 00:02:39,706
ye yourselves know

112
00:02:39,706 --> 00:02:43,106
that he counseleth

113
00:02:43,106 --> 00:02:46,506
in wisdom, and in

114
00:02:46,506 --> 00:02:49,906
justice, and in great

115
00:02:49,906 --> 00:02:53,607
mercy, over all his works.

116
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:54,975
11 Wherefore,

117
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:56,343
beloved brethren, be

118
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:57,711
reconciled unto him

119
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:59,079
through the atonement

120
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,447
of Christ, his

121
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:01,815
Only Begotten Son, and

122
00:03:01,815 --> 00:03:03,183
ye may obtain a

123
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,551
resurrection,

124
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:05,919
according to the power of

125
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,287
the resurrection

126
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:08,655
which is in Christ,

127
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,023
and be presented as

128
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,391
the first-fruits of

129
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:12,759
Christ unto God,

130
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,127
having faith, and

131
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,495
obtained a good hope

132
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:16,863
of glory in him

133
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,231
before he manifesteth

134
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:19,9
himself in the flesh.

135
00:03:19,9 --> 00:03:21,317
12 And now,

136
00:03:21,317 --> 00:03:22,734
beloved, marvel not that

137
00:03:22,734 --> 00:03:24,151
I tell you these

138
00:03:24,151 --> 00:03:25,568
things; for why

139
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,985
not speak of the

140
00:03:26,985 --> 00:03:28,402
atonement of Christ,

141
00:03:28,402 --> 00:03:29,819
and attain to a

142
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:31,236
perfect knowledge of

143
00:03:31,236 --> 00:03:32,653
him, as to attain

144
00:03:32,653 --> 00:03:34,07
to the knowledge

145
00:03:34,07 --> 00:03:35,487
of a resurrection

146
00:03:35,487 --> 00:03:36,316
and the world to come?

147
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:36,274
13 Behold, my

148
00:03:36,274 --> 00:03:36,232
brethren, he that

149
00:03:36,232 --> 00:03:36,19
prophesieth, let

150
00:03:36,19 --> 00:03:36,148
him prophesy to the

151
00:03:36,148 --> 00:03:36,106
understanding of

152
00:03:36,106 --> 00:03:36,064
men; for the

153
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,022
Spirit speaketh the

154
00:03:36,022 --> 00:03:35,98
truth and lieth

155
00:03:35,98 --> 00:03:35,938
not. Wherefore, it

156
00:03:35,938 --> 00:03:35,896
speaketh of

157
00:03:35,896 --> 00:03:35,854
things as they really

158
00:03:35,854 --> 00:03:35,812
are, and of

159
00:03:35,812 --> 00:03:35,77
things as they really

160
00:03:35,77 --> 00:03:35,728
will be;

161
00:03:35,728 --> 00:03:35,686
wherefore, these things

162
00:03:35,686 --> 00:03:35,644
are manifested

163
00:03:35,644 --> 00:03:35,602
unto us plainly,

164
00:03:35,602 --> 00:03:35,56
for the salvation

165
00:03:35,56 --> 00:03:35,518
of our souls. But

166
00:03:35,518 --> 00:03:35,476
behold, we are

167
00:03:35,476 --> 00:03:35,434
not witnesses alone

168
00:03:35,434 --> 00:03:35,392
in these things;

169
00:03:35,392 --> 00:03:35,35
for God also

170
00:03:35,35 --> 00:03:35,382
spake them unto prophets of old.

171
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:35,348
14 But behold,

172
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:35,314
the Jews were a

173
00:03:35,314 --> 00:03:35,28
stiffnecked

174
00:03:35,28 --> 00:03:35,246
people; and they

175
00:03:35,246 --> 00:03:35,212
despised the words

176
00:03:35,212 --> 00:03:35,178
of plainness, and

177
00:03:35,178 --> 00:03:35,144
killed the

178
00:03:35,144 --> 00:03:35,11
prophets, and sought

179
00:03:35,11 --> 00:03:35,076
for things that

180
00:03:35,076 --> 00:03:35,042
they could not

181
00:03:35,042 --> 00:03:35,008
understand.

182
00:03:35,008 --> 00:03:34,974
Wherefore, because

183
00:03:34,974 --> 00:03:34,94
of their

184
00:03:34,94 --> 00:03:34,906
blindness, which

185
00:03:34,906 --> 00:03:34,872
blindness came by

186
00:03:34,872 --> 00:03:34,838
looking beyond the

187
00:03:34,838 --> 00:03:34,804
mark, they must

188
00:03:34,804 --> 00:03:34,77
needs fall; for

189
00:03:34,77 --> 00:03:34,736
God hath taken

190
00:03:34,736 --> 00:03:34,702
away his plainness

191
00:03:34,702 --> 00:03:34,668
from them, and

192
00:03:34,668 --> 00:03:34,634
delivered unto

193
00:03:34,634 --> 00:03:34,6
them many things

194
00:03:34,6 --> 00:03:34,566
which they cannot

195
00:03:34,566 --> 00:03:34,532
understand,

196
00:03:34,532 --> 00:03:34,498
because they

197
00:03:34,498 --> 00:03:34,464
desired it. And

198
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:34,43
because they desired

199
00:03:34,43 --> 00:03:34,448
it God hath done it, that they may stumble.

200
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:34,515
15 And now I,

201
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:34,582
Jacob, am led on

202
00:03:34,582 --> 00:03:34,649
by the Spirit

203
00:03:34,649 --> 00:03:34,716
unto

204
00:03:34,716 --> 00:03:34,783
prophesying; for I

205
00:03:34,783 --> 00:03:34,85
perceive by the

206
00:03:34,85 --> 00:03:34,917
workings of the

207
00:03:34,917 --> 00:03:34,984
Spirit which is in

208
00:03:34,984 --> 00:03:35,051
me, that by the

209
00:03:35,051 --> 00:03:35,118
stumbling of

210
00:03:35,118 --> 00:03:35,185
the Jews they

211
00:03:35,185 --> 00:03:35,252
will reject the

212
00:03:35,252 --> 00:03:35,319
stone upon which

213
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:35,386
they might

214
00:03:35,386 --> 00:03:35,449
build and have safe foundation.

215
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:35,631
16 But

216
00:03:35,631 --> 00:03:35,813
behold, according

217
00:03:35,813 --> 00:03:35,995
to the

218
00:03:35,995 --> 00:03:36,177
scriptures, this

219
00:03:36,177 --> 00:03:36,359
stone shall

220
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:36,541
become the great,

221
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:36,723
and the

222
00:03:36,723 --> 00:03:36,905
last, and the

223
00:03:36,905 --> 00:03:37,087
only sure

224
00:03:37,087 --> 00:03:37,269
foundation, upon

225
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:37,384
which the Jews can build.

226
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:37,307
17 And now,

227
00:03:37,307 --> 00:03:37,23
my beloved,

228
00:03:37,23 --> 00:03:37,153
how is it

229
00:03:37,153 --> 00:03:37,076
possible that

230
00:03:37,076 --> 00:03:36,999
these, after

231
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:36,922
having

232
00:03:36,922 --> 00:03:36,845
rejected the

233
00:03:36,845 --> 00:03:36,768
sure

234
00:03:36,768 --> 00:03:36,691
foundation, can ever

235
00:03:36,691 --> 00:03:36,614
build upon

236
00:03:36,614 --> 00:03:36,537
it, that it

237
00:03:36,537 --> 00:03:36,46
may become the

238
00:03:36,46 --> 00:03:36,45
head of their corner?

239
00:03:36,45 --> 00:03:37,138
18 Behold,

240
00:03:37,138 --> 00:03:37,826
my beloved

241
00:03:37,826 --> 00:03:38,514
brethren, I

242
00:03:38,514 --> 00:03:39,202
will

243
00:03:39,202 --> 00:03:39,89
unfold this

244
00:03:39,89 --> 00:03:40,578
mystery unto

245
00:03:40,578 --> 00:03:41,266
you; if I do

246
00:03:41,266 --> 00:03:41,954
not, by any

247
00:03:41,954 --> 00:03:42,642
means, get

248
00:03:42,642 --> 00:03:43,33
shaken

249
00:03:43,33 --> 00:03:44,018
from my

250
00:03:44,018 --> 00:03:44,706
firmness in the

251
00:03:44,706 --> 00:03:45,394
Spirit, and

252
00:03:45,394 --> 00:03:46,082
stumble

253
00:03:46,082 --> 00:03:46,77
because of my

254
00:03:46,77 --> 00:03:47,861
over anxiety for you.
