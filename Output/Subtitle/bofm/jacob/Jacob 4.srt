00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,167
Chapter 4 All the prophets worshiped the Father in

2
00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:02,334
 the name of Christ—Abraham’s offering of Isaac

3
00:00:02,334 --> 00:00:03,501
 was in similitude of God and His Only Begotten—Men

4
00:00:03,501 --> 00:00:04,668
 should reconcile themselves to God through the

5
00:00:04,668 --> 00:00:05,835
 Atonement—The Jews will reject the foundation stone.

6
00:00:05,835 --> 00:00:07,002
 About 544–421 B.C.

7
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,308
1 Now behold, it came to pass that I, Jacob,

8
00:00:09,308 --> 00:00:10,641
 having ministered much unto my people in word, (and I

9
00:00:10,641 --> 00:00:11,974
 cannot write but a little of my words, because of

10
00:00:11,974 --> 00:00:13,307
 the difficulty of engraving our words upon plates)

11
00:00:13,307 --> 00:00:14,64
 and we know that the things which we write upon

12
00:00:14,64 --> 00:00:15,973
 plates must remain

13
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,282
2 But whatsoever things we write upon anything

14
00:00:17,282 --> 00:00:18,615
 save it be upon plates must perish and vanish away;

15
00:00:18,615 --> 00:00:19,948
 but we can write a few words upon plates, which

16
00:00:19,948 --> 00:00:21,281
 will give our children, and also our beloved

17
00:00:21,281 --> 00:00:22,614
 brethren, a small degree of knowledge concerning us, or

18
00:00:22,614 --> 00:00:23,947
 concerning their fathers

19
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,067
3 Now in this thing we do rejoice; and we labor

20
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:26,21
 diligently to engraven these words upon plates,

21
00:00:26,21 --> 00:00:27,353
 hoping that our beloved brethren and our children will

22
00:00:27,353 --> 00:00:28,496
 receive them with thankful hearts, and look upon

23
00:00:28,496 --> 00:00:29,639
 them that they may learn with joy and not with

24
00:00:29,639 --> 00:00:30,782
 sorrow, neither with contempt, concerning their first

25
00:00:30,782 --> 00:00:31,925
 parents

26
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:34,566
4 For, for this intent have we written these

27
00:00:34,566 --> 00:00:37,233
 things, that they may know that we knew of Christ, and

28
00:00:37,233 --> 00:00:39,9
 we had a hope of his glory many hundred years

29
00:00:39,9 --> 00:00:42,567
 before his coming; and not only we ourselves had a

30
00:00:42,567 --> 00:00:45,234
 hope of his glory, but also all the holy prophets

31
00:00:45,234 --> 00:00:47,901
 which were before us

32
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:52,292
5 Behold, they believed in Christ and worshiped

33
00:00:52,292 --> 00:00:56,736
 the Father in his name, and also we worship the

34
00:00:56,736 --> 00:01:01,18
 Father in his name. And for this intent we keep the

35
00:01:01,18 --> 00:01:05,624
 law of Moses, it pointing our souls to him; and for

36
00:01:05,624 --> 00:01:10,068
 this cause it is sanctified unto us for

37
00:01:10,068 --> 00:01:14,512
 righteousness, even as it was accounted unto Abraham in the

38
00:01:14,512 --> 00:01:18,956
 wilderness to be obedient unto the commands of God

39
00:01:18,956 --> 00:01:23,4
 in offering up his son Isaac, which is a

40
00:01:23,4 --> 00:01:27,844
 similitude of God and his Only Begotten Son

41
00:01:27,721 --> 00:02:04,15
6 Wherefore, we search the prophets, and we have

42
00:02:04,15 --> 00:02:40,579
 many revelations and the spirit of prophecy; and

43
00:02:40,579 --> 00:03:17,008
 having all these witnesses we obtain a hope, and our

44
00:03:17,008 --> 00:03:53,437
 faith becometh unshaken, insomuch that we truly

45
00:03:53,437 --> 00:04:29,866
 can command in the name of Jesus and the very trees

46
00:04:29,866 --> 00:05:06,295
 obey us, or the mountains, or the waves of the

47
00:05:06,295 --> 00:05:42,724
 sea

48
00:05:42,909 --> 00:07:04,659
7 Nevertheless, the Lord God showeth us our

49
00:07:04,659 --> 00:08:26,409
 weakness that we may know that it is by his grace, and

50
00:08:26,409 --> 00:09:48,159
 his great condescensions unto the children of men,

51
00:09:48,159 --> 00:11:09,909
 that we have power to do these things

52
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:13,869
8 Behold, great and marvelous are the works of the

53
00:11:13,869 --> 00:11:17,869
 Lord. How unsearchable are the depths of the

54
00:11:17,869 --> 00:11:21,869
 mysteries of him; and it is impossible that man should

55
00:11:21,869 --> 00:11:25,869
 find out all his ways. And no man knoweth of his

56
00:11:25,869 --> 00:11:29,869
 ways save it be revealed unto him; wherefore,

57
00:11:29,869 --> 00:11:33,869
 brethren, despise not the revelations of God

58
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:41,793
9 For behold, by the power of his word man came

59
00:11:41,793 --> 00:11:49,793
 upon the face of the earth, which earth was created

60
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:57,793
 by the power of his word. Wherefore, if God being

61
00:11:57,793 --> 00:12:05,793
 able to speak and the world was, and to speak and

62
00:12:05,793 --> 00:12:13,793
 man was created, O then, why not able to command

63
00:12:13,793 --> 00:12:21,793
 the earth, or the workmanship of his hands upon the

64
00:12:21,793 --> 00:12:29,793
 face of it, according to his will and pleasure

65
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:44,016
10 Wherefore, brethren, seek not to counsel the

66
00:12:44,016 --> 00:12:58,416
 Lord, but to take counsel from his hand. For behold,

67
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:12,816
 ye yourselves know that he counseleth in wisdom,

68
00:13:12,816 --> 00:13:27,216
 and in justice, and in great mercy, over all his

69
00:13:27,216 --> 00:13:41,616
 works

70
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:42,387
11 Wherefore, beloved brethren, be reconciled unto

71
00:13:42,387 --> 00:13:43,387
 him through the atonement of Christ, his Only

72
00:13:43,387 --> 00:13:44,387
 Begotten Son, and ye may obtain a resurrection,

73
00:13:44,387 --> 00:13:45,387
 according to the power of the resurrection which is in

74
00:13:45,387 --> 00:13:46,387
 Christ, and be presented as the first-fruits of

75
00:13:46,387 --> 00:13:47,387
 Christ unto God, having faith, and obtained a good

76
00:13:47,387 --> 00:13:48,387
 hope of glory in him before he manifesteth himself

77
00:13:48,387 --> 00:13:49,387
 in the flesh

78
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:52,562
12 And now, beloved, marvel not that I tell you

79
00:13:52,562 --> 00:13:55,762
 these things; for why not speak of the atonement of

80
00:13:55,762 --> 00:13:58,962
 Christ, and attain to a perfect knowledge of him,

81
00:13:58,962 --> 00:14:02,162
 as to attain to the knowledge of a resurrection

82
00:14:02,162 --> 00:14:05,362
 and the world to come

83
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,575
15 And now I, Jacob, am led on by the Spirit unto

84
00:00:09,575 --> 00:00:11,175
 prophesying; for I perceive by the workings of the

85
00:00:11,175 --> 00:00:12,775
 Spirit which is in me, that by the stumbling of

86
00:00:12,775 --> 00:00:14,375
 the Jews they will reject the stone upon which they

87
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:15,975
 might build and have safe foundation

88
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,949
16 But behold, according to the scriptures, this

89
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:19,949
 stone shall become the great, and the last, and the

90
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:21,949
 only sure foundation, upon which the Jews can

91
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:23,949
 build

92
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,924
17 And now, my beloved, how is it possible that

93
00:00:25,924 --> 00:00:27,924
 these, after having rejected the sure foundation,

94
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:29,924
 can ever build upon it, that it may become the head

95
00:00:29,924 --> 00:00:31,924
 of their corner

96
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,149
18 Behold, my beloved brethren, I will unfold this

97
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:34,399
 mystery unto you; if I do not, by any means, get

98
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:35,649
 shaken from my firmness in the Spirit, and stumble

99
00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:36,899
 because of my over anxiety for you.
