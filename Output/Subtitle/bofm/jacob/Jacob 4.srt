1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 4 All the prophets worshiped the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Father in the name of Christ—Abraham’s offering

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of Isaac was in similitude of God and His

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Only Begotten—Men should reconcile themselves

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
to God through the Atonement—The Jews will

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:11:42,
reject the foundation stone. About 544–421 B.C. 

7
00:11:42,0 --> 00:11:42,0
1 Now behold, it came to pass that I,

8
00:11:42,0 --> 00:11:42,0
Jacob, having ministered much unto my

9
00:11:42,0 --> 00:11:42,0
people in word, (and I cannot write

10
00:11:42,0 --> 00:11:42,0
but a little of my words, because of the

11
00:11:42,0 --> 00:11:42,0
difficulty of engraving our words

12
00:11:42,0 --> 00:11:42,0
upon plates) and we know that the things

13
00:11:42,0 --> 00:13:40,
which we write upon plates must remain;

14
00:13:40,0 --> 00:13:40,0
2 But whatsoever things we write

15
00:13:40,0 --> 00:13:40,0
upon anything save it be upon

16
00:13:40,0 --> 00:13:40,0
plates must perish and vanish away; but

17
00:13:40,0 --> 00:13:40,0
we can write a few words upon

18
00:13:40,0 --> 00:13:40,0
plates, which will give our children,

19
00:13:40,0 --> 00:13:40,0
and also our beloved brethren, a

20
00:13:40,0 --> 00:13:40,0
small degree of knowledge

21
00:13:40,0 --> 00:17:11,
concerning us, or concerning their fathers—

22
00:17:11,0 --> 00:17:11,0
3 Now in this thing we do

23
00:17:11,0 --> 00:17:11,0
rejoice; and we labor diligently

24
00:17:11,0 --> 00:17:11,0
to engraven these words upon

25
00:17:11,0 --> 00:17:11,0
plates, hoping that our beloved

26
00:17:11,0 --> 00:17:11,0
brethren and our children will

27
00:17:11,0 --> 00:17:11,0
receive them with thankful

28
00:17:11,0 --> 00:17:11,0
hearts, and look upon them that

29
00:17:11,0 --> 00:17:11,0
they may learn with joy and

30
00:17:11,0 --> 00:17:11,0
not with sorrow, neither with

31
00:17:11,0 --> 00:25:38,
contempt, concerning their first parents.

32
00:25:38,0 --> 00:25:38,0
4 For, for this intent have

33
00:25:38,0 --> 00:25:38,0
we written these things, that

34
00:25:38,0 --> 00:25:38,0
they may know that we knew of

35
00:25:38,0 --> 00:25:38,0
Christ, and we had a hope of

36
00:25:38,0 --> 00:25:38,0
his glory many hundred years

37
00:25:38,0 --> 00:25:38,0
before his coming; and not

38
00:25:38,0 --> 00:25:38,0
only we ourselves had a hope

39
00:25:38,0 --> 00:25:38,0
of his glory, but also all the

40
00:25:38,0 --> 00:25:10,
holy prophets which were before us.

41
00:25:10,0 --> 00:25:10,0
5 Behold, they believed in

42
00:25:10,0 --> 00:25:10,0
Christ and worshiped the

43
00:25:10,0 --> 00:25:10,0
Father in his name, and also

44
00:25:10,0 --> 00:25:10,0
we worship the Father in

45
00:25:10,0 --> 00:25:10,0
his name. And for this intent

46
00:25:10,0 --> 00:25:10,0
we keep the law of Moses,

47
00:25:10,0 --> 00:25:10,0
it pointing our souls to

48
00:25:10,0 --> 00:25:10,0
him; and for this cause it is

49
00:25:10,0 --> 00:25:10,0
sanctified unto us for

50
00:25:10,0 --> 00:25:10,0
righteousness, even as it was

51
00:25:10,0 --> 00:25:10,0
accounted unto Abraham in

52
00:25:10,0 --> 00:25:10,0
the wilderness to be

53
00:25:10,0 --> 00:25:10,0
obedient unto the commands of God

54
00:25:10,0 --> 00:25:10,0
in offering up his son

55
00:25:10,0 --> 00:25:10,0
Isaac, which is a similitude of

56
00:25:10,0 --> 00:24:42,
God and his Only Begotten Son.

57
00:24:42,0 --> 00:24:42,0
6 Wherefore, we search

58
00:24:42,0 --> 00:24:42,0
the prophets, and we have

59
00:24:42,0 --> 00:24:42,0
many revelations and the

60
00:24:42,0 --> 00:24:42,0
spirit of prophecy; and

61
00:24:42,0 --> 00:24:42,0
having all these witnesses

62
00:24:42,0 --> 00:24:42,0
we obtain a hope, and our

63
00:24:42,0 --> 00:24:42,0
faith becometh unshaken,

64
00:24:42,0 --> 00:24:42,0
insomuch that we truly

65
00:24:42,0 --> 00:24:42,0
can command in the name of

66
00:24:42,0 --> 00:24:42,0
Jesus and the very trees

67
00:24:42,0 --> 00:24:42,0
obey us, or the

68
00:24:42,0 --> 00:24:14,
mountains, or the waves of the sea.

69
00:24:14,0 --> 00:24:14,0
7 Nevertheless, the

70
00:24:14,0 --> 00:24:14,0
Lord God showeth us our

71
00:24:14,0 --> 00:24:14,0
weakness that we may know

72
00:24:14,0 --> 00:24:14,0
that it is by his

73
00:24:14,0 --> 00:24:14,0
grace, and his great

74
00:24:14,0 --> 00:24:14,0
condescensions unto the

75
00:24:14,0 --> 00:24:14,0
children of men, that we

76
00:24:14,0 --> 00:25:12,
have power to do these things.

77
00:25:12,0 --> 00:25:12,0
8 Behold, great and

78
00:25:12,0 --> 00:25:12,0
marvelous are the works

79
00:25:12,0 --> 00:25:12,0
of the Lord. How

80
00:25:12,0 --> 00:25:12,0
unsearchable are the depths

81
00:25:12,0 --> 00:25:12,0
of the mysteries of

82
00:25:12,0 --> 00:25:12,0
him; and it is

83
00:25:12,0 --> 00:25:12,0
impossible that man should

84
00:25:12,0 --> 00:25:12,0
find out all his ways.

85
00:25:12,0 --> 00:25:12,0
And no man knoweth of

86
00:25:12,0 --> 00:25:12,0
his ways save it be

87
00:25:12,0 --> 00:25:12,0
revealed unto him;

88
00:25:12,0 --> 00:25:12,0
wherefore, brethren, despise

89
00:25:12,0 --> 00:24:44,
not the revelations of God.

90
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
9 For behold, by the

91
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
power of his word man

92
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
came upon the face

93
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
of the earth, which

94
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
earth was created by

95
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
the power of his word.

96
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
Wherefore, if God

97
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
being able to speak and

98
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
the world was, and to

99
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
speak and man was

100
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
created, O then, why

101
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
not able to command the

102
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
earth, or the

103
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
workmanship of his hands

104
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
upon the face of it,

105
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:16,
according to his will and pleasure?

106
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
10 Wherefore,

107
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
brethren, seek not to

108
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
counsel the Lord, but to

109
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
take counsel from

110
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
his hand. For behold,

111
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
ye yourselves know

112
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
that he counseleth

113
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
in wisdom, and in

114
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
justice, and in great

115
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:30,
mercy, over all his works.

116
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
11 Wherefore,

117
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
beloved brethren, be

118
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
reconciled unto him

119
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
through the atonement

120
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
of Christ, his

121
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
Only Begotten Son, and

122
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
ye may obtain a

123
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
resurrection,

124
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
according to the power of

125
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
the resurrection

126
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
which is in Christ,

127
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
and be presented as

128
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
the first-fruits of

129
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
Christ unto God,

130
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
having faith, and

131
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
obtained a good hope

132
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
of glory in him

133
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
before he manifesteth

134
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:44,
himself in the flesh.

135
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
12 And now,

136
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
beloved, marvel not that

137
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
I tell you these

138
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
things; for why

139
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
not speak of the

140
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
atonement of Christ,

141
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
and attain to a

142
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
perfect knowledge of

143
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
him, as to attain

144
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
to the knowledge

145
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
of a resurrection

146
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:16,
and the world to come?

147
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
13 Behold, my

148
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
brethren, he that

149
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
prophesieth, let

150
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
him prophesy to the

151
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
understanding of

152
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
men; for the

153
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
Spirit speaketh the

154
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
truth and lieth

155
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
not. Wherefore, it

156
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
speaketh of

157
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
things as they really

158
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
are, and of

159
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
things as they really

160
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
will be;

161
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
wherefore, these things

162
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
are manifested

163
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
unto us plainly,

164
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
for the salvation

165
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
of our souls. But

166
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
behold, we are

167
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
not witnesses alone

168
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
in these things;

169
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
for God also

170
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:30,
spake them unto prophets of old.

171
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
14 But behold,

172
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
the Jews were a

173
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
stiffnecked

174
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
people; and they

175
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
despised the words

176
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
of plainness, and

177
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
killed the

178
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
prophets, and sought

179
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
for things that

180
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
they could not

181
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
understand.

182
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
Wherefore, because

183
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
of their

184
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
blindness, which

185
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
blindness came by

186
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
looking beyond the

187
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
mark, they must

188
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
needs fall; for

189
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
God hath taken

190
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
away his plainness

191
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
from them, and

192
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
delivered unto

193
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
them many things

194
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
which they cannot

195
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
understand,

196
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
because they

197
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
desired it. And

198
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
because they desired

199
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:44,
it God hath done it, that they may stumble.

200
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
15 And now I,

201
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
Jacob, am led on

202
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
by the Spirit

203
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
unto

204
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
prophesying; for I

205
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
perceive by the

206
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
workings of the

207
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
Spirit which is in

208
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
me, that by the

209
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
stumbling of

210
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
the Jews they

211
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
will reject the

212
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
stone upon which

213
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
they might

214
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:16,
build and have safe foundation.

215
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
16 But

216
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
behold, according

217
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
to the

218
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
scriptures, this

219
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
stone shall

220
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
become the great,

221
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
and the

222
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
last, and the

223
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
only sure

224
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:16,0
foundation, upon

225
00:24:16,0 --> 00:24:30,
which the Jews can build.

226
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
17 And now,

227
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
my beloved,

228
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
how is it

229
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
possible that

230
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
these, after

231
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
having

232
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
rejected the

233
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
sure

234
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
foundation, can ever

235
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
build upon

236
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
it, that it

237
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:30,0
may become the

238
00:24:30,0 --> 00:24:44,
head of their corner?

239
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
18 Behold,

240
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
my beloved

241
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
brethren, I

242
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
will

243
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
unfold this

244
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
mystery unto

245
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
you; if I do

246
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
not, by any

247
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
means, get

248
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
shaken

249
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
from my

250
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
firmness in the

251
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
Spirit, and

252
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
stumble

253
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:44,0
because of my

254
00:24:44,0 --> 00:24:16,
over anxiety for you.
