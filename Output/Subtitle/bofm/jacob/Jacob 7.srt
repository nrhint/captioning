00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,167
Chapter 7 Sherem denies Christ, contends with

2
00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:02,334
 Jacob, demands a sign, and is smitten of God—All of

3
00:00:02,334 --> 00:00:03,501
 the prophets have spoken of Christ and His

4
00:00:03,501 --> 00:00:04,668
 Atonement—The Nephites lived out their days as wanderers,

5
00:00:04,668 --> 00:00:05,835
 born in tribulation, and hated by the Lamanites.

6
00:00:05,835 --> 00:00:07,002
 About 544–421 B.C.

7
00:00:07,975 --> 00:01:41,308
1 And now it came to pass after some years had

8
00:01:41,308 --> 00:03:14,641
 passed away, there came a man among the people of

9
00:03:14,641 --> 00:04:47,974
 Nephi, whose name was Sherem

10
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:51,087
2 And it came to pass that he began to preach

11
00:04:51,087 --> 00:04:55,087
 among the people, and to declare unto them that there

12
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:59,087
 should be no Christ. And he preached many things

13
00:04:59,087 --> 00:05:03,087
 which were flattering unto the people; and this he

14
00:05:03,087 --> 00:05:07,087
 did that he might overthrow the doctrine of

15
00:05:07,087 --> 00:05:11,087
 Christ

16
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:28,411
3 And he labored diligently that he might lead

17
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:45,811
 away the hearts of the people, insomuch that he did

18
00:05:45,811 --> 00:06:03,211
 lead away many hearts; and he knowing that I,

19
00:06:03,211 --> 00:06:20,611
 Jacob, had faith in Christ who should come, he sought

20
00:06:20,611 --> 00:06:38,011
 much opportunity that he might come unto me

21
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:42,732
4 And he was learned, that he had a perfect

22
00:06:42,732 --> 00:06:46,732
 knowledge of the language of the people; wherefore, he

23
00:06:46,732 --> 00:06:50,732
 could use much flattery, and much power of speech,

24
00:06:50,732 --> 00:06:54,732
 according to the power of the devil

25
00:06:54,681 --> 00:07:06,11
5 And he had hope to shake me from the faith,

26
00:07:06,11 --> 00:07:17,539
 notwithstanding the many revelations and the many

27
00:07:17,539 --> 00:07:28,968
 things which I had seen concerning these things; for I

28
00:07:28,968 --> 00:07:40,397
 truly had seen angels, and they had ministered

29
00:07:40,397 --> 00:07:51,826
 unto me. And also, I had heard the voice of the Lord

30
00:07:51,826 --> 00:08:03,255
 speaking unto me in very word, from time to time;

31
00:08:03,255 --> 00:08:14,684
 wherefore, I could not be shaken

32
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:23,76
6 And it came to pass that he came unto me, and on

33
00:08:23,76 --> 00:08:33,093
 this wise did he speak unto me, saying: Brother

34
00:08:33,093 --> 00:08:42,426
 Jacob, I have sought much opportunity that I might

35
00:08:42,426 --> 00:08:51,759
 speak unto you; for I have heard and also know

36
00:08:51,759 --> 00:09:01,092
 that thou goest about much, preaching that which ye

37
00:09:01,092 --> 00:09:10,425
 call the gospel, or the doctrine of Christ

38
00:09:10,25 --> 00:09:15,583
7 And ye have led away much of this people that

39
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:20,916
 they pervert the right way of God, and keep not the

40
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:26,249
 law of Moses which is the right way; and convert

41
00:09:26,249 --> 00:09:31,582
 the law of Moses into the worship of a being which

42
00:09:31,582 --> 00:09:36,915
 ye say shall come many hundred years hence. And

43
00:09:36,915 --> 00:09:42,248
 now behold, I, Sherem, declare unto you that this is

44
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:47,581
 blasphemy; for no man knoweth of such things; for

45
00:09:47,581 --> 00:09:52,914
 he cannot tell of things to come. And after this

46
00:09:52,914 --> 00:09:58,247
 manner did Sherem contend against me

47
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,765
8 But behold, the Lord God poured in his Spirit

48
00:10:00,765 --> 00:10:03,432
 into my soul, insomuch that I did confound him in

49
00:10:03,432 --> 00:10:06,099
 all his words

50
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:27,822
9 And I said unto him: Deniest thou the Christ who

51
00:10:27,822 --> 00:10:49,572
 shall come? And he said: If there should be a

52
00:10:49,572 --> 00:11:11,322
 Christ, I would not deny him; but I know that there

53
00:11:11,322 --> 00:11:33,072
 is no Christ, neither has been, nor ever will be

54
00:11:33,793 --> 00:12:45,793
10 And I said unto him: Believest thou the

55
00:12:45,793 --> 00:13:57,793
 scriptures? And he said, Yea

56
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:32,337
11 And I said unto him: Then ye do not understand

57
00:14:32,337 --> 00:15:07,337
 them; for they truly testify of Christ. Behold, I

58
00:15:07,337 --> 00:15:42,337
 say unto you that none of the prophets have

59
00:15:42,337 --> 00:16:17,337
 written, nor prophesied, save they have spoken

60
00:16:17,337 --> 00:16:52,337
 concerning this Christ

61
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:55,978
12 And this is not all—it has been made manifest

62
00:16:55,978 --> 00:16:59,178
 unto me, for I have heard and seen; and it also has

63
00:16:59,178 --> 00:17:02,378
 been made manifest unto me by the power of the

64
00:17:02,378 --> 00:17:05,578
 Holy Ghost; wherefore, I know if there should be no

65
00:17:05,578 --> 00:17:08,778
 atonement made all mankind must be lost

66
00:00:07,975 --> 00:01:03,975
15 And it came to pass that when I, Jacob, had

67
00:01:03,975 --> 00:01:59,975
 spoken these words, the power of the Lord came upon

68
00:01:59,975 --> 00:02:55,975
 him, insomuch that he fell to the earth. And it

69
00:02:55,975 --> 00:03:51,975
 came to pass that he was nourished for the space of

70
00:03:51,975 --> 00:04:47,975
 many days

71
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:53,087
16 And it came to pass that he said unto the

72
00:04:53,087 --> 00:04:59,087
 people: Gather together on the morrow, for I shall die;

73
00:04:59,087 --> 00:05:05,087
 wherefore, I desire to speak unto the people

74
00:05:05,087 --> 00:05:11,087
 before I shall die

75
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:28,411
17 And it came to pass that on the morrow the

76
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:45,811
 multitude were gathered together; and he spake plainly

77
00:05:45,811 --> 00:06:03,211
 unto them and denied the things which he had

78
00:06:03,211 --> 00:06:20,611
 taught them, and confessed the Christ, and the power

79
00:06:20,611 --> 00:06:38,011
 of the Holy Ghost, and the ministering of angels

80
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:42,732
18 And he spake plainly unto them, that he had

81
00:06:42,732 --> 00:06:46,732
 been deceived by the power of the devil. And he spake

82
00:06:46,732 --> 00:06:50,732
 of hell, and of eternity, and of eternal

83
00:06:50,732 --> 00:06:54,732
 punishment

84
00:06:54,681 --> 00:07:08,014
19 And he said: I fear lest I have committed the

85
00:07:08,014 --> 00:07:21,347
 unpardonable sin, for I have lied unto God; for I

86
00:07:21,347 --> 00:07:34,68
 denied the Christ, and said that I believed the

87
00:07:34,68 --> 00:07:48,013
 scriptures; and they truly testify of him. And

88
00:07:48,013 --> 00:08:01,346
 because I have thus lied unto God I greatly fear lest my

89
00:08:01,346 --> 00:08:14,679
 case shall be awful; but I confess unto God

90
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:33,094
20 And it came to pass that when he had said these

91
00:08:33,094 --> 00:08:51,761
 words he could say no more, and he gave up the

92
00:08:51,761 --> 00:09:10,428
 ghost

93
00:09:10,25 --> 00:09:19,85
21 And when the multitude had witnessed that he

94
00:09:19,85 --> 00:09:29,45
 spake these things as he was about to give up the

95
00:09:29,45 --> 00:09:39,05
 ghost, they were astonished exceedingly; insomuch

96
00:09:39,05 --> 00:09:48,65
 that the power of God came down upon them, and they

97
00:09:48,65 --> 00:09:58,25
 were overcome that they fell to the earth

98
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,098
22 Now, this thing was pleasing unto me, Jacob,

99
00:10:00,098 --> 00:10:02,098
 for I had requested it of my Father who was in

100
00:10:02,098 --> 00:10:04,098
 heaven; for he had heard my cry and answered my prayer

101
00:10:04,098 --> 00:10:06,098


102
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:27,822
23 And it came to pass that peace and the love of

103
00:10:27,822 --> 00:10:49,572
 God was restored again among the people; and they

104
00:10:49,572 --> 00:11:11,322
 searched the scriptures, and hearkened no more to

105
00:11:11,322 --> 00:11:33,072
 the words of this wicked man

106
00:11:33,793 --> 00:12:19,364
24 And it came to pass that many means were

107
00:12:19,364 --> 00:13:04,935
 devised to reclaim and restore the Lamanites to the

108
00:13:04,935 --> 00:13:50,506
 knowledge of the truth; but it all was vain, for they

109
00:13:50,506 --> 00:14:36,077
 delighted in wars and bloodshed, and they had an

110
00:14:36,077 --> 00:15:21,648
 eternal hatred against us, their brethren. And they

111
00:15:21,648 --> 00:16:07,219
 sought by the power of their arms to destroy us

112
00:16:07,219 --> 00:16:52,79
 continually

113
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:55,978
25 Wherefore, the people of Nephi did fortify

114
00:16:55,978 --> 00:16:59,178
 against them with their arms, and with all their

115
00:16:59,178 --> 00:17:02,378
 might, trusting in the God and rock of their salvation;

116
00:17:02,378 --> 00:17:05,578
 wherefore, they became as yet, conquerors of

117
00:17:05,578 --> 00:17:08,778
 their enemies
