00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 7 Sherem denies Christ, contends

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
with Jacob, demands a sign, and is smitten of

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
God—All of the prophets have spoken of Christ

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and His Atonement—The Nephites lived out

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
their days as wanderers, born in tribulation,

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:04:43,
and hated by the Lamanites. About 544–421 B.C. 

7
00:04:43,0 --> 00:04:43,0
1 And now it came to pass after some years

8
00:04:43,0 --> 00:04:43,0
had passed away, there came a man among

9
00:04:43,0 --> 00:13:39,
the people of Nephi, whose name was Sherem.

10
00:13:39,0 --> 00:13:39,0
2 And it came to pass that he began to

11
00:13:39,0 --> 00:13:39,0
preach among the people, and to declare

12
00:13:39,0 --> 00:13:39,0
unto them that there should be no Christ.

13
00:13:39,0 --> 00:13:39,0
And he preached many things which were

14
00:13:39,0 --> 00:13:39,0
flattering unto the people; and this he did

15
00:13:39,0 --> 00:27:47,
that he might overthrow the doctrine of Christ.

16
00:27:47,0 --> 00:27:47,0
3 And he labored diligently that he

17
00:27:47,0 --> 00:27:47,0
might lead away the hearts of the people,

18
00:27:47,0 --> 00:27:47,0
insomuch that he did lead away many

19
00:27:47,0 --> 00:27:47,0
hearts; and he knowing that I, Jacob, had

20
00:27:47,0 --> 00:27:47,0
faith in Christ who should come, he sought

21
00:27:47,0 --> 00:29:59,
much opportunity that he might come unto me.

22
00:29:59,0 --> 00:29:59,0
4 And he was learned, that he had a

23
00:29:59,0 --> 00:29:59,0
perfect knowledge of the language of

24
00:29:59,0 --> 00:29:59,0
the people; wherefore, he could use

25
00:29:59,0 --> 00:29:59,0
much flattery, and much power of

26
00:29:59,0 --> 00:31:43,
speech, according to the power of the devil.

27
00:31:43,0 --> 00:31:43,0
5 And he had hope to shake me

28
00:31:43,0 --> 00:31:43,0
from the faith, notwithstanding the

29
00:31:43,0 --> 00:31:43,0
many revelations and the many

30
00:31:43,0 --> 00:31:43,0
things which I had seen concerning

31
00:31:43,0 --> 00:31:43,0
these things; for I truly had seen

32
00:31:43,0 --> 00:31:43,0
angels, and they had ministered

33
00:31:43,0 --> 00:31:43,0
unto me. And also, I had heard

34
00:31:43,0 --> 00:31:43,0
the voice of the Lord speaking unto

35
00:31:43,0 --> 00:31:43,0
me in very word, from time to

36
00:31:43,0 --> 00:33:13,
time; wherefore, I could not be shaken.

37
00:33:13,0 --> 00:33:13,0
6 And it came to pass that he

38
00:33:13,0 --> 00:33:13,0
came unto me, and on this wise did

39
00:33:13,0 --> 00:33:13,0
he speak unto me, saying:

40
00:33:13,0 --> 00:33:13,0
Brother Jacob, I have sought much

41
00:33:13,0 --> 00:33:13,0
opportunity that I might speak unto

42
00:33:13,0 --> 00:33:13,0
you; for I have heard and also

43
00:33:13,0 --> 00:33:13,0
know that thou goest about much,

44
00:33:13,0 --> 00:33:13,0
preaching that which ye call

45
00:33:13,0 --> 00:36:44,
the gospel, or the doctrine of Christ.

46
00:36:44,0 --> 00:36:44,0
7 And ye have led away much of

47
00:36:44,0 --> 00:36:44,0
this people that they pervert

48
00:36:44,0 --> 00:36:44,0
the right way of God, and keep

49
00:36:44,0 --> 00:36:44,0
not the law of Moses which is

50
00:36:44,0 --> 00:36:44,0
the right way; and convert the

51
00:36:44,0 --> 00:36:44,0
law of Moses into the worship of

52
00:36:44,0 --> 00:36:44,0
a being which ye say shall come

53
00:36:44,0 --> 00:36:44,0
many hundred years hence. And

54
00:36:44,0 --> 00:36:44,0
now behold, I, Sherem, declare

55
00:36:44,0 --> 00:36:44,0
unto you that this is

56
00:36:44,0 --> 00:36:44,0
blasphemy; for no man knoweth of such

57
00:36:44,0 --> 00:36:44,0
things; for he cannot tell of

58
00:36:44,0 --> 00:36:44,0
things to come. And after this

59
00:36:44,0 --> 00:40:14,
manner did Sherem contend against me.

60
00:40:14,0 --> 00:40:14,0
8 But behold, the Lord God

61
00:40:14,0 --> 00:40:14,0
poured in his Spirit into my

62
00:40:14,0 --> 00:40:14,0
soul, insomuch that I did

63
00:40:14,0 --> 00:43:45,
confound him in all his words.

64
00:43:45,0 --> 00:43:45,0
9 And I said unto him:

65
00:43:45,0 --> 00:43:45,0
Deniest thou the Christ

66
00:43:45,0 --> 00:43:45,0
who shall come? And he

67
00:43:45,0 --> 00:43:45,0
said: If there should be a

68
00:43:45,0 --> 00:43:45,0
Christ, I would not

69
00:43:45,0 --> 00:43:45,0
deny him; but I know that

70
00:43:45,0 --> 00:43:45,0
there is no Christ,

71
00:43:45,0 --> 00:43:17,
neither has been, nor ever will be.

72
00:43:17,0 --> 00:43:17,0
10 And I said unto him:

73
00:43:17,0 --> 00:43:17,0
Believest thou the

74
00:43:17,0 --> 00:50:46,
scriptures? And he said, Yea.

75
00:50:46,0 --> 00:50:46,0
11 And I said unto him:

76
00:50:46,0 --> 00:50:46,0
Then ye do not

77
00:50:46,0 --> 00:50:46,0
understand them; for they

78
00:50:46,0 --> 00:50:46,0
truly testify of Christ.

79
00:50:46,0 --> 00:50:46,0
Behold, I say unto you

80
00:50:46,0 --> 00:50:46,0
that none of the prophets

81
00:50:46,0 --> 00:50:46,0
have written, nor

82
00:50:46,0 --> 00:50:46,0
prophesied, save they have

83
00:50:46,0 --> 00:54:17,
spoken concerning this Christ.

84
00:54:17,0 --> 00:54:17,0
12 And this is not

85
00:54:17,0 --> 00:54:17,0
all—it has been made

86
00:54:17,0 --> 00:54:17,0
manifest unto me, for I

87
00:54:17,0 --> 00:54:17,0
have heard and seen;

88
00:54:17,0 --> 00:54:17,0
and it also has been

89
00:54:17,0 --> 00:54:17,0
made manifest unto

90
00:54:17,0 --> 00:54:17,0
me by the power of the

91
00:54:17,0 --> 00:54:17,0
Holy Ghost;

92
00:54:17,0 --> 00:54:17,0
wherefore, I know if there

93
00:54:17,0 --> 00:54:17,0
should be no atonement

94
00:54:17,0 --> 01:02:14,
made all mankind must be lost.

95
01:02:14,0 --> 01:02:14,0
13 And it came to

96
01:02:14,0 --> 01:02:14,0
pass that he said unto

97
01:02:14,0 --> 01:02:14,0
me: Show me a sign

98
01:02:14,0 --> 01:02:14,0
by this power of the

99
01:02:14,0 --> 01:02:14,0
Holy Ghost, in the

100
01:02:14,0 --> 01:03:44,
which ye know so much.

101
01:03:44,0 --> 01:03:44,0
14 And I said unto

102
01:03:44,0 --> 01:03:44,0
him: What am I that I

103
01:03:44,0 --> 01:03:44,0
should tempt God to

104
01:03:44,0 --> 01:03:44,0
show unto thee a

105
01:03:44,0 --> 01:03:44,0
sign in the thing

106
01:03:44,0 --> 01:03:44,0
which thou knowest to be

107
01:03:44,0 --> 01:03:44,0
true? Yet thou wilt

108
01:03:44,0 --> 01:03:44,0
deny it, because

109
01:03:44,0 --> 01:03:44,0
thou art of the devil.

110
01:03:44,0 --> 01:03:44,0
Nevertheless, not

111
01:03:44,0 --> 01:03:44,0
my will be done; but

112
01:03:44,0 --> 01:03:44,0
if God shall smite

113
01:03:44,0 --> 01:03:44,0
thee, let that be a

114
01:03:44,0 --> 01:03:44,0
sign unto thee that

115
01:03:44,0 --> 01:03:44,0
he has power, both in

116
01:03:44,0 --> 01:03:44,0
heaven and in

117
01:03:44,0 --> 01:03:44,0
earth; and also, that

118
01:03:44,0 --> 01:03:44,0
Christ shall come. And

119
01:03:44,0 --> 01:03:44,0
thy will, O Lord, be

120
01:03:44,0 --> 01:08:55,
done, and not mine.

121
01:08:55,0 --> 01:08:55,0
15 And it came to

122
01:08:55,0 --> 01:08:55,0
pass that when I,

123
01:08:55,0 --> 01:08:55,0
Jacob, had spoken

124
01:08:55,0 --> 01:08:55,0
these words, the power

125
01:08:55,0 --> 01:08:55,0
of the Lord came

126
01:08:55,0 --> 01:08:55,0
upon him, insomuch

127
01:08:55,0 --> 01:08:55,0
that he fell to the

128
01:08:55,0 --> 01:08:55,0
earth. And it came

129
01:08:55,0 --> 01:08:55,0
to pass that he was

130
01:08:55,0 --> 01:08:55,0
nourished for the

131
01:08:55,0 --> 01:08:27,
space of many days.

132
01:08:27,0 --> 01:08:27,0
16 And it came to

133
01:08:27,0 --> 01:08:27,0
pass that he said

134
01:08:27,0 --> 01:08:27,0
unto the people:

135
01:08:27,0 --> 01:08:27,0
Gather together on

136
01:08:27,0 --> 01:08:27,0
the morrow, for I

137
01:08:27,0 --> 01:08:27,0
shall die;

138
01:08:27,0 --> 01:08:27,0
wherefore, I desire to

139
01:08:27,0 --> 01:08:27,0
speak unto the

140
01:08:27,0 --> 01:08:13,
people before I shall die.

141
01:08:13,0 --> 01:08:13,0
17 And it came to

142
01:08:13,0 --> 01:08:13,0
pass that on the

143
01:08:13,0 --> 01:08:13,0
morrow the

144
01:08:13,0 --> 01:08:13,0
multitude were

145
01:08:13,0 --> 01:08:13,0
gathered together; and

146
01:08:13,0 --> 01:08:13,0
he spake plainly

147
01:08:13,0 --> 01:08:13,0
unto them and

148
01:08:13,0 --> 01:08:13,0
denied the things

149
01:08:13,0 --> 01:08:13,0
which he had taught

150
01:08:13,0 --> 01:08:13,0
them, and

151
01:08:13,0 --> 01:08:13,0
confessed the Christ,

152
01:08:13,0 --> 01:08:13,0
and the power of

153
01:08:13,0 --> 01:08:13,0
the Holy Ghost, and

154
01:08:13,0 --> 01:09:57,
the ministering of angels.

155
01:09:57,0 --> 01:09:57,0
18 And he spake

156
01:09:57,0 --> 01:09:57,0
plainly unto them,

157
01:09:57,0 --> 01:09:57,0
that he had been

158
01:09:57,0 --> 01:09:57,0
deceived by the

159
01:09:57,0 --> 01:09:57,0
power of the

160
01:09:57,0 --> 01:09:57,0
devil. And he spake

161
01:09:57,0 --> 01:09:57,0
of hell, and of

162
01:09:57,0 --> 01:09:57,0
eternity, and of

163
01:09:57,0 --> 01:15:08,
eternal punishment.

164
01:15:08,0 --> 01:15:08,0
19 And he said:

165
01:15:08,0 --> 01:15:08,0
I fear lest I

166
01:15:08,0 --> 01:15:08,0
have committed the

167
01:15:08,0 --> 01:15:08,0
unpardonable

168
01:15:08,0 --> 01:15:08,0
sin, for I have

169
01:15:08,0 --> 01:15:08,0
lied unto God; for

170
01:15:08,0 --> 01:15:08,0
I denied the

171
01:15:08,0 --> 01:15:08,0
Christ, and said

172
01:15:08,0 --> 01:15:08,0
that I believed

173
01:15:08,0 --> 01:15:08,0
the scriptures;

174
01:15:08,0 --> 01:15:08,0
and they truly

175
01:15:08,0 --> 01:15:08,0
testify of him.

176
01:15:08,0 --> 01:15:08,0
And because I have

177
01:15:08,0 --> 01:15:08,0
thus lied unto

178
01:15:08,0 --> 01:15:08,0
God I greatly

179
01:15:08,0 --> 01:15:08,0
fear lest my case

180
01:15:08,0 --> 01:15:08,0
shall be awful;

181
01:15:08,0 --> 01:20:36,
but I confess unto God.

182
01:20:36,0 --> 01:20:36,0
20 And it came

183
01:20:36,0 --> 01:20:36,0
to pass that

184
01:20:36,0 --> 01:20:36,0
when he had

185
01:20:36,0 --> 01:20:36,0
said these words

186
01:20:36,0 --> 01:20:36,0
he could say

187
01:20:36,0 --> 01:20:36,0
no more, and

188
01:20:36,0 --> 01:20:08,
he gave up the ghost.

189
01:20:08,0 --> 01:20:08,0
21 And when

190
01:20:08,0 --> 01:20:08,0
the multitude

191
01:20:08,0 --> 01:20:08,0
had witnessed

192
01:20:08,0 --> 01:20:08,0
that he

193
01:20:08,0 --> 01:20:08,0
spake these

194
01:20:08,0 --> 01:20:08,0
things as he was

195
01:20:08,0 --> 01:20:08,0
about to give

196
01:20:08,0 --> 01:20:08,0
up the ghost,

197
01:20:08,0 --> 01:20:08,0
they were

198
01:20:08,0 --> 01:20:08,0
astonished

199
01:20:08,0 --> 01:20:08,0
exceedingly;

200
01:20:08,0 --> 01:20:08,0
insomuch that the

201
01:20:08,0 --> 01:20:08,0
power of God

202
01:20:08,0 --> 01:20:08,0
came down

203
01:20:08,0 --> 01:20:08,0
upon them, and

204
01:20:08,0 --> 01:20:08,0
they were

205
01:20:08,0 --> 01:20:08,0
overcome that

206
01:20:08,0 --> 01:21:52,
they fell to the earth.

207
01:21:52,0 --> 01:21:52,0
22 Now, this

208
01:21:52,0 --> 01:21:52,0
thing was

209
01:21:52,0 --> 01:21:52,0
pleasing unto

210
01:21:52,0 --> 01:21:52,0
me, Jacob,

211
01:21:52,0 --> 01:21:52,0
for I had

212
01:21:52,0 --> 01:21:52,0
requested it

213
01:21:52,0 --> 01:21:52,0
of my Father

214
01:21:52,0 --> 01:21:52,0
who was in

215
01:21:52,0 --> 01:21:52,0
heaven; for

216
01:21:52,0 --> 01:21:52,0
he had heard

217
01:21:52,0 --> 01:21:52,0
my cry and

218
01:21:52,0 --> 01:23:36,
answered my prayer.

219
01:23:36,0 --> 01:23:36,0
23 And it

220
01:23:36,0 --> 01:23:36,0
came to pass

221
01:23:36,0 --> 01:23:36,0
that peace

222
01:23:36,0 --> 01:23:36,0
and the

223
01:23:36,0 --> 01:23:36,0
love of God

224
01:23:36,0 --> 01:23:36,0
was restored

225
01:23:36,0 --> 01:23:36,0
again

226
01:23:36,0 --> 01:23:36,0
among the

227
01:23:36,0 --> 01:23:36,0
people; and they

228
01:23:36,0 --> 01:23:36,0
searched

229
01:23:36,0 --> 01:23:36,0
the

230
01:23:36,0 --> 01:23:36,0
scriptures, and

231
01:23:36,0 --> 01:23:36,0
hearkened no

232
01:23:36,0 --> 01:23:36,0
more to the

233
01:23:36,0 --> 01:23:08,
words of this wicked man.

234
01:23:08,0 --> 01:23:08,0
24 And it

235
01:23:08,0 --> 01:23:08,0
came to

236
01:23:08,0 --> 01:23:08,0
pass that

237
01:23:08,0 --> 01:23:08,0
many means

238
01:23:08,0 --> 01:23:08,0
were

239
01:23:08,0 --> 01:23:08,0
devised to

240
01:23:08,0 --> 01:23:08,0
reclaim and

241
01:23:08,0 --> 01:23:08,0
restore the

242
01:23:08,0 --> 01:23:08,0
Lamanites

243
01:23:08,0 --> 01:23:08,0
to the

244
01:23:08,0 --> 01:23:08,0
knowledge of

245
01:23:08,0 --> 01:23:08,0
the truth;

246
01:23:08,0 --> 01:23:08,0
but it all

247
01:23:08,0 --> 01:23:08,0
was vain,

248
01:23:08,0 --> 01:23:08,0
for they

249
01:23:08,0 --> 01:23:08,0
delighted

250
01:23:08,0 --> 01:23:08,0
in wars

251
01:23:08,0 --> 01:23:08,0
and

252
01:23:08,0 --> 01:23:08,0
bloodshed, and

253
01:23:08,0 --> 01:23:08,0
they had an

254
01:23:08,0 --> 01:23:08,0
eternal

255
01:23:08,0 --> 01:23:08,0
hatred

256
01:23:08,0 --> 01:23:08,0
against us,

257
01:23:08,0 --> 01:23:08,0
their

258
01:23:08,0 --> 01:23:08,0
brethren. And they

259
01:23:08,0 --> 01:23:08,0
sought by

260
01:23:08,0 --> 01:23:08,0
the power

261
01:23:08,0 --> 01:23:08,0
of their

262
01:23:08,0 --> 01:26:39,
arms to destroy us continually.

263
01:26:39,0 --> 01:26:39,0
25

264
01:26:39,0 --> 01:26:39,0
Wherefore, the

265
01:26:39,0 --> 01:26:39,0
people of

266
01:26:39,0 --> 01:26:39,0
Nephi did

267
01:26:39,0 --> 01:26:39,0
fortify

268
01:26:39,0 --> 01:26:39,0
against them

269
01:26:39,0 --> 01:26:39,0
with their

270
01:26:39,0 --> 01:26:39,0
arms, and

271
01:26:39,0 --> 01:26:39,0
with all

272
01:26:39,0 --> 01:26:39,0
their

273
01:26:39,0 --> 01:26:39,0
might, trusting

274
01:26:39,0 --> 01:26:39,0
in the

275
01:26:39,0 --> 01:26:39,0
God and rock

276
01:26:39,0 --> 01:26:39,0
of their

277
01:26:39,0 --> 01:26:39,0
salvation;

278
01:26:39,0 --> 01:26:39,0


279
01:26:39,0 --> 01:26:39,0
wherefore, they

280
01:26:39,0 --> 01:26:39,0
became as

281
01:26:39,0 --> 01:26:39,0
yet,

282
01:26:39,0 --> 01:26:39,0
conquerors of

283
01:26:39,0 --> 01:28:09,
their enemies.

284
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
26 And it

285
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
came to

286
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
pass that

287
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
I,

288
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
Jacob, began

289
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
to be old;

290
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
and the

291
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
record of

292
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
this

293
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
people being

294
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
kept on

295
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
the other

296
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
plates

297
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
of Nephi,

298
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0


299
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
wherefore, I

300
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
conclude this

301
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
record,

302
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
declaring

303
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
that I

304
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
have

305
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
written

306
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
according to the

307
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
best of

308
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
my

309
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
knowledge, by

310
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
saying

311
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
that the

312
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
time passed

313
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
away with

314
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
us, and

315
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
also our

316
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
lives

317
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
passed away

318
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
like as

319
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
it were

320
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
unto us a

321
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
dream, we

322
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
being a

323
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
lonesome

324
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
and a

325
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
solemn

326
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
people,

327
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
wanderers, cast

328
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
out from

329
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0


330
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
Jerusalem, born in

331
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0


332
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
tribulation, in a

333
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0


334
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
wilderness, and

335
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
hated of

336
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
our

337
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
brethren, which

338
01:28:09,0 --> 01:28:09,0
caused

339
01:28:09,0 --> 01:27:55,
wars and contentions; wherefore, we did mourn out our days.

340
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
27 And

341
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
I, Jacob,

342
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
saw

343
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
that I must

344
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
soon go

345
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
down to

346
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
my

347
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
grave;

348
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
wherefore, I

349
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
said

350
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
unto my son

351
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
Enos:

352
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
Take

353
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
these

354
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
plates. And I

355
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
told him

356
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
the

357
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
things

358
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
which my

359
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
brother

360
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
Nephi had

361
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
commanded

362
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
me, and

363
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
he

364
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
promised

365
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
obedience

366
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
unto the

367
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0


368
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
commands. And I

369
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
make an

370
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
end of

371
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
my

372
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
writing upon

373
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
these

374
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
plates,

375
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
which

376
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
writing has

377
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
been

378
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
small; and

379
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
to the

380
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
reader I

381
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
bid

382
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
farewell,

383
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
hoping that

384
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:55,0
many of

385
01:27:55,0 --> 01:27:27,
my brethren may read my words. Brethren, adieu.
