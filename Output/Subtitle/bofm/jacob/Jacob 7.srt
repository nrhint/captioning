00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,167
Chapter 7 Sherem denies Christ, contends

2
00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:02,334
with Jacob, demands a sign, and is smitten of

3
00:00:02,334 --> 00:00:03,501
God—All of the prophets have spoken of Christ

4
00:00:03,501 --> 00:00:04,668
and His Atonement—The Nephites lived out

5
00:00:04,668 --> 00:00:05,835
their days as wanderers, born in tribulation,

6
00:00:05,835 --> 00:00:07,508
and hated by the Lamanites. About 544–421 B.C. 

7
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:22,175
1 And now it came to pass after some years

8
00:00:22,175 --> 00:00:36,841
had passed away, there came a man among

9
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:51,752
the people of Nephi, whose name was Sherem.

10
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:51,585
2 And it came to pass that he began to

11
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:51,418
preach among the people, and to declare

12
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:51,251
unto them that there should be no Christ.

13
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:51,084
And he preached many things which were

14
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:50,917
flattering unto the people; and this he did

15
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:50,817
that he might overthrow the doctrine of Christ.

16
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:50,65
3 And he labored diligently that he

17
00:00:50,65 --> 00:00:50,483
might lead away the hearts of the people,

18
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:50,316
insomuch that he did lead away many

19
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:50,149
hearts; and he knowing that I, Jacob, had

20
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:49,982
faith in Christ who should come, he sought

21
00:00:49,982 --> 00:00:49,883
much opportunity that he might come unto me.

22
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
4 And he was learned, that he had a

23
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
perfect knowledge of the language of

24
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
the people; wherefore, he could use

25
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
much flattery, and much power of

26
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
speech, according to the power of the devil.

27
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
5 And he had hope to shake me

28
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
from the faith, notwithstanding the

29
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
many revelations and the many

30
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
things which I had seen concerning

31
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
these things; for I truly had seen

32
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
angels, and they had ministered

33
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
unto me. And also, I had heard

34
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
the voice of the Lord speaking unto

35
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
me in very word, from time to

36
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
time; wherefore, I could not be shaken.

37
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
6 And it came to pass that he

38
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
came unto me, and on this wise did

39
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
he speak unto me, saying:

40
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
Brother Jacob, I have sought much

41
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
opportunity that I might speak unto

42
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
you; for I have heard and also

43
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
know that thou goest about much,

44
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
preaching that which ye call

45
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
the gospel, or the doctrine of Christ.

46
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
7 And ye have led away much of

47
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
this people that they pervert

48
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
the right way of God, and keep

49
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
not the law of Moses which is

50
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
the right way; and convert the

51
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
law of Moses into the worship of

52
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
a being which ye say shall come

53
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
many hundred years hence. And

54
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
now behold, I, Sherem, declare

55
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
unto you that this is

56
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
blasphemy; for no man knoweth of such

57
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
things; for he cannot tell of

58
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
things to come. And after this

59
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
manner did Sherem contend against me.

60
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
8 But behold, the Lord God

61
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
poured in his Spirit into my

62
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
soul, insomuch that I did

63
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
confound him in all his words.

64
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
9 And I said unto him:

65
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
Deniest thou the Christ

66
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
who shall come? And he

67
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
said: If there should be a

68
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
Christ, I would not

69
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
deny him; but I know that

70
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
there is no Christ,

71
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
neither has been, nor ever will be.

72
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
10 And I said unto him:

73
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
Believest thou the

74
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
scriptures? And he said, Yea.

75
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
11 And I said unto him:

76
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
Then ye do not

77
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
understand them; for they

78
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
truly testify of Christ.

79
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
Behold, I say unto you

80
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
that none of the prophets

81
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
have written, nor

82
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
prophesied, save they have

83
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
spoken concerning this Christ.

84
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
12 And this is not

85
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
all—it has been made

86
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
manifest unto me, for I

87
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
have heard and seen;

88
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
and it also has been

89
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
made manifest unto

90
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
me by the power of the

91
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
Holy Ghost;

92
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
wherefore, I know if there

93
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
should be no atonement

94
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
made all mankind must be lost.

95
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
13 And it came to

96
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
pass that he said unto

97
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
me: Show me a sign

98
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
by this power of the

99
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
Holy Ghost, in the

100
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
which ye know so much.

101
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
14 And I said unto

102
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
him: What am I that I

103
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
should tempt God to

104
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
show unto thee a

105
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
sign in the thing

106
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
which thou knowest to be

107
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
true? Yet thou wilt

108
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
deny it, because

109
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
thou art of the devil.

110
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
Nevertheless, not

111
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
my will be done; but

112
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
if God shall smite

113
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
thee, let that be a

114
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
sign unto thee that

115
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
he has power, both in

116
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
heaven and in

117
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
earth; and also, that

118
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
Christ shall come. And

119
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
thy will, O Lord, be

120
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
done, and not mine.

121
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
15 And it came to

122
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
pass that when I,

123
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
Jacob, had spoken

124
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
these words, the power

125
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
of the Lord came

126
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
upon him, insomuch

127
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
that he fell to the

128
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
earth. And it came

129
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
to pass that he was

130
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
nourished for the

131
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
space of many days.

132
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
16 And it came to

133
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
pass that he said

134
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
unto the people:

135
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
Gather together on

136
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
the morrow, for I

137
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
shall die;

138
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
wherefore, I desire to

139
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
speak unto the

140
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
people before I shall die.

141
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
17 And it came to

142
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
pass that on the

143
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
morrow the

144
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
multitude were

145
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
gathered together; and

146
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
he spake plainly

147
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
unto them and

148
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
denied the things

149
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
which he had taught

150
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
them, and

151
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
confessed the Christ,

152
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
and the power of

153
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
the Holy Ghost, and

154
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
the ministering of angels.

155
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
18 And he spake

156
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
plainly unto them,

157
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
that he had been

158
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
deceived by the

159
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
power of the

160
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
devil. And he spake

161
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
of hell, and of

162
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
eternity, and of

163
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
eternal punishment.

164
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
19 And he said:

165
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
I fear lest I

166
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
have committed the

167
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
unpardonable

168
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
sin, for I have

169
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
lied unto God; for

170
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
I denied the

171
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
Christ, and said

172
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
that I believed

173
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
the scriptures;

174
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
and they truly

175
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
testify of him.

176
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
And because I have

177
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
thus lied unto

178
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
God I greatly

179
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
fear lest my case

180
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
shall be awful;

181
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
but I confess unto God.

182
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
20 And it came

183
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
to pass that

184
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
when he had

185
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
said these words

186
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
he could say

187
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
no more, and

188
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
he gave up the ghost.

189
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
21 And when

190
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
the multitude

191
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
had witnessed

192
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
that he

193
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
spake these

194
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
things as he was

195
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
about to give

196
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
up the ghost,

197
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
they were

198
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
astonished

199
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
exceedingly;

200
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
insomuch that the

201
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
power of God

202
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
came down

203
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
upon them, and

204
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
they were

205
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
overcome that

206
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
they fell to the earth.

207
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
22 Now, this

208
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
thing was

209
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
pleasing unto

210
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
me, Jacob,

211
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
for I had

212
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
requested it

213
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
of my Father

214
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
who was in

215
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
heaven; for

216
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
he had heard

217
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
my cry and

218
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
answered my prayer.

219
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
23 And it

220
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
came to pass

221
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
that peace

222
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
and the

223
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
love of God

224
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
was restored

225
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
again

226
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
among the

227
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
people; and they

228
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
searched

229
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
the

230
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
scriptures, and

231
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
hearkened no

232
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
more to the

233
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
words of this wicked man.

234
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
24 And it

235
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
came to

236
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
pass that

237
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
many means

238
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
were

239
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
devised to

240
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
reclaim and

241
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
restore the

242
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
Lamanites

243
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
to the

244
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
knowledge of

245
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
the truth;

246
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
but it all

247
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
was vain,

248
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
for they

249
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
delighted

250
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
in wars

251
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
and

252
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
bloodshed, and

253
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
they had an

254
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
eternal

255
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
hatred

256
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
against us,

257
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
their

258
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
brethren. And they

259
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
sought by

260
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
the power

261
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
of their

262
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
arms to destroy us continually.

263
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
25

264
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
Wherefore, the

265
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
people of

266
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
Nephi did

267
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
fortify

268
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
against them

269
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
with their

270
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
arms, and

271
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
with all

272
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
their

273
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
might, trusting

274
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
in the

275
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
God and rock

276
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
of their

277
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
salvation;

278
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883


279
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
wherefore, they

280
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
became as

281
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
yet,

282
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
conquerors of

283
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
their enemies.

284
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
26 And it

285
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
came to

286
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
pass that

287
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
I,

288
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
Jacob, began

289
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
to be old;

290
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
and the

291
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
record of

292
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
this

293
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
people being

294
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
kept on

295
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
the other

296
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
plates

297
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
of Nephi,

298
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883


299
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
wherefore, I

300
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
conclude this

301
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
record,

302
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
declaring

303
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
that I

304
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
have

305
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
written

306
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
according to the

307
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
best of

308
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
my

309
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
knowledge, by

310
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
saying

311
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
that the

312
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
time passed

313
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
away with

314
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
us, and

315
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
also our

316
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
lives

317
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
passed away

318
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
like as

319
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
it were

320
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
unto us a

321
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
dream, we

322
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
being a

323
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
lonesome

324
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
and a

325
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
solemn

326
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
people,

327
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
wanderers, cast

328
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
out from

329
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883


330
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
Jerusalem, born in

331
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883


332
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
tribulation, in a

333
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883


334
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
wilderness, and

335
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
hated of

336
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
our

337
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
brethren, which

338
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
caused

339
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
wars and contentions; wherefore, we did mourn out our days.

340
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
27 And

341
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
I, Jacob,

342
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
saw

343
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
that I must

344
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
soon go

345
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
down to

346
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
my

347
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
grave;

348
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
wherefore, I

349
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
said

350
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
unto my son

351
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
Enos:

352
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
Take

353
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
these

354
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
plates. And I

355
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
told him

356
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
the

357
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
things

358
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
which my

359
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
brother

360
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
Nephi had

361
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
commanded

362
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
me, and

363
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
he

364
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
promised

365
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
obedience

366
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
unto the

367
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883


368
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
commands. And I

369
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
make an

370
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
end of

371
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
my

372
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
writing upon

373
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
these

374
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
plates,

375
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
which

376
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
writing has

377
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
been

378
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
small; and

379
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
to the

380
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
reader I

381
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
bid

382
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
farewell,

383
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
hoping that

384
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
many of

385
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:49,883
my brethren may read my words. Brethren, adieu.
