00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 5 Jacob quotes Zenos relative to the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
allegory of the tame and wild olive

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
trees—They are a likeness of Israel and the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Gentiles—The scattering and gathering of Israel are

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
prefigured—Allusions are made to the Nephites

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and Lamanites and all the house of Israel—The

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Gentiles will be grafted into

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:11:43,
Israel—Eventually the vineyard will be burned. About 544–421 B.C. 

9
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
1 Behold, my brethren, do ye not remember to

10
00:11:43,0 --> 00:11:43,0
have read the words of the prophet Zenos,

11
00:11:43,0 --> 00:18:52,
which he spake unto the house of Israel, saying:

12
00:18:52,0 --> 00:18:52,0
2 Hearken, O ye house of Israel, and

13
00:18:52,0 --> 00:33:58,
hear the words of me, a prophet of the Lord.

14
00:33:58,0 --> 00:33:58,0
3 For behold, thus saith the Lord, I

15
00:33:58,0 --> 00:33:58,0
will liken thee, O house of Israel, like

16
00:33:58,0 --> 00:33:58,0
unto a tame olive tree, which a man

17
00:33:58,0 --> 00:33:58,0
took and nourished in his vineyard; and it

18
00:33:58,0 --> 00:33:30,
grew, and waxed old, and began to decay.

19
00:33:30,0 --> 00:33:30,0
4 And it came to pass that the

20
00:33:30,0 --> 00:33:30,0
master of the vineyard went forth, and he

21
00:33:30,0 --> 00:33:30,0
saw that his olive tree began to

22
00:33:30,0 --> 00:33:30,0
decay; and he said: I will prune it,

23
00:33:30,0 --> 00:33:30,0
and dig about it, and nourish it,

24
00:33:30,0 --> 00:33:30,0
that perhaps it may shoot forth young

25
00:33:30,0 --> 00:34:42,
and tender branches, and it perish not.

26
00:34:42,0 --> 00:34:42,0
5 And it came to pass that he

27
00:34:42,0 --> 00:34:42,0
pruned it, and digged about it, and

28
00:34:42,0 --> 00:34:14,
nourished it according to his word.

29
00:34:14,0 --> 00:34:14,0
6 And it came to pass that after

30
00:34:14,0 --> 00:34:14,0
many days it began to put forth

31
00:34:14,0 --> 00:34:14,0
somewhat a little, young and

32
00:34:14,0 --> 00:34:14,0
tender branches; but behold, the

33
00:34:14,0 --> 00:33:46,
main top thereof began to perish.

34
00:33:46,0 --> 00:33:46,0
7 And it came to pass that the

35
00:33:46,0 --> 00:33:46,0
master of the vineyard saw

36
00:33:46,0 --> 00:33:46,0
it, and he said unto his

37
00:33:46,0 --> 00:33:46,0
servant: It grieveth me that I should

38
00:33:46,0 --> 00:33:46,0
lose this tree; wherefore, go

39
00:33:46,0 --> 00:33:46,0
and pluck the branches from a

40
00:33:46,0 --> 00:33:46,0
wild olive tree, and bring

41
00:33:46,0 --> 00:33:46,0
them hither unto me; and we will

42
00:33:46,0 --> 00:33:46,0
pluck off those main branches

43
00:33:46,0 --> 00:33:46,0
which are beginning to wither

44
00:33:46,0 --> 00:33:46,0
away, and we will cast them

45
00:33:46,0 --> 00:35:58,
into the fire that they may be burned.

46
00:35:58,0 --> 00:35:58,0
8 And behold, saith the Lord

47
00:35:58,0 --> 00:35:58,0
of the vineyard, I take

48
00:35:58,0 --> 00:35:58,0
away many of these young and

49
00:35:58,0 --> 00:35:58,0
tender branches, and I will

50
00:35:58,0 --> 00:35:58,0
graft them whithersoever I

51
00:35:58,0 --> 00:35:58,0
will; and it mattereth not that

52
00:35:58,0 --> 00:35:58,0
if it so be that the root

53
00:35:58,0 --> 00:35:58,0
of this tree will perish, I

54
00:35:58,0 --> 00:35:58,0
may preserve the fruit

55
00:35:58,0 --> 00:35:58,0
thereof unto myself; wherefore, I

56
00:35:58,0 --> 00:35:58,0
will take these young and

57
00:35:58,0 --> 00:35:58,0
tender branches, and I will

58
00:35:58,0 --> 00:35:30,
graft them whithersoever I will.

59
00:35:30,0 --> 00:35:30,0
9 Take thou the branches of

60
00:35:30,0 --> 00:35:30,0
the wild olive tree, and

61
00:35:30,0 --> 00:35:30,0
graft them in, in the stead

62
00:35:30,0 --> 00:35:30,0
thereof; and these which I

63
00:35:30,0 --> 00:35:30,0
have plucked off I will

64
00:35:30,0 --> 00:35:30,0
cast into the fire and burn

65
00:35:30,0 --> 00:35:30,0
them, that they may not

66
00:35:30,0 --> 00:37:00,
cumber the ground of my vineyard.

67
00:37:00,0 --> 00:37:00,0
10 And it came to pass

68
00:37:00,0 --> 00:37:00,0
that the servant of the

69
00:37:00,0 --> 00:37:00,0
Lord of the vineyard did

70
00:37:00,0 --> 00:37:00,0
according to the word of

71
00:37:00,0 --> 00:37:00,0
the Lord of the

72
00:37:00,0 --> 00:37:00,0
vineyard, and grafted in the

73
00:37:00,0 --> 00:41:29,
branches of the wild olive tree.

74
00:41:29,0 --> 00:41:29,0
11 And the Lord of the

75
00:41:29,0 --> 00:41:29,0
vineyard caused that it

76
00:41:29,0 --> 00:41:29,0
should be digged about,

77
00:41:29,0 --> 00:41:29,0
and pruned, and

78
00:41:29,0 --> 00:41:29,0
nourished, saying unto his

79
00:41:29,0 --> 00:41:29,0
servant: It grieveth me that I

80
00:41:29,0 --> 00:41:29,0
should lose this tree;

81
00:41:29,0 --> 00:41:29,0
wherefore, that perhaps

82
00:41:29,0 --> 00:41:29,0
I might preserve the

83
00:41:29,0 --> 00:41:29,0
roots thereof that they

84
00:41:29,0 --> 00:41:29,0
perish not, that I might

85
00:41:29,0 --> 00:41:29,0
preserve them unto myself,

86
00:41:29,0 --> 00:41:01,
I have done this thing.

87
00:41:01,0 --> 00:41:01,0
12 Wherefore, go thy

88
00:41:01,0 --> 00:41:01,0
way; watch the

89
00:41:01,0 --> 00:41:01,0
tree, and nourish it,

90
00:41:01,0 --> 00:40:33,
according to my words.

91
00:40:33,0 --> 00:40:33,0
13 And these will I

92
00:40:33,0 --> 00:40:33,0
place in the

93
00:40:33,0 --> 00:40:33,0
nethermost part of my

94
00:40:33,0 --> 00:40:33,0
vineyard,

95
00:40:33,0 --> 00:40:33,0
whithersoever I will, it

96
00:40:33,0 --> 00:40:33,0
mattereth not unto thee;

97
00:40:33,0 --> 00:40:33,0
and I do it that I

98
00:40:33,0 --> 00:40:33,0
may preserve unto

99
00:40:33,0 --> 00:40:33,0
myself the natural

100
00:40:33,0 --> 00:40:33,0
branches of the

101
00:40:33,0 --> 00:40:33,0
tree; and also, that I

102
00:40:33,0 --> 00:40:33,0
may lay up fruit

103
00:40:33,0 --> 00:40:33,0
thereof against the

104
00:40:33,0 --> 00:40:33,0
season, unto

105
00:40:33,0 --> 00:40:33,0
myself; for it grieveth

106
00:40:33,0 --> 00:40:33,0
me that I should

107
00:40:33,0 --> 00:44:46,
lose this tree and the fruit thereof.

108
00:44:46,0 --> 00:44:46,0
14 And it came to

109
00:44:46,0 --> 00:44:46,0
pass that the Lord

110
00:44:46,0 --> 00:44:46,0
of the vineyard went

111
00:44:46,0 --> 00:44:46,0
his way, and hid

112
00:44:46,0 --> 00:44:46,0
the natural branches

113
00:44:46,0 --> 00:44:46,0
of the tame olive

114
00:44:46,0 --> 00:44:46,0
tree in the

115
00:44:46,0 --> 00:44:46,0
nethermost parts of the

116
00:44:46,0 --> 00:44:46,0
vineyard, some in one

117
00:44:46,0 --> 00:44:46,0
and some in

118
00:44:46,0 --> 00:44:46,0
another, according to his

119
00:44:46,0 --> 00:44:18,
will and pleasure.

120
00:44:18,0 --> 00:44:18,0
15 And it came to

121
00:44:18,0 --> 00:44:18,0
pass that a long

122
00:44:18,0 --> 00:44:18,0
time passed

123
00:44:18,0 --> 00:44:18,0
away, and the Lord of

124
00:44:18,0 --> 00:44:18,0
the vineyard

125
00:44:18,0 --> 00:44:18,0
said unto his

126
00:44:18,0 --> 00:44:18,0
servant: Come, let us

127
00:44:18,0 --> 00:44:18,0
go down into the

128
00:44:18,0 --> 00:44:18,0
vineyard, that we

129
00:44:18,0 --> 00:45:48,
may labor in the vineyard.

130
00:45:48,0 --> 00:45:48,0
16 And it came

131
00:45:48,0 --> 00:45:48,0
to pass that the

132
00:45:48,0 --> 00:45:48,0
Lord of the

133
00:45:48,0 --> 00:45:48,0
vineyard, and also

134
00:45:48,0 --> 00:45:48,0
the servant, went

135
00:45:48,0 --> 00:45:48,0
down into the

136
00:45:48,0 --> 00:45:48,0
vineyard to

137
00:45:48,0 --> 00:45:48,0
labor. And it came to

138
00:45:48,0 --> 00:45:48,0
pass that the

139
00:45:48,0 --> 00:45:48,0
servant said unto

140
00:45:48,0 --> 00:45:48,0
his master:

141
00:45:48,0 --> 00:45:48,0
Behold, look here;

142
00:45:48,0 --> 00:49:19,
behold the tree.

143
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
17 And it came

144
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
to pass that

145
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
the Lord of the

146
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
vineyard looked

147
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
and beheld the

148
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
tree in the

149
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
which the wild

150
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
olive branches had

151
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
been grafted;

152
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
and it had

153
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
sprung forth and

154
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
begun to bear

155
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
fruit. And he

156
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
beheld that it was

157
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
good; and the

158
00:49:19,0 --> 00:49:19,0
fruit thereof

159
00:49:19,0 --> 00:54:01,
was like unto the natural fruit.

160
00:54:01,0 --> 00:54:01,0
18 And he said

161
00:54:01,0 --> 00:54:01,0
unto the

162
00:54:01,0 --> 00:54:01,0
servant: Behold,

163
00:54:01,0 --> 00:54:01,0
the branches of

164
00:54:01,0 --> 00:54:01,0
the wild tree

165
00:54:01,0 --> 00:54:01,0
have taken

166
00:54:01,0 --> 00:54:01,0
hold of the

167
00:54:01,0 --> 00:54:01,0
moisture of the

168
00:54:01,0 --> 00:54:01,0
root thereof,

169
00:54:01,0 --> 00:54:01,0
that the root

170
00:54:01,0 --> 00:54:01,0
thereof hath

171
00:54:01,0 --> 00:54:01,0
brought forth

172
00:54:01,0 --> 00:54:01,0
much strength;

173
00:54:01,0 --> 00:54:01,0
and because of

174
00:54:01,0 --> 00:54:01,0
the much

175
00:54:01,0 --> 00:54:01,0
strength of the root

176
00:54:01,0 --> 00:54:01,0
thereof the

177
00:54:01,0 --> 00:54:01,0
wild branches

178
00:54:01,0 --> 00:54:01,0
have brought

179
00:54:01,0 --> 00:54:01,0
forth tame

180
00:54:01,0 --> 00:54:01,0
fruit. Now, if we

181
00:54:01,0 --> 00:54:01,0
had not grafted

182
00:54:01,0 --> 00:54:01,0
in these

183
00:54:01,0 --> 00:54:01,0
branches, the tree

184
00:54:01,0 --> 00:54:01,0
thereof would

185
00:54:01,0 --> 00:54:01,0
have

186
00:54:01,0 --> 00:54:01,0
perished. And now,

187
00:54:01,0 --> 00:54:01,0
behold, I shall

188
00:54:01,0 --> 00:54:01,0
lay up much

189
00:54:01,0 --> 00:54:01,0
fruit, which the

190
00:54:01,0 --> 00:54:01,0
tree thereof

191
00:54:01,0 --> 00:54:01,0
hath brought

192
00:54:01,0 --> 00:54:01,0
forth; and the

193
00:54:01,0 --> 00:54:01,0
fruit thereof I

194
00:54:01,0 --> 00:54:01,0
shall lay up

195
00:54:01,0 --> 00:59:58,
against the season, unto mine own self.

196
00:59:58,0 --> 00:59:58,0
19 And it

197
00:59:58,0 --> 00:59:58,0
came to pass

198
00:59:58,0 --> 00:59:58,0
that the Lord of

199
00:59:58,0 --> 00:59:58,0
the vineyard

200
00:59:58,0 --> 00:59:58,0
said unto

201
00:59:58,0 --> 00:59:58,0
the servant:

202
00:59:58,0 --> 00:59:58,0
Come, let us go

203
00:59:58,0 --> 00:59:58,0
to the

204
00:59:58,0 --> 00:59:58,0
nethermost part of

205
00:59:58,0 --> 00:59:58,0
the

206
00:59:58,0 --> 00:59:58,0
vineyard, and behold

207
00:59:58,0 --> 00:59:58,0
if the

208
00:59:58,0 --> 00:59:58,0
natural branches of

209
00:59:58,0 --> 00:59:58,0
the tree

210
00:59:58,0 --> 00:59:58,0
have not brought

211
00:59:58,0 --> 00:59:58,0
forth much

212
00:59:58,0 --> 00:59:58,0
fruit also,

213
00:59:58,0 --> 00:59:58,0
that I may lay

214
00:59:58,0 --> 00:59:58,0
up of the

215
00:59:58,0 --> 00:59:58,0
fruit thereof

216
00:59:58,0 --> 00:59:58,0
against the

217
00:59:58,0 --> 01:00:56,
season, unto mine own self.

218
01:00:56,0 --> 01:00:56,0
20 And it

219
01:00:56,0 --> 01:00:56,0
came to pass

220
01:00:56,0 --> 01:00:56,0
that they

221
01:00:56,0 --> 01:00:56,0
went forth

222
01:00:56,0 --> 01:00:56,0
whither the

223
01:00:56,0 --> 01:00:56,0
master had hid

224
01:00:56,0 --> 01:00:56,0
the natural

225
01:00:56,0 --> 01:00:56,0
branches of

226
01:00:56,0 --> 01:00:56,0
the tree, and

227
01:00:56,0 --> 01:00:56,0
he said

228
01:00:56,0 --> 01:00:56,0
unto the

229
01:00:56,0 --> 01:00:56,0
servant: Behold

230
01:00:56,0 --> 01:00:56,0
these; and he

231
01:00:56,0 --> 01:00:56,0
beheld the

232
01:00:56,0 --> 01:00:56,0
first that it

233
01:00:56,0 --> 01:00:56,0
had brought

234
01:00:56,0 --> 01:00:56,0
forth much

235
01:00:56,0 --> 01:00:56,0
fruit; and

236
01:00:56,0 --> 01:00:56,0
he beheld

237
01:00:56,0 --> 01:00:56,0
also that it

238
01:00:56,0 --> 01:00:56,0
was good. And

239
01:00:56,0 --> 01:00:56,0
he said unto

240
01:00:56,0 --> 01:00:56,0
the

241
01:00:56,0 --> 01:00:56,0
servant: Take of

242
01:00:56,0 --> 01:00:56,0
the fruit

243
01:00:56,0 --> 01:00:56,0
thereof, and lay

244
01:00:56,0 --> 01:00:56,0
it up

245
01:00:56,0 --> 01:00:56,0
against the

246
01:00:56,0 --> 01:00:56,0
season, that I

247
01:00:56,0 --> 01:00:56,0
may preserve

248
01:00:56,0 --> 01:00:56,0
it unto mine

249
01:00:56,0 --> 01:00:56,0
own self;

250
01:00:56,0 --> 01:00:56,0
for behold,

251
01:00:56,0 --> 01:00:56,0
said he, this

252
01:00:56,0 --> 01:00:56,0
long time

253
01:00:56,0 --> 01:00:56,0
have I

254
01:00:56,0 --> 01:04:41,
nourished it, and it hath brought forth much fruit.

255
01:04:41,0 --> 01:04:41,0
21 And it

256
01:04:41,0 --> 01:04:41,0
came to pass

257
01:04:41,0 --> 01:04:41,0
that the

258
01:04:41,0 --> 01:04:41,0
servant said

259
01:04:41,0 --> 01:04:41,0
unto his

260
01:04:41,0 --> 01:04:41,0
master: How

261
01:04:41,0 --> 01:04:41,0
comest thou

262
01:04:41,0 --> 01:04:41,0
hither to

263
01:04:41,0 --> 01:04:41,0
plant this

264
01:04:41,0 --> 01:04:41,0
tree, or

265
01:04:41,0 --> 01:04:41,0
this branch

266
01:04:41,0 --> 01:04:41,0
of the tree?

267
01:04:41,0 --> 01:04:41,0
For

268
01:04:41,0 --> 01:04:41,0
behold, it was

269
01:04:41,0 --> 01:04:41,0
the poorest

270
01:04:41,0 --> 01:04:41,0
spot in all

271
01:04:41,0 --> 01:12:38,
the land of thy vineyard.

272
01:12:38,0 --> 01:12:38,0
22 And the

273
01:12:38,0 --> 01:12:38,0
Lord of

274
01:12:38,0 --> 01:12:38,0
the

275
01:12:38,0 --> 01:12:38,0
vineyard said

276
01:12:38,0 --> 01:12:38,0
unto him:

277
01:12:38,0 --> 01:12:38,0
Counsel me

278
01:12:38,0 --> 01:12:38,0
not; I knew

279
01:12:38,0 --> 01:12:38,0
that it

280
01:12:38,0 --> 01:12:38,0
was a poor

281
01:12:38,0 --> 01:12:38,0
spot of

282
01:12:38,0 --> 01:12:38,0
ground;

283
01:12:38,0 --> 01:12:38,0
wherefore, I

284
01:12:38,0 --> 01:12:38,0
said unto

285
01:12:38,0 --> 01:12:38,0
thee, I have

286
01:12:38,0 --> 01:12:38,0
nourished

287
01:12:38,0 --> 01:12:38,0
it this

288
01:12:38,0 --> 01:12:38,0
long time,

289
01:12:38,0 --> 01:12:38,0
and thou

290
01:12:38,0 --> 01:12:38,0
beholdest

291
01:12:38,0 --> 01:12:38,0
that it

292
01:12:38,0 --> 01:12:10,
hath brought forth much fruit.

293
01:12:10,0 --> 01:12:10,0
23 And it

294
01:12:10,0 --> 01:12:10,0
came to

295
01:12:10,0 --> 01:12:10,0
pass that

296
01:12:10,0 --> 01:12:10,0
the Lord

297
01:12:10,0 --> 01:12:10,0
of the

298
01:12:10,0 --> 01:12:10,0
vineyard

299
01:12:10,0 --> 01:12:10,0
said unto

300
01:12:10,0 --> 01:12:10,0
his

301
01:12:10,0 --> 01:12:10,0
servant: Look

302
01:12:10,0 --> 01:12:10,0
hither;

303
01:12:10,0 --> 01:12:10,0
behold I

304
01:12:10,0 --> 01:12:10,0
have

305
01:12:10,0 --> 01:12:10,0
planted

306
01:12:10,0 --> 01:12:10,0
another branch

307
01:12:10,0 --> 01:12:10,0
of the

308
01:12:10,0 --> 01:12:10,0
tree also;

309
01:12:10,0 --> 01:12:10,0
and thou

310
01:12:10,0 --> 01:12:10,0
knowest

311
01:12:10,0 --> 01:12:10,0
that this

312
01:12:10,0 --> 01:12:10,0
spot of

313
01:12:10,0 --> 01:12:10,0
ground was

314
01:12:10,0 --> 01:12:10,0
poorer

315
01:12:10,0 --> 01:12:10,0
than the

316
01:12:10,0 --> 01:12:10,0
first.

317
01:12:10,0 --> 01:12:10,0
But, behold

318
01:12:10,0 --> 01:12:10,0
the tree.

319
01:12:10,0 --> 01:12:10,0
I have

320
01:12:10,0 --> 01:12:10,0
nourished

321
01:12:10,0 --> 01:12:10,0
it this

322
01:12:10,0 --> 01:12:10,0
long time,

323
01:12:10,0 --> 01:12:10,0
and it

324
01:12:10,0 --> 01:12:10,0
hath

325
01:12:10,0 --> 01:12:10,0
brought forth

326
01:12:10,0 --> 01:12:10,0
much

327
01:12:10,0 --> 01:12:10,0
fruit;

328
01:12:10,0 --> 01:12:10,0
therefore,

329
01:12:10,0 --> 01:12:10,0
gather it,

330
01:12:10,0 --> 01:12:10,0
and lay it

331
01:12:10,0 --> 01:12:10,0
up

332
01:12:10,0 --> 01:12:10,0
against the

333
01:12:10,0 --> 01:26:48,
season, that I may preserve it unto mine own self.

334
01:26:48,0 --> 01:26:48,0
24 And

335
01:26:48,0 --> 01:26:48,0
it came

336
01:26:48,0 --> 01:26:48,0
to pass

337
01:26:48,0 --> 01:26:48,0

355
01:26:48,0 --> 01:26:48,0


356
01:26:48,0 --> 01:26:48,0
nourished it

357
01:26:48,0 --> 01:26:48,0
also, and

358
01:26:48,0 --> 01:29:58,
it hath brought forth fruit.

359
01:29:58,0 --> 01:29:58,0
25 And

360
01:29:58,0 --> 01:29:58,0
he said

361
01:29:58,0 --> 01:29:58,0
unto

362
01:29:58,0 --> 01:29:58,0
