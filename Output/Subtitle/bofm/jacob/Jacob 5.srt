00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,875
Chapter 5 Jacob quotes Zenos relative to the

2
00:00:00,875 --> 00:00:01,75
 allegory of the tame and wild olive trees—They are a

3
00:00:01,75 --> 00:00:02,625
 likeness of Israel and the Gentiles—The scattering

4
00:00:02,625 --> 00:00:03,5
 and gathering of Israel are prefigured—Allusions

5
00:00:03,5 --> 00:00:04,375
 are made to the Nephites and Lamanites and all the

6
00:00:04,375 --> 00:00:05,25
 house of Israel—The Gentiles will be grafted into

7
00:00:05,25 --> 00:00:06,125
 Israel—Eventually the vineyard will be burned.

00:00:06,125 --> 00:00:07,0
 About 544–421 B.C.

9
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:13,308
1 Behold, my brethren, do ye not remember to have

10
00:00:13,308 --> 00:00:18,641
 read the words of the prophet Zenos, which he

11
00:00:18,641 --> 00:00:23,974
 spake unto the house of Israel, saying

12
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:27,924
2 Hearken, O ye house of Israel, and hear the

13
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:31,924
 words of me, a prophet of the Lord

14
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:37,899
3 For behold, thus saith the Lord, I will liken

15
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:43,899
 thee, O house of Israel, like unto a tame olive

16
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:49,899
 tree, which a man took and nourished in his vineyard;

17
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:55,899
 and it grew, and waxed old, and began to decay

18
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,155
4 And it came to pass that the master of the

19
00:00:57,155 --> 00:00:58,488
 vineyard went forth, and he saw that his olive tree

20
00:00:58,488 --> 00:00:59,821
 began to decay; and he said: I will prune it, and dig

21
00:00:59,821 --> 00:01:01,154
 about it, and nourish it, that perhaps it may

22
00:01:01,154 --> 00:01:02,487
 shoot forth young and tender branches, and it perish

23
00:01:02,487 --> 00:01:03,82
 not

24
00:01:03,797 --> 00:02:47,464
5 And it came to pass that he pruned it, and

25
00:02:47,464 --> 00:04:31,131
 digged about it, and nourished it according to his

26
00:04:31,131 --> 00:06:14,798
 word

27
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:38,808
6 And it came to pass that after many days it

28
00:06:38,808 --> 00:07:02,808
 began to put forth somewhat a little, young and tender

29
00:07:02,808 --> 00:07:26,808
 branches; but behold, the main top thereof began

30
00:07:26,808 --> 00:07:50,808
 to perish

31
00:07:50,503 --> 00:08:00,503
7 And it came to pass that the master of the

32
00:08:00,503 --> 00:08:10,503
 vineyard saw it, and he said unto his servant: It

33
00:08:10,503 --> 00:08:20,503
 grieveth me that I should lose this tree; wherefore, go

34
00:08:20,503 --> 00:08:30,503
 and pluck the branches from a wild olive tree,

35
00:08:30,503 --> 00:08:40,503
 and bring them hither unto me; and we will pluck off

36
00:08:40,503 --> 00:08:50,503
 those main branches which are beginning to wither

37
00:08:50,503 --> 00:09:00,503
 away, and we will cast them into the fire that

38
00:09:00,503 --> 00:09:10,503
 they may be burned

39
00:09:10,25 --> 00:09:12,25
8 And behold, saith the Lord of the vineyard, I

40
00:09:12,25 --> 00:09:14,25
 take away many of these young and tender branches,

41
00:09:14,25 --> 00:09:16,25
 and I will graft them whithersoever I will; and it

42
00:09:16,25 --> 00:09:18,25
 mattereth not that if it so be that the root of

43
00:09:18,25 --> 00:09:20,25
 this tree will perish, I may preserve the fruit

44
00:09:20,25 --> 00:09:22,25
 thereof unto myself; wherefore, I will take these

45
00:09:22,25 --> 00:09:24,25
 young and tender branches, and I will graft them

46
00:09:24,25 --> 00:09:26,25
 whithersoever I will

47
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:37,399
9 Take thou the branches of the wild olive tree,

48
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:48,599
 and graft them in, in the stead thereof; and these

49
00:09:48,599 --> 00:09:59,799
 which I have plucked off I will cast into the fire

50
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:10,999
 and burn them, that they may not cumber the

51
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:22,199
 ground of my vineyard

52
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,771
10 And it came to pass that the servant of the

53
00:10:23,771 --> 00:10:25,521
 Lord of the vineyard did according to the word of the

54
00:10:25,521 --> 00:10:27,271
 Lord of the vineyard, and grafted in the branches

55
00:10:27,271 --> 00:10:29,021
 of the wild olive tree

56
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,139
11 And the Lord of the vineyard caused that it

57
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:32,282
 should be digged about, and pruned, and nourished,

58
00:10:32,282 --> 00:10:33,425
 saying unto his servant: It grieveth me that I

59
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:34,568
 should lose this tree; wherefore, that perhaps I might

60
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:35,711
 preserve the roots thereof that they perish not,

61
00:10:35,711 --> 00:10:36,854
 that I might preserve them unto myself, I have done

62
00:10:36,854 --> 00:10:37,997
 this thing

63
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:53,971
12 Wherefore, go thy way; watch the tree, and

64
00:10:53,971 --> 00:11:09,971
 nourish it, according to my words

65
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:14,44
13 And these will I place in the nethermost part

66
00:11:14,44 --> 00:11:19,011
 of my vineyard, whithersoever I will, it mattereth

67
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:23,582
 not unto thee; and I do it that I may preserve

68
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:28,153
 unto myself the natural branches of the tree; and

69
00:11:28,153 --> 00:11:32,724
 also, that I may lay up fruit thereof against the

70
00:11:32,724 --> 00:11:37,295
 season, unto myself; for it grieveth me that I should

71
00:11:37,295 --> 00:11:41,866
 lose this tree and the fruit thereof

72
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:46,568
14 And it came to pass that the Lord of the

73
00:11:46,568 --> 00:11:51,368
 vineyard went his way, and hid the natural branches of

74
00:11:51,368 --> 00:11:56,168
 the tame olive tree in the nethermost parts of the

75
00:11:56,168 --> 00:12:00,968
 vineyard, some in one and some in another,

76
00:12:00,968 --> 00:12:05,768
 according to his will and pleasure

77
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:13,692
15 And it came to pass that a long time passed

78
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:21,692
 away, and the Lord of the vineyard said unto his

79
00:12:21,692 --> 00:12:29,692
 servant: Come, let us go down into the vineyard, that

80
00:12:29,692 --> 00:12:37,692
 we may labor in the vineyard

81
00:12:37,59 --> 00:15:26,59
16 And it came to pass that the Lord of the

82
00:15:26,59 --> 00:18:15,59
 vineyard, and also the servant, went down into the

83
00:18:15,59 --> 00:21:04,59
 vineyard to labor. And it came to pass that the servant

84
00:21:04,59 --> 00:23:53,59
 said unto his master: Behold, look here; behold

85
00:23:53,59 --> 00:26:42,59
 the tree

86
00:26:42,901 --> 00:27:24,234
17 And it came to pass that the Lord of the

87
00:27:24,234 --> 00:28:05,567
 vineyard looked and beheld the tree in the which the

88
00:28:05,567 --> 00:28:46,9
 wild olive branches had been grafted; and it had

89
00:28:46,9 --> 00:29:28,233
 sprung forth and begun to bear fruit. And he beheld

90
00:29:28,233 --> 00:30:09,566
 that it was good; and the fruit thereof was like

91
00:30:09,566 --> 00:30:50,899
 unto the natural fruit

92
00:30:50,115 --> 00:32:19,206
18 And he said unto the servant: Behold, the

93
00:32:19,206 --> 00:33:48,297
 branches of the wild tree have taken hold of the

94
00:33:48,297 --> 00:35:17,388
 moisture of the root thereof, that the root thereof hath

95
00:35:17,388 --> 00:36:46,479
 brought forth much strength; and because of the

96
00:36:46,479 --> 00:38:15,57
 much strength of the root thereof the wild branches

97
00:38:15,57 --> 00:39:44,661
 have brought forth tame fruit. Now, if we had not

98
00:39:44,661 --> 00:41:13,752
 grafted in these branches, the tree thereof would

99
00:41:13,752 --> 00:42:42,843
 have perished. And now, behold, I shall lay up

100
00:42:42,843 --> 00:44:11,934
 much fruit, which the tree thereof hath brought

101
00:44:11,934 --> 00:45:41,025
 forth; and the fruit thereof I shall lay up against

102
00:45:41,025 --> 00:47:10,116
 the season, unto mine own self

103
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:16,328
19 And it came to pass that the Lord of the

104
00:47:16,328 --> 00:47:21,661
 vineyard said unto the servant: Come, let us go to the

105
00:47:21,661 --> 00:47:26,994
 nethermost part of the vineyard, and behold if the

106
00:47:26,994 --> 00:47:32,327
 natural branches of the tree have not brought

107
00:47:32,327 --> 00:47:37,66
 forth much fruit also, that I may lay up of the fruit

108
00:47:37,66 --> 00:47:42,993
 thereof against the season, unto mine own self

109
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:55,693
20 And it came to pass that they went forth

110
00:47:55,693 --> 00:48:08,493
 whither the master had hid the natural branches of the

111
00:48:08,493 --> 00:48:21,293
 tree, and he said unto the servant: Behold these;

112
00:48:21,293 --> 00:48:34,093
 and he beheld the first that it had brought forth

113
00:48:34,093 --> 00:48:46,893
 much fruit; and he beheld also that it was good.

114
00:48:46,893 --> 00:48:59,693
 And he said unto the servant: Take of the fruit

115
00:48:59,693 --> 00:49:12,493
 thereof, and lay it up against the season, that I may

116
00:49:12,493 --> 00:49:25,293
 preserve it unto mine own self; for behold, said

117
00:49:25,293 --> 00:49:38,093
 he, this long time have I nourished it, and it hath

118
00:49:38,093 --> 00:49:50,893
 brought forth much fruit

119
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:56,888
21 And it came to pass that the servant said unto

120
00:49:56,888 --> 00:50:03,288
 his master: How comest thou hither to plant this

121
00:50:03,288 --> 00:50:09,688
 tree, or this branch of the tree? For behold, it

122
00:50:09,688 --> 00:50:16,088
 was the poorest spot in all the land of thy

123
00:50:16,088 --> 00:50:22,488
 vineyard

124
00:50:22,386 --> 00:50:23,986
22 And the Lord of the vineyard said unto him:

125
00:50:23,986 --> 00:50:25,586
 Counsel me not; I knew that it was a poor spot of

126
00:50:25,586 --> 00:50:27,186
 ground; wherefore, I said unto thee, I have nourished

127
00:50:27,186 --> 00:50:28,786
 it this long time, and thou beholdest that it

128
00:50:28,786 --> 00:50:30,386
 hath brought forth much fruit

129
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:31,25
23 And it came to pass that the Lord of the

130
00:50:31,25 --> 00:50:32,139
 vineyard said unto his servant: Look hither; behold I

131
00:50:32,139 --> 00:50:33,028
 have planted another branch of the tree also; and

132
00:50:33,028 --> 00:50:33,917
 thou knowest that this spot of ground was poorer

133
00:50:33,917 --> 00:50:34,806
 than the first. But, behold the tree. I have

134
00:50:34,806 --> 00:50:35,695
 nourished it this long time, and it hath brought forth

135
00:50:35,695 --> 00:50:36,584
 much fruit; therefore, gather it, and lay it up

136
00:50:36,584 --> 00:50:37,473
 against the season, that I may preserve it unto mine

137
00:50:37,473 --> 00:50:38,362
 own self

138
00:50:38,335 --> 00:50:46,335
24 And it came to pass that the Lord of the

139
00:50:46,335 --> 00:50:54,335
 vineyard said again unto his servant: Look hither, and

140
00:50:54,335 --> 00:51:02,335
 behold another branch also, which I have planted;

141
00:51:02,335 --> 00:51:10,335
 behold that I have nourished it also, and it hath

142
00:51:10,335 --> 00:51:18,335
 brought forth fruit

143
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:20,494
25 And he said unto the servant: Look hither and

144
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:22,78
 behold the last. Behold, this have I planted in a

145
00:51:22,78 --> 00:51:25,066
 good spot of ground; and I have nourished it this

146
00:51:25,066 --> 00:51:27,352
 long time, and only a part of the tree hath brought

147
00:51:27,352 --> 00:51:29,638
 forth tame fruit, and the other part of the tree

148
00:51:29,638 --> 00:51:31,924
 hath brought forth wild fruit; behold, I have

149
00:51:31,924 --> 00:51:34,21
 nourished this tree like unto the others

150
00:51:34,158 --> 00:51:42,158
26 And it came to pass that the Lord of the

151
00:51:42,158 --> 00:51:50,158
 vineyard said unto the servant: Pluck off the branches

152
00:51:50,158 --> 00:51:58,158
 that have not brought forth good fruit, and cast

153
00:51:58,158 --> 00:52:06,158
 them into the fire

154
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:09,256
27 But behold, the servant said unto him: Let us

155
00:52:09,256 --> 00:52:12,456
 prune it, and dig about it, and nourish it a little

156
00:52:12,456 --> 00:52:15,656
 longer, that perhaps it may bring forth good

157
00:52:15,656 --> 00:52:18,856
 fruit unto thee, that thou canst lay it up against the

158
00:52:18,856 --> 00:52:22,056
 season

159
00:52:22,006 --> 00:52:24,339
28 And it came to pass that the Lord of the

160
00:52:24,339 --> 00:52:26,672
 vineyard and the servant of the Lord of the vineyard did

161
00:52:26,672 --> 00:52:29,005
 nourish all the fruit of the vineyard

162
00:52:29,98 --> 00:52:31,123
29 And it came to pass that a long time had passed

163
00:52:31,123 --> 00:52:32,266
 away, and the Lord of the vineyard said unto his

164
00:52:32,266 --> 00:52:33,409
 servant: Come, let us go down into the vineyard,

165
00:52:33,409 --> 00:52:34,552
 that we may labor again in the vineyard. For

166
00:52:34,552 --> 00:52:35,695
 behold, the time draweth near, and the end soon cometh;

167
00:52:35,695 --> 00:52:36,838
 wherefore, I must lay up fruit against the season,

168
00:52:36,838 --> 00:52:37,981
 unto mine own self

169
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:10,642
32 But behold, this time it hath brought forth

170
00:00:10,642 --> 00:00:13,309
 much fruit, and there is none of it which is good.

171
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:15,976
 And behold, there are all kinds of bad fruit; and it

172
00:00:15,976 --> 00:00:18,643
 profiteth me nothing, notwithstanding all our

173
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:21,31
 labor; and now it grieveth me that I should lose this

174
00:00:21,31 --> 00:00:23,977
 tree

175
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,924
33 And the Lord of the vineyard said unto the

176
00:00:25,924 --> 00:00:27,924
 servant: What shall we do unto the tree, that I may

177
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:29,924
 preserve again good fruit thereof unto mine own

178
00:00:29,924 --> 00:00:31,924
 self

179
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:36,699
34 And the servant said unto his master: Behold,

180
00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:41,499
 because thou didst graft in the branches of the

181
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:46,299
 wild olive tree they have nourished the roots, that

182
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:51,099
 they are alive and they have not perished;

183
00:00:51,099 --> 00:00:55,899
 wherefore thou beholdest that they are yet good

184
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,822
35 And it came to pass that the Lord of the

185
00:00:57,822 --> 00:00:59,822
 vineyard said unto his servant: The tree profiteth me

186
00:00:59,822 --> 00:01:01,822
 nothing, and the roots thereof profit me nothing so

187
00:01:01,822 --> 00:01:03,822
 long as it shall bring forth evil fruit

188
00:01:03,797 --> 00:02:05,997
36 Nevertheless, I know that the roots are good,

189
00:02:05,997 --> 00:03:08,197
 and for mine own purpose I have preserved them; and

190
00:03:08,197 --> 00:04:10,397
 because of their much strength they have hitherto

191
00:04:10,397 --> 00:05:12,597
 brought forth, from the wild branches, good

192
00:05:12,597 --> 00:06:14,797
 fruit

193
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:25,475
37 But behold, the wild branches have grown and

194
00:06:25,475 --> 00:06:36,142
 have overrun the roots thereof; and because that the

195
00:06:36,142 --> 00:06:46,809
 wild branches have overcome the roots thereof it

196
00:06:46,809 --> 00:06:57,476
 hath brought forth much evil fruit; and because

197
00:06:57,476 --> 00:07:08,143
 that it hath brought forth so much evil fruit thou

198
00:07:08,143 --> 00:07:18,81
 beholdest that it beginneth to perish; and it will

199
00:07:18,81 --> 00:07:29,477
 soon become ripened, that it may be cast into the

200
00:07:29,477 --> 00:07:40,144
 fire, except we should do something for it to

201
00:07:40,144 --> 00:07:50,811
 preserve it

202
00:07:50,503 --> 00:08:06,503
38 And it came to pass that the Lord of the

203
00:08:06,503 --> 00:08:22,503
 vineyard said unto his servant: Let us go down into the

204
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:38,503
 nethermost parts of the vineyard, and behold if

205
00:08:38,503 --> 00:08:54,503
 the natural branches have also brought forth evil

206
00:08:54,503 --> 00:09:10,503
 fruit

207
00:09:10,25 --> 00:09:12,917
39 And it came to pass that they went down into

208
00:09:12,917 --> 00:09:15,584
 the nethermost parts of the vineyard. And it came to

209
00:09:15,584 --> 00:09:18,251
 pass that they beheld that the fruit of the

210
00:09:18,251 --> 00:09:20,918
 natural branches had become corrupt also; yea, the

211
00:09:20,918 --> 00:09:23,585
 first and the second and also the last; and they had

212
00:09:23,585 --> 00:09:26,252
 all become corrupt

213
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:44,866
40 And the wild fruit of the last had overcome

214
00:09:44,866 --> 00:10:03,533
 that part of the tree which brought forth good fruit,

215
00:10:03,533 --> 00:10:22,2
 even that the branch had withered away and died

216
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:24,354
41 And it came to pass that the Lord of the

217
00:10:24,354 --> 00:10:26,687
 vineyard wept, and said unto the servant: What could I

218
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:29,02
 have done more for my vineyard

219
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,329
42 Behold, I knew that all the fruit of the

220
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:32,662
 vineyard, save it were these, had become corrupted. And

221
00:10:32,662 --> 00:10:33,995
 now these which have once brought forth good fruit

222
00:10:33,995 --> 00:10:35,328
 have also become corrupted; and now all the trees

223
00:10:35,328 --> 00:10:36,661
 of my vineyard are good for nothing save it be to

224
00:10:36,661 --> 00:10:37,994
 be hewn down and cast into the fire

225
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:45,971
43 And behold this last, whose branch hath

226
00:10:45,971 --> 00:10:53,971
 withered away, I did plant in a good spot of ground; yea,

227
00:10:53,971 --> 00:11:01,971
 even that which was choice unto me above all

228
00:11:01,971 --> 00:11:09,971
 other parts of the land of my vineyard

229
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:20,536
44 And thou beheldest that I also cut down that

230
00:11:20,536 --> 00:11:31,203
 which cumbered this spot of ground, that I might

231
00:11:31,203 --> 00:11:41,87
 plant this tree in the stead thereof

232
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:45,768
45 And thou beheldest that a part thereof brought

233
00:11:45,768 --> 00:11:49,768
 forth good fruit, and a part thereof brought forth

234
00:11:49,768 --> 00:11:53,768
 wild fruit; and because I plucked not the

235
00:11:53,768 --> 00:11:57,768
 branches thereof and cast them into the fire, behold,

236
00:11:57,768 --> 00:12:01,768
 they have overcome the good branch that it hath

237
00:12:01,768 --> 00:12:05,768
 withered away

238
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:09,248
46 And now, behold, notwithstanding all the care

239
00:12:09,248 --> 00:12:12,804
 which we have taken of my vineyard, the trees

240
00:12:12,804 --> 00:12:16,36
 thereof have become corrupted, that they bring forth no

241
00:12:16,36 --> 00:12:19,916
 good fruit; and these I had hoped to preserve, to

242
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:23,472
 have laid up fruit thereof against the season,

243
00:12:23,472 --> 00:12:27,028
 unto mine own self. But, behold, they have become

244
00:12:27,028 --> 00:12:30,584
 like unto the wild olive tree, and they are of no

245
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:34,14
 worth but to be hewn down and cast into the fire;

246
00:12:34,14 --> 00:12:37,696
 and it grieveth me that I should lose them

247
00:12:37,59 --> 00:14:02,09
47 But what could I have done more in my vineyard?

248
00:14:02,09 --> 00:15:26,59
 Have I slackened mine hand, that I have not

249
00:15:26,59 --> 00:16:51,09
 nourished it? Nay, I have nourished it, and I have

250
00:16:51,09 --> 00:18:15,59
 digged about it, and I have pruned it, and I have

251
00:18:15,59 --> 00:19:40,09
 dunged it; and I have stretched forth mine hand almost

252
00:19:40,09 --> 00:21:04,59
 all the day long, and the end draweth nigh. And

253
00:21:04,59 --> 00:22:29,09
 it grieveth me that I should hew down all the trees

254
00:22:29,09 --> 00:23:53,59
 of my vineyard, and cast them into the fire that

255
00:23:53,59 --> 00:25:18,09
 they should be burned. Who is it that has

256
00:25:18,09 --> 00:26:42,59
 corrupted my vineyard

257
00:26:42,901 --> 00:27:10,457
48 And it came to pass that the servant said unto

258
00:27:10,457 --> 00:27:38,013
 his master: Is it not the loftiness of thy

259
00:27:38,013 --> 00:28:05,569
 vineyard—have not the branches thereof overcome the roots

260
00:28:05,569 --> 00:28:33,125
 which are good? And because the branches have

261
00:28:33,125 --> 00:29:00,681
 overcome the roots thereof, behold they grew faster

262
00:29:00,681 --> 00:29:28,237
 than the strength of the roots, taking strength

263
00:29:28,237 --> 00:29:55,793
 unto themselves. Behold, I say, is not this the cause

264
00:29:55,793 --> 00:30:23,349
 that the trees of thy vineyard have become

265
00:30:23,349 --> 00:30:50,905
 corrupted

266
00:30:50,115 --> 00:33:33,448
49 And it came to pass that the Lord of the

267
00:33:33,448 --> 00:36:16,781
 vineyard said unto the servant: Let us go to and hew

268
00:36:16,781 --> 00:39:00,114
 down the trees of the vineyard and cast them into the

269
00:39:00,114 --> 00:41:43,447
 fire, that they shall not cumber the ground of my

270
00:41:43,447 --> 00:44:26,78
 vineyard, for I have done all. What could I have

271
00:44:26,78 --> 00:47:10,113
 done more for my vineyard

272
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:26,995
50 But, behold, the servant said unto the Lord of

273
00:47:26,995 --> 00:47:42,995
 the vineyard: Spare it a little longer

274
00:47:42,893 --> 00:48:25,56
51 And the Lord said: Yea, I will spare it a

275
00:48:25,56 --> 00:49:08,227
 little longer, for it grieveth me that I should lose

276
00:49:08,227 --> 00:49:50,894
 the trees of my vineyard

277
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:55,059
52 Wherefore, let us take of the branches of these

278
00:49:55,059 --> 00:49:59,63
 which I have planted in the nethermost parts of

279
00:49:59,63 --> 00:50:04,201
 my vineyard, and let us graft them into the tree

280
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:08,772
 from whence they came; and let us pluck from the

281
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:13,343
 tree those branches whose fruit is most bitter, and

282
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:17,914
 graft in the natural branches of the tree in the

283
00:50:17,914 --> 00:50:22,485
 stead thereof

284
00:50:22,386 --> 00:50:25,053
53 And this will I do that the tree may not

285
00:50:25,053 --> 00:50:27,72
 perish, that, perhaps, I may preserve unto myself the

286
00:50:27,72 --> 00:50:30,387
 roots thereof for mine own purpose

287
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:31,088
54 And, behold, the roots of the natural branches

288
00:50:31,088 --> 00:50:31,815
 of the tree which I planted whithersoever I would

289
00:50:31,815 --> 00:50:32,542
 are yet alive; wherefore, that I may preserve them

290
00:50:32,542 --> 00:50:33,269
 also for mine own purpose, I will take of the

291
00:50:33,269 --> 00:50:33,996
 branches of this tree, and I will graft them in unto

292
00:50:33,996 --> 00:50:34,723
 them. Yea, I will graft in unto them the branches

293
00:50:34,723 --> 00:50:35,45
 of their mother tree, that I may preserve the

294
00:50:35,45 --> 00:50:36,177
 roots also unto mine own self, that when they shall be

295
00:50:36,177 --> 00:50:36,904
 sufficiently strong perhaps they may bring forth

296
00:50:36,904 --> 00:50:37,631
 good fruit unto me, and I may yet have glory in

297
00:50:37,631 --> 00:50:38,358
 the fruit of my vineyard

298
00:50:38,335 --> 00:50:51,668
55 And it came to pass that they took from the

299
00:50:51,668 --> 00:51:05,001
 natural tree which had become wild, and grafted in

300
00:51:05,001 --> 00:51:18,334
 unto the natural trees, which also had become wild

301
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:23,541
56 And they also took of the natural trees which

302
00:51:23,541 --> 00:51:28,874
 had become wild, and grafted into their mother

303
00:51:28,874 --> 00:51:34,207
 tree

304
00:51:34,158 --> 00:51:40,558
57 And the Lord of the vineyard said unto the

305
00:51:40,558 --> 00:51:46,958
 servant: Pluck not the wild branches from the trees,

306
00:51:46,958 --> 00:51:53,358
 save it be those which are most bitter; and in them

307
00:51:53,358 --> 00:51:59,758
 ye shall graft according to that which I have

308
00:51:59,758 --> 00:52:06,158
 said

309
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:09,256
58 And we will nourish again the trees of the

310
00:52:09,256 --> 00:52:12,456
 vineyard, and we will trim up the branches thereof;

311
00:52:12,456 --> 00:52:15,656
 and we will pluck from the trees those branches

312
00:52:15,656 --> 00:52:18,856
 which are ripened, that must perish, and cast them

313
00:52:18,856 --> 00:52:22,056
 into the fire

314
00:52:22,006 --> 00:52:23,756
59 And this I do that, perhaps, the roots thereof

315
00:52:23,756 --> 00:52:25,506
 may take strength because of their goodness; and

316
00:52:25,506 --> 00:52:27,256
 because of the change of the branches, that the

317
00:52:27,256 --> 00:52:29,006
 good may overcome the evil

318
00:52:29,98 --> 00:52:30,78
60 And because that I have preserved the natural

319
00:52:30,78 --> 00:52:31,58
 branches and the roots thereof, and that I have

320
00:52:31,58 --> 00:52:32,38
 grafted in the natural branches again into their

321
00:52:32,38 --> 00:52:33,18
 mother tree, and have preserved the roots of their

322
00:52:33,18 --> 00:52:33,98
 mother tree, that, perhaps, the trees of my vineyard

323
00:52:33,98 --> 00:52:34,78
 may bring forth again good fruit; and that I may

324
00:52:34,78 --> 00:52:35,58
 have joy again in the fruit of my vineyard, and,

325
00:52:35,58 --> 00:52:36,38
 perhaps, that I may rejoice exceedingly that I have

326
00:52:36,38 --> 00:52:37,18
 preserved the roots and the branches of the first

327
00:52:37,18 --> 00:52:37,98
 fruit

328
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:10,642
63 Graft in the branches; begin at the last that

329
00:00:10,642 --> 00:00:13,309
 they may be first, and that the first may be last,

330
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:15,976
 and dig about the trees, both old and young, the

331
00:00:15,976 --> 00:00:18,643
 first and the last; and the last and the first,

332
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:21,31
 that all may be nourished once again for the last

333
00:00:21,31 --> 00:00:23,977
 time

334
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,257
64 Wherefore, dig about them, and prune them, and

335
00:00:25,257 --> 00:00:26,59
 dung them once more, for the last time, for the

336
00:00:26,59 --> 00:00:27,923
 end draweth nigh. And if it be so that these last

337
00:00:27,923 --> 00:00:29,256
 grafts shall grow, and bring forth the natural

338
00:00:29,256 --> 00:00:30,589
 fruit, then shall ye prepare the way for them, that

339
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:31,922
 they may grow

340
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:35,328
65 And as they begin to grow ye shall clear away

341
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:38,757
 the branches which bring forth bitter fruit,

342
00:00:38,757 --> 00:00:42,186
 according to the strength of the good and the size

343
00:00:42,186 --> 00:00:45,615
 thereof; and ye shall not clear away the bad thereof

344
00:00:45,615 --> 00:00:49,044
 all at once, lest the roots thereof should be too

345
00:00:49,044 --> 00:00:52,473
 strong for the graft, and the graft thereof shall

346
00:00:52,473 --> 00:00:55,902
 perish, and I lose the trees of my vineyard

347
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:56,822
66 For it grieveth me that I should lose the trees

348
00:00:56,822 --> 00:00:57,822
 of my vineyard; wherefore ye shall clear away the

349
00:00:57,822 --> 00:00:58,822
 bad according as the good shall grow, that the

350
00:00:58,822 --> 00:00:59,822
 root and the top may be equal in strength, until the

351
00:00:59,822 --> 00:01:00,822
 good shall overcome the bad, and the bad be hewn

352
00:01:00,822 --> 00:01:01,822
 down and cast into the fire, that they cumber not

353
00:01:01,822 --> 00:01:02,822
 the ground of my vineyard; and thus will I sweep

354
00:01:02,822 --> 00:01:03,822
 away the bad out of my vineyard

355
00:01:03,797 --> 00:03:39,297
67 And the branches of the natural tree will I

356
00:03:39,297 --> 00:06:14,797
 graft in again into the natural tree

357
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:34,008
68 And the branches of the natural tree will I

358
00:06:34,008 --> 00:06:53,208
 graft into the natural branches of the tree; and thus

359
00:06:53,208 --> 00:07:12,408
 will I bring them together again, that they shall

360
00:07:12,408 --> 00:07:31,608
 bring forth the natural fruit, and they shall be

361
00:07:31,608 --> 00:07:50,808
 one

362
00:07:50,503 --> 00:08:17,17
69 And the bad shall be cast away, yea, even out

363
00:08:17,17 --> 00:08:43,837
 of all the land of my vineyard; for behold, only

364
00:08:43,837 --> 00:09:10,504
 this once will I prune my vineyard

365
00:09:10,25 --> 00:09:14,25
70 And it came to pass that the Lord of the

366
00:09:14,25 --> 00:09:18,25
 vineyard sent his servant; and the servant went and did

367
00:09:18,25 --> 00:09:22,25
 as the Lord had commanded him, and brought other

368
00:09:22,25 --> 00:09:26,25
 servants; and they were few

369
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:33,199
71 And the Lord of the vineyard said unto them: Go

370
00:09:33,199 --> 00:09:40,199
 to, and labor in the vineyard, with your might.

371
00:09:40,199 --> 00:09:47,199
 For behold, this is the last time that I shall

372
00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:54,199
 nourish my vineyard; for the end is nigh at hand, and

373
00:09:54,199 --> 00:10:01,199
 the season speedily cometh; and if ye labor with

374
00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:08,199
 your might with me ye shall have joy in the fruit

375
00:10:08,199 --> 00:10:15,199
 which I shall lay up unto myself against the time

376
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:22,199
 which will soon come

377
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,421
72 And it came to pass that the servants did go

378
00:10:23,421 --> 00:10:24,821
 and labor with their mights; and the Lord of the

379
00:10:24,821 --> 00:10:26,221
 vineyard labored also with them; and they did obey

380
00:10:26,221 --> 00:10:27,621
 the commandments of the Lord of the vineyard in all

381
00:10:27,621 --> 00:10:29,021
 things

382
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,329
73 And there began to be the natural fruit again

383
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:32,662
 in the vineyard; and the natural branches began to

384
00:10:32,662 --> 00:10:33,995
 grow and thrive exceedingly; and the wild branches

385
00:10:33,995 --> 00:10:35,328
 began to be plucked off and to be cast away; and

386
00:10:35,328 --> 00:10:36,661
 they did keep the root and the top thereof equal,

387
00:10:36,661 --> 00:10:37,994
 according to the strength thereof

388
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:41,527
74 And thus they labored, with all diligence,

389
00:10:41,527 --> 00:10:45,083
 according to the commandments of the Lord of the

390
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:48,639
 vineyard, even until the bad had been cast away out of

391
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:52,195
 the vineyard, and the Lord had preserved unto

392
00:10:52,195 --> 00:10:55,751
 himself that the trees had become again the natural

393
00:10:55,751 --> 00:10:59,307
 fruit; and they became like unto one body; and the

394
00:10:59,307 --> 00:11:02,863
 fruits were equal; and the Lord of the vineyard had

395
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:06,419
 preserved unto himself the natural fruit, which

396
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:09,975
 was most precious unto him from the beginning

397
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:12,155
75 And it came to pass that when the Lord of the

398
00:11:12,155 --> 00:11:14,441
 vineyard saw that his fruit was good, and that his

399
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:16,727
 vineyard was no more corrupt, he called up his

400
00:11:16,727 --> 00:11:19,013
 servants, and said unto them: Behold, for this last

401
00:11:19,013 --> 00:11:21,299
 time have we nourished my vineyard; and thou

402
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:23,585
 beholdest that I have done according to my will; and I

403
00:11:23,585 --> 00:11:25,871
 have preserved the natural fruit, that it is good,

404
00:11:25,871 --> 00:11:28,157
 even like as it was in the beginning. And blessed

405
00:11:28,157 --> 00:11:30,443
 art thou; for because ye have been diligent in

406
00:11:30,443 --> 00:11:32,729
 laboring with me in my vineyard, and have kept my

407
00:11:32,729 --> 00:11:35,015
 commandments, and have brought unto me again the

408
00:11:35,015 --> 00:11:37,301
 natural fruit, that my vineyard is no more corrupted,

409
00:11:37,301 --> 00:11:39,587
 and the bad is cast away, behold ye shall have joy

410
00:11:39,587 --> 00:11:41,873
 with me because of the fruit of my vineyard

411
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:45,197
76 For behold, for a long time will I lay up of

412
00:11:45,197 --> 00:11:48,626
 the fruit of my vineyard unto mine own self against

413
00:11:48,626 --> 00:11:52,055
 the season, which speedily cometh; and for the

414
00:11:52,055 --> 00:11:55,484
 last time have I nourished my vineyard, and pruned

415
00:11:55,484 --> 00:11:58,913
 it, and dug about it, and dunged it; wherefore I

416
00:11:58,913 --> 00:12:02,342
 will lay up unto mine own self of the fruit, for a

417
00:12:02,342 --> 00:12:05,771
 long time, according to that which I have spoken

418
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:05,835
77 And when the time cometh that evil fruit shall

419
00:12:05,835 --> 00:12:05,978
 again come into my vineyard, then will I cause the

420
00:12:05,978 --> 00:12:06,121
 good and the bad to be gathered; and the good

421
00:12:06,121 --> 00:12:06,264
 will I preserve unto myself, and the bad will I cast

422
00:12:06,264 --> 00:12:06,407
 away into its own place. And then cometh the

423
00:12:06,407 --> 00:12:06,55
 season and the end; and my vineyard will I cause to be

424
00:12:06,55 --> 00:12:06,693
 burned with fire.
