00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,75
Chapter 6 The Lord will recover Israel in the last

2
00:00:01,75 --> 00:00:03,5
 days—The world will be burned with fire—Men must

3
00:00:03,5 --> 00:00:05,25
 follow Christ to avoid the lake of fire and

4
00:00:05,25 --> 00:00:07,0
 brimstone. About 544–421 B.C.

5
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,308
1 And now, behold, my brethren, as I said unto you

6
00:00:09,308 --> 00:00:10,641
 that I would prophesy, behold, this is my

7
00:00:10,641 --> 00:00:11,974
 prophecy—that the things which this prophet Zenos spake,

8
00:00:11,974 --> 00:00:13,307
 concerning the house of Israel, in the which he

9
00:00:13,307 --> 00:00:14,64
 likened them unto a tame olive tree, must surely

10
00:00:14,64 --> 00:00:15,973
 come to pass

11
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,282
2 And the day that he shall set his hand again the

12
00:00:17,282 --> 00:00:18,615
 second time to recover his people, is the day,

13
00:00:18,615 --> 00:00:19,948
 yea, even the last time, that the servants of the

14
00:00:19,948 --> 00:00:21,281
 Lord shall go forth in his power, to nourish and

15
00:00:21,281 --> 00:00:22,614
 prune his vineyard; and after that the end soon

16
00:00:22,614 --> 00:00:23,947
 cometh

17
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,924
3 And how blessed are they who have labored

18
00:00:25,924 --> 00:00:27,924
 diligently in his vineyard; and how cursed are they who

19
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:29,924
 shall be cast out into their own place! And the

20
00:00:29,924 --> 00:00:31,924
 world shall be burned with fire

21
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,232
4 And how merciful is our God unto us, for he

22
00:00:33,232 --> 00:00:34,565
 remembereth the house of Israel, both roots and

23
00:00:34,565 --> 00:00:35,898
 branches; and he stretches forth his hands unto them all

24
00:00:35,898 --> 00:00:37,231
 the day long; and they are a stiffnecked and a

25
00:00:37,231 --> 00:00:38,564
 gainsaying people; but as many as will not harden

26
00:00:38,564 --> 00:00:39,897
 their hearts shall be saved in the kingdom of God

27
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:57,206
5 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, I beseech of you

28
00:00:57,206 --> 00:01:14,539
 in words of soberness that ye would repent, and

29
00:01:14,539 --> 00:01:31,872
 come with full purpose of heart, and cleave unto

30
00:01:31,872 --> 00:01:49,205
 God as he cleaveth unto you. And while his arm of

31
00:01:49,205 --> 00:02:06,538
 mercy is extended towards you in the light of the

32
00:02:06,538 --> 00:02:23,871
 day, harden not your hearts

33
00:02:23,543 --> 00:04:39,043
6 Yea, today, if ye will hear his voice, harden

34
00:04:39,043 --> 00:06:54,543
 not your hearts; for why will ye die

35
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:58,681
7 For behold, after ye have been nourished by the

36
00:06:58,681 --> 00:07:02,681
 good word of God all the day long, will ye bring

37
00:07:02,681 --> 00:07:06,681
 forth evil fruit, that ye must be hewn down and

38
00:07:06,681 --> 00:07:10,681
 cast into the fire

39
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,308
10 And according to the power of justice, for

40
00:00:09,308 --> 00:00:10,641
 justice cannot be denied, ye must go away into that

41
00:00:10,641 --> 00:00:11,974
 lake of fire and brimstone, whose flames are

42
00:00:11,974 --> 00:00:13,307
 unquenchable, and whose smoke ascendeth up forever and

43
00:00:13,307 --> 00:00:14,64
 ever, which lake of fire and brimstone is endless

44
00:00:14,64 --> 00:00:15,973
 torment

45
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,949
11 O then, my beloved brethren, repent ye, and

46
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:19,949
 enter in at the strait gate, and continue in the way

47
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:21,949
 which is narrow, until ye shall obtain eternal

48
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:23,949
 life

49
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:31,924
12 O be wise; what can I say more

50
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:32,149
13 Finally, I bid you farewell, until I shall meet

51
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:32,399
 you before the pleasing bar of God, which bar

52
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:32,649
 striketh the wicked with awful dread and fear. Amen.

53
00:00:32,649 --> 00:00:32,899
