00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:04,0
Chapter 6 The Lord will recover Israel in

2
00:00:04,0 --> 00:00:08,0
the last days—The world will be burned with

3
00:00:08,0 --> 00:00:12,0
fire—Men must follow Christ to avoid the

4
00:00:12,0 --> 00:00:16,95
lake of fire and brimstone. About 544–421 B.C. 

5
00:00:16,95 --> 00:00:18,95
1 And now, behold, my brethren, as I

6
00:00:18,95 --> 00:00:20,95
said unto you that I would prophesy,

7
00:00:20,95 --> 00:00:22,95
behold, this is my prophecy—that the

8
00:00:22,95 --> 00:00:24,95
things which this prophet Zenos

9
00:00:24,95 --> 00:00:26,95
spake, concerning the house of Israel, in

10
00:00:26,95 --> 00:00:28,95
the which he likened them unto a tame

11
00:00:28,95 --> 00:00:30,33
olive tree, must surely come to pass.

12
00:00:30,33 --> 00:00:31,616
2 And the day that he shall set his

13
00:00:31,616 --> 00:00:32,902
hand again the second time to

14
00:00:32,902 --> 00:00:34,188
recover his people, is the day, yea, even

15
00:00:34,188 --> 00:00:35,474
the last time, that the servants of

16
00:00:35,474 --> 00:00:36,76
the Lord shall go forth in his

17
00:00:36,76 --> 00:00:38,046
power, to nourish and prune his vineyard;

18
00:00:38,046 --> 00:00:39,306
and after that the end soon cometh.

19
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:42,906
3 And how blessed are they who have

20
00:00:42,906 --> 00:00:46,506
labored diligently in his vineyard;

21
00:00:46,506 --> 00:00:50,106
and how cursed are they who shall be

22
00:00:50,106 --> 00:00:53,706
cast out into their own place! And

23
00:00:53,706 --> 00:00:57,157
the world shall be burned with fire.

24
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
4 And how merciful is our God

25
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
unto us, for he remembereth the

26
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
house of Israel, both roots and

27
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
branches; and he stretches forth his

28
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
hands unto them all the day long;

29
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
and they are a stiffnecked and a

30
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
gainsaying people; but as many as

31
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
will not harden their hearts

32
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
shall be saved in the kingdom of God.

33
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
5 Wherefore, my beloved

34
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
brethren, I beseech of you in words

35
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
of soberness that ye would

36
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
repent, and come with full

37
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
purpose of heart, and cleave unto

38
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
God as he cleaveth unto you. And

39
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
while his arm of mercy is

40
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
extended towards you in the light

41
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
of the day, harden not your hearts.

42
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
6 Yea, today, if ye will

43
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
hear his voice, harden not your

44
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
hearts; for why will ye die?

45
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
7 For behold, after ye have

46
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
been nourished by the good

47
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
word of God all the day

48
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
long, will ye bring forth

49
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
evil fruit, that ye must be

50
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
hewn down and cast into the fire?

51
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
8 Behold, will ye reject

52
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
these words? Will ye reject

53
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
the words of the

54
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
prophets; and will ye reject all

55
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
the words which have been

56
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
spoken concerning Christ,

57
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
after so many have spoken

58
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
concerning him; and deny

59
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
the good word of Christ, and

60
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
the power of God, and the

61
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
gift of the Holy Ghost,

62
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
and quench the Holy Spirit,

63
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
and make a mock of the

64
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
great plan of redemption,

65
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
which hath been laid for you?

66
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
9 Know ye not that if ye

67
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
will do these things,

68
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
that the power of the

69
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
redemption and the

70
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
resurrection, which is in

71
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
Christ, will bring you to

72
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
stand with shame and awful

73
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
guilt before the bar of God?

74
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
10 And according to the

75
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
power of justice, for

76
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
justice cannot be

77
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
denied, ye must go away into

78
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
that lake of fire and

79
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
brimstone, whose flames

80
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
are unquenchable, and

81
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
whose smoke ascendeth

82
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
up forever and ever,

83
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
which lake of fire and

84
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
brimstone is endless torment.

85
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
11 O then, my beloved

86
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
brethren, repent ye,

87
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
and enter in at the

88
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
strait gate, and

89
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
continue in the way which

90
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
is narrow, until ye

91
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
shall obtain eternal life.

92
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
12 O be wise;

93
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
what can I say more?

94
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
13 Finally, I

95
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
bid you farewell,

96
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
until I shall

97
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
meet you before

98
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
the pleasing bar

99
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
of God, which bar

100
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
striketh the

101
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
wicked with awful

102
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:57,157
dread and fear. Amen.
