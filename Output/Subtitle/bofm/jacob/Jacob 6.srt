00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 6 The Lord will recover Israel in

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the last days—The world will be burned with

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
fire—Men must follow Christ to avoid the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:04:29,
lake of fire and brimstone. About 544–421 B.C. 

5
00:04:29,0 --> 00:04:29,0
1 And now, behold, my brethren, as I

6
00:04:29,0 --> 00:04:29,0
said unto you that I would prophesy,

7
00:04:29,0 --> 00:04:29,0
behold, this is my prophecy—that the

8
00:04:29,0 --> 00:04:29,0
things which this prophet Zenos

9
00:04:29,0 --> 00:04:29,0
spake, concerning the house of Israel, in

10
00:04:29,0 --> 00:04:29,0
the which he likened them unto a tame

11
00:04:29,0 --> 00:09:57,
olive tree, must surely come to pass.

12
00:09:57,0 --> 00:09:57,0
2 And the day that he shall set his

13
00:09:57,0 --> 00:09:57,0
hand again the second time to

14
00:09:57,0 --> 00:09:57,0
recover his people, is the day, yea, even

15
00:09:57,0 --> 00:09:57,0
the last time, that the servants of

16
00:09:57,0 --> 00:09:57,0
the Lord shall go forth in his

17
00:09:57,0 --> 00:09:57,0
power, to nourish and prune his vineyard;

18
00:09:57,0 --> 00:18:08,
and after that the end soon cometh.

19
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
3 And how blessed are they who have

20
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
labored diligently in his vineyard;

21
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
and how cursed are they who shall be

22
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
cast out into their own place! And

23
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,
the world shall be burned with fire.

24
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
4 And how merciful is our God

25
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
unto us, for he remembereth the

26
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
house of Israel, both roots and

27
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
branches; and he stretches forth his

28
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
hands unto them all the day long;

29
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
and they are a stiffnecked and a

30
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
gainsaying people; but as many as

31
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
will not harden their hearts

32
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,
shall be saved in the kingdom of God.

33
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
5 Wherefore, my beloved

34
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
brethren, I beseech of you in words

35
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
of soberness that ye would

36
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
repent, and come with full

37
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
purpose of heart, and cleave unto

38
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
God as he cleaveth unto you. And

39
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
while his arm of mercy is

40
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
extended towards you in the light

41
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,
of the day, harden not your hearts.

42
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
6 Yea, today, if ye will

43
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
hear his voice, harden not your

44
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,
hearts; for why will ye die?

45
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
7 For behold, after ye have

46
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
been nourished by the good

47
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
word of God all the day

48
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
long, will ye bring forth

49
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
evil fruit, that ye must be

50
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,
hewn down and cast into the fire?

51
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
8 Behold, will ye reject

52
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
these words? Will ye reject

53
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
the words of the

54
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
prophets; and will ye reject all

55
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
the words which have been

56
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
spoken concerning Christ,

57
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
after so many have spoken

58
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
concerning him; and deny

59
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
the good word of Christ, and

60
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
the power of God, and the

61
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
gift of the Holy Ghost,

62
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
and quench the Holy Spirit,

63
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
and make a mock of the

64
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
great plan of redemption,

65
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,
which hath been laid for you?

66
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
9 Know ye not that if ye

67
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
will do these things,

68
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
that the power of the

69
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
redemption and the

70
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
resurrection, which is in

71
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
Christ, will bring you to

72
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
stand with shame and awful

73
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,
guilt before the bar of God?

74
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
10 And according to the

75
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
power of justice, for

76
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
justice cannot be

77
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
denied, ye must go away into

78
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
that lake of fire and

79
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
brimstone, whose flames

80
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
are unquenchable, and

81
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
whose smoke ascendeth

82
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
up forever and ever,

83
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
which lake of fire and

84
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,
brimstone is endless torment.

85
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
11 O then, my beloved

86
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
brethren, repent ye,

87
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
and enter in at the

88
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
strait gate, and

89
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
continue in the way which

90
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
is narrow, until ye

91
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,
shall obtain eternal life.

92
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
12 O be wise;

93
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,
what can I say more?

94
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
13 Finally, I

95
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
bid you farewell,

96
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
until I shall

97
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
meet you before

98
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
the pleasing bar

99
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
of God, which bar

100
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
striketh the

101
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,0
wicked with awful

102
00:18:08,0 --> 00:18:08,
dread and fear. Amen.
