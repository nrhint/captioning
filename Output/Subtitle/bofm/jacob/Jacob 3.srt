00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,75
Chapter 3 The pure in heart receive the pleasing

2
00:00:01,75 --> 00:00:03,5
 word of God—Lamanite righteousness exceeds that of

3
00:00:03,5 --> 00:00:05,25
 the Nephites—Jacob warns against fornication,

4
00:00:05,25 --> 00:00:07,0
 lasciviousness, and every sin. About 544–421 B.C.

5
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,308
1 But behold, I, Jacob, would speak unto you that

6
00:00:09,308 --> 00:00:10,641
 are pure in heart. Look unto God with firmness of

7
00:00:10,641 --> 00:00:11,974
 mind, and pray unto him with exceeding faith, and

8
00:00:11,974 --> 00:00:13,307
 he will console you in your afflictions, and he

9
00:00:13,307 --> 00:00:14,64
 will plead your cause, and send down justice upon

10
00:00:14,64 --> 00:00:15,973
 those who seek your destruction

11
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,949
2 O all ye that are pure in heart, lift up your

12
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:19,949
 heads and receive the pleasing word of God, and

13
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:21,949
 feast upon his love; for ye may, if your minds are

14
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:23,949
 firm, forever

15
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:25,257
3 But, wo, wo, unto you that are not pure in

16
00:00:25,257 --> 00:00:26,59
 heart, that are filthy this day before God; for except

17
00:00:26,59 --> 00:00:27,923
 ye repent the land is cursed for your sakes; and

18
00:00:27,923 --> 00:00:29,256
 the Lamanites, which are not filthy like unto you,

19
00:00:29,256 --> 00:00:30,589
 nevertheless they are cursed with a sore cursing,

20
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:31,922
 shall scourge you even unto destruction

21
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,899
4 And the time speedily cometh, that except ye

22
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,899
 repent they shall possess the land of your

23
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:37,899
 inheritance, and the Lord God will lead away the righteous

24
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:39,899
 out from among you

25
00:00:39,873 --> 00:01:31,748
5 Behold, the Lamanites your brethren, whom ye

26
00:01:31,748 --> 00:02:23,623
 hate because of their filthiness and the cursing

27
00:02:23,623 --> 00:03:15,498
 which hath come upon their skins, are more righteous

28
00:03:15,498 --> 00:04:07,373
 than you; for they have not forgotten the

29
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:59,248
 commandment of the Lord, which was given unto our

30
00:04:59,248 --> 00:05:51,123
 father—that they should have save it were one wife, and

31
00:05:51,123 --> 00:06:42,998
 concubines they should have none, and there should

32
00:06:42,998 --> 00:07:34,873
 not be whoredoms committed among them

33
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:36,154
6 And now, this commandment they observe to keep;

34
00:07:36,154 --> 00:07:37,754
 wherefore, because of this observance, in keeping

35
00:07:37,754 --> 00:07:39,354
 this commandment, the Lord God will not destroy

36
00:07:39,354 --> 00:07:40,954
 them, but will be merciful unto them; and one day

37
00:07:40,954 --> 00:07:42,554
 they shall become a blessed people

38
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:44,815
7 Behold, their husbands love their wives, and

39
00:07:44,815 --> 00:07:47,101
 their wives love their husbands; and their husbands

40
00:07:47,101 --> 00:07:49,387
 and their wives love their children; and their

41
00:07:49,387 --> 00:07:51,673
 unbelief and their hatred towards you is because of

42
00:07:51,673 --> 00:07:53,959
 the iniquity of their fathers; wherefore, how much

43
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:56,245
 better are you than they, in the sight of your

44
00:07:56,245 --> 00:07:58,531
 great Creator

45
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,478
8 O my brethren, I fear that unless ye shall

46
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:06,478
 repent of your sins that their skins will be whiter

47
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:10,478
 than yours, when ye shall be brought with them before

48
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:14,478
 the throne of God

49
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:18,998
9 Wherefore, a commandment I give unto you, which

50
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:23,569
 is the word of God, that ye revile no more against

51
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:28,14
 them because of the darkness of their skins;

52
00:08:28,14 --> 00:08:32,711
 neither shall ye revile against them because of their

53
00:08:32,711 --> 00:08:37,282
 filthiness; but ye shall remember your own

54
00:08:37,282 --> 00:08:41,853
 filthiness, and remember that their filthiness came

55
00:08:41,853 --> 00:08:46,424
 because of their fathers

56
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,975
12 And now I, Jacob, spake many more things unto

57
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:11,975
 the people of Nephi, warning them against

58
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:13,975
 fornication and lasciviousness, and every kind of sin,

59
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:15,975
 telling them the awful consequences of them

60
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,282
13 And a hundredth part of the proceedings of this

61
00:00:17,282 --> 00:00:18,615
 people, which now began to be numerous, cannot be

62
00:00:18,615 --> 00:00:19,948
 written upon these plates; but many of their

63
00:00:19,948 --> 00:00:21,281
 proceedings are written upon the larger plates, and

64
00:00:21,281 --> 00:00:22,614
 their wars, and their contentions, and the reigns of

65
00:00:22,614 --> 00:00:23,947
 their kings

66
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:24,257
14 These plates are called the plates of Jacob,

67
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:24,59
 and they were made by the hand of Nephi. And I make

68
00:00:24,59 --> 00:00:24,923
 an end of speaking these words.
