00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 3 The pure in heart receive the pleasing

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
word of God—Lamanite righteousness exceeds that

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of the Nephites—Jacob warns against fornication,

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:08:27,
lasciviousness, and every sin. About 544–421 B.C. 

5
00:08:27,0 --> 00:08:27,0
1 But behold, I, Jacob, would speak unto you

6
00:08:27,0 --> 00:08:27,0
that are pure in heart. Look unto God with

7
00:08:27,0 --> 00:08:27,0
firmness of mind, and pray unto him with exceeding

8
00:08:27,0 --> 00:08:27,0
faith, and he will console you in your

9
00:08:27,0 --> 00:08:27,0
afflictions, and he will plead your cause, and send

10
00:08:27,0 --> 00:08:13,
down justice upon those who seek your destruction.

11
00:08:13,0 --> 00:08:13,0
2 O all ye that are pure in heart, lift

12
00:08:13,0 --> 00:08:13,0
up your heads and receive the pleasing

13
00:08:13,0 --> 00:08:13,0
word of God, and feast upon his love; for

14
00:08:13,0 --> 00:09:57,
ye may, if your minds are firm, forever.

15
00:09:57,0 --> 00:09:57,0
3 But, wo, wo, unto you that are not

16
00:09:57,0 --> 00:09:57,0
pure in heart, that are filthy this

17
00:09:57,0 --> 00:09:57,0
day before God; for except ye

18
00:09:57,0 --> 00:09:57,0
repent the land is cursed for your sakes;

19
00:09:57,0 --> 00:09:57,0
and the Lamanites, which are not

20
00:09:57,0 --> 00:09:57,0
filthy like unto you, nevertheless

21
00:09:57,0 --> 00:09:57,0
they are cursed with a sore cursing,

22
00:09:57,0 --> 00:13:28,
shall scourge you even unto destruction.

23
00:13:28,0 --> 00:13:28,0
4 And the time speedily cometh,

24
00:13:28,0 --> 00:13:28,0
that except ye repent they shall

25
00:13:28,0 --> 00:13:28,0
possess the land of your

26
00:13:28,0 --> 00:13:28,0
inheritance, and the Lord God will lead

27
00:13:28,0 --> 00:15:56,
away the righteous out from among you.

28
00:15:56,0 --> 00:15:56,0
5 Behold, the Lamanites your

29
00:15:56,0 --> 00:15:56,0
brethren, whom ye hate because of

30
00:15:56,0 --> 00:15:56,0
their filthiness and the cursing

31
00:15:56,0 --> 00:15:56,0
which hath come upon their

32
00:15:56,0 --> 00:15:56,0
skins, are more righteous than you;

33
00:15:56,0 --> 00:15:56,0
for they have not forgotten the

34
00:15:56,0 --> 00:15:56,0
commandment of the Lord, which

35
00:15:56,0 --> 00:15:56,0
was given unto our father—that

36
00:15:56,0 --> 00:15:56,0
they should have save it were one

37
00:15:56,0 --> 00:15:56,0
wife, and concubines they should

38
00:15:56,0 --> 00:15:56,0
have none, and there should not

39
00:15:56,0 --> 00:16:26,
be whoredoms committed among them.

40
00:16:26,0 --> 00:16:26,0
6 And now, this commandment

41
00:16:26,0 --> 00:16:26,0
they observe to keep;

42
00:16:26,0 --> 00:16:26,0
wherefore, because of this

43
00:16:26,0 --> 00:16:26,0
observance, in keeping this

44
00:16:26,0 --> 00:16:26,0
commandment, the Lord God will not

45
00:16:26,0 --> 00:16:26,0
destroy them, but will be merciful

46
00:16:26,0 --> 00:16:26,0
unto them; and one day they

47
00:16:26,0 --> 00:15:58,
shall become a blessed people.

48
00:15:58,0 --> 00:15:58,0
7 Behold, their husbands

49
00:15:58,0 --> 00:15:58,0
love their wives, and their

50
00:15:58,0 --> 00:15:58,0
wives love their husbands; and

51
00:15:58,0 --> 00:15:58,0
their husbands and their

52
00:15:58,0 --> 00:15:58,0
wives love their children; and

53
00:15:58,0 --> 00:15:58,0
their unbelief and their

54
00:15:58,0 --> 00:15:58,0
hatred towards you is because

55
00:15:58,0 --> 00:15:58,0
of the iniquity of their

56
00:15:58,0 --> 00:15:58,0
fathers; wherefore, how much

57
00:15:58,0 --> 00:15:58,0
better are you than they, in

58
00:15:58,0 --> 00:20:27,
the sight of your great Creator?

59
00:20:27,0 --> 00:20:27,0
8 O my brethren, I fear

60
00:20:27,0 --> 00:20:27,0
that unless ye shall

61
00:20:27,0 --> 00:20:27,0
repent of your sins that

62
00:20:27,0 --> 00:20:27,0
their skins will be whiter

63
00:20:27,0 --> 00:20:27,0
than yours, when ye

64
00:20:27,0 --> 00:20:27,0
shall be brought with them

65
00:20:27,0 --> 00:19:59,
before the throne of God.

66
00:19:59,0 --> 00:19:59,0
9 Wherefore, a

67
00:19:59,0 --> 00:19:59,0
commandment I give unto you,

68
00:19:59,0 --> 00:19:59,0
which is the word of

69
00:19:59,0 --> 00:19:59,0
God, that ye revile no

70
00:19:59,0 --> 00:19:59,0
more against them

71
00:19:59,0 --> 00:19:59,0
because of the darkness of

72
00:19:59,0 --> 00:19:59,0
their skins; neither

73
00:19:59,0 --> 00:19:59,0
shall ye revile

74
00:19:59,0 --> 00:19:59,0
against them because of

75
00:19:59,0 --> 00:19:59,0
their filthiness; but ye

76
00:19:59,0 --> 00:19:59,0
shall remember your own

77
00:19:59,0 --> 00:19:59,0
filthiness, and

78
00:19:59,0 --> 00:19:59,0
remember that their

79
00:19:59,0 --> 00:22:11,
filthiness came because of their fathers.

80
00:22:11,0 --> 00:22:11,0
10 Wherefore, ye

81
00:22:11,0 --> 00:22:11,0
shall remember your

82
00:22:11,0 --> 00:22:11,0
children, how that ye

83
00:22:11,0 --> 00:22:11,0
have grieved their

84
00:22:11,0 --> 00:22:11,0
hearts because of the

85
00:22:11,0 --> 00:22:11,0
example that ye have

86
00:22:11,0 --> 00:22:11,0
set before them;

87
00:22:11,0 --> 00:22:11,0
and also, remember

88
00:22:11,0 --> 00:22:11,0
that ye may, because of

89
00:22:11,0 --> 00:22:11,0
your filthiness,

90
00:22:11,0 --> 00:22:11,0
bring your children

91
00:22:11,0 --> 00:22:11,0
unto destruction, and

92
00:22:11,0 --> 00:22:11,0
their sins be heaped

93
00:22:11,0 --> 00:21:43,
upon your heads at the last day.

94
00:21:43,0 --> 00:21:43,0
11 O my brethren,

95
00:21:43,0 --> 00:21:43,0
hearken unto my

96
00:21:43,0 --> 00:21:43,0
words; arouse the

97
00:21:43,0 --> 00:21:43,0
faculties of your

98
00:21:43,0 --> 00:21:43,0
souls; shake

99
00:21:43,0 --> 00:21:43,0
yourselves that ye may

100
00:21:43,0 --> 00:21:43,0
awake from the

101
00:21:43,0 --> 00:21:43,0
slumber of death; and

102
00:21:43,0 --> 00:21:43,0
loose yourselves

103
00:21:43,0 --> 00:21:43,0
from the pains of

104
00:21:43,0 --> 00:21:43,0
hell that ye may not

105
00:21:43,0 --> 00:21:43,0
become angels to

106
00:21:43,0 --> 00:21:43,0
the devil, to be

107
00:21:43,0 --> 00:21:43,0
cast into that lake

108
00:21:43,0 --> 00:21:43,0
of fire and

109
00:21:43,0 --> 00:21:15,
brimstone which is the second death.

110
00:21:15,0 --> 00:21:15,0
12 And now I,

111
00:21:15,0 --> 00:21:15,0
Jacob, spake many

112
00:21:15,0 --> 00:21:15,0
more things unto

113
00:21:15,0 --> 00:21:15,0
the people of

114
00:21:15,0 --> 00:21:15,0
Nephi, warning them

115
00:21:15,0 --> 00:21:15,0
against fornication

116
00:21:15,0 --> 00:21:15,0
and

117
00:21:15,0 --> 00:21:15,0
lasciviousness, and every

118
00:21:15,0 --> 00:21:15,0
kind of sin, telling

119
00:21:15,0 --> 00:21:15,0
them the awful

120
00:21:15,0 --> 00:20:47,
consequences of them.

121
00:20:47,0 --> 00:20:47,0
13 And a

122
00:20:47,0 --> 00:20:47,0
hundredth part of the

123
00:20:47,0 --> 00:20:47,0
proceedings of

124
00:20:47,0 --> 00:20:47,0
this people, which

125
00:20:47,0 --> 00:20:47,0
now began to be

126
00:20:47,0 --> 00:20:47,0
numerous,

127
00:20:47,0 --> 00:20:47,0
cannot be written

128
00:20:47,0 --> 00:20:47,0
upon these plates;

129
00:20:47,0 --> 00:20:47,0
but many of

130
00:20:47,0 --> 00:20:47,0
their proceedings

131
00:20:47,0 --> 00:20:47,0
are written upon

132
00:20:47,0 --> 00:20:47,0
the larger

133
00:20:47,0 --> 00:20:47,0
plates, and their

134
00:20:47,0 --> 00:20:47,0
wars, and their

135
00:20:47,0 --> 00:20:47,0
contentions, and the

136
00:20:47,0 --> 00:20:19,
reigns of their kings.

137
00:20:19,0 --> 00:20:19,0
14 These

138
00:20:19,0 --> 00:20:19,0
plates are called

139
00:20:19,0 --> 00:20:19,0
the plates of

140
00:20:19,0 --> 00:20:19,0
Jacob, and they

141
00:20:19,0 --> 00:20:19,0
were made by

142
00:20:19,0 --> 00:20:19,0
the hand of

143
00:20:19,0 --> 00:20:19,0
Nephi. And I

144
00:20:19,0 --> 00:20:19,0
make an end of

145
00:20:19,0 --> 00:19:51,
speaking these words.
