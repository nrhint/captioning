Chapter 3 The pure in heart receive the pleasing

2
00:00:07,0 --> 00:00:14,0
word of God—Lamanite righteousness exceeds that

3
00:00:14,0 --> 00:00:21,0
of the Nephites—Jacob warns against fornication,

4
00:00:21,0 --> 00:00:28,328
lasciviousness, and every sin. About 544–421 B.C. 

5
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
1 But behold, I, Jacob, would speak unto you

6
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
that are pure in heart. Look unto God with

7
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
firmness of mind, and pray unto him with exceeding

8
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
faith, and he will console you in your

9
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
afflictions, and he will plead your cause, and send

10
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
down justice upon those who seek your destruction.

11
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
2 O all ye that are pure in heart, lift

12
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
up your heads and receive the pleasing

13
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
word of God, and feast upon his love; for

14
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
ye may, if your minds are firm, forever.

15
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
3 But, wo, wo, unto you that are not

16
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
pure in heart, that are filthy this

17
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
day before God; for except ye

18
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
repent the land is cursed for your sakes;

19
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
and the Lamanites, which are not

20
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
filthy like unto you, nevertheless

21
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
they are cursed with a sore cursing,

22
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
shall scourge you even unto destruction.

23
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
4 And the time speedily cometh,

24
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
that except ye repent they shall

25
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
possess the land of your

26
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
inheritance, and the Lord God will lead

27
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
away the righteous out from among you.

28
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
5 Behold, the Lamanites your

29
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
brethren, whom ye hate because of

30
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
their filthiness and the cursing

31
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
which hath come upon their

32
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
skins, are more righteous than you;

33
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
for they have not forgotten the

34
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
commandment of the Lord, which

35
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
was given unto our father—that

36
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
they should have save it were one

37
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
wife, and concubines they should

38
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
have none, and there should not

39
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
be whoredoms committed among them.

40
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
6 And now, this commandment

41
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
they observe to keep;

42
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
wherefore, because of this

43
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
observance, in keeping this

44
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
commandment, the Lord God will not

45
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
destroy them, but will be merciful

46
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
unto them; and one day they

47
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
shall become a blessed people.

48
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
7 Behold, their husbands

49
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
love their wives, and their

50
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
wives love their husbands; and

51
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
their husbands and their

52
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
wives love their children; and

53
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
their unbelief and their

54
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
hatred towards you is because

55
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
of the iniquity of their

56
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
fathers; wherefore, how much

57
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
better are you than they, in

58
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
the sight of your great Creator?

59
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
8 O my brethren, I fear

60
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
that unless ye shall

61
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
repent of your sins that

62
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
their skins will be whiter

63
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
than yours, when ye

64
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
shall be brought with them

65
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
before the throne of God.

66
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
9 Wherefore, a

67
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
commandment I give unto you,

68
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
which is the word of

69
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
God, that ye revile no

70
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
more against them

71
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
because of the darkness of

72
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
their skins; neither

73
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
shall ye revile

74
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
against them because of

75
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
their filthiness; but ye

76
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
shall remember your own

77
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
filthiness, and

78
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
remember that their

79
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
filthiness came because of their fathers.

80
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
10 Wherefore, ye

81
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
shall remember your

82
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
children, how that ye

83
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
have grieved their

84
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
hearts because of the

85
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
example that ye have

86
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
set before them;

87
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
and also, remember

88
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
that ye may, because of

89
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
your filthiness,

90
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
bring your children

91
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
unto destruction, and

92
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
their sins be heaped

93
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
upon your heads at the last day.

94
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
11 O my brethren,

95
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
hearken unto my

96
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
words; arouse the

97
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
faculties of your

98
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
souls; shake

99
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
yourselves that ye may

100
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
awake from the

101
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
slumber of death; and

102
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
loose yourselves

103
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
from the pains of

104
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
hell that ye may not

105
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
become angels to

106
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
the devil, to be

107
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
cast into that lake

108
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
of fire and

109
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
brimstone which is the second death.

110
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
12 And now I,

111
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
Jacob, spake many

112
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
more things unto

113
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
the people of

114
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
Nephi, warning them

115
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
against fornication

116
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
and

117
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
lasciviousness, and every

118
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
kind of sin, telling

119
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
them the awful

120
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
consequences of them.

121
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
13 And a

122
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
hundredth part of the

123
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
proceedings of

124
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
this people, which

125
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
now began to be

126
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
numerous,

127
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
cannot be written

128
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
upon these plates;

129
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
but many of

130
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
their proceedings

131
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
are written upon

132
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
the larger

133
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
plates, and their

134
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
wars, and their

135
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
contentions, and the

136
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
reigns of their kings.

137
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
14 These

138
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
plates are called

139
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
the plates of

140
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
Jacob, and they

141
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
were made by

142
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
the hand of

143
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
Nephi. And I

144
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
make an end of

145
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:28,328
speaking these words.
