00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
The Book of Jacob the Brother of NephiThe words

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of his preaching unto his brethren. He

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
confoundeth a man who seeketh to overthrow the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
doctrine of Christ. A few words concerning the history

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of the people of Nephi.Chapter 1 Jacob and

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Joseph seek to persuade men to believe in Christ

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and keep His commandments—Nephi dies—Wickedness

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:05:43,
prevails among the Nephites. About 544–421 B.C. 

9
00:05:43,0 --> 00:05:43,0
1 For behold, it came to pass that fifty and

10
00:05:43,0 --> 00:05:43,0
five years had passed away from the time that

11
00:05:43,0 --> 00:05:43,0
Lehi left Jerusalem; wherefore, Nephi gave

12
00:05:43,0 --> 00:05:43,0
me, Jacob, a commandment concerning the small

13
00:05:43,0 --> 00:10:39,
plates, upon which these things are engraven.

14
00:10:39,0 --> 00:10:39,0
2 And he gave me, Jacob, a commandment that

15
00:10:39,0 --> 00:10:39,0
I should write upon these plates a few of

16
00:10:39,0 --> 00:10:39,0
the things which I considered to be most

17
00:10:39,0 --> 00:10:39,0
precious; that I should not touch, save it

18
00:10:39,0 --> 00:10:39,0
were lightly, concerning the history of this

19
00:10:39,0 --> 00:11:23,
people which are called the people of Nephi.

20
00:11:23,0 --> 00:11:23,0
3 For he said that the history of his

21
00:11:23,0 --> 00:11:23,0
people should be engraven upon his

22
00:11:23,0 --> 00:11:23,0
other plates, and that I should preserve

23
00:11:23,0 --> 00:11:23,0
these plates and hand them down unto

24
00:11:23,0 --> 00:14:54,
my seed, from generation to generation.

25
00:14:54,0 --> 00:14:54,0
4 And if there were preaching which

26
00:14:54,0 --> 00:14:54,0
was sacred, or revelation which was

27
00:14:54,0 --> 00:14:54,0
great, or prophesying, that I should

28
00:14:54,0 --> 00:14:54,0
engraven the heads of them upon

29
00:14:54,0 --> 00:14:54,0
these plates, and touch upon them as

30
00:14:54,0 --> 00:14:54,0
much as it were possible, for Christ’s

31
00:14:54,0 --> 00:16:38,
sake, and for the sake of our people.

32
00:16:38,0 --> 00:16:38,0
5 For because of faith and great

33
00:16:38,0 --> 00:16:38,0
anxiety, it truly had been made

34
00:16:38,0 --> 00:16:38,0
manifest unto us concerning our people,

35
00:16:38,0 --> 00:24:08,
what things should happen unto them.

36
00:24:08,0 --> 00:24:08,0
6 And we also had many

37
00:24:08,0 --> 00:24:08,0
revelations, and the spirit of much

38
00:24:08,0 --> 00:24:08,0
prophecy; wherefore, we knew of Christ

39
00:24:08,0 --> 00:28:07,
and his kingdom, which should come.

40
00:28:07,0 --> 00:28:07,0
7 Wherefore we labored

41
00:28:07,0 --> 00:28:07,0
diligently among our people, that we

42
00:28:07,0 --> 00:28:07,0
might persuade them to come unto

43
00:28:07,0 --> 00:28:07,0
Christ, and partake of the

44
00:28:07,0 --> 00:28:07,0
goodness of God, that they might

45
00:28:07,0 --> 00:28:07,0
enter into his rest, lest by any

46
00:28:07,0 --> 00:28:07,0
means he should swear in his

47
00:28:07,0 --> 00:28:07,0
wrath they should not enter in,

48
00:28:07,0 --> 00:28:07,0
as in the provocation in the

49
00:28:07,0 --> 00:28:07,0
days of temptation while the

50
00:28:07,0 --> 00:34:18,
children of Israel were in the wilderness.

51
00:34:18,0 --> 00:34:18,0
8 Wherefore, we would to God

52
00:34:18,0 --> 00:34:18,0
that we could persuade all men

53
00:34:18,0 --> 00:34:18,0
not to rebel against God, to

54
00:34:18,0 --> 00:34:18,0
provoke him to anger, but that all

55
00:34:18,0 --> 00:34:18,0
men would believe in Christ,

56
00:34:18,0 --> 00:34:18,0
and view his death, and suffer

57
00:34:18,0 --> 00:34:18,0
his cross and bear the shame of

58
00:34:18,0 --> 00:34:18,0
the world; wherefore, I, Jacob,

59
00:34:18,0 --> 00:34:18,0
take it upon me to fulfil the

60
00:34:18,0 --> 00:33:50,
commandment of my brother Nephi.

61
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
9 Now Nephi began to be old,

62
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
and he saw that he must soon

63
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
die; wherefore, he anointed a

64
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
man to be a king and a ruler

65
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
over his people now,

66
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:22,
according to the reigns of the kings.

67
00:33:22,0 --> 00:33:22,0
10 The people having loved

68
00:33:22,0 --> 00:33:22,0
Nephi exceedingly, he

69
00:33:22,0 --> 00:33:22,0
having been a great protector

70
00:33:22,0 --> 00:33:22,0
for them, having wielded the

71
00:33:22,0 --> 00:33:22,0
sword of Laban in their

72
00:33:22,0 --> 00:33:22,0
defence, and having labored in

73
00:33:22,0 --> 00:32:54,
all his days for their welfare—

74
00:32:54,0 --> 00:32:54,0
11 Wherefore, the people

75
00:32:54,0 --> 00:32:54,0
were desirous to retain in

76
00:32:54,0 --> 00:32:54,0
remembrance his name. And

77
00:32:54,0 --> 00:32:54,0
whoso should reign in his

78
00:32:54,0 --> 00:32:54,0
stead were called by the

79
00:32:54,0 --> 00:32:54,0
people, second Nephi, third

80
00:32:54,0 --> 00:32:54,0
Nephi, and so forth, according

81
00:32:54,0 --> 00:32:54,0
to the reigns of the kings;

82
00:32:54,0 --> 00:32:54,0
and thus they were called

83
00:32:54,0 --> 00:32:54,0
by the people, let them be

84
00:32:54,0 --> 00:33:08,
of whatever name they would.

85
00:33:08,0 --> 00:33:08,0
12 And it came to

86
00:33:08,0 --> 00:34:06,
pass that Nephi died.

87
00:34:06,0 --> 00:34:06,0
13 Now the people

88
00:34:06,0 --> 00:34:06,0
which were not

89
00:34:06,0 --> 00:34:06,0
Lamanites were

90
00:34:06,0 --> 00:34:06,0
Nephites;

91
00:34:06,0 --> 00:34:06,0
nevertheless, they were

92
00:34:06,0 --> 00:34:06,0
called Nephites,

93
00:34:06,0 --> 00:34:06,0
Jacobites,

94
00:34:06,0 --> 00:34:06,0
Josephites, Zoramites,

95
00:34:06,0 --> 00:34:06,0
Lamanites,

96
00:34:06,0 --> 00:33:38,
Lemuelites, and Ishmaelites.

97
00:33:38,0 --> 00:33:38,0
14 But I, Jacob,

98
00:33:38,0 --> 00:33:38,0
shall not

99
00:33:38,0 --> 00:33:38,0
hereafter distinguish

100
00:33:38,0 --> 00:33:38,0
them by these

101
00:33:38,0 --> 00:33:38,0
names, but I

102
00:33:38,0 --> 00:33:38,0
shall call them

103
00:33:38,0 --> 00:33:38,0
Lamanites that seek

104
00:33:38,0 --> 00:33:38,0
to destroy the

105
00:33:38,0 --> 00:33:38,0
people of Nephi,

106
00:33:38,0 --> 00:33:38,0
and those who

107
00:33:38,0 --> 00:33:38,0
are friendly to

108
00:33:38,0 --> 00:33:38,0
Nephi I shall call

109
00:33:38,0 --> 00:33:38,0
Nephites, or

110
00:33:38,0 --> 00:33:38,0
the people of

111
00:33:38,0 --> 00:33:38,0
Nephi, according to

112
00:33:38,0 --> 00:33:10,
the reigns of the kings.

113
00:33:10,0 --> 00:33:10,0
15 And now it

114
00:33:10,0 --> 00:33:10,0
came to pass

115
00:33:10,0 --> 00:33:10,0
that the people of

116
00:33:10,0 --> 00:33:10,0
Nephi, under

117
00:33:10,0 --> 00:33:10,0
the reign of the

118
00:33:10,0 --> 00:33:10,0
second king,

119
00:33:10,0 --> 00:33:10,0
began to grow

120
00:33:10,0 --> 00:33:10,0
hard in their

121
00:33:10,0 --> 00:33:10,0
hearts, and

122
00:33:10,0 --> 00:33:10,0
indulge themselves

123
00:33:10,0 --> 00:33:10,0
somewhat in

124
00:33:10,0 --> 00:33:10,0
wicked practices,

125
00:33:10,0 --> 00:33:10,0
such as like unto

126
00:33:10,0 --> 00:33:10,0
David of old

127
00:33:10,0 --> 00:33:10,0
desiring many

128
00:33:10,0 --> 00:33:10,0
wives and

129
00:33:10,0 --> 00:34:08,
concubines, and also Solomon, his son.

130
00:34:08,0 --> 00:34:08,0
16 Yea, and

131
00:34:08,0 --> 00:34:08,0
they also began

132
00:34:08,0 --> 00:34:08,0
to search much

133
00:34:08,0 --> 00:34:08,0
gold and

134
00:34:08,0 --> 00:34:08,0
silver, and began

135
00:34:08,0 --> 00:34:08,0
to be lifted

136
00:34:08,0 --> 00:33:40,
up somewhat in pride.

137
00:33:40,0 --> 00:33:40,0
17 Wherefore

138
00:33:40,0 --> 00:33:40,0
I, Jacob,

139
00:33:40,0 --> 00:33:40,0
gave unto them

140
00:33:40,0 --> 00:33:40,0
these words as

141
00:33:40,0 --> 00:33:40,0
I taught

142
00:33:40,0 --> 00:33:40,0
them in the

143
00:33:40,0 --> 00:33:40,0
temple, having

144
00:33:40,0 --> 00:33:40,0
first obtained

145
00:33:40,0 --> 00:33:40,0
mine errand

146
00:33:40,0 --> 00:33:12,
from the Lord.

147
00:33:12,0 --> 00:33:12,0
18 For I,

148
00:33:12,0 --> 00:33:12,0
Jacob, and

149
00:33:12,0 --> 00:33:12,0
my brother

150
00:33:12,0 --> 00:33:12,0
Joseph had

151
00:33:12,0 --> 00:33:12,0
been

152
00:33:12,0 --> 00:33:12,0
consecrated

153
00:33:12,0 --> 00:33:12,0
priests and

154
00:33:12,0 --> 00:33:12,0
teachers of this

155
00:33:12,0 --> 00:33:12,0
people, by

156
00:33:12,0 --> 00:34:10,
the hand of Nephi.

157
00:34:10,0 --> 00:34:10,0
19 And we

158
00:34:10,0 --> 00:34:10,0
did

159
00:34:10,0 --> 00:34:10,0
magnify our

160
00:34:10,0 --> 00:34:10,0
office unto

161
00:34:10,0 --> 00:34:10,0
the Lord,

162
00:34:10,0 --> 00:34:10,0
taking upon

163
00:34:10,0 --> 00:34:10,0
us the

164
00:34:10,0 --> 00:34:10,0


165
00:34:10,0 --> 00:34:10,0
responsibility,

166
00:34:10,0 --> 00:34:10,0
answering the

167
00:34:10,0 --> 00:34:10,0
sins of the

168
00:34:10,0 --> 00:34:10,0
people upon

169
00:34:10,0 --> 00:34:10,0
our own

170
00:34:10,0 --> 00:34:10,0
heads if we

171
00:34:10,0 --> 00:34:10,0
did not

172
00:34:10,0 --> 00:34:10,0
teach them

173
00:34:10,0 --> 00:34:10,0
the word

174
00:34:10,0 --> 00:34:10,0
of God with

175
00:34:10,0 --> 00:34:10,0
all

176
00:34:10,0 --> 00:34:10,0
diligence;

177
00:34:10,0 --> 00:34:10,0
wherefore, by

178
00:34:10,0 --> 00:34:10,0
laboring

179
00:34:10,0 --> 00:34:10,0
with our

180
00:34:10,0 --> 00:34:10,0
might their

181
00:34:10,0 --> 00:34:10,0
blood

182
00:34:10,0 --> 00:34:10,0
might not come

183
00:34:10,0 --> 00:34:10,0
upon our

184
00:34:10,0 --> 00:34:10,0
garments;

185
00:34:10,0 --> 00:34:10,0
otherwise

186
00:34:10,0 --> 00:34:10,0
their

187
00:34:10,0 --> 00:34:10,0
blood would

188
00:34:10,0 --> 00:34:10,0
come upon

189
00:34:10,0 --> 00:34:10,0
our

190
00:34:10,0 --> 00:34:10,0
garments, and we

191
00:34:10,0 --> 00:33:42,
would not be found spotless at the last day.
