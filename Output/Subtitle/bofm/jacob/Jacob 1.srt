00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,125
The Book of Jacob the Brother of NephiThe words

2
00:00:01,125 --> 00:00:02,25
of his preaching unto his brethren. He

3
00:00:02,25 --> 00:00:03,375
confoundeth a man who seeketh to overthrow the

4
00:00:03,375 --> 00:00:04,5
doctrine of Christ. A few words concerning the history

5
00:00:04,5 --> 00:00:05,625
of the people of Nephi.Chapter 1 Jacob and

6
00:00:05,625 --> 00:00:06,75
Joseph seek to persuade men to believe in Christ

7
00:00:06,75 --> 00:00:07,875
and keep His commandments—Nephi dies—Wickedness

8
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:09,91
prevails among the Nephites. About 544–421 B.C. 

9
00:00:09,91 --> 00:00:09,91
1 For behold, it came to pass that fifty and

10
00:00:09,91 --> 00:00:09,91
five years had passed away from the time that

11
00:00:09,91 --> 00:00:09,91
Lehi left Jerusalem; wherefore, Nephi gave

12
00:00:09,91 --> 00:00:09,91
me, Jacob, a commandment concerning the small

13
00:00:09,91 --> 00:00:09,443
plates, upon which these things are engraven.

14
00:00:09,443 --> 00:00:12,61
2 And he gave me, Jacob, a commandment that

15
00:00:12,61 --> 00:00:15,777
I should write upon these plates a few of

16
00:00:15,777 --> 00:00:18,944
the things which I considered to be most

17
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:22,111
precious; that I should not touch, save it

18
00:00:22,111 --> 00:00:25,278
were lightly, concerning the history of this

19
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:28,395
people which are called the people of Nephi.

20
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:29,195
3 For he said that the history of his

21
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:29,995
people should be engraven upon his

22
00:00:29,995 --> 00:00:30,795
other plates, and that I should preserve

23
00:00:30,795 --> 00:00:31,595
these plates and hand them down unto

24
00:00:31,595 --> 00:00:32,799
my seed, from generation to generation.

25
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,942
4 And if there were preaching which

26
00:00:36,942 --> 00:00:41,085
was sacred, or revelation which was

27
00:00:41,085 --> 00:00:45,228
great, or prophesying, that I should

28
00:00:45,228 --> 00:00:49,371
engraven the heads of them upon

29
00:00:49,371 --> 00:00:53,514
these plates, and touch upon them as

30
00:00:53,514 --> 00:00:57,657
much as it were possible, for Christ’s

31
00:00:57,657 --> 00:01:01,094
sake, and for the sake of our people.

32
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:01,844
5 For because of faith and great

33
00:01:01,844 --> 00:01:02,594
anxiety, it truly had been made

34
00:01:02,594 --> 00:01:03,344
manifest unto us concerning our people,

35
00:01:03,344 --> 00:01:04,564
what things should happen unto them.

36
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:05,064
6 And we also had many

37
00:01:05,064 --> 00:01:05,564
revelations, and the spirit of much

38
00:01:05,564 --> 00:01:06,064
prophecy; wherefore, we knew of Christ

39
00:01:06,064 --> 00:01:06,967
and his kingdom, which should come.

40
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:07,058
7 Wherefore we labored

41
00:01:07,058 --> 00:01:07,149
diligently among our people, that we

42
00:01:07,149 --> 00:01:07,24
might persuade them to come unto

43
00:01:07,24 --> 00:01:07,331
Christ, and partake of the

44
00:01:07,331 --> 00:01:07,422
goodness of God, that they might

45
00:01:07,422 --> 00:01:07,513
enter into his rest, lest by any

46
00:01:07,513 --> 00:01:07,604
means he should swear in his

47
00:01:07,604 --> 00:01:07,695
wrath they should not enter in,

48
00:01:07,695 --> 00:01:07,786
as in the provocation in the

49
00:01:07,786 --> 00:01:07,877
days of temptation while the

50
00:01:07,877 --> 00:01:07,968
children of Israel were in the wilderness.

51
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:07,968
8 Wherefore, we would to God

52
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:07,968
that we could persuade all men

53
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:07,968
not to rebel against God, to

54
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:07,968
provoke him to anger, but that all

55
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:07,968
men would believe in Christ,

56
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:07,968
and view his death, and suffer

57
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:07,968
his cross and bear the shame of

58
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:07,968
the world; wherefore, I, Jacob,

59
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:07,968
take it upon me to fulfil the

60
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:07,034
commandment of my brother Nephi.

61
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:07,367
9 Now Nephi began to be old,

62
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:07,7
and he saw that he must soon

63
00:01:07,7 --> 00:01:08,033
die; wherefore, he anointed a

64
00:01:08,033 --> 00:01:08,366
man to be a king and a ruler

65
00:01:08,366 --> 00:01:08,699
over his people now,

66
00:01:08,699 --> 00:01:09,436
according to the reigns of the kings.

67
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:13,436
10 The people having loved

68
00:01:13,436 --> 00:01:17,436
Nephi exceedingly, he

69
00:01:17,436 --> 00:01:21,436
having been a great protector

70
00:01:21,436 --> 00:01:25,436
for them, having wielded the

71
00:01:25,436 --> 00:01:29,436
sword of Laban in their

72
00:01:29,436 --> 00:01:33,436
defence, and having labored in

73
00:01:33,436 --> 00:01:37,731
all his days for their welfare—

74
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:39,731
11 Wherefore, the people

75
00:01:39,731 --> 00:01:41,731
were desirous to retain in

76
00:01:41,731 --> 00:01:43,731
remembrance his name. And

77
00:01:43,731 --> 00:01:45,731
whoso should reign in his

78
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,731
stead were called by the

79
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:49,731
people, second Nephi, third

80
00:01:49,731 --> 00:01:51,731
Nephi, and so forth, according

81
00:01:51,731 --> 00:01:53,731
to the reigns of the kings;

82
00:01:53,731 --> 00:01:55,731
and thus they were called

83
00:01:55,731 --> 00:01:57,731
by the people, let them be

84
00:01:57,731 --> 00:01:59,086
of whatever name they would.

85
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:11,586
12 And it came to

86
00:02:11,586 --> 00:02:24,911
pass that Nephi died.

87
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:25,311
13 Now the people

88
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:25,711
which were not

89
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:26,111
Lamanites were

90
00:02:26,111 --> 00:02:26,511
Nephites;

91
00:02:26,511 --> 00:02:26,911
nevertheless, they were

92
00:02:26,911 --> 00:02:27,311
called Nephites,

93
00:02:27,311 --> 00:02:27,711
Jacobites,

94
00:02:27,711 --> 00:02:28,111
Josephites, Zoramites,

95
00:02:28,111 --> 00:02:28,511
Lamanites,

96
00:02:28,511 --> 00:02:28,382
Lemuelites, and Ishmaelites.

97
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:28,882
14 But I, Jacob,

98
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:29,382
shall not

99
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:29,882
hereafter distinguish

100
00:02:29,882 --> 00:02:30,382
them by these

101
00:02:30,382 --> 00:02:30,882
names, but I

102
00:02:30,882 --> 00:02:31,382
shall call them

103
00:02:31,382 --> 00:02:31,882
Lamanites that seek

104
00:02:31,882 --> 00:02:32,382
to destroy the

105
00:02:32,382 --> 00:02:32,882
people of Nephi,

106
00:02:32,882 --> 00:02:33,382
and those who

107
00:02:33,382 --> 00:02:33,882
are friendly to

108
00:02:33,882 --> 00:02:34,382
Nephi I shall call

109
00:02:34,382 --> 00:02:34,882
Nephites, or

110
00:02:34,882 --> 00:02:35,382
the people of

111
00:02:35,382 --> 00:02:35,882
Nephi, according to

112
00:02:35,882 --> 00:02:36,356
the reigns of the kings.

113
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:36,297
15 And now it

114
00:02:36,297 --> 00:02:36,238
came to pass

115
00:02:36,238 --> 00:02:36,179
that the people of

116
00:02:36,179 --> 00:02:36,12
Nephi, under

117
00:02:36,12 --> 00:02:36,061
the reign of the

118
00:02:36,061 --> 00:02:36,002
second king,

119
00:02:36,002 --> 00:02:35,943
began to grow

120
00:02:35,943 --> 00:02:35,884
hard in their

121
00:02:35,884 --> 00:02:35,825
hearts, and

122
00:02:35,825 --> 00:02:35,766
indulge themselves

123
00:02:35,766 --> 00:02:35,707
somewhat in

124
00:02:35,707 --> 00:02:35,648
wicked practices,

125
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:35,589
such as like unto

126
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:35,53
David of old

127
00:02:35,53 --> 00:02:35,471
desiring many

128
00:02:35,471 --> 00:02:35,412
wives and

129
00:02:35,412 --> 00:02:35,422
concubines, and also Solomon, his son.

130
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:35,279
16 Yea, and

131
00:02:35,279 --> 00:02:35,136
they also began

132
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:34,993
to search much

133
00:02:34,993 --> 00:02:34,85
gold and

134
00:02:34,85 --> 00:02:34,707
silver, and began

135
00:02:34,707 --> 00:02:34,564
to be lifted

136
00:02:34,564 --> 00:02:34,955
up somewhat in pride.

137
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:34,955
17 Wherefore

138
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:34,955
I, Jacob,

139
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:34,955
gave unto them

140
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:34,955
these words as

141
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:34,955
I taught

142
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:34,955
them in the

143
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:34,955
temple, having

144
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:34,955
first obtained

145
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:34,955
mine errand

146
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:34,488
from the Lord.

147
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:34,688
18 For I,

148
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:34,888
Jacob, and

149
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:35,088
my brother

150
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:35,288
Joseph had

151
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:35,488
been

152
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:35,688
consecrated

153
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:35,888
priests and

154
00:02:35,888 --> 00:02:36,088
teachers of this

155
00:02:36,088 --> 00:02:36,288
people, by

156
00:02:36,288 --> 00:02:36,89
the hand of Nephi.

157
00:02:36,89 --> 00:02:37,147
19 And we

158
00:02:37,147 --> 00:02:37,404
did

159
00:02:37,404 --> 00:02:37,661
magnify our

160
00:02:37,661 --> 00:02:37,918
office unto

161
00:02:37,918 --> 00:02:38,175
the Lord,

162
00:02:38,175 --> 00:02:38,432
taking upon

163
00:02:38,432 --> 00:02:38,689
us the

164
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:38,946


165
00:02:38,946 --> 00:02:39,203
responsibility,

166
00:02:39,203 --> 00:02:39,46
answering the

167
00:02:39,46 --> 00:02:39,717
sins of the

168
00:02:39,717 --> 00:02:39,974
people upon

169
00:02:39,974 --> 00:02:40,231
our own

170
00:02:40,231 --> 00:02:40,488
heads if we

171
00:02:40,488 --> 00:02:40,745
did not

172
00:02:40,745 --> 00:02:41,002
teach them

173
00:02:41,002 --> 00:02:41,259
the word

174
00:02:41,259 --> 00:02:41,516
of God with

175
00:02:41,516 --> 00:02:41,773
all

176
00:02:41,773 --> 00:02:42,03
diligence;

177
00:02:42,03 --> 00:02:42,287
wherefore, by

178
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:42,544
laboring

179
00:02:42,544 --> 00:02:42,801
with our

180
00:02:42,801 --> 00:02:43,058
might their

181
00:02:43,058 --> 00:02:43,315
blood

182
00:02:43,315 --> 00:02:43,572
might not come

183
00:02:43,572 --> 00:02:43,829
upon our

184
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:44,086
garments;

185
00:02:44,086 --> 00:02:44,343
otherwise

186
00:02:44,343 --> 00:02:44,6
their

187
00:02:44,6 --> 00:02:44,857
blood would

188
00:02:44,857 --> 00:02:45,114
come upon

189
00:02:45,114 --> 00:02:45,371
our

190
00:02:45,371 --> 00:02:45,628
garments, and we

191
00:02:45,628 --> 00:02:45,866
would not be found spotless at the last day.
