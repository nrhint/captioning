00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:04,875
The Book of Jacob the Brother of NephiThe words of

2
00:00:04,875 --> 00:00:09,75
 his preaching unto his brethren. He confoundeth a

3
00:00:09,75 --> 00:00:14,625
 man who seeketh to overthrow the doctrine of

4
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:19,5
 Christ. A few words concerning the history of the

5
00:00:19,5 --> 00:00:24,375
 people of Nephi.Chapter 1 Jacob and Joseph seek to

6
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:29,25
 persuade men to believe in Christ and keep His

7
00:00:29,25 --> 00:00:34,125
 commandments—Nephi dies—Wickedness prevails among the

8
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:39,0
 Nephites. About 544–421 B.C.

9
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,473
1 For behold, it came to pass that fifty and five

10
00:00:41,473 --> 00:00:43,073
 years had passed away from the time that Lehi left

11
00:00:43,073 --> 00:00:44,673
 Jerusalem; wherefore, Nephi gave me, Jacob, a

12
00:00:44,673 --> 00:00:46,273
 commandment concerning the small plates, upon which

13
00:00:46,273 --> 00:00:47,873
 these things are engraven

14
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,181
2 And he gave me, Jacob, a commandment that I

15
00:00:49,181 --> 00:00:50,514
 should write upon these plates a few of the things

16
00:00:50,514 --> 00:00:51,847
 which I considered to be most precious; that I should

17
00:00:51,847 --> 00:00:53,18
 not touch, save it were lightly, concerning the

18
00:00:53,18 --> 00:00:54,513
 history of this people which are called the people

19
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:55,846
 of Nephi

20
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,822
3 For he said that the history of his people

21
00:00:57,822 --> 00:00:59,822
 should be engraven upon his other plates, and that I

22
00:00:59,822 --> 00:01:01,822
 should preserve these plates and hand them down unto

23
00:01:01,822 --> 00:01:03,822
 my seed, from generation to generation

24
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:07,797
4 And if there were preaching which was sacred, or

25
00:01:07,797 --> 00:01:11,797
 revelation which was great, or prophesying, that

26
00:01:11,797 --> 00:01:15,797
 I should engraven the heads of them upon these

27
00:01:15,797 --> 00:01:19,797
 plates, and touch upon them as much as it were

28
00:01:19,797 --> 00:01:23,797
 possible, for Christ’s sake, and for the sake of our

29
00:01:23,797 --> 00:01:27,797
 people

30
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:30,388
5 For because of faith and great anxiety, it truly

31
00:01:30,388 --> 00:01:33,055
 had been made manifest unto us concerning our

32
00:01:33,055 --> 00:01:35,722
 people, what things should happen unto them

33
00:01:35,696 --> 00:02:02,363
6 And we also had many revelations, and the spirit

34
00:02:02,363 --> 00:02:29,03
 of much prophecy; wherefore, we knew of Christ

35
00:02:29,03 --> 00:02:55,697
 and his kingdom, which should come

36
00:02:55,442 --> 00:03:15,299
7 Wherefore we labored diligently among our

37
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:35,156
 people, that we might persuade them to come unto Christ,

38
00:03:35,156 --> 00:03:55,013
 and partake of the goodness of God, that they

39
00:03:55,013 --> 00:04:14,87
 might enter into his rest, lest by any means he

40
00:04:14,87 --> 00:04:34,727
 should swear in his wrath they should not enter in, as

41
00:04:34,727 --> 00:04:54,584
 in the provocation in the days of temptation while

42
00:04:54,584 --> 00:05:14,441
 the children of Israel were in the wilderness

43
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:33,134
8 Wherefore, we would to God that we could

44
00:05:33,134 --> 00:05:51,42
 persuade all men not to rebel against God, to provoke him

45
00:05:51,42 --> 00:06:09,706
 to anger, but that all men would believe in

46
00:06:09,706 --> 00:06:27,992
 Christ, and view his death, and suffer his cross and

47
00:06:27,992 --> 00:06:46,278
 bear the shame of the world; wherefore, I, Jacob,

48
00:06:46,278 --> 00:07:04,564
 take it upon me to fulfil the commandment of my

49
00:07:04,564 --> 00:07:22,85
 brother Nephi

50
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:26,442
9 Now Nephi began to be old, and he saw that he

51
00:07:26,442 --> 00:07:30,442
 must soon die; wherefore, he anointed a man to be a

52
00:07:30,442 --> 00:07:34,442
 king and a ruler over his people now, according to

53
00:07:34,442 --> 00:07:38,442
 the reigns of the kings

54
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:54,391
10 The people having loved Nephi exceedingly, he

55
00:07:54,391 --> 00:08:10,391
 having been a great protector for them, having

56
00:08:10,391 --> 00:08:26,391
 wielded the sword of Laban in their defence, and

57
00:08:26,391 --> 00:08:42,391
 having labored in all his days for their welfare

58
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:47,521
11 Wherefore, the people were desirous to retain

59
00:08:47,521 --> 00:08:52,854
 in remembrance his name. And whoso should reign in

60
00:08:52,854 --> 00:08:58,187
 his stead were called by the people, second Nephi,

61
00:08:58,187 --> 00:09:03,52
 third Nephi, and so forth, according to the

62
00:09:03,52 --> 00:09:08,853
 reigns of the kings; and thus they were called by the

63
00:09:08,853 --> 00:09:14,186
 people, let them be of whatever name they would

64
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:53,087
12 And it came to pass that Nephi died

65
00:09:53,96 --> 00:10:07,96
13 Now the people which were not Lamanites were

66
00:10:07,96 --> 00:10:21,96
 Nephites; nevertheless, they were called Nephites,

67
00:10:21,96 --> 00:10:35,96
 Jacobites, Josephites, Zoramites, Lamanites,

68
00:10:35,96 --> 00:10:49,96
 Lemuelites, and Ishmaelites

69
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:56,449
14 But I, Jacob, shall not hereafter distinguish

70
00:10:56,449 --> 00:11:03,116
 them by these names, but I shall call them

71
00:11:03,116 --> 00:11:09,783
 Lamanites that seek to destroy the people of Nephi, and

72
00:11:09,783 --> 00:11:16,45
 those who are friendly to Nephi I shall call

73
00:11:16,45 --> 00:11:23,117
 Nephites, or the people of Nephi, according to the reigns

74
00:11:23,117 --> 00:11:29,784
 of the kings

75
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,54
17 Wherefore I, Jacob, gave unto them these words

76
00:00:42,54 --> 00:00:45,207
 as I taught them in the temple, having first

77
00:00:45,207 --> 00:00:47,874
 obtained mine errand from the Lord

78
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:50,515
18 For I, Jacob, and my brother Joseph had been

79
00:00:50,515 --> 00:00:53,182
 consecrated priests and teachers of this people, by

80
00:00:53,182 --> 00:00:55,849
 the hand of Nephi

81
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:56,322
19 And we did magnify our office unto the Lord,

82
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:56,822
 taking upon us the responsibility, answering the

83
00:00:56,822 --> 00:00:57,322
 sins of the people upon our own heads if we did not

84
00:00:57,322 --> 00:00:57,822
 teach them the word of God with all diligence;

85
00:00:57,822 --> 00:00:58,322
 wherefore, by laboring with our might their blood

86
00:00:58,322 --> 00:00:58,822
 might not come upon our garments; otherwise their

87
00:00:58,822 --> 00:00:59,322
 blood would come upon our garments, and we would not

88
00:00:59,322 --> 00:00:59,822
 be found spotless at the last day.
