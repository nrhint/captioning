00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:02,333
Chapter 2 Jacob denounces the love of

2
00:00:02,333 --> 00:00:04,666
riches, pride, and unchastity—Men may seek

3
00:00:04,666 --> 00:00:06,999
riches to help their fellowmen—The Lord

4
00:00:06,999 --> 00:00:09,332
commands that no man among the Nephites may

5
00:00:09,332 --> 00:00:11,665
have more than one wife—The Lord delights in

6
00:00:11,665 --> 00:00:14,982
the chastity of women. About 544–421 B.C. 

7
00:00:14,982 --> 00:00:16,649
1 The words which Jacob, the

8
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:18,316
brother of Nephi, spake unto the people

9
00:00:18,316 --> 00:00:19,92
of Nephi, after the death of Nephi:

10
00:00:19,92 --> 00:00:21,795
2 Now, my beloved brethren, I,

11
00:00:21,795 --> 00:00:23,67
Jacob, according to the

12
00:00:23,67 --> 00:00:25,545
responsibility which I am under to God,

13
00:00:25,545 --> 00:00:27,42
to magnify mine office with

14
00:00:27,42 --> 00:00:29,295
soberness, and that I might rid my

15
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:31,17
garments of your sins, I come up

16
00:00:31,17 --> 00:00:33,045
into the temple this day that I

17
00:00:33,045 --> 00:00:34,902
might declare unto you the word of God.

18
00:00:34,902 --> 00:00:36,045
3 And ye yourselves know that

19
00:00:36,045 --> 00:00:37,188
I have hitherto been diligent

20
00:00:37,188 --> 00:00:38,331
in the office of my calling;

21
00:00:38,331 --> 00:00:39,474
but I this day am weighed down

22
00:00:39,474 --> 00:00:40,617
with much more desire and

23
00:00:40,617 --> 00:00:41,76
anxiety for the welfare of your

24
00:00:41,76 --> 00:00:42,376
souls than I have hitherto been.

25
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:42,126
4 For behold, as yet, ye

26
00:00:42,126 --> 00:00:41,876
have been obedient unto

27
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:41,626
the word of the Lord,

28
00:00:41,626 --> 00:00:41,441
which I have given unto you.

29
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:41,358
5 But behold, hearken

30
00:00:41,358 --> 00:00:41,275
ye unto me, and know

31
00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:41,192
that by the help of the

32
00:00:41,192 --> 00:00:41,109
all-powerful Creator

33
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:41,026
of heaven and earth I

34
00:00:41,026 --> 00:00:40,943
can tell you

35
00:00:40,943 --> 00:00:40,86
concerning your thoughts, how

36
00:00:40,86 --> 00:00:40,777
that ye are beginning

37
00:00:40,777 --> 00:00:40,694
to labor in sin, which

38
00:00:40,694 --> 00:00:40,611
sin appeareth very

39
00:00:40,611 --> 00:00:40,528
abominable unto me, yea,

40
00:00:40,528 --> 00:00:40,974
and abominable unto God.

41
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:40,974
6 Yea, it grieveth

42
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:40,974
my soul and causeth

43
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:40,974
me to shrink with

44
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:40,974
shame before the

45
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:40,974
presence of my Maker, that

46
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:40,974
I must testify unto

47
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:40,974
you concerning the

48
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:40,507
wickedness of your hearts.

49
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:40,924
7 And also it

50
00:00:40,924 --> 00:00:41,341
grieveth me that I must

51
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:41,758
use so much

52
00:00:41,758 --> 00:00:42,175
boldness of speech

53
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:42,592
concerning you, before

54
00:00:42,592 --> 00:00:43,009
your wives and your

55
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:43,426
children, many of

56
00:00:43,426 --> 00:00:43,843
whose feelings are

57
00:00:43,843 --> 00:00:44,26
exceedingly tender and

58
00:00:44,26 --> 00:00:44,677
chaste and

59
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:45,094
delicate before God, which

60
00:00:45,094 --> 00:00:45,913
thing is pleasing unto God;

61
00:00:45,913 --> 00:00:48,199
8 And it supposeth

62
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:50,485
me that they have

63
00:00:50,485 --> 00:00:52,771
come up hither to

64
00:00:52,771 --> 00:00:55,057
hear the pleasing

65
00:00:55,057 --> 00:00:57,343
word of God, yea,

66
00:00:57,343 --> 00:00:59,629
the word which

67
00:00:59,629 --> 00:01:01,395
healeth the wounded soul.

68
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:01,355
9 Wherefore, it

69
00:01:01,355 --> 00:01:01,315
burdeneth my soul

70
00:01:01,315 --> 00:01:01,275
that I should be

71
00:01:01,275 --> 00:01:01,235
constrained,

72
00:01:01,235 --> 00:01:01,195
because of the strict

73
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:01,155
commandment

74
00:01:01,155 --> 00:01:01,115
which I have received

75
00:01:01,115 --> 00:01:01,075
from God, to

76
00:01:01,075 --> 00:01:01,035
admonish you

77
00:01:01,035 --> 00:01:00,995
according to your

78
00:01:00,995 --> 00:01:00,955
crimes, to enlarge the

79
00:01:00,955 --> 00:01:00,915
wounds of those

80
00:01:00,915 --> 00:01:00,875
who are already

81
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:00,835
wounded, instead of

82
00:01:00,835 --> 00:01:00,795
consoling and

83
00:01:00,795 --> 00:01:00,755
healing their

84
00:01:00,755 --> 00:01:00,715
wounds; and those who

85
00:01:00,715 --> 00:01:00,675
have not been

86
00:01:00,675 --> 00:01:00,635
wounded, instead of

87
00:01:00,635 --> 00:01:00,595
feasting upon the

88
00:01:00,595 --> 00:01:00,555
pleasing word of

89
00:01:00,555 --> 00:01:00,515
God have daggers

90
00:01:00,515 --> 00:01:00,475
placed to pierce

91
00:01:00,475 --> 00:01:00,435
their souls and

92
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:00,46
wound their delicate minds.

93
00:01:00,46 --> 00:01:00,872
10 But,

94
00:01:00,872 --> 00:01:01,284
notwithstanding the

95
00:01:01,284 --> 00:01:01,696
greatness of the

96
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,108
task, I must do

97
00:01:02,108 --> 00:01:02,52
according to the

98
00:01:02,52 --> 00:01:02,932
strict commands of

99
00:01:02,932 --> 00:01:03,344
God, and tell

100
00:01:03,344 --> 00:01:03,756
you concerning

101
00:01:03,756 --> 00:01:04,168
your wickedness

102
00:01:04,168 --> 00:01:04,58
and abominations,

103
00:01:04,58 --> 00:01:04,992
in the presence

104
00:01:04,992 --> 00:01:05,404
of the pure in

105
00:01:05,404 --> 00:01:05,816
heart, and the

106
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:06,228
broken heart, and

107
00:01:06,228 --> 00:01:06,64
under the glance

108
00:01:06,64 --> 00:01:07,052
of the piercing

109
00:01:07,052 --> 00:01:07,935
eye of the Almighty God.

110
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:08,435
11 Wherefore, I

111
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:08,935
must tell you

112
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:09,435
the truth

113
00:01:09,435 --> 00:01:09,935
according to the

114
00:01:09,935 --> 00:01:10,435
plainness of the

115
00:01:10,435 --> 00:01:10,935
word of God. For

116
00:01:10,935 --> 00:01:11,435
behold, as I

117
00:01:11,435 --> 00:01:11,935
inquired of the

118
00:01:11,935 --> 00:01:12,435
Lord, thus came

119
00:01:12,435 --> 00:01:12,935
the word unto

120
00:01:12,935 --> 00:01:13,435
me, saying:

121
00:01:13,435 --> 00:01:13,935
Jacob, get thou up

122
00:01:13,935 --> 00:01:14,435
into the

123
00:01:14,435 --> 00:01:14,935
temple on the

124
00:01:14,935 --> 00:01:15,435
morrow, and declare

125
00:01:15,435 --> 00:01:15,935
the word which I

126
00:01:15,935 --> 00:01:16,435
shall give

127
00:01:16,435 --> 00:01:16,91
thee unto this people.

128
00:01:16,91 --> 00:01:17,91
12 And now

129
00:01:17,91 --> 00:01:18,91
behold, my

130
00:01:18,91 --> 00:01:19,91
brethren, this is

131
00:01:19,91 --> 00:01:20,91
the word which I

132
00:01:20,91 --> 00:01:21,91
declare unto

133
00:01:21,91 --> 00:01:22,91
you, that many

134
00:01:22,91 --> 00:01:23,91
of you have

135
00:01:23,91 --> 00:01:24,91
begun to search

136
00:01:24,91 --> 00:01:25,91
for gold, and

137
00:01:25,91 --> 00:01:26,91
for silver,

138
00:01:26,91 --> 00:01:27,91
and for all

139
00:01:27,91 --> 00:01:28,91
manner of

140
00:01:28,91 --> 00:01:29,91
precious ores, in the

141
00:01:29,91 --> 00:01:30,91
which this

142
00:01:30,91 --> 00:01:31,91
land, which is a

143
00:01:31,91 --> 00:01:32,91
land of

144
00:01:32,91 --> 00:01:33,91
promise unto you

145
00:01:33,91 --> 00:01:34,91
and to your

146
00:01:34,91 --> 00:01:35,228
seed, doth abound most plentifully.

147
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:35,871
13 And the

148
00:01:35,871 --> 00:01:36,514
hand of

149
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:37,157
providence hath

150
00:01:37,157 --> 00:01:37,8
smiled upon you

151
00:01:37,8 --> 00:01:38,443
most

152
00:01:38,443 --> 00:01:39,086
pleasingly, that you

153
00:01:39,086 --> 00:01:39,729
have obtained

154
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:40,372
many riches;

155
00:01:40,372 --> 00:01:41,015
and because

156
00:01:41,015 --> 00:01:41,658
some of you

157
00:01:41,658 --> 00:01:42,301
have obtained

158
00:01:42,301 --> 00:01:42,944
more

159
00:01:42,944 --> 00:01:43,587
abundantly than that

160
00:01:43,587 --> 00:01:44,23
of your

161
00:01:44,23 --> 00:01:44,873
brethren ye are

162
00:01:44,873 --> 00:01:45,516
lifted up in the

163
00:01:45,516 --> 00:01:46,159
pride of

164
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:46,802
your hearts, and

165
00:01:46,802 --> 00:01:47,445
wear stiff

166
00:01:47,445 --> 00:01:48,088
necks and high

167
00:01:48,088 --> 00:01:48,731
heads

168
00:01:48,731 --> 00:01:49,374
because of the

169
00:01:49,374 --> 00:01:50,017
costliness of

170
00:01:50,017 --> 00:01:50,66
your apparel,

171
00:01:50,66 --> 00:01:51,303
and persecute

172
00:01:51,303 --> 00:01:51,946
your brethren

173
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:52,589
because ye

174
00:01:52,589 --> 00:01:53,08
suppose that ye are better than they.

175
00:01:53,08 --> 00:01:53,268
14 And now,

176
00:01:53,268 --> 00:01:53,456
my brethren,

177
00:01:53,456 --> 00:01:53,644
do ye

178
00:01:53,644 --> 00:01:53,832
suppose that God

179
00:01:53,832 --> 00:01:54,02
justifieth

180
00:01:54,02 --> 00:01:54,208
you in this

181
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:54,396
thing?

182
00:01:54,396 --> 00:01:54,584
Behold, I say unto

183
00:01:54,584 --> 00:01:54,772
you, Nay.

184
00:01:54,772 --> 00:01:54,96
But he

185
00:01:54,96 --> 00:01:55,148
condemneth you,

186
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:55,336
and if ye

187
00:01:55,336 --> 00:01:55,524
persist in these

188
00:01:55,524 --> 00:01:55,712
things his

189
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:55,9
judgments

190
00:01:55,9 --> 00:01:56,55
must speedily come unto you.

191
00:01:56,55 --> 00:01:57,45
15 O that

192
00:01:57,45 --> 00:01:58,35
he would

193
00:01:58,35 --> 00:01:59,25
show you that

194
00:01:59,25 --> 00:02:00,15
he can

195
00:02:00,15 --> 00:02:01,05
pierce you, and

196
00:02:01,05 --> 00:02:01,95
with one

197
00:02:01,95 --> 00:02:02,85
glance of

198
00:02:02,85 --> 00:02:03,75
his eye he

199
00:02:03,75 --> 00:02:04,65
can smite you

200
00:02:04,65 --> 00:02:05,492
to the dust!

201
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:05,433
16 O that

202
00:02:05,433 --> 00:02:05,374
he would

203
00:02:05,374 --> 00:02:05,315
rid you

204

207
00:02:05,138 --> 00:02:05,079
abomination. And, O

217
00:02:04,548 --> 00:02:04,558

00:02:06,644 --> 00:02:06,614
them

256
00:02:06,614 --> 00:02:06,584
