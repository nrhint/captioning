Chapter 2 Jacob denounces the love of riches,

2
00:00:22,5 --> 00:00:45,0
 pride, and unchastity—Men may seek riches to help

3
00:00:45,0 --> 00:01:07,5
 their fellowmen—The Lord commands that no man among

4
00:01:07,5 --> 00:01:30,0
 the Nephites may have more than one wife—The Lord

5
00:01:30,0 --> 00:01:52,5
 delights in the chastity of women. About

00:02:15,569 --> 00:03:43,236
1 The words which Jacob, the brother of Nephi,

8
00:03:43,236 --> 00:05:10,903
 spake unto the people of Nephi, after the death of

9
00:05:10,903 --> 00:06:38,57
 Nephi

10
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:44,065
2 Now, my beloved brethren, I, Jacob, according to

11
00:06:44,065 --> 00:06:49,398
 the responsibility which I am under to God, to

12
00:06:49,398 --> 00:06:54,731
 magnify mine office with soberness, and that I might

13
00:06:54,731 --> 00:07:00,064
 rid my garments of your sins, I come up into the

14
00:07:00,064 --> 00:07:05,397
 temple this day that I might declare unto you the

15
00:07:05,397 --> 00:07:10,73
 word of God

16
00:07:10,63 --> 00:07:26,63
3 And ye yourselves know that I have hitherto been

17
00:07:26,63 --> 00:07:42,63
 diligent in the office of my calling; but I this

18
00:07:42,63 --> 00:07:58,63
 day am weighed down with much more desire and

19
00:07:58,63 --> 00:08:14,63
 anxiety for the welfare of your souls than I have

20
00:08:14,63 --> 00:08:30,63
 hitherto been

21
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:46,377
4 For behold, as yet, ye have been obedient unto

22
00:08:46,377 --> 00:09:02,377
 the word of the Lord, which I have given unto you

23
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:14,275
5 But behold, hearken ye unto me, and know that by

24
00:09:14,275 --> 00:09:26,275
 the help of the all-powerful Creator of heaven

25
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:38,275
 and earth I can tell you concerning your thoughts,

26
00:09:38,275 --> 00:09:50,275
 how that ye are beginning to labor in sin, which

27
00:09:50,275 --> 00:10:02,275
 sin appeareth very abominable unto me, yea, and

28
00:10:02,275 --> 00:10:14,275
 abominable unto God

29
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:17,797
6 Yea, it grieveth my soul and causeth me to

30
00:10:17,797 --> 00:10:21,547
 shrink with shame before the presence of my Maker, that

31
00:10:21,547 --> 00:10:25,297
 I must testify unto you concerning the wickedness

32
00:10:25,297 --> 00:10:29,047
 of your hearts

33
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:55,596
7 And also it grieveth me that I must use so much

34
00:10:55,596 --> 00:11:21,196
 boldness of speech concerning you, before your

35
00:11:21,196 --> 00:11:46,796
 wives and your children, many of whose feelings are

36
00:11:46,796 --> 00:12:12,396
 exceedingly tender and chaste and delicate before

37
00:12:12,396 --> 00:12:37,996
 God, which thing is pleasing unto God

38
00:12:37,59 --> 00:14:02,59
8 And it supposeth me that they have come up

39
00:14:02,59 --> 00:15:27,59
 hither to hear the pleasing word of God, yea, the word

40
00:15:27,59 --> 00:16:52,59
 which healeth the wounded soul

41
00:02:15,569 --> 00:03:03,736
11 Wherefore, I must tell you the truth according

42
00:03:03,736 --> 00:03:51,903
 to the plainness of the word of God. For behold,

43
00:03:51,903 --> 00:04:40,07
 as I inquired of the Lord, thus came the word unto

44
00:04:40,07 --> 00:05:28,237
 me, saying: Jacob, get thou up into the temple on

45
00:05:28,237 --> 00:06:16,404
 the morrow, and declare the word which I shall

46
00:06:16,404 --> 00:07:04,571
 give thee unto this people

47
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:10,724
12 And now behold, my brethren, this is the word

48
00:07:10,724 --> 00:07:17,057
 which I declare unto you, that many of you have

49
00:07:17,057 --> 00:07:23,39
 begun to search for gold, and for silver, and for all

50
00:07:23,39 --> 00:07:29,723
 manner of precious ores, in the which this land,

51
00:07:29,723 --> 00:07:36,056
 which is a land of promise unto you and to your

52
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:42,389
 seed, doth abound most plentifully

53
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:49,687
13 And the hand of providence hath smiled upon you

54
00:07:49,687 --> 00:07:57,312
 most pleasingly, that you have obtained many

55
00:07:57,312 --> 00:08:04,937
 riches; and because some of you have obtained more

56
00:08:04,937 --> 00:08:12,562
 abundantly than that of your brethren ye are lifted

57
00:08:12,562 --> 00:08:20,187
 up in the pride of your hearts, and wear stiff

58
00:08:20,187 --> 00:08:27,812
 necks and high heads because of the costliness of your

59
00:08:27,812 --> 00:08:35,437
 apparel, and persecute your brethren because ye

60
00:08:35,437 --> 00:08:43,062
 suppose that ye are better than they

61
00:08:43,189 --> 00:09:13,389
14 And now, my brethren, do ye suppose that God

62
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:43,589
 justifieth you in this thing? Behold, I say unto

63
00:09:43,589 --> 00:10:13,789
 you, Nay. But he condemneth you, and if ye persist in

64
00:10:13,789 --> 00:10:43,989
 these things his judgments must speedily come

65
00:10:43,989 --> 00:11:14,189
 unto you

66
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:46,707
15 O that he would show you that he can pierce

67
00:11:46,707 --> 00:12:18,707
 you, and with one glance of his eye he can smite you

68
00:12:18,707 --> 00:12:50,707
 to the dust

69
00:12:50,403 --> 00:13:02,403
16 O that he would rid you from this iniquity and

70
00:13:02,403 --> 00:13:14,403
 abomination. And, O that ye would listen unto the

71
00:13:14,403 --> 00:13:26,403
 word of his commands, and let not this pride of

72
00:13:26,403 --> 00:13:38,403
 your hearts destroy your souls

73
00:13:38,251 --> 00:14:52,584
17 Think of your brethren like unto yourselves,

74
00:14:52,584 --> 00:16:06,917
 and be familiar with all and free with your

75
00:16:06,917 --> 00:17:21,25
 substance, that they may be rich like unto you

76
00:02:15,569 --> 00:03:08,169
20 And now, my brethren, I have spoken unto you

77
00:03:08,169 --> 00:04:00,769
 concerning pride; and those of you which have

78
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:53,369
 afflicted your neighbor, and persecuted him because ye

79
00:04:53,369 --> 00:05:45,969
 were proud in your hearts, of the things which God

80
00:05:45,969 --> 00:06:38,569
 hath given you, what say ye of it

81
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:44,065
21 Do ye not suppose that such things are

82
00:06:44,065 --> 00:06:49,398
 abominable unto him who created all flesh? And the one

83
00:06:49,398 --> 00:06:54,731
 being is as precious in his sight as the other. And

84
00:06:54,731 --> 00:07:00,064
 all flesh is of the dust; and for the selfsame end

85
00:07:00,064 --> 00:07:05,397
 hath he created them, that they should keep his

86
00:07:05,397 --> 00:07:10,73
 commandments and glorify him forever

87
00:07:10,63 --> 00:07:30,63
22 And now I make an end of speaking unto you

88
00:07:30,63 --> 00:07:50,63
 concerning this pride. And were it not that I must

89
00:07:50,63 --> 00:08:10,63
 speak unto you concerning a grosser crime, my heart

90
00:08:10,63 --> 00:08:30,63
 would rejoice exceedingly because of you

91
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:34,948
23 But the word of God burdens me because of your

92
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:39,519
 grosser crimes. For behold, thus saith the Lord:

93
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,09
 This people begin to wax in iniquity; they

94
00:08:44,09 --> 00:08:48,661
 understand not the scriptures, for they seek to excuse

95
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:53,232
 themselves in committing whoredoms, because of the

96
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:57,803
 things which were written concerning David, and

97
00:08:57,803 --> 00:09:02,374
 Solomon his son

98
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:26,275
24 Behold, David and Solomon truly had many wives

99
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:50,275
 and concubines, which thing was abominable before

100
00:09:50,275 --> 00:10:14,275
 me, saith the Lord

101
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:17,047
25 Wherefore, thus saith the Lord, I have led this

102
00:10:17,047 --> 00:10:20,047
 people forth out of the land of Jerusalem, by the

103
00:10:20,047 --> 00:10:23,047
 power of mine arm, that I might raise up unto me

104
00:10:23,047 --> 00:10:26,047
 a righteous branch from the fruit of the loins of

105
00:10:26,047 --> 00:10:29,047
 Joseph

106
00:10:29,996 --> 00:11:33,996
26 Wherefore, I the Lord God will not suffer that

107
00:11:33,996 --> 00:12:37,996
 this people shall do like unto them of old

108
00:12:37,59 --> 00:13:41,34
27 Wherefore, my brethren, hear me, and hearken to

109
00:13:41,34 --> 00:14:45,09
 the word of the Lord: For there shall not any man

110
00:14:45,09 --> 00:15:48,84
 among you have save it be one wife; and

111
00:15:48,84 --> 00:16:52,59
 concubines he shall have none

112
00:02:15,569 --> 00:03:43,236
30 For if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise

113
00:03:43,236 --> 00:05:10,903
 up seed unto me, I will command my people;

114
00:05:10,903 --> 00:06:38,57
 otherwise they shall hearken unto these things

115
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:45,132
31 For behold, I, the Lord, have seen the sorrow,

116
00:06:45,132 --> 00:06:51,532
 and heard the mourning of the daughters of my

117
00:06:51,532 --> 00:06:57,932
 people in the land of Jerusalem, yea, and in all the

118
00:06:57,932 --> 00:07:04,332
 lands of my people, because of the wickedness and

119
00:07:04,332 --> 00:07:10,732
 abominations of their husbands

120
00:07:10,63 --> 00:07:26,63
32 And I will not suffer, saith the Lord of Hosts,

121
00:07:26,63 --> 00:07:42,63
 that the cries of the fair daughters of this

122
00:07:42,63 --> 00:07:58,63
 people, which I have led out of the land of Jerusalem,

123
00:07:58,63 --> 00:08:14,63
 shall come up unto me against the men of my

124
00:08:14,63 --> 00:08:30,63
 people, saith the Lord of Hosts

125
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:36,777
33 For they shall not lead away captive the

126
00:08:36,777 --> 00:08:43,177
 daughters of my people because of their tenderness, save

127
00:08:43,177 --> 00:08:49,577
 I shall visit them with a sore curse, even unto

128
00:08:49,577 --> 00:08:55,977
 destruction; for they shall not commit whoredoms,

129
00:08:55,977 --> 00:09:02,377
 like unto them of old, saith the Lord of Hosts

130
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:16,675
34 And now behold, my brethren, ye know that these

131
00:09:16,675 --> 00:09:31,075
 commandments were given to our father, Lehi;

132
00:09:31,075 --> 00:09:45,475
 wherefore, ye have known them before; and ye have come

133
00:09:45,475 --> 00:09:59,875
 unto great condemnation; for ye have done these

134
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:14,275
 things which ye ought not to have done

135
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:14,047
35 Behold, ye have done greater iniquities than

136
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:14,047
 the Lamanites, our brethren. Ye have broken the

137
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:14,047
 hearts of your tender wives, and lost the confidence

138
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:14,047
 of your children, because of your bad examples

139
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:14,047
 before them; and the sobbings of their hearts ascend

140
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:14,047
 up to God against you. And because of the

141
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:14,047
 strictness of the word of God, which cometh down against

142
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:14,047
 you, many hearts died, pierced with deep wounds.
