00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Chapter 2 Jacob denounces the love of

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
riches, pride, and unchastity—Men may seek

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
riches to help their fellowmen—The Lord

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
commands that no man among the Nephites may

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
have more than one wife—The Lord delights in

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:16:26,
the chastity of women. About 544–421 B.C. 

7
00:16:26,0 --> 00:16:26,0
1 The words which Jacob, the

8
00:16:26,0 --> 00:16:26,0
brother of Nephi, spake unto the people

9
00:16:26,0 --> 00:17:10,
of Nephi, after the death of Nephi:

10
00:17:10,0 --> 00:17:10,0
2 Now, my beloved brethren, I,

11
00:17:10,0 --> 00:17:10,0
Jacob, according to the

12
00:17:10,0 --> 00:17:10,0
responsibility which I am under to God,

13
00:17:10,0 --> 00:17:10,0
to magnify mine office with

14
00:17:10,0 --> 00:17:10,0
soberness, and that I might rid my

15
00:17:10,0 --> 00:17:10,0
garments of your sins, I come up

16
00:17:10,0 --> 00:17:10,0
into the temple this day that I

17
00:17:10,0 --> 00:21:39,
might declare unto you the word of God.

18
00:21:39,0 --> 00:21:39,0
3 And ye yourselves know that

19
00:21:39,0 --> 00:21:39,0
I have hitherto been diligent

20
00:21:39,0 --> 00:21:39,0
in the office of my calling;

21
00:21:39,0 --> 00:21:39,0
but I this day am weighed down

22
00:21:39,0 --> 00:21:39,0
with much more desire and

23
00:21:39,0 --> 00:21:39,0
anxiety for the welfare of your

24
00:21:39,0 --> 00:21:11,
souls than I have hitherto been.

25
00:21:11,0 --> 00:21:11,0
4 For behold, as yet, ye

26
00:21:11,0 --> 00:21:11,0
have been obedient unto

27
00:21:11,0 --> 00:21:11,0
the word of the Lord,

28
00:21:11,0 --> 00:20:43,
which I have given unto you.

29
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
5 But behold, hearken

30
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
ye unto me, and know

31
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
that by the help of the

32
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
all-powerful Creator

33
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
of heaven and earth I

34
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
can tell you

35
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
concerning your thoughts, how

36
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
that ye are beginning

37
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
to labor in sin, which

38
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
sin appeareth very

39
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
abominable unto me, yea,

40
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:57,
and abominable unto God.

41
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
6 Yea, it grieveth

42
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
my soul and causeth

43
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
me to shrink with

44
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
shame before the

45
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
presence of my Maker, that

46
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
I must testify unto

47
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
you concerning the

48
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:43,
wickedness of your hearts.

49
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
7 And also it

50
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
grieveth me that I must

51
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
use so much

52
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
boldness of speech

53
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
concerning you, before

54
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
your wives and your

55
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
children, many of

56
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
whose feelings are

57
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
exceedingly tender and

58
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
chaste and

59
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
delicate before God, which

60
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:57,
thing is pleasing unto God;

61
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
8 And it supposeth

62
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
me that they have

63
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
come up hither to

64
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
hear the pleasing

65
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
word of God, yea,

66
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
the word which

67
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:43,
healeth the wounded soul.

68
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
9 Wherefore, it

69
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
burdeneth my soul

70
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
that I should be

71
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
constrained,

72
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
because of the strict

73
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
commandment

74
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
which I have received

75
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
from God, to

76
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
admonish you

77
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
according to your

78
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
crimes, to enlarge the

79
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
wounds of those

80
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
who are already

81
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
wounded, instead of

82
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
consoling and

83
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
healing their

84
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
wounds; and those who

85
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
have not been

86
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
wounded, instead of

87
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
feasting upon the

88
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
pleasing word of

89
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
God have daggers

90
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
placed to pierce

91
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
their souls and

92
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:57,
wound their delicate minds.

93
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
10 But,

94
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
notwithstanding the

95
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
greatness of the

96
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
task, I must do

97
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
according to the

98
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
strict commands of

99
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
God, and tell

100
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
you concerning

101
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
your wickedness

102
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
and abominations,

103
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
in the presence

104
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
of the pure in

105
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
heart, and the

106
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
broken heart, and

107
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
under the glance

108
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
of the piercing

109
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:43,
eye of the Almighty God.

110
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
11 Wherefore, I

111
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
must tell you

112
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
the truth

113
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
according to the

114
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
plainness of the

115
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
word of God. For

116
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
behold, as I

117
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
inquired of the

118
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
Lord, thus came

119
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
the word unto

120
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
me, saying:

121
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
Jacob, get thou up

122
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
into the

123
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
temple on the

124
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
morrow, and declare

125
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
the word which I

126
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
shall give

127
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:57,
thee unto this people.

128
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
12 And now

129
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
behold, my

130
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
brethren, this is

131
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
the word which I

132
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
declare unto

133
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
you, that many

134
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
of you have

135
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
begun to search

136
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
for gold, and

137
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
for silver,

138
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
and for all

139
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
manner of

140
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
precious ores, in the

141
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
which this

142
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
land, which is a

143
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
land of

144
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
promise unto you

145
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
and to your

146
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:43,
seed, doth abound most plentifully.

147
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
13 And the

148
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
hand of

149
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
providence hath

150
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
smiled upon you

151
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
most

152
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
pleasingly, that you

153
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
have obtained

154
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
many riches;

155
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
and because

156
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
some of you

157
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
have obtained

158
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
more

159
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
abundantly than that

160
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
of your

161
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
brethren ye are

162
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
lifted up in the

163
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
pride of

164
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
your hearts, and

165
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
wear stiff

166
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
necks and high

167
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
heads

168
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
because of the

169
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
costliness of

170
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
your apparel,

171
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
and persecute

172
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
your brethren

173
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
because ye

174
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:57,
suppose that ye are better than they.

175
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
14 And now,

176
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
my brethren,

177
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
do ye

178
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
suppose that God

179
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
justifieth

180
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
you in this

181
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
thing?

182
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
Behold, I say unto

183
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
you, Nay.

184
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
But he

185
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
condemneth you,

186
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
and if ye

187
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
persist in these

188
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
things his

189
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
judgments

190
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:43,
must speedily come unto you.

191
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
15 O that

192
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
he would

193
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
show you that

194
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
he can

195
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
pierce you, and

196
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
with one

197
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
glance of

198
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
his eye he

199
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
can smite you

200
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:57,
to the dust!

201
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
16 O that

202
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
he would

203
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
rid you

204
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
from this

205
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
iniquity and

206
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0


207
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
abomination. And, O

208
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
that ye

209
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
would listen

210
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
unto the

211
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
word of

212
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
his

213
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
commands, and let

214
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
not this

215
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
pride of

216
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:57,0
your hearts

217
00:20:57,0 --> 00:20:43,
destroy your souls!

218
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
17 Think

219
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
of your

220
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
brethren

221
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
like unto

222
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0


223
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
yourselves, and be

224
00:20:43,0 --> 00:20:43,0
