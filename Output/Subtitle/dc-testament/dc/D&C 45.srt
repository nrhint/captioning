00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 45 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Prophet to the Church, at Kirtland, Ohio,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
March 7, 1831. Prefacing the record of this

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
revelation, Joseph Smith’s history states that “at

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
this age of the Church … many false reports … and

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
foolish stories, were published … and

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
circulated, … to prevent people from investigating the

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
work, or embracing the faith. … But to the joy of

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Saints, … I received the following.” 
1–5,

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Christ is our advocate with the Father; 
6–10, The

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
gospel is a messenger to prepare the way before

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Lord; 
11–15, Enoch and his brethren were

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
received by the Lord unto Himself; 
16–23, Christ

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
revealed signs of His coming as given on the

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Mount of Olives; 
24–38, The gospel will be

16
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
restored, the times of the Gentiles will be fulfilled,

17
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and a desolating sickness will cover the land;

18
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
39–47, Signs, wonders, and the Resurrection are

19
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
to attend the Second Coming; 
48–53, Christ

20
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
will stand on the Mount of Olives, and the Jews

21
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
will see the wounds in His hands and feet; 
54–59,

22
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
The Lord will reign during the Millennium;

23
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
60–62, The Prophet is instructed to begin the

24
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
translation of the New Testament, through which

25
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
important information will be made known; 
63–75, The

26
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Saints are commanded to gather and build the New

27
00:00:00,0 --> 03:23:42,
Jerusalem, to which people from all nations will come. 

28
03:23:42,0 --> 03:23:42,0
1 Hearken, O ye people of my church, to

29
03:23:42,0 --> 03:23:42,0
whom the kingdom has been given; hearken ye

30
03:23:42,0 --> 03:23:42,0
and give ear to him who laid the foundation

31
03:23:42,0 --> 03:23:42,0
of the earth, who made the heavens and all

32
03:23:42,0 --> 03:23:42,0
the hosts thereof, and by whom all things

33
03:23:42,0 --> 03:56:42,
were made which live, and move, and have a being.

34
03:56:42,0 --> 03:56:42,0
2 And again I say, hearken unto my

35
03:56:42,0 --> 03:56:42,0
voice, lest death shall overtake

36
03:56:42,0 --> 03:56:42,0
you; in an hour when ye think not the

37
03:56:42,0 --> 03:56:42,0
summer shall be past, and the

38
03:56:42,0 --> 03:58:46,
harvest ended, and your souls not saved.

39
03:58:46,0 --> 03:58:46,0
3 Listen to him who is the

40
03:58:46,0 --> 03:58:46,0
advocate with the Father, who is

41
03:58:46,0 --> 04:25:44,
pleading your cause before him—

42
04:25:44,0 --> 04:25:44,0
4 Saying: Father, behold

43
04:25:44,0 --> 04:25:44,0
the sufferings and death of

44
04:25:44,0 --> 04:25:44,0
him who did no sin, in

45
04:25:44,0 --> 04:25:44,0
whom thou wast well pleased;

46
04:25:44,0 --> 04:25:44,0
behold the blood of thy

47
04:25:44,0 --> 04:25:44,0
Son which was shed, the

48
04:25:44,0 --> 04:25:44,0
blood of him whom thou gavest

49
04:25:44,0 --> 04:26:48,
that thyself might be glorified;

50
04:26:48,0 --> 04:26:48,0
5 Wherefore, Father,

51
04:26:48,0 --> 04:26:48,0
spare these my brethren

52
04:26:48,0 --> 04:26:48,0
that believe on my name,

53
04:26:48,0 --> 04:26:48,0
that they may come unto me

54
04:26:48,0 --> 04:26:54,
and have everlasting life.

55
04:26:54,0 --> 04:26:54,0
6 Hearken, O ye people

56
04:26:54,0 --> 04:26:54,0
of my church, and ye

57
04:26:54,0 --> 04:26:54,0
elders listen together,

58
04:26:54,0 --> 04:26:54,0
and hear my voice while

59
04:26:54,0 --> 04:26:54,0
it is called today, and

60
04:26:54,0 --> 04:26:32,
harden not your hearts;

61
04:26:32,0 --> 04:26:32,0
7 For verily I say

62
04:26:32,0 --> 04:26:32,0
unto you that I am

63
04:26:32,0 --> 04:26:32,0
Alpha and Omega, the

64
04:26:32,0 --> 04:26:32,0
beginning and the end,

65
04:26:32,0 --> 04:26:32,0
the light and the life

66
04:26:32,0 --> 04:26:32,0
of the world—a light

67
04:26:32,0 --> 04:26:32,0
that shineth in

68
04:26:32,0 --> 04:26:32,0
darkness and the darkness

69
04:26:32,0 --> 04:25:36,
comprehendeth it not.

70
04:25:36,0 --> 04:25:36,0
8 I came unto mine

71
04:25:36,0 --> 04:25:36,0
own, and mine own

72
04:25:36,0 --> 04:25:36,0
received me not; but unto

73
04:25:36,0 --> 04:25:36,0
as many as received

74
04:25:36,0 --> 04:25:36,0
me gave I power to do

75
04:25:36,0 --> 04:25:36,0
many miracles, and to

76
04:25:36,0 --> 04:25:36,0
become the sons of

77
04:25:36,0 --> 04:25:36,0
God; and even unto

78
04:25:36,0 --> 04:25:36,0
them that believed on my

79
04:25:36,0 --> 04:25:36,0
name gave I power to

80
04:25:36,0 --> 04:27:40,
obtain eternal life.

81
04:27:40,0 --> 04:27:40,0
9 And even so I

82
04:27:40,0 --> 04:27:40,0
have sent mine

83
04:27:40,0 --> 04:27:40,0
everlasting covenant into

84
04:27:40,0 --> 04:27:40,0
the world, to be a

85
04:27:40,0 --> 04:27:40,0
light to the world,

86
04:27:40,0 --> 04:27:40,0
and to be a

87
04:27:40,0 --> 04:27:40,0
standard for my people,

88
04:27:40,0 --> 04:27:40,0
and for the Gentiles

89
04:27:40,0 --> 04:27:40,0
to seek to it, and

90
04:27:40,0 --> 04:27:40,0
to be a messenger

91
04:27:40,0 --> 04:27:40,0
before my face to

92
04:27:40,0 --> 04:41:44,
prepare the way before me.

93
04:41:44,0 --> 04:41:44,0
10 Wherefore,

94
04:41:44,0 --> 04:41:44,0
come ye unto it, and

95
04:41:44,0 --> 04:41:44,0
with him that

96
04:41:44,0 --> 04:41:44,0
cometh I will

97
04:41:44,0 --> 04:41:44,0
reason as with men in

98
04:41:44,0 --> 04:41:44,0
days of old, and

99
04:41:44,0 --> 04:41:44,0
I will show unto

100
04:41:44,0 --> 04:50:46,
you my strong reasoning.

101
04:50:46,0 --> 04:50:46,0
11 Wherefore,

102
04:50:46,0 --> 04:50:46,0
hearken ye

103
04:50:46,0 --> 04:50:46,0
together and let me

104
04:50:46,0 --> 04:50:46,0
show unto you

105
04:50:46,0 --> 04:50:46,0
even my

106
04:50:46,0 --> 04:50:46,0
wisdom—the wisdom of

107
04:50:46,0 --> 04:50:46,0
him whom ye say

108
04:50:46,0 --> 04:50:46,0
is the God of

109
04:50:46,0 --> 04:53:48,
Enoch, and his brethren,

110
04:53:48,0 --> 04:53:48,0
12 Who were

111
04:53:48,0 --> 04:53:48,0
separated from

112
04:53:48,0 --> 04:53:48,0
the earth, and

113
04:53:48,0 --> 04:53:48,0
were received

114
04:53:48,0 --> 04:53:48,0
unto myself—a

115
04:53:48,0 --> 04:53:48,0
city reserved

116
04:53:48,0 --> 04:53:48,0
until a day of

117
04:53:48,0 --> 04:53:48,0
righteousness

118
04:53:48,0 --> 04:53:48,0
shall come—a

119
04:53:48,0 --> 04:53:48,0
day which was

120
04:53:48,0 --> 04:53:48,0
sought for by

121
04:53:48,0 --> 04:53:48,0
all holy men,

122
04:53:48,0 --> 04:53:48,0
and they found

123
04:53:48,0 --> 04:53:48,0
it not

124
04:53:48,0 --> 04:53:48,0
because of

125
04:53:48,0 --> 05:01:52,
wickedness and abominations;

126
05:01:52,0 --> 05:01:52,0
13 And

127
05:01:52,0 --> 05:01:52,0
confessed they

128
05:01:52,0 --> 05:01:52,0
were strangers

129
05:01:52,0 --> 05:01:52,0
and

130
05:01:52,0 --> 05:13:30,
pilgrims on the earth;

131
05:13:30,0 --> 05:13:30,0
14 But

132
05:13:30,0 --> 05:13:30,0
obtained a

133
05:13:30,0 --> 05:13:30,0
promise that

134
05:13:30,0 --> 05:13:30,0
they should

135
05:13:30,0 --> 05:13:30,0
find it and

136
05:13:30,0 --> 05:13:30,0
see it in

137
05:13:30,0 --> 05:32:02,
their flesh.

138
05:32:02,0 --> 05:32:02,0
15

139
05:32:02,0 --> 05:32:02,0
Wherefore,

140
05:32:02,0 --> 05:32:02,0
hearken and I

141
05:32:02,0 --> 05:32:02,0
will reason

142
05:32:02,0 --> 05:32:02,0
with you,

143
05:32:02,0 --> 05:32:02,0
and I will

144
05:32:02,0 --> 05:32:02,0
speak

145
05:32:02,0 --> 05:32:02,0
unto you and

146
05:32:02,0 --> 05:32:02,0
prophesy,

147
05:32:02,0 --> 05:32:02,0
as unto

148
05:32:02,0 --> 05:46:36,
men in days of old.

149
05:46:36,0 --> 05:46:36,0
16 And I

150
05:46:36,0 --> 05:46:36,0
will show

151
05:46:36,0 --> 05:46:36,0
it

152
05:46:36,0 --> 05:46:36,0
plainly as I

153
05:46:36,0 --> 05:46:36,0
showed it

154
05:46:36,0 --> 05:46:36,0
unto my

155
05:46:36,0 --> 05:46:36,0
disciples

156
05:46:36,0 --> 05:46:36,0
as I

157
05:46:36,0 --> 05:46:36,0
stood before

158
05:46:36,0 --> 05:46:36,0
them in

159
05:46:36,0 --> 05:46:36,0
the flesh,

160
05:46:36,0 --> 05:46:36,0
and

161
05:46:36,0 --> 05:46:36,0
spake unto

162
05:46:36,0 --> 05:46:36,0
them,

163
05:46:36,0 --> 05:46:36,0
saying: As ye

164
05:46:36,0 --> 05:46:36,0
have

165
05:46:36,0 --> 05:46:36,0
asked of me

166
05:46:36,0 --> 05:46:36,0
concerning

167
05:46:36,0 --> 05:46:36,0
the

168
05:46:36,0 --> 05:46:36,0
signs of my

169
05:46:36,0 --> 05:46:36,0
coming, in

170
05:46:36,0 --> 05:46:36,0
the day

171
05:46:36,0 --> 05:46:36,0
when I

172
05:46:36,0 --> 05:46:36,0
shall come

173
05:46:36,0 --> 05:46:36,0
in my

174
05:46:36,0 --> 05:46:36,0
glory in the

175
05:46:36,0 --> 05:46:36,0
clouds

176
05:46:36,0 --> 05:46:36,0
of heaven,

177
05:46:36,0 --> 05:46:36,0
to

178
05:46:36,0 --> 05:46:36,0
fulfil the

179
05:46:36,0 --> 05:46:36,0
promises

180
05:46:36,0 --> 05:50:43,
that I have made unto your fathers,

181
05:50:43,0 --> 05:50:43,0
17 For

182
05:50:43,0 --> 05:50:43,0
as ye

183
05:50:43,0 --> 05:50:43,0
have looked

184
05:50:43,0 --> 05:50:43,0
upon

185
05:50:43,0 --> 05:50:43,0
the long

186
05:50:43,0 --> 05:50:43,0
absence

187
05:50:43,0 --> 05:50:43,0
of your

188
05:50:43,0 --> 05:50:43,0
spirits

189
05:50:43,0 --> 05:50:43,0
from your

190
05:50:43,0 --> 05:50:43,0
bodies

191
05:50:43,0 --> 05:50:43,0
to be a

192
05:50:43,0 --> 05:50:43,0
bondage,

193
05:50:43,0 --> 05:50:43,0
I will

194
05:50:43,0 --> 05:50:43,0
show

195
05:50:43,0 --> 05:50:43,0
unto you

196
05:50:43,0 --> 05:50:43,0
how the

197
05:50:43,0 --> 05:50:43,0
day of

198
05:50:43,0 --> 05:50:43,0
redemption

199
05:50:43,0 --> 05:50:43,0
shall

200
05:50:43,0 --> 05:50:43,0
come, and

201
05:50:43,0 --> 05:50:43,0
also the

202
05:50:43,0 --> 05:50:43,0


203
05:50:43,0 --> 06:08:44,
restoration of the scattered Israel.

204
06:08:44,0 --> 06:08:44,0
18 And

205
06:08:44,0 --> 06:08:44,0
now ye

206
06:08:44,0 --> 06:08:44,0
behold

207
06:08:44,0 --> 06:08:44,0
this

208
06:08:44,0 --> 06:08:44,0
temple

209
06:08:44,0 --> 06:08:44,0
which is

210
06:08:44,0 --> 06:08:44,0
in

211
06:08:44,0 --> 06:08:44,0
Jerusalem,

212
06:08:44,0 --> 06:08:44,0
which

213
06:08:44,0 --> 06:08:44,0
ye call

214
06:08:44,0 --> 06:08:44,0
the

215
06:08:44,0 --> 06:08:44,0
house of

216
06:08:44,0 --> 06:08:44,0
God, and

217
06:08:44,0 --> 06:08:44,0
your

218
06:08:44,0 --> 06:08:44,0
enemies

219
06:08:44,0 --> 06:08:44,0
