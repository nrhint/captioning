1
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:18,426
Section 45 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:18,426 --> 00:00:25,574
 the Prophet to the Church, at Kirtland, Ohio, March

3
00:00:25,574 --> 00:00:32,722
 7, 1831. Prefacing the record of this revelation,

4
00:00:32,722 --> 00:00:39,87
 Joseph Smith’s history states that “at this age

5
00:00:39,87 --> 00:00:47,018
 of the Church … many false reports … and foolish

6
00:00:47,018 --> 00:00:54,166
 stories, were published … and circulated, … to

7
00:00:54,166 --> 00:01:01,314
 prevent people from investigating the work, or

8
00:01:01,314 --> 00:01:08,462
 embracing the faith. … But to the joy of the Saints, … I

9
00:01:08,462 --> 00:01:15,61
 received the following.” 
1–5, Christ is our

10
00:01:15,61 --> 00:01:22,758
 advocate with the Father; 
6–10, The gospel is a

11
00:01:22,758 --> 00:01:29,906
 messenger to prepare the way before the Lord; 
11–15,

12
00:01:29,906 --> 00:01:37,054
 Enoch and his brethren were received by the Lord unto

13
00:01:37,054 --> 00:01:44,202
 Himself; 
16–23, Christ revealed signs of His

14
00:01:44,202 --> 00:01:51,35
 coming as given on the Mount of Olives; 
24–38, The

15
00:01:51,35 --> 00:01:58,498
 gospel will be restored, the times of the Gentiles

16
00:01:58,498 --> 00:02:05,646
 will be fulfilled, and a desolating sickness will

17
00:02:05,646 --> 00:02:12,794
 cover the land; 
39–47, Signs, wonders, and the

18
00:02:12,794 --> 00:02:19,942
 Resurrection are to attend the Second Coming;

19
00:02:19,942 --> 00:02:27,09
48–53, Christ will stand on the Mount of Olives, and

20
00:02:27,09 --> 00:02:34,238
 the Jews will see the wounds in His hands and feet;

21
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:41,386
54–59, The Lord will reign during the Millennium;

22
00:02:41,386 --> 00:02:48,534
60–62, The Prophet is instructed to begin the

23
00:02:48,534 --> 00:02:55,682
 translation of the New Testament, through which

24
00:02:55,682 --> 00:03:02,83
 important information will be made known; 
63–75, The

25
00:03:02,83 --> 00:03:09,978
 Saints are commanded to gather and build the New

26
00:03:09,978 --> 00:03:17,126
 Jerusalem, to which people from all nations will

27
00:03:17,126 --> 00:03:24,274
 come.

28
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:30,204
1 Hearken, O ye people of my church, to whom the

29
00:03:30,204 --> 00:03:36,037
 kingdom has been given; hearken ye and give ear to

30
00:03:36,037 --> 00:03:41,87
 him who laid the foundation of the earth, who made

31
00:03:41,87 --> 00:03:47,703
 the heavens and all the hosts thereof, and by

32
00:03:47,703 --> 00:03:53,536
 whom all things were made which live, and move, and

33
00:03:53,536 --> 00:03:59,369
 have a being

34
00:03:59,856 --> 00:04:07,606
2 And again I say, hearken unto my voice, lest

35
00:04:07,606 --> 00:04:15,356
 death shall overtake you; in an hour when ye think

36
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:23,106
 not the summer shall be past, and the harvest ended,

37
00:04:23,106 --> 00:04:30,856
 and your souls not saved

38
00:04:30,12 --> 00:04:36,12
3 Listen to him who is the advocate with the

39
00:04:36,12 --> 00:04:42,12
 Father, who is pleading your cause before him

40
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:49,099
4 Saying: Father, behold the sufferings and death

41
00:04:49,099 --> 00:04:55,499
 of him who did no sin, in whom thou wast well

42
00:04:55,499 --> 00:05:01,899
 pleased; behold the blood of thy Son which was shed,

43
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:08,299
 the blood of him whom thou gavest that thyself

44
00:05:08,299 --> 00:05:14,699
 might be glorified

45
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:20,181
5 Wherefore, Father, spare these my brethren that

46
00:05:20,181 --> 00:05:26,181
 believe on my name, that they may come unto me and

47
00:05:26,181 --> 00:05:32,181
 have everlasting life

48
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:39,332
6 Hearken, O ye people of my church, and ye elders

49
00:05:39,332 --> 00:05:45,665
 listen together, and hear my voice while it is

50
00:05:45,665 --> 00:05:51,998
 called today, and harden not your hearts

51
00:05:51,535 --> 00:05:57,285
7 For verily I say unto you that I am Alpha and

52
00:05:57,285 --> 00:06:03,035
 Omega, the beginning and the end, the light and the

53
00:06:03,035 --> 00:06:08,785
 life of the world—a light that shineth in darkness

54
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:14,535
 and the darkness comprehendeth it not

55
00:06:14,04 --> 00:06:21,04
8 I came unto mine own, and mine own received me

56
00:06:21,04 --> 00:06:28,04
 not; but unto as many as received me gave I power

57
00:06:28,04 --> 00:06:35,04
 to do many miracles, and to become the sons of God;

58
00:06:35,04 --> 00:06:42,04
 and even unto them that believed on my name gave

59
00:06:42,04 --> 00:06:49,04
 I power to obtain eternal life

60
00:06:49,059 --> 00:06:56,059
9 And even so I have sent mine everlasting

61
00:06:56,059 --> 00:07:03,059
 covenant into the world, to be a light to the world, and

62
00:07:03,059 --> 00:07:10,059
 to be a standard for my people, and for the

63
00:07:10,059 --> 00:07:17,059
 Gentiles to seek to it, and to be a messenger before my

64
00:07:17,059 --> 00:07:24,059
 face to prepare the way before me

65
00:07:24,327 --> 00:07:31,327
10 Wherefore, come ye unto it, and with him that

66
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:38,327
 cometh I will reason as with men in days of old,

67
00:07:38,327 --> 00:07:45,327
 and I will show unto you my strong reasoning

68
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:52,665
11 Wherefore, hearken ye together and let me show

69
00:07:52,665 --> 00:07:59,998
 unto you even my wisdom—the wisdom of him whom ye

70
00:07:59,998 --> 00:08:07,331
 say is the God of Enoch, and his brethren

71
00:08:07,837 --> 00:08:13,637
12 Who were separated from the earth, and were

72
00:08:13,637 --> 00:08:19,437
 received unto myself—a city reserved until a day of

73
00:08:19,437 --> 00:08:25,237
 righteousness shall come—a day which was sought for

74
00:08:25,237 --> 00:08:31,037
 by all holy men, and they found it not because of

75
00:08:31,037 --> 00:08:36,837
 wickedness and abominations

76
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:40,916
13 And confessed they were strangers and pilgrims

77
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:44,916
 on the earth

78
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:50,424
14 But obtained a promise that they should find it

79
00:08:50,424 --> 00:08:56,424
 and see it in their flesh

80
00:08:56,419 --> 00:09:02,752
15 Wherefore, hearken and I will reason with you,

81
00:09:02,752 --> 00:09:09,085
 and I will speak unto you and prophesy, as unto

82
00:09:09,085 --> 00:09:15,418
 men in days of old

83
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:20,974
16 And I will show it plainly as I showed it unto

84
00:09:20,974 --> 00:09:26,26
 my disciples as I stood before them in the flesh,

85
00:09:26,26 --> 00:09:31,546
 and spake unto them, saying: As ye have asked of

86
00:09:31,546 --> 00:09:36,832
 me concerning the signs of my coming, in the day

87
00:09:36,832 --> 00:09:42,118
 when I shall come in my glory in the clouds of

88
00:09:42,118 --> 00:09:47,404
 heaven, to fulfil the promises that I have made unto

89
00:09:47,404 --> 00:09:52,69
 your fathers

90
00:09:52,475 --> 00:09:57,875
17 For as ye have looked upon the long absence of

91
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:03,275
 your spirits from your bodies to be a bondage, I

92
00:10:03,275 --> 00:10:08,675
 will show unto you how the day of redemption shall

93
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:14,075
 come, and also the restoration of the scattered

94
00:10:14,075 --> 00:10:19,475
 Israel

95
00:10:19,469 --> 00:10:25,469
18 And now ye behold this temple which is in

96
00:10:25,469 --> 00:10:31,469
 Jerusalem, which ye call the house of God, and your

97
00:10:31,469 --> 00:10:37,469
 enemies say that this house shall never fall

98
00:10:37,02 --> 00:10:43,02
19 But, verily I say unto you, that desolation

99
00:10:43,02 --> 00:10:49,02
 shall come upon this generation as a thief in the

100
00:10:49,02 --> 00:10:55,02
 night, and this people shall be destroyed and

101
00:10:55,02 --> 00:11:01,02
 scattered among all nations

102
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,66
20 And this temple which ye now see shall be

103
00:11:04,66 --> 00:11:07,993
 thrown down that there shall not be left one stone upon

104
00:11:07,993 --> 00:11:11,326
 another

105
00:11:11,855 --> 00:11:17,855
21 And it shall come to pass, that this generation

106
00:11:17,855 --> 00:11:23,855
 of Jews shall not pass away until every

107
00:11:23,855 --> 00:11:29,855
 desolation which I have told you concerning them shall come

108
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:35,855
 to pass

109
00:11:35,345 --> 00:11:39,012
22 Ye say that ye know that the end of the world

110
00:11:39,012 --> 00:11:42,679
 cometh; ye say also that ye know that the heavens

111
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:46,346
 and the earth shall pass away

112
00:11:46,856 --> 00:11:53,856
23 And in this ye say truly, for so it is; but

113
00:11:53,856 --> 00:12:00,856
 these things which I have told you shall not pass

114
00:12:00,856 --> 00:12:07,856
 away until all shall be fulfilled

115
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:12,143
24 And this I have told you concerning Jerusalem;

116
00:12:12,143 --> 00:12:17,143
 and when that day shall come, shall a remnant be

117
00:12:17,143 --> 00:12:22,143
 scattered among all nations

118
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:28,309
25 But they shall be gathered again; but they

119
00:12:28,309 --> 00:12:33,976
 shall remain until the times of the Gentiles be

120
00:12:33,976 --> 00:12:39,643
 fulfilled

121
00:12:39,943 --> 00:12:44,943
26 And in that day shall be heard of wars and

122
00:12:44,943 --> 00:12:49,943
 rumors of wars, and the whole earth shall be in

123
00:12:49,943 --> 00:12:54,943
 commotion, and men’s hearts shall fail them, and they

124
00:12:54,943 --> 00:12:59,943
 shall say that Christ delayeth his coming until the

125
00:12:59,943 --> 00:13:04,943
 end of the earth

126
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:10,217
27 And the love of men shall wax cold, and

127
00:13:10,217 --> 00:13:15,717
 iniquity shall abound

128
00:13:15,244 --> 00:13:19,744
28 And when the times of the Gentiles is come in,

129
00:13:19,744 --> 00:13:24,244
 a light shall break forth among them that sit in

130
00:13:24,244 --> 00:13:28,744
 darkness, and it shall be the fulness of my gospel

131
00:13:28,744 --> 00:13:33,244


132
00:13:33,596 --> 00:13:38,929
29 But they receive it not; for they perceive not

133
00:13:38,929 --> 00:13:44,262
 the light, and they turn their hearts from me

134
00:13:44,262 --> 00:13:49,595
 because of the precepts of men

135
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:53,412
30 And in that generation shall the times of the

136
00:13:53,412 --> 00:13:56,912
 Gentiles be fulfilled

137
00:13:56,686 --> 00:14:02,936
31 And there shall be men standing in that

138
00:14:02,936 --> 00:14:09,186
 generation, that shall not pass until they shall see an

139
00:14:09,186 --> 00:14:15,436
 overflowing scourge; for a desolating sickness

140
00:14:15,436 --> 00:14:21,686
 shall cover the land

141
00:14:21,21 --> 00:14:27,21
32 But my disciples shall stand in holy places,

142
00:14:27,21 --> 00:14:33,21
 and shall not be moved; but among the wicked, men

143
00:14:33,21 --> 00:14:39,21
 shall lift up their voices and curse God and die

144
00:14:39,729 --> 00:14:44,329
33 And there shall be earthquakes also in divers

145
00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:48,929
 places, and many desolations; yet men will harden

146
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:53,529
 their hearts against me, and they will take up the

147
00:14:53,529 --> 00:14:58,129
 sword, one against another, and they will kill one

148
00:14:58,129 --> 00:15:02,729
 another

149
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:07,985
34 And now, when I the Lord had spoken these words

150
00:15:07,985 --> 00:15:13,485
 unto my disciples, they were troubled

151
00:15:13,262 --> 00:15:17,512
35 And I said unto them: Be not troubled, for,

152
00:15:17,512 --> 00:15:21,762
 when all these things shall come to pass, ye may know

153
00:15:21,762 --> 00:15:26,012
 that the promises which have been made unto you

154
00:15:26,012 --> 00:15:30,262
 shall be fulfilled

155
00:15:30,546 --> 00:15:34,546
36 And when the light shall begin to break forth,

156
00:15:34,546 --> 00:15:38,546
 it shall be with them like unto a parable which I

157
00:15:38,546 --> 00:15:42,546
 will show you

158
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:47,842
37 Ye look and behold the fig trees, and ye see

159
00:15:47,842 --> 00:15:52,842
 them with your eyes, and ye say when they begin to

160
00:15:52,842 --> 00:15:57,842
 shoot forth, and their leaves are yet tender, that

161
00:15:57,842 --> 00:16:02,842
 summer is now nigh at hand

162
00:16:02,445 --> 00:16:06,112
38 Even so it shall be in that day when they shall

163
00:16:06,112 --> 00:16:09,779
 see all these things, then shall they know that

164
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:13,446
 the hour is nigh

165
00:16:13,456 --> 00:16:17,956
39 And it shall come to pass that he that feareth

166
00:16:17,956 --> 00:16:22,456
 me shall be looking forth for the great day of the

167
00:16:22,456 --> 00:16:26,956
 Lord to come, even for the signs of the coming of

168
00:16:26,956 --> 00:16:31,456
 the Son of Man

169
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:35,79
40 And they shall see signs and wonders, for they

170
00:16:35,79 --> 00:16:40,123
 shall be shown forth in the heavens above, and in

171
00:16:40,123 --> 00:16:44,456
 the earth beneath

172
00:16:44,47 --> 00:17:00,47
41 And they shall behold blood, and fire, and

173
00:17:00,47 --> 00:17:16,47
 vapors of smoke

174
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:19,102
42 And before the day of the Lord shall come, the

175
00:17:19,102 --> 00:17:21,769
 sun shall be darkened, and the moon be turned into

176
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:24,436
 blood, and the stars fall from heaven

177
00:17:24,427 --> 00:17:24,427
43 And the remnant shall be gathered unto this

178
00:17:24,427 --> 00:17:24,427
 place

179
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:28,577
44 And then they shall look for me, and, behold, I

180
00:17:28,577 --> 00:17:32,377
 will come; and they shall see me in the clouds of

181
00:17:32,377 --> 00:17:36,177
 heaven, clothed with power and great glory; with

182
00:17:36,177 --> 00:17:39,977
 all the holy angels; and he that watches not for

183
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:43,777
 me shall be cut off

184
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:49,579
45 But before the arm of the Lord shall fall, an

185
00:17:49,579 --> 00:17:55,829
 angel shall sound his trump, and the saints that

186
00:17:55,829 --> 00:18:02,079
 have slept shall come forth to meet me in the cloud

187
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:08,329


188
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:14,621
46 Wherefore, if ye have slept in peace blessed

189
00:18:14,621 --> 00:18:20,621
 are you; for as you now behold me and know that I

190
00:18:20,621 --> 00:18:26,621
 am, even so shall ye come unto me and your souls

191
00:18:26,621 --> 00:18:32,621
 shall live, and your redemption shall be perfected;

192
00:18:32,621 --> 00:18:38,621
 and the saints shall come forth from the four

193
00:18:38,621 --> 00:18:44,621
 quarters of the earth

194
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:50,123
47 Then shall the arm of the Lord fall upon the

195
00:18:50,123 --> 00:18:56,123
 nations

196
00:18:56,902 --> 00:19:01,402
48 And then shall the Lord set his foot upon this

197
00:19:01,402 --> 00:19:05,902
 mount, and it shall cleave in twain, and the earth

198
00:19:05,902 --> 00:19:10,402
 shall tremble, and reel to and fro, and the

199
00:19:10,402 --> 00:19:14,902
 heavens also shall shake

200
00:19:14,42 --> 00:19:19,67
49 And the Lord shall utter his voice, and all the

201
00:19:19,67 --> 00:19:24,92
 ends of the earth shall hear it; and the nations

202
00:19:24,92 --> 00:19:30,17
 of the earth shall mourn, and they that have

203
00:19:30,17 --> 00:19:35,42
 laughed shall see their folly

204
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:39,957
50 And calamity shall cover the mocker, and the

205
00:19:39,957 --> 00:19:44,707
 scorner shall be consumed; and they that have

206
00:19:44,707 --> 00:19:49,457
 watched for iniquity shall be hewn down and cast into

207
00:19:49,457 --> 00:19:54,207
 the fire

208
00:19:54,96 --> 00:19:59,627
51 And then shall the Jews look upon me and say:

209
00:19:59,627 --> 00:20:04,294
 What are these wounds in thine hands and in thy

210
00:20:04,294 --> 00:20:08,961
 feet

211
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:14,741
52 Then shall they know that I am the Lord; for I

212
00:20:14,741 --> 00:20:20,741
 will say unto them: These wounds are the wounds

213
00:20:20,741 --> 00:20:26,741
 with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.

214
00:20:26,741 --> 00:20:32,741
 I am he who was lifted up. I am Jesus that was

215
00:20:32,741 --> 00:20:38,741
 crucified. I am the Son of God

216
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:44,487
53 And then shall they weep because of their

217
00:20:44,487 --> 00:20:50,487
 iniquities; then shall they lament because they

218
00:20:50,487 --> 00:20:56,487
 persecuted their king

219
00:20:56,005 --> 00:21:01,005
54 And then shall the heathen nations be redeemed,

220
00:21:01,005 --> 00:21:06,005
 and they that knew no law shall have part in the

221
00:21:06,005 --> 00:21:11,005
 first resurrection; and it shall be tolerable for

222
00:21:11,005 --> 00:21:16,005
 them

223
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:22,025
55 And Satan shall be bound, that he shall have no

224
00:21:22,025 --> 00:21:27,525
 place in the hearts of the children of men

225
00:21:27,803 --> 00:21:32,803
56 And at that day, when I shall come in my glory,

226
00:21:32,803 --> 00:21:37,803
 shall the parable be fulfilled which I spake

227
00:21:37,803 --> 00:21:42,803
 concerning the ten virgins

228
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:48,202
57 For they that are wise and have received the

229
00:21:48,202 --> 00:21:53,601
 truth, and have taken the Holy Spirit for their

230
00:21:53,601 --> 00:21:59,002
 guide, and have not been deceived—verily I say unto

231
00:21:59,002 --> 00:22:04,401
 you, they shall not be hewn down and cast into the

232
00:22:04,401 --> 00:22:09,802
 fire, but shall abide the day

233
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:15,045
58 And the earth shall be given unto them for an

234
00:22:15,045 --> 00:22:20,295
 inheritance; and they shall multiply and wax

235
00:22:20,295 --> 00:22:25,545
 strong, and their children shall grow up without sin

236
00:22:25,545 --> 00:22:30,795
 unto salvation

237
00:22:30,332 --> 00:22:36,332
59 For the Lord shall be in their midst, and his

238
00:22:36,332 --> 00:22:42,332
 glory shall be upon them, and he will be their king

239
00:22:42,332 --> 00:22:48,332
 and their lawgiver

240
00:22:48,1 --> 00:22:53,1
60 And now, behold, I say unto you, it shall not

241
00:22:53,1 --> 00:22:58,1
 be given unto you to know any further concerning

242
00:22:58,1 --> 00:23:03,1
 this chapter, until the New Testament be translated,

243
00:23:03,1 --> 00:23:08,1
 and in it all these things shall be made known

244
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:12,288
61 Wherefore I give unto you that ye may now

245
00:23:12,288 --> 00:23:15,955
 translate it, that ye may be prepared for the things to

246
00:23:15,955 --> 00:23:19,622
 come

247
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:23,148
62 For verily I say unto you, that great things

248
00:23:23,148 --> 00:23:27,148
 await you

249
00:23:27,94 --> 00:23:33,94
63 Ye hear of wars in foreign lands; but, behold,

250
00:23:33,94 --> 00:23:39,94
 I say unto you, they are nigh, even at your doors,

251
00:23:39,94 --> 00:23:45,94
 and not many years hence ye shall hear of wars in

252
00:23:45,94 --> 00:23:51,94
 your own lands

253
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:58,33
64 Wherefore I, the Lord, have said, gather ye out

254
00:23:58,33 --> 00:24:04,663
 from the eastern lands, assemble ye yourselves

255
00:24:04,663 --> 00:24:10,996
 together ye elders of my church; go ye forth into

256
00:24:10,996 --> 00:24:17,329
 the western countries, call upon the inhabitants to

257
00:24:17,329 --> 00:24:23,662
 repent, and inasmuch as they do repent, build up

258
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:29,995
 churches unto me

259
00:24:29,485 --> 00:24:35,485
65 And with one heart and with one mind, gather up

260
00:24:35,485 --> 00:24:41,485
 your riches that ye may purchase an inheritance

261
00:24:41,485 --> 00:24:47,485
 which shall hereafter be appointed unto you

262
00:24:47,002 --> 00:24:53,002
66 And it shall be called the New Jerusalem, a

263
00:24:53,002 --> 00:24:59,002
 land of peace, a city of refuge, a place of safety

264
00:24:59,002 --> 00:25:05,002
 for the saints of the Most High God

265
00:25:05,354 --> 00:25:09,604
67 And the glory of the Lord shall be there, and

266
00:25:09,604 --> 00:25:13,854
 the terror of the Lord also shall be there,

267
00:25:13,854 --> 00:25:18,104
 insomuch that the wicked will not come unto it, and it

268
00:25:18,104 --> 00:25:22,354
 shall be called Zion

269
00:25:22,388 --> 00:25:28,055
68 And it shall come to pass among the wicked,

270
00:25:28,055 --> 00:25:33,722
 that every man that will not take his sword against

271
00:25:33,722 --> 00:25:39,389
 his neighbor must needs flee unto Zion for safety

272
00:25:39,188 --> 00:25:44,521
69 And there shall be gathered unto it out of

273
00:25:44,521 --> 00:25:49,854
 every nation under heaven; and it shall be the only

274
00:25:49,854 --> 00:25:55,187
 people that shall not be at war one with another

275
00:25:55,237 --> 00:25:58,987
70 And it shall be said among the wicked: Let us

276
00:25:58,987 --> 00:26:02,737
 not go up to battle against Zion, for the

277
00:26:02,737 --> 00:26:06,487
 inhabitants of Zion are terrible; wherefore we cannot

278
00:26:06,487 --> 00:26:10,237
 stand

279
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:16,736
71 And it shall come to pass that the righteous

280
00:26:16,736 --> 00:26:22,486
 shall be gathered out from among all nations, and

281
00:26:22,486 --> 00:26:28,236
 shall come to Zion, singing with songs of

282
00:26:28,236 --> 00:26:33,986
 everlasting joy

283
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:39,591
72 And now I say unto you, keep these things from

284
00:26:39,591 --> 00:26:45,924
 going abroad unto the world until it is expedient

285
00:26:45,924 --> 00:26:52,257
 in me, that ye may accomplish this work in the

286
00:26:52,257 --> 00:26:58,59
 eyes of the people, and in the eyes of your enemies,

287
00:26:58,59 --> 00:27:04,923
 that they may not know your works until ye have

288
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:11,256
 accomplished the thing which I have commanded you

289
00:27:11,513 --> 00:27:15,513
73 That when they shall know it, that they may

290
00:27:15,513 --> 00:27:19,513
 consider these things

291
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:24,37
74 For when the Lord shall appear he shall be

292
00:27:24,37 --> 00:27:29,703
 terrible unto them, that fear may seize upon them, and

293
00:27:29,703 --> 00:27:35,036
 they shall stand afar off and tremble

294
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:43,238
75 And all nations shall be afraid because of the

295
00:27:43,238 --> 00:27:50,905
 terror of the Lord, and the power of his might.

296
00:27:50,905 --> 00:27:58,572
 Even so. Amen.
