00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:18,278
Section 60 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:18,278 --> 00:00:25,278
 the Prophet, in Independence, Jackson County,

3
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:32,278
 Missouri, August 8, 1831. On this occasion the elders

4
00:00:32,278 --> 00:00:39,278
 who had traveled to Jackson County and participated

5
00:00:39,278 --> 00:00:46,278
 in the dedication of the land and the temple site

6
00:00:46,278 --> 00:00:53,278
 desired to know what they were to do. 
1–9, The

7
00:00:53,278 --> 00:01:00,278
 elders are to preach the gospel in the

8
00:01:00,278 --> 00:01:07,278
 congregations of the wicked; 
10–14, They should not idle away

9
00:01:07,278 --> 00:01:14,278
 their time, nor bury their talents; 
15–17, They

10
00:01:14,278 --> 00:01:21,278
 may wash their feet as a testimony against those

11
00:01:21,278 --> 00:01:28,278
 who reject the gospel.

12
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:33,955
1 Behold, thus saith the Lord unto the elders of

13
00:01:33,955 --> 00:01:39,455
 his church, who are to return speedily to the land

14
00:01:39,455 --> 00:01:44,955
 from whence they came: Behold, it pleaseth me,

15
00:01:44,955 --> 00:01:50,455
 that you have come up hither

16
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:55,877
2 But with some I am not well pleased, for they

17
00:01:55,877 --> 00:02:01,277
 will not open their mouths, but they hide the talent

18
00:02:01,277 --> 00:02:06,677
 which I have given unto them, because of the fear

19
00:02:06,677 --> 00:02:12,077
 of man. Wo unto such, for mine anger is kindled

20
00:02:12,077 --> 00:02:17,477
 against them

21
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:22,405
3 And it shall come to pass, if they are not more

22
00:02:22,405 --> 00:02:27,072
 faithful unto me, it shall be taken away, even

23
00:02:27,072 --> 00:02:31,739
 that which they have

24
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:40,751
4 For I, the Lord, rule in the heavens above, and

25
00:02:40,751 --> 00:02:50,001
 among the armies of the earth; and in the day when

26
00:02:50,001 --> 00:02:59,251
 I shall make up my jewels, all men shall know

27
00:02:59,251 --> 00:03:08,501
 what it is that bespeaketh the power of God

28
00:03:08,004 --> 00:03:12,837
5 But, verily, I will speak unto you concerning

29
00:03:12,837 --> 00:03:17,67
 your journey unto the land from whence you came. Let

30
00:03:17,67 --> 00:03:22,503
 there be a craft made, or bought, as seemeth you

31
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:27,336
 good, it mattereth not unto me, and take your

32
00:03:27,336 --> 00:03:32,169
 journey speedily for the place which is called

33
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:37,002
 St. Louis

34
00:03:37,267 --> 00:03:43,934
6 And from thence let my servants, Sidney Rigdon,

35
00:03:43,934 --> 00:03:50,601
 Joseph Smith, Jun., and Oliver Cowdery, take their

36
00:03:50,601 --> 00:03:57,268
 journey for Cincinnati

37
00:03:57,254 --> 00:04:02,654
7 And in this place let them lift up their voice

38
00:04:02,654 --> 00:04:08,054
 and declare my word with loud voices, without wrath

39
00:04:08,054 --> 00:04:13,454
 or doubting, lifting up holy hands upon them. For

40
00:04:13,454 --> 00:04:18,854
 I am able to make you holy, and your sins are

41
00:04:18,854 --> 00:04:24,254
 forgiven you

42
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:32,748
8 And let the residue take their journey from

43
00:04:32,748 --> 00:04:40,498
 St. Louis, two by two, and preach the word, not in

44
00:04:40,498 --> 00:04:48,248
 haste, among the congregations of the wicked, until

45
00:04:48,248 --> 00:04:55,998
 they return to the churches from whence they came

46
00:04:55,345 --> 00:05:02,345
9 And all this for the good of the churches; for

47
00:05:02,345 --> 00:05:09,345
 this intent have I sent them

48
00:05:09,626 --> 00:05:16,293
10 And let my servant Edward Partridge impart of

49
00:05:16,293 --> 00:05:22,96
 the money which I have given him, a portion unto

50
00:05:22,96 --> 00:05:29,627
 mine elders who are commanded to return

51
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:34,462
11 And he that is able, let him return it by the

52
00:05:34,462 --> 00:05:39,795
 way of the agent; and he that is not, of him it is

53
00:05:39,795 --> 00:05:45,128
 not required

54
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:49,111
12 And now I speak of the residue who are to come

55
00:05:49,111 --> 00:05:53,111
 unto this land

56
00:05:53,904 --> 00:05:58,904
13 Behold, they have been sent to preach my gospel

57
00:05:58,904 --> 00:06:03,904
 among the congregations of the wicked; wherefore,

58
00:06:03,904 --> 00:06:08,904
 I give unto them a commandment, thus: Thou shalt

59
00:06:08,904 --> 00:06:13,904
 not idle away thy time, neither shalt thou bury

60
00:06:13,904 --> 00:06:18,904
 thy talent that it may not be known

61
00:06:18,428 --> 00:06:24,228
14 And after thou hast come up unto the land of

62
00:06:24,228 --> 00:06:30,028
 Zion, and hast proclaimed my word, thou shalt

63
00:06:30,028 --> 00:06:35,828
 speedily return, proclaiming my word among the

64
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:41,628
 congregations of the wicked, not in haste, neither in wrath

65
00:06:41,628 --> 00:06:47,428
 nor with strife

66
00:06:47,424 --> 00:06:53,424
15 And shake off the dust of thy feet against

67
00:06:53,424 --> 00:06:59,424
 those who receive thee not, not in their presence,

68
00:06:59,424 --> 00:07:05,424
 lest thou provoke them, but in secret; and wash thy

69
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:11,424
 feet, as a testimony against them in the day of

70
00:07:11,424 --> 00:07:17,424
 judgment

71
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:22,437
16 Behold, this is sufficient for you, and the

72
00:07:22,437 --> 00:07:27,437
 will of him who hath sent you

73
00:07:27,998 --> 00:07:29,998
17 And by the mouth of my servant Joseph Smith,

74
00:07:29,998 --> 00:07:31,998
 Jun., it shall be made known concerning Sidney

75
00:07:31,998 --> 00:07:33,998
 Rigdon and Oliver Cowdery. The residue hereafter. Even

76
00:07:33,998 --> 00:07:35,998
 so. Amen.
