00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 60 Revelation given through Joseph

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Smith the Prophet, in Independence, Jackson County,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Missouri, August 8, 1831. On this occasion the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
elders who had traveled to Jackson County and

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
participated in the dedication of the land and

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the temple site desired to know what they were

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
to do. 
1–9, The elders are to preach the

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
gospel in the congregations of the wicked; 
10–14,

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
They should not idle away their time, nor bury

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
their talents; 
15–17, They may wash their feet

11
00:00:00,0 --> 01:26:53,
as a testimony against those who reject the gospel. 

12
01:26:53,0 --> 01:26:53,0
1 Behold, thus saith the Lord unto the

13
01:26:53,0 --> 01:26:53,0
elders of his church, who are to return speedily

14
01:26:53,0 --> 01:26:53,0
to the land from whence they came: Behold,

15
01:26:53,0 --> 01:49:54,
it pleaseth me, that you have come up hither;

16
01:49:54,0 --> 01:49:54,0
2 But with some I am not well pleased, for

17
01:49:54,0 --> 01:49:54,0
they will not open their mouths, but they

18
01:49:54,0 --> 01:49:54,0
hide the talent which I have given unto

19
01:49:54,0 --> 01:49:54,0
them, because of the fear of man. Wo unto

20
01:49:54,0 --> 02:17:30,
such, for mine anger is kindled against them.

21
02:17:30,0 --> 02:17:30,0
3 And it shall come to pass, if they

22
02:17:30,0 --> 02:17:30,0
are not more faithful unto me, it shall

23
02:17:30,0 --> 02:30:34,
be taken away, even that which they have.

24
02:30:34,0 --> 02:30:34,0
4 For I, the Lord, rule in the heavens

25
02:30:34,0 --> 02:30:34,0
above, and among the armies of the

26
02:30:34,0 --> 02:30:34,0
earth; and in the day when I shall make

27
02:30:34,0 --> 02:30:34,0
up my jewels, all men shall know what

28
02:30:34,0 --> 03:07:07,
it is that bespeaketh the power of God.

29
03:07:07,0 --> 03:07:07,0
5 But, verily, I will speak unto you

30
03:07:07,0 --> 03:07:07,0
concerning your journey unto the

31
03:07:07,0 --> 03:07:07,0
land from whence you came. Let there

32
03:07:07,0 --> 03:07:07,0
be a craft made, or bought, as

33
03:07:07,0 --> 03:07:07,0
seemeth you good, it mattereth not unto

34
03:07:07,0 --> 03:07:07,0
me, and take your journey speedily for

35
03:07:07,0 --> 03:36:09,
the place which is called St. Louis.

36
03:36:09,0 --> 03:36:09,0
6 And from thence let my

37
03:36:09,0 --> 03:36:09,0
servants, Sidney Rigdon, Joseph

38
03:36:09,0 --> 03:36:09,0
Smith, Jun., and Oliver Cowdery,

39
03:36:09,0 --> 03:56:14,
take their journey for Cincinnati;

40
03:56:14,0 --> 03:56:14,0
7 And in this place let them

41
03:56:14,0 --> 03:56:14,0
lift up their voice and declare

42
03:56:14,0 --> 03:56:14,0
my word with loud voices,

43
03:56:14,0 --> 03:56:14,0
without wrath or doubting,

44
03:56:14,0 --> 03:56:14,0
lifting up holy hands upon them. For

45
03:56:14,0 --> 03:56:14,0
I am able to make you holy,

46
03:56:14,0 --> 04:15:13,
and your sins are forgiven you.

47
04:15:13,0 --> 04:15:13,0
8 And let the residue take

48
04:15:13,0 --> 04:15:13,0
their journey from St. Louis,

49
04:15:13,0 --> 04:15:13,0
two by two, and preach the

50
04:15:13,0 --> 04:15:13,0
word, not in haste, among

51
04:15:13,0 --> 04:15:13,0
the congregations of the

52
04:15:13,0 --> 04:15:13,0
wicked, until they return to the

53
04:15:13,0 --> 04:22:16,
churches from whence they came.

54
04:22:16,0 --> 04:22:16,0
9 And all this for the

55
04:22:16,0 --> 04:22:16,0
good of the churches; for

56
04:22:16,0 --> 04:23:20,
this intent have I sent them.

57
04:23:20,0 --> 04:23:20,0
10 And let my servant

58
04:23:20,0 --> 04:23:20,0
Edward Partridge impart

59
04:23:20,0 --> 04:23:20,0
of the money which I

60
04:23:20,0 --> 04:23:20,0
have given him, a portion

61
04:23:20,0 --> 04:23:20,0
unto mine elders who

62
04:23:20,0 --> 04:54:20,
are commanded to return;

63
04:54:20,0 --> 04:54:20,0
11 And he that is

64
04:54:20,0 --> 04:54:20,0
able, let him return it by

65
04:54:20,0 --> 04:54:20,0
the way of the agent;

66
04:54:20,0 --> 04:54:20,0
and he that is not,

67
04:54:20,0 --> 05:08:24,
of him it is not required.

68
05:08:24,0 --> 05:08:24,0
12 And now I speak of

69
05:08:24,0 --> 05:08:24,0
the residue who are

70
05:08:24,0 --> 05:28:01,
to come unto this land.

71
05:28:01,0 --> 05:28:01,0
13 Behold, they

72
05:28:01,0 --> 05:28:01,0
have been sent to

73
05:28:01,0 --> 05:28:01,0
preach my gospel among

74
05:28:01,0 --> 05:28:01,0
the congregations

75
05:28:01,0 --> 05:28:01,0
of the wicked;

76
05:28:01,0 --> 05:28:01,0
wherefore, I give unto

77
05:28:01,0 --> 05:28:01,0
them a commandment,

78
05:28:01,0 --> 05:28:01,0
thus: Thou shalt

79
05:28:01,0 --> 05:28:01,0
not idle away thy

80
05:28:01,0 --> 05:28:01,0
time, neither shalt

81
05:28:01,0 --> 05:28:01,0
thou bury thy talent

82
05:28:01,0 --> 05:41:05,
that it may not be known.

83
05:41:05,0 --> 05:41:05,0
14 And after thou

84
05:41:05,0 --> 05:41:05,0
hast come up unto

85
05:41:05,0 --> 05:41:05,0
the land of Zion,

86
05:41:05,0 --> 05:41:05,0
and hast

87
05:41:05,0 --> 05:41:05,0
proclaimed my word, thou

88
05:41:05,0 --> 05:41:05,0
shalt speedily

89
05:41:05,0 --> 05:41:05,0
return, proclaiming my

90
05:41:05,0 --> 05:41:05,0
word among the

91
05:41:05,0 --> 05:41:05,0
congregations of the

92
05:41:05,0 --> 05:41:05,0
wicked, not in

93
05:41:05,0 --> 05:41:05,0
haste, neither in

94
05:41:05,0 --> 05:44:44,
wrath nor with strife.

95
05:44:44,0 --> 05:44:44,0
15 And shake off

96
05:44:44,0 --> 05:44:44,0
the dust of thy

97
05:44:44,0 --> 05:44:44,0
feet against those

98
05:44:44,0 --> 05:44:44,0
who receive thee

99
05:44:44,0 --> 05:44:44,0
not, not in

100
05:44:44,0 --> 05:44:44,0
their presence, lest

101
05:44:44,0 --> 05:44:44,0
thou provoke

102
05:44:44,0 --> 05:44:44,0
them, but in secret;

103
05:44:44,0 --> 05:44:44,0
and wash thy

104
05:44:44,0 --> 05:44:44,0
feet, as a testimony

105
05:44:44,0 --> 05:44:44,0
against them in

106
05:44:44,0 --> 05:51:47,
the day of judgment.

107
05:51:47,0 --> 05:51:47,0
16 Behold, this

108
05:51:47,0 --> 05:51:47,0
is sufficient

109
05:51:47,0 --> 05:51:47,0
for you, and

110
05:51:47,0 --> 05:51:47,0
the will of him

111
05:51:47,0 --> 06:16:48,
who hath sent you.

112
06:16:48,0 --> 06:16:48,0
17 And by the

113
06:16:48,0 --> 06:16:48,0
mouth of my

114
06:16:48,0 --> 06:16:48,0
servant Joseph

115
06:16:48,0 --> 06:16:48,0
Smith, Jun., it

116
06:16:48,0 --> 06:16:48,0
shall be made

117
06:16:48,0 --> 06:16:48,0
known

118
06:16:48,0 --> 06:16:48,0
concerning Sidney

119
06:16:48,0 --> 06:16:48,0
Rigdon and Oliver

120
06:16:48,0 --> 06:16:48,0
Cowdery. The

121
06:16:48,0 --> 06:16:48,0
residue

122
06:16:48,0 --> 06:45:50,
hereafter. Even so. Amen.
