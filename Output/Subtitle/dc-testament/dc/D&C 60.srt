00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:04,182
Section 60 Revelation given through Joseph

2
00:00:04,182 --> 00:00:08,364
Smith the Prophet, in Independence, Jackson County,

3
00:00:08,364 --> 00:00:12,546
Missouri, August 8, 1831. On this occasion the

4
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:16,728
elders who had traveled to Jackson County and

5
00:00:16,728 --> 00:00:20,91
participated in the dedication of the land and

6
00:00:20,91 --> 00:00:25,092
the temple site desired to know what they were

7
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:29,274
to do. 
1–9, The elders are to preach the

8
00:00:29,274 --> 00:00:33,456
gospel in the congregations of the wicked; 
10–14,

9
00:00:33,456 --> 00:00:37,638
They should not idle away their time, nor bury

10
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:41,82
their talents; 
15–17, They may wash their feet

11
00:00:41,82 --> 00:00:46,997
as a testimony against those who reject the gospel. 

12
00:00:46,997 --> 00:00:45,997
1 Behold, thus saith the Lord unto the

13
00:00:45,997 --> 00:00:44,997
elders of his church, who are to return speedily

14
00:00:44,997 --> 00:00:43,997
to the land from whence they came: Behold,

15
00:00:43,997 --> 00:00:42,659
it pleaseth me, that you have come up hither;

16
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:51,659
2 But with some I am not well pleased, for

17
00:00:51,659 --> 00:01:00,659
they will not open their mouths, but they

18
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:09,659
hide the talent which I have given unto

19
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:18,659
them, because of the fear of man. Wo unto

20
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:27,704
such, for mine anger is kindled against them.

21
00:01:27,704 --> 00:01:34,704
3 And it shall come to pass, if they

22
00:01:34,704 --> 00:01:41,704
are not more faithful unto me, it shall

23
00:01:41,704 --> 00:01:48,775
be taken away, even that which they have.

24
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:54,375
4 For I, the Lord, rule in the heavens

25
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:59,975
above, and among the armies of the

26
00:01:59,975 --> 00:02:05,575
earth; and in the day when I shall make

27
00:02:05,575 --> 00:02:11,175
up my jewels, all men shall know what

28
00:02:11,175 --> 00:02:16,87
it is that bespeaketh the power of God.

29
00:02:16,87 --> 00:02:18,87
5 But, verily, I will speak unto you

30
00:02:18,87 --> 00:02:20,87
concerning your journey unto the

31
00:02:20,87 --> 00:02:22,87
land from whence you came. Let there

32
00:02:22,87 --> 00:02:24,87
be a craft made, or bought, as

33
00:02:24,87 --> 00:02:26,87
seemeth you good, it mattereth not unto

34
00:02:26,87 --> 00:02:28,87
me, and take your journey speedily for

35
00:02:28,87 --> 00:02:30,951
the place which is called St. Louis.

36
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:33,701
6 And from thence let my

37
00:02:33,701 --> 00:02:36,451
servants, Sidney Rigdon, Joseph

38
00:02:36,451 --> 00:02:39,201
Smith, Jun., and Oliver Cowdery,

39
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:41,962
take their journey for Cincinnati;

40
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:45,676
7 And in this place let them

41
00:02:45,676 --> 00:02:49,39
lift up their voice and declare

42
00:02:49,39 --> 00:02:53,104
my word with loud voices,

43
00:02:53,104 --> 00:02:56,818
without wrath or doubting,

44
00:02:56,818 --> 00:03:00,532
lifting up holy hands upon them. For

45
00:03:00,532 --> 00:03:04,246
I am able to make you holy,

46
00:03:04,246 --> 00:03:07,003
and your sins are forgiven you.

47
00:03:07,003 --> 00:03:11,146
8 And let the residue take

48
00:03:11,146 --> 00:03:15,289
their journey from St. Louis,

49
00:03:15,289 --> 00:03:19,432
two by two, and preach the

50
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:23,575
word, not in haste, among

51
00:03:23,575 --> 00:03:27,718
the congregations of the

52
00:03:27,718 --> 00:03:31,861
wicked, until they return to the

53
00:03:31,861 --> 00:03:36,066
churches from whence they came.

54
00:03:36,066 --> 00:03:42,399
9 And all this for the

55
00:03:42,399 --> 00:03:48,732
good of the churches; for

56
00:03:48,732 --> 00:03:55,085
this intent have I sent them.

57
00:03:55,085 --> 00:03:55,085
10 And let my servant

58
00:03:55,085 --> 00:03:55,085
Edward Partridge impart

59
00:03:55,085 --> 00:03:55,085
of the money which I

60
00:03:55,085 --> 00:03:55,085
have given him, a portion

61
00:03:55,085 --> 00:03:55,085
unto mine elders who

62
00:03:55,085 --> 00:03:55,185
are commanded to return;

63
00:03:55,185 --> 00:03:54,185
11 And he that is

64
00:03:54,185 --> 00:03:53,185
able, let him return it by

65
00:03:53,185 --> 00:03:52,185
the way of the agent;

66
00:03:52,185 --> 00:03:51,185
and he that is not,

67
00:03:51,185 --> 00:03:50,847
of him it is not required.

68
00:03:50,847 --> 00:03:52,514
12 And now I speak of

69
00:03:52,514 --> 00:03:54,181
the residue who are

70
00:03:54,181 --> 00:03:55,936
to come unto this land.

71
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:58,353
13 Behold, they

72
00:03:58,353 --> 00:04:00,77
have been sent to

73
00:04:00,77 --> 00:04:03,187
preach my gospel among

74
00:04:03,187 --> 00:04:05,604
the congregations

75
00:04:05,604 --> 00:04:08,021
of the wicked;

76
00:04:08,021 --> 00:04:10,438
wherefore, I give unto

77
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:12,855
them a commandment,

78
00:04:12,855 --> 00:04:15,272
thus: Thou shalt

79
00:04:15,272 --> 00:04:17,689
not idle away thy

80
00:04:17,689 --> 00:04:20,106
time, neither shalt

81
00:04:20,106 --> 00:04:22,523
thou bury thy talent

82
00:04:22,523 --> 00:04:24,03
that it may not be known.

83
00:04:24,03 --> 00:04:26,28
14 And after thou

84
00:04:26,28 --> 00:04:28,53
hast come up unto

85
00:04:28,53 --> 00:04:30,78
the land of Zion,

86
00:04:30,78 --> 00:04:33,03
and hast

87
00:04:33,03 --> 00:04:35,28
proclaimed my word, thou

88
00:04:35,28 --> 00:04:37,53
shalt speedily

89
00:04:37,53 --> 00:04:39,78
return, proclaiming my

90
00:04:39,78 --> 00:04:42,03
word among the

91
00:04:42,03 --> 00:04:44,28
congregations of the

92
00:04:44,28 --> 00:04:46,53
wicked, not in

93
00:04:46,53 --> 00:04:48,78
haste, neither in

94
00:04:48,78 --> 00:04:51,041
wrath nor with strife.

95
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:51,291
15 And shake off

96
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:51,541
the dust of thy

97
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:51,791
feet against those

98
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:52,041
who receive thee

99
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:52,291
not, not in

100
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:52,541
their presence, lest

101
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:52,791
thou provoke

102
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:53,041
them, but in secret;

103
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:53,291
and wash thy

104
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:53,541
feet, as a testimony

105
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:53,791
against them in

106
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:54,694
the day of judgment.

107
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:57,494
16 Behold, this

108
00:04:57,494 --> 00:05:00,294
is sufficient

109
00:05:00,294 --> 00:05:03,094
for you, and

110
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,894
the will of him

111
00:05:05,894 --> 00:05:08,775
who hath sent you.

112
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:10,593
17 And by the

113
00:05:10,593 --> 00:05:12,411
mouth of my

114
00:05:12,411 --> 00:05:14,229
servant Joseph

115
00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:16,047
Smith, Jun., it

116
00:05:16,047 --> 00:05:17,865
shall be made

117
00:05:17,865 --> 00:05:19,683
known

118
00:05:19,683 --> 00:05:21,501
concerning Sidney

119
00:05:21,501 --> 00:05:23,319
Rigdon and Oliver

120
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:25,137
Cowdery. The

121
00:05:25,137 --> 00:05:26,955
residue

122
00:05:26,955 --> 00:05:28,411
hereafter. Even so. Amen.
