00:00:55,368 --> 00:00:59,768
 verily thus saith the Lord unto you: My servant

00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:04,168
 Brigham, it is no more required at your hand to leave

10
00:01:04,168 --> 00:01:08,568
 your family as in times past, for your offering is

11
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:12,968
 acceptable to me

12
00:01:12,956 --> 00:01:16,956
2 I have seen your labor and toil in journeyings

13
00:01:16,956 --> 00:01:20,956
 for my name

14
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:24,58
3 I therefore command you to send my word abroad,

15
00:01:24,58 --> 00:01:28,913
 and take especial care of your family from this

16
00:01:28,913 --> 00:01:33,246
 time, henceforth and forever. Amen.
