Young, verily thus saith the Lord unto you:

9
00:49:58,0 --> 00:49:58,0
My servant Brigham, it is no more required

10
00:49:58,0 --> 00:49:58,0
at your hand to leave your family as in

11
00:49:58,0 --> 01:12:01,
times past, for your offering is acceptable to me.

12
01:12:01,0 --> 01:12:01,0
2 I have seen your labor and

13
01:12:01,0 --> 01:19:04,
toil in journeyings for my name.

14
01:19:04,0 --> 01:19:04,0
3 I therefore command you

15
01:19:04,0 --> 01:19:04,0
to send my word abroad,

16
01:19:04,0 --> 01:19:04,0
and take especial care of

17
01:19:04,0 --> 01:19:04,0
your family from this time,

18
01:19:04,0 --> 01:32:08,
henceforth and forever. Amen.
