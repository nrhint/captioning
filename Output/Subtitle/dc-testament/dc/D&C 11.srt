00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:17,278
Section 11 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:23,278
 the Prophet to his brother Hyrum Smith, at Harmony,

3
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:29,278
 Pennsylvania, May 1829. This revelation was

4
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:35,278
 received through the Urim and Thummim in answer to

5
00:00:35,278 --> 00:00:41,278
 Joseph’s supplication and inquiry. Joseph Smith’s

6
00:00:41,278 --> 00:00:47,278
 history suggests that this revelation was received

7
00:00:47,278 --> 00:00:53,278
 after the restoration of the Aaronic Priesthood.

8
00:00:53,278 --> 00:00:59,278
1–6, Laborers in the vineyard will gain salvation;

9
00:00:59,278 --> 00:01:05,278
7–14, Seek wisdom, cry repentance, trust in the

10
00:01:05,278 --> 00:01:11,278
 Spirit; 
15–22, Keep the commandments, and study the

11
00:01:11,278 --> 00:01:17,278
 Lord’s word; 
23–27, Deny not the spirit of

12
00:01:17,278 --> 00:01:23,278
 revelation and of prophecy; 
28–30, Those who receive

13
00:01:23,278 --> 00:01:29,278
 Christ become the sons of God.

14
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:35,023
1 A great and marvelous work is about to come

15
00:01:35,023 --> 00:01:40,523
 forth among the children of men

16
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:48,551
2 Behold, I am God; give heed to my word, which is

17
00:01:48,551 --> 00:01:56,301
 quick and powerful, sharper than a two-edged

18
00:01:56,301 --> 00:02:04,051
 sword, to the dividing asunder of both joints and

19
00:02:04,051 --> 00:02:11,801
 marrow; therefore give heed unto my word

20
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:18,199
3 Behold, the field is white already to harvest;

21
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:24,399
 therefore, whoso desireth to reap let him thrust in

22
00:02:24,399 --> 00:02:30,599
 his sickle with his might, and reap while the day

23
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:36,799
 lasts, that he may treasure up for his soul

24
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:42,999
 everlasting salvation in the kingdom of God

25
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:48,929
4 Yea, whosoever will thrust in his sickle and

26
00:02:48,929 --> 00:02:54,929
 reap, the same is called of God

27
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:57,774
5 Therefore, if you will ask of me you shall

28
00:02:57,774 --> 00:03:01,107
 receive; if you will knock it shall be opened unto you

29
00:03:01,107 --> 00:03:04,44


30
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:10,985
6 Now, as you have asked, behold, I say unto you,

31
00:03:10,985 --> 00:03:16,985
 keep my commandments, and seek to bring forth and

32
00:03:16,985 --> 00:03:22,985
 establish the cause of Zion

33
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:29,286
7 Seek not for riches but for wisdom; and, behold,

34
00:03:29,286 --> 00:03:36,036
 the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto you,

35
00:03:36,036 --> 00:03:42,786
 and then shall you be made rich. Behold, he that

36
00:03:42,786 --> 00:03:49,536
 hath eternal life is rich

37
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:53,279
8 Verily, verily, I say unto you, even as you

38
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:57,529
 desire of me so it shall be done unto you; and, if you

39
00:03:57,529 --> 00:04:01,779
 desire, you shall be the means of doing much good

40
00:04:01,779 --> 00:04:06,029
 in this generation

41
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:11,096
9 Say nothing but repentance unto this generation.

42
00:04:11,096 --> 00:04:15,846
 Keep my commandments, and assist to bring forth

43
00:04:15,846 --> 00:04:20,596
 my work, according to my commandments, and you

44
00:04:20,596 --> 00:04:25,346
 shall be blessed

45
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:30,098
10 Behold, thou hast a gift, or thou shalt have a

46
00:04:30,098 --> 00:04:35,098
 gift if thou wilt desire of me in faith, with an

47
00:04:35,098 --> 00:04:40,098
 honest heart, believing in the power of Jesus

48
00:04:40,098 --> 00:04:45,098
 Christ, or in my power which speaketh unto thee

49
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:50,385
11 For, behold, it is I that speak; behold, I am

50
00:04:50,385 --> 00:04:55,385
 the light which shineth in darkness, and by my

51
00:04:55,385 --> 00:05:00,385
 power I give these words unto thee

52
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:05,867
12 And now, verily, verily, I say unto thee, put

53
00:05:05,867 --> 00:05:10,867
 your trust in that Spirit which leadeth to do

54
00:05:10,867 --> 00:05:15,867
 good—yea, to do justly, to walk humbly, to judge

55
00:05:15,867 --> 00:05:20,867
 righteously; and this is my Spirit

56
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:25,821
13 Verily, verily, I say unto you, I will impart

57
00:05:25,821 --> 00:05:30,821
 unto you of my Spirit, which shall enlighten your

58
00:05:30,821 --> 00:05:35,821
 mind, which shall fill your soul with joy

59
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:41,585
14 And then shall ye know, or by this shall you

60
00:05:41,585 --> 00:05:47,835
 know, all things whatsoever you desire of me, which

61
00:05:47,835 --> 00:05:54,085
 are pertaining unto things of righteousness, in

62
00:05:54,085 --> 00:06:00,335
 faith believing in me that you shall receive

63
00:06:00,36 --> 00:06:04,693
15 Behold, I command you that you need not suppose

64
00:06:04,693 --> 00:06:09,026
 that you are called to preach until you are

65
00:06:09,026 --> 00:06:13,359
 called

66
00:06:13,64 --> 00:06:17,973
16 Wait a little longer, until you shall have my

67
00:06:17,973 --> 00:06:22,306
 word, my rock, my church, and my gospel, that you

68
00:06:22,306 --> 00:06:26,639
 may know of a surety my doctrine

69
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:29,653
17 And then, behold, according to your desires,

70
00:06:29,653 --> 00:06:32,653
 yea, even according to your faith shall it be done

71
00:06:32,653 --> 00:06:35,653
 unto you

72
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:42,195
18 Keep my commandments; hold your peace; appeal

73
00:06:42,195 --> 00:06:48,695
 unto my Spirit

74
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:53,258
19 Yea, cleave unto me with all your heart, that

75
00:06:53,258 --> 00:06:58,508
 you may assist in bringing to light those things of

76
00:06:58,508 --> 00:07:03,758
 which has been spoken—yea, the translation of my

77
00:07:03,758 --> 00:07:09,008
 work; be patient until you shall accomplish it

78
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:15,963
20 Behold, this is your work, to keep my

79
00:07:15,963 --> 00:07:21,963
 commandments, yea, with all your might, mind and strength

80
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:26,674
21 Seek not to declare my word, but first seek to

81
00:07:26,674 --> 00:07:31,874
 obtain my word, and then shall your tongue be

82
00:07:31,874 --> 00:07:37,074
 loosed; then, if you desire, you shall have my Spirit

83
00:07:37,074 --> 00:07:42,274
 and my word, yea, the power of God unto the

84
00:07:42,274 --> 00:07:47,474
 convincing of men

85
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:53,434
22 But now hold your peace; study my word which

86
00:07:53,434 --> 00:07:59,434
 hath gone forth among the children of men, and also

87
00:07:59,434 --> 00:08:05,434
 study my word which shall come forth among the

88
00:08:05,434 --> 00:08:11,434
 children of men, or that which is now translating,

89
00:08:11,434 --> 00:08:17,434
 yea, until you have obtained all which I shall grant

90
00:08:17,434 --> 00:08:23,434
 unto the children of men in this generation, and

91
00:08:23,434 --> 00:08:29,434
 then shall all things be added thereto

92
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:34,442
23 Behold thou art Hyrum, my son; seek the kingdom

93
00:08:34,442 --> 00:08:39,775
 of God, and all things shall be added according

94
00:08:39,775 --> 00:08:45,108
 to that which is just

95
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:52,925
24 Build upon my rock, which is my gospel

96
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:56,699
25 Deny not the spirit of revelation, nor the

97
00:08:56,699 --> 00:09:01,365
 spirit of prophecy, for wo unto him that denieth these

98
00:09:01,365 --> 00:09:06,033
 things

99
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:10,312
26 Therefore, treasure up in your heart until the

100
00:09:10,312 --> 00:09:14,312
 time which is in my wisdom that you shall go

101
00:09:14,312 --> 00:09:18,312
 forth

102
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:27,125
27 Behold, I speak unto all who have good desires,

103
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:35,625
 and have thrust in their sickle to reap

104
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:42,208
28 Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I am

105
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:49,208
 the life and the light of the world

106
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:54,222
29 I am the same who came unto mine own and mine

107
00:09:54,222 --> 00:09:59,222
 own received me not

108
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:05,249
30 But verily, verily, I say unto you, that as

109
00:10:05,249 --> 00:10:10,499
 many as receive me, to them will I give power to

110
00:10:10,499 --> 00:10:15,749
 become the sons of God, even to them that believe on

111
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:20,999
 my name. Amen.
