00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 11 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Prophet to his brother Hyrum Smith, at

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Harmony, Pennsylvania, May 1829. This revelation was

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
received through the Urim and Thummim in answer

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
to Joseph’s supplication and inquiry. Joseph

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Smith’s history suggests that this revelation was

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
received after the restoration of the Aaronic

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Priesthood. 
1–6, Laborers in the vineyard will

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
gain salvation; 
7–14, Seek wisdom, cry

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
repentance, trust in the Spirit; 
15–22, Keep the

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
commandments, and study the Lord’s word; 
23–27, Deny

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
not the spirit of revelation and of prophecy;

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:42:46,
28–30, Those who receive Christ become the sons of God. 

14
00:42:46,0 --> 00:42:46,0
1 A great and marvelous work is about

15
00:42:46,0 --> 00:43:58,
to come forth among the children of men.

16
00:43:58,0 --> 00:43:58,0
2 Behold, I am God; give heed to my

17
00:43:58,0 --> 00:43:58,0
word, which is quick and powerful,

18
00:43:58,0 --> 00:43:58,0
sharper than a two-edged sword, to the

19
00:43:58,0 --> 00:43:58,0
dividing asunder of both joints and

20
00:43:58,0 --> 00:49:27,
marrow; therefore give heed unto my word.

21
00:49:27,0 --> 00:49:27,0
3 Behold, the field is white

22
00:49:27,0 --> 00:49:27,0
already to harvest; therefore, whoso

23
00:49:27,0 --> 00:49:27,0
desireth to reap let him thrust in

24
00:49:27,0 --> 00:49:27,0
his sickle with his might, and reap

25
00:49:27,0 --> 00:49:27,0
while the day lasts, that he may

26
00:49:27,0 --> 00:49:27,0
treasure up for his soul

27
00:49:27,0 --> 00:55:38,
everlasting salvation in the kingdom of God.

28
00:55:38,0 --> 00:55:38,0
4 Yea, whosoever will

29
00:55:38,0 --> 00:55:38,0
thrust in his sickle and reap,

30
00:55:38,0 --> 01:04:48,
the same is called of God.

31
01:04:48,0 --> 01:04:48,0
5 Therefore, if you will

32
01:04:48,0 --> 01:04:48,0
ask of me you shall

33
01:04:48,0 --> 01:04:48,0
receive; if you will knock it

34
01:04:48,0 --> 01:11:56,
shall be opened unto you.

35
01:11:56,0 --> 01:11:56,0
6 Now, as you have

36
01:11:56,0 --> 01:11:56,0
asked, behold, I say

37
01:11:56,0 --> 01:11:56,0
unto you, keep my

38
01:11:56,0 --> 01:11:56,0
commandments, and seek to

39
01:11:56,0 --> 01:11:56,0
bring forth and

40
01:11:56,0 --> 01:21:06,
establish the cause of Zion.

41
01:21:06,0 --> 01:21:06,0
7 Seek not for

42
01:21:06,0 --> 01:21:06,0
riches but for wisdom;

43
01:21:06,0 --> 01:21:06,0
and, behold, the

44
01:21:06,0 --> 01:21:06,0
mysteries of God

45
01:21:06,0 --> 01:21:06,0
shall be unfolded unto

46
01:21:06,0 --> 01:21:06,0
you, and then shall

47
01:21:06,0 --> 01:21:06,0
you be made rich.

48
01:21:06,0 --> 01:21:06,0
Behold, he that

49
01:21:06,0 --> 01:23:48,
hath eternal life is rich.

50
01:23:48,0 --> 01:23:48,0
8 Verily, verily,

51
01:23:48,0 --> 01:23:48,0
I say unto you,

52
01:23:48,0 --> 01:23:48,0
even as you desire

53
01:23:48,0 --> 01:23:48,0
of me so it shall

54
01:23:48,0 --> 01:23:48,0
be done unto you;

55
01:23:48,0 --> 01:23:48,0
and, if you desire,

56
01:23:48,0 --> 01:23:48,0
you shall be the

57
01:23:48,0 --> 01:23:48,0
means of doing

58
01:23:48,0 --> 01:26:58,
much good in this generation.

59
01:26:58,0 --> 01:26:58,0
9 Say nothing

60
01:26:58,0 --> 01:26:58,0
but repentance

61
01:26:58,0 --> 01:26:58,0
unto this

62
01:26:58,0 --> 01:26:58,0
generation. Keep my

63
01:26:58,0 --> 01:26:58,0
commandments, and

64
01:26:58,0 --> 01:26:58,0
assist to bring

65
01:26:58,0 --> 01:26:58,0
forth my work,

66
01:26:58,0 --> 01:26:58,0
according to my

67
01:26:58,0 --> 01:26:58,0
commandments, and

68
01:26:58,0 --> 01:32:09,
you shall be blessed.

69
01:32:09,0 --> 01:32:09,0
10 Behold,

70
01:32:09,0 --> 01:32:09,0
thou hast a gift,

71
01:32:09,0 --> 01:32:09,0
or thou shalt

72
01:32:09,0 --> 01:32:09,0
have a gift

73
01:32:09,0 --> 01:32:09,0
if thou wilt

74

or in my power

81
01:32:09,0 --> 01:38:50,
which speaketh unto thee;

82
01:38:50,0 --> 01:38:50,0
11 For,
