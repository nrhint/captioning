00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:06,308
Section 11 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:06,308 --> 00:00:12,616
the Prophet to his brother Hyrum Smith, at

3
00:00:12,616 --> 00:00:18,924
Harmony, Pennsylvania, May 1829. This revelation was

4
00:00:18,924 --> 00:00:25,232
received through the Urim and Thummim in answer

5
00:00:25,232 --> 00:00:31,54
to Joseph’s supplication and inquiry. Joseph

6
00:00:31,54 --> 00:00:37,848
Smith’s history suggests that this revelation was

7
00:00:37,848 --> 00:00:44,156
received after the restoration of the Aaronic

8
00:00:44,156 --> 00:00:50,464
Priesthood. 
1–6, Laborers in the vineyard will

9
00:00:50,464 --> 00:00:56,772
gain salvation; 
7–14, Seek wisdom, cry

10
00:00:56,772 --> 00:01:03,08
repentance, trust in the Spirit; 
15–22, Keep the

11
00:01:03,08 --> 00:01:09,388
commandments, and study the Lord’s word; 
23–27, Deny

12
00:01:09,388 --> 00:01:15,696
not the spirit of revelation and of prophecy;

13
00:01:15,696 --> 00:01:22,149
28–30, Those who receive Christ become the sons of God. 

14
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:21,649
1 A great and marvelous work is about

15
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:21,214
to come forth among the children of men.

16
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:21,014
2 Behold, I am God; give heed to my

17
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:20,814
word, which is quick and powerful,

18
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:20,614
sharper than a two-edged sword, to the

19
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:20,414
dividing asunder of both joints and

20
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:20,28
marrow; therefore give heed unto my word.

21
00:01:20,28 --> 00:01:21,423
3 Behold, the field is white

22
00:01:21,423 --> 00:01:22,566
already to harvest; therefore, whoso

23
00:01:22,566 --> 00:01:23,709
desireth to reap let him thrust in

24
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:24,852
his sickle with his might, and reap

25
00:01:24,852 --> 00:01:25,995
while the day lasts, that he may

26
00:01:25,995 --> 00:01:27,138
treasure up for his soul

27
00:01:27,138 --> 00:01:28,722
everlasting salvation in the kingdom of God.

28
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:32,389
4 Yea, whosoever will

29
00:01:32,389 --> 00:01:36,056
thrust in his sickle and reap,

30
00:01:36,056 --> 00:01:39,099
the same is called of God.

31
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:47,849
5 Therefore, if you will

32
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:56,599
ask of me you shall

33
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:05,349
receive; if you will knock it

34
00:02:05,349 --> 00:02:14,001
shall be opened unto you.

35
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:18,668
6 Now, as you have

36
00:02:18,668 --> 00:02:23,335
asked, behold, I say

37
00:02:23,335 --> 00:02:28,002
unto you, keep my

38
00:02:28,002 --> 00:02:32,669
commandments, and seek to

39
00:02:32,669 --> 00:02:37,336
bring forth and

40
00:02:37,336 --> 00:02:42,329
establish the cause of Zion.

41
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,44
7 Seek not for

42
00:02:43,44 --> 00:02:44,551
riches but for wisdom;

43
00:02:44,551 --> 00:02:45,662
and, behold, the

44
00:02:45,662 --> 00:02:46,773
mysteries of God

45
00:02:46,773 --> 00:02:47,884
shall be unfolded unto

46
00:02:47,884 --> 00:02:48,995
you, and then shall

47
00:02:48,995 --> 00:02:50,106
you be made rich.

48
00:02:50,106 --> 00:02:51,217
Behold, he that

49
00:02:51,217 --> 00:02:52,706
hath eternal life is rich.

50
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:53,484
8 Verily, verily,

51
00:02:53,484 --> 00:02:54,262
I say unto you,

52
00:02:54,262 --> 00:02:55,04
even as you desire

53
00:02:55,04 --> 00:02:55,818
of me so it shall

54
00:02:55,818 --> 00:02:56,596
be done unto you;

55
00:02:56,596 --> 00:02:57,374
and, if you desire,

56
00:02:57,374 --> 00:02:58,152
you shall be the

57
00:02:58,152 --> 00:02:58,93
means of doing

58
00:02:58,93 --> 00:02:59,746
much good in this generation.

59
00:02:59,746 --> 00:02:59,646
9 Say nothing

60
00:02:59,646 --> 00:02:59,546
but repentance

61
00:02:59,546 --> 00:02:59,446
unto this

62
00:02:59,446 --> 00:02:59,346
generation. Keep my

63
00:02:59,346 --> 00:02:59,246
commandments, and

64
00:02:59,246 --> 00:02:59,146
assist to bring

65
00:02:59,146 --> 00:02:59,046
forth my work,

66
00:02:59,046 --> 00:02:58,946
according to my

67
00:02:58,946 --> 00:02:58,846
commandments, and

68
00:02:58,846 --> 00:02:58,812
you shall be blessed.

69
00:02:58,812 --> 00:02:58,735
10 Behold,

70
00:02:58,735 --> 00:02:58,658
thou hast a gift,

71
00:02:58,658 --> 00:02:58,581
or thou shalt

72
00:02:58,581 --> 00:02:58,504
have a gift

73
00:02:58,504 --> 00:02:58,427
if thou wilt

74
00:02:58,427 --> 00:02:58,35
desire of me in

75
00:02:58,35 --> 00:02:58,273
faith, with an

76
00:02:58,273 --> 00:02:58,196
honest heart,

77
00:02:58,196 --> 00:02:58,119
believing in

78
00:02:58,119 --> 00:02:58,042

79
00:02:58,042 --> 00:02:57,965
Jesus Christ,

80
00:02:57,965 --> 00:02:57,888
or in my power

81
00:02:57,888 --> 00:02:57,878
which speaketh unto thee;

82
00:02:57,878 --> 00:02:58,578
11 For,

83
00:02:58,578 --> 00:02:59,278
behold, it is I

84
00:02:59,278 --> 00:02:59,978

behold, I am the

86
00:03:00,678 --> 00:03:01,378
light which

87
00:03:01,378 --> 00:03:02,078
shineth in

88
00:03:02,078 --> 00:03:02,778
darkness, and

89
00:03:02,778 --> 00:03:03,478
by my power I

give these

91
00:03:04,178 --> 00:03:04,918
words unto thee.

92
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:06,132
12 And now,

93
00:03:06,132 --> 00:03:07,346

103
00:03:18,272 --> 00:03:19,486
humbly, to judge

104
00:03:19,486 --> 00:03:20,7

105
00:03:20,7 --> 00:03:21,334
and this is my Spirit.

106
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:23,501
13 Verily,

107
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:25,668
verily, I

108

Behold, I

138
00:04:05,33 --> 00:04:05,239
