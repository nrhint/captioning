00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:06,571
Section 3 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:06,571 --> 00:00:13,142
Prophet, at Harmony, Pennsylvania, July 1828,

3
00:00:13,142 --> 00:00:19,713
relating to the loss of 116 pages of manuscript

4
00:00:19,713 --> 00:00:26,284
translated from the first part of the Book of

5
00:00:26,284 --> 00:00:32,855
Mormon, which was called the book of Lehi. The

6
00:00:32,855 --> 00:00:39,426
Prophet had reluctantly allowed these pages to

7
00:00:39,426 --> 00:00:45,997
pass from his custody to that of Martin Harris,

8
00:00:45,997 --> 00:00:52,568
who had served for a brief period as scribe in

9
00:00:52,568 --> 00:00:59,139
the translation of the Book of Mormon. The

10
00:00:59,139 --> 00:01:05,71
revelation was given through the Urim and Thummim.

11
00:01:05,71 --> 00:01:12,281
(See 
section 10.) 
1–4, The Lord’s course is

12
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:18,852
one eternal round; 
5–15, Joseph Smith must

13
00:01:18,852 --> 00:01:25,423
repent or lose the gift to translate; 
16–20, The

14
00:01:25,423 --> 00:01:32,993
Book of Mormon comes forth to save the seed of Lehi. 

15
00:01:32,993 --> 00:01:31,66
1 The works, and the designs, and

16
00:01:31,66 --> 00:01:30,327
the purposes of God cannot be

17
00:01:30,327 --> 00:01:28,655
frustrated, neither can they come to naught.

18
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:29,369
2 For God doth not walk in

19
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:30,083
crooked paths, neither doth he turn

20
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:30,797
to the right hand nor to the

21
00:01:30,797 --> 00:01:31,511
left, neither doth he vary from

22
00:01:31,511 --> 00:01:32,225
that which he hath said,

23
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:32,939
therefore his paths are straight, and

24
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:33,744
his course is one eternal round.

25
00:01:33,744 --> 00:01:38,744
3 Remember, remember that it

26
00:01:38,744 --> 00:01:43,744
is not the work of God that is

27
00:01:43,744 --> 00:01:48,792
frustrated, but the work of men;

28
00:01:48,792 --> 00:01:51,892
4 For although a man may have

29
00:01:51,892 --> 00:01:54,992
many revelations, and have

30
00:01:54,992 --> 00:01:58,092
power to do many mighty works,

31
00:01:58,092 --> 00:02:01,192
yet if he boasts in his own

32
00:02:01,192 --> 00:02:04,292
strength, and sets at naught

33
00:02:04,292 --> 00:02:07,392
the counsels of God, and

34
00:02:07,392 --> 00:02:10,492
follows after the dictates of his

35
00:02:10,492 --> 00:02:13,592
own will and carnal desires,

36
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:16,692
he must fall and incur the

37
00:02:16,692 --> 00:02:19,823
vengeance of a just God upon him.

38
00:02:19,823 --> 00:02:21,966
5 Behold, you have been

39
00:02:21,966 --> 00:02:24,109
entrusted with these

40
00:02:24,109 --> 00:02:26,252
things, but how strict were

41
00:02:26,252 --> 00:02:28,395
your commandments; and

42
00:02:28,395 --> 00:02:30,538
remember also the promises

43
00:02:30,538 --> 00:02:32,681
which were made to you, if

44
00:02:32,681 --> 00:02:34,871
you did not transgress them.

45
00:02:34,871 --> 00:02:41,871
6 And behold, how oft you

46
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:48,871
have transgressed the

47
00:02:48,871 --> 00:02:55,871
commandments and the laws

48
00:02:55,871 --> 00:03:02,871
of God, and have gone on

49
00:03:02,871 --> 00:03:09,856
in the persuasions of men.

50
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,356
7 For, behold, you

51
00:03:11,356 --> 00:03:12,856
should not have feared

52
00:03:12,856 --> 00:03:14,356
man more than God.

53
00:03:14,356 --> 00:03:15,856
Although men set at

54
00:03:15,856 --> 00:03:17,356
naught the counsels of

55
00:03:17,356 --> 00:03:18,915
God, and despise his words—

56
00:03:18,915 --> 00:03:19,115
8 Yet you should

57
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:19,315
have been faithful;

58
00:03:19,315 --> 00:03:19,515
and he would have

59
00:03:19,515 --> 00:03:19,715
extended his arm and

60
00:03:19,715 --> 00:03:19,915
supported you

61
00:03:19,915 --> 00:03:20,115
against all the fiery

62
00:03:20,115 --> 00:03:20,315
darts of the

63
00:03:20,315 --> 00:03:20,515
adversary; and he would

64
00:03:20,515 --> 00:03:20,715
have been with you in

65
00:03:20,715 --> 00:03:20,984
every time of trouble.

66
00:03:20,984 --> 00:03:23,984
9 Behold, thou

67
00:03:23,984 --> 00:03:26,984
art Joseph, and

68
00:03:26,984 --> 00:03:29,984
thou wast chosen to

69
00:03:29,984 --> 00:03:32,984
do the work of

70
00:03:32,984 --> 00:03:35,984
the Lord, but

71
00:03:35,984 --> 00:03:38,984
because of

72
00:03:38,984 --> 00:03:41,984
transgression, if thou art

73
00:03:41,984 --> 00:03:44,024
not aware thou wilt fall.

74
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:44,107
10 But remember,

75
00:03:44,107 --> 00:03:44,19
God is

76
00:03:44,19 --> 00:03:44,273
merciful; therefore,

77
00:03:44,273 --> 00:03:44,356
repent of that

78
00:03:44,356 --> 00:03:44,439
which thou hast done

79
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:44,522
which is

80
00:03:44,522 --> 00:03:44,605
contrary to the

81
00:03:44,605 --> 00:03:44,688
commandment which I

82
00:03:44,688 --> 00:03:44,771
gave you, and thou

83
00:03:44,771 --> 00:03:44,854
art still

84
00:03:44,854 --> 00:03:44,937
chosen, and art again

85
00:03:44,937 --> 00:03:45,092
called to the work;

86
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:45,806
11 Except thou

87
00:03:45,806 --> 00:03:46,52
do this, thou

88
00:03:46,52 --> 00:03:47,234
shalt be

89
00:03:47,234 --> 00:03:47,948
delivered up and

90
00:03:47,948 --> 00:03:48,662
become as other

91
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:49,376
men, and have

92
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,163
no more gift.

93
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:50,913
12 And when

94
00:03:50,913 --> 00:03:51,663
thou

95
00:03:51,663 --> 00:03:52,413
deliveredst up that

96
00:03:52,413 --> 00:03:53,163
which God had

97
00:03:53,163 --> 00:03:53,913
given thee

98
00:03:53,913 --> 00:03:54,663
sight and power

99
00:03:54,663 --> 00:03:55,413
to translate,

100
00:03:55,413 --> 00:03:56,163
thou

101
00:03:56,163 --> 00:03:56,913
deliveredst up that

102
00:03:56,913 --> 00:03:57,663
which was

103
00:03:57,663 --> 00:03:58,413
sacred into the

104
00:03:58,413 --> 00:03:59,222
hands of a wicked man,

105
00:03:59,222 --> 00:03:59,422
13 Who has

106
00:03:59,422 --> 00:03:59,622
set at naught

107
00:03:59,622 --> 00:03:59,822
the

108
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:00,022
counsels of God,

109
00:04:00,022 --> 00:04:00,222
and has broken

110
00:04:00,222 --> 00:04:00,422
the most

111
00:04:00,422 --> 00:04:00,622
sacred

112
00:04:00,622 --> 00:04:00,822
promises which were

113
00:04:00,822 --> 00:04:01,022
made before

114
00:04:01,022 --> 00:04:01,222
God, and

115
00:04:01,222 --> 00:04:01,422
has depended

116
00:04:01,422 --> 00:04:01,622
upon his own

117
00:04:01,622 --> 00:04:01,822
judgment and

118
00:04:01,822 --> 00:04:02,022
boasted in

119
00:04:02,022 --> 00:04:02,876
his own wisdom.

120
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:05,876
14 And

121
00:04:05,876 --> 00:04:08,876
this is the

122
00:04:08,876 --> 00:04:11,876
reason that

123
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:14,876
thou hast

124
00:04:14,876 --> 00:04:17,876
lost thy

125
00:04:17,876 --> 00:04:20,876
privileges

126
00:04:20,876 --> 00:04:23,947
for a season—

127
00:04:23,947 --> 00:04:24,747
15 For

128
00:04:24,747 --> 00:04:25,547
thou hast

129
00:04:25,547 --> 00:04:26,347
suffered

130
00:04:26,347 --> 00:04:27,147
the

131
00:04:27,147 --> 00:04:27,947
counsel of thy

132
00:04:27,947 --> 00:04:28,747
director

133
00:04:28,747 --> 00:04:29,547
to be

134
00:04:29,547 --> 00:04:30,347
trampled

135
00:04:30,347 --> 00:04:31,147
upon from

136
00:04:31,147 --> 00:04:31,004
the beginning.

137
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,091
16

138
00:04:32,091 --> 00:04:33,178
Nevertheless,

139
00:04:33,178 --> 00:04:34,265
my work

140
00:04:34,265 --> 00:04:35,352
shall

141
00:04:35,352 --> 00:04:36,439
go forth,

142
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:37,526
for

143
00:04:37,526 --> 00:04:38,613
inasmuch as

144
00:04:38,613 --> 00:04:39,7
the

145
00:04:39,7 --> 00:04:40,787
knowledge

146
00:04:40,787 --> 00:04:41,874
of a

147
00:04:41,874 --> 00:04:42,961
Savior has

148
00:04:42,961 --> 00:04:44,048
come unto

149
00:04:44,048 --> 00:04:45,135
the

150
00:04:45,135 --> 00:04:46,222
world,

151
00:04:46,222 --> 00:04:47,309
through the

152
00:04:47,309 --> 00:04:48,396


153
00:04:48,396 --> 00:04:49,483
testimony of the

154
00:04:49,483 --> 00:04:50,57
Jews,

155
00:04:50,57 --> 00:04:51,657
even so

156
00:04:51,657 --> 00:04:52,744
shall the

157
00:04:52,744 --> 00:04:53,831


158
00:04:53,831 --> 00:04:54,918
knowledge of a

159
00:04:54,918 --> 00:04:56,046
Savior come unto my people—

160
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:56,546
17 And

161
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,046
to the

162
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:57,546


163
00:04:57,546 --> 00:04:58,046
Nephites, and

164
00:04:58,046 --> 00:04:58,546
the

165
00:04:58,546 --> 00:04:59,046
Jacobites,

166
00:04:59,046 --> 00:04:59,546
and

167
00:04:59,546 --> 00:05:00,046
the

168
00:05:00,046 --> 00:05:00,546
Josephites,

169
00:05:00,546 --> 00:05:01,046
and the

170
00:05:01,046 --> 00:05:01,546


171
00:05:01,546 --> 00:05:02,046
Zoramites,

172
00:05:02,046 --> 00:05:02,546
through

173
00:05:02,546 --> 00:05:03,046
the

174
00:05:03,046 --> 00:05:03,546
testimony

175
00:05:03,546 --> 00:05:04,12
of their fathers—

176
00:05:04,12 --> 00:05:04,477
18 And

177
00:05:04,477 --> 00:05:04,834
this

178
00:05:04,834 --> 00:05:05,191
testimony

179
00:05:05,191 --> 00:05:05,548
shall

180
00:05:05,548 --> 00:05:05,905
come to

181
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:06,262
the

182
00:05:06,262 --> 00:05:06,619
knowledge

183
00:05:06,619 --> 00:05:06,976
of the

184
00:05:06,976 --> 00:05:07,333


185
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:07,69
Lamanites,

186
00:05:07,69 --> 00:05:08,047
and the

187
00:05:08,047 --> 00:05:08,404


188
00:05:08,404 --> 00:05:08,761
Lemuelites, and

189
00:05:08,761 --> 00:05:09,118
the

190
00:05:09,118 --> 00:05:09,475


191
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:09,832
Ishmaelites, who

192
00:05:09,832 --> 00:05:10,189


193
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:10,546
dwindled in

194
00:05:10,546 --> 00:05:10,903
unbelief

195
00:05:10,903 --> 00:05:11,26


196
00:05:11,26 --> 00:05:11,617
because of

197
00:05:11,617 --> 00:05:11,974
the

198
00:05:11,974 --> 00:05:12,331
iniquity of

199
00:05:12,331 --> 00:05:12,688
their

200
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:13,045
fathers,

201
00:05:13,045 --> 00:05:13,402
whom

202
00:05:13,402 --> 00:05:13,759
the Lord

203
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,116
