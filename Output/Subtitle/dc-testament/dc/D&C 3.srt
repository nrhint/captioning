1
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:18,195
Section 3 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet, at 

2
00:00:18,195 --> 00:00:25,112
Harmony, Pennsylvania, July 1828, relating to the loss of 116 

3
00:00:25,112 --> 00:00:32,029
pages of manuscript translated from the first part of the 

4
00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:38,946
Book of Mormon, which was called the book of Lehi. 

5
00:00:38,946 --> 00:00:45,863
The Prophet had reluctantly allowed these pages to pass from 

6
00:00:45,863 --> 00:00:52,78
his custody to that of Martin Harris, who had served 

7
00:00:52,78 --> 00:00:59,697
for a brief period as scribe in the translation of 

8
00:00:59,697 --> 00:01:06,614
the Book of Mormon. The revelation was given through the 

9
00:01:06,614 --> 00:01:13,531
Urim and Thummim. (See 
section 10.) 
1–4, The Lord’s course is 

10
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:20,448
one eternal round; 
5–15, Joseph Smith must repent or lose 

11
00:01:20,448 --> 00:01:27,365
the gift to translate; 
16–20, The Book of Mormon comes 

12
00:01:27,365 --> 00:01:34,194
forth to save the seed of Lehi.  

13
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:41,694
1 The works, and the designs, and the purposes of 

14
00:01:41,694 --> 00:01:49,543
God cannot be frustrated, neither can they come to naught. 

15
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:55,943
2 For God doth not walk in crooked paths, neither 

16
00:01:55,943 --> 00:02:02,343
doth he turn to the right hand nor to the 

17
00:02:02,343 --> 00:02:08,743
left, neither doth he vary from that which he hath 

18
00:02:08,743 --> 00:02:15,143
said, therefore his paths are straight, and his course is 

19
00:02:15,143 --> 00:02:21,024
one eternal round. 

20
00:02:21,024 --> 00:02:28,024
3 Remember, remember that it is not the work of 

21
00:02:28,024 --> 00:02:35,539
God that is frustrated, but the work of men; 

22
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:43,206
4 For although a man may have many revelations, and 

23
00:02:43,206 --> 00:02:50,873
have power to do many mighty works, yet if he 

24
00:02:50,873 --> 00:02:58,54
boasts in his own strength, and sets at naught the 

25
00:02:58,54 --> 00:03:06,207
counsels of God, and follows after the dictates of his 

26
00:03:06,207 --> 00:03:13,874
own will and carnal desires, he must fall and incur 

27
00:03:13,874 --> 00:03:21,501
the vengeance of a just God upon him. 

28
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:27,751
5 Behold, you have been entrusted with these things, but 

29
00:03:27,751 --> 00:03:34,001
how strict were your commandments; and remember also the promises 

30
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:40,251
which were made to you, if you did not transgress 

31
00:03:40,251 --> 00:03:46,126
them. 

32
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:51,793
6 And behold, how oft you have transgressed the commandments 

33
00:03:51,793 --> 00:03:57,46
and the laws of God, and have gone on in 

34
00:03:57,46 --> 00:04:03,176
the persuasions of men. 

35
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:10,176
7 For, behold, you should not have feared man more 

36
00:04:10,176 --> 00:04:17,176
than God. Although men set at naught the counsels of 

37
00:04:17,176 --> 00:04:24,681
God, and despise his words— 

38
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:32,931
8 Yet you should have been faithful; and he would 

39
00:04:32,931 --> 00:04:41,181
have extended his arm and supported you against all the 

40
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:49,431
fiery darts of the adversary; and he would have been 

41
00:04:49,431 --> 00:04:57,214
with you in every time of trouble. 

42
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:04,881
9 Behold, thou art Joseph, and thou wast chosen to 

43
00:05:04,881 --> 00:05:12,548
do the work of the Lord, but because of transgression, 

44
00:05:12,548 --> 00:05:20,287
if thou art not aware thou wilt fall. 

45
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:26,537
10 But remember, God is merciful; therefore, repent of that 

46
00:05:26,537 --> 00:05:32,787
which thou hast done which is contrary to the commandment 

47
00:05:32,787 --> 00:05:39,037
which I gave you, and thou art still chosen, and 

48
00:05:39,037 --> 00:05:45,812
art again called to the work; 

49
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:54,312
11 Except thou do this, thou shalt be delivered up 

50
00:05:54,312 --> 00:06:02,596
and become as other men, and have no more gift. 

51
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:08,346
12 And when thou deliveredst up that which God had 

52
00:06:08,346 --> 00:06:14,096
given thee sight and power to translate, thou deliveredst up 

53
00:06:14,096 --> 00:06:19,846
that which was sacred into the hands of a wicked 

54
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:25,852
man, 

55
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:33,102
13 Who has set at naught the counsels of God, 

56
00:06:33,102 --> 00:06:40,352
and has broken the most sacred promises which were made 

57
00:06:40,352 --> 00:06:47,602
before God, and has depended upon his own judgment and 

58
00:06:47,602 --> 00:06:54,614
boasted in his own wisdom. 

59
00:06:54,614 --> 00:07:00,614
14 And this is the reason that thou hast lost 

60
00:07:00,614 --> 00:07:06,927
thy privileges for a season— 

61
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:15,927
15 For thou hast suffered the counsel of thy director 

62
00:07:15,927 --> 00:07:24,444
to be trampled upon from the beginning. 

63
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:31,444
16 Nevertheless, my work shall go forth, for inasmuch as 

64
00:07:31,444 --> 00:07:38,444
the knowledge of a Savior has come unto the world, 

65
00:07:38,444 --> 00:07:45,444
through the testimony of the Jews, even so shall the 

66
00:07:45,444 --> 00:07:52,439
knowledge of a Savior come unto my people— 

67
00:07:52,439 --> 00:08:00,939
17 And to the Nephites, and the Jacobites, and the 

68
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:09,456
Josephites, and the Zoramites, through the testimony of their fathers— 

69
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:17,856
18 And this testimony shall come to the knowledge of 

70
00:08:17,856 --> 00:08:26,256
the Lamanites, and the Lemuelites, and the Ishmaelites, who dwindled 

71
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:34,656
in unbelief because of the iniquity of their fathers, whom 

72
00:08:34,656 --> 00:08:43,056
the Lord has suffered to destroy their brethren the Nephites, 

73
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:51,431
because of their iniquities and their abominations. 

74
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:58,764
19 And for this very purpose are these plates preserved, 

75
00:08:58,764 --> 00:09:06,097
which contain these records—that the promises of the Lord might 

76
00:09:06,097 --> 00:09:13,703
be fulfilled, which he made to his people; 

77
00:09:13,703 --> 00:09:14,37
20 And that the Lamanites might come to the knowledge 

78
00:09:14,37 --> 00:09:15,037
of their fathers, and that they might know the promises 

79
00:09:15,037 --> 00:09:15,704
of the Lord, and that they may believe the gospel 

80
00:09:15,704 --> 00:09:16,371
and rely upon the merits of Jesus Christ, and be 

81
00:09:16,371 --> 00:09:17,038
glorified through faith in his name, and that through their 

82
00:09:17,038 --> 00:09:17,24
repentance they might be saved. Amen.
