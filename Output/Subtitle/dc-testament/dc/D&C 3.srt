section 10.) 
1–4, The Lord’s course is one eternal round; 
5–15, 

2
00:00:32,261 --> 00:00:53,011
Joseph Smith must repent or lose the gift to translate;

00:00:53,011 --> 00:01:13,761

16–20, The Book of Mormon comes forth to save the 

4
00:01:13,761 --> 00:01:34,511
seed of Lehi.  

5
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:42,428
1 The works, and the designs, and the purposes of 

6
00:01:42,428 --> 00:01:50,428
God cannot be frustrated, neither can they come to naught. 

7
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:56,677
2 For God doth not walk in crooked paths, neither 

8
00:01:56,677 --> 00:02:02,877
doth he turn to the right hand nor to the 

9
00:02:02,877 --> 00:02:09,077
left, neither doth he vary from that which he hath 

10
00:02:09,077 --> 00:02:15,277
said, therefore his paths are straight, and his course is 

11
00:02:15,277 --> 00:02:21,477
one eternal round. 

12
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:28,558
3 Remember, remember that it is not the work of 

13
00:02:28,558 --> 00:02:35,558
God that is frustrated, but the work of men; 

14
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:43,222
4 For although a man may have many revelations, and 

15
00:02:43,222 --> 00:02:50,889
have power to do many mighty works, yet if he 

16
00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:58,555
boasts in his own strength, and sets at naught the 

17
00:02:58,555 --> 00:03:06,222
counsels of God, and follows after the dictates of his 

18
00:03:06,222 --> 00:03:13,889
own will and carnal desires, he must fall and incur 

19
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:21,555
the vengeance of a just God upon him. 

20
00:03:21,518 --> 00:03:27,768
5 Behold, you have been entrusted with these things, but 

21
00:03:27,768 --> 00:03:34,018
how strict were your commandments; and remember also the promises 

22
00:03:34,018 --> 00:03:40,268
which were made to you, if you did not transgress 

23
00:03:40,268 --> 00:03:46,518
them. 

24
00:03:46,576 --> 00:03:52,243
6 And behold, how oft you have transgressed the commandments 

25
00:03:52,243 --> 00:03:57,91
and the laws of God, and have gone on in 

26
00:03:57,91 --> 00:04:03,576
the persuasions of men. 

27
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:10,176
7 For, behold, you should not have feared man more 

28
00:04:10,176 --> 00:04:17,176
than God. Although men set at naught the counsels of 

29
00:04:17,176 --> 00:04:24,176
God, and despise his words— 

30
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:32,931
8 Yet you should have been faithful; and he would 

31
00:04:32,931 --> 00:04:41,181
have extended his arm and supported you against all the 

32
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:49,431
fiery darts of the adversary; and he would have been 

33
00:04:49,431 --> 00:04:57,681
with you in every time of trouble. 

34
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:04,88
9 Behold, thou art Joseph, and thou wast chosen to 

35
00:05:04,88 --> 00:05:12,547
do the work of the Lord, but because of transgression, 

36
00:05:12,547 --> 00:05:20,214
if thou art not aware thou wilt fall. 

37
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:26,787
10 But remember, God is merciful; therefore, repent of that 

38
00:05:26,787 --> 00:05:33,287
which thou hast done which is contrary to the commandment 

39
00:05:33,287 --> 00:05:39,787
which I gave you, and thou art still chosen, and 

40
00:05:39,787 --> 00:05:46,287
art again called to the work; 

41
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:54,279
11 Except thou do this, thou shalt be delivered up 

42
00:05:54,279 --> 00:06:02,279
and become as other men, and have no more gift. 

43
00:06:02,812 --> 00:06:08,562
12 And when thou deliveredst up that which God had 

44
00:06:08,562 --> 00:06:14,312
given thee sight and power to translate, thou deliveredst up 

45
00:06:14,312 --> 00:06:20,062
that which was sacred into the hands of a wicked 

46
00:06:20,062 --> 00:06:25,812
man, 

47
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:33,069
13 Who has set at naught the counsels of God, 

48
00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:40,319
and has broken the most sacred promises which were made 

49
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:47,569
before God, and has depended upon his own judgment and 

50
00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:54,819
boasted in his own wisdom. 

51
00:06:54,814 --> 00:07:00,814
14 And this is the reason that thou hast lost 

52
00:07:00,814 --> 00:07:06,814
thy privileges for a season— 

53
00:07:06,81 --> 00:07:15,81
15 For thou hast suffered the counsel of thy director 

54
00:07:15,81 --> 00:07:24,81
to be trampled upon from the beginning. 

55
00:07:24,327 --> 00:07:31,327
16 Nevertheless, my work shall go forth, for inasmuch as 

56
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:38,327
the knowledge of a Savior has come unto the world, 

57
00:07:38,327 --> 00:07:45,327
through the testimony of the Jews, even so shall the 

58
00:07:45,327 --> 00:07:52,327
knowledge of a Savior come unto my people— 

59
00:07:52,339 --> 00:08:00,839
17 And to the Nephites, and the Jacobites, and the 

60
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:09,339
Josephites, and the Zoramites, through the testimony of their fathers— 

61
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:17,756
18 And this testimony shall come to the knowledge of 

62
00:08:17,756 --> 00:08:26,156
the Lamanites, and the Lemuelites, and the Ishmaelites, who dwindled 

63
00:08:26,156 --> 00:08:34,556
in unbelief because of the iniquity of their fathers, whom 

64
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:42,956
the Lord has suffered to destroy their brethren the Nephites, 

65
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:51,356
because of their iniquities and their abominations. 

66
00:08:51,848 --> 00:08:59,181
19 And for this very purpose are these plates preserved, 

67
00:08:59,181 --> 00:09:06,515
which contain these records—that the promises of the Lord might 

68
00:09:06,515 --> 00:09:13,848
be fulfilled, which he made to his people; 

69
00:00:11,511 --> 00:01:16,511
Section 3 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet, at 

70
00:01:16,511 --> 00:02:21,512
Harmony, Pennsylvania, July 1828, relating to the loss of 116 

71
00:02:21,512 --> 00:03:26,512
pages of manuscript translated from the first part of the 

72
00:03:26,512 --> 00:04:31,512
Book of Mormon, which was called the book of Lehi. 

73
00:04:31,512 --> 00:05:36,512
The Prophet had reluctantly allowed these pages to pass from 

74
00:05:36,512 --> 00:06:41,512
his custody to that of Martin Harris, who had served 

75
00:06:41,512 --> 00:07:46,512
for a brief period as scribe in the translation of 

76
00:07:46,512 --> 00:08:51,511
the Book of Mormon. The revelation was given through the 

77
00:08:51,511 --> 00:09:56,511
Urim and Thummim. (See
