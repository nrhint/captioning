1
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:17,207
Section 3 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:17,207 --> 00:00:23,136
 Prophet, at Harmony, Pennsylvania, July 1828,

3
00:00:23,136 --> 00:00:29,065
 relating to the loss of 116 pages of manuscript

4
00:00:29,065 --> 00:00:34,994
 translated from the first part of the Book of Mormon, which

5
00:00:34,994 --> 00:00:40,923
 was called the book of Lehi. The Prophet had

6
00:00:40,923 --> 00:00:46,852
 reluctantly allowed these pages to pass from his

7
00:00:46,852 --> 00:00:52,781
 custody to that of Martin Harris, who had served for a

8
00:00:52,781 --> 00:00:58,71
 brief period as scribe in the translation of the

9
00:00:58,71 --> 00:01:04,639
 Book of Mormon. The revelation was given through

10
00:01:04,639 --> 00:01:10,568
 the Urim and Thummim. (See 
section 10.) 
1–4, The

11
00:01:10,568 --> 00:01:16,497
 Lord’s course is one eternal round; 
5–15, Joseph

12
00:01:16,497 --> 00:01:22,426
 Smith must repent or lose the gift to translate;

13
00:01:22,426 --> 00:01:28,355
16–20, The Book of Mormon comes forth to save the

14
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:34,284
 seed of Lehi.

15
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:39,194
1 The works, and the designs, and the purposes of

16
00:01:39,194 --> 00:01:44,194
 God cannot be frustrated, neither can they come to

17
00:01:44,194 --> 00:01:49,194
 naught

18
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:55,943
2 For God doth not walk in crooked paths, neither

19
00:01:55,943 --> 00:02:02,343
 doth he turn to the right hand nor to the left,

20
00:02:02,343 --> 00:02:08,743
 neither doth he vary from that which he hath said,

21
00:02:08,743 --> 00:02:15,143
 therefore his paths are straight, and his course is

22
00:02:15,143 --> 00:02:21,543
 one eternal round

23
00:02:21,024 --> 00:02:28,024
3 Remember, remember that it is not the work of

24
00:02:28,024 --> 00:02:35,024
 God that is frustrated, but the work of men

25
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:43,206
4 For although a man may have many revelations,

26
00:02:43,206 --> 00:02:50,873
 and have power to do many mighty works, yet if he

27
00:02:50,873 --> 00:02:58,54
 boasts in his own strength, and sets at naught the

28
00:02:58,54 --> 00:03:06,207
 counsels of God, and follows after the dictates of

29
00:03:06,207 --> 00:03:13,874
 his own will and carnal desires, he must fall and

30
00:03:13,874 --> 00:03:21,541
 incur the vengeance of a just God upon him

31
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:27,751
5 Behold, you have been entrusted with these

32
00:03:27,751 --> 00:03:34,001
 things, but how strict were your commandments; and

33
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:40,251
 remember also the promises which were made to you, if

34
00:03:40,251 --> 00:03:46,501
 you did not transgress them

35
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:51,793
6 And behold, how oft you have transgressed the

36
00:03:51,793 --> 00:03:57,46
 commandments and the laws of God, and have gone on

37
00:03:57,46 --> 00:04:03,127
 in the persuasions of men

38
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:10,176
7 For, behold, you should not have feared man more

39
00:04:10,176 --> 00:04:17,176
 than God. Although men set at naught the counsels

40
00:04:17,176 --> 00:04:24,176
 of God, and despise his words

41
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:32,931
8 Yet you should have been faithful; and he would

42
00:04:32,931 --> 00:04:41,181
 have extended his arm and supported you against

43
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:49,431
 all the fiery darts of the adversary; and he would

44
00:04:49,431 --> 00:04:57,681
 have been with you in every time of trouble

45
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:04,881
9 Behold, thou art Joseph, and thou wast chosen to

46
00:05:04,881 --> 00:05:12,548
 do the work of the Lord, but because of

47
00:05:12,548 --> 00:05:20,215
 transgression, if thou art not aware thou wilt fall

48
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:26,537
10 But remember, God is merciful; therefore,

49
00:05:26,537 --> 00:05:32,787
 repent of that which thou hast done which is contrary

50
00:05:32,787 --> 00:05:39,037
 to the commandment which I gave you, and thou art

51
00:05:39,037 --> 00:05:45,287
 still chosen, and art again called to the work

52
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:54,312
11 Except thou do this, thou shalt be delivered up

53
00:05:54,312 --> 00:06:02,812
 and become as other men, and have no more gift

54
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:08,346
12 And when thou deliveredst up that which God had

55
00:06:08,346 --> 00:06:14,096
 given thee sight and power to translate, thou

56
00:06:14,096 --> 00:06:19,846
 deliveredst up that which was sacred into the hands

57
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:25,596
 of a wicked man

58
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:33,102
13 Who has set at naught the counsels of God, and

59
00:06:33,102 --> 00:06:40,352
 has broken the most sacred promises which were

60
00:06:40,352 --> 00:06:47,602
 made before God, and has depended upon his own

61
00:06:47,602 --> 00:06:54,852
 judgment and boasted in his own wisdom

62
00:06:54,614 --> 00:07:00,614
14 And this is the reason that thou hast lost thy

63
00:07:00,614 --> 00:07:06,614
 privileges for a season

64
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:15,927
15 For thou hast suffered the counsel of thy

65
00:07:15,927 --> 00:07:24,927
 director to be trampled upon from the beginning

66
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:30,044
16 Nevertheless, my work shall go forth, for

67
00:07:30,044 --> 00:07:35,644
 inasmuch as the knowledge of a Savior has come unto the

68
00:07:35,644 --> 00:07:41,244
 world, through the testimony of the Jews, even so

69
00:07:41,244 --> 00:07:46,844
 shall the knowledge of a Savior come unto my

70
00:07:46,844 --> 00:07:52,444
 people

71
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:58,106
17 And to the Nephites, and the Jacobites, and the

72
00:07:58,106 --> 00:08:03,773
 Josephites, and the Zoramites, through the

73
00:08:03,773 --> 00:08:09,44
 testimony of their fathers

74
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:16,456
18 And this testimony shall come to the knowledge

75
00:08:16,456 --> 00:08:23,456
 of the Lamanites, and the Lemuelites, and the

76
00:08:23,456 --> 00:08:30,456
 Ishmaelites, who dwindled in unbelief because of the

77
00:08:30,456 --> 00:08:37,456
 iniquity of their fathers, whom the Lord has

78
00:08:37,456 --> 00:08:44,456
 suffered to destroy their brethren the Nephites, because

79
00:08:44,456 --> 00:08:51,456
 of their iniquities and their abominations

80
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:56,931
19 And for this very purpose are these plates

81
00:08:56,931 --> 00:09:02,431
 preserved, which contain these records—that the

82
00:09:02,431 --> 00:09:07,931
 promises of the Lord might be fulfilled, which he made

83
00:09:07,931 --> 00:09:13,431
 to his people

84
00:09:13,703 --> 00:09:14,274
20 And that the Lamanites might come to the

85
00:09:14,274 --> 00:09:14,845
 knowledge of their fathers, and that they might know the

86
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:15,416
 promises of the Lord, and that they may believe

87
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:15,987
 the gospel and rely upon the merits of Jesus

88
00:09:15,987 --> 00:09:16,558
 Christ, and be glorified through faith in his name, and

89
00:09:16,558 --> 00:09:17,129
 that through their repentance they might be saved.

90
00:09:17,129 --> 00:09:17,7
 Amen.
