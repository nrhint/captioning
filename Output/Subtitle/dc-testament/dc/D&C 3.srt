1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 3 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Prophet, at Harmony, Pennsylvania, July 1828,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
relating to the loss of 116 pages of manuscript

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
translated from the first part of the Book of

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Mormon, which was called the book of Lehi. The

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Prophet had reluctantly allowed these pages to

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
pass from his custody to that of Martin Harris,

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
who had served for a brief period as scribe in

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the translation of the Book of Mormon. The

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
revelation was given through the Urim and Thummim.

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
(See 
section 10.) 
1–4, The Lord’s course is

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
one eternal round; 
5–15, Joseph Smith must

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
repent or lose the gift to translate; 
16–20, The

14
00:00:00,0 --> 01:32:54,
Book of Mormon comes forth to save the seed of Lehi. 

15
01:32:54,0 --> 01:32:54,0
1 The works, and the designs, and

16
01:32:54,0 --> 01:32:54,0
the purposes of God cannot be

17
01:32:54,0 --> 01:28:34,
frustrated, neither can they come to naught.

18
01:28:34,0 --> 01:28:34,0
2 For God doth not walk in

19
01:28:34,0 --> 01:28:34,0
crooked paths, neither doth he turn

20
01:28:34,0 --> 01:28:34,0
to the right hand nor to the

21
01:28:34,0 --> 01:28:34,0
left, neither doth he vary from

22
01:28:34,0 --> 01:28:34,0
that which he hath said,

23
01:28:34,0 --> 01:28:34,0
therefore his paths are straight, and

24
01:28:34,0 --> 01:33:39,
his course is one eternal round.

25
01:33:39,0 --> 01:33:39,0
3 Remember, remember that it

26
01:33:39,0 --> 01:33:39,0
is not the work of God that is

27
01:33:39,0 --> 01:48:41,
frustrated, but the work of men;

28
01:48:41,0 --> 01:48:41,0
4 For although a man may have

29
01:48:41,0 --> 01:48:41,0
many revelations, and have

30
01:48:41,0 --> 01:48:41,0
power to do many mighty works,

31
01:48:41,0 --> 01:48:41,0
yet if he boasts in his own

32
01:48:41,0 --> 01:48:41,0
strength, and sets at naught

33
01:48:41,0 --> 01:48:41,0
the counsels of God, and

34
01:48:41,0 --> 01:48:41,0
follows after the dictates of his

35
01:48:41,0 --> 01:48:41,0
own will and carnal desires,

36
01:48:41,0 --> 01:48:41,0
he must fall and incur the

37
01:48:41,0 --> 02:19:41,
vengeance of a just God upon him.

38
02:19:41,0 --> 02:19:41,0
5 Behold, you have been

39
02:19:41,0 --> 02:19:41,0
entrusted with these

40
02:19:41,0 --> 02:19:41,0
things, but how strict were

41
02:19:41,0 --> 02:19:41,0
your commandments; and

42
02:19:41,0 --> 02:19:41,0
remember also the promises

43
02:19:41,0 --> 02:19:41,0
which were made to you, if

44
02:19:41,0 --> 02:34:43,
you did not transgress them.

45
02:34:43,0 --> 02:34:43,0
6 And behold, how oft you

46
02:34:43,0 --> 02:34:43,0
have transgressed the

47
02:34:43,0 --> 02:34:43,0
commandments and the laws

48
02:34:43,0 --> 02:34:43,0
of God, and have gone on

49
02:34:43,0 --> 03:19:43,
in the persuasions of men.

50
03:19:43,0 --> 03:19:43,0
7 For, behold, you

51
03:19:43,0 --> 03:19:43,0
should not have feared

52
03:19:43,0 --> 03:19:43,0
man more than God.

53
03:19:43,0 --> 03:19:43,0
Although men set at

54
03:19:43,0 --> 03:19:43,0
naught the counsels of

55
03:19:43,0 --> 03:44:44,
God, and despise his words—

56
03:44:44,0 --> 03:44:44,0
8 Yet you should

57
03:44:44,0 --> 03:44:44,0
have been faithful;

58
03:44:44,0 --> 03:44:44,0
and he would have

59
03:44:44,0 --> 03:44:44,0
extended his arm and

60
03:44:44,0 --> 03:44:44,0
supported you

61
03:44:44,0 --> 03:44:44,0
against all the fiery

62
03:44:44,0 --> 03:44:44,0
darts of the

63
03:44:44,0 --> 03:44:44,0
adversary; and he would

64
03:44:44,0 --> 03:44:44,0
have been with you in

65
03:44:44,0 --> 04:01:46,
every time of trouble.

66
04:01:46,0 --> 04:01:46,0
9 Behold, thou

67
04:01:46,0 --> 04:01:46,0
art Joseph, and

68
04:01:46,0 --> 04:01:46,0
thou wast chosen to

69
04:01:46,0 --> 04:01:46,0
do the work of

70
04:01:46,0 --> 04:01:46,0
the Lord, but

71
04:01:46,0 --> 04:01:46,0
because of

72
04:01:46,0 --> 04:01:46,0
transgression, if thou art

73
04:01:46,0 --> 04:12:46,
not aware thou wilt fall.

74
04:12:46,0 --> 04:12:46,0
10 But remember,

75
04:12:46,0 --> 04:12:46,0
God is

76
04:12:46,0 --> 04:12:46,0
merciful; therefore,

77
04:12:46,0 --> 04:12:46,0
repent of that

78
04:12:46,0 --> 04:12:46,0
which thou hast done

79
04:12:46,0 --> 04:12:46,0
which is

80
04:12:46,0 --> 04:12:46,0
contrary to the

81
04:12:46,0 --> 04:12:46,0
commandment which I

82
04:12:46,0 --> 04:12:46,0
gave you, and thou

83
04:12:46,0 --> 04:12:46,0
art still

84
04:12:46,0 --> 04:12:46,0
chosen, and art again

85
04:12:46,0 --> 04:24:24,
called to the work;

86
04:24:24,0 --> 04:24:24,0
11 Except thou

87
04:24:24,0 --> 04:24:24,0
do this, thou

88
04:24:24,0 --> 04:24:24,0
shalt be

89
04:24:24,0 --> 04:24:24,0
delivered up and

90
04:24:24,0 --> 04:24:24,0
become as other

91
04:24:24,0 --> 04:24:24,0
men, and have

92
04:24:24,0 --> 04:55:24,
no more gift.

93
04:55:24,0 --> 04:55:24,0
12 And when

94
04:55:24,0 --> 04:55:24,0
thou

95
04:55:24,0 --> 04:55:24,0
deliveredst up that

96
04:55:24,0 --> 04:55:24,0
which God had

97
04:55:24,0 --> 04:55:24,0
given thee

98
04:55:24,0 --> 04:55:24,0
sight and power

99
04:55:24,0 --> 04:55:24,0
to translate,

100
04:55:24,0 --> 04:55:24,0
thou

101
04:55:24,0 --> 04:55:24,0
deliveredst up that

102
04:55:24,0 --> 04:55:24,0
which was

103
04:55:24,0 --> 04:55:24,0
sacred into the

104
04:55:24,0 --> 05:14:23,
hands of a wicked man,

105
05:14:23,0 --> 05:14:23,0
13 Who has

106
05:14:23,0 --> 05:14:23,0
set at naught

107
05:14:23,0 --> 05:14:23,0
the

108
05:14:23,0 --> 05:14:23,0
counsels of God,

109
05:14:23,0 --> 05:14:23,0
and has broken

110
05:14:23,0 --> 05:14:23,0
the most

111
05:14:23,0 --> 05:14:23,0
sacred

112
05:14:23,0 --> 05:14:23,0
promises which were

113
05:14:23,0 --> 05:14:23,0
made before

114
05:14:23,0 --> 05:14:23,0
God, and

115
05:14:23,0 --> 05:14:23,0
has depended

116
05:14:23,0 --> 05:14:23,0
upon his own

117
05:14:23,0 --> 05:14:23,0
judgment and

118
05:14:23,0 --> 05:14:23,0
boasted in

119
05:14:23,0 --> 05:19:28,
his own wisdom.

120
05:19:28,0 --> 05:19:28,0
14 And

121
05:19:28,0 --> 05:19:28,0
this is the

122
05:19:28,0 --> 05:19:28,0
reason that

123
05:19:28,0 --> 05:19:28,0
thou hast

124
05:19:28,0 --> 05:19:28,0
lost thy

125
05:19:28,0 --> 05:19:28,0
privileges

126
05:19:28,0 --> 05:44:29,
for a season—

127
05:44:29,0 --> 05:44:29,0
15 For

128
05:44:29,0 --> 05:44:29,0
thou hast

129
05:44:29,0 --> 05:44:29,0
suffered

130
05:44:29,0 --> 05:44:29,0
the

131
05:44:29,0 --> 05:44:29,0
counsel of thy

132
05:44:29,0 --> 05:44:29,0
director

133
05:44:29,0 --> 05:44:29,0
to be

134
05:44:29,0 --> 05:44:29,0
trampled

135
05:44:29,0 --> 05:44:29,0
upon from

136
05:44:29,0 --> 05:40:09,
the beginning.

137
05:40:09,0 --> 05:40:09,0
16

138
05:40:09,0 --> 05:40:09,0
Nevertheless,

139
05:40:09,0 --> 05:40:09,0
my work

140
05:40:09,0 --> 05:40:09,0
shall

141
05:40:09,0 --> 05:40:09,0
go forth,

142
05:40:09,0 --> 05:40:09,0
for

143
05:40:09,0 --> 05:40:09,0
inasmuch as

144
05:40:09,0 --> 05:40:09,0
the

145
05:40:09,0 --> 05:40:09,0
knowledge

146
05:40:09,0 --> 05:40:09,0
of a

147
05:40:09,0 --> 05:40:09,0
Savior has

148
05:40:09,0 --> 05:40:09,0
come unto

149
05:40:09,0 --> 05:40:09,0
the

150
05:40:09,0 --> 05:40:09,0
world,

151
05:40:09,0 --> 05:40:09,0
through the

152
05:40:09,0 --> 05:40:09,0


153
05:40:09,0 --> 05:40:09,0
testimony of the

154
05:40:09,0 --> 05:40:09,0
Jews,

155
05:40:09,0 --> 05:40:09,0
even so

156
05:40:09,0 --> 05:40:09,0
shall the

157
05:40:09,0 --> 05:40:09,0


158
05:40:09,0 --> 05:40:09,0
knowledge of a

159
05:40:09,0 --> 05:44:46,
Savior come unto my people—

160
05:44:46,0 --> 05:44:46,0
17 And

161
05:44:46,0 --> 05:44:46,0
to the

162
05:44:46,0 --> 05:44:46,0


163
05:44:46,0 --> 05:44:46,0
Nephites, and

164
05:44:46,0 --> 05:44:46,0
the

165
05:44:46,0 --> 05:44:46,0
Jacobites,

166
05:44:46,0 --> 05:44:46,0
and

167
05:44:46,0 --> 05:44:46,0
the

168
05:44:46,0 --> 05:44:46,0
Josephites,

169
05:44:46,0 --> 05:44:46,0
and the

170
05:44:46,0 --> 05:44:46,0


171
05:44:46,0 --> 05:44:46,0
Zoramites,

172
05:44:46,0 --> 05:44:46,0
through

173
05:44:46,0 --> 05:44:46,0
the

174
05:44:46,0 --> 05:44:46,0
testimony

175
05:44:46,0 --> 05:44:24,
of their fathers—

176
05:44:24,0 --> 05:44:24,0
18 And

177
05:44:24,0 --> 05:44:24,0
this

178
05:44:24,0 --> 05:44:24,0
testimony

179
05:44:24,0 --> 05:44:24,0
shall

180
05:44:24,0 --> 05:44:24,0
come to

181
05:44:24,0 --> 05:44:24,0
the

182
05:44:24,0 --> 05:44:24,0
knowledge

183
05:44:24,0 --> 05:44:24,0
of the

184
05:44:24,0 --> 05:44:24,0


185
05:44:24,0 --> 05:44:24,0
Lamanites,

186
05:44:24,0 --> 05:44:24,0
and the

187
05:44:24,0 --> 05:44:24,0


188
05:44:24,0 --> 05:44:24,0
Lemuelites, and

189
05:44:24,0 --> 05:44:24,0
the

190
05:44:24,0 --> 05:44:24,0


191
05:44:24,0 --> 05:44:24,0
Ishmaelites, who

192
05:44:24,0 --> 05:44:24,0


193
05:44:24,0 --> 05:44:24,0
dwindled in

194
05:44:24,0 --> 05:44:24,0
unbelief

195
05:44:24,0 --> 05:44:24,0


196
05:44:24,0 --> 05:44:24,0
because of

197
05:44:24,0 --> 05:44:24,0
the

198
05:44:24,0 --> 05:44:24,0
iniquity of

199
05:44:24,0 --> 05:44:24,0
their

200
05:44:24,0 --> 05:44:24,0
fathers,

201
05:44:24,0 --> 05:44:24,0
whom

202
05:44:24,0 --> 05:44:24,0
the Lord

203
05:44:24,0 --> 05:44:24,0
has

204
05:44:24,0 --> 05:44:24,0
suffered

205
05:44:24,0 --> 05:44:24,0
to

206
05:44:24,0 --> 05:44:24,0
destroy

207
05:44:24,0 --> 05:44:24,0
their

208
05:44:24,0 --> 05:44:24,0
brethren

209
05:44:24,0 --> 05:44:24,0
the

210
05:44:24,0 --> 05:44:24,0
Nephites,

211
05:44:24,0 --> 05:44:24,0
because

212
05:44:24,0 --> 05:44:24,0
of their

213
05:44:24,0 --> 05:44:24,0


214
05:44:24,0 --> 05:44:24,0
iniquities

215
05:44:24,0 --> 05:44:24,0
and their

216
05:44:24,0 --> 05:44:24,0


217
05:44:24,0 --> 05:40:04,
abominations.

218
05:40:04,0 --> 05:40:04,0
19 And

219
05:40:04,0 --> 05:40:04,0
for

220
05:40:04,0 --> 05:40:04,0
this

221
05:40:04,0 --> 05:40:04,0
very

222
05:40:04,0 --> 05:40:04,0
purpose

223
05:40:04,0 --> 05:40:04,0
are

224
05:40:04,0 --> 05:40:04,0
these

225
05:40:04,0 --> 05:40:04,0
plates

226
05:40:04,0 --> 05:40:04,0
