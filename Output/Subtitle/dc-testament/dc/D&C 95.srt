00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 95 Revelation given through Joseph

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, June 1,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
1833. This revelation is a continuation of divine

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
directions to build a house for worship and

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
instruction, the house of the Lord (see

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
section 88:119–36). 
1–6, The Saints are chastened

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
for their failure to build the house of the

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Lord; 
7–10, The Lord desires to use His house to

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
endow His people with power from on high;

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
11–17, The house is to be dedicated as a place

11
00:00:00,0 --> 01:20:54,
of worship and for the school of the Apostles. 

12
01:20:54,0 --> 01:20:54,0
1 Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you

13
01:20:54,0 --> 01:20:54,0
whom I love, and whom I love I also

14
01:20:54,0 --> 01:20:54,0
chasten that their sins may be forgiven,

15
01:20:54,0 --> 01:20:54,0
for with the chastisement I prepare a

16
01:20:54,0 --> 01:20:54,0
way for their deliverance in all things

17
01:20:54,0 --> 01:43:54,
out of temptation, and I have loved you—

18
01:43:54,0 --> 01:43:54,0
2 Wherefore, ye must needs be

19
01:43:54,0 --> 01:46:56,
chastened and stand rebuked before my face;

20
01:46:56,0 --> 01:46:56,0
3 For ye have sinned against me

21
01:46:56,0 --> 01:46:56,0
a very grievous sin, in that

22
01:46:56,0 --> 01:46:56,0
ye have not considered the great

23
01:46:56,0 --> 01:46:56,0
commandment in all things,

24
01:46:56,0 --> 01:46:56,0
that I have given unto you

25
01:46:56,0 --> 01:53:59,
concerning the building of mine house;

26
01:53:59,0 --> 01:53:59,0
4 For the preparation

27
01:53:59,0 --> 01:53:59,0
wherewith I design to prepare

28
01:53:59,0 --> 01:53:59,0
mine apostles to prune my

29
01:53:59,0 --> 01:53:59,0
vineyard for the last time,

30
01:53:59,0 --> 01:53:59,0
that I may bring to pass my

31
01:53:59,0 --> 01:53:59,0
strange act, that I may pour

32
01:53:59,0 --> 02:13:36,
out my Spirit upon all flesh—

33
02:13:36,0 --> 02:13:36,0
5 But behold, verily I

34
02:13:36,0 --> 02:13:36,0
say unto you, that

35
02:13:36,0 --> 02:13:36,0
there are many who have

36
02:13:36,0 --> 02:13:36,0
been ordained among

37
02:13:36,0 --> 02:13:36,0
you, whom I have called

38
02:13:36,0 --> 02:41:12,
but few of them are chosen.

39
02:41:12,0 --> 02:41:12,0
6 They who are not

40
02:41:12,0 --> 02:41:12,0
chosen have sinned a

41
02:41:12,0 --> 02:41:12,0
very grievous sin, in

42
02:41:12,0 --> 02:41:12,0
that they are walking

43
02:41:12,0 --> 02:51:45,
in darkness at noon-day.

44
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
7 And for this cause

45
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
I gave unto you a

46
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
commandment that you

47
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
should call your

48
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
solemn assembly, that

49
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
your fastings and

50
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
your mourning might

51
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
come up into the ears

52
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
of the Lord of

53
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
Sabaoth, which is by

54
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
interpretation, the

55
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
creator of the first day,

56
02:51:45,0 --> 02:55:52,
the beginning and the end.

57
02:55:52,0 --> 02:55:52,0
8 Yea, verily I say

58
02:55:52,0 --> 02:55:52,0
unto you, I gave

59
02:55:52,0 --> 02:55:52,0
unto you a

60
02:55:52,0 --> 02:55:52,0
commandment that you should

61
02:55:52,0 --> 02:55:52,0
build a house, in

62
02:55:52,0 --> 02:55:52,0
the which house I

63
02:55:52,0 --> 02:55:52,0
design to endow those

64
02:55:52,0 --> 02:55:52,0
whom I have chosen

65
02:55:52,0 --> 03:15:57,
with power from on high;

66
03:15:57,0 --> 03:15:57,0
9 For this is the

67
03:15:57,0 --> 03:15:57,0
promise of the

68
03:15:57,0 --> 03:15:57,0
Father unto you;

69
03:15:57,0 --> 03:15:57,0
therefore I

70
03:15:57,0 --> 03:15:57,0
command you to tarry,

71
03:15:57,0 --> 03:15:57,0
even as mine

72
03:15:57,0 --> 03:42:28,
apostles at Jerusalem.

73
03:42:28,0 --> 03:42:28,0
10 Nevertheless,

74
03:42:28,0 --> 03:42:28,0
my servants

75
03:42:28,0 --> 03:42:28,0
sinned a very grievous

76
03:42:28,0 --> 03:42:28,0
sin; and

77
03:42:28,0 --> 03:42:28,0
contentions arose in the

78
03:42:28,0 --> 03:42:28,0
school of the

79
03:42:28,0 --> 03:42:28,0
prophets; which was

80
03:42:28,0 --> 03:42:28,0
very grievous

81
03:42:28,0 --> 03:42:28,0
unto me, saith your

82
03:42:28,0 --> 03:42:28,0
Lord; therefore

83
03:42:28,0 --> 03:42:28,0
I sent them forth

84
03:42:28,0 --> 03:57:30,
to be chastened.

85
03:57:30,0 --> 03:57:30,0
11 Verily I say

86
03:57:30,0 --> 03:57:30,0
unto you, it is

87
03:57:30,0 --> 03:57:30,0
my will that you

88
03:57:30,0 --> 03:57:30,0
should build a

89
03:57:30,0 --> 03:57:30,0
house. If you

90
03:57:30,0 --> 03:57:30,0
keep my

91
03:57:30,0 --> 03:57:30,0
commandments you shall

92
03:57:30,0 --> 03:58:34,
have power to build it.

93
03:58:34,0 --> 03:58:34,0
12 If you keep

94
03:58:34,0 --> 03:58:34,0
not my

95
03:58:34,0 --> 03:58:34,0
commandments, the love

96
03:58:34,0 --> 03:58:34,0
of the Father

97
03:58:34,0 --> 03:58:34,0
shall not

98
03:58:34,0 --> 03:58:34,0
continue with you,

99
03:58:34,0 --> 03:58:34,0
therefore you

100
03:58:34,0 --> 04:03:39,
shall walk in darkness.

101
04:03:39,0 --> 04:03:39,0
13 Now here is

102
04:03:39,0 --> 04:03:39,0
wisdom, and the

103
04:03:39,0 --> 04:03:39,0
mind of the

104
04:03:39,0 --> 04:03:39,0
Lord—let the

105
04:03:39,0 --> 04:03:39,0
house be built, not

106
04:03:39,0 --> 04:03:39,0
after the

107
04:03:39,0 --> 04:03:39,0
manner of the

108
04:03:39,0 --> 04:03:39,0
world, for I give

109
04:03:39,0 --> 04:03:39,0
not unto you that

110
04:03:39,0 --> 04:03:39,0
ye shall live

111
04:03:39,0 --> 04:03:39,0
after the

112
04:03:39,0 --> 04:10:14,
manner of the world;

113
04:10:14,0 --> 04:10:14,0
14 Therefore,

114
04:10:14,0 --> 04:10:14,0
let it be

115
04:10:14,0 --> 04:10:14,0
built after the

116
04:10:14,0 --> 04:10:14,0
manner which I

117
04:10:14,0 --> 04:10:14,0
shall show unto

118
04:10:14,0 --> 04:10:14,0
three of you,

119
04:10:14,0 --> 04:10:14,0
whom ye shall

120
04:10:14,0 --> 04:10:14,0
appoint and

121
04:10:14,0 --> 04:17:16,
ordain unto this power.

122
04:17:16,0 --> 04:17:16,0
15 And the

123
04:17:16,0 --> 04:17:16,0
size thereof

124
04:17:16,0 --> 04:17:16,0
shall be fifty

125
04:17:16,0 --> 04:17:16,0
and five feet

126
04:17:16,0 --> 04:17:16,0
in width,

127
04:17:16,0 --> 04:17:16,0
and let it be

128
04:17:16,0 --> 04:17:16,0
sixty-five

129
04:17:16,0 --> 04:17:16,0
feet in length,

130
04:17:16,0 --> 04:17:16,0
in the inner

131
04:17:16,0 --> 04:26:18,
court thereof.

132
04:26:18,0 --> 04:26:18,0
16 And let

133
04:26:18,0 --> 04:26:18,0
the lower

134
04:26:18,0 --> 04:26:18,0
part of the

135
04:26:18,0 --> 04:26:18,0
inner court be

136
04:26:18,0 --> 04:26:18,0
dedicated

137
04:26:18,0 --> 04:26:18,0
unto me for

138
04:26:18,0 --> 04:26:18,0
your sacrament

139
04:26:18,0 --> 04:26:18,0
offering,

140
04:26:18,0 --> 04:26:18,0
and for your

141
04:26:18,0 --> 04:26:18,0
preaching,

142
04:26:18,0 --> 04:26:18,0
and your

143
04:26:18,0 --> 04:26:18,0
fasting, and

144
04:26:18,0 --> 04:26:18,0
your praying,

145
04:26:18,0 --> 04:26:18,0
and the

146
04:26:18,0 --> 04:26:18,0
offering up of

147
04:26:18,0 --> 04:26:18,0
your most holy

148
04:26:18,0 --> 04:26:18,0
desires

149
04:26:18,0 --> 04:30:25,
unto me, saith your Lord.

150
04:30:25,0 --> 04:30:25,0
17 And let

151
04:30:25,0 --> 04:30:25,0
the higher

152
04:30:25,0 --> 04:30:25,0
part of the

153
04:30:25,0 --> 04:30:25,0
inner

154
04:30:25,0 --> 04:30:25,0
court be

155
04:30:25,0 --> 04:30:25,0
dedicated unto me

156
04:30:25,0 --> 04:30:25,0
for the

157
04:30:25,0 --> 04:30:25,0
school of

158
04:30:25,0 --> 04:30:25,0
mine apostles,

159
04:30:25,0 --> 04:30:25,0
saith Son

160
04:30:25,0 --> 04:30:25,0
Ahman; or,

161
04:30:25,0 --> 04:30:25,0
in other

162
04:30:25,0 --> 04:30:25,0
words,

163
04:30:25,0 --> 04:30:25,0
Alphus; or, in

164
04:30:25,0 --> 04:30:25,0
other words,

165
04:30:25,0 --> 04:30:25,0
Omegus;

166
04:30:25,0 --> 04:30:25,0
even Jesus

167
04:30:25,0 --> 04:32:29,
Christ your Lord. Amen.
