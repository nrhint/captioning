00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:17,642
Section 95 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:24,006
 the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, June 1, 1833. This

3
00:00:24,006 --> 00:00:30,37
 revelation is a continuation of divine directions

4
00:00:30,37 --> 00:00:36,734
 to build a house for worship and instruction, the

5
00:00:36,734 --> 00:00:43,098
 house of the Lord (see 
section 88:119–36). 
1–6,

6
00:00:43,098 --> 00:00:49,462
 The Saints are chastened for their failure to

7
00:00:49,462 --> 00:00:55,826
 build the house of the Lord; 
7–10, The Lord desires

8
00:00:55,826 --> 00:01:02,19
 to use His house to endow His people with power

9
00:01:02,19 --> 00:01:08,554
 from on high; 
11–17, The house is to be dedicated as

10
00:01:08,554 --> 00:01:14,918
 a place of worship and for the school of the

11
00:01:14,918 --> 00:01:21,282
 Apostles.

12
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:26,648
1 Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you whom I

13
00:01:26,648 --> 00:01:31,848
 love, and whom I love I also chasten that their sins

14
00:01:31,848 --> 00:01:37,048
 may be forgiven, for with the chastisement I

15
00:01:37,048 --> 00:01:42,248
 prepare a way for their deliverance in all things out of

16
00:01:42,248 --> 00:01:47,448
 temptation, and I have loved you

17
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:50,941
2 Wherefore, ye must needs be chastened and stand

18
00:01:50,941 --> 00:01:54,441
 rebuked before my face

19
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:59,198
3 For ye have sinned against me a very grievous

20
00:01:59,198 --> 00:02:03,948
 sin, in that ye have not considered the great

21
00:02:03,948 --> 00:02:08,698
 commandment in all things, that I have given unto you

22
00:02:08,698 --> 00:02:13,448
 concerning the building of mine house

23
00:02:13,95 --> 00:02:20,95
4 For the preparation wherewith I design to

24
00:02:20,95 --> 00:02:27,95
 prepare mine apostles to prune my vineyard for the last

25
00:02:27,95 --> 00:02:34,95
 time, that I may bring to pass my strange act,

26
00:02:34,95 --> 00:02:41,95
 that I may pour out my Spirit upon all flesh

27
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:46,728
5 But behold, verily I say unto you, that there

28
00:02:46,728 --> 00:02:51,728
 are many who have been ordained among you, whom I

29
00:02:51,728 --> 00:02:56,728
 have called but few of them are chosen

30
00:02:56,743 --> 00:03:03,41
6 They who are not chosen have sinned a very

31
00:03:03,41 --> 00:03:10,077
 grievous sin, in that they are walking in darkness at

32
00:03:10,077 --> 00:03:16,744
 noon-day

33
00:03:16,747 --> 00:03:21,247
7 And for this cause I gave unto you a commandment

34
00:03:21,247 --> 00:03:25,747
 that you should call your solemn assembly, that

35
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:30,247
 your fastings and your mourning might come up into

36
00:03:30,247 --> 00:03:34,747
 the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth, which is by

37
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:39,247
 interpretation, the creator of the first day, the

38
00:03:39,247 --> 00:03:43,747
 beginning and the end

39
00:03:43,273 --> 00:03:47,273
8 Yea, verily I say unto you, I gave unto you a

40
00:03:47,273 --> 00:03:51,273
 commandment that you should build a house, in the

41
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:55,273
 which house I design to endow those whom I have

42
00:03:55,273 --> 00:03:59,273
 chosen with power from on high

43
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:03,823
9 For this is the promise of the Father unto you;

44
00:04:03,823 --> 00:04:07,823
 therefore I command you to tarry, even as mine

45
00:04:07,823 --> 00:04:11,823
 apostles at Jerusalem

46
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:15,734
10 Nevertheless, my servants sinned a very

47
00:04:15,734 --> 00:04:20,134
 grievous sin; and contentions arose in the school of the

48
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:24,534
 prophets; which was very grievous unto me, saith

49
00:04:24,534 --> 00:04:28,934
 your Lord; therefore I sent them forth to be

50
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:33,334
 chastened

51
00:04:33,323 --> 00:04:37,99
11 Verily I say unto you, it is my will that you

52
00:04:37,99 --> 00:04:42,657
 should build a house. If you keep my commandments

53
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:47,324
 you shall have power to build it

54
00:04:47,32 --> 00:04:51,987
12 If you keep not my commandments, the love of

55
00:04:51,987 --> 00:04:56,654
 the Father shall not continue with you, therefore

56
00:04:56,654 --> 00:05:01,321
 you shall walk in darkness

57
00:05:01,084 --> 00:05:05,834
13 Now here is wisdom, and the mind of the

58
00:05:05,834 --> 00:05:10,584
 Lord—let the house be built, not after the manner of the

59
00:05:10,584 --> 00:05:15,334
 world, for I give not unto you that ye shall live

60
00:05:15,334 --> 00:05:20,084
 after the manner of the world

61
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:25,02
14 Therefore, let it be built after the manner

62
00:05:25,02 --> 00:05:29,687
 which I shall show unto three of you, whom ye shall

63
00:05:29,687 --> 00:05:34,354
 appoint and ordain unto this power

64
00:05:34,351 --> 00:05:38,684
15 And the size thereof shall be fifty and five

65
00:05:38,684 --> 00:05:43,017
 feet in width, and let it be sixty-five feet in

66
00:05:43,017 --> 00:05:47,35
 length, in the inner court thereof

67
00:05:47,13 --> 00:05:51,33
16 And let the lower part of the inner court be

68
00:05:51,33 --> 00:05:55,53
 dedicated unto me for your sacrament offering, and

69
00:05:55,53 --> 00:05:59,73
 for your preaching, and your fasting, and your

70
00:05:59,73 --> 00:06:03,93
 praying, and the offering up of your most holy desires

71
00:06:03,93 --> 00:06:08,13
 unto me, saith your Lord

72
00:06:08,885 --> 00:06:14,485
17 And let the higher part of the inner court be

73
00:06:14,485 --> 00:06:20,085
 dedicated unto me for the school of mine apostles,

74
00:06:20,085 --> 00:06:25,685
 saith Son Ahman; or, in other words, Alphus; or,

75
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:31,285
 in other words, Omegus; even Jesus Christ your

76
00:06:31,285 --> 00:06:36,885
 Lord. Amen.
