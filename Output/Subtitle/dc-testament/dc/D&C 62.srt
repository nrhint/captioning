Section 62 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Prophet, on the bank of the Missouri River

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
at Chariton, Missouri, August 13, 1831. On this

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
day the Prophet and his group, who were on their

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
way from Independence to Kirtland, met several

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
elders who were on their way to the land of

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Zion, and, after joyful salutations, received this

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
revelation. 
1–3, Testimonies are recorded in

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
heaven; 
4–9, The elders are to travel and preach

10
00:00:00,0 --> 01:10:55,
according to judgment and as directed by the Spirit. 

11
01:10:55,0 --> 01:10:55,0
1 Behold, and hearken, O ye elders of my

12
01:10:55,0 --> 01:10:55,0
church, saith the Lord your God, even Jesus

13
01:10:55,0 --> 01:10:55,0
Christ, your advocate, who knoweth the weakness

14
01:10:55,0 --> 01:35:56,
of man and how to succor them who are tempted.

15
01:35:56,0 --> 01:35:56,0
2 And verily mine eyes are upon those who

16
01:35:56,0 --> 01:35:56,0
have not as yet gone up unto the land of

17
01:35:56,0 --> 01:50:58,
Zion; wherefore your mission is not yet full.

18
01:50:58,0 --> 01:50:58,0
3 Nevertheless, ye are blessed, for

19
01:50:58,0 --> 01:50:58,0
the testimony which ye have borne

20
01:50:58,0 --> 01:50:58,0
is recorded in heaven for the

21
01:50:58,0 --> 01:50:58,0
angels to look upon; and they rejoice

22
01:50:58,0 --> 02:13:59,
over you, and your sins are forgiven you.

23
02:13:59,0 --> 02:13:59,0
4 And now continue your

24
02:13:59,0 --> 02:13:59,0
journey. Assemble yourselves upon the

25
02:13:59,0 --> 02:13:59,0
land of Zion; and hold a

26
02:13:59,0 --> 02:13:59,0
meeting and rejoice together, and

27
02:13:59,0 --> 02:15:03,
offer a sacrament unto the Most High.

28
02:15:03,0 --> 02:15:03,0
5 And then you may return to

29
02:15:03,0 --> 02:15:03,0
bear record, yea, even

30
02:15:03,0 --> 02:15:03,0
altogether, or two by two, as seemeth

31
02:15:03,0 --> 02:15:03,0
you good, it mattereth not

32
02:15:03,0 --> 02:15:03,0
unto me; only be faithful, and

33
02:15:03,0 --> 02:15:03,0
declare glad tidings unto the

34
02:15:03,0 --> 02:15:03,0
inhabitants of the earth, or

35
02:15:03,0 --> 02:34:03,
among the congregations of the wicked.

36
02:34:03,0 --> 02:34:03,0
6 Behold, I, the Lord, have

37
02:34:03,0 --> 02:34:03,0
brought you together that

38
02:34:03,0 --> 02:34:03,0
the promise might be

39
02:34:03,0 --> 02:34:03,0
fulfilled, that the faithful among

40
02:34:03,0 --> 02:34:03,0
you should be preserved and

41
02:34:03,0 --> 02:34:03,0
rejoice together in the land

42
02:34:03,0 --> 02:34:03,0
of Missouri. I, the Lord,

43
02:34:03,0 --> 03:05:03,
promise the faithful and cannot lie.

44
03:05:03,0 --> 03:05:03,0
7 I, the Lord, am willing,

45
03:05:03,0 --> 03:05:03,0
if any among you desire

46
03:05:03,0 --> 03:05:03,0
to ride upon horses, or

47
03:05:03,0 --> 03:05:03,0
upon mules, or in chariots,

48
03:05:03,0 --> 03:05:03,0
he shall receive this

49
03:05:03,0 --> 03:05:03,0
blessing, if he receive it from

50
03:05:03,0 --> 03:05:03,0
the hand of the Lord,

51
03:05:03,0 --> 03:30:04,
with a thankful heart in all things.

52
03:30:04,0 --> 03:30:04,0
8 These things remain

53
03:30:04,0 --> 03:30:04,0
with you to do according

54
03:30:04,0 --> 03:30:04,0
to judgment and the

55
03:30:04,0 --> 03:41:04,
directions of the Spirit.

56
03:41:04,0 --> 03:41:04,0
9 Behold, the

57
03:41:04,0 --> 03:41:04,0
kingdom is yours. And

58
03:41:04,0 --> 03:41:04,0
behold, and lo, I am

59
03:41:04,0 --> 03:41:04,0
with the faithful

60
03:41:04,0 --> 03:53:10,
always. Even so. Amen.
