Section 62 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:17,295 --> 00:00:23,295
 the Prophet, on the bank of the Missouri River at

3
00:00:23,295 --> 00:00:29,295
 Chariton, Missouri, August 13, 1831. On this day

4
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:35,295
 the Prophet and his group, who were on their way

5
00:00:35,295 --> 00:00:41,295
 from Independence to Kirtland, met several elders who

6
00:00:41,295 --> 00:00:47,295
 were on their way to the land of Zion, and, after

7
00:00:47,295 --> 00:00:53,295
 joyful salutations, received this revelation.

8
00:00:53,295 --> 00:00:59,295
1–3, Testimonies are recorded in heaven; 
4–9, The

9
00:00:59,295 --> 00:01:05,295
 elders are to travel and preach according to

10
00:01:05,295 --> 00:01:11,295
 judgment and as directed by the Spirit.

11
00:01:11,922 --> 00:01:18,172
1 Behold, and hearken, O ye elders of my church,

12
00:01:18,172 --> 00:01:24,422
 saith the Lord your God, even Jesus Christ, your

13
00:01:24,422 --> 00:01:30,672
 advocate, who knoweth the weakness of man and how to

14
00:01:30,672 --> 00:01:36,922
 succor them who are tempted

15
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:41,697
2 And verily mine eyes are upon those who have not

16
00:01:41,697 --> 00:01:46,697
 as yet gone up unto the land of Zion; wherefore

17
00:01:46,697 --> 00:01:51,697
 your mission is not yet full

18
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:57,945
3 Nevertheless, ye are blessed, for the testimony

19
00:01:57,945 --> 00:02:04,195
 which ye have borne is recorded in heaven for the

20
00:02:04,195 --> 00:02:10,445
 angels to look upon; and they rejoice over you,

21
00:02:10,445 --> 00:02:16,695
 and your sins are forgiven you

22
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:20,986
4 And now continue your journey. Assemble

23
00:02:20,986 --> 00:02:25,736
 yourselves upon the land of Zion; and hold a meeting and

24
00:02:25,736 --> 00:02:30,486
 rejoice together, and offer a sacrament unto the

25
00:02:30,486 --> 00:02:35,236
 Most High

26
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:41,438
5 And then you may return to bear record, yea,

27
00:02:41,438 --> 00:02:47,638
 even altogether, or two by two, as seemeth you good,

28
00:02:47,638 --> 00:02:53,838
 it mattereth not unto me; only be faithful, and

29
00:02:53,838 --> 00:03:00,038
 declare glad tidings unto the inhabitants of the

30
00:03:00,038 --> 00:03:06,238
 earth, or among the congregations of the wicked

31
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:11,486
6 Behold, I, the Lord, have brought you together

32
00:03:11,486 --> 00:03:16,486
 that the promise might be fulfilled, that the

33
00:03:16,486 --> 00:03:21,486
 faithful among you should be preserved and rejoice

34
00:03:21,486 --> 00:03:26,486
 together in the land of Missouri. I, the Lord, promise

35
00:03:26,486 --> 00:03:31,486
 the faithful and cannot lie

36
00:03:31,762 --> 00:03:36,162
7 I, the Lord, am willing, if any among you desire

37
00:03:36,162 --> 00:03:40,562
 to ride upon horses, or upon mules, or in

38
00:03:40,562 --> 00:03:44,962
 chariots, he shall receive this blessing, if he receive

39
00:03:44,962 --> 00:03:49,362
 it from the hand of the Lord, with a thankful heart

40
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:53,762
 in all things

41
00:03:53,75 --> 00:03:58,75
8 These things remain with you to do according to

42
00:03:58,75 --> 00:04:03,75
 judgment and the directions of the Spirit

43
00:04:03,527 --> 00:04:12,027
9 Behold, the kingdom is yours. And behold, and

44
00:04:12,027 --> 00:04:20,527
 lo, I am with the faithful always. Even so. Amen.
