00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 87 Revelation and prophecy on war,

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at or near

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Kirtland, Ohio, December 25, 1832. At this time

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
disputes in the United States over slavery and

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
South Carolina’s nullification of federal

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
tariffs were prevalent. Joseph Smith’s history

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
states that “appearances of troubles among the

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
nations” were becoming “more visible” to the

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Prophet “than they had previously been since the

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Church began her journey out of the wilderness.”

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
1–4, War is foretold between the Northern States

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and the Southern States; 
5–8, Great

13
00:00:00,0 --> 01:34:52,
calamities will fall upon all the inhabitants of the earth. 

14
01:34:52,0 --> 01:34:52,0
1 Verily, thus saith the Lord

15
01:34:52,0 --> 01:34:52,0
concerning the wars that will shortly come to

16
01:34:52,0 --> 01:34:52,0
pass, beginning at the rebellion of South

17
01:34:52,0 --> 01:34:52,0
Carolina, which will eventually

18
01:34:52,0 --> 01:35:56,
terminate in the death and misery of many souls;

19
01:35:56,0 --> 01:35:56,0
2 And the time will come that

20
01:35:56,0 --> 01:35:56,0
war will be poured out upon all

21
01:35:56,0 --> 01:58:57,
nations, beginning at this place.

22
01:58:57,0 --> 01:58:57,0
3 For behold, the Southern

23
01:58:57,0 --> 01:58:57,0
States shall be divided against

24
01:58:57,0 --> 01:58:57,0
the Northern States, and the

25
01:58:57,0 --> 01:58:57,0
Southern States will call on

26
01:58:57,0 --> 01:58:57,0
other nations, even the nation of

27
01:58:57,0 --> 01:58:57,0
Great Britain, as it is

28
01:58:57,0 --> 01:58:57,0
called, and they shall also call

29
01:58:57,0 --> 01:58:57,0
upon other nations, in order to

30
01:58:57,0 --> 01:58:57,0
defend themselves against

31
01:58:57,0 --> 01:58:57,0
other nations; and then war shall

32
01:58:57,0 --> 01:58:35,
be poured out upon all nations.

33
01:58:35,0 --> 01:58:35,0
4 And it shall come to

34
01:58:35,0 --> 01:58:35,0
pass, after many days, slaves

35
01:58:35,0 --> 01:58:35,0
shall rise up against their

36
01:58:35,0 --> 01:58:35,0
masters, who shall be

37
01:58:35,0 --> 01:54:15,
marshaled and disciplined for war.

38
01:54:15,0 --> 01:54:15,0
5 And it shall come to

39
01:54:15,0 --> 01:54:15,0
pass also that the remnants

40
01:54:15,0 --> 01:54:15,0
who are left of the land

41
01:54:15,0 --> 01:54:15,0
will marshal themselves, and

42
01:54:15,0 --> 01:54:15,0
shall become exceedingly

43
01:54:15,0 --> 01:54:15,0
angry, and shall vex the

44
01:54:15,0 --> 01:59:20,
Gentiles with a sore vexation.

45
01:59:20,0 --> 01:59:20,0
6 And thus, with the

46
01:59:20,0 --> 01:59:20,0
sword and by bloodshed the

47
01:59:20,0 --> 01:59:20,0
inhabitants of the earth

48
01:59:20,0 --> 01:59:20,0
shall mourn; and with

49
01:59:20,0 --> 01:59:20,0
famine, and plague, and

50
01:59:20,0 --> 01:59:20,0
earthquake, and the thunder of

51
01:59:20,0 --> 01:59:20,0
heaven, and the fierce

52
01:59:20,0 --> 01:59:20,0
and vivid lightning also,

53
01:59:20,0 --> 01:59:20,0
shall the inhabitants of

54
01:59:20,0 --> 01:59:20,0
the earth be made to feel

55
01:59:20,0 --> 01:59:20,0
the wrath, and

56
01:59:20,0 --> 01:59:20,0
indignation, and chastening hand of

57
01:59:20,0 --> 01:59:20,0
an Almighty God, until

58
01:59:20,0 --> 01:59:20,0
the consumption decreed

59
01:59:20,0 --> 01:58:24,
hath made a full end of all nations;

60
01:58:24,0 --> 01:58:24,0
7 That the cry of the

61
01:58:24,0 --> 01:58:24,0
saints, and of the blood

62
01:58:24,0 --> 01:58:24,0
of the saints, shall

63
01:58:24,0 --> 01:58:24,0
cease to come up into the

64
01:58:24,0 --> 01:58:24,0
ears of the Lord of

65
01:58:24,0 --> 01:58:24,0
Sabaoth, from the earth, to be

66
01:58:24,0 --> 01:54:04,
avenged of their enemies.

67
01:54:04,0 --> 01:54:04,0
8 Wherefore, stand ye

68
01:54:04,0 --> 01:54:04,0
in holy places, and be

69
01:54:04,0 --> 01:54:04,0
not moved, until the day

70
01:54:04,0 --> 01:54:04,0
of the Lord come; for

71
01:54:04,0 --> 01:54:04,0
behold, it cometh

72
01:54:04,0 --> 01:59:09,
quickly, saith the Lord. Amen.
