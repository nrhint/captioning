00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:17,816
Section 87 Revelation and prophecy on war, given

2
00:00:17,816 --> 00:00:24,354
 through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at or near

3
00:00:24,354 --> 00:00:30,892
 Kirtland, Ohio, December 25, 1832. At this time disputes

4
00:00:30,892 --> 00:00:37,43
 in the United States over slavery and South

5
00:00:37,43 --> 00:00:43,968
 Carolina’s nullification of federal tariffs were

6
00:00:43,968 --> 00:00:50,506
 prevalent. Joseph Smith’s history states that

7
00:00:50,506 --> 00:00:57,044
 “appearances of troubles among the nations” were becoming

8
00:00:57,044 --> 00:01:03,582
 “more visible” to the Prophet “than they had

9
00:01:03,582 --> 00:01:10,12
 previously been since the Church began her journey out of

10
00:01:10,12 --> 00:01:16,658
 the wilderness.” 
1–4, War is foretold between

11
00:01:16,658 --> 00:01:23,196
 the Northern States and the Southern States; 
5–8,

12
00:01:23,196 --> 00:01:29,734
 Great calamities will fall upon all the inhabitants

13
00:01:29,734 --> 00:01:36,272
 of the earth.

14
00:01:36,947 --> 00:01:43,197
1 Verily, thus saith the Lord concerning the wars

15
00:01:43,197 --> 00:01:49,447
 that will shortly come to pass, beginning at the

16
00:01:49,447 --> 00:01:55,697
 rebellion of South Carolina, which will eventually

17
00:01:55,697 --> 00:02:01,947
 terminate in the death and misery of many souls

18
00:02:01,238 --> 00:02:08,738
2 And the time will come that war will be poured

19
00:02:08,738 --> 00:02:16,238
 out upon all nations, beginning at this place

20
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:22,236
3 For behold, the Southern States shall be divided

21
00:02:22,236 --> 00:02:28,236
 against the Northern States, and the Southern

22
00:02:28,236 --> 00:02:34,236
 States will call on other nations, even the nation of

23
00:02:34,236 --> 00:02:40,236
 Great Britain, as it is called, and they shall

24
00:02:40,236 --> 00:02:46,236
 also call upon other nations, in order to defend

25
00:02:46,236 --> 00:02:52,236
 themselves against other nations; and then war shall

26
00:02:52,236 --> 00:02:58,236
 be poured out upon all nations

27
00:02:58,495 --> 00:03:05,495
4 And it shall come to pass, after many days,

28
00:03:05,495 --> 00:03:12,495
 slaves shall rise up against their masters, who shall

29
00:03:12,495 --> 00:03:19,495
 be marshaled and disciplined for war

30
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:23,782
5 And it shall come to pass also that the remnants

31
00:03:23,782 --> 00:03:28,282
 who are left of the land will marshal themselves,

32
00:03:28,282 --> 00:03:32,782
 and shall become exceedingly angry, and shall vex

33
00:03:32,782 --> 00:03:37,282
 the Gentiles with a sore vexation

34
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:43,193
6 And thus, with the sword and by bloodshed the

35
00:03:43,193 --> 00:03:48,568
 inhabitants of the earth shall mourn; and with

36
00:03:48,568 --> 00:03:53,943
 famine, and plague, and earthquake, and the thunder of

37
00:03:53,943 --> 00:03:59,318
 heaven, and the fierce and vivid lightning also,

38
00:03:59,318 --> 00:04:04,693
 shall the inhabitants of the earth be made to feel

39
00:04:04,693 --> 00:04:10,068
 the wrath, and indignation, and chastening hand of

40
00:04:10,068 --> 00:04:15,443
 an Almighty God, until the consumption decreed

41
00:04:15,443 --> 00:04:20,818
 hath made a full end of all nations

42
00:04:20,31 --> 00:04:25,81
7 That the cry of the saints, and of the blood of

43
00:04:25,81 --> 00:04:31,31
 the saints, shall cease to come up into the ears

44
00:04:31,31 --> 00:04:36,81
 of the Lord of Sabaoth, from the earth, to be

45
00:04:36,81 --> 00:04:42,31
 avenged of their enemies

46
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:49,582
8 Wherefore, stand ye in holy places, and be not

47
00:04:49,582 --> 00:04:56,582
 moved, until the day of the Lord come; for behold,

48
00:04:56,582 --> 00:05:03,582
 it cometh quickly, saith the Lord. Amen.
