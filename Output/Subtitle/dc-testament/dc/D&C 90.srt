Prophet, given at Kirtland, Ohio, March 8, 1833. This

00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
revelation is a continuing step in the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
establishment of the First Presidency (see the 
heading

00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0

counselors mentioned were ordained on March 18,

00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0

6–7, Sidney Rigdon and Frederick G. Williams are

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
to serve in the First Presidency;

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
gospel is to be preached to the nations of Israel,

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
to the Gentiles, and to the Jews, every man

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
hearing in his own tongue; 
12–18, Joseph Smith and

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
his counselors are to set the Church in order;

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
19–37, Various individuals are counseled by the

16
00:00:00,0 --> 02:06:48,
Lord to walk uprightly and serve in His kingdom. 

17
02:06:48,0 --> 02:06:48,0
1 Thus saith the Lord, verily, verily I say

18
02:06:48,0 --> 02:06:48,0
unto you my son, thy sins are forgiven thee,

19
02:06:48,0 --> 02:06:48,0
according to thy petition, for thy prayers and the

20
02:06:48,0 --> 02:07:52,
prayers of thy brethren have come up into my ears.

21
02:07:52,0 --> 02:07:52,0
2 Therefore, thou art blessed from

22
02:07:52,0 --> 02:07:52,0
henceforth that bear the keys of the

23
02:07:52,0 --> 02:07:52,0
kingdom given unto you; which

24
02:07:52,0 --> 02:14:54,
kingdom is coming forth for the last time.

25
02:14:54,0 --> 02:14:54,0
3 Verily I say unto you, the keys

26
02:14:54,0 --> 02:14:54,0
of this kingdom shall never be

27
02:14:54,0 --> 02:14:54,0
taken from you, while thou art in the

28
02:14:54,0 --> 02:25:55,
world, neither in the world to come;

29
02:25:55,0 --> 02:25:55,0
4 Nevertheless, through you

30
02:25:55,0 --> 02:25:55,0
shall the oracles be given to

31
02:25:55,0 --> 02:30:59,
another, yea, even unto the church.

32
02:30:59,0 --> 02:30:59,0
5 And all they who receive

33
02:30:59,0 --> 02:30:59,0
the oracles of God, let them

34
02:30:59,0 --> 02:30:59,0
beware how they hold them

35
02:30:59,0 --> 02:30:59,0
lest they are accounted as a

36
02:30:59,0 --> 02:30:59,0
light thing, and are brought

37
02:30:59,0 --> 02:30:59,0
under condemnation thereby,

38
02:30:59,0 --> 02:30:59,0
and stumble and fall when

39
02:30:59,0 --> 02:30:59,0
the storms descend, and the

40
02:30:59,0 --> 02:30:59,0
winds blow, and the rains

41
02:30:59,0 --> 02:38:02,
descend, and beat upon their house.

42
02:38:02,0 --> 02:38:02,0
6 And again, verily I say

43
02:38:02,0 --> 02:38:02,0
unto thy brethren,

44
02:38:02,0 --> 02:38:02,0
Sidney Rigdon and Frederick G.

45
02:38:02,0 --> 02:38:02,0
Williams, their sins are

46
02:38:02,0 --> 02:38:02,0
forgiven them also, and

47
02:38:02,0 --> 02:38:02,0
they are accounted as

48
02:38:02,0 --> 02:38:02,0
equal with thee in holding

49
02:38:02,0 --> 02:49:40,
the keys of this last kingdom;

50
02:49:40,0 --> 02:49:40,0
7 As also through your

51
02:49:40,0 --> 02:49:40,0
administration the keys

52
02:49:40,0 --> 02:49:40,0
of the school of the

53
02:49:40,0 --> 02:49:40,0
prophets, which I have

54
02:49:40,0 --> 03:00:13,
commanded to be organized;

55
03:00:13,0 --> 03:00:13,0
8 That thereby they

56
03:00:13,0 --> 03:00:13,0
may be perfected in

57
03:00:13,0 --> 03:00:13,0
their ministry for the

58
03:00:13,0 --> 03:00:13,0
salvation of Zion, and of

59
03:00:13,0 --> 03:00:13,0
the nations of

60
03:00:13,0 --> 03:00:13,0
Israel, and of the Gentiles,

61
03:00:13,0 --> 03:11:13,
as many as will believe;

62
03:11:13,0 --> 03:11:13,0
9 That through your

63
03:11:13,0 --> 03:11:13,0
administration they

64
03:11:13,0 --> 03:11:13,0
may receive the

65
03:11:13,0 --> 03:11:13,0
word, and through their

66
03:11:13,0 --> 03:11:13,0
administration the

67
03:11:13,0 --> 03:11:13,0
word may go forth

68
03:11:13,0 --> 03:11:13,0
unto the ends of the

69
03:11:13,0 --> 03:11:13,0
earth, unto the

70
03:11:13,0 --> 03:11:13,0
Gentiles first, and then,

71
03:11:13,0 --> 03:11:13,0
behold, and lo, they

72
03:11:13,0 --> 03:31:48,
shall turn unto the Jews.

73
03:31:48,0 --> 03:31:48,0
10 And then cometh

74
03:31:48,0 --> 03:31:48,0
the day when the

75
03:31:48,0 --> 03:31:48,0
arm of the Lord

76
03:31:48,0 --> 03:31:48,0
shall be revealed in

77
03:31:48,0 --> 03:31:48,0
power in

78
03:31:48,0 --> 03:31:48,0
convincing the nations,

79
03:31:48,0 --> 03:31:48,0
the heathen nations,

80
03:31:48,0 --> 03:31:48,0
the house of

81
03:31:48,0 --> 03:31:48,0
Joseph, of the gospel

82
03:31:48,0 --> 03:58:47,
of their salvation.

83
03:58:47,0 --> 03:58:47,0
11 For it shall

84
03:58:47,0 --> 03:58:47,0
come to pass in

85
03:58:47,0 --> 03:58:47,0
that day, that

86
03:58:47,0 --> 03:58:47,0
every man shall hear

87
03:58:47,0 --> 03:58:47,0
the fulness of

88
03:58:47,0 --> 03:58:47,0
the gospel in his

89
03:58:47,0 --> 03:58:47,0
own tongue, and in

90
03:58:47,0 --> 03:58:47,0
his own

91
03:58:47,0 --> 03:58:47,0
language, through those

92
03:58:47,0 --> 03:58:47,0
who are ordained

93
03:58:47,0 --> 03:58:47,0
unto this power,

94
03:58:47,0 --> 03:58:47,0
by the

95
03:58:47,0 --> 03:58:47,0
administration of the

96
03:58:47,0 --> 03:58:47,0
Comforter, shed forth

97
03:58:47,0 --> 03:58:47,0
upon them for the

98
03:58:47,0 --> 04:10:53,
revelation of Jesus Christ.

99
04:10:53,0 --> 04:10:53,0
12 And now,

100
04:10:53,0 --> 04:10:53,0
verily I say unto

101
04:10:53,0 --> 04:10:53,0
you, I give unto

102
04:10:53,0 --> 04:10:53,0
you a commandment

103
04:10:53,0 --> 04:10:53,0
that you

104
04:10:53,0 --> 04:10:53,0
continue in the

105
04:10:53,0 --> 04:31:56,
ministry and presidency.

106
04:31:56,0 --> 04:31:56,0
13 And when you

107

have finished

108
04:31:56,0 --> 04:31:56,0

109
04:31:56,0 --> 04:31:56,0
the prophets,

110
04:31:56,0 --> 04:31:56,0
you shall from
