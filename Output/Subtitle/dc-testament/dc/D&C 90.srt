Section 90 Revelation to Joseph Smith the Prophet,

2
00:00:18,528 --> 00:00:25,778
 given at Kirtland, Ohio, March 8, 1833. This

3
00:00:25,778 --> 00:00:33,028
 revelation is a continuing step in the establishment

4
00:00:33,028 --> 00:00:40,278
 of the First Presidency (see the

00:00:40,278 --> 00:00:47,528
 section 81); as a consequence thereof, the counselors

6
00:00:47,528 --> 00:00:54,778
 mentioned were ordained on March 18, 1833. 
1–5, The

7
00:00:54,778 --> 00:01:02,028
 keys of the kingdom are committed to Joseph Smith

8
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:09,278
 and through him to the Church; 
6–7, Sidney

9
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:16,528
 Rigdon and Frederick G. Williams are to serve in the

10
00:01:16,528 --> 00:01:23,778
 First Presidency; 
8–11, The gospel is to be

11
00:01:23,778 --> 00:01:31,028
 preached to the nations of Israel, to the Gentiles, and

12
00:01:31,028 --> 00:01:38,278
 to the Jews, every man hearing in his own tongue;

13
00:01:38,278 --> 00:01:45,528
12–18, Joseph Smith and his counselors are to set

14
00:01:45,528 --> 00:01:52,778
 the Church in order; 
19–37, Various individuals

15
00:01:52,778 --> 00:02:00,028
 are counseled by the Lord to walk uprightly and

16
00:02:00,028 --> 00:02:07,278
 serve in His kingdom.

17
00:02:07,144 --> 00:02:11,894
1 Thus saith the Lord, verily, verily I say unto

18
00:02:11,894 --> 00:02:16,644
 you my son, thy sins are forgiven thee, according

19
00:02:16,644 --> 00:02:21,394
 to thy petition, for thy prayers and the prayers of

20
00:02:21,394 --> 00:02:26,144
 thy brethren have come up into my ears

21
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:30,413
2 Therefore, thou art blessed from henceforth that

22
00:02:30,413 --> 00:02:34,413
 bear the keys of the kingdom given unto you;

23
00:02:34,413 --> 00:02:38,413
 which kingdom is coming forth for the last time

24
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,959
3 Verily I say unto you, the keys of this kingdom

25
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,959
 shall never be taken from you, while thou art in

26
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,959
 the world, neither in the world to come

27
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:55,753
4 Nevertheless, through you shall the oracles be

28
00:02:55,753 --> 00:03:01,253
 given to another, yea, even unto the church

29
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:06,198
5 And all they who receive the oracles of God, let

30
00:03:06,198 --> 00:03:11,365
 them beware how they hold them lest they are

31
00:03:11,365 --> 00:03:16,532
 accounted as a light thing, and are brought under

32
00:03:16,532 --> 00:03:21,699
 condemnation thereby, and stumble and fall when the

33
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:26,866
 storms descend, and the winds blow, and the rains

34
00:03:26,866 --> 00:03:32,033
 descend, and beat upon their house

35
00:03:32,763 --> 00:03:38,163
6 And again, verily I say unto thy brethren,

36
00:03:38,163 --> 00:03:43,563
 Sidney Rigdon and Frederick G. Williams, their sins are

37
00:03:43,563 --> 00:03:48,963
 forgiven them also, and they are accounted as

38
00:03:48,963 --> 00:03:54,363
 equal with thee in holding the keys of this last

39
00:03:54,363 --> 00:03:59,763
 kingdom

40
00:03:59,756 --> 00:04:03,756
7 As also through your administration the keys of

41
00:04:03,756 --> 00:04:07,756
 the school of the prophets, which I have commanded

42
00:04:07,756 --> 00:04:11,756
 to be organized

43
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:17,252
8 That thereby they may be perfected in their

44
00:04:17,252 --> 00:04:22,752
 ministry for the salvation of Zion, and of the nations

45
00:04:22,752 --> 00:04:28,252
 of Israel, and of the Gentiles, as many as will

46
00:04:28,252 --> 00:04:33,752
 believe

47
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:37,707
9 That through your administration they may

48
00:04:37,707 --> 00:04:41,907
 receive the word, and through their administration the

49
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:46,107
 word may go forth unto the ends of the earth, unto

50
00:04:46,107 --> 00:04:50,307
 the Gentiles first, and then, behold, and lo, they

51
00:04:50,307 --> 00:04:54,507
 shall turn unto the Jews

52
00:04:54,511 --> 00:05:00,261
10 And then cometh the day when the arm of the

53
00:05:00,261 --> 00:05:06,011
 Lord shall be revealed in power in convincing the

54
00:05:06,011 --> 00:05:11,761
 nations, the heathen nations, the house of Joseph, of

55
00:05:11,761 --> 00:05:17,511
 the gospel of their salvation

56
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:22,85
11 For it shall come to pass in that day, that

57
00:05:22,85 --> 00:05:28,683
 every man shall hear the fulness of the gospel in his

58
00:05:28,683 --> 00:05:34,516
 own tongue, and in his own language, through

59
00:05:34,516 --> 00:05:40,349
 those who are ordained unto this power, by the

60
00:05:40,349 --> 00:05:46,182
 administration of the Comforter, shed forth upon them for

61
00:05:46,182 --> 00:05:52,015
 the revelation of Jesus Christ

62
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:56,351
12 And now, verily I say unto you, I give unto you

63
00:05:56,351 --> 00:06:00,684
 a commandment that you continue in the ministry

64
00:06:00,684 --> 00:06:05,017
 and presidency

65
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:09,698
13 And when you have finished the translation of

66
00:06:09,698 --> 00:06:14,365
 the prophets, you shall from thenceforth preside

67
00:06:14,365 --> 00:06:19,032
 over the affairs of the church and the school

68
00:06:19,329 --> 00:06:23,662
14 And from time to time, as shall be manifested

69
00:06:23,662 --> 00:06:27,995
 by the Comforter, receive revelations to unfold the

70
00:06:27,995 --> 00:06:32,328
 mysteries of the kingdom

71
00:06:32,609 --> 00:06:39,942
15 And set in order the churches, and study and

72
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:47,275
 learn, and become acquainted with all good books,

73
00:06:47,275 --> 00:06:54,608
 and with languages, tongues, and people

74
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:59,447
16 And this shall be your business and mission in

75
00:06:59,447 --> 00:07:04,78
 all your lives, to preside in council, and set in

76
00:07:04,78 --> 00:07:10,113
 order all the affairs of this church and kingdom

77
00:07:10,647 --> 00:07:15,314
17 Be not ashamed, neither confounded; but be

78
00:07:15,314 --> 00:07:19,981
 admonished in all your high-mindedness and pride, for

79
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:24,648
 it bringeth a snare upon your souls

80
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:30,644
18 Set in order your houses; keep slothfulness and

81
00:07:30,644 --> 00:07:36,644
 uncleanness far from you

82
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:40,656
19 Now, verily I say unto you, let there be a

83
00:07:40,656 --> 00:07:45,156
 place provided, as soon as it is possible, for the

84
00:07:45,156 --> 00:07:49,656
 family of thy counselor and scribe, even Frederick G.

85
00:07:49,656 --> 00:07:54,156
 Williams

86
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:59,441
20 And let mine aged servant, Joseph Smith, Sen.,

87
00:07:59,441 --> 00:08:03,941
 continue with his family upon the place where he

88
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:08,441
 now lives; and let it not be sold until the mouth

89
00:08:08,441 --> 00:08:12,941
 of the Lord shall name

90
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:17,376
21 And let my counselor, even Sidney Rigdon,

91
00:08:17,376 --> 00:08:22,043
 remain where he now resides until the mouth of the Lord

92
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:26,71
 shall name

93
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:31,14
22 And let the bishop search diligently to obtain

94
00:08:31,14 --> 00:08:35,807
 an agent, and let him be a man who has got riches

95
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:40,474
 in store—a man of God, and of strong faith

96
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:43,987
23 That thereby he may be enabled to discharge

97
00:08:43,987 --> 00:08:46,987
 every debt; that the storehouse of the Lord may not

98
00:08:46,987 --> 00:08:49,987
 be brought into disrepute before the eyes of the

99
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,987
 people

100
00:08:52,982 --> 00:08:58,232
24 Search diligently, pray always, and be

101
00:08:58,232 --> 00:09:03,482
 believing, and all things shall work together for your

102
00:09:03,482 --> 00:09:08,732
 good, if ye walk uprightly and remember the covenant

103
00:09:08,732 --> 00:09:13,982
 wherewith ye have covenanted one with another

104
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:21,987
25 Let your families be small, especially mine

105
00:09:21,987 --> 00:09:29,987
 aged servant Joseph Smith’s, Sen., as pertaining to

106
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:37,987
 those who do not belong to your families

107
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,91
26 That those things that are provided for you, to

108
00:09:40,91 --> 00:09:44,577
 bring to pass my work, be not taken from you and

109
00:09:44,577 --> 00:09:48,244
 given to those that are not worthy

110
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:52,254
27 And thereby you be hindered in accomplishing

111
00:09:52,254 --> 00:09:56,254
 those things which I have commanded you

112
00:09:56,563 --> 00:10:00,813
28 And again, verily I say unto you, it is my will

113
00:10:00,813 --> 00:10:05,063
 that my handmaid Vienna Jaques should receive

114
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:09,313
 money to bear her expenses, and go up unto the land

115
00:10:09,313 --> 00:10:13,563
 of Zion

116
00:10:13,096 --> 00:10:15,763
29 And the residue of the money may be consecrated

117
00:10:15,763 --> 00:10:18,43
 unto me, and she be rewarded in mine own due

118
00:10:18,43 --> 00:10:21,097
 time

119
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:24,638
30 Verily I say unto you, that it is meet in mine

120
00:10:24,638 --> 00:10:27,388
 eyes that she should go up unto the land of Zion,

121
00:10:27,388 --> 00:10:30,138
 and receive an inheritance from the hand of the

122
00:10:30,138 --> 00:10:32,888
 bishop

123
00:10:32,415 --> 00:10:36,082
31 That she may settle down in peace inasmuch as

124
00:10:36,082 --> 00:10:39,749
 she is faithful, and not be idle in her days from

125
00:10:39,749 --> 00:10:43,416
 thenceforth

126
00:10:43,927 --> 00:10:47,727
32 And behold, verily I say unto you, that ye

127
00:10:47,727 --> 00:10:51,527
 shall write this commandment, and say unto your

128
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:55,327
 brethren in Zion, in love greeting, that I have called

129
00:10:55,327 --> 00:10:59,127
 you also to preside over Zion in mine own due time

130
00:10:59,127 --> 00:11:02,927


131
00:11:02,712 --> 00:11:05,212
33 Therefore, let them cease wearying me

132
00:11:05,212 --> 00:11:07,712
 concerning this matter

133
00:11:07,25 --> 00:11:10,917
34 Behold, I say unto you that your brethren in

134
00:11:10,917 --> 00:11:14,584
 Zion begin to repent, and the angels rejoice over

135
00:11:14,584 --> 00:11:18,251
 them

136
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:22,861
35 Nevertheless, I am not well pleased with many

137
00:11:22,861 --> 00:11:27,461
 things; and I am not well pleased with my servant

138
00:11:27,461 --> 00:11:32,061
 William E. McLellin, neither with my servant Sidney

139
00:11:32,061 --> 00:11:36,661
 Gilbert; and the bishop also, and others have

140
00:11:36,661 --> 00:11:41,261
 many things to repent of

141
00:11:41,751 --> 00:11:46,001
36 But verily I say unto you, that I, the Lord,

142
00:11:46,001 --> 00:11:50,251
 will contend with Zion, and plead with her strong

143
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:54,501
 ones, and chasten her until she overcomes and is

144
00:11:54,501 --> 00:11:58,751
 clean before me

145
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:03,785
37 For she shall not be removed out of her place.

146
00:12:03,785 --> 00:12:08,785
 I, the Lord, have spoken it. Amen.
