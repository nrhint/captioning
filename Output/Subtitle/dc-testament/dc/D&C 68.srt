Section 68 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Prophet, at Hiram, Ohio, November 1, 1831,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
in response to prayer that the mind of the Lord

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
be made known concerning Orson Hyde, Luke S.

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Although part of this revelation was directed

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
toward these four men, much of the content

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
pertains to the whole Church. This revelation was

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
expanded under Joseph Smith’s direction when it was

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0

11

1–5, The words of the elders when

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0

6–12, Elders are to preach and baptize, and signs

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0

00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
among the sons of Aaron may serve as the

16
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Presiding Bishop (that is, hold the keys of presidency

17
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
as a bishop) under the direction of the First

18
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Presidency;

teach the gospel to their children; 
29–35, The

20
00:00:00,0 --> 02:19:22,
Saints are to observe the Sabbath, labor diligently, and pray. 

21
02:19:22,0 --> 02:19:22,0
1 My servant, Orson Hyde, was called by his

22
02:19:22,0 --> 02:19:22,0
ordination to proclaim the everlasting gospel, by

23
02:19:22,0 --> 02:19:22,0
the Spirit of the living God, from people to

24
02:19:22,0 --> 02:19:22,0
people, and from land to land, in the

25
02:19:22,0 --> 02:19:22,0
congregations of the wicked, in their synagogues,

26
02:19:22,0 --> 02:41:25,
reasoning with and expounding all scriptures unto them.

27
02:41:25,0 --> 02:41:25,0
2 And, behold, and lo, this is an

28
02:41:25,0 --> 02:41:25,0
ensample unto all those who were

29
02:41:25,0 --> 02:41:25,0
ordained unto this priesthood, whose

30
02:41:25,0 --> 02:48:28,
mission is appointed unto them to go forth—

31
02:48:28,0 --> 02:48:28,0
3 And this is the ensample unto

32
02:48:28,0 --> 02:48:28,0
them, that they shall speak as

33
02:48:28,0 --> 02:44:08,
they are moved upon by the Holy Ghost.

34
02:44:08,0 --> 02:44:08,0
4 And whatsoever they shall

35
02:44:08,0 --> 02:44:08,0
speak when moved upon by the Holy

36
02:44:08,0 --> 02:44:08,0
Ghost shall be scripture, shall

37
02:44:08,0 --> 02:44:08,0
be the will of the Lord, shall

38
02:44:08,0 --> 02:44:08,0
be the mind of the Lord, shall

39
02:44:08,0 --> 02:44:08,0
be the word of the Lord, shall

40
02:44:08,0 --> 02:44:08,0
be the voice of the Lord, and

41
02:44:08,0 --> 02:49:13,
the power of God unto salvation.

42
02:49:13,0 --> 02:49:13,0
5 Behold, this is the

43
02:49:13,0 --> 02:49:13,0
promise of the Lord unto

44
02:49:13,0 --> 03:08:50,
you, O ye my servants.

45
03:08:50,0 --> 03:08:50,0
6 Wherefore, be of

46
03:08:50,0 --> 03:08:50,0
good cheer, and do not

47

fear, for I the Lord

48
03:08:50,0 --> 03:08:50,0
am with you, and will

49
03:08:50,0 --> 03:08:50,0

03:08:50,0 --> 03:08:50,0
Christ, that I am the Son

53
03:08:50,0 --> 03:08:50,0
of the living God,

54
03:08:50,0 --> 03:08:50,0
that I was, that I am,

55
03:08:50,0 --> 03:15:53,
and that I am to come.

56
03:15:53,0 --> 03:15:53,0
7 This is the word

57
03:15:53,0 --> 03:15:53,0
of the Lord unto you,

58
03:15:53,0 --> 03:15:53,0
