1
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:17,912
Section 68 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:17,912 --> 00:00:24,312
 the Prophet, at Hiram, Ohio, November 1, 1831, in

3
00:00:24,312 --> 00:00:30,712
 response to prayer that the mind of the Lord be

4
00:00:30,712 --> 00:00:37,111
 made known concerning Orson Hyde, Luke S. Johnson,

5
00:00:37,111 --> 00:00:43,511
 Lyman E. Johnson, and William E. McLellin. Although

6
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:49,912
 part of this revelation was directed toward these

7
00:00:49,912 --> 00:00:56,312
 four men, much of the content pertains to the

8
00:00:56,312 --> 00:01:02,712
 whole Church. This revelation was expanded under

9
00:01:02,712 --> 00:01:09,112
 Joseph Smith’s direction when it was published in the

10
00:01:09,112 --> 00:01:15,511
 1835 edition of the Doctrine and Covenants. 
1–5,

11
00:01:15,511 --> 00:01:21,912
 The words of the elders when moved upon by the Holy

12
00:01:21,912 --> 00:01:28,312
 Ghost are scripture; 
6–12, Elders are to preach

13
00:01:28,312 --> 00:01:34,712
 and baptize, and signs will follow true believers;

14
00:01:34,712 --> 00:01:41,112
13–24, The firstborn among the sons of Aaron may

15
00:01:41,112 --> 00:01:47,511
 serve as the Presiding Bishop (that is, hold the

16
00:01:47,511 --> 00:01:53,912
 keys of presidency as a bishop) under the

17
00:01:53,912 --> 00:02:00,312
 direction of the First Presidency; 
25–28, Parents are

18
00:02:00,312 --> 00:02:06,712
 commanded to teach the gospel to their children;

19
00:02:06,712 --> 00:02:13,112
29–35, The Saints are to observe the Sabbath, labor

20
00:02:13,112 --> 00:02:19,512
 diligently, and pray.

21
00:02:19,856 --> 00:02:25,023
1 My servant, Orson Hyde, was called by his

22
00:02:25,023 --> 00:02:30,19
 ordination to proclaim the everlasting gospel, by the

23
00:02:30,19 --> 00:02:35,357
 Spirit of the living God, from people to people, and

24
00:02:35,357 --> 00:02:40,524
 from land to land, in the congregations of the

25
00:02:40,524 --> 00:02:45,691
 wicked, in their synagogues, reasoning with and

26
00:02:45,691 --> 00:02:50,858
 expounding all scriptures unto them

27
00:02:50,354 --> 00:02:56,687
2 And, behold, and lo, this is an ensample unto

28
00:02:56,687 --> 00:03:03,02
 all those who were ordained unto this priesthood,

29
00:03:03,02 --> 00:03:09,353
 whose mission is appointed unto them to go forth

30
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:12,122
3 And this is the ensample unto them, that they

31
00:03:12,122 --> 00:03:15,122
 shall speak as they are moved upon by the Holy

32
00:03:15,122 --> 00:03:18,122
 Ghost

33
00:03:18,415 --> 00:03:22,815
4 And whatsoever they shall speak when moved upon

34
00:03:22,815 --> 00:03:27,215
 by the Holy Ghost shall be scripture, shall be the

35
00:03:27,215 --> 00:03:31,615
 will of the Lord, shall be the mind of the Lord,

36
00:03:31,615 --> 00:03:36,015
 shall be the word of the Lord, shall be the voice

37
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:40,415
 of the Lord, and the power of God unto salvation

38
00:03:40,404 --> 00:03:44,904
5 Behold, this is the promise of the Lord unto

39
00:03:44,904 --> 00:03:49,404
 you, O ye my servants

40
00:03:49,93 --> 00:03:56,33
6 Wherefore, be of good cheer, and do not fear,

41
00:03:56,33 --> 00:04:02,73
 for I the Lord am with you, and will stand by you;

42
00:04:02,73 --> 00:04:09,13
 and ye shall bear record of me, even Jesus Christ,

43
00:04:09,13 --> 00:04:15,53
 that I am the Son of the living God, that I was,

44
00:04:15,53 --> 00:04:21,93
 that I am, and that I am to come

45
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:25,978
7 This is the word of the Lord unto you, my

46
00:04:25,978 --> 00:04:30,778
 servant Orson Hyde, and also unto my servant Luke

47
00:04:30,778 --> 00:04:35,578
 Johnson, and unto my servant Lyman Johnson, and unto my

48
00:04:35,578 --> 00:04:40,378
 servant William E. McLellin, and unto all the

49
00:04:40,378 --> 00:04:45,178
 faithful elders of my church

50
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:50,152
8 Go ye into all the world, preach the gospel to

51
00:04:50,152 --> 00:04:55,152
 every creature, acting in the authority which I

52
00:04:55,152 --> 00:05:00,152
 have given you, baptizing in the name of the Father,

53
00:05:00,152 --> 00:05:05,152
 and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost

54
00:05:05,689 --> 00:05:10,189
9 And he that believeth and is baptized shall be

55
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:14,689
 saved, and he that believeth not shall be damned

56
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:19,714
10 And he that believeth shall be blest with signs

57
00:05:19,714 --> 00:05:24,714
 following, even as it is written

58
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:28,574
11 And unto you it shall be given to know the

59
00:05:28,574 --> 00:05:32,907
 signs of the times, and the signs of the coming of the

60
00:05:32,907 --> 00:05:37,24
 Son of Man

61
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:44,421
12 And of as many as the Father shall bear record,

62
00:05:44,421 --> 00:05:51,088
 to you shall be given power to seal them up unto

63
00:05:51,088 --> 00:05:57,755
 eternal life. Amen

64
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:03,274
13 And now, concerning the items in addition to

65
00:06:03,274 --> 00:06:08,774
 the covenants and commandments, they are these

66
00:06:08,552 --> 00:06:13,219
14 There remain hereafter, in the due time of the

67
00:06:13,219 --> 00:06:17,886
 Lord, other bishops to be set apart unto the

68
00:06:17,886 --> 00:06:22,553
 church, to minister even according to the first

69
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:27,065
15 Wherefore they shall be high priests who are

70
00:06:27,065 --> 00:06:31,815
 worthy, and they shall be appointed by the First

71
00:06:31,815 --> 00:06:36,565
 Presidency of the Melchizedek Priesthood, except they

72
00:06:36,565 --> 00:06:41,315
 be literal descendants of Aaron

73
00:06:41,585 --> 00:06:46,585
16 And if they be literal descendants of Aaron

74
00:06:46,585 --> 00:06:51,585
 they have a legal right to the bishopric, if they are

75
00:06:51,585 --> 00:06:56,585
 the firstborn among the sons of Aaron

76
00:06:56,583 --> 00:07:00,916
17 For the firstborn holds the right of the

77
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:05,249
 presidency over this priesthood, and the keys or

78
00:07:05,249 --> 00:07:09,582
 authority of the same

79
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:15,863
18 No man has a legal right to this office, to

80
00:07:15,863 --> 00:07:21,863
 hold the keys of this priesthood, except he be a

81
00:07:21,863 --> 00:07:27,863
 literal descendant and the firstborn of Aaron

82
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:33,15
19 But, as a high priest of the Melchizedek

83
00:07:33,15 --> 00:07:38,436
 Priesthood has authority to officiate in all the lesser

84
00:07:38,436 --> 00:07:43,722
 offices he may officiate in the office of bishop

85
00:07:43,722 --> 00:07:49,008
 when no literal descendant of Aaron can be found,

86
00:07:49,008 --> 00:07:54,294
 provided he is called and set apart and ordained

87
00:07:54,294 --> 00:07:59,58
 unto this power, under the hands of the First

88
00:07:59,58 --> 00:08:04,866
 Presidency of the Melchizedek Priesthood

89
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:09,451
20 And a literal descendant of Aaron, also, must

90
00:08:09,451 --> 00:08:14,051
 be designated by this Presidency, and found worthy,

91
00:08:14,051 --> 00:08:18,651
 and anointed, and ordained under the hands of

92
00:08:18,651 --> 00:08:23,251
 this Presidency, otherwise they are not legally

93
00:08:23,251 --> 00:08:27,851
 authorized to officiate in their priesthood

94
00:08:27,357 --> 00:08:33,19
21 But, by virtue of the decree concerning their

95
00:08:33,19 --> 00:08:39,023
 right of the priesthood descending from father to

96
00:08:39,023 --> 00:08:44,856
 son, they may claim their anointing if at any time

97
00:08:44,856 --> 00:08:50,689
 they can prove their lineage, or do ascertain it

98
00:08:50,689 --> 00:08:56,522
 by revelation from the Lord under the hands of the

99
00:08:56,522 --> 00:09:02,355
 above named Presidency

100
00:09:02,358 --> 00:09:08,358
22 And again, no bishop or high priest who shall

101
00:09:08,358 --> 00:09:14,358
 be set apart for this ministry shall be tried or

102
00:09:14,358 --> 00:09:20,358
 condemned for any crime, save it be before the First

103
00:09:20,358 --> 00:09:26,358
 Presidency of the church

104
00:09:26,883 --> 00:09:30,55
23 And inasmuch as he is found guilty before this

105
00:09:30,55 --> 00:09:34,217
 Presidency, by testimony that cannot be impeached,

106
00:09:34,217 --> 00:09:37,884
 he shall be condemned

107
00:09:37,894 --> 00:09:41,561
24 And if he repent he shall be forgiven,

108
00:09:41,561 --> 00:09:45,228
 according to the covenants and commandments of the church

109
00:09:45,228 --> 00:09:48,895


110
00:09:48,905 --> 00:09:53,905
25 And again, inasmuch as parents have children in

111
00:09:53,905 --> 00:09:58,905
 Zion, or in any of her stakes which are

112
00:09:58,905 --> 00:10:03,905
 organized, that teach them not to understand the doctrine

113
00:10:03,905 --> 00:10:08,905
 of repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the

114
00:10:08,905 --> 00:10:13,905
 living God, and of baptism and the gift of the Holy

115
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:18,905
 Ghost by the laying on of the hands, when eight years

116
00:10:18,905 --> 00:10:23,905
 old, the sin be upon the heads of the parents

117
00:10:23,89 --> 00:10:27,89
26 For this shall be a law unto the inhabitants of

118
00:10:27,89 --> 00:10:31,89
 Zion, or in any of her stakes which are

119
00:10:31,89 --> 00:10:35,89
 organized

120
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:39,068
27 And their children shall be baptized for the

121
00:10:39,068 --> 00:10:42,735
 remission of their sins when eight years old, and

122
00:10:42,735 --> 00:10:46,402
 receive the laying on of the hands

123
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:51,912
28 And they shall also teach their children to

124
00:10:51,912 --> 00:10:57,412
 pray, and to walk uprightly before the Lord

125
00:10:57,19 --> 00:11:01,19
29 And the inhabitants of Zion shall also observe

126
00:11:01,19 --> 00:11:05,19
 the Sabbath day to keep it holy

127
00:11:05,982 --> 00:11:11,232
30 And the inhabitants of Zion also shall remember

128
00:11:11,232 --> 00:11:16,482
 their labors, inasmuch as they are appointed to

129
00:11:16,482 --> 00:11:21,732
 labor, in all faithfulness; for the idler shall be

130
00:11:21,732 --> 00:11:26,982
 had in remembrance before the Lord

131
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:32,353
31 Now, I, the Lord, am not well pleased with the

132
00:11:32,353 --> 00:11:37,953
 inhabitants of Zion, for there are idlers among

133
00:11:37,953 --> 00:11:43,553
 them; and their children are also growing up in

134
00:11:43,553 --> 00:11:49,153
 wickedness; they also seek not earnestly the riches of

135
00:11:49,153 --> 00:11:54,753
 eternity, but their eyes are full of greediness

136
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:58,247
32 These things ought not to be, and must be done

137
00:11:58,247 --> 00:12:02,247
 away from among them; wherefore, let my servant

138
00:12:02,247 --> 00:12:06,247
 Oliver Cowdery carry these sayings unto the land of

139
00:12:06,247 --> 00:12:10,247
 Zion

140
00:12:10,23 --> 00:12:14,23
33 And a commandment I give unto them—that he that

141
00:12:14,23 --> 00:12:18,23
 observeth not his prayers before the Lord in the

142
00:12:18,23 --> 00:12:22,23
 season thereof, let him be had in remembrance

143
00:12:22,23 --> 00:12:26,23
 before the judge of my people

144
00:12:26,763 --> 00:12:32,763
34 These sayings are true and faithful; wherefore,

145
00:12:32,763 --> 00:12:38,763
 transgress them not, neither take therefrom

146
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:44,024
35 Behold, I am Alpha and Omega, and I come

147
00:12:44,024 --> 00:12:49,524
 quickly. Amen.
