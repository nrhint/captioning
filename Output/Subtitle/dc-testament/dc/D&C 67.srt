1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
section 1 had been received, some

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
conversation was had concerning the language used in the

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
revelations. The present revelation

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
followed. 
1–3, The Lord hears the prayers of and

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
watches over His elders; 
4–9, He challenges the

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
wisest person to duplicate the least of His

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
revelations; 
10–14, Faithful elders will be

8
00:00:00,0 --> 03:02:41,
quickened by the Spirit and see the face of God. 

9
03:02:41,0 --> 03:02:41,0
1 Behold and hearken, O ye elders of

10
03:02:41,0 --> 03:02:41,0
my church, who have assembled

11
03:02:41,0 --> 03:02:41,0
yourselves together, whose prayers I have

12
03:02:41,0 --> 03:02:41,0
heard, and whose hearts I know, and

13
03:02:41,0 --> 03:22:18,
whose desires have come up before me.

14
03:22:18,0 --> 03:22:18,0
2 Behold and lo, mine eyes are

15
03:22:18,0 --> 03:22:18,0
upon you, and the heavens and the

16
03:22:18,0 --> 03:22:18,0
earth are in mine hands, and the

17
03:22:18,0 --> 03:40:20,
riches of eternity are mine to give.

18
03:40:20,0 --> 03:40:20,0
3 Ye endeavored to believe

19
03:40:20,0 --> 03:40:20,0
that ye should receive the

20
03:40:20,0 --> 03:40:20,0
blessing which was offered unto you;

21
03:40:20,0 --> 03:40:20,0
but behold, verily I say unto

22
03:40:20,0 --> 03:40:20,0
you there were fears in your

23
03:40:20,0 --> 03:40:20,0
hearts, and verily this is the

24
03:40:20,0 --> 04:08:24,
reason that ye did not receive.

25
04:08:24,0 --> 04:08:24,0
4 And now I, the Lord, give

26
04:08:24,0 --> 04:08:24,0
unto you a testimony of

27
04:08:24,0 --> 04:08:24,0
the truth of these

28
04:08:24,0 --> 04:07:28,
commandments which are lying before you.

29
04:07:28,0 --> 04:07:28,0
5 Your eyes have been upon

30
04:07:28,0 --> 04:07:28,0
my servant Joseph Smith,

31
04:07:28,0 --> 04:07:28,0
Jun., and his language you

32
04:07:28,0 --> 04:07:28,0
have known, and his

33
04:07:28,0 --> 04:07:28,0
imperfections you have known;

34
04:07:28,0 --> 04:07:28,0
and you have sought in your

35
04:07:28,0 --> 04:07:28,0
hearts knowledge that you

36
04:07:28,0 --> 04:07:28,0
might express beyond his

37
04:07:28,0 --> 04:09:32,
language; this you also know.

38
04:09:32,0 --> 04:09:32,0
6 Now, seek ye out of

39
04:09:32,0 --> 04:09:32,0
the Book of

40
04:09:32,0 --> 04:09:32,0
Commandments, even the least

41
04:09:32,0 --> 04:09:32,0
that is among them,

42
04:09:32,0 --> 04:09:32,0
and appoint him that

43
04:09:32,0 --> 04:23:36,
is the most wise among you;

44
04:23:36,0 --> 04:23:36,0
7 Or, if there be

45
04:23:36,0 --> 04:23:36,0
any among you that

46
04:23:36,0 --> 04:23:36,0
shall make one like

47
04:23:36,0 --> 04:23:36,0
unto it, then ye

48
04:23:36,0 --> 04:23:36,0
are justified in

49
04:23:36,0 --> 04:23:36,0
saying that ye do not

50
04:23:36,0 --> 04:52:38,
know that they are true;

51
04:52:38,0 --> 04:52:38,0
8 But if ye cannot

52
04:52:38,0 --> 04:52:38,0
make one like

53
04:52:38,0 --> 04:52:38,0
unto it, ye are under

54
04:52:38,0 --> 04:52:38,0
condemnation if

55
04:52:38,0 --> 04:52:38,0
ye do not bear

56
04:52:38,0 --> 05:10:40,
record that they are true.

57
05:10:40,0 --> 05:10:40,0
9 For ye know

58
05:10:40,0 --> 05:10:40,0
that there is no

59
05:10:40,0 --> 05:10:40,0
unrighteousness

60
05:10:40,0 --> 05:10:40,0
in them, and that

61
05:10:40,0 --> 05:10:40,0
which is

62
05:10:40,0 --> 05:10:40,0
righteous cometh down

63
05:10:40,0 --> 05:10:40,0
from above, from

64
05:10:40,0 --> 05:12:44,
the Father of lights.

65
05:12:44,0 --> 05:12:44,0
10 And again,

66
05:12:44,0 --> 05:12:44,0
verily I say

67
05:12:44,0 --> 05:12:44,0
unto you that it

68
05:12:44,0 --> 05:12:44,0
is your

69
05:12:44,0 --> 05:12:44,0
privilege, and a

70
05:12:44,0 --> 05:12:44,0
promise I give unto

71
05:12:44,0 --> 05:12:44,0
you that have

72
05:12:44,0 --> 05:12:44,0
been ordained

73
05:12:44,0 --> 05:12:44,0
unto this

74
05:12:44,0 --> 05:12:44,0
ministry, that inasmuch

75
05:12:44,0 --> 05:12:44,0
as you strip

76
05:12:44,0 --> 05:12:44,0
yourselves from

77
05:12:44,0 --> 05:12:44,0
jealousies and

78
05:12:44,0 --> 05:12:44,0
fears, and

79
05:12:44,0 --> 05:12:44,0
humble yourselves

80
05:12:44,0 --> 05:12:44,0
before me, for

81
05:12:44,0 --> 05:12:44,0
ye are not

82
05:12:44,0 --> 05:12:44,0
sufficiently humble,

83
05:12:44,0 --> 05:12:44,0
the veil shall

84
05:12:44,0 --> 05:12:44,0
be rent and

85
05:12:44,0 --> 05:12:44,0
you shall see me

86
05:12:44,0 --> 05:12:44,0
and know that I

87
05:12:44,0 --> 05:12:44,0
am—not with

88
05:12:44,0 --> 05:12:44,0
the carnal

89
05:12:44,0 --> 05:14:48,
neither natural mind, but with the spiritual.

90
05:14:48,0 --> 05:14:48,0
11 For no man

91
05:14:48,0 --> 05:14:48,0
has seen God

92
05:14:48,0 --> 05:14:48,0
at any time

93
05:14:48,0 --> 05:14:48,0
in the flesh,

94
05:14:48,0 --> 05:14:48,0
except

95
05:14:48,0 --> 05:14:48,0
quickened by the

96
05:14:48,0 --> 05:36:51,
Spirit of God.

97
05:36:51,0 --> 05:36:51,0
12 Neither

98
05:36:51,0 --> 05:36:51,0
can any

99
05:36:51,0 --> 05:36:51,0
natural man abide

100
05:36:51,0 --> 05:36:51,0
the

101
05:36:51,0 --> 05:36:51,0
presence of God,

102
05:36:51,0 --> 05:36:51,0
neither after

103
05:36:51,0 --> 05:55:50,
the carnal mind.

104
05:55:50,0 --> 05:55:50,0
13 Ye are

105
05:55:50,0 --> 05:55:50,0
not able to

106
05:55:50,0 --> 05:55:50,0
abide the

107
05:55:50,0 --> 05:55:50,0
presence of

108
05:55:50,0 --> 05:55:50,0
God now,

109
05:55:50,0 --> 05:55:50,0
neither the

110
05:55:50,0 --> 05:55:50,0
ministering

111
05:55:50,0 --> 05:55:50,0
of angels;

112
05:55:50,0 --> 05:55:50,0
wherefore,

113
05:55:50,0 --> 05:55:50,0
continue in

114
05:55:50,0 --> 05:55:50,0
patience

115
05:55:50,0 --> 05:58:52,
until ye are perfected.

116
05:58:52,0 --> 05:58:52,0
14 Let not

117
05:58:52,0 --> 05:58:52,0
your minds

118
05:58:52,0 --> 05:58:52,0
turn back;

119
05:58:52,0 --> 05:58:52,0
and when ye

120
05:58:52,0 --> 05:58:52,0
are

121
05:58:52,0 --> 05:58:52,0
worthy, in mine

122
05:58:52,0 --> 05:58:52,0
own due

123
05:58:52,0 --> 05:58:52,0
time, ye shall

124
05:58:52,0 --> 05:58:52,0
see and

125
05:58:52,0 --> 05:58:52,0
know that

126
05:58:52,0 --> 05:58:52,0
which was

127
05:58:52,0 --> 05:58:52,0
conferred upon

128
05:58:52,0 --> 05:58:52,0
you by the

129
05:58:52,0 --> 05:58:52,0
hands of my

130
05:58:52,0 --> 05:58:52,0
servant

131
05:58:52,0 --> 05:58:52,0
