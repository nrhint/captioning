1
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:32,778
section 1 had been received, some conversation was

2
00:00:32,778 --> 00:00:54,278
 had concerning the language used in the

3
00:00:54,278 --> 00:01:15,778
 revelations. The present revelation followed. 
1–3, The

4
00:01:15,778 --> 00:01:37,278
 Lord hears the prayers of and watches over His

5
00:01:37,278 --> 00:01:58,778
 elders; 
4–9, He challenges the wisest person to

6
00:01:58,778 --> 00:02:20,278
 duplicate the least of His revelations; 
10–14, Faithful

7
00:02:20,278 --> 00:02:41,778
 elders will be quickened by the Spirit and see the

8
00:02:41,778 --> 00:03:03,278
 face of God.

9
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:08,066
1 Behold and hearken, O ye elders of my church,

10
00:03:08,066 --> 00:03:12,816
 who have assembled yourselves together, whose

11
00:03:12,816 --> 00:03:17,566
 prayers I have heard, and whose hearts I know, and whose

12
00:03:17,566 --> 00:03:22,316
 desires have come up before me

13
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:29,152
2 Behold and lo, mine eyes are upon you, and the

14
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:35,485
 heavens and the earth are in mine hands, and the

15
00:03:35,485 --> 00:03:41,818
 riches of eternity are mine to give

16
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:46,921
3 Ye endeavored to believe that ye should receive

17
00:03:46,921 --> 00:03:52,721
 the blessing which was offered unto you; but

18
00:03:52,721 --> 00:03:58,521
 behold, verily I say unto you there were fears in your

19
00:03:58,521 --> 00:04:04,321
 hearts, and verily this is the reason that ye did

20
00:04:04,321 --> 00:04:10,121
 not receive

21
00:04:10,867 --> 00:04:15,534
4 And now I, the Lord, give unto you a testimony

22
00:04:15,534 --> 00:04:20,201
 of the truth of these commandments which are lying

23
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:24,868
 before you

24
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:30,865
5 Your eyes have been upon my servant Joseph

25
00:04:30,865 --> 00:04:36,865
 Smith, Jun., and his language you have known, and his

26
00:04:36,865 --> 00:04:42,865
 imperfections you have known; and you have sought

27
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:48,865
 in your hearts knowledge that you might express

28
00:04:48,865 --> 00:04:54,865
 beyond his language; this you also know

29
00:04:54,127 --> 00:05:01,127
6 Now, seek ye out of the Book of Commandments,

30
00:05:01,127 --> 00:05:08,127
 even the least that is among them, and appoint him

31
00:05:08,127 --> 00:05:15,127
 that is the most wise among you

32
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:23,048
7 Or, if there be any among you that shall make

33
00:05:23,048 --> 00:05:30,381
 one like unto it, then ye are justified in saying

34
00:05:30,381 --> 00:05:37,714
 that ye do not know that they are true

35
00:05:37,988 --> 00:05:45,321
8 But if ye cannot make one like unto it, ye are

36
00:05:45,321 --> 00:05:52,654
 under condemnation if ye do not bear record that

37
00:05:52,654 --> 00:05:59,987
 they are true

38
00:05:59,743 --> 00:06:08,41
9 For ye know that there is no unrighteousness in

39
00:06:08,41 --> 00:06:17,077
 them, and that which is righteous cometh down from

40
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:25,744
 above, from the Father of lights

41
00:06:25,502 --> 00:06:33,002
10 And again, verily I say unto you that it is

42
00:06:33,002 --> 00:06:40,502
 your privilege, and a promise I give unto you that

43
00:06:40,502 --> 00:06:48,002
 have been ordained unto this ministry, that inasmuch

44
00:06:48,002 --> 00:06:55,502
 as you strip yourselves from jealousies and

45
00:06:55,502 --> 00:07:03,002
 fears, and humble yourselves before me, for ye are not

46
00:07:03,002 --> 00:07:10,502
 sufficiently humble, the veil shall be rent and

47
00:07:10,502 --> 00:07:18,002
 you shall see me and know that I am—not with the

48
00:07:18,002 --> 00:07:25,502
 carnal neither natural mind, but with the spiritual

49
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:31,945
11 For no man has seen God at any time in the

50
00:07:31,945 --> 00:07:38,445
 flesh, except quickened by the Spirit of God

51
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:45,724
12 Neither can any natural man abide the presence

52
00:07:45,724 --> 00:07:53,224
 of God, neither after the carnal mind

53
00:07:53,823 --> 00:08:02,156
13 Ye are not able to abide the presence of God

54
00:08:02,156 --> 00:08:10,489
 now, neither the ministering of angels; wherefore,

55
00:08:10,489 --> 00:08:18,822
 continue in patience until ye are perfected

56
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:11,278
heading to section 1). William W. Phelps had

57
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:11,278
 recently established the Church printing press in

58
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:11,278
 Independence, Missouri. The conference decided to

59
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:11,278
 publish the revelations in the Book of Commandments and

60
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:11,278
 to print 10,000 copies (which because of

61
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:11,278
 unforeseen difficulties was later reduced to 3,000

62
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:11,278
 copies). Many of the brethren bore solemn testimony that

63
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:11,278
 the revelations then compiled for publication were

64
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:11,278
 verily true, as was witnessed by the Holy Ghost

65
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:11,278
 shed forth upon them. Joseph Smith’s history

66
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:11,278
 records that after the revelation known as

67
00:00:11,361 --> 00:00:09,528
Section 67 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

68
00:00:09,528 --> 00:00:07,695
 the Prophet, at Hiram, Ohio, early November 1831.

69
00:00:07,695 --> 00:00:05,862
 The occasion was that of a special conference, and

70
00:00:05,862 --> 00:00:04,029
 the publication of the revelations already

71
00:00:04,029 --> 00:00:02,196
 received from the Lord through the Prophet was considered

72
00:00:02,196 --> 00:00:00,363
 and acted upon (see the
