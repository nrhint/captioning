1
00:00:11,295 --> 00:00:19,137
Section 82 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:19,137 --> 00:00:26,979
 Prophet, in Independence, Jackson County, Missouri,

3
00:00:26,979 --> 00:00:34,821
 April 26, 1832. The occasion was a council of high

4
00:00:34,821 --> 00:00:42,663
 priests and elders of the Church. At the council,

5
00:00:42,663 --> 00:00:50,505
 Joseph Smith was sustained as the President of

6
00:00:50,505 --> 00:00:58,347
 the High Priesthood, to which office he had

7
00:00:58,347 --> 00:01:06,189
 previously been ordained at a conference of high priests,

8
00:01:06,189 --> 00:01:14,031
 elders, and members, at Amherst, Ohio, January 25,

9
00:01:14,031 --> 00:01:21,873
 1832 (see the 
heading to section 75). This

10
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:29,715
 revelation reiterates instructions given in an earlier

11
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:37,557
 revelation (
section 78) to establish a firm—known

12
00:01:37,557 --> 00:01:45,399
 as the United Firm (under Joseph Smith’s

13
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:53,241
 direction, the term “order” later replaced “firm”)—to

14
00:01:53,241 --> 00:02:01,083
 govern the Church’s mercantile and publishing

15
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:08,925
 endeavors. 
1–4, Where much is given, much is required;

16
00:02:08,925 --> 00:02:16,767
5–7, Darkness reigns in the world; 
8–13, The Lord

17
00:02:16,767 --> 00:02:24,609
 is bound when we do what He says; 
14–18, Zion

18
00:02:24,609 --> 00:02:32,451
 must increase in beauty and holiness; 
19–24, Every

19
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:40,293
 man should seek the interest of his neighbor.

20
00:02:40,16 --> 00:02:44,16
1 Verily, verily, I say unto you, my servants,

21
00:02:44,16 --> 00:02:48,16
 that inasmuch as you have forgiven one another your

22
00:02:48,16 --> 00:02:52,16
 trespasses, even so I, the Lord, forgive you

23
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:57,089
2 Nevertheless, there are those among you who have

24
00:02:57,089 --> 00:03:01,489
 sinned exceedingly; yea, even all of you have

25
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:05,889
 sinned; but verily I say unto you, beware from

26
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:10,289
 henceforth, and refrain from sin, lest sore judgments

27
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:14,689
 fall upon your heads

28
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:21,628
3 For of him unto whom much is given much is

29
00:03:21,628 --> 00:03:28,295
 required; and he who sins against the greater light

30
00:03:28,295 --> 00:03:34,962
 shall receive the greater condemnation

31
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:39,464
4 Ye call upon my name for revelations, and I give

32
00:03:39,464 --> 00:03:44,464
 them unto you; and inasmuch as ye keep not my

33
00:03:44,464 --> 00:03:49,464
 sayings, which I give unto you, ye become

34
00:03:49,464 --> 00:03:54,464
 transgressors; and justice and judgment are the penalty which

35
00:03:54,464 --> 00:03:59,464
 is affixed unto my law

36
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:07,306
5 Therefore, what I say unto one I say unto all:

37
00:04:07,306 --> 00:04:14,639
 Watch, for the adversary spreadeth his dominions,

38
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:21,972
 and darkness reigneth

39
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:26,178
6 And the anger of God kindleth against the

40
00:04:26,178 --> 00:04:30,845
 inhabitants of the earth; and none doeth good, for all

41
00:04:30,845 --> 00:04:35,512
 have gone out of the way

42
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:43,542
7 And now, verily I say unto you, I, the Lord,

43
00:04:43,542 --> 00:04:51,542
 will not lay any sin to your charge; go your ways and

44
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:59,542
 sin no more; but unto that soul who sinneth shall

45
00:04:59,542 --> 00:05:07,542
 the former sins return, saith the Lord your God

46
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:10,84
8 And again, I say unto you, I give unto you a new

47
00:05:10,84 --> 00:05:14,173
 commandment, that you may understand my will

48
00:05:14,173 --> 00:05:17,506
 concerning you

49
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:22,184
9 Or, in other words, I give unto you directions

50
00:05:22,184 --> 00:05:26,851
 how you may act before me, that it may turn to you

51
00:05:26,851 --> 00:05:31,518
 for your salvation

52
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:39,031
10 I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say;

53
00:05:39,031 --> 00:05:47,031
 but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise

54
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:53,124
11 Therefore, verily I say unto you, that it is

55
00:05:53,124 --> 00:05:59,235
 expedient for my servants Edward Partridge and

56
00:05:59,235 --> 00:06:05,346
 Newel K. Whitney, A. Sidney Gilbert and Sidney Rigdon,

57
00:06:05,346 --> 00:06:11,457
 and my servant Joseph Smith, and John Whitmer and

58
00:06:11,457 --> 00:06:17,568
 Oliver Cowdery, and W. W. Phelps and Martin Harris

59
00:06:17,568 --> 00:06:23,679
 to be bound together by a bond and covenant that

60
00:06:23,679 --> 00:06:29,79
 cannot be broken by transgression, except judgment

61
00:06:29,79 --> 00:06:35,901
 shall immediately follow, in your several

62
00:06:35,901 --> 00:06:42,012
 stewardships

63
00:06:42,953 --> 00:06:47,62
12 To manage the affairs of the poor, and all

64
00:06:47,62 --> 00:06:52,287
 things pertaining to the bishopric both in the land of

65
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:56,954
 Zion and in the land of Kirtland

66
00:06:56,0 --> 00:07:03,667
13 For I have consecrated the land of Kirtland in

67
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:10,334
 mine own due time for the benefit of the saints of

68
00:07:10,334 --> 00:07:17,001
 the Most High, and for a stake to Zion

69
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:23,269
14 For Zion must increase in beauty, and in

70
00:07:23,269 --> 00:07:30,269
 holiness; her borders must be enlarged; her stakes must

71
00:07:30,269 --> 00:07:37,269
 be strengthened; yea, verily I say unto you, Zion

72
00:07:37,269 --> 00:07:44,269
 must arise and put on her beautiful garments

73
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:48,88
15 Therefore, I give unto you this commandment,

74
00:07:48,88 --> 00:07:53,213
 that ye bind yourselves by this covenant, and it

75
00:07:53,213 --> 00:07:57,546
 shall be done according to the laws of the Lord

76
00:07:57,827 --> 00:08:01,327
16 Behold, here is wisdom also in me for your

77
00:08:01,327 --> 00:08:04,827
 good

78
00:08:04,601 --> 00:08:10,601
17 And you are to be equal, or in other words, you

79
00:08:10,601 --> 00:08:16,601
 are to have equal claims on the properties, for

80
00:08:16,601 --> 00:08:22,601
 the benefit of managing the concerns of your

81
00:08:22,601 --> 00:08:28,601
 stewardships, every man according to his wants and his

82
00:08:28,601 --> 00:08:34,601
 needs, inasmuch as his wants are just

83
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:41,414
18 And all this for the benefit of the church of

84
00:08:41,414 --> 00:08:48,247
 the living God, that every man may improve upon his

85
00:08:48,247 --> 00:08:55,08
 talent, that every man may gain other talents,

86
00:08:55,08 --> 00:09:01,913
 yea, even an hundred fold, to be cast into the

87
00:09:01,913 --> 00:09:08,746
 Lord’s storehouse, to become the common property of the

88
00:09:08,746 --> 00:09:15,579
 whole church

89
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:20,588
19 Every man seeking the interest of his neighbor,

90
00:09:20,588 --> 00:09:25,588
 and doing all things with an eye single to the

91
00:09:25,588 --> 00:09:30,588
 glory of God

92
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:35,103
20 This order I have appointed to be an

93
00:09:35,103 --> 00:09:40,103
 everlasting order unto you, and unto your successors,

94
00:09:40,103 --> 00:09:45,103
 inasmuch as you sin not

95
00:09:45,368 --> 00:09:49,768
21 And the soul that sins against this covenant,

96
00:09:49,768 --> 00:09:54,168
 and hardeneth his heart against it, shall be dealt

97
00:09:54,168 --> 00:09:58,568
 with according to the laws of my church, and shall

98
00:09:58,568 --> 00:10:02,968
 be delivered over to the buffetings of Satan

99
00:10:02,968 --> 00:10:07,368
 until the day of redemption

100
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:12,107
22 And now, verily I say unto you, and this is

101
00:10:12,107 --> 00:10:16,857
 wisdom, make unto yourselves friends with the mammon

102
00:10:16,857 --> 00:10:21,607
 of unrighteousness, and they will not destroy you

103
00:10:21,607 --> 00:10:26,357


104
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:30,026
23 Leave judgment alone with me, for it is mine

105
00:10:30,026 --> 00:10:33,693
 and I will repay. Peace be with you; my blessings

106
00:10:33,693 --> 00:10:37,36
 continue with you

107
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:44,804
24 For even yet the kingdom is yours, and shall be

108
00:10:44,804 --> 00:10:52,471
 forever, if you fall not from your steadfastness.

109
00:10:52,471 --> 00:11:00,138
 Even so. Amen.
