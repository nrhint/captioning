1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 82 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Prophet, in Independence, Jackson County,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Missouri, April 26, 1832. The occasion was a council of

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
high priests and elders of the Church. At the

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
council, Joseph Smith was sustained as the President

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of the High Priesthood, to which office he had

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
previously been ordained at a conference of high

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
priests, elders, and members, at Amherst, Ohio,

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
January 25, 1832 (see the 
heading to section 75).

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
This revelation reiterates instructions given in

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
an earlier revelation (
section 78) to establish a

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
firm—known as the United Firm (under Joseph

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Smith’s direction, the term “order” later replaced

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
“firm”)—to govern the Church’s mercantile and

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
publishing endeavors. 
1–4, Where much is given, much

16
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
is required; 
5–7, Darkness reigns in the world;

17
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
8–13, The Lord is bound when we do what He says;

18
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
14–18, Zion must increase in beauty and

19
00:00:00,0 --> 02:38:44,
holiness; 
19–24, Every man should seek the interest of his neighbor. 

20
02:38:44,0 --> 02:38:44,0
1 Verily, verily, I say unto you, my servants,

21
02:38:44,0 --> 02:38:44,0
that inasmuch as you have forgiven one another

22
02:38:44,0 --> 02:38:22,
your trespasses, even so I, the Lord, forgive you.

23
02:38:22,0 --> 02:38:22,0
2 Nevertheless, there are those among you

24
02:38:22,0 --> 02:38:22,0
who have sinned exceedingly; yea, even all

25
02:38:22,0 --> 02:38:22,0
of you have sinned; but verily I say unto

26
02:38:22,0 --> 02:38:22,0
you, beware from henceforth, and refrain from

27
02:38:22,0 --> 02:34:02,
sin, lest sore judgments fall upon your heads.

28
02:34:02,0 --> 02:34:02,0
3 For of him unto whom much is

29
02:34:02,0 --> 02:34:02,0
given much is required; and he who

30
02:34:02,0 --> 02:34:02,0
sins against the greater light shall

31
02:34:02,0 --> 02:39:07,
receive the greater condemnation.

32
02:39:07,0 --> 02:39:07,0
4 Ye call upon my name for

33
02:39:07,0 --> 02:39:07,0
revelations, and I give them unto

34
02:39:07,0 --> 02:39:07,0
you; and inasmuch as ye keep not my

35
02:39:07,0 --> 02:39:07,0
sayings, which I give unto you,

36
02:39:07,0 --> 02:39:07,0
ye become transgressors; and

37
02:39:07,0 --> 02:39:07,0
justice and judgment are the

38
02:39:07,0 --> 02:38:45,
penalty which is affixed unto my law.

39
02:38:45,0 --> 02:38:45,0
5 Therefore, what I say unto

40
02:38:45,0 --> 02:38:45,0
one I say unto all: Watch, for

41
02:38:45,0 --> 02:38:45,0
the adversary spreadeth his

42
02:38:45,0 --> 02:38:23,
dominions, and darkness reigneth;

43
02:38:23,0 --> 02:38:23,0
6 And the anger of God

44
02:38:23,0 --> 02:38:23,0
kindleth against the

45
02:38:23,0 --> 02:38:23,0
inhabitants of the earth;

46
02:38:23,0 --> 02:38:23,0
and none doeth good, for

47
02:38:23,0 --> 02:34:03,
all have gone out of the way.

48
02:34:03,0 --> 02:34:03,0
7 And now, verily I

49
02:34:03,0 --> 02:34:03,0
say unto you, I, the

50
02:34:03,0 --> 02:34:03,0
Lord, will not lay any

51
02:34:03,0 --> 02:34:03,0
sin to your charge; go

52
02:34:03,0 --> 02:34:03,0
your ways and sin no

53
02:34:03,0 --> 02:34:03,0
more; but unto that soul

54
02:34:03,0 --> 02:34:03,0
who sinneth shall the

55
02:34:03,0 --> 02:34:03,0
former sins return,

56
02:34:03,0 --> 02:39:08,
saith the Lord your God.

57
02:39:08,0 --> 02:39:08,0
8 And again, I say

58
02:39:08,0 --> 02:39:08,0
unto you, I give

59
02:39:08,0 --> 02:39:08,0
unto you a new

60
02:39:08,0 --> 02:39:08,0
commandment, that you

61
02:39:08,0 --> 02:39:08,0
may understand my

62
02:39:08,0 --> 02:38:46,
will concerning you;

63
02:38:46,0 --> 02:38:46,0
9 Or, in other

64
02:38:46,0 --> 02:38:46,0
words, I give unto

65
02:38:46,0 --> 02:38:46,0
you directions

66
02:38:46,0 --> 02:38:46,0
how you may act

67
02:38:46,0 --> 02:38:46,0
before me, that it

68
02:38:46,0 --> 02:38:46,0
may turn to you

69
02:38:46,0 --> 02:38:24,
for your salvation.

70
02:38:24,0 --> 02:38:24,0
10 I, the Lord,

71
02:38:24,0 --> 02:38:24,0
am bound when ye

72
02:38:24,0 --> 02:38:24,0
do what I say;

73
02:38:24,0 --> 02:38:24,0
but when ye do

74
02:38:24,0 --> 02:38:24,0
not what I say,

75
02:38:24,0 --> 02:34:04,
ye have no promise.

76
02:34:04,0 --> 02:34:04,0
11 Therefore,

77
02:34:04,0 --> 02:34:04,0
verily I say

78
02:34:04,0 --> 02:34:04,0
unto you, that it

79
02:34:04,0 --> 02:34:04,0
is expedient

80
02:34:04,0 --> 02:34:04,0
for my servants

81
02:34:04,0 --> 02:34:04,0
Edward Partridge

82
02:34:04,0 --> 02:34:04,0
and Newel K.

83
02:34:04,0 --> 02:34:04,0
Whitney,

84
02:34:04,0 --> 02:34:04,0
A. Sidney Gilbert and

85
02:34:04,0 --> 02:34:04,0
Sidney Rigdon,

86
02:34:04,0 --> 02:34:04,0
and my servant

87
02:34:04,0 --> 02:34:04,0
Joseph Smith,

88
02:34:04,0 --> 02:34:04,0
and John Whitmer

89
02:34:04,0 --> 02:34:04,0
and Oliver

90
02:34:04,0 --> 02:34:04,0
Cowdery, and W. W.

91
02:34:04,0 --> 02:34:04,0
Phelps and

92
02:34:04,0 --> 02:34:04,0
Martin Harris to

93
02:34:04,0 --> 02:34:04,0
be bound

94
02:34:04,0 --> 02:34:04,0
together by a bond and

95
02:34:04,0 --> 02:34:04,0
covenant that

96
02:34:04,0 --> 02:34:04,0
cannot be

97
02:34:04,0 --> 02:34:04,0
broken by

98
02:34:04,0 --> 02:34:04,0
transgression, except

99
02:34:04,0 --> 02:34:04,0
judgment shall

100
02:34:04,0 --> 02:34:04,0
immediately

101
02:34:04,0 --> 02:39:09,
follow, in your several stewardships—

102
02:39:09,0 --> 02:39:09,0
12 To manage

103
02:39:09,0 --> 02:39:09,0
the affairs of

104
02:39:09,0 --> 02:39:09,0
the poor, and

105
02:39:09,0 --> 02:39:09,0
all things

106
02:39:09,0 --> 02:39:09,0
pertaining to the

107
02:39:09,0 --> 02:39:09,0
bishopric

108
02:39:09,0 --> 02:39:09,0
both in the land

109
02:39:09,0 --> 02:39:09,0
of Zion and in

110
02:39:09,0 --> 02:38:47,
the land of Kirtland;

111
02:38:47,0 --> 02:38:47,0
13 For I have

112
02:38:47,0 --> 02:38:47,0
consecrated

113
02:38:47,0 --> 02:38:47,0
the land of

114
02:38:47,0 --> 02:38:47,0
Kirtland in mine

115
02:38:47,0 --> 02:38:47,0
own due time

116
02:38:47,0 --> 02:38:47,0
for the benefit

117
02:38:47,0 --> 02:38:47,0
of the saints

118
02:38:47,0 --> 02:38:47,0
of the Most

119
02:38:47,0 --> 02:38:47,0
High, and for a

120
02:38:47,0 --> 02:38:25,
stake to Zion.

121
02:38:25,0 --> 02:38:25,0
14 For Zion

122
02:38:25,0 --> 02:38:25,0
must increase

123
02:38:25,0 --> 02:38:25,0
in beauty,

124
02:38:25,0 --> 02:38:25,0
and in

125
02:38:25,0 --> 02:38:25,0
holiness; her borders

126
02:38:25,0 --> 02:38:25,0
must be

127
02:38:25,0 --> 02:38:25,0
enlarged; her

128
02:38:25,0 --> 02:38:25,0
stakes must be

129
02:38:25,0 --> 02:38:25,0
strengthened;

130
02:38:25,0 --> 02:38:25,0
yea, verily I

131
02:38:25,0 --> 02:38:25,0
say unto

132
02:38:25,0 --> 02:38:25,0
you, Zion must

133
02:38:25,0 --> 02:38:25,0
arise and put

134
02:38:25,0 --> 02:34:05,
on her beautiful garments.

135
02:34:05,0 --> 02:34:05,0
15

136
02:34:05,0 --> 02:34:05,0
Therefore, I give

137
02:34:05,0 --> 02:34:05,0
unto you this

138
02:34:05,0 --> 02:34:05,0
commandment,

139
02:34:05,0 --> 02:34:05,0
that ye bind

140
02:34:05,0 --> 02:34:05,0
yourselves

141
02:34:05,0 --> 02:34:05,0
by this

142
02:34:05,0 --> 02:34:05,0
covenant, and it

143
02:34:05,0 --> 02:34:05,0
shall be

144
02:34:05,0 --> 02:34:05,0
done according

145
02:34:05,0 --> 02:34:05,0
to the laws

146
02:34:05,0 --> 02:39:10,
of the Lord.

147
02:39:10,0 --> 02:39:10,0
16 Behold,

148
02:39:10,0 --> 02:39:10,0
here is

149
02:39:10,0 --> 02:39:10,0
wisdom also

150
02:39:10,0 --> 02:39:10,0
in me for

151
02:39:10,0 --> 02:40:14,
your good.

152
02:40:14,0 --> 02:40:14,0
17 And

153
02:40:14,0 --> 02:40:14,0
you are to

154
02:40:14,0 --> 02:40:14,0
be equal,

155
02:40:14,0 --> 02:40:14,0
or in

156
02:40:14,0 --> 02:40:14,0
other

157
02:40:14,0 --> 02:40:14,0
words, you are

158
02:40:14,0 --> 02:40:14,0
to have

159
02:40:14,0 --> 02:40:14,0
equal

160
02:40:14,0 --> 02:40:14,0
claims on

161
02:40:14,0 --> 02:40:14,0
the

162
02:40:14,0 --> 02:40:14,0
properties, for

163
02:40:14,0 --> 02:40:14,0
the

164
02:40:14,0 --> 02:40:14,0
benefit of

165
02:40:14,0 --> 02:40:14,0
managing the

166
02:40:14,0 --> 02:40:14,0
concerns

167
02:40:14,0 --> 02:40:14,0
of your

168
02:40:14,0 --> 02:40:14,0


169
02:40:14,0 --> 02:40:14,0
stewardships,

170
02:40:14,0 --> 02:40:14,0
every man

171
02:40:14,0 --> 02:40:14,0
according to

172
02:40:14,0 --> 02:40:14,0
his

173
02:40:14,0 --> 02:40:14,0
wants and his

174
02:40:14,0 --> 02:40:14,0
needs,

175
02:40:14,0 --> 02:52:20,
inasmuch as his wants are just—

176
02:52:20,0 --> 02:52:20,0
18 And

177
02:52:20,0 --> 02:52:20,0
all this

178
02:52:20,0 --> 02:52:20,0
for the

179
02:52:20,0 --> 02:52:20,0
benefit

180
02:52:20,0 --> 02:52:20,0
of the

181
02:52:20,0 --> 02:52:20,0
church of

182
02:52:20,0 --> 02:52:20,0
the

183
02:52:20,0 --> 02:52:20,0
living God,

184
02:52:20,0 --> 02:52:20,0
that

185
02:52:20,0 --> 02:52:20,0
every man

186
02:52:20,0 --> 02:52:20,0
may

187
02:52:20,0 --> 02:52:20,0
improve upon

188
02:52:20,0 --> 02:52:20,0
his

189
02:52:20,0 --> 02:52:20,0
talent,

190
02:52:20,0 --> 02:52:20,0
that every

191
02:52:20,0 --> 02:52:20,0
man may

192
02:52:20,0 --> 02:52:20,0
gain

193
02:52:20,0 --> 02:52:20,0
other

194
02:52:20,0 --> 02:52:20,0
talents, yea,

195
02:52:20,0 --> 02:52:20,0
even an

196
02:52:20,0 --> 02:52:20,0
hundred

197
02:52:20,0 --> 02:52:20,0
fold,

198
02:52:20,0 --> 02:52:20,0
to be

199
02:52:20,0 --> 02:52:20,0
cast into

200
02:52:20,0 --> 02:52:20,0
the

201
02:52:20,0 --> 02:52:20,0
Lord’s

202
02:52:20,0 --> 02:52:20,0
storehouse, to

203
02:52:20,0 --> 02:52:20,0
become

204
02:52:20,0 --> 02:52:20,0
the

205
02:52:20,0 --> 03:14:23,
common property of the whole church—

206
03:14:23,0 --> 03:14:23,0
19

207
03:14:23,0 --> 03:14:23,0
Every man

208
03:14:23,0 --> 03:14:23,0
seeking

209
03:14:23,0 --> 03:14:23,0
the

210
03:14:23,0 --> 03:14:23,0
interest

211
03:14:23,0 --> 03:14:23,0
of his

03:14:23,0 --> 03:14:23,0


213
03:14:23,0 --> 03:14:23,0
neighbor, and

214
03:14:23,0 --> 03:14:23,0
doing

215
03:14:23,0 --> 03:14:23,0
all

216
03:14:23,0 --> 03:14:23,0
things with

217
03:14:23,0 --> 03:14:23,0
an eye

218
03:14:23,0 --> 03:14:23,0
single

219
03:14:23,0 --> 03:34:00,
to the glory of God.

220
03:34:00,0 --> 03:34:00,0
20

221
03:34:00,0 --> 03:34:00,0
