00:00:11,295 --> 00:00:17,581
Section 71 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:17,581 --> 00:00:23,867
 Prophet and Sidney Rigdon, at Hiram, Ohio, December

3
00:00:23,867 --> 00:00:30,153
 1, 1831. The Prophet had continued to translate

4
00:00:30,153 --> 00:00:36,439
 the Bible with Sidney Rigdon as his scribe until

5
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:42,725
 this revelation was received, at which time it was

6
00:00:42,725 --> 00:00:49,011
 temporarily laid aside so as to enable them to

7
00:00:49,011 --> 00:00:55,297
 fulfill the instruction given herein. The brethren were

8
00:00:55,297 --> 00:01:01,583
 to go forth to preach in order to allay the

9
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:07,869
 unfriendly feelings that had developed against the

10
00:01:07,869 --> 00:01:14,155
 Church as a result of the publication of letters

11
00:01:14,155 --> 00:01:20,441
 written by Ezra Booth, who had apostatized. 
1–4,

12
00:01:20,441 --> 00:01:26,727
 Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon are sent forth to

13
00:01:26,727 --> 00:01:33,013
 proclaim the gospel; 
5–11, Enemies of the Saints will

14
00:01:33,013 --> 00:01:39,299
 be confounded.

15
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:43,057
1 Behold, thus saith the Lord unto you my servants

16
00:01:43,057 --> 00:01:46,932
 Joseph Smith, Jun., and Sidney Rigdon, that the

17
00:01:46,932 --> 00:01:50,807
 time has verily come that it is necessary and

18
00:01:50,807 --> 00:01:54,682
 expedient in me that you should open your mouths in

19
00:01:54,682 --> 00:01:58,557
 proclaiming my gospel, the things of the kingdom,

20
00:01:58,557 --> 00:02:02,432
 expounding the mysteries thereof out of the

21
00:02:02,432 --> 00:02:06,307
 scriptures, according to that portion of Spirit and power

22
00:02:06,307 --> 00:02:10,182
 which shall be given unto you, even as I will

23
00:02:10,43 --> 00:02:13,93
2 Verily I say unto you, proclaim unto the world

24
00:02:13,93 --> 00:02:17,43
 in the regions round about, and in the church also,

25
00:02:17,43 --> 00:02:20,93
 for the space of a season, even until it shall be

26
00:02:20,93 --> 00:02:24,43
 made known unto you

27
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:28,445
3 Verily this is a mission for a season, which I

28
00:02:28,445 --> 00:02:31,945
 give unto you

29
00:02:31,468 --> 00:02:36,218
4 Wherefore, labor ye in my vineyard. Call upon

30
00:02:36,218 --> 00:02:40,968
 the inhabitants of the earth, and bear record, and

31
00:02:40,968 --> 00:02:45,718
 prepare the way for the commandments and

32
00:02:45,718 --> 00:02:50,468
 revelations which are to come

33
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:55,737
5 Now, behold this is wisdom; whoso readeth, let

34
00:02:55,737 --> 00:03:00,737
 him understand and receive also

35
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:04,247
6 For unto him that receiveth it shall be given

36
00:03:04,247 --> 00:03:07,747
 more abundantly, even power

37
00:03:07,27 --> 00:03:11,52
7 Wherefore, confound your enemies; call upon them

38
00:03:11,52 --> 00:03:15,77
 to meet you both in public and in private; and

39
00:03:15,77 --> 00:03:20,02
 inasmuch as ye are faithful their shame shall be

40
00:03:20,02 --> 00:03:24,27
 made manifest

41
00:03:24,054 --> 00:03:28,054
8 Wherefore, let them bring forth their strong

42
00:03:28,054 --> 00:03:32,054
 reasons against the Lord

43
00:03:32,863 --> 00:03:37,363
9 Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you—there is no

44
00:03:37,363 --> 00:03:41,863
 weapon that is formed against you shall prosper

45
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:45,671
10 And if any man lift his voice against you he

46
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:50,171
 shall be confounded in mine own due time

47
00:03:50,213 --> 00:03:55,213
11 Wherefore, keep my commandments; they are true

48
00:03:55,213 --> 00:04:00,213
 and faithful. Even so. Amen.
