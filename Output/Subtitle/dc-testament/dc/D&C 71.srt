00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 71 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Prophet and Sidney Rigdon, at Hiram, Ohio,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
December 1, 1831. The Prophet had continued to

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
translate the Bible with Sidney Rigdon as his

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
scribe until this revelation was received, at which

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
time it was temporarily laid aside so as to

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
enable them to fulfill the instruction given

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
herein. The brethren were to go forth to preach in

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
order to allay the unfriendly feelings that had

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
developed against the Church as a result of

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the publication of letters written by Ezra Booth,

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
who had apostatized. 
1–4, Joseph Smith and

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Sidney Rigdon are sent forth to proclaim the

14
00:00:00,0 --> 01:38:22,
gospel; 
5–11, Enemies of the Saints will be confounded. 

15
01:38:22,0 --> 01:38:22,0
1 Behold, thus saith the Lord unto you my

16
01:38:22,0 --> 01:38:22,0
servants Joseph Smith, Jun., and Sidney

17
01:38:22,0 --> 01:38:22,0
Rigdon, that the time has verily come that it

18
01:38:22,0 --> 01:38:22,0
is necessary and expedient in me that you

19
01:38:22,0 --> 01:38:22,0
should open your mouths in proclaiming my

20
01:38:22,0 --> 01:38:22,0
gospel, the things of the kingdom, expounding

21
01:38:22,0 --> 01:38:22,0
the mysteries thereof out of the

22
01:38:22,0 --> 01:38:22,0
scriptures, according to that portion of Spirit and

23
01:38:22,0 --> 02:07:24,
power which shall be given unto you, even as I will.

24
02:07:24,0 --> 02:07:24,0
2 Verily I say unto you, proclaim unto the

25
02:07:24,0 --> 02:07:24,0
world in the regions round about, and in

26
02:07:24,0 --> 02:07:24,0
the church also, for the space of a

27
02:07:24,0 --> 02:09:28,
season, even until it shall be made known unto you.

28
02:09:28,0 --> 02:09:28,0
3 Verily this is a mission for

29
02:09:28,0 --> 02:24:30,
a season, which I give unto you.

30
02:24:30,0 --> 02:24:30,0
4 Wherefore, labor ye in my

31
02:24:30,0 --> 02:24:30,0
vineyard. Call upon the

32
02:24:30,0 --> 02:24:30,0
inhabitants of the earth, and

33
02:24:30,0 --> 02:24:30,0
bear record, and prepare the

34
02:24:30,0 --> 02:24:30,0
way for the commandments and

35
02:24:30,0 --> 02:31:05,
revelations which are to come.

36
02:31:05,0 --> 02:31:05,0
5 Now, behold this is

37
02:31:05,0 --> 02:31:05,0
wisdom; whoso readeth, let him

38
02:31:05,0 --> 02:50:42,
understand and receive also;

39
02:50:42,0 --> 02:50:42,0
6 For unto him that

40
02:50:42,0 --> 02:50:42,0
receiveth it shall be given

41
02:50:42,0 --> 02:58:47,
more abundantly, even power.

42
02:58:47,0 --> 02:58:47,0
7 Wherefore, confound

43
02:58:47,0 --> 02:58:47,0
your enemies; call upon

44
02:58:47,0 --> 02:58:47,0
them to meet you both

45
02:58:47,0 --> 02:58:47,0
in public and in

46
02:58:47,0 --> 02:58:47,0
private; and inasmuch as ye

47
02:58:47,0 --> 02:58:47,0
are faithful their shame

48
02:58:47,0 --> 02:54:27,
shall be made manifest.

49
02:54:27,0 --> 02:54:27,0
8 Wherefore, let

50
02:54:27,0 --> 02:54:27,0
them bring forth

51
02:54:27,0 --> 02:54:27,0
their strong reasons

52
02:54:27,0 --> 02:59:32,
against the Lord.

53
02:59:32,0 --> 02:59:32,0
9 Verily, thus

54
02:59:32,0 --> 02:59:32,0
saith the Lord

55
02:59:32,0 --> 02:59:32,0
unto you—there is

56
02:59:32,0 --> 02:59:32,0
no weapon that

57
02:59:32,0 --> 02:59:32,0
is formed against

58
02:59:32,0 --> 03:06:35,
you shall prosper;

59
03:06:35,0 --> 03:06:35,0
10 And if any

60
03:06:35,0 --> 03:06:35,0
man lift his

61
03:06:35,0 --> 03:06:35,0
voice against

62
03:06:35,0 --> 03:06:35,0
you he shall be

63
03:06:35,0 --> 03:06:35,0
confounded in

64
03:06:35,0 --> 03:21:37,
mine own due time.

65
03:21:37,0 --> 03:21:37,0
11 Wherefore,

66
03:21:37,0 --> 03:21:37,0
keep my

67
03:21:37,0 --> 03:21:37,0
commandments;

68
03:21:37,0 --> 03:21:37,0
they are true

69
03:21:37,0 --> 03:21:37,0
and faithful.

70
03:21:37,0 --> 03:22:41,
Even so. Amen.
