Section 127 An epistle from Joseph Smith

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Prophet to the Latter-day Saints at

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Nauvoo, Illinois, containing directions on

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
baptism for the dead, dated at Nauvoo, September

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
1, 1842. 
1–4, Joseph Smith glories in

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
persecution and tribulation; 
5–12, Records

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:52:59,
must be kept relative to baptisms for the dead. 

8
00:52:59,0 --> 00:52:59,0
1 Forasmuch as the Lord has revealed unto

9
00:52:59,0 --> 00:52:59,0
me that my enemies, both in Missouri and

10
00:52:59,0 --> 00:52:59,0
this State, were again in the pursuit of

11
00:52:59,0 --> 00:52:59,0
me; and inasmuch as they pursue me without a

12
00:52:59,0 --> 00:52:59,0
cause, and have not the least shadow or

13
00:52:59,0 --> 00:52:59,0
coloring of justice or right on their side

14
00:52:59,0 --> 00:52:59,0
in the getting up of their prosecutions

15
00:52:59,0 --> 00:52:59,0
against me; and inasmuch as their

16
00:52:59,0 --> 00:52:59,0
pretensions are all founded in falsehood of the

17
00:52:59,0 --> 00:52:59,0
blackest dye, I have thought it expedient and

18
00:52:59,0 --> 00:52:59,0
wisdom in me to leave the place for a

19
00:52:59,0 --> 00:52:59,0
short season, for my own safety and the safety

20
00:52:59,0 --> 00:52:59,0
of this people. I would say to all those

21
00:52:59,0 --> 00:52:59,0
with whom I have business, that I have

22
00:52:59,0 --> 00:52:59,0
left my affairs with agents and clerks who

23
00:52:59,0 --> 00:52:59,0
will transact all business in a prompt and

24
00:52:59,0 --> 00:52:59,0
proper manner, and will see that all my

25
00:52:59,0 --> 00:52:59,0
debts are canceled in due time, by turning

26
00:52:59,0 --> 00:52:59,0
out property, or otherwise, as the case may

27
00:52:59,0 --> 00:52:59,0
require, or as the circumstances may admit

28
00:52:59,0 --> 00:52:59,0
of. When I learn that the storm is fully

29
00:52:59,0 --> 00:48:39,
blown over, then I will return to you again.

30
00:48:39,0 --> 00:48:39,0
2 And as for the perils which I am

31
00:48:39,0 --> 00:48:39,0
called to pass through, they seem but a

32
00:48:39,0 --> 00:48:39,0
small thing to me, as the envy and wrath

33
00:48:39,0 --> 00:48:39,0
of man have been my common lot all the

34
00:48:39,0 --> 00:48:39,0
days of my life; and for what cause it

35
00:48:39,0 --> 00:48:39,0
seems mysterious, unless I was ordained

36
00:48:39,0 --> 00:48:39,0
from before the foundation of the world

37
00:48:39,0 --> 00:48:39,0
for some good end, or bad, as you may

38
00:48:39,0 --> 00:48:39,0
choose to call it. Judge ye for

39
00:48:39,0 --> 00:48:39,0
yourselves. God knoweth all these things,

40
00:48:39,0 --> 00:48:39,0
whether it be good or bad. But

41
00:48:39,0 --> 00:48:39,0
nevertheless, deep water is what I am wont to swim

42
00:48:39,0 --> 00:48:39,0
in. It all has become a second nature

43
00:48:39,0 --> 00:48:39,0
to me; and I feel, like Paul, to glory

44
00:48:39,0 --> 00:48:39,0
in tribulation; for to this day has the

45
00:48:39,0 --> 00:48:39,0
God of my fathers delivered me out of

46
00:48:39,0 --> 00:48:39,0
them all, and will deliver me from

47
00:48:39,0 --> 00:48:39,0
henceforth; for behold, and lo, I shall

48
00:48:39,0 --> 00:53:44,
triumph over all my enemies, for the Lord God hath spoken it.

49
00:53:44,0 --> 00:53:44,0
3 Let all the saints rejoice,

50
00:53:44,0 --> 00:53:44,0
therefore, and be exceedingly glad; for

51
00:53:44,0 --> 00:53:44,0
Israel’s God is their God, and he will

52
00:53:44,0 --> 00:53:44,0
mete out a just recompense of reward

53
00:53:44,0 --> 02:44:34,
upon the heads of all their oppressors.

54
02:44:34,0 --> 02:44:34,0
4 And again, verily thus saith the

55
02:44:34,0 --> 02:44:34,0
Lord: Let the work of my temple,

56
02:44:34,0 --> 02:44:34,0
and all the works which I have

57
02:44:34,0 --> 02:44:34,0
appointed unto you, be continued on

58
02:44:34,0 --> 02:44:34,0
and not cease; and let your

59
02:44:34,0 --> 02:44:34,0
diligence, and your perseverance, and

60
02:44:34,0 --> 02:44:34,0
patience, and your works be

61
02:44:34,0 --> 02:44:34,0
redoubled, and you shall in nowise lose

62
02:44:34,0 --> 02:44:34,0
your reward, saith the Lord of Hosts.

63
02:44:34,0 --> 02:44:34,0
And if they persecute you, so

64
02:44:34,0 --> 02:44:34,0
persecuted they the prophets and

65
02:44:34,0 --> 02:44:34,0
righteous men that were before you.

66
02:44:34,0 --> 02:55:34,
For all this there is a reward in heaven.

67
02:55:34,0 --> 02:55:34,0
5 And again, I give unto

68
02:55:34,0 --> 02:55:34,0
you a word in relation to

69
02:55:34,0 --> 04:21:29,
the baptism for your dead.

70
04:21:29,0 --> 04:21:29,0
6 Verily, thus saith the

71
04:21:29,0 --> 04:21:29,0
Lord unto you concerning

72
04:21:29,0 --> 04:21:29,0
your dead: When any of

73
04:21:29,0 --> 04:21:29,0
you are baptized for your

74
04:21:29,0 --> 04:21:29,0
dead, let there be a

75
04:21:29,0 --> 04:21:29,0
recorder, and let him be

76
04:21:29,0 --> 04:21:29,0
eye-witness of your baptisms;

77
04:21:29,0 --> 04:21:29,0
let him hear with his

78
04:21:29,0 --> 04:21:29,0
ears, that he may testify of

79
04:21:29,0 --> 04:49:33,
a truth, saith the Lord;

80
04:49:33,0 --> 04:49:33,0
7 That in all your

81
04:49:33,0 --> 04:49:33,0
recordings it may be recorded

82
04:49:33,0 --> 04:49:33,0
in heaven; whatsoever

83
04:49:33,0 --> 04:49:33,0
you bind on earth, may be

84
04:49:33,0 --> 04:49:33,0
bound in heaven;

85
04:49:33,0 --> 04:49:33,0
whatsoever you loose on earth,

86
04:49:33,0 --> 04:45:13,
may be loosed in heaven;

87
04:45:13,0 --> 04:45:13,0
8 For I am about to

88
04:45:13,0 --> 04:45:13,0
restore many things to

89
04:45:13,0 --> 04:45:13,0
the earth,

90
04:45:13,0 --> 04:45:13,0
pertaining to the priesthood,

91
04:45:13,0 --> 04:49:50,
saith the Lord of Hosts.

92
04:49:50,0 --> 04:49:50,0
9 And again, let all

93
04:49:50,0 --> 04:49:50,0
the records be had

94
04:49:50,0 --> 04:49:50,0
in order, that they

95
04:49:50,0 --> 04:49:50,0
may be put in the

96
04:49:50,0 --> 04:49:50,0
archives of my holy

97
04:49:50,0 --> 04:49:50,0
temple, to be held in

98
04:49:50,0 --> 04:49:50,0
remembrance from

99
04:49:50,0 --> 04:49:50,0
generation to

100
04:49:50,0 --> 05:08:49,
generation, saith the Lord of Hosts.

101
05:08:49,0 --> 05:08:49,0
10 I will say to

102
05:08:49,0 --> 05:08:49,0
all the saints, that

103
05:08:49,0 --> 05:08:49,0
I desired, with

104
05:08:49,0 --> 05:08:49,0
exceedingly great

105
05:08:49,0 --> 05:08:49,0
desire, to have

106
05:08:49,0 --> 05:08:49,0
addressed them from the

107
05:08:49,0 --> 05:08:49,0
stand on the subject

108
05:08:49,0 --> 05:08:49,0
of baptism for the

109
05:08:49,0 --> 05:08:49,0
dead, on the

110
05:08:49,0 --> 05:08:49,0
following Sabbath. But

111
05:08:49,0 --> 05:08:49,0
inasmuch as it is out

112
05:08:49,0 --> 05:08:49,0
of my power to do

113
05:08:49,0 --> 05:08:49,0
so, I will write

114
05:08:49,0 --> 05:08:49,0
the word of the Lord

115
05:08:49,0 --> 05:08:49,0
from time to time,

116
05:08:49,0 --> 05:08:49,0
on that subject,

117
05:08:49,0 --> 05:08:49,0
and send it to you by

118
05:08:49,0 --> 05:43:46,
mail, as well as many other things.

119
05:43:46,0 --> 05:43:46,0
11 I now close my

120
05:43:46,0 --> 05:43:46,0
letter for the

121
05:43:46,0 --> 05:43:46,0
present, for the want

122
05:43:46,0 --> 05:43:46,0
of more time; for

123
05:43:46,0 --> 05:43:46,0
the enemy is on

124
05:43:46,0 --> 05:43:46,0
the alert, and as

125
05:43:46,0 --> 05:43:46,0
the Savior said,

126
05:43:46,0 --> 05:43:46,0
the prince of this

127
05:43:46,0 --> 05:43:46,0
world cometh, but

128
05:43:46,0 --> 05:57:50,
he hath nothing in me.

129
05:57:50,0 --> 05:57:50,0
12 Behold, my

130
05:57:50,0 --> 05:57:50,0
prayer to God is

131
05:57:50,0 --> 05:57:50,0
that you all may be

132
05:57:50,0 --> 05:57:50,0
saved. And I

133
05:57:50,0 --> 05:57:50,0
subscribe myself your

134
05:57:50,0 --> 05:57:50,0
servant in the

135
05:57:50,0 --> 05:57:50,0
Lord, prophet and

136
05:57:50,0 --> 05:57:50,0
seer of The

137
05:57:50,0 --> 05:57:50,0
Church of Jesus Christ

138
05:57:50,0 --> 05:57:50,0
of Latter-day

139
05:57:50,0 --> 06:12:52,
Saints.Joseph Smith.
