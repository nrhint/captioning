00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:17,421
Section 127 An epistle from Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:17,421 --> 00:00:23,564
 Prophet to the Latter-day Saints at Nauvoo, Illinois,

3
00:00:23,564 --> 00:00:29,707
 containing directions on baptism for the dead,

4
00:00:29,707 --> 00:00:35,85
 dated at Nauvoo, September 1, 1842. 
1–4, Joseph Smith

5
00:00:35,85 --> 00:00:41,993
 glories in persecution and tribulation; 
5–12,

6
00:00:41,993 --> 00:00:48,136
 Records must be kept relative to baptisms for the

7
00:00:48,136 --> 00:00:54,279
 dead.

8
00:00:54,521 --> 00:01:00,363
1 Forasmuch as the Lord has revealed unto me that

9
00:01:00,363 --> 00:01:06,205
 my enemies, both in Missouri and this State, were

10
00:01:06,205 --> 00:01:12,047
 again in the pursuit of me; and inasmuch as they

11
00:01:12,047 --> 00:01:17,889
 pursue me without a cause, and have not the least

12
00:01:17,889 --> 00:01:23,731
 shadow or coloring of justice or right on their

13
00:01:23,731 --> 00:01:29,573
 side in the getting up of their prosecutions against

14
00:01:29,573 --> 00:01:35,415
 me; and inasmuch as their pretensions are all

15
00:01:35,415 --> 00:01:41,257
 founded in falsehood of the blackest dye, I have

16
00:01:41,257 --> 00:01:47,099
 thought it expedient and wisdom in me to leave the

17
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:52,941
 place for a short season, for my own safety and the

18
00:01:52,941 --> 00:01:58,783
 safety of this people. I would say to all those with

19
00:01:58,783 --> 00:02:04,625
 whom I have business, that I have left my affairs

20
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:10,467
 with agents and clerks who will transact all

21
00:02:10,467 --> 00:02:16,309
 business in a prompt and proper manner, and will see

22
00:02:16,309 --> 00:02:22,151
 that all my debts are canceled in due time, by

23
00:02:22,151 --> 00:02:27,993
 turning out property, or otherwise, as the case may

24
00:02:27,993 --> 00:02:33,835
 require, or as the circumstances may admit of. When

25
00:02:33,835 --> 00:02:39,677
 I learn that the storm is fully blown over, then I

26
00:02:39,677 --> 00:02:45,519
 will return to you again

27
00:02:45,682 --> 00:02:51,744
2 And as for the perils which I am called to pass

28
00:02:51,744 --> 00:02:57,806
 through, they seem but a small thing to me, as the

29
00:02:57,806 --> 00:03:03,868
 envy and wrath of man have been my common lot all

30
00:03:03,868 --> 00:03:09,93
 the days of my life; and for what cause it seems

31
00:03:09,93 --> 00:03:15,992
 mysterious, unless I was ordained from before the

32
00:03:15,992 --> 00:03:22,054
 foundation of the world for some good end, or bad,

33
00:03:22,054 --> 00:03:28,116
 as you may choose to call it. Judge ye for

34
00:03:28,116 --> 00:03:34,178
 yourselves. God knoweth all these things, whether it be

35
00:03:34,178 --> 00:03:40,24
 good or bad. But nevertheless, deep water is what

36
00:03:40,24 --> 00:03:46,302
 I am wont to swim in. It all has become a second

37
00:03:46,302 --> 00:03:52,364
 nature to me; and I feel, like Paul, to glory in

38
00:03:52,364 --> 00:03:58,426
 tribulation; for to this day has the God of my

39
00:03:58,426 --> 00:04:04,488
 fathers delivered me out of them all, and will deliver

40
00:04:04,488 --> 00:04:10,55
 me from henceforth; for behold, and lo, I shall

41
00:04:10,55 --> 00:04:16,612
 triumph over all my enemies, for the Lord God hath

42
00:04:16,612 --> 00:04:22,674
 spoken it

43
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:29,629
3 Let all the saints rejoice, therefore, and be

44
00:04:29,629 --> 00:04:36,629
 exceedingly glad; for Israel’s God is their God, and

45
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:43,629
 he will mete out a just recompense of reward upon

46
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:50,629
 the heads of all their oppressors

47
00:04:50,607 --> 00:04:55,051
4 And again, verily thus saith the Lord: Let the

48
00:04:55,051 --> 00:04:59,495
 work of my temple, and all the works which I have

49
00:04:59,495 --> 00:05:03,939
 appointed unto you, be continued on and not cease;

50
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:08,383
 and let your diligence, and your perseverance, and

51
00:05:08,383 --> 00:05:12,827
 patience, and your works be redoubled, and you

52
00:05:12,827 --> 00:05:17,271
 shall in nowise lose your reward, saith the Lord of

53
00:05:17,271 --> 00:05:21,715
 Hosts. And if they persecute you, so persecuted

54
00:05:21,715 --> 00:05:26,159
 they the prophets and righteous men that were before

55
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:30,603
 you. For all this there is a reward in heaven

56
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:34,064
5 And again, I give unto you a word in relation to

57
00:05:34,064 --> 00:05:37,564
 the baptism for your dead

58
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:41,238
6 Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you concerning

59
00:05:41,238 --> 00:05:44,905
 your dead: When any of you are baptized for your

60
00:05:44,905 --> 00:05:48,572
 dead, let there be a recorder, and let him be

61
00:05:48,572 --> 00:05:52,239
 eye-witness of your baptisms; let him hear with his

62
00:05:52,239 --> 00:05:55,906
 ears, that he may testify of a truth, saith the Lord

63
00:05:55,906 --> 00:05:59,573


64
00:05:59,075 --> 00:06:04,075
7 That in all your recordings it may be recorded

65
00:06:04,075 --> 00:06:09,075
 in heaven; whatsoever you bind on earth, may be

66
00:06:09,075 --> 00:06:14,075
 bound in heaven; whatsoever you loose on earth, may

67
00:06:14,075 --> 00:06:19,075
 be loosed in heaven

68
00:06:19,362 --> 00:06:22,695
8 For I am about to restore many things to the

69
00:06:22,695 --> 00:06:26,028
 earth, pertaining to the priesthood, saith the Lord

70
00:06:26,028 --> 00:06:29,361
 of Hosts

71
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:34,689
9 And again, let all the records be had in order,

72
00:06:34,689 --> 00:06:39,939
 that they may be put in the archives of my holy

73
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:45,189
 temple, to be held in remembrance from generation to

74
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:50,439
 generation, saith the Lord of Hosts

75
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:54,694
10 I will say to all the saints, that I desired,

76
00:06:54,694 --> 00:06:58,444
 with exceedingly great desire, to have addressed

77
00:06:58,444 --> 00:07:02,194
 them from the stand on the subject of baptism for

78
00:07:02,194 --> 00:07:05,944
 the dead, on the following Sabbath. But inasmuch as

79
00:07:05,944 --> 00:07:09,694
 it is out of my power to do so, I will write the

80
00:07:09,694 --> 00:07:13,444
 word of the Lord from time to time, on that

81
00:07:13,444 --> 00:07:17,194
 subject, and send it to you by mail, as well as many

82
00:07:17,194 --> 00:07:20,944
 other things

83
00:07:20,957 --> 00:07:27,707
11 I now close my letter for the present, for the

84
00:07:27,707 --> 00:07:34,457
 want of more time; for the enemy is on the alert,

85
00:07:34,457 --> 00:07:41,207
 and as the Savior said, the prince of this world

86
00:07:41,207 --> 00:07:47,957
 cometh, but he hath nothing in me

87
00:07:47,25 --> 00:07:53,75
12 Behold, my prayer to God is that you all may be

88
00:07:53,75 --> 00:08:00,25
 saved. And I subscribe myself your servant in the

89
00:08:00,25 --> 00:08:06,75
 Lord, prophet and seer of The Church of Jesus

90
00:08:06,75 --> 00:08:13,25
 Christ of Latter-day Saints.Joseph Smith.
