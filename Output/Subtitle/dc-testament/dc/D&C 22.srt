Section 22 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:17,135 --> 00:00:22,992
 the Prophet, at Manchester, New York, April 16,

3
00:00:22,992 --> 00:00:28,849
 1830. This revelation was given to the Church in

4
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:34,706
 consequence of some who had previously been baptized

5
00:00:34,706 --> 00:00:40,563
 desiring to unite with the Church without

6
00:00:40,563 --> 00:00:46,42
 rebaptism. 
1, Baptism is a new and everlasting covenant;

7
00:00:46,42 --> 00:00:52,277
2â€“4, Authoritative baptism is required.

8
00:00:52,953 --> 00:00:57,703
1 Behold, I say unto you that all old covenants

9
00:00:57,703 --> 00:01:02,453
 have I caused to be done away in this thing; and

10
00:01:02,453 --> 00:01:07,203
 this is a new and an everlasting covenant, even that

11
00:01:07,203 --> 00:01:11,953
 which was from the beginning

12
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:18,189
2 Wherefore, although a man should be baptized an

13
00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:24,439
 hundred times it availeth him nothing, for you

14
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:30,689
 cannot enter in at the strait gate by the law of

15
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:36,939
 Moses, neither by your dead works

16
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:42,964
3 For it is because of your dead works that I have

17
00:01:42,964 --> 00:01:48,964
 caused this last covenant and this church to be

18
00:01:48,964 --> 00:01:54,964
 built up unto me, even as in days of old

19
00:01:54,948 --> 00:02:04,948
4 Wherefore, enter ye in at the gate, as I have

20
00:02:04,948 --> 00:02:14,948
 commanded, and seek not to counsel your God. Amen.
