00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:07,429
Section 22 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:07,429 --> 00:00:14,858
the Prophet, at Manchester, New York, April 16,

3
00:00:14,858 --> 00:00:22,287
1830. This revelation was given to the Church

4
00:00:22,287 --> 00:00:29,716
in consequence of some who had previously been

5
00:00:29,716 --> 00:00:37,145
baptized desiring to unite with the Church without

6
00:00:37,145 --> 00:00:44,574
rebaptism. 
1, Baptism is a new and everlasting

7
00:00:44,574 --> 00:00:52,252
covenant; 
2â€“4, Authoritative baptism is required. 

8
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:56,752
1 Behold, I say unto you that all old

9
00:00:56,752 --> 00:01:01,252
covenants have I caused to be done away in this

10
00:01:01,252 --> 00:01:05,752
thing; and this is a new and an everlasting

11
00:01:05,752 --> 00:01:10,604
covenant, even that which was from the beginning.

12
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:15,804
2 Wherefore, although a man should

13
00:01:15,804 --> 00:01:21,004
be baptized an hundred times it

14
00:01:21,004 --> 00:01:26,204
availeth him nothing, for you cannot

15
00:01:26,204 --> 00:01:31,404
enter in at the strait gate by the law

16
00:01:31,404 --> 00:01:36,463
of Moses, neither by your dead works.

17
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:37,463
3 For it is because of your dead

18
00:01:37,463 --> 00:01:38,463
works that I have caused this last

19
00:01:38,463 --> 00:01:39,463
covenant and this church to be built

20
00:01:39,463 --> 00:01:40,867
up unto me, even as in days of old.

21
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:45,534
4 Wherefore, enter ye in at the

22
00:01:45,534 --> 00:01:50,201
gate, as I have commanded, and

23
00:01:50,201 --> 00:01:54,247
seek not to counsel your God. Amen.
