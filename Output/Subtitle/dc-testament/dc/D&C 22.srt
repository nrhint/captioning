Section 22 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Prophet, at Manchester, New York, April 16,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
1830. This revelation was given to the Church

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
in consequence of some who had previously been

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
baptized desiring to unite with the Church without

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
rebaptism. 
1, Baptism is a new and everlasting

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:26:06,
covenant; 
2â€“4, Authoritative baptism is required. 

8
00:26:06,0 --> 00:26:06,0
1 Behold, I say unto you that all old

9
00:26:06,0 --> 00:26:06,0
covenants have I caused to be done away in this

10
00:26:06,0 --> 00:26:06,0
thing; and this is a new and an everlasting

11
00:26:06,0 --> 00:33:50,
covenant, even that which was from the beginning.

12
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
2 Wherefore, although a man should

13
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
be baptized an hundred times it

14
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
availeth him nothing, for you cannot

15
00:33:50,0 --> 00:33:50,0
enter in at the strait gate by the law

16
00:33:50,0 --> 00:35:02,
of Moses, neither by your dead works.

17
00:35:02,0 --> 00:35:02,0
3 For it is because of your dead

18
00:35:02,0 --> 00:35:02,0
works that I have caused this last

19
00:35:02,0 --> 00:35:02,0
covenant and this church to be built

20
00:35:02,0 --> 00:48:11,
up unto me, even as in days of old.

21
00:48:11,0 --> 00:48:11,0
4 Wherefore, enter ye in at the

22
00:48:11,0 --> 00:48:11,0
gate, as I have commanded, and

23
00:48:11,0 --> 00:57:07,
seek not to counsel your God. Amen.
