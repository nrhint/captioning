00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 117 Revelation given through Joseph

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Smith the Prophet, at Far West, Missouri, July 8,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
1838, concerning the immediate duties of William

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Marks, Newel K. Whitney, and Oliver Granger.

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
1–9, The Lord’s servants should not covet temporal

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
things, for “what is property unto the Lord?”;

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
10–16, They are to forsake littleness of soul,

8
00:00:00,0 --> 01:08:57,
and their sacrifices will be sacred unto the Lord. 

9
01:08:57,0 --> 01:08:57,0
1 Verily thus saith the Lord unto my

10
01:08:57,0 --> 01:08:57,0
servant William Marks, and also unto my

11
01:08:57,0 --> 01:08:57,0
servant Newel K. Whitney, let them settle

12
01:08:57,0 --> 01:08:57,0
up their business speedily and journey

13
01:08:57,0 --> 01:08:57,0
from the land of Kirtland, before I, the

14
01:08:57,0 --> 01:08:35,
Lord, send again the snows upon the earth.

15
01:08:35,0 --> 01:08:35,0
2 Let them awake, and arise,

16
01:08:35,0 --> 01:08:35,0
and come forth, and not

17
01:08:35,0 --> 01:04:15,
tarry, for I, the Lord, command it.

18
01:04:15,0 --> 01:04:15,0
3 Therefore, if they tarry it

19
01:04:15,0 --> 01:08:52,
shall not be well with them.

20
01:08:52,0 --> 01:08:52,0
4 Let them repent of all

21
01:08:52,0 --> 01:08:52,0
their sins, and of all their

22
01:08:52,0 --> 01:08:52,0
covetous desires, before me,

23
01:08:52,0 --> 01:08:52,0
saith the Lord; for what is

24
01:08:52,0 --> 01:08:30,
property unto me? saith the Lord.

25
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
5 Let the properties of

26
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
Kirtland be turned out

27
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
for debts, saith the

28
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
Lord. Let them go, saith the

29
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
Lord, and whatsoever

30
01:08:30,0 --> 01:08:30,0
remaineth, let it remain

31
01:08:30,0 --> 01:04:10,
in your hands, saith the Lord.

32
01:04:10,0 --> 01:04:10,0
6 For have I not the

33
01:04:10,0 --> 01:04:10,0
fowls of heaven, and

34
01:04:10,0 --> 01:04:10,0
also the fish of the

35
01:04:10,0 --> 01:04:10,0
sea, and the beasts of

36
01:04:10,0 --> 01:04:10,0
the mountains? Have I

37
01:04:10,0 --> 01:04:10,0
not made the earth? Do I

38
01:04:10,0 --> 01:04:10,0
not hold the

39
01:04:10,0 --> 01:04:10,0
destinies of all the armies of

40
01:04:10,0 --> 01:08:47,
the nations of the earth?

41
01:08:47,0 --> 01:08:47,0
7 Therefore, will I

42
01:08:47,0 --> 01:08:47,0
not make solitary

43
01:08:47,0 --> 01:08:47,0
places to bud and

44
01:08:47,0 --> 01:08:47,0
to blossom, and to

45
01:08:47,0 --> 01:08:47,0
bring forth in

46
01:08:47,0 --> 01:08:25,
abundance? saith the Lord.

47
01:08:25,0 --> 01:08:25,0
8 Is there not

48
01:08:25,0 --> 01:08:25,0
room enough on the

49
01:08:25,0 --> 01:08:25,0
mountains of

50
01:08:25,0 --> 01:08:25,0
Adam-ondi-Ahman, and on

51
01:08:25,0 --> 01:08:25,0
the plains of Olaha

52
01:08:25,0 --> 01:08:25,0
Shinehah, or the

53
01:08:25,0 --> 01:08:25,0
land where Adam

54
01:08:25,0 --> 01:08:25,0
dwelt, that you

55
01:08:25,0 --> 01:08:25,0
should covet that

56
01:08:25,0 --> 01:08:25,0
which is but the drop,

57
01:08:25,0 --> 01:08:25,0
and neglect the

58
01:08:25,0 --> 01:04:05,
more weighty matters?

59
01:04:05,0 --> 01:04:05,0
9 Therefore,

60
01:04:05,0 --> 01:04:05,0
come up hither unto

61
01:04:05,0 --> 01:04:05,0
the land of my

62
01:04:05,0 --> 01:09:10,
people, even Zion.

63
01:09:10,0 --> 01:09:10,0
10 Let my

64
01:09:10,0 --> 01:09:10,0
servant William

65
01:09:10,0 --> 01:09:10,0
Marks be faithful

66
01:09:10,0 --> 01:09:10,0
over a few

67
01:09:10,0 --> 01:09:10,0
things, and he shall

68
01:09:10,0 --> 01:09:10,0
be a ruler

69
01:09:10,0 --> 01:09:10,0
over many. Let him

70
01:09:10,0 --> 01:09:10,0
preside in the

71
01:09:10,0 --> 01:09:10,0
midst of my

72
01:09:10,0 --> 01:09:10,0
people in the

73
01:09:10,0 --> 01:09:10,0
city of Far West,

74
01:09:10,0 --> 01:09:10,0
and let him be

75
01:09:10,0 --> 01:09:10,0
blessed with

76
01:09:10,0 --> 01:10:14,
the blessings of my people.

77
01:10:14,0 --> 01:10:14,0
11 Let my

78
01:10:14,0 --> 01:10:14,0
servant Newel K.

79
01:10:14,0 --> 01:10:14,0
Whitney be

80
01:10:14,0 --> 01:10:14,0
ashamed of the

81
01:10:14,0 --> 01:10:14,0
Nicolaitane band

82
01:10:14,0 --> 01:10:14,0
and of all

83
01:10:14,0 --> 01:10:14,0
their secret

84
01:10:14,0 --> 01:10:14,0
abominations, and

85
01:10:14,0 --> 01:10:14,0
of all his

86
01:10:14,0 --> 01:10:14,0
littleness of

87
01:10:14,0 --> 01:10:14,0
soul before me,

88
01:10:14,0 --> 01:10:14,0
saith the Lord,

89
01:10:14,0 --> 01:10:14,0
and come up

90
01:10:14,0 --> 01:10:14,0
to the land of

91
01:10:14,0 --> 01:10:14,0


92
01:10:14,0 --> 01:10:14,0
Adam-ondi-Ahman, and be a

93
01:10:14,0 --> 01:10:14,0
bishop unto my

94
01:10:14,0 --> 01:10:14,0
people, saith

95
01:10:14,0 --> 01:10:14,0
the Lord, not

96
01:10:14,0 --> 01:10:14,0
in name but in

97
01:10:14,0 --> 01:41:14,
deed, saith the Lord.

98
01:41:14,0 --> 01:41:14,0
12 And again,

99
01:41:14,0 --> 01:41:14,0
I say unto

100
01:41:14,0 --> 01:41:14,0
you, I

101
01:41:14,0 --> 01:41:14,0
remember my servant

102
01:41:14,0 --> 01:41:14,0
Oliver

103
01:41:14,0 --> 01:41:14,0
Granger; behold,

104
01:41:14,0 --> 01:41:14,0
verily I say

105
01:41:14,0 --> 01:41:14,0
unto him that

106
01:41:14,0 --> 01:41:14,0
his name shall

107
01:41:14,0 --> 01:41:14,0
be had in

108
01:41:14,0 --> 01:41:14,0
sacred

109
01:41:14,0 --> 01:41:14,0
remembrance from

110
01:41:14,0 --> 01:41:14,0
generation to

111
01:41:14,0 --> 01:41:14,0
generation,

112
01:41:14,0 --> 01:41:14,0
forever and ever,

113
01:41:14,0 --> 01:42:18,
saith the Lord.

114
01:42:18,0 --> 01:42:18,0
13

115
01:42:18,0 --> 01:42:18,0
Therefore, let him

116
01:42:18,0 --> 01:42:18,0
contend

117
01:42:18,0 --> 01:42:18,0
earnestly for the

118
01:42:18,0 --> 01:42:18,0
redemption

119
01:42:18,0 --> 01:42:18,0
of the First

120
01:42:18,0 --> 01:42:18,0
Presidency

121
01:42:18,0 --> 01:42:18,0
of my Church,

122
01:42:18,0 --> 01:42:18,0
saith the

123
01:42:18,0 --> 01:42:18,0
Lord; and

124
01:42:18,0 --> 01:42:18,0
when he falls

125
01:42:18,0 --> 01:42:18,0
he shall rise

126
01:42:18,0 --> 01:42:18,0
again, for

127
01:42:18,0 --> 01:42:18,0
his

128
01:42:18,0 --> 01:42:18,0
sacrifice shall be

129
01:42:18,0 --> 01:42:18,0
more sacred

130
01:42:18,0 --> 01:42:18,0
unto me than

131
01:42:18,0 --> 01:49:21,
his increase, saith the Lord.

132
01:49:21,0 --> 01:49:21,0
14

133
01:49:21,0 --> 01:49:21,0
Therefore, let him

134
01:49:21,0 --> 01:49:21,0
come up

135
01:49:21,0 --> 01:49:21,0
hither

136
01:49:21,0 --> 01:49:21,0
speedily, unto the

137
01:49:21,0 --> 01:49:21,0
land of

138
01:49:21,0 --> 01:49:21,0
Zion; and in

139
01:49:21,0 --> 01:49:21,0
the due

140
01:49:21,0 --> 01:49:21,0
time he shall

141
01:49:21,0 --> 01:49:21,0
be made a

142
01:49:21,0 --> 01:49:21,0
merchant

143
01:49:21,0 --> 01:49:21,0
unto my name,

144
01:49:21,0 --> 01:49:21,0
saith the

145
01:49:21,0 --> 01:49:21,0
Lord, for

146
01:49:21,0 --> 01:50:25,
the benefit of my people.

147
01:50:25,0 --> 01:50:25,0
15

148
01:50:25,0 --> 01:50:25,0
Therefore let no

149
01:50:25,0 --> 01:50:25,0
man despise

150
01:50:25,0 --> 01:50:25,0
my servant

151
01:50:25,0 --> 01:50:25,0
Oliver

152
01:50:25,0 --> 01:50:25,0
Granger, but let

153
01:50:25,0 --> 01:50:25,0
the

154
01:50:25,0 --> 01:50:25,0
blessings of my

155
01:50:25,0 --> 01:50:25,0
people be on

156
01:50:25,0 --> 01:50:25,0
him

157
01:50:25,0 --> 01:57:28,
forever and ever.

158
01:57:28,0 --> 01:57:28,0
16 And

159
01:57:28,0 --> 01:57:28,0
again, verily

160
01:57:28,0 --> 01:57:28,0
I say

161
01:57:28,0 --> 01:57:28,0
unto you, let

162
01:57:28,0 --> 01:57:28,0
all my

163
01:57:28,0 --> 01:57:28,0
servants in

164
01:57:28,0 --> 01:57:28,0
the land

165
01:57:28,0 --> 01:57:28,0
of Kirtland

166
01:57:28,0 --> 01:57:28,0
remember

167
01:57:28,0 --> 01:57:28,0
the Lord

168
01:57:28,0 --> 01:57:28,0
their God,

169
01:57:28,0 --> 01:57:28,0
and mine

170
01:57:28,0 --> 01:57:28,0
house also,

171
01:57:28,0 --> 01:57:28,0
to keep

172
01:57:28,0 --> 01:57:28,0
and

173
01:57:28,0 --> 01:57:28,0
preserve it holy,

174
01:57:28,0 --> 01:57:28,0
and to

175
01:57:28,0 --> 01:57:28,0
overthrow

176
01:57:28,0 --> 01:57:28,0
the

177
01:57:28,0 --> 01:57:28,0
moneychangers in

178
01:57:28,0 --> 01:57:28,0
mine own

179
01:57:28,0 --> 01:57:28,0
due time,

180
01:57:28,0 --> 02:12:30,
saith the Lord. Even so. Amen.
