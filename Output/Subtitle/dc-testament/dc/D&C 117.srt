00:00:11,295 --> 00:00:18,545
Section 117 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:18,545 --> 00:00:25,795
 the Prophet, at Far West, Missouri, July 8, 1838,

3
00:00:25,795 --> 00:00:33,045
 concerning the immediate duties of William Marks,

4
00:00:33,045 --> 00:00:40,295
 Newel K. Whitney, and Oliver Granger. 
1–9, The

5
00:00:40,295 --> 00:00:47,545
 Lord’s servants should not covet temporal things,

6
00:00:47,545 --> 00:00:54,795
 for “what is property unto the Lord?”; 
10–16, They

7
00:00:54,795 --> 00:01:02,045
 are to forsake littleness of soul, and their

8
00:01:02,045 --> 00:01:09,295
 sacrifices will be sacred unto the Lord.

9
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:16,319
1 Verily thus saith the Lord unto my servant

10
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:23,119
 William Marks, and also unto my servant Newel K.

11
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:29,919
 Whitney, let them settle up their business speedily and

12
00:01:29,919 --> 00:01:36,719
 journey from the land of Kirtland, before I, the

13
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:43,519
 Lord, send again the snows upon the earth

14
00:01:43,27 --> 00:01:47,27
2 Let them awake, and arise, and come forth, and

15
00:01:47,27 --> 00:01:51,27
 not tarry, for I, the Lord, command it

16
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:55,345
3 Therefore, if they tarry it shall not be well

17
00:01:55,345 --> 00:01:58,845
 with them

18
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:03,952
4 Let them repent of all their sins, and of all

19
00:02:03,952 --> 00:02:09,285
 their covetous desires, before me, saith the Lord;

20
00:02:09,285 --> 00:02:14,618
 for what is property unto me? saith the Lord

21
00:02:14,117 --> 00:02:20,617
5 Let the properties of Kirtland be turned out for

22
00:02:20,617 --> 00:02:27,117
 debts, saith the Lord. Let them go, saith the

23
00:02:27,117 --> 00:02:33,617
 Lord, and whatsoever remaineth, let it remain in your

24
00:02:33,617 --> 00:02:40,117
 hands, saith the Lord

25
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:49,494
6 For have I not the fowls of heaven, and also the

26
00:02:49,494 --> 00:02:58,094
 fish of the sea, and the beasts of the mountains?

27
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:06,694
 Have I not made the earth? Do I not hold the

28
00:03:06,694 --> 00:03:15,294
 destinies of all the armies of the nations of the

29
00:03:15,294 --> 00:03:23,894
 earth

30
00:03:23,87 --> 00:03:30,203
7 Therefore, will I not make solitary places to

31
00:03:30,203 --> 00:03:36,536
 bud and to blossom, and to bring forth in abundance?

32
00:03:36,536 --> 00:03:42,869
 saith the Lord

33
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:48,955
8 Is there not room enough on the mountains of

34
00:03:48,955 --> 00:03:55,755
 Adam-ondi-Ahman, and on the plains of Olaha Shinehah,

35
00:03:55,755 --> 00:04:02,555
 or the land where Adam dwelt, that you should

36
00:04:02,555 --> 00:04:09,355
 covet that which is but the drop, and neglect the

37
00:04:09,355 --> 00:04:16,155
 more weighty matters

38
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:21,156
9 Therefore, come up hither unto the land of my

39
00:04:21,156 --> 00:04:26,156
 people, even Zion

40
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:32,183
10 Let my servant William Marks be faithful over a

41
00:04:32,183 --> 00:04:38,183
 few things, and he shall be a ruler over many.

42
00:04:38,183 --> 00:04:44,183
 Let him preside in the midst of my people in the

43
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:50,183
 city of Far West, and let him be blessed with the

44
00:04:50,183 --> 00:04:56,183
 blessings of my people

45
00:04:56,163 --> 00:05:04,449
11 Let my servant Newel K. Whitney be ashamed of

46
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:12,735
 the Nicolaitane band and of all their secret

47
00:05:12,735 --> 00:05:21,021
 abominations, and of all his littleness of soul before

48
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:29,307
 me, saith the Lord, and come up to the land of

49
00:05:29,307 --> 00:05:37,593
 Adam-ondi-Ahman, and be a bishop unto my people, saith

50
00:05:37,593 --> 00:05:45,879
 the Lord, not in name but in deed, saith the

51
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:54,165
 Lord

52
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:59,388
12 And again, I say unto you, I remember my

53
00:05:59,388 --> 00:06:03,788
 servant Oliver Granger; behold, verily I say unto him

54
00:06:03,788 --> 00:06:08,188
 that his name shall be had in sacred remembrance

55
00:06:08,188 --> 00:06:12,588
 from generation to generation, forever and ever,

56
00:06:12,588 --> 00:06:16,988
 saith the Lord

57
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:23,777
13 Therefore, let him contend earnestly for the

58
00:06:23,777 --> 00:06:30,577
 redemption of the First Presidency of my Church,

59
00:06:30,577 --> 00:06:37,377
 saith the Lord; and when he falls he shall rise

60
00:06:37,377 --> 00:06:44,177
 again, for his sacrifice shall be more sacred unto me

61
00:06:44,177 --> 00:06:50,977
 than his increase, saith the Lord

62
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:54,493
14 Therefore, let him come up hither speedily,

63
00:06:54,493 --> 00:06:58,743
 unto the land of Zion; and in the due time he shall

64
00:06:58,743 --> 00:07:02,993
 be made a merchant unto my name, saith the Lord,

65
00:07:02,993 --> 00:07:07,243
 for the benefit of my people

66
00:07:07,777 --> 00:07:13,777
15 Therefore let no man despise my servant Oliver

67
00:07:13,777 --> 00:07:19,777
 Granger, but let the blessings of my people be on

68
00:07:19,777 --> 00:07:25,777
 him forever and ever

69
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:31,579
16 And again, verily I say unto you, let all my

70
00:07:31,579 --> 00:07:37,379
 servants in the land of Kirtland remember the Lord

71
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:43,179
 their God, and mine house also, to keep and

72
00:07:43,179 --> 00:07:48,979
 preserve it holy, and to overthrow the moneychangers in

73
00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:54,779
 mine own due time, saith the Lord. Even so. Amen.
