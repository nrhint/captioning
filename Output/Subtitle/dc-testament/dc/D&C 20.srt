1
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:18,153
Section 20 Revelation on Church organization and

2
00:00:18,153 --> 00:00:25,028
 government, given through Joseph Smith the Prophet,

3
00:00:25,028 --> 00:00:31,903
 at or near Fayette, New York. Portions of this

4
00:00:31,903 --> 00:00:38,778
 revelation may have been given as early as summer

5
00:00:38,778 --> 00:00:45,653
 1829. The complete revelation, known at the time as

6
00:00:45,653 --> 00:00:52,528
 the Articles and Covenants, was likely recorded

7
00:00:52,528 --> 00:00:59,403
 soon after April 6, 1830 (the day the Church was

8
00:00:59,403 --> 00:01:06,278
 organized). The Prophet wrote, “We obtained of Him

9
00:01:06,278 --> 00:01:13,153
 [Jesus Christ] the following, by the spirit of

10
00:01:13,153 --> 00:01:20,028
 prophecy and revelation; which not only gave us much

11
00:01:20,028 --> 00:01:26,903
 information, but also pointed out to us the precise

12
00:01:26,903 --> 00:01:33,778
 day upon which, according to His will and

13
00:01:33,778 --> 00:01:40,653
 commandment, we should proceed to organize His Church once

14
00:01:40,653 --> 00:01:47,528
 more here upon the earth.”

15
00:01:47,528 --> 00:01:54,403

 are given.

25
00:02:56,777 --> 00:03:00,652
1 The rise of the Church of Christ in these last

26
00:03:00,652 --> 00:03:04,527
 days, being one thousand eight hundred and thirty

27
00:03:04,527 --> 00:03:08,402
 years since the coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus

28
00:03:08,402 --> 00:03:12,277
 Christ in the flesh, it being regularly organized

29
00:03:12,277 --> 00:03:16,152
 and established agreeable to the laws of our

30
00:03:16,152 --> 00:03:20,027
 country, by the will and commandments of God, in the

31
00:03:20,027 --> 00:03:23,902
 fourth month, and on the sixth day of the month

32
00:03:23,902 --> 00:03:27,777
 which is called April

33
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:30,757
2 Which commandments were given to Joseph Smith,

34
00:03:30,757 --> 00:03:34,507
 Jun., who was called of God, and ordained an

35
00:03:34,507 --> 00:03:38,257
 apostle of Jesus Christ, to be the first elder of this

36
00:03:38,257 --> 00:03:42,007
 church

37
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:48,822
3 And to Oliver Cowdery, who was also called of

38
00:03:48,822 --> 00:03:55,155
 God, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to be the second

39
00:03:55,155 --> 00:04:01,488
 elder of this church, and ordained under his hand

40
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:06,742
4 And this according to the grace of our Lord and

41
00:04:06,742 --> 00:04:11,742
 Savior Jesus Christ, to whom be all glory, both

42
00:04:11,742 --> 00:04:16,741
 now and forever. Amen

43
00:04:16,49 --> 00:04:20,99
5 After it was truly manifested unto this first

44
00:04:20,99 --> 00:04:25,49
 elder that he had received a remission of his sins,

45
00:04:25,49 --> 00:04:29,99
 he was entangled again in the vanities of the

46
00:04:29,99 --> 00:04:34,49
 world

47
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:40,041
6 But after repenting, and humbling himself

48
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:45,841
 sincerely, through faith, God ministered unto him by an

49
00:04:45,841 --> 00:04:51,641
 holy angel, whose countenance was as lightning,

50
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:57,441
 and whose garments were pure and white above all

51
00:04:57,441 --> 00:05:03,241
 other whiteness

52
00:05:03,47 --> 00:05:06,47
7 And gave unto him commandments which inspired

53
00:05:06,47 --> 00:05:09,47
 him

54
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:13,21
8 And gave him power from on high, by the means

55
00:05:13,21 --> 00:05:16,877
 which were before prepared, to translate the Book of

56
00:05:16,877 --> 00:05:20,544
 Mormon

57
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:27,221
9 Which contains a record of a fallen people, and

58
00:05:27,221 --> 00:05:33,888
 the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ to the

59
00:05:33,888 --> 00:05:40,555
 Gentiles and to the Jews also

60
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:47,241
10 Which was given by inspiration, and is

61
00:05:47,241 --> 00:05:53,908
 confirmed to others by the ministering of angels, and is

62
00:05:53,908 --> 00:06:00,575
 declared unto the world by them

63
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:06,361
11 Proving to the world that the holy scriptures

64
00:06:06,361 --> 00:06:11,861
 are true, and that God does inspire men and call

65
00:06:11,861 --> 00:06:17,361
 them to his holy work in this age and generation, as

66
00:06:17,361 --> 00:06:22,861
 well as in generations of old

67
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:27,115
12 Thereby showing that he is the same God

68
00:06:27,115 --> 00:06:32,115
 yesterday, today, and forever. Amen

69
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:40,092
13 Therefore, having so great witnesses, by them

70
00:06:40,092 --> 00:06:47,759
 shall the world be judged, even as many as shall

71
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:55,426
 hereafter come to a knowledge of this work

72
00:06:55,882 --> 00:07:00,215
14 And those who receive it in faith, and work

73
00:07:00,215 --> 00:07:04,548
 righteousness, shall receive a crown of eternal life

74
00:07:04,548 --> 00:07:08,881


75
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:12,428
15 But those who harden their hearts in unbelief,

76
00:07:12,428 --> 00:07:16,428
 and reject it, it shall turn to their own

77
00:07:16,428 --> 00:07:20,428
 condemnation

78
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:25,923
16 For the Lord God has spoken it; and we, the

79
00:07:25,923 --> 00:07:31,673
 elders of the church, have heard and bear witness to

80
00:07:31,673 --> 00:07:37,423
 the words of the glorious Majesty on high, to whom

81
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:43,173
 be glory forever and ever. Amen

82
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:50,796
17 By these things we know that there is a God in

83
00:07:50,796 --> 00:07:58,196
 heaven, who is infinite and eternal, from

84
00:07:58,196 --> 00:08:05,596
 everlasting to everlasting the same unchangeable God, the

85
00:08:05,596 --> 00:08:12,996
 framer of heaven and earth, and all things which

86
00:08:12,996 --> 00:08:20,396
 are in them

87
00:08:20,4 --> 00:08:26,067
18 And that he created man, male and female, after

88
00:08:26,067 --> 00:08:31,734
 his own image and in his own likeness, created he

89
00:08:31,734 --> 00:08:37,401
 them

90
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:42,667
19 And gave unto them commandments that they

91
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:47,917
 should love and serve him, the only living and true

92
00:08:47,917 --> 00:08:53,167
 God, and that he should be the only being whom they

93
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:58,417
 should worship

94
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:04,905
20 But by the transgression of these holy laws man

95
00:09:04,905 --> 00:09:10,905
 became sensual and devilish, and became fallen

96
00:09:10,905 --> 00:09:16,905
 man

97
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:23,323
21 Wherefore, the Almighty God gave his Only

98
00:09:23,323 --> 00:09:29,99
 Begotten Son, as it is written in those scriptures

99
00:09:29,99 --> 00:09:36,657
 which have been given of him

100
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:40,142
22 He suffered temptations but gave no heed unto

101
00:09:40,142 --> 00:09:44,142
 them

102
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:50,217
23 He was crucified, died, and rose again the

103
00:09:50,217 --> 00:09:56,217
 third day

104
00:09:56,196 --> 00:10:02,196
24 And ascended into heaven, to sit down on the

105
00:10:02,196 --> 00:10:08,196
 right hand of the Father, to reign with almighty

106
00:10:08,196 --> 00:10:14,196
 power according to the will of the Father

107
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:21,047
25 That as many as would believe and be baptized

108
00:10:21,047 --> 00:10:27,38
 in his holy name, and endure in faith to the end,

109
00:10:27,38 --> 00:10:33,713
 should be saved

110
00:10:33,7 --> 00:10:40,414
26 Not only those who believed after he came in

111
00:10:40,414 --> 00:10:47,128
 the meridian of time, in the flesh, but all those

112
00:10:47,128 --> 00:10:53,842
 from the beginning, even as many as were before he

113
00:10:53,842 --> 00:11:00,556
 came, who believed in the words of the holy

114
00:11:00,556 --> 00:11:07,27
 prophets, who spake as they were inspired by the gift of

115
00:11:07,27 --> 00:11:13,984
 the Holy Ghost, who truly testified of him in all

116
00:11:13,984 --> 00:11:20,698
 things, should have eternal life

117
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:24,863
27 As well as those who should come after, who

118
00:11:24,863 --> 00:11:29,613
 should believe in the gifts and callings of God by

119
00:11:29,613 --> 00:11:34,363
 the Holy Ghost, which beareth record of the Father

120
00:11:34,363 --> 00:11:39,113
 and of the Son

121
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:46,598
28 Which Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are one God,

122
00:11:46,598 --> 00:11:54,098
 infinite and eternal, without end. Amen

123
00:11:54,814 --> 00:12:00,014
29 And we know that all men must repent and

124
00:12:00,014 --> 00:12:05,214
 believe on the name of Jesus Christ, and worship the

125
00:12:05,214 --> 00:12:10,414
 Father in his name, and endure in faith on his name

126
00:12:10,414 --> 00:12:15,614
 to the end, or they cannot be saved in the kingdom

127
00:12:15,614 --> 00:12:20,814
 of God

128
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:25,973
30 And we know that justification through the

129
00:12:25,973 --> 00:12:31,64
 grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is just and

130
00:12:31,64 --> 00:12:37,307
 true

131
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:43,107
31 And we know also, that sanctification through

132
00:12:43,107 --> 00:12:48,857
 the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is

133
00:12:48,857 --> 00:12:54,607
 just and true, to all those who love and serve God

134
00:12:54,607 --> 00:13:00,357
 with all their mights, minds, and strength

135
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:08,579
32 But there is a possibility that man may fall

136
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:17,079
 from grace and depart from the living God

137
00:13:17,83 --> 00:13:23,83
33 Therefore let the church take heed and pray

138
00:13:23,83 --> 00:13:29,83
 always, lest they fall into temptation

139
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:33,608
34 Yea, and even let those who are sanctified take

140
00:13:33,608 --> 00:13:38,108
 heed also

141
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:43,437
35 And we know that these things are true and

142
00:13:43,437 --> 00:13:48,723
 according to the revelations of John, neither adding

143
00:13:48,723 --> 00:13:54,009
 to, nor diminishing from the prophecy of his book,

144
00:13:54,009 --> 00:13:59,295
 the holy scriptures, or the revelations of God

145
00:13:59,295 --> 00:14:04,581
 which shall come hereafter by the gift and power of

146
00:14:04,581 --> 00:14:09,867
 the Holy Ghost, the voice of God, or the

147
00:14:09,867 --> 00:14:15,153
 ministering of angels

148
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:19,755
36 And the Lord God has spoken it; and honor,

149
00:14:19,755 --> 00:14:24,422
 power and glory be rendered to his holy name, both now

150
00:14:24,422 --> 00:14:29,089
 and ever. Amen

151
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:34,602
37 And again, by way of commandment to the church

152
00:14:34,602 --> 00:14:39,602
 concerning the manner of baptism—All those who

153
00:14:39,602 --> 00:14:44,602
 humble themselves before God, and desire to be

154
00:14:44,602 --> 00:14:49,602
 baptized, and come forth with broken hearts and contrite

155
00:14:49,602 --> 00:14:54,602
 spirits, and witness before the church that they

156
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:59,602
 have truly repented of all their sins, and are

157
00:14:59,602 --> 00:15:04,602
 willing to take upon them the name of Jesus Christ,

158
00:15:04,602 --> 00:15:09,602
 having a determination to serve him to the end, and

159
00:15:09,602 --> 00:15:14,602
 truly manifest by their works that they have

160
00:15:14,602 --> 00:15:19,602
 received of the Spirit of Christ unto the remission of

161
00:15:19,602 --> 00:15:24,602
 their sins, shall be received by baptism into his

162
00:15:24,602 --> 00:15:29,602
 church

163
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:37,463
38 The duty of the elders, priests, teachers,

164
00:15:37,463 --> 00:15:45,13
 deacons, and members of the church of Christ—An

165
00:15:45,13 --> 00:15:52,797
 apostle is an elder, and it is his calling to baptize

166
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:57,018
39 And to ordain other elders, priests, teachers,

167
00:15:57,018 --> 00:16:01,518
 and deacons

168
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:06,828
40 And to administer bread and wine—the emblems of

169
00:16:06,828 --> 00:16:11,828
 the flesh and blood of Christ

170
00:16:11,37 --> 00:16:15,62
41 And to confirm those who are baptized into the

171
00:16:15,62 --> 00:16:19,87
 church, by the laying on of hands for the baptism

172
00:16:19,87 --> 00:16:24,12
 of fire and the Holy Ghost, according to the

173
00:16:24,12 --> 00:16:28,37
 scriptures

174
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:32,154
42 And to teach, expound, exhort, baptize, and

175
00:16:32,154 --> 00:16:36,154
 watch over the church

00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:41,729
43 And to confirm the church by the laying on of

177
00:16:41,729 --> 00:16:46,729
 the hands, and the giving of the Holy Ghost

178
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:49,739

 there is no elder present

192
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:50,431
50 But when there is an elder present, he is only

193
00:17:50,431 --> 00:17:55,431

54 And see that there is no iniquity in the

202
00:18:35,043 --> 00:18:39,043
 church, neither hardness with each other, neither lying,

203
00:18:39,043 --> 00:18:43,043

214
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:28,328
59 They are, however, to warn, expound, exhort,

215
00:19:28,328 --> 00:19:34,328

217
00:19:42,04 --> 00:19:49,44

 God unto him; and he is to be ordained by the

219
00:19:56,84 --> 00:20:04,24
 power of the Holy Ghost, which is in the one who

220
00:20:04,24 --> 00:20:11,64

221
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:15,843

63 The elders are to receive their licenses from

228
00:20:43,136 --> 00:20:49,136

230
00:20:55,421 --> 00:21:00,921

231
00:21:00,921 --> 00:21:06,421
 ordained by a priest, may take a certificate from him at

232
00:21:06,421 --> 00:21:11,921
 the time, which certificate, when presented to an

233
00:21:11,921 --> 00:21:17,421
 elder, shall entitle him to a license, which shall

234
00:21:17,421 --> 00:21:22,921
 authorize him to perform the duties of his

235
00:21:22,921 --> 00:21:28,421

236
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:33,654
65 No person is to be ordained to any office in

237
00:21:33,654 --> 00:21:38,654
 this church, where there is a regularly organized

238
00:21:38,654 --> 00:21:43,654
 branch of the same, without the vote of that church

239
00:21:43,654 --> 00:21:48,654


240
00:21:48,14 --> 00:21:54,39
66 But the presiding elders, traveling bishops,

241
00:21:54,39 --> 00:22:00,64

251
00:22:48,528 --> 00:22:53,242
 church of Christ to their understanding, previous

252
00:22:53,242 --> 00:22:57,956
 to their partaking of the sacrament and being

253
00:22:57,956 --> 00:23:02,67

254
00:23:02,67 --> 00:23:07,384

255
00:23:07,62 --> 00:23:14,02
69 And the members shall manifest before the

256
00:23:14,02 --> 00:23:20,42
 church, and also before the elders, by a godly walk and

257
00:23:20,42 --> 00:23:26,82
 conversation, that they are worthy of it, that

258
00:23:26,82 --> 00:23:33,22
 there may be works and faith agreeable to the holy

259
00:23:33,22 --> 00:23:39,62
 scriptures—walking in holiness before the Lord

260
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:43,718
70 Every member of the church of Christ having

261
00:23:43,718 --> 00:23:47,918

 the name of Jesus Christ, and bless them in his

264
00:23:56,318 --> 00:24:00,518
 name

265
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:06,706
71 No one can be received into the church of

266
00:24:06,706 --> 00:24:13,373
 Christ unless he has arrived unto the years of

267
00:24:13,373 --> 00:24:20,04

268
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:25,559
72 Baptism is to be administered in the following

269
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:30,559

271
00:24:37,298 --> 00:24:43,727
 authority from Jesus Christ to baptize, shall go down

272
00:24:43,727 --> 00:24:50,156

00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:56,585
 himself or herself for baptism, and shall say, calling

274
00:24:56,585 --> 00:25:03,014
 him or her by name: Having been commissioned of

275
00:25:03,014 --> 00:25:09,443
 Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the

276
00:25:09,443 --> 00:25:15,872
 Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen

277
00:25:15,08 --> 00:25:19,58
74 Then shall he immerse him or her in the water,

278
00:25:19,58 --> 00:25:24,08
 and come forth again out of the water

279
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:28,623
75 It is expedient that the church meet together

280
00:25:28,623 --> 00:25:32,623
 often to partake of bread and wine in the

281
00:25:32,623 --> 00:25:36,623
 remembrance of the Lord Jesus

282
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:42,185
76 And the elder or priest shall administer it;

283
00:25:42,185 --> 00:25:47,435
 and after this manner shall he administer it—he

284
00:25:47,435 --> 00:25:52,685
 shall kneel with the church and call upon the Father

285
00:25:52,685 --> 00:25:57,935
 in solemn prayer, saying

286
00:25:57,222 --> 00:26:01,722
77 O God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee in the

287
00:26:01,722 --> 00:26:06,222
 name of thy Son, Jesus Christ, to bless and

288
00:26:06,222 --> 00:26:10,722
 sanctify this bread to the souls of all those who partake

289
00:26:10,722 --> 00:26:15,222
 of it, that they may eat in remembrance of the

290
00:26:15,222 --> 00:26:19,722
 body of thy Son, and witness unto thee, O God, the

291
00:26:19,722 --> 00:26:24,222
 Eternal Father, that they are willing to take upon

292
00:26:24,222 --> 00:26:28,722
 them the name of thy Son, and always remember him

293
00:26:28,722 --> 00:26:33,222
 and keep his commandments which he has given them;

294
00:26:33,222 --> 00:26:37,722
 that they may always have his Spirit to be with

295
00:26:37,722 --> 00:26:42,222
 them. Amen

296
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:47,901
78 The manner of administering the wine—he shall

297
00:26:47,901 --> 00:26:53,401
 take the cup also, and say

298
00:26:53,245 --> 00:26:57,995
79 O God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee in the

299
00:26:57,995 --> 00:27:02,745
 name of thy Son, Jesus Christ, to bless and

300
00:27:02,745 --> 00:27:07,495
 sanctify this wine to the souls of all those who drink of

301
00:27:07,495 --> 00:27:12,245
 it, that they may do it in remembrance of the

302
00:27:12,245 --> 00:27:16,995
 blood of thy Son, which was shed for them; that they

303
00:27:16,995 --> 00:27:21,745
 may witness unto thee, O God, the Eternal Father,

304
00:27:21,745 --> 00:27:26,495
 that they do always remember him, that they may

305
00:27:26,495 --> 00:27:31,245
 have his Spirit to be with them. Amen

306
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:36,917
80 Any member of the church of Christ

307
00:27:36,917 --> 00:27:41,917
 transgressing, or being overtaken in a fault, shall be dealt

308
00:27:41,917 --> 00:27:46,917
 with as the scriptures direct

309
00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:53,399
81 It shall be the duty of the several churches,

310
00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:59,899
 composing the church of Christ, to send one or more

311
00:27:59,899 --> 00:28:06,399
