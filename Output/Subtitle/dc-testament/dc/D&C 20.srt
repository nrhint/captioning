00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 20 Revelation on Church organization and

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
government, given through Joseph Smith the

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Prophet, at or near Fayette, New York. Portions of

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
this revelation may have been given as early as

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
summer 1829. The complete revelation, known at

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the time as the Articles and Covenants, was likely

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
recorded soon after April 6, 1830 (the day the

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Church was organized). The Prophet wrote, “We

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
obtained of Him [Jesus Christ] the following, by

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the spirit of prophecy and revelation; which not

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
only gave us much information, but also pointed

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
out to us the precise day upon which, according

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
to His will and commandment, we should proceed

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
to organize His Church once more here upon the

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
earth.” 
1–16, The Book of Mormon proves the

16
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
divinity of the latter-day work; 
17–28, The

17
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
doctrines of creation, fall, atonement, and baptism are

18
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
affirmed; 
29–37, Laws governing repentance,

19
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
justification, sanctification, and baptism are set

20
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
forth; 
38–67, Duties of elders, priests,

21
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
teachers, and deacons are summarized; 
68–74, Duties

22
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of members, blessing of children, and the mode of

23
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
baptism are revealed; 
75–84, Sacramental

24
00:00:00,0 --> 01:27:52,
prayers and regulations governing Church membership are given. 

25
01:27:52,0 --> 01:27:52,0
1 The rise of the Church of Christ in these

26
01:27:52,0 --> 01:27:52,0
last days, being one thousand eight hundred and

27
01:27:52,0 --> 01:27:52,0
thirty years since the coming of our Lord and

28
01:27:52,0 --> 01:27:52,0
Savior Jesus Christ in the flesh, it being

29
01:27:52,0 --> 01:27:52,0
regularly organized and established agreeable to

30
01:27:52,0 --> 01:27:52,0
the laws of our country, by the will and

31
01:27:52,0 --> 01:27:52,0
commandments of God, in the fourth month, and on

32
01:27:52,0 --> 01:31:51,
the sixth day of the month which is called April—

33
01:31:51,0 --> 01:31:51,0
2 Which commandments were given to

34
01:31:51,0 --> 01:31:51,0
Joseph Smith, Jun., who was called of God,

35
01:31:51,0 --> 01:31:51,0
and ordained an apostle of Jesus

36
01:31:51,0 --> 01:39:49,
Christ, to be the first elder of this church;

37
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
3 And to Oliver Cowdery, who was also

38
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
called of God, an apostle of Jesus

39
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
Christ, to be the second elder of this

40
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,
church, and ordained under his hand;

41
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
4 And this according to the

42
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
grace of our Lord and Savior

43
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
Jesus Christ, to whom be all

44
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,
glory, both now and forever. Amen.

45
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
5 After it was truly

46
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
manifested unto this first

47
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
elder that he had received

48
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
a remission of his sins,

49
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
he was entangled again in

50
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,
the vanities of the world;

51
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
6 But after repenting,

52
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
and humbling himself

53
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
sincerely, through faith,

54
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
God ministered unto

55
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
him by an holy angel,

56
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
whose countenance was as

57
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
lightning, and whose

58
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
garments were pure and

59
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,
white above all other whiteness;

60
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
7 And gave unto

61
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
him commandments

62
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,
which inspired him;

63
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
8 And gave him

64
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
power from on

65
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
high, by the

66
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
means which were

67
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
before prepared,

68
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
to translate

69
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,
the Book of Mormon;

70
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
9 Which

71
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
contains a record of

72
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
a fallen

73
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
people, and the

74
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
fulness of the

75
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
gospel of Jesus

76
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
Christ to the

77
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
Gentiles and

78
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,
to the Jews also;

79
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
10 Which was

80
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
given by

81
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
inspiration, and

82
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
is confirmed

83
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
to others by

84
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
the

85
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
ministering of angels,

86
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
and is

87
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
declared unto the

88
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,
world by them—

89
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
11 Proving

90
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
to the world

91
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
that the

92
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
holy scriptures

93
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
are true,

94
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
and that God

95
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
does inspire

96
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
men and

97
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
call them to

98
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
his holy work

99
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
in this age

100
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
and

101
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
generation, as well

102
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,
as in generations of old;

103
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
12 Thereby

104
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
showing

105
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
that he is the

106
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
same God

107
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
yesterday,

108
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
today, and

109
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,
forever. Amen.

110
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
13

111
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
Therefore, having

112
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
so great

113
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
witnesses,

114
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
by them

115
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
shall the

116
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
world be

117
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
judged, even

118
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
as many

119
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
as shall

120
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
hereafter

121
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
come to a

122
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,
knowledge of this work.

123
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
14 And

124
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
those who

125
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
receive it in

126
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
faith,

127
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
and work

128
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0


129
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
righteousness, shall

130
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
receive a

131
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
crown of

132
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,
eternal life;

133
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
15 But

134
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
those who

135
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
harden

136
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
their hearts

137
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
in

138
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
unbelief, and

139
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
reject

140
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
it, it

141
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
shall turn to

142
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
their

143
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,
own condemnation—

144
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
16 For

145
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
the Lord

146
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
God has

147
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
spoken

148
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
it; and

149
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
we, the

150
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
elders of

151
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
the

152
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
church,

153
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
have heard

154
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
and bear

155
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
witness

156
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
to the

157
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
words of

160
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
Majesty on

01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
high,

162
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
to whom

163
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
be glory

164
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,
forever and ever. Amen.

165
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
17 By

166
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
these

167
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
things we

is

175

01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0


179
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
everlasting

180
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
to

181
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
everlasting

182
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
the

183
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
same

184
01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0

01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
God,

01:39:49,0 --> 01:39:49,0
the
