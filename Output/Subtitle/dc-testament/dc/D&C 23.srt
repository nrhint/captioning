desire on the part of the five persons named to

7

9
00:00:56,8 --> 00:01:03,9
each person. 
1–7, These early disciples are

10
00:01:03,9 --> 00:01:11,772
called to preach, exhort, and strengthen the Church. 

11
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:17,022
1 Behold, I speak unto you, Oliver, a few

12
00:01:17,022 --> 00:01:22,272
words. Behold, thou art blessed, and art

13
00:01:22,272 --> 00:01:27,522
under no condemnation. But beware of pride,

14
00:01:27,522 --> 00:01:32,125
lest thou shouldst enter into temptation.

15
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:37,125
2 Make known thy calling unto the

16
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:42,125
church, and also before the world, and thy

17
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:47,125
heart shall be opened to preach the

18
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:52,479
truth from henceforth and forever. Amen.

19
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,229
3 Behold, I speak unto you, Hyrum, a

20
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:59,979
few words; for thou also art under no

21
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:03,729
condemnation, and thy heart is

22
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:07,479
opened, and thy tongue loosed; and thy

23
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:11,229
calling is to exhortation, and to

24
00:02:11,229 --> 00:02:14,979
strengthen the church continually.

25
00:02:14,979 --> 00:02:18,729
Wherefore thy duty is unto the church

26
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:22,709
forever, and this because of thy family. Amen.

27
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:26,709
4 Behold, I speak a few words unto

28
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:30,709
you, Samuel; for thou also art under

29
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:34,709
no condemnation, and thy calling is

30
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:38,709
to exhortation, and to strengthen

31
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:42,709
the church; and thou art not as yet

32
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:46,166
called to preach before the world. Amen.

33
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,666
5 Behold, I speak a few words unto

34
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:53,166
you, Joseph; for thou also art

35
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:56,666
under no condemnation, and thy calling

36
00:02:56,666 --> 00:03:00,166
also is to exhortation, and to

37
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:03,666
strengthen the church; and this is thy

38
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:07,988
duty from henceforth and forever. Amen.

39
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:09,417
6 Behold, I manifest unto you,

40
00:03:09,417 --> 00:03:10,846
Joseph Knight, by these words, that

41
00:03:10,846 --> 00:03:12,275
you must take up your cross, in

42
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,704
the which you must pray vocally

43
00:03:13,704 --> 00:03:15,133
before the world as well as in

44
00:03:15,133 --> 00:03:16,562
secret, and in your family, and

45
00:03:16,562 --> 00:03:17,898
among your friends, and in all places.

46
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:21,731
7 And, behold, it is your

47
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:25,564
duty to unite with the true

48
00:03:25,564 --> 00:03:29,397
church, and give your

49
00:03:29,397 --> 00:03:33,23
language to exhortation

50
00:03:33,23 --> 00:03:37,063
continually, that you may receive

51
00:03:37,063 --> 00:03:40,887
the reward of the laborer. Amen.
