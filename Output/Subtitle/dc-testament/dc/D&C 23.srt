 Samuel H. Smith, Joseph Smith Sr., and Joseph

00:00:35,678 --> 00:00:41,778
 Knight Sr. As the result of earnest desire on the part

00:00:41,778 --> 00:00:47,878
 of the five persons named to know of their

7
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:53,978
 respective duties, the Prophet inquired of the Lord and

00:00:53,978 --> 00:01:00,078
 received a revelation for each person. 
1–7, These

9
00:01:00,078 --> 00:01:06,178
 early disciples are called to preach, exhort, and

10
00:01:06,178 --> 00:01:12,278
 strengthen the Church.

11
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:17,622
1 Behold, I speak unto you, Oliver, a few words.

12
00:01:17,622 --> 00:01:22,872
 Behold, thou art blessed, and art under no

13
00:01:22,872 --> 00:01:28,122
 condemnation. But beware of pride, lest thou shouldst

14
00:01:28,122 --> 00:01:33,372
 enter into temptation

15
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:38,126
2 Make known thy calling unto the church, and also

16
00:01:38,126 --> 00:01:43,126
 before the world, and thy heart shall be opened

17
00:01:43,126 --> 00:01:48,126
 to preach the truth from henceforth and forever.

18
00:01:48,126 --> 00:01:53,126
 Amen

19
00:01:53,88 --> 00:01:59,047
3 Behold, I speak unto you, Hyrum, a few words;

20
00:01:59,047 --> 00:02:04,214
 for thou also art under no condemnation, and thy

21
00:02:04,214 --> 00:02:09,381
 heart is opened, and thy tongue loosed; and thy

22
00:02:09,381 --> 00:02:14,548
 calling is to exhortation, and to strengthen the church

23
00:02:14,548 --> 00:02:19,715
 continually. Wherefore thy duty is unto the

24
00:02:19,715 --> 00:02:24,882
 church forever, and this because of thy family. Amen

25
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:29,211
4 Behold, I speak a few words unto you, Samuel;

26
00:02:29,211 --> 00:02:33,611
 for thou also art under no condemnation, and thy

27
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:38,011
 calling is to exhortation, and to strengthen the

28
00:02:38,011 --> 00:02:42,411
 church; and thou art not as yet called to preach

29
00:02:42,411 --> 00:02:46,811
 before the world. Amen

30
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:50,933
5 Behold, I speak a few words unto you, Joseph;

31
00:02:50,933 --> 00:02:55,333
 for thou also art under no condemnation, and thy

32
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:59,733
 calling also is to exhortation, and to strengthen the

33
00:02:59,733 --> 00:03:04,133
 church; and this is thy duty from henceforth and

34
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:08,533
 forever. Amen

35
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:14,922
6 Behold, I manifest unto you, Joseph Knight, by

36
00:03:14,922 --> 00:03:21,322
 these words, that you must take up your cross, in

37
00:03:21,322 --> 00:03:27,722
 the which you must pray vocally before the world as

38
00:03:27,722 --> 00:03:34,122
 well as in secret, and in your family, and among

39
00:03:34,122 --> 00:03:40,522
 your friends, and in all places

40
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:48,787
7 And, behold, it is your duty to unite with the

41
00:03:48,787 --> 00:03:56,787
 true church, and give your language to exhortation

42
00:03:56,787 --> 00:04:04,787
 continually, that you may receive the reward of

43
00:04:04,787 --> 00:04:12,787
 the laborer. Amen.
