Smith, Samuel H. Smith, Joseph Smith Sr., and

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Joseph Knight Sr. As the result of earnest

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
desire on the part of the five persons named to

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
know of their respective duties, the Prophet

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
inquired of the Lord and received a revelation for

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
each person. 
1–7, These early disciples are

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:35:51,
called to preach, exhort, and strengthen the Church. 

11
00:35:51,0 --> 00:35:51,0
1 Behold, I speak unto you, Oliver, a few

12
00:35:51,0 --> 00:35:51,0
words. Behold, thou art blessed, and art

13
00:35:51,0 --> 00:35:51,0
under no condemnation. But beware of pride,

14
00:35:51,0 --> 00:46:01,
lest thou shouldst enter into temptation.

15
00:46:01,0 --> 00:46:01,0
2 Make known thy calling unto the

16
00:46:01,0 --> 00:46:01,0
church, and also before the world, and thy

17
00:46:01,0 --> 00:46:01,0
heart shall be opened to preach the

18
00:46:01,0 --> 00:56:11,
truth from henceforth and forever. Amen.

19
00:56:11,0 --> 00:56:11,0
3 Behold, I speak unto you, Hyrum, a

20
00:56:11,0 --> 00:56:11,0
few words; for thou also art under no

21
00:56:11,0 --> 00:56:11,0
condemnation, and thy heart is

22
00:56:11,0 --> 00:56:11,0
opened, and thy tongue loosed; and thy

23
00:56:11,0 --> 00:56:11,0
calling is to exhortation, and to

24
00:56:11,0 --> 00:56:11,0
strengthen the church continually.

25
00:56:11,0 --> 00:56:11,0
Wherefore thy duty is unto the church

26
00:56:11,0 --> 01:11:53,
forever, and this because of thy family. Amen.

27
01:11:53,0 --> 01:11:53,0
4 Behold, I speak a few words unto

28
01:11:53,0 --> 01:11:53,0
you, Samuel; for thou also art under

29
01:11:53,0 --> 01:11:53,0
no condemnation, and thy calling is

30
01:11:53,0 --> 01:11:53,0
to exhortation, and to strengthen

31
01:11:53,0 --> 01:11:53,0
the church; and thou art not as yet

32
01:11:53,0 --> 01:22:47,
called to preach before the world. Amen.

33
01:22:47,0 --> 01:22:47,0
5 Behold, I speak a few words unto

34
01:22:47,0 --> 01:22:47,0
you, Joseph; for thou also art

35
01:22:47,0 --> 01:22:47,0
under no condemnation, and thy calling

36
01:22:47,0 --> 01:22:47,0
also is to exhortation, and to

37
01:22:47,0 --> 01:22:47,0
strengthen the church; and this is thy

38
01:22:47,0 --> 01:34:16,
duty from henceforth and forever. Amen.

39
01:34:16,0 --> 01:34:16,0
6 Behold, I manifest unto you,

40
01:34:16,0 --> 01:34:16,0
Joseph Knight, by these words, that

41
01:34:16,0 --> 01:34:16,0
you must take up your cross, in

42
01:34:16,0 --> 01:34:16,0
the which you must pray vocally

43
01:34:16,0 --> 01:34:16,0
before the world as well as in

44
01:34:16,0 --> 01:34:16,0
secret, and in your family, and

45
01:34:16,0 --> 01:49:58,
among your friends, and in all places.

46
01:49:58,0 --> 01:49:58,0
7 And, behold, it is your

47
01:49:58,0 --> 01:49:58,0
duty to unite with the true

48
01:49:58,0 --> 01:49:58,0
church, and give your

49
01:49:58,0 --> 01:49:58,0
language to exhortation

50
01:49:58,0 --> 01:49:58,0
continually, that you may receive

51
01:49:58,0 --> 02:01:55,
the reward of the laborer. Amen.
