00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 121 Prayer and prophecies written by

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Joseph Smith the Prophet in an epistle to the Church

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
while he was a prisoner in the jail at Liberty,

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Missouri, dated March 20, 1839. The Prophet and

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
several companions had been months in prison. Their

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
petitions and appeals directed to the executive

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
officers and the judiciary had failed to bring

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
them relief. 
1–6, The Prophet pleads with the Lord

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
for the suffering Saints; 
7–10, The Lord speaks

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
peace to him; 
11–17, Cursed are all those who

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
raise false cries of transgression against the

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Lord’s people; 
18–25, They will not have right to

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the priesthood and will be damned; 
26–32,

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Glorious revelations promised those who endure

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
valiantly; 
33–40, Why many are called and few are chosen;

16
00:00:00,0 --> 02:20:48,
41–46, The priesthood should be used only in righteousness. 

17
02:20:48,0 --> 02:20:48,0
1 O God, where art thou? And where is the

18
02:20:48,0 --> 02:25:53,
pavilion that covereth thy hiding place?

19
02:25:53,0 --> 02:25:53,0
2 How long shall thy hand be stayed,

20
02:25:53,0 --> 02:25:53,0
and thine eye, yea thy pure eye, behold

21
02:25:53,0 --> 02:25:53,0
from the eternal heavens the wrongs

22
02:25:53,0 --> 02:25:53,0
of thy people and of thy servants, and

23
02:25:53,0 --> 02:32:56,
thine ear be penetrated with their cries?

24
02:32:56,0 --> 02:32:56,0
3 Yea, O Lord, how long shall they

25
02:32:56,0 --> 02:32:56,0
suffer these wrongs and unlawful

26
02:32:56,0 --> 02:32:56,0
oppressions, before thine heart shall be

27
02:32:56,0 --> 02:32:56,0
softened toward them, and thy

28
02:32:56,0 --> 02:57:56,
bowels be moved with compassion toward them?

29
02:57:56,0 --> 02:57:56,0
4 O Lord God Almighty, maker of

30
02:57:56,0 --> 02:57:56,0
heaven, earth, and seas, and of

31
02:57:56,0 --> 02:57:56,0
all things that in them are, and

32
02:57:56,0 --> 02:57:56,0
who controllest and subjectest the

33
02:57:56,0 --> 02:57:56,0
devil, and the dark and benighted

34
02:57:56,0 --> 02:57:56,0
dominion of Sheol—stretch forth

35
02:57:56,0 --> 02:57:56,0
thy hand; let thine eye pierce;

36
02:57:56,0 --> 02:57:56,0
let thy pavilion be taken up; let

37
02:57:56,0 --> 02:57:56,0
thy hiding place no longer be

38
02:57:56,0 --> 02:57:56,0
covered; let thine ear be inclined;

39
02:57:56,0 --> 02:57:56,0
let thine heart be softened, and

40
02:57:56,0 --> 03:04:59,
thy bowels moved with compassion toward us.

41
03:04:59,0 --> 03:04:59,0
5 Let thine anger be kindled

42
03:04:59,0 --> 03:04:59,0
against our enemies; and, in

43
03:04:59,0 --> 03:04:59,0
the fury of thine heart, with

44
03:04:59,0 --> 03:07:33,
thy sword avenge us of our wrongs.

45
03:07:33,0 --> 03:07:33,0
6 Remember thy

46
03:07:33,0 --> 03:07:33,0
suffering saints, O our God;

47
03:07:33,0 --> 03:07:33,0
and thy servants will

48
03:07:33,0 --> 03:03:41,
rejoice in thy name forever.

49
03:03:41,0 --> 03:03:41,0
7 My son, peace be

50
03:03:41,0 --> 03:03:41,0
unto thy soul; thine

51
03:03:41,0 --> 03:03:41,0
adversity and thine

52
03:03:41,0 --> 03:03:41,0
afflictions shall be

53
03:03:41,0 --> 03:04:45,
but a small moment;

54
03:04:45,0 --> 03:04:45,0
8 And then, if

55
03:04:45,0 --> 03:04:45,0
thou endure it

56
03:04:45,0 --> 03:04:45,0
well, God shall exalt

57
03:04:45,0 --> 03:04:45,0
thee on high;

58
03:04:45,0 --> 03:04:45,0
thou shalt triumph

59
03:04:45,0 --> 03:07:47,
over all thy foes.

60
03:07:47,0 --> 03:07:47,0
9 Thy friends do

61
03:07:47,0 --> 03:07:47,0
stand by thee,

62
03:07:47,0 --> 03:07:47,0
and they shall

63
03:07:47,0 --> 03:07:47,0
hail thee again

64
03:07:47,0 --> 03:07:47,0
with warm hearts

65
03:07:47,0 --> 03:07:53,
and friendly hands.

66
03:07:53,0 --> 03:07:53,0
10 Thou art not

67
03:07:53,0 --> 03:07:53,0
yet as Job;

68
03:07:53,0 --> 03:07:53,0
thy friends do

69
03:07:53,0 --> 03:07:53,0
not contend

70
03:07:53,0 --> 03:07:53,0
against thee,

71
03:07:53,0 --> 03:07:53,0
neither charge thee

72
03:07:53,0 --> 03:07:53,0
with

73
03:07:53,0 --> 03:07:59,
transgression, as they did Job.

74
03:07:59,0 --> 03:07:59,0
11 And they

75
03:07:59,0 --> 03:07:59,0
who do charge

76
03:07:59,0 --> 03:07:59,0
thee with

77
03:07:59,0 --> 03:07:59,0
transgression, their

78
03:07:59,0 --> 03:07:59,0
hope shall be

79
03:07:59,0 --> 03:07:59,0
blasted, and

80
03:07:59,0 --> 03:07:59,0
their

81
03:07:59,0 --> 03:07:59,0
prospects shall melt

82
03:07:59,0 --> 03:07:59,0
away as the

83
03:07:59,0 --> 03:07:59,0
hoar frost

84
03:07:59,0 --> 03:07:59,0
melteth before the

85
03:07:59,0 --> 03:07:59,0
burning rays of

86
03:07:59,0 --> 03:07:37,
the rising sun;

87
03:07:37,0 --> 03:07:37,0
12 And also

88
03:07:37,0 --> 03:07:37,0
that God hath

89
03:07:37,0 --> 03:07:37,0
set his hand

90
03:07:37,0 --> 03:07:37,0
and seal to

91
03:07:37,0 --> 03:07:37,0
change the

92
03:07:37,0 --> 03:07:37,0
times and

93
03:07:37,0 --> 03:07:37,0
seasons, and to

94
03:07:37,0 --> 03:07:37,0
blind their

95
03:07:37,0 --> 03:07:37,0
minds, that they

96
03:07:37,0 --> 03:07:37,0
may not

97
03:07:37,0 --> 03:07:37,0
understand his

98
03:07:37,0 --> 03:07:37,0
marvelous

99
03:07:37,0 --> 03:07:37,0
workings; that he

100
03:07:37,0 --> 03:07:37,0
may prove them

101
03:07:37,0 --> 03:07:37,0
also and

102
03:07:37,0 --> 03:07:37,0
take them in

103
03:07:37,0 --> 03:03:45,
their own craftiness;

104
03:03:45,0 --> 03:03:45,0
13 Also

105
03:03:45,0 --> 03:03:45,0
because their

106
03:03:45,0 --> 03:03:45,0
hearts are

107
03:03:45,0 --> 03:03:45,0
corrupted, and

108
03:03:45,0 --> 03:03:45,0
the things

109
03:03:45,0 --> 03:03:45,0
which they

110
03:03:45,0 --> 03:03:45,0
are willing to

111
03:03:45,0 --> 03:03:45,0
bring upon

112
03:03:45,0 --> 03:03:45,0
others, and

113
03:03:45,0 --> 03:03:45,0
love to have

114
03:03:45,0 --> 03:03:45,0
others

115
03:03:45,0 --> 03:03:45,0
suffer, may come

116
03:03:45,0 --> 03:03:45,0
upon

117
03:03:45,0 --> 03:03:45,0
themselves to the

118
03:03:45,0 --> 03:04:49,
very uttermost;

119
03:04:49,0 --> 03:04:49,0
14 That

120
03:04:49,0 --> 03:04:49,0
they may be

121
03:04:49,0 --> 03:04:49,0
disappointed

122
03:04:49,0 --> 03:04:49,0
also, and

123
03:04:49,0 --> 03:04:49,0
their hopes

124
03:04:49,0 --> 03:07:51,
may be cut off;

125
03:07:51,0 --> 03:07:51,0
15 And not

126
03:07:51,0 --> 03:07:51,0
many years

127
03:07:51,0 --> 03:07:51,0
hence, that

128
03:07:51,0 --> 03:07:51,0
they and

129
03:07:51,0 --> 03:07:51,0
their

130
03:07:51,0 --> 03:07:51,0
posterity shall

131
03:07:51,0 --> 03:07:51,0
be swept

132
03:07:51,0 --> 03:07:51,0
from under

133
03:07:51,0 --> 03:07:51,0
heaven, saith

134
03:07:51,0 --> 03:07:51,0
God, that

135
03:07:51,0 --> 03:07:51,0
not one of

136
03:07:51,0 --> 03:07:51,0
them is left

137
03:07:51,0 --> 03:07:51,0
to stand

138
03:07:51,0 --> 03:07:57,
by the wall.

139
03:07:57,0 --> 03:07:57,0
16 Cursed

140
03:07:57,0 --> 03:07:57,0
are all

141
03:07:57,0 --> 03:07:57,0
those that

142
03:07:57,0 --> 03:07:57,0
shall lift

143
03:07:57,0 --> 03:07:57,0
up the

144
03:07:57,0 --> 03:07:57,0
heel against

145
03:07:57,0 --> 03:07:57,0
mine

146
03:07:57,0 --> 03:07:57,0
anointed, saith

147
03:07:57,0 --> 03:07:57,0
the Lord,

148
03:07:57,0 --> 03:07:57,0
and cry

149
03:07:57,0 --> 03:07:57,0
they have

150
03:07:57,0 --> 03:07:57,0
sinned when

151
03:07:57,0 --> 03:07:57,0
they have

152
03:07:57,0 --> 03:07:57,0
not

153
03:07:57,0 --> 03:07:57,0
sinned before

154
03:07:57,0 --> 03:07:57,0
me, saith

155
03:07:57,0 --> 03:07:57,0
the Lord,

156
03:07:57,0 --> 03:07:57,0
but have

157
03:07:57,0 --> 03:07:57,0
done that

158
03:07:57,0 --> 03:07:57,0
which was

159
03:07:57,0 --> 03:07:57,0
meet in mine

160
03:07:57,0 --> 03:07:57,0
eyes, and

161
03:07:57,0 --> 03:07:35,
which I commanded them.

162
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
17 But

163
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
those who

164
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
cry

165
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
transgression

166
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
do it

167
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
because they

168
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
are the

169
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
servants

170
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
of sin,

171
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
and are the

172
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
children

173
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
of

174
03:07:35,0 --> 03:03:43,
disobedience themselves.

175
03:03:43,0 --> 03:03:43,0
18 And

176
03:03:43,0 --> 03:03:43,0
those who

177
03:03:43,0 --> 03:03:43,0
swear

178
03:03:43,0 --> 03:03:43,0
falsely

179
03:03:43,0 --> 03:03:43,0
against

180
03:03:43,0 --> 03:03:43,0
my

181
03:03:43,0 --> 03:03:43,0
servants, that

182
03:03:43,0 --> 03:03:43,0
they

183
03:03:43,0 --> 03:03:43,0
might

184
03:03:43,0 --> 03:03:43,0
bring them

185
03:03:43,0 --> 03:03:43,0
into

186
03:03:43,0 --> 03:04:47,
bondage and death—

187
03:04:47,0 --> 03:04:47,0
19 Wo

188
03:04:47,0 --> 03:04:47,0
unto

189
03:04:47,0 --> 03:04:47,0
them;

190
03:04:47,0 --> 03:04:47,0
because

191
03:04:47,0 --> 03:04:47,0
they have

192
03:04:47,0 --> 03:04:47,0


193
03:04:47,0 --> 03:04:47,0
offended my

194
03:04:47,0 --> 03:04:47,0
little

195
03:04:47,0 --> 03:04:47,0
ones they

196
03:04:47,0 --> 03:04:47,0
shall

197
03:04:47,0 --> 03:04:47,0
be

198
03:04:47,0 --> 03:04:47,0
severed

199
03:04:47,0 --> 03:04:47,0
from the

200
03:04:47,0 --> 03:04:47,0


201
03:04:47,0 --> 03:07:49,
ordinances of mine house.

202
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
20

203
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
Their

204
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
basket

205
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
shall

206
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
not be

207
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
full,

208
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
their

209
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
houses

210
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
and

211
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
their

212
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
barns

213
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
shall

214
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
perish,

215
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
and

216
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
they

217
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0


218
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
themselves

219
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
shall be

220
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0


221
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
despised by

222
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:55,
those that flattered them.

223
03:07:55,0 --> 03:07:55,0
21

224
03:07:55,0 --> 03:07:55,0
