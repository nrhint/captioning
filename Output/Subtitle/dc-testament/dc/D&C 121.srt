1
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:33,243
Section 121 Prayer and prophecies written by

2
00:00:33,243 --> 00:00:40,493
 Joseph Smith the Prophet in an epistle to the Church

3
00:00:40,493 --> 00:00:47,743
 while he was a prisoner in the jail at Liberty,

4
00:00:47,743 --> 00:00:54,993
 Missouri, dated March 20, 1839. The Prophet and

5
00:00:54,993 --> 00:01:02,243
 several companions had been months in prison. Their

6
00:01:02,243 --> 00:01:09,493
 petitions and appeals directed to the executive

7
00:01:09,493 --> 00:01:16,743
 officers and the judiciary had failed to bring them

8
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:23,993
 relief. 
1–6, The Prophet pleads with the Lord for the

9
00:01:23,993 --> 00:01:31,243
 suffering Saints; 
7–10, The Lord speaks peace to

10
00:01:31,243 --> 00:01:38,493
 him; 
11–17, Cursed are all those who raise false

11
00:01:38,493 --> 00:01:45,743
 cries of transgression against the Lord’s people;

12
00:01:45,743 --> 00:01:52,993
18–25, They will not have right to the

13
00:01:52,993 --> 00:02:00,243
 priesthood and will be damned; 
26–32, Glorious revelations

14
00:02:00,243 --> 00:02:07,493
 promised those who endure valiantly; 
33–40, Why

15
00:02:07,493 --> 00:02:14,743
 many are called and few are chosen; 
41–46, The

16
00:02:14,743 --> 00:02:21,993
 priesthood should be used only in righteousness.

17
00:02:21,858 --> 00:02:28,358
1 O God, where art thou? And where is the pavilion

18
00:02:28,358 --> 00:02:34,858
 that covereth thy hiding place

19
00:02:34,871 --> 00:02:44,121
2 How long shall thy hand be stayed, and thine

20
00:02:44,121 --> 00:02:53,371
 eye, yea thy pure eye, behold from the eternal

21
00:02:53,371 --> 00:03:02,621
 heavens the wrongs of thy people and of thy servants,

22
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:11,871
 and thine ear be penetrated with their cries

23
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:18,141
3 Yea, O Lord, how long shall they suffer these

24
00:03:18,141 --> 00:03:25,141
 wrongs and unlawful oppressions, before thine heart

25
00:03:25,141 --> 00:03:32,141
 shall be softened toward them, and thy bowels be

26
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:39,141
 moved with compassion toward them

27
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:46,32
4 O Lord God Almighty, maker of heaven, earth, and

28
00:03:46,32 --> 00:03:52,987
 seas, and of all things that in them are, and who

29
00:03:52,987 --> 00:03:59,654
 controllest and subjectest the devil, and the

30
00:03:59,654 --> 00:04:06,321
 dark and benighted dominion of Sheol—stretch forth

31
00:04:06,321 --> 00:04:12,988
 thy hand; let thine eye pierce; let thy pavilion be

32
00:04:12,988 --> 00:04:19,655
 taken up; let thy hiding place no longer be

33
00:04:19,655 --> 00:04:26,322
 covered; let thine ear be inclined; let thine heart be

34
00:04:26,322 --> 00:04:32,989
 softened, and thy bowels moved with compassion

35
00:04:32,989 --> 00:04:39,656
 toward us

36
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:45,362
5 Let thine anger be kindled against our enemies;

37
00:04:45,362 --> 00:04:51,362
 and, in the fury of thine heart, with thy sword

38
00:04:51,362 --> 00:04:57,362
 avenge us of our wrongs

39
00:04:57,38 --> 00:05:06,88
6 Remember thy suffering saints, O our God; and

40
00:05:06,88 --> 00:05:16,38
 thy servants will rejoice in thy name forever

41
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:21,383
7 My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity

42
00:05:21,383 --> 00:05:26,383
 and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment

43
00:05:26,383 --> 00:05:31,383


44
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:44,998
8 And then, if thou endure it well, God shall

45
00:05:44,998 --> 00:05:58,331
 exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy

46
00:05:58,331 --> 00:06:11,664
 foes

47
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:12,121
9 Thy friends do stand by thee, and they shall

48
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:12,621
 hail thee again with warm hearts and friendly hands

49
00:06:12,022 --> 00:06:16,022
10 Thou art not yet as Job; thy friends do not

50
00:06:16,022 --> 00:06:20,022
 contend against thee, neither charge thee with

51
00:06:20,022 --> 00:06:24,022
 transgression, as they did Job

52
00:06:24,334 --> 00:06:30,834
11 And they who do charge thee with transgression,

53
00:06:30,834 --> 00:06:37,334
 their hope shall be blasted, and their prospects

54
00:06:37,334 --> 00:06:43,834
 shall melt away as the hoar frost melteth before

55
00:06:43,834 --> 00:06:50,334
 the burning rays of the rising sun

56
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:58,244
12 And also that God hath set his hand and seal to

57
00:06:58,244 --> 00:07:05,644
 change the times and seasons, and to blind their

58
00:07:05,644 --> 00:07:13,044
 minds, that they may not understand his marvelous

59
00:07:13,044 --> 00:07:20,444
 workings; that he may prove them also and take

60
00:07:20,444 --> 00:07:27,844
 them in their own craftiness

61
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:32,847
13 Also because their hearts are corrupted, and

62
00:07:32,847 --> 00:07:38,347
 the things which they are willing to bring upon

63
00:07:38,347 --> 00:07:43,847
 others, and love to have others suffer, may come upon

64
00:07:43,847 --> 00:07:49,347
 themselves to the very uttermost

65
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:52,102
14 That they may be disappointed also, and their

66
00:07:52,102 --> 00:07:55,102
 hopes may be cut off

67
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:59,391
15 And not many years hence, that they and their

68
00:07:59,391 --> 00:08:03,641
 posterity shall be swept from under heaven, saith

69
00:08:03,641 --> 00:08:07,891
 God, that not one of them is left to stand by the

70
00:08:07,891 --> 00:08:12,141
 wall

71
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:19,625
16 Cursed are all those that shall lift up the

72
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:26,825
 heel against mine anointed, saith the Lord, and cry

73
00:08:26,825 --> 00:08:34,025
 they have sinned when they have not sinned before

74
00:08:34,025 --> 00:08:41,225
 me, saith the Lord, but have done that which was

75
00:08:41,225 --> 00:08:48,425
 meet in mine eyes, and which I commanded them

76
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:53,694
17 But those who cry transgression do it because

77
00:08:53,694 --> 00:08:59,027
 they are the servants of sin, and are the children

78
00:08:59,027 --> 00:09:04,36
 of disobedience themselves

79
00:09:04,894 --> 00:09:10,561
18 And those who swear falsely against my

80
00:09:10,561 --> 00:09:16,228
 servants, that they might bring them into bondage and

81
00:09:16,228 --> 00:09:21,895
 death

82
00:09:21,678 --> 00:09:28,345
19 Wo unto them; because they have offended my

83
00:09:28,345 --> 00:09:35,012
 little ones they shall be severed from the ordinances

84
00:09:35,012 --> 00:09:41,679
 of mine house

85
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:48,331
20 Their basket shall not be full, their houses

86
00:09:48,331 --> 00:09:54,998
 and their barns shall perish, and they themselves

87
00:09:54,998 --> 00:10:01,665
 shall be despised by those that flattered them

88
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:04,668
21 They shall not have right to the priesthood,

89
00:10:04,668 --> 00:10:07,668
 nor their posterity after them from generation to

90
00:10:07,668 --> 00:10:10,668
 generation

91
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:17,31
22 It had been better for them that a millstone

92
00:10:17,31 --> 00:10:23,643
 had been hanged about their necks, and they drowned

93
00:10:23,643 --> 00:10:29,976
 in the depth of the sea

94
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:36,779
23 Wo unto all those that discomfort my people,

95
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:44,029
 and drive, and murder, and testify against them,

96
00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:51,279
 saith the Lord of Hosts; a generation of vipers shall

97
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:58,529
 not escape the damnation of hell

98
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:02,39
24 Behold, mine eyes see and know all their works,

99
00:11:02,39 --> 00:11:06,723
 and I have in reserve a swift judgment in the

100
00:11:06,723 --> 00:11:11,056
 season thereof, for them all

101
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:19,104
25 For there is a time appointed for every man,

102
00:11:19,104 --> 00:11:26,604
 according as his works shall be

103
00:11:26,87 --> 00:11:32,87
26 God shall give unto you knowledge by his Holy

104
00:11:32,87 --> 00:11:38,87
 Spirit, yea, by the unspeakable gift of the Holy

105
00:11:38,87 --> 00:11:44,87
 Ghost, that has not been revealed since the world

106
00:11:44,87 --> 00:11:50,87
 was until now

107
00:11:50,843 --> 00:12:00,593
27 Which our forefathers have awaited with anxious

108
00:12:00,593 --> 00:12:10,343
 expectation to be revealed in the last times,

109
00:12:10,343 --> 00:12:20,093
 which their minds were pointed to by the angels, as

110
00:12:20,093 --> 00:12:29,843
 held in reserve for the fulness of their glory

111
00:12:29,098 --> 00:12:35,098
28 A time to come in the which nothing shall be

112
00:12:35,098 --> 00:12:41,098
 withheld, whether there be one God or many gods,

113
00:12:41,098 --> 00:12:47,098
 they shall be manifest

114
00:12:47,784 --> 00:12:51,784
29 All thrones and dominions, principalities and

115
00:12:51,784 --> 00:12:55,784
 powers, shall be revealed and set forth upon all

116
00:12:55,784 --> 00:12:59,784
 who have endured valiantly for the gospel of Jesus

117
00:12:59,784 --> 00:13:03,784
 Christ

118
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:10,866
30 And also, if there be bounds set to the heavens

119
00:13:10,866 --> 00:13:17,866
 or to the seas, or to the dry land, or to the

120
00:13:17,866 --> 00:13:24,866
 sun, moon, or stars

121
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:33,054
31 All the times of their revolutions, all the

122
00:13:33,054 --> 00:13:41,221
 appointed days, months, and years, and all the days

123
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:49,388
 of their days, months, and years, and all their

124
00:13:49,388 --> 00:13:57,555
 glories, laws, and set times, shall be revealed in

125
00:13:57,555 --> 00:14:05,722
 the days of the dispensation of the fulness of

126
00:14:05,722 --> 00:14:13,889
 times

127
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:19,985
32 According to that which was ordained in the

128
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:26,818
 midst of the Council of the Eternal God of all other

129
00:14:26,818 --> 00:14:33,651
 gods before this world was, that should be

130
00:14:33,651 --> 00:14:40,484
 reserved unto the finishing and the end thereof, when

131
00:14:40,484 --> 00:14:47,317
 every man shall enter into his eternal presence and

132
00:14:47,317 --> 00:14:54,15
 into his immortal rest

133
00:14:54,66 --> 00:15:02,946
33 How long can rolling waters remain impure? What

134
00:15:02,946 --> 00:15:11,232
 power shall stay the heavens? As well might man

135
00:15:11,232 --> 00:15:19,518
 stretch forth his puny arm to stop the Missouri

136
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:27,804
 river in its decreed course, or to turn it up stream,

137
00:15:27,804 --> 00:15:36,09
 as to hinder the Almighty from pouring down

138
00:15:36,09 --> 00:15:44,376
 knowledge from heaven upon the heads of the Latter-day

139
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:52,662
 Saints

140
00:15:52,135 --> 00:15:57,635
34 Behold, there are many called, but few are

141
00:15:57,635 --> 00:16:03,135
 chosen. And why are they not chosen

142
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:09,229
35 Because their hearts are set so much upon the

143
00:16:09,229 --> 00:16:14,562
 things of this world, and aspire to the honors of

144
00:16:14,562 --> 00:16:19,895
 men, that they do not learn this one lesson

145
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:25,145
36 That the rights of the priesthood are

146
00:16:25,145 --> 00:16:30,645
 inseparably connected with the powers of heaven, and that

147
00:16:30,645 --> 00:16:36,145
 the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor

148
00:16:36,145 --> 00:16:41,645
 handled only upon the principles of righteousness

149
00:16:41,684 --> 00:16:46,906
37 That they may be conferred upon us, it is true;

150
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:52,128
 but when we undertake to cover our sins, or to

151
00:16:52,128 --> 00:16:57,35
 gratify our pride, our vain ambition, or to exercise

152
00:16:57,35 --> 00:17:02,572
 control or dominion or compulsion upon the souls

153
00:17:02,572 --> 00:17:07,794
 of the children of men, in any degree of

154
00:17:07,794 --> 00:17:13,016
 unrighteousness, behold, the heavens withdraw themselves;

155
00:17:13,016 --> 00:17:18,238
 the Spirit of the Lord is grieved; and when it is

156
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:23,46
 withdrawn, Amen to the priesthood or the authority

157
00:17:23,46 --> 00:17:28,682
 of that man

158
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:38,248
38 Behold, ere he is aware, he is left unto

159
00:17:38,248 --> 00:17:47,581
 himself, to kick against the pricks, to persecute the

160
00:17:47,581 --> 00:17:56,914
 saints, and to fight against God

161
00:17:56,175 --> 00:18:01,575
39 We have learned by sad experience that it is

162
00:18:01,575 --> 00:18:06,975
 the nature and disposition of almost all men, as

163
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:12,375
 soon as they get a little authority, as they suppose,

164
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:17,775
 they will immediately begin to exercise

165
00:18:17,775 --> 00:18:23,175
 unrighteous dominion

166
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:30,919
40 Hence many are called, but few are chosen

167
00:18:30,926 --> 00:18:36,926
41 No power or influence can or ought to be

168
00:18:36,926 --> 00:18:42,926
 maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by

169
00:18:42,926 --> 00:18:48,926
 persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness,

170
00:18:48,926 --> 00:18:54,926
 and by love unfeigned

171
00:18:54,9 --> 00:18:59,9
42 By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall

172
00:18:59,9 --> 00:19:04,9
 greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy, and

173
00:19:04,9 --> 00:19:09,9
 without guile

174
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:13,915
43 Reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved

175
00:19:13,915 --> 00:19:18,415
 upon by the Holy Ghost; and then showing forth

176
00:19:18,415 --> 00:19:22,915
 afterwards an increase of love toward him whom thou

177
00:19:22,915 --> 00:19:27,415
 hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy

178
00:19:27,183 --> 00:19:33,183
44 That he may know that thy faithfulness is

179
00:19:33,183 --> 00:19:39,183
 stronger than the cords of death

180
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:47,478
45 Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards

181
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:55,478
 all men, and to the household of faith, and let

182
00:19:55,478 --> 00:20:03,478
 virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall

183
00:20:03,478 --> 00:20:11,478
 thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God;

184
00:20:11,478 --> 00:20:19,478
 and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil

185
00:20:19,478 --> 00:20:27,478
 upon thy soul as the dews from heaven

186
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:34,226
46 The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion,

187
00:20:34,226 --> 00:20:41,026
 and thy scepter an unchanging scepter of

188
00:20:41,026 --> 00:20:47,826
 righteousness and truth; and thy dominion shall be an

189
00:20:47,826 --> 00:20:54,626
 everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it

190
00:20:54,626 --> 00:21:01,426
 shall flow unto thee forever and ever.
