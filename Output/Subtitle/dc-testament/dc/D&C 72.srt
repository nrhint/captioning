verses 24 through 26 were given, providing

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
instructions concerning the gathering to Zion. 
1–8,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Elders are to render an account of their

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
stewardship unto the bishop; 
9–15, The bishop keeps the

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
storehouse and cares for the poor and needy;

6
00:00:00,0 --> 01:58:49,
16–26, Bishops are to certify the worthiness of elders. 

7
01:58:49,0 --> 01:58:49,0
1 Hearken, and listen to the voice of the

8
01:58:49,0 --> 01:58:49,0
Lord, O ye who have assembled yourselves

9
01:58:49,0 --> 01:58:49,0
together, who are the high priests of my church,

10
01:58:49,0 --> 01:59:53,
to whom the kingdom and power have been given.

11
01:59:53,0 --> 01:59:53,0
2 For verily thus saith the Lord, it is

12
01:59:53,0 --> 01:59:53,0
expedient in me for a bishop to be

13
01:59:53,0 --> 01:59:53,0
appointed unto you, or of you, unto the

14
01:59:53,0 --> 02:10:53,
church in this part of the Lord’s vineyard.

15
02:10:53,0 --> 02:10:53,0
3 And verily in this thing ye have

16
02:10:53,0 --> 02:10:53,0
done wisely, for it is required of

17
02:10:53,0 --> 02:10:53,0
the Lord, at the hand of every

18
02:10:53,0 --> 02:10:53,0
steward, to render an account of his

19
02:10:53,0 --> 02:14:31,
stewardship, both in time and in eternity.

20
02:14:31,0 --> 02:14:31,0
4 For he who is faithful and

21
02:14:31,0 --> 02:14:31,0
wise in time is accounted

22
02:14:31,0 --> 02:14:31,0
worthy to inherit the mansions

23
02:14:31,0 --> 02:18:10,
prepared for him of my Father.

24
02:18:10,0 --> 02:18:10,0
5 Verily I say unto you, the

25
02:18:10,0 --> 02:18:10,0
elders of the church in

26
02:18:10,0 --> 02:18:10,0
this part of my vineyard shall

27
02:18:10,0 --> 02:18:10,0
render an account of their

28
02:18:10,0 --> 02:18:10,0

29
02:18:10,0 --> 02:18:10,0
who shall be appointed of me

30
02:18:10,0 --> 02:37:47,

31
02:37:47,0 --> 02:37:47,0
6 These things shall be had

32
02:37:47,0 --> 02:37:47,0

33
02:37:47,0 --> 03:00:47,
over unto the bishop in Zion.

34
03:00:47,0 --> 03:00:47,0
7 And the duty of the

35
03:00:47,0 --> 03:00:47,0

8 And now, verily I

40
03:01:51,0 --> 03:01:51,0
say unto you, my

41
03:01:51,0 --> 03:01:51,0

45
03:01:51,0 --> 03:01:51,0
This is the will of

46
03:01:51,0 --> 03:01:51,0
the Lord your God,

47
03:01:51,0 --> 03:10:54,
your Redeemer. Even so. Amen.
