1
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:48,834
verses 24 through 26 were given, providing

2
00:00:48,834 --> 00:01:03,167
 instructions concerning the gathering to Zion. 
1–8,

3
00:01:03,167 --> 00:01:17,5
 Elders are to render an account of their stewardship

4
00:01:17,5 --> 00:01:31,833
 unto the bishop; 
9–15, The bishop keeps the

5
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:46,166
 storehouse and cares for the poor and needy; 
16–26,

6
00:01:46,166 --> 00:02:00,499
 Bishops are to certify the worthiness of elders.

7
00:02:00,904 --> 00:02:05,654
1 Hearken, and listen to the voice of the Lord, O

8
00:02:05,654 --> 00:02:10,404
 ye who have assembled yourselves together, who are

9
00:02:10,404 --> 00:02:15,154
 the high priests of my church, to whom the

10
00:02:15,154 --> 00:02:19,904
 kingdom and power have been given

11
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:24,189
2 For verily thus saith the Lord, it is expedient

12
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:28,939
 in me for a bishop to be appointed unto you, or of

13
00:02:28,939 --> 00:02:33,689
 you, unto the church in this part of the Lord’s

14
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:38,439
 vineyard

15
00:02:38,442 --> 00:02:44,692
3 And verily in this thing ye have done wisely,

16
00:02:44,692 --> 00:02:50,942
 for it is required of the Lord, at the hand of every

17
00:02:50,942 --> 00:02:57,192
 steward, to render an account of his stewardship,

18
00:02:57,192 --> 00:03:03,442
 both in time and in eternity

19
00:03:03,45 --> 00:03:09,45
4 For he who is faithful and wise in time is

20
00:03:09,45 --> 00:03:15,45
 accounted worthy to inherit the mansions prepared for

21
00:03:15,45 --> 00:03:21,45
 him of my Father

22
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:27,968
5 Verily I say unto you, the elders of the church

23
00:03:27,968 --> 00:03:33,968
 in this part of my vineyard shall render an

24
00:03:33,968 --> 00:03:39,968
 account of their stewardship unto the bishop, who shall

25
00:03:39,968 --> 00:03:45,968
 be appointed of me in this part of my vineyard

26
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:50,709
6 These things shall be had on record, to be

27
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:55,709
 handed over unto the bishop in Zion

28
00:03:55,719 --> 00:04:00,386
7 And the duty of the bishop shall be made known

29
00:04:00,386 --> 00:04:05,053
 by the commandments which have been given, and the

30
00:04:05,053 --> 00:04:09,72
 voice of the conference

31
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:15,983
8 And now, verily I say unto you, my servant

32
00:04:15,983 --> 00:04:22,483
 Newel K. Whitney is the man who shall be appointed and

33
00:04:22,483 --> 00:04:28,983
 ordained unto this power. This is the will of the

34
00:04:28,983 --> 00:04:35,483
 Lord your God, your Redeemer. Even so. Amen

35
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:39,992
9 The word of the Lord, in addition to the law

36
00:04:39,992 --> 00:04:44,742
 which has been given, making known the duty of the

37
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:49,492
 bishop who has been ordained unto the church in this

38
00:04:49,492 --> 00:04:54,242
 part of the vineyard, which is verily this

39
00:04:54,995 --> 00:05:00,995
10 To keep the Lord’s storehouse; to receive the

40
00:05:00,995 --> 00:05:06,995
 funds of the church in this part of the vineyard

41
00:05:06,99 --> 00:05:12,99
11 To take an account of the elders as before has

42
00:05:12,99 --> 00:05:18,99
 been commanded; and to administer to their wants,

43
00:05:18,99 --> 00:05:24,99
 who shall pay for that which they receive,

44
00:05:24,99 --> 00:05:30,99
 inasmuch as they have wherewith to pay

45
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:34,247
12 That this also may be consecrated to the good

46
00:05:34,247 --> 00:05:38,247
 of the church, to the poor and needy

47
00:05:38,555 --> 00:05:42,805
13 And he who hath not wherewith to pay, an

48
00:05:42,805 --> 00:05:47,055
 account shall be taken and handed over to the bishop of

49
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:51,305
 Zion, who shall pay the debt out of that which the

50
00:05:51,305 --> 00:05:55,555
 Lord shall put into his hands

51
00:05:55,572 --> 00:06:01,372
14 And the labors of the faithful who labor in

52
00:06:01,372 --> 00:06:07,172
 spiritual things, in administering the gospel and the

53
00:06:07,172 --> 00:06:12,972
 things of the kingdom unto the church, and unto

54
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:18,772
 the world, shall answer the debt unto the bishop in

55
00:06:18,772 --> 00:06:24,572
 Zion

56
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:29,417
15 Thus it cometh out of the church, for according

57
00:06:29,417 --> 00:06:34,75
 to the law every man that cometh up to Zion must

58
00:06:34,75 --> 00:06:40,083
 lay all things before the bishop in Zion

59
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:45,867
16 And now, verily I say unto you, that as every

60
00:06:45,867 --> 00:06:50,867
 elder in this part of the vineyard must give an

61
00:06:50,867 --> 00:06:55,867
 account of his stewardship unto the bishop in this

62
00:06:55,867 --> 00:07:00,867
 part of the vineyard

63
00:07:00,136 --> 00:07:05,936
17 A certificate from the judge or bishop in this

64
00:07:05,936 --> 00:07:11,736
 part of the vineyard, unto the bishop in Zion,

65
00:07:11,736 --> 00:07:17,536
 rendereth every man acceptable, and answereth all

66
00:07:17,536 --> 00:07:23,336
 things, for an inheritance, and to be received as a

67
00:07:23,336 --> 00:07:29,136
 wise steward and as a faithful laborer

68
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:34,383
18 Otherwise he shall not be accepted of the

69
00:07:34,383 --> 00:07:38,883
 bishop of Zion

70
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:42,858
19 And now, verily I say unto you, let every elder

71
00:07:42,858 --> 00:07:47,525
 who shall give an account unto the bishop of the

72
00:07:47,525 --> 00:07:52,192
 church in this part of the vineyard be recommended

73
00:07:52,192 --> 00:07:56,859
 by the church or churches, in which he labors,

74
00:07:56,859 --> 00:08:01,526
 that he may render himself and his accounts approved

75
00:08:01,526 --> 00:08:06,193
 in all things

76
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:11,486
20 And again, let my servants who are appointed as

77
00:08:11,486 --> 00:08:16,736
 stewards over the literary concerns of my church

78
00:08:16,736 --> 00:08:21,986
 have claim for assistance upon the bishop or

79
00:08:21,986 --> 00:08:27,236
 bishops in all things

80
00:08:27,24 --> 00:08:30,74
21 That the revelations may be published, and go

81
00:08:30,74 --> 00:08:34,24
 forth unto the ends of the earth; that they also

82
00:08:34,24 --> 00:08:37,74
 may obtain funds which shall benefit the church in

83
00:08:37,74 --> 00:08:41,24
 all things

84
00:08:41,237 --> 00:08:47,737
22 That they also may render themselves approved

85
00:08:47,737 --> 00:08:54,237
 in all things, and be accounted as wise stewards

86
00:08:54,017 --> 00:08:59,017
23 And now, behold, this shall be an ensample for

87
00:08:59,017 --> 00:09:04,017
 all the extensive branches of my church, in

88
00:09:04,017 --> 00:09:09,017
 whatsoever land they shall be established. And now I

89
00:09:09,017 --> 00:09:14,017
 make an end of my sayings. Amen

90
00:09:14,003 --> 00:09:19,003
24 A few words in addition to the laws of the

91
00:09:19,003 --> 00:09:24,003
 kingdom, respecting the members of the church—they

92
00:09:24,003 --> 00:09:29,003
 that are appointed by the Holy Spirit to go up unto

93
00:09:29,003 --> 00:09:34,003
 Zion, and they who are privileged to go up unto

94
00:09:34,003 --> 00:09:39,003
 Zion

95
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,996
25 Let them carry up unto the bishop a certificate

96
00:09:41,996 --> 00:09:43,996
 from three elders of the church, or a certificate

97
00:09:43,996 --> 00:09:45,996
 from the bishop

98
00:00:11,328 --> 00:00:11,328
verses 9 through 23 were received, giving

99
00:00:11,328 --> 00:00:11,328
 additional information as to a bishop’s duties.

100
00:00:11,328 --> 00:00:11,328
 Thereafter,

101
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:11,245
Verses 1 through 8 make known the calling of

102
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:11,245
 Newel K. Whitney as a bishop. He was then called and

103
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:11,245
 ordained, after which

104
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:09,412
Section 72 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

105
00:00:09,412 --> 00:00:07,579
 the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, December 4, 1831.

106
00:00:07,579 --> 00:00:05,746
 Several elders and members had assembled to learn

107
00:00:05,746 --> 00:00:03,913
 their duty and to be further edified in the

108
00:00:03,913 --> 00:00:02,08
 teachings of the Church. This section is a compilation of

109
00:00:02,08 --> 00:00:00,247
 three revelations received on the same day.
