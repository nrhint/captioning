00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:18,361
Section 115 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:25,444
 the Prophet, at Far West, Missouri, April 26,

3
00:00:25,444 --> 00:00:32,527
 1838, making known the will of God concerning the

4
00:00:32,527 --> 00:00:39,61
 building up of that place and of the Lord’s house.

5
00:00:39,61 --> 00:00:46,693
 This revelation is addressed to the presiding

6
00:00:46,693 --> 00:00:53,776
 officers and the members of the Church. 
1–4, The Lord

7
00:00:53,776 --> 00:01:00,859
 names His church The Church of Jesus Christ of

8
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:07,942
 Latter-day Saints; 
5–6, Zion and her stakes are places

9
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:15,025
 of defense and refuge for the Saints; 
7–16, The

10
00:01:15,025 --> 00:01:22,108
 Saints are commanded to build a house of the Lord

11
00:01:22,108 --> 00:01:29,191
 at Far West; 
17–19, Joseph Smith holds the keys

12
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:36,274
 of the kingdom of God on earth.

13
00:01:36,446 --> 00:01:42,196
1 Verily thus saith the Lord unto you, my servant

14
00:01:42,196 --> 00:01:47,946
 Joseph Smith, Jun., and also my servant Sidney

15
00:01:47,946 --> 00:01:53,696
 Rigdon, and also my servant Hyrum Smith, and your

16
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:59,446
 counselors who are and shall be appointed hereafter

17
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:04,703
2 And also unto you, my servant Edward Partridge,

18
00:02:04,703 --> 00:02:09,703
 and his counselors

19
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:16,113
3 And also unto my faithful servants who are of

20
00:02:16,113 --> 00:02:22,513
 the high council of my church in Zion, for thus it

21
00:02:22,513 --> 00:02:28,913
 shall be called, and unto all the elders and people

22
00:02:28,913 --> 00:02:35,313
 of my Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day

23
00:02:35,313 --> 00:02:41,713
 Saints, scattered abroad in all the world

24
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:45,395
4 For thus shall my church be called in the last

25
00:02:45,395 --> 00:02:49,062
 days, even The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day

26
00:02:49,062 --> 00:02:52,729
 Saints

27
00:02:52,022 --> 00:02:57,022
5 Verily I say unto you all: Arise and shine

28
00:02:57,022 --> 00:03:02,022
 forth, that thy light may be a standard for the

29
00:03:02,022 --> 00:03:07,022
 nations

30
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:12,621
6 And that the gathering together upon the land of

31
00:03:12,621 --> 00:03:17,621
 Zion, and upon her stakes, may be for a defense,

32
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:22,621
 and for a refuge from the storm, and from wrath

33
00:03:22,621 --> 00:03:27,621
 when it shall be poured out without mixture upon the

34
00:03:27,621 --> 00:03:32,621
 whole earth

35
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:38,812
7 Let the city, Far West, be a holy and

36
00:03:38,812 --> 00:03:45,479
 consecrated land unto me; and it shall be called most holy,

37
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:52,146
 for the ground upon which thou standest is holy

38
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:57,132
8 Therefore, I command you to build a house unto

39
00:03:57,132 --> 00:04:02,132
 me, for the gathering together of my saints, that

40
00:04:02,132 --> 00:04:07,132
 they may worship me

41
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:11,214
9 And let there be a beginning of this work, and a

42
00:04:11,214 --> 00:04:14,547
 foundation, and a preparatory work, this

43
00:04:14,547 --> 00:04:17,88
 following summer

44
00:04:17,407 --> 00:04:20,657
10 And let the beginning be made on the fourth day

45
00:04:20,657 --> 00:04:23,907
 of July next; and from that time forth let my

46
00:04:23,907 --> 00:04:27,157
 people labor diligently to build a house unto my

47
00:04:27,157 --> 00:04:30,407
 name

48
00:04:30,921 --> 00:04:37,921
11 And in one year from this day let them

49
00:04:37,921 --> 00:04:44,921
 re-commence laying the foundation of my house

50
00:04:44,434 --> 00:04:49,934
12 Thus let them from that time forth labor

51
00:04:49,934 --> 00:04:55,434
 diligently until it shall be finished, from the

52
00:04:55,434 --> 00:05:00,934
 cornerstone thereof unto the top thereof, until there

53
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:06,434
 shall not anything remain that is not finished

54
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:16,189
13 Verily I say unto you, let not my servant

55
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:26,189
 Joseph, neither my servant Sidney, neither my servant

56
00:05:26,189 --> 00:05:36,189
 Hyrum, get in debt any more for the building of a

57
00:05:36,189 --> 00:05:46,189
 house unto my name

58
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:46,146
14 But let a house be built unto my name according

59
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:46,146
 to the pattern which I will show unto them

60
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,812
15 And if my people build it not according to the

61
00:05:50,812 --> 00:05:55,145
 pattern which I shall show unto their presidency,

62
00:05:55,145 --> 00:05:59,478
 I will not accept it at their hands

63
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:05,743
16 But if my people do build it according to the

64
00:06:05,743 --> 00:06:11,493
 pattern which I shall show unto their presidency,

65
00:06:11,493 --> 00:06:17,243
 even my servant Joseph and his counselors, then I

66
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:22,993
 will accept it at the hands of my people

67
00:06:22,499 --> 00:06:27,832
17 And again, verily I say unto you, it is my will

68
00:06:27,832 --> 00:06:33,165
 that the city of Far West should be built up

69
00:06:33,165 --> 00:06:38,498
 speedily by the gathering of my saints

70
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:42,731
18 And also that other places should be appointed

71
00:06:42,731 --> 00:06:46,981
 for stakes in the regions round about, as they

72
00:06:46,981 --> 00:06:51,231
 shall be manifested unto my servant Joseph, from time

73
00:06:51,231 --> 00:06:55,481
 to time

74
00:06:55,015 --> 00:07:00,015
19 For behold, I will be with him, and I will

75
00:07:00,015 --> 00:07:05,015
 sanctify him before the people; for unto him have I

76
00:07:05,015 --> 00:07:10,015
 given the keys of this kingdom and ministry. Even

77
00:07:10,015 --> 00:07:15,015
 so. Amen.
