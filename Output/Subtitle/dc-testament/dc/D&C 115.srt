servants who are of the high council

22
01:35:37,0 --> 01:35:37,0
of my church in Zion, for thus it

23
01:35:37,0 --> 01:35:37,0
shall be called, and unto all the

24
01:35:37,0 --> 01:35:37,0
elders and people of my Church

25
01:35:37,0 --> 01:35:37,0
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day

26
01:35:37,0 --> 01:58:38,
Saints, scattered abroad in all the world;

27
01:58:38,0 --> 01:58:38,0
4 For thus shall my church

28
01:58:38,0 --> 01:58:38,0
be called in the last days,

29
01:58:38,0 --> 01:58:38,0
even The Church of Jesus

30
01:58:38,0 --> 02:09:11,
Christ of Latter-day Saints.

31
02:09:11,0 --> 02:09:11,0
5 Verily I say unto you

32
02:09:11,0 --> 02:09:11,0
all: Arise and shine

33
02:09:11,0 --> 02:09:11,0
forth, that thy light may be a

34
02:09:11,0 --> 02:16:14,
standard for the nations;

35
02:16:14,0 --> 02:16:14,0
6 And that the

36
02:16:14,0 --> 02:16:14,0
gathering together upon the

37
02:16:14,0 --> 02:16:14,0
land of Zion, and upon her

38
02:16:14,0 --> 02:16:14,0
stakes, may be for a

39
02:16:14,0 --> 02:16:14,0
defense, and for a

40
02:16:14,0 --> 02:16:14,0
refuge from the storm, and

41
02:16:14,0 --> 02:16:14,0
from wrath when it shall

42
02:16:14,0 --> 02:16:14,0
be poured out without

43
02:16:14,0 --> 02:38:17,
mixture upon the whole earth.

44
02:38:17,0 --> 02:38:17,0
7 Let the city, Far

45
02:38:17,0 --> 02:38:17,0
West, be a holy and

46
02:38:17,0 --> 02:38:17,0
consecrated land unto

47
02:38:17,0 --> 02:38:17,0
me; and it shall be

48
02:38:17,0 --> 02:38:17,0
called most holy, for

49
02:38:17,0 --> 02:38:17,0
the ground upon which

50
02:38:17,0 --> 02:39:21,
thou standest is holy.

51
02:39:21,0 --> 02:39:21,0
8 Therefore, I

52
02:39:21,0 --> 02:39:21,0
command you to build a

53
02:39:21,0 --> 02:39:21,0
house unto me, for

54
02:39:21,0 --> 02:39:21,0
the gathering

55
02:39:21,0 --> 02:39:21,0
together of my saints,

56
02:39:21,0 --> 02:40:25,
that they may worship me.

57
02:40:25,0 --> 02:40:25,0
9 And let there be

58
02:40:25,0 --> 02:40:25,0
a beginning of

59
02:40:25,0 --> 02:40:25,0
this work, and a

60
02:40:25,0 --> 02:40:25,0
foundation, and a

61
02:40:25,0 --> 02:40:25,0
preparatory work,

62
02:40:25,0 --> 02:51:26,
this following summer;

63
02:51:26,0 --> 02:51:26,0
10 And let the

64
02:51:26,0 --> 02:51:26,0
beginning be made

65
02:51:26,0 --> 02:51:26,0
on the fourth

66
02:51:26,0 --> 02:51:26,0
day of July next;

67
02:51:26,0 --> 02:51:26,0
and from that

68
02:51:26,0 --> 02:51:26,0
time forth let my

69
02:51:26,0 --> 02:51:26,0
people labor

70
02:51:26,0 --> 02:51:26,0
diligently to

71
02:51:26,0 --> 03:05:30,
build a house unto my name;

72
03:05:30,0 --> 03:05:30,0
11 And in one

73
03:05:30,0 --> 03:05:30,0
year from this

74
03:05:30,0 --> 03:05:30,0
day let them

75
03:05:30,0 --> 03:05:30,0
re-commence

76
03:05:30,0 --> 03:05:30,0
laying the

77
03:05:30,0 --> 03:01:38,
foundation of my house.

78
03:01:38,0 --> 03:01:38,0
12 Thus let

79
03:01:38,0 --> 03:01:38,0
them from that

80
03:01:38,0 --> 03:01:38,0
time forth

81
03:01:38,0 --> 03:01:38,0
labor

82
03:01:38,0 --> 03:01:38,0
diligently until it

83
03:01:38,0 --> 03:01:38,0
shall be

84
03:01:38,0 --> 03:01:38,0
finished, from the

85
03:01:38,0 --> 03:01:38,0
cornerstone

86
03:01:38,0 --> 03:01:38,0
thereof unto

87
03:01:38,0 --> 03:01:38,0
the top

88
03:01:38,0 --> 03:01:38,0
thereof, until

89
03:01:38,0 --> 03:01:38,0
there shall not

90
03:01:38,0 --> 03:01:38,0

91
03:01:38,0 --> 03:05:45,
remain that is not finished.

92
03:05:45,0 --> 03:05:45,0
13 Verily I

93
03:05:45,0 --> 03:05:45,0
say unto

94
03:05:45,0 --> 03:05:45,0
you, let not my

95

Sidney,

99
03:05:45,0 --> 03:05:45,0
neither my

100
03:05:45,0 --> 03:05:45,0

101
03:05:45,0 --> 03:05:45,0
get in debt

102
03:05:45,0 --> 03:05:45,0
any more for

103
03:05:45,0 --> 03:05:45,0
the building

104
03:05:45,0 --> 03:30:46,
of a house unto my name;

105
03:30:46,0 --> 03:30:46,0
14 But let

106
03:30:46,0 --> 03:30:46,0
a house be

107
03:30:46,0 --> 03:30:46,0
built unto

108
03:30:46,0 --> 03:30:46,0
my name

109
03:30:46,0 --> 03:30:46,0
according to

110
03:30:46,0 --> 03:30:46,0
the pattern

111
03:30:46,0 --> 03:30:46,0
which I

112
03:30:46,0 --> 03:51:21,
will show unto them.

113
03:51:21,0 --> 03:51:21,0
15 And if

114
03:51:21,0 --> 03:51:21,0
my people

115
03:51:21,0 --> 03:51:21,0
build it

116
03:51:21,0 --> 03:51:21,0
not

117
03:51:21,0 --> 03:51:21,0
according to the

118
03:51:21,0 --> 03:51:21,0

123
03:51:21,0 --> 03:51:21,0
I will not

124
03:51:21,0 --> 03:51:21,0
accept it

125
03:51:21,0 --> 04:06:23,
at their hands.

126
04:06:23,0 --> 04:06:23,0
16 But if

127
04:06:23,0 --> 04:06:23,0

128
04:06:23,0 --> 04:06:23,0
do build

129
04:06:23,0 --> 04:06:23,0
it

130
04:06:23,0 --> 04:06:23,0
according to the

131
04:06:23,0 --> 04:06:23,0

132
04:06:23,0 --> 04:06:23,0
which I shall

133
04:06:23,0 --> 04:06:23,0
show unto
