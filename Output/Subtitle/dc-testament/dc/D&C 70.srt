00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 70 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Prophet, at Hiram, Ohio, November 12, 1831.

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
The Prophet’s history states that four special

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
conferences were held from the 1st to the 12th of

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
November, inclusive. In the last of these

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
assemblies, the great importance of the revelations that

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
would later be published as the Book of

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Commandments and then the Doctrine and Covenants was

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
considered. This revelation was given after the

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
conference voted that the revelations were “worth to the

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Church the riches of the whole Earth.” Joseph

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Smith’s history refers to the revelations as “the

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
foundation of the Church in these last days, and a

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
benefit to the world, showing that the keys of

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the mysteries of the kingdom of our Savior are

16
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
again entrusted to man.” 
1–5, Stewards are

17
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
appointed to publish the revelations; 
6–13, Those who

18
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
labor in spiritual things are worthy of their hire;

19
00:00:00,0 --> 02:16:47,
14–18, The Saints should be equal in temporal things. 

20
02:16:47,0 --> 02:16:47,0
1 Behold, and hearken, O ye inhabitants of

21
02:16:47,0 --> 02:16:47,0
Zion, and all ye people of my church who are afar

22
02:16:47,0 --> 02:16:47,0
off, and hear the word of the Lord which I

23
02:16:47,0 --> 02:16:47,0
give unto my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and

24
02:16:47,0 --> 02:16:47,0
also unto my servant Martin Harris, and also unto

25
02:16:47,0 --> 02:16:47,0
my servant Oliver Cowdery, and also unto my

26
02:16:47,0 --> 02:16:47,0
servant John Whitmer, and also unto my servant

27
02:16:47,0 --> 02:16:47,0
Sidney Rigdon, and also unto my servant

28
02:16:47,0 --> 02:43:45,
William W. Phelps, by the way of commandment unto them.

29
02:43:45,0 --> 02:43:45,0
2 For I give unto them a

30
02:43:45,0 --> 02:43:45,0
commandment; wherefore hearken and hear,

31
02:43:45,0 --> 02:55:51,
for thus saith the Lord unto them—

32
02:55:51,0 --> 02:55:51,0
3 I, the Lord, have appointed

33
02:55:51,0 --> 02:55:51,0
them, and ordained them to be

34
02:55:51,0 --> 02:55:51,0
stewards over the revelations

35
02:55:51,0 --> 02:55:51,0
and commandments which I have

36
02:55:51,0 --> 02:55:51,0
given unto them, and which I

37
02:55:51,0 --> 02:51:31,
shall hereafter give unto them;

38
02:51:31,0 --> 02:51:31,0
4 And an account of this

39
02:51:31,0 --> 02:51:31,0
stewardship will I require of

40
02:51:31,0 --> 02:56:36,
them in the day of judgment.

41
02:56:36,0 --> 02:56:36,0
5 Wherefore, I have

42
02:56:36,0 --> 02:56:36,0
appointed unto them, and this is

43
02:56:36,0 --> 02:56:36,0
their business in the

44
02:56:36,0 --> 02:56:36,0
church of God, to manage them

45
02:56:36,0 --> 02:56:36,0
and the concerns thereof,

46
02:56:36,0 --> 03:05:39,
yea, the benefits thereof.

47
03:05:39,0 --> 03:05:39,0
6 Wherefore, a

48
03:05:39,0 --> 03:05:39,0
commandment I give unto them,

49
03:05:39,0 --> 03:05:39,0
that they shall not give

50
03:05:39,0 --> 03:05:39,0
these things unto the

51
03:05:39,0 --> 03:25:44,
church, neither unto the world;

52
03:25:44,0 --> 03:25:44,0
7 Nevertheless,

53
03:25:44,0 --> 03:25:44,0
inasmuch as they receive more

54
03:25:44,0 --> 03:25:44,0
than is needful for

55
03:25:44,0 --> 03:25:44,0
their necessities and

56
03:25:44,0 --> 03:25:44,0
their wants, it shall be

57
03:25:44,0 --> 03:37:50,
given into my storehouse;

58
03:37:50,0 --> 03:37:50,0
8 And the benefits

59
03:37:50,0 --> 03:37:50,0
shall be consecrated

60
03:37:50,0 --> 03:37:50,0
unto the inhabitants

61
03:37:50,0 --> 03:37:50,0
of Zion, and unto

62
03:37:50,0 --> 03:37:50,0
their generations,

63
03:37:50,0 --> 03:37:50,0
inasmuch as they

64
03:37:50,0 --> 03:37:50,0
become heirs according to

65
03:37:50,0 --> 03:57:27,
the laws of the kingdom.

66
03:57:27,0 --> 03:57:27,0
9 Behold, this is

67
03:57:27,0 --> 03:57:27,0
what the Lord

68
03:57:27,0 --> 03:57:27,0
requires of every man

69
03:57:27,0 --> 03:57:27,0
in his

70
03:57:27,0 --> 03:57:27,0
stewardship, even as I, the

71
03:57:27,0 --> 03:57:27,0
Lord, have

72
03:57:27,0 --> 03:57:27,0
appointed or shall

73
03:57:27,0 --> 04:09:05,
hereafter appoint unto any man.

74
04:09:05,0 --> 04:09:05,0
10 And behold,

75
04:09:05,0 --> 04:09:05,0
none are exempt

76
04:09:05,0 --> 04:09:05,0
from this law who

77
04:09:05,0 --> 04:09:05,0
belong to the

78
04:09:05,0 --> 04:22:09,
church of the living God;

79
04:22:09,0 --> 04:22:09,0
11 Yea, neither

80
04:22:09,0 --> 04:22:09,0
the bishop,

81
04:22:09,0 --> 04:22:09,0
neither the agent

82
04:22:09,0 --> 04:22:09,0
who keepeth the

83
04:22:09,0 --> 04:22:09,0
Lord’s storehouse,

84
04:22:09,0 --> 04:22:09,0
neither he who

85
04:22:09,0 --> 04:22:09,0
is appointed in

86
04:22:09,0 --> 04:22:09,0
a stewardship

87
04:22:09,0 --> 04:36:43,
over temporal things.

88
04:36:43,0 --> 04:36:43,0
12 He who is

89
04:36:43,0 --> 04:36:43,0
appointed to

90
04:36:43,0 --> 04:36:43,0
administer

91
04:36:43,0 --> 04:36:43,0
spiritual things, the

92
04:36:43,0 --> 04:36:43,0
same is worthy

93
04:36:43,0 --> 04:36:43,0
of his hire,

94
04:36:43,0 --> 04:36:43,0
even as those who

95
04:36:43,0 --> 04:36:43,0
are appointed

96
04:36:43,0 --> 04:36:43,0
to a stewardship

97
04:36:43,0 --> 04:36:43,0
to administer

98
04:36:43,0 --> 04:37:47,
in temporal things;

99
04:37:47,0 --> 04:37:47,0
13 Yea, even

100
04:37:47,0 --> 04:37:47,0
more

101
04:37:47,0 --> 04:37:47,0
abundantly, which

102
04:37:47,0 --> 04:37:47,0
abundance is

103
04:37:47,0 --> 04:37:47,0
multiplied unto

104
04:37:47,0 --> 04:37:47,0
them through

105
04:37:47,0 --> 04:37:47,0
the

106
04:37:47,0 --> 04:56:19,
manifestations of the Spirit.

107
04:56:19,0 --> 04:56:19,0
14

108
04:56:19,0 --> 04:56:19,0
Nevertheless, in your

109
04:56:19,0 --> 04:56:19,0
temporal

110
04:56:19,0 --> 04:56:19,0
things you

111
04:56:19,0 --> 04:56:19,0
shall be equal,

112
04:56:19,0 --> 04:56:19,0
and this

113
04:56:19,0 --> 04:56:19,0
not

114
04:56:19,0 --> 04:56:19,0
grudgingly, otherwise

115
04:56:19,0 --> 04:56:19,0
the

116
04:56:19,0 --> 04:56:19,0
abundance of the

117
04:56:19,0 --> 04:56:19,0
manifestations

118
04:56:19,0 --> 04:56:19,0
of the

119
04:56:19,0 --> 05:03:21,
Spirit shall be withheld.

120
05:03:21,0 --> 05:03:21,0
15 Now,

121
05:03:21,0 --> 05:03:21,0
this

122
05:03:21,0 --> 05:03:21,0
commandment I give

123
05:03:21,0 --> 05:03:21,0
unto my

124
05:03:21,0 --> 05:03:21,0
servants for

125
05:03:21,0 --> 05:03:21,0
their benefit

126
05:03:21,0 --> 05:03:21,0
while they

127
05:03:21,0 --> 05:03:21,0
remain,

128
05:03:21,0 --> 05:03:21,0
for a

129
05:03:21,0 --> 05:03:21,0
manifestation of

130
05:03:21,0 --> 05:03:21,0
my blessings

131
05:03:21,0 --> 05:03:21,0
upon their

132
05:03:21,0 --> 05:03:21,0
heads, and

133
05:03:21,0 --> 05:03:21,0
for a

134
05:03:21,0 --> 05:03:21,0
reward of their

135
05:03:21,0 --> 05:03:21,0
diligence

136
05:03:21,0 --> 05:07:00,
and for their security;

137
05:07:00,0 --> 05:07:00,0
16 For

138
05:07:00,0 --> 05:07:00,0
food and for

139
05:07:00,0 --> 05:07:00,0
raiment;

140
05:07:00,0 --> 05:07:00,0
for an

141
05:07:00,0 --> 05:07:00,0
inheritance;

142
05:07:00,0 --> 05:07:00,0
for houses

143
05:07:00,0 --> 05:07:00,0
and for

144
05:07:00,0 --> 05:07:00,0
lands, in

145
05:07:00,0 --> 05:07:00,0
whatsoever

146
05:07:00,0 --> 05:07:00,0


147
05:07:00,0 --> 05:07:00,0
circumstances I, the

148
05:07:00,0 --> 05:07:00,0
Lord,

149
05:07:00,0 --> 05:07:00,0
shall place

150
05:07:00,0 --> 05:07:00,0
them, and

151
05:07:00,0 --> 05:07:00,0


152
05:07:00,0 --> 05:07:00,0
whithersoever I, the

153
05:07:00,0 --> 05:17:33,
Lord, shall send them.

154
05:17:33,0 --> 05:17:33,0
17 For

155
05:17:33,0 --> 05:17:33,0
they have

156
05:17:33,0 --> 05:17:33,0
been

157
05:17:33,0 --> 05:17:33,0
faithful over

158
05:17:33,0 --> 05:17:33,0
many

159
05:17:33,0 --> 05:17:33,0
things, and

160
05:17:33,0 --> 05:17:33,0
have done

161
05:17:33,0 --> 05:17:33,0
well

162
05:17:33,0 --> 05:17:33,0
inasmuch as

163
05:17:33,0 --> 05:17:33,0
they have

164
05:17:33,0 --> 05:19:37,
not sinned.

165
05:19:37,0 --> 05:19:37,0
18

166
05:19:37,0 --> 05:19:37,0
Behold, I,

167
05:19:37,0 --> 05:19:37,0
the Lord,

168
05:19:37,0 --> 05:19:37,0
am

169
05:19:37,0 --> 05:19:37,0
merciful and

170
05:19:37,0 --> 05:19:37,0
will

171
05:19:37,0 --> 05:19:37,0
bless them,

172
05:19:37,0 --> 05:19:37,0
and

173
05:19:37,0 --> 05:19:37,0
they shall

174
05:19:37,0 --> 05:19:37,0
enter

175
05:19:37,0 --> 05:19:37,0
into the

176
05:19:37,0 --> 05:19:37,0
joy of

177
05:19:37,0 --> 05:19:37,0
these

178
05:19:37,0 --> 05:17:43,
things. Even so. Amen.
