00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:17,91
Section 70 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:17,91 --> 00:00:24,542
 the Prophet, at Hiram, Ohio, November 12, 1831. The

3
00:00:24,542 --> 00:00:31,174
 Prophet’s history states that four special

4
00:00:31,174 --> 00:00:37,806
 conferences were held from the 1st to the 12th of

5
00:00:37,806 --> 00:00:44,438
 November, inclusive. In the last of these assemblies,

6
00:00:44,438 --> 00:00:51,07
 the great importance of the revelations that would

7
00:00:51,07 --> 00:00:57,702
 later be published as the Book of Commandments and

8
00:00:57,702 --> 00:01:04,334
 then the Doctrine and Covenants was considered.

9
00:01:04,334 --> 00:01:10,966
 This revelation was given after the conference voted

10
00:01:10,966 --> 00:01:17,598
 that the revelations were “worth to the Church

11
00:01:17,598 --> 00:01:24,23
 the riches of the whole Earth.” Joseph Smith’s

12
00:01:24,23 --> 00:01:30,862
 history refers to the revelations as “the foundation of

13
00:01:30,862 --> 00:01:37,494
 the Church in these last days, and a benefit to

14
00:01:37,494 --> 00:01:44,126
 the world, showing that the keys of the mysteries

15
00:01:44,126 --> 00:01:50,758
 of the kingdom of our Savior are again entrusted to

16
00:01:50,758 --> 00:01:57,39
 man.” 
1–5, Stewards are appointed to publish the

17
00:01:57,39 --> 00:02:04,022
 revelations; 
6–13, Those who labor in spiritual

18
00:02:04,022 --> 00:02:10,654
 things are worthy of their hire; 
14–18, The

19
00:02:10,654 --> 00:02:17,286
 Saints should be equal in temporal things.

20
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:22,082
1 Behold, and hearken, O ye inhabitants of Zion,

21
00:02:22,082 --> 00:02:26,526
 and all ye people of my church who are afar off,

22
00:02:26,526 --> 00:02:30,97
 and hear the word of the Lord which I give unto my

23
00:02:30,97 --> 00:02:35,414
 servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and also unto my

24
00:02:35,414 --> 00:02:39,858
 servant Martin Harris, and also unto my servant Oliver

25
00:02:39,858 --> 00:02:44,302
 Cowdery, and also unto my servant John Whitmer, and

26
00:02:44,302 --> 00:02:48,746
 also unto my servant Sidney Rigdon, and also unto

27
00:02:48,746 --> 00:02:53,19
 my servant William W. Phelps, by the way of

28
00:02:53,19 --> 00:02:57,634
 commandment unto them

29
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,594
2 For I give unto them a commandment; wherefore

30
00:03:00,594 --> 00:03:03,594
 hearken and hear, for thus saith the Lord unto them

31
00:03:03,594 --> 00:03:06,594


32
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:11,887
3 I, the Lord, have appointed them, and ordained

33
00:03:11,887 --> 00:03:16,887
 them to be stewards over the revelations and

34
00:03:16,887 --> 00:03:21,887
 commandments which I have given unto them, and which I

35
00:03:21,887 --> 00:03:26,887
 shall hereafter give unto them

36
00:03:26,39 --> 00:03:32,39
4 And an account of this stewardship will I

37
00:03:32,39 --> 00:03:38,39
 require of them in the day of judgment

38
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:43,435
5 Wherefore, I have appointed unto them, and this

39
00:03:43,435 --> 00:03:48,185
 is their business in the church of God, to manage

40
00:03:48,185 --> 00:03:52,935
 them and the concerns thereof, yea, the benefits

41
00:03:52,935 --> 00:03:57,685
 thereof

42
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:01,704
6 Wherefore, a commandment I give unto them, that

43
00:04:01,704 --> 00:04:05,704
 they shall not give these things unto the church,

44
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:09,704
 neither unto the world

45
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:13,866
7 Nevertheless, inasmuch as they receive more than

46
00:04:13,866 --> 00:04:18,199
 is needful for their necessities and their wants,

47
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:22,532
 it shall be given into my storehouse

48
00:04:22,813 --> 00:04:27,063
8 And the benefits shall be consecrated unto the

49
00:04:27,063 --> 00:04:31,313
 inhabitants of Zion, and unto their generations,

50
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:35,563
 inasmuch as they become heirs according to the laws

51
00:04:35,563 --> 00:04:39,813
 of the kingdom

52
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:43,612
9 Behold, this is what the Lord requires of every

53
00:04:43,612 --> 00:04:48,112
 man in his stewardship, even as I, the Lord, have

54
00:04:48,112 --> 00:04:52,612
 appointed or shall hereafter appoint unto any man

55
00:04:52,612 --> 00:04:57,112


56
00:04:57,113 --> 00:05:02,113
10 And behold, none are exempt from this law who

57
00:05:02,113 --> 00:05:07,113
 belong to the church of the living God

58
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:12,074
11 Yea, neither the bishop, neither the agent who

59
00:05:12,074 --> 00:05:16,741
 keepeth the Lord’s storehouse, neither he who is

60
00:05:16,741 --> 00:05:21,408
 appointed in a stewardship over temporal things

61
00:05:21,938 --> 00:05:25,938
12 He who is appointed to administer spiritual

62
00:05:25,938 --> 00:05:29,938
 things, the same is worthy of his hire, even as those

63
00:05:29,938 --> 00:05:33,938
 who are appointed to a stewardship to administer

64
00:05:33,938 --> 00:05:37,938
 in temporal things

65
00:05:37,687 --> 00:05:41,687
13 Yea, even more abundantly, which abundance is

66
00:05:41,687 --> 00:05:45,687
 multiplied unto them through the manifestations of

67
00:05:45,687 --> 00:05:49,687
 the Spirit

68
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:53,499
14 Nevertheless, in your temporal things you shall

69
00:05:53,499 --> 00:05:57,249
 be equal, and this not grudgingly, otherwise the

70
00:05:57,249 --> 00:06:00,999
 abundance of the manifestations of the Spirit

71
00:06:00,999 --> 00:06:04,749
 shall be withheld

72
00:06:04,514 --> 00:06:10,014
15 Now, this commandment I give unto my servants

73
00:06:10,014 --> 00:06:15,514
 for their benefit while they remain, for a

74
00:06:15,514 --> 00:06:21,014
 manifestation of my blessings upon their heads, and for a

75
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:26,514
 reward of their diligence and for their security

76
00:06:26,503 --> 00:06:31,253
16 For food and for raiment; for an inheritance;

77
00:06:31,253 --> 00:06:36,003
 for houses and for lands, in whatsoever

78
00:06:36,003 --> 00:06:40,753
 circumstances I, the Lord, shall place them, and

79
00:06:40,753 --> 00:06:45,503
 whithersoever I, the Lord, shall send them

80
00:06:45,272 --> 00:06:48,605
17 For they have been faithful over many things,

81
00:06:48,605 --> 00:06:51,938
 and have done well inasmuch as they have not

82
00:06:51,938 --> 00:06:55,271
 sinned

83
00:06:55,799 --> 00:07:00,132
18 Behold, I, the Lord, am merciful and will bless

84
00:07:00,132 --> 00:07:04,465
 them, and they shall enter into the joy of these

85
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:08,798
 things. Even so. Amen.
