 Joseph Smith the Prophet and his brother, Hyrum Smith

00:00:24,295 --> 00:00:30,795
 the Patriarch, at Carthage, Illinois, June 27,

4
00:00:30,795 --> 00:00:37,295
 1844. This document was included at the end of the

5
00:00:37,295 --> 00:00:43,795
 1844 edition of the Doctrine and Covenants, which was

6
00:00:43,795 --> 00:00:50,295
 nearly ready for publication when Joseph and

7
00:00:50,295 --> 00:00:56,795
 Hyrum Smith were murdered.

 work. 
twelfth chapter of Ether, in the Book of

12
00:01:22,795 --> 00:01:29,295
 Mormon, and turned down the leaf upon it

13
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:39,832
1 To seal the testimony of this book and the Book

14
00:01:39,832 --> 00:01:49,741
 of Mormon, we announce the martyrdom of Joseph

15
00:01:49,741 --> 00:01:59,65
 Smith the Prophet, and Hyrum Smith the Patriarch.

16
00:01:59,65 --> 00:02:09,559
 They were shot in Carthage jail, on the 27th of June,

17
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:19,468
 1844, about five o’clock p.m., by an armed

18
00:02:19,468 --> 00:02:29,377
 mob—painted black—of from 150 to 200 persons. Hyrum was

19
00:02:29,377 --> 00:02:39,286
 shot first and fell calmly, exclaiming: I am a

20
00:02:39,286 --> 00:02:49,195
 dead man! Joseph leaped from the window, and was shot

21
00:02:49,195 --> 00:02:59,104
 dead in the attempt, exclaiming: O Lord my God!

22
00:02:59,104 --> 00:03:09,013
 They were both shot after they were dead, in a

23
00:03:09,013 --> 00:03:18,922
 brutal manner, and both received four balls

24
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:26,098
2 John Taylor and Willard Richards, two of the

25
00:03:26,098 --> 00:03:33,598
 Twelve, were the only persons in the room at the

26
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:41,098
 time; the former was wounded in a savage manner with

27
00:03:41,098 --> 00:03:48,598
 four balls, but has since recovered; the latter,

28
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:56,098
 through the providence of God, escaped, without even

29
00:03:56,098 --> 00:04:03,598
 a hole in his robe

30
00:04:03,126 --> 00:04:09,936
3 Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord,

31
00:04:09,936 --> 00:04:16,746
 has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation

32
00:04:16,746 --> 00:04:23,556
 of men in this world, than any other man that ever

33
00:04:23,556 --> 00:04:30,366
 lived in it. In the short space of twenty years,

34
00:04:30,366 --> 00:04:37,176
 he has brought forth the Book of Mormon, which he

35
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:43,986
 translated by the gift and power of God, and has

36
00:04:43,986 --> 00:04:50,796
 been the means of publishing it on two continents;

37
00:04:50,796 --> 00:04:57,606
 has sent the fulness of the everlasting gospel,

38
00:04:57,606 --> 00:05:04,416
 which it contained, to the four quarters of the

39
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:11,226
 earth; has brought forth the revelations and

40
00:05:11,226 --> 00:05:18,036
 commandments which compose this book of Doctrine and

41
00:05:18,036 --> 00:05:24,846
 Covenants, and many other wise documents and

42
00:05:24,846 --> 00:05:31,656
 instructions for the benefit of the children of men; gathered

43
00:05:31,656 --> 00:05:38,466
 many thousands of the Latter-day Saints, founded

44
00:05:38,466 --> 00:05:45,276
 a great city, and left a fame and name that cannot

45
00:05:45,276 --> 00:05:52,086
 be slain. He lived great, and he died great in

46
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:58,896
 the eyes of God and his people; and like most of the

47
00:05:58,896 --> 00:06:05,706
 Lord’s anointed in ancient times, has sealed his

48
00:06:05,706 --> 00:06:12,516
 mission and his works with his own blood; and so

49
00:06:12,516 --> 00:06:19,326
 has his brother Hyrum. In life they were not

50
00:06:19,326 --> 00:06:26,136
 divided, and in death they were not separated

51
00:06:26,97 --> 00:06:37,697
4 When Joseph went to Carthage to deliver himself

52
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:48,424
 up to the pretended requirements of the law, two

53
00:06:48,424 --> 00:06:59,151
 or three days previous to his assassination, he

54
00:06:59,151 --> 00:07:09,878
 said: “I am going like a lamb to the slaughter; but I

55
00:07:09,878 --> 00:07:20,605
 am calm as a summer’s morning; I have a

56
00:07:20,605 --> 00:07:31,332
 conscience void of offense towards God, and towards all

57
00:07:31,332 --> 00:07:42,059
 men. I shall die innocent, and it shall yet be said

58
00:07:42,059 --> 00:07:52,786
 of me—he was murdered in cold blood.”—The same

59
00:07:52,786 --> 00:08:03,513
 morning, after Hyrum had made ready to go—shall it be

60
00:08:03,513 --> 00:08:14,24
 said to the slaughter? yes, for so it was—he read

61
00:08:14,24 --> 00:08:24,967
 the following paragraph, near the close of the

62
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:31,371
5 And it came to pass that I prayed unto the Lord

63
00:08:31,371 --> 00:08:38,371
 that he would give unto the Gentiles grace, that

64
00:08:38,371 --> 00:08:45,371
 they might have charity. And it came to pass that

65
00:08:45,371 --> 00:08:52,371
 the Lord said unto me: If they have not charity it

66
00:08:52,371 --> 00:08:59,371
 mattereth not unto thee, thou hast been faithful;

67
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:06,371
 wherefore thy garments shall be made clean. And

68
00:09:06,371 --> 00:09:13,371
 because thou hast seen thy weakness, thou shalt be

69
00:09:13,371 --> 00:09:20,371
 made strong, even unto the sitting down in the

70
00:09:20,371 --> 00:09:27,371
 place which I have prepared in the mansions of my

71
00:09:27,371 --> 00:09:34,371
 Father. And now I … bid farewell unto the Gentiles;

72
00:09:34,371 --> 00:09:41,371
 yea, and also unto my brethren whom I love, until we

73
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:48,371
 shall meet before the judgment-seat of Christ,

74
00:09:48,371 --> 00:09:55,371
 where all men shall know that my garments are not

75
00:09:55,371 --> 00:10:02,371
 spotted with your blood. The testators are now dead,

76
00:10:02,371 --> 00:10:09,371
 and their testament is in force

77
00:10:09,058 --> 00:10:18,191
6 Hyrum Smith was forty-four years old in

78
00:10:18,191 --> 00:10:27,324
 February, 1844, and Joseph Smith was thirty-eight in

79
00:10:27,324 --> 00:10:36,457
 December, 1843; and henceforward their names will be

80
00:10:36,457 --> 00:10:45,59
 classed among the martyrs of religion; and the

81
00:10:45,59 --> 00:10:54,723
 reader in every nation will be reminded that the Book

82
00:10:54,723 --> 00:11:03,856
 of Mormon, and this book of Doctrine and Covenants

83
00:11:03,856 --> 00:11:12,989
 of the church, cost the best blood of the

84
00:11:12,989 --> 00:11:22,122
 nineteenth century to bring them forth for the salvation

85
00:11:22,122 --> 00:11:31,255
 of a ruined world; and that if the fire can scathe

86
00:11:31,255 --> 00:11:40,388
 a green tree for the glory of God, how easy it

87
00:11:40,388 --> 00:11:49,521
 will burn up the dry trees to purify the vineyard of

88
00:11:49,521 --> 00:11:58,654
 corruption. They lived for glory; they died for

89
00:11:58,654 --> 00:12:07,787
 glory; and glory is their eternal reward. From age

90
00:12:07,787 --> 00:12:16,92
 to age shall their names go down to posterity as

91
00:12:16,92 --> 00:12:26,053
 gems for the sanctified

92
00:12:26,93 --> 00:12:33,152
7 They were innocent of any crime, as they had

93
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:39,374
 often been proved before, and were only confined in

94
00:12:39,374 --> 00:12:45,596
 jail by the conspiracy of traitors and wicked men;

95
00:12:45,596 --> 00:12:51,818
 and their innocent blood on the floor of Carthage

96
00:12:51,818 --> 00:12:58,04
 jail is a broad seal affixed to “Mormonism” that

97
00:12:58,04 --> 00:13:04,262
 cannot be rejected by any court on earth, and their

98
00:13:04,262 --> 00:13:10,484
 innocent blood on the escutcheon of the State of

99
00:13:10,484 --> 00:13:16,706
 Illinois, with the broken faith of the State as

100
00:13:16,706 --> 00:13:22,928
 pledged by the governor, is a witness to the truth

101
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:29,15
 of the everlasting gospel that all the world cannot

102
00:13:29,15 --> 00:13:35,372
 impeach; and their innocent blood on the banner

103
00:13:35,372 --> 00:13:41,594
 of liberty, and on the magna charta of the United

104
00:13:41,594 --> 00:13:47,816
 States, is an ambassador for the religion of Jesus

105
00:13:47,816 --> 00:13:54,038
 Christ, that will touch the hearts of honest men

106
00:13:54,038 --> 00:14:00,26
 among all nations; and their innocent blood, with

107
00:14:00,26 --> 00:14:06,482
 the innocent blood of all the martyrs under the

108
00:14:06,482 --> 00:14:12,704
 altar that John saw, will cry unto the Lord of Hosts

109
00:14:12,704 --> 00:14:18,926
 till he avenges that blood on the earth. Amen.
