Joseph Smith the Prophet and his brother, Hyrum Smith

the Patriarch, at Carthage, Illinois, June 27,

00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
1844. This document was included at the end of the

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
1844 edition of the Doctrine and Covenants,

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
which was nearly ready for publication when Joseph

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and Hyrum Smith were murdered.

twelfth chapter of Ether, in the

12
00:00:00,0 --> 01:28:53,
Book of Mormon, and turned down the leaf upon it:

13
01:28:53,0 --> 01:28:53,0
1 To seal the testimony of this book and the

14
01:28:53,0 --> 01:28:53,0
Book of Mormon, we announce the martyrdom of

15
01:28:53,0 --> 01:28:53,0
Joseph Smith the Prophet, and Hyrum Smith the

16
01:28:53,0 --> 01:28:53,0
Patriarch. They were shot in Carthage jail,

17
01:28:53,0 --> 01:28:53,0
on the 27th of June, 1844, about five o’clock

18
01:28:53,0 --> 01:28:53,0
p.m., by an armed mob—painted black—of from

19
01:28:53,0 --> 01:28:53,0
150 to 200 persons. Hyrum was shot first and

20
01:28:53,0 --> 01:28:53,0
fell calmly, exclaiming: I am a dead man!

21
01:28:53,0 --> 01:28:53,0
Joseph leaped from the window, and was shot dead

22
01:28:53,0 --> 01:28:53,0
in the attempt, exclaiming: O Lord my God!

23
01:28:53,0 --> 01:28:53,0
They were both shot after they were dead, in a

24
01:28:53,0 --> 02:03:50,
brutal manner, and both received four balls.

25
02:03:50,0 --> 02:03:50,0
2 John Taylor and Willard Richards, two of

26
02:03:50,0 --> 02:03:50,0
the Twelve, were the only persons in the room

27
02:03:50,0 --> 02:03:50,0
at the time; the former was wounded in a

28
02:03:50,0 --> 02:03:50,0
savage manner with four balls, but has since

29
02:03:50,0 --> 02:03:50,0
recovered; the latter, through the providence of

30
02:03:50,0 --> 02:22:49,
God, escaped, without even a hole in his robe.

31
02:22:49,0 --> 02:22:49,0
3 Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the

32
02:22:49,0 --> 02:22:49,0
Lord, has done more, save Jesus only, for

33
02:22:49,0 --> 02:22:49,0
the salvation of men in this world, than

34
02:22:49,0 --> 02:22:49,0
any other man that ever lived in it. In the

35
02:22:49,0 --> 02:22:49,0
short space of twenty years, he has brought

36
02:22:49,0 --> 02:22:49,0
forth the Book of Mormon, which he

37
02:22:49,0 --> 02:22:49,0
translated by the gift and power of God, and has

38
02:22:49,0 --> 02:22:49,0
been the means of publishing it on two

39
02:22:49,0 --> 02:22:49,0
continents; has sent the fulness of the

40
02:22:49,0 --> 02:22:49,0
everlasting gospel, which it contained, to the four

41
02:22:49,0 --> 02:22:49,0
quarters of the earth; has brought forth

42
02:22:49,0 --> 02:22:49,0
the revelations and commandments which

43
02:22:49,0 --> 02:22:49,0
compose this book of Doctrine and Covenants, and

44
02:22:49,0 --> 02:22:49,0
many other wise documents and instructions

45
02:22:49,0 --> 02:22:49,0
for the benefit of the children of men;

46
02:22:49,0 --> 02:22:49,0
gathered many thousands of the Latter-day

47
02:22:49,0 --> 02:22:49,0
Saints, founded a great city, and left a fame

48
02:22:49,0 --> 02:22:49,0
and name that cannot be slain. He lived

49
02:22:49,0 --> 02:22:49,0
great, and he died great in the eyes of God and

50
02:22:49,0 --> 02:22:49,0
his people; and like most of the Lord’s

51
02:22:49,0 --> 02:22:49,0
anointed in ancient times, has sealed his

52
02:22:49,0 --> 02:22:49,0
mission and his works with his own blood; and

53
02:22:49,0 --> 02:22:49,0
so has his brother Hyrum. In life they were

54
02:22:49,0 --> 03:17:46,
not divided, and in death they were not separated!

55
03:17:46,0 --> 03:17:46,0
4 When Joseph went to Carthage to deliver

56
03:17:46,0 --> 03:17:46,0
himself up to the pretended requirements

57
03:17:46,0 --> 03:17:46,0
of the law, two or three days previous to

58
03:17:46,0 --> 03:17:46,0
his assassination, he said: “I am going

59
03:17:46,0 --> 03:17:46,0
like a lamb to the slaughter; but I am calm

60
03:17:46,0 --> 03:17:46,0
as a summer’s morning; I have a conscience

61
03:17:46,0 --> 03:17:46,0
void of offense towards God, and towards

62
03:17:46,0 --> 03:17:46,0
all men. I shall die innocent, and it shall

63
03:17:46,0 --> 03:17:46,0
yet be said of me—he was murdered in cold

64
03:17:46,0 --> 03:17:46,0
blood.”—The same morning, after Hyrum had

65
03:17:46,0 --> 03:17:46,0
made ready to go—shall it be said to the

66
03:17:46,0 --> 03:17:46,0
slaughter? yes, for so it was—he read the

67
03:17:46,0 --> 04:09:47,
following paragraph, near the close of the 

68
04:09:47,0 --> 04:09:47,0
5 And it came to pass that I prayed unto

69
04:09:47,0 --> 04:09:47,0
the Lord that he would give unto the

70
04:09:47,0 --> 04:09:47,0
Gentiles grace, that they might have

71
04:09:47,0 --> 04:09:47,0
charity. And it came to pass that the Lord

72
04:09:47,0 --> 04:09:47,0
said unto me: If they have not charity it

73
04:09:47,0 --> 04:09:47,0
mattereth not unto thee, thou hast been

74
04:09:47,0 --> 04:09:47,0
faithful; wherefore thy garments shall

75
04:09:47,0 --> 04:09:47,0
be made clean. And because thou hast seen

76
04:09:47,0 --> 04:09:47,0
thy weakness, thou shalt be made

77
04:09:47,0 --> 04:09:47,0
strong, even unto the sitting down in the

78
04:09:47,0 --> 04:09:47,0
place which I have prepared in the mansions

79
04:09:47,0 --> 04:09:47,0
of my Father. And now I … bid farewell

80
04:09:47,0 --> 04:09:47,0
unto the Gentiles; yea, and also unto my

81
04:09:47,0 --> 04:09:47,0
brethren whom I love, until we shall

82
04:09:47,0 --> 04:09:47,0
meet before the judgment-seat of Christ,

83
04:09:47,0 --> 04:09:47,0
where all men shall know that my garments

84
04:09:47,0 --> 04:09:47,0
are not spotted with your blood. The

85
04:09:47,0 --> 04:20:47,
testators are now dead, and their testament is in force.

86
04:20:47,0 --> 04:20:47,0
6 Hyrum Smith was forty-four years old

87
04:20:47,0 --> 04:20:47,0
in February, 1844, and Joseph Smith

88
04:20:47,0 --> 04:20:47,0
was thirty-eight in December, 1843; and

89
04:20:47,0 --> 04:20:47,0
henceforward their names will be

90
04:20:47,0 --> 04:20:47,0
classed among the martyrs of religion; and

91
04:20:47,0 --> 04:20:47,0
the reader in every nation will be

92
04:20:47,0 --> 04:20:47,0
reminded that the Book of Mormon, and

93
04:20:47,0 --> 04:20:47,0
this book of Doctrine and Covenants of

94
04:20:47,0 --> 04:20:47,0
the church, cost the best blood of the

95
04:20:47,0 --> 04:20:47,0
nineteenth century to bring them forth

96
04:20:47,0 --> 04:20:47,0
for the salvation of a ruined world;

97
04:20:47,0 --> 04:20:47,0
and that if the fire can scathe a

98
04:20:47,0 --> 04:20:47,0
green tree for the glory of God, how easy

99
04:20:47,0 --> 04:20:47,0
it will burn up the dry trees to

100
04:20:47,0 --> 04:20:47,0
purify the vineyard of corruption. They

101
04:20:47,0 --> 04:20:47,0
lived for glory; they died for glory; and

102
04:20:47,0 --> 04:20:47,0
glory is their eternal reward. From

103
04:20:47,0 --> 04:20:47,0
age to age shall their names go down to

104
04:20:47,0 --> 04:39:46,
posterity as gems for the sanctified.

105
04:39:46,0 --> 04:39:46,0
7 They were innocent of any crime, as

106
04:39:46,0 --> 04:39:46,0
they had often been proved before,

107
04:39:46,0 --> 04:39:46,0
and were only confined in jail by the

108
04:39:46,0 --> 04:39:46,0
conspiracy of traitors and wicked

109
04:39:46,0 --> 04:39:46,0
men; and their innocent blood on the

110
04:39:46,0 --> 04:39:46,0
floor of Carthage jail is a broad seal

111
04:39:46,0 --> 04:39:46,0
affixed to “Mormonism” that cannot be

112
04:39:46,0 --> 04:39:46,0
rejected by any court on earth, and

113
04:39:46,0 --> 04:39:46,0
their innocent blood on the escutcheon

114
04:39:46,0 --> 04:39:46,0
of the State of Illinois, with the

115
04:39:46,0 --> 04:39:46,0
broken faith of the State as pledged

116
04:39:46,0 --> 04:39:46,0
by the governor, is a witness to the

117
04:39:46,0 --> 04:39:46,0
truth of the everlasting gospel that

118
04:39:46,0 --> 04:39:46,0
all the world cannot impeach; and

119
04:39:46,0 --> 04:39:46,0
their innocent blood on the banner of

120
04:39:46,0 --> 04:39:46,0
liberty, and on the magna charta of the

121
04:39:46,0 --> 04:39:46,0
United States, is an ambassador for

122
04:39:46,0 --> 04:39:46,0
the religion of Jesus Christ, that

123
04:39:46,0 --> 04:39:46,0
will touch the hearts of honest men

124
04:39:46,0 --> 04:39:46,0
among all nations; and their innocent

125
04:39:46,0 --> 04:39:46,0
blood, with the innocent blood of all

126
04:39:46,0 --> 04:39:46,0
the martyrs under the altar that John

127
04:39:46,0 --> 04:39:46,0
saw, will cry unto the Lord of Hosts

128
04:39:46,0 --> 06:18:35,
till he avenges that blood on the earth. Amen.
