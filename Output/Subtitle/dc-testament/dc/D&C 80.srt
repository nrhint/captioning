Stephen Burnett and Eden Smith are called

1 Verily, thus saith the Lord unto

7
00:46:58,0 --> 00:46:58,0
you my servant Stephen Burnett: Go

8
00:46:58,0 --> 00:46:58,0
ye, go ye into the world and preach

9
00:46:58,0 --> 00:46:58,0
the gospel to every creature that

10
00:46:58,0 --> 00:59:34,
cometh under the sound of your voice.

11
00:59:34,0 --> 00:59:34,0
2 And inasmuch as you desire

12
00:59:34,0 --> 00:59:34,0
a companion, I will give

13
00:59:34,0 --> 01:08:37,
unto you my servant Eden Smith.

14
01:08:37,0 --> 01:08:37,0
3 Wherefore, go ye and

15
01:08:37,0 --> 01:08:37,0
preach my gospel, whether

16
01:08:37,0 --> 01:08:37,0
to the north or to the

17
01:08:37,0 --> 01:08:37,0

18
01:08:37,0 --> 01:08:37,0
the west, it mattereth

19
01:08:37,0 --> 01:20:15,
not, for ye cannot go amiss.

20
01:20:15,0 --> 01:20:15,0
4 Therefore, declare

21
01:20:15,0 --> 01:20:15,0
the things which ye have

22
01:20:15,0 --> 01:20:15,0
heard, and verily

23
01:20:15,0 --> 01:33:19,
believe, and know to be true.

24
01:33:19,0 --> 01:33:19,0
5 Behold, this is

25
01:33:19,0 --> 01:33:19,0
the will of him who

26
01:33:19,0 --> 01:33:19,0
hath called you,

27
01:33:19,0 --> 01:33:19,0
your Redeemer, even

28
01:33:19,0 --> 01:42:22,
Jesus Christ. Amen.
