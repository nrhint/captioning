00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:17,278
Section 32 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:23,278
 the Prophet to Parley P. Pratt and Ziba Peterson,

3
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:29,278
 in Manchester, New York, early October 1830. Great

4
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:35,278
 interest and desires were felt by the elders

5
00:00:35,278 --> 00:00:41,278
 respecting the Lamanites, of whose predicted blessings

6
00:00:41,278 --> 00:00:47,278
 the Church had learned from the Book of Mormon. In

7
00:00:47,278 --> 00:00:53,278
 consequence, supplication was made that the Lord

8
00:00:53,278 --> 00:00:59,278
 would indicate His will as to whether elders

9
00:00:59,278 --> 00:01:05,278
 should be sent at that time to the Indian tribes in the

10
00:01:05,278 --> 00:01:11,278
 West. The revelation followed. 
1–3, Parley P.

11
00:01:11,278 --> 00:01:17,278
 Pratt and Ziba Peterson are called to preach to the

12
00:01:17,278 --> 00:01:23,278
 Lamanites and to accompany Oliver Cowdery and

13
00:01:23,278 --> 00:01:29,278
 Peter Whitmer Jr.; 
4–5, They are to pray for an

14
00:01:29,278 --> 00:01:35,278
 understanding of the scriptures.

15
00:01:35,412 --> 00:01:42,162
1 And now concerning my servant Parley P. Pratt,

16
00:01:42,162 --> 00:01:48,912
 behold, I say unto him that as I live I will that

17
00:01:48,912 --> 00:01:55,662
 he shall declare my gospel and learn of me, and be

18
00:01:55,662 --> 00:02:02,412
 meek and lowly of heart

19
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:06,455
2 And that which I have appointed unto him is that

20
00:02:06,455 --> 00:02:10,705
 he shall go with my servants, Oliver Cowdery and

21
00:02:10,705 --> 00:02:14,955
 Peter Whitmer, Jun., into the wilderness among the

22
00:02:14,955 --> 00:02:19,205
 Lamanites

23
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:25,222
3 And Ziba Peterson also shall go with them; and I

24
00:02:25,222 --> 00:02:31,222
 myself will go with them and be in their midst;

25
00:02:31,222 --> 00:02:37,222
 and I am their advocate with the Father, and

26
00:02:37,222 --> 00:02:43,222
 nothing shall prevail against them

27
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:49,247
4 And they shall give heed to that which is

28
00:02:49,247 --> 00:02:54,747
 written, and pretend to no other revelation; and they

29
00:02:54,747 --> 00:03:00,247
 shall pray always that I may unfold the same to

30
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:05,747
 their understanding

31
00:03:05,502 --> 00:03:12,002
5 And they shall give heed unto these words and

32
00:03:12,002 --> 00:03:18,502
 trifle not, and I will bless them. Amen.
