00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 32 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Prophet to Parley P. Pratt and Ziba

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Peterson, in Manchester, New York, early October 1830.

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Great interest and desires were felt by the

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
elders respecting the Lamanites, of whose predicted

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
blessings the Church had learned from the Book

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of Mormon. In consequence, supplication was made

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
that the Lord would indicate His will as to

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
whether elders should be sent at that time to the

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Indian tribes in the West. The revelation

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
followed. 
1–3, Parley P. Pratt and Ziba Peterson are

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
called to preach to the Lamanites and to accompany

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Oliver Cowdery and Peter Whitmer Jr.; 
4–5,

14
00:00:00,0 --> 01:34:52,
They are to pray for an understanding of the scriptures. 

15
01:34:52,0 --> 01:34:52,0
1 And now concerning my servant Parley P.

16
01:34:52,0 --> 01:34:52,0
Pratt, behold, I say unto him that as I live

17
01:34:52,0 --> 01:34:52,0
I will that he shall declare my gospel and

18
01:34:52,0 --> 01:46:29,
learn of me, and be meek and lowly of heart.

19
01:46:29,0 --> 01:46:29,0
2 And that which I have appointed unto

20
01:46:29,0 --> 01:46:29,0
him is that he shall go with my servants,

21
01:46:29,0 --> 01:46:29,0
Oliver Cowdery and Peter Whitmer, Jun.,

22
01:46:29,0 --> 02:00:33,
into the wilderness among the Lamanites.

23
02:00:33,0 --> 02:00:33,0
3 And Ziba Peterson also shall go

24
02:00:33,0 --> 02:00:33,0
with them; and I myself will go with

25
02:00:33,0 --> 02:00:33,0
them and be in their midst; and I

26
02:00:33,0 --> 02:00:33,0
am their advocate with the Father,

27
02:00:33,0 --> 02:17:35,
and nothing shall prevail against them.

28
02:17:35,0 --> 02:17:35,0
4 And they shall give heed to

29
02:17:35,0 --> 02:17:35,0
that which is written, and pretend

30
02:17:35,0 --> 02:17:35,0
to no other revelation; and they

31
02:17:35,0 --> 02:17:35,0
shall pray always that I may

32
02:17:35,0 --> 02:42:36,
unfold the same to their understanding.

33
02:42:36,0 --> 02:42:36,0
5 And they shall give heed

34
02:42:36,0 --> 02:42:36,0
unto these words and trifle

35
02:42:36,0 --> 03:01:35,
not, and I will bless them. Amen.
