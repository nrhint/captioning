00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:06,714
Section 32 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:06,714 --> 00:00:13,428
the Prophet to Parley P. Pratt and Ziba

3
00:00:13,428 --> 00:00:20,142
Peterson, in Manchester, New York, early October 1830.

4
00:00:20,142 --> 00:00:26,856
Great interest and desires were felt by the

5
00:00:26,856 --> 00:00:33,57
elders respecting the Lamanites, of whose predicted

6
00:00:33,57 --> 00:00:40,284
blessings the Church had learned from the Book

7
00:00:40,284 --> 00:00:46,998
of Mormon. In consequence, supplication was made

8
00:00:46,998 --> 00:00:53,712
that the Lord would indicate His will as to

9
00:00:53,712 --> 00:01:00,426
whether elders should be sent at that time to the

10
00:01:00,426 --> 00:01:07,14
Indian tribes in the West. The revelation

11
00:01:07,14 --> 00:01:13,854
followed. 
1–3, Parley P. Pratt and Ziba Peterson are

12
00:01:13,854 --> 00:01:20,568
called to preach to the Lamanites and to accompany

13
00:01:20,568 --> 00:01:27,282
Oliver Cowdery and Peter Whitmer Jr.; 
4–5,

14
00:01:27,282 --> 00:01:34,962
They are to pray for an understanding of the scriptures. 

15
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:41,712
1 And now concerning my servant Parley P.

16
00:01:41,712 --> 00:01:48,462
Pratt, behold, I say unto him that as I live

17
00:01:48,462 --> 00:01:55,212
I will that he shall declare my gospel and

18
00:01:55,212 --> 00:02:01,505
learn of me, and be meek and lowly of heart.

19
00:02:01,505 --> 00:02:05,755
2 And that which I have appointed unto

20
00:02:05,755 --> 00:02:10,005
him is that he shall go with my servants,

21
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:14,255
Oliver Cowdery and Peter Whitmer, Jun.,

22
00:02:14,255 --> 00:02:18,555
into the wilderness among the Lamanites.

23
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,755
3 And Ziba Peterson also shall go

24
00:02:20,755 --> 00:02:22,955
with them; and I myself will go with

25
00:02:22,955 --> 00:02:25,155
them and be in their midst; and I

26
00:02:25,155 --> 00:02:27,355
am their advocate with the Father,

27
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,566
and nothing shall prevail against them.

28
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,166
4 And they shall give heed to

29
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:34,766
that which is written, and pretend

30
00:02:34,766 --> 00:02:37,366
to no other revelation; and they

31
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,966
shall pray always that I may

32
00:02:39,966 --> 00:02:42,646
unfold the same to their understanding.

33
00:02:42,646 --> 00:02:49,979
5 And they shall give heed

34
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:57,312
unto these words and trifle

35
00:02:57,312 --> 00:03:04,718
not, and I will bless them. Amen.
