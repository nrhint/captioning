1
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:19,011
Section 61 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:19,011 --> 00:00:26,744
 the Prophet, on the bank of the Missouri River,

3
00:00:26,744 --> 00:00:34,477
 McIlwaine’s Bend, August 12, 1831. On their return

4
00:00:34,477 --> 00:00:42,21
 trip to Kirtland, the Prophet and ten elders had

5
00:00:42,21 --> 00:00:49,943
 traveled down the Missouri River in canoes. On the

6
00:00:49,943 --> 00:00:57,676
 third day of the journey, many dangers were

7
00:00:57,676 --> 00:01:05,409
 experienced. Elder William W. Phelps, in a daylight

8
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:13,142
 vision, saw the destroyer riding in power upon the face

9
00:01:13,142 --> 00:01:20,875
 of the waters. 
1–12, The Lord has decreed many

10
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:28,608
 destructions upon the waters; 
13–22, The waters

11
00:01:28,608 --> 00:01:36,341
 were cursed by John, and the destroyer rides upon

12
00:01:36,341 --> 00:01:44,074
 their face; 
23–29, Some have power to command the

13
00:01:44,074 --> 00:01:51,807
 waters; 
30–35, Elders are to journey two by two and

14
00:01:51,807 --> 00:01:59,54
 preach the gospel; 
36–39, They are to prepare

15
00:01:59,54 --> 00:02:07,273
 for the coming of the Son of Man.

16
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:13,361
1 Behold, and hearken unto the voice of him who

17
00:02:13,361 --> 00:02:18,861
 has all power, who is from everlasting to

18
00:02:18,861 --> 00:02:24,361
 everlasting, even Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the

19
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:29,861
 end

20
00:02:29,132 --> 00:02:34,932
2 Behold, verily thus saith the Lord unto you, O

21
00:02:34,932 --> 00:02:40,732
 ye elders of my church, who are assembled upon this

22
00:02:40,732 --> 00:02:46,532
 spot, whose sins are now forgiven you, for I, the

23
00:02:46,532 --> 00:02:52,332
 Lord, forgive sins, and am merciful unto those

24
00:02:52,332 --> 00:02:58,132
 who confess their sins with humble hearts

25
00:02:58,695 --> 00:03:04,195
3 But verily I say unto you, that it is not

26
00:03:04,195 --> 00:03:09,695
 needful for this whole company of mine elders to be

27
00:03:09,695 --> 00:03:15,195
 moving swiftly upon the waters, whilst the inhabitants

28
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:20,695
 on either side are perishing in unbelief

29
00:03:20,984 --> 00:03:27,984
4 Nevertheless, I suffered it that ye might bear

30
00:03:27,984 --> 00:03:34,984
 record; behold, there are many dangers upon the

31
00:03:34,984 --> 00:03:41,984
 waters, and more especially hereafter

32
00:03:41,505 --> 00:03:47,172
5 For I, the Lord, have decreed in mine anger many

33
00:03:47,172 --> 00:03:52,839
 destructions upon the waters; yea, and especially

34
00:03:52,839 --> 00:03:58,506
 upon these waters

35
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:04,705
6 Nevertheless, all flesh is in mine hand, and he

36
00:04:04,705 --> 00:04:11,372
 that is faithful among you shall not perish by the

37
00:04:11,372 --> 00:04:18,039
 waters

38
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:24,357
7 Wherefore, it is expedient that my servant

39
00:04:24,357 --> 00:04:30,69
 Sidney Gilbert and my servant William W. Phelps be in

40
00:04:30,69 --> 00:04:37,023
 haste upon their errand and mission

41
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:42,277
8 Nevertheless, I would not suffer that ye should

42
00:04:42,277 --> 00:04:47,527
 part until you were chastened for all your sins,

43
00:04:47,527 --> 00:04:52,777
 that you might be one, that you might not perish in

44
00:04:52,777 --> 00:04:58,027
 wickedness

45
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:05,048
9 But now, verily I say, it behooveth me that ye

46
00:05:05,048 --> 00:05:11,548
 should part. Wherefore let my servants Sidney

47
00:05:11,548 --> 00:05:18,048
 Gilbert and William W. Phelps take their former

48
00:05:18,048 --> 00:05:24,548
 company, and let them take their journey in haste that

49
00:05:24,548 --> 00:05:31,048
 they may fill their mission, and through faith they

50
00:05:31,048 --> 00:05:37,548
 shall overcome

51
00:05:37,287 --> 00:05:42,287
10 And inasmuch as they are faithful they shall be

52
00:05:42,287 --> 00:05:47,287
 preserved, and I, the Lord, will be with them

53
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:52,314
11 And let the residue take that which is needful

54
00:05:52,314 --> 00:05:56,814
 for clothing

55
00:05:56,84 --> 00:06:03,84
12 Let my servant Sidney Gilbert take that which

56
00:06:03,84 --> 00:06:10,84
 is not needful with him, as you shall agree

57
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:15,837
13 And now, behold, for your good I gave unto you

58
00:06:15,837 --> 00:06:20,837
 a commandment concerning these things; and I, the

59
00:06:20,837 --> 00:06:25,837
 Lord, will reason with you as with men in days of

60
00:06:25,837 --> 00:06:30,837
 old

61
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:38,491
14 Behold, I, the Lord, in the beginning blessed

62
00:06:38,491 --> 00:06:46,158
 the waters; but in the last days, by the mouth of

63
00:06:46,158 --> 00:06:53,825
 my servant John, I cursed the waters

64
00:06:53,813 --> 00:07:00,313
15 Wherefore, the days will come that no flesh

65
00:07:00,313 --> 00:07:06,813
 shall be safe upon the waters

66
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:14,927
16 And it shall be said in days to come that none

67
00:07:14,927 --> 00:07:22,927
 is able to go up to the land of Zion upon the

68
00:07:22,927 --> 00:07:30,927
 waters, but he that is upright in heart

69
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:38,417
17 And, as I, the Lord, in the beginning cursed

70
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:46,167
 the land, even so in the last days have I blessed

71
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:53,917
 it, in its time, for the use of my saints, that they

72
00:07:53,917 --> 00:08:01,667
 may partake the fatness thereof

73
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:08,648
18 And now I give unto you a commandment that what

74
00:08:08,648 --> 00:08:15,648
 I say unto one I say unto all, that you shall

75
00:08:15,648 --> 00:08:22,648
 forewarn your brethren concerning these waters, that

76
00:08:22,648 --> 00:08:29,648
 they come not in journeying upon them, lest their

77
00:08:29,648 --> 00:08:36,648
 faith fail and they are caught in snares

78
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:40,816
19 I, the Lord, have decreed, and the destroyer

79
00:08:40,816 --> 00:08:45,483
 rideth upon the face thereof, and I revoke not the

80
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:50,15
 decree

81
00:08:50,146 --> 00:08:54,146
20 I, the Lord, was angry with you yesterday, but

82
00:08:54,146 --> 00:08:58,146
 today mine anger is turned away

83
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:03,688
21 Wherefore, let those concerning whom I have

84
00:09:03,688 --> 00:09:08,438
 spoken, that should take their journey in haste—again

85
00:09:08,438 --> 00:09:13,188
 I say unto you, let them take their journey in

86
00:09:13,188 --> 00:09:17,938
 haste

87
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:22,857
22 And it mattereth not unto me, after a little,

88
00:09:22,857 --> 00:09:28,257
 if it so be that they fill their mission, whether

89
00:09:28,257 --> 00:09:33,657
 they go by water or by land; let this be as it is

90
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:39,057
 made known unto them according to their judgments

91
00:09:39,057 --> 00:09:44,457
 hereafter

92
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:51,217
23 And now, concerning my servants, Sidney Rigdon,

93
00:09:51,217 --> 00:09:57,717
 Joseph Smith, Jun., and Oliver Cowdery, let them

94
00:09:57,717 --> 00:10:04,217
 come not again upon the waters, save it be upon

95
00:10:04,217 --> 00:10:10,717
 the canal, while journeying unto their homes; or in

96
00:10:10,717 --> 00:10:17,217
 other words they shall not come upon the waters to

97
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:23,717
 journey, save upon the canal

98
00:10:23,69 --> 00:10:29,29
24 Behold, I, the Lord, have appointed a way for

99
00:10:29,29 --> 00:10:34,89
 the journeying of my saints; and behold, this is

100
00:10:34,89 --> 00:10:40,49
 the way—that after they leave the canal they shall

101
00:10:40,49 --> 00:10:46,09
 journey by land, inasmuch as they are commanded to

102
00:10:46,09 --> 00:10:51,69
 journey and go up unto the land of Zion

103
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:56,684
25 And they shall do like unto the children of

104
00:10:56,684 --> 00:11:02,184
 Israel, pitching their tents by the way

105
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:06,962
26 And, behold, this commandment you shall give

106
00:11:06,962 --> 00:11:10,962
 unto all your brethren

107
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:16,236
27 Nevertheless, unto whom is given power to

108
00:11:16,236 --> 00:11:22,236
 command the waters, unto him it is given by the Spirit

109
00:11:22,236 --> 00:11:28,236
 to know all his ways

110
00:11:28,004 --> 00:11:33,504
28 Wherefore, let him do as the Spirit of the

111
00:11:33,504 --> 00:11:39,004
 living God commandeth him, whether upon the land or

112
00:11:39,004 --> 00:11:44,504
 upon the waters, as it remaineth with me to do

113
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:50,004
 hereafter

114
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:56,609
29 And unto you is given the course for the

115
00:11:56,609 --> 00:12:02,942
 saints, or the way for the saints of the camp of the

116
00:12:02,942 --> 00:12:09,275
 Lord, to journey

117
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:15,979
30 And again, verily I say unto you, my servants,

118
00:12:15,979 --> 00:12:22,179
 Sidney Rigdon, Joseph Smith, Jun., and Oliver

119
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:28,379
 Cowdery, shall not open their mouths in the

120
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:34,579
 congregations of the wicked until they arrive at Cincinnati

121
00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:40,779


122
00:12:40,043 --> 00:12:46,043
31 And in that place they shall lift up their

123
00:12:46,043 --> 00:12:52,043
 voices unto God against that people, yea, unto him

124
00:12:52,043 --> 00:12:58,043
 whose anger is kindled against their wickedness, a

125
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:04,043
 people who are well-nigh ripened for destruction

126
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:11,267
32 And from thence let them journey for the

127
00:13:11,267 --> 00:13:18,517
 congregations of their brethren, for their labors even

128
00:13:18,517 --> 00:13:25,767
 now are wanted more abundantly among them than

129
00:13:25,767 --> 00:13:33,017
 among the congregations of the wicked

130
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:40,513
33 And now, concerning the residue, let them

131
00:13:40,513 --> 00:13:47,513
 journey and declare the word among the congregations of

132
00:13:47,513 --> 00:13:54,513
 the wicked, inasmuch as it is given

133
00:13:54,517 --> 00:14:00,517
34 And inasmuch as they do this they shall rid

134
00:14:00,517 --> 00:14:06,517
 their garments, and they shall be spotless before me

135
00:14:06,517 --> 00:14:12,517


136
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:19,618
35 And let them journey together, or two by two,

137
00:14:19,618 --> 00:14:26,951
 as seemeth them good, only let my servant Reynolds

138
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:34,284
 Cahoon, and my servant Samuel H. Smith, with whom

139
00:14:34,284 --> 00:14:41,617
 I am well pleased, be not separated until they

140
00:14:41,617 --> 00:14:48,95
 return to their homes, and this for a wise purpose in

141
00:14:48,95 --> 00:14:56,283
 me

142
00:14:56,245 --> 00:15:02,745
36 And now, verily I say unto you, and what I say

143
00:15:02,745 --> 00:15:09,245
 unto one I say unto all, be of good cheer, little

144
00:15:09,245 --> 00:15:15,745
 children; for I am in your midst, and I have not

145
00:15:15,745 --> 00:15:22,245
 forsaken you

146
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:27,004
37 And inasmuch as you have humbled yourselves

147
00:15:27,004 --> 00:15:32,004
 before me, the blessings of the kingdom are yours

148
00:15:32,081 --> 00:15:38,748
38 Gird up your loins and be watchful and be

149
00:15:38,748 --> 00:15:45,415
 sober, looking forth for the coming of the Son of Man,

150
00:15:45,415 --> 00:15:52,082
 for he cometh in an hour you think not

151
00:15:52,368 --> 00:16:02,701
39 Pray always that you enter not into temptation,

152
00:16:02,701 --> 00:16:13,034
 that you may abide the day of his coming, whether

153
00:16:13,034 --> 00:16:23,367
 in life or in death. Even so. Amen.
