00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 61 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Prophet, on the bank of the Missouri River,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
McIlwaine’s Bend, August 12, 1831. On their

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
return trip to Kirtland, the Prophet and ten elders

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
had traveled down the Missouri River in canoes.

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
On the third day of the journey, many dangers

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
were experienced. Elder William W. Phelps, in a

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
daylight vision, saw the destroyer riding in

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
power upon the face of the waters. 
1–12, The Lord

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
has decreed many destructions upon the waters;

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
13–22, The waters were cursed by John, and the

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
destroyer rides upon their face; 
23–29, Some have

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
power to command the waters; 
30–35, Elders are

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
to journey two by two and preach the gospel;

15
00:00:00,0 --> 02:06:48,
36–39, They are to prepare for the coming of the Son of Man. 

16
02:06:48,0 --> 02:06:48,0
1 Behold, and hearken unto the voice

17
02:06:48,0 --> 02:06:48,0
of him who has all power, who is from

18
02:06:48,0 --> 02:06:48,0
everlasting to everlasting, even

19
02:06:48,0 --> 02:17:48,
Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end.

20
02:17:48,0 --> 02:17:48,0
2 Behold, verily thus saith the

21
02:17:48,0 --> 02:17:48,0
Lord unto you, O ye elders of my

22
02:17:48,0 --> 02:17:48,0
church, who are assembled upon this

23
02:17:48,0 --> 02:17:48,0
spot, whose sins are now forgiven

24
02:17:48,0 --> 02:17:48,0
you, for I, the Lord, forgive sins,

25
02:17:48,0 --> 02:17:48,0
and am merciful unto those who

26
02:17:48,0 --> 02:18:52,
confess their sins with humble hearts;

27
02:18:52,0 --> 02:18:52,0
3 But verily I say unto you,

28
02:18:52,0 --> 02:18:52,0
that it is not needful for this

29
02:18:52,0 --> 02:18:52,0
whole company of mine elders to be

30
02:18:52,0 --> 02:18:52,0
moving swiftly upon the waters,

31
02:18:52,0 --> 02:18:52,0
whilst the inhabitants on either

32
02:18:52,0 --> 02:27:55,
side are perishing in unbelief.

33
02:27:55,0 --> 02:27:55,0
4 Nevertheless, I suffered

34
02:27:55,0 --> 02:27:55,0
it that ye might bear

35
02:27:55,0 --> 02:27:55,0
record; behold, there are many

36
02:27:55,0 --> 02:27:55,0
dangers upon the waters, and

37
02:27:55,0 --> 02:30:57,
more especially hereafter;

38
02:30:57,0 --> 02:30:57,0
5 For I, the Lord, have

39
02:30:57,0 --> 02:30:57,0
decreed in mine anger

40
02:30:57,0 --> 02:30:57,0
many destructions upon

41
02:30:57,0 --> 02:30:57,0
the waters; yea, and

42
02:30:57,0 --> 02:45:59,
especially upon these waters.

43
02:45:59,0 --> 02:45:59,0
6 Nevertheless, all

44
02:45:59,0 --> 02:45:59,0
flesh is in mine hand,

45
02:45:59,0 --> 02:45:59,0
and he that is

46
02:45:59,0 --> 02:45:59,0
faithful among you shall

47
02:45:59,0 --> 02:53:02,
not perish by the waters.

48
02:53:02,0 --> 02:53:02,0
7 Wherefore, it is

49
02:53:02,0 --> 02:53:02,0
expedient that my

50
02:53:02,0 --> 02:53:02,0
servant Sidney

51
02:53:02,0 --> 02:53:02,0
Gilbert and my servant

52
02:53:02,0 --> 02:53:02,0
William W. Phelps be

53
02:53:02,0 --> 02:53:02,0
in haste upon

54
02:53:02,0 --> 02:54:06,
their errand and mission.

55
02:54:06,0 --> 02:54:06,0
8 Nevertheless, I

56
02:54:06,0 --> 02:54:06,0
would not suffer

57
02:54:06,0 --> 02:54:06,0
that ye should part

58
02:54:06,0 --> 02:54:06,0
until you were

59
02:54:06,0 --> 02:54:06,0
chastened for all

60
02:54:06,0 --> 02:54:06,0
your sins, that you

61
02:54:06,0 --> 02:54:06,0
might be one, that

62
02:54:06,0 --> 02:54:06,0
you might not

63
02:54:06,0 --> 02:58:13,
perish in wickedness;

64
02:58:13,0 --> 02:58:13,0
9 But now, verily

65
02:58:13,0 --> 02:58:13,0
I say, it

66
02:58:13,0 --> 02:58:13,0
behooveth me that ye

67
02:58:13,0 --> 02:58:13,0
should part.

68
02:58:13,0 --> 02:58:13,0
Wherefore let my

69
02:58:13,0 --> 02:58:13,0
servants Sidney Gilbert

70
02:58:13,0 --> 02:58:13,0
and William W.

71
02:58:13,0 --> 02:58:13,0
Phelps take their

72
02:58:13,0 --> 02:58:13,0
former company,

73
02:58:13,0 --> 02:58:13,0
and let them take

74
02:58:13,0 --> 02:58:13,0
their journey in

75
02:58:13,0 --> 02:58:13,0
haste that they

76
02:58:13,0 --> 02:58:13,0
may fill their

77
02:58:13,0 --> 02:58:13,0
mission, and through

78
02:58:13,0 --> 02:59:17,
faith they shall overcome;

79
02:59:17,0 --> 02:59:17,0
10 And inasmuch

80
02:59:17,0 --> 02:59:17,0
as they are

81
02:59:17,0 --> 02:59:17,0
faithful they shall

82
02:59:17,0 --> 02:59:17,0
be preserved,

83
02:59:17,0 --> 02:59:17,0
and I, the Lord,

84
02:59:17,0 --> 03:14:19,
will be with them.

85
03:14:19,0 --> 03:14:19,0
11 And let the

86
03:14:19,0 --> 03:14:19,0
residue take

87
03:14:19,0 --> 03:14:19,0
that which is

88
03:14:19,0 --> 03:15:23,
needful for clothing.

89
03:15:23,0 --> 03:15:23,0
12 Let my

90
03:15:23,0 --> 03:15:23,0
servant Sidney

91
03:15:23,0 --> 03:15:23,0
Gilbert take

92
03:15:23,0 --> 03:15:23,0
that which is

93
03:15:23,0 --> 03:15:23,0
not needful

94
03:15:23,0 --> 03:15:23,0
with him, as

95
03:15:23,0 --> 03:19:30,
you shall agree.

96
03:19:30,0 --> 03:19:30,0
13 And now,

97
03:19:30,0 --> 03:19:30,0
behold, for

98
03:19:30,0 --> 03:19:30,0
your good I

99
03:19:30,0 --> 03:19:30,0
gave unto

100
03:19:30,0 --> 03:19:30,0
you a

101
03:19:30,0 --> 03:19:30,0
commandment

102
03:19:30,0 --> 03:19:30,0
concerning these

103
03:19:30,0 --> 03:19:30,0
things; and I,

104
03:19:30,0 --> 03:19:30,0
the Lord,

105
03:19:30,0 --> 03:19:30,0
will reason

106
03:19:30,0 --> 03:19:30,0
with you as

107
03:19:30,0 --> 03:34:32,
with men in days of old.

108
03:34:32,0 --> 03:34:32,0
14 Behold,

109
03:34:32,0 --> 03:34:32,0
I, the

110
03:34:32,0 --> 03:34:32,0
Lord, in the

111
03:34:32,0 --> 03:34:32,0
beginning

112
03:34:32,0 --> 03:34:32,0
blessed the

113
03:34:32,0 --> 03:34:32,0
waters; but

114
03:34:32,0 --> 03:34:32,0
in the last

115
03:34:32,0 --> 03:34:32,0
days, by

116
03:34:32,0 --> 03:34:32,0
the mouth of

117
03:34:32,0 --> 03:34:32,0
my servant

118
03:34:32,0 --> 03:34:32,0
John, I

119
03:34:32,0 --> 03:40:37,
cursed the waters.

120
03:40:37,0 --> 03:40:37,0
15

121
03:40:37,0 --> 03:40:37,0
Wherefore, the days

122
03:40:37,0 --> 03:40:37,0
will come

123
03:40:37,0 --> 03:40:37,0
that no

124
03:40:37,0 --> 03:40:37,0
flesh shall be

125
03:40:37,0 --> 03:40:37,0
safe upon

126
03:40:37,0 --> 03:52:15,
the waters.

127
03:52:15,0 --> 03:52:15,0
16 And it

128
03:52:15,0 --> 03:52:15,0
shall be

129
03:52:15,0 --> 03:52:15,0
said in

130
03:52:15,0 --> 03:52:15,0
days to come

131
03:52:15,0 --> 03:52:15,0
that none

132
03:52:15,0 --> 03:52:15,0
is able to

133
03:52:15,0 --> 03:52:15,0
go up to

134
03:52:15,0 --> 03:52:15,0
the land

135
03:52:15,0 --> 03:52:15,0
of Zion

136
03:52:15,0 --> 03:52:15,0
upon the

137
03:52:15,0 --> 03:52:15,0
waters, but he

138
03:52:15,0 --> 03:52:15,0
that is

139
03:52:15,0 --> 03:54:19,
upright in heart.

140
03:54:19,0 --> 03:54:19,0
17 And,

141
03:54:19,0 --> 03:54:19,0
as I, the

142
03:54:19,0 --> 03:54:19,0
Lord, in

143
03:54:19,0 --> 03:54:19,0
the

144
03:54:19,0 --> 03:54:19,0
beginning

145
03:54:19,0 --> 03:54:19,0
cursed the

146
03:54:19,0 --> 03:54:19,0
land, even

147
03:54:19,0 --> 03:54:19,0
so in the

148
03:54:19,0 --> 03:54:19,0
last

149
03:54:19,0 --> 03:54:19,0
days have I

150
03:54:19,0 --> 03:54:19,0
blessed

151
03:54:19,0 --> 03:54:19,0
it, in its

152
03:54:19,0 --> 03:54:19,0
time,

153
03:54:19,0 --> 03:54:19,0
for the use

154
03:54:19,0 --> 03:54:19,0
of my

155
03:54:19,0 --> 03:54:19,0
saints,

156
03:54:19,0 --> 03:54:19,0
that they

157
03:54:19,0 --> 03:54:19,0
may partake

158
03:54:19,0 --> 03:55:23,
the fatness thereof.

159
03:55:23,0 --> 03:55:23,0
18 And

160
03:55:23,0 --> 03:55:23,0
now I

161
03:55:23,0 --> 03:55:23,0
give unto

162
03:55:23,0 --> 03:55:23,0
you a

163
03:55:23,0 --> 03:55:23,0
commandment

164
03:55:23,0 --> 03:55:23,0
that

165
03:55:23,0 --> 03:55:23,0
what I say

166
03:55:23,0 --> 03:55:23,0
unto

167
03:55:23,0 --> 03:55:23,0
one I say

168
03:55:23,0 --> 03:55:23,0
unto

169
03:55:23,0 --> 03:55:23,0
all, that

170
03:55:23,0 --> 03:55:23,0
you shall

171
03:55:23,0 --> 03:55:23,0


172
03:55:23,0 --> 03:55:23,0
forewarn your

173
03:55:23,0 --> 03:55:23,0
brethren

174
03:55:23,0 --> 03:55:23,0


175
03:55:23,0 --> 03:55:23,0
concerning these

176
03:55:23,0 --> 03:55:23,0
waters,

177
03:55:23,0 --> 03:55:23,0
that

178
03:55:23,0 --> 03:55:23,0
they come

179
03:55:23,0 --> 03:55:23,0
not in

180
03:55:23,0 --> 03:55:23,0


181
03:55:23,0 --> 03:55:23,0
journeying upon

182
03:55:23,0 --> 03:55:23,0
them,

183
03:55:23,0 --> 03:55:23,0
lest their

184
03:55:23,0 --> 03:55:23,0
faith

185
03:55:23,0 --> 03:54:27,
fail and they are caught in snares;

186
03:54:27,0 --> 03:54:27,0
19 I,

187
03:54:27,0 --> 03:54:27,0
the

188
03:54:27,0 --> 03:54:27,0
Lord, have

189
03:54:27,0 --> 03:54:27,0


190
03:54:27,0 --> 03:54:27,0
decreed, and

191
03:54:27,0 --> 03:54:27,0
the

192
03:54:27,0 --> 03:54:27,0
destroyer

193
03:54:27,0 --> 03:54:27,0
rideth

194
03:54:27,0 --> 03:54:27,0
upon the

195
03:54:27,0 --> 03:54:27,0
face

196
03:54:27,0 --> 03:54:27,0
thereof,

197
03:54:27,0 --> 03:54:27,0
and I

198
03:54:27,0 --> 03:54:27,0
revoke

199
03:54:27,0 --> 03:50:07,
not the decree.

200
03:50:07,0 --> 03:50:07,0
20 I,

201
03:50:07,0 --> 03:50:07,0
the

202
03:50:07,0 --> 03:50:07,0
Lord,

203
03:50:07,0 --> 03:50:07,0
was

204
03:50:07,0 --> 03:50:07,0
angry with

205
03:50:07,0 --> 03:50:07,0
you

206
03:50:07,0 --> 03:50:07,0


207
03:50:07,0 --> 03:50:07,0
yesterday,

208
03:50:07,0 --> 03:50:07,0
but

209
03:50:07,0 --> 03:50:07,0
today mine

210
03:50:07,0 --> 03:50:07,0
anger

211
03:50:07,0 --> 03:55:12,
is turned away.

212
03:55:12,0 --> 03:55:12,0
21

213
03:55:12,0 --> 03:55:12,0


214
03:55:12,0 --> 03:55:12,0
Wherefore,

215
03:55:12,0 --> 03:55:12,0
let

216
03:55:12,0 --> 03:55:12,0
those

217
03:55:12,0 --> 03:55:12,0


218
03:55:12,0 --> 03:55:12,0
concerning

219
03:55:12,0 --> 03:55:12,0
whom

220
03:55:12,0 --> 03:55:12,0
I

221
03:55:12,0 --> 03:55:12,0
have

222
03:55:12,0 --> 03:55:12,0
spoken,

223
03:55:12,0 --> 03:55:12,0
that

224
03:55:12,0 --> 03:55:12,0


225
03:55:12,0 --> 03:55:12,0
