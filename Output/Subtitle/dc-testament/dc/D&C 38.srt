00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 38 Revelation given through Joseph

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Smith the Prophet, at Fayette, New York, January 2,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
1831. The occasion was a conference of the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Church. 
1–6, Christ created all things; 
7–8, He

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
is in the midst of His Saints, who will soon

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
see Him; 
9–12, All flesh is corrupted before

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Him; 
13–22, He has reserved a land of promise for

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
His Saints in time and in eternity; 
23–27,

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
The Saints are commanded to be one and esteem

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
each other as brethren; 
28–29, Wars are

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
predicted; 
30–33, The Saints are to be given power from

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
on high and to go forth among all nations;

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
34–42, The Church is commanded to care for the

14
00:00:00,0 --> 01:55:53,
poor and needy and to seek the riches of eternity. 

15
01:55:53,0 --> 01:55:53,0
1 Thus saith the Lord your God, even Jesus

16
01:55:53,0 --> 01:55:53,0
Christ, the Great I Am, Alpha and Omega, the

17
01:55:53,0 --> 01:55:53,0
beginning and the end, the same which looked upon

18
01:55:53,0 --> 01:55:53,0
the wide expanse of eternity, and all the

19
01:55:53,0 --> 02:06:54,
seraphic hosts of heaven, before the world was made;

20
02:06:54,0 --> 02:06:54,0
2 The same which knoweth all things, for

21
02:06:54,0 --> 02:18:31,
all things are present before mine eyes;

22
02:18:31,0 --> 02:18:31,0
3 I am the same which spake, and the

23
02:18:31,0 --> 02:31:34,
world was made, and all things came by me.

24
02:31:34,0 --> 02:31:34,0
4 I am the same which have taken the

25
02:31:34,0 --> 02:31:34,0
Zion of Enoch into mine own bosom;

26
02:31:34,0 --> 02:31:34,0
and verily, I say, even as many as have

27
02:31:34,0 --> 02:31:34,0
believed in my name, for I am

28
02:31:34,0 --> 02:31:34,0
Christ, and in mine own name, by the virtue

29
02:31:34,0 --> 02:31:34,0
of the blood which I have spilt,

30
02:31:34,0 --> 02:27:14,
have I pleaded before the Father for them.

31
02:27:14,0 --> 02:27:14,0
5 But behold, the residue of

32
02:27:14,0 --> 02:27:14,0
the wicked have I kept in

33
02:27:14,0 --> 02:27:14,0
chains of darkness until the

34
02:27:14,0 --> 02:27:14,0
judgment of the great day, which

35
02:27:14,0 --> 02:29:18,
shall come at the end of the earth;

36
02:29:18,0 --> 02:29:18,0
6 And even so will I cause

37
02:29:18,0 --> 02:29:18,0
the wicked to be kept,

38
02:29:18,0 --> 02:29:18,0
that will not hear my voice

39
02:29:18,0 --> 02:29:18,0
but harden their hearts,

40
02:29:18,0 --> 02:31:22,
and wo, wo, wo, is their doom.

41
02:31:22,0 --> 02:31:22,0
7 But behold, verily,

42
02:31:22,0 --> 02:31:22,0
verily, I say unto you

43
02:31:22,0 --> 02:31:22,0
that mine eyes are

44
02:31:22,0 --> 02:31:22,0
upon you. I am in your

45
02:31:22,0 --> 02:27:02,
midst and ye cannot see me;

46
02:27:02,0 --> 02:27:02,0
8 But the day soon

47
02:27:02,0 --> 02:27:02,0
cometh that ye shall

48
02:27:02,0 --> 02:27:02,0
see me, and know

49
02:27:02,0 --> 02:27:02,0
that I am; for the veil

50
02:27:02,0 --> 02:27:02,0
of darkness shall

51
02:27:02,0 --> 02:27:02,0
soon be rent, and he

52
02:27:02,0 --> 02:27:02,0
that is not purified

53
02:27:02,0 --> 02:29:36,
shall not abide the day.

54
02:29:36,0 --> 02:29:36,0
9 Wherefore, gird

55
02:29:36,0 --> 02:29:36,0
up your loins and

56
02:29:36,0 --> 02:29:36,0
be prepared.

57
02:29:36,0 --> 02:29:36,0
Behold, the kingdom is

58
02:29:36,0 --> 02:29:36,0
yours, and the

59
02:29:36,0 --> 02:31:40,
enemy shall not overcome.

60
02:31:40,0 --> 02:31:40,0
10 Verily I say

61
02:31:40,0 --> 02:31:40,0
unto you, ye are

62
02:31:40,0 --> 02:31:40,0
clean, but not

63
02:31:40,0 --> 02:31:40,0
all; and there is

64
02:31:40,0 --> 02:31:40,0
none else with whom

65
02:31:40,0 --> 02:33:44,
I am well pleased;

66
02:33:44,0 --> 02:33:44,0
11 For all flesh

67
02:33:44,0 --> 02:33:44,0
is corrupted

68
02:33:44,0 --> 02:33:44,0
before me; and the

69
02:33:44,0 --> 02:33:44,0
powers of

70
02:33:44,0 --> 02:33:44,0
darkness prevail upon

71
02:33:44,0 --> 02:33:44,0
the earth,

72
02:33:44,0 --> 02:33:44,0
among the children

73
02:33:44,0 --> 02:33:44,0
of men, in the

74
02:33:44,0 --> 02:33:44,0
presence of all

75
02:33:44,0 --> 02:41:49,
the hosts of heaven—

76
02:41:49,0 --> 02:41:49,0
12 Which

77
02:41:49,0 --> 02:41:49,0
causeth silence to

78
02:41:49,0 --> 02:41:49,0
reign, and all

79
02:41:49,0 --> 02:41:49,0
eternity is

80
02:41:49,0 --> 02:41:49,0
pained, and the

81
02:41:49,0 --> 02:41:49,0
angels are waiting

82
02:41:49,0 --> 02:41:49,0
the great

83
02:41:49,0 --> 02:41:49,0
command to reap down

84
02:41:49,0 --> 02:41:49,0
the earth, to

85
02:41:49,0 --> 02:41:49,0
gather the

86
02:41:49,0 --> 02:41:49,0
tares that they may

87
02:41:49,0 --> 02:41:49,0
be burned;

88
02:41:49,0 --> 02:41:49,0
and, behold, the

89
02:41:49,0 --> 02:56:51,
enemy is combined.

90
02:56:51,0 --> 02:56:51,0
13 And now I

91
02:56:51,0 --> 02:56:51,0
show unto you a

92
02:56:51,0 --> 02:56:51,0
mystery, a

93
02:56:51,0 --> 02:56:51,0
thing which is

94
02:56:51,0 --> 02:56:51,0
had in secret

95
02:56:51,0 --> 02:56:51,0
chambers, to

96
02:56:51,0 --> 02:56:51,0
bring to pass

97
02:56:51,0 --> 02:56:51,0
even your

98
02:56:51,0 --> 02:56:51,0
destruction in

99
02:56:51,0 --> 02:56:51,0
process of time,

100
02:56:51,0 --> 03:39:48,
and ye knew it not;

101
03:39:48,0 --> 03:39:48,0
14 But now I

102
03:39:48,0 --> 03:39:48,0
tell it unto

103
03:39:48,0 --> 03:39:48,0
you, and ye

104
03:39:48,0 --> 03:39:48,0
are blessed,

105
03:39:48,0 --> 03:39:48,0
not because of

106
03:39:48,0 --> 03:39:48,0
your

107
03:39:48,0 --> 03:39:48,0
iniquity, neither

108
03:39:48,0 --> 03:39:48,0
your hearts of

109
03:39:48,0 --> 03:39:48,0
unbelief; for

110
03:39:48,0 --> 03:39:48,0
verily some

111
03:39:48,0 --> 03:39:48,0
of you are

112
03:39:48,0 --> 03:39:48,0
guilty before

113
03:39:48,0 --> 03:39:48,0
me, but I will

114
03:39:48,0 --> 03:39:48,0
be merciful

115
03:39:48,0 --> 03:58:47,
unto your weakness.

116
03:58:47,0 --> 03:58:47,0
15

117
03:58:47,0 --> 03:58:47,0
Therefore, be ye

118
03:58:47,0 --> 03:58:47,0
strong from

119
03:58:47,0 --> 03:58:47,0
henceforth;

120
03:58:47,0 --> 03:58:47,0
fear not,

121
03:58:47,0 --> 03:58:47,0
for the

122
03:58:47,0 --> 04:04:52,
kingdom is yours.

123
04:04:52,0 --> 04:04:52,0
16 And for

124
04:04:52,0 --> 04:04:52,0
your

125
04:04:52,0 --> 04:04:52,0
salvation I

126
04:04:52,0 --> 04:04:52,0
give unto

127
04:04:52,0 --> 04:04:52,0
you a

128
04:04:52,0 --> 04:04:52,0
commandment, for

129
04:04:52,0 --> 04:04:52,0
I have

130
04:04:52,0 --> 04:04:52,0
heard your

131
04:04:52,0 --> 04:04:52,0
prayers,

132
04:04:52,0 --> 04:04:52,0
and the poor

133
04:04:52,0 --> 04:04:52,0
have

134
04:04:52,0 --> 04:04:52,0
complained

135
04:04:52,0 --> 04:04:52,0
before me,

136
04:04:52,0 --> 04:04:52,0
and the rich

137
04:04:52,0 --> 04:04:52,0
have I

138
04:04:52,0 --> 04:04:52,0
made, and

139
04:04:52,0 --> 04:04:52,0
all flesh is

140
04:04:52,0 --> 04:04:52,0
mine, and

141
04:04:52,0 --> 04:04:52,0
I am no

142
04:04:52,0 --> 04:27:53,
respecter of persons.

143
04:27:53,0 --> 04:27:53,0
17 And I

144
04:27:53,0 --> 04:27:53,0
have made

145
04:27:53,0 --> 04:27:53,0
the

146
04:27:53,0 --> 04:27:53,0
earth rich,

147
04:27:53,0 --> 04:27:53,0
and behold

148
04:27:53,0 --> 04:27:53,0
it is my

149
04:27:53,0 --> 04:27:53,0


150
04:27:53,0 --> 04:27:53,0
footstool,

151
04:27:53,0 --> 04:27:53,0
wherefore,

152
04:27:53,0 --> 04:27:53,0
again I will

153
04:27:53,0 --> 04:42:55,
stand upon it.

154
04:42:55,0 --> 04:42:55,0
18 And I

155
04:42:55,0 --> 04:42:55,0
hold

156
04:42:55,0 --> 04:42:55,0
forth and

157
04:42:55,0 --> 04:42:55,0
deign to

158
04:42:55,0 --> 04:42:55,0
give

159
04:42:55,0 --> 04:42:55,0

160
04:42:55,0 --> 04:42:55,0
greater

161
04:42:55,0 --> 04:42:55,0
riches,

162
04:42:55,0 --> 04:42:55,0
even a

163
04:42:55,0 --> 04:42:55,0
land of

164
04:42:55,0 --> 04:42:55,0
promise, a

165
04:42:55,0 --> 04:42:55,0
land

166
04:42:55,0 --> 04:42:55,0
flowing

167
04:42:55,0 --> 04:42:55,0
with milk

168
04:42:55,0 --> 04:42:55,0
and

169
04:42:55,0 --> 04:42:55,0
honey, upon

170
04:42:55,0 --> 04:42:55,0
which

171
04:42:55,0 --> 04:42:55,0
there

172
04:42:55,0 --> 04:42:55,0
shall be no

173
04:42:55,0 --> 05:11:56,
curse when the Lord cometh;

174
05:11:56,0 --> 05:11:56,0
19 And

175
05:11:56,0 --> 05:11:56,0
I will

176
05:11:56,0 --> 05:11:56,0
give it

177
05:11:56,0 --> 05:11:56,0
unto

178
05:11:56,0 --> 05:11:56,0
you for

179
05:11:56,0 --> 05:11:56,0
the

180
05:11:56,0 --> 05:11:56,0
land of

181
05:11:56,0 --> 05:11:56,0
your

05:11:56,0 --> 05:11:56,0


183
05:11:56,0 --> 05:11:56,0
inheritance, if

184
05:11:56,0 --> 05:11:56,0
you seek

185
05:11:56,0 --> 05:11:56,0
it with

186
05:11:56,0 --> 05:14:00,
all your hearts.

187
05:14:00,0 --> 05:14:00,0
20 And

188
05:14:00,0 --> 05:14:00,0
this

189
05:14:00,0 --> 05:14:00,0

190
05:14:00,0 --> 05:14:00,0
be my

192
05:14:00,0 --> 05:14:00,0
covenant

193
05:14:00,0 --> 05:14:00,0
with you,

194
05:14:00,0 --> 05:14:00,0
ye

195
05:14:00,0 --> 05:14:00,0
shall

196
05:14:00,0 --> 05:14:00,0
have it

197
05:14:00,0 --> 05:14:00,0

198
05:14:00,0 --> 05:14:00,0

210
05:14:00,0 --> 05:14:00,0
forever,

211
05:14:00,0 --> 05:14:00,0
while

214
05:14:00,0 --> 05:14:00,0

218
05:14:00,0 --> 05:14:00,0

05:14:00,0 --> 05:14:00,0
possess it

220
05:14:00,0 --> 05:28:34,

221
05:28:34,0 --> 05:28:34,0
21

222
05:28:34,0 --> 05:28:34,0
But,

223
