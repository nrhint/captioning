1
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:18,778
Section 38 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:18,778 --> 00:00:26,278
 the Prophet, at Fayette, New York, January 2, 1831.

3
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:33,778
 The occasion was a conference of the Church.

4
00:00:33,778 --> 00:00:41,278
1–6, Christ created all things; 
7–8, He is in the

5
00:00:41,278 --> 00:00:48,778
 midst of His Saints, who will soon see Him; 
9–12,

6
00:00:48,778 --> 00:00:56,278
 All flesh is corrupted before Him; 
13–22, He has

7
00:00:56,278 --> 00:01:03,778
 reserved a land of promise for His Saints in time

8
00:01:03,778 --> 00:01:11,278
 and in eternity; 
23–27, The Saints are commanded

9
00:01:11,278 --> 00:01:18,778
 to be one and esteem each other as brethren;

10
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:26,278
28–29, Wars are predicted; 
30–33, The Saints are to be

11
00:01:26,278 --> 00:01:33,778
 given power from on high and to go forth among

12
00:01:33,778 --> 00:01:41,278
 all nations; 
34–42, The Church is commanded to care

13
00:01:41,278 --> 00:01:48,778
 for the poor and needy and to seek the riches of

14
00:01:48,778 --> 00:01:56,278
 eternity.

15
00:01:56,683 --> 00:02:04,283
1 Thus saith the Lord your God, even Jesus Christ,

16
00:02:04,283 --> 00:02:11,883
 the Great I Am, Alpha and Omega, the beginning

17
00:02:11,883 --> 00:02:19,483
 and the end, the same which looked upon the wide

18
00:02:19,483 --> 00:02:27,083
 expanse of eternity, and all the seraphic hosts of

19
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:34,683
 heaven, before the world was made

20
00:02:34,438 --> 00:02:38,938
2 The same which knoweth all things, for all

21
00:02:38,938 --> 00:02:43,438
 things are present before mine eyes

22
00:02:43,73 --> 00:02:50,73
3 I am the same which spake, and the world was

23
00:02:50,73 --> 00:02:57,73
 made, and all things came by me

24
00:02:57,728 --> 00:03:04,895
4 I am the same which have taken the Zion of Enoch

25
00:03:04,895 --> 00:03:12,062
 into mine own bosom; and verily, I say, even as

26
00:03:12,062 --> 00:03:19,229
 many as have believed in my name, for I am Christ,

27
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:26,396
 and in mine own name, by the virtue of the blood

28
00:03:26,396 --> 00:03:33,563
 which I have spilt, have I pleaded before the

29
00:03:33,563 --> 00:03:40,73
 Father for them

30
00:03:40,22 --> 00:03:46,47
5 But behold, the residue of the wicked have I

31
00:03:46,47 --> 00:03:52,72
 kept in chains of darkness until the judgment of the

32
00:03:52,72 --> 00:03:58,97
 great day, which shall come at the end of the

33
00:03:58,97 --> 00:04:05,22
 earth

34
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:13,996
6 And even so will I cause the wicked to be kept,

35
00:04:13,996 --> 00:04:21,996
 that will not hear my voice but harden their

36
00:04:21,996 --> 00:04:29,996
 hearts, and wo, wo, wo, is their doom

37
00:04:29,486 --> 00:04:34,486
7 But behold, verily, verily, I say unto you that

38
00:04:34,486 --> 00:04:39,486
 mine eyes are upon you. I am in your midst and ye

39
00:04:39,486 --> 00:04:44,486
 cannot see me

40
00:04:44,0 --> 00:04:51,5
8 But the day soon cometh that ye shall see me,

41
00:04:51,5 --> 00:04:59,0
 and know that I am; for the veil of darkness shall

42
00:04:59,0 --> 00:05:06,5
 soon be rent, and he that is not purified shall not

43
00:05:06,5 --> 00:05:14,0
 abide the day

44
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:19,981
9 Wherefore, gird up your loins and be prepared.

45
00:05:19,981 --> 00:05:24,981
 Behold, the kingdom is yours, and the enemy shall

46
00:05:24,981 --> 00:05:29,981
 not overcome

47
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:34,079
10 Verily I say unto you, ye are clean, but not

48
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,412
 all; and there is none else with whom I am well

49
00:05:38,412 --> 00:05:42,745
 pleased

50
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:48,026
11 For all flesh is corrupted before me; and the

51
00:05:48,026 --> 00:05:53,276
 powers of darkness prevail upon the earth, among

52
00:05:53,276 --> 00:05:58,526
 the children of men, in the presence of all the

53
00:05:58,526 --> 00:06:03,776
 hosts of heaven

54
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:11,679
12 Which causeth silence to reign, and all

55
00:06:11,679 --> 00:06:20,279
 eternity is pained, and the angels are waiting the great

56
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:28,879
 command to reap down the earth, to gather the

57
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:37,479
 tares that they may be burned; and, behold, the enemy

58
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:46,079
 is combined

59
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:51,573
13 And now I show unto you a mystery, a thing

60
00:06:51,573 --> 00:06:56,823
 which is had in secret chambers, to bring to pass even

61
00:06:56,823 --> 00:07:02,073
 your destruction in process of time, and ye knew

62
00:07:02,073 --> 00:07:07,323
 it not

63
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:13,644
14 But now I tell it unto you, and ye are blessed,

64
00:07:13,644 --> 00:07:19,444
 not because of your iniquity, neither your hearts

65
00:07:19,444 --> 00:07:25,244
 of unbelief; for verily some of you are guilty

66
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:31,044
 before me, but I will be merciful unto your

67
00:07:31,044 --> 00:07:36,844
 weakness

68
00:07:36,673 --> 00:07:43,173
15 Therefore, be ye strong from henceforth; fear

69
00:07:43,173 --> 00:07:49,673
 not, for the kingdom is yours

70
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:56,702
16 And for your salvation I give unto you a

71
00:07:56,702 --> 00:08:03,902
 commandment, for I have heard your prayers, and the poor

72
00:08:03,902 --> 00:08:11,102
 have complained before me, and the rich have I

73
00:08:11,102 --> 00:08:18,302
 made, and all flesh is mine, and I am no respecter

74
00:08:18,302 --> 00:08:25,502
 of persons

75
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:31,571
17 And I have made the earth rich, and behold it

76
00:08:31,571 --> 00:08:37,904
 is my footstool, wherefore, again I will stand upon

77
00:08:37,904 --> 00:08:44,237
 it

78
00:08:44,24 --> 00:08:50,49
18 And I hold forth and deign to give unto you

79
00:08:50,49 --> 00:08:56,74
 greater riches, even a land of promise, a land

80
00:08:56,74 --> 00:09:02,99
 flowing with milk and honey, upon which there shall be

81
00:09:02,99 --> 00:09:09,24
 no curse when the Lord cometh

82
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:14,416
19 And I will give it unto you for the land of

83
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:19,083
 your inheritance, if you seek it with all your

84
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:23,75
 hearts

85
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:30,429
20 And this shall be my covenant with you, ye

86
00:09:30,429 --> 00:09:37,829
 shall have it for the land of your inheritance, and

87
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:45,229
 for the inheritance of your children forever, while

88
00:09:45,229 --> 00:09:52,629
 the earth shall stand, and ye shall possess it

89
00:09:52,629 --> 00:10:00,029
 again in eternity, no more to pass away

90
00:10:00,283 --> 00:10:06,283
21 But, verily I say unto you that in time ye

91
00:10:06,283 --> 00:10:12,283
 shall have no king nor ruler, for I will be your king

92
00:10:12,283 --> 00:10:18,283
 and watch over you

93
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:26,801
22 Wherefore, hear my voice and follow me, and you

94
00:10:26,801 --> 00:10:35,551
 shall be a free people, and ye shall have no laws

95
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:44,301
 but my laws when I come, for I am your lawgiver,

96
00:10:44,301 --> 00:10:53,051
 and what can stay my hand

97
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:57,886
23 But, verily I say unto you, teach one another

98
00:10:57,886 --> 00:11:02,219
 according to the office wherewith I have appointed

99
00:11:02,219 --> 00:11:06,552
 you

100
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:14,066
24 And let every man esteem his brother as

101
00:11:14,066 --> 00:11:21,566
 himself, and practice virtue and holiness before me

102
00:11:21,831 --> 00:11:28,831
25 And again I say unto you, let every man esteem

103
00:11:28,831 --> 00:11:35,831
 his brother as himself

104
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:43,528
26 For what man among you having twelve sons, and

105
00:11:43,528 --> 00:11:51,695
 is no respecter of them, and they serve him

106
00:11:51,695 --> 00:11:59,862
 obediently, and he saith unto the one: Be thou clothed

107
00:11:59,862 --> 00:12:08,029
 in robes and sit thou here; and to the other: Be

108
00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:16,196
 thou clothed in rags and sit thou there—and looketh

109
00:12:16,196 --> 00:12:24,363
 upon his sons and saith I am just

110
00:12:24,11 --> 00:12:31,443
27 Behold, this I have given unto you as a

111
00:12:31,443 --> 00:12:38,776
 parable, and it is even as I am. I say unto you, be one;

112
00:12:38,776 --> 00:12:46,109
 and if ye are not one ye are not mine

113
00:12:46,382 --> 00:12:51,882
28 And again, I say unto you that the enemy in the

114
00:12:51,882 --> 00:12:57,382
 secret chambers seeketh your lives

115
00:12:57,894 --> 00:13:06,394
29 Ye hear of wars in far countries, and you say

116
00:13:06,394 --> 00:13:14,894
 that there will soon be great wars in far

117
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:23,394
 countries, but ye know not the hearts of men in your own

118
00:13:23,394 --> 00:13:31,894
 land

119
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:38,644
30 I tell you these things because of your

120
00:13:38,644 --> 00:13:45,644
 prayers; wherefore, treasure up wisdom in your bosoms,

121
00:13:45,644 --> 00:13:52,644
 lest the wickedness of men reveal these things unto

122
00:13:52,644 --> 00:13:59,644
 you by their wickedness, in a manner which shall

123
00:13:59,644 --> 00:14:06,644
 speak in your ears with a voice louder than that

124
00:14:06,644 --> 00:14:13,644
 which shall shake the earth; but if ye are prepared

125
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:20,644
 ye shall not fear

126
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:26,594
31 And that ye might escape the power of the

127
00:14:26,594 --> 00:14:32,261
 enemy, and be gathered unto me a righteous people,

128
00:14:32,261 --> 00:14:37,928
 without spot and blameless

129
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:43,444
32 Wherefore, for this cause I gave unto you the

130
00:14:43,444 --> 00:14:48,944
 commandment that ye should go to the Ohio; and

131
00:14:48,944 --> 00:14:54,444
 there I will give unto you my law; and there you shall

132
00:14:54,444 --> 00:14:59,944
 be endowed with power from on high

133
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:06,866
33 And from thence, whosoever I will shall go

134
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:14,033
 forth among all nations, and it shall be told them

135
00:15:14,033 --> 00:15:21,2
 what they shall do; for I have a great work laid up

136
00:15:21,2 --> 00:15:28,367
 in store, for Israel shall be saved, and I will

137
00:15:28,367 --> 00:15:35,534
 lead them whithersoever I will, and no power shall

138
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:42,701
 stay my hand

139
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:47,175
34 And now, I give unto the church in these parts

140
00:15:47,175 --> 00:15:51,675
 a commandment, that certain men among them shall

141
00:15:51,675 --> 00:15:56,175
 be appointed, and they shall be appointed by the

142
00:15:56,175 --> 00:16:00,675
 voice of the church

143
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:06,193
35 And they shall look to the poor and the needy,

144
00:16:06,193 --> 00:16:11,693
 and administer to their relief that they shall not

145
00:16:11,693 --> 00:16:17,193
 suffer; and send them forth to the place which I

146
00:16:17,193 --> 00:16:22,693
 have commanded them

147
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:28,448
36 And this shall be their work, to govern the

148
00:16:28,448 --> 00:16:34,448
 affairs of the property of this church

149
00:16:34,21 --> 00:16:42,71
37 And they that have farms that cannot be sold,

150
00:16:42,71 --> 00:16:51,21
 let them be left or rented as seemeth them good

151
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:56,978
38 See that all things are preserved; and when men

152
00:16:56,978 --> 00:17:01,978
 are endowed with power from on high and sent

153
00:17:01,978 --> 00:17:06,978
 forth, all these things shall be gathered unto the

154
00:17:06,978 --> 00:17:11,978
 bosom of the church

155
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:19,064
39 And if ye seek the riches which it is the will

156
00:17:19,064 --> 00:17:26,397
 of the Father to give unto you, ye shall be the

157
00:17:26,397 --> 00:17:33,73
 richest of all people, for ye shall have the riches

158
00:17:33,73 --> 00:17:41,063
 of eternity; and it must needs be that the riches

159
00:17:41,063 --> 00:17:48,396
 of the earth are mine to give; but beware of

160
00:17:48,396 --> 00:17:55,729
 pride, lest ye become as the Nephites of old

161
00:17:55,458 --> 00:18:01,058
40 And again, I say unto you, I give unto you a

162
00:18:01,058 --> 00:18:06,658
 commandment, that every man, both elder, priest,

163
00:18:06,658 --> 00:18:12,258
 teacher, and also member, go to with his might, with

164
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:17,858
 the labor of his hands, to prepare and accomplish

165
00:18:17,858 --> 00:18:23,458
 the things which I have commanded

166
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:29,869
41 And let your preaching be the warning voice,

167
00:18:29,869 --> 00:18:36,536
 every man to his neighbor, in mildness and in

168
00:18:36,536 --> 00:18:43,203
 meekness

169
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:50,522
42 And go ye out from among the wicked. Save

170
00:18:50,522 --> 00:18:57,855
 yourselves. Be ye clean that bear the vessels of the

171
00:18:57,855 --> 00:19:05,188
 Lord. Even so. Amen.
