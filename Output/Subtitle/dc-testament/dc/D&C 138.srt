Section 138 A vision given to President Joseph F.

2
00:00:17,586 --> 00:00:23,894
 Smith in Salt Lake City, Utah, on October 3, 1918.

3
00:00:23,894 --> 00:00:30,202
 In his opening address at the 89th Semiannual

4
00:00:30,202 --> 00:00:36,51
 General Conference of the Church, on October 4, 1918,

5
00:00:36,51 --> 00:00:42,818
 President Smith declared that he had received

6
00:00:42,818 --> 00:00:49,126
 several divine communications during the previous

7
00:00:49,126 --> 00:00:55,434
 months. One of these, concerning the Savior’s visit

8
00:00:55,434 --> 00:01:01,742
 to the spirits of the dead while His body was in

9
00:01:01,742 --> 00:01:08,05
 the tomb, President Smith had received the previous

10
00:01:08,05 --> 00:01:14,358
 day. It was written immediately following the

11
00:01:14,358 --> 00:01:20,666
 close of the conference. On October 31, 1918, it was

12
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:26,974
 submitted to the counselors in the First

13
00:01:26,974 --> 00:01:33,282
 Presidency, the Council of the Twelve, and the Patriarch,

14
00:01:33,282 --> 00:01:39,59
 and it was unanimously accepted by them. 
1–10,

15
00:01:39,59 --> 00:01:45,898
 President Joseph F. Smith ponders upon the writings of

16
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:52,206
 Peter and our Lord’s visit to the spirit world;

17
00:01:52,206 --> 00:01:58,514
11–24, President Smith sees the righteous dead

18
00:01:58,514 --> 00:02:04,822
 assembled in paradise and Christ’s ministry among

19
00:02:04,822 --> 00:02:11,13
 them; 
25–37, He sees how the preaching of the gospel

20
00:02:11,13 --> 00:02:17,438
 was organized among the spirits; 
38–52, He sees

21
00:02:17,438 --> 00:02:23,746
 Adam, Eve, and many of the holy prophets in the

22
00:02:23,746 --> 00:02:30,054
 spirit world who considered their spirit state

23
00:02:30,054 --> 00:02:36,362
 before their resurrection as a bondage; 
53–60, The

24
00:02:36,362 --> 00:02:42,67
 righteous dead of this day continue their labors in

25
00:02:42,67 --> 00:02:48,978
 the world of spirits.

27
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:59,142
1 On the third of October, in the year nineteen

28
00:02:59,142 --> 00:03:02,475
 hundred and eighteen, I sat in my room pondering

29
00:03:02,475 --> 00:03:05,808
 over the scriptures

30
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:08,485
2 And reflecting upon the great atoning sacrifice

31
00:03:08,485 --> 00:03:11,818
 that was made by the Son of God, for the

32
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:15,151
 redemption of the world

33
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:20,929
3 And the great and wonderful love made manifest

34
00:03:20,929 --> 00:03:25,929
 by the Father and the Son in the coming of the

35
00:03:25,929 --> 00:03:30,929
 Redeemer into the world

36
00:03:30,927 --> 00:03:35,594
4 That through his atonement, and by obedience to

37
00:03:35,594 --> 00:03:40,261
 the principles of the gospel, mankind might be

38
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:44,928
 saved

39
00:03:44,007 --> 00:03:49,674
5 While I was thus engaged, my mind reverted to

40
00:03:49,674 --> 00:03:55,341
 the writings of the apostle Peter, to the primitive

41
00:03:55,341 --> 00:04:01,008
 saints scattered abroad throughout Pontus,

42
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:06,675
 Galatia, Cappadocia, and other parts of Asia, where the

43
00:04:06,675 --> 00:04:12,342
 gospel had been preached after the crucifixion of

44
00:04:12,342 --> 00:04:18,009
 the Lord

45
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:25,009
6 I opened the Bible and read the third and fourth

46
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:31,259
 chapters of the first epistle of Peter, and as I

47
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:37,509
 read I was greatly impressed, more than I had ever

48
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:43,759
 been before, with the following passages

49
00:04:43,8 --> 00:04:52,3
7 “For Christ also hath once suffered for sins,

50
00:04:52,3 --> 00:05:00,8
 the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to

51
00:05:00,8 --> 00:05:09,3
 God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened

52
00:05:09,3 --> 00:05:17,8
 by the Spirit

53
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:23,067
8 “By which also he went and preached unto the

54
00:05:23,067 --> 00:05:29,067
 spirits in prison

55
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:35,062
9 “Which sometime were disobedient, when once the

56
00:05:35,062 --> 00:05:41,062
 longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah,

57
00:05:41,062 --> 00:05:47,062
 while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that

58
00:05:47,062 --> 00:05:53,062
 is, eight souls were saved by water.” 

59
00:05:53,603 --> 00:06:00,853
10 “For for this cause was the gospel preached

60
00:06:00,853 --> 00:06:08,103
 also to them that are dead, that they might be judged

61
00:06:08,103 --> 00:06:15,353
 according to men in the flesh, but live according

62
00:06:15,353 --> 00:06:22,603
 to God in the spirit.” 

63
00:06:22,866 --> 00:06:28,616
11 As I pondered over these things which are

64
00:06:28,616 --> 00:06:34,366
 written, the eyes of my understanding were opened, and

65
00:06:34,366 --> 00:06:40,116
 the Spirit of the Lord rested upon me, and I saw

66
00:06:40,116 --> 00:06:45,866
 the hosts of the dead, both small and great

67
00:06:45,855 --> 00:06:48,855
12 And there were gathered together in one place

68
00:06:48,855 --> 00:06:51,855
 an innumerable company of the spirits of the just,

69
00:06:51,855 --> 00:06:54,855
 who had been faithful in the testimony of Jesus

70
00:06:54,855 --> 00:06:57,855
 while they lived in mortality

71
00:06:57,367 --> 00:07:06,7
13 And who had offered sacrifice in the similitude

72
00:07:06,7 --> 00:07:16,033
 of the great sacrifice of the Son of God, and had

73
00:07:16,033 --> 00:07:25,366
 suffered tribulation in their Redeemer’s name

74
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:30,879
14 All these had departed the mortal life, firm in

75
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:35,879
 the hope of a glorious resurrection, through the

76
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:40,879
 grace of God the Father and his Only Begotten Son,

77
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:45,879
 Jesus Christ

78
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:50,599
15 I beheld that they were filled with joy and

79
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:55,266
 gladness, and were rejoicing together because the day

80
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:59,933
 of their deliverance was at hand

81
00:07:59,963 --> 00:08:06,963
16 They were assembled awaiting the advent of the

82
00:08:06,963 --> 00:08:13,963
 Son of God into the spirit world, to declare their

83
00:08:13,963 --> 00:08:20,963
 redemption from the bands of death

84
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:29,334
17 Their sleeping dust was to be restored unto its

85
00:08:29,334 --> 00:08:37,934
 perfect frame, bone to his bone, and the sinews

86
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:46,534
 and the flesh upon them, the spirit and the body to

87
00:08:46,534 --> 00:08:55,134
 be united never again to be divided, that they

88
00:08:55,134 --> 00:09:03,734
 might receive a fulness of joy

89
00:09:03,226 --> 00:09:07,626
18 While this vast multitude waited and conversed,

90
00:09:07,626 --> 00:09:12,026
 rejoicing in the hour of their deliverance from

91
00:09:12,026 --> 00:09:16,426
 the chains of death, the Son of God appeared,

92
00:09:16,426 --> 00:09:20,826
 declaring liberty to the captives who had been

93
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:25,226
 faithful

94
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:31,248
19 And there he preached to them the everlasting

95
00:09:31,248 --> 00:09:36,998
 gospel, the doctrine of the resurrection and the

96
00:09:36,998 --> 00:09:42,748
 redemption of mankind from the fall, and from

97
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:48,498
 individual sins on conditions of repentance

98
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:53,738
20 But unto the wicked he did not go, and among

99
00:09:53,738 --> 00:09:58,488
 the ungodly and the unrepentant who had defiled

100
00:09:58,488 --> 00:10:03,238
 themselves while in the flesh, his voice was not

101
00:10:03,238 --> 00:10:07,988
 raised

102
00:10:07,757 --> 00:10:15,757
21 Neither did the rebellious who rejected the

103
00:10:15,757 --> 00:10:23,757
 testimonies and the warnings of the ancient prophets

104
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:31,757
 behold his presence, nor look upon his face

105
00:10:31,014 --> 00:10:38,514
22 Where these were, darkness reigned, but among

106
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:46,014
 the righteous there was peace

107
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:52,779
23 And the saints rejoiced in their redemption,

108
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:59,029
 and bowed the knee and acknowledged the Son of God

109
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:05,279
 as their Redeemer and Deliverer from death and the

110
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:11,529
 chains of hell

111
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:17,471
24 Their countenances shone, and the radiance from

112
00:11:17,471 --> 00:11:23,138
 the presence of the Lord rested upon them, and

113
00:11:23,138 --> 00:11:28,805
 they sang praises unto his holy name

114
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:33,104
25 I marveled, for I understood that the Savior

115
00:11:33,104 --> 00:11:38,104
 spent about three years in his ministry among the

116
00:11:38,104 --> 00:11:43,104
 Jews and those of the house of Israel, endeavoring

117
00:11:43,104 --> 00:11:48,104
 to teach them the everlasting gospel and call them

118
00:11:48,104 --> 00:11:53,104
 unto repentance

119
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:59,712
26 And yet, notwithstanding his mighty works, and

120
00:11:59,712 --> 00:12:06,312
 miracles, and proclamation of the truth, in great

121
00:12:06,312 --> 00:12:12,912
 power and authority, there were but few who

122
00:12:12,912 --> 00:12:19,512
 hearkened to his voice, and rejoiced in his presence,

123
00:12:19,512 --> 00:12:26,112
 and received salvation at his hands

124
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:32,379
27 But his ministry among those who were dead was

125
00:12:32,379 --> 00:12:38,379
 limited to the brief time intervening between the

126
00:12:38,379 --> 00:12:44,379
 crucifixion and his resurrection

127
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:51,807
28 And I wondered at the words of Peter—wherein he

128
00:12:51,807 --> 00:12:58,95
 said that the Son of God preached unto the

129
00:12:58,95 --> 00:13:06,093
 spirits in prison, who sometime were disobedient, when

130
00:13:06,093 --> 00:13:13,236
 once the long-suffering of God waited in the days

131
00:13:13,236 --> 00:13:20,379
 of Noah—and how it was possible for him to preach

132
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:27,522
 to those spirits and perform the necessary labor

133
00:13:27,522 --> 00:13:34,665
 among them in so short a time

134
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:40,047
29 And as I wondered, my eyes were opened, and my

135
00:13:40,047 --> 00:13:45,447
 understanding quickened, and I perceived that the

136
00:13:45,447 --> 00:13:50,847
 Lord went not in person among the wicked and the

137
00:13:50,847 --> 00:13:56,247
 disobedient who had rejected the truth, to teach

138
00:13:56,247 --> 00:14:01,647
 them

139
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:07,479
30 But behold, from among the righteous, he

140
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:13,05
 organized his forces and appointed messengers, clothed

141
00:14:13,05 --> 00:14:18,621
 with power and authority, and commissioned them to

142
00:14:18,621 --> 00:14:24,192
 go forth and carry the light of the gospel to them

143
00:14:24,192 --> 00:14:29,763
 that were in darkness, even to all the spirits of

144
00:14:29,763 --> 00:14:35,334
 men; and thus was the gospel preached to the

145
00:14:35,334 --> 00:14:40,905
 dead

146
00:14:40,163 --> 00:14:45,963
31 And the chosen messengers went forth to declare

147
00:14:45,963 --> 00:14:51,763
 the acceptable day of the Lord and proclaim

148
00:14:51,763 --> 00:14:57,563
 liberty to the captives who were bound, even unto all

149
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:03,363
 who would repent of their sins and receive the

150
00:15:03,363 --> 00:15:09,163
 gospel

151
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:14,409
32 Thus was the gospel preached to those who had

152
00:15:14,409 --> 00:15:19,159
 died in their sins, without a knowledge of the

153
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:23,909
 truth, or in transgression, having rejected the

154
00:15:23,909 --> 00:15:28,659
 prophets

155
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:33,678
33 These were taught faith in God, repentance from

156
00:15:33,678 --> 00:15:38,428
 sin, vicarious baptism for the remission of sins,

157
00:15:38,428 --> 00:15:43,178
 the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of

158
00:15:43,178 --> 00:15:47,928
 hands

159
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:52,097
34 And all other principles of the gospel that

160
00:15:52,097 --> 00:15:56,497
 were necessary for them to know in order to qualify

161
00:15:56,497 --> 00:16:00,897
 themselves that they might be judged according to

162
00:16:00,897 --> 00:16:05,297
 men in the flesh, but live according to God in the

163
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:09,697
 spirit

164
00:16:09,452 --> 00:16:15,202
35 And so it was made known among the dead, both

165
00:16:15,202 --> 00:16:20,952
 small and great, the unrighteous as well as the

166
00:16:20,952 --> 00:16:26,702
 faithful, that redemption had been wrought through

167
00:16:26,702 --> 00:16:32,452
 the sacrifice of the Son of God upon the cross

168
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:37,208
36 Thus was it made known that our Redeemer spent

169
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:42,208
 his time during his sojourn in the world of

170
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:47,208
 spirits, instructing and preparing the faithful spirits

171
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:52,208
 of the prophets who had testified of him in the

172
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:57,208
 flesh

173
00:16:57,717 --> 00:17:05,117
37 That they might carry the message of redemption

174
00:17:05,117 --> 00:17:12,517
 unto all the dead, unto whom he could not go

175
00:17:12,517 --> 00:17:19,917
 personally, because of their rebellion and

176
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:27,317
 transgression, that they through the ministration of his

177
00:17:27,317 --> 00:17:34,717
 servants might also hear his words

178
00:17:34,22 --> 00:17:39,22
38 Among the great and mighty ones who were

179
00:17:39,22 --> 00:17:44,22
 assembled in this vast congregation of the righteous

180
00:17:44,22 --> 00:17:49,22
 were Father Adam, the Ancient of Days and father of

181
00:17:49,22 --> 00:17:54,22
 all

182
00:17:54,74 --> 00:18:00,407
39 And our glorious Mother Eve, with many of her

183
00:18:00,407 --> 00:18:06,074
 faithful daughters who had lived through the ages

184
00:18:06,074 --> 00:18:11,741
 and worshiped the true and living God

185
00:18:11,274 --> 00:18:17,941
40 Abel, the first martyr, was there, and his

186
00:18:17,941 --> 00:18:24,608
 brother Seth, one of the mighty ones, who was in the

187
00:18:24,608 --> 00:18:31,275
 express image of his father, Adam

188
00:18:31,794 --> 00:18:40,294
41 Noah, who gave warning of the flood; Shem, the

189
00:18:40,294 --> 00:18:48,794
 great high priest; Abraham, the father of the

190
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:57,294
 faithful; Isaac, Jacob, and Moses, the great law-giver

191
00:18:57,294 --> 00:19:05,794
 of Israel

192
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:12,261
42 And Isaiah, who declared by prophecy that the

193
00:19:12,261 --> 00:19:19,461
 Redeemer was anointed to bind up the

194
00:19:19,461 --> 00:19:26,661
 broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the

195
00:19:26,661 --> 00:19:33,861
 opening of the prison to them that were bound, were

196
00:19:33,861 --> 00:19:41,061
 also there

197
00:19:41,33 --> 00:19:46,08
43 Moreover, Ezekiel, who was shown in vision the

198
00:19:46,08 --> 00:19:50,83
 great valley of dry bones, which were to be

199
00:19:50,83 --> 00:19:55,58
 clothed upon with flesh, to come forth again in the

200
00:19:55,58 --> 00:20:00,33
 resurrection of the dead, living souls

201
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:04,583
44 Daniel, who foresaw and foretold the

202
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:08,333
 establishment of the kingdom of God in the latter days,

203
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:12,083
 never again to be destroyed nor given to other people

204
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:15,833


205
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:23,348
45 Elias, who was with Moses on the Mount of

206
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:30,848
 Transfiguration

207
00:20:30,846 --> 00:20:40,446
46 And Malachi, the prophet who testified of the

208
00:20:40,446 --> 00:20:50,046
 coming of Elijah—of whom also Moroni spake to the

209
00:20:50,046 --> 00:20:59,646
 Prophet Joseph Smith, declaring that he should come

210
00:20:59,646 --> 00:21:09,246
 before the ushering in of the great and dreadful

211
00:21:09,246 --> 00:21:18,846
 day of the Lord—were also there

212
00:21:18,794 --> 00:21:19,127
47 The Prophet Elijah was to plant in the hearts

213
00:21:19,127 --> 00:21:19,46
 of the children the promises made to their fathers

214
00:21:19,46 --> 00:21:19,793


215
00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:25,812
48 Foreshadowing the great work to be done in the

216
00:21:25,812 --> 00:21:32,479
 temples of the Lord in the dispensation of the

217
00:21:32,479 --> 00:21:39,146
 fulness of times, for the redemption of the dead, and

218
00:21:39,146 --> 00:21:45,813
 the sealing of the children to their parents,

219
00:21:45,813 --> 00:21:52,48
 lest the whole earth be smitten with a curse and

220
00:21:52,48 --> 00:21:59,147
 utterly wasted at his coming

221
00:21:59,101 --> 00:22:06,851
49 All these and many more, even the prophets who

222
00:22:06,851 --> 00:22:14,601
 dwelt among the Nephites and testified of the

223
00:22:14,601 --> 00:22:22,351
 coming of the Son of God, mingled in the vast assembly

224
00:22:22,351 --> 00:22:30,101
 and waited for their deliverance

225
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:38,149
50 For the dead had looked upon the long absence

226
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:45,649
 of their spirits from their bodies as a bondage

227
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:52,431
51 These the Lord taught, and gave them power to

228
00:22:52,431 --> 00:22:58,931
 come forth, after his resurrection from the dead,

229
00:22:58,931 --> 00:23:05,431
 to enter into his Father’s kingdom, there to be

230
00:23:05,431 --> 00:23:11,931
 crowned with immortality and eternal life

231
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:17,174
52 And continue thenceforth their labor as had

232
00:23:17,174 --> 00:23:22,424
 been promised by the Lord, and be partakers of all

233
00:23:22,424 --> 00:23:27,674
 blessings which were held in reserve for them that

234
00:23:27,674 --> 00:23:32,924
 love him

235
00:23:32,928 --> 00:23:43,761
53 The Prophet Joseph Smith, and my father, Hyrum

236
00:23:43,761 --> 00:23:54,594
 Smith, Brigham Young, John Taylor, Wilford

237
00:23:54,594 --> 00:24:05,427
 Woodruff, and other choice spirits who were reserved to

238
00:24:05,427 --> 00:24:16,26
 come forth in the fulness of times to take part in

239
00:24:16,26 --> 00:24:27,093
 laying the foundations of the great latter-day

240
00:24:27,093 --> 00:24:37,926
 work

241
00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:41,843
54 Including the building of the temples and the

242
00:24:41,843 --> 00:24:46,51
 performance of ordinances therein for the

243
00:24:46,51 --> 00:24:51,177
 redemption of the dead, were also in the spirit world

244
00:24:51,457 --> 00:24:59,79
55 I observed that they were also among the noble

245
00:24:59,79 --> 00:25:08,123
 and great ones who were chosen in the beginning to

246
00:25:08,123 --> 00:25:16,456
 be rulers in the Church of God

247
00:25:16,732 --> 00:25:22,132
56 Even before they were born, they, with many

248
00:25:22,132 --> 00:25:27,532
 others, received their first lessons in the world of

249
00:25:27,532 --> 00:25:32,932
 spirits and were prepared to come forth in the due

250
00:25:32,932 --> 00:25:38,332
 time of the Lord to labor in his vineyard for the

251
00:25:38,332 --> 00:25:43,732
 salvation of the souls of men

252
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:48,008
57 I beheld that the faithful elders of this

253
00:25:48,008 --> 00:25:53,008
 dispensation, when they depart from mortal life,

254
00:25:53,008 --> 00:25:58,008
 continue their labors in the preaching of the gospel of

255
00:25:58,008 --> 00:26:03,008
 repentance and redemption, through the sacrifice

256
00:26:03,008 --> 00:26:08,008
 of the Only Begotten Son of God, among those who

257
00:26:08,008 --> 00:26:13,008
 are in darkness and under the bondage of sin in the

258
00:26:13,008 --> 00:26:18,008
 great world of the spirits of the dead

259
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:24,744
58 The dead who repent will be redeemed, through

260
00:26:24,744 --> 00:26:30,744
 obedience to the ordinances of the house of God

261
00:26:30,739 --> 00:26:36,239
59 And after they have paid the penalty of their

262
00:26:36,239 --> 00:26:41,739
 transgressions, and are washed clean, shall receive

263
00:26:41,739 --> 00:26:47,239
 a reward according to their works, for they are

264
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:52,739
 heirs of salvation

265
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:57,027
60 Thus was the vision of the redemption of the

266
00:26:57,027 --> 00:27:02,027
 dead revealed to me, and I bear record, and I know

267
00:27:02,027 --> 00:27:07,027
 that this record is true, through the blessing of

268
00:27:07,027 --> 00:27:12,027
 our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, even so. Amen.
