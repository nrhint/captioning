Section 138 A vision given to President

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Joseph F. Smith in Salt Lake City, Utah, on October 3,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
1918. In his opening address at the 89th

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Semiannual General Conference of the Church, on October

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
4, 1918, President Smith declared that he had

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
received several divine communications during the

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
previous months. One of these, concerning the

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Savior’s visit to the spirits of the dead while

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
His body was in the tomb, President Smith had

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
received the previous day. It was written

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
immediately following the close of the conference. On

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
October 31, 1918, it was submitted to the counselors

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
in the First Presidency, the Council of the

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Twelve, and the Patriarch, and it was unanimously

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
accepted by them. 
1–10, President Joseph F.

16
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Smith ponders upon the writings of Peter and our

17
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Lord’s visit to the spirit world; 
11–24, President

18
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Smith sees the righteous dead assembled in

19
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
paradise and Christ’s ministry among them; 
25–37,

20
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
He sees how the preaching of the gospel was

21
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
organized among the spirits; 
38–52, He sees Adam,

22
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Eve, and many of the holy prophets in the spirit

23
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
world who considered their spirit state before

24
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
their resurrection as a bondage; 
53–60, The

25
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
righteous dead of this day continue their labors in

26
00:00:00,0 --> 02:54:42,
the world of spirits.

27
02:54:42,0 --> 02:54:42,0
1 On the third of October, in the year

28
02:54:42,0 --> 02:54:42,0
nineteen hundred and eighteen, I sat in

29
02:54:42,0 --> 02:59:47,
my room pondering over the scriptures;

30
02:59:47,0 --> 02:59:47,0
2 And reflecting upon the great

31
02:59:47,0 --> 02:59:47,0
atoning sacrifice that was made by the Son

32
02:59:47,0 --> 03:04:24,
of God, for the redemption of the world;

33
03:04:24,0 --> 03:04:24,0
3 And the great and wonderful

34
03:04:24,0 --> 03:04:24,0
love made manifest by the

35
03:04:24,0 --> 03:04:24,0
Father and the Son in the coming

36
03:04:24,0 --> 03:22:25,
of the Redeemer into the world;

37
03:22:25,0 --> 03:22:25,0
4 That through his

38
03:22:25,0 --> 03:22:25,0
atonement, and by obedience to

39
03:22:25,0 --> 03:22:25,0
the principles of the

40
03:22:25,0 --> 03:29:28,
gospel, mankind might be saved.

41
03:29:28,0 --> 03:29:28,0
5 While I was thus

42
03:29:28,0 --> 03:29:28,0
engaged, my mind reverted

43
03:29:28,0 --> 03:29:28,0
to the writings of the

44
03:29:28,0 --> 03:29:28,0
apostle Peter, to the

45
03:29:28,0 --> 03:29:28,0
primitive saints

46
03:29:28,0 --> 03:29:28,0
scattered abroad throughout

47
03:29:28,0 --> 03:29:28,0
Pontus, Galatia,

48
03:29:28,0 --> 03:29:28,0
Cappadocia, and other parts of

49
03:29:28,0 --> 03:29:28,0
Asia, where the gospel

50
03:29:28,0 --> 03:29:28,0
had been preached after

51
03:29:28,0 --> 03:34:33,
the crucifixion of the Lord.

52
03:34:33,0 --> 03:34:33,0
6 I opened the Bible

53
03:34:33,0 --> 03:34:33,0
and read the third

54
03:34:33,0 --> 03:34:33,0
and fourth chapters of

55
03:34:33,0 --> 03:34:33,0
the first epistle of

56
03:34:33,0 --> 03:34:33,0
Peter, and as I read

57
03:34:33,0 --> 03:34:33,0
I was greatly

58
03:34:33,0 --> 03:34:33,0
impressed, more than I had

59
03:34:33,0 --> 03:34:33,0
ever been before, with

60
03:34:33,0 --> 03:41:36,
the following passages:

61
03:41:36,0 --> 03:41:36,0
7 “For Christ also

62
03:41:36,0 --> 03:41:36,0
hath once suffered

63
03:41:36,0 --> 03:41:36,0
for sins, the just for

64
03:41:36,0 --> 03:41:36,0
the unjust, that he

65
03:41:36,0 --> 03:41:36,0
might bring us to

66
03:41:36,0 --> 03:41:36,0
God, being put to

67
03:41:36,0 --> 03:41:36,0
death in the flesh, but

68
03:41:36,0 --> 03:42:40,
quickened by the Spirit:

69
03:42:40,0 --> 03:42:40,0
8 “By which also

70
03:42:40,0 --> 03:42:40,0
he went and

71
03:42:40,0 --> 03:42:40,0
preached unto the

72
03:42:40,0 --> 04:18:15,
spirits in prison;

73
04:18:15,0 --> 04:18:15,0
9 “Which

74
04:18:15,0 --> 04:18:15,0
sometime were

75
04:18:15,0 --> 04:18:15,0
disobedient, when once

76
04:18:15,0 --> 04:18:15,0
the

77
04:18:15,0 --> 04:18:15,0
longsuffering of God

78
04:18:15,0 --> 04:18:15,0
waited in the days

79
04:18:15,0 --> 04:18:15,0
of Noah, while

80
04:18:15,0 --> 04:18:15,0
the ark was a

81
04:18:15,0 --> 04:18:15,0
preparing,

82
04:18:15,0 --> 04:18:15,0
wherein few, that

83
04:18:15,0 --> 04:18:15,0
is, eight souls

84
04:18:15,0 --> 04:41:16,
were saved by water.” (

85
04:41:16,0 --> 04:41:16,0
10 “For for

86
04:41:16,0 --> 04:41:16,0
this cause was

87
04:41:16,0 --> 04:41:16,0
the gospel

88
04:41:16,0 --> 04:41:16,0
preached also to

89
04:41:16,0 --> 04:41:16,0
them that are

90
04:41:16,0 --> 04:41:16,0
dead, that they

91
04:41:16,0 --> 04:41:16,0
might be

92
04:41:16,0 --> 04:41:16,0
judged according

93
04:41:16,0 --> 04:41:16,0
to men in the

94
04:41:16,0 --> 04:41:16,0
flesh, but live

95
04:41:16,0 --> 04:41:16,0
according to

96
04:41:16,0 --> 04:42:20,
God in the spirit.” (

97
04:42:20,0 --> 04:42:20,0
11 As I

98
04:42:20,0 --> 04:42:20,0
pondered over

99
04:42:20,0 --> 04:42:20,0
these things

100
04:42:20,0 --> 04:42:20,0
which are

101
04:42:20,0 --> 04:42:20,0
written, the eyes of

102
04:42:20,0 --> 04:42:20,0
my

103
04:42:20,0 --> 04:42:20,0
understanding were

104
04:42:20,0 --> 04:42:20,0
opened, and the

105
04:42:20,0 --> 04:42:20,0
Spirit of the

106
04:42:20,0 --> 04:42:20,0
Lord rested

107
04:42:20,0 --> 04:42:20,0
upon me, and

108
04:42:20,0 --> 04:42:20,0
I saw the

109
04:42:20,0 --> 04:42:20,0
hosts of the

110
04:42:20,0 --> 05:15:20,
dead, both small and great.

111
05:15:20,0 --> 05:15:20,0
12 And there

112
05:15:20,0 --> 05:15:20,0
were

113
05:15:20,0 --> 05:15:20,0
gathered together

114
05:15:20,0 --> 05:15:20,0
in one place

115
05:15:20,0 --> 05:15:20,0
an

116
05:15:20,0 --> 05:15:20,0
innumerable company

117
05:15:20,0 --> 05:15:20,0
of the

118
05:15:20,0 --> 05:15:20,0
spirits of the

119
05:15:20,0 --> 05:15:20,0
just, who had

120
05:15:20,0 --> 05:15:20,0
been

121
05:15:20,0 --> 05:15:20,0
faithful in the

122
05:15:20,0 --> 05:15:20,0
testimony of

123
05:15:20,0 --> 05:15:20,0
Jesus while

124
05:15:20,0 --> 05:28:24,
they lived in mortality;

125
05:28:24,0 --> 05:28:24,0
13 And who

126
05:28:24,0 --> 05:28:24,0
had offered

127
05:28:24,0 --> 05:28:24,0
sacrifice

128
05:28:24,0 --> 05:28:24,0
in the

129
05:28:24,0 --> 05:28:24,0
similitude of

130
05:28:24,0 --> 05:28:24,0
the great

131
05:28:24,0 --> 05:28:24,0
sacrifice of

132
05:28:24,0 --> 05:28:24,0
the Son of

133
05:28:24,0 --> 05:28:24,0
God, and

134
05:28:24,0 --> 05:28:24,0
had suffered

135
05:28:24,0 --> 05:28:24,0
tribulation

136
05:28:24,0 --> 05:28:24,0
in their

137
05:28:24,0 --> 05:49:27,
Redeemer’s name.

138
05:49:27,0 --> 05:49:27,0
14 All

139
05:49:27,0 --> 05:49:27,0
these had

140
05:49:27,0 --> 05:49:27,0
departed the

141
05:49:27,0 --> 05:49:27,0
mortal

142
05:49:27,0 --> 05:49:27,0
life, firm in

143
05:49:27,0 --> 05:49:27,0
the hope

144
05:49:27,0 --> 05:49:27,0
of a

145
05:49:27,0 --> 05:49:27,0
glorious

146
05:49:27,0 --> 05:49:27,0
resurrection,

147
05:49:27,0 --> 05:49:27,0
through the

148
05:49:27,0 --> 05:49:27,0
grace of

149
05:49:27,0 --> 05:49:27,0
God the

150
05:49:27,0 --> 05:49:27,0
Father and

151
05:49:27,0 --> 05:49:27,0
his Only

152
05:49:27,0 --> 05:53:06,
Begotten Son, Jesus Christ.

153
05:53:06,0 --> 05:53:06,0
15 I

154
05:53:06,0 --> 05:53:06,0
beheld that

155
05:53:06,0 --> 05:53:06,0
they were

156
05:53:06,0 --> 05:53:06,0
filled

157
05:53:06,0 --> 05:53:06,0
with joy

158
05:53:06,0 --> 05:53:06,0
and

159
05:53:06,0 --> 05:53:06,0
gladness, and

160
05:53:06,0 --> 05:53:06,0
were

161
05:53:06,0 --> 05:53:06,0
rejoicing

162
05:53:06,0 --> 05:53:06,0
together

163
05:53:06,0 --> 05:53:06,0
because the

164
05:53:06,0 --> 05:53:06,0
day of

165
05:53:06,0 --> 05:53:06,0
their

166
05:53:06,0 --> 06:22:08,
deliverance was at hand.

167
06:22:08,0 --> 06:22:08,0
16 They

168
06:22:08,0 --> 06:22:08,0
were

169
06:22:08,0 --> 06:22:08,0
assembled

170
06:22:08,0 --> 06:22:08,0
awaiting

171
06:22:08,0 --> 06:22:08,0
the

172
06:22:08,0 --> 06:22:08,0
advent of

173
06:22:08,0 --> 06:22:08,0
the Son of

174
06:22:08,0 --> 06:22:08,0
God

175
06:22:08,0 --> 06:22:08,0
into the

176
06:22:08,0 --> 06:22:08,0
spirit

177
06:22:08,0 --> 06:22:08,0
world, to

178
06:22:08,0 --> 06:22:08,0
declare

179
06:22:08,0 --> 06:22:08,0
their

180
06:22:08,0 --> 06:22:08,0
redemption

181
06:22:08,0 --> 06:22:08,0
from the

182
06:22:08,0 --> 06:43:11,
bands of death.

183
06:43:11,0 --> 06:43:11,0
17

184
06:43:11,0 --> 06:43:11,0
Their

185
06:43:11,0 --> 06:43:11,0
sleeping

186
06:43:11,0 --> 06:43:11,0
dust was

187
06:43:11,0 --> 06:43:11,0
to be

188
06:43:11,0 --> 06:43:11,0
restored

189
06:43:11,0 --> 06:43:11,0
unto

190
06:43:11,0 --> 06:43:11,0
its

191
06:43:11,0 --> 06:43:11,0
perfect

06:43:11,0 --> 06:43:11,0

194
06:43:11,0 --> 06:43:11,0
bone,

195
06:43:11,0 --> 06:43:11,0
and the

196
06:43:11,0 --> 06:43:11,0
sinews

197
06:43:11,0 --> 06:43:11,0
and

198
06:43:11,0 --> 06:43:11,0
the flesh

199
06:43:11,0 --> 06:43:11,0
upon

200
06:43:11,0 --> 06:43:11,0
them,

201
06:43:11,0 --> 06:43:11,0
the

06:43:11,0 --> 06:43:11,0
united

206
06:43:11,0 --> 06:43:11,0
never

207
06:43:11,0 --> 06:43:11,0
again to

208
06:43:11,0 --> 06:43:11,0
be

209
06:43:11,0 --> 06:43:11,0
divided,

210
06:43:11,0 --> 06:43:11,0
that

211
06:43:11,0 --> 06:44:15,
they might receive a fulness of joy.

212
06:44:15,0 --> 06:44:15,0
18

213
06:44:15,0 --> 06:44:15,0
While

214
06:44:15,0 --> 06:44:15,0
this vast

215
06:44:15,0 --> 06:44:15,0


216
06:44:15,0 --> 06:44:15,0
multitude

217
06:44:15,0 --> 06:44:15,0
waited

218
06:44:15,0 --> 06:44:15,0
and

219
06:44:15,0 --> 06:44:15,0


220
06:44:15,0 --> 06:44:15,0
conversed,

221
06:44:15,0 --> 06:44:15,0
rejoicing

222
06:44:15,0 --> 06:44:15,0
in

223
06:44:15,0 --> 06:44:15,0
