01:24:29,0 --> 01:24:29,0
Higbee: What is

40
01:24:29,0 --> 01:37:32,
meant by the command in

01:37:32,0 --> 01:37:32,0

01:37:32,0 --> 01:37:32,0
to those whom God

43
01:37:32,0 --> 01:37:32,0
should call in the

44
01:37:32,0 --> 01:37:32,0
last days, who

45
01:37:32,0 --> 01:37:32,0
should hold the power of

46
01:37:32,0 --> 01:37:32,0
priesthood to

47
01:37:32,0 --> 01:37:32,0
bring again Zion, and

48
01:37:32,0 --> 01:37:32,0
the redemption of

49
01:37:32,0 --> 01:37:32,0
Israel; and to put on

01:37:32,0 --> 01:37:32,0
her strength is to

51
01:37:32,0 --> 01:37:32,0
put on the

52
01:37:32,0 --> 01:37:32,0
authority of the

53
01:37:32,0 --> 01:37:32,0
priesthood, which she, Zion,

54
01:37:32,0 --> 01:37:32,0
has a right to by

55
01:37:32,0 --> 01:37:32,0
lineage; also to

56
01:37:32,0 --> 01:37:32,0
return to that power

57

01:51:44,0 --> 01:51:44,0
have fallen;

01:51:44,0 --> 01:51:44,0
which if they do,

72
01:51:44,0 --> 01:51:44,0
