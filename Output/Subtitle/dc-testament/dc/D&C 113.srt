15
00:00:58,088 --> 00:01:00,912
 curses of God upon her, or the remnants of Israel

16
00:01:00,912 --> 00:01:03,736
 in their scattered condition among the Gentiles.

17
00:01:03,736 --> 00:01:06,56


18
00:01:06,25 --> 00:01:25,25
1 Who is the Stem of Jesse spoken of in the

19
00:01:25,035 --> 00:01:32,035
2 Verily thus saith the Lord: It is Christ

20
00:01:32,309 --> 00:01:48,309
3 What is the rod spoken of in the

21
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:57,109
4 Behold, thus saith the Lord: It is a servant in

22
00:01:57,109 --> 00:02:05,359
 the hands of Christ, who is partly a descendant of

23
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:13,609
 Jesse as well as of Ephraim, or of the house of

24
00:02:13,609 --> 00:02:21,859
 Joseph, on whom there is laid much power

25
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:36,391
5 What is the root of Jesse spoken of in the

26
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:43,457
6 Behold, thus saith the Lord, it is a descendant

27
00:02:43,457 --> 00:02:50,256
 of Jesse, as well as of Joseph, unto whom rightly

28
00:02:50,256 --> 00:02:57,056
 belongs the priesthood, and the keys of the

29
00:02:57,056 --> 00:03:03,856
 kingdom, for an ensign, and for the gathering of my

30
00:03:03,856 --> 00:03:10,656
 people in the last days

31
00:03:10,69 --> 00:03:28,69
7 Questions by Elias Higbee: What is meant by the

32
00:03:28,69 --> 00:03:46,69
 command in

33
00:03:46,96 --> 00:03:52,817
8 He had reference to those whom God should call

34
00:03:52,817 --> 00:03:58,674
 in the last days, who should hold the power of

35
00:03:58,674 --> 00:04:04,531
 priesthood to bring again Zion, and the redemption of

36
00:04:04,531 --> 00:04:10,388
 Israel; and to put on her strength is to put on

37
00:04:10,388 --> 00:04:16,245
 the authority of the priesthood, which she, Zion,

38
00:04:16,245 --> 00:04:22,102
 has a right to by lineage; also to return to that

39
00:04:22,102 --> 00:04:27,959
 power which she had lost

40
00:04:27,951 --> 00:04:36,951
9 What are we to understand by Zion loosing

41
00:04:36,951 --> 00:04:45,951
 herself from the bands of her neck;

42
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:48,519
10 We are to understand that the scattered

43
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:51,319
 remnants are exhorted to return to the Lord from whence

44
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:54,119
 they have fallen; which if they do, the promise of

45
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:56,919
 the Lord is that he will speak to them, or give

46
00:04:56,919 --> 00:04:59,719
 them revelation. See the
