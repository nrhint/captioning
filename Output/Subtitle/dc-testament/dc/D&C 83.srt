00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 83 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Prophet, at Independence, Missouri, April

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
30, 1832. This revelation was received as the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Prophet sat in council with his brethren. 
1–4,

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Women and children have claim upon their husbands

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and fathers for their support; 
5–6, Widows and

7
00:00:00,0 --> 01:06:54,
orphans have claim upon the Church for their support. 

8
01:06:54,0 --> 01:06:54,0
1 Verily, thus saith the Lord, in addition

9
01:06:54,0 --> 01:06:54,0
to the laws of the church concerning women

10
01:06:54,0 --> 01:06:54,0
and children, those who belong to the

11
01:06:54,0 --> 01:27:29,
church, who have lost their husbands or fathers:

12
01:27:29,0 --> 01:27:29,0
2 Women have claim on their

13
01:27:29,0 --> 01:27:29,0
husbands for their maintenance, until

14
01:27:29,0 --> 01:27:29,0
their husbands are taken; and if

15
01:27:29,0 --> 01:27:29,0
they are not found transgressors they

16
01:27:29,0 --> 01:47:06,
shall have fellowship in the church.

17
01:47:06,0 --> 01:47:06,0
3 And if they are not faithful

18
01:47:06,0 --> 01:47:06,0
they shall not have fellowship

19
01:47:06,0 --> 01:47:06,0
in the church; yet they may

20
01:47:06,0 --> 01:47:06,0
remain upon their inheritances

21
01:47:06,0 --> 02:02:08,
according to the laws of the land.

22
02:02:08,0 --> 02:02:08,0
4 All children have claim

23
02:02:08,0 --> 02:02:08,0
upon their parents for their

24
02:02:08,0 --> 02:15:12,
maintenance until they are of age.

25
02:15:12,0 --> 02:15:12,0
5 And after that, they

26
02:15:12,0 --> 02:15:12,0
have claim upon the church,

27
02:15:12,0 --> 02:15:12,0
or in other words upon the

28
02:15:12,0 --> 02:15:12,0
Lord’s storehouse, if

29
02:15:12,0 --> 02:15:12,0
their parents have not

30
02:15:12,0 --> 02:22:14,
wherewith to give them inheritances.

31
02:22:14,0 --> 02:22:14,0
6 And the storehouse

32
02:22:14,0 --> 02:22:14,0
shall be kept by the

33
02:22:14,0 --> 02:22:14,0
consecrations of the

34
02:22:14,0 --> 02:22:14,0
church; and widows and

35
02:22:14,0 --> 02:22:14,0
orphans shall be provided

36
02:22:14,0 --> 02:31:17,
for, as also the poor. Amen.
