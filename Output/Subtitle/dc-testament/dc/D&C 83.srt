00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:19,278
Section 83 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:27,278
 the Prophet, at Independence, Missouri, April 30,

3
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:35,278
 1832. This revelation was received as the Prophet

4
00:00:35,278 --> 00:00:43,278
 sat in council with his brethren. 
1–4, Women and

5
00:00:43,278 --> 00:00:51,278
 children have claim upon their husbands and fathers

6
00:00:51,278 --> 00:00:59,278
 for their support; 
5–6, Widows and orphans have

7
00:00:59,278 --> 00:01:07,278
 claim upon the Church for their support.

8
00:01:07,217 --> 00:01:12,467
1 Verily, thus saith the Lord, in addition to the

9
00:01:12,467 --> 00:01:17,717
 laws of the church concerning women and children,

10
00:01:17,717 --> 00:01:22,967
 those who belong to the church, who have lost

11
00:01:22,967 --> 00:01:28,217
 their husbands or fathers

12
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:32,971
2 Women have claim on their husbands for their

13
00:01:32,971 --> 00:01:37,721
 maintenance, until their husbands are taken; and if

14
00:01:37,721 --> 00:01:42,471
 they are not found transgressors they shall have

15
00:01:42,471 --> 00:01:47,221
 fellowship in the church

16
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:51,491
3 And if they are not faithful they shall not have

17
00:01:51,491 --> 00:01:55,491
 fellowship in the church; yet they may remain

18
00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:59,491
 upon their inheritances according to the laws of the

19
00:01:59,491 --> 00:02:03,491
 land

20
00:02:03,24 --> 00:02:09,74
4 All children have claim upon their parents for

21
00:02:09,74 --> 00:02:16,24
 their maintenance until they are of age

22
00:02:16,52 --> 00:02:20,52
5 And after that, they have claim upon the church,

23
00:02:20,52 --> 00:02:24,52
 or in other words upon the Lord’s storehouse, if

24
00:02:24,52 --> 00:02:28,52
 their parents have not wherewith to give them

25
00:02:28,52 --> 00:02:32,52
 inheritances

26
00:02:32,502 --> 00:02:40,169
6 And the storehouse shall be kept by the

27
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:47,836
 consecrations of the church; and widows and orphans shall

28
00:02:47,836 --> 00:02:55,503
 be provided for, as also the poor. Amen.
