00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 98 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, August 6, 1833.

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
This revelation came in consequence of the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
persecution upon the Saints in Missouri. Increased

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
settlement of Church members in Missouri troubled some

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
other settlers, who felt threatened by the

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Saints’ numbers, political and economic influence, and

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
cultural and religious differences. In July

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
1833, a mob destroyed Church property, tarred and

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
feathered two Church members, and demanded that the

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Saints leave Jackson County. Although some news

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of the problems in Missouri had no doubt reached

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Prophet in Kirtland (nine hundred miles away),

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the seriousness of the situation could have been

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
known to him at this date only by revelation.

16
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
1–3, The afflictions of the Saints will be for

17
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
their good; 
4–8, The Saints are to befriend the

18
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
constitutional law of the land; 
9–10, Honest, wise,

19
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and good men should be supported for secular

20
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
government; 
11–15, Those who lay down their lives

21
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
in the Lord’s cause will have eternal life;

22
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
16–18, Renounce war and proclaim peace; 
19–22, The

23
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Saints in Kirtland are reproved and commanded to

24
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
repent; 
23–32, The Lord reveals His laws governing

25
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the persecutions and afflictions imposed on His

26
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
people; 
33–38, War is justified only when the

27
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Lord commands it; 
39–48, The Saints are to forgive

28
00:00:00,0 --> 03:42:36,
their enemies, who, if they repent, will also escape the Lord’s vengeance. 

29
03:42:36,0 --> 03:42:36,0
1 Verily I say unto you my friends, fear

30
03:42:36,0 --> 03:42:36,0
not, let your hearts be comforted; yea,

31
03:42:36,0 --> 03:38:16,
rejoice evermore, and in everything give thanks;

32
03:38:16,0 --> 03:38:16,0
2 Waiting patiently on the Lord, for your

33
03:38:16,0 --> 03:38:16,0
prayers have entered into the ears of

34
03:38:16,0 --> 03:38:16,0
the Lord of Sabaoth, and are recorded with

35
03:38:16,0 --> 03:38:16,0
this seal and testament—the Lord hath

36
03:38:16,0 --> 03:43:21,
sworn and decreed that they shall be granted.

37
03:43:21,0 --> 03:43:21,0
3 Therefore, he giveth this promise

38
03:43:21,0 --> 03:43:21,0
unto you, with an immutable covenant

39
03:43:21,0 --> 03:43:21,0
that they shall be fulfilled; and all

40
03:43:21,0 --> 03:43:21,0
things wherewith you have been

41
03:43:21,0 --> 03:43:21,0
afflicted shall work together for your

42
03:43:21,0 --> 03:48:58,
good, and to my name’s glory, saith the Lord.

43
03:48:58,0 --> 03:48:58,0
4 And now, verily I say unto

44
03:48:58,0 --> 03:48:58,0
you concerning the laws of the

45
03:48:58,0 --> 03:48:58,0
land, it is my will that my

46
03:48:58,0 --> 03:48:58,0
people should observe to do all

47
03:48:58,0 --> 03:59:58,
things whatsoever I command them.

48
03:59:58,0 --> 03:59:58,0
5 And that law of the land

49
03:59:58,0 --> 03:59:58,0
which is constitutional,

50
03:59:58,0 --> 03:59:58,0
supporting that principle of freedom

51
03:59:58,0 --> 03:59:58,0
in maintaining rights and

52
03:59:58,0 --> 03:59:58,0
privileges, belongs to all mankind,

53
03:59:58,0 --> 04:09:01,
and is justifiable before me.

54
04:09:01,0 --> 04:09:01,0
6 Therefore, I, the Lord,

55
04:09:01,0 --> 04:09:01,0
justify you, and your

56
04:09:01,0 --> 04:09:01,0
brethren of my church, in

57
04:09:01,0 --> 04:09:01,0
befriending that law which is the

58
04:09:01,0 --> 04:24:03,
constitutional law of the land;

59
04:24:03,0 --> 04:24:03,0
7 And as pertaining to

60
04:24:03,0 --> 04:24:03,0
law of man,

61
04:24:03,0 --> 04:24:03,0
whatsoever is more or less than

62
04:24:03,0 --> 04:50:04,
this, cometh of evil.

63
04:50:04,0 --> 04:50:04,0
8 I, the Lord God,

64
04:50:04,0 --> 04:50:04,0
make you free,

65
04:50:04,0 --> 04:50:04,0
therefore ye are free

66
04:50:04,0 --> 04:50:04,0
indeed; and the law

67
04:50:04,0 --> 04:57:06,
also maketh you free.

68
04:57:06,0 --> 04:57:06,0
9 Nevertheless,

69
04:57:06,0 --> 04:57:06,0
when the wicked rule

70
04:57:06,0 --> 05:04:09,
the people mourn.

71
05:04:09,0 --> 05:04:09,0
10 Wherefore,

72
05:04:09,0 --> 05:04:09,0
honest men and

73
05:04:09,0 --> 05:04:09,0
wise men should be

74
05:04:09,0 --> 05:04:09,0
sought for

75
05:04:09,0 --> 05:04:09,0
diligently, and good

76
05:04:09,0 --> 05:04:09,0
men and wise men

77
05:04:09,0 --> 05:04:09,0
ye should

78
05:04:09,0 --> 05:04:09,0
observe to uphold;

79
05:04:09,0 --> 05:04:09,0
otherwise

80
05:04:09,0 --> 05:04:09,0
whatsoever is less than

81
05:04:09,0 --> 05:08:16,
these cometh of evil.

82
05:08:16,0 --> 05:08:16,0
11 And I give

83
05:08:16,0 --> 05:08:16,0
unto you a

84
05:08:16,0 --> 05:08:16,0
commandment, that ye

85
05:08:16,0 --> 05:08:16,0
shall forsake

86
05:08:16,0 --> 05:08:16,0
all evil and

87
05:08:16,0 --> 05:08:16,0
cleave unto all

88
05:08:16,0 --> 05:08:16,0
good, that ye

89
05:08:16,0 --> 05:08:16,0
shall live by

90
05:08:16,0 --> 05:08:16,0
every word which

91
05:08:16,0 --> 05:08:16,0
proceedeth forth

92
05:08:16,0 --> 05:20:22,
out of the mouth of God.

93
05:20:22,0 --> 05:20:22,0
12 For he will

94
05:20:22,0 --> 05:20:22,0
give unto the

95
05:20:22,0 --> 05:20:22,0
faithful line

96
05:20:22,0 --> 05:20:22,0
upon line,

97
05:20:22,0 --> 05:20:22,0
precept upon

98
05:20:22,0 --> 05:20:22,0
precept; and I

99
05:20:22,0 --> 05:20:22,0
will try you and

100
05:20:22,0 --> 05:21:26,
prove you herewith.

101
05:21:26,0 --> 05:21:26,0
13 And whoso

102
05:21:26,0 --> 05:21:26,0
layeth down

103
05:21:26,0 --> 05:21:26,0
his life in my

104
05:21:26,0 --> 05:21:26,0
cause, for

105
05:21:26,0 --> 05:21:26,0
my name’s

106
05:21:26,0 --> 05:21:26,0
sake, shall find

107
05:21:26,0 --> 05:21:26,0
it again,

108
05:21:26,0 --> 05:36:28,
even life eternal.

109
05:36:28,0 --> 05:36:28,0
14

110
05:36:28,0 --> 05:36:28,0
Therefore, be not

111
05:36:28,0 --> 05:36:28,0
afraid of your

112
05:36:28,0 --> 05:36:28,0
enemies, for

113
05:36:28,0 --> 05:36:28,0
I have

114
05:36:28,0 --> 05:36:28,0
decreed in my

115
05:36:28,0 --> 05:36:28,0
heart, saith

116
05:36:28,0 --> 05:36:28,0
the Lord,

117
05:36:28,0 --> 05:36:28,0
that I will

118
05:36:28,0 --> 05:36:28,0
prove you in

119
05:36:28,0 --> 05:36:28,0
all things,

120
05:36:28,0 --> 05:36:28,0
whether you

121
05:36:28,0 --> 05:36:28,0
will abide in

122
05:36:28,0 --> 05:36:28,0
my covenant,

123
05:36:28,0 --> 05:36:28,0
even unto

124
05:36:28,0 --> 05:36:28,0
death, that

125
05:36:28,0 --> 05:49:32,
you may be found worthy.

126
05:49:32,0 --> 05:49:32,0
15 For if

127
05:49:32,0 --> 05:49:32,0
ye will not

128
05:49:32,0 --> 05:49:32,0
abide in my

129
05:49:32,0 --> 05:49:32,0
covenant

130
05:49:32,0 --> 05:49:32,0
ye are not

131
05:49:32,0 --> 05:56:35,
worthy of me.

132
05:56:35,0 --> 05:56:35,0
16

133
05:56:35,0 --> 05:56:35,0
Therefore,

134
05:56:35,0 --> 05:56:35,0
renounce war and

135
05:56:35,0 --> 05:56:35,0
proclaim

136
05:56:35,0 --> 05:56:35,0
peace, and

137
05:56:35,0 --> 05:56:35,0
seek

138
05:56:35,0 --> 05:56:35,0
diligently to

139
05:56:35,0 --> 05:56:35,0
turn the

140
05:56:35,0 --> 05:56:35,0
hearts of

141
05:56:35,0 --> 05:56:35,0
the

142
05:56:35,0 --> 05:56:35,0
children to their

143
05:56:35,0 --> 05:56:35,0
fathers,

144
05:56:35,0 --> 05:56:35,0
and the

145
05:56:35,0 --> 05:56:35,0
hearts of

146
05:56:35,0 --> 05:56:35,0
the fathers

147
05:56:35,0 --> 06:00:14,
to the children;

148
06:00:14,0 --> 06:00:14,0
17 And

149
06:00:14,0 --> 06:00:14,0
again, the

150
06:00:14,0 --> 06:00:14,0
hearts of

151
06:00:14,0 --> 06:00:14,0
the Jews

152
06:00:14,0 --> 06:00:14,0
unto the

153
06:00:14,0 --> 06:00:14,0


154
06:00:14,0 --> 06:00:14,0
prophets, and the

155
06:00:14,0 --> 06:00:14,0
prophets

156
06:00:14,0 --> 06:00:14,0
unto the

157
06:00:14,0 --> 06:00:14,0
Jews;

158
06:00:14,0 --> 06:00:14,0
lest I come

159
06:00:14,0 --> 06:00:14,0
and

160
06:00:14,0 --> 06:00:14,0
smite the

161
06:00:14,0 --> 06:00:14,0
whole earth

162
06:00:14,0 --> 06:00:14,0
with a

163
06:00:14,0 --> 06:00:14,0
curse, and

164
06:00:14,0 --> 06:00:14,0
all flesh

165
06:00:14,0 --> 06:09:17,
be consumed before me.

166
06:09:17,0 --> 06:09:17,0
18 Let

167
06:09:17,0 --> 06:09:17,0
not your

168
06:09:17,0 --> 06:09:17,0
hearts

169
06:09:17,0 --> 06:09:17,0
be

170
06:09:17,0 --> 06:09:17,0
troubled; for

171
06:09:17,0 --> 06:09:17,0
in my

172
06:09:17,0 --> 06:09:17,0
Father’s

173
06:09:17,0 --> 06:09:17,0
house are

174
06:09:17,0 --> 06:09:17,0
many

175
06:09:17,0 --> 06:09:17,0
mansions,

176
06:09:17,0 --> 06:09:17,0
and I

177
06:09:17,0 --> 06:09:17,0
have

178
06:09:17,0 --> 06:09:17,0
prepared a

179
06:09:17,0 --> 06:09:17,0
place for

180
06:09:17,0 --> 06:09:17,0
you; and

181
06:09:17,0 --> 06:09:17,0
where

182
06:09:17,0 --> 06:09:17,0
my Father

183
06:09:17,0 --> 06:09:17,0
and I

184
06:09:17,0 --> 06:28:54,
am, there ye shall be also.

185
06:28:54,0 --> 06:28:54,0
19

186
06:28:54,0 --> 06:28:54,0
Behold, I,

187
06:28:54,0 --> 06:28:54,0
the Lord,

188
06:28:54,0 --> 06:28:54,0
am not

189
06:28:54,0 --> 06:28:54,0
well

190
06:28:54,0 --> 06:28:54,0
pleased with

191
06:28:54,0 --> 06:28:54,0
many

192
06:28:54,0 --> 06:28:54,0
who are in

193
06:28:54,0 --> 06:28:54,0
the

194
06:28:54,0 --> 06:28:54,0
church at

195
06:28:54,0 --> 06:47:53,
Kirtland;

196
06:47:53,0 --> 06:47:53,0
20 For

197
06:47:53,0 --> 06:47:53,0
they do

198
06:47:53,0 --> 06:47:53,0
not

199
06:47:53,0 --> 06:47:53,0
forsake their

200
06:47:53,0 --> 06:47:53,0
sins,

201
06:47:53,0 --> 06:47:53,0
and their

202
06:47:53,0 --> 06:47:53,0
wicked

203
06:47:53,0 --> 06:47:53,0
ways,

204
06:47:53,0 --> 06:47:53,0
the pride

205
06:47:53,0 --> 06:47:53,0
of their

206
06:47:53,0 --> 06:47:53,0
hearts,

207
06:47:53,0 --> 06:47:53,0
and

208
06:47:53,0 --> 06:47:53,0
their

209
06:47:53,0 --> 06:47:53,0
covetousness,

210
06:47:53,0 --> 06:47:53,0
and all

211
06:47:53,0 --> 06:47:53,0
their

212
06:47:53,0 --> 06:47:53,0


213
06:47:53,0 --> 06:47:53,0
detestable

214
06:47:53,0 --> 06:47:53,0
things, and

215
06:47:53,0 --> 06:47:53,0
observe

216
06:47:53,0 --> 06:47:53,0
the words

217
06:47:53,0 --> 06:47:53,0
of

218
06:47:53,0 --> 06:47:53,0
wisdom and

219
06:47:53,0 --> 06:47:53,0
eternal

220
06:47:53,0 --> 06:47:53,0
