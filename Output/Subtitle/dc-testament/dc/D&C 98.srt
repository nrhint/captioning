1
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:18,885
Section 98 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:26,492
 the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, August 6, 1833.

3
00:00:26,492 --> 00:00:34,099
 This revelation came in consequence of the

4
00:00:34,099 --> 00:00:41,706
 persecution upon the Saints in Missouri. Increased

5
00:00:41,706 --> 00:00:49,313
 settlement of Church members in Missouri troubled some

6
00:00:49,313 --> 00:00:56,92
 other settlers, who felt threatened by the Saints’

7
00:00:56,92 --> 00:01:04,527
 numbers, political and economic influence, and

8
00:01:04,527 --> 00:01:12,134
 cultural and religious differences. In July 1833, a mob

9
00:01:12,134 --> 00:01:19,741
 destroyed Church property, tarred and feathered

10
00:01:19,741 --> 00:01:27,348
 two Church members, and demanded that the Saints

11
00:01:27,348 --> 00:01:34,955
 leave Jackson County. Although some news of the

12
00:01:34,955 --> 00:01:42,562
 problems in Missouri had no doubt reached the Prophet

13
00:01:42,562 --> 00:01:50,169
 in Kirtland (nine hundred miles away), the

14
00:01:50,169 --> 00:01:57,776
 seriousness of the situation could have been known to him

15
00:01:57,776 --> 00:02:05,383
 at this date only by revelation. 
1–3, The

16
00:02:05,383 --> 00:02:12,99
 afflictions of the Saints will be for their good; 
4–8,

17
00:02:12,99 --> 00:02:20,597
 The Saints are to befriend the constitutional law

18
00:02:20,597 --> 00:02:28,204
 of the land; 
9–10, Honest, wise, and good men

19
00:02:28,204 --> 00:02:35,811
 should be supported for secular government; 
11–15,

20
00:02:35,811 --> 00:02:43,418
 Those who lay down their lives in the Lord’s cause

21
00:02:43,418 --> 00:02:51,025
 will have eternal life; 
16–18, Renounce war and

22
00:02:51,025 --> 00:02:58,632
 proclaim peace; 
19–22, The Saints in Kirtland are

23
00:02:58,632 --> 00:03:06,239
 reproved and commanded to repent; 
23–32, The Lord

24
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:13,846
 reveals His laws governing the persecutions and

25
00:03:13,846 --> 00:03:21,453
 afflictions imposed on His people; 
33–38, War is

26
00:03:21,453 --> 00:03:29,06
 justified only when the Lord commands it; 
39–48,

27
00:03:29,06 --> 00:03:36,667
 The Saints are to forgive their enemies, who, if

28
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:44,274
 they repent, will also escape the Lord’s vengeance.

29
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:49,891
1 Verily I say unto you my friends, fear not, let

30
00:03:49,891 --> 00:03:55,224
 your hearts be comforted; yea, rejoice evermore,

31
00:03:55,224 --> 00:04:00,557
 and in everything give thanks

32
00:04:00,54 --> 00:04:05,54
2 Waiting patiently on the Lord, for your prayers

33
00:04:05,54 --> 00:04:10,54
 have entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth,

34
00:04:10,54 --> 00:04:15,54
 and are recorded with this seal and testament—the

35
00:04:15,54 --> 00:04:20,54
 Lord hath sworn and decreed that they shall be

36
00:04:20,54 --> 00:04:25,54
 granted

37
00:04:25,549 --> 00:04:30,749
3 Therefore, he giveth this promise unto you, with

38
00:04:30,749 --> 00:04:35,949
 an immutable covenant that they shall be

39
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:41,149
 fulfilled; and all things wherewith you have been

40
00:04:41,149 --> 00:04:46,349
 afflicted shall work together for your good, and to my

41
00:04:46,349 --> 00:04:51,549
 name’s glory, saith the Lord

42
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:54,307
4 And now, verily I say unto you concerning the

43
00:04:54,307 --> 00:04:57,557
 laws of the land, it is my will that my people

44
00:04:57,557 --> 00:05:00,807
 should observe to do all things whatsoever I command

45
00:05:00,807 --> 00:05:04,057
 them

46
00:05:04,821 --> 00:05:09,571
5 And that law of the land which is

47
00:05:09,571 --> 00:05:14,321
 constitutional, supporting that principle of freedom in

48
00:05:14,321 --> 00:05:19,071
 maintaining rights and privileges, belongs to all mankind,

49
00:05:19,071 --> 00:05:23,821
 and is justifiable before me

50
00:05:23,106 --> 00:05:28,106
6 Therefore, I, the Lord, justify you, and your

51
00:05:28,106 --> 00:05:33,106
 brethren of my church, in befriending that law which

52
00:05:33,106 --> 00:05:38,106
 is the constitutional law of the land

53
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:44,104
7 And as pertaining to law of man, whatsoever is

54
00:05:44,104 --> 00:05:50,104
 more or less than this, cometh of evil

55
00:05:50,1 --> 00:05:55,6
8 I, the Lord God, make you free, therefore ye are

56
00:05:55,6 --> 00:06:01,1
 free indeed; and the law also maketh you free

57
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:06,111
9 Nevertheless, when the wicked rule the people

58
00:06:06,111 --> 00:06:11,111
 mourn

59
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:15,621
10 Wherefore, honest men and wise men should be

60
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:20,121
 sought for diligently, and good men and wise men ye

61
00:06:20,121 --> 00:06:24,621
 should observe to uphold; otherwise whatsoever is

62
00:06:24,621 --> 00:06:29,121
 less than these cometh of evil

63
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:34,639
11 And I give unto you a commandment, that ye

64
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,389
 shall forsake all evil and cleave unto all good, that

65
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:44,139
 ye shall live by every word which proceedeth forth

66
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:48,889
 out of the mouth of God

67
00:06:48,892 --> 00:06:53,225
12 For he will give unto the faithful line upon

68
00:06:53,225 --> 00:06:57,558
 line, precept upon precept; and I will try you and

69
00:06:57,558 --> 00:07:01,891
 prove you herewith

70
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:06,754
13 And whoso layeth down his life in my cause, for

71
00:07:06,754 --> 00:07:12,087
 my name’s sake, shall find it again, even life

72
00:07:12,087 --> 00:07:17,42
 eternal

73
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:22,404
14 Therefore, be not afraid of your enemies, for I

74
00:07:22,404 --> 00:07:27,404
 have decreed in my heart, saith the Lord, that I

75
00:07:27,404 --> 00:07:32,404
 will prove you in all things, whether you will

76
00:07:32,404 --> 00:07:37,404
 abide in my covenant, even unto death, that you may

77
00:07:37,404 --> 00:07:42,404
 be found worthy

78
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:47,479
15 For if ye will not abide in my covenant ye are

79
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:51,979
 not worthy of me

80
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:55,254
16 Therefore, renounce war and proclaim peace, and

81
00:07:55,254 --> 00:07:59,504
 seek diligently to turn the hearts of the

82
00:07:59,504 --> 00:08:03,754
 children to their fathers, and the hearts of the fathers

83
00:08:03,754 --> 00:08:08,004
 to the children

84
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:13,788
17 And again, the hearts of the Jews unto the

85
00:08:13,788 --> 00:08:19,288
 prophets, and the prophets unto the Jews; lest I come

86
00:08:19,288 --> 00:08:24,788
 and smite the whole earth with a curse, and all

87
00:08:24,788 --> 00:08:30,288
 flesh be consumed before me

88
00:08:30,56 --> 00:08:36,56
18 Let not your hearts be troubled; for in my

89
00:08:36,56 --> 00:08:42,56
 Father’s house are many mansions, and I have prepared

90
00:08:42,56 --> 00:08:48,56
 a place for you; and where my Father and I am,

91
00:08:48,56 --> 00:08:54,56
 there ye shall be also

92
00:08:54,05 --> 00:08:59,05
19 Behold, I, the Lord, am not well pleased with

93
00:08:59,05 --> 00:09:04,05
 many who are in the church at Kirtland

94
00:09:04,06 --> 00:09:09,46
20 For they do not forsake their sins, and their

95
00:09:09,46 --> 00:09:14,86
 wicked ways, the pride of their hearts, and their

96
00:09:14,86 --> 00:09:20,26
 covetousness, and all their detestable things, and

97
00:09:20,26 --> 00:09:25,66
 observe the words of wisdom and eternal life which

98
00:09:25,66 --> 00:09:31,06
 I have given unto them

99
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:34,821
21 Verily I say unto you, that I, the Lord, will

100
00:09:34,821 --> 00:09:38,321
 chasten them and will do whatsoever I list, if they

101
00:09:38,321 --> 00:09:41,821
 do not repent and observe all things whatsoever I

102
00:09:41,821 --> 00:09:45,321
 have said unto them

103
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:51,085
22 And again I say unto you, if ye observe to do

104
00:09:51,085 --> 00:09:56,335
 whatsoever I command you, I, the Lord, will turn

105
00:09:56,335 --> 00:10:01,585
 away all wrath and indignation from you, and the

106
00:10:01,585 --> 00:10:06,835
 gates of hell shall not prevail against you

107
00:10:06,122 --> 00:10:11,872
23 Now, I speak unto you concerning your

108
00:10:11,872 --> 00:10:17,622
 families—if men will smite you, or your families, once, and

109
00:10:17,622 --> 00:10:23,372
 ye bear it patiently and revile not against them,

110
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:29,122
 neither seek revenge, ye shall be rewarded

111
00:10:29,112 --> 00:10:34,112
24 But if ye bear it not patiently, it shall be

112
00:10:34,112 --> 00:10:39,112
 accounted unto you as being meted out as a just

113
00:10:39,112 --> 00:10:44,112
 measure unto you

114
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:48,611
25 And again, if your enemy shall smite you the

115
00:10:48,611 --> 00:10:52,611
 second time, and you revile not against your enemy,

116
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:56,611
 and bear it patiently, your reward shall be an

117
00:10:56,611 --> 00:11:00,611
 hundred-fold

118
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:05,926
26 And again, if he shall smite you the third

119
00:11:05,926 --> 00:11:11,259
 time, and ye bear it patiently, your reward shall be

120
00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:16,592
 doubled unto you four-fold

121
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:21,092
27 And these three testimonies shall stand against

122
00:11:21,092 --> 00:11:26,092
 your enemy if he repent not, and shall not be

123
00:11:26,092 --> 00:11:31,092
 blotted out

124
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:35,591
28 And now, verily I say unto you, if that enemy

125
00:11:35,591 --> 00:11:39,591
 shall escape my vengeance, that he be not brought

126
00:11:39,591 --> 00:11:43,591
 into judgment before me, then ye shall see to it

127
00:11:43,591 --> 00:11:47,591
 that ye warn him in my name, that he come no more

128
00:11:47,591 --> 00:11:51,591
 upon you, neither upon your family, even your

129
00:11:51,591 --> 00:11:55,591
 children’s children unto the third and fourth

130
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:59,591
 generation

131
00:11:59,869 --> 00:12:04,369
29 And then, if he shall come upon you or your

132
00:12:04,369 --> 00:12:08,869
 children, or your children’s children unto the third

133
00:12:08,869 --> 00:12:13,369
 and fourth generation, I have delivered thine

134
00:12:13,369 --> 00:12:17,869
 enemy into thine hands

135
00:12:17,87 --> 00:12:22,12
30 And then if thou wilt spare him, thou shalt be

136
00:12:22,12 --> 00:12:26,37
 rewarded for thy righteousness; and also thy

137
00:12:26,37 --> 00:12:30,62
 children and thy children’s children unto the third and

138
00:12:30,62 --> 00:12:34,87
 fourth generation

139
00:12:34,404 --> 00:12:40,004
31 Nevertheless, thine enemy is in thine hands;

140
00:12:40,004 --> 00:12:45,604
 and if thou rewardest him according to his works

141
00:12:45,604 --> 00:12:51,204
 thou art justified; if he has sought thy life, and

142
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:56,804
 thy life is endangered by him, thine enemy is in

143
00:12:56,804 --> 00:13:02,404
 thine hands and thou art justified

144
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:07,632
32 Behold, this is the law I gave unto my servant

145
00:13:07,632 --> 00:13:12,882
 Nephi, and thy fathers, Joseph, and Jacob, and

146
00:13:12,882 --> 00:13:18,132
 Isaac, and Abraham, and all mine ancient prophets and

147
00:13:18,132 --> 00:13:23,382
 apostles

148
00:13:23,653 --> 00:13:28,403
33 And again, this is the law that I gave unto

149
00:13:28,403 --> 00:13:33,153
 mine ancients, that they should not go out unto

150
00:13:33,153 --> 00:13:37,903
 battle against any nation, kindred, tongue, or people,

151
00:13:37,903 --> 00:13:42,653
 save I, the Lord, commanded them

152
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:46,155
34 And if any nation, tongue, or people should

153
00:13:46,155 --> 00:13:49,655
 proclaim war against them, they should first lift a

154
00:13:49,655 --> 00:13:53,155
 standard of peace unto that people, nation, or

155
00:13:53,155 --> 00:13:56,655
 tongue

156
00:13:56,652 --> 00:14:00,902
35 And if that people did not accept the offering

157
00:14:00,902 --> 00:14:05,152
 of peace, neither the second nor the third time,

158
00:14:05,152 --> 00:14:09,402
 they should bring these testimonies before the

159
00:14:09,402 --> 00:14:13,652
 Lord

160
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:17,286
36 Then I, the Lord, would give unto them a

161
00:14:17,286 --> 00:14:20,619
 commandment, and justify them in going out to battle

162
00:14:20,619 --> 00:14:23,952
 against that nation, tongue, or people

163
00:14:23,98 --> 00:14:27,58
37 And I, the Lord, would fight their battles, and

164
00:14:27,58 --> 00:14:31,18
 their children’s battles, and their children’s

165
00:14:31,18 --> 00:14:34,78
 children’s, until they had avenged themselves on all

166
00:14:34,78 --> 00:14:38,38
 their enemies, to the third and fourth

167
00:14:38,38 --> 00:14:41,98
 generation

168
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:46,314
38 Behold, this is an ensample unto all people,

169
00:14:46,314 --> 00:14:50,647
 saith the Lord your God, for justification before

170
00:14:50,647 --> 00:14:54,98
 me

171
00:14:54,51 --> 00:14:58,51
39 And again, verily I say unto you, if after

172
00:14:58,51 --> 00:15:02,51
 thine enemy has come upon thee the first time, he

173
00:15:02,51 --> 00:15:06,51
 repent and come unto thee praying thy forgiveness,

174
00:15:06,51 --> 00:15:10,51
 thou shalt forgive him, and shalt hold it no more as

175
00:15:10,51 --> 00:15:14,51
 a testimony against thine enemy

176
00:15:14,03 --> 00:15:19,03
40 And so on unto the second and third time; and

177
00:15:19,03 --> 00:15:24,03
 as oft as thine enemy repenteth of the trespass

178
00:15:24,03 --> 00:15:29,03
 wherewith he has trespassed against thee, thou shalt

179
00:15:29,03 --> 00:15:34,03
 forgive him, until seventy times seven

180
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:38,468
41 And if he trespass against thee and repent not

181
00:15:38,468 --> 00:15:42,135
 the first time, nevertheless thou shalt forgive

182
00:15:42,135 --> 00:15:45,802
 him

183
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:48,812
42 And if he trespass against thee the second

184
00:15:48,812 --> 00:15:51,812
 time, and repent not, nevertheless thou shalt forgive

185
00:15:51,812 --> 00:15:54,812
 him

186
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:58,887
43 And if he trespass against thee the third time,

187
00:15:58,887 --> 00:16:03,387
 and repent not, thou shalt also forgive him

188
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:07,512
44 But if he trespass against thee the fourth time

189
00:16:07,512 --> 00:16:11,845
 thou shalt not forgive him, but shalt bring these

190
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:16,178
 testimonies before the Lord; and they shall not

191
00:16:16,178 --> 00:16:20,511
 be blotted out until he repent and reward thee

192
00:16:20,511 --> 00:16:24,844
 four-fold in all things wherewith he has trespassed

193
00:16:24,844 --> 00:16:29,177
 against thee

194
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:34,189
45 And if he do this, thou shalt forgive him with

195
00:16:34,189 --> 00:16:38,689
 all thine heart; and if he do not this, I, the

196
00:16:38,689 --> 00:16:43,189
 Lord, will avenge thee of thine enemy an

197
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:47,689
 hundred-fold

198
00:16:47,99 --> 00:16:52,657
46 And upon his children, and upon his children’s

199
00:16:52,657 --> 00:16:57,324
 children of all them that hate me, unto the third

200
00:16:57,324 --> 00:17:01,991
 and fourth generation

201
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:06,129
47 But if the children shall repent, or the

202
00:17:06,129 --> 00:17:10,504
 children’s children, and turn to the Lord their God,

203
00:17:10,504 --> 00:17:14,879
 with all their hearts and with all their might, mind,

204
00:17:14,879 --> 00:17:19,254
 and strength, and restore four-fold for all their

205
00:17:19,254 --> 00:17:23,629
 trespasses wherewith they have trespassed, or

206
00:17:23,629 --> 00:17:28,004
 wherewith their fathers have trespassed, or their

207
00:17:28,004 --> 00:17:32,379
 fathers’ fathers, then thine indignation shall be

208
00:17:32,379 --> 00:17:36,754
 turned away

209
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:40,505
48 And vengeance shall no more come upon them,

210
00:17:40,505 --> 00:17:44,755
 saith the Lord thy God, and their trespasses shall

211
00:17:44,755 --> 00:17:49,005
 never be brought any more as a testimony before the

212
00:17:49,005 --> 00:17:53,255
 Lord against them. Amen.
