1â€“4, Jared Carter is

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:40:59,
called to preach the gospel by the Comforter. 

5
00:40:59,0 --> 00:40:59,0
1 Verily I say unto you, that it is

6
00:40:59,0 --> 00:40:59,0
my will that my servant Jared Carter

7
00:40:59,0 --> 00:40:59,0
should go again into the eastern

8
00:40:59,0 --> 00:40:59,0
countries, from place to place, and

9
00:40:59,0 --> 00:40:59,0
from city to city, in the power of the

10
00:40:59,0 --> 00:40:59,0
ordination wherewith he has been

11
00:40:59,0 --> 00:40:59,0
ordained, proclaiming glad tidings of

12
00:40:59,0 --> 01:13:59,
great joy, even the everlasting gospel.

13
01:13:59,0 --> 01:13:59,0
2 And I will send upon him the

14
01:13:59,0 --> 01:13:59,0
Comforter, which shall teach him the

15
01:13:59,0 --> 01:23:02,
truth and the way whither he shall go;

16
01:23:02,0 --> 01:23:02,0
3 And inasmuch as he is faithful, I

17
01:23:02,0 --> 01:37:06,
will crown him again with sheaves.

18
01:37:06,0 --> 01:37:06,0
4 Wherefore, let your heart

19
01:37:06,0 --> 01:37:06,0
be glad, my servant Jared

20
01:37:06,0 --> 01:37:06,0
Carter, and fear not, saith your

21
01:37:06,0 --> 01:52:08,
Lord, even Jesus Christ. Amen.
