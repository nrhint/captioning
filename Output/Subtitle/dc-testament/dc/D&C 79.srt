00:00:20,514 --> 00:00:27,514
 the Prophet, at Hiram, Ohio, March 12, 1832. 
1â€“4,

00:00:27,514 --> 00:00:34,514
 Jared Carter is called to preach the gospel by the

4
00:00:34,514 --> 00:00:41,514
 Comforter.

5
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:47,475
1 Verily I say unto you, that it is my will that

6
00:00:47,475 --> 00:00:52,975
 my servant Jared Carter should go again into the

7
00:00:52,975 --> 00:00:58,475
 eastern countries, from place to place, and from

8
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:03,975
 city to city, in the power of the ordination

9
00:01:03,975 --> 00:01:09,475
 wherewith he has been ordained, proclaiming glad tidings

10
00:01:09,475 --> 00:01:14,975
 of great joy, even the everlasting gospel

11
00:01:14,524 --> 00:01:17,857
2 And I will send upon him the Comforter, which

12
00:01:17,857 --> 00:01:21,19
 shall teach him the truth and the way whither he

13
00:01:21,19 --> 00:01:24,523
 shall go

14
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:31,301
3 And inasmuch as he is faithful, I will crown him

15
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:38,301
 again with sheaves

16
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:40,065
4 Wherefore, let your heart be glad, my servant

17
00:01:40,065 --> 00:01:42,065
 Jared Carter, and fear not, saith your Lord, even

18
00:01:42,065 --> 00:01:44,065
 Jesus Christ. Amen.
