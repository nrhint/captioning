00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:18,078
Section 91 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:18,078 --> 00:00:24,878
 the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, March 9, 1833. The

3
00:00:24,878 --> 00:00:31,678
 Prophet was at this time engaged in the

4
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:38,478
 translation of the Old Testament. Having come to that

5
00:00:38,478 --> 00:00:45,278
 portion of the ancient writings called the Apocrypha, he

6
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:52,078
 inquired of the Lord and received this

7
00:00:52,078 --> 00:00:58,878
 instruction. 
1–3, The Apocrypha is mostly translated

8
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:05,678
 correctly but contains many interpolations by the hands

9
00:01:05,678 --> 00:01:12,478
 of men that are not true; 
4–6, It benefits those

10
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:19,278
 enlightened by the Spirit.

11
00:01:19,68 --> 00:01:23,43
1 Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you concerning

12
00:01:23,43 --> 00:01:27,18
 the Apocrypha—There are many things contained

13
00:01:27,18 --> 00:01:30,93
 therein that are true, and it is mostly translated

14
00:01:30,93 --> 00:01:34,68
 correctly

15
00:01:34,444 --> 00:01:37,111
2 There are many things contained therein that are

16
00:01:37,111 --> 00:01:39,778
 not true, which are interpolations by the hands

17
00:01:39,778 --> 00:01:42,445
 of men

18
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:46,436
3 Verily, I say unto you, that it is not needful

19
00:01:46,436 --> 00:01:50,436
 that the Apocrypha should be translated

20
00:01:50,427 --> 00:01:54,927
4 Therefore, whoso readeth it, let him understand,

21
00:01:54,927 --> 00:01:59,427
 for the Spirit manifesteth truth

22
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:02,719
5 And whoso is enlightened by the Spirit shall

23
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,219
 obtain benefit therefrom

24
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:10,226
6 And whoso receiveth not by the Spirit, cannot be

25
00:02:10,226 --> 00:02:14,226
 benefited. Therefore it is not needful that it

26
00:02:14,226 --> 00:02:18,226
 should be translated. Amen.
