00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 91 Revelation given through Joseph

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, March 9,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
1833. The Prophet was at this time engaged in the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
translation of the Old Testament. Having come to

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
that portion of the ancient writings called

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Apocrypha, he inquired of the Lord and

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
received this instruction. 
1–3, The Apocrypha is

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
mostly translated correctly but contains many

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
interpolations by the hands of men that are not

10
00:00:00,0 --> 01:18:54,
true; 
4–6, It benefits those enlightened by the Spirit. 

11
01:18:54,0 --> 01:18:54,0
1 Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you

12
01:18:54,0 --> 01:18:54,0
concerning the Apocrypha—There are many

13
01:18:54,0 --> 01:18:54,0
things contained therein that are

14
01:18:54,0 --> 01:23:59,
true, and it is mostly translated correctly;

15
01:23:59,0 --> 01:23:59,0
2 There are many things contained

16
01:23:59,0 --> 01:23:59,0
therein that are not true, which are

17
01:23:59,0 --> 01:23:37,
interpolations by the hands of men.

18
01:23:37,0 --> 01:23:37,0
3 Verily, I say unto you,

19
01:23:37,0 --> 01:23:37,0
that it is not needful that the

20
01:23:37,0 --> 01:19:17,
Apocrypha should be translated.

21
01:19:17,0 --> 01:19:17,0
4 Therefore, whoso readeth

22
01:19:17,0 --> 01:19:17,0
it, let him understand, for

23
01:19:17,0 --> 01:23:24,
the Spirit manifesteth truth;

24
01:23:24,0 --> 01:23:24,0
5 And whoso is

25
01:23:24,0 --> 01:23:24,0
enlightened by the Spirit shall

26
01:23:24,0 --> 01:19:04,
obtain benefit therefrom;

27
01:19:04,0 --> 01:19:04,0
6 And whoso receiveth

28
01:19:04,0 --> 01:19:04,0
not by the Spirit,

29
01:19:04,0 --> 01:19:04,0
cannot be benefited.

30
01:19:04,0 --> 01:19:04,0
Therefore it is not

31
01:19:04,0 --> 01:19:04,0
needful that it should

32
01:19:04,0 --> 01:23:41,
be translated. Amen.
