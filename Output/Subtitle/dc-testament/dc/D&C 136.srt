 for the westward journey is explained; 
17–27,

 pray, and learn wisdom; 
34–42, Prophets are slain

00:01:20,002 --> 00:01:27,638

11
00:01:27,638 --> 00:01:35,274
 condemned.

12
00:01:35,412 --> 00:01:40,912

13
00:01:40,912 --> 00:01:46,412
 Camp of Israel in their journeyings to the West

14
00:01:46,923 --> 00:01:52,123
2 Let all the people of The Church of Jesus Christ

15
00:01:52,123 --> 00:01:57,323
 of Latter-day Saints, and those who journey with

16
00:01:57,323 --> 00:02:02,523
 them, be organized into companies, with a covenant

17
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:07,723
 and promise to keep all the commandments and

18
00:02:07,723 --> 00:02:12,923
 statutes of the Lord our God

19
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:24,516
3 Let the companies be organized with captains of

20
00:02:24,516 --> 00:02:36,116
 hundreds, captains of fifties, and captains of

21
00:02:36,116 --> 00:02:47,716
 tens, with a president and his two counselors at

22
00:02:47,716 --> 00:02:59,316
 their head, under the direction of the Twelve

23
00:02:59,316 --> 00:03:10,916
 Apostles

24
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:14,157
4 And this shall be our covenant—that we will walk

25
00:03:14,157 --> 00:03:18,157
 in all the ordinances of the Lord

26
00:03:18,482 --> 00:03:24,482
5 Let each company provide themselves with all the

27
00:03:24,482 --> 00:03:30,482
 teams, wagons, provisions, clothing, and other

28
00:03:30,482 --> 00:03:36,482
 necessaries for the journey, that they can

29
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:43,116
6 When the companies are organized let them go to

30
00:03:43,116 --> 00:03:49,449
 with their might, to prepare for those who are to

31
00:03:49,449 --> 00:03:55,782
 tarry

32
00:03:55,302 --> 00:04:02,635
7 Let each company, with their captains and

33
00:04:02,635 --> 00:04:09,968
 presidents, decide how many can go next spring; then

34
00:04:09,968 --> 00:04:17,301
 choose out a sufficient number of able-bodied and

35
00:04:17,301 --> 00:04:24,634
 expert men, to take teams, seeds, and farming

36
00:04:24,634 --> 00:04:31,967
 utensils, to go as pioneers to prepare for putting in

37
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:39,3
 spring crops

38
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:47,346
8 Let each company bear an equal proportion,

39
00:04:47,346 --> 00:04:54,846
 according to the dividend of their property, in taking

40
00:04:54,846 --> 00:05:02,346
 the poor, the widows, the fatherless, and the

41
00:05:02,346 --> 00:05:09,846
 families of those who have gone into the army, that

42
00:05:09,846 --> 00:05:17,346
 the cries of the widow and the fatherless come not

43
00:05:17,346 --> 00:05:24,846
 up into the ears of the Lord against this people

44
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:30,108
9 Let each company prepare houses, and fields for

45
00:05:30,108 --> 00:05:35,358
 raising grain, for those who are to remain behind

46
00:05:35,358 --> 00:05:40,608
 this season; and this is the will of the Lord

47
00:05:40,608 --> 00:05:45,858
 concerning his people

48
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:52,045
10 Let every man use all his influence and

49
00:05:52,045 --> 00:05:58,712
 property to remove this people to the place where the

50
00:05:58,712 --> 00:06:05,379
 Lord shall locate a stake of Zion

51
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:10,881
11 And if ye do this with a pure heart, in all

52
00:06:10,881 --> 00:06:16,631
 faithfulness, ye shall be blessed; you shall be

53
00:06:16,631 --> 00:06:22,381
 blessed in your flocks, and in your herds, and in your

54
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:28,131
 fields, and in your houses, and in your families

55
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:36,622
12 Let my servants Ezra T. Benson and Erastus Snow

56
00:06:36,622 --> 00:06:44,622
 organize a company

57
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:50,637
13 And let my servants Orson Pratt and Wilford

58
00:06:50,637 --> 00:06:57,137
 Woodruff organize a company

59
00:06:57,901 --> 00:07:04,901
14 Also, let my servants Amasa Lyman and George A.

60
00:07:04,901 --> 00:07:11,901
 Smith organize a company

61
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:21,198
15 And appoint presidents, and captains of

62
00:07:21,198 --> 00:07:30,698
 hundreds, and of fifties, and of tens

63
00:07:30,467 --> 00:07:37,134
16 And let my servants that have been appointed go

64
00:07:37,134 --> 00:07:43,801
 and teach this, my will, to the saints, that they

65
00:07:43,801 --> 00:07:50,468
 may be ready to go to a land of peace

66
00:07:50,453 --> 00:07:55,453
17 Go thy way and do as I have told you, and fear

67
00:07:55,453 --> 00:08:00,453
 not thine enemies; for they shall not have power

68
00:08:00,453 --> 00:08:05,453
 to stop my work

69
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:12,719
18 Zion shall be redeemed in mine own due time

70
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:16,575
19 And if any man shall seek to build up himself,

71
00:08:16,575 --> 00:08:20,908
 and seeketh not my counsel, he shall have no

72
00:08:20,908 --> 00:08:25,241
 power, and his folly shall be made manifest

73
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:32,255
20 Seek ye; and keep all your pledges one with

74
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:39,255
 another; and covet not that which is thy brother’s

75
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:44,752
21 Keep yourselves from evil to take the name of

76
00:08:44,752 --> 00:08:50,252
 the Lord in vain, for I am the Lord your God, even

77
00:08:50,252 --> 00:08:55,752
 the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham and of

78
00:08:55,752 --> 00:09:01,252
 Isaac and of Jacob

79
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:08,574
22 I am he who led the children of Israel out of

80
00:09:08,574 --> 00:09:15,907
 the land of Egypt; and my arm is stretched out in

81
00:09:15,907 --> 00:09:23,24
 the last days, to save my people Israel

82
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:27,497
23 Cease to contend one with another; cease to

83
00:09:27,497 --> 00:09:30,997
 speak evil one of another

84
00:09:30,52 --> 00:09:34,52
24 Cease drunkenness; and let your words tend to

85
00:09:34,52 --> 00:09:38,52
 edifying one another

86
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:44,328
25 If thou borrowest of thy neighbor, thou shalt

87
00:09:44,328 --> 00:09:49,828
 restore that which thou hast borrowed; and if thou

88
00:09:49,828 --> 00:09:55,328
 canst not repay then go straightway and tell thy

89
00:09:55,328 --> 00:10:00,828
 neighbor, lest he condemn thee

90
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,666
26 If thou shalt find that which thy neighbor has

91
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:06,999
 lost, thou shalt make diligent search till thou

92
00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:10,332
 shalt deliver it to him again

93
00:10:10,86 --> 00:10:15,36
27 Thou shalt be diligent in preserving what thou

94
00:10:15,36 --> 00:10:19,86
 hast, that thou mayest be a wise steward; for it

95
00:10:19,86 --> 00:10:24,36
 is the free gift of the Lord thy God, and thou art

96
00:10:24,36 --> 00:10:28,86
 his steward

97
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:33,195
28 If thou art merry, praise the Lord with

98
00:10:33,195 --> 00:10:37,528
 singing, with music, with dancing, and with a prayer of

99
00:10:37,528 --> 00:10:41,861
 praise and thanksgiving

100
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:45,007
29 If thou art sorrowful, call on the Lord thy God

101
00:10:45,007 --> 00:10:48,34
 with supplication, that your souls may be joyful

102
00:10:48,34 --> 00:10:51,673


103
00:10:51,968 --> 00:10:57,968
30 Fear not thine enemies, for they are in mine

104
00:10:57,968 --> 00:11:03,968
 hands and I will do my pleasure with them

105
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:09,763
31 My people must be tried in all things, that

106
00:11:09,763 --> 00:11:15,563
 they may be prepared to receive the glory that I have

107
00:11:15,563 --> 00:11:21,363
 for them, even the glory of Zion; and he that

108
00:11:21,363 --> 00:11:27,163
 will not bear chastisement is not worthy of my

109
00:11:27,163 --> 00:11:32,963
 kingdom

110
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:38,209
32 Let him that is ignorant learn wisdom by

111
00:11:38,209 --> 00:11:43,459
 humbling himself and calling upon the Lord his God, that

112
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:48,709
 his eyes may be opened that he may see, and his

113
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:53,959
 ears opened that he may hear

114
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:58,579
33 For my Spirit is sent forth into the world to

115
00:11:58,579 --> 00:12:03,912
 enlighten the humble and contrite, and to the

116
00:12:03,912 --> 00:12:09,245
 condemnation of the ungodly

117
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:16,729
34 Thy brethren have rejected you and your

118
00:12:16,729 --> 00:12:24,229
 testimony, even the nation that has driven you out

119
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:30,994
35 And now cometh the day of their calamity, even

120
00:12:30,994 --> 00:12:37,494
 the days of sorrow, like a woman that is taken in

121
00:12:37,494 --> 00:12:43,994
 travail; and their sorrow shall be great unless

122
00:12:43,994 --> 00:12:50,494
 they speedily repent, yea, very speedily

123
00:12:50,286 --> 00:12:57,286
36 For they killed the prophets, and them that

124
00:12:57,286 --> 00:13:04,286
 were sent unto them; and they have shed innocent

125
00:13:04,286 --> 00:13:11,286
 blood, which crieth from the ground against them

126
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:17,991
37 Therefore, marvel not at these things, for ye

127
00:13:17,991 --> 00:13:24,191
 are not yet pure; ye can not yet bear my glory; but

128
00:13:24,191 --> 00:13:30,391
 ye shall behold it if ye are faithful in keeping

129
00:13:30,391 --> 00:13:36,591
 all my words that I have given you, from the days

130
00:13:36,591 --> 00:13:42,791
 of Adam to Abraham, from Abraham to Moses, from

131
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:48,991
 Moses to Jesus and his apostles, and from Jesus and

132
00:13:48,991 --> 00:13:55,191
 his apostles to Joseph Smith, whom I did call upon

133
00:13:55,191 --> 00:14:01,391
 by mine angels, my ministering servants, and by

134
00:14:01,391 --> 00:14:07,591
 mine own voice out of the heavens, to bring forth

135
00:14:07,591 --> 00:14:13,791
 my work

136
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:19,519
38 Which foundation he did lay, and was faithful;

137
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:26,019
 and I took him to myself

138
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:31,032
39 Many have marveled because of his death; but it

139
00:14:31,032 --> 00:14:36,032
 was needful that he should seal his testimony

140
00:14:36,032 --> 00:14:41,032
 with his blood, that he might be honored and the

141
00:14:41,032 --> 00:14:46,032
 wicked might be condemned

142
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:52,552
40 Have I not delivered you from your enemies,

143
00:14:52,552 --> 00:14:58,552
 only in that I have left a witness of my name

144
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:02,064
41 Now, therefore, hearken, O ye people of my

145
00:15:02,064 --> 00:15:06,064
 church; and ye elders listen together; you have

146
00:15:06,064 --> 00:15:10,064
 received my kingdom

147
00:15:10,593 --> 00:15:16,593
42 Be diligent in keeping all my commandments,

148
00:15:16,593 --> 00:15:22,593
 lest judgments come upon you, and your faith fail

149
00:15:22,593 --> 00:15:28,593
 you, and your enemies triumph over you. So no more at

150
00:15:28,593 --> 00:15:34,593
 present. Amen and Amen.
