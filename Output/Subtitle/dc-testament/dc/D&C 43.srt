1
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:18,631
Section 43 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:18,631 --> 00:00:25,984
 the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, in February 1831.

3
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:33,337
 At this time some members of the Church were

4
00:00:33,337 --> 00:00:40,69
 disturbed by people making false claims as revelators.

5
00:00:40,69 --> 00:00:48,043
 The Prophet inquired of the Lord and received this

6
00:00:48,043 --> 00:00:55,396
 communication addressed to the elders of the

7
00:00:55,396 --> 00:01:02,749
 Church. The first part deals with matters of Church

8
00:01:02,749 --> 00:01:10,102
 polity; the latter part contains a warning that the

9
00:01:10,102 --> 00:01:17,455
 elders are to give to the nations of the earth.

10
00:01:17,455 --> 00:01:24,808
1–7, Revelations and commandments come only through

11
00:01:24,808 --> 00:01:32,161
 the one appointed; 
8–14, The Saints are

12
00:01:32,161 --> 00:01:39,514
 sanctified by acting in all holiness before the Lord;

13
00:01:39,514 --> 00:01:46,867
15–22, Elders are sent forth to cry repentance and

14
00:01:46,867 --> 00:01:54,22
 prepare men for the great day of the Lord; 
23–28,

15
00:01:54,22 --> 00:02:01,573
 The Lord calls upon men by His own voice and through

16
00:02:01,573 --> 00:02:08,926
 the forces of nature; 
29–35, The Millennium and

17
00:02:08,926 --> 00:02:16,279
 the binding of Satan will come.

18
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:22,169
1 O hearken, ye elders of my church, and give ear

19
00:02:22,169 --> 00:02:28,169
 to the words which I shall speak unto you

20
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:33,299
2 For behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, that

21
00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:37,899
 ye have received a commandment for a law unto my

22
00:02:37,899 --> 00:02:42,499
 church, through him whom I have appointed unto you

23
00:02:42,499 --> 00:02:47,099
 to receive commandments and revelations from my

24
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:51,699
 hand

25
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:58,455
3 And this ye shall know assuredly—that there is

26
00:02:58,455 --> 00:03:05,205
 none other appointed unto you to receive

27
00:03:05,205 --> 00:03:11,955
 commandments and revelations until he be taken, if he abide

28
00:03:11,955 --> 00:03:18,705
 in me

29
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:23,499
4 But verily, verily, I say unto you, that none

30
00:03:23,499 --> 00:03:28,298
 else shall be appointed unto this gift except it be

31
00:03:28,298 --> 00:03:33,099
 through him; for if it be taken from him he shall

32
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:37,898
 not have power except to appoint another in his

33
00:03:37,898 --> 00:03:42,698
 stead

34
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:48,439
5 And this shall be a law unto you, that ye

35
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:54,439
 receive not the teachings of any that shall come before

36
00:03:54,439 --> 00:04:00,439
 you as revelations or commandments

37
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:05,707
6 And this I give unto you that you may not be

38
00:04:05,707 --> 00:04:11,207
 deceived, that you may know they are not of me

39
00:04:11,968 --> 00:04:19,168
7 For verily I say unto you, that he that is

40
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:26,368
 ordained of me shall come in at the gate and be

41
00:04:26,368 --> 00:04:33,568
 ordained as I have told you before, to teach those

42
00:04:33,568 --> 00:04:40,768
 revelations which you have received and shall receive

43
00:04:40,768 --> 00:04:47,968
 through him whom I have appointed

44
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:52,287
8 And now, behold, I give unto you a commandment,

45
00:04:52,287 --> 00:04:57,12
 that when ye are assembled together ye shall

46
00:04:57,12 --> 00:05:01,953
 instruct and edify each other, that ye may know how to

47
00:05:01,953 --> 00:05:06,786
 act and direct my church, how to act upon the

48
00:05:06,786 --> 00:05:11,619
 points of my law and commandments, which I have given

49
00:05:11,619 --> 00:05:16,452


50
00:05:16,95 --> 00:05:22,45
9 And thus ye shall become instructed in the law

51
00:05:22,45 --> 00:05:27,95
 of my church, and be sanctified by that which ye

52
00:05:27,95 --> 00:05:33,45
 have received, and ye shall bind yourselves to act

53
00:05:33,45 --> 00:05:38,95
 in all holiness before me

54
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:44,689
10 That inasmuch as ye do this, glory shall be

55
00:05:44,689 --> 00:05:50,439
 added to the kingdom which ye have received. Inasmuch

56
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:56,189
 as ye do it not, it shall be taken, even that

57
00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:01,939
 which ye have received

58
00:06:01,211 --> 00:06:06,211
11 Purge ye out the iniquity which is among you;

59
00:06:06,211 --> 00:06:11,211
 sanctify yourselves before me

60
00:06:11,755 --> 00:06:18,422
12 And if ye desire the glories of the kingdom,

61
00:06:18,422 --> 00:06:25,089
 appoint ye my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and uphold

62
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:31,756
 him before me by the prayer of faith

63
00:06:31,741 --> 00:06:38,741
13 And again, I say unto you, that if ye desire

64
00:06:38,741 --> 00:06:45,741
 the mysteries of the kingdom, provide for him food

65
00:06:45,741 --> 00:06:52,741
 and raiment, and whatsoever thing he needeth to

66
00:06:52,741 --> 00:06:59,741
 accomplish the work wherewith I have commanded him

67
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:08,052
14 And if ye do it not he shall remain unto them

68
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:16,385
 that have received him, that I may reserve unto

69
00:07:16,385 --> 00:07:24,718
 myself a pure people before me

70
00:07:24,995 --> 00:07:32,595
15 Again I say, hearken ye elders of my church,

71
00:07:32,595 --> 00:07:40,195
 whom I have appointed: Ye are not sent forth to be

72
00:07:40,195 --> 00:07:47,795
 taught, but to teach the children of men the things

73
00:07:47,795 --> 00:07:55,395
 which I have put into your hands by the power of

74
00:07:55,395 --> 00:08:02,995
 my Spirit

75
00:08:02,966 --> 00:08:09,966
16 And ye are to be taught from on high. Sanctify

76
00:08:09,966 --> 00:08:16,966
 yourselves and ye shall be endowed with power,

77
00:08:16,966 --> 00:08:23,966
 that ye may give even as I have spoken

78
00:08:23,97 --> 00:08:28,47
17 Hearken ye, for, behold, the great day of the

79
00:08:28,47 --> 00:08:32,97
 Lord is nigh at hand

80
00:08:32,996 --> 00:08:40,663
18 For the day cometh that the Lord shall utter

81
00:08:40,663 --> 00:08:48,33
 his voice out of heaven; the heavens shall shake and

82
00:08:48,33 --> 00:08:55,997
 the earth shall tremble, and the trump of God

83
00:08:55,997 --> 00:09:03,664
 shall sound both long and loud, and shall say to the

84
00:09:03,664 --> 00:09:11,331
 sleeping nations: Ye saints arise and live; ye

85
00:09:11,331 --> 00:09:18,998
 sinners stay and sleep until I shall call again

86
00:09:18,007 --> 00:09:25,507
19 Wherefore gird up your loins lest ye be found

87
00:09:25,507 --> 00:09:33,007
 among the wicked

88
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:41,506
20 Lift up your voices and spare not. Call upon

89
00:09:41,506 --> 00:09:50,006
 the nations to repent, both old and young, both bond

90
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:58,506
 and free, saying: Prepare yourselves for the

91
00:09:58,506 --> 00:10:07,006
 great day of the Lord

92
00:10:07,757 --> 00:10:13,424
21 For if I, who am a man, do lift up my voice and

93
00:10:13,424 --> 00:10:19,091
 call upon you to repent, and ye hate me, what

94
00:10:19,091 --> 00:10:24,758
 will ye say when the day cometh when the thunders

95
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:30,425
 shall utter their voices from the ends of the earth,

96
00:10:30,425 --> 00:10:36,092
 speaking to the ears of all that live,

97
00:10:36,092 --> 00:10:41,759
 saying—Repent, and prepare for the great day of the Lord

98
00:10:41,524 --> 00:10:46,691
22 Yea, and again, when the lightnings shall

99
00:10:46,691 --> 00:10:51,858
 streak forth from the east unto the west, and shall

100
00:10:51,858 --> 00:10:57,025
 utter forth their voices unto all that live, and make

101
00:10:57,025 --> 00:11:02,192
 the ears of all tingle that hear, saying these

102
00:11:02,192 --> 00:11:07,359
 words—Repent ye, for the great day of the Lord is

103
00:11:07,359 --> 00:11:12,526
 come

104
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:19,439
23 And again, the Lord shall utter his voice out

105
00:11:19,439 --> 00:11:26,106
 of heaven, saying: Hearken, O ye nations of the

106
00:11:26,106 --> 00:11:32,773
 earth, and hear the words of that God who made you

107
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:40,108
24 O, ye nations of the earth, how often would I

108
00:11:40,108 --> 00:11:47,441
 have gathered you together as a hen gathereth her

109
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:54,774
 chickens under her wings, but ye would not

110
00:11:54,08 --> 00:11:59,83
25 How oft have I called upon you by the mouth of

111
00:11:59,83 --> 00:12:05,58
 my servants, and by the ministering of angels, and

112
00:12:05,58 --> 00:12:11,33
 by mine own voice, and by the voice of

113
00:12:11,33 --> 00:12:17,08
 thunderings, and by the voice of lightnings, and by the

114
00:12:17,08 --> 00:12:22,83
 voice of tempests, and by the voice of earthquakes,

115
00:12:22,83 --> 00:12:28,58
 and great hailstorms, and by the voice of famines

116
00:12:28,58 --> 00:12:34,33
 and pestilences of every kind, and by the great

117
00:12:34,33 --> 00:12:40,08
 sound of a trump, and by the voice of judgment, and by

118
00:12:40,08 --> 00:12:45,83
 the voice of mercy all the day long, and by the

119
00:12:45,83 --> 00:12:51,58
 voice of glory and honor and the riches of eternal

120
00:12:51,58 --> 00:12:57,33
 life, and would have saved you with an everlasting

121
00:12:57,33 --> 00:13:03,08
 salvation, but ye would not

122
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:09,299
26 Behold, the day has come, when the cup of the

123
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:15,299
 wrath of mine indignation is full

124
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:20,095
27 Behold, verily I say unto you, that these are

125
00:13:20,095 --> 00:13:24,595
 the words of the Lord your God

126
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:31,054
28 Wherefore, labor ye, labor ye in my vineyard

127
00:13:31,054 --> 00:13:37,721
 for the last time—for the last time call upon the

128
00:13:37,721 --> 00:13:44,388
 inhabitants of the earth

129
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:51,574
29 For in mine own due time will I come upon the

130
00:13:51,574 --> 00:13:58,241
 earth in judgment, and my people shall be redeemed

131
00:13:58,241 --> 00:14:04,908
 and shall reign with me on earth

132
00:14:04,41 --> 00:14:12,41
30 For the great Millennium, of which I have

133
00:14:12,41 --> 00:14:20,41
 spoken by the mouth of my servants, shall come

134
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:26,06
31 For Satan shall be bound, and when he is loosed

135
00:14:26,06 --> 00:14:31,727
 again he shall only reign for a little season,

136
00:14:31,727 --> 00:14:37,394
 and then cometh the end of the earth

137
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:44,344
32 And he that liveth in righteousness shall be

138
00:14:44,344 --> 00:14:51,011
 changed in the twinkling of an eye, and the earth

139
00:14:51,011 --> 00:14:57,678
 shall pass away so as by fire

140
00:14:57,18 --> 00:15:04,93
33 And the wicked shall go away into unquenchable

141
00:15:04,93 --> 00:15:12,68
 fire, and their end no man knoweth on earth, nor

142
00:15:12,68 --> 00:15:20,43
 ever shall know, until they come before me in

143
00:15:20,43 --> 00:15:28,18
 judgment

144
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:35,411
34 Hearken ye to these words. Behold, I am Jesus

145
00:15:35,411 --> 00:15:42,661
 Christ, the Savior of the world. Treasure these

146
00:15:42,661 --> 00:15:49,911
 things up in your hearts, and let the solemnities of

147
00:15:49,911 --> 00:15:57,161
 eternity rest upon your minds

148
00:15:57,907 --> 00:16:05,407
35 Be sober. Keep all my commandments. Even so.

149
00:16:05,407 --> 00:16:12,907
 Amen.
