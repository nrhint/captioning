00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 43 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, in February

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
1831. At this time some members of the Church were

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
disturbed by people making false claims as

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
revelators. The Prophet inquired of the Lord and

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
received this communication addressed to the elders

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of the Church. The first part deals with matters

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of Church polity; the latter part contains a

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
warning that the elders are to give to the nations

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of the earth. 
1–7, Revelations and

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
commandments come only through the one appointed; 
8–14,

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
The Saints are sanctified by acting in all

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
holiness before the Lord; 
15–22, Elders are sent forth

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
to cry repentance and prepare men for the great

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
day of the Lord; 
23–28, The Lord calls upon

16
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
men by His own voice and through the forces of

17
00:00:00,0 --> 02:14:47,
nature; 
29–35, The Millennium and the binding of Satan will come. 

18
02:14:47,0 --> 02:14:47,0
1 O hearken, ye elders of my church, and give

19
02:14:47,0 --> 02:19:51,
ear to the words which I shall speak unto you.

20
02:19:51,0 --> 02:19:51,0
2 For behold, verily, verily, I say unto

21
02:19:51,0 --> 02:19:51,0
you, that ye have received a

22
02:19:51,0 --> 02:19:51,0
commandment for a law unto my church, through him

23
02:19:51,0 --> 02:19:51,0
whom I have appointed unto you to

24
02:19:51,0 --> 02:20:55,
receive commandments and revelations from my hand.

25
02:20:55,0 --> 02:20:55,0
3 And this ye shall know assuredly—that

26
02:20:55,0 --> 02:20:55,0
there is none other appointed unto you

27
02:20:55,0 --> 02:20:55,0
to receive commandments and

28
02:20:55,0 --> 02:27:58,
revelations until he be taken, if he abide in me.

29
02:27:58,0 --> 02:27:58,0
4 But verily, verily, I say unto

30
02:27:58,0 --> 02:27:58,0
you, that none else shall be

31
02:27:58,0 --> 02:27:58,0
appointed unto this gift except it be

32
02:27:58,0 --> 02:27:58,0
through him; for if it be taken from

33
02:27:58,0 --> 02:27:58,0
him he shall not have power

34
02:27:58,0 --> 02:37:00,
except to appoint another in his stead.

35
02:37:00,0 --> 02:37:00,0
5 And this shall be a law unto

36
02:37:00,0 --> 02:37:00,0
you, that ye receive not the

37
02:37:00,0 --> 02:37:00,0
teachings of any that shall come before

38
02:37:00,0 --> 02:51:04,
you as revelations or commandments;

39
02:51:04,0 --> 02:51:04,0
6 And this I give unto you that

40
02:51:04,0 --> 02:51:04,0
you may not be deceived, that

41
02:51:04,0 --> 03:18:03,
you may know they are not of me.

42
03:18:03,0 --> 03:18:03,0
7 For verily I say unto you,

43
03:18:03,0 --> 03:18:03,0
that he that is ordained of

44
03:18:03,0 --> 03:18:03,0
me shall come in at the gate

45
03:18:03,0 --> 03:18:03,0
and be ordained as I have told

46
03:18:03,0 --> 03:18:03,0
you before, to teach those

47
03:18:03,0 --> 03:18:03,0
revelations which you have

48
03:18:03,0 --> 03:18:03,0
received and shall receive

49
03:18:03,0 --> 03:41:04,
through him whom I have appointed.

50
03:41:04,0 --> 03:41:04,0
8 And now, behold, I give

51
03:41:04,0 --> 03:41:04,0
unto you a commandment, that

52
03:41:04,0 --> 03:41:04,0
when ye are assembled

53
03:41:04,0 --> 03:41:04,0
together ye shall instruct and

54
03:41:04,0 --> 03:41:04,0
edify each other, that ye

55
03:41:04,0 --> 03:41:04,0
may know how to act and

56
03:41:04,0 --> 03:41:04,0
direct my church, how to act

57
03:41:04,0 --> 03:41:04,0
upon the points of my law and

58
03:41:04,0 --> 03:56:06,
commandments, which I have given.

59
03:56:06,0 --> 03:56:06,0
9 And thus ye shall

60
03:56:06,0 --> 03:56:06,0
become instructed in the law

61
03:56:06,0 --> 03:56:06,0
of my church, and be

62
03:56:06,0 --> 03:56:06,0
sanctified by that which ye

63
03:56:06,0 --> 03:56:06,0
have received, and ye shall

64
03:56:06,0 --> 03:56:06,0
bind yourselves to act

65
03:56:06,0 --> 03:59:45,
in all holiness before me—

66
03:59:45,0 --> 03:59:45,0
10 That inasmuch as ye

67
03:59:45,0 --> 03:59:45,0
do this, glory shall be

68
03:59:45,0 --> 03:59:45,0
added to the kingdom

69
03:59:45,0 --> 03:59:45,0
which ye have received.

70
03:59:45,0 --> 03:59:45,0
Inasmuch as ye do it not, it

71
03:59:45,0 --> 03:59:45,0
shall be taken, even

72
03:59:45,0 --> 04:06:47,
that which ye have received.

73
04:06:47,0 --> 04:06:47,0
11 Purge ye out the

74
04:06:47,0 --> 04:06:47,0
iniquity which is

75
04:06:47,0 --> 04:06:47,0
among you; sanctify

76
04:06:47,0 --> 04:07:51,
yourselves before me;

77
04:07:51,0 --> 04:07:51,0
12 And if ye

78
04:07:51,0 --> 04:07:51,0
desire the glories of

79
04:07:51,0 --> 04:07:51,0
the kingdom,

80
04:07:51,0 --> 04:07:51,0
appoint ye my

81
04:07:51,0 --> 04:07:51,0
servant Joseph Smith,

82
04:07:51,0 --> 04:07:51,0
Jun., and uphold

83
04:07:51,0 --> 04:07:51,0
him before me by

84
04:07:51,0 --> 04:10:53,
the prayer of faith.

85
04:10:53,0 --> 04:10:53,0
13 And again, I

86
04:10:53,0 --> 04:10:53,0
say unto you,

87
04:10:53,0 --> 04:10:53,0
that if ye desire

88
04:10:53,0 --> 04:10:53,0
the mysteries of

89
04:10:53,0 --> 04:10:53,0
the kingdom,

90
04:10:53,0 --> 04:10:53,0
provide for him

91
04:10:53,0 --> 04:10:53,0
food and raiment,

92
04:10:53,0 --> 04:10:53,0
and whatsoever

93
04:10:53,0 --> 04:10:53,0
thing he needeth

94
04:10:53,0 --> 04:10:53,0
to accomplish

95
04:10:53,0 --> 04:10:53,0
the work wherewith

96
04:10:53,0 --> 04:29:52,
I have commanded him;

97
04:29:52,0 --> 04:29:52,0
14 And if ye do

98
04:29:52,0 --> 04:29:52,0
it not he shall

99
04:29:52,0 --> 04:29:52,0
remain unto them

100
04:29:52,0 --> 04:29:52,0
that have

101
04:29:52,0 --> 04:29:52,0
received him, that I

102
04:29:52,0 --> 04:29:52,0
may reserve unto

103
04:29:52,0 --> 04:29:52,0
myself a pure

104
04:29:52,0 --> 04:40:53,
people before me.

105
04:40:53,0 --> 04:40:53,0
15 Again I say,

106
04:40:53,0 --> 04:40:53,0
hearken ye

107
04:40:53,0 --> 04:40:53,0
elders of my

108
04:40:53,0 --> 04:40:53,0
church, whom I have

109
04:40:53,0 --> 04:40:53,0
appointed: Ye

110
04:40:53,0 --> 04:40:53,0
are not sent

111
04:40:53,0 --> 04:40:53,0
forth to be

112
04:40:53,0 --> 04:40:53,0
taught, but to teach

113
04:40:53,0 --> 04:40:53,0
the children of

114
04:40:53,0 --> 04:40:53,0
men the things

115
04:40:53,0 --> 04:40:53,0
which I have

116
04:40:53,0 --> 04:40:53,0
put into your

117
04:40:53,0 --> 04:40:53,0
hands by the

118
04:40:53,0 --> 04:45:58,
power of my Spirit;

119
04:45:58,0 --> 04:45:58,0
16 And ye are

120
04:45:58,0 --> 04:45:58,0
to be taught

121
04:45:58,0 --> 04:45:58,0
from on

122
04:45:58,0 --> 04:45:58,0
high. Sanctify

123
04:45:58,0 --> 04:45:58,0
yourselves and

124
04:45:58,0 --> 04:45:58,0
ye shall be

125
04:45:58,0 --> 04:45:58,0
endowed with

126
04:45:58,0 --> 04:45:58,0
power, that ye

127
04:45:58,0 --> 04:45:58,0
may give

128
04:45:58,0 --> 05:16:00,
even as I have spoken.

129
05:16:00,0 --> 05:16:00,0
17 Hearken

130
05:16:00,0 --> 05:16:00,0
ye, for,

131
05:16:00,0 --> 05:16:00,0
behold, the

132
05:16:00,0 --> 05:16:00,0
great day of

133
05:16:00,0 --> 05:16:00,0
the Lord

134
05:16:00,0 --> 05:38:03,
is nigh at hand.

135
05:38:03,0 --> 05:38:03,0
18 For the

136
05:38:03,0 --> 05:38:03,0
day

137
05:38:03,0 --> 05:38:03,0
cometh that the

138
05:38:03,0 --> 05:38:03,0
Lord

139
05:38:03,0 --> 05:38:03,0
shall utter

140
05:38:03,0 --> 05:38:03,0
his voice

141
05:38:03,0 --> 05:38:03,0
out of

142
05:38:03,0 --> 05:38:03,0
heaven; the

143
05:38:03,0 --> 05:38:03,0
heavens shall

144
05:38:03,0 --> 05:38:03,0
shake and

145
05:38:03,0 --> 05:38:03,0
the earth

146
05:38:03,0 --> 05:38:03,0
shall

147
05:38:03,0 --> 05:38:03,0
tremble, and

148
05:38:03,0 --> 05:38:03,0
the trump

149
05:38:03,0 --> 05:38:03,0
of God

150
05:38:03,0 --> 05:38:03,0
shall sound

151
05:38:03,0 --> 05:38:03,0
both long

152
05:38:03,0 --> 05:38:03,0
and loud,

153
05:38:03,0 --> 05:38:03,0
and shall

154
05:38:03,0 --> 05:38:03,0
say to the

155
05:38:03,0 --> 05:38:03,0
sleeping

156
05:38:03,0 --> 05:38:03,0
nations: Ye

157
05:38:03,0 --> 05:38:03,0
saints

158
05:38:03,0 --> 05:38:03,0
arise and

159
05:38:03,0 --> 05:38:03,0
live; ye

160
05:38:03,0 --> 05:38:03,0
sinners stay

161
05:38:03,0 --> 05:45:40,
and sleep until I shall call again.

162
05:45:40,0 --> 05:45:40,0
19

163
05:45:40,0 --> 05:45:40,0
Wherefore gird

164
05:45:40,0 --> 05:45:40,0
up your

165
05:45:40,0 --> 05:45:40,0
loins lest

166
05:45:40,0 --> 05:45:40,0
ye be

167
05:45:40,0 --> 05:45:40,0
found among

168
05:45:40,0 --> 05:54:42,
the wicked.

169
05:54:42,0 --> 05:54:42,0
20 Lift

170
05:54:42,0 --> 05:54:42,0
up your

171
05:54:42,0 --> 05:54:42,0
voices

172
05:54:42,0 --> 05:54:42,0
and spare

173
05:54:42,0 --> 05:54:42,0
not.

174
05:54:42,0 --> 05:54:42,0
Call upon

175
05:54:42,0 --> 05:54:42,0
the

176
05:54:42,0 --> 05:54:42,0
nations to

177
05:54:42,0 --> 05:54:42,0
repent,

178
05:54:42,0 --> 05:54:42,0
both old

179
05:54:42,0 --> 05:54:42,0
and

180
05:54:42,0 --> 05:54:42,0
young, both

181
05:54:42,0 --> 05:54:42,0
bond and

182
05:54:42,0 --> 05:54:42,0
free,

183
05:54:42,0 --> 05:54:42,0
saying:

184
05:54:42,0 --> 05:54:42,0
Prepare

185
05:54:42,0 --> 05:54:42,0


186
05:54:42,0 --> 05:54:42,0
yourselves for

187
05:54:42,0 --> 05:59:47,
the great day of the Lord;

188
05:59:47,0 --> 05:59:47,0
21 For

189
05:59:47,0 --> 05:59:47,0
if I, who

190
05:59:47,0 --> 05:59:47,0
am a

191
05:59:47,0 --> 05:59:47,0
man, do

192
05:59:47,0 --> 05:59:47,0
lift up my

193
05:59:47,0 --> 05:59:47,0

194
05:59:47,0 --> 05:59:47,0
and call

195
05:59:47,0 --> 05:59:47,0
upon you

196
05:59:47,0 --> 05:59:47,0
to

197
05:59:47,0 --> 05:59:47,0
repent, and

198
05:59:47,0 --> 05:59:47,0
ye hate

199
05:59:47,0 --> 05:59:47,0
me, what

200
05:59:47,0 --> 05:59:47,0
will ye

201
05:59:47,0 --> 05:59:47,0
say

202
05:59:47,0 --> 05:59:47,0
when the

203
05:59:47,0 --> 05:59:47,0
day cometh

204
05:59:47,0 --> 05:59:47,0
when

205
05:59:47,0 --> 05:59:47,0
the

206
05:59:47,0 --> 05:59:47,0
thunders shall

207
05:59:47,0 --> 05:59:47,0
utter

208
05:59:47,0 --> 05:59:47,0
their

209
05:59:47,0 --> 05:59:47,0
voices from

210
05:59:47,0 --> 05:59:47,0
the

211
05:59:47,0 --> 05:59:47,0
ends of the

212
05:59:47,0 --> 05:59:47,0
earth,

213
05:59:47,0 --> 05:59:47,0
speaking

214
05:59:47,0 --> 05:59:47,0
to the

215
05:59:47,0 --> 05:59:47,0
ears of

216
05:59:47,0 --> 05:59:47,0
all that

217
05:59:47,0 --> 05:59:47,0
live,

218
05:59:47,0 --> 05:59:47,0


219
05:59:47,0 --> 05:59:47,0
saying—Repent,

220
05:59:47,0 --> 05:59:47,0
and

221
