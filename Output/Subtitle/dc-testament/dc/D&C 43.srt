1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,529
Section 43 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:01,529 --> 00:00:03,058
the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, in February

3
00:00:03,058 --> 00:00:04,587
1831. At this time some members of the Church were

4
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:06,116
disturbed by people making false claims as

5
00:00:06,116 --> 00:00:07,645
revelators. The Prophet inquired of the Lord and

6
00:00:07,645 --> 00:00:09,174
received this communication addressed to the elders

7
00:00:09,174 --> 00:00:10,703
of the Church. The first part deals with matters

8
00:00:10,703 --> 00:00:12,232
of Church polity; the latter part contains a

9
00:00:12,232 --> 00:00:13,761
warning that the elders are to give to the nations

10
00:00:13,761 --> 00:00:15,29
of the earth. 
1–7, Revelations and

11
00:00:15,29 --> 00:00:16,819
commandments come only through the one appointed; 
8–14,

12
00:00:16,819 --> 00:00:18,348
The Saints are sanctified by acting in all

13
00:00:18,348 --> 00:00:19,877
holiness before the Lord; 
15–22, Elders are sent forth

14
00:00:19,877 --> 00:00:21,406
to cry repentance and prepare men for the great

15
00:00:21,406 --> 00:00:22,935
day of the Lord; 
23–28, The Lord calls upon

16
00:00:22,935 --> 00:00:24,464
men by His own voice and through the forces of

17
00:00:24,464 --> 00:00:26,527
nature; 
29–35, The Millennium and the binding of Satan will come. 

18
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:36,026
1 O hearken, ye elders of my church, and give

19
00:00:36,026 --> 00:00:45,529
ear to the words which I shall speak unto you.

20
00:00:45,529 --> 00:00:47,729
2 For behold, verily, verily, I say unto

21
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:49,929
you, that ye have received a

22
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:52,129
commandment for a law unto my church, through him

23
00:00:52,129 --> 00:00:54,329
whom I have appointed unto you to

24
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:56,54
receive commandments and revelations from my hand.

25
00:00:56,54 --> 00:01:13,29
3 And this ye shall know assuredly—that

26
00:01:13,29 --> 00:01:30,04
there is none other appointed unto you

27
00:01:30,04 --> 00:01:46,79
to receive commandments and

28
00:01:46,79 --> 00:02:03,49
revelations until he be taken, if he abide in me.

29
00:02:03,49 --> 00:02:05,49
4 But verily, verily, I say unto

30
00:02:05,49 --> 00:02:07,49
you, that none else shall be

31
00:02:07,49 --> 00:02:09,49
appointed unto this gift except it be

32
00:02:09,49 --> 00:02:11,49
through him; for if it be taken from

33
00:02:11,49 --> 00:02:13,49
him he shall not have power

34
00:02:13,49 --> 00:02:15,602
except to appoint another in his stead.

35
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:18,852
5 And this shall be a law unto

36
00:02:18,852 --> 00:02:22,102
you, that ye receive not the

37
00:02:22,102 --> 00:02:25,352
teachings of any that shall come before

38
00:02:25,352 --> 00:02:28,215
you as revelations or commandments;

39
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:35,882
6 And this I give unto you that

40
00:02:35,882 --> 00:02:43,549
you may not be deceived, that

41
00:02:43,549 --> 00:02:51,254
you may know they are not of me.

42
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:54,504
7 For verily I say unto you,

43
00:02:54,504 --> 00:02:57,754
that he that is ordained of

44
00:02:57,754 --> 00:03:01,004
me shall come in at the gate

45
00:03:01,004 --> 00:03:04,254
and be ordained as I have told

46
00:03:04,254 --> 00:03:07,504
you before, to teach those

47
00:03:07,504 --> 00:03:10,754
revelations which you have

48
00:03:10,754 --> 00:03:14,004
received and shall receive

49
00:03:14,004 --> 00:03:17,798
through him whom I have appointed.

50
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:18,576
8 And now, behold, I give

51
00:03:18,576 --> 00:03:19,354
unto you a commandment, that

52
00:03:19,354 --> 00:03:20,132
when ye are assembled

53
00:03:20,132 --> 00:03:20,91
together ye shall instruct and

54
00:03:20,91 --> 00:03:21,688
edify each other, that ye

55
00:03:21,688 --> 00:03:22,466
may know how to act and

56
00:03:22,466 --> 00:03:23,244
direct my church, how to act

57
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,022
upon the points of my law and

58
00:03:24,022 --> 00:03:24,855
commandments, which I have given.

59
00:03:24,855 --> 00:03:26,569
9 And thus ye shall

60
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:28,283
become instructed in the law

61
00:03:28,283 --> 00:03:29,997
of my church, and be

62
00:03:29,997 --> 00:03:31,711
sanctified by that which ye

63
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,425
have received, and ye shall

64
00:03:33,425 --> 00:03:35,139
bind yourselves to act

65
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:36,483
in all holiness before me—

66
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:36,626
10 That inasmuch as ye

67
00:03:36,626 --> 00:03:36,769
do this, glory shall be

68
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:36,912
added to the kingdom

69
00:03:36,912 --> 00:03:37,055
which ye have received.

70
00:03:37,055 --> 00:03:37,198
Inasmuch as ye do it not, it

71
00:03:37,198 --> 00:03:37,341
shall be taken, even

72
00:03:37,341 --> 00:03:37,551
that which ye have received.

73
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:36,551
11 Purge ye out the

74
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:35,551
iniquity which is

75
00:03:35,551 --> 00:03:34,551
among you; sanctify

76
00:03:34,551 --> 00:03:33,213
yourselves before me;

77
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:32,588
12 And if ye

78
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:31,963
desire the glories of

79
00:03:31,963 --> 00:03:31,338
the kingdom,

80
00:03:31,338 --> 00:03:30,713
appoint ye my

81
00:03:30,713 --> 00:03:30,088
servant Joseph Smith,

82
00:03:30,088 --> 00:03:29,463
Jun., and uphold

83
00:03:29,463 --> 00:03:28,838
him before me by

84
00:03:28,838 --> 00:03:28,875
the prayer of faith.

85
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,542
13 And again, I

86
00:03:30,542 --> 00:03:32,209
say unto you,

87
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:33,876
that if ye desire

88
00:03:33,876 --> 00:03:35,543
the mysteries of

89
00:03:35,543 --> 00:03:37,21
the kingdom,

90
00:03:37,21 --> 00:03:38,877
provide for him

91
00:03:38,877 --> 00:03:40,544
food and raiment,

92
00:03:40,544 --> 00:03:42,211
and whatsoever

93
00:03:42,211 --> 00:03:43,878
thing he needeth

94
00:03:43,878 --> 00:03:45,545
to accomplish

95
00:03:45,545 --> 00:03:47,212
the work wherewith

96
00:03:47,212 --> 00:03:48,512
I have commanded him;

97
00:03:48,512 --> 00:03:50,012
14 And if ye do

98
00:03:50,012 --> 00:03:51,512
it not he shall

99
00:03:51,512 --> 00:03:53,012
remain unto them

100
00:03:53,012 --> 00:03:54,512
that have

101
00:03:54,512 --> 00:03:56,012
received him, that I

102
00:03:56,012 --> 00:03:57,512
may reserve unto

103
00:03:57,512 --> 00:03:59,012
myself a pure

104
00:03:59,012 --> 00:04:00,157
people before me.

105
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:00,943
15 Again I say,

106
00:04:00,943 --> 00:04:01,729
hearken ye

107
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:02,515
elders of my

108
00:04:02,515 --> 00:04:03,301
church, whom I have

109
00:04:03,301 --> 00:04:04,087
appointed: Ye

110
00:04:04,087 --> 00:04:04,873
are not sent

111
00:04:04,873 --> 00:04:05,659
forth to be

112
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:06,445
taught, but to teach

113
00:04:06,445 --> 00:04:07,231
the children of

114
00:04:07,231 --> 00:04:08,017
men the things

115
00:04:08,017 --> 00:04:08,803
which I have

116
00:04:08,803 --> 00:04:09,589
put into your

117
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:10,375
hands by the

118
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,184
power of my Spirit;

119
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:12,984
16 And ye are

120
00:04:12,984 --> 00:04:14,784
to be taught

121
00:04:14,784 --> 00:04:16,584
from on

122
00:04:16,584 --> 00:04:18,384
high. Sanctify

123
00:04:18,384 --> 00:04:20,184
yourselves and

124
00:04:20,184 --> 00:04:21,984
ye shall be

125
00:04:21,984 --> 00:04:23,784
endowed with

126
00:04:23,784 --> 00:04:25,584
power, that ye

127
00:04:25,584 --> 00:04:27,384
may give

128
00:04:27,384 --> 00:04:29,719
even as I have spoken.

129
00:04:29,719 --> 00:04:31,552
17 Hearken

130
00:04:31,552 --> 00:04:33,385
ye, for,

131
00:04:33,385 --> 00:04:35,218
behold, the

132
00:04:35,218 --> 00:04:37,051
great day of

133
00:04:37,051 --> 00:04:38,884
the Lord

134
00:04:38,884 --> 00:04:40,73
is nigh at hand.

135
00:04:40,73 --> 00:04:40,582
18 For the

136
00:04:40,582 --> 00:04:40,434
day

137
00:04:40,434 --> 00:04:40,286
cometh that the

138
00:04:40,286 --> 00:04:40,138
Lord

139
00:04:40,138 --> 00:04:39,99
shall utter

140
00:04:39,99 --> 00:04:39,842
his voice

141
00:04:39,842 --> 00:04:39,694
out of

142
00:04:39,694 --> 00:04:39,546
heaven; the

143
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:39,398
heavens shall

144
00:04:39,398 --> 00:04:39,25
shake and

145
00:04:39,25 --> 00:04:39,102
the earth

146
00:04:39,102 --> 00:04:38,954
shall

147
00:04:38,954 --> 00:04:38,806
tremble, and

148
00:04:38,806 --> 00:04:38,658
the trump

149
00:04:38,658 --> 00:04:38,51
of God

150
00:04:38,51 --> 00:04:38,362
shall sound

151
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:38,214
both long

152
00:04:38,214 --> 00:04:38,066
and loud,

153
00:04:38,066 --> 00:04:37,918
and shall

154
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:37,77
say to the

155
00:04:37,77 --> 00:04:37,622
sleeping

156
00:04:37,622 --> 00:04:37,474
nations: Ye

157
00:04:37,474 --> 00:04:37,326
saints

158
00:04:37,326 --> 00:04:37,178
arise and

159
00:04:37,178 --> 00:04:37,03
live; ye

160
00:04:37,03 --> 00:04:36,882
sinners stay

161
00:04:36,882 --> 00:04:36,393
and sleep until I shall call again.

162
00:04:36,393 --> 00:04:36,964
19

163
00:04:36,964 --> 00:04:37,535
Wherefore gird

164
00:04:37,535 --> 00:04:38,106
up your

165
00:04:38,106 --> 00:04:38,677
loins lest

166
00:04:38,677 --> 00:04:39,248
ye be

167
00:04:39,248 --> 00:04:39,819
found among

168
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:40,514
the wicked.

169
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:40,514
20 Lift

170
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:40,514
up your

171
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:40,514
voices

172
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:40,514
and spare

173
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:40,514
not.

174
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:40,514
Call upon

175
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:40,514
the

176
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:40,514
nations to

177
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:40,514
repent,

178
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:40,514
both old

179
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:40,514
and

180
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:40,514
young, both

181
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:40,514
bond and

182
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:40,514
free,

183
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:40,514
saying:

184
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:40,514
Prepare

185
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:40,514


186
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:40,514
yourselves for

187
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:40,147
the great day of the Lord;

188
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:40,012
21 For

189
00:04:40,012 --> 00:04:39,877
if I, who

190
00:04:39,877 --> 00:04:39,742
am a

191
00:04:39,742 --> 00:04:39,607
man, do

192
00:04:39,607 --> 00:04:39,472
lift up my

193
00:04:39,472 --> 00:04:39,337
voice

194
00:04:39,337 --> 00:04:39,202
and call

195
00:04:39,202 --> 00:04:39,067
upon you

196
00:04:39,067 --> 00:04:38,932
to

197
00:04:38,932 --> 00:04:38,797
repent, and

198
00:04:38,797 --> 00:04:38,662
