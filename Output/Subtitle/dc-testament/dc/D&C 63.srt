00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 63 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, August 30, 1831.

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
The Prophet, Sidney Rigdon, and Oliver Cowdery

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
had arrived in Kirtland on August 27 from their

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
visit to Missouri. Joseph Smith’s history describes

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
this revelation: “In these infant days of the

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Church, there was a great anxiety to obtain the word

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of the Lord upon every subject that in any way

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
concerned our salvation; and as the land of Zion

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
was now the most important temporal object in

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
view, I enquired of the Lord for further information

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
upon the gathering of the Saints, and the

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
purchase of the land, and other matters.” 
1–6, A day of

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
wrath will come upon the wicked; 
7–12, Signs

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
come by faith; 
13–19, The adulterous in heart will

16
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
deny the faith and be cast into the lake of

17
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
fire; 
20, The faithful will receive an inheritance

18
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
upon the transfigured earth; 
21, A full account

19
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of the events on the Mount of Transfiguration has

20
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
not yet been revealed; 
22–23, The obedient

21
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
receive the mysteries of the kingdom; 
24–31,

22
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Inheritances in Zion are to be purchased; 
32–35, The

23
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Lord decrees wars, and the wicked slay the wicked;

24
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
36–48, The Saints are to gather to Zion and

25
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
provide moneys to build it up; 
49–54, Blessings are

26
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
assured the faithful at the Second Coming, in the

27
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Resurrection, and during the Millennium; 
55–58,

28
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
This is a day of warning; 
59–66, The Lord’s name

29
00:00:00,0 --> 03:23:14,
is taken in vain by those who use it without authority. 

30
03:23:14,0 --> 03:23:14,0
1 Hearken, O ye people, and open your hearts

31
03:23:14,0 --> 03:23:14,0
and give ear from afar; and listen, you that call

32
03:23:14,0 --> 03:23:14,0
yourselves the people of the Lord, and hear

33
03:23:14,0 --> 03:28:19,
the word of the Lord and his will concerning you.

34
03:28:19,0 --> 03:28:19,0
2 Yea, verily, I say, hear the

35
03:28:19,0 --> 03:28:19,0
word of him whose anger is kindled

36
03:28:19,0 --> 03:43:21,
against the wicked and rebellious;

37
03:43:21,0 --> 03:43:21,0
3 Who willeth to take

38
03:43:21,0 --> 03:43:21,0
even them whom he will take,

39
03:43:21,0 --> 03:43:21,0
and preserveth in life

40
03:43:21,0 --> 03:53:24,
them whom he will preserve;

41
03:53:24,0 --> 03:53:24,0
4 Who buildeth up at his

42
03:53:24,0 --> 03:53:24,0
own will and pleasure;

43
03:53:24,0 --> 03:53:24,0
and destroyeth when he

44
03:53:24,0 --> 03:53:24,0
pleases, and is able to

45
03:53:24,0 --> 04:05:02,
cast the soul down to hell.

46
04:05:02,0 --> 04:05:02,0
5 Behold, I, the

47
04:05:02,0 --> 04:05:02,0
Lord, utter my voice,

48
04:05:02,0 --> 04:16:40,
and it shall be obeyed.

49
04:16:40,0 --> 04:16:40,0
6 Wherefore, verily

50
04:16:40,0 --> 04:16:40,0
I say, let the

51
04:16:40,0 --> 04:16:40,0
wicked take heed, and

52
04:16:40,0 --> 04:16:40,0
let the rebellious

53
04:16:40,0 --> 04:16:40,0
fear and tremble;

54
04:16:40,0 --> 04:16:40,0
and let the

55
04:16:40,0 --> 04:16:40,0
unbelieving hold their

56
04:16:40,0 --> 04:16:40,0
lips, for the day of

57
04:16:40,0 --> 04:16:40,0
wrath shall come upon

58
04:16:40,0 --> 04:16:40,0
them as a

59
04:16:40,0 --> 04:16:40,0
whirlwind, and all flesh

60
04:16:40,0 --> 04:30:44,
shall know that I am God.

61
04:30:44,0 --> 04:30:44,0
7 And he that

62
04:30:44,0 --> 04:30:44,0
seeketh signs shall

63
04:30:44,0 --> 04:30:44,0
see signs, but

64
04:30:44,0 --> 04:51:47,
not unto salvation.

65
04:51:47,0 --> 04:51:47,0
8 Verily, I say

66
04:51:47,0 --> 04:51:47,0
unto you, there

67
04:51:47,0 --> 04:51:47,0
are those among

68
04:51:47,0 --> 04:51:47,0
you who seek

69
04:51:47,0 --> 04:51:47,0
signs, and there

70
04:51:47,0 --> 04:51:47,0
have been such

71
04:51:47,0 --> 04:47:27,
even from the beginning;

72
04:47:27,0 --> 04:47:27,0
9 But, behold,

73
04:47:27,0 --> 04:47:27,0
faith cometh

74
04:47:27,0 --> 04:47:27,0
not by signs, but

75
04:47:27,0 --> 04:47:27,0
signs follow

76
04:47:27,0 --> 04:52:32,
those that believe.

77
04:52:32,0 --> 04:52:32,0
10 Yea, signs

78
04:52:32,0 --> 04:52:32,0
come by

79
04:52:32,0 --> 04:52:32,0
faith, not by the

80
04:52:32,0 --> 04:52:32,0
will of men,

81
04:52:32,0 --> 04:52:32,0
nor as they

82
04:52:32,0 --> 04:52:32,0
please, but

83
04:52:32,0 --> 05:01:35,
by the will of God.

84
05:01:35,0 --> 05:01:35,0
11 Yea,

85
05:01:35,0 --> 05:01:35,0
signs come by

86
05:01:35,0 --> 05:01:35,0
faith, unto

87
05:01:35,0 --> 05:01:35,0
mighty works,

88
05:01:35,0 --> 05:01:35,0
for without

89
05:01:35,0 --> 05:01:35,0
faith no man

90
05:01:35,0 --> 05:01:35,0
pleaseth

91
05:01:35,0 --> 05:01:35,0
God; and with

92
05:01:35,0 --> 05:01:35,0
whom God is

93
05:01:35,0 --> 05:01:35,0
angry he is

94
05:01:35,0 --> 05:01:35,0
not well

95
05:01:35,0 --> 05:01:35,0
pleased;

96
05:01:35,0 --> 05:01:35,0
wherefore, unto

97
05:01:35,0 --> 05:01:35,0
such he

98
05:01:35,0 --> 05:01:35,0
showeth no signs,

99
05:01:35,0 --> 05:01:35,0
only in

100
05:01:35,0 --> 05:13:41,
wrath unto their condemnation.

101
05:13:41,0 --> 05:13:41,0
12

102
05:13:41,0 --> 05:13:41,0
Wherefore, I, the

103
05:13:41,0 --> 05:13:41,0
Lord, am not

104
05:13:41,0 --> 05:13:41,0
pleased with

105
05:13:41,0 --> 05:13:41,0
those among

106
05:13:41,0 --> 05:13:41,0
you who have

107
05:13:41,0 --> 05:13:41,0
sought after

108
05:13:41,0 --> 05:13:41,0
signs and

109
05:13:41,0 --> 05:13:41,0
wonders for

110
05:13:41,0 --> 05:13:41,0
faith, and

111
05:13:41,0 --> 05:13:41,0
not for the

112
05:13:41,0 --> 05:13:41,0
good of men

113
05:13:41,0 --> 05:18:46,
unto my glory.

114
05:18:46,0 --> 05:18:46,0
13

115
05:18:46,0 --> 05:18:46,0
Nevertheless, I give

116
05:18:46,0 --> 05:18:46,0


117
05:18:46,0 --> 05:18:46,0
commandments, and many

118
05:18:46,0 --> 05:18:46,0
have turned

119
05:18:46,0 --> 05:18:46,0
away from my

120
05:18:46,0 --> 05:18:46,0
commandments

121
05:18:46,0 --> 05:18:46,0
and have

122
05:18:46,0 --> 05:23:51,
not kept them.

123
05:23:51,0 --> 05:23:51,0
14 There

124
05:23:51,0 --> 05:23:51,0
were among

125
05:23:51,0 --> 05:23:51,0
you

126
05:23:51,0 --> 05:23:51,0
adulterers and

127
05:23:51,0 --> 05:23:51,0
adulteresses;

128
05:23:51,0 --> 05:23:51,0
some of whom

129
05:23:51,0 --> 05:23:51,0
have turned

130
05:23:51,0 --> 05:23:51,0
away from

131
05:23:51,0 --> 05:23:51,0
you, and

132
05:23:51,0 --> 05:23:51,0
others remain

133
05:23:51,0 --> 05:23:51,0
with you

134
05:23:51,0 --> 05:23:51,0
that

135
05:23:51,0 --> 05:37:55,
hereafter shall be revealed.

136
05:37:55,0 --> 05:37:55,0
15 Let such

137
05:37:55,0 --> 05:37:55,0
beware and

138
05:37:55,0 --> 05:37:55,0
repent

139
05:37:55,0 --> 05:37:55,0
speedily, lest

140
05:37:55,0 --> 05:37:55,0
judgment

141
05:37:55,0 --> 05:37:55,0
shall come

142
05:37:55,0 --> 05:37:55,0
upon them as

143
05:37:55,0 --> 05:37:55,0
a snare,

144
05:37:55,0 --> 05:37:55,0
and their

145
05:37:55,0 --> 05:37:55,0
folly shall

146
05:37:55,0 --> 05:37:55,0
be made

147
05:37:55,0 --> 05:37:55,0
manifest, and

148
05:37:55,0 --> 05:37:55,0
their works

149
05:37:55,0 --> 05:37:55,0
shall

150
05:37:55,0 --> 05:37:55,0
follow them in

151
05:37:55,0 --> 05:37:55,0
the eyes of

152
05:37:55,0 --> 05:57:32,
the people.

153
05:57:32,0 --> 05:57:32,0
16 And

154
05:57:32,0 --> 05:57:32,0
verily I say

155
05:57:32,0 --> 05:57:32,0
unto you, as

156
05:57:32,0 --> 05:57:32,0
I have said

157
05:57:32,0 --> 05:57:32,0
before, he

158
05:57:32,0 --> 05:57:32,0
that

159
05:57:32,0 --> 05:57:32,0
looketh on a

160
05:57:32,0 --> 05:57:32,0
woman to lust

161
05:57:32,0 --> 05:57:32,0
after her,

162
05:57:32,0 --> 05:57:32,0
or if any

163
05:57:32,0 --> 05:57:32,0
shall commit

164
05:57:32,0 --> 05:57:32,0
adultery

165
05:57:32,0 --> 05:57:32,0
in their

166
05:57:32,0 --> 05:57:32,0
hearts, they

167
05:57:32,0 --> 05:57:32,0
shall not

168
05:57:32,0 --> 05:57:32,0
have the

169
05:57:32,0 --> 05:57:32,0
Spirit, but

170
05:57:32,0 --> 05:57:32,0
shall deny the

171
05:57:32,0 --> 05:57:32,0
faith and

172
05:57:32,0 --> 06:10:36,
shall fear.

173
06:10:36,0 --> 06:10:36,0
17

174
06:10:36,0 --> 06:10:36,0
Wherefore, I, the

175
06:10:36,0 --> 06:10:36,0
Lord,

176
06:10:36,0 --> 06:10:36,0
have said

177
06:10:36,0 --> 06:10:36,0
that the

178
06:10:36,0 --> 06:10:36,0
fearful, and

179
06:10:36,0 --> 06:10:36,0
the

180
06:10:36,0 --> 06:10:36,0
unbelieving, and

181
06:10:36,0 --> 06:10:36,0
all liars,

182
06:10:36,0 --> 06:10:36,0
and

183
06:10:36,0 --> 06:10:36,0
whosoever

184
06:10:36,0 --> 06:10:36,0
loveth and

185
06:10:36,0 --> 06:10:36,0
maketh a lie,

186
06:10:36,0 --> 06:10:36,0
and the

187
06:10:36,0 --> 06:10:36,0
whoremonger,

188
06:10:36,0 --> 06:10:36,0
and the

189
06:10:36,0 --> 06:10:36,0
sorcerer,

190
06:10:36,0 --> 06:10:36,0
shall have

191
06:10:36,0 --> 06:10:36,0
their part

192
06:10:36,0 --> 06:10:36,0
in that

193
06:10:36,0 --> 06:10:36,0
lake which

194
06:10:36,0 --> 06:10:36,0
burneth

195
06:10:36,0 --> 06:10:36,0
with fire

196
06:10:36,0 --> 06:10:36,0
and

197
06:10:36,0 --> 06:33:37,
brimstone, which is the second death.

198
06:33:37,0 --> 06:33:37,0
18 Verily

199
06:33:37,0 --> 06:33:37,0
I say,

200
06:33:37,0 --> 06:33:37,0
that they

201
06:33:37,0 --> 06:33:37,0
shall not

202
06:33:37,0 --> 06:33:37,0
have

203
06:33:37,0 --> 06:33:37,0
part in the

204
06:33:37,0 --> 06:33:37,0
first

205
06:33:37,0 --> 06:46:41,
resurrection.

206
06:46:41,0 --> 06:46:41,0
19 And

207
06:46:41,0 --> 06:46:41,0
now

208
06:46:41,0 --> 06:46:41,0
behold, I,

209
06:46:41,0 --> 06:46:41,0
the Lord,

210
06:46:41,0 --> 06:46:41,0
say unto

211
06:46:41,0 --> 06:46:41,0
you

212
06:46:41,0 --> 06:46:41,0
that ye are

213
06:46:41,0 --> 06:46:41,0
not

214
06:46:41,0 --> 06:46:41,0
justified,

215
06:46:41,0 --> 06:46:41,0
because

216
06:46:41,0 --> 06:46:41,0
these

217
06:46:41,0 --> 06:42:21,
things are among you.

218
06:42:21,0 --> 06:42:21,0
20

219
06:42:21,0 --> 06:42:21,0


220
