00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:17,899
Section 63 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:17,899 --> 00:00:24,52
 the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, August 30, 1831.

3
00:00:24,52 --> 00:00:31,141
 The Prophet, Sidney Rigdon, and Oliver Cowdery had

4
00:00:31,141 --> 00:00:37,762
 arrived in Kirtland on August 27 from their visit

5
00:00:37,762 --> 00:00:44,383
 to Missouri. Joseph Smith’s history describes this

6
00:00:44,383 --> 00:00:51,004
 revelation: “In these infant days of the Church,

7
00:00:51,004 --> 00:00:57,625
 there was a great anxiety to obtain the word of the

8
00:00:57,625 --> 00:01:04,246
 Lord upon every subject that in any way concerned

9
00:01:04,246 --> 00:01:10,867
 our salvation; and as the land of Zion was now

10
00:01:10,867 --> 00:01:17,488
 the most important temporal object in view, I

11
00:01:17,488 --> 00:01:24,109
 enquired of the Lord for further information upon the

12
00:01:24,109 --> 00:01:30,73
 gathering of the Saints, and the purchase of the

13
00:01:30,73 --> 00:01:37,351
 land, and other matters.” 
1–6, A day of wrath will

14
00:01:37,351 --> 00:01:43,972
 come upon the wicked; 
7–12, Signs come by faith;

15
00:01:43,972 --> 00:01:50,593
13–19, The adulterous in heart will deny the faith

16
00:01:50,593 --> 00:01:57,214
 and be cast into the lake of fire; 
20, The

17
00:01:57,214 --> 00:02:03,835
 faithful will receive an inheritance upon the

18
00:02:03,835 --> 00:02:10,456
 transfigured earth; 
21, A full account of the events on

19
00:02:10,456 --> 00:02:17,077
 the Mount of Transfiguration has not yet been

20
00:02:17,077 --> 00:02:23,698
 revealed; 
22–23, The obedient receive the mysteries of

21
00:02:23,698 --> 00:02:30,319
 the kingdom; 
24–31, Inheritances in Zion are to

22
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:36,94
 be purchased; 
32–35, The Lord decrees wars, and

23
00:02:36,94 --> 00:02:43,561
 the wicked slay the wicked; 
36–48, The Saints are

24
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:50,182
 to gather to Zion and provide moneys to build it

25
00:02:50,182 --> 00:02:56,803
 up; 
49–54, Blessings are assured the faithful at

26
00:02:56,803 --> 00:03:03,424
 the Second Coming, in the Resurrection, and during

27
00:03:03,424 --> 00:03:10,045
 the Millennium; 
55–58, This is a day of warning;

28
00:03:10,045 --> 00:03:16,666
59–66, The Lord’s name is taken in vain by those

29
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:23,287
 who use it without authority.

30
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:28,787
1 Hearken, O ye people, and open your hearts and

31
00:03:28,787 --> 00:03:33,787
 give ear from afar; and listen, you that call

32
00:03:33,787 --> 00:03:38,787
 yourselves the people of the Lord, and hear the word of

33
00:03:38,787 --> 00:03:43,787
 the Lord and his will concerning you

34
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:47,491
2 Yea, verily, I say, hear the word of him whose

35
00:03:47,491 --> 00:03:51,158
 anger is kindled against the wicked and rebellious

36
00:03:51,158 --> 00:03:54,825


37
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:58,301
3 Who willeth to take even them whom he will take,

38
00:03:58,301 --> 00:04:01,968
 and preserveth in life them whom he will

39
00:04:01,968 --> 00:04:05,635
 preserve

40
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:10,645
4 Who buildeth up at his own will and pleasure;

41
00:04:10,645 --> 00:04:15,645
 and destroyeth when he pleases, and is able to cast

42
00:04:15,645 --> 00:04:20,645
 the soul down to hell

43
00:04:20,644 --> 00:04:23,644
5 Behold, I, the Lord, utter my voice, and it

44
00:04:23,644 --> 00:04:26,644
 shall be obeyed

45
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:32,333
6 Wherefore, verily I say, let the wicked take

46
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:37,733
 heed, and let the rebellious fear and tremble; and

47
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:43,133
 let the unbelieving hold their lips, for the day of

48
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:48,533
 wrath shall come upon them as a whirlwind, and all

49
00:04:48,533 --> 00:04:53,933
 flesh shall know that I am God

50
00:04:53,96 --> 00:04:58,96
7 And he that seeketh signs shall see signs, but

51
00:04:58,96 --> 00:05:03,96
 not unto salvation

52
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:06,67
8 Verily, I say unto you, there are those among

53
00:05:06,67 --> 00:05:10,337
 you who seek signs, and there have been such even

54
00:05:10,337 --> 00:05:14,004
 from the beginning

55
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:20,014
9 But, behold, faith cometh not by signs, but

56
00:05:20,014 --> 00:05:25,514
 signs follow those that believe

57
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:32,292
10 Yea, signs come by faith, not by the will of

58
00:05:32,292 --> 00:05:39,292
 men, nor as they please, but by the will of God

59
00:05:39,055 --> 00:05:45,655
11 Yea, signs come by faith, unto mighty works,

60
00:05:45,655 --> 00:05:52,255
 for without faith no man pleaseth God; and with whom

61
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:58,855
 God is angry he is not well pleased; wherefore,

62
00:05:58,855 --> 00:06:05,455
 unto such he showeth no signs, only in wrath unto

63
00:06:05,455 --> 00:06:12,055
 their condemnation

64
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:18,322
12 Wherefore, I, the Lord, am not pleased with

65
00:06:18,322 --> 00:06:24,072
 those among you who have sought after signs and

66
00:06:24,072 --> 00:06:29,822
 wonders for faith, and not for the good of men unto my

67
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:35,572
 glory

68
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:39,895
13 Nevertheless, I give commandments, and many

69
00:06:39,895 --> 00:06:44,228
 have turned away from my commandments and have not

70
00:06:44,228 --> 00:06:48,561
 kept them

71
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:53,358
14 There were among you adulterers and

72
00:06:53,358 --> 00:06:58,108
 adulteresses; some of whom have turned away from you, and

73
00:06:58,108 --> 00:07:02,858
 others remain with you that hereafter shall be

74
00:07:02,858 --> 00:07:07,608
 revealed

75
00:07:07,41 --> 00:07:12,66
15 Let such beware and repent speedily, lest

76
00:07:12,66 --> 00:07:17,91
 judgment shall come upon them as a snare, and their

77
00:07:17,91 --> 00:07:23,16
 folly shall be made manifest, and their works shall

78
00:07:23,16 --> 00:07:28,41
 follow them in the eyes of the people

79
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:32,781
16 And verily I say unto you, as I have said

80
00:07:32,781 --> 00:07:37,381
 before, he that looketh on a woman to lust after her,

81
00:07:37,381 --> 00:07:41,981
 or if any shall commit adultery in their hearts,

82
00:07:41,981 --> 00:07:46,581
 they shall not have the Spirit, but shall deny the

83
00:07:46,581 --> 00:07:51,181
 faith and shall fear

84
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:56,004
17 Wherefore, I, the Lord, have said that the

85
00:07:56,004 --> 00:08:00,837
 fearful, and the unbelieving, and all liars, and

86
00:08:00,837 --> 00:08:05,67
 whosoever loveth and maketh a lie, and the whoremonger,

87
00:08:05,67 --> 00:08:10,503
 and the sorcerer, shall have their part in that

88
00:08:10,503 --> 00:08:15,336
 lake which burneth with fire and brimstone, which

89
00:08:15,336 --> 00:08:20,169
 is the second death

90
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,917
18 Verily I say, that they shall not have part in

91
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:26,917
 the first resurrection

92
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:31,106
19 And now behold, I, the Lord, say unto you that

93
00:08:31,106 --> 00:08:35,773
 ye are not justified, because these things are

94
00:08:35,773 --> 00:08:40,44
 among you

95
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:44,937
20 Nevertheless, he that endureth in faith and

96
00:08:44,937 --> 00:08:49,437
 doeth my will, the same shall overcome, and shall

97
00:08:49,437 --> 00:08:53,937
 receive an inheritance upon the earth when the day of

98
00:08:53,937 --> 00:08:58,437
 transfiguration shall come

99
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:03,722
21 When the earth shall be transfigured, even

100
00:09:03,722 --> 00:09:08,472
 according to the pattern which was shown unto mine

101
00:09:08,472 --> 00:09:13,222
 apostles upon the mount; of which account the fulness

102
00:09:13,222 --> 00:09:17,972
 ye have not yet received

103
00:09:17,774 --> 00:09:22,774
22 And now, verily I say unto you, that as I said

104
00:09:22,774 --> 00:09:27,774
 that I would make known my will unto you, behold I

105
00:09:27,774 --> 00:09:32,774
 will make it known unto you, not by the way of

106
00:09:32,774 --> 00:09:37,774
 commandment, for there are many who observe not to

107
00:09:37,774 --> 00:09:42,774
 keep my commandments

108
00:09:42,065 --> 00:09:49,315
23 But unto him that keepeth my commandments I

109
00:09:49,315 --> 00:09:56,565
 will give the mysteries of my kingdom, and the same

110
00:09:56,565 --> 00:10:03,815
 shall be in him a well of living water, springing

111
00:10:03,815 --> 00:10:11,065
 up unto everlasting life

112
00:10:11,06 --> 00:10:15,86
24 And now, behold, this is the will of the Lord

113
00:10:15,86 --> 00:10:20,66
 your God concerning his saints, that they should

114
00:10:20,66 --> 00:10:25,46
 assemble themselves together unto the land of Zion,

115
00:10:25,46 --> 00:10:30,26
 not in haste, lest there should be confusion,

116
00:10:30,26 --> 00:10:35,06
 which bringeth pestilence

117
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:39,368
25 Behold, the land of Zion—I, the Lord, hold it

118
00:10:39,368 --> 00:10:43,368
 in mine own hands

119
00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:48,859
26 Nevertheless, I, the Lord, render unto Cæsar

120
00:10:48,859 --> 00:10:54,359
 the things which are Cæsar’s

121
00:10:54,871 --> 00:11:01,121
27 Wherefore, I the Lord will that you should

122
00:11:01,121 --> 00:11:07,371
 purchase the lands, that you may have advantage of the

123
00:11:07,371 --> 00:11:13,621
 world, that you may have claim on the world, that

124
00:11:13,621 --> 00:11:19,871
 they may not be stirred up unto anger

125
00:11:19,395 --> 00:11:25,395
28 For Satan putteth it into their hearts to anger

126
00:11:25,395 --> 00:11:31,395
 against you, and to the shedding of blood

127
00:11:31,474 --> 00:11:36,474
29 Wherefore, the land of Zion shall not be

128
00:11:36,474 --> 00:11:41,474
 obtained but by purchase or by blood, otherwise there is

129
00:11:41,474 --> 00:11:46,474
 none inheritance for you

130
00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:50,589
30 And if by purchase, behold you are blessed

131
00:11:50,894 --> 00:11:57,494
31 And if by blood, as you are forbidden to shed

132
00:11:57,494 --> 00:12:04,094
 blood, lo, your enemies are upon you, and ye shall

133
00:12:04,094 --> 00:12:10,694
 be scourged from city to city, and from synagogue

134
00:12:10,694 --> 00:12:17,294
 to synagogue, and but few shall stand to receive

135
00:12:17,294 --> 00:12:23,894
 an inheritance

136
00:12:23,426 --> 00:12:28,426
32 I, the Lord, am angry with the wicked; I am

137
00:12:28,426 --> 00:12:33,426
 holding my Spirit from the inhabitants of the earth

138
00:12:33,72 --> 00:12:40,387
33 I have sworn in my wrath, and decreed wars upon

139
00:12:40,387 --> 00:12:47,054
 the face of the earth, and the wicked shall slay

140
00:12:47,054 --> 00:12:53,721
 the wicked, and fear shall come upon every man

141
00:12:53,723 --> 00:12:58,723
34 And the saints also shall hardly escape;

142
00:12:58,723 --> 00:13:03,723
 nevertheless, I, the Lord, am with them, and will come

143
00:13:03,723 --> 00:13:08,723
 down in heaven from the presence of my Father and

144
00:13:08,723 --> 00:13:13,723
 consume the wicked with unquenchable fire

145
00:13:13,476 --> 00:13:21,476
35 And behold, this is not yet, but by and by

146
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:26,217
36 Wherefore, seeing that I, the Lord, have

147
00:13:26,217 --> 00:13:30,967
 decreed all these things upon the face of the earth, I

148
00:13:30,967 --> 00:13:35,717
 will that my saints should be assembled upon the

149
00:13:35,717 --> 00:13:40,467
 land of Zion

150
00:13:40,97 --> 00:13:47,17
37 And that every man should take righteousness in

151
00:13:47,17 --> 00:13:53,37
 his hands and faithfulness upon his loins, and

152
00:13:53,37 --> 00:13:59,57
 lift a warning voice unto the inhabitants of the

153
00:13:59,57 --> 00:14:05,77
 earth; and declare both by word and by flight that

154
00:14:05,77 --> 00:14:11,97
 desolation shall come upon the wicked

155
00:14:11,234 --> 00:14:15,567
38 Wherefore, let my disciples in Kirtland arrange

156
00:14:15,567 --> 00:14:19,9
 their temporal concerns, who dwell upon this

157
00:14:19,9 --> 00:14:24,233
 farm

158
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:30,14
39 Let my servant Titus Billings, who has the care

159
00:14:30,14 --> 00:14:35,283
 thereof, dispose of the land, that he may be

160
00:14:35,283 --> 00:14:40,426
 prepared in the coming spring to take his journey up

161
00:14:40,426 --> 00:14:45,569
 unto the land of Zion, with those that dwell upon

162
00:14:45,569 --> 00:14:50,712
 the face thereof, excepting those whom I shall

163
00:14:50,712 --> 00:14:55,855
 reserve unto myself, that shall not go until I shall

164
00:14:55,855 --> 00:15:00,998
 command them

165
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:05,733
40 And let all the moneys which can be spared, it

166
00:15:05,733 --> 00:15:10,983
 mattereth not unto me whether it be little or

167
00:15:10,983 --> 00:15:16,233
 much, be sent up unto the land of Zion, unto them whom

168
00:15:16,233 --> 00:15:21,483
 I have appointed to receive

169
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:26,454
41 Behold, I, the Lord, will give unto my servant

170
00:15:26,454 --> 00:15:31,654
 Joseph Smith, Jun., power that he shall be enabled

171
00:15:31,654 --> 00:15:36,854
 to discern by the Spirit those who shall go up

172
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:42,054
 unto the land of Zion, and those of my disciples who

173
00:15:42,054 --> 00:15:47,254
 shall tarry

174
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:51,913
42 Let my servant Newel K. Whitney retain his

175
00:15:51,913 --> 00:15:56,58
 store, or in other words, the store, yet for a little

176
00:15:56,58 --> 00:16:01,247
 season

177
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:04,86
43 Nevertheless, let him impart all the money

178
00:16:04,86 --> 00:16:08,193
 which he can impart, to be sent up unto the land of

179
00:16:08,193 --> 00:16:11,526
 Zion

180
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:15,537
44 Behold, these things are in his own hands, let

181
00:16:15,537 --> 00:16:19,537
 him do according to wisdom

182
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:23,712
45 Verily I say, let him be ordained as an agent

183
00:16:23,712 --> 00:16:28,379
 unto the disciples that shall tarry, and let him be

184
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:33,046
 ordained unto this power

185
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:39,059
46 And now speedily visit the churches, expounding

186
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:44,559
 these things unto them, with my servant Oliver

187
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:50,059
 Cowdery. Behold, this is my will, obtaining moneys

188
00:16:50,059 --> 00:16:55,559
 even as I have directed

189
00:16:55,831 --> 00:16:59,331
47 He that is faithful and endureth shall overcome

190
00:16:59,331 --> 00:17:02,831
 the world

191
00:17:02,838 --> 00:17:08,838
48 He that sendeth up treasures unto the land of

192
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:14,838
 Zion shall receive an inheritance in this world,

193
00:17:14,838 --> 00:17:20,838
 and his works shall follow him, and also a reward in

194
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:26,838
 the world to come

195
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:32,412
49 Yea, and blessed are the dead that die in the

196
00:17:32,412 --> 00:17:38,245
 Lord, from henceforth, when the Lord shall come,

197
00:17:38,245 --> 00:17:44,078
 and old things shall pass away, and all things

198
00:17:44,078 --> 00:17:49,911
 become new, they shall rise from the dead and shall not

199
00:17:49,911 --> 00:17:55,744
 die after, and shall receive an inheritance

200
00:17:55,744 --> 00:18:01,577
 before the Lord, in the holy city

201
00:18:01,564 --> 00:18:05,564
50 And he that liveth when the Lord shall come,

202
00:18:05,564 --> 00:18:09,564
 and hath kept the faith, blessed is he;

203
00:18:09,564 --> 00:18:13,564
 nevertheless, it is appointed to him to die at the age of man

204
00:18:13,564 --> 00:18:17,564


205
00:18:17,546 --> 00:18:25,546
51 Wherefore, children shall grow up until they

206
00:18:25,546 --> 00:18:33,546
 become old; old men shall die; but they shall not

207
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:41,546
 sleep in the dust, but they shall be changed in the

208
00:18:41,546 --> 00:18:49,546
 twinkling of an eye

209
00:18:49,512 --> 00:18:49,512
52 Wherefore, for this cause preached the apostles

210
00:18:49,512 --> 00:18:49,512
 unto the world the resurrection of the dead

211
00:18:49,845 --> 00:18:55,345
53 These things are the things that ye must look

212
00:18:55,345 --> 00:19:00,845
 for; and, speaking after the manner of the Lord,

213
00:19:00,845 --> 00:19:06,345
 they are now nigh at hand, and in a time to come,

214
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:11,845
 even in the day of the coming of the Son of Man

215
00:19:11,6 --> 00:19:18,6
54 And until that hour there will be foolish

216
00:19:18,6 --> 00:19:25,6
 virgins among the wise; and at that hour cometh an

217
00:19:25,6 --> 00:19:32,6
 entire separation of the righteous and the wicked; and

218
00:19:32,6 --> 00:19:39,6
 in that day will I send mine angels to pluck out

219
00:19:39,6 --> 00:19:46,6
 the wicked and cast them into unquenchable fire

220
00:19:46,902 --> 00:19:58,902
55 And now behold, verily I say unto you, I, the

221
00:19:58,902 --> 00:20:10,902
 Lord, am not pleased with my servant Sidney Rigdon;

222
00:20:10,902 --> 00:20:22,902
 he exalted himself in his heart, and received not

223
00:20:22,902 --> 00:20:34,902
 counsel, but grieved the Spirit

224
00:20:34,85 --> 00:20:35,1
56 Wherefore his writing is not acceptable unto

225
00:20:35,1 --> 00:20:35,35
 the Lord, and he shall make another; and if the Lord

226
00:20:35,35 --> 00:20:35,6
 receive it not, behold he standeth no longer in

227
00:20:35,6 --> 00:20:35,85
 the office to which I have appointed him

228
00:20:35,184 --> 00:20:38,434
57 And again, verily I say unto you, those who

229
00:20:38,434 --> 00:20:41,684
 desire in their hearts, in meekness, to warn sinners

230
00:20:41,684 --> 00:20:44,934
 to repentance, let them be ordained unto this

231
00:20:44,934 --> 00:20:48,184
 power

232
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:54,281
58 For this is a day of warning, and not a day of

233
00:20:54,281 --> 00:20:59,614
 many words. For I, the Lord, am not to be mocked

234
00:20:59,614 --> 00:21:04,947
 in the last days

235
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:10,697
59 Behold, I am from above, and my power lieth

236
00:21:10,697 --> 00:21:16,697
 beneath. I am over all, and in all, and through all,

237
00:21:16,697 --> 00:21:22,697
 and search all things, and the day cometh that all

238
00:21:22,697 --> 00:21:28,697
 things shall be subject unto me

239
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:31,354
60 Behold, I am Alpha and Omega, even Jesus

240
00:21:31,354 --> 00:21:34,354
 Christ

241
00:21:34,36 --> 00:21:38,86
61 Wherefore, let all men beware how they take my

242
00:21:38,86 --> 00:21:43,36
 name in their lips

243
00:21:43,853 --> 00:21:48,603
62 For behold, verily I say, that many there be

244
00:21:48,603 --> 00:21:53,353
 who are under this condemnation, who use the name of

245
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:58,103
 the Lord, and use it in vain, having not

246
00:21:58,103 --> 00:22:02,853
 authority

247
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:06,988
63 Wherefore, let the church repent of their sins,

248
00:22:06,988 --> 00:22:11,321
 and I, the Lord, will own them; otherwise they

249
00:22:11,321 --> 00:22:15,654
 shall be cut off

250
00:22:15,184 --> 00:22:20,351
64 Remember that that which cometh from above is

251
00:22:20,351 --> 00:22:25,518
 sacred, and must be spoken with care, and by

252
00:22:25,518 --> 00:22:30,685
 constraint of the Spirit; and in this there is no

253
00:22:30,685 --> 00:22:35,852
 condemnation, and ye receive the Spirit through prayer;

254
00:22:35,852 --> 00:22:41,019
 wherefore, without this there remaineth

255
00:22:41,019 --> 00:22:46,186
 condemnation

256
00:22:46,215 --> 00:22:52,548
65 Let my servants, Joseph Smith, Jun., and Sidney

257
00:22:52,548 --> 00:22:58,881
 Rigdon, seek them a home, as they are taught

258
00:22:58,881 --> 00:23:05,214
 through prayer by the Spirit

259
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:12,718
66 These things remain to overcome through

260
00:23:12,718 --> 00:23:19,718
 patience, that such may receive a more exceeding and

261
00:23:19,718 --> 00:23:26,718
 eternal weight of glory, otherwise, a greater

262
00:23:26,718 --> 00:23:33,718
 condemnation. Amen.
