00:00:16,3 --> 00:00:23,391
Section 66 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:23,391 --> 00:00:30,482
 the Prophet, at Hiram, Ohio, October 29, 1831.

3
00:00:30,482 --> 00:00:37,573
 William E. McLellin had petitioned the Lord in secret

4
00:00:37,573 --> 00:00:44,664
 to make known through the Prophet the answer to

5
00:00:44,664 --> 00:00:51,755
 five questions, which were unknown to Joseph Smith.

6
00:00:51,755 --> 00:00:58,846
 At McLellin’s request, the Prophet inquired of the

7
00:00:58,846 --> 00:01:05,937
 Lord and received this revelation. 
1–4, The

8
00:01:05,937 --> 00:01:13,028
 everlasting covenant is the fulness of the gospel;

9
00:01:13,028 --> 00:01:20,119
5–8, Elders are to preach, testify, and reason with

10
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:27,21
 the people; 
9–13, Faithful ministerial service

11
00:01:27,21 --> 00:01:34,301
 ensures an inheritance of eternal life.

12
00:01:34,911 --> 00:01:40,411
1 Behold, thus saith the Lord unto my servant

13
00:01:40,411 --> 00:01:45,911
 William E. McLellin—Blessed are you, inasmuch as you

14
00:01:45,911 --> 00:01:51,411
 have turned away from your iniquities, and have

15
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:56,911
 received my truths, saith the Lord your Redeemer, the

16
00:01:56,911 --> 00:02:02,411
 Savior of the world, even of as many as believe

17
00:02:02,411 --> 00:02:07,911
 on my name

18
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:13,57
2 Verily I say unto you, blessed are you for

19
00:02:13,57 --> 00:02:19,713
 receiving mine everlasting covenant, even the fulness

20
00:02:19,713 --> 00:02:25,856
 of my gospel, sent forth unto the children of men,

21
00:02:25,856 --> 00:02:31,999
 that they might have life and be made partakers of

22
00:02:31,999 --> 00:02:38,142
 the glories which are to be revealed in the last

23
00:02:38,142 --> 00:02:44,285
 days, as it was written by the prophets and

24
00:02:44,285 --> 00:02:50,428
 apostles in days of old

25
00:02:50,42 --> 00:02:56,02
3 Verily I say unto you, my servant William, that

26
00:02:56,02 --> 00:03:01,62
 you are clean, but not all; repent, therefore, of

27
00:03:01,62 --> 00:03:07,22
 those things which are not pleasing in my sight,

28
00:03:07,22 --> 00:03:12,82
 saith the Lord, for the Lord will show them unto

29
00:03:12,82 --> 00:03:18,42
 you

30
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:23,165
4 And now, verily, I, the Lord, will show unto you

31
00:03:23,165 --> 00:03:28,165
 what I will concerning you, or what is my will

32
00:03:28,165 --> 00:03:33,165
 concerning you

33
00:03:33,663 --> 00:03:40,413
5 Behold, verily I say unto you, that it is my

34
00:03:40,413 --> 00:03:47,163
 will that you should proclaim my gospel from land to

35
00:03:47,163 --> 00:03:53,913
 land, and from city to city, yea, in those regions

36
00:03:53,913 --> 00:04:00,663
 round about where it has not been proclaimed

37
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:05,673
6 Tarry not many days in this place; go not up

38
00:04:05,673 --> 00:04:11,173
 unto the land of Zion as yet; but inasmuch as you can

39
00:04:11,173 --> 00:04:16,673
 send, send; otherwise, think not of thy property

40
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:22,173


41
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:31,663
7 Go unto the eastern lands, bear testimony in

42
00:04:31,663 --> 00:04:40,33
 every place, unto every people and in their

43
00:04:40,33 --> 00:04:48,997
 synagogues, reasoning with the people

44
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:56,989
8 Let my servant Samuel H. Smith go with you, and

45
00:04:56,989 --> 00:05:04,989
 forsake him not, and give him thine instructions;

46
00:05:04,989 --> 00:05:12,989
 and he that is faithful shall be made strong in

47
00:05:12,989 --> 00:05:20,989
 every place; and I, the Lord, will go with you

48
00:05:20,72 --> 00:05:28,97
9 Lay your hands upon the sick, and they shall

49
00:05:28,97 --> 00:05:37,22
 recover. Return not till I, the Lord, shall send you.

50
00:05:37,22 --> 00:05:45,47
 Be patient in affliction. Ask, and ye shall

51
00:05:45,47 --> 00:05:53,72
 receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you

52
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:59,72
10 Seek not to be cumbered. Forsake all

53
00:05:59,72 --> 00:06:06,387
 unrighteousness. Commit not adultery—a temptation with which

54
00:06:06,387 --> 00:06:13,054
 thou hast been troubled

55
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:19,289
11 Keep these sayings, for they are true and

56
00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:25,539
 faithful; and thou shalt magnify thine office, and push

57
00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:31,789
 many people to Zion with songs of everlasting joy

58
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:38,039
 upon their heads

59
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:45,315
12 Continue in these things even unto the end, and

60
00:06:45,315 --> 00:06:52,315
 you shall have a crown of eternal life at the

61
00:06:52,315 --> 00:06:59,315
 right hand of my Father, who is full of grace and

62
00:06:59,315 --> 00:07:06,315
 truth

63
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:11,793
13 Verily, thus saith the Lord your God, your

64
00:07:11,793 --> 00:07:17,293
 Redeemer, even Jesus Christ. Amen.
