00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 66 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Prophet, at Hiram, Ohio, October 29, 1831.

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
William E. McLellin had petitioned the Lord in

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
secret to make known through the Prophet the

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
answer to five questions, which were unknown to

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Joseph Smith. At McLellin’s request, the Prophet

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
inquired of the Lord and received this revelation.

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
1–4, The everlasting covenant is the fulness of

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the gospel; 
5–8, Elders are to preach,

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
testify, and reason with the people; 
9–13, Faithful

11
00:00:00,0 --> 01:33:54,
ministerial service ensures an inheritance of eternal life. 

12
01:33:54,0 --> 01:33:54,0
1 Behold, thus saith the Lord unto my

13
01:33:54,0 --> 01:33:54,0
servant William E. McLellin—Blessed are you,

14
01:33:54,0 --> 01:33:54,0
inasmuch as you have turned away from your

15
01:33:54,0 --> 01:33:54,0
iniquities, and have received my truths, saith

16
01:33:54,0 --> 01:33:54,0
the Lord your Redeemer, the Savior of the

17
01:33:54,0 --> 02:04:54,
world, even of as many as believe on my name.

18
02:04:54,0 --> 02:04:54,0
2 Verily I say unto you, blessed are

19
02:04:54,0 --> 02:04:54,0
you for receiving mine everlasting

20
02:04:54,0 --> 02:04:54,0
covenant, even the fulness of my gospel, sent

21
02:04:54,0 --> 02:04:54,0
forth unto the children of men, that

22
02:04:54,0 --> 02:04:54,0
they might have life and be made

23
02:04:54,0 --> 02:04:54,0
partakers of the glories which are to be

24
02:04:54,0 --> 02:04:54,0
revealed in the last days, as it was written

25
02:04:54,0 --> 02:05:58,
by the prophets and apostles in days of old.

26
02:05:58,0 --> 02:05:58,0
3 Verily I say unto you, my

27
02:05:58,0 --> 02:05:58,0
servant William, that you are clean,

28
02:05:58,0 --> 02:05:58,0
but not all; repent, therefore, of

29
02:05:58,0 --> 02:05:58,0
those things which are not

30
02:05:58,0 --> 02:05:58,0
pleasing in my sight, saith the Lord,

31
02:05:58,0 --> 02:50:00,
for the Lord will show them unto you.

32
02:50:00,0 --> 02:50:00,0
4 And now, verily, I, the

33
02:50:00,0 --> 02:50:00,0
Lord, will show unto you what

34
02:50:00,0 --> 02:50:00,0
I will concerning you, or

35
02:50:00,0 --> 03:17:36,
what is my will concerning you.

36
03:17:36,0 --> 03:17:36,0
5 Behold, verily I say unto

37
03:17:36,0 --> 03:17:36,0
you, that it is my will that

38
03:17:36,0 --> 03:17:36,0
you should proclaim my

39
03:17:36,0 --> 03:17:36,0
gospel from land to land, and

40
03:17:36,0 --> 03:17:36,0
from city to city, yea, in

41
03:17:36,0 --> 03:17:36,0
those regions round about where

42
03:17:36,0 --> 03:32:38,
it has not been proclaimed.

43
03:32:38,0 --> 03:32:38,0
6 Tarry not many days in

44
03:32:38,0 --> 03:32:38,0
this place; go not up

45
03:32:38,0 --> 03:32:38,0
unto the land of Zion as

46
03:32:38,0 --> 03:32:38,0
yet; but inasmuch as you can

47
03:32:38,0 --> 03:32:38,0
send, send; otherwise,

48
03:32:38,0 --> 03:59:37,
think not of thy property.

49
03:59:37,0 --> 03:59:37,0
7 Go unto the eastern

50
03:59:37,0 --> 03:59:37,0
lands, bear

51
03:59:37,0 --> 03:59:37,0
testimony in every place,

52
03:59:37,0 --> 03:59:37,0
unto every people and in

53
03:59:37,0 --> 03:59:37,0
their synagogues,

54
03:59:37,0 --> 04:21:40,
reasoning with the people.

55
04:21:40,0 --> 04:21:40,0
8 Let my servant

56
04:21:40,0 --> 04:21:40,0
Samuel H. Smith go

57
04:21:40,0 --> 04:21:40,0
with you, and forsake

58
04:21:40,0 --> 04:21:40,0
him not, and give

59
04:21:40,0 --> 04:21:40,0
him thine

60
04:21:40,0 --> 04:21:40,0
instructions; and he that is

61
04:21:40,0 --> 04:21:40,0
faithful shall be

62
04:21:40,0 --> 04:21:40,0
made strong in

63
04:21:40,0 --> 04:21:40,0
every place; and I, the

64
04:21:40,0 --> 04:48:11,
Lord, will go with you.

65
04:48:11,0 --> 04:48:11,0
9 Lay your hands

66
04:48:11,0 --> 04:48:11,0
upon the sick,

67
04:48:11,0 --> 04:48:11,0
and they shall

68
04:48:11,0 --> 04:48:11,0
recover. Return not

69
04:48:11,0 --> 04:48:11,0
till I, the Lord,

70
04:48:11,0 --> 04:48:11,0
shall send you.

71
04:48:11,0 --> 04:48:11,0
Be patient in

72
04:48:11,0 --> 04:48:11,0
affliction. Ask, and

73
04:48:11,0 --> 04:48:11,0
ye shall receive;

74
04:48:11,0 --> 04:48:11,0
knock, and it

75
04:48:11,0 --> 05:19:11,
shall be opened unto you.

76
05:19:11,0 --> 05:19:11,0
10 Seek not to

77
05:19:11,0 --> 05:19:11,0
be cumbered.

78
05:19:11,0 --> 05:19:11,0
Forsake all

79
05:19:11,0 --> 05:19:11,0
unrighteousness.

80
05:19:11,0 --> 05:19:11,0
Commit not

81
05:19:11,0 --> 05:19:11,0
adultery—a temptation

82
05:19:11,0 --> 05:19:11,0
with which thou

83
05:19:11,0 --> 05:52:11,
hast been troubled.

84
05:52:11,0 --> 05:52:11,0
11 Keep these

85
05:52:11,0 --> 05:52:11,0
sayings, for

86
05:52:11,0 --> 05:52:11,0
they are true

87
05:52:11,0 --> 05:52:11,0
and faithful;

88
05:52:11,0 --> 05:52:11,0
and thou shalt

89
05:52:11,0 --> 05:52:11,0
magnify thine

90
05:52:11,0 --> 05:52:11,0
office, and

91
05:52:11,0 --> 05:52:11,0
push many people

92
05:52:11,0 --> 05:52:11,0
to Zion with

93
05:52:11,0 --> 05:52:11,0
songs of

94
05:52:11,0 --> 05:52:11,0
everlasting joy

95
05:52:11,0 --> 06:11:10,
upon their heads.

96
06:11:10,0 --> 06:11:10,0
12 Continue

97
06:11:10,0 --> 06:11:10,0
in these

98
06:11:10,0 --> 06:11:10,0
things even unto

99
06:11:10,0 --> 06:11:10,0
the end, and

100
06:11:10,0 --> 06:11:10,0
you shall have

101
06:11:10,0 --> 06:11:10,0
a crown of

102
06:11:10,0 --> 06:11:10,0
eternal life

103
06:11:10,0 --> 06:11:10,0
at the right

104
06:11:10,0 --> 06:11:10,0
hand of my

105
06:11:10,0 --> 06:11:10,0
Father, who is

106
06:11:10,0 --> 06:37:11,
full of grace and truth.

107
06:37:11,0 --> 06:37:11,0
13 Verily,

108
06:37:11,0 --> 06:37:11,0
thus saith

109
06:37:11,0 --> 06:37:11,0
the Lord

110
06:37:11,0 --> 06:37:11,0
your God,

111
06:37:11,0 --> 06:37:11,0
your Redeemer,

112
06:37:11,0 --> 06:37:11,0
even Jesus

113
06:37:11,0 --> 06:44:13,
Christ. Amen.
