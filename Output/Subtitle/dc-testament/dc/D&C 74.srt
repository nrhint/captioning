1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 74 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Prophet, at Wayne County, New York, in 1830. Even

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
before the organization of the Church, questions

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
had arisen about the proper mode of baptism,

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
leading the Prophet to seek answers on the subject.

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Joseph Smith’s history states that this revelation

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
is an explanation of 
1 Corinthians 7:14, a

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
scripture that had often been used to justify infant

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
baptism. 
1–5, Paul counsels the Church of his

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
day not to keep the law of Moses; 
6–7, Little

11
00:00:00,0 --> 01:34:52,
children are holy and are sanctified through the Atonement. 

12
01:34:52,0 --> 01:34:52,0
1 For the unbelieving husband is

13
01:34:52,0 --> 01:34:52,0
sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife

14
01:34:52,0 --> 01:34:52,0
is sanctified by the husband; else were

15
01:34:52,0 --> 02:01:51,
your children unclean, but now are they holy.

16
02:01:51,0 --> 02:01:51,0
2 Now, in the days of the

17
02:01:51,0 --> 02:01:51,0
apostles the law of circumcision was

18
02:01:51,0 --> 02:01:51,0
had among all the Jews who

19
02:01:51,0 --> 02:15:55,
believed not the gospel of Jesus Christ.

20
02:15:55,0 --> 02:15:55,0
3 And it came to pass that there

21
02:15:55,0 --> 02:15:55,0
arose a great contention among

22
02:15:55,0 --> 02:15:55,0
the people concerning the law of

23
02:15:55,0 --> 02:15:55,0
circumcision, for the

24
02:15:55,0 --> 02:15:55,0
unbelieving husband was desirous that his

25
02:15:55,0 --> 02:15:55,0
children should be circumcised

26
02:15:55,0 --> 02:15:55,0
and become subject to the law of

27
02:15:55,0 --> 02:36:58,
Moses, which law was fulfilled.

28
02:36:58,0 --> 02:36:58,0
4 And it came to pass that

29
02:36:58,0 --> 02:36:58,0
the children, being brought up

30
02:36:58,0 --> 02:36:58,0
in subjection to the law of

31
02:36:58,0 --> 02:36:58,0
Moses, gave heed to the

32
02:36:58,0 --> 02:36:58,0
traditions of their fathers and

33
02:36:58,0 --> 02:36:58,0
believed not the gospel of

34
02:36:58,0 --> 02:58:01,
Christ, wherein they became unholy.

35
02:58:01,0 --> 02:58:01,0
5 Wherefore, for this

36
02:58:01,0 --> 02:58:01,0
cause the apostle wrote unto

37
02:58:01,0 --> 02:58:01,0
the church, giving unto

38
02:58:01,0 --> 02:58:01,0
them a commandment, not of

39
02:58:01,0 --> 02:58:01,0
the Lord, but of himself,

40
02:58:01,0 --> 02:58:01,0
that a believer should not

41
02:58:01,0 --> 02:58:01,0
be united to an unbeliever;

42
02:58:01,0 --> 02:58:01,0
except the law of Moses

43
02:58:01,0 --> 03:29:01,
should be done away among them,

44
03:29:01,0 --> 03:29:01,0
6 That their children

45
03:29:01,0 --> 03:29:01,0
might remain without

46
03:29:01,0 --> 03:29:01,0
circumcision; and that the

47
03:29:01,0 --> 03:29:01,0
tradition might be done away,

48
03:29:01,0 --> 03:29:01,0
which saith that little

49
03:29:01,0 --> 03:29:01,0
children are unholy; for

50
03:29:01,0 --> 03:30:05,
it was had among the Jews;

51
03:30:05,0 --> 03:30:05,0
7 But little children

52
03:30:05,0 --> 03:30:05,0
are holy, being

53
03:30:05,0 --> 03:30:05,0
sanctified through the

54
03:30:05,0 --> 03:30:05,0
atonement of Jesus

55
03:30:05,0 --> 03:30:05,0
Christ; and this is what

56
03:30:05,0 --> 03:41:05,
the scriptures mean.
