1
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:18,914
Section 74 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:18,914 --> 00:00:26,55
 Prophet, at Wayne County, New York, in 1830. Even

3
00:00:26,55 --> 00:00:34,186
 before the organization of the Church, questions had

4
00:00:34,186 --> 00:00:41,822
 arisen about the proper mode of baptism, leading

5
00:00:41,822 --> 00:00:49,458
 the Prophet to seek answers on the subject. Joseph

6
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:57,094
 Smith’s history states that this revelation is an

7
00:00:57,094 --> 00:01:04,73
 explanation of 
1 Corinthians 7:14, a scripture

8
00:01:04,73 --> 00:01:12,366
 that had often been used to justify infant baptism.

9
00:01:12,366 --> 00:01:20,002
1–5, Paul counsels the Church of his day not to

10
00:01:20,002 --> 00:01:27,638
 keep the law of Moses; 
6–7, Little children are

11
00:01:27,638 --> 00:01:35,274
 holy and are sanctified through the Atonement.

12
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:41,928
1 For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the

13
00:01:41,928 --> 00:01:48,678
 wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by

14
00:01:48,678 --> 00:01:55,428
 the husband; else were your children unclean, but

15
00:01:55,428 --> 00:02:02,178
 now are they holy

16
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:07,356
2 Now, in the days of the apostles the law of

17
00:02:07,356 --> 00:02:12,023
 circumcision was had among all the Jews who believed

18
00:02:12,023 --> 00:02:16,69
 not the gospel of Jesus Christ

19
00:02:16,97 --> 00:02:20,637
3 And it came to pass that there arose a great

20
00:02:20,637 --> 00:02:24,304
 contention among the people concerning the law of

21
00:02:24,304 --> 00:02:27,971
 circumcision, for the unbelieving husband was

22
00:02:27,971 --> 00:02:31,638
 desirous that his children should be circumcised and

23
00:02:31,638 --> 00:02:35,305
 become subject to the law of Moses, which law was

24
00:02:35,305 --> 00:02:38,972
 fulfilled

25
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:42,441
4 And it came to pass that the children, being

26
00:02:42,441 --> 00:02:46,641
 brought up in subjection to the law of Moses, gave

27
00:02:46,641 --> 00:02:50,841
 heed to the traditions of their fathers and believed

28
00:02:50,841 --> 00:02:55,041
 not the gospel of Christ, wherein they became

29
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:59,241
 unholy

30
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:05,679
5 Wherefore, for this cause the apostle wrote unto

31
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:12,079
 the church, giving unto them a commandment, not

32
00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:18,479
 of the Lord, but of himself, that a believer should

33
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:24,879
 not be united to an unbeliever; except the law of

34
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:31,279
 Moses should be done away among them

35
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:35,561
6 That their children might remain without

36
00:03:35,561 --> 00:03:39,561
 circumcision; and that the tradition might be done away,

37
00:03:39,561 --> 00:03:43,561
 which saith that little children are unholy; for

38
00:03:43,561 --> 00:03:47,561
 it was had among the Jews

39
00:03:47,31 --> 00:03:52,31
7 But little children are holy, being sanctified

40
00:03:52,31 --> 00:03:57,31
 through the atonement of Jesus Christ; and this is

41
00:03:57,31 --> 00:04:02,31
 what the scriptures mean.
