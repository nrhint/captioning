00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:19,226
The Doctrine and CovenantsSection 1 Revelation given through Joseph Smith 

2
00:00:19,226 --> 00:00:26,94
the Prophet, on November 1, 1831, during a special conference 

3
00:00:26,94 --> 00:00:34,654
of elders of the Church, held at Hiram, Ohio. Many 

4
00:00:34,654 --> 00:00:42,369
revelations had been received from the Lord prior to this 

5
00:00:42,369 --> 00:00:50,083
time, and the compilation of these for publication in book 

6
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:57,797
form was one of the principal subjects passed upon at 

7
00:00:57,797 --> 00:01:05,511
the conference. This section constitutes the Lord’s preface to the 

8
00:01:05,511 --> 00:01:13,226
doctrines, covenants, and commandments given in this dispensation. 
1–7, The 

9
00:01:13,226 --> 00:01:20,94
voice of warning is to all people; 
8–16, Apostasy and 

10
00:01:20,94 --> 00:01:28,654
wickedness precede the Second Coming; 
17–23, Joseph Smith is called 

11
00:01:28,654 --> 00:01:36,369
to restore to earth the Lord’s truths and powers; 
24–33, 

12
00:01:36,369 --> 00:01:44,083
The Book of Mormon is brought forth and the true 

13
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:51,797
Church is established; 
34–36, Peace will be taken from the 

14
00:01:51,797 --> 00:01:59,511
earth; 
37–39, Search these commandments.  

15
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:05,786
1 Hearken, O ye people of my church, saith the 

16
00:02:05,786 --> 00:02:12,186
voice of him who dwells on high, and whose eyes 

17
00:02:12,186 --> 00:02:18,586
are upon all men; yea, verily I say: Hearken ye 

18
00:02:18,586 --> 00:02:24,986
people from afar; and ye that are upon the islands 

19
00:02:24,986 --> 00:02:31,386
of the sea, listen together. 

20
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:38,601
2 For verily the voice of the Lord is unto 

21
00:02:38,601 --> 00:02:45,851
all men, and there is none to escape; and there 

22
00:02:45,851 --> 00:02:53,101
is no eye that shall not see, neither ear that 

23
00:02:53,101 --> 00:03:00,351
shall not hear, neither heart that shall not be penetrated. 

24
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:08,514
3 And the rebellious shall be pierced with much sorrow; 

25
00:03:08,514 --> 00:03:16,181
for their iniquities shall be spoken upon the housetops, and 

26
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:23,847
their secret acts shall be revealed. 

27
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:30,17
4 And the voice of warning shall be unto all 

28
00:03:30,17 --> 00:03:36,504
people, by the mouths of my disciples, whom I have 

29
00:03:36,504 --> 00:03:42,837
chosen in these last days. 

30
00:03:42,372 --> 00:03:50,372
5 And they shall go forth and none shall stay 

31
00:03:50,372 --> 00:03:58,372
them, for I the Lord have commanded them. 

32
00:03:58,355 --> 00:04:07,105
6 Behold, this is mine authority, and the authority of 

33
00:04:07,105 --> 00:04:15,855
my servants, and my preface unto the book of my 

34
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:24,605
commandments, which I have given them to publish unto you, 

35
00:04:24,605 --> 00:04:33,355
O inhabitants of the earth. 

36
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:42,356
7 Wherefore, fear and tremble, O ye people, for what 

37
00:04:42,356 --> 00:04:51,356
I the Lord have decreed in them shall be fulfilled. 

38
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:58,124
8 And verily I say unto you, that they who 

39
00:04:58,124 --> 00:05:04,874
go forth, bearing these tidings unto the inhabitants of the 

40
00:05:04,874 --> 00:05:11,624
earth, to them is power given to seal both on 

41
00:05:11,624 --> 00:05:18,374
earth and in heaven, the unbelieving and rebellious; 

42
00:05:18,869 --> 00:05:23,869
9 Yea, verily, to seal them up unto the day 

43
00:05:23,869 --> 00:05:28,869
when the wrath of God shall be poured out upon 

44
00:05:28,869 --> 00:05:33,869
the wicked without measure— 

45
00:05:33,4 --> 00:05:41,9
10 Unto the day when the Lord shall come to 

46
00:05:41,9 --> 00:05:50,4
recompense unto every man according to his work, and measure 

47
00:05:50,4 --> 00:05:58,9
to every man according to the measure which he has 

48
00:05:58,9 --> 00:06:07,4
measured to his fellow man. 

49
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:12,901
11 Wherefore the voice of the Lord is unto the 

50
00:06:12,901 --> 00:06:17,901
ends of the earth, that all that will hear may 

51
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:22,901
hear: 

52
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:28,449
12 Prepare ye, prepare ye for that which is to 

53
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:33,949
come, for the Lord is nigh; 

54
00:06:33,96 --> 00:06:39,294
13 And the anger of the Lord is kindled, and 

55
00:06:39,294 --> 00:06:44,627
his sword is bathed in heaven, and it shall fall 

56
00:06:44,627 --> 00:06:49,96
upon the inhabitants of the earth. 

57
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:57,059
14 And the arm of the Lord shall be revealed; 

58
00:06:57,059 --> 00:07:04,659
and the day cometh that they who will not hear 

59
00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:12,259
the voice of the Lord, neither the voice of his 

60
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:19,859
servants, neither give heed to the words of the prophets 

61
00:07:19,859 --> 00:07:27,459
and apostles, shall be cut off from among the people; 

62
00:07:27,43 --> 00:07:32,43
15 For they have strayed from mine ordinances, and have 

63
00:07:32,43 --> 00:07:37,43
broken mine everlasting covenant; 

64
00:07:37,44 --> 00:07:45,107
16 They seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, 

65
00:07:45,107 --> 00:07:52,774
but every man walketh in his own way, and after 

66
00:07:52,774 --> 00:08:00,44
the image of his own god, whose image is in 

67
00:08:00,44 --> 00:08:08,107
the likeness of the world, and whose substance is that 

68
00:08:08,107 --> 00:08:15,774
of an idol, which waxeth old and shall perish in 

69
00:08:15,774 --> 00:08:23,44
Babylon, even Babylon the great, which shall fall. 

70
00:08:23,92 --> 00:08:29,67
17 Wherefore, I the Lord, knowing the calamity which should 

71
00:08:29,67 --> 00:08:35,42
come upon the inhabitants of the earth, called upon my 

72
00:08:35,42 --> 00:08:41,17
servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and spake unto him from heaven, 

73
00:08:41,17 --> 00:08:46,92
and gave him commandments; 

74
00:08:46,476 --> 00:08:55,143
18 And also gave commandments to others, that they should 

75
00:08:55,143 --> 00:09:03,809
proclaim these things unto the world; and all this that 

76
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:12,476
it might be fulfilled, which was written by the prophets— 

77
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:20,969
19 The weak things of the world shall come forth 

78
00:09:20,969 --> 00:09:29,469
and break down the mighty and strong ones, that man 

79
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:37,969
should not counsel his fellow man, neither trust in the 

80
00:09:37,969 --> 00:09:46,469
arm of flesh— 

81
00:09:46,469 --> 00:09:53,469
20 But that every man might speak in the name 

82
00:09:53,469 --> 00:10:00,469
of God the Lord, even the Savior of the world; 

83
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:07,517
21 That faith also might increase in the earth; 

84
00:10:07,54 --> 00:10:13,54
22 That mine everlasting covenant might be established; 

85
00:10:13,563 --> 00:10:20,563
23 That the fulness of my gospel might be proclaimed 

86
00:10:20,563 --> 00:10:27,563
by the weak and the simple unto the ends of 

87
00:10:27,563 --> 00:10:34,563
the world, and before kings and rulers. 

88
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:40,317
24 Behold, I am God and have spoken it; these 

89
00:10:40,317 --> 00:10:46,067
commandments are of me, and were given unto my servants 

90
00:10:46,067 --> 00:10:51,817
in their weakness, after the manner of their language, that 

91
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:57,567
they might come to understanding. 

92
00:10:57,557 --> 00:11:00,557
25 And inasmuch as they erred it might be made 

93
00:11:00,557 --> 00:11:03,557
known; 

94
00:11:03,213 --> 00:11:06,213
26 And inasmuch as they sought wisdom they might be 

95
00:11:06,213 --> 00:11:09,213
instructed; 

96
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:12,735
27 And inasmuch as they sinned they might be chastened, 

97
00:11:12,735 --> 00:11:16,235
that they might repent; 

98
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:20,909
28 And inasmuch as they were humble they might be 

99
00:11:20,909 --> 00:11:25,576
made strong, and blessed from on high, and receive knowledge 

100
00:11:25,576 --> 00:11:30,242
from time to time. 

101
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:35,273
29 And after having received the record of the Nephites, 

102
00:11:35,273 --> 00:11:40,273
yea, even my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., might have power 

103
00:11:40,273 --> 00:11:45,273
to translate through the mercy of God, by the power 

104
00:11:45,273 --> 00:11:50,273
of God, the Book of Mormon. 

105
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:56,562
30 And also those to whom these commandments were given, 

106
00:11:56,562 --> 00:12:02,848
might have power to lay the foundation of this church, 

107
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:09,133
and to bring it forth out of obscurity and out 

108
00:12:09,133 --> 00:12:15,419
of darkness, the only true and living church upon the 

109
00:12:15,419 --> 00:12:21,705
face of the whole earth, with which I, the Lord, 

110
00:12:21,705 --> 00:12:27,991
am well pleased, speaking unto the church collectively and not 

111
00:12:27,991 --> 00:12:34,276
individually— 

112
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:38,787
31 For I the Lord cannot look upon sin with 

113
00:12:38,787 --> 00:12:42,787
the least degree of allowance; 

114
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:47,295
32 Nevertheless, he that repents and does the commandments of 

115
00:12:47,295 --> 00:12:52,295
the Lord shall be forgiven; 

116
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:58,372
33 And he that repents not, from him shall be 

117
00:12:58,372 --> 00:13:03,872
taken even the light which he has received; for my 

118
00:13:03,872 --> 00:13:09,372
Spirit shall not always strive with man, saith the Lord 

119
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:14,872
of Hosts. 

120
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:20,044
34 And again, verily I say unto you, O inhabitants 

121
00:13:20,044 --> 00:13:25,71
of the earth: I the Lord am willing to make 

122
00:13:25,71 --> 00:13:31,377
these things known unto all flesh; 

123
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:36,611
35 For I am no respecter of persons, and will 

124
00:13:36,611 --> 00:13:41,811
that all men shall know that the day speedily cometh; 

125
00:13:41,811 --> 00:13:47,011
the hour is not yet, but is nigh at hand, 

126
00:13:47,011 --> 00:13:52,211
when peace shall be taken from the earth, and the 

127
00:13:52,211 --> 00:13:57,411
devil shall have power over his own dominion. 

128
00:13:57,92 --> 00:14:04,587
36 And also the Lord shall have power over his 

129
00:14:04,587 --> 00:14:11,254
saints, and shall reign in their midst, and shall come 

130
00:14:11,254 --> 00:14:17,92
down in judgment upon Idumea, or the world. 

131
00:14:17,907 --> 00:14:25,24
37 Search these commandments, for they are true and faithful, 

132
00:14:25,24 --> 00:14:32,574
and the prophecies and promises which are in them shall 

133
00:14:32,574 --> 00:14:39,907
all be fulfilled. 

134
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:44,912
38 What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, 

135
00:14:44,912 --> 00:14:50,412
and I excuse not myself; and though the heavens and 

136
00:14:50,412 --> 00:14:55,912
the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away, 

137
00:14:55,912 --> 00:15:01,412
but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice 

138
00:15:01,412 --> 00:15:06,912
or by the voice of my servants, it is the 

139
00:15:06,912 --> 00:15:12,412
same. 

140
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,579
39 For behold, and lo, the Lord is God, and 

141
00:15:15,579 --> 00:15:18,245
the Spirit beareth record, and the record is true, and 

142
00:15:18,245 --> 00:15:20,912
the truth abideth forever and ever. Amen.
