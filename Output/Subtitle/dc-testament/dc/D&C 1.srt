00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:19,226
The Doctrine and CovenantsSection 1 Revelation given through Joseph Smith 

2
00:00:19,226 --> 00:00:26,94
the Prophet, on November 1, 1831, during a special conference 

3
00:00:26,94 --> 00:00:34,654
of elders of the Church, held at Hiram, Ohio. Many 

4
00:00:34,654 --> 00:00:42,367
revelations had been received from the Lord prior to this 

5
00:00:42,367 --> 00:00:50,081
time, and the compilation of these for publication in book 

6
00:00:50,081 --> 00:00:57,796
form was one of the principal subjects passed upon at 

7
00:00:57,796 --> 00:01:05,51
the conference. This section constitutes the Lord’s preface to the 

8
00:01:05,51 --> 00:01:13,224
doctrines, covenants, and commandments given in this dispensation. 
1–7, The 

9
00:01:13,224 --> 00:01:20,938
voice of warning is to all people; 
8–16, Apostasy and 

10
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:28,651
wickedness precede the Second Coming; 
17–23, Joseph Smith is called 

11
00:01:28,651 --> 00:01:36,365
to restore to earth the Lord’s truths and powers; 
24–33, 

12
00:01:36,365 --> 00:01:44,08
The Book of Mormon is brought forth and the true 

13
00:01:44,08 --> 00:01:51,794
Church is established; 
34–36, Peace will be taken from the 

14
00:01:51,794 --> 00:01:59,386
earth; 
37–39, Search these commandments.  

15
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:05,786
1 Hearken, O ye people of my church, saith the 

16
00:02:05,786 --> 00:02:12,186
voice of him who dwells on high, and whose eyes 

17
00:02:12,186 --> 00:02:18,586
are upon all men; yea, verily I say: Hearken ye 

18
00:02:18,586 --> 00:02:24,986
people from afar; and ye that are upon the islands 

19
00:02:24,986 --> 00:02:31,118
of the sea, listen together. 

20
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:38,368
2 For verily the voice of the Lord is unto 

21
00:02:38,368 --> 00:02:45,618
all men, and there is none to escape; and there 

22
00:02:45,618 --> 00:02:52,868
is no eye that shall not see, neither ear that 

23
00:02:52,868 --> 00:03:00,864
shall not hear, neither heart that shall not be penetrated. 

24
00:03:00,864 --> 00:03:08,531
3 And the rebellious shall be pierced with much sorrow; 

25
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:16,198
for their iniquities shall be spoken upon the housetops, and 

26
00:03:16,198 --> 00:03:23,62
their secret acts shall be revealed. 

27
00:03:23,62 --> 00:03:29,62
4 And the voice of warning shall be unto all 

28
00:03:29,62 --> 00:03:35,62
people, by the mouths of my disciples, whom I have 

29
00:03:35,62 --> 00:03:41,938
chosen in these last days. 

30
00:03:41,938 --> 00:03:50,438
5 And they shall go forth and none shall stay 

31
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:58,305
them, for I the Lord have commanded them. 

32
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:07,055
6 Behold, this is mine authority, and the authority of 

33
00:04:07,055 --> 00:04:15,805
my servants, and my preface unto the book of my 

34
00:04:15,805 --> 00:04:24,555
commandments, which I have given them to publish unto you, 

35
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:33,306
O inhabitants of the earth. 

36
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:42,306
7 Wherefore, fear and tremble, O ye people, for what 

37
00:04:42,306 --> 00:04:51,341
I the Lord have decreed in them shall be fulfilled. 

38
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:58,091
8 And verily I say unto you, that they who 

39
00:04:58,091 --> 00:05:04,841
go forth, bearing these tidings unto the inhabitants of the 

40
00:05:04,841 --> 00:05:11,591
earth, to them is power given to seal both on 

41
00:05:11,591 --> 00:05:18,869
earth and in heaven, the unbelieving and rebellious; 

42
00:05:18,869 --> 00:05:23,869
9 Yea, verily, to seal them up unto the day 

43
00:05:23,869 --> 00:05:28,869
when the wrath of God shall be poured out upon 

44
00:05:28,869 --> 00:05:33,4
the wicked without measure— 

45
00:05:33,4 --> 00:05:41,9
10 Unto the day when the Lord shall come to 

46
00:05:41,9 --> 00:05:50,4
recompense unto every man according to his work, and measure 

47
00:05:50,4 --> 00:05:58,9
to every man according to the measure which he has 

48
00:05:58,9 --> 00:06:07,667
measured to his fellow man. 

49
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:12,667
11 Wherefore the voice of the Lord is unto the 

50
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:17,667
ends of the earth, that all that will hear may 

51
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:22,933
hear: 

52
00:06:22,933 --> 00:06:28,433
12 Prepare ye, prepare ye for that which is to 

53
00:06:28,433 --> 00:06:33,944
come, for the Lord is nigh; 

54
00:06:33,944 --> 00:06:39,277
13 And the anger of the Lord is kindled, and 

55
00:06:39,277 --> 00:06:44,61
his sword is bathed in heaven, and it shall fall 

56
00:06:44,61 --> 00:06:49,442
upon the inhabitants of the earth. 

57
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:56,842
14 And the arm of the Lord shall be revealed; 

58
00:06:56,842 --> 00:07:04,242
and the day cometh that they who will not hear 

59
00:07:04,242 --> 00:07:11,642
the voice of the Lord, neither the voice of his 

60
00:07:11,642 --> 00:07:19,042
servants, neither give heed to the words of the prophets 

61
00:07:19,042 --> 00:07:26,713
and apostles, shall be cut off from among the people; 

62
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:32,213
15 For they have strayed from mine ordinances, and have 

63
00:07:32,213 --> 00:07:37,257
broken mine everlasting covenant; 

64
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:44,924
16 They seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, 

65
00:07:44,924 --> 00:07:52,591
but every man walketh in his own way, and after 

66
00:07:52,591 --> 00:08:00,258
the image of his own god, whose image is in 

67
00:08:00,258 --> 00:08:07,925
the likeness of the world, and whose substance is that 

68
00:08:07,925 --> 00:08:15,592
of an idol, which waxeth old and shall perish in 

69
00:08:15,592 --> 00:08:23,503
Babylon, even Babylon the great, which shall fall. 

70
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:29,253
17 Wherefore, I the Lord, knowing the calamity which should 

71
00:08:29,253 --> 00:08:35,003
come upon the inhabitants of the earth, called upon my 

72
00:08:35,003 --> 00:08:40,753
servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and spake unto him from heaven, 

73
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:46,259
and gave him commandments; 

74
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:54,926
18 And also gave commandments to others, that they should 

75
00:08:54,926 --> 00:09:03,593
proclaim these things unto the world; and all this that 

76
00:09:03,593 --> 00:09:12,552
it might be fulfilled, which was written by the prophets— 

77
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:20,802
19 The weak things of the world shall come forth 

78
00:09:20,802 --> 00:09:29,052
and break down the mighty and strong ones, that man 

79
00:09:29,052 --> 00:09:37,302
should not counsel his fellow man, neither trust in the 

80
00:09:37,302 --> 00:09:45,151
arm of flesh— 

81
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:52,651
20 But that every man might speak in the name 

82
00:09:52,651 --> 00:10:00,667
of God the Lord, even the Savior of the world; 

83
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:07,44
21 That faith also might increase in the earth; 

84
00:10:07,44 --> 00:10:13,496
22 That mine everlasting covenant might be established; 

85
00:10:13,496 --> 00:10:20,496
23 That the fulness of my gospel might be proclaimed 

86
00:10:20,496 --> 00:10:27,496
by the weak and the simple unto the ends of 

87
00:10:27,496 --> 00:10:34,517
the world, and before kings and rulers. 

88
00:10:34,517 --> 00:10:40,267
24 Behold, I am God and have spoken it; these 

89
00:10:40,267 --> 00:10:46,017
commandments are of me, and were given unto my servants 

90
00:10:46,017 --> 00:10:51,767
in their weakness, after the manner of their language, that 

91
00:10:51,767 --> 00:10:57,507
they might come to understanding. 

92
00:10:57,507 --> 00:11:00,007
25 And inasmuch as they erred it might be made 

93
00:11:00,007 --> 00:11:02,428
known; 

94
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:05,928
26 And inasmuch as they sought wisdom they might be 

95
00:11:05,928 --> 00:11:09,269
instructed; 

96
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:12,769
27 And inasmuch as they sinned they might be chastened, 

97
00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:16,276
that they might repent; 

98
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:20,943
28 And inasmuch as they were humble they might be 

99
00:11:20,943 --> 00:11:25,61
made strong, and blessed from on high, and receive knowledge 

100
00:11:25,61 --> 00:11:30,073
from time to time. 

101
00:11:30,073 --> 00:11:35,073
29 And after having received the record of the Nephites, 

102
00:11:35,073 --> 00:11:40,073
yea, even my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., might have power 

103
00:11:40,073 --> 00:11:45,073
to translate through the mercy of God, by the power 

104
00:11:45,073 --> 00:11:50,076
of God, the Book of Mormon. 

105
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:56,362
30 And also those to whom these commandments were given, 

106
00:11:56,362 --> 00:12:02,648
might have power to lay the foundation of this church, 

107
00:12:02,648 --> 00:12:08,934
and to bring it forth out of obscurity and out 

108
00:12:08,934 --> 00:12:15,22
of darkness, the only true and living church upon the 

109
00:12:15,22 --> 00:12:21,506
face of the whole earth, with which I, the Lord, 

110
00:12:21,506 --> 00:12:27,792
am well pleased, speaking unto the church collectively and not 

111
00:12:27,792 --> 00:12:34,837
individually— 

112
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:38,837
31 For I the Lord cannot look upon sin with 

113
00:12:38,837 --> 00:12:42,345
the least degree of allowance; 

114
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:47,345
32 Nevertheless, he that repents and does the commandments of 

115
00:12:47,345 --> 00:12:52,872
the Lord shall be forgiven; 

116
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:58,372
33 And he that repents not, from him shall be 

117
00:12:58,372 --> 00:13:03,872
taken even the light which he has received; for my 

118
00:13:03,872 --> 00:13:09,372
Spirit shall not always strive with man, saith the Lord 

119
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:14,377
of Hosts. 

120
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:19,71
34 And again, verily I say unto you, O inhabitants 

121
00:13:19,71 --> 00:13:25,043
of the earth: I the Lord am willing to make 

122
00:13:25,043 --> 00:13:30,71
these things known unto all flesh; 

123
00:13:30,71 --> 00:13:36,11
35 For I am no respecter of persons, and will 

124
00:13:36,11 --> 00:13:41,51
that all men shall know that the day speedily cometh; 

125
00:13:41,51 --> 00:13:46,91
the hour is not yet, but is nigh at hand, 

126
00:13:46,91 --> 00:13:52,31
when peace shall be taken from the earth, and the 

127
00:13:52,31 --> 00:13:57,704
devil shall have power over his own dominion. 

128
00:13:57,704 --> 00:14:04,704
36 And also the Lord shall have power over his 

129
00:14:04,704 --> 00:14:11,704
saints, and shall reign in their midst, and shall come 

130
00:14:11,704 --> 00:14:18,007
down in judgment upon Idumea, or the world. 

131
00:14:18,007 --> 00:14:25,007
37 Search these commandments, for they are true and faithful, 

132
00:14:25,007 --> 00:14:32,007
and the prophecies and promises which are in them shall 

133
00:14:32,007 --> 00:14:39,512
all be fulfilled. 

134
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:45,179
38 What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, 

135
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:50,846
and I excuse not myself; and though the heavens and 

136
00:14:50,846 --> 00:14:56,513
the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away, 

137
00:14:56,513 --> 00:15:02,18
but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice 

138
00:15:02,18 --> 00:15:07,847
or by the voice of my servants, it is the 

139
00:15:07,847 --> 00:15:13,012
same. 

140
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:15,679
39 For behold, and lo, the Lord is God, and 

141
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:18,346
the Spirit beareth record, and the record is true, and 

142
00:15:18,346 --> 00:15:21,003
the truth abideth forever and ever. Amen.
