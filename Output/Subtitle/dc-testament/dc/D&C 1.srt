4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of the Church, held at Hiram, Ohio. Many

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
revelations had been received from the Lord prior to this

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
time, and the compilation of these for

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
publication in book form was one of the principal subjects

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
passed upon at the conference. This section

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
constitutes the Lord’s preface to the doctrines,

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
covenants, and commandments given in this

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
dispensation.

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
8–16, Apostasy and wickedness precede the Second

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Coming; 
17–23, Joseph Smith is called to restore

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
to earth the Lord’s truths and powers; 
24–33,

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
The Book of Mormon is brought forth and the true

16
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Church is established; 
34–36, Peace will be taken

17
00:00:00,0 --> 01:58:49,
from the earth; 
37–39, Search these commandments. 

18
01:58:49,0 --> 01:58:49,0
1 Hearken, O ye people of my church, saith

19
01:58:49,0 --> 01:58:49,0
the voice of him who dwells on high, and

20
01:58:49,0 --> 01:58:49,0
whose eyes are upon all men; yea, verily I say:

21
01:58:49,0 --> 01:58:49,0
Hearken ye people from afar; and ye that are

22
01:58:49,0 --> 02:29:49,
upon the islands of the sea, listen together.

23
02:29:49,0 --> 02:29:49,0
2 For verily the voice of the Lord is

24
02:29:49,0 --> 02:29:49,0
unto all men, and there is none to

25
02:29:49,0 --> 02:29:49,0
escape; and there is no eye that shall not

26
02:29:49,0 --> 02:29:49,0
see, neither ear that shall not hear,

27
02:29:49,0 --> 02:59:51,
neither heart that shall not be penetrated.

28
02:59:51,0 --> 02:59:51,0
3 And the rebellious shall be pierced

29
02:59:51,0 --> 02:59:51,0
with much sorrow; for their iniquities

30
02:59:51,0 --> 02:59:51,0
shall be spoken upon the housetops,

31
02:59:51,0 --> 03:22:52,
and their secret acts shall be revealed.

32
03:22:52,0 --> 03:22:52,0
4 And the voice of warning

33
03:22:52,0 --> 03:22:52,0
shall be unto all people, by the

34
03:22:52,0 --> 03:22:52,0
mouths of my disciples, whom I

35
03:22:52,0 --> 03:40:54,
have chosen in these last days.

36
03:40:54,0 --> 03:40:54,0
5 And they shall go forth and

37
03:40:54,0 --> 03:40:54,0
none shall stay them, for I

38
03:40:54,0 --> 03:55:56,
the Lord have commanded them.

39
03:55:56,0 --> 03:55:56,0
6 Behold, this is mine

40
03:55:56,0 --> 03:55:56,0
authority, and the authority of

41
03:55:56,0 --> 03:55:56,0
my servants, and my

42
03:55:56,0 --> 03:55:56,0
preface unto the book of my

43
03:55:56,0 --> 03:55:56,0
commandments, which I have given

44
03:55:56,0 --> 03:55:56,0
them to publish unto you,

45
03:55:56,0 --> 03:57:00,
O inhabitants of the earth.

46
03:57:00,0 --> 03:57:00,0
7 Wherefore, fear and

47
03:57:00,0 --> 03:57:00,0
tremble, O ye people, for what

48
03:57:00,0 --> 03:57:00,0
I the Lord have decreed

49
03:57:00,0 --> 04:32:35,
in them shall be fulfilled.

50
04:32:35,0 --> 04:32:35,0
8 And verily I say unto

51
04:32:35,0 --> 04:32:35,0
you, that they who go

52
04:32:35,0 --> 04:32:35,0
forth, bearing these tidings

53
04:32:35,0 --> 04:32:35,0
unto the inhabitants of

54
04:32:35,0 --> 04:32:35,0
the earth, to them is

55
04:32:35,0 --> 04:32:35,0
power given to seal both on

56
04:32:35,0 --> 04:32:35,0
earth and in heaven, the

57
04:32:35,0 --> 04:49:37,
unbelieving and rebellious;

58
04:49:37,0 --> 04:49:37,0
9 Yea, verily, to seal

59
04:49:37,0 --> 04:49:37,0
them up unto the day

60
04:49:37,0 --> 04:49:37,0
when the wrath of God

61
04:49:37,0 --> 04:49:37,0
shall be poured out upon

62
04:49:37,0 --> 05:17:41,
the wicked without measure—

63
05:17:41,0 --> 05:17:41,0
10 Unto the day when

64
05:17:41,0 --> 05:17:41,0
the Lord shall come to

65
05:17:41,0 --> 05:17:41,0
recompense unto every

66
05:17:41,0 --> 05:17:41,0
man according to his

67
05:17:41,0 --> 05:17:41,0
work, and measure to

68
05:17:41,0 --> 05:17:41,0
every man according to

69
05:17:41,0 --> 05:17:41,0
the measure which he

70
05:17:41,0 --> 05:32:15,
has measured to his fellow man.

71
05:32:15,0 --> 05:32:15,0
11 Wherefore the

72
05:32:15,0 --> 05:32:15,0
voice of the Lord is

73
05:32:15,0 --> 05:32:15,0
unto the ends of

74
05:32:15,0 --> 05:32:15,0
the earth, that all

75
05:32:15,0 --> 06:06:15,
that will hear may hear:

76
06:06:15,0 --> 06:06:15,0
12 Prepare ye,

77
06:06:15,0 --> 06:06:15,0
prepare ye for that

78
06:06:15,0 --> 06:06:15,0
which is to come,

79
06:06:15,0 --> 06:21:17,
for the Lord is nigh;

80
06:21:17,0 --> 06:21:17,0
13 And the anger

81
06:21:17,0 --> 06:21:17,0
of the Lord is

82
06:21:17,0 --> 06:21:17,0
kindled, and his

83
06:21:17,0 --> 06:21:17,0
sword is bathed

84
06:21:17,0 --> 06:21:17,0
in heaven, and

85
06:21:17,0 --> 06:21:17,0
it shall fall

86
06:21:17,0 --> 06:21:17,0
upon the

87
06:21:17,0 --> 06:32:55,
inhabitants of the earth.

88
06:32:55,0 --> 06:32:55,0
14 And the arm

89
06:32:55,0 --> 06:32:55,0
of the Lord

90
06:32:55,0 --> 06:32:55,0
shall be revealed;

91
06:32:55,0 --> 06:32:55,0
and the day

92
06:32:55,0 --> 06:32:55,0
cometh that they

93
06:32:55,0 --> 06:32:55,0
who will not

94
06:32:55,0 --> 06:32:55,0
hear the voice of

95
06:32:55,0 --> 06:32:55,0
the Lord,

96
06:32:55,0 --> 06:32:55,0
neither the voice

97
06:32:55,0 --> 06:32:55,0
of his servants,

98
06:32:55,0 --> 06:32:55,0
neither give

99
06:32:55,0 --> 06:32:55,0
heed to the

100
06:32:55,0 --> 06:32:55,0
words of the

101
06:32:55,0 --> 06:32:55,0
prophets and

102
06:32:55,0 --> 06:32:55,0
apostles, shall be cut

103
06:32:55,0 --> 06:45:59,
off from among the people;

104
06:45:59,0 --> 06:45:59,0
15 For they

105
06:45:59,0 --> 06:45:59,0
have strayed

106
06:45:59,0 --> 06:45:59,0
from mine

107
06:45:59,0 --> 06:45:59,0
ordinances, and have

108
06:45:59,0 --> 06:45:59,0
broken mine

109
06:45:59,0 --> 06:48:33,
everlasting covenant;

110
06:48:33,0 --> 06:48:33,0
16 They seek

111
06:48:33,0 --> 06:48:33,0
not the Lord

112
06:48:33,0 --> 06:48:33,0
to establish

113
06:48:33,0 --> 06:48:33,0
his

114
06:48:33,0 --> 06:48:33,0
righteousness, but

115
06:48:33,0 --> 06:48:33,0
every man

116
06:48:33,0 --> 06:48:33,0
walketh in his own

117
06:48:33,0 --> 06:48:33,0
way, and

118
06:48:33,0 --> 06:48:33,0
after the image

119
06:48:33,0 --> 06:48:33,0
of his own

120
06:48:33,0 --> 06:48:33,0
god, whose image

121
06:48:33,0 --> 06:48:33,0
is in the

122
06:48:33,0 --> 06:48:33,0
likeness of the

123
06:48:33,0 --> 06:48:33,0
world, and

124
06:48:33,0 --> 06:48:33,0
whose

125
06:48:33,0 --> 06:48:33,0
substance is that of

126
06:48:33,0 --> 06:48:33,0
an idol,

127
06:48:33,0 --> 06:48:33,0
which waxeth old

128
06:48:33,0 --> 06:48:33,0
and shall

129
06:48:33,0 --> 06:48:33,0
perish in

130
06:48:33,0 --> 06:48:33,0
Babylon, even

131
06:48:33,0 --> 07:25:34,
Babylon the great, which shall fall.

132
07:25:34,0 --> 07:25:34,0
17

133
07:25:34,0 --> 07:25:34,0
Wherefore, I the

134
07:25:34,0 --> 07:25:34,0
Lord, knowing

135
07:25:34,0 --> 07:25:34,0
the calamity

136
07:25:34,0 --> 07:25:34,0
which should

137
07:25:34,0 --> 07:25:34,0
come upon

138
07:25:34,0 --> 07:25:34,0
the

139
07:25:34,0 --> 07:25:34,0
inhabitants of the

140
07:25:34,0 --> 07:25:34,0
earth, called

141
07:25:34,0 --> 07:25:34,0
upon my

142
07:25:34,0 --> 07:25:34,0
servant Joseph

143
07:25:34,0 --> 07:25:34,0
Smith, Jun.,

144
07:25:34,0 --> 07:25:34,0
and spake

145
07:25:34,0 --> 07:25:34,0
unto him from

146
07:25:34,0 --> 07:25:34,0
heaven, and

147
07:25:34,0 --> 07:36:07,
gave him commandments;

148
07:36:07,0 --> 07:36:07,0
18 And also

149
07:36:07,0 --> 07:36:07,0
gave

150
07:36:07,0 --> 07:36:07,0
commandments to

151
07:36:07,0 --> 07:36:07,0
others,

152
07:36:07,0 --> 07:36:07,0
that they

153
07:36:07,0 --> 07:36:07,0
should proclaim

154
07:36:07,0 --> 07:36:07,0
these

155
07:36:07,0 --> 07:36:07,0
things unto the

156
07:36:07,0 --> 07:36:07,0
world; and

157
07:36:07,0 --> 07:36:07,0
all this

158
07:36:07,0 --> 07:36:07,0
that it

159
07:36:07,0 --> 07:36:07,0
might be

160
07:36:07,0 --> 07:36:07,0
fulfilled, which

161
07:36:07,0 --> 07:36:07,0
was written

162
07:36:07,0 --> 08:22:07,
by the prophets—

163
08:22:07,0 --> 08:22:07,0
19 The

164
08:22:07,0 --> 08:22:07,0
weak things

165
08:22:07,0 --> 08:22:07,0
of the

166
08:22:07,0 --> 08:22:07,0
world shall

167
08:22:07,0 --> 08:22:07,0
come forth

168
08:22:07,0 --> 08:22:07,0
and break

169
08:22:07,0 --> 08:22:07,0
down the

170
08:22:07,0 --> 08:22:07,0
mighty and

171
08:22:07,0 --> 08:22:07,0
strong

172
08:22:07,0 --> 08:22:07,0
ones, that man

173
08:22:07,0 --> 08:22:07,0
should

174
08:22:07,0 --> 08:22:07,0
not counsel

175
08:22:07,0 --> 08:22:07,0
his fellow

176
08:22:07,0 --> 08:22:07,0
man,

177
08:22:07,0 --> 08:22:07,0
neither trust

178
08:22:07,0 --> 08:45:08,
in the arm of flesh—

179
08:45:08,0 --> 08:45:08,0
20 But

180
08:45:08,0 --> 08:45:08,0
that every

181
08:45:08,0 --> 08:45:08,0
man might

182
08:45:08,0 --> 08:45:08,0
speak in

183
08:45:08,0 --> 08:45:08,0
the name

184
08:45:08,0 --> 08:45:08,0
of God

185
08:45:08,0 --> 08:45:08,0
the Lord,

186
08:45:08,0 --> 08:45:08,0
even the

187
08:45:08,0 --> 08:45:08,0
Savior of

188
08:45:08,0 --> 09:11:09,
the world;

189
09:11:09,0 --> 09:11:09,0
21 That

190
09:11:09,0 --> 09:11:09,0
faith

191
09:11:09,0 --> 09:11:09,0
also

192
09:11:09,0 --> 09:11:09,0
might

193
09:11:09,0 --> 09:11:09,0
increase

194
09:11:09,0 --> 09:42:09,
in the earth;

195
09:42:09,0 --> 09:42:09,0
22

196
09:42:09,0 --> 09:42:09,0
That mine

197
09:42:09,0 --> 09:42:09,0


198
09:42:09,0 --> 09:42:09,0
everlasting

199
09:42:09,0 --> 09:42:09,0


200
09:42:09,0 --> 09:42:09,0
covenant

201
09:42:09,0 --> 09:42:09,0
might be

202
09:42:09,0 --> 09:43:13,
established;

203
09:43:13,0 --> 09:43:13,0
23

204
09:43:13,0 --> 09:43:13,0
That

205
09:43:13,0 --> 09:43:13,0
the

206
09:43:13,0 --> 09:43:13,0
fulness

207
09:43:13,0 --> 09:43:13,0
of my

208
09:43:13,0 --> 09:43:13,0


209
09:43:13,0 --> 09:43:13,0
gospel

210
09:43:13,0 --> 09:43:13,0
might

211
09:43:13,0 --> 09:43:13,0
be

212
09:43:13,0 --> 09:43:13,0


213
09:43:13,0 --> 09:43:13,0
proclaimed by

214
09:43:13,0 --> 09:43:13,0
the

215
09:43:13,0 --> 09:43:13,0
weak

216
09:43:13,0 --> 09:43:13,0
and

217
09:43:13,0 --> 09:43:13,0
the

218
09:43:13,0 --> 09:43:13,0
simple

219
09:43:13,0 --> 09:43:13,0
unto

220
09:43:13,0 --> 09:43:13,0
the

221
09:43:13,0 --> 09:43:13,0
ends

222
09:43:13,0 --> 09:43:13,0
