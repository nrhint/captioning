1
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:19,463
verses 60 through 100 incorporate a revelation

2
00:00:19,463 --> 00:00:27,648
 given through Joseph Smith on November 11, 1831. This

3
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:35,833
 section was associated with the organization of

4
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:44,018
 the Quorum of the Twelve in February and March

5
00:00:44,018 --> 00:00:52,203
 1835. The Prophet likely delivered it in the presence

6
00:00:52,203 --> 00:01:00,388
 of those who were preparing to depart May 3, 1835,

7
00:01:00,388 --> 00:01:08,573
 on their first quorum mission. 
1–6, There are

8
00:01:08,573 --> 00:01:16,758
 two priesthoods: the Melchizedek and the Aaronic;

9
00:01:16,758 --> 00:01:24,943
7–12, Those who hold the Melchizedek Priesthood

10
00:01:24,943 --> 00:01:33,128
 have power to officiate in all offices in the Church;

11
00:01:33,128 --> 00:01:41,313
13–17, The bishopric presides over the Aaronic

12
00:01:41,313 --> 00:01:49,498
 Priesthood, which administers in outward

13
00:01:49,498 --> 00:01:57,683
 ordinances; 
18–20, The Melchizedek Priesthood holds the

14
00:01:57,683 --> 00:02:05,868
 keys of all spiritual blessings; the Aaronic

15
00:02:05,868 --> 00:02:14,053
 Priesthood holds the keys of the ministering of angels;

16
00:02:14,053 --> 00:02:22,238
21–38, The First Presidency, the Twelve, and the

17
00:02:22,238 --> 00:02:30,423
 Seventy constitute the presiding quorums, whose

18
00:02:30,423 --> 00:02:38,608
 decisions are to be made in unity and righteousness;

19
00:02:38,608 --> 00:02:46,793
39–52, The patriarchal order is established from

20
00:02:46,793 --> 00:02:54,978
 Adam to Noah; 
53–57, Ancient Saints assembled at

21
00:02:54,978 --> 00:03:03,163
 Adam-ondi-Ahman, and the Lord appeared to them;

22
00:03:03,163 --> 00:03:11,348
58–67, The Twelve are to set the officers of the

23
00:03:11,348 --> 00:03:19,533
 Church in order; 
68–76, Bishops serve as common

24
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:27,718
 judges in Israel; 
77–84, The First Presidency and the

25
00:03:27,718 --> 00:03:35,903
 Twelve constitute the highest court in the

26
00:03:35,903 --> 00:03:44,088
 Church; 
85–100, Priesthood presidents govern their

27
00:03:44,088 --> 00:03:52,273
 respective quorums.

28
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:59,966
1 There are, in the church, two priesthoods,

29
00:03:59,966 --> 00:04:07,633
 namely, the Melchizedek and Aaronic, including the

30
00:04:07,633 --> 00:04:15,3
 Levitical Priesthood

31
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:21,789
2 Why the first is called the Melchizedek

32
00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:27,789
 Priesthood is because Melchizedek was such a great high

33
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:33,789
 priest

34
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:39,807
3 Before his day it was called the Holy

35
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:45,807
 Priesthood, after the Order of the Son of God

36
00:04:45,635 --> 00:04:50,035
4 But out of respect or reverence to the name of

37
00:04:50,035 --> 00:04:54,435
 the Supreme Being, to avoid the too frequent

38
00:04:54,435 --> 00:04:58,835
 repetition of his name, they, the church, in ancient

39
00:04:58,835 --> 00:05:03,235
 days, called that priesthood after Melchizedek, or

40
00:05:03,235 --> 00:05:07,635
 the Melchizedek Priesthood

41
00:05:07,14 --> 00:05:11,14
5 All other authorities or offices in the church

42
00:05:11,14 --> 00:05:15,14
 are appendages to this priesthood

43
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:21,032
6 But there are two divisions or grand heads—one

44
00:05:21,032 --> 00:05:26,365
 is the Melchizedek Priesthood, and the other is the

45
00:05:26,365 --> 00:05:31,698
 Aaronic or Levitical Priesthood

46
00:05:31,448 --> 00:05:34,948
7 The office of an elder comes under the

47
00:05:34,948 --> 00:05:38,448
 priesthood of Melchizedek

48
00:05:38,955 --> 00:05:43,955
8 The Melchizedek Priesthood holds the right of

49
00:05:43,955 --> 00:05:48,955
 presidency, and has power and authority over all the

50
00:05:48,955 --> 00:05:53,955
 offices in the church in all ages of the world,

51
00:05:53,955 --> 00:05:58,955
 to administer in spiritual things

52
00:05:58,475 --> 00:06:02,808
9 The Presidency of the High Priesthood, after the

53
00:06:02,808 --> 00:06:07,141
 order of Melchizedek, have a right to officiate

54
00:06:07,141 --> 00:06:11,474
 in all the offices in the church

55
00:06:11,755 --> 00:06:16,922
10 High priests after the order of the Melchizedek

56
00:06:16,922 --> 00:06:22,089
 Priesthood have a right to officiate in their own

57
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:27,256
 standing, under the direction of the presidency,

58
00:06:27,256 --> 00:06:32,423
 in administering spiritual things, and also in the

59
00:06:32,423 --> 00:06:37,59
 office of an elder, priest (of the Levitical

60
00:06:37,59 --> 00:06:42,757
 order), teacher, deacon, and member

61
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:47,236
11 An elder has a right to officiate in his stead

62
00:06:47,236 --> 00:06:51,736
 when the high priest is not present

63
00:06:51,061 --> 00:06:55,661
12 The high priest and elder are to administer in

64
00:06:55,661 --> 00:07:00,261
 spiritual things, agreeable to the covenants and

65
00:07:00,261 --> 00:07:04,861
 commandments of the church; and they have a right

66
00:07:04,861 --> 00:07:09,461
 to officiate in all these offices of the church

67
00:07:09,461 --> 00:07:14,061
 when there are no higher authorities present

68
00:07:14,05 --> 00:07:20,383
13 The second priesthood is called the Priesthood

69
00:07:20,383 --> 00:07:26,716
 of Aaron, because it was conferred upon Aaron and

70
00:07:26,716 --> 00:07:33,049
 his seed, throughout all their generations

71
00:07:33,57 --> 00:07:38,82
14 Why it is called the lesser priesthood is

72
00:07:38,82 --> 00:07:44,07
 because it is an appendage to the greater, or the

73
00:07:44,07 --> 00:07:49,32
 Melchizedek Priesthood, and has power in administering

74
00:07:49,32 --> 00:07:54,57
 outward ordinances

75
00:07:54,374 --> 00:08:01,374
15 The bishopric is the presidency of this

76
00:08:01,374 --> 00:08:08,374
 priesthood, and holds the keys or authority of the same

77
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:16,655
16 No man has a legal right to this office, to

78
00:08:16,655 --> 00:08:24,655
 hold the keys of this priesthood, except he be a

79
00:08:24,655 --> 00:08:32,655
 literal descendant of Aaron

80
00:08:32,696 --> 00:08:38,125
17 But as a high priest of the Melchizedek

81
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:43,554
 Priesthood has authority to officiate in all the lesser

82
00:08:43,554 --> 00:08:48,983
 offices, he may officiate in the office of bishop

83
00:08:48,983 --> 00:08:54,412
 when no literal descendant of Aaron can be found,

84
00:08:54,412 --> 00:08:59,841
 provided he is called and set apart and ordained

85
00:08:59,841 --> 00:09:05,27
 unto this power by the hands of the Presidency of

86
00:09:05,27 --> 00:09:10,699
 the Melchizedek Priesthood

87
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:14,667
18 The power and authority of the higher, or

88
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:18,667
 Melchizedek Priesthood, is to hold the keys of all the

89
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:22,667
 spiritual blessings of the church

90
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:28,179
19 To have the privilege of receiving the

91
00:09:28,179 --> 00:09:33,679
 mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, to have the heavens

92
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:39,179
 opened unto them, to commune with the general

93
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:44,679
 assembly and church of the Firstborn, and to enjoy the

94
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:50,179
 communion and presence of God the Father, and Jesus

95
00:09:50,179 --> 00:09:55,679
 the mediator of the new covenant

96
00:09:55,295 --> 00:10:00,795
20 The power and authority of the lesser, or

97
00:10:00,795 --> 00:10:06,295
 Aaronic Priesthood, is to hold the keys of the

98
00:10:06,295 --> 00:10:11,795
 ministering of angels, and to administer in outward

99
00:10:11,795 --> 00:10:17,295
 ordinances, the letter of the gospel, the baptism of

100
00:10:17,295 --> 00:10:22,795
 repentance for the remission of sins, agreeable to

101
00:10:22,795 --> 00:10:28,295
 the covenants and commandments

102
00:10:28,812 --> 00:10:34,312
21 Of necessity there are presidents, or presiding

103
00:10:34,312 --> 00:10:39,812
 officers growing out of, or appointed of or from

104
00:10:39,812 --> 00:10:45,312
 among those who are ordained to the several

105
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:50,812
 offices in these two priesthoods

106
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:57,316
22 Of the Melchizedek Priesthood, three Presiding

107
00:10:57,316 --> 00:11:04,316
 High Priests, chosen by the body, appointed and

108
00:11:04,316 --> 00:11:11,316
 ordained to that office, and upheld by the

109
00:11:11,316 --> 00:11:18,316
 confidence, faith, and prayer of the church, form a quorum

110
00:11:18,316 --> 00:11:25,316
 of the Presidency of the Church

111
00:11:25,068 --> 00:11:30,868
23 The twelve traveling councilors are called to

112
00:11:30,868 --> 00:11:36,668
 be the Twelve Apostles, or special witnesses of the

113
00:11:36,668 --> 00:11:42,468
 name of Christ in all the world—thus differing

114
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:48,268
 from other officers in the church in the duties of

115
00:11:48,268 --> 00:11:54,068
 their calling

116
00:11:54,564 --> 00:11:58,897
24 And they form a quorum, equal in authority and

117
00:11:58,897 --> 00:12:03,23
 power to the three presidents previously

118
00:12:03,23 --> 00:12:07,563
 mentioned

119
00:12:07,577 --> 00:12:13,377
25 The Seventy are also called to preach the

120
00:12:13,377 --> 00:12:19,177
 gospel, and to be especial witnesses unto the Gentiles

121
00:12:19,177 --> 00:12:24,977
 and in all the world—thus differing from other

122
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:30,777
 officers in the church in the duties of their

123
00:12:30,777 --> 00:12:36,577
 calling

124
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:40,756
26 And they form a quorum, equal in authority to

125
00:12:40,756 --> 00:12:45,423
 that of the Twelve special witnesses or Apostles

126
00:12:45,423 --> 00:12:50,09
 just named

127
00:12:50,37 --> 00:12:54,87
27 And every decision made by either of these

128
00:12:54,87 --> 00:12:59,37
 quorums must be by the unanimous voice of the same;

129
00:12:59,37 --> 00:13:03,87
 that is, every member in each quorum must be agreed

130
00:13:03,87 --> 00:13:08,37
 to its decisions, in order to make their decisions

131
00:13:08,37 --> 00:13:12,87
 of the same power or validity one with the other

132
00:13:12,87 --> 00:13:17,37


133
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:34,864
28 A majority may form a quorum when circumstances

134
00:13:34,864 --> 00:13:51,864
 render it impossible to be otherwise

135
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:54,198
29 Unless this is the case, their decisions are

136
00:13:54,198 --> 00:13:56,598
 not entitled to the same blessings which the

137
00:13:56,598 --> 00:13:58,998
 decisions of a quorum of three presidents were anciently,

138
00:13:58,998 --> 00:14:01,398
 who were ordained after the order of Melchizedek,

139
00:14:01,398 --> 00:14:03,798
 and were righteous and holy men

140
00:14:03,326 --> 00:14:07,826
30 The decisions of these quorums, or either of

141
00:14:07,826 --> 00:14:12,326
 them, are to be made in all righteousness, in

142
00:14:12,326 --> 00:14:16,826
 holiness, and lowliness of heart, meekness and

143
00:14:16,826 --> 00:14:21,326
 long-suffering, and in faith, and virtue, and knowledge,

144
00:14:21,326 --> 00:14:25,826
 temperance, patience, godliness, brotherly kindness

145
00:14:25,826 --> 00:14:30,326
 and charity

146
00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:35,319
31 Because the promise is, if these things abound

147
00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:40,319
 in them they shall not be unfruitful in the

148
00:14:40,319 --> 00:14:45,319
 knowledge of the Lord

149
00:14:45,835 --> 00:14:51,335
32 And in case that any decision of these quorums

150
00:14:51,335 --> 00:14:56,835
 is made in unrighteousness, it may be brought

151
00:14:56,835 --> 00:15:02,335
 before a general assembly of the several quorums,

152
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:07,835
 which constitute the spiritual authorities of the

153
00:15:07,835 --> 00:15:13,335
 church; otherwise there can be no appeal from their

154
00:15:13,335 --> 00:15:18,835
 decision

155
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:23,831
33 The Twelve are a Traveling Presiding High

156
00:15:23,831 --> 00:15:29,545
 Council, to officiate in the name of the Lord, under

157
00:15:29,545 --> 00:15:35,259
 the direction of the Presidency of the Church,

158
00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:40,973
 agreeable to the institution of heaven; to build up the

159
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:46,687
 church, and regulate all the affairs of the same

160
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:52,401
 in all nations, first unto the Gentiles and

161
00:15:52,401 --> 00:15:58,115
 secondly unto the Jews

162
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:05,075
34 The Seventy are to act in the name of the Lord,

163
00:16:05,075 --> 00:16:11,275
 under the direction of the Twelve or the

164
00:16:11,275 --> 00:16:17,475
 traveling high council, in building up the church and

165
00:16:17,475 --> 00:16:23,675
 regulating all the affairs of the same in all nations,

166
00:16:23,675 --> 00:16:29,875
 first unto the Gentiles and then to the Jews

167
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:34,872
35 The Twelve being sent out, holding the keys, to

168
00:16:34,872 --> 00:16:40,122
 open the door by the proclamation of the gospel

169
00:16:40,122 --> 00:16:45,372
 of Jesus Christ, and first unto the Gentiles and

170
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:50,622
 then unto the Jews

171
00:16:50,393 --> 00:16:55,793
36 The standing high councils, at the stakes of

172
00:16:55,793 --> 00:17:01,193
 Zion, form a quorum equal in authority in the

173
00:17:01,193 --> 00:17:06,593
 affairs of the church, in all their decisions, to the

174
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:11,993
 quorum of the presidency, or to the traveling high

175
00:17:11,993 --> 00:17:17,393
 council

176
00:17:17,386 --> 00:17:23,886
37 The high council in Zion form a quorum equal in

177
00:17:23,886 --> 00:17:30,386
 authority in the affairs of the church, in all

178
00:17:30,386 --> 00:17:36,886
 their decisions, to the councils of the Twelve at

179
00:17:36,886 --> 00:17:43,386
 the stakes of Zion

180
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:50,646
38 It is the duty of the traveling high council to

181
00:17:50,646 --> 00:17:57,396
 call upon the Seventy, when they need assistance,

182
00:17:57,396 --> 00:18:04,146
 to fill the several calls for preaching and

183
00:18:04,146 --> 00:18:10,896
 administering the gospel, instead of any others

184
00:18:10,89 --> 00:18:15,14
39 It is the duty of the Twelve, in all large

185
00:18:15,14 --> 00:18:19,39
 branches of the church, to ordain evangelical

186
00:18:19,39 --> 00:18:23,64
 ministers, as they shall be designated unto them by

187
00:18:23,64 --> 00:18:27,89
 revelation

188
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:31,673
40 The order of this priesthood was confirmed to

189
00:18:31,673 --> 00:18:35,673
 be handed down from father to son, and rightly

190
00:18:35,673 --> 00:18:39,673
 belongs to the literal descendants of the chosen seed,

191
00:18:39,673 --> 00:18:43,673
 to whom the promises were made

192
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:51,156
41 This order was instituted in the days of Adam,

193
00:18:51,156 --> 00:18:58,656
 and came down by lineage in the following manner

194
00:18:58,921 --> 00:19:04,492
42 From Adam to Seth, who was ordained by Adam at

195
00:19:04,492 --> 00:19:10,063
 the age of sixty-nine years, and was blessed by

196
00:19:10,063 --> 00:19:15,634
 him three years previous to his (Adam’s) death, and

197
00:19:15,634 --> 00:19:21,205
 received the promise of God by his father, that

198
00:19:21,205 --> 00:19:26,776
 his posterity should be the chosen of the Lord, and

199
00:19:26,776 --> 00:19:32,347
 that they should be preserved unto the end of the

200
00:19:32,347 --> 00:19:37,918
 earth

201
00:19:37,41 --> 00:19:41,61
43 Because he (Seth) was a perfect man, and his

202
00:19:41,61 --> 00:19:45,81
 likeness was the express likeness of his father,

203
00:19:45,81 --> 00:19:50,01
 insomuch that he seemed to be like unto his father in

204
00:19:50,01 --> 00:19:54,21
 all things, and could be distinguished from him

205
00:19:54,21 --> 00:19:58,41
 only by his age

206
00:19:58,414 --> 00:20:01,414
44 Enos was ordained at the age of one hundred and

207
00:20:01,414 --> 00:20:04,414
 thirty-four years and four months, by the hand of

208
00:20:04,414 --> 00:20:07,414
 Adam

209
00:20:07,223 --> 00:20:13,723
45 God called upon Cainan in the wilderness in the

210
00:20:13,723 --> 00:20:20,223
 fortieth year of his age; and he met Adam in

211
00:20:20,223 --> 00:20:26,723
 journeying to the place Shedolamak. He was

212
00:20:26,723 --> 00:20:33,223
 eighty-seven years old when he received his ordination

213
00:20:33,215 --> 00:20:36,548
46 Mahalaleel was four hundred and ninety-six

214
00:20:36,548 --> 00:20:39,881
 years and seven days old when he was ordained by the

215
00:20:39,881 --> 00:20:43,214
 hand of Adam, who also blessed him

216
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:46,092
47 Jared was two hundred years old when he was

217
00:20:46,092 --> 00:20:48,425
 ordained under the hand of Adam, who also blessed

218
00:20:48,425 --> 00:20:50,758
 him

219
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:54,282
48 Enoch was twenty-five years old when he was

220
00:20:54,282 --> 00:20:58,282
 ordained under the hand of Adam; and he was

221
00:20:58,282 --> 00:21:02,282
 sixty-five and Adam blessed him

222
00:21:02,812 --> 00:21:07,612
49 And he saw the Lord, and he walked with him,

223
00:21:07,612 --> 00:21:12,412
 and was before his face continually; and he walked

224
00:21:12,412 --> 00:21:17,212
 with God three hundred and sixty-five years, making

225
00:21:17,212 --> 00:21:22,012
 him four hundred and thirty years old when he was

226
00:21:22,012 --> 00:21:26,812
 translated

227
00:21:26,302 --> 00:21:30,302
50 Methuselah was one hundred years old when he

228
00:21:30,302 --> 00:21:34,302
 was ordained under the hand of Adam

229
00:21:34,844 --> 00:21:38,844
51 Lamech was thirty-two years old when he was

230
00:21:38,844 --> 00:21:42,844
 ordained under the hand of Seth

231
00:21:42,117 --> 00:21:46,617
52 Noah was ten years old when he was ordained

232
00:21:46,617 --> 00:21:51,117
 under the hand of Methuselah

233
00:21:51,894 --> 00:22:00,227
53 Three years previous to the death of Adam, he

234
00:22:00,227 --> 00:22:08,56
 called Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared,

235
00:22:08,56 --> 00:22:16,893
 Enoch, and Methuselah, who were all high priests, with

236
00:22:16,893 --> 00:22:25,226
 the residue of his posterity who were righteous,

237
00:22:25,226 --> 00:22:33,559
 into the valley of Adam-ondi-Ahman, and there

238
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:41,892
 bestowed upon them his last blessing

239
00:22:41,627 --> 00:22:48,294
54 And the Lord appeared unto them, and they rose

240
00:22:48,294 --> 00:22:54,961
 up and blessed Adam, and called him Michael, the

241
00:22:54,961 --> 00:23:01,628
 prince, the archangel

242
00:23:01,38 --> 00:23:08,13
55 And the Lord administered comfort unto Adam,

243
00:23:08,13 --> 00:23:14,88
 and said unto him: I have set thee to be at the

244
00:23:14,88 --> 00:23:21,63
 head; a multitude of nations shall come of thee, and

245
00:23:21,63 --> 00:23:28,38
 thou art a prince over them forever

246
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:33,674
56 And Adam stood up in the midst of the

247
00:23:33,674 --> 00:23:38,474
 congregation; and, notwithstanding he was bowed down with

248
00:23:38,474 --> 00:23:43,274
 age, being full of the Holy Ghost, predicted

249
00:23:43,274 --> 00:23:48,074
 whatsoever should befall his posterity unto the latest

250
00:23:48,074 --> 00:23:52,874
 generation

251
00:23:52,615 --> 00:23:59,115
57 These things were all written in the book of

252
00:23:59,115 --> 00:24:05,615
 Enoch, and are to be testified of in due time

253
00:24:05,394 --> 00:24:11,394
58 It is the duty of the Twelve, also, to ordain

254
00:24:11,394 --> 00:24:17,394
 and set in order all the other officers of the

255
00:24:17,394 --> 00:24:23,394
 church, agreeable to the revelation which says

256
00:24:23,162 --> 00:24:27,162
59 To the church of Christ in the land of Zion, in

257
00:24:27,162 --> 00:24:31,162
 addition to the church laws respecting church

258
00:24:31,162 --> 00:24:35,162
 business

259
00:24:35,457 --> 00:24:40,457
60 Verily, I say unto you, saith the Lord of

260
00:24:40,457 --> 00:24:45,457
 Hosts, there must needs be presiding elders to preside

261
00:24:45,457 --> 00:24:50,457
 over those who are of the office of an elder

262
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:54,222
61 And also priests to preside over those who are

263
00:24:54,222 --> 00:24:58,222
 of the office of a priest

264
00:24:58,213 --> 00:25:01,88
62 And also teachers to preside over those who are

265
00:25:01,88 --> 00:25:05,547
 of the office of a teacher, in like manner, and

266
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:09,214
 also the deacons

267
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:15,242
63 Wherefore, from deacon to teacher, and from

268
00:25:15,242 --> 00:25:20,742
 teacher to priest, and from priest to elder,

269
00:25:20,742 --> 00:25:26,242
 severally as they are appointed, according to the

270
00:25:26,242 --> 00:25:31,742
 covenants and commandments of the church

271
00:25:31,013 --> 00:25:33,513
64 Then comes the High Priesthood, which is the

272
00:25:33,513 --> 00:25:36,013
 greatest of all

273
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:39,534
65 Wherefore, it must needs be that one be

274
00:25:39,534 --> 00:25:43,034
 appointed of the High Priesthood to preside over the

275
00:25:43,034 --> 00:25:46,534
 priesthood, and he shall be called President of the

276
00:25:46,534 --> 00:25:50,034
 High Priesthood of the Church

277
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:54,382
66 Or, in other words, the Presiding High Priest

278
00:25:54,382 --> 00:25:58,382
 over the High Priesthood of the Church

279
00:25:58,69 --> 00:26:03,69
67 From the same comes the administering of

280
00:26:03,69 --> 00:26:08,69
 ordinances and blessings upon the church, by the laying

281
00:26:08,69 --> 00:26:13,69
 on of the hands

282
00:26:13,956 --> 00:26:18,623
68 Wherefore, the office of a bishop is not equal

283
00:26:18,623 --> 00:26:23,29
 unto it; for the office of a bishop is in

284
00:26:23,29 --> 00:26:27,957
 administering all temporal things

285
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:32,319
69 Nevertheless a bishop must be chosen from the

286
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:36,652
 High Priesthood, unless he is a literal descendant

287
00:26:36,652 --> 00:26:40,985
 of Aaron

288
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:47,766
70 For unless he is a literal descendant of Aaron

289
00:26:47,766 --> 00:26:54,766
 he cannot hold the keys of that priesthood

290
00:26:54,53 --> 00:26:59,03
71 Nevertheless, a high priest, that is, after the

291
00:26:59,03 --> 00:27:03,53
 order of Melchizedek, may be set apart unto the

292
00:27:03,53 --> 00:27:08,03
 ministering of temporal things, having a knowledge

293
00:27:08,03 --> 00:27:12,53
 of them by the Spirit of truth

294
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:17,964
72 And also to be a judge in Israel, to do the

295
00:27:17,964 --> 00:27:23,631
 business of the church, to sit in judgment upon

296
00:27:23,631 --> 00:27:29,298
 transgressors upon testimony as it shall be laid before

297
00:27:29,298 --> 00:27:34,965
 him according to the laws, by the assistance of

298
00:27:34,965 --> 00:27:40,632
 his counselors, whom he has chosen or will choose

299
00:27:40,632 --> 00:27:46,299
 among the elders of the church

300
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:50,048
73 This is the duty of a bishop who is not a

301
00:27:50,048 --> 00:27:54,048
 literal descendant of Aaron, but has been ordained to

302
00:27:54,048 --> 00:27:58,048
 the High Priesthood after the order of Melchizedek

303
00:27:58,048 --> 00:28:02,048


304
00:28:02,831 --> 00:28:09,831
74 Thus shall he be a judge, even a common judge

305
00:28:09,831 --> 00:28:16,831
 among the inhabitants of Zion, or in a stake of

306
00:28:16,831 --> 00:28:23,831
 Zion, or in any branch of the church where he shall

307
00:28:23,831 --> 00:28:30,831
 be set apart unto this ministry, until the borders

308
00:28:30,831 --> 00:28:37,831
 of Zion are enlarged and it becomes necessary to

309
00:28:37,831 --> 00:28:44,831
 have other bishops or judges in Zion or elsewhere

310
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:49,806
75 And inasmuch as there are other bishops

311
00:28:49,806 --> 00:28:54,806
 appointed they shall act in the same office

312
00:28:54,333 --> 00:29:01,476
76 But a literal descendant of Aaron has a legal

313
00:29:01,476 --> 00:29:08,619
 right to the presidency of this priesthood, to the

314
00:29:08,619 --> 00:29:15,762
 keys of this ministry, to act in the office of

315
00:29:15,762 --> 00:29:22,905
 bishop independently, without counselors, except in a

316
00:29:22,905 --> 00:29:30,048
 case where a President of the High Priesthood,

317
00:29:30,048 --> 00:29:37,191
 after the order of Melchizedek, is tried, to sit as

318
00:29:37,191 --> 00:29:44,334
 a judge in Israel

319
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:49,816
77 And the decision of either of these councils,

320
00:29:49,816 --> 00:29:54,816
 agreeable to the commandment which says

321
00:29:54,593 --> 00:29:58,45
78 Again, verily, I say unto you, the most

322
00:29:58,45 --> 00:30:02,307
 important business of the church, and the most difficult

323
00:30:02,307 --> 00:30:06,164
 cases of the church, inasmuch as there is not

324
00:30:06,164 --> 00:30:10,021
 satisfaction upon the decision of the bishop or

325
00:30:10,021 --> 00:30:13,878
 judges, it shall be handed over and carried up unto the

326
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:17,735
 council of the church, before the Presidency of

327
00:30:17,735 --> 00:30:21,592
 the High Priesthood

328
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:27,02
79 And the Presidency of the council of the High

329
00:30:27,02 --> 00:30:32,187
 Priesthood shall have power to call other high

330
00:30:32,187 --> 00:30:37,354
 priests, even twelve, to assist as counselors; and

331
00:30:37,354 --> 00:30:42,521
 thus the Presidency of the High Priesthood and its

332
00:30:42,521 --> 00:30:47,688
 counselors shall have power to decide upon testimony

333
00:30:47,688 --> 00:30:52,855
 according to the laws of the church

334
00:30:52,834 --> 00:30:59,084
80 And after this decision it shall be had in

335
00:30:59,084 --> 00:31:05,334
 remembrance no more before the Lord; for this is the

336
00:31:05,334 --> 00:31:11,584
 highest council of the church of God, and a final

337
00:31:11,584 --> 00:31:17,834
 decision upon controversies in spiritual matters

338
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:24,125
81 There is not any person belonging to the church

339
00:31:24,125 --> 00:31:31,125
 who is exempt from this council of the church

340
00:31:31,173 --> 00:31:34,973
82 And inasmuch as a President of the High

341
00:31:34,973 --> 00:31:38,773
 Priesthood shall transgress, he shall be had in

342
00:31:38,773 --> 00:31:42,573
 remembrance before the common council of the church, who

343
00:31:42,573 --> 00:31:46,373
 shall be assisted by twelve counselors of the High

344
00:31:46,373 --> 00:31:50,173
 Priesthood

345
00:31:50,442 --> 00:31:53,942
83 And their decision upon his head shall be an

346
00:31:53,942 --> 00:31:57,442
 end of controversy concerning him

347
00:31:57,716 --> 00:32:03,216
84 Thus, none shall be exempted from the justice

348
00:32:03,216 --> 00:32:08,716
 and the laws of God, that all things may be done in

349
00:32:08,716 --> 00:32:14,216
 order and in solemnity before him, according to

350
00:32:14,216 --> 00:32:19,716
 truth and righteousness

351
00:32:19,221 --> 00:32:24,821
85 And again, verily I say unto you, the duty of a

352
00:32:24,821 --> 00:32:30,421
 president over the office of a deacon is to

353
00:32:30,421 --> 00:32:36,021
 preside over twelve deacons, to sit in council with

354
00:32:36,021 --> 00:32:41,621

00:32:41,621 --> 00:32:47,221

365
00:33:23,202 --> 00:33:27,202
 covenants

366
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:33,739
88 This president is to be a bishop; for this is

367
00:33:33,739 --> 00:33:39,739
 one of the duties of this priesthood

368
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:43,001

 according to the covenants

372
00:33:54,266 --> 00:34:01,266
90 This presidency is a distinct one from that of

373
00:34:01,266 --> 00:34:08,266
 the seventy, and is designed for those who do not

374
00:34:08,266 --> 00:34:15,266
 travel into all the world

375
00:34:15,036 --> 00:34:18,036

 whole church, and to be like unto Moses

378
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:29,579
92 Behold, here is wisdom; yea, to be a seer, a

379
00:34:29,579 --> 00:34:34,829
 revelator, a translator, and a prophet, having all

380
00:34:34,829 --> 00:34:40,079
 the gifts of God which he bestows upon the head of

381
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:45,329
 the church

382
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:51,083
93 And it is according to the vision showing the

383
00:34:51,083 --> 00:34:56,833
 order of the Seventy, that they should have seven

384
00:34:56,833 --> 00:35:02,583
 presidents to preside over them, chosen out of the

385
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:08,333
 number of the seventy

386
00:35:08,089 --> 00:35:14,589
94 And the seventh president of these presidents

387
00:35:14,589 --> 00:35:21,089
 is to preside over the six

388
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:26,702
95 And these seven presidents are to choose other

389
00:35:26,702 --> 00:35:32,035
 seventy besides the first seventy to whom they

390
00:35:32,035 --> 00:35:37,368
 belong, and are to preside over them

391
00:35:37,352 --> 00:35:42,019
96 And also other seventy, until seven times

392
00:35:42,019 --> 00:35:46,686
 seventy, if the labor in the vineyard of necessity

393
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:51,353
 requires it

394
00:35:51,866 --> 00:35:59,366
97 And these seventy are to be traveling

395
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:06,866
 ministers, unto the Gentiles first and also unto the Jews

396
00:36:06,147 --> 00:36:12,147
98 Whereas other officers of the church, who

397
00:36:12,147 --> 00:36:18,147
 belong not unto the Twelve, neither to the Seventy, are

398
00:36:18,147 --> 00:36:24,147
 not under the responsibility to travel among all

399
00:36:24,147 --> 00:36:30,147
 nations, but are to travel as their circumstances

400
00:36:30,147 --> 00:36:36,147
 shall allow, notwithstanding they may hold as high

401
00:36:36,147 --> 00:36:42,147
 and responsible offices in the church

402
00:36:42,65 --> 00:36:46,983
99 Wherefore, now let every man learn his duty,

403
00:36:46,983 --> 00:36:51,316
 and to act in the office in which he is appointed,

404
00:36:51,316 --> 00:36:55,649
 in all diligence
