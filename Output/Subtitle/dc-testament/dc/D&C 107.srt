1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
verses 60 through 100 incorporate a revelation

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
given through Joseph Smith on November 11, 1831.

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
This section was associated with the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
organization of the Quorum of the Twelve in February and

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
March 1835. The Prophet likely delivered it in the

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
presence of those who were preparing to depart

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
May 3, 1835, on their first quorum mission.

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
1–6, There are two priesthoods: the Melchizedek and

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Aaronic; 
7–12, Those who hold the

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Melchizedek Priesthood have power to officiate in all

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
offices in the Church; 
13–17, The bishopric

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
presides over the Aaronic Priesthood, which

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
administers in outward ordinances; 
18–20, The

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Melchizedek Priesthood holds the keys of all spiritual

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
blessings; the Aaronic Priesthood holds the keys of

16
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the ministering of angels; 
21–38, The First

17
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Presidency, the Twelve, and the Seventy constitute

18
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the presiding quorums, whose decisions are to

19
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
be made in unity and righteousness; 
39–52, The

20
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
patriarchal order is established from Adam to

21
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Noah; 
53–57, Ancient Saints assembled at

22
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Adam-ondi-Ahman, and the Lord appeared to them; 
58–67,

23
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
The Twelve are to set the officers of the Church

24
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
in order; 
68–76, Bishops serve as common judges

25
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
in Israel; 
77–84, The First Presidency and the

26
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Twelve constitute the highest court in the

27
00:00:00,0 --> 03:50:35,
Church; 
85–100, Priesthood presidents govern their respective quorums. 

28
03:50:35,0 --> 03:50:35,0
1 There are, in the church, two

29
03:50:35,0 --> 03:50:35,0
priesthoods, namely, the Melchizedek and

30
03:50:35,0 --> 04:11:38,
Aaronic, including the Levitical Priesthood.

31
04:11:38,0 --> 04:11:38,0
2 Why the first is called the

32
04:11:38,0 --> 04:11:38,0
Melchizedek Priesthood is because

33
04:11:38,0 --> 04:15:17,
Melchizedek was such a great high priest.

34
04:15:17,0 --> 04:15:17,0
3 Before his day it was

35
04:15:17,0 --> 04:15:17,0
called the Holy Priesthood,

36
04:15:17,0 --> 04:32:19,
after the Order of the Son of God.

37
04:32:19,0 --> 04:32:19,0
4 But out of respect or

38
04:32:19,0 --> 04:32:19,0
reverence to the name of

39
04:32:19,0 --> 04:32:19,0
the Supreme Being, to

40
04:32:19,0 --> 04:32:19,0
avoid the too frequent

41
04:32:19,0 --> 04:32:19,0
repetition of his name, they,

42
04:32:19,0 --> 04:32:19,0
the church, in ancient

43
04:32:19,0 --> 04:32:19,0
days, called that priesthood

44
04:32:19,0 --> 04:32:19,0
after Melchizedek, or

45
04:32:19,0 --> 04:44:55,
the Melchizedek Priesthood.

46
04:44:55,0 --> 04:44:55,0
5 All other

47
04:44:55,0 --> 04:44:55,0
authorities or offices in

48
04:44:55,0 --> 04:44:55,0
the church are

49
04:44:55,0 --> 05:19:52,
appendages to this priesthood.

50
05:19:52,0 --> 05:19:52,0
6 But there are two

51
05:19:52,0 --> 05:19:52,0
divisions or grand

52
05:19:52,0 --> 05:19:52,0
heads—one is the

53
05:19:52,0 --> 05:19:52,0
Melchizedek

54
05:19:52,0 --> 05:19:52,0
Priesthood, and the other

55
05:19:52,0 --> 05:19:52,0
is the Aaronic or

56
05:19:52,0 --> 05:30:25,
Levitical Priesthood.

57
05:30:25,0 --> 05:30:25,0
7 The office of

58
05:30:25,0 --> 05:30:25,0
an elder comes

59
05:30:25,0 --> 05:30:25,0
under the

60
05:30:25,0 --> 05:37:28,
priesthood of Melchizedek.

61
05:37:28,0 --> 05:37:28,0
8 The

62
05:37:28,0 --> 05:37:28,0
Melchizedek Priesthood

63
05:37:28,0 --> 05:37:28,0
holds the right

64
05:37:28,0 --> 05:37:28,0
of presidency,

65
05:37:28,0 --> 05:37:28,0
and has power

66
05:37:28,0 --> 05:37:28,0

67
05:37:28,0 --> 05:37:28,0
over all the

68
05:37:28,0 --> 05:37:28,0
offices in the

69
05:37:28,0 --> 05:37:28,0
church in all ages

70
05:37:28,0 --> 05:37:28,0
of the world,

71
05:37:28,0 --> 05:37:28,0
to administer in

72
05:37:28,0 --> 05:57:33,
spiritual things.

73
05:57:33,0 --> 05:57:33,0
9 The

74
05:57:33,0 --> 05:57:33,0
Presidency of the High

75
05:57:33,0 --> 05:57:33,0
Priesthood,

76
05:57:33,0 --> 05:57:33,0

77

82
06:10:37,0 --> 06:10:37,0
10 High

83
06:10:37,0 --> 06:10:37,0
priests after the

84
06:10:37,0 --> 06:10:37,0
order of the

85

06:35:37,0 --> 06:35:37,0
in his

06:35:37,0 --> 06:35:37,0
stead when the

108
06:35:37,0 --> 06:35:37,0

109
06:35:37,0 --> 06:41:42,
is not present.

110
06:41:42,0 --> 06:41:42,0
12 The high

111

117
06:41:42,0 --> 06:41:42,0

120
06:41:42,0 --> 06:41:42,0
commandments of the

121
06:41:42,0 --> 06:41:42,0

122
06:41:42,0 --> 06:41:42,0
they have a

123
06:41:42,0 --> 06:41:42,0
right to

06:41:42,0 --> 06:41:42,0
offices of

127
06:41:42,0 --> 06:41:42,0
the church

128
06:41:42,0 --> 06:41:42,0
when there

129
06:41:42,0 --> 06:41:42,0
are no

130
06:41:42,0 --> 06:48:45,
higher authorities present.

131
06:48:45,0 --> 06:48:45,0
13 The

132
06:48:45,0 --> 06:48:45,0
second

133
06:48:45,0 --> 06:48:45,0
priesthood is

134
06:48:45,0 --> 06:48:45,0
called the

06:48:45,0 --> 06:48:45,0

06:48:45,0 --> 06:48:45,0
Aaron,

137
06:48:45,0 --> 06:48:45,0
because it was

138
06:48:45,0 --> 06:48:45,0
conferred

139
06:48:45,0 --> 06:48:45,0
upon Aaron and

06:48:45,0 --> 06:48:45,0
all their

143
06:48:45,0 --> 06:49:49,
generations.

144
06:49:49,0 --> 06:49:49,0
14 Why it

145
06:49:49,0 --> 06:49:49,0
is called

146
06:49:49,0 --> 06:49:49,0

147
06:49:49,0 --> 06:49:49,0


148
06:49:49,0 --> 06:49:49,0
priesthood is

149
06:49:49,0 --> 06:49:49,0
because it is

150
06:49:49,0 --> 06:49:49,0
an

151
06:49:49,0 --> 06:49:49,0

07:12:50,0 --> 07:12:50,0
15 The

07:12:50,0 --> 07:12:50,0

162
07:12:50,0 --> 07:12:50,0
is the

164
07:12:50,0 --> 07:12:50,0
of this

07:12:50,0 --> 07:12:28,
authority of the same.

170
07:12:28,0 --> 07:12:28,0
16 No

171
07:12:28,0 --> 07:12:28,0
man has a
