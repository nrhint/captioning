00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:17,09
Section 41 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:17,09 --> 00:00:22,902
 the Prophet to the Church, at Kirtland, Ohio,

3
00:00:22,902 --> 00:00:28,714
 February 4, 1831. This revelation instructs the Prophet

4
00:00:28,714 --> 00:00:34,526
 and Church elders to pray to receive God’s “law”

5
00:00:34,526 --> 00:00:40,338
 (see 
section 42). Joseph Smith had just arrived

6
00:00:40,338 --> 00:00:46,15
 in Kirtland from New York, and Leman Copley, a

7
00:00:46,15 --> 00:00:51,962
 Church member in nearby Thompson, Ohio, “requested

8
00:00:51,962 --> 00:00:57,774
 Brother Joseph and Sidney [Rigdon] … live with him

9
00:00:57,774 --> 00:01:03,586
 and he would furnish them houses and provisions.”

10
00:01:03,586 --> 00:01:09,398
 The following revelation clarifies where Joseph and

11
00:01:09,398 --> 00:01:15,21
 Sidney should live and also calls Edward Partridge

12
00:01:15,21 --> 00:01:21,022
 to be the Church’s first bishop. 
1–3, The elders

13
00:01:21,022 --> 00:01:26,834
 will govern the Church by the spirit of

14
00:01:26,834 --> 00:01:32,646
 revelation; 
4–6, True disciples will receive and keep the

15
00:01:32,646 --> 00:01:38,458
 Lord’s law; 
7–12, Edward Partridge is named as a

16
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:44,27
 bishop unto the Church.

17
00:01:44,738 --> 00:01:50,338
1 Hearken and hear, O ye my people, saith the Lord

18
00:01:50,338 --> 00:01:55,938
 and your God, ye whom I delight to bless with the

19
00:01:55,938 --> 00:02:01,538
 greatest of all blessings, ye that hear me; and

20
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:07,138
 ye that hear me not will I curse, that have

21
00:02:07,138 --> 00:02:12,738
 professed my name, with the heaviest of all cursings

22
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:16,199
2 Hearken, O ye elders of my church whom I have

23
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:20,199
 called, behold I give unto you a commandment, that

24
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:24,199
 ye shall assemble yourselves together to agree upon

25
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:28,199
 my word

26
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:34,416
3 And by the prayer of your faith ye shall receive

27
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:40,083
 my law, that ye may know how to govern my church

28
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:45,75
 and have all things right before me

29
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:50,232
4 And I will be your ruler when I come; and

30
00:02:50,232 --> 00:02:54,899
 behold, I come quickly, and ye shall see that my law is

31
00:02:54,899 --> 00:02:59,566
 kept

32
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:03,396
5 He that receiveth my law and doeth it, the same

33
00:03:03,396 --> 00:03:07,646
 is my disciple; and he that saith he receiveth it

34
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:11,896
 and doeth it not, the same is not my disciple, and

35
00:03:11,896 --> 00:03:16,146
 shall be cast out from among you

36
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:23,647
6 For it is not meet that the things which belong

37
00:03:23,647 --> 00:03:30,397
 to the children of the kingdom should be given to

38
00:03:30,397 --> 00:03:37,147
 them that are not worthy, or to dogs, or the

39
00:03:37,147 --> 00:03:43,897
 pearls to be cast before swine

40
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:47,956
7 And again, it is meet that my servant Joseph

41
00:03:47,956 --> 00:03:52,289
 Smith, Jun., should have a house built, in which to

42
00:03:52,289 --> 00:03:56,622
 live and translate

43
00:03:56,436 --> 00:04:00,769
8 And again, it is meet that my servant Sidney

44
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:05,102
 Rigdon should live as seemeth him good, inasmuch as

45
00:04:05,102 --> 00:04:09,435
 he keepeth my commandments

46
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:13,449
9 And again, I have called my servant Edward

47
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:17,449
 Partridge; and I give a commandment, that he should be

48
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:21,449
 appointed by the voice of the church, and ordained

49
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:25,449
 a bishop unto the church, to leave his

50
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:29,449
 merchandise and to spend all his time in the labors of the

51
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:33,449
 church

52
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:37,641
10 To see to all things as it shall be appointed

53
00:04:37,641 --> 00:04:41,308
 unto him in my laws in the day that I shall give

54
00:04:41,308 --> 00:04:44,975
 them

55
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:50,084
11 And this because his heart is pure before me,

56
00:04:50,084 --> 00:04:55,417
 for he is like unto Nathanael of old, in whom there

57
00:04:55,417 --> 00:05:00,75
 is no guile

58
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:05,967
12 These words are given unto you, and they are

59
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:11,467
 pure before me; wherefore, beware how you hold them,

60
00:05:11,467 --> 00:05:16,967
 for they are to be answered upon your souls in

61
00:05:16,967 --> 00:05:22,467
 the day of judgment. Even so. Amen.
