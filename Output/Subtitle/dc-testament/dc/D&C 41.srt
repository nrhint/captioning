God’s “law” (see 
section 42). Joseph Smith had just

00:00:32,5 --> 00:00:39,0

live with him and he would furnish them houses

10
00:00:58,5 --> 00:01:05,0
and provisions.” The following revelation

12
00:01:11,5 --> 00:01:18,0

00:01:18,0 --> 00:01:24,5

by the spirit of revelation;

Edward Partridge is named as a bishop unto the Church. 

17
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:43,97
1 Hearken and hear, O ye my people, saith

18
00:01:43,97 --> 00:01:43,803
the Lord and your God, ye whom I delight

19
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:43,636
to bless with the greatest of all

20
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:43,469
blessings, ye that hear me; and ye that hear me

21
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:43,302
not will I curse, that have professed my

22
00:01:43,302 --> 00:01:43,203
name, with the heaviest of all cursings.

23
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:48,703
2 Hearken, O ye elders of my church

24
00:01:48,703 --> 00:01:54,203
whom I have called, behold I give unto you

25
00:01:54,203 --> 00:01:59,703
a commandment, that ye shall assemble

26
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:05,459
yourselves together to agree upon my word;

27
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:06,959
3 And by the prayer of your faith

28
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,459
ye shall receive my law, that ye

29
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:09,959
may know how to govern my church

30
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:11,798
and have all things right before me.

31
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:11,548
4 And I will be your ruler

32
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:11,298
when I come; and behold,

33
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:11,048
I come quickly, and ye

34
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:10,864
shall see that my law is kept.

35
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:13,114
5 He that receiveth my

36
00:02:13,114 --> 00:02:15,364
law and doeth it, the

37
00:02:15,364 --> 00:02:17,614
same is my disciple; and

38
00:02:17,614 --> 00:02:19,864
he that saith he

39
00:02:19,864 --> 00:02:22,114
receiveth it and doeth it

40
00:02:22,114 --> 00:02:24,364
not, the same is not my

41
00:02:24,364 --> 00:02:26,614
disciple, and shall be

42
00:02:26,614 --> 00:02:28,281
cast out from among you;

43
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:30,281
6 For it is not meet

44
00:02:30,281 --> 00:02:32,281
that the things which

45
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:34,281
belong to the children

46
00:02:34,281 --> 00:02:36,281
of the kingdom should

47
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,281
be given to them that

48
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:40,281
are not worthy, or to

49
00:02:40,281 --> 00:02:42,281
dogs, or the pearls to

50
00:02:42,281 --> 00:02:44,698
be cast before swine.

51
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:47,198
7 And again, it is

52
00:02:47,198 --> 00:02:49,698
meet that my

53
00:02:49,698 --> 00:02:52,198
servant Joseph Smith,

54
00:02:52,198 --> 00:02:54,698
Jun., should have a

55
00:02:54,698 --> 00:02:57,198
house built, in which

56
00:02:57,198 --> 00:02:59,012
to live and translate.

57
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,441
8 And again, it is

58
00:03:01,441 --> 00:03:03,87
meet that my

59
00:03:03,87 --> 00:03:06,299
servant Sidney Rigdon

60
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:08,728
should live as

61
00:03:08,728 --> 00:03:11,157
seemeth him good,

62
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:13,586
inasmuch as he

63
00:03:13,586 --> 00:03:16,43
keepeth my commandments.

64
00:03:16,43 --> 00:03:18,163
9 And again, I

65
00:03:18,163 --> 00:03:19,896
have called my

66
00:03:19,896 --> 00:03:21,629
servant Edward

67
00:03:21,629 --> 00:03:23,362
Partridge; and I give a

68
00:03:23,362 --> 00:03:25,095
commandment,

69
00:03:25,095 --> 00:03:26,828
that he should be

70
00:03:26,828 --> 00:03:28,561
appointed by the

71
00:03:28,561 --> 00:03:30,294
voice of the

72
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:32,027
church, and ordained a

73
00:03:32,027 --> 00:03:33,76
bishop unto the

74
00:03:33,76 --> 00:03:35,493
church, to leave

75
00:03:35,493 --> 00:03:37,226
his merchandise

76
00:03:37,226 --> 00:03:38,959
and to spend all

77
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,692
his time in the

78
00:03:40,692 --> 00:03:42,756
labors of the church;

79
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:44,613
10 To see to

80
00:03:44,613 --> 00:03:46,47
all things as

81
00:03:46,47 --> 00:03:48,327
it shall be

82
00:03:48,327 --> 00:03:50,184
appointed unto

83
00:03:50,184 --> 00:03:52,041
him in my laws

84
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:53,898
in the day that

85
00:03:53,898 --> 00:03:55,135
I shall give them.

86
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:56,579
11 And this

87
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:58,023
because his

88
00:03:58,023 --> 00:03:59,467
heart is

89
00:03:59,467 --> 00:04:00,911
pure before me,

90
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:02,355
for he is

91
00:04:02,355 --> 00:04:03,799
like unto

92
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:05,243
Nathanael of

93
00:04:05,243 --> 00:04:06,687
old, in whom

94
00:04:06,687 --> 00:04:08,515
there is no guile.

95
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,015
12 These

96
00:04:10,015 --> 00:04:11,515
words are

97
00:04:11,515 --> 00:04:13,015
given unto

98
00:04:13,015 --> 00:04:14,515
you, and they

99
00:04:14,515 --> 00:04:16,015
are pure

100
00:04:16,015 --> 00:04:17,515
before me;

101
00:04:17,515 --> 00:04:19,015
wherefore,

102
00:04:19,015 --> 00:04:20,515
beware how

103
00:04:20,515 --> 00:04:22,015
you hold

104
00:04:22,015 --> 00:04:23,515
them, for they

105
00:04:23,515 --> 00:04:25,015
are to be

106
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:26,515
answered

107
00:04:26,515 --> 00:04:28,015
upon your

108
00:04:28,015 --> 00:04:29,515
souls in the

109
00:04:29,515 --> 00:04:31,015
day of

110
00:04:31,015 --> 00:04:32,906
judgment. Even so. Amen.
