God’s “law” (see

00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
by the spirit of revelation; 
4–6, True

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
disciples will receive and keep the Lord’s law;

Edward Partridge is named as a bishop unto the Church. 

17
00:52:01,0 --> 00:52:01,0
1 Hearken and hear, O ye my people, saith

18
00:52:01,0 --> 00:52:01,0
the Lord and your God, ye whom I delight

19
00:52:01,0 --> 00:52:01,0
to bless with the greatest of all

20
00:52:01,0 --> 00:52:01,0
blessings, ye that hear me; and ye that hear me

21
00:52:01,0 --> 00:52:01,0
not will I curse, that have professed my

22
00:52:01,0 --> 00:58:42,
name, with the heaviest of all cursings.

23
00:58:42,0 --> 00:58:42,0
2 Hearken, O ye elders of my church

24
00:58:42,0 --> 00:58:42,0
whom I have called, behold I give unto you

25
00:58:42,0 --> 00:58:42,0
a commandment, that ye shall assemble

26
00:58:42,0 --> 01:02:55,
yourselves together to agree upon my word;

27
01:02:55,0 --> 01:02:55,0
3 And by the prayer of your faith

28
01:02:55,0 --> 01:02:55,0
ye shall receive my law, that ye

29
01:02:55,0 --> 01:02:55,0
may know how to govern my church

30
01:02:55,0 --> 01:05:37,
and have all things right before me.

31
01:05:37,0 --> 01:05:37,0
4 And I will be your ruler

32
01:05:37,0 --> 01:05:37,0
when I come; and behold,

33
01:05:37,0 --> 01:05:37,0
I come quickly, and ye

34
01:05:37,0 --> 01:15:47,
shall see that my law is kept.

35
01:15:47,0 --> 01:15:47,0
5 He that receiveth my

36
01:15:47,0 --> 01:15:47,0
law and doeth it, the

37
01:15:47,0 --> 01:15:47,0
same is my disciple; and

38
01:15:47,0 --> 01:15:47,0
he that saith he

39
01:15:47,0 --> 01:15:47,0
receiveth it and doeth it

40
01:15:47,0 --> 01:15:47,0
not, the same is not my

41
01:15:47,0 --> 01:15:47,0
disciple, and shall be

42
01:15:47,0 --> 01:21:58,
cast out from among you;

43
01:21:58,0 --> 01:21:58,0
6 For it is not meet

44
01:21:58,0 --> 01:21:58,0
that the things which

45
01:21:58,0 --> 01:21:58,0
belong to the children

46
01:21:58,0 --> 01:21:58,0
of the kingdom should

47
01:21:58,0 --> 01:21:58,0
be given to them that

48
01:21:58,0 --> 01:21:58,0
are not worthy, or to

49
01:21:58,0 --> 01:21:58,0
dogs, or the pearls to

50
01:21:58,0 --> 01:29:28,
be cast before swine.

51
01:29:28,0 --> 01:29:28,0
7 And again, it is

52
01:29:28,0 --> 01:29:28,0
meet that my

53
01:29:28,0 --> 01:29:28,0
servant Joseph Smith,

54
01:29:28,0 --> 01:29:28,0
Jun., should have a

55
01:29:28,0 --> 01:29:28,0
house built, in which

56
01:29:28,0 --> 01:37:40,
to live and translate.

57
01:37:40,0 --> 01:37:40,0
8 And again, it is

58
01:37:40,0 --> 01:37:40,0
meet that my

59
01:37:40,0 --> 01:37:40,0
servant Sidney Rigdon

60
01:37:40,0 --> 01:37:40,0
should live as

61
01:37:40,0 --> 01:37:40,0
seemeth him good,

62
01:37:40,0 --> 01:37:40,0
inasmuch as he

63
01:37:40,0 --> 01:50:49,
keepeth my commandments.

64
01:50:49,0 --> 01:50:49,0
9 And again, I

65
01:50:49,0 --> 01:50:49,0
have called my

66
01:50:49,0 --> 01:50:49,0
servant Edward

67
01:50:49,0 --> 01:50:49,0
Partridge; and I give a

68
01:50:49,0 --> 01:50:49,0
commandment,

69
01:50:49,0 --> 01:50:49,0
that he should be

70
01:50:49,0 --> 01:50:49,0
appointed by the

71
01:50:49,0 --> 01:50:49,0
voice of the

72
01:50:49,0 --> 01:50:49,0
church, and ordained a

73
01:50:49,0 --> 01:50:49,0
bishop unto the

74
01:50:49,0 --> 01:50:49,0
church, to leave

75
01:50:49,0 --> 01:50:49,0
his merchandise

76
01:50:49,0 --> 01:50:49,0
and to spend all

77
01:50:49,0 --> 01:50:49,0
his time in the

78
01:50:49,0 --> 01:57:44,
labors of the church;

79
01:57:44,0 --> 01:57:44,0
10 To see to

80
01:57:44,0 --> 01:57:44,0
all things as

81
01:57:44,0 --> 01:57:44,0
it shall be

82
01:57:44,0 --> 01:57:44,0
appointed unto

83
01:57:44,0 --> 01:57:44,0
him in my laws

84
01:57:44,0 --> 01:57:44,0
in the day that

85
01:57:44,0 --> 02:02:55,
I shall give them.

86
02:02:55,0 --> 02:02:55,0
11 And this

87
02:02:55,0 --> 02:02:55,0
because his

88
02:02:55,0 --> 02:02:55,0
heart is

89
02:02:55,0 --> 02:02:55,0
pure before me,

90
02:02:55,0 --> 02:02:55,0
for he is

91
02:02:55,0 --> 02:02:55,0
like unto

92
02:02:55,0 --> 02:02:55,0
Nathanael of

93
02:02:55,0 --> 02:02:55,0
old, in whom

94
02:02:55,0 --> 02:05:51,
there is no guile.

95
02:05:51,0 --> 02:05:51,0
12 These

96
02:05:51,0 --> 02:05:51,0
words are

97
02:05:51,0 --> 02:05:51,0
given unto

98
02:05:51,0 --> 02:05:51,0
you, and they

99
02:05:51,0 --> 02:05:51,0
are pure

100
02:05:51,0 --> 02:05:51,0
before me;

101
02:05:51,0 --> 02:05:51,0
wherefore,

102
02:05:51,0 --> 02:05:51,0
beware how

103
02:05:51,0 --> 02:05:51,0
you hold

104
02:05:51,0 --> 02:05:51,0
them, for they

105
02:05:51,0 --> 02:05:51,0
are to be

106
02:05:51,0 --> 02:05:51,0
answered

107
02:05:51,0 --> 02:05:51,0
upon your

108
02:05:51,0 --> 02:05:51,0
souls in the

109
02:05:51,0 --> 02:05:51,0
day of

110
02:05:51,0 --> 02:16:30,
judgment. Even so. Amen.
