00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:17,478
Section 51 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:17,478 --> 00:00:23,678
 the Prophet, at Thompson, Ohio, May 20, 1831. At

3
00:00:23,678 --> 00:00:29,878
 this time the Saints migrating from the eastern

4
00:00:29,878 --> 00:00:36,078
 states began to arrive in Ohio, and it became

5
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:42,278
 necessary to make definite arrangements for their

6
00:00:42,278 --> 00:00:48,478
 settlement. As this undertaking belonged particularly to

7
00:00:48,478 --> 00:00:54,678
 the bishop’s office, Bishop Edward Partridge sought

8
00:00:54,678 --> 00:01:00,878
 instruction on the matter, and the Prophet

9
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:07,078
 inquired of the Lord. 
1–8, Edward Partridge is

10
00:01:07,078 --> 00:01:13,278
 appointed to regulate stewardships and properties; 
9–12,

11
00:01:13,278 --> 00:01:19,478
 The Saints are to deal honestly and receive alike;

12
00:01:19,478 --> 00:01:25,678
13–15, They are to have a bishop’s storehouse

13
00:01:25,678 --> 00:01:31,878
 and to organize properties according to the Lord’s

14
00:01:31,878 --> 00:01:38,078
 law; 
16–20, Ohio is to be a temporary gathering

15
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:44,278
 place.

16
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:50,538
1 Hearken unto me, saith the Lord your God, and I

17
00:01:50,538 --> 00:01:56,138
 will speak unto my servant Edward Partridge, and

18
00:01:56,138 --> 00:02:01,738
 give unto him directions; for it must needs be that

19
00:02:01,738 --> 00:02:07,338
 he receive directions how to organize this

20
00:02:07,338 --> 00:02:12,938
 people

21
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:16,215
2 For it must needs be that they be organized

22
00:02:16,215 --> 00:02:20,215
 according to my laws; if otherwise, they will be cut

23
00:02:20,215 --> 00:02:24,215
 off

24
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:31,545
3 Wherefore, let my servant Edward Partridge, and

25
00:02:31,545 --> 00:02:38,345
 those whom he has chosen, in whom I am well

26
00:02:38,345 --> 00:02:45,145
 pleased, appoint unto this people their portions, every

27
00:02:45,145 --> 00:02:51,945
 man equal according to his family, according to

28
00:02:51,945 --> 00:02:58,745
 his circumstances and his wants and needs

29
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:04,261
4 And let my servant Edward Partridge, when he

30
00:03:04,261 --> 00:03:10,261
 shall appoint a man his portion, give unto him a

31
00:03:10,261 --> 00:03:16,261
 writing that shall secure unto him his portion, that

32
00:03:16,261 --> 00:03:22,261
 he shall hold it, even this right and this

33
00:03:22,261 --> 00:03:28,261
 inheritance in the church, until he transgresses and is

34
00:03:28,261 --> 00:03:34,261
 not accounted worthy by the voice of the church,

35
00:03:34,261 --> 00:03:40,261
 according to the laws and covenants of the church, to

36
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:46,261
 belong to the church

37
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:52,638
5 And if he shall transgress and is not accounted

38
00:03:52,638 --> 00:03:59,067
 worthy to belong to the church, he shall not have

39
00:03:59,067 --> 00:04:05,496
 power to claim that portion which he has

40
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:11,925
 consecrated unto the bishop for the poor and needy of my

41
00:04:11,925 --> 00:04:18,354
 church; therefore, he shall not retain the gift, but

42
00:04:18,354 --> 00:04:24,783
 shall only have claim on that portion that is

43
00:04:24,783 --> 00:04:31,212
 deeded unto him

44
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:36,204
6 And thus all things shall be made sure,

45
00:04:36,204 --> 00:04:41,204
 according to the laws of the land

46
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:47,214
7 And let that which belongs to this people be

47
00:04:47,214 --> 00:04:53,214
 appointed unto this people

48
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:57,793
8 And the money which is left unto this people—let

49
00:04:57,793 --> 00:05:02,543
 there be an agent appointed unto this people, to

50
00:05:02,543 --> 00:05:07,293
 take the money to provide food and raiment,

51
00:05:07,293 --> 00:05:12,043
 according to the wants of this people

52
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:21,229
9 And let every man deal honestly, and be alike

53
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:29,896
 among this people, and receive alike, that ye may be

54
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:38,563
 one, even as I have commanded you

55
00:05:38,555 --> 00:05:44,555
10 And let that which belongeth to this people not

56
00:05:44,555 --> 00:05:50,555
 be taken and given unto that of another church

57
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:54,984
11 Wherefore, if another church would receive

58
00:05:54,984 --> 00:05:59,651
 money of this church, let them pay unto this church

59
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:04,318
 again according as they shall agree

60
00:06:04,214 --> 00:06:10,547
12 And this shall be done through the bishop or

61
00:06:10,547 --> 00:06:16,88
 the agent, which shall be appointed by the voice of

62
00:06:16,88 --> 00:06:23,213
 the church

63
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:28,367
13 And again, let the bishop appoint a storehouse

64
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:32,767
 unto this church; and let all things both in money

65
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:37,167
 and in meat, which are more than is needful for

66
00:06:37,167 --> 00:06:41,567
 the wants of this people, be kept in the hands of

67
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:45,967
 the bishop

68
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:52,488
14 And let him also reserve unto himself for his

69
00:06:52,488 --> 00:06:59,488
 own wants, and for the wants of his family, as he

70
00:06:59,488 --> 00:07:06,488
 shall be employed in doing this business

71
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:12,026
15 And thus I grant unto this people a privilege

72
00:07:12,026 --> 00:07:18,026
 of organizing themselves according to my laws

73
00:07:18,054 --> 00:07:23,721
16 And I consecrate unto them this land for a

74
00:07:23,721 --> 00:07:29,388
 little season, until I, the Lord, shall provide for

75
00:07:29,388 --> 00:07:35,055
 them otherwise, and command them to go hence

76
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:43,588
17 And the hour and the day is not given unto

77
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:51,588
 them, wherefore let them act upon this land as for

78
00:07:51,588 --> 00:07:59,588
 years, and this shall turn unto them for their good

79
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:06,229
18 Behold, this shall be an example unto my

80
00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:12,562
 servant Edward Partridge, in other places, in all

81
00:08:12,562 --> 00:08:18,895
 churches
