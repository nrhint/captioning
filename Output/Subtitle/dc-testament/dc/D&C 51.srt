00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 51 Revelation given through Joseph

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Smith the Prophet, at Thompson, Ohio, May 20, 1831.

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
At this time the Saints migrating from the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
eastern states began to arrive in Ohio, and it

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
became necessary to make definite arrangements for

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
their settlement. As this undertaking belonged

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
particularly to the bishop’s office, Bishop

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Edward Partridge sought instruction on the

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
matter, and the Prophet inquired of the Lord. 
1–8,

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Edward Partridge is appointed to regulate

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
stewardships and properties; 
9–12, The Saints are to

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
deal honestly and receive alike; 
13–15, They

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
are to have a bishop’s storehouse and to

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
organize properties according to the Lord’s law;

15
00:00:00,0 --> 01:42:51,
16–20, Ohio is to be a temporary gathering place. 

16
01:42:51,0 --> 01:42:51,0
1 Hearken unto me, saith the Lord your

17
01:42:51,0 --> 01:42:51,0
God, and I will speak unto my servant

18
01:42:51,0 --> 01:42:51,0
Edward Partridge, and give unto him

19
01:42:51,0 --> 01:42:51,0
directions; for it must needs be that he

20
01:42:51,0 --> 01:38:31,
receive directions how to organize this people.

21
01:38:31,0 --> 01:38:31,0
2 For it must needs be that they

22
01:38:31,0 --> 01:38:31,0
be organized according to my laws;

23
01:38:31,0 --> 01:43:36,
if otherwise, they will be cut off.

24
01:43:36,0 --> 01:43:36,0
3 Wherefore, let my servant

25
01:43:36,0 --> 01:43:36,0
Edward Partridge, and those whom

26
01:43:36,0 --> 01:43:36,0
he has chosen, in whom I am

27
01:43:36,0 --> 01:43:36,0
well pleased, appoint unto this

28
01:43:36,0 --> 01:43:36,0
people their portions, every

29
01:43:36,0 --> 01:43:36,0
man equal according to his

30
01:43:36,0 --> 01:43:36,0
family, according to his

31
01:43:36,0 --> 02:01:37,
circumstances and his wants and needs.

32
02:01:37,0 --> 02:01:37,0
4 And let my servant Edward

33
02:01:37,0 --> 02:01:37,0
Partridge, when he shall

34
02:01:37,0 --> 02:01:37,0
appoint a man his portion, give

35
02:01:37,0 --> 02:01:37,0
unto him a writing that

36
02:01:37,0 --> 02:01:37,0
shall secure unto him his

37
02:01:37,0 --> 02:01:37,0
portion, that he shall hold it,

38
02:01:37,0 --> 02:01:37,0
even this right and this

39
02:01:37,0 --> 02:01:37,0
inheritance in the church, until

40
02:01:37,0 --> 02:01:37,0
he transgresses and is not

41
02:01:37,0 --> 02:01:37,0
accounted worthy by the

42
02:01:37,0 --> 02:01:37,0
voice of the church, according

43
02:01:37,0 --> 02:01:37,0
to the laws and covenants of

44
02:01:37,0 --> 02:11:11,
the church, to belong to the church.

45
02:11:11,0 --> 02:11:11,0
5 And if he shall

46
02:11:11,0 --> 02:11:11,0
transgress and is not accounted

47
02:11:11,0 --> 02:11:11,0
worthy to belong to the

48
02:11:11,0 --> 02:11:11,0
church, he shall not have

49
02:11:11,0 --> 02:11:11,0
power to claim that portion

50
02:11:11,0 --> 02:11:11,0
which he has consecrated

51
02:11:11,0 --> 02:11:11,0
unto the bishop for the poor

52
02:11:11,0 --> 02:11:11,0
and needy of my church;

53
02:11:11,0 --> 02:11:11,0
therefore, he shall not

54
02:11:11,0 --> 02:11:11,0
retain the gift, but shall

55
02:11:11,0 --> 02:11:11,0
only have claim on that

56
02:11:11,0 --> 02:21:43,
portion that is deeded unto him.

57
02:21:43,0 --> 02:21:43,0
6 And thus all things

58
02:21:43,0 --> 02:21:43,0
shall be made sure,

59
02:21:43,0 --> 02:21:49,
according to the laws of the land.

60
02:21:49,0 --> 02:21:49,0
7 And let that which

61
02:21:49,0 --> 02:21:49,0
belongs to this people be

62
02:21:49,0 --> 02:21:55,
appointed unto this people.

63
02:21:55,0 --> 02:21:55,0
8 And the money which

64
02:21:55,0 --> 02:21:55,0
is left unto this

65
02:21:55,0 --> 02:21:55,0
people—let there be an

66
02:21:55,0 --> 02:21:55,0
agent appointed unto this

67
02:21:55,0 --> 02:21:55,0
people, to take the

68
02:21:55,0 --> 02:21:55,0
money to provide food

69
02:21:55,0 --> 02:21:55,0
and raiment, according

70
02:21:55,0 --> 02:21:33,
to the wants of this people.

71
02:21:33,0 --> 02:21:33,0
9 And let every man

72
02:21:33,0 --> 02:21:33,0
deal honestly, and

73
02:21:33,0 --> 02:21:33,0
be alike among

74
02:21:33,0 --> 02:21:33,0
this people, and

75
02:21:33,0 --> 02:21:33,0
receive alike, that ye

76
02:21:33,0 --> 02:21:33,0
may be one, even as

77
02:21:33,0 --> 02:20:37,
I have commanded you.

78
02:20:37,0 --> 02:20:37,0
10 And let that

79
02:20:37,0 --> 02:20:37,0
which belongeth

80
02:20:37,0 --> 02:20:37,0
to this people

81
02:20:37,0 --> 02:20:37,0
not be taken and

82
02:20:37,0 --> 02:20:37,0
given unto that

83
02:20:37,0 --> 02:29:39,
of another church.

84
02:29:39,0 --> 02:29:39,0
11 Wherefore,

85
02:29:39,0 --> 02:29:39,0
if another

86
02:29:39,0 --> 02:29:39,0
church would

87
02:29:39,0 --> 02:29:39,0
receive money of

88
02:29:39,0 --> 02:29:39,0
this church,

89
02:29:39,0 --> 02:29:39,0
let them pay

90
02:29:39,0 --> 02:29:39,0
unto this church

91
02:29:39,0 --> 02:29:39,0
again

92
02:29:39,0 --> 02:56:37,
according as they shall agree;

93
02:56:37,0 --> 02:56:37,0
12 And this

94
02:56:37,0 --> 02:56:37,0
shall be done

95
02:56:37,0 --> 02:56:37,0
through the

96
02:56:37,0 --> 02:56:37,0
bishop or the

97
02:56:37,0 --> 02:56:37,0
agent, which

98
02:56:37,0 --> 02:56:37,0
shall be

99
02:56:37,0 --> 02:56:37,0
appointed by the

100
02:56:37,0 --> 03:07:37,
voice of the church.

101
03:07:37,0 --> 03:07:37,0
13 And

102
03:07:37,0 --> 03:07:37,0
again, let the

103
03:07:37,0 --> 03:07:37,0
bishop appoint

104
03:07:37,0 --> 03:07:37,0
a

105
03:07:37,0 --> 03:07:37,0
storehouse unto this

106
03:07:37,0 --> 03:07:37,0
church; and

107
03:07:37,0 --> 03:07:37,0
let all

108
03:07:37,0 --> 03:07:37,0
things both in

109
03:07:37,0 --> 03:07:37,0
money and in

110
03:07:37,0 --> 03:07:37,0
meat, which

111
03:07:37,0 --> 03:07:37,0
are more

112
03:07:37,0 --> 03:07:37,0
than is needful

113
03:07:37,0 --> 03:07:37,0
for the

114
03:07:37,0 --> 03:07:37,0
wants of this

115
03:07:37,0 --> 03:07:37,0
people, be

116
03:07:37,0 --> 03:07:37,0
kept in the

117
03:07:37,0 --> 03:40:36,
hands of the bishop.

118
03:40:36,0 --> 03:40:36,0
14 And let

119
03:40:36,0 --> 03:40:36,0
him also

120
03:40:36,0 --> 03:40:36,0
reserve unto

121
03:40:36,0 --> 03:40:36,0
himself for

122
03:40:36,0 --> 03:40:36,0
his own

123
03:40:36,0 --> 03:40:36,0
wants, and

124
03:40:36,0 --> 03:40:36,0
for the wants

125
03:40:36,0 --> 03:40:36,0
of his

126
03:40:36,0 --> 03:40:36,0
family, as he

127
03:40:36,0 --> 03:40:36,0
shall be

128
03:40:36,0 --> 03:40:36,0
employed in

129
03:40:36,0 --> 03:45:41,
doing this business.

130
03:45:41,0 --> 03:45:41,0
15 And

131
03:45:41,0 --> 03:45:41,0
thus I grant

132
03:45:41,0 --> 03:45:41,0

133
03:45:41,0 --> 03:45:41,0
people a

134
03:45:41,0 --> 03:45:41,0

135
03:45:41,0 --> 03:45:41,0
of

136
03:45:41,0 --> 03:45:41,0

137
03:45:41,0 --> 03:45:41,0

138
03:45:41,0 --> 04:26:40,
according to my laws.

139
04:26:40,0 --> 04:26:40,0
16 And I

140
04:26:40,0 --> 04:26:40,0


141
04:26:40,0 --> 04:26:40,0
consecrate unto

142
04:26:40,0 --> 04:26:40,0

143
04:26:40,0 --> 04:26:40,0

144
04:26:40,0 --> 04:26:40,0

04:26:40,0 --> 04:26:40,0

146
04:26:40,0 --> 04:26:40,0
until I,

147
04:26:40,0 --> 04:26:40,0
the Lord,

148
04:26:40,0 --> 04:26:40,0
shall

149
04:26:40,0 --> 04:26:40,0

153
04:26:40,0 --> 04:30:47,
them to go hence;

154
04:30:47,0 --> 04:30:47,0
17 And

155
04:30:47,0 --> 04:30:47,0
the hour

156
04:30:47,0 --> 04:30:47,0
and the

157
04:30:47,0 --> 04:30:47,0

04:30:47,0 --> 04:30:47,0
them,

161
04:30:47,0 --> 04:30:47,0
wherefore

162
04:30:47,0 --> 04:30:47,0
let them

163
04:30:47,0 --> 04:30:47,0
act upon

164
04:30:47,0 --> 04:30:47,0
this

165
04:30:47,0 --> 04:30:47,0
land as for

166
04:30:47,0 --> 04:30:47,0

169
04:30:47,0 --> 04:30:47,0
turn unto

170
04:30:47,0 --> 04:35:52,
them for their good.

171
04:35:52,0 --> 04:35:52,0
18

172
04:35:52,0 --> 04:35:52,0
Behold,

173
04:35:52,0 --> 04:35:52,0
this shall

Edward

204
04:51:37,0 --> 04:51:37,0
Verily,

205

04:51:37,0 --> 04:51:37,0
unto

208
04:51:37,0 --> 04:51:37,0
you, I

209
04:51:37,0 --> 04:51:37,0
am

210
04:51:37,0 --> 04:51:37,0
Jesus

211
04:51:37,0 --> 04:51:37,0
Christ,

212
04:51:37,0 --> 04:51:37,0
who

213
04:51:37,0 --> 04:51:37,0


214
04:51:37,0 --> 04:51:37,0
cometh

219
04:51:37,0 --> 04:51:37,0


220
04:51:37,0 --> 05:08:38,
think not. Even so. Amen.
