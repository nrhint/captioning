00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:02,267
Section 51 Revelation given through Joseph

2
00:00:02,267 --> 00:00:04,534
Smith the Prophet, at Thompson, Ohio, May 20, 1831.

3
00:00:04,534 --> 00:00:06,801
At this time the Saints migrating from the

4
00:00:06,801 --> 00:00:09,068
eastern states began to arrive in Ohio, and it

5
00:00:09,068 --> 00:00:11,335
became necessary to make definite arrangements for

6
00:00:11,335 --> 00:00:13,602
their settlement. As this undertaking belonged

7
00:00:13,602 --> 00:00:15,869
particularly to the bishop’s office, Bishop

8
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:18,136
Edward Partridge sought instruction on the

9
00:00:18,136 --> 00:00:20,403
matter, and the Prophet inquired of the Lord. 
1–8,

10
00:00:20,403 --> 00:00:22,67
Edward Partridge is appointed to regulate

11
00:00:22,67 --> 00:00:24,937
stewardships and properties; 
9–12, The Saints are to

12
00:00:24,937 --> 00:00:27,204
deal honestly and receive alike; 
13–15, They

13
00:00:27,204 --> 00:00:29,471
are to have a bishop’s storehouse and to

14
00:00:29,471 --> 00:00:31,738
organize properties according to the Lord’s law;

15
00:00:31,738 --> 00:00:34,985
16–20, Ohio is to be a temporary gathering place. 

16
00:00:34,985 --> 00:00:48,985
1 Hearken unto me, saith the Lord your

17
00:00:48,985 --> 00:01:02,985
God, and I will speak unto my servant

18
00:01:02,985 --> 00:01:16,985
Edward Partridge, and give unto him

19
00:01:16,985 --> 00:01:30,985
directions; for it must needs be that he

20
00:01:30,985 --> 00:01:44,004
receive directions how to organize this people.

21
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:47,004
2 For it must needs be that they

22
00:01:47,004 --> 00:01:50,004
be organized according to my laws;

23
00:01:50,004 --> 00:01:53,063
if otherwise, they will be cut off.

24
00:01:53,063 --> 00:01:55,313
3 Wherefore, let my servant

25
00:01:55,313 --> 00:01:57,563
Edward Partridge, and those whom

26
00:01:57,563 --> 00:01:59,813
he has chosen, in whom I am

27
00:01:59,813 --> 00:02:02,063
well pleased, appoint unto this

28
00:02:02,063 --> 00:02:04,313
people their portions, every

29
00:02:04,313 --> 00:02:06,563
man equal according to his

30
00:02:06,563 --> 00:02:08,813
family, according to his

31
00:02:08,813 --> 00:02:11,615
circumstances and his wants and needs.

32
00:02:11,615 --> 00:02:12,307
4 And let my servant Edward

33
00:02:12,307 --> 00:02:12,999
Partridge, when he shall

34
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:13,691
appoint a man his portion, give

35
00:02:13,691 --> 00:02:14,383
unto him a writing that

36
00:02:14,383 --> 00:02:15,075
shall secure unto him his

37
00:02:15,075 --> 00:02:15,767
portion, that he shall hold it,

38
00:02:15,767 --> 00:02:16,459
even this right and this

39
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:17,151
inheritance in the church, until

40
00:02:17,151 --> 00:02:17,843
he transgresses and is not

41
00:02:17,843 --> 00:02:18,535
accounted worthy by the

42
00:02:18,535 --> 00:02:19,227
voice of the church, according

43
00:02:19,227 --> 00:02:19,919
to the laws and covenants of

44
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:20,657
the church, to belong to the church.

45
00:02:20,657 --> 00:02:20,324
5 And if he shall

46
00:02:20,324 --> 00:02:19,991
transgress and is not accounted

47
00:02:19,991 --> 00:02:19,658
worthy to belong to the

48
00:02:19,658 --> 00:02:19,325
church, he shall not have

49
00:02:19,325 --> 00:02:18,992
power to claim that portion

50
00:02:18,992 --> 00:02:18,659
which he has consecrated

51
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:18,326
unto the bishop for the poor

52
00:02:18,326 --> 00:02:17,993
and needy of my church;

53
00:02:17,993 --> 00:02:17,66
therefore, he shall not

54
00:02:17,66 --> 00:02:17,327
retain the gift, but shall

55
00:02:17,327 --> 00:02:16,994
only have claim on that

56
00:02:16,994 --> 00:02:16,32
portion that is deeded unto him.

57
00:02:16,32 --> 00:02:18,653
6 And thus all things

58
00:02:18,653 --> 00:02:20,986
shall be made sure,

59
00:02:20,986 --> 00:02:23,377
according to the laws of the land.

60
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:28,377
7 And let that which

61
00:02:28,377 --> 00:02:33,377
belongs to this people be

62
00:02:33,377 --> 00:02:38,408
appointed unto this people.

63
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:38,533
8 And the money which

64
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:38,658
is left unto this

65
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:38,783
people—let there be an

66
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:38,908
agent appointed unto this

67
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:39,033
people, to take the

68
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:39,158
money to provide food

69
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:39,283
and raiment, according

70
00:02:39,283 --> 00:02:39,476
to the wants of this people.

71
00:02:39,476 --> 00:02:42,047
9 And let every man

72
00:02:42,047 --> 00:02:44,618
deal honestly, and

73
00:02:44,618 --> 00:02:47,189
be alike among

74
00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:49,76
this people, and

75
00:02:49,76 --> 00:02:52,331
receive alike, that ye

76
00:02:52,331 --> 00:02:54,902
may be one, even as

77
00:02:54,902 --> 00:02:57,527
I have commanded you.

78
00:02:57,527 --> 00:02:59,36
10 And let that

79
00:02:59,36 --> 00:03:01,193
which belongeth

80
00:03:01,193 --> 00:03:03,026
to this people

81
00:03:03,026 --> 00:03:04,859
not be taken and

82
00:03:04,859 --> 00:03:06,692

83
00:03:06,692 --> 00:03:08,538
of another church.

84
00:03:08,538 --> 00:03:10,649
11 Wherefore,

85
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:12,76
if another

86
00:03:12,76 --> 00:03:14,871
church would

87
00:03:14,871 --> 00:03:16,982
receive money of

88
00:03:16,982 --> 00:03:19,093
this church,

89
00:03:19,093 --> 00:03:21,204
let them pay

90
00:03:21,204 --> 00:03:23,315

91
00:03:23,315 --> 00:03:25,426
again

92
00:03:25,426 --> 00:03:27,541
according as they shall agree;

93
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,291
12 And this

94
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:33,041
shall be done

95
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:35,791
through the

96
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:38,541
bishop or the

97
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:41,291
agent, which

98
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:44,041
shall be

99
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:46,791
appointed by the

100
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:49,613
voice of the church.

101
00:03:49,613 --> 00:03:49,378
13 And

102
00:03:49,378 --> 00:03:49,143
again, let the

103
00:03:49,143 --> 00:03:48,908
bishop appoint

104
00:03:48,908 --> 00:03:48,673

00:03:48,673 --> 00:03:48,438
storehouse unto this

106
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:48,203
church; and

107
00:03:48,203 --> 00:03:47,968
let all

108
00:03:47,968 --> 00:03:47,733

109
00:03:47,733 --> 00:03:47,498
money and in

110
00:03:47,498 --> 00:03:47,263
meat, which

111
00:03:47,263 --> 00:03:47,028
are more

112
00:03:47,028 --> 00:03:46,793
than is needful

113
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:46,558
for the

114
00:03:46,558 --> 00:03:46,323
wants of this

115
00:03:46,323 --> 00:03:46,088
people, be

00:03:46,088 --> 00:03:45,853
kept in the

117
00:03:45,853 --> 00:03:45,275
hands of the bishop.

118
00:03:45,275 --> 00:03:45,442
14 And let

119
00:03:45,442 --> 00:03:45,609
him also

120
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:45,776
reserve unto

121
00:03:45,776 --> 00:03:45,943

his own

123
00:03:46,11 --> 00:03:46,277
wants, and

124
00:03:46,277 --> 00:03:46,444
for the wants

125
00:03:46,444 --> 00:03:46,611
of his

126
00:03:46,611 --> 00:03:46,778
family, as he

127
00:03:46,778 --> 00:03:46,945

128
00:03:46,945 --> 00:03:47,112
employed in

129
00:03:47,112 --> 00:03:47,844
doing this business.

130
00:03:47,844 --> 00:03:49,955
15 And

131
00:03:49,955 --> 00:03:52,066
thus I grant

132
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:54,177

00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:09,25
the Lord,

148
00:04:09,25 --> 00:04:09,517
shall

149
00:04:09,517 --> 00:04:09,784

154
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:11,66
17 And

155
00:04:11,66 --> 00:04:12,836
the hour

156
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,012

00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:19,892
wherefore

162
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:21,068
let them
