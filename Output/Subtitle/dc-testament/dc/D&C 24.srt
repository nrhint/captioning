1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:07,231
Section 24 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:07,231 --> 00:00:14,462
Prophet and Oliver Cowdery, at Harmony,

3
00:00:14,462 --> 00:00:21,693
Pennsylvania, July 1830. Though less than four months

4
00:00:21,693 --> 00:00:28,924
had elapsed since the Church was organized,

5
00:00:28,924 --> 00:00:36,155
persecution had become intense, and the leaders had to

6
00:00:36,155 --> 00:00:43,386
seek safety in partial seclusion. The following

7
00:00:43,386 --> 00:00:50,617
three revelations were given at this time to

8
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:57,848
strengthen, encourage, and instruct them. 
1–9,

9
00:00:57,848 --> 00:01:05,079
Joseph Smith is called to translate, preach, and

10
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:12,31
expound scriptures; 
10–12, Oliver Cowdery is

11
00:01:12,31 --> 00:01:19,541
called to preach the gospel; 
13–19, The law is

12
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:26,772
revealed relative to miracles, cursings, casting

13
00:01:26,772 --> 00:01:34,027
off the dust of one’s feet, and going without purse or scrip. 

14
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:35,313
1 Behold, thou wast called and chosen to

15
00:01:35,313 --> 00:01:36,599
write the Book of Mormon, and to my

16
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:37,885
ministry; and I have lifted thee up out of

17
00:01:37,885 --> 00:01:39,171
thine afflictions, and have counseled thee,

18
00:01:39,171 --> 00:01:40,457
that thou hast been delivered from all

19
00:01:40,457 --> 00:01:41,743
thine enemies, and thou hast been delivered

20
00:01:41,743 --> 00:01:43,937
from the powers of Satan and from darkness!

21
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:56,27
2 Nevertheless, thou art not

22
00:01:56,27 --> 00:02:08,603
excusable in thy transgressions;

23
00:02:08,603 --> 00:02:20,24
nevertheless, go thy way and sin no more.

24
00:02:20,24 --> 00:02:22,24
3 Magnify thine office; and

25
00:02:22,24 --> 00:02:24,24
after thou hast sowed thy

26
00:02:24,24 --> 00:02:26,24
fields and secured them, go

27
00:02:26,24 --> 00:02:28,24
speedily unto the church which is

28
00:02:28,24 --> 00:02:30,24
in Colesville, Fayette, and

29
00:02:30,24 --> 00:02:32,24
Manchester, and they shall

30
00:02:32,24 --> 00:02:34,24
support thee; and I will bless

31
00:02:34,24 --> 00:02:36,656
them both spiritually and temporally;

32
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:47,323
4 But if they receive thee

33
00:02:47,323 --> 00:02:57,99
not, I will send upon them a

34
00:02:57,99 --> 00:03:08,088
cursing instead of a blessing.

35
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:09,802
5 And thou shalt

36
00:03:09,802 --> 00:03:11,516
continue in calling upon God in

37
00:03:11,516 --> 00:03:13,23
my name, and writing

38
00:03:13,23 --> 00:03:14,944
the things which shall be

39
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,658
given thee by the

40
00:03:16,658 --> 00:03:18,372
Comforter, and expounding all

41
00:03:18,372 --> 00:03:20,467
scriptures unto the church.

42
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:23,467
6 And it shall be given

43
00:03:23,467 --> 00:03:26,467
thee in the very

44
00:03:26,467 --> 00:03:29,467
moment what thou shalt speak

45
00:03:29,467 --> 00:03:32,467
and write, and they

46
00:03:32,467 --> 00:03:35,467
shall hear it, or I will

47
00:03:35,467 --> 00:03:38,467
send unto them a

48
00:03:38,467 --> 00:03:41,822
cursing instead of a blessing.

49
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:47,072
7 For thou shalt

50
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:52,322
devote all thy service in

51
00:03:52,322 --> 00:03:57,572
Zion; and in this

52
00:03:57,572 --> 00:04:02,175
thou shalt have strength.

53
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:03,889
8 Be patient in

54
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:05,603
afflictions, for

55
00:04:05,603 --> 00:04:07,317
thou shalt have many;

56
00:04:07,317 --> 00:04:09,031
but endure them,

57
00:04:09,031 --> 00:04:10,745
for, lo, I am with

58
00:04:10,745 --> 00:04:12,459
thee, even unto

59
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:14,554
the end of thy days.

60
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:15,754
9 And in temporal

61
00:04:15,754 --> 00:04:16,954
labors thou

62
00:04:16,954 --> 00:04:18,154
shalt not have

63
00:04:18,154 --> 00:04:19,354
strength, for this is

64
00:04:19,354 --> 00:04:20,554
not thy calling.

65
00:04:20,554 --> 00:04:21,754
Attend to thy

66
00:04:21,754 --> 00:04:22,954
calling and thou

67
00:04:22,954 --> 00:04:24,154
shalt have wherewith

68
00:04:24,154 --> 00:04:25,354
to magnify thine

69
00:04:25,354 --> 00:04:26,554
office, and to

70
00:04:26,554 --> 00:04:27,754
expound all

71
00:04:27,754 --> 00:04:28,954
scriptures, and continue

72
00:04:28,954 --> 00:04:30,154
in laying on of

73
00:04:30,154 --> 00:04:31,354
the hands and

74
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:32,906
confirming the churches.

75
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:35,823
10 And thy

76
00:04:35,823 --> 00:04:38,74
brother Oliver shall

77
00:04:38,74 --> 00:04:41,657
continue in

78
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:44,574
bearing my name

79
00:04:44,574 --> 00:04:47,491
before the world,

80
00:04:47,491 --> 00:04:50,408
and also to the

81
00:04:50,408 --> 00:04:53,325
church. And he

82
00:04:53,325 --> 00:04:56,242
shall not suppose

83
00:04:56,242 --> 00:04:59,159
that he can say

84
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:02,076
enough in my

85
00:05:02,076 --> 00:05:04,993
cause; and lo, I am

86
00:05:04,993 --> 00:05:07,207
with him to the end.

87
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:11,636
11 In me he

88
00:05:11,636 --> 00:05:16,065
shall have glory,

89
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:20,494
and not of

90
00:05:20,494 --> 00:05:24,923
himself, whether in

91
00:05:24,923 --> 00:05:29,352
weakness or in

92
00:05:29,352 --> 00:05:33,781
strength,

93
00:05:33,781 --> 00:05:38,638
whether in bonds or free;

94
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:40,209
12 And at all

95
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:41,78
times, and in

96
00:05:41,78 --> 00:05:43,351
all places, he

97
00:05:43,351 --> 00:05:44,922
shall open

98
00:05:44,922 --> 00:05:46,493
his mouth and

99
00:05:46,493 --> 00:05:48,064
declare my

100
00:05:48,064 --> 00:05:49,635
gospel as with the

101
00:05:49,635 --> 00:05:51,206
voice of a

102
00:05:51,206 --> 00:05:52,777
trump, both day

103
00:05:52,777 --> 00:05:54,348
and night. And

104
00:05:54,348 --> 00:05:55,919
I will give

105
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,49
unto him

106
00:05:57,49 --> 00:05:59,061
strength such as is

107
00:05:59,061 --> 00:06:00,894
not known among men.

108
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:02,394
13 Require

109
00:06:02,394 --> 00:06:03,894
not miracles,

110
00:06:03,894 --> 00:06:05,394
except I shall

111
00:06:05,394 --> 00:06:06,894
command you,

112
00:06:06,894 --> 00:06:08,394
except

113
00:06:08,394 --> 00:06:09,894
casting out

114
00:06:09,894 --> 00:06:11,394
devils, healing the

115
00:06:11,394 --> 00:06:12,894
sick, and

116
00:06:12,894 --> 00:06:14,394
against

117
00:06:14,394 --> 00:06:15,894
poisonous serpents,

118
00:06:15,894 --> 00:06:17,394
and against

119
00:06:17,394 --> 00:06:18,745
deadly poisons;

120
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:19,531
14 And these

121
00:06:19,531 --> 00:06:20,317
things ye

122
00:06:20,317 --> 00:06:21,103
shall not do,

123
00:06:21,103 --> 00:06:21,889
except it

124
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:22,675
be required

125
00:06:22,675 --> 00:06:23,461
of you by

126
00:06:23,461 --> 00:06:24,247
them who desire

127
00:06:24,247 --> 00:06:25,033
it, that

128
00:06:25,033 --> 00:06:25,819
the scriptures

129
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:26,605
might be

130
00:06:26,605 --> 00:06:27,391
fulfilled; for

131
00:06:27,391 --> 00:06:28,177
ye shall do

132
00:06:28,177 --> 00:06:28,963
according

133
00:06:28,963 --> 00:06:29,122
to that which is written.

134
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:30,422
15 And in

135
00:06:30,422 --> 00:06:31,722
whatsoever

136
00:06:31,722 --> 00:06:33,022
place ye

137
00:06:33,022 --> 00:06:34,322
shall enter,

138
00:06:34,322 --> 00:06:35,622
and they

139
00:06:35,622 --> 00:06:36,922
receive you

140
00:06:36,922 --> 00:06:38,222
not in my

141
00:06:38,222 --> 00:06:39,522
name, ye shall

142
00:06:39,522 --> 00:06:40,822
leave a

143
00:06:40,822 --> 00:06:42,122
cursing

144
00:06:42,122 --> 00:06:43,422
instead of a

145
00:06:43,422 --> 00:06:44,722
blessing, by

146
00:06:44,722 --> 00:06:46,022
casting off

147
00:06:46,022 --> 00:06:47,322
the dust of

148
00:06:47,322 --> 00:06:48,622
your feet

149
00:06:48,622 --> 00:06:49,922
against

150
00:06:49,922 --> 00:06:51,222
them as a

151
00:06:51,222 --> 00:06:52,522
testimony, and

152
00:06:52,522 --> 00:06:53,822
cleansing

153
00:06:53,822 --> 00:06:55,448
your feet by the wayside.

154
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:56,185
16 And it

155
00:06:56,185 --> 00:06:56,922
shall come

156
00:06:56,922 --> 00:06:57,659
to pass

157
00:06:57,659 --> 00:06:58,396
that

158
00:06:58,396 --> 00:06:59,133
whosoever shall

159
00:06:59,133 --> 00:06:59,87
lay their

160
00:06:59,87 --> 00:07:00,607
hands upon

161
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,344
you by

162
00:07:01,344 --> 00:07:02,081
violence, ye

163
00:07:02,081 --> 00:07:02,818
shall

164
00:07:02,818 --> 00:07:03,555
command to be

165
00:07:03,555 --> 00:07:04,292
smitten

166
00:07:04,292 --> 00:07:05,029
in my name;

167
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:05,766
and,

168
00:07:05,766 --> 00:07:06,503
behold, I will

169
00:07:06,503 --> 00:07:07,24
smite

170
00:07:07,24 --> 00:07:07,977
them

171
00:07:07,977 --> 00:07:08,714
according to your

172
00:07:08,714 --> 00:07:09,729
words, in mine own due time.

173
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,586
17 And

174
00:07:11,586 --> 00:07:13,443
whosoever

175
00:07:13,443 --> 00:07:15,3
shall go to

176
00:07:15,3 --> 00:07:17,157
law with

177
00:07:17,157 --> 00:07:19,014
thee shall

178
00:07:19,014 --> 00:07:20,871
be cursed

179
00:07:20,871 --> 00:07:22,108
by the law.

180
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,199
18 And

181
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,29
thou shalt

182
00:07:24,29 --> 00:07:25,381
take no

183
00:07:25,381 --> 00:07:26,472
purse nor

184
00:07:26,472 --> 00:07:27,563
scrip,

185
00:07:27,563 --> 00:07:28,654
neither

186
00:07:28,654 --> 00:07:29,745
staves,

187
00:07:29,745 --> 00:07:30,836
neither two

188
00:07:30,836 --> 00:07:31,927
coats, for

189
00:07:31,927 --> 00:07:33,018
the

190
00:07:33,018 --> 00:07:34,109
church shall

191
00:07:34,109 --> 00:07:35,2
give unto

192
00:07:35,2 --> 00:07:36,291
thee in

193
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:37,382
the very

194
00:07:37,382 --> 00:07:38,473
hour what

195
00:07:38,473 --> 00:07:39,564
thou

196
00:07:39,564 --> 00:07:40,655
needest for

197
00:07:40,655 --> 00:07:41,746
food and

198
00:07:41,746 --> 00:07:42,837
for

199
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:43,928
raiment, and

200
00:07:43,928 --> 00:07:45,019
for shoes

201
00:07:45,019 --> 00:07:46,499
