1
00:00:23,69 --> 00:00:29,921
Section 24 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:29,921 --> 00:00:36,152
 Prophet and Oliver Cowdery, at Harmony,

3
00:00:36,152 --> 00:00:42,383
 Pennsylvania, July 1830. Though less than four months had

4
00:00:42,383 --> 00:00:48,614
 elapsed since the Church was organized, persecution

5
00:00:48,614 --> 00:00:54,845
 had become intense, and the leaders had to seek

6
00:00:54,845 --> 00:01:01,076
 safety in partial seclusion. The following three

7
00:01:01,076 --> 00:01:07,307
 revelations were given at this time to strengthen,

8
00:01:07,307 --> 00:01:13,538
 encourage, and instruct them. 
1–9, Joseph Smith is

9
00:01:13,538 --> 00:01:19,769
 called to translate, preach, and expound scriptures;

10
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:26,0
10–12, Oliver Cowdery is called to preach the

11
00:01:26,0 --> 00:01:32,231
 gospel; 
13–19, The law is revealed relative to

12
00:01:32,231 --> 00:01:38,462
 miracles, cursings, casting off the dust of one’s

13
00:01:38,462 --> 00:01:44,693
 feet, and going without purse or scrip.

14
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:50,671
1 Behold, thou wast called and chosen to write the

15
00:01:50,671 --> 00:01:56,838
 Book of Mormon, and to my ministry; and I have

16
00:01:56,838 --> 00:02:03,005
 lifted thee up out of thine afflictions, and have

17
00:02:03,005 --> 00:02:09,172
 counseled thee, that thou hast been delivered from

18
00:02:09,172 --> 00:02:15,339
 all thine enemies, and thou hast been delivered

19
00:02:15,339 --> 00:02:21,506
 from the powers of Satan and from darkness

20
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:26,774
2 Nevertheless, thou art not excusable in thy

21
00:02:26,774 --> 00:02:32,107
 transgressions; nevertheless, go thy way and sin no

22
00:02:32,107 --> 00:02:37,44
 more

23
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:43,991
3 Magnify thine office; and after thou hast sowed

24
00:02:43,991 --> 00:02:50,191
 thy fields and secured them, go speedily unto the

25
00:02:50,191 --> 00:02:56,391
 church which is in Colesville, Fayette, and

26
00:02:56,391 --> 00:03:02,591
 Manchester, and they shall support thee; and I will

27
00:03:02,591 --> 00:03:08,791
 bless them both spiritually and temporally

28
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:14,988
4 But if they receive thee not, I will send upon

29
00:03:14,988 --> 00:03:21,488
 them a cursing instead of a blessing

30
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:27,018
5 And thou shalt continue in calling upon God in

31
00:03:27,018 --> 00:03:32,768
 my name, and writing the things which shall be

32
00:03:32,768 --> 00:03:38,518
 given thee by the Comforter, and expounding all

33
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:44,268
 scriptures unto the church

34
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:49,241
6 And it shall be given thee in the very moment

35
00:03:49,241 --> 00:03:53,991
 what thou shalt speak and write, and they shall hear

36
00:03:53,991 --> 00:03:58,741
 it, or I will send unto them a cursing instead of

37
00:03:58,741 --> 00:04:03,491
 a blessing

38
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:09,076
7 For thou shalt devote all thy service in Zion;

39
00:04:09,076 --> 00:04:15,076
 and in this thou shalt have strength

40
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:21,421
8 Be patient in afflictions, for thou shalt have

41
00:04:21,421 --> 00:04:27,754
 many; but endure them, for, lo, I am with thee,

42
00:04:27,754 --> 00:04:34,087
 even unto the end of thy days

43
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:40,008
9 And in temporal labors thou shalt not have

44
00:04:40,008 --> 00:04:45,675
 strength, for this is not thy calling. Attend to thy

45
00:04:45,675 --> 00:04:51,342
 calling and thou shalt have wherewith to magnify

46
00:04:51,342 --> 00:04:57,009
 thine office, and to expound all scriptures, and

47
00:04:57,009 --> 00:05:02,676
 continue in laying on of the hands and confirming the

48
00:05:02,676 --> 00:05:08,343
 churches

49
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:16,559
10 And thy brother Oliver shall continue in

50
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:24,309
 bearing my name before the world, and also to the

51
00:05:24,309 --> 00:05:32,059
 church. And he shall not suppose that he can say enough

52
00:05:32,059 --> 00:05:39,809
 in my cause; and lo, I am with him to the end

53
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:46,939
11 In me he shall have glory, and not of himself,

54
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:54,606
 whether in weakness or in strength, whether in

55
00:05:54,606 --> 00:06:02,273
 bonds or free

56
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:07,629
12 And at all times, and in all places, he shall

57
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:13,029
 open his mouth and declare my gospel as with the

58
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:18,429
 voice of a trump, both day and night. And I will

59
00:06:18,429 --> 00:06:23,829
 give unto him strength such as is not known among

60
00:06:23,829 --> 00:06:29,229
 men

61
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:36,689
13 Require not miracles, except I shall command

62
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:43,689
 you, except casting out devils, healing the sick,

63
00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:50,689
 and against poisonous serpents, and against deadly

64
00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:57,689
 poisons

65
00:06:57,15 --> 00:07:02,4
14 And these things ye shall not do, except it be

66
00:07:02,4 --> 00:07:07,65
 required of you by them who desire it, that the

67
00:07:07,65 --> 00:07:12,9
 scriptures might be fulfilled; for ye shall do

68
00:07:12,9 --> 00:07:18,15
 according to that which is written

69
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:24,438
15 And in whatsoever place ye shall enter, and

70
00:07:24,438 --> 00:07:30,238
 they receive you not in my name, ye shall leave a

71
00:07:30,238 --> 00:07:36,038
 cursing instead of a blessing, by casting off the

72
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:41,838
 dust of your feet against them as a testimony, and

73
00:07:41,838 --> 00:07:47,638
 cleansing your feet by the wayside

74
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:52,167
16 And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall

75
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:56,967
 lay their hands upon you by violence, ye shall

76
00:07:56,967 --> 00:08:01,767
 command to be smitten in my name; and, behold, I will

77
00:08:01,767 --> 00:08:06,567
 smite them according to your words, in mine own

78
00:08:06,567 --> 00:08:11,367
 due time

79
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:17,891
17 And whosoever shall go to law with thee shall

80
00:08:17,891 --> 00:08:23,891
 be cursed by the law

81
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:29,636
18 And thou shalt take no purse nor scrip, neither

82
00:08:29,636 --> 00:08:35,636
 staves, neither two coats, for the church shall

83
00:08:35,636 --> 00:08:41,636
 give unto thee in the very hour what thou needest

84
00:08:41,636 --> 00:08:47,636
 for food and for raiment, and for shoes and for

85
00:08:47,636 --> 00:08:53,636
 money, and for scrip

86
00:08:53,867 --> 00:09:01,667
19 For thou art called to prune my vineyard with a

87
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:09,467
 mighty pruning, yea, even for the last time; yea,

88
00:09:09,467 --> 00:09:17,267
 and also all those whom thou hast ordained, and

89
00:09:17,267 --> 00:09:25,067
 they shall do even according to this pattern. Amen.

90
00:09:25,067 --> 00:09:32,867
