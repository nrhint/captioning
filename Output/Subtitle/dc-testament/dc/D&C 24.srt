00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 24 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Prophet and Oliver Cowdery, at Harmony,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Pennsylvania, July 1830. Though less than four months

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
had elapsed since the Church was organized,

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
persecution had become intense, and the leaders had to

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
seek safety in partial seclusion. The following

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
three revelations were given at this time to

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
strengthen, encourage, and instruct them. 
1–9,

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Joseph Smith is called to translate, preach, and

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
expound scriptures; 
10–12, Oliver Cowdery is

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
called to preach the gospel; 
13–19, The law is

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
revealed relative to miracles, cursings, casting

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:52:01,
off the dust of one’s feet, and going without purse or scrip. 

14
00:52:01,0 --> 00:52:01,0
1 Behold, thou wast called and chosen to

15
00:52:01,0 --> 00:52:01,0
write the Book of Mormon, and to my

16
00:52:01,0 --> 00:52:01,0
ministry; and I have lifted thee up out of

17
00:52:01,0 --> 00:52:01,0
thine afflictions, and have counseled thee,

18
00:52:01,0 --> 00:52:01,0
that thou hast been delivered from all

19
00:52:01,0 --> 00:52:01,0
thine enemies, and thou hast been delivered

20
00:52:01,0 --> 00:58:42,
from the powers of Satan and from darkness!

21
00:58:42,0 --> 00:58:42,0
2 Nevertheless, thou art not

22
00:58:42,0 --> 00:58:42,0
excusable in thy transgressions;

23
00:58:42,0 --> 01:08:51,
nevertheless, go thy way and sin no more.

24
01:08:51,0 --> 01:08:51,0
3 Magnify thine office; and

25
01:08:51,0 --> 01:08:51,0
after thou hast sowed thy

26
01:08:51,0 --> 01:08:51,0
fields and secured them, go

27
01:08:51,0 --> 01:08:51,0
speedily unto the church which is

28
01:08:51,0 --> 01:08:51,0
in Colesville, Fayette, and

29
01:08:51,0 --> 01:08:51,0
Manchester, and they shall

30
01:08:51,0 --> 01:08:51,0
support thee; and I will bless

31
01:08:51,0 --> 01:10:03,
them both spiritually and temporally;

32
01:10:03,0 --> 01:10:03,0
4 But if they receive thee

33
01:10:03,0 --> 01:10:03,0
not, I will send upon them a

34
01:10:03,0 --> 01:18:15,
cursing instead of a blessing.

35
01:18:15,0 --> 01:18:15,0
5 And thou shalt

36
01:18:15,0 --> 01:18:15,0
continue in calling upon God in

37
01:18:15,0 --> 01:18:15,0
my name, and writing

38
01:18:15,0 --> 01:18:15,0
the things which shall be

39
01:18:15,0 --> 01:18:15,0
given thee by the

40
01:18:15,0 --> 01:18:15,0
Comforter, and expounding all

41
01:18:15,0 --> 01:33:57,
scriptures unto the church.

42
01:33:57,0 --> 01:33:57,0
6 And it shall be given

43
01:33:57,0 --> 01:33:57,0
thee in the very

44
01:33:57,0 --> 01:33:57,0
moment what thou shalt speak

45
01:33:57,0 --> 01:33:57,0
and write, and they

46
01:33:57,0 --> 01:33:57,0
shall hear it, or I will

47
01:33:57,0 --> 01:33:57,0
send unto them a

48
01:33:57,0 --> 01:40:08,
cursing instead of a blessing.

49
01:40:08,0 --> 01:40:08,0
7 For thou shalt

50
01:40:08,0 --> 01:40:08,0
devote all thy service in

51
01:40:08,0 --> 01:40:08,0
Zion; and in this

52
01:40:08,0 --> 01:51:51,
thou shalt have strength.

53
01:51:51,0 --> 01:51:51,0
8 Be patient in

54
01:51:51,0 --> 01:51:51,0
afflictions, for

55
01:51:51,0 --> 01:51:51,0
thou shalt have many;

56
01:51:51,0 --> 01:51:51,0
but endure them,

57
01:51:51,0 --> 01:51:51,0
for, lo, I am with

58
01:51:51,0 --> 01:51:51,0
thee, even unto

59
01:51:51,0 --> 01:59:49,
the end of thy days.

60
01:59:49,0 --> 01:59:49,0
9 And in temporal

61
01:59:49,0 --> 01:59:49,0
labors thou

62
01:59:49,0 --> 01:59:49,0
shalt not have

63
01:59:49,0 --> 01:59:49,0
strength, for this is

64
01:59:49,0 --> 01:59:49,0
not thy calling.

65
01:59:49,0 --> 01:59:49,0
Attend to thy

66
01:59:49,0 --> 01:59:49,0
calling and thou

67
01:59:49,0 --> 01:59:49,0
shalt have wherewith

68
01:59:49,0 --> 01:59:49,0
to magnify thine

69
01:59:49,0 --> 01:59:49,0
office, and to

70
01:59:49,0 --> 01:59:49,0
expound all

71
01:59:49,0 --> 01:59:49,0
scriptures, and continue

72
01:59:49,0 --> 01:59:49,0
in laying on of

73
01:59:49,0 --> 01:59:49,0
the hands and

74
01:59:49,0 --> 02:07:19,
confirming the churches.

75
02:07:19,0 --> 02:07:19,0
10 And thy

76
02:07:19,0 --> 02:07:19,0
brother Oliver shall

77
02:07:19,0 --> 02:07:19,0
continue in

78
02:07:19,0 --> 02:07:19,0
bearing my name

79
02:07:19,0 --> 02:07:19,0
before the world,

80
02:07:19,0 --> 02:07:19,0
and also to the

81
02:07:19,0 --> 02:07:19,0
church. And he

82
02:07:19,0 --> 02:07:19,0
shall not suppose

83
02:07:19,0 --> 02:07:19,0
that he can say

84
02:07:19,0 --> 02:07:19,0
enough in my

85
02:07:19,0 --> 02:07:19,0
cause; and lo, I am

86
02:07:19,0 --> 02:09:31,
with him to the end.

87
02:09:31,0 --> 02:09:31,0
11 In me he

88
02:09:31,0 --> 02:09:31,0
shall have glory,

89
02:09:31,0 --> 02:09:31,0
and not of

90
02:09:31,0 --> 02:09:31,0
himself, whether in

91
02:09:31,0 --> 02:09:31,0
weakness or in

92
02:09:31,0 --> 02:09:31,0
strength,

93
02:09:31,0 --> 02:17:01,
whether in bonds or free;

94
02:17:01,0 --> 02:17:01,0
12 And at all

95
02:17:01,0 --> 02:17:01,0
times, and in

96
02:17:01,0 --> 02:17:01,0
all places, he

97
02:17:01,0 --> 02:17:01,0
shall open

98
02:17:01,0 --> 02:17:01,0
his mouth and

99
02:17:01,0 --> 02:17:01,0
declare my

100
02:17:01,0 --> 02:17:01,0
gospel as with the

101
02:17:01,0 --> 02:17:01,0
voice of a

102
02:17:01,0 --> 02:17:01,0
trump, both day

103
02:17:01,0 --> 02:17:01,0
and night. And

104
02:17:01,0 --> 02:17:01,0
I will give

105
02:17:01,0 --> 02:17:01,0
unto him

106
02:17:01,0 --> 02:17:01,0
strength such as is

107
02:17:01,0 --> 02:33:55,
not known among men.

108
02:33:55,0 --> 02:33:55,0
13 Require

109
02:33:55,0 --> 02:33:55,0
not miracles,

110
02:33:55,0 --> 02:33:55,0
except I shall

111
02:33:55,0 --> 02:33:55,0
command you,

112
02:33:55,0 --> 02:33:55,0
except

113
02:33:55,0 --> 02:33:55,0
casting out

114
02:33:55,0 --> 02:33:55,0
devils, healing the

115
02:33:55,0 --> 02:33:55,0
sick, and

116
02:33:55,0 --> 02:33:55,0
against

117
02:33:55,0 --> 02:33:55,0
poisonous serpents,

118
02:33:55,0 --> 02:33:55,0
and against

119
02:33:55,0 --> 02:45:02,
deadly poisons;

120
02:45:02,0 --> 02:45:02,0
14 And these

121
02:45:02,0 --> 02:45:02,0
things ye

122
02:45:02,0 --> 02:45:02,0
shall not do,

123
02:45:02,0 --> 02:45:02,0
except it

124
02:45:02,0 --> 02:45:02,0
be required

125
02:45:02,0 --> 02:45:02,0
of you by

126
02:45:02,0 --> 02:45:02,0
them who desire

127
02:45:02,0 --> 02:45:02,0
it, that

128
02:45:02,0 --> 02:45:02,0
the scriptures

129
02:45:02,0 --> 02:45:02,0
might be

130
02:45:02,0 --> 02:45:02,0
fulfilled; for

131
02:45:02,0 --> 02:45:02,0
ye shall do

132
02:45:02,0 --> 02:45:02,0
according

133
02:45:02,0 --> 02:47:44,
to that which is written.

134
02:47:44,0 --> 02:47:44,0
15 And in

135
02:47:44,0 --> 02:47:44,0
whatsoever

136
02:47:44,0 --> 02:47:44,0
place ye

137
02:47:44,0 --> 02:47:44,0
shall enter,

138
02:47:44,0 --> 02:47:44,0
and they

139
02:47:44,0 --> 02:47:44,0
receive you

140
02:47:44,0 --> 02:47:44,0
not in my

141
02:47:44,0 --> 02:47:44,0
name, ye shall

142
02:47:44,0 --> 02:47:44,0
leave a

143
02:47:44,0 --> 02:47:44,0
cursing

144
02:47:44,0 --> 02:47:44,0
instead of a

145
02:47:44,0 --> 02:47:44,0
blessing, by

146
02:47:44,0 --> 02:47:44,0
casting off

147
02:47:44,0 --> 02:47:44,0
the dust of

148
02:47:44,0 --> 02:47:44,0
your feet

149
02:47:44,0 --> 02:47:44,0
against

150
02:47:44,0 --> 02:47:44,0
them as a

151
02:47:44,0 --> 02:47:44,0
testimony, and

152
02:47:44,0 --> 02:47:44,0
cleansing

153
02:47:44,0 --> 02:47:16,
your feet by the wayside.

154
02:47:16,0 --> 02:47:16,0
16 And it

155
02:47:16,0 --> 02:47:16,0
shall come

156
02:47:16,0 --> 02:47:16,0
to pass

157
02:47:16,0 --> 02:47:16,0
that

158
02:47:16,0 --> 02:47:16,0
whosoever shall

159
02:47:16,0 --> 02:47:16,0
lay their

160
02:47:16,0 --> 02:47:16,0
hands upon

161
02:47:16,0 --> 02:47:16,0
you by

162
02:47:16,0 --> 02:47:16,0
violence, ye

163
02:47:16,0 --> 02:47:16,0
shall

164
02:47:16,0 --> 02:47:16,0
command to be

165
02:47:16,0 --> 02:47:16,0
smitten

166
02:47:16,0 --> 02:47:16,0
in my name;

167
02:47:16,0 --> 02:47:16,0
and,

168
02:47:16,0 --> 02:47:16,0
behold, I will

169
02:47:16,0 --> 02:47:16,0
smite

170
02:47:16,0 --> 02:47:16,0
them

171
02:47:16,0 --> 02:47:16,0
according to your

172
02:47:16,0 --> 02:48:28,
words, in mine own due time.

173
02:48:28,0 --> 02:48:28,0
17 And

174
02:48:28,0 --> 02:48:28,0
whosoever

175
02:48:28,0 --> 02:48:28,0
shall go to

176
02:48:28,0 --> 02:48:28,0
law with

177
02:48:28,0 --> 02:48:28,0
thee shall

178
02:48:28,0 --> 02:48:28,0
be cursed

179
02:48:28,0 --> 02:54:39,
by the law.

180
02:54:39,0 --> 02:54:39,0
18 And

181
02:54:39,0 --> 02:54:39,0
thou shalt

182
02:54:39,0 --> 02:54:39,0
take no

183
02:54:39,0 --> 02:54:39,0
purse nor

184
02:54:39,0 --> 02:54:39,0
scrip,

185
02:54:39,0 --> 02:54:39,0
neither

186
02:54:39,0 --> 02:54:39,0
staves,

187
02:54:39,0 --> 02:54:39,0
neither two

188
02:54:39,0 --> 02:54:39,0
coats, for

189
02:54:39,0 --> 02:54:39,0
the

190
02:54:39,0 --> 02:54:39,0
church shall

191
02:54:39,0 --> 02:54:39,0
give unto

192
02:54:39,0 --> 02:54:39,0
thee in

193
02:54:39,0 --> 02:54:39,0
the very

194
02:54:39,0 --> 02:54:39,0
hour what

195
02:54:39,0 --> 02:54:39,0
thou

196
02:54:39,0 --> 02:54:39,0
needest for

197
02:54:39,0 --> 02:54:39,0
food and

198
02:54:39,0 --> 02:54:39,0
for

199
02:54:39,0 --> 02:54:39,0
raiment, and

200
02:54:39,0 --> 02:54:39,0
for shoes

201
02:54:39,0 --> 02:59:50,
and for money, and for scrip.

202
02:59:50,0 --> 02:59:50,0
19 For

203
02:59:50,0 --> 02:59:50,0
thou art

204
02:59:50,0 --> 02:59:50,0
called

205
02:59:50,0 --> 02:59:50,0
to prune

206
02:59:50,0 --> 02:59:50,0
my

207
02:59:50,0 --> 02:59:50,0
vineyard with

208
02:59:50,0 --> 02:59:50,0
a

209
02:59:50,0 --> 02:59:50,0
mighty

210
02:59:50,0 --> 02:59:50,0
pruning, yea,

211
02:59:50,0 --> 02:59:50,0
even for

212
02:59:50,0 --> 02:59:50,0
the

213
02:59:50,0 --> 02:59:50,0
last time;

214
02:59:50,0 --> 02:59:50,0
yea, and

215
02:59:50,0 --> 02:59:50,0
also

216
02:59:50,0 --> 02:59:50,0
all those

217
02:59:50,0 --> 02:59:50,0
whom

218
02:59:50,0 --> 02:59:50,0
thou hast

219
02:59:50,0 --> 02:59:50,0
ordained,

220
02:59:50,0 --> 02:59:50,0
and

221
02:59:50,0 --> 02:59:50,0
they shall

222
02:59:50,0 --> 02:59:50,0
do even

223
02:59:50,0 --> 02:59:50,0


224
02:59:50,0 --> 03:03:49,
according to this pattern. Amen.
