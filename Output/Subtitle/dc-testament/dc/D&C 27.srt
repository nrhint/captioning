4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
which the sacrament of bread and wine was to be

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
administered, Joseph set out to procure wine. He

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
was met by a heavenly messenger and received

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
this revelation, a portion of which was written

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
at the time and the remainder in the September

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0

the sacramental services of the Church. 
1–4,

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
The emblems to be used in partaking of the

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
sacrament are set forth; 
5–14, Christ and His

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
servants from all dispensations are to partake of

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:49:00,
the sacrament; 
15–18, Put on the whole armor of God. 

15
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
1 Listen to the voice of Jesus

16
00:49:00,0 --> 00:49:00,0
Christ, your Lord, your God, and your

17
00:49:00,0 --> 00:48:32,
Redeemer, whose word is quick and powerful.

18
00:48:32,0 --> 00:48:32,0
2 For, behold, I say unto you,

19
00:48:32,0 --> 00:48:32,0
that it mattereth not what ye shall

20
00:48:32,0 --> 00:48:32,0
eat or what ye shall drink when ye

21
00:48:32,0 --> 00:48:32,0
partake of the sacrament, if it so

22
00:48:32,0 --> 00:48:32,0
be that ye do it with an eye

23
00:48:32,0 --> 00:48:32,0
single to my glory—remembering unto

24
00:48:32,0 --> 00:48:32,0
the Father my body which was laid

25
00:48:32,0 --> 00:48:32,0
down for you, and my blood which was

26
00:48:32,0 --> 00:48:04,
shed for the remission of your sins.

27
00:48:04,0 --> 00:48:04,0
3 Wherefore, a commandment I

28
00:48:04,0 --> 00:48:04,0
give unto you, that you

29
00:48:04,0 --> 00:48:04,0
shall not purchase wine neither

30
00:48:04,0 --> 00:49:16,
strong drink of your enemies;

31
00:49:16,0 --> 00:49:16,0
4 Wherefore, you shall

32
00:49:16,0 --> 00:49:16,0
partake of none except

33
00:49:16,0 --> 00:49:16,0
it is made new among

34
00:49:16,0 --> 00:49:16,0
you; yea, in this my

35
00:49:16,0 --> 00:49:16,0
Father’s kingdom which

36
00:49:16,0 --> 00:48:48,
shall be built up on the earth.

37
00:48:48,0 --> 00:48:48,0
5 Behold, this is

38
00:48:48,0 --> 00:48:48,0
wisdom in me; wherefore,

39
00:48:48,0 --> 00:48:48,0
marvel not, for the

40
00:48:48,0 --> 00:48:48,0
hour cometh that I will

41
00:48:48,0 --> 00:48:48,0
drink of the fruit of

42
00:48:48,0 --> 00:48:48,0
the vine with you on

43
00:48:48,0 --> 00:48:48,0
the earth, and with

44
00:48:48,0 --> 00:48:48,0
Moroni, whom I have sent

45
00:48:48,0 --> 00:48:48,0
unto you to reveal the

46
00:48:48,0 --> 00:48:48,0
Book of Mormon,

47
00:48:48,0 --> 00:48:48,0
containing the fulness of my

48
00:48:48,0 --> 00:48:48,0
everlasting gospel,

49
00:48:48,0 --> 00:48:48,0
to whom I have

50
00:48:48,0 --> 00:48:48,0
committed the keys of the

51
00:48:48,0 --> 00:48:20,
record of the stick of Ephraim;

52
00:48:20,0 --> 00:48:20,0
6 And also with

53
00:48:20,0 --> 00:48:20,0
Elias, to whom I have

54
00:48:20,0 --> 00:48:20,0
committed the keys of

55
00:48:20,0 --> 00:48:20,0
bringing to pass the

56
00:48:20,0 --> 00:48:20,0
restoration of all

57
00:48:20,0 --> 00:48:20,0
things spoken by the

58
00:48:20,0 --> 00:48:20,0
mouth of all the

59
00:48:20,0 --> 00:48:20,0
holy prophets since

60
00:48:20,0 --> 00:48:20,0
the world began,

61
00:48:20,0 --> 00:49:32,
concerning the last days;

62
00:49:32,0 --> 00:49:32,0
7 And also John the

63
00:49:32,0 --> 00:49:32,0
son of Zacharias,

64
00:49:32,0 --> 00:49:32,0
which Zacharias he

65
00:49:32,0 --> 00:49:32,0
(Elias) visited and

66
00:49:32,0 --> 00:49:32,0
gave promise that

67
00:49:32,0 --> 00:49:32,0
he should have a

68
00:49:32,0 --> 00:49:32,0
son, and his name

69
00:49:32,0 --> 00:49:32,0
should be John, and he

70
00:49:32,0 --> 00:49:32,0
should be filled

71
00:49:32,0 --> 00:57:02,
with the spirit of Elias;

72
00:57:02,0 --> 00:57:02,0
8 Which John I

73
00:57:02,0 --> 00:57:02,0
have sent unto you,

74
00:57:02,0 --> 00:57:02,0
my servants, Joseph

00:57:02,0 --> 00:57:02,0
priesthood which you have

80
00:57:02,0 --> 00:57:02,0
received, that you

81
00:57:02,0 --> 00:57:02,0
might be called

82
00:57:02,0 --> 01:12:30,
and ordained even as Aaron;

83
01:12:30,0 --> 01:12:30,0
9 And also

84
01:12:30,0 --> 01:12:30,0

85
01:12:30,0 --> 01:12:30,0
have committed the

86
01:12:30,0 --> 01:12:30,0
keys of the power

87
01:12:30,0 --> 01:12:30,0
of turning the

88
01:12:30,0 --> 01:12:30,0
hearts of the

01:12:30,0 --> 01:12:30,0
of the children

92
01:12:30,0 --> 01:12:30,0
to the fathers,

93
01:12:30,0 --> 01:12:30,0
that the whole

94
01:12:30,0 --> 01:12:30,0
earth may not be

95
01:12:30,0 --> 01:17:41,
smitten with a curse;

96
01:17:41,0 --> 01:17:41,0
10 And also with

of all, the

106
01:25:53,0 --> 01:25:53,0
prince of all,

107
01:25:53,0 --> 01:48:58,

especial

119
01:48:58,0 --> 01:48:58,0
witnesses of my name,

124
01:48:58,0 --> 02:02:07,
things which I revealed unto them;

125
02:02:07,0 --> 02:02:07,0
13 Unto whom

126
02:02:07,0 --> 02:02:07,0

131
02:02:07,0 --> 02:02:07,0
the gospel for

132
02:02:07,0 --> 02:02:07,0
the last

133
02:02:07,0 --> 02:02:07,0
times; and for

134
02:02:07,0 --> 02:02:07,0
the fulness of

135
02:02:07,0 --> 02:02:07,0
times, in the

136
02:02:07,0 --> 02:02:07,0
which I will

137
02:02:07,0 --> 02:02:07,0
gather

138
02:02:07,0 --> 02:02:07,0
together in one

139
02:02:07,0 --> 02:02:07,0
all things,

140
02:02:07,0 --> 02:02:07,0
both which are

141
02:02:07,0 --> 02:02:07,0
in heaven, and

142
02:02:07,0 --> 02:09:15,
which are on earth;

143
02:09:15,0 --> 02:09:15,0
14 And also

144
02:09:15,0 --> 02:09:15,0
with all

145
02:09:15,0 --> 02:09:15,0
those whom my

146
02:09:15,0 --> 02:09:15,0
Father hath

147
02:09:15,0 --> 02:09:15,0
given me out

148
02:09:15,0 --> 02:15:26,
of the world.

149
02:15:26,0 --> 02:15:26,0
15

150
02:15:26,0 --> 02:15:26,0
Wherefore, lift up

151
02:15:26,0 --> 02:15:26,0
your hearts

152
02:15:26,0 --> 02:15:26,0

02:15:26,0 --> 02:15:26,0
rejoice, and gird

154
02:15:26,0 --> 02:15:26,0
up your

02:15:26,0 --> 02:15:26,0
take upon you

157
02:15:26,0 --> 02:15:26,0
my whole

158
02:15:26,0 --> 02:15:26,0
armor, that

159
02:15:26,0 --> 02:15:26,0
ye may be

160
02:15:26,0 --> 02:15:26,0
able to

161
02:15:26,0 --> 02:15:26,0
withstand the

162
02:15:26,0 --> 02:15:26,0
evil day,

163
02:15:26,0 --> 02:15:26,0
having done

164
02:15:26,0 --> 02:15:26,0
all, that ye

165
02:15:26,0 --> 02:27:37,
may be able to stand.

166
02:27:37,0 --> 02:27:37,0
16 Stand,

167
02:27:37,0 --> 02:27:37,0
therefore,

175
02:27:37,0 --> 02:27:37,0


176
02:27:37,0 --> 02:27:37,0
righteousness, and

177
02:27:37,0 --> 02:27:37,0
your feet

178
02:27:37,0 --> 02:27:37,0
shod with

179
02:27:37,0 --> 02:27:37,0
the

180
02:27:37,0 --> 02:27:37,0
preparation of

181
02:27:37,0 --> 02:27:37,0
the gospel

182
02:27:37,0 --> 02:27:37,0
of peace,

183
02:27:37,0 --> 02:27:37,0
which I

184
02:27:37,0 --> 02:27:37,0
have sent

185
02:27:37,0 --> 02:43:47,
mine angels to commit unto you;

186
02:43:47,0 --> 02:43:47,0
17 Taking

187
02:43:47,0 --> 02:43:47,0

shield of

189
02:43:47,0 --> 02:43:47,0
faith

190
02:43:47,0 --> 02:43:47,0
wherewith ye

191
02:43:47,0 --> 02:43:47,0
shall be

192
02:43:47,0 --> 02:43:47,0
able to

193
02:43:47,0 --> 02:43:47,0
quench all

194
02:43:47,0 --> 02:43:47,0
the fiery

195
02:43:47,0 --> 02:43:47,0
darts of

196
02:43:47,0 --> 02:51:16,
the wicked;

197
02:51:16,0 --> 02:51:16,0
18 And

198
02:51:16,0 --> 02:51:16,0
take the

199
02:51:16,0 --> 02:51:16,0

02:51:16,0 --> 02:51:16,0
salvation, and

202
02:51:16,0 --> 02:51:16,0
the

203
02:51:16,0 --> 02:51:16,0
sword of my

204
02:51:16,0 --> 02:51:16,0
Spirit,

205
02:51:16,0 --> 02:51:16,0
which I

206
02:51:16,0 --> 02:51:16,0
will

207
02:51:16,0 --> 02:51:16,0
pour out

208
02:51:16,0 --> 02:51:16,0
upon you,

209
02:51:16,0 --> 02:51:16,0
and my

02:51:16,0 --> 02:51:16,0
word

211
02:51:16,0 --> 02:51:16,0
which I

213
02:51:16,0 --> 02:51:16,0
you,

214
02:51:16,0 --> 02:51:16,0
and be

221
02:51:16,0 --> 02:51:16,0
me, and

222
02:51:16,0 --> 02:51:16,0
be

223
02:51:16,0 --> 02:51:16,0
faithful

224
02:51:16,0 --> 02:51:16,0
until I

225
02:51:16,0 --> 02:51:16,0
come, and ye

226
02:51:16,0 --> 02:51:16,0
shall

227
02:51:16,0 --> 02:51:16,0
be caught

228
02:51:16,0 --> 02:51:16,0
up,

229
02:51:16,0 --> 02:53:28,
that where I am ye shall be also. Amen.
