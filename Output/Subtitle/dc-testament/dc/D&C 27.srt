00:00:07,0 --> 00:00:14,0
Prophet, at Harmony, Pennsylvania, August

3

1830. In preparation for a religious service at

4
00:00:21,0 --> 00:00:28,0
which the sacrament of bread and wine was to be

5
00:00:28,0 --> 00:00:35,0
administered, Joseph set out to procure wine. He

6
00:00:35,0 --> 00:00:42,0
was met by a heavenly messenger and received

7
00:00:42,0 --> 00:00:49,0
this revelation, a portion of which was written

8
00:00:49,0 --> 00:00:56,0
at the time and the remainder in the September

9
00:00:56,0 --> 00:01:03,0
following. Water is now used instead of wine in

10
00:01:03,0 --> 00:01:10,0
the sacramental services of the Church. 
1–4,

11
00:01:10,0 --> 00:01:17,0
The emblems to be used in partaking of the

12
00:01:17,0 --> 00:01:24,0
sacrament are set forth; 
5–14, Christ and His

13
00:01:24,0 --> 00:01:31,0
servants from all dispensations are to partake of

14
00:01:31,0 --> 00:01:38,098
the sacrament; 
15–18, Put on the whole armor of God. 

15
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:41,431
1 Listen to the voice of Jesus

16
00:01:41,431 --> 00:01:44,764
Christ, your Lord, your God, and your

17
00:01:44,764 --> 00:01:48,442
Redeemer, whose word is quick and powerful.

18
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:48,998
2 For, behold, I say unto you,

19
00:01:48,998 --> 00:01:49,554
that it mattereth not what ye shall

20
00:01:49,554 --> 00:01:50,11
eat or what ye shall drink when ye

21
00:01:50,11 --> 00:01:50,666
partake of the sacrament, if it so

22
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:51,222
be that ye do it with an eye

23
00:01:51,222 --> 00:01:51,778
single to my glory—remembering unto

24
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:52,334
the Father my body which was laid

25
00:01:52,334 --> 00:01:52,89
down for you, and my blood which was

26
00:01:52,89 --> 00:01:53,847
shed for the remission of your sins.

27
00:01:53,847 --> 00:02:01,597
3 Wherefore, a commandment I

28
00:02:01,597 --> 00:02:09,347
give unto you, that you

29
00:02:09,347 --> 00:02:17,097
shall not purchase wine neither

30
00:02:17,097 --> 00:02:24,811
strong drink of your enemies;

31
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,644
4 Wherefore, you shall

32
00:02:26,644 --> 00:02:28,477
partake of none except

33
00:02:28,477 --> 00:02:30,31
it is made new among

34
00:02:30,31 --> 00:02:32,143
you; yea, in this my

35
00:02:32,143 --> 00:02:33,976
Father’s kingdom which

36
00:02:33,976 --> 00:02:35,188
shall be built up on the earth.

37
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:36,321
5 Behold, this is

38
00:02:36,321 --> 00:02:37,454
wisdom in me; wherefore,

39
00:02:37,454 --> 00:02:38,587
marvel not, for the

40
00:02:38,587 --> 00:02:39,72
hour cometh that I will

41
00:02:39,72 --> 00:02:40,853
drink of the fruit of

42
00:02:40,853 --> 00:02:41,986
the vine with you on

43
00:02:41,986 --> 00:02:43,119
the earth, and with

44
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:44,252
Moroni, whom I have sent

45
00:02:44,252 --> 00:02:45,385
unto you to reveal the

46
00:02:45,385 --> 00:02:46,518
Book of Mormon,

47
00:02:46,518 --> 00:02:47,651
containing the fulness of my

48
00:02:47,651 --> 00:02:48,784
everlasting gospel,

49
00:02:48,784 --> 00:02:49,917
to whom I have

50
00:02:49,917 --> 00:02:51,05
committed the keys of the

51
00:02:51,05 --> 00:02:52,606
record of the stick of Ephraim;

52
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:57,106
6 And also with

53
00:02:57,106 --> 00:03:01,606
Elias, to whom I have

54
00:03:01,606 --> 00:03:06,106
committed the keys of

55
00:03:06,106 --> 00:03:10,606
bringing to pass the

56
00:03:10,606 --> 00:03:15,106
restoration of all

57
00:03:15,106 --> 00:03:19,606
things spoken by the

58
00:03:19,606 --> 00:03:24,106
mouth of all the

59
00:03:24,106 --> 00:03:28,606
holy prophets since

60
00:03:28,606 --> 00:03:33,106
the world began,

61
00:03:33,106 --> 00:03:37,884
concerning the last days;

62
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,584
7 And also John the

63
00:03:40,584 --> 00:03:43,284
son of Zacharias,

64
00:03:43,284 --> 00:03:45,984
which Zacharias he

65
00:03:45,984 --> 00:03:48,684
(Elias) visited and

66
00:03:48,684 --> 00:03:51,384
gave promise that

67
00:03:51,384 --> 00:03:54,084
he should have a

68
00:03:54,084 --> 00:03:56,784
son, and his name

69
00:03:56,784 --> 00:03:59,484
should be John, and he

70
00:03:59,484 --> 00:04:02,184
should be filled

71
00:04:02,184 --> 00:04:04,211
with the spirit of Elias;

72
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:05,12
8 Which John I

73
00:04:05,12 --> 00:04:06,029
have sent unto you,

74
00:04:06,029 --> 00:04:06,938
my servants, Joseph

75
00:04:06,938 --> 00:04:07,847

ordain you unto

78
00:04:09,665 --> 00:04:10,574

79
00:04:10,574 --> 00:04:11,483
priesthood which you have

80
00:04:11,483 --> 00:04:12,392
received, that you

81
00:04:12,392 --> 00:04:13,301
might be called

82
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:14,554
and ordained even as Aaron;

83
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:15,631
9 And also

84
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:16,708

86
00:04:17,785 --> 00:04:18,862
keys of the power

87
00:04:18,862 --> 00:04:19,939
of turning the

88
00:04:19,939 --> 00:04:21,016
hearts of the

89
00:04:21,016 --> 00:04:22,093
fathers to the

90
00:04:22,093 --> 00:04:23,17
children, and the hearts

91
00:04:23,17 --> 00:04:24,247
of the children

92
00:04:24,247 --> 00:04:25,324
to the fathers,

93
00:04:25,324 --> 00:04:26,401
that the whole

94
00:04:26,401 --> 00:04:27,478
earth may not be

95
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:28,835
smitten with a curse;

96
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:29,335
10 And also with

fathers, by whom

101
00:04:31,335 --> 00:04:31,238
the promises remain;

102
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:35,238
11 And also

103
00:04:35,238 --> 00:04:39,238

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,921
you, by whom I

00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,567
confirmed you to be

117
00:05:12,567 --> 00:05:14,449

ministry and of

123
00:05:23,859 --> 00:05:25,741
the same

124
00:05:25,741 --> 00:05:27,994
things which I revealed unto them;

125
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,216
13 Unto whom

126
00:05:29,216 --> 00:05:30,438
I have

127
00:05:30,438 --> 00:05:31,66
committed the keys

128
00:05:31,66 --> 00:05:32,882
of my

129
00:05:32,882 --> 00:05:34,104
kingdom, and a

130
00:05:34,104 --> 00:05:35,326
dispensation of

131
00:05:35,326 --> 00:05:36,548
the gospel for

132
00:05:36,548 --> 00:05:37,77
the last

133
00:05:37,77 --> 00:05:38,992
times; and for

134
00:05:38,992 --> 00:05:40,214
the fulness of

135
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:41,436
times, in the

136
00:05:41,436 --> 00:05:42,658
which I will

137
00:05:42,658 --> 00:05:43,88
gather

138
00:05:43,88 --> 00:05:45,102
together in one

139
00:05:45,102 --> 00:05:46,324
all things,

140
00:05:46,324 --> 00:05:47,546
both which are

141
00:05:47,546 --> 00:05:48,768

00:05:48,768 --> 00:05:49,349
which are on earth;

143
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:53,182
14 And also

144
00:05:53,182 --> 00:05:57,015
with all

145
00:05:57,015 --> 00:06:00,848
those whom my

146
00:06:00,848 --> 00:06:04,681
Father hath

147
00:06:04,681 --> 00:06:08,514
given me out

148
00:06:08,514 --> 00:06:12,339
of the world.

149
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:14,339
15

150
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:16,339
Wherefore, lift up

151
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:18,339
your hearts

152
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:20,339
and

153
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:22,339
rejoice, and gird

154
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:24,339

00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:28,339
take upon you

157
00:06:28,339 --> 00:06:30,339
my whole

158
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:32,339
armor, that

159
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:34,339
ye may be

160
00:06:34,339 --> 00:06:36,339
able to

161
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:38,339
withstand the

162
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:40,339
evil day,

163
00:06:40,339 --> 00:06:42,339
having done

164
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:44,339
all, that ye

165
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:46,64
may be able to stand.

166
00:06:46,64 --> 00:06:46,59
16 Stand,

167
00:06:46,59 --> 00:06:46,54
therefore,

168
00:06:46,54 --> 00:06:46,49
having

169
00:06:46,49 --> 00:06:46,44

girt about

171
00:06:46,39 --> 00:06:46,34
with

00:06:46,19 --> 00:06:46,14


176
00:06:46,14 --> 00:06:46,09
righteousness, and

177
00:06:46,09 --> 00:06:46,04
your feet

178
00:06:46,04 --> 00:06:45,99
shod with

179
00:06:45,99 --> 00:06:45,94
the

180
00:06:45,94 --> 00:06:45,89
preparation of

181
00:06:45,89 --> 00:06:45,84
the gospel

182
00:06:45,84 --> 00:06:45,79
of peace,

183
00:06:45,79 --> 00:06:45,74
which I

184
00:06:45,74 --> 00:06:45,69
have sent

185
00:06:45,69 --> 00:06:45,705
mine angels to commit unto you;

186
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:45,614
17 Taking

187
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:45,523

00:06:45,523 --> 00:06:45,432
shield of

189
00:06:45,432 --> 00:06:45,341
faith

190
00:06:45,341 --> 00:06:45,25
wherewith ye

191
00:06:45,25 --> 00:06:45,159
shall be

192
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:45,068
able to

193
00:06:45,068 --> 00:06:44,977
quench all

194
00:06:44,977 --> 00:06:44,886
the fiery

195
00:06:44,886 --> 00:06:44,795
darts of

196
00:06:44,795 --> 00:06:44,771
the wicked;

197
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:44,892
18 And

198
00:06:44,892 --> 00:06:45,013
take the

199
00:06:45,013 --> 00:06:45,134
helmet

200
00:06:45,134 --> 00:06:45,255

201
00:06:45,255 --> 00:06:45,376
salvation, and

203
00:06:45,497 --> 00:06:45,618
sword of my

204
00:06:45,618 --> 00:06:45,739
Spirit,

205
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:45,86
which I

206
00:06:45,86 --> 00:06:45,981
will

207
00:06:45,981 --> 00:06:46,102
pour out

208
00:06:46,102 --> 00:06:46,223
upon you,

209
00:06:46,223 --> 00:06:46,344
and my

210
00:06:46,344 --> 00:06:46,465
word

211
00:06:46,465 --> 00:06:46,586
which I

212
00:06:46,586 --> 00:06:46,707
reveal unto

213
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:46,828
you,

214
00:06:46,828 --> 00:06:46,949
and be

215
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:47,07
agreed as

216
00:06:47,07 --> 00:06:47,191
touching

217
00:06:47,191 --> 00:06:47,312
all

218
00:06:47,312 --> 00:06:47,433
things

219
00:06:47,433 --> 00:06:47,554
whatsoever ye

220
00:06:47,554 --> 00:06:47,675
ask of

221
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:47,796
me, and

222
00:06:47,796 --> 00:06:47,917
be

223
00:06:47,917 --> 00:06:48,038
faithful

224
00:06:48,038 --> 00:06:48,159
until I

225
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:48,28
come, and ye

226
00:06:48,28 --> 00:06:48,401
shall

227
00:06:48,401 --> 00:06:48,522
be caught

228
00:06:48,522 --> 00:06:48,643
up,

229
00:06:48,643 --> 00:06:48,241
that where I am ye shall be also. Amen.
