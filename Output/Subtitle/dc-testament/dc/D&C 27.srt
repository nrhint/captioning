 preparation for a religious service at which the

00:00:30,349 --> 00:00:36,706
 sacrament of bread and wine was to be administered,

5
00:00:36,706 --> 00:00:43,063
 Joseph set out to procure wine. He was met by a

6
00:00:43,063 --> 00:00:49,42
 heavenly messenger and received this revelation, a

7
00:00:49,42 --> 00:00:55,777

15
00:01:40,5 --> 00:01:45,167
1 Listen to the voice of Jesus Christ, your Lord,

16
00:01:45,167 --> 00:01:49,834
 your God, and your Redeemer, whose word is quick

17
00:01:49,834 --> 00:01:54,501
 and powerful

18
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:59,21
2 For, behold, I say unto you, that it mattereth

19
00:01:59,21 --> 00:02:03,639
 not what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink when

20
00:02:03,639 --> 00:02:08,068
 ye partake of the sacrament, if it so be that ye do

21
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:12,497
 it with an eye single to my glory—remembering

22
00:02:12,497 --> 00:02:16,926
 unto the Father my body which was laid down for you,

23
00:02:16,926 --> 00:02:21,355
 and my blood which was shed for the remission of

24
00:02:21,355 --> 00:02:25,784
 your sins

25
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:28,679
3 Wherefore, a commandment I give unto you, that

26
00:02:28,679 --> 00:02:32,346
 you shall not purchase wine neither strong drink of

27
00:02:32,346 --> 00:02:36,013
 your enemies

28
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:42,19
4 Wherefore, you shall partake of none except it

29
00:02:42,19 --> 00:02:47,857
 is made new among you; yea, in this my Father’s

30
00:02:47,857 --> 00:02:53,524
 kingdom which shall be built up on the earth

31
00:02:53,073 --> 00:02:59,502
5 Behold, this is wisdom in me; wherefore, marvel

32
00:02:59,502 --> 00:03:05,931
 not, for the hour cometh that I will drink of the

33
00:03:05,931 --> 00:03:12,36
 fruit of the vine with you on the earth, and with

34
00:03:12,36 --> 00:03:18,789
 Moroni, whom I have sent unto you to reveal the

35
00:03:18,789 --> 00:03:25,218
 Book of Mormon, containing the fulness of my

36
00:03:25,218 --> 00:03:31,647
 everlasting gospel, to whom I have committed the keys of

37
00:03:31,647 --> 00:03:38,076

38

6 And also with Elias, to whom I have committed

39
00:03:43,918 --> 00:03:49,119

40
00:03:49,119 --> 00:03:54,319
 things spoken by the mouth of all the holy

41
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:59,519
 prophets since the world began, concerning the last days

42
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,719

45
00:04:18,978 --> 00:04:25,978
 should have a son, and his name should be John, and

46
00:04:25,978 --> 00:04:32,978
 he should be filled with the spirit of Elias

47
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:37,472
8 Which John I have sent unto you, my servants,

48
00:04:37,472 --> 00:04:42,272
 Joseph Smith, Jun., and Oliver Cowdery, to ordain

49
00:04:42,272 --> 00:04:47,072
 you unto the first priesthood which you have

50
00:04:47,072 --> 00:04:51,872
 received, that you might be called and ordained even as

51
00:04:51,872 --> 00:04:56,672
 Aaron

52
00:04:56,129 --> 00:05:02,529
9 And also Elijah, unto whom I have committed the

53
00:05:02,529 --> 00:05:08,929
 keys of the power of turning the hearts of the

54
00:05:08,929 --> 00:05:15,329
 fathers to the children, and the hearts of the

55
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:21,729
 children to the fathers, that the whole earth may not be

56
00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:28,129
 smitten with a curse

57
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:36,195

 remain

60
00:05:50,116 --> 00:06:01,116
11 And also with Michael, or Adam, the father of

61
00:06:01,116 --> 00:06:12,116
 all, the prince of all, the ancient of days

62
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:19,172
12 And also with Peter, and James, and John, whom

63
00:06:19,172 --> 00:06:25,505

00:06:38,171 --> 00:06:44,504
 ministry and of the same things which I revealed unto

67
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:50,837
 them

68
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:57,043
13 Unto whom I have committed the keys of my

69
00:06:57,043 --> 00:07:04,043
 kingdom, and a dispensation of the gospel for the last

70
00:07:04,043 --> 00:07:11,043
 times; and for the fulness of times, in the which

71
00:07:11,043 --> 00:07:18,043
 I will gather together in one all things, both

72
00:07:18,043 --> 00:07:25,043
 which are in heaven, and which are on earth

73
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:32,478
14 And also with all those whom my Father hath

74
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:39,478
 given me out of the world

75
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:48,759
15 Wherefore, lift up your hearts and rejoice, and

76
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:57,759
 gird up your loins, and take upon you my whole

77
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:06,759
 armor, that ye may be able to withstand the evil

78
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:15,759
 day, having done all, that ye may be able to stand

79
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:21,428
16 Stand, therefore, having your loins girt about

80
00:08:21,428 --> 00:08:27,428
 with truth, having on the breastplate of

81
00:08:27,428 --> 00:08:33,428
 righteousness, and your feet shod with the preparation of

82
00:08:33,428 --> 00:08:39,428
 the gospel of peace, which I have sent mine angels

83
00:08:39,428 --> 00:08:45,428
 to commit unto you

84
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:50,792
17 Taking the shield of faith wherewith ye shall

85
00:08:50,792 --> 00:08:56,459
 be able to quench all the fiery darts of the

86
00:08:56,459 --> 00:09:02,126
 wicked

87
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:08,475
18 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword

88
00:09:08,475 --> 00:09:14,808
 of my Spirit, which I will pour out upon you, and

89
00:09:14,808 --> 00:09:21,141
 my word which I reveal unto you, and be agreed as

90
00:09:21,141 --> 00:09:27,474
 touching all things whatsoever ye ask of me, and

91
00:09:27,474 --> 00:09:33,807
 be faithful until I come, and ye shall be caught

92
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:40,14
 up, that where I am ye shall be also. Amen.
