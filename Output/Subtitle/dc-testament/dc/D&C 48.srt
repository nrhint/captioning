00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:16,816
Section 48 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:22,354
 the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, March 10, 1831. The

3
00:00:22,354 --> 00:00:27,892
 Prophet had inquired of the Lord as to the mode

4
00:00:27,892 --> 00:00:33,43
 of procedure in procuring lands for the settlement

5
00:00:33,43 --> 00:00:38,968
 of the Saints. This was an important matter in

6
00:00:38,968 --> 00:00:44,506
 view of the migration of members of the Church from

7
00:00:44,506 --> 00:00:50,044
 the eastern United States, in obedience to the

8
00:00:50,044 --> 00:00:55,582
 Lord’s command that they should assemble in Ohio (see

9
00:00:55,582 --> 00:01:01,12
sections 37:1–3; 
45:64). 
1–3, The Saints in

10
00:01:01,12 --> 00:01:06,658
 Ohio are to share their lands with their brethren;

11
00:01:06,658 --> 00:01:12,196
4–6, The Saints are to purchase lands, build a

12
00:01:12,196 --> 00:01:17,734
 city, and follow the counsel of their presiding

13
00:01:17,734 --> 00:01:23,272
 officers.

14
00:01:23,433 --> 00:01:27,1
1 It is necessary that ye should remain for the

15
00:01:27,1 --> 00:01:30,767
 present time in your places of abode, as it shall be

16
00:01:30,767 --> 00:01:34,434
 suitable to your circumstances

17
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:39,511
2 And inasmuch as ye have lands, ye shall impart

18
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:45,011
 to the eastern brethren

19
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:49,772
3 And inasmuch as ye have not lands, let them buy

20
00:01:49,772 --> 00:01:53,772
 for the present time in those regions round about,

21
00:01:53,772 --> 00:01:57,772
 as seemeth them good, for it must needs be

22
00:01:57,772 --> 00:02:01,772
 necessary that they have places to live for the present

23
00:02:01,772 --> 00:02:05,772
 time

24
00:02:05,275 --> 00:02:08,875
4 It must needs be necessary that ye save all the

25
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:12,475
 money that ye can, and that ye obtain all that ye

26
00:02:12,475 --> 00:02:16,075
 can in righteousness, that in time ye may be

27
00:02:16,075 --> 00:02:19,675
 enabled to purchase land for an inheritance, even the

28
00:02:19,675 --> 00:02:23,275
 city

29
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:27,243
5 The place is not yet to be revealed; but after

30
00:02:27,243 --> 00:02:31,443
 your brethren come from the east there are to be

31
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:35,643
 certain men appointed, and to them it shall be given

32
00:02:35,643 --> 00:02:39,843
 to know the place, or to them it shall be

33
00:02:39,843 --> 00:02:44,043
 revealed

34
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:48,137
6 And they shall be appointed to purchase the

35
00:02:48,137 --> 00:02:51,693
 lands, and to make a commencement to lay the

36
00:02:51,693 --> 00:02:55,249
 foundation of the city; and then shall ye begin to be

37
00:02:55,249 --> 00:02:58,805
 gathered with your families, every man according to his

38
00:02:58,805 --> 00:03:02,361
 family, according to his circumstances, and as is

39
00:03:02,361 --> 00:03:05,917
 appointed to him by the presidency and the bishop

40
00:03:05,917 --> 00:03:09,473
 of the church, according to the laws and

41
00:03:09,473 --> 00:03:13,029
 commandments which ye have received, and which ye shall

42
00:03:13,029 --> 00:03:16,585
 hereafter receive. Even so. Amen.
