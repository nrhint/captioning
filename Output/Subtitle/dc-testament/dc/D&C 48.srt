Section 48 Revelation given through Joseph

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, March 10,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
1831. The Prophet had inquired of the Lord as

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
to the mode of procedure in procuring lands for

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the settlement of the Saints. This was an

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
important matter in view of the migration of

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
members of the Church from the eastern United

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
States, in obedience to the Lord’s command that

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
they should assemble in Ohio (see 
sections

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
37:1–3; 
45:64). 
1–3, The Saints in Ohio are to

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
share their lands with their brethren; 
4–6,

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
The Saints are to purchase lands, build a city,

13
00:00:00,0 --> 01:22:52,
and follow the counsel of their presiding officers. 

14
01:22:52,0 --> 01:22:52,0
1 It is necessary that ye should remain for

15
01:22:52,0 --> 01:22:52,0
the present time in your places of abode, as

16
01:22:52,0 --> 01:33:25,
it shall be suitable to your circumstances.

17
01:33:25,0 --> 01:33:25,0
2 And inasmuch as ye have lands, ye

18
01:33:25,0 --> 01:45:03,
shall impart to the eastern brethren;

19
01:45:03,0 --> 01:45:03,0
3 And inasmuch as ye have not

20
01:45:03,0 --> 01:45:03,0
lands, let them buy for the present

21
01:45:03,0 --> 01:45:03,0
time in those regions round about,

22
01:45:03,0 --> 01:45:03,0
as seemeth them good, for it must

23
01:45:03,0 --> 01:45:03,0
needs be necessary that they have

24
01:45:03,0 --> 01:56:03,
places to live for the present time.

25
01:56:03,0 --> 01:56:03,0
4 It must needs be necessary that

26
01:56:03,0 --> 01:56:03,0
ye save all the money that ye can,

27
01:56:03,0 --> 01:56:03,0
and that ye obtain all that ye

28
01:56:03,0 --> 01:56:03,0
can in righteousness, that in time

29
01:56:03,0 --> 01:56:03,0
ye may be enabled to purchase land

30
01:56:03,0 --> 02:03:06,
for an inheritance, even the city.

31
02:03:06,0 --> 02:03:06,0
5 The place is not yet to be

32
02:03:06,0 --> 02:03:06,0
revealed; but after your brethren

33
02:03:06,0 --> 02:03:06,0
come from the east there are to be

34
02:03:06,0 --> 02:03:06,0
certain men appointed, and to them

35
02:03:06,0 --> 02:03:06,0
it shall be given to know the

36
02:03:06,0 --> 02:04:10,
place, or to them it shall be revealed.

37
02:04:10,0 --> 02:04:10,0
6 And they shall be appointed

38
02:04:10,0 --> 02:04:10,0
to purchase the lands, and to

39
02:04:10,0 --> 02:04:10,0
make a commencement to lay the

40
02:04:10,0 --> 02:04:10,0
foundation of the city; and

41
02:04:10,0 --> 02:04:10,0
then shall ye begin to be

42
02:04:10,0 --> 02:04:10,0
gathered with your families, every

43
02:04:10,0 --> 02:04:10,0
man according to his family,

44
02:04:10,0 --> 02:04:10,0
according to his circumstances,

45
02:04:10,0 --> 02:04:10,0
and as is appointed to him by

46
02:04:10,0 --> 02:04:10,0
the presidency and the bishop

47
02:04:10,0 --> 02:04:10,0
of the church, according to

48
02:04:10,0 --> 02:04:10,0
the laws and commandments which

49
02:04:10,0 --> 02:04:10,0
ye have received, and which

50
02:04:10,0 --> 02:21:11,
ye shall hereafter receive. Even so. Amen.
