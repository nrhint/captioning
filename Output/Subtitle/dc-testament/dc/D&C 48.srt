00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:02,615
Section 48 Revelation given through Joseph

2
00:00:02,615 --> 00:00:05,23
Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, March 10,

3
00:00:05,23 --> 00:00:07,845
1831. The Prophet had inquired of the Lord as

4
00:00:07,845 --> 00:00:10,46
to the mode of procedure in procuring lands for

5
00:00:10,46 --> 00:00:13,075
the settlement of the Saints. This was an

6
00:00:13,075 --> 00:00:15,69
important matter in view of the migration of

7
00:00:15,69 --> 00:00:18,305
members of the Church from the eastern United

8
00:00:18,305 --> 00:00:20,92
States, in obedience to the Lord’s command that

9
00:00:20,92 --> 00:00:23,535
they should assemble in Ohio (see 
sections

10
00:00:23,535 --> 00:00:26,15
37:1–3; 
45:64). 
1–3, The Saints in Ohio are to

11
00:00:26,15 --> 00:00:28,765
share their lands with their brethren; 
4–6,

12
00:00:28,765 --> 00:00:31,38
The Saints are to purchase lands, build a city,

13
00:00:31,38 --> 00:00:34,985
and follow the counsel of their presiding officers. 

14
00:00:34,985 --> 00:00:50,652
1 It is necessary that ye should remain for

15
00:00:50,652 --> 00:01:06,319
the present time in your places of abode, as

16
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:21,999
it shall be suitable to your circumstances.

17
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:21,999
2 And inasmuch as ye have lands, ye

18
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:21,632
shall impart to the eastern brethren;

19
00:01:21,632 --> 00:01:20,965
3 And inasmuch as ye have not

20
00:01:20,965 --> 00:01:20,298
lands, let them buy for the present

21
00:01:20,298 --> 00:01:19,631
time in those regions round about,

22
00:01:19,631 --> 00:01:18,964
as seemeth them good, for it must

23
00:01:18,964 --> 00:01:18,297
needs be necessary that they have

24
00:01:18,297 --> 00:01:17,294
places to live for the present time.

25
00:01:17,294 --> 00:01:18,127
4 It must needs be necessary that

26
00:01:18,127 --> 00:01:18,96
ye save all the money that ye can,

27
00:01:18,96 --> 00:01:19,793
and that ye obtain all that ye

28
00:01:19,793 --> 00:01:20,626
can in righteousness, that in time

29
00:01:20,626 --> 00:01:21,459
ye may be enabled to purchase land

30
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:22,382
for an inheritance, even the city.

31
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:22,382
5 The place is not yet to be

32
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:22,382
revealed; but after your brethren

33
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:22,382
come from the east there are to be

34
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:22,382
certain men appointed, and to them

35
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:22,382
it shall be given to know the

36
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:22,015
place, or to them it shall be revealed.

37
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:21,944
6 And they shall be appointed

38
00:01:21,944 --> 00:01:21,873
to purchase the lands, and to

39
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:21,802
make a commencement to lay the

40
00:01:21,802 --> 00:01:21,731
foundation of the city; and

41
00:01:21,731 --> 00:01:21,66
then shall ye begin to be

42
00:01:21,66 --> 00:01:21,589
gathered with your families, every

43
00:01:21,589 --> 00:01:21,518
man according to his family,

44
00:01:21,518 --> 00:01:21,447
according to his circumstances,

45
00:01:21,447 --> 00:01:21,376
and as is appointed to him by

46
00:01:21,376 --> 00:01:21,305
the presidency and the bishop

47
00:01:21,305 --> 00:01:21,234
of the church, according to

48
00:01:21,234 --> 00:01:21,163
the laws and commandments which

49
00:01:21,163 --> 00:01:21,092
ye have received, and which

50
00:01:21,092 --> 00:01:21,648
ye shall hereafter receive. Even so. Amen.
