19
01:16:56,0 --> 01:31:58,
the Holy Spirit by the laying on of hands;

20
01:31:58,0 --> 01:31:58,0
2 And then thou shalt be ordained by

21
01:31:58,0 --> 01:31:58,0

27
01:44:34,0 --> 01:44:34,0
lay your hands, if they are

28
01:44:34,0 --> 01:44:34,0
contrite before me, you shall

29
01:44:34,0 --> 01:48:41,
have power to give the Holy Spirit.

30
01:48:41,0 --> 01:48:41,0

them. The residue

hereafter, even as I will. Amen.
