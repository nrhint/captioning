 the Prophet to William W. Phelps, at Kirtland,

3
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:29,278
 Ohio, June 14, 1831. William W. Phelps, a printer, and

4
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:35,278
 his family had just arrived at Kirtland, and the

5
00:00:35,278 --> 00:00:41,278
 Prophet sought the Lord for information concerning

6
00:00:41,278 --> 00:00:47,278
 him. 
1–3, William W. Phelps is called and chosen

7
00:00:47,278 --> 00:00:53,278
 to be baptized, to be ordained an elder, and to

8
00:00:53,278 --> 00:00:59,278
 preach the gospel;

 for children in Church schools;

10
00:01:05,278 --> 00:01:11,278
 travel to Missouri, which will be the area of his

11
00:01:11,278 --> 00:01:17,278
 labors.

12
00:01:17,694 --> 00:01:22,265
1 Behold, thus saith the Lord unto you, my servant

13
00:01:22,265 --> 00:01:26,836
 William, yea, even the Lord of the whole earth,

14
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:31,407
 thou art called and chosen; and after thou hast

15
00:01:31,407 --> 00:01:35,978
 been baptized by water, which if you do with an eye

16
00:01:35,978 --> 00:01:40,549
 single to my glory, you shall have a remission of

17
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:45,12
 your sins and a reception of the Holy Spirit by the

18
00:01:45,12 --> 00:01:49,691
 laying on of hands

19
00:01:49,66 --> 00:01:54,06
2 And then thou shalt be ordained by the hand of

20
00:01:54,06 --> 00:01:58,46
 my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., to be an elder unto

21
00:01:58,46 --> 00:02:02,86
 this church, to preach repentance and remission of

22
00:02:02,86 --> 00:02:07,26
 sins by way of baptism in the name of Jesus

23
00:02:07,26 --> 00:02:11,66
 Christ, the Son of the living God

24
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:15,531
3 And on whomsoever you shall lay your hands, if

25
00:02:15,531 --> 00:02:19,864
 they are contrite before me, you shall have power

26
00:02:19,864 --> 00:02:24,197
 to give the Holy Spirit

27
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:30,711
4 And again, you shall be ordained to assist my

28
00:02:30,711 --> 00:02:36,711
 servant Oliver Cowdery to do the work of printing,

29
00:02:36,711 --> 00:02:42,711
 and of selecting and writing books for schools in

30
00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:48,711
 this church, that little children also may receive

31
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:54,711
 instruction before me as is pleasing unto me

32
00:02:54,224 --> 00:02:59,224
5 And again, verily I say unto you, for this cause

33
00:02:59,224 --> 00:03:04,224
 you shall take your journey with my servants

34
00:03:04,224 --> 00:03:09,224
 Joseph Smith, Jun., and Sidney Rigdon, that you may be

35
00:03:09,224 --> 00:03:14,224
 planted in the land of your inheritance to do

36
00:03:14,224 --> 00:03:19,224
 this work

37
00:03:19,249 --> 00:03:23,249
6 And again, let my servant Joseph Coe also take

38
00:03:23,249 --> 00:03:27,249
 his journey with them. The residue shall be made

39
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:31,249
 known hereafter, even as I will. Amen.
