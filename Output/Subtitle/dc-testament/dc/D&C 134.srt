00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 134 A declaration of belief regarding

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
governments and laws in general, adopted by

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
unanimous vote at a general assembly of the Church

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
held at Kirtland, Ohio, August 17, 1835. Many

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Saints gathered together to consider the proposed

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
contents of the first edition of the Doctrine and

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Covenants. At that time, this declaration was

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
given the following preamble: “That our belief with

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
regard to earthly governments and laws in

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
general may not be misinterpreted nor misunderstood,

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
we have thought proper to present, at the close

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of this volume, our opinion concerning the

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
same.” 
1–4, Governments should preserve freedom of

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
conscience and worship; 
5–8, All men should

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
uphold their governments and owe respect and

16
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
deference to the law; 
9–10, Religious societies should

17
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
not exercise civil powers; 
11–12, Men are

18
00:00:00,0 --> 02:38:44,
justified in defending themselves and their property. 

19
02:38:44,0 --> 02:38:44,0
1 We believe that governments were instituted

20
02:38:44,0 --> 02:38:44,0
of God for the benefit of man; and that he

21
02:38:44,0 --> 02:38:44,0
holds men accountable for their acts in

22
02:38:44,0 --> 02:38:44,0
relation to them, both in making laws and

23
02:38:44,0 --> 02:34:24,
administering them, for the good and safety of society.

24
02:34:24,0 --> 02:34:24,0
2 We believe that no government can

25
02:34:24,0 --> 02:34:24,0
exist in peace, except such laws are

26
02:34:24,0 --> 02:34:24,0
framed and held inviolate as will secure

27
02:34:24,0 --> 02:34:24,0
to each individual the free exercise

28
02:34:24,0 --> 02:34:24,0
of conscience, the right and control of

29
02:34:24,0 --> 02:39:29,
property, and the protection of life.

30
02:39:29,0 --> 02:39:29,0
3 We believe that all governments

31
02:39:29,0 --> 02:39:29,0
necessarily require civil officers

32
02:39:29,0 --> 02:39:29,0
and magistrates to enforce the laws

33
02:39:29,0 --> 02:39:29,0
of the same; and that such as will

34
02:39:29,0 --> 02:39:29,0
administer the law in equity and

35
02:39:29,0 --> 02:39:29,0
justice should be sought for and

36
02:39:29,0 --> 02:39:29,0
upheld by the voice of the people if a

37
02:39:29,0 --> 03:08:03,
republic, or the will of the sovereign.

38
03:08:03,0 --> 03:08:03,0
4 We believe that religion is

39
03:08:03,0 --> 03:08:03,0
instituted of God; and that men are

40
03:08:03,0 --> 03:08:03,0
amenable to him, and to him only,

41
03:08:03,0 --> 03:08:03,0
for the exercise of it, unless

42
03:08:03,0 --> 03:08:03,0
their religious opinions prompt

43
03:08:03,0 --> 03:08:03,0
them to infringe upon the rights

44
03:08:03,0 --> 03:08:03,0
and liberties of others; but we do

45
03:08:03,0 --> 03:08:03,0
not believe that human law has a

46
03:08:03,0 --> 03:08:03,0
right to interfere in prescribing

47
03:08:03,0 --> 03:08:03,0
rules of worship to bind the

48
03:08:03,0 --> 03:08:03,0
consciences of men, nor dictate

49
03:08:03,0 --> 03:08:03,0
forms for public or private devotion;

50
03:08:03,0 --> 03:08:03,0
that the civil magistrate should

51
03:08:03,0 --> 03:08:03,0
restrain crime, but never

52
03:08:03,0 --> 03:08:03,0
control conscience; should punish

53
03:08:03,0 --> 03:23:04,
guilt, but never suppress the freedom of the soul.

54
03:23:04,0 --> 03:23:04,0
5 We believe that all men are

55
03:23:04,0 --> 03:23:04,0
bound to sustain and uphold the

56
03:23:04,0 --> 03:23:04,0
respective governments in which

57
03:23:04,0 --> 03:23:04,0
they reside, while protected in

58
03:23:04,0 --> 03:23:04,0
their inherent and inalienable

59
03:23:04,0 --> 03:23:04,0
rights by the laws of such

60
03:23:04,0 --> 03:23:04,0
governments; and that sedition and

61
03:23:04,0 --> 03:23:04,0
rebellion are unbecoming every

62
03:23:04,0 --> 03:23:04,0
citizen thus protected, and should be

63
03:23:04,0 --> 03:23:04,0
punished accordingly; and that

64
03:23:04,0 --> 03:23:04,0
all governments have a right to

65
03:23:04,0 --> 03:23:04,0
enact such laws as in their own

66
03:23:04,0 --> 03:23:04,0
judgments are best calculated to

67
03:23:04,0 --> 03:23:04,0
secure the public interest; at

68
03:23:04,0 --> 03:23:04,0
the same time, however, holding

69
03:23:04,0 --> 03:34:04,
sacred the freedom of conscience.

70
03:34:04,0 --> 03:34:04,0
6 We believe that every man

71
03:34:04,0 --> 03:34:04,0
should be honored in his station,

72
03:34:04,0 --> 03:34:04,0
rulers and magistrates as such,

73
03:34:04,0 --> 03:34:04,0
being placed for the

74
03:34:04,0 --> 03:34:04,0
protection of the innocent and the

75
03:34:04,0 --> 03:34:04,0
punishment of the guilty; and that

76
03:34:04,0 --> 03:34:04,0
to the laws all men owe respect

77
03:34:04,0 --> 03:34:04,0
and deference, as without them

78
03:34:04,0 --> 03:34:04,0
peace and harmony would be

79
03:34:04,0 --> 03:34:04,0
supplanted by anarchy and terror;

80
03:34:04,0 --> 03:34:04,0
human laws being instituted for

81
03:34:04,0 --> 03:34:04,0
the express purpose of

82
03:34:04,0 --> 03:34:04,0
regulating our interests as individuals

83
03:34:04,0 --> 03:34:04,0
and nations, between man and

84
03:34:04,0 --> 03:34:04,0
man; and divine laws given of

85
03:34:04,0 --> 03:34:04,0
heaven, prescribing rules on

86
03:34:04,0 --> 03:34:04,0
spiritual concerns, for faith and

87
03:34:04,0 --> 03:43:07,
worship, both to be answered by man to his Maker.

88
03:43:07,0 --> 03:43:07,0
7 We believe that rulers,

89
03:43:07,0 --> 03:43:07,0
states, and governments have a

90
03:43:07,0 --> 03:43:07,0
right, and are bound to enact

91
03:43:07,0 --> 03:43:07,0
laws for the protection of all

92
03:43:07,0 --> 03:43:07,0
citizens in the free exercise of

93
03:43:07,0 --> 03:43:07,0
their religious belief; but

94
03:43:07,0 --> 03:43:07,0
we do not believe that they

95
03:43:07,0 --> 03:43:07,0
have a right in justice to

96
03:43:07,0 --> 03:43:07,0
deprive citizens of this privilege,

97
03:43:07,0 --> 03:43:07,0
or proscribe them in their

98
03:43:07,0 --> 03:43:07,0
opinions, so long as a regard and

99
03:43:07,0 --> 03:43:07,0
reverence are shown to the

100
03:43:07,0 --> 03:43:07,0
laws and such religious opinions

101
03:43:07,0 --> 04:24:06,
do not justify sedition nor conspiracy.

102
04:24:06,0 --> 04:24:06,0
8 We believe that the

103
04:24:06,0 --> 04:24:06,0
commission of crime should be

104
04:24:06,0 --> 04:24:06,0
punished according to the nature

105
04:24:06,0 --> 04:24:06,0
of the offense; that

106
04:24:06,0 --> 04:24:06,0
murder, treason, robbery, theft,

107
04:24:06,0 --> 04:24:06,0
and the breach of the general

108
04:24:06,0 --> 04:24:06,0
peace, in all respects,

109
04:24:06,0 --> 04:24:06,0
should be punished according to

110
04:24:06,0 --> 04:24:06,0
their criminality and their

111
04:24:06,0 --> 04:24:06,0
tendency to evil among men,

112
04:24:06,0 --> 04:24:06,0
by the laws of that

113
04:24:06,0 --> 04:24:06,0
government in which the offense is

114
04:24:06,0 --> 04:24:06,0
committed; and for the

115
04:24:06,0 --> 04:24:06,0
public peace and tranquility all

116
04:24:06,0 --> 04:24:06,0
men should step forward and

117
04:24:06,0 --> 04:24:06,0
use their ability in

118
04:24:06,0 --> 04:34:38,
bringing offenders against good laws to punishment.

119
04:34:38,0 --> 04:34:38,0
9 We do not believe it

120
04:34:38,0 --> 04:34:38,0
just to mingle religious

121
04:34:38,0 --> 04:34:38,0
influence with civil

122
04:34:38,0 --> 04:34:38,0
government, whereby one religious

123
04:34:38,0 --> 04:34:38,0
society is fostered and

124
04:34:38,0 --> 04:34:38,0
another proscribed in its

125
04:34:38,0 --> 04:34:38,0
spiritual privileges, and the

126
04:34:38,0 --> 04:34:38,0
individual rights of its

127
04:34:38,0 --> 05:20:38,
members, as citizens, denied.

128
05:20:38,0 --> 05:20:38,0
10 We believe that all

129
05:20:38,0 --> 05:20:38,0
religious societies have a

130
05:20:38,0 --> 05:20:38,0
right to deal with their

131
05:20:38,0 --> 05:20:38,0
members for disorderly

132
05:20:38,0 --> 05:20:38,0
conduct, according to the

133
05:20:38,0 --> 05:20:38,0
rules and regulations of

134
05:20:38,0 --> 05:20:38,0
such societies; provided

135
05:20:38,0 --> 05:20:38,0
that such dealings be for

136
05:20:38,0 --> 05:20:38,0
fellowship and good

137
05:20:38,0 --> 05:20:38,0
standing; but we do not

138
05:20:38,0 --> 05:20:38,0
believe that any religious

139
05:20:38,0 --> 05:20:38,0
society has authority to try

140
05:20:38,0 --> 05:20:38,0
men on the right of

141
05:20:38,0 --> 05:20:38,0
property or life, to take from

142
05:20:38,0 --> 05:20:38,0
them this world’s goods,

143
05:20:38,0 --> 05:20:38,0
or to put them in

144
05:20:38,0 --> 05:20:38,0
jeopardy of either life or

145
05:20:38,0 --> 05:20:38,0
limb, or to inflict any

146
05:20:38,0 --> 05:20:38,0
physical punishment upon them.

147
05:20:38,0 --> 05:20:38,0
They can only

148
05:20:38,0 --> 05:20:38,0
excommunicate them from their

149
05:20:38,0 --> 05:27:41,
society, and withdraw from them their fellowship.

150
05:27:41,0 --> 05:27:41,0
11 We believe that men

151
05:27:41,0 --> 05:27:41,0
should appeal to the

152
05:27:41,0 --> 05:27:41,0
civil law for redress of all

153
05:27:41,0 --> 05:27:41,0
wrongs and grievances,

154
05:27:41,0 --> 05:27:41,0
where personal abuse is

155
05:27:41,0 --> 05:27:41,0
inflicted or the right

156
05:27:41,0 --> 05:27:41,0
of property or character

157
05:27:41,0 --> 05:27:41,0
infringed, where such

158
05:27:41,0 --> 05:27:41,0
laws exist as will protect

159
05:27:41,0 --> 05:27:41,0
the same; but we

160
05:27:41,0 --> 05:27:41,0
believe that all men are

161
05:27:41,0 --> 05:27:41,0
justified in defending

162
05:27:41,0 --> 05:27:41,0
themselves, their friends, and

163
05:27:41,0 --> 05:27:41,0
property, and the

164
05:27:41,0 --> 05:27:41,0
government, from the unlawful

165
05:27:41,0 --> 05:27:41,0
assaults and

166
05:27:41,0 --> 05:27:41,0
encroachments of all persons in

167
05:27:41,0 --> 05:27:41,0
times of exigency, where

168
05:27:41,0 --> 05:27:41,0
immediate appeal cannot

169
05:27:41,0 --> 05:27:47,
be made to the laws, and relief afforded.

170
05:27:47,0 --> 05:27:47,0
12 We believe it just

171
05:27:47,0 --> 05:27:47,0
to preach the gospel to

172
05:27:47,0 --> 05:27:47,0
the nations of the

173
05:27:47,0 --> 05:27:47,0
earth, and warn the

174
05:27:47,0 --> 05:27:47,0
righteous to save themselves

175
05:27:47,0 --> 05:27:47,0
from the corruption of

176
05:27:47,0 --> 05:27:47,0
the world; but we do not

177
05:27:47,0 --> 05:27:47,0
believe it right to

178
05:27:47,0 --> 05:27:47,0
interfere with

179
05:27:47,0 --> 05:27:47,0
bond-servants, neither preach the

180
05:27:47,0 --> 05:27:47,0
gospel to, nor baptize

181
05:27:47,0 --> 05:27:47,0
them contrary to the

182
05:27:47,0 --> 05:27:47,0
will and wish of their

183
05:27:47,0 --> 05:27:47,0
masters, nor to meddle

184
05:27:47,0 --> 05:27:47,0
with or influence them

185
05:27:47,0 --> 05:27:47,0
in the least to cause

186
05:27:47,0 --> 05:27:47,0
them to be dissatisfied

187
05:27:47,0 --> 05:27:47,0
with their situations in

188
05:27:47,0 --> 05:27:47,0
this life, thereby

189
05:27:47,0 --> 05:27:47,0
jeopardizing the lives of

190
05:27:47,0 --> 05:27:47,0
men; such interference

191
05:27:47,0 --> 05:27:47,0
we believe to be

192
05:27:47,0 --> 05:27:47,0
unlawful and unjust, and

193
05:27:47,0 --> 05:27:47,0
dangerous to the peace of

194
05:27:47,0 --> 05:27:47,0
every government

195
05:27:47,0 --> 05:27:53,
allowing human beings to be held in servitude.
