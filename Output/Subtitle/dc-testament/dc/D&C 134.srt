00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:19,556
Section 134 A declaration of belief regarding

2
00:00:19,556 --> 00:00:27,834
 governments and laws in general, adopted by unanimous

3
00:00:27,834 --> 00:00:36,112
 vote at a general assembly of the Church held at

4
00:00:36,112 --> 00:00:44,39
 Kirtland, Ohio, August 17, 1835. Many Saints

5
00:00:44,39 --> 00:00:52,668
 gathered together to consider the proposed contents of

6
00:00:52,668 --> 00:01:00,946
 the first edition of the Doctrine and Covenants. At

7
00:01:00,946 --> 00:01:09,224
 that time, this declaration was given the

8
00:01:09,224 --> 00:01:17,502
 following preamble: “That our belief with regard to

9
00:01:17,502 --> 00:01:25,78
 earthly governments and laws in general may not be

10
00:01:25,78 --> 00:01:34,058
 misinterpreted nor misunderstood, we have thought

11
00:01:34,058 --> 00:01:42,336
 proper to present, at the close of this volume, our

12
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:50,614
 opinion concerning the same.” 
1–4, Governments

13
00:01:50,614 --> 00:01:58,892
 should preserve freedom of conscience and worship;

14
00:01:58,892 --> 00:02:07,17
5–8, All men should uphold their governments and owe

15
00:02:07,17 --> 00:02:15,448
 respect and deference to the law; 
9–10,

16
00:02:15,448 --> 00:02:23,726
 Religious societies should not exercise civil powers;

17
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:32,004
11–12, Men are justified in defending themselves and

18
00:02:32,004 --> 00:02:40,282
 their property.

19
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:46,227
1 We believe that governments were instituted of

20
00:02:46,227 --> 00:02:51,827
 God for the benefit of man; and that he holds men

21
00:02:51,827 --> 00:02:57,427
 accountable for their acts in relation to them,

22
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:03,027
 both in making laws and administering them, for the

23
00:03:03,027 --> 00:03:08,627
 good and safety of society

24
00:03:08,638 --> 00:03:15,838
2 We believe that no government can exist in

25
00:03:15,838 --> 00:03:23,038
 peace, except such laws are framed and held inviolate

26
00:03:23,038 --> 00:03:30,238
 as will secure to each individual the free exercise

27
00:03:30,238 --> 00:03:37,438
 of conscience, the right and control of property,

28
00:03:37,438 --> 00:03:44,638
 and the protection of life

29
00:03:44,374 --> 00:03:51,207
3 We believe that all governments necessarily

30
00:03:51,207 --> 00:03:58,04
 require civil officers and magistrates to enforce the

31
00:03:58,04 --> 00:04:04,873
 laws of the same; and that such as will administer

32
00:04:04,873 --> 00:04:11,706
 the law in equity and justice should be sought

33
00:04:11,706 --> 00:04:18,539
 for and upheld by the voice of the people if a

34
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:25,372
 republic, or the will of the sovereign

35
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:34,456
4 We believe that religion is instituted of God;

36
00:04:34,456 --> 00:04:43,547
 and that men are amenable to him, and to him only,

37
00:04:43,547 --> 00:04:52,638
 for the exercise of it, unless their religious

38
00:04:52,638 --> 00:05:01,729
 opinions prompt them to infringe upon the rights and

39
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:10,82
 liberties of others; but we do not believe that

40
00:05:10,82 --> 00:05:19,911
 human law has a right to interfere in prescribing

41
00:05:19,911 --> 00:05:29,002
 rules of worship to bind the consciences of men, nor

42
00:05:29,002 --> 00:05:38,093
 dictate forms for public or private devotion;

43
00:05:38,093 --> 00:05:47,184
 that the civil magistrate should restrain crime, but

44
00:05:47,184 --> 00:05:56,275
 never control conscience; should punish guilt, but

45
00:05:56,275 --> 00:06:05,366
 never suppress the freedom of the soul

46
00:06:05,815 --> 00:06:11,633
5 We believe that all men are bound to sustain and

47
00:06:11,633 --> 00:06:17,451
 uphold the respective governments in which they

48
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:23,269
 reside, while protected in their inherent and

49
00:06:23,269 --> 00:06:29,087
 inalienable rights by the laws of such governments; and

50
00:06:29,087 --> 00:06:34,905
 that sedition and rebellion are unbecoming every

51
00:06:34,905 --> 00:06:40,723
 citizen thus protected, and should be punished

52
00:06:40,723 --> 00:06:46,541
 accordingly; and that all governments have a right to

53
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:52,359
 enact such laws as in their own judgments are

54
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:58,177
 best calculated to secure the public interest; at the

55
00:06:58,177 --> 00:07:03,995
 same time, however, holding sacred the freedom of

56
00:07:03,995 --> 00:07:09,813
 conscience

57
00:07:09,746 --> 00:07:19,329
6 We believe that every man should be honored in

58
00:07:19,329 --> 00:07:28,912
 his station, rulers and magistrates as such, being

59
00:07:28,912 --> 00:07:38,495
 placed for the protection of the innocent and the

60
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:48,078
 punishment of the guilty; and that to the laws all

61
00:07:48,078 --> 00:07:57,661
 men owe respect and deference, as without them

62
00:07:57,661 --> 00:08:07,244
 peace and harmony would be supplanted by anarchy and

63
00:08:07,244 --> 00:08:16,827
 terror; human laws being instituted for the

64
00:08:16,827 --> 00:08:26,41
 express purpose of regulating our interests as

65
00:08:26,41 --> 00:08:35,993
 individuals and nations, between man and man; and divine

66
00:08:35,993 --> 00:08:45,576
 laws given of heaven, prescribing rules on

67
00:08:45,576 --> 00:08:55,159
 spiritual concerns, for faith and worship, both to be

68
00:08:55,159 --> 00:09:04,742
 answered by man to his Maker

69
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:12,311
7 We believe that rulers, states, and governments

70
00:09:12,311 --> 00:09:19,978
 have a right, and are bound to enact laws for the

71
00:09:19,978 --> 00:09:27,645
 protection of all citizens in the free exercise of

72
00:09:27,645 --> 00:09:35,312
 their religious belief; but we do not believe

73
00:09:35,312 --> 00:09:42,979
 that they have a right in justice to deprive citizens

74
00:09:42,979 --> 00:09:50,646
 of this privilege, or proscribe them in their

75
00:09:50,646 --> 00:09:58,313
 opinions, so long as a regard and reverence are shown

76
00:09:58,313 --> 00:10:05,98
 to the laws and such religious opinions do not

77
00:10:05,98 --> 00:10:13,647
 justify sedition nor conspiracy

78
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:22,863
8 We believe that the commission of crime should

79
00:10:22,863 --> 00:10:31,863
 be punished according to the nature of the offense;

80
00:10:31,863 --> 00:10:40,863
 that murder, treason, robbery, theft, and the

81
00:10:40,863 --> 00:10:49,863
 breach of the general peace, in all respects, should

82
00:10:49,863 --> 00:10:58,863
 be punished according to their criminality and

83
00:10:58,863 --> 00:11:07,863
 their tendency to evil among men, by the laws of that

84
00:11:07,863 --> 00:11:16,863
 government in which the offense is committed; and

85
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:25,863
 for the public peace and tranquility all men

86
00:11:25,863 --> 00:11:34,863
 should step forward and use their ability in bringing

87
00:11:34,863 --> 00:11:43,863
 offenders against good laws to punishment

88
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:50,269
9 We do not believe it just to mingle religious

89
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:57,469
 influence with civil government, whereby one

90
00:11:57,469 --> 00:12:04,669
 religious society is fostered and another proscribed in

91
00:12:04,669 --> 00:12:11,869
 its spiritual privileges, and the individual rights

92
00:12:11,869 --> 00:12:19,069
 of its members, as citizens, denied

93
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:25,122
10 We believe that all religious societies have a

94
00:12:25,122 --> 00:12:30,872
 right to deal with their members for disorderly

95
00:12:30,872 --> 00:12:36,622
 conduct, according to the rules and regulations of

96
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:42,372
 such societies; provided that such dealings be for

97
00:12:42,372 --> 00:12:48,122
 fellowship and good standing; but we do not

98
00:12:48,122 --> 00:12:53,872
 believe that any religious society has authority to try

99
00:12:53,872 --> 00:12:59,622
 men on the right of property or life, to take from

100
00:12:59,622 --> 00:13:05,372
 them this world’s goods, or to put them in

101
00:13:05,372 --> 00:13:11,122
 jeopardy of either life or limb, or to inflict any

102
00:13:11,122 --> 00:13:16,872
 physical punishment upon them. They can only

103
00:13:16,872 --> 00:13:22,622
 excommunicate them from their society, and withdraw from

104
00:13:22,622 --> 00:13:28,372
 them their fellowship

105
00:13:28,091 --> 00:13:36,091
11 We believe that men should appeal to the civil

106
00:13:36,091 --> 00:13:44,091
 law for redress of all wrongs and grievances,

107
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:52,091
 where personal abuse is inflicted or the right of

108
00:13:52,091 --> 00:14:00,091
 property or character infringed, where such laws exist

109
00:14:00,091 --> 00:14:08,091
 as will protect the same; but we believe that all

110
00:14:08,091 --> 00:14:16,091
 men are justified in defending themselves, their

111
00:14:16,091 --> 00:14:24,091
 friends, and property, and the government, from

112
00:14:24,091 --> 00:14:32,091
 the unlawful assaults and encroachments of all

113
00:14:32,091 --> 00:14:40,091
 persons in times of exigency, where immediate appeal

114
00:14:40,091 --> 00:14:48,091
 cannot be made to the laws, and relief afforded

115
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:52,862
12 We believe it just to preach the gospel to the

116
00:14:52,862 --> 00:14:57,17
 nations of the earth, and warn the righteous to

117
00:14:57,17 --> 00:15:01,478
 save themselves from the corruption of the world;

118
00:15:01,478 --> 00:15:05,786
 but we do not believe it right to interfere with

119
00:15:05,786 --> 00:15:10,094
 bond-servants, neither preach the gospel to, nor

120
00:15:10,094 --> 00:15:14,402
 baptize them contrary to the will and wish of their

121
00:15:14,402 --> 00:15:18,71
 masters, nor to meddle with or influence them in the

122
00:15:18,71 --> 00:15:23,018
 least to cause them to be dissatisfied with their

123
00:15:23,018 --> 00:15:27,326
 situations in this life, thereby jeopardizing the

124
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:31,634
 lives of men; such interference we believe to be

125
00:15:31,634 --> 00:15:35,942
 unlawful and unjust, and dangerous to the peace of

126
00:15:35,942 --> 00:15:40,25
 every government allowing human beings to be held

127
00:15:40,25 --> 00:15:44,558
 in servitude.
