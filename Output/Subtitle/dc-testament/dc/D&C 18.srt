00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:19,078
Section 18 Revelation to Joseph Smith the Prophet,

2
00:00:19,078 --> 00:00:26,878
 Oliver Cowdery, and David Whitmer, given at

3
00:00:26,878 --> 00:00:34,678
 Fayette, New York, June 1829. According to the Prophet,

4
00:00:34,678 --> 00:00:42,478
 this revelation made known “the calling of twelve

5
00:00:42,478 --> 00:00:50,278
 apostles in these last days, and also

6
00:00:50,278 --> 00:00:58,078
 instructions relative to building up the Church.” 
1–5,

7
00:00:58,078 --> 00:01:05,878
 Scriptures show how to build up the Church; 
6–8, The

8
00:01:05,878 --> 00:01:13,678
 world is ripening in iniquity; 
9–16, The worth of

9
00:01:13,678 --> 00:01:21,478
 souls is great; 
17–25, To gain salvation, men

10
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:29,278
 must take upon themselves the name of Christ; 
26–36,

11
00:01:29,278 --> 00:01:37,078
 The calling and mission of the Twelve are

12
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:44,878
 revealed; 
37–39, Oliver Cowdery and David Whitmer are to

13
00:01:44,878 --> 00:01:52,678
 search out the Twelve; 
40–47, To gain salvation,

14
00:01:52,678 --> 00:02:00,478
 men must repent, be baptized, and keep the

15
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:08,278
 commandments.

16
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:14,262
1 Now, behold, because of the thing which you, my

17
00:02:14,262 --> 00:02:19,595
 servant Oliver Cowdery, have desired to know of

18
00:02:19,595 --> 00:02:24,928
 me, I give unto you these words

19
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:27,911
2 Behold, I have manifested unto you, by my Spirit

20
00:02:27,911 --> 00:02:31,411
 in many instances, that the things which you have

21
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:34,911
 written are true; wherefore you know that they

22
00:02:34,911 --> 00:02:38,411
 are true

23
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:42,592
3 And if you know that they are true, behold, I

24
00:02:42,592 --> 00:02:46,259
 give unto you a commandment, that you rely upon the

25
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:49,926
 things which are written

26
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:52,536
4 For in them are all things written concerning

27
00:02:52,536 --> 00:02:55,536
 the foundation of my church, my gospel, and my rock

28
00:02:55,536 --> 00:02:58,536


29
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:03,911
5 Wherefore, if you shall build up my church, upon

30
00:03:03,911 --> 00:03:09,244
 the foundation of my gospel and my rock, the

31
00:03:09,244 --> 00:03:14,577
 gates of hell shall not prevail against you

32
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:20,778
6 Behold, the world is ripening in iniquity; and

33
00:03:20,778 --> 00:03:27,028
 it must needs be that the children of men are

34
00:03:27,028 --> 00:03:33,278
 stirred up unto repentance, both the Gentiles and also

35
00:03:33,278 --> 00:03:39,528
 the house of Israel

36
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:43,536
7 Wherefore, as thou hast been baptized by the

37
00:03:43,536 --> 00:03:47,286
 hands of my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., according to

38
00:03:47,286 --> 00:03:51,036
 that which I have commanded him, he hath fulfilled

39
00:03:51,036 --> 00:03:54,786
 the thing which I commanded him

40
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:59,968
8 And now, marvel not that I have called him unto

41
00:03:59,968 --> 00:04:05,168
 mine own purpose, which purpose is known in me;

42
00:04:05,168 --> 00:04:10,368
 wherefore, if he shall be diligent in keeping my

43
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:15,568
 commandments he shall be blessed unto eternal life;

44
00:04:15,568 --> 00:04:20,768
 and his name is Joseph

45
00:04:20,26 --> 00:04:26,26
9 And now, Oliver Cowdery, I speak unto you, and

46
00:04:26,26 --> 00:04:32,26
 also unto David Whitmer, by the way of commandment;

47
00:04:32,26 --> 00:04:38,26
 for, behold, I command all men everywhere to

48
00:04:38,26 --> 00:04:44,26
 repent, and I speak unto you, even as unto Paul mine

49
00:04:44,26 --> 00:04:50,26
 apostle, for you are called even with that same

50
00:04:50,26 --> 00:04:56,26
 calling with which he was called

51
00:04:56,163 --> 00:05:02,663
10 Remember the worth of souls is great in the

52
00:05:02,663 --> 00:05:09,163
 sight of God

53
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:13,676
11 For, behold, the Lord your Redeemer suffered

54
00:05:13,676 --> 00:05:18,176
 death in the flesh; wherefore he suffered the pain

55
00:05:18,176 --> 00:05:22,676
 of all men, that all men might repent and come unto

56
00:05:22,676 --> 00:05:27,176
 him

57
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:33,595
12 And he hath risen again from the dead, that he

58
00:05:33,595 --> 00:05:39,262
 might bring all men unto him, on conditions of

59
00:05:39,262 --> 00:05:44,929
 repentance

60
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:48,011
13 And how great is his joy in the soul that

61
00:05:48,011 --> 00:05:51,511
 repenteth

62
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:55,785
14 Wherefore, you are called to cry repentance

63
00:05:55,785 --> 00:05:59,785
 unto this people

64
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:05,042
15 And if it so be that you should labor all your

65
00:06:05,042 --> 00:06:10,792
 days in crying repentance unto this people, and

66
00:06:10,792 --> 00:06:16,542
 bring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall

67
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:22,292
 be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father

68
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:29,233
16 And now, if your joy will be great with one

69
00:06:29,233 --> 00:06:35,483
 soul that you have brought unto me into the kingdom

70
00:06:35,483 --> 00:06:41,733
 of my Father, how great will be your joy if you

71
00:06:41,733 --> 00:06:47,983
 should bring many souls unto me

72
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:50,774
17 Behold, you have my gospel before you, and my

73
00:06:50,774 --> 00:06:54,274
 rock, and my salvation

74
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:58,797
18 Ask the Father in my name in faith, believing

75
00:06:58,797 --> 00:07:03,047
 that you shall receive, and you shall have the Holy

76
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:07,297
 Ghost, which manifesteth all things which are

77
00:07:07,297 --> 00:07:11,547
 expedient unto the children of men

78
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:16,898
19 And if you have not faith, hope, and charity,

79
00:07:16,898 --> 00:07:21,898
 you can do nothing

80
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:26,041
20 Contend against no church, save it be the

81
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:30,541
 church of the devil

82
00:07:30,15 --> 00:07:34,15
21 Take upon you the name of Christ, and speak the

83
00:07:34,15 --> 00:07:38,15
 truth in soberness

84
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:43,625
22 And as many as repent and are baptized in my

85
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:48,293
 name, which is Jesus Christ, and endure to the end,

86
00:07:48,293 --> 00:07:52,959
 the same shall be saved

87
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:56,238
23 Behold, Jesus Christ is the name which is given

88
00:07:56,238 --> 00:08:00,238
 of the Father, and there is none other name given

89
00:08:00,238 --> 00:08:04,238
 whereby man can be saved

90
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:08,317
24 Wherefore, all men must take upon them the name

91
00:08:08,317 --> 00:08:12,317
 which is given of the Father, for in that name

92
00:08:12,317 --> 00:08:16,317
 shall they be called at the last day

93
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:20,53
25 Wherefore, if they know not the name by which

94
00:08:20,53 --> 00:08:24,197
 they are called, they cannot have place in the

95
00:08:24,197 --> 00:08:27,864
 kingdom of my Father

96
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:32,574
26 And now, behold, there are others who are

97
00:08:32,574 --> 00:08:37,241
 called to declare my gospel, both unto Gentile and unto

98
00:08:37,241 --> 00:08:41,908
 Jew

99
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:47,638
27 Yea, even twelve; and the Twelve shall be my

100
00:08:47,638 --> 00:08:53,388
 disciples, and they shall take upon them my name;

101
00:08:53,388 --> 00:08:59,138
 and the Twelve are they who shall desire to take

102
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:04,888
 upon them my name with full purpose of heart

103
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:08,844
28 And if they desire to take upon them my name

104
00:09:08,844 --> 00:09:12,844
 with full purpose of heart, they are called to go

105
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:16,844
 into all the world to preach my gospel unto every

106
00:09:16,844 --> 00:09:20,844
 creature

107
00:09:20,56 --> 00:09:23,893
29 And they are they who are ordained of me to

108
00:09:23,893 --> 00:09:27,226
 baptize in my name, according to that which is

109
00:09:27,226 --> 00:09:30,559
 written

110
00:09:30,57 --> 00:09:34,903
30 And you have that which is written before you;

111
00:09:34,903 --> 00:09:39,236
 wherefore, you must perform it according to the

112
00:09:39,236 --> 00:09:43,569
 words which are written

113
00:09:43,85 --> 00:09:49,517
31 And now I speak unto you, the Twelve—Behold, my

114
00:09:49,517 --> 00:09:55,184
 grace is sufficient for you; you must walk

115
00:09:55,184 --> 00:10:00,851
 uprightly before me and sin not

116
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:05,667
32 And, behold, you are they who are ordained of

117
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:10,667
 me to ordain priests and teachers; to declare my

118
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:15,667
 gospel, according to the power of the Holy Ghost

119
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:20,667
 which is in you, and according to the callings and

120
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:25,667
 gifts of God unto men

121
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:29,425
33 And I, Jesus Christ, your Lord and your God,

122
00:10:29,425 --> 00:10:32,925
 have spoken it

123
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:38,932
34 These words are not of men nor of man, but of

124
00:10:38,932 --> 00:10:44,932
 me; wherefore, you shall testify they are of me and

125
00:10:44,932 --> 00:10:50,932
 not of man

126
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:55,233
35 For it is my voice which speaketh them unto

127
00:10:55,233 --> 00:10:59,983
 you; for they are given by my Spirit unto you, and by

128
00:10:59,983 --> 00:11:04,733
 my power you can read them one to another; and

129
00:11:04,733 --> 00:11:09,483
 save it were by my power you could not have them

130
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:13,502
36 Wherefore, you can testify that you have heard

131
00:11:13,502 --> 00:11:18,002
 my voice, and know my words

132
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:22,544
37 And now, behold, I give unto you, Oliver

133
00:11:22,544 --> 00:11:27,044
 Cowdery, and also unto David Whitmer, that you shall

134
00:11:27,044 --> 00:11:31,544
 search out the Twelve, who shall have the desires of

135
00:11:31,544 --> 00:11:36,044
 which I have spoken

136
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:40,063
38 And by their desires and their works you shall

137
00:11:40,063 --> 00:11:43,563
 know them

138
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:47,136
39 And when you have found them you shall show

139
00:11:47,136 --> 00:11:51,136
 these things unto them

140
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:55,978
40 And you shall fall down and worship the Father

141
00:11:55,978 --> 00:11:59,978
 in my name

142
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:03,953
41 And you must preach unto the world, saying: You

143
00:12:03,953 --> 00:12:07,953
 must repent and be baptized, in the name of Jesus

144
00:12:07,953 --> 00:12:11,953
 Christ

145
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:18,264
42 For all men must repent and be baptized, and

146
00:12:18,264 --> 00:12:24,597
 not only men, but women, and children who have

147
00:12:24,597 --> 00:12:30,93
 arrived at the years of accountability

148
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:36,417
43 And now, after that you have received this, you

149
00:12:36,417 --> 00:12:41,917
 must keep my commandments in all things

150
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:46,461
44 And by your hands I will work a marvelous work

151
00:12:46,461 --> 00:12:51,461
 among the children of men, unto the convincing of

152
00:12:51,461 --> 00:12:56,461
 many of their sins, that they may come unto

153
00:12:56,461 --> 00:13:01,461
 repentance, and that they may come unto the kingdom of

154
00:13:01,461 --> 00:13:06,461
 my Father

155
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:11,719
45 Wherefore, the blessings which I give unto you

156
00:13:11,719 --> 00:13:17,219
 are above all things

157
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:21,93
46 And after that you have received this, if you

158
00:13:21,93 --> 00:13:26,263
 keep not my commandments you cannot be saved in the

159
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:30,596
 kingdom of my Father

160
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:36,476
47 Behold, I, Jesus Christ, your Lord and your

161
00:13:36,476 --> 00:13:42,809
 God, and your Redeemer, by the power of my Spirit

162
00:13:42,809 --> 00:13:49,142
 have spoken it. Amen.
