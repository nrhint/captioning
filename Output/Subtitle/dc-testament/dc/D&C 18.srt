00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 18 Revelation to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Prophet, Oliver Cowdery, and David Whitmer, given at

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Fayette, New York, June 1829. According to the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Prophet, this revelation made known “the

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
calling of twelve apostles in these last days, and

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
also instructions relative to building up the

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Church.” 
1–5, Scriptures show how to build up

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Church; 
6–8, The world is ripening in

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
iniquity; 
9–16, The worth of souls is great; 
17–25,

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
To gain salvation, men must take upon

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
themselves the name of Christ; 
26–36, The calling and

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
mission of the Twelve are revealed; 
37–39,

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Oliver Cowdery and David Whitmer are to search out

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Twelve; 
40–47, To gain salvation, men

15
00:00:00,0 --> 01:03:58,
must repent, be baptized, and keep the commandments. 

16
01:03:58,0 --> 01:03:58,0
1 Now, behold, because of the thing which

17
01:03:58,0 --> 01:03:58,0
you, my servant Oliver Cowdery, have desired

18
01:03:58,0 --> 01:10:39,
to know of me, I give unto you these words:

19
01:10:39,0 --> 01:10:39,0
2 Behold, I have manifested unto you,

20
01:10:39,0 --> 01:10:39,0
by my Spirit in many instances, that the

21
01:10:39,0 --> 01:10:39,0
things which you have written are

22
01:10:39,0 --> 01:15:50,
true; wherefore you know that they are true.

23
01:15:50,0 --> 01:15:50,0
3 And if you know that they are

24
01:15:50,0 --> 01:15:50,0
true, behold, I give unto you

25
01:15:50,0 --> 01:15:50,0
a commandment, that you rely

26
01:15:50,0 --> 01:19:21,
upon the things which are written;

27
01:19:21,0 --> 01:19:21,0
4 For in them are all

28
01:19:21,0 --> 01:19:21,0
things written concerning

29
01:19:21,0 --> 01:19:21,0
the foundation of my

30
01:19:21,0 --> 01:24:32,
church, my gospel, and my rock.

31
01:24:32,0 --> 01:24:32,0
5 Wherefore, if you

32
01:24:32,0 --> 01:24:32,0
shall build up my church,

33
01:24:32,0 --> 01:24:32,0
upon the foundation of

34
01:24:32,0 --> 01:24:32,0
my gospel and my rock,

35
01:24:32,0 --> 01:24:32,0
the gates of hell shall

36
01:24:32,0 --> 01:28:03,
not prevail against you.

37
01:28:03,0 --> 01:28:03,0
6 Behold, the world

38
01:28:03,0 --> 01:28:03,0
is ripening in

39
01:28:03,0 --> 01:28:03,0
iniquity; and it must needs

40
01:28:03,0 --> 01:28:03,0
be that the children

41
01:28:03,0 --> 01:28:03,0
of men are stirred up

42
01:28:03,0 --> 01:28:03,0
unto repentance,

43
01:28:03,0 --> 01:28:03,0
both the Gentiles and

44
01:28:03,0 --> 01:36:45,
also the house of Israel.

45
01:36:45,0 --> 01:36:45,0
7 Wherefore, as thou

46
01:36:45,0 --> 01:36:45,0
hast been baptized

47
01:36:45,0 --> 01:36:45,0
by the hands of my

48
01:36:45,0 --> 01:36:45,0
servant Joseph Smith,

49
01:36:45,0 --> 01:36:45,0
Jun., according to

50
01:36:45,0 --> 01:36:45,0
that which I have

51
01:36:45,0 --> 01:36:45,0
commanded him, he hath

52
01:36:45,0 --> 01:36:45,0
fulfilled the thing

53
01:36:45,0 --> 01:39:55,
which I commanded him.

54
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
8 And now, marvel

55
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
not that I have

56
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
called him unto mine

57
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
own purpose,

58
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
which purpose is known

59
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
in me; wherefore,

60
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
if he shall be

61
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
diligent in keeping

62
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
my commandments he

63
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
shall be blessed

64
01:39:55,0 --> 01:39:55,0
unto eternal life;

65
01:39:55,0 --> 01:49:05,
and his name is Joseph.

66
01:49:05,0 --> 01:49:05,0
9 And now, Oliver

67
01:49:05,0 --> 01:49:05,0
Cowdery, I speak

68
01:49:05,0 --> 01:49:05,0
unto you, and

69
01:49:05,0 --> 01:49:05,0
also unto David

70
01:49:05,0 --> 01:49:05,0
Whitmer, by the way

71
01:49:05,0 --> 01:49:05,0
of commandment;

72
01:49:05,0 --> 01:49:05,0
for, behold, I

73
01:49:05,0 --> 01:49:05,0
command all men

74
01:49:05,0 --> 01:49:05,0
everywhere to repent,

75
01:49:05,0 --> 01:49:05,0
and I speak unto

76
01:49:05,0 --> 01:49:05,0
you, even as

77
01:49:05,0 --> 01:49:05,0
unto Paul mine

78
01:49:05,0 --> 01:49:05,0
apostle, for you are

79
01:49:05,0 --> 01:49:05,0
called even with

80
01:49:05,0 --> 01:49:05,0
that same calling

81
01:49:05,0 --> 01:57:03,
with which he was called.

82
01:57:03,0 --> 01:57:03,0
10 Remember the

83
01:57:03,0 --> 01:57:03,0
worth of souls

84
01:57:03,0 --> 01:57:03,0
is great in

85
01:57:03,0 --> 02:09:14,
the sight of God;

86
02:09:14,0 --> 02:09:14,0
11 For,

87
02:09:14,0 --> 02:09:14,0
behold, the Lord

88
02:09:14,0 --> 02:09:14,0
your Redeemer

89
02:09:14,0 --> 02:09:14,0
suffered death in

90
02:09:14,0 --> 02:09:14,0
the flesh;

91
02:09:14,0 --> 02:09:14,0
wherefore he

92
02:09:14,0 --> 02:09:14,0
suffered the pain

93
02:09:14,0 --> 02:09:14,0
of all men,

94
02:09:14,0 --> 02:09:14,0
that all men

95
02:09:14,0 --> 02:09:14,0
might repent and

96
02:09:14,0 --> 02:27:22,
come unto him.

97
02:27:22,0 --> 02:27:22,0
12 And he

98
02:27:22,0 --> 02:27:22,0
hath risen again

99
02:27:22,0 --> 02:27:22,0
from the

100
02:27:22,0 --> 02:27:22,0
dead, that he

101
02:27:22,0 --> 02:27:22,0
might bring all

102
02:27:22,0 --> 02:27:22,0
men unto

103
02:27:22,0 --> 02:27:22,0
him, on

104
02:27:22,0 --> 02:34:03,
conditions of repentance.

105
02:34:03,0 --> 02:34:03,0
13 And how

106
02:34:03,0 --> 02:34:03,0
great is

107
02:34:03,0 --> 02:34:03,0
his joy in

108
02:34:03,0 --> 02:34:03,0
the soul that

109
02:34:03,0 --> 02:43:12,
repenteth!

110
02:43:12,0 --> 02:43:12,0
14

111
02:43:12,0 --> 02:43:12,0
Wherefore, you

112
02:43:12,0 --> 02:43:12,0
are called

113
02:43:12,0 --> 02:43:12,0
to cry

114
02:43:12,0 --> 02:43:12,0
repentance

115
02:43:12,0 --> 02:51:24,
unto this people.

116
02:51:24,0 --> 02:51:24,0
15 And if

117
02:51:24,0 --> 02:51:24,0
it so be

118
02:51:24,0 --> 02:51:24,0
that you

119
02:51:24,0 --> 02:51:24,0
should

120
02:51:24,0 --> 02:51:24,0
labor all

121
02:51:24,0 --> 02:51:24,0
your days

122
02:51:24,0 --> 02:51:24,0
in

123
02:51:24,0 --> 02:51:24,0
crying

124
02:51:24,0 --> 02:51:24,0
repentance unto

125
02:51:24,0 --> 02:51:24,0
this

126
02:51:24,0 --> 02:51:24,0
people, and

127
02:51:24,0 --> 02:51:24,0
bring,

128
02:51:24,0 --> 02:51:24,0
save it be

129
02:51:24,0 --> 02:51:24,0
one soul

130
02:51:24,0 --> 02:51:24,0
unto me,

131
02:51:24,0 --> 02:51:24,0
how great

132
02:51:24,0 --> 02:51:24,0
shall be

133
02:51:24,0 --> 02:51:24,0
your joy

134
02:51:24,0 --> 02:51:24,0
with him

135
02:51:24,0 --> 02:53:36,
in the kingdom of my Father!

136
02:53:36,0 --> 02:53:36,0
16 And

137
02:53:36,0 --> 02:53:36,0
now, if

138
02:53:36,0 --> 02:53:36,0
your joy

139
02:53:36,0 --> 02:53:36,0
will be

140
02:53:36,0 --> 02:53:36,0
great

141
02:53:36,0 --> 02:53:36,0
with one

142
02:53:36,0 --> 02:53:36,0
soul that

143
02:53:36,0 --> 02:53:36,0
you

144
02:53:36,0 --> 02:53:36,0
have

145
02:53:36,0 --> 02:53:36,0
brought unto

146
02:53:36,0 --> 02:53:36,0
me into

147
02:53:36,0 --> 02:53:36,0
the

148
02:53:36,0 --> 02:53:36,0
kingdom of my

149
02:53:36,0 --> 02:53:36,0
Father,

150
02:53:36,0 --> 02:53:36,0
how

151
02:53:36,0 --> 02:53:36,0
great will

152
02:53:36,0 --> 02:53:36,0
be your

153
02:53:36,0 --> 02:53:36,0
joy if

154
02:53:36,0 --> 02:53:36,0
you

155
02:53:36,0 --> 02:53:08,
should bring many souls unto me!

156
02:53:08,0 --> 02:53:08,0
17

157
02:53:08,0 --> 02:53:08,0
Behold, you

158
02:53:08,0 --> 02:53:08,0
have my

159
02:53:08,0 --> 02:53:08,0
gospel

160
02:53:08,0 --> 02:53:08,0
before

161
02:53:08,0 --> 02:53:08,0
you, and my

162
02:53:08,0 --> 02:53:08,0
rock,

163
02:53:08,0 --> 02:53:08,0
and my

164
02:53:08,0 --> 02:54:52,
salvation.

165
02:54:52,0 --> 02:54:52,0
18 Ask

166
02:54:52,0 --> 02:54:52,0
the

167
02:54:52,0 --> 02:54:52,0
Father in

168
02:54:52,0 --> 02:54:52,0
my name

169
02:54:52,0 --> 02:54:52,0
in

170
02:54:52,0 --> 02:54:52,0
faith,

171
02:54:52,0 --> 02:54:52,0
believing

172
02:54:52,0 --> 02:54:52,0
that

173
02:54:52,0 --> 02:54:52,0
you shall

174
02:54:52,0 --> 02:54:52,0


175
02:54:52,0 --> 02:54:52,0
receive, and

02:54:52,0 --> 02:54:52,0
you

177
02:54:52,0 --> 02:54:52,0
shall have

Holy

180
02:54:52,0 --> 02:54:52,0
Ghost,

181
02:54:52,0 --> 02:54:52,0
which

182
02:54:52,0 --> 02:54:52,0
manifesteth

183
02:54:52,0 --> 02:54:52,0
all

184
02:54:52,0 --> 02:54:52,0
things

185
02:54:52,0 --> 02:54:52,0
which are

186
02:54:52,0 --> 02:54:52,0


187
02:54:52,0 --> 02:59:05,
expedient unto the children of men.

188
02:59:05,0 --> 02:59:05,0
19 And

189
02:59:05,0 --> 02:59:05,0
if

190
02:59:05,0 --> 02:59:05,0
you have

02:59:05,0 --> 02:59:05,0
you

197
02:59:05,0 --> 03:09:44,
can do nothing.

198

20

199
