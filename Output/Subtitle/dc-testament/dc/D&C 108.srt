00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
26, 1835. This section was received at the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
request of Lyman Sherman, who had previously been

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
ordained a seventy and who had come to the

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Prophet with a request for a revelation to make

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
known his duty. 
1–3, Lyman Sherman forgiven of

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
his sins; 
4–5, He is to be numbered with the

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
leading elders of the Church; 
6–8, He is

10
00:00:00,0 --> 01:10:55,
called to preach the gospel and strengthen his brethren. 

11
01:10:55,0 --> 01:10:55,0
1 Verily thus saith the Lord unto you,

12
01:10:55,0 --> 01:10:55,0
my servant Lyman: Your sins are

13
01:10:55,0 --> 01:10:55,0
forgiven you, because you have obeyed my voice

14
01:10:55,0 --> 01:10:55,0
in coming up hither this morning to

15
01:10:55,0 --> 01:11:59,
receive counsel of him whom I have appointed.

16
01:11:59,0 --> 01:11:59,0
2 Therefore, let your soul be at

17
01:11:59,0 --> 01:11:59,0
rest concerning your spiritual

18
01:11:59,0 --> 01:33:02,
standing, and resist no more my voice.

19
01:33:02,0 --> 01:33:02,0
3 And arise up and be more

20
01:33:02,0 --> 01:33:02,0
careful henceforth in observing

21
01:33:02,0 --> 01:33:02,0
your vows, which you have made and

22
01:33:02,0 --> 01:33:02,0
do make, and you shall be

23
01:33:02,0 --> 01:44:03,
blessed with exceeding great blessings.

24
01:44:03,0 --> 01:44:03,0
4 Wait patiently until the

25
01:44:03,0 --> 01:44:03,0
solemn assembly shall be called

26
01:44:03,0 --> 01:44:03,0
of my servants, then you shall

27
01:44:03,0 --> 01:44:03,0
be remembered with the first

28
01:44:03,0 --> 01:44:03,0
of mine elders, and receive

29
01:44:03,0 --> 01:44:03,0
right by ordination with the rest

30
01:44:03,0 --> 01:59:05,
of mine elders whom I have chosen.

31
01:59:05,0 --> 01:59:05,0
5 Behold, this is the

32
01:59:05,0 --> 01:59:05,0
promise of the Father unto you

33
01:59:05,0 --> 02:09:37,
if you continue faithful.

34
02:09:37,0 --> 02:09:37,0
6 And it shall be

35
02:09:37,0 --> 02:09:37,0
fulfilled upon you in that day

36
02:09:37,0 --> 02:09:37,0
that you shall have right to

37
02:09:37,0 --> 02:09:37,0
preach my gospel

38
02:09:37,0 --> 02:09:37,0
wheresoever I shall send you, from

39
02:09:37,0 --> 02:16:40,
henceforth from that time.

40
02:16:40,0 --> 02:16:40,0
7 Therefore,

41
02:16:40,0 --> 02:16:40,0
strengthen your brethren in all

42
02:16:40,0 --> 02:16:40,0
your conversation, in

43
02:16:40,0 --> 02:16:40,0
all your prayers, in

44
02:16:40,0 --> 02:16:40,0
all your exhortations,

45
02:16:40,0 --> 02:21:45,
and in all your doings.

46
02:21:45,0 --> 02:21:45,0
8 And behold, and

47
02:21:45,0 --> 02:21:45,0
lo, I am with you to

48
02:21:45,0 --> 02:21:45,0
bless you and deliver

49
02:21:45,0 --> 02:28:48,
you forever. Amen.
