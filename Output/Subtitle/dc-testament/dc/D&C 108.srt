1 Verily thus saith the Lord unto you, my servant

12
00:01:18,206 --> 00:01:23,456
 Lyman: Your sins are forgiven you, because you

13
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:28,706
 have obeyed my voice in coming up hither this morning

14
00:01:28,706 --> 00:01:33,956
 to receive counsel of him whom I have appointed

15
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:37,16
2 Therefore, let your soul be at rest concerning

16
00:01:37,16 --> 00:01:40,827
 your spiritual standing, and resist no more my

17
00:01:40,827 --> 00:01:44,494
 voice

18
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:48,304
3 And arise up and be more careful henceforth in

19
00:01:48,304 --> 00:01:52,304
 observing your vows, which you have made and do

20
00:01:52,304 --> 00:01:56,304
 make, and you shall be blessed with exceeding great

21
00:01:56,304 --> 00:02:00,304
 blessings

22
00:02:00,837 --> 00:02:05,237
4 Wait patiently until the solemn assembly shall

23
00:02:05,237 --> 00:02:09,637
 be called of my servants, then you shall be

24
00:02:09,637 --> 00:02:14,037
 remembered with the first of mine elders, and receive

25
00:02:14,037 --> 00:02:18,437
 right by ordination with the rest of mine elders whom

26
00:02:18,437 --> 00:02:22,837
 I have chosen

27
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:26,342
5 Behold, this is the promise of the Father unto

28
00:02:26,342 --> 00:02:30,342
 you if you continue faithful

29
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:34,384
6 And it shall be fulfilled upon you in that day

30
00:02:34,384 --> 00:02:37,884
 that you shall have right to preach my gospel

31
00:02:37,884 --> 00:02:41,384
 wheresoever I shall send you, from henceforth from that

32
00:02:41,384 --> 00:02:44,884
 time

33
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:48,831
7 Therefore, strengthen your brethren in all your

34
00:02:48,831 --> 00:02:53,498
 conversation, in all your prayers, in all your

35
00:02:53,498 --> 00:02:58,165
 exhortations, and in all your doings

36
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:03,978
8 And behold, and lo, I am with you to bless you

37
00:03:03,978 --> 00:03:09,478
 and deliver you forever. Amen.
