1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 28 Revelation given through Joseph

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Smith the Prophet to Oliver Cowdery, at Fayette,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
New York, September 1830. Hiram Page, a member of

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Church, had a certain stone and professed

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
to be receiving revelations by its aid

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
concerning the upbuilding of Zion and the order of the

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Church. Several members had been deceived by

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
these claims, and even Oliver Cowdery was wrongly

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
influenced thereby. Just prior to an appointed

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
conference, the Prophet inquired earnestly of

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Lord concerning the matter, and this

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
revelation followed. 
1–7, Joseph Smith holds the

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
keys of the mysteries, and only he receives

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
revelations for the Church; 
8–10, Oliver Cowdery is

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
to preach to the Lamanites; 
11–16, Satan

16
00:00:00,0 --> 00:55:32,
deceived Hiram Page and gave him false revelations. 

17
00:55:32,0 --> 00:55:32,0
1 Behold, I say unto thee, Oliver, that it

18
00:55:32,0 --> 00:55:32,0
shall be given unto thee that thou shalt be heard

19
00:55:32,0 --> 00:55:32,0
by the church in all things whatsoever thou

20
00:55:32,0 --> 00:55:32,0
shalt teach them by the Comforter, concerning the

21
00:55:32,0 --> 01:05:42,
revelations and commandments which I have given.

22
01:05:42,0 --> 01:05:42,0
2 But, behold, verily, verily, I say unto

23
01:05:42,0 --> 01:05:42,0
thee, no one shall be appointed to

24
01:05:42,0 --> 01:05:42,0
receive commandments and revelations in this

25
01:05:42,0 --> 01:05:42,0
church excepting my servant Joseph Smith,

26
01:05:42,0 --> 01:10:53,
Jun., for he receiveth them even as Moses.

27
01:10:53,0 --> 01:10:53,0
3 And thou shalt be obedient unto the

28
01:10:53,0 --> 01:10:53,0
things which I shall give unto him,

29
01:10:53,0 --> 01:10:53,0
even as Aaron, to declare faithfully the

30
01:10:53,0 --> 01:10:53,0
commandments and the revelations,

31
01:10:53,0 --> 01:23:04,
with power and authority unto the church.

32
01:23:04,0 --> 01:23:04,0
4 And if thou art led at any time by

33
01:23:04,0 --> 01:23:04,0
the Comforter to speak or teach, or

34
01:23:04,0 --> 01:23:04,0
at all times by the way of

35
01:23:04,0 --> 01:36:13,
commandment unto the church, thou mayest do it.

36
01:36:13,0 --> 01:36:13,0
5 But thou shalt not write by

37
01:36:13,0 --> 01:47:06,
way of commandment, but by wisdom;

38
01:47:06,0 --> 01:47:06,0
6 And thou shalt not

39
01:47:06,0 --> 01:47:06,0
command him who is at thy head,

40
01:47:06,0 --> 01:51:19,
and at the head of the church;

41
01:51:19,0 --> 01:51:19,0
7 For I have given him

42
01:51:19,0 --> 01:51:19,0
the keys of the

43
01:51:19,0 --> 01:51:19,0
mysteries, and the revelations

44
01:51:19,0 --> 01:51:19,0
which are sealed,

45
01:51:19,0 --> 01:51:19,0
until I shall appoint unto

46
01:51:19,0 --> 01:56:30,
them another in his stead.

47
01:56:30,0 --> 01:56:30,0
8 And now, behold, I

48
01:56:30,0 --> 01:56:30,0
say unto you that you

49
01:56:30,0 --> 01:56:30,0
shall go unto the

50
01:56:30,0 --> 01:56:30,0
Lamanites and preach my

51
01:56:30,0 --> 01:56:30,0
gospel unto them;

52
01:56:30,0 --> 01:56:30,0
and inasmuch as they

53
01:56:30,0 --> 01:56:30,0
receive thy teachings

54
01:56:30,0 --> 01:56:30,0
thou shalt cause my

55
01:56:30,0 --> 01:56:30,0
church to be

56
01:56:30,0 --> 01:56:30,0
established among them; and

57
01:56:30,0 --> 01:56:30,0
thou shalt have

58
01:56:30,0 --> 01:56:30,0
revelations, but write them

59
01:56:30,0 --> 02:06:40,
not by way of commandment.

60
02:06:40,0 --> 02:06:40,0
9 And now, behold,

61
02:06:40,0 --> 02:06:40,0
I say unto you that

62
02:06:40,0 --> 02:06:40,0
it is not

63
02:06:40,0 --> 02:06:40,0
revealed, and no man

64
02:06:40,0 --> 02:06:40,0
knoweth where the city

65
02:06:40,0 --> 02:06:40,0
Zion shall be built,

66
02:06:40,0 --> 02:06:40,0
but it shall be

67
02:06:40,0 --> 02:06:40,0
given hereafter.

68
02:06:40,0 --> 02:06:40,0
Behold, I say unto you

69
02:06:40,0 --> 02:06:40,0
that it shall be on

70
02:06:40,0 --> 02:19:49,
the borders by the Lamanites.

71
02:19:49,0 --> 02:19:49,0
10 Thou shalt not

72
02:19:49,0 --> 02:19:49,0
leave this place

73
02:19:49,0 --> 02:19:49,0
until after the

74
02:19:49,0 --> 02:19:49,0
conference; and

75
02:19:49,0 --> 02:19:49,0
my servant Joseph

76
02:19:49,0 --> 02:19:49,0
shall be

77
02:19:49,0 --> 02:19:49,0
appointed to preside over

78
02:19:49,0 --> 02:19:49,0
the conference

79
02:19:49,0 --> 02:19:49,0
by the voice of

80
02:19:49,0 --> 02:19:49,0
it, and what he

81
02:19:49,0 --> 02:35:17,
saith to thee thou shalt tell.

82
02:35:17,0 --> 02:35:17,0
11 And again,

83
02:35:17,0 --> 02:35:17,0
thou shalt take

84
02:35:17,0 --> 02:35:17,0
thy brother, Hiram

85
02:35:17,0 --> 02:35:17,0
Page, between

86
02:35:17,0 --> 02:35:17,0
him and thee

87
02:35:17,0 --> 02:35:17,0
alone, and tell him

88
02:35:17,0 --> 02:35:17,0
that those

89
02:35:17,0 --> 02:35:17,0
things which he hath

90
02:35:17,0 --> 02:35:17,0
written from

91
02:35:17,0 --> 02:35:17,0
that stone are not

92
02:35:17,0 --> 02:35:17,0
of me and that

93
02:35:17,0 --> 02:40:27,
Satan deceiveth him;

94
02:40:27,0 --> 02:40:27,0
12 For, behold,

95
02:40:27,0 --> 02:40:27,0
these things

96
02:40:27,0 --> 02:40:27,0
have not been

97
02:40:27,0 --> 02:40:27,0
appointed unto

98
02:40:27,0 --> 02:40:27,0
him, neither

99
02:40:27,0 --> 02:40:27,0
shall anything be

100
02:40:27,0 --> 02:40:27,0
appointed unto

101
02:40:27,0 --> 02:40:27,0
any of this

102
02:40:27,0 --> 02:40:27,0
church contrary to

103
02:40:27,0 --> 02:49:23,
the church covenants.

104
02:49:23,0 --> 02:49:23,0
13 For all

105
02:49:23,0 --> 02:49:23,0
things must be

106
02:49:23,0 --> 02:49:23,0
done in order,

107
02:49:23,0 --> 02:49:23,0
and by common

108
02:49:23,0 --> 02:49:23,0
consent in the

109
02:49:23,0 --> 02:49:23,0
church, by the

110
02:49:23,0 --> 02:54:34,
prayer of faith.

111
02:54:34,0 --> 02:54:34,0
14 And thou

112
02:54:34,0 --> 02:54:34,0
shalt assist

113
02:54:34,0 --> 02:54:34,0
to settle all

114
02:54:34,0 --> 02:54:34,0
these things,

115
02:54:34,0 --> 02:54:34,0
according to

116
02:54:34,0 --> 02:54:34,0
the

117
02:54:34,0 --> 02:54:34,0
covenants of the

118
02:54:34,0 --> 02:54:34,0
church, before

119
02:54:34,0 --> 02:54:34,0
thou shalt take

120
02:54:34,0 --> 02:54:34,0
thy journey

121
02:54:34,0 --> 02:58:47,
among the Lamanites.

122
02:58:47,0 --> 02:58:47,0
15 And it

123
02:58:47,0 --> 02:58:47,0
shall be given

124
02:58:47,0 --> 02:58:47,0
thee from

125
02:58:47,0 --> 02:58:47,0
the time thou

126
02:58:47,0 --> 02:58:47,0
shalt go,

127
02:58:47,0 --> 02:58:47,0
until the

128
02:58:47,0 --> 02:58:47,0
time thou shalt

129
02:58:47,0 --> 02:58:47,0
return,

130
02:58:47,0 --> 03:03:30,
what thou shalt do.

131
03:03:30,0 --> 03:03:30,0
16 And thou

132
03:03:30,0 --> 03:03:30,0
must open

133
03:03:30,0 --> 03:03:30,0
thy mouth

134
03:03:30,0 --> 03:03:30,0
at all

135
03:03:30,0 --> 03:03:30,0
times, declaring

136
03:03:30,0 --> 03:03:30,0
my gospel

137
03:03:30,0 --> 03:03:30,0
with the

138
03:03:30,0 --> 03:03:30,0
sound of

139
03:03:30,0 --> 03:12:40,
rejoicing. Amen.
