1
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:17,528
Section 28 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:17,528 --> 00:00:23,778
 the Prophet to Oliver Cowdery, at Fayette, New

3
00:00:23,778 --> 00:00:30,028
 York, September 1830. Hiram Page, a member of the

4
00:00:30,028 --> 00:00:36,278
 Church, had a certain stone and professed to be

5
00:00:36,278 --> 00:00:42,528
 receiving revelations by its aid concerning the

6
00:00:42,528 --> 00:00:48,778
 upbuilding of Zion and the order of the Church. Several

7
00:00:48,778 --> 00:00:55,028
 members had been deceived by these claims, and even

8
00:00:55,028 --> 00:01:01,278
 Oliver Cowdery was wrongly influenced thereby.

9
00:01:01,278 --> 00:01:07,528
 Just prior to an appointed conference, the Prophet

10
00:01:07,528 --> 00:01:13,778
 inquired earnestly of the Lord concerning the

11
00:01:13,778 --> 00:01:20,028
 matter, and this revelation followed. 
1–7, Joseph Smith

12
00:01:20,028 --> 00:01:26,278
 holds the keys of the mysteries, and only he

13
00:01:26,278 --> 00:01:32,528
 receives revelations for the Church; 
8–10, Oliver

14
00:01:32,528 --> 00:01:38,778
 Cowdery is to preach to the Lamanites; 
11–16, Satan

15
00:01:38,778 --> 00:01:45,028
 deceived Hiram Page and gave him false

16
00:01:45,028 --> 00:01:51,278
 revelations.

17
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:57,945
1 Behold, I say unto thee, Oliver, that it shall

18
00:01:57,945 --> 00:02:04,145
 be given unto thee that thou shalt be heard by the

19
00:02:04,145 --> 00:02:10,345
 church in all things whatsoever thou shalt teach

20
00:02:10,345 --> 00:02:16,545
 them by the Comforter, concerning the revelations

21
00:02:16,545 --> 00:02:22,745
 and commandments which I have given

22
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:27,442
2 But, behold, verily, verily, I say unto thee, no

23
00:02:27,442 --> 00:02:32,442
 one shall be appointed to receive commandments

24
00:02:32,442 --> 00:02:37,442
 and revelations in this church excepting my servant

25
00:02:37,442 --> 00:02:42,442
 Joseph Smith, Jun., for he receiveth them even as

26
00:02:42,442 --> 00:02:47,442
 Moses

27
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:54,034
3 And thou shalt be obedient unto the things which

28
00:02:54,034 --> 00:03:00,534
 I shall give unto him, even as Aaron, to declare

29
00:03:00,534 --> 00:03:07,034
 faithfully the commandments and the revelations,

30
00:03:07,034 --> 00:03:13,534
 with power and authority unto the church

31
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:20,493
4 And if thou art led at any time by the Comforter

32
00:03:20,493 --> 00:03:27,493
 to speak or teach, or at all times by the way of

33
00:03:27,493 --> 00:03:34,493
 commandment unto the church, thou mayest do it

34
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:39,481
5 But thou shalt not write by way of commandment,

35
00:03:39,481 --> 00:03:43,981
 but by wisdom

36
00:03:43,59 --> 00:03:48,59
6 And thou shalt not command him who is at thy

37
00:03:48,59 --> 00:03:53,59
 head, and at the head of the church

38
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:56,3
7 For I have given him the keys of the mysteries,

39
00:03:56,3 --> 00:03:58,967
 and the revelations which are sealed, until I

40
00:03:58,967 --> 00:04:01,634
 shall appoint unto them another in his stead

41
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:08,441
8 And now, behold, I say unto you that you shall

42
00:04:08,441 --> 00:04:15,274
 go unto the Lamanites and preach my gospel unto

43
00:04:15,274 --> 00:04:22,107
 them; and inasmuch as they receive thy teachings thou

44
00:04:22,107 --> 00:04:28,94
 shalt cause my church to be established among

45
00:04:28,94 --> 00:04:35,773
 them; and thou shalt have revelations, but write them

46
00:04:35,773 --> 00:04:42,606
 not by way of commandment

47
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:47,882
9 And now, behold, I say unto you that it is not

48
00:04:47,882 --> 00:04:53,682
 revealed, and no man knoweth where the city Zion

49
00:04:53,682 --> 00:04:59,482
 shall be built, but it shall be given hereafter.

50
00:04:59,482 --> 00:05:05,282
 Behold, I say unto you that it shall be on the

51
00:05:05,282 --> 00:05:11,082
 borders by the Lamanites

52
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:18,044
10 Thou shalt not leave this place until after the

53
00:05:18,044 --> 00:05:25,044
 conference; and my servant Joseph shall be

54
00:05:25,044 --> 00:05:32,044
 appointed to preside over the conference by the voice of

55
00:05:32,044 --> 00:05:39,044
 it, and what he saith to thee thou shalt tell

56
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:46,773
11 And again, thou shalt take thy brother, Hiram

57
00:05:46,773 --> 00:05:53,773
 Page, between him and thee alone, and tell him that

58
00:05:53,773 --> 00:06:00,773
 those things which he hath written from that

59
00:06:00,773 --> 00:06:07,773
 stone are not of me and that Satan deceiveth him

60
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:12,767
12 For, behold, these things have not been

61
00:06:12,767 --> 00:06:17,767
 appointed unto him, neither shall anything be appointed

62
00:06:17,767 --> 00:06:22,767
 unto any of this church contrary to the church

63
00:06:22,767 --> 00:06:27,767
 covenants

64
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:31,921
13 For all things must be done in order, and by

65
00:06:31,921 --> 00:06:36,588
 common consent in the church, by the prayer of

66
00:06:36,588 --> 00:06:41,255
 faith

67
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:45,784
14 And thou shalt assist to settle all these

68
00:06:45,784 --> 00:06:50,034
 things, according to the covenants of the church,

69
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:54,284
 before thou shalt take thy journey among the Lamanites

70
00:06:54,284 --> 00:06:58,534


71
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:02,818
15 And it shall be given thee from the time thou

72
00:07:02,818 --> 00:07:06,818
 shalt go, until the time thou shalt return, what

73
00:07:06,818 --> 00:07:10,818
 thou shalt do

74
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:15,13
16 And thou must open thy mouth at all times,

75
00:07:15,13 --> 00:07:19,463
 declaring my gospel with the sound of rejoicing. Amen.

76
00:07:19,463 --> 00:07:23,796
