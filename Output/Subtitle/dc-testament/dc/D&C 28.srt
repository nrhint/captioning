1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:05,875
Section 28 Revelation given through Joseph

2
00:00:05,875 --> 00:00:11,75
Smith the Prophet to Oliver Cowdery, at Fayette,

3
00:00:11,75 --> 00:00:17,625
New York, September 1830. Hiram Page, a member of

4
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:23,5
the Church, had a certain stone and professed

5
00:00:23,5 --> 00:00:29,375
to be receiving revelations by its aid

6
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:35,25
concerning the upbuilding of Zion and the order of the

7
00:00:35,25 --> 00:00:41,125
Church. Several members had been deceived by

8
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:47,0
these claims, and even Oliver Cowdery was wrongly

9
00:00:47,0 --> 00:00:52,875
influenced thereby. Just prior to an appointed

10
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:58,75
conference, the Prophet inquired earnestly of

11
00:00:58,75 --> 00:01:04,625
the Lord concerning the matter, and this

12
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:10,5
revelation followed. 
1–7, Joseph Smith holds the

13
00:01:10,5 --> 00:01:16,375
keys of the mysteries, and only he receives

14
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:22,25
revelations for the Church; 
8–10, Oliver Cowdery is

15
00:01:22,25 --> 00:01:28,125
to preach to the Lamanites; 
11–16, Satan

16
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:34,027
deceived Hiram Page and gave him false revelations. 

17
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:37,227
1 Behold, I say unto thee, Oliver, that it

18
00:01:37,227 --> 00:01:40,427
shall be given unto thee that thou shalt be heard

19
00:01:40,427 --> 00:01:43,627
by the church in all things whatsoever thou

20
00:01:43,627 --> 00:01:46,827
shalt teach them by the Comforter, concerning the

21
00:01:46,827 --> 00:01:50,444
revelations and commandments which I have given.

22
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:56,644
2 But, behold, verily, verily, I say unto

23
00:01:56,644 --> 00:02:02,844
thee, no one shall be appointed to

24
00:02:02,844 --> 00:02:09,044
receive commandments and revelations in this

25
00:02:09,044 --> 00:02:15,244
church excepting my servant Joseph Smith,

26
00:02:15,244 --> 00:02:21,875
Jun., for he receiveth them even as Moses.

27
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:26,475
3 And thou shalt be obedient unto the

28
00:02:26,475 --> 00:02:31,075
things which I shall give unto him,

29
00:02:31,075 --> 00:02:35,675
even as Aaron, to declare faithfully the

30
00:02:35,675 --> 00:02:40,275
commandments and the revelations,

31
00:02:40,275 --> 00:02:44,131
with power and authority unto the church.

32
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:43,881
4 And if thou art led at any time by

33
00:02:43,881 --> 00:02:43,631
the Comforter to speak or teach, or

34
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:43,381
at all times by the way of

35
00:02:43,381 --> 00:02:43,196
commandment unto the church, thou mayest do it.

36
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:44,196
5 But thou shalt not write by

37
00:02:44,196 --> 00:02:45,599
way of commandment, but by wisdom;

38
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:53,599
6 And thou shalt not

39
00:02:53,599 --> 00:03:01,599
command him who is at thy head,

40
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:09,99
and at the head of the church;

41
00:03:09,99 --> 00:03:14,157
7 For I have given him

42
00:03:14,157 --> 00:03:18,324
the keys of the

43
00:03:18,324 --> 00:03:22,491
mysteries, and the revelations

44
00:03:22,491 --> 00:03:26,658
which are sealed,

45
00:03:26,658 --> 00:03:30,825
until I shall appoint unto

46
00:03:30,825 --> 00:03:34,381
them another in his stead.

47
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:34,919
8 And now, behold, I

48
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:35,457
say unto you that you

49
00:03:35,457 --> 00:03:35,995
shall go unto the

50
00:03:35,995 --> 00:03:36,533
Lamanites and preach my

51
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:37,071
gospel unto them;

52
00:03:37,071 --> 00:03:37,609
and inasmuch as they

53
00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:38,147
receive thy teachings

54
00:03:38,147 --> 00:03:38,685
thou shalt cause my

55
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:39,223
church to be

56
00:03:39,223 --> 00:03:39,761
established among them; and

57
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:40,299
thou shalt have

58
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:40,837
revelations, but write them

59
00:03:40,837 --> 00:03:41,421
not by way of commandment.

60
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:42,148
9 And now, behold,

61
00:03:42,148 --> 00:03:42,875
I say unto you that

62
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:43,602
it is not

63
00:03:43,602 --> 00:03:44,329
revealed, and no man

64
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:45,056
knoweth where the city

65
00:03:45,056 --> 00:03:45,783
Zion shall be built,

66
00:03:45,783 --> 00:03:46,51
but it shall be

67
00:03:46,51 --> 00:03:47,237
given hereafter.

68
00:03:47,237 --> 00:03:47,964
Behold, I say unto you

69
00:03:47,964 --> 00:03:48,691
that it shall be on

70
00:03:48,691 --> 00:03:49,863
the borders by the Lamanites.

71
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:50,136
10 Thou shalt not

72
00:03:50,136 --> 00:03:50,409
leave this place

73
00:03:50,409 --> 00:03:50,682
until after the

74
00:03:50,682 --> 00:03:50,955
conference; and

75
00:03:50,955 --> 00:03:51,228
my servant Joseph

76
00:03:51,228 --> 00:03:51,501
shall be

77
00:03:51,501 --> 00:03:51,774
appointed to preside over

78
00:03:51,774 --> 00:03:52,047
the conference

79
00:03:52,047 --> 00:03:52,32
by the voice of

80
00:03:52,32 --> 00:03:52,593
it, and what he

81
00:03:52,593 --> 00:03:52,265
saith to thee thou shalt tell.

82
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:54,015
11 And again,

83
00:03:54,015 --> 00:03:55,765
thou shalt take

84
00:03:55,765 --> 00:03:57,515
thy brother, Hiram

85
00:03:57,515 --> 00:03:59,265
Page, between

86
00:03:59,265 --> 00:04:01,015
him and thee

87
00:04:01,015 --> 00:04:02,765
alone, and tell him

88
00:04:02,765 --> 00:04:04,515
that those

89
00:04:04,515 --> 00:04:06,265
things which he hath

90
00:04:06,265 --> 00:04:08,015
written from

91
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:09,765
that stone are not

92
00:04:09,765 --> 00:04:11,515
of me and that

93
00:04:11,515 --> 00:04:13,62
Satan deceiveth him;

94
00:04:13,62 --> 00:04:14,22
12 For, behold,

95
00:04:14,22 --> 00:04:14,82
these things

96
00:04:14,82 --> 00:04:15,42
have not been

97
00:04:15,42 --> 00:04:16,02
appointed unto

98
00:04:16,02 --> 00:04:16,62
him, neither

99
00:04:16,62 --> 00:04:17,22
shall anything be

100
00:04:17,22 --> 00:04:17,82
appointed unto

101
00:04:17,82 --> 00:04:18,42
any of this

102
00:04:18,42 --> 00:04:19,02
church contrary to

103
00:04:19,02 --> 00:04:19,493
the church covenants.

104
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:22,064
13 For all

105
00:04:22,064 --> 00:04:24,635
things must be

106
00:04:24,635 --> 00:04:27,206
done in order,

107
00:04:27,206 --> 00:04:29,777
and by common

108
00:04:29,777 --> 00:04:32,348
consent in the

109
00:04:32,348 --> 00:04:34,919
church, by the

110
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:37,844
prayer of faith.

111
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:38,117
14 And thou

112
00:04:38,117 --> 00:04:38,39
shalt assist

113
00:04:38,39 --> 00:04:38,663
to settle all

114
00:04:38,663 --> 00:04:38,936
these things,

115
00:04:38,936 --> 00:04:39,209
according to

116
00:04:39,209 --> 00:04:39,482
the

117
00:04:39,482 --> 00:04:39,755
covenants of the

118
00:04:39,755 --> 00:04:40,028
church, before

119
00:04:40,028 --> 00:04:40,301
thou shalt take

120
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:40,574
thy journey

121
00:04:40,574 --> 00:04:40,247
among the Lamanites.

122
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:41,803
15 And it

123
00:04:41,803 --> 00:04:43,359
shall be given

124
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:44,915
thee from

125
00:04:44,915 --> 00:04:46,471
the time thou

126
00:04:46,471 --> 00:04:48,027
shalt go,

127
00:04:48,027 --> 00:04:49,583
until the

128
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,139
time thou shalt

129
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:52,695
return,

130
00:04:52,695 --> 00:04:54,528
what thou shalt do.

131
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:55,639
16 And thou

132
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:56,75
must open

133
00:04:56,75 --> 00:04:57,861
thy mouth

134
00:04:57,861 --> 00:04:58,972
at all

135
00:04:58,972 --> 00:05:00,083
times, declaring

136
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,194
my gospel

137
00:05:01,194 --> 00:05:02,305
with the

138
00:05:02,305 --> 00:05:03,416
sound of

139
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:04,871
rejoicing. Amen.
