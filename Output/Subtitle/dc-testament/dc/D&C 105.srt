1
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:19,468
Section 105 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:19,468 --> 00:00:27,425
 the Prophet, on Fishing River, Missouri, June 22,

3
00:00:27,425 --> 00:00:35,383
 1834. Under the leadership of the Prophet, Saints

4
00:00:35,383 --> 00:00:43,34
 from Ohio and other areas marched to Missouri in

5
00:00:43,34 --> 00:00:51,296
 an expedition later known as Zion’s Camp. Their

6
00:00:51,296 --> 00:00:59,253
 purpose was to escort the expelled Missouri Saints

7
00:00:59,253 --> 00:01:07,21
 back to their lands in Jackson County. Missourians

8
00:01:07,21 --> 00:01:15,168
 who had previously persecuted the Saints feared

9
00:01:15,168 --> 00:01:23,124
 retaliation from Zion’s Camp and preemptively

10
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:31,081
 attacked some Saints living in Clay County, Missouri.

11
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:39,038
 After the Missouri governor withdrew his promise to

12
00:01:39,038 --> 00:01:46,995
 support the Saints, Joseph Smith received this

13
00:01:46,995 --> 00:01:54,953
 revelation. 
1–5, Zion will be built up by conformity

14
00:01:54,953 --> 00:02:02,909
 to celestial law; 
6–13, The redemption of Zion is

15
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:10,867
 deferred for a little season; 
14–19, The Lord

16
00:02:10,867 --> 00:02:18,823
 will fight the battles of Zion; 
20–26, The Saints

17
00:02:18,823 --> 00:02:26,781
 are to be wise and not boast of mighty works as

18
00:02:26,781 --> 00:02:34,738
 they gather; 
27–30, Lands in Jackson and adjoining

19
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:42,695
 counties should be purchased; 
31–34, The elders

20
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:50,651
 are to receive an endowment in the house of the Lord

21
00:02:50,651 --> 00:02:58,609
 in Kirtland; 
35–37, Saints who are both called

22
00:02:58,609 --> 00:03:06,566
 and chosen will be sanctified; 
38–41, The Saints

23
00:03:06,566 --> 00:03:14,523
 are to lift an ensign of peace to the world.

24
00:03:14,578 --> 00:03:20,245
1 Verily I say unto you who have assembled

25
00:03:20,245 --> 00:03:25,912
 yourselves together that you may learn my will concerning

26
00:03:25,912 --> 00:03:31,579
 the redemption of mine afflicted people

27
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:37,378
2 Behold, I say unto you, were it not for the

28
00:03:37,378 --> 00:03:42,878
 transgressions of my people, speaking concerning the

29
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:48,378
 church and not individuals, they might have been

30
00:03:48,378 --> 00:03:53,878
 redeemed even now

31
00:03:53,166 --> 00:04:00,966
3 But behold, they have not learned to be obedient

32
00:04:00,966 --> 00:04:08,766
 to the things which I required at their hands,

33
00:04:08,766 --> 00:04:16,566
 but are full of all manner of evil, and do not

34
00:04:16,566 --> 00:04:24,366
 impart of their substance, as becometh saints, to the

35
00:04:24,366 --> 00:04:32,166
 poor and afflicted among them

36
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,139
4 And are not united according to the union

37
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:41,639
 required by the law of the celestial kingdom

38
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:46,514
5 And Zion cannot be built up unless it is by the

39
00:04:46,514 --> 00:04:51,847
 principles of the law of the celestial kingdom;

40
00:04:51,847 --> 00:04:57,18
 otherwise I cannot receive her unto myself

41
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:02,964
6 And my people must needs be chastened until they

42
00:05:02,964 --> 00:05:07,964
 learn obedience, if it must needs be, by the

43
00:05:07,964 --> 00:05:12,964
 things which they suffer

44
00:05:12,963 --> 00:05:17,213
7 I speak not concerning those who are appointed

45
00:05:17,213 --> 00:05:21,463
 to lead my people, who are the first elders of my

46
00:05:21,463 --> 00:05:25,713
 church, for they are not all under this

47
00:05:25,713 --> 00:05:29,963
 condemnation

48
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:35,062
8 But I speak concerning my churches abroad—there

49
00:05:35,062 --> 00:05:40,862
 are many who will say: Where is their God? Behold,

50
00:05:40,862 --> 00:05:46,662
 he will deliver them in time of trouble,

51
00:05:46,662 --> 00:05:52,462
 otherwise we will not go up unto Zion, and will keep our

52
00:05:52,462 --> 00:05:58,262
 moneys

53
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:02,775
9 Therefore, in consequence of the transgressions

54
00:06:02,775 --> 00:06:07,025
 of my people, it is expedient in me that mine

55
00:06:07,025 --> 00:06:11,275
 elders should wait for a little season for the

56
00:06:11,275 --> 00:06:15,525
 redemption of Zion

57
00:06:15,325 --> 00:06:18,925
10 That they themselves may be prepared, and that

58
00:06:18,925 --> 00:06:22,525
 my people may be taught more perfectly, and have

59
00:06:22,525 --> 00:06:26,125
 experience, and know more perfectly concerning

60
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:29,725
 their duty, and the things which I require at their

61
00:06:29,725 --> 00:06:33,325
 hands

62
00:06:33,61 --> 00:06:40,11
11 And this cannot be brought to pass until mine

63
00:06:40,11 --> 00:06:46,61
 elders are endowed with power from on high

64
00:06:46,89 --> 00:06:50,64
12 For behold, I have prepared a great endowment

65
00:06:50,64 --> 00:06:54,39
 and blessing to be poured out upon them, inasmuch

66
00:06:54,39 --> 00:06:58,14
 as they are faithful and continue in humility

67
00:06:58,14 --> 00:07:01,89
 before me

68
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:06,355
13 Therefore it is expedient in me that mine

69
00:07:06,355 --> 00:07:11,022
 elders should wait for a little season, for the

70
00:07:11,022 --> 00:07:15,689
 redemption of Zion

71
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:21,969
14 For behold, I do not require at their hands to

72
00:07:21,969 --> 00:07:27,969
 fight the battles of Zion; for, as I said in a

73
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:33,969
 former commandment, even so will I fulfil—I will

74
00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:39,969
 fight your battles

75
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:46,058
15 Behold, the destroyer I have sent forth to

76
00:07:46,058 --> 00:07:52,891
 destroy and lay waste mine enemies; and not many years

77
00:07:52,891 --> 00:07:59,724
 hence they shall not be left to pollute mine

78
00:07:59,724 --> 00:08:06,557
 heritage, and to blaspheme my name upon the lands

79
00:08:06,557 --> 00:08:13,39
 which I have consecrated for the gathering together of

80
00:08:13,39 --> 00:08:20,223
 my saints

81
00:08:20,216 --> 00:08:27,049
16 Behold, I have commanded my servant Joseph

82
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:33,882
 Smith, Jun., to say unto the strength of my house,

83
00:08:33,882 --> 00:08:40,715
 even my warriors, my young men, and middle-aged, to

84
00:08:40,715 --> 00:08:47,548
 gather together for the redemption of my people,

85
00:08:47,548 --> 00:08:54,381
 and throw down the towers of mine enemies, and

86
00:08:54,381 --> 00:09:01,214
 scatter their watchmen

87
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:05,207
17 But the strength of mine house have not

88
00:09:05,207 --> 00:09:09,207
 hearkened unto my words

89
00:09:09,766 --> 00:09:15,766
18 But inasmuch as there are those who have

90
00:09:15,766 --> 00:09:21,766
 hearkened unto my words, I have prepared a blessing and

91
00:09:21,766 --> 00:09:27,766
 an endowment for them, if they continue faithful

92
00:09:27,55 --> 00:09:32,3
19 I have heard their prayers, and will accept

93
00:09:32,3 --> 00:09:37,05
 their offering; and it is expedient in me that they

94
00:09:37,05 --> 00:09:41,8
 should be brought thus far for a trial of their

95
00:09:41,8 --> 00:09:46,55
 faith

96
00:09:46,069 --> 00:09:50,069
20 And now, verily I say unto you, a commandment I

97
00:09:50,069 --> 00:09:54,069
 give unto you, that as many as have come up

98
00:09:54,069 --> 00:09:58,069
 hither, that can stay in the region round about, let

99
00:09:58,069 --> 00:10:02,069
 them stay

100
00:10:02,051 --> 00:10:06,301
21 And those that cannot stay, who have families

101
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:10,551
 in the east, let them tarry for a little season,

102
00:10:10,551 --> 00:10:14,801
 inasmuch as my servant Joseph shall appoint unto

103
00:10:14,801 --> 00:10:19,051
 them

104
00:10:19,569 --> 00:10:23,569
22 For I will counsel him concerning this matter,

105
00:10:23,569 --> 00:10:27,569
 and all things whatsoever he shall appoint unto

106
00:10:27,569 --> 00:10:31,569
 them shall be fulfilled

107
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:36,865
23 And let all my people who dwell in the regions

108
00:10:36,865 --> 00:10:41,865
 round about be very faithful, and prayerful, and

109
00:10:41,865 --> 00:10:46,865
 humble before me, and reveal not the things which I

110
00:10:46,865 --> 00:10:51,865
 have revealed unto them, until it is wisdom in me

111
00:10:51,865 --> 00:10:56,865
 that they should be revealed

112
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:03,639
24 Talk not of judgments, neither boast of faith

113
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:10,639
 nor of mighty works, but carefully gather together,

114
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:17,639
 as much in one region as can be, consistently

115
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:24,639
 with the feelings of the people

116
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:32,984
25 And behold, I will give unto you favor and

117
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:41,584
 grace in their eyes, that you may rest in peace and

118
00:11:41,584 --> 00:11:50,184
 safety, while you are saying unto the people:

119
00:11:50,184 --> 00:11:58,784
 Execute judgment and justice for us according to law,

120
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:07,384
 and redress us of our wrongs

121
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:14,627
26 Now, behold, I say unto you, my friends, in

122
00:12:14,627 --> 00:12:21,627
 this way you may find favor in the eyes of the

123
00:12:21,627 --> 00:12:28,627
 people, until the army of Israel becomes very great

124
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:36,614
27 And I will soften the hearts of the people, as

125
00:12:36,614 --> 00:12:44,814
 I did the heart of Pharaoh, from time to time,

126
00:12:44,814 --> 00:12:53,014
 until my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and mine elders,

127
00:12:53,014 --> 00:13:01,214
 whom I have appointed, shall have time to gather

128
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:09,414
 up the strength of my house

129
00:13:09,172 --> 00:13:15,672
28 And to have sent wise men, to fulfil that which

130
00:13:15,672 --> 00:13:22,172
 I have commanded concerning the purchasing of all

131
00:13:22,172 --> 00:13:28,672
 the lands in Jackson county that can be

132
00:13:28,672 --> 00:13:35,172
 purchased, and in the adjoining counties round about

133
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:40,231
29 For it is my will that these lands should be

134
00:13:40,231 --> 00:13:44,981
 purchased; and after they are purchased that my

135
00:13:44,981 --> 00:13:49,731
 saints should possess them according to the laws of

136
00:13:49,731 --> 00:13:54,481
 consecration which I have given

137
00:13:54,484 --> 00:13:59,359
30 And after these lands are purchased, I will

138
00:13:59,359 --> 00:14:04,234
 hold the armies of Israel guiltless in taking

139
00:14:04,234 --> 00:14:09,109
 possession of their own lands, which they have previously

140
00:14:09,109 --> 00:14:13,984
 purchased with their moneys, and of throwing down

141
00:14:13,984 --> 00:14:18,859
 the towers of mine enemies that may be upon them,

142
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:23,734
 and scattering their watchmen, and avenging me of

143
00:14:23,734 --> 00:14:28,609
 mine enemies unto the third and fourth generation

144
00:14:28,609 --> 00:14:33,484
 of them that hate me

145
00:14:33,723 --> 00:14:40,473
31 But first let my army become very great, and

146
00:14:40,473 --> 00:14:47,223
 let it be sanctified before me, that it may become

147
00:14:47,223 --> 00:14:53,973
 fair as the sun, and clear as the moon, and that

148
00:14:53,973 --> 00:15:00,723
 her banners may be terrible unto all nations

149
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:06,733
32 That the kingdoms of this world may be

150
00:15:06,733 --> 00:15:13,233
 constrained to acknowledge that the kingdom of Zion is in

151
00:15:13,233 --> 00:15:19,733
 very deed the kingdom of our God and his Christ;

152
00:15:19,733 --> 00:15:26,233
 therefore, let us become subject unto her laws

153
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:30,659
33 Verily I say unto you, it is expedient in me

154
00:15:30,659 --> 00:15:35,059
 that the first elders of my church should receive

155
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:39,459
 their endowment from on high in my house, which I

156
00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:43,859
 have commanded to be built unto my name in the land

157
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:48,259
 of Kirtland

158
00:15:48,764 --> 00:15:55,097
34 And let those commandments which I have given

159
00:15:55,097 --> 00:16:01,43
 concerning Zion and her law be executed and

160
00:16:01,43 --> 00:16:07,763
 fulfilled, after her redemption

161
00:16:07,283 --> 00:16:12,283
35 There has been a day of calling, but the time

162
00:16:12,283 --> 00:16:17,283
 has come for a day of choosing; and let those be

163
00:16:17,283 --> 00:16:22,283
 chosen that are worthy

164
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:25,614
36 And it shall be manifest unto my servant, by

165
00:16:25,614 --> 00:16:28,947
 the voice of the Spirit, those that are chosen; and

166
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:32,28
 they shall be sanctified

167
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:38,908
37 And inasmuch as they follow the counsel which

168
00:16:38,908 --> 00:16:45,241
 they receive, they shall have power after many days

169
00:16:45,241 --> 00:16:51,574
 to accomplish all things pertaining to Zion

170
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:57,577
38 And again I say unto you, sue for peace, not

171
00:16:57,577 --> 00:17:03,577
 only to the people that have smitten you, but also

172
00:17:03,577 --> 00:17:09,577
 to all people

173
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:14,862
39 And lift up an ensign of peace, and make a

174
00:17:14,862 --> 00:17:19,862
 proclamation of peace unto the ends of the earth

175
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:23,155
40 And make proposals for peace unto those who

176
00:17:23,155 --> 00:17:26,905
 have smitten you, according to the voice of the

177
00:17:26,905 --> 00:17:30,655
 Spirit which is in you, and all things shall work

178
00:17:30,655 --> 00:17:34,405
 together for your good

179
00:17:34,17 --> 00:17:38,17
41 Therefore, be faithful; and behold, and lo, I

180
00:17:38,17 --> 00:17:42,17
 am with you even unto the end. Even so. Amen.
