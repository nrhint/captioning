00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 105 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Prophet, on Fishing River, Missouri, June

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
22, 1834. Under the leadership of the Prophet,

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Saints from Ohio and other areas marched to Missouri

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
in an expedition later known as Zion’s Camp.

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Their purpose was to escort the expelled Missouri

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Saints back to their lands in Jackson County.

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Missourians who had previously persecuted the Saints

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
feared retaliation from Zion’s Camp and

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
preemptively attacked some Saints living in Clay County,

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Missouri. After the Missouri governor withdrew his

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
promise to support the Saints, Joseph Smith

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
received this revelation. 
1–5, Zion will be built up

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
by conformity to celestial law; 
6–13, The

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
redemption of Zion is deferred for a little season;

16
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
14–19, The Lord will fight the battles of Zion;

17
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
20–26, The Saints are to be wise and not boast of

18
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
mighty works as they gather; 
27–30, Lands in

19
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Jackson and adjoining counties should be purchased;

20
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
31–34, The elders are to receive an endowment in

21
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the house of the Lord in Kirtland; 
35–37, Saints

22
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
who are both called and chosen will be

23
00:00:00,0 --> 03:13:40,
sanctified; 
38–41, The Saints are to lift an ensign of peace to the world. 

24
03:13:40,0 --> 03:13:40,0
1 Verily I say unto you who have assembled

25
03:13:40,0 --> 03:13:40,0
yourselves together that you may learn my will

26
03:13:40,0 --> 03:30:42,
concerning the redemption of mine afflicted people—

27
03:30:42,0 --> 03:30:42,0
2 Behold, I say unto you, were it not for

28
03:30:42,0 --> 03:30:42,0
the transgressions of my people,

29
03:30:42,0 --> 03:30:42,0
speaking concerning the church and not

30
03:30:42,0 --> 03:55:43,
individuals, they might have been redeemed even now.

31
03:55:43,0 --> 03:55:43,0
3 But behold, they have not learned to

32
03:55:43,0 --> 03:55:43,0
be obedient to the things which I

33
03:55:43,0 --> 03:55:43,0
required at their hands, but are full of

34
03:55:43,0 --> 03:55:43,0
all manner of evil, and do not impart

35
03:55:43,0 --> 03:55:43,0
of their substance, as becometh

36
03:55:43,0 --> 04:18:44,
saints, to the poor and afflicted among them;

37
04:18:44,0 --> 04:18:44,0
4 And are not united

38
04:18:44,0 --> 04:18:44,0
according to the union required by

39
04:18:44,0 --> 04:31:48,
the law of the celestial kingdom;

40
04:31:48,0 --> 04:31:48,0
5 And Zion cannot be built

41
04:31:48,0 --> 04:31:48,0
up unless it is by the

42
04:31:48,0 --> 04:31:48,0
principles of the law of the

43
04:31:48,0 --> 04:31:48,0
celestial kingdom; otherwise I

44
04:31:48,0 --> 04:35:26,
cannot receive her unto myself.

45
04:35:26,0 --> 04:35:26,0
6 And my people must

46
04:35:26,0 --> 04:35:26,0
needs be chastened until

47
04:35:26,0 --> 04:35:26,0
they learn obedience, if

48
04:35:26,0 --> 04:35:26,0
it must needs be, by the

49
04:35:26,0 --> 04:40:31,
things which they suffer.

50
04:40:31,0 --> 04:40:31,0
7 I speak not

51
04:40:31,0 --> 04:40:31,0
concerning those who are

52
04:40:31,0 --> 04:40:31,0
appointed to lead my

53
04:40:31,0 --> 04:40:31,0
people, who are the

54
04:40:31,0 --> 04:40:31,0
first elders of my

55
04:40:31,0 --> 04:40:31,0
church, for they are not

56
04:40:31,0 --> 04:55:33,
all under this condemnation;

57
04:55:33,0 --> 04:55:33,0
8 But I speak

58
04:55:33,0 --> 04:55:33,0
concerning my churches

59
04:55:33,0 --> 04:55:33,0
abroad—there are many

60
04:55:33,0 --> 04:55:33,0
who will say: Where

61
04:55:33,0 --> 04:55:33,0
is their God? Behold,

62
04:55:33,0 --> 04:55:33,0
he will deliver

63
04:55:33,0 --> 04:55:33,0
them in time of

64
04:55:33,0 --> 04:55:33,0
trouble, otherwise we will

65
04:55:33,0 --> 04:55:33,0
not go up unto Zion,

66
04:55:33,0 --> 04:56:37,
and will keep our moneys.

67
04:56:37,0 --> 04:56:37,0
9 Therefore, in

68
04:56:37,0 --> 04:56:37,0
consequence of the

69
04:56:37,0 --> 04:56:37,0
transgressions of

70
04:56:37,0 --> 04:56:37,0
my people, it is

71
04:56:37,0 --> 04:56:37,0
expedient in me that

72
04:56:37,0 --> 04:56:37,0
mine elders

73
04:56:37,0 --> 04:56:37,0
should wait for a

74
04:56:37,0 --> 04:56:37,0
little season for the

75
04:56:37,0 --> 05:10:41,
redemption of Zion—

76
05:10:41,0 --> 05:10:41,0
10 That they

77
05:10:41,0 --> 05:10:41,0
themselves may be

78
05:10:41,0 --> 05:10:41,0
prepared, and that

79
05:10:41,0 --> 05:10:41,0
my people may be

80
05:10:41,0 --> 05:10:41,0
taught more

81
05:10:41,0 --> 05:10:41,0
perfectly, and have

82
05:10:41,0 --> 05:10:41,0
experience, and know

83
05:10:41,0 --> 05:10:41,0
more perfectly

84
05:10:41,0 --> 05:10:41,0
concerning their

85
05:10:41,0 --> 05:10:41,0
duty, and the

86
05:10:41,0 --> 05:10:41,0
things which I

87
05:10:41,0 --> 05:06:21,
require at their hands.

88
05:06:21,0 --> 05:06:21,0
11 And this

89
05:06:21,0 --> 05:06:21,0
cannot be brought

90
05:06:21,0 --> 05:06:21,0
to pass until

91
05:06:21,0 --> 05:06:21,0
mine elders are

92
05:06:21,0 --> 05:06:21,0
endowed with

93
05:06:21,0 --> 05:08:25,
power from on high.

94
05:08:25,0 --> 05:08:25,0
12 For behold,

95
05:08:25,0 --> 05:08:25,0
I have

96
05:08:25,0 --> 05:08:25,0
prepared a great

97
05:08:25,0 --> 05:08:25,0
endowment and

98
05:08:25,0 --> 05:08:25,0
blessing to be

99
05:08:25,0 --> 05:08:25,0
poured out upon

100
05:08:25,0 --> 05:08:25,0
them, inasmuch

101
05:08:25,0 --> 05:08:25,0
as they are

102
05:08:25,0 --> 05:08:25,0
faithful and

103
05:08:25,0 --> 05:08:25,0
continue in

104
05:08:25,0 --> 05:12:04,
humility before me.

105
05:12:04,0 --> 05:12:04,0
13 Therefore

106
05:12:04,0 --> 05:12:04,0
it is expedient

107
05:12:04,0 --> 05:12:04,0
in me that

108
05:12:04,0 --> 05:12:04,0
mine elders

109
05:12:04,0 --> 05:12:04,0
should wait for a

110
05:12:04,0 --> 05:12:04,0
little season,

111
05:12:04,0 --> 05:12:04,0
for the

112
05:12:04,0 --> 05:27:06,
redemption of Zion.

113
05:27:06,0 --> 05:27:06,0
14 For

114
05:27:06,0 --> 05:27:06,0
behold, I do not

115
05:27:06,0 --> 05:27:06,0
require at

116
05:27:06,0 --> 05:27:06,0
their hands to

117
05:27:06,0 --> 05:27:06,0
fight the

118
05:27:06,0 --> 05:27:06,0
battles of Zion;

119
05:27:06,0 --> 05:27:06,0
for, as I said

120
05:27:06,0 --> 05:27:06,0
in a former

121
05:27:06,0 --> 05:27:06,0
commandment,

122
05:27:06,0 --> 05:27:06,0
even so will

123
05:27:06,0 --> 05:27:06,0
I fulfil—I

124
05:27:06,0 --> 05:28:10,
will fight your battles.

125
05:28:10,0 --> 05:28:10,0
15 Behold,

126
05:28:10,0 --> 05:28:10,0
the destroyer

127
05:28:10,0 --> 05:28:10,0
I have sent

128
05:28:10,0 --> 05:28:10,0
forth to

129
05:28:10,0 --> 05:28:10,0
destroy and

130
05:28:10,0 --> 05:28:10,0
lay waste mine

131
05:28:10,0 --> 05:28:10,0
enemies;

132
05:28:10,0 --> 05:28:10,0
and not many

133
05:28:10,0 --> 05:28:10,0
years hence

134
05:28:10,0 --> 05:28:10,0
they shall

135
05:28:10,0 --> 05:28:10,0
not be left to

136
05:28:10,0 --> 05:28:10,0
pollute

137
05:28:10,0 --> 05:28:10,0
mine heritage,

138
05:28:10,0 --> 05:28:10,0
and to

139
05:28:10,0 --> 05:28:10,0
blaspheme my name

140
05:28:10,0 --> 05:28:10,0
upon the

141
05:28:10,0 --> 05:28:10,0
lands which I

142
05:28:10,0 --> 05:28:10,0
have

143
05:28:10,0 --> 05:28:10,0
consecrated for the

144
05:28:10,0 --> 05:28:10,0
gathering

145
05:28:10,0 --> 05:57:12,
together of my saints.

146
05:57:12,0 --> 05:57:12,0
16 Behold,

147
05:57:12,0 --> 05:57:12,0
I have

148
05:57:12,0 --> 05:57:12,0
commanded my

149
05:57:12,0 --> 05:57:12,0
servant

150
05:57:12,0 --> 05:57:12,0
Joseph Smith,

151
05:57:12,0 --> 05:57:12,0
Jun., to say

152
05:57:12,0 --> 05:57:12,0
unto the

153
05:57:12,0 --> 05:57:12,0
strength of

154
05:57:12,0 --> 05:57:12,0
my house,

155
05:57:12,0 --> 05:57:12,0
even my

156
05:57:12,0 --> 05:57:12,0
warriors, my

157
05:57:12,0 --> 05:57:12,0
young men, and

158
05:57:12,0 --> 05:57:12,0


159
05:57:12,0 --> 05:57:12,0
middle-aged, to

160
05:57:12,0 --> 05:57:12,0
gather together

161
05:57:12,0 --> 05:57:12,0
for the

162
05:57:12,0 --> 05:57:12,0
redemption of

163
05:57:12,0 --> 05:57:12,0
my people,

164
05:57:12,0 --> 05:57:12,0
and throw

165
05:57:12,0 --> 05:57:12,0
down the

166
05:57:12,0 --> 05:57:12,0
towers of mine

167
05:57:12,0 --> 05:57:12,0
enemies,

168
05:57:12,0 --> 06:14:14,
and scatter their watchmen;

169
06:14:14,0 --> 06:14:14,0
17 But

170
06:14:14,0 --> 06:14:14,0
the

171
06:14:14,0 --> 06:14:14,0
strength of mine

172
06:14:14,0 --> 06:14:14,0
house

173
06:14:14,0 --> 06:14:14,0
have not

174
06:14:14,0 --> 06:14:14,0
hearkened

175
06:14:14,0 --> 06:32:16,
unto my words.

176
06:32:16,0 --> 06:32:16,0
18 But

177
06:32:16,0 --> 06:32:16,0
inasmuch

178
06:32:16,0 --> 06:32:16,0
as there

179
06:32:16,0 --> 06:32:16,0
are

180
06:32:16,0 --> 06:32:16,0
those who

181
06:32:16,0 --> 06:32:16,0
have

182
06:32:16,0 --> 06:32:16,0
hearkened

183
06:32:16,0 --> 06:32:16,0
unto my

184
06:32:16,0 --> 06:32:16,0
words, I

185
06:32:16,0 --> 06:32:16,0
have

186
06:32:16,0 --> 06:32:16,0
prepared a

187
06:32:16,0 --> 06:32:16,0
blessing

188
06:32:16,0 --> 06:32:16,0
and an

189
06:32:16,0 --> 06:32:16,0
endowment

190
06:32:16,0 --> 06:32:16,0
for

191
06:32:16,0 --> 06:32:16,0
them, if

192
06:32:16,0 --> 06:45:20,
they continue faithful.

193
06:45:20,0 --> 06:45:20,0
19 I

194
06:45:20,0 --> 06:45:20,0
have

195
06:45:20,0 --> 06:45:20,0
heard their

196
06:45:20,0 --> 06:45:20,0


197
06:45:20,0 --> 06:45:20,0
prayers, and

198
06:45:20,0 --> 06:45:20,0
will

199
06:45:20,0 --> 06:45:20,0
accept

200
06:45:20,0 --> 06:45:20,0
their

201
06:45:20,0 --> 06:45:20,0
offering;

202
06:45:20,0 --> 06:45:20,0
and it

203
06:45:20,0 --> 06:45:20,0
is

204
06:45:20,0 --> 06:45:20,0
expedient

205
06:45:20,0 --> 06:45:20,0
in me

206
06:45:20,0 --> 06:45:20,0
that they

207
06:45:20,0 --> 06:45:20,0
should

208
06:45:20,0 --> 06:45:20,0
be

209
06:45:20,0 --> 06:45:20,0
brought

210
06:45:20,0 --> 06:45:20,0
thus far

211
06:45:20,0 --> 06:45:20,0
for a

212
06:45:20,0 --> 07:00:22,
trial of their faith.

213
07:00:22,0 --> 07:00:22,0
20 And

214
07:00:22,0 --> 07:00:22,0
now,

215
07:00:22,0 --> 07:00:22,0
verily

216
07:00:22,0 --> 07:00:22,0
I say

217
07:00:22,0 --> 07:00:22,0
unto

218
07:00:22,0 --> 07:00:22,0
you, a

219
07:00:22,0 --> 07:00:22,0


220
07:00:22,0 --> 07:00:22,0
commandment

221
07:00:22,0 --> 07:00:22,0
I

222
07:00:22,0 --> 07:00:22,0
