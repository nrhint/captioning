00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:19,043
Section 97 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:19,043 --> 00:00:26,808
 the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, August 2, 1833.

3
00:00:26,808 --> 00:00:34,573
 This revelation deals particularly with the affairs

4
00:00:34,573 --> 00:00:42,338
 of the Saints in Zion, Jackson County, Missouri, in

5
00:00:42,338 --> 00:00:50,103
 response to the Prophet’s inquiry of the Lord for

6
00:00:50,103 --> 00:00:57,868
 information. Members of the Church in Missouri

7
00:00:57,868 --> 00:01:05,633
 were at this time subjected to severe persecution

8
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:13,398
 and, on July 23, 1833, had been forced to sign an

9
00:01:13,398 --> 00:01:21,163
 agreement to leave Jackson County. 
1–2, Many of the

10
00:01:21,163 --> 00:01:28,928
 Saints in Zion (Jackson County, Missouri) are

11
00:01:28,928 --> 00:01:36,693
 blessed for their faithfulness; 
3–5, Parley P. Pratt

12
00:01:36,693 --> 00:01:44,458
 is commended for his labors in the school in

13
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:52,223
 Zion; 
6–9, Those who observe their covenants are

14
00:01:52,223 --> 00:01:59,988
 accepted by the Lord; 
10–17, A house is to be built

15
00:01:59,988 --> 00:02:07,753
 in Zion in which the pure in heart will see God;

16
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:15,518
18–21, Zion is the pure in heart; 
22–28, Zion will

17
00:02:15,518 --> 00:02:23,283
 escape the Lord’s scourge if she is faithful.

18
00:02:23,36 --> 00:02:28,193
1 Verily I say unto you my friends, I speak unto

19
00:02:28,193 --> 00:02:33,026
 you with my voice, even the voice of my Spirit,

20
00:02:33,026 --> 00:02:37,859
 that I may show unto you my will concerning your

21
00:02:37,859 --> 00:02:42,692
 brethren in the land of Zion, many of whom are truly

22
00:02:42,692 --> 00:02:47,525
 humble and are seeking diligently to learn wisdom

23
00:02:47,525 --> 00:02:52,358
 and to find truth

24
00:02:52,356 --> 00:02:57,556
2 Verily, verily I say unto you, blessed are such,

25
00:02:57,556 --> 00:03:02,756
 for they shall obtain; for I, the Lord, show

26
00:03:02,756 --> 00:03:07,956
 mercy unto all the meek, and upon all whomsoever I

27
00:03:07,956 --> 00:03:13,156
 will, that I may be justified when I shall bring them

28
00:03:13,156 --> 00:03:18,356
 unto judgment

29
00:03:18,648 --> 00:03:23,398
3 Behold, I say unto you, concerning the school in

30
00:03:23,398 --> 00:03:28,148
 Zion, I, the Lord, am well pleased that there

31
00:03:28,148 --> 00:03:32,898
 should be a school in Zion, and also with my servant

32
00:03:32,898 --> 00:03:37,648
 Parley P. Pratt, for he abideth in me

33
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:40,901
4 And inasmuch as he continueth to abide in me he

34
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:44,151
 shall continue to preside over the school in the

35
00:03:44,151 --> 00:03:47,401
 land of Zion until I shall give unto him other

36
00:03:47,401 --> 00:03:50,651
 commandments

37
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:56,681
5 And I will bless him with a multiplicity of

38
00:03:56,681 --> 00:04:02,431
 blessings, in expounding all scriptures and mysteries

39
00:04:02,431 --> 00:04:08,181
 to the edification of the school, and of the

40
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:13,931
 church in Zion

41
00:04:13,92 --> 00:04:17,92
6 And to the residue of the school, I, the Lord,

42
00:04:17,92 --> 00:04:21,92
 am willing to show mercy; nevertheless, there are

43
00:04:21,92 --> 00:04:25,92
 those that must needs be chastened, and their works

44
00:04:25,92 --> 00:04:29,92
 shall be made known

45
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:35,653
7 The ax is laid at the root of the trees; and

46
00:04:35,653 --> 00:04:41,403
 every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit shall

47
00:04:41,403 --> 00:04:47,153
 be hewn down and cast into the fire. I, the Lord,

48
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:52,903
 have spoken it

49
00:04:52,175 --> 00:04:57,008
8 Verily I say unto you, all among them who know

50
00:04:57,008 --> 00:05:01,841
 their hearts are honest, and are broken, and their

51
00:05:01,841 --> 00:05:06,674
 spirits contrite, and are willing to observe their

52
00:05:06,674 --> 00:05:11,507
 covenants by sacrifice—yea, every sacrifice which

53
00:05:11,507 --> 00:05:16,34
 I, the Lord, shall command—they are accepted of

54
00:05:16,34 --> 00:05:21,173
 me

55
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:27,688
9 For I, the Lord, will cause them to bring forth

56
00:05:27,688 --> 00:05:33,688
 as a very fruitful tree which is planted in a

57
00:05:33,688 --> 00:05:39,688
 goodly land, by a pure stream, that yieldeth much

58
00:05:39,688 --> 00:05:45,688
 precious fruit

59
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:51,312
10 Verily I say unto you, that it is my will that

60
00:05:51,312 --> 00:05:56,645
 a house should be built unto me in the land of

61
00:05:56,645 --> 00:06:01,978
 Zion, like unto the pattern which I have given you

62
00:06:01,244 --> 00:06:05,244
11 Yea, let it be built speedily, by the tithing

63
00:06:05,244 --> 00:06:09,244
 of my people

64
00:06:09,553 --> 00:06:13,553
12 Behold, this is the tithing and the sacrifice

65
00:06:13,553 --> 00:06:17,553
 which I, the Lord, require at their hands, that

66
00:06:17,553 --> 00:06:21,553
 there may be a house built unto me for the salvation

67
00:06:21,553 --> 00:06:25,553
 of Zion

68
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:30,551
13 For a place of thanksgiving for all saints, and

69
00:06:30,551 --> 00:06:36,051
 for a place of instruction for all those who are

70
00:06:36,051 --> 00:06:41,551
 called to the work of the ministry in all their

71
00:06:41,551 --> 00:06:47,051
 several callings and offices

72
00:06:47,04 --> 00:06:51,04
14 That they may be perfected in the understanding

73
00:06:51,04 --> 00:06:55,04
 of their ministry, in theory, in principle, and

74
00:06:55,04 --> 00:06:59,04
 in doctrine, in all things pertaining to the

75
00:06:59,04 --> 00:07:03,04
 kingdom of God on the earth, the keys of which kingdom

76
00:07:03,04 --> 00:07:07,04
 have been conferred upon you

77
00:07:07,811 --> 00:07:13,061
15 And inasmuch as my people build a house unto me

78
00:07:13,061 --> 00:07:18,311
 in the name of the Lord, and do not suffer any

79
00:07:18,311 --> 00:07:23,561
 unclean thing to come into it, that it be not

80
00:07:23,561 --> 00:07:28,811
 defiled, my glory shall rest upon it

81
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:33,515
16 Yea, and my presence shall be there, for I will

82
00:07:33,515 --> 00:07:38,182
 come into it, and all the pure in heart that

83
00:07:38,182 --> 00:07:42,849
 shall come into it shall see God

84
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:47,563
17 But if it be defiled I will not come into it,

85
00:07:47,563 --> 00:07:52,23
 and my glory shall not be there; for I will not

86
00:07:52,23 --> 00:07:56,897
 come into unholy temples

87
00:07:56,893 --> 00:08:02,893
18 And, now, behold, if Zion do these things she

88
00:08:02,893 --> 00:08:08,893
 shall prosper, and spread herself and become very

89
00:08:08,893 --> 00:08:14,893
 glorious, very great, and very terrible

90
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:19,261
19 And the nations of the earth shall honor her,

91
00:08:19,261 --> 00:08:23,861
 and shall say: Surely Zion is the city of our God,

92
00:08:23,861 --> 00:08:28,461
 and surely Zion cannot fall, neither be moved out

93
00:08:28,461 --> 00:08:33,061
 of her place, for God is there, and the hand of

94
00:08:33,061 --> 00:08:37,661
 the Lord is there

95
00:08:37,65 --> 00:08:44,65
20 And he hath sworn by the power of his might to

96
00:08:44,65 --> 00:08:51,65
 be her salvation and her high tower

97
00:08:51,414 --> 00:08:57,164
21 Therefore, verily, thus saith the Lord, let

98
00:08:57,164 --> 00:09:02,914
 Zion rejoice, for this is Zion—the pure in heart;

99
00:09:02,914 --> 00:09:08,664
 therefore, let Zion rejoice, while all the wicked

100
00:09:08,664 --> 00:09:14,414
 shall mourn

101
00:09:14,671 --> 00:09:20,004
22 For behold, and lo, vengeance cometh speedily

102
00:09:20,004 --> 00:09:25,337
 upon the ungodly as the whirlwind; and who shall

103
00:09:25,337 --> 00:09:30,67
 escape it

104
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:35,703
23 The Lord’s scourge shall pass over by night and

105
00:09:35,703 --> 00:09:40,703
 by day, and the report thereof shall vex all

106
00:09:40,703 --> 00:09:45,703
 people; yea, it shall not be stayed until the Lord

107
00:09:45,703 --> 00:09:50,703
 come

108
00:09:50,206 --> 00:09:53,873
24 For the indignation of the Lord is kindled

109
00:09:53,873 --> 00:09:57,54
 against their abominations and all their wicked works

110
00:09:57,54 --> 00:10:01,207


111
00:10:01,484 --> 00:10:06,984
25 Nevertheless, Zion shall escape if she observe

112
00:10:06,984 --> 00:10:12,484
 to do all things whatsoever I have commanded her

113
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:17,211
26 But if she observe not to do whatsoever I have

114
00:10:17,211 --> 00:10:22,411
 commanded her, I will visit her according to all

115
00:10:22,411 --> 00:10:27,611
 her works, with sore affliction, with pestilence,

116
00:10:27,611 --> 00:10:32,811
 with plague, with sword, with vengeance, with

117
00:10:32,811 --> 00:10:38,011
 devouring fire

118
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:43,771
27 Nevertheless, let it be read this once to her

119
00:10:43,771 --> 00:10:48,771
 ears, that I, the Lord, have accepted of her

120
00:10:48,771 --> 00:10:53,771
 offering; and if she sin no more none of these things

121
00:10:53,771 --> 00:10:58,771
 shall come upon her

122
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:04,275
28 And I will bless her with blessings, and

123
00:11:04,275 --> 00:11:10,025
 multiply a multiplicity of blessings upon her, and upon

124
00:11:10,025 --> 00:11:15,775
 her generations forever and ever, saith the Lord

125
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:21,525
 your God. Amen.
