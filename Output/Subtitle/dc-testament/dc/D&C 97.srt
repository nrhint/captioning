00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 97 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, August 2, 1833.

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
This revelation deals particularly with the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
affairs of the Saints in Zion, Jackson County,

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Missouri, in response to the Prophet’s inquiry of the

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Lord for information. Members of the Church in

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Missouri were at this time subjected to severe

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
persecution and, on July 23, 1833, had been forced to

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
sign an agreement to leave Jackson County. 
1–2,

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Many of the Saints in Zion (Jackson County,

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Missouri) are blessed for their faithfulness; 
3–5,

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Parley P. Pratt is commended for his labors in the

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
school in Zion; 
6–9, Those who observe their

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
covenants are accepted by the Lord; 
10–17, A house is

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
to be built in Zion in which the pure in heart

16
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
will see God; 
18–21, Zion is the pure in heart;

17
00:00:00,0 --> 02:22:46,
22–28, Zion will escape the Lord’s scourge if she is faithful. 

18
02:22:46,0 --> 02:22:46,0
1 Verily I say unto you my friends, I speak

19
02:22:46,0 --> 02:22:46,0
unto you with my voice, even the voice of my

20
02:22:46,0 --> 02:22:46,0
Spirit, that I may show unto you my will

21
02:22:46,0 --> 02:22:46,0
concerning your brethren in the land of Zion,

22
02:22:46,0 --> 02:22:46,0
many of whom are truly humble and are

23
02:22:46,0 --> 02:33:47,
seeking diligently to learn wisdom and to find truth.

24
02:33:47,0 --> 02:33:47,0
2 Verily, verily I say unto you, blessed

25
02:33:47,0 --> 02:33:47,0
are such, for they shall obtain; for I, the

26
02:33:47,0 --> 02:33:47,0
Lord, show mercy unto all the meek, and upon

27
02:33:47,0 --> 02:33:47,0
all whomsoever I will, that I may be

28
02:33:47,0 --> 02:50:49,
justified when I shall bring them unto judgment.

29
02:50:49,0 --> 02:50:49,0
3 Behold, I say unto you, concerning

30
02:50:49,0 --> 02:50:49,0
the school in Zion, I, the Lord, am

31
02:50:49,0 --> 02:50:49,0
well pleased that there should be a

32
02:50:49,0 --> 02:50:49,0
school in Zion, and also with my

33
02:50:49,0 --> 03:15:50,
servant Parley P. Pratt, for he abideth in me.

34
03:15:50,0 --> 03:15:50,0
4 And inasmuch as he continueth

35
03:15:50,0 --> 03:15:50,0
to abide in me he shall

36
03:15:50,0 --> 03:15:50,0
continue to preside over the school

37
03:15:50,0 --> 03:15:50,0
in the land of Zion until I

38
03:15:50,0 --> 03:17:54,
shall give unto him other commandments.

39
03:17:54,0 --> 03:17:54,0
5 And I will bless him

40
03:17:54,0 --> 03:17:54,0
with a multiplicity of

41
03:17:54,0 --> 03:17:54,0
blessings, in expounding all

42
03:17:54,0 --> 03:17:54,0
scriptures and mysteries to

43
03:17:54,0 --> 03:17:54,0
the edification of the

44
03:17:54,0 --> 03:36:54,
school, and of the church in Zion.

45
03:36:54,0 --> 03:36:54,0
6 And to the residue of

46
03:36:54,0 --> 03:36:54,0
the school, I, the Lord,

47
03:36:54,0 --> 03:36:54,0
am willing to show

48
03:36:54,0 --> 03:36:54,0
mercy; nevertheless, there

49
03:36:54,0 --> 03:36:54,0
are those that must needs

50
03:36:54,0 --> 03:36:54,0
be chastened, and their

51
03:36:54,0 --> 03:49:58,
works shall be made known.

52
03:49:58,0 --> 03:49:58,0
7 The ax is laid at the

53
03:49:58,0 --> 03:49:58,0
root of the trees; and

54
03:49:58,0 --> 03:49:58,0
every tree that

55
03:49:58,0 --> 03:49:58,0
bringeth not forth good fruit

56
03:49:58,0 --> 03:49:58,0
shall be hewn down and

57
03:49:58,0 --> 03:49:58,0
cast into the fire. I,

58
03:49:58,0 --> 04:12:59,
the Lord, have spoken it.

59
04:12:59,0 --> 04:12:59,0
8 Verily I say unto

60
04:12:59,0 --> 04:12:59,0
you, all among them who

61
04:12:59,0 --> 04:12:59,0
know their hearts are

62
04:12:59,0 --> 04:12:59,0
honest, and are

63
04:12:59,0 --> 04:12:59,0
broken, and their spirits

64
04:12:59,0 --> 04:12:59,0
contrite, and are

65
04:12:59,0 --> 04:12:59,0
willing to observe their

66
04:12:59,0 --> 04:12:59,0
covenants by

67
04:12:59,0 --> 04:12:59,0
sacrifice—yea, every sacrifice

68
04:12:59,0 --> 04:12:59,0
which I, the Lord, shall

69
04:12:59,0 --> 04:28:01,
command—they are accepted of me.

70
04:28:01,0 --> 04:28:01,0
9 For I, the Lord,

71
04:28:01,0 --> 04:28:01,0
will cause them to

72
04:28:01,0 --> 04:28:01,0
bring forth as a very

73
04:28:01,0 --> 04:28:01,0
fruitful tree which

74
04:28:01,0 --> 04:28:01,0
is planted in a

75
04:28:01,0 --> 04:28:01,0
goodly land, by a pure

76
04:28:01,0 --> 04:28:01,0
stream, that yieldeth

77
04:28:01,0 --> 04:46:02,
much precious fruit.

78
04:46:02,0 --> 04:46:02,0
10 Verily I say

79
04:46:02,0 --> 04:46:02,0
unto you, that it is

80
04:46:02,0 --> 04:46:02,0
my will that a

81
04:46:02,0 --> 04:46:02,0
house should be

82
04:46:02,0 --> 04:46:02,0
built unto me in the

83
04:46:02,0 --> 04:46:02,0
land of Zion, like

84
04:46:02,0 --> 04:46:02,0
unto the pattern

85
04:46:02,0 --> 04:49:41,
which I have given you.

86
04:49:41,0 --> 04:49:41,0
11 Yea, let it

87
04:49:41,0 --> 04:49:41,0
be built

88
04:49:41,0 --> 04:49:41,0
speedily, by the

89
04:49:41,0 --> 04:50:45,
tithing of my people.

90
04:50:45,0 --> 04:50:45,0
12 Behold,

91
04:50:45,0 --> 04:50:45,0
this is the

92
04:50:45,0 --> 04:50:45,0
tithing and the

93
04:50:45,0 --> 04:50:45,0
sacrifice which

94
04:50:45,0 --> 04:50:45,0
I, the Lord,

95
04:50:45,0 --> 04:50:45,0
require at their

96
04:50:45,0 --> 04:50:45,0
hands, that

97
04:50:45,0 --> 04:50:45,0
there may be a

98
04:50:45,0 --> 04:50:45,0
house built

99
04:50:45,0 --> 04:50:45,0
unto me for the

100
04:50:45,0 --> 05:20:47,
salvation of Zion—

101
05:20:47,0 --> 05:20:47,0
13 For a

102
05:20:47,0 --> 05:20:47,0
place of

103
05:20:47,0 --> 05:20:47,0
thanksgiving for all

104
05:20:47,0 --> 05:20:47,0
saints, and

105
05:20:47,0 --> 05:20:47,0
for a place of

106
05:20:47,0 --> 05:20:47,0
instruction

107
05:20:47,0 --> 05:20:47,0
for all those

108
05:20:47,0 --> 05:20:47,0
who are

109
05:20:47,0 --> 05:20:47,0
called to the

110
05:20:47,0 --> 05:20:47,0
work of the

111
05:20:47,0 --> 05:20:47,0
ministry in all

112
05:20:47,0 --> 05:20:47,0
their several

113
05:20:47,0 --> 05:43:48,
callings and offices;

114
05:43:48,0 --> 05:43:48,0
14 That they

115
05:43:48,0 --> 05:43:48,0
may be

116
05:43:48,0 --> 05:43:48,0
perfected in the

117
05:43:48,0 --> 05:43:48,0


118
05:43:48,0 --> 05:43:48,0
understanding of their

119
05:43:48,0 --> 05:43:48,0
ministry, in

120
05:43:48,0 --> 05:43:48,0
theory, in

121
05:43:48,0 --> 05:43:48,0
principle,

122
05:43:48,0 --> 05:43:48,0
and in

123
05:43:48,0 --> 05:43:48,0
doctrine, in all

124
05:43:48,0 --> 05:43:48,0
things

125
05:43:48,0 --> 05:43:48,0
pertaining to the

126
05:43:48,0 --> 05:43:48,0
kingdom of

127
05:43:48,0 --> 05:43:48,0
God on the

128
05:43:48,0 --> 05:43:48,0
earth, the

129
05:43:48,0 --> 05:43:48,0
keys of which

130
05:43:48,0 --> 05:43:48,0
kingdom have

131
05:43:48,0 --> 05:39:28,
been conferred upon you.

132
05:39:28,0 --> 05:39:28,0
15 And

133
05:39:28,0 --> 05:39:28,0
inasmuch as my

134
05:39:28,0 --> 05:39:28,0
people

135
05:39:28,0 --> 05:39:28,0
build a house

136
05:39:28,0 --> 05:39:28,0
unto me in

137
05:39:28,0 --> 05:39:28,0
the name of

138
05:39:28,0 --> 05:39:28,0
the Lord,

139
05:39:28,0 --> 05:39:28,0
and do not

140
05:39:28,0 --> 05:39:28,0
suffer any

141
05:39:28,0 --> 05:39:28,0
unclean

142
05:39:28,0 --> 05:39:28,0
thing to come

143
05:39:28,0 --> 05:39:28,0
into it,

144
05:39:28,0 --> 05:39:28,0
that it be not

145
05:39:28,0 --> 05:39:28,0
defiled,

146
05:39:28,0 --> 05:39:28,0
my glory

147
05:39:28,0 --> 05:44:33,
shall rest upon it;

148
05:44:33,0 --> 05:44:33,0
16 Yea,

149
05:44:33,0 --> 05:44:33,0
and my

150
05:44:33,0 --> 05:44:33,0
presence shall

151
05:44:33,0 --> 05:44:33,0
be there,

152
05:44:33,0 --> 05:44:33,0
for I will

153
05:44:33,0 --> 05:44:33,0
come into

154
05:44:33,0 --> 05:44:33,0
it, and

155
05:44:33,0 --> 05:44:33,0
all the

156
05:44:33,0 --> 05:44:33,0
pure in heart

157
05:44:33,0 --> 05:44:33,0
that

158
05:44:33,0 --> 05:44:33,0
shall come

159
05:44:33,0 --> 05:57:37,
into it shall see God.

160
05:57:37,0 --> 05:57:37,0
17 But if

161
05:57:37,0 --> 05:57:37,0
it be

162
05:57:37,0 --> 05:57:37,0
defiled I

163
05:57:37,0 --> 05:57:37,0
will not

164
05:57:37,0 --> 05:57:37,0
come into

165
05:57:37,0 --> 05:57:37,0
it, and

166
05:57:37,0 --> 05:57:37,0
my glory

167
05:57:37,0 --> 05:57:37,0
shall not

168
05:57:37,0 --> 05:57:37,0
be there;

169
05:57:37,0 --> 05:57:37,0
for I

170
05:57:37,0 --> 05:57:37,0
will not

171
05:57:37,0 --> 05:57:37,0
come into

172
05:57:37,0 --> 05:53:45,
unholy temples.

173
05:53:45,0 --> 05:53:45,0
18 And,

174
05:53:45,0 --> 05:53:45,0
now,

175
05:53:45,0 --> 05:53:45,0
behold, if

176
05:53:45,0 --> 05:53:45,0
Zion do

177
05:53:45,0 --> 05:53:45,0
these

178
05:53:45,0 --> 05:53:45,0
things she

179
05:53:45,0 --> 05:53:45,0
shall

180
05:53:45,0 --> 05:53:45,0
prosper,

181
05:53:45,0 --> 05:53:45,0
and

182
05:53:45,0 --> 05:53:45,0
spread

183
05:53:45,0 --> 05:53:45,0
herself and

184
05:53:45,0 --> 05:53:45,0
become

185
05:53:45,0 --> 05:53:45,0
very

186
05:53:45,0 --> 05:53:45,0
glorious,

187
05:53:45,0 --> 05:53:45,0
very great,

188
05:53:45,0 --> 05:58:50,
and very terrible.

189
05:58:50,0 --> 05:58:50,0
19 And

190
05:58:50,0 --> 05:58:50,0
the

191
05:58:50,0 --> 05:58:50,0
nations of

192
05:58:50,0 --> 05:58:50,0
the earth

193
05:58:50,0 --> 05:58:50,0
shall

194
05:58:50,0 --> 05:58:50,0
honor her,

195
05:58:50,0 --> 05:58:50,0
and

196
05:58:50,0 --> 05:58:50,0
shall say:

197
05:58:50,0 --> 05:58:50,0
Surely

198
05:58:50,0 --> 05:58:50,0
Zion is

199
05:58:50,0 --> 05:58:50,0
the city

200
05:58:50,0 --> 05:58:50,0
of our

201
05:58:50,0 --> 05:58:50,0
God, and

202
05:58:50,0 --> 05:58:50,0
surely

203
05:58:50,0 --> 05:58:50,0
Zion

204
05:58:50,0 --> 05:58:50,0
cannot fall,

205
05:58:50,0 --> 05:58:50,0
neither

206
05:58:50,0 --> 05:58:50,0
be

207
05:58:50,0 --> 05:58:50,0
moved out of

208
05:58:50,0 --> 05:58:50,0
her

209
05:58:50,0 --> 05:58:50,0
place, for

210
05:58:50,0 --> 05:58:50,0
God is

211
05:58:50,0 --> 05:58:50,0
there,

212
05:58:50,0 --> 05:58:50,0
and the

213
05:58:50,0 --> 05:58:50,0
hand of

214
05:58:50,0 --> 05:58:50,0
the Lord

215
05:58:50,0 --> 05:59:54,
is there;

216
05:59:54,0 --> 05:59:54,0
20 And

217
05:59:54,0 --> 05:59:54,0
he hath

218
05:59:54,0 --> 05:59:54,0
sworn

219
05:59:54,0 --> 05:59:54,0
by the

220
05:59:54,0 --> 05:59:54,0
