00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 112 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Prophet to Thomas B. Marsh, at Kirtland,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Ohio, July 23, 1837, concerning the Twelve Apostles

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of the Lamb. This revelation was received on the

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
day Elders Heber C. Kimball and Orson Hyde first

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
preached the gospel in England. Thomas B. Marsh

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
was at this time President of the Quorum of the

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Twelve Apostles. 
1–10, The Twelve are to send the

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
gospel and raise the warning voice to all nations

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and people; 
11–15, They are to take up their

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
cross, follow Jesus, and feed His sheep; 
16–20,

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Those who receive the First Presidency receive the

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Lord; 
21–29, Darkness covers the earth, and only

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
those who believe and are baptized will be

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
saved; 
30–34, The First Presidency and the Twelve

16
00:00:00,0 --> 02:04:50,
hold the keys of the dispensation of the fulness of times. 

17
02:04:50,0 --> 02:04:50,0
1 Verily thus saith the Lord unto you my servant

18
02:04:50,0 --> 02:04:50,0
Thomas: I have heard thy prayers; and thine alms

19
02:04:50,0 --> 02:04:50,0
have come up as a memorial before me, in behalf

20
02:04:50,0 --> 02:04:50,0
of those, thy brethren, who were chosen to bear

21
02:04:50,0 --> 02:04:50,0
testimony of my name and to send it abroad among

22
02:04:50,0 --> 02:04:50,0
all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, and

23
02:04:50,0 --> 02:07:52,
ordained through the instrumentality of my servants.

24
02:07:52,0 --> 02:07:52,0
2 Verily I say unto you, there have been

25
02:07:52,0 --> 02:07:52,0
some few things in thine heart and with thee

26
02:07:52,0 --> 02:52:52,
with which I, the Lord, was not well pleased.

27
02:52:52,0 --> 02:52:52,0
3 Nevertheless, inasmuch as thou hast

28
02:52:52,0 --> 02:52:52,0
abased thyself thou shalt be exalted;

29
02:52:52,0 --> 03:02:55,
therefore, all thy sins are forgiven thee.

30
03:02:55,0 --> 03:02:55,0
4 Let thy heart be of good cheer

31
03:02:55,0 --> 03:02:55,0
before my face; and thou shalt

32
03:02:55,0 --> 03:02:55,0
bear record of my name, not only

33
03:02:55,0 --> 03:02:55,0
unto the Gentiles, but also unto

34
03:02:55,0 --> 03:02:55,0
the Jews; and thou shalt send forth

35
03:02:55,0 --> 03:06:34,
my word unto the ends of the earth.

36
03:06:34,0 --> 03:06:34,0
5 Contend thou, therefore,

37
03:06:34,0 --> 03:06:34,0
morning by morning; and day after

38
03:06:34,0 --> 03:06:34,0
day let thy warning voice go

39
03:06:34,0 --> 03:06:34,0
forth; and when the night cometh

40
03:06:34,0 --> 03:06:34,0
let not the inhabitants of the

41
03:06:34,0 --> 03:15:37,
earth slumber, because of thy speech.

42
03:15:37,0 --> 03:15:37,0
6 Let thy habitation be

43
03:15:37,0 --> 03:15:37,0
known in Zion, and remove not

44
03:15:37,0 --> 03:15:37,0
thy house; for I, the Lord,

45
03:15:37,0 --> 03:15:37,0
have a great work for thee

46
03:15:37,0 --> 03:15:37,0
to do, in publishing my

47
03:15:37,0 --> 03:17:41,
name among the children of men.

48
03:17:41,0 --> 03:17:41,0
7 Therefore, gird up thy

49
03:17:41,0 --> 03:17:41,0
loins for the work. Let thy

50
03:17:41,0 --> 03:17:41,0
feet be shod also, for

51
03:17:41,0 --> 03:17:41,0
thou art chosen, and thy

52
03:17:41,0 --> 03:17:41,0
path lieth among the

53
03:17:41,0 --> 03:37:18,
mountains, and among many nations.

54
03:37:18,0 --> 03:37:18,0
8 And by thy word many

55
03:37:18,0 --> 03:37:18,0
high ones shall be brought

56
03:37:18,0 --> 03:37:18,0
low, and by thy word many

57
03:37:18,0 --> 03:40:20,
low ones shall be exalted.

58
03:40:20,0 --> 03:40:20,0
9 Thy voice shall be

59
03:40:20,0 --> 03:40:20,0
a rebuke unto the

60
03:40:20,0 --> 03:40:20,0
transgressor; and at thy

61
03:40:20,0 --> 03:40:20,0
rebuke let the

62
03:40:20,0 --> 03:40:20,0
tongue of the slanderer

63
03:40:20,0 --> 03:57:22,
cease its perverseness.

64
03:57:22,0 --> 03:57:22,0
10 Be thou humble;

65
03:57:22,0 --> 03:57:22,0
and the Lord thy God

66
03:57:22,0 --> 03:57:22,0
shall lead thee by the

67
03:57:22,0 --> 03:57:22,0
hand, and give thee

68
03:57:22,0 --> 04:06:24,
answer to thy prayers.

69
04:06:24,0 --> 04:06:24,0
11 I know thy heart,

70
04:06:24,0 --> 04:06:24,0
and have heard thy

71
04:06:24,0 --> 04:06:24,0
prayers concerning

72
04:06:24,0 --> 04:06:24,0
thy brethren. Be not

73
04:06:24,0 --> 04:06:24,0
partial towards them

74
04:06:24,0 --> 04:06:24,0
in love above many

75
04:06:24,0 --> 04:06:24,0
others, but let thy

76
04:06:24,0 --> 04:06:24,0
love be for them as

77
04:06:24,0 --> 04:06:24,0
for thyself; and let

78
04:06:24,0 --> 04:06:24,0
thy love abound

79
04:06:24,0 --> 04:06:24,0
unto all men, and unto

80
04:06:24,0 --> 04:10:03,
all who love my name.

81
04:10:03,0 --> 04:10:03,0
12 And pray for thy

82
04:10:03,0 --> 04:10:03,0
brethren of the

83
04:10:03,0 --> 04:10:03,0
Twelve. Admonish them

84
04:10:03,0 --> 04:10:03,0
sharply for my

85
04:10:03,0 --> 04:10:03,0
name’s sake, and let

86
04:10:03,0 --> 04:10:03,0
them be admonished

87
04:10:03,0 --> 04:10:03,0
for all their sins,

88
04:10:03,0 --> 04:10:03,0
and be ye faithful

89
04:10:03,0 --> 04:13:42,
before me unto my name.

90
04:13:42,0 --> 04:13:42,0
13 And after their

91
04:13:42,0 --> 04:13:42,0
temptations, and

92
04:13:42,0 --> 04:13:42,0
much tribulation,

93
04:13:42,0 --> 04:13:42,0
behold, I, the

94
04:13:42,0 --> 04:13:42,0
Lord, will feel after

95
04:13:42,0 --> 04:13:42,0
them, and if they

96
04:13:42,0 --> 04:13:42,0
harden not their

97
04:13:42,0 --> 04:13:42,0
hearts, and

98
04:13:42,0 --> 04:13:42,0
stiffen not their necks

99
04:13:42,0 --> 04:13:42,0
against me, they

100
04:13:42,0 --> 04:13:42,0
shall be converted,

101
04:13:42,0 --> 04:17:49,
and I will heal them.

102
04:17:49,0 --> 04:17:49,0
14 Now, I say

103
04:17:49,0 --> 04:17:49,0
unto you, and what I

104
04:17:49,0 --> 04:17:49,0
say unto you, I

105
04:17:49,0 --> 04:17:49,0
say unto all the

106
04:17:49,0 --> 04:17:49,0
Twelve: Arise and

107
04:17:49,0 --> 04:17:49,0
gird up your

108
04:17:49,0 --> 04:17:49,0
loins, take up your

109
04:17:49,0 --> 04:17:49,0
cross, follow me,

110
04:17:49,0 --> 04:17:27,
and feed my sheep.

111
04:17:27,0 --> 04:17:27,0
15 Exalt not

112
04:17:27,0 --> 04:17:27,0
yourselves; rebel not

113
04:17:27,0 --> 04:17:27,0
against my

114
04:17:27,0 --> 04:17:27,0
servant Joseph; for

115
04:17:27,0 --> 04:17:27,0
verily I say unto

116
04:17:27,0 --> 04:17:27,0
you, I am with

117
04:17:27,0 --> 04:17:27,0
him, and my hand

118
04:17:27,0 --> 04:17:27,0
shall be over him;

119
04:17:27,0 --> 04:17:27,0
and the keys which

120
04:17:27,0 --> 04:17:27,0
I have given

121
04:17:27,0 --> 04:17:27,0
unto him, and also

122
04:17:27,0 --> 04:17:27,0
to youward, shall

123
04:17:27,0 --> 04:17:27,0
not be taken from

124
04:17:27,0 --> 04:13:07,
him till I come.

125
04:13:07,0 --> 04:13:07,0
16 Verily I say

126
04:13:07,0 --> 04:13:07,0
unto you, my

127
04:13:07,0 --> 04:13:07,0
servant Thomas,

128
04:13:07,0 --> 04:13:07,0
thou art the man

129
04:13:07,0 --> 04:13:07,0
whom I have chosen

130
04:13:07,0 --> 04:13:07,0
to hold the

131
04:13:07,0 --> 04:13:07,0
keys of my kingdom,

132
04:13:07,0 --> 04:13:07,0
as pertaining

133
04:13:07,0 --> 04:13:07,0
to the Twelve,

134
04:13:07,0 --> 04:14:11,
abroad among all nations—

135
04:14:11,0 --> 04:14:11,0
17 That thou

136
04:14:11,0 --> 04:14:11,0
mayest be my

137
04:14:11,0 --> 04:14:11,0
servant to

138
04:14:11,0 --> 04:14:11,0
unlock the door of

139
04:14:11,0 --> 04:14:11,0
the kingdom in

140
04:14:11,0 --> 04:14:11,0
all places

141
04:14:11,0 --> 04:14:11,0
where my servant

142
04:14:11,0 --> 04:14:11,0
Joseph, and

143
04:14:11,0 --> 04:14:11,0
my servant

144
04:14:11,0 --> 04:14:11,0
Sidney, and my

145
04:14:11,0 --> 04:17:50,
servant Hyrum, cannot come;

146
04:17:50,0 --> 04:17:50,0
18 For on

147
04:17:50,0 --> 04:17:50,0
them have I laid

148
04:17:50,0 --> 04:17:50,0
the burden

149
04:17:50,0 --> 04:17:50,0
of all the

150
04:17:50,0 --> 04:17:50,0
churches for a

151
04:17:50,0 --> 04:17:28,
little season.

152
04:17:28,0 --> 04:17:28,0
19

153
04:17:28,0 --> 04:17:28,0
Wherefore,

154
04:17:28,0 --> 04:17:28,0
whithersoever they

155
04:17:28,0 --> 04:17:28,0
shall send you,

156
04:17:28,0 --> 04:17:28,0
go ye, and

157
04:17:28,0 --> 04:17:28,0
I will be

158
04:17:28,0 --> 04:17:28,0
with you; and

159
04:17:28,0 --> 04:17:28,0
in

160
04:17:28,0 --> 04:17:28,0
whatsoever place ye

161
04:17:28,0 --> 04:17:28,0
shall

162
04:17:28,0 --> 04:17:28,0
proclaim my name an

163
04:17:28,0 --> 04:17:28,0
effectual

164
04:17:28,0 --> 04:17:28,0
door shall be

165
04:17:28,0 --> 04:17:28,0
opened unto

166
04:17:28,0 --> 04:17:28,0
you, that

167
04:17:28,0 --> 04:13:08,
they may receive my word.

168
04:13:08,0 --> 04:13:08,0
20

169
04:13:08,0 --> 04:13:08,0
Whosoever receiveth

170
04:13:08,0 --> 04:13:08,0
my word

171
04:13:08,0 --> 04:13:08,0
receiveth me,

172
04:13:08,0 --> 04:13:08,0
and

173
04:13:08,0 --> 04:13:08,0
whosoever

174
04:13:08,0 --> 04:13:08,0
receiveth me,

175
04:13:08,0 --> 04:13:08,0
receiveth

176
04:13:08,0 --> 04:13:08,0
those, the First

177
04:13:08,0 --> 04:13:08,0


178
04:13:08,0 --> 04:13:08,0
Presidency, whom I

179
04:13:08,0 --> 04:13:08,0
have sent,

180
04:13:08,0 --> 04:13:08,0
whom I have

181
04:13:08,0 --> 04:13:08,0
made

182
04:13:08,0 --> 04:13:08,0
counselors for my

183
04:13:08,0 --> 04:14:12,
name’s sake unto you.

184
04:14:12,0 --> 04:14:12,0
21 And

185
04:14:12,0 --> 04:14:12,0
again, I say

186
04:14:12,0 --> 04:14:12,0
unto you,

187
04:14:12,0 --> 04:14:12,0
that

188
04:14:12,0 --> 04:14:12,0
whosoever ye

189
04:14:12,0 --> 04:14:12,0
shall send

190
04:14:12,0 --> 04:14:12,0
in my name,

191
04:14:12,0 --> 04:14:12,0
by the

192
04:14:12,0 --> 04:14:12,0
voice of

193
04:14:12,0 --> 04:14:12,0
your

194
04:14:12,0 --> 04:14:12,0
brethren, the

195
04:14:12,0 --> 04:14:12,0
Twelve, duly

196
04:14:12,0 --> 04:14:12,0
recommended

197
04:14:12,0 --> 04:14:12,0
and

198
04:14:12,0 --> 04:14:12,0
authorized by

199
04:14:12,0 --> 04:14:12,0
you, shall

200
04:14:12,0 --> 04:14:12,0
have power

201
04:14:12,0 --> 04:14:12,0
to open

202
04:14:12,0 --> 04:14:12,0
the door of

203
04:14:12,0 --> 04:14:12,0
my

204
04:14:12,0 --> 04:14:12,0
kingdom unto any

205
04:14:12,0 --> 04:14:12,0
nation

206
04:14:12,0 --> 04:17:51,
whithersoever ye shall send them—

207
04:17:51,0 --> 04:17:51,0
22

208
04:17:51,0 --> 04:17:51,0
Inasmuch as

209
04:17:51,0 --> 04:17:51,0
they shall

210
04:17:51,0 --> 04:17:51,0
humble

211
04:17:51,0 --> 04:17:51,0
themselves

212
04:17:51,0 --> 04:17:51,0
before me,

213
04:17:51,0 --> 04:17:51,0
and

214
04:17:51,0 --> 04:17:51,0
abide in my

215
04:17:51,0 --> 04:17:51,0
word, and

216
04:17:51,0 --> 04:17:51,0
hearken

217
04:17:51,0 --> 04:17:51,0
