1
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:18,403
Section 112 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:18,403 --> 00:00:25,528
 the Prophet to Thomas B. Marsh, at Kirtland, Ohio,

3
00:00:25,528 --> 00:00:32,653
 July 23, 1837, concerning the Twelve Apostles of

4
00:00:32,653 --> 00:00:39,778
 the Lamb. This revelation was received on the day

5
00:00:39,778 --> 00:00:46,903
 Elders Heber C. Kimball and Orson Hyde first

6
00:00:46,903 --> 00:00:54,028
 preached the gospel in England. Thomas B. Marsh was at

7
00:00:54,028 --> 00:01:01,153
 this time President of the Quorum of the Twelve

8
00:01:01,153 --> 00:01:08,278
 Apostles. 
1–10, The Twelve are to send the gospel

9
00:01:08,278 --> 00:01:15,403
 and raise the warning voice to all nations and

10
00:01:15,403 --> 00:01:22,528
 people; 
11–15, They are to take up their cross,

11
00:01:22,528 --> 00:01:29,653
 follow Jesus, and feed His sheep; 
16–20, Those who

12
00:01:29,653 --> 00:01:36,778
 receive the First Presidency receive the Lord;

13
00:01:36,778 --> 00:01:43,903
21–29, Darkness covers the earth, and only those who

14
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:51,028
 believe and are baptized will be saved; 
30–34, The

15
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:58,153
 First Presidency and the Twelve hold the keys of

16
00:01:58,153 --> 00:02:05,278
 the dispensation of the fulness of times.

17
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:12,549
1 Verily thus saith the Lord unto you my servant

18
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:19,406
 Thomas: I have heard thy prayers; and thine alms

19
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:26,263
 have come up as a memorial before me, in behalf of

20
00:02:26,263 --> 00:02:33,12
 those, thy brethren, who were chosen to bear

21
00:02:33,12 --> 00:02:39,977
 testimony of my name and to send it abroad among all

22
00:02:39,977 --> 00:02:46,834
 nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, and ordained

23
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:53,691
 through the instrumentality of my servants

24
00:02:53,64 --> 00:02:56,973
2 Verily I say unto you, there have been some few

25
00:02:56,973 --> 00:03:00,306
 things in thine heart and with thee with which I,

26
00:03:00,306 --> 00:03:03,639
 the Lord, was not well pleased

27
00:03:03,65 --> 00:03:07,983
3 Nevertheless, inasmuch as thou hast abased

28
00:03:07,983 --> 00:03:12,316
 thyself thou shalt be exalted; therefore, all thy sins

29
00:03:12,316 --> 00:03:16,649
 are forgiven thee

30
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:21,696
4 Let thy heart be of good cheer before my face;

31
00:03:21,696 --> 00:03:26,696
 and thou shalt bear record of my name, not only

32
00:03:26,696 --> 00:03:31,696
 unto the Gentiles, but also unto the Jews; and thou

33
00:03:31,696 --> 00:03:36,696
 shalt send forth my word unto the ends of the

34
00:03:36,696 --> 00:03:41,696
 earth

35
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:45,554
5 Contend thou, therefore, morning by morning; and

36
00:03:45,554 --> 00:03:50,054
 day after day let thy warning voice go forth; and

37
00:03:50,054 --> 00:03:54,554
 when the night cometh let not the inhabitants of

38
00:03:54,554 --> 00:03:59,054
 the earth slumber, because of thy speech

39
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:04,389
6 Let thy habitation be known in Zion, and remove

40
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:09,389
 not thy house; for I, the Lord, have a great work

41
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:14,389
 for thee to do, in publishing my name among the

42
00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:19,389
 children of men

43
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:25,142
7 Therefore, gird up thy loins for the work. Let

44
00:04:25,142 --> 00:04:30,892
 thy feet be shod also, for thou art chosen, and thy

45
00:04:30,892 --> 00:04:36,642
 path lieth among the mountains, and among many

46
00:04:36,642 --> 00:04:42,392
 nations

47
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:45,399
8 And by thy word many high ones shall be brought

48
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:48,399
 low, and by thy word many low ones shall be

49
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:51,399
 exalted

50
00:04:51,975 --> 00:05:01,642
9 Thy voice shall be a rebuke unto the

51
00:05:01,642 --> 00:05:11,309
 transgressor; and at thy rebuke let the tongue of the

52
00:05:11,309 --> 00:05:20,976
 slanderer cease its perverseness

53
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:24,82
10 Be thou humble; and the Lord thy God shall lead

54
00:05:24,82 --> 00:05:29,153
 thee by the hand, and give thee answer to thy

55
00:05:29,153 --> 00:05:33,486
 prayers

56
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:40,767
11 I know thy heart, and have heard thy prayers

57
00:05:40,767 --> 00:05:47,767
 concerning thy brethren. Be not partial towards them

58
00:05:47,767 --> 00:05:54,767
 in love above many others, but let thy love be

59
00:05:54,767 --> 00:06:01,767
 for them as for thyself; and let thy love abound

60
00:06:01,767 --> 00:06:08,767
 unto all men, and unto all who love my name

61
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:13,268
12 And pray for thy brethren of the Twelve.

62
00:06:13,268 --> 00:06:18,268
 Admonish them sharply for my name’s sake, and let them

63
00:06:18,268 --> 00:06:23,268
 be admonished for all their sins, and be ye

64
00:06:23,268 --> 00:06:28,268
 faithful before me unto my name

65
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:33,621
13 And after their temptations, and much

66
00:06:33,621 --> 00:06:39,221
 tribulation, behold, I, the Lord, will feel after them, and

67
00:06:39,221 --> 00:06:44,821
 if they harden not their hearts, and stiffen not

68
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:50,421
 their necks against me, they shall be converted,

69
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:56,021
 and I will heal them

70
00:06:56,783 --> 00:07:03,283
14 Now, I say unto you, and what I say unto you, I

71
00:07:03,283 --> 00:07:09,783
 say unto all the Twelve: Arise and gird up your

72
00:07:09,783 --> 00:07:16,283
 loins, take up your cross, follow me, and feed my

73
00:07:16,283 --> 00:07:22,783
 sheep

74
00:07:22,292 --> 00:07:29,692
15 Exalt not yourselves; rebel not against my

75
00:07:29,692 --> 00:07:37,092
 servant Joseph; for verily I say unto you, I am with

76
00:07:37,092 --> 00:07:44,492
 him, and my hand shall be over him; and the keys

77
00:07:44,492 --> 00:07:51,892
 which I have given unto him, and also to youward,

78
00:07:51,892 --> 00:07:59,292
 shall not be taken from him till I come

79
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:05,045
16 Verily I say unto you, my servant Thomas, thou

80
00:08:05,045 --> 00:08:11,045
 art the man whom I have chosen to hold the keys of

81
00:08:11,045 --> 00:08:17,045
 my kingdom, as pertaining to the Twelve, abroad

82
00:08:17,045 --> 00:08:23,045
 among all nations

83
00:08:23,82 --> 00:08:29,57
17 That thou mayest be my servant to unlock the

84
00:08:29,57 --> 00:08:35,32
 door of the kingdom in all places where my servant

85
00:08:35,32 --> 00:08:41,07
 Joseph, and my servant Sidney, and my servant

86
00:08:41,07 --> 00:08:46,82
 Hyrum, cannot come

87
00:08:46,81 --> 00:08:52,81
18 For on them have I laid the burden of all the

88
00:08:52,81 --> 00:08:58,81
 churches for a little season

89
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:12,971
19 Wherefore, whithersoever they shall send you,

90
00:09:12,971 --> 00:09:27,371
 go ye, and I will be with you; and in whatsoever

91
00:09:27,371 --> 00:09:41,771
 place ye shall proclaim my name an effectual door

92
00:09:41,771 --> 00:09:56,171
 shall be opened unto you, that they may receive my

93
00:09:56,171 --> 00:10:10,571
 word

94
00:10:10,493 --> 00:10:10,493
20 Whosoever receiveth my word receiveth me, and

95
00:10:10,493 --> 00:10:10,493
 whosoever receiveth me, receiveth those, the First

96
00:10:10,493 --> 00:10:10,493
 Presidency, whom I have sent, whom I have made

97
00:10:10,493 --> 00:10:10,493
 counselors for my name’s sake unto you

98
00:10:10,827 --> 00:10:17,16
21 And again, I say unto you, that whosoever ye

99
00:10:17,16 --> 00:10:23,493
 shall send in my name, by the voice of your

100
00:10:23,493 --> 00:10:29,826
 brethren, the Twelve, duly recommended and authorized by

101
00:10:29,826 --> 00:10:36,159
 you, shall have power to open the door of my

102
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:42,492
 kingdom unto any nation whithersoever ye shall send

103
00:10:42,492 --> 00:10:48,825
 them

104
00:10:48,798 --> 00:10:53,798
22 Inasmuch as they shall humble themselves before

105
00:10:53,798 --> 00:10:58,798
 me, and abide in my word, and hearken to the

106
00:10:58,798 --> 00:11:03,798
 voice of my Spirit

107
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:07,346
23 Verily, verily, I say unto you, darkness

108
00:11:07,346 --> 00:11:11,596
 covereth the earth, and gross darkness the minds of the

109
00:11:11,596 --> 00:11:15,846
 people, and all flesh has become corrupt before my

110
00:11:15,846 --> 00:11:20,096
 face

111
00:11:20,38 --> 00:11:28,38
24 Behold, vengeance cometh speedily upon the

112
00:11:28,38 --> 00:11:36,38
 inhabitants of the earth, a day of wrath, a day of

113
00:11:36,38 --> 00:11:44,38
 burning, a day of desolation, of weeping, of

114
00:11:44,38 --> 00:11:52,38
 mourning, and of lamentation; and as a whirlwind it shall

115
00:11:52,38 --> 00:12:00,38
 come upon all the face of the earth, saith the

116
00:12:00,38 --> 00:12:08,38
 Lord

117
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:10,828
25 And upon my house shall it begin, and from my

118
00:12:10,828 --> 00:12:13,328
 house shall it go forth, saith the Lord

119
00:12:13,85 --> 00:12:22,35
26 First among those among you, saith the Lord,

120
00:12:22,35 --> 00:12:30,85
 who have professed to know my name and have not

121
00:12:30,85 --> 00:12:39,35
 known me, and have blasphemed against me in the midst

122
00:12:39,35 --> 00:12:47,85
 of my house, saith the Lord

123
00:12:47,533 --> 00:13:03,533
27 Therefore, see to it that ye trouble not

124
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:19,533
 yourselves concerning the affairs of my church in this

125
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:35,533
 place, saith the Lord

126
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,148
28 But purify your hearts before me; and then go

127
00:13:38,148 --> 00:13:40,815
 ye into all the world, and preach my gospel unto

128
00:13:40,815 --> 00:13:43,482
 every creature who has not received it

129
00:13:43,473 --> 00:13:43,473
29 And he that believeth and is baptized shall be

130
00:13:43,473 --> 00:13:43,473
 saved, and he that believeth not, and is not

131
00:13:43,473 --> 00:13:43,473
 baptized, shall be damned

132
00:13:43,806 --> 00:13:47,473
30 For unto you, the Twelve, and those, the First

133
00:13:47,473 --> 00:13:51,14
 Presidency, who are appointed with you to be your

134
00:13:51,14 --> 00:13:54,807
 counselors and your leaders, is the power of this

135
00:13:54,807 --> 00:13:58,474
 priesthood given, for the last days and for the

136
00:13:58,474 --> 00:14:02,141
 last time, in the which is the dispensation of the

137
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:05,808
 fulness of times

138
00:14:05,795 --> 00:14:10,462
31 Which power you hold, in connection with all

139
00:14:10,462 --> 00:14:15,129
 those who have received a dispensation at any time

140
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:19,796
 from the beginning of the creation

141
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:24,075
32 For verily I say unto you, the keys of the

142
00:14:24,075 --> 00:14:28,825
 dispensation, which ye have received, have come down

143
00:14:28,825 --> 00:14:33,575
 from the fathers, and last of all, being sent down

144
00:14:33,575 --> 00:14:38,325
 from heaven unto you

145
00:14:38,094 --> 00:14:42,594
33 Verily I say unto you, behold how great is your

146
00:14:42,594 --> 00:14:47,094
 calling. Cleanse your hearts and your garments,

147
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:51,594
 lest the blood of this generation be required at

148
00:14:51,594 --> 00:14:56,094
 your hands

149
00:14:56,095 --> 00:15:01,845
34 Be faithful until I come, for I come quickly;

150
00:15:01,845 --> 00:15:07,595
 and my reward is with me to recompense every man

151
00:15:07,595 --> 00:15:13,345
 according as his work shall be. I am Alpha and

152
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:19,095
 Omega. Amen.
