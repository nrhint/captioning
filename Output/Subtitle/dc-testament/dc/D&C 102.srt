00:07:01,89 --> 00:07:06,69
 two other presidents, appointed after the same

65
00:07:06,69 --> 00:07:11,49

11 And in case of the absence of one or both of

67
00:07:17,114 --> 00:07:22,447

12 Whenever a high council of the church of Christ

73
00:07:48,033 --> 00:07:52,319
 is regularly organized, according to the

74
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,605
 foregoing pattern, it shall be the duty of the twelve

75
00:07:56,605 --> 00:08:00,891
 councilors to cast lots by numbers, and thereby

76
00:08:00,891 --> 00:08:05,177
 ascertain who of the twelve shall speak first,

77
00:08:05,177 --> 00:08:09,463
 commencing with number one and so in succession to number

78
00:08:09,463 --> 00:08:13,749
 twelve

79
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:18,927
13 Whenever this council convenes to act upon any

80
00:08:18,927 --> 00:08:24,127
 case, the twelve councilors shall consider whether

81
00:08:24,127 --> 00:08:29,327
 it is a difficult one or not; if it is not, two

82
00:08:29,327 --> 00:08:34,527
 only of the councilors shall speak upon it,

83
00:08:34,527 --> 00:08:39,727
 according to the form above written

84
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:44,469
14 But if it is thought to be difficult, four

85
00:08:44,469 --> 00:08:49,219
 shall be appointed; and if more difficult, six; but in

86
00:08:49,219 --> 00:08:53,969
 no case shall more than six be appointed to

87
00:08:53,969 --> 00:08:58,719
 speak

88
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:03,671
15 The accused, in all cases, has a right to

89
00:09:03,671 --> 00:09:09,338
 one-half of the council, to prevent insult or

90
00:09:09,338 --> 00:09:15,005
 injustice

91
00:09:15,538 --> 00:09:21,138
16 And the councilors appointed to speak before

92
00:09:21,138 --> 00:09:26,738
 the council are to present the case, after the

93
00:09:26,738 --> 00:09:32,338
 evidence is examined, in its true light before the

94
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:37,938
 council; and every man is to speak according to equity

95
00:09:37,938 --> 00:09:43,538
 and justice

96
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:48,033
17 Those councilors who draw even numbers, that

97
00:09:48,033 --> 00:09:52,783
 is, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12, are the individuals who

98
00:09:52,783 --> 00:09:57,533
 are to stand up in behalf of the accused, and

99
00:09:57,533 --> 00:10:02,283
 prevent insult and injustice

100
00:10:02,786 --> 00:10:08,786
18 In all cases the accuser and the accused shall

101
00:10:08,786 --> 00:10:14,786
 have a privilege of speaking for themselves before

102
00:10:14,786 --> 00:10:20,786
 the council, after the evidences are heard and

103
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:26,786
 the councilors who are appointed to speak on the

104
00:10:26,786 --> 00:10:32,786
 case have finished their remarks

105
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:38,865
19 After the evidences are heard, the councilors,

106
00:10:38,865 --> 00:10:45,198
 accuser and accused have spoken, the president

107
00:10:45,198 --> 00:10:51,531
 shall give a decision according to the understanding

108
00:10:51,531 --> 00:10:57,864
 which he shall have of the case, and call upon the

109
00:10:57,864 --> 00:11:04,197
 twelve councilors to sanction the same by their

110
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:10,53
 vote

111
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:14,203
20 But should the remaining councilors, who have

112
00:11:14,203 --> 00:11:17,803
 not spoken, or any one of them, after hearing the

113
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:21,403
 evidences and pleadings impartially, discover an

114
00:11:21,403 --> 00:11:25,003
 error in the decision of the president, they can

115
00:11:25,003 --> 00:11:28,603
 manifest it, and the case shall have a re-hearing

116
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:32,888
21 And if, after a careful re-hearing, any

117
00:11:32,888 --> 00:11:36,888
 additional light is shown upon the case, the decision

118
00:11:36,888 --> 00:11:40,888
 shall be altered accordingly

119
00:11:40,4 --> 00:11:44,733
22 But in case no additional light is given, the

120
00:11:44,733 --> 00:11:49,066
 first decision shall stand, the majority of the

121
00:11:49,066 --> 00:11:53,399
 council having power to determine the same

122
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:58,613
23 In case of difficulty respecting doctrine or

123
00:11:58,613 --> 00:12:03,813
 principle, if there is not a sufficiency written to

124
00:12:03,813 --> 00:12:09,013
 make the case clear to the minds of the council,

125
00:12:09,013 --> 00:12:14,213
 the president may inquire and obtain the mind of

126
00:12:14,213 --> 00:12:19,413
 the Lord by revelation

127
00:12:19,923 --> 00:12:25,923
24 The high priests, when abroad, have power to

128
00:12:25,923 --> 00:12:31,923
 call and organize a council after the manner of the

129
00:12:31,923 --> 00:12:37,923
 foregoing, to settle difficulties, when the

130
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:43,923
 parties or either of them shall request it

131
00:12:43,413 --> 00:12:47,08
25 And the said council of high priests shall have

132
00:12:47,08 --> 00:12:50,747
 power to appoint one of their own number to

133
00:12:50,747 --> 00:12:54,414
 preside over such council for the time being

134
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:59,491
26 It shall be the duty of said council to

135
00:12:59,491 --> 00:13:04,291
 transmit, immediately, a copy of their proceedings, with

136
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:09,091
 a full statement of the testimony accompanying

137
00:13:09,091 --> 00:13:13,891
 their decision, to the high council of the seat of

138
00:13:13,891 --> 00:13:18,691
 the First Presidency of the Church

139
00:13:18,181 --> 00:13:23,181
27 Should the parties or either of them be

140
00:13:23,181 --> 00:13:28,181
 dissatisfied with the decision of said council, they may

141
00:13:28,181 --> 00:13:33,181
 appeal to the high council of the seat of the

142
00:13:33,181 --> 00:13:38,181
 First Presidency of the Church, and have a re-hearing,

143
00:13:38,181 --> 00:13:43,181
 which case shall there be conducted, according to

144
00:13:43,181 --> 00:13:48,181
 the former pattern written, as though no such

145
00:13:48,181 --> 00:13:53,181
 decision had been made

146
00:13:53,216 --> 00:13:58,716
28 This council of high priests abroad is only to

147
00:13:58,716 --> 00:14:04,216
 be called on the most difficult cases of church

148
00:14:04,216 --> 00:14:09,716
 matters; and no common or ordinary case is to be

149
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:15,216
 sufficient to call such council

150
00:14:15,972 --> 00:14:20,305
29 The traveling or located high priests abroad

151
00:14:20,305 --> 00:14:24,638
 have power to say whether it is necessary to call

152
00:14:24,638 --> 00:14:28,971
 such a council or not

153
00:14:28,985 --> 00:14:32,735
30 There is a distinction between the high council

154
00:14:32,735 --> 00:14:36,485
 or traveling high priests abroad, and the

155
00:14:36,485 --> 00:14:40,235
 traveling high council composed of the twelve apostles,

156
00:14:40,235 --> 00:14:43,985
 in their decisions

157
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:47,983
31 From the decision of the former there can be an

158
00:14:47,983 --> 00:14:51,983
 appeal; but from the decision of the latter there

159
00:14:51,983 --> 00:14:55,983
 cannot

160
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:59,495
32 The latter can only be called in question by

161
00:14:59,495 --> 00:15:03,495
 the general authorities of the church in case of

162
00:15:03,495 --> 00:15:07,495
 transgression

163
00:15:07,49 --> 00:15:13,99
33 Resolved: that the president or presidents of

164
00:15:13,99 --> 00:15:20,49
 the seat of the First Presidency of the Church

165
00:15:20,49 --> 00:15:26,99
 shall have power to determine whether any such case,

166
00:15:26,99 --> 00:15:33,49
 as may be appealed, is justly entitled to a

167
00:15:33,49 --> 00:15:39,99
 re-hearing, after examining the appeal and the evidences

168
00:15:39,99 --> 00:15:46,49
 and statements accompanying it
