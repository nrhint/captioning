00:00:11,295 --> 00:00:19,545
Section 106 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:19,545 --> 00:00:27,795
 the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, November 25, 1834.

3
00:00:27,795 --> 00:00:36,045
 This revelation is directed to Warren A. Cowdery,

4
00:00:36,045 --> 00:00:44,295
 an older brother of Oliver Cowdery. 
1–3,

5
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:52,545
 Warren A. Cowdery is called as a local presiding officer;

6
00:00:52,545 --> 00:01:00,795
4–5, The Second Coming will not overtake the

7
00:01:00,795 --> 00:01:09,045
 children of light as a thief; 
6–8, Great blessings

8
00:01:09,045 --> 00:01:17,295
 follow faithful service in the Church.

9
00:01:17,21 --> 00:01:23,21
1 It is my will that my servant Warren A. Cowdery

10
00:01:23,21 --> 00:01:29,21
 should be appointed and ordained a presiding high

11
00:01:29,21 --> 00:01:35,21
 priest over my church, in the land of Freedom and

12
00:01:35,21 --> 00:01:41,21
 the regions round about

13
00:01:41,752 --> 00:01:48,419
2 And should preach my everlasting gospel, and

14
00:01:48,419 --> 00:01:55,086
 lift up his voice and warn the people, not only in

15
00:01:55,086 --> 00:02:01,753
 his own place, but in the adjoining counties

16
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:08,755
3 And devote his whole time to this high and holy

17
00:02:08,755 --> 00:02:15,755
 calling, which I now give unto him, seeking

18
00:02:15,755 --> 00:02:22,755
 diligently the kingdom of heaven and its righteousness,

19
00:02:22,755 --> 00:02:29,755
 and all things necessary shall be added thereunto;

20
00:02:29,755 --> 00:02:36,755
 for the laborer is worthy of his hire

21
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:42,023
4 And again, verily I say unto you, the coming of

22
00:02:42,023 --> 00:02:48,023
 the Lord draweth nigh, and it overtaketh the world

23
00:02:48,023 --> 00:02:54,023
 as a thief in the night

24
00:02:54,558 --> 00:03:03,558
5 Therefore, gird up your loins, that you may be

25
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:12,558
 the children of light, and that day shall not

26
00:03:12,558 --> 00:03:21,558
 overtake you as a thief

27
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:28,835
6 And again, verily I say unto you, there was joy

28
00:03:28,835 --> 00:03:35,835
 in heaven when my servant Warren bowed to my

29
00:03:35,835 --> 00:03:42,835
 scepter, and separated himself from the crafts of men

30
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:47,855
7 Therefore, blessed is my servant Warren, for I

31
00:03:47,855 --> 00:03:53,355
 will have mercy on him; and, notwithstanding the

32
00:03:53,355 --> 00:03:58,855
 vanity of his heart, I will lift him up inasmuch as

33
00:03:58,855 --> 00:04:04,355
 he will humble himself before me

34
00:04:04,928 --> 00:04:10,928
8 And I will give him grace and assurance

35
00:04:10,928 --> 00:04:16,928
 wherewith he may stand; and if he continue to be a

36
00:04:16,928 --> 00:04:22,928
 faithful witness and a light unto the church I have

37
00:04:22,928 --> 00:04:28,928
 prepared a crown for him in the mansions of my Father.

38
00:04:28,928 --> 00:04:34,928
 Even so. Amen.
