1834. This revelation is directed to Warren A.

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Cowdery, an older brother of Oliver Cowdery. 
1–3,

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Warren A. Cowdery is called as a local

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
presiding officer; 
4–5, The Second Coming will not

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
overtake the children of light as a thief; 
6–8,

8
00:00:00,0 --> 01:16:56,
Great blessings follow faithful service in the Church. 

9
01:16:56,0 --> 01:16:56,0
1 It is my will that my servant Warren A.

10
01:16:56,0 --> 01:16:56,0
Cowdery should be appointed and ordained a

11
01:16:56,0 --> 01:16:56,0
presiding high priest over my church, in the

12
01:16:56,0 --> 01:39:57,
land of Freedom and the regions round about;

13
01:39:57,0 --> 01:39:57,0
2 And should preach my everlasting

14
01:39:57,0 --> 01:39:57,0
gospel, and lift up his voice and

15
01:39:57,0 --> 01:39:57,0
warn the people, not only in his own

16
01:39:57,0 --> 02:00:32,
place, but in the adjoining counties;

17
02:00:32,0 --> 02:00:32,0
3 And devote his whole time to

18
02:00:32,0 --> 02:00:32,0
this high and holy calling, which I

19
02:00:32,0 --> 02:00:32,0
now give unto him, seeking

20
02:00:32,0 --> 02:00:32,0
diligently the kingdom of heaven and its

21
02:00:32,0 --> 02:00:32,0
righteousness, and all things

22
02:00:32,0 --> 02:00:32,0
necessary shall be added thereunto; for

23
02:00:32,0 --> 02:07:35,
the laborer is worthy of his hire.

24
02:07:35,0 --> 02:07:35,0
4 And again, verily I say unto

25
02:07:35,0 --> 02:07:35,0
you, the coming of the Lord

26
02:07:35,0 --> 02:07:35,0
draweth nigh, and it overtaketh

27
02:07:35,0 --> 02:35:11,
the world as a thief in the night—

28
02:35:11,0 --> 02:35:11,0
5 Therefore, gird up your

29
02:35:11,0 --> 02:35:11,0
loins, that you may be the

30
02:35:11,0 --> 02:35:11,0
children of light, and that day

31
02:35:11,0 --> 02:46:11,
shall not overtake you as a thief.

32
02:46:11,0 --> 02:46:11,0
6 And again, verily I

33
02:46:11,0 --> 02:46:11,0
say unto you, there was

34
02:46:11,0 --> 02:46:11,0
joy in heaven when my

35
02:46:11,0 --> 02:46:11,0
servant Warren bowed to my

36
02:46:11,0 --> 02:46:11,0
scepter, and separated

37
02:46:11,0 --> 02:53:14,
himself from the crafts of men;

38
02:53:14,0 --> 02:53:14,0
7 Therefore, blessed

39
02:53:14,0 --> 02:53:14,0
is my servant Warren,

40
02:53:14,0 --> 02:53:14,0
for I will have mercy

41
02:53:14,0 --> 02:53:14,0
on him; and,

42
02:53:14,0 --> 02:53:14,0
notwithstanding the vanity of

43
02:53:14,0 --> 02:53:14,0
his heart, I will lift

44
02:53:14,0 --> 02:53:14,0
him up inasmuch as he

45
02:53:14,0 --> 03:12:13,
will humble himself before me.

46
03:12:13,0 --> 03:12:13,0
8 And I will give him

47
03:12:13,0 --> 03:12:13,0
grace and assurance

48
03:12:13,0 --> 03:12:13,0
wherewith he may

49
03:12:13,0 --> 03:12:13,0
stand; and if he continue

50
03:12:13,0 --> 03:12:13,0
to be a faithful

51
03:12:13,0 --> 03:12:13,0
witness and a light unto

52
03:12:13,0 --> 03:12:13,0
the church I have

53
03:12:13,0 --> 03:12:13,0
prepared a crown for

54
03:12:13,0 --> 03:12:13,0
him in the mansions of

55
03:12:13,0 --> 03:19:16,
my Father. Even so. Amen.
