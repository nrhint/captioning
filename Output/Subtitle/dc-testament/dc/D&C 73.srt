00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:16,878
Section 73 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:16,878 --> 00:00:22,478
 Prophet and Sidney Rigdon, at Hiram, Ohio, January

3
00:00:22,478 --> 00:00:28,078
 10, 1832. Since the early part of the preceding

4
00:00:28,078 --> 00:00:33,678
 December, the Prophet and Sidney had been engaged in

5
00:00:33,678 --> 00:00:39,278
 preaching, and by this means much was accomplished

6
00:00:39,278 --> 00:00:44,878
 in diminishing the unfavorable feelings that had

7
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:50,478
 arisen against the Church (see the 
heading to

8
00:00:50,478 --> 00:00:56,078
 section 71). 
1–2, Elders are to continue to preach;

9
00:00:56,078 --> 00:01:01,678
3–6, Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon are to

10
00:01:01,678 --> 00:01:07,278
 continue to translate the Bible until it is finished.

11
00:01:07,451 --> 00:01:12,201
1 For verily, thus saith the Lord, it is expedient

12
00:01:12,201 --> 00:01:16,951
 in me that they should continue preaching the

13
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:21,701
 gospel, and in exhortation to the churches in the

14
00:01:21,701 --> 00:01:26,451
 regions round about, until conference

15
00:01:26,737 --> 00:01:30,07
2 And then, behold, it shall be made known unto

16
00:01:30,07 --> 00:01:33,403
 them, by the voice of the conference, their several

17
00:01:33,403 --> 00:01:36,736
 missions

18
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:40,696
3 Now, verily I say unto you my servants, Joseph

19
00:01:40,696 --> 00:01:45,363
 Smith, Jun., and Sidney Rigdon, saith the Lord, it

20
00:01:45,363 --> 00:01:50,03
 is expedient to translate again

21
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:53,577
4 And, inasmuch as it is practicable, to preach in

22
00:01:53,577 --> 00:01:57,077
 the regions round about until conference; and

23
00:01:57,077 --> 00:02:00,577
 after that it is expedient to continue the work of

24
00:02:00,577 --> 00:02:04,077
 translation until it be finished

25
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:10,358
5 And let this be a pattern unto the elders until

26
00:02:10,358 --> 00:02:16,358
 further knowledge, even as it is written

27
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:23,903
6 Now I give no more unto you at this time. Gird

28
00:02:23,903 --> 00:02:30,903
 up your loins and be sober. Even so. Amen.
