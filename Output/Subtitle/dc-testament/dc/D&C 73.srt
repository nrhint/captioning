1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 73 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Prophet and Sidney Rigdon, at Hiram, Ohio, January

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
10, 1832. Since the early part of the preceding

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
December, the Prophet and Sidney had been engaged

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
in preaching, and by this means much was

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
accomplished in diminishing the unfavorable feelings

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
that had arisen against the Church (see the 
heading

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
to section 71). 
1–2, Elders are to continue to

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
preach; 
3–6, Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon are

10
00:00:00,0 --> 01:06:54,
to continue to translate the Bible until it is finished. 

11
01:06:54,0 --> 01:06:54,0
1 For verily, thus saith the Lord, it is

12
01:06:54,0 --> 01:06:54,0
expedient in me that they should continue preaching

13
01:06:54,0 --> 01:06:54,0
the gospel, and in exhortation to the

14
01:06:54,0 --> 01:13:56,
churches in the regions round about, until conference;

15
01:13:56,0 --> 01:13:56,0
2 And then, behold, it shall be made

16
01:13:56,0 --> 01:13:56,0
known unto them, by the voice of

17
01:13:56,0 --> 01:26:02,
the conference, their several missions.

18
01:26:02,0 --> 01:26:02,0
3 Now, verily I say unto you my

19
01:26:02,0 --> 01:26:02,0
servants, Joseph Smith, Jun., and

20
01:26:02,0 --> 01:26:02,0
Sidney Rigdon, saith the Lord, it

21
01:26:02,0 --> 01:27:06,
is expedient to translate again;

22
01:27:06,0 --> 01:27:06,0
4 And, inasmuch as it is

23
01:27:06,0 --> 01:27:06,0
practicable, to preach in the

24
01:27:06,0 --> 01:27:06,0
regions round about until

25
01:27:06,0 --> 01:27:06,0
conference; and after that it is

26
01:27:06,0 --> 01:27:06,0
expedient to continue the work of

27
01:27:06,0 --> 01:34:09,
translation until it be finished.

28
01:34:09,0 --> 01:34:09,0
5 And let this be a

29
01:34:09,0 --> 01:34:09,0
pattern unto the elders

30
01:34:09,0 --> 01:34:09,0
until further

31
01:34:09,0 --> 01:32:45,
knowledge, even as it is written.

32
01:32:45,0 --> 01:32:45,0
6 Now I give no

33
01:32:45,0 --> 01:32:45,0
more unto you at

34
01:32:45,0 --> 01:32:45,0
this time. Gird up

35
01:32:45,0 --> 01:32:45,0
your loins and be

36
01:32:45,0 --> 01:35:47,
sober. Even so. Amen.
