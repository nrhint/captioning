14
00:00:00,0 --> 03:47:11,
the Lord will deliver them from financial bondage. 

15
03:47:11,0 --> 03:47:11,0
1 Verily I say unto you, my friends, I give

16
03:47:11,0 --> 03:47:11,0
unto you counsel, and a commandment,

17
03:47:11,0 --> 03:47:11,0
concerning all the properties which belong to

18
03:47:11,0 --> 03:47:11,0
the order which I commanded to be organized

19
03:47:11,0 --> 03:47:11,0
and established, to be a united order, and

20
03:47:11,0 --> 03:47:11,0
an everlasting order for the benefit of my

21
03:47:11,0 --> 04:16:13,
church, and for the salvation of men until I come—

22
04:16:13,0 --> 04:16:13,0
2 With promise immutable and

23
04:16:13,0 --> 04:16:13,0
unchangeable, that inasmuch as those whom I

24
04:16:13,0 --> 04:16:13,0
commanded were faithful they should be

25
04:16:13,0 --> 04:37:16,
blessed with a multiplicity of blessings;

26
04:37:16,0 --> 04:37:16,0
3 But inasmuch as they were not

27
04:37:16,0 --> 04:39:20,
faithful they were nigh unto cursing.

28
04:39:20,0 --> 04:39:20,0
4 Therefore, inasmuch as some

29
04:39:20,0 --> 04:39:20,0
of my servants have not kept

30
04:39:20,0 --> 04:39:20,0
the commandment, but have

31
04:39:20,0 --> 04:39:20,0
broken the covenant through

32
04:39:20,0 --> 04:39:20,0
covetousness, and with feigned

33
04:39:20,0 --> 04:39:20,0
words, I have cursed them with

34
04:39:20,0 --> 04:42:59,
a very sore and grievous curse.

35
04:42:59,0 --> 04:42:59,0
5 For I, the Lord, have

36
04:42:59,0 --> 04:42:59,0
decreed in my heart, that

37
04:42:59,0 --> 04:42:59,0
inasmuch as any man

38
04:42:59,0 --> 04:42:59,0
belonging to the order shall be

39
04:42:59,0 --> 04:42:59,0
found a transgressor, or, in

40
04:42:59,0 --> 04:42:59,0
other words, shall break

41
04:42:59,0 --> 04:42:59,0
the covenant with which ye

42
04:42:59,0 --> 04:42:59,0
are bound, he shall be

43
04:42:59,0 --> 04:42:59,0
cursed in his life, and

44
04:42:59,0 --> 04:50:01,
shall be trodden down by whom I will;

45
04:50:01,0 --> 04:50:01,0
6 For I, the Lord,

46
04:50:01,0 --> 04:50:01,0
am not to be

47
04:50:01,0 --> 04:51:05,
mocked in these things—

48
04:51:05,0 --> 04:51:05,0
7 And all this

49
04:51:05,0 --> 04:51:05,0
that the innocent

50
04:51:05,0 --> 04:51:05,0
among you may not

51
04:51:05,0 --> 04:51:05,0
be condemned with

52
04:51:05,0 --> 04:51:05,0
the unjust; and

53
04:51:05,0 --> 04:51:05,0
that the guilty

54
04:51:05,0 --> 04:51:05,0
among you may not

55
04:51:05,0 --> 04:51:05,0
escape; because

56
04:51:05,0 --> 04:51:05,0
I, the Lord, have

57
04:51:05,0 --> 04:51:05,0
promised unto you

58
04:51:05,0 --> 04:51:05,0
a crown of glory

59
04:51:05,0 --> 04:58:08,
at my right hand.

60
04:58:08,0 --> 04:58:08,0
8 Therefore,

61
04:58:08,0 --> 04:58:08,0
inasmuch as you

62
04:58:08,0 --> 04:58:08,0
are found

63
04:58:08,0 --> 04:58:08,0
transgressors, you

64
04:58:08,0 --> 04:58:08,0
cannot escape my

65
04:58:08,0 --> 05:05:11,
wrath in your lives.

66
05:05:11,0 --> 05:05:11,0
9 Inasmuch as

67
05:05:11,0 --> 05:05:11,0
ye are cut off

68
05:05:11,0 --> 05:05:11,0
for

69
05:05:11,0 --> 05:05:11,0
transgression, ye

70
05:05:11,0 --> 05:05:11,0
cannot escape the

71
05:05:11,0 --> 05:05:11,0
buffetings of

72
05:05:11,0 --> 05:05:11,0
Satan until the

73
05:05:11,0 --> 05:23:43,
day of redemption.

74
05:23:43,0 --> 05:23:43,0
10 And I now

75
05:23:43,0 --> 05:23:43,0
give unto you

76
05:23:43,0 --> 05:23:43,0
power from

77
05:23:43,0 --> 05:23:43,0
this very

78
05:23:43,0 --> 05:23:43,0
hour, that if any

79
05:23:43,0 --> 05:23:43,0
man among

80
05:23:43,0 --> 05:23:43,0
you, of the

81
05:23:43,0 --> 05:23:43,0
order, is found

82
05:23:43,0 --> 05:23:43,0
a

83
05:23:43,0 --> 05:23:43,0
transgressor and

84
05:23:43,0 --> 05:23:43,0
repenteth not of the

85
05:23:43,0 --> 05:23:43,0
evil, that

86
05:23:43,0 --> 05:23:43,0
ye shall

87
05:23:43,0 --> 05:23:43,0
deliver him over

88
05:23:43,0 --> 05:23:43,0
unto the

89
05:23:43,0 --> 05:23:43,0
buffetings of

90
05:23:43,0 --> 05:23:43,0
Satan; and he

91
05:23:43,0 --> 05:23:43,0
shall not have

92
05:23:43,0 --> 05:30:46,
power to bring evil upon you.

93
05:30:46,0 --> 05:30:46,0
11 It is

94
05:30:46,0 --> 05:30:46,0
wisdom in me;

95
05:30:46,0 --> 05:30:46,0
therefore, a

96
05:30:46,0 --> 05:30:46,0
commandment

97
05:30:46,0 --> 05:30:46,0
I give unto

98
05:30:46,0 --> 05:30:46,0
you, that ye

99
05:30:46,0 --> 05:30:46,0
shall

100
05:30:46,0 --> 05:30:46,0
organize

101
05:30:46,0 --> 05:30:46,0
yourselves and

102
05:30:46,0 --> 05:30:46,0
appoint every man

103
05:30:46,0 --> 05:30:52,
his stewardship;

104
05:30:52,0 --> 05:30:52,0
12 That

105
05:30:52,0 --> 05:30:52,0
every man may

106
05:30:52,0 --> 05:30:52,0
give an

107
05:30:52,0 --> 05:30:52,0
account unto

108
05:30:52,0 --> 05:30:52,0
me of the

109
05:30:52,0 --> 05:30:52,0
stewardship

110
05:30:52,0 --> 05:30:52,0
which is

111
05:30:52,0 --> 05:30:58,
appointed unto him.

112
05:30:58,0 --> 05:30:58,0
13 For it

113
05:30:58,0 --> 05:30:58,0
is

114
05:30:58,0 --> 05:30:58,0
expedient that I,

115
05:30:58,0 --> 05:30:58,0
the Lord,

116
05:30:58,0 --> 05:30:58,0
should

117
05:30:58,0 --> 05:30:58,0
make every

118
05:30:58,0 --> 05:30:58,0
man

119
05:30:58,0 --> 05:30:58,0
accountable, as a

120
05:30:58,0 --> 05:30:58,0
steward

121
05:30:58,0 --> 05:30:58,0
over

122
05:30:58,0 --> 05:30:58,0
earthly

123
05:30:58,0 --> 05:30:58,0
blessings, which I

124
05:30:58,0 --> 05:30:58,0
have made

125
05:30:58,0 --> 05:30:58,0
and

126
05:30:58,0 --> 05:30:36,
prepared for my creatures.

127
05:30:36,0 --> 05:30:36,0
14 I, the

128
05:30:36,0 --> 05:30:36,0
Lord,

129
05:30:36,0 --> 05:30:36,0
stretched

130
05:30:36,0 --> 05:30:36,0
out the

131
05:30:36,0 --> 05:30:36,0
heavens,

132
05:30:36,0 --> 05:30:36,0
and built

133
05:30:36,0 --> 05:30:36,0
the earth,

134
05:30:36,0 --> 05:30:36,0
my very

135
05:30:36,0 --> 05:30:36,0


136
05:30:36,0 --> 05:30:36,0
handiwork; and all

137
05:30:36,0 --> 05:30:36,0
things

138
05:30:36,0 --> 05:29:40,
therein are mine.

139
05:29:40,0 --> 05:29:40,0
15 And

140
05:29:40,0 --> 05:29:40,0
it is my

141
05:29:40,0 --> 05:29:40,0
purpose

142
05:29:40,0 --> 05:29:40,0
to

143
05:29:40,0 --> 05:29:40,0
provide for

144
05:29:40,0 --> 05:29:40,0
my

145
05:29:40,0 --> 05:29:40,0
saints, for

146
05:29:40,0 --> 05:29:40,0
all things

147
05:29:40,0 --> 05:37:17,
are mine.

148
05:37:17,0 --> 05:37:17,0
16 But

149
05:37:17,0 --> 05:37:17,0
it must

150
05:37:17,0 --> 05:37:17,0
needs be

151
05:37:17,0 --> 05:37:17,0
done in

152
05:37:17,0 --> 05:37:17,0
mine own

153
05:37:17,0 --> 05:37:17,0
way;

154
05:37:17,0 --> 05:37:17,0
and behold

155
05:37:17,0 --> 05:37:17,0
this is

156
05:37:17,0 --> 05:37:17,0
the way

157
05:37:17,0 --> 05:37:17,0
that I,

158
05:37:17,0 --> 05:37:17,0
the

159
05:37:17,0 --> 05:37:17,0
Lord, have

160
05:37:17,0 --> 05:37:17,0
decreed

161
05:37:17,0 --> 05:37:17,0
to

162
05:37:17,0 --> 05:37:17,0
provide for

163
05:37:17,0 --> 05:37:17,0
my

164
05:37:17,0 --> 05:37:17,0
saints, that

165
05:37:17,0 --> 05:37:17,0
the poor

166
05:37:17,0 --> 05:37:17,0
shall be

167
05:37:17,0 --> 05:37:17,0


168
05:37:17,0 --> 05:37:17,0
exalted, in

169
05:37:17,0 --> 05:37:17,0
that the

170
05:37:17,0 --> 05:37:17,0
rich are

171
05:37:17,0 --> 05:36:21,
made low.

172
05:36:21,0 --> 05:36:21,0
17 For

173
05:36:21,0 --> 05:36:21,0
the

174
05:36:21,0 --> 05:36:21,0
earth is

175
05:36:21,0 --> 05:36:21,0
full,

176
05:36:21,0 --> 05:36:21,0
and there

177
05:36:21,0 --> 05:36:21,0
is

178
05:36:21,0 --> 05:36:21,0
enough and

179
05:36:21,0 --> 05:36:21,0
to

180
05:36:21,0 --> 05:36:21,0
spare;

181
05:36:21,0 --> 05:36:21,0
yea, I

182
05:36:21,0 --> 05:36:21,0
prepared

183
05:36:21,0 --> 05:36:21,0
all

184
05:36:21,0 --> 05:36:21,0
things, and

185
05:36:21,0 --> 05:36:21,0
have

186
05:36:21,0 --> 05:36:21,0
given

187
05:36:21,0 --> 05:36:21,0
unto the

188
05:36:21,0 --> 05:36:21,0


189
05:36:21,0 --> 05:36:21,0
children of

190
05:36:21,0 --> 05:36:21,0
men to be

191
05:36:21,0 --> 05:35:25,
agents unto themselves.

192
05:35:25,0 --> 05:35:25,0
18

193
05:35:25,0 --> 05:35:25,0


194
05:35:25,0 --> 05:35:25,0
Therefore, if

195
05:35:25,0 --> 05:35:25,0
any man

196
05:35:25,0 --> 05:35:25,0
shall

197
05:35:25,0 --> 05:35:25,0
take

198
05:35:25,0 --> 05:35:25,0
of the

199
05:35:25,0 --> 05:35:25,0


200
05:35:25,0 --> 05:35:25,0
abundance

201
05:35:25,0 --> 05:35:25,0
which I

202
05:35:25,0 --> 05:35:25,0
have

203
05:35:25,0 --> 05:35:25,0
made,

204
05:35:25,0 --> 05:35:25,0
and

205
05:35:25,0 --> 05:35:25,0
impart

206
05:35:25,0 --> 05:35:25,0
not his

208
05:35:25,0 --> 05:35:25,0
portion,

209
05:35:25,0 --> 05:35:25,0


210
05:35:25,0 --> 05:35:25,0
according to

211
05:35:25,0 --> 05:35:25,0
the law

212
05:35:25,0 --> 05:35:25,0
of my

213
05:35:25,0 --> 05:35:25,0


214
05:35:25,0 --> 05:35:25,0
gospel,

215
05:35:25,0 --> 05:35:25,0
unto the

216
05:35:25,0 --> 05:35:25,0
poor

217
05:35:25,0 --> 05:35:25,0
and the

218
05:35:25,0 --> 05:35:25,0


219
05:35:25,0 --> 05:35:25,0
needy, he

220
05:35:25,0 --> 05:35:25,0
shall,

221
05:35:25,0 --> 05:35:25,0
with

222
05:35:25,0 --> 05:35:25,0
the

223
05:35:25,0 --> 05:35:25,0
wicked,

224
05:35:25,0 --> 05:35:25,0
lift up

225
05:35:25,0 --> 05:39:04,
his eyes in hell, being in torment.

226

An earlier meeting of the firm on April 10 had resolved that the organization be dissolved. This revelation directs that the firm instead be reorganized; its properties were to be divided among members of the firm as their stewardships. Under Joseph Smith’s direction, the phrase “United Firm” was later replaced with “United Order” in the revelation.
