 financial bondage.

15
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:52,08
1 Verily I say unto you, my friends, I give unto

16
00:03:52,08 --> 00:03:56,366
 you counsel, and a commandment, concerning all the

17
00:03:56,366 --> 00:04:00,652
 properties which belong to the order which I

18
00:04:00,652 --> 00:04:04,938
 commanded to be organized and established, to be a

19
00:04:04,938 --> 00:04:09,224
 united order, and an everlasting order for the benefit

20
00:04:09,224 --> 00:04:13,51
 of my church, and for the salvation of men until

21
00:04:13,51 --> 00:04:17,796
 I come

22
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:22,541
2 With promise immutable and unchangeable, that

23
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:27,541
 inasmuch as those whom I commanded were faithful

24
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:32,541
 they should be blessed with a multiplicity of

25
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:37,541
 blessings

26
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:40,043
3 But inasmuch as they were not faithful they were

27
00:04:40,043 --> 00:04:43,043
 nigh unto cursing

28
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:48,417
4 Therefore, inasmuch as some of my servants have

29
00:04:48,417 --> 00:04:53,017
 not kept the commandment, but have broken the

30
00:04:53,017 --> 00:04:57,617
 covenant through covetousness, and with feigned words,

31
00:04:57,617 --> 00:05:02,217
 I have cursed them with a very sore and grievous

32
00:05:02,217 --> 00:05:06,817
 curse

33
00:05:06,823 --> 00:05:11,323
5 For I, the Lord, have decreed in my heart, that

34
00:05:11,323 --> 00:05:15,823
 inasmuch as any man belonging to the order shall

35
00:05:15,823 --> 00:05:20,323
 be found a transgressor, or, in other words, shall

36
00:05:20,323 --> 00:05:24,823
 break the covenant with which ye are bound, he

37
00:05:24,823 --> 00:05:29,323
 shall be cursed in his life, and shall be trodden

38
00:05:29,323 --> 00:05:33,823
 down by whom I will

39
00:05:33,817 --> 00:05:36,817
6 For I, the Lord, am not to be mocked in these

40
00:05:36,817 --> 00:05:39,817
 things

41
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:44,789
7 And all this that the innocent among you may not

42
00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:49,989
 be condemned with the unjust; and that the guilty

43
00:05:49,989 --> 00:05:55,189
 among you may not escape; because I, the Lord,

44
00:05:55,189 --> 00:06:00,389
 have promised unto you a crown of glory at my right

45
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:05,589
 hand

46
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:11,865
8 Therefore, inasmuch as you are found

47
00:06:11,865 --> 00:06:17,865
 transgressors, you cannot escape my wrath in your lives

48
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:22,544
9 Inasmuch as ye are cut off for transgression, ye

49
00:06:22,544 --> 00:06:27,212
 cannot escape the buffetings of Satan until the

50
00:06:27,212 --> 00:06:31,878
 day of redemption

51
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:36,208
10 And I now give unto you power from this very

52
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:40,541
 hour, that if any man among you, of the order, is

53
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:44,874
 found a transgressor and repenteth not of the evil,

54
00:06:44,874 --> 00:06:49,207
 that ye shall deliver him over unto the buffetings

55
00:06:49,207 --> 00:06:53,54
 of Satan; and he shall not have power to bring

56
00:06:53,54 --> 00:06:57,873
 evil upon you

57
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:02,918
11 It is wisdom in me; therefore, a commandment I

58
00:07:02,918 --> 00:07:07,918
 give unto you, that ye shall organize yourselves

59
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:12,918
 and appoint every man his stewardship

60
00:07:12,215 --> 00:07:17,215
12 That every man may give an account unto me of

61
00:07:17,215 --> 00:07:22,215
 the stewardship which is appointed unto him

62
00:07:22,225 --> 00:07:26,475
13 For it is expedient that I, the Lord, should

63
00:07:26,475 --> 00:07:30,725
 make every man accountable, as a steward over

64
00:07:30,725 --> 00:07:34,975
 earthly blessings, which I have made and prepared for my

65
00:07:34,975 --> 00:07:39,225
 creatures

66
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:43,009
14 I, the Lord, stretched out the heavens, and

67
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:47,009
 built the earth, my very handiwork; and all things

68
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:51,009
 therein are mine

69
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:55,071
15 And it is my purpose to provide for my saints,

70
00:07:55,071 --> 00:07:59,071
 for all things are mine

71
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:03,812
16 But it must needs be done in mine own way; and

72
00:08:03,812 --> 00:08:08,562
 behold this is the way that I, the Lord, have

73
00:08:08,562 --> 00:08:13,312
 decreed to provide for my saints, that the poor shall

74
00:08:13,312 --> 00:08:18,062
 be exalted, in that the rich are made low

75
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:23,081
17 For the earth is full, and there is enough and

76
00:08:23,081 --> 00:08:27,831
 to spare; yea, I prepared all things, and have

77
00:08:27,831 --> 00:08:32,581
 given unto the children of men to be agents unto

78
00:08:32,581 --> 00:08:37,331
 themselves

79
00:08:37,834 --> 00:08:43,234
18 Therefore, if any man shall take of the

80
00:08:43,234 --> 00:08:48,634
 abundance which I have made, and impart not his portion,

81
00:08:48,634 --> 00:08:54,034
 according to the law of my gospel, unto the poor

82
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:59,434
 and the needy, he shall, with the wicked, lift up

83
00:08:59,434 --> 00:09:04,834
 his eyes in hell, being in torment

84
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:08,844
19 And now, verily I say unto you, concerning the

85
00:09:08,844 --> 00:09:13,344
 properties of the order

86
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,236
20 Let my servant Sidney Rigdon have appointed

87
00:09:15,236 --> 00:09:16,836
 unto him the place where he now resides, and the lot

88
00:09:16,836 --> 00:09:18,436
 of the tannery for his stewardship, for his

89
00:09:18,436 --> 00:09:20,036
 support while he is laboring in my vineyard, even as I

90
00:09:20,036 --> 00:09:21,636
 will, when I shall command him

91
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:35,295
21 And let all things be done according to the

92
00:09:35,295 --> 00:09:48,962
 counsel of the order, and united consent or voice of

93
00:09:48,962 --> 00:10:02,629
 the order, which dwell in the land of Kirtland

94
00:10:02,886 --> 00:10:07,219
22 And this stewardship and blessing, I, the Lord,

95
00:10:07,219 --> 00:10:11,552
 confer upon my servant Sidney Rigdon for a

96
00:10:11,552 --> 00:10:15,885
 blessing upon him, and his seed after him

97
00:10:15,932 --> 00:10:19,932
23 And I will multiply blessings upon him,

98
00:10:19,932 --> 00:10:23,932
 inasmuch as he will be humble before me

99
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:29,157
24 And again, let my servant Martin Harris have

100
00:10:29,157 --> 00:10:34,357
 appointed unto him, for his stewardship, the lot of

101
00:10:34,357 --> 00:10:39,557
 land which my servant John Johnson obtained in

102
00:10:39,557 --> 00:10:44,757
 exchange for his former inheritance, for him and his

103
00:10:44,757 --> 00:10:49,957
 seed after him

104
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:53,949
25 And inasmuch as he is faithful, I will multiply

105
00:10:53,949 --> 00:10:57,949
 blessings upon him and his seed after him

106
00:10:57,707 --> 00:11:03,374
26 And let my servant Martin Harris devote his

107
00:11:03,374 --> 00:11:09,041
 moneys for the proclaiming of my words, according as

108
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:14,708
 my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., shall direct

109
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:20,007
27 And again, let my servant Frederick G. Williams

110
00:11:20,007 --> 00:11:26,007
 have the place upon which he now dwells

111
00:11:26,035 --> 00:11:32,035
28 And let my servant Oliver Cowdery have the lot

112
00:11:32,035 --> 00:11:38,035
 which is set off joining the house, which is to be

113
00:11:38,035 --> 00:11:44,035
 for the printing office, which is lot number one,

114
00:11:44,035 --> 00:11:50,035
 and also the lot upon which his father resides

115
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:55,91
29 And let my servants Frederick G. Williams and

116
00:11:55,91 --> 00:12:01,243
 Oliver Cowdery have the printing office and all

117
00:12:01,243 --> 00:12:06,576
 things that pertain unto it

118
00:12:06,876 --> 00:12:09,876
30 And this shall be their stewardship which shall

119
00:12:09,876 --> 00:12:12,876
 be appointed unto them

120
00:12:12,882 --> 00:12:16,382
31 And inasmuch as they are faithful, behold I

121
00:12:16,382 --> 00:12:19,882
 will bless, and multiply blessings upon them

122
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,989
32 And this is the beginning of the stewardship

123
00:12:22,989 --> 00:12:26,322
 which I have appointed them, for them and their seed

124
00:12:26,322 --> 00:12:29,655
 after them

125
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:34,282
33 And, inasmuch as they are faithful, I will

126
00:12:34,282 --> 00:12:38,615
 multiply blessings upon them and their seed after

127
00:12:38,615 --> 00:12:42,948
 them, even a multiplicity of blessings

128
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:48,396
34 And again, let my servant John Johnson have the

129
00:12:48,396 --> 00:12:54,063
 house in which he lives, and the inheritance, all

130
00:12:54,063 --> 00:12:59,73
 save the ground which has been reserved for the

131
00:12:59,73 --> 00:13:05,397
 building of my houses, which pertains to that

132
00:13:05,397 --> 00:13:11,064
 inheritance, and those lots which have been named for

133
00:13:11,064 --> 00:13:16,731
 my servant Oliver Cowdery

134
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:19,229
35 And inasmuch as he is faithful, I will multiply

135
00:13:19,229 --> 00:13:22,229
 blessings upon him

136
00:13:22,518 --> 00:13:27,351
36 And it is my will that he should sell the lots

137
00:13:27,351 --> 00:13:32,184
 that are laid off for the building up of the city

138
00:13:32,184 --> 00:13:37,017
 of my saints, inasmuch as it shall be made known

139
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:41,85
 to him by the voice of the Spirit, and according to

140
00:13:41,85 --> 00:13:46,683
 the counsel of the order, and by the voice of the

141
00:13:46,683 --> 00:13:51,516
 order

142
00:13:51,03 --> 00:13:54,697
37 And this is the beginning of the stewardship

143
00:13:54,697 --> 00:13:58,364
 which I have appointed unto him, for a blessing unto

144
00:13:58,364 --> 00:14:02,031
 him and his seed after him

145
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:06,808
38 And inasmuch as he is faithful, I will multiply

146
00:14:06,808 --> 00:14:11,308
 a multiplicity of blessings upon him

147
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:19,207
39 And again, let my servant Newel K. Whitney have

148
00:14:19,207 --> 00:14:27,065
 appointed unto him the houses and lot where he

149
00:14:27,065 --> 00:14:34,922
 now resides, and the lot and building on which the

150
00:14:34,922 --> 00:14:42,779
 mercantile establishment stands, and also the lot

151
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:50,635
 which is on the corner south of the mercantile

152
00:14:50,635 --> 00:14:58,493
 establishment, and also the lot on which the ashery is

153
00:14:58,493 --> 00:15:06,35
 situated

154
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:10,572
40 And all this I have appointed unto my servant

155
00:15:10,572 --> 00:15:15,072
 Newel K. Whitney for his stewardship, for a

156
00:15:15,072 --> 00:15:19,572
 blessing upon him and his seed after him, for the benefit

157
00:15:19,572 --> 00:15:24,072
 of the mercantile establishment of my order which

158
00:15:24,072 --> 00:15:28,572
 I have established for my stake in the land of

159
00:15:28,572 --> 00:15:33,072
 Kirtland

160
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:38,566
41 Yea, verily, this is the stewardship which I

161
00:15:38,566 --> 00:15:43,566
 have appointed unto my servant N. K. Whitney, even

162
00:15:43,566 --> 00:15:48,566
 this whole mercantile establishment, him and his

163
00:15:48,566 --> 00:15:53,566
 agent, and his seed after him

164
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:57,569
42 And inasmuch as he is faithful in keeping my

165
00:15:57,569 --> 00:16:01,819
 commandments, which I have given unto him, I will

166
00:16:01,819 --> 00:16:06,069
 multiply blessings upon him and his seed after him,

167
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:10,319
 even a multiplicity of blessings

168
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:17,037
43 And again, let my servant Joseph Smith, Jun.,

169
00:16:17,037 --> 00:16:23,237
 have appointed unto him the lot which is laid off

170
00:16:23,237 --> 00:16:29,437
 for the building of my house, which is forty rods

171
00:16:29,437 --> 00:16:35,637
 long and twelve wide, and also the inheritance upon

172
00:16:35,637 --> 00:16:41,837
 which his father now resides

173
00:16:41,817 --> 00:16:45,15
44 And this is the beginning of the stewardship

174
00:16:45,15 --> 00:16:48,483
 which I have appointed unto him, for a blessing upon

175
00:16:48,483 --> 00:16:51,816
 him, and upon his father

176
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:55,594
45 For behold, I have reserved an inheritance for

177
00:16:55,594 --> 00:16:59,844
 his father, for his support; therefore he shall be

178
00:16:59,844 --> 00:17:04,094
 reckoned in the house of my servant Joseph Smith,

179
00:17:04,094 --> 00:17:08,344
 Jun

180
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:13,961
46 And I will multiply blessings upon the house of

181
00:17:13,961 --> 00:17:19,294
 my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., inasmuch as he is

182
00:17:19,294 --> 00:17:24,627
 faithful, even a multiplicity of blessings

183
00:17:24,927 --> 00:17:29,927
47 And now, a commandment I give unto you

184
00:17:29,927 --> 00:17:34,927
 concerning Zion, that you shall no longer be bound as a

185
00:17:34,927 --> 00:17:39,927
 united order to your brethren of Zion, only on this

186
00:17:39,927 --> 00:17:44,927
 wise

187
00:17:44,914 --> 00:17:52,314
48 After you are organized, you shall be called

188
00:17:52,314 --> 00:17:59,714
 the United Order of the Stake of Zion, the City of

189
00:17:59,714 --> 00:18:07,114
 Kirtland. And your brethren, after they are

190
00:18:07,114 --> 00:18:14,514
 organized, shall be called the United Order of the City

191
00:18:14,514 --> 00:18:21,914
 of Zion

192
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:26,516
49 And they shall be organized in their own names,

193
00:18:26,516 --> 00:18:31,849
 and in their own name; and they shall do their

194
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:37,182
 business in their own name, and in their own names

195
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:42,967
50 And you shall do your business in your own

196
00:18:42,967 --> 00:18:47,967
 name, and in your own names

197
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:51,743
51 And this I have commanded to be done for your

198
00:18:51,743 --> 00:18:55,993
 salvation, and also for their salvation, in

199
00:18:55,993 --> 00:19:00,243
 consequence of their being driven out and that which is

200
00:19:00,243 --> 00:19:04,493
 to come

201
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:12,277
52 The covenants being broken through

202
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:19,777
 transgression, by covetousness and feigned words

203
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:25,725
53 Therefore, you are dissolved as a united order

204
00:19:25,725 --> 00:19:32,392
 with your brethren, that you are not bound only up

205
00:19:32,392 --> 00:19:39,059
 to this hour unto them, only on this wise, as I

206
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:45,726
 said, by loan as shall be agreed by this order in

207
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:52,393
 council, as your circumstances will admit and the

208
00:19:52,393 --> 00:19:59,06
 voice of the council direct

209
00:19:59,014 --> 00:20:01,681
54 And again, a commandment I give unto you

210
00:20:01,681 --> 00:20:04,348
 concerning your stewardship which I have appointed unto

211
00:20:04,348 --> 00:20:07,015
 you

212
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:11,807
55 Behold, all these properties are mine, or else

213
00:20:11,807 --> 00:20:15,807
 your faith is vain, and ye are found hypocrites,

214
00:20:15,807 --> 00:20:19,807
 and the covenants which ye have made unto me are

215
00:20:19,807 --> 00:20:23,807
 broken

216
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:29,822
56 And if the properties are mine, then ye are

217
00:20:29,822 --> 00:20:36,322
 stewards; otherwise ye are no stewards

218
00:20:36,102 --> 00:20:40,769
57 But, verily I say unto you, I have appointed

219
00:20:40,769 --> 00:20:45,436
 unto you to be stewards over mine house, even

220
00:20:45,436 --> 00:20:50,103
 stewards indeed

221
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:55,616
58 And for this purpose I have commanded you to

222
00:20:55,616 --> 00:21:00,616
 organize yourselves, even to print my words, the

223
00:21:00,616 --> 00:21:05,616
 fulness of my scriptures, the revelations which I

224
00:21:05,616 --> 00:21:10,616
 have given unto you, and which I shall, hereafter,

225
00:21:10,616 --> 00:21:15,616
 from time to time give unto you

226
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:19,391
59 For the purpose of building up my church and

227
00:21:19,391 --> 00:21:23,641
 kingdom on the earth, and to prepare my people for

228
00:21:23,641 --> 00:21:27,891
 the time when I shall dwell with them, which is

229
00:21:27,891 --> 00:21:32,141
 nigh at hand

230
00:21:32,158 --> 00:21:37,658
60 And ye shall prepare for yourselves a place for

231
00:21:37,658 --> 00:21:43,158
 a treasury, and consecrate it unto my name

232
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,919
61 And ye shall appoint one among you to keep the

233
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:49,919
 treasury, and he shall be ordained unto this

234
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,919
 blessing

235
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:57,111
62 And there shall be a seal upon the treasury,

236
00:21:57,111 --> 00:22:01,511
 and all the sacred things shall be delivered into

237
00:22:01,511 --> 00:22:05,911
 the treasury; and no man among you shall call it his

238
00:22:05,911 --> 00:22:10,311
 own, or any part of it, for it shall belong to

239
00:22:10,311 --> 00:22:14,711
 you all with one accord

240
00:22:14,984 --> 00:22:20,584
63 And I give it unto you from this very hour; and

241
00:22:20,584 --> 00:22:26,184
 now see to it, that ye go to and make use of the

242
00:22:26,184 --> 00:22:31,784
 stewardship which I have appointed unto you,

243
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:37,384
 exclusive of the sacred things, for the purpose of

244
00:22:37,384 --> 00:22:42,984
 printing these sacred things as I have said

245
00:22:42,478 --> 00:22:47,645
64 And the avails of the sacred things shall be

246
00:22:47,645 --> 00:22:52,812
 had in the treasury, and a seal shall be upon it;

247
00:22:52,812 --> 00:22:57,979
 and it shall not be used or taken out of the

248
00:22:57,979 --> 00:23:03,146
 treasury by any one, neither shall the seal be loosed

249
00:23:03,146 --> 00:23:08,313
 which shall be placed upon it, only by the voice of

250
00:23:08,313 --> 00:23:13,48
 the order, or by commandment

251
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:18,393
65 And thus shall ye preserve the avails of the

252
00:23:18,393 --> 00:23:23,06
 sacred things in the treasury, for sacred and holy

253
00:23:23,06 --> 00:23:27,727
 purposes

254
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:32,239
66 And this shall be called the sacred treasury of

255
00:23:32,239 --> 00:23:37,239
 the Lord; and a seal shall be kept upon it that

256
00:23:37,239 --> 00:23:42,239
 it may be holy and consecrated unto the Lord

257
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:48,171
67 And again, there shall be another treasury

258
00:23:48,171 --> 00:23:53,838
 prepared, and a treasurer appointed to keep the

259
00:23:53,838 --> 00:23:59,505
 treasury, and a seal shall be placed upon it

260
00:23:59,305 --> 00:24:04,305
68 And all moneys that you receive in your

261
00:24:04,305 --> 00:24:09,305
 stewardships, by improving upon the properties which I

262
00:24:09,305 --> 00:24:14,305
 have appointed unto you, in houses, or in lands, or

263
00:24:14,305 --> 00:24:19,305
 in cattle, or in all things save it be the holy

264
00:24:19,305 --> 00:24:24,305
 and sacred writings, which I have reserved unto

265
00:24:24,305 --> 00:24:29,305
 myself for holy and sacred purposes, shall be cast

266
00:24:29,305 --> 00:24:34,305
 into the treasury as fast as you receive moneys, by

267
00:24:34,305 --> 00:24:39,305
 hundreds, or by fifties, or by twenties, or by

268
00:24:39,305 --> 00:24:44,305
 tens, or by fives

269
00:24:44,55 --> 00:24:48,8
69 Or in other words, if any man among you obtain

270
00:24:48,8 --> 00:24:53,05
 five dollars let him cast them into the treasury;

271
00:24:53,05 --> 00:24:57,3
 or if he obtain ten, or twenty, or fifty, or an

272
00:24:57,3 --> 00:25:01,55
 hundred, let him do likewise

273
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:04,416
70 And let not any among you say that it is his

274
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:07,749
 own; for it shall not be called his, nor any part of

275
00:25:07,749 --> 00:25:11,082
 it

276
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:16,76
71 And there shall not any part of it be used, or

277
00:25:16,76 --> 00:25:22,427
 taken out of the treasury, only by the voice and

278
00:25:22,427 --> 00:25:28,094
 common consent of the order

279
00:25:28,377 --> 00:25:33,127
72 And this shall be the voice and common consent

280
00:25:33,127 --> 00:25:37,877
 of the order—that any man among you say to the

281
00:25:37,877 --> 00:25:42,627
 treasurer: I have need of this to help me in my

282
00:25:42,627 --> 00:25:47,377
 stewardship

283
00:25:47,88 --> 00:25:51,88
73 If it be five dollars, or if it be ten dollars,

284
00:25:51,88 --> 00:25:55,88
 or twenty, or fifty, or a hundred, the treasurer

285
00:25:55,88 --> 00:25:59,88
 shall give unto him the sum which he requires to

286
00:25:59,88 --> 00:26:03,88
 help him in his stewardship

287
00:26:03,629 --> 00:26:10,296
74 Until he be found a transgressor, and it is

288
00:26:10,296 --> 00:26:16,963
 manifest before the council of the order plainly that

289
00:26:16,963 --> 00:26:23,63
 he is an unfaithful and an unwise steward

290
00:26:23,132 --> 00:26:31,132
75 But so long as he is in full fellowship, and is

291
00:26:31,132 --> 00:26:39,132
 faithful and wise in his stewardship, this shall

292
00:26:39,132 --> 00:26:47,132
 be his token unto the treasurer that the treasurer

293
00:26:47,132 --> 00:26:55,132
 shall not withhold

294
00:26:55,097 --> 00:26:55,097
76 But in case of transgression, the treasurer

295
00:26:55,097 --> 00:26:55,097
 shall be subject unto the council and voice of the

296
00:26:55,097 --> 00:26:55,097
 order

297
00:26:55,43 --> 00:27:00,03
77 And in case the treasurer is found an

298
00:27:00,03 --> 00:27:04,63
 unfaithful and an unwise steward, he shall be subject to

299
00:27:04,63 --> 00:27:09,23
 the council and voice of the order, and shall be

300
00:27:09,23 --> 00:27:13,83
 removed out of his place, and another shall be

301
00:27:13,83 --> 00:27:18,43
 appointed in his stead

302
00:27:18,921 --> 00:27:22,921
78 And again, verily I say unto you, concerning

303
00:27:22,921 --> 00:27:26,921
 your debts—behold it is my will that you shall pay

304
00:27:26,921 --> 00:27:30,921
 all your debts

305
00:27:30,199 --> 00:27:34,866
79 And it is my will that you shall humble

306
00:27:34,866 --> 00:27:39,533
 yourselves before me, and obtain this blessing by your

307
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:44,2
 diligence and humility and the prayer of faith

308
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:48,763
80 And inasmuch as you are diligent and humble,

309
00:27:48,763 --> 00:27:52,563
 and exercise the prayer of faith, behold, I will

310
00:27:52,563 --> 00:27:56,363
 soften the hearts of those to whom you are in debt,

311
00:27:56,363 --> 00:28:00,163
 until I shall send means unto you for your

312
00:28:00,163 --> 00:28:03,963
 deliverance

313
00:28:03,966 --> 00:28:08,966
81 Therefore write speedily to New York and write

314
00:28:08,966 --> 00:28:13,966
 according to that which shall be dictated by my

315
00:28:13,966 --> 00:28:18,966
 Spirit; and I will soften the hearts of those to

316
00:28:18,966 --> 00:28:23,966
 whom you are in debt, that it shall be taken away out

317
00:28:23,966 --> 00:28:28,966
 of their minds to bring affliction upon you

318
00:28:28,257 --> 00:28:31,59
82 And inasmuch as ye are humble and faithful and

319
00:28:31,59 --> 00:28:34,923
 call upon my name, behold, I will give you the

320
00:28:34,923 --> 00:28:38,256
 victory

321
00:28:38,033 --> 00:28:42,033
83 I give unto you a promise, that you shall be

322
00:28:42,033 --> 00:28:46,033
 delivered this once out of your bondage

323
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:51,575
84 Inasmuch as you obtain a chance to loan money

324
00:28:51,575 --> 00:28:56,325
 by hundreds, or thousands, even until you shall

325
00:28:56,325 --> 00:29:01,075
 loan enough to deliver yourself from bondage, it is

326
00:29:01,075 --> 00:29:05,825
 your privilege

327
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:11,577
85 And pledge the properties which I have put into

328
00:29:11,577 --> 00:29:17,327
 your hands, this once, by giving your names by

329
00:29:17,327 --> 00:29:23,077
 common consent or otherwise, as it shall seem good

330
00:29:23,077 --> 00:29:28,827
 unto you

331
00:00:11,278 --> 00:01:24,611
Section 104 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

332
00:01:24,611 --> 00:02:37,944
 Prophet, at or near Kirtland, Ohio, April 23, 1834,

333
00:02:37,944 --> 00:03:51,277
 concerning the United Firm (see the

334
00:03:51,748 --> 00:03:51,848
82). The occasion was likely that of a council

335
00:03:51,848 --> 00:03:51,948
 meeting of members of the United Firm, which

336
00:03:51,948 --> 00:03:52,048
 discussed the pressing temporal needs of the Church. An

337
00:03:52,048 --> 00:03:52,148
 earlier meeting of the firm on April 10 had resolved

338
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:52,248
 that the organization be dissolved. This

339
00:03:52,248 --> 00:03:52,348
 revelation directs that the firm instead be reorganized;

340
00:03:52,348 --> 00:03:52,448
 its properties were to be divided among members of

341
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:52,548
 the firm as their stewardships. Under Joseph

342
00:03:52,548 --> 00:03:52,648
 Smith’s direction, the phrase “United Firm” was later

343
00:03:52,648 --> 00:03:52,748
 replaced with “United Order” in the revelation.
