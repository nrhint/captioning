00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 93 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, May 6, 1833.

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
1–5, All who are faithful will see the Lord; 
6–18,

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
John bore record that the Son of God went from

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
grace to grace until He received a fulness of the

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
glory of the Father; 
19–20, Faithful men, going

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
from grace to grace, will also receive of His

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
fulness; 
21–22, Those who are begotten through

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Christ are the Church of the Firstborn; 
23–28, Christ

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
received a fulness of all truth, and man by

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
obedience may do likewise; 
29–32, Man was in the

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
beginning with God; 
33–35, The elements are

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
eternal, and man may receive a fulness of joy in the

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Resurrection; 
36–37, The glory of God is

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
intelligence; 
38–40, Children are innocent before God

16
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
because of the redemption of Christ; 
41–53, The

17
00:00:00,0 --> 02:44:45,
leading brethren are commanded to set their families in order. 

18
02:44:45,0 --> 02:44:45,0
1 Verily, thus saith the Lord: It shall come

19
02:44:45,0 --> 02:44:45,0
to pass that every soul who forsaketh his

20
02:44:45,0 --> 02:44:45,0
sins and cometh unto me, and calleth on my

21
02:44:45,0 --> 02:44:45,0
name, and obeyeth my voice, and keepeth my

22
02:44:45,0 --> 02:44:23,
commandments, shall see my face and know that I am;

23
02:44:23,0 --> 02:44:23,0
2 And that I am the true light that

24
02:44:23,0 --> 02:40:03,
lighteth every man that cometh into the world;

25
02:40:03,0 --> 02:40:03,0
3 And that I am in the Father, and the

26
02:40:03,0 --> 02:45:08,
Father in me, and the Father and I are one—

27
02:45:08,0 --> 02:45:08,0
4 The Father because he gave me of

28
02:45:08,0 --> 02:45:08,0
his fulness, and the Son because I was

29
02:45:08,0 --> 02:45:08,0
in the world and made flesh my

30
02:45:08,0 --> 02:44:46,
tabernacle, and dwelt among the sons of men.

31
02:44:46,0 --> 02:44:46,0
5 I was in the world and

32
02:44:46,0 --> 02:44:46,0
received of my Father, and the

33
02:44:46,0 --> 02:44:24,
works of him were plainly manifest.

34
02:44:24,0 --> 02:44:24,0
6 And John saw and bore record

35
02:44:24,0 --> 02:44:24,0
of the fulness of my glory,

36
02:44:24,0 --> 02:44:24,0
and the fulness of John’s

37
02:44:24,0 --> 02:40:04,
record is hereafter to be revealed.

38
02:40:04,0 --> 02:40:04,0
7 And he bore record,

39
02:40:04,0 --> 02:40:04,0
saying: I saw his glory,

40
02:40:04,0 --> 02:40:04,0
that he was in the

41
02:40:04,0 --> 02:45:09,
beginning, before the world was;

42
02:45:09,0 --> 02:45:09,0
8 Therefore, in the

43
02:45:09,0 --> 02:45:09,0
beginning the Word

44
02:45:09,0 --> 02:45:09,0
was, for he was

45
02:45:09,0 --> 02:45:09,0
the Word, even the

46
02:45:09,0 --> 02:44:47,
messenger of salvation—

47
02:44:47,0 --> 02:44:47,0
9 The light and

48
02:44:47,0 --> 02:44:47,0
the Redeemer of

49
02:44:47,0 --> 02:44:47,0
the world; the

50
02:44:47,0 --> 02:44:47,0
Spirit of truth, who

51
02:44:47,0 --> 02:44:47,0
came into the

52
02:44:47,0 --> 02:44:47,0
world, because the

53
02:44:47,0 --> 02:44:47,0
world was made by

54
02:44:47,0 --> 02:44:47,0
him, and in him

55
02:44:47,0 --> 02:44:47,0
was the life of

56
02:44:47,0 --> 02:44:25,
men and the light of men.

57
02:44:25,0 --> 02:44:25,0
10 The worlds

58
02:44:25,0 --> 02:44:25,0
were made by

59
02:44:25,0 --> 02:44:25,0
him; men were made

60
02:44:25,0 --> 02:44:25,0
by him; all

61
02:44:25,0 --> 02:44:25,0
things were made

62
02:44:25,0 --> 02:44:25,0
by him, and

63
02:44:25,0 --> 02:40:05,
through him, and of him.

64
02:40:05,0 --> 02:40:05,0
11 And I,

65
02:40:05,0 --> 02:40:05,0
John, bear record

66
02:40:05,0 --> 02:40:05,0
that I beheld

67
02:40:05,0 --> 02:40:05,0
his glory, as

68
02:40:05,0 --> 02:40:05,0
the glory of

69
02:40:05,0 --> 02:40:05,0
the Only

70
02:40:05,0 --> 02:40:05,0
Begotten of the

71
02:40:05,0 --> 02:40:05,0
Father, full of

72
02:40:05,0 --> 02:40:05,0
grace and truth,

73
02:40:05,0 --> 02:40:05,0
even the

74
02:40:05,0 --> 02:40:05,0
Spirit of truth,

75
02:40:05,0 --> 02:40:05,0
which came and

76
02:40:05,0 --> 02:40:05,0
dwelt in the

77
02:40:05,0 --> 02:45:10,
flesh, and dwelt among us.

78
02:45:10,0 --> 02:45:10,0
12 And I,

79
02:45:10,0 --> 02:45:10,0
John, saw that

80
02:45:10,0 --> 02:45:10,0
he received

81
02:45:10,0 --> 02:45:10,0
not of the

82
02:45:10,0 --> 02:45:10,0
fulness at

83
02:45:10,0 --> 02:45:10,0
the first,

84
02:45:10,0 --> 02:45:10,0
but received

85
02:45:10,0 --> 02:46:14,
grace for grace;

86
02:46:14,0 --> 02:46:14,0
13 And he

87
02:46:14,0 --> 02:46:14,0
received not

88
02:46:14,0 --> 02:46:14,0
of the

89
02:46:14,0 --> 02:46:14,0
fulness at

90
02:46:14,0 --> 02:46:14,0
first, but

91
02:46:14,0 --> 02:46:14,0
continued from

92
02:46:14,0 --> 02:46:14,0
grace to

93
02:46:14,0 --> 02:46:14,0
grace, until

94
02:46:14,0 --> 02:46:14,0
he

95
02:46:14,0 --> 02:53:16,
received a fulness;

96
02:53:16,0 --> 02:53:16,0
14 And

97
02:53:16,0 --> 02:53:16,0
thus he was

98
02:53:16,0 --> 02:53:16,0
called the

99
02:53:16,0 --> 02:53:16,0
Son of

100
02:53:16,0 --> 02:53:16,0
God, because

101
02:53:16,0 --> 02:53:16,0
he

102
02:53:16,0 --> 02:53:16,0
received not of

103
02:53:16,0 --> 02:53:16,0
the fulness

104
02:53:16,0 --> 03:00:18,
at the first.

105
03:00:18,0 --> 03:00:18,0
15 And I,

106
03:00:18,0 --> 03:00:18,0
John,

107
03:00:18,0 --> 03:00:18,0
bear

108
03:00:18,0 --> 03:00:18,0
record, and lo,

109
03:00:18,0 --> 03:00:18,0
the

110
03:00:18,0 --> 03:00:18,0
heavens were

111
03:00:18,0 --> 03:00:18,0
opened,

112
03:00:18,0 --> 03:00:18,0
and the

113
03:00:18,0 --> 03:00:18,0
Holy Ghost

114
03:00:18,0 --> 03:00:18,0
descended

115
03:00:18,0 --> 03:00:18,0
upon him

116
03:00:18,0 --> 03:00:18,0
in the

117
03:00:18,0 --> 03:00:18,0
form of a

118
03:00:18,0 --> 03:00:18,0
dove, and

119
03:00:18,0 --> 03:00:18,0
sat upon

120
03:00:18,0 --> 03:00:18,0
him, and

121
03:00:18,0 --> 03:00:18,0
there

122
03:00:18,0 --> 03:00:18,0
came a

123
03:00:18,0 --> 03:00:18,0
voice out of

124
03:00:18,0 --> 03:00:18,0
heaven

125
03:00:18,0 --> 03:03:57,
saying: This is my beloved Son.

126
03:03:57,0 --> 03:03:57,0
16 And

127
03:03:57,0 --> 03:03:57,0
I, John,

128
03:03:57,0 --> 03:03:57,0
bear

129
03:03:57,0 --> 03:03:57,0
record that

130
03:03:57,0 --> 03:03:57,0
he

131
03:03:57,0 --> 03:03:57,0
received a

132
03:03:57,0 --> 03:03:57,0
fulness

133
03:03:57,0 --> 03:03:57,0
of the

134
03:03:57,0 --> 03:03:57,0
glory of

135
03:03:57,0 --> 03:18:59,
the Father;

136
03:18:59,0 --> 03:18:59,0
17 And

137
03:18:59,0 --> 03:18:59,0
he

138
03:18:59,0 --> 03:18:59,0
received

139
03:18:59,0 --> 03:18:59,0
all

140
03:18:59,0 --> 03:18:59,0
power, both

141
03:18:59,0 --> 03:18:59,0
in

142
03:18:59,0 --> 03:18:59,0
heaven and

143
03:18:59,0 --> 03:18:59,0
on

144
03:18:59,0 --> 03:18:59,0
earth, and

145
03:18:59,0 --> 03:18:59,0
the

146
03:18:59,0 --> 03:18:59,0
glory of

147
03:18:59,0 --> 03:18:59,0
the

148
03:18:59,0 --> 03:18:59,0
Father was

149
03:18:59,0 --> 03:18:59,0
with

150
03:18:59,0 --> 03:18:59,0
him, for

151
03:18:59,0 --> 03:29:02,
he dwelt in him.

152
03:29:02,0 --> 03:29:02,0
18 And

153
03:29:02,0 --> 03:29:02,0
it

154
03:29:02,0 --> 03:29:02,0
shall

155
03:29:02,0 --> 03:29:02,0
come to

156
03:29:02,0 --> 03:29:02,0
pass,

157
03:29:02,0 --> 03:29:02,0
that

158
03:29:02,0 --> 03:29:02,0
if you

159
03:29:02,0 --> 03:29:02,0
are

160
03:29:02,0 --> 03:29:02,0
faithful

161
03:29:02,0 --> 03:29:02,0
you

162
03:29:02,0 --> 03:29:02,0
shall

163
03:29:02,0 --> 03:29:02,0
receive

164
03:29:02,0 --> 03:29:02,0
the

03:29:02,0 --> 03:29:02,0
fulness

166
03:29:02,0 --> 03:29:02,0
of

167
03:29:02,0 --> 03:40:40,
the record of John.

168
03:40:40,0 --> 03:40:40,0
19 I

169
03:40:40,0 --> 03:40:40,0
give

170
