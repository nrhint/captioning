1
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:20,396
Section 93 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:20,396 --> 00:00:29,514
 the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, May 6, 1833. 
1–5,

3
00:00:29,514 --> 00:00:38,632
 All who are faithful will see the Lord; 
6–18,

4
00:00:38,632 --> 00:00:47,75
 John bore record that the Son of God went from grace

5
00:00:47,75 --> 00:00:56,868
 to grace until He received a fulness of the glory

6
00:00:56,868 --> 00:01:05,986
 of the Father; 
19–20, Faithful men, going from

7
00:01:05,986 --> 00:01:15,104
 grace to grace, will also receive of His fulness;

8
00:01:15,104 --> 00:01:24,222
21–22, Those who are begotten through Christ are

9
00:01:24,222 --> 00:01:33,34
 the Church of the Firstborn; 
23–28, Christ received

10
00:01:33,34 --> 00:01:42,458
 a fulness of all truth, and man by obedience may

11
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:51,576
 do likewise; 
29–32, Man was in the beginning with

12
00:01:51,576 --> 00:02:00,694
 God; 
33–35, The elements are eternal, and man

13
00:02:00,694 --> 00:02:09,812
 may receive a fulness of joy in the Resurrection;

14
00:02:09,812 --> 00:02:18,93
36–37, The glory of God is intelligence; 
38–40,

15
00:02:18,93 --> 00:02:28,048
 Children are innocent before God because of the

16
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:37,166
 redemption of Christ; 
41–53, The leading brethren are

17
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:46,284
 commanded to set their families in order.

18
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:52,533
1 Verily, thus saith the Lord: It shall come to

19
00:02:52,533 --> 00:02:58,933
 pass that every soul who forsaketh his sins and

20
00:02:58,933 --> 00:03:05,333
 cometh unto me, and calleth on my name, and obeyeth my

21
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:11,733
 voice, and keepeth my commandments, shall see my

22
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:18,133
 face and know that I am

23
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:24,098
2 And that I am the true light that lighteth every

24
00:03:24,098 --> 00:03:30,098
 man that cometh into the world

25
00:03:30,11 --> 00:03:35,61
3 And that I am in the Father, and the Father in

26
00:03:35,61 --> 00:03:41,11
 me, and the Father and I are one

27
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:47,788
4 The Father because he gave me of his fulness,

28
00:03:47,788 --> 00:03:54,455
 and the Son because I was in the world and made

29
00:03:54,455 --> 00:04:01,122
 flesh my tabernacle, and dwelt among the sons of men

30
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:06,908
5 I was in the world and received of my Father,

31
00:04:06,908 --> 00:04:12,408
 and the works of him were plainly manifest

32
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:17,019
6 And John saw and bore record of the fulness of

33
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:21,352
 my glory, and the fulness of John’s record is

34
00:04:21,352 --> 00:04:25,685
 hereafter to be revealed

35
00:04:25,715 --> 00:04:32,715
7 And he bore record, saying: I saw his glory,

36
00:04:32,715 --> 00:04:39,715
 that he was in the beginning, before the world was

37
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:46,729
8 Therefore, in the beginning the Word was, for he

38
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:53,729
 was the Word, even the messenger of salvation

39
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:58,993
9 The light and the Redeemer of the world; the

40
00:04:58,993 --> 00:05:04,493
 Spirit of truth, who came into the world, because the

41
00:05:04,493 --> 00:05:09,993
 world was made by him, and in him was the life of

42
00:05:09,993 --> 00:05:15,493
 men and the light of men

43
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:20,248
10 The worlds were made by him; men were made by

44
00:05:20,248 --> 00:05:25,248
 him; all things were made by him, and through him,

45
00:05:25,248 --> 00:05:30,248
 and of him

46
00:05:30,514 --> 00:05:35,514
11 And I, John, bear record that I beheld his

47
00:05:35,514 --> 00:05:40,514
 glory, as the glory of the Only Begotten of the

48
00:05:40,514 --> 00:05:45,514
 Father, full of grace and truth, even the Spirit of

49
00:05:45,514 --> 00:05:50,514
 truth, which came and dwelt in the flesh, and dwelt

50
00:05:50,514 --> 00:05:55,514
 among us

51
00:05:55,338 --> 00:06:02,338
12 And I, John, saw that he received not of the

52
00:06:02,338 --> 00:06:09,338
 fulness at the first, but received grace for grace

53
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:14,303
13 And he received not of the fulness at first,

54
00:06:14,303 --> 00:06:18,97
 but continued from grace to grace, until he received

55
00:06:18,97 --> 00:06:23,637
 a fulness

56
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:29,133
14 And thus he was called the Son of God, because

57
00:06:29,133 --> 00:06:34,633
 he received not of the fulness at the first

58
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:39,044
15 And I, John, bear record, and lo, the heavens

59
00:06:39,044 --> 00:06:43,444
 were opened, and the Holy Ghost descended upon him

60
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:47,844
 in the form of a dove, and sat upon him, and there

61
00:06:47,844 --> 00:06:52,244
 came a voice out of heaven saying: This is my

62
00:06:52,244 --> 00:06:56,644
 beloved Son

63
00:06:56,917 --> 00:07:00,917
16 And I, John, bear record that he received a

64
00:07:00,917 --> 00:07:04,917
 fulness of the glory of the Father

65
00:07:04,441 --> 00:07:09,774
17 And he received all power, both in heaven and

66
00:07:09,774 --> 00:07:15,107
 on earth, and the glory of the Father was with him,

67
00:07:15,107 --> 00:07:20,44
 for he dwelt in him

68
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:24,974
18 And it shall come to pass, that if you are

69
00:07:24,974 --> 00:07:28,974
 faithful you shall receive the fulness of the record

70
00:07:28,974 --> 00:07:32,974
 of John

71
00:07:32,736 --> 00:07:39,986
19 I give unto you these sayings that you may

72
00:07:39,986 --> 00:07:47,236
 understand and know how to worship, and know what you

73
00:07:47,236 --> 00:07:54,486
 worship, that you may come unto the Father in my

74
00:07:54,486 --> 00:08:01,736
 name, and in due time receive of his fulness

75
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:07,747
20 For if you keep my commandments you shall

76
00:08:07,747 --> 00:08:14,247
 receive of his fulness, and be glorified in me as I am

77
00:08:14,247 --> 00:08:20,747
 in the Father; therefore, I say unto you, you

78
00:08:20,747 --> 00:08:27,247
 shall receive grace for grace

79
00:08:27,24 --> 00:08:31,74
21 And now, verily I say unto you, I was in the

80
00:08:31,74 --> 00:08:36,24
 beginning with the Father, and am the Firstborn

81
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:41,216
22 And all those who are begotten through me are

82
00:08:41,216 --> 00:08:45,883
 partakers of the glory of the same, and are the

83
00:08:45,883 --> 00:08:50,55
 church of the Firstborn

84
00:08:50,83 --> 00:08:56,83
23 Ye were also in the beginning with the Father;

85
00:08:56,83 --> 00:09:02,83
 that which is Spirit, even the Spirit of truth

86
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:07,108
24 And truth is knowledge of things as they are,

87
00:09:07,108 --> 00:09:12,108
 and as they were, and as they are to come

88
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:16,086
25 And whatsoever is more or less than this is the

89
00:09:16,086 --> 00:09:19,753
 spirit of that wicked one who was a liar from the

90
00:09:19,753 --> 00:09:23,42
 beginning

91
00:09:23,246 --> 00:09:28,246
26 The Spirit of truth is of God. I am the Spirit

92
00:09:28,246 --> 00:09:33,246
 of truth, and John bore record of me, saying: He

93
00:09:33,246 --> 00:09:38,246
 received a fulness of truth, yea, even of all

94
00:09:38,246 --> 00:09:43,246
 truth

95
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:47,233
27 And no man receiveth a fulness unless he

96
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:51,233
 keepeth his commandments

97
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:56,891
28 He that keepeth his commandments receiveth

98
00:09:56,891 --> 00:10:02,558
 truth and light, until he is glorified in truth and

99
00:10:02,558 --> 00:10:08,225
 knoweth all things

100
00:10:08,258 --> 00:10:14,258
29 Man was also in the beginning with God.

101
00:10:14,258 --> 00:10:20,258
 Intelligence, or the light of truth, was not created or

102
00:10:20,258 --> 00:10:26,258
 made, neither indeed can be

103
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:31,259
30 All truth is independent in that sphere in

104
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:36,259
 which God has placed it, to act for itself, as all

105
00:10:36,259 --> 00:10:41,259
 intelligence also; otherwise there is no existence

106
00:10:41,758 --> 00:10:47,258
31 Behold, here is the agency of man, and here is

107
00:10:47,258 --> 00:10:52,758
 the condemnation of man; because that which was

108
00:10:52,758 --> 00:10:58,258
 from the beginning is plainly manifest unto them,

109
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:03,758
 and they receive not the light

110
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:07,746
32 And every man whose spirit receiveth not the

111
00:11:07,746 --> 00:11:11,746
 light is under condemnation

112
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:18,921
33 For man is spirit. The elements are eternal,

113
00:11:18,921 --> 00:11:26,588
 and spirit and element, inseparably connected,

114
00:11:26,588 --> 00:11:34,255
 receive a fulness of joy

115
00:11:34,744 --> 00:11:38,244
34 And when separated, man cannot receive a

116
00:11:38,244 --> 00:11:41,744
 fulness of joy

117
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:48,784
35 The elements are the tabernacle of God; yea,

118
00:11:48,784 --> 00:11:56,534
 man is the tabernacle of God, even temples; and

119
00:11:56,534 --> 00:12:04,284
 whatsoever temple is defiled, God shall destroy that

120
00:12:04,284 --> 00:12:12,034
 temple

121
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:18,499
36 The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other

122
00:12:18,499 --> 00:12:23,999
 words, light and truth

123
00:12:23,293 --> 00:12:28,293
37 Light and truth forsake that evil one

124
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:34,331
38 Every spirit of man was innocent in the

125
00:12:34,331 --> 00:12:40,081
 beginning; and God having redeemed man from the fall, men

126
00:12:40,081 --> 00:12:45,831
 became again, in their infant state, innocent

127
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:51,581
 before God

128
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:56,071
39 And that wicked one cometh and taketh away

129
00:12:56,071 --> 00:13:00,571
 light and truth, through disobedience, from the

130
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:05,071
 children of men, and because of the tradition of their

131
00:13:05,071 --> 00:13:09,571
 fathers

132
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:14,356
40 But I have commanded you to bring up your

133
00:13:14,356 --> 00:13:18,856
 children in light and truth

134
00:13:18,648 --> 00:13:21,315
41 But verily I say unto you, my servant

135
00:13:21,315 --> 00:13:23,982
 Frederick G. Williams, you have continued under this

136
00:13:23,982 --> 00:13:26,649
 condemnation

137
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:31,423
42 You have not taught your children light and

138
00:13:31,423 --> 00:13:36,173
 truth, according to the commandments; and that wicked

139
00:13:36,173 --> 00:13:40,923
 one hath power, as yet, over you, and this is the

140
00:13:40,923 --> 00:13:45,673
 cause of your affliction

141
00:13:45,441 --> 00:13:49,441
43 And now a commandment I give unto you—if you

142
00:13:49,441 --> 00:13:53,441
 will be delivered you shall set in order your own

143
00:13:53,441 --> 00:13:57,441
 house, for there are many things that are not right

144
00:13:57,441 --> 00:14:01,441
 in your house

145
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:07,008
44 Verily, I say unto my servant Sidney Rigdon,

146
00:14:07,008 --> 00:14:12,258
 that in some things he hath not kept the

147
00:14:12,258 --> 00:14:17,508
 commandments concerning his children; therefore, first set in

148
00:14:17,508 --> 00:14:22,758
 order thy house

149
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:27,012
45 Verily, I say unto my servant Joseph Smith,

150
00:14:27,012 --> 00:14:31,262
 Jun., or in other words, I will call you friends, for

151
00:14:31,262 --> 00:14:35,512
 you are my friends, and ye shall have an

152
00:14:35,512 --> 00:14:39,762
 inheritance with me

153
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:44,779
46 I called you servants for the world’s sake, and

154
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:49,779
 ye are their servants for my sake

155
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:52,989
47 And now, verily I say unto Joseph Smith,

156
00:14:52,989 --> 00:14:56,656
 Jun.—You have not kept the commandments, and must needs

157
00:14:56,656 --> 00:15:00,323
 stand rebuked before the Lord

158
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:06,0
48 Your family must needs repent and forsake some

159
00:15:06,0 --> 00:15:13,667
 things, and give more earnest heed unto your

160
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:20,334
 sayings, or be removed out of their place

161
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:28,669
49 What I say unto one I say unto all; pray always

162
00:15:28,669 --> 00:15:37,002
 lest that wicked one have power in you, and

163
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:45,335
 remove you out of your place

164
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:51,544
50 My servant Newel K. Whitney also, a bishop of

165
00:15:51,544 --> 00:15:57,744
 my church, hath need to be chastened, and set in

166
00:15:57,744 --> 00:16:03,944
 order his family, and see that they are more

167
00:16:03,944 --> 00:16:10,144
 diligent and concerned at home, and pray always, or they

168
00:16:10,144 --> 00:16:16,344
 shall be removed out of their place

169
00:16:16,325 --> 00:16:21,158
51 Now, I say unto you, my friends, let my servant

170
00:16:21,158 --> 00:16:25,991
 Sidney Rigdon go on his journey, and make haste,

171
00:16:25,991 --> 00:16:30,824
 and also proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord,

172
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:35,657
 and the gospel of salvation, as I shall give him

173
00:16:35,657 --> 00:16:40,49
 utterance; and by your prayer of faith with one

174
00:16:40,49 --> 00:16:45,323
 consent I will uphold him
