30, 1831. 
1–2, The keys of the kingdom of God are

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
committed to man on earth, and the gospel cause

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
will triumph; 
3–6, The millennial kingdom of

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:48:58,
heaven will come and join the kingdom of God on earth. 

7
00:48:58,0 --> 00:48:58,0
1 Hearken, and lo, a voice as of one sent

8
00:48:58,0 --> 00:48:58,0
down from on high, who is mighty and powerful,

9
00:48:58,0 --> 00:48:58,0
whose going forth is unto the ends of the

10
00:48:58,0 --> 00:48:58,0
earth, yea, whose voice is unto men—Prepare

11
00:48:58,0 --> 00:48:36,
ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.

12
00:48:36,0 --> 00:48:36,0
2 The keys of the kingdom of God are

13
00:48:36,0 --> 00:48:36,0
committed unto man on the earth, and from

14
00:48:36,0 --> 00:48:36,0
thence shall the gospel roll forth unto the

15
00:48:36,0 --> 00:48:36,0
ends of the earth, as the stone which is cut

16
00:48:36,0 --> 00:48:36,0
out of the mountain without hands shall

17
00:48:36,0 --> 00:44:16,
roll forth, until it has filled the whole earth.

18
00:44:16,0 --> 00:44:16,0
3 Yea, a voice crying—Prepare ye the

19
00:44:16,0 --> 00:44:16,0
way of the Lord, prepare ye the supper of

20
00:44:16,0 --> 00:49:21,
the Lamb, make ready for the Bridegroom.

21
00:49:21,0 --> 00:49:21,0
4 Pray unto the Lord, call upon

22
00:49:21,0 --> 00:49:21,0
his holy name, make known his

23
00:49:21,0 --> 01:16:19,
wonderful works among the people.

24
01:16:19,0 --> 01:16:19,0
5 Call upon the Lord, that his

25
01:16:19,0 --> 01:16:19,0
kingdom may go forth upon the

26
01:16:19,0 --> 01:16:19,0
earth, that the inhabitants

27
01:16:19,0 --> 01:16:19,0
thereof may receive it, and be

28
01:16:19,0 --> 01:16:19,0
prepared for the days to come,

29
01:16:19,0 --> 01:16:19,0
in the which the Son of Man

30
01:16:19,0 --> 01:16:19,0
shall come down in heaven,

31
01:16:19,0 --> 01:16:19,0
clothed in the brightness of his

32
01:16:19,0 --> 01:16:19,0
glory, to meet the kingdom of

33
01:16:19,0 --> 01:43:55,
God which is set up on the earth.

34
01:43:55,0 --> 01:43:55,0
6 Wherefore, may the

35
01:43:55,0 --> 01:43:55,0
kingdom of God go forth, that the

36
01:43:55,0 --> 01:43:55,0
kingdom of heaven may

37
01:43:55,0 --> 01:43:55,0
come, that thou, O God, mayest

38
01:43:55,0 --> 01:43:55,0
be glorified in heaven so

39
01:43:55,0 --> 01:43:55,0
on earth, that thine enemies

40
01:43:55,0 --> 01:43:55,0
may be subdued; for thine

41
01:43:55,0 --> 01:43:55,0
is the honor, power and

42
01:43:55,0 --> 02:08:56,
glory, forever and ever. Amen.
