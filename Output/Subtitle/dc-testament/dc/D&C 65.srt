1 Hearken, and lo, a voice as of one sent down

8
00:00:55,667 --> 00:01:01,067
 from on high, who is mighty and powerful, whose going

9
00:01:01,067 --> 00:01:06,467
 forth is unto the ends of the earth, yea, whose

10
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:11,867
 voice is unto men—Prepare ye the way of the Lord,

11
00:01:11,867 --> 00:01:17,267
 make his paths straight

12
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:22,261
2 The keys of the kingdom of God are committed

13
00:01:22,261 --> 00:01:26,761
 unto man on the earth, and from thence shall the

14
00:01:26,761 --> 00:01:31,261
 gospel roll forth unto the ends of the earth, as the

15
00:01:31,261 --> 00:01:35,761
 stone which is cut out of the mountain without

16
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:40,261
 hands shall roll forth, until it has filled the whole

17
00:01:40,261 --> 00:01:44,761
 earth

18
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:52,854
3 Yea, a voice crying—Prepare ye the way of the

19
00:01:52,854 --> 00:02:01,187
 Lord, prepare ye the supper of the Lamb, make ready

20
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:09,52
 for the Bridegroom

21
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:18,796

22
00:02:18,796 --> 00:02:27,796
 make known his wonderful works among the people

23
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:33,419
5 Call upon the Lord, that his kingdom may go

24
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:38,99
 forth upon the earth, that the inhabitants thereof may

25
00:02:38,99 --> 00:02:44,561
 receive it, and be prepared for the days to come,

26
00:02:44,561 --> 00:02:50,132
 in the which the Son of Man shall come down in

27
00:02:50,132 --> 00:02:55,703
 heaven, clothed in the brightness of his glory, to

28
00:02:55,703 --> 00:03:01,274
 meet the kingdom of God which is set up on the

29
00:03:01,274 --> 00:03:06,845
 earth

30
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:08,986
6 Wherefore, may the kingdom of God go forth, that

31
00:03:08,986 --> 00:03:11,386
 the kingdom of heaven may come, that thou, O God,

32
00:03:11,386 --> 00:03:13,786
 mayest be glorified in heaven so on earth, that

33
00:03:13,786 --> 00:03:16,186
 thine enemies may be subdued; for thine is the

34
00:03:16,186 --> 00:03:18,586
 honor, power and glory, forever and ever. Amen.
