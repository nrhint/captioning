1
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:19,191
Section 84 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:19,191 --> 00:00:26,87
 the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, September 22 and

3
00:00:26,87 --> 00:00:34,548
 23, 1832. During the month of September, elders had

4
00:00:34,548 --> 00:00:42,227
 begun to return from their missions in the eastern

5
00:00:42,227 --> 00:00:49,907
 states and to make reports of their labors. It

6
00:00:49,907 --> 00:00:57,585
 was while they were together in this season of joy

7
00:00:57,585 --> 00:01:05,264
 that the following communication was received. The

8
00:01:05,264 --> 00:01:12,944
 Prophet designated it a revelation on priesthood.

9
00:01:12,944 --> 00:01:20,623
1–5, The New Jerusalem and the temple will be

10
00:01:20,623 --> 00:01:28,302
 built in Missouri; 
6–17, The line of priesthood from

11
00:01:28,302 --> 00:01:35,981
 Moses to Adam is given; 
18–25, The greater

12
00:01:35,981 --> 00:01:43,659
 priesthood holds the key of the knowledge of God;

13
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:51,338
26–32, The lesser priesthood holds the key of the

14
00:01:51,338 --> 00:01:59,017
 ministering of angels and of the preparatory gospel;

15
00:01:59,017 --> 00:02:06,697
33–44, Men gain eternal life through the oath and

16
00:02:06,697 --> 00:02:14,376
 covenant of the priesthood; 
45–53, The Spirit of

17
00:02:14,376 --> 00:02:22,055
 Christ enlightens men, and the world lies in sin;

18
00:02:22,055 --> 00:02:29,734
54–61, The Saints must testify of those things

19
00:02:29,734 --> 00:02:37,413
 they have received; 
62–76, They are to preach the

20
00:02:37,413 --> 00:02:45,092
 gospel, and signs will follow; 
77–91, Elders are

21
00:02:45,092 --> 00:02:52,771
 to go forth without purse or scrip, and the Lord

22
00:02:52,771 --> 00:03:00,45
 will care for their needs; 
92–97, Plagues and

23
00:03:00,45 --> 00:03:08,129
 cursings await those who reject the gospel; 
98–102,

24
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:15,808
 The new song of the redemption of Zion is given;

25
00:03:15,808 --> 00:03:23,487
103–10, Let every man stand in his own office and

26
00:03:23,487 --> 00:03:31,166
 labor in his own calling; 
111–20, The Lord’s

27
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:38,845
 servants are to proclaim the abomination of desolation

28
00:03:38,845 --> 00:03:46,524
 of the last days.

29
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:51,392
1 A revelation of Jesus Christ unto his servant

30
00:03:51,392 --> 00:03:56,725
 Joseph Smith, Jun., and six elders, as they united

31
00:03:56,725 --> 00:04:02,058
 their hearts and lifted their voices on high

32
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:06,776
2 Yea, the word of the Lord concerning his church,

33
00:04:06,776 --> 00:04:11,443
 established in the last days for the restoration

34
00:04:11,443 --> 00:04:16,11
 of his people, as he has spoken by the mouth of

35
00:04:16,11 --> 00:04:20,777
 his prophets, and for the gathering of his saints to

36
00:04:20,777 --> 00:04:25,444
 stand upon Mount Zion, which shall be the city of

37
00:04:25,444 --> 00:04:30,111
 New Jerusalem

38
00:04:30,387 --> 00:04:35,22
3 Which city shall be built, beginning at the

39
00:04:35,22 --> 00:04:40,053
 temple lot, which is appointed by the finger of the

40
00:04:40,053 --> 00:04:44,886
 Lord, in the western boundaries of the State of

41
00:04:44,886 --> 00:04:49,719
 Missouri, and dedicated by the hand of Joseph Smith,

42
00:04:49,719 --> 00:04:54,552
 Jun., and others with whom the Lord was well

43
00:04:54,552 --> 00:04:59,385
 pleased

44
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:04,283
4 Verily this is the word of the Lord, that the

45
00:05:04,283 --> 00:05:08,683
 city New Jerusalem shall be built by the gathering

46
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:13,083
 of the saints, beginning at this place, even the

47
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:17,483
 place of the temple, which temple shall be reared in

48
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:21,883
 this generation

49
00:05:21,638 --> 00:05:26,838
5 For verily this generation shall not all pass

50
00:05:26,838 --> 00:05:32,038
 away until an house shall be built unto the Lord,

51
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:37,238
 and a cloud shall rest upon it, which cloud shall be

52
00:05:37,238 --> 00:05:42,438
 even the glory of the Lord, which shall fill the

53
00:05:42,438 --> 00:05:47,638
 house

54
00:05:47,631 --> 00:05:51,964
6 And the sons of Moses, according to the Holy

55
00:05:51,964 --> 00:05:56,297
 Priesthood which he received under the hand of his

56
00:05:56,297 --> 00:06:00,63
 father-in-law, Jethro

57
00:06:00,41 --> 00:06:06,41
7 And Jethro received it under the hand of Caleb

58
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:13,933
8 And Caleb received it under the hand of Elihu

59
00:06:13,223 --> 00:06:18,223
9 And Elihu under the hand of Jeremy

60
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:23,745
10 And Jeremy under the hand of Gad

61
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:28,283
11 And Gad under the hand of Esaias

62
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:35,805
12 And Esaias received it under the hand of God

63
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:39,595
13 Esaias also lived in the days of Abraham, and

64
00:06:39,595 --> 00:06:44,095
 was blessed of him

65
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:48,487
14 Which Abraham received the priesthood from

66
00:06:48,487 --> 00:06:52,82
 Melchizedek, who received it through the lineage of

67
00:06:52,82 --> 00:06:57,153
 his fathers, even till Noah

68
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:02,418
15 And from Noah till Enoch, through the lineage

69
00:07:02,418 --> 00:07:06,918
 of their fathers

70
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:11,226
16 And from Enoch to Abel, who was slain by the

71
00:07:11,226 --> 00:07:16,226
 conspiracy of his brother, who received the

72
00:07:16,226 --> 00:07:21,226
 priesthood by the commandments of God, by the hand of his

73
00:07:21,226 --> 00:07:26,226
 father Adam, who was the first man

74
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:32,18
17 Which priesthood continueth in the church of

75
00:07:32,18 --> 00:07:37,847
 God in all generations, and is without beginning of

76
00:07:37,847 --> 00:07:43,514
 days or end of years

77
00:07:43,53 --> 00:07:47,33
18 And the Lord confirmed a priesthood also upon

78
00:07:47,33 --> 00:07:51,13
 Aaron and his seed, throughout all their

79
00:07:51,13 --> 00:07:54,93
 generations, which priesthood also continueth and abideth

80
00:07:54,93 --> 00:07:58,73
 forever with the priesthood which is after the

81
00:07:58,73 --> 00:08:02,53
 holiest order of God

82
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:06,381
19 And this greater priesthood administereth the

83
00:08:06,381 --> 00:08:10,714
 gospel and holdeth the key of the mysteries of the

84
00:08:10,714 --> 00:08:15,047
 kingdom, even the key of the knowledge of God

85
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:18,078
20 Therefore, in the ordinances thereof, the power

86
00:08:18,078 --> 00:08:21,078
 of godliness is manifest

87
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:25,934
21 And without the ordinances thereof, and the

88
00:08:25,934 --> 00:08:30,267
 authority of the priesthood, the power of godliness

89
00:08:30,267 --> 00:08:34,6
 is not manifest unto men in the flesh

90
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:40,881
22 For without this no man can see the face of

91
00:08:40,881 --> 00:08:47,381
 God, even the Father, and live

92
00:08:47,66 --> 00:08:53,16
23 Now this Moses plainly taught to the children

93
00:08:53,16 --> 00:08:58,66
 of Israel in the wilderness, and sought diligently

94
00:08:58,66 --> 00:09:04,16
 to sanctify his people that they might behold the

95
00:09:04,16 --> 00:09:09,66
 face of God

96
00:09:09,165 --> 00:09:13,665
24 But they hardened their hearts and could not

97
00:09:13,665 --> 00:09:18,165
 endure his presence; therefore, the Lord in his

98
00:09:18,165 --> 00:09:22,665
 wrath, for his anger was kindled against them, swore

99
00:09:22,665 --> 00:09:27,165
 that they should not enter into his rest while in

100
00:09:27,165 --> 00:09:31,665
 the wilderness, which rest is the fulness of his

101
00:09:31,665 --> 00:09:36,165
 glory

102
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:41,659
25 Therefore, he took Moses out of their midst,

103
00:09:41,659 --> 00:09:47,159
 and the Holy Priesthood also

104
00:09:47,67 --> 00:09:51,67
26 And the lesser priesthood continued, which

105
00:09:51,67 --> 00:09:55,67
 priesthood holdeth the key of the ministering of

106
00:09:55,67 --> 00:09:59,67
 angels and the preparatory gospel

107
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:04,289
27 Which gospel is the gospel of repentance and of

108
00:10:04,289 --> 00:10:09,146
 baptism, and the remission of sins, and the law

109
00:10:09,146 --> 00:10:14,003
 of carnal commandments, which the Lord in his wrath

110
00:10:14,003 --> 00:10:18,86
 caused to continue with the house of Aaron among

111
00:10:18,86 --> 00:10:23,717
 the children of Israel until John, whom God raised

112
00:10:23,717 --> 00:10:28,574
 up, being filled with the Holy Ghost from his

113
00:10:28,574 --> 00:10:33,431
 mother’s womb

114
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:38,79
28 For he was baptized while he was yet in his

115
00:10:38,79 --> 00:10:43,647
 childhood, and was ordained by the angel of God at

116
00:10:43,647 --> 00:10:48,504
 the time he was eight days old unto this power, to

117
00:10:48,504 --> 00:10:53,361
 overthrow the kingdom of the Jews, and to make

118
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:58,218
 straight the way of the Lord before the face of his

119
00:10:58,218 --> 00:11:03,075
 people, to prepare them for the coming of the Lord,

120
00:11:03,075 --> 00:11:07,932
 in whose hand is given all power

121
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:11,934
29 And again, the offices of elder and bishop are

122
00:11:11,934 --> 00:11:15,934
 necessary appendages belonging unto the high

123
00:11:15,934 --> 00:11:19,934
 priesthood

124
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:24,679
30 And again, the offices of teacher and deacon

125
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:29,429
 are necessary appendages belonging to the lesser

126
00:11:29,429 --> 00:11:34,179
 priesthood, which priesthood was confirmed upon Aaron

127
00:11:34,179 --> 00:11:38,929
 and his sons

128
00:11:38,214 --> 00:11:43,214
31 Therefore, as I said concerning the sons of

129
00:11:43,214 --> 00:11:48,214
 Moses—for the sons of Moses and also the sons of

130
00:11:48,214 --> 00:11:53,214
 Aaron shall offer an acceptable offering and sacrifice

131
00:11:53,214 --> 00:11:58,214
 in the house of the Lord, which house shall be

132
00:11:58,214 --> 00:12:03,214
 built unto the Lord in this generation, upon the

133
00:12:03,214 --> 00:12:08,214
 consecrated spot as I have appointed

134
00:12:08,711 --> 00:12:13,711
32 And the sons of Moses and of Aaron shall be

135
00:12:13,711 --> 00:12:18,711
 filled with the glory of the Lord, upon Mount Zion in

136
00:12:18,711 --> 00:12:23,711
 the Lord’s house, whose sons are ye; and also

137
00:12:23,711 --> 00:12:28,711
 many whom I have called and sent forth to build up my

138
00:12:28,711 --> 00:12:33,711
 church

139
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:38,002
33 For whoso is faithful unto the obtaining these

140
00:12:38,002 --> 00:12:43,002
 two priesthoods of which I have spoken, and the

141
00:12:43,002 --> 00:12:48,002
 magnifying their calling, are sanctified by the

142
00:12:48,002 --> 00:12:53,002
 Spirit unto the renewing of their bodies

143
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:58,44
34 They become the sons of Moses and of Aaron and

144
00:12:58,44 --> 00:13:03,107
 the seed of Abraham, and the church and kingdom,

145
00:13:03,107 --> 00:13:07,774
 and the elect of God

146
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:12,037
35 And also all they who receive this priesthood

147
00:13:12,037 --> 00:13:16,537
 receive me, saith the Lord

148
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:19,562
36 For he that receiveth my servants receiveth me

149
00:13:19,562 --> 00:13:22,562


150
00:13:22,852 --> 00:13:28,852
37 And he that receiveth me receiveth my Father

151
00:13:28,858 --> 00:13:32,858
38 And he that receiveth my Father receiveth my

152
00:13:32,858 --> 00:13:36,858
 Father’s kingdom; therefore all that my Father hath

153
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:40,858
 shall be given unto him

154
00:13:40,37 --> 00:13:44,37
39 And this is according to the oath and covenant

155
00:13:44,37 --> 00:13:48,37
 which belongeth to the priesthood

156
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:55,244
40 Therefore, all those who receive the

157
00:13:55,244 --> 00:14:01,577
 priesthood, receive this oath and covenant of my Father,

158
00:14:01,577 --> 00:14:07,91
 which he cannot break, neither can it be moved

159
00:14:07,196 --> 00:14:11,196
41 But whoso breaketh this covenant after he hath

160
00:14:11,196 --> 00:14:15,196
 received it, and altogether turneth therefrom,

161
00:14:15,196 --> 00:14:19,196
 shall not have forgiveness of sins in this world nor

162
00:14:19,196 --> 00:14:23,196
 in the world to come

163
00:14:23,179 --> 00:14:28,012
42 And wo unto all those who come not unto this

164
00:14:28,012 --> 00:14:32,845
 priesthood which ye have received, which I now

165
00:14:32,845 --> 00:14:37,678
 confirm upon you who are present this day, by mine own

166
00:14:37,678 --> 00:14:42,511
 voice out of the heavens; and even I have given

167
00:14:42,511 --> 00:14:47,344
 the heavenly hosts and mine angels charge concerning

168
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:52,177
 you

169
00:14:52,175 --> 00:14:56,508
43 And I now give unto you a commandment to beware

170
00:14:56,508 --> 00:15:00,841
 concerning yourselves, to give diligent heed to

171
00:15:00,841 --> 00:15:05,174
 the words of eternal life

172
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:10,971
44 For you shall live by every word that

173
00:15:10,971 --> 00:15:16,471
 proceedeth forth from the mouth of God

174
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:21,482
45 For the word of the Lord is truth, and

175
00:15:21,482 --> 00:15:26,482
 whatsoever is truth is light, and whatsoever is light is

176
00:15:26,482 --> 00:15:31,482
 Spirit, even the Spirit of Jesus Christ

177
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:35,747
46 And the Spirit giveth light to every man that

178
00:15:35,747 --> 00:15:39,997
 cometh into the world; and the Spirit enlighteneth

179
00:15:39,997 --> 00:15:44,247
 every man through the world, that hearkeneth to

180
00:15:44,247 --> 00:15:48,497
 the voice of the Spirit

181
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:52,281
47 And every one that hearkeneth to the voice of

182
00:15:52,281 --> 00:15:56,281
 the Spirit cometh unto God, even the Father

183
00:15:56,272 --> 00:16:00,272
48 And the Father teacheth him of the covenant

184
00:16:00,272 --> 00:16:04,272
 which he has renewed and confirmed upon you, which is

185
00:16:04,272 --> 00:16:08,272
 confirmed upon you for your sakes, and not for

186
00:16:08,272 --> 00:16:12,272
 your sakes only, but for the sake of the whole

187
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:16,272
 world

188
00:16:16,025 --> 00:16:22,525
49 And the whole world lieth in sin, and groaneth

189
00:16:22,525 --> 00:16:29,025
 under darkness and under the bondage of sin

190
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:34,789
50 And by this you may know they are under the

191
00:16:34,789 --> 00:16:39,789
 bondage of sin, because they come not unto me

192
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:43,832
51 For whoso cometh not unto me is under the

193
00:16:43,832 --> 00:16:47,832
 bondage of sin

194
00:16:47,59 --> 00:16:51,59
52 And whoso receiveth not my voice is not

195
00:16:51,59 --> 00:16:55,59
 acquainted with my voice, and is not of me

196
00:16:55,898 --> 00:17:02,898
53 And by this you may know the righteous from the

197
00:17:02,898 --> 00:17:09,898
 wicked, and that the whole world groaneth under

198
00:17:09,898 --> 00:17:16,898
 sin and darkness even now

199
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:21,236
54 And your minds in times past have been darkened

200
00:17:21,236 --> 00:17:25,569
 because of unbelief, and because you have treated

201
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:29,902
 lightly the things you have received

202
00:17:29,198 --> 00:17:33,198
55 Which vanity and unbelief have brought the

203
00:17:33,198 --> 00:17:37,198
 whole church under condemnation

204
00:17:37,506 --> 00:17:41,506
56 And this condemnation resteth upon the children

205
00:17:41,506 --> 00:17:45,506
 of Zion, even all

206
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:50,898
57 And they shall remain under this condemnation

207
00:17:50,898 --> 00:17:56,298
 until they repent and remember the new covenant,

208
00:17:56,298 --> 00:18:01,698
 even the Book of Mormon and the former commandments

209
00:18:01,698 --> 00:18:07,098
 which I have given them, not only to say, but to

210
00:18:07,098 --> 00:18:12,498
 do according to that which I have written

211
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:16,774
58 That they may bring forth fruit meet for their

212
00:18:16,774 --> 00:18:21,524
 Father’s kingdom; otherwise there remaineth a

213
00:18:21,524 --> 00:18:26,274
 scourge and judgment to be poured out upon the

214
00:18:26,274 --> 00:18:31,024
 children of Zion

215
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:35,527
59 For shall the children of the kingdom pollute

216
00:18:35,527 --> 00:18:40,027
 my holy land? Verily, I say unto you, Nay

217
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:44,22
60 Verily, verily, I say unto you who now hear my

218
00:18:44,22 --> 00:18:47,887
 words, which are my voice, blessed are ye inasmuch

219
00:18:47,887 --> 00:18:51,554
 as you receive these things

220
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:57,631
61 For I will forgive you of your sins with this

221
00:18:57,631 --> 00:19:03,431
 commandment—that you remain steadfast in your minds

222
00:19:03,431 --> 00:19:09,231
 in solemnity and the spirit of prayer, in bearing

223
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:15,031
 testimony to all the world of those things which

224
00:19:15,031 --> 00:19:20,831
 are communicated unto you

225
00:19:20,109 --> 00:19:25,609
62 Therefore, go ye into all the world; and unto

226
00:19:25,609 --> 00:19:31,109
 whatsoever place ye cannot go ye shall send, that

227
00:19:31,109 --> 00:19:36,609
 the testimony may go from you into all the world

228
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:42,109
 unto every creature

229
00:19:42,131 --> 00:19:46,631
63 And as I said unto mine apostles, even so I say

230
00:19:46,631 --> 00:19:51,131
 unto you, for you are mine apostles, even God’s

231
00:19:51,131 --> 00:19:55,631
 high priests; ye are they whom my Father hath given

232
00:19:55,631 --> 00:20:00,131
 me; ye are my friends

233
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:06,416
64 Therefore, as I said unto mine apostles I say

234
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:12,166
 unto you again, that every soul who believeth on

235
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:17,916
 your words, and is baptized by water for the

236
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:23,666
 remission of sins, shall receive the Holy Ghost

237
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:28,423
65 And these signs shall follow them that believe

238
00:20:28,423 --> 00:20:32,923


239
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:38,465
66 In my name they shall do many wonderful works

240
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:44,471
67 In my name they shall cast out devils

241
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:49,243
68 In my name they shall heal the sick

242
00:20:49,532 --> 00:20:53,532
69 In my name they shall open the eyes of the

243
00:20:53,532 --> 00:20:57,532
 blind, and unstop the ears of the deaf

244
00:20:57,84 --> 00:21:02,84
70 And the tongue of the dumb shall speak

245
00:21:02,378 --> 00:21:05,378
71 And if any man shall administer poison unto

246
00:21:05,378 --> 00:21:08,378
 them it shall not hurt them

247
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:11,167
72 And the poison of a serpent shall not have

248
00:21:11,167 --> 00:21:13,667
 power to harm them

249
00:21:13,489 --> 00:21:17,289
73 But a commandment I give unto them, that they

250
00:21:17,289 --> 00:21:21,089
 shall not boast themselves of these things, neither

251
00:21:21,089 --> 00:21:24,889
 speak them before the world; for these things are

252
00:21:24,889 --> 00:21:28,689
 given unto you for your profit and for salvation

253
00:21:28,689 --> 00:21:32,489


254
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:37,659
74 Verily, verily, I say unto you, they who

255
00:21:37,659 --> 00:21:42,326
 believe not on your words, and are not baptized in water

256
00:21:42,326 --> 00:21:46,993
 in my name, for the remission of their sins, that

257
00:21:46,993 --> 00:21:51,66
 they may receive the Holy Ghost, shall be damned,

258
00:21:51,66 --> 00:21:56,327
 and shall not come into my Father’s kingdom where

259
00:21:56,327 --> 00:22:00,994
 my Father and I am

260
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:04,986
75 And this revelation unto you, and commandment,

261
00:22:04,986 --> 00:22:09,236
 is in force from this very hour upon all the

262
00:22:09,236 --> 00:22:13,486
 world, and the gospel is unto all who have not received

263
00:22:13,486 --> 00:22:17,736
 it

264
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:23,039
76 But, verily I say unto all those to whom the

265
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:28,325
 kingdom has been given—from you it must be preached

266
00:22:28,325 --> 00:22:33,611
 unto them, that they shall repent of their former

267
00:22:33,611 --> 00:22:38,897
 evil works; for they are to be upbraided for their

268
00:22:38,897 --> 00:22:44,183
 evil hearts of unbelief, and your brethren in

269
00:22:44,183 --> 00:22:49,469
 Zion for their rebellion against you at the time I

270
00:22:49,469 --> 00:22:54,755
 sent you

271
00:22:54,023 --> 00:22:59,223
77 And again I say unto you, my friends, for from

272
00:22:59,223 --> 00:23:04,423
 henceforth I shall call you friends, it is

273
00:23:04,423 --> 00:23:09,623
 expedient that I give unto you this commandment, that ye

274
00:23:09,623 --> 00:23:14,823
 become even as my friends in days when I was with

275
00:23:14,823 --> 00:23:20,023
 them, traveling to preach the gospel in my power

276
00:23:20,015 --> 00:23:26,015
78 For I suffered them not to have purse or scrip,

277
00:23:26,015 --> 00:23:32,015
 neither two coats

278
00:23:32,027 --> 00:23:37,027
79 Behold, I send you out to prove the world, and

279
00:23:37,027 --> 00:23:42,027
 the laborer is worthy of his hire

280
00:23:42,805 --> 00:23:48,091
80 And any man that shall go and preach this

281
00:23:48,091 --> 00:23:53,377
 gospel of the kingdom, and fail not to continue

282
00:23:53,377 --> 00:23:58,663
 faithful in all things, shall not be weary in mind,

283
00:23:58,663 --> 00:24:03,949
 neither darkened, neither in body, limb, nor joint; and

284
00:24:03,949 --> 00:24:09,235
 a hair of his head shall not fall to the ground

285
00:24:09,235 --> 00:24:14,521
 unnoticed. And they shall not go hungry, neither

286
00:24:14,521 --> 00:24:19,807
 athirst

287
00:24:19,308 --> 00:24:24,641
81 Therefore, take ye no thought for the morrow,

288
00:24:24,641 --> 00:24:29,974
 for what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, or

289
00:24:29,974 --> 00:24:35,307
 wherewithal ye shall be clothed

290
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:44,841
82 For, consider the lilies of the field, how they

291
00:24:44,841 --> 00:24:53,841
 grow, they toil not, neither do they spin; and

292
00:24:53,841 --> 00:25:02,841
 the kingdoms of the world, in all their glory, are

293
00:25:02,841 --> 00:25:11,841
 not arrayed like one of these

294
00:25:11,577 --> 00:25:15,577
83 For your Father, who is in heaven, knoweth that

295
00:25:15,577 --> 00:25:19,577
 you have need of all these things

296
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:23,084
84 Therefore, let the morrow take thought for the

297
00:25:23,084 --> 00:25:27,084
 things of itself

298
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:32,726
85 Neither take ye thought beforehand what ye

299
00:25:32,726 --> 00:25:38,326
 shall say; but treasure up in your minds continually

300
00:25:38,326 --> 00:25:43,926
 the words of life, and it shall be given you in the

301
00:25:43,926 --> 00:25:49,526
 very hour that portion that shall be meted unto

302
00:25:49,526 --> 00:25:55,126
 every man

303
00:25:55,888 --> 00:26:00,888
86 Therefore, let no man among you, for this

304
00:26:00,888 --> 00:26:05,888
 commandment is unto all the faithful who are called of

305
00:26:05,888 --> 00:26:10,888
 God in the church unto the ministry, from this

306
00:26:10,888 --> 00:26:15,888
 hour take purse or scrip, that goeth forth to

307
00:26:15,888 --> 00:26:20,888
 proclaim this gospel of the kingdom

308
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:25,179
87 Behold, I send you out to reprove the world of

309
00:26:25,179 --> 00:26:30,179
 all their unrighteous deeds, and to teach them of

310
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:35,179
 a judgment which is to come

311
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:41,528
88 And whoso receiveth you, there I will be also,

312
00:26:41,528 --> 00:26:47,128
 for I will go before your face. I will be on your

313
00:26:47,128 --> 00:26:52,728
 right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall

314
00:26:52,728 --> 00:26:58,328
 be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you,

315
00:26:58,328 --> 00:27:03,928
 to bear you up

316
00:27:03,906 --> 00:27:07,239
89 Whoso receiveth you receiveth me; and the same

317
00:27:07,239 --> 00:27:10,572
 will feed you, and clothe you, and give you money

318
00:27:10,572 --> 00:27:13,905


319
00:27:13,916 --> 00:27:18,916
90 And he who feeds you, or clothes you, or gives

320
00:27:18,916 --> 00:27:23,916
 you money, shall in nowise lose his reward

321
00:27:23,692 --> 00:27:30,192
91 And he that doeth not these things is not my

322
00:27:30,192 --> 00:27:36,692
 disciple; by this you may know my disciples

323
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:41,821
92 He that receiveth you not, go away from him

324
00:27:41,821 --> 00:27:47,421
 alone by yourselves, and cleanse your feet even with

325
00:27:47,421 --> 00:27:53,021
 water, pure water, whether in heat or in cold, and

326
00:27:53,021 --> 00:27:58,621
 bear testimony of it unto your Father which is in

327
00:27:58,621 --> 00:28:04,221
 heaven, and return not again unto that man

328
00:28:04,199 --> 00:28:08,699
93 And in whatsoever village or city ye enter, do

329
00:28:08,699 --> 00:28:13,199
 likewise

330
00:28:13,508 --> 00:28:18,758
94 Nevertheless, search diligently and spare not;

331
00:28:18,758 --> 00:28:24,008
 and wo unto that house, or that village or city

332
00:28:24,008 --> 00:28:29,258
 that rejecteth you, or your words, or your testimony

333
00:28:29,258 --> 00:28:34,508
 concerning me

334
00:28:34,78 --> 00:28:40,113
95 Wo, I say again, unto that house, or that

335
00:28:40,113 --> 00:28:45,446
 village or city that rejecteth you, or your words, or

336
00:28:45,446 --> 00:28:50,779
 your testimony of me

337
00:28:50,045 --> 00:28:55,045
96 For I, the Almighty, have laid my hands upon

338
00:28:55,045 --> 00:29:00,045
 the nations, to scourge them for their wickedness

339
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:07,155
97 And plagues shall go forth, and they shall not

340
00:29:07,155 --> 00:29:13,488
 be taken from the earth until I have completed my

341
00:29:13,488 --> 00:29:19,821
 work, which shall be cut short in righteousness

342
00:29:19,608 --> 00:29:25,408
98 Until all shall know me, who remain, even from

343
00:29:25,408 --> 00:29:31,208
 the least unto the greatest, and shall be filled

344
00:29:31,208 --> 00:29:37,008
 with the knowledge of the Lord, and shall see eye

345
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:42,808
 to eye, and shall lift up their voice, and with the

346
00:29:42,808 --> 00:29:48,608
 voice together sing this new song, saying

347
00:29:48,37 --> 00:29:55,87
99 The Lord hath brought again Zion;The Lord hath

348
00:29:55,87 --> 00:30:03,37
 redeemed his people, Israel,According to the

349
00:30:03,37 --> 00:30:10,87
 election of grace,Which was brought to pass by the

350
00:30:10,87 --> 00:30:18,37
 faithAnd covenant of their fathers

351
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:22,516
100 The Lord hath redeemed his people;And Satan is

352
00:30:22,516 --> 00:30:26,916
 bound and time is no longer.The Lord hath

353
00:30:26,916 --> 00:30:31,316
 gathered all things in one.The Lord hath brought down

354
00:30:31,316 --> 00:30:35,716
 Zion from above.The Lord hath brought up Zion from

355
00:30:35,716 --> 00:30:40,116
 beneath

356
00:30:40,105 --> 00:30:45,705
101 The earth hath travailed and brought forth her

357
00:30:45,705 --> 00:30:51,305
 strength;And truth is established in her

358
00:30:51,305 --> 00:30:56,905
 bowels;And the heavens have smiled upon her;And she is

359
00:30:56,905 --> 00:31:02,505
 clothed with the glory of her God;For he stands in

360
00:31:02,505 --> 00:31:08,105
 the midst of his people

361
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:14,367
102 Glory, and honor, and power, and might,Be

362
00:31:14,367 --> 00:31:19,867
 ascribed to our God; for he is full of mercy,Justice,

363
00:31:19,867 --> 00:31:25,367
 grace and truth, and peace,Forever and ever, Amen

364
00:31:25,367 --> 00:31:30,867


365
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:34,603
103 And again, verily, verily, I say unto you, it

366
00:31:34,603 --> 00:31:38,317
 is expedient that every man who goes forth to

367
00:31:38,317 --> 00:31:42,031
 proclaim mine everlasting gospel, that inasmuch as

368
00:31:42,031 --> 00:31:45,745
 they have families, and receive money by gift, that

369
00:31:45,745 --> 00:31:49,459
 they should send it unto them or make use of it for

370
00:31:49,459 --> 00:31:53,173
 their benefit, as the Lord shall direct them, for

371
00:31:53,173 --> 00:31:56,887
 thus it seemeth me good

372
00:31:56,648 --> 00:32:01,848
104 And let all those who have not families, who

373
00:32:01,848 --> 00:32:07,048
 receive money, send it up unto the bishop in Zion,

374
00:32:07,048 --> 00:32:12,248
 or unto the bishop in Ohio, that it may be

375
00:32:12,248 --> 00:32:17,448
 consecrated for the bringing forth of the revelations and

376
00:32:17,448 --> 00:32:22,648
 the printing thereof, and for establishing Zion

377
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:27,074
105 And if any man shall give unto any of you a

378
00:32:27,074 --> 00:32:31,741
 coat, or a suit, take the old and cast it unto the

379
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:36,408
 poor, and go on your way rejoicing

380
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:41,938
106 And if any man among you be strong in the

381
00:32:41,938 --> 00:32:47,188
 Spirit, let him take with him him that is weak, that

382
00:32:47,188 --> 00:32:52,438
 he may be edified in all meekness, that he may

383
00:32:52,438 --> 00:32:57,688
 become strong also

384
00:32:57,459 --> 00:33:01,459
107 Therefore, take with you those who are

385
00:33:01,459 --> 00:33:05,459
 ordained unto the lesser priesthood, and send them before

386
00:33:05,459 --> 00:33:09,459
 you to make appointments, and to prepare the way,

387
00:33:09,459 --> 00:33:13,459
 and to fill appointments that you yourselves are

388
00:33:13,459 --> 00:33:17,459
 not able to fill

389
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:22,962
108 Behold, this is the way that mine apostles, in

390
00:33:22,962 --> 00:33:28,462
 ancient days, built up my church unto me

391
00:33:28,24 --> 00:33:33,44
109 Therefore, let every man stand in his own

392
00:33:33,44 --> 00:33:38,64
 office, and labor in his own calling; and let not the

393
00:33:38,64 --> 00:33:43,84
 head say unto the feet it hath no need of the

394
00:33:43,84 --> 00:33:49,04
 feet; for without the feet how shall the body be able

395
00:33:49,04 --> 00:33:54,24
 to stand

396
00:33:54,249 --> 00:34:00,249
110 Also the body hath need of every member, that

397
00:34:00,249 --> 00:34:06,249
 all may be edified together, that the system may

398
00:34:06,249 --> 00:34:12,249
 be kept perfect

399
00:34:12,534 --> 00:34:16,534
111 And behold, the high priests should travel,

400
00:34:16,534 --> 00:34:20,534
 and also the elders, and also the lesser priests;

401
00:34:20,534 --> 00:34:24,534
 but the deacons and teachers should be appointed to

402
00:34:24,534 --> 00:34:28,534
 watch over the church, to be standing ministers

403
00:34:28,534 --> 00:34:32,534
 unto the church

404
00:34:32,604 --> 00:34:38,104
112 And the bishop, Newel K. Whitney, also should

405
00:34:38,104 --> 00:34:43,604
 travel round about and among all the churches,

406
00:34:43,604 --> 00:34:49,104
 searching after the poor to administer to their wants

407
00:34:49,104 --> 00:34:54,604
 by humbling the rich and the proud

408
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:58,26
113 He should also employ an agent to take charge

409
00:34:58,26 --> 00:35:01,927
 and to do his secular business as he shall direct

410
00:35:01,927 --> 00:35:05,594


411
00:35:05,387 --> 00:35:09,887
114 Nevertheless, let the bishop go unto the city

412
00:35:09,887 --> 00:35:14,387
 of New York, also to the city of Albany, and also

413
00:35:14,387 --> 00:35:18,887
 to the city of Boston, and warn the people of

414
00:35:18,887 --> 00:35:23,387
 those cities with the sound of the gospel, with a loud

415
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:27,887
 voice, of the desolation and utter abolishment

416
00:35:27,887 --> 00:35:32,387
 which await them if they do reject these things

417
00:35:32,147 --> 00:35:35,48
115 For if they do reject these things the hour of

418
00:35:35,48 --> 00:35:38,813
 their judgment is nigh, and their house shall be

419
00:35:38,813 --> 00:35:42,146
 left unto them desolate

420
00:35:42,157 --> 00:35:46,824
116 Let him trust in me and he shall not be

421
00:35:46,824 --> 00:35:51,491
 confounded; and a hair of his head shall not fall to the

422
00:35:51,491 --> 00:35:56,158
 ground unnoticed

423
00:35:56,705 --> 00:36:02,419
117 And verily I say unto you, the rest of my

424
00:36:02,419 --> 00:36:08,133
 servants, go ye forth as your circumstances shall

425
00:36:08,133 --> 00:36:13,847
 permit, in your several callings, unto the great and

426
00:36:13,847 --> 00:36:19,561
 notable cities and villages, reproving the world in

427
00:36:19,561 --> 00:36:25,275
 righteousness of all their unrighteous and

428
00:36:25,275 --> 00:36:30,989
 ungodly deeds, setting forth clearly and understandingly

429
00:36:30,989 --> 00:36:36,703
 the desolation of abomination in the last days

430
00:36:36,978 --> 00:36:44,645
118 For, with you saith the Lord Almighty, I will

431
00:36:44,645 --> 00:36:52,312
 rend their kingdoms; I will not only shake the

432
00:36:52,312 --> 00:36:59,979
 earth, but the starry heavens shall tremble

433
00:36:59,484 --> 00:37:04,484
119 For I, the Lord, have put forth my hand to

434
00:37:04,484 --> 00:37:09,484
 exert the powers of heaven; ye cannot see it now, yet

435
00:37:09,484 --> 00:37:14,484
 a little while and ye shall see it, and know that

436
00:37:14,484 --> 00:37:19,484
 I am, and that I will come and reign with my

437
00:37:19,484 --> 00:37:24,484
 people

438
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:29,008
120 I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the

439
00:37:29,008 --> 00:37:34,008
 end. Amen.
