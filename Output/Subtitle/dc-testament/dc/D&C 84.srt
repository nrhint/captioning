season of joy that the following communication was

8

care for their needs;

restoration of his people, as he has spoken

35
03:55:36,0 --> 03:55:36,0
by the mouth of his prophets, and for the

36
03:55:36,0 --> 03:55:36,0
gathering of his saints to stand upon Mount

37
03:55:36,0 --> 04:00:41,

45
04:18:43,0 --> 04:18:43,0
Lord, that the city New Jerusalem shall

46
04:18:43,0 --> 04:18:43,0

04:29:44,0 --> 04:29:44,0
a cloud shall rest upon it, which

54
04:29:44,0 --> 04:29:44,0
cloud shall be even the glory of

55
04:29:44,0 --> 04:58:46,
the Lord, which shall fill the house.
