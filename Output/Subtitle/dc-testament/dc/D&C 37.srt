00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:18,678
Section 37 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:18,678 --> 00:00:26,078
 Prophet and Sidney Rigdon, near Fayette, New York,

3
00:00:26,078 --> 00:00:33,478
 December 1830. Herein is given the first

4
00:00:33,478 --> 00:00:40,878
 commandment concerning a gathering in this dispensation.

5
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:48,278
1â€“4, The Saints are called to gather at the Ohio.

6
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:52,465
1 Behold, I say unto you that it is not expedient

7
00:00:52,465 --> 00:00:56,715
 in me that ye should translate any more until ye

8
00:00:56,715 --> 00:01:00,965
 shall go to the Ohio, and this because of the enemy

9
00:01:00,965 --> 00:01:05,215
 and for your sakes

10
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:10,532
2 And again, I say unto you that ye shall not go

11
00:01:10,532 --> 00:01:15,332
 until ye have preached my gospel in those parts,

12
00:01:15,332 --> 00:01:20,132
 and have strengthened up the church whithersoever it

13
00:01:20,132 --> 00:01:24,932
 is found, and more especially in Colesville; for,

14
00:01:24,932 --> 00:01:29,732
 behold, they pray unto me in much faith

15
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:33,423
3 And again, a commandment I give unto the church,

16
00:01:33,423 --> 00:01:37,423
 that it is expedient in me that they should

17
00:01:37,423 --> 00:01:41,423
 assemble together at the Ohio, against the time that my

18
00:01:41,423 --> 00:01:45,423
 servant Oliver Cowdery shall return unto them

19
00:01:45,973 --> 00:01:49,973
4 Behold, here is wisdom, and let every man choose

20
00:01:49,973 --> 00:01:53,973
 for himself until I come. Even so. Amen.
