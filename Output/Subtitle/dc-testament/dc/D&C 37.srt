00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:09,4
Section 37 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:09,4 --> 00:00:18,8
Prophet and Sidney Rigdon, near Fayette, New York,

3
00:00:18,8 --> 00:00:28,2
December 1830. Herein is given the first

4
00:00:28,2 --> 00:00:37,6
commandment concerning a gathering in this dispensation.

5
00:00:37,6 --> 00:00:47,381
1â€“4, The Saints are called to gather at the Ohio. 

6
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:51,631
1 Behold, I say unto you that it is not

7
00:00:51,631 --> 00:00:55,881
expedient in me that ye should translate any

8
00:00:55,881 --> 00:01:00,131
more until ye shall go to the Ohio, and

9
00:01:00,131 --> 00:01:04,798
this because of the enemy and for your sakes.

10
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:08,631
2 And again, I say unto you that ye

11
00:01:08,631 --> 00:01:12,464
shall not go until ye have preached my

12
00:01:12,464 --> 00:01:16,297
gospel in those parts, and have strengthened

13
00:01:16,297 --> 00:01:20,13
up the church whithersoever it is found,

14
00:01:20,13 --> 00:01:23,963
and more especially in Colesville; for,

15
00:01:23,963 --> 00:01:27,087
behold, they pray unto me in much faith.

16
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:30,687
3 And again, a commandment I give unto

17
00:01:30,687 --> 00:01:34,287
the church, that it is expedient in me

18
00:01:34,287 --> 00:01:37,887
that they should assemble together at

19
00:01:37,887 --> 00:01:41,487
the Ohio, against the time that my

20
00:01:41,487 --> 00:01:45,439
servant Oliver Cowdery shall return unto them.

21
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:45,106
4 Behold, here is wisdom, and

22
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:44,773
let every man choose for

23
00:01:44,773 --> 00:01:44,504
himself until I come. Even so. Amen.
