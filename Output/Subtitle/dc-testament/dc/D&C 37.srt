00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 37 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Prophet and Sidney Rigdon, near Fayette, New York,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
December 1830. Herein is given the first

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
commandment concerning a gathering in this dispensation.

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:23:40,
1â€“4, The Saints are called to gather at the Ohio. 

6
00:23:40,0 --> 00:23:40,0
1 Behold, I say unto you that it is not

7
00:23:40,0 --> 00:23:40,0
expedient in me that ye should translate any

8
00:23:40,0 --> 00:23:40,0
more until ye shall go to the Ohio, and

9
00:23:40,0 --> 00:31:52,
this because of the enemy and for your sakes.

10
00:31:52,0 --> 00:31:52,0
2 And again, I say unto you that ye

11
00:31:52,0 --> 00:31:52,0
shall not go until ye have preached my

12
00:31:52,0 --> 00:31:52,0
gospel in those parts, and have strengthened

13
00:31:52,0 --> 00:31:52,0
up the church whithersoever it is found,

14
00:31:52,0 --> 00:31:52,0
and more especially in Colesville; for,

15
00:31:52,0 --> 00:44:03,
behold, they pray unto me in much faith.

16
00:44:03,0 --> 00:44:03,0
3 And again, a commandment I give unto

17
00:44:03,0 --> 00:44:03,0
the church, that it is expedient in me

18
00:44:03,0 --> 00:44:03,0
that they should assemble together at

19
00:44:03,0 --> 00:44:03,0
the Ohio, against the time that my

20
00:44:03,0 --> 00:52:15,
servant Oliver Cowdery shall return unto them.

21
00:52:15,0 --> 00:52:15,0
4 Behold, here is wisdom, and

22
00:52:15,0 --> 00:52:15,0
let every man choose for

23
00:52:15,0 --> 01:01:11,
himself until I come. Even so. Amen.
