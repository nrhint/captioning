00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 29 Revelation given through Joseph

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Smith the Prophet, in the presence of six elders,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
at Fayette, New York, September 1830. This

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
revelation was given some days prior to the

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
conference, beginning September 26, 1830. 
1–8, Christ

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
gathers His elect; 
9–11, His coming ushers in

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Millennium; 
12–13, The Twelve will judge

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
all Israel; 
14–21, Signs, plagues, and

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
desolations will precede the Second Coming; 
22–28, The

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
last resurrection and final judgment follow

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Millennium; 
29–35, All things are spiritual

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
unto the Lord; 
36–39, The devil and his hosts

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
were cast out of heaven to tempt man; 
40–45,

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
The Fall and Atonement bring salvation; 
46–50,

15
00:00:00,0 --> 01:09:55,
Little children are redeemed through the Atonement. 

16
01:09:55,0 --> 01:09:55,0
1 Listen to the voice of Jesus Christ,

17
01:09:55,0 --> 01:09:55,0
your Redeemer, the Great I Am, whose

18
01:09:55,0 --> 01:16:50,
arm of mercy hath atoned for your sins;

19
01:16:50,0 --> 01:16:50,0
2 Who will gather his people

20
01:16:50,0 --> 01:16:50,0
even as a hen gathereth her

21
01:16:50,0 --> 01:16:50,0
chickens under her wings, even as

22
01:16:50,0 --> 01:16:50,0
many as will hearken to my voice

23
01:16:50,0 --> 01:16:50,0
and humble themselves before

24
01:16:50,0 --> 01:21:03,
me, and call upon me in mighty prayer.

25
01:21:03,0 --> 01:21:03,0
3 Behold, verily, verily, I

26
01:21:03,0 --> 01:21:03,0
say unto you, that at this time

27
01:21:03,0 --> 01:21:03,0
your sins are forgiven you,

28
01:21:03,0 --> 01:21:03,0
therefore ye receive these

29
01:21:03,0 --> 01:21:03,0
things; but remember to sin no

30
01:21:03,0 --> 01:41:12,
more, lest perils shall come upon you.

31
01:41:12,0 --> 01:41:12,0
4 Verily, I say unto you

32
01:41:12,0 --> 01:41:12,0
that ye are chosen out of the

33
01:41:12,0 --> 01:41:12,0
world to declare my gospel

34
01:41:12,0 --> 01:41:12,0
with the sound of rejoicing,

35
01:41:12,0 --> 01:56:19,
as with the voice of a trump.

36
01:56:19,0 --> 01:56:19,0
5 Lift up your hearts

37
01:56:19,0 --> 01:56:19,0
and be glad, for I am in

38
01:56:19,0 --> 01:56:19,0
your midst, and am your

39
01:56:19,0 --> 01:56:19,0
advocate with the Father;

40
01:56:19,0 --> 01:56:19,0
and it is his good will

41
01:56:19,0 --> 02:05:29,
to give you the kingdom.

42
02:05:29,0 --> 02:05:29,0
6 And, as it is

43
02:05:29,0 --> 02:05:29,0
written—Whatsoever ye

44
02:05:29,0 --> 02:05:29,0
shall ask in faith,

45
02:05:29,0 --> 02:05:29,0
being united in prayer

46
02:05:29,0 --> 02:05:29,0
according to my

47
02:05:29,0 --> 02:14:11,
command, ye shall receive.

48
02:14:11,0 --> 02:14:11,0
7 And ye are

49
02:14:11,0 --> 02:14:11,0
called to bring to

50
02:14:11,0 --> 02:14:11,0
pass the gathering

51
02:14:11,0 --> 02:14:11,0
of mine elect;

52
02:14:11,0 --> 02:14:11,0
for mine elect hear

53
02:14:11,0 --> 02:14:11,0
my voice and

54
02:14:11,0 --> 02:21:55,
harden not their hearts;

55
02:21:55,0 --> 02:21:55,0
8 Wherefore the

56
02:21:55,0 --> 02:21:55,0
decree hath gone

57
02:21:55,0 --> 02:21:55,0
forth from the

58
02:21:55,0 --> 02:21:55,0
Father that they

59
02:21:55,0 --> 02:21:55,0
shall be

60
02:21:55,0 --> 02:21:55,0
gathered in unto one

61
02:21:55,0 --> 02:21:55,0
place upon the

62
02:21:55,0 --> 02:21:55,0
face of this land,

63
02:21:55,0 --> 02:21:55,0
to prepare

64
02:21:55,0 --> 02:21:55,0
their hearts and be

65
02:21:55,0 --> 02:21:55,0
prepared in all

66
02:21:55,0 --> 02:21:55,0
things against

67
02:21:55,0 --> 02:21:55,0
the day when

68
02:21:55,0 --> 02:21:55,0
tribulation and

69
02:21:55,0 --> 02:21:55,0
desolation are sent

70
02:21:55,0 --> 02:32:05,
forth upon the wicked.

71
02:32:05,0 --> 02:32:05,0
9 For the hour

72
02:32:05,0 --> 02:32:05,0
is nigh and the

73
02:32:05,0 --> 02:32:05,0
day soon at

74
02:32:05,0 --> 02:32:05,0
hand when the

75
02:32:05,0 --> 02:32:05,0
earth is ripe; and

76
02:32:05,0 --> 02:32:05,0
all the proud

77
02:32:05,0 --> 02:32:05,0
and they that

78
02:32:05,0 --> 02:32:05,0
do wickedly

79
02:32:05,0 --> 02:32:05,0
shall be as

80
02:32:05,0 --> 02:32:05,0
stubble; and I will

81
02:32:05,0 --> 02:32:05,0
burn them up,

82
02:32:05,0 --> 02:32:05,0
saith the Lord of

83
02:32:05,0 --> 02:32:05,0
Hosts, that

84
02:32:05,0 --> 02:32:05,0
wickedness shall

85
02:32:05,0 --> 02:46:14,
not be upon the earth;

86
02:46:14,0 --> 02:46:14,0
10 For the

87
02:46:14,0 --> 02:46:14,0
hour is nigh, and

88
02:46:14,0 --> 02:46:14,0
that which

89
02:46:14,0 --> 02:46:14,0
was spoken by

90
02:46:14,0 --> 02:46:14,0
mine apostles

91
02:46:14,0 --> 02:46:14,0
must be

92
02:46:14,0 --> 02:46:14,0
fulfilled; for as they

93
02:46:14,0 --> 02:46:14,0
spoke so

94
02:46:14,0 --> 03:11:20,
shall it come to pass;

95
03:11:20,0 --> 03:11:20,0
11 For I will

96
03:11:20,0 --> 03:11:20,0
reveal

97
03:11:20,0 --> 03:11:20,0
myself from heaven

98
03:11:20,0 --> 03:11:20,0
with power

99
03:11:20,0 --> 03:11:20,0
and great

100
03:11:20,0 --> 03:11:20,0
glory, with all

101
03:11:20,0 --> 03:11:20,0
the hosts

102
03:11:20,0 --> 03:11:20,0
thereof, and

103
03:11:20,0 --> 03:11:20,0
dwell in

104
03:11:20,0 --> 03:11:20,0
righteousness with

105
03:11:20,0 --> 03:11:20,0
men on earth a

106
03:11:20,0 --> 03:11:20,0
thousand

107
03:11:20,0 --> 03:11:20,0
years, and the

108
03:11:20,0 --> 03:22:49,
wicked shall not stand.

109
03:22:49,0 --> 03:22:49,0
12 And

110
03:22:49,0 --> 03:22:49,0
again, verily,

111
03:22:49,0 --> 03:22:49,0
verily, I say

112
03:22:49,0 --> 03:22:49,0
unto you,

113
03:22:49,0 --> 03:22:49,0
and it hath

114
03:22:49,0 --> 03:22:49,0
gone forth in

115
03:22:49,0 --> 03:22:49,0
a firm

116
03:22:49,0 --> 03:22:49,0
decree, by the

117
03:22:49,0 --> 03:22:49,0
will of the

118
03:22:49,0 --> 03:22:49,0
Father, that

119
03:22:49,0 --> 03:22:49,0
mine

120
03:22:49,0 --> 03:22:49,0
apostles, the Twelve

121
03:22:49,0 --> 03:22:49,0
which were

122
03:22:49,0 --> 03:22:49,0
with me in

123
03:22:49,0 --> 03:22:49,0
my ministry

124
03:22:49,0 --> 03:22:49,0
at Jerusalem,

125
03:22:49,0 --> 03:22:49,0
shall stand

126
03:22:49,0 --> 03:22:49,0
at my right

127
03:22:49,0 --> 03:22:49,0
hand at the

128
03:22:49,0 --> 03:22:49,0
day of my

129
03:22:49,0 --> 03:22:49,0
coming in a

130
03:22:49,0 --> 03:22:49,0
pillar of

131
03:22:49,0 --> 03:22:49,0
fire, being

132
03:22:49,0 --> 03:22:49,0
clothed with

133
03:22:49,0 --> 03:22:49,0
robes of

134
03:22:49,0 --> 03:22:49,0
righteousness,

135
03:22:49,0 --> 03:22:49,0
with crowns

136
03:22:49,0 --> 03:22:49,0
upon their

137
03:22:49,0 --> 03:22:49,0
heads, in glory

138
03:22:49,0 --> 03:22:49,0
even as I

139
03:22:49,0 --> 03:22:49,0
am, to judge

140
03:22:49,0 --> 03:22:49,0
the whole

141
03:22:49,0 --> 03:22:49,0
house of

142
03:22:49,0 --> 03:22:49,0
Israel, even as

143
03:22:49,0 --> 03:22:49,0
many as have

144
03:22:49,0 --> 03:22:49,0
loved me and

145
03:22:49,0 --> 03:28:00,
kept my commandments, and none else.

146
03:28:00,0 --> 03:28:00,0
13 For a

147
03:28:00,0 --> 03:28:00,0
trump shall

148
03:28:00,0 --> 03:28:00,0
sound both long

149
03:28:00,0 --> 03:28:00,0
and loud,

150
03:28:00,0 --> 03:28:00,0
even as upon

151
03:28:00,0 --> 03:28:00,0
Mount Sinai,

152
03:28:00,0 --> 03:28:00,0
and all the

153
03:28:00,0 --> 03:28:00,0
earth shall

154
03:28:00,0 --> 03:28:00,0
quake, and

155
03:28:00,0 --> 03:28:00,0
they shall

156
03:28:00,0 --> 03:28:00,0
come

157
03:28:00,0 --> 03:28:00,0
forth—yea, even the

158
03:28:00,0 --> 03:28:00,0
dead which

159
03:28:00,0 --> 03:28:00,0
died in me,

160
03:28:00,0 --> 03:28:00,0
to receive a

161
03:28:00,0 --> 03:28:00,0
crown of

162
03:28:00,0 --> 03:28:00,0
righteousness,

163
03:28:00,0 --> 03:28:00,0
and to be

164
03:28:00,0 --> 03:28:00,0
clothed upon,

165
03:28:00,0 --> 03:28:00,0
even as I

166
03:28:00,0 --> 03:28:00,0
am, to be with

167
03:28:00,0 --> 03:28:00,0
me, that we

168
03:28:00,0 --> 03:33:10,
may be one.

169
03:33:10,0 --> 03:33:10,0
14 But,

170
03:33:10,0 --> 03:33:10,0
behold, I say

171
03:33:10,0 --> 03:33:10,0
unto you

172
03:33:10,0 --> 03:33:10,0
that before

173
03:33:10,0 --> 03:33:10,0
this great

174
03:33:10,0 --> 03:33:10,0
day shall

175
03:33:10,0 --> 03:33:10,0
come the sun

176
03:33:10,0 --> 03:33:10,0
shall be

177
03:33:10,0 --> 03:33:10,0
darkened, and

178
03:33:10,0 --> 03:33:10,0
the moon

179
03:33:10,0 --> 03:33:10,0
shall be

180
03:33:10,0 --> 03:33:10,0
turned into

181
03:33:10,0 --> 03:33:10,0
blood, and

182
03:33:10,0 --> 03:33:10,0
the stars

183
03:33:10,0 --> 03:33:10,0
shall fall

184
03:33:10,0 --> 03:33:10,0
from heaven,

185
03:33:10,0 --> 03:33:10,0
and there

186
03:33:10,0 --> 03:33:10,0
shall be

187
03:33:10,0 --> 03:33:10,0
greater signs

188
03:33:10,0 --> 03:33:10,0
in heaven

189
03:33:10,0 --> 03:38:21,
above and in the earth beneath;

190
03:38:21,0 --> 03:38:21,0
15 And

191
03:38:21,0 --> 03:38:21,0
there shall

192
03:38:21,0 --> 03:38:21,0
be weeping

193
03:38:21,0 --> 03:38:21,0
and

194
03:38:21,0 --> 03:38:21,0
wailing among

195
03:38:21,0 --> 04:08:25,
the hosts of men;

196
04:08:25,0 --> 04:08:25,0
16 And

197
04:08:25,0 --> 04:08:25,0
there shall

198
04:08:25,0 --> 04:08:25,0
be a

199
04:08:25,0 --> 04:08:25,0
great

200
04:08:25,0 --> 04:08:25,0
hailstorm sent

201
04:08:25,0 --> 04:08:25,0
forth to

202
04:08:25,0 --> 04:08:25,0
destroy

203
04:08:25,0 --> 04:08:25,0
the crops

204
04:08:25,0 --> 04:28:34,
of the earth.

205
04:28:34,0 --> 04:28:34,0
17 And

206
04:28:34,0 --> 04:28:34,0
it shall

207
04:28:34,0 --> 04:28:34,0
come to

208
04:28:34,0 --> 04:28:34,0
pass,

209
04:28:34,0 --> 04:28:34,0
because of

210
04:28:34,0 --> 04:28:34,0
the

211
04:28:34,0 --> 04:28:34,0
wickedness

212
04:28:34,0 --> 04:28:34,0
of the

213
04:28:34,0 --> 04:28:34,0
world,

214
04:28:34,0 --> 04:28:34,0
that I

215
04:28:34,0 --> 04:28:34,0
will take

216
04:28:34,0 --> 04:28:34,0
vengeance

217
04:28:34,0 --> 04:28:34,0
upon

218
04:28:34,0 --> 04:28:34,0
the

219
04:28:34,0 --> 04:28:34,0
wicked, for

220
04:28:34,0 --> 04:28:34,0
they will

221
04:28:34,0 --> 04:28:34,0
not

222
04:28:34,0 --> 04:28:34,0
