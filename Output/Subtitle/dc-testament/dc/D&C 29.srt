1
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:19,945
Section 29 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:19,945 --> 00:00:28,612
 the Prophet, in the presence of six elders, at

3
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:37,279
 Fayette, New York, September 1830. This revelation was

4
00:00:37,279 --> 00:00:45,946
 given some days prior to the conference,

5
00:00:45,946 --> 00:00:54,613
 beginning September 26, 1830. 
1–8, Christ gathers His

6
00:00:54,613 --> 00:01:03,28
 elect; 
9–11, His coming ushers in the Millennium;

7
00:01:03,28 --> 00:01:11,947
12–13, The Twelve will judge all Israel; 
14–21,

8
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:20,614
 Signs, plagues, and desolations will precede the

9
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:29,281
 Second Coming; 
22–28, The last resurrection and

10
00:01:29,281 --> 00:01:37,948
 final judgment follow the Millennium; 
29–35, All

11
00:01:37,948 --> 00:01:46,615
 things are spiritual unto the Lord; 
36–39, The devil

12
00:01:46,615 --> 00:01:55,282
 and his hosts were cast out of heaven to tempt

13
00:01:55,282 --> 00:02:03,949
 man; 
40–45, The Fall and Atonement bring salvation;

14
00:02:03,949 --> 00:02:12,616
46–50, Little children are redeemed through the

15
00:02:12,616 --> 00:02:21,283
 Atonement.

16
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:28,674
1 Listen to the voice of Jesus Christ, your

17
00:02:28,674 --> 00:02:36,007
 Redeemer, the Great I Am, whose arm of mercy hath atoned

18
00:02:36,007 --> 00:02:43,34
 for your sins

19
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:53,296
2 Who will gather his people even as a hen

20
00:02:53,296 --> 00:03:03,296
 gathereth her chickens under her wings, even as many as

21
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:13,296
 will hearken to my voice and humble themselves

22
00:03:13,296 --> 00:03:23,296
 before me, and call upon me in mighty prayer

23
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:31,037
3 Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, that at

24
00:03:31,037 --> 00:03:38,537
 this time your sins are forgiven you, therefore ye

25
00:03:38,537 --> 00:03:46,037
 receive these things; but remember to sin no

26
00:03:46,037 --> 00:03:53,537
 more, lest perils shall come upon you

27
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:59,467
4 Verily, I say unto you that ye are chosen out of

28
00:03:59,467 --> 00:04:05,467
 the world to declare my gospel with the sound of

29
00:04:05,467 --> 00:04:11,467
 rejoicing, as with the voice of a trump

30
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:17,485
5 Lift up your hearts and be glad, for I am in

31
00:04:17,485 --> 00:04:23,485
 your midst, and am your advocate with the Father; and

32
00:04:23,485 --> 00:04:29,485
 it is his good will to give you the kingdom

33
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:34,236
6 And, as it is written—Whatsoever ye shall ask in

34
00:04:34,236 --> 00:04:39,236
 faith, being united in prayer according to my

35
00:04:39,236 --> 00:04:44,236
 command, ye shall receive

36
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:51,951
7 And ye are called to bring to pass the gathering

37
00:04:51,951 --> 00:04:58,951
 of mine elect; for mine elect hear my voice and

38
00:04:58,951 --> 00:05:05,951
 harden not their hearts

39
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:09,905
8 Wherefore the decree hath gone forth from the

40
00:05:09,905 --> 00:05:14,572
 Father that they shall be gathered in unto one place

41
00:05:14,572 --> 00:05:19,239
 upon the face of this land, to prepare their

42
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:23,906
 hearts and be prepared in all things against the day

43
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:28,573
 when tribulation and desolation are sent forth upon

44
00:05:28,573 --> 00:05:33,24
 the wicked

45
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:43,733
9 For the hour is nigh and the day soon at hand

46
00:05:43,733 --> 00:05:53,733
 when the earth is ripe; and all the proud and they

47
00:05:53,733 --> 00:06:03,733
 that do wickedly shall be as stubble; and I will

48
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:13,733
 burn them up, saith the Lord of Hosts, that

49
00:06:13,733 --> 00:06:23,733
 wickedness shall not be upon the earth

50
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:31,584
10 For the hour is nigh, and that which was spoken

51
00:06:31,584 --> 00:06:39,251
 by mine apostles must be fulfilled; for as they

52
00:06:39,251 --> 00:06:46,918
 spoke so shall it come to pass

53
00:06:46,64 --> 00:06:54,39
11 For I will reveal myself from heaven with power

54
00:06:54,39 --> 00:07:02,14
 and great glory, with all the hosts thereof, and

55
00:07:02,14 --> 00:07:09,89
 dwell in righteousness with men on earth a

56
00:07:09,89 --> 00:07:17,64
 thousand years, and the wicked shall not stand

57
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:23,604
12 And again, verily, verily, I say unto you, and

58
00:07:23,604 --> 00:07:29,604
 it hath gone forth in a firm decree, by the will

59
00:07:29,604 --> 00:07:35,604
 of the Father, that mine apostles, the Twelve which

60
00:07:35,604 --> 00:07:41,604
 were with me in my ministry at Jerusalem, shall

61
00:07:41,604 --> 00:07:47,604
 stand at my right hand at the day of my coming in a

62
00:07:47,604 --> 00:07:53,604
 pillar of fire, being clothed with robes of

63
00:07:53,604 --> 00:07:59,604
 righteousness, with crowns upon their heads, in glory

64
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:05,604
 even as I am, to judge the whole house of Israel,

65
00:08:05,604 --> 00:08:11,604
 even as many as have loved me and kept my

66
00:08:11,604 --> 00:08:17,604
 commandments, and none else

67
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:24,831
13 For a trump shall sound both long and loud,

68
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:31,663
 even as upon Mount Sinai, and all the earth shall

69
00:08:31,663 --> 00:08:38,496
 quake, and they shall come forth—yea, even the dead

70
00:08:38,496 --> 00:08:45,33
 which died in me, to receive a crown of

71
00:08:45,33 --> 00:08:52,163
 righteousness, and to be clothed upon, even as I am, to be

72
00:08:52,163 --> 00:08:58,995
 with me, that we may be one

73
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:04,505
14 But, behold, I say unto you that before this

74
00:09:04,505 --> 00:09:10,305
 great day shall come the sun shall be darkened, and

75
00:09:10,305 --> 00:09:16,105
 the moon shall be turned into blood, and the stars

76
00:09:16,105 --> 00:09:21,905
 shall fall from heaven, and there shall be

77
00:09:21,905 --> 00:09:27,705
 greater signs in heaven above and in the earth beneath

78
00:09:27,2 --> 00:09:30,7
15 And there shall be weeping and wailing among

79
00:09:30,7 --> 00:09:34,2
 the hosts of men

80
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:39,207
16 And there shall be a great hailstorm sent forth

81
00:09:39,207 --> 00:09:44,207
 to destroy the crops of the earth

82
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:50,551
17 And it shall come to pass, because of the

83
00:09:50,551 --> 00:09:56,351
 wickedness of the world, that I will take vengeance

84
00:09:56,351 --> 00:10:02,151
 upon the wicked, for they will not repent; for the

85
00:10:02,151 --> 00:10:07,951
 cup of mine indignation is full; for behold, my

86
00:10:07,951 --> 00:10:13,751
 blood shall not cleanse them if they hear me not

87
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:17,412
18 Wherefore, I the Lord God will send forth flies

88
00:10:17,412 --> 00:10:21,812
 upon the face of the earth, which shall take hold

89
00:10:21,812 --> 00:10:26,212
 of the inhabitants thereof, and shall eat their

90
00:10:26,212 --> 00:10:30,612
 flesh, and shall cause maggots to come in upon

91
00:10:30,612 --> 00:10:35,012
 them

92
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:40,268
19 And their tongues shall be stayed that they

93
00:10:40,268 --> 00:10:45,268
 shall not utter against me; and their flesh shall

94
00:10:45,268 --> 00:10:50,268
 fall from off their bones, and their eyes from their

95
00:10:50,268 --> 00:10:55,268
 sockets

96
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,822
20 And it shall come to pass that the beasts of

97
00:10:58,822 --> 00:11:01,822
 the forest and the fowls of the air shall devour

98
00:11:01,822 --> 00:11:04,822
 them up

99
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:10,364
21 And the great and abominable church, which is

100
00:11:10,364 --> 00:11:16,531
 the whore of all the earth, shall be cast down by

101
00:11:16,531 --> 00:11:22,698
 devouring fire, according as it is spoken by the

102
00:11:22,698 --> 00:11:28,865
 mouth of Ezekiel the prophet, who spoke of these

103
00:11:28,865 --> 00:11:35,032
 things, which have not come to pass but surely must,

104
00:11:35,032 --> 00:11:41,199
 as I live, for abominations shall not reign

105
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:46,618
22 And again, verily, verily, I say unto you that

106
00:11:46,618 --> 00:11:51,368
 when the thousand years are ended, and men again

107
00:11:51,368 --> 00:11:56,118
 begin to deny their God, then will I spare the

108
00:11:56,118 --> 00:12:00,868
 earth but for a little season

109
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:05,153
23 And the end shall come, and the heaven and the

110
00:12:05,153 --> 00:12:10,153
 earth shall be consumed and pass away, and there

111
00:12:10,153 --> 00:12:15,153
 shall be a new heaven and a new earth

112
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:21,401
24 For all old things shall pass away, and all

113
00:12:21,401 --> 00:12:27,401
 things shall become new, even the heaven and the

114
00:12:27,401 --> 00:12:33,401
 earth, and all the fulness thereof, both men and

115
00:12:33,401 --> 00:12:39,401
 beasts, the fowls of the air, and the fishes of the

116
00:12:39,401 --> 00:12:45,401
 sea

117
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:50,098
25 And not one hair, neither mote, shall be lost,

118
00:12:50,098 --> 00:12:55,098
 for it is the workmanship of mine hand

119
00:12:55,642 --> 00:13:03,242
26 But, behold, verily I say unto you, before the

120
00:13:03,242 --> 00:13:10,842
 earth shall pass away, Michael, mine archangel,

121
00:13:10,842 --> 00:13:18,442
 shall sound his trump, and then shall all the dead

122
00:13:18,442 --> 00:13:26,042
 awake, for their graves shall be opened, and they

123
00:13:26,042 --> 00:13:33,642
 shall come forth—yea, even all

124
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:39,546
27 And the righteous shall be gathered on my right

125
00:13:39,546 --> 00:13:45,546
 hand unto eternal life; and the wicked on my left

126
00:13:45,546 --> 00:13:51,546
 hand will I be ashamed to own before the Father

127
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:57,964
28 Wherefore I will say unto them—Depart from me,

128
00:13:57,964 --> 00:14:04,631
 ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the

129
00:14:04,631 --> 00:14:11,298
 devil and his angels

130
00:14:11,25 --> 00:14:16,75
29 And now, behold, I say unto you, never at any

131
00:14:16,75 --> 00:14:22,25
 time have I declared from mine own mouth that they

132
00:14:22,25 --> 00:14:27,75
 should return, for where I am they cannot come,

133
00:14:27,75 --> 00:14:33,25
 for they have no power

134
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:39,259
30 But remember that all my judgments are not

135
00:14:39,259 --> 00:14:44,545
 given unto men; and as the words have gone forth out

136
00:14:44,545 --> 00:14:49,831
 of my mouth even so shall they be fulfilled, that

137
00:14:49,831 --> 00:14:55,117
 the first shall be last, and that the last shall be

138
00:14:55,117 --> 00:15:00,403
 first in all things whatsoever I have created by

139
00:15:00,403 --> 00:15:05,689
 the word of my power, which is the power of my

140
00:15:05,689 --> 00:15:10,975
 Spirit

141
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:17,209
31 For by the power of my Spirit created I them;

142
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:24,209
 yea, all things both spiritual and temporal

143
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:29,491
32 First spiritual, secondly temporal, which is

144
00:15:29,491 --> 00:15:33,991
 the beginning of my work; and again, first temporal,

145
00:15:33,991 --> 00:15:38,491
 and secondly spiritual, which is the last of my

146
00:15:38,491 --> 00:15:42,991
 work

147
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:48,575
33 Speaking unto you that you may naturally

148
00:15:48,575 --> 00:15:54,175
 understand; but unto myself my works have no end,

149
00:15:54,175 --> 00:15:59,775
 neither beginning; but it is given unto you that ye may

150
00:15:59,775 --> 00:16:05,375
 understand, because ye have asked it of me and are

151
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:10,975
 agreed

152
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:17,703
34 Wherefore, verily I say unto you that all

153
00:16:17,703 --> 00:16:24,503
 things unto me are spiritual, and not at any time have

154
00:16:24,503 --> 00:16:31,303
 I given unto you a law which was temporal; neither

155
00:16:31,303 --> 00:16:38,103
 any man, nor the children of men; neither Adam,

156
00:16:38,103 --> 00:16:44,903
 your father, whom I created

157
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:49,936
35 Behold, I gave unto him that he should be an

158
00:16:49,936 --> 00:16:55,736
 agent unto himself; and I gave unto him commandment,

159
00:16:55,736 --> 00:17:01,536
 but no temporal commandment gave I unto him, for

160
00:17:01,536 --> 00:17:07,336
 my commandments are spiritual; they are not

161
00:17:07,336 --> 00:17:13,136
 natural nor temporal, neither carnal nor sensual

162
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:20,266
36 And it came to pass that Adam, being tempted of

163
00:17:20,266 --> 00:17:26,933
 the devil—for, behold, the devil was before Adam,

164
00:17:26,933 --> 00:17:33,6
 for he rebelled against me, saying, Give me thine

165
00:17:33,6 --> 00:17:40,267
 honor, which is my power; and also a third part

166
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:46,934
 of the hosts of heaven turned he away from me

167
00:17:46,934 --> 00:17:53,601
 because of their agency

168
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:57,005
37 And they were thrust down, and thus came the

169
00:17:57,005 --> 00:18:01,005
 devil and his angels

170
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:06,581
38 And, behold, there is a place prepared for them

171
00:18:06,581 --> 00:18:11,581
 from the beginning, which place is hell

172
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:16,357
39 And it must needs be that the devil should

173
00:18:16,357 --> 00:18:21,357
 tempt the children of men, or they could not be agents

174
00:18:21,357 --> 00:18:26,357
 unto themselves; for if they never should have

175
00:18:26,357 --> 00:18:31,357
 bitter they could not know the sweet

176
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:36,277
40 Wherefore, it came to pass that the devil

177
00:18:36,277 --> 00:18:40,677
 tempted Adam, and he partook of the forbidden fruit and

178
00:18:40,677 --> 00:18:45,077
 transgressed the commandment, wherein he became

179
00:18:45,077 --> 00:18:49,477
 subject to the will of the devil, because he

180
00:18:49,477 --> 00:18:53,877
 yielded unto temptation

181
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:57,561
41 Wherefore, I, the Lord God, caused that he

182
00:18:57,561 --> 00:19:01,99
 should be cast out from the Garden of Eden, from my

183
00:19:01,99 --> 00:19:06,419
 presence, because of his transgression, wherein he

184
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:10,848
 became spiritually dead, which is the first death,

185
00:19:10,848 --> 00:19:15,277
 even that same death which is the last death,

186
00:19:15,277 --> 00:19:19,706
 which is spiritual, which shall be pronounced upon the

187
00:19:19,706 --> 00:19:24,135
 wicked when I shall say: Depart, ye cursed

188
00:19:24,33 --> 00:19:30,163
42 But, behold, I say unto you that I, the Lord

189
00:19:30,163 --> 00:19:35,996
 God, gave unto Adam and unto his seed, that they

190
00:19:35,996 --> 00:19:41,829
 should not die as to the temporal death, until I, the

191
00:19:41,829 --> 00:19:47,662
 Lord God, should send forth angels to declare

192
00:19:47,662 --> 00:19:53,495
 unto them repentance and redemption, through faith on

193
00:19:53,495 --> 00:19:59,328
 the name of mine Only Begotten Son

194
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:05,282
43 And thus did I, the Lord God, appoint unto man

195
00:20:05,282 --> 00:20:11,032
 the days of his probation—that by his natural

196
00:20:11,032 --> 00:20:16,782
 death he might be raised in immortality unto eternal

197
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:22,532
 life, even as many as would believe

198
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:28,088
44 And they that believe not unto eternal

199
00:20:28,088 --> 00:20:33,421
 damnation; for they cannot be redeemed from their

200
00:20:33,421 --> 00:20:38,754
 spiritual fall, because they repent not

201
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:44,471
45 For they love darkness rather than light, and

202
00:20:44,471 --> 00:20:50,138
 their deeds are evil, and they receive their wages

203
00:20:50,138 --> 00:20:55,805
 of whom they list to obey

204
00:20:55,588 --> 00:21:01,588
46 But behold, I say unto you, that little

205
00:21:01,588 --> 00:21:07,588
 children are redeemed from the foundation of the world

206
00:21:07,588 --> 00:21:13,588
 through mine Only Begotten

207
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:19,239
47 Wherefore, they cannot sin, for power is not

208
00:21:19,239 --> 00:21:24,906
 given unto Satan to tempt little children, until

209
00:21:24,906 --> 00:21:30,573
 they begin to become accountable before me

210
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:36,122
48 For it is given unto them even as I will,

211
00:21:36,122 --> 00:21:42,122
 according to mine own pleasure, that great things may

212
00:21:42,122 --> 00:21:48,122
 be required at the hand of their fathers

213
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:53,607
49 And, again, I say unto you, that whoso having

214
00:21:53,607 --> 00:21:59,107
 knowledge, have I not commanded to repent

215
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:05,618
50 And he that hath no understanding, it remaineth

216
00:22:05,618 --> 00:22:11,618
 in me to do according as it is written. And now I

217
00:22:11,618 --> 00:22:17,618
 declare no more unto you at this time. Amen.
