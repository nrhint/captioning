00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 30 Revelation given through Joseph

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Smith the Prophet to David Whitmer, Peter Whitmer

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Jr., and John Whitmer, at Fayette, New York,

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
September 1830, following the three-day conference

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
at Fayette, but before the elders of the

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Church had separated. Originally this material was

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
published as three revelations; it was combined

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
into one section by the Prophet for the 1835

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
edition of the Doctrine and Covenants. 
1–4,

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
David Whitmer is chastened for failure to serve

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
diligently; 
5–8, Peter Whitmer Jr. is to

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
accompany Oliver Cowdery on a mission to the Lamanites;

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:43:21,
9–11, John Whitmer is called to preach the gospel. 

14
00:43:21,0 --> 00:43:21,0
1 Behold, I say unto you, David,

15
00:43:21,0 --> 00:43:21,0
that you have feared man and have not

16
00:43:21,0 --> 00:48:32,
relied on me for strength as you ought.

17
00:48:32,0 --> 00:48:32,0
2 But your mind has been on the

18
00:48:32,0 --> 00:48:32,0
things of the earth more than on the

19
00:48:32,0 --> 00:48:32,0
things of me, your Maker, and the

20
00:48:32,0 --> 00:48:32,0
ministry whereunto you have been

21
00:48:32,0 --> 00:48:32,0
called; and you have not given heed

22
00:48:32,0 --> 00:48:32,0
unto my Spirit, and to those who were

23
00:48:32,0 --> 00:48:32,0
set over you, but have been

24
00:48:32,0 --> 00:50:44,
persuaded by those whom I have not commanded.

25
00:50:44,0 --> 00:50:44,0
3 Wherefore, you are left to

26
00:50:44,0 --> 00:50:44,0
inquire for yourself at my

27
00:50:44,0 --> 00:50:44,0
hand, and ponder upon the

28
00:50:44,0 --> 01:07:38,
things which you have received.

29
01:07:38,0 --> 01:07:38,0
4 And your home shall be

30
01:07:38,0 --> 01:07:38,0
at your father’s house,

31
01:07:38,0 --> 01:07:38,0
until I give unto you

32
01:07:38,0 --> 01:07:38,0
further commandments. And you

33
01:07:38,0 --> 01:07:38,0
shall attend to the

34
01:07:38,0 --> 01:07:38,0
ministry in the church, and

35
01:07:38,0 --> 01:07:38,0
before the world, and in

36
01:07:38,0 --> 01:15:22,
the regions round about. Amen.

37
01:15:22,0 --> 01:15:22,0
5 Behold, I say unto

38
01:15:22,0 --> 01:15:22,0
you, Peter, that you shall

39
01:15:22,0 --> 01:15:22,0
take your journey with

40
01:15:22,0 --> 01:15:22,0
your brother Oliver; for

41
01:15:22,0 --> 01:15:22,0
the time has come that

42
01:15:22,0 --> 01:15:22,0
it is expedient in me

43
01:15:22,0 --> 01:15:22,0
that you shall open your

44
01:15:22,0 --> 01:15:22,0
mouth to declare my

45
01:15:22,0 --> 01:15:22,0
gospel; therefore, fear not,

46
01:15:22,0 --> 01:15:22,0
but give heed unto the

47
01:15:22,0 --> 01:15:22,0
words and advice of your

48
01:15:22,0 --> 01:24:32,
brother, which he shall give you.

49
01:24:32,0 --> 01:24:32,0
6 And be you afflicted

50
01:24:32,0 --> 01:24:32,0
in all his afflictions,

51
01:24:32,0 --> 01:24:32,0
ever lifting up your

52
01:24:32,0 --> 01:24:32,0
heart unto me in prayer

53
01:24:32,0 --> 01:24:32,0
and faith, for his and

54
01:24:32,0 --> 01:24:32,0
your deliverance; for I

55
01:24:32,0 --> 01:24:32,0
have given unto him

56
01:24:32,0 --> 01:24:32,0
power to build up my

57
01:24:32,0 --> 01:40:14,
church among the Lamanites;

58
01:40:14,0 --> 01:40:14,0
7 And none have I

59
01:40:14,0 --> 01:40:14,0
appointed to be his

60
01:40:14,0 --> 01:40:14,0
counselor over him in

61
01:40:14,0 --> 01:40:14,0
the church,

62
01:40:14,0 --> 01:40:14,0
concerning church matters,

63
01:40:14,0 --> 01:40:14,0
except it is his

64
01:40:14,0 --> 01:52:25,
brother, Joseph Smith, Jun.

65
01:52:25,0 --> 01:52:25,0
8 Wherefore, give

66
01:52:25,0 --> 01:52:25,0
heed unto these

67
01:52:25,0 --> 01:52:25,0
things and be diligent

68
01:52:25,0 --> 01:52:25,0
in keeping my

69
01:52:25,0 --> 01:52:25,0
commandments, and you

70
01:52:25,0 --> 01:52:25,0
shall be blessed unto

71
01:52:25,0 --> 02:00:37,
eternal life. Amen.

72
02:00:37,0 --> 02:00:37,0
9 Behold, I say

73
02:00:37,0 --> 02:00:37,0
unto you, my

74
02:00:37,0 --> 02:00:37,0
servant John, that

75
02:00:37,0 --> 02:00:37,0
thou shalt commence

76
02:00:37,0 --> 02:00:37,0
from this time

77
02:00:37,0 --> 02:00:37,0
forth to proclaim

78
02:00:37,0 --> 02:00:37,0
my gospel, as with

79
02:00:37,0 --> 02:07:32,
the voice of a trump.

80
02:07:32,0 --> 02:07:32,0
10 And your

81
02:07:32,0 --> 02:07:32,0
labor shall be at

82
02:07:32,0 --> 02:07:32,0
your brother

83
02:07:32,0 --> 02:07:32,0
Philip Burroughs’,

84
02:07:32,0 --> 02:07:32,0
and in that region

85
02:07:32,0 --> 02:07:32,0
round about,

86
02:07:32,0 --> 02:07:32,0
yea, wherever you

87
02:07:32,0 --> 02:07:32,0
can be heard,

88
02:07:32,0 --> 02:07:32,0
until I command

89
02:07:32,0 --> 02:15:44,
you to go from hence.

90
02:15:44,0 --> 02:15:44,0
11 And your

91
02:15:44,0 --> 02:15:44,0
whole labor shall

92
02:15:44,0 --> 02:15:44,0
be in Zion,

93
02:15:44,0 --> 02:15:44,0
with all your

94
02:15:44,0 --> 02:15:44,0
soul, from

95
02:15:44,0 --> 02:15:44,0
henceforth; yea, you

96
02:15:44,0 --> 02:15:44,0
shall ever open

97
02:15:44,0 --> 02:15:44,0
your mouth in my

98
02:15:44,0 --> 02:15:44,0
cause, not

99
02:15:44,0 --> 02:15:44,0
fearing what man

100
02:15:44,0 --> 02:15:44,0
can do, for I am

101
02:15:44,0 --> 02:15:16,
with you. Amen.
