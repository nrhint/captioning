00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:06,615
Section 30 Revelation given through Joseph

2
00:00:06,615 --> 00:00:13,23
Smith the Prophet to David Whitmer, Peter Whitmer

3
00:00:13,23 --> 00:00:19,845
Jr., and John Whitmer, at Fayette, New York,

4
00:00:19,845 --> 00:00:26,46
September 1830, following the three-day conference

5
00:00:26,46 --> 00:00:33,075
at Fayette, but before the elders of the

6
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:39,69
Church had separated. Originally this material was

7
00:00:39,69 --> 00:00:46,305
published as three revelations; it was combined

8
00:00:46,305 --> 00:00:52,92
into one section by the Prophet for the 1835

9
00:00:52,92 --> 00:00:59,535
edition of the Doctrine and Covenants. 
1–4,

10
00:00:59,535 --> 00:01:06,15
David Whitmer is chastened for failure to serve

11
00:01:06,15 --> 00:01:12,765
diligently; 
5–8, Peter Whitmer Jr. is to

12
00:01:12,765 --> 00:01:19,38
accompany Oliver Cowdery on a mission to the Lamanites;

13
00:01:19,38 --> 00:01:26,787
9–11, John Whitmer is called to preach the gospel. 

14
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:31,787
1 Behold, I say unto you, David,

15
00:01:31,787 --> 00:01:36,787
that you have feared man and have not

16
00:01:36,787 --> 00:01:41,802
relied on me for strength as you ought.

17
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:43,552
2 But your mind has been on the

18
00:01:43,552 --> 00:01:45,302
things of the earth more than on the

19
00:01:45,302 --> 00:01:47,052
things of me, your Maker, and the

20
00:01:47,052 --> 00:01:48,802
ministry whereunto you have been

21
00:01:48,802 --> 00:01:50,552
called; and you have not given heed

22
00:01:50,552 --> 00:01:52,302
unto my Spirit, and to those who were

23
00:01:52,302 --> 00:01:54,052
set over you, but have been

24
00:01:54,052 --> 00:01:55,649
persuaded by those whom I have not commanded.

25
00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:00,399
3 Wherefore, you are left to

26
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,149
inquire for yourself at my

27
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:09,899
hand, and ponder upon the

28
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:14,001
things which you have received.

29
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:15,126
4 And your home shall be

30
00:02:15,126 --> 00:02:16,251
at your father’s house,

31
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:17,376
until I give unto you

32
00:02:17,376 --> 00:02:18,501
further commandments. And you

33
00:02:18,501 --> 00:02:19,626
shall attend to the

34
00:02:19,626 --> 00:02:20,751
ministry in the church, and

35
00:02:20,751 --> 00:02:21,876
before the world, and in

36
00:02:21,876 --> 00:02:23,443
the regions round about. Amen.

37
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:24,026
5 Behold, I say unto

38
00:02:24,026 --> 00:02:24,609
you, Peter, that you shall

39
00:02:24,609 --> 00:02:25,192
take your journey with

40
00:02:25,192 --> 00:02:25,775
your brother Oliver; for

41
00:02:25,775 --> 00:02:26,358
the time has come that

42
00:02:26,358 --> 00:02:26,941
it is expedient in me

43
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:27,524
that you shall open your

44
00:02:27,524 --> 00:02:28,107
mouth to declare my

45
00:02:28,107 --> 00:02:28,69
gospel; therefore, fear not,

46
00:02:28,69 --> 00:02:29,273
but give heed unto the

47
00:02:29,273 --> 00:02:29,856
words and advice of your

48
00:02:29,856 --> 00:02:30,951
brother, which he shall give you.

49
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:33,062
6 And be you afflicted

50
00:02:33,062 --> 00:02:35,173
in all his afflictions,

51
00:02:35,173 --> 00:02:37,284
ever lifting up your

52
00:02:37,284 --> 00:02:39,395
heart unto me in prayer

53
00:02:39,395 --> 00:02:41,506
and faith, for his and

54
00:02:41,506 --> 00:02:43,617
your deliverance; for I

55
00:02:43,617 --> 00:02:45,728
have given unto him

56
00:02:45,728 --> 00:02:47,839
power to build up my

57
00:02:47,839 --> 00:02:49,302
church among the Lamanites;

58
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:53,731
7 And none have I

59
00:02:53,731 --> 00:02:58,16
appointed to be his

60
00:02:58,16 --> 00:03:02,589
counselor over him in

61
00:03:02,589 --> 00:03:07,018
the church,

62
00:03:07,018 --> 00:03:11,447
concerning church matters,

63
00:03:11,447 --> 00:03:15,876
except it is his

64
00:03:15,876 --> 00:03:20,734
brother, Joseph Smith, Jun.

65
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:22,591
8 Wherefore, give

66
00:03:22,591 --> 00:03:24,448
heed unto these

67
00:03:24,448 --> 00:03:26,305
things and be diligent

68
00:03:26,305 --> 00:03:28,162
in keeping my

69
00:03:28,162 --> 00:03:30,019
commandments, and you

70
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:31,876
shall be blessed unto

71
00:03:31,876 --> 00:03:33,113
eternal life. Amen.

72
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:33,613
9 Behold, I say

73
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:34,113
unto you, my

74
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:34,613
servant John, that

75
00:03:34,613 --> 00:03:35,113
thou shalt commence

76
00:03:35,113 --> 00:03:35,613
from this time

77
00:03:35,613 --> 00:03:36,113
forth to proclaim

78
00:03:36,113 --> 00:03:36,613
my gospel, as with

79
00:03:36,613 --> 00:03:37,517
the voice of a trump.

80
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:38,317
10 And your

81
00:03:38,317 --> 00:03:39,117
labor shall be at

82
00:03:39,117 --> 00:03:39,917
your brother

83
00:03:39,917 --> 00:03:40,717
Philip Burroughs’,

84
00:03:40,717 --> 00:03:41,517
and in that region

85
00:03:41,517 --> 00:03:42,317
round about,

86
00:03:42,317 --> 00:03:43,117
yea, wherever you

87
00:03:43,117 --> 00:03:43,917
can be heard,

88
00:03:43,917 --> 00:03:44,717
until I command

89
00:03:44,717 --> 00:03:45,959
you to go from hence.

90
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,292
11 And your

91
00:03:47,292 --> 00:03:48,625
whole labor shall

92
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:49,958
be in Zion,

93
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,291
with all your

94
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:52,624
soul, from

95
00:03:52,624 --> 00:03:53,957
henceforth; yea, you

96
00:03:53,957 --> 00:03:55,29
shall ever open

97
00:03:55,29 --> 00:03:56,623
your mouth in my

98
00:03:56,623 --> 00:03:57,956
cause, not

99
00:03:57,956 --> 00:03:59,289
fearing what man

100
00:03:59,289 --> 00:04:00,622
can do, for I am

101
00:04:00,622 --> 00:04:01,441
with you. Amen.
