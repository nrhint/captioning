00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:17,124
Section 30 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:17,124 --> 00:00:22,97
 the Prophet to David Whitmer, Peter Whitmer Jr.,

3
00:00:22,97 --> 00:00:28,816
 and John Whitmer, at Fayette, New York, September

4
00:00:28,816 --> 00:00:34,662
 1830, following the three-day conference at Fayette,

5
00:00:34,662 --> 00:00:40,508
 but before the elders of the Church had

6
00:00:40,508 --> 00:00:46,354
 separated. Originally this material was published as three

7
00:00:46,354 --> 00:00:52,2
 revelations; it was combined into one section by

8
00:00:52,2 --> 00:00:58,046
 the Prophet for the 1835 edition of the Doctrine

9
00:00:58,046 --> 00:01:03,892
 and Covenants. 
1–4, David Whitmer is chastened for

10
00:01:03,892 --> 00:01:09,738
 failure to serve diligently; 
5–8, Peter Whitmer

11
00:01:09,738 --> 00:01:15,584
 Jr. is to accompany Oliver Cowdery on a mission to

12
00:01:15,584 --> 00:01:21,43
 the Lamanites; 
9–11, John Whitmer is called to

13
00:01:21,43 --> 00:01:27,276
 preach the gospel.

14
00:01:27,02 --> 00:01:32,02
1 Behold, I say unto you, David, that you have

15
00:01:32,02 --> 00:01:37,02
 feared man and have not relied on me for strength as

16
00:01:37,02 --> 00:01:42,02
 you ought

17
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:47,535
2 But your mind has been on the things of the

18
00:01:47,535 --> 00:01:53,035
 earth more than on the things of me, your Maker, and

19
00:01:53,035 --> 00:01:58,535
 the ministry whereunto you have been called; and

20
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:04,035
 you have not given heed unto my Spirit, and to those

21
00:02:04,035 --> 00:02:09,535
 who were set over you, but have been persuaded by

22
00:02:09,535 --> 00:02:15,035
 those whom I have not commanded

23
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:21,302
3 Wherefore, you are left to inquire for yourself

24
00:02:21,302 --> 00:02:26,635
 at my hand, and ponder upon the things which you

25
00:02:26,635 --> 00:02:31,968
 have received

26
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:35,685
4 And your home shall be at your father’s house,

27
00:02:35,685 --> 00:02:39,685
 until I give unto you further commandments. And you

28
00:02:39,685 --> 00:02:43,685
 shall attend to the ministry in the church, and

29
00:02:43,685 --> 00:02:47,685
 before the world, and in the regions round about.

30
00:02:47,685 --> 00:02:51,685
 Amen

31
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:56,171
5 Behold, I say unto you, Peter, that you shall

32
00:02:56,171 --> 00:03:01,171
 take your journey with your brother Oliver; for the

33
00:03:01,171 --> 00:03:06,171
 time has come that it is expedient in me that you

34
00:03:06,171 --> 00:03:11,171
 shall open your mouth to declare my gospel;

35
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:16,171
 therefore, fear not, but give heed unto the words and

36
00:03:16,171 --> 00:03:21,171
 advice of your brother, which he shall give you

37
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:26,401
6 And be you afflicted in all his afflictions,

38
00:03:26,401 --> 00:03:31,401
 ever lifting up your heart unto me in prayer and

39
00:03:31,401 --> 00:03:36,401
 faith, for his and your deliverance; for I have given

40
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:41,401
 unto him power to build up my church among the

41
00:03:41,401 --> 00:03:46,401
 Lamanites

42
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:51,393
7 And none have I appointed to be his counselor

43
00:03:51,393 --> 00:03:56,393
 over him in the church, concerning church matters,

44
00:03:56,393 --> 00:04:01,393
 except it is his brother, Joseph Smith, Jun

45
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:06,875
8 Wherefore, give heed unto these things and be

46
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:11,875
 diligent in keeping my commandments, and you shall

47
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:16,875
 be blessed unto eternal life. Amen

48
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:21,489
9 Behold, I say unto you, my servant John, that

49
00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:26,822
 thou shalt commence from this time forth to proclaim

50
00:04:26,822 --> 00:04:32,155
 my gospel, as with the voice of a trump

51
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:37,605
10 And your labor shall be at your brother Philip

52
00:04:37,605 --> 00:04:43,105
 Burroughs’, and in that region round about, yea,

53
00:04:43,105 --> 00:04:48,605
 wherever you can be heard, until I command you to

54
00:04:48,605 --> 00:04:54,105
 go from hence

55
00:04:54,06 --> 00:04:59,81
11 And your whole labor shall be in Zion, with all

56
00:04:59,81 --> 00:05:05,56
 your soul, from henceforth; yea, you shall ever

57
00:05:05,56 --> 00:05:11,31
 open your mouth in my cause, not fearing what man

58
00:05:11,31 --> 00:05:17,06
 can do, for I am with you. Amen.
