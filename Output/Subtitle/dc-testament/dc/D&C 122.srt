Section 122 The word of the Lord to Joseph

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Smith the Prophet, while a prisoner in the jail at

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Liberty, Missouri. This section is an excerpt

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
from an epistle to the Church dated March 20,

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
1839 (see the 
heading to section 121). 
1–4, The

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
ends of the earth will inquire after the name

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of Joseph Smith; 
5–7, All his perils and

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
travails will give him experience and be for his

9
00:00:00,0 --> 01:23:29,
good; 
8–9, The Son of Man has descended below them all. 

10
01:23:29,0 --> 01:23:29,0
1 The ends of the earth shall inquire

11
01:23:29,0 --> 01:23:29,0
after thy name, and fools shall have thee in

12
01:23:29,0 --> 01:37:33,
derision, and hell shall rage against thee;

13
01:37:33,0 --> 01:37:33,0
2 While the pure in heart, and the

14
01:37:33,0 --> 01:37:33,0
wise, and the noble, and the virtuous,

15
01:37:33,0 --> 01:37:33,0
shall seek counsel, and authority, and

16
01:37:33,0 --> 01:49:11,
blessings constantly from under thy hand.

17
01:49:11,0 --> 01:49:11,0
3 And thy people shall

18
01:49:11,0 --> 01:49:11,0
never be turned against thee by

19
01:49:11,0 --> 02:08:11,
the testimony of traitors.

20
02:08:11,0 --> 02:08:11,0
4 And although their

21
02:08:11,0 --> 02:08:11,0
influence shall cast thee

22
02:08:11,0 --> 02:08:11,0
into trouble, and into bars

23
02:08:11,0 --> 02:08:11,0
and walls, thou shalt be

24
02:08:11,0 --> 02:08:11,0
had in honor; and but for

25
02:08:11,0 --> 02:08:11,0
a small moment and thy

26
02:08:11,0 --> 02:08:11,0
voice shall be more

27
02:08:11,0 --> 02:08:11,0
terrible in the midst of thine

28
02:08:11,0 --> 02:08:11,0
enemies than the fierce

29
02:08:11,0 --> 02:08:11,0
lion, because of thy

30
02:08:11,0 --> 02:08:11,0
righteousness; and thy God

31
02:08:11,0 --> 02:20:17,
shall stand by thee forever and ever.

32
02:20:17,0 --> 02:20:17,0
5 If thou art called to

33
02:20:17,0 --> 02:20:17,0
pass through

34
02:20:17,0 --> 02:20:17,0
tribulation; if thou art in perils

35
02:20:17,0 --> 02:20:17,0
among false brethren; if

36
02:20:17,0 --> 02:20:17,0
thou art in perils

37
02:20:17,0 --> 02:20:17,0
among robbers; if thou art

38
02:20:17,0 --> 02:27:20,
in perils by land or by sea;

39
02:27:20,0 --> 02:27:20,0
6 If thou art accused

40
02:27:20,0 --> 02:27:20,0
with all manner of false

41
02:27:20,0 --> 02:27:20,0
accusations; if thine

42
02:27:20,0 --> 02:27:20,0
enemies fall upon thee;

43
02:27:20,0 --> 02:27:20,0
if they tear thee from

44
02:27:20,0 --> 02:27:20,0
the society of thy

45
02:27:20,0 --> 02:27:20,0
father and mother and

46
02:27:20,0 --> 02:27:20,0
brethren and sisters; and

47
02:27:20,0 --> 02:27:20,0
if with a drawn sword

48
02:27:20,0 --> 02:27:20,0
thine enemies tear thee

49
02:27:20,0 --> 02:27:20,0
from the bosom of thy

50
02:27:20,0 --> 02:27:20,0
wife, and of thine

51
02:27:20,0 --> 02:27:20,0
offspring, and thine elder

52
02:27:20,0 --> 02:27:20,0
son, although but six

53
02:27:20,0 --> 02:27:20,0
years of age, shall cling

54
02:27:20,0 --> 02:27:20,0
to thy garments, and

55
02:27:20,0 --> 02:27:20,0
shall say, My father, my

56
02:27:20,0 --> 02:27:20,0
father, why can’t you

57
02:27:20,0 --> 02:27:20,0
stay with us? O, my

58
02:27:20,0 --> 02:27:20,0
father, what are the men

59
02:27:20,0 --> 02:27:20,0
going to do with you? and

60
02:27:20,0 --> 02:27:20,0
if then he shall be

61
02:27:20,0 --> 02:27:20,0
thrust from thee by the

62
02:27:20,0 --> 02:27:20,0
sword, and thou be

63
02:27:20,0 --> 02:27:20,0
dragged to prison, and thine

64
02:27:20,0 --> 02:27:20,0
enemies prowl around

65
02:27:20,0 --> 02:58:20,
thee like wolves for the blood of the lamb;

66
02:58:20,0 --> 02:58:20,0
7 And if thou shouldst

67
02:58:20,0 --> 02:58:20,0
be cast into the pit,

68
02:58:20,0 --> 02:58:20,0
or into the hands of

69
02:58:20,0 --> 02:58:20,0
murderers, and the

70
02:58:20,0 --> 02:58:20,0
sentence of death passed

71
02:58:20,0 --> 02:58:20,0
upon thee; if thou be

72
02:58:20,0 --> 02:58:20,0
cast into the deep; if

73
02:58:20,0 --> 02:58:20,0
the billowing surge

74
02:58:20,0 --> 02:58:20,0
conspire against thee;

75
02:58:20,0 --> 02:58:20,0
if fierce winds become

76
02:58:20,0 --> 02:58:20,0
thine enemy; if the

77
02:58:20,0 --> 02:58:20,0
heavens gather

78
02:58:20,0 --> 02:58:20,0
blackness, and all the

79
02:58:20,0 --> 02:58:20,0
elements combine to hedge up

80
02:58:20,0 --> 02:58:20,0
the way; and above

81
02:58:20,0 --> 02:58:20,0
all, if the very jaws of

82
02:58:20,0 --> 02:58:20,0
hell shall gape open

83
02:58:20,0 --> 02:58:20,0
the mouth wide after

84
02:58:20,0 --> 02:58:20,0
thee, know thou, my son,

85
02:58:20,0 --> 02:58:20,0
that all these things

86
02:58:20,0 --> 02:58:20,0
shall give thee

87
02:58:20,0 --> 03:01:59,
experience, and shall be for thy good.

88
03:01:59,0 --> 03:01:59,0
8 The Son of Man

89
03:01:59,0 --> 03:01:59,0
hath descended

90
03:01:59,0 --> 03:01:59,0
below them all. Art

91
03:01:59,0 --> 03:12:59,
thou greater than he?

92
03:12:59,0 --> 03:12:59,0
9 Therefore, hold

93
03:12:59,0 --> 03:12:59,0
on thy way, and

94
03:12:59,0 --> 03:12:59,0
the priesthood

95
03:12:59,0 --> 03:12:59,0
shall remain with

96
03:12:59,0 --> 03:12:59,0
thee; for their

97
03:12:59,0 --> 03:12:59,0
bounds are set,

98
03:12:59,0 --> 03:12:59,0
they cannot pass.

99
03:12:59,0 --> 03:12:59,0
Thy days are known,

100
03:12:59,0 --> 03:12:59,0
and thy years

101
03:12:59,0 --> 03:12:59,0
shall not be

102
03:12:59,0 --> 03:12:59,0
numbered less;

103
03:12:59,0 --> 03:12:59,0
therefore, fear not what

104
03:12:59,0 --> 03:12:59,0
man can do, for

105
03:12:59,0 --> 03:12:59,0
God shall be with

106
03:12:59,0 --> 03:42:01,
you forever and ever.
