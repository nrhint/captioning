00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:19,389
Section 122 The word of the Lord to Joseph Smith

2
00:00:19,389 --> 00:00:27,5
 the Prophet, while a prisoner in the jail at

3
00:00:27,5 --> 00:00:35,611
 Liberty, Missouri. This section is an excerpt from an

4
00:00:35,611 --> 00:00:43,722
 epistle to the Church dated March 20, 1839 (see the

5
00:00:43,722 --> 00:00:51,833
heading to section 121). 
1–4, The ends of the

6
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:59,944
 earth will inquire after the name of Joseph Smith;

7
00:00:59,944 --> 00:01:08,055
5–7, All his perils and travails will give him

8
00:01:08,055 --> 00:01:16,166
 experience and be for his good; 
8–9, The Son of Man

9
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:24,277
 has descended below them all.

10
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:32,55
1 The ends of the earth shall inquire after thy

11
00:01:32,55 --> 00:01:40,883
 name, and fools shall have thee in derision, and

12
00:01:40,883 --> 00:01:49,216
 hell shall rage against thee

13
00:01:49,493 --> 00:01:54,243
2 While the pure in heart, and the wise, and the

14
00:01:54,243 --> 00:01:58,993
 noble, and the virtuous, shall seek counsel, and

15
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:03,743
 authority, and blessings constantly from under thy

16
00:02:03,743 --> 00:02:08,493
 hand

17
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:14,995
3 And thy people shall never be turned against

18
00:02:14,995 --> 00:02:21,495
 thee by the testimony of traitors

19
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:26,915
4 And although their influence shall cast thee

20
00:02:26,915 --> 00:02:32,772
 into trouble, and into bars and walls, thou shalt be

21
00:02:32,772 --> 00:02:38,629
 had in honor; and but for a small moment and thy

22
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:44,486
 voice shall be more terrible in the midst of thine

23
00:02:44,486 --> 00:02:50,343
 enemies than the fierce lion, because of thy

24
00:02:50,343 --> 00:02:56,2
 righteousness; and thy God shall stand by thee forever

25
00:02:56,2 --> 00:03:02,057
 and ever

26
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:12,815
5 If thou art called to pass through tribulation;

27
00:03:12,815 --> 00:03:23,315
 if thou art in perils among false brethren; if

28
00:03:23,315 --> 00:03:33,815
 thou art in perils among robbers; if thou art in

29
00:03:33,815 --> 00:03:44,315
 perils by land or by sea

30
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:51,862
6 If thou art accused with all manner of false

31
00:03:51,862 --> 00:03:59,4
 accusations; if thine enemies fall upon thee; if they

32
00:03:59,4 --> 00:04:06,938
 tear thee from the society of thy father and

33
00:04:06,938 --> 00:04:14,476
 mother and brethren and sisters; and if with a drawn

34
00:04:14,476 --> 00:04:22,014
 sword thine enemies tear thee from the bosom of thy

35
00:04:22,014 --> 00:04:29,552
 wife, and of thine offspring, and thine elder

36
00:04:29,552 --> 00:04:37,09
 son, although but six years of age, shall cling to

37
00:04:37,09 --> 00:04:44,628
 thy garments, and shall say, My father, my father,

38
00:04:44,628 --> 00:04:52,166
 why can’t you stay with us? O, my father, what are

39
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:59,704
 the men going to do with you? and if then he shall

40
00:04:59,704 --> 00:05:07,242
 be thrust from thee by the sword, and thou be

41
00:05:07,242 --> 00:05:14,78
 dragged to prison, and thine enemies prowl around

42
00:05:14,78 --> 00:05:22,318
 thee like wolves for the blood of the lamb

43
00:05:22,772 --> 00:05:31,172
7 And if thou shouldst be cast into the pit, or

44
00:05:31,172 --> 00:05:39,572
 into the hands of murderers, and the sentence of

45
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:47,972
 death passed upon thee; if thou be cast into the

46
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:56,372
 deep; if the billowing surge conspire against thee; if

47
00:05:56,372 --> 00:06:04,772
 fierce winds become thine enemy; if the heavens

48
00:06:04,772 --> 00:06:13,172
 gather blackness, and all the elements combine to

49
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:21,572
 hedge up the way; and above all, if the very jaws

50
00:06:21,572 --> 00:06:29,972
 of hell shall gape open the mouth wide after thee,

51
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:38,372
 know thou, my son, that all these things shall

52
00:06:38,372 --> 00:06:46,772
 give thee experience, and shall be for thy good

53
00:06:46,99 --> 00:06:53,99
8 The Son of Man hath descended below them all.

54
00:06:53,99 --> 00:07:00,99
 Art thou greater than he

55
00:07:00,52 --> 00:07:07,187
9 Therefore, hold on thy way, and the priesthood

56
00:07:07,187 --> 00:07:13,854
 shall remain with thee; for their bounds are set,

57
00:07:13,854 --> 00:07:20,521
 they cannot pass. Thy days are known, and thy years

58
00:07:20,521 --> 00:07:27,188
 shall not be numbered less; therefore, fear not

59
00:07:27,188 --> 00:07:33,855
 what man can do, for God shall be with you forever

60
00:07:33,855 --> 00:07:40,522
 and ever.
