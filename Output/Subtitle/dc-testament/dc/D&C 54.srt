00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:21,949
Section 54 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:28,282
 the Prophet to Newel Knight, at Kirtland, Ohio,

3
00:00:28,282 --> 00:00:34,615
 June 10, 1831. Members of the Church living in

4
00:00:34,615 --> 00:00:40,948
 Thompson, Ohio, were divided on questions having to do

5
00:00:40,948 --> 00:00:47,281
 with the consecration of properties. Selfishness

6
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:53,614
 and greed were manifest. Following his mission to

7
00:00:53,614 --> 00:00:59,947
 the Shakers (see the 
heading to section 49), Leman

8
00:00:59,947 --> 00:01:06,28
 Copley had broken his covenant to consecrate his

9
00:01:06,28 --> 00:01:12,613
 large farm as a place of inheritance for the Saints

10
00:01:12,613 --> 00:01:18,946
 arriving from Colesville, New York. As a

11
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:25,279
 consequence, Newel Knight (leader of the members living in

12
00:01:25,279 --> 00:01:31,612
 Thompson) and other elders had come to the

13
00:01:31,612 --> 00:01:37,945
 Prophet asking how to proceed. The Prophet inquired of

14
00:01:37,945 --> 00:01:44,278
 the Lord and received this revelation, which

15
00:01:44,278 --> 00:01:50,611
 commands the members in Thompson to leave Leman Copley’s

16
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:56,944
 farm and journey to Missouri. 
1–6, The Saints

17
00:01:56,944 --> 00:02:03,277
 must keep the gospel covenant to gain mercy; 
7–10,

18
00:02:03,277 --> 00:02:09,61
 They must be patient in tribulation.

19
00:02:09,646 --> 00:02:14,646
1 Behold, thus saith the Lord, even Alpha and

20
00:02:14,646 --> 00:02:19,646
 Omega, the beginning and the end, even he who was

21
00:02:19,646 --> 00:02:24,646
 crucified for the sins of the world

22
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:28,078
2 Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, my

23
00:02:28,078 --> 00:02:31,745
 servant Newel Knight, you shall stand fast in the

24
00:02:31,745 --> 00:02:35,412
 office whereunto I have appointed you

25
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:40,788
3 And if your brethren desire to escape their

26
00:02:40,788 --> 00:02:46,121
 enemies, let them repent of all their sins, and become

27
00:02:46,121 --> 00:02:51,454
 truly humble before me and contrite

28
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:54,471
4 And as the covenant which they made unto me has

29
00:02:54,471 --> 00:02:57,471
 been broken, even so it has become void and of

30
00:02:57,471 --> 00:03:00,471
 none effect

31
00:03:00,997 --> 00:03:04,664
5 And wo to him by whom this offense cometh, for

32
00:03:04,664 --> 00:03:08,331
 it had been better for him that he had been drowned

33
00:03:08,331 --> 00:03:11,998
 in the depth of the sea

34
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:15,192
6 But blessed are they who have kept the covenant

35
00:03:15,192 --> 00:03:18,859
 and observed the commandment, for they shall

36
00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:22,526
 obtain mercy

37
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:26,302
7 Wherefore, go to now and flee the land, lest

38
00:03:26,302 --> 00:03:30,302
 your enemies come upon you; and take your journey,

39
00:03:30,302 --> 00:03:34,302
 and appoint whom you will to be your leader, and to

40
00:03:34,302 --> 00:03:38,302
 pay moneys for you

41
00:03:38,835 --> 00:03:42,502
8 And thus you shall take your journey into the

42
00:03:42,502 --> 00:03:46,169
 regions westward, unto the land of Missouri, unto

43
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:49,836
 the borders of the Lamanites

44
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:55,379
9 And after you have done journeying, behold, I

45
00:03:55,379 --> 00:04:01,379
 say unto you, seek ye a living like unto men, until

46
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:07,379
 I prepare a place for you

47
00:04:07,898 --> 00:04:15,148
10 And again, be patient in tribulation until I

48
00:04:15,148 --> 00:04:22,398
 come; and, behold, I come quickly, and my reward is

49
00:04:22,398 --> 00:04:29,648
 with me, and they who have sought me early shall

50
00:04:29,648 --> 00:04:36,898
 find rest to their souls. Even so. Amen.
