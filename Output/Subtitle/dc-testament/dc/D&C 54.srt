00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:02,278
Section 54 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:02,278 --> 00:00:04,556
the Prophet to Newel Knight, at Kirtland, Ohio,

3
00:00:04,556 --> 00:00:06,834
June 10, 1831. Members of the Church living in

4
00:00:06,834 --> 00:00:09,112
Thompson, Ohio, were divided on questions having to

5
00:00:09,112 --> 00:00:11,39
do with the consecration of properties.

6
00:00:11,39 --> 00:00:13,668
Selfishness and greed were manifest. Following his mission

7
00:00:13,668 --> 00:00:15,946
to the Shakers (see the 
heading to section 49),

8
00:00:15,946 --> 00:00:18,224
Leman Copley had broken his covenant to

9
00:00:18,224 --> 00:00:20,502
consecrate his large farm as a place of inheritance for

10
00:00:20,502 --> 00:00:22,78
the Saints arriving from Colesville, New York. As

11
00:00:22,78 --> 00:00:25,058
a consequence, Newel Knight (leader of the

12
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:27,336
members living in Thompson) and other elders had come

13
00:00:27,336 --> 00:00:29,614
to the Prophet asking how to proceed. The Prophet

14
00:00:29,614 --> 00:00:31,892
inquired of the Lord and received this

15
00:00:31,892 --> 00:00:34,17
revelation, which commands the members in Thompson to leave

16
00:00:34,17 --> 00:00:36,448
Leman Copley’s farm and journey to Missouri.

17
00:00:36,448 --> 00:00:38,726
1–6, The Saints must keep the gospel covenant to

18
00:00:38,726 --> 00:00:41,008
gain mercy; 
7–10, They must be patient in tribulation. 

19
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:39,341
1 Behold, thus saith the Lord, even Alpha

20
00:00:39,341 --> 00:00:37,674
and Omega, the beginning and the end, even he

21
00:00:37,674 --> 00:00:36,67
who was crucified for the sins of the world—

22
00:00:36,67 --> 00:00:59,67
2 Behold, verily, verily, I say

23
00:00:59,67 --> 00:01:22,67
unto you, my servant Newel Knight,

24
00:01:22,67 --> 00:01:45,67
you shall stand fast in the

25
00:01:45,67 --> 00:02:08,695
office whereunto I have appointed you.

26
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:11,695
3 And if your brethren

27
00:02:11,695 --> 00:02:14,695
desire to escape their enemies,

28
00:02:14,695 --> 00:02:17,695
let them repent of all

29
00:02:17,695 --> 00:02:20,695
their sins, and become truly

30
00:02:20,695 --> 00:02:23,744
humble before me and contrite.

31
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:25,944
4 And as the covenant

32
00:02:25,944 --> 00:02:28,144
which they made unto

33
00:02:28,144 --> 00:02:30,344
me has been broken,

34
00:02:30,344 --> 00:02:32,544
even so it has become

35
00:02:32,544 --> 00:02:34,755
void and of none effect.

36
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:36,922
5 And wo to him by

37
00:02:36,922 --> 00:02:39,089
whom this offense

38
00:02:39,089 --> 00:02:41,256
cometh, for it had been

39
00:02:41,256 --> 00:02:43,423
better for him that

40
00:02:43,423 --> 00:02:45,59
he had been drowned

41
00:02:45,59 --> 00:02:47,834
in the depth of the sea.

42
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:48,334
6 But blessed are

43
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:48,834
they who have kept

44
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:49,334
the covenant and

45
00:02:49,334 --> 00:02:49,834
observed the

46
00:02:49,834 --> 00:02:50,334
commandment, for they

47
00:02:50,334 --> 00:02:50,871
shall obtain mercy.

48
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:51,671
7 Wherefore, go

49
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:52,471
to now and flee

50
00:02:52,471 --> 00:02:53,271
the land, lest

51
00:02:53,271 --> 00:02:54,071
your enemies come

52
00:02:54,071 --> 00:02:54,871
upon you; and

53
00:02:54,871 --> 00:02:55,671
take your

54
00:02:55,671 --> 00:02:56,471
journey, and appoint

55
00:02:56,471 --> 00:02:57,271
whom you will to

56
00:02:57,271 --> 00:02:58,071
be your leader,

57
00:02:58,071 --> 00:02:58,945
and to pay moneys for you.

58
00:02:58,945 --> 00:02:58,445
8 And thus you

59
00:02:58,445 --> 00:02:57,945
shall take your

60
00:02:57,945 --> 00:02:57,445
journey into

61
00:02:57,445 --> 00:02:56,945
the regions

62
00:02:56,945 --> 00:02:56,445
westward, unto the

63
00:02:56,445 --> 00:02:55,945
land of

64
00:02:55,945 --> 00:02:55,445
Missouri, unto the

65
00:02:55,445 --> 00:02:54,608
borders of the Lamanites.

66
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:54,164
9 And after

67
00:02:54,164 --> 00:02:53,72
you have done

68
00:02:53,72 --> 00:02:53,276
journeying,

69
00:02:53,276 --> 00:02:52,832
behold, I say unto

70
00:02:52,832 --> 00:02:52,388
you, seek ye

71
00:02:52,388 --> 00:02:51,944
a living like

72
00:02:51,944 --> 00:02:51,5
unto men,

73
00:02:51,5 --> 00:02:51,056
until I prepare a

74
00:02:51,056 --> 00:02:50,27
place for you.

75
00:02:50,27 --> 00:02:50,199
10 And again,

76
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:50,128
be patient

77
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:50,057
in tribulation

78
00:02:50,057 --> 00:02:49,986
until I

79
00:02:49,986 --> 00:02:49,915
come; and,

80
00:02:49,915 --> 00:02:49,844
behold, I come

81
00:02:49,844 --> 00:02:49,773
quickly, and my

82
00:02:49,773 --> 00:02:49,702
reward is with

83
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:49,631
me, and they

84
00:02:49,631 --> 00:02:49,56
who have

85
00:02:49,56 --> 00:02:49,489
sought me early

86
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:49,418
shall find

87
00:02:49,418 --> 00:02:49,347
rest to their

88
00:02:49,347 --> 00:02:49,903
souls. Even so. Amen.
