00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 54 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Prophet to Newel Knight, at Kirtland, Ohio,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
June 10, 1831. Members of the Church living in

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Thompson, Ohio, were divided on questions having to

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
do with the consecration of properties.

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Selfishness and greed were manifest. Following his mission

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
to the Shakers (see the 
heading to section 49),

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Leman Copley had broken his covenant to

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
consecrate his large farm as a place of inheritance for

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Saints arriving from Colesville, New York. As

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
a consequence, Newel Knight (leader of the

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
members living in Thompson) and other elders had come

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
to the Prophet asking how to proceed. The Prophet

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
inquired of the Lord and received this

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
revelation, which commands the members in Thompson to leave

16
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Leman Copley’s farm and journey to Missouri.

17
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
1–6, The Saints must keep the gospel covenant to

18
00:00:00,0 --> 02:08:48,
gain mercy; 
7–10, They must be patient in tribulation. 

19
02:08:48,0 --> 02:08:48,0
1 Behold, thus saith the Lord, even Alpha

20
02:08:48,0 --> 02:08:48,0
and Omega, the beginning and the end, even he

21
02:08:48,0 --> 02:15:51,
who was crucified for the sins of the world—

22
02:15:51,0 --> 02:15:51,0
2 Behold, verily, verily, I say

23
02:15:51,0 --> 02:15:51,0
unto you, my servant Newel Knight,

24
02:15:51,0 --> 02:15:51,0
you shall stand fast in the

25
02:15:51,0 --> 02:22:54,
office whereunto I have appointed you.

26
02:22:54,0 --> 02:22:54,0
3 And if your brethren

27
02:22:54,0 --> 02:22:54,0
desire to escape their enemies,

28
02:22:54,0 --> 02:22:54,0
let them repent of all

29
02:22:54,0 --> 02:22:54,0
their sins, and become truly

30
02:22:54,0 --> 02:34:32,
humble before me and contrite.

31
02:34:32,0 --> 02:34:32,0
4 And as the covenant

32
02:34:32,0 --> 02:34:32,0
which they made unto

33
02:34:32,0 --> 02:34:32,0
me has been broken,

34
02:34:32,0 --> 02:34:32,0
even so it has become

35
02:34:32,0 --> 02:49:34,
void and of none effect.

36
02:49:34,0 --> 02:49:34,0
5 And wo to him by

37
02:49:34,0 --> 02:49:34,0
whom this offense

38
02:49:34,0 --> 02:49:34,0
cometh, for it had been

39
02:49:34,0 --> 02:49:34,0
better for him that

40
02:49:34,0 --> 02:49:34,0
he had been drowned

41
02:49:34,0 --> 02:45:14,
in the depth of the sea.

42
02:45:14,0 --> 02:45:14,0
6 But blessed are

43
02:45:14,0 --> 02:45:14,0
they who have kept

44
02:45:14,0 --> 02:45:14,0
the covenant and

45
02:45:14,0 --> 02:45:14,0
observed the

46
02:45:14,0 --> 02:45:14,0
commandment, for they

47
02:45:14,0 --> 02:50:19,
shall obtain mercy.

48
02:50:19,0 --> 02:50:19,0
7 Wherefore, go

49
02:50:19,0 --> 02:50:19,0
to now and flee

50
02:50:19,0 --> 02:50:19,0
the land, lest

51
02:50:19,0 --> 02:50:19,0
your enemies come

52
02:50:19,0 --> 02:50:19,0
upon you; and

53
02:50:19,0 --> 02:50:19,0
take your

54
02:50:19,0 --> 02:50:19,0
journey, and appoint

55
02:50:19,0 --> 02:50:19,0
whom you will to

56
02:50:19,0 --> 02:50:19,0
be your leader,

57
02:50:19,0 --> 02:59:22,
and to pay moneys for you.

58
02:59:22,0 --> 02:59:22,0
8 And thus you

59
02:59:22,0 --> 02:59:22,0
shall take your

60
02:59:22,0 --> 02:59:22,0
journey into

61
02:59:22,0 --> 02:59:22,0
the regions

62
02:59:22,0 --> 02:59:22,0
westward, unto the

63
02:59:22,0 --> 02:59:22,0
land of

64
02:59:22,0 --> 02:59:22,0
Missouri, unto the

65
02:59:22,0 --> 03:11:00,
borders of the Lamanites.

66
03:11:00,0 --> 03:11:00,0
9 And after

67
03:11:00,0 --> 03:11:00,0
you have done

68
03:11:00,0 --> 03:11:00,0
journeying,

69
03:11:00,0 --> 03:11:00,0
behold, I say unto

70
03:11:00,0 --> 03:11:00,0
you, seek ye

71
03:11:00,0 --> 03:11:00,0
a living like

72
03:11:00,0 --> 03:11:00,0
unto men,

73
03:11:00,0 --> 03:11:00,0
until I prepare a

74
03:11:00,0 --> 03:21:33,
place for you.

75
03:21:33,0 --> 03:21:33,0
10 And again,

76
03:21:33,0 --> 03:21:33,0
be patient

77
03:21:33,0 --> 03:21:33,0
in tribulation

78
03:21:33,0 --> 03:21:33,0
until I

79
03:21:33,0 --> 03:21:33,0
come; and,

80
03:21:33,0 --> 03:21:33,0
behold, I come

81
03:21:33,0 --> 03:21:33,0
quickly, and my

82
03:21:33,0 --> 03:21:33,0
reward is with

83
03:21:33,0 --> 03:21:33,0
me, and they

84
03:21:33,0 --> 03:21:33,0
who have

85
03:21:33,0 --> 03:21:33,0
sought me early

86
03:21:33,0 --> 03:21:33,0
shall find

87
03:21:33,0 --> 03:21:33,0
rest to their

88
03:21:33,0 --> 03:36:35,
souls. Even so. Amen.
