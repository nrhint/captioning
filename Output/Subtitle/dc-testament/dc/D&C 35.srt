00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:38,152
Section 35 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:38,152 --> 00:00:44,022
 Prophet and Sidney Rigdon, at or near Fayette, New

3
00:00:44,022 --> 00:00:49,892
 York, December 7, 1830. At this time, the Prophet

4
00:00:49,892 --> 00:00:55,762
 was engaged almost daily in making a translation of

5
00:00:55,762 --> 00:01:01,632
 the Bible. The translation was begun as early as

6
00:01:01,632 --> 00:01:07,502
 June 1830, and both Oliver Cowdery and John

7
00:01:07,502 --> 00:01:13,372
 Whitmer had served as scribes. Since they had now been

8
00:01:13,372 --> 00:01:19,242
 called to other duties, Sidney Rigdon was called by

9
00:01:19,242 --> 00:01:25,112
 divine appointment to serve as the Prophet’s

10
00:01:25,112 --> 00:01:30,982
 scribe in this work (see 
verse 20). As a preface to

11
00:01:30,982 --> 00:01:36,852
 the record of this revelation, Joseph Smith’s

12
00:01:36,852 --> 00:01:42,722
 history states: “In December Sidney Rigdon came [from

13
00:01:42,722 --> 00:01:48,592
 Ohio] to inquire of the Lord, and with him came

14
00:01:48,592 --> 00:01:54,462
 Edward Partridge. … Shortly after the arrival of

15
00:01:54,462 --> 00:02:00,332
 these two brethren, thus spake the Lord.” 
1–2, How

16
00:02:00,332 --> 00:02:06,202
 men may become the sons of God; 
3–7, Sidney Rigdon

17
00:02:06,202 --> 00:02:12,072
 is called to baptize and to confer the Holy Ghost;

18
00:02:12,072 --> 00:02:17,942
8–12, Signs and miracles are wrought by faith;

19
00:02:17,942 --> 00:02:23,812
13–16, The Lord’s servants will thresh the nations

20
00:02:23,812 --> 00:02:29,682
 by the power of the Spirit; 
17–19, Joseph Smith

21
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:35,552
 holds the keys of the mysteries; 
20–21, The elect

22
00:02:35,552 --> 00:02:41,422
 will abide the day of the Lord’s coming; 
22–27,

23
00:02:41,422 --> 00:02:47,292
 Israel will be saved.

24
00:02:47,1 --> 00:02:53,6
1 Listen to the voice of the Lord your God, even

25
00:02:53,6 --> 00:03:00,1
 Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, whose

26
00:03:00,1 --> 00:03:06,6
 course is one eternal round, the same today as

27
00:03:06,6 --> 00:03:13,1
 yesterday, and forever

28
00:03:13,86 --> 00:03:19,693
2 I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who was

29
00:03:19,693 --> 00:03:25,526
 crucified for the sins of the world, even as many as

30
00:03:25,526 --> 00:03:31,359
 will believe on my name, that they may become the

31
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:37,192
 sons of God, even one in me as I am one in the

32
00:03:37,192 --> 00:03:43,025
 Father, as the Father is one in me, that we may be one

33
00:03:43,025 --> 00:03:48,858


34
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:53,378
3 Behold, verily, verily, I say unto my servant

35
00:03:53,378 --> 00:03:58,128
 Sidney, I have looked upon thee and thy works. I

36
00:03:58,128 --> 00:04:02,878
 have heard thy prayers, and prepared thee for a

37
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:07,628
 greater work

38
00:04:07,898 --> 00:04:13,648
4 Thou art blessed, for thou shalt do great

39
00:04:13,648 --> 00:04:19,398
 things. Behold thou wast sent forth, even as John, to

40
00:04:19,398 --> 00:04:25,148
 prepare the way before me, and before Elijah which

41
00:04:25,148 --> 00:04:30,898
 should come, and thou knewest it not

42
00:04:30,654 --> 00:04:35,154
5 Thou didst baptize by water unto repentance, but

43
00:04:35,154 --> 00:04:39,654
 they received not the Holy Ghost

44
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:44,179
6 But now I give unto thee a commandment, that

45
00:04:44,179 --> 00:04:48,679
 thou shalt baptize by water, and they shall receive

46
00:04:48,679 --> 00:04:53,179
 the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands, even

47
00:04:53,179 --> 00:04:57,679
 as the apostles of old

48
00:04:57,197 --> 00:05:02,947
7 And it shall come to pass that there shall be a

49
00:05:02,947 --> 00:05:08,697
 great work in the land, even among the Gentiles,

50
00:05:08,697 --> 00:05:14,447
 for their folly and their abominations shall be

51
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:20,197
 made manifest in the eyes of all people

52
00:05:20,937 --> 00:05:26,604
8 For I am God, and mine arm is not shortened; and

53
00:05:26,604 --> 00:05:32,271
 I will show miracles, signs, and wonders, unto

54
00:05:32,271 --> 00:05:37,938
 all those who believe on my name

55
00:05:37,27 --> 00:05:44,27
9 And whoso shall ask it in my name in faith, they

56
00:05:44,27 --> 00:05:51,27
 shall cast out devils; they shall heal the sick;

57
00:05:51,27 --> 00:05:58,27
 they shall cause the blind to receive their sight,

58
00:05:58,27 --> 00:06:05,27
 and the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak, and

59
00:06:05,27 --> 00:06:12,27
 the lame to walk

60
00:06:12,756 --> 00:06:17,756
10 And the time speedily cometh that great things

61
00:06:17,756 --> 00:06:22,756
 are to be shown forth unto the children of men

62
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:31,282
11 But without faith shall not anything be shown

63
00:06:31,282 --> 00:06:39,782
 forth except desolations upon Babylon, the same

64
00:06:39,782 --> 00:06:48,282
 which has made all nations drink of the wine of the

65
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:56,782
 wrath of her fornication

66
00:06:56,116 --> 00:07:00,783
12 And there are none that doeth good except those

67
00:07:00,783 --> 00:07:05,45
 who are ready to receive the fulness of my

68
00:07:05,45 --> 00:07:10,117
 gospel, which I have sent forth unto this generation

69
00:07:10,93 --> 00:07:19,264
13 Wherefore, I call upon the weak things of the

70
00:07:19,264 --> 00:07:27,596
 world, those who are unlearned and despised, to

71
00:07:27,596 --> 00:07:35,93
 thresh the nations by the power of my Spirit

72
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:42,622
14 And their arm shall be my arm, and I will be

73
00:07:42,622 --> 00:07:49,789
 their shield and their buckler; and I will gird up

74
00:07:49,789 --> 00:07:56,956
 their loins, and they shall fight manfully for me;

75
00:07:56,956 --> 00:08:04,123
 and their enemies shall be under their feet; and I

76
00:08:04,123 --> 00:08:11,29
 will let fall the sword in their behalf, and by

77
00:08:11,29 --> 00:08:18,457
 the fire of mine indignation will I preserve them

78
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:22,432
15 And the poor and the meek shall have the gospel

79
00:08:22,432 --> 00:08:25,932
 preached unto them, and they shall be looking

80
00:08:25,932 --> 00:08:29,432
 forth for the time of my coming, for it is nigh at

81
00:08:29,432 --> 00:08:32,932
 hand

82
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:42,929
16 And they shall learn the parable of the fig

83
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:52,929
 tree, for even now already summer is nigh

84
00:08:52,215 --> 00:08:57,215
17 And I have sent forth the fulness of my gospel

85
00:08:57,215 --> 00:09:02,215
 by the hand of my servant Joseph; and in weakness

86
00:09:02,215 --> 00:09:07,215
 have I blessed him

87
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:13,214
18 And I have given unto him the keys of the

88
00:09:13,214 --> 00:09:18,714
 mystery of those things which have been sealed, even

89
00:09:18,714 --> 00:09:24,214
 things which were from the foundation of the world,

90
00:09:24,214 --> 00:09:29,714
 and the things which shall come from this time

91
00:09:29,714 --> 00:09:35,214
 until the time of my coming, if he abide in me, and

92
00:09:35,214 --> 00:09:40,714
 if not, another will I plant in his stead

93
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:46,579
19 Wherefore, watch over him that his faith fail

94
00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:52,912
 not, and it shall be given by the Comforter, the

95
00:09:52,912 --> 00:09:59,245
 Holy Ghost, that knoweth all things

96
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:03,765
20 And a commandment I give unto thee—that thou

97
00:10:03,765 --> 00:10:08,515
 shalt write for him; and the scriptures shall be

98
00:10:08,515 --> 00:10:13,265
 given, even as they are in mine own bosom, to the

99
00:10:13,265 --> 00:10:18,015
 salvation of mine own elect

100
00:10:18,768 --> 00:10:24,518
21 For they will hear my voice, and shall see me,

101
00:10:24,518 --> 00:10:30,268
 and shall not be asleep, and shall abide the day

102
00:10:30,268 --> 00:10:36,018
 of my coming; for they shall be purified, even as I

103
00:10:36,018 --> 00:10:41,768
 am pure

104
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:47,458
22 And now I say unto you, tarry with him, and he

105
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:53,125
 shall journey with you; forsake him not, and

106
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:58,792
 surely these things shall be fulfilled

107
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:04,091
23 And inasmuch as ye do not write, behold, it

108
00:11:04,091 --> 00:11:10,091
 shall be given unto him to prophesy; and thou shalt

109
00:11:10,091 --> 00:11:16,091
 preach my gospel and call on the holy prophets to

110
00:11:16,091 --> 00:11:22,091
 prove his words, as they shall be given him

111
00:11:22,065 --> 00:11:27,815
24 Keep all the commandments and covenants by

112
00:11:27,815 --> 00:11:33,565
 which ye are bound; and I will cause the heavens to

113
00:11:33,565 --> 00:11:39,315
 shake for your good, and Satan shall tremble and

114
00:11:39,315 --> 00:11:45,065
 Zion shall rejoice upon the hills and flourish

115
00:11:45,555 --> 00:11:50,222
25 And Israel shall be saved in mine own due time;

116
00:11:50,222 --> 00:11:54,889
 and by the keys which I have given shall they be

117
00:11:54,889 --> 00:11:59,556
 led, and no more be confounded at all

118
00:11:59,102 --> 00:12:02,602
26 Lift up your hearts and be glad, your

119
00:12:02,602 --> 00:12:06,102
 redemption draweth nigh

120
00:12:06,609 --> 00:12:13,276
27 Fear not, little flock, the kingdom is yours

121
00:12:13,276 --> 00:12:19,943
 until I come. Behold, I come quickly. Even so. Amen.

122
00:12:19,943 --> 00:12:26,61
