00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 35 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Prophet and Sidney Rigdon, at or near Fayette,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
New York, December 7, 1830. At this time, the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Prophet was engaged almost daily in making a

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
translation of the Bible. The translation was begun as

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
early as June 1830, and both Oliver Cowdery and

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
John Whitmer had served as scribes. Since they

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
had now been called to other duties, Sidney

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Rigdon was called by divine appointment to serve as

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Prophet’s scribe in this work (see

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
verse 20). As a preface to the record of this

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
revelation, Joseph Smith’s history states: “In December

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Sidney Rigdon came [from Ohio] to inquire of the

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Lord, and with him came Edward Partridge. …

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Shortly after the arrival of these two brethren, thus

16
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
spake the Lord.” 
1–2, How men may become the

17
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
sons of God; 
3–7, Sidney Rigdon is called to

18
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
baptize and to confer the Holy Ghost; 
8–12, Signs

19
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and miracles are wrought by faith; 
13–16, The

20
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Lord’s servants will thresh the nations by the

21
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
power of the Spirit; 
17–19, Joseph Smith holds

22
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the keys of the mysteries; 
20–21, The elect will

23
00:00:00,0 --> 02:46:15,
abide the day of the Lord’s coming; 
22–27, Israel will be saved. 

24
02:46:15,0 --> 02:46:15,0
1 Listen to the voice of the Lord your

25
02:46:15,0 --> 02:46:15,0
God, even Alpha and Omega, the beginning and

26
02:46:15,0 --> 02:46:15,0
the end, whose course is one eternal

27
02:46:15,0 --> 02:57:52,
round, the same today as yesterday, and forever.

28
02:57:52,0 --> 02:57:52,0
2 I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who

29
02:57:52,0 --> 02:57:52,0
was crucified for the sins of the world,

30
02:57:52,0 --> 02:57:52,0
even as many as will believe on my name,

31
02:57:52,0 --> 02:57:52,0
that they may become the sons of God,

32
02:57:52,0 --> 02:57:52,0
even one in me as I am one in the Father, as

33
02:57:52,0 --> 03:00:54,
the Father is one in me, that we may be one.

34
03:00:54,0 --> 03:00:54,0
3 Behold, verily, verily, I say unto my

35
03:00:54,0 --> 03:00:54,0
servant Sidney, I have looked upon

36
03:00:54,0 --> 03:00:54,0
thee and thy works. I have heard thy

37
03:00:54,0 --> 03:11:55,
prayers, and prepared thee for a greater work.

38
03:11:55,0 --> 03:11:55,0
4 Thou art blessed, for thou shalt do

39
03:11:55,0 --> 03:11:55,0
great things. Behold thou wast sent

40
03:11:55,0 --> 03:11:55,0
forth, even as John, to prepare the

41
03:11:55,0 --> 03:11:55,0
way before me, and before Elijah which

42
03:11:55,0 --> 03:07:35,
should come, and thou knewest it not.

43
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
5 Thou didst baptize by

44
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
water unto repentance, but they

45
03:07:35,0 --> 03:11:14,
received not the Holy Ghost;

46
03:11:14,0 --> 03:11:14,0
6 But now I give unto

47
03:11:14,0 --> 03:11:14,0
thee a commandment, that

48
03:11:14,0 --> 03:11:14,0
thou shalt baptize by

49
03:11:14,0 --> 03:11:14,0
water, and they shall

50
03:11:14,0 --> 03:11:14,0
receive the Holy Ghost by the

51
03:11:14,0 --> 03:11:14,0
laying on of the hands,

52
03:11:14,0 --> 03:12:18,
even as the apostles of old.

53
03:12:18,0 --> 03:12:18,0
7 And it shall come to

54
03:12:18,0 --> 03:12:18,0
pass that there shall

55
03:12:18,0 --> 03:12:18,0
be a great work in the

56
03:12:18,0 --> 03:12:18,0
land, even among the

57
03:12:18,0 --> 03:12:18,0
Gentiles, for their folly

58
03:12:18,0 --> 03:12:18,0
and their abominations

59
03:12:18,0 --> 03:12:18,0
shall be made manifest

60
03:12:18,0 --> 03:31:18,
in the eyes of all people.

61
03:31:18,0 --> 03:31:18,0
8 For I am God, and

62
03:31:18,0 --> 03:31:18,0
mine arm is not

63
03:31:18,0 --> 03:31:18,0
shortened; and I will show

64
03:31:18,0 --> 03:31:18,0
miracles, signs, and

65
03:31:18,0 --> 03:31:18,0
wonders, unto all

66
03:31:18,0 --> 03:42:18,
those who believe on my name.

67
03:42:18,0 --> 03:42:18,0
9 And whoso shall

68
03:42:18,0 --> 03:42:18,0
ask it in my name in

69
03:42:18,0 --> 03:42:18,0
faith, they shall

70
03:42:18,0 --> 03:42:18,0
cast out devils;

71
03:42:18,0 --> 03:42:18,0
they shall heal the

72
03:42:18,0 --> 03:42:18,0
sick; they shall

73
03:42:18,0 --> 03:42:18,0
cause the blind to

74
03:42:18,0 --> 03:42:18,0
receive their sight,

75
03:42:18,0 --> 03:42:18,0
and the deaf to

76
03:42:18,0 --> 03:42:18,0
hear, and the dumb to

77
03:42:18,0 --> 03:44:22,
speak, and the lame to walk.

78
03:44:22,0 --> 03:44:22,0
10 And the time

79
03:44:22,0 --> 03:44:22,0
speedily cometh

80
03:44:22,0 --> 03:44:22,0
that great

81
03:44:22,0 --> 03:44:22,0
things are to be

82
03:44:22,0 --> 03:44:22,0
shown forth unto the

83
03:44:22,0 --> 03:48:01,
children of men;

84
03:48:01,0 --> 03:48:01,0
11 But without

85
03:48:01,0 --> 03:48:01,0
faith shall not

86
03:48:01,0 --> 03:48:01,0
anything be

87
03:48:01,0 --> 03:48:01,0
shown forth

88
03:48:01,0 --> 03:48:01,0
except desolations

89
03:48:01,0 --> 03:48:01,0
upon Babylon,

90
03:48:01,0 --> 03:48:01,0
the same which

91
03:48:01,0 --> 03:48:01,0
has made all

92
03:48:01,0 --> 03:48:01,0
nations drink of

93
03:48:01,0 --> 03:48:01,0
the wine of the

94
03:48:01,0 --> 04:07:38,
wrath of her fornication.

95
04:07:38,0 --> 04:07:38,0
12 And there

96
04:07:38,0 --> 04:07:38,0
are none that

97
04:07:38,0 --> 04:07:38,0
doeth good

98
04:07:38,0 --> 04:07:38,0
except those who

99
04:07:38,0 --> 04:07:38,0
are ready to

100
04:07:38,0 --> 04:07:38,0
receive the

101
04:07:38,0 --> 04:07:38,0
fulness of my

102
04:07:38,0 --> 04:07:38,0
gospel, which I

103
04:07:38,0 --> 04:07:38,0
have sent forth

104
04:07:38,0 --> 04:03:18,
unto this generation.

105
04:03:18,0 --> 04:03:18,0
13

106
04:03:18,0 --> 04:03:18,0
Wherefore, I call

107
04:03:18,0 --> 04:03:18,0
upon the weak

108
04:03:18,0 --> 04:03:18,0
things of the

109
04:03:18,0 --> 04:03:18,0
world,

110
04:03:18,0 --> 04:03:18,0
those who are

111
04:03:18,0 --> 04:03:18,0
unlearned and

112
04:03:18,0 --> 04:03:18,0
despised, to

113
04:03:18,0 --> 04:03:18,0
thresh the

114
04:03:18,0 --> 04:03:18,0
nations by

115
04:03:18,0 --> 04:06:57,
the power of my Spirit;

116
04:06:57,0 --> 04:06:57,0
14 And

117
04:06:57,0 --> 04:06:57,0
their arm shall

118
04:06:57,0 --> 04:06:57,0
be my arm,

119
04:06:57,0 --> 04:06:57,0
and I will

120
04:06:57,0 --> 04:06:57,0
be their

121
04:06:57,0 --> 04:06:57,0
shield and

122
04:06:57,0 --> 04:06:57,0
their

123
04:06:57,0 --> 04:06:57,0
buckler; and I

124
04:06:57,0 --> 04:06:57,0
will gird up

125
04:06:57,0 --> 04:06:57,0
their

126
04:06:57,0 --> 04:06:57,0
loins, and they

127
04:06:57,0 --> 04:06:57,0
shall fight

128
04:06:57,0 --> 04:06:57,0
manfully

129
04:06:57,0 --> 04:06:57,0
for me; and

130
04:06:57,0 --> 04:06:57,0
their

131
04:06:57,0 --> 04:06:57,0
enemies shall be

132
04:06:57,0 --> 04:06:57,0
under

133
04:06:57,0 --> 04:06:57,0
their feet; and

134
04:06:57,0 --> 04:06:57,0
I will let

135
04:06:57,0 --> 04:06:57,0
fall the

136
04:06:57,0 --> 04:06:57,0
sword in

137
04:06:57,0 --> 04:06:57,0
their behalf,

138
04:06:57,0 --> 04:06:57,0
and by the

139
04:06:57,0 --> 04:06:57,0
fire of

140
04:06:57,0 --> 04:23:59,
mine indignation will I preserve them.

141
04:23:59,0 --> 04:23:59,0
15 And the

142
04:23:59,0 --> 04:23:59,0
poor and

143
04:23:59,0 --> 04:23:59,0
the meek

144
04:23:59,0 --> 04:23:59,0
shall have

145
04:23:59,0 --> 04:23:59,0
the gospel

146
04:23:59,0 --> 04:23:59,0
preached

147
04:23:59,0 --> 04:23:59,0
unto them,

148
04:23:59,0 --> 04:23:59,0
and they

149
04:23:59,0 --> 04:23:59,0
shall be

150
04:23:59,0 --> 04:23:59,0
looking

151
04:23:59,0 --> 04:23:59,0
forth for the

152
04:23:59,0 --> 04:23:59,0
time of

153
04:23:59,0 --> 04:23:59,0
my coming,

154
04:23:59,0 --> 04:23:03,
for it is nigh at hand—

155
04:23:03,0 --> 04:23:03,0
16 And

156
04:23:03,0 --> 04:23:03,0
they shall

157
04:23:03,0 --> 04:23:03,0
learn the

158
04:23:03,0 --> 04:23:03,0
parable

159
04:23:03,0 --> 04:23:03,0
of the

160
04:23:03,0 --> 04:23:03,0
fig tree,

161
04:23:03,0 --> 04:23:03,0
for even

162
04:23:03,0 --> 04:23:03,0
now

163
04:23:03,0 --> 04:18:43,
already summer is nigh.

164
04:18:43,0 --> 04:18:43,0
17 And I

165
04:18:43,0 --> 04:18:43,0
have

166
04:18:43,0 --> 04:18:43,0
sent forth

167
04:18:43,0 --> 04:18:43,0
the

168
04:18:43,0 --> 04:18:43,0
fulness of

169
04:18:43,0 --> 04:18:43,0
my

170
04:18:43,0 --> 04:18:43,0
gospel by the

171
04:18:43,0 --> 04:18:43,0
hand of

172
04:18:43,0 --> 04:18:43,0
my

173
04:18:43,0 --> 04:18:43,0
servant

174
04:18:43,0 --> 04:18:43,0
Joseph; and

175
04:18:43,0 --> 04:18:43,0
in

176
04:18:43,0 --> 04:18:43,0
weakness have

177
04:18:43,0 --> 04:30:21,
I blessed him;

178
04:30:21,0 --> 04:30:21,0
18 And

179
04:30:21,0 --> 04:30:21,0
I have

180
04:30:21,0 --> 04:30:21,0
given

181
04:30:21,0 --> 04:30:21,0
unto him

182
04:30:21,0 --> 04:30:21,0
the

183
04:30:21,0 --> 04:30:21,0
keys of

184
04:30:21,0 --> 04:30:21,0
the

185
04:30:21,0 --> 04:30:21,0
mystery of

186
04:30:21,0 --> 04:30:21,0
those

187
04:30:21,0 --> 04:30:21,0
things

188
04:30:21,0 --> 04:30:21,0
which

189
04:30:21,0 --> 04:30:21,0
have been

190
04:30:21,0 --> 04:30:21,0


191
04:30:21,0 --> 04:30:21,0
sealed, even

192
04:30:21,0 --> 04:30:21,0
things

193
04:30:21,0 --> 04:30:21,0
which

194
04:30:21,0 --> 04:30:21,0
were

195
04:30:21,0 --> 04:30:21,0
from the

196
04:30:21,0 --> 04:30:21,0


197
04:30:21,0 --> 04:30:21,0
foundation of

198
04:30:21,0 --> 04:30:21,0
the

199
04:30:21,0 --> 04:30:21,0
world, and

200
04:30:21,0 --> 04:30:21,0
the

201
04:30:21,0 --> 04:30:21,0
things

202
04:30:21,0 --> 04:30:21,0
which

203
04:30:21,0 --> 04:30:21,0
shall come

204
04:30:21,0 --> 04:30:21,0
from

205
04:30:21,0 --> 04:30:21,0
this time

206
04:30:21,0 --> 04:30:21,0
until

207
04:30:21,0 --> 04:30:21,0
the

208
04:30:21,0 --> 04:30:21,0
time of my

209
04:30:21,0 --> 04:30:21,0


210
04:30:21,0 --> 04:30:21,0
coming, if he

211
04:30:21,0 --> 04:30:21,0
abide

212
04:30:21,0 --> 04:30:21,0
in me,

213
04:30:21,0 --> 04:30:21,0
and if

214
04:30:21,0 --> 04:37:24,
not, another will I plant in his stead.

215
04:37:24,0 --> 04:37:24,0
19

216
04:37:24,0 --> 04:37:24,0


217
04:37:24,0 --> 04:37:24,0
Wherefore,

218
04:37:24,0 --> 04:37:24,0
watch over

219
04:37:24,0 --> 04:37:24,0
him

220
04:37:24,0 --> 04:37:24,0
