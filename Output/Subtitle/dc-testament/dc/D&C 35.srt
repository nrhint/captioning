00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:07,217
Section 35 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:07,217 --> 00:00:14,434
Prophet and Sidney Rigdon, at or near Fayette,

3
00:00:14,434 --> 00:00:21,651
New York, December 7, 1830. At this time, the

4
00:00:21,651 --> 00:00:28,868
Prophet was engaged almost daily in making a

5
00:00:28,868 --> 00:00:36,085
translation of the Bible. The translation was begun as

6
00:00:36,085 --> 00:00:43,302
early as June 1830, and both Oliver Cowdery and

7
00:00:43,302 --> 00:00:50,519
John Whitmer had served as scribes. Since they

8
00:00:50,519 --> 00:00:57,736
had now been called to other duties, Sidney

9
00:00:57,736 --> 00:01:04,953
Rigdon was called by divine appointment to serve as

10
00:01:04,953 --> 00:01:12,17
the Prophet’s scribe in this work (see

11
00:01:12,17 --> 00:01:19,387
verse 20). As a preface to the record of this

12
00:01:19,387 --> 00:01:26,604
revelation, Joseph Smith’s history states: “In December

13
00:01:26,604 --> 00:01:33,821
Sidney Rigdon came [from Ohio] to inquire of the

14
00:01:33,821 --> 00:01:41,038
Lord, and with him came Edward Partridge. …

15
00:01:41,038 --> 00:01:48,255
Shortly after the arrival of these two brethren, thus

16
00:01:48,255 --> 00:01:55,472
spake the Lord.” 
1–2, How men may become the

17
00:01:55,472 --> 00:02:02,689
sons of God; 
3–7, Sidney Rigdon is called to

18
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:09,906
baptize and to confer the Holy Ghost; 
8–12, Signs

19
00:02:09,906 --> 00:02:17,123
and miracles are wrought by faith; 
13–16, The

20
00:02:17,123 --> 00:02:24,34
Lord’s servants will thresh the nations by the

21
00:02:24,34 --> 00:02:31,557
power of the Spirit; 
17–19, Joseph Smith holds

22
00:02:31,557 --> 00:02:38,774
the keys of the mysteries; 
20–21, The elect will

23
00:02:38,774 --> 00:02:46,416
abide the day of the Lord’s coming; 
22–27, Israel will be saved. 

24
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:52,666
1 Listen to the voice of the Lord your

25
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:58,916
God, even Alpha and Omega, the beginning and

26
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:05,166
the end, whose course is one eternal

27
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:11,458
round, the same today as yesterday, and forever.

28
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:10,791
2 I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who

29
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:10,124
was crucified for the sins of the world,

30
00:03:10,124 --> 00:03:09,457
even as many as will believe on my name,

31
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:08,79
that they may become the sons of God,

32
00:03:08,79 --> 00:03:08,123
even one in me as I am one in the Father, as

33
00:03:08,123 --> 00:03:07,12
the Father is one in me, that we may be one.

34
00:03:07,12 --> 00:03:08,37
3 Behold, verily, verily, I say unto my

35
00:03:08,37 --> 00:03:09,62
servant Sidney, I have looked upon

36
00:03:09,62 --> 00:03:10,87
thee and thy works. I have heard thy

37
00:03:10,87 --> 00:03:12,743
prayers, and prepared thee for a greater work.

38
00:03:12,743 --> 00:03:17,743
4 Thou art blessed, for thou shalt do

39
00:03:17,743 --> 00:03:22,743
great things. Behold thou wast sent

40
00:03:22,743 --> 00:03:27,743
forth, even as John, to prepare the

41
00:03:27,743 --> 00:03:32,743
way before me, and before Elijah which

42
00:03:32,743 --> 00:03:37,768
should come, and thou knewest it not.

43
00:03:37,768 --> 00:03:36,435
5 Thou didst baptize by

44
00:03:36,435 --> 00:03:35,102
water unto repentance, but they

45
00:03:35,102 --> 00:03:33,43
received not the Holy Ghost;

46
00:03:33,43 --> 00:03:34,001
6 But now I give unto

47
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:34,572
thee a commandment, that

48
00:03:34,572 --> 00:03:35,143
thou shalt baptize by

49
00:03:35,143 --> 00:03:35,714
water, and they shall

50
00:03:35,714 --> 00:03:36,285
receive the Holy Ghost by the

51
00:03:36,285 --> 00:03:36,856
laying on of the hands,

52
00:03:36,856 --> 00:03:37,084
even as the apostles of old.

53
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:36,459
7 And it shall come to

54
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:35,834
pass that there shall

55
00:03:35,834 --> 00:03:35,209
be a great work in the

56
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:34,584
land, even among the

57
00:03:34,584 --> 00:03:33,959
Gentiles, for their folly

58
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:33,334
and their abominations

59
00:03:33,334 --> 00:03:32,709
shall be made manifest

60
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:32,746
in the eyes of all people.

61
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:33,079
8 For I am God, and

62
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:33,412
mine arm is not

63
00:03:33,412 --> 00:03:33,745
shortened; and I will show

64
00:03:33,745 --> 00:03:34,078
miracles, signs, and

65
00:03:34,078 --> 00:03:34,411
wonders, unto all

66
00:03:34,411 --> 00:03:34,815
those who believe on my name.

67
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:35,633
9 And whoso shall

68
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:36,451
ask it in my name in

69
00:03:36,451 --> 00:03:37,269
faith, they shall

70
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:38,087
cast out devils;

71
00:03:38,087 --> 00:03:38,905
they shall heal the

72
00:03:38,905 --> 00:03:39,723
sick; they shall

73
00:03:39,723 --> 00:03:40,541
cause the blind to

74
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:41,359
receive their sight,

75
00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:42,177
and the deaf to

76
00:03:42,177 --> 00:03:42,995
hear, and the dumb to

77
00:03:42,995 --> 00:03:43,857
speak, and the lame to walk.

78
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:43,19
10 And the time

79
00:03:43,19 --> 00:03:42,523
speedily cometh

80
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:41,856
that great

81
00:03:41,856 --> 00:03:41,189
things are to be

82
00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:40,522
shown forth unto the

83
00:03:40,522 --> 00:03:39,519
children of men;

84
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:39,155
11 But without

85
00:03:39,155 --> 00:03:38,791
faith shall not

86
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:38,427
anything be

87
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:38,063
shown forth

88
00:03:38,063 --> 00:03:37,699
except desolations

89
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:37,335
upon Babylon,

90
00:03:37,335 --> 00:03:36,971
the same which

91
00:03:36,971 --> 00:03:36,607
has made all

92
00:03:36,607 --> 00:03:36,243
nations drink of

93
00:03:36,243 --> 00:03:35,879
the wine of the

94
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:35,182
wrath of her fornication.

95
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:35,282
12 And there

96
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:35,382
are none that

97
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:35,482
doeth good

98
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:35,582
except those who

99
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:35,682
are ready to

100
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:35,782
receive the

101
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:35,882
fulness of my

102
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:35,982
gospel, which I

103
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:36,082
have sent forth

104
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:36,249
unto this generation.

105
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:36,885
13

106
00:03:36,885 --> 00:03:37,521
Wherefore, I call

107
00:03:37,521 --> 00:03:38,157
upon the weak

108
00:03:38,157 --> 00:03:38,793
things of the

109
00:03:38,793 --> 00:03:39,429
world,

110
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:40,065
those who are

111
00:03:40,065 --> 00:03:40,701
unlearned and

112
00:03:40,701 --> 00:03:41,337
despised, to

113
00:03:41,337 --> 00:03:41,973
thresh the

114
00:03:41,973 --> 00:03:42,609
nations by

115
00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:43,29
the power of my Spirit;

116
00:03:43,29 --> 00:03:43,41
14 And

117
00:03:43,41 --> 00:03:43,53
their arm shall

118
00:03:43,53 --> 00:03:43,65
be my arm,

119
00:03:43,65 --> 00:03:43,77
and I will

120
00:03:43,77 --> 00:03:43,89
be their

121
00:03:43,89 --> 00:03:44,01
shield and

122
00:03:44,01 --> 00:03:44,13
their

123
00:03:44,13 --> 00:03:44,25
buckler; and I

124
00:03:44,25 --> 00:03:44,37
will gird up

125
00:03:44,37 --> 00:03:44,49
their

126
00:03:44,49 --> 00:03:44,61
loins, and they

127
00:03:44,61 --> 00:03:44,73
shall fight

128
00:03:44,73 --> 00:03:44,85
manfully

129
00:03:44,85 --> 00:03:44,97
for me; and

130
00:03:44,97 --> 00:03:45,09
their

131
00:03:45,09 --> 00:03:45,21
enemies shall be

132
00:03:45,21 --> 00:03:45,33
under

133
00:03:45,33 --> 00:03:45,45
their feet; and

134
00:03:45,45 --> 00:03:45,57
I will let

135
00:03:45,57 --> 00:03:45,69
fall the

136
00:03:45,69 --> 00:03:45,81
sword in

137
00:03:45,81 --> 00:03:45,93
their behalf,

138
00:03:45,93 --> 00:03:46,05
and by the

139
00:03:46,05 --> 00:03:46,17
fire of

140
00:03:46,17 --> 00:03:46,943
mine indignation will I preserve them.

141
00:03:46,943 --> 00:03:48,3
15 And the

142
00:03:48,3 --> 00:03:49,657
poor and

143
00:03:49,657 --> 00:03:51,014
the meek

144
00:03:51,014 --> 00:03:52,371
shall have

145
00:03:52,371 --> 00:03:53,728
the gospel

146
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,085
preached

147
00:03:55,085 --> 00:03:56,442
unto them,

148
00:03:56,442 --> 00:03:57,799
and they

149
00:03:57,799 --> 00:03:59,156
shall be

150
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:00,513
looking

151
00:04:00,513 --> 00:04:01,87
forth for the

152
00:04:01,87 --> 00:04:03,227
time of

153
00:04:03,227 --> 00:04:04,584
my coming,

154
00:04:04,584 --> 00:04:05,962
for it is nigh at hand—

155
00:04:05,962 --> 00:04:05,629
16 And

156
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:05,296
they shall

157
00:04:05,296 --> 00:04:04,963
learn the

158
00:04:04,963 --> 00:04:04,63
parable

159
00:04:04,63 --> 00:04:04,297
of the

160
00:04:04,297 --> 00:04:03,964
fig tree,

161
00:04:03,964 --> 00:04:03,631
for even

162
00:04:03,631 --> 00:04:03,298
now

163
00:04:03,298 --> 00:04:02,092
already summer is nigh.

164
00:04:02,092 --> 00:04:02,449
17 And I

165
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:02,806
have

166
00:04:02,806 --> 00:04:03,163
sent forth

167
00:04:03,163 --> 00:04:03,52
the

168
00:04:03,52 --> 00:04:03,877
fulness of

169
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:04,234
my

170
00:04:04,234 --> 00:04:04,591
gospel by the

171
00:04:04,591 --> 00:04:04,948
hand of

172
00:04:04,948 --> 00:04:05,305
my

173
00:04:05,305 --> 00:04:05,662
servant

174
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:06,019
Joseph; and

175
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:06,376
in

176
00:04:06,376 --> 00:04:06,733
weakness have

177
00:04:06,733 --> 00:04:07,18
I blessed him;

178
00:04:07,18 --> 00:04:07,45
18 And

179
00:04:07,45 --> 00:04:07,72
I have

180
00:04:07,72 --> 00:04:07,99
given

181
00:04:07,99 --> 00:04:08,26
unto him

182
00:04:08,26 --> 00:04:08,53
the

183
00:04:08,53 --> 00:04:08,8
keys of

184
00:04:08,8 --> 00:04:09,07
the

185
00:04:09,07 --> 00:04:09,34
mystery of

186
00:04:09,34 --> 00:04:09,61
those

187
00:04:09,61 --> 00:04:09,88
things

188
00:04:09,88 --> 00:04:10,15
which

189
00:04:10,15 --> 00:04:10,42
have been

190
00:04:10,42 --> 00:04:10,69


191
00:04:10,69 --> 00:04:10,96
sealed, even

192
00:04:10,96 --> 00:04:11,23
things

193
00:04:11,23 --> 00:04:11,5
which

194
00:04:11,5 --> 00:04:11,77
were

195
00:04:11,77 --> 00:04:12,04
from the

196
00:04:12,04 --> 00:04:12,31


197
00:04:12,31 --> 00:04:12,58
foundation of

198
00:04:12,58 --> 00:04:12,85
the

199
00:04:12,85 --> 00:04:13,12
world, and

200
00:04:13,12 --> 00:04:13,39
