1
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:17,365
Section 132 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:17,365 --> 00:00:23,452
 the Prophet, at Nauvoo, Illinois, recorded July

3
00:00:23,452 --> 00:00:29,539
 12, 1843, relating to the new and everlasting

4
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:35,626
 covenant, including the eternity of the marriage

5
00:00:35,626 --> 00:00:41,713
 covenant and the principle of plural marriage. Although

6
00:00:41,713 --> 00:00:47,8
 the revelation was recorded in 1843, evidence

7
00:00:47,8 --> 00:00:53,887
 indicates that some of the principles involved in this

8
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:59,974
 revelation were known by the Prophet as early as

9
00:00:59,974 --> 00:01:06,061
 1831. See 
Official Declaration 1. 
1–6, Exaltation

10
00:01:06,061 --> 00:01:12,148
 is gained through the new and everlasting

11
00:01:12,148 --> 00:01:18,235
 covenant; 
7–14, The terms and conditions of that

12
00:01:18,235 --> 00:01:24,322
 covenant are set forth; 
15–20, Celestial marriage and a

13
00:01:24,322 --> 00:01:30,409
 continuation of the family unit enable men to

14
00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:36,496
 become gods; 
21–25, The strait and narrow way leads

15
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:42,583
 to eternal lives; 
26–27, The law is given relative

16
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:48,67
 to blasphemy against the Holy Ghost; 
28–39,

17
00:01:48,67 --> 00:01:54,757
 Promises of eternal increase and exaltation are made

18
00:01:54,757 --> 00:02:00,844
 to prophets and Saints in all ages; 
40–47, Joseph

19
00:02:00,844 --> 00:02:06,931
 Smith is given the power to bind and seal on earth

20
00:02:06,931 --> 00:02:13,018
 and in heaven; 
48–50, The Lord seals upon him

21
00:02:13,018 --> 00:02:19,105
 his exaltation; 
51–57, Emma Smith is counseled to

22
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:25,192
 be faithful and true; 
58–66, Laws governing plural

23
00:02:25,192 --> 00:02:31,279
 marriage are set forth.

24
00:02:31,134 --> 00:02:34,848
1 Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you my servant

25
00:02:34,848 --> 00:02:38,562
 Joseph, that inasmuch as you have inquired of my

26
00:02:38,562 --> 00:02:42,276
 hand to know and understand wherein I, the Lord,

27
00:02:42,276 --> 00:02:45,99
 justified my servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as

28
00:02:45,99 --> 00:02:49,704
 also Moses, David and Solomon, my servants, as

29
00:02:49,704 --> 00:02:53,418
 touching the principle and doctrine of their having

30
00:02:53,418 --> 00:02:57,132
 many wives and concubines

31
00:02:57,661 --> 00:03:01,661
2 Behold, and lo, I am the Lord thy God, and will

32
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:05,661
 answer thee as touching this matter

33
00:03:05,168 --> 00:03:08,918
3 Therefore, prepare thy heart to receive and obey

34
00:03:08,918 --> 00:03:12,668
 the instructions which I am about to give unto

35
00:03:12,668 --> 00:03:16,418
 you; for all those who have this law revealed unto

36
00:03:16,418 --> 00:03:20,168
 them must obey the same

37
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:25,667
4 For behold, I reveal unto you a new and an

38
00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:31,167
 everlasting covenant; and if ye abide not that

39
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:36,667
 covenant, then are ye damned; for no one can reject this

40
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:42,167
 covenant and be permitted to enter into my glory

41
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:46,722
5 For all who will have a blessing at my hands

42
00:03:46,722 --> 00:03:50,972
 shall abide the law which was appointed for that

43
00:03:50,972 --> 00:03:55,222
 blessing, and the conditions thereof, as were

44
00:03:55,222 --> 00:03:59,472
 instituted from before the foundation of the world

45
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:05,973
6 And as pertaining to the new and everlasting

46
00:04:05,973 --> 00:04:12,373
 covenant, it was instituted for the fulness of my

47
00:04:12,373 --> 00:04:18,773
 glory; and he that receiveth a fulness thereof must

48
00:04:18,773 --> 00:04:25,173
 and shall abide the law, or he shall be damned,

49
00:04:25,173 --> 00:04:31,573
 saith the Lord God

50
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:38,09
7 And verily I say unto you, that the conditions

51
00:04:38,09 --> 00:04:44,325
 of this law are these: All covenants, contracts,

52
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:50,56
 bonds, obligations, oaths, vows, performances,

53
00:04:50,56 --> 00:04:56,795
 connections, associations, or expectations, that are

54
00:04:56,795 --> 00:05:03,03
 not made and entered into and sealed by the Holy

55
00:05:03,03 --> 00:05:09,265
 Spirit of promise, of him who is anointed, both as

56
00:05:09,265 --> 00:05:15,5
 well for time and for all eternity, and that too

57
00:05:15,5 --> 00:05:21,735
 most holy, by revelation and commandment through the

58
00:05:21,735 --> 00:05:27,97
 medium of mine anointed, whom I have appointed on

59
00:05:27,97 --> 00:05:34,205
 the earth to hold this power (and I have appointed

60
00:05:34,205 --> 00:05:40,44
 unto my servant Joseph to hold this power in the

61
00:05:40,44 --> 00:05:46,675
 last days, and there is never but one on the earth

62
00:05:46,675 --> 00:05:52,91
 at a time on whom this power and the keys of this

63
00:05:52,91 --> 00:05:59,145
 priesthood are conferred), are of no efficacy,

64
00:05:59,145 --> 00:06:05,38
 virtue, or force in and after the resurrection from

65
00:06:05,38 --> 00:06:11,615
 the dead; for all contracts that are not made unto

66
00:06:11,615 --> 00:06:17,85
 this end have an end when men are dead

67
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:22,043
8 Behold, mine house is a house of order, saith

68
00:06:22,043 --> 00:06:27,043
 the Lord God, and not a house of confusion

69
00:06:27,07 --> 00:06:33,57
9 Will I accept of an offering, saith the Lord,

70
00:06:33,57 --> 00:06:40,07
 that is not made in my name

71
00:06:40,35 --> 00:06:43,85
10 Or will I receive at your hands that which I

72
00:06:43,85 --> 00:06:47,35
 have not appointed

73
00:06:47,357 --> 00:06:54,69
11 And will I appoint unto you, saith the Lord,

74
00:06:54,69 --> 00:07:02,023
 except it be by law, even as I and my Father

75
00:07:02,023 --> 00:07:09,356
 ordained unto you, before the world was

76
00:07:09,112 --> 00:07:14,112
12 I am the Lord thy God; and I give unto you this

77
00:07:14,112 --> 00:07:19,112
 commandment—that no man shall come unto the

78
00:07:19,112 --> 00:07:24,112
 Father but by me or by my word, which is my law, saith

79
00:07:24,112 --> 00:07:29,112
 the Lord

80
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:37,487
13 And everything that is in the world, whether it

81
00:07:37,487 --> 00:07:45,058
 be ordained of men, by thrones, or

82
00:07:45,058 --> 00:07:52,629
 principalities, or powers, or things of name, whatsoever they

83
00:07:52,629 --> 00:08:00,2
 may be, that are not by me or by my word, saith the

84
00:08:00,2 --> 00:08:07,771
 Lord, shall be thrown down, and shall not remain

85
00:08:07,771 --> 00:08:15,342
 after men are dead, neither in nor after the

86
00:08:15,342 --> 00:08:22,913
 resurrection, saith the Lord your God

87
00:08:22,185 --> 00:08:26,518
14 For whatsoever things remain are by me; and

88
00:08:26,518 --> 00:08:30,851
 whatsoever things are not by me shall be shaken and

89
00:08:30,851 --> 00:08:35,184
 destroyed

90
00:08:35,699 --> 00:08:39,699
15 Therefore, if a man marry him a wife in the

91
00:08:39,699 --> 00:08:43,699
 world, and he marry her not by me nor by my word, and

92
00:08:43,699 --> 00:08:47,699
 he covenant with her so long as he is in the

93
00:08:47,699 --> 00:08:51,699
 world and she with him, their covenant and marriage

94
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:55,699
 are not of force when they are dead, and when they

95
00:08:55,699 --> 00:08:59,699
 are out of the world; therefore, they are not bound

96
00:08:59,699 --> 00:09:03,699
 by any law when they are out of the world

97
00:09:03,226 --> 00:09:08,059
16 Therefore, when they are out of the world they

98
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:12,892
 neither marry nor are given in marriage; but are

99
00:09:12,892 --> 00:09:17,725
 appointed angels in heaven, which angels are

100
00:09:17,725 --> 00:09:22,558
 ministering servants, to minister for those who are

101
00:09:22,558 --> 00:09:27,391
 worthy of a far more, and an exceeding, and an eternal

102
00:09:27,391 --> 00:09:32,224
 weight of glory

103
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:38,238
17 For these angels did not abide my law;

104
00:09:38,238 --> 00:09:44,238
 therefore, they cannot be enlarged, but remain separately

105
00:09:44,238 --> 00:09:50,238
 and singly, without exaltation, in their saved

106
00:09:50,238 --> 00:09:56,238
 condition, to all eternity; and from henceforth are

107
00:09:56,238 --> 00:10:02,238
 not gods, but are angels of God forever and ever

108
00:10:02,218 --> 00:10:07,789
18 And again, verily I say unto you, if a man

109
00:10:07,789 --> 00:10:13,36
 marry a wife, and make a covenant with her for time

110
00:10:13,36 --> 00:10:18,931
 and for all eternity, if that covenant is not by me

111
00:10:18,931 --> 00:10:24,502
 or by my word, which is my law, and is not sealed

112
00:10:24,502 --> 00:10:30,073
 by the Holy Spirit of promise, through him whom I

113
00:10:30,073 --> 00:10:35,644
 have anointed and appointed unto this power, then

114
00:10:35,644 --> 00:10:41,215
 it is not valid neither of force when they are out

115
00:10:41,215 --> 00:10:46,786
 of the world, because they are not joined by me,

116
00:10:46,786 --> 00:10:52,357
 saith the Lord, neither by my word; when they are

117
00:10:52,357 --> 00:10:57,928
 out of the world it cannot be received there,

118
00:10:57,928 --> 00:11:03,499
 because the angels and the gods are appointed there,

119
00:11:03,499 --> 00:11:09,07
 by whom they cannot pass; they cannot, therefore,

120
00:11:09,07 --> 00:11:14,641
 inherit my glory; for my house is a house of order,

121
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:20,212
 saith the Lord God

122
00:11:20,663 --> 00:11:28,663
19 And again, verily I say unto you, if a man

123
00:11:28,663 --> 00:11:36,663
 marry a wife by my word, which is my law, and by the

124
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:44,663
 new and everlasting covenant, and it is sealed unto

125
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:52,663
 them by the Holy Spirit of promise, by him who is

126
00:11:52,663 --> 00:12:00,663
 anointed, unto whom I have appointed this power

127
00:12:00,663 --> 00:12:08,663
 and the keys of this priesthood; and it shall be

128
00:12:08,663 --> 00:12:16,663
 said unto them—Ye shall come forth in the first

129
00:12:16,663 --> 00:12:24,663
 resurrection; and if it be after the first

130
00:12:24,663 --> 00:12:32,663
 resurrection, in the next resurrection; and shall inherit

131
00:12:32,663 --> 00:12:40,663
 thrones, kingdoms, principalities, and powers,

132
00:12:40,663 --> 00:12:48,663
 dominions, all heights and depths—then shall it be

133
00:12:48,663 --> 00:12:56,663
 written in the Lamb’s Book of Life, that he shall

134
00:12:56,663 --> 00:13:04,663
 commit no murder whereby to shed innocent blood, and if

135
00:13:04,663 --> 00:13:12,663
 ye abide in my covenant, and commit no murder

136
00:13:12,663 --> 00:13:20,663
 whereby to shed innocent blood, it shall be done unto

137
00:13:20,663 --> 00:13:28,663
 them in all things whatsoever my servant hath put

138
00:13:28,663 --> 00:13:36,663
 upon them, in time, and through all eternity; and

139
00:13:36,663 --> 00:13:44,663
 shall be of full force when they are out of the

140
00:13:44,663 --> 00:13:52,663
 world; and they shall pass by the angels, and the

141
00:13:52,663 --> 00:14:00,663
 gods, which are set there, to their exaltation and

142
00:14:00,663 --> 00:14:08,663
 glory in all things, as hath been sealed upon

143
00:14:08,663 --> 00:14:16,663
 their heads, which glory shall be a fulness and a

144
00:14:16,663 --> 00:14:24,663
 continuation of the seeds forever and ever

145
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:25,797
20 Then shall they be gods, because they have no

146
00:14:25,797 --> 00:14:27,13
 end; therefore shall they be from everlasting to

147
00:14:27,13 --> 00:14:28,463
 everlasting, because they continue; then shall they

148
00:14:28,463 --> 00:14:29,796
 be above all, because all things are subject unto

149
00:14:29,796 --> 00:14:31,129
 them. Then shall they be gods, because they have

150
00:14:31,129 --> 00:14:32,462
 all power, and the angels are subject unto them

151
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:32,455
21 Verily, verily, I say unto you, except ye abide

152
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:32,455
 my law ye cannot attain to this glory

153
00:14:32,855 --> 00:14:35,455
22 For strait is the gate, and narrow the way that

154
00:14:35,455 --> 00:14:38,055
 leadeth unto the exaltation and continuation of

155
00:14:38,055 --> 00:14:40,655
 the lives, and few there be that find it, because

156
00:14:40,655 --> 00:14:43,255
 ye receive me not in the world neither do ye know

157
00:14:43,255 --> 00:14:45,855
 me

158
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:50,968
23 But if ye receive me in the world, then shall

159
00:14:50,968 --> 00:14:56,301
 ye know me, and shall receive your exaltation; that

160
00:14:56,301 --> 00:15:01,634
 where I am ye shall be also

161
00:15:01,617 --> 00:15:11,617
24 This is eternal lives—to know the only wise and

162
00:15:11,617 --> 00:15:21,617
 true God, and Jesus Christ, whom he hath sent. I

163
00:15:21,617 --> 00:15:31,617
 am he. Receive ye, therefore, my law

164
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:36,881
25 Broad is the gate, and wide the way that

165
00:15:36,881 --> 00:15:42,131
 leadeth to the deaths; and many there are that go in

166
00:15:42,131 --> 00:15:47,381
 thereat, because they receive me not, neither do they

167
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:52,631
 abide in my law

168
00:15:52,168 --> 00:16:00,835
26 Verily, verily, I say unto you, if a man marry

169
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:09,502
 a wife according to my word, and they are sealed

170
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:18,169
 by the Holy Spirit of promise, according to mine

171
00:16:18,169 --> 00:16:26,836
 appointment, and he or she shall commit any sin or

172
00:16:26,836 --> 00:16:35,503
 transgression of the new and everlasting covenant

173
00:16:35,503 --> 00:16:44,17
 whatever, and all manner of blasphemies, and if

174
00:16:44,17 --> 00:16:52,837
 they commit no murder wherein they shed innocent

175
00:16:52,837 --> 00:17:01,504
 blood, yet they shall come forth in the first

176
00:17:01,504 --> 00:17:10,171
 resurrection, and enter into their exaltation; but they

177
00:17:10,171 --> 00:17:18,838
 shall be destroyed in the flesh, and shall be

178
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:27,505
 delivered unto the buffetings of Satan unto the day of

179
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:36,172
 redemption, saith the Lord God

180
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:43,088
27 The blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, which

181
00:17:43,088 --> 00:17:50,088
 shall not be forgiven in the world nor out of the

182
00:17:50,088 --> 00:17:57,088
 world, is in that ye commit murder wherein ye shed

183
00:17:57,088 --> 00:18:04,088
 innocent blood, and assent unto my death, after ye

184
00:18:04,088 --> 00:18:11,088
 have received my new and everlasting covenant,

185
00:18:11,088 --> 00:18:18,088
 saith the Lord God; and he that abideth not this law

186
00:18:18,088 --> 00:18:25,088
 can in nowise enter into my glory, but shall be

187
00:18:25,088 --> 00:18:32,088
 damned, saith the Lord

188
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:37,361
28 I am the Lord thy God, and will give unto thee

189
00:18:37,361 --> 00:18:42,694
 the law of my Holy Priesthood, as was ordained by

190
00:18:42,694 --> 00:18:48,027
 me and my Father before the world was

191
00:18:48,01 --> 00:18:48,01
29 Abraham received all things, whatsoever he

192
00:18:48,01 --> 00:18:48,01
 received, by revelation and commandment, by my word,

193
00:18:48,01 --> 00:18:48,01
 saith the Lord, and hath entered into his

194
00:18:48,01 --> 00:18:48,01
 exaltation and sitteth upon his throne

195
00:18:48,344 --> 00:18:54,455
30 Abraham received promises concerning his seed,

196
00:18:54,455 --> 00:19:00,566
 and of the fruit of his loins—from whose loins ye

197
00:19:00,566 --> 00:19:06,677
 are, namely, my servant Joseph—which were to

198
00:19:06,677 --> 00:19:12,788
 continue so long as they were in the world; and as

199
00:19:12,788 --> 00:19:18,899
 touching Abraham and his seed, out of the world they

200
00:19:18,899 --> 00:19:25,01
 should continue; both in the world and out of the

201
00:19:25,01 --> 00:19:31,121
 world should they continue as innumerable as the

202
00:19:31,121 --> 00:19:37,232
 stars; or, if ye were to count the sand upon the

203
00:19:37,232 --> 00:19:43,343
 seashore ye could not number them

204
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:51,065
31 This promise is yours also, because ye are of

205
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:58,815
 Abraham, and the promise was made unto Abraham; and

206
00:19:58,815 --> 00:20:06,565
 by this law is the continuation of the works of

207
00:20:06,565 --> 00:20:14,315
 my Father, wherein he glorifieth himself

208
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:20,313
32 Go ye, therefore, and do the works of Abraham;

209
00:20:20,313 --> 00:20:26,313
 enter ye into my law and ye shall be saved

210
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:31,975
33 But if ye enter not into my law ye cannot

211
00:20:31,975 --> 00:20:37,642
 receive the promise of my Father, which he made unto

212
00:20:37,642 --> 00:20:43,309
 Abraham

213
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:50,509
34 God commanded Abraham, and Sarah gave Hagar to

214
00:20:50,509 --> 00:20:57,909
 Abraham to wife. And why did she do it? Because

215
00:20:57,909 --> 00:21:05,309
 this was the law; and from Hagar sprang many people.

216
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:12,709
 This, therefore, was fulfilling, among other

217
00:21:12,709 --> 00:21:20,109
 things, the promises

218
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:25,412
35 Was Abraham, therefore, under condemnation?

219
00:21:25,412 --> 00:21:30,412
 Verily I say unto you, Nay; for I, the Lord,

220
00:21:30,412 --> 00:21:35,412
 commanded it

221
00:21:35,911 --> 00:21:57,911
36 Abraham was commanded to offer his son Isaac;

222
00:21:57,911 --> 00:22:19,911
 nevertheless, it was written: Thou shalt not kill.

223
00:22:19,911 --> 00:22:41,911
 Abraham, however, did not refuse, and it was

224
00:22:41,911 --> 00:23:03,911
 accounted unto him for righteousness

225
00:23:03,332 --> 00:23:03,332
37 Abraham received concubines, and they bore him

226
00:23:03,332 --> 00:23:03,332
 children; and it was accounted unto him for

227
00:23:03,332 --> 00:23:03,332
 righteousness, because they were given unto him, and he

228
00:23:03,332 --> 00:23:03,332
 abode in my law; as Isaac also and Jacob did none

229
00:23:03,332 --> 00:23:03,332
 other things than that which they were commanded;

230
00:23:03,332 --> 00:23:03,332
 and because they did none other things than that

231
00:23:03,332 --> 00:23:03,332
 which they were commanded, they have entered into

232
00:23:03,332 --> 00:23:03,332
 their exaltation, according to the promises, and

233
00:23:03,332 --> 00:23:03,332
 sit upon thrones, and are not angels but are gods

234
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:08,833
38 David also received many wives and concubines,

235
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:13,0
 and also Solomon and Moses my servants, as also

236
00:23:13,0 --> 00:23:19,167
 many others of my servants, from the beginning of

237
00:23:19,167 --> 00:23:24,334
 creation until this time; and in nothing did they

238
00:23:24,334 --> 00:23:29,501
 sin save in those things which they received not of

239
00:23:29,501 --> 00:23:34,668
 me

240
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:41,136
39 David’s wives and concubines were given unto

241
00:23:41,136 --> 00:23:47,358
 him of me, by the hand of Nathan, my servant, and

242
00:23:47,358 --> 00:23:53,58
 others of the prophets who had the keys of this

243
00:23:53,58 --> 00:23:59,802
 power; and in none of these things did he sin against

244
00:23:59,802 --> 00:24:06,024
 me save in the case of Uriah and his wife; and,

245
00:24:06,024 --> 00:24:12,246
 therefore he hath fallen from his exaltation, and

246
00:24:12,246 --> 00:24:18,468
 received his portion; and he shall not inherit them

247
00:24:18,468 --> 00:24:24,69
 out of the world, for I gave them unto another,

248
00:24:24,69 --> 00:24:30,912
 saith the Lord

249
00:24:30,853 --> 00:24:35,853
40 I am the Lord thy God, and I gave unto thee, my

250
00:24:35,853 --> 00:24:40,853
 servant Joseph, an appointment, and restore all

251
00:24:40,853 --> 00:24:45,853
 things. Ask what ye will, and it shall be given

252
00:24:45,853 --> 00:24:50,853
 unto you according to my word

253
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:54,839
41 And as ye have asked concerning adultery,

254
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:58,839
 verily, verily, I say unto you, if a man receiveth a

255
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:02,839
 wife in the new and everlasting covenant, and if she

256
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:06,839
 be with another man, and I have not appointed

257
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:10,839
 unto her by the holy anointing, she hath committed

258
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:14,839
 adultery and shall be destroyed

259
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:18,346
42 If she be not in the new and everlasting

260
00:25:18,346 --> 00:25:22,346
 covenant, and she be with another man, she has committed

261
00:25:22,346 --> 00:25:26,346
 adultery

262
00:25:26,642 --> 00:25:31,309
43 And if her husband be with another woman, and

263
00:25:31,309 --> 00:25:35,976
 he was under a vow, he hath broken his vow and hath

264
00:25:35,976 --> 00:25:40,643
 committed adultery

265
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:45,796
44 And if she hath not committed adultery, but is

266
00:25:45,796 --> 00:25:50,653
 innocent and hath not broken her vow, and she

267
00:25:50,653 --> 00:25:55,51
 knoweth it, and I reveal it unto you, my servant

268
00:25:55,51 --> 00:26:00,367
 Joseph, then shall you have power, by the power of my

269
00:26:00,367 --> 00:26:05,224
 Holy Priesthood, to take her and give her unto him

270
00:26:05,224 --> 00:26:10,081
 that hath not committed adultery but hath been

271
00:26:10,081 --> 00:26:14,938
 faithful; for he shall be made ruler over many

272
00:26:14,44 --> 00:26:19,773
45 For I have conferred upon you the keys and

273
00:26:19,773 --> 00:26:25,106
 power of the priesthood, wherein I restore all things,

274
00:26:25,106 --> 00:26:30,439
 and make known unto you all things in due time

275
00:26:30,189 --> 00:26:35,064
46 And verily, verily, I say unto you, that

276
00:26:35,064 --> 00:26:39,939
 whatsoever you seal on earth shall be sealed in heaven;

277
00:26:39,939 --> 00:26:44,814
 and whatsoever you bind on earth, in my name and

278
00:26:44,814 --> 00:26:49,689
 by my word, saith the Lord, it shall be eternally

279
00:26:49,689 --> 00:26:54,564
 bound in the heavens; and whosesoever sins you

280
00:26:54,564 --> 00:26:59,439
 remit on earth shall be remitted eternally in the

281
00:26:59,439 --> 00:27:04,314
 heavens; and whosesoever sins you retain on earth

282
00:27:04,314 --> 00:27:09,189
 shall be retained in heaven

283
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:16,128
47 And again, verily I say, whomsoever you bless I

284
00:27:16,128 --> 00:27:23,128
 will bless, and whomsoever you curse I will

285
00:27:23,128 --> 00:27:30,128
 curse, saith the Lord; for I, the Lord, am thy God

286
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:35,113
48 And again, verily I say unto you, my servant

287
00:27:35,113 --> 00:27:39,827
 Joseph, that whatsoever you give on earth, and to

288
00:27:39,827 --> 00:27:44,541
 whomsoever you give any one on earth, by my word and

289
00:27:44,541 --> 00:27:49,255
 according to my law, it shall be visited with

290
00:27:49,255 --> 00:27:53,969
 blessings and not cursings, and with my power, saith

291
00:27:53,969 --> 00:27:58,683
 the Lord, and shall be without condemnation on

292
00:27:58,683 --> 00:28:03,397
 earth and in heaven

293
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:09,432
49 For I am the Lord thy God, and will be with

294
00:28:09,432 --> 00:28:15,432
 thee even unto the end of the world, and through all

295
00:28:15,432 --> 00:28:21,432
 eternity; for verily I seal upon you your

296
00:28:21,432 --> 00:28:27,432
 exaltation, and prepare a throne for you in the kingdom of

297
00:28:27,432 --> 00:28:33,432
 my Father, with Abraham your father

298
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:40,778
50 Behold, I have seen your sacrifices, and will

299
00:28:40,778 --> 00:28:48,378
 forgive all your sins; I have seen your sacrifices

300
00:28:48,378 --> 00:28:55,978
 in obedience to that which I have told you. Go,

301
00:28:55,978 --> 00:29:03,578
 therefore, and I make a way for your escape, as I

302
00:29:03,578 --> 00:29:11,178
 accepted the offering of Abraham of his son Isaac

303
00:29:11,433 --> 00:29:17,862
51 Verily, I say unto you: A commandment I give

304
00:29:17,862 --> 00:29:24,291
 unto mine handmaid, Emma Smith, your wife, whom I

305
00:29:24,291 --> 00:29:30,72
 have given unto you, that she stay herself and

306
00:29:30,72 --> 00:29:37,149
 partake not of that which I commanded you to offer unto

307
00:29:37,149 --> 00:29:43,578
 her; for I did it, saith the Lord, to prove you

308
00:29:43,578 --> 00:29:50,007
 all, as I did Abraham, and that I might require an

309
00:29:50,007 --> 00:29:56,436
 offering at your hand, by covenant and sacrifice

310
00:29:56,178 --> 00:30:04,378
52 And let mine handmaid, Emma Smith, receive all

311
00:30:04,378 --> 00:30:12,578
 those that have been given unto my servant Joseph,

312
00:30:12,578 --> 00:30:20,778
 and who are virtuous and pure before me; and

313
00:30:20,778 --> 00:30:28,978
 those who are not pure, and have said they were pure,

314
00:30:28,978 --> 00:30:37,178
 shall be destroyed, saith the Lord God

315
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:42,569
53 For I am the Lord thy God, and ye shall obey my

316
00:30:42,569 --> 00:30:47,969
 voice; and I give unto my servant Joseph that he

317
00:30:47,969 --> 00:30:53,369
 shall be made ruler over many things; for he hath

318
00:30:53,369 --> 00:30:58,769
 been faithful over a few things, and from

319
00:30:58,769 --> 00:31:04,169
 henceforth I will strengthen him

320
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:10,096
54 And I command mine handmaid, Emma Smith, to

321
00:31:10,096 --> 00:31:15,763
 abide and cleave unto my servant Joseph, and to none

322
00:31:15,763 --> 00:31:21,43
 else. But if she will not abide this commandment

323
00:31:21,43 --> 00:31:27,097
 she shall be destroyed, saith the Lord; for I am

324
00:31:27,097 --> 00:31:32,764
 the Lord thy God, and will destroy her if she abide

325
00:31:32,764 --> 00:31:38,431
 not in my law

326
00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:47,554
55 But if she will not abide this commandment,

327
00:31:47,554 --> 00:31:56,411
 then shall my servant Joseph do all things for her,

328
00:31:56,411 --> 00:32:05,268
 even as he hath said; and I will bless him and

329
00:32:05,268 --> 00:32:14,125
 multiply him and give unto him an hundred-fold in this

330
00:32:14,125 --> 00:32:22,982
 world, of fathers and mothers, brothers and

331
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:31,839
 sisters, houses and lands, wives and children, and

332
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:40,696
 crowns of eternal lives in the eternal worlds

333
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:45,425
56 And again, verily I say, let mine handmaid

334
00:32:45,425 --> 00:32:50,425
 forgive my servant Joseph his trespasses; and then

335
00:32:50,425 --> 00:32:55,425
 shall she be forgiven her trespasses, wherein she has

336
00:32:55,425 --> 00:33:00,425
 trespassed against me; and I, the Lord thy God,

337
00:33:00,425 --> 00:33:05,425
 will bless her, and multiply her, and make her

338
00:33:05,425 --> 00:33:10,425
 heart to rejoice

339
00:33:10,172 --> 00:33:15,458
57 And again, I say, let not my servant Joseph put

340
00:33:15,458 --> 00:33:20,744
 his property out of his hands, lest an enemy come

341
00:33:20,744 --> 00:33:26,03
 and destroy him; for Satan seeketh to destroy;

342
00:33:26,03 --> 00:33:31,316
 for I am the Lord thy God, and he is my servant; and

343
00:33:31,316 --> 00:33:36,602
 behold, and lo, I am with him, as I was with

344
00:33:36,602 --> 00:33:41,888
 Abraham, thy father, even unto his exaltation and

345
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:47,174
 glory

346
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:51,159
58 Now, as touching the law of the priesthood,

347
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:54,659
 there are many things pertaining thereunto

348
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:59,523
59 Verily, if a man be called of my Father, as was

349
00:33:59,523 --> 00:34:04,38
 Aaron, by mine own voice, and by the voice of him

350
00:34:04,38 --> 00:34:09,237
 that sent me, and I have endowed him with the

351
00:34:09,237 --> 00:34:14,094
 keys of the power of this priesthood, if he do

352
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:18,951
 anything in my name, and according to my law and by my

353
00:34:18,951 --> 00:34:23,808
 word, he will not commit sin, and I will justify

354
00:34:23,808 --> 00:34:28,665
 him

355
00:34:28,216 --> 00:34:33,716
60 Let no one, therefore, set on my servant

356
00:34:33,716 --> 00:34:39,216
 Joseph; for I will justify him; for he shall do the

357
00:34:39,216 --> 00:34:44,716
 sacrifice which I require at his hands for his

358
00:34:44,716 --> 00:34:50,216
 transgressions, saith the Lord your God

359
00:34:50,205 --> 00:34:55,455
61 And again, as pertaining to the law of the

360
00:34:55,455 --> 00:35:00,705
 priesthood—if any man espouse a virgin, and desire to

361
00:35:00,705 --> 00:35:05,955
 espouse another, and the first give her consent,

362
00:35:05,955 --> 00:35:11,205
 and if he espouse the second, and they are virgins,

363
00:35:11,205 --> 00:35:16,455
 and have vowed to no other man, then is he

364
00:35:16,455 --> 00:35:21,705
 justified; he cannot commit adultery for they are given

365
00:35:21,705 --> 00:35:26,955
 unto him; for he cannot commit adultery with that

366
00:35:26,955 --> 00:35:32,205
 that belongeth unto him and to no one else

367
00:35:32,197 --> 00:35:36,447
62 And if he have ten virgins given unto him by

368
00:35:36,447 --> 00:35:40,697
 this law, he cannot commit adultery, for they belong

369
00:35:40,697 --> 00:35:44,947
 to him, and they are given unto him; therefore is

370
00:35:44,947 --> 00:35:49,197
 he justified

371
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:51,547
63 But if one or either of the ten virgins, after

372
00:35:51,547 --> 00:35:53,847
 she is espoused, shall be with another man, she

373
00:35:53,847 --> 00:35:56,147
 has committed adultery, and shall be destroyed; for

374
00:35:56,147 --> 00:35:58,447
 they are given unto him to multiply and replenish

375
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:00,747
 the earth, according to my commandment, and to

376
00:36:00,747 --> 00:36:03,047
 fulfil the promise which was given by my Father

377
00:36:03,047 --> 00:36:05,347
 before the foundation of the world, and for their

378
00:36:05,347 --> 00:36:07,647
 exaltation in the eternal worlds, that they may bear

379
00:36:07,647 --> 00:36:09,947
 the souls of men; for herein is the work of my

380
00:36:09,947 --> 00:36:12,247
 Father continued, that he may be glorified

381
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:19,378
64 And again, verily, verily, I say unto you, if

382
00:36:19,378 --> 00:36:26,753
 any man have a wife, who holds the keys of this

383
00:36:26,753 --> 00:36:34,128
 power, and he teaches unto her the law of my

384
00:36:34,128 --> 00:36:41,503
 priesthood, as pertaining to these things, then shall she

385
00:36:41,503 --> 00:36:48,878
 believe and administer unto him, or she shall be

386
00:36:48,878 --> 00:36:56,253
 destroyed, saith the Lord your God; for I will

387
00:36:56,253 --> 00:37:03,628
 destroy her; for I will magnify my name upon all those

388
00:37:03,628 --> 00:37:11,003
 who receive and abide in my law

389
00:37:11,513 --> 00:37:16,735
65 Therefore, it shall be lawful in me, if she

390
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:21,957
 receive not this law, for him to receive all things

391
00:37:21,957 --> 00:37:27,179
 whatsoever I, the Lord his God, will give unto him,

392
00:37:27,179 --> 00:37:32,401
 because she did not believe and administer unto

393
00:37:32,401 --> 00:37:37,623
 him according to my word; and she then becomes the

394
00:37:37,623 --> 00:37:42,845
 transgressor; and he is exempt from the law of

395
00:37:42,845 --> 00:37:48,067
 Sarah, who administered unto Abraham according to the

396
00:37:48,067 --> 00:37:53,289
 law when I commanded Abraham to take Hagar to

397
00:37:53,289 --> 00:37:58,511
 wife

398
00:37:58,243 --> 00:38:02,243
66 And now, as pertaining to this law, verily,

399
00:38:02,243 --> 00:38:06,243
 verily, I say unto you, I will reveal more unto you,

400
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:10,243
 hereafter; therefore, let this suffice for the

401
00:38:10,243 --> 00:38:14,243
 present. Behold, I am Alpha and Omega. Amen.
