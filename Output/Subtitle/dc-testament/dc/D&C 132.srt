00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 132 Revelation given through Joseph

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Smith the Prophet, at Nauvoo, Illinois, recorded

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
July 12, 1843, relating to the new and everlasting

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
covenant, including the eternity of the marriage

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
covenant and the principle of plural marriage.

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Although the revelation was recorded in 1843,

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
evidence indicates that some of the principles

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
involved in this revelation were known by the

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Prophet as early as 1831. See 
Official Declaration

given the power to bind and seal on earth and in

02:30:45,0 --> 02:30:45,0
1 Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you my

25
02:30:45,0 --> 02:30:45,0
servant Joseph, that inasmuch as you have inquired

26
02:30:45,0 --> 02:30:45,0
of my hand to know and understand wherein I,

27
02:30:45,0 --> 02:30:45,0
the Lord, justified my servants Abraham,

28
02:30:45,0 --> 02:30:45,0
Isaac, and Jacob, as also Moses, David and Solomon,

29
02:30:45,0 --> 02:30:45,0
my servants, as touching the principle and

30
02:30:45,0 --> 02:56:46,
doctrine of their having many wives and concubines—

31
02:56:46,0 --> 02:56:46,0
2 Behold, and lo, I am the Lord thy God,

32
02:56:46,0 --> 03:03:49,
and will answer thee as touching this matter.

33
03:03:49,0 --> 03:03:49,0
3 Therefore, prepare thy heart to

34
03:03:49,0 --> 03:03:49,0
receive and obey the instructions

35
03:03:49,0 --> 03:03:49,0
which I am about to give unto you;

36
03:03:49,0 --> 03:03:49,0
for all those who have this law

37
03:03:49,0 --> 03:06:51,
revealed unto them must obey the same.

38
03:06:51,0 --> 03:06:51,0
4 For behold, I reveal unto you a

39
03:06:51,0 --> 03:06:51,0
new and an everlasting covenant;

40
03:06:51,0 --> 03:06:51,0
and if ye abide not that

41
03:06:51,0 --> 03:06:51,0
covenant, then are ye damned; for no one

42
03:06:51,0 --> 03:06:51,0
can reject this covenant and be

43
03:06:51,0 --> 03:19:27,
permitted to enter into my glory.

44
03:19:27,0 --> 03:19:27,0
5 For all who will have a

45
03:19:27,0 --> 03:19:27,0
blessing at my hands shall abide the

46
03:19:27,0 --> 03:19:27,0
law which was appointed for that

47
03:19:27,0 --> 03:19:27,0
blessing, and the conditions

48
03:19:27,0 --> 03:19:27,0
thereof, as were instituted from

49
03:19:27,0 --> 03:32:31,
before the foundation of the world.

50
03:32:31,0 --> 03:32:31,0
6 And as pertaining to the new

51
03:32:31,0 --> 03:32:31,0
and everlasting covenant, it

52
03:32:31,0 --> 03:32:31,0
was instituted for the fulness

53
03:32:31,0 --> 03:32:31,0
of my glory; and he that

54
03:32:31,0 --> 03:32:31,0
receiveth a fulness thereof must

55
03:32:31,0 --> 03:32:31,0
and shall abide the law, or he

56
03:32:31,0 --> 03:41:34,
shall be damned, saith the Lord God.

57
03:41:34,0 --> 03:41:34,0
7 And verily I say unto you,

58
03:41:34,0 --> 03:41:34,0
that the conditions of this law

59
03:41:34,0 --> 03:41:34,0
are these: All covenants,

60
03:41:34,0 --> 03:41:34,0
contracts, bonds, obligations,

61
03:41:34,0 --> 03:41:34,0
oaths, vows, performances,

62
03:41:34,0 --> 03:41:34,0
connections, associations, or

63
03:41:34,0 --> 03:41:34,0
expectations, that are not made and

64
03:41:34,0 --> 03:41:34,0
entered into and sealed by

65
03:41:34,0 --> 03:41:34,0
the Holy Spirit of promise, of

66
03:41:34,0 --> 03:41:34,0
him who is anointed, both as

67
03:41:34,0 --> 03:41:34,0
well for time and for all

68
03:41:34,0 --> 03:41:34,0
eternity, and that too most holy, by

69
03:41:34,0 --> 03:41:34,0
revelation and commandment

70
03:41:34,0 --> 03:41:34,0
through the medium of mine

71
03:41:34,0 --> 03:41:34,0
anointed, whom I have appointed on

72
03:41:34,0 --> 03:41:34,0
the earth to hold this power

73
03:41:34,0 --> 03:41:34,0
(and I have appointed unto my

74
03:41:34,0 --> 03:41:34,0
servant Joseph to hold this

75
03:41:34,0 --> 03:41:34,0
power in the last days, and there

76
03:41:34,0 --> 03:41:34,0
is never but one on the earth

77
03:41:34,0 --> 03:41:34,0
at a time on whom this power

78
03:41:34,0 --> 03:41:34,0
and the keys of this

79
03:41:34,0 --> 03:41:34,0
priesthood are conferred), are of no

80
03:41:34,0 --> 03:41:34,0
efficacy, virtue, or force in

81
03:41:34,0 --> 03:41:34,0
and after the resurrection from

82
03:41:34,0 --> 03:41:34,0
the dead; for all contracts

83
03:41:34,0 --> 03:41:34,0
that are not made unto this end

84
03:41:34,0 --> 03:58:35,
have an end when men are dead.

85
03:58:35,0 --> 03:58:35,0
8 Behold, mine house

86
03:58:35,0 --> 03:58:35,0
is a house of order,

87
03:58:35,0 --> 03:58:35,0
saith the Lord God, and

88
03:58:35,0 --> 04:27:37,
not a house of confusion.

89
04:27:37,0 --> 04:27:37,0
9 Will I accept of

90
04:27:37,0 --> 04:27:37,0
an offering, saith

91
04:27:37,0 --> 04:27:37,0
the Lord, that is

92
04:27:37,0 --> 04:31:16,
not made in my name?

93
04:31:16,0 --> 04:31:16,0
10 Or will I

94
04:31:16,0 --> 04:31:16,0
receive at your

95
04:31:16,0 --> 04:31:16,0
hands that which I

96
04:31:16,0 --> 05:46:08,
have not appointed?

97
05:46:08,0 --> 05:46:08,0
11 And will I

98
05:46:08,0 --> 05:46:08,0
appoint unto

99
05:46:08,0 --> 05:46:08,0
you, saith the

100
05:46:08,0 --> 05:46:08,0
Lord, except

101
05:46:08,0 --> 05:46:08,0
it be by law,

102
05:46:08,0 --> 05:46:08,0
even as I and

103
05:46:08,0 --> 05:46:08,0
my Father

104
05:46:08,0 --> 05:46:08,0
ordained unto you,

105
05:46:08,0 --> 06:15:10,
before the world was?

106
06:15:10,0 --> 06:15:10,0
12 I am the

107
06:15:10,0 --> 06:15:10,0
Lord thy God;

108
06:15:10,0 --> 06:15:10,0
and I give

109
06:15:10,0 --> 06:15:10,0
unto you this

110
06:15:10,0 --> 06:15:10,0


111
06:15:10,0 --> 06:15:10,0
commandment—that no man

112
06:15:10,0 --> 06:15:10,0
shall come unto

113
06:15:10,0 --> 06:15:10,0
the Father

114
06:15:10,0 --> 06:15:10,0
but by me or by

115
06:15:10,0 --> 06:15:10,0
my word,

116
06:15:10,0 --> 06:15:10,0
which is my law,

117
06:15:10,0 --> 06:26:48,
saith the Lord.

118
06:26:48,0 --> 06:26:48,0
13 And

119
06:26:48,0 --> 06:26:48,0
everything that

120
06:26:48,0 --> 06:26:48,0
is in the

121
06:26:48,0 --> 06:26:48,0
world, whether

122
06:26:48,0 --> 06:26:48,0
it be

123
06:26:48,0 --> 06:26:48,0
ordained of men,

124
06:26:48,0 --> 06:26:48,0
by thrones,

125
06:26:48,0 --> 06:26:48,0
or

126
06:26:48,0 --> 06:26:48,0
principalities, or

127
06:26:48,0 --> 06:26:48,0
powers, or

128
06:26:48,0 --> 06:26:48,0
things of name,

129
06:26:48,0 --> 06:26:48,0
whatsoever

130
06:26:48,0 --> 06:26:48,0
they may be,

131
06:26:48,0 --> 06:26:48,0
that are not

132
06:26:48,0 --> 06:26:48,0
by me or by

133
06:26:48,0 --> 06:26:48,0
my word,

134
06:26:48,0 --> 06:26:48,0
saith the

135
06:26:48,0 --> 06:26:48,0
Lord, shall be

136
06:26:48,0 --> 06:26:48,0
thrown down,

137
06:26:48,0 --> 06:26:48,0
and shall

138
06:26:48,0 --> 06:26:48,0
not remain

139
06:26:48,0 --> 06:26:48,0
after men are

140
06:26:48,0 --> 06:26:48,0
dead, neither

141
06:26:48,0 --> 06:26:48,0
in nor

142
06:26:48,0 --> 06:26:48,0
after the

143
06:26:48,0 --> 06:38:54,
resurrection, saith the Lord your God.

144
06:38:54,0 --> 06:38:54,0
14 For

145
06:38:54,0 --> 06:38:54,0
whatsoever

146
06:38:54,0 --> 06:38:54,0
things

147
06:38:54,0 --> 06:38:54,0
remain are by

148
06:38:54,0 --> 06:38:54,0
me; and

149
06:38:54,0 --> 06:38:54,0
whatsoever

150
06:38:54,0 --> 06:38:54,0
things are

151
06:38:54,0 --> 06:38:54,0
not by me

152
06:38:54,0 --> 06:38:54,0
shall be

153
06:38:54,0 --> 06:43:59,
shaken and destroyed.

154
06:43:59,0 --> 06:43:59,0
15

155
06:43:59,0 --> 06:43:59,0
Therefore, if a

156
06:43:59,0 --> 06:43:59,0
man

157
06:43:59,0 --> 06:43:59,0
marry him a

158
06:43:59,0 --> 06:43:59,0
wife in

159
06:43:59,0 --> 06:43:59,0
the world,

160
06:43:59,0 --> 06:43:59,0
and he

161
06:43:59,0 --> 06:43:59,0
marry her

162
06:43:59,0 --> 06:43:59,0
not by me

163
06:43:59,0 --> 06:43:59,0
nor by my

164
06:43:59,0 --> 06:43:59,0
word,

165
06:43:59,0 --> 06:43:59,0
and he

166
06:43:59,0 --> 06:43:59,0
covenant with

167
06:43:59,0 --> 06:43:59,0
her so

168
06:43:59,0 --> 06:43:59,0
long as he

169
06:43:59,0 --> 06:43:59,0
is in

170
06:43:59,0 --> 06:43:59,0
the world

171
06:43:59,0 --> 06:43:59,0
and she

172
06:43:59,0 --> 06:43:59,0
with him,

173
06:43:59,0 --> 06:43:59,0
their

174
06:43:59,0 --> 06:43:59,0
covenant and

175
06:43:59,0 --> 06:43:59,0
marriage

176
06:43:59,0 --> 06:43:59,0
are not

177
06:43:59,0 --> 06:43:59,0
of force

178
06:43:59,0 --> 06:43:59,0
when they

179
06:43:59,0 --> 06:43:59,0
are dead,

180
06:43:59,0 --> 06:43:59,0
and when

181
06:43:59,0 --> 06:43:59,0
they are

182
06:43:59,0 --> 06:43:59,0
out of

183
06:43:59,0 --> 06:43:59,0
the world;

184
06:43:59,0 --> 06:43:59,0


185
06:43:59,0 --> 06:43:59,0
therefore, they

186
06:43:59,0 --> 06:43:59,0
are not

187
06:43:59,0 --> 06:43:59,0
bound by

188
06:43:59,0 --> 06:46:03,
any law when they are out of the world.

189
06:46:03,0 --> 06:46:03,0
16

190
06:46:03,0 --> 06:46:03,0
Therefore,

191
06:46:03,0 --> 06:46:03,0
when they

192
06:46:03,0 --> 06:46:03,0
are out

193
06:46:03,0 --> 06:46:03,0
of the

194
06:46:03,0 --> 06:46:03,0
world

195
06:46:03,0 --> 06:46:03,0
they

196
06:46:03,0 --> 06:46:03,0
neither marry

197
06:46:03,0 --> 06:46:03,0
nor are

198
06:46:03,0 --> 06:46:03,0
given in

199
06:46:03,0 --> 06:46:03,0


200
06:46:03,0 --> 06:46:03,0
marriage; but

201
06:46:03,0 --> 06:46:03,0
are

202
06:46:03,0 --> 06:46:03,0
appointed

203
06:46:03,0 --> 06:46:03,0
angels in

204
06:46:03,0 --> 06:46:03,0
heaven,

205
06:46:03,0 --> 06:46:03,0
which

206
06:46:03,0 --> 06:46:03,0
angels are

207
06:46:03,0 --> 06:46:03,0


208
06:46:03,0 --> 06:46:03,0
ministering

209
06:46:03,0 --> 06:46:03,0
servants, to

210
06:46:03,0 --> 06:46:03,0


211
06:46:03,0 --> 06:46:03,0
minister for

212
06:46:03,0 --> 06:46:03,0
those who

213
06:46:03,0 --> 06:46:03,0
are

214
06:46:03,0 --> 06:46:03,0
worthy of a

215
06:46:03,0 --> 06:46:03,0
far

216
06:46:03,0 --> 06:46:03,0
more, and an

217
06:46:03,0 --> 06:46:03,0


218
06:46:03,0 --> 07:08:06,
exceeding, and an eternal weight of glory.

219
07:08:06,0 --> 07:08:06,0
17 For

220
07:08:06,0 --> 07:08:06,0
these

221
07:08:06,0 --> 07:08:06,0
angels did

222
07:08:06,0 --> 07:08:06,0
not

223
07:08:06,0 --> 07:08:06,0
abide my

224
07:08:06,0 --> 07:08:06,0
law;

225
07:08:06,0 --> 07:08:06,0
therefore,

226
07:08:06,0 --> 07:08:06,0
they cannot

227
07:08:06,0 --> 07:08:06,0
be

228
07:08:06,0 --> 07:08:06,0
enlarged,

229
07:08:06,0 --> 07:08:06,0
but remain

230
07:08:06,0 --> 07:08:06,0


231
07:08:06,0 --> 07:08:06,0
separately and

232
07:08:06,0 --> 07:08:06,0
singly,

233
07:08:06,0 --> 07:08:06,0
without

234
07:08:06,0 --> 07:08:06,0


235
07:08:06,0 --> 07:08:06,0
exaltation, in

236
07:08:06,0 --> 07:08:06,0
their

237
07:08:06,0 --> 07:08:06,0
saved

238
07:08:06,0 --> 07:08:06,0
condition, to

239
07:08:06,0 --> 07:08:06,0
all

240
07:08:06,0 --> 07:08:06,0
eternity;

241
07:08:06,0 --> 07:08:06,0
and from

242
07:08:06,0 --> 07:08:06,0


243
07:08:06,0 --> 07:08:06,0
henceforth are

244
07:08:06,0 --> 07:08:06,0
not gods,

245
07:08:06,0 --> 07:08:06,0
but are

246
07:08:06,0 --> 07:08:06,0
angels

247
07:08:06,0 --> 07:08:06,0
of God

248
07:08:06,0 --> 07:08:06,0
forever

249
07:08:06,0 --> 07:20:41,
and ever.

250
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
18 And

251
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
again,

252
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
verily

253
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
I say

254
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
unto

255
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
you, if a

256
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
man

257
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
marry a

258
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
wife, and

259
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
make a

260
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0


261
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
covenant with

262
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
her

263
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
for time

264
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
and for

265
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
all

266
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
eternity,

267
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
if

268
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
that

269
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
covenant is

270
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
not by

271
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
me or

272
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
by my

273
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
word,

274
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
which is

275
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
my law,

276
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
and is

277
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
not

278
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
sealed by

279
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
the

280
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
Holy

281
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
Spirit of

282
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
promise,

283
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
through

284
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
him

285
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
whom I

286
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
have

287
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
anointed

288
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
and

289
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
appointed

290
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
unto this

291
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
power,

292
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
then

293
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
it is

294
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
not valid

295
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0


296
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
neither of

297
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0

298
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
when they

299
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
are out

300
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
of the

301
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
world,

302
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0


303
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
because they

304
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
are not

305
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
joined

306
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
by me,

307
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
saith

308
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
the

309
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
Lord,

310
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
neither by

311
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
my

312
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
word; when

313
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
they

314
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
are out

315
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
of the

316
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
world it

317
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
cannot

318
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
be

319
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
received

320
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
there,

321
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
because

322
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
the

323
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
angels and

324
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
the

325
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
gods are

326
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0


327
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
appointed

328
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
there, by

329
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
whom

330
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
they

331
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
cannot pass;

332
07:20:41,0 --> 07:20:41,0
they

333
07:20:41,0 --> 07:27:44,
cannot, therefore, inherit my glory; for my house is a house of order, saith the Lord God.

334
07:27:44,0 --> 07:27:44,0
19 And

335
07:27:44,0 --> 07:27:44,0


336
07:27:44,0 --> 07:27:44,0
again,

337
07:27:44,0 --> 07:27:44,0
verily I

338
07:27:44,0 --> 07:27:44,0
say

339
07:27:44,0 --> 07:27:44,0
unto you,

340
07:27:44,0 --> 07:27:44,0
if a

341
07:27:44,0 --> 07:27:44,0

342
07:27:44,0 --> 07:27:44,0
marry a

07:27:44,0 --> 07:27:44,0

346
07:27:44,0 --> 07:27:44,0
which

347
07:27:44,0 --> 07:27:44,0
is my

348
07:27:44,0 --> 07:27:44,0
law,

349
07:27:44,0 --> 07:27:44,0
and by

350
07:27:44,0 --> 07:27:44,0
the new

07:27:44,0 --> 07:27:44,0
covenant, and

356
07:27:44,0 --> 07:27:44,0
it is

07:27:44,0 --> 07:27:44,0


358
07:27:44,0 --> 07:27:44,0
sealed unto

359
07:27:44,0 --> 07:27:44,0
