00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 123 Duty of the Saints in relation to

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
their persecutors, as written by Joseph Smith

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Prophet while a prisoner in the jail at

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Liberty, Missouri. This section is an excerpt

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
from an epistle to the Church dated March 20,

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
1839 (see the 
heading to section 121). 
1–6,

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
The Saints should collect and publish an account

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of their sufferings and persecutions; 
7–10,

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
The same spirit that established the false

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
creeds also leads to persecution of the Saints;

11
00:00:00,0 --> 01:24:27,
11–17, Many among all sects will yet receive the truth. 

12
01:24:27,0 --> 01:24:27,0
1 And again, we would suggest for your

13
01:24:27,0 --> 01:24:27,0
consideration the propriety of all the

14
01:24:27,0 --> 01:24:27,0
saints gathering up a knowledge of all

15
01:24:27,0 --> 01:24:27,0
the facts, and sufferings and abuses

16
01:24:27,0 --> 01:55:27,
put upon them by the people of this State;

17
01:55:27,0 --> 01:55:27,0
2 And also of all the property and

18
01:55:27,0 --> 01:55:27,0
amount of damages which they have

19
01:55:27,0 --> 01:55:27,0
sustained, both of character and

20
01:55:27,0 --> 02:18:28,
personal injuries, as well as real property;

21
02:18:28,0 --> 02:18:28,0
3 And also the names of all

22
02:18:28,0 --> 02:18:28,0
persons that have had a hand in their

23
02:18:28,0 --> 02:18:28,0
oppressions, as far as they can

24
02:18:28,0 --> 02:37:28,
get hold of them and find them out.

25
02:37:28,0 --> 02:37:28,0
4 And perhaps a committee

26
02:37:28,0 --> 02:37:28,0
can be appointed to find out

27
02:37:28,0 --> 02:37:28,0
these things, and to take

28
02:37:28,0 --> 02:37:28,0
statements and affidavits; and

29
02:37:28,0 --> 02:37:28,0
also to gather up the

30
02:37:28,0 --> 03:04:26,
libelous publications that are afloat;

31
03:04:26,0 --> 03:04:26,0
5 And all that are in the

32
03:04:26,0 --> 03:04:26,0
magazines, and in the

33
03:04:26,0 --> 03:04:26,0
encyclopedias, and all the

34
03:04:26,0 --> 03:04:26,0
libelous histories that are

35
03:04:26,0 --> 03:04:26,0
published, and are writing,

36
03:04:26,0 --> 03:04:26,0
and by whom, and present

37
03:04:26,0 --> 03:04:26,0
the whole concatenation of

38
03:04:26,0 --> 03:04:26,0
diabolical rascality and

39
03:04:26,0 --> 03:04:26,0
nefarious and murderous

40
03:04:26,0 --> 03:04:26,0
impositions that have been

41
03:04:26,0 --> 03:11:29,
practiced upon this people—

42
03:11:29,0 --> 03:11:29,0
6 That we may not only

43
03:11:29,0 --> 03:11:29,0
publish to all the world,

44
03:11:29,0 --> 03:11:29,0
but present them to the

45
03:11:29,0 --> 03:11:29,0
heads of government in all

46
03:11:29,0 --> 03:11:29,0
their dark and hellish

47
03:11:29,0 --> 03:11:29,0
hue, as the last effort

48
03:11:29,0 --> 03:11:29,0
which is enjoined on us by

49
03:11:29,0 --> 03:11:29,0
our Heavenly Father,

50
03:11:29,0 --> 03:11:29,0
before we can fully and

51
03:11:29,0 --> 03:11:29,0
completely claim that promise

52
03:11:29,0 --> 03:11:29,0
which shall call him forth

53
03:11:29,0 --> 03:11:29,0
from his hiding place;

54
03:11:29,0 --> 03:11:29,0
and also that the whole

55
03:11:29,0 --> 03:11:29,0
nation may be left without

56
03:11:29,0 --> 03:11:29,0
excuse before he can send

57
03:11:29,0 --> 03:13:33,
forth the power of his mighty arm.

58
03:13:33,0 --> 03:13:33,0
7 It is an imperative

59
03:13:33,0 --> 03:13:33,0
duty that we owe to God,

60
03:13:33,0 --> 03:13:33,0
to angels, with whom we

61
03:13:33,0 --> 03:13:33,0
shall be brought to

62
03:13:33,0 --> 03:13:33,0
stand, and also to ourselves,

63
03:13:33,0 --> 03:13:33,0
to our wives and

64
03:13:33,0 --> 03:13:33,0
children, who have been made

65
03:13:33,0 --> 03:13:33,0
to bow down with grief,

66
03:13:33,0 --> 03:13:33,0
sorrow, and care, under

67
03:13:33,0 --> 03:13:33,0
the most damning hand of

68
03:13:33,0 --> 03:13:33,0
murder, tyranny, and

69
03:13:33,0 --> 03:13:33,0
oppression, supported and

70
03:13:33,0 --> 03:13:33,0
urged on and upheld by

71
03:13:33,0 --> 03:13:33,0
the influence of that

72
03:13:33,0 --> 03:13:33,0
spirit which hath so

73
03:13:33,0 --> 03:13:33,0
strongly riveted the creeds of

74
03:13:33,0 --> 03:13:33,0
the fathers, who have

75
03:13:33,0 --> 03:13:33,0
inherited lies, upon the

76
03:13:33,0 --> 03:13:33,0
hearts of the children,

77
03:13:33,0 --> 03:13:33,0
and filled the world with

78
03:13:33,0 --> 03:13:33,0
confusion, and has been

79
03:13:33,0 --> 03:13:33,0
growing stronger and

80
03:13:33,0 --> 03:13:33,0
stronger, and is now the

81
03:13:33,0 --> 03:13:33,0
very mainspring of all

82
03:13:33,0 --> 03:13:33,0
corruption, and the whole

83
03:13:33,0 --> 03:17:12,
earth groans under the weight of its iniquity.

84
03:17:12,0 --> 03:17:12,0
8 It is an iron yoke,

85
03:17:12,0 --> 03:17:12,0
it is a strong band;

86
03:17:12,0 --> 03:17:12,0
they are the very

87
03:17:12,0 --> 03:17:12,0
handcuffs, and chains, and

88
03:17:12,0 --> 04:00:08,
shackles, and fetters of hell.

89
04:00:08,0 --> 04:00:08,0
9 Therefore it is an

90
04:00:08,0 --> 04:00:08,0
imperative duty that

91
04:00:08,0 --> 04:00:08,0
we owe, not only to

92
04:00:08,0 --> 04:00:08,0
our own wives and

93
04:00:08,0 --> 04:00:08,0
children, but to the

94
04:00:08,0 --> 04:00:08,0
widows and fatherless,

95
04:00:08,0 --> 04:00:08,0
whose husbands and

96
04:00:08,0 --> 04:00:08,0
fathers have been

97
04:00:08,0 --> 04:11:46,
murdered under its iron hand;

98
04:11:46,0 --> 04:11:46,0
10 Which dark and

99
04:11:46,0 --> 04:11:46,0
blackening deeds are

100
04:11:46,0 --> 04:11:46,0
enough to make

101
04:11:46,0 --> 04:11:46,0
hell itself shudder,

102
04:11:46,0 --> 04:11:46,0
and to stand aghast

103
04:11:46,0 --> 04:11:46,0
and pale, and the

104
04:11:46,0 --> 04:11:46,0
hands of the very

105
04:11:46,0 --> 04:46:44,
devil to tremble and palsy.

106
04:46:44,0 --> 04:46:44,0
11 And also it is

107
04:46:44,0 --> 04:46:44,0
an imperative duty

108
04:46:44,0 --> 04:46:44,0
that we owe to

109
04:46:44,0 --> 04:46:44,0
all the rising

110
04:46:44,0 --> 04:46:44,0
generation, and to all

111
04:46:44,0 --> 05:32:44,
the pure in heart—

112
05:32:44,0 --> 05:32:44,0
12 For there are

113
05:32:44,0 --> 05:32:44,0
many yet on the

114
05:32:44,0 --> 05:32:44,0
earth among all

115
05:32:44,0 --> 05:32:44,0
sects, parties, and

116
05:32:44,0 --> 05:32:44,0
denominations,

117
05:32:44,0 --> 05:32:44,0
who are blinded by

118
05:32:44,0 --> 05:32:44,0
the subtle

119
05:32:44,0 --> 05:32:44,0
craftiness of men,

120
05:32:44,0 --> 05:32:44,0
whereby they lie in

121
05:32:44,0 --> 05:32:44,0
wait to deceive,

122
05:32:44,0 --> 05:32:44,0
and who are only

123
05:32:44,0 --> 05:32:44,0
kept from the

124
05:32:44,0 --> 05:32:44,0
truth because they

125
05:32:44,0 --> 06:15:40,
know not where to find it—

126
06:15:40,0 --> 06:15:40,0
13 Therefore,

127
06:15:40,0 --> 06:15:40,0
that we should

128
06:15:40,0 --> 06:15:40,0
waste and wear out

129
06:15:40,0 --> 06:15:40,0
our lives in

130
06:15:40,0 --> 06:15:40,0
bringing to light

131
06:15:40,0 --> 06:15:40,0
all the hidden

132
06:15:40,0 --> 06:15:40,0
things of

133
06:15:40,0 --> 06:15:40,0
darkness, wherein we

134
06:15:40,0 --> 06:15:40,0
know them; and they

135
06:15:40,0 --> 06:15:40,0
are truly

136
06:15:40,0 --> 07:10:37,
manifest from heaven—

137
07:10:37,0 --> 07:10:37,0
14 These

138
07:10:37,0 --> 07:10:37,0
should then be

139
07:10:37,0 --> 07:10:37,0
attended to with

140
07:10:37,0 --> 07:11:41,
great earnestness.

141
07:11:41,0 --> 07:11:41,0
15 Let no man

142
07:11:41,0 --> 07:11:41,0
count them

143
07:11:41,0 --> 07:11:41,0
as small

144
07:11:41,0 --> 07:11:41,0
things; for there

145
07:11:41,0 --> 07:11:41,0
is much which

146
07:11:41,0 --> 07:11:41,0
lieth in

147
07:11:41,0 --> 07:11:41,0
futurity,

148
07:11:41,0 --> 07:11:41,0
pertaining to the

149
07:11:41,0 --> 07:11:41,0
saints, which

150
07:11:41,0 --> 07:11:41,0
depends upon

151
07:11:41,0 --> 07:31:46,
these things.

152
07:31:46,0 --> 07:31:46,0
16 You know,

153
07:31:46,0 --> 07:31:46,0
brethren,

154
07:31:46,0 --> 07:31:46,0
that a very

155
07:31:46,0 --> 07:31:46,0
large ship is

156
07:31:46,0 --> 07:31:46,0
benefited

157
07:31:46,0 --> 07:31:46,0
very much by

158
07:31:46,0 --> 07:31:46,0
a very small

159
07:31:46,0 --> 07:31:46,0
helm in the

160
07:31:46,0 --> 07:31:46,0
time of a

161
07:31:46,0 --> 07:31:46,0
storm, by

162
07:31:46,0 --> 07:31:46,0
being kept

163
07:31:46,0 --> 07:31:46,0
workways with

164
07:31:46,0 --> 08:06:44,
the wind and the waves.

165
08:06:44,0 --> 08:06:44,0
17

166
08:06:44,0 --> 08:06:44,0
Therefore, dearly

167
08:06:44,0 --> 08:06:44,0
beloved

168
08:06:44,0 --> 08:06:44,0
brethren, let

169
08:06:44,0 --> 08:06:44,0
us

170
08:06:44,0 --> 08:06:44,0
cheerfully do all

171
08:06:44,0 --> 08:06:44,0
things that

172
08:06:44,0 --> 08:06:44,0
lie in our

173
08:06:44,0 --> 08:06:44,0
power; and

174
08:06:44,0 --> 08:06:44,0
then may we

175
08:06:44,0 --> 08:06:44,0
stand

176
08:06:44,0 --> 08:06:44,0
still, with the

177
08:06:44,0 --> 08:06:44,0
utmost

178
08:06:44,0 --> 08:06:44,0
assurance, to

179
08:06:44,0 --> 08:06:44,0
see the

180
08:06:44,0 --> 08:06:44,0
salvation of

181
08:06:44,0 --> 08:06:44,0
God, and for

182
08:06:44,0 --> 08:34:48,
his arm to be revealed.
