00:00:41,225 --> 00:00:45,134
Section 123 Duty of the Saints in relation to

2
00:00:45,134 --> 00:00:49,043
 their persecutors, as written by Joseph Smith the

3
00:00:49,043 --> 00:00:52,952
 Prophet while a prisoner in the jail at Liberty,

4
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:56,861
 Missouri. This section is an excerpt from an epistle to

5
00:00:56,861 --> 00:01:00,77
 the Church dated March 20, 1839 (see the 
heading

6
00:01:00,77 --> 00:01:04,679
 to section 121). 
1–6, The Saints should collect

7
00:01:04,679 --> 00:01:08,588
 and publish an account of their sufferings and

8
00:01:08,588 --> 00:01:12,497
 persecutions; 
7–10, The same spirit that established

9
00:01:12,497 --> 00:01:16,406
 the false creeds also leads to persecution of the

10
00:01:16,406 --> 00:01:20,315
 Saints; 
11–17, Many among all sects will yet

11
00:01:20,315 --> 00:01:24,224
 receive the truth.

12
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:32,985
1 And again, we would suggest for your

13
00:01:32,985 --> 00:01:40,985
 consideration the propriety of all the saints gathering up a

14
00:01:40,985 --> 00:01:48,985
 knowledge of all the facts, and sufferings and

15
00:01:48,985 --> 00:01:56,985
 abuses put upon them by the people of this State

16
00:01:56,033 --> 00:02:03,7
2 And also of all the property and amount of

17
00:02:03,7 --> 00:02:11,367
 damages which they have sustained, both of character

18
00:02:11,367 --> 00:02:19,034
 and personal injuries, as well as real property

19
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:26,106
3 And also the names of all persons that have had

20
00:02:26,106 --> 00:02:32,439
 a hand in their oppressions, as far as they can

21
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:38,772
 get hold of them and find them out

22
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:47,841
4 And perhaps a committee can be appointed to find

23
00:02:47,841 --> 00:02:57,591
 out these things, and to take statements and

24
00:02:57,591 --> 00:03:07,341
 affidavits; and also to gather up the libelous

25
00:03:07,341 --> 00:03:17,091
 publications that are afloat

26
00:03:17,814 --> 00:03:26,981
5 And all that are in the magazines, and in the

27
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:36,148
 encyclopedias, and all the libelous histories that

28
00:03:36,148 --> 00:03:45,315
 are published, and are writing, and by whom, and

29
00:03:45,315 --> 00:03:54,482
 present the whole concatenation of diabolical

30
00:03:54,482 --> 00:04:03,649
 rascality and nefarious and murderous impositions that

31
00:04:03,649 --> 00:04:12,816
 have been practiced upon this people

32
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:21,285
6 That we may not only publish to all the world,

33
00:04:21,285 --> 00:04:30,285
 but present them to the heads of government in all

34
00:04:30,285 --> 00:04:39,285
 their dark and hellish hue, as the last effort

35
00:04:39,285 --> 00:04:48,285
 which is enjoined on us by our Heavenly Father,

36
00:04:48,285 --> 00:04:57,285
 before we can fully and completely claim that promise

37
00:04:57,285 --> 00:05:06,285
 which shall call him forth from his hiding place;

38
00:05:06,285 --> 00:05:15,285
 and also that the whole nation may be left without

39
00:05:15,285 --> 00:05:24,285
 excuse before he can send forth the power of his

40
00:05:24,285 --> 00:05:33,285
 mighty arm

41
00:05:33,75 --> 00:05:41,442
7 It is an imperative duty that we owe to God, to

42
00:05:41,442 --> 00:05:49,134
 angels, with whom we shall be brought to stand,

43
00:05:49,134 --> 00:05:56,826
 and also to ourselves, to our wives and children,

44
00:05:56,826 --> 00:06:04,518
 who have been made to bow down with grief, sorrow,

45
00:06:04,518 --> 00:06:12,21
 and care, under the most damning hand of murder,

46
00:06:12,21 --> 00:06:19,902
 tyranny, and oppression, supported and urged on and

47
00:06:19,902 --> 00:06:27,594
 upheld by the influence of that spirit which hath

48
00:06:27,594 --> 00:06:35,286
 so strongly riveted the creeds of the fathers, who

49
00:06:35,286 --> 00:06:42,978
 have inherited lies, upon the hearts of the

50
00:06:42,978 --> 00:06:50,67
 children, and filled the world with confusion, and has

51
00:06:50,67 --> 00:06:58,362
 been growing stronger and stronger, and is now the

52
00:06:58,362 --> 00:07:06,054
 very mainspring of all corruption, and the whole

53
00:07:06,054 --> 00:07:13,746
 earth groans under the weight of its iniquity

54
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:24,499
8 It is an iron yoke, it is a strong band; they

55
00:07:24,499 --> 00:07:35,832
 are the very handcuffs, and chains, and shackles,

56
00:07:35,832 --> 00:07:47,165
 and fetters of hell

57
00:07:47,484 --> 00:07:52,484
9 Therefore it is an imperative duty that we owe,

58
00:07:52,484 --> 00:07:57,484
 not only to our own wives and children, but to the

59
00:07:57,484 --> 00:08:02,484
 widows and fatherless, whose husbands and fathers

60
00:08:02,484 --> 00:08:07,484
 have been murdered under its iron hand

61
00:08:07,771 --> 00:08:14,771
10 Which dark and blackening deeds are enough to

62
00:08:14,771 --> 00:08:21,771
 make hell itself shudder, and to stand aghast and

63
00:08:21,771 --> 00:08:28,771
 pale, and the hands of the very devil to tremble

64
00:08:28,771 --> 00:08:35,771
 and palsy

65
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:40,765
11 And also it is an imperative duty that we owe

66
00:08:40,765 --> 00:08:45,765
 to all the rising generation, and to all the pure

67
00:08:45,765 --> 00:08:50,765
 in heart

68
00:08:50,53 --> 00:08:58,93
12 For there are many yet on the earth among all

69
00:08:58,93 --> 00:09:07,33
 sects, parties, and denominations, who are blinded

70
00:09:07,33 --> 00:09:15,73
 by the subtle craftiness of men, whereby they lie

71
00:09:15,73 --> 00:09:24,13
 in wait to deceive, and who are only kept from the

72
00:09:24,13 --> 00:09:32,53
 truth because they know not where to find it

73
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:39,288
13 Therefore, that we should waste and wear out

74
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:46,538
 our lives in bringing to light all the hidden things

75
00:09:46,538 --> 00:09:53,788
 of darkness, wherein we know them; and they are

76
00:09:53,788 --> 00:10:01,038
 truly manifest from heaven

77
00:10:01,551 --> 00:10:04,551
14 These should then be attended to with great

78
00:10:04,551 --> 00:10:07,551
 earnestness

79
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:14,174
15 Let no man count them as small things; for

80
00:10:14,174 --> 00:10:20,507
 there is much which lieth in futurity, pertaining to

81
00:10:20,507 --> 00:10:26,84
 the saints, which depends upon these things

82
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:33,609
16 You know, brethren, that a very large ship is

83
00:10:33,609 --> 00:10:40,859
 benefited very much by a very small helm in the

84
00:10:40,859 --> 00:10:48,109
 time of a storm, by being kept workways with the wind

85
00:10:48,109 --> 00:10:55,359
 and the waves

86
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:59,988
17 Therefore, dearly beloved brethren, let us

87
00:10:59,988 --> 00:11:04,588
 cheerfully do all things that lie in our power; and

88
00:11:04,588 --> 00:11:09,188
 then may we stand still, with the utmost assurance,

89
00:11:09,188 --> 00:11:13,788
 to see the salvation of God, and for his arm to be

90
00:11:13,788 --> 00:11:18,388
 revealed.
