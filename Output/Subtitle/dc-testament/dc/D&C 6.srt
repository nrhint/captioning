00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 6 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Prophet and Oliver Cowdery, at Harmony,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Pennsylvania, April 1829. Oliver Cowdery began his labors as

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
scribe in the translation of the Book of Mormon,

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
April 7, 1829. He had already received a divine

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
manifestation of the truth of the Prophet’s

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
testimony respecting the plates on which was engraved

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Book of Mormon record. The Prophet inquired

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of the Lord through the Urim and Thummim and

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
received this response. 
1–6, Laborers in the Lord’s

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
field gain salvation; 
7–13, There is no gift

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
greater than the gift of salvation; 
14–27, A witness

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of the truth comes by the power of the Spirit;

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:56:58,
28–37, Look unto Christ, and do good continually. 

15
00:56:58,0 --> 00:56:58,0
1 A great and marvelous work is about

16
00:56:58,0 --> 01:03:09,
to come forth unto the children of men.

17
01:03:09,0 --> 01:03:09,0
2 Behold, I am God; give heed unto my

18
01:03:09,0 --> 01:03:09,0
word, which is quick and powerful,

19
01:03:09,0 --> 01:03:09,0
sharper than a two-edged sword, to the

20
01:03:09,0 --> 01:03:09,0
dividing asunder of both joints and

21
01:03:09,0 --> 01:10:53,
marrow; therefore give heed unto my words.

22
01:10:53,0 --> 01:10:53,0
3 Behold, the field is white

23
01:10:53,0 --> 01:10:53,0
already to harvest; therefore, whoso

24
01:10:53,0 --> 01:10:53,0
desireth to reap, let him thrust in

25
01:10:53,0 --> 01:10:53,0
his sickle with his might, and

26
01:10:53,0 --> 01:10:53,0
reap while the day lasts, that he may

27
01:10:53,0 --> 01:10:53,0
treasure up for his soul

28
01:10:53,0 --> 01:17:04,
everlasting salvation in the kingdom of God.

29
01:17:04,0 --> 01:17:04,0
4 Yea, whosoever will

30
01:17:04,0 --> 01:17:04,0
thrust in his sickle and reap,

31
01:17:04,0 --> 01:34:12,
the same is called of God.

32
01:34:12,0 --> 01:34:12,0
5 Therefore, if you will

33
01:34:12,0 --> 01:34:12,0
ask of me you shall

34
01:34:12,0 --> 01:34:12,0
receive; if you will knock it

35
01:34:12,0 --> 01:39:23,
shall be opened unto you.

36
01:39:23,0 --> 01:39:23,0
6 Now, as you have

37
01:39:23,0 --> 01:39:23,0
asked, behold, I say

38
01:39:23,0 --> 01:39:23,0
unto you, keep my

39
01:39:23,0 --> 01:39:23,0
commandments, and seek to

40
01:39:23,0 --> 01:39:23,0
bring forth and

41
01:39:23,0 --> 01:41:35,
establish the cause of Zion;

42
01:41:35,0 --> 01:41:35,0
7 Seek not for

43
01:41:35,0 --> 01:41:35,0
riches but for wisdom,

44
01:41:35,0 --> 01:41:35,0
and behold, the

45
01:41:35,0 --> 01:41:35,0
mysteries of God shall

46
01:41:35,0 --> 01:41:35,0
be unfolded unto

47
01:41:35,0 --> 01:41:35,0
you, and then shall

48
01:41:35,0 --> 01:41:35,0
you be made rich.

49
01:41:35,0 --> 01:41:35,0
Behold, he that hath

50
01:41:35,0 --> 01:42:47,
eternal life is rich.

51
01:42:47,0 --> 01:42:47,0
8 Verily, verily,

52
01:42:47,0 --> 01:42:47,0
I say unto you,

53
01:42:47,0 --> 01:42:47,0
even as you desire

54
01:42:47,0 --> 01:42:47,0
of me so it shall

55
01:42:47,0 --> 01:42:47,0
be unto you; and if

56
01:42:47,0 --> 01:42:47,0
you desire, you

57
01:42:47,0 --> 01:42:47,0
shall be the means

58
01:42:47,0 --> 01:42:47,0
of doing much good

59
01:42:47,0 --> 01:43:45,
in this generation.

60
01:43:45,0 --> 01:43:45,0
9 Say nothing

61
01:43:45,0 --> 01:43:45,0
but repentance

62
01:43:45,0 --> 01:43:45,0
unto this

63
01:43:45,0 --> 01:43:45,0
generation; keep my

64
01:43:45,0 --> 01:43:45,0
commandments, and

65
01:43:45,0 --> 01:43:45,0
assist to bring

66
01:43:45,0 --> 01:43:45,0
forth my work,

67
01:43:45,0 --> 01:43:45,0
according to my

68
01:43:45,0 --> 01:43:45,0
commandments, and

69
01:43:45,0 --> 01:52:55,
you shall be blessed.

70
01:52:55,0 --> 01:52:55,0
10 Behold thou

71
01:52:55,0 --> 01:52:55,0
hast a gift,

72
01:52:55,0 --> 01:52:55,0
and blessed

73
01:52:55,0 --> 01:52:55,0
art thou because

74
01:52:55,0 --> 01:52:55,0
of thy gift.

75
01:52:55,0 --> 01:52:55,0
Remember it is

76
01:52:55,0 --> 01:52:55,0
sacred and

77
01:52:55,0 --> 02:08:23,
cometh from above—

78
02:08:23,0 --> 02:08:23,0
11 And if

79
02:08:23,0 --> 02:08:23,0
thou wilt

80
02:08:23,0 --> 02:08:23,0
inquire, thou shalt

81
02:08:23,0 --> 02:08:23,0
know

82
02:08:23,0 --> 02:08:23,0
mysteries which are

83
02:08:23,0 --> 02:08:23,0
great and

84
02:08:23,0 --> 02:08:23,0
marvelous;

85
02:08:23,0 --> 02:08:23,0
therefore thou

86
02:08:23,0 --> 02:08:23,0
shalt exercise

87
02:08:23,0 --> 02:08:23,0
thy gift, that

88
02:08:23,0 --> 02:08:23,0
thou mayest

89
02:08:23,0 --> 02:08:23,0
find out

90
02:08:23,0 --> 02:08:23,0
mysteries, that

91
02:08:23,0 --> 02:08:23,0
thou mayest

92
02:08:23,0 --> 02:08:23,0
bring many to

93
02:08:23,0 --> 02:08:23,0
the knowledge

94
02:08:23,0 --> 02:08:23,0
of the truth,

95
02:08:23,0 --> 02:08:23,0
yea,

96
02:08:23,0 --> 02:08:23,0
convince them of the

97
02:08:23,0 --> 02:16:35,
error of their ways.

98
02:16:35,0 --> 02:16:35,0
12 Make not

99
02:16:35,0 --> 02:16:35,0
thy gift

100
02:16:35,0 --> 02:16:35,0
known unto

101
02:16:35,0 --> 02:16:35,0
any save it

102
02:16:35,0 --> 02:16:35,0
be those

103
02:16:35,0 --> 02:16:35,0
who are of

104
02:16:35,0 --> 02:16:35,0
thy faith.

105
02:16:35,0 --> 02:16:35,0
Trifle not

106
02:16:35,0 --> 02:28:18,
with sacred things.

107
02:28:18,0 --> 02:28:18,0
13 If thou

108
02:28:18,0 --> 02:28:18,0
wilt do

109
02:28:18,0 --> 02:28:18,0
good, yea,

110
02:28:18,0 --> 02:28:18,0
and hold

111
02:28:18,0 --> 02:28:18,0
out

112
02:28:18,0 --> 02:28:18,0
faithful to the

113
02:28:18,0 --> 02:28:18,0
end, thou

114
02:28:18,0 --> 02:28:18,0
shalt be

115
02:28:18,0 --> 02:28:18,0
saved in the

116
02:28:18,0 --> 02:28:18,0
kingdom

117
02:28:18,0 --> 02:28:18,0
of God,

118
02:28:18,0 --> 02:28:18,0
which is the

119
02:28:18,0 --> 02:28:18,0
greatest

120
02:28:18,0 --> 02:28:18,0
of all the

121
02:28:18,0 --> 02:28:18,0
gifts of

122
02:28:18,0 --> 02:28:18,0
God; for

123
02:28:18,0 --> 02:28:18,0
there is no

124
02:28:18,0 --> 02:28:18,0
gift

125
02:28:18,0 --> 02:28:18,0
greater than

126
02:28:18,0 --> 02:35:13,
the gift of salvation.

127
02:35:13,0 --> 02:35:13,0
14

128
02:35:13,0 --> 02:35:13,0
Verily, verily,

129
02:35:13,0 --> 02:35:13,0
I say

130
02:35:13,0 --> 02:35:13,0
unto thee,

131
02:35:13,0 --> 02:35:13,0
blessed

132
02:35:13,0 --> 02:35:13,0
art thou

133
02:35:13,0 --> 02:35:13,0
for what

134
02:35:13,0 --> 02:35:13,0
thou hast

135
02:35:13,0 --> 02:35:13,0
done; for

136
02:35:13,0 --> 02:35:13,0
thou

137
02:35:13,0 --> 02:35:13,0
hast

138
02:35:13,0 --> 02:35:13,0
inquired of me,

139
02:35:13,0 --> 02:35:13,0
and

140
02:35:13,0 --> 02:35:13,0
behold, as

141
02:35:13,0 --> 02:35:13,0
often as

142
02:35:13,0 --> 02:35:13,0
thou hast

143
02:35:13,0 --> 02:35:13,0
inquired

144
02:35:13,0 --> 02:35:13,0
thou hast

145
02:35:13,0 --> 02:35:13,0
received

146
02:35:13,0 --> 02:35:13,0


147
02:35:13,0 --> 02:35:13,0
instruction of my

148
02:35:13,0 --> 02:35:13,0
Spirit. If

149
02:35:13,0 --> 02:35:13,0
it had

150
02:35:13,0 --> 02:35:13,0
not been

151
02:35:13,0 --> 02:35:13,0
so, thou

152
02:35:13,0 --> 02:35:13,0
wouldst

153
02:35:13,0 --> 02:35:13,0
not have

154
02:35:13,0 --> 02:35:13,0
come to the

155
02:35:13,0 --> 02:37:25,
place where thou art at this time.

156
02:37:25,0 --> 02:37:25,0
15

157
02:37:25,0 --> 02:37:25,0
Behold, thou

158
02:37:25,0 --> 02:37:25,0
knowest

159
02:37:25,0 --> 02:37:25,0
that

160
02:37:25,0 --> 02:37:25,0
thou hast

161
02:37:25,0 --> 02:37:25,0
inquired

162
02:37:25,0 --> 02:37:25,0
of me

163
02:37:25,0 --> 02:37:25,0
and I did

164
02:37:25,0 --> 02:37:25,0


165
02:37:25,0 --> 02:37:25,0
enlighten thy

166
02:37:25,0 --> 02:37:25,0
mind; and

167
02:37:25,0 --> 02:37:25,0
now I

168
02:37:25,0 --> 02:37:25,0
tell thee

169
02:37:25,0 --> 02:37:25,0
these

170
02:37:25,0 --> 02:37:25,0
things

171
02:37:25,0 --> 02:37:25,0
that thou

172
02:37:25,0 --> 02:37:25,0
mayest

173
02:37:25,0 --> 02:37:25,0
know that

174
02:37:25,0 --> 02:37:25,0
thou

175
02:37:25,0 --> 02:37:25,0
hast been

176
02:37:25,0 --> 02:37:25,0


177
02:37:25,0 --> 02:52:04,
enlightened by the Spirit of truth;

178
02:52:04,0 --> 02:52:04,0
16 Yea,

179
02:52:04,0 --> 02:52:04,0
I tell

180
02:52:04,0 --> 02:52:04,0
thee,

181
02:52:04,0 --> 02:52:04,0
that

182
02:52:04,0 --> 02:52:04,0

183
02:52:04,0 --> 02:52:04,0
mayest know

184
02:52:04,0 --> 02:52:04,0

185
02:52:04,0 --> 02:52:04,0
there is

186
02:52:04,0 --> 02:52:04,0

188
02:52:04,0 --> 02:52:04,0
save God

189
02:52:04,0 --> 02:52:04,0
that

190
02:52:04,0 --> 02:52:04,0
knowest

191
02:52:04,0 --> 02:52:04,0
thy

192
02:52:04,0 --> 02:52:04,0
thoughts and

193
02:52:04,0 --> 02:52:04,0
the

194
02:52:04,0 --> 02:57:14,
intents of thy heart.

195
02:57:14,0 --> 02:57:14,0
17 I

196
02:57:14,0 --> 02:57:14,0
tell

197
02:57:14,0 --> 02:57:14,0

02:57:14,0 --> 02:57:14,0
these

199
02:57:14,0 --> 02:57:14,0
things as

02:57:14,0 --> 02:57:14,0
a

201
02:57:14,0 --> 02:57:14,0

202
02:57:14,0 --> 02:57:14,0
unto

203
02:57:14,0 --> 02:57:14,0


204
02:57:14,0 --> 02:57:14,0
thee—that the

205
02:57:14,0 --> 02:57:14,0
words

206
02:57:14,0 --> 02:57:14,0
or the

207

Therefore be

Joseph,

223
02:58:26,0 --> 02:58:26,0


224
02:58:26,0 --> 02:58:26,0
