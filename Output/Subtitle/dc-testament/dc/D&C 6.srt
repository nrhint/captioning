00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:20,028
Section 6 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet and 

2
00:00:20,028 --> 00:00:28,778
Oliver Cowdery, at Harmony, Pennsylvania, April 1829. Oliver Cowdery began 

3
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:37,528
his labors as scribe in the translation of the Book 

4
00:00:37,528 --> 00:00:46,278
of Mormon, April 7, 1829. He had already received a 

5
00:00:46,278 --> 00:00:55,028
divine manifestation of the truth of the Prophet’s testimony respecting 

6
00:00:55,028 --> 00:01:03,778
the plates on which was engraved the Book of Mormon 

7
00:01:03,778 --> 00:01:12,528
record. The Prophet inquired of the Lord through the Urim 

8
00:01:12,528 --> 00:01:21,278
and Thummim and received this response. 
1–6, Laborers in the 

9
00:01:21,278 --> 00:01:30,028
Lord’s field gain salvation; 
7–13, There is no gift greater 

10
00:01:30,028 --> 00:01:38,778
than the gift of salvation; 
14–27, A witness of the 

11
00:01:38,778 --> 00:01:47,528
truth comes by the power of the Spirit; 
28–37, Look 

12
00:01:47,528 --> 00:01:56,278
unto Christ, and do good continually.  

13
00:01:56,45 --> 00:02:01,95
1 A great and marvelous work is about to come 

14
00:02:01,95 --> 00:02:07,45
forth unto the children of men. 

15
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:14,477
2 Behold, I am God; give heed unto my word, 

16
00:02:14,477 --> 00:02:21,727
which is quick and powerful, sharper than a two-edged sword, 

17
00:02:21,727 --> 00:02:28,977
to the dividing asunder of both joints and marrow; therefore 

18
00:02:28,977 --> 00:02:36,227
give heed unto my words. 

19
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:43,356
3 Behold, the field is white already to harvest; therefore, 

20
00:02:43,356 --> 00:02:50,156
whoso desireth to reap, let him thrust in his sickle 

21
00:02:50,156 --> 00:02:56,956
with his might, and reap while the day lasts, that 

22
00:02:56,956 --> 00:03:03,756
he may treasure up for his soul everlasting salvation in 

23
00:03:03,756 --> 00:03:10,556
the kingdom of God. 

24
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:15,023
4 Yea, whosoever will thrust in his sickle and reap, 

25
00:03:15,023 --> 00:03:20,023
the same is called of God. 

26
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:23,567
5 Therefore, if you will ask of me you shall 

27
00:03:23,567 --> 00:03:26,567
receive; if you will knock it shall be opened unto 

28
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:29,567
you. 

29
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:35,609
6 Now, as you have asked, behold, I say unto 

30
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:41,609
you, keep my commandments, and seek to bring forth and 

31
00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:47,609
establish the cause of Zion; 

32
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:55,394
7 Seek not for riches but for wisdom, and behold, 

33
00:03:55,394 --> 00:04:02,894
the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto you, and 

34
00:04:02,894 --> 00:04:10,394
then shall you be made rich. Behold, he that hath 

35
00:04:10,394 --> 00:04:17,894
eternal life is rich. 

36
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:22,191
8 Verily, verily, I say unto you, even as you 

37
00:04:22,191 --> 00:04:26,691
desire of me so it shall be unto you; and 

38
00:04:26,691 --> 00:04:31,191
if you desire, you shall be the means of doing 

39
00:04:31,191 --> 00:04:35,691
much good in this generation. 

40
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:42,542
9 Say nothing but repentance unto this generation; keep my 

41
00:04:42,542 --> 00:04:49,875
commandments, and assist to bring forth my work, according to 

42
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:57,208
my commandments, and you shall be blessed. 

43
00:04:57,197 --> 00:05:01,864
10 Behold thou hast a gift, and blessed art thou 

44
00:05:01,864 --> 00:05:06,53
because of thy gift. Remember it is sacred and cometh 

45
00:05:06,53 --> 00:05:11,197
from above— 

46
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:18,278
11 And if thou wilt inquire, thou shalt know mysteries 

47
00:05:18,278 --> 00:05:25,078
which are great and marvelous; therefore thou shalt exercise thy 

48
00:05:25,078 --> 00:05:31,878
gift, that thou mayest find out mysteries, that thou mayest 

49
00:05:31,878 --> 00:05:38,678
bring many to the knowledge of the truth, yea, convince 

50
00:05:38,678 --> 00:05:45,478
them of the error of their ways. 

51
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:50,078
12 Make not thy gift known unto any save it 

52
00:05:50,078 --> 00:05:54,745
be those who are of thy faith. Trifle not with 

53
00:05:54,745 --> 00:05:59,412
sacred things. 

54
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:04,559
13 If thou wilt do good, yea, and hold out 

55
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:09,959
faithful to the end, thou shalt be saved in the 

56
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:15,359
kingdom of God, which is the greatest of all the 

57
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:20,759
gifts of God; for there is no gift greater than 

58
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:26,159
the gift of salvation. 

59
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:31,119
14 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, blessed art thou 

60
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:36,119
for what thou hast done; for thou hast inquired of 

61
00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:41,119
me, and behold, as often as thou hast inquired thou 

62
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:46,119
hast received instruction of my Spirit. If it had not 

63
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:51,119
been so, thou wouldst not have come to the place 

64
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:56,119
where thou art at this time. 

65
00:06:56,65 --> 00:07:02,65
15 Behold, thou knowest that thou hast inquired of me 

66
00:07:02,65 --> 00:07:08,65
and I did enlighten thy mind; and now I tell 

67
00:07:08,65 --> 00:07:14,65
thee these things that thou mayest know that thou hast 

68
00:07:14,65 --> 00:07:20,65
been enlightened by the Spirit of truth; 

69
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:25,44
16 Yea, I tell thee, that thou mayest know that 

70
00:07:25,44 --> 00:07:30,773
there is none else save God that knowest thy thoughts 

71
00:07:30,773 --> 00:07:36,106
and the intents of thy heart. 

72
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:41,923
17 I tell thee these things as a witness unto 

73
00:07:41,923 --> 00:07:46,923
thee—that the words or the work which thou hast been 

74
00:07:46,923 --> 00:07:51,923
writing are true. 

75
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:56,104
18 Therefore be diligent; stand by my servant Joseph, faithfully, 

76
00:07:56,104 --> 00:08:00,771
in whatsoever difficult circumstances he may be for the word’s 

77
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:05,438
sake. 

78
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:11,185
19 Admonish him in his faults, and also receive admonition 

79
00:08:11,185 --> 00:08:17,185
of him. Be patient; be sober; be temperate; have patience, 

80
00:08:17,185 --> 00:08:23,185
faith, hope and charity. 

81
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:29,369
20 Behold, thou art Oliver, and I have spoken unto 

82
00:08:29,369 --> 00:08:35,569
thee because of thy desires; therefore treasure up these words 

83
00:08:35,569 --> 00:08:41,769
in thy heart. Be faithful and diligent in keeping the 

84
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:47,969
commandments of God, and I will encircle thee in the 

85
00:08:47,969 --> 00:08:54,169
arms of my love. 

86
00:08:54,601 --> 00:09:01,101
21 Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God. 

87
00:09:01,101 --> 00:09:07,601
I am the same that came unto mine own, and 

88
00:09:07,601 --> 00:09:14,101
mine own received me not. I am the light which 

89
00:09:14,101 --> 00:09:20,601
shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehendeth it not. 

90
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:25,076
22 Verily, verily, I say unto you, if you desire 

91
00:09:25,076 --> 00:09:29,826
a further witness, cast your mind upon the night that 

92
00:09:29,826 --> 00:09:34,576
you cried unto me in your heart, that you might 

93
00:09:34,576 --> 00:09:39,326
know concerning the truth of these things. 

94
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:43,312
23 Did I not speak peace to your mind concerning 

95
00:09:43,312 --> 00:09:47,312
the matter? What greater witness can you have than from 

96
00:09:47,312 --> 00:09:51,312
God? 

97
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:59,325
24 And now, behold, you have received a witness; for 

98
00:09:59,325 --> 00:10:06,658
if I have told you things which no man knoweth 

99
00:10:06,658 --> 00:10:13,991
have you not received a witness? 

100
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:17,513
25 And, behold, I grant unto you a gift, if 

101
00:10:17,513 --> 00:10:21,513
you desire of me, to translate, even as my servant 

102
00:10:21,513 --> 00:10:25,513
Joseph. 

103
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:31,225
26 Verily, verily, I say unto you, that there are 

104
00:10:31,225 --> 00:10:36,892
records which contain much of my gospel, which have been 

105
00:10:36,892 --> 00:10:42,558
kept back because of the wickedness of the people; 

106
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:49,076
27 And now I command you, that if you have 

107
00:10:49,076 --> 00:10:55,276
good desires—a desire to lay up treasures for yourself in 

108
00:10:55,276 --> 00:11:01,476
heaven—then shall you assist in bringing to light, with your 

109
00:11:01,476 --> 00:11:07,676
gift, those parts of my scriptures which have been hidden 

110
00:11:07,676 --> 00:11:13,876
because of iniquity. 

111
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:21,106
28 And now, behold, I give unto you, and also 

112
00:11:21,106 --> 00:11:29,106
unto my servant Joseph, the keys of this gift, which 

113
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:37,106
shall bring to light this ministry; and in the mouth 

114
00:11:37,106 --> 00:11:45,106
of two or three witnesses shall every word be established. 

115
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:52,871
29 Verily, verily, I say unto you, if they reject 

116
00:11:52,871 --> 00:12:00,371
my words, and this part of my gospel and ministry, 

117
00:12:00,371 --> 00:12:07,871
blessed are ye, for they can do no more unto 

118
00:12:07,871 --> 00:12:15,371
you than unto me. 

119
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:21,968
30 And even if they do unto you even as 

120
00:12:21,968 --> 00:12:28,635
they have done unto me, blessed are ye, for you 

121
00:12:28,635 --> 00:12:35,301
shall dwell with me in glory. 

122
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:41,871
31 But if they reject not my words, which shall 

123
00:12:41,871 --> 00:12:48,621
be established by the testimony which shall be given, blessed 

124
00:12:48,621 --> 00:12:55,371
are they, and then shall ye have joy in the 

125
00:12:55,371 --> 00:13:02,121
fruit of your labors. 

126
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:07,449
32 Verily, verily, I say unto you, as I said 

127
00:13:07,449 --> 00:13:12,249
unto my disciples, where two or three are gathered together 

128
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:17,049
in my name, as touching one thing, behold, there will 

129
00:13:17,049 --> 00:13:21,849
I be in the midst of them—even so am I 

130
00:13:21,849 --> 00:13:26,649
in the midst of you. 

131
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:35,639
33 Fear not to do good, my sons, for whatsoever 

132
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:44,306
ye sow, that shall ye also reap; therefore, if ye 

133
00:13:44,306 --> 00:13:52,973
sow good ye shall also reap good for your reward. 

134
00:13:52,932 --> 00:14:02,599
34 Therefore, fear not, little flock; do good; let earth 

135
00:14:02,599 --> 00:14:12,265
and hell combine against you, for if ye are built 

136
00:14:12,265 --> 00:14:21,932
upon my rock, they cannot prevail. 

137
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:28,327
35 Behold, I do not condemn you; go your ways 

138
00:14:28,327 --> 00:14:34,994
and sin no more; perform with soberness the work which 

139
00:14:34,994 --> 00:14:41,661
I have commanded you. 

140
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:47,981
36 Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear 

141
00:14:47,981 --> 00:14:53,981
not. 

142
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:57,009
37 Behold the wounds which pierced my side, and also 

143
00:14:57,009 --> 00:15:00,759
the prints of the nails in my hands and feet; 

144
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:04,509
be faithful, keep my commandments, and ye shall inherit the 

145
00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:08,259
kingdom of heaven. Amen.
