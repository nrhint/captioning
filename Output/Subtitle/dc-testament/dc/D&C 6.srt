00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:18,778
Section 6 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:18,778 --> 00:00:26,278
 Prophet and Oliver Cowdery, at Harmony, Pennsylvania,

3
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:33,778
 April 1829. Oliver Cowdery began his labors as

4
00:00:33,778 --> 00:00:41,278
 scribe in the translation of the Book of Mormon,

5
00:00:41,278 --> 00:00:48,778
 April 7, 1829. He had already received a divine

6
00:00:48,778 --> 00:00:56,278
 manifestation of the truth of the Prophet’s testimony

7
00:00:56,278 --> 00:01:03,778
 respecting the plates on which was engraved the

8
00:01:03,778 --> 00:01:11,278
 Book of Mormon record. The Prophet inquired of the

9
00:01:11,278 --> 00:01:18,778
 Lord through the Urim and Thummim and received this

10
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:26,278
 response. 
1–6, Laborers in the Lord’s field gain

11
00:01:26,278 --> 00:01:33,778
 salvation; 
7–13, There is no gift greater than

12
00:01:33,778 --> 00:01:41,278
 the gift of salvation; 
14–27, A witness of the

13
00:01:41,278 --> 00:01:48,778
 truth comes by the power of the Spirit; 
28–37, Look

14
00:01:48,778 --> 00:01:56,278
 unto Christ, and do good continually.

15
00:01:56,45 --> 00:02:01,95
1 A great and marvelous work is about to come

16
00:02:01,95 --> 00:02:07,45
 forth unto the children of men

17
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:14,477
2 Behold, I am God; give heed unto my word, which

18
00:02:14,477 --> 00:02:21,727
 is quick and powerful, sharper than a two-edged

19
00:02:21,727 --> 00:02:28,977
 sword, to the dividing asunder of both joints and

20
00:02:28,977 --> 00:02:36,227
 marrow; therefore give heed unto my words

21
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:43,356
3 Behold, the field is white already to harvest;

22
00:02:43,356 --> 00:02:50,156
 therefore, whoso desireth to reap, let him thrust

23
00:02:50,156 --> 00:02:56,956
 in his sickle with his might, and reap while the

24
00:02:56,956 --> 00:03:03,756
 day lasts, that he may treasure up for his soul

25
00:03:03,756 --> 00:03:10,556
 everlasting salvation in the kingdom of God

26
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:15,023
4 Yea, whosoever will thrust in his sickle and

27
00:03:15,023 --> 00:03:20,023
 reap, the same is called of God

28
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:23,567
5 Therefore, if you will ask of me you shall

29
00:03:23,567 --> 00:03:26,567
 receive; if you will knock it shall be opened unto you

30
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:29,567


31
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:35,609
6 Now, as you have asked, behold, I say unto you,

32
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:41,609
 keep my commandments, and seek to bring forth and

33
00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:47,609
 establish the cause of Zion

34
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:55,394
7 Seek not for riches but for wisdom, and behold,

35
00:03:55,394 --> 00:04:02,894
 the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto you,

36
00:04:02,894 --> 00:04:10,394
 and then shall you be made rich. Behold, he that

37
00:04:10,394 --> 00:04:17,894
 hath eternal life is rich

38
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:22,191
8 Verily, verily, I say unto you, even as you

39
00:04:22,191 --> 00:04:26,691
 desire of me so it shall be unto you; and if you

40
00:04:26,691 --> 00:04:31,191
 desire, you shall be the means of doing much good in

41
00:04:31,191 --> 00:04:35,691
 this generation

42
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:40,708
9 Say nothing but repentance unto this generation;

43
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:46,208
 keep my commandments, and assist to bring forth

44
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:51,708
 my work, according to my commandments, and you

45
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:57,208
 shall be blessed

46
00:04:57,197 --> 00:05:01,864
10 Behold thou hast a gift, and blessed art thou

47
00:05:01,864 --> 00:05:06,531
 because of thy gift. Remember it is sacred and

48
00:05:06,531 --> 00:05:11,198
 cometh from above

49
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:17,145
11 And if thou wilt inquire, thou shalt know

50
00:05:17,145 --> 00:05:22,812
 mysteries which are great and marvelous; therefore thou

51
00:05:22,812 --> 00:05:28,479
 shalt exercise thy gift, that thou mayest find

52
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:34,146
 out mysteries, that thou mayest bring many to the

53
00:05:34,146 --> 00:05:39,813
 knowledge of the truth, yea, convince them of the

54
00:05:39,813 --> 00:05:45,48
 error of their ways

55
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:50,079
12 Make not thy gift known unto any save it be

56
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:54,746
 those who are of thy faith. Trifle not with sacred

57
00:05:54,746 --> 00:05:59,413
 things

58
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:04,559
13 If thou wilt do good, yea, and hold out

59
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:09,959
 faithful to the end, thou shalt be saved in the kingdom

60
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:15,359
 of God, which is the greatest of all the gifts of

61
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:20,759
 God; for there is no gift greater than the gift of

62
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:26,159
 salvation

63
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:31,119
14 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, blessed art

64
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:36,119
 thou for what thou hast done; for thou hast inquired

65
00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:41,119
 of me, and behold, as often as thou hast inquired

66
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:46,119
 thou hast received instruction of my Spirit. If

67
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:51,119
 it had not been so, thou wouldst not have come to

68
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:56,119
 the place where thou art at this time

69
00:06:56,65 --> 00:07:02,65
15 Behold, thou knowest that thou hast inquired of

70
00:07:02,65 --> 00:07:08,65
 me and I did enlighten thy mind; and now I tell

71
00:07:08,65 --> 00:07:14,65
 thee these things that thou mayest know that thou

72
00:07:14,65 --> 00:07:20,65
 hast been enlightened by the Spirit of truth

73
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:25,439
16 Yea, I tell thee, that thou mayest know that

74
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:30,772
 there is none else save God that knowest thy

75
00:07:30,772 --> 00:07:36,105
 thoughts and the intents of thy heart

76
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:41,923
17 I tell thee these things as a witness unto

77
00:07:41,923 --> 00:07:46,923
 thee—that the words or the work which thou hast been

78
00:07:46,923 --> 00:07:51,923
 writing are true

79
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:56,105
18 Therefore be diligent; stand by my servant

80
00:07:56,105 --> 00:08:00,772
 Joseph, faithfully, in whatsoever difficult

81
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:05,439
 circumstances he may be for the word’s sake

82
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:11,185
19 Admonish him in his faults, and also receive

83
00:08:11,185 --> 00:08:17,185
 admonition of him. Be patient; be sober; be

84
00:08:17,185 --> 00:08:23,185
 temperate; have patience, faith, hope and charity

85
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:29,369
20 Behold, thou art Oliver, and I have spoken unto

86
00:08:29,369 --> 00:08:35,569
 thee because of thy desires; therefore treasure

87
00:08:35,569 --> 00:08:41,769
 up these words in thy heart. Be faithful and

88
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:47,969
 diligent in keeping the commandments of God, and I will

89
00:08:47,969 --> 00:08:54,169
 encircle thee in the arms of my love

90
00:08:54,601 --> 00:09:01,101
21 Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I am

91
00:09:01,101 --> 00:09:07,601
 the same that came unto mine own, and mine own

92
00:09:07,601 --> 00:09:14,101
 received me not. I am the light which shineth in

93
00:09:14,101 --> 00:09:20,601
 darkness, and the darkness comprehendeth it not

94
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:25,076
22 Verily, verily, I say unto you, if you desire a

95
00:09:25,076 --> 00:09:29,826
 further witness, cast your mind upon the night

96
00:09:29,826 --> 00:09:34,576
 that you cried unto me in your heart, that you might

97
00:09:34,576 --> 00:09:39,326
 know concerning the truth of these things

98
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:43,312
23 Did I not speak peace to your mind concerning

99
00:09:43,312 --> 00:09:47,312
 the matter? What greater witness can you have than

100
00:09:47,312 --> 00:09:51,312
 from God

101
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:59,324
24 And now, behold, you have received a witness;

102
00:09:59,324 --> 00:10:06,657
 for if I have told you things which no man knoweth

103
00:10:06,657 --> 00:10:13,99
 have you not received a witness

104
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:17,513
25 And, behold, I grant unto you a gift, if you

105
00:10:17,513 --> 00:10:21,513
 desire of me, to translate, even as my servant

106
00:10:21,513 --> 00:10:25,513
 Joseph

107
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:29,808
26 Verily, verily, I say unto you, that there are

108
00:10:29,808 --> 00:10:34,058
 records which contain much of my gospel, which

109
00:10:34,058 --> 00:10:38,308
 have been kept back because of the wickedness of the

110
00:10:38,308 --> 00:10:42,558
 people

111
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:49,076
27 And now I command you, that if you have good

112
00:10:49,076 --> 00:10:55,276
 desires—a desire to lay up treasures for yourself in

113
00:10:55,276 --> 00:11:01,476
 heaven—then shall you assist in bringing to

114
00:11:01,476 --> 00:11:07,676
 light, with your gift, those parts of my scriptures

115
00:11:07,676 --> 00:11:13,876
 which have been hidden because of iniquity

116
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:19,506
28 And now, behold, I give unto you, and also unto

117
00:11:19,506 --> 00:11:25,906
 my servant Joseph, the keys of this gift, which

118
00:11:25,906 --> 00:11:32,306
 shall bring to light this ministry; and in the

119
00:11:32,306 --> 00:11:38,706
 mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be

120
00:11:38,706 --> 00:11:45,106
 established

121
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:52,871
29 Verily, verily, I say unto you, if they reject

122
00:11:52,871 --> 00:12:00,371
 my words, and this part of my gospel and ministry,

123
00:12:00,371 --> 00:12:07,871
 blessed are ye, for they can do no more unto you

124
00:12:07,871 --> 00:12:15,371
 than unto me

125
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:21,968
30 And even if they do unto you even as they have

126
00:12:21,968 --> 00:12:28,635
 done unto me, blessed are ye, for you shall dwell

127
00:12:28,635 --> 00:12:35,302
 with me in glory

128
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:41,871
31 But if they reject not my words, which shall be

129
00:12:41,871 --> 00:12:48,621
 established by the testimony which shall be

130
00:12:48,621 --> 00:12:55,371
 given, blessed are they, and then shall ye have joy in

131
00:12:55,371 --> 00:13:02,121
 the fruit of your labors

132
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:07,449
32 Verily, verily, I say unto you, as I said unto

133
00:13:07,449 --> 00:13:12,249
 my disciples, where two or three are gathered

134
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:17,049
 together in my name, as touching one thing, behold,

135
00:13:17,049 --> 00:13:21,849
 there will I be in the midst of them—even so am I in

136
00:13:21,849 --> 00:13:26,649
 the midst of you

137
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:35,64
33 Fear not to do good, my sons, for whatsoever ye

138
00:13:35,64 --> 00:13:44,307
 sow, that shall ye also reap; therefore, if ye

139
00:13:44,307 --> 00:13:52,974
 sow good ye shall also reap good for your reward

140
00:13:52,932 --> 00:14:02,599
34 Therefore, fear not, little flock; do good; let

141
00:14:02,599 --> 00:14:12,266
 earth and hell combine against you, for if ye are

142
00:14:12,266 --> 00:14:21,933
 built upon my rock, they cannot prevail

143
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:28,328
35 Behold, I do not condemn you; go your ways and

144
00:14:28,328 --> 00:14:34,995
 sin no more; perform with soberness the work which

145
00:14:34,995 --> 00:14:41,662
 I have commanded you

146
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:47,981
36 Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear

147
00:14:47,981 --> 00:14:53,981
 not

148
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:57,009
37 Behold the wounds which pierced my side, and

149
00:14:57,009 --> 00:15:00,759
 also the prints of the nails in my hands and feet;

150
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:04,509
 be faithful, keep my commandments, and ye shall

151
00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:08,259
 inherit the kingdom of heaven. Amen.
