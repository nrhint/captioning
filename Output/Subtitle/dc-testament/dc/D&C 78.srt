1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 78 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, March 1, 1832.

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
On that day, the Prophet and other leaders had

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
assembled to discuss Church business. This

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
revelation originally instructed the Prophet, Sidney

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Rigdon, and Newel K. Whitney to travel to

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Missouri and organize the Church’s mercantile and

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
publishing endeavors by creating a “firm” that would

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
oversee these efforts, generating funds for the

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
establishment of Zion and for the benefit of the

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
poor. This firm, known as the United Firm, was

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
organized in April 1832 and disbanded in 1834

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
(see 
section 82). Sometime after its dissolution,

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
under the direction of Joseph Smith, the phrase

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
“the affairs of the storehouse for the poor”

16
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
replaced “mercantile and publishing

17
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
establishments” in the revelation, and the word “order”

18
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
replaced the word “firm.” 
1–4, The Saints should

19
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
organize and establish a storehouse; 
5–12, Wise use

20
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of their properties will lead to salvation;

21
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
13–14, The Church should be independent of earthly

22
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
powers; 
15–16, Michael (Adam) serves under the

23
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
direction of the Holy One (Christ); 
17–22,

24
00:00:00,0 --> 03:12:40,
Blessed are the faithful, for they will inherit all things. 

25
03:12:40,0 --> 03:12:40,0
1 The Lord spake unto Joseph Smith, Jun.,

26
03:12:40,0 --> 03:12:40,0
saying: Hearken unto me, saith the Lord your God,

27
03:12:40,0 --> 03:12:40,0
who are ordained unto the high priesthood of

28
03:12:40,0 --> 03:19:42,
my church, who have assembled yourselves together;

29
03:19:42,0 --> 03:19:42,0
2 And listen to the counsel of him who has

30
03:19:42,0 --> 03:19:42,0
ordained you from on high, who shall speak in

31
03:19:42,0 --> 03:19:42,0
your ears the words of wisdom, that

32
03:19:42,0 --> 03:19:42,0
salvation may be unto you in that thing which you

33
03:19:42,0 --> 03:29:45,
have presented before me, saith the Lord God.

34
03:29:45,0 --> 03:29:45,0
3 For verily I say unto you, the time

35
03:29:45,0 --> 03:29:45,0
has come, and is now at hand; and behold,

36
03:29:45,0 --> 03:29:45,0
and lo, it must needs be that there be

37
03:29:45,0 --> 03:29:45,0
an organization of my people, in

38
03:29:45,0 --> 03:29:45,0
regulating and establishing the affairs of the

39
03:29:45,0 --> 03:29:45,0
storehouse for the poor of my people,

40
03:29:45,0 --> 03:50:48,
both in this place and in the land of Zion—

41
03:50:48,0 --> 03:50:48,0
4 For a permanent and everlasting

42
03:50:48,0 --> 03:50:48,0
establishment and order unto my church, to

43
03:50:48,0 --> 03:50:48,0
advance the cause, which ye have

44
03:50:48,0 --> 03:50:48,0
espoused, to the salvation of man, and to

45
03:50:48,0 --> 04:15:49,
the glory of your Father who is in heaven;

46
04:15:49,0 --> 04:15:49,0
5 That you may be equal in the

47
04:15:49,0 --> 04:15:49,0
bonds of heavenly things, yea,

48
04:15:49,0 --> 04:15:49,0
and earthly things also, for

49
04:15:49,0 --> 04:38:50,
the obtaining of heavenly things.

50
04:38:50,0 --> 04:38:50,0
6 For if ye are not equal in

51
04:38:50,0 --> 04:38:50,0
earthly things ye cannot be

52
04:38:50,0 --> 04:37:54,
equal in obtaining heavenly things;

53
04:37:54,0 --> 04:37:54,0
7 For if you will that I

54
04:37:54,0 --> 04:37:54,0
give unto you a place in the

55
04:37:54,0 --> 04:37:54,0
celestial world, you must

56
04:37:54,0 --> 04:37:54,0
prepare yourselves by doing

57
04:37:54,0 --> 04:37:54,0
the things which I have

58
04:37:54,0 --> 04:39:58,
commanded you and required of you.

59
04:39:58,0 --> 04:39:58,0
8 And now, verily thus

60
04:39:58,0 --> 04:39:58,0
saith the Lord, it is

61
04:39:58,0 --> 04:39:58,0
expedient that all

62
04:39:58,0 --> 04:39:58,0
things be done unto my

63
04:39:58,0 --> 04:39:58,0
glory, by you who are joined

64
04:39:58,0 --> 04:55:00,
together in this order;

65
04:55:00,0 --> 04:55:00,0
9 Or, in other

66
04:55:00,0 --> 04:55:00,0
words, let my servant

67
04:55:00,0 --> 04:55:00,0
Newel K. Whitney and my

68
04:55:00,0 --> 04:55:00,0
servant Joseph

69
04:55:00,0 --> 04:55:00,0
Smith, Jun., and my

70
04:55:00,0 --> 04:55:00,0
servant Sidney Rigdon

71
04:55:00,0 --> 04:55:00,0
sit in council with

72
04:55:00,0 --> 05:04:02,
the saints which are in Zion;

73
05:04:02,0 --> 05:04:02,0
10 Otherwise Satan

74
05:04:02,0 --> 05:04:02,0
seeketh to turn

75
05:04:02,0 --> 05:04:02,0
their hearts away from

76
05:04:02,0 --> 05:04:02,0
the truth, that

77
05:04:02,0 --> 05:04:02,0
they become blinded

78
05:04:02,0 --> 05:04:02,0
and understand not

79
05:04:02,0 --> 05:04:02,0
the things which are

80
05:04:02,0 --> 05:24:37,
prepared for them.

81
05:24:37,0 --> 05:24:37,0
11 Wherefore, a

82
05:24:37,0 --> 05:24:37,0
commandment I give

83
05:24:37,0 --> 05:24:37,0
unto you, to

84
05:24:37,0 --> 05:24:37,0
prepare and organize

85
05:24:37,0 --> 05:24:37,0
yourselves by a

86
05:24:37,0 --> 05:24:37,0
bond or

87
05:24:37,0 --> 05:24:37,0
everlasting covenant that

88
05:24:37,0 --> 05:39:39,
cannot be broken.

89
05:39:39,0 --> 05:39:39,0
12 And he who

90
05:39:39,0 --> 05:39:39,0
breaketh it

91
05:39:39,0 --> 05:39:39,0
shall lose his

92
05:39:39,0 --> 05:39:39,0
office and standing

93
05:39:39,0 --> 05:39:39,0
in the church,

94
05:39:39,0 --> 05:39:39,0
and shall be

95
05:39:39,0 --> 05:39:39,0
delivered over

96
05:39:39,0 --> 05:39:39,0
to the

97
05:39:39,0 --> 05:39:39,0
buffetings of Satan

98
05:39:39,0 --> 06:02:40,
until the day of redemption.

99
06:02:40,0 --> 06:02:40,0
13 Behold,

100
06:02:40,0 --> 06:02:40,0
this is the

101
06:02:40,0 --> 06:02:40,0
preparation

102
06:02:40,0 --> 06:02:40,0
wherewith I prepare

103
06:02:40,0 --> 06:02:40,0
you, and the

104
06:02:40,0 --> 06:02:40,0
foundation, and

105
06:02:40,0 --> 06:02:40,0
the ensample

106
06:02:40,0 --> 06:02:40,0
which I give

107
06:02:40,0 --> 06:02:40,0
unto you,

108
06:02:40,0 --> 06:02:40,0
whereby you may

109
06:02:40,0 --> 06:02:40,0
accomplish the

110
06:02:40,0 --> 06:02:40,0
commandments

111
06:02:40,0 --> 06:13:40,
which are given you;

112
06:13:40,0 --> 06:13:40,0
14 That

113
06:13:40,0 --> 06:13:40,0
through my

114
06:13:40,0 --> 06:13:40,0
providence,

115
06:13:40,0 --> 06:13:40,0
notwithstanding the

116
06:13:40,0 --> 06:13:40,0
tribulation

117
06:13:40,0 --> 06:13:40,0
which shall

118
06:13:40,0 --> 06:13:40,0
descend upon

119
06:13:40,0 --> 06:13:40,0
you, that the

120
06:13:40,0 --> 06:13:40,0
church may

121
06:13:40,0 --> 06:13:40,0
stand independent

122
06:13:40,0 --> 06:13:40,0
above all

123
06:13:40,0 --> 06:13:40,0
other creatures

124
06:13:40,0 --> 06:13:40,0
beneath the

125
06:13:40,0 --> 06:20:43,
celestial world;

126
06:20:43,0 --> 06:20:43,0
15 That you

127
06:20:43,0 --> 06:20:43,0
may come up

128
06:20:43,0 --> 06:20:43,0
unto the

129
06:20:43,0 --> 06:20:43,0
crown prepared

130
06:20:43,0 --> 06:20:43,0
for you, and

131
06:20:43,0 --> 06:20:43,0
be made

132
06:20:43,0 --> 06:20:43,0
rulers over

133
06:20:43,0 --> 06:20:43,0
many kingdoms,

134
06:20:43,0 --> 06:20:43,0
saith the

135
06:20:43,0 --> 06:20:43,0
Lord God, the

136
06:20:43,0 --> 06:20:43,0
Holy One of

137
06:20:43,0 --> 06:20:43,0
Zion, who

138
06:20:43,0 --> 06:20:43,0
hath

139
06:20:43,0 --> 06:20:43,0
established the

140
06:20:43,0 --> 06:21:47,
foundations of Adam-ondi-Ahman;

141
06:21:47,0 --> 06:21:47,0
16 Who hath

142
06:21:47,0 --> 06:21:47,0
appointed

143
06:21:47,0 --> 06:21:47,0
Michael

144
06:21:47,0 --> 06:21:47,0
your prince,

145
06:21:47,0 --> 06:21:47,0
and

146
06:21:47,0 --> 06:21:47,0
established his

147
06:21:47,0 --> 06:21:47,0
feet, and set

148
06:21:47,0 --> 06:21:47,0
him upon

149
06:21:47,0 --> 06:21:47,0
high, and

150
06:21:47,0 --> 06:21:47,0
given unto him

151
06:21:47,0 --> 06:21:47,0
the keys

152
06:21:47,0 --> 06:21:47,0
of salvation

153
06:21:47,0 --> 06:21:47,0
under the

154
06:21:47,0 --> 06:21:47,0
counsel and

155
06:21:47,0 --> 06:21:47,0
direction

156
06:21:47,0 --> 06:21:47,0
of the Holy

157
06:21:47,0 --> 06:21:47,0
One, who

158
06:21:47,0 --> 06:21:47,0
is without

159
06:21:47,0 --> 06:21:47,0
beginning of

160
06:21:47,0 --> 06:21:25,
days or end of life.

161
06:21:25,0 --> 06:21:25,0
17 Verily,

162
06:21:25,0 --> 06:21:25,0
verily, I

163
06:21:25,0 --> 06:21:25,0
say unto

164
06:21:25,0 --> 06:21:25,0
you, ye

165
06:21:25,0 --> 06:21:25,0
are little

166
06:21:25,0 --> 06:21:25,0
children,

167
06:21:25,0 --> 06:21:25,0
and ye have

168
06:21:25,0 --> 06:21:25,0
not as

169
06:21:25,0 --> 06:21:25,0
yet

170
06:21:25,0 --> 06:21:25,0
understood how

171
06:21:25,0 --> 06:21:25,0
great

172
06:21:25,0 --> 06:21:25,0
blessings the

173
06:21:25,0 --> 06:21:25,0
Father hath

174
06:21:25,0 --> 06:21:25,0
in his own

175
06:21:25,0 --> 06:21:25,0
hands and

176
06:21:25,0 --> 06:23:29,
prepared for you;

177
06:23:29,0 --> 06:23:29,0
18 And ye

178
06:23:29,0 --> 06:23:29,0
cannot

179
06:23:29,0 --> 06:23:29,0
bear all

180
06:23:29,0 --> 06:23:29,0
things

181
06:23:29,0 --> 06:23:29,0
now;

182
06:23:29,0 --> 06:23:29,0
nevertheless, be

183
06:23:29,0 --> 06:23:29,0
of good

184
06:23:29,0 --> 06:23:29,0
cheer,

185
06:23:29,0 --> 06:23:29,0
for I will

186
06:23:29,0 --> 06:23:29,0
lead you

187
06:23:29,0 --> 06:23:29,0
along.

188
06:23:29,0 --> 06:23:29,0
The kingdom

189
06:23:29,0 --> 06:23:29,0
is yours

190
06:23:29,0 --> 06:23:29,0
and the

191
06:23:29,0 --> 06:23:29,0
blessings

192
06:23:29,0 --> 06:23:29,0
thereof

193
06:23:29,0 --> 06:23:29,0
are

194
06:23:29,0 --> 06:23:29,0
yours, and the

195
06:23:29,0 --> 06:23:29,0
riches

196
06:23:29,0 --> 06:37:33,
of eternity are yours.

197
06:37:33,0 --> 06:37:33,0
19 And

198
06:37:33,0 --> 06:37:33,0
he who

199
06:37:33,0 --> 06:37:33,0
receiveth

200
06:37:33,0 --> 06:37:33,0
all

201
06:37:33,0 --> 06:37:33,0
things with

202
06:37:33,0 --> 06:37:33,0


203
06:37:33,0 --> 06:37:33,0
thankfulness

204
06:37:33,0 --> 06:37:33,0
shall be

205
06:37:33,0 --> 06:37:33,0
made

206
06:37:33,0 --> 06:37:33,0
glorious; and

207
06:37:33,0 --> 06:37:33,0
the

208
06:37:33,0 --> 06:37:33,0
things of

209
06:37:33,0 --> 06:37:33,0
this

210
06:37:33,0 --> 06:37:33,0
earth shall

211
06:37:33,0 --> 06:37:33,0
be added

212
06:37:33,0 --> 06:37:33,0
unto

213
06:37:33,0 --> 06:37:33,0
him, even

214
06:37:33,0 --> 06:37:33,0
an

215
06:37:33,0 --> 06:33:13,
hundred fold, yea, more.

216
06:33:13,0 --> 06:33:13,0
20

217
06:33:13,0 --> 06:33:13,0
Wherefore,

218
06:33:13,0 --> 06:33:13,0
do the

219
06:33:13,0 --> 06:33:13,0
things

220
06:33:13,0 --> 06:33:13,0
