1
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:18,861
Section 78 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:18,861 --> 00:00:26,444
 the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, March 1, 1832. On

3
00:00:26,444 --> 00:00:34,027
 that day, the Prophet and other leaders had

4
00:00:34,027 --> 00:00:41,61
 assembled to discuss Church business. This revelation

5
00:00:41,61 --> 00:00:49,193
 originally instructed the Prophet, Sidney Rigdon, and

6
00:00:49,193 --> 00:00:56,776
 Newel K. Whitney to travel to Missouri and

7
00:00:56,776 --> 00:01:04,359
 organize the Church’s mercantile and publishing

8
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:11,942
 endeavors by creating a “firm” that would oversee these

9
00:01:11,942 --> 00:01:19,525
 efforts, generating funds for the establishment of

10
00:01:19,525 --> 00:01:27,108
 Zion and for the benefit of the poor. This firm,

11
00:01:27,108 --> 00:01:34,691
 known as the United Firm, was organized in April

12
00:01:34,691 --> 00:01:42,274
 1832 and disbanded in 1834 (see 
section 82).

13
00:01:42,274 --> 00:01:49,857
 Sometime after its dissolution, under the direction of

14
00:01:49,857 --> 00:01:57,44
 Joseph Smith, the phrase “the affairs of the

15
00:01:57,44 --> 00:02:05,023
 storehouse for the poor” replaced “mercantile and

16
00:02:05,023 --> 00:02:12,606
 publishing establishments” in the revelation, and the

17
00:02:12,606 --> 00:02:20,189
 word “order” replaced the word “firm.” 
1–4, The

18
00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:27,772
 Saints should organize and establish a storehouse;

19
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:35,355
5–12, Wise use of their properties will lead to

20
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:42,938
 salvation; 
13–14, The Church should be independent of

21
00:02:42,938 --> 00:02:50,521
 earthly powers; 
15–16, Michael (Adam) serves

22
00:02:50,521 --> 00:02:58,104
 under the direction of the Holy One (Christ); 
17–22,

23
00:02:58,104 --> 00:03:05,687
 Blessed are the faithful, for they will inherit

24
00:03:05,687 --> 00:03:13,27
 all things.

25
00:03:13,81 --> 00:03:18,06
1 The Lord spake unto Joseph Smith, Jun., saying:

26
00:03:18,06 --> 00:03:22,31
 Hearken unto me, saith the Lord your God, who are

27
00:03:22,31 --> 00:03:26,56
 ordained unto the high priesthood of my church,

28
00:03:26,56 --> 00:03:30,81
 who have assembled yourselves together

29
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:35,244
2 And listen to the counsel of him who has

30
00:03:35,244 --> 00:03:39,644
 ordained you from on high, who shall speak in your ears

31
00:03:39,644 --> 00:03:44,044
 the words of wisdom, that salvation may be unto you

32
00:03:44,044 --> 00:03:48,444
 in that thing which you have presented before me,

33
00:03:48,444 --> 00:03:52,844
 saith the Lord God

34
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:56,516
3 For verily I say unto you, the time has come,

35
00:03:56,516 --> 00:04:00,683
 and is now at hand; and behold, and lo, it must

36
00:04:00,683 --> 00:04:04,85
 needs be that there be an organization of my people,

37
00:04:04,85 --> 00:04:09,017
 in regulating and establishing the affairs of the

38
00:04:09,017 --> 00:04:13,184
 storehouse for the poor of my people, both in this

39
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:17,351
 place and in the land of Zion

40
00:04:17,39 --> 00:04:23,14
4 For a permanent and everlasting establishment

41
00:04:23,14 --> 00:04:28,89
 and order unto my church, to advance the cause,

42
00:04:28,89 --> 00:04:34,64
 which ye have espoused, to the salvation of man, and

43
00:04:34,64 --> 00:04:40,39
 to the glory of your Father who is in heaven

44
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:45,881
5 That you may be equal in the bonds of heavenly

45
00:04:45,881 --> 00:04:50,881
 things, yea, and earthly things also, for the

46
00:04:50,881 --> 00:04:55,881
 obtaining of heavenly things

47
00:04:55,912 --> 00:05:00,912
6 For if ye are not equal in earthly things ye

48
00:05:00,912 --> 00:05:05,912
 cannot be equal in obtaining heavenly things

49
00:05:05,922 --> 00:05:10,922
7 For if you will that I give unto you a place in

50
00:05:10,922 --> 00:05:15,922
 the celestial world, you must prepare yourselves

51
00:05:15,922 --> 00:05:20,922
 by doing the things which I have commanded you and

52
00:05:20,922 --> 00:05:25,922
 required of you

53
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:30,791
8 And now, verily thus saith the Lord, it is

54
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:36,124
 expedient that all things be done unto my glory, by you

55
00:05:36,124 --> 00:05:41,457
 who are joined together in this order

56
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:46,941
9 Or, in other words, let my servant Newel K.

57
00:05:46,941 --> 00:05:52,441
 Whitney and my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and my

58
00:05:52,441 --> 00:05:57,941
 servant Sidney Rigdon sit in council with the saints

59
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:03,441
 which are in Zion

60
00:06:03,713 --> 00:06:08,713
10 Otherwise Satan seeketh to turn their hearts

61
00:06:08,713 --> 00:06:13,713
 away from the truth, that they become blinded and

62
00:06:13,713 --> 00:06:18,713
 understand not the things which are prepared for

63
00:06:18,713 --> 00:06:23,713
 them

64
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:28,216
11 Wherefore, a commandment I give unto you, to

65
00:06:28,216 --> 00:06:33,216
 prepare and organize yourselves by a bond or

66
00:06:33,216 --> 00:06:38,216
 everlasting covenant that cannot be broken

67
00:06:38,715 --> 00:06:43,215
12 And he who breaketh it shall lose his office

68
00:06:43,215 --> 00:06:47,715
 and standing in the church, and shall be delivered

69
00:06:47,715 --> 00:06:52,215
 over to the buffetings of Satan until the day of

70
00:06:52,215 --> 00:06:56,715
 redemption

71
00:06:56,483 --> 00:07:01,733
13 Behold, this is the preparation wherewith I

72
00:07:01,733 --> 00:07:06,983
 prepare you, and the foundation, and the ensample

73
00:07:06,983 --> 00:07:12,233
 which I give unto you, whereby you may accomplish the

74
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:17,483
 commandments which are given you

75
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:22,253
14 That through my providence, notwithstanding the

76
00:07:22,253 --> 00:07:27,503
 tribulation which shall descend upon you, that

77
00:07:27,503 --> 00:07:32,753
 the church may stand independent above all other

78
00:07:32,753 --> 00:07:38,003
 creatures beneath the celestial world

79
00:07:38,508 --> 00:07:45,258
15 That you may come up unto the crown prepared

80
00:07:45,258 --> 00:07:52,008
 for you, and be made rulers over many kingdoms,

81
00:07:52,008 --> 00:07:58,758
 saith the Lord God, the Holy One of Zion, who hath

82
00:07:58,758 --> 00:08:05,508
 established the foundations of Adam-ondi-Ahman

83
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:10,418
16 Who hath appointed Michael your prince, and

84
00:08:10,418 --> 00:08:15,818
 established his feet, and set him upon high, and

85
00:08:15,818 --> 00:08:21,218
 given unto him the keys of salvation under the counsel

86
00:08:21,218 --> 00:08:26,618
 and direction of the Holy One, who is without

87
00:08:26,618 --> 00:08:32,018
 beginning of days or end of life

88
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:36,762
17 Verily, verily, I say unto you, ye are little

89
00:08:36,762 --> 00:08:40,762
 children, and ye have not as yet understood how

90
00:08:40,762 --> 00:08:44,762
 great blessings the Father hath in his own hands and

91
00:08:44,762 --> 00:08:48,762
 prepared for you

92
00:08:48,511 --> 00:08:54,011
18 And ye cannot bear all things now;

93
00:08:54,011 --> 00:08:59,511
 nevertheless, be of good cheer, for I will lead you along. The

94
00:08:59,511 --> 00:09:05,011
 kingdom is yours and the blessings thereof are

95
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:10,511
 yours, and the riches of eternity are yours

96
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:14,266
19 And he who receiveth all things with

97
00:09:14,266 --> 00:09:18,516
 thankfulness shall be made glorious; and the things of this

98
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:22,766
 earth shall be added unto him, even an hundred

99
00:09:22,766 --> 00:09:27,016
 fold, yea, more

100
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:33,65
20 Wherefore, do the things which I have commanded

101
00:09:33,65 --> 00:09:39,983
 you, saith your Redeemer, even the Son Ahman, who

102
00:09:39,983 --> 00:09:46,316
 prepareth all things before he taketh you

103
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:52,386
21 For ye are the church of the Firstborn, and he

104
00:09:52,386 --> 00:09:58,386
 will take you up in a cloud, and appoint every man

105
00:09:58,386 --> 00:10:04,386
 his portion

106
00:10:04,154 --> 00:10:11,654
22 And he that is a faithful and wise steward

107
00:10:11,654 --> 00:10:19,154
 shall inherit all things. Amen.
