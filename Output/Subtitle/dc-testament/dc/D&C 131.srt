00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:17,778
Section 131 Instructions by Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:17,778 --> 00:00:24,278
 Prophet, given at Ramus, Illinois, May 16 and 17, 1843.

3
00:00:24,278 --> 00:00:30,778
1–4, Celestial marriage is essential to

4
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:37,278
 exaltation in the highest heaven; 
5–6, How men are sealed

5
00:00:37,278 --> 00:00:43,778
 up unto eternal life is explained; 
7–8, All

6
00:00:43,778 --> 00:00:50,278
 spirit is matter.

7
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:54,984
1 In the celestial glory there are three heavens

8
00:00:54,984 --> 00:00:59,484
 or degrees

9
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:03,359
2 And in order to obtain the highest, a man must

10
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,692
 enter into this order of the priesthood [meaning

11
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:12,025
 the new and everlasting covenant of marriage]

12
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:19,539
3 And if he does not, he cannot obtain it

13
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:25,079
4 He may enter into the other, but that is the end

14
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:31,079
 of his kingdom; he cannot have an increase

15
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:38,625
5 (May 17th, 1843.) The more sure word of prophecy

16
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:45,625
 means a man’s knowing that he is sealed up unto

17
00:01:45,625 --> 00:01:52,625
 eternal life, by revelation and the spirit of

18
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:59,625
 prophecy, through the power of the Holy Priesthood

19
00:01:59,603 --> 00:02:04,103
6 It is impossible for a man to be saved in

20
00:02:04,103 --> 00:02:08,603
 ignorance

21
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:18,296
7 There is no such thing as immaterial matter. All

22
00:02:18,296 --> 00:02:27,963
 spirit is matter, but it is more fine or pure,

23
00:02:27,963 --> 00:02:37,63
 and can only be discerned by purer eyes

24
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:43,157
8 We cannot see it; but when our bodies are

25
00:02:43,157 --> 00:02:49,157
 purified we shall see that it is all matter.
