00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 131 Instructions by Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Prophet, given at Ramus, Illinois, May 16

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and 17, 1843. 
1–4, Celestial marriage is

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
essential to exaltation in the highest heaven;

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
5–6, How men are sealed up unto eternal

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:48:58,
life is explained; 
7–8, All spirit is matter. 

7
00:48:58,0 --> 00:48:58,0
1 In the celestial glory there

8
00:48:58,0 --> 00:48:36,
are three heavens or degrees;

9
00:48:36,0 --> 00:48:36,0
2 And in order to obtain the

10
00:48:36,0 --> 00:48:36,0
highest, a man must enter

11
00:48:36,0 --> 00:48:36,0
into this order of the

12
00:48:36,0 --> 00:48:36,0
priesthood [meaning the new and

13
00:48:36,0 --> 00:44:16,
everlasting covenant of marriage];

14
00:44:16,0 --> 00:44:16,0
3 And if he does not,

15
00:44:16,0 --> 00:49:21,
he cannot obtain it.

16
00:49:21,0 --> 00:49:21,0
4 He may enter

17
00:49:21,0 --> 00:49:21,0
into the other, but

18
00:49:21,0 --> 00:49:21,0
that is the end of

19
00:49:21,0 --> 00:49:21,0
his kingdom; he

20
00:49:21,0 --> 00:58:24,
cannot have an increase.

21
00:58:24,0 --> 00:58:24,0
5 (May 17th,

22
00:58:24,0 --> 00:58:24,0
1843.) The more sure

23
00:58:24,0 --> 00:58:24,0
word of prophecy

24
00:58:24,0 --> 00:58:24,0
means a man’s

25
00:58:24,0 --> 00:58:24,0
knowing that he is

26
00:58:24,0 --> 00:58:24,0
sealed up unto

27
00:58:24,0 --> 00:58:24,0
eternal life, by

28
00:58:24,0 --> 00:58:24,0
revelation and the

29
00:58:24,0 --> 00:58:24,0
spirit of

30
00:58:24,0 --> 00:58:24,0
prophecy, through the

31
00:58:24,0 --> 01:11:28,
power of the Holy Priesthood.

32
01:11:28,0 --> 01:11:28,0
6 It is

33
01:11:28,0 --> 01:11:28,0
impossible for a

34
01:11:28,0 --> 01:11:28,0
man to be

35
01:11:28,0 --> 01:13:32,
saved in ignorance.

36
01:13:32,0 --> 01:13:32,0
7 There is

37
01:13:32,0 --> 01:13:32,0
no such thing

38
01:13:32,0 --> 01:13:32,0
as

39
01:13:32,0 --> 01:13:32,0
immaterial matter.

40
01:13:32,0 --> 01:13:32,0
All spirit is

41
01:13:32,0 --> 01:13:32,0
matter, but

42
01:13:32,0 --> 01:13:32,0
it is more

43
01:13:32,0 --> 01:13:32,0
fine or

44
01:13:32,0 --> 01:13:32,0
pure, and can

45
01:13:32,0 --> 01:13:32,0
only be

46
01:13:32,0 --> 01:18:37,
discerned by purer eyes;

47
01:18:37,0 --> 01:18:37,0
8 We cannot

48
01:18:37,0 --> 01:18:37,0
see it;

49
01:18:37,0 --> 01:18:37,0
but when our

50
01:18:37,0 --> 01:18:37,0
bodies are

51
01:18:37,0 --> 01:18:37,0
purified we

52
01:18:37,0 --> 01:18:37,0
shall see

53
01:18:37,0 --> 01:18:37,0
that it is

54
01:18:37,0 --> 01:30:43,
all matter.
