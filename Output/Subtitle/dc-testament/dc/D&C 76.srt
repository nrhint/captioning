00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 76 A vision given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Prophet and Sidney Rigdon, at Hiram, Ohio, February

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
16, 1832. Prefacing the record of this vision,

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Joseph Smith’s history states: “Upon my return from

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Amherst conference, I resumed the translation of

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Scriptures. From sundry revelations which

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
had been received, it was apparent that many

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
important points touching the salvation of man had been

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
taken from the Bible, or lost before it was

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
compiled. It appeared self-evident from what truths

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
were left, that if God rewarded every one

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
according to the deeds done in the body the term

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
‘Heaven,’ as intended for the Saints’ eternal home, must

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
include more kingdoms than one. Accordingly, …

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
while translating St. John’s Gospel, myself and

16
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Elder Rigdon saw the following vision.” At the time

17
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
this vision was given, the Prophet was

18
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
translating 
John 5:29. 
1–4, The Lord is God; 
5–10, The

19
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
mysteries of the kingdom will be revealed to all

20
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the faithful; 
11–17, All will come forth in the

21
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
resurrection of the just or the unjust; 
18–24,

22
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
The inhabitants of many worlds are begotten sons

23
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and daughters unto God through the Atonement of

24
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Jesus Christ; 
25–29, An angel of God fell and

25
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
became the devil; 
30–49, Sons of perdition suffer

26
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
eternal damnation; all others gain some degree of

27
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
salvation; 
50–70, The glory and reward of exalted

28
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
beings in the celestial kingdom is described;

29
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
71–80, Those who will inherit the terrestrial

30
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
kingdom are described; 
81–113, The status of those in

31
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the telestial, terrestrial, and celestial

32
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
glories is explained; 
114–19, The faithful may see and

33
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
understand the mysteries of God’s kingdom by the

34
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
power of the Holy Spirit. 
twenty-ninth verse of

35
00:00:00,0 --> 04:43:04,
the fifth chapter of John, which was given unto us as follows—

36
04:43:04,0 --> 04:43:04,0
1 Hear, O ye heavens, and give ear, O earth,

37
04:43:04,0 --> 04:43:04,0
and rejoice ye inhabitants thereof, for the

38
04:43:04,0 --> 05:01:35,
Lord is God, and beside him there is no Savior.

39
05:01:35,0 --> 05:01:35,0
2 Great is his wisdom,

40
05:01:35,0 --> 05:01:35,0
marvelous are his ways, and the extent

41
05:01:35,0 --> 05:05:14,
of his doings none can find out.

42
05:05:14,0 --> 05:05:14,0
3 His purposes fail

43
05:05:14,0 --> 05:05:14,0
not, neither are there any

44
05:05:14,0 --> 05:22:16,
who can stay his hand.

45
05:22:16,0 --> 05:22:16,0
4 From eternity to

46
05:22:16,0 --> 05:22:16,0
eternity he is the same,

47
05:22:16,0 --> 05:34:22,
and his years never fail.

48
05:34:22,0 --> 05:34:22,0
5 For thus saith the

49
05:34:22,0 --> 05:34:22,0
Lord—I, the Lord, am

50
05:34:22,0 --> 05:34:22,0
merciful and gracious

51
05:34:22,0 --> 05:34:22,0
unto those who fear

52
05:34:22,0 --> 05:34:22,0
me, and delight to

53
05:34:22,0 --> 05:34:22,0
honor those who serve

54
05:34:22,0 --> 05:34:22,0
me in righteousness

55
05:34:22,0 --> 05:46:28,
and in truth unto the end.

56
05:46:28,0 --> 05:46:28,0
6 Great shall be

57
05:46:28,0 --> 05:46:28,0
their reward and eternal

58
05:46:28,0 --> 06:12:29,
shall be their glory.

59
06:12:29,0 --> 06:12:29,0
7 And to them will I

60
06:12:29,0 --> 06:12:29,0
reveal all mysteries,

61
06:12:29,0 --> 06:12:29,0
yea, all the hidden

62
06:12:29,0 --> 06:12:29,0
mysteries of my

63
06:12:29,0 --> 06:12:29,0
kingdom from days of old,

64
06:12:29,0 --> 06:12:29,0
and for ages to come,

65
06:12:29,0 --> 06:12:29,0
will I make known

66
06:12:29,0 --> 06:12:29,0
unto them the good

67
06:12:29,0 --> 06:12:29,0
pleasure of my will

68
06:12:29,0 --> 06:12:29,0
concerning all things

69
06:12:29,0 --> 06:19:31,
pertaining to my kingdom.

70
06:19:31,0 --> 06:19:31,0
8 Yea, even the

71
06:19:31,0 --> 06:19:31,0
wonders of eternity shall

72
06:19:31,0 --> 06:19:31,0
they know, and things

73
06:19:31,0 --> 06:19:31,0
to come will I show

74
06:19:31,0 --> 06:19:31,0
them, even the things

75
06:19:31,0 --> 06:20:35,
of many generations.

76
06:20:35,0 --> 06:20:35,0
9 And their wisdom

77
06:20:35,0 --> 06:20:35,0
shall be great, and

78
06:20:35,0 --> 06:20:35,0
their understanding

79
06:20:35,0 --> 06:20:35,0
reach to heaven; and

80
06:20:35,0 --> 06:20:35,0
before them the

81
06:20:35,0 --> 06:20:35,0
wisdom of the wise shall

82
06:20:35,0 --> 06:20:35,0
perish, and the

83
06:20:35,0 --> 06:20:35,0
understanding of the

84
06:20:35,0 --> 06:51:35,
prudent shall come to naught.

85
06:51:35,0 --> 06:51:35,0
10 For by my Spirit

86
06:51:35,0 --> 06:51:35,0
will I enlighten

87
06:51:35,0 --> 06:51:35,0
them, and by my

88
06:51:35,0 --> 06:51:35,0
power will I make known

89
06:51:35,0 --> 06:51:35,0
unto them the

90
06:51:35,0 --> 06:51:35,0
secrets of my will—yea,

91
06:51:35,0 --> 06:51:35,0
even those things

92
06:51:35,0 --> 06:51:35,0
which eye has not

93
06:51:35,0 --> 06:51:35,0
seen, nor ear heard,

94
06:51:35,0 --> 06:51:35,0
nor yet entered

95
06:51:35,0 --> 06:53:39,
into the heart of man.

96
06:53:39,0 --> 06:53:39,0
11 We, Joseph

97
06:53:39,0 --> 06:53:39,0
Smith, Jun., and

98
06:53:39,0 --> 06:53:39,0
Sidney Rigdon, being in

99
06:53:39,0 --> 06:53:39,0
the Spirit on the

100
06:53:39,0 --> 06:53:39,0
sixteenth day of

101
06:53:39,0 --> 06:53:39,0
February, in the

102
06:53:39,0 --> 06:53:39,0
year of our Lord

103
06:53:39,0 --> 06:53:39,0
one thousand eight

104
06:53:39,0 --> 06:49:19,
hundred and thirty-two—

105
06:49:19,0 --> 06:49:19,0
12 By the power

106
06:49:19,0 --> 06:49:19,0
of the Spirit our

107
06:49:19,0 --> 06:49:19,0
eyes were opened

108
06:49:19,0 --> 06:49:19,0
and our

109
06:49:19,0 --> 06:49:19,0
understandings were

110
06:49:19,0 --> 06:49:19,0
enlightened, so as to

111
06:49:19,0 --> 06:49:19,0
see and understand

112
06:49:19,0 --> 06:54:24,
the things of God—

113
06:54:24,0 --> 06:54:24,0
13 Even those

114
06:54:24,0 --> 06:54:24,0
things which were

115
06:54:24,0 --> 06:54:24,0
from the

116
06:54:24,0 --> 06:54:24,0
beginning before the

117
06:54:24,0 --> 06:54:24,0
world was, which

118
06:54:24,0 --> 06:54:24,0
were ordained of

119
06:54:24,0 --> 06:54:24,0
the Father,

120
06:54:24,0 --> 06:54:24,0
through his Only

121
06:54:24,0 --> 06:54:24,0
Begotten Son, who

122
06:54:24,0 --> 06:54:24,0
was in the bosom

123
06:54:24,0 --> 06:54:24,0
of the Father,

124
06:54:24,0 --> 07:15:27,
even from the beginning;

125
07:15:27,0 --> 07:15:27,0
14 Of whom we

126
07:15:27,0 --> 07:15:27,0
bear record; and

127
07:15:27,0 --> 07:15:27,0
the record

128
07:15:27,0 --> 07:15:27,0
which we bear is

129
07:15:27,0 --> 07:15:27,0
the fulness of

130
07:15:27,0 --> 07:15:27,0
the gospel of

131
07:15:27,0 --> 07:15:27,0
Jesus Christ, who

132
07:15:27,0 --> 07:15:27,0
is the Son,

133
07:15:27,0 --> 07:15:27,0
whom we saw and

134
07:15:27,0 --> 07:15:27,0
with whom we

135
07:15:27,0 --> 07:15:27,0
conversed in the

136
07:15:27,0 --> 07:38:28,
heavenly vision.

137
07:38:28,0 --> 07:38:28,0
15 For while we

138
07:38:28,0 --> 07:38:28,0
were doing the

139
07:38:28,0 --> 07:38:28,0
work of

140
07:38:28,0 --> 07:38:28,0
translation, which

141
07:38:28,0 --> 07:38:28,0
the Lord had

142
07:38:28,0 --> 07:38:28,0
appointed unto us,

143
07:38:28,0 --> 07:39:32,
we came to the 

144
07:39:32,0 --> 07:39:32,0
16 Speaking of

145
07:39:32,0 --> 07:39:32,0
the

146
07:39:32,0 --> 07:39:32,0
resurrection of the dead,

147
07:39:32,0 --> 07:39:32,0
concerning

148
07:39:32,0 --> 07:39:32,0
those who shall

149
07:39:32,0 --> 07:39:32,0
hear the voice of

150
07:39:32,0 --> 08:08:33,
the Son of Man:

151
08:08:33,0 --> 08:08:33,0
17 And shall

152
08:08:33,0 --> 08:08:33,0
come forth;

153
08:08:33,0 --> 08:08:33,0
they who have

154
08:08:33,0 --> 08:08:33,0
done good, in the

155
08:08:33,0 --> 08:08:33,0
resurrection

156
08:08:33,0 --> 08:08:33,0
of the just;

157
08:08:33,0 --> 08:08:33,0
and they who

158
08:08:33,0 --> 08:08:33,0
have done evil,

159
08:08:33,0 --> 08:08:33,0
in the

160
08:08:33,0 --> 08:11:07,
resurrection of the unjust.

161
08:11:07,0 --> 08:11:07,0
18 Now this

162
08:11:07,0 --> 08:11:07,0
caused us to

163
08:11:07,0 --> 08:11:07,0
marvel, for

164
08:11:07,0 --> 08:11:07,0
it was

165
08:11:07,0 --> 08:11:07,0
given unto us of

166
08:11:07,0 --> 08:15:44,
the Spirit.

167
08:15:44,0 --> 08:15:44,0
19 And

168
08:15:44,0 --> 08:15:44,0
while we

169
08:15:44,0 --> 08:15:44,0
meditated upon

170
08:15:44,0 --> 08:15:44,0
these things,

171
08:15:44,0 --> 08:15:44,0
the Lord

172
08:15:44,0 --> 08:15:44,0
touched the

173
08:15:44,0 --> 08:15:44,0
eyes of our

174
08:15:44,0 --> 08:15:44,0


175
08:15:44,0 --> 08:15:44,0
understandings and

176
08:15:44,0 --> 08:15:44,0
they were

177
08:15:44,0 --> 08:15:44,0
opened, and

178
08:15:44,0 --> 08:15:44,0
the glory of

179
08:15:44,0 --> 08:15:44,0
the Lord

180
08:15:44,0 --> 08:22:47,
shone round about.

181
08:22:47,0 --> 08:22:47,0
20 And we

182
08:22:47,0 --> 08:22:47,0
beheld the

183
08:22:47,0 --> 08:22:47,0
glory of

184
08:22:47,0 --> 08:22:47,0
the Son,

185
08:22:47,0 --> 08:22:47,0
on the

186
08:22:47,0 --> 08:22:47,0
right hand of

187
08:22:47,0 --> 08:22:47,0
the

188
08:22:47,0 --> 08:22:47,0
Father, and

189
08:22:47,0 --> 08:22:47,0
received of

190
08:22:47,0 --> 08:23:51,
his fulness;

191
08:23:51,0 --> 08:23:51,0
21 And

192
08:23:51,0 --> 08:23:51,0
saw the

193
08:23:51,0 --> 08:23:51,0
holy angels,

194
08:23:51,0 --> 08:23:51,0
and them

195
08:23:51,0 --> 08:23:51,0
who are

196
08:23:51,0 --> 08:23:51,0


197
08:23:51,0 --> 08:23:51,0
sanctified before

198
08:23:51,0 --> 08:23:51,0
his

199
08:23:51,0 --> 08:23:51,0
throne,

200
08:23:51,0 --> 08:23:51,0
worshiping God,

201
08:23:51,0 --> 08:23:51,0
and the

202
08:23:51,0 --> 08:23:51,0
Lamb, who

203
08:23:51,0 --> 08:23:51,0
worship

204
08:23:51,0 --> 08:50:49,
him forever and ever.

205
08:50:49,0 --> 08:50:49,0
22 And

206
08:50:49,0 --> 08:50:49,0
now,

207
08:50:49,0 --> 08:50:49,0
after the

208
08:50:49,0 --> 08:50:49,0
many

209
08:50:49,0 --> 08:50:49,0
testimonies

210
08:50:49,0 --> 08:50:49,0
which

211
08:50:49,0 --> 08:50:49,0
have been

212
08:50:49,0 --> 08:50:49,0
given of

213
08:50:49,0 --> 08:50:49,0
him,

214
08:50:49,0 --> 08:50:49,0
this is the

215
08:50:49,0 --> 08:50:49,0


216
08:50:49,0 --> 08:50:49,0
testimony, last

217
08:50:49,0 --> 08:50:49,0
