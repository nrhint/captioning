1
00:00:11,562 --> 00:00:19,333
Section 76 A vision given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:27,104
 Prophet and Sidney Rigdon, at Hiram, Ohio, February

3
00:00:27,104 --> 00:00:34,875
 16, 1832. Prefacing the record of this vision,

4
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:42,646
 Joseph Smith’s history states: “Upon my return from

5
00:00:42,646 --> 00:00:50,417
 Amherst conference, I resumed the translation of the

6
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:58,188
 Scriptures. From sundry revelations which had been

7
00:00:58,188 --> 00:01:05,959
 received, it was apparent that many important

8
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:13,73
 points touching the salvation of man had been taken

9
00:01:13,73 --> 00:01:21,501
 from the Bible, or lost before it was compiled. It

10
00:01:21,501 --> 00:01:29,272
 appeared self-evident from what truths were left,

11
00:01:29,272 --> 00:01:37,043
 that if God rewarded every one according to the

12
00:01:37,043 --> 00:01:44,814
 deeds done in the body the term ‘Heaven,’ as

13
00:01:44,814 --> 00:01:52,585
 intended for the Saints’ eternal home, must include more

14
00:01:52,585 --> 00:02:00,356
 kingdoms than one. Accordingly, … while

15
00:02:00,356 --> 00:02:08,127
 translating St. John’s Gospel, myself and Elder Rigdon saw

16
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:15,898
 the following vision.” At the time this vision was

17
00:02:15,898 --> 00:02:23,669
 given, the Prophet was translating 
John 5:29.

18
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:31,44
1–4, The Lord is God; 
5–10, The mysteries of the

19
00:02:31,44 --> 00:02:39,211
 kingdom will be revealed to all the faithful;

20
00:02:39,211 --> 00:02:46,982
11–17, All will come forth in the resurrection of the

21
00:02:46,982 --> 00:02:54,753
 just or the unjust; 
18–24, The inhabitants of many

22
00:02:54,753 --> 00:03:02,524
 worlds are begotten sons and daughters unto God

23
00:03:02,524 --> 00:03:10,295
 through the Atonement of Jesus Christ; 
25–29, An

24
00:03:10,295 --> 00:03:18,066
 angel of God fell and became the devil; 
30–49,

25
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:25,837
 Sons of perdition suffer eternal damnation; all

26
00:03:25,837 --> 00:03:33,608
 others gain some degree of salvation; 
50–70, The glory

27
00:03:33,608 --> 00:03:41,379
 and reward of exalted beings in the celestial

28
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:49,15
 kingdom is described; 
71–80, Those who will inherit

29
00:03:49,15 --> 00:03:56,921
 the terrestrial kingdom are described; 
81–113,

30
00:03:56,921 --> 00:04:04,692
 The status of those in the telestial, terrestrial,

31
00:04:04,692 --> 00:04:12,463
 and celestial glories is explained; 
114–19, The

32
00:04:12,463 --> 00:04:20,234
 faithful may see and understand the mysteries of

33
00:04:20,234 --> 00:04:28,005
 God’s kingdom by the power of the Holy Spirit.

34
00:04:28,005 --> 00:04:35,776
twenty-ninth verse of the fifth chapter of John, which

35
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:43,547
 was given unto us as follows

36
00:04:43,467 --> 00:04:51,134
1 Hear, O ye heavens, and give ear, O earth, and

37
00:04:51,134 --> 00:04:58,801
 rejoice ye inhabitants thereof, for the Lord is

38
00:04:58,801 --> 00:05:06,468
 God, and beside him there is no Savior

39
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:14,739
2 Great is his wisdom, marvelous are his ways, and

40
00:05:14,739 --> 00:05:23,239
 the extent of his doings none can find out

41
00:05:23,273 --> 00:05:29,273
3 His purposes fail not, neither are there any who

42
00:05:29,273 --> 00:05:35,273
 can stay his hand

43
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:41,602
4 From eternity to eternity he is the same, and

44
00:05:41,602 --> 00:05:47,602
 his years never fail

45
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:53,914
5 For thus saith the Lord—I, the Lord, am merciful

46
00:05:53,914 --> 00:06:00,414
 and gracious unto those who fear me, and delight

47
00:06:00,414 --> 00:06:06,914
 to honor those who serve me in righteousness and

48
00:06:06,914 --> 00:06:13,414
 in truth unto the end

49
00:06:13,423 --> 00:06:17,923
6 Great shall be their reward and eternal shall be

50
00:06:17,923 --> 00:06:22,423
 their glory

51
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:28,815
7 And to them will I reveal all mysteries, yea,

52
00:06:28,815 --> 00:06:35,415
 all the hidden mysteries of my kingdom from days of

53
00:06:35,415 --> 00:06:42,015
 old, and for ages to come, will I make known unto

54
00:06:42,015 --> 00:06:48,615
 them the good pleasure of my will concerning all

55
00:06:48,615 --> 00:06:55,215
 things pertaining to my kingdom

56
00:06:55,215 --> 00:07:02,548
8 Yea, even the wonders of eternity shall they

57
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:09,881
 know, and things to come will I show them, even the

58
00:07:09,881 --> 00:07:17,214
 things of many generations

59
00:07:17,253 --> 00:07:23,253
9 And their wisdom shall be great, and their

60
00:07:23,253 --> 00:07:29,253
 understanding reach to heaven; and before them the

61
00:07:29,253 --> 00:07:35,253
 wisdom of the wise shall perish, and the understanding

62
00:07:35,253 --> 00:07:41,253
 of the prudent shall come to naught

63
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:47,427
10 For by my Spirit will I enlighten them, and by

64
00:07:47,427 --> 00:07:53,627
 my power will I make known unto them the secrets

65
00:07:53,627 --> 00:07:59,827
 of my will—yea, even those things which eye has not

66
00:07:59,827 --> 00:08:06,027
 seen, nor ear heard, nor yet entered into the

67
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:12,227
 heart of man

68
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:15,458
11 We, Joseph Smith, Jun., and Sidney Rigdon,

69
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:18,708
 being in the Spirit on the sixteenth day of February,

70
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:21,958
 in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred

71
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:25,208
 and thirty-two

72
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:30,905
12 By the power of the Spirit our eyes were opened

73
00:08:30,905 --> 00:08:36,572
 and our understandings were enlightened, so as to

74
00:08:36,572 --> 00:08:42,239
 see and understand the things of God

75
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:47,522
13 Even those things which were from the beginning

76
00:08:47,522 --> 00:08:53,022
 before the world was, which were ordained of the

77
00:08:53,022 --> 00:08:58,522
 Father, through his Only Begotten Son, who was in

78
00:08:58,522 --> 00:09:04,022
 the bosom of the Father, even from the beginning

79
00:09:04,527 --> 00:09:09,527
14 Of whom we bear record; and the record which we

80
00:09:09,527 --> 00:09:14,527
 bear is the fulness of the gospel of Jesus

81
00:09:14,527 --> 00:09:19,527
 Christ, who is the Son, whom we saw and with whom we

82
00:09:19,527 --> 00:09:24,527
 conversed in the heavenly vision

83
00:09:24,047 --> 00:09:29,714
15 For while we were doing the work of

84
00:09:29,714 --> 00:09:35,381
 translation, which the Lord had appointed unto us, we came to

85
00:09:35,381 --> 00:09:41,048
 the

86
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:46,413
16 Speaking of the resurrection of the dead,

87
00:09:46,413 --> 00:09:51,747
 concerning those who shall hear the voice of the Son of

88
00:09:51,747 --> 00:09:57,08
 Man

89
00:09:57,38 --> 00:10:04,38
17 And shall come forth; they who have done good,

90
00:10:04,38 --> 00:10:11,38
 in the resurrection of the just; and they who have

91
00:10:11,38 --> 00:10:18,38
 done evil, in the resurrection of the unjust

92
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:22,384
18 Now this caused us to marvel, for it was given

93
00:10:22,384 --> 00:10:26,384
 unto us of the Spirit

94
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:30,926
19 And while we meditated upon these things, the

95
00:10:30,926 --> 00:10:34,926
 Lord touched the eyes of our understandings and

96
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:38,926
 they were opened, and the glory of the Lord shone

97
00:10:38,926 --> 00:10:42,926
 round about

98
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:46,675
20 And we beheld the glory of the Son, on the

99
00:10:46,675 --> 00:10:50,675
 right hand of the Father, and received of his fulness

100
00:10:50,675 --> 00:10:54,675


101
00:10:54,737 --> 00:11:02,404
21 And saw the holy angels, and them who are

102
00:11:02,404 --> 00:11:10,071
 sanctified before his throne, worshiping God, and the

103
00:11:10,071 --> 00:11:17,738
 Lamb, who worship him forever and ever

104
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:21,243
22 And now, after the many testimonies which have

105
00:11:21,243 --> 00:11:25,243
 been given of him, this is the testimony, last of

106
00:11:25,243 --> 00:11:29,243
 all, which we give of him: That he lives

107
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:34,922
23 For we saw him, even on the right hand of God;

108
00:11:34,922 --> 00:11:40,589
 and we heard the voice bearing record that he is

109
00:11:40,589 --> 00:11:46,256
 the Only Begotten of the Father

110
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:52,939
24 That by him, and through him, and of him, the

111
00:11:52,939 --> 00:11:59,606
 worlds are and were created, and the inhabitants

112
00:11:59,606 --> 00:12:06,273
 thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God

113
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:12,793
25 And this we saw also, and bear record, that an

114
00:12:12,793 --> 00:12:18,793
 angel of God who was in authority in the presence

115
00:12:18,793 --> 00:12:24,793
 of God, who rebelled against the Only Begotten Son

116
00:12:24,793 --> 00:12:30,793
 whom the Father loved and who was in the bosom of

117
00:12:30,793 --> 00:12:36,793
 the Father, was thrust down from the presence of

118
00:12:36,793 --> 00:12:42,793
 God and the Son

119
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:53,262
26 And was called Perdition, for the heavens wept

120
00:12:53,262 --> 00:13:03,762
 over him—he was Lucifer, a son of the morning

121
00:13:03,766 --> 00:13:09,766
27 And we beheld, and lo, he is fallen! is fallen,

122
00:13:09,766 --> 00:13:15,766
 even a son of the morning

123
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:20,478
28 And while we were yet in the Spirit, the Lord

124
00:13:20,478 --> 00:13:25,678
 commanded us that we should write the vision; for

125
00:13:25,678 --> 00:13:30,878
 we beheld Satan, that old serpent, even the devil,

126
00:13:30,878 --> 00:13:36,078
 who rebelled against God, and sought to take the

127
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:41,278
 kingdom of our God and his Christ

128
00:13:41,804 --> 00:13:47,304
29 Wherefore, he maketh war with the saints of

129
00:13:47,304 --> 00:13:52,804
 God, and encompasseth them round about

130
00:13:52,815 --> 00:13:59,148
30 And we saw a vision of the sufferings of those

131
00:13:59,148 --> 00:14:05,481
 with whom he made war and overcame, for thus came

132
00:14:05,481 --> 00:14:11,814
 the voice of the Lord unto us

133
00:14:11,1 --> 00:14:15,1
31 Thus saith the Lord concerning all those who

134
00:14:15,1 --> 00:14:19,1
 know my power, and have been made partakers thereof,

135
00:14:19,1 --> 00:14:23,1
 and suffered themselves through the power of the

136
00:14:23,1 --> 00:14:27,1
 devil to be overcome, and to deny the truth and

137
00:14:27,1 --> 00:14:31,1
 defy my power

138
00:14:31,087 --> 00:14:39,087
32 They are they who are the sons of perdition, of

139
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:47,087
 whom I say that it had been better for them never

140
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:55,087
 to have been born

141
00:14:55,628 --> 00:15:02,628
33 For they are vessels of wrath, doomed to suffer

142
00:15:02,628 --> 00:15:09,628
 the wrath of God, with the devil and his angels

143
00:15:09,628 --> 00:15:16,628
 in eternity

144
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,899
34 Concerning whom I have said there is no

145
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:25,399
 forgiveness in this world nor in the world to come

146
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:31,691
35 Having denied the Holy Spirit after having

147
00:15:31,691 --> 00:15:37,691
 received it, and having denied the Only Begotten Son

148
00:15:37,691 --> 00:15:43,691
 of the Father, having crucified him unto themselves

149
00:15:43,691 --> 00:15:49,691
 and put him to an open shame

150
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:54,715
36 These are they who shall go away into the lake

151
00:15:54,715 --> 00:15:59,715
 of fire and brimstone, with the devil and his

152
00:15:59,715 --> 00:16:04,715
 angels

153
00:16:04,28 --> 00:16:08,78
37 And the only ones on whom the second death

154
00:16:08,78 --> 00:16:13,28
 shall have any power

155
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:18,973
38 Yea, verily, the only ones who shall not be

156
00:16:18,973 --> 00:16:24,64
 redeemed in the due time of the Lord, after the

157
00:16:24,64 --> 00:16:30,307
 sufferings of his wrath

158
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:36,423
39 For all the rest shall be brought forth by the

159
00:16:36,423 --> 00:16:42,023
 resurrection of the dead, through the triumph and

160
00:16:42,023 --> 00:16:47,623
 the glory of the Lamb, who was slain, who was in

161
00:16:47,623 --> 00:16:53,223
 the bosom of the Father before the worlds were

162
00:16:53,223 --> 00:16:58,823
 made

163
00:16:58,801 --> 00:17:03,468
40 And this is the gospel, the glad tidings, which

164
00:17:03,468 --> 00:17:08,135
 the voice out of the heavens bore record unto us

165
00:17:08,135 --> 00:17:12,802


166
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:19,065
41 That he came into the world, even Jesus, to be

167
00:17:19,065 --> 00:17:25,565
 crucified for the world, and to bear the sins of

168
00:17:25,565 --> 00:17:32,065
 the world, and to sanctify the world, and to

169
00:17:32,065 --> 00:17:38,565
 cleanse it from all unrighteousness

170
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:44,558
42 That through him all might be saved whom the

171
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:50,558
 Father had put into his power and made by him

172
00:17:50,553 --> 00:18:00,22
43 Who glorifies the Father, and saves all the

173
00:18:00,22 --> 00:18:09,887
 works of his hands, except those sons of perdition

174
00:18:09,887 --> 00:18:19,554
 who deny the Son after the Father has revealed him

175
00:18:19,815 --> 00:18:27,482
44 Wherefore, he saves all except them—they shall

176
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:35,149
 go away into everlasting punishment, which is

177
00:18:35,149 --> 00:18:42,816
 endless punishment, which is eternal punishment, to

178
00:18:42,816 --> 00:18:50,483
 reign with the devil and his angels in eternity,

179
00:18:50,483 --> 00:18:58,15
 where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not

180
00:18:58,15 --> 00:19:05,817
 quenched, which is their torment

181
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:11,778
45 And the end thereof, neither the place thereof,

182
00:19:11,778 --> 00:19:17,778
 nor their torment, no man knows

183
00:19:17,54 --> 00:19:22,207
46 Neither was it revealed, neither is, neither

184
00:19:22,207 --> 00:19:26,874
 will be revealed unto man, except to them who are

185
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:31,541
 made partakers thereof

186
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:36,803
47 Nevertheless, I, the Lord, show it by vision

187
00:19:36,803 --> 00:19:42,303
 unto many, but straightway shut it up again

188
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:47,331
48 Wherefore, the end, the width, the height, the

189
00:19:47,331 --> 00:19:52,581
 depth, and the misery thereof, they understand

190
00:19:52,581 --> 00:19:57,831
 not, neither any man except those who are ordained

191
00:19:57,831 --> 00:20:03,081
 unto this condemnation

192
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:10,836
49 And we heard the voice, saying: Write the

193
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:17,836
 vision, for lo, this is the end of the vision of the

194
00:20:17,836 --> 00:20:24,836
 sufferings of the ungodly

195
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:28,873
50 And again we bear record—for we saw and heard,

196
00:20:28,873 --> 00:20:33,623
 and this is the testimony of the gospel of Christ

197
00:20:33,623 --> 00:20:38,373
 concerning them who shall come forth in the

198
00:20:38,373 --> 00:20:43,123
 resurrection of the just

199
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:48,076
51 They are they who received the testimony of

200
00:20:48,076 --> 00:20:52,276
 Jesus, and believed on his name and were baptized

201
00:20:52,276 --> 00:20:56,476
 after the manner of his burial, being buried in the

202
00:20:56,476 --> 00:21:00,676
 water in his name, and this according to the

203
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:04,876
 commandment which he has given

204
00:21:04,647 --> 00:21:10,897
52 That by keeping the commandments they might be

205
00:21:10,897 --> 00:21:17,147
 washed and cleansed from all their sins, and

206
00:21:17,147 --> 00:21:23,397
 receive the Holy Spirit by the laying on of the hands

207
00:21:23,397 --> 00:21:29,647
 of him who is ordained and sealed unto this power

208
00:21:29,922 --> 00:21:34,922
53 And who overcome by faith, and are sealed by

209
00:21:34,922 --> 00:21:39,922
 the Holy Spirit of promise, which the Father sheds

210
00:21:39,922 --> 00:21:44,922
 forth upon all those who are just and true

211
00:21:44,203 --> 00:21:47,203
54 They are they who are the church of the

212
00:21:47,203 --> 00:21:50,203
 Firstborn

213
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:54,259
55 They are they into whose hands the Father has

214
00:21:54,259 --> 00:21:57,759
 given all things

215
00:21:57,049 --> 00:22:01,549
56 They are they who are priests and kings, who

216
00:22:01,549 --> 00:22:06,049
 have received of his fulness, and of his glory

217
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:11,326
57 And are priests of the Most High, after the

218
00:22:11,326 --> 00:22:15,826
 order of Melchizedek, which was after the order of

219
00:22:15,826 --> 00:22:20,326
 Enoch, which was after the order of the Only

220
00:22:20,326 --> 00:22:24,826
 Begotten Son

221
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:29,609
58 Wherefore, as it is written, they are gods,

222
00:22:29,609 --> 00:22:35,109
 even the sons of God

223
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:40,137
59 Wherefore, all things are theirs, whether life

224
00:22:40,137 --> 00:22:44,887
 or death, or things present, or things to come,

225
00:22:44,887 --> 00:22:49,637
 all are theirs and they are Christ’s, and Christ is

226
00:22:49,637 --> 00:22:54,387
 God’s

227
00:22:54,39 --> 00:22:59,39
60 And they shall overcome all things

228
00:22:59,178 --> 00:23:06,178
61 Wherefore, let no man glory in man, but rather

229
00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:13,178
 let him glory in God, who shall subdue all enemies

230
00:23:13,178 --> 00:23:20,178
 under his feet

231
00:23:20,182 --> 00:23:24,682
62 These shall dwell in the presence of God and

232
00:23:24,682 --> 00:23:29,182
 his Christ forever and ever

233
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:34,292
63 These are they whom he shall bring with him,

234
00:23:34,292 --> 00:23:38,625
 when he shall come in the clouds of heaven to reign

235
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:42,958
 on the earth over his people

236
00:23:42,972 --> 00:23:45,472
64 These are they who shall have part in the first

237
00:23:45,472 --> 00:23:47,972
 resurrection

238
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:51,009
65 These are they who shall come forth in the

239
00:23:51,009 --> 00:23:54,509
 resurrection of the just

240
00:23:54,283 --> 00:23:58,283
66 These are they who are come unto Mount Zion,

241
00:23:58,283 --> 00:24:02,283
 and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly

242
00:24:02,283 --> 00:24:06,283
 place, the holiest of all

243
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:12,812
67 These are they who have come to an innumerable

244
00:24:12,812 --> 00:24:18,812
 company of angels, to the general assembly and

245
00:24:18,812 --> 00:24:24,812
 church of Enoch, and of the Firstborn

246
00:24:24,813 --> 00:24:30,813
68 These are they whose names are written in

247
00:24:30,813 --> 00:24:36,813
 heaven, where God and Christ are the judge of all

248
00:24:36,325 --> 00:24:40,825
69 These are they who are just men made perfect

249
00:24:40,825 --> 00:24:45,325
 through Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, who

250
00:24:45,325 --> 00:24:49,825
 wrought out this perfect atonement through the

251
00:24:49,825 --> 00:24:54,325
 shedding of his own blood

252
00:24:54,093 --> 00:25:01,093
70 These are they whose bodies are celestial,

253
00:25:01,093 --> 00:25:08,093
 whose glory is that of the sun, even the glory of God,

254
00:25:08,093 --> 00:25:15,093
 the highest of all, whose glory the sun of the

255
00:25:15,093 --> 00:25:22,093
 firmament is written of as being typical

256
00:25:22,071 --> 00:25:28,404
71 And again, we saw the terrestrial world, and

257
00:25:28,404 --> 00:25:34,737
 behold and lo, these are they who are of the

258
00:25:34,737 --> 00:25:41,07
 terrestrial, whose glory differs from that of the church

259
00:25:41,07 --> 00:25:47,403
 of the Firstborn who have received the fulness of

260
00:25:47,403 --> 00:25:53,736
 the Father, even as that of the moon differs from

261
00:25:53,736 --> 00:26:00,069
 the sun in the firmament

262
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:05,325
72 Behold, these are they who died without law

263
00:26:05,848 --> 00:26:10,598
73 And also they who are the spirits of men kept

264
00:26:10,598 --> 00:26:15,348
 in prison, whom the Son visited, and preached the

265
00:26:15,348 --> 00:26:20,098
 gospel unto them, that they might be judged

266
00:26:20,098 --> 00:26:24,848
 according to men in the flesh

267
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:30,149
74 Who received not the testimony of Jesus in the

268
00:26:30,149 --> 00:26:36,149
 flesh, but afterwards received it

269
00:26:36,145 --> 00:26:41,645
75 These are they who are honorable men of the

270
00:26:41,645 --> 00:26:47,145
 earth, who were blinded by the craftiness of men

271
00:26:47,422 --> 00:26:50,922
76 These are they who receive of his glory, but

272
00:26:50,922 --> 00:26:54,422
 not of his fulness

273
00:26:54,696 --> 00:27:00,196
77 These are they who receive of the presence of

274
00:27:00,196 --> 00:27:05,696
 the Son, but not of the fulness of the Father

275
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:11,707
78 Wherefore, they are bodies terrestrial, and not

276
00:27:11,707 --> 00:27:17,707
 bodies celestial, and differ in glory as the moon

277
00:27:17,707 --> 00:27:23,707
 differs from the sun

278
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:27,808
79 These are they who are not valiant in the

279
00:27:27,808 --> 00:27:32,141
 testimony of Jesus; wherefore, they obtain not the

280
00:27:32,141 --> 00:27:36,474
 crown over the kingdom of our God

281
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:41,755
80 And now this is the end of the vision which we

282
00:27:41,755 --> 00:27:46,755
 saw of the terrestrial, that the Lord commanded us

283
00:27:46,755 --> 00:27:51,755
 to write while we were yet in the Spirit

284
00:27:51,27 --> 00:27:56,77
81 And again, we saw the glory of the telestial,

285
00:27:56,77 --> 00:28:02,27
 which glory is that of the lesser, even as the

286
00:28:02,27 --> 00:28:07,77
 glory of the stars differs from that of the glory of

287
00:28:07,77 --> 00:28:13,27
 the moon in the firmament

288
00:28:13,542 --> 00:28:18,042
82 These are they who received not the gospel of

289
00:28:18,042 --> 00:28:22,542
 Christ, neither the testimony of Jesus

290
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:28,834
83 These are they who deny not the Holy Spirit

291
00:28:28,607 --> 00:28:32,607
84 These are they who are thrust down to hell

292
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:37,878
85 These are they who shall not be redeemed from

293
00:28:37,878 --> 00:28:43,128
 the devil until the last resurrection, until the

294
00:28:43,128 --> 00:28:48,378
 Lord, even Christ the Lamb, shall have finished his

295
00:28:48,378 --> 00:28:53,628
 work

296
00:28:53,181 --> 00:28:59,181
86 These are they who receive not of his fulness

297
00:28:59,181 --> 00:29:05,181
 in the eternal world, but of the Holy Spirit

298
00:29:05,181 --> 00:29:11,181
 through the ministration of the terrestrial

299
00:29:11,466 --> 00:29:13,966
87 And the terrestrial through the ministration of

300
00:29:13,966 --> 00:29:16,466
 the celestial

301
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:20,655
88 And also the telestial receive it of the

302
00:29:20,655 --> 00:29:25,054
 administering of angels who are appointed to minister

303
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:29,455
 for them, or who are appointed to be ministering

304
00:29:29,455 --> 00:29:33,854
 spirits for them; for they shall be heirs of

305
00:29:33,854 --> 00:29:38,255
 salvation

306
00:29:38,76 --> 00:29:44,093
89 And thus we saw, in the heavenly vision, the

307
00:29:44,093 --> 00:29:49,426
 glory of the telestial, which surpasses all

308
00:29:49,426 --> 00:29:54,759
 understanding

309
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:57,259
90 And no man knows it except him to whom God has

310
00:29:57,259 --> 00:30:00,259
 revealed it

311
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:05,299
91 And thus we saw the glory of the terrestrial

312
00:30:05,299 --> 00:30:10,049
 which excels in all things the glory of the

313
00:30:10,049 --> 00:30:14,799
 telestial, even in glory, and in power, and in might, and

314
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:19,549
 in dominion

315
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:24,067
92 And thus we saw the glory of the celestial,

316
00:30:24,067 --> 00:30:29,067
 which excels in all things—where God, even the

317
00:30:29,067 --> 00:30:34,067
 Father, reigns upon his throne forever and ever

318
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:40,332
93 Before whose throne all things bow in humble

319
00:30:40,332 --> 00:30:46,332
 reverence, and give him glory forever and ever

320
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:52,094
94 They who dwell in his presence are the church

321
00:30:52,094 --> 00:30:58,094
 of the Firstborn; and they see as they are seen,

322
00:30:58,094 --> 00:31:04,094
 and know as they are known, having received of his

323
00:31:04,094 --> 00:31:10,094
 fulness and of his grace

324
00:31:10,385 --> 00:31:14,885
95 And he makes them equal in power, and in might,

325
00:31:14,885 --> 00:31:19,385
 and in dominion

326
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:22,677
96 And the glory of the celestial is one, even as

327
00:31:22,677 --> 00:31:26,177
 the glory of the sun is one

328
00:31:26,935 --> 00:31:30,435
97 And the glory of the terrestrial is one, even

329
00:31:30,435 --> 00:31:33,935
 as the glory of the moon is one

330
00:31:33,942 --> 00:31:40,942
98 And the glory of the telestial is one, even as

331
00:31:40,942 --> 00:31:47,942
 the glory of the stars is one; for as one star

332
00:31:47,942 --> 00:31:54,942
 differs from another star in glory, even so differs

333
00:31:54,942 --> 00:32:01,942
 one from another in glory in the telestial world

334
00:32:01,703 --> 00:32:09,703
99 For these are they who are of Paul, and of

335
00:32:09,703 --> 00:32:17,703
 Apollos, and of Cephas

336
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:24,952
100 These are they who say they are some of one

337
00:32:24,952 --> 00:32:32,702
 and some of another—some of Christ and some of John,

338
00:32:32,702 --> 00:32:40,452
 and some of Moses, and some of Elias, and some of

339
00:32:40,452 --> 00:32:48,202
 Esaias, and some of Isaiah, and some of Enoch

340
00:32:48,183 --> 00:32:53,183
101 But received not the gospel, neither the

341
00:32:53,183 --> 00:32:58,183
 testimony of Jesus, neither the prophets, neither the

342
00:32:58,183 --> 00:33:03,183
 everlasting covenant

343
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:07,681
102 Last of all, these all are they who will not

344
00:33:07,681 --> 00:33:12,181
 be gathered with the saints, to be caught up unto

345
00:33:12,181 --> 00:33:16,681
 the church of the Firstborn, and received into the

346
00:33:16,681 --> 00:33:21,181
 cloud

347
00:33:21,95 --> 00:33:26,95
103 These are they who are liars, and sorcerers,

348
00:33:26,95 --> 00:33:31,95
 and adulterers, and whoremongers, and whosoever

349
00:33:31,95 --> 00:33:36,95
 loves and makes a lie

350
00:33:36,715 --> 00:33:40,215
104 These are they who suffer the wrath of God on

351
00:33:40,215 --> 00:33:43,715
 earth

352
00:33:43,004 --> 00:33:46,504
105 These are they who suffer the vengeance of

353
00:33:46,504 --> 00:33:50,004
 eternal fire

354
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:56,362
106 These are they who are cast down to hell and

355
00:33:56,362 --> 00:34:01,962
 suffer the wrath of Almighty God, until the fulness

356
00:34:01,962 --> 00:34:07,562
 of times, when Christ shall have subdued all

357
00:34:07,562 --> 00:34:13,162
 enemies under his feet, and shall have perfected his

358
00:34:13,162 --> 00:34:18,762
 work

359
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:24,256
107 When he shall deliver up the kingdom, and

360
00:34:24,256 --> 00:34:30,256
 present it unto the Father, spotless, saying: I have

361
00:34:30,256 --> 00:34:36,256
 overcome and have trodden the wine-press alone,

362
00:34:36,256 --> 00:34:42,256
 even the wine-press of the fierceness of the wrath of

363
00:34:42,256 --> 00:34:48,256
 Almighty God

364
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:51,67
108 Then shall he be crowned with the crown of his

365
00:34:51,67 --> 00:34:55,337
 glory, to sit on the throne of his power to reign

366
00:34:55,337 --> 00:34:59,004
 forever and ever

367
00:34:59,998 --> 00:35:07,998
109 But behold, and lo, we saw the glory and the

368
00:35:07,998 --> 00:35:15,998
 inhabitants of the telestial world, that they were

369
00:35:15,998 --> 00:35:23,998
 as innumerable as the stars in the firmament of

370
00:35:23,998 --> 00:35:31,998
 heaven, or as the sand upon the seashore

371
00:35:31,479 --> 00:35:35,729
110 And heard the voice of the Lord saying: These

372
00:35:35,729 --> 00:35:39,979
 all shall bow the knee, and every tongue shall

373
00:35:39,979 --> 00:35:44,229
 confess to him who sits upon the throne forever and

374
00:35:44,229 --> 00:35:48,479
 ever

375
00:35:48,263 --> 00:35:53,013
111 For they shall be judged according to their

376
00:35:53,013 --> 00:35:57,763
 works, and every man shall receive according to his

377
00:35:57,763 --> 00:36:02,513
 own works, his own dominion, in the mansions which

378
00:36:02,513 --> 00:36:07,263
 are prepared

379
00:36:07,766 --> 00:36:13,766
112 And they shall be servants of the Most High;

380
00:36:13,766 --> 00:36:19,766
 but where God and Christ dwell they cannot come,

381
00:36:19,766 --> 00:36:25,766
 worlds without end

382
00:36:25,533 --> 00:36:29,866
113 This is the end of the vision which we saw,

383
00:36:29,866 --> 00:36:34,199
 which we were commanded to write while we were yet

384
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:38,532
 in the Spirit

385
00:36:38,063 --> 00:36:44,563
114 But great and marvelous are the works of the

386
00:36:44,563 --> 00:36:51,063
 Lord, and the mysteries of his kingdom which he

387
00:36:51,063 --> 00:36:57,563
 showed unto us, which surpass all understanding in

388
00:36:57,563 --> 00:37:04,063
 glory, and in might, and in dominion

389
00:37:04,339 --> 00:37:08,339
115 Which he commanded us we should not write

390
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:12,339
 while we were yet in the Spirit, and are not lawful

391
00:37:12,339 --> 00:37:16,339
 for man to utter

392
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:22,084
116 Neither is man capable to make them known, for

393
00:37:22,084 --> 00:37:27,834
 they are only to be seen and understood by the

394
00:37:27,834 --> 00:37:33,584
 power of the Holy Spirit, which God bestows on those

395
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:39,334
 who love him, and purify themselves before him

396
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:43,091
117 To whom he grants this privilege of seeing and

397
00:37:43,091 --> 00:37:46,591
 knowing for themselves

398
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:52,598
118 That through the power and manifestation of

399
00:37:52,598 --> 00:37:58,598
 the Spirit, while in the flesh, they may be able to

400
00:37:58,598 --> 00:38:04,598
 bear his presence in the world of glory

401
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:10,115
119 And to God and the Lamb be glory, and honor,

402
00:38:10,115 --> 00:38:16,115
 and dominion forever and ever. Amen.
