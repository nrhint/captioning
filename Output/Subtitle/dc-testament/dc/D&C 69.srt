00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Prophet, at Hiram, Ohio, November 11, 1831.

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
The compilation of revelations intended for

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
early publication had been passed upon at the

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
special conference of November 1–2. On November 3,

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the revelation herein appearing as 
section 133,

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
later called the Appendix, was added. Oliver

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Cowdery had previously been appointed to carry the

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
manuscript of the compiled revelations and

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
commandments to Independence, Missouri, for printing.

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
He was also to take with him money that had been

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
contributed for the building up of the Church

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
in Missouri. This revelation instructs John

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Whitmer to accompany Oliver Cowdery and also directs

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Whitmer to travel and collect historical

16
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
material in his calling as Church historian and

17
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
recorder. 
1–2, John Whitmer is to accompany Oliver

18
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Cowdery to Missouri; 
3–8, He is also to preach and

19
00:00:00,0 --> 02:19:22,
to collect, record, and write historical data. 

20
02:19:22,0 --> 02:19:22,0
1 Hearken unto me, saith the Lord your God,

21
02:19:22,0 --> 02:19:22,0
for my servant Oliver Cowdery’s sake. It is

22
02:19:22,0 --> 02:19:22,0
not wisdom in me that he should be entrusted

23
02:19:22,0 --> 02:19:22,0
with the commandments and the moneys which

24
02:19:22,0 --> 02:19:22,0
he shall carry unto the land of Zion, except

25
02:19:22,0 --> 02:54:19,
one go with him who will be true and faithful.

26
02:54:19,0 --> 02:54:19,0
2 Wherefore, I, the Lord, will

27
02:54:19,0 --> 02:54:19,0
that my servant, John Whitmer, should

28
02:54:19,0 --> 02:59:24,
go with my servant Oliver Cowdery;

29
02:59:24,0 --> 02:59:24,0
3 And also that he shall

30
02:59:24,0 --> 02:59:24,0
continue in writing and making a

31
02:59:24,0 --> 02:59:24,0
history of all the important

32
02:59:24,0 --> 02:59:24,0
things which he shall observe

33
02:59:24,0 --> 03:14:26,
and know concerning my church;

34
03:14:26,0 --> 03:14:26,0
4 And also that he

35
03:14:26,0 --> 03:14:26,0
receive counsel and

36
03:14:26,0 --> 03:14:26,0
assistance from my servant

37
03:14:26,0 --> 03:15:30,
Oliver Cowdery and others.

38
03:15:30,0 --> 03:15:30,0
5 And also, my

39
03:15:30,0 --> 03:15:30,0
servants who are abroad

40
03:15:30,0 --> 03:15:30,0
in the earth should

41
03:15:30,0 --> 03:15:30,0
send forth the

42
03:15:30,0 --> 03:15:30,0
accounts of their

43
03:15:30,0 --> 03:35:07,
stewardships to the land of Zion;

44
03:35:07,0 --> 03:35:07,0
6 For the land of

45
03:35:07,0 --> 03:35:07,0
Zion shall be a

46
03:35:07,0 --> 03:35:07,0
seat and a place

47
03:35:07,0 --> 03:35:07,0
to receive and do

48
03:35:07,0 --> 03:46:45,
all these things.

49
03:46:45,0 --> 03:46:45,0
7 Nevertheless,

50
03:46:45,0 --> 03:46:45,0
let my servant

51
03:46:45,0 --> 03:46:45,0
John Whitmer

52
03:46:45,0 --> 03:46:45,0
travel many

53
03:46:45,0 --> 03:46:45,0
times from place to

54
03:46:45,0 --> 03:46:45,0
place, and

55
03:46:45,0 --> 03:46:45,0
from church to

56
03:46:45,0 --> 03:46:45,0
church, that he

57
03:46:45,0 --> 03:46:45,0
may the more

58
03:46:45,0 --> 04:03:47,
easily obtain knowledge—

59
04:03:47,0 --> 04:03:47,0
8 Preaching

60
04:03:47,0 --> 04:03:47,0
and expounding,

61
04:03:47,0 --> 04:03:47,0
writing,

62
04:03:47,0 --> 04:03:47,0
copying, selecting,

63
04:03:47,0 --> 04:03:47,0
and obtaining

64
04:03:47,0 --> 04:03:47,0
all things

65
04:03:47,0 --> 04:03:47,0
which shall be

66
04:03:47,0 --> 04:03:47,0
for the good of

67
04:03:47,0 --> 04:03:47,0
the church,

68
04:03:47,0 --> 04:03:47,0
and for the

69
04:03:47,0 --> 04:03:47,0
rising

70
04:03:47,0 --> 04:03:47,0
generations that shall

71
04:03:47,0 --> 04:03:47,0
grow up on the

72
04:03:47,0 --> 04:03:47,0
land of Zion,

73
04:03:47,0 --> 04:03:47,0
to possess it

74
04:03:47,0 --> 04:03:47,0
from

75
04:03:47,0 --> 04:03:47,0
generation to

76
04:03:47,0 --> 04:17:51,
generation, forever and ever. Amen.
