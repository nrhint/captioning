00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:18,067
Section 69 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:18,067 --> 00:00:24,856
 the Prophet, at Hiram, Ohio, November 11, 1831. The

3
00:00:24,856 --> 00:00:31,645
 compilation of revelations intended for early

4
00:00:31,645 --> 00:00:38,434
 publication had been passed upon at the special

5
00:00:38,434 --> 00:00:45,223
 conference of November 1–2. On November 3, the

6
00:00:45,223 --> 00:00:52,012
 revelation herein appearing as 
section 133, later called

7
00:00:52,012 --> 00:00:58,801
 the Appendix, was added. Oliver Cowdery had

8
00:00:58,801 --> 00:01:05,59
 previously been appointed to carry the manuscript of the

9
00:01:05,59 --> 00:01:12,379
 compiled revelations and commandments to

10
00:01:12,379 --> 00:01:19,168
 Independence, Missouri, for printing. He was also to take

11
00:01:19,168 --> 00:01:25,957
 with him money that had been contributed for the

12
00:01:25,957 --> 00:01:32,746
 building up of the Church in Missouri. This

13
00:01:32,746 --> 00:01:39,535
 revelation instructs John Whitmer to accompany Oliver

14
00:01:39,535 --> 00:01:46,324
 Cowdery and also directs Whitmer to travel and

15
00:01:46,324 --> 00:01:53,113
 collect historical material in his calling as Church

16
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:59,902
 historian and recorder. 
1–2, John Whitmer is to

17
00:01:59,902 --> 00:02:06,691
 accompany Oliver Cowdery to Missouri; 
3–8, He is also

18
00:02:06,691 --> 00:02:13,48
 to preach and to collect, record, and write

19
00:02:13,48 --> 00:02:20,269
 historical data.

20
00:02:20,157 --> 00:02:26,657
1 Hearken unto me, saith the Lord your God, for my

21
00:02:26,657 --> 00:02:33,157
 servant Oliver Cowdery’s sake. It is not wisdom

22
00:02:33,157 --> 00:02:39,657
 in me that he should be entrusted with the

23
00:02:39,657 --> 00:02:46,157
 commandments and the moneys which he shall carry unto the

24
00:02:46,157 --> 00:02:52,657
 land of Zion, except one go with him who will be

25
00:02:52,657 --> 00:02:59,157
 true and faithful

26
00:02:59,88 --> 00:03:05,547
2 Wherefore, I, the Lord, will that my servant,

27
00:03:05,547 --> 00:03:11,214
 John Whitmer, should go with my servant Oliver

28
00:03:11,214 --> 00:03:16,881
 Cowdery

29
00:03:16,913 --> 00:03:23,246
3 And also that he shall continue in writing and

30
00:03:23,246 --> 00:03:29,579
 making a history of all the important things which

31
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:35,912
 he shall observe and know concerning my church

32
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:41,465
4 And also that he receive counsel and assistance

33
00:03:41,465 --> 00:03:47,465
 from my servant Oliver Cowdery and others

34
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:53,477
5 And also, my servants who are abroad in the

35
00:03:53,477 --> 00:03:59,477
 earth should send forth the accounts of their

36
00:03:59,477 --> 00:04:05,477
 stewardships to the land of Zion

37
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:11,745
6 For the land of Zion shall be a seat and a place

38
00:04:11,745 --> 00:04:18,245
 to receive and do all these things

39
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:24,009
7 Nevertheless, let my servant John Whitmer travel

40
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:29,259
 many times from place to place, and from church

41
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:34,509
 to church, that he may the more easily obtain

42
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:39,759
 knowledge

43
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:43,312
8 Preaching and expounding, writing, copying,

44
00:04:43,312 --> 00:04:47,312
 selecting, and obtaining all things which shall be for

45
00:04:47,312 --> 00:04:51,312
 the good of the church, and for the rising

46
00:04:51,312 --> 00:04:55,312
 generations that shall grow up on the land of Zion, to

47
00:04:55,312 --> 00:04:59,312
 possess it from generation to generation, forever

48
00:04:59,312 --> 00:05:03,312
 and ever. Amen.
