8
00:57:06,0 --> 00:57:06,0
2 Verily, thus saith the Lord, I say

9
00:57:06,0 --> 00:57:06,0
unto you, if those who call

10
00:57:06,0 --> 00:57:06,0
themselves by my name and are essaying to

11
00:57:06,0 --> 00:57:06,0
be my saints, if they will do my will

12
00:57:06,0 --> 00:57:06,0
and keep my commandments concerning

13
00:57:06,0 --> 00:57:06,0
them, let them gather themselves

14
00:57:06,0 --> 00:57:06,0
together unto the places which I shall

15
00:57:06,0 --> 00:57:06,0
appoint unto them by my servant

16
00:57:06,0 --> 00:57:06,0
Joseph, and build up cities unto my

17
00:57:06,0 --> 00:57:06,0
name, that they may be prepared for

18
00:57:06,0 --> 00:59:40,
that which is in store for a time to come.

20
00:59:40,0 --> 00:59:40,0
my name upon the land opposite

21
00:59:40,0 --> 00:59:40,0
the city of Nauvoo, and let the

22
00:59:40,0 --> 01:26:38,
name of Zarahemla be named upon it.

23
01:26:38,0 --> 01:26:38,0

24
01:26:38,0 --> 01:26:38,0
from the east, and the west, and

25
01:26:38,0 --> 01:26:38,0
the north, and the south, that

26
01:26:38,0 --> 01:26:38,0
have desires to dwell therein, take

27
01:26:38,0 --> 01:26:38,0
up their inheritance in the

Nauvoo, and in all the stakes which I

31
01:26:38,0 --> 01:52:39,
have appointed, saith the Lord.
