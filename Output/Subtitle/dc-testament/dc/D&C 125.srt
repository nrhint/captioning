00:00:17,6 --> 00:00:26,4
 concerning the Saints in the territory of Iowa. 
1â€“4,

4
00:00:26,4 --> 00:00:35,2
 The Saints are to build cities and to gather to

5
00:00:35,2 --> 00:00:44,0

00:00:44,494 --> 00:00:51,494

7
00:00:51,494 --> 00:00:58,494
 saints in the Territory of Iowa

8
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:03,383
2 Verily, thus saith the Lord, I say unto you, if

9
00:01:03,383 --> 00:01:08,508
 those who call themselves by my name and are

10
00:01:08,508 --> 00:01:13,633
 essaying to be my saints, if they will do my will and

11
00:01:13,633 --> 00:01:18,758
 keep my commandments concerning them, let them

12
00:01:18,758 --> 00:01:23,883
 gather themselves together unto the places which I

13
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:29,008
 shall appoint unto them by my servant Joseph, and

14
00:01:29,008 --> 00:01:34,133
 build up cities unto my name, that they may be

15
00:01:34,133 --> 00:01:39,258
 prepared for that which is in store for a time to come

16
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:44,516
3 Let them build up a city unto my name upon the

17
00:01:44,516 --> 00:01:49,516
 land opposite the city of Nauvoo, and let the name

18
00:01:49,516 --> 00:01:54,516
 of Zarahemla be named upon it

19
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:59,847
4 And let all those who come from the east, and

20
00:01:59,847 --> 00:02:05,18
 the west, and the north, and the south, that have

21
00:02:05,18 --> 00:02:10,513
 desires to dwell therein, take up their inheritance

22
00:02:10,513 --> 00:02:15,846
 in the same, as well as in the city of Nashville,

23
00:02:15,846 --> 00:02:21,179
 or in the city of Nauvoo, and in all the stakes

24
00:02:21,179 --> 00:02:26,512
 which I have appointed, saith the Lord.
