17
00:01:41,663 --> 00:01:47,31


18
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:52,441
1 Behold, thus saith the Lord unto the elders whom

19
00:01:52,441 --> 00:01:57,441
 he hath called and chosen in these last days, by

20
00:01:57,441 --> 00:02:02,441
 the voice of his Spirit

21
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:07,689
2 Saying: I, the Lord, will make known unto you

22
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:13,189
 what I will that ye shall do from this time until

23
00:02:13,189 --> 00:02:18,689
 the next conference, which shall be held in

24
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:24,189
 Missouri, upon the land which I will consecrate unto my

25
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:29,689
 people, which are a remnant of Jacob, and those who

26
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:35,189
 are heirs according to the covenant

27
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:39,456
3 Wherefore, verily I say unto you, let my

28
00:02:39,456 --> 00:02:43,256
 servants Joseph Smith, Jun., and Sidney Rigdon take their

29
00:02:43,256 --> 00:02:47,056
 journey as soon as preparations can be made to

30
00:02:47,056 --> 00:02:50,856
 leave their homes, and journey to the land of

31
00:02:50,856 --> 00:02:54,656
 Missouri

32
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:58,408
4 And inasmuch as they are faithful unto me, it

33
00:02:58,408 --> 00:03:02,408
 shall be made known unto them what they shall do

34
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:05,416
5 And it shall also, inasmuch as they are

35
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:08,083
 faithful, be made known unto them the land of your

36
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:10,75
 inheritance

37
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:14,023
6 And inasmuch as they are not faithful, they

38
00:03:14,023 --> 00:03:18,023
 shall be cut off, even as I will, as seemeth me good

39
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:22,931
7 And again, verily I say unto you, let my servant

40
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:27,264
 Lyman Wight and my servant John Corrill take

41
00:03:27,264 --> 00:03:31,597
 their journey speedily

42
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:37,878
8 And also my servant John Murdock, and my servant

43
00:03:37,878 --> 00:03:43,878
 Hyrum Smith, take their journey unto the same

44
00:03:43,878 --> 00:03:49,878
 place by the way of Detroit

45
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:55,796
9 And let them journey from thence preaching the

46
00:03:55,796 --> 00:04:02,196
 word by the way, saying none other things than that

47
00:04:02,196 --> 00:04:08,596
 which the prophets and apostles have written, and

48
00:04:08,596 --> 00:04:14,996
 that which is taught them by the Comforter

49
00:04:14,996 --> 00:04:21,396
 through the prayer of faith

50
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:26,895
10 Let them go two by two, and thus let them

51
00:04:26,895 --> 00:04:31,895
 preach by the way in every congregation, baptizing by

52
00:04:31,895 --> 00:04:36,895
 water, and the laying on of the hands by the

53
00:04:36,895 --> 00:04:41,895
 water’s side

54
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:48,615
11 For thus saith the Lord, I will cut my work

55
00:04:48,615 --> 00:04:55,615
 short in righteousness, for the days come that I will

56
00:04:55,615 --> 00:05:02,615
 send forth judgment unto victory

57
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:09,902
12 And let my servant Lyman Wight beware, for

58
00:05:09,902 --> 00:05:17,402
 Satan desireth to sift him as chaff

59
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:20,884
13 And behold, he that is faithful shall be made

60
00:05:20,884 --> 00:05:24,384
 ruler over many things

61
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:30,158
14 And again, I will give unto you a pattern in

62
00:05:30,158 --> 00:05:35,658
 all things, that ye may not be deceived; for Satan

63
00:05:35,658 --> 00:05:41,158
 is abroad in the land, and he goeth forth deceiving

64
00:05:41,158 --> 00:05:46,658
 the nations

65
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:51,58
15 Wherefore he that prayeth, whose spirit is

66
00:05:51,58 --> 00:05:56,247
 contrite, the same is accepted of me if he obey mine

67
00:05:56,247 --> 00:06:00,914
 ordinances

68
00:06:00,66 --> 00:06:06,993
16 He that speaketh, whose spirit is contrite,

69
00:06:06,993 --> 00:06:13,326
 whose language is meek and edifieth, the same is of

70
00:06:13,326 --> 00:06:19,659
 God if he obey mine ordinances

71
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:24,429
17 And again, he that trembleth under my power

72
00:06:24,429 --> 00:06:29,679
 shall be made strong, and shall bring forth fruits of

73
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:34,929
 praise and wisdom, according to the revelations

74
00:06:34,929 --> 00:06:40,179
 and truths which I have given you

75
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:45,901
18 And again, he that is overcome and bringeth not

76
00:06:45,901 --> 00:06:50,901
 forth fruits, even according to this pattern, is

77
00:06:50,901 --> 00:06:55,901
 not of me

78
00:06:55,181 --> 00:07:00,681
19 Wherefore, by this pattern ye shall know the

79
00:07:00,681 --> 00:07:06,181
 spirits in all cases under the whole heavens

80
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:12,226
20 And the days have come; according to men’s

81
00:07:12,226 --> 00:07:17,726
 faith it shall be done unto them

82
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:22,537
21 Behold, this commandment is given unto all the

83
00:07:22,537 --> 00:07:28,037
 elders whom I have chosen

84
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:32,831
22 And again, verily I say unto you, let my

85
00:07:32,831 --> 00:07:37,581
 servant Thomas B. Marsh and my servant Ezra Thayre take

86
00:07:37,581 --> 00:07:42,331
 their journey also, preaching the word by the way

87
00:07:42,331 --> 00:07:47,081
 unto this same land

88
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:53,468
23 And again, let my servant Isaac Morley and my

89
00:07:53,468 --> 00:07:59,135
 servant Ezra Booth take their journey, also

90
00:07:59,135 --> 00:08:04,802
 preaching the word by the way unto this same land

91
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:10,117
24 And again, let my servants Edward Partridge and

92
00:08:10,117 --> 00:08:16,117
 Martin Harris take their journey with my servants

93
00:08:16,117 --> 00:08:22,117
 Sidney Rigdon and Joseph Smith, Jun

94
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:27,501
25 Let my servants David Whitmer and Harvey

95
00:08:27,501 --> 00:08:32,834
 Whitlock also take their journey, and preach by the way

96
00:08:32,834 --> 00:08:38,167
 unto this same land

97
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:43,617
26 And let my servants Parley P. Pratt and Orson

98
00:08:43,617 --> 00:08:48,95
 Pratt take their journey, and preach by the way,

99
00:08:48,95 --> 00:08:54,283
 even unto this same land

100
00:08:54,634 --> 00:09:00,301
27 And let my servants Solomon Hancock and Simeon

101
00:09:00,301 --> 00:09:05,968
 Carter also take their journey unto this same

102
00:09:05,968 --> 00:09:11,635
 land, and preach by the way

103
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:16,418
28 Let my servants Edson Fuller and Jacob Scott

104
00:09:16,418 --> 00:09:21,418
 also take their journey

105
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:27,428
29 Let my servants Levi W. Hancock and Zebedee

106
00:09:27,428 --> 00:09:33,428
 Coltrin also take their journey

107
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:38,673
30 Let my servants Reynolds Cahoon and Samuel H.

108
00:09:38,673 --> 00:09:44,173
 Smith also take their journey

109
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:49,717
31 Let my servants Wheeler Baldwin and William

110
00:09:49,717 --> 00:09:55,217
 Carter also take their journey

111
00:09:55,061 --> 00:10:00,394
32 And let my servants Newel Knight and Selah J.

112
00:10:00,394 --> 00:10:05,727
 Griffin both be ordained, and also take their

113
00:10:05,727 --> 00:10:11,06
 journey

114
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:19,345
33 Yea, verily I say, let all these take their

115
00:10:19,345 --> 00:10:26,845
 journey unto one place, in their several courses, and

116
00:10:26,845 --> 00:10:34,345
 one man shall not build upon another’s

117
00:10:34,345 --> 00:10:41,845
 foundation, neither journey in another’s track

118
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:45,574
34 He that is faithful, the same shall be kept and

119
00:10:45,574 --> 00:10:50,074
 blessed with much fruit

120
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:54,783
35 And again, I say unto you, let my servants

121
00:10:54,783 --> 00:10:59,45
 Joseph Wakefield and Solomon Humphrey take their

122
00:10:59,45 --> 00:11:04,117
 journey into the eastern lands

123
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:13,864
36 Let them labor with their families, declaring

124
00:11:13,864 --> 00:11:22,864
 none other things than the prophets and apostles,

125
00:11:22,864 --> 00:11:31,864
 that which they have seen and heard and most

126
00:11:31,864 --> 00:11:40,864
 assuredly believe, that the prophecies may be fulfilled

127
00:11:40,864 --> 00:11:49,864


128
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:50,142
37 In consequence of transgression, let that which

129
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:50,475
 was bestowed upon Heman Basset be taken from him,

130
00:11:50,475 --> 00:11:50,808
 and placed upon the head of Simonds Ryder

131
00:11:50,21 --> 00:11:54,877
38 And again, verily I say unto you, let Jared

132
00:11:54,877 --> 00:11:59,543
 Carter be ordained a priest, and also George James be

133
00:11:59,543 --> 00:12:04,211
 ordained a priest

134
00:12:04,49 --> 00:12:08,69
39 Let the residue of the elders watch over the

135
00:12:08,69 --> 00:12:12,89
 churches, and declare the word in the regions round

136
00:12:12,89 --> 00:12:17,09
 about them; and let them labor with their own

137
00:12:17,09 --> 00:12:21,29
 hands that there be no idolatry nor wickedness

138
00:12:21,29 --> 00:12:25,49
 practiced

139
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:31,745
40 And remember in all things the poor and the

140
00:12:31,745 --> 00:12:37,745
 needy, the sick and the afflicted, for he that doeth

141
00:12:37,745 --> 00:12:43,745
 not these things, the same is not my disciple

142
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:50,246
41 And again, let my servants Joseph Smith, Jun.,

143
00:12:50,246 --> 00:12:56,996
 and Sidney Rigdon and Edward Partridge take with

144
00:12:56,996 --> 00:13:03,746
 them a recommend from the church. And let there be

145
00:13:03,746 --> 00:13:10,496
 one obtained for my servant Oliver Cowdery also

146
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:14,456
42 And thus, even as I have said, if ye are

147
00:13:14,456 --> 00:13:18,456
 faithful ye shall assemble yourselves together to

148
00:13:18,456 --> 00:13:22,456
 rejoice upon the land of Missouri, which is the land of

149
00:13:22,456 --> 00:13:26,456
 your inheritance, which is now the land of your

150
00:13:26,456 --> 00:13:30,456
 enemies

151
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:35,743
43 But, behold, I, the Lord, will hasten the city

152
00:13:35,743 --> 00:13:40,743
 in its time, and will crown the faithful with joy

153
00:13:40,743 --> 00:13:45,743
 and with rejoicing

154
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:50,725
44 Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and

155
00:13:50,725 --> 00:13:55,725
 I will lift them up at the last day. Even so.

156
00:13:55,725 --> 00:14:00,725
 Amen.
