1 Behold, thus saith the Lord unto the

18

elders whom he hath called and chosen in

19
00:52:59,0 --> 01:00:43,

2 Saying: I, the Lord, will make known

21
01:00:43,0 --> 01:00:43,0
unto you what I will that ye shall do

22
01:00:43,0 --> 01:00:43,0

25
01:00:43,0 --> 01:00:43,0
people, which are a remnant of Jacob, and

26
01:00:43,0 --> 01:11:50,
those who are heirs according to the covenant.

27
01:11:50,0 --> 01:11:50,0
3 Wherefore, verily I say unto

28
01:11:50,0 --> 01:11:50,0
you, let my servants Joseph Smith,

29
01:11:50,0 --> 01:11:50,0
Jun., and Sidney Rigdon take

30
01:11:50,0 --> 01:11:50,0
their journey as soon as preparations

31
01:11:50,0 --> 01:11:50,0
can be made to leave their

32
01:11:50,0 --> 01:17:01,
homes, and journey to the land of Missouri.

33
01:17:01,0 --> 01:17:01,0
4 And inasmuch as they are

34
01:17:01,0 --> 01:17:01,0
faithful unto me, it shall be made

35
01:17:01,0 --> 01:26:11,
known unto them what they shall do;

36
01:26:11,0 --> 01:26:11,0
5 And it shall also,

37
01:26:11,0 --> 01:26:11,0
inasmuch as they are faithful,

38
01:26:11,0 --> 01:26:11,0
be made known unto them

39
01:26:11,0 --> 01:30:54,
the land of your inheritance.

40
01:30:54,0 --> 01:30:54,0
6 And inasmuch as they

41
01:30:54,0 --> 01:30:54,0
are not faithful, they

42
01:30:54,0 --> 01:30:54,0
shall be cut off, even as

43
01:30:54,0 --> 01:34:39,
I will, as seemeth me good.

44
01:34:39,0 --> 01:34:39,0
7 And again, verily I

45
01:34:39,0 --> 01:34:39,0
say unto you, let my

49
01:38:52,0 --> 01:38:52,0
8 And also my

50
01:38:52,0 --> 01:38:52,0
servant John Murdock, and

51
01:38:52,0 --> 01:38:52,0
my servant Hyrum

52
01:38:52,0 --> 01:38:52,0

53
01:38:52,0 --> 01:38:52,0
journey unto the same

54
01:38:52,0 --> 01:44:21,
place by the way of Detroit.

55
01:44:21,0 --> 01:44:21,0
9 And let them

56
01:44:21,0 --> 01:44:21,0
journey from thence

57
01:44:21,0 --> 01:44:21,0
preaching the word

58
01:44:21,0 --> 01:44:21,0
by the way, saying

59
01:44:21,0 --> 01:44:21,0
none other things

60
01:44:21,0 --> 01:44:21,0
than that which

61
01:44:21,0 --> 01:44:21,0
the prophets and

62
01:44:21,0 --> 01:44:21,0
apostles have

63
01:44:21,0 --> 01:44:21,0
written, and that which

64
01:44:21,0 --> 01:44:21,0
is taught them by

65
01:44:21,0 --> 01:44:21,0
the Comforter

66
01:44:21,0 --> 01:46:33,
through the prayer of faith.

67
01:46:33,0 --> 01:46:33,0
10 Let them go

68
01:46:33,0 --> 01:46:33,0
two by two, and

69
01:46:33,0 --> 01:46:33,0
thus let them preach

70
01:46:33,0 --> 01:46:33,0
by the way in

71
01:46:33,0 --> 01:46:33,0
every congregation,

72
01:46:33,0 --> 01:46:33,0
baptizing by

73
01:46:33,0 --> 01:46:33,0
water, and the

74
01:46:33,0 --> 01:46:33,0
laying on of the hands

75
01:46:33,0 --> 01:54:03,
by the water’s side.

76
01:54:03,0 --> 01:54:03,0
11 For thus

77
01:54:03,0 --> 01:54:03,0
saith the Lord, I

78
01:54:03,0 --> 01:54:03,0
will cut my work

79
01:54:03,0 --> 01:54:03,0
short in

80
01:54:03,0 --> 01:54:03,0
righteousness, for the

81
01:54:03,0 --> 01:54:03,0
days come that I

82
01:54:03,0 --> 01:54:03,0
will send forth

83
01:54:03,0 --> 02:04:42,
judgment unto victory.

84
02:04:42,0 --> 02:04:42,0
12 And let my

85
02:04:42,0 --> 02:04:42,0
servant

86
02:04:42,0 --> 02:04:42,0
Lyman Wight

87
02:04:42,0 --> 02:04:42,0
beware, for Satan

88
02:04:42,0 --> 02:04:42,0
desireth to

89
02:04:42,0 --> 02:09:53,
sift him as chaff.

90
02:09:53,0 --> 02:09:53,0
13 And

91
02:09:53,0 --> 02:09:53,0
behold, he that

92
02:09:53,0 --> 02:09:53,0
is faithful

93
02:09:53,0 --> 02:09:53,0
shall be made

94
02:09:53,0 --> 02:09:53,0
ruler over

95
02:09:53,0 --> 02:20:03,
many things.

96
02:20:03,0 --> 02:20:03,0
14 And

97
02:20:03,0 --> 02:20:03,0
again, I will

98
02:20:03,0 --> 02:20:03,0
give unto

99
02:20:03,0 --> 02:20:03,0
you a pattern

100
02:20:03,0 --> 02:20:03,0
in all

101
02:20:03,0 --> 02:20:03,0
things, that

102
02:20:03,0 --> 02:20:03,0
ye may not

103
02:20:03,0 --> 02:20:03,0
be deceived;

104
02:20:03,0 --> 02:20:03,0
for Satan

105
02:20:03,0 --> 02:20:03,0
is abroad

106
02:20:03,0 --> 02:20:03,0
in the land,

107
02:20:03,0 --> 02:20:03,0
and he

108
02:20:03,0 --> 02:20:03,0
goeth forth

109
02:20:03,0 --> 02:30:42,
deceiving the nations—

110
02:30:42,0 --> 02:30:42,0
15

111
02:30:42,0 --> 02:30:42,0
Wherefore he that

112
02:30:42,0 --> 02:30:42,0
prayeth,

113
02:30:42,0 --> 02:30:42,0
whose spirit

114
02:30:42,0 --> 02:30:42,0
is contrite,

115
02:30:42,0 --> 02:30:42,0
the same

116
02:30:42,0 --> 02:30:42,0
is accepted

117
02:30:42,0 --> 02:30:42,0
of me if he

118
02:30:42,0 --> 02:30:42,0
obey mine

119
02:30:42,0 --> 02:37:50,
ordinances.

120
02:37:50,0 --> 02:37:50,0
16 He that

121
02:37:50,0 --> 02:37:50,0
speaketh,

122
02:37:50,0 --> 02:37:50,0
whose

123
02:37:50,0 --> 02:37:50,0
spirit is

124
02:37:50,0 --> 02:37:50,0
contrite,

125
02:37:50,0 --> 02:37:50,0
whose

126
02:37:50,0 --> 02:37:50,0
language is meek

127
02:37:50,0 --> 02:37:50,0
and

128
02:37:50,0 --> 02:37:50,0
edifieth, the

129
02:37:50,0 --> 02:37:50,0
same is of

130
02:37:50,0 --> 02:37:50,0
God if he

131
02:37:50,0 --> 02:40:46,
obey mine ordinances.

132
02:40:46,0 --> 02:40:46,0
17 And

133
02:40:46,0 --> 02:40:46,0
again, he

134
02:40:46,0 --> 02:40:46,0
that

135
02:40:46,0 --> 02:40:46,0
trembleth

136
02:40:46,0 --> 02:40:46,0
under my

137
02:40:46,0 --> 02:40:46,0
power shall

138
02:40:46,0 --> 02:40:46,0
be made

139
02:40:46,0 --> 02:40:46,0
strong, and

140
02:40:46,0 --> 02:40:46,0
shall

141
02:40:46,0 --> 02:40:46,0
bring forth

142
02:40:46,0 --> 02:40:46,0
fruits

143
02:40:46,0 --> 02:40:46,0
of praise

144
02:40:46,0 --> 02:40:46,0
and

145
02:40:46,0 --> 02:40:46,0
wisdom,

146
02:40:46,0 --> 02:40:46,0
according to

147
02:40:46,0 --> 02:40:46,0
the

148
02:40:46,0 --> 02:40:46,0
revelations and

149
02:40:46,0 --> 02:40:46,0
truths

150
02:40:46,0 --> 02:52:57,
which I have given you.

151
02:52:57,0 --> 02:52:57,0
18 And

152
02:52:57,0 --> 02:52:57,0
again, he

153
02:52:57,0 --> 02:52:57,0
that is

154
02:52:57,0 --> 02:52:57,0


155
02:52:57,0 --> 02:52:57,0
overcome and

156
02:52:57,0 --> 02:52:57,0
bringeth

157
02:52:57,0 --> 02:52:57,0
not forth

158
02:52:57,0 --> 02:52:57,0
fruits,

159
02:52:57,0 --> 02:52:57,0
even

160
02:52:57,0 --> 02:52:57,0
according

161
02:52:57,0 --> 02:52:57,0
to this

162
02:52:57,0 --> 02:52:57,0
pattern,

163
02:52:57,0 --> 02:59:52,
is not of me.

164
02:59:52,0 --> 02:59:52,0
19

165
02:59:52,0 --> 02:59:52,0
Wherefore,

166
02:59:52,0 --> 02:59:52,0
by this

167
02:59:52,0 --> 02:59:52,0


168
02:59:52,0 --> 02:59:52,0
pattern ye

169
02:59:52,0 --> 02:59:52,0
shall

170
02:59:52,0 --> 02:59:52,0
know the

171
02:59:52,0 --> 02:59:52,0
spirits

172
02:59:52,0 --> 02:59:52,0
in all

173
02:59:52,0 --> 02:59:52,0

03:03:51,0 --> 03:03:51,0
the

178
03:03:51,0 --> 03:03:51,0

03:03:51,0 --> 03:03:51,0
faith it

185
03:03:51,0 --> 03:03:51,0

03:03:51,0 --> 03:03:51,0
be

187
03:03:51,0 --> 03:09:02,
done unto them.
