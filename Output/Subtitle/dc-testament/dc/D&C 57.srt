00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 57 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Prophet, in Zion, Jackson County, Missouri,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
July 20, 1831. In compliance with the Lord’s

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
command to travel to Missouri, where He would reveal

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
“the land of your inheritance” (
section 52), the

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
elders had journeyed from Ohio to Missouri’s

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
western border. Joseph Smith contemplated the state

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of the Lamanites and wondered: “When will the

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
wilderness blossom as the rose? When will Zion be

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
built up in her glory, and where will Thy temple

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
stand, unto which all nations shall come in the last

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
days?” Subsequently he received this revelation.

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
1–3, Independence, Missouri, is the place for

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the City of Zion and the temple; 
4–7, The Saints

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
are to purchase lands and receive inheritances in

16
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
that area; 
8–16, Sidney Gilbert is to establish

17
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
a store, William W. Phelps is to be a printer,

18
00:00:00,0 --> 02:27:49,
and Oliver Cowdery is to edit material for publication. 

19
02:27:49,0 --> 02:27:49,0
1 Hearken, O ye elders of my church, saith

20
02:27:49,0 --> 02:27:49,0
the Lord your God, who have assembled

21
02:27:49,0 --> 02:27:49,0
yourselves together, according to my commandments,

22
02:27:49,0 --> 02:27:49,0
in this land, which is the land of Missouri,

23
02:27:49,0 --> 02:27:49,0
which is the land which I have appointed

24
02:27:49,0 --> 02:28:53,
and consecrated for the gathering of the saints.

25
02:28:53,0 --> 02:28:53,0
2 Wherefore, this is the land of

26
02:28:53,0 --> 02:56:29,
promise, and the place for the city of Zion.

27
02:56:29,0 --> 02:56:29,0
3 And thus saith the Lord your

28
02:56:29,0 --> 02:56:29,0
God, if you will receive wisdom here

29
02:56:29,0 --> 02:56:29,0
is wisdom. Behold, the place which

30
02:56:29,0 --> 02:56:29,0
is now called Independence is the

31
02:56:29,0 --> 02:56:29,0
center place; and a spot for the

32
02:56:29,0 --> 02:56:29,0
temple is lying westward, upon a

33
02:56:29,0 --> 03:03:32,
lot which is not far from the courthouse.

34
03:03:32,0 --> 03:03:32,0
4 Wherefore, it is wisdom

35
03:03:32,0 --> 03:03:32,0
that the land should be

36
03:03:32,0 --> 03:03:32,0
purchased by the saints, and also

37
03:03:32,0 --> 03:03:32,0
every tract lying westward,

38
03:03:32,0 --> 03:03:32,0
even unto the line running

39
03:03:32,0 --> 03:36:31,
directly between Jew and Gentile;

40
03:36:31,0 --> 03:36:31,0
5 And also every tract

41
03:36:31,0 --> 03:36:31,0
bordering by the prairies,

42
03:36:31,0 --> 03:36:31,0
inasmuch as my disciples

43
03:36:31,0 --> 03:36:31,0
are enabled to buy lands.

44
03:36:31,0 --> 03:36:31,0
Behold, this is wisdom,

45
03:36:31,0 --> 03:36:31,0
that they may obtain it

46
03:36:31,0 --> 03:51:33,
for an everlasting inheritance.

47
03:51:33,0 --> 03:51:33,0
6 And let my servant

48
03:51:33,0 --> 03:51:33,0
Sidney Gilbert stand in

49
03:51:33,0 --> 03:51:33,0
the office to which I

50
03:51:33,0 --> 03:51:33,0
have appointed him,

51
03:51:33,0 --> 03:51:33,0
to receive moneys, to

52
03:51:33,0 --> 03:51:33,0
be an agent unto the

53
03:51:33,0 --> 03:51:33,0
church, to buy land in

54
03:51:33,0 --> 03:51:33,0
all the regions round

55
03:51:33,0 --> 03:51:33,0
about, inasmuch as can

56
03:51:33,0 --> 03:51:33,0
be done in

57
03:51:33,0 --> 03:55:11,
righteousness, and as wisdom shall direct.

58
03:55:11,0 --> 03:55:11,0
7 And let my servant

59
03:55:11,0 --> 03:55:11,0
Edward Partridge

60
03:55:11,0 --> 03:55:11,0
stand in the office to

61
03:55:11,0 --> 03:55:11,0
which I have appointed

62
03:55:11,0 --> 03:55:11,0
him, and divide unto

63
03:55:11,0 --> 03:55:11,0
the saints their

64
03:55:11,0 --> 03:55:11,0
inheritance, even as I

65
03:55:11,0 --> 03:55:11,0
have commanded; and

66
03:55:11,0 --> 03:55:11,0
also those whom he has

67
03:55:11,0 --> 04:06:11,
appointed to assist him.

68
04:06:11,0 --> 04:06:11,0
8 And again, verily

69
04:06:11,0 --> 04:06:11,0
I say unto you, let

70
04:06:11,0 --> 04:06:11,0
my servant Sidney

71
04:06:11,0 --> 04:06:11,0
Gilbert plant himself

72
04:06:11,0 --> 04:06:11,0
in this place, and

73
04:06:11,0 --> 04:06:11,0
establish a store,

74
04:06:11,0 --> 04:06:11,0
that he may sell goods

75
04:06:11,0 --> 04:06:11,0
without fraud, that

76
04:06:11,0 --> 04:06:11,0
he may obtain money

77
04:06:11,0 --> 04:06:11,0
to buy lands for

78
04:06:11,0 --> 04:06:11,0
the good of the

79
04:06:11,0 --> 04:06:11,0
saints, and that he may

80
04:06:11,0 --> 04:06:11,0
obtain whatsoever

81
04:06:11,0 --> 04:06:11,0
things the disciples may

82
04:06:11,0 --> 04:06:11,0
need to plant them

83
04:06:11,0 --> 04:18:47,
in their inheritance.

84
04:18:47,0 --> 04:18:47,0
9 And also let my

85
04:18:47,0 --> 04:18:47,0
servant Sidney

86
04:18:47,0 --> 04:18:47,0
Gilbert obtain a

87
04:18:47,0 --> 04:18:47,0
license—behold here is

88
04:18:47,0 --> 04:18:47,0
wisdom, and whoso

89
04:18:47,0 --> 04:18:47,0
readeth let him

90
04:18:47,0 --> 04:18:47,0
understand—that he may

91
04:18:47,0 --> 04:18:47,0
send goods also unto

92
04:18:47,0 --> 04:18:47,0
the people, even by

93
04:18:47,0 --> 04:18:47,0
whom he will as

94
04:18:47,0 --> 04:42:22,
clerks employed in his service;

95
04:42:22,0 --> 04:42:22,0
10 And thus

96
04:42:22,0 --> 04:42:22,0
provide for my

97
04:42:22,0 --> 04:42:22,0
saints, that my

98
04:42:22,0 --> 04:42:22,0
gospel may be

99
04:42:22,0 --> 04:42:22,0
preached unto those who

100
04:42:22,0 --> 04:42:22,0
sit in darkness

101
04:42:22,0 --> 04:42:22,0
and in the

102
04:42:22,0 --> 04:47:27,
region and shadow of death.

103
04:47:27,0 --> 04:47:27,0
11 And again,

104
04:47:27,0 --> 04:47:27,0
verily I say unto

105
04:47:27,0 --> 04:47:27,0
you, let my

106
04:47:27,0 --> 04:47:27,0
servant William W.

107
04:47:27,0 --> 04:47:27,0
Phelps be planted

108
04:47:27,0 --> 04:47:27,0
in this place,

109
04:47:27,0 --> 04:47:27,0
and be

110
04:47:27,0 --> 04:47:27,0
established as a printer

111
04:47:27,0 --> 05:13:58,
unto the church.

112
05:13:58,0 --> 05:13:58,0
12 And lo, if

113
05:13:58,0 --> 05:13:58,0
the world

114
05:13:58,0 --> 05:13:58,0
receive his

115
05:13:58,0 --> 05:13:58,0
writings—behold here is

116
05:13:58,0 --> 05:13:58,0
wisdom—let him

117
05:13:58,0 --> 05:13:58,0
obtain

118
05:13:58,0 --> 05:13:58,0
whatsoever he can

119
05:13:58,0 --> 05:13:58,0
obtain in

120
05:13:58,0 --> 05:13:58,0
righteousness, for the

121
05:13:58,0 --> 05:50:01,
good of the saints.

122
05:50:01,0 --> 05:50:01,0
13 And let my

123
05:50:01,0 --> 05:50:01,0
servant Oliver

124
05:50:01,0 --> 05:50:01,0
Cowdery

125
05:50:01,0 --> 05:50:01,0
assist him, even as

126
05:50:01,0 --> 05:50:01,0
I have

127
05:50:01,0 --> 05:50:01,0
commanded, in

128
05:50:01,0 --> 05:50:01,0
whatsoever place I

129
05:50:01,0 --> 05:50:01,0
shall appoint

130
05:50:01,0 --> 05:50:01,0
unto him, to

131
05:50:01,0 --> 05:50:01,0
copy, and to

132
05:50:01,0 --> 05:50:01,0
correct, and

133
05:50:01,0 --> 05:50:01,0
select, that all

134
05:50:01,0 --> 05:50:01,0
things may be

135
05:50:01,0 --> 05:50:01,0
right before

136
05:50:01,0 --> 05:50:01,0
me, as it shall

137
05:50:01,0 --> 05:50:01,0
be proved by

138
05:50:01,0 --> 06:17:37,
the Spirit through him.

139
06:17:37,0 --> 06:17:37,0
14 And thus

140
06:17:37,0 --> 06:17:37,0
let those of

141
06:17:37,0 --> 06:17:37,0
whom I have

142
06:17:37,0 --> 06:17:37,0
spoken be

143
06:17:37,0 --> 06:17:37,0
planted in the

144
06:17:37,0 --> 06:17:37,0
land of Zion, as

145
06:17:37,0 --> 06:17:37,0
speedily as

146
06:17:37,0 --> 06:17:37,0
can be, with

147
06:17:37,0 --> 06:17:37,0
their

148
06:17:37,0 --> 06:17:37,0
families, to do

149
06:17:37,0 --> 06:17:37,0
those things even

150
06:17:37,0 --> 06:23:42,
as I have spoken.

151
06:23:42,0 --> 06:23:42,0
15 And now

152
06:23:42,0 --> 06:23:42,0
concerning

153
06:23:42,0 --> 06:23:42,0
the

154
06:23:42,0 --> 06:23:42,0
gathering—Let the

155
06:23:42,0 --> 06:23:42,0
bishop and the

156
06:23:42,0 --> 06:23:42,0
agent make

157
06:23:42,0 --> 06:23:42,0
preparations

158
06:23:42,0 --> 06:23:42,0
for those

159
06:23:42,0 --> 06:23:42,0
families which

160
06:23:42,0 --> 06:23:42,0
have been

161
06:23:42,0 --> 06:23:42,0
commanded to

162
06:23:42,0 --> 06:23:42,0
come to this

163
06:23:42,0 --> 06:23:42,0
land, as

164
06:23:42,0 --> 06:23:42,0
soon as

165
06:23:42,0 --> 06:23:42,0
possible, and plant

166
06:23:42,0 --> 06:28:46,
them in their inheritance.

167
06:28:46,0 --> 06:28:46,0
16 And unto

168
06:28:46,0 --> 06:28:46,0
the

169
06:28:46,0 --> 06:28:46,0
residue of both

170
06:28:46,0 --> 06:28:46,0
elders and

171
06:28:46,0 --> 06:28:46,0
members

172
06:28:46,0 --> 06:28:46,0
further

173
06:28:46,0 --> 06:28:46,0
directions shall

174
06:28:46,0 --> 06:28:46,0
be given

175
06:28:46,0 --> 06:28:46,0
hereafter.

176
06:28:46,0 --> 06:32:25,
Even so. Amen.
