1
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:18,889
Section 57 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:18,889 --> 00:00:26,5
 the Prophet, in Zion, Jackson County, Missouri,

3
00:00:26,5 --> 00:00:34,111
 July 20, 1831. In compliance with the Lord’s command

4
00:00:34,111 --> 00:00:41,722
 to travel to Missouri, where He would reveal “the

5
00:00:41,722 --> 00:00:49,333
 land of your inheritance” (
section 52), the

6
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:56,944
 elders had journeyed from Ohio to Missouri’s western

7
00:00:56,944 --> 00:01:04,555
 border. Joseph Smith contemplated the state of the

8
00:01:04,555 --> 00:01:12,166
 Lamanites and wondered: “When will the wilderness

9
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:19,777
 blossom as the rose? When will Zion be built up in

10
00:01:19,777 --> 00:01:27,388
 her glory, and where will Thy temple stand, unto

11
00:01:27,388 --> 00:01:34,999
 which all nations shall come in the last days?”

12
00:01:34,999 --> 00:01:42,61
 Subsequently he received this revelation. 
1–3,

13
00:01:42,61 --> 00:01:50,221
 Independence, Missouri, is the place for the City of

14
00:01:50,221 --> 00:01:57,832
 Zion and the temple; 
4–7, The Saints are to

15
00:01:57,832 --> 00:02:05,443
 purchase lands and receive inheritances in that area;

16
00:02:05,443 --> 00:02:13,054
8–16, Sidney Gilbert is to establish a store,

17
00:02:13,054 --> 00:02:20,665
 William W. Phelps is to be a printer, and Oliver Cowdery

18
00:02:20,665 --> 00:02:28,276
 is to edit material for publication.

19
00:02:28,165 --> 00:02:32,832
1 Hearken, O ye elders of my church, saith the

20
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:37,499
 Lord your God, who have assembled yourselves

21
00:02:37,499 --> 00:02:42,166
 together, according to my commandments, in this land,

22
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:46,833
 which is the land of Missouri, which is the land which

23
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:51,5
 I have appointed and consecrated for the

24
00:02:51,5 --> 00:02:56,167
 gathering of the saints

25
00:02:56,443 --> 00:03:00,443
2 Wherefore, this is the land of promise, and the

26
00:03:00,443 --> 00:03:04,443
 place for the city of Zion

27
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:11,351
3 And thus saith the Lord your God, if you will

28
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:17,951
 receive wisdom here is wisdom. Behold, the place

29
00:03:17,951 --> 00:03:24,551
 which is now called Independence is the center place;

30
00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:31,151
 and a spot for the temple is lying westward, upon

31
00:03:31,151 --> 00:03:37,751
 a lot which is not far from the courthouse

32
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:42,017
4 Wherefore, it is wisdom that the land should be

33
00:03:42,017 --> 00:03:46,517
 purchased by the saints, and also every tract

34
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:51,017
 lying westward, even unto the line running directly

35
00:03:51,017 --> 00:03:55,517
 between Jew and Gentile

36
00:03:55,035 --> 00:04:01,285
5 And also every tract bordering by the prairies,

37
00:04:01,285 --> 00:04:07,535
 inasmuch as my disciples are enabled to buy lands.

38
00:04:07,535 --> 00:04:13,785
 Behold, this is wisdom, that they may obtain it

39
00:04:13,785 --> 00:04:20,035
 for an everlasting inheritance

40
00:04:20,043 --> 00:04:24,71
6 And let my servant Sidney Gilbert stand in the

41
00:04:24,71 --> 00:04:29,377
 office to which I have appointed him, to receive

42
00:04:29,377 --> 00:04:34,044
 moneys, to be an agent unto the church, to buy land

43
00:04:34,044 --> 00:04:38,711
 in all the regions round about, inasmuch as can be

44
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:43,378
 done in righteousness, and as wisdom shall

45
00:04:43,378 --> 00:04:48,045
 direct

46
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:53,288
7 And let my servant Edward Partridge stand in the

47
00:04:53,288 --> 00:04:58,488
 office to which I have appointed him, and divide

48
00:04:58,488 --> 00:05:03,688
 unto the saints their inheritance, even as I have

49
00:05:03,688 --> 00:05:08,888
 commanded; and also those whom he has appointed to

50
00:05:08,888 --> 00:05:14,088
 assist him

51
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:19,991
8 And again, verily I say unto you, let my servant

52
00:05:19,991 --> 00:05:25,134
 Sidney Gilbert plant himself in this place, and

53
00:05:25,134 --> 00:05:30,277
 establish a store, that he may sell goods without

54
00:05:30,277 --> 00:05:35,42
 fraud, that he may obtain money to buy lands for

55
00:05:35,42 --> 00:05:40,563
 the good of the saints, and that he may obtain

56
00:05:40,563 --> 00:05:45,706
 whatsoever things the disciples may need to plant them

57
00:05:45,706 --> 00:05:50,849
 in their inheritance

58
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:56,417
9 And also let my servant Sidney Gilbert obtain a

59
00:05:56,417 --> 00:06:02,017
 license—behold here is wisdom, and whoso readeth

60
00:06:02,017 --> 00:06:07,617
 let him understand—that he may send goods also unto

61
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:13,217
 the people, even by whom he will as clerks

62
00:06:13,217 --> 00:06:18,817
 employed in his service

63
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:24,978
10 And thus provide for my saints, that my gospel

64
00:06:24,978 --> 00:06:31,645
 may be preached unto those who sit in darkness and

65
00:06:31,645 --> 00:06:38,312
 in the region and shadow of death

66
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:43,731
11 And again, verily I say unto you, let my

67
00:06:43,731 --> 00:06:49,398
 servant William W. Phelps be planted in this place, and

68
00:06:49,398 --> 00:06:55,065
 be established as a printer unto the church

69
00:06:55,081 --> 00:07:00,081
12 And lo, if the world receive his

70
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:05,081
 writings—behold here is wisdom—let him obtain whatsoever he can

71
00:07:05,081 --> 00:07:10,081
 obtain in righteousness, for the good of the

72
00:07:10,081 --> 00:07:15,081
 saints

73
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:21,669
13 And let my servant Oliver Cowdery assist him,

74
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:27,469
 even as I have commanded, in whatsoever place I

75
00:07:27,469 --> 00:07:33,269
 shall appoint unto him, to copy, and to correct, and

76
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:39,069
 select, that all things may be right before me, as

77
00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:44,869
 it shall be proved by the Spirit through him

78
00:07:44,147 --> 00:07:49,147
14 And thus let those of whom I have spoken be

79
00:07:49,147 --> 00:07:54,147
 planted in the land of Zion, as speedily as can be,

80
00:07:54,147 --> 00:07:59,147
 with their families, to do those things even as I

81
00:07:59,147 --> 00:08:04,147
 have spoken

82
00:08:04,434 --> 00:08:09,434
15 And now concerning the gathering—Let the bishop

83
00:08:09,434 --> 00:08:14,434
 and the agent make preparations for those

84
00:08:14,434 --> 00:08:19,434
 families which have been commanded to come to this land,

85
00:08:19,434 --> 00:08:24,434
 as soon as possible, and plant them in their

86
00:08:24,434 --> 00:08:29,434
 inheritance

87
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:34,376
16 And unto the residue of both elders and members

88
00:08:34,376 --> 00:08:39,043
 further directions shall be given hereafter. Even

89
00:08:39,043 --> 00:08:43,71
 so. Amen.
