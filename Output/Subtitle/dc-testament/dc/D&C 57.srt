00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:03,444
Section 57 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:03,444 --> 00:00:06,888
the Prophet, in Zion, Jackson County, Missouri,

3
00:00:06,888 --> 00:00:10,332
July 20, 1831. In compliance with the Lord’s

4
00:00:10,332 --> 00:00:13,776
command to travel to Missouri, where He would reveal

5
00:00:13,776 --> 00:00:17,22
“the land of your inheritance” (
section 52), the

6
00:00:17,22 --> 00:00:20,664
elders had journeyed from Ohio to Missouri’s

7
00:00:20,664 --> 00:00:24,108
western border. Joseph Smith contemplated the state

8
00:00:24,108 --> 00:00:27,552
of the Lamanites and wondered: “When will the

9
00:00:27,552 --> 00:00:30,996
wilderness blossom as the rose? When will Zion be

10
00:00:30,996 --> 00:00:34,44
built up in her glory, and where will Thy temple

11
00:00:34,44 --> 00:00:37,884
stand, unto which all nations shall come in the last

12
00:00:37,884 --> 00:00:41,328
days?” Subsequently he received this revelation.

13
00:00:41,328 --> 00:00:44,772
1–3, Independence, Missouri, is the place for

14
00:00:44,772 --> 00:00:48,216
the City of Zion and the temple; 
4–7, The Saints

15
00:00:48,216 --> 00:00:51,66
are to purchase lands and receive inheritances in

16
00:00:51,66 --> 00:00:55,104
that area; 
8–16, Sidney Gilbert is to establish

17
00:00:55,104 --> 00:00:58,548
a store, William W. Phelps is to be a printer,

18
00:00:58,548 --> 00:01:02,996
and Oliver Cowdery is to edit material for publication. 

19
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:03,329
1 Hearken, O ye elders of my church, saith

20
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:03,662
the Lord your God, who have assembled

21
00:01:03,662 --> 00:01:03,995
yourselves together, according to my commandments,

22
00:01:03,995 --> 00:01:04,328
in this land, which is the land of Missouri,

23
00:01:04,328 --> 00:01:04,661
which is the land which I have appointed

24
00:01:04,661 --> 00:01:04,064
and consecrated for the gathering of the saints.

25
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:01,564
2 Wherefore, this is the land of

26
00:01:01,564 --> 00:00:59,726
promise, and the place for the city of Zion.

27
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:00,44
3 And thus saith the Lord your

28
00:01:00,44 --> 00:01:01,154
God, if you will receive wisdom here

29
00:01:01,154 --> 00:01:01,868
is wisdom. Behold, the place which

30
00:01:01,868 --> 00:01:02,582
is now called Independence is the

31
00:01:02,582 --> 00:01:03,296
center place; and a spot for the

32
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:04,01
temple is lying westward, upon a

33
00:01:04,01 --> 00:01:04,815
lot which is not far from the courthouse.

34
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:04,148
4 Wherefore, it is wisdom

35
00:01:04,148 --> 00:01:03,481
that the land should be

36
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:02,814
purchased by the saints, and also

37
00:01:02,814 --> 00:01:02,147
every tract lying westward,

38
00:01:02,147 --> 00:01:01,48
even unto the line running

39
00:01:01,48 --> 00:01:00,477
directly between Jew and Gentile;

40
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:01,048
5 And also every tract

41
00:01:01,048 --> 00:01:01,619
bordering by the prairies,

42
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:02,19
inasmuch as my disciples

43
00:01:02,19 --> 00:01:02,761
are enabled to buy lands.

44
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:03,332
Behold, this is wisdom,

45
00:01:03,332 --> 00:01:03,903
that they may obtain it

46
00:01:03,903 --> 00:01:04,598
for an everlasting inheritance.

47
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:04,234
6 And let my servant

48
00:01:04,234 --> 00:01:03,87
Sidney Gilbert stand in

49
00:01:03,87 --> 00:01:03,506
the office to which I

50
00:01:03,506 --> 00:01:03,142
have appointed him,

51
00:01:03,142 --> 00:01:02,778
to receive moneys, to

52
00:01:02,778 --> 00:01:02,414
be an agent unto the

53
00:01:02,414 --> 00:01:02,05
church, to buy land in

54
00:01:02,05 --> 00:01:01,686
all the regions round

55
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:01,322
about, inasmuch as can

56
00:01:01,322 --> 00:01:00,958
be done in

57
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:00,26
righteousness, and as wisdom shall direct.

58
00:01:00,26 --> 00:01:00,66
7 And let my servant

59
00:01:00,66 --> 00:01:01,06
Edward Partridge

60
00:01:01,06 --> 00:01:01,46
stand in the office to

61
00:01:01,46 --> 00:01:01,86
which I have appointed

62
00:01:01,86 --> 00:01:02,26
him, and divide unto

63
00:01:02,26 --> 00:01:02,66
the saints their

64
00:01:02,66 --> 00:01:03,06
inheritance, even as I

65
00:01:03,06 --> 00:01:03,46
have commanded; and

66
00:01:03,46 --> 00:01:03,86
also those whom he has

67
00:01:03,86 --> 00:01:04,881
appointed to assist him.

68
00:01:04,881 --> 00:01:04,631
8 And again, verily

69
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:04,381
I say unto you, let

70
00:01:04,381 --> 00:01:04,131
my servant Sidney

71
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:03,881
Gilbert plant himself

72
00:01:03,881 --> 00:01:03,631
in this place, and

73
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:03,381
establish a store,

74
00:01:03,381 --> 00:01:03,131
that he may sell goods

75
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:02,881
without fraud, that

76
00:01:02,881 --> 00:01:02,631
he may obtain money

77
00:01:02,631 --> 00:01:02,381
to buy lands for

78
00:01:02,381 --> 00:01:02,131
the good of the

79
00:01:02,131 --> 00:01:01,881
saints, and that he may

80
00:01:01,881 --> 00:01:01,631
obtain whatsoever

81
00:01:01,631 --> 00:01:01,381
things the disciples may

82
00:01:01,381 --> 00:01:01,131
need to plant them

83
00:01:01,131 --> 00:01:00,544
in their inheritance.

84
00:01:00,544 --> 00:01:00,908
9 And also let my

85
00:01:00,908 --> 00:01:01,272

Gilbert obtain a

87
00:01:01,636 --> 00:01:01,0
license—behold here is

88
00:01:01,0 --> 00:01:02,364
wisdom, and whoso

89
00:01:02,364 --> 00:01:02,728
readeth let him

90
00:01:02,728 --> 00:01:03,092
understand—that he may

91
00:01:03,092 --> 00:01:03,456
send goods also unto

92
00:01:03,456 --> 00:01:03,82
the people, even by

93
00:01:03,82 --> 00:01:04,184
whom he will as

94
00:01:04,184 --> 00:01:04,665
clerks employed in his service;

95
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:04,165
10 And thus

96
00:01:04,165 --> 00:01:03,665
provide for my

97
00:01:03,665 --> 00:01:03,165
saints, that my

98
00:01:03,165 --> 00:01:02,665
gospel may be

99
00:01:02,665 --> 00:01:02,165
preached unto those who

100
00:01:02,165 --> 00:01:01,665
sit in darkness

101
00:01:01,665 --> 00:01:01,165
and in the

102
00:01:01,165 --> 00:01:00,327
region and shadow of death.

103
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:00,771
11 And again,

104
00:01:00,771 --> 00:01:01,215
verily I say unto

105
00:01:01,215 --> 00:01:01,659
you, let my

106
00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:02,103
servant William W.

107
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:02,547
Phelps be planted

108
00:01:02,547 --> 00:01:02,991
in this place,

109
00:01:02,991 --> 00:01:03,435
and be

110
00:01:03,435 --> 00:01:03,879
established as a printer

111
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:04,948
unto the church.

112
00:01:04,948 --> 00:01:04,548
12 And lo, if

113
00:01:04,548 --> 00:01:04,148
the world

114
00:01:04,148 --> 00:01:03,748

115
00:01:03,748 --> 00:01:03,348
writings—behold here is

116
00:01:03,348 --> 00:01:02,948
wisdom—let him

117
00:01:02,948 --> 00:01:02,548
obtain

118
00:01:02,548 --> 00:01:02,148
whatsoever he can

119
00:01:02,148 --> 00:01:01,748
obtain in

120
00:01:01,748 --> 00:01:01,348
righteousness, for the

121
00:01:01,348 --> 00:01:00,611
good of the saints.

122
00:01:00,611 --> 00:01:00,846
13 And let my

123
00:01:00,846 --> 00:01:01,081
servant Oliver

124
00:01:01,081 --> 00:01:01,316
Cowdery

125
00:01:01,316 --> 00:01:01,551
assist him, even as

126
00:01:01,551 --> 00:01:01,786
I have

127
00:01:01,786 --> 00:01:02,021
commanded, in

128
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:02,256
whatsoever place I

129
00:01:02,256 --> 00:01:02,491
shall appoint

130
00:01:02,491 --> 00:01:02,726
unto him, to

131
00:01:02,726 --> 00:01:02,961
copy, and to

132
00:01:02,961 --> 00:01:03,196
correct, and

133
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:03,431
select, that all

134
00:01:03,431 --> 00:01:03,666
things may be

135
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:03,901
right before

136
00:01:03,901 --> 00:01:04,136
me, as it shall

137
00:01:04,136 --> 00:01:04,371
be proved by

138
00:01:04,371 --> 00:01:04,731
the Spirit through him.

139
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:04,398
14 And thus

140
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:04,065
let those of

141
00:01:04,065 --> 00:01:03,732

142
00:01:03,732 --> 00:01:03,399
spoken be

143
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:03,066
planted in the

144
00:01:03,066 --> 00:01:02,733
land of Zion, as

145
00:01:02,733 --> 00:01:02,4
speedily as

146
00:01:02,4 --> 00:01:02,067
can be, with

147
00:01:02,067 --> 00:01:01,734
their

148
00:01:01,734 --> 00:01:01,401
families, to do

149
00:01:01,401 --> 00:01:01,068
those things even

150
00:01:01,068 --> 00:01:00,394
as I have spoken.

151
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:00,644
15 And now

152
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:00,894
concerning

153
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:01,144
the

154
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:01,394
gathering—Let the

155
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:01,644
bishop and the

156
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:01,894
agent make

157
00:01:01,894 --> 00:01:02,144
preparations

158
00:01:02,144 --> 00:01:02,394
for those

159
00:01:02,394 --> 00:01:02,644
families which

160
00:01:02,644 --> 00:01:02,894
have been

161
00:01:02,894 --> 00:01:03,144
commanded to

162
00:01:03,144 --> 00:01:03,394

163
00:01:03,394 --> 00:01:03,644
land, as

164
00:01:03,644 --> 00:01:03,894

165
00:01:03,894 --> 00:01:04,144
possible, and plant

166
00:01:04,144 --> 00:01:04,514
them in their inheritance.

167
00:01:04,514 --> 00:01:04,114
16 And unto

168
00:01:04,114 --> 00:01:03,714

169
00:01:03,714 --> 00:01:03,314
residue of both

170
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:02,914
elders and

171
00:01:02,914 --> 00:01:02,514
members

172
00:01:02,514 --> 00:01:02,114
further

173
00:01:02,114 --> 00:01:01,714
directions shall

174
00:01:01,714 --> 00:01:01,314
be given

175
00:01:01,314 --> 00:01:00,914
hereafter.

176
00:01:00,914 --> 00:01:00,177
Even so. Amen.
