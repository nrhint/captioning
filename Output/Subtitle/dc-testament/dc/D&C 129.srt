00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 129 Instructions given by Joseph

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Smith the Prophet, at Nauvoo, Illinois,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
February 9, 1843, making known three grand keys by

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
which the correct nature of ministering

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
angels and spirits may be distinguished. 
1–3,

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
There are both resurrected and spirit bodies

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
in heaven; 
4–9, Keys are given whereby

8
00:00:00,0 --> 01:14:53,
messengers from beyond the veil may be identified. 

9
01:14:53,0 --> 01:14:53,0
1 There are two kinds of beings in

10
01:14:53,0 --> 01:14:53,0
heaven, namely: Angels, who are resurrected

11
01:14:53,0 --> 01:23:56,
personages, having bodies of flesh and bones—

12
01:23:56,0 --> 01:23:56,0
2 For instance, Jesus said: Handle

13
01:23:56,0 --> 01:23:56,0
me and see, for a spirit hath not

14
01:23:56,0 --> 01:27:35,
flesh and bones, as ye see me have.

15
01:27:35,0 --> 01:27:35,0
3 Secondly: the spirits of

16
01:27:35,0 --> 01:27:35,0
just men made perfect,

17
01:27:35,0 --> 01:27:35,0
they who are not

18
01:27:35,0 --> 01:42:37,
resurrected, but inherit the same glory.

19
01:42:37,0 --> 01:42:37,0
4 When a messenger

20
01:42:37,0 --> 01:42:37,0
comes saying he has a

21
01:42:37,0 --> 01:42:37,0
message from God, offer him

22
01:42:37,0 --> 01:42:37,0
your hand and request

23
01:42:37,0 --> 02:03:40,
him to shake hands with you.

24
02:03:40,0 --> 02:03:40,0
5 If he be an angel

25
02:03:40,0 --> 02:03:40,0
he will do so, and

26
02:03:40,0 --> 02:18:42,
you will feel his hand.

27
02:18:42,0 --> 02:18:42,0
6 If he be the

28
02:18:42,0 --> 02:18:42,0
spirit of a just man

29
02:18:42,0 --> 02:18:42,0
made perfect he will

30
02:18:42,0 --> 02:18:42,0
come in his glory;

31
02:18:42,0 --> 02:18:42,0
for that is the

32
02:18:42,0 --> 02:25:45,
only way he can appear—

33
02:25:45,0 --> 02:25:45,0
7 Ask him to shake

34
02:25:45,0 --> 02:25:45,0
hands with you,

35
02:25:45,0 --> 02:25:45,0
but he will not

36
02:25:45,0 --> 02:25:45,0
move, because it is

37
02:25:45,0 --> 02:25:45,0
contrary to the

38
02:25:45,0 --> 02:25:45,0
order of heaven for a

39
02:25:45,0 --> 02:25:45,0
just man to

40
02:25:45,0 --> 02:25:45,0
deceive; but he will

41
02:25:45,0 --> 02:27:49,
still deliver his message.

42
02:27:49,0 --> 02:27:49,0
8 If it be the

43
02:27:49,0 --> 02:27:49,0
devil as an angel

44
02:27:49,0 --> 02:27:49,0
of light, when

45
02:27:49,0 --> 02:27:49,0
you ask him to

46
02:27:49,0 --> 02:27:49,0
shake hands he

47
02:27:49,0 --> 02:27:49,0
will offer you his

48
02:27:49,0 --> 02:27:49,0
hand, and you

49
02:27:49,0 --> 02:27:49,0
will not feel

50
02:27:49,0 --> 02:27:49,0
anything; you may

51
02:27:49,0 --> 02:44:51,
therefore detect him.

52
02:44:51,0 --> 02:44:51,0
9 These are

53
02:44:51,0 --> 02:44:51,0
three grand keys

54
02:44:51,0 --> 02:44:51,0
whereby you may

55
02:44:51,0 --> 02:44:51,0
know whether

56
02:44:51,0 --> 02:44:51,0
any

57
02:44:51,0 --> 03:05:54,
administration is from God.
