00:00:11,295 --> 00:00:19,295
Section 129 Instructions given by Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:19,295 --> 00:00:27,295
 Prophet, at Nauvoo, Illinois, February 9, 1843,

3
00:00:27,295 --> 00:00:35,295
 making known three grand keys by which the correct

4
00:00:35,295 --> 00:00:43,295
 nature of ministering angels and spirits may be

5
00:00:43,295 --> 00:00:51,295
 distinguished. 
1–3, There are both resurrected and

6
00:00:51,295 --> 00:00:59,295
 spirit bodies in heaven; 
4–9, Keys are given

7
00:00:59,295 --> 00:01:07,295
 whereby messengers from beyond the veil may be

8
00:01:07,295 --> 00:01:15,295
 identified.

9
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:19,442
1 There are two kinds of beings in heaven, namely:

10
00:01:19,442 --> 00:01:23,442
 Angels, who are resurrected personages, having

11
00:01:23,442 --> 00:01:27,442
 bodies of flesh and bones

12
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:33,087
2 For instance, Jesus said: Handle me and see, for

13
00:01:33,087 --> 00:01:38,42
 a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me

14
00:01:38,42 --> 00:01:43,753
 have

15
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:50,836
3 Secondly: the spirits of just men made perfect,

16
00:01:50,836 --> 00:01:58,169
 they who are not resurrected, but inherit the same

17
00:01:58,169 --> 00:02:05,502
 glory

18
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:09,925
4 When a messenger comes saying he has a message

19
00:02:09,925 --> 00:02:14,592
 from God, offer him your hand and request him to

20
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:19,259
 shake hands with you

21
00:02:19,256 --> 00:02:23,756
5 If he be an angel he will do so, and you will

22
00:02:23,756 --> 00:02:28,256
 feel his hand

23
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:34,782
6 If he be the spirit of a just man made perfect

24
00:02:34,782 --> 00:02:40,782
 he will come in his glory; for that is the only way

25
00:02:40,782 --> 00:02:46,782
 he can appear

26
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:51,316
7 Ask him to shake hands with you, but he will not

27
00:02:51,316 --> 00:02:56,566
 move, because it is contrary to the order of

28
00:02:56,566 --> 00:03:01,816
 heaven for a just man to deceive; but he will still

29
00:03:01,816 --> 00:03:07,066
 deliver his message

30
00:03:07,07 --> 00:03:11,82
8 If it be the devil as an angel of light, when

31
00:03:11,82 --> 00:03:16,57
 you ask him to shake hands he will offer you his

32
00:03:16,57 --> 00:03:21,32
 hand, and you will not feel anything; you may

33
00:03:21,32 --> 00:03:26,07
 therefore detect him

34
00:03:26,089 --> 00:03:30,589
9 These are three grand keys whereby you may know

35
00:03:30,589 --> 00:03:35,089
 whether any administration is from God.
