1
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:18,966
Section 103 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:18,966 --> 00:00:26,654
 the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, February 24, 1834.

3
00:00:26,654 --> 00:00:34,342
 This revelation was received after the arrival in

4
00:00:34,342 --> 00:00:42,03
 Kirtland, Ohio, of Parley P. Pratt and Lyman

5
00:00:42,03 --> 00:00:49,718
 Wight, who had come from Missouri to counsel with the

6
00:00:49,718 --> 00:00:57,406
 Prophet as to the relief and restoration of the

7
00:00:57,406 --> 00:01:05,094
 Saints to their lands in Jackson County. 
1–4, Why

8
00:01:05,094 --> 00:01:12,782
 the Lord permitted the Saints in Jackson County to

9
00:01:12,782 --> 00:01:20,47
 be persecuted; 
5–10, The Saints will prevail if

10
00:01:20,47 --> 00:01:28,158
 they keep the commandments; 
11–20, The redemption

11
00:01:28,158 --> 00:01:35,846
 of Zion will come by power, and the Lord will go

12
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:43,534
 before His people; 
21–28, The Saints are to gather

13
00:01:43,534 --> 00:01:51,222
 in Zion, and those who lay down their lives will

14
00:01:51,222 --> 00:01:58,91
 find them again; 
29–40, Various brethren are

15
00:01:58,91 --> 00:02:06,598
 called to organize Zion’s Camp and go to Zion; they

16
00:02:06,598 --> 00:02:14,286
 are promised victory if they are faithful.

17
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:18,868
1 Verily I say unto you, my friends, behold, I

18
00:02:18,868 --> 00:02:22,868
 will give unto you a revelation and commandment, that

19
00:02:22,868 --> 00:02:26,868
 you may know how to act in the discharge of your

20
00:02:26,868 --> 00:02:30,868
 duties concerning the salvation and redemption of

21
00:02:30,868 --> 00:02:34,868
 your brethren, who have been scattered on the land

22
00:02:34,868 --> 00:02:38,868
 of Zion

23
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:43,691
2 Being driven and smitten by the hands of mine

24
00:02:43,691 --> 00:02:49,024
 enemies, on whom I will pour out my wrath without

25
00:02:49,024 --> 00:02:54,357
 measure in mine own time

26
00:02:54,891 --> 00:02:58,891
3 For I have suffered them thus far, that they

27
00:02:58,891 --> 00:03:02,891
 might fill up the measure of their iniquities, that

28
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:06,891
 their cup might be full

29
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:11,653
4 And that those who call themselves after my name

30
00:03:11,653 --> 00:03:16,653
 might be chastened for a little season with a

31
00:03:16,653 --> 00:03:21,653
 sore and grievous chastisement, because they did not

32
00:03:21,653 --> 00:03:26,653
 hearken altogether unto the precepts and

33
00:03:26,653 --> 00:03:31,653
 commandments which I gave unto them

34
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:35,178
5 But verily I say unto you, that I have decreed a

35
00:03:35,178 --> 00:03:39,178
 decree which my people shall realize, inasmuch as

36
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:43,178
 they hearken from this very hour unto the counsel

37
00:03:43,178 --> 00:03:47,178
 which I, the Lord their God, shall give unto

38
00:03:47,178 --> 00:03:51,178
 them

39
00:03:51,948 --> 00:03:55,948
6 Behold they shall, for I have decreed it, begin

40
00:03:55,948 --> 00:03:59,948
 to prevail against mine enemies from this very

41
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:03,948
 hour

42
00:04:03,226 --> 00:04:08,393
7 And by hearkening to observe all the words which

43
00:04:08,393 --> 00:04:13,56
 I, the Lord their God, shall speak unto them,

44
00:04:13,56 --> 00:04:18,727
 they shall never cease to prevail until the kingdoms

45
00:04:18,727 --> 00:04:23,894
 of the world are subdued under my feet, and the

46
00:04:23,894 --> 00:04:29,061
 earth is given unto the saints, to possess it

47
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:34,228
 forever and ever

48
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:40,041
8 But inasmuch as they keep not my commandments,

49
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:45,374
 and hearken not to observe all my words, the

50
00:04:45,374 --> 00:04:50,707
 kingdoms of the world shall prevail against them

51
00:04:50,69 --> 00:04:55,69
9 For they were set to be a light unto the world,

52
00:04:55,69 --> 00:05:00,69
 and to be the saviors of men

53
00:05:00,7 --> 00:05:05,7
10 And inasmuch as they are not the saviors of

54
00:05:05,7 --> 00:05:10,7
 men, they are as salt that has lost its savor, and is

55
00:05:10,7 --> 00:05:15,7
 thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out

56
00:05:15,7 --> 00:05:20,7
 and trodden under foot of men

57
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:25,953
11 But verily I say unto you, I have decreed that

58
00:05:25,953 --> 00:05:31,453
 your brethren which have been scattered shall

59
00:05:31,453 --> 00:05:36,953
 return to the lands of their inheritances, and shall

60
00:05:36,953 --> 00:05:42,453
 build up the waste places of Zion

61
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:45,209
12 For after much tribulation, as I have said unto

62
00:05:45,209 --> 00:05:48,209
 you in a former commandment, cometh the blessing

63
00:05:48,209 --> 00:05:51,209


64
00:05:51,001 --> 00:05:55,334
13 Behold, this is the blessing which I have

65
00:05:55,334 --> 00:05:59,667
 promised after your tribulations, and the tribulations

66
00:05:59,667 --> 00:06:03,0
 of your brethren—your redemption, and the

67
00:06:03,0 --> 00:06:08,333
 redemption of your brethren, even their restoration to the

68
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:12,666
 land of Zion, to be established, no more to be

69
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:16,999
 thrown down

70
00:06:17,51 --> 00:06:23,177
14 Nevertheless, if they pollute their

71
00:06:23,177 --> 00:06:28,844
 inheritances they shall be thrown down; for I will not spare

72
00:06:28,844 --> 00:06:34,511
 them if they pollute their inheritances

73
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:39,561
15 Behold, I say unto you, the redemption of Zion

74
00:06:39,561 --> 00:06:44,561
 must needs come by power

75
00:06:44,087 --> 00:06:49,087
16 Therefore, I will raise up unto my people a

76
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:54,087
 man, who shall lead them like as Moses led the

77
00:06:54,087 --> 00:06:59,087
 children of Israel

78
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:07,169
17 For ye are the children of Israel, and of the

79
00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:14,502
 seed of Abraham, and ye must needs be led out of

80
00:07:14,502 --> 00:07:21,835
 bondage by power, and with a stretched-out arm

81
00:07:21,591 --> 00:07:27,591
18 And as your fathers were led at the first, even

82
00:07:27,591 --> 00:07:33,591
 so shall the redemption of Zion be

83
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:41,02
19 Therefore, let not your hearts faint, for I say

84
00:07:41,02 --> 00:07:48,687
 not unto you as I said unto your fathers: Mine

85
00:07:48,687 --> 00:07:56,354
 angel shall go up before you, but not my presence

86
00:07:56,426 --> 00:08:01,759
20 But I say unto you: Mine angels shall go up

87
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:07,092
 before you, and also my presence, and in time ye

88
00:08:07,092 --> 00:08:12,425
 shall possess the goodly land

89
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:17,476
21 Verily, verily I say unto you, that my servant

90
00:08:17,476 --> 00:08:22,226
 Joseph Smith, Jun., is the man to whom I likened

91
00:08:22,226 --> 00:08:26,976
 the servant to whom the Lord of the vineyard spake

92
00:08:26,976 --> 00:08:31,726
 in the parable which I have given unto you

93
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:37,211
22 Therefore let my servant Joseph Smith, Jun.,

94
00:08:37,211 --> 00:08:43,411
 say unto the strength of my house, my young men and

95
00:08:43,411 --> 00:08:49,611
 the middle aged—Gather yourselves together unto

96
00:08:49,611 --> 00:08:55,811
 the land of Zion, upon the land which I have bought

97
00:08:55,811 --> 00:09:02,011
 with money that has been consecrated unto me

98
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:08,643
23 And let all the churches send up wise men with

99
00:09:08,643 --> 00:09:14,31
 their moneys, and purchase lands even as I have

100
00:09:14,31 --> 00:09:19,977
 commanded them

101
00:09:19,275 --> 00:09:25,275
24 And inasmuch as mine enemies come against you

102
00:09:25,275 --> 00:09:31,275
 to drive you from my goodly land, which I have

103
00:09:31,275 --> 00:09:37,275
 consecrated to be the land of Zion, even from your own

104
00:09:37,275 --> 00:09:43,275
 lands after these testimonies, which ye have

105
00:09:43,275 --> 00:09:49,275
 brought before me against them, ye shall curse them

106
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:55,339
25 And whomsoever ye curse, I will curse, and ye

107
00:09:55,339 --> 00:10:01,339
 shall avenge me of mine enemies

108
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:06,634
26 And my presence shall be with you even in

109
00:10:06,634 --> 00:10:11,634
 avenging me of mine enemies, unto the third and fourth

110
00:10:11,634 --> 00:10:16,634
 generation of them that hate me

111
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:22,482
27 Let no man be afraid to lay down his life for

112
00:10:22,482 --> 00:10:28,815
 my sake; for whoso layeth down his life for my sake

113
00:10:28,815 --> 00:10:35,148
 shall find it again

114
00:10:35,652 --> 00:10:41,652
28 And whoso is not willing to lay down his life

115
00:10:41,652 --> 00:10:47,652
 for my sake is not my disciple

116
00:10:47,18 --> 00:10:52,18
29 It is my will that my servant Sidney Rigdon

117
00:10:52,18 --> 00:10:57,18
 shall lift up his voice in the congregations in the

118
00:10:57,18 --> 00:11:02,18
 eastern countries, in preparing the churches to

119
00:11:02,18 --> 00:11:07,18
 keep the commandments which I have given unto them

120
00:11:07,18 --> 00:11:12,18
 concerning the restoration and redemption of Zion

121
00:11:12,689 --> 00:11:18,546
30 It is my will that my servant Parley P. Pratt

122
00:11:18,546 --> 00:11:24,403
 and my servant Lyman Wight should not return to the

123
00:11:24,403 --> 00:11:30,26
 land of their brethren, until they have obtained

124
00:11:30,26 --> 00:11:36,117
 companies to go up unto the land of Zion, by tens,

125
00:11:36,117 --> 00:11:41,974
 or by twenties, or by fifties, or by an hundred,

126
00:11:41,974 --> 00:11:47,831
 until they have obtained to the number of five

127
00:11:47,831 --> 00:11:53,688
 hundred of the strength of my house

128
00:11:53,947 --> 00:12:00,447
31 Behold this is my will; ask and ye shall

129
00:12:00,447 --> 00:12:06,947
 receive; but men do not always do my will

130
00:12:06,242 --> 00:12:09,909
32 Therefore, if you cannot obtain five hundred,

131
00:12:09,909 --> 00:12:13,576
 seek diligently that peradventure you may obtain

132
00:12:13,576 --> 00:12:17,243
 three hundred

133
00:12:17,754 --> 00:12:21,087
33 And if ye cannot obtain three hundred, seek

134
00:12:21,087 --> 00:12:24,42
 diligently that peradventure ye may obtain one

135
00:12:24,42 --> 00:12:27,753
 hundred

136
00:12:27,28 --> 00:12:31,68
34 But verily I say unto you, a commandment I give

137
00:12:31,68 --> 00:12:36,08
 unto you, that ye shall not go up unto the land

138
00:12:36,08 --> 00:12:40,48
 of Zion until you have obtained a hundred of the

139
00:12:40,48 --> 00:12:44,88
 strength of my house, to go up with you unto the

140
00:12:44,88 --> 00:12:49,28
 land of Zion

141
00:12:49,552 --> 00:12:55,123
35 Therefore, as I said unto you, ask and ye shall

142
00:12:55,123 --> 00:13:00,694
 receive; pray earnestly that peradventure my

143
00:13:00,694 --> 00:13:06,265
 servant Joseph Smith, Jun., may go with you, and

144
00:13:06,265 --> 00:13:11,836
 preside in the midst of my people, and organize my

145
00:13:11,836 --> 00:13:17,407
 kingdom upon the consecrated land, and establish the

146
00:13:17,407 --> 00:13:22,978
 children of Zion upon the laws and commandments

147
00:13:22,978 --> 00:13:28,549
 which have been and which shall be given unto you

148
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:32,308
36 All victory and glory is brought to pass unto

149
00:13:32,308 --> 00:13:36,308
 you through your diligence, faithfulness, and

150
00:13:36,308 --> 00:13:40,308
 prayers of faith

151
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:45,853
37 Let my servant Parley P. Pratt journey with my

152
00:13:45,853 --> 00:13:50,853
 servant Joseph Smith, Jun

153
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:55,163
38 Let my servant Lyman Wight journey with my

154
00:13:55,163 --> 00:14:00,163
 servant Sidney Rigdon

155
00:14:00,69 --> 00:14:06,69
39 Let my servant Hyrum Smith journey with my

156
00:14:06,69 --> 00:14:12,69
 servant Frederick G. Williams

157
00:14:12,201 --> 00:14:17,034
40 Let my servant Orson Hyde journey with my

158
00:14:17,034 --> 00:14:21,867
 servant Orson Pratt, whithersoever my servant Joseph

159
00:14:21,867 --> 00:14:26,7
 Smith, Jun., shall counsel them, in obtaining the

160
00:14:26,7 --> 00:14:31,533
 fulfilment of these commandments which I have given

161
00:14:31,533 --> 00:14:36,366
 unto you, and leave the residue in my hands. Even

162
00:14:36,366 --> 00:14:41,199
 so. Amen.
