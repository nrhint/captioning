00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 103 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, February 24,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
1834. This revelation was received after the arrival

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
in Kirtland, Ohio, of Parley P. Pratt and Lyman

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Wight, who had come from Missouri to counsel with

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Prophet as to the relief and restoration of

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Saints to their lands in Jackson County.

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
1–4, Why the Lord permitted the Saints in Jackson

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
County to be persecuted; 
5–10, The Saints will

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
prevail if they keep the commandments; 
11–20, The

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
redemption of Zion will come by power, and the

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Lord will go before His people; 
21–28, The Saints

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
are to gather in Zion, and those who lay down

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
their lives will find them again; 
29–40, Various

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
brethren are called to organize Zion’s Camp and go

16
00:00:00,0 --> 02:13:49,
to Zion; they are promised victory if they are faithful. 

17
02:13:49,0 --> 02:13:49,0
1 Verily I say unto you, my friends,

18
02:13:49,0 --> 02:13:49,0
behold, I will give unto you a revelation and

19
02:13:49,0 --> 02:13:49,0
commandment, that you may know how to act in

20
02:13:49,0 --> 02:13:49,0
the discharge of your duties concerning the

21
02:13:49,0 --> 02:13:49,0
salvation and redemption of your brethren,

22
02:13:49,0 --> 02:36:50,
who have been scattered on the land of Zion;

23
02:36:50,0 --> 02:36:50,0
2 Being driven and smitten by the hands

24
02:36:50,0 --> 02:36:50,0
of mine enemies, on whom I will pour out

25
02:36:50,0 --> 02:36:28,
my wrath without measure in mine own time.

26
02:36:28,0 --> 02:36:28,0
3 For I have suffered them thus far, that

27
02:36:28,0 --> 02:36:28,0
they might fill up the measure of their

28
02:36:28,0 --> 02:32:08,
iniquities, that their cup might be full;

29
02:32:08,0 --> 02:32:08,0
4 And that those who call themselves

30
02:32:08,0 --> 02:32:08,0
after my name might be chastened for

31
02:32:08,0 --> 02:32:08,0
a little season with a sore and

32
02:32:08,0 --> 02:32:08,0
grievous chastisement, because they did

33
02:32:08,0 --> 02:32:08,0
not hearken altogether unto the

34
02:32:08,0 --> 02:37:13,
precepts and commandments which I gave unto them.

35
02:37:13,0 --> 02:37:13,0
5 But verily I say unto you, that

36
02:37:13,0 --> 02:37:13,0
I have decreed a decree which my

37
02:37:13,0 --> 02:37:13,0
people shall realize, inasmuch

38
02:37:13,0 --> 02:37:13,0
as they hearken from this very

39
02:37:13,0 --> 02:37:13,0
hour unto the counsel which I, the

40
02:37:13,0 --> 02:36:51,
Lord their God, shall give unto them.

41
02:36:51,0 --> 02:36:51,0
6 Behold they shall, for

42
02:36:51,0 --> 02:36:51,0
I have decreed it, begin

43
02:36:51,0 --> 02:36:51,0
to prevail against mine

44
02:36:51,0 --> 02:36:29,
enemies from this very hour.

45
02:36:29,0 --> 02:36:29,0
7 And by hearkening to

46
02:36:29,0 --> 02:36:29,0
observe all the words

47
02:36:29,0 --> 02:36:29,0
which I, the Lord their

48
02:36:29,0 --> 02:36:29,0
God, shall speak unto

49
02:36:29,0 --> 02:36:29,0
them, they shall never

50
02:36:29,0 --> 02:36:29,0
cease to prevail until

51
02:36:29,0 --> 02:36:29,0
the kingdoms of the

52
02:36:29,0 --> 02:36:29,0
world are subdued under my

53
02:36:29,0 --> 02:36:29,0
feet, and the earth is

54
02:36:29,0 --> 02:36:29,0
given unto the saints,

55
02:36:29,0 --> 02:32:09,
to possess it forever and ever.

56
02:32:09,0 --> 02:32:09,0
8 But inasmuch as

57
02:32:09,0 --> 02:32:09,0
they keep not my

58
02:32:09,0 --> 02:32:09,0
commandments, and hearken

59
02:32:09,0 --> 02:32:09,0
not to observe all

60
02:32:09,0 --> 02:32:09,0
my words, the

61
02:32:09,0 --> 02:32:09,0
kingdoms of the world

62
02:32:09,0 --> 02:37:14,
shall prevail against them.

63
02:37:14,0 --> 02:37:14,0
9 For they were set

64
02:37:14,0 --> 02:37:14,0
to be a light unto

65
02:37:14,0 --> 02:37:14,0
the world, and to

66
02:37:14,0 --> 02:36:52,
be the saviors of men;

67
02:36:52,0 --> 02:36:52,0
10 And inasmuch

68
02:36:52,0 --> 02:36:52,0
as they are not

69
02:36:52,0 --> 02:36:52,0
the saviors of men,

70
02:36:52,0 --> 02:36:52,0
they are as salt

71
02:36:52,0 --> 02:36:52,0
that has lost

72
02:36:52,0 --> 02:36:52,0
its savor, and is

73
02:36:52,0 --> 02:36:52,0
thenceforth good

74
02:36:52,0 --> 02:36:52,0
for nothing but to

75
02:36:52,0 --> 02:36:52,0
be cast out and

76
02:36:52,0 --> 02:36:30,
trodden under foot of men.

77
02:36:30,0 --> 02:36:30,0
11 But verily I

78
02:36:30,0 --> 02:36:30,0
say unto you, I

79
02:36:30,0 --> 02:36:30,0
have decreed

80
02:36:30,0 --> 02:36:30,0
that your brethren

81
02:36:30,0 --> 02:36:30,0
which have been

82
02:36:30,0 --> 02:36:30,0
scattered shall

83
02:36:30,0 --> 02:36:30,0
return to the

84
02:36:30,0 --> 02:36:30,0
lands of their

85
02:36:30,0 --> 02:36:30,0
inheritances, and

86
02:36:30,0 --> 02:36:30,0
shall build up

87
02:36:30,0 --> 02:32:10,
the waste places of Zion.

88
02:32:10,0 --> 02:32:10,0
12 For after

89
02:32:10,0 --> 02:32:10,0
much

90
02:32:10,0 --> 02:32:10,0
tribulation, as I have

91
02:32:10,0 --> 02:32:10,0
said unto you

92
02:32:10,0 --> 02:32:10,0
in a former

93
02:32:10,0 --> 02:32:10,0
commandment,

94
02:32:10,0 --> 02:37:15,
cometh the blessing.

95
02:37:15,0 --> 02:37:15,0
13 Behold,

96
02:37:15,0 --> 02:37:15,0
this is the

97
02:37:15,0 --> 02:37:15,0
blessing which I

98
02:37:15,0 --> 02:37:15,0
have

99
02:37:15,0 --> 02:37:15,0
promised after your

100
02:37:15,0 --> 02:37:15,0
tribulations,

101
02:37:15,0 --> 02:37:15,0
and the

102
02:37:15,0 --> 02:37:15,0
tribulations of

103
02:37:15,0 --> 02:37:15,0
your

104
02:37:15,0 --> 02:37:15,0
brethren—your

105
02:37:15,0 --> 02:37:15,0
redemption, and the

106
02:37:15,0 --> 02:37:15,0
redemption of

107
02:37:15,0 --> 02:37:15,0
your

108
02:37:15,0 --> 02:37:15,0
brethren, even their

109
02:37:15,0 --> 02:37:15,0
restoration

110
02:37:15,0 --> 02:37:15,0
to the land of

111
02:37:15,0 --> 02:37:15,0
Zion, to be

112
02:37:15,0 --> 02:37:15,0
established,

113
02:37:15,0 --> 02:36:53,
no more to be thrown down.

114
02:36:53,0 --> 02:36:53,0
14

115
02:36:53,0 --> 02:36:53,0
Nevertheless, if they

116
02:36:53,0 --> 02:36:53,0
pollute

117
02:36:53,0 --> 02:36:53,0
their

118
02:36:53,0 --> 02:36:53,0
inheritances they

119
02:36:53,0 --> 02:36:53,0
shall be thrown

120
02:36:53,0 --> 02:36:53,0
down; for I

121
02:36:53,0 --> 02:36:53,0
will not

122
02:36:53,0 --> 02:36:53,0
spare them if

123
02:36:53,0 --> 02:36:53,0
they pollute

124
02:36:53,0 --> 02:36:31,
their inheritances.

125
02:36:31,0 --> 02:36:31,0
15 Behold,

126
02:36:31,0 --> 02:36:31,0
I say

127
02:36:31,0 --> 02:36:31,0
unto you, the

128
02:36:31,0 --> 02:36:31,0


129
02:36:31,0 --> 02:36:31,0
redemption of Zion

130
02:36:31,0 --> 02:36:31,0
must needs

131
02:36:31,0 --> 02:32:11,
come by power;

132
02:32:11,0 --> 02:32:11,0
16

133
02:32:11,0 --> 02:32:11,0
Therefore, I

134
02:32:11,0 --> 02:32:11,0
will raise

135
02:32:11,0 --> 02:32:11,0
up unto

136
02:32:11,0 --> 02:32:11,0
my people

137
02:32:11,0 --> 02:32:11,0
a man,

138
02:32:11,0 --> 02:32:11,0
who shall

139
02:32:11,0 --> 02:32:11,0
lead them

140
02:32:11,0 --> 02:32:11,0
like as

141
02:32:11,0 --> 02:32:11,0
Moses led

142
02:32:11,0 --> 02:32:11,0
the

143
02:32:11,0 --> 02:37:16,
children of Israel.

144
02:37:16,0 --> 02:37:16,0
17 For

145
02:37:16,0 --> 02:37:16,0
ye are

146
02:37:16,0 --> 02:37:16,0
the

147
02:37:16,0 --> 02:37:16,0
children of

148
02:37:16,0 --> 02:37:16,0
Israel,

149
02:37:16,0 --> 02:37:16,0
and of the

150
02:37:16,0 --> 02:37:16,0
seed of

151
02:37:16,0 --> 02:37:16,0


152
02:37:16,0 --> 02:37:16,0
Abraham, and ye

153
02:37:16,0 --> 02:37:16,0
must

154
02:37:16,0 --> 02:37:16,0
needs be

155
02:37:16,0 --> 02:37:16,0
led out

156
02:37:16,0 --> 02:37:16,0
of

157
02:37:16,0 --> 02:37:16,0
bondage by

158
02:37:16,0 --> 02:37:16,0
power, and

159
02:37:16,0 --> 02:37:16,0
with a

160
02:37:16,0 --> 02:36:54,
stretched-out arm.

161
02:36:54,0 --> 02:36:54,0
18 And

162
02:36:54,0 --> 02:36:54,0
as your

163
02:36:54,0 --> 02:36:54,0


164
02:36:54,0 --> 02:36:54,0
fathers were

165
02:36:54,0 --> 02:36:54,0
led at

166
02:36:54,0 --> 02:36:54,0
the

167
02:36:54,0 --> 02:36:54,0
first,

168
02:36:54,0 --> 02:36:54,0
even so

169
02:36:54,0 --> 02:36:54,0
shall the

170
02:36:54,0 --> 02:36:54,0


171
02:36:54,0 --> 02:36:32,
redemption of Zion be.

172
02:36:32,0 --> 02:36:32,0
19

173
02:36:32,0 --> 02:36:32,0


174
02:36:32,0 --> 02:36:32,0
Therefore, let

175
02:36:32,0 --> 02:36:32,0
not

176
02:36:32,0 --> 02:36:32,0
your

177
02:36:32,0 --> 02:36:32,0
hearts

178
02:36:32,0 --> 02:36:32,0
faint,

179
02:36:32,0 --> 02:36:32,0
for I

180
02:36:32,0 --> 02:36:32,0
say not

181
02:36:32,0 --> 02:36:32,0
unto

182
02:36:32,0 --> 02:36:32,0
you as

183
02:36:32,0 --> 02:36:32,0
I

184
02:36:32,0 --> 02:36:32,0
said unto

185
02:36:32,0 --> 02:36:32,0
your

186
02:36:32,0 --> 02:36:32,0


187
02:36:32,0 --> 02:36:32,0
fathers:

188
02:36:32,0 --> 02:36:32,0
Mine

189
02:36:32,0 --> 02:36:32,0
angel

190
02:36:32,0 --> 02:36:32,0
shall go

191
02:36:32,0 --> 02:36:32,0
up

192
02:36:32,0 --> 02:36:32,0
before

193
02:36:32,0 --> 02:40:10,
you, but not my presence.

194
02:40:10,0 --> 02:40:10,0
20 But

195
02:40:10,0 --> 02:40:10,0
I say

196
02:40:10,0 --> 02:40:10,0
unto

197
02:40:10,0 --> 02:40:10,0
you:

198
02:40:10,0 --> 02:40:10,0
Mine

199
02:40:10,0 --> 02:40:10,0
angels

200
02:40:10,0 --> 02:40:10,0
shall

201
02:40:10,0 --> 02:40:10,0
go up

202
02:40:10,0 --> 02:40:10,0
before

203
02:40:10,0 --> 02:40:10,0
you,

204
02:40:10,0 --> 02:40:10,0
and

205
02:40:10,0 --> 02:40:10,0
also my

206
02:40:10,0 --> 02:40:10,0


207
02:40:10,0 --> 02:40:10,0
presence, and

208
02:40:10,0 --> 02:40:10,0
in

209
02:40:10,0 --> 02:40:10,0
time ye

210
02:40:10,0 --> 02:40:10,0
shall

211
02:40:10,0 --> 02:40:10,0


212
02:40:10,0 --> 02:40:10,0
possess the

213
02:40:10,0 --> 02:40:10,0
goodly

214
02:40:10,0 --> 02:52:16,
land.

215
02:52:16,0 --> 02:52:16,0
21

216
02:52:16,0 --> 02:52:16,0
Verily,

217
02:52:16,0 --> 02:52:16,0


218
02:52:16,0 --> 02:52:16,0
verily I

219
02:52:16,0 --> 02:52:16,0
say

220
02:52:16,0 --> 02:52:16,0
unto

221
02:52:16,0 --> 02:52:16,0
you,

222
02:52:16,0 --> 02:52:16,0
that

223
02:52:16,0 --> 02:52:16,0
my

224
