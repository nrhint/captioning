00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:18,056
Section 46 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:18,056 --> 00:00:24,834
 the Prophet to the Church, at Kirtland, Ohio, March

3
00:00:24,834 --> 00:00:31,612
 8, 1831. In this early time of the Church, a

4
00:00:31,612 --> 00:00:38,39
 unified pattern for the conducting of Church services

5
00:00:38,39 --> 00:00:45,168
 had not yet developed. However, a custom of

6
00:00:45,168 --> 00:00:51,946
 admitting only members and earnest investigators to the

7
00:00:51,946 --> 00:00:58,724
 sacrament meetings and other assemblies of the

8
00:00:58,724 --> 00:01:05,502
 Church had become somewhat general. This revelation

9
00:01:05,502 --> 00:01:12,28
 expresses the will of the Lord relative to

10
00:01:12,28 --> 00:01:19,058
 governing and conducting meetings and His direction on

11
00:01:19,058 --> 00:01:25,836
 seeking and discerning the gifts of the Spirit. 
1–2,

12
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:32,614
 Elders are to conduct meetings as guided by the

13
00:01:32,614 --> 00:01:39,392
 Holy Spirit; 
3–6, Truth seekers should not be

14
00:01:39,392 --> 00:01:46,17
 excluded from sacramental services; 
7–12, Ask of God

15
00:01:46,17 --> 00:01:52,948
 and seek the gifts of the Spirit; 
13–26, An

16
00:01:52,948 --> 00:01:59,726
 enumeration of some of these gifts is given; 
27–33,

17
00:01:59,726 --> 00:02:06,504
 Church leaders are given power to discern the gifts

18
00:02:06,504 --> 00:02:13,282
 of the Spirit.

19
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:18,05
1 Hearken, O ye people of my church; for verily I

20
00:02:18,05 --> 00:02:22,717
 say unto you that these things were spoken unto

21
00:02:22,717 --> 00:02:27,384
 you for your profit and learning

22
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:32,614
2 But notwithstanding those things which are

23
00:02:32,614 --> 00:02:37,814
 written, it always has been given to the elders of my

24
00:02:37,814 --> 00:02:43,014
 church from the beginning, and ever shall be, to

25
00:02:43,014 --> 00:02:48,214
 conduct all meetings as they are directed and guided

26
00:02:48,214 --> 00:02:53,414
 by the Holy Spirit

27
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:58,924
3 Nevertheless ye are commanded never to cast any

28
00:02:58,924 --> 00:03:03,924
 one out from your public meetings, which are held

29
00:03:03,924 --> 00:03:08,924
 before the world

30
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:15,672
4 Ye are also commanded not to cast any one who

31
00:03:15,672 --> 00:03:22,422
 belongeth to the church out of your sacrament

32
00:03:22,422 --> 00:03:29,172
 meetings; nevertheless, if any have trespassed, let him

33
00:03:29,172 --> 00:03:35,922
 not partake until he makes reconciliation

34
00:03:35,932 --> 00:03:40,932
5 And again I say unto you, ye shall not cast any

35
00:03:40,932 --> 00:03:45,932
 out of your sacrament meetings who are earnestly

36
00:03:45,932 --> 00:03:50,932
 seeking the kingdom—I speak this concerning those

37
00:03:50,932 --> 00:03:55,932
 who are not of the church

38
00:03:55,435 --> 00:04:00,935
6 And again I say unto you, concerning your

39
00:04:00,935 --> 00:04:06,435
 confirmation meetings, that if there be any that are not

40
00:04:06,435 --> 00:04:11,935
 of the church, that are earnestly seeking after

41
00:04:11,935 --> 00:04:17,435
 the kingdom, ye shall not cast them out

42
00:04:17,707 --> 00:04:23,596
7 But ye are commanded in all things to ask of

43
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:29,485
 God, who giveth liberally; and that which the Spirit

44
00:04:29,485 --> 00:04:35,374
 testifies unto you even so I would that ye should

45
00:04:35,374 --> 00:04:41,263
 do in all holiness of heart, walking uprightly

46
00:04:41,263 --> 00:04:47,152
 before me, considering the end of your salvation,

47
00:04:47,152 --> 00:04:53,041
 doing all things with prayer and thanksgiving, that

48
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:58,93
 ye may not be seduced by evil spirits, or doctrines

49
00:04:58,93 --> 00:05:04,819
 of devils, or the commandments of men; for some

50
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:10,708
 are of men, and others of devils

51
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:16,294
8 Wherefore, beware lest ye are deceived; and that

52
00:05:16,294 --> 00:05:22,044
 ye may not be deceived seek ye earnestly the best

53
00:05:22,044 --> 00:05:27,794
 gifts, always remembering for what they are

54
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:33,544
 given

55
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:39,7
9 For verily I say unto you, they are given for

56
00:05:39,7 --> 00:05:45,867
 the benefit of those who love me and keep all my

57
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:52,034
 commandments, and him that seeketh so to do; that all

58
00:05:52,034 --> 00:05:58,201
 may be benefited that seek or that ask of me,

59
00:05:58,201 --> 00:06:04,368
 that ask and not for a sign that they may consume it

60
00:06:04,368 --> 00:06:10,535
 upon their lusts

61
00:06:10,52 --> 00:06:14,77
10 And again, verily I say unto you, I would that

62
00:06:14,77 --> 00:06:19,02
 ye should always remember, and always retain in

63
00:06:19,02 --> 00:06:23,27
 your minds what those gifts are, that are given unto

64
00:06:23,27 --> 00:06:27,52
 the church

65
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:35,821
11 For all have not every gift given unto them;

66
00:06:35,821 --> 00:06:43,821
 for there are many gifts, and to every man is given

67
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:51,821
 a gift by the Spirit of God

68
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:57,561
12 To some is given one, and to some is given

69
00:06:57,561 --> 00:07:03,561
 another, that all may be profited thereby

70
00:07:03,59 --> 00:07:10,257
13 To some it is given by the Holy Ghost to know

71
00:07:10,257 --> 00:07:16,924
 that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and that he

72
00:07:16,924 --> 00:07:23,591
 was crucified for the sins of the world

73
00:07:23,093 --> 00:07:28,093
14 To others it is given to believe on their

74
00:07:28,093 --> 00:07:33,093
 words, that they also might have eternal life if they

75
00:07:33,093 --> 00:07:38,093
 continue faithful

76
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:45,191
15 And again, to some it is given by the Holy

77
00:07:45,191 --> 00:07:51,791
 Ghost to know the differences of administration, as it

78
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:58,391
 will be pleasing unto the same Lord, according as

79
00:07:58,391 --> 00:08:04,991
 the Lord will, suiting his mercies according to

80
00:08:04,991 --> 00:08:11,591
 the conditions of the children of men

81
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:17,641
16 And again, it is given by the Holy Ghost to

82
00:08:17,641 --> 00:08:23,891
 some to know the diversities of operations, whether

83
00:08:23,891 --> 00:08:30,141
 they be of God, that the manifestations of the

84
00:08:30,141 --> 00:08:36,391
 Spirit may be given to every man to profit withal

85
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:41,399
17 And again, verily I say unto you, to some is

86
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:46,399
 given, by the Spirit of God, the word of wisdom

87
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:50,593
18 To another is given the word of knowledge, that

88
00:08:50,593 --> 00:08:54,26
 all may be taught to be wise and to have

89
00:08:54,26 --> 00:08:57,927
 knowledge

90
00:08:57,22 --> 00:09:00,72
19 And again, to some it is given to have faith to

91
00:09:00,72 --> 00:09:04,22
 be healed

92
00:09:04,494 --> 00:09:07,994
20 And to others it is given to have faith to

93
00:09:07,994 --> 00:09:11,494
 heal

94
00:09:11,768 --> 00:09:14,768
21 And again, to some is given the working of

95
00:09:14,768 --> 00:09:17,768
 miracles

96
00:09:17,774 --> 00:09:23,774
22 And to others it is given to prophesy

97
00:09:23,78 --> 00:09:30,78
23 And to others the discerning of spirits

98
00:09:30,07 --> 00:09:33,07
24 And again, it is given to some to speak with

99
00:09:33,07 --> 00:09:36,07
 tongues

100
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:39,843
25 And to another is given the interpretation of

101
00:09:39,843 --> 00:09:42,843
 tongues

102
00:09:42,132 --> 00:09:47,632
26 And all these gifts come from God, for the

103
00:09:47,632 --> 00:09:53,132
 benefit of the children of God

104
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:59,726
27 And unto the bishop of the church, and unto

105
00:09:59,726 --> 00:10:05,559
 such as God shall appoint and ordain to watch over

106
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:11,392
 the church and to be elders unto the church, are to

107
00:10:11,392 --> 00:10:17,225
 have it given unto them to discern all those gifts

108
00:10:17,225 --> 00:10:23,058
 lest there shall be any among you professing and

109
00:10:23,058 --> 00:10:28,891
 yet be not of God

110
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:33,161
28 And it shall come to pass that he that asketh

111
00:10:33,161 --> 00:10:38,161
 in Spirit shall receive in Spirit

112
00:10:38,688 --> 00:10:44,355
29 That unto some it may be given to have all

113
00:10:44,355 --> 00:10:50,022
 those gifts, that there may be a head, in order that

114
00:10:50,022 --> 00:10:55,689
 every member may be profited thereby

115
00:10:55,972 --> 00:11:01,305
30 He that asketh in the Spirit asketh according

116
00:11:01,305 --> 00:11:06,638
 to the will of God; wherefore it is done even as he

117
00:11:06,638 --> 00:11:11,971
 asketh

118
00:11:11,721 --> 00:11:15,721
31 And again, I say unto you, all things must be

119
00:11:15,721 --> 00:11:19,721
 done in the name of Christ, whatsoever you do in

120
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:23,721
 the Spirit

121
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:28,483
32 And ye must give thanks unto God in the Spirit

122
00:11:28,483 --> 00:11:33,483
 for whatsoever blessing ye are blessed with

123
00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:38,509
33 And ye must practice virtue and holiness before

124
00:11:38,509 --> 00:11:44,009
 me continually. Even so. Amen.
