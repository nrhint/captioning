00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 46 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Prophet to the Church, at Kirtland, Ohio,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
March 8, 1831. In this early time of the Church,

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
a unified pattern for the conducting of Church

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
services had not yet developed. However, a custom

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of admitting only members and earnest

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
investigators to the sacrament meetings and other

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
assemblies of the Church had become somewhat general.

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
This revelation expresses the will of the Lord

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
relative to governing and conducting meetings and

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
His direction on seeking and discerning the

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
gifts of the Spirit. 
1–2, Elders are to conduct

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
meetings as guided by the Holy Spirit; 
3–6, Truth

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
seekers should not be excluded from sacramental

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
services; 
7–12, Ask of God and seek the gifts

16
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of the Spirit; 
13–26, An enumeration of some of

17
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
these gifts is given; 
27–33, Church leaders are

18
00:00:00,0 --> 02:12:49,
given power to discern the gifts of the Spirit. 

19
02:12:49,0 --> 02:12:49,0
1 Hearken, O ye people of my church; for

20
02:12:49,0 --> 02:12:49,0
verily I say unto you that these things were

21
02:12:49,0 --> 02:23:50,
spoken unto you for your profit and learning.

22
02:23:50,0 --> 02:23:50,0
2 But notwithstanding those things

23
02:23:50,0 --> 02:23:50,0
which are written, it always has been

24
02:23:50,0 --> 02:23:50,0
given to the elders of my church

25
02:23:50,0 --> 02:23:50,0
from the beginning, and ever shall be,

26
02:23:50,0 --> 02:23:50,0
to conduct all meetings as they are

27
02:23:50,0 --> 02:26:52,
directed and guided by the Holy Spirit.

28
02:26:52,0 --> 02:26:52,0
3 Nevertheless ye are

29
02:26:52,0 --> 02:26:52,0
commanded never to cast any one out

30
02:26:52,0 --> 02:26:52,0
from your public meetings,

31
02:26:52,0 --> 02:33:54,
which are held before the world.

32
02:33:54,0 --> 02:33:54,0
4 Ye are also commanded not

33
02:33:54,0 --> 02:33:54,0
to cast any one who

34
02:33:54,0 --> 02:33:54,0
belongeth to the church out of

35
02:33:54,0 --> 02:33:54,0
your sacrament meetings;

36
02:33:54,0 --> 02:33:54,0
nevertheless, if any have

37
02:33:54,0 --> 02:33:54,0
trespassed, let him not partake

38
02:33:54,0 --> 02:53:31,
until he makes reconciliation.

39
02:53:31,0 --> 02:53:31,0
5 And again I say unto

40
02:53:31,0 --> 02:53:31,0
you, ye shall not cast any

41
02:53:31,0 --> 02:53:31,0
out of your sacrament

42
02:53:31,0 --> 02:53:31,0
meetings who are earnestly

43
02:53:31,0 --> 02:53:31,0
seeking the kingdom—I

44
02:53:31,0 --> 02:53:31,0
speak this concerning those

45
02:53:31,0 --> 02:55:35,
who are not of the church.

46
02:55:35,0 --> 02:55:35,0
6 And again I say unto

47
02:55:35,0 --> 02:55:35,0
you, concerning your

48
02:55:35,0 --> 02:55:35,0
confirmation meetings,

49
02:55:35,0 --> 02:55:35,0
that if there be any that

50
02:55:35,0 --> 02:55:35,0
are not of the church,

51
02:55:35,0 --> 02:55:35,0
that are earnestly

52
02:55:35,0 --> 02:55:35,0
seeking after the kingdom,

53
02:55:35,0 --> 03:08:11,
ye shall not cast them out.

54
03:08:11,0 --> 03:08:11,0
7 But ye are commanded

55
03:08:11,0 --> 03:08:11,0
in all things to ask

56
03:08:11,0 --> 03:08:11,0
of God, who giveth

57
03:08:11,0 --> 03:08:11,0
liberally; and that which

58
03:08:11,0 --> 03:08:11,0
the Spirit testifies

59
03:08:11,0 --> 03:08:11,0
unto you even so I

60
03:08:11,0 --> 03:08:11,0
would that ye should do

61
03:08:11,0 --> 03:08:11,0
in all holiness of

62
03:08:11,0 --> 03:08:11,0
heart, walking uprightly

63
03:08:11,0 --> 03:08:11,0
before me, considering

64
03:08:11,0 --> 03:08:11,0
the end of your

65
03:08:11,0 --> 03:08:11,0
salvation, doing all things

66
03:08:11,0 --> 03:08:11,0
with prayer and

67
03:08:11,0 --> 03:08:11,0
thanksgiving, that ye may

68
03:08:11,0 --> 03:08:11,0
not be seduced by evil

69
03:08:11,0 --> 03:08:11,0
spirits, or doctrines

70
03:08:11,0 --> 03:08:11,0
of devils, or the

71
03:08:11,0 --> 03:08:11,0
commandments of men; for

72
03:08:11,0 --> 03:33:44,
some are of men, and others of devils.

73
03:33:44,0 --> 03:33:44,0
8 Wherefore, beware

74
03:33:44,0 --> 03:33:44,0
lest ye are deceived;

75
03:33:44,0 --> 03:33:44,0
and that ye may not

76
03:33:44,0 --> 03:33:44,0
be deceived seek ye

77
03:33:44,0 --> 03:33:44,0
earnestly the best

78
03:33:44,0 --> 03:33:44,0
gifts, always remembering

79
03:33:44,0 --> 03:34:48,
for what they are given;

80
03:34:48,0 --> 03:34:48,0
9 For verily I say

81
03:34:48,0 --> 03:34:48,0
unto you, they are

82
03:34:48,0 --> 03:34:48,0
given for the benefit

83
03:34:48,0 --> 03:34:48,0
of those who love me

84
03:34:48,0 --> 03:34:48,0
and keep all my

85
03:34:48,0 --> 03:34:48,0
commandments, and him

86
03:34:48,0 --> 03:34:48,0
that seeketh so to

87
03:34:48,0 --> 03:34:48,0
do; that all may be

88
03:34:48,0 --> 03:34:48,0
benefited that seek or

89
03:34:48,0 --> 03:34:48,0
that ask of me,

90
03:34:48,0 --> 03:34:48,0
that ask and not for a

91
03:34:48,0 --> 03:34:48,0
sign that they may

92
03:34:48,0 --> 03:51:50,
consume it upon their lusts.

93
03:51:50,0 --> 03:51:50,0
10 And again,

94
03:51:50,0 --> 03:51:50,0
verily I say unto you,

95
03:51:50,0 --> 03:51:50,0
I would that ye

96
03:51:50,0 --> 03:51:50,0
should always

97
03:51:50,0 --> 03:51:50,0
remember, and always

98
03:51:50,0 --> 03:51:50,0
retain in your minds

99
03:51:50,0 --> 03:51:50,0
what those gifts

100
03:51:50,0 --> 03:51:50,0
are, that are

101
03:51:50,0 --> 03:50:54,
given unto the church.

102
03:50:54,0 --> 03:50:54,0
11 For all have

103
03:50:54,0 --> 03:50:54,0
not every gift

104
03:50:54,0 --> 03:50:54,0
given unto them;

105
03:50:54,0 --> 03:50:54,0
for there are

106
03:50:54,0 --> 03:50:54,0
many gifts, and to

107
03:50:54,0 --> 03:50:54,0
every man is

108
03:50:54,0 --> 03:50:54,0
given a gift by

109
03:50:54,0 --> 03:53:56,
the Spirit of God.

110
03:53:56,0 --> 03:53:56,0
12 To some is

111
03:53:56,0 --> 03:53:56,0
given one, and

112
03:53:56,0 --> 03:53:56,0
to some is

113
03:53:56,0 --> 03:53:56,0
given another,

114
03:53:56,0 --> 03:53:56,0
that all may be

115
03:53:56,0 --> 03:57:35,
profited thereby.

116
03:57:35,0 --> 03:57:35,0
13 To some it

117
03:57:35,0 --> 03:57:35,0
is given by

118
03:57:35,0 --> 03:57:35,0
the Holy

119

Ghost to know

Christ is the Son

122
03:57:35,0 --> 03:57:35,0
of God, and

123
03:57:35,0 --> 03:57:35,0
that he was

124
03:57:35,0 --> 03:57:35,0
crucified for

125
03:57:35,0 --> 04:04:37,
the sins of the world.

126
04:04:37,0 --> 04:04:37,0
14 To others

04:04:37,0 --> 04:04:37,0
that they

131
04:04:37,0 --> 04:04:37,0

04:04:37,0 --> 04:04:37,0
eternal life

133
04:04:37,0 --> 04:04:37,0

15 And

04:16:43,0 --> 04:16:43,0
the

141
04:16:43,0 --> 04:16:43,0
differences of

142
04:16:43,0 --> 04:16:43,0
administration,

143
04:16:43,0 --> 04:16:43,0
as it will be

04:16:43,0 --> 04:16:43,0
Lord,

04:16:43,0 --> 04:16:43,0
according as the

148
04:16:43,0 --> 04:16:43,0
Lord will,

05:09:42,0 --> 05:09:42,0
diversities

161
05:09:42,0 --> 05:09:42,0
