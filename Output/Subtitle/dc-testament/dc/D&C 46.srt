00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:07,333
Section 46 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:14,666
the Prophet to the Church, at Kirtland, Ohio,

3
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:21,999
March 8, 1831. In this early time of the Church,

4
00:00:21,999 --> 00:00:29,332
a unified pattern for the conducting of Church

5
00:00:29,332 --> 00:00:36,665
services had not yet developed. However, a custom

6
00:00:36,665 --> 00:00:43,998
of admitting only members and earnest

7
00:00:43,998 --> 00:00:51,331
investigators to the sacrament meetings and other

8
00:00:51,331 --> 00:00:58,664
assemblies of the Church had become somewhat general.

9
00:00:58,664 --> 00:01:05,997
This revelation expresses the will of the Lord

10
00:01:05,997 --> 00:01:13,33
relative to governing and conducting meetings and

11
00:01:13,33 --> 00:01:20,663
His direction on seeking and discerning the

12
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:27,996
gifts of the Spirit. 
1–2, Elders are to conduct

13
00:01:27,996 --> 00:01:35,329
meetings as guided by the Holy Spirit; 
3–6, Truth

14
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:42,662
seekers should not be excluded from sacramental

15
00:01:42,662 --> 00:01:49,995
services; 
7–12, Ask of God and seek the gifts

16
00:01:49,995 --> 00:01:57,328
of the Spirit; 
13–26, An enumeration of some of

17
00:01:57,328 --> 00:02:04,661
these gifts is given; 
27–33, Church leaders are

18
00:02:04,661 --> 00:02:12,949
given power to discern the gifts of the Spirit. 

19
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:13,616
1 Hearken, O ye people of my church; for

20
00:02:13,616 --> 00:02:14,283
verily I say unto you that these things were

21
00:02:14,283 --> 00:02:14,017
spoken unto you for your profit and learning.

22
00:02:14,017 --> 00:02:15,184
2 But notwithstanding those things

23
00:02:15,184 --> 00:02:16,351
which are written, it always has been

24
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:17,518
given to the elders of my church

25
00:02:17,518 --> 00:02:18,685
from the beginning, and ever shall be,

26
00:02:18,685 --> 00:02:19,852
to conduct all meetings as they are

27
00:02:19,852 --> 00:02:21,058
directed and guided by the Holy Spirit.

28
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:22,058
3 Nevertheless ye are

29
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,058
commanded never to cast any one out

30
00:02:23,058 --> 00:02:24,058
from your public meetings,

31
00:02:24,058 --> 00:02:25,178
which are held before the world.

32
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:25,035
4 Ye are also commanded not

33
00:02:25,035 --> 00:02:24,892
to cast any one who

34
00:02:24,892 --> 00:02:24,749
belongeth to the church out of

35
00:02:24,749 --> 00:02:24,606
your sacrament meetings;

36
00:02:24,606 --> 00:02:24,463
nevertheless, if any have

37
00:02:24,463 --> 00:02:24,32
trespassed, let him not partake

38
00:02:24,32 --> 00:02:24,811
until he makes reconciliation.

39
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:24,811
5 And again I say unto

40
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:24,811
you, ye shall not cast any

41
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:24,811
out of your sacrament

42
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:24,811
meetings who are earnestly

43
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:24,811
seeking the kingdom—I

44
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:24,811
speak this concerning those

45
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:24,911
who are not of the church.

46
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:25,036
6 And again I say unto

47
00:02:25,036 --> 00:02:25,161
you, concerning your

48
00:02:25,161 --> 00:02:25,286
confirmation meetings,

49
00:02:25,286 --> 00:02:25,411
that if there be any that

50
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:25,536
are not of the church,

51
00:02:25,536 --> 00:02:25,661
that are earnestly

52
00:02:25,661 --> 00:02:25,786
seeking after the kingdom,

53
00:02:25,786 --> 00:02:25,012
ye shall not cast them out.

54
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:25,012
7 But ye are commanded

55
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:25,012
in all things to ask

56
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:25,012
of God, who giveth

57
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:25,012
liberally; and that which

58
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:25,012
the Spirit testifies

59
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:25,012
unto you even so I

60
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:25,012
would that ye should do

61
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:25,012
in all holiness of

62
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:25,012
heart, walking uprightly

63
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:25,012
before me, considering

64
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:25,012
the end of your

65
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:25,012
salvation, doing all things

66
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:25,012
with prayer and

67
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:25,012
thanksgiving, that ye may

68
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:25,012
not be seduced by evil

69
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:25,012
spirits, or doctrines

70
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:25,012
of devils, or the

71
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:25,012
commandments of men; for

72
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:25,112
some are of men, and others of devils.

73
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:24,969
8 Wherefore, beware

74
00:02:24,969 --> 00:02:24,826
lest ye are deceived;

75
00:02:24,826 --> 00:02:24,683
and that ye may not

76
00:02:24,683 --> 00:02:24,54
be deceived seek ye

77
00:02:24,54 --> 00:02:24,397
earnestly the best

78
00:02:24,397 --> 00:02:24,254
gifts, always remembering

79
00:02:24,254 --> 00:02:24,745
for what they are given;

80
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:24,591
9 For verily I say

81
00:02:24,591 --> 00:02:24,437
unto you, they are

82
00:02:24,437 --> 00:02:24,283
given for the benefit

83
00:02:24,283 --> 00:02:24,129
of those who love me

84
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:23,975
and keep all my

85
00:02:23,975 --> 00:02:23,821
commandments, and him

86
00:02:23,821 --> 00:02:23,667
that seeketh so to

87
00:02:23,667 --> 00:02:23,513
do; that all may be

88
00:02:23,513 --> 00:02:23,359
benefited that seek or

89
00:02:23,359 --> 00:02:23,205
that ask of me,

90
00:02:23,205 --> 00:02:23,051
that ask and not for a

91
00:02:23,051 --> 00:02:22,897
sign that they may

92
00:02:22,897 --> 00:02:22,843
consume it upon their lusts.

93
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:23,287
10 And again,

94
00:02:23,287 --> 00:02:23,731
verily I say unto you,

95
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:24,175
I would that ye

96
00:02:24,175 --> 00:02:24,619
should always

97
00:02:24,619 --> 00:02:25,063
remember, and always

98
00:02:25,063 --> 00:02:25,507
retain in your minds

99
00:02:25,507 --> 00:02:25,951
what those gifts

100
00:02:25,951 --> 00:02:26,395
are, that are

101
00:02:26,395 --> 00:02:26,963
given unto the church.

102
00:02:26,963 --> 00:02:29,088
11 For all have

103
00:02:29,088 --> 00:02:31,213
not every gift

104
00:02:31,213 --> 00:02:33,338
given unto them;

105
00:02:33,338 --> 00:02:35,463
for there are

106
00:02:35,463 --> 00:02:37,588
many gifts, and to

107
00:02:37,588 --> 00:02:39,713
every man is

108
00:02:39,713 --> 00:02:41,838
given a gift by

109
00:02:41,838 --> 00:02:43,997
the Spirit of God.

110
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,664
12 To some is

111
00:02:45,664 --> 00:02:47,331
given one, and

112
00:02:47,331 --> 00:02:48,998

00:02:48,998 --> 00:02:50,665
given another,

114
00:02:50,665 --> 00:02:52,332
that all may be

115
00:02:52,332 --> 00:02:53,056
profited thereby.

116
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,556
13 To some it

of God, and

123
00:03:03,556 --> 00:03:05,056
that he was

124
00:03:05,056 --> 00:03:06,556
crucified for

125
00:03:06,556 --> 00:03:08,105
the sins of the world.

126
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:10,216
14 To others

128
00:03:12,327 --> 00:03:14,438
to believe on

129
00:03:14,438 --> 00:03:16,549
their words,

130
00:03:16,549 --> 00:03:18,66
that they

131
00:03:18,66 --> 00:03:20,771

eternal life

133
00:03:22,882 --> 00:03:24,993
if they

134
00:03:24,993 --> 00:03:27,107
continue faithful.

135
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:27,37
15 And

136
00:03:27,37 --> 00:03:27,633
again, to some it

137
00:03:27,633 --> 00:03:27,896

00:03:28,685 --> 00:03:28,948
differences of

142
00:03:28,948 --> 00:03:29,211
administration,

143
00:03:29,211 --> 00:03:29,474
as it will be

144
00:03:29,474 --> 00:03:29,737

145
00:03:29,737 --> 00:03:29,0
unto the same

according as the

148
00:03:30,526 --> 00:03:30,789
Lord will,

149
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:31,052
suiting his

00:03:31,052 --> 00:03:31,315

conditions of

153
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:32,195
the children of men.

154
00:03:32,195 --> 00:03:31,901
16 And

155
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:31,607
again, it is

156
00:03:31,607 --> 00:03:31,313
given by the

157
00:03:31,313 --> 00:03:31,019
Holy Ghost

158
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:30,725
to some to

160
00:03:30,431 --> 00:03:30,137
diversities

161
00:03:30,137 --> 00:03:29,843

162
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:29,549
operations, whether

163
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:29,255
they be of

164
00:03:29,255 --> 00:03:28,961
God, that
