1
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:18,581
Section 124 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:18,581 --> 00:00:25,884
 Prophet, at Nauvoo, Illinois, January 19, 1841.

3
00:00:25,884 --> 00:00:33,187
 Because of increasing persecutions and illegal

4
00:00:33,187 --> 00:00:40,49
 procedures against them by public officers, the Saints

5
00:00:40,49 --> 00:00:47,793
 had been compelled to leave Missouri. The

6
00:00:47,793 --> 00:00:55,096
 exterminating order issued by Lilburn W. Boggs, governor of

7
00:00:55,096 --> 00:01:02,399
 Missouri, dated October 27, 1838, had left them

8
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:09,702
 no alternative. In 1841, when this revelation was

9
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:17,005
 given, the city of Nauvoo, occupying the site of

10
00:01:17,005 --> 00:01:24,308
 the former village of Commerce, Illinois, had been

11
00:01:24,308 --> 00:01:31,611
 built up by the Saints, and here the headquarters

12
00:01:31,611 --> 00:01:38,914
 of the Church had been established. 
1–14, Joseph

13
00:01:38,914 --> 00:01:46,217
 Smith is commanded to make a solemn proclamation of

14
00:01:46,217 --> 00:01:53,52
 the gospel to the president of the United States,

15
00:01:53,52 --> 00:02:00,823
 the governors, and the rulers of all nations;

16
00:02:00,823 --> 00:02:08,126
15–21, Hyrum Smith, David W. Patten, Joseph Smith

17
00:02:08,126 --> 00:02:15,429
 Sr., and others among the living and the dead are

18
00:02:15,429 --> 00:02:22,732
 blessed for their integrity and virtues; 
22–28, The

19
00:02:22,732 --> 00:02:30,035
 Saints are commanded to build both a house for

20
00:02:30,035 --> 00:02:37,338
 the entertainment of strangers and a temple in

21
00:02:37,338 --> 00:02:44,641
 Nauvoo; 
29–36, Baptisms for the dead are to be

22
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:51,944
 performed in temples; 
37–44, The Lord’s people always

23
00:02:51,944 --> 00:02:59,247
 build temples for the performance of holy

24
00:02:59,247 --> 00:03:06,55
 ordinances; 
45–55, The Saints are excused from building the

25
00:03:06,55 --> 00:03:13,853
 temple in Jackson County because of the

26
00:03:13,853 --> 00:03:21,156
 oppression of their enemies; 
56–83, Directions are given

27
00:03:21,156 --> 00:03:28,459
 for the building of the Nauvoo House; 
84–96, Hyrum

28
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:35,762
 Smith is called to be a patriarch, to receive the

29
00:03:35,762 --> 00:03:43,065
 keys, and to stand in the place of Oliver

30
00:03:43,065 --> 00:03:50,368
 Cowdery; 
97–122, William Law and others are counseled in

31
00:03:50,368 --> 00:03:57,671
 their labors; 
123–45, General and local officers

32
00:03:57,671 --> 00:04:04,974
 are named, along with their duties and quorum

33
00:04:04,974 --> 00:04:12,277
 affiliations.

34
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:16,92
1 Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you, my servant

35
00:04:16,92 --> 00:04:21,087
 Joseph Smith, I am well pleased with your

36
00:04:21,087 --> 00:04:25,254
 offering and acknowledgments, which you have made; for

37
00:04:25,254 --> 00:04:29,421
 unto this end have I raised you up, that I might

38
00:04:29,421 --> 00:04:33,588
 show forth my wisdom through the weak things of the

39
00:04:33,588 --> 00:04:37,755
 earth

40
00:04:37,761 --> 00:04:42,332
2 Your prayers are acceptable before me; and in

41
00:04:42,332 --> 00:04:46,903
 answer to them I say unto you, that you are now

42
00:04:46,903 --> 00:04:51,474
 called immediately to make a solemn proclamation of my

43
00:04:51,474 --> 00:04:56,045
 gospel, and of this stake which I have planted to

44
00:04:56,045 --> 00:05:00,616
 be a cornerstone of Zion, which shall be polished

45
00:05:00,616 --> 00:05:05,187
 with the refinement which is after the similitude

46
00:05:05,187 --> 00:05:09,758
 of a palace

47
00:05:09,092 --> 00:05:15,692
3 This proclamation shall be made to all the kings

48
00:05:15,692 --> 00:05:22,292
 of the world, to the four corners thereof, to the

49
00:05:22,292 --> 00:05:28,892
 honorable president-elect, and the high-minded

50
00:05:28,892 --> 00:05:35,492
 governors of the nation in which you live, and to

51
00:05:35,492 --> 00:05:42,092
 all the nations of the earth scattered abroad

52
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:58,108
4 Let it be written in the spirit of meekness and

53
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:14,108
 by the power of the Holy Ghost, which shall be in

54
00:06:14,108 --> 00:06:30,108
 you at the time of the writing of the same

55
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:35,389
5 For it shall be given you by the Holy Ghost to

56
00:06:35,389 --> 00:06:40,722
 know my will concerning those kings and

57
00:06:40,722 --> 00:06:46,055
 authorities, even what shall befall them in a time to come

58
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:46,039
6 For, behold, I am about to call upon them to

59
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:46,039
 give heed to the light and glory of Zion, for the set

60
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:46,039
 time has come to favor her

61
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:49,189
7 Call ye, therefore, upon them with loud

62
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:51,989
 proclamation, and with your testimony, fearing them not,

63
00:06:51,989 --> 00:06:54,789
 for they are as grass, and all their glory as the

64
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,589
 flower thereof which soon falleth, that they may be

65
00:06:57,589 --> 00:07:00,389
 left also without excuse

66
00:07:00,42 --> 00:07:07,253
8 And that I may visit them in the day of

67
00:07:07,253 --> 00:07:14,086
 visitation, when I shall unveil the face of my covering,

68
00:07:14,086 --> 00:07:20,919
 to appoint the portion of the oppressor among

69
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:27,752
 hypocrites, where there is gnashing of teeth, if they

70
00:07:27,752 --> 00:07:34,585
 reject my servants and my testimony which I have

71
00:07:34,585 --> 00:07:41,418
 revealed unto them

72
00:07:41,411 --> 00:07:49,011
9 And again, I will visit and soften their hearts,

73
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:56,611
 many of them for your good, that ye may find

74
00:07:56,611 --> 00:08:04,211
 grace in their eyes, that they may come to the light

75
00:08:04,211 --> 00:08:11,811
 of truth, and the Gentiles to the exaltation or

76
00:08:11,811 --> 00:08:19,411
 lifting up of Zion

77
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:25,166
10 For the day of my visitation cometh speedily,

78
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:30,916
 in an hour when ye think not of; and where shall be

79
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:36,666
 the safety of my people, and refuge for those who

80
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:42,416
 shall be left of them

81
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:50,189
11 Awake, O kings of the earth! Come ye, O, come

82
00:08:50,189 --> 00:08:57,856
 ye, with your gold and your silver, to the help of

83
00:08:57,856 --> 00:09:05,523
 my people, to the house of the daughters of Zion

84
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:10,794
12 And again, verily I say unto you, let my

85
00:09:10,794 --> 00:09:16,544
 servant Robert B. Thompson help you to write this

86
00:09:16,544 --> 00:09:22,294
 proclamation, for I am well pleased with him, and that

87
00:09:22,294 --> 00:09:28,044
 he should be with you

88
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:33,034
13 Let him, therefore, hearken to your counsel,

89
00:09:33,034 --> 00:09:38,034
 and I will bless him with a multiplicity of

90
00:09:38,034 --> 00:09:43,034
 blessings; let him be faithful and true in all things from

91
00:09:43,034 --> 00:09:48,034
 henceforth, and he shall be great in mine eyes

92
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:52,821
14 But let him remember that his stewardship will

93
00:09:52,821 --> 00:09:57,321
 I require at his hands

94
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:02,647
15 And again, verily I say unto you, blessed is my

95
00:10:02,647 --> 00:10:07,447
 servant Hyrum Smith; for I, the Lord, love him

96
00:10:07,447 --> 00:10:12,247
 because of the integrity of his heart, and because

97
00:10:12,247 --> 00:10:17,047
 he loveth that which is right before me, saith the

98
00:10:17,047 --> 00:10:21,847
 Lord

99
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:27,755
16 Again, let my servant John C. Bennett help you

100
00:10:27,755 --> 00:10:33,922
 in your labor in sending my word to the kings and

101
00:10:33,922 --> 00:10:40,089
 people of the earth, and stand by you, even you my

102
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:46,256
 servant Joseph Smith, in the hour of affliction;

103
00:10:46,256 --> 00:10:52,423
 and his reward shall not fail if he receive

104
00:10:52,423 --> 00:10:58,59
 counsel

105
00:10:58,341 --> 00:11:04,541
17 And for his love he shall be great, for he

106
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:10,741
 shall be mine if he do this, saith the Lord. I have

107
00:11:10,741 --> 00:11:16,941
 seen the work which he hath done, which I accept if

108
00:11:16,941 --> 00:11:23,141
 he continue, and will crown him with blessings and

109
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:29,341
 great glory

110
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:36,422
18 And again, I say unto you that it is my will

111
00:11:36,422 --> 00:11:43,255
 that my servant Lyman Wight should continue in

112
00:11:43,255 --> 00:11:50,088
 preaching for Zion, in the spirit of meekness,

113
00:11:50,088 --> 00:11:56,921
 confessing me before the world; and I will bear him up as

114
00:11:56,921 --> 00:12:03,754
 on eagles’ wings; and he shall beget glory and

115
00:12:03,754 --> 00:12:10,587
 honor to himself and unto my name

116
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:16,81
19 That when he shall finish his work I may

117
00:12:16,81 --> 00:12:23,524
 receive him unto myself, even as I did my servant David

118
00:12:23,524 --> 00:12:30,238
 Patten, who is with me at this time, and also my

119
00:12:30,238 --> 00:12:36,952
 servant Edward Partridge, and also my aged servant

120
00:12:36,952 --> 00:12:43,666
 Joseph Smith, Sen., who sitteth with Abraham at

121
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:50,38
 his right hand, and blessed and holy is he, for he

122
00:12:50,38 --> 00:12:57,094
 is mine

123
00:12:57,577 --> 00:13:01,977
20 And again, verily I say unto you, my servant

124
00:13:01,977 --> 00:13:06,377
 George Miller is without guile; he may be trusted

125
00:13:06,377 --> 00:13:10,777
 because of the integrity of his heart; and for the

126
00:13:10,777 --> 00:13:15,177
 love which he has to my testimony I, the Lord, love

127
00:13:15,177 --> 00:13:19,577
 him

128
00:13:19,849 --> 00:13:27,278
21 I therefore say unto you, I seal upon his head

129
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:34,707
 the office of a bishopric, like unto my servant

130
00:13:34,707 --> 00:13:42,136
 Edward Partridge, that he may receive the

131
00:13:42,136 --> 00:13:49,565
 consecrations of mine house, that he may administer

132
00:13:49,565 --> 00:13:56,994
 blessings upon the heads of the poor of my people, saith

133
00:13:56,994 --> 00:14:04,423
 the Lord. Let no man despise my servant George, for

134
00:14:04,423 --> 00:14:11,852
 he shall honor me

135
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:17,917
22 Let my servant George, and my servant Lyman,

136
00:14:17,917 --> 00:14:24,517
 and my servant John Snider, and others, build a

137
00:14:24,517 --> 00:14:31,117
 house unto my name, such a one as my servant Joseph

138
00:14:31,117 --> 00:14:37,717
 shall show unto them, upon the place which he shall

139
00:14:37,717 --> 00:14:44,317
 show unto them also

140
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:52,476
23 And it shall be for a house for boarding, a

141
00:14:52,476 --> 00:15:00,619
 house that strangers may come from afar to lodge

142
00:15:00,619 --> 00:15:08,762
 therein; therefore let it be a good house, worthy of

143
00:15:08,762 --> 00:15:16,905
 all acceptation, that the weary traveler may find

144
00:15:16,905 --> 00:15:25,048
 health and safety while he shall contemplate the

145
00:15:25,048 --> 00:15:33,191
 word of the Lord; and the cornerstone I have

146
00:15:33,191 --> 00:15:41,334
 appointed for Zion

147
00:15:41,09 --> 00:15:47,09
24 This house shall be a healthful habitation if

148
00:15:47,09 --> 00:15:53,09
 it be built unto my name, and if the governor which

149
00:15:53,09 --> 00:15:59,09
 shall be appointed unto it shall not suffer any

150
00:15:59,09 --> 00:16:05,09
 pollution to come upon it. It shall be holy, or the

151
00:16:05,09 --> 00:16:11,09
 Lord your God will not dwell therein

152
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:17,637
25 And again, verily I say unto you, let all my

153
00:16:17,637 --> 00:16:24,137
 saints come from afar

154
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:31,651
26 And send ye swift messengers, yea, chosen

155
00:16:31,651 --> 00:16:38,401
 messengers, and say unto them: Come ye, with all your

156
00:16:38,401 --> 00:16:45,151
 gold, and your silver, and your precious stones,

157
00:16:45,151 --> 00:16:51,901
 and with all your antiquities; and with all who have

158
00:16:51,901 --> 00:16:58,651
 knowledge of antiquities, that will come, may

159
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:05,401
 come, and bring the box tree, and the fir tree, and

160
00:17:05,401 --> 00:17:12,151
 the pine tree, together with all the precious trees

161
00:17:12,151 --> 00:17:18,901
 of the earth

162
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:23,387
27 And with iron, with copper, and with brass, and

163
00:17:23,387 --> 00:17:28,637
 with zinc, and with all your precious things of

164
00:17:28,637 --> 00:17:33,887
 the earth; and build a house to my name, for the

165
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:39,137
 Most High to dwell therein

166
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:45,142
28 For there is not a place found on earth that he

167
00:17:45,142 --> 00:17:50,642
 may come to and restore again that which was lost

168
00:17:50,642 --> 00:17:56,142
 unto you, or which he hath taken away, even the

169
00:17:56,142 --> 00:18:01,642
 fulness of the priesthood

170
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:05,047
29 For a baptismal font there is not upon the

171
00:18:05,047 --> 00:18:08,38
 earth, that they, my saints, may be baptized for those

172
00:18:08,38 --> 00:18:11,713
 who are dead

173
00:18:11,49 --> 00:18:17,99
30 For this ordinance belongeth to my house, and

174
00:18:17,99 --> 00:18:24,49
 cannot be acceptable to me, only in the days of

175
00:18:24,49 --> 00:18:30,99
 your poverty, wherein ye are not able to build a

176
00:18:30,99 --> 00:18:37,49
 house unto me

177
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:42,483
31 But I command you, all ye my saints, to build a

178
00:18:42,483 --> 00:18:47,483
 house unto me; and I grant unto you a sufficient

179
00:18:47,483 --> 00:18:52,483
 time to build a house unto me; and during this

180
00:18:52,483 --> 00:18:57,483
 time your baptisms shall be acceptable unto me

181
00:18:57,47 --> 00:19:04,47
32 But behold, at the end of this appointment your

182
00:19:04,47 --> 00:19:11,47
 baptisms for your dead shall not be acceptable

183
00:19:11,47 --> 00:19:18,47
 unto me; and if you do not these things at the end

184
00:19:18,47 --> 00:19:25,47
 of the appointment ye shall be rejected as a

185
00:19:25,47 --> 00:19:32,47
 church, with your dead, saith the Lord your God

186
00:19:32,955 --> 00:19:38,288
33 For verily I say unto you, that after you have

187
00:19:38,288 --> 00:19:43,621
 had sufficient time to build a house to me,

188
00:19:43,621 --> 00:19:48,954
 wherein the ordinance of baptizing for the dead

189
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:54,287
 belongeth, and for which the same was instituted from

190
00:19:54,287 --> 00:19:59,62
 before the foundation of the world, your baptisms for

191
00:19:59,62 --> 00:20:04,953
 your dead cannot be acceptable unto me

192
00:20:04,687 --> 00:20:10,687
34 For therein are the keys of the holy priesthood

193
00:20:10,687 --> 00:20:16,687
 ordained, that you may receive honor and glory

194
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:21,449
35 And after this time, your baptisms for the

195
00:20:21,449 --> 00:20:26,449
 dead, by those who are scattered abroad, are not

196
00:20:26,449 --> 00:20:31,449
 acceptable unto me, saith the Lord

197
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:38,731
36 For it is ordained that in Zion, and in her

198
00:20:38,731 --> 00:20:45,731
 stakes, and in Jerusalem, those places which I have

199
00:20:45,731 --> 00:20:52,731
 appointed for refuge, shall be the places for your

200
00:20:52,731 --> 00:20:59,731
 baptisms for your dead

201
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:04,225
37 And again, verily I say unto you, how shall

202
00:21:04,225 --> 00:21:08,725
 your washings be acceptable unto me, except ye

203
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:13,225
 perform them in a house which you have built to my name

204
00:21:13,225 --> 00:21:17,725


205
00:21:17,243 --> 00:21:22,243
38 For, for this cause I commanded Moses that he

206
00:21:22,243 --> 00:21:27,243
 should build a tabernacle, that they should bear it

207
00:21:27,243 --> 00:21:32,243
 with them in the wilderness, and to build a house

208
00:21:32,243 --> 00:21:37,243
 in the land of promise, that those ordinances

209
00:21:37,243 --> 00:21:42,243
 might be revealed which had been hid from before the

210
00:21:42,243 --> 00:21:47,243
 world was

211
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:54,415
39 Therefore, verily I say unto you, that your

212
00:21:54,415 --> 00:22:01,324
 anointings, and your washings, and your baptisms for

213
00:22:01,324 --> 00:22:08,233
 the dead, and your solemn assemblies, and your

214
00:22:08,233 --> 00:22:15,142
 memorials for your sacrifices by the sons of Levi,

215
00:22:15,142 --> 00:22:22,051
 and for your oracles in your most holy places

216
00:22:22,051 --> 00:22:28,96
 wherein you receive conversations, and your statutes and

217
00:22:28,96 --> 00:22:35,869
 judgments, for the beginning of the revelations

218
00:22:35,869 --> 00:22:42,778
 and foundation of Zion, and for the glory, honor,

219
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:49,687
 and endowment of all her municipals, are ordained

220
00:22:49,687 --> 00:22:56,596
 by the ordinance of my holy house, which my people

221
00:22:56,596 --> 00:23:03,505
 are always commanded to build unto my holy name

222
00:23:03,432 --> 00:23:08,099
40 And verily I say unto you, let this house be

223
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:12,766
 built unto my name, that I may reveal mine

224
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:17,433
 ordinances therein unto my people

225
00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:22,696
41 For I deign to reveal unto my church things

226
00:23:22,696 --> 00:23:28,196
 which have been kept hid from before the foundation

227
00:23:28,196 --> 00:23:33,696
 of the world, things that pertain to the

228
00:23:33,696 --> 00:23:39,196
 dispensation of the fulness of times

229
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:44,952
42 And I will show unto my servant Joseph all

230
00:23:44,952 --> 00:23:49,952
 things pertaining to this house, and the priesthood

231
00:23:49,952 --> 00:23:54,952
 thereof, and the place whereon it shall be built

232
00:23:54,95 --> 00:24:00,283
43 And ye shall build it on the place where you

233
00:24:00,283 --> 00:24:05,616
 have contemplated building it, for that is the spot

234
00:24:05,616 --> 00:24:10,949
 which I have chosen for you to build it

235
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:15,282
44 If ye labor with all your might, I will

236
00:24:15,282 --> 00:24:20,282
 consecrate that spot that it shall be made holy

237
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:26,292
45 And if my people will hearken unto my voice,

238
00:24:26,292 --> 00:24:32,292
 and unto the voice of my servants whom I have

239
00:24:32,292 --> 00:24:38,292
 appointed to lead my people, behold, verily I say unto

240
00:24:38,292 --> 00:24:44,292
 you, they shall not be moved out of their place

241
00:24:44,266 --> 00:24:50,466
46 But if they will not hearken to my voice, nor

242
00:24:50,466 --> 00:24:56,666
 unto the voice of these men whom I have appointed,

243
00:24:56,666 --> 00:25:02,866
 they shall not be blest, because they pollute mine

244
00:25:02,866 --> 00:25:09,066
 holy grounds, and mine holy ordinances, and

245
00:25:09,066 --> 00:25:15,266
 charters, and my holy words which I give unto them

246
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:20,647
47 And it shall come to pass that if you build a

247
00:25:20,647 --> 00:25:26,047
 house unto my name, and do not do the things that I

248
00:25:26,047 --> 00:25:31,447
 say, I will not perform the oath which I make

249
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:36,847
 unto you, neither fulfil the promises which ye expect

250
00:25:36,847 --> 00:25:42,247
 at my hands, saith the Lord

251
00:25:42,524 --> 00:25:47,724
48 For instead of blessings, ye, by your own

252
00:25:47,724 --> 00:25:52,924
 works, bring cursings, wrath, indignation, and

253
00:25:52,924 --> 00:25:58,124
 judgments upon your own heads, by your follies, and by all

254
00:25:58,124 --> 00:26:03,324
 your abominations, which you practice before me,

255
00:26:03,324 --> 00:26:08,524
 saith the Lord

256
00:26:08,6 --> 00:26:12,822
49 Verily, verily, I say unto you, that when I

257
00:26:12,822 --> 00:26:17,044
 give a commandment to any of the sons of men to do a

258
00:26:17,044 --> 00:26:21,266
 work unto my name, and those sons of men go with

259
00:26:21,266 --> 00:26:25,488
 all their might and with all they have to perform

260
00:26:25,488 --> 00:26:29,71
 that work, and cease not their diligence, and their

261
00:26:29,71 --> 00:26:33,932
 enemies come upon them and hinder them from

262
00:26:33,932 --> 00:26:38,154
 performing that work, behold, it behooveth me to

263
00:26:38,154 --> 00:26:42,376
 require that work no more at the hands of those sons of

264
00:26:42,376 --> 00:26:46,598
 men, but to accept of their offerings

265
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:53,255
50 And the iniquity and transgression of my holy

266
00:26:53,255 --> 00:26:59,655
 laws and commandments I will visit upon the heads

267
00:26:59,655 --> 00:27:06,055
 of those who hindered my work, unto the third and

268
00:27:06,055 --> 00:27:12,455
 fourth generation, so long as they repent not, and

269
00:27:12,455 --> 00:27:18,855
 hate me, saith the Lord God

270
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:23,903
51 Therefore, for this cause have I accepted the

271
00:27:23,903 --> 00:27:29,703
 offerings of those whom I commanded to build up a

272
00:27:29,703 --> 00:27:35,503
 city and a house unto my name, in Jackson county,

273
00:27:35,503 --> 00:27:41,303
 Missouri, and were hindered by their enemies, saith

274
00:27:41,303 --> 00:27:47,103
 the Lord your God

275
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:52,899
52 And I will answer judgment, wrath, and

276
00:27:52,899 --> 00:27:58,699
 indignation, wailing, and anguish, and gnashing of teeth

277
00:27:58,699 --> 00:28:04,499
 upon their heads, unto the third and fourth

278
00:28:04,499 --> 00:28:10,299
 generation, so long as they repent not, and hate me,

279
00:28:10,299 --> 00:28:16,099
 saith the Lord your God

280
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:21,795
53 And this I make an example unto you, for your

281
00:28:21,795 --> 00:28:26,995
 consolation concerning all those who have been

282
00:28:26,995 --> 00:28:32,195
 commanded to do a work and have been hindered by the

283
00:28:32,195 --> 00:28:37,395
 hands of their enemies, and by oppression, saith

284
00:28:37,395 --> 00:28:42,595
 the Lord your God

285
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:46,887
54 For I am the Lord your God, and will save all

286
00:28:46,887 --> 00:28:51,387
 those of your brethren who have been pure in heart,

287
00:28:51,387 --> 00:28:55,887
 and have been slain in the land of Missouri,

288
00:28:55,887 --> 00:29:00,387
 saith the Lord

289
00:29:00,389 --> 00:29:06,222
55 And again, verily I say unto you, I command you

290
00:29:06,222 --> 00:29:12,055
 again to build a house to my name, even in this

291
00:29:12,055 --> 00:29:17,888
 place, that you may prove yourselves unto me that

292
00:29:17,888 --> 00:29:23,721
 ye are faithful in all things whatsoever I command

293
00:29:23,721 --> 00:29:29,554
 you, that I may bless you, and crown you with

294
00:29:29,554 --> 00:29:35,387
 honor, immortality, and eternal life

295
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:41,541
56 And now I say unto you, as pertaining to my

296
00:29:41,541 --> 00:29:47,208
 boarding house which I have commanded you to build

297
00:29:47,208 --> 00:29:52,875
 for the boarding of strangers, let it be built unto

298
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:58,542
 my name, and let my name be named upon it, and let

299
00:29:58,542 --> 00:30:04,209
 my servant Joseph and his house have place

300
00:30:04,209 --> 00:30:09,876
 therein, from generation to generation

301
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:14,374
57 For this anointing have I put upon his head,

302
00:30:14,374 --> 00:30:19,374
 that his blessing shall also be put upon the head of

303
00:30:19,374 --> 00:30:24,374
 his posterity after him

304
00:30:24,89 --> 00:30:30,39
58 And as I said unto Abraham concerning the

305
00:30:30,39 --> 00:30:35,89
 kindreds of the earth, even so I say unto my servant

306
00:30:35,89 --> 00:30:41,39
 Joseph: In thee and in thy seed shall the kindred of

307
00:30:41,39 --> 00:30:46,89
 the earth be blessed

308
00:30:46,645 --> 00:30:52,312
59 Therefore, let my servant Joseph and his seed

309
00:30:52,312 --> 00:30:57,979
 after him have place in that house, from generation

310
00:30:57,979 --> 00:31:03,646
 to generation, forever and ever, saith the Lord

311
00:31:03,178 --> 00:31:10,978
60 And let the name of that house be called Nauvoo

312
00:31:10,978 --> 00:31:18,778
 House; and let it be a delightful habitation for

313
00:31:18,778 --> 00:31:26,578
 man, and a resting-place for the weary traveler,

314
00:31:26,578 --> 00:31:34,378
 that he may contemplate the glory of Zion, and the

315
00:31:34,378 --> 00:31:42,178
 glory of this, the cornerstone thereof

316
00:31:42,15 --> 00:31:48,817
61 That he may receive also the counsel from those

317
00:31:48,817 --> 00:31:55,484
 whom I have set to be as plants of renown, and as

318
00:31:55,484 --> 00:32:02,151
 watchmen upon her walls

319
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:08,338
62 Behold, verily I say unto you, let my servant

320
00:32:08,338 --> 00:32:14,005
 George Miller, and my servant Lyman Wight, and my

321
00:32:14,005 --> 00:32:19,672
 servant John Snider, and my servant Peter Haws,

322
00:32:19,672 --> 00:32:25,339
 organize themselves, and appoint one of them to be a

323
00:32:25,339 --> 00:32:31,006
 president over their quorum for the purpose of

324
00:32:31,006 --> 00:32:36,673
 building that house

325
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:42,988
63 And they shall form a constitution, whereby

326
00:32:42,988 --> 00:32:49,321
 they may receive stock for the building of that

327
00:32:49,321 --> 00:32:55,654
 house

328
00:32:55,423 --> 00:33:00,923
64 And they shall not receive less than fifty

329
00:33:00,923 --> 00:33:06,423
 dollars for a share of stock in that house, and they

330
00:33:06,423 --> 00:33:11,923
 shall be permitted to receive fifteen thousand

331
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:17,423
 dollars from any one man for stock in that house

332
00:33:17,445 --> 00:33:23,445
65 But they shall not be permitted to receive over

333
00:33:23,445 --> 00:33:29,445
 fifteen thousand dollars stock from any one man

334
00:33:29,975 --> 00:33:35,308
66 And they shall not be permitted to receive

335
00:33:35,308 --> 00:33:40,641
 under fifty dollars for a share of stock from any one

336
00:33:40,641 --> 00:33:45,974
 man in that house

337
00:33:45,79 --> 00:33:49,79
67 And they shall not be permitted to receive any

338
00:33:49,79 --> 00:33:53,79
 man, as a stockholder in this house, except the

339
00:33:53,79 --> 00:33:57,79
 same shall pay his stock into their hands at the

340
00:33:57,79 --> 00:34:01,79
 time he receives stock

341
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:08,023
68 And in proportion to the amount of stock he

342
00:34:08,023 --> 00:34:14,273
 pays into their hands he shall receive stock in that

343
00:34:14,273 --> 00:34:20,523
 house; but if he pays nothing into their hands he

344
00:34:20,523 --> 00:34:26,773
 shall not receive any stock in that house

345
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:31,512
69 And if any pay stock into their hands it shall

346
00:34:31,512 --> 00:34:36,226
 be for stock in that house, for himself, and for

347
00:34:36,226 --> 00:34:40,94
 his generation after him, from generation to

348
00:34:40,94 --> 00:34:45,654
 generation, so long as he and his heirs shall hold that

349
00:34:45,654 --> 00:34:50,368
 stock, and do not sell or convey the stock away

350
00:34:50,368 --> 00:34:55,082
 out of their hands by their own free will and act,

351
00:34:55,082 --> 00:34:59,796
 if you will do my will, saith the Lord your God

352
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:05,597
70 And again, verily I say unto you, if my servant

353
00:35:05,597 --> 00:35:12,097
 George Miller, and my servant Lyman Wight, and my

354
00:35:12,097 --> 00:35:18,597
 servant John Snider, and my servant Peter Haws,

355
00:35:18,597 --> 00:35:25,097
 receive any stock into their hands, in moneys, or

356
00:35:25,097 --> 00:35:31,597
 in properties wherein they receive the real value

357
00:35:31,597 --> 00:35:38,097
 of moneys, they shall not appropriate any portion

358
00:35:38,097 --> 00:35:44,597
 of that stock to any other purpose, only in that

359
00:35:44,597 --> 00:35:51,097
 house

360
00:35:51,049 --> 00:35:57,299
71 And if they do appropriate any portion of that

361
00:35:57,299 --> 00:36:03,549
 stock anywhere else, only in that house, without

362
00:36:03,549 --> 00:36:09,799
 the consent of the stockholder, and do not repay

363
00:36:09,799 --> 00:36:16,049
 four-fold for the stock which they appropriate

364
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:22,299
 anywhere else, only in that house, they shall be

365
00:36:22,299 --> 00:36:28,549
 accursed, and shall be moved out of their place, saith

366
00:36:28,549 --> 00:36:34,799
 the Lord God; for I, the Lord, am God, and cannot

367
00:36:34,799 --> 00:36:41,049
 be mocked in any of these things

368
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:49,2
72 Verily I say unto you, let my servant Joseph

369
00:36:49,2 --> 00:36:56,867
 pay stock into their hands for the building of that

370
00:36:56,867 --> 00:37:04,534
 house, as seemeth him good; but my servant Joseph

371
00:37:04,534 --> 00:37:12,201
 cannot pay over fifteen thousand dollars stock in

372
00:37:12,201 --> 00:37:19,868
 that house, nor under fifty dollars; neither can

373
00:37:19,868 --> 00:37:27,535
 any other man, saith the Lord

374
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:31,162
73 And there are others also who wish to know my

375
00:37:31,162 --> 00:37:34,829
 will concerning them, for they have asked it at my

376
00:37:34,829 --> 00:37:38,496
 hands

377
00:37:38,273 --> 00:37:44,023
74 Therefore, I say unto you concerning my servant

378
00:37:44,023 --> 00:37:49,773
 Vinson Knight, if he will do my will let him put

379
00:37:49,773 --> 00:37:55,523
 stock into that house for himself, and for his

380
00:37:55,523 --> 00:38:01,273
 generation after him, from generation to generation

381
00:38:01,763 --> 00:38:07,334
75 And let him lift up his voice long and loud, in

382
00:38:07,334 --> 00:38:12,905
 the midst of the people, to plead the cause of

383
00:38:12,905 --> 00:38:18,476
 the poor and the needy; and let him not fail,

384
00:38:18,476 --> 00:38:24,047
 neither let his heart faint; and I will accept of his

385
00:38:24,047 --> 00:38:29,618
 offerings, for they shall not be unto me as the

386
00:38:29,618 --> 00:38:35,189
 offerings of Cain, for he shall be mine, saith the

387
00:38:35,189 --> 00:38:40,76
 Lord

388
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:46,535
76 Let his family rejoice and turn away their

389
00:38:46,535 --> 00:38:52,335
 hearts from affliction; for I have chosen him and

390
00:38:52,335 --> 00:38:58,135
 anointed him, and he shall be honored in the midst of

391
00:38:58,135 --> 00:39:03,935
 his house, for I will forgive all his sins, saith

392
00:39:03,935 --> 00:39:09,735
 the Lord. Amen

393
00:39:09,731 --> 00:39:15,231
77 Verily I say unto you, let my servant Hyrum put

394
00:39:15,231 --> 00:39:20,731
 stock into that house as seemeth him good, for

395
00:39:20,731 --> 00:39:26,231
 himself and his generation after him, from

396
00:39:26,231 --> 00:39:31,731
 generation to generation

397
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:38,886
78 Let my servant Isaac Galland put stock into

398
00:39:38,886 --> 00:39:46,486
 that house; for I, the Lord, love him for the work he

399
00:39:46,486 --> 00:39:54,086
 hath done, and will forgive all his sins;

400
00:39:54,086 --> 00:40:01,686
 therefore, let him be remembered for an interest in that

401
00:40:01,686 --> 00:40:09,286
 house from generation to generation

402
00:40:09,023 --> 00:40:14,19
79 Let my servant Isaac Galland be appointed among

403
00:40:14,19 --> 00:40:19,357
 you, and be ordained by my servant William Marks,

404
00:40:19,357 --> 00:40:24,524
 and be blessed of him, to go with my servant

405
00:40:24,524 --> 00:40:29,691
 Hyrum to accomplish the work that my servant Joseph

406
00:40:29,691 --> 00:40:34,858
 shall point out to them, and they shall be greatly

407
00:40:34,858 --> 00:40:40,025
 blessed

408
00:40:40,989 --> 00:40:48,656
80 Let my servant William Marks pay stock into

409
00:40:48,656 --> 00:40:56,323
 that house, as seemeth him good, for himself and his

410
00:40:56,323 --> 00:41:03,99
 generation, from generation to generation

411
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:09,244
81 Let my servant Henry G. Sherwood pay stock into

412
00:41:09,244 --> 00:41:14,994
 that house, as seemeth him good, for himself and

413
00:41:14,994 --> 00:41:20,744
 his seed after him, from generation to generation

414
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:26,494


415
00:41:26,25 --> 00:41:31,583
82 Let my servant William Law pay stock into that

416
00:41:31,583 --> 00:41:36,916
 house, for himself and his seed after him, from

417
00:41:36,916 --> 00:41:42,249
 generation to generation

418
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:48,583
83 If he will do my will let him not take his

419
00:41:48,583 --> 00:41:54,583
 family unto the eastern lands, even unto Kirtland;

420
00:41:54,583 --> 00:42:00,583
 nevertheless, I, the Lord, will build up Kirtland,

421
00:42:00,583 --> 00:42:06,583
 but I, the Lord, have a scourge prepared for the

422
00:42:06,583 --> 00:42:12,583
 inhabitants thereof

423
00:42:12,63 --> 00:42:19,797
84 And with my servant Almon Babbitt, there are

424
00:42:19,797 --> 00:42:26,964
 many things with which I am not pleased; behold, he

425
00:42:26,964 --> 00:42:34,131
 aspireth to establish his counsel instead of the

426
00:42:34,131 --> 00:42:41,298
 counsel which I have ordained, even that of the

427
00:42:41,298 --> 00:42:48,465
 Presidency of my Church; and he setteth up a golden

428
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:55,632
 calf for the worship of my people

429
00:42:55,156 --> 00:43:01,156
85 Let no man go from this place who has come here

430
00:43:01,156 --> 00:43:07,156
 essaying to keep my commandments

431
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:12,185
86 If they live here let them live unto me; and if

432
00:43:12,185 --> 00:43:16,685
 they die let them die unto me; for they shall

433
00:43:16,685 --> 00:43:21,185
 rest from all their labors here, and shall continue

434
00:43:21,185 --> 00:43:25,685
 their works

435
00:43:25,97 --> 00:43:32,37
87 Therefore, let my servant William put his trust

436
00:43:32,37 --> 00:43:38,77
 in me, and cease to fear concerning his family,

437
00:43:38,77 --> 00:43:45,17
 because of the sickness of the land. If ye love me,

438
00:43:45,17 --> 00:43:51,57
 keep my commandments; and the sickness of the

439
00:43:51,57 --> 00:43:57,97
 land shall redound to your glory

440
00:43:57,702 --> 00:44:02,591
88 Let my servant William go and proclaim my

441
00:44:02,591 --> 00:44:07,48
 everlasting gospel with a loud voice, and with great

442
00:44:07,48 --> 00:44:12,369
 joy, as he shall be moved upon by my Spirit, unto

443
00:44:12,369 --> 00:44:17,258
 the inhabitants of Warsaw, and also unto the

444
00:44:17,258 --> 00:44:22,147
 inhabitants of Carthage, and also unto the inhabitants of

445
00:44:22,147 --> 00:44:27,036
 Burlington, and also unto the inhabitants of

446
00:44:27,036 --> 00:44:31,925
 Madison, and await patiently and diligently for

447
00:44:31,925 --> 00:44:36,814
 further instructions at my general conference, saith the

448
00:44:36,814 --> 00:44:41,703
 Lord

449
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:46,579
89 If he will do my will let him from henceforth

450
00:44:46,579 --> 00:44:51,979
 hearken to the counsel of my servant Joseph, and

451
00:44:51,979 --> 00:44:57,378
 with his interest support the cause of the poor, and

452
00:44:57,378 --> 00:45:02,778
 publish the new translation of my holy word unto

453
00:45:02,778 --> 00:45:08,178
 the inhabitants of the earth

454
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:15,106
90 And if he will do this I will bless him with a

455
00:45:15,106 --> 00:45:21,773
 multiplicity of blessings, that he shall not be

456
00:45:21,773 --> 00:45:28,44
 forsaken, nor his seed be found begging bread

457
00:45:28,426 --> 00:45:34,283
91 And again, verily I say unto you, let my

458
00:45:34,283 --> 00:45:40,14
 servant William be appointed, ordained, and anointed, as

459
00:45:40,14 --> 00:45:45,997
 counselor unto my servant Joseph, in the room of

460
00:45:45,997 --> 00:45:51,854
 my servant Hyrum, that my servant Hyrum may take

461
00:45:51,854 --> 00:45:57,711
 the office of Priesthood and Patriarch, which was

462
00:45:57,711 --> 00:46:03,568
 appointed unto him by his father, by blessing and

463
00:46:03,568 --> 00:46:09,425
 also by right

464
00:46:09,684 --> 00:46:14,684
92 That from henceforth he shall hold the keys of

465
00:46:14,684 --> 00:46:19,684
 the patriarchal blessings upon the heads of all my

466
00:46:19,684 --> 00:46:24,684
 people

467
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:30,549
93 That whoever he blesses shall be blessed, and

468
00:46:30,549 --> 00:46:36,149
 whoever he curses shall be cursed; that whatsoever

469
00:46:36,149 --> 00:46:41,749
 he shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven;

470
00:46:41,749 --> 00:46:47,349
 and whatsoever he shall loose on earth shall be

471
00:46:47,349 --> 00:46:52,949
 loosed in heaven

472
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:57,209
94 And from this time forth I appoint unto him

473
00:46:57,209 --> 00:47:02,209
 that he may be a prophet, and a seer, and a revelator

474
00:47:02,209 --> 00:47:07,209
 unto my church, as well as my servant Joseph

475
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:14,958
95 That he may act in concert also with my servant

476
00:47:14,958 --> 00:47:21,958
 Joseph; and that he shall receive counsel from my

477
00:47:21,958 --> 00:47:28,958
 servant Joseph, who shall show unto him the keys

478
00:47:28,958 --> 00:47:35,958
 whereby he may ask and receive, and be crowned

479
00:47:35,958 --> 00:47:42,958
 with the same blessing, and glory, and honor, and

480
00:47:42,958 --> 00:47:49,958
 priesthood, and gifts of the priesthood, that once

481
00:47:49,958 --> 00:47:56,958
 were put upon him that was my servant Oliver

482
00:47:56,958 --> 00:48:03,958
 Cowdery

483
00:48:03,898 --> 00:48:08,898
96 That my servant Hyrum may bear record of the

484
00:48:08,898 --> 00:48:13,898
 things which I shall show unto him, that his name

485
00:48:13,898 --> 00:48:18,898
 may be had in honorable remembrance from generation

486
00:48:18,898 --> 00:48:23,898
 to generation, forever and ever

487
00:48:23,884 --> 00:48:29,884
97 Let my servant William Law also receive the

488
00:48:29,884 --> 00:48:35,884
 keys by which he may ask and receive blessings; let

489
00:48:35,884 --> 00:48:41,884
 him be humble before me, and be without guile, and

490
00:48:41,884 --> 00:48:47,884
 he shall receive of my Spirit, even the Comforter,

491
00:48:47,884 --> 00:48:53,884
 which shall manifest unto him the truth of all

492
00:48:53,884 --> 00:48:59,884
 things, and shall give him, in the very hour, what

493
00:48:59,884 --> 00:49:05,884
 he shall say

494
00:49:05,86 --> 00:49:12,11
98 And these signs shall follow him—he shall heal

495
00:49:12,11 --> 00:49:18,36
 the sick, he shall cast out devils, and shall be

496
00:49:18,36 --> 00:49:24,61
 delivered from those who would administer unto him

497
00:49:24,61 --> 00:49:30,86
 deadly poison

498
00:49:30,151 --> 00:49:35,401
99 And he shall be led in paths where the

499
00:49:35,401 --> 00:49:40,651
 poisonous serpent cannot lay hold upon his heel, and he

500
00:49:40,651 --> 00:49:45,901
 shall mount up in the imagination of his thoughts as

501
00:49:45,901 --> 00:49:51,151
 upon eagles’ wings

502
00:49:51,655 --> 00:50:00,155
100 And what if I will that he should raise the

503
00:50:00,155 --> 00:50:08,655
 dead, let him not withhold his voice

504
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:14,422
101 Therefore, let my servant William cry aloud

505
00:50:14,422 --> 00:50:20,172
 and spare not, with joy and rejoicing, and with

506
00:50:20,172 --> 00:50:25,922
 hosannas to him that sitteth upon the throne forever

507
00:50:25,922 --> 00:50:31,672
 and ever, saith the Lord your God

508
00:50:31,662 --> 00:50:38,662
102 Behold, I say unto you, I have a mission in

509
00:50:38,662 --> 00:50:45,662
 store for my servant William, and my servant Hyrum,

510
00:50:45,662 --> 00:50:52,662
 and for them alone; and let my servant Joseph

511
00:50:52,662 --> 00:50:59,662
 tarry at home, for he is needed. The remainder I will

512
00:50:59,662 --> 00:51:06,662
 show unto you hereafter. Even so. Amen

513
00:51:06,413 --> 00:51:11,613
103 And again, verily I say unto you, if my

514
00:51:11,613 --> 00:51:16,813
 servant Sidney will serve me and be counselor unto my

515
00:51:16,813 --> 00:51:22,013
 servant Joseph, let him arise and come up and stand

516
00:51:22,013 --> 00:51:27,213
 in the office of his calling, and humble himself

517
00:51:27,213 --> 00:51:32,413
 before me

518
00:51:32,69 --> 00:51:38,523
104 And if he will offer unto me an acceptable

519
00:51:38,523 --> 00:51:44,356
 offering, and acknowledgments, and remain with my

520
00:51:44,356 --> 00:51:50,189
 people, behold, I, the Lord your God, will heal him

521
00:51:50,189 --> 00:51:56,022
 that he shall be healed; and he shall lift up his

522
00:51:56,022 --> 00:52:01,855
 voice again on the mountains, and be a spokesman

523
00:52:01,855 --> 00:52:07,688
 before my face

524
00:52:07,441 --> 00:52:14,441
105 Let him come and locate his family in the

525
00:52:14,441 --> 00:52:21,441
 neighborhood in which my servant Joseph resides

526
00:52:21,205 --> 00:52:29,205
106 And in all his journeyings let him lift up his

527
00:52:29,205 --> 00:52:37,205
 voice as with the sound of a trump, and warn the

528
00:52:37,205 --> 00:52:45,205
 inhabitants of the earth to flee the wrath to

529
00:52:45,205 --> 00:52:53,205
 come

530
00:52:53,17 --> 00:52:59,92
107 Let him assist my servant Joseph, and also let

531
00:52:59,92 --> 00:53:06,67
 my servant William Law assist my servant Joseph,

532
00:53:06,67 --> 00:53:13,42
 in making a solemn proclamation unto the kings of

533
00:53:13,42 --> 00:53:20,17
 the earth, even as I have before said unto you

534
00:53:20,914 --> 00:53:26,664
108 If my servant Sidney will do my will, let him

535
00:53:26,664 --> 00:53:32,414
 not remove his family unto the eastern lands, but

536
00:53:32,414 --> 00:53:38,164
 let him change their habitation, even as I have

537
00:53:38,164 --> 00:53:43,914
 said

538
00:53:43,42 --> 00:53:50,087
109 Behold, it is not my will that he shall seek

539
00:53:50,087 --> 00:53:56,754
 to find safety and refuge out of the city which I

540
00:53:56,754 --> 00:54:03,421
 have appointed unto you, even the city of Nauvoo

541
00:54:03,207 --> 00:54:07,874
110 Verily I say unto you, even now, if he will

542
00:54:07,874 --> 00:54:12,541
 hearken unto my voice, it shall be well with him.

543
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:17,208
 Even so. Amen

544
00:54:17,204 --> 00:54:24,954
111 And again, verily I say unto you, let my

545
00:54:24,954 --> 00:54:32,704
 servant Amos Davies pay stock into the hands of those

546
00:54:32,704 --> 00:54:40,454
 whom I have appointed to build a house for

547
00:54:40,454 --> 00:54:48,204
 boarding, even the Nauvoo House

548
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:55,185
112 This let him do if he will have an interest;

549
00:54:55,185 --> 00:55:01,685
 and let him hearken unto the counsel of my servant

550
00:55:01,685 --> 00:55:08,185
 Joseph, and labor with his own hands that he may

551
00:55:08,185 --> 00:55:14,685
 obtain the confidence of men

552
00:55:14,444 --> 00:55:19,194
113 And when he shall prove himself faithful in

553
00:55:19,194 --> 00:55:23,944
 all things that shall be entrusted unto his care,

554
00:55:23,944 --> 00:55:28,694
 yea, even a few things, he shall be made ruler over

555
00:55:28,694 --> 00:55:33,444
 many

556
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:38,497
114 Let him therefore abase himself that he may be

557
00:55:38,497 --> 00:55:43,497
 exalted. Even so. Amen

558
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:50,107
115 And again, verily I say unto you, if my

559
00:55:50,107 --> 00:55:56,707
 servant Robert D. Foster will obey my voice, let him

560
00:55:56,707 --> 00:56:03,307
 build a house for my servant Joseph, according to the

561
00:56:03,307 --> 00:56:09,907
 contract which he has made with him, as the door

562
00:56:09,907 --> 00:56:16,507
 shall be open to him from time to time

563
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:21,039
116 And let him repent of all his folly, and

564
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:26,039
 clothe himself with charity; and cease to do evil, and

565
00:56:26,039 --> 00:56:31,039
 lay aside all his hard speeches

566
00:56:31,538 --> 00:56:36,871
117 And pay stock also into the hands of the

567
00:56:36,871 --> 00:56:42,204
 quorum of the Nauvoo House, for himself and for his

568
00:56:42,204 --> 00:56:47,537
 generation after him, from generation to generation

569
00:56:47,854 --> 00:56:55,454
118 And hearken unto the counsel of my servants

570
00:56:55,454 --> 00:57:03,054
 Joseph, and Hyrum, and William Law, and unto the

571
00:57:03,054 --> 00:57:10,654
 authorities which I have called to lay the foundation

572
00:57:10,654 --> 00:57:18,254
 of Zion; and it shall be well with him forever

573
00:57:18,254 --> 00:57:25,854
 and ever. Even so. Amen

574
00:57:25,592 --> 00:57:33,792
119 And again, verily I say unto you, let no man

575
00:57:33,792 --> 00:57:41,992
 pay stock to the quorum of the Nauvoo House unless

576
00:57:41,992 --> 00:57:50,192
 he shall be a believer in the Book of Mormon, and

577
00:57:50,192 --> 00:57:58,392
 the revelations I have given unto you, saith the

578
00:57:58,392 --> 00:58:06,592
 Lord your God

579
00:58:06,35 --> 00:58:11,1
120 For that which is more or less than this

580
00:58:11,1 --> 00:58:15,85
 cometh of evil, and shall be attended with cursings and

581
00:58:15,85 --> 00:58:20,6
 not blessings, saith the Lord your God. Even so.

582
00:58:20,6 --> 00:58:25,35
 Amen

583
00:58:25,852 --> 00:58:30,352
121 And again, verily I say unto you, let the

584
00:58:30,352 --> 00:58:34,852
 quorum of the Nauvoo House have a just recompense of

585
00:58:34,852 --> 00:58:39,352
 wages for all their labors which they do in

586
00:58:39,352 --> 00:58:43,852
 building the Nauvoo House; and let their wages be as

587
00:58:43,852 --> 00:58:48,352
 shall be agreed among themselves, as pertaining to the

588
00:58:48,352 --> 00:58:52,852
 price thereof

589
00:58:52,612 --> 00:59:00,812
122 And let every man who pays stock bear his

590
00:59:00,812 --> 00:59:09,012
 proportion of their wages, if it must needs be, for

591
00:59:09,012 --> 00:59:17,212
 their support, saith the Lord; otherwise, their

592
00:59:17,212 --> 00:59:25,412
 labors shall be accounted unto them for stock in that

593
00:59:25,412 --> 00:59:33,612
 house. Even so. Amen

594
00:59:33,603 --> 00:59:37,803
123 Verily I say unto you, I now give unto you the

595
00:59:37,803 --> 00:59:42,003
 officers belonging to my Priesthood, that ye may

596
00:59:42,003 --> 00:59:46,203
 hold the keys thereof, even the Priesthood which

597
00:59:46,203 --> 00:59:50,403
 is after the order of Melchizedek, which is after

598
00:59:50,403 --> 00:59:54,603
 the order of mine Only Begotten Son

599
00:59:54,875 --> 01:00:02,042
124 First, I give unto you Hyrum Smith to be a

600
01:00:02,042 --> 01:00:09,209
 patriarch unto you, to hold the sealing blessings of

601
01:00:09,209 --> 01:00:16,376
 my church, even the Holy Spirit of promise,

602
01:00:16,376 --> 01:00:23,543
 whereby ye are sealed up unto the day of redemption,

603
01:00:23,543 --> 01:00:30,71
 that ye may not fall notwithstanding the hour of

604
01:00:30,71 --> 01:00:37,877
 temptation that may come upon you

605
01:00:37,15 --> 01:00:43,817
125 I give unto you my servant Joseph to be a

606
01:00:43,817 --> 01:00:50,484
 presiding elder over all my church, to be a

607
01:00:50,484 --> 01:00:57,151
 translator, a revelator, a seer, and prophet

608
01:00:57,137 --> 01:01:04,137
126 I give unto him for counselors my servant

609
01:01:04,137 --> 01:01:11,137
 Sidney Rigdon and my servant William Law, that these

610
01:01:11,137 --> 01:01:18,137
 may constitute a quorum and First Presidency, to

611
01:01:18,137 --> 01:01:25,137
 receive the oracles for the whole church

612
01:01:25,649 --> 01:01:33,649
127 I give unto you my servant Brigham Young to be

613
01:01:33,649 --> 01:01:41,649
 a president over the Twelve traveling council

614
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:46,381
128 Which Twelve hold the keys to open up the

615
01:01:46,381 --> 01:01:51,131
 authority of my kingdom upon the four corners of the

616
01:01:51,131 --> 01:01:55,881
 earth, and after that to send my word to every

617
01:01:55,881 --> 01:02:00,631
 creature

618
01:02:00,15 --> 01:02:11,15
129 They are Heber C. Kimball, Parley P. Pratt,

619
01:02:11,15 --> 01:02:22,15
 Orson Pratt, Orson Hyde, William Smith, John Taylor,

620
01:02:22,15 --> 01:02:33,15
 John E. Page, Wilford Woodruff, Willard Richards,

621
01:02:33,15 --> 01:02:44,15
 George A. Smith

622
01:02:44,411 --> 01:02:50,911
130 David Patten I have taken unto myself; behold,

623
01:02:50,911 --> 01:02:57,411
 his priesthood no man taketh from him; but,

624
01:02:57,411 --> 01:03:03,911
 verily I say unto you, another may be appointed unto

625
01:03:03,911 --> 01:03:10,411
 the same calling

626
01:03:10,737 --> 01:03:18,237
131 And again, I say unto you, I give unto you a

627
01:03:18,237 --> 01:03:25,737
 high council, for the cornerstone of Zion

628
01:03:25,018 --> 01:03:34,462
132 Namely, Samuel Bent, Henry G. Sherwood,

629
01:03:34,462 --> 01:03:43,906

01:03:53,35 --> 01:04:02,794
 I have taken unto myself; no man taketh his

632
01:04:02,794 --> 01:04:12,238
 priesthood, but another may be appointed unto the same

633
01:04:12,238 --> 01:04:21,682
 priesthood in his stead; and verily I say unto you,

634
01:04:21,682 --> 01:04:31,126
 let my servant Aaron Johnson be ordained unto

635
01:04:31,126 --> 01:04:40,57
 this calling in his stead—David Fullmer, Alpheus

636
01:04:40,57 --> 01:04:50,014
 Cutler, William Huntington

637
01:04:50,236 --> 01:04:55,736
133 And again, I give unto you Don C. Smith to be

638
01:04:55,736 --> 01:05:01,236
 a president over a quorum of high priests

639
01:05:01,514 --> 01:05:05,264
134 Which ordinance is instituted for the purpose

640
01:05:05,264 --> 01:05:09,014
 of qualifying those who shall be appointed

641
01:05:09,014 --> 01:05:12,764
 standing presidents or servants over different stakes

642
01:05:12,764 --> 01:05:16,514
 scattered abroad

643
01:05:16,029 --> 01:05:20,529
135 And they may travel also if they choose, but

644
01:05:20,529 --> 01:05:25,029
 rather be ordained for standing presidents; this is

645
01:05:25,029 --> 01:05:29,529
 the office of their calling, saith the Lord your

646
01:05:29,529 --> 01:05:34,029
 God

647
01:05:34,314 --> 01:05:41,981
136 I give unto him Amasa Lyman and Noah Packard

648
01:05:41,981 --> 01:05:49,648
 for counselors, that they may preside over the

649
01:05:49,648 --> 01:05:57,315
 quorum of high priests of my church, saith the Lord

650
01:05:57,07 --> 01:06:03,784
137 And again, I say unto you, I give unto you

651
01:06:03,784 --> 01:06:10,498
 John A. Hicks, Samuel Williams, and Jesse Baker,

652
01:06:10,498 --> 01:06:17,212
 which priesthood is to preside over the quorum of

653
01:06:17,212 --> 01:06:23,926
 elders, which quorum is instituted for standing

654
01:06:23,926 --> 01:06:30,64
 ministers; nevertheless they may travel, yet they are

655
01:06:30,64 --> 01:06:37,354
 ordained to be standing ministers to my church,

656
01:06:37,354 --> 01:06:44,068
 saith the Lord

657
01:06:44,534 --> 01:06:54,284
138 And again, I give unto you Joseph Young,

658
01:06:54,284 --> 01:07:04,034
 Josiah Butterfield, Daniel Miles, Henry Herriman, Zera

659
01:07:04,034 --> 01:07:13,784
 Pulsipher, Levi Hancock, James Foster, to preside

660
01:07:13,784 --> 01:07:23,534
 over the quorum of seventies

661
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:31,289
139 Which quorum is instituted for traveling

662
01:07:31,289 --> 01:07:39,539
 elders to bear record of my name in all the world,

663
01:07:39,539 --> 01:07:47,789
 wherever the traveling high council, mine apostles,

664
01:07:47,789 --> 01:07:56,039
 shall send them to prepare a way before my face

665
01:07:56,039 --> 01:08:01,468
140 The difference between this quorum and the

666
01:08:01,468 --> 01:08:06,897
 quorum of elders is that one is to travel

667
01:08:06,897 --> 01:08:12,326
 continually, and the other is to preside over the churches

668
01:08:12,326 --> 01:08:17,755
 from time to time; the one has the responsibility of

669
01:08:17,755 --> 01:08:23,184
 presiding from time to time, and the other has no

670
01:08:23,184 --> 01:08:28,613
 responsibility of presiding, saith the Lord your

671
01:08:28,613 --> 01:08:34,042
 God

672
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:41,927
141 And again, I say unto you, I give unto you

673
01:08:41,927 --> 01:08:49,327
 Vinson Knight, Samuel H. Smith, and Shadrach Roundy,

674
01:08:49,327 --> 01:08:56,727
 if he will receive it, to preside over the

675
01:08:56,727 --> 01:09:04,127
 bishopric; a knowledge of said bishopric is given unto

676
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:11,527
 you in the book of Doctrine and Covenants

677
01:09:11,781 --> 01:09:16,981
142 And again, I say unto you, Samuel Rolfe and

678
01:09:16,981 --> 01:09:22,181
 his counselors for priests, and the president of the

679
01:09:22,181 --> 01:09:27,381
 teachers and his counselors, and also the

680
01:09:27,381 --> 01:09:32,581
 president of the deacons and his counselors, and also the

681
01:09:32,581 --> 01:09:37,781
 president of the stake and his counselors

682
01:09:37,056 --> 01:09:41,806
143 The above offices I have given unto you, and

683
01:09:41,806 --> 01:09:46,556
 the keys thereof, for helps and for governments,

684
01:09:46,556 --> 01:09:51,306
 for the work of the ministry and the perfecting of

685
01:09:51,306 --> 01:09:56,056
 my saints

686
01:09:56,809 --> 01:10:02,809
144 And a commandment I give unto you, that you

687
01:10:02,809 --> 01:10:08,809
 should fill all these offices and approve of those

688
01:10:08,809 --> 01:10:14,809
 names which I have mentioned, or else disapprove of

689
01:10:14,809 --> 01:10:20,809
 them at my general conference

690
01:10:20,066 --> 01:10:26,399
145 And that ye should prepare rooms for all these

691
01:10:26,399 --> 01:10:32,732
 offices in my house when you build it unto my

692
01:10:32,732 --> 01:10:39,065
 name, saith the Lord your God. Even so. Amen.
