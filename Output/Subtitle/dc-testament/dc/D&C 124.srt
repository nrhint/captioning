00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 124 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Prophet, at Nauvoo, Illinois, January 19, 1841.

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Because of increasing persecutions and illegal

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
procedures against them by public officers, the

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Saints had been compelled to leave Missouri. The

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
exterminating order issued by Lilburn W. Boggs,

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
governor of Missouri, dated October 27, 1838,

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
had left them no alternative. In 1841, when this

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
revelation was given, the city of Nauvoo,

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
occupying the site of the former village of Commerce,

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Illinois, had been built up by the Saints, and

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
here the headquarters of the Church had been

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
established. 
1–14, Joseph Smith is commanded to

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
make a solemn proclamation of the gospel to the

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
president of the United States, the governors, and

16
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the rulers of all nations; 
15–21, Hyrum Smith,

17
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
David W. Patten, Joseph Smith Sr., and others

18
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
among the living and the dead are blessed for

19
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
their integrity and virtues; 
22–28, The Saints are

20
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
commanded to build both a house for the

21
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
entertainment of strangers and a temple in Nauvoo;

22
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
29–36, Baptisms for the dead are to be performed in

23
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
temples; 
37–44, The Lord’s people always build

24
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
temples for the performance of holy ordinances;

25
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
45–55, The Saints are excused from building the

26
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
temple in Jackson County because of the

27
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
oppression of their enemies; 
56–83, Directions are

28
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
given for the building of the Nauvoo House; 
84–96,

29
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Hyrum Smith is called to be a patriarch, to

30
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
receive the keys, and to stand in the place of

31
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Oliver Cowdery; 
97–122, William Law and others are

32
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
counseled in their labors; 
123–45, General and

33
00:00:00,0 --> 04:11:36,
local officers are named, along with their duties and quorum affiliations. 

34
04:11:36,0 --> 04:11:36,0
1 Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you, my

35
04:11:36,0 --> 04:11:36,0
servant Joseph Smith, I am well pleased

36
04:11:36,0 --> 04:11:36,0
with your offering and acknowledgments,

37
04:11:36,0 --> 04:11:36,0
which you have made; for unto this end have I

38
04:11:36,0 --> 04:11:36,0
raised you up, that I might show forth my

39
04:11:36,0 --> 04:36:37,
wisdom through the weak things of the earth.

40
04:36:37,0 --> 04:36:37,0
2 Your prayers are acceptable before

41
04:36:37,0 --> 04:36:37,0
me; and in answer to them I say unto you,

42
04:36:37,0 --> 04:36:37,0
that you are now called immediately to

43
04:36:37,0 --> 04:36:37,0
make a solemn proclamation of my

44
04:36:37,0 --> 04:36:37,0
gospel, and of this stake which I have

45
04:36:37,0 --> 04:36:37,0
planted to be a cornerstone of Zion, which

46
04:36:37,0 --> 04:36:37,0
shall be polished with the refinement

47
04:36:37,0 --> 05:07:37,
which is after the similitude of a palace.

48
05:07:37,0 --> 05:07:37,0
3 This proclamation shall be made

49
05:07:37,0 --> 05:07:37,0
to all the kings of the world, to

50
05:07:37,0 --> 05:07:37,0
the four corners thereof, to the

51
05:07:37,0 --> 05:07:37,0
honorable president-elect, and the

52
05:07:37,0 --> 05:07:37,0
high-minded governors of the

53
05:07:37,0 --> 05:07:37,0
nation in which you live, and to all

54
05:07:37,0 --> 05:38:37,
the nations of the earth scattered abroad.

55
05:38:37,0 --> 05:38:37,0
4 Let it be written in the

56
05:38:37,0 --> 05:38:37,0
spirit of meekness and by the

57
05:38:37,0 --> 05:38:37,0
power of the Holy Ghost,

58
05:38:37,0 --> 05:38:37,0
which shall be in you at the

59
05:38:37,0 --> 05:35:43,
time of the writing of the same;

60
05:35:43,0 --> 05:35:43,0
5 For it shall be given

61
05:35:43,0 --> 05:35:43,0
you by the Holy Ghost to

62
05:35:43,0 --> 05:35:43,0
know my will concerning

63
05:35:43,0 --> 05:35:43,0
those kings and

64
05:35:43,0 --> 05:35:43,0
authorities, even what shall

65
05:35:43,0 --> 05:39:50,
befall them in a time to come.

66
05:39:50,0 --> 05:39:50,0
6 For, behold, I am

67
05:39:50,0 --> 05:39:50,0
about to call upon

68
05:39:50,0 --> 05:39:50,0
them to give heed to the

69
05:39:50,0 --> 05:39:50,0
light and glory of

70
05:39:50,0 --> 05:39:50,0
Zion, for the set time

71
05:39:50,0 --> 05:39:56,
has come to favor her.

72
05:39:56,0 --> 05:39:56,0
7 Call ye,

73
05:39:56,0 --> 05:39:56,0
therefore, upon them with

74
05:39:56,0 --> 05:39:56,0
loud proclamation, and

75
05:39:56,0 --> 05:39:56,0
with your testimony,

76
05:39:56,0 --> 05:39:56,0
fearing them not,

77
05:39:56,0 --> 05:39:56,0
for they are as

78
05:39:56,0 --> 05:39:56,0
grass, and all their

79
05:39:56,0 --> 05:39:56,0
glory as the flower

80
05:39:56,0 --> 05:39:56,0
thereof which soon

81
05:39:56,0 --> 05:39:56,0
falleth, that they may be

82
05:39:56,0 --> 05:39:34,
left also without excuse—

83
05:39:34,0 --> 05:39:34,0
8 And that I may

84
05:39:34,0 --> 05:39:34,0
visit them in the day

85
05:39:34,0 --> 05:39:34,0
of visitation,

86
05:39:34,0 --> 05:39:34,0
when I shall unveil

87
05:39:34,0 --> 05:39:34,0
the face of my

88
05:39:34,0 --> 05:39:34,0
covering, to appoint the

89
05:39:34,0 --> 05:39:34,0
portion of the

90
05:39:34,0 --> 05:39:34,0
oppressor among

91
05:39:34,0 --> 05:39:34,0
hypocrites, where there is

92
05:39:34,0 --> 05:39:34,0
gnashing of teeth,

93
05:39:34,0 --> 05:39:34,0
if they reject my

94
05:39:34,0 --> 05:39:34,0
servants and my

95
05:39:34,0 --> 05:39:34,0
testimony which I have

96
05:39:34,0 --> 05:38:38,
revealed unto them.

97
05:38:38,0 --> 05:38:38,0
9 And again, I

98
05:38:38,0 --> 05:38:38,0
will visit and soften

99
05:38:38,0 --> 05:38:38,0
their hearts,

100
05:38:38,0 --> 05:38:38,0
many of them for your

101
05:38:38,0 --> 05:38:38,0
good, that ye may

102
05:38:38,0 --> 05:38:38,0
find grace in

103
05:38:38,0 --> 05:38:38,0
their eyes, that they

104
05:38:38,0 --> 05:38:38,0
may come to the

105
05:38:38,0 --> 05:38:38,0
light of truth, and

106
05:38:38,0 --> 05:38:38,0
the Gentiles to

107
05:38:38,0 --> 05:38:38,0
the exaltation or

108
05:38:38,0 --> 05:35:44,
lifting up of Zion.

109
05:35:44,0 --> 05:35:44,0
10 For the day of

110
05:35:44,0 --> 05:35:44,0
my visitation

111
05:35:44,0 --> 05:35:44,0
cometh speedily, in

112
05:35:44,0 --> 05:35:44,0
an hour when ye

113
05:35:44,0 --> 05:35:44,0
think not of; and

114
05:35:44,0 --> 05:35:44,0
where shall be

115
05:35:44,0 --> 05:35:44,0
the safety of my

116
05:35:44,0 --> 05:35:44,0
people, and refuge

117
05:35:44,0 --> 05:35:44,0
for those who

118
05:35:44,0 --> 05:39:51,
shall be left of them?

119
05:39:51,0 --> 05:39:51,0
11 Awake, O

120
05:39:51,0 --> 05:39:51,0
kings of the earth!

121
05:39:51,0 --> 05:39:51,0
Come ye, O, come

122
05:39:51,0 --> 05:39:51,0
ye, with your

123
05:39:51,0 --> 05:39:51,0
gold and your

124
05:39:51,0 --> 05:39:51,0
silver, to the help

125
05:39:51,0 --> 05:39:51,0
of my people,

126
05:39:51,0 --> 05:39:51,0
to the house of

127
05:39:51,0 --> 05:39:57,
the daughters of Zion.

128
05:39:57,0 --> 05:39:57,0
12 And again,

129
05:39:57,0 --> 05:39:57,0
verily I say

130
05:39:57,0 --> 05:39:57,0
unto you, let my

131
05:39:57,0 --> 05:39:57,0
servant

132
05:39:57,0 --> 05:39:57,0
Robert B. Thompson help

133
05:39:57,0 --> 05:39:57,0
you to write

134
05:39:57,0 --> 05:39:57,0
this

135
05:39:57,0 --> 05:39:57,0
proclamation, for I am

136
05:39:57,0 --> 05:39:57,0
well pleased with

137
05:39:57,0 --> 05:39:57,0
him, and that

138
05:39:57,0 --> 05:39:35,
he should be with you;

139
05:39:35,0 --> 05:39:35,0
13 Let him,

140
05:39:35,0 --> 05:39:35,0
therefore,

141
05:39:35,0 --> 05:39:35,0
hearken to your

142
05:39:35,0 --> 05:39:35,0
counsel, and I

143
05:39:35,0 --> 05:39:35,0
will bless him

144
05:39:35,0 --> 05:39:35,0
with a

145
05:39:35,0 --> 05:39:35,0
multiplicity of

146
05:39:35,0 --> 05:39:35,0
blessings; let him

147
05:39:35,0 --> 05:39:35,0
be faithful and

148
05:39:35,0 --> 05:39:35,0
true in all

149
05:39:35,0 --> 05:39:35,0
things from

150
05:39:35,0 --> 05:39:35,0
henceforth, and

151
05:39:35,0 --> 05:39:35,0
he shall be

152
05:39:35,0 --> 05:38:39,
great in mine eyes;

153
05:38:39,0 --> 05:38:39,0
14 But let

154
05:38:39,0 --> 05:38:39,0
him remember

155
05:38:39,0 --> 05:38:39,0
that his

156
05:38:39,0 --> 05:38:39,0
stewardship

157
05:38:39,0 --> 05:38:39,0
will I require

158
05:38:39,0 --> 05:35:45,
at his hands.

159
05:35:45,0 --> 05:35:45,0
15 And

160
05:35:45,0 --> 05:35:45,0
again, verily I

161
05:35:45,0 --> 05:35:45,0
say unto

162
05:35:45,0 --> 05:35:45,0
you, blessed

163
05:35:45,0 --> 05:35:45,0
is my

164
05:35:45,0 --> 05:35:45,0
servant Hyrum

165
05:35:45,0 --> 05:35:45,0
Smith; for

166
05:35:45,0 --> 05:35:45,0
I, the Lord,

167
05:35:45,0 --> 05:35:45,0
love him

168
05:35:45,0 --> 05:35:45,0
because of

169
05:35:45,0 --> 05:35:45,0
the

170
05:35:45,0 --> 05:35:45,0
integrity of his

171
05:35:45,0 --> 05:35:45,0
heart, and

172
05:35:45,0 --> 05:35:45,0
because he

173
05:35:45,0 --> 05:35:45,0
loveth that

174
05:35:45,0 --> 05:35:45,0
which is

175
05:35:45,0 --> 05:35:45,0
right before

176
05:35:45,0 --> 05:39:52,
me, saith the Lord.

177
05:39:52,0 --> 05:39:52,0
16 Again,

178
05:39:52,0 --> 05:39:52,0
let my

179
05:39:52,0 --> 05:39:52,0
servant

180
05:39:52,0 --> 05:39:52,0
John C. Bennett

181
05:39:52,0 --> 05:39:52,0
help you

182
05:39:52,0 --> 05:39:52,0
in your

183
05:39:52,0 --> 05:39:52,0
labor in

184
05:39:52,0 --> 05:39:52,0
sending my

185
05:39:52,0 --> 05:39:52,0
word to the

186
05:39:52,0 --> 05:39:52,0
kings and

187
05:39:52,0 --> 05:39:52,0
people of

188
05:39:52,0 --> 05:39:52,0
the earth,

189
05:39:52,0 --> 05:39:52,0
and stand

190

even you my

192
05:39:52,0 --> 05:39:52,0

05:39:52,0 --> 05:39:52,0
Joseph

194
05:39:52,0 --> 05:39:52,0
Smith, in the

195
05:39:52,0 --> 05:39:52,0
hour of

196
05:39:52,0 --> 05:39:52,0
affliction;

197
05:39:52,0 --> 05:39:52,0
and his

198
05:39:52,0 --> 05:39:52,0
reward shall

199
05:39:52,0 --> 05:39:58,
not fail if he receive counsel.

200
05:39:58,0 --> 05:39:58,0
17 And

201
05:39:58,0 --> 05:39:58,0
for his

202
05:39:58,0 --> 05:39:58,0
love he

203
05:39:58,0 --> 05:39:58,0
shall be

204
05:39:58,0 --> 05:39:58,0
great, for he

205
05:39:58,0 --> 05:39:58,0
shall be

206
05:39:58,0 --> 05:39:58,0
mine if

05:39:58,0 --> 05:39:58,0
this, saith

209
05:39:58,0 --> 05:39:58,0
the Lord.

210
05:39:58,0 --> 05:39:58,0
I have

211
05:39:58,0 --> 05:39:58,0
seen the

212
05:39:58,0 --> 05:39:58,0
work which

213
05:39:58,0 --> 05:39:58,0
he hath

214
05:39:58,0 --> 05:39:58,0
done,

215
05:39:58,0 --> 05:39:58,0
