1
00:00:11,078 --> 00:00:19,351
Section 19 Revelation given through Joseph Smith,

2
00:00:19,351 --> 00:00:27,624
 at Manchester, New York, likely in the summer of

3
00:00:27,624 --> 00:00:35,897
 1829. In his history, the Prophet introduces it as

4
00:00:35,897 --> 00:00:44,17
 “a commandment of God and not of man, to Martin

5
00:00:44,17 --> 00:00:52,443
 Harris, given by him who is Eternal.” 
1–3, Christ

6
00:00:52,443 --> 00:01:00,716
 has all power; 
4–5, All men must repent or suffer;

7
00:01:00,716 --> 00:01:08,989
6–12, Eternal punishment is God’s punishment;

8
00:01:08,989 --> 00:01:17,262
13–20, Christ suffered for all, that they might not

9
00:01:17,262 --> 00:01:25,535
 suffer if they would repent; 
21–28, Preach the

10
00:01:25,535 --> 00:01:33,808
 gospel of repentance; 
29–41, Declare glad tidings.

11
00:01:33,808 --> 00:01:42,081


12
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:47,235
1 I am Alpha and Omega, Christ the Lord; yea, even

13
00:01:47,235 --> 00:01:52,235
 I am he, the beginning and the end, the Redeemer

14
00:01:52,235 --> 00:01:57,235
 of the world

15
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:02,218
2 I, having accomplished and finished the will of

16
00:02:02,218 --> 00:02:06,718
 him whose I am, even the Father, concerning

17
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:11,218
 me—having done this that I might subdue all things unto

18
00:02:11,218 --> 00:02:15,718
 myself

19
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:20,502
3 Retaining all power, even to the destroying of

20
00:02:20,502 --> 00:02:26,002
 Satan and his works at the end of the world, and

21
00:02:26,002 --> 00:02:31,502
 the last great day of judgment, which I shall pass

22
00:02:31,502 --> 00:02:37,002
 upon the inhabitants thereof, judging every man

23
00:02:37,002 --> 00:02:42,502
 according to his works and the deeds which he hath

24
00:02:42,502 --> 00:02:48,002
 done

25
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:55,968
4 And surely every man must repent or suffer, for

26
00:02:55,968 --> 00:03:03,468
 I, God, am endless

27
00:03:03,95 --> 00:03:10,7
5 Wherefore, I revoke not the judgments which I

28
00:03:10,7 --> 00:03:17,45
 shall pass, but woes shall go forth, weeping,

29
00:03:17,45 --> 00:03:24,2
 wailing and gnashing of teeth, yea, to those who are

30
00:03:24,2 --> 00:03:30,95
 found on my left hand

31
00:03:30,21 --> 00:03:36,21
6 Nevertheless, it is not written that there shall

32
00:03:36,21 --> 00:03:42,21
 be no end to this torment, but it is written

33
00:03:42,21 --> 00:03:48,21
 endless torment

34
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:54,495
7 Again, it is written eternal damnation;

35
00:03:54,495 --> 00:04:00,495
 wherefore it is more express than other scriptures, that

36
00:04:00,495 --> 00:04:06,495
 it might work upon the hearts of the children of

37
00:04:06,495 --> 00:04:12,495
 men, altogether for my name’s glory

38
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:16,752
8 Wherefore, I will explain unto you this mystery,

39
00:04:16,752 --> 00:04:21,085
 for it is meet unto you to know even as mine

40
00:04:21,085 --> 00:04:25,418
 apostles

41
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:33,932
9 I speak unto you that are chosen in this thing,

42
00:04:33,932 --> 00:04:41,932
 even as one, that you may enter into my rest

43
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:48,931
10 For, behold, the mystery of godliness, how

44
00:04:48,931 --> 00:04:56,681
 great is it! For, behold, I am endless, and the

45
00:04:56,681 --> 00:05:04,431
 punishment which is given from my hand is endless

46
00:05:04,431 --> 00:05:12,181
 punishment, for Endless is my name. Wherefore

47
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:17,612
11 Eternal punishment is God’s punishment

48
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:25,217
12 Endless punishment is God’s punishment

49
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:30,792
13 Wherefore, I command you to repent, and keep

50
00:05:30,792 --> 00:05:35,792
 the commandments which you have received by the hand

51
00:05:35,792 --> 00:05:40,792
 of my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., in my name

52
00:05:40,54 --> 00:05:44,54
14 And it is by my almighty power that you have

53
00:05:44,54 --> 00:05:48,54
 received them

54
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:57,382
15 Therefore I command you to repent—repent, lest

55
00:05:57,382 --> 00:06:06,182
 I smite you by the rod of my mouth, and by my

56
00:06:06,182 --> 00:06:14,982
 wrath, and by my anger, and your sufferings be

57
00:06:14,982 --> 00:06:23,782
 sore—how sore you know not, how exquisite you know not,

58
00:06:23,782 --> 00:06:32,582
 yea, how hard to bear you know not

59
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:38,125
16 For behold, I, God, have suffered these things

60
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:43,458
 for all, that they might not suffer if they would

61
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:48,791
 repent

62
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:52,742
17 But if they would not repent they must suffer

63
00:06:52,742 --> 00:06:56,742
 even as I

64
00:06:56,716 --> 00:07:05,316
18 Which suffering caused myself, even God, the

65
00:07:05,316 --> 00:07:13,916
 greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to

66
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:22,516
 bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and

67
00:07:22,516 --> 00:07:31,116
 spirit—and would that I might not drink the bitter

68
00:07:31,116 --> 00:07:39,716
 cup, and shrink

69
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:45,492
19 Nevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I

70
00:07:45,492 --> 00:07:51,825
 partook and finished my preparations unto the

71
00:07:51,825 --> 00:07:58,158
 children of men

72
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:06,978
20 Wherefore, I command you again to repent, lest

73
00:08:06,978 --> 00:08:15,311
 I humble you with my almighty power; and that you

74
00:08:15,311 --> 00:08:23,644
 confess your sins, lest you suffer these

75
00:08:23,644 --> 00:08:31,977
 punishments of which I have spoken, of which in the

76
00:08:31,977 --> 00:08:40,31
 smallest, yea, even in the least degree you have tasted

77
00:08:40,31 --> 00:08:48,643
 at the time I withdrew my Spirit

78
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:54,294
21 And I command you that you preach naught but

79
00:08:54,294 --> 00:09:00,294
 repentance, and show not these things unto the world

80
00:09:00,294 --> 00:09:06,294
 until it is wisdom in me

81
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:13,579
22 For they cannot bear meat now, but milk they

82
00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:20,579
 must receive; wherefore, they must not know these

83
00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:27,579
 things, lest they perish

84
00:09:27,1 --> 00:09:32,433
23 Learn of me, and listen to my words; walk in

85
00:09:32,433 --> 00:09:37,766
 the meekness of my Spirit, and you shall have peace

86
00:09:37,766 --> 00:09:43,099
 in me

87
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:50,149
24 I am Jesus Christ; I came by the will of the

88
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:57,149
 Father, and I do his will

89
00:09:57,664 --> 00:10:02,331
25 And again, I command thee that thou shalt not

90
00:10:02,331 --> 00:10:06,998
 covet thy neighbor’s wife; nor seek thy neighbor’s

91
00:10:06,998 --> 00:10:11,665
 life

92
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:16,144
26 And again, I command thee that thou shalt not

93
00:10:16,144 --> 00:10:20,644
 covet thine own property, but impart it freely to

94
00:10:20,644 --> 00:10:25,144
 the printing of the Book of Mormon, which contains

95
00:10:25,144 --> 00:10:29,644
 the truth and the word of God

96
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:37,429
27 Which is my word to the Gentile, that soon it

97
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:44,929
 may go to the Jew, of whom the Lamanites are a

98
00:10:44,929 --> 00:10:52,429
 remnant, that they may believe the gospel, and look

99
00:10:52,429 --> 00:10:59,929
 not for a Messiah to come who has already come

100
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:05,959
28 And again, I command thee that thou shalt pray

101
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:12,459
 vocally as well as in thy heart; yea, before the

102
00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:18,959
 world as well as in secret, in public as well as in

103
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:25,459
 private

104
00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:32,002
29 And thou shalt declare glad tidings, yea,

105
00:11:32,002 --> 00:11:38,252
 publish it upon the mountains, and upon every high

106
00:11:38,252 --> 00:11:44,502
 place, and among every people that thou shalt be

107
00:11:44,502 --> 00:11:50,752
 permitted to see

108
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:56,243
30 And thou shalt do it with all humility,

109
00:11:56,243 --> 00:12:01,743
 trusting in me, reviling not against revilers

110
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:06,804
31 And of tenets thou shalt not talk, but thou

111
00:12:06,804 --> 00:12:12,554
 shalt declare repentance and faith on the Savior, and

112
00:12:12,554 --> 00:12:18,304
 remission of sins by baptism, and by fire, yea,

113
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:24,054
 even the Holy Ghost

114
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:28,027
32 Behold, this is a great and the last

115
00:12:28,027 --> 00:12:31,777
 commandment which I shall give unto you concerning this

116
00:12:31,777 --> 00:12:35,527
 matter; for this shall suffice for thy daily walk,

117
00:12:35,527 --> 00:12:39,277
 even unto the end of thy life

118
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:45,993
33 And misery thou shalt receive if thou wilt

119
00:12:45,993 --> 00:12:51,993
 slight these counsels, yea, even the destruction of

120
00:12:51,993 --> 00:12:57,993
 thyself and property

121
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:02,977
34 Impart a portion of thy property, yea, even

122
00:13:02,977 --> 00:13:07,977
 part of thy lands, and all save the support of thy

123
00:13:07,977 --> 00:13:12,977
 family

124
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:16,992
35 Pay the debt thou hast contracted with the

125
00:13:16,992 --> 00:13:21,492
 printer. Release thyself from bondage

126
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:26,801
36 Leave thy house and home, except when thou

127
00:13:26,801 --> 00:13:31,801
 shalt desire to see thy family

128
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:37,844
37 And speak freely to all; yea, preach, exhort,

129
00:13:37,844 --> 00:13:44,344
 declare the truth, even with a loud voice, with a

130
00:13:44,344 --> 00:13:50,844
 sound of rejoicing, crying—Hosanna, hosanna,

131
00:13:50,844 --> 00:13:57,344
 blessed be the name of the Lord God

132
00:13:57,37 --> 00:14:03,87
38 Pray always, and I will pour out my Spirit upon

133
00:14:03,87 --> 00:14:10,37
 you, and great shall be your blessing—yea, even

134
00:14:10,37 --> 00:14:16,87
 more than if you should obtain treasures of earth

135
00:14:16,87 --> 00:14:23,37
 and corruptibleness to the extent thereof

136
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:27,396
39 Behold, canst thou read this without rejoicing

137
00:14:27,396 --> 00:14:31,396
 and lifting up thy heart for gladness

138
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:37,771
40 Or canst thou run about longer as a blind

139
00:14:37,771 --> 00:14:43,771
 guide

140
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:49,282
41 Or canst thou be humble and meek, and conduct

141
00:14:49,282 --> 00:14:55,282
 thyself wisely before me? Yea, come unto me thy

142
00:14:55,282 --> 00:15:01,282
 Savior. Amen.
