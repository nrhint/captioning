1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 19 Revelation given through Joseph

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Smith, at Manchester, New York, likely in the

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
summer of 1829. In his history, the Prophet

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
introduces it as “a commandment of God and not

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of man, to Martin Harris, given by him who is

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Eternal.” 
1–3, Christ has all power; 
4–5,

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
All men must repent or suffer; 
6–12, Eternal

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
punishment is God’s punishment; 
13–20,

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Christ suffered for all, that they might not

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
suffer if they would repent; 
21–28, Preach the

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:50:44,
gospel of repentance; 
29–41, Declare glad tidings. 

12
00:50:44,0 --> 00:50:44,0
1 I am Alpha and Omega, Christ the

13
00:50:44,0 --> 00:50:44,0
Lord; yea, even I am he, the beginning

14
00:50:44,0 --> 00:57:52,
and the end, the Redeemer of the world.

15
00:57:52,0 --> 00:57:52,0
2 I, having accomplished and

16
00:57:52,0 --> 00:57:52,0
finished the will of him whose I

17
00:57:52,0 --> 00:57:52,0
am, even the Father, concerning

18
00:57:52,0 --> 00:57:52,0
me—having done this that I

19
00:57:52,0 --> 01:07:02,
might subdue all things unto myself—

20
01:07:02,0 --> 01:07:02,0
3 Retaining all power, even

21
01:07:02,0 --> 01:07:02,0
to the destroying of Satan

22
01:07:02,0 --> 01:07:02,0
and his works at the end of

23
01:07:02,0 --> 01:07:02,0
the world, and the last great

24
01:07:02,0 --> 01:07:02,0
day of judgment, which I

25
01:07:02,0 --> 01:07:02,0
shall pass upon the

26
01:07:02,0 --> 01:07:02,0
inhabitants thereof, judging every man

27
01:07:02,0 --> 01:07:02,0
according to his works and

28
01:07:02,0 --> 01:23:42,
the deeds which he hath done.

29
01:23:42,0 --> 01:23:42,0
4 And surely every man

30
01:23:42,0 --> 01:23:42,0
must repent or suffer,

31
01:23:42,0 --> 01:31:26,
for I, God, am endless.

32
01:31:26,0 --> 01:31:26,0
5 Wherefore, I revoke

33
01:31:26,0 --> 01:31:26,0
not the judgments

34
01:31:26,0 --> 01:31:26,0
which I shall pass, but

35
01:31:26,0 --> 01:31:26,0
woes shall go forth,

36
01:31:26,0 --> 01:31:26,0
weeping, wailing and

37
01:31:26,0 --> 01:31:26,0
gnashing of teeth,

38
01:31:26,0 --> 01:31:26,0
yea, to those who are

39
01:31:26,0 --> 01:44:35,
found on my left hand.

40
01:44:35,0 --> 01:44:35,0
6 Nevertheless, it

41
01:44:35,0 --> 01:44:35,0
is not written

42
01:44:35,0 --> 01:44:35,0
that there shall be

43
01:44:35,0 --> 01:44:35,0
no end to this

44
01:44:35,0 --> 01:44:35,0
torment, but it is

45
01:44:35,0 --> 01:53:45,
written endless torment.

46
01:53:45,0 --> 01:53:45,0
7 Again, it is

47
01:53:45,0 --> 01:53:45,0
written eternal

48
01:53:45,0 --> 01:53:45,0
damnation;

49
01:53:45,0 --> 01:53:45,0
wherefore it is more

50
01:53:45,0 --> 01:53:45,0
express than

51
01:53:45,0 --> 01:53:45,0
other scriptures,

52
01:53:45,0 --> 01:53:45,0
that it might work

53
01:53:45,0 --> 01:53:45,0
upon the hearts

54
01:53:45,0 --> 01:53:45,0
of the children

55
01:53:45,0 --> 01:53:45,0
of men,

56
01:53:45,0 --> 02:05:28,
altogether for my name’s glory.

57
02:05:28,0 --> 02:05:28,0
8 Wherefore, I

58
02:05:28,0 --> 02:05:28,0
will explain

59
02:05:28,0 --> 02:05:28,0
unto you this

60
02:05:28,0 --> 02:05:28,0
mystery, for it is

61
02:05:28,0 --> 02:05:28,0
meet unto you

62
02:05:28,0 --> 02:05:28,0
to know even as

63
02:05:28,0 --> 02:12:37,
mine apostles.

64
02:12:37,0 --> 02:12:37,0
9 I speak

65
02:12:37,0 --> 02:12:37,0
unto you that

66
02:12:37,0 --> 02:12:37,0
are chosen in

67
02:12:37,0 --> 02:12:37,0
this thing,

68
02:12:37,0 --> 02:12:37,0
even as one,

69
02:12:37,0 --> 02:12:37,0
that you may

70
02:12:37,0 --> 02:20:07,
enter into my rest.

71
02:20:07,0 --> 02:20:07,0
10 For,

72
02:20:07,0 --> 02:20:07,0
behold, the

73
02:20:07,0 --> 02:20:07,0
mystery of

74
02:20:07,0 --> 02:20:07,0
godliness, how

75
02:20:07,0 --> 02:20:07,0
great is it!

76
02:20:07,0 --> 02:20:07,0
For, behold,

77
02:20:07,0 --> 02:20:07,0
I am

78
02:20:07,0 --> 02:20:07,0
endless, and the

79
02:20:07,0 --> 02:20:07,0
punishment

80
02:20:07,0 --> 02:20:07,0
which is given

81
02:20:07,0 --> 02:20:07,0
from my hand

82
02:20:07,0 --> 02:20:07,0
is endless

83
02:20:07,0 --> 02:20:07,0
punishment,

84
02:20:07,0 --> 02:20:07,0
for Endless

85
02:20:07,0 --> 02:19:39,
is my name. Wherefore—

86
02:19:39,0 --> 02:19:39,0
11 Eternal

87
02:19:39,0 --> 02:19:39,0


88
02:19:39,0 --> 02:19:39,0
punishment is God’s

89
02:19:39,0 --> 02:21:51,
punishment.

90
02:21:51,0 --> 02:21:51,0
12

91
02:21:51,0 --> 02:21:51,0
Endless

92
02:21:51,0 --> 02:21:51,0
punishment is

93
02:21:51,0 --> 02:21:51,0
God’s

94
02:21:51,0 --> 02:33:19,
punishment.

95
02:33:19,0 --> 02:33:19,0
13

96
02:33:19,0 --> 02:33:19,0
Wherefore,

97
02:33:19,0 --> 02:33:19,0
I

98
02:33:19,0 --> 02:33:19,0
command you

99
02:33:19,0 --> 02:33:19,0
to

100
02:33:19,0 --> 02:33:19,0
repent, and

101
02:33:19,0 --> 02:33:19,0
keep

102
02:33:19,0 --> 02:33:19,0
the

103
02:33:19,0 --> 02:33:19,0


104
02:33:19,0 --> 02:33:19,0
commandments which

105
02:33:19,0 --> 02:33:19,0
you

106
02:33:19,0 --> 02:33:19,0
have

107
02:33:19,0 --> 02:33:19,0
received by

108
02:33:19,0 --> 02:33:19,0
the

109
02:33:19,0 --> 02:33:19,0
hand of

110
02:33:19,0 --> 02:33:19,0
my

111
02:33:19,0 --> 02:33:19,0
servant

112
02:33:19,0 --> 02:33:19,0
Joseph

113
02:33:19,0 --> 02:34:31,
Smith, Jun., in my name;

114
02:34:31,0 --> 02:34:31,0
14 And

115
02:34:31,0 --> 02:34:31,0
it is

116
02:34:31,0 --> 02:34:31,0
by my

117
02:34:31,0 --> 02:34:31,0


118
02:34:31,0 --> 02:34:31,0
almighty

119
02:34:31,0 --> 02:34:31,0
power

120
02:34:31,0 --> 02:34:31,0
that you

121
02:34:31,0 --> 02:34:31,0
have

122
02:34:31,0 --> 02:38:16,
received them;

123
02:38:16,0 --> 02:38:16,0
15

124
02:38:16,0 --> 02:38:16,0
Therefore

125
02:38:16,0 --> 02:38:16,0
I

126
02:38:16,0 --> 02:38:16,0
command

127
02:38:16,0 --> 02:38:16,0
you to

128
02:38:16,0 --> 02:38:16,0


129
02:38:16,0 --> 02:38:16,0


130
02:38:16,0 --> 02:38:16,0
repent—repent,

131
02:38:16,0 --> 02:38:16,0
lest I

132
02:38:16,0 --> 02:38:16,0
smite

133
02:38:16,0 --> 02:38:16,0
you by

134
02:38:16,0 --> 02:38:16,0
the rod

135
02:38:16,0 --> 02:38:16,0
of my

136
02:38:16,0 --> 02:38:16,0


137
02:38:16,0 --> 02:38:16,0
mouth, and

138
02:38:16,0 --> 02:38:16,0
by my

139
02:38:16,0 --> 02:38:16,0
wrath,

140
02:38:16,0 --> 02:38:16,0
and

141
02:38:16,0 --> 02:38:16,0
by my

142
02:38:16,0 --> 02:38:16,0
anger,

143
02:38:16,0 --> 02:38:16,0
and

144
02:38:16,0 --> 02:38:16,0
your

145
02:38:16,0 --> 02:38:16,0


146
02:38:16,0 --> 02:38:16,0
sufferings be

147
02:38:16,0 --> 02:38:16,0


148
02:38:16,0 --> 02:38:16,0
sore—how sore

149
02:38:16,0 --> 02:38:16,0
you

150
02:38:16,0 --> 02:38:16,0
know

151
02:38:16,0 --> 02:38:16,0
not, how

152
02:38:16,0 --> 02:38:16,0


153
02:38:16,0 --> 02:38:16,0
exquisite

154
02:38:16,0 --> 02:38:16,0
you

155
02:38:16,0 --> 02:38:16,0
know not,

156
02:38:16,0 --> 02:38:16,0
yea,

157
02:38:16,0 --> 02:38:16,0
how

158
02:38:16,0 --> 02:38:16,0
hard to

159
02:38:16,0 --> 02:38:16,0
bear

160
02:38:16,0 --> 02:38:16,0
you

161
02:38:16,0 --> 02:42:29,
know not.

162
02:42:29,0 --> 02:42:29,0
16

163
02:42:29,0 --> 02:42:29,0
For

164
02:42:29,0 --> 02:42:29,0
behold,

165
02:42:29,0 --> 02:42:29,0
I,

166
02:42:29,0 --> 02:42:29,0
God,

167
02:42:29,0 --> 02:42:29,0
have

168
02:42:29,0 --> 02:42:29,0


169
02:42:29,0 --> 02:42:29,0
suffered

170
02:42:29,0 --> 02:42:29,0
these

171
02:42:29,0 --> 02:42:29,0
things

172
02:42:29,0 --> 02:42:29,0
for

173
02:42:29,0 --> 02:42:29,0
all,

174
02:42:29,0 --> 02:42:29,0
that

175
02:42:29,0 --> 02:42:29,0
they

176
02:42:29,0 --> 02:42:29,0
might

177
02:42:29,0 --> 02:42:29,0
not

178
02:42:29,0 --> 02:42:29,0
suffer

179
02:42:29,0 --> 02:49:59,
if they would repent;

180
02:49:59,0 --> 02:49:59,0
17

181
02:49:59,0 --> 02:49:59,0
But

182
02:49:59,0 --> 02:49:59,0
if

183
02:49:59,0 --> 02:49:59,0
they

184
02:49:59,0 --> 02:49:59,0
would

185
02:49:59,0 --> 02:49:59,0
not

186
02:49:59,0 --> 02:49:59,0


187
02:49:59,0 --> 02:49:59,0
repent

188
02:49:59,0 --> 02:49:59,0
they

189
02:49:59,0 --> 02:49:59,0


190
02:49:59,0 --> 02:49:59,0
must

191
02:49:59,0 --> 02:52:41,
suffer even as I;

192
02:52:41,0 --> 02:52:41,0
18

193
02:52:41,0 --> 02:52:41,0
Which

194
02:52:41,0 --> 02:52:41,0


195
02:52:41,0 --> 02:52:41,0


196
02:52:41,0 --> 02:52:41,0
suffering

197
02:52:41,0 --> 02:52:41,0


198
02:52:41,0 --> 02:52:41,0
caused

199
02:52:41,0 --> 02:52:41,0


200
02:52:41,0 --> 02:52:41,0
myself,

201
02:52:41,0 --> 02:52:41,0
even

202
02:52:41,0 --> 02:52:41,0
God,

203
02:52:41,0 --> 02:52:41,0
the

204
02:52:41,0 --> 02:52:41,0


205
02:52:41,0 --> 02:52:41,0
greatest

206
02:52:41,0 --> 02:52:41,0
of

207
02:52:41,0 --> 02:52:41,0
all,

208
02:52:41,0 --> 02:52:41,0
to

209
02:52:41,0 --> 02:52:41,0


210
02:52:41,0 --> 02:52:41,0
tremble

211
02:52:41,0 --> 02:52:41,0


212
02:52:41,0 --> 02:52:41,0
because

213
02:52:41,0 --> 02:52:41,0
of

214
02:52:41,0 --> 02:52:41,0
pain,

215
02:52:41,0 --> 02:52:41,0
and

216
02:52:41,0 --> 02:52:41,0
to

217
02:52:41,0 --> 02:52:41,0


218
02:52:41,0 --> 02:52:41,0
bleed at

219
02:52:41,0 --> 02:52:41,0


220
02:52:41,0 --> 02:52:41,0
every

221
02:52:41,0 --> 02:52:41,0
pore,

222
02:52:41,0 --> 02:52:41,0
and

223
02:52:41,0 --> 02:52:41,0
to

224
02:52:41,0 --> 02:52:41,0


225
02:52:41,0 --> 02:52:41,0
suffer

226

02:52:41,0 --> 02:52:41,0
body

228
02:52:41,0 --> 02:52:41,0

230
02:52:41,0 --> 02:52:41,0


231
02:52:41,0 --> 02:52:41,0
