00:00:26,76 --> 00:00:32,878
Section 56 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:32,878 --> 00:00:38,996
 the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, June 15, 1831. This

3
00:00:38,996 --> 00:00:45,114
 revelation chastises Ezra Thayre for not obeying

4
00:00:45,114 --> 00:00:51,232
 a former revelation (the “commandment” referred to

5
00:00:51,232 --> 00:00:57,35
 in 
verse 8), which Joseph Smith had received for

6
00:00:57,35 --> 00:01:03,468
 him, instructing Thayre concerning his duties on

7
00:01:03,468 --> 00:01:09,586
 Frederick G. Williams’ farm, where he lived. The

8
00:01:09,586 --> 00:01:15,704
 following revelation also revokes Thayre’s call to

9
00:01:15,704 --> 00:01:21,822
 travel to Missouri with Thomas B. Marsh (see

10
00:01:21,822 --> 00:01:27,94
section 52:22). 
1–2, The Saints must take up their

11
00:01:27,94 --> 00:01:34,058
 cross and follow the Lord to gain salvation; 
3–13,

12
00:01:34,058 --> 00:01:40,176
 The Lord commands and revokes, and the disobedient

13
00:01:40,176 --> 00:01:46,294
 are cast off; 
14–17, Wo unto the rich who will

14
00:01:46,294 --> 00:01:52,412
 not help the poor, and wo unto the poor whose

15
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:58,53
 hearts are not broken; 
18–20, Blessed are the poor who

16
00:01:58,53 --> 00:02:04,648
 are pure in heart, for they will inherit the

17
00:02:04,648 --> 00:02:10,766
 earth.

18
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:16,163
1 Hearken, O ye people who profess my name, saith

19
00:02:16,163 --> 00:02:22,163
 the Lord your God; for behold, mine anger is

20
00:02:22,163 --> 00:02:28,163
 kindled against the rebellious, and they shall know

21
00:02:28,163 --> 00:02:34,163
 mine arm and mine indignation, in the day of

22
00:02:34,163 --> 00:02:40,163
 visitation and of wrath upon the nations

23
00:02:40,177 --> 00:02:44,51
2 And he that will not take up his cross and

24
00:02:44,51 --> 00:02:48,843
 follow me, and keep my commandments, the same shall not

25
00:02:48,843 --> 00:02:53,176
 be saved

26
00:02:53,94 --> 00:02:59,19
3 Behold, I, the Lord, command; and he that will

27
00:02:59,19 --> 00:03:04,44
 not obey shall be cut off in mine own due time,

28
00:03:04,44 --> 00:03:09,69
 after I have commanded and the commandment is broken

29
00:03:09,69 --> 00:03:14,94


30
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:21,894
4 Wherefore I, the Lord, command and revoke, as it

31
00:03:21,894 --> 00:03:29,561
 seemeth me good; and all this to be answered upon

32
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:37,228
 the heads of the rebellious, saith the Lord

33
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:42,884
5 Wherefore, I revoke the commandment which was

34
00:03:42,884 --> 00:03:48,551
 given unto my servants Thomas B. Marsh and Ezra

35
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:54,218
 Thayre, and give a new commandment unto my servant

36
00:03:54,218 --> 00:03:59,885
 Thomas, that he shall take up his journey speedily to

37
00:03:59,885 --> 00:04:05,552
 the land of Missouri, and my servant Selah J.

38
00:04:05,552 --> 00:04:11,219
 Griffin shall also go with him

39
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:17,118
6 For behold, I revoke the commandment which was

40
00:04:17,118 --> 00:04:22,518
 given unto my servants Selah J. Griffin and Newel

41
00:04:22,518 --> 00:04:27,918
 Knight, in consequence of the stiffneckedness of my

42
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:33,318
 people which are in Thompson, and their

43
00:04:33,318 --> 00:04:38,718
 rebellions

44
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:44,761
7 Wherefore, let my servant Newel Knight remain

45
00:04:44,761 --> 00:04:51,511
 with them; and as many as will go may go, that are

46
00:04:51,511 --> 00:04:58,261
 contrite before me, and be led by him to the land

47
00:04:58,261 --> 00:05:05,011
 which I have appointed

48
00:05:05,522 --> 00:05:10,722
8 And again, verily I say unto you, that my

49
00:05:10,722 --> 00:05:15,922
 servant Ezra Thayre must repent of his pride, and of his

50
00:05:15,922 --> 00:05:21,122
 selfishness, and obey the former commandment

51
00:05:21,122 --> 00:05:26,322
 which I have given him concerning the place upon which

52
00:05:26,322 --> 00:05:31,522
 he lives

53
00:05:31,815 --> 00:05:38,148
9 And if he will do this, as there shall be no

54
00:05:38,148 --> 00:05:44,481
 divisions made upon the land, he shall be appointed

55
00:05:44,481 --> 00:05:50,814
 still to go to the land of Missouri

56
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:56,101
10 Otherwise he shall receive the money which he

57
00:05:56,101 --> 00:06:01,351
 has paid, and shall leave the place, and shall be

58
00:06:01,351 --> 00:06:06,601
 cut off out of my church, saith the Lord God of

59
00:06:06,601 --> 00:06:11,851
 hosts

60
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:16,137
11 And though the heaven and the earth pass away,

61
00:06:16,137 --> 00:06:21,137
 these words shall not pass away, but shall be

62
00:06:21,137 --> 00:06:26,137
 fulfilled

63
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:32,687
12 And if my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., must

64
00:06:32,687 --> 00:06:38,487
 needs pay the money, behold, I, the Lord, will pay it

65
00:06:38,487 --> 00:06:44,286
 unto him again in the land of Missouri, that those

66
00:06:44,286 --> 00:06:50,087
 of whom he shall receive may be rewarded again

67
00:06:50,087 --> 00:06:55,887
 according to that which they do

68
00:06:55,165 --> 00:07:00,165
13 For according to that which they do they shall

69
00:07:00,165 --> 00:07:05,165
 receive, even in lands for their inheritance

70
00:07:05,942 --> 00:07:10,942
14 Behold, thus saith the Lord unto my people—you

71
00:07:10,942 --> 00:07:15,942
 have many things to do and to repent of; for

72
00:07:15,942 --> 00:07:20,942
 behold, your sins have come up unto me, and are not

73
00:07:20,942 --> 00:07:25,942
 pardoned, because you seek to counsel in your own

74
00:07:25,942 --> 00:07:30,942
 ways

75
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:34,483
15 And your hearts are not satisfied. And ye obey

76
00:07:34,483 --> 00:07:38,483
 not the truth, but have pleasure in

77
00:07:38,483 --> 00:07:42,483
 unrighteousness

78
00:07:42,245 --> 00:07:49,578
16 Wo unto you rich men, that will not give your

79
00:07:49,578 --> 00:07:56,911
 substance to the poor, for your riches will canker

80
00:07:56,911 --> 00:08:04,244
 your souls; and this shall be your lamentation in

81
00:08:04,244 --> 00:08:11,577
 the day of visitation, and of judgment, and of

82
00:08:11,577 --> 00:08:18,91
 indignation: The harvest is past, the summer is

83
00:08:18,91 --> 00:08:26,243
 ended, and my soul is not saved

84
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:31,873
17 Wo unto you poor men, whose hearts are not

85
00:08:31,873 --> 00:08:37,54
 broken, whose spirits are not contrite, and whose

86
00:08:37,54 --> 00:08:43,207
 bellies are not satisfied, and whose hands are not

87
00:08:43,207 --> 00:08:48,874
 stayed from laying hold upon other men’s goods, whose

88
00:08:48,874 --> 00:08:54,541
 eyes are full of greediness, and who will not

89
00:08:54,541 --> 00:09:00,208
 labor with your own hands

90
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:06,757
18 But blessed are the poor who are pure in heart,

91
00:09:06,757 --> 00:09:12,557
 whose hearts are broken, and whose spirits are

92
00:09:12,557 --> 00:09:18,357
 contrite, for they shall see the kingdom of God

93
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:24,157
 coming in power and great glory unto their

94
00:09:24,157 --> 00:09:29,957
 deliverance; for the fatness of the earth shall be theirs

95
00:09:29,953 --> 00:09:35,953
19 For behold, the Lord shall come, and his

96
00:09:35,953 --> 00:09:41,953
 recompense shall be with him, and he shall reward every

97
00:09:41,953 --> 00:09:47,953
 man, and the poor shall rejoice

98
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:52,237
20 And their generations shall inherit the earth

99
00:09:52,237 --> 00:09:56,987
 from generation to generation, forever and ever.

100
00:09:56,987 --> 00:10:01,737
 And now I make an end of speaking unto you. Even so.

101
00:10:01,737 --> 00:10:06,487
 Amen.
