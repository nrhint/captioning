00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 56 Revelation given through Joseph

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, June 15,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
1831. This revelation chastises Ezra Thayre for not

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
obeying a former revelation (the “commandment”

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
referred to in 
verse 8), which Joseph Smith

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
had received for him, instructing Thayre

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
concerning his duties on Frederick G. Williams’ farm,

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
where he lived. The following revelation also

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
revokes Thayre’s call to travel to Missouri with

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Thomas B. Marsh (see 
section 52:22). 
1–2,

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
The Saints must take up their cross and follow

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Lord to gain salvation; 
3–13, The Lord

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
commands and revokes, and the disobedient are cast

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
off; 
14–17, Wo unto the rich who will not help

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the poor, and wo unto the poor whose hearts are

16
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
not broken; 
18–20, Blessed are the poor who

17
00:00:00,0 --> 02:08:48,
are pure in heart, for they will inherit the earth. 

18
02:08:48,0 --> 02:08:48,0
1 Hearken, O ye people who profess my name,

19
02:08:48,0 --> 02:08:48,0
saith the Lord your God; for behold, mine anger

20
02:08:48,0 --> 02:08:48,0
is kindled against the rebellious, and they

21
02:08:48,0 --> 02:08:48,0
shall know mine arm and mine indignation, in the

22
02:08:48,0 --> 02:11:50,
day of visitation and of wrath upon the nations.

23
02:11:50,0 --> 02:11:50,0
2 And he that will not take up his

24
02:11:50,0 --> 02:11:50,0
cross and follow me, and keep my

25
02:11:50,0 --> 02:22:50,
commandments, the same shall not be saved.

26
02:22:50,0 --> 02:22:50,0
3 Behold, I, the Lord,

27
02:22:50,0 --> 02:22:50,0
command; and he that will not obey

28
02:22:50,0 --> 02:22:50,0
shall be cut off in mine own due

29
02:22:50,0 --> 02:22:50,0
time, after I have commanded

30
02:22:50,0 --> 02:33:51,
and the commandment is broken.

31
02:33:51,0 --> 02:33:51,0
4 Wherefore I, the Lord,

32
02:33:51,0 --> 02:33:51,0
command and revoke, as it seemeth

33
02:33:51,0 --> 02:33:51,0
me good; and all this to be

34
02:33:51,0 --> 02:33:51,0
answered upon the heads of

35
02:33:51,0 --> 02:33:57,
the rebellious, saith the Lord.

36
02:33:57,0 --> 02:33:57,0
5 Wherefore, I revoke the

37
02:33:57,0 --> 02:33:57,0
commandment which was given

38
02:33:57,0 --> 02:33:57,0
unto my servants Thomas B.

39
02:33:57,0 --> 02:33:57,0
Marsh and Ezra Thayre, and

40
02:33:57,0 --> 02:33:57,0
give a new commandment unto

41
02:33:57,0 --> 02:33:57,0
my servant Thomas, that he

42
02:33:57,0 --> 02:33:57,0
shall take up his journey

43
02:33:57,0 --> 02:33:57,0
speedily to the land of

44
02:33:57,0 --> 02:33:57,0
Missouri, and my servant

45
02:33:57,0 --> 02:33:35,
Selah J. Griffin shall also go with him.

46
02:33:35,0 --> 02:33:35,0
6 For behold, I revoke

47
02:33:35,0 --> 02:33:35,0
the commandment which was

48
02:33:35,0 --> 02:33:35,0
given unto my servants

49
02:33:35,0 --> 02:33:35,0
Selah J. Griffin and Newel

50
02:33:35,0 --> 02:33:35,0
Knight, in consequence of

51
02:33:35,0 --> 02:33:35,0
the stiffneckedness of my

52
02:33:35,0 --> 02:33:35,0
people which are in

53
02:33:35,0 --> 02:30:41,
Thompson, and their rebellions.

54
02:30:41,0 --> 02:30:41,0
7 Wherefore, let my

55
02:30:41,0 --> 02:30:41,0
servant Newel Knight remain

56
02:30:41,0 --> 02:30:41,0
with them; and as many

57
02:30:41,0 --> 02:30:41,0
as will go may go, that

58
02:30:41,0 --> 02:30:41,0
are contrite before me,

59
02:30:41,0 --> 02:30:41,0
and be led by him to the

60
02:30:41,0 --> 02:39:43,
land which I have appointed.

61
02:39:43,0 --> 02:39:43,0
8 And again, verily I

62
02:39:43,0 --> 02:39:43,0
say unto you, that my

63
02:39:43,0 --> 02:39:43,0
servant Ezra Thayre must

64
02:39:43,0 --> 02:39:43,0
repent of his pride,

65
02:39:43,0 --> 02:39:43,0
and of his selfishness,

66
02:39:43,0 --> 02:39:43,0
and obey the former

67
02:39:43,0 --> 02:39:43,0
commandment which I have

68
02:39:43,0 --> 02:39:43,0
given him concerning the

69
02:39:43,0 --> 02:46:46,
place upon which he lives.

70
02:46:46,0 --> 02:46:46,0
9 And if he will do

71
02:46:46,0 --> 02:46:46,0
this, as there shall be

72
02:46:46,0 --> 02:46:46,0
no divisions made upon

73
02:46:46,0 --> 02:46:46,0
the land, he shall be

74
02:46:46,0 --> 02:46:46,0
appointed still to go

75
02:46:46,0 --> 02:52:51,
to the land of Missouri;

76
02:52:51,0 --> 02:52:51,0
10 Otherwise he shall

77
02:52:51,0 --> 02:52:51,0
receive the money

78
02:52:51,0 --> 02:52:51,0
which he has paid, and

79
02:52:51,0 --> 02:52:51,0
shall leave the

80
02:52:51,0 --> 02:52:51,0
place, and shall be cut

81
02:52:51,0 --> 02:52:51,0
off out of my church,

82
02:52:51,0 --> 03:11:50,
saith the Lord God of hosts;

83
03:11:50,0 --> 03:11:50,0
11 And though the

84
03:11:50,0 --> 03:11:50,0
heaven and the

85
03:11:50,0 --> 03:11:50,0
earth pass away,

86
03:11:50,0 --> 03:11:50,0
these words shall

87
03:11:50,0 --> 03:11:50,0
not pass away,

88
03:11:50,0 --> 03:12:54,
but shall be fulfilled.

89
03:12:54,0 --> 03:12:54,0
12 And if my

90
03:12:54,0 --> 03:12:54,0
servant Joseph

91
03:12:54,0 --> 03:12:54,0
Smith, Jun., must

92
03:12:54,0 --> 03:12:54,0
needs pay the

93
03:12:54,0 --> 03:12:54,0
money, behold, I,

94
03:12:54,0 --> 03:12:54,0
the Lord, will pay

95
03:12:54,0 --> 03:12:54,0
it unto him

96
03:12:54,0 --> 03:12:54,0
again in the land

97
03:12:54,0 --> 03:12:54,0
of Missouri, that

98
03:12:54,0 --> 03:12:54,0
those of whom

99
03:12:54,0 --> 03:12:54,0
he shall receive

100
03:12:54,0 --> 03:12:54,0
may be rewarded

101
03:12:54,0 --> 03:12:54,0
again according

102
03:12:54,0 --> 03:35:54,
to that which they do;

103
03:35:54,0 --> 03:35:54,0
13 For

104
03:35:54,0 --> 03:35:54,0
according to that which

105
03:35:54,0 --> 03:35:54,0
they do they

106
03:35:54,0 --> 03:35:54,0
shall receive,

107
03:35:54,0 --> 03:35:54,0
even in lands

108
03:35:54,0 --> 04:11:29,
for their inheritance.

109
04:11:29,0 --> 04:11:29,0
14 Behold,

110
04:11:29,0 --> 04:11:29,0
thus saith the

111
04:11:29,0 --> 04:11:29,0
Lord unto my

112
04:11:29,0 --> 04:11:29,0
people—you have

113
04:11:29,0 --> 04:11:29,0
many things to

114
04:11:29,0 --> 04:11:29,0
do and to

115
04:11:29,0 --> 04:11:29,0
repent of; for

116
04:11:29,0 --> 04:11:29,0
behold, your sins

117
04:11:29,0 --> 04:11:29,0
have come up

118
04:11:29,0 --> 04:11:29,0
unto me, and

119
04:11:29,0 --> 04:11:29,0
are not

120
04:11:29,0 --> 04:11:29,0
pardoned, because you

121
04:11:29,0 --> 04:11:29,0
seek to

122
04:11:29,0 --> 04:21:31,
counsel in your own ways.

123
04:21:31,0 --> 04:21:31,0
15 And your

124
04:21:31,0 --> 04:21:31,0
hearts are

125
04:21:31,0 --> 04:21:31,0
not

126
04:21:31,0 --> 04:21:31,0
satisfied. And ye

127
04:21:31,0 --> 04:21:31,0
obey not the

128
04:21:31,0 --> 04:21:31,0
truth, but

129
04:21:31,0 --> 04:21:31,0
have pleasure

130
04:21:31,0 --> 04:30:34,
in unrighteousness.

131
04:30:34,0 --> 04:30:34,0
16 Wo unto

132
04:30:34,0 --> 04:30:34,0
you rich

133
04:30:34,0 --> 04:30:34,0
men, that

134
04:30:34,0 --> 04:30:34,0
will not give

135
04:30:34,0 --> 04:30:34,0
your

136
04:30:34,0 --> 04:30:34,0
substance to the

137
04:30:34,0 --> 04:30:34,0
poor, for

138
04:30:34,0 --> 04:30:34,0
your riches

139
04:30:34,0 --> 04:30:34,0
will canker

140
04:30:34,0 --> 04:30:34,0
your

141
04:30:34,0 --> 04:30:34,0
souls; and this

142
04:30:34,0 --> 04:30:34,0
shall be

143
04:30:34,0 --> 04:30:34,0
your

144
04:30:34,0 --> 04:30:34,0
lamentation in the

145
04:30:34,0 --> 04:30:34,0
day of

146
04:30:34,0 --> 04:30:34,0
visitation, and

147
04:30:34,0 --> 04:30:34,0
of

148
04:30:34,0 --> 04:30:34,0
judgment, and of

149
04:30:34,0 --> 04:30:34,0
indignation:

150
04:30:34,0 --> 04:30:34,0
The

151
04:30:34,0 --> 04:30:34,0
harvest is past,

152
04:30:34,0 --> 04:30:34,0
the summer

153
04:30:34,0 --> 04:30:34,0
is ended,

154
04:30:34,0 --> 04:36:39,
and my soul is not saved!

155
04:36:39,0 --> 04:36:39,0
17 Wo unto

156
04:36:39,0 --> 04:36:39,0
you poor

157
04:36:39,0 --> 04:36:39,0
men, whose

158
04:36:39,0 --> 04:36:39,0
hearts

159
04:36:39,0 --> 04:36:39,0
are not

160
04:36:39,0 --> 04:36:39,0
broken, whose

161
04:36:39,0 --> 04:36:39,0
spirits

162
04:36:39,0 --> 04:36:39,0
are not

163
04:36:39,0 --> 04:36:39,0
contrite, and

164
04:36:39,0 --> 04:36:39,0
whose

165
04:36:39,0 --> 04:36:39,0
bellies are

166
04:36:39,0 --> 04:36:39,0
not

167
04:36:39,0 --> 04:36:39,0
satisfied, and

168
04:36:39,0 --> 04:36:39,0
whose hands

169
04:36:39,0 --> 04:36:39,0
are not

170
04:36:39,0 --> 04:36:39,0
stayed from

171
04:36:39,0 --> 04:36:39,0
laying hold

172
04:36:39,0 --> 04:36:39,0
upon

173
04:36:39,0 --> 04:36:39,0
other men’s

174
04:36:39,0 --> 04:36:39,0
goods, whose

175
04:36:39,0 --> 04:36:39,0
eyes are

176
04:36:39,0 --> 04:36:39,0
full of

177
04:36:39,0 --> 04:36:39,0
greediness,

178
04:36:39,0 --> 04:36:39,0
and who

179
04:36:39,0 --> 05:03:37,
will not labor with your own hands!

180
05:03:37,0 --> 05:03:37,0
18 But

181
05:03:37,0 --> 05:03:37,0
blessed are

182
05:03:37,0 --> 05:03:37,0
the poor

183
05:03:37,0 --> 05:03:37,0
who are

184
05:03:37,0 --> 05:03:37,0
pure in

185
05:03:37,0 --> 05:03:37,0
heart,

186
05:03:37,0 --> 05:03:37,0
whose hearts

187
05:03:37,0 --> 05:03:37,0
are

188
05:03:37,0 --> 05:03:37,0
broken, and

189
05:03:37,0 --> 05:03:37,0
whose

190
05:03:37,0 --> 05:03:37,0
spirits are

191
05:03:37,0 --> 05:03:37,0
contrite,

192
05:03:37,0 --> 05:03:37,0
for they

193
05:03:37,0 --> 05:03:37,0
shall see

194
05:03:37,0 --> 05:03:37,0
the

195
05:03:37,0 --> 05:03:37,0
kingdom of

196
05:03:37,0 --> 05:03:37,0
God coming

197
05:03:37,0 --> 05:03:37,0
in power

198
05:03:37,0 --> 05:03:37,0
and great

199
05:03:37,0 --> 05:03:37,0
glory

200
05:03:37,0 --> 05:03:37,0
unto their

201
05:03:37,0 --> 05:03:37,0


202
05:03:37,0 --> 05:03:37,0
deliverance; for

203
05:03:37,0 --> 05:03:37,0
the

204
05:03:37,0 --> 04:59:17,
fatness of the earth shall be theirs.

205
04:59:17,0 --> 04:59:17,0
19 For

206
04:59:17,0 --> 04:59:17,0
behold,

207
04:59:17,0 --> 04:59:17,0
the Lord

208
04:59:17,0 --> 04:59:17,0
shall

209
04:59:17,0 --> 04:59:17,0
come, and

210
04:59:17,0 --> 04:59:17,0
his

211
04:59:17,0 --> 04:59:17,0
recompense

212
04:59:17,0 --> 04:59:17,0
shall be

213
04:59:17,0 --> 04:59:17,0
with

214
04:59:17,0 --> 04:59:17,0
him, and he

215
04:59:17,0 --> 04:59:17,0
shall

216
04:59:17,0 --> 04:59:17,0
reward

217
04:59:17,0 --> 04:59:17,0
every man,

218
04:59:17,0 --> 04:59:17,0
and the

219
04:59:17,0 --> 05:00:21,
poor shall rejoice;

220
05:00:21,0 --> 05:00:21,0
20 And

221
05:00:21,0 --> 05:00:21,0
their

222
05:00:21,0 --> 05:00:21,0


223
05:00:21,0 --> 05:00:21,0
generations

224
05:00:21,0 --> 05:00:21,0
shall

225
05:00:21,0 --> 05:00:21,0
inherit the

226
05:00:21,0 --> 05:00:21,0
earth

227
05:00:21,0 --> 05:00:21,0
from

228
05:00:21,0 --> 05:00:21,0


229
05:00:21,0 --> 05:00:21,0
generation to

230
05:00:21,0 --> 05:00:21,0


231
05:00:21,0 --> 05:00:21,0
generation,

232
05:00:21,0 --> 05:00:21,0
forever and

233
05:00:21,0 --> 05:00:21,0
ever.

234
05:00:21,0 --> 05:00:21,0
And now

235
05:00:21,0 --> 05:00:21,0
I make

236
05:00:21,0 --> 05:00:21,0
an end

237
05:00:21,0 --> 05:00:21,0
of

238
05:00:21,0 --> 05:00:21,0
speaking

239
05:00:21,0 --> 05:04:28,
unto you. Even so. Amen.
