00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:02,412
Section 56 Revelation given through Joseph

2
00:00:02,412 --> 00:00:04,824
Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, June 15,

3
00:00:04,824 --> 00:00:07,236
1831. This revelation chastises Ezra Thayre for not

4
00:00:07,236 --> 00:00:09,648
obeying a former revelation (the “commandment”

5
00:00:09,648 --> 00:00:12,06
referred to in 
verse 8), which Joseph Smith

6
00:00:12,06 --> 00:00:14,472
had received for him, instructing Thayre

7
00:00:14,472 --> 00:00:16,884
concerning his duties on Frederick G. Williams’ farm,

8
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:19,296
where he lived. The following revelation also

9
00:00:19,296 --> 00:00:21,708
revokes Thayre’s call to travel to Missouri with

10
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:24,12
Thomas B. Marsh (see 
section 52:22). 
1–2,

11
00:00:24,12 --> 00:00:26,532
The Saints must take up their cross and follow

12
00:00:26,532 --> 00:00:28,944
the Lord to gain salvation; 
3–13, The Lord

13
00:00:28,944 --> 00:00:31,356
commands and revokes, and the disobedient are cast

14
00:00:31,356 --> 00:00:33,768
off; 
14–17, Wo unto the rich who will not help

15
00:00:33,768 --> 00:00:36,18
the poor, and wo unto the poor whose hearts are

16
00:00:36,18 --> 00:00:38,592
not broken; 
18–20, Blessed are the poor who

17
00:00:38,592 --> 00:00:41,008
are pure in heart, for they will inherit the earth. 

18
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:58,208
1 Hearken, O ye people who profess my name,

19
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:15,408
saith the Lord your God; for behold, mine anger

20
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:32,608
is kindled against the rebellious, and they

21
00:01:32,608 --> 00:01:49,808
shall know mine arm and mine indignation, in the

22
00:01:49,808 --> 00:02:07,978
day of visitation and of wrath upon the nations.

23
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:08,645
2 And he that will not take up his

24
00:02:08,645 --> 00:02:09,312
cross and follow me, and keep my

25
00:02:09,312 --> 00:02:09,046
commandments, the same shall not be saved.

26
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:14,446
3 Behold, I, the Lord,

27
00:02:14,446 --> 00:02:19,846
command; and he that will not obey

28
00:02:19,846 --> 00:02:25,246
shall be cut off in mine own due

29
00:02:25,246 --> 00:02:30,646
time, after I have commanded

30
00:02:30,646 --> 00:02:36,056
and the commandment is broken.

31
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:36,656
4 Wherefore I, the Lord,

32
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:37,256
command and revoke, as it seemeth

33
00:02:37,256 --> 00:02:37,856
me good; and all this to be

34
00:02:37,856 --> 00:02:38,456
answered upon the heads of

35
00:02:38,456 --> 00:02:39,092
the rebellious, saith the Lord.

36
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:40,492
5 Wherefore, I revoke the

37
00:02:40,492 --> 00:02:41,892
commandment which was given

38
00:02:41,892 --> 00:02:43,292
unto my servants Thomas B.

39
00:02:43,292 --> 00:02:44,692
Marsh and Ezra Thayre, and

40
00:02:44,692 --> 00:02:46,092
give a new commandment unto

41
00:02:46,092 --> 00:02:47,492
my servant Thomas, that he

42
00:02:47,492 --> 00:02:48,892
shall take up his journey

43
00:02:48,892 --> 00:02:50,292
speedily to the land of

44
00:02:50,292 --> 00:02:51,692
Missouri, and my servant

45
00:02:51,692 --> 00:02:53,173
Selah J. Griffin shall also go with him.

46
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:53,298
6 For behold, I revoke

47
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:53,423
the commandment which was

48
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:53,548
given unto my servants

49
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:53,673
Selah J. Griffin and Newel

50
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:53,798
Knight, in consequence of

51
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:53,923
the stiffneckedness of my

52
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:54,048
people which are in

53
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:54,241
Thompson, and their rebellions.

54
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:55,812
7 Wherefore, let my

55
00:02:55,812 --> 00:02:57,383
servant Newel Knight remain

56
00:02:57,383 --> 00:02:58,954
with them; and as many

57
00:02:58,954 --> 00:03:00,525
as will go may go, that

58
00:03:00,525 --> 00:03:02,096
are contrite before me,

59
00:03:02,096 --> 00:03:03,667
and be led by him to the

60
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:05,252
land which I have appointed.

61
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:06,03
8 And again, verily I

62
00:03:06,03 --> 00:03:06,808
say unto you, that my

63
00:03:06,808 --> 00:03:07,586
servant Ezra Thayre must

64
00:03:07,586 --> 00:03:08,364
repent of his pride,

65
00:03:08,364 --> 00:03:09,142
and of his selfishness,

66
00:03:09,142 --> 00:03:09,92
and obey the former

67
00:03:09,92 --> 00:03:10,698
commandment which I have

68
00:03:10,698 --> 00:03:11,476
given him concerning the

69
00:03:11,476 --> 00:03:12,292
place upon which he lives.

70
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:11,459
9 And if he will do

71
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:10,626
this, as there shall be

72
00:03:10,626 --> 00:03:09,793
no divisions made upon

73
00:03:09,793 --> 00:03:08,96
the land, he shall be

74
00:03:08,96 --> 00:03:08,127
appointed still to go

75
00:03:08,127 --> 00:03:07,954
to the land of Missouri;

76
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:08,811
10 Otherwise he shall

77
00:03:08,811 --> 00:03:09,668
receive the money

78
00:03:09,668 --> 00:03:10,525
which he has paid, and

79
00:03:10,525 --> 00:03:11,382
shall leave the

80
00:03:11,382 --> 00:03:12,239
place, and shall be cut

81
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,096
off out of my church,

82
00:03:13,096 --> 00:03:13,043
saith the Lord God of hosts;

83
00:03:13,043 --> 00:03:16,876
11 And though the

84
00:03:16,876 --> 00:03:20,709
heaven and the

85
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:24,542
earth pass away,

86
00:03:24,542 --> 00:03:28,375
these words shall

87
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:32,208
not pass away,

88
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:36,066
but shall be fulfilled.

89
00:03:36,066 --> 00:03:38,566
12 And if my

90
00:03:38,566 --> 00:03:41,066
servant Joseph

91
00:03:41,066 --> 00:03:43,566
Smith, Jun., must

92
00:03:43,566 --> 00:03:46,066
needs pay the

93
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:48,566
money, behold, I,

94
00:03:48,566 --> 00:03:51,066
the Lord, will pay

95
00:03:51,066 --> 00:03:53,566
it unto him

96
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,066
again in the land

97
00:03:56,066 --> 00:03:58,566
of Missouri, that

98
00:03:58,566 --> 00:04:01,066
those of whom

99
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:03,566
he shall receive

100
00:04:03,566 --> 00:04:06,066
may be rewarded

101
00:04:06,066 --> 00:04:08,566
again according

102
00:04:08,566 --> 00:04:11,051
to that which they do;

103
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:15,384
13 For

104
00:04:15,384 --> 00:04:19,717
according to that which

105
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:24,05
they do they

106
00:04:24,05 --> 00:04:28,383
shall receive,

107
00:04:28,383 --> 00:04:32,716
even in lands

108
00:04:32,716 --> 00:04:37,093
for their inheritance.

109
00:04:37,093 --> 00:04:38,593
14 Behold,

110
00:04:38,593 --> 00:04:40,093
thus saith the

111
00:04:40,093 --> 00:04:41,593
Lord unto my

112
00:04:41,593 --> 00:04:43,093
people—you have

113
00:04:43,093 --> 00:04:44,593
many things to

114
00:04:44,593 --> 00:04:46,093
do and to

115
00:04:46,093 --> 00:04:47,593
repent of; for

116
00:04:47,593 --> 00:04:49,093
behold, your sins

117
00:04:49,093 --> 00:04:50,593
have come up

118
00:04:50,593 --> 00:04:52,093
unto me, and

119
00:04:52,093 --> 00:04:53,593
are not

120
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:55,093
pardoned, because you

121
00:04:55,093 --> 00:04:56,593
seek to

122
00:04:56,593 --> 00:04:58,165
counsel in your own ways.

123
00:04:58,165 --> 00:04:59,04
15 And your

124
00:04:59,04 --> 00:04:59,915
hearts are

125
00:04:59,915 --> 00:05:00,79
not

126
00:05:00,79 --> 00:05:01,665
satisfied. And ye

127
00:05:01,665 --> 00:05:02,54
obey not the

128
00:05:02,54 --> 00:05:03,415
truth, but

129
00:05:03,415 --> 00:05:04,29
have pleasure

130
00:05:04,29 --> 00:05:05,222
in unrighteousness.

131
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:06,264
16 Wo unto

132
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,306
you rich

133
00:05:07,306 --> 00:05:08,348
men, that

134
00:05:08,348 --> 00:05:09,39
will not give

135
00:05:09,39 --> 00:05:10,432
your

136
00:05:10,432 --> 00:05:11,474
substance to the

137
00:05:11,474 --> 00:05:12,516
poor, for

138
00:05:12,516 --> 00:05:13,558
your riches

139
00:05:13,558 --> 00:05:14,6
will canker

140
00:05:14,6 --> 00:05:15,642
your

141
00:05:15,642 --> 00:05:16,684
souls; and this

142
00:05:16,684 --> 00:05:17,726
shall be

143
00:05:17,726 --> 00:05:18,768
your

144
00:05:18,768 --> 00:05:19,81
lamentation in the

145
00:05:19,81 --> 00:05:20,852
day of

146
00:05:20,852 --> 00:05:21,894
visitation, and

147
00:05:21,894 --> 00:05:22,936
of

148
00:05:22,936 --> 00:05:23,978
judgment, and of

149
00:05:23,978 --> 00:05:25,02
indignation:

150
00:05:25,02 --> 00:05:26,062
The

151
00:05:26,062 --> 00:05:27,104
harvest is past,

152
00:05:27,104 --> 00:05:28,146
the summer

153
00:05:28,146 --> 00:05:29,188
is ended,

154
00:05:29,188 --> 00:05:30,263
and my soul is not saved!

155
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:30,543
17 Wo unto

156
00:05:30,543 --> 00:05:30,823
you poor

157
00:05:30,823 --> 00:05:31,103
men, whose

158
00:05:31,103 --> 00:05:31,383
hearts

159
00:05:31,383 --> 00:05:31,663
are not

160
00:05:31,663 --> 00:05:31,943
broken, whose

161
00:05:31,943 --> 00:05:32,223
spirits

162
00:05:32,223 --> 00:05:32,503
are not

163
00:05:32,503 --> 00:05:32,783
contrite, and

164
00:05:32,783 --> 00:05:33,063
whose

165
00:05:33,063 --> 00:05:33,343
bellies are

166
00:05:33,343 --> 00:05:33,623
not

167
00:05:33,623 --> 00:05:33,903
satisfied, and

168
00:05:33,903 --> 00:05:34,183
whose hands

169
00:05:34,183 --> 00:05:34,463
are not

170
00:05:34,463 --> 00:05:34,743
stayed from

171
00:05:34,743 --> 00:05:35,023
laying hold

172
00:05:35,023 --> 00:05:35,303
upon

173
00:05:35,303 --> 00:05:35,583
other men’s

174
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:35,863
goods, whose

175
00:05:35,863 --> 00:05:36,143
eyes are

176
00:05:36,143 --> 00:05:36,423
full of

177
00:05:36,423 --> 00:05:36,703
greediness,

178
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:36,983
and who

179
00:05:36,983 --> 00:05:37,32
will not labor with your own hands!

180
00:05:37,32 --> 00:05:37,6
18 But

181
00:05:37,6 --> 00:05:37,88
blessed are

182
00:05:37,88 --> 00:05:38,16
the poor

183
00:05:38,16 --> 00:05:38,44
who are

184
00:05:38,44 --> 00:05:38,72
pure in

185
00:05:38,72 --> 00:05:39,0
heart,

186
00:05:39,0 --> 00:05:39,28
whose hearts

187
00:05:39,28 --> 00:05:39,56
are

188
00:05:39,56 --> 00:05:39,84
broken, and

189
00:05:39,84 --> 00:05:40,12
whose

190
00:05:40,12 --> 00:05:40,4
spirits are

191
00:05:40,4 --> 00:05:40,68
contrite,

192
00:05:40,68 --> 00:05:40,96
for they

193
00:05:40,96 --> 00:05:41,24
shall see

194
00:05:41,24 --> 00:05:41,52
the

195
00:05:41,52 --> 00:05:41,8
kingdom of

196
00:05:41,8 --> 00:05:42,08
God coming

197
00:05:42,08 --> 00:05:42,36
in power

198
00:05:42,36 --> 00:05:42,64
and great

199
00:05:42,64 --> 00:05:42,92
glory

200
00:05:42,92 --> 00:05:43,2
unto their

201
00:05:43,2 --> 00:05:43,48


202
00:05:43,48 --> 00:05:43,76
deliverance; for

203
00:05:43,76 --> 00:05:44,04
the

204
00:05:44,04 --> 00:05:44,377
fatness of the earth shall be theirs.

205
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:44,444
19 For

206
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:44,511
behold,

207
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:44,578
the Lord

208
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:44,645
shall

209
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:44,712
come, and

210
00:05:44,712 --> 00:05:44,779
his

211
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:44,846
recompense

212
00:05:44,846 --> 00:05:44,913
shall be

213
00:05:44,913 --> 00:05:44,98
with

214
00:05:44,98 --> 00:05:45,047
him, and he

215
00:05:45,047 --> 00:05:45,114
shall

216
00:05:45,114 --> 00:05:45,181
reward

217
00:05:45,181 --> 00:05:45,248
every man,

218
00:05:45,248 --> 00:05:45,315
and the

219
00:05:45,315 --> 00:05:45,445
poor shall rejoice;

220
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:45,695
20 And

221
00:05:45,695 --> 00:05:45,945
their

222
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:46,195


223
00:05:46,195 --> 00:05:46,445
generations

224
00:05:46,445 --> 00:05:46,695
shall

225
00:05:46,695 --> 00:05:46,945
inherit the

226
00:05:46,945 --> 00:05:47,195
earth

227
00:05:47,195 --> 00:05:47,445
from

228
00:05:47,445 --> 00:05:47,695


229
00:05:47,695 --> 00:05:47,945
generation to

230
00:05:47,945 --> 00:05:48,195


231
00:05:48,195 --> 00:05:48,445
generation,

232
00:05:48,445 --> 00:05:48,695
forever and

233
00:05:48,695 --> 00:05:48,945
ever.

234
00:05:48,945 --> 00:05:49,195
And now

235
00:05:49,195 --> 00:05:49,445
I make

236
00:05:49,445 --> 00:05:49,695
an end

237
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:49,945
of

238
00:05:49,945 --> 00:05:50,195
speaking

239
00:05:50,195 --> 00:05:50,066
unto you. Even so. Amen.
