1
00:00:11,328 --> 00:00:17,884
Section 64 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:24,44
 the Prophet to the elders of the Church, at

3
00:00:24,44 --> 00:00:30,996
 Kirtland, Ohio, September 11, 1831. The Prophet was

4
00:00:30,996 --> 00:00:37,552
 preparing to move to Hiram, Ohio, to renew his work on

5
00:00:37,552 --> 00:00:44,108
 the translation of the Bible, which had been laid

6
00:00:44,108 --> 00:00:50,664
 aside while he had been in Missouri. A company of

7
00:00:50,664 --> 00:00:57,22
 brethren who had been commanded to journey to Zion

8
00:00:57,22 --> 00:01:03,776
 (Missouri) was earnestly engaged in making

9
00:01:03,776 --> 00:01:10,332
 preparations to leave in October. At this busy time, the

10
00:01:10,332 --> 00:01:16,888
 revelation was received. 
1–11, The Saints are

11
00:01:16,888 --> 00:01:23,444
 commanded to forgive one another, lest there remain

12
00:01:23,444 --> 00:01:29,0
 in them the greater sin; 
12–22, The unrepentant

13
00:01:29,0 --> 00:01:36,556
 are to be brought before the Church; 
23–25, He

14
00:01:36,556 --> 00:01:43,112
 that is tithed will not be burned at the Lord’s

15
00:01:43,112 --> 00:01:49,668
 coming; 
26–32, The Saints are warned against debt;

16
00:01:49,668 --> 00:01:56,224
33–36, The rebellious will be cut off out of Zion;

17
00:01:56,224 --> 00:02:02,78
37–40, The Church will judge the nations; 
41–43,

18
00:02:02,78 --> 00:02:09,336
 Zion will flourish.

19
00:02:09,946 --> 00:02:14,613
1 Behold, thus saith the Lord your God unto you, O

20
00:02:14,613 --> 00:02:19,28
 ye elders of my church, hearken ye and hear, and

21
00:02:19,28 --> 00:02:23,947
 receive my will concerning you

22
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:27,611
2 For verily I say unto you, I will that ye should

23
00:02:27,611 --> 00:02:31,278
 overcome the world; wherefore I will have

24
00:02:31,278 --> 00:02:34,945
 compassion upon you

25
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:40,705
3 There are those among you who have sinned; but

26
00:02:40,705 --> 00:02:46,455
 verily I say, for this once, for mine own glory,

27
00:02:46,455 --> 00:02:52,205
 and for the salvation of souls, I have forgiven you

28
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:57,955
 your sins

29
00:02:57,461 --> 00:03:01,961
4 I will be merciful unto you, for I have given

30
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:06,461
 unto you the kingdom

31
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:13,003
5 And the keys of the mysteries of the kingdom

32
00:03:13,003 --> 00:03:19,753
 shall not be taken from my servant Joseph Smith,

33
00:03:19,753 --> 00:03:26,503
 Jun., through the means I have appointed, while he

34
00:03:26,503 --> 00:03:33,253
 liveth, inasmuch as he obeyeth mine ordinances

35
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:38,013
6 There are those who have sought occasion against

36
00:03:38,013 --> 00:03:42,513
 him without cause

37
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:48,289
7 Nevertheless, he has sinned; but verily I say

38
00:03:48,289 --> 00:03:54,039
 unto you, I, the Lord, forgive sins unto those who

39
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:59,789
 confess their sins before me and ask forgiveness,

40
00:03:59,789 --> 00:04:05,539
 who have not sinned unto death

41
00:04:05,796 --> 00:04:10,796
8 My disciples, in days of old, sought occasion

42
00:04:10,796 --> 00:04:15,796
 against one another and forgave not one another in

43
00:04:15,796 --> 00:04:20,796
 their hearts; and for this evil they were afflicted

44
00:04:20,796 --> 00:04:25,796
 and sorely chastened

45
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:31,298
9 Wherefore, I say unto you, that ye ought to

46
00:04:31,298 --> 00:04:37,298
 forgive one another; for he that forgiveth not his

47
00:04:37,298 --> 00:04:43,298
 brother his trespasses standeth condemned before the

48
00:04:43,298 --> 00:04:49,298
 Lord; for there remaineth in him the greater sin

49
00:04:49,306 --> 00:04:55,306
10 I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive,

50
00:04:55,306 --> 00:05:01,306
 but of you it is required to forgive all men

51
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:06,601
11 And ye ought to say in your hearts—let God

52
00:05:06,601 --> 00:05:11,601
 judge between me and thee, and reward thee according

53
00:05:11,601 --> 00:05:16,601
 to thy deeds

54
00:05:16,6 --> 00:05:21,35
12 And him that repenteth not of his sins, and

55
00:05:21,35 --> 00:05:26,1
 confesseth them not, ye shall bring before the

56
00:05:26,1 --> 00:05:30,85
 church, and do with him as the scripture saith unto you,

57
00:05:30,85 --> 00:05:35,6
 either by commandment or by revelation

58
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:42,469
13 And this ye shall do that God may be

59
00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:49,069
 glorified—not because ye forgive not, having not compassion,

60
00:05:49,069 --> 00:05:55,669
 but that ye may be justified in the eyes of the

61
00:05:55,669 --> 00:06:02,269
 law, that ye may not offend him who is your

62
00:06:02,269 --> 00:06:08,869
 lawgiver

63
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:13,635
14 Verily I say, for this cause ye shall do these

64
00:06:13,635 --> 00:06:18,635
 things

65
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:23,161
15 Behold, I, the Lord, was angry with him who was

66
00:06:23,161 --> 00:06:27,911
 my servant Ezra Booth, and also my servant Isaac

67
00:06:27,911 --> 00:06:32,661
 Morley, for they kept not the law, neither the

68
00:06:32,661 --> 00:06:37,411
 commandment

69
00:06:37,414 --> 00:06:41,914
16 They sought evil in their hearts, and I, the

70
00:06:41,914 --> 00:06:46,414
 Lord, withheld my Spirit. They condemned for evil

71
00:06:46,414 --> 00:06:50,914
 that thing in which there was no evil; nevertheless

72
00:06:50,914 --> 00:06:55,414
 I have forgiven my servant Isaac Morley

73
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:58,099
17 And also my servant Edward Partridge, behold,

74
00:06:58,099 --> 00:07:00,499
 he hath sinned, and Satan seeketh to destroy his

75
00:07:00,499 --> 00:07:02,899
 soul; but when these things are made known unto

76
00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:05,299
 them, and they repent of the evil, they shall be

77
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,699
 forgiven

78
00:07:07,21 --> 00:07:14,96
18 And now, verily I say that it is expedient in

79
00:07:14,96 --> 00:07:22,71
 me that my servant Sidney Gilbert, after a few

80
00:07:22,71 --> 00:07:30,46
 weeks, shall return upon his business, and to his

81
00:07:30,46 --> 00:07:38,21
 agency in the land of Zion

82
00:07:38,942 --> 00:07:44,609
19 And that which he hath seen and heard may be

83
00:07:44,609 --> 00:07:50,276
 made known unto my disciples, that they perish not.

84
00:07:50,276 --> 00:07:55,943
 And for this cause have I spoken these things

85
00:07:55,241 --> 00:08:00,441
20 And again, I say unto you, that my servant

86
00:08:00,441 --> 00:08:05,641
 Isaac Morley may not be tempted above that which he is

87
00:08:05,641 --> 00:08:10,841
 able to bear, and counsel wrongfully to your

88
00:08:10,841 --> 00:08:16,041
 hurt, I gave commandment that his farm should be sold

89
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:21,241


90
00:08:21,017 --> 00:08:26,617
21 I will not that my servant Frederick G.

91
00:08:26,617 --> 00:08:32,217
 Williams should sell his farm, for I, the Lord, will to

92
00:08:32,217 --> 00:08:37,817
 retain a strong hold in the land of Kirtland, for

93
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:43,417
 the space of five years, in the which I will not

94
00:08:43,417 --> 00:08:49,017
 overthrow the wicked, that thereby I may save some

95
00:08:49,546 --> 00:08:55,796
22 And after that day, I, the Lord, will not hold

96
00:08:55,796 --> 00:09:02,046
 any guilty that shall go with an open heart up to

97
00:09:02,046 --> 00:09:08,296
 the land of Zion; for I, the Lord, require the

98
00:09:08,296 --> 00:09:14,546
 hearts of the children of men

99
00:09:14,07 --> 00:09:19,47
23 Behold, now it is called today until the coming

100
00:09:19,47 --> 00:09:24,87
 of the Son of Man, and verily it is a day of

101
00:09:24,87 --> 00:09:30,27
 sacrifice, and a day for the tithing of my people; for

102
00:09:30,27 --> 00:09:35,67
 he that is tithed shall not be burned at his

103
00:09:35,67 --> 00:09:41,07
 coming

104
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:48,648
24 For after today cometh the burning—this is

105
00:09:48,648 --> 00:09:55,481
 speaking after the manner of the Lord—for verily I

106
00:09:55,481 --> 00:10:02,314
 say, tomorrow all the proud and they that do wickedly

107
00:10:02,314 --> 00:10:09,147
 shall be as stubble; and I will burn them up, for

108
00:10:09,147 --> 00:10:15,98
 I am the Lord of Hosts; and I will not spare any

109
00:10:15,98 --> 00:10:22,813
 that remain in Babylon

110
00:10:22,572 --> 00:10:29,572
25 Wherefore, if ye believe me, ye will labor

111
00:10:29,572 --> 00:10:36,572
 while it is called today

112
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:41,069
26 And it is not meet that my servants, Newel K.

113
00:10:41,069 --> 00:10:45,569
 Whitney and Sidney Gilbert, should sell their store

114
00:10:45,569 --> 00:10:50,069
 and their possessions here; for this is not

115
00:10:50,069 --> 00:10:54,569
 wisdom until the residue of the church, which remaineth

116
00:10:54,569 --> 00:10:59,069
 in this place, shall go up unto the land of Zion

117
00:10:59,069 --> 00:11:03,569


118
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:07,329
27 Behold, it is said in my laws, or forbidden, to

119
00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:11,329
 get in debt to thine enemies

120
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:15,971
28 But behold, it is not said at any time that the

121
00:11:15,971 --> 00:11:20,304
 Lord should not take when he please, and pay as

122
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:24,637
 seemeth him good

123
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:29,75
29 Wherefore, as ye are agents, ye are on the

124
00:11:29,75 --> 00:11:35,083
 Lord’s errand; and whatever ye do according to the

125
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:40,416
 will of the Lord is the Lord’s business

126
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:45,166
30 And he hath set you to provide for his saints

127
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:50,166
 in these last days, that they may obtain an

128
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:55,166
 inheritance in the land of Zion

129
00:11:55,431 --> 00:12:00,098
31 And behold, I, the Lord, declare unto you, and

130
00:12:00,098 --> 00:12:04,765
 my words are sure and shall not fail, that they

131
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:09,432
 shall obtain it

132
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:12,929
32 But all things must come to pass in their time

133
00:12:12,929 --> 00:12:16,429


134
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:22,869
33 Wherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye

135
00:12:22,869 --> 00:12:29,536
 are laying the foundation of a great work. And out

136
00:12:29,536 --> 00:12:36,203
 of small things proceedeth that which is great

137
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:43,39
34 Behold, the Lord requireth the heart and a

138
00:12:43,39 --> 00:12:50,057
 willing mind; and the willing and obedient shall eat

139
00:12:50,057 --> 00:12:56,724
 the good of the land of Zion in these last days

140
00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:01,376
35 And the rebellious shall be cut off out of the

141
00:13:01,376 --> 00:13:06,043
 land of Zion, and shall be sent away, and shall

142
00:13:06,043 --> 00:13:10,71
 not inherit the land

143
00:13:10,473 --> 00:13:16,14
36 For, verily I say that the rebellious are not

144
00:13:16,14 --> 00:13:21,807
 of the blood of Ephraim, wherefore they shall be

145
00:13:21,807 --> 00:13:27,474
 plucked out

146
00:13:27,757 --> 00:13:33,09
37 Behold, I, the Lord, have made my church in

147
00:13:33,09 --> 00:13:38,423
 these last days like unto a judge sitting on a hill,

148
00:13:38,423 --> 00:13:43,756
 or in a high place, to judge the nations

149
00:13:43,74 --> 00:13:47,073
38 For it shall come to pass that the inhabitants

150
00:13:47,073 --> 00:13:50,406
 of Zion shall judge all things pertaining to Zion

151
00:13:50,406 --> 00:13:53,739


152
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:57,699
39 And liars and hypocrites shall be proved by

153
00:13:57,699 --> 00:14:02,366
 them, and they who are not apostles and prophets

154
00:14:02,366 --> 00:14:07,033
 shall be known

155
00:14:07,03 --> 00:14:11,03
40 And even the bishop, who is a judge, and his

156
00:14:11,03 --> 00:14:15,03
 counselors, if they are not faithful in their

157
00:14:15,03 --> 00:14:19,03
 stewardships shall be condemned, and others shall be

158
00:14:19,03 --> 00:14:23,03
 planted in their stead

159
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:27,563
41 For, behold, I say unto you that Zion shall

160
00:14:27,563 --> 00:14:31,563
 flourish, and the glory of the Lord shall be upon

161
00:14:31,563 --> 00:14:35,563
 her

162
00:14:35,324 --> 00:14:39,324
42 And she shall be an ensign unto the people, and

163
00:14:39,324 --> 00:14:43,324
 there shall come unto her out of every nation

164
00:14:43,324 --> 00:14:47,324
 under heaven

165
00:14:47,32 --> 00:14:52,32
43 And the day shall come when the nations of the

166
00:14:52,32 --> 00:14:57,32
 earth shall tremble because of her, and shall fear

167
00:14:57,32 --> 00:15:02,32
 because of her terrible ones. The Lord hath

168
00:15:02,32 --> 00:15:07,32
 spoken it. Amen.
