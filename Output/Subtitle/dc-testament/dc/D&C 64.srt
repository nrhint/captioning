00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 64 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Prophet to the elders of the Church, at

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Kirtland, Ohio, September 11, 1831. The Prophet was

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
preparing to move to Hiram, Ohio, to renew his

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
work on the translation of the Bible, which had

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
been laid aside while he had been in Missouri. A

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
company of brethren who had been commanded to

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
journey to Zion (Missouri) was earnestly engaged

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
in making preparations to leave in October. At

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
this busy time, the revelation was received.

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
1–11, The Saints are commanded to forgive one

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
another, lest there remain in them the greater sin;

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
12–22, The unrepentant are to be brought before

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Church; 
23–25, He that is tithed will not

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
be burned at the Lord’s coming; 
26–32, The

16
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Saints are warned against debt; 
33–36, The

17
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
rebellious will be cut off out of Zion; 
37–40, The

18
00:00:00,0 --> 02:08:48,
Church will judge the nations; 
41–43, Zion will flourish. 

19
02:08:48,0 --> 02:08:48,0
1 Behold, thus saith the Lord your God unto

20
02:08:48,0 --> 02:08:48,0
you, O ye elders of my church, hearken ye

21
02:08:48,0 --> 02:14:53,
and hear, and receive my will concerning you.

22
02:14:53,0 --> 02:14:53,0
2 For verily I say unto you, I will

23
02:14:53,0 --> 02:14:53,0
that ye should overcome the world;

24
02:14:53,0 --> 02:21:55,
wherefore I will have compassion upon you.

25
02:21:55,0 --> 02:21:55,0
3 There are those among you who

26
02:21:55,0 --> 02:21:55,0
have sinned; but verily I say,

27
02:21:55,0 --> 02:21:55,0
for this once, for mine own

28
02:21:55,0 --> 02:21:55,0
glory, and for the salvation of

29
02:21:55,0 --> 02:22:59,
souls, I have forgiven you your sins.

30
02:22:59,0 --> 02:22:59,0
4 I will be merciful

31
02:22:59,0 --> 02:22:59,0
unto you, for I have

32
02:22:59,0 --> 02:34:37,
given unto you the kingdom.

33
02:34:37,0 --> 02:34:37,0
5 And the keys of the

34
02:34:37,0 --> 02:34:37,0
mysteries of the

35
02:34:37,0 --> 02:34:37,0
kingdom shall not be

36
02:34:37,0 --> 02:34:37,0
taken from my servant

37
02:34:37,0 --> 02:34:37,0
Joseph Smith, Jun.,

38
02:34:37,0 --> 02:34:37,0
through the means I have

39
02:34:37,0 --> 02:34:37,0
appointed, while he

40
02:34:37,0 --> 02:34:37,0
liveth, inasmuch as

41
02:34:37,0 --> 02:56:40,
he obeyeth mine ordinances.

42
02:56:40,0 --> 02:56:40,0
6 There are those

43
02:56:40,0 --> 02:56:40,0
who have sought

44
02:56:40,0 --> 02:56:40,0
occasion against

45
02:56:40,0 --> 03:03:43,
him without cause;

46
03:03:43,0 --> 03:03:43,0
7 Nevertheless,

47
03:03:43,0 --> 03:03:43,0
he has sinned;

48
03:03:43,0 --> 03:03:43,0
but verily I say

49
03:03:43,0 --> 03:03:43,0
unto you, I, the

50
03:03:43,0 --> 03:03:43,0
Lord, forgive

51
03:03:43,0 --> 03:03:43,0
sins unto those

52
03:03:43,0 --> 03:03:43,0
who confess their

53
03:03:43,0 --> 03:03:43,0
sins before me

54
03:03:43,0 --> 03:03:43,0
and ask

55
03:03:43,0 --> 03:03:43,0
forgiveness, who have

56
03:03:43,0 --> 03:04:47,
not sinned unto death.

57
03:04:47,0 --> 03:04:47,0
8 My disciples,

58
03:04:47,0 --> 03:04:47,0
in days of

59
03:04:47,0 --> 03:04:47,0
old, sought

60
03:04:47,0 --> 03:04:47,0
occasion against one

61
03:04:47,0 --> 03:04:47,0
another and

62
03:04:47,0 --> 03:04:47,0
forgave not one

63
03:04:47,0 --> 03:04:47,0
another in their

64
03:04:47,0 --> 03:04:47,0
hearts; and for

65
03:04:47,0 --> 03:04:47,0
this evil they

66
03:04:47,0 --> 03:04:47,0
were afflicted

67
03:04:47,0 --> 03:08:25,
and sorely chastened.

68
03:08:25,0 --> 03:08:25,0
9 Wherefore, I

69
03:08:25,0 --> 03:08:25,0
say unto you,

70
03:08:25,0 --> 03:08:25,0
that ye ought

71
03:08:25,0 --> 03:08:25,0
to forgive

72
03:08:25,0 --> 03:08:25,0
one another; for

73
03:08:25,0 --> 03:08:25,0
he that

74
03:08:25,0 --> 03:08:25,0
forgiveth not his

75
03:08:25,0 --> 03:08:25,0
brother his

76
03:08:25,0 --> 03:08:25,0
trespasses

77
03:08:25,0 --> 03:08:25,0
standeth condemned

78
03:08:25,0 --> 03:08:25,0
before the

79
03:08:25,0 --> 03:08:25,0
Lord; for there

80
03:08:25,0 --> 03:08:25,0
remaineth in him

81
03:08:25,0 --> 03:31:26,
the greater sin.

82
03:31:26,0 --> 03:31:26,0
10 I, the

83
03:31:26,0 --> 03:31:26,0
Lord, will

84
03:31:26,0 --> 03:31:26,0
forgive whom I

85
03:31:26,0 --> 03:31:26,0
will forgive,

86
03:31:26,0 --> 03:31:26,0
but of you it

87
03:31:26,0 --> 03:31:26,0
is required to

88
03:31:26,0 --> 03:27:06,
forgive all men.

89
03:27:06,0 --> 03:27:06,0
11 And ye

90
03:27:06,0 --> 03:27:06,0
ought to say

91
03:27:06,0 --> 03:27:06,0
in your

92
03:27:06,0 --> 03:27:06,0
hearts—let God

93
03:27:06,0 --> 03:27:06,0
judge between

94
03:27:06,0 --> 03:27:06,0
me and thee,

95
03:27:06,0 --> 03:27:06,0
and reward

96
03:27:06,0 --> 03:27:06,0
thee

97
03:27:06,0 --> 03:32:11,
according to thy deeds.

98
03:32:11,0 --> 03:32:11,0
12 And him

99
03:32:11,0 --> 03:32:11,0
that

100
03:32:11,0 --> 03:32:11,0
repenteth not of

101
03:32:11,0 --> 03:32:11,0
his sins,

102
03:32:11,0 --> 03:32:11,0
and

103
03:32:11,0 --> 03:32:11,0
confesseth them

104
03:32:11,0 --> 03:32:11,0
not, ye shall

105
03:32:11,0 --> 03:32:11,0
bring

106
03:32:11,0 --> 03:32:11,0
before the

107
03:32:11,0 --> 03:32:11,0
church, and do

108
03:32:11,0 --> 03:32:11,0
with him as

109
03:32:11,0 --> 03:32:11,0
the

110
03:32:11,0 --> 03:32:11,0
scripture saith

111
03:32:11,0 --> 03:32:11,0
unto you,

112
03:32:11,0 --> 03:32:11,0
either by

113
03:32:11,0 --> 03:41:14,
commandment or by revelation.

114
03:41:14,0 --> 03:41:14,0
13 And

115
03:41:14,0 --> 03:41:14,0
this ye shall

116
03:41:14,0 --> 03:41:14,0
do that

117
03:41:14,0 --> 03:41:14,0
God may be

118
03:41:14,0 --> 03:41:14,0


119
03:41:14,0 --> 03:41:14,0
glorified—not

120
03:41:14,0 --> 03:41:14,0
because ye

121
03:41:14,0 --> 03:41:14,0
forgive not,

122
03:41:14,0 --> 03:41:14,0
having not

123
03:41:14,0 --> 03:41:14,0
compassion,

124
03:41:14,0 --> 03:41:14,0
but that

125
03:41:14,0 --> 03:41:14,0
ye may be

126
03:41:14,0 --> 03:41:14,0
justified

127
03:41:14,0 --> 03:41:14,0
in the

128
03:41:14,0 --> 03:41:14,0
eyes of the

129
03:41:14,0 --> 03:41:14,0
law, that

130
03:41:14,0 --> 03:41:14,0
ye may not

131
03:41:14,0 --> 03:41:14,0
offend him

132
03:41:14,0 --> 04:04:15,
who is your lawgiver—

133
04:04:15,0 --> 04:04:15,0
14 Verily

134
04:04:15,0 --> 04:04:15,0
I say,

135
04:04:15,0 --> 04:04:15,0
for this

136
04:04:15,0 --> 04:04:15,0
cause ye

137
04:04:15,0 --> 04:04:15,0
shall do

138
04:04:15,0 --> 04:24:20,
these things.

139
04:24:20,0 --> 04:24:20,0
15

140
04:24:20,0 --> 04:24:20,0
Behold, I,

141
04:24:20,0 --> 04:24:20,0
the Lord,

142
04:24:20,0 --> 04:24:20,0
was

143
04:24:20,0 --> 04:24:20,0
angry with

144
04:24:20,0 --> 04:24:20,0
him who

145
04:24:20,0 --> 04:24:20,0
was my

146
04:24:20,0 --> 04:24:20,0
servant

147
04:24:20,0 --> 04:24:20,0
Ezra

148
04:24:20,0 --> 04:24:20,0
Booth, and

149
04:24:20,0 --> 04:24:20,0
also my

150
04:24:20,0 --> 04:24:20,0
servant

151
04:24:20,0 --> 04:24:20,0
Isaac

152
04:24:20,0 --> 04:24:20,0
Morley, for

153
04:24:20,0 --> 04:24:20,0
they

154
04:24:20,0 --> 04:24:20,0
kept not

155
04:24:20,0 --> 04:24:20,0
the law,

156
04:24:20,0 --> 04:35:20,
neither the commandment;

157
04:35:20,0 --> 04:35:20,0
16 They

158
04:35:20,0 --> 04:35:20,0
sought

159
04:35:20,0 --> 04:35:20,0
evil

160
04:35:20,0 --> 04:35:20,0
in their

161
04:35:20,0 --> 04:35:20,0


162
04:35:20,0 --> 04:35:20,0
hearts, and

163
04:35:20,0 --> 04:35:20,0
I, the

164
04:35:20,0 --> 04:35:20,0
Lord,

165
04:35:20,0 --> 04:35:20,0
withheld

166
04:35:20,0 --> 04:35:20,0
my

167
04:35:20,0 --> 04:35:20,0
Spirit.

168
04:35:20,0 --> 04:35:20,0
They

169
04:35:20,0 --> 04:35:20,0
condemned

170
04:35:20,0 --> 04:35:20,0
for evil

171
04:35:20,0 --> 04:35:20,0
that

172
04:35:20,0 --> 04:35:20,0
thing in

173
04:35:20,0 --> 04:35:20,0
which

174
04:35:20,0 --> 04:35:20,0
there

175
04:35:20,0 --> 04:35:20,0
was no

176
04:35:20,0 --> 04:35:20,0
evil;

177
04:35:20,0 --> 04:35:20,0


178
04:35:20,0 --> 04:35:20,0
nevertheless I

179
04:35:20,0 --> 04:35:20,0
have

180
04:35:20,0 --> 04:48:24,
forgiven my servant Isaac Morley.

181
04:48:24,0 --> 04:48:24,0
17 And

182
04:48:24,0 --> 04:48:24,0
also

183
04:48:24,0 --> 04:48:24,0
my

184
04:48:24,0 --> 04:48:24,0
servant

185
04:48:24,0 --> 04:48:24,0
Edward

186
04:48:24,0 --> 04:48:24,0


187
04:48:24,0 --> 04:48:24,0
Partridge,

188
04:48:24,0 --> 04:48:24,0
behold,

189
04:48:24,0 --> 04:48:24,0
he

190
04:48:24,0 --> 04:48:24,0
hath

191
04:48:24,0 --> 04:48:24,0
sinned,

192
04:48:24,0 --> 04:48:24,0
and

193
04:48:24,0 --> 04:48:24,0
Satan

194
04:48:24,0 --> 04:48:24,0
seeketh

195
04:48:24,0 --> 04:48:24,0
to

196
04:48:24,0 --> 04:48:24,0
destroy

197
04:48:24,0 --> 04:48:24,0
his

198
04:48:24,0 --> 04:48:24,0
soul; but

199
04:48:24,0 --> 04:48:24,0
when

200
04:48:24,0 --> 04:48:24,0
these

201
04:48:24,0 --> 04:48:24,0
things

202
04:48:24,0 --> 04:48:24,0
are

203
04:48:24,0 --> 04:48:24,0
made

204
04:48:24,0 --> 04:48:24,0
known

205
04:48:24,0 --> 04:48:24,0
unto

206
04:48:24,0 --> 04:48:24,0
them, and

207
04:48:24,0 --> 04:48:24,0
they

208
04:48:24,0 --> 04:48:24,0
repent

209
04:48:24,0 --> 04:48:24,0
of the

210
04:48:24,0 --> 04:57:27,
evil, they shall be forgiven.

211
04:57:27,0 --> 04:57:27,0
18

212
04:57:27,0 --> 04:57:27,0
And

213
04:57:27,0 --> 04:57:27,0
now,

214
04:57:27,0 --> 04:57:27,0
verily I

215
04:57:27,0 --> 04:57:27,0
say

216
04:57:27,0 --> 04:57:27,0
that

217
04:57:27,0 --> 04:57:27,0
it is

218
04:57:27,0 --> 04:57:27,0


219
04:57:27,0 --> 04:57:27,0
expedient

220
04:57:27,0 --> 04:57:27,0
in

221
04:57:27,0 --> 04:57:27,0
me

222
04:57:27,0 --> 04:57:27,0
that my

223
04:57:27,0 --> 04:57:27,0


224
04:57:27,0 --> 04:57:27,0
servant

225
04:57:27,0 --> 04:57:27,0
Sidney

226
