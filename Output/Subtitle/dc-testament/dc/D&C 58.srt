Section 58 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Prophet, in Zion, Jackson County, Missouri,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
August 1, 1831. Earlier, on the first Sabbath

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
after the arrival of the Prophet and his party in

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Jackson County, Missouri, a religious service had

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
been held, and two members had been received by

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
baptism. During that week, some of the Colesville

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Saints from the Thompson Branch and others arrived

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
(see 
section 54). Many were eager to learn the

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
will of the Lord concerning them in the new place

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of gathering. 
1–5, Those who endure tribulation

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
will be crowned with glory; 
6–12, The Saints are

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
to prepare for the marriage of the Lamb and the

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
supper of the Lord; 
13–18, Bishops are judges in

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Israel; 
19–23, The Saints are to obey the laws

16
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of the land; 
24–29, Men should use their agency

17
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
to do good; 
30–33, The Lord commands and

18
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
revokes; 
34–43, To repent, men must confess and forsake

19
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
their sins; 
44–58, The Saints are to purchase

20
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
their inheritance and gather in Missouri; 
59–65,

21
00:00:00,0 --> 02:36:46,
The gospel must be preached unto every creature. 

22
02:36:46,0 --> 02:36:46,0
1 Hearken, O ye elders of my church, and

23
02:36:46,0 --> 02:36:46,0
give ear to my word, and learn of me

24
02:36:46,0 --> 02:36:46,0
what I will concerning you, and also

25
02:36:46,0 --> 02:56:51,
concerning this land unto which I have sent you.

26
02:56:51,0 --> 02:56:51,0
2 For verily I say unto you,

27
02:56:51,0 --> 02:56:51,0
blessed is he that keepeth my

28
02:56:51,0 --> 02:56:51,0
commandments, whether in life or in

29
02:56:51,0 --> 02:56:51,0
death; and he that is faithful in

30
02:56:51,0 --> 02:56:51,0
tribulation, the reward of the same

31
02:56:51,0 --> 03:19:52,
is greater in the kingdom of heaven.

32
03:19:52,0 --> 03:19:52,0
3 Ye cannot behold with your

33
03:19:52,0 --> 03:19:52,0
natural eyes, for the present time,

34
03:19:52,0 --> 03:19:52,0
the design of your God

35
03:19:52,0 --> 03:19:52,0
concerning those things which shall come

36
03:19:52,0 --> 03:19:52,0
hereafter, and the glory which

37
03:19:52,0 --> 03:38:51,
shall follow after much tribulation.

38
03:38:51,0 --> 03:38:51,0
4 For after much tribulation

39
03:38:51,0 --> 03:38:51,0
come the blessings. Wherefore the

40
03:38:51,0 --> 03:38:51,0
day cometh that ye shall be

41
03:38:51,0 --> 03:38:51,0
crowned with much glory; the hour

42
03:38:51,0 --> 03:38:29,
is not yet, but is nigh at hand.

43
03:38:29,0 --> 03:38:29,0
5 Remember this, which I

44
03:38:29,0 --> 03:38:29,0
tell you before, that you may

45
03:38:29,0 --> 03:38:29,0
lay it to heart, and

46
03:38:29,0 --> 03:34:09,
receive that which is to follow.

47
03:34:09,0 --> 03:34:09,0
6 Behold, verily I say

48
03:34:09,0 --> 03:34:09,0
unto you, for this cause I

49
03:34:09,0 --> 03:34:09,0
have sent you—that you

50
03:34:09,0 --> 03:34:09,0
might be obedient, and that

51
03:34:09,0 --> 03:34:09,0
your hearts might be

52
03:34:09,0 --> 03:34:09,0
prepared to bear testimony

53
03:34:09,0 --> 03:39:14,
of the things which are to come;

54
03:39:14,0 --> 03:39:14,0
7 And also that you

55
03:39:14,0 --> 03:39:14,0
might be honored in

56
03:39:14,0 --> 03:39:14,0
laying the foundation, and

57
03:39:14,0 --> 03:39:14,0
in bearing record of

58
03:39:14,0 --> 03:39:14,0
the land upon which

59
03:39:14,0 --> 04:02:15,
the Zion of God shall stand;

60
04:02:15,0 --> 04:02:15,0
8 And also that a

61
04:02:15,0 --> 04:02:15,0
feast of fat things

62
04:02:15,0 --> 04:02:15,0
might be prepared for

63
04:02:15,0 --> 04:02:15,0
the poor; yea, a

64
04:02:15,0 --> 04:02:15,0
feast of fat things, of

65
04:02:15,0 --> 04:02:15,0
wine on the lees

66
04:02:15,0 --> 04:02:15,0
well refined, that the

67
04:02:15,0 --> 04:02:15,0
earth may know that

68
04:02:15,0 --> 04:02:15,0
the mouths of the

69
04:02:15,0 --> 04:20:47,
prophets shall not fail;

70
04:20:47,0 --> 04:20:47,0
9 Yea, a supper of

71
04:20:47,0 --> 04:20:47,0
the house of the

72
04:20:47,0 --> 04:20:47,0
Lord, well prepared,

73
04:20:47,0 --> 04:20:47,0
unto which all

74
04:20:47,0 --> 04:39:47,
nations shall be invited.

75
04:39:47,0 --> 04:39:47,0
10 First, the

76
04:39:47,0 --> 04:39:47,0
rich and the

77
04:39:47,0 --> 04:39:47,0
learned, the

78
04:39:47,0 --> 04:56:49,
wise and the noble;

79
04:56:49,0 --> 04:56:49,0
11 And after

80
04:56:49,0 --> 04:56:49,0
that cometh

81
04:56:49,0 --> 04:56:49,0
the day of my

82
04:56:49,0 --> 04:56:49,0
power; then

83
04:56:49,0 --> 04:56:49,0
shall the

84
04:56:49,0 --> 04:56:49,0

85
04:56:49,0 --> 04:56:49,0
and the blind,

86
04:56:49,0 --> 04:56:49,0
and the

87
04:56:49,0 --> 04:56:49,0
deaf, come in

88
04:56:49,0 --> 04:56:49,0

Lord, prepared

94
04:56:49,0 --> 05:24:53,

05:24:53,0 --> 05:24:53,0
12 Behold, I,

05:36:31,0 --> 05:36:31,0
13 And that

05:36:31,0 --> 05:36:31,0
the

100
05:36:31,0 --> 05:36:31,0

107
05:32:11,0 --> 05:32:11,0
14 Yea,

108
05:32:11,0 --> 05:32:11,0
for this

109
05:32:11,0 --> 05:32:11,0
cause I have

05:36:18,0 --> 05:36:18,0
he

123
05:36:18,0 --> 05:36:18,0
repent not of

124
05:36:18,0 --> 05:36:18,0
his sins,

125
05:36:18,0 --> 05:36:18,0
which

126
05:36:18,0 --> 05:36:18,0

127
05:36:18,0 --> 05:36:18,0
unbelief and

128
05:36:18,0 --> 05:36:18,0
blindness of

132
05:36:18,0 --> 05:46:21,
lest he fall.

133
