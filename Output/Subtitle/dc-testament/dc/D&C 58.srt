00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:18,23
Section 58 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:18,23 --> 00:00:25,182
 the Prophet, in Zion, Jackson County, Missouri,

3
00:00:25,182 --> 00:00:32,134
 August 1, 1831. Earlier, on the first Sabbath after

4
00:00:32,134 --> 00:00:39,086
 the arrival of the Prophet and his party in Jackson

5
00:00:39,086 --> 00:00:46,038
 County, Missouri, a religious service had been

6
00:00:46,038 --> 00:00:52,99
 held, and two members had been received by baptism.

7
00:00:52,99 --> 00:00:59,942
 During that week, some of the Colesville Saints

8
00:00:59,942 --> 00:01:06,894
 from the Thompson Branch and others arrived (see

9
00:01:06,894 --> 00:01:13,846
section 54). Many were eager to learn the will of

10
00:01:13,846 --> 00:01:20,798
 the Lord concerning them in the new place of

11
00:01:20,798 --> 00:01:27,75
 gathering. 
1–5, Those who endure tribulation will be

12
00:01:27,75 --> 00:01:34,702
 crowned with glory; 
6–12, The Saints are to prepare

13
00:01:34,702 --> 00:01:41,654
 for the marriage of the Lamb and the supper of the

14
00:01:41,654 --> 00:01:48,606
 Lord; 
13–18, Bishops are judges in Israel;

15
00:01:48,606 --> 00:01:55,558
19–23, The Saints are to obey the laws of the land;

16
00:01:55,558 --> 00:02:02,51
24–29, Men should use their agency to do good;

17
00:02:02,51 --> 00:02:09,462
30–33, The Lord commands and revokes; 
34–43, To

18
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:16,414
 repent, men must confess and forsake their sins;

19
00:02:16,414 --> 00:02:23,366
44–58, The Saints are to purchase their inheritance

20
00:02:23,366 --> 00:02:30,318
 and gather in Missouri; 
59–65, The gospel must be

21
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:37,27
 preached unto every creature.

22
00:02:37,607 --> 00:02:42,607
1 Hearken, O ye elders of my church, and give ear

23
00:02:42,607 --> 00:02:47,607
 to my word, and learn of me what I will concerning

24
00:02:47,607 --> 00:02:52,607
 you, and also concerning this land unto which I

25
00:02:52,607 --> 00:02:57,607
 have sent you

26
00:02:57,611 --> 00:03:02,211
2 For verily I say unto you, blessed is he that

27
00:03:02,211 --> 00:03:06,811
 keepeth my commandments, whether in life or in

28
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:11,411
 death; and he that is faithful in tribulation, the

29
00:03:11,411 --> 00:03:16,011
 reward of the same is greater in the kingdom of

30
00:03:16,011 --> 00:03:20,611
 heaven

31
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:25,867
3 Ye cannot behold with your natural eyes, for the

32
00:03:25,867 --> 00:03:30,867
 present time, the design of your God concerning

33
00:03:30,867 --> 00:03:35,867
 those things which shall come hereafter, and the

34
00:03:35,867 --> 00:03:40,867
 glory which shall follow after much tribulation

35
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:46,387
4 For after much tribulation come the blessings.

36
00:03:46,387 --> 00:03:51,887
 Wherefore the day cometh that ye shall be crowned

37
00:03:51,887 --> 00:03:57,387
 with much glory; the hour is not yet, but is nigh

38
00:03:57,387 --> 00:04:02,887
 at hand

39
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:09,209
5 Remember this, which I tell you before, that you

40
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:15,542
 may lay it to heart, and receive that which is to

41
00:04:15,542 --> 00:04:21,875
 follow

42
00:04:21,645 --> 00:04:26,395
6 Behold, verily I say unto you, for this cause I

43
00:04:26,395 --> 00:04:31,145
 have sent you—that you might be obedient, and that

44
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:35,895
 your hearts might be prepared to bear testimony

45
00:04:35,895 --> 00:04:40,645
 of the things which are to come

46
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:46,914
7 And also that you might be honored in laying the

47
00:04:46,914 --> 00:04:52,914
 foundation, and in bearing record of the land

48
00:04:52,914 --> 00:04:58,914
 upon which the Zion of God shall stand

49
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:03,698
8 And also that a feast of fat things might be

50
00:05:03,698 --> 00:05:09,098
 prepared for the poor; yea, a feast of fat things, of

51
00:05:09,098 --> 00:05:14,498
 wine on the lees well refined, that the earth may

52
00:05:14,498 --> 00:05:19,898
 know that the mouths of the prophets shall not

53
00:05:19,898 --> 00:05:25,298
 fail

54
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:31,826
9 Yea, a supper of the house of the Lord, well

55
00:05:31,826 --> 00:05:37,826
 prepared, unto which all nations shall be invited

56
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:42,587
10 First, the rich and the learned, the wise and

57
00:05:42,587 --> 00:05:47,587
 the noble

58
00:05:47,364 --> 00:05:53,364
11 And after that cometh the day of my power; then

59
00:05:53,364 --> 00:05:59,364
 shall the poor, the lame, and the blind, and the

60
00:05:59,364 --> 00:06:05,364
 deaf, come in unto the marriage of the Lamb, and

61
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:11,364
 partake of the supper of the Lord, prepared for the

62
00:06:11,364 --> 00:06:17,364
 great day to come

63
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:25,627
12 Behold, I, the Lord, have spoken it

64
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:30,135
13 And that the testimony might go forth from

65
00:06:30,135 --> 00:06:35,135
 Zion, yea, from the mouth of the city of the heritage

66
00:06:35,135 --> 00:06:40,135
 of God

67
00:06:40,4 --> 00:06:45,733
14 Yea, for this cause I have sent you hither, and

68
00:06:45,733 --> 00:06:51,066
 have selected my servant Edward Partridge, and

69
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:56,399
 have appointed unto him his mission in this land

70
00:06:56,383 --> 00:07:01,716
15 But if he repent not of his sins, which are

71
00:07:01,716 --> 00:07:07,049
 unbelief and blindness of heart, let him take heed

72
00:07:07,049 --> 00:07:12,382
 lest he fall

73
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:17,182
16 Behold his mission is given unto him, and it

74
00:07:17,182 --> 00:07:21,682
 shall not be given again

75
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:27,974
17 And whoso standeth in this mission is appointed

76
00:07:27,974 --> 00:07:34,474
 to be a judge in Israel, like as it was in

77
00:07:34,474 --> 00:07:40,974
 ancient days, to divide the lands of the heritage of God

78
00:07:40,974 --> 00:07:47,474
 unto his children

79
00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:54,001
18 And to judge his people by the testimony of the

80
00:07:54,001 --> 00:08:00,251
 just, and by the assistance of his counselors,

81
00:08:00,251 --> 00:08:06,501
 according to the laws of the kingdom which are given

82
00:08:06,501 --> 00:08:12,751
 by the prophets of God

83
00:08:12,275 --> 00:08:16,775
19 For verily I say unto you, my law shall be kept

84
00:08:16,775 --> 00:08:21,275
 on this land

85
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:26,567
20 Let no man think he is ruler; but let God rule

86
00:08:26,567 --> 00:08:32,067
 him that judgeth, according to the counsel of his

87
00:08:32,067 --> 00:08:37,567
 own will, or, in other words, him that counseleth

88
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:43,067
 or sitteth upon the judgment seat

89
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:48,389
21 Let no man break the laws of the land, for he

90
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:53,722
 that keepeth the laws of God hath no need to break

91
00:08:53,722 --> 00:08:59,055
 the laws of the land

92
00:08:59,355 --> 00:09:06,688
22 Wherefore, be subject to the powers that be,

93
00:09:06,688 --> 00:09:14,021
 until he reigns whose right it is to reign, and

94
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:21,354
 subdues all enemies under his feet

95
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:27,111
23 Behold, the laws which ye have received from my

96
00:09:27,111 --> 00:09:32,361
 hand are the laws of the church, and in this

97
00:09:32,361 --> 00:09:37,611
 light ye shall hold them forth. Behold, here is

98
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:42,861
 wisdom

99
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:48,649
24 And now, as I spake concerning my servant

100
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:54,649
 Edward Partridge, this land is the land of his

101
00:09:54,649 --> 00:10:00,649
 residence, and those whom he has appointed for his

102
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:06,649
 counselors; and also the land of the residence of him

103
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:12,649
 whom I have appointed to keep my storehouse

104
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:16,912
25 Wherefore, let them bring their families to

105
00:10:16,912 --> 00:10:20,912
 this land, as they shall counsel between themselves

106
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:24,912
 and me

107
00:10:24,674 --> 00:10:31,174
26 For behold, it is not meet that I should

108
00:10:31,174 --> 00:10:37,674
 command in all things; for he that is compelled in all

109
00:10:37,674 --> 00:10:44,174
 things, the same is a slothful and not a wise

110
00:10:44,174 --> 00:10:50,674
 servant; wherefore he receiveth no reward

111
00:10:50,95 --> 00:10:57,95
27 Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged

112
00:10:57,95 --> 00:11:04,95
 in a good cause, and do many things of their own

113
00:11:04,95 --> 00:11:11,95
 free will, and bring to pass much righteousness

114
00:11:11,955 --> 00:11:18,288
28 For the power is in them, wherein they are

115
00:11:18,288 --> 00:11:24,621
 agents unto themselves. And inasmuch as men do good

116
00:11:24,621 --> 00:11:30,954
 they shall in nowise lose their reward

117
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:37,207
29 But he that doeth not anything until he is

118
00:11:37,207 --> 00:11:43,457
 commanded, and receiveth a commandment with doubtful

119
00:11:43,457 --> 00:11:49,707
 heart, and keepeth it with slothfulness, the same

120
00:11:49,707 --> 00:11:55,957
 is damned

121
00:11:55,982 --> 00:12:01,315
30 Who am I that made man, saith the Lord, that

122
00:12:01,315 --> 00:12:06,648
 will hold him guiltless that obeys not my

123
00:12:06,648 --> 00:12:11,981
 commandments

124
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:15,981
31 Who am I, saith the Lord, that have promised

125
00:12:15,981 --> 00:12:20,481
 and have not fulfilled

126
00:12:20,056 --> 00:12:25,056
32 I command and men obey not; I revoke and they

127
00:12:25,056 --> 00:12:30,056
 receive not the blessing

128
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:36,833
33 Then they say in their hearts: This is not the

129
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:42,833
 work of the Lord, for his promises are not

130
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:48,833
 fulfilled. But wo unto such, for their reward lurketh

131
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:54,833
 beneath, and not from above

132
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:58,874
34 And now I give unto you further directions

133
00:12:58,874 --> 00:13:02,874
 concerning this land

134
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:06,481
35 It is wisdom in me that my servant Martin

135
00:13:06,481 --> 00:13:10,814
 Harris should be an example unto the church, in laying

136
00:13:10,814 --> 00:13:15,147
 his moneys before the bishop of the church

137
00:13:15,912 --> 00:13:21,162
36 And also, this is a law unto every man that

138
00:13:21,162 --> 00:13:26,412
 cometh unto this land to receive an inheritance; and

139
00:13:26,412 --> 00:13:31,662
 he shall do with his moneys according as the law

140
00:13:31,662 --> 00:13:36,912
 directs

141
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:40,666
37 And it is wisdom also that there should be

142
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:44,416
 lands purchased in Independence, for the place of the

143
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:48,166
 storehouse, and also for the house of the

144
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:51,916
 printing

145
00:13:51,681 --> 00:13:56,431
38 And other directions concerning my servant

146
00:13:56,431 --> 00:14:01,181
 Martin Harris shall be given him of the Spirit, that

147
00:14:01,181 --> 00:14:05,931
 he may receive his inheritance as seemeth him good

148
00:14:05,931 --> 00:14:10,681


149
00:14:10,7 --> 00:14:16,2
39 And let him repent of his sins, for he seeketh

150
00:14:16,2 --> 00:14:21,7
 the praise of the world

151
00:14:21,711 --> 00:14:26,711
40 And also let my servant William W. Phelps stand

152
00:14:26,711 --> 00:14:31,711
 in the office to which I have appointed him, and

153
00:14:31,711 --> 00:14:36,711
 receive his inheritance in the land

154
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:40,726
41 And also he hath need to repent, for I, the

155
00:14:40,726 --> 00:14:44,976
 Lord, am not well pleased with him, for he seeketh to

156
00:14:44,976 --> 00:14:49,226
 excel, and he is not sufficiently meek before me

157
00:14:49,226 --> 00:14:53,476


158
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:57,259
42 Behold, he who has repented of his sins, the

159
00:14:57,259 --> 00:15:01,259
 same is forgiven, and I, the Lord, remember them no

160
00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:05,259
 more

161
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:10,637
43 By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his

162
00:15:10,637 --> 00:15:15,97
 sins—behold, he will confess them and forsake them

163
00:15:15,97 --> 00:15:21,303


164
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:25,72
44 And now, verily, I say concerning the residue

165
00:15:25,72 --> 00:15:30,387
 of the elders of my church, the time has not yet

166
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:35,054
 come, for many years, for them to receive their

167
00:15:35,054 --> 00:15:39,721
 inheritance in this land, except they desire it

168
00:15:39,721 --> 00:15:44,388
 through the prayer of faith, only as it shall be

169
00:15:44,388 --> 00:15:49,055
 appointed unto them of the Lord

170
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:53,348
45 For, behold, they shall push the people

171
00:15:53,348 --> 00:15:57,348
 together from the ends of the earth

172
00:15:57,657 --> 00:16:02,907
46 Wherefore, assemble yourselves together; and

173
00:16:02,907 --> 00:16:08,157
 they who are not appointed to stay in this land, let

174
00:16:08,157 --> 00:16:13,407
 them preach the gospel in the regions round

175
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:18,657
 about; and after that let them return to their homes

176
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:26,378
47 Let them preach by the way, and bear testimony

177
00:16:26,378 --> 00:16:34,045
 of the truth in all places, and call upon the

178
00:16:34,045 --> 00:16:41,712
 rich, the high and the low, and the poor to repent

179
00:16:41,217 --> 00:16:46,217
48 And let them build up churches, inasmuch as the

180
00:16:46,217 --> 00:16:51,217
 inhabitants of the earth will repent

181
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:59,178
49 And let there be an agent appointed by the

182
00:16:59,178 --> 00:17:06,845
 voice of the church, unto the church in Ohio, to

183
00:17:06,845 --> 00:17:14,512
 receive moneys to purchase lands in Zion

184
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:20,767
50 And I give unto my servant Sidney Rigdon a

185
00:17:20,767 --> 00:17:27,267
 commandment, that he shall write a description of the

186
00:17:27,267 --> 00:17:33,767
 land of Zion, and a statement of the will of God,

187
00:17:33,767 --> 00:17:40,267
 as it shall be made known by the Spirit unto him

188
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:46,626
51 And an epistle and subscription, to be

189
00:17:46,626 --> 00:17:52,459
 presented unto all the churches to obtain moneys, to be

190
00:17:52,459 --> 00:17:58,292
 put into the hands of the bishop, of himself or the

191
00:17:58,292 --> 00:18:04,125
 agent, as seemeth him good or as he shall direct,

192
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:09,958
 to purchase lands for an inheritance for the

193
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:15,791
 children of God

194
00:18:15,077 --> 00:18:19,277
52 For, behold, verily I say unto you, the Lord

195
00:18:19,277 --> 00:18:23,477
 willeth that the disciples and the children of men

196
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:27,677
 should open their hearts, even to purchase this

197
00:18:27,677 --> 00:18:31,877
 whole region of country, as soon as time will permit

198
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:36,077


199
00:18:36,832 --> 00:18:42,832
53 Behold, here is wisdom. Let them do this lest

200
00:18:42,832 --> 00:18:48,832
 they receive none inheritance, save it be by the

201
00:18:48,832 --> 00:18:54,832
 shedding of blood

202
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:59,167
54 And again, inasmuch as there is land obtained,

203
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:03,5
 let there be workmen sent forth of all kinds unto

204
00:19:03,5 --> 00:19:07,833
 this land, to labor for the saints of God

205
00:19:07,88 --> 00:19:13,13
55 Let all these things be done in order; and let

206
00:19:13,13 --> 00:19:18,38
 the privileges of the lands be made known from

207
00:19:18,38 --> 00:19:23,63
 time to time, by the bishop or the agent of the

208
00:19:23,63 --> 00:19:28,88
 church

209
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:34,001
56 And let the work of the gathering be not in

210
00:19:34,001 --> 00:19:39,601
 haste, nor by flight; but let it be done as it shall

211
00:19:39,601 --> 00:19:45,201
 be counseled by the elders of the church at the

212
00:19:45,201 --> 00:19:50,801
 conferences, according to the knowledge which they

213
00:19:50,801 --> 00:19:56,401
 receive from time to time

214
00:19:56,145 --> 00:20:00,478
57 And let my servant Sidney Rigdon consecrate and

215
00:20:00,478 --> 00:20:04,811
 dedicate this land, and the spot for the temple,

216
00:20:04,811 --> 00:20:09,144
 unto the Lord

217
00:20:09,425 --> 00:20:15,258
58 And let a conference meeting be called; and

218
00:20:15,258 --> 00:20:21,091
 after that let my servants Sidney Rigdon and Joseph

219
00:20:21,091 --> 00:20:26,924
 Smith, Jun., return, and also Oliver Cowdery with

220
00:20:26,924 --> 00:20:32,757
 them, to accomplish the residue of the work which I

221
00:20:32,757 --> 00:20:38,59
 have appointed unto them in their own land, and

222
00:20:38,59 --> 00:20:44,423
 the residue as shall be ruled by the conferences

223
00:20:44,91 --> 00:20:49,577
59 And let no man return from this land except he

224
00:20:49,577 --> 00:20:54,244
 bear record by the way, of that which he knows and

225
00:20:54,244 --> 00:20:58,911
 most assuredly believes

226
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:04,174
60 Let that which has been bestowed upon Ziba

227
00:21:04,174 --> 00:21:09,674
 Peterson be taken from him; and let him stand as a

228
00:21:09,674 --> 00:21:15,174
 member in the church, and labor with his own hands,

229
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:20,674
 with the brethren, until he is sufficiently

230
00:21:20,674 --> 00:21:26,174
 chastened for all his sins; for he confesseth them not,

231
00:21:26,174 --> 00:21:31,674
 and he thinketh to hide them

232
00:21:31,941 --> 00:21:36,691
61 Let the residue of the elders of this church,

233
00:21:36,691 --> 00:21:41,441
 who are coming to this land, some of whom are

234
00:21:41,441 --> 00:21:46,191
 exceedingly blessed even above measure, also hold a

235
00:21:46,191 --> 00:21:50,941
 conference upon this land

236
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:55,709
62 And let my servant Edward Partridge direct the

237
00:21:55,709 --> 00:22:00,709
 conference which shall be held by them

238
00:22:00,769 --> 00:22:05,436
63 And let them also return, preaching the gospel

239
00:22:05,436 --> 00:22:10,103
 by the way, bearing record of the things which are

240
00:22:10,103 --> 00:22:14,77
 revealed unto them
