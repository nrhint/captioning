00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 31 Revelation given through Joseph

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Smith the Prophet to Thomas B. Marsh, September

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
1830. The occasion was immediately following

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
a conference of the Church (see the 
heading

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
to section 30). Thomas B. Marsh had been

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
baptized earlier in the month and had been

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
ordained an elder in the Church before this

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
revelation was given. 
1–6, Thomas B. Marsh is

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
called to preach the gospel and is assured of his

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
family’s well-being; 
7–13, He is counseled

11
00:00:00,0 --> 01:09:57,
to be patient, pray always, and follow the Comforter. 

12
01:09:57,0 --> 01:09:57,0
1 Thomas, my son, blessed are you

13
01:09:57,0 --> 01:13:36,
because of your faith in my work.

14
01:13:36,0 --> 01:13:36,0
2 Behold, you have had many

15
01:13:36,0 --> 01:13:36,0
afflictions because of your family;

16
01:13:36,0 --> 01:13:36,0
nevertheless, I will bless you

17
01:13:36,0 --> 01:13:36,0
and your family, yea, your little

18
01:13:36,0 --> 01:13:36,0
ones; and the day cometh that

19
01:13:36,0 --> 01:13:36,0
they will believe and know the

20
01:13:36,0 --> 01:19:41,
truth and be one with you in my church.

21
01:19:41,0 --> 01:19:41,0
3 Lift up your heart and

22
01:19:41,0 --> 01:19:41,0
rejoice, for the hour of your

23
01:19:41,0 --> 01:19:41,0
mission is come; and your tongue

24
01:19:41,0 --> 01:19:41,0
shall be loosed, and you

25
01:19:41,0 --> 01:19:41,0
shall declare glad tidings of

26
01:19:41,0 --> 01:42:41,
great joy unto this generation.

27
01:42:41,0 --> 01:42:41,0
4 You shall declare the

28
01:42:41,0 --> 01:42:41,0
things which have been revealed

29
01:42:41,0 --> 01:42:41,0
to my servant, Joseph Smith,

30
01:42:41,0 --> 01:42:41,0
Jun. You shall begin to

31
01:42:41,0 --> 01:42:41,0
preach from this time forth,

32
01:42:41,0 --> 01:42:41,0
yea, to reap in the field

33
01:42:41,0 --> 02:01:40,
which is white already to be burned.

34
02:01:40,0 --> 02:01:40,0
5 Therefore, thrust in

35
02:01:40,0 --> 02:01:40,0
your sickle with all your

36
02:01:40,0 --> 02:01:40,0
soul, and your sins are

37
02:01:40,0 --> 02:01:40,0
forgiven you, and you shall be

38
02:01:40,0 --> 02:01:40,0
laden with sheaves upon

39
02:01:40,0 --> 02:01:40,0
your back, for the laborer

40
02:01:40,0 --> 02:01:40,0
is worthy of his hire.

41
02:01:40,0 --> 01:57:20,
Wherefore, your family shall live.

42
01:57:20,0 --> 01:57:20,0
6 Behold, verily I say

43
01:57:20,0 --> 01:57:20,0
unto you, go from them only

44
01:57:20,0 --> 01:57:20,0
for a little time, and

45
01:57:20,0 --> 01:57:20,0
declare my word, and I

46
01:57:20,0 --> 02:02:25,
will prepare a place for them.

47
02:02:25,0 --> 02:02:25,0
7 Yea, I will open the

48
02:02:25,0 --> 02:02:25,0
hearts of the people,

49
02:02:25,0 --> 02:02:25,0
and they will receive

50
02:02:25,0 --> 02:02:25,0
you. And I will establish

51
02:02:25,0 --> 02:11:28,
a church by your hand;

52
02:11:28,0 --> 02:11:28,0
8 And you shall

53
02:11:28,0 --> 02:11:28,0
strengthen them and

54
02:11:28,0 --> 02:11:28,0
prepare them

55
02:11:28,0 --> 02:11:28,0
against the time when

56
02:11:28,0 --> 02:17:33,
they shall be gathered.

57
02:17:33,0 --> 02:17:33,0
9 Be patient in

58
02:17:33,0 --> 02:17:33,0
afflictions,

59
02:17:33,0 --> 02:17:33,0
revile not against

60
02:17:33,0 --> 02:17:33,0
those that

61
02:17:33,0 --> 02:17:33,0
revile. Govern your

62
02:17:33,0 --> 02:17:33,0
house in

63
02:17:33,0 --> 02:23:38,
meekness, and be steadfast.

64
02:23:38,0 --> 02:23:38,0
10 Behold, I

65
02:23:38,0 --> 02:23:38,0
say unto you that

66
02:23:38,0 --> 02:23:38,0
you shall be a

67
02:23:38,0 --> 02:23:38,0
physician unto

68
02:23:38,0 --> 02:23:38,0
the church,

69
02:23:38,0 --> 02:23:38,0
but not unto the

70
02:23:38,0 --> 02:23:38,0
world, for they

71
02:23:38,0 --> 02:26:12,
will not receive you.

72
02:26:12,0 --> 02:26:12,0
11 Go your

73
02:26:12,0 --> 02:26:12,0
way

74
02:26:12,0 --> 02:26:12,0
whithersoever I will,

75
02:26:12,0 --> 02:26:12,0
and it shall be

76
02:26:12,0 --> 02:26:12,0
given you by

77
02:26:12,0 --> 02:26:12,0
the

78
02:26:12,0 --> 02:26:12,0
Comforter what you

79
02:26:12,0 --> 02:26:12,0
shall do and

80
02:26:12,0 --> 02:45:11,
whither you shall go.

81
02:45:11,0 --> 02:45:11,0
12 Pray

82
02:45:11,0 --> 02:45:11,0
always, lest

83
02:45:11,0 --> 02:45:11,0
you enter

84
02:45:11,0 --> 02:45:11,0
into

85
02:45:11,0 --> 02:45:11,0
temptation and lose

86
02:45:11,0 --> 02:55:43,
your reward.

87
02:55:43,0 --> 02:55:43,0
13 Be

88
02:55:43,0 --> 02:55:43,0
faithful unto

89
02:55:43,0 --> 02:55:43,0
the end,

90
02:55:43,0 --> 02:55:43,0
and lo, I

91
02:55:43,0 --> 02:55:43,0
am with

92
02:55:43,0 --> 02:55:43,0
you. These

93
02:55:43,0 --> 02:55:43,0
words are

94
02:55:43,0 --> 02:55:43,0
not of man

95
02:55:43,0 --> 02:55:43,0
nor of men,

96
02:55:43,0 --> 02:55:43,0
but of

97
02:55:43,0 --> 02:55:43,0
me, even

98
02:55:43,0 --> 02:55:43,0
Jesus Christ,

99
02:55:43,0 --> 02:55:43,0
your

100
02:55:43,0 --> 02:55:43,0
Redeemer, by

101
02:55:43,0 --> 02:55:43,0
the will of

102
02:55:43,0 --> 02:59:50,
the Father. Amen.
