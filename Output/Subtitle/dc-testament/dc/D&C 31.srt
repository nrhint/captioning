00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:16,642
Section 31 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:22,006
 the Prophet to Thomas B. Marsh, September 1830. The

3
00:00:22,006 --> 00:00:27,37
 occasion was immediately following a conference

4
00:00:27,37 --> 00:00:32,734
 of the Church (see the 
heading to section 30).

5
00:00:32,734 --> 00:00:38,098
 Thomas B. Marsh had been baptized earlier in the

6
00:00:38,098 --> 00:00:43,462
 month and had been ordained an elder in the Church

7
00:00:43,462 --> 00:00:48,826
 before this revelation was given. 
1–6, Thomas B.

8
00:00:48,826 --> 00:00:54,19
 Marsh is called to preach the gospel and is assured

9
00:00:54,19 --> 00:00:59,554
 of his family’s well-being; 
7–13, He is counseled

10
00:00:59,554 --> 00:01:04,918
 to be patient, pray always, and follow the

11
00:01:04,918 --> 00:01:10,282
 Comforter.

12
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:15,704
1 Thomas, my son, blessed are you because of your

13
00:01:15,704 --> 00:01:20,704
 faith in my work

14
00:01:20,53 --> 00:01:25,33
2 Behold, you have had many afflictions because of

15
00:01:25,33 --> 00:01:30,13
 your family; nevertheless, I will bless you and

16
00:01:30,13 --> 00:01:34,93
 your family, yea, your little ones; and the day

17
00:01:34,93 --> 00:01:39,73
 cometh that they will believe and know the truth and

18
00:01:39,73 --> 00:01:44,53
 be one with you in my church

19
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:48,771
3 Lift up your heart and rejoice, for the hour of

20
00:01:48,771 --> 00:01:53,521
 your mission is come; and your tongue shall be

21
00:01:53,521 --> 00:01:58,271
 loosed, and you shall declare glad tidings of great

22
00:01:58,271 --> 00:02:03,021
 joy unto this generation

23
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:08,123
4 You shall declare the things which have been

24
00:02:08,123 --> 00:02:12,723
 revealed to my servant, Joseph Smith, Jun. You shall

25
00:02:12,723 --> 00:02:17,323
 begin to preach from this time forth, yea, to reap

26
00:02:17,323 --> 00:02:21,923
 in the field which is white already to be burned

27
00:02:21,923 --> 00:02:26,523


28
00:02:26,78 --> 00:02:33,98
5 Therefore, thrust in your sickle with all your

29
00:02:33,98 --> 00:02:41,18
 soul, and your sins are forgiven you, and you shall

30
00:02:41,18 --> 00:02:48,38
 be laden with sheaves upon your back, for the

31
00:02:48,38 --> 00:02:55,58
 laborer is worthy of his hire. Wherefore, your family

32
00:02:55,58 --> 00:03:02,78
 shall live

33
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:07,932
6 Behold, verily I say unto you, go from them only

34
00:03:07,932 --> 00:03:13,599
 for a little time, and declare my word, and I

35
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:19,266
 will prepare a place for them

36
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:25,615
7 Yea, I will open the hearts of the people, and

37
00:03:25,615 --> 00:03:31,948
 they will receive you. And I will establish a

38
00:03:31,948 --> 00:03:38,281
 church by your hand

39
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:43,051
8 And you shall strengthen them and prepare them

40
00:03:43,051 --> 00:03:48,051
 against the time when they shall be gathered

41
00:03:48,345 --> 00:03:54,678
9 Be patient in afflictions, revile not against

42
00:03:54,678 --> 00:04:01,011
 those that revile. Govern your house in meekness,

43
00:04:01,011 --> 00:04:07,344
 and be steadfast

44
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:12,447
10 Behold, I say unto you that you shall be a

45
00:04:12,447 --> 00:04:17,78
 physician unto the church, but not unto the world, for

46
00:04:17,78 --> 00:04:23,113
 they will not receive you

47
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:28,429
11 Go your way whithersoever I will, and it shall

48
00:04:28,429 --> 00:04:33,762
 be given you by the Comforter what you shall do

49
00:04:33,762 --> 00:04:39,095
 and whither you shall go

50
00:04:39,396 --> 00:04:45,896
12 Pray always, lest you enter into temptation and

51
00:04:45,896 --> 00:04:52,396
 lose your reward

52
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:59,159
13 Be faithful unto the end, and lo, I am with

53
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:05,909
 you. These words are not of man nor of men, but of

54
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:12,659
 me, even Jesus Christ, your Redeemer, by the will of

55
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:19,409
 the Father. Amen.
