00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:05,273
Section 31 Revelation given through Joseph

2
00:00:05,273 --> 00:00:10,546
Smith the Prophet to Thomas B. Marsh, September

3
00:00:10,546 --> 00:00:15,819
1830. The occasion was immediately following

4
00:00:15,819 --> 00:00:21,092
a conference of the Church (see the 
heading

5
00:00:21,092 --> 00:00:26,365
to section 30). Thomas B. Marsh had been

6
00:00:26,365 --> 00:00:31,638
baptized earlier in the month and had been

7
00:00:31,638 --> 00:00:36,911
ordained an elder in the Church before this

8
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:42,184
revelation was given. 
1–6, Thomas B. Marsh is

9
00:00:42,184 --> 00:00:47,457
called to preach the gospel and is assured of his

10
00:00:47,457 --> 00:00:52,73
family’s well-being; 
7–13, He is counseled

11
00:00:52,73 --> 00:00:58,959
to be patient, pray always, and follow the Comforter. 

12
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:04,959
1 Thomas, my son, blessed are you

13
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:10,604
because of your faith in my work.

14
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:11,89
2 Behold, you have had many

15
00:01:11,89 --> 00:01:13,176
afflictions because of your family;

16
00:01:13,176 --> 00:01:14,462
nevertheless, I will bless you

17
00:01:14,462 --> 00:01:15,748
and your family, yea, your little

18
00:01:15,748 --> 00:01:17,034
ones; and the day cometh that

19
00:01:17,034 --> 00:01:18,32
they will believe and know the

20
00:01:18,32 --> 00:01:19,663
truth and be one with you in my church.

21
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:23,496
3 Lift up your heart and

22
00:01:23,496 --> 00:01:27,329
rejoice, for the hour of your

23
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:31,162
mission is come; and your tongue

24
00:01:31,162 --> 00:01:34,995
shall be loosed, and you

25
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:38,828
shall declare glad tidings of

26
00:01:38,828 --> 00:01:42,703
great joy unto this generation.

27
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:45,56
4 You shall declare the

28
00:01:45,56 --> 00:01:48,417
things which have been revealed

29
00:01:48,417 --> 00:01:51,274
to my servant, Joseph Smith,

30
00:01:51,274 --> 00:01:54,131
Jun. You shall begin to

31
00:01:54,131 --> 00:01:56,988
preach from this time forth,

32
00:01:56,988 --> 00:01:59,845
yea, to reap in the field

33
00:01:59,845 --> 00:02:02,339
which is white already to be burned.

34
00:02:02,339 --> 00:02:02,589
5 Therefore, thrust in

35
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:02,839
your sickle with all your

36
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:03,089
soul, and your sins are

37
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:03,339
forgiven you, and you shall be

38
00:02:03,339 --> 00:02:03,589
laden with sheaves upon

39
00:02:03,589 --> 00:02:03,839
your back, for the laborer

40
00:02:03,839 --> 00:02:04,089
is worthy of his hire.

41
00:02:04,089 --> 00:02:04,408
Wherefore, your family shall live.

42
00:02:04,408 --> 00:02:09,608
6 Behold, verily I say

43
00:02:09,608 --> 00:02:14,808
unto you, go from them only

44
00:02:14,808 --> 00:02:20,008
for a little time, and

45
00:02:20,008 --> 00:02:25,208
declare my word, and I

46
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:30,45
will prepare a place for them.

47
00:02:30,45 --> 00:02:36,45
7 Yea, I will open the

48
00:02:36,45 --> 00:02:42,45
hearts of the people,

49
00:02:42,45 --> 00:02:48,45
and they will receive

50
00:02:48,45 --> 00:02:54,45
you. And I will establish

51
00:02:54,45 --> 00:03:00,514
a church by your hand;

52
00:03:00,514 --> 00:02:59,714
8 And you shall

53
00:02:59,714 --> 00:02:58,914
strengthen them and

54
00:02:58,914 --> 00:02:58,114
prepare them

55
00:02:58,114 --> 00:02:57,314
against the time when

56
00:02:57,314 --> 00:02:56,176
they shall be gathered.

57
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:56,747
9 Be patient in

58
00:02:56,747 --> 00:02:57,318
afflictions,

59
00:02:57,318 --> 00:02:57,889
revile not against

60
00:02:57,889 --> 00:02:58,46
those that

61
00:02:58,46 --> 00:02:59,031
revile. Govern your

62
00:02:59,031 --> 00:02:59,602
house in

63
00:02:59,602 --> 00:03:00,797
meekness, and be steadfast.

64
00:03:00,797 --> 00:03:02,047
10 Behold, I

65
00:03:02,047 --> 00:03:03,297
say unto you that

66
00:03:03,297 --> 00:03:04,547
you shall be a

67
00:03:04,547 --> 00:03:05,797
physician unto

68
00:03:05,797 --> 00:03:07,047
the church,

69
00:03:07,047 --> 00:03:08,297
but not unto the

70
00:03:08,297 --> 00:03:09,547
world, for they

71
00:03:09,547 --> 00:03:10,857
will not receive you.

72
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:11,635
11 Go your

73
00:03:11,635 --> 00:03:12,413
way

74
00:03:12,413 --> 00:03:13,191
whithersoever I will,

75
00:03:13,191 --> 00:03:13,969
and it shall be

76
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:14,747
given you by

77
00:03:14,747 --> 00:03:15,525
the

78
00:03:15,525 --> 00:03:16,303
Comforter what you

79
00:03:16,303 --> 00:03:17,081
shall do and

80
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:17,914
whither you shall go.

81
00:03:17,914 --> 00:03:21,247
12 Pray

82
00:03:21,247 --> 00:03:24,58
always, lest

83
00:03:24,58 --> 00:03:27,913
you enter

84
00:03:27,913 --> 00:03:31,246
into

85
00:03:31,246 --> 00:03:34,579
temptation and lose

86
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:37,551
your reward.

87
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:38,176
13 Be

88
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:38,801
faithful unto

89
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:39,426
the end,

90
00:03:39,426 --> 00:03:40,051
and lo, I

91
00:03:40,051 --> 00:03:40,676
am with

92
00:03:40,676 --> 00:03:41,301
you. These

93
00:03:41,301 --> 00:03:41,926
words are

94
00:03:41,926 --> 00:03:42,551
not of man

95
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:43,176
nor of men,

96
00:03:43,176 --> 00:03:43,801
but of

97
00:03:43,801 --> 00:03:44,426
me, even

98
00:03:44,426 --> 00:03:45,051
Jesus Christ,

99
00:03:45,051 --> 00:03:45,676
your

100
00:03:45,676 --> 00:03:46,301
Redeemer, by

101
00:03:46,301 --> 00:03:46,926
the will of

102
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:47,611
the Father. Amen.
