 appointed a conference to be held early in the month of

00:00:56,657 --> 00:01:01,057
1 Behold, thus saith the Lord unto you my

10
00:01:01,057 --> 00:01:05,457
 servants, it is expedient in me that the elders of my

11
00:01:05,457 --> 00:01:09,857
 church should be called together, from the east and

12
00:01:09,857 --> 00:01:14,257
 from the west, and from the north and from the

13
00:01:14,257 --> 00:01:18,657
 south, by letter or some other way

14
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:21,645
2 And it shall come to pass, that inasmuch as they

15
00:01:21,645 --> 00:01:25,145
 are faithful, and exercise faith in me, I will

16
00:01:25,145 --> 00:01:28,645
 pour out my Spirit upon them in the day that they

17
00:01:28,645 --> 00:01:32,145
 assemble themselves together

18
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:36,56
3 And it shall come to pass that they shall go

19
00:01:36,56 --> 00:01:40,227
 forth into the regions round about, and preach

20
00:01:40,227 --> 00:01:43,894
 repentance unto the people

21
00:01:43,67 --> 00:01:47,67
4 And many shall be converted, insomuch that ye

22
00:01:47,67 --> 00:01:51,67
 shall obtain power to organize yourselves according

23
00:01:51,67 --> 00:01:55,67
 to the laws of man

24
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:58,682
5 That your enemies may not have power over you;

25
00:01:58,682 --> 00:02:01,682
 that you may be preserved in all things; that you

26
00:02:01,682 --> 00:02:04,682
 may be enabled to keep my laws; that every bond may

27
00:02:04,682 --> 00:02:07,682
 be broken wherewith the enemy seeketh to destroy

28
00:02:07,682 --> 00:02:10,682
 my people

29
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:15,331
6 Behold, I say unto you, that ye must visit the

30
00:02:15,331 --> 00:02:19,731
 poor and the needy and administer to their relief,

31
00:02:19,731 --> 00:02:24,131
 that they may be kept until all things may be done

32
00:02:24,131 --> 00:02:28,531
 according to my law which ye have received. Amen.

33
00:02:28,531 --> 00:02:32,931
