Section 44 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Prophet and Sidney Rigdon, at Kirtland, Ohio, in

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the latter part of February 1831. In compliance

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
with the requirement herein set forth, the Church

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
appointed a conference to be held early in the

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
month of June following. 
1–3, Elders are to

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
assemble in conference; 
4–6, They are to organize

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:28:07,
according to the laws of the land and to care for the poor. 

9
00:28:07,0 --> 00:28:07,0
1 Behold, thus saith the Lord unto you my

10
00:28:07,0 --> 00:28:07,0
servants, it is expedient in me that the elders of

11
00:28:07,0 --> 00:28:07,0
my church should be called together, from the

12
00:28:07,0 --> 00:28:07,0
east and from the west, and from the north

13
00:28:07,0 --> 00:34:48,
and from the south, by letter or some other way.

14
00:34:48,0 --> 00:34:48,0
2 And it shall come to pass, that inasmuch

15
00:34:48,0 --> 00:34:48,0
as they are faithful, and exercise faith in

16
00:34:48,0 --> 00:34:48,0
me, I will pour out my Spirit upon them in

17
00:34:48,0 --> 00:38:47,
the day that they assemble themselves together.

18
00:38:47,0 --> 00:38:47,0
3 And it shall come to pass that they

19
00:38:47,0 --> 00:38:47,0
shall go forth into the regions round

20
00:38:47,0 --> 00:46:17,
about, and preach repentance unto the people.

21
00:46:17,0 --> 00:46:17,0
4 And many shall be converted, insomuch

22
00:46:17,0 --> 00:46:17,0
that ye shall obtain power to organize

23
00:46:17,0 --> 00:50:30,
yourselves according to the laws of man;

24
00:50:30,0 --> 00:50:30,0
5 That your enemies may not have

25
00:50:30,0 --> 00:50:30,0
power over you; that you may be

26
00:50:30,0 --> 00:50:30,0
preserved in all things; that you may be

27
00:50:30,0 --> 00:50:30,0
enabled to keep my laws; that

28
00:50:30,0 --> 00:50:30,0
every bond may be broken wherewith the

29
00:50:30,0 --> 00:57:39,
enemy seeketh to destroy my people.

30
00:57:39,0 --> 00:57:39,0
6 Behold, I say unto you, that ye

31
00:57:39,0 --> 00:57:39,0
must visit the poor and the

32
00:57:39,0 --> 00:57:39,0
needy and administer to their relief,

33
00:57:39,0 --> 00:57:39,0
that they may be kept until all

34
00:57:39,0 --> 00:57:39,0
things may be done according to

35
00:57:39,0 --> 00:59:51,
my law which ye have received. Amen.
