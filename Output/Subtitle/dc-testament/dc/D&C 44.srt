Section 44 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:07,0 --> 00:00:14,0
Prophet and Sidney Rigdon, at Kirtland, Ohio, in

3
00:00:14,0 --> 00:00:21,0
the latter part of February 1831. In compliance

4
00:00:21,0 --> 00:00:28,0
with the requirement herein set forth, the Church

5
00:00:28,0 --> 00:00:35,0
appointed a conference to be held early in the

6
00:00:35,0 --> 00:00:42,0
month of June following. 
1–3, Elders are to

7
00:00:42,0 --> 00:00:49,0
assemble in conference; 
4–6, They are to organize

8
00:00:49,0 --> 00:00:56,29
according to the laws of the land and to care for the poor. 

9
00:00:56,29 --> 00:00:58,29
1 Behold, thus saith the Lord unto you my

10
00:00:58,29 --> 00:01:00,29
servants, it is expedient in me that the elders of

11
00:01:00,29 --> 00:01:02,29
my church should be called together, from the

12
00:01:02,29 --> 00:01:04,29
east and from the west, and from the north

13
00:01:04,29 --> 00:01:06,633
and from the south, by letter or some other way.

14
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:09,383
2 And it shall come to pass, that inasmuch

15
00:01:09,383 --> 00:01:12,133
as they are faithful, and exercise faith in

16
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:14,883
me, I will pour out my Spirit upon them in

17
00:01:14,883 --> 00:01:17,01
the day that they assemble themselves together.

18
00:01:17,01 --> 00:01:22,01
3 And it shall come to pass that they

19
00:01:22,01 --> 00:01:27,01
shall go forth into the regions round

20
00:01:27,01 --> 00:01:32,492
about, and preach repentance unto the people.

21
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:35,825
4 And many shall be converted, insomuch

22
00:01:35,825 --> 00:01:39,158
that ye shall obtain power to organize

23
00:01:39,158 --> 00:01:42,869
yourselves according to the laws of man;

24
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:44,702
5 That your enemies may not have

25
00:01:44,702 --> 00:01:46,535
power over you; that you may be

26
00:01:46,535 --> 00:01:48,368
preserved in all things; that you may be

27
00:01:48,368 --> 00:01:50,201
enabled to keep my laws; that

28
00:01:50,201 --> 00:01:52,034
every bond may be broken wherewith the

29
00:01:52,034 --> 00:01:53,246
enemy seeketh to destroy my people.

30
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:55,579
6 Behold, I say unto you, that ye

31
00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:57,912
must visit the poor and the

32
00:01:57,912 --> 00:02:00,245
needy and administer to their relief,

33
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,578
that they may be kept until all

34
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:04,911
things may be done according to

35
00:02:04,911 --> 00:02:07,094
my law which ye have received. Amen.
