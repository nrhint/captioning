00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:17,373
Section 21 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:17,373 --> 00:00:23,468
 Prophet, at Fayette, New York, April 6, 1830. This

3
00:00:23,468 --> 00:00:29,563
 revelation was given at the organization of the

4
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:35,658
 Church, on the date named, in the home of Peter

5
00:00:35,658 --> 00:00:41,753
 Whitmer Sr. Six men, who had previously been baptized,

6
00:00:41,753 --> 00:00:47,848
 participated. By unanimous vote these persons

7
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:53,943
 expressed their desire and determination to organize,

8
00:00:53,943 --> 00:01:00,038
 according to the commandment of God (see

9
00:01:00,038 --> 00:01:06,133
section 20). They also voted to accept and sustain Joseph

10
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:12,228
 Smith Jr. and Oliver Cowdery as the presiding

11
00:01:12,228 --> 00:01:18,323
 officers of the Church. With the laying on of hands,

12
00:01:18,323 --> 00:01:24,418
 Joseph then ordained Oliver an elder of the Church,

13
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:30,513
 and Oliver similarly ordained Joseph. After

14
00:01:30,513 --> 00:01:36,608
 administration of the sacrament, Joseph and Oliver laid

15
00:01:36,608 --> 00:01:42,703
 hands upon the participants individually for the

16
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:48,798
 bestowal of the Holy Ghost and for the

17
00:01:48,798 --> 00:01:54,893
 confirmation of each as a member of the Church. 
1–3, Joseph

18
00:01:54,893 --> 00:02:00,988
 Smith is called to be a seer, translator, prophet,

19
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:07,083
 apostle, and elder; 
4–8, His word will guide the

20
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:13,178
 cause of Zion; 
9–12, The Saints will believe his

21
00:02:13,178 --> 00:02:19,273
 words as he speaks by the Comforter.

22
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:25,539
1 Behold, there shall be a record kept among you;

23
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:31,739
 and in it thou shalt be called a seer, a

24
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:37,939
 translator, a prophet, an apostle of Jesus Christ, an elder

25
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:44,139
 of the church through the will of God the Father,

26
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:50,339
 and the grace of your Lord Jesus Christ

27
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:55,438
2 Being inspired of the Holy Ghost to lay the

28
00:02:55,438 --> 00:03:00,105
 foundation thereof, and to build it up unto the most

29
00:03:00,105 --> 00:03:04,772
 holy faith

30
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:08,251
3 Which church was organized and established in

31
00:03:08,251 --> 00:03:11,751
 the year of your Lord eighteen hundred and thirty,

32
00:03:11,751 --> 00:03:15,251
 in the fourth month, and on the sixth day of the

33
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:18,751
 month which is called April

34
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:23,515
4 Wherefore, meaning the church, thou shalt give

35
00:03:23,515 --> 00:03:28,765
 heed unto all his words and commandments which he

36
00:03:28,765 --> 00:03:34,015
 shall give unto you as he receiveth them, walking

37
00:03:34,015 --> 00:03:39,265
 in all holiness before me

38
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:46,519
5 For his word ye shall receive, as if from mine

39
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:54,019
 own mouth, in all patience and faith

40
00:03:54,0 --> 00:04:00,2
6 For by doing these things the gates of hell

41
00:04:00,2 --> 00:04:06,4
 shall not prevail against you; yea, and the Lord God

42
00:04:06,4 --> 00:04:12,6
 will disperse the powers of darkness from before

43
00:04:12,6 --> 00:04:18,8
 you, and cause the heavens to shake for your good,

44
00:04:18,8 --> 00:04:25,0
 and his name’s glory

45
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:32,915
7 For thus saith the Lord God: Him have I inspired

46
00:04:32,915 --> 00:04:40,165
 to move the cause of Zion in mighty power for

47
00:04:40,165 --> 00:04:47,415
 good, and his diligence I know, and his prayers I

48
00:04:47,415 --> 00:04:54,665
 have heard

49
00:04:54,161 --> 00:05:00,361
8 Yea, his weeping for Zion I have seen, and I

50
00:05:00,361 --> 00:05:06,561
 will cause that he shall mourn for her no longer; for

51
00:05:06,561 --> 00:05:12,761
 his days of rejoicing are come unto the remission

52
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:18,961
 of his sins, and the manifestations of my

53
00:05:18,961 --> 00:05:25,161
 blessings upon his works

54
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:31,163
9 For, behold, I will bless all those who labor in

55
00:05:31,163 --> 00:05:36,734
 my vineyard with a mighty blessing, and they

56
00:05:36,734 --> 00:05:42,305
 shall believe on his words, which are given him

57
00:05:42,305 --> 00:05:47,876
 through me by the Comforter, which manifesteth that

58
00:05:47,876 --> 00:05:53,447
 Jesus was crucified by sinful men for the sins of the

59
00:05:53,447 --> 00:05:59,018
 world, yea, for the remission of sins unto the

60
00:05:59,018 --> 00:06:04,589
 contrite heart

61
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:10,264
10 Wherefore it behooveth me that he should be

62
00:06:10,264 --> 00:06:15,764
 ordained by you, Oliver Cowdery mine apostle

63
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:21,559
11 This being an ordinance unto you, that you are

64
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:27,309
 an elder under his hand, he being the first unto

65
00:06:27,309 --> 00:06:33,059
 you, that you might be an elder unto this church of

66
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:38,809
 Christ, bearing my name

67
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:44,564
12 And the first preacher of this church unto the

68
00:06:44,564 --> 00:06:51,064
 church, and before the world, yea, before the

69
00:06:51,064 --> 00:06:57,564
 Gentiles; yea, and thus saith the Lord God, lo, lo! to

70
00:06:57,564 --> 00:07:04,064
 the Jews also. Amen.
