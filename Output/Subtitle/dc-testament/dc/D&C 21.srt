1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:05,571
Section 21 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:05,571 --> 00:00:11,142
Prophet, at Fayette, New York, April 6, 1830. This

3
00:00:11,142 --> 00:00:16,713
revelation was given at the organization of the

4
00:00:16,713 --> 00:00:22,284
Church, on the date named, in the home of Peter

5
00:00:22,284 --> 00:00:27,855
Whitmer Sr. Six men, who had previously been

6
00:00:27,855 --> 00:00:33,426
baptized, participated. By unanimous vote these

7
00:00:33,426 --> 00:00:38,997
persons expressed their desire and determination to

8
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:44,568
organize, according to the commandment of God (see

9
00:00:44,568 --> 00:00:50,139
section 20). They also voted to accept and

10
00:00:50,139 --> 00:00:55,71
sustain Joseph Smith Jr. and Oliver Cowdery as the

11
00:00:55,71 --> 00:01:01,281
presiding officers of the Church. With the laying on

12
00:01:01,281 --> 00:01:06,852
of hands, Joseph then ordained Oliver an elder of

13
00:01:06,852 --> 00:01:12,423
the Church, and Oliver similarly ordained

14
00:01:12,423 --> 00:01:17,994
Joseph. After administration of the sacrament, Joseph

15
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:23,565
and Oliver laid hands upon the participants

16
00:01:23,565 --> 00:01:29,136
individually for the bestowal of the Holy Ghost and for

17
00:01:29,136 --> 00:01:34,707
the confirmation of each as a member of the

18
00:01:34,707 --> 00:01:40,278
Church. 
1–3, Joseph Smith is called to be a seer,

19
00:01:40,278 --> 00:01:45,849
translator, prophet, apostle, and elder; 
4–8, His

20
00:01:45,849 --> 00:01:51,42
word will guide the cause of Zion; 
9–12, The

21
00:01:51,42 --> 00:01:57,951
Saints will believe his words as he speaks by the Comforter. 

22
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:57,951
1 Behold, there shall be a record kept among

23
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:57,951
you; and in it thou shalt be called a seer, a

24
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:57,951
translator, a prophet, an apostle of Jesus Christ, an

25
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:57,951
elder of the church through the will of God the

26
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:57,017
Father, and the grace of your Lord Jesus Christ,

27
00:01:57,017 --> 00:02:04,017
2 Being inspired of the Holy Ghost

28
00:02:04,017 --> 00:02:11,017
to lay the foundation thereof, and to

29
00:02:11,017 --> 00:02:18,372
build it up unto the most holy faith.

30
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:20,372
3 Which church was organized and

31
00:02:20,372 --> 00:02:22,372
established in the year of your Lord

32
00:02:22,372 --> 00:02:24,372
eighteen hundred and thirty, in the

33
00:02:24,372 --> 00:02:26,372
fourth month, and on the sixth day

34
00:02:26,372 --> 00:02:28,715
of the month which is called April.

35
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:33,115
4 Wherefore, meaning the church,

36
00:02:33,115 --> 00:02:37,515
thou shalt give heed unto all his

37
00:02:37,515 --> 00:02:41,915
words and commandments which he shall

38
00:02:41,915 --> 00:02:46,315
give unto you as he receiveth them,

39
00:02:46,315 --> 00:02:50,07
walking in all holiness before me;

40
00:02:50,07 --> 00:02:54,737
5 For his word ye shall

41
00:02:54,737 --> 00:02:59,404
receive, as if from mine own

42
00:02:59,404 --> 00:03:04,384
mouth, in all patience and faith.

43
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:05,884
6 For by doing these things

44
00:03:05,884 --> 00:03:07,384
the gates of hell shall

45
00:03:07,384 --> 00:03:08,884
not prevail against you; yea,

46
00:03:08,884 --> 00:03:10,384
and the Lord God will

47
00:03:10,384 --> 00:03:11,884
disperse the powers of darkness

48
00:03:11,884 --> 00:03:13,384
from before you, and cause

49
00:03:13,384 --> 00:03:14,884
the heavens to shake for

50
00:03:14,884 --> 00:03:16,763
your good, and his name’s glory.

51
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:20,43
7 For thus saith the Lord

52
00:03:20,43 --> 00:03:24,097
God: Him have I inspired

53
00:03:24,097 --> 00:03:27,764
to move the cause of Zion

54
00:03:27,764 --> 00:03:31,431
in mighty power for good,

55
00:03:31,431 --> 00:03:35,098
and his diligence I know,

56
00:03:35,098 --> 00:03:38,118
and his prayers I have heard.

57
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:39,785
8 Yea, his weeping for

58
00:03:39,785 --> 00:03:41,452
Zion I have seen, and I

59
00:03:41,452 --> 00:03:43,119
will cause that he shall

60
00:03:43,119 --> 00:03:44,786
mourn for her no longer;

61
00:03:44,786 --> 00:03:46,453
for his days of

62
00:03:46,453 --> 00:03:48,12
rejoicing are come unto the

63
00:03:48,12 --> 00:03:49,787
remission of his sins, and

64
00:03:49,787 --> 00:03:51,454
the manifestations of my

65
00:03:51,454 --> 00:03:53,6
blessings upon his works.

66
00:03:53,6 --> 00:03:56,062
9 For, behold, I will

67
00:03:56,062 --> 00:03:58,524
bless all those who labor

68
00:03:58,524 --> 00:04:00,986
in my vineyard with a

69
00:04:00,986 --> 00:04:03,448
mighty blessing, and they

70
00:04:03,448 --> 00:04:05,91
shall believe on his

71
00:04:05,91 --> 00:04:08,372
words, which are given him

72
00:04:08,372 --> 00:04:10,834
through me by the

73
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:13,296
Comforter, which manifesteth

74
00:04:13,296 --> 00:04:15,758
that Jesus was crucified

75
00:04:15,758 --> 00:04:18,22
by sinful men for the

76
00:04:18,22 --> 00:04:20,682
sins of the world, yea,

77
00:04:20,682 --> 00:04:23,144
for the remission of sins

78
00:04:23,144 --> 00:04:25,031
unto the contrite heart.

79
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:32,031
10 Wherefore it

80
00:04:32,031 --> 00:04:39,031
behooveth me that he should be

81
00:04:39,031 --> 00:04:46,031
ordained by you,

82
00:04:46,031 --> 00:04:53,36
Oliver Cowdery mine apostle;

83
00:04:53,36 --> 00:04:57,235
11 This being an

84
00:04:57,235 --> 00:05:01,11
ordinance unto you, that

85
00:05:01,11 --> 00:05:04,985
you are an elder

86
00:05:04,985 --> 00:05:08,86
under his hand, he being

87
00:05:08,86 --> 00:05:12,735
the first unto you,

88
00:05:12,735 --> 00:05:16,61
that you might be an

89
00:05:16,61 --> 00:05:20,485
elder unto this church

90
00:05:20,485 --> 00:05:24,791
of Christ, bearing my name—

91
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:28,013
12 And the first

92
00:05:28,013 --> 00:05:31,235
preacher of this

93
00:05:31,235 --> 00:05:34,457
church unto the church,

94
00:05:34,457 --> 00:05:37,679
and before the

95
00:05:37,679 --> 00:05:40,901
world, yea, before the

96
00:05:40,901 --> 00:05:44,123
Gentiles; yea, and

97
00:05:44,123 --> 00:05:47,345
thus saith the

98
00:05:47,345 --> 00:05:50,567
Lord God, lo, lo! to

99
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:53,086
the Jews also. Amen.
