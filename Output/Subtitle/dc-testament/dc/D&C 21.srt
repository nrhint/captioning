00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 21 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Prophet, at Fayette, New York, April 6, 1830. This

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
revelation was given at the organization of the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Church, on the date named, in the home of Peter

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Whitmer Sr. Six men, who had previously been

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
baptized, participated. By unanimous vote these

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
persons expressed their desire and determination to

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
organize, according to the commandment of God (see

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
section 20). They also voted to accept and

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
sustain Joseph Smith Jr. and Oliver Cowdery as the

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
presiding officers of the Church. With the laying on

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of hands, Joseph then ordained Oliver an elder of

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Church, and Oliver similarly ordained

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Joseph. After administration of the sacrament, Joseph

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and Oliver laid hands upon the participants

16
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
individually for the bestowal of the Holy Ghost and for

17
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the confirmation of each as a member of the

18
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Church. 
1–3, Joseph Smith is called to be a seer,

19
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
translator, prophet, apostle, and elder; 
4–8, His

20
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
word will guide the cause of Zion; 
9–12, The

21
00:00:00,0 --> 01:08:55,
Saints will believe his words as he speaks by the Comforter. 

22
01:08:55,0 --> 01:08:55,0
1 Behold, there shall be a record kept among

23
01:08:55,0 --> 01:08:55,0
you; and in it thou shalt be called a seer, a

24
01:08:55,0 --> 01:08:55,0
translator, a prophet, an apostle of Jesus Christ, an

25
01:08:55,0 --> 01:08:55,0
elder of the church through the will of God the

26
01:08:55,0 --> 01:08:27,
Father, and the grace of your Lord Jesus Christ,

27
01:08:27,0 --> 01:08:27,0
2 Being inspired of the Holy Ghost

28
01:08:27,0 --> 01:08:27,0
to lay the foundation thereof, and to

29
01:08:27,0 --> 01:10:39,
build it up unto the most holy faith.

30
01:10:39,0 --> 01:10:39,0
3 Which church was organized and

31
01:10:39,0 --> 01:10:39,0
established in the year of your Lord

32
01:10:39,0 --> 01:10:39,0
eighteen hundred and thirty, in the

33
01:10:39,0 --> 01:10:39,0
fourth month, and on the sixth day

34
01:10:39,0 --> 01:14:52,
of the month which is called April.

35
01:14:52,0 --> 01:14:52,0
4 Wherefore, meaning the church,

36
01:14:52,0 --> 01:14:52,0
thou shalt give heed unto all his

37
01:14:52,0 --> 01:14:52,0
words and commandments which he shall

38
01:14:52,0 --> 01:14:52,0
give unto you as he receiveth them,

39
01:14:52,0 --> 01:25:02,
walking in all holiness before me;

40
01:25:02,0 --> 01:25:02,0
5 For his word ye shall

41
01:25:02,0 --> 01:25:02,0
receive, as if from mine own

42
01:25:02,0 --> 01:31:57,
mouth, in all patience and faith.

43
01:31:57,0 --> 01:31:57,0
6 For by doing these things

44
01:31:57,0 --> 01:31:57,0
the gates of hell shall

45
01:31:57,0 --> 01:31:57,0
not prevail against you; yea,

46
01:31:57,0 --> 01:31:57,0
and the Lord God will

47
01:31:57,0 --> 01:31:57,0
disperse the powers of darkness

48
01:31:57,0 --> 01:31:57,0
from before you, and cause

49
01:31:57,0 --> 01:31:57,0
the heavens to shake for

50
01:31:57,0 --> 01:38:38,
your good, and his name’s glory.

51
01:38:38,0 --> 01:38:38,0
7 For thus saith the Lord

52
01:38:38,0 --> 01:38:38,0
God: Him have I inspired

53
01:38:38,0 --> 01:38:38,0
to move the cause of Zion

54
01:38:38,0 --> 01:38:38,0
in mighty power for good,

55
01:38:38,0 --> 01:38:38,0
and his diligence I know,

56
01:38:38,0 --> 01:48:48,
and his prayers I have heard.

57
01:48:48,0 --> 01:48:48,0
8 Yea, his weeping for

58
01:48:48,0 --> 01:48:48,0
Zion I have seen, and I

59
01:48:48,0 --> 01:48:48,0
will cause that he shall

60
01:48:48,0 --> 01:48:48,0
mourn for her no longer;

61
01:48:48,0 --> 01:48:48,0
for his days of

62
01:48:48,0 --> 01:48:48,0
rejoicing are come unto the

63
01:48:48,0 --> 01:48:48,0
remission of his sins, and

64
01:48:48,0 --> 01:48:48,0
the manifestations of my

65
01:48:48,0 --> 01:56:32,
blessings upon his works.

66
01:56:32,0 --> 01:56:32,0
9 For, behold, I will

67
01:56:32,0 --> 01:56:32,0
bless all those who labor

68
01:56:32,0 --> 01:56:32,0
in my vineyard with a

69
01:56:32,0 --> 01:56:32,0
mighty blessing, and they

70
01:56:32,0 --> 01:56:32,0
shall believe on his

71
01:56:32,0 --> 01:56:32,0
words, which are given him

72
01:56:32,0 --> 01:56:32,0
through me by the

73
01:56:32,0 --> 01:56:32,0
Comforter, which manifesteth

74
01:56:32,0 --> 01:56:32,0
that Jesus was crucified

75
01:56:32,0 --> 01:56:32,0
by sinful men for the

76
01:56:32,0 --> 01:56:32,0
sins of the world, yea,

77
01:56:32,0 --> 01:56:32,0
for the remission of sins

78
01:56:32,0 --> 02:12:28,
unto the contrite heart.

79
02:12:28,0 --> 02:12:28,0
10 Wherefore it

80
02:12:28,0 --> 02:12:28,0
behooveth me that he should be

81
02:12:28,0 --> 02:12:28,0
ordained by you,

82
02:12:28,0 --> 02:26:37,
Oliver Cowdery mine apostle;

83
02:26:37,0 --> 02:26:37,0
11 This being an

84
02:26:37,0 --> 02:26:37,0
ordinance unto you, that

85
02:26:37,0 --> 02:26:37,0
you are an elder

86
02:26:37,0 --> 02:26:37,0
under his hand, he being

87
02:26:37,0 --> 02:26:37,0
the first unto you,

88
02:26:37,0 --> 02:26:37,0
that you might be an

89
02:26:37,0 --> 02:26:37,0
elder unto this church

90
02:26:37,0 --> 02:36:47,
of Christ, bearing my name—

91
02:36:47,0 --> 02:36:47,0
12 And the first

92
02:36:47,0 --> 02:36:47,0
preacher of this

93
02:36:47,0 --> 02:36:47,0
church unto the church,

94
02:36:47,0 --> 02:36:47,0
and before the

95
02:36:47,0 --> 02:36:47,0
world, yea, before the

96
02:36:47,0 --> 02:36:47,0
Gentiles; yea, and

97
02:36:47,0 --> 02:36:47,0
thus saith the

98
02:36:47,0 --> 02:36:47,0
Lord God, lo, lo! to

99
02:36:47,0 --> 02:37:59,
the Jews also. Amen.
