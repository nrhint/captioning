00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:16,745
Section 13 An extract from Joseph Smith’s history

2
00:00:16,745 --> 00:00:22,212
 recounting the ordination of the Prophet and

3
00:00:22,212 --> 00:00:27,679
 Oliver Cowdery to the Aaronic Priesthood near Harmony,

4
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:33,146
 Pennsylvania, May 15, 1829. The ordination was

5
00:00:33,146 --> 00:00:38,613
 done by the hands of an angel who announced himself

6
00:00:38,613 --> 00:00:44,08
 as John, the same that is called John the Baptist

7
00:00:44,08 --> 00:00:49,547
 in the New Testament. The angel explained that he

8
00:00:49,547 --> 00:00:55,014
 was acting under the direction of Peter, James, and

9
00:00:55,014 --> 00:01:00,481
 John, the ancient Apostles, who held the keys of

10
00:01:00,481 --> 00:01:05,948
 the higher priesthood, which was called the

11
00:01:05,948 --> 00:01:11,415
 Priesthood of Melchizedek. The promise was given to

12
00:01:11,415 --> 00:01:16,882
 Joseph and Oliver that in due time this higher

13
00:01:16,882 --> 00:01:22,349
 priesthood would be conferred upon them. (See 
section

14
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:27,816
 27:7–8, 12.) The keys and powers of the Aaronic

15
00:01:27,816 --> 00:01:33,283
 Priesthood are set forth.

16
00:01:33,26 --> 00:01:34,26
1 Upon you my fellow servants, in the name of

17
00:01:34,26 --> 00:01:35,26
 Messiah I confer the Priesthood of Aaron, which holds

18
00:01:35,26 --> 00:01:36,26
 the keys of the ministering of angels, and of the

19
00:01:36,26 --> 00:01:37,26
 gospel of repentance, and of baptism by immersion

20
00:01:37,26 --> 00:01:38,26
 for the remission of sins; and this shall never be

21
00:01:38,26 --> 00:01:39,26
 taken again from the earth, until the sons of

22
00:01:39,26 --> 00:01:40,26
 Levi do offer again an offering unto the Lord in

23
00:01:40,26 --> 00:01:41,26
 righteousness.
