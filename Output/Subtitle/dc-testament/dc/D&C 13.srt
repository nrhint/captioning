Section 13 An extract from Joseph Smith’s

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
history recounting the ordination of the Prophet and

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Oliver Cowdery to the Aaronic Priesthood near

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Harmony, Pennsylvania, May 15, 1829. The ordination

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
was done by the hands of an angel who announced

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
himself as John, the same that is called John

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Baptist in the New Testament. The angel

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
explained that he was acting under the direction of

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Peter, James, and John, the ancient Apostles, who

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
held the keys of the higher priesthood, which

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
was called the Priesthood of Melchizedek. The

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
promise was given to Joseph and Oliver that in due

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
time this higher priesthood would be conferred

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
upon them. (See 
section 27:7–8, 12.) The keys

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:46:01,
and powers of the Aaronic Priesthood are set forth. 

16
00:46:01,0 --> 00:46:01,0
1 Upon you my fellow servants, in the name of

17
00:46:01,0 --> 00:46:01,0
Messiah I confer the Priesthood of Aaron,

18
00:46:01,0 --> 00:46:01,0
which holds the keys of the ministering of

19
00:46:01,0 --> 00:46:01,0
angels, and of the gospel of repentance, and of

20
00:46:01,0 --> 00:46:01,0
baptism by immersion for the remission of

21
00:46:01,0 --> 00:46:01,0
sins; and this shall never be taken again from

22
00:46:01,0 --> 00:46:01,0
the earth, until the sons of Levi do offer

23
00:46:01,0 --> 00:58:42,
again an offering unto the Lord in righteousness.
