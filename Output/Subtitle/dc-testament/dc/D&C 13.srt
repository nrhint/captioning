Section 13 An extract from Joseph Smith’s

2
00:00:06,133 --> 00:00:12,266
history recounting the ordination of the Prophet and

3
00:00:12,266 --> 00:00:18,399
Oliver Cowdery to the Aaronic Priesthood near

4
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:24,532
Harmony, Pennsylvania, May 15, 1829. The ordination

5
00:00:24,532 --> 00:00:30,665
was done by the hands of an angel who announced

6
00:00:30,665 --> 00:00:36,798
himself as John, the same that is called John

7
00:00:36,798 --> 00:00:42,931
the Baptist in the New Testament. The angel

8
00:00:42,931 --> 00:00:49,064
explained that he was acting under the direction of

9
00:00:49,064 --> 00:00:55,197
Peter, James, and John, the ancient Apostles, who

10
00:00:55,197 --> 00:01:01,33
held the keys of the higher priesthood, which

11
00:01:01,33 --> 00:01:07,463
was called the Priesthood of Melchizedek. The

12
00:01:07,463 --> 00:01:13,596
promise was given to Joseph and Oliver that in due

13
00:01:13,596 --> 00:01:19,729
time this higher priesthood would be conferred

14
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:25,862
upon them. (See 
section 27:7–8, 12.) The keys

15
00:01:25,862 --> 00:01:32,125
and powers of the Aaronic Priesthood are set forth. 

16
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,75
1 Upon you my fellow servants, in the name of

17
00:01:34,75 --> 00:01:37,375
Messiah I confer the Priesthood of Aaron,

18
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:40,0
which holds the keys of the ministering of

19
00:01:40,0 --> 00:01:42,625
angels, and of the gospel of repentance, and of

20
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:45,25
baptism by immersion for the remission of

21
00:01:45,25 --> 00:01:47,875
sins; and this shall never be taken again from

22
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:50,5
the earth, until the sons of Levi do offer

23
00:01:50,5 --> 00:01:53,447
again an offering unto the Lord in righteousness.
