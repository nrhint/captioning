00:00:18,535 --> 00:00:26,66
Section 119 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:26,66 --> 00:00:34,785
 the Prophet, at Far West, Missouri, July 8, 1838,

3
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:42,91
 in answer to his supplication: “O Lord! Show unto

4
00:00:42,91 --> 00:00:51,035
 thy servants how much thou requirest of the

5
00:00:51,035 --> 00:00:59,16
 properties of thy people for a tithing.” The law of

6
00:00:59,16 --> 00:01:07,285
 tithing, as understood today, had not been given to

7
00:01:07,285 --> 00:01:15,41
 the Church previous to this revelation. The term

8
00:01:15,41 --> 00:01:23,535
 tithing in the prayer just quoted and in previous

9
00:01:23,535 --> 00:01:31,66
 revelations (
64:23; 
85:3; 
97:11) had meant not

10
00:01:31,66 --> 00:01:39,785
 just one-tenth, but all free-will offerings, or

11
00:01:39,785 --> 00:01:47,91
 contributions, to the Church funds. The Lord had

12
00:01:47,91 --> 00:01:56,035
 previously given to the Church the law of consecration

13
00:01:56,035 --> 00:02:04,16
 and stewardship of property, which members (chiefly

14
00:02:04,16 --> 00:02:12,285
 the leading elders) entered into by a covenant

15
00:02:12,285 --> 00:02:20,41
 that was to be everlasting. Because of failure on

16
00:02:20,41 --> 00:02:28,535
 the part of many to abide by this covenant, the Lord

17
00:02:28,535 --> 00:02:36,66
 withdrew it for a time and gave instead the law

18
00:02:36,66 --> 00:02:44,785
 of tithing to the whole Church. The Prophet asked

19
00:02:44,785 --> 00:02:52,91
 the Lord how much of their property He required for

20
00:02:52,91 --> 00:03:01,035
 sacred purposes. The answer was this revelation.

21
00:03:01,035 --> 00:03:09,16
1–5, The Saints are to pay their surplus property

22
00:03:09,16 --> 00:03:17,285
 and then give, as tithing, one-tenth of their

23
00:03:17,285 --> 00:03:25,41
 interest annually; 
6–7, Such a course will sanctify

24
00:03:25,41 --> 00:03:33,535
 the land of Zion.

25
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:37,547
1 Verily, thus saith the Lord, I require all their

26
00:03:37,547 --> 00:03:41,547
 surplus property to be put into the hands of the

27
00:03:41,547 --> 00:03:45,547
 bishop of my church in Zion

28
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:49,609
2 For the building of mine house, and for the

29
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:53,359
 laying of the foundation of Zion and for the

30
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:57,109
 priesthood, and for the debts of the Presidency of my

31
00:03:57,109 --> 00:04:00,859
 Church

32
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:05,374
3 And this shall be the beginning of the tithing

33
00:04:05,374 --> 00:04:09,874
 of my people

34
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:15,199
4 And after that, those who have thus been tithed

35
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:21,199
 shall pay one-tenth of all their interest

36
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:27,199
 annually; and this shall be a standing law unto them

37
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:33,199
 forever, for my holy priesthood, saith the Lord

38
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:38,773
5 Verily I say unto you, it shall come to pass

39
00:04:38,773 --> 00:04:44,373
 that all those who gather unto the land of Zion shall

40
00:04:44,373 --> 00:04:49,973
 be tithed of their surplus properties, and shall

41
00:04:49,973 --> 00:04:55,573
 observe this law, or they shall not be found

42
00:04:55,573 --> 00:05:01,173
 worthy to abide among you

43
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:08,534
6 And I say unto you, if my people observe not

44
00:05:08,534 --> 00:05:15,367
 this law, to keep it holy, and by this law sanctify

45
00:05:15,367 --> 00:05:22,2
 the land of Zion unto me, that my statutes and my

46
00:05:22,2 --> 00:05:29,033
 judgments may be kept thereon, that it may be most

47
00:05:29,033 --> 00:05:35,866
 holy, behold, verily I say unto you, it shall not

48
00:05:35,866 --> 00:05:42,699
 be a land of Zion unto you

49
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:48,209
7 And this shall be an ensample unto all the

50
00:05:48,209 --> 00:05:54,209
 stakes of Zion. Even so. Amen.
