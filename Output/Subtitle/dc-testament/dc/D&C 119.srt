00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 119 Revelation given through Joseph

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Smith the Prophet, at Far West, Missouri, July 8,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
1838, in answer to his supplication: “O Lord! Show

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
unto thy servants how much thou requirest of

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the properties of thy people for a tithing.” The

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
law of tithing, as understood today, had not been

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
given to the Church previous to this

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
revelation. The term tithing in the prayer just quoted and

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
in previous revelations (
64:23; 
85:3; 
97:11)

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
had meant not just one-tenth, but all free-will

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
offerings, or contributions, to the Church

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
funds. The Lord had previously given to the Church

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the law of consecration and stewardship of

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
property, which members (chiefly the leading elders)

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
entered into by a covenant that was to be

16
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
everlasting. Because of failure on the part of many to

17
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
abide by this covenant, the Lord withdrew it for

18
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
a time and gave instead the law of tithing to

19
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the whole Church. The Prophet asked the Lord how

20
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
much of their property He required for sacred

21
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
purposes. The answer was this revelation. 
1–5,

22
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
The Saints are to pay their surplus property and

23
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
then give, as tithing, one-tenth of their

24
00:00:00,0 --> 03:32:39,
interest annually; 
6–7, Such a course will sanctify the land of Zion. 

25
03:32:39,0 --> 03:32:39,0
1 Verily, thus saith the Lord, I require

26
03:32:39,0 --> 03:32:39,0
all their surplus property to be put into

27
03:32:39,0 --> 03:36:46,
the hands of the bishop of my church in Zion,

28
03:36:46,0 --> 03:36:46,0
2 For the building of mine house, and

29
03:36:46,0 --> 03:36:46,0
for the laying of the foundation of

30
03:36:46,0 --> 03:36:46,0
Zion and for the priesthood, and for the

31
03:36:46,0 --> 03:43:49,
debts of the Presidency of my Church.

32
03:43:49,0 --> 03:43:49,0
3 And this shall be the

33
03:43:49,0 --> 03:39:29,
beginning of the tithing of my people.

34
03:39:29,0 --> 03:39:29,0
4 And after that, those who

35
03:39:29,0 --> 03:39:29,0
have thus been tithed

36
03:39:29,0 --> 03:39:29,0
shall pay one-tenth of all

37
03:39:29,0 --> 03:39:29,0
their interest annually; and

38
03:39:29,0 --> 03:39:29,0
this shall be a standing law

39
03:39:29,0 --> 03:39:29,0
unto them forever, for my

40
03:39:29,0 --> 03:44:34,
holy priesthood, saith the Lord.

41
03:44:34,0 --> 03:44:34,0
5 Verily I say unto you,

42
03:44:34,0 --> 03:44:34,0
it shall come to pass

43
03:44:34,0 --> 03:44:34,0
that all those who gather

44
03:44:34,0 --> 03:44:34,0
unto the land of Zion

45
03:44:34,0 --> 03:44:34,0
shall be tithed of their

46
03:44:34,0 --> 03:44:34,0
surplus properties, and

47
03:44:34,0 --> 03:44:34,0
shall observe this law,

48
03:44:34,0 --> 03:44:34,0
or they shall not be

49
03:44:34,0 --> 03:49:39,
found worthy to abide among you.

50
03:49:39,0 --> 03:49:39,0
6 And I say unto you,

51
03:49:39,0 --> 03:49:39,0
if my people observe not

52
03:49:39,0 --> 03:49:39,0
this law, to keep it

53
03:49:39,0 --> 03:49:39,0
holy, and by this law

54
03:49:39,0 --> 03:49:39,0
sanctify the land of Zion

55
03:49:39,0 --> 03:49:39,0
unto me, that my

56
03:49:39,0 --> 03:49:39,0
statutes and my judgments

57
03:49:39,0 --> 03:49:39,0
may be kept thereon, that

58
03:49:39,0 --> 03:49:39,0
it may be most holy,

59
03:49:39,0 --> 03:49:39,0
behold, verily I say

60
03:49:39,0 --> 03:49:39,0
unto you, it shall not be

61
03:49:39,0 --> 04:00:11,
a land of Zion unto you.

62
04:00:11,0 --> 04:00:11,0
7 And this shall be

63
04:00:11,0 --> 04:00:11,0
an ensample unto

64
04:00:11,0 --> 04:00:11,0
all the stakes of

65
04:00:11,0 --> 04:07:14,
Zion. Even so. Amen.
