Smith the Prophet, at Far West, Missouri, July 8,

00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
1838, in response to the supplication, “Show us

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0

7
01:01:58,0 --> 01:01:58,0
1 Verily, thus saith the Lord: Let a

8
01:01:58,0 --> 01:01:58,0
conference be held immediately; let the

9
01:01:58,0 --> 01:01:58,0
Twelve be organized; and let men be appointed

10
01:01:58,0 --> 01:13:35,

01:09:15,0 --> 01:09:15,0

and if they will do this

17
01:09:15,0 --> 01:09:15,0
in all lowliness of heart,

18
01:09:15,0 --> 01:09:15,0
in meekness and humility,

19
01:09:15,0 --> 01:09:15,0
and long-suffering, I,

20
01:09:15,0 --> 01:09:15,0
the Lord, give unto them a

21
01:09:15,0 --> 01:09:15,0
promise that I will provide

22
01:09:15,0 --> 01:09:15,0

23
01:09:15,0 --> 01:09:15,0
an effectual door shall be

24
