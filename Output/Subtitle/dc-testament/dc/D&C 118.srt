Section 118 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:19,778 --> 00:00:28,278
 the Prophet, at Far West, Missouri, July 8, 1838,

3
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:36,778
 in response to the supplication, “Show us thy

4
00:00:36,778 --> 00:00:45,278
 will, O Lord, concerning the Twelve.” 
1–3, The Lord

5
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:53,778
 will provide for the families of the Twelve; 
4–6,

6
00:00:53,778 --> 00:01:02,278
 Vacancies in the Twelve are filled.

7
00:01:02,946 --> 00:01:08,196
1 Verily, thus saith the Lord: Let a conference be

8
00:01:08,196 --> 00:01:13,446
 held immediately; let the Twelve be organized;

9
00:01:13,446 --> 00:01:18,696
 and let men be appointed to supply the place of

10
00:01:18,696 --> 00:01:23,946
 those who are fallen

11
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:30,451
2 Let my servant Thomas remain for a season in the

12
00:01:30,451 --> 00:01:36,951
 land of Zion, to publish my word

13
00:01:36,73 --> 00:01:42,563
3 Let the residue continue to preach from that

14
00:01:42,563 --> 00:01:48,396
 hour, and if they will do this in all lowliness of

15
00:01:48,396 --> 00:01:54,229
 heart, in meekness and humility, and long-suffering,

16
00:01:54,229 --> 00:02:00,062
 I, the Lord, give unto them a promise that I will

17
00:02:00,062 --> 00:02:05,895
 provide for their families; and an effectual door

18
00:02:05,895 --> 00:02:11,728
 shall be opened for them, from henceforth

19
00:02:11,481 --> 00:02:17,481
4 And next spring let them depart to go over the

20
00:02:17,481 --> 00:02:23,481
 great waters, and there promulgate my gospel, the

21
00:02:23,481 --> 00:02:29,481
 fulness thereof, and bear record of my name

22
00:02:29,0 --> 00:02:36,0
5 Let them take leave of my saints in the city of

23
00:02:36,0 --> 00:02:43,0
 Far West, on the twenty-sixth day of April next,

24
00:02:43,0 --> 00:02:50,0
 on the building-spot of my house, saith the Lord

25
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:56,703
6 Let my servant John Taylor, and also my servant

26
00:02:56,703 --> 00:03:03,103
 John E. Page, and also my servant Wilford

27
00:03:03,103 --> 00:03:09,503
 Woodruff, and also my servant Willard Richards, be

28
00:03:09,503 --> 00:03:15,903
 appointed to fill the places of those who have fallen,

29
00:03:15,903 --> 00:03:22,303
 and be officially notified of their appointment.
