 the Prophet to Oliver Cowdery, at Harmony,

00:00:23,582 --> 00:00:30,218
 Pennsylvania, April 1829. In the course of the translation

4
00:00:30,218 --> 00:00:36,854
 of the Book of Mormon, Oliver, who continued to

5
00:00:36,854 --> 00:00:43,49
 serve as scribe, writing at the Prophet’s dictation,

6
00:00:43,49 --> 00:00:50,126
 desired to be endowed with the gift of

7
00:00:50,126 --> 00:00:56,762
 translation. The Lord responded to his supplication by

8
00:00:56,762 --> 00:01:03,398
 granting this revelation. 
1–5, Revelation comes by the

9
00:01:03,398 --> 00:01:10,034
 power of the Holy Ghost; 
6–12, Knowledge of the

10
00:01:10,034 --> 00:01:16,67
 mysteries of God and the power to translate

11
00:01:16,67 --> 00:01:23,306
 ancient records come by faith.

12
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:29,85
1 Oliver Cowdery, verily, verily, I say unto you,

13
00:01:29,85 --> 00:01:36,183
 that assuredly as the Lord liveth, who is your God

14
00:01:36,183 --> 00:01:42,516
 and your Redeemer, even so surely shall you

15
00:01:42,516 --> 00:01:48,849
 receive a knowledge of whatsoever things you shall ask

16
00:01:48,849 --> 00:01:55,182
 in faith, with an honest heart, believing that you

17
00:01:55,182 --> 00:02:01,515
 shall receive a knowledge concerning the

18
00:02:01,515 --> 00:02:07,848
 engravings of old records, which are ancient, which

19
00:02:07,848 --> 00:02:14,181
 contain those parts of my scripture of which has been

20
00:02:14,181 --> 00:02:20,514
 spoken by the manifestation of my Spirit

21
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:26,207
2 Yea, behold, I will tell you in your mind and in

22
00:02:26,207 --> 00:02:32,207
 your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall come

23
00:02:32,207 --> 00:02:38,207
 upon you and which shall dwell in your heart

24
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:46,892
3 Now, behold, this is the spirit of revelation;

25
00:02:46,892 --> 00:02:54,892
 behold, this is the spirit by which Moses brought

26
00:02:54,892 --> 00:03:02,892
 the children of Israel through the Red Sea on dry

27
00:03:02,892 --> 00:03:10,892
 ground

28
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:18,157
4 Therefore this is thy gift; apply unto it, and

29
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:25,757
 blessed art thou, for it shall deliver you out of

30
00:03:25,757 --> 00:03:33,357
 the hands of your enemies, when, if it were not so,

31
00:03:33,357 --> 00:03:40,957
 they would slay you and bring your soul to

32
00:03:40,957 --> 00:03:48,557
 destruction

33
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:56,995
5 Oh, remember these words, and keep my

34
00:03:56,995 --> 00:04:04,995
 commandments. Remember, this is your gift

35
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:12,044
6 Now this is not all thy gift; for you have

36
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:19,377
 another gift, which is the gift of Aaron; behold, it

37
00:04:19,377 --> 00:04:26,71
 has told you many things

38
00:04:26,5 --> 00:04:30,833
7 Behold, there is no other power, save the power

39
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:35,166
 of God, that can cause this gift of Aaron to be

40
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:39,499
 with you

41
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:46,346
8 Therefore, doubt not, for it is the gift of God;

42
00:04:46,346 --> 00:04:52,946
 and you shall hold it in your hands, and do

43
00:04:52,946 --> 00:04:59,546
 marvelous works; and no power shall be able to take it

44
00:04:59,546 --> 00:05:06,146
 away out of your hands, for it is the work of God

45
00:05:06,146 --> 00:05:12,746


46
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:18,012
9 And, therefore, whatsoever you shall ask me to

47
00:05:18,012 --> 00:05:23,679
 tell you by that means, that will I grant unto you,

48
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:29,346
 and you shall have knowledge concerning it

49
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:38,896
10 Remember that without faith you can do nothing;

50
00:05:38,896 --> 00:05:47,896
 therefore ask in faith. Trifle not with these

51
00:05:47,896 --> 00:05:56,896
 things; do not ask for that which you ought not

52
00:05:56,857 --> 00:06:04,057
11 Ask that you may know the mysteries of God, and

53
00:06:04,057 --> 00:06:11,257
 that you may translate and receive knowledge from

54
00:06:11,257 --> 00:06:18,457
 all those ancient records which have been hid up,

55
00:06:18,457 --> 00:06:25,657
 that are sacred; and according to your faith

56
00:06:25,657 --> 00:06:32,857
 shall it be done unto you

57
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:34,959
12 Behold, it is I that have spoken it; and I am

58
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:37,626
 the same that spake unto you from the beginning.

59
00:06:37,626 --> 00:06:40,293
 Amen.
