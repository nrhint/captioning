00:00:10,31 --> 00:00:18,421
Section 8 Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet to 

2
00:00:18,421 --> 00:00:26,533
Oliver Cowdery, at Harmony, Pennsylvania, April 1829. In the course 

3
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:34,644
of the translation of the Book of Mormon, Oliver, who 

4
00:00:34,644 --> 00:00:42,755
continued to serve as scribe, writing at the Prophet’s dictation, 

5
00:00:42,755 --> 00:00:50,866
desired to be endowed with the gift of translation. The 

6
00:00:50,866 --> 00:00:58,977
Lord responded to his supplication by granting this revelation. 
1–5, 

7
00:00:58,977 --> 00:01:07,088
Revelation comes by the power of the Holy Ghost; 
6–12, 

8
00:01:07,088 --> 00:01:15,199
Knowledge of the mysteries of God and the power to 

9
00:01:15,199 --> 00:01:23,31
translate ancient records come by faith.  

10
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:30,642
1 Oliver Cowdery, verily, verily, I say unto you, that 

11
00:01:30,642 --> 00:01:37,767
assuredly as the Lord liveth, who is your God and 

12
00:01:37,767 --> 00:01:44,892
your Redeemer, even so surely shall you receive a knowledge 

13
00:01:44,892 --> 00:01:52,017
of whatsoever things you shall ask in faith, with an 

14
00:01:52,017 --> 00:01:59,142
honest heart, believing that you shall receive a knowledge concerning 

15
00:01:59,142 --> 00:02:06,267
the engravings of old records, which are ancient, which contain 

16
00:02:06,267 --> 00:02:13,392
those parts of my scripture of which has been spoken 

17
00:02:13,392 --> 00:02:20,517
by the manifestation of my Spirit. 

18
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:26,207
2 Yea, behold, I will tell you in your mind 

19
00:02:26,207 --> 00:02:32,207
and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall 

20
00:02:32,207 --> 00:02:38,207
come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart. 

21
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:49,559
3 Now, behold, this is the spirit of revelation; behold, 

22
00:02:49,559 --> 00:03:00,225
this is the spirit by which Moses brought the children 

23
00:03:00,225 --> 00:03:10,892
of Israel through the Red Sea on dry ground. 

24
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:18,157
4 Therefore this is thy gift; apply unto it, and 

25
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:25,757
blessed art thou, for it shall deliver you out of 

26
00:03:25,757 --> 00:03:33,357
the hands of your enemies, when, if it were not 

27
00:03:33,357 --> 00:03:40,957
so, they would slay you and bring your soul to 

28
00:03:40,957 --> 00:03:48,557
destruction. 

29
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:56,995
5 Oh, remember these words, and keep my commandments. Remember, 

30
00:03:56,995 --> 00:04:04,995
this is your gift. 

31
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:12,044
6 Now this is not all thy gift; for you 

32
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:19,378
have another gift, which is the gift of Aaron; behold, 

33
00:04:19,378 --> 00:04:26,711
it has told you many things; 

34
00:04:26,5 --> 00:04:30,833
7 Behold, there is no other power, save the power 

35
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:35,166
of God, that can cause this gift of Aaron to 

36
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:39,5
be with you. 

37
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:46,346
8 Therefore, doubt not, for it is the gift of 

38
00:04:46,346 --> 00:04:52,946
God; and you shall hold it in your hands, and 

39
00:04:52,946 --> 00:04:59,546
do marvelous works; and no power shall be able to 

40
00:04:59,546 --> 00:05:06,146
take it away out of your hands, for it is 

41
00:05:06,146 --> 00:05:12,746
the work of God. 

42
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:18,012
9 And, therefore, whatsoever you shall ask me to tell 

43
00:05:18,012 --> 00:05:23,679
you by that means, that will I grant unto you, 

44
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:29,345
and you shall have knowledge concerning it. 

45
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:38,896
10 Remember that without faith you can do nothing; therefore 

46
00:05:38,896 --> 00:05:47,896
ask in faith. Trifle not with these things; do not 

47
00:05:47,896 --> 00:05:56,896
ask for that which you ought not. 

48
00:05:56,857 --> 00:06:04,057
11 Ask that you may know the mysteries of God, 

49
00:06:04,057 --> 00:06:11,257
and that you may translate and receive knowledge from all 

50
00:06:11,257 --> 00:06:18,457
those ancient records which have been hid up, that are 

51
00:06:18,457 --> 00:06:25,657
sacred; and according to your faith shall it be done 

52
00:06:25,657 --> 00:06:32,857
unto you. 

53
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:34,959
12 Behold, it is I that have spoken it; and 

54
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:37,625
I am the same that spake unto you from the 

55
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:40,292
beginning. Amen.
