00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:18,655
Section 8 Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet to 

2
00:00:18,655 --> 00:00:26,766
Oliver Cowdery, at Harmony, Pennsylvania, April 1829. In the course 

3
00:00:26,766 --> 00:00:34,877
of the translation of the Book of Mormon, Oliver, who 

4
00:00:34,877 --> 00:00:42,988
continued to serve as scribe, writing at the Prophet’s dictation, 

5
00:00:42,988 --> 00:00:51,099
desired to be endowed with the gift of translation. The 

6
00:00:51,099 --> 00:00:59,211
Lord responded to his supplication by granting this revelation. 
1–5, 

7
00:00:59,211 --> 00:01:07,322
Revelation comes by the power of the Holy Ghost; 
6–12, 

8
00:01:07,322 --> 00:01:15,433
Knowledge of the mysteries of God and the power to 

9
00:01:15,433 --> 00:01:23,544
translate ancient records come by faith.  

10
00:01:23,75 --> 00:01:30,875
1 Oliver Cowdery, verily, verily, I say unto you, that 

11
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:38,0
assuredly as the Lord liveth, who is your God and 

12
00:01:38,0 --> 00:01:45,125
your Redeemer, even so surely shall you receive a knowledge 

13
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:52,25
of whatsoever things you shall ask in faith, with an 

14
00:01:52,25 --> 00:01:59,375
honest heart, believing that you shall receive a knowledge concerning 

15
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:06,5
the engravings of old records, which are ancient, which contain 

16
00:02:06,5 --> 00:02:13,625
those parts of my scripture of which has been spoken 

17
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:20,75
by the manifestation of my Spirit. 

18
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:26,173
2 Yea, behold, I will tell you in your mind 

19
00:02:26,173 --> 00:02:32,173
and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which shall 

20
00:02:32,173 --> 00:02:38,173
come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart. 

21
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:49,359
3 Now, behold, this is the spirit of revelation; behold, 

22
00:02:49,359 --> 00:03:00,025
this is the spirit by which Moses brought the children 

23
00:03:00,025 --> 00:03:10,692
of Israel through the Red Sea on dry ground. 

24
00:03:10,59 --> 00:03:18,39
4 Therefore this is thy gift; apply unto it, and 

25
00:03:18,39 --> 00:03:26,19
blessed art thou, for it shall deliver you out of 

26
00:03:26,19 --> 00:03:33,99
the hands of your enemies, when, if it were not 

27
00:03:33,99 --> 00:03:41,79
so, they would slay you and bring your soul to 

28
00:03:41,79 --> 00:03:49,59
destruction. 

29
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:56,529
5 Oh, remember these words, and keep my commandments. Remember, 

30
00:03:56,529 --> 00:04:04,029
this is your gift. 

31
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:12,178
6 Now this is not all thy gift; for you 

32
00:04:12,178 --> 00:04:19,844
have another gift, which is the gift of Aaron; behold, 

33
00:04:19,844 --> 00:04:27,511
it has told you many things; 

34
00:04:27,1 --> 00:04:31,1
7 Behold, there is no other power, save the power 

35
00:04:31,1 --> 00:04:35,1
of God, that can cause this gift of Aaron to 

36
00:04:35,1 --> 00:04:39,1
be with you. 

37
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:46,346
8 Therefore, doubt not, for it is the gift of 

38
00:04:46,346 --> 00:04:52,946
God; and you shall hold it in your hands, and 

39
00:04:52,946 --> 00:04:59,546
do marvelous works; and no power shall be able to 

40
00:04:59,546 --> 00:05:06,146
take it away out of your hands, for it is 

41
00:05:06,146 --> 00:05:12,746
the work of God. 

42
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:18,012
9 And, therefore, whatsoever you shall ask me to tell 

43
00:05:18,012 --> 00:05:23,679
you by that means, that will I grant unto you, 

44
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:29,345
and you shall have knowledge concerning it. 

45
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:38,896
10 Remember that without faith you can do nothing; therefore 

46
00:05:38,896 --> 00:05:47,896
ask in faith. Trifle not with these things; do not 

47
00:05:47,896 --> 00:05:56,896
ask for that which you ought not. 

48
00:05:56,857 --> 00:06:04,057
11 Ask that you may know the mysteries of God, 

49
00:06:04,057 --> 00:06:11,257
and that you may translate and receive knowledge from all 

50
00:06:11,257 --> 00:06:18,457
those ancient records which have been hid up, that are 

51
00:06:18,457 --> 00:06:25,657
sacred; and according to your faith shall it be done 

52
00:06:25,657 --> 00:06:32,857
unto you. 

53
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:41,292
12 Behold, it is I that have spoken it; and 

54
00:06:41,292 --> 00:06:50,292
I am the same that spake unto you from the 

55
00:06:50,292 --> 00:06:59,292
beginning. Amen.
