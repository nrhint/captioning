Section 8 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Prophet to Oliver Cowdery, at Harmony,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Pennsylvania, April 1829. In the course of the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
translation of the Book of Mormon, Oliver, who

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
continued to serve as scribe, writing at the

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Prophet’s dictation, desired to be endowed with the

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
gift of translation. The Lord responded to his

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
supplication by granting this revelation. 
1–5,

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Revelation comes by the power of the Holy

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Ghost; 
6–12, Knowledge of the mysteries of God and

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:41:02,
the power to translate ancient records come by faith. 

12
00:41:02,0 --> 00:41:02,0
1 Oliver Cowdery, verily, verily, I say

13
00:41:02,0 --> 00:41:02,0
unto you, that assuredly as the Lord liveth,

14
00:41:02,0 --> 00:41:02,0
who is your God and your Redeemer, even so

15
00:41:02,0 --> 00:41:02,0
surely shall you receive a knowledge of

16
00:41:02,0 --> 00:41:02,0
whatsoever things you shall ask in faith, with

17
00:41:02,0 --> 00:41:02,0
an honest heart, believing that you shall

18
00:41:02,0 --> 00:41:02,0
receive a knowledge concerning the

19
00:41:02,0 --> 00:41:02,0
engravings of old records, which are ancient, which

20
00:41:02,0 --> 00:41:02,0
contain those parts of my scripture of

21
00:41:02,0 --> 00:56:08,
which has been spoken by the manifestation of my Spirit.

22
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
2 Yea, behold, I will tell you in

23
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
your mind and in your heart, by the

24
00:56:08,0 --> 00:56:08,0
Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you

25
00:56:08,0 --> 01:08:49,
and which shall dwell in your heart.

26
01:08:49,0 --> 01:08:49,0
3 Now, behold, this is the

27
01:08:49,0 --> 01:08:49,0
spirit of revelation; behold, this

28
01:08:49,0 --> 01:08:49,0
is the spirit by which Moses

29
01:08:49,0 --> 01:08:49,0
brought the children of Israel

30
01:08:49,0 --> 01:18:59,
through the Red Sea on dry ground.

31
01:18:59,0 --> 01:18:59,0
4 Therefore this is thy gift;

32
01:18:59,0 --> 01:18:59,0
apply unto it, and blessed

33
01:18:59,0 --> 01:18:59,0
art thou, for it shall deliver

34
01:18:59,0 --> 01:18:59,0
you out of the hands of your

35
01:18:59,0 --> 01:18:59,0
enemies, when, if it were

36
01:18:59,0 --> 01:18:59,0
not so, they would slay you and

37
01:18:59,0 --> 01:34:55,
bring your soul to destruction.

38
01:34:55,0 --> 01:34:55,0
5 Oh, remember these words,

39
01:34:55,0 --> 01:34:55,0
and keep my commandments.

40
01:34:55,0 --> 01:54:22,
Remember, this is your gift.

41
01:54:22,0 --> 01:54:22,0
6 Now this is not all

42
01:54:22,0 --> 01:54:22,0
thy gift; for you have

43
01:54:22,0 --> 01:54:22,0
another gift, which is the

44
01:54:22,0 --> 01:54:22,0
gift of Aaron; behold,

45
01:54:22,0 --> 02:01:52,
it has told you many things;

46
02:01:52,0 --> 02:01:52,0
7 Behold, there is no

47
02:01:52,0 --> 02:01:52,0
other power, save

48
02:01:52,0 --> 02:01:52,0
the power of God, that

49
02:01:52,0 --> 02:01:52,0
can cause this gift

50
02:01:52,0 --> 02:12:46,
of Aaron to be with you.

51
02:12:46,0 --> 02:12:46,0
8 Therefore, doubt

52
02:12:46,0 --> 02:12:46,0
not, for it is the

53
02:12:46,0 --> 02:12:46,0
gift of God; and you

54
02:12:46,0 --> 02:12:46,0
shall hold it in your

55
02:12:46,0 --> 02:12:46,0
hands, and do

56
02:12:46,0 --> 02:12:46,0
marvelous works; and no

57
02:12:46,0 --> 02:12:46,0
power shall be able

58
02:12:46,0 --> 02:12:46,0
to take it away out

59
02:12:46,0 --> 02:12:46,0
of your hands, for it

60
02:12:46,0 --> 02:19:27,
is the work of God.

61
02:19:27,0 --> 02:19:27,0
9 And, therefore,

62
02:19:27,0 --> 02:19:27,0
whatsoever you

63
02:19:27,0 --> 02:19:27,0
shall ask me to tell

64
02:19:27,0 --> 02:19:27,0
you by that means,

65
02:19:27,0 --> 02:19:27,0
that will I grant

66
02:19:27,0 --> 02:19:27,0
unto you, and you

67
02:19:27,0 --> 02:19:27,0
shall have

68
02:19:27,0 --> 02:35:37,
knowledge concerning it.

69
02:35:37,0 --> 02:35:37,0
10 Remember that

70
02:35:37,0 --> 02:35:37,0
without faith

71
02:35:37,0 --> 02:35:37,0
you can do

72
02:35:37,0 --> 02:35:37,0
nothing; therefore ask

73
02:35:37,0 --> 02:35:37,0
in faith.

74
02:35:37,0 --> 02:35:37,0
Trifle not with these

75
02:35:37,0 --> 02:35:37,0
things; do not

76
02:35:37,0 --> 02:35:37,0
ask for that

77
02:35:37,0 --> 02:44:19,
which you ought not.

78
02:44:19,0 --> 02:44:19,0
11 Ask that you

79
02:44:19,0 --> 02:44:19,0
may know the

80
02:44:19,0 --> 02:44:19,0
mysteries of

81
02:44:19,0 --> 02:44:19,0
God, and that you

82
02:44:19,0 --> 02:44:19,0
may translate

83
02:44:19,0 --> 02:44:19,0
and receive

84
02:44:19,0 --> 02:44:19,0
knowledge from all

85
02:44:19,0 --> 02:44:19,0
those ancient

86
02:44:19,0 --> 02:44:19,0
records which

87
02:44:19,0 --> 02:44:19,0
have been hid up,

88
02:44:19,0 --> 02:44:19,0
that are

89
02:44:19,0 --> 02:44:19,0
sacred; and

90
02:44:19,0 --> 02:44:19,0
according to your faith

91
02:44:19,0 --> 02:45:31,
shall it be done unto you.

92
02:45:31,0 --> 02:45:31,0
12 Behold, it

93
02:45:31,0 --> 02:45:31,0
is I that have

94
02:45:31,0 --> 02:45:31,0
spoken it;

95
02:45:31,0 --> 02:45:31,0
and I am the

96
02:45:31,0 --> 02:45:31,0
same that spake

97
02:45:31,0 --> 02:45:31,0
unto you from

98
02:45:31,0 --> 02:57:00,
the beginning. Amen.
