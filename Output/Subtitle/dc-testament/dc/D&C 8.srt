Section 8 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:03,455 --> 00:00:06,91
the Prophet to Oliver Cowdery, at Harmony,

3
00:00:06,91 --> 00:00:10,365
Pennsylvania, April 1829. In the course of the

4
00:00:10,365 --> 00:00:13,82
translation of the Book of Mormon, Oliver, who

5
00:00:13,82 --> 00:00:17,275
continued to serve as scribe, writing at the

6
00:00:17,275 --> 00:00:20,73
Prophet’s dictation, desired to be endowed with the

7
00:00:20,73 --> 00:00:24,185
gift of translation. The Lord responded to his

8
00:00:24,185 --> 00:00:27,64
supplication by granting this revelation. 
1–5,

9
00:00:27,64 --> 00:00:31,095
Revelation comes by the power of the Holy

10
00:00:31,095 --> 00:00:34,55
Ghost; 
6–12, Knowledge of the mysteries of God and

11
00:00:34,55 --> 00:00:38,205
the power to translate ancient records come by faith. 

12
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:42,605
1 Oliver Cowdery, verily, verily, I say

13
00:00:42,605 --> 00:00:47,005
unto you, that assuredly as the Lord liveth,

14
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:51,405
who is your God and your Redeemer, even so

15
00:00:51,405 --> 00:00:55,805
surely shall you receive a knowledge of

16
00:00:55,805 --> 00:01:00,205
whatsoever things you shall ask in faith, with

17
00:01:00,205 --> 00:01:04,605
an honest heart, believing that you shall

18
00:01:04,605 --> 00:01:09,005
receive a knowledge concerning the

19
00:01:09,005 --> 00:01:13,405
engravings of old records, which are ancient, which

20
00:01:13,405 --> 00:01:17,805
contain those parts of my scripture of

21
00:01:17,805 --> 00:01:22,482
which has been spoken by the manifestation of my Spirit.

22
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:36,482
2 Yea, behold, I will tell you in

23
00:01:36,482 --> 00:01:50,482
your mind and in your heart, by the

24
00:01:50,482 --> 00:02:04,482
Holy Ghost, which shall come upon you

25
00:02:04,482 --> 00:02:18,772
and which shall dwell in your heart.

26
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:22,572
3 Now, behold, this is the

27
00:02:22,572 --> 00:02:26,372
spirit of revelation; behold, this

28
00:02:26,372 --> 00:02:30,172
is the spirit by which Moses

29
00:02:30,172 --> 00:02:33,972
brought the children of Israel

30
00:02:33,972 --> 00:02:37,124
through the Red Sea on dry ground.

31
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:41,695
4 Therefore this is thy gift;

32
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:46,266
apply unto it, and blessed

33
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:50,837
art thou, for it shall deliver

34
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:55,408
you out of the hands of your

35
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:59,979
enemies, when, if it were

36
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:04,55
not so, they would slay you and

37
00:03:04,55 --> 00:03:09,489
bring your soul to destruction.

38
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:10,822
5 Oh, remember these words,

39
00:03:10,822 --> 00:03:12,155
and keep my commandments.

40
00:03:12,155 --> 00:03:13,894
Remember, this is your gift.

41
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:16,094
6 Now this is not all

42
00:03:16,094 --> 00:03:18,294
thy gift; for you have

43
00:03:18,294 --> 00:03:20,494
another gift, which is the

44
00:03:20,494 --> 00:03:22,694
gift of Aaron; behold,

45
00:03:22,694 --> 00:03:24,237
it has told you many things;

46
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:24,037
7 Behold, there is no

47
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:23,837
other power, save

48
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:23,637
the power of God, that

49
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:23,437
can cause this gift

50
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:23,77
of Aaron to be with you.

51
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
8 Therefore, doubt

52
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
not, for it is the

53
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
gift of God; and you

54
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
shall hold it in your

55
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
hands, and do

56
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
marvelous works; and no

57
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
power shall be able

58
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
to take it away out

59
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
of your hands, for it

60
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
is the work of God.

61
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
9 And, therefore,

62
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
whatsoever you

63
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
shall ask me to tell

64
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
you by that means,

65
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
that will I grant

66
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
unto you, and you

67
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
shall have

68
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
knowledge concerning it.

69
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
10 Remember that

70
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
without faith

71
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
you can do

72
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
nothing; therefore ask

73
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
in faith.

74
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
Trifle not with these

75
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
things; do not

76
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
ask for that

77
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
which you ought not.

78
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
11 Ask that you

79
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
may know the

80
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
mysteries of

81
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
God, and that you

82
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
may translate

83
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
and receive

84
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
knowledge from all

85
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
those ancient

86
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
records which

87
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
have been hid up,

88
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
that are

89
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
sacred; and

90
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
according to your faith

91
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
shall it be done unto you.

92
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
12 Behold, it

93
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
is I that have

94
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
spoken it;

95
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
and I am the

96
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
same that spake

97
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
unto you from

98
00:03:23,77 --> 00:03:23,77
the beginning. Amen.
