1
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:19,061
Section 10 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet, at 

2
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:26,843
Harmony, Pennsylvania, likely around April 1829, though portions may have 

3
00:00:26,843 --> 00:00:34,626
been received as early as the summer of 1828. Herein 

4
00:00:34,626 --> 00:00:42,408
the Lord informs Joseph of alterations made by wicked men 

5
00:00:42,408 --> 00:00:50,191
in the 116 manuscript pages from the translation of the 

6
00:00:50,191 --> 00:00:57,974
book of Lehi, in the Book of Mormon. These manuscript 

7
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:05,756
pages had been lost from the possession of Martin Harris, 

8
00:01:05,756 --> 00:01:13,539
to whom the sheets had been temporarily entrusted. (See the 

9
00:01:13,539 --> 00:01:21,321

heading to section 3.) The evil design was to await the 

10
00:01:21,321 --> 00:01:29,104
expected retranslation of the matter covered by the stolen pages 

11
00:01:29,104 --> 00:01:36,887
and then to discredit the translator by showing discrepancies created 

12
00:01:36,887 --> 00:01:44,669
by the alterations. That this wicked purpose had been conceived 

13
00:01:44,669 --> 00:01:52,452
by the evil one and was known to the Lord 

14
00:01:52,452 --> 00:02:00,234
even while Mormon, the ancient Nephite historian, was making his 

15
00:02:00,234 --> 00:02:08,017
abridgment of the accumulated plates, is shown in the Book 

16
00:02:08,017 --> 00:02:15,8
of Mormon (see 
Words of Mormon 1:3–7). 
1–26, Satan stirs 

17
00:02:15,8 --> 00:02:23,582
up wicked men to oppose the Lord’s work; 
27–33, He 

18
00:02:23,582 --> 00:02:31,365
seeks to destroy the souls of men; 
34–52, The gospel 

19
00:02:31,365 --> 00:02:39,147
is to go to the Lamanites and all nations through 

20
00:02:39,147 --> 00:02:46,93
the Book of Mormon; 
53–63, The Lord will establish His 

21
00:02:46,93 --> 00:02:54,713
Church and His gospel among men; 
64–70, He will gather 

22
00:02:54,713 --> 00:03:02,495
the repentant into His Church and will save the obedient. 

23
00:03:02,495 --> 00:03:10,278
 

24
00:03:10,69 --> 00:03:15,69
1 Now, behold, I say unto you, that because you 

25
00:03:15,69 --> 00:03:20,69
delivered up those writings which you had power given unto 

26
00:03:20,69 --> 00:03:25,69
you to translate by the means of the Urim and 

27
00:03:25,69 --> 00:03:30,69
Thummim, into the hands of a wicked man, you have 

28
00:03:30,69 --> 00:03:35,69
lost them. 

29
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:40,182
2 And you also lost your gift at the same 

30
00:03:40,182 --> 00:03:44,682
time, and your mind became darkened. 

31
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:48,507
3 Nevertheless, it is now restored unto you again; therefore 

32
00:03:48,507 --> 00:03:52,757
see that you are faithful and continue on unto the 

33
00:03:52,757 --> 00:03:57,007
finishing of the remainder of the work of translation as 

34
00:03:57,007 --> 00:04:01,257
you have begun. 

35
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:06,941
4 Do not run faster or labor more than you 

36
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:12,608
have strength and means provided to enable you to translate; 

37
00:04:12,608 --> 00:04:18,274
but be diligent unto the end. 

38
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:23,558
5 Pray always, that you may come off conqueror; yea, 

39
00:04:23,558 --> 00:04:29,058
that you may conquer Satan, and that you may escape 

40
00:04:29,058 --> 00:04:34,558
the hands of the servants of Satan that do uphold 

41
00:04:34,558 --> 00:04:40,058
his work. 

42
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:44,013
6 Behold, they have sought to destroy you; yea, even 

43
00:04:44,013 --> 00:04:48,013
the man in whom you have trusted has sought to 

44
00:04:48,013 --> 00:04:52,013
destroy you. 

45
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:56,309
7 And for this cause I said that he is 

46
00:04:56,309 --> 00:05:00,059
a wicked man, for he has sought to take away 

47
00:05:00,059 --> 00:05:03,809
the things wherewith you have been entrusted; and he has 

48
00:05:03,809 --> 00:05:07,559
also sought to destroy your gift. 

49
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:16,308
8 And because you have delivered the writings into his 

50
00:05:16,308 --> 00:05:24,808
hands, behold, wicked men have taken them from you. 

51
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:29,357
9 Therefore, you have delivered them up, yea, that which 

52
00:05:29,357 --> 00:05:34,357
was sacred, unto wickedness. 

53
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:39,901
10 And, behold, Satan hath put it into their hearts 

54
00:05:39,901 --> 00:05:44,901
to alter the words which you have caused to be 

55
00:05:44,901 --> 00:05:49,901
written, or which you have translated, which have gone out 

56
00:05:49,901 --> 00:05:54,901
of your hands. 

57
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:59,487
11 And behold, I say unto you, that because they 

58
00:05:59,487 --> 00:06:04,82
have altered the words, they read contrary from that which 

59
00:06:04,82 --> 00:06:10,154
you translated and caused to be written; 

60
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:15,204
12 And, on this wise, the devil has sought to 

61
00:06:15,204 --> 00:06:19,704
lay a cunning plan, that he may destroy this work; 

62
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:25,213
13 For he hath put into their hearts to do 

63
00:06:25,213 --> 00:06:30,879
this, that by lying they may say they have caught 

64
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:36,546
you in the words which you have pretended to translate. 

65
00:06:36,83 --> 00:06:40,496
14 Verily, I say unto you, that I will not 

66
00:06:40,496 --> 00:06:44,163
suffer that Satan shall accomplish his evil design in this 

67
00:06:44,163 --> 00:06:47,83
thing. 

68
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:52,274
15 For behold, he has put it into their hearts 

69
00:06:52,274 --> 00:06:56,941
to get thee to tempt the Lord thy God, in 

70
00:06:56,941 --> 00:07:01,607
asking to translate it over again. 

71
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:05,021
16 And then, behold, they say and think in their 

72
00:07:05,021 --> 00:07:08,688
hearts—We will see if God has given him power to 

73
00:07:08,688 --> 00:07:12,354
translate; if so, he will also give him power again; 

74
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:16,866
17 And if God giveth him power again, or if 

75
00:07:16,866 --> 00:07:20,866
he translates again, or, in other words, if he bringeth 

76
00:07:20,866 --> 00:07:24,866
forth the same words, behold, we have the same with 

77
00:07:24,866 --> 00:07:28,866
us, and we have altered them; 

78
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:33,781
18 Therefore they will not agree, and we will say 

79
00:07:33,781 --> 00:07:39,448
that he has lied in his words, and that he 

80
00:07:39,448 --> 00:07:45,114
has no gift, and that he has no power; 

81
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:49,631
19 Therefore we will destroy him, and also the work; 

82
00:07:49,631 --> 00:07:54,131
and we will do this that we may not be 

83
00:07:54,131 --> 00:07:58,631
ashamed in the end, and that we may get glory 

84
00:07:58,631 --> 00:08:03,131
of the world. 

85
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:07,416
20 Verily, verily, I say unto you, that Satan has 

86
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:11,416
great hold upon their hearts; he stirreth them up to 

87
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:15,416
iniquity against that which is good; 

88
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:20,145
21 And their hearts are corrupt, and full of wickedness 

89
00:08:20,145 --> 00:08:24,895
and abominations; and they love darkness rather than light, because 

90
00:08:24,895 --> 00:08:29,645
their deeds are evil; therefore they will not ask of 

91
00:08:29,645 --> 00:08:34,395
me. 

92
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:37,881
22 Satan stirreth them up, that he may lead their 

93
00:08:37,881 --> 00:08:41,381
souls to destruction. 

94
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:48,388
23 And thus he has laid a cunning plan, thinking 

95
00:08:48,388 --> 00:08:54,888
to destroy the work of God; but I will require 

96
00:08:54,888 --> 00:09:01,388
this at their hands, and it shall turn to their 

97
00:09:01,388 --> 00:09:07,888
shame and condemnation in the day of judgment. 

98
00:09:07,38 --> 00:09:10,88
24 Yea, he stirreth up their hearts to anger against 

99
00:09:10,88 --> 00:09:14,38
this work. 

100
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:19,221
25 Yea, he saith unto them: Deceive and lie in 

101
00:09:19,221 --> 00:09:23,554
wait to catch, that ye may destroy; behold, this is 

102
00:09:23,554 --> 00:09:27,888
no harm. And thus he flattereth them, and telleth them 

103
00:09:27,888 --> 00:09:32,221
that it is no sin to lie that they may 

104
00:09:32,221 --> 00:09:36,554
catch a man in a lie, that they may destroy 

105
00:09:36,554 --> 00:09:40,888
him. 

106
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:47,514
26 And thus he flattereth them, and leadeth them along 

107
00:09:47,514 --> 00:09:54,18
until he draggeth their souls down to hell; and thus 

108
00:09:54,18 --> 00:10:00,847
he causeth them to catch themselves in their own snare. 

109
00:10:00,1 --> 00:10:04,1
27 And thus he goeth up and down, to and 

110
00:10:04,1 --> 00:10:08,1
fro in the earth, seeking to destroy the souls of 

111
00:10:08,1 --> 00:10:12,1
men. 

112
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:16,578
28 Verily, verily, I say unto you, wo be unto 

113
00:10:16,578 --> 00:10:21,078
him that lieth to deceive because he supposeth that another 

114
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:25,578
lieth to deceive, for such are not exempt from the 

115
00:10:25,578 --> 00:10:30,078
justice of God. 

116
00:10:30,63 --> 00:10:36,88
29 Now, behold, they have altered these words, because Satan 

117
00:10:36,88 --> 00:10:43,13
saith unto them: He hath deceived you—and thus he flattereth 

118
00:10:43,13 --> 00:10:49,38
them away to do iniquity, to get thee to tempt 

119
00:10:49,38 --> 00:10:55,63
the Lord thy God. 

120
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:58,488
30 Behold, I say unto you, that you shall not 

121
00:10:58,488 --> 00:11:01,821
translate again those words which have gone forth out of 

122
00:11:01,821 --> 00:11:05,154
your hands; 

123
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:11,098
31 For, behold, they shall not accomplish their evil designs 

124
00:11:11,098 --> 00:11:16,498
in lying against those words. For, behold, if you should 

125
00:11:16,498 --> 00:11:21,898
bring forth the same words they will say that you 

126
00:11:21,898 --> 00:11:27,298
have lied and that you have pretended to translate, but 

127
00:11:27,298 --> 00:11:32,698
that you have contradicted yourself. 

128
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:37,192
32 And, behold, they will publish this, and Satan will 

129
00:11:37,192 --> 00:11:42,192
harden the hearts of the people to stir them up 

130
00:11:42,192 --> 00:11:47,192
to anger against you, that they will not believe my 

131
00:11:47,192 --> 00:11:52,192
words. 

132
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:57,478
33 Thus Satan thinketh to overpower your testimony in this 

133
00:11:57,478 --> 00:12:02,811
generation, that the work may not come forth in this 

134
00:12:02,811 --> 00:12:08,145
generation. 

135
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:13,344
34 But behold, here is wisdom, and because I show 

136
00:12:13,344 --> 00:12:18,594
unto you wisdom, and give you commandments concerning these things, 

137
00:12:18,594 --> 00:12:23,844
what you shall do, show it not unto the world 

138
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:29,094
until you have accomplished the work of translation. 

139
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:36,249
35 Marvel not that I said unto you: Here is 

140
00:12:36,249 --> 00:12:42,916
wisdom, show it not unto the world—for I said, show 

141
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:49,582
it not unto the world, that you may be preserved. 

142
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:52,068
36 Behold, I do not say that you shall not 

143
00:12:52,068 --> 00:12:55,068
show it unto the righteous; 

144
00:12:55,608 --> 00:13:01,408
37 But as you cannot always judge the righteous, or 

145
00:13:01,408 --> 00:13:07,208
as you cannot always tell the wicked from the righteous, 

146
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:13,008
therefore I say unto you, hold your peace until I 

147
00:13:13,008 --> 00:13:18,808
shall see fit to make all things known unto the 

148
00:13:18,808 --> 00:13:24,608
world concerning the matter. 

149
00:13:24,17 --> 00:13:27,67
38 And now, verily I say unto you, that an 

150
00:13:27,67 --> 00:13:31,17
account of those things that you have written, which have 

151
00:13:31,17 --> 00:13:34,67
gone out of your hands, is engraven upon the plates 

152
00:13:34,67 --> 00:13:38,17
of Nephi; 

153
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:43,251
39 Yea, and you remember it was said in those 

154
00:13:43,251 --> 00:13:47,585
writings that a more particular account was given of these 

155
00:13:47,585 --> 00:13:51,918
things upon the plates of Nephi. 

156
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:55,198
40 And now, because the account which is engraven upon 

157
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:58,698
the plates of Nephi is more particular concerning the things 

158
00:13:58,698 --> 00:14:02,198
which, in my wisdom, I would bring to the knowledge 

159
00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:05,698
of the people in this account— 

160
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:10,928
41 Therefore, you shall translate the engravings which are on 

161
00:14:10,928 --> 00:14:16,178
the plates of Nephi, down even till you come to 

162
00:14:16,178 --> 00:14:21,428
the reign of king Benjamin, or until you come to 

163
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:26,678
that which you have translated, which you have retained; 

164
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:31,999
42 And behold, you shall publish it as the record 

165
00:14:31,999 --> 00:14:37,332
of Nephi; and thus I will confound those who have 

166
00:14:37,332 --> 00:14:42,666
altered my words. 

167
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:47,382
43 I will not suffer that they shall destroy my 

168
00:14:47,382 --> 00:14:52,049
work; yea, I will show unto them that my wisdom 

169
00:14:52,049 --> 00:14:56,715
is greater than the cunning of the devil. 

170
00:14:56,996 --> 00:15:02,996
44 Behold, they have only got a part, or an 

171
00:15:02,996 --> 00:15:08,996
abridgment of the account of Nephi. 

172
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:11,708
45 Behold, there are many things engraven upon the plates 

173
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:14,908
of Nephi which do throw greater views upon my gospel; 

174
00:15:14,908 --> 00:15:18,108
therefore, it is wisdom in me that you should translate 

175
00:15:18,108 --> 00:15:21,308
this first part of the engravings of Nephi, and send 

176
00:15:21,308 --> 00:15:24,508
forth in this work. 

177
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:32,207
46 And, behold, all the remainder of this work does 

178
00:15:32,207 --> 00:15:39,957
contain all those parts of my gospel which my holy 

179
00:15:39,957 --> 00:15:47,707
prophets, yea, and also my disciples, desired in their prayers 

180
00:15:47,707 --> 00:15:55,457
should come forth unto this people. 

181
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:59,654
47 And I said unto them, that it should be 

182
00:15:59,654 --> 00:16:04,154
granted unto them according to their faith in their prayers; 

183
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:10,947
48 Yea, and this was their faith—that my gospel, which 

184
00:16:10,947 --> 00:16:17,197
I gave unto them that they might preach in their 

185
00:16:17,197 --> 00:16:23,447
days, might come unto their brethren the Lamanites, and also 

186
00:16:23,447 --> 00:16:29,697
all that had become Lamanites because of their dissensions. 

187
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:35,289
49 Now, this is not all—their faith in their prayers 

188
00:16:35,289 --> 00:16:40,622
was that this gospel should be made known also, if 

189
00:16:40,622 --> 00:16:45,956
it were possible that other nations should possess this land; 

190
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:50,338
50 And thus they did leave a blessing upon this 

191
00:16:50,338 --> 00:16:55,005
land in their prayers, that whosoever should believe in this 

192
00:16:55,005 --> 00:16:59,671
gospel in this land might have eternal life; 

193
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:04,152
51 Yea, that it might be free unto all of 

194
00:17:04,152 --> 00:17:08,652
whatsoever nation, kindred, tongue, or people they may be. 

195
00:17:08,06 --> 00:17:13,46
52 And now, behold, according to their faith in their 

196
00:17:13,46 --> 00:17:18,86
prayers will I bring this part of my gospel to 

197
00:17:18,86 --> 00:17:24,26
the knowledge of my people. Behold, I do not bring 

198
00:17:24,26 --> 00:17:29,66
it to destroy that which they have received, but to 

199
00:17:29,66 --> 00:17:35,06
build it up. 

200
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:38,687
53 And for this cause have I said: If this 

201
00:17:38,687 --> 00:17:42,354
generation harden not their hearts, I will establish my church 

202
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:46,021
among them. 

203
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:51,999
54 Now I do not say this to destroy my 

204
00:17:51,999 --> 00:17:56,999
church, but I say this to build up my church; 

205
00:17:56,776 --> 00:18:02,776
55 Therefore, whosoever belongeth to my church need not fear, 

206
00:18:02,776 --> 00:18:08,776
for such shall inherit the kingdom of heaven. 

207
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:13,664
56 But it is they who do not fear me, 

208
00:18:13,664 --> 00:18:18,806
neither keep my commandments but build up churches unto themselves 

209
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:23,949
to get gain, yea, and all those that do wickedly 

210
00:18:23,949 --> 00:18:29,092
and build up the kingdom of the devil—yea, verily, verily, 

211
00:18:29,092 --> 00:18:34,235
I say unto you, that it is they that I 

212
00:18:34,235 --> 00:18:39,378
will disturb, and cause to tremble and shake to the 

213
00:18:39,378 --> 00:18:44,521
center. 

214
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:48,424
57 Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God. 

215
00:18:48,424 --> 00:18:52,09
I came unto mine own, and mine own received me 

216
00:18:52,09 --> 00:18:55,757
not. 

217
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:59,768
58 I am the light which shineth in darkness, and 

218
00:18:59,768 --> 00:19:03,768
the darkness comprehendeth it not. 

219
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:08,275
59 I am he who said—Other sheep have I which 

220
00:19:08,275 --> 00:19:13,275
are not of this fold—unto my disciples, and many there 

221
00:19:13,275 --> 00:19:18,275
were that understood me not. 

222
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:22,758
60 And I will show unto this people that I 

223
00:19:22,758 --> 00:19:26,758
had other sheep, and that they were a branch of 

224
00:19:26,758 --> 00:19:30,758
the house of Jacob; 

225
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:36,036
61 And I will bring to light their marvelous works, 

226
00:19:36,036 --> 00:19:41,536
which they did in my name; 

227
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:46,481
62 Yea, and I will also bring to light my 

228
00:19:46,481 --> 00:19:51,147
gospel which was ministered unto them, and, behold, they shall 

229
00:19:51,147 --> 00:19:55,814
not deny that which you have received, but they shall 

230
00:19:55,814 --> 00:20:00,481
build it up, and shall bring to light the true 

231
00:20:00,481 --> 00:20:05,147
points of my doctrine, yea, and the only doctrine which 

232
00:20:05,147 --> 00:20:09,814
is in me. 

233
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:14,908
63 And this I do that I may establish my 

234
00:20:14,908 --> 00:20:20,408
gospel, that there may not be so much contention; yea, 

235
00:20:20,408 --> 00:20:25,908
Satan doth stir up the hearts of the people to 

236
00:20:25,908 --> 00:20:31,408
contention concerning the points of my doctrine; and in these 

237
00:20:31,408 --> 00:20:36,908
things they do err, for they do wrest the scriptures 

238
00:20:36,908 --> 00:20:42,408
and do not understand them. 

239
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:53,141
64 Therefore, I will unfold unto them this great mystery; 

240
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:59,485
65 For, behold, I will gather them as a hen 

241
00:20:59,485 --> 00:21:05,819
gathereth her chickens under her wings, if they will not 

242
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:12,152
harden their hearts; 

243
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:18,872
66 Yea, if they will come, they may, and partake 

244
00:21:18,872 --> 00:21:24,872
of the waters of life freely. 

245
00:21:24,15 --> 00:21:29,15
67 Behold, this is my doctrine—whosoever repenteth and cometh unto 

246
00:21:29,15 --> 00:21:34,15
me, the same is my church. 

247
00:21:34,16 --> 00:21:40,16
68 Whosoever declareth more or less than this, the same 

248
00:21:40,16 --> 00:21:46,16
is not of me, but is against me; therefore he 

249
00:21:46,16 --> 00:21:52,16
is not of my church. 

250
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:56,928
69 And now, behold, whosoever is of my church, and 

251
00:21:56,928 --> 00:22:01,178
endureth of my church to the end, him will I 

252
00:22:01,178 --> 00:22:05,428
establish upon my rock, and the gates of hell shall 

253
00:22:05,428 --> 00:22:09,678
not prevail against them. 

254
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:15,028
70 And now, remember the words of him who is 

255
00:22:15,028 --> 00:22:20,362
the life and light of the world, your Redeemer, your 

256
00:22:20,362 --> 00:22:25,695
Lord and your God. Amen.
