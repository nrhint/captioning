1
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:37,083
Words of Mormon 1:3–7). 
1–26, Satan stirs up wicked men 

2
00:00:37,083 --> 00:01:02,654
to oppose the Lord’s work; 
27–33, He seeks to destroy 

3
00:01:02,654 --> 00:01:28,226
the souls of men; 
34–52, The gospel is to go 

4
00:01:28,226 --> 00:01:53,797
to the Lamanites and all nations through the Book of 

5
00:01:53,797 --> 00:02:19,369
Mormon; 
53–63, The Lord will establish His Church and His 

6
00:02:19,369 --> 00:02:44,94
gospel among men; 
64–70, He will gather the repentant into 

7
00:02:44,94 --> 00:03:10,512
His Church and will save the obedient.  

8
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:15,924
1 Now, behold, I say unto you, that because you 

9
00:03:15,924 --> 00:03:20,924
delivered up those writings which you had power given unto 

10
00:03:20,924 --> 00:03:25,924
you to translate by the means of the Urim and 

11
00:03:25,924 --> 00:03:30,924
Thummim, into the hands of a wicked man, you have 

12
00:03:30,924 --> 00:03:35,924
lost them. 

13
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:39,982
2 And you also lost your gift at the same 

14
00:03:39,982 --> 00:03:44,482
time, and your mind became darkened. 

15
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:48,808
3 Nevertheless, it is now restored unto you again; therefore 

16
00:03:48,808 --> 00:03:53,058
see that you are faithful and continue on unto the 

17
00:03:53,058 --> 00:03:57,308
finishing of the remainder of the work of translation as 

18
00:03:57,308 --> 00:04:01,558
you have begun. 

19
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:06,774
4 Do not run faster or labor more than you 

20
00:04:06,774 --> 00:04:12,441
have strength and means provided to enable you to translate; 

21
00:04:12,441 --> 00:04:18,108
but be diligent unto the end. 

22
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:23,625
5 Pray always, that you may come off conqueror; yea, 

23
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:29,125
that you may conquer Satan, and that you may escape 

24
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:34,625
the hands of the servants of Satan that do uphold 

25
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:40,125
his work. 

26
00:04:40,08 --> 00:04:44,08
6 Behold, they have sought to destroy you; yea, even 

27
00:04:44,08 --> 00:04:48,08
the man in whom you have trusted has sought to 

28
00:04:48,08 --> 00:04:52,08
destroy you. 

29
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:56,659
7 And for this cause I said that he is 

30
00:04:56,659 --> 00:05:00,659
a wicked man, for he has sought to take away 

31
00:05:00,659 --> 00:05:04,659
the things wherewith you have been entrusted; and he has 

32
00:05:04,659 --> 00:05:08,659
also sought to destroy your gift. 

33
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:16,608
8 And because you have delivered the writings into his 

34
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:24,608
hands, behold, wicked men have taken them from you. 

35
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:30,058
9 Therefore, you have delivered them up, yea, that which 

36
00:05:30,058 --> 00:05:35,558
was sacred, unto wickedness. 

37
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:39,851
10 And, behold, Satan hath put it into their hearts 

38
00:05:39,851 --> 00:05:44,601
to alter the words which you have caused to be 

39
00:05:44,601 --> 00:05:49,351
written, or which you have translated, which have gone out 

40
00:05:49,351 --> 00:05:54,101
of your hands. 

41
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:59,754
11 And behold, I say unto you, that because they 

42
00:05:59,754 --> 00:06:05,42
have altered the words, they read contrary from that which 

43
00:06:05,42 --> 00:06:11,087
you translated and caused to be written; 

44
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:15,137
12 And, on this wise, the devil has sought to 

45
00:06:15,137 --> 00:06:19,137
lay a cunning plan, that he may destroy this work; 

46
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:25,379
13 For he hath put into their hearts to do 

47
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:31,046
this, that by lying they may say they have caught 

48
00:06:31,046 --> 00:06:36,713
you in the words which you have pretended to translate. 

49
00:06:36,73 --> 00:06:40,396
14 Verily, I say unto you, that I will not 

50
00:06:40,396 --> 00:06:44,063
suffer that Satan shall accomplish his evil design in this 

51
00:06:44,063 --> 00:06:47,73
thing. 

52
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:52,407
15 For behold, he has put it into their hearts 

53
00:06:52,407 --> 00:06:57,074
to get thee to tempt the Lord thy God, in 

54
00:06:57,074 --> 00:07:01,741
asking to translate it over again. 

55
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:05,254
16 And then, behold, they say and think in their 

56
00:07:05,254 --> 00:07:09,254
hearts—We will see if God has given him power to 

57
00:07:09,254 --> 00:07:13,254
translate; if so, he will also give him power again; 

58
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:16,983
17 And if God giveth him power again, or if 

59
00:07:16,983 --> 00:07:20,733
he translates again, or, in other words, if he bringeth 

60
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:24,483
forth the same words, behold, we have the same with 

61
00:07:24,483 --> 00:07:28,233
us, and we have altered them; 

62
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:34,015
18 Therefore they will not agree, and we will say 

63
00:07:34,015 --> 00:07:39,681
that he has lied in his words, and that he 

64
00:07:39,681 --> 00:07:45,348
has no gift, and that he has no power; 

65
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:49,865
19 Therefore we will destroy him, and also the work; 

66
00:07:49,865 --> 00:07:54,365
and we will do this that we may not be 

67
00:07:54,365 --> 00:07:58,865
ashamed in the end, and that we may get glory 

68
00:07:58,865 --> 00:08:03,365
of the world. 

69
00:08:03,35 --> 00:08:07,35
20 Verily, verily, I say unto you, that Satan has 

70
00:08:07,35 --> 00:08:11,35
great hold upon their hearts; he stirreth them up to 

71
00:08:11,35 --> 00:08:15,35
iniquity against that which is good; 

72
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:20,112
21 And their hearts are corrupt, and full of wickedness 

73
00:08:20,112 --> 00:08:24,862
and abominations; and they love darkness rather than light, because 

74
00:08:24,862 --> 00:08:29,612
their deeds are evil; therefore they will not ask of 

75
00:08:29,612 --> 00:08:34,362
me. 

76
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,847
22 Satan stirreth them up, that he may lead their 

77
00:08:37,847 --> 00:08:41,347
souls to destruction. 

78
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:48,355
23 And thus he has laid a cunning plan, thinking 

79
00:08:48,355 --> 00:08:54,855
to destroy the work of God; but I will require 

80
00:08:54,855 --> 00:09:01,355
this at their hands, and it shall turn to their 

81
00:09:01,355 --> 00:09:07,855
shame and condemnation in the day of judgment. 

82
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:10,847
24 Yea, he stirreth up their hearts to anger against 

83
00:09:10,847 --> 00:09:14,347
this work. 

84
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:19,288
25 Yea, he saith unto them: Deceive and lie in 

85
00:09:19,288 --> 00:09:23,621
wait to catch, that ye may destroy; behold, this is 

86
00:09:23,621 --> 00:09:27,954
no harm. And thus he flattereth them, and telleth them 

87
00:09:27,954 --> 00:09:32,288
that it is no sin to lie that they may 

88
00:09:32,288 --> 00:09:36,621
catch a man in a lie, that they may destroy 

89
00:09:36,621 --> 00:09:40,954
him. 

90
00:09:40,98 --> 00:09:47,647
26 And thus he flattereth them, and leadeth them along 

91
00:09:47,647 --> 00:09:54,314
until he draggeth their souls down to hell; and thus 

92
00:09:54,314 --> 00:10:00,98
he causeth them to catch themselves in their own snare. 

93
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:04,133
27 And thus he goeth up and down, to and 

94
00:10:04,133 --> 00:10:07,8
fro in the earth, seeking to destroy the souls of 

95
00:10:07,8 --> 00:10:11,467
men. 

96
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:16,728
28 Verily, verily, I say unto you, wo be unto 

97
00:10:16,728 --> 00:10:21,478
him that lieth to deceive because he supposeth that another 

98
00:10:21,478 --> 00:10:26,228
lieth to deceive, for such are not exempt from the 

99
00:10:26,228 --> 00:10:30,978
justice of God. 

100
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:36,747
29 Now, behold, they have altered these words, because Satan 

101
00:10:36,747 --> 00:10:42,997
saith unto them: He hath deceived you—and thus he flattereth 

102
00:10:42,997 --> 00:10:49,247
them away to do iniquity, to get thee to tempt 

103
00:10:49,247 --> 00:10:55,497
the Lord thy God. 

104
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,822
30 Behold, I say unto you, that you shall not 

105
00:10:58,822 --> 00:11:02,155
translate again those words which have gone forth out of 

106
00:11:02,155 --> 00:11:05,488
your hands; 

107
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:10,998
31 For, behold, they shall not accomplish their evil designs 

108
00:11:10,998 --> 00:11:16,398
in lying against those words. For, behold, if you should 

109
00:11:16,398 --> 00:11:21,798
bring forth the same words they will say that you 

110
00:11:21,798 --> 00:11:27,198
have lied and that you have pretended to translate, but 

111
00:11:27,198 --> 00:11:32,598
that you have contradicted yourself. 

112
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:37,091
32 And, behold, they will publish this, and Satan will 

113
00:11:37,091 --> 00:11:42,091
harden the hearts of the people to stir them up 

114
00:11:42,091 --> 00:11:47,091
to anger against you, that they will not believe my 

115
00:11:47,091 --> 00:11:52,091
words. 

116
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:57,445
33 Thus Satan thinketh to overpower your testimony in this 

117
00:11:57,445 --> 00:12:02,778
generation, that the work may not come forth in this 

118
00:12:02,778 --> 00:12:08,111
generation. 

119
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:13,311
34 But behold, here is wisdom, and because I show 

120
00:12:13,311 --> 00:12:18,561
unto you wisdom, and give you commandments concerning these things, 

121
00:12:18,561 --> 00:12:23,811
what you shall do, show it not unto the world 

122
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:29,061
until you have accomplished the work of translation. 

123
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:36,215
35 Marvel not that I said unto you: Here is 

124
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:42,882
wisdom, show it not unto the world—for I said, show 

125
00:12:42,882 --> 00:12:49,549
it not unto the world, that you may be preserved. 

126
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:52,035
36 Behold, I do not say that you shall not 

127
00:12:52,035 --> 00:12:55,035
show it unto the righteous; 

128
00:12:55,608 --> 00:13:01,408
37 But as you cannot always judge the righteous, or 

129
00:13:01,408 --> 00:13:07,208
as you cannot always tell the wicked from the righteous, 

130
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:13,008
therefore I say unto you, hold your peace until I 

131
00:13:13,008 --> 00:13:18,808
shall see fit to make all things known unto the 

132
00:13:18,808 --> 00:13:24,608
world concerning the matter. 

133
00:13:24,17 --> 00:13:27,92
38 And now, verily I say unto you, that an 

134
00:13:27,92 --> 00:13:31,67
account of those things that you have written, which have 

135
00:13:31,67 --> 00:13:35,42
gone out of your hands, is engraven upon the plates 

136
00:13:35,42 --> 00:13:39,17
of Nephi; 

137
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:43,152
39 Yea, and you remember it was said in those 

138
00:13:43,152 --> 00:13:47,152
writings that a more particular account was given of these 

139
00:13:47,152 --> 00:13:51,152
things upon the plates of Nephi. 

140
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:55,198
40 And now, because the account which is engraven upon 

141
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:58,698
the plates of Nephi is more particular concerning the things 

142
00:13:58,698 --> 00:14:02,198
which, in my wisdom, I would bring to the knowledge 

143
00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:05,698
of the people in this account— 

144
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:10,928
41 Therefore, you shall translate the engravings which are on 

145
00:14:10,928 --> 00:14:16,178
the plates of Nephi, down even till you come to 

146
00:14:16,178 --> 00:14:21,428
the reign of king Benjamin, or until you come to 

147
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:26,678
that which you have translated, which you have retained; 

148
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:31,999
42 And behold, you shall publish it as the record 

149
00:14:31,999 --> 00:14:37,332
of Nephi; and thus I will confound those who have 

150
00:14:37,332 --> 00:14:42,666
altered my words. 

151
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:47,715
43 I will not suffer that they shall destroy my 

152
00:14:47,715 --> 00:14:52,715
work; yea, I will show unto them that my wisdom 

153
00:14:52,715 --> 00:14:57,715
is greater than the cunning of the devil. 

154
00:14:57,23 --> 00:15:02,73
44 Behold, they have only got a part, or an 

155
00:15:02,73 --> 00:15:08,23
abridgment of the account of Nephi. 

156
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:13,241
45 Behold, there are many things engraven upon the plates 

157
00:15:13,241 --> 00:15:18,241
of Nephi which do throw greater views upon my gospel; 

158
00:15:18,241 --> 00:15:23,241
therefore, it is wisdom in me that you should translate 

159
00:15:23,241 --> 00:15:28,241
this first part of the engravings of Nephi, and send 

160
00:15:28,241 --> 00:15:33,241
forth in this work. 

161
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:39,233
46 And, behold, all the remainder of this work does 

162
00:15:39,233 --> 00:15:44,733
contain all those parts of my gospel which my holy 

163
00:15:44,733 --> 00:15:50,233
prophets, yea, and also my disciples, desired in their prayers 

164
00:15:50,233 --> 00:15:55,733
should come forth unto this people. 

165
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:59,721
47 And I said unto them, that it should be 

166
00:15:59,721 --> 00:16:04,221
granted unto them according to their faith in their prayers; 

167
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:11,264
48 Yea, and this was their faith—that my gospel, which 

168
00:16:11,264 --> 00:16:17,764
I gave unto them that they might preach in their 

169
00:16:17,764 --> 00:16:24,264
days, might come unto their brethren the Lamanites, and also 

170
00:16:24,264 --> 00:16:30,764
all that had become Lamanites because of their dissensions. 

171
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:35,256
49 Now, this is not all—their faith in their prayers 

172
00:16:35,256 --> 00:16:40,256
was that this gospel should be made known also, if 

173
00:16:40,256 --> 00:16:45,256
it were possible that other nations should possess this land; 

174
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:50,405
50 And thus they did leave a blessing upon this 

175
00:16:50,405 --> 00:16:55,071
land in their prayers, that whosoever should believe in this 

176
00:16:55,071 --> 00:16:59,738
gospel in this land might have eternal life; 

177
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:04,219
51 Yea, that it might be free unto all of 

178
00:17:04,219 --> 00:17:08,719
whatsoever nation, kindred, tongue, or people they may be. 

179
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:13,694
52 And now, behold, according to their faith in their 

180
00:17:13,694 --> 00:17:19,094
prayers will I bring this part of my gospel to 

181
00:17:19,094 --> 00:17:24,494
the knowledge of my people. Behold, I do not bring 

182
00:17:24,494 --> 00:17:29,894
it to destroy that which they have received, but to 

183
00:17:29,894 --> 00:17:35,294
build it up. 

184
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:39,254
53 And for this cause have I said: If this 

185
00:17:39,254 --> 00:17:43,254
generation harden not their hearts, I will establish my church 

186
00:17:43,254 --> 00:17:47,254
among them. 

187
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:51,733
54 Now I do not say this to destroy my 

188
00:17:51,733 --> 00:17:56,233
church, but I say this to build up my church; 

189
00:17:56,876 --> 00:18:02,876
55 Therefore, whosoever belongeth to my church need not fear, 

190
00:18:02,876 --> 00:18:08,876
for such shall inherit the kingdom of heaven. 

191
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:13,997
56 But it is they who do not fear me, 

192
00:18:13,997 --> 00:18:19,14
neither keep my commandments but build up churches unto themselves 

193
00:18:19,14 --> 00:18:24,283
to get gain, yea, and all those that do wickedly 

194
00:18:24,283 --> 00:18:29,426
and build up the kingdom of the devil—yea, verily, verily, 

195
00:18:29,426 --> 00:18:34,569
I say unto you, that it is they that I 

196
00:18:34,569 --> 00:18:39,712
will disturb, and cause to tremble and shake to the 

197
00:18:39,712 --> 00:18:44,854
center. 

198
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:48,424
57 Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God. 

199
00:18:48,424 --> 00:18:52,09
I came unto mine own, and mine own received me 

200
00:18:52,09 --> 00:18:55,757
not. 

201
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:59,768
58 I am the light which shineth in darkness, and 

202
00:18:59,768 --> 00:19:03,768
the darkness comprehendeth it not. 

203
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:08,275
59 I am he who said—Other sheep have I which 

204
00:19:08,275 --> 00:19:13,275
are not of this fold—unto my disciples, and many there 

205
00:19:13,275 --> 00:19:18,275
were that understood me not. 

206
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:22,758
60 And I will show unto this people that I 

207
00:19:22,758 --> 00:19:26,758
had other sheep, and that they were a branch of 

208
00:19:26,758 --> 00:19:30,758
the house of Jacob; 

209
00:19:30,77 --> 00:19:36,27
61 And I will bring to light their marvelous works, 

210
00:19:36,27 --> 00:19:41,77
which they did in my name; 

211
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:46,447
62 Yea, and I will also bring to light my 

212
00:19:46,447 --> 00:19:51,114
gospel which was ministered unto them, and, behold, they shall 

213
00:19:51,114 --> 00:19:55,781
not deny that which you have received, but they shall 

214
00:19:55,781 --> 00:20:00,447
build it up, and shall bring to light the true 

215
00:20:00,447 --> 00:20:05,114
points of my doctrine, yea, and the only doctrine which 

216
00:20:05,114 --> 00:20:09,781
is in me. 

217
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:14,875
63 And this I do that I may establish my 

218
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:20,375
gospel, that there may not be so much contention; yea, 

219
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:25,875
Satan doth stir up the hearts of the people to 

220
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:31,375
contention concerning the points of my doctrine; and in these 

221
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:36,875
things they do err, for they do wrest the scriptures 

222
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:42,375
and do not understand them. 

223
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:53,341
64 Therefore, I will unfold unto them this great mystery; 

224
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:59,685
65 For, behold, I will gather them as a hen 

225
00:20:59,685 --> 00:21:06,019
gathereth her chickens under her wings, if they will not 

226
00:21:06,019 --> 00:21:12,352
harden their hearts; 

227
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:18,838
66 Yea, if they will come, they may, and partake 

228
00:21:18,838 --> 00:21:24,838
of the waters of life freely. 

229
00:21:24,35 --> 00:21:29,35
67 Behold, this is my doctrine—whosoever repenteth and cometh unto 

230
00:21:29,35 --> 00:21:34,35
me, the same is my church. 

231
00:21:34,36 --> 00:21:40,36
68 Whosoever declareth more or less than this, the same 

232
00:21:40,36 --> 00:21:46,36
is not of me, but is against me; therefore he 

233
00:21:46,36 --> 00:21:52,36
is not of my church. 

234
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:57,128
69 And now, behold, whosoever is of my church, and 

235
00:21:57,128 --> 00:22:01,378
endureth of my church to the end, him will I 

236
00:22:01,378 --> 00:22:05,628
establish upon my rock, and the gates of hell shall 

237
00:22:05,628 --> 00:22:09,878
not prevail against them. 

238
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:27,511
heading to section 3.) The evil design was to await the 

239
00:00:27,511 --> 00:00:43,511
expected retranslation of the matter covered by the stolen pages 

240
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:59,511
and then to discredit the translator by showing discrepancies created 

241
00:00:59,511 --> 00:01:15,511
by the alterations. That this wicked purpose had been conceived 

242
00:01:15,511 --> 00:01:31,511
by the evil one and was known to the Lord 

243
00:01:31,511 --> 00:01:47,511
even while Mormon, the ancient Nephite historian, was making his 

244
00:01:47,511 --> 00:02:03,511
abridgment of the accumulated plates, is shown in the Book 

245
00:02:03,511 --> 00:02:19,512
of Mormon (see  

246
00:02:19,773 --> 00:04:34,551
Section 10 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet, at 

247
00:04:34,551 --> 00:06:49,329
Harmony, Pennsylvania, likely around April 1829, though portions may have 

248
00:06:49,329 --> 00:09:04,106
been received as early as the summer of 1828. Herein 

249
00:09:04,106 --> 00:11:18,884
the Lord informs Joseph of alterations made by wicked men 

250
00:11:18,884 --> 00:13:33,662
in the 116 manuscript pages from the translation of the 

251
00:13:33,662 --> 00:15:48,44
book of Lehi, in the Book of Mormon. These manuscript 

252
00:15:48,44 --> 00:18:03,217
pages had been lost from the possession of Martin Harris, 

253
00:18:03,217 --> 00:20:17,995
to whom the sheets had been temporarily entrusted. (See the
