1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 10 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Prophet, at Harmony, Pennsylvania, likely around

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
April 1829, though portions may have been received

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
as early as the summer of 1828. Herein the Lord

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
informs Joseph of alterations made by wicked men

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
in the 116 manuscript pages from the translation

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of the book of Lehi, in the Book of Mormon. These

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
manuscript pages had been lost from the

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
possession of Martin Harris, to whom the sheets had been

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
temporarily entrusted. (See the 
heading to

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
section 3.) The evil design was to await the expected

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
retranslation of the matter covered by the stolen

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
pages and then to discredit the translator by

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
showing discrepancies created by the alterations.

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
That this wicked purpose had been conceived by the

16
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
evil one and was known to the Lord even while

17
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Mormon, the ancient Nephite historian, was making

18
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
his abridgment of the accumulated plates, is shown

19
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
in the Book of Mormon (see 
Words of Mormon

20
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
1:3–7). 
1–26, Satan stirs up wicked men to oppose

21
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Lord’s work; 
27–33, He seeks to destroy the

22
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
souls of men; 
34–52, The gospel is to go to the

23
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Lamanites and all nations through the Book of

24
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Mormon; 
53–63, The Lord will establish His Church and

25
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
His gospel among men; 
64–70, He will gather the

26
00:00:00,0 --> 01:35:08,
repentant into His Church and will save the obedient. 

27
01:35:08,0 --> 01:35:08,0
1 Now, behold, I say unto you, that

28
01:35:08,0 --> 01:35:08,0
because you delivered up those writings which

29
01:35:08,0 --> 01:35:08,0
you had power given unto you to translate by

30
01:35:08,0 --> 01:35:08,0
the means of the Urim and Thummim, into

31
01:35:08,0 --> 01:47:19,
the hands of a wicked man, you have lost them.

32
01:47:19,0 --> 01:47:19,0
2 And you also lost your gift at the

33
01:47:19,0 --> 01:51:32,
same time, and your mind became darkened.

34
01:51:32,0 --> 01:51:32,0
3 Nevertheless, it is now restored

35
01:51:32,0 --> 01:51:32,0
unto you again; therefore see that

36
01:51:32,0 --> 01:51:32,0
you are faithful and continue on unto

37
01:51:32,0 --> 01:51:32,0
the finishing of the remainder of

38
01:51:32,0 --> 01:59:44,
the work of translation as you have begun.

39
01:59:44,0 --> 01:59:44,0
4 Do not run faster or labor more

40
01:59:44,0 --> 01:59:44,0
than you have strength and means

41
01:59:44,0 --> 01:59:44,0
provided to enable you to

42
01:59:44,0 --> 02:08:40,
translate; but be diligent unto the end.

43
02:08:40,0 --> 02:08:40,0
5 Pray always, that you may come

44
02:08:40,0 --> 02:08:40,0
off conqueror; yea, that you

45
02:08:40,0 --> 02:08:40,0
may conquer Satan, and that you

46
02:08:40,0 --> 02:08:40,0
may escape the hands of the

47
02:08:40,0 --> 02:19:34,
servants of Satan that do uphold his work.

48
02:19:34,0 --> 02:19:34,0
6 Behold, they have sought

49
02:19:34,0 --> 02:19:34,0
to destroy you; yea, even the

50
02:19:34,0 --> 02:19:34,0
man in whom you have

51
02:19:34,0 --> 02:25:45,
trusted has sought to destroy you.

52
02:25:45,0 --> 02:25:45,0
7 And for this cause I

53
02:25:45,0 --> 02:25:45,0
said that he is a wicked

54
02:25:45,0 --> 02:25:45,0
man, for he has sought

55
02:25:45,0 --> 02:25:45,0
to take away the things

56
02:25:45,0 --> 02:25:45,0
wherewith you have been

57
02:25:45,0 --> 02:25:45,0
entrusted; and he has

58
02:25:45,0 --> 02:33:29,
also sought to destroy your gift.

59
02:33:29,0 --> 02:33:29,0
8 And because you

60
02:33:29,0 --> 02:33:29,0
have delivered the

61
02:33:29,0 --> 02:33:29,0
writings into his hands,

62
02:33:29,0 --> 02:33:29,0
behold, wicked men

63
02:33:29,0 --> 02:40:37,
have taken them from you.

64
02:40:37,0 --> 02:40:37,0
9 Therefore, you

65
02:40:37,0 --> 02:40:37,0
have delivered

66
02:40:37,0 --> 02:40:37,0
them up, yea, that

67
02:40:37,0 --> 02:40:37,0
which was sacred,

68
02:40:37,0 --> 02:46:48,
unto wickedness.

69
02:46:48,0 --> 02:46:48,0
10 And, behold,

70
02:46:48,0 --> 02:46:48,0
Satan hath put

71
02:46:48,0 --> 02:46:48,0
it into their

72
02:46:48,0 --> 02:46:48,0
hearts to alter

73
02:46:48,0 --> 02:46:48,0
the words

74
02:46:48,0 --> 02:46:48,0
which you have

75
02:46:48,0 --> 02:46:48,0
caused to be

76
02:46:48,0 --> 02:46:48,0
written, or which you

77
02:46:48,0 --> 02:46:48,0
have

78
02:46:48,0 --> 02:46:48,0
translated, which have

79
02:46:48,0 --> 02:53:56,
gone out of your hands.

80
02:53:56,0 --> 02:53:56,0
11 And behold,

81
02:53:56,0 --> 02:53:56,0
I say unto

82
02:53:56,0 --> 02:53:56,0
you, that

83
02:53:56,0 --> 02:53:56,0
because they have

84
02:53:56,0 --> 02:53:56,0
altered the

85
02:53:56,0 --> 02:53:56,0
words, they read

86
02:53:56,0 --> 02:53:56,0
contrary from

87
02:53:56,0 --> 02:53:56,0
that which you

88
02:53:56,0 --> 02:53:56,0
translated and

89
02:53:56,0 --> 02:55:08,
caused to be written;

90
02:55:08,0 --> 02:55:08,0
12 And, on

91
02:55:08,0 --> 02:55:08,0
this wise, the

92
02:55:08,0 --> 02:55:08,0
devil has

93
02:55:08,0 --> 02:55:08,0
sought to lay a

94
02:55:08,0 --> 02:55:08,0
cunning plan,

95
02:55:08,0 --> 02:55:08,0
that he may

96
02:55:08,0 --> 03:03:50,
destroy this work;

97
03:03:50,0 --> 03:03:50,0
13 For he

98
03:03:50,0 --> 03:03:50,0
hath put into

99
03:03:50,0 --> 03:03:50,0
their hearts

100
03:03:50,0 --> 03:03:50,0
to do this,

101
03:03:50,0 --> 03:03:50,0
that by

102
03:03:50,0 --> 03:03:50,0
lying they may

103
03:03:50,0 --> 03:03:50,0
say they

104
03:03:50,0 --> 03:03:50,0
have caught you

105
03:03:50,0 --> 03:03:50,0
in the

106
03:03:50,0 --> 03:03:50,0
words which you

107
03:03:50,0 --> 03:03:50,0
have

108
03:03:50,0 --> 03:07:49,
pretended to translate.

109
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
14 Verily, I

110
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
say unto

111
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
you, that I

112
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
will not

113
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
suffer that Satan

114
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
shall

115
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
accomplish his

116
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
evil design in

117
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:21,
this thing.

118
03:07:21,0 --> 03:07:21,0
15 For

119
03:07:21,0 --> 03:07:21,0
behold, he has

120
03:07:21,0 --> 03:07:21,0
put it into

121
03:07:21,0 --> 03:07:21,0
their

122
03:07:21,0 --> 03:07:21,0
hearts to get

123
03:07:21,0 --> 03:07:21,0
thee to

124
03:07:21,0 --> 03:07:21,0
tempt the Lord

125
03:07:21,0 --> 03:07:21,0
thy God, in

126
03:07:21,0 --> 03:07:21,0
asking to

127
03:07:21,0 --> 03:07:21,0
translate

128
03:07:21,0 --> 03:07:35,
it over again.

129
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
16 And

130
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
then, behold,

131
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
they say

132
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
and think

133
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
in their

134
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
hearts—We

135
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
will see if

136
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
God has

137
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
given him

138
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
power to

139
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
translate;

140
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
if so, he

141
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
will also

142
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:49,
give him power again;

143
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
17 And if

144
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
God

145
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
giveth him

146
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
power

147
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
again, or if

148
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
he

149
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
translates

150
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
again, or, in

151
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
other

152
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
words, if he

153
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
bringeth

154
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
forth

155
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
the same

156
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
words,

157
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
behold, we

158
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
have the

159
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
same with

160
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
us, and we

161
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:21,
have altered them;

162
03:07:21,0 --> 03:07:21,0
18

163
03:07:21,0 --> 03:07:21,0
Therefore

164
03:07:21,0 --> 03:07:21,0
they will

165
03:07:21,0 --> 03:07:21,0
not

166
03:07:21,0 --> 03:07:21,0
agree, and we

167
03:07:21,0 --> 03:07:21,0
will

168
03:07:21,0 --> 03:07:21,0
say that

169
03:07:21,0 --> 03:07:21,0
he has

170
03:07:21,0 --> 03:07:21,0
lied in

171
03:07:21,0 --> 03:07:21,0
his words,

172
03:07:21,0 --> 03:07:21,0
and

173
03:07:21,0 --> 03:07:21,0
that he has

174
03:07:21,0 --> 03:07:21,0
no

175
03:07:21,0 --> 03:07:21,0
gift, and

176
03:07:21,0 --> 03:07:35,
that he has no power;

177
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
19

178
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
Therefore

179
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
we will

180
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
destroy

181
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
him,

182
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
and also

183
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
the

184
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
work; and

185
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
we

186
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
will do

187
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
this that

188
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
we may

189
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
not be

190
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0


191
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
ashamed in

192
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
the end,

193
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
and

194
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:35,0
that we

195
03:07:35,0 --> 03:07:49,
may get glory of the world.

196
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
20

197
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
Verily,

198
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
verily,

199
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
I say

200
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
unto

201
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
you,

202
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
that

203
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
Satan

204
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
has

205
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
great hold

206
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
upon

207
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
their

208
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0


209
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
hearts; he

210
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0


211
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
stirreth them

212
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
up to

213
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0


214
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:49,0
iniquity

215
03:07:49,0 --> 03:07:21,
against that which is good;

216
03:07:21,0 --> 03:07:21,0
21 And

217
03:07:21,0 --> 03:07:21,0
their

218
03:07:21,0 --> 03:07:21,0


219
03:07:21,0 --> 03:07:21,0
hearts are

220
03:07:21,0 --> 03:07:21,0


221
03:07:21,0 --> 03:07:21,0
corrupt, and
