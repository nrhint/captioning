1
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:18,163
Section 10 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:18,163 --> 00:00:25,048
 Prophet, at Harmony, Pennsylvania, likely around

3
00:00:25,048 --> 00:00:31,933
 April 1829, though portions may have been received as

4
00:00:31,933 --> 00:00:38,818
 early as the summer of 1828. Herein the Lord

5
00:00:38,818 --> 00:00:45,703
 informs Joseph of alterations made by wicked men in

6
00:00:45,703 --> 00:00:52,588
 the 116 manuscript pages from the translation of the

7
00:00:52,588 --> 00:00:59,473
 book of Lehi, in the Book of Mormon. These

8
00:00:59,473 --> 00:01:06,358
 manuscript pages had been lost from the possession of

9
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:13,243
 Martin Harris, to whom the sheets had been

10
00:01:13,243 --> 00:01:20,128
 temporarily entrusted. (See the 
heading to section 3.) The

11
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:27,013
 evil design was to await the expected

12
00:01:27,013 --> 00:01:33,898
 retranslation of the matter covered by the stolen pages and

13
00:01:33,898 --> 00:01:40,783
 then to discredit the translator by showing

14
00:01:40,783 --> 00:01:47,668
 discrepancies created by the alterations. That this

15
00:01:47,668 --> 00:01:54,553
 wicked purpose had been conceived by the evil one and

16
00:01:54,553 --> 00:02:01,438
 was known to the Lord even while Mormon, the

17
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:08,323
 ancient Nephite historian, was making his abridgment of

18
00:02:08,323 --> 00:02:15,208
 the accumulated plates, is shown in the Book of

19
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:22,093
 Mormon (see 
Words of Mormon 1:3–7). 
1–26, Satan

20
00:02:22,093 --> 00:02:28,978
 stirs up wicked men to oppose the Lord’s work;

21
00:02:28,978 --> 00:02:35,863
27–33, He seeks to destroy the souls of men; 
34–52,

22
00:02:35,863 --> 00:02:42,748
 The gospel is to go to the Lamanites and all

23
00:02:42,748 --> 00:02:49,633
 nations through the Book of Mormon; 
53–63, The Lord

24
00:02:49,633 --> 00:02:56,518
 will establish His Church and His gospel among men;

25
00:02:56,518 --> 00:03:03,403
64–70, He will gather the repentant into His

26
00:03:03,403 --> 00:03:10,288
 Church and will save the obedient.

27
00:03:10,69 --> 00:03:15,69
1 Now, behold, I say unto you, that because you

28
00:03:15,69 --> 00:03:20,69
 delivered up those writings which you had power

29
00:03:20,69 --> 00:03:25,69
 given unto you to translate by the means of the Urim

30
00:03:25,69 --> 00:03:30,69
 and Thummim, into the hands of a wicked man, you

31
00:03:30,69 --> 00:03:35,69
 have lost them

32
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:40,182
2 And you also lost your gift at the same time,

33
00:03:40,182 --> 00:03:44,682
 and your mind became darkened

34
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:48,507
3 Nevertheless, it is now restored unto you again;

35
00:03:48,507 --> 00:03:52,757
 therefore see that you are faithful and continue

36
00:03:52,757 --> 00:03:57,007
 on unto the finishing of the remainder of the work

37
00:03:57,007 --> 00:04:01,257
 of translation as you have begun

38
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:06,941
4 Do not run faster or labor more than you have

39
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:12,608
 strength and means provided to enable you to

40
00:04:12,608 --> 00:04:18,275
 translate; but be diligent unto the end

41
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:23,558
5 Pray always, that you may come off conqueror;

42
00:04:23,558 --> 00:04:29,058
 yea, that you may conquer Satan, and that you may

43
00:04:29,058 --> 00:04:34,558
 escape the hands of the servants of Satan that do

44
00:04:34,558 --> 00:04:40,058
 uphold his work

45
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:44,013
6 Behold, they have sought to destroy you; yea,

46
00:04:44,013 --> 00:04:48,013
 even the man in whom you have trusted has sought to

47
00:04:48,013 --> 00:04:52,013
 destroy you

48
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:56,309
7 And for this cause I said that he is a wicked

49
00:04:56,309 --> 00:05:00,059
 man, for he has sought to take away the things

50
00:05:00,059 --> 00:05:03,809
 wherewith you have been entrusted; and he has also

51
00:05:03,809 --> 00:05:07,559
 sought to destroy your gift

52
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:13,474
8 And because you have delivered the writings into

53
00:05:13,474 --> 00:05:19,142
 his hands, behold, wicked men have taken them

54
00:05:19,142 --> 00:05:24,808
 from you

55
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:29,357
9 Therefore, you have delivered them up, yea, that

56
00:05:29,357 --> 00:05:34,357
 which was sacred, unto wickedness

57
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:39,901
10 And, behold, Satan hath put it into their

58
00:05:39,901 --> 00:05:44,901
 hearts to alter the words which you have caused to be

59
00:05:44,901 --> 00:05:49,901
 written, or which you have translated, which have

60
00:05:49,901 --> 00:05:54,901
 gone out of your hands

61
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:59,487
11 And behold, I say unto you, that because they

62
00:05:59,487 --> 00:06:04,82
 have altered the words, they read contrary from

63
00:06:04,82 --> 00:06:10,153
 that which you translated and caused to be written

64
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:15,204
12 And, on this wise, the devil has sought to lay

65
00:06:15,204 --> 00:06:19,704
 a cunning plan, that he may destroy this work

66
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:25,213
13 For he hath put into their hearts to do this,

67
00:06:25,213 --> 00:06:30,88
 that by lying they may say they have caught you in

68
00:06:30,88 --> 00:06:36,547
 the words which you have pretended to translate

69
00:06:36,83 --> 00:06:40,497
14 Verily, I say unto you, that I will not suffer

70
00:06:40,497 --> 00:06:44,164
 that Satan shall accomplish his evil design in

71
00:06:44,164 --> 00:06:47,831
 this thing

72
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:52,274
15 For behold, he has put it into their hearts to

73
00:06:52,274 --> 00:06:56,941
 get thee to tempt the Lord thy God, in asking to

74
00:06:56,941 --> 00:07:01,608
 translate it over again

75
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:04,104
16 And then, behold, they say and think in their

76
00:07:04,104 --> 00:07:06,854
 hearts—We will see if God has given him power to

77
00:07:06,854 --> 00:07:09,604
 translate; if so, he will also give him power again

78
00:07:09,604 --> 00:07:12,354


79
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:16,866
17 And if God giveth him power again, or if he

80
00:07:16,866 --> 00:07:20,866
 translates again, or, in other words, if he bringeth

81
00:07:20,866 --> 00:07:24,866
 forth the same words, behold, we have the same

82
00:07:24,866 --> 00:07:28,866
 with us, and we have altered them

83
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:33,781
18 Therefore they will not agree, and we will say

84
00:07:33,781 --> 00:07:39,448
 that he has lied in his words, and that he has no

85
00:07:39,448 --> 00:07:45,115
 gift, and that he has no power

86
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:49,631
19 Therefore we will destroy him, and also the

87
00:07:49,631 --> 00:07:54,131
 work; and we will do this that we may not be ashamed

88
00:07:54,131 --> 00:07:58,631
 in the end, and that we may get glory of the

89
00:07:58,631 --> 00:08:03,131
 world

90
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:07,416
20 Verily, verily, I say unto you, that Satan has

91
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:11,416
 great hold upon their hearts; he stirreth them up

92
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:15,416
 to iniquity against that which is good

93
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:20,145
21 And their hearts are corrupt, and full of

94
00:08:20,145 --> 00:08:24,895
 wickedness and abominations; and they love darkness

95
00:08:24,895 --> 00:08:29,645
 rather than light, because their deeds are evil;

96
00:08:29,645 --> 00:08:34,395
 therefore they will not ask of me

97
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:37,881
22 Satan stirreth them up, that he may lead their

98
00:08:37,881 --> 00:08:41,381
 souls to destruction

99
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:48,388
23 And thus he has laid a cunning plan, thinking

100
00:08:48,388 --> 00:08:54,888
 to destroy the work of God; but I will require this

101
00:08:54,888 --> 00:09:01,388
 at their hands, and it shall turn to their shame

102
00:09:01,388 --> 00:09:07,888
 and condemnation in the day of judgment

103
00:09:07,38 --> 00:09:10,88
24 Yea, he stirreth up their hearts to anger

104
00:09:10,88 --> 00:09:14,38
 against this work

105
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:20,088
25 Yea, he saith unto them: Deceive and lie in

106
00:09:20,088 --> 00:09:25,288
 wait to catch, that ye may destroy; behold, this is

107
00:09:25,288 --> 00:09:30,488
 no harm. And thus he flattereth them, and telleth

108
00:09:30,488 --> 00:09:35,688
 them that it is no sin to lie that they may catch a

109
00:09:35,688 --> 00:09:40,888
 man in a lie, that they may destroy him

110
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:45,847
26 And thus he flattereth them, and leadeth them

111
00:09:45,847 --> 00:09:50,847
 along until he draggeth their souls down to hell;

112
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:55,847
 and thus he causeth them to catch themselves in

113
00:09:55,847 --> 00:10:00,847
 their own snare

114
00:10:00,1 --> 00:10:06,1
27 And thus he goeth up and down, to and fro in

115
00:10:06,1 --> 00:10:12,1
 the earth, seeking to destroy the souls of men

116
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:16,578
28 Verily, verily, I say unto you, wo be unto him

117
00:10:16,578 --> 00:10:21,078
 that lieth to deceive because he supposeth that

118
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:25,578
 another lieth to deceive, for such are not exempt

119
00:10:25,578 --> 00:10:30,078
 from the justice of God

120
00:10:30,63 --> 00:10:36,88
29 Now, behold, they have altered these words,

121
00:10:36,88 --> 00:10:43,13
 because Satan saith unto them: He hath deceived

122
00:10:43,13 --> 00:10:49,38
 you—and thus he flattereth them away to do iniquity, to

123
00:10:49,38 --> 00:10:55,63
 get thee to tempt the Lord thy God

124
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:58,487
30 Behold, I say unto you, that you shall not

125
00:10:58,487 --> 00:11:01,821
 translate again those words which have gone forth out

126
00:11:01,821 --> 00:11:05,154
 of your hands

127
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:10,198
31 For, behold, they shall not accomplish their

128
00:11:10,198 --> 00:11:14,698
 evil designs in lying against those words. For,

129
00:11:14,698 --> 00:11:19,198
 behold, if you should bring forth the same words they

130
00:11:19,198 --> 00:11:23,698
 will say that you have lied and that you have

131
00:11:23,698 --> 00:11:28,198
 pretended to translate, but that you have contradicted

132
00:11:28,198 --> 00:11:32,698
 yourself

133
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:37,192
32 And, behold, they will publish this, and Satan

134
00:11:37,192 --> 00:11:42,192
 will harden the hearts of the people to stir them

135
00:11:42,192 --> 00:11:47,192
 up to anger against you, that they will not

136
00:11:47,192 --> 00:11:52,192
 believe my words

137
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:57,478
33 Thus Satan thinketh to overpower your testimony

138
00:11:57,478 --> 00:12:02,811
 in this generation, that the work may not come

139
00:12:02,811 --> 00:12:08,144
 forth in this generation

140
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:12,294
34 But behold, here is wisdom, and because I show

141
00:12:12,294 --> 00:12:16,494
 unto you wisdom, and give you commandments

142
00:12:16,494 --> 00:12:20,694
 concerning these things, what you shall do, show it not

143
00:12:20,694 --> 00:12:24,894
 unto the world until you have accomplished the work

144
00:12:24,894 --> 00:12:29,094
 of translation

145
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:36,249
35 Marvel not that I said unto you: Here is

146
00:12:36,249 --> 00:12:42,916
 wisdom, show it not unto the world—for I said, show it

147
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:49,583
 not unto the world, that you may be preserved

148
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:52,068
36 Behold, I do not say that you shall not show it

149
00:12:52,068 --> 00:12:55,068
 unto the righteous

150
00:12:55,608 --> 00:13:01,408
37 But as you cannot always judge the righteous,

151
00:13:01,408 --> 00:13:07,208
 or as you cannot always tell the wicked from the

152
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:13,008
 righteous, therefore I say unto you, hold your peace

153
00:13:13,008 --> 00:13:18,808
 until I shall see fit to make all things known

154
00:13:18,808 --> 00:13:24,608
 unto the world concerning the matter

155
00:13:24,17 --> 00:13:27,67
38 And now, verily I say unto you, that an account

156
00:13:27,67 --> 00:13:31,17
 of those things that you have written, which have

157
00:13:31,17 --> 00:13:34,67
 gone out of your hands, is engraven upon the

158
00:13:34,67 --> 00:13:38,17
 plates of Nephi

159
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:43,251
39 Yea, and you remember it was said in those

160
00:13:43,251 --> 00:13:47,584
 writings that a more particular account was given of

161
00:13:47,584 --> 00:13:51,917
 these things upon the plates of Nephi

162
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:55,198
40 And now, because the account which is engraven

163
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:58,698
 upon the plates of Nephi is more particular

164
00:13:58,698 --> 00:14:02,198
 concerning the things which, in my wisdom, I would bring

165
00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:05,698
 to the knowledge of the people in this account

166
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:09,878
41 Therefore, you shall translate the engravings

167
00:14:09,878 --> 00:14:14,078
 which are on the plates of Nephi, down even till

168
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:18,278
 you come to the reign of king Benjamin, or until you

169
00:14:18,278 --> 00:14:22,478
 come to that which you have translated, which you

170
00:14:22,478 --> 00:14:26,678
 have retained

171
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:31,999
42 And behold, you shall publish it as the record

172
00:14:31,999 --> 00:14:37,332
 of Nephi; and thus I will confound those who have

173
00:14:37,332 --> 00:14:42,665
 altered my words

174
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:47,382
43 I will not suffer that they shall destroy my

175
00:14:47,382 --> 00:14:52,049
 work; yea, I will show unto them that my wisdom is

176
00:14:52,049 --> 00:14:56,716
 greater than the cunning of the devil

177
00:14:56,996 --> 00:15:02,996
44 Behold, they have only got a part, or an

178
00:15:02,996 --> 00:15:08,996
 abridgment of the account of Nephi

179
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:11,708
45 Behold, there are many things engraven upon the

180
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:14,908
 plates of Nephi which do throw greater views upon

181
00:15:14,908 --> 00:15:18,108
 my gospel; therefore, it is wisdom in me that you

182
00:15:18,108 --> 00:15:21,308
 should translate this first part of the

183
00:15:21,308 --> 00:15:24,508
 engravings of Nephi, and send forth in this work

184
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:30,657
46 And, behold, all the remainder of this work

185
00:15:30,657 --> 00:15:36,857
 does contain all those parts of my gospel which my

186
00:15:36,857 --> 00:15:43,057
 holy prophets, yea, and also my disciples, desired

187
00:15:43,057 --> 00:15:49,257
 in their prayers should come forth unto this

188
00:15:49,257 --> 00:15:55,457
 people

189
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:58,154
47 And I said unto them, that it should be granted

190
00:15:58,154 --> 00:16:01,154
 unto them according to their faith in their

191
00:16:01,154 --> 00:16:04,154
 prayers

192
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:09,697
48 Yea, and this was their faith—that my gospel,

193
00:16:09,697 --> 00:16:14,697
 which I gave unto them that they might preach in

194
00:16:14,697 --> 00:16:19,697
 their days, might come unto their brethren the

195
00:16:19,697 --> 00:16:24,697
 Lamanites, and also all that had become Lamanites

196
00:16:24,697 --> 00:16:29,697
 because of their dissensions

197
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:33,956
49 Now, this is not all—their faith in their

198
00:16:33,956 --> 00:16:37,956
 prayers was that this gospel should be made known also,

199
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:41,956
 if it were possible that other nations should

200
00:16:41,956 --> 00:16:45,956
 possess this land

201
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:49,171
50 And thus they did leave a blessing upon this

202
00:16:49,171 --> 00:16:52,671
 land in their prayers, that whosoever should believe

203
00:16:52,671 --> 00:16:56,171
 in this gospel in this land might have eternal

204
00:16:56,171 --> 00:16:59,671
 life

205
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:02,652
51 Yea, that it might be free unto all of

206
00:17:02,652 --> 00:17:05,652
 whatsoever nation, kindred, tongue, or people they may be

207
00:17:05,652 --> 00:17:08,652


208
00:17:08,06 --> 00:17:13,46
52 And now, behold, according to their faith in

209
00:17:13,46 --> 00:17:18,86
 their prayers will I bring this part of my gospel to

210
00:17:18,86 --> 00:17:24,26
 the knowledge of my people. Behold, I do not

211
00:17:24,26 --> 00:17:29,66
 bring it to destroy that which they have received, but

212
00:17:29,66 --> 00:17:35,06
 to build it up

213
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:38,688
53 And for this cause have I said: If this

214
00:17:38,688 --> 00:17:42,355
 generation harden not their hearts, I will establish my

215
00:17:42,355 --> 00:17:46,022
 church among them

216
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:51,999
54 Now I do not say this to destroy my church, but

217
00:17:51,999 --> 00:17:56,999
 I say this to build up my church

218
00:17:56,776 --> 00:18:00,776
55 Therefore, whosoever belongeth to my church

219
00:18:00,776 --> 00:18:04,776
 need not fear, for such shall inherit the kingdom of

220
00:18:04,776 --> 00:18:08,776
 heaven

221
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:13,664
56 But it is they who do not fear me, neither keep

222
00:18:13,664 --> 00:18:18,807
 my commandments but build up churches unto

223
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:23,95
 themselves to get gain, yea, and all those that do

224
00:18:23,95 --> 00:18:29,093
 wickedly and build up the kingdom of the devil—yea,

225
00:18:29,093 --> 00:18:34,236
 verily, verily, I say unto you, that it is they that

226
00:18:34,236 --> 00:18:39,379
 I will disturb, and cause to tremble and shake to

227
00:18:39,379 --> 00:18:44,522
 the center

228
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:50,257
57 Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I

229
00:18:50,257 --> 00:18:55,757
 came unto mine own, and mine own received me not

230
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:59,768
58 I am the light which shineth in darkness, and

231
00:18:59,768 --> 00:19:03,768
 the darkness comprehendeth it not

232
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:08,275
59 I am he who said—Other sheep have I which are

233
00:19:08,275 --> 00:19:13,275
 not of this fold—unto my disciples, and many there

234
00:19:13,275 --> 00:19:18,275
 were that understood me not

235
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:22,758
60 And I will show unto this people that I had

236
00:19:22,758 --> 00:19:26,758
 other sheep, and that they were a branch of the house

237
00:19:26,758 --> 00:19:30,758
 of Jacob

238
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:36,036
61 And I will bring to light their marvelous

239
00:19:36,036 --> 00:19:41,536
 works, which they did in my name

240
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:46,481
62 Yea, and I will also bring to light my gospel

241
00:19:46,481 --> 00:19:51,148
 which was ministered unto them, and, behold, they

242
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:55,815
 shall not deny that which you have received, but

243
00:19:55,815 --> 00:20:00,482
 they shall build it up, and shall bring to light the

244
00:20:00,482 --> 00:20:05,149
 true points of my doctrine, yea, and the only

245
00:20:05,149 --> 00:20:09,816
 doctrine which is in me

246
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:14,908
63 And this I do that I may establish my gospel,

247
00:20:14,908 --> 00:20:20,408
 that there may not be so much contention; yea,

248
00:20:20,408 --> 00:20:25,908
 Satan doth stir up the hearts of the people to

249
00:20:25,908 --> 00:20:31,408
 contention concerning the points of my doctrine; and in

250
00:20:31,408 --> 00:20:36,908
 these things they do err, for they do wrest the

251
00:20:36,908 --> 00:20:42,408
 scriptures and do not understand them

252
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:47,641
64 Therefore, I will unfold unto them this great

253
00:20:47,641 --> 00:20:53,141
 mystery

254
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:59,485
65 For, behold, I will gather them as a hen

255
00:20:59,485 --> 00:21:05,818
 gathereth her chickens under her wings, if they will not

256
00:21:05,818 --> 00:21:12,151
 harden their hearts

257
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:18,872
66 Yea, if they will come, they may, and partake

258
00:21:18,872 --> 00:21:24,872
 of the waters of life freely

259
00:21:24,15 --> 00:21:29,15
67 Behold, this is my doctrine—whosoever repenteth

260
00:21:29,15 --> 00:21:34,15
 and cometh unto me, the same is my church

261
00:21:34,16 --> 00:21:40,16
68 Whosoever declareth more or less than this, the

262
00:21:40,16 --> 00:21:46,16
 same is not of me, but is against me; therefore

263
00:21:46,16 --> 00:21:52,16
 he is not of my church

264
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:56,928
69 And now, behold, whosoever is of my church, and

265
00:21:56,928 --> 00:22:01,178
 endureth of my church to the end, him will I

266
00:22:01,178 --> 00:22:05,428
 establish upon my rock, and the gates of hell shall

267
00:22:05,428 --> 00:22:09,678
 not prevail against them

268
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:15,028
70 And now, remember the words of him who is the

269
00:22:15,028 --> 00:22:20,361
 life and light of the world, your Redeemer, your

270
00:22:20,361 --> 00:22:25,694
 Lord and your God. Amen.
