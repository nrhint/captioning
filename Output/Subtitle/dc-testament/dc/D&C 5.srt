00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:21,083
Section 5 Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at 

2
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:30,654
Harmony, Pennsylvania, March 1829, at the request of Martin Harris. 

3
00:00:30,654 --> 00:00:40,226

1–10, This generation will receive the Lord’s word through Joseph 

4
00:00:40,226 --> 00:00:49,797
Smith; 
11–18, Three witnesses will testify of the Book of 

5
00:00:49,797 --> 00:00:59,369
Mormon; 
19–20, The word of the Lord will be verified 

6
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:08,94
as in previous times; 
21–35, Martin Harris may repent and 

7
00:01:08,94 --> 00:01:18,511
be one of the witnesses.  

8
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:23,412
1 Behold, I say unto you, that as my servant 

9
00:01:23,412 --> 00:01:28,412
Martin Harris has desired a witness at my hand, that 

10
00:01:28,412 --> 00:01:33,412
you, my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., have got the plates 

11
00:01:33,412 --> 00:01:38,412
of which you have testified and borne record that you 

12
00:01:38,412 --> 00:01:43,412
have received of me; 

13
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:50,003
2 And now, behold, this shall you say unto him—he 

14
00:01:50,003 --> 00:01:56,603
who spake unto you, said unto you: I, the Lord, 

15
00:01:56,603 --> 00:02:03,203
am God, and have given these things unto you, my 

16
00:02:03,203 --> 00:02:09,803
servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and have commanded you that you 

17
00:02:09,803 --> 00:02:16,403
should stand as a witness of these things; 

18
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:22,003
3 And I have caused you that you should enter 

19
00:02:22,003 --> 00:02:27,603
into a covenant with me, that you should not show 

20
00:02:27,603 --> 00:02:33,203
them except to those persons to whom I commanded you; 

21
00:02:33,203 --> 00:02:38,803
and you have no power over them except I grant 

22
00:02:38,803 --> 00:02:44,403
it unto you. 

23
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:50,065
4 And you have a gift to translate the plates; 

24
00:02:50,065 --> 00:02:55,231
and this is the first gift that I bestowed upon 

25
00:02:55,231 --> 00:03:00,398
you; and I have commanded that you should pretend to 

26
00:03:00,398 --> 00:03:05,565
no other gift until my purpose is fulfilled in this; 

27
00:03:05,565 --> 00:03:10,731
for I will grant unto you no other gift until 

28
00:03:10,731 --> 00:03:15,898
it is finished. 

29
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:20,362
5 Verily, I say unto you, that woe shall come 

30
00:03:20,362 --> 00:03:25,362
unto the inhabitants of the earth if they will not 

31
00:03:25,362 --> 00:03:30,362
hearken unto my words; 

32
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:36,843
6 For hereafter you shall be ordained and go forth 

33
00:03:36,843 --> 00:03:43,343
and deliver my words unto the children of men. 

34
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:49,207
7 Behold, if they will not believe my words, they 

35
00:03:49,207 --> 00:03:54,457
would not believe you, my servant Joseph, if it were 

36
00:03:54,457 --> 00:03:59,707
possible that you should show them all these things which 

37
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:04,957
I have committed unto you. 

38
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:13,945
8 Oh, this unbelieving and stiffnecked generation—mine anger is kindled 

39
00:04:13,945 --> 00:04:22,945
against them. 

40
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:28,278
9 Behold, verily I say unto you, I have reserved 

41
00:04:28,278 --> 00:04:34,528
those things which I have entrusted unto you, my servant 

42
00:04:34,528 --> 00:04:40,778
Joseph, for a wise purpose in me, and it shall 

43
00:04:40,778 --> 00:04:47,028
be made known unto future generations; 

44
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:58,988
10 But this generation shall have my word through you; 

45
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:03,532
11 And in addition to your testimony, the testimony of 

46
00:05:03,532 --> 00:05:08,532
three of my servants, whom I shall call and ordain, 

47
00:05:08,532 --> 00:05:13,532
unto whom I will show these things, and they shall 

48
00:05:13,532 --> 00:05:18,532
go forth with my words that are given through you. 

49
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:24,684
12 Yea, they shall know of a surety that these 

50
00:05:24,684 --> 00:05:31,351
things are true, for from heaven will I declare it 

51
00:05:31,351 --> 00:05:38,018
unto them. 

52
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:44,538
13 I will give them power that they may behold 

53
00:05:44,538 --> 00:05:50,538
and view these things as they are; 

54
00:05:50,05 --> 00:05:56,883
14 And to none else will I grant this power, 

55
00:05:56,883 --> 00:06:03,716
to receive this same testimony among this generation, in this 

56
00:06:03,716 --> 00:06:10,55
the beginning of the rising up and the coming forth 

57
00:06:10,55 --> 00:06:17,383
of my church out of the wilderness—clear as the moon, 

58
00:06:17,383 --> 00:06:24,216
and fair as the sun, and terrible as an army 

59
00:06:24,216 --> 00:06:31,05
with banners. 

60
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:37,492
15 And the testimony of three witnesses will I send 

61
00:06:37,492 --> 00:06:42,992
forth of my word. 

62
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:47,502
16 And behold, whosoever believeth on my words, them will 

63
00:06:47,502 --> 00:06:53,002
I visit with the manifestation of my Spirit; and they 

64
00:06:53,002 --> 00:06:58,502
shall be born of me, even of water and of 

65
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:04,002
the Spirit— 

66
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:09,491
17 And you must wait yet a little while, for 

67
00:07:09,491 --> 00:07:14,491
ye are not yet ordained— 

68
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:19,834
18 And their testimony shall also go forth unto the 

69
00:07:19,834 --> 00:07:25,167
condemnation of this generation if they harden their hearts against 

70
00:07:25,167 --> 00:07:30,501
them; 

71
00:07:30,45 --> 00:07:37,25
19 For a desolating scourge shall go forth among the 

72
00:07:37,25 --> 00:07:44,05
inhabitants of the earth, and shall continue to be poured 

73
00:07:44,05 --> 00:07:50,85
out from time to time, if they repent not, until 

74
00:07:50,85 --> 00:07:57,65
the earth is empty, and the inhabitants thereof are consumed 

75
00:07:57,65 --> 00:08:04,45
away and utterly destroyed by the brightness of my coming. 

76
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:10,384
20 Behold, I tell you these things, even as I 

77
00:08:10,384 --> 00:08:16,384
also told the people of the destruction of Jerusalem; and 

78
00:08:16,384 --> 00:08:22,384
my word shall be verified at this time as it 

79
00:08:22,384 --> 00:08:28,384
hath hitherto been verified. 

80
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:34,908
21 And now I command you, my servant Joseph, to 

81
00:08:34,908 --> 00:08:40,908
repent and walk more uprightly before me, and to yield 

82
00:08:40,908 --> 00:08:46,908
to the persuasions of men no more; 

83
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:48,893
22 And that you be firm in keeping the commandments 

84
00:08:48,893 --> 00:08:50,893
wherewith I have commanded you; and if you do this, 

85
00:08:50,893 --> 00:08:52,893
behold I grant unto you eternal life, even if you 

86
00:08:52,893 --> 00:08:54,893
should be slain. 

87
00:08:54,868 --> 00:09:04,868
23 And now, again, I speak unto you, my servant 

88
00:09:04,868 --> 00:09:14,868
Joseph, concerning the man that desires the witness— 

89
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:19,354
24 Behold, I say unto him, he exalts himself and 

90
00:09:19,354 --> 00:09:24,354
does not humble himself sufficiently before me; but if he 

91
00:09:24,354 --> 00:09:29,354
will bow down before me, and humble himself in mighty 

92
00:09:29,354 --> 00:09:34,354
prayer and faith, in the sincerity of his heart, then 

93
00:09:34,354 --> 00:09:39,354
will I grant unto him a view of the things 

94
00:09:39,354 --> 00:09:44,354
which he desires to see. 

95
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:49,818
25 And then he shall say unto the people of 

96
00:09:49,818 --> 00:09:54,818
this generation: Behold, I have seen the things which the 

97
00:09:54,818 --> 00:09:59,818
Lord hath shown unto Joseph Smith, Jun., and I know 

98
00:09:59,818 --> 00:10:04,818
of a surety that they are true, for I have 

99
00:10:04,818 --> 00:10:09,818
seen them, for they have been shown unto me by 

100
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:14,818
the power of God and not of man. 

101
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:18,914
26 And I the Lord command him, my servant Martin 

102
00:10:18,914 --> 00:10:23,081
Harris, that he shall say no more unto them concerning 

103
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:27,247
these things, except he shall say: I have seen them, 

104
00:10:27,247 --> 00:10:31,414
and they have been shown unto me by the power 

105
00:10:31,414 --> 00:10:35,581
of God; and these are the words which he shall 

106
00:10:35,581 --> 00:10:39,747
say. 

107
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:43,605
27 But if he deny this he will break the 

108
00:10:43,605 --> 00:10:47,939
covenant which he has before covenanted with me, and behold, 

109
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:52,272
he is condemned. 

110
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:57,814
28 And now, except he humble himself and acknowledge unto 

111
00:10:57,814 --> 00:11:03,242
me the things that he has done which are wrong, 

112
00:11:03,242 --> 00:11:08,671
and covenant with me that he will keep my commandments, 

113
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:14,099
and exercise faith in me, behold, I say unto him, 

114
00:11:14,099 --> 00:11:19,528
he shall have no such views, for I will grant 

115
00:11:19,528 --> 00:11:24,956
unto him no views of the things of which I 

116
00:11:24,956 --> 00:11:30,385
have spoken. 

117
00:11:30,29 --> 00:11:34,29
29 And if this be the case, I command you, 

118
00:11:34,29 --> 00:11:38,29
my servant Joseph, that you shall say unto him, that 

119
00:11:38,29 --> 00:11:42,29
he shall do no more, nor trouble me any more 

120
00:11:42,29 --> 00:11:46,29
concerning this matter. 

121
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:51,239
30 And if this be the case, behold, I say 

122
00:11:51,239 --> 00:11:56,239
unto thee Joseph, when thou hast translated a few more 

123
00:11:56,239 --> 00:12:01,239
pages thou shalt stop for a season, even until I 

124
00:12:01,239 --> 00:12:06,239
command thee again; then thou mayest translate again. 

125
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:11,559
31 And except thou do this, behold, thou shalt have 

126
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:16,892
no more gift, and I will take away the things 

127
00:12:16,892 --> 00:12:22,226
which I have entrusted with thee. 

128
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:30,025
32 And now, because I foresee the lying in wait 

129
00:12:30,025 --> 00:12:37,275
to destroy thee, yea, I foresee that if my servant 

130
00:12:37,275 --> 00:12:44,525
Martin Harris humbleth not himself and receive a witness from 

131
00:12:44,525 --> 00:12:51,775
my hand, that he will fall into transgression; 

132
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:55,738
33 And there are many that lie in wait to 

133
00:12:55,738 --> 00:12:59,738
destroy thee from off the face of the earth; and 

134
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:03,738
for this cause, that thy days may be prolonged, I 

135
00:13:03,738 --> 00:13:07,738
have given unto thee these commandments. 

136
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:11,687
34 Yea, for this cause I have said: Stop, and 

137
00:13:11,687 --> 00:13:15,687
stand still until I command thee, and I will provide 

138
00:13:15,687 --> 00:13:19,687
means whereby thou mayest accomplish the thing which I have 

139
00:13:19,687 --> 00:13:23,687
commanded thee. 

140
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:28,836
35 And if thou art faithful in keeping my commandments, 

141
00:13:28,836 --> 00:13:34,502
thou shalt be lifted up at the last day. Amen. 

142
00:13:34,502 --> 00:13:40,169
