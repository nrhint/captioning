00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 5 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Prophet, at Harmony, Pennsylvania, March 1829,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
at the request of Martin Harris. 
1–10, This

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
generation will receive the Lord’s word through

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Joseph Smith; 
11–18, Three witnesses will testify of

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Book of Mormon; 
19–20, The word of the Lord

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
will be verified as in previous times; 
21–35,

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:39:22,
Martin Harris may repent and be one of the witnesses. 

9
00:39:22,0 --> 00:39:22,0
1 Behold, I say unto you, that as my servant

10
00:39:22,0 --> 00:39:22,0
Martin Harris has desired a witness at my

11
00:39:22,0 --> 00:39:22,0
hand, that you, my servant Joseph Smith, Jun.,

12
00:39:22,0 --> 00:39:22,0
have got the plates of which you have

13
00:39:22,0 --> 00:49:32,
testified and borne record that you have received of me;

14
00:49:32,0 --> 00:49:32,0
2 And now, behold, this shall you say

15
00:49:32,0 --> 00:49:32,0
unto him—he who spake unto you, said unto

16
00:49:32,0 --> 00:49:32,0
you: I, the Lord, am God, and have given

17
00:49:32,0 --> 00:49:32,0
these things unto you, my servant Joseph

18
00:49:32,0 --> 00:49:32,0
Smith, Jun., and have commanded you that

19
00:49:32,0 --> 00:50:44,
you should stand as a witness of these things;

20
00:50:44,0 --> 00:50:44,0
3 And I have caused you that you

21
00:50:44,0 --> 00:50:44,0
should enter into a covenant with

22
00:50:44,0 --> 00:50:44,0
me, that you should not show them

23
00:50:44,0 --> 00:50:44,0
except to those persons to whom I

24
00:50:44,0 --> 00:50:44,0
commanded you; and you have no

25
00:50:44,0 --> 01:07:52,
power over them except I grant it unto you.

26
01:07:52,0 --> 01:07:52,0
4 And you have a gift to

27
01:07:52,0 --> 01:07:52,0
translate the plates; and this is the

28
01:07:52,0 --> 01:07:52,0
first gift that I bestowed upon

29
01:07:52,0 --> 01:07:52,0
you; and I have commanded that

30
01:07:52,0 --> 01:07:52,0
you should pretend to no other

31
01:07:52,0 --> 01:07:52,0
gift until my purpose is fulfilled

32
01:07:52,0 --> 01:07:52,0
in this; for I will grant unto

33
01:07:52,0 --> 01:21:01,
you no other gift until it is finished.

34
01:21:01,0 --> 01:21:01,0
5 Verily, I say unto you,

35
01:21:01,0 --> 01:21:01,0
that woe shall come unto the

36
01:21:01,0 --> 01:21:01,0
inhabitants of the earth if they

37
01:21:01,0 --> 01:37:11,
will not hearken unto my words;

38
01:37:11,0 --> 01:37:11,0
6 For hereafter you

39
01:37:11,0 --> 01:37:11,0
shall be ordained and go

40
01:37:11,0 --> 01:37:11,0
forth and deliver my words

41
01:37:11,0 --> 01:44:55,
unto the children of men.

42
01:44:55,0 --> 01:44:55,0
7 Behold, if they will

43
01:44:55,0 --> 01:44:55,0
not believe my words,

44
01:44:55,0 --> 01:44:55,0
they would not believe

45
01:44:55,0 --> 01:44:55,0
you, my servant Joseph,

46
01:44:55,0 --> 01:44:55,0
if it were possible

47
01:44:55,0 --> 01:44:55,0
that you should show them

48
01:44:55,0 --> 01:44:55,0
all these things which

49
01:44:55,0 --> 01:51:06,
I have committed unto you.

50
01:51:06,0 --> 01:51:06,0
8 Oh, this

51
01:51:06,0 --> 01:51:06,0
unbelieving and stiffnecked

52
01:51:06,0 --> 01:51:06,0
generation—mine anger is

53
01:51:06,0 --> 02:02:00,
kindled against them.

54
02:02:00,0 --> 02:02:00,0
9 Behold, verily I

55
02:02:00,0 --> 02:02:00,0
say unto you, I

56
02:02:00,0 --> 02:02:00,0
have reserved those

57
02:02:00,0 --> 02:02:00,0
things which I have

58
02:02:00,0 --> 02:02:00,0
entrusted unto you,

59
02:02:00,0 --> 02:02:00,0
my servant Joseph,

60
02:02:00,0 --> 02:02:00,0
for a wise purpose

61
02:02:00,0 --> 02:02:00,0
in me, and it shall

62
02:02:00,0 --> 02:02:00,0
be made known unto

63
02:02:00,0 --> 02:10:12,
future generations;

64
02:10:12,0 --> 02:10:12,0
10 But this

65
02:10:12,0 --> 02:10:12,0
generation shall have my

66
02:10:12,0 --> 02:23:21,
word through you;

67
02:23:21,0 --> 02:23:21,0
11 And in

68
02:23:21,0 --> 02:23:21,0
addition to your

69
02:23:21,0 --> 02:23:21,0
testimony, the testimony

70
02:23:21,0 --> 02:23:21,0
of three of my

71
02:23:21,0 --> 02:23:21,0
servants, whom I

72
02:23:21,0 --> 02:23:21,0
shall call and

73
02:23:21,0 --> 02:23:21,0
ordain, unto whom I

74
02:23:21,0 --> 02:23:21,0
will show these

75
02:23:21,0 --> 02:23:21,0
things, and they

76
02:23:21,0 --> 02:23:21,0
shall go forth

77
02:23:21,0 --> 02:23:21,0
with my words that

78
02:23:21,0 --> 02:28:32,
are given through you.

79
02:28:32,0 --> 02:28:32,0
12 Yea, they

80
02:28:32,0 --> 02:28:32,0
shall know of a

81
02:28:32,0 --> 02:28:32,0
surety that

82
02:28:32,0 --> 02:28:32,0
these things are

83
02:28:32,0 --> 02:28:32,0
true, for from

84
02:28:32,0 --> 02:28:32,0
heaven will I

85
02:28:32,0 --> 02:37:42,
declare it unto them.

86
02:37:42,0 --> 02:37:42,0
13 I will

87
02:37:42,0 --> 02:37:42,0
give them power

88
02:37:42,0 --> 02:37:42,0
that they may

89
02:37:42,0 --> 02:37:42,0
behold and

90
02:37:42,0 --> 02:37:42,0
view these

91
02:37:42,0 --> 02:40:52,
things as they are;

92
02:40:52,0 --> 02:40:52,0
14 And to

93
02:40:52,0 --> 02:40:52,0
none else will

94
02:40:52,0 --> 02:40:52,0
I grant

95
02:40:52,0 --> 02:40:52,0
this power, to

96
02:40:52,0 --> 02:40:52,0
receive this

97
02:40:52,0 --> 02:40:52,0
same

98
02:40:52,0 --> 02:40:52,0
testimony among

99
02:40:52,0 --> 02:40:52,0
this

100
02:40:52,0 --> 02:40:52,0
generation, in this

101
02:40:52,0 --> 02:40:52,0
the beginning

102
02:40:52,0 --> 02:40:52,0
of the

103
02:40:52,0 --> 02:40:52,0
rising up and

104
02:40:52,0 --> 02:40:52,0
the coming

105
02:40:52,0 --> 02:40:52,0
forth of my

106
02:40:52,0 --> 02:40:52,0
church out of

107
02:40:52,0 --> 02:40:52,0
the

108
02:40:52,0 --> 02:40:52,0
wilderness—clear as

109
02:40:52,0 --> 02:40:52,0
the moon, and

110
02:40:52,0 --> 02:40:52,0
fair as the

111
02:40:52,0 --> 02:40:52,0
sun, and

112
02:40:52,0 --> 02:47:46,
terrible as an army with banners.

113
02:47:46,0 --> 02:47:46,0
15 And the

114
02:47:46,0 --> 02:47:46,0
testimony

115
02:47:46,0 --> 02:47:46,0
of three

116
02:47:46,0 --> 02:47:46,0
witnesses will

117
02:47:46,0 --> 02:47:46,0
I send

118
02:47:46,0 --> 02:51:59,
forth of my word.

119
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
16 And

120
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
behold,

121
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
whosoever

122
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
believeth on my

123
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
words, them

124
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
will I visit

125
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
with the

126
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
manifestation

127
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
of my

128
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
Spirit; and

129
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
they shall be

130
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
born of me,

131
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
even of

132
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
water and of

133
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:45,
the Spirit—

134
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
17 And

135
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
you must

136
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
wait yet a

137
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
little

138
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
while, for

139
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
ye are

140
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:59,
not yet ordained—

141
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
18 And

142
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
their

143
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
testimony

144
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
shall

145
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
also go

146
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
forth unto

147
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
the

148
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
condemnation

149
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
of this

150
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0


151
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
generation if

152
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
they

153
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
harden their

154
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:45,
hearts against them;

155
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
19 For

156
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
a

157
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
desolating

158
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
scourge

159
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
shall

160
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
go forth

161
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
among

162
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
the

163
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0


164
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
inhabitants of

165
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
the

166
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
earth, and

167
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
shall

168
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
continue

169
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
to be

170
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
poured

171
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
out from

172
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
time

173
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
to time,

174
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
if

175
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
they

176
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
repent not,

177
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
until

178
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
the

179
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
earth is

180
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
empty,

181
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
and the

182
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0


183
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
inhabitants

184
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
thereof

185
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
are

186
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
consumed

187
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
away and

188
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
utterly

189
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:59,
destroyed by the brightness of my coming.

190
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
20

191
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
Behold, I

192
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
tell

193
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
you

194
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
these

195
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
things,

196
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
even

197
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
as I

198
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
also

199
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
told the

200
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
people

201
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
of

202
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
the

203
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0


204
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
destruction of

205
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0


206
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
Jerusalem;

207
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
and my

208
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
word

209
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
shall be

210
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0


211
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
verified at

212
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
this

213
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
time

214
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:59,0
as it

215
02:51:59,0 --> 02:51:45,
hath hitherto been verified.

216
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
21

217
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
And now

218
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
I

219
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
command

220
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
you,

221
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
my

222
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0


223
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
servant

224
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
Joseph,

225
02:51:45,0 --> 02:51:45,0
to

226
