1
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:19,653
Section 5 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:28,028
 the Prophet, at Harmony, Pennsylvania, March 1829,

3
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:36,403
 at the request of Martin Harris. 
1–10, This

4
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:44,778
 generation will receive the Lord’s word through Joseph

5
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:53,153
 Smith; 
11–18, Three witnesses will testify of the

6
00:00:53,153 --> 00:01:01,528
 Book of Mormon; 
19–20, The word of the Lord will

7
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:09,903
 be verified as in previous times; 
21–35, Martin

8
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:18,278
 Harris may repent and be one of the witnesses.

9
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:23,412
1 Behold, I say unto you, that as my servant

10
00:01:23,412 --> 00:01:28,412
 Martin Harris has desired a witness at my hand, that

11
00:01:28,412 --> 00:01:33,412
 you, my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., have got the

12
00:01:33,412 --> 00:01:38,412
 plates of which you have testified and borne record

13
00:01:38,412 --> 00:01:43,412
 that you have received of me

14
00:01:43,17 --> 00:01:49,77
2 And now, behold, this shall you say unto him—he

15
00:01:49,77 --> 00:01:56,37
 who spake unto you, said unto you: I, the Lord, am

16
00:01:56,37 --> 00:02:02,97
 God, and have given these things unto you, my

17
00:02:02,97 --> 00:02:09,57
 servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and have commanded you

18
00:02:09,57 --> 00:02:16,17
 that you should stand as a witness of these things

19
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:21,769
3 And I have caused you that you should enter into

20
00:02:21,769 --> 00:02:27,369
 a covenant with me, that you should not show them

21
00:02:27,369 --> 00:02:32,969
 except to those persons to whom I commanded you;

22
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:38,569
 and you have no power over them except I grant it

23
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:44,169
 unto you

24
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:49,832
4 And you have a gift to translate the plates; and

25
00:02:49,832 --> 00:02:54,999
 this is the first gift that I bestowed upon you;

26
00:02:54,999 --> 00:03:00,166
 and I have commanded that you should pretend to no

27
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:05,333
 other gift until my purpose is fulfilled in this;

28
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:10,5
 for I will grant unto you no other gift until it

29
00:03:10,5 --> 00:03:15,667
 is finished

30
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:20,128
5 Verily, I say unto you, that woe shall come unto

31
00:03:20,128 --> 00:03:25,128
 the inhabitants of the earth if they will not

32
00:03:25,128 --> 00:03:30,128
 hearken unto my words

33
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:36,877
6 For hereafter you shall be ordained and go forth

34
00:03:36,877 --> 00:03:43,377
 and deliver my words unto the children of men

35
00:03:43,39 --> 00:03:48,64
7 Behold, if they will not believe my words, they

36
00:03:48,64 --> 00:03:53,89
 would not believe you, my servant Joseph, if it

37
00:03:53,89 --> 00:03:59,14
 were possible that you should show them all these

38
00:03:59,14 --> 00:04:04,39
 things which I have committed unto you

39
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:13,144
8 Oh, this unbelieving and stiffnecked

40
00:04:13,144 --> 00:04:21,644
 generation—mine anger is kindled against them

41
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:28,445
9 Behold, verily I say unto you, I have reserved

42
00:04:28,445 --> 00:04:35,195
 those things which I have entrusted unto you, my

43
00:04:35,195 --> 00:04:41,945
 servant Joseph, for a wise purpose in me, and it

44
00:04:41,945 --> 00:04:48,695
 shall be made known unto future generations

45
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:53,188
10 But this generation shall have my word through

46
00:04:53,188 --> 00:04:58,188
 you

47
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:02,298
11 And in addition to your testimony, the

48
00:05:02,298 --> 00:05:06,098
 testimony of three of my servants, whom I shall call and

49
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:09,898
 ordain, unto whom I will show these things, and

50
00:05:09,898 --> 00:05:13,698
 they shall go forth with my words that are given

51
00:05:13,698 --> 00:05:17,498
 through you

52
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:24,751
12 Yea, they shall know of a surety that these

53
00:05:24,751 --> 00:05:31,751
 things are true, for from heaven will I declare it

54
00:05:31,751 --> 00:05:38,751
 unto them

55
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:44,505
13 I will give them power that they may behold and

56
00:05:44,505 --> 00:05:50,505
 view these things as they are

57
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:56,849
14 And to none else will I grant this power, to

58
00:05:56,849 --> 00:06:03,682
 receive this same testimony among this generation,

59
00:06:03,682 --> 00:06:10,515
 in this the beginning of the rising up and the

60
00:06:10,515 --> 00:06:17,348
 coming forth of my church out of the wilderness—clear

61
00:06:17,348 --> 00:06:24,181
 as the moon, and fair as the sun, and terrible as

62
00:06:24,181 --> 00:06:31,014
 an army with banners

63
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:37,458
15 And the testimony of three witnesses will I

64
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:42,958
 send forth of my word

65
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:47,502
16 And behold, whosoever believeth on my words,

66
00:06:47,502 --> 00:06:53,002
 them will I visit with the manifestation of my

67
00:06:53,002 --> 00:06:58,502
 Spirit; and they shall be born of me, even of water and

68
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:04,002
 of the Spirit

69
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:09,257
17 And you must wait yet a little while, for ye

70
00:07:09,257 --> 00:07:14,257
 are not yet ordained

71
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:19,9
18 And their testimony shall also go forth unto

72
00:07:19,9 --> 00:07:25,233
 the condemnation of this generation if they harden

73
00:07:25,233 --> 00:07:30,566
 their hearts against them

74
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:35,95
19 For a desolating scourge shall go forth among

75
00:07:35,95 --> 00:07:41,617
 the inhabitants of the earth, and shall continue to

76
00:07:41,617 --> 00:07:47,284
 be poured out from time to time, if they repent

77
00:07:47,284 --> 00:07:52,951
 not, until the earth is empty, and the inhabitants

78
00:07:52,951 --> 00:07:58,618
 thereof are consumed away and utterly destroyed by

79
00:07:58,618 --> 00:08:04,285
 the brightness of my coming

80
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:10,517
20 Behold, I tell you these things, even as I also

81
00:08:10,517 --> 00:08:16,517
 told the people of the destruction of Jerusalem;

82
00:08:16,517 --> 00:08:22,517
 and my word shall be verified at this time as it

83
00:08:22,517 --> 00:08:28,517
 hath hitherto been verified

84
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:34,541
21 And now I command you, my servant Joseph, to

85
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:40,541
 repent and walk more uprightly before me, and to

86
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:46,541
 yield to the persuasions of men no more

87
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:48,593
22 And that you be firm in keeping the

88
00:08:48,593 --> 00:08:50,593
 commandments wherewith I have commanded you; and if you do

89
00:08:50,593 --> 00:08:52,593
 this, behold I grant unto you eternal life, even if

90
00:08:52,593 --> 00:08:54,593
 you should be slain

91
00:08:54,567 --> 00:09:01,234
23 And now, again, I speak unto you, my servant

92
00:09:01,234 --> 00:09:07,901
 Joseph, concerning the man that desires the witness

93
00:09:07,901 --> 00:09:14,568


94
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:19,287
24 Behold, I say unto him, he exalts himself and

95
00:09:19,287 --> 00:09:24,287
 does not humble himself sufficiently before me; but

96
00:09:24,287 --> 00:09:29,287
 if he will bow down before me, and humble himself

97
00:09:29,287 --> 00:09:34,287
 in mighty prayer and faith, in the sincerity of

98
00:09:34,287 --> 00:09:39,287
 his heart, then will I grant unto him a view of the

99
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:44,287
 things which he desires to see

100
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:49,517
25 And then he shall say unto the people of this

101
00:09:49,517 --> 00:09:54,517
 generation: Behold, I have seen the things which

102
00:09:54,517 --> 00:09:59,517
 the Lord hath shown unto Joseph Smith, Jun., and I

103
00:09:59,517 --> 00:10:04,517
 know of a surety that they are true, for I have

104
00:10:04,517 --> 00:10:09,517
 seen them, for they have been shown unto me by the

105
00:10:09,517 --> 00:10:14,517
 power of God and not of man

106
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:18,614
26 And I the Lord command him, my servant Martin

107
00:10:18,614 --> 00:10:22,781
 Harris, that he shall say no more unto them

108
00:10:22,781 --> 00:10:26,948
 concerning these things, except he shall say: I have seen

109
00:10:26,948 --> 00:10:31,115
 them, and they have been shown unto me by the

110
00:10:31,115 --> 00:10:35,282
 power of God; and these are the words which he shall

111
00:10:35,282 --> 00:10:39,449
 say

112
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:43,538
27 But if he deny this he will break the covenant

113
00:10:43,538 --> 00:10:47,871
 which he has before covenanted with me, and

114
00:10:47,871 --> 00:10:52,204
 behold, he is condemned

115
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:57,838
28 And now, except he humble himself and

116
00:10:57,838 --> 00:11:03,124
 acknowledge unto me the things that he has done which are

117
00:11:03,124 --> 00:11:08,41
 wrong, and covenant with me that he will keep my

118
00:11:08,41 --> 00:11:13,696
 commandments, and exercise faith in me, behold, I

119
00:11:13,696 --> 00:11:18,982
 say unto him, he shall have no such views, for I

120
00:11:18,982 --> 00:11:24,268
 will grant unto him no views of the things of which I

121
00:11:24,268 --> 00:11:29,554
 have spoken

122
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:33,989
29 And if this be the case, I command you, my

123
00:11:33,989 --> 00:11:37,989
 servant Joseph, that you shall say unto him, that he

124
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:41,989
 shall do no more, nor trouble me any more

125
00:11:41,989 --> 00:11:45,989
 concerning this matter

126
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:50,721
30 And if this be the case, behold, I say unto

127
00:11:50,721 --> 00:11:55,971
 thee Joseph, when thou hast translated a few more

128
00:11:55,971 --> 00:12:01,221
 pages thou shalt stop for a season, even until I

129
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:06,471
 command thee again; then thou mayest translate again

130
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:11,358
31 And except thou do this, behold, thou shalt

131
00:12:11,358 --> 00:12:16,691
 have no more gift, and I will take away the things

132
00:12:16,691 --> 00:12:22,024
 which I have entrusted with thee

133
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:28,409
32 And now, because I foresee the lying in wait to

134
00:12:28,409 --> 00:12:34,209
 destroy thee, yea, I foresee that if my servant

135
00:12:34,209 --> 00:12:40,009
 Martin Harris humbleth not himself and receive a

136
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:45,809
 witness from my hand, that he will fall into

137
00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:51,609
 transgression

138
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:55,571
33 And there are many that lie in wait to destroy

139
00:12:55,571 --> 00:12:59,571
 thee from off the face of the earth; and for this

140
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:03,571
 cause, that thy days may be prolonged, I have

141
00:13:03,571 --> 00:13:07,571
 given unto thee these commandments

142
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:11,654
34 Yea, for this cause I have said: Stop, and

143
00:13:11,654 --> 00:13:15,654
 stand still until I command thee, and I will provide

144
00:13:15,654 --> 00:13:19,654
 means whereby thou mayest accomplish the thing

145
00:13:19,654 --> 00:13:23,654
 which I have commanded thee

146
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:26,469
35 And if thou art faithful in keeping my

147
00:13:26,469 --> 00:13:29,802
 commandments, thou shalt be lifted up at the last day.

148
00:13:29,802 --> 00:13:33,135
 Amen.
