00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:20,849
Section 5 Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at 

2
00:00:20,849 --> 00:00:30,42
Harmony, Pennsylvania, March 1829, at the request of Martin Harris. 

3
00:00:30,42 --> 00:00:39,991

1–10, This generation will receive the Lord’s word through Joseph 

4
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:49,562
Smith; 
11–18, Three witnesses will testify of the Book of 

5
00:00:49,562 --> 00:00:59,133
Mormon; 
19–20, The word of the Lord will be verified 

6
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:08,704
as in previous times; 
21–35, Martin Harris may repent and 

7
00:01:08,704 --> 00:01:18,412
be one of the witnesses.  

8
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:23,412
1 Behold, I say unto you, that as my servant 

9
00:01:23,412 --> 00:01:28,412
Martin Harris has desired a witness at my hand, that 

10
00:01:28,412 --> 00:01:33,412
you, my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., have got the plates 

11
00:01:33,412 --> 00:01:38,412
of which you have testified and borne record that you 

12
00:01:38,412 --> 00:01:43,17
have received of me; 

13
00:01:43,17 --> 00:01:49,77
2 And now, behold, this shall you say unto him—he 

14
00:01:49,77 --> 00:01:56,37
who spake unto you, said unto you: I, the Lord, 

15
00:01:56,37 --> 00:02:02,97
am God, and have given these things unto you, my 

16
00:02:02,97 --> 00:02:09,57
servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and have commanded you that you 

17
00:02:09,57 --> 00:02:16,169
should stand as a witness of these things; 

18
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:21,769
3 And I have caused you that you should enter 

19
00:02:21,769 --> 00:02:27,369
into a covenant with me, that you should not show 

20
00:02:27,369 --> 00:02:32,969
them except to those persons to whom I commanded you; 

21
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:38,569
and you have no power over them except I grant 

22
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:44,665
it unto you. 

23
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:49,832
4 And you have a gift to translate the plates; 

24
00:02:49,832 --> 00:02:54,999
and this is the first gift that I bestowed upon 

25
00:02:54,999 --> 00:03:00,166
you; and I have commanded that you should pretend to 

26
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:05,333
no other gift until my purpose is fulfilled in this; 

27
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:10,5
for I will grant unto you no other gift until 

28
00:03:10,5 --> 00:03:15,128
it is finished. 

29
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:20,128
5 Verily, I say unto you, that woe shall come 

30
00:03:20,128 --> 00:03:25,128
unto the inhabitants of the earth if they will not 

31
00:03:25,128 --> 00:03:30,377
hearken unto my words; 

32
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:36,877
6 For hereafter you shall be ordained and go forth 

33
00:03:36,877 --> 00:03:43,39
and deliver my words unto the children of men. 

34
00:03:43,39 --> 00:03:48,64
7 Behold, if they will not believe my words, they 

35
00:03:48,64 --> 00:03:53,89
would not believe you, my servant Joseph, if it were 

36
00:03:53,89 --> 00:03:59,14
possible that you should show them all these things which 

37
00:03:59,14 --> 00:04:04,644
I have committed unto you. 

38
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:13,144
8 Oh, this unbelieving and stiffnecked generation—mine anger is kindled 

39
00:04:13,144 --> 00:04:21,695
against them. 

40
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:28,445
9 Behold, verily I say unto you, I have reserved 

41
00:04:28,445 --> 00:04:35,195
those things which I have entrusted unto you, my servant 

42
00:04:35,195 --> 00:04:41,945
Joseph, for a wise purpose in me, and it shall 

43
00:04:41,945 --> 00:04:48,188
be made known unto future generations; 

44
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:58,498
10 But this generation shall have my word through you; 

45
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:03,248
11 And in addition to your testimony, the testimony of 

46
00:05:03,248 --> 00:05:07,998
three of my servants, whom I shall call and ordain, 

47
00:05:07,998 --> 00:05:12,748
unto whom I will show these things, and they shall 

48
00:05:12,748 --> 00:05:17,751
go forth with my words that are given through you. 

49
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:24,751
12 Yea, they shall know of a surety that these 

50
00:05:24,751 --> 00:05:31,751
things are true, for from heaven will I declare it 

51
00:05:31,751 --> 00:05:38,505
unto them. 

52
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:44,505
13 I will give them power that they may behold 

53
00:05:44,505 --> 00:05:50,016
and view these things as they are; 

54
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:56,849
14 And to none else will I grant this power, 

55
00:05:56,849 --> 00:06:03,682
to receive this same testimony among this generation, in this 

56
00:06:03,682 --> 00:06:10,515
the beginning of the rising up and the coming forth 

57
00:06:10,515 --> 00:06:17,348
of my church out of the wilderness—clear as the moon, 

58
00:06:17,348 --> 00:06:24,181
and fair as the sun, and terrible as an army 

59
00:06:24,181 --> 00:06:31,958
with banners. 

60
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:37,458
15 And the testimony of three witnesses will I send 

61
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:42,002
forth of my word. 

62
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:47,502
16 And behold, whosoever believeth on my words, them will 

63
00:06:47,502 --> 00:06:53,002
I visit with the manifestation of my Spirit; and they 

64
00:06:53,002 --> 00:06:58,502
shall be born of me, even of water and of 

65
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:04,257
the Spirit— 

66
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:09,257
17 And you must wait yet a little while, for 

67
00:07:09,257 --> 00:07:14,567
ye are not yet ordained— 

68
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:19,9
18 And their testimony shall also go forth unto the 

69
00:07:19,9 --> 00:07:25,233
condemnation of this generation if they harden their hearts against 

70
00:07:25,233 --> 00:07:30,283
them; 

71
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:37,083
19 For a desolating scourge shall go forth among the 

72
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:43,883
inhabitants of the earth, and shall continue to be poured 

73
00:07:43,883 --> 00:07:50,683
out from time to time, if they repent not, until 

74
00:07:50,683 --> 00:07:57,483
the earth is empty, and the inhabitants thereof are consumed 

75
00:07:57,483 --> 00:08:04,517
away and utterly destroyed by the brightness of my coming. 

76
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:10,517
20 Behold, I tell you these things, even as I 

77
00:08:10,517 --> 00:08:16,517
also told the people of the destruction of Jerusalem; and 

78
00:08:16,517 --> 00:08:22,517
my word shall be verified at this time as it 

79
00:08:22,517 --> 00:08:28,541
hath hitherto been verified. 

80
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:34,541
21 And now I command you, my servant Joseph, to 

81
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:40,541
repent and walk more uprightly before me, and to yield 

82
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:46,593
to the persuasions of men no more; 

83
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:48,593
22 And that you be firm in keeping the commandments 

84
00:08:48,593 --> 00:08:50,593
wherewith I have commanded you; and if you do this, 

85
00:08:50,593 --> 00:08:52,593
behold I grant unto you eternal life, even if you 

86
00:08:52,593 --> 00:08:54,567
should be slain. 

87
00:08:54,567 --> 00:09:04,567
23 And now, again, I speak unto you, my servant 

88
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:14,287
Joseph, concerning the man that desires the witness— 

89
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:19,287
24 Behold, I say unto him, he exalts himself and 

90
00:09:19,287 --> 00:09:24,287
does not humble himself sufficiently before me; but if he 

91
00:09:24,287 --> 00:09:29,287
will bow down before me, and humble himself in mighty 

92
00:09:29,287 --> 00:09:34,287
prayer and faith, in the sincerity of his heart, then 

93
00:09:34,287 --> 00:09:39,287
will I grant unto him a view of the things 

94
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:44,517
which he desires to see. 

95
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:49,517
25 And then he shall say unto the people of 

96
00:09:49,517 --> 00:09:54,517
this generation: Behold, I have seen the things which the 

97
00:09:54,517 --> 00:09:59,517
Lord hath shown unto Joseph Smith, Jun., and I know 

98
00:09:59,517 --> 00:10:04,517
of a surety that they are true, for I have 

99
00:10:04,517 --> 00:10:09,517
seen them, for they have been shown unto me by 

100
00:10:09,517 --> 00:10:14,447
the power of God and not of man. 

101
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:18,614
26 And I the Lord command him, my servant Martin 

102
00:10:18,614 --> 00:10:22,781
Harris, that he shall say no more unto them concerning 

103
00:10:22,781 --> 00:10:26,948
these things, except he shall say: I have seen them, 

104
00:10:26,948 --> 00:10:31,115
and they have been shown unto me by the power 

105
00:10:31,115 --> 00:10:35,282
of God; and these are the words which he shall 

106
00:10:35,282 --> 00:10:39,205
say. 

107
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:43,538
27 But if he deny this he will break the 

108
00:10:43,538 --> 00:10:47,871
covenant which he has before covenanted with me, and behold, 

109
00:10:47,871 --> 00:10:52,552
he is condemned. 

110
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:57,838
28 And now, except he humble himself and acknowledge unto 

111
00:10:57,838 --> 00:11:03,124
me the things that he has done which are wrong, 

112
00:11:03,124 --> 00:11:08,41
and covenant with me that he will keep my commandments, 

113
00:11:08,41 --> 00:11:13,696
and exercise faith in me, behold, I say unto him, 

114
00:11:13,696 --> 00:11:18,982
he shall have no such views, for I will grant 

115
00:11:18,982 --> 00:11:24,268
unto him no views of the things of which I 

116
00:11:24,268 --> 00:11:29,989
have spoken. 

117
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:33,989
29 And if this be the case, I command you, 

118
00:11:33,989 --> 00:11:37,989
my servant Joseph, that you shall say unto him, that 

119
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:41,989
he shall do no more, nor trouble me any more 

120
00:11:41,989 --> 00:11:45,471
concerning this matter. 

121
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:50,721
30 And if this be the case, behold, I say 

122
00:11:50,721 --> 00:11:55,971
unto thee Joseph, when thou hast translated a few more 

123
00:11:55,971 --> 00:12:01,221
pages thou shalt stop for a season, even until I 

124
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:06,025
command thee again; then thou mayest translate again. 

125
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:11,358
31 And except thou do this, behold, thou shalt have 

126
00:12:11,358 --> 00:12:16,691
no more gift, and I will take away the things 

127
00:12:16,691 --> 00:12:22,609
which I have entrusted with thee. 

128
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:29,859
32 And now, because I foresee the lying in wait 

129
00:12:29,859 --> 00:12:37,109
to destroy thee, yea, I foresee that if my servant 

130
00:12:37,109 --> 00:12:44,359
Martin Harris humbleth not himself and receive a witness from 

131
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:51,571
my hand, that he will fall into transgression; 

132
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:55,571
33 And there are many that lie in wait to 

133
00:12:55,571 --> 00:12:59,571
destroy thee from off the face of the earth; and 

134
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:03,571
for this cause, that thy days may be prolonged, I 

135
00:13:03,571 --> 00:13:07,654
have given unto thee these commandments. 

136
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:11,654
34 Yea, for this cause I have said: Stop, and 

137
00:13:11,654 --> 00:13:15,654
stand still until I command thee, and I will provide 

138
00:13:15,654 --> 00:13:19,654
means whereby thou mayest accomplish the thing which I have 

139
00:13:19,654 --> 00:13:23,136
commanded thee. 

140
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:26,469
35 And if thou art faithful in keeping my commandments, 

141
00:13:26,469 --> 00:13:29,802
thou shalt be lifted up at the last day. Amen. 

142
00:13:29,802 --> 00:13:33,913
