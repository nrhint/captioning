 1, 1831, during a special conference of elders of

4
00:00:30,57 --> 00:00:36,923
 the Church, held at Hiram, Ohio. Many revelations

5
00:00:36,923 --> 00:00:43,276
 had been received from the Lord prior to this time,

6
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:49,629
 and the compilation of these for publication in

7
00:00:49,629 --> 00:00:55,982
 book form was one of the principal subjects passed

8
00:00:55,982 --> 00:01:02,335
 upon at the conference. This section constitutes

00:01:02,335 --> 00:01:08,689

 The voice of warning is to all people;

12
00:01:21,394 --> 00:01:27,747
 Apostasy and wickedness precede the Second Coming;

 Lord’s truths and powers;

15
00:01:40,453 --> 00:01:46,806
 Mormon is brought forth and the true Church is

16
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:53,159
 established; 
34–36, Peace will be taken from the earth;

17
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:59,512
37–39, Search these commandments.

18
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:05,786
1 Hearken, O ye people of my church, saith the

19
00:02:05,786 --> 00:02:12,186
 voice of him who dwells on high, and whose eyes are

20
00:02:12,186 --> 00:02:18,586
 upon all men; yea, verily I say: Hearken ye people

21
00:02:18,586 --> 00:02:24,986
 from afar; and ye that are upon the islands of the

22
00:02:24,986 --> 00:02:31,386
 sea, listen together

23
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:38,368
2 For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all

24
00:02:38,368 --> 00:02:45,618
 men, and there is none to escape; and there is no eye

25
00:02:45,618 --> 00:02:52,868
 that shall not see, neither ear that shall not

26
00:02:52,868 --> 00:03:00,118
 hear, neither heart that shall not be penetrated

27
00:03:00,864 --> 00:03:06,614
3 And the rebellious shall be pierced with much

28
00:03:06,614 --> 00:03:12,364
 sorrow; for their iniquities shall be spoken upon

29
00:03:12,364 --> 00:03:18,114
 the housetops, and their secret acts shall be

30
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:23,864
 revealed

31
00:03:23,62 --> 00:03:29,62
4 And the voice of warning shall be unto all

32
00:03:29,62 --> 00:03:35,62
 people, by the mouths of my disciples, whom I have

33
00:03:35,62 --> 00:03:41,62
 chosen in these last days

34
00:03:41,938 --> 00:03:50,438
5 And they shall go forth and none shall stay

35
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:58,938
 them, for I the Lord have commanded them

36
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:07,055
6 Behold, this is mine authority, and the

37
00:04:07,055 --> 00:04:15,805
 authority of my servants, and my preface unto the book of

38
00:04:15,805 --> 00:04:24,555
 my commandments, which I have given them to

39
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:33,305
 publish unto you, O inhabitants of the earth

40
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:39,306
7 Wherefore, fear and tremble, O ye people, for

41
00:04:39,306 --> 00:04:45,306
 what I the Lord have decreed in them shall be

42
00:04:45,306 --> 00:04:51,306
 fulfilled

43
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:56,741
8 And verily I say unto you, that they who go

44
00:04:56,741 --> 00:05:02,141
 forth, bearing these tidings unto the inhabitants of

45
00:05:02,141 --> 00:05:07,541
 the earth, to them is power given to seal both on

46
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:12,941
 earth and in heaven, the unbelieving and

47
00:05:12,941 --> 00:05:18,341
 rebellious

48
00:05:18,869 --> 00:05:23,869
9 Yea, verily, to seal them up unto the day when

49
00:05:23,869 --> 00:05:28,869
 the wrath of God shall be poured out upon the

50
00:05:28,869 --> 00:05:33,869
 wicked without measure

51
00:05:33,4 --> 00:05:41,9
10 Unto the day when the Lord shall come to

52
00:05:41,9 --> 00:05:50,4
 recompense unto every man according to his work, and

53
00:05:50,4 --> 00:05:58,9
 measure to every man according to the measure which

54
00:05:58,9 --> 00:06:07,4
 he has measured to his fellow man

55
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:15,167
11 Wherefore the voice of the Lord is unto the

56
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:22,667
 ends of the earth, that all that will hear may hear

57
00:06:22,933 --> 00:06:28,433
12 Prepare ye, prepare ye for that which is to

58
00:06:28,433 --> 00:06:33,933
 come, for the Lord is nigh

59
00:06:33,944 --> 00:06:39,277
13 And the anger of the Lord is kindled, and his

60
00:06:39,277 --> 00:06:44,61
 sword is bathed in heaven, and it shall fall upon

61
00:06:44,61 --> 00:06:49,943
 the inhabitants of the earth

62
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:55,609
14 And the arm of the Lord shall be revealed; and

63
00:06:55,609 --> 00:07:01,776
 the day cometh that they who will not hear the

64
00:07:01,776 --> 00:07:07,943
 voice of the Lord, neither the voice of his servants,

65
00:07:07,943 --> 00:07:14,11
 neither give heed to the words of the prophets

66
00:07:14,11 --> 00:07:20,277
 and apostles, shall be cut off from among the

67
00:07:20,277 --> 00:07:26,444
 people

68
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:32,213
15 For they have strayed from mine ordinances, and

69
00:07:32,213 --> 00:07:37,713
 have broken mine everlasting covenant

70
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:43,828
16 They seek not the Lord to establish his

71
00:07:43,828 --> 00:07:50,399
 righteousness, but every man walketh in his own way, and

72
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:56,97
 after the image of his own god, whose image is in

73
00:07:56,97 --> 00:08:03,541
 the likeness of the world, and whose substance is

74
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:10,112
 that of an idol, which waxeth old and shall perish

75
00:08:10,112 --> 00:08:16,683
 in Babylon, even Babylon the great, which shall

76
00:08:16,683 --> 00:08:23,254
 fall

77
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:28,103
17 Wherefore, I the Lord, knowing the calamity

78
00:08:28,103 --> 00:08:32,703
 which should come upon the inhabitants of the earth,

79
00:08:32,703 --> 00:08:37,303
 called upon my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and

80
00:08:37,303 --> 00:08:41,903
 spake unto him from heaven, and gave him

81
00:08:41,903 --> 00:08:46,503
 commandments

82
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:52,759
18 And also gave commandments to others, that they

83
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:59,259
 should proclaim these things unto the world; and

84
00:08:59,259 --> 00:09:05,759
 all this that it might be fulfilled, which was

85
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:12,259
 written by the prophets

86
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:20,802
19 The weak things of the world shall come forth

87
00:09:20,802 --> 00:09:29,052
 and break down the mighty and strong ones, that man

88
00:09:29,052 --> 00:09:37,302
 should not counsel his fellow man, neither trust

89
00:09:37,302 --> 00:09:45,552
 in the arm of flesh

90
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:52,651
20 But that every man might speak in the name of

91
00:09:52,651 --> 00:10:00,151
 God the Lord, even the Savior of the world

92
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:07,667
21 That faith also might increase in the earth

93
00:10:07,44 --> 00:10:10,44
22 That mine everlasting covenant might be

94
00:10:10,44 --> 00:10:13,44
 established

95
00:10:13,496 --> 00:10:20,496
23 That the fulness of my gospel might be

96
00:10:20,496 --> 00:10:27,496
 proclaimed by the weak and the simple unto the ends of the

97
00:10:27,496 --> 00:10:34,496
 world, and before kings and rulers

98
00:10:34,517 --> 00:10:40,267
24 Behold, I am God and have spoken it; these

99
00:10:40,267 --> 00:10:46,017
 commandments are of me, and were given unto my

100
00:10:46,017 --> 00:10:51,767
 servants in their weakness, after the manner of their

101
00:10:51,767 --> 00:10:57,517
 language, that they might come to understanding

102
00:10:57,507 --> 00:11:00,007
25 And inasmuch as they erred it might be made

103
00:11:00,007 --> 00:11:02,507
 known

104
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:05,928
26 And inasmuch as they sought wisdom they might

105
00:11:05,928 --> 00:11:09,428
 be instructed

106
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:12,769
27 And inasmuch as they sinned they might be

107
00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:16,269
 chastened, that they might repent

108
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:20,943
28 And inasmuch as they were humble they might be

109
00:11:20,943 --> 00:11:25,61
 made strong, and blessed from on high, and receive

110
00:11:25,61 --> 00:11:30,277
 knowledge from time to time

111
00:11:30,073 --> 00:11:35,073
29 And after having received the record of the

112
00:11:35,073 --> 00:11:40,073
 Nephites, yea, even my servant Joseph Smith, Jun.,

113
00:11:40,073 --> 00:11:45,073
 might have power to translate through the mercy of

114
00:11:45,073 --> 00:11:50,073
 God, by the power of God, the Book of Mormon

115
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:56,362
30 And also those to whom these commandments were

116
00:11:56,362 --> 00:12:02,648
 given, might have power to lay the foundation of

117
00:12:02,648 --> 00:12:08,934
 this church, and to bring it forth out of obscurity

118
00:12:08,934 --> 00:12:15,22
 and out of darkness, the only true and living

119
00:12:15,22 --> 00:12:21,506
 church upon the face of the whole earth, with which

120
00:12:21,506 --> 00:12:27,792
 I, the Lord, am well pleased, speaking unto the

121
00:12:27,792 --> 00:12:34,078
 church collectively and not individually

122
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:38,837
31 For I the Lord cannot look upon sin with the

123
00:12:38,837 --> 00:12:42,837
 least degree of allowance

124
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:47,345
32 Nevertheless, he that repents and does the

125
00:12:47,345 --> 00:12:52,345
 commandments of the Lord shall be forgiven

126
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:58,372
33 And he that repents not, from him shall be

127
00:12:58,372 --> 00:13:03,872
 taken even the light which he has received; for my

128
00:13:03,872 --> 00:13:09,372
 Spirit shall not always strive with man, saith the

129
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:14,872
 Lord of Hosts

130
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:19,71
34 And again, verily I say unto you, O inhabitants

131
00:13:19,71 --> 00:13:25,043
 of the earth: I the Lord am willing to make these

132
00:13:25,043 --> 00:13:30,376
 things known unto all flesh

133
00:13:30,71 --> 00:13:36,11
35 For I am no respecter of persons, and will that

134
00:13:36,11 --> 00:13:41,51
 all men shall know that the day speedily cometh;

135
00:13:41,51 --> 00:13:46,91
 the hour is not yet, but is nigh at hand, when

136
00:13:46,91 --> 00:13:52,31
 peace shall be taken from the earth, and the devil

137
00:13:52,31 --> 00:13:57,71
 shall have power over his own dominion

138
00:13:57,704 --> 00:14:04,704
36 And also the Lord shall have power over his

139
00:14:04,704 --> 00:14:11,704
 saints, and shall reign in their midst, and shall

140
00:14:11,704 --> 00:14:18,704
 come down in judgment upon Idumea, or the world

141
00:14:18,007 --> 00:14:25,007
37 Search these commandments, for they are true

142
00:14:25,007 --> 00:14:32,007
 and faithful, and the prophecies and promises which

143
00:14:32,007 --> 00:14:39,007
 are in them shall all be fulfilled

144
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:45,179
38 What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and

145
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:50,846
 I excuse not myself; and though the heavens and

146
00:14:50,846 --> 00:14:56,513
 the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away,

147
00:14:56,513 --> 00:15:02,18
 but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own

148
00:15:02,18 --> 00:15:07,847
 voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same

149
00:15:07,847 --> 00:15:13,514


150
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:15,679
39 For behold, and lo, the Lord is God, and the

151
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:18,346
 Spirit beareth record, and the record is true, and

152
00:15:18,346 --> 00:15:21,013
 the truth abideth forever and ever. Amen.
