Section 2 An extract from Joseph Smith’s history relating the 

2
00:00:19,078 --> 00:00:26,878
words of the angel Moroni to Joseph Smith the Prophet, 

3
00:00:26,878 --> 00:00:34,678
while in the house of the Prophet’s father at Manchester, 

4
00:00:34,678 --> 00:00:42,478
New York, on the evening of September 21, 1823. Moroni 

5
00:00:42,478 --> 00:00:50,278
was the last of a long line of historians who 

6
00:00:50,278 --> 00:00:58,078
had made the record that is now before the world 

7
00:00:58,078 --> 00:01:05,878
as the Book of Mormon. (Compare 
Malachi 4:5–6; also 
sections 

8
00:01:05,878 --> 00:01:13,678
27:9; 
110:13–16; and 
128:18.) 
1, Elijah is to reveal the 

9
00:01:13,678 --> 00:01:21,478
priesthood; 
2–3, The promises of the fathers are planted in 

10
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:29,278
the hearts of the children.  

11
00:01:29,69 --> 00:01:36,023
1 Behold, I will reveal unto you the Priesthood, by 

12
00:01:36,023 --> 00:01:42,356
the hand of Elijah the prophet, before the coming of 

13
00:01:42,356 --> 00:01:48,69
the great and dreadful day of the Lord. 

14
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:54,375
2 And he shall plant in the hearts of the 

15
00:01:54,375 --> 00:02:00,708
children the promises made to the fathers, and the hearts 

16
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:07,041
of the children shall turn to their fathers. 

17
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:09,044
3 If it were not so, the whole earth would 

18
00:02:09,044 --> 00:02:11,044
be utterly wasted at his coming.
