2
00:00:08,0 --> 00:00:16,0
relating the words of the angel Moroni to

3
00:00:16,0 --> 00:00:24,0
Joseph Smith the Prophet, while in the house of the

4
00:00:24,0 --> 00:00:32,0
Prophet’s father at Manchester, New York, on the

5
00:00:32,0 --> 00:00:40,0
evening of September 21, 1823. Moroni was the

6
00:00:40,0 --> 00:00:48,0
last of a long line of historians who had made the

7
00:00:48,0 --> 00:00:56,0
record that is now before the world as the Book

8
00:00:56,0 --> 00:01:04,0
of Mormon. (Compare 
Malachi 4:5–6; also

1, Elijah

10
00:01:12,0 --> 00:01:20,0
is to reveal the priesthood; 
2–3, The promises

11
00:01:20,0 --> 00:01:28,972
of the fathers are planted in the hearts of the children. 

12
00:01:28,972 --> 00:01:35,305
1 Behold, I will reveal unto you the Priesthood,

13
00:01:35,305 --> 00:01:41,638
by the hand of Elijah the prophet, before the

14
00:01:41,638 --> 00:01:47,524
coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.

15
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:51,191
2 And he shall plant in the hearts of the

16
00:01:51,191 --> 00:01:54,858
children the promises made to the fathers, and the

17
00:01:54,858 --> 00:01:58,535
hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers.

18
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:01,535
3 If it were not so, the whole earth

19
00:02:01,535 --> 00:02:04,624
would be utterly wasted at his coming.
