00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
relating the words of the angel Moroni to

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Joseph Smith the Prophet, while in the house of the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Prophet’s father at Manchester, New York, on the

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
evening of September 21, 1823. Moroni was the

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
last of a long line of historians who had made the

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
record that is now before the world as the Book

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of Mormon. (Compare

1, Elijah

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
is to reveal the priesthood; 
2–3, The promises

11
00:00:00,0 --> 01:28:53,
of the fathers are planted in the hearts of the children. 

12
01:28:53,0 --> 01:28:53,0
1 Behold, I will reveal unto you the Priesthood,

13
01:28:53,0 --> 01:28:53,0
by the hand of Elijah the prophet, before the

14
01:28:53,0 --> 01:47:52,
coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.

15
01:47:52,0 --> 01:47:52,0
2 And he shall plant in the hearts of the

16
01:47:52,0 --> 01:47:52,0
children the promises made to the fathers, and the

17
01:47:52,0 --> 02:02:54,
hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers.

18
02:02:54,0 --> 02:02:54,0
3 If it were not so, the whole earth

19
02:02:54,0 --> 02:06:33,
would be utterly wasted at his coming.
