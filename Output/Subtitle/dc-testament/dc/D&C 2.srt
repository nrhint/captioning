 of September 21, 1823. Moroni was the last of a

6
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:53,824
 long line of historians who had made the record that

7
00:00:53,824 --> 00:01:00,915
 is now before the world as the Book of Mormon.

11
00:01:22,188 --> 00:01:29,279

12
00:01:29,69 --> 00:01:36,023
1 Behold, I will reveal unto you the Priesthood,

13
00:01:36,023 --> 00:01:42,356
 by the hand of Elijah the prophet, before the

14
00:01:42,356 --> 00:01:48,689

2 And he shall plant in the hearts of the children

16
00:01:54,374 --> 00:02:00,707
 the promises made to the fathers, and the hearts

17
00:02:00,707 --> 00:02:07,04
 of the children shall turn to their fathers.

00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:09,044

19
00:02:09,044 --> 00:02:11,044
 utterly wasted at his coming.
