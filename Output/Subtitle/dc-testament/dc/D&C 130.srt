00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Smith the Prophet, at Ramus, Illinois, April 2,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
1843. 
1–3, The Father and the Son may appear

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
personally to men; 
4–7, Angels reside in a celestial

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
sphere; 
8–9, The celestial earth will be a

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
great Urim and Thummim; 
10–11, A white stone is

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
given to all who enter the celestial world; 
12–17,

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
The time of the Second Coming is withheld from the

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Prophet; 
18–19, Intelligence gained in this

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
life rises with us in the Resurrection; 
20–21, All

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
blessings come by obedience to law; 
22–23, The

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Father and the Son have bodies of flesh and bones.

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
John 14:23—The appearing of the Father and the

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Son, in that verse, is a personal appearance; and

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the idea that the Father and the Son dwell in a

16
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
man’s heart is an old sectarian notion, and is

17
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
false.
Revelation 2:17, will become a Urim and

18
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Thummim to each individual who receives one, whereby

19
00:00:00,0 --> 01:45:51,
things pertaining to a higher order of kingdoms will be made known;

20
01:45:51,0 --> 01:45:51,0
1 When the Savior shall appear we

21
01:45:51,0 --> 01:45:51,0
shall see him as he is. We shall

22
01:45:51,0 --> 01:57:29,
see that he is a man like ourselves.

23
01:57:29,0 --> 01:57:29,0
2 And that same sociality which

24
01:57:29,0 --> 01:57:29,0
exists among us here will

25
01:57:29,0 --> 01:57:29,0
exist among us there, only it will

26
01:57:29,0 --> 01:57:29,0
be coupled with eternal glory,

27
01:57:29,0 --> 02:17:06,
which glory we do not now enjoy.
