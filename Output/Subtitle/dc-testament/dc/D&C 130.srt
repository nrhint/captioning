00:00:11,528 --> 00:00:16,528
Section 130 Items of instruction given by Joseph

2
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:21,528
 Smith the Prophet, at Ramus, Illinois, April 2,

3
00:00:21,528 --> 00:00:26,528
 1843. 
1–3, The Father and the Son may appear

4
00:00:26,528 --> 00:00:31,528
 personally to men; 
4–7, Angels reside in a celestial

5
00:00:31,528 --> 00:00:36,528
 sphere; 
8–9, The celestial earth will be a great

6
00:00:36,528 --> 00:00:41,528
 Urim and Thummim; 
10–11, A white stone is given to

7
00:00:41,528 --> 00:00:46,528
 all who enter the celestial world; 
12–17, The time

8
00:00:46,528 --> 00:00:51,528
 of the Second Coming is withheld from the

9
00:00:51,528 --> 00:00:56,528
 Prophet; 
18–19, Intelligence gained in this life rises

10
00:00:56,528 --> 00:01:01,528
 with us in the Resurrection; 
20–21, All blessings

11
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:06,528
 come by obedience to law; 
22–23, The Father and

12
00:01:06,528 --> 00:01:11,528
 the Son have bodies of flesh and bones. 
John

13
00:01:11,528 --> 00:01:16,528
 14:23—The appearing of the Father and the Son, in that

14
00:01:16,528 --> 00:01:21,528
 verse, is a personal appearance; and the idea that

15
00:01:21,528 --> 00:01:26,528
 the Father and the Son dwell in a man’s heart is

16
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:31,528
 an old sectarian notion, and is false.
Revelation

17
00:01:31,528 --> 00:01:36,528
 2:17, will become a Urim and Thummim to each

18
00:01:36,528 --> 00:01:41,528
 individual who receives one, whereby things pertaining

19
00:01:41,528 --> 00:01:46,528
 to a higher order of kingdoms will be made known

20
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:50,673
1 When the Savior shall appear we shall see him as

21
00:01:50,673 --> 00:01:54,673
 he is. We shall see that he is a man like

22
00:01:54,673 --> 00:01:58,673
 ourselves

23
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:02,935
2 And that same sociality which exists among us

24
00:02:02,935 --> 00:02:07,685
 here will exist among us there, only it will be

25
00:02:07,685 --> 00:02:12,435
 coupled with eternal glory, which glory we do not now

26
00:02:12,435 --> 00:02:17,185
 enjoy

27
00:02:17,688 --> 00:02:53,688
3

28
00:02:53,657 --> 00:02:59,657
4 In answer to the question—Is not the reckoning

29
00:02:59,657 --> 00:03:05,657
 of God’s time, angel’s time, prophet’s time, and

30
00:03:05,657 --> 00:03:11,657
 man’s time, according to the planet on which they

31
00:03:11,657 --> 00:03:17,657
 reside

32
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:25,397
5 I answer, Yes. But there are no angels who

33
00:03:25,397 --> 00:03:33,397
 minister to this earth but those who do belong or have

34
00:03:33,397 --> 00:03:41,397
 belonged to it

35
00:03:41,371 --> 00:03:46,871
6 The angels do not reside on a planet like this

36
00:03:46,871 --> 00:03:52,371
 earth

37
00:03:52,382 --> 00:03:58,632
7 But they reside in the presence of God, on a

38
00:03:58,632 --> 00:04:04,882
 globe like a sea of glass and fire, where all things

39
00:04:04,882 --> 00:04:11,132
 for their glory are manifest, past, present, and

40
00:04:11,132 --> 00:04:17,382
 future, and are continually before the Lord

41
00:04:17,39 --> 00:04:21,89
8 The place where God resides is a great Urim and

42
00:04:21,89 --> 00:04:26,39
 Thummim

43
00:04:26,7 --> 00:04:30,7
9 This earth, in its sanctified and immortal

44
00:04:30,7 --> 00:04:34,7
 state, will be made like unto crystal and will be a

45
00:04:34,7 --> 00:04:38,7
 Urim and Thummim to the inhabitants who dwell

46
00:04:38,7 --> 00:04:42,7
 thereon, whereby all things pertaining to an inferior

47
00:04:42,7 --> 00:04:46,7
 kingdom, or all kingdoms of a lower order, will be

48
00:04:46,7 --> 00:04:50,7
 manifest to those who dwell on it; and this earth

49
00:04:50,7 --> 00:04:54,7
 will be Christ’s

50
00:04:54,444 --> 00:05:27,444
10 Then the white stone mentioned in

51
00:05:27,21 --> 00:05:32,96
11 And a white stone is given to each of those who

52
00:05:32,96 --> 00:05:38,71
 come into the celestial kingdom, whereon is a new

53
00:05:38,71 --> 00:05:44,46
 name written, which no man knoweth save he that

54
00:05:44,46 --> 00:05:50,21
 receiveth it. The new name is the key word

55
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:55,467
12 I prophesy, in the name of the Lord God, that

56
00:05:55,467 --> 00:06:00,717
 the commencement of the difficulties which will

57
00:06:00,717 --> 00:06:05,967
 cause much bloodshed previous to the coming of the

58
00:06:05,967 --> 00:06:11,217
 Son of Man will be in South Carolina

59
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:17,388
13 It may probably arise through the slave

60
00:06:17,388 --> 00:06:23,055
 question. This a voice declared to me, while I was

61
00:06:23,055 --> 00:06:28,722
 praying earnestly on the subject, December 25th, 1832

62
00:06:28,738 --> 00:06:33,071
14 I was once praying very earnestly to know the

63
00:06:33,071 --> 00:06:37,404
 time of the coming of the Son of Man, when I heard

64
00:06:37,404 --> 00:06:41,737
 a voice repeat the following

65
00:06:41,751 --> 00:06:46,251
15 Joseph, my son, if thou livest until thou art

66
00:06:46,251 --> 00:06:50,751
 eighty-five years old, thou shalt see the face of

67
00:06:50,751 --> 00:06:55,251
 the Son of Man; therefore let this suffice, and

68
00:06:55,251 --> 00:06:59,751
 trouble me no more on this matter

69
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:05,503
16 I was left thus, without being able to decide

70
00:07:05,503 --> 00:07:11,253
 whether this coming referred to the beginning of

71
00:07:11,253 --> 00:07:17,003
 the millennium or to some previous appearing, or

72
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:22,753
 whether I should die and thus see his face

73
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:29,309
17 I believe the coming of the Son of Man will not

74
00:07:29,309 --> 00:07:36,309
 be any sooner than that time

75
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:41,256
18 Whatever principle of intelligence we attain

76
00:07:41,256 --> 00:07:45,923
 unto in this life, it will rise with us in the

77
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:50,59
 resurrection

78
00:07:50,353 --> 00:07:56,853
19 And if a person gains more knowledge and

79
00:07:56,853 --> 00:08:03,353
 intelligence in this life through his diligence and

80
00:08:03,353 --> 00:08:09,853
 obedience than another, he will have so much the

81
00:08:09,853 --> 00:08:16,353
 advantage in the world to come

82
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:21,462
20 There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven

83
00:08:21,462 --> 00:08:26,795
 before the foundations of this world, upon which

84
00:08:26,795 --> 00:08:32,128
 all blessings are predicated

85
00:08:32,662 --> 00:08:35,662
21 And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is

86
00:08:35,662 --> 00:08:38,662
 by obedience to that law upon which it is

87
00:08:38,662 --> 00:08:41,662
 predicated

88
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:47,088
22 The Father has a body of flesh and bones as

89
00:08:47,088 --> 00:08:52,488
 tangible as man’s; the Son also; but the Holy Ghost

90
00:08:52,488 --> 00:08:57,888
 has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a

91
00:08:57,888 --> 00:09:03,288
 personage of Spirit. Were it not so, the Holy Ghost could

92
00:09:03,288 --> 00:09:08,688
 not dwell in us

93
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:14,448
23 A man may receive the Holy Ghost, and it may

94
00:09:14,448 --> 00:09:19,948
 descend upon him and not tarry with him.
