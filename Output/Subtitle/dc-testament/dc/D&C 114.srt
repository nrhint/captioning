1–2, Church positions held by those

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:38:59,
who are not faithful will be given to others.

1 Verily thus saith the Lord: It is wisdom

6
00:38:59,0 --> 00:38:59,0
in my servant David W. Patten, that he

7
00:38:59,0 --> 00:38:59,0
settle up all his business as soon as he

8
00:38:59,0 --> 00:38:59,0
possibly can, and make a disposition of his

9
00:38:59,0 --> 00:38:59,0
merchandise, that he may perform a mission unto

10
00:38:59,0 --> 00:38:59,0
me next spring, in company with others,

11
00:38:59,0 --> 00:38:59,0
even twelve including himself, to testify of

12
00:38:59,0 --> 00:56:01,
my name and bear glad tidings unto all the world.

13
00:56:01,0 --> 00:56:01,0
2 For verily thus saith the Lord, that

14
00:56:01,0 --> 00:56:01,0
inasmuch as there are those among you who

15
00:56:01,0 --> 00:56:01,0
deny my name, others shall be planted in

16
00:56:01,0 --> 01:19:02,
their stead and receive their bishopric. Amen.
