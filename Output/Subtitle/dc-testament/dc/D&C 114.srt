Section 114 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:18,278 --> 00:00:25,278
 the Prophet, at Far West, Missouri, April 11,

3
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:32,278
 1838. 
1–2, Church positions held by those who are not

4
00:00:32,278 --> 00:00:39,278
 faithful will be given to others.

5
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:45,473
1 Verily thus saith the Lord: It is wisdom in my

6
00:00:45,473 --> 00:00:51,473
 servant David W. Patten, that he settle up all his

7
00:00:51,473 --> 00:00:57,473
 business as soon as he possibly can, and make a

8
00:00:57,473 --> 00:01:03,473
 disposition of his merchandise, that he may perform

9
00:01:03,473 --> 00:01:09,473
 a mission unto me next spring, in company with

10
00:01:09,473 --> 00:01:15,473
 others, even twelve including himself, to testify of

11
00:01:15,473 --> 00:01:21,473
 my name and bear glad tidings unto all the world

12
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:24,964
2 For verily thus saith the Lord, that inasmuch as

13
00:01:24,964 --> 00:01:28,714
 there are those among you who deny my name,

14
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:32,464
 others shall be planted in their stead and receive

15
00:01:32,464 --> 00:01:36,214
 their bishopric. Amen.
