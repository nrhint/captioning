00:00:11,295 --> 00:00:18,064
Section 39 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:18,064 --> 00:00:24,833
 the Prophet to James Covel, at Fayette, New York,

3
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:31,602
 January 5, 1831. James Covel, who had been a

4
00:00:31,602 --> 00:00:38,371
 Methodist minister for about forty years, covenanted

5
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:45,14
 with the Lord that he would obey any command that the

6
00:00:45,14 --> 00:00:51,909
 Lord would give to him through Joseph the

7
00:00:51,909 --> 00:00:58,678
 Prophet. 
1–4, The Saints have power to become the sons

8
00:00:58,678 --> 00:01:05,447
 of God; 
5–6, To receive the gospel is to receive

9
00:01:05,447 --> 00:01:12,216
 Christ; 
7–14, James Covel is commanded to be

10
00:01:12,216 --> 00:01:18,985
 baptized and labor in the Lord’s vineyard; 
15–21, The

11
00:01:18,985 --> 00:01:25,754
 Lord’s servants are to preach the gospel before

12
00:01:25,754 --> 00:01:32,523
 the Second Coming; 
22–24, Those who receive the

13
00:01:32,523 --> 00:01:39,292
 gospel will be gathered in time and in eternity.

14
00:01:39,9 --> 00:01:45,233
1 Hearken and listen to the voice of him who is

15
00:01:45,233 --> 00:01:50,566
 from all eternity to all eternity, the Great I Am,

16
00:01:50,566 --> 00:01:55,899
 even Jesus Christ

17
00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:00,982
2 The light and the life of the world; a light

18
00:02:00,982 --> 00:02:06,315
 which shineth in darkness and the darkness

19
00:02:06,315 --> 00:02:11,648
 comprehendeth it not

20
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:12,132
3 The same which came in the meridian of time unto

21
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:12,632
 mine own, and mine own received me not

22
00:02:12,015 --> 00:02:23,348
4 But to as many as received me, gave I power to

23
00:02:23,348 --> 00:02:34,681
 become my sons; and even so will I give unto as

24
00:02:34,681 --> 00:02:46,014
 many as will receive me, power to become my sons

25
00:02:46,283 --> 00:02:50,95
5 And verily, verily, I say unto you, he that

26
00:02:50,95 --> 00:02:55,617
 receiveth my gospel receiveth me; and he that

27
00:02:55,617 --> 00:03:00,284
 receiveth not my gospel receiveth not me

28
00:03:00,564 --> 00:03:06,164
6 And this is my gospel—repentance and baptism by

29
00:03:06,164 --> 00:03:11,764
 water, and then cometh the baptism of fire and the

30
00:03:11,764 --> 00:03:17,364
 Holy Ghost, even the Comforter, which showeth all

31
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:22,964
 things, and teacheth the peaceable things of the

32
00:03:22,964 --> 00:03:28,564
 kingdom

33
00:03:28,058 --> 00:03:34,558
7 And now, behold, I say unto you, my servant

34
00:03:34,558 --> 00:03:41,058
 James, I have looked upon thy works and I know thee

35
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:47,155
8 And verily I say unto thee, thine heart is now

36
00:03:47,155 --> 00:03:52,488
 right before me at this time; and, behold, I have

37
00:03:52,488 --> 00:03:57,821
 bestowed great blessings upon thy head

38
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:02,904
9 Nevertheless, thou hast seen great sorrow, for

39
00:04:02,904 --> 00:04:08,237
 thou hast rejected me many times because of pride

40
00:04:08,237 --> 00:04:13,57
 and the cares of the world

41
00:04:13,87 --> 00:04:19,87
10 But, behold, the days of thy deliverance are

42
00:04:19,87 --> 00:04:25,87
 come, if thou wilt hearken to my voice, which saith

43
00:04:25,87 --> 00:04:31,87
 unto thee: Arise and be baptized, and wash away

44
00:04:31,87 --> 00:04:37,87
 your sins, calling on my name, and you shall receive

45
00:04:37,87 --> 00:04:43,87
 my Spirit, and a blessing so great as you never

46
00:04:43,87 --> 00:04:49,87
 have known

47
00:04:49,606 --> 00:04:56,406
11 And if thou do this, I have prepared thee for a

48
00:04:56,406 --> 00:05:03,206
 greater work. Thou shalt preach the fulness of my

49
00:05:03,206 --> 00:05:10,006
 gospel, which I have sent forth in these last

50
00:05:10,006 --> 00:05:16,806
 days, the covenant which I have sent forth to recover

51
00:05:16,806 --> 00:05:23,606
 my people, which are of the house of Israel

52
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:29,689
12 And it shall come to pass that power shall rest

53
00:05:29,689 --> 00:05:36,022
 upon thee; thou shalt have great faith, and I

54
00:05:36,022 --> 00:05:42,355
 will be with thee and go before thy face

55
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:49,125
13 Thou art called to labor in my vineyard, and to

56
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:56,125
 build up my church, and to bring forth Zion, that

57
00:05:56,125 --> 00:06:03,125
 it may rejoice upon the hills and flourish

58
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:07,396
14 Behold, verily, verily, I say unto thee, thou

59
00:06:07,396 --> 00:06:11,396
 art not called to go into the eastern countries,

60
00:06:11,396 --> 00:06:15,396
 but thou art called to go to the Ohio

61
00:06:15,692 --> 00:06:21,092
15 And inasmuch as my people shall assemble

62
00:06:21,092 --> 00:06:26,492
 themselves at the Ohio, I have kept in store a blessing

63
00:06:26,492 --> 00:06:31,892
 such as is not known among the children of men,

64
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:37,292
 and it shall be poured forth upon their heads. And

65
00:06:37,292 --> 00:06:42,692
 from thence men shall go forth into all nations

66
00:06:42,686 --> 00:06:49,686
16 Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, that

67
00:06:49,686 --> 00:06:56,686
 the people in Ohio call upon me in much faith,

68
00:06:56,686 --> 00:07:03,686
 thinking I will stay my hand in judgment upon the

69
00:07:03,686 --> 00:07:10,686
 nations, but I cannot deny my word

70
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:17,196
17 Wherefore lay to with your might and call

71
00:07:17,196 --> 00:07:24,196
 faithful laborers into my vineyard, that it may be

72
00:07:24,196 --> 00:07:31,196
 pruned for the last time

73
00:07:31,501 --> 00:07:36,168
18 And inasmuch as they do repent and receive the

74
00:07:36,168 --> 00:07:40,835
 fulness of my gospel, and become sanctified, I

75
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:45,502
 will stay mine hand in judgment

76
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:50,498
19 Wherefore, go forth, crying with a loud voice,

77
00:07:50,498 --> 00:07:55,498
 saying: The kingdom of heaven is at hand; crying:

78
00:07:55,498 --> 00:08:00,498
 Hosanna! blessed be the name of the Most High God

79
00:08:00,498 --> 00:08:05,498


80
00:08:05,802 --> 00:08:15,802
20 Go forth baptizing with water, preparing the

81
00:08:15,802 --> 00:08:25,802
 way before my face for the time of my coming

82
00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:34,289
21 For the time is at hand; the day or the hour no

83
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:42,789
 man knoweth; but it surely shall come

84
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:50,155
22 And he that receiveth these things receiveth

85
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:57,488
 me; and they shall be gathered unto me in time and

86
00:08:57,488 --> 00:09:04,821
 in eternity

87
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:09,177
23 And again, it shall come to pass that on as

88
00:09:09,177 --> 00:09:13,777
 many as ye shall baptize with water, ye shall lay

89
00:09:13,777 --> 00:09:18,377
 your hands, and they shall receive the gift of the

90
00:09:18,377 --> 00:09:22,977
 Holy Ghost, and shall be looking forth for the signs

91
00:09:22,977 --> 00:09:27,577
 of my coming, and shall know me

92
00:09:27,6 --> 00:09:35,6
24 Behold, I come quickly. Even so. Amen.
