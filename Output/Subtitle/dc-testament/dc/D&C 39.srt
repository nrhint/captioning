00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 39 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Prophet to James Covel, at Fayette, New York,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
January 5, 1831. James Covel, who had been a

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Methodist minister for about forty years, covenanted

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
with the Lord that he would obey any command

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
that the Lord would give to him through Joseph the

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Prophet. 
1–4, The Saints have power to become the

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
sons of God; 
5–6, To receive the gospel is to

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
receive Christ; 
7–14, James Covel is commanded to

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
be baptized and labor in the Lord’s vineyard;

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
15–21, The Lord’s servants are to preach the

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
gospel before the Second Coming; 
22–24, Those who

13
00:00:00,0 --> 01:39:27,
receive the gospel will be gathered in time and in eternity. 

14
01:39:27,0 --> 01:39:27,0
1 Hearken and listen to the voice of

15
01:39:27,0 --> 01:39:27,0
him who is from all eternity to all

16
01:39:27,0 --> 01:51:33,
eternity, the Great I Am, even Jesus Christ—

17
01:51:33,0 --> 01:51:33,0
2 The light and the life of the

18
01:51:33,0 --> 01:51:33,0
world; a light which shineth in darkness

19
01:51:33,0 --> 01:53:37,
and the darkness comprehendeth it not;

20
01:53:37,0 --> 01:53:37,0
3 The same which came in the

21
01:53:37,0 --> 01:53:37,0
meridian of time unto mine own,

22
01:53:37,0 --> 01:49:45,
and mine own received me not;

23
01:49:45,0 --> 01:49:45,0
4 But to as many as received

24
01:49:45,0 --> 01:49:45,0
me, gave I power to become my

25
01:49:45,0 --> 01:49:45,0
sons; and even so will I

26
01:49:45,0 --> 01:49:45,0
give unto as many as will

27
01:49:45,0 --> 01:53:52,
receive me, power to become my sons.

28
01:53:52,0 --> 01:53:52,0
5 And verily, verily, I

29
01:53:52,0 --> 01:53:52,0
say unto you, he that

30
01:53:52,0 --> 01:53:52,0
receiveth my gospel receiveth

31
01:53:52,0 --> 01:53:52,0
me; and he that receiveth

32
01:53:52,0 --> 01:57:30,
not my gospel receiveth not me.

33
01:57:30,0 --> 01:57:30,0
6 And this is my

34
01:57:30,0 --> 01:57:30,0
gospel—repentance and baptism by

35
01:57:30,0 --> 01:57:30,0
water, and then cometh the

36
01:57:30,0 --> 01:57:30,0
baptism of fire and the

37
01:57:30,0 --> 01:57:30,0
Holy Ghost, even the

38
01:57:30,0 --> 01:57:30,0
Comforter, which showeth all

39
01:57:30,0 --> 01:57:30,0
things, and teacheth the

40
01:57:30,0 --> 02:04:33,
peaceable things of the kingdom.

41
02:04:33,0 --> 02:04:33,0
7 And now, behold, I say

42
02:04:33,0 --> 02:04:33,0
unto you, my servant

43
02:04:33,0 --> 02:04:33,0
James, I have looked upon

44
02:04:33,0 --> 02:09:10,
thy works and I know thee.

45
02:09:10,0 --> 02:09:10,0
8 And verily I say unto

46
02:09:10,0 --> 02:09:10,0
thee, thine heart is

47
02:09:10,0 --> 02:09:10,0
now right before me at

48
02:09:10,0 --> 02:09:10,0
this time; and, behold,

49
02:09:10,0 --> 02:09:10,0
I have bestowed great

50
02:09:10,0 --> 02:44:45,
blessings upon thy head;

51
02:44:45,0 --> 02:44:45,0
9 Nevertheless, thou

52
02:44:45,0 --> 02:44:45,0
hast seen great

53
02:44:45,0 --> 02:44:45,0
sorrow, for thou hast

54
02:44:45,0 --> 02:44:45,0
rejected me many times

55
02:44:45,0 --> 02:44:45,0
because of pride and

56
02:44:45,0 --> 02:59:47,
the cares of the world.

57
02:59:47,0 --> 02:59:47,0
10 But, behold, the

58
02:59:47,0 --> 02:59:47,0
days of thy

59
02:59:47,0 --> 02:59:47,0
deliverance are come, if

60
02:59:47,0 --> 02:59:47,0
thou wilt hearken to my

61
02:59:47,0 --> 02:59:47,0
voice, which saith

62
02:59:47,0 --> 02:59:47,0
unto thee: Arise and

63
02:59:47,0 --> 02:59:47,0
be baptized, and

64
02:59:47,0 --> 02:59:47,0
wash away your sins,

65
02:59:47,0 --> 02:59:47,0
calling on my name,

66
02:59:47,0 --> 02:59:47,0
and you shall receive

67
02:59:47,0 --> 02:59:47,0
my Spirit, and a

68
02:59:47,0 --> 02:59:47,0
blessing so great as

69
02:59:47,0 --> 03:27:23,
you never have known.

70
03:27:23,0 --> 03:27:23,0
11 And if thou do

71
03:27:23,0 --> 03:27:23,0
this, I have

72
03:27:23,0 --> 03:27:23,0
prepared thee for a

73
03:27:23,0 --> 03:27:23,0
greater work. Thou

74
03:27:23,0 --> 03:27:23,0
shalt preach the

75
03:27:23,0 --> 03:27:23,0
fulness of my gospel,

76
03:27:23,0 --> 03:27:23,0
which I have sent

77
03:27:23,0 --> 03:27:23,0
forth in these

78
03:27:23,0 --> 03:27:23,0
last days, the

79
03:27:23,0 --> 03:27:23,0
covenant which I have

80
03:27:23,0 --> 03:27:23,0
sent forth to

81
03:27:23,0 --> 03:27:23,0
recover my people,

82
03:27:23,0 --> 03:40:27,
which are of the house of Israel.

83
03:40:27,0 --> 03:40:27,0
12 And it shall

84
03:40:27,0 --> 03:40:27,0
come to pass that

85
03:40:27,0 --> 03:40:27,0
power shall rest

86
03:40:27,0 --> 03:40:27,0
upon thee; thou

87
03:40:27,0 --> 03:40:27,0
shalt have great

88
03:40:27,0 --> 03:40:27,0
faith, and I will

89
03:40:27,0 --> 03:40:27,0
be with thee and

90
03:40:27,0 --> 03:54:31,
go before thy face.

91
03:54:31,0 --> 03:54:31,0
13 Thou art

92
03:54:31,0 --> 03:54:31,0
called to labor in

93
03:54:31,0 --> 03:54:31,0
my vineyard, and

94
03:54:31,0 --> 03:54:31,0
to build up my

95
03:54:31,0 --> 03:54:31,0
church, and to

96
03:54:31,0 --> 03:54:31,0
bring forth Zion,

97
03:54:31,0 --> 03:54:31,0
that it may

98
03:54:31,0 --> 03:54:31,0
rejoice upon the

99
03:54:31,0 --> 03:56:35,
hills and flourish.

100
03:56:35,0 --> 03:56:35,0
14 Behold,

101
03:56:35,0 --> 03:56:35,0
verily, verily, I

102
03:56:35,0 --> 03:56:35,0
say unto thee,

103
03:56:35,0 --> 03:56:35,0
thou art not

104
03:56:35,0 --> 03:56:35,0
called to go into

105
03:56:35,0 --> 03:56:35,0
the eastern

106
03:56:35,0 --> 03:56:35,0
countries, but

107
03:56:35,0 --> 03:56:35,0
thou art called to

108
03:56:35,0 --> 04:11:37,
go to the Ohio.

109
04:11:37,0 --> 04:11:37,0
15 And

110
04:11:37,0 --> 04:11:37,0
inasmuch as my people

111
04:11:37,0 --> 04:11:37,0
shall

112
04:11:37,0 --> 04:11:37,0
assemble themselves

113
04:11:37,0 --> 04:11:37,0
at the Ohio, I

114
04:11:37,0 --> 04:11:37,0
have kept in

115
04:11:37,0 --> 04:11:37,0
store a

116
04:11:37,0 --> 04:11:37,0
blessing such as is

117
04:11:37,0 --> 04:11:37,0
not known among

118
04:11:37,0 --> 04:11:37,0
the children

119
04:11:37,0 --> 04:11:37,0
of men, and it

120
04:11:37,0 --> 04:11:37,0
shall be

121
04:11:37,0 --> 04:11:37,0
poured forth upon

122
04:11:37,0 --> 04:11:37,0
their heads.

123
04:11:37,0 --> 04:11:37,0
And from thence

124
04:11:37,0 --> 04:11:37,0
men shall go

125
04:11:37,0 --> 04:12:41,
forth into all nations.

126
04:12:41,0 --> 04:12:41,0
16 Behold,

127
04:12:41,0 --> 04:12:41,0
verily, verily,

128
04:12:41,0 --> 04:12:41,0
I say unto

129
04:12:41,0 --> 04:12:41,0
you, that the

130
04:12:41,0 --> 04:12:41,0
people in

131
04:12:41,0 --> 04:12:41,0
Ohio call upon

132
04:12:41,0 --> 04:12:41,0
me in much

133
04:12:41,0 --> 04:12:41,0
faith, thinking

134
04:12:41,0 --> 04:12:41,0
I will stay

135
04:12:41,0 --> 04:12:41,0
my hand in

136
04:12:41,0 --> 04:12:41,0
judgment upon

137
04:12:41,0 --> 04:12:41,0
the nations,

138
04:12:41,0 --> 04:21:43,
but I cannot deny my word.

139
04:21:43,0 --> 04:21:43,0
17 Wherefore

140
04:21:43,0 --> 04:21:43,0
lay to with

141
04:21:43,0 --> 04:21:43,0
your might

142
04:21:43,0 --> 04:21:43,0
and call

143
04:21:43,0 --> 04:21:43,0
faithful

144
04:21:43,0 --> 04:21:43,0
laborers into my

145
04:21:43,0 --> 04:21:43,0
vineyard,

146
04:21:43,0 --> 04:21:43,0
that it may be

147
04:21:43,0 --> 04:21:43,0
pruned for

148
04:21:43,0 --> 04:48:41,
the last time.

149
04:48:41,0 --> 04:48:41,0
18 And

150
04:48:41,0 --> 04:48:41,0
inasmuch as

151
04:48:41,0 --> 04:48:41,0
they do repent

152
04:48:41,0 --> 04:48:41,0
and

153
04:48:41,0 --> 04:48:41,0
receive the

154
04:48:41,0 --> 04:48:41,0
fulness of my

155
04:48:41,0 --> 04:48:41,0
gospel, and

156
04:48:41,0 --> 04:48:41,0
become

157
04:48:41,0 --> 04:48:41,0
sanctified, I

158
04:48:41,0 --> 04:48:41,0
will stay

159
04:48:41,0 --> 05:21:41,
mine hand in judgment.

160
05:21:41,0 --> 05:21:41,0
19

161
05:21:41,0 --> 05:21:41,0
Wherefore, go

162
05:21:41,0 --> 05:21:41,0
forth, crying

163
05:21:41,0 --> 05:21:41,0
with a

164
05:21:41,0 --> 05:21:41,0
loud voice,

165
05:21:41,0 --> 05:21:41,0
saying:

166
05:21:41,0 --> 05:21:41,0
The kingdom

167
05:21:41,0 --> 05:21:41,0
of heaven

168
05:21:41,0 --> 05:21:41,0
is at

169
05:21:41,0 --> 05:21:41,0
hand; crying:

170
05:21:41,0 --> 05:21:41,0
Hosanna!

171
05:21:41,0 --> 05:21:41,0
blessed be

172
05:21:41,0 --> 05:21:41,0
the name

173
05:21:41,0 --> 05:54:40,
of the Most High God.

174
05:54:40,0 --> 05:54:40,0
20 Go

175
05:54:40,0 --> 05:54:40,0
forth

176
05:54:40,0 --> 05:54:40,0
baptizing with

177
05:54:40,0 --> 05:54:40,0
water,

178
05:54:40,0 --> 05:54:40,0
preparing

179
05:54:40,0 --> 05:54:40,0
the way

180
05:54:40,0 --> 05:54:40,0
before my

181
05:54:40,0 --> 05:54:40,0
face for

182
05:54:40,0 --> 05:54:40,0
the time

183
05:54:40,0 --> 06:01:43,
of my coming;

184
06:01:43,0 --> 06:01:43,0
21 For

185
06:01:43,0 --> 06:01:43,0
the time

186
06:01:43,0 --> 06:01:43,0
is at

187
06:01:43,0 --> 06:01:43,0
hand; the

188
06:01:43,0 --> 06:01:43,0
day or

189
06:01:43,0 --> 06:01:43,0
the hour

190
06:01:43,0 --> 06:01:43,0
no man

191
06:01:43,0 --> 06:01:43,0
knoweth;

192
06:01:43,0 --> 06:01:43,0
but it

193
06:01:43,0 --> 06:06:20,
surely shall come.

194
06:06:20,0 --> 06:06:20,0
22 And

195
06:06:20,0 --> 06:06:20,0
he that

196
06:06:20,0 --> 06:06:20,0


197
06:06:20,0 --> 06:06:20,0
receiveth

198
06:06:20,0 --> 06:06:20,0
these

199
06:06:20,0 --> 06:06:20,0
things

200
06:06:20,0 --> 06:06:20,0
receiveth

201
06:06:20,0 --> 06:06:20,0
me; and

202
06:06:20,0 --> 06:06:20,0
they

203
06:06:20,0 --> 06:06:20,0
shall be

204
06:06:20,0 --> 06:06:20,0


205
06:06:20,0 --> 06:06:20,0
gathered unto

206
06:06:20,0 --> 06:06:20,0
me in

207
06:06:20,0 --> 06:12:25,
time and in eternity.

208
06:12:25,0 --> 06:12:25,0
23 And

209
06:12:25,0 --> 06:12:25,0


210
06:12:25,0 --> 06:12:25,0
again, it

211
06:12:25,0 --> 06:12:25,0
shall

212
06:12:25,0 --> 06:12:25,0
come to

213
06:12:25,0 --> 06:12:25,0
pass

214
06:12:25,0 --> 06:12:25,0
that

215
06:12:25,0 --> 06:12:25,0
on as

216
06:12:25,0 --> 06:12:25,0
many as

217
06:12:25,0 --> 06:12:25,0
ye

218
06:12:25,0 --> 06:12:25,0
shall

219
06:12:25,0 --> 06:12:25,0
baptize

220
06:12:25,0 --> 06:12:25,0
with

221
06:12:25,0 --> 06:12:25,0
water,

222
06:12:25,0 --> 06:12:25,0

06:12:25,0 --> 06:12:25,0
hands,

226
06:12:25,0 --> 06:12:25,0
and

227
06:12:25,0 --> 06:12:25,0
they

Holy

234
06:12:25,0 --> 06:12:25,0
Ghost,

235
06:12:25,0 --> 06:12:25,0

shall be

237
06:12:25,0 --> 06:12:25,0
looking

238
06:12:25,0 --> 06:12:25,0
forth

239
06:12:25,0 --> 06:12:25,0

signs of my coming, and shall know me.

242
06:11:29,0 --> 06:11:29,0
24

243
06:11:29,0 --> 06:11:29,0
Behold, I

244

come

245
06:11:29,0 --> 06:11:29,0


246
06:11:29,0 --> 06:11:29,0
quickly.

247
06:11:29,0 --> 06:11:29,0
Even so.

248
06:11:29,0 --> 06:13:33,
