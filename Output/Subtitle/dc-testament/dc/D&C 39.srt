00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:02,0
Section 39 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:02,0 --> 00:00:04,0
the Prophet to James Covel, at Fayette, New York,

3
00:00:04,0 --> 00:00:06,0
January 5, 1831. James Covel, who had been a

4
00:00:06,0 --> 00:00:08,0
Methodist minister for about forty years, covenanted

5
00:00:08,0 --> 00:00:10,0
with the Lord that he would obey any command

6
00:00:10,0 --> 00:00:12,0
that the Lord would give to him through Joseph the

7
00:00:12,0 --> 00:00:14,0
Prophet. 
1–4, The Saints have power to become the

8
00:00:14,0 --> 00:00:16,0
sons of God; 
5–6, To receive the gospel is to

9
00:00:16,0 --> 00:00:18,0
receive Christ; 
7–14, James Covel is commanded to

10
00:00:18,0 --> 00:00:20,0
be baptized and labor in the Lord’s vineyard;

11
00:00:20,0 --> 00:00:22,0
15–21, The Lord’s servants are to preach the

12
00:00:22,0 --> 00:00:24,0
gospel before the Second Coming; 
22–24, Those who

13
00:00:24,0 --> 00:00:26,994
receive the gospel will be gathered in time and in eternity. 

14
00:00:26,994 --> 00:00:33,327
1 Hearken and listen to the voice of

15
00:00:33,327 --> 00:00:39,66
him who is from all eternity to all

16
00:00:39,66 --> 00:00:45,996
eternity, the Great I Am, even Jesus Christ—

17
00:00:45,996 --> 00:01:03,996
2 The light and the life of the

18
00:01:03,996 --> 00:01:21,996
world; a light which shineth in darkness

19
00:01:21,996 --> 00:01:39,032
and the darkness comprehendeth it not;

20
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:44,032
3 The same which came in the

21
00:01:44,032 --> 00:01:49,032
meridian of time unto mine own,

22
00:01:49,032 --> 00:01:54,081
and mine own received me not;

23
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:55,481
4 But to as many as received

24
00:01:55,481 --> 00:01:56,881
me, gave I power to become my

25
00:01:56,881 --> 00:01:58,281
sons; and even so will I

26
00:01:58,281 --> 00:01:59,681
give unto as many as will

27
00:01:59,681 --> 00:02:01,121
receive me, power to become my sons.

28
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:05,721
5 And verily, verily, I

29
00:02:05,721 --> 00:02:10,321
say unto you, he that

30
00:02:10,321 --> 00:02:14,921
receiveth my gospel receiveth

31
00:02:14,921 --> 00:02:19,521
me; and he that receiveth

32
00:02:19,521 --> 00:02:24,144
not my gospel receiveth not me.

33
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,394
6 And this is my

34
00:02:26,394 --> 00:02:28,644
gospel—repentance and baptism by

35
00:02:28,644 --> 00:02:30,894
water, and then cometh the

36
00:02:30,894 --> 00:02:33,144
baptism of fire and the

37
00:02:33,144 --> 00:02:35,394
Holy Ghost, even the

38
00:02:35,394 --> 00:02:37,644
Comforter, which showeth all

39
00:02:37,644 --> 00:02:39,894
things, and teacheth the

40
00:02:39,894 --> 00:02:42,195
peaceable things of the kingdom.

41
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:43,195
7 And now, behold, I say

42
00:02:43,195 --> 00:02:44,195
unto you, my servant

43
00:02:44,195 --> 00:02:45,195
James, I have looked upon

44
00:02:45,195 --> 00:02:46,316
thy works and I know thee.

45
00:02:46,316 --> 00:02:48,483
8 And verily I say unto

46
00:02:48,483 --> 00:02:50,65
thee, thine heart is

47
00:02:50,65 --> 00:02:52,817
now right before me at

48
00:02:52,817 --> 00:02:54,984
this time; and, behold,

49
00:02:54,984 --> 00:02:57,151
I have bestowed great

50
00:02:57,151 --> 00:02:59,396
blessings upon thy head;

51
00:02:59,396 --> 00:03:04,063
9 Nevertheless, thou

52
00:03:04,063 --> 00:03:08,73
hast seen great

53
00:03:08,73 --> 00:03:13,397
sorrow, for thou hast

54
00:03:13,397 --> 00:03:18,064
rejected me many times

55
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:22,731
because of pride and

56
00:03:22,731 --> 00:03:27,491
the cares of the world.

57
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:28,26
10 But, behold, the

58
00:03:28,26 --> 00:03:29,029
days of thy

59
00:03:29,029 --> 00:03:29,798
deliverance are come, if

60
00:03:29,798 --> 00:03:30,567
thou wilt hearken to my

61
00:03:30,567 --> 00:03:31,336
voice, which saith

62
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,105
unto thee: Arise and

63
00:03:32,105 --> 00:03:32,874
be baptized, and

64
00:03:32,874 --> 00:03:33,643
wash away your sins,

65
00:03:33,643 --> 00:03:34,412
calling on my name,

66
00:03:34,412 --> 00:03:35,181
and you shall receive

67
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:35,95
my Spirit, and a

68
00:03:35,95 --> 00:03:36,719
blessing so great as

69
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:37,534
you never have known.

70
00:03:37,534 --> 00:03:37,842
11 And if thou do

71
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:38,15
this, I have

72
00:03:38,15 --> 00:03:38,458
prepared thee for a

73
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:38,766
greater work. Thou

74
00:03:38,766 --> 00:03:39,074
shalt preach the

75
00:03:39,074 --> 00:03:39,382
fulness of my gospel,

76
00:03:39,382 --> 00:03:39,69
which I have sent

77
00:03:39,69 --> 00:03:39,998
forth in these

78
00:03:39,998 --> 00:03:40,306
last days, the

79
00:03:40,306 --> 00:03:40,614
covenant which I have

80
00:03:40,614 --> 00:03:40,922
sent forth to

81
00:03:40,922 --> 00:03:41,23
recover my people,

82
00:03:41,23 --> 00:03:41,188
which are of the house of Israel.

83
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:43,063
12 And it shall

84
00:03:43,063 --> 00:03:44,938
come to pass that

85
00:03:44,938 --> 00:03:46,813
power shall rest

86
00:03:46,813 --> 00:03:48,688
upon thee; thou

87
00:03:48,688 --> 00:03:50,563
shalt have great

88
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,438
faith, and I will

89
00:03:52,438 --> 00:03:54,313
be with thee and

90
00:03:54,313 --> 00:03:56,236
go before thy face.

91
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,125
13 Thou art

92
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:00,014
called to labor in

93
00:04:00,014 --> 00:04:01,903
my vineyard, and

94
00:04:01,903 --> 00:04:03,792
to build up my

95
00:04:03,792 --> 00:04:05,681
church, and to

96
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:07,57
bring forth Zion,

97
00:04:07,57 --> 00:04:09,459
that it may

98
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:11,348
rejoice upon the

99
00:04:11,348 --> 00:04:13,286
hills and flourish.

100
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:17,175
14 Behold,

101
00:04:17,175 --> 00:04:21,064
verily, verily, I

102
00:04:21,064 --> 00:04:24,953
say unto thee,

103
00:04:24,953 --> 00:04:28,842
thou art not

104
00:04:28,842 --> 00:04:32,731
called to go into

105
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:36,62
the eastern

106
00:04:36,62 --> 00:04:40,509
countries, but

107
00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:44,398
thou art called to

108
00:04:44,398 --> 00:04:48,905
go to the Ohio.

109
00:04:48,905 --> 00:04:49,611
15 And

110
00:04:49,611 --> 00:04:50,317
inasmuch as my people

111
00:04:50,317 --> 00:04:51,023
shall

112
00:04:51,023 --> 00:04:51,729
assemble themselves

113
00:04:51,729 --> 00:04:52,435
at the Ohio, I

114
00:04:52,435 --> 00:04:53,141
have kept in

115
00:04:53,141 --> 00:04:53,847
store a

116
00:04:53,847 --> 00:04:54,553
blessing such as is

117
00:04:54,553 --> 00:04:55,259
not known among

118
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:55,965
the children

119
00:04:55,965 --> 00:04:56,671
of men, and it

120
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:57,377
shall be

121
00:04:57,377 --> 00:04:58,083
poured forth upon

122
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:58,789
their heads.

123
00:04:58,789 --> 00:04:59,495
And from thence

124
00:04:59,495 --> 00:05:00,201
men shall go

125
00:05:00,201 --> 00:05:00,534
forth into all nations.

126
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:00,611
16 Behold,

127
00:05:00,611 --> 00:05:00,688
verily, verily,

128
00:05:00,688 --> 00:05:00,765
I say unto

129
00:05:00,765 --> 00:05:00,842
you, that the

130
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:00,919
people in

131
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:00,996
Ohio call upon

132
00:05:00,996 --> 00:05:01,073
me in much

133
00:05:01,073 --> 00:05:01,15
faith, thinking

134
00:05:01,15 --> 00:05:01,227
I will stay

135
00:05:01,227 --> 00:05:01,304
my hand in

136
00:05:01,304 --> 00:05:01,381
judgment upon

137
00:05:01,381 --> 00:05:01,458
the nations,

138
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:01,601
but I cannot deny my word.

139
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,701
17 Wherefore

140
00:05:03,701 --> 00:05:05,801
lay to with

141
00:05:05,801 --> 00:05:07,901
your might

142
00:05:07,901 --> 00:05:10,001
and call

143
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:12,101
faithful

144
00:05:12,101 --> 00:05:14,201
laborers into my

145
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:16,301
vineyard,

146
00:05:16,301 --> 00:05:18,401
that it may be

147
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,501
pruned for

148
00:05:20,501 --> 00:05:22,672
the last time.

149
00:05:22,672 --> 00:05:24,399
18 And

150
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:26,126
inasmuch as

151
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:27,853
they do repent

152
00:05:27,853 --> 00:05:29,58
and

153
00:05:29,58 --> 00:05:31,307
receive the

154
00:05:31,307 --> 00:05:33,034
fulness of my

155
00:05:33,034 --> 00:05:34,761
gospel, and

156
00:05:34,761 --> 00:05:36,488
become

157
00:05:36,488 --> 00:05:38,215
sanctified, I

158
00:05:38,215 --> 00:05:39,942
will stay

159
00:05:39,942 --> 00:05:41,675
mine hand in judgment.

160
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:41,818
19

161
00:05:41,818 --> 00:05:41,961
Wherefore, go

162
00:05:41,961 --> 00:05:42,104
forth, crying

163
00:05:42,104 --> 00:05:42,247
with a

164
00:05:42,247 --> 00:05:42,39
loud voice,

165
00:05:42,39 --> 00:05:42,533
saying:

166
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:42,676
The kingdom

167
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:42,819
of heaven

168
00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:42,962
is at

169
00:05:42,962 --> 00:05:43,105
hand; crying:

170
00:05:43,105 --> 00:05:43,248
Hosanna!

171
00:05:43,248 --> 00:05:43,391
blessed be

172
00:05:43,391 --> 00:05:43,534
the name

173
00:05:43,534 --> 00:05:43,743
of the Most High God.

174
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:45,643
20 Go

175
00:05:45,643 --> 00:05:47,543
forth

176
00:05:47,543 --> 00:05:49,443
baptizing with

177
00:05:49,443 --> 00:05:51,343
water,

178
00:05:51,343 --> 00:05:53,243
preparing

179
00:05:53,243 --> 00:05:55,143
the way

180
00:05:55,143 --> 00:05:57,043
before my

181
00:05:57,043 --> 00:05:58,943
face for

182
00:05:58,943 --> 00:06:00,843
the time

183
00:06:00,843 --> 00:06:02,762
of my coming;

184
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:03,962
21 For

185
00:06:03,962 --> 00:06:05,162
the time

186
00:06:05,162 --> 00:06:06,362
is at

187
00:06:06,362 --> 00:06:07,562
hand; the

188
00:06:07,562 --> 00:06:08,762
day or

189
00:06:08,762 --> 00:06:09,962
the hour

190
00:06:09,962 --> 00:06:11,162
no man

191
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,362
knoweth;

192
00:06:12,362 --> 00:06:13,562
but it

193
00:06:13,562 --> 00:06:14,875
surely shall come.

194
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,875
22 And

195
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,875
he that

196
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,875


197
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,875
receiveth

198
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,875
these

199
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,875
things

200
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,875
