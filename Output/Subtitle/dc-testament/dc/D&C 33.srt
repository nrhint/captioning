Section 33 Revelation given through Joseph

2
00:00:08,0 --> 00:00:16,0
Smith the Prophet to Ezra Thayre and Northrop

3
00:00:16,0 --> 00:00:24,0
Sweet, at Fayette, New York, October 1830. In

4
00:00:24,0 --> 00:00:32,0
introducing this revelation, Joseph Smith’s

5
00:00:32,0 --> 00:00:40,0
history affirms that “the Lord … is ever ready to

6
00:00:40,0 --> 00:00:48,0
instruct such as diligently seek in faith.”

7
00:00:48,0 --> 00:00:56,0
1–4, Laborers are called to declare the gospel

8
00:00:56,0 --> 00:01:04,0
in the eleventh hour; 
5–6, The Church is

9
00:01:04,0 --> 00:01:12,0
established, and the elect are to be gathered;

10
00:01:12,0 --> 00:01:20,0
7–10, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at

11
00:01:20,0 --> 00:01:28,0
hand; 
11–15, The Church is built upon the gospel

12
00:01:28,0 --> 00:01:36,964
rock; 
16–18, Prepare for the coming of the Bridegroom. 

13
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:41,964
1 Behold, I say unto you, my servants Ezra

14
00:01:41,964 --> 00:01:46,964
and Northrop, open ye your ears and hearken to

15
00:01:46,964 --> 00:01:51,964
the voice of the Lord your God, whose word is

16
00:01:51,964 --> 00:01:56,964
quick and powerful, sharper than a two-edged

17
00:01:56,964 --> 00:02:01,964
sword, to the dividing asunder of the joints

18
00:02:01,964 --> 00:02:06,964
and marrow, soul and spirit; and is a

19
00:02:06,964 --> 00:02:11,948
discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.

20
00:02:11,948 --> 00:02:12,448
2 For verily, verily, I say unto you that

21
00:02:12,448 --> 00:02:12,948
ye are called to lift up your voices as

22
00:02:12,948 --> 00:02:13,448
with the sound of a trump, to declare my

23
00:02:13,448 --> 00:02:13,016
gospel unto a crooked and perverse generation.

24
00:02:13,016 --> 00:02:14,766
3 For behold, the field is white

25
00:02:14,766 --> 00:02:16,516
already to harvest; and it is the

26
00:02:16,516 --> 00:02:18,266
eleventh hour, and the last time that I

27
00:02:18,266 --> 00:02:20,073
shall call laborers into my vineyard.

28
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:23,573
4 And my vineyard has become

29
00:02:23,573 --> 00:02:27,073
corrupted every whit; and there

30
00:02:27,073 --> 00:02:30,573
is none which doeth good save

31
00:02:30,573 --> 00:02:34,073
it be a few; and they err in

32
00:02:34,073 --> 00:02:37,573
many instances because of

33
00:02:37,573 --> 00:02:41,144
priestcrafts, all having corrupt minds.

34
00:02:41,144 --> 00:02:40,894
5 And verily, verily, I say

35
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:40,644
unto you, that this church

36
00:02:40,644 --> 00:02:40,394
have I established and called

37
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:40,777
forth out of the wilderness.

38
00:02:40,777 --> 00:02:39,977
6 And even so will I gather

39
00:02:39,977 --> 00:02:39,177
mine elect from the four

40
00:02:39,177 --> 00:02:38,377
quarters of the earth, even

41
00:02:38,377 --> 00:02:37,577
as many as will believe in

42
00:02:37,577 --> 00:02:36,44
me, and hearken unto my voice.

43
00:02:36,44 --> 00:02:37,154
7 Yea, verily, verily,

44
00:02:37,154 --> 00:02:37,868
I say unto you, that

45
00:02:37,868 --> 00:02:38,582
the field is white

46
00:02:38,582 --> 00:02:39,296
already to harvest;

47
00:02:39,296 --> 00:02:40,01
wherefore, thrust in your

48
00:02:40,01 --> 00:02:40,724
sickles, and reap with all

49
00:02:40,724 --> 00:02:41,528
your might, mind, and strength.

50
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:44,861
8 Open your mouths and

51
00:02:44,861 --> 00:02:48,194
they shall be filled,

52
00:02:48,194 --> 00:02:51,527
and you shall become

53
00:02:51,527 --> 00:02:54,86
even as Nephi of old,

54
00:02:54,86 --> 00:02:58,193
who journeyed from

55
00:02:58,193 --> 00:03:01,164
Jerusalem in the wilderness.

56
00:03:01,164 --> 00:03:05,331
9 Yea, open your

57
00:03:05,331 --> 00:03:09,498
mouths and spare not,

58
00:03:09,498 --> 00:03:13,665
and you shall be

59
00:03:13,665 --> 00:03:17,832
laden with sheaves

60
00:03:17,832 --> 00:03:21,999
upon your backs, for

61
00:03:21,999 --> 00:03:26,206
lo, I am with you.

62
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:26,506
10 Yea, open your

63
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:26,806
mouths and they

64
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:27,106
shall be filled,

65
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:27,406
saying: Repent,

66
00:03:27,406 --> 00:03:27,706
repent, and

67
00:03:27,706 --> 00:03:28,006
prepare ye the way of

68
00:03:28,006 --> 00:03:28,306
the Lord, and make

69
00:03:28,306 --> 00:03:28,606
his paths

70
00:03:28,606 --> 00:03:28,906
straight; for the

71
00:03:28,906 --> 00:03:29,86
kingdom of heaven is at hand;

72
00:03:29,86 --> 00:03:30,86
11 Yea, repent

73
00:03:30,86 --> 00:03:31,86
and be baptized,

74
00:03:31,86 --> 00:03:32,86
every one of you,

75
00:03:32,86 --> 00:03:33,86
for a remission of

76
00:03:33,86 --> 00:03:34,86
your sins; yea,

77
00:03:34,86 --> 00:03:35,86
be baptized even

78
00:03:35,86 --> 00:03:36,86
by water, and

79
00:03:36,86 --> 00:03:37,86
then cometh the

80
00:03:37,86 --> 00:03:38,86
baptism of fire and

81
00:03:38,86 --> 00:03:39,92
of the Holy Ghost.

82
00:03:39,92 --> 00:03:39,92
12 Behold,

83
00:03:39,92 --> 00:03:39,92

84
00:03:39,92 --> 00:03:39,92
say unto you,

85
00:03:39,92 --> 00:03:39,92
this is my

86
00:03:39,92 --> 00:03:39,92
gospel; and remember

87
00:03:39,92 --> 00:03:39,92
that they shall

88
00:03:39,92 --> 00:03:39,92
have faith in

89
00:03:39,92 --> 00:03:39,92
me or they can

90
00:03:39,92 --> 00:03:39,553
in nowise be saved;

91
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:40,653
13 And upon

92
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:41,753
this rock I will

93
00:03:41,753 --> 00:03:42,853

94
00:03:42,853 --> 00:03:43,953
church; yea, upon

95
00:03:43,953 --> 00:03:45,053
this rock ye

97
00:03:46,153 --> 00:03:47,253
if ye

98
00:03:47,253 --> 00:03:48,353

99
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,453
hell shall

100
00:03:49,453 --> 00:03:50,564
not prevail against you.

101
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,731
14 And ye

102
00:03:52,731 --> 00:03:54,898
