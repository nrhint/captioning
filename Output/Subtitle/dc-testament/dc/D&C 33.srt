00:00:18,445 --> 00:00:25,612
 the Prophet to Ezra Thayre and Northrop Sweet, at

3
00:00:25,612 --> 00:00:32,779
 Fayette, New York, October 1830. In introducing

4
00:00:32,779 --> 00:00:39,946
 this revelation, Joseph Smith’s history affirms that

5
00:00:39,946 --> 00:00:47,113
 “the Lord … is ever ready to instruct such as

6
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:54,28
 diligently seek in faith.” 
1–4, Laborers are called

7
00:00:54,28 --> 00:01:01,447
 to declare the gospel in the eleventh hour; 
5–6,

8
00:01:01,447 --> 00:01:08,614
 The Church is established, and the elect are to be

9
00:01:08,614 --> 00:01:15,781
 gathered; 
7–10, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven

10
00:01:15,781 --> 00:01:22,948
 is at hand; 
11–15, The Church is built upon the

11
00:01:22,948 --> 00:01:30,115
 gospel rock; 
16–18, Prepare for the coming of the

12
00:01:30,115 --> 00:01:37,282
 Bridegroom.

13
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:43,824
1 Behold, I say unto you, my servants Ezra and

14
00:01:43,824 --> 00:01:49,967
 Northrop, open ye your ears and hearken to the voice

15
00:01:49,967 --> 00:01:56,11
 of the Lord your God, whose word is quick and

16
00:01:56,11 --> 00:02:02,253
 powerful, sharper than a two-edged sword, to the

17
00:02:02,253 --> 00:02:08,396
 dividing asunder of the joints and marrow, soul and

18
00:02:08,396 --> 00:02:14,539
 spirit; and is a discerner of the thoughts and

19
00:02:14,539 --> 00:02:20,682
 intents of the heart

20
00:02:20,424 --> 00:02:25,924
2 For verily, verily, I say unto you that ye are

21
00:02:25,924 --> 00:02:31,424
 called to lift up your voices as with the sound of

22
00:02:31,424 --> 00:02:36,924
 a trump, to declare my gospel unto a crooked and

23
00:02:36,924 --> 00:02:42,424
 perverse generation

24
00:02:42,179 --> 00:02:48,512
3 For behold, the field is white already to

25
00:02:48,512 --> 00:02:54,845
 harvest; and it is the eleventh hour, and the last time

26
00:02:54,845 --> 00:03:01,178
 that I shall call laborers into my vineyard

27
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:08,432
4 And my vineyard has become corrupted every whit;

28
00:03:08,432 --> 00:03:14,932
 and there is none which doeth good save it be a

29
00:03:14,932 --> 00:03:21,432
 few; and they err in many instances because of

30
00:03:21,432 --> 00:03:27,932
 priestcrafts, all having corrupt minds

31
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:32,274
5 And verily, verily, I say unto you, that this

32
00:03:32,274 --> 00:03:36,607
 church have I established and called forth out of

33
00:03:36,607 --> 00:03:40,94
 the wilderness

34
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:48,388
6 And even so will I gather mine elect from the

35
00:03:48,388 --> 00:03:56,055
 four quarters of the earth, even as many as will

36
00:03:56,055 --> 00:04:03,722
 believe in me, and hearken unto my voice

37
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:09,477
7 Yea, verily, verily, I say unto you, that the

38
00:04:09,477 --> 00:04:14,977
 field is white already to harvest; wherefore, thrust

39
00:04:14,977 --> 00:04:20,477
 in your sickles, and reap with all your might,

40
00:04:20,477 --> 00:04:25,977
 mind, and strength

41
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:30,999
8 Open your mouths and they shall be filled, and

42
00:04:30,999 --> 00:04:36,666
 you shall become even as Nephi of old, who

43
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:42,333
 journeyed from Jerusalem in the wilderness

44
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:49,365
9 Yea, open your mouths and spare not, and you

45
00:04:49,365 --> 00:04:56,365
 shall be laden with sheaves upon your backs, for lo,

46
00:04:56,365 --> 00:05:03,365
 I am with you

47
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:15,403
10 Yea, open your mouths and they shall be filled,

48
00:05:15,403 --> 00:05:27,403
 saying: Repent, repent, and prepare ye the way of

49
00:05:27,403 --> 00:05:39,403
 the Lord, and make his paths straight; for the

50
00:05:39,403 --> 00:05:51,403
 kingdom of heaven is at hand

51
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:51,351
11 Yea, repent and be baptized, every one of you,

52
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:51,351
 for a remission of your sins; yea, be baptized

53
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:51,351
 even by water, and then cometh the baptism of fire

54
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:51,351
 and of the Holy Ghost

55
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:55,352
12 Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, this is

56
00:05:55,352 --> 00:05:59,019
 my gospel; and remember that they shall have

57
00:05:59,019 --> 00:06:02,686
 faith in me or they can in nowise be saved

58
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:09,963
13 And upon this rock I will build my church; yea,

59
00:06:09,963 --> 00:06:16,963
 upon this rock ye are built, and if ye continue,

60
00:06:16,963 --> 00:06:23,963
 the gates of hell shall not prevail against you

61
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:28,967
14 And ye shall remember the church articles and

62
00:06:28,967 --> 00:06:33,967
 covenants to keep them

63
00:06:33,26 --> 00:06:38,927
15 And whoso having faith you shall confirm in my

64
00:06:38,927 --> 00:06:44,594
 church, by the laying on of the hands, and I will

65
00:06:44,594 --> 00:06:50,261
 bestow the gift of the Holy Ghost upon them

66
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:55,376
16 And the Book of Mormon and the holy scriptures

67
00:06:55,376 --> 00:07:00,709
 are given of me for your instruction; and the

68
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:06,042
 power of my Spirit quickeneth all things

69
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:12,826
17 Wherefore, be faithful, praying always, having

70
00:07:12,826 --> 00:07:18,826
 your lamps trimmed and burning, and oil with you,

71
00:07:18,826 --> 00:07:24,826
 that you may be ready at the coming of the

72
00:07:24,826 --> 00:07:30,826
 Bridegroom

73
00:07:30,8 --> 00:07:38,8
18 For behold, verily, verily, I say unto you,

74
00:07:38,8 --> 00:07:46,8
 that I come quickly. Even so. Amen.
