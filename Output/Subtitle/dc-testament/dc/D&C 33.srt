Section 33 Revelation given through Joseph

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Smith the Prophet to Ezra Thayre and Northrop

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Sweet, at Fayette, New York, October 1830. In

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
introducing this revelation, Joseph Smith’s

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
history affirms that “the Lord … is ever ready to

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
instruct such as diligently seek in faith.”

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
1–4, Laborers are called to declare the gospel

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
in the eleventh hour; 
5–6, The Church is

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
established, and the elect are to be gathered;

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
7–10, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
hand; 
11–15, The Church is built upon the gospel

12
00:00:00,0 --> 01:36:52,
rock; 
16–18, Prepare for the coming of the Bridegroom. 

13
01:36:52,0 --> 01:36:52,0
1 Behold, I say unto you, my servants Ezra

14
01:36:52,0 --> 01:36:52,0
and Northrop, open ye your ears and hearken to

15
01:36:52,0 --> 01:36:52,0
the voice of the Lord your God, whose word is

16
01:36:52,0 --> 01:36:52,0
quick and powerful, sharper than a two-edged

17
01:36:52,0 --> 01:36:52,0
sword, to the dividing asunder of the joints

18
01:36:52,0 --> 01:36:52,0
and marrow, soul and spirit; and is a

19
01:36:52,0 --> 01:36:30,
discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.

20
01:36:30,0 --> 01:36:30,0
2 For verily, verily, I say unto you that

21
01:36:30,0 --> 01:36:30,0
ye are called to lift up your voices as

22
01:36:30,0 --> 01:36:30,0
with the sound of a trump, to declare my

23
01:36:30,0 --> 01:47:30,
gospel unto a crooked and perverse generation.

24
01:47:30,0 --> 01:47:30,0
3 For behold, the field is white

25
01:47:30,0 --> 01:47:30,0
already to harvest; and it is the

26
01:47:30,0 --> 01:47:30,0
eleventh hour, and the last time that I

27
01:47:30,0 --> 02:18:29,
shall call laborers into my vineyard.

28
02:18:29,0 --> 02:18:29,0
4 And my vineyard has become

29
02:18:29,0 --> 02:18:29,0
corrupted every whit; and there

30
02:18:29,0 --> 02:18:29,0
is none which doeth good save

31
02:18:29,0 --> 02:18:29,0
it be a few; and they err in

32
02:18:29,0 --> 02:18:29,0
many instances because of

33
02:18:29,0 --> 02:14:09,
priestcrafts, all having corrupt minds.

34
02:14:09,0 --> 02:14:09,0
5 And verily, verily, I say

35
02:14:09,0 --> 02:14:09,0
unto you, that this church

36
02:14:09,0 --> 02:14:09,0
have I established and called

37
02:14:09,0 --> 02:19:14,
forth out of the wilderness.

38
02:19:14,0 --> 02:19:14,0
6 And even so will I gather

39
02:19:14,0 --> 02:19:14,0
mine elect from the four

40
02:19:14,0 --> 02:19:14,0
quarters of the earth, even

41
02:19:14,0 --> 02:19:14,0
as many as will believe in

42
02:19:14,0 --> 02:41:17,
me, and hearken unto my voice.

43
02:41:17,0 --> 02:41:17,0
7 Yea, verily, verily,

44
02:41:17,0 --> 02:41:17,0
I say unto you, that

45
02:41:17,0 --> 02:41:17,0
the field is white

46
02:41:17,0 --> 02:41:17,0
already to harvest;

47
02:41:17,0 --> 02:41:17,0
wherefore, thrust in your

48
02:41:17,0 --> 02:41:17,0
sickles, and reap with all

49
02:41:17,0 --> 03:01:22,
your might, mind, and strength.

50
03:01:22,0 --> 03:01:22,0
8 Open your mouths and

51
03:01:22,0 --> 03:01:22,0
they shall be filled,

52
03:01:22,0 --> 03:01:22,0
and you shall become

53
03:01:22,0 --> 03:01:22,0
even as Nephi of old,

54
03:01:22,0 --> 03:01:22,0
who journeyed from

55
03:01:22,0 --> 03:23:25,
Jerusalem in the wilderness.

56
03:23:25,0 --> 03:23:25,0
9 Yea, open your

57
03:23:25,0 --> 03:23:25,0
mouths and spare not,

58
03:23:25,0 --> 03:23:25,0
and you shall be

59
03:23:25,0 --> 03:23:25,0
laden with sheaves

60
03:23:25,0 --> 03:23:25,0
upon your backs, for

61
03:23:25,0 --> 03:27:04,
lo, I am with you.

62
03:27:04,0 --> 03:27:04,0
10 Yea, open your

63
03:27:04,0 --> 03:27:04,0
mouths and they

64
03:27:04,0 --> 03:27:04,0
shall be filled,

65
03:27:04,0 --> 03:27:04,0
saying: Repent,

66
03:27:04,0 --> 03:27:04,0
repent, and

67
03:27:04,0 --> 03:27:04,0
prepare ye the way of

68
03:27:04,0 --> 03:27:04,0
the Lord, and make

69
03:27:04,0 --> 03:27:04,0
his paths

70
03:27:04,0 --> 03:27:04,0
straight; for the

71
03:27:04,0 --> 03:39:40,
kingdom of heaven is at hand;

72
03:39:40,0 --> 03:39:40,0
11 Yea, repent

73
03:39:40,0 --> 03:39:40,0
and be baptized,

74
03:39:40,0 --> 03:39:40,0
every one of you,

75
03:39:40,0 --> 03:39:40,0
for a remission of

76
03:39:40,0 --> 03:39:40,0
your sins; yea,

77
03:39:40,0 --> 03:39:40,0
be baptized even

78
03:39:40,0 --> 03:39:40,0
by water, and

79
03:39:40,0 --> 03:39:40,0
then cometh the

80
03:39:40,0 --> 03:39:40,0
baptism of fire and

81
03:39:40,0 --> 04:02:41,
of the Holy Ghost.

82
04:02:41,0 --> 04:02:41,0
12 Behold,

84
04:02:41,0 --> 04:02:41,0
say unto you,

85
04:02:41,0 --> 04:02:41,0
this is my

86
04:02:41,0 --> 04:02:41,0
gospel; and remember

87
04:02:41,0 --> 04:02:41,0

me or they can

90
04:02:41,0 --> 04:13:42,
in nowise be saved;

91
04:13:42,0 --> 04:13:42,0
13 And upon

92
04:13:42,0 --> 04:13:42,0
this rock I will

93
04:13:42,0 --> 04:13:42,0
build my

94
04:13:42,0 --> 04:13:42,0
church; yea, upon

04:13:42,0 --> 04:13:42,0
if ye

98
04:13:42,0 --> 04:13:42,0

04:13:42,0 --> 04:13:42,0
hell shall

100
04:13:42,0 --> 04:24:43,

04:24:43,0 --> 04:24:43,0
14 And ye
