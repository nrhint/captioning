 the paradise of God, the happiness of man, and of

17
00:00:32,302 --> 00:00:33,616
 beasts, and of creeping things, and of the fowls of

18
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:34,93
 the air; that which is spiritual being in the

00:00:34,93 --> 00:00:36,244
 likeness of that which is temporal; and that which is

20
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:37,558
 temporal in the likeness of that which is

00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:38,872

 whom is given power over the four parts of the

 have the everlasting gospel to commit to every

29
00:00:48,07 --> 00:00:49,384

00:00:49,384 --> 00:00:50,698

 four angels having the everlasting gospel,

00:00:58,582 --> 00:00:59,896
 saying: Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the

38
00:00:59,896 --> 00:01:01,21
 trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in

39
00:01:01,21 --> 00:01:02,524
 their foreheads. And, if you will receive it,

40
00:01:02,524 --> 00:01:03,838
 this is Elias which was to come to gather together

41
00:01:03,838 --> 00:01:05,152

00:01:10,408 --> 00:01:11,722
 six days, and on the seventh day he finished his

47
00:01:11,722 --> 00:01:13,036
 work, and sanctified it, and also formed man out of

48
00:01:13,036 --> 00:01:14,35
 the dust of the earth, even so, in the beginning

49
00:01:14,35 --> 00:01:15,664
 of the seventh thousand years will the Lord God

50
00:01:15,664 --> 00:01:16,978
 sanctify the earth, and complete the salvation of

51
00:01:16,978 --> 00:01:18,292
 man, and judge all things, and shall redeem all

52
00:01:18,292 --> 00:01:19,606
 things, except that which he hath not put into his

53
00:01:19,606 --> 00:01:20,92
 power, when he shall have sealed all things, unto the

54
00:01:20,92 --> 00:01:22,234
 end of all things; and the sounding of the

55
00:01:22,234 --> 00:01:23,548

57
00:01:24,862 --> 00:01:26,176

 time of his coming.

00:01:32,746 --> 00:01:34,06
 gather the tribes of Israel; behold, this is Elias,

64
00:01:34,06 --> 00:01:35,374

75
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:43,505

 classes of beings in their destined order or sphere

79
00:04:03,647 --> 00:04:10,361
 of creation, in the enjoyment of their eternal

80
00:04:10,361 --> 00:04:17,075
 felicity

81
00:04:17,307 --> 00:04:23,307
4 Q. What are we to understand by the eyes and

82
00:04:23,307 --> 00:04:29,307
 wings, which the beasts had?A. Their eyes are a

00:04:29,307 --> 00:04:35,307

 understand that these elders whom John saw, were elders

89
00:05:04,572 --> 00:05:10,239
 who had been faithful in the work of the ministry

90
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:15,906
 and were dead; who belonged to the seven churches,

91
00:05:15,906 --> 00:05:21,573
 and were then in the paradise of God

92
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:28,214

 seals?A. We are to understand that it contains the

95
00:05:42,5 --> 00:05:49,643

96
00:05:49,643 --> 00:05:56,786
 the hidden things of his economy concerning this

97
00:05:56,786 --> 00:06:03,929
 earth during the seven thousand years of its

98
00:06:03,929 --> 00:06:11,072
 continuance, or its temporal existence

00:06:11,555 --> 00:06:19,355
7 Q. What are we to understand by the seven seals

100
00:06:19,355 --> 00:06:27,155

00:06:27,155 --> 00:06:34,955
 that the first seal contains the things of the

102
00:06:34,955 --> 00:06:42,755
 first thousand years, and the second also of the

103
00:06:42,755 --> 00:06:50,555

9 Q. What are we to understand by the angel

107
00:08:28,771 --> 00:09:05,771

 tribes of Israel—twelve thousand out of every

112
00:09:50,684 --> 00:09:57,411
 tribe?A. We are to understand that those who are sealed

113
00:09:57,411 --> 00:10:04,138
 are high priests, ordained unto the holy order of

114
00:10:04,138 --> 00:10:10,865
 God, to administer the everlasting gospel; for

115
00:10:10,865 --> 00:10:17,592
 they are they who are ordained out of every nation,

116
00:10:17,592 --> 00:10:24,319
 kindred, tongue, and people, by the angels to whom

00:10:24,319 --> 00:10:31,046
 is given power over the nations of the earth, to

118
00:10:31,046 --> 00:10:37,773
 bring as many as will come to the church of the

123
00:12:26,432 --> 00:12:40,432
 which are written in the

124
00:12:40,176 --> 00:13:01,676
14 Q. What are we to understand by the little book

125
00:13:01,676 --> 00:13:23,176
