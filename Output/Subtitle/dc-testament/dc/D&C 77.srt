Section 77 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Prophet, at Hiram, Ohio, about March 1832. Joseph

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Smith’s history states, “In connection with the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
translation of the Scriptures, I received the

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
following explanation of the 
Revelation of

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
St. John.”

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
eternal felicity; 
8–10, Various angels restore the

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0

beginning of the seventh thousand years;

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
prophets will be raised up to the Jewish nation.

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
4th chapter, and 6th verse of the Revelation?A. It

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
is the earth, in its sanctified, immortal, and

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
eternal state.
same verse?A. They are figurative

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
expressions, used by the Revelator, John, in

16
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
describing heaven, the paradise of God, the happiness

17
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of man, and of beasts, and of creeping things,

18
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and of the fowls of the air; that which is

19
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
spiritual being in the likeness of that which is

20
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
temporal; and that which is temporal in the likeness of

21
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
that which is spiritual; the spirit of man in the

22
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
likeness of his person, as also the spirit of the

23
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
beast, and every other creature which God has

24
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
created.
7th chapter and 1st verse of Revelation?A.

25
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
We are to understand that they are four angels

26
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
sent forth from God, to whom is given power over

27
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the four parts of the earth, to save life and to

28
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
destroy; these are they who have the everlasting

29
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
gospel to commit to every nation, kindred, tongue,

30
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and people; having power to shut up the heavens,

31
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
to seal up unto life, or to cast down to the

32
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
regions of darkness.
Revelation 7th chapter and 2nd

33
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
verse?A. We are to understand that the angel

34
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
ascending from the east is he to whom is given the

35
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
seal of the living God over the twelve tribes of

36
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Israel; wherefore, he crieth unto the four angels

37
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
having the everlasting gospel, saying: Hurt not

38
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we

39
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
have sealed the servants of our God in their

40
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
foreheads. And, if you will receive it, this is Elias

41
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
which was to come to gather together the tribes

42
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of Israel and restore all things.

in the sixth thousand years, or the opening of the

45
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
sixth seal.
8th chapter of Revelation?A. We are

46
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
to understand that as God made the world in six

47
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
days, and on the seventh day he finished his work,

48
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and sanctified it, and also formed man out of

49
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the dust of the earth, even so, in the beginning of

50
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the seventh thousand years will the Lord God

51
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
sanctify the earth, and complete the salvation of

52
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
man, and judge all things, and shall redeem all

53
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
things, except that which he hath not put into his

54
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
power, when he shall have sealed all things, unto

55
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the end of all things; and the sounding of the

56
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
trumpets of the seven angels are the preparing and

57
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
finishing of his work, in the beginning of the

58
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
seventh thousand years—the preparing of the way

59
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
before the time of his coming.
9th chapter of

60
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Revelation?A. They are to be accomplished after the

61
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
opening of the seventh seal, before the coming of

62
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Christ.
10th chapter of Revelation?A. We are to

63
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
understand that it was a mission, and an ordinance,

64
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
for him to gather the tribes of Israel; behold,

65
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
this is Elias, who, as it is written, must come

66
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and restore all things.

68
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
raised up to the Jewish nation in the last days, at

69
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the time of the restoration, and to prophesy to the

70
00:00:00,0 --> 01:42:51,
Jews after they are gathered and have built the city of Jerusalem in the land of their fathers. 

71
01:42:51,0 --> 02:10:55,
1 Q. What is the sea of glass spoken of by John, 

72
02:10:55,0 --> 02:10:55,0

73
02:10:55,0 --> 03:29:21,
the four beasts, spoken of in the 

74
03:29:21,0 --> 03:29:21,0
3 Q. Are the four beasts limited

75
03:29:21,0 --> 03:29:21,0
to individual beasts, or do they

76
03:29:21,0 --> 03:29:21,0
represent classes or orders?A.

77
03:29:21,0 --> 03:29:21,0
They are limited to four individual

78
03:29:21,0 --> 03:29:21,0
beasts, which were shown to

79
03:29:21,0 --> 03:29:21,0
John, to represent the glory of the

80
03:29:21,0 --> 03:29:21,0
classes of beings in their

81
03:29:21,0 --> 03:29:21,0
destined order or sphere of creation, in

82
03:29:21,0 --> 04:16:19,
the enjoyment of their eternal felicity.

83
04:16:19,0 --> 04:16:19,0
4 Q. What are we to

84
04:16:19,0 --> 04:16:19,0
understand by the eyes and wings,

85
04:16:19,0 --> 04:16:19,0
which the beasts had?A. Their

86
04:16:19,0 --> 04:16:19,0
eyes are a representation of

87
04:16:19,0 --> 04:16:19,0
light and knowledge, that is,

88
04:16:19,0 --> 04:16:19,0
they are full of knowledge; and

89
04:16:19,0 --> 04:16:19,0
their wings are a

90
04:16:19,0 --> 04:46:21,
representation of power, to move, to act, etc.

91
04:46:21,0 --> 04:46:21,0

elders, spoken of by John?A.

94
04:46:21,0 --> 04:46:21,0
We are to understand that

95
04:46:21,0 --> 04:46:21,0
these elders whom John saw,

96
04:46:21,0 --> 04:46:21,0
were elders who had been

97
04:46:21,0 --> 04:46:21,0
faithful in the work of the

98
04:46:21,0 --> 04:46:21,0
ministry and were dead; who

99
04:46:21,0 --> 04:46:21,0
belonged to the seven churches,

100
04:46:21,0 --> 05:20:20,
and were then in the paradise of God.

05:20:20,0 --> 05:20:20,0
6 Q. What are we to

102
05:20:20,0 --> 05:20:20,0

saw, which was sealed on

104
05:20:20,0 --> 05:20:20,0
the back with seven seals?A.

105
05:20:20,0 --> 05:20:20,0
We are to understand that

106
05:20:20,0 --> 05:20:20,0
it contains the revealed

107
05:20:20,0 --> 05:20:20,0
will, mysteries, and the works

108
05:20:20,0 --> 05:20:20,0
of God; the hidden things

109
05:20:20,0 --> 05:20:20,0
of his economy concerning

110
05:20:20,0 --> 05:20:20,0
this earth during the seven

111
05:20:20,0 --> 05:20:20,0
thousand years of its

112
05:20:20,0 --> 05:59:19,
continuance, or its temporal existence.

113
05:59:19,0 --> 05:59:19,0
7 Q. What are we to

114
05:59:19,0 --> 05:59:19,0
understand by the seven

115

seals with which it was

116
05:59:19,0 --> 05:59:19,0
sealed?A. We are to

117
05:59:19,0 --> 05:59:19,0
understand that the first seal

118
05:59:19,0 --> 05:59:19,0
contains the things of

119
05:59:19,0 --> 05:59:19,0
the first thousand years,

120
05:59:19,0 --> 05:59:19,0
and the second also of

05:59:19,0 --> 05:59:19,0
the second thousand

122
05:59:19,0 --> 06:10:57,
years, and so on until the seventh.

123
06:10:57,0 --> 06:10:57,0
8 Q. What are we to

124
06:10:57,0 --> 06:10:57,0
understand by the four

125
06:10:57,0 --> 06:49:56,

07:50:54,0 --> 07:50:54,0
10 Q. What

131
07:50:54,0 --> 07:50:54,0

09:03:49,0 --> 09:03:49,0
11 Q. What

134
09:03:49,0 --> 09:03:49,0
are we to

135

understand by

136
09:03:49,0 --> 09:03:49,0
sealing the one

137
09:03:49,0 --> 09:03:49,0
hundred and

138
09:03:49,0 --> 09:03:49,0
forty-four

139
09:03:49,0 --> 09:03:49,0

140
09:03:49,0 --> 09:03:49,0
all the

09:03:49,0 --> 09:03:49,0
tribes of

142
09:03:49,0 --> 09:03:49,0
Israel—twelve

09:03:49,0 --> 09:03:49,0
sealed are

149
09:03:49,0 --> 09:03:49,0
high priests,

150
09:03:49,0 --> 09:03:49,0
ordained unto

09:03:49,0 --> 09:03:49,0

09:03:49,0 --> 09:03:49,0
they are they

157
09:03:49,0 --> 09:03:49,0

tongue, and

162
09:03:49,0 --> 09:03:49,0
people, by the
