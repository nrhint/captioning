1
00:00:11,328 --> 00:00:19,152
Section 109 Prayer offered at the dedication of

2
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:26,976
 the temple at Kirtland, Ohio, March 27, 1836.

3
00:00:26,976 --> 00:00:34,8
 According to the Prophet’s written statement, this

4
00:00:34,8 --> 00:00:42,624
 prayer was given to him by revelation. 
1–5, The

5
00:00:42,624 --> 00:00:50,448
 Kirtland Temple was built as a place for the Son of Man

6
00:00:50,448 --> 00:00:58,272
 to visit; 
6–21, It is to be a house of prayer,

7
00:00:58,272 --> 00:01:06,096
 fasting, faith, learning, glory, and order, and a

8
00:01:06,096 --> 00:01:13,92
 house of God; 
22–33, May the unrepentant who oppose

9
00:01:13,92 --> 00:01:21,744
 the Lord’s people be confounded; 
34–42, May the

10
00:01:21,744 --> 00:01:29,568
 Saints go forth in power to gather the righteous

11
00:01:29,568 --> 00:01:37,392
 to Zion; 
43–53, May the Saints be delivered from

12
00:01:37,392 --> 00:01:45,216
 the terrible things to be poured out upon the

13
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:53,04
 wicked in the last days; 
54–58, May nations and

14
00:01:53,04 --> 00:02:00,864
 peoples and churches be prepared for the gospel; 
59–67,

15
00:02:00,864 --> 00:02:08,688
 May the Jews, the Lamanites, and all Israel be

16
00:02:08,688 --> 00:02:16,512
 redeemed; 
68–80, May the Saints be crowned with

17
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:24,336
 glory and honor and gain eternal salvation.

18
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:31,394
1 Thanks be to thy name, O Lord God of Israel, who

19
00:02:31,394 --> 00:02:38,144
 keepest covenant and showest mercy unto thy

20
00:02:38,144 --> 00:02:44,894
 servants who walk uprightly before thee, with all their

21
00:02:44,894 --> 00:02:51,644
 hearts

22
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:57,638
2 Thou who hast commanded thy servants to build a

23
00:02:57,638 --> 00:03:03,638
 house to thy name in this place [Kirtland]

24
00:03:03,633 --> 00:03:08,633
3 And now thou beholdest, O Lord, that thy

25
00:03:08,633 --> 00:03:13,633
 servants have done according to thy commandment

26
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:18,927
4 And now we ask thee, Holy Father, in the name of

27
00:03:18,927 --> 00:03:23,927
 Jesus Christ, the Son of thy bosom, in whose name

28
00:03:23,927 --> 00:03:28,927
 alone salvation can be administered to the

29
00:03:28,927 --> 00:03:33,927
 children of men, we ask thee, O Lord, to accept of this

30
00:03:33,927 --> 00:03:38,927
 house, the workmanship of the hands of us, thy

31
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:43,927
 servants, which thou didst command us to build

32
00:03:43,907 --> 00:03:49,707
5 For thou knowest that we have done this work

33
00:03:49,707 --> 00:03:55,507
 through great tribulation; and out of our poverty we

34
00:03:55,507 --> 00:04:01,307
 have given of our substance to build a house to

35
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:07,107
 thy name, that the Son of Man might have a place to

36
00:04:07,107 --> 00:04:12,907
 manifest himself to his people

37
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:18,185
6 And as thou hast said in a revelation, given to

38
00:04:18,185 --> 00:04:24,185
 us, calling us thy friends, saying—Call your

39
00:04:24,185 --> 00:04:30,185
 solemn assembly, as I have commanded you

40
00:04:30,47 --> 00:04:35,97
7 And as all have not faith, seek ye diligently

41
00:04:35,97 --> 00:04:41,47
 and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye

42
00:04:41,47 --> 00:04:46,97
 out of the best books words of wisdom, seek

43
00:04:46,97 --> 00:04:52,47
 learning even by study and also by faith

44
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:57,659
8 Organize yourselves; prepare every needful

45
00:04:57,659 --> 00:05:02,859
 thing, and establish a house, even a house of prayer, a

46
00:05:02,859 --> 00:05:08,059
 house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of

47
00:05:08,059 --> 00:05:13,259
 learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a

48
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:18,459
 house of God

49
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:23,085
9 That your incomings may be in the name of the

50
00:05:23,085 --> 00:05:27,685
 Lord, that your outgoings may be in the name of the

51
00:05:27,685 --> 00:05:32,285
 Lord, that all your salutations may be in the name

52
00:05:32,285 --> 00:05:36,885
 of the Lord, with uplifted hands unto the Most

53
00:05:36,885 --> 00:05:41,485
 High

54
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:47,491
10 And now, Holy Father, we ask thee to assist us,

55
00:05:47,491 --> 00:05:53,241
 thy people, with thy grace, in calling our solemn

56
00:05:53,241 --> 00:05:58,991
 assembly, that it may be done to thine honor and

57
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:04,741
 to thy divine acceptance

58
00:06:04,247 --> 00:06:10,747
11 And in a manner that we may be found worthy, in

59
00:06:10,747 --> 00:06:17,247
 thy sight, to secure a fulfilment of the promises

60
00:06:17,247 --> 00:06:23,747
 which thou hast made unto us, thy people, in the

61
00:06:23,747 --> 00:06:30,247
 revelations given unto us

62
00:06:30,24 --> 00:06:36,04
12 That thy glory may rest down upon thy people,

63
00:06:36,04 --> 00:06:41,84
 and upon this thy house, which we now dedicate to

64
00:06:41,84 --> 00:06:47,64
 thee, that it may be sanctified and consecrated to

65
00:06:47,64 --> 00:06:53,44
 be holy, and that thy holy presence may be

66
00:06:53,44 --> 00:06:59,24
 continually in this house

67
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:03,752
13 And that all people who shall enter upon the

68
00:07:03,752 --> 00:07:07,952
 threshold of the Lord’s house may feel thy power,

69
00:07:07,952 --> 00:07:12,152
 and feel constrained to acknowledge that thou hast

70
00:07:12,152 --> 00:07:16,352
 sanctified it, and that it is thy house, a place of

71
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:20,552
 thy holiness

72
00:07:20,824 --> 00:07:26,424
14 And do thou grant, Holy Father, that all those

73
00:07:26,424 --> 00:07:32,024
 who shall worship in this house may be taught

74
00:07:32,024 --> 00:07:37,624
 words of wisdom out of the best books, and that they

75
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:43,224
 may seek learning even by study, and also by faith,

76
00:07:43,224 --> 00:07:48,824
 as thou hast said

77
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:52,552
15 And that they may grow up in thee, and receive

78
00:07:52,552 --> 00:07:56,302
 a fulness of the Holy Ghost, and be organized

79
00:07:56,302 --> 00:08:00,052
 according to thy laws, and be prepared to obtain every

80
00:08:00,052 --> 00:08:03,802
 needful thing

81
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,983
16 And that this house may be a house of prayer, a

82
00:08:06,983 --> 00:08:10,65
 house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of

83
00:08:10,65 --> 00:08:14,317
 glory and of God, even thy house

84
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:20,328
17 That all the incomings of thy people, into this

85
00:08:20,328 --> 00:08:25,828
 house, may be in the name of the Lord

86
00:08:25,355 --> 00:08:29,855
18 That all their outgoings from this house may be

87
00:08:29,855 --> 00:08:34,355
 in the name of the Lord

88
00:08:34,397 --> 00:08:38,397
19 And that all their salutations may be in the

89
00:08:38,397 --> 00:08:42,397
 name of the Lord, with holy hands, uplifted to the

90
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:46,397
 Most High

91
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:49,393
20 And that no unclean thing shall be permitted to

92
00:08:49,393 --> 00:08:52,393
 come into thy house to pollute it

93
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:59,316
21 And when thy people transgress, any of them,

94
00:08:59,316 --> 00:09:05,716
 they may speedily repent and return unto thee, and

95
00:09:05,716 --> 00:09:12,116
 find favor in thy sight, and be restored to the

96
00:09:12,116 --> 00:09:18,516
 blessings which thou hast ordained to be poured out

97
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:24,916
 upon those who shall reverence thee in thy house

98
00:09:24,881 --> 00:09:29,681
22 And we ask thee, Holy Father, that thy servants

99
00:09:29,681 --> 00:09:34,481
 may go forth from this house armed with thy

100
00:09:34,481 --> 00:09:39,281
 power, and that thy name may be upon them, and thy

101
00:09:39,281 --> 00:09:44,081
 glory be round about them, and thine angels have

102
00:09:44,081 --> 00:09:48,881
 charge over them

103
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:54,221
23 And from this place they may bear exceedingly

104
00:09:54,221 --> 00:09:59,554
 great and glorious tidings, in truth, unto the ends

105
00:09:59,554 --> 00:10:04,887
 of the earth, that they may know that this is thy

106
00:10:04,887 --> 00:10:10,22
 work, and that thou hast put forth thy hand, to

107
00:10:10,22 --> 00:10:15,553
 fulfil that which thou hast spoken by the mouths of

108
00:10:15,553 --> 00:10:20,886
 the prophets, concerning the last days

109
00:10:20,37 --> 00:10:24,87
24 We ask thee, Holy Father, to establish the

110
00:10:24,87 --> 00:10:29,37
 people that shall worship, and honorably hold a name

111
00:10:29,37 --> 00:10:33,87
 and standing in this thy house, to all generations

112
00:10:33,87 --> 00:10:38,37
 and for eternity

113
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:46,905
25 That no weapon formed against them shall

114
00:10:46,905 --> 00:10:54,905
 prosper; that he who diggeth a pit for them shall fall

115
00:10:54,905 --> 00:11:02,905
 into the same himself

116
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:07,162
26 That no combination of wickedness shall have

117
00:11:07,162 --> 00:11:12,162
 power to rise up and prevail over thy people upon

118
00:11:12,162 --> 00:11:17,162
 whom thy name shall be put in this house

119
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:23,411
27 And if any people shall rise against this

120
00:11:23,411 --> 00:11:28,911
 people, that thine anger be kindled against them

121
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:35,922
28 And if they shall smite this people thou wilt

122
00:11:35,922 --> 00:11:42,922
 smite them; thou wilt fight for thy people as thou

123
00:11:42,922 --> 00:11:49,922
 didst in the day of battle, that they may be

124
00:11:49,922 --> 00:11:56,922
 delivered from the hands of all their enemies

125
00:11:56,9 --> 00:12:02,733
29 We ask thee, Holy Father, to confound, and

126
00:12:02,733 --> 00:12:08,566
 astonish, and to bring to shame and confusion, all

127
00:12:08,566 --> 00:12:14,399
 those who have spread lying reports abroad, over the

128
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:20,232
 world, against thy servant or servants, if they

129
00:12:20,232 --> 00:12:26,065
 will not repent, when the everlasting gospel shall

130
00:12:26,065 --> 00:12:31,898
 be proclaimed in their ears

131
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:36,217
30 And that all their works may be brought to

132
00:12:36,217 --> 00:12:41,017
 naught, and be swept away by the hail, and by the

133
00:12:41,017 --> 00:12:45,817
 judgments which thou wilt send upon them in thine

134
00:12:45,817 --> 00:12:50,617
 anger, that there may be an end to lyings and slanders

135
00:12:50,617 --> 00:12:55,417
 against thy people

136
00:12:55,725 --> 00:13:00,225
31 For thou knowest, O Lord, that thy servants

137
00:13:00,225 --> 00:13:04,725
 have been innocent before thee in bearing record of

138
00:13:04,725 --> 00:13:09,225
 thy name, for which they have suffered these

139
00:13:09,225 --> 00:13:13,725
 things

140
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:18,026
32 Therefore we plead before thee for a full and

141
00:13:18,026 --> 00:13:23,026
 complete deliverance from under this yoke

142
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:28,053
33 Break it off, O Lord; break it off from the

143
00:13:28,053 --> 00:13:32,553
 necks of thy servants, by thy power, that we may rise

144
00:13:32,553 --> 00:13:37,053
 up in the midst of this generation and do thy

145
00:13:37,053 --> 00:13:41,553
 work

146
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:48,887
34 O Jehovah, have mercy upon this people, and as

147
00:13:48,887 --> 00:13:56,22
 all men sin, forgive the transgressions of thy

148
00:13:56,22 --> 00:14:03,553
 people, and let them be blotted out forever

149
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:07,559
35 Let the anointing of thy ministers be sealed

150
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:12,059
 upon them with power from on high

151
00:14:12,835 --> 00:14:22,085
36 Let it be fulfilled upon them, as upon those on

152
00:14:22,085 --> 00:14:31,335
 the day of Pentecost; let the gift of tongues be

153
00:14:31,335 --> 00:14:40,585
 poured out upon thy people, even cloven tongues as

154
00:14:40,585 --> 00:14:49,835
 of fire, and the interpretation thereof

155
00:14:49,338 --> 00:14:54,838
37 And let thy house be filled, as with a rushing

156
00:14:54,838 --> 00:15:00,338
 mighty wind, with thy glory

157
00:15:00,349 --> 00:15:05,778
38 Put upon thy servants the testimony of the

158
00:15:05,778 --> 00:15:11,207
 covenant, that when they go out and proclaim thy word

159
00:15:11,207 --> 00:15:16,636
 they may seal up the law, and prepare the hearts

160
00:15:16,636 --> 00:15:22,065
 of thy saints for all those judgments thou art

161
00:15:22,065 --> 00:15:27,494
 about to send, in thy wrath, upon the inhabitants of

162
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:32,923
 the earth, because of their transgressions, that

163
00:15:32,923 --> 00:15:38,352
 thy people may not faint in the day of trouble

164
00:15:38,087 --> 00:15:43,373
39 And whatsoever city thy servants shall enter,

165
00:15:43,373 --> 00:15:48,659
 and the people of that city receive their

166
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:53,945
 testimony, let thy peace and thy salvation be upon that

167
00:15:53,945 --> 00:15:59,231
 city; that they may gather out of that city the

168
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:04,517
 righteous, that they may come forth to Zion, or to her

169
00:16:04,517 --> 00:16:09,803
 stakes, the places of thine appointment, with

170
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:15,089
 songs of everlasting joy

171
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:21,575
40 And until this be accomplished, let not thy

172
00:16:21,575 --> 00:16:27,575
 judgments fall upon that city

173
00:16:27,57 --> 00:16:34,57
41 And whatsoever city thy servants shall enter,

174
00:16:34,57 --> 00:16:41,57
 and the people of that city receive not the

175
00:16:41,57 --> 00:16:48,57
 testimony of thy servants, and thy servants warn them to

176
00:16:48,57 --> 00:16:55,57
 save themselves from this untoward generation, let

177
00:16:55,57 --> 00:17:02,57
 it be upon that city according to that which thou

178
00:17:02,57 --> 00:17:09,57
 hast spoken by the mouths of thy prophets

179
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:17,394
42 But deliver thou, O Jehovah, we beseech thee,

180
00:17:17,394 --> 00:17:25,727
 thy servants from their hands, and cleanse them

181
00:17:25,727 --> 00:17:34,06
 from their blood

182
00:17:34,57 --> 00:17:39,237
43 O Lord, we delight not in the destruction of

183
00:17:39,237 --> 00:17:43,904
 our fellow men; their souls are precious before

184
00:17:43,904 --> 00:17:48,571
 thee

185
00:17:48,084 --> 00:17:54,751
44 But thy word must be fulfilled. Help thy

186
00:17:54,751 --> 00:18:01,418
 servants to say, with thy grace assisting them: Thy will

187
00:18:01,418 --> 00:18:08,085
 be done, O Lord, and not ours

188
00:18:08,137 --> 00:18:15,387
45 We know that thou hast spoken by the mouth of

189
00:18:15,387 --> 00:18:22,637
 thy prophets terrible things concerning the wicked,

190
00:18:22,637 --> 00:18:29,887
 in the last days—that thou wilt pour out thy

191
00:18:29,887 --> 00:18:37,137
 judgments, without measure

192
00:18:37,4 --> 00:18:45,9
46 Therefore, O Lord, deliver thy people from the

193
00:18:45,9 --> 00:18:54,4
 calamity of the wicked; enable thy servants to

194
00:18:54,4 --> 00:19:02,9
 seal up the law, and bind up the testimony, that they

195
00:19:02,9 --> 00:19:11,4
 may be prepared against the day of burning

196
00:19:11,15 --> 00:19:18,35
47 We ask thee, Holy Father, to remember those who

197
00:19:18,35 --> 00:19:25,55
 have been driven by the inhabitants of Jackson

198
00:19:25,55 --> 00:19:32,75
 county, Missouri, from the lands of their

199
00:19:32,75 --> 00:19:39,95
 inheritance, and break off, O Lord, this yoke of affliction

200
00:19:39,95 --> 00:19:47,15
 that has been put upon them

201
00:19:47,903 --> 00:19:53,653
48 Thou knowest, O Lord, that they have been

202
00:19:53,653 --> 00:19:59,403
 greatly oppressed and afflicted by wicked men; and our

203
00:19:59,403 --> 00:20:05,153
 hearts flow out with sorrow because of their

204
00:20:05,153 --> 00:20:10,903
 grievous burdens

205
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:16,576
49 O Lord, how long wilt thou suffer this people

206
00:20:16,576 --> 00:20:22,976
 to bear this affliction, and the cries of their

207
00:20:22,976 --> 00:20:29,376
 innocent ones to ascend up in thine ears, and their

208
00:20:29,376 --> 00:20:35,776
 blood come up in testimony before thee, and not

209
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:42,176
 make a display of thy testimony in their behalf

210
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:49,942
50 Have mercy, O Lord, upon the wicked mob, who

211
00:20:49,942 --> 00:20:56,942
 have driven thy people, that they may cease to

212
00:20:56,942 --> 00:21:03,942
 spoil, that they may repent of their sins if repentance

213
00:21:03,942 --> 00:21:10,942
 is to be found

214
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:16,535
51 But if they will not, make bare thine arm, O

215
00:21:16,535 --> 00:21:22,868
 Lord, and redeem that which thou didst appoint a

216
00:21:22,868 --> 00:21:29,201
 Zion unto thy people

217
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:35,805
52 And if it cannot be otherwise, that the cause

218
00:21:35,805 --> 00:21:42,405
 of thy people may not fail before thee may thine

219
00:21:42,405 --> 00:21:49,005
 anger be kindled, and thine indignation fall upon

220
00:21:49,005 --> 00:21:55,605
 them, that they may be wasted away, both root and

221
00:21:55,605 --> 00:22:02,205
 branch, from under heaven

222
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:09,554
53 But inasmuch as they will repent, thou art

223
00:22:09,554 --> 00:22:16,887
 gracious and merciful, and wilt turn away thy wrath

224
00:22:16,887 --> 00:22:24,22
 when thou lookest upon the face of thine Anointed

225
00:22:24,727 --> 00:22:31,927
54 Have mercy, O Lord, upon all the nations of the

226
00:22:31,927 --> 00:22:39,127
 earth; have mercy upon the rulers of our land;

227
00:22:39,127 --> 00:22:46,327
 may those principles, which were so honorably and

228
00:22:46,327 --> 00:22:53,527
 nobly defended, namely, the Constitution of our

229
00:22:53,527 --> 00:23:00,727
 land, by our fathers, be established forever

230
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:06,962
55 Remember the kings, the princes, the nobles,

231
00:23:06,962 --> 00:23:13,462
 and the great ones of the earth, and all people, and

232
00:23:13,462 --> 00:23:19,962
 the churches, all the poor, the needy, and

233
00:23:19,962 --> 00:23:26,462
 afflicted ones of the earth

234
00:23:26,221 --> 00:23:32,821
56 That their hearts may be softened when thy

235
00:23:32,821 --> 00:23:39,421
 servants shall go out from thy house, O Jehovah, to

236
00:23:39,421 --> 00:23:46,021
 bear testimony of thy name; that their prejudices

237
00:23:46,021 --> 00:23:52,621
 may give way before the truth, and thy people may

238
00:23:52,621 --> 00:23:59,221
 obtain favor in the sight of all

239
00:23:59,221 --> 00:24:04,888
57 That all the ends of the earth may know that

240
00:24:04,888 --> 00:24:10,555
 we, thy servants, have heard thy voice, and that

241
00:24:10,555 --> 00:24:16,222
 thou hast sent us

242
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:22,989
58 That from among all these, thy servants, the

243
00:24:22,989 --> 00:24:28,989
 sons of Jacob, may gather out the righteous to build

244
00:24:28,989 --> 00:24:34,989
 a holy city to thy name, as thou hast commanded

245
00:24:34,989 --> 00:24:40,989
 them

246
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:46,245
59 We ask thee to appoint unto Zion other stakes

247
00:24:46,245 --> 00:24:52,245
 besides this one which thou hast appointed, that

248
00:24:52,245 --> 00:24:58,245
 the gathering of thy people may roll on in great

249
00:24:58,245 --> 00:25:04,245
 power and majesty, that thy work may be cut short in

250
00:25:04,245 --> 00:25:10,245
 righteousness

251
00:25:10,743 --> 00:25:14,993
60 Now these words, O Lord, we have spoken before

252
00:25:14,993 --> 00:25:19,243
 thee, concerning the revelations and commandments

253
00:25:19,243 --> 00:25:23,493
 which thou hast given unto us, who are identified

254
00:25:23,493 --> 00:25:27,743
 with the Gentiles

255
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:32,792
61 But thou knowest that thou hast a great love

256
00:25:32,792 --> 00:25:38,292
 for the children of Jacob, who have been scattered

257
00:25:38,292 --> 00:25:43,792
 upon the mountains for a long time, in a cloudy and

258
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:49,292
 dark day

259
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:54,647
62 We therefore ask thee to have mercy upon the

260
00:25:54,647 --> 00:25:59,98
 children of Jacob, that Jerusalem, from this hour,

261
00:25:59,98 --> 00:26:05,313
 may begin to be redeemed

262
00:26:05,347 --> 00:26:09,847
63 And the yoke of bondage may begin to be broken

263
00:26:09,847 --> 00:26:14,347
 off from the house of David

264
00:26:14,64 --> 00:26:19,307
64 And the children of Judah may begin to return

265
00:26:19,307 --> 00:26:23,974
 to the lands which thou didst give to Abraham,

266
00:26:23,974 --> 00:26:28,641
 their father

267
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:35,921
65 And cause that the remnants of Jacob, who have

268
00:26:35,921 --> 00:26:42,921
 been cursed and smitten because of their

269
00:26:42,921 --> 00:26:49,921
 transgression, be converted from their wild and savage

270
00:26:49,921 --> 00:26:56,921
 condition to the fulness of the everlasting gospel

271
00:26:56,181 --> 00:27:01,681
66 That they may lay down their weapons of

272
00:27:01,681 --> 00:27:07,181
 bloodshed, and cease their rebellions

273
00:27:07,96 --> 00:27:13,76
67 And may all the scattered remnants of Israel,

274
00:27:13,76 --> 00:27:19,56
 who have been driven to the ends of the earth, come

275
00:27:19,56 --> 00:27:25,36
 to a knowledge of the truth, believe in the

276
00:27:25,36 --> 00:27:31,16
 Messiah, and be redeemed from oppression, and rejoice

277
00:27:31,16 --> 00:27:36,96
 before thee

278
00:27:36,471 --> 00:27:42,804
68 O Lord, remember thy servant, Joseph Smith,

279
00:27:42,804 --> 00:27:49,137
 Jun., and all his afflictions and persecutions—how he

280
00:27:49,137 --> 00:27:55,47
 has covenanted with Jehovah, and vowed to thee, O

281
00:27:55,47 --> 00:28:01,803
 Mighty God of Jacob—and the commandments which

282
00:28:01,803 --> 00:28:08,136
 thou hast given unto him, and that he hath sincerely

283
00:28:08,136 --> 00:28:14,469
 striven to do thy will

284
00:28:14,96 --> 00:28:19,627
69 Have mercy, O Lord, upon his wife and children,

285
00:28:19,627 --> 00:28:24,294
 that they may be exalted in thy presence, and

286
00:28:24,294 --> 00:28:28,961
 preserved by thy fostering hand

287
00:28:28,04 --> 00:28:33,44
70 Have mercy upon all their immediate

288
00:28:33,44 --> 00:28:38,84
 connections, that their prejudices may be broken up and swept

289
00:28:38,84 --> 00:28:44,24
 away as with a flood; that they may be converted

290
00:28:44,24 --> 00:28:49,64
 and redeemed with Israel, and know that thou art

291
00:28:49,64 --> 00:28:55,04
 God

292
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:59,533
71 Remember, O Lord, the presidents, even all the

293
00:28:59,533 --> 00:29:04,033
 presidents of thy church, that thy right hand may

294
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:08,533
 exalt them, with all their families, and their

295
00:29:08,533 --> 00:29:13,033
 immediate connections, that their names may be

296
00:29:13,033 --> 00:29:17,533
 perpetuated and had in everlasting remembrance from

297
00:29:17,533 --> 00:29:22,033
 generation to generation

298
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:31,627
72 Remember all thy church, O Lord, with all their

299
00:29:31,627 --> 00:29:40,96
 families, and all their immediate connections,

300
00:29:40,96 --> 00:29:50,293
 with all their sick and afflicted ones, with all the

301
00:29:50,293 --> 00:29:59,626
 poor and meek of the earth; that the kingdom,

302
00:29:59,626 --> 00:30:08,959
 which thou hast set up without hands, may become a

303
00:30:08,959 --> 00:30:18,292
 great mountain and fill the whole earth

304
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:18,233
73 That thy church may come forth out of the

305
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:18,233
 wilderness of darkness, and shine forth fair as the

306
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:18,233
 moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with

307
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:18,233
 banners

308
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:23,767
74 And be adorned as a bride for that day when

309
00:30:23,767 --> 00:30:28,967
 thou shalt unveil the heavens, and cause the

310
00:30:28,967 --> 00:30:34,167
 mountains to flow down at thy presence, and the valleys to

311
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:39,367
 be exalted, the rough places made smooth; that

312
00:30:39,367 --> 00:30:44,567
 thy glory may fill the earth

313
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:48,593
75 That when the trump shall sound for the dead,

314
00:30:48,593 --> 00:30:52,593
 we shall be caught up in the cloud to meet thee,

315
00:30:52,593 --> 00:30:56,593
 that we may ever be with the Lord

316
00:30:56,355 --> 00:31:04,355
76 That our garments may be pure, that we may be

317
00:31:04,355 --> 00:31:12,355
 clothed upon with robes of righteousness, with

318
00:31:12,355 --> 00:31:20,355
 palms in our hands, and crowns of glory upon our

319
00:31:20,355 --> 00:31:28,355
 heads, and reap eternal joy for all our sufferings

320
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:34,586
77 O Lord God Almighty, hear us in these our

321
00:31:34,586 --> 00:31:41,086
 petitions, and answer us from heaven, thy holy

322
00:31:41,086 --> 00:31:47,586
 habitation, where thou sittest enthroned, with glory,

323
00:31:47,586 --> 00:31:54,086
 honor, power, majesty, might, dominion, truth,

324
00:31:54,086 --> 00:32:00,586
 justice, judgment, mercy, and an infinity of fulness,

325
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:07,086
 from everlasting to everlasting

326
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:14,059
78 O hear, O hear, O hear us, O Lord! And answer

327
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:20,559
 these petitions, and accept the dedication of this

328
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:27,059
 house unto thee, the work of our hands, which we

329
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:33,559
 have built unto thy name

330
00:32:33,168 --> 00:32:40,768
79 And also this church, to put upon it thy name.

331
00:32:40,768 --> 00:32:48,368
 And help us by the power of thy Spirit, that we

332
00:32:48,368 --> 00:32:55,968
 may mingle our voices with those bright, shining

333
00:32:55,968 --> 00:33:03,568
 seraphs around thy throne, with acclamations of

334
00:33:03,568 --> 00:33:11,168
 praise, singing Hosanna to God and the Lamb

335
00:33:11,423 --> 00:33:19,423
80 And let these, thine anointed ones, be clothed

336
00:33:19,423 --> 00:33:27,423
 with salvation, and thy saints shout aloud for

337
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:35,423
 joy. Amen, and Amen.
