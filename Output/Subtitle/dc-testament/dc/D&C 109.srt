1 Thanks be to thy name, O Lord God of

19
02:22:46,0 --> 02:22:46,0
Israel, who keepest covenant and

20
02:22:46,0 --> 02:22:46,0
showest mercy unto thy servants who walk

21
02:22:46,0 --> 02:18:26,
uprightly before thee, with all their hearts—

22
02:18:26,0 --> 02:18:26,0
2 Thou who hast commanded thy

23
02:18:26,0 --> 02:18:26,0
servants to build a house to thy

24
02:18:26,0 --> 02:23:31,
name in this place [Kirtland].

25
02:23:31,0 --> 02:23:31,0
3 And now thou beholdest, O

26
02:23:31,0 --> 02:23:31,0
Lord, that thy servants have

27
02:23:31,0 --> 02:51:07,
done according to thy commandment.

28
02:51:07,0 --> 02:51:07,0
4 And now we ask thee, Holy

29
02:51:07,0 --> 02:51:07,0
Father, in the name of Jesus

30
02:51:07,0 --> 02:51:07,0
Christ, the Son of thy bosom,

31
02:51:07,0 --> 02:51:07,0
in whose name alone salvation

32
02:51:07,0 --> 02:51:07,0
can be administered to the

33
02:51:07,0 --> 02:51:07,0
children of men, we ask thee,

34
02:51:07,0 --> 02:51:07,0
O Lord, to accept of this

35
02:51:07,0 --> 02:51:07,0
house, the workmanship of the

36
02:51:07,0 --> 02:51:07,0
hands of us, thy servants,

37
02:51:07,0 --> 03:02:45,
which thou didst command us to build.

38
03:02:45,0 --> 03:02:45,0
5 For thou knowest that we

39
03:02:45,0 --> 03:02:45,0
have done this work through

40
03:02:45,0 --> 03:02:45,0
great tribulation; and out of

41
03:02:45,0 --> 03:02:45,0
our poverty we have given

42
03:02:45,0 --> 03:02:45,0
of our substance to build a

43
03:02:45,0 --> 03:02:45,0
house to thy name, that the

44
03:02:45,0 --> 03:02:45,0
Son of Man might have a place

45
03:02:45,0 --> 03:13:18,
to manifest himself to his people.

46
03:13:18,0 --> 03:13:18,0
6 And as thou hast said in

47
03:13:18,0 --> 03:13:18,0
a revelation, given to us,

48
03:13:18,0 --> 03:13:18,0
calling us thy friends,

49
03:13:18,0 --> 03:13:18,0
saying—Call your solemn

50
03:13:18,0 --> 03:14:22,
assembly, as I have commanded you;

51
03:14:22,0 --> 03:14:22,0
7 And as all have not

52
03:14:22,0 --> 03:14:22,0
faith, seek ye diligently and

53
03:14:22,0 --> 03:14:22,0

54
03:14:22,0 --> 03:14:22,0
wisdom; yea, seek ye out

03:35:25,0 --> 03:35:25,0
9 That your incomings

68
03:35:25,0 --> 03:35:25,0
may be in the name of

69
03:35:25,0 --> 03:35:25,0
the Lord, that your

70
03:35:25,0 --> 03:35:25,0
outgoings may be in the

71
03:35:25,0 --> 03:35:25,0
name of the Lord, that

72
03:35:25,0 --> 03:35:25,0
all your salutations

73
03:35:25,0 --> 03:35:25,0
may be in the name of

74
03:35:25,0 --> 03:35:25,0
the Lord, with

03:35:25,0 --> 03:39:04,
uplifted hands unto the Most High—

76
03:39:04,0 --> 03:39:04,0
10 And now, Holy

77
03:39:04,0 --> 03:39:04,0
Father, we ask thee to

78
03:39:04,0 --> 03:39:04,0
assist us, thy people,

79
03:39:04,0 --> 03:39:04,0
with thy grace, in

80
03:39:04,0 --> 03:39:04,0
calling our solemn

81
03:39:04,0 --> 03:39:04,0
assembly, that it may be

82
03:39:04,0 --> 03:39:04,0
done to thine honor

83
03:39:04,0 --> 03:43:11,
and to thy divine acceptance;

84
03:43:11,0 --> 03:43:11,0
11 And in a manner

85
03:43:11,0 --> 03:43:11,0
that we may be

86
03:43:11,0 --> 03:43:11,0
found worthy, in thy

03:43:11,0 --> 03:43:11,0
sight, to secure a

88
03:43:11,0 --> 03:43:11,0

hast made unto us,

91
03:43:11,0 --> 03:43:11,0
thy people, in the

92
03:43:11,0 --> 04:11:15,

93
04:11:15,0 --> 04:11:15,0
12 That thy glory

94
04:11:15,0 --> 04:11:15,0

95
04:11:15,0 --> 04:11:15,0
thy people, and

04:11:15,0 --> 04:11:15,0
consecrated to be holy, and

102
04:11:15,0 --> 04:11:15,0
that thy holy

103
04:11:15,0 --> 04:11:15,0
presence may be

104
04:11:15,0 --> 04:26:17,

04:26:17,0 --> 04:26:17,0
13 And that all

106
04:26:17,0 --> 04:26:17,0

04:26:17,0 --> 04:26:17,0
that it is thy
