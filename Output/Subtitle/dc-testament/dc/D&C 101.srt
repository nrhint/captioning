1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 101 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, December 16 and 17,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
1833. At this time the Saints who had gathered in

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Missouri were suffering great persecution. Mobs

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
had driven them from their homes in Jackson

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
County; and some of the Saints had tried to establish

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
themselves in Van Buren, Lafayette, and Ray

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Counties, but persecution followed them. The main body

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of the Saints was at that time in Clay County,

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Missouri. Threats of death against individuals of

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Church were many. The Saints in Jackson County

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
had lost household furniture, clothing,

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
livestock, and other personal property; and many of their

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
crops had been destroyed. 
1–8, The Saints are

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
chastened and afflicted because of their

16
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
transgressions; 
9–15, The Lord’s indignation will fall

17
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
upon the nations, but His people will be gathered

18
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and comforted; 
16–21, Zion and her stakes will be

19
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
established; 
22–31, The nature of life during

20
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Millennium is set forth; 
32–42, The Saints

21
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
will be blessed and rewarded then; 
43–62, The

22
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
parable of the nobleman and the olive trees signifies

23
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the troubles and eventual redemption of Zion;

24
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
63–75, The Saints are to continue gathering

25
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
together; 
76–80, The Lord established the Constitution

26
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of the United States; 
81–101, The Saints are to

27
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
importune for the redress of grievances,

28
00:00:00,0 --> 03:47:11,
according to the parable of the woman and the unjust judge. 

29
03:47:11,0 --> 03:47:11,0
1 Verily I say unto you, concerning your

30
03:47:11,0 --> 03:47:11,0
brethren who have been afflicted, and persecuted,

31
03:47:11,0 --> 04:01:45,
and cast out from the land of their inheritance—

32
04:01:45,0 --> 04:01:45,0
2 I, the Lord, have suffered the affliction to

33
04:01:45,0 --> 04:01:45,0
come upon them, wherewith they have been

34
04:01:45,0 --> 04:16:46,
afflicted, in consequence of their transgressions;

35
04:16:46,0 --> 04:16:46,0
3 Yet I will own them, and they

36
04:16:46,0 --> 04:16:46,0
shall be mine in that day when I

37
04:16:46,0 --> 04:17:50,
shall come to make up my jewels.

38
04:17:50,0 --> 04:17:50,0
4 Therefore, they must needs

39
04:17:50,0 --> 04:17:50,0
be chastened and tried,

40
04:17:50,0 --> 04:17:50,0
even as Abraham, who was

41
04:17:50,0 --> 04:22:55,
commanded to offer up his only son.

42
04:22:55,0 --> 04:22:55,0
5 For all those who will

43
04:22:55,0 --> 04:22:55,0
not endure chastening, but

44
04:22:55,0 --> 04:29:58,
deny me, cannot be sanctified.

45
04:29:58,0 --> 04:29:58,0
6 Behold, I say unto

46
04:29:58,0 --> 04:29:58,0
you, there were jarrings,

47
04:29:58,0 --> 04:29:58,0
and contentions, and

48
04:29:58,0 --> 04:29:58,0
envyings, and strifes, and

49
04:29:58,0 --> 04:29:58,0
lustful and covetous

50
04:29:58,0 --> 04:29:58,0
desires among them;

51
04:29:58,0 --> 04:29:58,0
therefore by these things they

52
04:29:58,0 --> 04:41:36,
polluted their inheritances.

53
04:41:36,0 --> 04:41:36,0
7 They were slow to

54
04:41:36,0 --> 04:41:36,0
hearken unto the voice

55
04:41:36,0 --> 04:41:36,0
of the Lord their God;

56
04:41:36,0 --> 04:41:36,0
therefore, the Lord

57
04:41:36,0 --> 04:41:36,0
their God is slow to

58
04:41:36,0 --> 04:41:36,0
hearken unto their

59
04:41:36,0 --> 04:41:36,0
prayers, to answer them in

60
04:41:36,0 --> 04:53:42,
the day of their trouble.

61
04:53:42,0 --> 04:53:42,0
8 In the day of their

62
04:53:42,0 --> 04:53:42,0
peace they esteemed

63
04:53:42,0 --> 04:53:42,0
lightly my counsel;

64
04:53:42,0 --> 04:53:42,0
but, in the day of

65
04:53:42,0 --> 04:53:42,0
their trouble, of

66
04:53:42,0 --> 05:00:44,
necessity they feel after me.

67
05:00:44,0 --> 05:00:44,0
9 Verily I say unto

68
05:00:44,0 --> 05:00:44,0
you, notwithstanding

69
05:00:44,0 --> 05:00:44,0
their sins, my

70
05:00:44,0 --> 05:00:44,0
bowels are filled with

71
05:00:44,0 --> 05:00:44,0
compassion towards

72
05:00:44,0 --> 05:00:44,0
them. I will not

73
05:00:44,0 --> 05:00:44,0
utterly cast them off;

74
05:00:44,0 --> 05:00:44,0
and in the day of

75
05:00:44,0 --> 05:15:46,
wrath I will remember mercy.

76
05:15:46,0 --> 05:15:46,0
10 I have sworn,

77
05:15:46,0 --> 05:15:46,0
and the decree hath

78
05:15:46,0 --> 05:15:46,0
gone forth by a

79
05:15:46,0 --> 05:15:46,0
former commandment

80
05:15:46,0 --> 05:15:46,0
which I have given

81
05:15:46,0 --> 05:15:46,0
unto you, that I

82
05:15:46,0 --> 05:15:46,0
would let fall the

83
05:15:46,0 --> 05:15:46,0
sword of mine

84
05:15:46,0 --> 05:15:46,0
indignation in behalf

85
05:15:46,0 --> 05:15:46,0
of my people; and

86
05:15:46,0 --> 05:15:46,0
even as I have

87
05:15:46,0 --> 05:34:45,
said, it shall come to pass.

88
05:34:45,0 --> 05:34:45,0
11 Mine

89
05:34:45,0 --> 05:34:45,0
indignation is soon to be

90
05:34:45,0 --> 05:34:45,0
poured out

91
05:34:45,0 --> 05:34:45,0
without measure upon

92
05:34:45,0 --> 05:34:45,0
all nations; and

93
05:34:45,0 --> 05:34:45,0
this will I do when

94
05:34:45,0 --> 05:34:45,0
the cup of their

95
05:34:45,0 --> 05:37:47,
iniquity is full.

96
05:37:47,0 --> 05:37:47,0
12 And in that

97
05:37:47,0 --> 05:37:47,0
day all who are

98
05:37:47,0 --> 05:37:47,0
found upon the

99
05:37:47,0 --> 05:37:47,0
watch-tower,

100
05:37:47,0 --> 05:37:47,0
or in other

101
05:37:47,0 --> 05:37:47,0
words, all mine

102
05:37:47,0 --> 05:52:49,
Israel, shall be saved.

103
05:52:49,0 --> 05:52:49,0
13 And they

104
05:52:49,0 --> 05:52:49,0
that have been

105
05:52:49,0 --> 05:52:49,0
scattered

106
05:52:49,0 --> 06:11:49,
shall be gathered.

107
06:11:49,0 --> 06:11:49,0
14 And all

108
06:11:49,0 --> 06:11:49,0
they who have

109
06:11:49,0 --> 06:11:49,0
mourned shall

110
06:11:49,0 --> 06:18:52,
be comforted.

111
06:18:52,0 --> 06:18:52,0
15 And all

112
06:18:52,0 --> 06:18:52,0
they who have

113
06:18:52,0 --> 06:18:52,0
given their

114
06:18:52,0 --> 06:18:52,0
lives for

115
06:18:52,0 --> 06:18:52,0
my name shall

116
06:18:52,0 --> 06:33:53,
be crowned.

117
06:33:53,0 --> 06:33:53,0
16

118
06:33:53,0 --> 06:33:53,0
Therefore, let your

119
06:33:53,0 --> 06:33:53,0
hearts be

120
06:33:53,0 --> 06:33:53,0
comforted

121
06:33:53,0 --> 06:33:53,0
concerning

122
06:33:53,0 --> 06:33:53,0
Zion; for

123
06:33:53,0 --> 06:33:53,0
all flesh is

124
06:33:53,0 --> 06:33:53,0
in mine

125
06:33:53,0 --> 06:33:53,0
hands; be

126
06:33:53,0 --> 06:33:53,0
still and know

127
06:33:53,0 --> 06:45:30,
that I am God.

128
06:45:30,0 --> 06:45:30,0
17 Zion

129
06:45:30,0 --> 06:45:30,0
shall not be

130
06:45:30,0 --> 06:45:30,0
moved out of

131
06:45:30,0 --> 06:45:30,0
her place,

132
06:45:30,0 --> 06:45:30,0


133
06:45:30,0 --> 06:45:30,0
notwithstanding her

134
06:45:30,0 --> 06:45:30,0
children are

135
06:45:30,0 --> 06:44:34,
scattered.

136
06:44:34,0 --> 06:44:34,0
18 They

137
06:44:34,0 --> 06:44:34,0
that remain,

138
06:44:34,0 --> 06:44:34,0
and are

139
06:44:34,0 --> 06:44:34,0
pure in

140
06:44:34,0 --> 06:44:34,0
heart, shall

141
06:44:34,0 --> 06:44:34,0
return,

142
06:44:34,0 --> 06:44:34,0
and come to

143
06:44:34,0 --> 06:44:34,0
their

144
06:44:34,0 --> 06:44:34,0
inheritances,

145
06:44:34,0 --> 06:44:34,0
they and

146
06:44:34,0 --> 06:44:34,0
their

147
06:44:34,0 --> 06:44:34,0
children, with

148
06:44:34,0 --> 06:44:34,0
songs of

149
06:44:34,0 --> 06:44:34,0
everlasting

150
06:44:34,0 --> 06:44:34,0
joy, to

151
06:44:34,0 --> 06:44:34,0
build up

152
06:44:34,0 --> 06:46:38,
the waste places of Zion—

153
06:46:38,0 --> 06:46:38,0
19 And

154
06:46:38,0 --> 06:46:38,0
all these

155
06:46:38,0 --> 06:46:38,0
things

156
06:46:38,0 --> 06:46:38,0
that the

157
06:46:38,0 --> 06:46:38,0


158
06:46:38,0 --> 06:46:38,0
prophets might

159
06:46:38,0 --> 06:42:46,
be fulfilled.

160
06:42:46,0 --> 06:42:46,0
20 And,

161
06:42:46,0 --> 06:42:46,0


162
06:42:46,0 --> 06:42:46,0
behold, there

163
06:42:46,0 --> 06:42:46,0
is

164
06:42:46,0 --> 06:42:46,0
none other

165
06:42:46,0 --> 06:42:46,0

166
06:42:46,0 --> 06:42:46,0


167
06:42:46,0 --> 06:42:46,0
appointed than

168
06:42:46,0 --> 06:42:46,0
that

169
06:42:46,0 --> 06:42:46,0
which I

170
06:42:46,0 --> 06:42:46,0
have

171
06:42:46,0 --> 06:42:46,0


172
06:42:46,0 --> 06:42:46,0
appointed;

173
06:42:46,0 --> 06:42:46,0
neither

174
06:42:46,0 --> 06:42:46,0
shall there

175
06:42:46,0 --> 06:42:46,0
be any

176
06:42:46,0 --> 06:42:46,0
other

177
06:42:46,0 --> 06:42:46,0

178
06:42:46,0 --> 06:42:46,0


179
06:42:46,0 --> 06:42:46,0
appointed than

180
06:42:46,0 --> 06:42:46,0
that

181
06:42:46,0 --> 06:42:46,0
which I

182
06:42:46,0 --> 06:42:46,0
have

183
06:42:46,0 --> 06:42:46,0
appointed,

184
06:42:46,0 --> 06:42:46,0
for

185
06:42:46,0 --> 06:42:46,0
the work

186
06:42:46,0 --> 06:49:48,
of the gathering of my saints—

187
06:49:48,0 --> 06:49:48,0
21

188
06:49:48,0 --> 06:49:48,0
Until the

189
06:49:48,0 --> 06:49:48,0
day

190
06:49:48,0 --> 06:49:48,0
cometh

191
06:49:48,0 --> 06:49:48,0
when

192
06:49:48,0 --> 06:49:48,0
there

193
06:49:48,0 --> 06:49:48,0
is

194
06:49:48,0 --> 06:49:48,0
found no

195
06:49:48,0 --> 06:49:48,0

196
06:49:48,0 --> 06:49:48,0
room for

197
06:49:48,0 --> 06:49:48,0
them;

198
06:49:48,0 --> 06:49:48,0
and

199
06:49:48,0 --> 06:49:48,0
then I

200
06:49:48,0 --> 06:49:48,0
have

201
06:49:48,0 --> 06:49:48,0

203
06:49:48,0 --> 06:49:48,0
which

204
06:49:48,0 --> 06:49:48,0
I will

205
06:49:48,0 --> 06:49:48,0


206
06:49:48,0 --> 06:49:48,0

207
06:49:48,0 --> 06:49:48,0

208
06:49:48,0 --> 06:49:48,0
them, and

209
06:49:48,0 --> 06:49:48,0
they

210
06:49:48,0 --> 06:49:48,0
shall

211
06:49:48,0 --> 06:49:48,0
be

212
06:49:48,0 --> 06:49:48,0
called

213
06:49:48,0 --> 06:49:48,0
stakes,

214
06:49:48,0 --> 06:49:48,0
for the

215
06:49:48,0 --> 06:52:50,
curtains or the strength of Zion.

216
06:52:50,0 --> 06:52:50,0
22

217
06:52:50,0 --> 06:52:50,0
Behold,

218
06:52:50,0 --> 06:52:50,0
it

219
06:52:50,0 --> 06:52:50,0
is my

220
06:52:50,0 --> 06:52:50,0
will,

221
06:52:50,0 --> 06:52:50,0
