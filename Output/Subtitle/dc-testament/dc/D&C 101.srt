1
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:18,992
Section 101 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:18,992 --> 00:00:26,706
 Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, December 16 and 17,

3
00:00:26,706 --> 00:00:34,42
 1833. At this time the Saints who had gathered in

4
00:00:34,42 --> 00:00:42,134
 Missouri were suffering great persecution. Mobs had

5
00:00:42,134 --> 00:00:49,848
 driven them from their homes in Jackson County; and

6
00:00:49,848 --> 00:00:57,562
 some of the Saints had tried to establish

7
00:00:57,562 --> 00:01:05,276
 themselves in Van Buren, Lafayette, and Ray Counties, but

8
00:01:05,276 --> 00:01:12,99
 persecution followed them. The main body of the

9
00:01:12,99 --> 00:01:20,704
 Saints was at that time in Clay County, Missouri.

10
00:01:20,704 --> 00:01:28,418
 Threats of death against individuals of the Church

11
00:01:28,418 --> 00:01:36,132
 were many. The Saints in Jackson County had lost

12
00:01:36,132 --> 00:01:43,846
 household furniture, clothing, livestock, and other

13
00:01:43,846 --> 00:01:51,56
 personal property; and many of their crops had

14
00:01:51,56 --> 00:01:59,274
 been destroyed. 
1–8, The Saints are chastened and

15
00:01:59,274 --> 00:02:06,988
 afflicted because of their transgressions; 
9–15,

16
00:02:06,988 --> 00:02:14,702
 The Lord’s indignation will fall upon the nations,

17
00:02:14,702 --> 00:02:22,416
 but His people will be gathered and comforted;

18
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:30,13
16–21, Zion and her stakes will be established;

19
00:02:30,13 --> 00:02:37,844
22–31, The nature of life during the Millennium is

20
00:02:37,844 --> 00:02:45,558
 set forth; 
32–42, The Saints will be blessed and

21
00:02:45,558 --> 00:02:53,272
 rewarded then; 
43–62, The parable of the nobleman

22
00:02:53,272 --> 00:03:00,986
 and the olive trees signifies the troubles and

23
00:03:00,986 --> 00:03:08,7
 eventual redemption of Zion; 
63–75, The Saints are to

24
00:03:08,7 --> 00:03:16,414
 continue gathering together; 
76–80, The Lord

25
00:03:16,414 --> 00:03:24,128
 established the Constitution of the United States;

26
00:03:24,128 --> 00:03:31,842
81–101, The Saints are to importune for the redress

27
00:03:31,842 --> 00:03:39,556
 of grievances, according to the parable of the

28
00:03:39,556 --> 00:03:47,27
 woman and the unjust judge.

29
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:52,828
1 Verily I say unto you, concerning your brethren

30
00:03:52,828 --> 00:03:57,828
 who have been afflicted, and persecuted, and cast

31
00:03:57,828 --> 00:04:02,828
 out from the land of their inheritance

32
00:04:02,592 --> 00:04:05,925
2 I, the Lord, have suffered the affliction to

33
00:04:05,925 --> 00:04:09,258
 come upon them, wherewith they have been afflicted,

34
00:04:09,258 --> 00:04:12,591
 in consequence of their transgressions

35
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:21,886
3 Yet I will own them, and they shall be mine in

36
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:30,886
 that day when I shall come to make up my jewels

37
00:04:30,887 --> 00:04:35,22
4 Therefore, they must needs be chastened and

38
00:04:35,22 --> 00:04:39,553
 tried, even as Abraham, who was commanded to offer up

39
00:04:39,553 --> 00:04:43,886
 his only son

40
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:48,683
5 For all those who will not endure chastening,

41
00:04:48,683 --> 00:04:54,183
 but deny me, cannot be sanctified

42
00:04:54,461 --> 00:05:00,211
6 Behold, I say unto you, there were jarrings, and

43
00:05:00,211 --> 00:05:05,961
 contentions, and envyings, and strifes, and

44
00:05:05,961 --> 00:05:11,711
 lustful and covetous desires among them; therefore by

45
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:17,461
 these things they polluted their inheritances

46
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:22,217
7 They were slow to hearken unto the voice of the

47
00:05:22,217 --> 00:05:26,717
 Lord their God; therefore, the Lord their God is

48
00:05:26,717 --> 00:05:31,217
 slow to hearken unto their prayers, to answer them

49
00:05:31,217 --> 00:05:35,717
 in the day of their trouble

50
00:05:35,719 --> 00:05:42,052
8 In the day of their peace they esteemed lightly

51
00:05:42,052 --> 00:05:48,385
 my counsel; but, in the day of their trouble, of

52
00:05:48,385 --> 00:05:54,718
 necessity they feel after me

53
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:59,488
9 Verily I say unto you, notwithstanding their

54
00:05:59,488 --> 00:06:03,988
 sins, my bowels are filled with compassion towards

55
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:08,488
 them. I will not utterly cast them off; and in the

56
00:06:08,488 --> 00:06:12,988
 day of wrath I will remember mercy

57
00:06:12,989 --> 00:06:17,589
10 I have sworn, and the decree hath gone forth by

58
00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:22,189
 a former commandment which I have given unto you,

59
00:06:22,189 --> 00:06:26,789
 that I would let fall the sword of mine

60
00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:31,389
 indignation in behalf of my people; and even as I have

61
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:35,989
 said, it shall come to pass

62
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:40,495
11 Mine indignation is soon to be poured out

63
00:06:40,495 --> 00:06:45,495
 without measure upon all nations; and this will I do

64
00:06:45,495 --> 00:06:50,495
 when the cup of their iniquity is full

65
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:57,661
12 And in that day all who are found upon the

66
00:06:57,661 --> 00:07:04,328
 watch-tower, or in other words, all mine Israel, shall

67
00:07:04,328 --> 00:07:10,995
 be saved

68
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,763
13 And they that have been scattered shall be

69
00:07:12,763 --> 00:07:15,263
 gathered

70
00:07:15,785 --> 00:07:19,285
14 And all they who have mourned shall be

71
00:07:19,285 --> 00:07:22,785
 comforted

72
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:28,059
15 And all they who have given their lives for my

73
00:07:28,059 --> 00:07:33,559
 name shall be crowned

74
00:07:33,57 --> 00:07:39,903
16 Therefore, let your hearts be comforted

75
00:07:39,903 --> 00:07:46,236
 concerning Zion; for all flesh is in mine hands; be still

76
00:07:46,236 --> 00:07:52,569
 and know that I am God

77
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:57,839
17 Zion shall not be moved out of her place,

78
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:03,339
 notwithstanding her children are scattered

79
00:08:03,35 --> 00:08:09,6
18 They that remain, and are pure in heart, shall

80
00:08:09,6 --> 00:08:15,85
 return, and come to their inheritances, they and

81
00:08:15,85 --> 00:08:22,1
 their children, with songs of everlasting joy, to

82
00:08:22,1 --> 00:08:28,35
 build up the waste places of Zion

83
00:08:28,858 --> 00:08:33,358
19 And all these things that the prophets might be

84
00:08:33,358 --> 00:08:37,858
 fulfilled

85
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:41,484
20 And, behold, there is none other place

86
00:08:41,484 --> 00:08:45,084
 appointed than that which I have appointed; neither shall

87
00:08:45,084 --> 00:08:48,684
 there be any other place appointed than that which

88
00:08:48,684 --> 00:08:52,284
 I have appointed, for the work of the gathering

89
00:08:52,284 --> 00:08:55,884
 of my saints

90
00:08:55,885 --> 00:09:01,485
21 Until the day cometh when there is found no

91
00:09:01,485 --> 00:09:07,085
 more room for them; and then I have other places

92
00:09:07,085 --> 00:09:12,685
 which I will appoint unto them, and they shall be

93
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:18,285
 called stakes, for the curtains or the strength of

94
00:09:18,285 --> 00:09:23,885
 Zion

95
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:29,613
22 Behold, it is my will, that all they who call

96
00:09:29,613 --> 00:09:35,363
 on my name, and worship me according to mine

97
00:09:35,363 --> 00:09:41,113
 everlasting gospel, should gather together, and stand in

98
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:46,863
 holy places

99
00:09:46,87 --> 00:09:52,62
23 And prepare for the revelation which is to

100
00:09:52,62 --> 00:09:58,37
 come, when the veil of the covering of my temple, in

101
00:09:58,37 --> 00:10:04,12
 my tabernacle, which hideth the earth, shall be

102
00:10:04,12 --> 00:10:09,87
 taken off, and all flesh shall see me together

103
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:13,375
24 And every corruptible thing, both of man, or of

104
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:17,375
 the beasts of the field, or of the fowls of the

105
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:21,375
 heavens, or of the fish of the sea, that dwells

106
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:25,375
 upon all the face of the earth, shall be consumed

107
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:32,708
25 And also that of element shall melt with

108
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:39,708
 fervent heat; and all things shall become new, that my

109
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:46,708
 knowledge and glory may dwell upon all the earth

110
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:56,896
26 And in that day the enmity of man, and the

111
00:10:56,896 --> 00:11:07,563
 enmity of beasts, yea, the enmity of all flesh, shall

112
00:11:07,563 --> 00:11:18,23
 cease from before my face

113
00:11:18,194 --> 00:11:30,194
27 And in that day whatsoever any man shall ask,

114
00:11:30,194 --> 00:11:42,194
 it shall be given unto him

115
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:46,168
28 And in that day Satan shall not have power to

116
00:11:46,168 --> 00:11:50,168
 tempt any man

117
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:54,159
29 And there shall be no sorrow because there is

118
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:58,159
 no death

119
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:02,151
30 In that day an infant shall not die until he is

120
00:12:02,151 --> 00:12:06,151
 old; and his life shall be as the age of a tree

121
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:06,142
31 And when he dies he shall not sleep, that is to

122
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:06,142
 say in the earth, but shall be changed in the

123
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:06,142
 twinkling of an eye, and shall be caught up, and his

124
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:06,142
 rest shall be glorious

125
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,476
32 Yea, verily I say unto you, in that day when

126
00:12:08,476 --> 00:12:10,476
 the Lord shall come, he shall reveal all things

127
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:14,93
33 Things which have passed, and hidden things

128
00:12:14,93 --> 00:12:19,597
 which no man knew, things of the earth, by which it

129
00:12:19,597 --> 00:12:24,264
 was made, and the purpose and the end thereof

130
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:29,944
34 Things most precious, things that are above,

131
00:12:29,944 --> 00:12:35,611
 and things that are beneath, things that are in the

132
00:12:35,611 --> 00:12:41,278
 earth, and upon the earth, and in heaven

133
00:12:41,06 --> 00:12:47,06
35 And all they who suffer persecution for my

134
00:12:47,06 --> 00:12:53,06
 name, and endure in faith, though they are called to

135
00:12:53,06 --> 00:12:59,06
 lay down their lives for my sake yet shall they

136
00:12:59,06 --> 00:13:05,06
 partake of all this glory

137
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,701
36 Wherefore, fear not even unto death; for in

138
00:13:07,701 --> 00:13:10,368
 this world your joy is not full, but in me your joy

139
00:13:10,368 --> 00:13:13,035
 is full

140
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:22,359
37 Therefore, care not for the body, neither the

141
00:13:22,359 --> 00:13:31,692
 life of the body; but care for the soul, and for

142
00:13:31,692 --> 00:13:41,025
 the life of the soul

143
00:13:41,004 --> 00:13:46,004
38 And seek the face of the Lord always, that in

144
00:13:46,004 --> 00:13:51,004
 patience ye may possess your souls, and ye shall

145
00:13:51,004 --> 00:13:56,004
 have eternal life

146
00:13:56,986 --> 00:14:02,486
39 When men are called unto mine everlasting

147
00:14:02,486 --> 00:14:07,986
 gospel, and covenant with an everlasting covenant, they

148
00:14:07,986 --> 00:14:13,486
 are accounted as the salt of the earth and the

149
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:18,986
 savor of men

150
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:24,507
40 They are called to be the savor of men;

151
00:14:24,507 --> 00:14:30,757
 therefore, if that salt of the earth lose its savor,

152
00:14:30,757 --> 00:14:37,007
 behold, it is thenceforth good for nothing only to be

153
00:14:37,007 --> 00:14:43,257
 cast out and trodden under the feet of men

154
00:14:43,766 --> 00:14:48,016
41 Behold, here is wisdom concerning the children

155
00:14:48,016 --> 00:14:52,266
 of Zion, even many, but not all; they were found

156
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:56,516
 transgressors, therefore they must needs be

157
00:14:56,516 --> 00:15:00,766
 chastened

158
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:05,799
42 He that exalteth himself shall be abased, and

159
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:11,299
 he that abaseth himself shall be exalted

160
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:16,495
43 And now, I will show unto you a parable, that

161
00:15:16,495 --> 00:15:21,162
 you may know my will concerning the redemption of

162
00:15:21,162 --> 00:15:25,829
 Zion

163
00:15:25,108 --> 00:15:31,108
44 A certain nobleman had a spot of land, very

164
00:15:31,108 --> 00:15:37,108
 choice; and he said unto his servants: Go ye unto my

165
00:15:37,108 --> 00:15:43,108
 vineyard, even upon this very choice piece of

166
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:49,108
 land, and plant twelve olive trees

167
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:55,215
45 And set watchmen round about them, and build a

168
00:15:55,215 --> 00:16:00,548
 tower, that one may overlook the land round about,

169
00:16:00,548 --> 00:16:05,881
 to be a watchman upon the tower, that mine olive

170
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:11,214
 trees may not be broken down when the enemy shall

171
00:16:11,214 --> 00:16:16,547
 come to spoil and take upon themselves the fruit

172
00:16:16,547 --> 00:16:21,88
 of my vineyard

173
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:27,614
46 Now, the servants of the nobleman went and did

174
00:16:27,614 --> 00:16:33,614
 as their lord commanded them, and planted the

175
00:16:33,614 --> 00:16:39,614
 olive trees, and built a hedge round about, and set

176
00:16:39,614 --> 00:16:45,614
 watchmen, and began to build a tower

177
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:49,104
47 And while they were yet laying the foundation

178
00:16:49,104 --> 00:16:53,104
 thereof, they began to say among themselves: And

179
00:16:53,104 --> 00:16:57,104
 what need hath my lord of this tower

180
00:16:57,633 --> 00:17:01,633
48 And consulted for a long time, saying among

181
00:17:01,633 --> 00:17:05,633
 themselves: What need hath my lord of this tower,

182
00:17:05,633 --> 00:17:09,633
 seeing this is a time of peace

183
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:15,195
49 Might not this money be given to the

184
00:17:15,195 --> 00:17:20,695
 exchangers? For there is no need of these things

185
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:23,473
50 And while they were at variance one with

186
00:17:23,473 --> 00:17:26,473
 another they became very slothful, and they hearkened

187
00:17:26,473 --> 00:17:29,473
 not unto the commandments of their lord

188
00:17:29,999 --> 00:17:35,749
51 And the enemy came by night, and broke down the

189
00:17:35,749 --> 00:17:41,499
 hedge; and the servants of the nobleman arose and

190
00:17:41,499 --> 00:17:47,249
 were affrighted, and fled; and the enemy

191
00:17:47,249 --> 00:17:52,999
 destroyed their works, and broke down the olive trees

192
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:59,337
52 Now, behold, the nobleman, the lord of the

193
00:17:59,337 --> 00:18:06,67
 vineyard, called upon his servants, and said unto

194
00:18:06,67 --> 00:18:14,003
 them, Why! what is the cause of this great evil

195
00:18:14,277 --> 00:18:19,563
53 Ought ye not to have done even as I commanded

196
00:18:19,563 --> 00:18:24,849
 you, and—after ye had planted the vineyard, and

197
00:18:24,849 --> 00:18:30,135
 built the hedge round about, and set watchmen upon

198
00:18:30,135 --> 00:18:35,421
 the walls thereof—built the tower also, and set a

199
00:18:35,421 --> 00:18:40,707
 watchman upon the tower, and watched for my

200
00:18:40,707 --> 00:18:45,993
 vineyard, and not have fallen asleep, lest the enemy

201
00:18:45,993 --> 00:18:51,279
 should come upon you

202
00:18:51,53 --> 00:18:56,33
54 And behold, the watchman upon the tower would

203
00:18:56,33 --> 00:19:01,13
 have seen the enemy while he was yet afar off; and

204
00:19:01,13 --> 00:19:05,93
 then ye could have made ready and kept the enemy

205
00:19:05,93 --> 00:19:10,73
 from breaking down the hedge thereof, and saved my

206
00:19:10,73 --> 00:19:15,53
 vineyard from the hands of the destroyer

207
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:21,535
55 And the lord of the vineyard said unto one of

208
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:27,249
 his servants: Go and gather together the residue of

209
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:32,963
 my servants, and take all the strength of mine

210
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:38,677
 house, which are my warriors, my young men, and they

211
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:44,391
 that are of middle age also among all my

212
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:50,105
 servants, who are the strength of mine house, save those

213
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:55,819
 only whom I have appointed to tarry

214
00:19:55,294 --> 00:20:00,627
56 And go ye straightway unto the land of my

215
00:20:00,627 --> 00:20:05,96
 vineyard, and redeem my vineyard; for it is mine; I

216
00:20:05,96 --> 00:20:11,293
 have bought it with money

217
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:17,61
57 Therefore, get ye straightway unto my land;

218
00:20:17,61 --> 00:20:23,943
 break down the walls of mine enemies; throw down

219
00:20:23,943 --> 00:20:30,276
 their tower, and scatter their watchmen

220
00:20:30,546 --> 00:20:35,046
58 And inasmuch as they gather together against

221
00:20:35,046 --> 00:20:39,546
 you, avenge me of mine enemies, that by and by I may

222
00:20:39,546 --> 00:20:44,046
 come with the residue of mine house and possess

223
00:20:44,046 --> 00:20:48,546
 the land

224
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:53,047
59 And the servant said unto his lord: When shall

225
00:20:53,047 --> 00:20:57,547
 these things be

226
00:20:57,573 --> 00:21:01,24
60 And he said unto his servant: When I will; go

227
00:21:01,24 --> 00:21:04,907
 ye straightway, and do all things whatsoever I have

228
00:21:04,907 --> 00:21:08,574
 commanded you

229
00:21:08,1 --> 00:21:13,433
61 And this shall be my seal and blessing upon

230
00:21:13,433 --> 00:21:18,766
 you—a faithful and wise steward in the midst of mine

231
00:21:18,766 --> 00:21:24,099
 house, a ruler in my kingdom

232
00:21:24,65 --> 00:21:29,65
62 And his servant went straightway, and did all

233
00:21:29,65 --> 00:21:34,65
 things whatsoever his lord commanded him; and after

234
00:21:34,65 --> 00:21:39,65
 many days all things were fulfilled

235
00:21:39,915 --> 00:21:44,915
63 Again, verily I say unto you, I will show unto

236
00:21:44,915 --> 00:21:49,915
 you wisdom in me concerning all the churches,

237
00:21:49,915 --> 00:21:54,915
 inasmuch as they are willing to be guided in a right

238
00:21:54,915 --> 00:21:59,915
 and proper way for their salvation

239
00:21:59,668 --> 00:22:05,918
64 That the work of the gathering together of my

240
00:22:05,918 --> 00:22:12,168
 saints may continue, that I may build them up unto

241
00:22:12,168 --> 00:22:18,418
 my name upon holy places; for the time of harvest

242
00:22:18,418 --> 00:22:24,668
 is come, and my word must needs be fulfilled

243
00:22:24,944 --> 00:22:30,373
65 Therefore, I must gather together my people,

244
00:22:30,373 --> 00:22:35,802
 according to the parable of the wheat and the tares,

245
00:22:35,802 --> 00:22:41,231
 that the wheat may be secured in the garners to

246
00:22:41,231 --> 00:22:46,66
 possess eternal life, and be crowned with celestial

247
00:22:46,66 --> 00:22:52,089
 glory, when I shall come in the kingdom of my

248
00:22:52,089 --> 00:22:57,518
 Father to reward every man according as his work

249
00:22:57,518 --> 00:23:02,947
 shall be

250
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:09,014
66 While the tares shall be bound in bundles, and

251
00:23:09,014 --> 00:23:15,347
 their bands made strong, that they may be burned

252
00:23:15,347 --> 00:23:21,68
 with unquenchable fire

253
00:23:21,7 --> 00:23:27,367
67 Therefore, a commandment I give unto all the

254
00:23:27,367 --> 00:23:33,034
 churches, that they shall continue to gather

255
00:23:33,034 --> 00:23:38,701
 together unto the places which I have appointed

256
00:23:38,017 --> 00:23:42,267
68 Nevertheless, as I have said unto you in a

257
00:23:42,267 --> 00:23:46,517
 former commandment, let not your gathering be in

258
00:23:46,517 --> 00:23:50,767
 haste, nor by flight; but let all things be prepared

259
00:23:50,767 --> 00:23:55,017
 before you

260
00:23:55,784 --> 00:23:59,451
69 And in order that all things be prepared before

261
00:23:59,451 --> 00:24:03,118
 you, observe the commandment which I have given

262
00:24:03,118 --> 00:24:06,785
 concerning these things

263
00:24:06,095 --> 00:24:11,695
70 Which saith, or teacheth, to purchase all the

264
00:24:11,695 --> 00:24:17,295
 lands with money, which can be purchased for money,

265
00:24:17,295 --> 00:24:22,895
 in the region round about the land which I have

266
00:24:22,895 --> 00:24:28,495
 appointed to be the land of Zion, for the beginning

267
00:24:28,495 --> 00:24:34,095
 of the gathering of my saints

268
00:24:34,073 --> 00:24:39,406
71 All the land which can be purchased in Jackson

269
00:24:39,406 --> 00:24:44,739
 county, and the counties round about, and leave

270
00:24:44,739 --> 00:24:50,072
 the residue in mine hand

271
00:24:50,372 --> 00:24:56,622
72 Now, verily I say unto you, let all the

272
00:24:56,622 --> 00:25:02,872
 churches gather together all their moneys; let these

273
00:25:02,872 --> 00:25:09,122
 things be done in their time, but not in haste; and

274
00:25:09,122 --> 00:25:15,372
 observe to have all things prepared before you

275
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:22,647
73 And let honorable men be appointed, even wise

276
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:29,647
 men, and send them to purchase these lands

277
00:25:29,411 --> 00:25:35,911
74 And the churches in the eastern countries, when

278
00:25:35,911 --> 00:25:42,411
 they are built up, if they will hearken unto this

279
00:25:42,411 --> 00:25:48,911
 counsel they may buy lands and gather together

280
00:25:48,911 --> 00:25:55,411
 upon them; and in this way they may establish Zion

281
00:25:55,971 --> 00:26:02,371
75 There is even now already in store sufficient,

282
00:26:02,371 --> 00:26:08,771
 yea, even an abundance, to redeem Zion, and

283
00:26:08,771 --> 00:26:15,171
 establish her waste places, no more to be thrown down,

284
00:26:15,171 --> 00:26:21,571
 were the churches, who call themselves after my

285
00:26:21,571 --> 00:26:27,971
 name, willing to hearken to my voice

286
00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:33,253
76 And again I say unto you, those who have been

287
00:26:33,253 --> 00:26:39,053
 scattered by their enemies, it is my will that they

288
00:26:39,053 --> 00:26:44,853
 should continue to importune for redress, and

289
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:50,653
 redemption, by the hands of those who are placed as

290
00:26:50,653 --> 00:26:56,453
 rulers and are in authority over you

291
00:26:56,715 --> 00:27:00,515
77 According to the laws and constitution of the

292
00:27:00,515 --> 00:27:04,315
 people, which I have suffered to be established,

293
00:27:04,315 --> 00:27:08,115
 and should be maintained for the rights and

294
00:27:08,115 --> 00:27:11,915
 protection of all flesh, according to just and holy

295
00:27:11,915 --> 00:27:15,715
 principles

296
00:27:15,484 --> 00:27:20,484
78 That every man may act in doctrine and

297
00:27:20,484 --> 00:27:25,484
 principle pertaining to futurity, according to the moral

298
00:27:25,484 --> 00:27:30,484
 agency which I have given unto him, that every man

299
00:27:30,484 --> 00:27:35,484
 may be accountable for his own sins in the day of

300
00:27:35,484 --> 00:27:40,484
 judgment

301
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:44,492
79 Therefore, it is not right that any man should

302
00:27:44,492 --> 00:27:48,492
 be in bondage one to another

303
00:27:48,8 --> 00:27:55,3
80 And for this purpose have I established the

304
00:27:55,3 --> 00:28:01,8
 Constitution of this land, by the hands of wise men

305
00:28:01,8 --> 00:28:08,3
 whom I raised up unto this very purpose, and

306
00:28:08,3 --> 00:28:14,8
 redeemed the land by the shedding of blood

307
00:28:14,076 --> 00:28:20,326
81 Now, unto what shall I liken the children of

308
00:28:20,326 --> 00:28:26,576
 Zion? I will liken them unto the parable of the

309
00:28:26,576 --> 00:28:32,826
 woman and the unjust judge, for men ought always to

310
00:28:32,826 --> 00:28:39,076
 pray and not to faint, which saith

311
00:28:39,835 --> 00:28:44,335
82 There was in a city a judge which feared not

312
00:28:44,335 --> 00:28:48,835
 God, neither regarded man

313
00:28:48,86 --> 00:28:55,86
83 And there was a widow in that city, and she

314
00:28:55,86 --> 00:29:02,86
 came unto him, saying: Avenge me of mine adversary

315
00:29:02,624 --> 00:29:08,024
84 And he would not for a while, but afterward he

316
00:29:08,024 --> 00:29:13,424
 said within himself: Though I fear not God, nor

317
00:29:13,424 --> 00:29:18,824
 regard man, yet because this widow troubleth me I

318
00:29:18,824 --> 00:29:24,224
 will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she

319
00:29:24,224 --> 00:29:29,624
 weary me

320
00:29:29,384 --> 00:29:34,384
85 Thus will I liken the children of Zion

321
00:29:34,923 --> 00:29:40,923
86 Let them importune at the feet of the judge

322
00:29:40,929 --> 00:29:45,929
87 And if he heed them not, let them importune at

323
00:29:45,929 --> 00:29:50,929
 the feet of the governor

324
00:29:50,973 --> 00:29:55,973
88 And if the governor heed them not, let them

325
00:29:55,973 --> 00:30:00,973
 importune at the feet of the president

326
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:05,666
89 And if the president heed them not, then will

327
00:30:05,666 --> 00:30:10,333
 the Lord arise and come forth out of his hiding

328
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:15,0
 place, and in his fury vex the nation

329
00:30:14,997 --> 00:30:21,247
90 And in his hot displeasure, and in his fierce

330
00:30:21,247 --> 00:30:27,497
 anger, in his time, will cut off those wicked,

331
00:30:27,497 --> 00:30:33,747
 unfaithful, and unjust stewards, and appoint them

332
00:30:33,747 --> 00:30:39,997
 their portion among hypocrites, and unbelievers

333
00:30:39,287 --> 00:30:43,787
91 Even in outer darkness, where there is weeping,

334
00:30:43,787 --> 00:30:48,287
 and wailing, and gnashing of teeth

335
00:30:48,08 --> 00:30:53,413
92 Pray ye, therefore, that their ears may be

336
00:30:53,413 --> 00:30:58,746
 opened unto your cries, that I may be merciful unto

337
00:30:58,746 --> 00:31:04,079
 them, that these things may not come upon them

338
00:31:04,096 --> 00:31:09,096
93 What I have said unto you must needs be, that

339
00:31:09,096 --> 00:31:14,096
 all men may be left without excuse

340
00:31:14,389 --> 00:31:19,889
94 That wise men and rulers may hear and know that

341
00:31:19,889 --> 00:31:25,389
 which they have never considered

342
00:31:25,4 --> 00:31:31,65
95 That I may proceed to bring to pass my act, my

343
00:31:31,65 --> 00:31:37,9
 strange act, and perform my work, my strange work,

344
00:31:37,9 --> 00:31:44,15
 that men may discern between the righteous and

345
00:31:44,15 --> 00:31:50,4
 the wicked, saith your God

346
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:55,208
96 And again, I say unto you, it is contrary to my

347
00:31:55,208 --> 00:32:00,008
 commandment and my will that my servant Sidney

348
00:32:00,008 --> 00:32:04,809
 Gilbert should sell my storehouse, which I have

349
00:32:04,809 --> 00:32:09,609
 appointed unto my people, into the hands of mine

350
00:32:09,609 --> 00:32:14,409
 enemies

351
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:18,366
97 Let not that which I have appointed be polluted

352
00:32:18,366 --> 00:32:22,033
 by mine enemies, by the consent of those who call

353
00:32:22,033 --> 00:32:25,7
 themselves after my name

354
00:32:25,71 --> 00:32:30,21
98 For this is a very sore and grievous sin

355
00:32:30,21 --> 00:32:34,71
 against me, and against my people, in consequence of

356
00:32:34,71 --> 00:32:39,21
 those things which I have decreed and which are soon

357
00:32:39,21 --> 00:32:43,71
 to befall the nations

358
00:32:43,478 --> 00:32:48,228
99 Therefore, it is my will that my people should

359
00:32:48,228 --> 00:32:52,978
 claim, and hold claim upon that which I have

360
00:32:52,978 --> 00:32:57,728
 appointed unto them, though they should not be

361
00:32:57,728 --> 00:33:02,478
 permitted to dwell thereon

362
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:07,231
100 Nevertheless, I do not say they shall not

363
00:33:07,231 --> 00:33:11,481
 dwell thereon; for inasmuch as they bring forth fruit

364
00:33:11,481 --> 00:33:15,731
 and works meet for my kingdom they shall dwell

365
00:33:15,731 --> 00:33:19,981
 thereon

366
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:26,431
101 They shall build, and another shall not

367
00:33:26,431 --> 00:33:33,098
 inherit it; they shall plant vineyards, and they shall

368
00:33:33,098 --> 00:33:39,765
 eat the fruit thereof. Even so. Amen.
