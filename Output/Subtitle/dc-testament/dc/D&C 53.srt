Smith the Prophet to Algernon Sidney Gilbert, at

3
00:00:15,25 --> 00:00:22,875
Kirtland, Ohio, June 8, 1831. At Sidney Gilbert’s

4
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:30,5
request, the Prophet inquired of the Lord as

00:00:30,5 --> 00:00:38,125
to Brother Gilbert’s work and appointment in the

6
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:45,75
Church. 
1–3, Sidney Gilbert’s calling and

7
00:00:45,75 --> 00:00:53,375
election in the Church is to be ordained an elder;

00:00:53,375 --> 00:01:01,695

9
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:05,528
1 Behold, I say unto you, my servant Sidney

10
00:01:05,528 --> 00:01:09,361
Gilbert, that I have heard your prayers; and you

11
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:13,194
have called upon me that it should be made

12
00:01:13,194 --> 00:01:17,027
known unto you, of the Lord your God, concerning

13
00:01:17,027 --> 00:01:20,86
your calling and election in the church,

14
00:01:20,86 --> 00:01:24,685
which I, the Lord, have raised up in these last days.

15
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:29,352
2 Behold, I, the Lord, who was crucified

16
00:01:29,352 --> 00:01:34,019
for the sins of the world, give unto you a

17
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:38,999
commandment that you shall forsake the world.

18
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:41,199
3 Take upon you mine ordination, even

19
00:01:41,199 --> 00:01:43,399
that of an elder, to preach faith and

20
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:45,599
repentance and remission of sins,

21
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:47,799
according to my word, and the reception of the

22
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:49,376
Holy Spirit by the laying on of hands;

23
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:51,376
4 And also to be an agent unto this

24
00:01:51,376 --> 00:01:53,376
church in the place which shall be

25
00:01:53,376 --> 00:01:55,376
appointed by the bishop, according to

26
00:01:55,376 --> 00:01:57,818
commandments which shall be given hereafter.

27
00:01:57,818 --> 00:02:01,818
5 And again, verily I say

28
00:02:01,818 --> 00:02:05,818
unto you, you shall take your

29
00:02:05,818 --> 00:02:09,818
journey with my servants Joseph

30
00:02:09,818 --> 00:02:13,3
Smith, Jun., and Sidney Rigdon.

31
00:02:13,3 --> 00:02:15,3
6 Behold, these are the

32
00:02:15,3 --> 00:02:17,3
first ordinances which you

33
00:02:17,3 --> 00:02:19,3
shall receive; and the

34
00:02:19,3 --> 00:02:21,3
residue shall be made known in

35
00:02:21,3 --> 00:02:23,3
a time to come, according

36
00:02:23,3 --> 00:02:25,679
to your labor in my vineyard.

37
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:28,479
7 And again, I would

38
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:31,279
that ye should learn

39
00:02:31,279 --> 00:02:34,079
that he only is saved

40
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:36,879
who endureth unto

41
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,993
the end. Even so. Amen.
