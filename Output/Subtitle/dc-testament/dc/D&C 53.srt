00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:30,403
 Kirtland, Ohio, June 8, 1831. At Sidney Gilbert’s request,

00:00:30,403 --> 00:00:36,778
 the Prophet inquired of the Lord as to Brother

00:00:36,778 --> 00:00:43,153
 Gilbert’s work and appointment in the Church. 
1–3,

6
00:00:43,153 --> 00:00:49,528
 Sidney Gilbert’s calling and election in the

7
00:00:49,528 --> 00:00:55,903
 Church is to be ordained an elder; 
4–7, He is also to

8
00:00:55,903 --> 00:01:02,278
 serve as a bishop’s agent.

9
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:06,029
1 Behold, I say unto you, my servant Sidney

10
00:01:06,029 --> 00:01:09,696
 Gilbert, that I have heard your prayers; and you have

11
00:01:09,696 --> 00:01:13,363
 called upon me that it should be made known unto

12
00:01:13,363 --> 00:01:17,03
 you, of the Lord your God, concerning your calling

13
00:01:17,03 --> 00:01:20,697
 and election in the church, which I, the Lord, have

14
00:01:20,697 --> 00:01:24,364
 raised up in these last days

15
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:29,851
2 Behold, I, the Lord, who was crucified for the

16
00:01:29,851 --> 00:01:34,851
 sins of the world, give unto you a commandment that

17
00:01:34,851 --> 00:01:39,851
 you shall forsake the world

18
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:44,366
3 Take upon you mine ordination, even that of an

19
00:01:44,366 --> 00:01:49,366
 elder, to preach faith and repentance and remission

20
00:01:49,366 --> 00:01:54,366
 of sins, according to my word, and the reception

21
00:01:54,366 --> 00:01:59,366
 of the Holy Spirit by the laying on of hands

22
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:02,586
4 And also to be an agent unto this church in the

23
00:02:02,586 --> 00:02:06,086
 place which shall be appointed by the bishop,

24
00:02:06,086 --> 00:02:09,586
 according to commandments which shall be given

25
00:02:09,586 --> 00:02:13,086
 hereafter

26
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:18,167
5 And again, verily I say unto you, you shall take

27
00:02:18,167 --> 00:02:22,5
 your journey with my servants Joseph Smith, Jun.,

28
00:02:22,5 --> 00:02:26,833
 and Sidney Rigdon

29
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:29,646
6 Behold, these are the first ordinances which you

30
00:02:29,646 --> 00:02:33,146
 shall receive; and the residue shall be made

31
00:02:33,146 --> 00:02:36,646
 known in a time to come, according to your labor in my

32
00:02:36,646 --> 00:02:40,146
 vineyard

33
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:44,661
7 And again, I would that ye should learn that he

34
00:02:44,661 --> 00:02:48,661
 only is saved who endureth unto the end. Even so.

35
00:02:48,661 --> 00:02:52,661
 Amen.
