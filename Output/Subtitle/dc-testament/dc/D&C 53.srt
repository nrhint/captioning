00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0

1 Behold, I say unto you, my servant Sidney

10
00:31:03,0 --> 00:31:03,0
Gilbert, that I have heard your prayers; and you

11
00:31:03,0 --> 00:31:03,0
have called upon me that it should be made

12
00:31:03,0 --> 00:31:03,0
known unto you, of the Lord your God, concerning

13
00:31:03,0 --> 00:31:03,0
your calling and election in the church,

14
00:31:03,0 --> 00:30:35,
which I, the Lord, have raised up in these last days.

15
00:30:35,0 --> 00:30:35,0
2 Behold, I, the Lord, who was crucified

16
00:30:35,0 --> 00:30:35,0
for the sins of the world, give unto you a

17
00:30:35,0 --> 00:32:47,
commandment that you shall forsake the world.

18
00:32:47,0 --> 00:32:47,0
3 Take upon you mine ordination, even

19
00:32:47,0 --> 00:32:47,0
that of an elder, to preach faith and

20
00:32:47,0 --> 00:32:47,0
repentance and remission of sins,

21
00:32:47,0 --> 00:32:47,0
according to my word, and the reception of the

22
00:32:47,0 --> 00:33:59,
Holy Spirit by the laying on of hands;

23
00:33:59,0 --> 00:33:59,0
4 And also to be an agent unto this

24
00:33:59,0 --> 00:33:59,0
church in the place which shall be

25
00:33:59,0 --> 00:33:59,0
appointed by the bishop, according to

26
00:33:59,0 --> 00:42:11,
commandments which shall be given hereafter.

27
00:42:11,0 --> 00:42:11,0
5 And again, verily I say

28
00:42:11,0 --> 00:42:11,0
unto you, you shall take your

29
00:42:11,0 --> 00:42:11,0
journey with my servants Joseph

30
00:42:11,0 --> 00:49:20,
Smith, Jun., and Sidney Rigdon.

31
00:49:20,0 --> 00:49:20,0
6 Behold, these are the

32
00:49:20,0 --> 00:49:20,0
first ordinances which you

33
00:49:20,0 --> 00:49:20,0
shall receive; and the

34
00:49:20,0 --> 00:49:20,0
residue shall be made known in

35
00:49:20,0 --> 00:49:20,0
a time to come, according

36
00:49:20,0 --> 00:58:30,
to your labor in my vineyard.

37
00:58:30,0 --> 00:58:30,0
7 And again, I would

38
00:58:30,0 --> 00:58:30,0
that ye should learn

39
00:58:30,0 --> 00:58:30,0
that he only is saved

40
00:58:30,0 --> 00:58:30,0
who endureth unto

41
00:58:30,0 --> 01:06:42,
the end. Even so. Amen.
