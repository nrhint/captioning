the things which thou hast

28
00:02:41,255 --> 00:02:44,422

29
00:02:44,422 --> 00:02:47,589
withheld from thee and

30
00:02:47,589 --> 00:02:50,756
from the world, which is

31
00:02:50,756 --> 00:02:53,273

afflictions, with consoling

38
00:03:13,847 --> 00:03:17,664

unto him for a scribe,

43
00:03:29,22 --> 00:03:32,109
while there is no

44
00:03:32,109 --> 00:03:34,998
one to be a scribe for

45
00:03:34,998 --> 00:03:37,887
him, that I may send

50
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,848
hand to expound

51
00:03:50,848 --> 00:03:53,134
scriptures, and to exhort

52
00:03:53,134 --> 00:03:55,42
the church,

53
00:03:55,42 --> 00:03:57,706
according as it shall be

54
00:03:57,706 --> 00:03:59,005
given thee by my Spirit.

55
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:01,148
8 For he shall lay

56
00:04:01,148 --> 00:04:03,291

57
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,434
and thou shalt

58
00:04:05,434 --> 00:04:07,577
receive the Holy Ghost,

59
00:04:07,577 --> 00:04:09,72
and thy time shall be

60
00:04:09,72 --> 00:04:11,863

61
00:04:11,863 --> 00:04:14,02
and to learning much.

62
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:16,22
9 And thou needest

63
00:04:16,22 --> 00:04:18,42
not fear, for thy

64
00:04:18,42 --> 00:04:20,62
husband shall

65
00:04:20,62 --> 00:04:22,82
support thee in the

66
00:04:22,82 --> 00:04:25,02
church; for unto them is

67
00:04:25,02 --> 00:04:27,22
his calling, that

68
00:04:27,22 --> 00:04:29,42
all things might be

69
00:04:29,42 --> 00:04:31,62
revealed unto

70
00:04:31,62 --> 00:04:33,82
them, whatsoever I

71
00:04:33,82 --> 00:04:36,309
will, according to their faith.

72
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:37,738
10 And verily I

73
00:04:37,738 --> 00:04:39,167
say unto thee

74
00:04:39,167 --> 00:04:40,596
that thou shalt

75
00:04:40,596 --> 00:04:42,025
lay aside the

76
00:04:42,025 --> 00:04:43,454
things of this

77
00:04:43,454 --> 00:04:44,883
world, and seek for

78
00:04:44,883 --> 00:04:46,686
the things of a better.

79
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,286
11 And it shall

80
00:04:48,286 --> 00:04:49,886
be given thee,

81
00:04:49,886 --> 00:04:51,486
also, to make

82
00:04:51,486 --> 00:04:53,086
a selection of

83
00:04:53,086 --> 00:04:54,686
sacred hymns,

84
00:04:54,686 --> 00:04:56,286
as it shall be

85
00:04:56,286 --> 00:04:57,886
given thee,

86
00:04:57,886 --> 00:04:59,486
which is pleasing

87
00:04:59,486 --> 00:05:01,086
unto me, to be

88
00:05:01,086 --> 00:05:02,169
had in my church.

89
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:02,624
12 For my soul

90
00:05:02,624 --> 00:05:03,079
delighteth in

91
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:03,534
the song of

92
00:05:03,534 --> 00:05:03,989
the heart; yea,

93
00:05:03,989 --> 00:05:04,444
the song of

94
00:05:04,444 --> 00:05:04,899
the righteous

95
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:05,354
is a prayer

96
00:05:05,354 --> 00:05:05,809
unto me, and it

97
00:05:05,809 --> 00:05:06,264
shall be

98
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:06,719
answered with a

99
00:05:06,719 --> 00:05:07,574
blessing upon their heads.

100
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:10,574
13 Wherefore,

101
00:05:10,574 --> 00:05:13,574
lift up thy

102
00:05:13,574 --> 00:05:16,574
heart and

103
00:05:16,574 --> 00:05:19,574
rejoice, and

104
00:05:19,574 --> 00:05:22,574
cleave unto the

105
00:05:22,574 --> 00:05:25,574
covenants

106
00:05:25,574 --> 00:05:28,929
which thou hast made.

107
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:30,111
14 Continue

108
00:05:30,111 --> 00:05:31,293
in the

109
00:05:31,293 --> 00:05:32,475
spirit of

110
00:05:32,475 --> 00:05:33,657
meekness, and

111
00:05:33,657 --> 00:05:34,839
beware of pride.

112
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:36,021
Let thy soul

113
00:05:36,021 --> 00:05:37,203
delight in

114
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:38,385
thy husband,

115
00:05:38,385 --> 00:05:39,567
and the

116
00:05:39,567 --> 00:05:40,749
glory which

117
00:05:40,749 --> 00:05:41,308
shall come upon him.

118
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:43,141
15 Keep my

119
00:05:43,141 --> 00:05:44,974


120
00:05:44,974 --> 00:05:46,807
commandments

121
00:05:46,807 --> 00:05:48,64
continually, and a

122
00:05:48,64 --> 00:05:50,473
crown of

123
00:05:50,473 --> 00:05:52,306
righteousness

124
00:05:52,306 --> 00:05:54,139
thou shalt

125
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:55,972
receive.

126
00:05:55,972 --> 00:05:57,805
And except

127
00:05:57,805 --> 00:05:59,638
thou do this,

128
00:05:59,638 --> 00:06:01,471
where I am

129
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,129
you cannot come.

130
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:05,129
16 And

131
00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:07,129
verily, verily,

132
00:06:07,129 --> 00:06:09,129
I say unto

133
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:11,129
you, that

134
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:13,129
this is my

135
00:06:13,129 --> 00:06:15,129
voice unto

136
00:06:15,129 --> 00:06:17,41
all. Amen.
