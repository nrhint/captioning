30
01:09:32,0 --> 01:09:32,0
from the world, which is

01:17:16,0 --> 01:26:26,
words, in the spirit of meekness.

01:26:26,0 --> 01:26:26,0
one to be a scribe for

45
01:26:26,0 --> 01:26:26,0
him, that I may send

01:38:37,0 --> 01:38:37,0

01:38:37,0 --> 01:38:37,0
hand to expound

51
01:38:37,0 --> 01:38:37,0
scriptures, and to exhort

52
01:38:37,0 --> 01:38:37,0
the church,

53
01:38:37,0 --> 01:38:37,0
according as it shall be

54
01:38:37,0 --> 01:51:46,
given thee by my Spirit.

55
01:51:46,0 --> 01:51:46,0
8 For he shall lay

56
01:51:46,0 --> 01:51:46,0
his hands upon thee,

57
01:51:46,0 --> 01:51:46,0
and thou shalt

58
01:51:46,0 --> 01:51:46,0
receive the Holy Ghost,

01:51:46,0 --> 01:51:46,0
and thy time shall be

60
01:51:46,0 --> 01:51:46,0
given to writing,

61
01:51:46,0 --> 01:59:16,
and to learning much.

62
01:59:16,0 --> 01:59:16,0
9 And thou needest

63
01:59:16,0 --> 01:59:16,0
not fear, for thy

64
01:59:16,0 --> 01:59:16,0
husband shall

65
01:59:16,0 --> 01:59:16,0
support thee in the

66
01:59:16,0 --> 01:59:16,0
church; for unto them is

67
01:59:16,0 --> 01:59:16,0
his calling, that

68
01:59:16,0 --> 01:59:16,0
all things might be

69
01:59:16,0 --> 01:59:16,0
revealed unto

70
01:59:16,0 --> 01:59:16,0
them, whatsoever I

71
01:59:16,0 --> 02:06:46,
will, according to their faith.

72
02:06:46,0 --> 02:06:46,0
10 And verily I

73
02:06:46,0 --> 02:06:46,0
say unto thee

74
02:06:46,0 --> 02:06:46,0
that thou shalt

75
02:06:46,0 --> 02:06:46,0
lay aside the

76
02:06:46,0 --> 02:06:46,0
things of this

77
02:06:46,0 --> 02:06:46,0
world, and seek for

78
02:06:46,0 --> 02:18:15,
the things of a better.

79
02:18:15,0 --> 02:18:15,0
11 And it shall

80
02:18:15,0 --> 02:18:15,0
be given thee,

81
02:18:15,0 --> 02:18:15,0
also, to make

82
02:18:15,0 --> 02:18:15,0
a selection of

83
02:18:15,0 --> 02:18:15,0
sacred hymns,

84
02:18:15,0 --> 02:18:15,0
as it shall be

85
02:18:15,0 --> 02:18:15,0
given thee,

86
02:18:15,0 --> 02:18:15,0
which is pleasing

87
02:18:15,0 --> 02:18:15,0
unto me, to be

88
02:18:15,0 --> 02:23:26,
had in my church.

89
02:23:26,0 --> 02:23:26,0
12 For my soul

90
02:23:26,0 --> 02:23:26,0
delighteth in

91
02:23:26,0 --> 02:23:26,0
the song of

92
02:23:26,0 --> 02:23:26,0
the heart; yea,

93
02:23:26,0 --> 02:23:26,0
the song of

94
02:23:26,0 --> 02:23:26,0
the righteous

95
02:23:26,0 --> 02:23:26,0
is a prayer

96
02:23:26,0 --> 02:23:26,0
unto me, and it

97
02:23:26,0 --> 02:23:26,0
shall be

98
02:23:26,0 --> 02:23:26,0
answered with a

99
02:23:26,0 --> 02:25:38,
blessing upon their heads.

100
02:25:38,0 --> 02:25:38,0
13 Wherefore,

101
02:25:38,0 --> 02:25:38,0
lift up thy

102
02:25:38,0 --> 02:25:38,0
heart and

103
02:25:38,0 --> 02:25:38,0
rejoice, and

104
02:25:38,0 --> 02:25:38,0
cleave unto the

105
02:25:38,0 --> 02:25:38,0
covenants

106
02:25:38,0 --> 02:31:49,
which thou hast made.

107
02:31:49,0 --> 02:31:49,0
14 Continue

108
02:31:49,0 --> 02:31:49,0
in the

109
02:31:49,0 --> 02:31:49,0
spirit of

110
02:31:49,0 --> 02:31:49,0
meekness, and

111
02:31:49,0 --> 02:31:49,0
beware of pride.

112
02:31:49,0 --> 02:31:49,0
Let thy soul

113
02:31:49,0 --> 02:31:49,0
delight in

114
02:31:49,0 --> 02:31:49,0
thy husband,

115
02:31:49,0 --> 02:31:49,0
and the

116
02:31:49,0 --> 02:31:49,0
glory which

117
02:31:49,0 --> 02:33:01,
shall come upon him.

118
02:33:01,0 --> 02:33:01,0
15 Keep my

119
02:33:01,0 --> 02:33:01,0


120
02:33:01,0 --> 02:33:01,0
commandments

121
02:33:01,0 --> 02:33:01,0
continually, and a

122
02:33:01,0 --> 02:33:01,0
crown of

123
02:33:01,0 --> 02:33:01,0
righteousness

124
02:33:01,0 --> 02:33:01,0
thou shalt

125
02:33:01,0 --> 02:33:01,0
receive.

126
02:33:01,0 --> 02:33:01,0
And except

127
02:33:01,0 --> 02:33:01,0
thou do this,

128
02:33:01,0 --> 02:33:01,0
where I am

129
02:33:01,0 --> 02:36:31,
you cannot come.

130
02:36:31,0 --> 02:36:31,0
16 And

131
02:36:31,0 --> 02:36:31,0
verily, verily,

132
02:36:31,0 --> 02:36:31,0
I say unto

133
02:36:31,0 --> 02:36:31,0
you, that

134
02:36:31,0 --> 02:36:31,0
this is my

135
02:36:31,0 --> 02:36:31,0
voice unto

136
02:36:31,0 --> 02:38:43,
all. Amen.
