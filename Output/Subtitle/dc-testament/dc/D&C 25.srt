00:01:37,241 --> 00:01:42,991
 while I speak unto you, Emma Smith, my daughter; for

14
00:01:42,991 --> 00:01:48,741
 verily I say unto you, all those who receive my

15
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:54,491
 gospel are sons and daughters in my kingdom

16
00:01:54,214 --> 00:02:00,964
2 A revelation I give unto you concerning my will;

17
00:02:00,964 --> 00:02:07,714
 and if thou art faithful and walk in the paths of

18
00:02:07,714 --> 00:02:14,464
 virtue before me, I will preserve thy life, and

19
00:02:14,464 --> 00:02:21,214
 thou shalt receive an inheritance in Zion

20
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:28,175
3 Behold, thy sins are forgiven thee, and thou art

21
00:02:28,175 --> 00:02:34,675
 an elect lady, whom I have called

22
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:39,955
4 Murmur not because of the things which thou hast

23
00:02:39,955 --> 00:02:44,955
 not seen, for they are withheld from thee and

24
00:02:44,955 --> 00:02:49,955
 from the world, which is wisdom in me in a time to

25
00:02:49,955 --> 00:02:54,955
 come

26
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:59,991
5 And the office of thy calling shall be for a

27
00:02:59,991 --> 00:03:05,741
 comfort unto my servant, Joseph Smith, Jun., thy

28
00:03:05,741 --> 00:03:11,491
 husband, in his afflictions, with consoling words, in

29
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:17,241
 the spirit of meekness

30
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:24,931
6 And thou shalt go with him at the time of his

31
00:03:24,931 --> 00:03:31,931
 going, and be unto him for a scribe, while there is

32
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:38,931
 no one to be a scribe for him, that I may send my

33
00:03:38,931 --> 00:03:45,931
 servant, Oliver Cowdery, whithersoever I will

34
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:49,725
7 And thou shalt be ordained under his hand to

35
00:03:49,725 --> 00:03:54,058
 expound scriptures, and to exhort the church,

36
00:03:54,058 --> 00:03:58,391
 according as it shall be given thee by my Spirit

37
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:03,905
8 For he shall lay his hands upon thee, and thou

38
00:04:03,905 --> 00:04:08,905
 shalt receive the Holy Ghost, and thy time shall be

39
00:04:08,905 --> 00:04:13,905
 given to writing, and to learning much

40
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:19,637
9 And thou needest not fear, for thy husband shall

41
00:04:19,637 --> 00:04:25,387
 support thee in the church; for unto them is his

42
00:04:25,387 --> 00:04:31,137
 calling, that all things might be revealed unto

43
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:36,887
 them, whatsoever I will, according to their faith

44
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:40,843
10 And verily I say unto thee that thou shalt lay

45
00:04:40,843 --> 00:04:44,843
 aside the things of this world, and seek for the

46
00:04:44,843 --> 00:04:48,843
 things of a better

47
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:53,822
11 And it shall be given thee, also, to make a

48
00:04:53,822 --> 00:04:58,822
 selection of sacred hymns, as it shall be given thee,

49
00:04:58,822 --> 00:05:03,822
 which is pleasing unto me, to be had in my

50
00:05:03,822 --> 00:05:08,822
 church

51
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:13,792
12 For my soul delighteth in the song of the

52
00:05:13,792 --> 00:05:19,042
 heart; yea, the song of the righteous is a prayer unto

53
00:05:19,042 --> 00:05:24,292
 me, and it shall be answered with a blessing upon

54
00:05:24,292 --> 00:05:29,542
 their heads

55
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:36,029
13 Wherefore, lift up thy heart and rejoice, and

56
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:42,529
 cleave unto the covenants which thou hast made

57
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:49,642
14 Continue in the spirit of meekness, and beware

58
00:05:49,642 --> 00:05:56,975
 of pride. Let thy soul delight in thy husband, and

59
00:05:56,975 --> 00:06:04,308
 the glory which shall come upon him

60
00:06:04,03 --> 00:06:12,03
15 Keep my commandments continually, and a crown

61
00:06:12,03 --> 00:06:20,03
 of righteousness thou shalt receive. And except

62
00:06:20,03 --> 00:06:28,03
 thou do this, where I am you cannot come

63
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:34,788
16 And verily, verily, I say unto you, that this

64
00:06:34,788 --> 00:06:40,788
 is my voice unto all. Amen.
