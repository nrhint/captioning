Smith was sustained and ordained President of the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0

1 Verily, verily, I say unto you, I who

13
01:39:27,0 --> 01:39:27,0

14
01:39:27,0 --> 01:54:29,
Alpha and Omega, your Lord and your God—

15
01:54:29,0 --> 01:54:29,0
2 Hearken, O ye who have given

16
01:54:29,0 --> 01:54:29,0
your names to go forth to proclaim my

17
01:54:29,0 --> 02:08:33,
gospel, and to prune my vineyard.

18
02:08:33,0 --> 02:08:33,0
3 Behold, I say unto you that

19
02:08:33,0 --> 02:08:33,0
it is my will that you should go

20
02:08:33,0 --> 02:08:33,0
forth and not tarry, neither

21
02:08:33,0 --> 02:23:35,
be idle but labor with your might—

22
02:23:35,0 --> 02:23:35,0
4 Lifting up your voices as

23
02:23:35,0 --> 02:23:35,0
with the sound of a trump,

24
02:23:35,0 --> 02:23:35,0
proclaiming the truth according

25
02:23:35,0 --> 02:23:35,0
to the revelations and

26
02:23:35,0 --> 02:38:37,
commandments which I have given you.

27
02:38:37,0 --> 02:38:37,0
5 And thus, if ye are

28
02:38:37,0 --> 02:38:37,0
faithful ye shall be laden with

29
02:38:37,0 --> 02:38:37,0
many sheaves, and crowned

30
02:38:37,0 --> 02:38:37,0
with honor, and glory, and

31
02:38:37,0 --> 02:49:37,
immortality, and eternal life.

32
02:49:37,0 --> 02:49:37,0
6 Therefore, verily I

33
02:49:37,0 --> 02:49:37,0
say unto my servant

34
02:49:37,0 --> 02:49:37,0
William E. McLellin, I

35
02:49:37,0 --> 02:49:37,0
revoke the commission which

36
02:49:37,0 --> 02:49:37,0
I gave unto him to go

37
02:49:37,0 --> 02:45:17,
unto the eastern countries;

38
02:45:17,0 --> 02:45:17,0
7 And I give unto him

39
02:45:17,0 --> 02:45:17,0
a new commission and a

40
02:45:17,0 --> 02:45:17,0
new commandment, in

41
02:45:17,0 --> 02:45:17,0
the which I, the Lord,

42
02:45:17,0 --> 02:45:17,0
chasten him for the

43
02:45:17,0 --> 03:00:19,
murmurings of his heart;

44
03:00:19,0 --> 03:00:19,0
8 And he sinned;

45
03:00:19,0 --> 03:00:19,0
nevertheless, I forgive

46
03:00:19,0 --> 03:00:19,0
him and say unto

47
03:00:19,0 --> 03:00:19,0
him again, Go ye into

48
03:00:19,0 --> 03:15:21,
the south countries.

49
03:15:21,0 --> 03:15:21,0
9 And let my

50
03:15:21,0 --> 03:15:21,0
servant Luke Johnson go

51
03:15:21,0 --> 03:15:21,0
with him, and

52
03:15:21,0 --> 03:15:21,0
proclaim the things which

53
03:15:21,0 --> 03:24:24,
I have commanded them—

54
03:24:24,0 --> 03:24:24,0
10 Calling on

55
03:24:24,0 --> 03:24:24,0
the name of the

56
03:24:24,0 --> 03:24:24,0
Lord for the

57
03:24:24,0 --> 03:24:24,0
Comforter, which

58
03:24:24,0 --> 03:24:24,0
shall teach them all

59
03:24:24,0 --> 03:24:24,0
things that are

60
03:24:24,0 --> 03:33:27,
expedient for them—

61
03:33:27,0 --> 03:33:27,0
11 Praying

62
03:33:27,0 --> 03:33:27,0
always that they

63
03:33:27,0 --> 03:33:27,0
faint not; and

64
03:33:27,0 --> 03:33:27,0
inasmuch as they

65
03:33:27,0 --> 03:33:27,0
do this, I will

66
03:33:27,0 --> 03:33:27,0

67
03:33:27,0 --> 03:45:05,

03:45:05,0 --> 03:45:05,0
12 Behold,

69
03:45:05,0 --> 03:45:05,0
this is the

70

will of the Lord

71
03:45:05,0 --> 03:45:05,0
your God

72
03:45:05,0 --> 03:45:05,0
