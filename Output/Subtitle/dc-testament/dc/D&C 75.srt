 sustained and ordained President of the High

4
00:00:35,551 --> 00:00:43,642
 Priesthood. Certain elders desired to learn more about

5
00:00:43,642 --> 00:00:51,733
 their immediate duties. These revelations

6
00:00:51,733 --> 00:00:59,824
 followed. 
1–5, Faithful elders who preach the gospel

6–12, Pray to receive the

00:01:07,915 --> 00:01:16,006
 Comforter, who teaches all things; 
13–22, Elders

9
00:01:16,006 --> 00:01:24,097

 message; 
23–36, Families of missionaries are to

11
00:01:32,188 --> 00:01:40,279
 receive help from the Church.

12
00:01:40,217 --> 00:01:45,217
1 Verily, verily, I say unto you, I who speak even

13
00:01:45,217 --> 00:01:50,217
 by the voice of my Spirit, even Alpha and Omega,

14
00:01:50,217 --> 00:01:55,217
 your Lord and your God

15
00:01:55,966 --> 00:02:00,633
2 Hearken, O ye who have given your names to go

16
00:02:00,633 --> 00:02:05,3
 forth to proclaim my gospel, and to prune my

17
00:02:05,3 --> 00:02:09,967
 vineyard

18
00:02:09,513 --> 00:02:14,513
3 Behold, I say unto you that it is my will that

19
00:02:14,513 --> 00:02:19,513
 you should go forth and not tarry, neither be idle

20
00:02:19,513 --> 00:02:24,513
 but labor with your might

21
00:02:24,127 --> 00:02:29,46
4 Lifting up your voices as with the sound of a

22
00:02:29,46 --> 00:02:34,793
 trump, proclaiming the truth according to the

23
00:02:34,793 --> 00:02:40,126
 revelations and commandments which I have given you

24
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:47,193
5 And thus, if ye are faithful ye shall be laden

25
00:02:47,193 --> 00:02:54,193
 with many sheaves, and crowned with honor, and

26
00:02:54,193 --> 00:03:01,193
 glory, and immortality, and eternal life

27
00:03:01,465 --> 00:03:06,132
6 Therefore, verily I say unto my servant

28
00:03:06,132 --> 00:03:10,799
 William E. McLellin, I revoke the commission which I gave

29
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:15,466
 unto him to go unto the eastern countries

30
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:19,312
7 And I give unto him a new commission and a new

31
00:03:19,312 --> 00:03:22,645
 commandment, in the which I, the Lord, chasten him

32
00:03:22,645 --> 00:03:25,978
 for the murmurings of his heart

33
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:29,322
8 And he sinned; nevertheless, I forgive him and

34
00:03:29,322 --> 00:03:32,655
 say unto him again, Go ye into the south countries

35
00:03:32,655 --> 00:03:35,988


36
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:40,015
9 And let my servant Luke Johnson go with him, and

37
00:03:40,015 --> 00:03:45,015
 proclaim the things which I have commanded them

38
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,975
10 Calling on the name of the Lord for the

39
00:03:47,975 --> 00:03:50,642
 Comforter, which shall teach them all things that are

40
00:03:50,642 --> 00:03:53,309
 expedient for them

41
00:03:53,617 --> 00:03:58,284
11 Praying always that they faint not; and

42
00:03:58,284 --> 00:04:02,951
 inasmuch as they do this, I will be with them even unto

43
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:07,618
 the end

44
00:04:07,38 --> 00:04:11,38
12 Behold, this is the will of the Lord your God

45
00:04:11,38 --> 00:04:15,38
 concerning you. Even so. Amen

46
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:19,856
13 And again, verily thus saith the Lord, let my

47
00:04:19,856 --> 00:04:24,023
 servant Orson Hyde and my servant Samuel H. Smith

48
00:04:24,023 --> 00:04:28,19
 take their journey into the eastern countries, and

49
00:04:28,19 --> 00:04:32,357
 proclaim the things which I have commanded them;

50
00:04:32,357 --> 00:04:36,524
 and inasmuch as they are faithful, lo, I will be

51
00:04:36,524 --> 00:04:40,691
 with them even unto the end

52
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:44,497
14 And again, verily I say unto my servant Lyman

53
00:04:44,497 --> 00:04:48,297
 Johnson, and unto my servant Orson Pratt, they

54
00:04:48,297 --> 00:04:52,097
 shall also take their journey into the eastern

55
00:04:52,097 --> 00:04:55,897
 countries; and behold, and lo, I am with them also, even

56
00:04:55,897 --> 00:04:59,697
 unto the end

57
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,766
15 And again, I say unto my servant Asa Dodds, and

58
00:05:03,766 --> 00:05:07,566
 unto my servant Calves Wilson, that they also

59
00:05:07,566 --> 00:05:11,366
 shall take their journey unto the western countries,

60
00:05:11,366 --> 00:05:15,166
 and proclaim my gospel, even as I have commanded

61
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:18,966
 them

62
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:23,485
16 And he who is faithful shall overcome all

63
00:05:23,485 --> 00:05:27,985
 things, and shall be lifted up at the last day

64
00:05:27,777 --> 00:05:33,444
17 And again, I say unto my servant Major N.

65
00:05:33,444 --> 00:05:39,111
 Ashley, and my servant Burr Riggs, let them take their

66
00:05:39,111 --> 00:05:44,778
 journey also into the south country

67
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:51,311
18 Yea, let all those take their journey, as I

68
00:05:51,311 --> 00:05:58,311
 have commanded them, going from house to house, and

69
00:05:58,311 --> 00:06:05,311
 from village to village, and from city to city

70
00:06:05,582 --> 00:06:10,082
19 And in whatsoever house ye enter, and they

71
00:06:10,082 --> 00:06:14,582
 receive you, leave your blessing upon that house

72
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:19,608
20 And in whatsoever house ye enter, and they

73
00:06:19,608 --> 00:06:24,608
 receive you not, ye shall depart speedily from that

74
00:06:24,608 --> 00:06:29,608
 house, and shake off the dust of your feet as a

75
00:06:29,608 --> 00:06:34,608
 testimony against them

76
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:39,594
21 And you shall be filled with joy and gladness;

77
00:06:39,594 --> 00:06:44,594
 and know this, that in the day of judgment you

78
00:06:44,594 --> 00:06:49,594
 shall be judges of that house, and condemn them

79
00:06:49,593 --> 00:06:55,593
22 And it shall be more tolerable for the heathen

80
00:06:55,593 --> 00:07:01,593
 in the day of judgment, than for that house;

81
00:07:01,593 --> 00:07:07,593
 therefore, gird up your loins and be faithful, and ye

82
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:13,593
 shall overcome all things, and be lifted up at the

83
00:07:13,593 --> 00:07:19,593
 last day. Even so. Amen

84
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:24,089
23 And again, thus saith the Lord unto you, O ye

85
00:07:24,089 --> 00:07:29,089
 elders of my church, who have given your names that

86
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:34,089
 you might know his will concerning you

87
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:38,087
24 Behold, I say unto you, that it is the duty of

88
00:07:38,087 --> 00:07:42,087
 the church to assist in supporting the families of

89
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:46,087
 those, and also to support the families of those

90
00:07:46,087 --> 00:07:50,087
 who are called and must needs be sent unto the

91
00:07:50,087 --> 00:07:54,087
 world to proclaim the gospel unto the world

92
00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:58,874
25 Wherefore, I, the Lord, give unto you this

93
00:07:58,874 --> 00:08:03,374
 commandment, that ye obtain places for your families,

94
00:08:03,374 --> 00:08:07,874
 inasmuch as your brethren are willing to open

95
00:08:07,874 --> 00:08:12,374
 their hearts

96
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:18,392
26 And let all such as can obtain places for their

97
00:08:18,392 --> 00:08:24,392
 families, and support of the church for them, not

98
00:08:24,392 --> 00:08:30,392
 fail to go into the world, whether to the east or

99
00:08:30,392 --> 00:08:36,392
 to the west, or to the north, or to the south

100
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:41,666
27 Let them ask and they shall receive, knock and

101
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:46,416
 it shall be opened unto them, and be made known

102
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:51,166
 from on high, even by the Comforter, whither they

103
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:55,916
 shall go

104
00:08:55,685 --> 00:09:01,185
28 And again, verily I say unto you, that every

105
00:09:01,185 --> 00:09:06,685
 man who is obliged to provide for his own family,

106
00:09:06,685 --> 00:09:12,185
 let him provide, and he shall in nowise lose his

107
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:17,685
 crown; and let him labor in the church

108
00:09:17,19 --> 00:09:23,19
29 Let every man be diligent in all things. And

109
00:09:23,19 --> 00:09:29,19
 the idler shall not have place in the church, except

110
00:09:29,19 --> 00:09:35,19
 he repent and mend his ways

111
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:42,975
30 Wherefore, let my servant Simeon Carter and my

112
00:09:42,975 --> 00:09:50,475

113
00:09:50,974 --> 00:09:56,974
