00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:17,663
Section 89 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:17,663 --> 00:00:24,048
 the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, February 27, 1833.

3
00:00:24,048 --> 00:00:30,433
 As a consequence of the early brethren using

4
00:00:30,433 --> 00:00:36,818
 tobacco in their meetings, the Prophet was led to

5
00:00:36,818 --> 00:00:43,203
 ponder upon the matter; consequently, he inquired of

6
00:00:43,203 --> 00:00:49,588
 the Lord concerning it. This revelation, known as

7
00:00:49,588 --> 00:00:55,973
 the Word of Wisdom, was the result. 
1–9, The use of

8
00:00:55,973 --> 00:01:02,358
 wine, strong drinks, tobacco, and hot drinks is

9
00:01:02,358 --> 00:01:08,743
 proscribed; 
10–17, Herbs, fruits, flesh, and grain

10
00:01:08,743 --> 00:01:15,128
 are ordained for the use of man and of animals;

11
00:01:15,128 --> 00:01:21,513
18–21, Obedience to gospel law, including the Word

12
00:01:21,513 --> 00:01:27,898
 of Wisdom, brings temporal and spiritual

13
00:01:27,898 --> 00:01:34,283
 blessings.

14
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:39,527
1 A Word of Wisdom, for the benefit of the council

15
00:01:39,527 --> 00:01:44,86
 of high priests, assembled in Kirtland, and the

16
00:01:44,86 --> 00:01:50,193
 church, and also the saints in Zion

17
00:01:50,494 --> 00:01:55,744
2 To be sent greeting; not by commandment or

18
00:01:55,744 --> 00:02:00,994
 constraint, but by revelation and the word of wisdom,

19
00:02:00,994 --> 00:02:06,244
 showing forth the order and will of God in the

20
00:02:06,244 --> 00:02:11,494
 temporal salvation of all saints in the last days

21
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:17,765
3 Given for a principle with promise, adapted to

22
00:02:17,765 --> 00:02:23,765
 the capacity of the weak and the weakest of all

23
00:02:23,765 --> 00:02:29,765
 saints, who are or can be called saints

24
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:34,482
4 Behold, verily, thus saith the Lord unto you: In

25
00:02:34,482 --> 00:02:39,682
 consequence of evils and designs which do and

26
00:02:39,682 --> 00:02:44,882
 will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in the

27
00:02:44,882 --> 00:02:50,082
 last days, I have warned you, and forewarn you, by

28
00:02:50,082 --> 00:02:55,282
 giving unto you this word of wisdom by revelation

29
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:59,242
5 That inasmuch as any man drinketh wine or strong

30
00:02:59,242 --> 00:03:03,442
 drink among you, behold it is not good, neither

31
00:03:03,442 --> 00:03:07,642
 meet in the sight of your Father, only in

32
00:03:07,642 --> 00:03:11,842
 assembling yourselves together to offer up your sacraments

33
00:03:11,842 --> 00:03:16,042
 before him

34
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:22,797
6 And, behold, this should be wine, yea, pure wine

35
00:03:22,797 --> 00:03:28,797
 of the grape of the vine, of your own make

36
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:33,308
7 And, again, strong drinks are not for the belly,

37
00:03:33,308 --> 00:03:38,308
 but for the washing of your bodies

38
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:44,385
8 And again, tobacco is not for the body, neither

39
00:03:44,385 --> 00:03:50,135
 for the belly, and is not good for man, but is an

40
00:03:50,135 --> 00:03:55,885
 herb for bruises and all sick cattle, to be used

41
00:03:55,885 --> 00:04:01,635
 with judgment and skill

42
00:04:01,892 --> 00:04:05,392
9 And again, hot drinks are not for the body or

43
00:04:05,392 --> 00:04:08,892
 belly

44
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:13,082
10 And again, verily I say unto you, all wholesome

45
00:04:13,082 --> 00:04:17,749
 herbs God hath ordained for the constitution,

46
00:04:17,749 --> 00:04:22,416
 nature, and use of man

47
00:04:22,412 --> 00:04:27,745
11 Every herb in the season thereof, and every

48
00:04:27,745 --> 00:04:33,078
 fruit in the season thereof; all these to be used

49
00:04:33,078 --> 00:04:38,411
 with prudence and thanksgiving

50
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:42,945
12 Yea, flesh also of beasts and of the fowls of

51
00:04:42,945 --> 00:04:46,945
 the air, I, the Lord, have ordained for the use of

52
00:04:46,945 --> 00:04:50,945
 man with thanksgiving; nevertheless they are to be

53
00:04:50,945 --> 00:04:54,945
 used sparingly

54
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:59,928
13 And it is pleasing unto me that they should not

55
00:04:59,928 --> 00:05:04,928
 be used, only in times of winter, or of cold, or

56
00:05:04,928 --> 00:05:09,928
 famine

57
00:05:09,693 --> 00:05:15,693
14 All grain is ordained for the use of man and of

58
00:05:15,693 --> 00:05:21,693
 beasts, to be the staff of life, not only for man

59
00:05:21,693 --> 00:05:27,693
 but for the beasts of the field, and the fowls of

60
00:05:27,693 --> 00:05:33,693
 heaven, and all wild animals that run or creep on

61
00:05:33,693 --> 00:05:39,693
 the earth

62
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:46,173
15 And these hath God made for the use of man only

63
00:05:46,173 --> 00:05:52,673
 in times of famine and excess of hunger

64
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:59,353
16 All grain is good for the food of man; as also

65
00:05:59,353 --> 00:06:06,02
 the fruit of the vine; that which yieldeth fruit,

66
00:06:06,02 --> 00:06:12,687
 whether in the ground or above the ground

67
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:19,672
17 Nevertheless, wheat for man, and corn for the

68
00:06:19,672 --> 00:06:26,672
 ox, and oats for the horse, and rye for the fowls

69
00:06:26,672 --> 00:06:33,672
 and for swine, and for all beasts of the field, and

70
00:06:33,672 --> 00:06:40,672
 barley for all useful animals, and for mild

71
00:06:40,672 --> 00:06:47,672
 drinks, as also other grain

72
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:53,157
18 And all saints who remember to keep and do

73
00:06:53,157 --> 00:06:58,657
 these sayings, walking in obedience to the

74
00:06:58,657 --> 00:07:04,157
 commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow

75
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:09,657
 to their bones

76
00:07:09,93 --> 00:07:16,43
19 And shall find wisdom and great treasures of

77
00:07:16,43 --> 00:07:22,93
 knowledge, even hidden treasures

78
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:26,442
20 And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk

79
00:07:26,442 --> 00:07:29,942
 and not faint

80
00:07:29,232 --> 00:07:35,899
21 And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that

81
00:07:35,899 --> 00:07:42,566
 the destroying angel shall pass by them, as the

82
00:07:42,566 --> 00:07:49,233
 children of Israel, and not slay them. Amen.
