00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 89 Revelation given through Joseph

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, February

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
27, 1833. As a consequence of the early brethren

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
using tobacco in their meetings, the Prophet

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
was led to ponder upon the matter;

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
consequently, he inquired of the Lord concerning it. This

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
revelation, known as the Word of Wisdom, was

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the result. 
1–9, The use of wine, strong

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
drinks, tobacco, and hot drinks is proscribed;

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
10–17, Herbs, fruits, flesh, and grain are

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
ordained for the use of man and of animals; 
18–21,

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Obedience to gospel law, including the Word

13
00:00:00,0 --> 01:32:54,
of Wisdom, brings temporal and spiritual blessings. 

14
01:32:54,0 --> 01:32:54,0
1 A Word of Wisdom, for the benefit of the

15
01:32:54,0 --> 01:32:54,0
council of high priests, assembled in Kirtland,

16
01:32:54,0 --> 01:32:32,
and the church, and also the saints in Zion—

17
01:32:32,0 --> 01:32:32,0
2 To be sent greeting; not by

18
01:32:32,0 --> 01:32:32,0
commandment or constraint, but by revelation and

19
01:32:32,0 --> 01:32:32,0
the word of wisdom, showing forth the

20
01:32:32,0 --> 01:32:32,0
order and will of God in the temporal

21
01:32:32,0 --> 01:28:12,
salvation of all saints in the last days—

22
01:28:12,0 --> 01:28:12,0
3 Given for a principle with

23
01:28:12,0 --> 01:28:12,0
promise, adapted to the capacity of the

24
01:28:12,0 --> 01:28:12,0
weak and the weakest of all

25
01:28:12,0 --> 01:33:17,
saints, who are or can be called saints.

26
01:33:17,0 --> 01:33:17,0
4 Behold, verily, thus saith

27
01:33:17,0 --> 01:33:17,0
the Lord unto you: In consequence

28
01:33:17,0 --> 01:33:17,0
of evils and designs which do

29
01:33:17,0 --> 01:33:17,0
and will exist in the hearts of

30
01:33:17,0 --> 01:33:17,0
conspiring men in the last

31
01:33:17,0 --> 01:33:17,0
days, I have warned you, and

32
01:33:17,0 --> 01:33:17,0
forewarn you, by giving unto you

33
01:33:17,0 --> 01:34:21,
this word of wisdom by revelation—

34
01:34:21,0 --> 01:34:21,0
5 That inasmuch as any man

35
01:34:21,0 --> 01:34:21,0
drinketh wine or strong drink

36
01:34:21,0 --> 01:34:21,0
among you, behold it is not good,

37
01:34:21,0 --> 01:34:21,0
neither meet in the sight of

38
01:34:21,0 --> 01:34:21,0
your Father, only in

39
01:34:21,0 --> 01:34:21,0
assembling yourselves together to offer

40
01:34:21,0 --> 01:49:23,
up your sacraments before him.

41
01:49:23,0 --> 01:49:23,0
6 And, behold, this

42
01:49:23,0 --> 01:49:23,0
should be wine, yea, pure

43
01:49:23,0 --> 01:49:23,0
wine of the grape of

44
01:49:23,0 --> 02:10:26,
the vine, of your own make.

45
02:10:26,0 --> 02:10:26,0
7 And, again, strong

46
02:10:26,0 --> 02:10:26,0
drinks are not for

47
02:10:26,0 --> 02:10:26,0
the belly, but for the

48
02:10:26,0 --> 02:28:28,
washing of your bodies.

49
02:28:28,0 --> 02:28:28,0
8 And again,

50
02:28:28,0 --> 02:28:28,0
tobacco is not for the

51
02:28:28,0 --> 02:28:28,0
body, neither for the

52
02:28:28,0 --> 02:28:28,0
belly, and is not

53
02:28:28,0 --> 02:28:28,0
good for man, but

54
02:28:28,0 --> 02:28:28,0
is an herb for

55
02:28:28,0 --> 02:28:28,0
bruises and all sick

56
02:28:28,0 --> 02:28:28,0
cattle, to be used

57
02:28:28,0 --> 02:53:29,
with judgment and skill.

58
02:53:29,0 --> 02:53:29,0
9 And again, hot

59
02:53:29,0 --> 02:53:29,0
drinks are not for

60
02:53:29,0 --> 03:14:32,
the body or belly.

61
03:14:32,0 --> 03:14:32,0
10 And again,

62
03:14:32,0 --> 03:14:32,0
verily I say unto

63
03:14:32,0 --> 03:14:32,0
you, all wholesome

64
03:14:32,0 --> 03:14:32,0
herbs God hath

65
03:14:32,0 --> 03:14:32,0
ordained for the

66
03:14:32,0 --> 03:14:32,0
constitution,

67
03:14:32,0 --> 03:15:36,
nature, and use of man—

68
03:15:36,0 --> 03:15:36,0
11 Every herb in

69
03:15:36,0 --> 03:15:36,0
the season

70
03:15:36,0 --> 03:15:36,0
thereof, and every

71
03:15:36,0 --> 03:15:36,0
fruit in the

72
03:15:36,0 --> 03:15:36,0
season thereof; all

73
03:15:36,0 --> 03:15:36,0
these to be used

74
03:15:36,0 --> 03:15:36,0
with prudence

75
03:15:36,0 --> 03:27:42,
and thanksgiving.

76
03:27:42,0 --> 03:27:42,0
12 Yea, flesh

77
03:27:42,0 --> 03:27:42,0
also of beasts

78
03:27:42,0 --> 03:27:42,0
and of the fowls

79
03:27:42,0 --> 03:27:42,0
of the air, I,

80
03:27:42,0 --> 03:27:42,0
the Lord, have

81
03:27:42,0 --> 03:27:42,0
ordained for

82
03:27:42,0 --> 03:27:42,0
the use of man

83
03:27:42,0 --> 03:27:42,0
with

84
03:27:42,0 --> 03:27:42,0
thanksgiving; nevertheless

85
03:27:42,0 --> 03:27:42,0
they are to be

86
03:27:42,0 --> 03:37:45,
used sparingly;

87
03:37:45,0 --> 03:37:45,0
13 And it is

88
03:37:45,0 --> 03:37:45,0
pleasing unto

89
03:37:45,0 --> 03:37:45,0
me that they

90
03:37:45,0 --> 03:37:45,0
should not

91
03:37:45,0 --> 03:37:45,0
be used, only

92
03:37:45,0 --> 03:37:45,0
in times of

93
03:37:45,0 --> 03:37:45,0
winter, or of

94
03:37:45,0 --> 04:00:46,
cold, or famine.

95
04:00:46,0 --> 04:00:46,0
14 All grain

96
04:00:46,0 --> 04:00:46,0
is ordained

97
04:00:46,0 --> 04:00:46,0
for the use

98
04:00:46,0 --> 04:00:46,0
of man and

99
04:00:46,0 --> 04:00:46,0
of beasts,

100
04:00:46,0 --> 04:00:46,0
to be the

101
04:00:46,0 --> 04:00:46,0
staff of life,

102
04:00:46,0 --> 04:00:46,0
not only for

103
04:00:46,0 --> 04:00:46,0
man but for

104
04:00:46,0 --> 04:00:46,0
the beasts

105
04:00:46,0 --> 04:00:46,0
of the

106
04:00:46,0 --> 04:00:46,0
field, and the

107
04:00:46,0 --> 04:00:46,0
fowls of

108
04:00:46,0 --> 04:00:46,0
heaven, and all

109
04:00:46,0 --> 04:00:46,0
wild animals

110
04:00:46,0 --> 04:00:46,0
that run or

111
04:00:46,0 --> 04:07:49,
creep on the earth;

112
04:07:49,0 --> 04:07:49,0
15 And

113
04:07:49,0 --> 04:07:49,0
these hath God

114
04:07:49,0 --> 04:07:49,0
made for

115
04:07:49,0 --> 04:07:49,0
the use of

116
04:07:49,0 --> 04:07:49,0
man only in

117
04:07:49,0 --> 04:07:49,0
times of

118
04:07:49,0 --> 04:07:49,0
famine and

119
04:07:49,0 --> 04:07:27,
excess of hunger.

120
04:07:27,0 --> 04:07:27,0
16 All

121
04:07:27,0 --> 04:07:27,0
grain is good

122
04:07:27,0 --> 04:07:27,0
for the

123
04:07:27,0 --> 04:07:27,0
food of

124
04:07:27,0 --> 04:07:27,0
man; as also

125
04:07:27,0 --> 04:07:27,0
the fruit

126
04:07:27,0 --> 04:07:27,0
of the

127
04:07:27,0 --> 04:07:27,0
vine; that

128
04:07:27,0 --> 04:07:27,0
which

129
04:07:27,0 --> 04:07:27,0
yieldeth fruit,

130
04:07:27,0 --> 04:07:27,0
whether in

131
04:07:27,0 --> 04:07:27,0
the

132
04:07:27,0 --> 04:03:07,
ground or above the ground—

133
04:03:07,0 --> 04:03:07,0
17

134
04:03:07,0 --> 04:03:07,0
Nevertheless,

135
04:03:07,0 --> 04:03:07,0
wheat for

136
04:03:07,0 --> 04:03:07,0

138
04:03:07,0 --> 04:03:07,0
the ox,

139
04:03:07,0 --> 04:03:07,0

140

the fowls

144

04:03:07,0 --> 04:03:07,0
for all

147
04:03:07,0 --> 04:03:07,0
beasts of

148
04:03:07,0 --> 04:03:07,0
the

149
04:03:07,0 --> 04:03:07,0

all

152
04:03:07,0 --> 04:03:07,0
useful

153
04:03:07,0 --> 04:03:07,0
animals, and for

154
04:03:07,0 --> 04:03:07,0
mild

155
04:03:07,0 --> 04:07:14,

156
04:07:14,0 --> 04:07:14,0
18 And

04:07:14,0 --> 04:07:14,0
all

158
04:07:14,0 --> 04:07:14,0
saints who

159
04:07:14,0 --> 04:07:14,0

04:07:14,0 --> 04:07:14,0
to keep

161

162
04:07:14,0 --> 04:07:14,0
these

163
04:07:14,0 --> 04:07:14,0

164
04:07:14,0 --> 04:07:14,0
walking in

166
04:07:14,0 --> 04:07:14,0
obedience to the
