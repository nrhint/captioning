00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 137 A vision given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Prophet, in the temple at Kirtland, Ohio, January

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
21, 1836. The occasion was the administration

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of ordinances in preparation for the dedication

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of the temple. 
1–6, The Prophet sees his brother

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Alvin in the celestial kingdom; 
7–9, The

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
doctrine of salvation for the dead is revealed; 
10,

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:57:57,
All children are saved in the celestial kingdom. 

9
00:57:57,0 --> 00:57:57,0
1 The heavens were opened upon us, and I beheld

10
00:57:57,0 --> 00:57:57,0
the celestial kingdom of God, and the glory

11
00:57:57,0 --> 01:03:01,
thereof, whether in the body or out I cannot tell.

12
01:03:01,0 --> 01:03:01,0
2 I saw the transcendent beauty of the gate

13
01:03:01,0 --> 01:03:01,0
through which the heirs of that kingdom will

14
01:03:01,0 --> 01:18:03,
enter, which was like unto circling flames of fire;

15
01:18:03,0 --> 01:18:03,0
3 Also the blazing throne of God,

16
01:18:03,0 --> 01:37:39,
whereon was seated the Father and the Son.

17
01:37:39,0 --> 01:37:39,0
4 I saw the beautiful streets of

18
01:37:39,0 --> 01:37:39,0
that kingdom, which had the

19
01:37:39,0 --> 01:33:19,
appearance of being paved with gold.

20
01:33:19,0 --> 01:33:19,0
5 I saw Father Adam and

21
01:33:19,0 --> 01:33:19,0
Abraham; and my father and

22
01:33:19,0 --> 01:33:19,0
my mother; my brother

23
01:33:19,0 --> 01:44:20,
Alvin, that has long since slept;

24
01:44:20,0 --> 01:44:20,0
6 And marveled how it

25
01:44:20,0 --> 01:44:20,0
was that he had obtained

26
01:44:20,0 --> 01:44:20,0
an inheritance in that

27
01:44:20,0 --> 01:44:20,0
kingdom, seeing that

28
01:44:20,0 --> 01:44:20,0
he had departed this

29
01:44:20,0 --> 01:44:20,0
life before the Lord had

30
01:44:20,0 --> 01:44:20,0
set his hand to gather

31
01:44:20,0 --> 01:44:20,0
Israel the second time,

32
01:44:20,0 --> 01:44:20,0
and had not been

33
01:44:20,0 --> 01:57:24,
baptized for the remission of sins.

34
01:57:24,0 --> 01:57:24,0
7 Thus came the voice

35
01:57:24,0 --> 01:57:24,0
of the Lord unto me,

36
01:57:24,0 --> 01:57:24,0
saying: All who have

37
01:57:24,0 --> 01:57:24,0
died without a

38
01:57:24,0 --> 01:57:24,0
knowledge of this gospel,

39
01:57:24,0 --> 01:57:24,0
who would have

40
01:57:24,0 --> 01:57:24,0
received it if they had

41
01:57:24,0 --> 01:57:24,0
been permitted to tarry,

42
01:57:24,0 --> 01:57:24,0
shall be heirs of

43
01:57:24,0 --> 02:11:58,
the celestial kingdom of God;

44
02:11:58,0 --> 02:11:58,0
8 Also all that

45
02:11:58,0 --> 02:11:58,0
shall die henceforth

46
02:11:58,0 --> 02:11:58,0
without a knowledge of

47
02:11:58,0 --> 02:11:58,0
it, who would have

48
02:11:58,0 --> 02:11:58,0
received it with all

49
02:11:58,0 --> 02:11:58,0
their hearts, shall

50
02:11:58,0 --> 02:31:35,
be heirs of that kingdom;

51
02:31:35,0 --> 02:31:35,0
9 For I, the

52
02:31:35,0 --> 02:31:35,0
Lord, will judge all

53
02:31:35,0 --> 02:31:35,0
men according to

54
02:31:35,0 --> 02:31:35,0
their works,

55
02:31:35,0 --> 02:31:35,0
according to the

56
02:31:35,0 --> 02:46:36,
desire of their hearts.

57
02:46:36,0 --> 02:46:36,0
10 And I also

58
02:46:36,0 --> 02:46:36,0
beheld that all

59
02:46:36,0 --> 02:46:36,0
children who

60
02:46:36,0 --> 02:46:36,0
die before they

61
02:46:36,0 --> 02:46:36,0
arrive at the

62
02:46:36,0 --> 02:46:36,0
years of

63
02:46:36,0 --> 02:46:36,0
accountability are

64
02:46:36,0 --> 02:46:36,0
saved in the

65
02:46:36,0 --> 02:51:41,
celestial kingdom of heaven.
