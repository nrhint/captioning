00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:17,403
Section 137 A vision given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:17,403 --> 00:00:23,528
 Prophet, in the temple at Kirtland, Ohio, January 21,

3
00:00:23,528 --> 00:00:29,653
 1836. The occasion was the administration of

4
00:00:29,653 --> 00:00:35,778
 ordinances in preparation for the dedication of the

5
00:00:35,778 --> 00:00:41,903
 temple. 
1–6, The Prophet sees his brother Alvin in

6
00:00:41,903 --> 00:00:48,028
 the celestial kingdom; 
7–9, The doctrine of

7
00:00:48,028 --> 00:00:54,153
 salvation for the dead is revealed; 
10, All children

8
00:00:54,153 --> 00:01:00,278
 are saved in the celestial kingdom.

9
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:06,978
1 The heavens were opened upon us, and I beheld

10
00:01:06,978 --> 00:01:12,978
 the celestial kingdom of God, and the glory thereof,

11
00:01:12,978 --> 00:01:18,978
 whether in the body or out I cannot tell

12
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:23,495
2 I saw the transcendent beauty of the gate

13
00:01:23,495 --> 00:01:28,495
 through which the heirs of that kingdom will enter,

14
00:01:28,495 --> 00:01:33,495
 which was like unto circling flames of fire

15
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:39,027
3 Also the blazing throne of God, whereon was

16
00:01:39,027 --> 00:01:44,527
 seated the Father and the Son

17
00:01:44,821 --> 00:01:52,321
4 I saw the beautiful streets of that kingdom,

18
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:59,821
 which had the appearance of being paved with gold

19
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:06,786
5 I saw Father Adam and Abraham; and my father and

20
00:02:06,786 --> 00:02:14,453
 my mother; my brother Alvin, that has long since

21
00:02:14,453 --> 00:02:22,12
 slept

22
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:24,176
6 And marveled how it was that he had obtained an

23
00:02:24,176 --> 00:02:25,976
 inheritance in that kingdom, seeing that he had

24
00:02:25,976 --> 00:02:27,776
 departed this life before the Lord had set his hand

25
00:02:27,776 --> 00:02:29,576
 to gather Israel the second time, and had not been

26
00:02:29,576 --> 00:02:31,376
 baptized for the remission of sins

27
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:36,302
7 Thus came the voice of the Lord unto me, saying:

28
00:02:36,302 --> 00:02:40,702
 All who have died without a knowledge of this

29
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:45,102
 gospel, who would have received it if they had been

30
00:02:45,102 --> 00:02:49,502
 permitted to tarry, shall be heirs of the celestial

31
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:53,902
 kingdom of God

32
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:57,84
8 Also all that shall die henceforth without a

33
00:02:57,84 --> 00:03:02,507
 knowledge of it, who would have received it with all

34
00:03:02,507 --> 00:03:07,174
 their hearts, shall be heirs of that kingdom

35
00:03:07,22 --> 00:03:10,22
9 For I, the Lord, will judge all men according to

36
00:03:10,22 --> 00:03:13,22
 their works, according to the desire of their

37
00:03:13,22 --> 00:03:16,22
 hearts

38
00:03:16,78 --> 00:03:22,113
10 And I also beheld that all children who die

39
00:03:22,113 --> 00:03:27,446
 before they arrive at the years of accountability are

40
00:03:27,446 --> 00:03:32,779
 saved in the celestial kingdom of heaven.
