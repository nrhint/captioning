1
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:17,742
Section 49 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:17,742 --> 00:00:24,206
 the Prophet to Sidney Rigdon, Parley P. Pratt, and

3
00:00:24,206 --> 00:00:30,67
 Leman Copley, at Kirtland, Ohio, May 7, 1831.

4
00:00:30,67 --> 00:00:37,134
 Leman Copley had embraced the gospel but still held to

5
00:00:37,134 --> 00:00:43,598
 some of the teachings of the Shakers (United

6
00:00:43,598 --> 00:00:50,062
 Society of Believers in Christ’s Second Appearing), to

7
00:00:50,062 --> 00:00:56,526
 which he had formerly belonged. Some of the

8
00:00:56,526 --> 00:01:02,99
 beliefs of the Shakers were that Christ’s Second Coming

9
00:01:02,99 --> 00:01:09,454
 had already occurred and that He had appeared in

10
00:01:09,454 --> 00:01:15,918
 the form of a woman, Ann Lee. They did not

11
00:01:15,918 --> 00:01:22,382
 consider baptism by water essential. They rejected

12
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:28,846
 marriage and believed in a life of total celibacy. Some

13
00:01:28,846 --> 00:01:35,31
 Shakers also forbade the eating of meat. In

14
00:01:35,31 --> 00:01:41,774
 prefacing this revelation, Joseph Smith’s history

15
00:01:41,774 --> 00:01:48,238
 states, “In order to have [a] more perfect understanding

16
00:01:48,238 --> 00:01:54,702
 on the subject, I inquired of the Lord, and

17
00:01:54,702 --> 00:02:01,166
 received the following.” The revelation refutes some of

18
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:07,63
 the basic concepts of the Shaker group. The

19
00:02:07,63 --> 00:02:14,094
 aforementioned brethren took a copy of the revelation

20
00:02:14,094 --> 00:02:20,558
 to the Shaker community (near Cleveland, Ohio) and

21
00:02:20,558 --> 00:02:27,022
 read it to them in its entirety, but it was

22
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:33,486
 rejected. 
1–7, The day and hour of Christ’s coming will

23
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:39,95
 remain unknown until He comes; 
8–14, Men must

24
00:02:39,95 --> 00:02:46,414
 repent, believe the gospel, and obey the ordinances

25
00:02:46,414 --> 00:02:52,878
 to gain salvation; 
15–16, Marriage is ordained of

26
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:59,342
 God; 
17–21, The eating of meat is approved;

27
00:02:59,342 --> 00:03:05,806
22–28, Zion will flourish and the Lamanites blossom

28
00:03:05,806 --> 00:03:12,27
 as the rose before the Second Coming.

29
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:18,026
1 Hearken unto my word, my servants Sidney, and

30
00:03:18,026 --> 00:03:23,226
 Parley, and Leman; for behold, verily I say unto

31
00:03:23,226 --> 00:03:28,426
 you, that I give unto you a commandment that you

32
00:03:28,426 --> 00:03:33,626
 shall go and preach my gospel which ye have received,

33
00:03:33,626 --> 00:03:38,826
 even as ye have received it, unto the Shakers

34
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:43,018
2 Behold, I say unto you, that they desire to know

35
00:03:43,018 --> 00:03:47,685
 the truth in part, but not all, for they are not

36
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:52,352
 right before me and must needs repent

37
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:57,866
3 Wherefore, I send you, my servants Sidney and

38
00:03:57,866 --> 00:04:02,866
 Parley, to preach the gospel unto them

39
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,326
4 And my servant Leman shall be ordained unto this

40
00:04:07,326 --> 00:04:12,493
 work, that he may reason with them, not according

41
00:04:12,493 --> 00:04:17,66
 to that which he has received of them, but

42
00:04:17,66 --> 00:04:22,827
 according to that which shall be taught him by you my

43
00:04:22,827 --> 00:04:27,994
 servants; and by so doing I will bless him,

44
00:04:27,994 --> 00:04:33,161
 otherwise he shall not prosper

45
00:04:33,14 --> 00:04:38,14
5 Thus saith the Lord; for I am God, and have sent

46
00:04:38,14 --> 00:04:43,14
 mine Only Begotten Son into the world for the

47
00:04:43,14 --> 00:04:48,14
 redemption of the world, and have decreed that he

48
00:04:48,14 --> 00:04:53,14
 that receiveth him shall be saved, and he that

49
00:04:53,14 --> 00:04:58,14
 receiveth him not shall be damned

50
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:03,431
6 And they have done unto the Son of Man even as

51
00:05:03,431 --> 00:05:08,431
 they listed; and he has taken his power on the

52
00:05:08,431 --> 00:05:13,431
 right hand of his glory, and now reigneth in the

53
00:05:13,431 --> 00:05:18,431
 heavens, and will reign till he descends on the earth

54
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:23,431
 to put all enemies under his feet, which time is

55
00:05:23,431 --> 00:05:28,431
 nigh at hand

56
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:36,929
7 I, the Lord God, have spoken it; but the hour

57
00:05:36,929 --> 00:05:44,929
 and the day no man knoweth, neither the angels in

58
00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:52,929
 heaven, nor shall they know until he comes

59
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:59,086
8 Wherefore, I will that all men shall repent, for

60
00:05:59,086 --> 00:06:05,753
 all are under sin, except those which I have

61
00:06:05,753 --> 00:06:12,42
 reserved unto myself, holy men that ye know not of

62
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:16,172
9 Wherefore, I say unto you that I have sent unto

63
00:06:16,172 --> 00:06:20,172
 you mine everlasting covenant, even that which was

64
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:24,172
 from the beginning

65
00:06:24,701 --> 00:06:29,901
10 And that which I have promised I have so

66
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:35,101
 fulfilled, and the nations of the earth shall bow to it;

67
00:06:35,101 --> 00:06:40,301
 and, if not of themselves, they shall come down,

68
00:06:40,301 --> 00:06:45,501
 for that which is now exalted of itself shall be

69
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:50,701
 laid low of power

70
00:06:50,21 --> 00:06:56,21
11 Wherefore, I give unto you a commandment that

71
00:06:56,21 --> 00:07:02,21
 ye go among this people, and say unto them, like

72
00:07:02,21 --> 00:07:08,21
 unto mine apostle of old, whose name was Peter

73
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:11,878
12 Believe on the name of the Lord Jesus, who was

74
00:07:11,878 --> 00:07:15,545
 on the earth, and is to come, the beginning and

75
00:07:15,545 --> 00:07:19,212
 the end

76
00:07:19,222 --> 00:07:22,222
13 Repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus

77
00:07:22,222 --> 00:07:25,222
 Christ, according to the holy commandment, for the

78
00:07:25,222 --> 00:07:28,222
 remission of sins

79
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:33,748
14 And whoso doeth this shall receive the gift of

80
00:07:33,748 --> 00:07:38,748
 the Holy Ghost, by the laying on of the hands of

81
00:07:38,748 --> 00:07:43,748
 the elders of the church

82
00:07:43,747 --> 00:07:49,747
15 And again, verily I say unto you, that whoso

83
00:07:49,747 --> 00:07:55,747
 forbiddeth to marry is not ordained of God, for

84
00:07:55,747 --> 00:08:01,747
 marriage is ordained of God unto man

85
00:08:01,264 --> 00:08:06,014
16 Wherefore, it is lawful that he should have one

86
00:08:06,014 --> 00:08:10,764
 wife, and they twain shall be one flesh, and all

87
00:08:10,764 --> 00:08:15,514
 this that the earth might answer the end of its

88
00:08:15,514 --> 00:08:20,264
 creation

89
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:25,2
17 And that it might be filled with the measure of

90
00:08:25,2 --> 00:08:29,867
 man, according to his creation before the world

91
00:08:29,867 --> 00:08:34,534
 was made

92
00:08:34,531 --> 00:08:38,531
18 And whoso forbiddeth to abstain from meats,

93
00:08:38,531 --> 00:08:42,531
 that man should not eat the same, is not ordained of

94
00:08:42,531 --> 00:08:46,531
 God

95
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:52,026
19 For, behold, the beasts of the field and the

96
00:08:52,026 --> 00:08:57,526
 fowls of the air, and that which cometh of the

97
00:08:57,526 --> 00:09:03,026
 earth, is ordained for the use of man for food and for

98
00:09:03,026 --> 00:09:08,526
 raiment, and that he might have in abundance

99
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:13,465
20 But it is not given that one man should possess

100
00:09:13,465 --> 00:09:18,132
 that which is above another, wherefore the world

101
00:09:18,132 --> 00:09:22,799
 lieth in sin

102
00:09:22,078 --> 00:09:28,578
21 And wo be unto man that sheddeth blood or that

103
00:09:28,578 --> 00:09:35,078
 wasteth flesh and hath no need

104
00:09:35,091 --> 00:09:39,758
22 And again, verily I say unto you, that the Son

105
00:09:39,758 --> 00:09:44,425
 of Man cometh not in the form of a woman, neither

106
00:09:44,425 --> 00:09:49,092
 of a man traveling on the earth

107
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:56,175
23 Wherefore, be not deceived, but continue in

108
00:09:56,175 --> 00:10:02,461
 steadfastness, looking forth for the heavens to be

109
00:10:02,461 --> 00:10:08,747
 shaken, and the earth to tremble and to reel to and

110
00:10:08,747 --> 00:10:15,033
 fro as a drunken man, and for the valleys to be

111
00:10:15,033 --> 00:10:21,319
 exalted, and for the mountains to be made low, and

112
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:27,605
 for the rough places to become smooth—and all this

113
00:10:27,605 --> 00:10:33,891
 when the angel shall sound his trumpet

114
00:10:33,85 --> 00:10:40,517
24 But before the great day of the Lord shall

115
00:10:40,517 --> 00:10:47,184
 come, Jacob shall flourish in the wilderness, and the

116
00:10:47,184 --> 00:10:53,851
 Lamanites shall blossom as the rose

117
00:10:53,837 --> 00:11:00,504
25 Zion shall flourish upon the hills and rejoice

118
00:11:00,504 --> 00:11:07,171
 upon the mountains, and shall be assembled

119
00:11:07,171 --> 00:11:13,838
 together unto the place which I have appointed

120
00:11:13,823 --> 00:11:19,073
26 Behold, I say unto you, go forth as I have

121
00:11:19,073 --> 00:11:24,323
 commanded you; repent of all your sins; ask and ye

122
00:11:24,323 --> 00:11:29,573
 shall receive; knock and it shall be opened unto you

123
00:11:29,573 --> 00:11:34,823


124
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:40,494
27 Behold, I will go before you and be your

125
00:11:40,494 --> 00:11:46,161
 rearward; and I will be in your midst, and you shall not

126
00:11:46,161 --> 00:11:51,828
 be confounded

127
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:56,844
28 Behold, I am Jesus Christ, and I come quickly.

128
00:11:56,844 --> 00:12:01,844
 Even so. Amen.
