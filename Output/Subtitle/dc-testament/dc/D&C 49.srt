00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:01,643
Section 49 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:01,643 --> 00:00:03,286
the Prophet to Sidney Rigdon, Parley P. Pratt,

3
00:00:03,286 --> 00:00:04,929
and Leman Copley, at Kirtland, Ohio, May 7, 1831.

4
00:00:04,929 --> 00:00:06,572
Leman Copley had embraced the gospel but still

5
00:00:06,572 --> 00:00:08,215
held to some of the teachings of the Shakers (United

6
00:00:08,215 --> 00:00:09,858
Society of Believers in Christ’s Second

7
00:00:09,858 --> 00:00:11,501
Appearing), to which he had formerly belonged. Some of

8
00:00:11,501 --> 00:00:13,144
the beliefs of the Shakers were that Christ’s

9
00:00:13,144 --> 00:00:14,787
Second Coming had already occurred and that He had

10
00:00:14,787 --> 00:00:16,43
appeared in the form of a woman, Ann Lee. They did

11
00:00:16,43 --> 00:00:18,073
not consider baptism by water essential. They

12
00:00:18,073 --> 00:00:19,716
rejected marriage and believed in a life of total

13
00:00:19,716 --> 00:00:21,359
celibacy. Some Shakers also forbade the eating of

14
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,002
meat. In prefacing this revelation, Joseph Smith’s

15
00:00:23,002 --> 00:00:24,645
history states, “In order to have [a] more

16
00:00:24,645 --> 00:00:26,288
perfect understanding on the subject, I inquired of the

17
00:00:26,288 --> 00:00:27,931
Lord, and received the following.” The

18
00:00:27,931 --> 00:00:29,574
revelation refutes some of the basic concepts of the

19
00:00:29,574 --> 00:00:31,217
Shaker group. The aforementioned brethren took a copy

20
00:00:31,217 --> 00:00:32,86
of the revelation to the Shaker community (near

21
00:00:32,86 --> 00:00:34,503
Cleveland, Ohio) and read it to them in its

22
00:00:34,503 --> 00:00:36,146
entirety, but it was rejected. 
1–7, The day and hour

23
00:00:36,146 --> 00:00:37,789
of Christ’s coming will remain unknown until He

24
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:39,432
comes; 
8–14, Men must repent, believe the gospel,

25
00:00:39,432 --> 00:00:41,075
and obey the ordinances to gain salvation;

26
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:42,718
15–16, Marriage is ordained of God; 
17–21, The eating

27
00:00:42,718 --> 00:00:44,361
of meat is approved; 
22–28, Zion will flourish

28
00:00:44,361 --> 00:00:46,547
and the Lamanites blossom as the rose before the Second Coming. 

29
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:45,88
1 Hearken unto my word, my servants

30
00:00:45,88 --> 00:00:45,212
Sidney, and Parley, and Leman; for behold,

31
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:44,546
verily I say unto you, that I give unto you

32
00:00:44,546 --> 00:00:43,879
a commandment that you shall go and

33
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:43,212
preach my gospel which ye have received, even

34
00:00:43,212 --> 00:00:42,209
as ye have received it, unto the Shakers.

35
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:46,959
2 Behold, I say unto you, that

36
00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:51,709
they desire to know the truth in

37
00:00:51,709 --> 00:00:56,459
part, but not all, for they are not

38
00:00:56,459 --> 00:01:01,211
right before me and must needs repent.

39
00:01:01,211 --> 00:00:59,544
3 Wherefore, I send you, my

40
00:00:59,544 --> 00:00:57,877
servants Sidney and Parley, to

41
00:00:57,877 --> 00:00:56,873
preach the gospel unto them.

42
00:00:56,873 --> 00:00:59,473
4 And my servant Leman

43
00:00:59,473 --> 00:01:02,073
shall be ordained unto this

44
00:01:02,073 --> 00:01:04,673
work, that he may reason with

45
00:01:04,673 --> 00:01:07,273
them, not according to that

46
00:01:07,273 --> 00:01:09,873
which he has received of

47
00:01:09,873 --> 00:01:12,473
them, but according to that

48
00:01:12,473 --> 00:01:15,073
which shall be taught him

49
00:01:15,073 --> 00:01:17,673
by you my servants; and by

50
00:01:17,673 --> 00:01:20,273
so doing I will bless him,

51
00:01:20,273 --> 00:01:22,899
otherwise he shall not prosper.

52
00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:22,455
5 Thus saith the Lord;

53
00:01:22,455 --> 00:01:22,011
for I am God, and have sent

54
00:01:22,011 --> 00:01:21,567
mine Only Begotten Son

55
00:01:21,567 --> 00:01:21,123
into the world for the

56
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:20,679
redemption of the world, and

57
00:01:20,679 --> 00:01:20,235
have decreed that he

58
00:01:20,235 --> 00:01:19,791
that receiveth him shall be

59
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:19,347
saved, and he that

60
00:01:19,347 --> 00:01:18,562
receiveth him not shall be damned—

61
00:01:18,562 --> 00:01:21,653
6 And they have done

62
00:01:21,653 --> 00:01:24,744
unto the Son of Man even

63
00:01:24,744 --> 00:01:27,835
as they listed; and he

64
00:01:27,835 --> 00:01:30,926
has taken his power on

65
00:01:30,926 --> 00:01:34,017
the right hand of his

66
00:01:34,017 --> 00:01:37,108
glory, and now reigneth

67
00:01:37,108 --> 00:01:40,199
in the heavens, and

68
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:43,29
will reign till he

69
00:01:43,29 --> 00:01:46,381
descends on the earth to put

70
00:01:46,381 --> 00:01:49,472
all enemies under his

71
00:01:49,472 --> 00:01:52,579
feet, which time is nigh at hand—

72
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:57,293
7 I, the Lord God,

73
00:01:57,293 --> 00:02:02,007
have spoken it; but

74
00:02:02,007 --> 00:02:06,721
the hour and the day

75
00:02:06,721 --> 00:02:11,435
no man knoweth,

76
00:02:11,435 --> 00:02:16,149
neither the angels in

77
00:02:16,149 --> 00:02:20,863
heaven, nor shall they

78
00:02:20,863 --> 00:02:25,595
know until he comes.

79
00:02:25,595 --> 00:02:31,47
8 Wherefore, I

80
00:02:31,47 --> 00:02:37,345
will that all men

81
00:02:37,345 --> 00:02:43,22
shall repent, for all

82
00:02:43,22 --> 00:02:49,095
are under sin,

83
00:02:49,095 --> 00:02:54,97
except those which I

84
00:02:54,97 --> 00:03:00,845
have reserved

85
00:03:00,845 --> 00:03:06,72
unto myself, holy men

86
00:03:06,72 --> 00:03:12,142
that ye know not of.

87
00:03:12,142 --> 00:03:15,713
9 Wherefore, I

88
00:03:15,713 --> 00:03:19,284
say unto you that I

89
00:03:19,284 --> 00:03:22,855
have sent unto

90
00:03:22,855 --> 00:03:26,426
you mine

91
00:03:26,426 --> 00:03:29,997
everlasting covenant, even

92
00:03:29,997 --> 00:03:33,568
that which was

93
00:03:33,568 --> 00:03:37,184
from the beginning.

94
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:38,184
10 And that

95
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:39,184
which I have

96
00:03:39,184 --> 00:03:40,184
promised I have so

97
00:03:40,184 --> 00:03:41,184
fulfilled, and the

98
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,184
nations of the

99
00:03:42,184 --> 00:03:43,184
earth shall bow to

100
00:03:43,184 --> 00:03:44,184
it; and, if not

101
00:03:44,184 --> 00:03:45,184
of themselves,

102
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:46,184
they shall come

103
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,184
down, for that

104
00:03:47,184 --> 00:03:48,184
which is now

105
00:03:48,184 --> 00:03:49,184
exalted of itself

106
00:03:49,184 --> 00:03:50,263
shall be laid low of power.

107
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:49,763
11 Wherefore,

108
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:49,263
I give unto

109
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:48,763
you a

110
00:03:48,763 --> 00:03:48,263
commandment that ye go

111
00:03:48,263 --> 00:03:47,763
among this

112
00:03:47,763 --> 00:03:47,263
people, and say

113
00:03:47,263 --> 00:03:46,763
unto them, like

114
00:03:46,763 --> 00:03:46,263
unto mine

115
00:03:46,263 --> 00:03:45,763
apostle of old,

116
00:03:45,763 --> 00:03:45,926
whose name was Peter:

117
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:46,676
12 Believe on

118
00:03:46,676 --> 00:03:47,426
the name of

119
00:03:47,426 --> 00:03:48,176
the Lord

120
00:03:48,176 --> 00:03:48,926
Jesus, who was on

121
00:03:48,926 --> 00:03:49,676
the earth,

122
00:03:49,676 --> 00:03:50,426
and is to

123
00:03:50,426 --> 00:03:51,176
come, the

124
00:03:51,176 --> 00:03:51,548
beginning and the end;

125
00:03:51,548 --> 00:03:52,326
13 Repent

126
00:03:52,326 --> 00:03:53,104
and be

127
00:03:53,104 --> 00:03:53,882
baptized in the

128
00:03:53,882 --> 00:03:54,66
name of Jesus

129
00:03:54,66 --> 00:03:55,438
Christ,

130
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:56,216
according to the

131
00:03:56,216 --> 00:03:56,994
holy

132
00:03:56,994 --> 00:03:57,772
commandment, for

133
00:03:57,772 --> 00:03:58,588
the remission of sins;

134
00:03:58,588 --> 00:03:58,679
14 And

135
00:03:58,679 --> 00:03:58,77
whoso doeth

136
00:03:58,77 --> 00:03:58,861
this shall

137
00:03:58,861 --> 00:03:58,952
receive the

138
00:03:58,952 --> 00:03:59,043
gift of the

139
00:03:59,043 --> 00:03:59,134
Holy Ghost,

140
00:03:59,134 --> 00:03:59,225
by the

141
00:03:59,225 --> 00:03:59,316
laying on of

142
00:03:59,316 --> 00:03:59,407
the hands of

143
00:03:59,407 --> 00:03:59,498
the elders

144
00:03:59,498 --> 00:03:59,656
of the church.

145
00:03:59,656 --> 00:03:59,348
15 And

146
00:03:59,348 --> 00:03:59,04
again, verily

147
00:03:59,04 --> 00:03:58,732
I say

148
00:03:58,732 --> 00:03:58,424
unto you,

149
00:03:58,424 --> 00:03:58,116
that whoso

150
00:03:58,116 --> 00:03:57,808
forbiddeth

151
00:03:57,808 --> 00:03:57,5
to marry is

152
00:03:57,5 --> 00:03:57,192
not

153
00:03:57,192 --> 00:03:56,884
ordained of

154
00:03:56,884 --> 00:03:56,576
God, for

155
00:03:56,576 --> 00:03:56,268
marriage is

156
00:03:56,268 --> 00:03:55,96
ordained of

157
00:03:55,96 --> 00:03:55,318
God unto man.

158
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:55,506
16

159
00:03:55,506 --> 00:03:55,694
Wherefore, it

160
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:55,882
is lawful

161
00:03:55,882 --> 00:03:56,07
that he

162
00:03:56,07 --> 00:03:56,258
should

163
00:03:56,258 --> 00:03:56,446
have one

164
00:03:56,446 --> 00:03:56,634
wife, and

165
00:03:56,634 --> 00:03:56,822
they twain

166
00:03:56,822 --> 00:03:57,01
shall be

167
00:03:57,01 --> 00:03:57,198
one

168
00:03:57,198 --> 00:03:57,386
flesh, and all

169
00:03:57,386 --> 00:03:57,574
this

170
00:03:57,574 --> 00:03:57,762
that the

171
00:03:57,762 --> 00:03:57,95
earth might

172
00:03:57,95 --> 00:03:58,138
answer

173
00:03:58,138 --> 00:03:58,972
the end of its creation;

174
00:03:58,972 --> 00:03:58,639
17 And

175
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:58,306
that it

176
00:03:58,306 --> 00:03:57,973
might be

177
00:03:57,973 --> 00:03:57,64
filled with

178
00:03:57,64 --> 00:03:57,307
the

179
00:03:57,307 --> 00:03:56,974
measure of

180
00:03:56,974 --> 00:03:56,641
man,

181
00:03:56,641 --> 00:03:56,308
according to his

182
00:03:56,308 --> 00:03:55,975
creation

183
00:03:55,975 --> 00:03:55,642
before

184
00:03:55,642 --> 00:03:55,309
the world

185
00:03:55,309 --> 00:03:54,634
was made.

186
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:54,967
18 And

187
00:03:54,967 --> 00:03:55,3
whoso

188
00:03:55,3 --> 00:03:55,633
forbiddeth

189
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:55,966
to

190
00:03:55,966 --> 00:03:56,299
abstain from

191
00:03:56,299 --> 00:03:56,632
meats,

192
00:03:56,632 --> 00:03:56,965
that man

193
00:03:56,965 --> 00:03:57,298
should

194
00:03:57,298 --> 00:03:57,631
not eat

195
00:03:57,631 --> 00:03:57,964
the same,

196
00:03:57,964 --> 00:03:58,297
is not

197
00:03:58,297 --> 00:03:58,755

00:03:57,543 --> 00:03:57,605
I

650
