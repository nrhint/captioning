1
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 49 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Prophet to Sidney Rigdon, Parley P. Pratt,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and Leman Copley, at Kirtland, Ohio, May 7, 1831.

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Leman Copley had embraced the gospel but still

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
held to some of the teachings of the Shakers (United

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Society of Believers in Christ’s Second

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Appearing), to which he had formerly belonged. Some of

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the beliefs of the Shakers were that Christ’s

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Second Coming had already occurred and that He had

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
appeared in the form of a woman, Ann Lee. They did

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
not consider baptism by water essential. They

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
rejected marriage and believed in a life of total

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
celibacy. Some Shakers also forbade the eating of

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
meat. In prefacing this revelation, Joseph Smith’s

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
history states, “In order to have [a] more

16
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
perfect understanding on the subject, I inquired of the

17
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Lord, and received the following.” The

18
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
revelation refutes some of the basic concepts of the

19
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Shaker group. The aforementioned brethren took a copy

20
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of the revelation to the Shaker community (near

21
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Cleveland, Ohio) and read it to them in its

22
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
entirety, but it was rejected. 
1–7, The day and hour

23
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of Christ’s coming will remain unknown until He

24
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
comes; 
8–14, Men must repent, believe the gospel,

25
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and obey the ordinances to gain salvation;

26
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
15–16, Marriage is ordained of God; 
17–21, The eating

27
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of meat is approved; 
22–28, Zion will flourish

28
00:00:00,0 --> 03:10:40,
and the Lamanites blossom as the rose before the Second Coming. 

29
03:10:40,0 --> 03:10:40,0
1 Hearken unto my word, my servants

30
03:10:40,0 --> 03:10:40,0
Sidney, and Parley, and Leman; for behold,

31
03:10:40,0 --> 03:10:40,0
verily I say unto you, that I give unto you

32
03:10:40,0 --> 03:10:40,0
a commandment that you shall go and

33
03:10:40,0 --> 03:10:40,0
preach my gospel which ye have received, even

34
03:10:40,0 --> 03:11:44,
as ye have received it, unto the Shakers.

35
03:11:44,0 --> 03:11:44,0
2 Behold, I say unto you, that

36
03:11:44,0 --> 03:11:44,0
they desire to know the truth in

37
03:11:44,0 --> 03:11:44,0
part, but not all, for they are not

38
03:11:44,0 --> 03:34:45,
right before me and must needs repent.

39
03:34:45,0 --> 03:34:45,0
3 Wherefore, I send you, my

40
03:34:45,0 --> 03:34:45,0
servants Sidney and Parley, to

41
03:34:45,0 --> 03:38:24,
preach the gospel unto them.

42
03:38:24,0 --> 03:38:24,0
4 And my servant Leman

43
03:38:24,0 --> 03:38:24,0
shall be ordained unto this

44
03:38:24,0 --> 03:38:24,0
work, that he may reason with

45
03:38:24,0 --> 03:38:24,0
them, not according to that

46
03:38:24,0 --> 03:38:24,0
which he has received of

47
03:38:24,0 --> 03:38:24,0
them, but according to that

48
03:38:24,0 --> 03:38:24,0
which shall be taught him

49
03:38:24,0 --> 03:38:24,0
by you my servants; and by

50
03:38:24,0 --> 03:38:24,0
so doing I will bless him,

51
03:38:24,0 --> 03:51:28,
otherwise he shall not prosper.

52
03:51:28,0 --> 03:51:28,0
5 Thus saith the Lord;

53
03:51:28,0 --> 03:51:28,0
for I am God, and have sent

54
03:51:28,0 --> 03:51:28,0
mine Only Begotten Son

55
03:51:28,0 --> 03:51:28,0
into the world for the

56
03:51:28,0 --> 03:51:28,0
redemption of the world, and

57
03:51:28,0 --> 03:51:28,0
have decreed that he

58
03:51:28,0 --> 03:51:28,0
that receiveth him shall be

59
03:51:28,0 --> 03:51:28,0
saved, and he that

60
03:51:28,0 --> 04:00:31,
receiveth him not shall be damned—

61
04:00:31,0 --> 04:00:31,0
6 And they have done

62
04:00:31,0 --> 04:00:31,0
unto the Son of Man even

63
04:00:31,0 --> 04:00:31,0
as they listed; and he

64
04:00:31,0 --> 04:00:31,0
has taken his power on

65
04:00:31,0 --> 04:00:31,0
the right hand of his

66
04:00:31,0 --> 04:00:31,0
glory, and now reigneth

67
04:00:31,0 --> 04:00:31,0
in the heavens, and

68
04:00:31,0 --> 04:00:31,0
will reign till he

69
04:00:31,0 --> 04:00:31,0
descends on the earth to put

70
04:00:31,0 --> 04:00:31,0
all enemies under his

71
04:00:31,0 --> 04:31:31,
feet, which time is nigh at hand—

72
04:31:31,0 --> 04:31:31,0
7 I, the Lord God,

73
04:31:31,0 --> 04:31:31,0
have spoken it; but

74
04:31:31,0 --> 04:31:31,0
the hour and the day

75
04:31:31,0 --> 04:31:31,0
no man knoweth,

76
04:31:31,0 --> 04:31:31,0
neither the angels in

77
04:31:31,0 --> 04:31:31,0
heaven, nor shall they

78
04:31:31,0 --> 04:55:34,
know until he comes.

79
04:55:34,0 --> 04:55:34,0
8 Wherefore, I

80
04:55:34,0 --> 04:55:34,0
will that all men

81
04:55:34,0 --> 04:55:34,0
shall repent, for all

82
04:55:34,0 --> 04:55:34,0
are under sin,

83
04:55:34,0 --> 04:55:34,0
except those which I

84
04:55:34,0 --> 04:55:34,0
have reserved

85
04:55:34,0 --> 04:55:34,0
unto myself, holy men

86
04:55:34,0 --> 04:55:40,
that ye know not of.

87
04:55:40,0 --> 04:55:40,0
9 Wherefore, I

88
04:55:40,0 --> 04:55:40,0
say unto you that I

89
04:55:40,0 --> 04:55:40,0
have sent unto

90
04:55:40,0 --> 04:55:40,0
you mine

91
04:55:40,0 --> 04:55:40,0
everlasting covenant, even

92
04:55:40,0 --> 04:55:40,0
that which was

93
04:55:40,0 --> 04:55:46,
from the beginning.

94
04:55:46,0 --> 04:55:46,0
10 And that

95
04:55:46,0 --> 04:55:46,0
which I have

96
04:55:46,0 --> 04:55:46,0
promised I have so

97
04:55:46,0 --> 04:55:46,0
fulfilled, and the

98
04:55:46,0 --> 04:55:46,0
nations of the

99
04:55:46,0 --> 04:55:46,0
earth shall bow to

100
04:55:46,0 --> 04:55:46,0
it; and, if not

101
04:55:46,0 --> 04:55:46,0
of themselves,

102
04:55:46,0 --> 04:55:46,0
they shall come

103
04:55:46,0 --> 04:55:46,0
down, for that

104
04:55:46,0 --> 04:55:46,0
which is now

105
04:55:46,0 --> 04:55:46,0
exalted of itself

106
04:55:46,0 --> 04:55:52,
shall be laid low of power.

107
04:55:52,0 --> 04:55:52,0
11 Wherefore,

108
04:55:52,0 --> 04:55:52,0
I give unto

109
04:55:52,0 --> 04:55:52,0
you a

110
04:55:52,0 --> 04:55:52,0
commandment that ye go

111
04:55:52,0 --> 04:55:52,0
among this

112
04:55:52,0 --> 04:55:52,0
people, and say

113
04:55:52,0 --> 04:55:52,0
unto them, like

114
04:55:52,0 --> 04:55:52,0
unto mine

115
04:55:52,0 --> 04:55:52,0
apostle of old,

116
04:55:52,0 --> 04:55:58,
whose name was Peter:

117
04:55:58,0 --> 04:55:58,0
12 Believe on

118
04:55:58,0 --> 04:55:58,0
the name of

119
04:55:58,0 --> 04:55:58,0
the Lord

120
04:55:58,0 --> 04:55:58,0
Jesus, who was on

121
04:55:58,0 --> 04:55:58,0
the earth,

122
04:55:58,0 --> 04:55:58,0
and is to

123
04:55:58,0 --> 04:55:58,0
come, the

124
04:55:58,0 --> 04:57:02,
beginning and the end;

125
04:57:02,0 --> 04:57:02,0
13 Repent

126
04:57:02,0 --> 04:57:02,0
and be

127
04:57:02,0 --> 04:57:02,0
baptized in the

128
04:57:02,0 --> 04:57:02,0
name of Jesus

129
04:57:02,0 --> 04:57:02,0
Christ,

130
04:57:02,0 --> 04:57:02,0
according to the

131
04:57:02,0 --> 04:57:02,0
holy

132
04:57:02,0 --> 04:57:02,0
commandment, for

133
04:57:02,0 --> 05:28:01,
the remission of sins;

134
05:28:01,0 --> 05:28:01,0
14 And

135
05:28:01,0 --> 05:28:01,0
whoso doeth

136
05:28:01,0 --> 05:28:01,0
this shall

137
05:28:01,0 --> 05:28:01,0
receive the

138
05:28:01,0 --> 05:28:01,0
gift of the

139
05:28:01,0 --> 05:28:01,0
Holy Ghost,

140
05:28:01,0 --> 05:28:01,0
by the

141
05:28:01,0 --> 05:28:01,0
laying on of

142
05:28:01,0 --> 05:28:01,0
the hands of

143
05:28:01,0 --> 05:28:01,0
the elders

144
05:28:01,0 --> 05:49:04,
of the church.

145
05:49:04,0 --> 05:49:04,0
15 And

146
05:49:04,0 --> 05:49:04,0
again, verily

147
05:49:04,0 --> 05:49:04,0
I say

148
05:49:04,0 --> 05:49:04,0
unto you,

149
05:49:04,0 --> 05:49:04,0
that whoso

150
05:49:04,0 --> 05:49:04,0
forbiddeth

151
05:49:04,0 --> 05:49:04,0
to marry is

152
05:49:04,0 --> 05:49:04,0
not

153
05:49:04,0 --> 05:49:04,0
ordained of

154
05:49:04,0 --> 05:49:04,0
God, for

155
05:49:04,0 --> 05:49:04,0
marriage is

156
05:49:04,0 --> 05:49:04,0
ordained of

157
05:49:04,0 --> 05:48:42,
God unto man.

158
05:48:42,0 --> 05:48:42,0
16

159
05:48:42,0 --> 05:48:42,0
Wherefore, it

160
05:48:42,0 --> 05:48:42,0
is lawful

161
05:48:42,0 --> 05:48:42,0
that he

162
05:48:42,0 --> 05:48:42,0
should

163
05:48:42,0 --> 05:48:42,0
have one

164
05:48:42,0 --> 05:48:42,0
wife, and

165
05:48:42,0 --> 05:48:42,0
they twain

166
05:48:42,0 --> 05:48:42,0
shall be

167
05:48:42,0 --> 05:48:42,0
one

168
05:48:42,0 --> 05:48:42,0
flesh, and all

169
05:48:42,0 --> 05:48:42,0
this

170
05:48:42,0 --> 05:48:42,0
that the

171
05:48:42,0 --> 05:48:42,0
earth might

172
05:48:42,0 --> 05:48:42,0
answer

173
05:48:42,0 --> 05:48:20,
the end of its creation;

174
05:48:20,0 --> 05:48:20,0
17 And

175
05:48:20,0 --> 05:48:20,0
that it

176
05:48:20,0 --> 05:48:20,0
might be

177
05:48:20,0 --> 05:48:20,0
filled with

178
05:48:20,0 --> 05:48:20,0
the

179
05:48:20,0 --> 05:48:20,0
measure of

180
05:48:20,0 --> 05:48:20,0
man,

181
05:48:20,0 --> 05:48:20,0
according to his

182
05:48:20,0 --> 05:48:20,0
creation

183
05:48:20,0 --> 05:48:20,0
before

184
05:48:20,0 --> 05:48:20,0
the world

185
05:48:20,0 --> 05:44:00,
was made.

186
05:44:00,0 --> 05:44:00,0
18 And

187
05:44:00,0 --> 05:44:00,0
whoso

188
05:44:00,0 --> 05:44:00,0
forbiddeth

189
05:44:00,0 --> 05:44:00,0
to

190
05:44:00,0 --> 05:44:00,0
abstain from

191
05:44:00,0 --> 05:44:00,0
meats,

192
05:44:00,0 --> 05:44:00,0
that man

193
05:44:00,0 --> 05:44:00,0
should

194
05:44:00,0 --> 05:44:00,0
not eat

195
05:44:00,0 --> 05:44:00,0
the same,

196
05:44:00,0 --> 05:44:00,0
is not

197
05:44:00,0 --> 05:49:05,
ordained of God;

198
05:49:05,0 --> 05:49:05,0
19 For,

199
05:49:05,0 --> 05:49:05,0


200
05:49:05,0 --> 05:49:05,0
behold, the

201
05:49:05,0 --> 05:49:05,0
beasts

202
05:49:05,0 --> 05:49:05,0
of the

203
05:49:05,0 --> 05:49:05,0
field

204
05:49:05,0 --> 05:49:05,0
and the

205
05:49:05,0 --> 05:49:05,0
fowls of

206
05:49:05,0 --> 05:49:05,0
the

207
05:49:05,0 --> 05:49:05,0
air, and

208
05:49:05,0 --> 05:49:05,0
that

209
05:49:05,0 --> 05:49:05,0
which

210
05:49:05,0 --> 05:49:05,0
cometh of

211
05:49:05,0 --> 05:49:05,0
the

212
05:49:05,0 --> 05:49:05,0
earth, is

213
05:49:05,0 --> 05:49:05,0


214
05:49:05,0 --> 05:49:05,0
ordained for

215
05:49:05,0 --> 05:49:05,0
the use

216
05:49:05,0 --> 05:49:05,0
of man

217
05:49:05,0 --> 05:49:05,0
for

218
05:49:05,0 --> 05:49:05,0
food and

219
05:49:05,0 --> 05:49:05,0
