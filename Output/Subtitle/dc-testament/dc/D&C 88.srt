00:00:28,222 --> 00:00:36,694

4
00:00:36,694 --> 00:00:45,166
 it as the “‘olive leaf’ … plucked from the Tree of

5
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:53,638
 Paradise, the Lord’s message of peace to us.” The

6
00:00:53,638 --> 00:01:02,11
 revelation was given after high priests at a

7
00:01:02,11 --> 00:01:10,582

8
00:01:10,582 --> 00:01:19,054
 to reveal his will unto us concerning the

9
00:01:19,054 --> 00:01:27,526

37
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:20,199
1 Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you who have

38
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:24,199
 assembled yourselves together to receive his will

39
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:28,199
 concerning you

40
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:34,495
2 Behold, this is pleasing unto your Lord, and the

41
00:05:34,495 --> 00:05:40,495
 angels rejoice over you; the alms of your prayers

42
00:05:40,495 --> 00:05:46,495
 have come up into the ears of the Lord of

43
00:05:46,495 --> 00:05:52,495

44
00:05:52,495 --> 00:05:58,495
 sanctified, even them of the celestial world

45
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:04,659
3 Wherefore, I now send upon you another

46
00:06:04,659 --> 00:06:10,326
 Comforter, even upon you my friends, that it may abide in

47
00:06:10,326 --> 00:06:15,993
 your hearts, even the Holy Spirit of promise; which

48
00:06:15,993 --> 00:06:21,66
 other Comforter is the same that I promised unto

49
00:06:21,66 --> 00:06:27,327
 my disciples, as is recorded in the testimony of

50
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:32,994
 John

51
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:35,192
4 This Comforter is the promise which I give unto

52
00:06:35,192 --> 00:06:37,859
 you of eternal life, even the glory of the

53
00:06:37,859 --> 00:06:40,526
 celestial kingdom

54
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:47,366
5 Which glory is that of the church of the

55
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:54,699
 Firstborn, even of God, the holiest of all, through Jesus

56
00:06:54,699 --> 00:07:02,032
 Christ his Son

57
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:09,289
6 He that ascended up on high, as also he

58
00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:16,039
 descended below all things, in that he comprehended all

59
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:22,789
 things, that he might be in all and through all

60
00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:29,539
 things, the light of truth

61
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:35,549
7 Which truth shineth. This is the light of

62
00:07:35,549 --> 00:07:41,549
 Christ. As also he is in the sun, and the light of the

63
00:07:41,549 --> 00:07:47,549
 sun, and the power thereof by which it was made

64
00:07:47,55 --> 00:07:51,55
8 As also he is in the moon, and is the light of

65
00:07:51,55 --> 00:07:55,55
 the moon, and the power thereof by which it was

66
00:07:55,55 --> 00:07:59,55
 made

67
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:04,546
9 As also the light of the stars, and the power

68
00:08:04,546 --> 00:08:09,546
 thereof by which they were made

69
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:14,056
10 And the earth also, and the power thereof, even

70
00:08:14,056 --> 00:08:18,556
 the earth upon which you stand

71
00:08:18,348 --> 00:08:23,598
11 And the light which shineth, which giveth you

72
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:28,848
 light, is through him who enlighteneth your eyes,

73
00:08:28,848 --> 00:08:34,098
 which is the same light that quickeneth your

74
00:08:34,098 --> 00:08:39,348
 understandings

75
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:45,386
12 Which light proceedeth forth from the presence

76
00:08:45,386 --> 00:08:51,386
 of God to fill the immensity of space

77
00:08:51,147 --> 00:08:56,747
13 The light which is in all things, which giveth

78
00:08:56,747 --> 00:09:02,347
 life to all things, which is the law by which all

79
00:09:02,347 --> 00:09:07,947
 things are governed, even the power of God who

80
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:13,547
 sitteth upon his throne, who is in the bosom of

81
00:09:13,547 --> 00:09:19,147
 eternity, who is in the midst of all things

82
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:23,426
14 Now, verily I say unto you, that through the

83
00:09:23,426 --> 00:09:27,426
 redemption which is made for you is brought to pass

84
00:09:27,426 --> 00:09:31,426
 the resurrection from the dead

85
00:09:31,187 --> 00:09:34,187
15 And the spirit and the body are the soul of

86
00:09:34,187 --> 00:09:37,187
 man

87
00:09:37,727 --> 00:09:42,727
16 And the resurrection from the dead is the

88
00:09:42,727 --> 00:09:47,727
 redemption of the soul

89
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:53,254
17 And the redemption of the soul is through him

90
00:09:53,254 --> 00:09:58,754
 that quickeneth all things, in whose bosom it is

91
00:09:58,754 --> 00:10:04,254
 decreed that the poor and the meek of the earth

92
00:10:04,254 --> 00:10:09,754
 shall inherit it

93
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:14,075
18 Therefore, it must needs be sanctified from all

94
00:10:14,075 --> 00:10:18,408
 unrighteousness, that it may be prepared for the

95
00:10:18,408 --> 00:10:22,741
 celestial glory

96
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:26,855
19 For after it hath filled the measure of its

97
00:10:26,855 --> 00:10:31,188
 creation, it shall be crowned with glory, even with

98
00:10:31,188 --> 00:10:35,521
 the presence of God the Father

99
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:40,285
20 That bodies who are of the celestial kingdom

100
00:10:40,285 --> 00:10:45,035
 may possess it forever and ever; for, for this

101
00:10:45,035 --> 00:10:49,785
 intent was it made and created, and for this intent are

102
00:10:49,785 --> 00:10:54,535
 they sanctified

103
00:10:54,537 --> 00:10:58,537
21 And they who are not sanctified through the law

104
00:10:58,537 --> 00:11:02,537
 which I have given unto you, even the law of

105
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:06,537
 Christ, must inherit another kingdom, even that of a

106
00:11:06,537 --> 00:11:10,537
 terrestrial kingdom, or that of a telestial

107
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:14,537
 kingdom

108
00:11:14,524 --> 00:11:21,024
22 For he who is not able to abide the law of a

109
00:11:21,024 --> 00:11:27,524
 celestial kingdom cannot abide a celestial glory

110
00:11:27,537 --> 00:11:32,037
23 And he who cannot abide the law of a

111
00:11:32,037 --> 00:11:36,537
 terrestrial kingdom cannot abide a terrestrial glory

112
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:41,396
24 And he who cannot abide the law of a telestial

113
00:11:41,396 --> 00:11:46,196
 kingdom cannot abide a telestial glory; therefore

114
00:11:46,196 --> 00:11:50,996
 he is not meet for a kingdom of glory. Therefore

115
00:11:50,996 --> 00:11:55,796
 he must abide a kingdom which is not a kingdom of

116
00:11:55,796 --> 00:12:00,596
 glory

117
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:04,336
25 And again, verily I say unto you, the earth

118
00:12:04,336 --> 00:12:08,586
 abideth the law of a celestial kingdom, for it

119
00:12:08,586 --> 00:12:12,836
 filleth the measure of its creation, and transgresseth

120
00:12:12,836 --> 00:12:17,086
 not the law

121
00:12:17,37 --> 00:12:23,62
26 Wherefore, it shall be sanctified; yea,

122
00:12:23,62 --> 00:12:29,87
 notwithstanding it shall die, it shall be quickened

123
00:12:29,87 --> 00:12:36,12
 again, and shall abide the power by which it is

124
00:12:36,12 --> 00:12:42,37
 quickened, and the righteous shall inherit it

125
00:12:42,378 --> 00:12:47,878
27 For notwithstanding they die, they also shall

126
00:12:47,878 --> 00:12:53,378
 rise again, a spiritual body

127
00:12:53,389 --> 00:12:59,639
28 They who are of a celestial spirit shall

128
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:05,889
 receive the same body which was a natural body; even ye

129
00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:12,139
 shall receive your bodies, and your glory shall be

130
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:18,389
 that glory by which your bodies are quickened

131
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:22,398
29 Ye who are quickened by a portion of the

132
00:13:22,398 --> 00:13:26,398
 celestial glory shall then receive of the same, even a

133
00:13:26,398 --> 00:13:30,398
 fulness

134
00:13:30,693 --> 00:13:35,026
30 And they who are quickened by a portion of the

135
00:13:35,026 --> 00:13:39,359
 terrestrial glory shall then receive of the same,

136
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:43,692
 even a fulness

137
00:13:43,473 --> 00:13:47,806
31 And also they who are quickened by a portion of

138
00:13:47,806 --> 00:13:52,139
 the telestial glory shall then receive of the

139
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:56,472
 same, even a fulness

140
00:13:56,986 --> 00:14:01,586
32 And they who remain shall also be quickened;

141
00:14:01,586 --> 00:14:06,186
 nevertheless, they shall return again to their own

142
00:14:06,186 --> 00:14:10,786
 place, to enjoy that which they are willing to

143
00:14:10,786 --> 00:14:15,386
 receive, because they were not willing to enjoy that

144
00:14:15,386 --> 00:14:19,986
 which they might have received

145
00:14:19,742 --> 00:14:24,142
33 For what doth it profit a man if a gift is

146
00:14:24,142 --> 00:14:28,542
 bestowed upon him, and he receive not the gift?

147
00:14:28,542 --> 00:14:32,942
 Behold, he rejoices not in that which is given unto him,

148
00:14:32,942 --> 00:14:37,342
 neither rejoices in him who is the giver of the

149
00:14:37,342 --> 00:14:41,742
 gift

150
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:45,914
34 And again, verily I say unto you, that which is

151
00:14:45,914 --> 00:14:50,581
 governed by law is also preserved by law and

152
00:14:50,581 --> 00:14:55,248
 perfected and sanctified by the same

153
00:14:55,528 --> 00:15:01,195
35 That which breaketh a law, and abideth not by

154
00:15:01,195 --> 00:15:06,862
 law, but seeketh to become a law unto itself, and

155
00:15:06,862 --> 00:15:12,529
 willeth to abide in sin, and altogether abideth in

156
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:18,196
 sin, cannot be sanctified by law, neither by

157
00:15:18,196 --> 00:15:23,863
 mercy, justice, nor judgment. Therefore, they must

158
00:15:23,863 --> 00:15:29,53
 remain filthy still

159
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:35,278
36 All kingdoms have a law given

160
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:40,801
37 And there are many kingdoms; for there is no

161
00:15:40,801 --> 00:15:46,301
 space in the which there is no kingdom; and there is

162
00:15:46,301 --> 00:15:51,801
 no kingdom in which there is no space, either a

163
00:15:51,801 --> 00:15:57,301
 greater or a lesser kingdom

164
00:15:57,573 --> 00:16:02,573
38 And unto every kingdom is given a law; and unto

165
00:16:02,573 --> 00:16:07,573
 every law there are certain bounds also and

166
00:16:07,573 --> 00:16:12,573
 conditions

167
00:16:12,088 --> 00:16:17,088
39 All beings who abide not in those conditions

168
00:16:17,088 --> 00:16:22,088
 are not justified

169
00:16:22,865 --> 00:16:30,865
40 For intelligence cleaveth unto intelligence;

170
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:38,865
 wisdom receiveth wisdom; truth embraceth truth;

171
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:46,865
 virtue loveth virtue; light cleaveth unto light; mercy

172
00:16:46,865 --> 00:16:54,865
 hath compassion on mercy and claimeth her own;

173
00:16:54,865 --> 00:17:02,865
 justice continueth its course and claimeth its own;

174
00:17:02,865 --> 00:17:10,865
 judgment goeth before the face of him who sitteth

175
00:17:10,865 --> 00:17:18,865
 upon the throne and governeth and executeth all

176
00:17:18,865 --> 00:17:26,865
 things

177
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:32,963
41 He comprehendeth all things, and all things are

178
00:17:32,963 --> 00:17:39,13
 before him, and all things are round about him;

179
00:17:39,13 --> 00:17:45,297
 and he is above all things, and in all things, and

180
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:51,464
 is through all things, and is round about all

181
00:17:51,464 --> 00:17:57,631
 things; and all things are by him, and of him, even

182
00:17:57,631 --> 00:18:03,798
 God, forever and ever

183
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:10,116
42 And again, verily I say unto you, he hath given

184
00:18:10,116 --> 00:18:16,449
 a law unto all things, by which they move in

185
00:18:16,449 --> 00:18:22,782
 their times and their seasons

186
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:29,968
43 And their courses are fixed, even the courses

187
00:18:29,968 --> 00:18:37,635
 of the heavens and the earth, which comprehend the

188
00:18:37,635 --> 00:18:45,302
 earth and all the planets

189
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:52,857
44 And they give light to each other in their

190
00:18:52,857 --> 00:19:00,657
 times and in their seasons, in their minutes, in their

191
00:19:00,657 --> 00:19:08,457
 hours, in their days, in their weeks, in their

192
00:19:08,457 --> 00:19:16,257
 months, in their years—all these are one year with

193
00:19:16,257 --> 00:19:24,057
 God, but not with man

194
00:19:24,03 --> 00:19:33,43
45 The earth rolls upon her wings, and the sun

195
00:19:33,43 --> 00:19:42,83
 giveth his light by day, and the moon giveth her

196
00:19:42,83 --> 00:19:52,23
 light by night, and the stars also give their light,

197
00:19:52,23 --> 00:20:01,63
 as they roll upon their wings in their glory, in

198
00:20:01,63 --> 00:20:11,03
 the midst of the power of God

199
00:20:11,494 --> 00:20:18,494
46 Unto what shall I liken these kingdoms, that ye

200
00:20:18,494 --> 00:20:25,494
 may understand

201
00:20:25,007 --> 00:20:33,34
47 Behold, all these are kingdoms, and any man who

202
00:20:33,34 --> 00:20:41,673
 hath seen any or the least of these hath seen God

203
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:50,006
 moving in his majesty and power

204
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:57,015
48 I say unto you, he hath seen him; nevertheless,

205
00:20:57,015 --> 00:21:04,015
 he who came unto his own was not comprehended

206
00:21:04,78 --> 00:21:10,53
49 The light shineth in darkness, and the darkness

207
00:21:10,53 --> 00:21:16,28
 comprehendeth it not; nevertheless, the day shall

208
00:21:16,28 --> 00:21:22,03
 come when you shall comprehend even God, being

209
00:21:22,03 --> 00:21:27,78
 quickened in him and by him

210
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:32,786
50 Then shall ye know that ye have seen me, that I

211
00:21:32,786 --> 00:21:38,036
 am, and that I am the true light that is in you,

212
00:21:38,036 --> 00:21:43,286
 and that you are in me; otherwise ye could not

213
00:21:43,286 --> 00:21:48,536
 abound

214
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:57,141
51 Behold, I will liken these kingdoms unto a man

215
00:21:57,141 --> 00:22:05,474
 having a field, and he sent forth his servants

216
00:22:05,474 --> 00:22:13,807
 into the field to dig in the field

217
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:18,082
52 And he said unto the first: Go ye and labor in

218
00:22:18,082 --> 00:22:22,582
 the field, and in the first hour I will come unto

219
00:22:22,582 --> 00:22:27,082
 you, and ye shall behold the joy of my

220
00:22:27,082 --> 00:22:31,582
 countenance

221
00:22:31,584 --> 00:22:37,584
53 And he said unto the second: Go ye also into

222
00:22:37,584 --> 00:22:43,584
 the field, and in the second hour I will visit you

223
00:22:43,584 --> 00:22:49,584
 with the joy of my countenance

224
00:22:49,351 --> 00:22:52,851
54 And also unto the third, saying: I will visit

225
00:22:52,851 --> 00:22:56,351
 you

226
00:22:56,625 --> 00:23:01,125
55 And unto the fourth, and so on unto the

227
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:05,625
 twelfth

228
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:09,667
56 And the lord of the field went unto the first

229
00:23:09,667 --> 00:23:13,917
 in the first hour, and tarried with him all that

230
00:23:13,917 --> 00:23:18,167
 hour, and he was made glad with the light of the

231
00:23:18,167 --> 00:23:22,417
 countenance of his lord

232
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:28,034
57 And then he withdrew from the first that he

233
00:23:28,034 --> 00:23:33,367
 might visit the second also, and the third, and the

234
00:23:33,367 --> 00:23:38,7
 fourth, and so on unto the twelfth

235
00:23:38,45 --> 00:23:43,45
58 And thus they all received the light of the

236
00:23:43,45 --> 00:23:48,45
 countenance of their lord, every man in his hour, and

237
00:23:48,45 --> 00:23:53,45
 in his time, and in his season

238
00:23:53,716 --> 00:23:59,383
59 Beginning at the first, and so on unto the

239
00:23:59,383 --> 00:24:05,05
 last, and from the last unto the first, and from the

240
00:24:05,05 --> 00:24:10,717
 first unto the last

241
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:15,415
60 Every man in his own order, until his hour was

242
00:24:15,415 --> 00:24:20,815
 finished, even according as his lord had commanded

243
00:24:20,815 --> 00:24:26,215
 him, that his lord might be glorified in him, and

244
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:31,615
 he in his lord, that they all might be glorified

245
00:24:31,615 --> 00:24:37,015


246
00:24:37,993 --> 00:24:43,593
61 Therefore, unto this parable I will liken all

247
00:24:43,593 --> 00:24:49,193
 these kingdoms, and the inhabitants thereof—every

248
00:24:49,193 --> 00:24:54,793
 kingdom in its hour, and in its time, and in its

249
00:24:54,793 --> 00:25:00,393
 season, even according to the decree which God hath

250
00:25:00,393 --> 00:25:05,993
 made

251
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:11,238
62 And again, verily I say unto you, my friends, I

252
00:25:11,238 --> 00:25:16,738
 leave these sayings with you to ponder in your

253
00:25:16,738 --> 00:25:22,238
 hearts, with this commandment which I give unto you,

254
00:25:22,238 --> 00:25:27,738
 that ye shall call upon me while I am near

255
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:33,726
63 Draw near unto me and I will draw near unto

256
00:25:33,726 --> 00:25:39,726
 you; seek me diligently and ye shall find me; ask,

257
00:25:39,726 --> 00:25:45,726
 and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened

258
00:25:45,726 --> 00:25:51,726
 unto you

259
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:55,967
64 Whatsoever ye ask the Father in my name it

260
00:25:55,967 --> 00:26:00,467
 shall be given unto you, that is expedient for you

261
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:06,759
65 And if ye ask anything that is not expedient

262
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:12,759
 for you, it shall turn unto your condemnation

263
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:18,37
66 Behold, that which you hear is as the voice of

264
00:26:18,37 --> 00:26:24,703
 one crying in the wilderness—in the wilderness,

265
00:26:24,703 --> 00:26:31,036
 because you cannot see him—my voice, because my

266
00:26:31,036 --> 00:26:37,369
 voice is Spirit; my Spirit is truth; truth abideth and

267
00:26:37,369 --> 00:26:43,702
 hath no end; and if it be in you it shall abound

268
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:50,035


269
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:56,292
67 And if your eye be single to my glory, your

270
00:26:56,292 --> 00:27:02,042
 whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there

271
00:27:02,042 --> 00:27:07,792
 shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is

272
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:13,542
 filled with light comprehendeth all things

273
00:27:13,065 --> 00:27:18,465
68 Therefore, sanctify yourselves that your minds

274
00:27:18,465 --> 00:27:23,865
 become single to God, and the days will come that

275
00:27:23,865 --> 00:27:29,265
 you shall see him; for he will unveil his face

276
00:27:29,265 --> 00:27:34,665
 unto you, and it shall be in his own time, and in his

277
00:27:34,665 --> 00:27:40,065
 own way, and according to his own will

278
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:46,226
69 Remember the great and last promise which I

279
00:27:46,226 --> 00:27:51,893
 have made unto you; cast away your idle thoughts and

280
00:27:51,893 --> 00:27:57,56
 your excess of laughter far from you

281
00:27:57,576 --> 00:28:03,576
70 Tarry ye, tarry ye in this place, and call a

282
00:28:03,576 --> 00:28:09,576
 solemn assembly, even of those who are the first

283
00:28:09,576 --> 00:28:15,576
 laborers in this last kingdom

284
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:19,593
71 And let those whom they have warned in their

285
00:28:19,593 --> 00:28:24,093
 traveling call on the Lord, and ponder the warning

286
00:28:24,093 --> 00:28:28,593
 in their hearts which they have received, for a

287
00:28:28,593 --> 00:28:33,093
 little season

288
00:28:33,862 --> 00:28:42,362
72 Behold, and lo, I will take care of your

289
00:28:42,362 --> 00:28:50,862
 flocks, and will raise up elders and send unto them

290
00:28:50,879 --> 00:28:59,879
73 Behold, I will hasten my work in its time

291
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:05,171
74 And I give unto you, who are the first laborers

292
00:29:05,171 --> 00:29:10,671
 in this last kingdom, a commandment that you

293
00:29:10,671 --> 00:29:16,171
 assemble yourselves together, and organize yourselves,

294
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:21,671
 and prepare yourselves, and sanctify yourselves;

295
00:29:21,671 --> 00:29:27,171
 yea, purify your hearts, and cleanse your hands

296
00:29:27,171 --> 00:29:32,671
 and your feet before me, that I may make you clean

297
00:29:32,22 --> 00:29:38,02
75 That I may testify unto your Father, and your

298
00:29:38,02 --> 00:29:43,82
 God, and my God, that you are clean from the blood

299
00:29:43,82 --> 00:29:49,62
 of this wicked generation; that I may fulfil this

300
00:29:49,62 --> 00:29:55,42
 promise, this great and last promise, which I have

301
00:29:55,42 --> 00:30:01,22
 made unto you, when I will

302
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:04,717
76 Also, I give unto you a commandment that ye

303
00:30:04,717 --> 00:30:07,717
 shall continue in prayer and fasting from this time

304
00:30:07,717 --> 00:30:10,717
 forth

305
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:14,509
77 And I give unto you a commandment that you

306
00:30:14,509 --> 00:30:18,509
 shall teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom

307
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:23,65
78 Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend

308
00:30:23,65 --> 00:30:28,483
 you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in

309
00:30:28,483 --> 00:30:33,316
 theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of

310
00:30:33,316 --> 00:30:38,149
 the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the

311
00:30:38,149 --> 00:30:42,982
 kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to

312
00:30:42,982 --> 00:30:47,815
 understand

313
00:30:47,112 --> 00:30:53,112
79 Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and

314
00:30:53,112 --> 00:30:59,112
 under the earth; things which have been, things

315
00:30:59,112 --> 00:31:05,112
 which are, things which must shortly come to pass;

316
00:31:05,112 --> 00:31:11,112
 things which are at home, things which are abroad;

317
00:31:11,112 --> 00:31:17,112
 the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and

318
00:31:17,112 --> 00:31:23,112
 the judgments which are on the land; and a

319
00:31:23,112 --> 00:31:29,112
 knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms

320
00:31:29,855 --> 00:31:35,605
80 That ye may be prepared in all things when I

321
00:31:35,605 --> 00:31:41,355
 shall send you again to magnify the calling

322
00:31:41,355 --> 00:31:47,105
 whereunto I have called you, and the mission with which I

323
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:52,855
 have commissioned you

324
00:31:52,127 --> 00:31:58,794
81 Behold, I sent you out to testify and warn the

325
00:31:58,794 --> 00:32:05,461
 people, and it becometh every man who hath been

326
00:32:05,461 --> 00:32:12,128
 warned to warn his neighbor

327
00:32:12,114 --> 00:32:16,114
82 Therefore, they are left without excuse, and

328
00:32:16,114 --> 00:32:20,114
 their sins are upon their own heads

329
00:32:20,422 --> 00:32:24,922
83 He that seeketh me early shall find me, and

330
00:32:24,922 --> 00:32:29,422
 shall not be forsaken

331
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:34,614
84 Therefore, tarry ye, and labor diligently, that

332
00:32:34,614 --> 00:32:39,782
 you may be perfected in your ministry to go forth

333
00:32:39,782 --> 00:32:44,948
 among the Gentiles for the last time, as many as

334
00:32:44,948 --> 00:32:50,115
 the mouth of the Lord shall name, to bind up the

335
00:32:50,115 --> 00:32:55,283
 law and seal up the testimony, and to prepare the

336
00:32:55,283 --> 00:33:00,449
 saints for the hour of judgment which is to come

337
00:33:00,695 --> 00:33:06,695
85 That their souls may escape the wrath of God,

338
00:33:06,695 --> 00:33:12,695
 the desolation of abomination which awaits the

339
00:33:12,695 --> 00:33:18,695
 wicked, both in this world and in the world to come.

340
00:33:18,695 --> 00:33:24,695
 Verily, I say unto you, let those who are not the

341
00:33:24,695 --> 00:33:30,695
 first elders continue in the vineyard until the

342
00:33:30,695 --> 00:33:36,695
 mouth of the Lord shall call them, for their time is

343
00:33:36,695 --> 00:33:42,695
 not yet come; their garments are not clean from

344
00:33:42,695 --> 00:33:48,695
 the blood of this generation

345
00:33:48,41 --> 00:33:54,743
86 Abide ye in the liberty wherewith ye are made

346
00:33:54,743 --> 00:34:01,076
 free; entangle not yourselves in sin, but let your

347
00:34:01,076 --> 00:34:07,409
 hands be clean, until the Lord comes

348
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:12,983
87 For not many days hence and the earth shall

349
00:34:12,983 --> 00:34:18,554
 tremble and reel to and fro as a drunken man; and the

350
00:34:18,554 --> 00:34:24,125
 sun shall hide his face, and shall refuse to give

351
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:29,696
 light; and the moon shall be bathed in blood; and

352
00:34:29,696 --> 00:34:35,267
 the stars shall become exceedingly angry, and

353
00:34:35,267 --> 00:34:40,838
 shall cast themselves down as a fig that falleth from

354
00:34:40,838 --> 00:34:46,409
 off a fig tree

355
00:34:46,151 --> 00:34:50,651
88 And after your testimony cometh wrath and

356
00:34:50,651 --> 00:34:55,151
 indignation upon the people

357
00:34:55,677 --> 00:35:00,677
89 For after your testimony cometh the testimony

358
00:35:00,677 --> 00:35:05,677
 of earthquakes, that shall cause groanings in the

359
00:35:05,677 --> 00:35:10,677
 midst of her, and men shall fall upon the ground

360
00:35:10,677 --> 00:35:15,677
 and shall not be able to stand

361
00:35:15,664 --> 00:35:21,414
90 And also cometh the testimony of the voice of

362
00:35:21,414 --> 00:35:27,164
 thunderings, and the voice of lightnings, and the

363
00:35:27,164 --> 00:35:32,914
 voice of tempests, and the voice of the waves of

364
00:35:32,914 --> 00:35:38,664
 the sea heaving themselves beyond their bounds

365
00:35:38,92 --> 00:35:43,253
91 And all things shall be in commotion; and

366
00:35:43,253 --> 00:35:47,586
 surely, men’s hearts shall fail them; for fear shall

367
00:35:47,586 --> 00:35:51,919
 come upon all people

368
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:56,883
92 And angels shall fly through the midst of

369
00:35:56,883 --> 00:36:02,05
 heaven, crying with a loud voice, sounding the trump of

370
00:36:02,05 --> 00:36:07,217
 God, saying: Prepare ye, prepare ye, O

371
00:36:07,217 --> 00:36:12,384
 inhabitants of the earth; for the judgment of our God is

372
00:36:12,384 --> 00:36:17,551
 come. Behold, and lo, the Bridegroom cometh; go ye

373
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:22,718
 out to meet him

374
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:27,213
93 And immediately there shall appear a great sign

375
00:36:27,213 --> 00:36:32,213
 in heaven, and all people shall see it together

376
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:40,132
94 And another angel shall sound his trump,

377
00:36:40,132 --> 00:36:48,041
 saying: That great church, the mother of abominations,

378
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:55,95
 that made all nations drink of the wine of the

379
00:36:55,95 --> 00:37:03,859
 wrath of her fornication, that persecuteth the saints

380
00:37:03,859 --> 00:37:11,768
 of God, that shed their blood—she who sitteth upon

381
00:37:11,768 --> 00:37:19,677
 many waters, and upon the islands of the

382
00:37:19,677 --> 00:37:27,586
 sea—behold, she is the tares of the earth; she is bound in

383
00:37:27,586 --> 00:37:35,495
 bundles; her bands are made strong, no man can

384
00:37:35,495 --> 00:37:43,404
 loose them; therefore, she is ready to be burned.

385
00:37:43,404 --> 00:37:51,313
 And he shall sound his trump both long and loud, and

386
00:37:51,313 --> 00:37:59,222
 all nations shall hear it

387
00:37:59,144 --> 00:38:04,144
95 And there shall be silence in heaven for the

388
00:38:04,144 --> 00:38:09,144
 space of half an hour; and immediately after shall

389
00:38:09,144 --> 00:38:14,144
 the curtain of heaven be unfolded, as a scroll is

390
00:38:14,144 --> 00:38:19,144
 unfolded after it is rolled up, and the face of the

391
00:38:19,144 --> 00:38:24,144
 Lord shall be unveiled

392
00:38:24,419 --> 00:38:27,752
96 And the saints that are upon the earth, who are

393
00:38:27,752 --> 00:38:31,085
 alive, shall be quickened and be caught up to

394
00:38:31,085 --> 00:38:34,418
 meet him

395
00:38:34,195 --> 00:38:38,945
97 And they who have slept in their graves shall

396
00:38:38,945 --> 00:38:43,695
 come forth, for their graves shall be opened; and

397
00:38:43,695 --> 00:38:48,445
 they also shall be caught up to meet him in the

398
00:38:48,445 --> 00:38:53,195
 midst of the pillar of heaven

399
00:38:53,698 --> 00:39:00,498
98 They are Christ’s, the first fruits, they who

400
00:39:00,498 --> 00:39:07,298
 shall descend with him first, and they who are on

401
00:39:07,298 --> 00:39:14,098
 the earth and in their graves, who are first caught

402
00:39:14,098 --> 00:39:20,898
 up to meet him; and all this by the voice of the

403
00:39:20,898 --> 00:39:27,698
 sounding of the trump of the angel of God

404
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:33,781
99 And after this another angel shall sound, which

405
00:39:33,781 --> 00:39:40,114
 is the second trump; and then cometh the

406
00:39:40,114 --> 00:39:46,447
 redemption of those who are Christ’s at his coming; who

407
00:39:46,447 --> 00:39:52,78
 have received their part in that prison which is

408
00:39:52,78 --> 00:39:59,113
 prepared for them, that they might receive the

409
00:39:59,113 --> 00:40:05,446
 gospel, and be judged according to men in the flesh

410
00:40:05,186 --> 00:40:09,186
100 And again, another trump shall sound, which is

411
00:40:09,186 --> 00:40:13,186
 the third trump; and then come the spirits of men

412
00:40:13,186 --> 00:40:17,186
 who are to be judged, and are found under

413
00:40:17,186 --> 00:40:21,186
 condemnation

414
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:25,836
101 And these are the rest of the dead; and they

415
00:40:25,836 --> 00:40:30,503
 live not again until the thousand years are ended,

416
00:40:30,503 --> 00:40:35,17
 neither again, until the end of the earth

417
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:41,433
102 And another trump shall sound, which is the

418
00:40:41,433 --> 00:40:47,183
 fourth trump, saying: There are found among those

419
00:40:47,183 --> 00:40:52,933
 who are to remain until that great and last day,

420
00:40:52,933 --> 00:40:58,683
 even the end, who shall remain filthy still

421
00:40:58,673 --> 00:41:02,673
103 And another trump shall sound, which is the

422
00:41:02,673 --> 00:41:06,673
 fifth trump, which is the fifth angel who committeth

423
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:10,673
 the everlasting gospel—flying through the midst

424
00:41:10,673 --> 00:41:14,673
 of heaven, unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and

425
00:41:14,673 --> 00:41:18,673
 people

426
00:41:18,66 --> 00:41:24,285
104 And this shall be the sound of his trump,

427
00:41:24,285 --> 00:41:29,91
 saying to all people, both in heaven and in earth, and

428
00:41:29,91 --> 00:41:35,535
 that are under the earth—for every ear shall hear

429
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:41,16
 it, and every knee shall bow, and every tongue

430
00:41:41,16 --> 00:41:46,785
 shall confess, while they hear the sound of the

431
00:41:46,785 --> 00:41:52,41
 trump, saying: Fear God, and give glory to him who

432
00:41:52,41 --> 00:41:58,035
 sitteth upon the throne, forever and ever; for the

433
00:41:58,035 --> 00:42:03,66
 hour of his judgment is come

434
00:42:03,905 --> 00:42:13,405
105 And again, another angel shall sound his

435
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:22,905
 trump, which is the sixth angel, saying: She is fallen

436
00:42:22,905 --> 00:42:32,405
 who made all nations drink of the wine of the

437
00:42:32,405 --> 00:42:41,905
 wrath of her fornication; she is fallen, is fallen

438
00:42:41,876 --> 00:42:48,209
106 And again, another angel shall sound his

439
00:42:48,209 --> 00:42:54,542
 trump, which is the seventh angel, saying: It is

440
00:42:54,542 --> 00:43:00,875
 finished; it is finished! The Lamb of God hath overcome

441
00:43:00,875 --> 00:43:07,208
 and trodden the wine-press alone, even the

442
00:43:07,208 --> 00:43:13,541
 wine-press of the fierceness of the wrath of Almighty

443
00:43:13,541 --> 00:43:19,874
 God

444
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:25,347
107 And then shall the angels be crowned with the

445
00:43:25,347 --> 00:43:30,847
 glory of his might, and the saints shall be filled

446
00:43:30,847 --> 00:43:36,347
 with his glory, and receive their inheritance and

447
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:41,847
 be made equal with him

448
00:43:41,602 --> 00:43:49,352
108 And then shall the first angel again sound his

449
00:43:49,352 --> 00:43:57,102
 trump in the ears of all living, and reveal the

450
00:43:57,102 --> 00:44:04,852
 secret acts of men, and the mighty works of God in

451
00:44:04,852 --> 00:44:12,602
 the first thousand years

452
00:44:12,85 --> 00:44:19,35
109 And then shall the second angel sound his

453
00:44:19,35 --> 00:44:25,85
 trump, and reveal the secret acts of men, and the

454
00:44:25,85 --> 00:44:32,35
 thoughts and intents of their hearts, and the mighty

455
00:44:32,35 --> 00:44:38,85
 works of God in the second thousand years

456
00:44:38,376 --> 00:44:43,376
110 And so on, until the seventh angel shall sound

457
00:44:43,376 --> 00:44:48,376
 his trump; and he shall stand forth upon the land

458
00:44:48,376 --> 00:44:53,376
 and upon the sea, and swear in the name of him

459
00:44:53,376 --> 00:44:58,376
 who sitteth upon the throne, that there shall be

460
00:44:58,376 --> 00:45:03,376
 time no longer; and Satan shall be bound, that old

461
00:45:03,376 --> 00:45:08,376
 serpent, who is called the devil, and shall not be

462
00:45:08,376 --> 00:45:13,376
 loosed for the space of a thousand years

463
00:45:13,861 --> 00:45:20,361
111 And then he shall be loosed for a little

464
00:45:20,361 --> 00:45:26,861
 season, that he may gather together his armies

465
00:45:26,39 --> 00:45:32,39
112 And Michael, the seventh angel, even the

466
00:45:32,39 --> 00:45:38,39
 archangel, shall gather together his armies, even the

467
00:45:38,39 --> 00:45:44,39
 hosts of heaven

468
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:50,825
113 And the devil shall gather together his

469
00:45:50,825 --> 00:45:57,492
 armies; even the hosts of hell, and shall come up to

470
00:45:57,492 --> 00:46:04,159
 battle against Michael and his armies

471
00:46:04,145 --> 00:46:09,645
114 And then cometh the battle of the great God;

472
00:46:09,645 --> 00:46:15,145
 and the devil and his armies shall be cast away

473
00:46:15,145 --> 00:46:20,645
 into their own place, that they shall not have power

474
00:46:20,645 --> 00:46:26,145
 over the saints any more at all

475
00:46:26,133 --> 00:46:32,466
115 For Michael shall fight their battles, and

476
00:46:32,466 --> 00:46:38,799
 shall overcome him who seeketh the throne of him who

477
00:46:38,799 --> 00:46:45,132
 sitteth upon the throne, even the Lamb

478
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:53,136
116 This is the glory of God, and the sanctified;

479
00:46:53,136 --> 00:47:00,636
 and they shall not any more see death

480
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:04,901
117 Therefore, verily I say unto you, my friends,

481
00:47:04,901 --> 00:47:08,901
 call your solemn assembly, as I have commanded

482
00:47:08,901 --> 00:47:12,901
 you

483
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:17,663
118 And as all have not faith, seek ye diligently

484
00:47:17,663 --> 00:47:22,913
 and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek

485
00:47:22,913 --> 00:47:28,163
 ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek

486
00:47:28,163 --> 00:47:33,413
 learning, even by study and also by faith

487
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:39,534
119 Organize yourselves; prepare every needful

488
00:47:39,534 --> 00:47:45,134
 thing; and establish a house, even a house of prayer,

489
00:47:45,134 --> 00:47:50,734
 a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of

490
00:47:50,734 --> 00:47:56,334
 learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a

491
00:47:56,334 --> 00:48:01,934
 house of God

492
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:06,679
120 That your incomings may be in the name of the

493
00:48:06,679 --> 00:48:11,679
 Lord; that your outgoings may be in the name of

494
00:48:11,679 --> 00:48:16,679
 the Lord; that all your salutations may be in the

495
00:48:16,679 --> 00:48:21,679
 name of the Lord, with uplifted hands unto the Most

496
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:26,679
 High

497
00:48:26,72 --> 00:48:31,97
121 Therefore, cease from all your light speeches,

498
00:48:31,97 --> 00:48:37,22
 from all laughter, from all your lustful desires,

499
00:48:37,22 --> 00:48:42,47
 from all your pride and light-mindedness, and

500
00:48:42,47 --> 00:48:47,72
 from all your wicked doings

501
00:48:47,992 --> 00:48:54,992
122 Appoint among yourselves a teacher, and let

502
00:48:54,992 --> 00:49:01,992
 not all be spokesmen at once; but let one speak at a

503
00:49:01,992 --> 00:49:08,992
 time and let all listen unto his sayings, that

504
00:49:08,992 --> 00:49:15,992
 when all have spoken that all may be edified of all,

505
00:49:15,992 --> 00:49:22,992
 and that every man may have an equal privilege

506
00:49:22,493 --> 00:49:27,16
123 See that ye love one another; cease to be

507
00:49:27,16 --> 00:49:31,827
 covetous; learn to impart one to another as the gospel

508
00:49:31,827 --> 00:49:36,494
 requires

509
00:49:36,006 --> 00:49:41,406
124 Cease to be idle; cease to be unclean; cease

510
00:49:41,406 --> 00:49:46,806
 to find fault one with another; cease to sleep

511
00:49:46,806 --> 00:49:52,206
 longer than is needful; retire to thy bed early, that

512
00:49:52,206 --> 00:49:57,606
 ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies

513
00:49:57,606 --> 00:50:03,006
 and your minds may be invigorated

514
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:09,834
125 And above all things, clothe yourselves with

515
00:50:09,834 --> 00:50:16,167
 the bond of charity, as with a mantle, which is the

516
00:50:16,167 --> 00:50:22,499
 bond of perfectness and peace

517
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:29,269
126 Pray always, that ye may not faint, until I

518
00:50:29,269 --> 00:50:36,269
 come. Behold, and lo, I will come quickly, and

519
00:50:36,269 --> 00:50:43,269
 receive you unto myself. Amen

520
00:50:43,04 --> 00:50:47,897
127 And again, the order of the house prepared for

521
00:50:47,897 --> 00:50:52,754
 the presidency of the school of the prophets,

522
00:50:52,754 --> 00:50:57,611
 established for their instruction in all things that

523
00:50:57,611 --> 00:51:02,468
 are expedient for them, even for all the officers

524
00:51:02,468 --> 00:51:07,325
 of the church, or in other words, those who are

525
00:51:07,325 --> 00:51:12,182
 called to the ministry in the church, beginning at

526
00:51:12,182 --> 00:51:17,039
 the high priests, even down to the deacons

527
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:21,941
128 And this shall be the order of the house of

528
00:51:21,941 --> 00:51:26,341
 the presidency of the school: He that is appointed

529
00:51:26,341 --> 00:51:30,741
 to be president, or teacher, shall be found

530
00:51:30,741 --> 00:51:35,141
 standing in his place, in the house which shall be

531
00:51:35,141 --> 00:51:39,541
 prepared for him

532
00:51:39,53 --> 00:51:45,03
129 Therefore, he shall be first in the house of

533
00:51:45,03 --> 00:51:50,53
 God, in a place that the congregation in the house

534
00:51:50,53 --> 00:51:56,03
 may hear his words carefully and distinctly, not

535
00:51:56,03 --> 00:52:01,53
 with loud speech

536
00:52:01,518 --> 00:52:05,851
130 And when he cometh into the house of God, for

537
00:52:05,851 --> 00:52:10,184
 he should be first in the house—behold, this is

538
00:52:10,184 --> 00:52:14,517
 beautiful, that he may be an example

539
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:17,048
131 Let him offer himself in prayer upon his knees

540
00:52:17,048 --> 00:52:20,048
 before God, in token or remembrance of the

541
00:52:20,048 --> 00:52:23,048
 everlasting covenant

542
00:52:23,824 --> 00:52:29,574
132 And when any shall come in after him, let the

543
00:52:29,574 --> 00:52:35,324
 teacher arise, and, with uplifted hands to heaven,

544
00:52:35,324 --> 00:52:41,074
 yea, even directly, salute his brother or

545
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:46,824
 brethren with these words

546
00:52:46,33 --> 00:52:51,774
133 Art thou a brother or brethren? I salute you

547
00:52:51,774 --> 00:52:57,218
 in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, in token or

548
00:52:57,218 --> 00:53:02,662
 remembrance of the everlasting covenant, in which

549
00:53:02,662 --> 00:53:08,106
 covenant I receive you to fellowship, in a

550
00:53:08,106 --> 00:53:13,55
 determination that is fixed, immovable, and unchangeable,

551
00:53:13,55 --> 00:53:18,994
 to be your friend and brother through the grace of

552
00:53:18,994 --> 00:53:24,438
 God in the bonds of love, to walk in all the

553
00:53:24,438 --> 00:53:29,882
 commandments of God blameless, in thanksgiving,

554
00:53:29,882 --> 00:53:35,326
 forever and ever. Amen

555
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:39,579
134 And he that is found unworthy of this

556
00:53:39,579 --> 00:53:43,579
 salutation shall not have place among you; for ye shall

557
00:53:43,579 --> 00:53:47,579
 not suffer that mine house shall be polluted by him

558
00:53:47,579 --> 00:53:51,579


559
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:56,562
135 And he that cometh in and is faithful before

560
00:53:56,562 --> 00:54:01,562
 me, and is a brother, or if they be brethren, they

561
00:54:01,562 --> 00:54:06,562
 shall salute the president or teacher with

562
00:54:06,562 --> 00:54:11,562
 uplifted hands to heaven, with this same prayer and

563
00:54:11,562 --> 00:54:16,562
 covenant, or by saying Amen, in token of the same

564
00:54:16,57 --> 00:54:21,57
136 Behold, verily, I say unto you, this is an

565
00:54:21,57 --> 00:54:26,57
 ensample unto you for a salutation to one another in

566
00:54:26,57 --> 00:54:31,57
 the house of God, in the school of the prophets

567
00:54:31,335 --> 00:54:36,668
137 And ye are called to do this by prayer and

568
00:54:36,668 --> 00:54:42,001
 thanksgiving, as the Spirit shall give utterance in

569
00:54:42,001 --> 00:54:47,334
 all your doings in the house of the Lord, in the

570
00:54:47,334 --> 00:54:52,667
 school of the prophets, that it may become a

571
00:54:52,667 --> 00:54:57,0
 sanctuary, a tabernacle of the Holy Spirit to your

572
00:54:57,0 --> 00:55:03,333
 edification

573
00:55:03,617 --> 00:55:08,284
138 And ye shall not receive any among you into

574
00:55:08,284 --> 00:55:12,951
 this school save he is clean from the blood of this

575
00:55:12,951 --> 00:55:17,618
 generation

576
00:55:17,381 --> 00:55:22,048
139 And he shall be received by the ordinance of

577
00:55:22,048 --> 00:55:26,715
 the washing of feet, for unto this end was the

578
00:55:26,715 --> 00:55:31,382
 ordinance of the washing of feet instituted

579
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:36,329
140 And again, the ordinance of washing feet is to

580
00:55:36,329 --> 00:55:40,996
 be administered by the president, or presiding

581
00:55:40,996 --> 00:55:45,663
 elder of the church

582
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:56,092
141 It is to be commenced with prayer; and after

583
00:55:56,092 --> 00:56:06,759
 partaking of bread and wine, he is to gird himself

584
00:56:06,759 --> 00:56:17,426
 according to the pattern given in the
