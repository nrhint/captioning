Section 128 An epistle from Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Prophet to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Saints, containing further directions on baptism

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
for the dead, dated at Nauvoo, Illinois, September

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
6, 1842. 
1–5, Local and general recorders must

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
certify to the fact of baptisms for the dead;

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
6–9, Their records are binding and recorded on

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
earth and in heaven; 
10–14, The baptismal font is a

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
similitude of the grave; 
15–17, Elijah restored

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
power relative to baptism for the dead; 
18–21,

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
All of the keys, powers, and authorities of past

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
dispensations have been restored; 
22–25, Glad and

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
glorious tidings are acclaimed for the living

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and the dead. 
Revelation 20:12—And I saw the dead,

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
small and great, stand before God; and the books

16
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
were opened; and another book was opened, which

17
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
is the book of life; and the dead were judged out

18
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of those things which were written in the books,

19
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
according to their works.
Matthew 16:18, 19: And

20
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and

21
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
upon this rock I will build my church; and the

22
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I

23
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of

24
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall

25
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt

26
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
loose on earth shall be loosed in

27
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
heaven.
1 Corinthians 15:46, 47, and 48:
1 Corinthians 15:29: Else

28
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
what shall they do which are baptized for the

29
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
dead, if the dead rise not at all? Why are they

30
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
then baptized for the dead?
last chapter, verses 5th

31
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and 6th: Behold, I will send you Elijah the

32
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful

33
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
day of the Lord: And he shall turn the heart of

34
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the fathers to the children, and the heart of the

35
00:00:00,0 --> 01:40:53,
children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.

36
01:40:53,0 --> 01:40:53,0
1 As I stated to you in my letter before I left

37
01:40:53,0 --> 01:40:53,0
my place, that I would write to you from time to

38
01:40:53,0 --> 01:40:53,0
time and give you information in relation to

39
01:40:53,0 --> 01:40:53,0
many subjects, I now resume the subject of the

40
01:40:53,0 --> 01:40:53,0
baptism for the dead, as that subject seems to

41
01:40:53,0 --> 01:40:53,0
occupy my mind, and press itself upon my feelings

42
01:40:53,0 --> 01:40:31,
the strongest, since I have been pursued by my enemies.

43
01:40:31,0 --> 01:40:31,0
2 I wrote a few words of revelation to you

44
01:40:31,0 --> 01:40:31,0
concerning a recorder. I have had a few

45
01:40:31,0 --> 01:40:31,0
additional views in relation to this

46
01:40:31,0 --> 01:40:31,0
matter, which I now certify. That is, it was

47
01:40:31,0 --> 01:40:31,0
declared in my former letter that there

48
01:40:31,0 --> 01:40:31,0
should be a recorder, who should be

49
01:40:31,0 --> 01:40:31,0
eye-witness, and also to hear with his ears, that he

50
01:40:31,0 --> 01:36:11,
might make a record of a truth before the Lord.

51
01:36:11,0 --> 01:36:11,0
3 Now, in relation to this matter, it

52
01:36:11,0 --> 01:36:11,0
would be very difficult for one recorder

53
01:36:11,0 --> 01:36:11,0
to be present at all times, and to do all

54
01:36:11,0 --> 01:36:11,0
the business. To obviate this

55
01:36:11,0 --> 01:36:11,0
difficulty, there can be a recorder appointed in

56
01:36:11,0 --> 01:36:11,0
each ward of the city, who is well

57
01:36:11,0 --> 01:36:11,0
qualified for taking accurate minutes; and

58
01:36:11,0 --> 01:36:11,0
let him be very particular and precise in

59
01:36:11,0 --> 01:36:11,0
taking the whole proceedings, certifying

60
01:36:11,0 --> 01:36:11,0
in his record that he saw with his

61
01:36:11,0 --> 01:36:11,0
eyes, and heard with his ears, giving the

62
01:36:11,0 --> 01:36:11,0
date, and names, and so forth, and the

63
01:36:11,0 --> 01:36:11,0
history of the whole transaction; naming

64
01:36:11,0 --> 01:36:11,0
also some three individuals that are

65
01:36:11,0 --> 01:36:11,0
present, if there be any present, who can at

66
01:36:11,0 --> 01:36:11,0
any time when called upon certify to the

67
01:36:11,0 --> 01:36:11,0
same, that in the mouth of two or three

68
01:36:11,0 --> 01:41:16,
witnesses every word may be established.

69
01:41:16,0 --> 01:41:16,0
4 Then, let there be a general

70
01:41:16,0 --> 01:41:16,0
recorder, to whom these other records can be

71
01:41:16,0 --> 01:41:16,0
handed, being attended with certificates

72
01:41:16,0 --> 01:41:16,0
over their own signatures, certifying

73
01:41:16,0 --> 01:41:16,0
that the record they have made is true.

74
01:41:16,0 --> 01:41:16,0
Then the general church recorder can

75
01:41:16,0 --> 01:41:16,0
enter the record on the general church

76
01:41:16,0 --> 01:41:16,0
book, with the certificates and all the

77
01:41:16,0 --> 01:41:16,0
attending witnesses, with his own

78
01:41:16,0 --> 01:41:16,0
statement that he verily believes the above

79
01:41:16,0 --> 01:41:16,0
statement and records to be true, from

80
01:41:16,0 --> 01:41:16,0
his knowledge of the general character

81
01:41:16,0 --> 01:41:16,0
and appointment of those men by the

82
01:41:16,0 --> 01:41:16,0
church. And when this is done on the

83
01:41:16,0 --> 01:41:16,0
general church book, the record shall be just

84
01:41:16,0 --> 01:41:16,0
as holy, and shall answer the

85
01:41:16,0 --> 01:41:16,0
ordinance just the same as if he had seen with

86
01:41:16,0 --> 01:41:16,0
his eyes and heard with his ears, and

87
01:41:16,0 --> 01:40:54,
made a record of the same on the general church book.

88
01:40:54,0 --> 01:40:54,0
5 You may think this order of

89
01:40:54,0 --> 01:40:54,0
things to be very particular; but let me

90
01:40:54,0 --> 01:40:54,0
tell you that it is only to answer

91
01:40:54,0 --> 01:40:54,0
the will of God, by conforming to

92
01:40:54,0 --> 01:40:54,0
the ordinance and preparation that

93
01:40:54,0 --> 01:40:54,0
the Lord ordained and prepared

94
01:40:54,0 --> 01:40:54,0
before the foundation of the world, for

95
01:40:54,0 --> 01:40:54,0
the salvation of the dead who

96
01:40:54,0 --> 01:40:32,
should die without a knowledge of the gospel.

97
01:40:32,0 --> 01:40:32,0
6 And further, I want you to

98
01:40:32,0 --> 01:40:32,0
remember that John the Revelator was

99
01:40:32,0 --> 01:40:32,0
contemplating this very subject in

100
01:40:32,0 --> 01:40:32,0
relation to the dead, when he

101
01:40:32,0 --> 01:36:12,
declared, as you will find recorded in 

102
01:36:12,0 --> 01:36:12,0
7 You will discover in this

103
01:36:12,0 --> 01:36:12,0
quotation that the books were

104
01:36:12,0 --> 01:36:12,0
opened; and another book was opened,

105
01:36:12,0 --> 01:36:12,0
which was the book of life; but

106
01:36:12,0 --> 01:36:12,0
the dead were judged out of those

107
01:36:12,0 --> 01:36:12,0
things which were written in

108
01:36:12,0 --> 01:36:12,0
the books, according to their

109
01:36:12,0 --> 01:36:12,0
works; consequently, the books

110
01:36:12,0 --> 01:36:12,0
spoken of must be the books which

111
01:36:12,0 --> 01:36:12,0
contained the record of their

112
01:36:12,0 --> 01:36:12,0
works, and refer to the records which

113
01:36:12,0 --> 01:36:12,0
are kept on the earth. And the

114
01:36:12,0 --> 01:36:12,0
book which was the book of life

115
01:36:12,0 --> 01:36:12,0
is the record which is kept in

116
01:36:12,0 --> 01:36:12,0
heaven; the principle agreeing

117
01:36:12,0 --> 01:36:12,0
precisely with the doctrine which

118
01:36:12,0 --> 01:36:12,0
is commanded you in the

119
01:36:12,0 --> 01:36:12,0
revelation contained in the letter which

120
01:36:12,0 --> 01:36:12,0
I wrote to you previous to my

121
01:36:12,0 --> 01:36:12,0
leaving my place—that in all your

122
01:36:12,0 --> 01:41:17,
recordings it may be recorded in heaven.

123
01:41:17,0 --> 01:41:17,0
8 Now, the nature of this

124
01:41:17,0 --> 01:41:17,0
ordinance consists in the power of

125
01:41:17,0 --> 01:41:17,0
the priesthood, by the

126
01:41:17,0 --> 01:41:17,0
revelation of Jesus Christ, wherein

127
01:41:17,0 --> 01:41:17,0
it is granted that whatsoever

128
01:41:17,0 --> 01:41:17,0
you bind on earth shall be

129
01:41:17,0 --> 01:41:17,0
bound in heaven, and whatsoever

130
01:41:17,0 --> 01:41:17,0
you loose on earth shall be

131
01:41:17,0 --> 01:41:17,0
loosed in heaven. Or, in other

132
01:41:17,0 --> 01:41:17,0
words, taking a different view

133
01:41:17,0 --> 01:41:17,0
of the translation, whatsoever

134
01:41:17,0 --> 01:41:17,0
you record on earth shall be

135
01:41:17,0 --> 01:41:17,0
recorded in heaven, and

136
01:41:17,0 --> 01:41:17,0
whatsoever you do not record on earth

137
01:41:17,0 --> 01:41:17,0
shall not be recorded in

138
01:41:17,0 --> 01:41:17,0
heaven; for out of the books shall

139
01:41:17,0 --> 01:41:17,0
your dead be judged,

140
01:41:17,0 --> 01:41:17,0
according to their own works, whether

141
01:41:17,0 --> 01:41:17,0
they themselves have attended

142
01:41:17,0 --> 01:41:17,0
to the ordinances in their own

143
01:41:17,0 --> 01:41:17,0
propria persona, or by the

144
01:41:17,0 --> 01:41:17,0
means of their own agents,

145
01:41:17,0 --> 01:41:17,0
according to the ordinance which

146
01:41:17,0 --> 01:41:17,0
God has prepared for their

147
01:41:17,0 --> 01:41:17,0
salvation from before the

148
01:41:17,0 --> 01:41:17,0
foundation of the world, according to

149
01:41:17,0 --> 01:40:55,
the records which they have kept concerning their dead.

150
01:40:55,0 --> 01:40:55,0
9 It may seem to some to be a

151
01:40:55,0 --> 01:40:55,0
very bold doctrine that we

152
01:40:55,0 --> 01:40:55,0
talk of—a power which records

153
01:40:55,0 --> 01:40:55,0
or binds on earth and binds

154
01:40:55,0 --> 01:40:55,0
in heaven. Nevertheless, in

155
01:40:55,0 --> 01:40:55,0
all ages of the world, whenever

156
01:40:55,0 --> 01:40:55,0
the Lord has given a

157
01:40:55,0 --> 01:40:55,0
dispensation of the priesthood to

158
01:40:55,0 --> 01:40:55,0
any man by actual revelation,

159
01:40:55,0 --> 01:40:55,0
or any set of men, this power

160
01:40:55,0 --> 01:40:55,0
has always been given. Hence,

161
01:40:55,0 --> 01:40:55,0
whatsoever those men did in

162
01:40:55,0 --> 01:40:55,0
authority, in the name of the

163
01:40:55,0 --> 01:40:55,0
Lord, and did it truly and

164
01:40:55,0 --> 01:40:55,0
faithfully, and kept a proper

165
01:40:55,0 --> 01:40:55,0
and faithful record of the

166
01:40:55,0 --> 01:40:55,0
same, it became a law on earth

167
01:40:55,0 --> 01:40:55,0
and in heaven, and could not

168
01:40:55,0 --> 01:40:55,0
be annulled, according to the

169
01:40:55,0 --> 01:40:55,0
decrees of the great

170
01:40:55,0 --> 01:40:33,
Jehovah. This is a faithful saying. Who can hear it?

171
01:40:33,0 --> 01:40:33,0
10 And again,

172
01:40:33,0 --> 01:36:13,
for the precedent, 

173
01:36:13,0 --> 01:36:13,0
11 Now the

174
01:36:13,0 --> 01:36:13,0
great and grand

175
01:36:13,0 --> 01:36:13,0
secret of the

176
01:36:13,0 --> 01:36:13,0
whole matter, and

177
01:36:13,0 --> 01:36:13,0
the summum bonum

178
01:36:13,0 --> 01:36:13,0
of the whole

179
01:36:13,0 --> 01:36:13,0
subject that is

180
01:36:13,0 --> 01:36:13,0
lying before

181
01:36:13,0 --> 01:36:13,0
us, consists in

182
01:36:13,0 --> 01:36:13,0
obtaining the

183
01:36:13,0 --> 01:36:13,0
powers of the

184
01:36:13,0 --> 01:36:13,0
Holy Priesthood.

185
01:36:13,0 --> 01:36:13,0
For him to whom

186
01:36:13,0 --> 01:36:13,0
these keys are

187
01:36:13,0 --> 01:36:13,0
given there is

188
01:36:13,0 --> 01:36:13,0
no difficulty

189
01:36:13,0 --> 01:36:13,0
in obtaining a

190
01:36:13,0 --> 01:36:13,0
knowledge of

191
01:36:13,0 --> 01:36:13,0
facts in relation

192
01:36:13,0 --> 01:36:13,0
to the

193
01:36:13,0 --> 01:36:13,0
salvation of the

194
01:36:13,0 --> 01:36:13,0
children of men, both

195
01:36:13,0 --> 01:36:13,0
as well for

196
01:36:13,0 --> 01:41:18,
the dead as for the living.

197
01:41:18,0 --> 01:41:18,0
12 Herein is

198
01:41:18,0 --> 01:41:18,0
glory and

199
01:41:18,0 --> 01:41:18,0
honor, and

200
01:41:18,0 --> 01:41:18,0
immortality and

201
01:41:18,0 --> 01:41:18,0
eternal life—The

202
01:41:18,0 --> 01:41:18,0
ordinance of

203
01:41:18,0 --> 01:41:18,0
baptism by water,

204
01:41:18,0 --> 01:41:18,0
to be immersed

205
01:41:18,0 --> 01:41:18,0
therein in

206
01:41:18,0 --> 01:41:18,0
order to answer

207
01:41:18,0 --> 01:41:18,0
to the

208
01:41:18,0 --> 01:41:18,0
likeness of the dead,

209
01:41:18,0 --> 01:41:18,0
that one

210
01:41:18,0 --> 01:41:18,0
principle might

211
01:41:18,0 --> 01:41:18,0
accord with the

212
01:41:18,0 --> 01:41:18,0
other; to be

213
01:41:18,0 --> 01:41:18,0
immersed in the

214
01:41:18,0 --> 01:41:18,0
water and

215
01:41:18,0 --> 01:41:18,0
come forth out of

216
01:41:18,0 --> 01:41:18,0
the water is

217
01:41:18,0 --> 01:41:18,0
in the

218
01:41:18,0 --> 01:41:18,0
likeness of the

219
01:41:18,0 --> 01:41:18,0
resurrection of the

220
01:41:18,0 --> 01:41:18,0
dead in

221
01:41:18,0 --> 01:41:18,0
coming forth out of

222
01:41:18,0 --> 01:41:18,0
their graves;

223
01:41:18,0 --> 01:41:18,0
hence, this

224
01:41:18,0 --> 01:41:18,0
ordinance was

225
01:41:18,0 --> 01:41:18,0
instituted to

226
01:41:18,0 --> 01:41:18,0
form a

227
01:41:18,0 --> 01:41:18,0
relationship with the

228
01:41:18,0 --> 01:41:18,0
ordinance of

229
01:41:18,0 --> 01:41:18,0
baptism for the

230
01:41:18,0 --> 01:40:56,
dead, being in likeness of the dead.

231
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
13

232
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
Consequently, the

233
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
baptismal font was

234
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
instituted

235
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
as a

236
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
similitude of the

237
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
grave, and was

238
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
commanded to be

239
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
in a place

240
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
underneath

241
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
where the living

242
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
are wont to

243
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
assemble, to

244
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
show forth

245
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
the living and

246
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
the dead, and

247
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
that all

248
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
things may have

249
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
their

250
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
likeness, and that

251
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
they may

252
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
accord one with

253
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
another—that

254
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
which is

255
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
earthly conforming

256
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:56,0
to that which

257
01:40:56,0 --> 01:40:34,
is heavenly, as Paul hath declared, 

258
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
14 Howbeit

259
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
that was not

260
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
first which

261
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
is

262
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
spiritual, but that

263
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
which is

264
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
natural; and

265
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
afterward that

266
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
which is

267
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
spiritual. The

268
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
first man is

269
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
of the

270
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
earth, earthy;

271
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
the second

272
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
man is the

273
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
Lord from

274
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
heaven. As is the

275
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
earthy,

276
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
such are they

277
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
also that are

278
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
earthy; and

279
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
as is the

280
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
heavenly,

281
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
such are they

282
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
also that are

283
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
heavenly.

284
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
And as are

285
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
the records on

286
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
the earth

287
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
in relation

288
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
to your dead,

289
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
which are

290
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
truly made

291
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
out, so also

292
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
are the

293
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
records in

294
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
heaven. This,

295
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
therefore, is

296
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
the sealing

297
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
and binding

298
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
power, and, in

299
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
one sense

300
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
of the word,

301
01:40:34,0 --> 01:40:34,0
the keys of

302
01:40:34,0 --> 01:36:14,
the kingdom, which consist in the key of knowledge.

303
01:36:14,0 --> 01:36:14,0
15 And now,

304
01:36:14,0 --> 01:36:14,0
my dearly

305
01:36:14,0 --> 01:36:14,0
beloved

306
01:36:14,0 --> 01:36:14,0
brethren and

307
01:36:14,0 --> 01:36:14,0
sisters, let me

308
01:36:14,0 --> 01:36:14,0
assure you

309
01:36:14,0 --> 01:36:14,0
that these are

310
01:36:14,0 --> 01:36:14,0
principles

311
01:36:14,0 --> 01:36:14,0
in relation

312
01:36:14,0 --> 01:36:14,0
to the dead

313
01:36:14,0 --> 01:36:14,0
and the

314
01:36:14,0 --> 01:36:14,0
living that

315
01:36:14,0 --> 01:36:14,0
cannot be

316
01:36:14,0 --> 01:36:14,0
lightly passed

317
01:36:14,0 --> 01:36:14,0
over, as

318
01:36:14,0 --> 01:36:14,0
pertaining to our

319
01:36:14,0 --> 01:36:14,0
salvation.

320
01:36:14,0 --> 01:36:14,0
For their

321
01:36:14,0 --> 01:36:14,0
salvation is

322
01:36:14,0 --> 01:36:14,0
necessary and

323
01:36:14,0 --> 01:36:14,0
essential to

324
01:36:14,0 --> 01:36:14,0
our

325
01:36:14,0 --> 01:36:14,0
salvation, as Paul

326
01:36:14,0 --> 01:36:14,0
says

327
01:36:14,0 --> 01:36:14,0
concerning the

328
01:36:14,0 --> 01:36:14,0
fathers—that

329
01:36:14,0 --> 01:36:14,0
they without us

330
01:36:14,0 --> 01:36:14,0
cannot be

331
01:36:14,0 --> 01:36:14,0
made

332
01:36:14,0 --> 01:36:14,0
perfect—neither can

333
01:36:14,0 --> 01:36:14,0
we without

334
01:36:14,0 --> 01:36:14,0
our dead be

335
01:36:14,0 --> 01:41:19,
made perfect.

336
01:41:19,0 --> 01:41:19,0
16 And now,

337
01:41:19,0 --> 01:41:19,0
in relation

338
01:41:19,0 --> 01:41:19,0
to the

339
01:41:19,0 --> 01:41:19,0
baptism for the

340
01:41:19,0 --> 01:41:19,0
dead, I will

341
01:41:19,0 --> 01:41:19,0
give you

342
01:41:19,0 --> 01:41:19,0
another

343
01:41:19,0 --> 01:42:23,
quotation of Paul, 

344
01:42:23,0 --> 01:42:23,0
17 And

345
01:42:23,0 --> 01:42:23,0
again, in

346
01:42:23,0 --> 01:42:23,0
connection with

347
01:42:23,0 --> 01:42:23,0
this

348
01:42:23,0 --> 01:42:23,0
quotation I will

349
01:42:23,0 --> 01:42:23,0
give you a

350
01:42:23,0 --> 01:42:23,0
quotation

351
01:42:23,0 --> 01:42:23,0
from one of

352
01:42:23,0 --> 01:42:23,0
the

353
01:42:23,0 --> 01:42:23,0
prophets, who had

354
01:42:23,0 --> 01:42:23,0
his eye

355
01:42:23,0 --> 01:42:23,0
fixed on the

356
01:42:23,0 --> 01:42:23,0
restoration

357
01:42:23,0 --> 01:42:23,0
of the

358
01:42:23,0 --> 01:42:23,0
priesthood, the

359
01:42:23,0 --> 01:42:23,0
glories to

360
01:42:23,0 --> 01:42:23,0
be

361
01:42:23,0 --> 01:42:23,0
revealed in the

362
01:42:23,0 --> 01:42:23,0
last days,

363
01:42:23,0 --> 01:42:23,0
and in an

364
01:42:23,0 --> 01:42:23,0
especial

365
01:42:23,0 --> 01:42:23,0
manner this most

366
01:42:23,0 --> 01:42:23,0
glorious

367
01:42:23,0 --> 01:42:23,0
of all

368
01:42:23,0 --> 01:42:23,0
subjects

369
01:42:23,0 --> 01:42:23,0
belonging to the

370
01:42:23,0 --> 01:42:23,0
everlasting

371
01:42:23,0 --> 01:42:23,0
gospel,

372
01:42:23,0 --> 01:42:23,0
namely, the

373
01:42:23,0 --> 01:53:23,
baptism for the dead; for Malachi says, 

374
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
18 I might

375
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
have

376
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
rendered a

377
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
plainer

378
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
translation to

379
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
this, but

380
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
it is

381
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
sufficiently

382
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
plain to

383
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
suit my

384
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
purpose as it

385
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
stands. It

386
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
is

387
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
sufficient to

388
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
know, in

389
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
this case,

390
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
that the

391
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
earth will be

392
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
smitten

393
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
with a

394
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
curse unless

395
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
there is a

396
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
welding

397
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
link of some

398
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
kind or

399
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
other

400
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
between the

401
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
fathers and

402
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
the

403
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
children, upon

404
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
some subject

405
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
or

406
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
other—and behold

407
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
what is

408
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
that

409
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
subject? It is

410
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
the baptism

411
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
for the

412
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
dead. For

413
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
we without

414
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
them

415
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
cannot be made

416
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
perfect;

417
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
neither can

418
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
they

419
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
without us be

420
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
made

421
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
perfect.

422
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
Neither can they

423
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
nor we be

424
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
made

425
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
perfect

426
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
without those

427
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
who have

428
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
died in the

429
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
gospel

430
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
also; for it

431
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
is

432
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
necessary in the

433
01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0

01:53:23,0 --> 01:53:23,0
beginning to usher
