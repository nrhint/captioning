00:00:11,328 --> 00:00:13,928
Section 128 An epistle from Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:13,928 --> 00:00:16,528
 Prophet to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day

3
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:19,128
 Saints, containing further directions on baptism for

4
00:00:19,128 --> 00:00:21,728
 the dead, dated at Nauvoo, Illinois, September 6,

5
00:00:21,728 --> 00:00:24,328
 1842. 
1–5, Local and general recorders must

6
00:00:24,328 --> 00:00:26,928
 certify to the fact of baptisms for the dead; 
6–9,

7
00:00:26,928 --> 00:00:29,528
 Their records are binding and recorded on earth and

8
00:00:29,528 --> 00:00:32,128
 in heaven; 
10–14, The baptismal font is a

9
00:00:32,128 --> 00:00:34,728
 similitude of the grave; 
15–17, Elijah restored power

10
00:00:34,728 --> 00:00:37,328
 relative to baptism for the dead; 
18–21, All of the

11
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:39,928
 keys, powers, and authorities of past

12
00:00:39,928 --> 00:00:42,528
 dispensations have been restored; 
22–25, Glad and glorious

13
00:00:42,528 --> 00:00:45,128
 tidings are acclaimed for the living and the dead.

14
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,728
Revelation 20:12—And I saw the dead, small and

15
00:00:47,728 --> 00:00:50,328
 great, stand before God; and the books were opened;

16
00:00:50,328 --> 00:00:52,928
 and another book was opened, which is the book of

17
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:55,528
 life; and the dead were judged out of those things

18
00:00:55,528 --> 00:00:58,128
 which were written in the books, according to

19
00:00:58,128 --> 00:01:00,728
 their works.
Matthew 16:18, 19: And I say also unto

20
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:03,328
 thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will

21
00:01:03,328 --> 00:01:05,928
 build my church; and the gates of hell shall not

22
00:01:05,928 --> 00:01:08,528
 prevail against it. And I will give unto thee the

23
00:01:08,528 --> 00:01:11,128
 keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou

24
00:01:11,128 --> 00:01:13,728
 shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and

25
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:16,328
 whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be

26
00:01:16,328 --> 00:01:18,928
 loosed in heaven.
1 Corinthians 15:46, 47, and

27
00:01:18,928 --> 00:01:21,528
 48:
1 Corinthians 15:29: Else what shall they do which

28
00:01:21,528 --> 00:01:24,128
 are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at

29
00:01:24,128 --> 00:01:26,728
 all? Why are they then baptized for the dead?
last

30
00:01:26,728 --> 00:01:29,328
 chapter, verses 5th and 6th: Behold, I will send

31
00:01:29,328 --> 00:01:31,928
 you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the

32
00:01:31,928 --> 00:01:34,528
 great and dreadful day of the Lord: And he shall

33
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:37,128
 turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and

34
00:01:37,128 --> 00:01:39,728
 the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I

35
00:01:39,728 --> 00:01:42,328
 come and smite the earth with a curse

36
00:01:42,419 --> 00:01:46,99
1 As I stated to you in my letter before I left my

37
00:01:46,99 --> 00:01:51,561
 place, that I would write to you from time to

38
00:01:51,561 --> 00:01:56,132
 time and give you information in relation to many

39
00:01:56,132 --> 00:02:00,703
 subjects, I now resume the subject of the baptism for

40
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:05,274
 the dead, as that subject seems to occupy my

41
00:02:05,274 --> 00:02:09,845
 mind, and press itself upon my feelings the strongest,

42
00:02:09,845 --> 00:02:14,416
 since I have been pursued by my enemies

43
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:19,813
2 I wrote a few words of revelation to you

44
00:02:19,813 --> 00:02:25,242
 concerning a recorder. I have had a few additional views

45
00:02:25,242 --> 00:02:30,671
 in relation to this matter, which I now certify.

46
00:02:30,671 --> 00:02:36,1
 That is, it was declared in my former letter that

47
00:02:36,1 --> 00:02:41,529
 there should be a recorder, who should be

48
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:46,958
 eye-witness, and also to hear with his ears, that he might

49
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:52,387
 make a record of a truth before the Lord

50
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:58,106
3 Now, in relation to this matter, it would be

51
00:02:58,106 --> 00:03:03,573
 very difficult for one recorder to be present at all

52
00:03:03,573 --> 00:03:09,04
 times, and to do all the business. To obviate this

53
00:03:09,04 --> 00:03:14,507
 difficulty, there can be a recorder appointed in

54
00:03:14,507 --> 00:03:19,974
 each ward of the city, who is well qualified for

55
00:03:19,974 --> 00:03:25,441
 taking accurate minutes; and let him be very

56
00:03:25,441 --> 00:03:30,908
 particular and precise in taking the whole proceedings,

57
00:03:30,908 --> 00:03:36,375
 certifying in his record that he saw with his

58
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:41,842
 eyes, and heard with his ears, giving the date, and

59
00:03:41,842 --> 00:03:47,309
 names, and so forth, and the history of the whole

60
00:03:47,309 --> 00:03:52,776
 transaction; naming also some three individuals that

61
00:03:52,776 --> 00:03:58,243
 are present, if there be any present, who can at

62
00:03:58,243 --> 00:04:03,71
 any time when called upon certify to the same,

63
00:04:03,71 --> 00:04:09,177
 that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every

64
00:04:09,177 --> 00:04:14,644
 word may be established

65
00:04:14,571 --> 00:04:20,446
4 Then, let there be a general recorder, to whom

66
00:04:20,446 --> 00:04:26,321
 these other records can be handed, being attended

67
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:32,196
 with certificates over their own signatures,

68
00:04:32,196 --> 00:04:38,071
 certifying that the record they have made is true. Then

69
00:04:38,071 --> 00:04:43,946
 the general church recorder can enter the record

70
00:04:43,946 --> 00:04:49,821
 on the general church book, with the certificates

71
00:04:49,821 --> 00:04:55,696
 and all the attending witnesses, with his own

72
00:04:55,696 --> 00:05:01,571
 statement that he verily believes the above statement

73
00:05:01,571 --> 00:05:07,446
 and records to be true, from his knowledge of the

74
00:05:07,446 --> 00:05:13,321
 general character and appointment of those men by

75
00:05:13,321 --> 00:05:19,196
 the church. And when this is done on the general

76
00:05:19,196 --> 00:05:25,071
 church book, the record shall be just as holy, and

77
00:05:25,071 --> 00:05:30,946
 shall answer the ordinance just the same as if he

78
00:05:30,946 --> 00:05:36,821
 had seen with his eyes and heard with his ears, and

79
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:42,696
 made a record of the same on the general church

80
00:05:42,696 --> 00:05:48,571
 book

81
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:51,677
5 You may think this order of things to be very

82
00:05:51,677 --> 00:05:55,106
 particular; but let me tell you that it is only to

83
00:05:55,106 --> 00:05:58,535
 answer the will of God, by conforming to the

84
00:05:58,535 --> 00:06:01,964
 ordinance and preparation that the Lord ordained and

85
00:06:01,964 --> 00:06:05,393
 prepared before the foundation of the world, for the

86
00:06:05,393 --> 00:06:08,822
 salvation of the dead who should die without a

87
00:06:08,822 --> 00:06:12,251
 knowledge of the gospel

88
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:26,522
6 And further, I want you to remember that John

89
00:06:26,522 --> 00:06:40,272
 the Revelator was contemplating this very subject in

90
00:06:40,272 --> 00:06:54,022
 relation to the dead, when he declared, as you

91
00:06:54,022 --> 00:07:07,772
 will find recorded in

92
00:07:07,243 --> 00:07:11,886
7 You will discover in this quotation that the

93
00:07:11,886 --> 00:07:16,529
 books were opened; and another book was opened, which

94
00:07:16,529 --> 00:07:21,172
 was the book of life; but the dead were judged

95
00:07:21,172 --> 00:07:25,815
 out of those things which were written in the books,

96
00:07:25,815 --> 00:07:30,458
 according to their works; consequently, the books

97
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:35,101
 spoken of must be the books which contained the

98
00:07:35,101 --> 00:07:39,744
 record of their works, and refer to the records

99
00:07:39,744 --> 00:07:44,387
 which are kept on the earth. And the book which was

100
00:07:44,387 --> 00:07:49,03
 the book of life is the record which is kept in

101
00:07:49,03 --> 00:07:53,673
 heaven; the principle agreeing precisely with the

102
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:58,316
 doctrine which is commanded you in the revelation

103
00:07:58,316 --> 00:08:02,959
 contained in the letter which I wrote to you previous

104
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:07,602
 to my leaving my place—that in all your

105
00:08:07,602 --> 00:08:12,245
 recordings it may be recorded in heaven

106
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:18,9
8 Now, the nature of this ordinance consists in

107
00:08:18,9 --> 00:08:24,841
 the power of the priesthood, by the revelation of

108
00:08:24,841 --> 00:08:30,782
 Jesus Christ, wherein it is granted that whatsoever

109
00:08:30,782 --> 00:08:36,723
 you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and

110
00:08:36,723 --> 00:08:42,664
 whatsoever you loose on earth shall be loosed in

111
00:08:42,664 --> 00:08:48,605
 heaven. Or, in other words, taking a different view

112
00:08:48,605 --> 00:08:54,546
 of the translation, whatsoever you record on earth

113
00:08:54,546 --> 00:09:00,487
 shall be recorded in heaven, and whatsoever you do

114
00:09:00,487 --> 00:09:06,428
 not record on earth shall not be recorded in

115
00:09:06,428 --> 00:09:12,369
 heaven; for out of the books shall your dead be

116
00:09:12,369 --> 00:09:18,31
 judged, according to their own works, whether they

117
00:09:18,31 --> 00:09:24,251
 themselves have attended to the ordinances in their own

118
00:09:24,251 --> 00:09:30,192
 propria persona, or by the means of their own

119
00:09:30,192 --> 00:09:36,133
 agents, according to the ordinance which God has

120
00:09:36,133 --> 00:09:42,074
 prepared for their salvation from before the

121
00:09:42,074 --> 00:09:48,015
 foundation of the world, according to the records which

122
00:09:48,015 --> 00:09:53,956
 they have kept concerning their dead

123
00:09:53,893 --> 00:10:00,047
9 It may seem to some to be a very bold doctrine

124
00:10:00,047 --> 00:10:06,201
 that we talk of—a power which records or binds on

125
00:10:06,201 --> 00:10:12,355
 earth and binds in heaven. Nevertheless, in all

126
00:10:12,355 --> 00:10:18,509
 ages of the world, whenever the Lord has given a

127
00:10:18,509 --> 00:10:24,663
 dispensation of the priesthood to any man by actual

128
00:10:24,663 --> 00:10:30,817
 revelation, or any set of men, this power has always

129
00:10:30,817 --> 00:10:36,971
 been given. Hence, whatsoever those men did in

130
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:43,125
 authority, in the name of the Lord, and did it truly

131
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:49,279
 and faithfully, and kept a proper and faithful

132
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:55,433
 record of the same, it became a law on earth and in

133
00:10:55,433 --> 00:11:01,587
 heaven, and could not be annulled, according to

134
00:11:01,587 --> 00:11:07,741
 the decrees of the great Jehovah. This is a faithful

135
00:11:07,741 --> 00:11:13,895
 saying. Who can hear it

136
00:11:13,823 --> 00:12:00,823
10 And again, for the precedent,

137
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:04,319
11 Now the great and grand secret of the whole

138
00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:08,569
 matter, and the summum bonum of the whole subject

139
00:12:08,569 --> 00:12:12,819
 that is lying before us, consists in obtaining the

140
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:17,069
 powers of the Holy Priesthood. For him to whom these

141
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:21,319
 keys are given there is no difficulty in

142
00:12:21,319 --> 00:12:25,569
 obtaining a knowledge of facts in relation to the

143
00:12:25,569 --> 00:12:29,819
 salvation of the children of men, both as well for the

144
00:12:29,819 --> 00:12:34,069
 dead as for the living

145
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:38,537
12 Herein is glory and honor, and immortality and

146
00:12:38,537 --> 00:12:42,737
 eternal life—The ordinance of baptism by water, to

147
00:12:42,737 --> 00:12:46,937
 be immersed therein in order to answer to the

148
00:12:46,937 --> 00:12:51,137
 likeness of the dead, that one principle might accord

149
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:55,337
 with the other; to be immersed in the water and

150
00:12:55,337 --> 00:12:59,537
 come forth out of the water is in the likeness of

151
00:12:59,537 --> 00:13:03,737
 the resurrection of the dead in coming forth out of

152
00:13:03,737 --> 00:13:07,937
 their graves; hence, this ordinance was

153
00:13:07,937 --> 00:13:12,137
 instituted to form a relationship with the ordinance of

154
00:13:12,137 --> 00:13:16,337
 baptism for the dead, being in likeness of the dead

155
00:13:16,312 --> 00:13:22,437
13 Consequently, the baptismal font was instituted

156
00:13:22,437 --> 00:13:28,562
 as a similitude of the grave, and was commanded

157
00:13:28,562 --> 00:13:34,687
 to be in a place underneath where the living are

158
00:13:34,687 --> 00:13:40,812
 wont to assemble, to show forth the living and the

159
00:13:40,812 --> 00:13:46,937
 dead, and that all things may have their likeness,

160
00:13:46,937 --> 00:13:53,062
 and that they may accord one with another—that

161
00:13:53,062 --> 00:13:59,187
 which is earthly conforming to that which is

162
00:13:59,187 --> 00:14:05,312
 heavenly, as Paul hath declared,

163
00:14:05,561 --> 00:14:10,728
14 Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual,

164
00:14:10,728 --> 00:14:15,895
 but that which is natural; and afterward that

165
00:14:15,895 --> 00:14:21,062
 which is spiritual. The first man is of the earth,

166
00:14:21,062 --> 00:14:26,229
 earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven. As is

167
00:14:26,229 --> 00:14:31,396
 the earthy, such are they also that are earthy;

168
00:14:31,396 --> 00:14:36,563
 and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are

169
00:14:36,563 --> 00:14:41,73
 heavenly. And as are the records on the earth in

170
00:14:41,73 --> 00:14:46,897
 relation to your dead, which are truly made out,

171
00:14:46,897 --> 00:14:52,064
 so also are the records in heaven. This, therefore,

172
00:14:52,064 --> 00:14:57,231
 is the sealing and binding power, and, in one

173
00:14:57,231 --> 00:15:02,398
 sense of the word, the keys of the kingdom, which

174
00:15:02,398 --> 00:15:07,565
 consist in the key of knowledge

175
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:12,039
15 And now, my dearly beloved brethren and

176
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:17,039
 sisters, let me assure you that these are principles in

177
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:22,039
 relation to the dead and the living that cannot be

178
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:27,039
 lightly passed over, as pertaining to our

179
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:32,039
 salvation. For their salvation is necessary and essential

180
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:37,039
 to our salvation, as Paul says concerning the

181
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:42,039
 fathers—that they without us cannot be made

182
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:47,039
 perfect—neither can we without our dead be made perfect

183
00:15:47,797 --> 00:16:01,797
16 And now, in relation to the baptism for the

184
00:16:01,797 --> 00:16:15,797
 dead, I will give you another quotation of Paul,

185
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:24,166
17 And again, in connection with this quotation I

186
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:32,791
 will give you a quotation from one of the

187
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:41,416
 prophets, who had his eye fixed on the restoration of the

188
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:50,041
 priesthood, the glories to be revealed in the last

189
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:58,666
 days, and in an especial manner this most

190
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:07,291
 glorious of all subjects belonging to the everlasting

191
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:15,916
 gospel, namely, the baptism for the dead; for Malachi

192
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:24,541
 says,

193
00:17:24,26 --> 00:17:30,086
18 I might have rendered a plainer translation to

194
00:17:30,086 --> 00:17:35,912
 this, but it is sufficiently plain to suit my

195
00:17:35,912 --> 00:17:41,738
 purpose as it stands. It is sufficient to know, in

196
00:17:41,738 --> 00:17:47,564
 this case, that the earth will be smitten with a

197
00:17:47,564 --> 00:17:53,39
 curse unless there is a welding link of some kind or

198
00:17:53,39 --> 00:17:59,216
 other between the fathers and the children, upon

199
00:17:59,216 --> 00:18:05,042
 some subject or other—and behold what is that

200
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:10,868
 subject? It is the baptism for the dead. For we without

201
00:18:10,868 --> 00:18:16,694
 them cannot be made perfect; neither can they

202
00:18:16,694 --> 00:18:22,52
 without us be made perfect. Neither can they nor we be

203
00:18:22,52 --> 00:18:28,346
 made perfect without those who have died in the

204
00:18:28,346 --> 00:18:34,172
 gospel also; for it is necessary in the ushering in

205
00:18:34,172 --> 00:18:39,998
 of the dispensation of the fulness of times,

206
00:18:39,998 --> 00:18:45,824
 which dispensation is now beginning to usher in, that

207
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:51,65
 a whole and complete and perfect union, and

208
00:18:51,65 --> 00:18:57,476
 welding together of dispensations, and keys, and powers,

209
00:18:57,476 --> 00:19:03,302
 and glories should take place, and be revealed

210
00:19:03,302 --> 00:19:09,128
 from the days of Adam even to the present time. And

211
00:19:09,128 --> 00:19:14,954
 not only this, but those things which never have

212
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:20,78
 been revealed from the foundation of the world, but

213
00:19:20,78 --> 00:19:26,606
 have been kept hid from the wise and prudent,

214
00:19:26,606 --> 00:19:32,432
 shall be revealed unto babes and sucklings in this,

215
00:19:32,432 --> 00:19:38,258
 the dispensation of the fulness of times

216
00:19:38,661 --> 00:19:44,761
19 Now, what do we hear in the gospel which we

217
00:19:44,761 --> 00:19:50,861
 have received? A voice of gladness! A voice of mercy

218
00:19:50,861 --> 00:19:56,961
 from heaven; and a voice of truth out of the

219
00:19:56,961 --> 00:20:03,061
 earth; glad tidings for the dead; a voice of gladness

220
00:20:03,061 --> 00:20:09,161
 for the living and the dead; glad tidings of great

221
00:20:09,161 --> 00:20:15,261
 joy. How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet

222
00:20:15,261 --> 00:20:21,361
 of those that bring glad tidings of good things,

223
00:20:21,361 --> 00:20:27,461
 and that say unto Zion: Behold, thy God reigneth!

224
00:20:27,461 --> 00:20:33,561
 As the dews of Carmel, so shall the knowledge of

225
00:20:33,561 --> 00:20:39,661
 God descend upon them

226
00:20:39,021 --> 00:20:48,329
20 And again, what do we hear? Glad tidings from

227
00:20:48,329 --> 00:20:57,637
 Cumorah! Moroni, an angel from heaven, declaring

228
00:20:57,637 --> 00:21:06,945
 the fulfilment of the prophets—the book to be

229
00:21:06,945 --> 00:21:16,253
 revealed. A voice of the Lord in the wilderness of

230
00:21:16,253 --> 00:21:25,561
 Fayette, Seneca county, declaring the three witnesses

231
00:21:25,561 --> 00:21:34,869
 to bear record of the book! The voice of Michael on

232
00:21:34,869 --> 00:21:44,177
 the banks of the Susquehanna, detecting the devil

233
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:53,485
 when he appeared as an angel of light! The voice

234
00:21:53,485 --> 00:22:02,793
 of Peter, James, and John in the wilderness

235
00:22:02,793 --> 00:22:12,101
 between Harmony, Susquehanna county, and Colesville,

236
00:22:12,101 --> 00:22:21,409
 Broome county, on the Susquehanna river, declaring

237
00:22:21,409 --> 00:22:30,717
 themselves as possessing the keys of the kingdom,

238
00:22:30,717 --> 00:22:40,025
 and of the dispensation of the fulness of times

239
00:22:40,91 --> 00:22:47,839
21 And again, the voice of God in the chamber of

240
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:54,768
 old Father Whitmer, in Fayette, Seneca county, and

241
00:22:54,768 --> 00:23:01,697
 at sundry times, and in divers places through all

242
00:23:01,697 --> 00:23:08,626
 the travels and tribulations of this Church of

243
00:23:08,626 --> 00:23:15,555
 Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints! And the voice of

244
00:23:15,555 --> 00:23:22,484
 Michael, the archangel; the voice of Gabriel, and

245
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:29,413
 of Raphael, and of divers angels, from Michael or

246
00:23:29,413 --> 00:23:36,342
 Adam down to the present time, all declaring their

247
00:23:36,342 --> 00:23:43,271
 dispensation, their rights, their keys, their

248
00:23:43,271 --> 00:23:50,2
 honors, their majesty and glory, and the power of

249
00:23:50,2 --> 00:23:57,129
 their priesthood; giving line upon line, precept upon

250
00:23:57,129 --> 00:24:04,058
 precept; here a little, and there a little; giving

251
00:24:04,058 --> 00:24:10,987
 us consolation by holding forth that which is to

252
00:24:10,987 --> 00:24:17,916
 come, confirming our hope

253
00:24:17,84 --> 00:24:23,618
22 Brethren, shall we not go on in so great a

254
00:24:23,618 --> 00:24:29,396
 cause? Go forward and not backward. Courage, brethren;

255
00:24:29,396 --> 00:24:35,174
 and on, on to the victory! Let your hearts

256
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:40,952
 rejoice, and be exceedingly glad. Let the earth break

257
00:24:40,952 --> 00:24:46,73
 forth into singing. Let the dead speak forth anthems

258
00:24:46,73 --> 00:24:52,508
 of eternal praise to the King Immanuel, who hath

259
00:24:52,508 --> 00:24:58,286
 ordained, before the world was, that which would

260
00:24:58,286 --> 00:25:04,064
 enable us to redeem them out of their prison; for

261
00:25:04,064 --> 00:25:09,842
 the prisoners shall go free

262
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:15,877
23 Let the mountains shout for joy, and all ye

263
00:25:15,877 --> 00:25:22,663
 valleys cry aloud; and all ye seas and dry lands tell

264
00:25:22,663 --> 00:25:29,449
 the wonders of your Eternal King! And ye rivers,

265
00:25:29,449 --> 00:25:36,235
 and brooks, and rills, flow down with gladness.

266
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:43,021
 Let the woods and all the trees of the field praise

267
00:25:43,021 --> 00:25:49,807
 the Lord; and ye solid rocks weep for joy! And let

268
00:25:49,807 --> 00:25:56,593
 the sun, moon, and the morning stars sing

269
00:25:56,593 --> 00:26:03,379
 together, and let all the sons of God shout for joy! And

270
00:26:03,379 --> 00:26:10,165
 let the eternal creations declare his name forever

271
00:26:10,165 --> 00:26:16,951
 and ever! And again I say, how glorious is the

272
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:23,737
 voice we hear from heaven, proclaiming in our ears,

273
00:26:23,737 --> 00:26:30,523
 glory, and salvation, and honor, and immortality,

274
00:26:30,523 --> 00:26:37,309
 and eternal life; kingdoms, principalities, and

275
00:26:37,309 --> 00:26:44,095
 powers

276
00:26:44,987 --> 00:26:51,449
24 Behold, the great day of the Lord is at hand;

277
00:26:51,449 --> 00:26:57,911
 and who can abide the day of his coming, and who

278
00:26:57,911 --> 00:27:04,373
 can stand when he appeareth? For he is like a

279
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:10,835
 refiner’s fire, and like fuller’s soap; and he shall sit

280
00:27:10,835 --> 00:27:17,297
 as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he shall

281
00:27:17,297 --> 00:27:23,759
 purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold

282
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:30,221
 and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an

283
00:27:30,221 --> 00:27:36,683
 offering in righteousness. Let us, therefore, as a

284
00:27:36,683 --> 00:27:43,145
 church and a people, and as Latter-day Saints,

285
00:27:43,145 --> 00:27:49,607
 offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness; and

286
00:27:49,607 --> 00:27:56,069
 let us present in his holy temple, when it is

287
00:27:56,069 --> 00:28:02,531
 finished, a book containing the records of our dead,

288
00:28:02,531 --> 00:28:08,993
 which shall be worthy of all acceptation

289
00:28:08,42 --> 00:28:13,82
25 Brethren, I have many things to say to you on

290
00:28:13,82 --> 00:28:19,22
 the subject; but shall now close for the present,

291
00:28:19,22 --> 00:28:24,62
 and continue the subject another time. I am, as

292
00:28:24,62 --> 00:28:30,02
 ever, your humble servant and never deviating

293
00:28:30,02 --> 00:28:35,42
 friend,Joseph Smith.
