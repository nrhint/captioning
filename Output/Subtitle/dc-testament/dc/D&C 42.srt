36
03:49:28,0 --> 03:49:28,0
you, I give unto you this first

45
04:00:29,0 --> 04:19:28,
Spirit when they shall return.

04:19:28,0 --> 04:19:28,0
the power of my Spirit,

48
04:19:28,0 --> 04:19:28,0
preaching my gospel, two by

49
04:19:28,0 --> 04:19:28,0
two, in my name, lifting up

50
04:19:28,0 --> 04:19:28,0
your voices as with the

51
04:19:28,0 --> 04:19:28,0
sound of a trump, declaring my

52
04:19:28,0 --> 04:29:31,
word like unto angels of God.

repent ye, for the

57
04:29:31,0 --> 04:52:32,
kingdom of heaven is at hand.

58
04:52:32,0 --> 04:52:32,0
8 And from this place

59
04:52:32,0 --> 04:52:32,0
ye shall go forth

60
04:52:32,0 --> 04:52:32,0
into the regions

61
04:52:32,0 --> 04:52:32,0
westward; and inasmuch as

62
04:52:32,0 --> 04:52:32,0
ye shall find them

63
04:52:32,0 --> 04:52:32,0
that will receive you ye

64
04:52:32,0 --> 04:52:32,0
shall build up my

65
04:52:32,0 --> 05:06:36,
church in every region—

66
05:06:36,0 --> 05:06:36,0
9 Until the time

67
05:06:36,0 --> 05:06:36,0
shall come when it

68
05:06:36,0 --> 05:06:36,0
shall be revealed

69
05:06:36,0 --> 05:06:36,0
unto you from on high,

70
05:06:36,0 --> 05:06:36,0
when the city of

71
05:06:36,0 --> 05:06:36,0
the New Jerusalem

72
05:06:36,0 --> 05:06:36,0
shall be prepared,

73
05:06:36,0 --> 05:06:36,0
that ye may be

74
05:06:36,0 --> 05:06:36,0
gathered in one, that ye

75
05:06:36,0 --> 05:06:36,0
may be my people

76
05:06:36,0 --> 05:08:40,
and I will be your God.

77
05:08:40,0 --> 05:08:40,0
10 And again, I

78
05:08:40,0 --> 05:08:40,0
say unto you, that

79
05:08:40,0 --> 05:08:40,0
my servant Edward

80
05:08:40,0 --> 05:08:40,0
Partridge shall

81
05:08:40,0 --> 05:08:40,0
stand in the office

82
05:08:40,0 --> 05:08:40,0
whereunto I have

83
05:08:40,0 --> 05:08:40,0
appointed him. And

84
05:08:40,0 --> 05:08:40,0
it shall come to

85
05:08:40,0 --> 05:08:40,0
pass, that if he

86
05:08:40,0 --> 05:08:40,0
transgress another

87
05:08:40,0 --> 05:08:40,0
shall be appointed

88
05:08:40,0 --> 05:23:41,
in his stead. Even so. Amen.

89
05:23:41,0 --> 05:23:41,0
11 Again I say

90
05:23:41,0 --> 05:23:41,0
unto you, that it

91
05:23:41,0 --> 05:23:41,0
shall not be given

92
05:23:41,0 --> 05:23:41,0
to any one to go

93
05:23:41,0 --> 05:23:41,0
forth to preach

94
05:23:41,0 --> 05:23:41,0
my gospel, or to

95
05:23:41,0 --> 05:23:41,0
build up my

96
05:23:41,0 --> 05:23:41,0
church, except he be

97
05:23:41,0 --> 05:23:41,0

one who has

99
05:23:41,0 --> 05:23:41,0
authority, and it is

100
05:23:41,0 --> 05:23:41,0
known to the church

101
05:23:41,0 --> 05:23:41,0
that he has

102
05:23:41,0 --> 05:23:41,0
authority and has

103
05:23:41,0 --> 05:23:41,0
been regularly

104
05:23:41,0 --> 05:23:19,
ordained by the heads of the church.

105
05:23:19,0 --> 05:23:19,0
12 And again,

106
05:23:19,0 --> 05:23:19,0
the elders,

107
05:23:19,0 --> 05:23:19,0
priests and teachers

108
05:23:19,0 --> 05:23:19,0
of this church

109
05:23:19,0 --> 05:23:19,0
shall teach the

110
05:23:19,0 --> 05:23:19,0
principles of my

111
05:23:19,0 --> 05:23:19,0
gospel, which are

112

and if ye

163
06:23:39,0 --> 06:42:38,
Father and of the Son.

164
06:42:38,0 --> 06:42:38,0
18 And

06:42:38,0 --> 06:42:38,0
now,

166
06:42:38,0 --> 06:42:38,0
behold, I speak

167
06:42:38,0 --> 06:42:38,0
unto the

168
06:42:38,0 --> 06:42:38,0
church.

169
06:42:38,0 --> 06:42:38,0
Thou

170
06:42:38,0 --> 06:42:38,0
shalt not

171
06:42:38,0 --> 06:42:38,0

173
06:42:38,0 --> 06:42:38,0
kills shall

174
06:42:38,0 --> 06:42:38,0
not have

175
06:42:38,0 --> 06:42:38,0


176
06:42:38,0 --> 06:42:38,0
forgiveness in
