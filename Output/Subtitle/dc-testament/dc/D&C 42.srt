1 Hearken, O ye elders of my church, who have

23
00:03:27,685 --> 00:03:33,285
 assembled yourselves together in my name, even Jesus

24
00:03:33,285 --> 00:03:38,885
 Christ the Son of the living God, the Savior of the

25
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:44,485
 world; inasmuch as ye believe on my name and keep

26
00:03:44,485 --> 00:03:50,085
 my commandments

27
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:56,097
2 Again I say unto you, hearken and hear and obey

28
00:03:56,097 --> 00:04:01,597
 the law which I shall give unto you

29
00:04:01,124 --> 00:04:06,924
3 For verily I say, as ye have assembled

30
00:04:06,924 --> 00:04:12,724
 yourselves together according to the commandment wherewith

31
00:04:12,724 --> 00:04:18,524
 I commanded you, and are agreed as touching this

32
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:24,324
 one thing, and have asked the Father in my name,

33
00:04:24,324 --> 00:04:30,124
 even so ye shall receive

34
00:04:30,387 --> 00:04:36,387
4 Behold, verily I say unto you, I give unto you

35
00:04:36,387 --> 00:04:42,387
 this first commandment, that ye shall go forth in

36
00:04:42,387 --> 00:04:48,387
 my name, every one of you, excepting my servants

37
00:04:48,387 --> 00:04:54,387
 Joseph Smith, Jun., and Sidney Rigdon

38
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:58,111
5 And I give unto them a commandment that they

39
00:04:58,111 --> 00:05:01,861
 shall go forth for a little season, and it shall be

40
00:05:01,861 --> 00:05:05,611
 given by the power of the Spirit when they shall

41
00:05:05,611 --> 00:05:09,361
 return

42
00:05:09,86 --> 00:05:17,61
6 And ye shall go forth in the power of my Spirit,

43
00:05:17,61 --> 00:05:25,36
 preaching my gospel, two by two, in my name,

44
00:05:25,36 --> 00:05:33,11
 lifting up your voices as with the sound of a trump,

45
00:05:33,11 --> 00:05:40,86
 declaring my word like unto angels of God

46
00:05:40,891 --> 00:05:47,224
7 And ye shall go forth baptizing with water,

47
00:05:47,224 --> 00:05:53,557
 saying: Repent ye, repent ye, for the kingdom of

48
00:05:53,557 --> 00:05:59,89
 heaven is at hand

49
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:06,393
8 And from this place ye shall go forth into the

50
00:06:06,393 --> 00:06:12,893
 regions westward; and inasmuch as ye shall find

51
00:06:12,893 --> 00:06:19,393
 them that will receive you ye shall build up my

52
00:06:19,393 --> 00:06:25,893
 church in every region

53
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:31,185
9 Until the time shall come when it shall be

54
00:06:31,185 --> 00:06:37,185
 revealed unto you from on high, when the city of the

55
00:06:37,185 --> 00:06:43,185
 New Jerusalem shall be prepared, that ye may be

56
00:06:43,185 --> 00:06:49,185
 gathered in one, that ye may be my people and I will

57
00:06:49,185 --> 00:06:55,185
 be your God

58
00:06:55,165 --> 00:07:00,165
10 And again, I say unto you, that my servant

59
00:07:00,165 --> 00:07:05,165
 Edward Partridge shall stand in the office whereunto I

60
00:07:05,165 --> 00:07:10,165
 have appointed him. And it shall come to pass,

61
00:07:10,165 --> 00:07:15,165
 that if he transgress another shall be appointed in

62
00:07:15,165 --> 00:07:20,165
 his stead. Even so. Amen

63
00:07:20,44 --> 00:07:25,94
11 Again I say unto you, that it shall not be

64
00:07:25,94 --> 00:07:31,44
 given to any one to go forth to preach my gospel, or

65
00:07:31,44 --> 00:07:36,94
 to build up my church, except he be ordained by

66
00:07:36,94 --> 00:07:42,44
 some one who has authority, and it is known to the

67
00:07:42,44 --> 00:07:47,94
 church that he has authority and has been regularly

68
00:07:47,94 --> 00:07:53,44
 ordained by the heads of the church

69
00:07:53,957 --> 00:07:59,707
12 And again, the elders, priests and teachers of

70
00:07:59,707 --> 00:08:05,457
 this church shall teach the principles of my

71
00:08:05,457 --> 00:08:11,207
 gospel, which are in the Bible and the Book of Mormon,

72
00:08:11,207 --> 00:08:16,957
 in the which is the fulness of the gospel

73
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:23,13
13 And they shall observe the covenants and church

74
00:08:23,13 --> 00:08:29,797
 articles to do them, and these shall be their

75
00:08:29,797 --> 00:08:36,464
 teachings, as they shall be directed by the Spirit

76
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:41,782
14 And the Spirit shall be given unto you by the

77
00:08:41,782 --> 00:08:47,115
 prayer of faith; and if ye receive not the Spirit

78
00:08:47,115 --> 00:08:52,448
 ye shall not teach

79
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:58,432
15 And all this ye shall observe to do as I have

80
00:08:58,432 --> 00:09:04,432
 commanded concerning your teaching, until the

81
00:09:04,432 --> 00:09:10,432
 fulness of my scriptures is given

82
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:15,05
16 And as ye shall lift up your voices by the

83
00:09:15,05 --> 00:09:19,383
 Comforter, ye shall speak and prophesy as seemeth me

84
00:09:19,383 --> 00:09:23,716
 good

85
00:09:23,246 --> 00:09:29,746
17 For, behold, the Comforter knoweth all things,

86
00:09:29,746 --> 00:09:36,246
 and beareth record of the Father and of the Son

87
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:41,009
18 And now, behold, I speak unto the church. Thou

88
00:09:41,009 --> 00:09:45,759
 shalt not kill; and he that kills shall not have

89
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:50,509
 forgiveness in this world, nor in the world to

90
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:55,259
 come

91
00:09:55,028 --> 00:10:01,528
19 And again, I say, thou shalt not kill; but he

92
00:10:01,528 --> 00:10:08,028
 that killeth shall die

93
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:13,808
20 Thou shalt not steal; and he that stealeth and

94
00:10:13,808 --> 00:10:19,308
 will not repent shall be cast out

95
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:24,085
21 Thou shalt not lie; he that lieth and will not

96
00:10:24,085 --> 00:10:29,085
 repent shall be cast out

97
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:35,379
22 Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart,

98
00:10:35,379 --> 00:10:41,379
 and shalt cleave unto her and none else

99
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:46,174
23 And he that looketh upon a woman to lust after

100
00:10:46,174 --> 00:10:50,674
 her shall deny the faith, and shall not have the

101
00:10:50,674 --> 00:10:55,174
 Spirit; and if he repents not he shall be cast out

102
00:10:55,174 --> 00:10:59,674


103
00:10:59,676 --> 00:11:04,343
24 Thou shalt not commit adultery; and he that

104
00:11:04,343 --> 00:11:09,01
 committeth adultery, and repenteth not, shall be cast

105
00:11:09,01 --> 00:11:13,677
 out

106
00:11:13,723 --> 00:11:18,39
25 But he that has committed adultery and repents

107
00:11:18,39 --> 00:11:23,057
 with all his heart, and forsaketh it, and doeth it

108
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:27,724
 no more, thou shalt forgive

109
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:33,254
26 But if he doeth it again, he shall not be

110
00:11:33,254 --> 00:11:38,754
 forgiven, but shall be cast out

111
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:44,531
27 Thou shalt not speak evil of thy neighbor, nor

112
00:11:44,531 --> 00:11:50,531
 do him any harm

113
00:11:50,526 --> 00:11:56,526
28 Thou knowest my laws concerning these things

114
00:11:56,526 --> 00:12:02,526
 are given in my scriptures; he that sinneth and

115
00:12:02,526 --> 00:12:08,526
 repenteth not shall be cast out

116
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:14,294
29 If thou lovest me thou shalt serve me and keep

117
00:12:14,294 --> 00:12:20,294
 all my commandments

118
00:12:20,59 --> 00:12:27,09
30 And behold, thou wilt remember the poor, and

119
00:12:27,09 --> 00:12:33,59
 consecrate of thy properties for their support that

120
00:12:33,59 --> 00:12:40,09
 which thou hast to impart unto them, with a

121
00:12:40,09 --> 00:12:46,59
 covenant and a deed which cannot be broken

122
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:51,866
31 And inasmuch as ye impart of your substance

123
00:12:51,866 --> 00:12:56,866
 unto the poor, ye will do it unto me; and they shall

124
00:12:56,866 --> 00:13:01,866
 be laid before the bishop of my church and his

125
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:06,866
 counselors, two of the elders, or high priests, such

126
00:13:06,866 --> 00:13:11,866
 as he shall appoint or has appointed and set apart

127
00:13:11,866 --> 00:13:16,866
 for that purpose

128
00:13:16,913 --> 00:13:23,246
32 And it shall come to pass, that after they are

129
00:13:23,246 --> 00:13:29,579
 laid before the bishop of my church, and after

130
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:35,912
 that he has received these testimonies concerning the

131
00:13:35,912 --> 00:13:42,245
 consecration of the properties of my church, that

132
00:13:42,245 --> 00:13:48,578
 they cannot be taken from the church, agreeable

133
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:54,911
 to my commandments, every man shall be made

134
00:13:54,911 --> 00:14:01,244
 accountable unto me, a steward over his own property, or

135
00:14:01,244 --> 00:14:07,577
 that which he has received by consecration, as

136
00:14:07,577 --> 00:14:13,91
 much as is sufficient for himself and family

137
00:14:13,403 --> 00:14:20,028
33 And again, if there shall be properties in the

138
00:14:20,028 --> 00:14:26,653
 hands of the church, or any individuals of it,

139
00:14:26,653 --> 00:14:33,278
 more than is necessary for their support after this

140
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:39,903
 first consecration, which is a residue to be

141
00:14:39,903 --> 00:14:46,528
 consecrated unto the bishop, it shall be kept to

142
00:14:46,528 --> 00:14:53,153
 administer to those who have not, from time to time, that

143
00:14:53,153 --> 00:14:59,778
 every man who has need may be amply supplied and

144
00:14:59,778 --> 00:15:06,403
 receive according to his wants

145
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,889
34 Therefore, the residue shall be kept in my

146
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:17,139
 storehouse, to administer to the poor and the needy,

147
00:15:17,139 --> 00:15:22,389
 as shall be appointed by the high council of the

148
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:27,639
 church, and the bishop and his council

149
00:15:27,643 --> 00:15:39,643
35 And for the purpose of purchasing lands for the

150
00:15:39,643 --> 00:15:51,643
 public benefit of the church, and building houses

151
00:15:51,643 --> 00:16:03,643
 of worship, and building up of the New Jerusalem

152
00:16:03,643 --> 00:16:15,643
 which is hereafter to be revealed

153
00:16:15,591 --> 00:16:15,591
36 That my covenant people may be gathered in one

154
00:16:15,591 --> 00:16:15,591
 in that day when I shall come to my temple. And

155
00:16:15,591 --> 00:16:15,591
 this I do for the salvation of my people

156
00:16:15,925 --> 00:16:20,525
37 And it shall come to pass, that he that sinneth

157
00:16:20,525 --> 00:16:25,125
 and repenteth not shall be cast out of the

158
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:29,725
 church, and shall not receive again that which he has

159
00:16:29,725 --> 00:16:34,325
 consecrated unto the poor and the needy of my

160
00:16:34,325 --> 00:16:38,925
 church, or in other words, unto me

161
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:45,915
38 For inasmuch as ye do it unto the least of

162
00:16:45,915 --> 00:16:52,915
 these, ye do it unto me

163
00:16:52,695 --> 00:17:00,695
39 For it shall come to pass, that which I spake

164
00:17:00,695 --> 00:17:08,695
 by the mouths of my prophets shall be fulfilled;

165
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:16,695
 for I will consecrate of the riches of those who

166
00:17:16,695 --> 00:17:24,695
 embrace my gospel among the Gentiles unto the poor of

167
00:17:24,695 --> 00:17:32,695
 my people who are of the house of Israel

168
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:36,985
40 And again, thou shalt not be proud in thy

169
00:17:36,985 --> 00:17:41,318
 heart; let all thy garments be plain, and their beauty

170
00:17:41,318 --> 00:17:45,651
 the beauty of the work of thine own hands

171
00:17:45,181 --> 00:17:47,681
41 And let all things be done in cleanliness

172
00:17:47,681 --> 00:17:50,181
 before me

173
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:57,036
42 Thou shalt not be idle; for he that is idle

174
00:17:57,036 --> 00:18:03,369
 shall not eat the bread nor wear the garments of the

175
00:18:03,369 --> 00:18:09,702
 laborer

176
00:18:09,705 --> 00:18:16,455
43 And whosoever among you are sick, and have not

177
00:18:16,455 --> 00:18:23,205
 faith to be healed, but believe, shall be

178
00:18:23,205 --> 00:18:29,955
 nourished with all tenderness, with herbs and mild food,

179
00:18:29,955 --> 00:18:36,705
 and that not by the hand of an enemy

180
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:41,015
44 And the elders of the church, two or more,

181
00:18:41,015 --> 00:18:45,815
 shall be called, and shall pray for and lay their

182
00:18:45,815 --> 00:18:50,615
 hands upon them in my name; and if they die they shall

183
00:18:50,615 --> 00:18:55,415
 die unto me, and if they live they shall live

184
00:18:55,415 --> 00:19:00,215
 unto me

185
00:19:00,756 --> 00:19:08,756
45 Thou shalt live together in love, insomuch that

186
00:19:08,756 --> 00:19:16,756
 thou shalt weep for the loss of them that die,

187
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:24,756
 and more especially for those that have not hope of

188
00:19:24,756 --> 00:19:32,756
 a glorious resurrection

189
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:36,671
46 And it shall come to pass that those that die

190
00:19:36,671 --> 00:19:41,338
 in me shall not taste of death, for it shall be

191
00:19:41,338 --> 00:19:46,005
 sweet unto them

192
00:19:46,001 --> 00:19:51,501
47 And they that die not in me, wo unto them, for

193
00:19:51,501 --> 00:19:57,001
 their death is bitter

194
00:19:57,012 --> 00:20:02,012
48 And again, it shall come to pass that he that

195
00:20:02,012 --> 00:20:07,012
 hath faith in me to be healed, and is not appointed

196
00:20:07,012 --> 00:20:12,012
 unto death, shall be healed

197
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:19,511
49 He who hath faith to see shall see

198
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:26,785
50 He who hath faith to hear shall hear

199
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:37,559
51 The lame who hath faith to leap shall leap

200
00:20:37,853 --> 00:20:44,853
52 And they who have not faith to do these things,

201
00:20:44,853 --> 00:20:51,853
 but believe in me, have power to become my sons;

202
00:20:51,853 --> 00:20:58,853
 and inasmuch as they break not my laws thou shalt

203
00:20:58,853 --> 00:21:05,853
 bear their infirmities

204
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:10,865
53 Thou shalt stand in the place of thy

205
00:21:10,865 --> 00:21:15,865
 stewardship

206
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:20,308
54 Thou shalt not take thy brother’s garment; thou

207
00:21:20,308 --> 00:21:24,975
 shalt pay for that which thou shalt receive of

208
00:21:24,975 --> 00:21:29,642
 thy brother

209
00:21:29,171 --> 00:21:34,171
55 And if thou obtainest more than that which

210
00:21:34,171 --> 00:21:39,171
 would be for thy support, thou shalt give it into my

211
00:21:39,171 --> 00:21:44,171
 storehouse, that all things may be done according

212
00:21:44,171 --> 00:21:49,171
 to that which I have said

213
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:53,791
56 Thou shalt ask, and my scriptures shall be

214
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:58,124
 given as I have appointed, and they shall be preserved

215
00:21:58,124 --> 00:22:02,457
 in safety

216
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:07,254
57 And it is expedient that thou shouldst hold thy

217
00:22:07,254 --> 00:22:12,254
 peace concerning them, and not teach them until

218
00:22:12,254 --> 00:22:17,254
 ye have received them in full

219
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:23,003
58 And I give unto you a commandment that then ye

220
00:22:23,003 --> 00:22:28,253
 shall teach them unto all men; for they shall be

221
00:22:28,253 --> 00:22:33,503
 taught unto all nations, kindreds, tongues and

222
00:22:33,503 --> 00:22:38,753
 people

223
00:22:38,04 --> 00:22:45,707
59 Thou shalt take the things which thou hast

224
00:22:45,707 --> 00:22:53,374
 received, which have been given unto thee in my

225
00:22:53,374 --> 00:23:01,041
 scriptures for a law, to be my law to govern my church

226
00:23:01,03 --> 00:23:06,363
60 And he that doeth according to these things

227
00:23:06,363 --> 00:23:11,696
 shall be saved, and he that doeth them not shall be

228
00:23:11,696 --> 00:23:17,029
 damned if he so continue

229
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:24,213
61 If thou shalt ask, thou shalt receive

230
00:23:24,213 --> 00:23:30,613
 revelation upon revelation, knowledge upon knowledge, that

231
00:23:30,613 --> 00:23:37,013
 thou mayest know the mysteries and peaceable

232
00:23:37,013 --> 00:23:43,413
 things—that which bringeth joy, that which bringeth

233
00:23:43,413 --> 00:23:49,813
 life eternal

234
00:23:49,295 --> 00:23:53,962
62 Thou shalt ask, and it shall be revealed unto

235
00:23:53,962 --> 00:23:58,629
 you in mine own due time where the New Jerusalem

236
00:23:58,629 --> 00:24:03,296
 shall be built

237
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:10,142
63 And behold, it shall come to pass that my

238
00:24:10,142 --> 00:24:16,475
 servants shall be sent forth to the east and to the

239
00:24:16,475 --> 00:24:22,808
 west, to the north and to the south

240
00:24:22,344 --> 00:24:28,844
64 And even now, let him that goeth to the east

241
00:24:28,844 --> 00:24:35,344
 teach them that shall be converted to flee to the

242
00:24:35,344 --> 00:24:41,844
 west, and this in consequence of that which is

243
00:24:41,844 --> 00:24:48,344
 coming on the earth, and of secret combinations

244
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:55,653
65 Behold, thou shalt observe all these things,

245
00:24:55,653 --> 00:25:03,153
 and great shall be thy reward; for unto you it is

246
00:25:03,153 --> 00:25:10,653
 given to know the mysteries of the kingdom, but unto

247
00:25:10,653 --> 00:25:18,153
 the world it is not given to know them

248
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:23,917
66 Ye shall observe the laws which ye have

249
00:25:23,917 --> 00:25:29,417
 received and be faithful

250
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:35,695
67 And ye shall hereafter receive church

251
00:25:35,695 --> 00:25:41,695
 covenants, such as shall be sufficient to establish you,

252
00:25:41,695 --> 00:25:47,695
 both here and in the New Jerusalem

253
00:25:47,98 --> 00:25:52,647
68 Therefore, he that lacketh wisdom, let him ask

254
00:25:52,647 --> 00:25:57,314
 of me, and I will give him liberally and upbraid

255
00:25:57,314 --> 00:26:01,981
 him not

256
00:26:01,744 --> 00:26:09,077
69 Lift up your hearts and rejoice, for unto you

257
00:26:09,077 --> 00:26:16,41
 the kingdom, or in other words, the keys of the

258
00:26:16,41 --> 00:26:23,743
 church have been given. Even so. Amen

259
00:26:23,265 --> 00:26:29,765
70 The priests and teachers shall have their

260
00:26:29,765 --> 00:26:36,265
 stewardships, even as the members

261
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:43,779
71 And the elders or high priests who are

262
00:26:43,779 --> 00:26:50,779
 appointed to assist the bishop as counselors in all

263
00:26:50,779 --> 00:26:57,779
 things, are to have their families supported out of the

264
00:26:57,779 --> 00:27:04,779
 property which is consecrated to the bishop, for

265
00:27:04,779 --> 00:27:11,779
 the good of the poor, and for other purposes, as

266
00:27:11,779 --> 00:27:18,779
 before mentioned

267
00:27:18,27 --> 00:27:24,02
72 Or they are to receive a just remuneration for

268
00:27:24,02 --> 00:27:29,77
 all their services, either a stewardship or

269
00:27:29,77 --> 00:27:35,52
 otherwise, as may be thought best or decided by the

270
00:27:35,52 --> 00:27:41,27
 counselors and bishop

271
00:27:41,76 --> 00:27:47,093
73 And the bishop, also, shall receive his

272
00:27:47,093 --> 00:27:52,426
 support, or a just remuneration for all his services in

273
00:27:52,426 --> 00:27:57,759
 the church

274
00:27:57,025 --> 00:28:02,858
74 Behold, verily I say unto you, that whatever

275
00:28:02,858 --> 00:28:08,691
 persons among you, having put away their companions

276
00:28:08,691 --> 00:28:14,524
 for the cause of fornication, or in other words,

277
00:28:14,524 --> 00:28:20,357
 if they shall testify before you in all lowliness

278
00:28:20,357 --> 00:28:26,19
 of heart that this is the case, ye shall not cast

279
00:28:26,19 --> 00:28:32,023
 them out from among you

280
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:37,677
75 But if ye shall find that any persons have left

281
00:28:37,677 --> 00:28:43,077
 their companions for the sake of adultery, and

282
00:28:43,077 --> 00:28:48,477
 they themselves are the offenders, and their

283
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:53,877
 companions are living, they shall be cast out from among

284
00:28:53,877 --> 00:28:59,277
 you

285
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:07,704
76 And again, I say unto you, that ye shall be

286
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:16,371
 watchful and careful, with all inquiry, that ye

287
00:29:16,371 --> 00:29:25,038
 receive none such among you if they are married

288
00:29:25,547 --> 00:29:32,547
77 And if they are not married, they shall repent

289
00:29:32,547 --> 00:29:39,547
 of all their sins or ye shall not receive them

290
00:29:39,828 --> 00:29:45,828
78 And again, every person who belongeth to this

291
00:29:45,828 --> 00:29:51,828
 church of Christ, shall observe to keep all the

292
00:29:51,828 --> 00:29:57,828
 commandments and covenants of the church

293
00:29:57,112 --> 00:30:02,512
79 And it shall come to pass, that if any persons

294
00:30:02,512 --> 00:30:07,912
 among you shall kill they shall be delivered up

295
00:30:07,912 --> 00:30:13,312
 and dealt with according to the laws of the land;

296
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:18,712
 for remember that he hath no forgiveness; and it

297
00:30:18,712 --> 00:30:24,112
 shall be proved according to the laws of the land

298
00:30:24,373 --> 00:30:30,04
80 And if any man or woman shall commit adultery,

299
00:30:30,04 --> 00:30:35,707
 he or she shall be tried before two elders of the

300
00:30:35,707 --> 00:30:41,374
 church, or more, and every word shall be

301
00:30:41,374 --> 00:30:47,041
 established against him or her by two witnesses of the

302
00:30:47,041 --> 00:30:52,708
 church, and not of the enemy; but if there are more

303
00:30:52,708 --> 00:30:58,375
 than two witnesses it is better

304
00:30:58,123 --> 00:31:03,723
81 But he or she shall be condemned by the mouth

305
00:31:03,723 --> 00:31:09,323
 of two witnesses; and the elders shall lay the case

306
00:31:09,323 --> 00:31:14,923
 before the church, and the church shall lift up

307
00:31:14,923 --> 00:31:20,523
 their hands against him or her, that they may be

308
00:31:20,523 --> 00:31:26,123
 dealt with according to the law of God

309
00:31:26,101 --> 00:31:29,601
82 And if it can be, it is necessary that the

310
00:31:29,601 --> 00:31:33,101
 bishop be present also

311
00:31:33,158 --> 00:31:40,658
83 And thus ye shall do in all cases which shall

312
00:31:40,658 --> 00:31:48,158
 come before you

313
00:31:48,423 --> 00:31:53,423
84 And if a man or woman shall rob, he or she

314
00:31:53,423 --> 00:31:58,423
 shall be delivered up unto the law of the land

315
00:31:58,2 --> 00:32:01,7
85 And if he or she shall steal, he or she shall

316
00:32:01,7 --> 00:32:05,2
 be delivered up unto the law of the land

317
00:32:05,707 --> 00:32:09,707
86 And if he or she shall lie, he or she shall be

318
00:32:09,707 --> 00:32:13,707
 delivered up unto the law of the land

319
00:32:13,465 --> 00:32:17,132
87 And if he or she do any manner of iniquity, he

320
00:32:17,132 --> 00:32:20,799
 or she shall be delivered up unto the law, even

321
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:24,466
 that of God

322
00:32:24,743 --> 00:32:28,993
88 And if thy brother or sister offend thee, thou

323
00:32:28,993 --> 00:32:33,243
 shalt take him or her between him or her and thee

324
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:37,493
 alone; and if he or she confess thou shalt be

325
00:32:37,493 --> 00:32:41,743
 reconciled

326
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:51,526
89 And if he or she confess not thou shalt deliver

327
00:32:51,526 --> 00:33:01,526
 him or her up unto the church, not to the

328
00:33:01,526 --> 00:33:11,526
 members, but to the elders. And it shall be done in a

329
00:33:11,526 --> 00:33:21,526
 meeting, and that not before the world

330
00:33:21,483 --> 00:33:21,483
90 And if thy brother or sister offend many, he or

331
00:33:21,483 --> 00:33:21,483
 she shall be chastened before many

332
00:33:21,816 --> 00:33:25,316
91 And if any one offend openly, he or she shall

333
00:33:25,316 --> 00:33:28,816
 be rebuked openly, that he or she may be ashamed.

334
00:33:28,816 --> 00:33:32,316
 And if he or she confess not, he or she shall be

335
00:33:32,316 --> 00:33:35,816
 delivered up unto the law of God

336
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:40,947
92 If any shall offend in secret, he or she shall

337
00:33:40,947 --> 00:33:46,547
 be rebuked in secret, that he or she may have

338
00:33:46,547 --> 00:33:52,147
 opportunity to confess in secret to him or her whom he

339
00:33:52,147 --> 00:33:57,747
 or she has offended, and to God, that the church

340
00:33:57,747 --> 00:34:03,347
 may not speak reproachfully of him or her

341
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:11,278
verses 1 through 72, was received in the presence

342
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:11,278
 of twelve elders and in fulfillment of the Lord’s

343
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:11,278
 promise previously made that the “law” would be

344
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:11,278
 given in Ohio (see 
section 38:32). The second

345
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:11,278
 portion consists of

346
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:07,744
Section 42 Revelation given in two parts through

347
00:00:07,744 --> 00:00:04,077
 Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio,

348
00:00:04,077 --> 00:00:00,41
 February 9 and 23, 1831. The first part, consisting of
