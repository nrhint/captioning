11
00:01:18,367 --> 00:01:23,7

00:01:43,5 --> 00:01:46,0
 pattern which I have given unto you

17
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:51,44
3 And let the first lot on the south be

18
00:01:51,44 --> 00:01:56,107
 consecrated unto me for the building of a house for the

19
00:01:56,107 --> 00:02:00,774

23
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:19,367
4 Verily I say unto you, that it shall be built

24
00:02:19,367 --> 00:02:24,7
 fifty-five by sixty-five feet in the width thereof

25
00:02:24,7 --> 00:02:30,033
 and in the length thereof, in the inner court

26
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:33,017

28
00:02:36,017 --> 00:02:39,017

29
00:02:39,543 --> 00:02:43,293
6 And it shall be dedicated unto the Lord from the

30
00:02:43,293 --> 00:02:47,043
 foundation thereof, according to the order of the

31
00:02:47,043 --> 00:02:50,793

35
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:09,685
8 And ye shall not suffer any unclean thing to

36
00:03:09,685 --> 00:03:14,018
 come in unto it; and my glory shall be there, and my

37
00:03:14,018 --> 00:03:18,351
 presence shall be there

38
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:22,131
9 But if there shall come into it any unclean

39
00:03:22,131 --> 00:03:26,131
 thing, my glory shall not be there; and my presence

40
00:03:26,131 --> 00:03:30,131
 shall not come into it

41
00:03:30,16 --> 00:03:34,96
10 And again, verily I say unto you, the second

42
00:03:34,96 --> 00:03:39,76
 lot on the south shall be dedicated unto me for the

43
00:03:39,76 --> 00:03:44,56

44
00:03:44,56 --> 00:03:49,36

45
00:03:49,36 --> 00:03:54,16

46
00:03:54,684 --> 00:03:58,684
11 And it shall be fifty-five by sixty-five feet

47
00:03:58,684 --> 00:04:02,684

12 And this house shall be wholly dedicated unto

51
00:04:14,434 --> 00:04:18,434
 the Lord from the foundation thereof, for the work

52
00:04:18,434 --> 00:04:22,434
 of the printing, in all things whatsoever I shall

53
00:04:22,434 --> 00:04:26,434
 command you, to be holy, undefiled, according to

54
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:30,434
 the pattern in all things as it shall be given unto

55
00:04:30,434 --> 00:04:34,434
 you

56
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:40,458
13 And on the third lot shall my servant Hyrum

57
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:45,958
 Smith receive his inheritance

58
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:50,818
14 And on the first and second lots on the north

59
00:04:50,818 --> 00:04:56,151
 shall my servants Reynolds Cahoon and Jared Carter

60
00:04:56,151 --> 00:05:01,484
 receive their inheritances

61
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:05,218
15 That they may do the work which I have

62
00:05:05,218 --> 00:05:08,968
 appointed unto them, to be a committee to build mine

63
00:05:08,968 --> 00:05:12,718
 houses, according to the commandment, which I, the Lord

64
00:05:12,718 --> 00:05:16,468
 God, have given unto you

65
00:05:16,967 --> 00:05:22,967
16 These two houses are not to be built until I

66
00:05:22,967 --> 00:05:28,967
 give unto you a commandment concerning them

67
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:32,962
17 And now I give unto you no more at this time.

68
00:05:32,962 --> 00:05:36,962
 Amen.
