1
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:17,925
Section 59 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:17,925 --> 00:00:24,572
 the Prophet, in Zion, Jackson County, Missouri,

3
00:00:24,572 --> 00:00:31,219
 August 7, 1831. Preceding this revelation, the land

4
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:37,866
 was consecrated, as the Lord had directed, and the

5
00:00:37,866 --> 00:00:44,513
 site for the future temple was dedicated. On the

6
00:00:44,513 --> 00:00:51,16
 day this revelation was received, Polly Knight, the

7
00:00:51,16 --> 00:00:57,807
 wife of Joseph Knight Sr., died, the first Church

8
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:04,454
 member to die in Zion. Early members

9
00:01:04,454 --> 00:01:11,101
 characterized this revelation as “instructing the Saints how

10
00:01:11,101 --> 00:01:17,748
 to keep the sabbath and how to fast and pray.”

11
00:01:17,748 --> 00:01:24,395
1–4, The faithful Saints in Zion will be blessed;

12
00:01:24,395 --> 00:01:31,042
5–8, They are to love and serve the Lord and keep

13
00:01:31,042 --> 00:01:37,689
 His commandments; 
9–19, By keeping the Lord’s day

14
00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:44,336
 holy, the Saints are blessed temporally and

15
00:01:44,336 --> 00:01:50,983
 spiritually; 
20–24, The righteous are promised peace in

16
00:01:50,983 --> 00:01:57,63
 this world and eternal life in the world to come.

17
00:01:57,63 --> 00:02:04,277


18
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:10,358
1 Behold, blessed, saith the Lord, are they who

19
00:02:10,358 --> 00:02:16,025
 have come up unto this land with an eye single to my

20
00:02:16,025 --> 00:02:21,692
 glory, according to my commandments

21
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:28,674
2 For those that live shall inherit the earth, and

22
00:02:28,674 --> 00:02:36,074
 those that die shall rest from all their labors,

23
00:02:36,074 --> 00:02:43,474
 and their works shall follow them; and they shall

24
00:02:43,474 --> 00:02:50,874
 receive a crown in the mansions of my Father,

25
00:02:50,874 --> 00:02:58,274
 which I have prepared for them

26
00:02:58,245 --> 00:03:11,045
3 Yea, blessed are they whose feet stand upon the

27
00:03:11,045 --> 00:03:23,845
 land of Zion, who have obeyed my gospel; for they

28
00:03:23,845 --> 00:03:36,645
 shall receive for their reward the good things of

29
00:03:36,645 --> 00:03:49,445
 the earth, and it shall bring forth in its

30
00:03:49,445 --> 00:04:02,245
 strength

31
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:02,042
4 And they shall also be crowned with blessings

32
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:02,042
 from above, yea, and with commandments not a few,

33
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:02,042
 and with revelations in their time—they that are

34
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:02,042
 faithful and diligent before me

35
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:06,676
5 Wherefore, I give unto them a commandment,

36
00:04:06,676 --> 00:04:10,876
 saying thus: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all

37
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:15,076
 thy heart, with all thy might, mind, and strength;

38
00:04:15,076 --> 00:04:19,276
 and in the name of Jesus Christ thou shalt serve

39
00:04:19,276 --> 00:04:23,476
 him

40
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:29,13
6 Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. Thou

41
00:04:29,13 --> 00:04:34,797
 shalt not steal; neither commit adultery, nor kill,

42
00:04:34,797 --> 00:04:40,464
 nor do anything like unto it

43
00:04:40,48 --> 00:04:43,98
7 Thou shalt thank the Lord thy God in all things

44
00:04:43,98 --> 00:04:47,48


45
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:53,154
8 Thou shalt offer a sacrifice unto the Lord thy

46
00:04:53,154 --> 00:04:58,821
 God in righteousness, even that of a broken heart

47
00:04:58,821 --> 00:05:04,488
 and a contrite spirit

48
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:10,555
9 And that thou mayest more fully keep thyself

49
00:05:10,555 --> 00:05:16,305
 unspotted from the world, thou shalt go to the house

50
00:05:16,305 --> 00:05:22,055
 of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy

51
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:27,805
 day

52
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:32,961
10 For verily this is a day appointed unto you to

53
00:05:32,961 --> 00:05:38,628
 rest from your labors, and to pay thy devotions

54
00:05:38,628 --> 00:05:44,295
 unto the Most High

55
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:49,811
11 Nevertheless thy vows shall be offered up in

56
00:05:49,811 --> 00:05:55,311
 righteousness on all days and at all times

57
00:05:55,822 --> 00:06:01,822
12 But remember that on this, the Lord’s day, thou

58
00:06:01,822 --> 00:06:07,822
 shalt offer thine oblations and thy sacraments

59
00:06:07,822 --> 00:06:13,822
 unto the Most High, confessing thy sins unto thy

60
00:06:13,822 --> 00:06:19,822
 brethren, and before the Lord

61
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:25,313
13 And on this day thou shalt do none other thing,

62
00:06:25,313 --> 00:06:30,813
 only let thy food be prepared with singleness of

63
00:06:30,813 --> 00:06:36,313
 heart that thy fasting may be perfect, or, in

64
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:41,813
 other words, that thy joy may be full

65
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:47,067
14 Verily, this is fasting and prayer, or in other

66
00:06:47,067 --> 00:06:53,067
 words, rejoicing and prayer

67
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:59,597
15 And inasmuch as ye do these things with

68
00:06:59,597 --> 00:07:05,347
 thanksgiving, with cheerful hearts and countenances, not

69
00:07:05,347 --> 00:07:11,097
 with much laughter, for this is sin, but with a

70
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:16,847
 glad heart and a cheerful countenance

71
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:23,102
16 Verily I say, that inasmuch as ye do this, the

72
00:07:23,102 --> 00:07:30,102
 fulness of the earth is yours, the beasts of the

73
00:07:30,102 --> 00:07:37,102
 field and the fowls of the air, and that which

74
00:07:37,102 --> 00:07:44,102
 climbeth upon the trees and walketh upon the earth

75
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:50,114
17 Yea, and the herb, and the good things which

76
00:07:50,114 --> 00:07:55,864
 come of the earth, whether for food or for raiment,

77
00:07:55,864 --> 00:08:01,614
 or for houses, or for barns, or for orchards, or

78
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:07,364
 for gardens, or for vineyards

79
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:14,587
18 Yea, all things which come of the earth, in the

80
00:08:14,587 --> 00:08:22,087
 season thereof, are made for the benefit and the

81
00:08:22,087 --> 00:08:29,587
 use of man, both to please the eye and to gladden

82
00:08:29,587 --> 00:08:37,087
 the heart

83
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:42,017
19 Yea, for food and for raiment, for taste and

84
00:08:42,017 --> 00:08:47,017
 for smell, to strengthen the body and to enliven the

85
00:08:47,017 --> 00:08:52,017
 soul

86
00:08:52,999 --> 00:09:00,499
20 And it pleaseth God that he hath given all

87
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:07,999
 these things unto man; for unto this end were they

88
00:09:07,999 --> 00:09:15,499
 made to be used, with judgment, not to excess,

89
00:09:15,499 --> 00:09:22,999
 neither by extortion

90
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:28,812
21 And in nothing doth man offend God, or against

91
00:09:28,812 --> 00:09:35,062
 none is his wrath kindled, save those who confess

92
00:09:35,062 --> 00:09:41,312
 not his hand in all things, and obey not his

93
00:09:41,312 --> 00:09:47,562
 commandments

94
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:52,221
22 Behold, this is according to the law and the

95
00:09:52,221 --> 00:09:56,888
 prophets; wherefore, trouble me no more concerning

96
00:09:56,888 --> 00:10:01,555
 this matter

97
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:08,235
23 But learn that he who doeth the works of

98
00:10:08,235 --> 00:10:14,902
 righteousness shall receive his reward, even peace in

99
00:10:14,902 --> 00:10:21,569
 this world, and eternal life in the world to come

100
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:27,121
24 I, the Lord, have spoken it, and the Spirit

101
00:10:27,121 --> 00:10:32,621
 beareth record. Amen.
