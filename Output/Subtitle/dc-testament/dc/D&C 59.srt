00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:02,25
Section 59 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:02,25 --> 00:00:04,5
the Prophet, in Zion, Jackson County, Missouri,

3
00:00:04,5 --> 00:00:06,75
August 7, 1831. Preceding this revelation, the land

4
00:00:06,75 --> 00:00:09,0
was consecrated, as the Lord had directed, and the

5
00:00:09,0 --> 00:00:11,25
site for the future temple was dedicated. On the

6
00:00:11,25 --> 00:00:13,5
day this revelation was received, Polly Knight, the

7
00:00:13,5 --> 00:00:15,75
wife of Joseph Knight Sr., died, the first Church

8
00:00:15,75 --> 00:00:18,0
member to die in Zion. Early members

9
00:00:18,0 --> 00:00:20,25
characterized this revelation as “instructing the Saints how

10
00:00:20,25 --> 00:00:22,5
to keep the sabbath and how to fast and pray.”

11
00:00:22,5 --> 00:00:24,75
1–4, The faithful Saints in Zion will be blessed;

12
00:00:24,75 --> 00:00:27,0
5–8, They are to love and serve the Lord and keep

13
00:00:27,0 --> 00:00:29,25
His commandments; 
9–19, By keeping the Lord’s day

14
00:00:29,25 --> 00:00:31,5
holy, the Saints are blessed temporally and

15
00:00:31,5 --> 00:00:33,75
spiritually; 
20–24, The righteous are promised peace in

16
00:00:33,75 --> 00:00:36,27
this world and eternal life in the world to come. 

17
00:00:36,27 --> 00:00:48,27
1 Behold, blessed, saith the Lord, are they

18
00:00:48,27 --> 00:01:00,27
who have come up unto this land with an eye

19
00:01:00,27 --> 00:01:12,539
single to my glory, according to my commandments.

20
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:20,872
2 For those that live shall inherit

21
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:29,205
the earth, and those that die shall

22
00:01:29,205 --> 00:01:37,538
rest from all their labors, and their

23
00:01:37,538 --> 00:01:45,871
works shall follow them; and they

24
00:01:45,871 --> 00:01:54,204
shall receive a crown in the mansions of

25
00:01:54,204 --> 00:02:02,789
my Father, which I have prepared for them.

26
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,122
3 Yea, blessed are they whose

27
00:02:05,122 --> 00:02:07,455
feet stand upon the land of Zion,

28
00:02:07,455 --> 00:02:09,788
who have obeyed my gospel; for they

29
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:12,121
shall receive for their reward

30
00:02:12,121 --> 00:02:14,454
the good things of the earth, and

31
00:02:14,454 --> 00:02:16,169
it shall bring forth in its strength.

32
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:16,836
4 And they shall also be

33
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:17,503
crowned with blessings from

34
00:02:17,503 --> 00:02:18,17
above, yea, and with commandments

35
00:02:18,17 --> 00:02:18,837
not a few, and with

36
00:02:18,837 --> 00:02:19,504
revelations in their time—they that

37
00:02:19,504 --> 00:02:20,574
are faithful and diligent before me.

38
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:25,074
5 Wherefore, I give unto

39
00:02:25,074 --> 00:02:29,574
them a commandment,

40
00:02:29,574 --> 00:02:34,074
saying thus: Thou shalt love

41
00:02:34,074 --> 00:02:38,574
the Lord thy God with all

42
00:02:38,574 --> 00:02:43,074
thy heart, with all thy

43
00:02:43,074 --> 00:02:47,574
might, mind, and strength;

44
00:02:47,574 --> 00:02:52,074
and in the name of Jesus

45
00:02:52,074 --> 00:02:56,877
Christ thou shalt serve him.

46
00:02:56,877 --> 00:03:00,877
6 Thou shalt love thy

47
00:03:00,877 --> 00:03:04,877
neighbor as thyself.

48
00:03:04,877 --> 00:03:08,877
Thou shalt not

49
00:03:08,877 --> 00:03:12,877
steal; neither commit

50
00:03:12,877 --> 00:03:16,877
adultery, nor kill, nor

51
00:03:16,877 --> 00:03:20,801
do anything like unto it.

52
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:21,801
7 Thou shalt

53
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:22,801
thank the Lord thy

54
00:03:22,801 --> 00:03:23,203
God in all things.

55
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:27,328
8 Thou shalt

56
00:03:27,328 --> 00:03:31,453
offer a sacrifice

57
00:03:31,453 --> 00:03:35,578
unto the Lord

58
00:03:35,578 --> 00:03:39,703
thy God in

59
00:03:39,703 --> 00:03:43,828
righteousness, even

60
00:03:43,828 --> 00:03:47,953
that of a

61
00:03:47,953 --> 00:03:52,078
broken heart and a

62
00:03:52,078 --> 00:03:56,57
contrite spirit.

63
00:03:56,57 --> 00:03:58,752
9 And that

64
00:03:58,752 --> 00:04:00,934
thou mayest more

65
00:04:00,934 --> 00:04:03,116
fully keep

66
00:04:03,116 --> 00:04:05,298
thyself unspotted

67
00:04:05,298 --> 00:04:07,48
from the

68
00:04:07,48 --> 00:04:09,662
world, thou shalt

69
00:04:09,662 --> 00:04:11,844
go to the

70
00:04:11,844 --> 00:04:14,026
house of prayer

71
00:04:14,026 --> 00:04:16,208
and offer up thy

72
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,39
sacraments

73
00:04:18,39 --> 00:04:20,927
upon my holy day;

74
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,816
10 For verily

75
00:04:22,816 --> 00:04:24,705
this is a

76
00:04:24,705 --> 00:04:26,594
day appointed

77
00:04:26,594 --> 00:04:28,483
unto you to

78
00:04:28,483 --> 00:04:30,372
rest from your

79
00:04:30,372 --> 00:04:32,261
labors, and

80
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:34,15
to pay thy

81
00:04:34,15 --> 00:04:36,039
devotions unto

82
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:37,344
the Most High;

83
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:38,201
11

84
00:04:38,201 --> 00:04:39,058
Nevertheless thy vows

85
00:04:39,058 --> 00:04:39,915
shall be

86
00:04:39,915 --> 00:04:40,772
offered up in

87
00:04:40,772 --> 00:04:41,629
righteousness on

88
00:04:41,629 --> 00:04:42,486
all days and

89
00:04:42,486 --> 00:04:43,216
at all times;

90
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
12 But

91
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
remember that on

92
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
this, the

93
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
Lord’s day,

94
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
thou shalt

95
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
offer thine

96
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
oblations and

97
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
thy

98
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
sacraments unto the

99
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
Most High,

100
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
confessing thy

101
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
sins unto

102
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
thy brethren,

103
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
and before the Lord.

104
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
13 And on

105
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
this day

106
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
thou shalt do

107
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
none other

108
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
thing, only

109
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
let thy

110
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
food be

111
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
prepared with

112
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
singleness of

113
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
heart that

114
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
thy

115
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
fasting may be

116
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
perfect, or,

117
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
in other

118
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
words, that

119
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
thy joy may be full.

120
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
14

121
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
Verily, this is

122
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
fasting

123
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
and

124
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
prayer, or in

125
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
other

126
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
words,

127
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
rejoicing and prayer.

128
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
15 And

129
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
inasmuch

130
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
as ye do

131
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
these

132
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
things

133
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
with

134
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
thanksgiving,

135
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
with

136
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
cheerful

137
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
hearts

138
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
and

139
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
countenances,

140
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
not with

141
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
much

142
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
laughter,

143
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
for this

144
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
is sin,

145
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
but

146
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
with a glad

147
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
heart

148
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
and a cheerful countenance—

149
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
16

150
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
Verily I

151
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
say, that

152
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216


153
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
inasmuch as

154
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
ye do

155
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
this, the

156
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216


157
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
fulness of

00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
the earth

159
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
is

160
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
yours, the

beasts

162
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216

168
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
and that

169
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
which

170
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216

171
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216

17

175
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:43,216
Yea, and
