00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 59 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Prophet, in Zion, Jackson County, Missouri,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
August 7, 1831. Preceding this revelation, the land

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
was consecrated, as the Lord had directed, and the

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
site for the future temple was dedicated. On the

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
day this revelation was received, Polly Knight, the

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
wife of Joseph Knight Sr., died, the first Church

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
member to die in Zion. Early members

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
characterized this revelation as “instructing the Saints how

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
to keep the sabbath and how to fast and pray.”

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
1–4, The faithful Saints in Zion will be blessed;

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
5–8, They are to love and serve the Lord and keep

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
His commandments; 
9–19, By keeping the Lord’s day

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
holy, the Saints are blessed temporally and

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
spiritually; 
20–24, The righteous are promised peace in

16
00:00:00,0 --> 01:01:57,
this world and eternal life in the world to come. 

17
01:01:57,0 --> 01:01:57,0
1 Behold, blessed, saith the Lord, are they

18
01:01:57,0 --> 01:01:57,0
who have come up unto this land with an eye

19
01:01:57,0 --> 01:10:09,
single to my glory, according to my commandments.

20
01:10:09,0 --> 01:10:09,0
2 For those that live shall inherit

21
01:10:09,0 --> 01:10:09,0
the earth, and those that die shall

22
01:10:09,0 --> 01:10:09,0
rest from all their labors, and their

23
01:10:09,0 --> 01:10:09,0
works shall follow them; and they

24
01:10:09,0 --> 01:10:09,0
shall receive a crown in the mansions of

25
01:10:09,0 --> 01:28:47,
my Father, which I have prepared for them.

26
01:28:47,0 --> 01:28:47,0
3 Yea, blessed are they whose

27
01:28:47,0 --> 01:28:47,0
feet stand upon the land of Zion,

28
01:28:47,0 --> 01:28:47,0
who have obeyed my gospel; for they

29
01:28:47,0 --> 01:28:47,0
shall receive for their reward

30
01:28:47,0 --> 01:28:47,0
the good things of the earth, and

31
01:28:47,0 --> 01:41:55,
it shall bring forth in its strength.

32
01:41:55,0 --> 01:41:55,0
4 And they shall also be

33
01:41:55,0 --> 01:41:55,0
crowned with blessings from

34
01:41:55,0 --> 01:41:55,0
above, yea, and with commandments

35
01:41:55,0 --> 01:41:55,0
not a few, and with

36
01:41:55,0 --> 01:41:55,0
revelations in their time—they that

37
01:41:55,0 --> 01:49:03,
are faithful and diligent before me.

38
01:49:03,0 --> 01:49:03,0
5 Wherefore, I give unto

39
01:49:03,0 --> 01:49:03,0
them a commandment,

40
01:49:03,0 --> 01:49:03,0
saying thus: Thou shalt love

41
01:49:03,0 --> 01:49:03,0
the Lord thy God with all

42
01:49:03,0 --> 01:49:03,0
thy heart, with all thy

43
01:49:03,0 --> 01:49:03,0
might, mind, and strength;

44
01:49:03,0 --> 01:49:03,0
and in the name of Jesus

45
01:49:03,0 --> 01:58:13,
Christ thou shalt serve him.

46
01:58:13,0 --> 01:58:13,0
6 Thou shalt love thy

47
01:58:13,0 --> 01:58:13,0
neighbor as thyself.

48
01:58:13,0 --> 01:58:13,0
Thou shalt not

49
01:58:13,0 --> 01:58:13,0
steal; neither commit

50
01:58:13,0 --> 01:58:13,0
adultery, nor kill, nor

51
01:58:13,0 --> 02:05:21,
do anything like unto it.

52
02:05:21,0 --> 02:05:21,0
7 Thou shalt

53
02:05:21,0 --> 02:05:21,0
thank the Lord thy

54
02:05:21,0 --> 02:10:32,
God in all things.

55
02:10:32,0 --> 02:10:32,0
8 Thou shalt

56
02:10:32,0 --> 02:10:32,0
offer a sacrifice

57
02:10:32,0 --> 02:10:32,0
unto the Lord

58
02:10:32,0 --> 02:10:32,0
thy God in

59
02:10:32,0 --> 02:10:32,0
righteousness, even

60
02:10:32,0 --> 02:10:32,0
that of a

61
02:10:32,0 --> 02:10:32,0
broken heart and a

62
02:10:32,0 --> 02:19:41,
contrite spirit.

63
02:19:41,0 --> 02:19:41,0
9 And that

64
02:19:41,0 --> 02:19:41,0
thou mayest more

65
02:19:41,0 --> 02:19:41,0
fully keep

66
02:19:41,0 --> 02:19:41,0
thyself unspotted

67
02:19:41,0 --> 02:19:41,0
from the

68
02:19:41,0 --> 02:19:41,0
world, thou shalt

69
02:19:41,0 --> 02:19:41,0
go to the

70
02:19:41,0 --> 02:19:41,0
house of prayer

71
02:19:41,0 --> 02:19:41,0
and offer up thy

72
02:19:41,0 --> 02:19:41,0
sacraments

73
02:19:41,0 --> 02:23:26,
upon my holy day;

74
02:23:26,0 --> 02:23:26,0
10 For verily

75
02:23:26,0 --> 02:23:26,0
this is a

76
02:23:26,0 --> 02:23:26,0
day appointed

77
02:23:26,0 --> 02:23:26,0
unto you to

78
02:23:26,0 --> 02:23:26,0
rest from your

79
02:23:26,0 --> 02:23:26,0
labors, and

80
02:23:26,0 --> 02:23:26,0
to pay thy

81
02:23:26,0 --> 02:23:26,0
devotions unto

82
02:23:26,0 --> 02:30:56,
the Most High;

83
02:30:56,0 --> 02:30:56,0
11

84
02:30:56,0 --> 02:30:56,0
Nevertheless thy vows

85
02:30:56,0 --> 02:30:56,0
shall be

86
02:30:56,0 --> 02:30:56,0
offered up in

87
02:30:56,0 --> 02:30:56,0
righteousness on

88
02:30:56,0 --> 02:30:56,0
all days and

89
02:30:56,0 --> 02:43:07,
at all times;

90
02:43:07,0 --> 02:43:07,0
12 But

91
02:43:07,0 --> 02:43:07,0
remember that on

92
02:43:07,0 --> 02:43:07,0
this, the

93
02:43:07,0 --> 02:43:07,0
Lord’s day,

94
02:43:07,0 --> 02:43:07,0
thou shalt

95
02:43:07,0 --> 02:43:07,0
offer thine

96
02:43:07,0 --> 02:43:07,0
oblations and

97
02:43:07,0 --> 02:43:07,0
thy

98
02:43:07,0 --> 02:43:07,0
sacraments unto the

99
02:43:07,0 --> 02:43:07,0
Most High,

100
02:43:07,0 --> 02:43:07,0
confessing thy

101
02:43:07,0 --> 02:43:07,0
sins unto

102
02:43:07,0 --> 02:43:07,0
thy brethren,

103
02:43:07,0 --> 02:50:51,
and before the Lord.

104
02:50:51,0 --> 02:50:51,0
13 And on

105
02:50:51,0 --> 02:50:51,0
this day

106
02:50:51,0 --> 02:50:51,0
thou shalt do

107
02:50:51,0 --> 02:50:51,0
none other

108
02:50:51,0 --> 02:50:51,0
thing, only

109
02:50:51,0 --> 02:50:51,0
let thy

110
02:50:51,0 --> 02:50:51,0
food be

111
02:50:51,0 --> 02:50:51,0
prepared with

112
02:50:51,0 --> 02:50:51,0
singleness of

113
02:50:51,0 --> 02:50:51,0
heart that

114
02:50:51,0 --> 02:50:51,0
thy

115
02:50:51,0 --> 02:50:51,0
fasting may be

116
02:50:51,0 --> 02:50:51,0
perfect, or,

117
02:50:51,0 --> 02:50:51,0
in other

118
02:50:51,0 --> 02:50:51,0
words, that

119
02:50:51,0 --> 02:57:02,
thy joy may be full.

120
02:57:02,0 --> 02:57:02,0
14

121
02:57:02,0 --> 02:57:02,0
Verily, this is

122
02:57:02,0 --> 02:57:02,0
fasting

123
02:57:02,0 --> 02:57:02,0
and

124
02:57:02,0 --> 02:57:02,0
prayer, or in

125
02:57:02,0 --> 02:57:02,0
other

126
02:57:02,0 --> 02:57:02,0
words,

127
02:57:02,0 --> 03:09:13,
rejoicing and prayer.

128
03:09:13,0 --> 03:09:13,0
15 And

129
03:09:13,0 --> 03:09:13,0
inasmuch

130
03:09:13,0 --> 03:09:13,0
as ye do

131
03:09:13,0 --> 03:09:13,0
these

132
03:09:13,0 --> 03:09:13,0
things

133
03:09:13,0 --> 03:09:13,0
with

134
03:09:13,0 --> 03:09:13,0
thanksgiving,

135
03:09:13,0 --> 03:09:13,0
with

136
03:09:13,0 --> 03:09:13,0
cheerful

137
03:09:13,0 --> 03:09:13,0
hearts

138
03:09:13,0 --> 03:09:13,0
and

139
03:09:13,0 --> 03:09:13,0
countenances,

140
03:09:13,0 --> 03:09:13,0
not with

141
03:09:13,0 --> 03:09:13,0
much

142
03:09:13,0 --> 03:09:13,0
laughter,

143
03:09:13,0 --> 03:09:13,0
for this

144
03:09:13,0 --> 03:09:13,0
is sin,

145
03:09:13,0 --> 03:09:13,0
but

146
03:09:13,0 --> 03:09:13,0
with a glad

147
03:09:13,0 --> 03:09:13,0
heart

148
03:09:13,0 --> 03:20:06,
and a cheerful countenance—

149
03:20:06,0 --> 03:20:06,0
16

150
03:20:06,0 --> 03:20:06,0
Verily I

151
03:20:06,0 --> 03:20:06,0
say, that

152
03:20:06,0 --> 03:20:06,0


153
03:20:06,0 --> 03:20:06,0
inasmuch as

154
03:20:06,0 --> 03:20:06,0
ye do

155
03:20:06,0 --> 03:20:06,0
this, the

03:20:06,0 --> 03:20:06,0


157
03:20:06,0 --> 03:20:06,0

159
03:20:06,0 --> 03:20:06,0
is

160
03:20:06,0 --> 03:20:06,0
yours, the

162
03:20:06,0 --> 03:20:06,0

17

175
03:26:16,0 --> 03:26:16,0
Yea, and
