Section 36 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Prophet to Edward Partridge, near Fayette,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
New York, December 9, 1830 (see the 
heading to

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
section 35). Joseph Smith’s history states that

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Edward Partridge “was a pattern of piety, and one of

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Lord’s great men.” 
1–3, The Lord lays His

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
hand upon Edward Partridge by the hand of Sidney

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Rigdon; 
4–8, Every man who receives the gospel and

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:27:03,
the priesthood is to be called to go forth and preach. 

10
00:27:03,0 --> 00:27:03,0
1 Thus saith the Lord God, the Mighty One

11
00:27:03,0 --> 00:27:03,0
of Israel: Behold, I say unto you, my

12
00:27:03,0 --> 00:27:03,0
servant Edward, that you are blessed, and your

13
00:27:03,0 --> 00:27:03,0
sins are forgiven you, and you are called to

14
00:27:03,0 --> 00:40:12,
preach my gospel as with the voice of a trump;

15
00:40:12,0 --> 00:40:12,0
2 And I will lay my hand upon you by the

16
00:40:12,0 --> 00:40:12,0
hand of my servant Sidney Rigdon, and

17
00:40:12,0 --> 00:40:12,0
you shall receive my Spirit, the Holy

18
00:40:12,0 --> 00:40:12,0
Ghost, even the Comforter, which shall

19
00:40:12,0 --> 00:51:55,
teach you the peaceable things of the kingdom;

20
00:51:55,0 --> 00:51:55,0
3 And you shall declare it with a

21
00:51:55,0 --> 00:51:55,0
loud voice, saying: Hosanna,

22
00:51:55,0 --> 00:54:07,
blessed be the name of the most high God.

23
00:54:07,0 --> 00:54:07,0
4 And now this calling

24
00:54:07,0 --> 00:54:07,0
and commandment give I

25
00:54:07,0 --> 01:01:15,
unto you concerning all men—

26
01:01:15,0 --> 01:01:15,0
5 That as many as shall

27
01:01:15,0 --> 01:01:15,0
come before my

28
01:01:15,0 --> 01:01:15,0
servants Sidney Rigdon and

29
01:01:15,0 --> 01:01:15,0
Joseph Smith, Jun.,

30
01:01:15,0 --> 01:01:15,0
embracing this calling and

31
01:01:15,0 --> 01:01:15,0
commandment, shall be

32
01:01:15,0 --> 01:01:15,0
ordained and sent forth to

33
01:01:15,0 --> 01:01:15,0
preach the everlasting

34
01:01:15,0 --> 01:04:46,
gospel among the nations—

35
01:04:46,0 --> 01:04:46,0
6 Crying repentance,

36
01:04:46,0 --> 01:04:46,0
saying: Save yourselves

37
01:04:46,0 --> 01:04:46,0
from this untoward

38
01:04:46,0 --> 01:04:46,0
generation, and come

39
01:04:46,0 --> 01:04:46,0
forth out of the fire,

40
01:04:46,0 --> 01:04:46,0
hating even the garments

41
01:04:46,0 --> 01:11:27,
spotted with the flesh.

42
01:11:27,0 --> 01:11:27,0
7 And this

43
01:11:27,0 --> 01:11:27,0
commandment shall be given

44
01:11:27,0 --> 01:11:27,0
unto the elders of my

45
01:11:27,0 --> 01:11:27,0
church, that every

46
01:11:27,0 --> 01:11:27,0
man which will

47
01:11:27,0 --> 01:11:27,0
embrace it with singleness

48
01:11:27,0 --> 01:11:27,0
of heart may be

49
01:11:27,0 --> 01:11:27,0
ordained and sent

50
01:11:27,0 --> 01:15:12,
forth, even as I have spoken.

51
01:15:12,0 --> 01:15:12,0
8 I am Jesus

52
01:15:12,0 --> 01:15:12,0
Christ, the Son of

53
01:15:12,0 --> 01:15:12,0
God; wherefore,

54
01:15:12,0 --> 01:15:12,0
gird up your loins

55
01:15:12,0 --> 01:15:12,0
and I will

56
01:15:12,0 --> 01:15:12,0
suddenly come to my

57
01:15:12,0 --> 01:24:21,
temple. Even so. Amen.
