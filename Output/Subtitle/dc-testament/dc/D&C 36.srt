Section 36 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:06,0 --> 00:00:12,0
the Prophet to Edward Partridge, near Fayette,

3
00:00:12,0 --> 00:00:18,0
New York, December 9, 1830 (see the 
heading to

4
00:00:18,0 --> 00:00:24,0
section 35). Joseph Smith’s history states that

5
00:00:24,0 --> 00:00:30,0
Edward Partridge “was a pattern of piety, and one of

6
00:00:30,0 --> 00:00:36,0
the Lord’s great men.” 
1–3, The Lord lays His

7
00:00:36,0 --> 00:00:42,0
hand upon Edward Partridge by the hand of Sidney

8
00:00:42,0 --> 00:00:48,0
Rigdon; 
4–8, Every man who receives the gospel and

9
00:00:48,0 --> 00:00:54,154
the priesthood is to be called to go forth and preach. 

10
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:59,354
1 Thus saith the Lord God, the Mighty One

11
00:00:59,354 --> 00:01:04,554
of Israel: Behold, I say unto you, my

12
00:01:04,554 --> 00:01:09,754
servant Edward, that you are blessed, and your

13
00:01:09,754 --> 00:01:14,954
sins are forgiven you, and you are called to

14
00:01:14,954 --> 00:01:20,48
preach my gospel as with the voice of a trump;

15
00:01:20,48 --> 00:01:25,48
2 And I will lay my hand upon you by the

16
00:01:25,48 --> 00:01:30,48
hand of my servant Sidney Rigdon, and

17
00:01:30,48 --> 00:01:35,48
you shall receive my Spirit, the Holy

18
00:01:35,48 --> 00:01:40,48
Ghost, even the Comforter, which shall

19
00:01:40,48 --> 00:01:45,872
teach you the peaceable things of the kingdom;

20
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:53,872
3 And you shall declare it with a

21
00:01:53,872 --> 00:02:01,872
loud voice, saying: Hosanna,

22
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:09,329
blessed be the name of the most high God.

23
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:13,996
4 And now this calling

24
00:02:13,996 --> 00:02:18,663
and commandment give I

25
00:02:18,663 --> 00:02:23,643
unto you concerning all men—

26
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:24,532
5 That as many as shall

27
00:02:24,532 --> 00:02:25,421
come before my

28
00:02:25,421 --> 00:02:26,31
servants Sidney Rigdon and

29
00:02:26,31 --> 00:02:27,2
Joseph Smith, Jun.,

30
00:02:27,2 --> 00:02:28,088
embracing this calling and

31
00:02:28,088 --> 00:02:28,977
commandment, shall be

32
00:02:28,977 --> 00:02:29,867
ordained and sent forth to

33
00:02:29,867 --> 00:02:30,755
preach the everlasting

34
00:02:30,755 --> 00:02:31,151
gospel among the nations—

35
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,437
6 Crying repentance,

36
00:02:34,437 --> 00:02:37,723
saying: Save yourselves

37
00:02:37,723 --> 00:02:41,009
from this untoward

38
00:02:41,009 --> 00:02:44,295
generation, and come

39
00:02:44,295 --> 00:02:47,581
forth out of the fire,

40
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:50,867
hating even the garments

41
00:02:50,867 --> 00:02:54,608
spotted with the flesh.

42
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:54,941
7 And this

43
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:55,274
commandment shall be given

44
00:02:55,274 --> 00:02:55,607
unto the elders of my

45
00:02:55,607 --> 00:02:55,94
church, that every

46
00:02:55,94 --> 00:02:56,273
man which will

47
00:02:56,273 --> 00:02:56,606
embrace it with singleness

48
00:02:56,606 --> 00:02:56,939
of heart may be

49
00:02:56,939 --> 00:02:57,272
ordained and sent

50
00:02:57,272 --> 00:02:57,01
forth, even as I have spoken.

51
00:02:57,01 --> 00:02:56,867
8 I am Jesus

52
00:02:56,867 --> 00:02:56,724
Christ, the Son of

53
00:02:56,724 --> 00:02:56,581
God; wherefore,

54
00:02:56,581 --> 00:02:56,438
gird up your loins

55
00:02:56,438 --> 00:02:56,295
and I will

56
00:02:56,295 --> 00:02:56,152
suddenly come to my

57
00:02:56,152 --> 00:02:56,076
temple. Even so. Amen.
