00:00:19,523 --> 00:00:27,301
 the Prophet to Edward Partridge, near Fayette, New

 York, December 9, 1830 (see the 
heading to

4
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:42,857
 section 35). Joseph Smith’s history states that Edward

5
00:00:42,857 --> 00:00:50,635
 Partridge “was a pattern of piety, and one of the

6
00:00:50,635 --> 00:00:58,413
 Lord’s great men.” 
1–3, The Lord lays His hand

7
00:00:58,413 --> 00:01:06,191
 upon Edward Partridge by the hand of Sidney Rigdon;

8
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:13,969
4–8, Every man who receives the gospel and the

9
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:21,747
 priesthood is to be called to go forth and preach.

10
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:26,481
1 Thus saith the Lord God, the Mighty One of

11
00:01:26,481 --> 00:01:31,881
 Israel: Behold, I say unto you, my servant Edward, that

12
00:01:31,881 --> 00:01:37,281
 you are blessed, and your sins are forgiven you,

13
00:01:37,281 --> 00:01:42,681
 and you are called to preach my gospel as with the

14
00:01:42,681 --> 00:01:48,081
 voice of a trump

15
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:53,175
2 And I will lay my hand upon you by the hand of

16
00:01:53,175 --> 00:01:57,575
 my servant Sidney Rigdon, and you shall receive my

17
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:01,975
 Spirit, the Holy Ghost, even the Comforter, which

18
00:02:01,975 --> 00:02:06,375
 shall teach you the peaceable things of the

19
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:10,775
 kingdom

20
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:15,164
3 And you shall declare it with a loud voice,

21
00:02:15,164 --> 00:02:19,831
 saying: Hosanna, blessed be the name of the most high

22
00:02:19,831 --> 00:02:24,498
 God

23
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:27,511
4 And now this calling and commandment give I unto

24
00:02:27,511 --> 00:02:31,011
 you concerning all men

25
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:36,385
5 That as many as shall come before my servants

26
00:02:36,385 --> 00:02:41,185
 Sidney Rigdon and Joseph Smith, Jun., embracing this

27
00:02:41,185 --> 00:02:45,985
 calling and commandment, shall be ordained and

28
00:02:45,985 --> 00:02:50,785
 sent forth to preach the everlasting gospel among

29
00:02:50,785 --> 00:02:55,585
 the nations

30
00:02:55,042 --> 00:03:00,042
6 Crying repentance, saying: Save yourselves from

31
00:03:00,042 --> 00:03:05,042
 this untoward generation, and come forth out of

32
00:03:05,042 --> 00:03:10,042
 the fire, hating even the garments spotted with the

33
00:03:10,042 --> 00:03:15,042
 flesh

34
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:20,612
7 And this commandment shall be given unto the

35
00:03:20,612 --> 00:03:25,362
 elders of my church, that every man which will

36
00:03:25,362 --> 00:03:30,112
 embrace it with singleness of heart may be ordained and

37
00:03:30,112 --> 00:03:34,862
 sent forth, even as I have spoken

38
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,814
8 I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God; wherefore,

39
00:03:36,814 --> 00:03:39,481
 gird up your loins and I will suddenly come to my

40
00:03:39,481 --> 00:03:42,148
 temple. Even so. Amen.
