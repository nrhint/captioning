Section 34 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:17,611 --> 00:00:23,944
 the Prophet to Orson Pratt, at Fayette, New York,

3
00:00:23,944 --> 00:00:30,277
 November 4, 1830. Brother Pratt was nineteen years

4
00:00:30,277 --> 00:00:36,61
 old at the time. He had been converted and

5
00:00:36,61 --> 00:00:42,943
 baptized when he first heard the preaching of the

6
00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:49,276
 restored gospel by his older brother, Parley P. Pratt,

7
00:00:49,276 --> 00:00:55,609
 six weeks before. This revelation was received in

8
00:00:55,609 --> 00:01:01,942
 the Peter Whitmer Sr. home. 
1–4, The faithful

9
00:01:01,942 --> 00:01:08,275
 become the sons of God through the Atonement; 
5–9, The

10
00:01:08,275 --> 00:01:14,608
 preaching of the gospel prepares the way for the

11
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:20,941
 Second Coming; 
10–12, Prophecy comes by the power

12
00:01:20,941 --> 00:01:27,274
 of the Holy Ghost.

13
00:01:27,904 --> 00:01:33,237
1 My son Orson, hearken and hear and behold what

14
00:01:33,237 --> 00:01:38,57
 I, the Lord God, shall say unto you, even Jesus

15
00:01:38,57 --> 00:01:43,903
 Christ your Redeemer

16
00:01:43,887 --> 00:01:47,887
2 The light and the life of the world, a light

17
00:01:47,887 --> 00:01:51,887
 which shineth in darkness and the darkness

18
00:01:51,887 --> 00:01:55,887
 comprehendeth it not

19
00:01:55,882 --> 00:02:02,549
3 Who so loved the world that he gave his own

20
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:09,216
 life, that as many as would believe might become the

21
00:02:09,216 --> 00:02:15,883
 sons of God. Wherefore you are my son

22
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:20,385
4 And blessed are you because you have believed

23
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:25,407
5 And more blessed are you because you are called

24
00:02:25,407 --> 00:02:29,907
 of me to preach my gospel

25
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:34,716
6 To lift up your voice as with the sound of a

26
00:02:34,716 --> 00:02:40,216
 trump, both long and loud, and cry repentance unto a

27
00:02:40,216 --> 00:02:45,716
 crooked and perverse generation, preparing the way

28
00:02:45,716 --> 00:02:51,216
 of the Lord for his second coming

29
00:02:51,722 --> 00:02:56,055
7 For behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, the

30
00:02:56,055 --> 00:03:00,388
 time is soon at hand that I shall come in a cloud

31
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:04,721
 with power and great glory

32
00:03:04,501 --> 00:03:11,001
8 And it shall be a great day at the time of my

33
00:03:11,001 --> 00:03:17,501
 coming, for all nations shall tremble

34
00:03:17,28 --> 00:03:22,68
9 But before that great day shall come, the sun

35
00:03:22,68 --> 00:03:28,08
 shall be darkened, and the moon be turned into

36
00:03:28,08 --> 00:03:33,48
 blood; and the stars shall refuse their shining, and

37
00:03:33,48 --> 00:03:38,88
 some shall fall, and great destructions await the

38
00:03:38,88 --> 00:03:44,28
 wicked

39
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:50,291
10 Wherefore, lift up your voice and spare not,

40
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:56,041
 for the Lord God hath spoken; therefore prophesy,

41
00:03:56,041 --> 00:04:01,791
 and it shall be given by the power of the Holy

42
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:07,541
 Ghost

43
00:04:07,531 --> 00:04:11,031
11 And if you are faithful, behold, I am with you

44
00:04:11,031 --> 00:04:14,531
 until I come

45
00:04:14,538 --> 00:04:18,871
12 And verily, verily, I say unto you, I come

46
00:04:18,871 --> 00:04:23,204
 quickly. I am your Lord and your Redeemer. Even so.

47
00:04:23,204 --> 00:04:27,537
 Amen.
