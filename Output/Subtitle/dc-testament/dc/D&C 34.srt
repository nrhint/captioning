nineteen years old at the time. He had been converted

and baptized when he first heard the preaching

00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of the restored gospel by his older brother,

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Parley P. Pratt, six weeks before. This

1–4, The faithful become the sons of God

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
through the Atonement; 
5–9, The preaching of the

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
gospel prepares the way for the Second Coming;

12
00:00:00,0 --> 01:26:53,

13
01:26:53,0 --> 01:26:53,0
1 My son Orson, hearken and hear and

14
01:26:53,0 --> 01:26:53,0
behold what I, the Lord God, shall say

15
01:26:53,0 --> 01:35:56,
unto you, even Jesus Christ your Redeemer;

16
01:35:56,0 --> 01:35:56,0
2 The light and the life of the

17
01:35:56,0 --> 01:35:56,0
world, a light which shineth in darkness

18
01:35:56,0 --> 01:42:58,
and the darkness comprehendeth it not;

19
01:42:58,0 --> 01:42:58,0
3 Who so loved the world that he

20
01:42:58,0 --> 01:42:58,0
gave his own life, that as many as

21
01:42:58,0 --> 01:42:58,0
would believe might become the

22
01:42:58,0 --> 01:55:04,
sons of God. Wherefore you are my son;

23
01:55:04,0 --> 01:55:04,0
4 And blessed are you

24
01:55:04,0 --> 02:14:41,
because you have believed;

25
02:14:41,0 --> 02:14:41,0
5 And more blessed

26
02:14:41,0 --> 02:14:41,0
are you because you

27
02:14:41,0 --> 02:14:41,0
are called of me

28
02:14:41,0 --> 02:26:18,
to preach my gospel—

29
02:26:18,0 --> 02:26:18,0
6 To lift up your

30
02:26:18,0 --> 02:26:18,0
voice as with the

31
02:26:18,0 --> 02:26:18,0
sound of a trump,

32
02:26:18,0 --> 02:26:18,0
both long and

33
02:26:18,0 --> 02:26:18,0
loud, and cry

34
02:26:18,0 --> 02:26:18,0
repentance unto a crooked

35
02:26:18,0 --> 02:26:18,0
and perverse

36
02:26:18,0 --> 02:26:18,0
generation, preparing

37
02:26:18,0 --> 02:26:18,0
the way of the Lord

38
02:26:18,0 --> 02:28:22,
for his second coming.

39
02:28:22,0 --> 02:28:22,0
7 For behold,

40
02:28:22,0 --> 02:28:22,0
verily, verily,

41
02:28:22,0 --> 02:28:22,0
I say unto you,

42
02:28:22,0 --> 02:28:22,0
the time is

43
02:28:22,0 --> 02:28:22,0
soon at hand that

44
02:28:22,0 --> 02:28:22,0
I shall come

45
02:28:22,0 --> 02:28:22,0
in a cloud with

46
02:28:22,0 --> 02:50:55,
power and great glory.

47
02:50:55,0 --> 02:50:55,0
8 And it shall

48
02:50:55,0 --> 02:50:55,0
be a great

49
02:50:55,0 --> 02:50:55,0
day at the time

50
02:50:55,0 --> 02:50:55,0
of my coming,

51
02:50:55,0 --> 02:50:55,0
for all

52
02:50:55,0 --> 03:03:59,
nations shall tremble.

53
03:03:59,0 --> 03:03:59,0
9 But before

54
03:03:59,0 --> 03:03:59,0
that great

55
03:03:59,0 --> 03:03:59,0
day shall come,

56
03:03:59,0 --> 03:03:59,0
the sun

57
03:03:59,0 --> 03:03:59,0
shall be

58
03:03:59,0 --> 03:03:59,0
darkened, and the

59
03:03:59,0 --> 03:03:59,0
moon be turned

60
03:03:59,0 --> 03:03:59,0
into blood;

61
03:03:59,0 --> 03:03:59,0
and the stars

62
03:03:59,0 --> 03:03:59,0
shall refuse

63
03:03:59,0 --> 03:03:59,0
their shining,

64
03:03:59,0 --> 03:03:59,0
and some

65
03:03:59,0 --> 03:03:59,0
shall fall, and

66
03:03:59,0 --> 03:03:59,0
great

67
03:03:59,0 --> 03:16:05,
destructions await the wicked.

68
03:16:05,0 --> 03:16:05,0
10

69
03:16:05,0 --> 03:16:05,0
Wherefore, lift up

70
03:16:05,0 --> 03:16:05,0
your voice and

71
03:16:05,0 --> 03:16:05,0
spare not,

72
03:16:05,0 --> 03:16:05,0
for the Lord

73
03:16:05,0 --> 03:16:05,0
God hath

74
03:16:05,0 --> 03:16:05,0
spoken;

75
03:16:05,0 --> 03:16:05,0
therefore

76
03:16:05,0 --> 03:16:05,0
prophesy, and it

77
03:16:05,0 --> 03:16:05,0
shall be given

78
03:16:05,0 --> 03:16:05,0
by the power

79
03:16:05,0 --> 03:43:41,
of the Holy Ghost.

80
03:43:41,0 --> 03:43:41,0
11 And if

81
03:43:41,0 --> 03:43:41,0
you are

82
03:43:41,0 --> 03:43:41,0
faithful,

83
03:43:41,0 --> 03:43:41,0
behold, I am

84
03:43:41,0 --> 03:43:41,0
with you

85
03:43:41,0 --> 04:06:41,
until I come—

86
04:06:41,0 --> 04:06:41,0
12 And

87
04:06:41,0 --> 04:06:41,0
verily,

88
04:06:41,0 --> 04:06:41,0
verily, I

89
04:06:41,0 --> 04:06:41,0
say unto

90
04:06:41,0 --> 04:06:41,0
you, I come

91
04:06:41,0 --> 04:06:41,0
quickly.

92
04:06:41,0 --> 04:06:41,0
I am

93
04:06:41,0 --> 04:06:41,0
your Lord

94
04:06:41,0 --> 04:06:41,0
and your

95
04:06:41,0 --> 04:06:41,0
Redeemer.

96
04:06:41,0 --> 04:11:45,
Even so. Amen.
