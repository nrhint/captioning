Smith the Prophet to Orson Pratt, at Fayette, New

00:00:14,334 --> 00:00:21,501
York, November 4, 1830. Brother Pratt was

4
00:00:21,501 --> 00:00:28,668
nineteen years old at the time. He had been converted

5
00:00:28,668 --> 00:00:35,835
and baptized when he first heard the preaching

6
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:43,002
of the restored gospel by his older brother,

7
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:50,169
Parley P. Pratt, six weeks before. This

8
00:00:50,169 --> 00:00:57,336
revelation was received in the Peter Whitmer Sr. home.

9
00:00:57,336 --> 00:01:04,503
1–4, The faithful become the sons of God

10
00:01:04,503 --> 00:01:11,67
through the Atonement; 
5–9, The preaching of the

11
00:01:11,67 --> 00:01:18,837
gospel prepares the way for the Second Coming;

12
00:01:18,837 --> 00:01:26,97
10–12, Prophecy comes by the power of the Holy Ghost. 

13
00:01:26,97 --> 00:01:31,637
1 My son Orson, hearken and hear and

14
00:01:31,637 --> 00:01:36,304
behold what I, the Lord God, shall say

15
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:40,05
unto you, even Jesus Christ your Redeemer;

16
00:01:40,05 --> 00:01:41,05
2 The light and the life of the

17
00:01:41,05 --> 00:01:42,05
world, a light which shineth in darkness

18
00:01:42,05 --> 00:01:43,704
and the darkness comprehendeth it not;

19
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:44,954
3 Who so loved the world that he

20
00:01:44,954 --> 00:01:46,204
gave his own life, that as many as

21
00:01:46,204 --> 00:01:47,454
would believe might become the

22
00:01:47,454 --> 00:01:48,792
sons of God. Wherefore you are my son;

23
00:01:48,792 --> 00:01:51,292
4 And blessed are you

24
00:01:51,292 --> 00:01:53,88
because you have believed;

25
00:01:53,88 --> 00:01:54,13
5 And more blessed

26
00:01:54,13 --> 00:01:54,38
are you because you

27
00:01:54,38 --> 00:01:54,63
are called of me

28
00:01:54,63 --> 00:01:54,948
to preach my gospel—

29
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,048
6 To lift up your

30
00:01:57,048 --> 00:01:59,148
voice as with the

31
00:01:59,148 --> 00:02:01,248
sound of a trump,

32
00:02:01,248 --> 00:02:03,348
both long and

33
00:02:03,348 --> 00:02:05,448
loud, and cry

34
00:02:05,448 --> 00:02:07,548
repentance unto a crooked

35
00:02:07,548 --> 00:02:09,648
and perverse

36
00:02:09,648 --> 00:02:11,748
generation, preparing

37
00:02:11,748 --> 00:02:13,848
the way of the Lord

38
00:02:13,848 --> 00:02:15,052
for his second coming.

39
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:15,927
7 For behold,

40
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:16,802
verily, verily,

41
00:02:16,802 --> 00:02:17,677
I say unto you,

42
00:02:17,677 --> 00:02:18,552
the time is

43
00:02:18,552 --> 00:02:19,427
soon at hand that

44
00:02:19,427 --> 00:02:20,302
I shall come

45
00:02:20,302 --> 00:02:21,177
in a cloud with

46
00:02:21,177 --> 00:02:22,109
power and great glory.

47
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:23,109
8 And it shall

48
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:24,109
be a great

49
00:02:24,109 --> 00:02:25,109
day at the time

50
00:02:25,109 --> 00:02:26,109
of my coming,

51
00:02:26,109 --> 00:02:27,109
for all

52
00:02:27,109 --> 00:02:28,198
nations shall tremble.

53
00:02:28,198 --> 00:02:28,931
9 But before

54
00:02:28,931 --> 00:02:29,664
that great

55
00:02:29,664 --> 00:02:30,397
day shall come,

56
00:02:30,397 --> 00:02:31,13
the sun

57
00:02:31,13 --> 00:02:31,863
shall be

58
00:02:31,863 --> 00:02:32,596
darkened, and the

59
00:02:32,596 --> 00:02:33,329
moon be turned

60
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:34,062
into blood;

61
00:02:34,062 --> 00:02:34,795
and the stars

62
00:02:34,795 --> 00:02:35,528
shall refuse

63
00:02:35,528 --> 00:02:36,261
their shining,

64
00:02:36,261 --> 00:02:36,994
and some

65
00:02:36,994 --> 00:02:37,727
shall fall, and

66
00:02:37,727 --> 00:02:38,46
great

67
00:02:38,46 --> 00:02:39,226
destructions await the wicked.

68
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:40,143
10

69
00:02:40,143 --> 00:02:41,06
Wherefore, lift up

70
00:02:41,06 --> 00:02:41,977
your voice and

71
00:02:41,977 --> 00:02:42,894
spare not,

72
00:02:42,894 --> 00:02:43,811
for the Lord

73
00:02:43,811 --> 00:02:44,728
God hath

74
00:02:44,728 --> 00:02:45,645
spoken;

75
00:02:45,645 --> 00:02:46,562
therefore

76
00:02:46,562 --> 00:02:47,479
prophesy, and it

77
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,396
shall be given

78
00:02:48,396 --> 00:02:49,313
by the power

79
00:02:49,313 --> 00:02:50,871
of the Holy Ghost.

80
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:52,871
11 And if

81
00:02:52,871 --> 00:02:54,871
you are

82
00:02:54,871 --> 00:02:56,871
faithful,

83
00:02:56,871 --> 00:02:58,871
behold, I am

84
00:02:58,871 --> 00:03:00,871
with you

85
00:03:00,871 --> 00:03:02,983
until I come—

86
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:04,256
12 And

87
00:03:04,256 --> 00:03:05,529
verily,

88
00:03:05,529 --> 00:03:06,802
verily, I

89
00:03:06,802 --> 00:03:08,075
say unto

90
00:03:08,075 --> 00:03:09,348
you, I come

91
00:03:09,348 --> 00:03:10,621
quickly.

92
00:03:10,621 --> 00:03:11,894
I am

93
00:03:11,894 --> 00:03:13,167
your Lord

94
00:03:13,167 --> 00:03:14,44
and your

95
00:03:14,44 --> 00:03:15,713
Redeemer.

96
00:03:15,713 --> 00:03:16,063
Even so. Amen.
