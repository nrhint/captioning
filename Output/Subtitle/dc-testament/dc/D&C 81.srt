00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 81 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Prophet, at Hiram, Ohio, March 15, 1832.

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Frederick G. Williams is called to be a high

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
priest and a counselor in the Presidency of the High

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Priesthood. The historical records show that

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
when this revelation was received in March 1832, it

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
called Jesse Gause to the office of counselor

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
to Joseph Smith in the Presidency. However, when

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
he failed to continue in a manner consistent

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
with this appointment, the call was subsequently

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
transferred to Frederick G. Williams. The

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
revelation (dated March 1832) should be regarded as a

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
step toward the formal organization of the First

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Presidency, specifically calling for the office

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of counselor in that body and explaining the

16
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
dignity of the appointment. Brother Gause served for

17
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
a time but was excommunicated from the Church

18
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
in December 1832. Brother Williams was ordained

19
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
to the specified office on March 18, 1833. 
1–2,

20
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
The keys of the kingdom are always held by the

21
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
First Presidency; 
3–7, If Frederick G. Williams

22
00:00:00,0 --> 02:27:49,
is faithful in his ministry, he will have eternal life. 

23
02:27:49,0 --> 02:27:49,0
1 Verily, verily, I say unto you my servant

24
02:27:49,0 --> 02:27:49,0
Frederick G. Williams: Listen to the voice of him

25
02:27:49,0 --> 02:27:49,0
who speaketh, to the word of the Lord your God,

26
02:27:49,0 --> 02:27:49,0
and hearken to the calling wherewith you are

27
02:27:49,0 --> 02:27:49,0
called, even to be a high priest in my church,

28
02:27:49,0 --> 02:38:50,
and a counselor unto my servant Joseph Smith, Jun.;

29
02:38:50,0 --> 02:38:50,0
2 Unto whom I have given the keys of

30
02:38:50,0 --> 02:38:50,0
the kingdom, which belong always unto

31
02:38:50,0 --> 02:49:50,
the Presidency of the High Priesthood:

32
02:49:50,0 --> 02:49:50,0
3 Therefore, verily I acknowledge

33
02:49:50,0 --> 02:49:50,0
him and will bless him, and also thee,

34
02:49:50,0 --> 02:49:50,0
inasmuch as thou art faithful in

35
02:49:50,0 --> 02:49:50,0
counsel, in the office which I have

36
02:49:50,0 --> 02:49:50,0
appointed unto you, in prayer always,

37
02:49:50,0 --> 02:49:50,0
vocally and in thy heart, in public

38
02:49:50,0 --> 02:49:50,0
and in private, also in thy ministry

39
02:49:50,0 --> 02:49:50,0
in proclaiming the gospel in the

40
02:49:50,0 --> 02:54:55,
land of the living, and among thy brethren.

41
02:54:55,0 --> 02:54:55,0
4 And in doing these things thou

42
02:54:55,0 --> 02:54:55,0
wilt do the greatest good unto

43
02:54:55,0 --> 02:54:55,0
thy fellow beings, and wilt promote

44
02:54:55,0 --> 02:54:33,
the glory of him who is your Lord.

45
02:54:33,0 --> 02:54:33,0
5 Wherefore, be faithful; stand

46
02:54:33,0 --> 02:54:33,0
in the office which I have

47
02:54:33,0 --> 02:54:33,0
appointed unto you; succor the weak,

48
02:54:33,0 --> 02:54:33,0
lift up the hands which hang

49
02:54:33,0 --> 02:52:39,
down, and strengthen the feeble knees.

50
02:52:39,0 --> 02:52:39,0
6 And if thou art faithful

51
02:52:39,0 --> 02:52:39,0
unto the end thou shalt

52
02:52:39,0 --> 02:52:39,0
have a crown of

53
02:52:39,0 --> 02:52:39,0
immortality, and eternal life in the

54
02:52:39,0 --> 02:52:39,0
mansions which I have

55
02:52:39,0 --> 02:58:44,
prepared in the house of my Father.

56
02:58:44,0 --> 02:58:44,0
7 Behold, and lo,

57
02:58:44,0 --> 02:58:44,0
these are the words of

58
02:58:44,0 --> 02:58:44,0
Alpha and Omega,

59
02:58:44,0 --> 03:03:49,
even Jesus Christ. Amen.
