1
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:17,989
Section 81 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:17,989 --> 00:00:24,216
 the Prophet, at Hiram, Ohio, March 15, 1832.

3
00:00:24,216 --> 00:00:30,443
 Frederick G. Williams is called to be a high priest and

4
00:00:30,443 --> 00:00:36,67
 a counselor in the Presidency of the High

5
00:00:36,67 --> 00:00:42,897
 Priesthood. The historical records show that when this

6
00:00:42,897 --> 00:00:49,124
 revelation was received in March 1832, it called

7
00:00:49,124 --> 00:00:55,351
 Jesse Gause to the office of counselor to Joseph Smith

8
00:00:55,351 --> 00:01:01,578
 in the Presidency. However, when he failed to

9
00:01:01,578 --> 00:01:07,805
 continue in a manner consistent with this

10
00:01:07,805 --> 00:01:14,032
 appointment, the call was subsequently transferred to

11
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:20,259
 Frederick G. Williams. The revelation (dated March 1832)

12
00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:26,486
 should be regarded as a step toward the formal

13
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:32,713
 organization of the First Presidency, specifically

14
00:01:32,713 --> 00:01:38,94
 calling for the office of counselor in that body and

15
00:01:38,94 --> 00:01:45,167
 explaining the dignity of the appointment.

16
00:01:45,167 --> 00:01:51,394
 Brother Gause served for a time but was excommunicated

17
00:01:51,394 --> 00:01:57,621
 from the Church in December 1832. Brother Williams

18
00:01:57,621 --> 00:02:03,848
 was ordained to the specified office on March 18,

19
00:02:03,848 --> 00:02:10,075
 1833. 
1–2, The keys of the kingdom are always

20
00:02:10,075 --> 00:02:16,302
 held by the First Presidency; 
3–7, If Frederick G.

21
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:22,529
 Williams is faithful in his ministry, he will have

22
00:02:22,529 --> 00:02:28,756
 eternal life.

23
00:02:28,865 --> 00:02:34,198
1 Verily, verily, I say unto you my servant

24
00:02:34,198 --> 00:02:39,531
 Frederick G. Williams: Listen to the voice of him who

25
00:02:39,531 --> 00:02:44,864
 speaketh, to the word of the Lord your God, and

26
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:50,197
 hearken to the calling wherewith you are called, even

27
00:02:50,197 --> 00:02:55,53
 to be a high priest in my church, and a counselor

28
00:02:55,53 --> 00:03:00,863
 unto my servant Joseph Smith, Jun.

29
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:03,78
2 Unto whom I have given the keys of the kingdom,

30
00:03:03,78 --> 00:03:07,447
 which belong always unto the Presidency of the

31
00:03:07,447 --> 00:03:11,114
 High Priesthood

32
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:17,41
3 Therefore, verily I acknowledge him and will

33
00:03:17,41 --> 00:03:23,696
 bless him, and also thee, inasmuch as thou art

34
00:03:23,696 --> 00:03:29,982
 faithful in counsel, in the office which I have

35
00:03:29,982 --> 00:03:36,268
 appointed unto you, in prayer always, vocally and in thy

36
00:03:36,268 --> 00:03:42,554
 heart, in public and in private, also in thy

37
00:03:42,554 --> 00:03:48,84
 ministry in proclaiming the gospel in the land of the

38
00:03:48,84 --> 00:03:55,126
 living, and among thy brethren

39
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:59,402
4 And in doing these things thou wilt do the

40
00:03:59,402 --> 00:04:03,402
 greatest good unto thy fellow beings, and wilt promote

41
00:04:03,402 --> 00:04:07,402
 the glory of him who is your Lord

42
00:04:07,397 --> 00:04:13,897
5 Wherefore, be faithful; stand in the office

43
00:04:13,897 --> 00:04:20,397
 which I have appointed unto you; succor the weak, lift

44
00:04:20,397 --> 00:04:26,897
 up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the

45
00:04:26,897 --> 00:04:33,397
 feeble knees

46
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:39,207
6 And if thou art faithful unto the end thou shalt

47
00:04:39,207 --> 00:04:44,707
 have a crown of immortality, and eternal life in

48
00:04:44,707 --> 00:04:50,207
 the mansions which I have prepared in the house of

49
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:55,707
 my Father

50
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:59,695
7 Behold, and lo, these are the words of Alpha and

51
00:04:59,695 --> 00:05:03,695
 Omega, even Jesus Christ. Amen.
