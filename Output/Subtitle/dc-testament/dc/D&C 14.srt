00:00:15,143 --> 00:00:30,286
an inquiry through the Urim and Thummim.

00:00:30,286 --> 00:00:45,429
David Whitmer later became one of the Three

00:00:45,429 --> 00:01:00,572
Witnesses to the Book of Mormon. 
1–6, Laborers in

5
00:01:00,572 --> 00:01:15,715
the vineyard will gain salvation; 
7–8,

6
00:01:15,715 --> 00:01:30,858
Eternal life is the greatest of God’s gifts;

7
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:46,073
9–11, Christ created the heavens and the earth. 

8
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:56,573
1 A great and marvelous work is about

9
00:01:56,573 --> 00:02:07,427
to come forth unto the children of men.

10
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:09,427
2 Behold, I am God; give heed to my

11
00:02:09,427 --> 00:02:11,427
word, which is quick and powerful,

12
00:02:11,427 --> 00:02:13,427
sharper than a two-edged sword, to the

13
00:02:13,427 --> 00:02:15,427
dividing asunder of both joints and

14
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:17,804
marrow; therefore give heed unto my word.

15
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:22,233
3 Behold, the field is white

16
00:02:22,233 --> 00:02:26,662
already to harvest; therefore, whoso

17
00:02:26,662 --> 00:02:31,091
desireth to reap let him thrust in

18
00:02:31,091 --> 00:02:35,52
his sickle with his might, and reap

19
00:02:35,52 --> 00:02:39,949
while the day lasts, that he may

20
00:02:39,949 --> 00:02:44,378
treasure up for his soul

21
00:02:44,378 --> 00:02:48,769
everlasting salvation in the kingdom of God.

22
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:59,769
4 Yea, whosoever will

23
00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:10,769
thrust in his sickle and reap,

24
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:21,134
the same is called of God.

25
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:23,634
5 Therefore, if you will

26
00:03:23,634 --> 00:03:26,134
ask of me you shall

27
00:03:26,134 --> 00:03:28,634
receive; if you will knock it

28
00:03:28,634 --> 00:03:31,511
shall be opened unto you.

29
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,011
6 Seek to bring

30
00:03:34,011 --> 00:03:36,511
forth and establish my

31
00:03:36,511 --> 00:03:39,011
Zion. Keep my

32
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:41,888
commandments in all things.

33
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,031
7 And, if you keep

34
00:03:44,031 --> 00:03:46,174
my commandments and

35
00:03:46,174 --> 00:03:48,317
endure to the end

36
00:03:48,317 --> 00:03:50,46
you shall have

37
00:03:50,46 --> 00:03:52,603
eternal life, which

38
00:03:52,603 --> 00:03:54,746
gift is the greatest

39
00:03:54,746 --> 00:03:56,903
of all the gifts of God.

40
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:57,965
8 And it shall

41
00:03:57,965 --> 00:03:59,027
come to pass, that if

42
00:03:59,027 --> 00:04:00,089
you shall ask the

43
00:04:00,089 --> 00:04:01,151
Father in my

44
00:04:01,151 --> 00:04:02,213
name, in faith

45
00:04:02,213 --> 00:04:03,275
believing, you shall

46
00:04:03,275 --> 00:04:04,337
receive the Holy

47
00:04:04,337 --> 00:04:05,399
Ghost, which giveth

48
00:04:05,399 --> 00:04:06,461
utterance, that you

49
00:04:06,461 --> 00:04:07,523
may stand as a

50
00:04:07,523 --> 00:04:08,585
witness of the things

51
00:04:08,585 --> 00:04:09,647
of which you shall

52
00:04:09,647 --> 00:04:10,709
both hear and

53
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:11,771
see, and also that

54
00:04:11,771 --> 00:04:12,833
you may declare

55
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:13,32
repentance unto this generation.

56
00:04:13,32 --> 00:04:16,07
9 Behold, I am

57
00:04:16,07 --> 00:04:18,82
Jesus Christ, the

58
00:04:18,82 --> 00:04:21,57
Son of the

59
00:04:21,57 --> 00:04:24,32
living God, who

60
00:04:24,32 --> 00:04:27,07
created the heavens

61
00:04:27,07 --> 00:04:29,82
and the earth, a

62
00:04:29,82 --> 00:04:32,57
light which

63
00:04:32,57 --> 00:04:35,575
cannot be hid in darkness;

64
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:37,289
10 Wherefore,

65
00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:39,003
I must bring

66
00:04:39,003 --> 00:04:40,717
forth the

67
00:04:40,717 --> 00:04:42,431
fulness of my

68
00:04:42,431 --> 00:04:44,145
gospel from the

69
00:04:44,145 --> 00:04:45,859

70
00:04:45,859 --> 00:04:47,954
house of Israel.

71
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,597
11 And

72
00:04:49,597 --> 00:04:51,24
behold, thou art

73
00:04:51,24 --> 00:04:52,883
David, and thou

74
00:04:52,883 --> 00:04:54,526
art called

75
00:04:54,526 --> 00:04:56,169
to assist;

76
00:04:56,169 --> 00:04:57,812
which thing if

77
00:04:57,812 --> 00:04:59,455
ye do, and are

78
00:04:59,455 --> 00:05:01,098
faithful, ye

79
00:05:01,098 --> 00:05:02,741
shall be

80
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:04,384
blessed both

81
00:05:04,384 --> 00:05:06,027

82
00:05:06,027 --> 00:05:07,67
temporally,

83
00:05:07,67 --> 00:05:09,313
and great

84
00:05:09,313 --> 00:05:10,21
shall be your reward. Amen.
