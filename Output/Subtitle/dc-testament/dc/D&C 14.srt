sections 15 and 
16) were given in answer to an

2
00:00:27,992 --> 00:00:44,706
 inquiry through the Urim and Thummim. David Whitmer

3
00:00:44,706 --> 00:01:01,42
 later became one of the Three Witnesses to the

00:01:01,42 --> 00:01:18,134
 Book of Mormon. 
1–6, Laborers in the vineyard will

5
00:01:18,134 --> 00:01:34,848
 gain salvation; 
7–8, Eternal life is the greatest

6
00:01:34,848 --> 00:01:51,562
 of God’s gifts; 
9–11, Christ created the heavens

7
00:01:51,562 --> 00:02:08,276
 and the earth.

8
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:14,195
1 A great and marvelous work is about to come

9
00:02:14,195 --> 00:02:20,195
 forth unto the children of men

10
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:27,423
2 Behold, I am God; give heed to my word, which is

11
00:02:27,423 --> 00:02:34,673
 quick and powerful, sharper than a two-edged

12
00:02:34,673 --> 00:02:41,923
 sword, to the dividing asunder of both joints and

13
00:02:41,923 --> 00:02:49,173
 marrow; therefore give heed unto my word

14
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:55,536
3 Behold, the field is white already to harvest;

15
00:02:55,536 --> 00:03:01,936
 therefore, whoso desireth to reap let him thrust in

16
00:03:01,936 --> 00:03:08,336
 his sickle with his might, and reap while the day

17
00:03:08,336 --> 00:03:14,736
 lasts, that he may treasure up for his soul

18
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:21,136
 everlasting salvation in the kingdom of God

19
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:27,368
4 Yea, whosoever will thrust in his sickle and

20
00:03:27,368 --> 00:03:32,868
 reap, the same is called of God

21
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:36,079
5 Therefore, if you will ask of me you shall

22
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:39,746
 receive; if you will knock it shall be opened unto you

23
00:03:39,746 --> 00:03:43,413


24
00:03:43,69 --> 00:03:50,19
6 Seek to bring forth and establish my Zion. Keep

25
00:03:50,19 --> 00:03:56,69
 my commandments in all things

26
00:03:56,97 --> 00:04:02,97
7 And, if you keep my commandments and endure to

27
00:04:02,97 --> 00:04:08,97
 the end you shall have eternal life, which gift is

28
00:04:08,97 --> 00:04:14,97
 the greatest of all the gifts of God

29
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:19,921
8 And it shall come to pass, that if you shall ask

30
00:04:19,921 --> 00:04:25,588
 the Father in my name, in faith believing, you

31
00:04:25,588 --> 00:04:31,255
 shall receive the Holy Ghost, which giveth

32
00:04:31,255 --> 00:04:36,922
 utterance, that you may stand as a witness of the things of

33
00:04:36,922 --> 00:04:42,589
 which you shall both hear and see, and also that

34
00:04:42,589 --> 00:04:48,256
 you may declare repentance unto this generation

35
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:56,288
9 Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of the living

36
00:04:56,288 --> 00:05:03,621
 God, who created the heavens and the earth, a

37
00:05:03,621 --> 00:05:10,954
 light which cannot be hid in darkness

38
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:15,01
10 Wherefore, I must bring forth the fulness of my

39
00:05:15,01 --> 00:05:19,343
 gospel from the Gentiles unto the house of

40
00:05:19,343 --> 00:05:23,676
 Israel
