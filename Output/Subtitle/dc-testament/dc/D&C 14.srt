00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0

David Whitmer later became one of the Three

1–6, Laborers in

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the vineyard will gain salvation; 
7–8,

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Eternal life is the greatest of God’s gifts;

7
00:00:00,0 --> 01:03:44,
9–11, Christ created the heavens and the earth. 

8
01:03:44,0 --> 01:03:44,0
1 A great and marvelous work is about

9
01:03:44,0 --> 01:06:54,
to come forth unto the children of men.

10
01:06:54,0 --> 01:06:54,0
2 Behold, I am God; give heed to my

11
01:06:54,0 --> 01:06:54,0
word, which is quick and powerful,

12
01:06:54,0 --> 01:06:54,0
sharper than a two-edged sword, to the

13
01:06:54,0 --> 01:06:54,0
dividing asunder of both joints and

14
01:06:54,0 --> 01:06:40,
marrow; therefore give heed unto my word.

15
01:06:40,0 --> 01:06:40,0
3 Behold, the field is white

16
01:06:40,0 --> 01:06:40,0
already to harvest; therefore, whoso

17
01:06:40,0 --> 01:06:40,0
desireth to reap let him thrust in

18
01:06:40,0 --> 01:06:40,0
his sickle with his might, and reap

19
01:06:40,0 --> 01:06:40,0
while the day lasts, that he may

20
01:06:40,0 --> 01:06:40,0
treasure up for his soul

21
01:06:40,0 --> 01:06:54,
everlasting salvation in the kingdom of God.

22
01:06:54,0 --> 01:06:54,0
4 Yea, whosoever will

23
01:06:54,0 --> 01:06:54,0
thrust in his sickle and reap,

24
01:06:54,0 --> 01:06:40,
the same is called of God.

25
01:06:40,0 --> 01:06:40,0
5 Therefore, if you will

26
01:06:40,0 --> 01:06:40,0
ask of me you shall

27
01:06:40,0 --> 01:06:40,0
receive; if you will knock it

28
01:06:40,0 --> 01:06:54,
shall be opened unto you.

29
01:06:54,0 --> 01:06:54,0
6 Seek to bring

30
01:06:54,0 --> 01:06:54,0
forth and establish my

31
01:06:54,0 --> 01:06:54,0
Zion. Keep my

32
01:06:54,0 --> 01:06:40,
commandments in all things.

33
01:06:40,0 --> 01:06:40,0
7 And, if you keep

34
01:06:40,0 --> 01:06:40,0
my commandments and

35
01:06:40,0 --> 01:06:40,0
endure to the end

36
01:06:40,0 --> 01:06:40,0
you shall have

37
01:06:40,0 --> 01:06:40,0
eternal life, which

38
01:06:40,0 --> 01:06:40,0
gift is the greatest

39
01:06:40,0 --> 01:06:54,
of all the gifts of God.

40
01:06:54,0 --> 01:06:54,0
8 And it shall

41
01:06:54,0 --> 01:06:54,0
come to pass, that if

42
01:06:54,0 --> 01:06:54,0
you shall ask the

43
01:06:54,0 --> 01:06:54,0
Father in my

44
01:06:54,0 --> 01:06:54,0
name, in faith

45
01:06:54,0 --> 01:06:54,0
believing, you shall

46
01:06:54,0 --> 01:06:54,0
receive the Holy

47
01:06:54,0 --> 01:06:54,0
Ghost, which giveth

48
01:06:54,0 --> 01:06:54,0
utterance, that you

49
01:06:54,0 --> 01:06:54,0
may stand as a

50
01:06:54,0 --> 01:06:54,0
witness of the things

51
01:06:54,0 --> 01:06:54,0
of which you shall

52
01:06:54,0 --> 01:06:54,0
both hear and

53
01:06:54,0 --> 01:06:54,0
see, and also that

54
01:06:54,0 --> 01:06:54,0
you may declare

55
01:06:54,0 --> 01:06:40,
repentance unto this generation.

56
01:06:40,0 --> 01:06:40,0
9 Behold, I am

57
01:06:40,0 --> 01:06:40,0
Jesus Christ, the

58
01:06:40,0 --> 01:06:40,0
Son of the

59
01:06:40,0 --> 01:06:40,0
living God, who

60
01:06:40,0 --> 01:06:40,0
created the heavens

61
01:06:40,0 --> 01:06:40,0
and the earth, a

62
01:06:40,0 --> 01:06:40,0
light which

63
01:06:40,0 --> 01:06:54,
cannot be hid in darkness;

64
01:06:54,0 --> 01:06:54,0
10 Wherefore,

65
01:06:54,0 --> 01:06:54,0
I must bring

66
01:06:54,0 --> 01:06:54,0
forth the

67
01:06:54,0 --> 01:06:54,0
fulness of my

68
01:06:54,0 --> 01:06:54,0
gospel from the

69
01:06:54,0 --> 01:06:54,0
Gentiles unto the

70
01:06:54,0 --> 01:06:40,
house of Israel.

71
01:06:40,0 --> 01:06:40,0

72
01:06:40,0 --> 01:06:40,0
behold, thou art

73
01:06:40,0 --> 01:06:40,0
David, and thou

74
01:06:40,0 --> 01:06:40,0
art called

75
01:06:40,0 --> 01:06:40,0
to assist;

76
01:06:40,0 --> 01:06:40,0
which thing if

77
01:06:40,0 --> 01:06:40,0
ye do, and are

78
01:06:40,0 --> 01:06:40,0
faithful, ye

79
01:06:40,0 --> 01:06:40,0
shall be

80
01:06:40,0 --> 01:06:40,0
blessed both

81
01:06:40,0 --> 01:06:40,0
spiritually and

82
01:06:40,0 --> 01:06:40,0
temporally,

83
01:06:40,0 --> 01:06:40,0
and great

84
01:06:40,0 --> 01:06:54,
shall be your reward. Amen.
