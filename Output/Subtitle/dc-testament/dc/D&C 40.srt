00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:18,722
Section 40 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:18,722 --> 00:00:26,166
 Prophet and Sidney Rigdon, at Fayette, New York,

3
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:33,61
 January 6, 1831. Preceding the record of this

4
00:00:33,61 --> 00:00:41,054
 revelation, the Prophet’s history states, “As James

5
00:00:41,054 --> 00:00:48,498
 [Covel] rejected the word of the Lord, and returned to

6
00:00:48,498 --> 00:00:55,942
 his former principles and people, the Lord gave

7
00:00:55,942 --> 00:01:03,386
 unto me and Sidney Rigdon the following revelation”

8
00:01:03,386 --> 00:01:10,83
 (see 
section 39). 
1–3, Fear of persecution and

9
00:01:10,83 --> 00:01:18,274
 cares of the world cause rejection of the gospel.

10
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:24,212
1 Behold, verily I say unto you, that the heart of

11
00:01:24,212 --> 00:01:29,879
 my servant James Covel was right before me, for

12
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:35,546
 he covenanted with me that he would obey my word

13
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:40,329
2 And he received the word with gladness, but

14
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:44,829
 straightway Satan tempted him; and the fear of

15
00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:49,329
 persecution and the cares of the world caused him to

16
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:53,829
 reject the word

17
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:56,014
3 Wherefore he broke my covenant, and it remaineth

18
00:01:56,014 --> 00:01:58,681
 with me to do with him as seemeth me good. Amen.

00:01:58,681 --> 00:02:01,348
