00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 40 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Prophet and Sidney Rigdon, at Fayette, New York,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
January 6, 1831. Preceding the record of this

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
revelation, the Prophet’s history states, “As James

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
[Covel] rejected the word of the Lord, and

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
returned to his former principles and people, the Lord

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
gave unto me and Sidney Rigdon the following

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
revelation” (see 
section 39). 
1–3, Fear of

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:39:01,
persecution and cares of the world cause rejection of the gospel. 

10
00:39:01,0 --> 00:39:01,0
1 Behold, verily I say unto you, that

11
00:39:01,0 --> 00:39:01,0
the heart of my servant James Covel

12
00:39:01,0 --> 00:39:01,0
was right before me, for he

13
00:39:01,0 --> 00:45:42,
covenanted with me that he would obey my word.

14
00:45:42,0 --> 00:45:42,0
2 And he received the word with

15
00:45:42,0 --> 00:45:42,0
gladness, but straightway Satan

16
00:45:42,0 --> 00:45:42,0
tempted him; and the fear of

17
00:45:42,0 --> 00:45:42,0
persecution and the cares of the

18
00:45:42,0 --> 00:46:54,
world caused him to reject the word.

19
00:46:54,0 --> 00:46:54,0
3 Wherefore he broke my

20
00:46:54,0 --> 00:46:54,0
covenant, and it remaineth

21
00:46:54,0 --> 00:46:54,0
with me to do with him

22
00:46:54,0 --> 00:54:02,
as seemeth me good. Amen.
