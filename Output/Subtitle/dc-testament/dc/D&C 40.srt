00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:08,667
Section 40 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:08,667 --> 00:00:17,334
Prophet and Sidney Rigdon, at Fayette, New York,

3
00:00:17,334 --> 00:00:26,001
January 6, 1831. Preceding the record of this

4
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:34,668
revelation, the Prophet’s history states, “As James

5
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:43,335
[Covel] rejected the word of the Lord, and

6
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:52,002
returned to his former principles and people, the Lord

7
00:00:52,002 --> 00:01:00,669
gave unto me and Sidney Rigdon the following

8
00:01:00,669 --> 00:01:09,336
revelation” (see 
section 39). 
1–3, Fear of

9
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:18,111
persecution and cares of the world cause rejection of the gospel. 

10
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:21,361
1 Behold, verily I say unto you, that

11
00:01:21,361 --> 00:01:24,611
the heart of my servant James Covel

12
00:01:24,611 --> 00:01:27,861
was right before me, for he

13
00:01:27,861 --> 00:01:31,491
covenanted with me that he would obey my word.

14
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:31,491
2 And he received the word with

15
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:31,491
gladness, but straightway Satan

16
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:31,491
tempted him; and the fear of

17
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:31,491
persecution and the cares of the

18
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:31,959
world caused him to reject the word.

19
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:31,959
3 Wherefore he broke my

20
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:31,959
covenant, and it remaineth

21
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:31,959
with me to do with him

22
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:31,491
as seemeth me good. Amen.
