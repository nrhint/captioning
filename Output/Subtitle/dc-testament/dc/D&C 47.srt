00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:18,432
Section 47 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:25,586
 the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, March 8, 1831. John

3
00:00:25,586 --> 00:00:32,74
 Whitmer, who had already served as a clerk to the

4
00:00:32,74 --> 00:00:39,894
 Prophet, initially hesitated when he was asked to

5
00:00:39,894 --> 00:00:47,048
 serve as the Church historian and recorder,

6
00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:54,202
 replacing Oliver Cowdery. He wrote, “I would rather not

7
00:00:54,202 --> 00:01:01,356
 do it but observed that the will of the Lord be

8
00:01:01,356 --> 00:01:08,51
 done, and if he desires it, I desire that he would

9
00:01:08,51 --> 00:01:15,664
 manifest it through Joseph the Seer.” After Joseph

10
00:01:15,664 --> 00:01:22,818
 Smith received this revelation, John Whitmer

11
00:01:22,818 --> 00:01:29,972
 accepted and served in his appointed office. 
1–4,

12
00:01:29,972 --> 00:01:37,126
 John Whitmer is designated to keep the history of the

13
00:01:37,126 --> 00:01:44,28
 Church and to write for the Prophet.

14
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:50,372
1 Behold, it is expedient in me that my servant

15
00:01:50,372 --> 00:01:55,772
 John should write and keep a regular history, and

16
00:01:55,772 --> 00:02:01,172
 assist you, my servant Joseph, in transcribing all

17
00:02:01,172 --> 00:02:06,572
 things which shall be given you, until he is called

18
00:02:06,572 --> 00:02:11,972
 to further duties

19
00:02:11,982 --> 00:02:14,982
2 Again, verily I say unto you that he can also

20
00:02:14,982 --> 00:02:17,982
 lift up his voice in meetings, whenever it shall be

21
00:02:17,982 --> 00:02:20,982
 expedient

22
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:25,307
3 And again, I say unto you that it shall be

23
00:02:25,307 --> 00:02:30,307
 appointed unto him to keep the church record and

24
00:02:30,307 --> 00:02:35,307
 history continually; for Oliver Cowdery I have appointed

25
00:02:35,307 --> 00:02:40,307
 to another office

26
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:44,927
4 Wherefore, it shall be given him, inasmuch as he

27
00:02:44,927 --> 00:02:49,26
 is faithful, by the Comforter, to write these

28
00:02:49,26 --> 00:02:53,593
 things. Even so. Amen.
