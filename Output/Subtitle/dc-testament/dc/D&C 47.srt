00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 47 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, March 8, 1831.

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
John Whitmer, who had already served as a clerk to

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Prophet, initially hesitated when he was

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
asked to serve as the Church historian and recorder,

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
replacing Oliver Cowdery. He wrote, “I would

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
rather not do it but observed that the will of the

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Lord be done, and if he desires it, I desire that

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
he would manifest it through Joseph the Seer.”

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
After Joseph Smith received this revelation, John

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Whitmer accepted and served in his appointed

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
office. 
1–4, John Whitmer is designated to keep the

13
00:00:00,0 --> 01:42:51,
history of the Church and to write for the Prophet. 

14
01:42:51,0 --> 01:42:51,0
1 Behold, it is expedient in me that my

15
01:42:51,0 --> 01:42:51,0
servant John should write and keep a regular

16
01:42:51,0 --> 01:42:51,0
history, and assist you, my servant Joseph,

17
01:42:51,0 --> 01:42:51,0
in transcribing all things which shall be

18
01:42:51,0 --> 01:43:55,
given you, until he is called to further duties.

19
01:43:55,0 --> 01:43:55,0
2 Again, verily I say unto you that

20
01:43:55,0 --> 01:43:55,0
he can also lift up his voice in

21
01:43:55,0 --> 01:58:56,
meetings, whenever it shall be expedient.

22
01:58:56,0 --> 01:58:56,0
3 And again, I say unto you that

23
01:58:56,0 --> 01:58:56,0
it shall be appointed unto him to

24
01:58:56,0 --> 01:58:56,0
keep the church record and

25
01:58:56,0 --> 01:58:56,0
history continually; for Oliver

26
01:58:56,0 --> 02:00:00,
Cowdery I have appointed to another office.

27
02:00:00,0 --> 02:00:00,0
4 Wherefore, it shall be given

28
02:00:00,0 --> 02:00:00,0
him, inasmuch as he is

29
02:00:00,0 --> 02:00:00,0
faithful, by the Comforter, to write

30
02:00:00,0 --> 02:09:03,
these things. Even so. Amen.
