00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:05,846
Section 47 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:05,846 --> 00:00:11,692
the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, March 8, 1831.

3
00:00:11,692 --> 00:00:17,538
John Whitmer, who had already served as a clerk to

4
00:00:17,538 --> 00:00:23,384
the Prophet, initially hesitated when he was

5
00:00:23,384 --> 00:00:29,23
asked to serve as the Church historian and recorder,

6
00:00:29,23 --> 00:00:35,076
replacing Oliver Cowdery. He wrote, “I would

7
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:40,922
rather not do it but observed that the will of the

8
00:00:40,922 --> 00:00:46,768
Lord be done, and if he desires it, I desire that

9
00:00:46,768 --> 00:00:52,614
he would manifest it through Joseph the Seer.”

10
00:00:52,614 --> 00:00:58,46
After Joseph Smith received this revelation, John

11
00:00:58,46 --> 00:01:04,306
Whitmer accepted and served in his appointed

12
00:01:04,306 --> 00:01:10,152
office. 
1–4, John Whitmer is designated to keep the

13
00:01:10,152 --> 00:01:16,994
history of the Church and to write for the Prophet. 

14
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:22,594
1 Behold, it is expedient in me that my

15
00:01:22,594 --> 00:01:28,194
servant John should write and keep a regular

16
00:01:28,194 --> 00:01:33,794
history, and assist you, my servant Joseph,

17
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:39,394
in transcribing all things which shall be

18
00:01:39,394 --> 00:01:44,621
given you, until he is called to further duties.

19
00:01:44,621 --> 00:01:45,954
2 Again, verily I say unto you that

20
00:01:45,954 --> 00:01:47,287
he can also lift up his voice in

21
00:01:47,287 --> 00:01:48,742
meetings, whenever it shall be expedient.

22
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:53,342
3 And again, I say unto you that

23
00:01:53,342 --> 00:01:57,942
it shall be appointed unto him to

24
00:01:57,942 --> 00:02:02,542
keep the church record and

25
00:02:02,542 --> 00:02:07,142
history continually; for Oliver

26
00:02:07,142 --> 00:02:11,315
Cowdery I have appointed to another office.

27
00:02:11,315 --> 00:02:12,565
4 Wherefore, it shall be given

28
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:13,815
him, inasmuch as he is

29
00:02:13,815 --> 00:02:15,065
faithful, by the Comforter, to write

30
00:02:15,065 --> 00:02:16,386
these things. Even so. Amen.
