Section 99 Revelation given through Joseph

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Smith the Prophet to John Murdock, August 29,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
1832, at Hiram, Ohio. For over a year, John

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Murdock had been preaching the gospel while his

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
children—motherless after the death of his

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
wife, Julia Clapp, in April 1831—resided with

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
other families in Ohio. 
1–8, John Murdock is

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
called to proclaim the gospel, and those who

9
00:00:00,0 --> 01:14:25,
receive him receive the Lord and will obtain mercy. 

10
01:14:25,0 --> 01:14:25,0
1 Behold, thus saith the Lord unto my

11
01:14:25,0 --> 01:14:25,0
servant John Murdock—thou art called to go

12
01:14:25,0 --> 01:14:25,0
into the eastern countries from house

13
01:14:25,0 --> 01:14:25,0
to house, from village to village, and

14
01:14:25,0 --> 01:14:25,0
from city to city, to proclaim mine

15
01:14:25,0 --> 01:14:25,0
everlasting gospel unto the inhabitants

16
01:14:25,0 --> 01:33:24,
thereof, in the midst of persecution and wickedness.

17
01:33:24,0 --> 01:33:24,0
2 And who receiveth you

18
01:33:24,0 --> 01:33:24,0
receiveth me; and you shall have

19
01:33:24,0 --> 01:33:24,0
power to declare my word in the

20
01:33:24,0 --> 01:38:28,
demonstration of my Holy Spirit.

21
01:38:28,0 --> 01:38:28,0
3 And who receiveth you as a

22
01:38:28,0 --> 01:38:28,0
little child, receiveth my

23
01:38:28,0 --> 01:38:28,0
kingdom; and blessed are

24
01:38:28,0 --> 01:45:31,
they, for they shall obtain mercy.

25
01:45:31,0 --> 01:45:31,0
4 And whoso rejecteth you

26
01:45:31,0 --> 01:45:31,0
shall be rejected of my

27
01:45:31,0 --> 01:45:31,0
Father and his house; and you

28
01:45:31,0 --> 01:45:31,0
shall cleanse your feet in

29
01:45:31,0 --> 01:45:31,0
the secret places by the way

30
01:45:31,0 --> 01:58:35,
for a testimony against them.

31
01:58:35,0 --> 01:58:35,0
5 And behold, and lo, I

32
01:58:35,0 --> 01:58:35,0
come quickly to judgment,

33
01:58:35,0 --> 01:58:35,0
to convince all of their

34
01:58:35,0 --> 01:58:35,0
ungodly deeds which they

35
01:58:35,0 --> 01:58:35,0
have committed against

36
01:58:35,0 --> 01:58:35,0
me, as it is written of me

37
01:58:35,0 --> 02:11:39,
in the volume of the book.

38
02:11:39,0 --> 02:11:39,0
6 And now, verily I

39
02:11:39,0 --> 02:11:39,0
say unto you, that it is

40
02:11:39,0 --> 02:11:39,0
not expedient that

41
02:11:39,0 --> 02:11:39,0
you should go until your

42
02:11:39,0 --> 02:11:39,0
children are provided

43
02:11:39,0 --> 02:11:39,0
for, and sent up

44
02:11:39,0 --> 02:31:16,
kindly unto the bishop of Zion.

45
02:31:16,0 --> 02:31:16,0
7 And after a few

46
02:31:16,0 --> 02:31:16,0
years, if thou

47
02:31:16,0 --> 02:31:16,0
desirest of me, thou mayest

48
02:31:16,0 --> 02:31:16,0
go up also unto the

49
02:31:16,0 --> 02:31:16,0
goodly land, to

50
02:31:16,0 --> 02:52:19,
possess thine inheritance;

51
02:52:19,0 --> 02:52:19,0
8 Otherwise thou

52
02:52:19,0 --> 02:52:19,0
shalt continue

53
02:52:19,0 --> 02:52:19,0
proclaiming my

54
02:52:19,0 --> 02:52:19,0
gospel until thou

55
02:52:19,0 --> 03:07:21,
be taken. Amen.
