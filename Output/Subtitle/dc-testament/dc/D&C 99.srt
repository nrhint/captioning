Section 99 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

00:00:18,389 --> 00:00:25,5
 the Prophet to John Murdock, August 29, 1832, at

3
00:00:25,5 --> 00:00:32,611
 Hiram, Ohio. For over a year, John Murdock had been

4
00:00:32,611 --> 00:00:39,722
 preaching the gospel while his children—motherless

5
00:00:39,722 --> 00:00:46,833
 after the death of his wife, Julia Clapp, in

6
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:53,944
 April 1831—resided with other families in Ohio. 
1–8,

7
00:00:53,944 --> 00:01:01,055
 John Murdock is called to proclaim the gospel, and

8
00:01:01,055 --> 00:01:08,166
 those who receive him receive the Lord and will

9
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:15,277
 obtain mercy.

10
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:20,208
1 Behold, thus saith the Lord unto my servant John

11
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:25,208
 Murdock—thou art called to go into the eastern

12
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:30,208
 countries from house to house, from village to

13
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:35,208
 village, and from city to city, to proclaim mine

14
00:01:35,208 --> 00:01:40,208
 everlasting gospel unto the inhabitants thereof, in the

15
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:45,208
 midst of persecution and wickedness

16
00:01:45,956 --> 00:01:50,623
2 And who receiveth you receiveth me; and you

17
00:01:50,623 --> 00:01:55,29
 shall have power to declare my word in the

18
00:01:55,29 --> 00:01:59,957
 demonstration of my Holy Spirit

19
00:01:59,236 --> 00:02:03,569
3 And who receiveth you as a little child,

20
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:07,902
 receiveth my kingdom; and blessed are they, for they

21
00:02:07,902 --> 00:02:12,235
 shall obtain mercy

22
00:02:12,0 --> 00:02:17,75
4 And whoso rejecteth you shall be rejected of my

23
00:02:17,75 --> 00:02:22,5
 Father and his house; and you shall cleanse your

24
00:02:22,5 --> 00:02:27,25
 feet in the secret places by the way for a

25
00:02:27,25 --> 00:02:31,0
 testimony against them

26
00:02:31,768 --> 00:02:37,268
5 And behold, and lo, I come quickly to judgment,

27
00:02:37,268 --> 00:02:42,768
 to convince all of their ungodly deeds which they

28
00:02:42,768 --> 00:02:48,268
 have committed against me, as it is written of me

29
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:53,768
 in the volume of the book

30
00:02:53,04 --> 00:02:57,04
6 And now, verily I say unto you, that it is not

31
00:02:57,04 --> 00:03:01,04
 expedient that you should go until your children

32
00:03:01,04 --> 00:03:05,04
 are provided for, and sent up kindly unto the bishop

33
00:03:05,04 --> 00:03:09,04
 of Zion

34
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:13,355
7 And after a few years, if thou desirest of me,

35
00:03:13,355 --> 00:03:17,688
 thou mayest go up also unto the goodly land, to

36
00:03:17,688 --> 00:03:22,021
 possess thine inheritance

37
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:29,286
8 Otherwise thou shalt continue proclaiming my

38
00:03:29,286 --> 00:03:35,786
 gospel until thou be taken. Amen.
