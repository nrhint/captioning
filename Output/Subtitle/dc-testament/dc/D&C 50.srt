00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 50 Revelation given through Joseph

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, May 9, 1831.

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Joseph Smith’s history states that some of the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
elders did not understand the manifestations of

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
different spirits abroad in the earth and that

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
this revelation was given in response to his

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
special inquiry on the matter. So-called

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
spiritual phenomena were not uncommon among the

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
members, some of whom claimed to be receiving visions

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and revelations. 
1–5, Many false spirits are

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
abroad in the earth; 
6–9, Wo unto the

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
hypocrites and those who are cut off from the Church;

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
10–14, Elders are to preach the gospel by the

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Spirit; 
15–22, Both preachers and hearers need

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
to be enlightened by the Spirit; 
23–25, That

16
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
which doth not edify is not of God; 
26–28, The

17
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
faithful are possessors of all things; 
29–36,

18
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
The prayers of the purified are answered;

19
00:00:00,0 --> 02:06:48,
37–46, Christ is the Good Shepherd and the Stone of Israel. 

20
02:06:48,0 --> 02:06:48,0
1 Hearken, O ye elders of my church, and

21
02:06:48,0 --> 02:06:48,0
give ear to the voice of the living God; and

22
02:06:48,0 --> 02:06:48,0
attend to the words of wisdom which shall be

23
02:06:48,0 --> 02:06:48,0
given unto you, according as ye have asked

24
02:06:48,0 --> 02:06:48,0
and are agreed as touching the church, and the

25
02:06:48,0 --> 02:07:52,
spirits which have gone abroad in the earth.

26
02:07:52,0 --> 02:07:52,0
2 Behold, verily I say unto you,

27
02:07:52,0 --> 02:07:52,0
that there are many spirits which are

28
02:07:52,0 --> 02:07:52,0
false spirits, which have gone

29
02:07:52,0 --> 02:10:54,
forth in the earth, deceiving the world.

30
02:10:54,0 --> 02:10:54,0
3 And also Satan hath

31
02:10:54,0 --> 02:10:54,0
sought to deceive you,

32
02:10:54,0 --> 02:33:55,
that he might overthrow you.

33
02:33:55,0 --> 02:33:55,0
4 Behold, I, the

34
02:33:55,0 --> 02:33:55,0
Lord, have looked upon

35
02:33:55,0 --> 02:33:55,0
you, and have seen

36
02:33:55,0 --> 02:33:55,0
abominations in the

37
02:33:55,0 --> 02:36:57,
church that profess my name.

38
02:36:57,0 --> 02:36:57,0
5 But blessed are

39
02:36:57,0 --> 02:36:57,0
they who are

40
02:36:57,0 --> 02:36:57,0
faithful and endure,

41
02:36:57,0 --> 02:36:57,0
whether in life or in

42
02:36:57,0 --> 02:36:57,0
death, for they shall

43
02:36:57,0 --> 02:42:02,
inherit eternal life.

44
02:42:02,0 --> 02:42:02,0
6 But wo unto them

45
02:42:02,0 --> 02:42:02,0
that are

46
02:42:02,0 --> 02:42:02,0
deceivers and hypocrites,

47
02:42:02,0 --> 02:42:02,0
for, thus saith

48
02:42:02,0 --> 02:42:02,0
the Lord, I will

49
02:42:02,0 --> 02:44:36,
bring them to judgment.

50
02:44:36,0 --> 02:44:36,0
7 Behold, verily

51
02:44:36,0 --> 02:44:36,0
I say unto you,

52
02:44:36,0 --> 02:44:36,0
there are

53
02:44:36,0 --> 02:44:36,0
hypocrites among you, who

54
02:44:36,0 --> 02:44:36,0
have deceived

55
02:44:36,0 --> 02:44:36,0
some, which has

56
02:44:36,0 --> 02:44:36,0
given the adversary

57
02:44:36,0 --> 02:44:36,0
power; but behold

58
02:44:36,0 --> 02:55:08,
such shall be reclaimed;

59
02:55:08,0 --> 02:55:08,0
8 But the

60
02:55:08,0 --> 02:55:08,0
hypocrites shall be

61
02:55:08,0 --> 02:55:08,0
detected and shall

62
02:55:08,0 --> 02:55:08,0
be cut off,

63
02:55:08,0 --> 02:55:08,0
either in life or

64
02:55:08,0 --> 02:55:08,0
in death, even as

65
02:55:08,0 --> 02:55:08,0
I will; and wo

66
02:55:08,0 --> 02:55:08,0
unto them who

67
02:55:08,0 --> 02:55:08,0
are cut off from

68
02:55:08,0 --> 02:55:08,0
my church, for

69
02:55:08,0 --> 02:55:08,0
the same are

70
02:55:08,0 --> 03:07:14,
overcome of the world.

71
03:07:14,0 --> 03:07:14,0
9 Wherefore,

72
03:07:14,0 --> 03:07:14,0
let every man

73
03:07:14,0 --> 03:07:14,0
beware lest he

74
03:07:14,0 --> 03:07:14,0
do that which

75
03:07:14,0 --> 03:07:14,0
is not in

76
03:07:14,0 --> 03:07:14,0
truth and

77
03:07:14,0 --> 03:20:18,
righteousness before me.

78
03:20:18,0 --> 03:20:18,0
10 And now

79
03:20:18,0 --> 03:20:18,0
come, saith the

80
03:20:18,0 --> 03:20:18,0
Lord, by the

81
03:20:18,0 --> 03:20:18,0
Spirit, unto

82
03:20:18,0 --> 03:20:18,0
the elders

83
03:20:18,0 --> 03:20:18,0
of his church,

84
03:20:18,0 --> 03:20:18,0
and let us

85
03:20:18,0 --> 03:20:18,0
reason

86
03:20:18,0 --> 03:20:18,0
together, that ye

87
03:20:18,0 --> 03:26:23,
may understand;

88
03:26:23,0 --> 03:26:23,0
11 Let us

89
03:26:23,0 --> 03:26:23,0
reason even

90
03:26:23,0 --> 03:26:23,0
as a man

91
03:26:23,0 --> 03:26:23,0
reasoneth one

92
03:26:23,0 --> 03:26:23,0
with

93
03:26:23,0 --> 03:31:28,
another face to face.

94
03:31:28,0 --> 03:31:28,0
12 Now,

95
03:31:28,0 --> 03:31:28,0
when a man

96
03:31:28,0 --> 03:31:28,0
reasoneth

97
03:31:28,0 --> 03:31:28,0
he is

98
03:31:28,0 --> 03:31:28,0
understood of

99
03:31:28,0 --> 03:31:28,0
man,

100
03:31:28,0 --> 03:31:28,0
because he

101
03:31:28,0 --> 03:31:28,0
reasoneth as a

102
03:31:28,0 --> 03:31:28,0
man; even

103
03:31:28,0 --> 03:31:28,0
so will I,

104
03:31:28,0 --> 03:31:28,0
the Lord,

105
03:31:28,0 --> 03:31:28,0
reason

106
03:31:28,0 --> 03:31:28,0
with you

107
03:31:28,0 --> 03:50:28,
that you may understand.

108
03:50:28,0 --> 03:50:28,0
13

109
03:50:28,0 --> 03:50:28,0
Wherefore, I

110
03:50:28,0 --> 03:50:28,0
the Lord

111
03:50:28,0 --> 03:50:28,0
ask you

112
03:50:28,0 --> 03:50:28,0
this

113
03:50:28,0 --> 03:50:28,0
question—unto

114
03:50:28,0 --> 03:50:28,0
what were

115
03:50:28,0 --> 04:11:31,
ye ordained?

116
04:11:31,0 --> 04:11:31,0
14 To

117
04:11:31,0 --> 04:11:31,0
preach my

118
04:11:31,0 --> 04:11:31,0
gospel

119
04:11:31,0 --> 04:11:31,0
by the

120
04:11:31,0 --> 04:11:31,0
Spirit,

121
04:11:31,0 --> 04:11:31,0
even the

122
04:11:31,0 --> 04:11:31,0
Comforter

123
04:11:31,0 --> 04:11:31,0
which

124
04:11:31,0 --> 04:11:31,0
was sent

125
04:11:31,0 --> 04:11:31,0
forth to

126
04:11:31,0 --> 04:12:35,
teach the truth.

127
04:12:35,0 --> 04:12:35,0
15 And

128
04:12:35,0 --> 04:12:35,0
then

129
04:12:35,0 --> 04:12:35,0
received

130
04:12:35,0 --> 04:12:35,0
ye

131
04:12:35,0 --> 04:12:35,0
spirits

132
04:12:35,0 --> 04:12:35,0
which ye

133
04:12:35,0 --> 04:12:35,0
could

134
04:12:35,0 --> 04:12:35,0
not

135
04:12:35,0 --> 04:12:35,0
understand,

136
04:12:35,0 --> 04:12:35,0
and

137
04:12:35,0 --> 04:12:35,0
received

138
04:12:35,0 --> 04:12:35,0
them to

139
04:12:35,0 --> 04:12:35,0
be of

140
04:12:35,0 --> 04:12:35,0
God; and

141
04:12:35,0 --> 04:12:35,0
in

142
04:12:35,0 --> 04:23:35,
this are ye justified?

143
04:23:35,0 --> 04:23:35,0
16

144
04:23:35,0 --> 04:23:35,0
Behold ye

145
04:23:35,0 --> 04:23:35,0
shall

146
04:23:35,0 --> 04:23:35,0


147
04:23:35,0 --> 04:23:35,0
answer this

148
04:23:35,0 --> 04:23:35,0


149
04:23:35,0 --> 04:23:35,0
question

150
04:23:35,0 --> 04:23:35,0


151
04:23:35,0 --> 04:23:35,0
yourselves;

152
04:23:35,0 --> 04:23:35,0


153
04:23:35,0 --> 04:23:35,0
nevertheless,

154
04:23:35,0 --> 04:23:35,0
I will

155
04:23:35,0 --> 04:23:35,0
be

156
04:23:35,0 --> 04:23:35,0
merciful

157
04:23:35,0 --> 04:23:35,0
unto

158
04:23:35,0 --> 04:23:35,0
you;

159
04:23:35,0 --> 04:23:35,0
he that

160
04:23:35,0 --> 04:23:35,0
is

161
04:23:35,0 --> 04:23:35,0
weak

162
04:23:35,0 --> 04:23:35,0
among you

163
04:23:35,0 --> 04:23:35,0


164
04:23:35,0 --> 04:26:09,
hereafter shall be made strong.

165
04:26:09,0 --> 04:26:09,0
17

166
04:26:09,0 --> 04:26:09,0
Verily

167
04:26:09,0 --> 04:26:09,0
I say

168
04:26:09,0 --> 04:26:09,0
unto

169
04:26:09,0 --> 04:26:09,0
you,

170
04:26:09,0 --> 04:26:09,0
he

171
04:26:09,0 --> 04:26:09,0
that

172
04:26:09,0 --> 04:26:09,0
is

173
04:26:09,0 --> 04:26:09,0
ordained

174
04:26:09,0 --> 04:26:09,0
of

175
04:26:09,0 --> 04:26:09,0
me and

176
04:26:09,0 --> 04:26:09,0
sent

177
04:26:09,0 --> 04:26:09,0


178
04:26:09,0 --> 04:26:09,0
forth to

179
04:26:09,0 --> 04:26:09,0


180
04:26:09,0 --> 04:26:09,0
preach the

181
04:26:09,0 --> 04:26:09,0
word

182
04:26:09,0 --> 04:26:09,0
of

183
04:26:09,0 --> 04:26:09,0
truth

184
04:26:09,0 --> 04:26:09,0
by

185
04:26:09,0 --> 04:26:09,0
the

186
04:26:09,0 --> 04:26:09,0


187
04:26:09,0 --> 04:26:09,0
Comforter, in

188
04:26:09,0 --> 04:26:09,0
the

189
04:26:09,0 --> 04:26:09,0


190
04:26:09,0 --> 04:26:09,0
Spirit of

191
04:26:09,0 --> 04:26:09,0


192
04:26:09,0 --> 04:26:09,0
truth,

193
04:26:09,0 --> 04:26:09,0
doth he

194
04:26:09,0 --> 04:26:09,0


195
04:26:09,0 --> 04:26:09,0
preach it

196
04:26:09,0 --> 04:26:09,0
by

197
04:26:09,0 --> 04:33:11,
the Spirit of truth or some other way?

198
04:33:11,0 --> 04:33:11,0
18

199
04:33:11,0 --> 04:33:11,0
And

200
04:33:11,0 --> 04:33:11,0
if it

201
04:33:11,0 --> 04:33:11,0

some

04:33:11,0 --> 04:33:11,0
other

04:33:11,0 --> 04:33:11,0
way it

04:33:11,0 --> 04:33:11,0
is

208
04:33:11,0 --> 04:39:46,
not of God.

209
04:39:46,0 --> 04:39:46,0
19

210
04:39:46,0 --> 04:39:46,0
And

he

218
04:39:46,0 --> 04:39:46,0


219
04:39:46,0 --> 04:39:46,0
receiveth

220
04:39:46,0 --> 04:39:46,0
the

221

04:39:46,0 --> 04:39:46,0
word

223

of

224
04:39:46,0 --> 04:39:46,0

04:39:46,0 --> 04:39:46,0
truth,

04:39:46,0 --> 04:39:46,0


227
04:39:46,0 --> 04:39:46,0
doth

228
04:39:46,0 --> 04:39:46,0
