1
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:17,436
Section 50 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:17,436 --> 00:00:23,594
 the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, May 9, 1831. Joseph

3
00:00:23,594 --> 00:00:29,752
 Smith’s history states that some of the elders

4
00:00:29,752 --> 00:00:35,91
 did not understand the manifestations of different

5
00:00:35,91 --> 00:00:42,068
 spirits abroad in the earth and that this

6
00:00:42,068 --> 00:00:48,226
 revelation was given in response to his special inquiry on

7
00:00:48,226 --> 00:00:54,384
 the matter. So-called spiritual phenomena were not

8
00:00:54,384 --> 00:01:00,542
 uncommon among the members, some of whom claimed

9
00:01:00,542 --> 00:01:06,7
 to be receiving visions and revelations. 
1–5,

10
00:01:06,7 --> 00:01:12,858
 Many false spirits are abroad in the earth; 
6–9, Wo

11
00:01:12,858 --> 00:01:19,016
 unto the hypocrites and those who are cut off from

12
00:01:19,016 --> 00:01:25,174
 the Church; 
10–14, Elders are to preach the

13
00:01:25,174 --> 00:01:31,332
 gospel by the Spirit; 
15–22, Both preachers and

14
00:01:31,332 --> 00:01:37,49
 hearers need to be enlightened by the Spirit; 
23–25,

15
00:01:37,49 --> 00:01:43,648
 That which doth not edify is not of God; 
26–28,

16
00:01:43,648 --> 00:01:49,806
 The faithful are possessors of all things; 
29–36,

17
00:01:49,806 --> 00:01:55,964
 The prayers of the purified are answered; 
37–46,

18
00:01:55,964 --> 00:02:02,122
 Christ is the Good Shepherd and the Stone of

19
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:08,28
 Israel.

20
00:02:08,912 --> 00:02:13,245
1 Hearken, O ye elders of my church, and give ear

21
00:02:13,245 --> 00:02:17,578
 to the voice of the living God; and attend to the

22
00:02:17,578 --> 00:02:21,911
 words of wisdom which shall be given unto you,

23
00:02:21,911 --> 00:02:26,244
 according as ye have asked and are agreed as touching

24
00:02:26,244 --> 00:02:30,577
 the church, and the spirits which have gone

25
00:02:30,577 --> 00:02:34,91
 abroad in the earth

26
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:38,572
2 Behold, verily I say unto you, that there are

27
00:02:38,572 --> 00:02:42,239
 many spirits which are false spirits, which have

28
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,906
 gone forth in the earth, deceiving the world

29
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:50,449
3 And also Satan hath sought to deceive you, that

30
00:02:50,449 --> 00:02:55,449
 he might overthrow you

31
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:59,976
4 Behold, I, the Lord, have looked upon you, and

32
00:02:59,976 --> 00:03:03,976
 have seen abominations in the church that profess

33
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:07,976
 my name

34
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:12,655
5 But blessed are they who are faithful and

35
00:03:12,655 --> 00:03:17,322
 endure, whether in life or in death, for they shall

36
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:21,989
 inherit eternal life

37
00:03:21,985 --> 00:03:25,652
6 But wo unto them that are deceivers and

38
00:03:25,652 --> 00:03:29,319
 hypocrites, for, thus saith the Lord, I will bring them to

39
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:32,986
 judgment

40
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:37,262
7 Behold, verily I say unto you, there are

41
00:03:37,262 --> 00:03:42,012
 hypocrites among you, who have deceived some, which has

42
00:03:42,012 --> 00:03:46,762
 given the adversary power; but behold such shall be

43
00:03:46,762 --> 00:03:51,512
 reclaimed

44
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:56,781
8 But the hypocrites shall be detected and shall

45
00:03:56,781 --> 00:04:02,531
 be cut off, either in life or in death, even as I

46
00:04:02,531 --> 00:04:08,281
 will; and wo unto them who are cut off from my

47
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:14,031
 church, for the same are overcome of the world

48
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:18,62
9 Wherefore, let every man beware lest he do that

49
00:04:18,62 --> 00:04:22,953
 which is not in truth and righteousness before me

50
00:04:22,953 --> 00:04:27,286


51
00:04:27,3 --> 00:04:31,633
10 And now come, saith the Lord, by the Spirit,

52
00:04:31,633 --> 00:04:35,966
 unto the elders of his church, and let us reason

53
00:04:35,966 --> 00:04:40,299
 together, that ye may understand

54
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:45,314
11 Let us reason even as a man reasoneth one with

55
00:04:45,314 --> 00:04:49,814
 another face to face

56
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:54,622
12 Now, when a man reasoneth he is understood of

57
00:04:54,622 --> 00:04:59,872
 man, because he reasoneth as a man; even so will I,

58
00:04:59,872 --> 00:05:05,122
 the Lord, reason with you that you may

59
00:05:05,122 --> 00:05:10,372
 understand

60
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:15,377
13 Wherefore, I the Lord ask you this

61
00:05:15,377 --> 00:05:19,877
 question—unto what were ye ordained

62
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:26,686
14 To preach my gospel by the Spirit, even the

63
00:05:26,686 --> 00:05:34,186
 Comforter which was sent forth to teach the truth

64
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:40,118
15 And then received ye spirits which ye could not

65
00:05:40,118 --> 00:05:45,785
 understand, and received them to be of God; and

66
00:05:45,785 --> 00:05:51,452
 in this are ye justified

67
00:05:51,735 --> 00:05:55,735
16 Behold ye shall answer this question

68
00:05:55,735 --> 00:05:59,735
 yourselves; nevertheless, I will be merciful unto you; he

69
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:03,735
 that is weak among you hereafter shall be made

70
00:06:03,735 --> 00:06:07,735
 strong

71
00:06:07,484 --> 00:06:13,984
17 Verily I say unto you, he that is ordained of

72
00:06:13,984 --> 00:06:20,484
 me and sent forth to preach the word of truth by

73
00:06:20,484 --> 00:06:26,984
 the Comforter, in the Spirit of truth, doth he

74
00:06:26,984 --> 00:06:33,484
 preach it by the Spirit of truth or some other way

75
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:36,994
18 And if it be by some other way it is not of

76
00:06:36,994 --> 00:06:39,994
 God

77
00:06:39,282 --> 00:06:43,949
19 And again, he that receiveth the word of truth,

78
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:48,616
 doth he receive it by the Spirit of truth or some

79
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:53,283
 other way

80
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:58,046
20 If it be some other way it is not of God

81
00:06:58,068 --> 00:07:03,568
21 Therefore, why is it that ye cannot understand

82
00:07:03,568 --> 00:07:09,068
 and know, that he that receiveth the word by the

83
00:07:09,068 --> 00:07:14,568
 Spirit of truth receiveth it as it is preached by

84
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:20,068
 the Spirit of truth

85
00:07:20,824 --> 00:07:25,491
22 Wherefore, he that preacheth and he that

86
00:07:25,491 --> 00:07:30,158
 receiveth, understand one another, and both are edified

87
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:34,825
 and rejoice together

88
00:07:34,104 --> 00:07:38,104
23 And that which doth not edify is not of God,

89
00:07:38,104 --> 00:07:42,104
 and is darkness

90
00:07:42,912 --> 00:07:47,162
24 That which is of God is light; and he that

91
00:07:47,162 --> 00:07:51,412
 receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more

92
00:07:51,412 --> 00:07:55,662
 light; and that light groweth brighter and

93
00:07:55,662 --> 00:07:59,912
 brighter until the perfect day

94
00:07:59,963 --> 00:08:05,63
25 And again, verily I say unto you, and I say it

95
00:08:05,63 --> 00:08:11,297
 that you may know the truth, that you may chase

96
00:08:11,297 --> 00:08:16,964
 darkness from among you

97
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:21,595
26 He that is ordained of God and sent forth, the

98
00:08:21,595 --> 00:08:26,928
 same is appointed to be the greatest,

99
00:08:26,928 --> 00:08:32,261
 notwithstanding he is the least and the servant of all

100
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:37,412
27 Wherefore, he is possessor of all things; for

101
00:08:37,412 --> 00:08:42,212
 all things are subject unto him, both in heaven and

102
00:08:42,212 --> 00:08:47,012
 on the earth, the life and the light, the Spirit

103
00:08:47,012 --> 00:08:51,812
 and the power, sent forth by the will of the

104
00:08:51,812 --> 00:08:56,612
 Father through Jesus Christ, his Son

105
00:08:56,903 --> 00:09:03,403
28 But no man is possessor of all things except he

106
00:09:03,403 --> 00:09:09,903
 be purified and cleansed from all sin

107
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:14,583
29 And if ye are purified and cleansed from all

108
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:19,25
 sin, ye shall ask whatsoever you will in the name of

109
00:09:19,25 --> 00:09:23,917
 Jesus and it shall be done

110
00:09:23,913 --> 00:09:29,913
30 But know this, it shall be given you what you

111
00:09:29,913 --> 00:09:35,913
 shall ask; and as ye are appointed to the head, the

112
00:09:35,913 --> 00:09:41,913
 spirits shall be subject unto you

113
00:09:41,431 --> 00:09:46,098
31 Wherefore, it shall come to pass, that if you

114
00:09:46,098 --> 00:09:50,765
 behold a spirit manifested that you cannot

115
00:09:50,765 --> 00:09:55,432
 understand, and you receive not that spirit, ye shall ask

116
00:09:55,432 --> 00:10:00,099
 of the Father in the name of Jesus; and if he give

117
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:04,766
 not unto you that spirit, then you may know that

118
00:10:04,766 --> 00:10:09,433
 it is not of God

119
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:13,175
32 And it shall be given unto you, power over that

120
00:10:13,175 --> 00:10:17,175
 spirit; and you shall proclaim against that

121
00:10:17,175 --> 00:10:21,175
 spirit with a loud voice that it is not of God

122
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:25,888
33 Not with railing accusation, that ye be not

123
00:10:25,888 --> 00:10:30,555
 overcome, neither with boasting nor rejoicing, lest

124
00:10:30,555 --> 00:10:35,222
 you be seized therewith

125
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:39,551
34 He that receiveth of God, let him account it of

126
00:10:39,551 --> 00:10:43,884
 God; and let him rejoice that he is accounted of

127
00:10:43,884 --> 00:10:48,217
 God worthy to receive

128
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:53,131
35 And by giving heed and doing these things which

129
00:10:53,131 --> 00:10:57,531
 ye have received, and which ye shall hereafter

130
00:10:57,531 --> 00:11:01,931
 receive—and the kingdom is given you of the Father,

131
00:11:01,931 --> 00:11:06,331
 and power to overcome all things which are not

132
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:10,731
 ordained of him

133
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:15,237
36 And behold, verily I say unto you, blessed are

134
00:11:15,237 --> 00:11:19,737
 you who are now hearing these words of mine from

135
00:11:19,737 --> 00:11:24,237
 the mouth of my servant, for your sins are forgiven

136
00:11:24,237 --> 00:11:28,737
 you

137
00:11:28,738 --> 00:11:34,488
37 Let my servant Joseph Wakefield, in whom I am

138
00:11:34,488 --> 00:11:40,238
 well pleased, and my servant Parley P. Pratt go

139
00:11:40,238 --> 00:11:45,988
 forth among the churches and strengthen them by the

140
00:11:45,988 --> 00:11:51,738
 word of exhortation

141
00:11:51,01 --> 00:11:56,01
38 And also my servant John Corrill, or as many of

142
00:11:56,01 --> 00:12:01,01
 my servants as are ordained unto this office, and

143
00:12:01,01 --> 00:12:06,01
 let them labor in the vineyard; and let no man

144
00:12:06,01 --> 00:12:11,01
 hinder them doing that which I have appointed unto

145
00:12:11,01 --> 00:12:16,01
 them

146
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:21,635
39 Wherefore, in this thing my servant Edward

147
00:12:21,635 --> 00:12:26,968
 Partridge is not justified; nevertheless let him

148
00:12:26,968 --> 00:12:32,301
 repent and he shall be forgiven

149
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:36,718
40 Behold, ye are little children and ye cannot

150
00:12:36,718 --> 00:12:41,385
 bear all things now; ye must grow in grace and in

151
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:46,052
 the knowledge of the truth

152
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:51,5
41 Fear not, little children, for you are mine,

153
00:12:51,5 --> 00:12:56,167
 and I have overcome the world, and you are of them

154
00:12:56,167 --> 00:13:00,834
 that my Father hath given me

155
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:03,113
42 And none of them that my Father hath given me

156
00:13:03,113 --> 00:13:06,113
 shall be lost

157
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:11,752
43 And the Father and I are one. I am in the

158
00:13:11,752 --> 00:13:17,085
 Father and the Father in me; and inasmuch as ye have

159
00:13:17,085 --> 00:13:22,418
 received me, ye are in me and I in you

160
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:28,735
44 Wherefore, I am in your midst, and I am the

161
00:13:28,735 --> 00:13:34,735
 good shepherd, and the stone of Israel. He that

162
00:13:34,735 --> 00:13:40,735
 buildeth upon this rock shall never fall

163
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:45,019
45 And the day cometh that you shall hear my voice

164
00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:50,019
 and see me, and know that I am

165
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:55,079
46 Watch, therefore, that ye may be ready. Even

166
00:13:55,079 --> 00:14:00,079
 so. Amen.
