1
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:18,278
Section 110 Visions manifested to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:18,278 --> 00:00:25,278
 Prophet and Oliver Cowdery in the temple at

3
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:32,278
 Kirtland, Ohio, April 3, 1836. The occasion was that of

4
00:00:32,278 --> 00:00:39,278
 a Sabbath day meeting. Joseph Smith’s history

5
00:00:39,278 --> 00:00:46,278
 states: “In the afternoon, I assisted the other

6
00:00:46,278 --> 00:00:53,278
 Presidents in distributing the Lord’s Supper to the

7
00:00:53,278 --> 00:01:00,278
 Church, receiving it from the Twelve, whose privilege

8
00:01:00,278 --> 00:01:07,278
 it was to officiate at the sacred desk this day.

9
00:01:07,278 --> 00:01:14,278
 After having performed this service to my

10
00:01:14,278 --> 00:01:21,278
 brethren, I retired to the pulpit, the veils being

11
00:01:21,278 --> 00:01:28,278
 dropped, and bowed myself, with Oliver Cowdery, in solemn

12
00:01:28,278 --> 00:01:35,278
 and silent prayer. After rising from prayer, the

13
00:01:35,278 --> 00:01:42,278
 following vision was opened to both of us.” 
1–10,

14
00:01:42,278 --> 00:01:49,278
 The Lord Jehovah appears in glory and accepts the

15
00:01:49,278 --> 00:01:56,278
 Kirtland Temple as His house; 
11–12, Moses and

16
00:01:56,278 --> 00:02:03,278
 Elias each appear and commit their keys and

17
00:02:03,278 --> 00:02:10,278
 dispensations; 
13–16, Elijah returns and commits the

18
00:02:10,278 --> 00:02:17,278
 keys of his dispensation as promised by Malachi.

19
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:23,138
1 The veil was taken from our minds, and the eyes

20
00:02:23,138 --> 00:02:28,638
 of our understanding were opened

21
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:34,982
2 We saw the Lord standing upon the breastwork of

22
00:02:34,982 --> 00:02:41,315
 the pulpit, before us; and under his feet was a

23
00:02:41,315 --> 00:02:47,648
 paved work of pure gold, in color like amber

24
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:53,767
3 His eyes were as a flame of fire; the hair of

25
00:02:53,767 --> 00:03:00,367
 his head was white like the pure snow; his

26
00:03:00,367 --> 00:03:06,967
 countenance shone above the brightness of the sun; and his

27
00:03:06,967 --> 00:03:13,567
 voice was as the sound of the rushing of great

28
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:20,167
 waters, even the voice of Jehovah, saying

29
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:27,167
4 I am the first and the last; I am he who liveth,

30
00:03:27,167 --> 00:03:34,167
 I am he who was slain; I am your advocate with

31
00:03:34,167 --> 00:03:41,167
 the Father

32
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:45,838
5 Behold, your sins are forgiven you; you are

33
00:03:45,838 --> 00:03:50,505
 clean before me; therefore, lift up your heads and

34
00:03:50,505 --> 00:03:55,172
 rejoice

35
00:03:55,936 --> 00:04:01,603
6 Let the hearts of your brethren rejoice, and let

36
00:04:01,603 --> 00:04:07,27
 the hearts of all my people rejoice, who have,

37
00:04:07,27 --> 00:04:12,937
 with their might, built this house to my name

38
00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:17,469
7 For behold, I have accepted this house, and my

39
00:04:17,469 --> 00:04:22,469
 name shall be here; and I will manifest myself to

40
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:27,469
 my people in mercy in this house

41
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:31,984
8 Yea, I will appear unto my servants, and speak

42
00:04:31,984 --> 00:04:36,734
 unto them with mine own voice, if my people will

43
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:41,484
 keep my commandments, and do not pollute this holy

44
00:04:41,484 --> 00:04:46,234
 house

45
00:04:46,236 --> 00:04:50,636
9 Yea the hearts of thousands and tens of

46
00:04:50,636 --> 00:04:55,036
 thousands shall greatly rejoice in consequence of the

47
00:04:55,036 --> 00:04:59,436
 blessings which shall be poured out, and the endowment

48
00:04:59,436 --> 00:05:03,836
 with which my servants have been endowed in this

49
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:08,236
 house

50
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:13,008
10 And the fame of this house shall spread to

51
00:05:13,008 --> 00:05:17,508
 foreign lands; and this is the beginning of the

52
00:05:17,508 --> 00:05:22,008
 blessing which shall be poured out upon the heads of my

53
00:05:22,008 --> 00:05:26,508
 people. Even so. Amen

54
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:32,46
11 After this vision closed, the heavens were

55
00:05:32,46 --> 00:05:38,127
 again opened unto us; and Moses appeared before us,

56
00:05:38,127 --> 00:05:43,794
 and committed unto us the keys of the gathering of

57
00:05:43,794 --> 00:05:49,461
 Israel from the four parts of the earth, and the

58
00:05:49,461 --> 00:05:55,128
 leading of the ten tribes from the land of the

59
00:05:55,128 --> 00:06:00,795
 north

60
00:06:00,544 --> 00:06:06,044
12 After this, Elias appeared, and committed the

61
00:06:06,044 --> 00:06:11,544
 dispensation of the gospel of Abraham, saying that

62
00:06:11,544 --> 00:06:17,044
 in us and our seed all generations after us should

63
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:22,544
 be blessed

64
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:28,299
13 After this vision had closed, another great and

65
00:06:28,299 --> 00:06:34,049
 glorious vision burst upon us; for Elijah the

66
00:06:34,049 --> 00:06:39,799
 prophet, who was taken to heaven without tasting

67
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:45,549
 death, stood before us, and said

68
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:51,322
14 Behold, the time has fully come, which was

69
00:06:51,322 --> 00:06:57,072
 spoken of by the mouth of Malachi—testifying that he

70
00:06:57,072 --> 00:07:02,822
 [Elijah] should be sent, before the great and

71
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:08,572
 dreadful day of the Lord come

72
00:07:08,078 --> 00:07:13,411
15 To turn the hearts of the fathers to the

73
00:07:13,411 --> 00:07:18,744
 children, and the children to the fathers, lest the

74
00:07:18,744 --> 00:07:24,077
 whole earth be smitten with a curse

75
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:29,877
16 Therefore, the keys of this dispensation are

76
00:07:29,877 --> 00:07:35,377
 committed into your hands; and by this ye may know

77
00:07:35,377 --> 00:07:40,877
 that the great and dreadful day of the Lord is

78
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:46,377
 near, even at the doors.
