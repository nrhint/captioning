00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 110 Visions manifested to Joseph Smith

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Prophet and Oliver Cowdery in the temple at

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Kirtland, Ohio, April 3, 1836. The occasion was that

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of a Sabbath day meeting. Joseph Smith’s history

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
states: “In the afternoon, I assisted the other

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Presidents in distributing the Lord’s Supper to

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Church, receiving it from the Twelve, whose

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
privilege it was to officiate at the sacred desk

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
this day. After having performed this service to my

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
brethren, I retired to the pulpit, the veils

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
being dropped, and bowed myself, with Oliver

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Cowdery, in solemn and silent prayer. After rising from

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
prayer, the following vision was opened to both

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of us.” 
1–10, The Lord Jehovah appears in glory

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and accepts the Kirtland Temple as His house;

16
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
11–12, Moses and Elias each appear and commit their

17
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
keys and dispensations; 
13–16, Elijah returns

18
00:00:00,0 --> 02:16:47,
and commits the keys of his dispensation as promised by Malachi. 

19
02:16:47,0 --> 02:16:47,0
1 The veil was taken from our minds, and

20
02:16:47,0 --> 02:27:47,
the eyes of our understanding were opened.

21
02:27:47,0 --> 02:27:47,0
2 We saw the Lord standing upon the

22
02:27:47,0 --> 02:27:47,0
breastwork of the pulpit, before

23
02:27:47,0 --> 02:27:47,0
us; and under his feet was a paved

24
02:27:47,0 --> 02:46:47,
work of pure gold, in color like amber.

25
02:46:47,0 --> 02:46:47,0
3 His eyes were as a flame of

26
02:46:47,0 --> 02:46:47,0
fire; the hair of his head was white

27
02:46:47,0 --> 02:46:47,0
like the pure snow; his countenance

28
02:46:47,0 --> 02:46:47,0
shone above the brightness of the

29
02:46:47,0 --> 02:46:47,0
sun; and his voice was as the

30
02:46:47,0 --> 02:46:47,0
sound of the rushing of great waters,

31
02:46:47,0 --> 03:17:47,
even the voice of Jehovah, saying:

32
03:17:47,0 --> 03:17:47,0
4 I am the first and the

33
03:17:47,0 --> 03:17:47,0
last; I am he who liveth, I

34
03:17:47,0 --> 03:17:47,0
am he who was slain; I am

35
03:17:47,0 --> 03:18:51,
your advocate with the Father.

36
03:18:51,0 --> 03:18:51,0
5 Behold, your sins are

37
03:18:51,0 --> 03:18:51,0
forgiven you; you are clean

38
03:18:51,0 --> 03:18:51,0
before me; therefore, lift

39
03:18:51,0 --> 03:39:54,
up your heads and rejoice.

40
03:39:54,0 --> 03:39:54,0
6 Let the hearts of your

41
03:39:54,0 --> 03:39:54,0
brethren rejoice, and

42
03:39:54,0 --> 03:39:54,0
let the hearts of all my

43
03:39:54,0 --> 03:39:54,0
people rejoice, who

44
03:39:54,0 --> 03:39:54,0
have, with their might,

45
03:39:54,0 --> 03:54:56,
built this house to my name.

46
03:54:56,0 --> 03:54:56,0
7 For behold, I have

47
03:54:56,0 --> 03:54:56,0
accepted this house,

48
03:54:56,0 --> 03:54:56,0
and my name shall be

49
03:54:56,0 --> 03:54:56,0
here; and I will manifest

50
03:54:56,0 --> 03:54:56,0
myself to my people

51
03:54:56,0 --> 04:09:58,
in mercy in this house.

52
04:09:58,0 --> 04:09:58,0
8 Yea, I will

53
04:09:58,0 --> 04:09:58,0
appear unto my servants,

54
04:09:58,0 --> 04:09:58,0
and speak unto

55
04:09:58,0 --> 04:09:58,0
them with mine own

56
04:09:58,0 --> 04:09:58,0
voice, if my people

57
04:09:58,0 --> 04:09:58,0
will keep my

58
04:09:58,0 --> 04:09:58,0
commandments, and do not

59
04:09:58,0 --> 04:11:02,
pollute this holy house.

60
04:11:02,0 --> 04:11:02,0
9 Yea the hearts

61
04:11:02,0 --> 04:11:02,0
of thousands and

62
04:11:02,0 --> 04:11:02,0
tens of thousands

63
04:11:02,0 --> 04:11:02,0
shall greatly

64
04:11:02,0 --> 04:11:02,0
rejoice in consequence

65
04:11:02,0 --> 04:11:02,0
of the blessings

66
04:11:02,0 --> 04:11:02,0
which shall be

67
04:11:02,0 --> 04:11:02,0
poured out, and the

68
04:11:02,0 --> 04:11:02,0
endowment with which

69
04:11:02,0 --> 04:11:02,0
my servants have

70
04:11:02,0 --> 04:26:04,
been endowed in this house.

71
04:26:04,0 --> 04:26:04,0
10 And the fame

72
04:26:04,0 --> 04:26:04,0
of this house

73
04:26:04,0 --> 04:26:04,0
shall spread to

74
04:26:04,0 --> 04:26:04,0
foreign lands; and

75
04:26:04,0 --> 04:26:04,0
this is the

76
04:26:04,0 --> 04:26:04,0
beginning of the blessing

77
04:26:04,0 --> 04:26:04,0
which shall be

78
04:26:04,0 --> 04:26:04,0
poured out upon

79
04:26:04,0 --> 04:26:04,0
the heads of my

80
04:26:04,0 --> 04:44:36,
people. Even so. Amen.

81
04:44:36,0 --> 04:44:36,0
11 After this

82
04:44:36,0 --> 04:44:36,0
vision closed, the

83
04:44:36,0 --> 04:44:36,0
heavens were

84
04:44:36,0 --> 04:44:36,0
again opened unto

85
04:44:36,0 --> 04:44:36,0
us; and Moses

86
04:44:36,0 --> 04:44:36,0
appeared before

87
04:44:36,0 --> 04:44:36,0
us, and committed

88
04:44:36,0 --> 04:44:36,0
unto us the keys

89
04:44:36,0 --> 04:44:36,0
of the

90
04:44:36,0 --> 04:44:36,0
gathering of Israel from

91
04:44:36,0 --> 04:44:36,0
the four parts

92
04:44:36,0 --> 04:44:36,0
of the earth,

93
04:44:36,0 --> 04:44:36,0
and the leading of

94
04:44:36,0 --> 04:44:36,0
the ten tribes

95
04:44:36,0 --> 05:07:37,
from the land of the north.

96
05:07:37,0 --> 05:07:37,0
12 After this,

97
05:07:37,0 --> 05:07:37,0
Elias

98
05:07:37,0 --> 05:07:37,0
appeared, and

99
05:07:37,0 --> 05:07:37,0
committed the

100
05:07:37,0 --> 05:07:37,0
dispensation of the

101
05:07:37,0 --> 05:07:37,0
gospel of

102
05:07:37,0 --> 05:07:37,0
Abraham, saying

103
05:07:37,0 --> 05:07:37,0
that in us and

104
05:07:37,0 --> 05:07:37,0
our seed all

105
05:07:37,0 --> 05:07:37,0
generations after

106
05:07:37,0 --> 05:03:17,
us should be blessed.

107
05:03:17,0 --> 05:03:17,0
13 After this

108
05:03:17,0 --> 05:03:17,0
vision had

109
05:03:17,0 --> 05:03:17,0
closed,

110
05:03:17,0 --> 05:03:17,0
another great and

111
05:03:17,0 --> 05:03:17,0
glorious

112
05:03:17,0 --> 05:03:17,0
vision burst upon

113
05:03:17,0 --> 05:03:17,0
us; for

114
05:03:17,0 --> 05:03:17,0
Elijah the

115
05:03:17,0 --> 05:03:17,0
prophet, who was

116
05:03:17,0 --> 05:03:17,0
taken to heaven

117
05:03:17,0 --> 05:03:17,0
without

118
05:03:17,0 --> 05:03:17,0
tasting death,

119
05:03:17,0 --> 05:07:24,
stood before us, and said:

120
05:07:24,0 --> 05:07:24,0
14 Behold,

121
05:07:24,0 --> 05:07:24,0
the time has

122
05:07:24,0 --> 05:07:24,0
fully come,

123
05:07:24,0 --> 05:07:24,0
which was

124
05:07:24,0 --> 05:07:24,0
spoken of by

125
05:07:24,0 --> 05:07:24,0
the mouth of

126
05:07:24,0 --> 05:07:24,0


127
05:07:24,0 --> 05:07:24,0
Malachi—testifying that

128
05:07:24,0 --> 05:07:24,0
he [Elijah]

129
05:07:24,0 --> 05:07:24,0
should be

130
05:07:24,0 --> 05:07:24,0
sent, before

131
05:07:24,0 --> 05:07:24,0
the great and

132
05:07:24,0 --> 05:07:24,0
dreadful

133
05:07:24,0 --> 05:03:04,
day of the Lord come—

134
05:03:04,0 --> 05:03:04,0
15 To turn

135
05:03:04,0 --> 05:03:04,0
the hearts of

136
05:03:04,0 --> 05:03:04,0
the fathers

137
05:03:04,0 --> 05:03:04,0
to the

138
05:03:04,0 --> 05:03:04,0
children, and

139
05:03:04,0 --> 05:03:04,0
the children

140
05:03:04,0 --> 05:03:04,0
to the

141
05:03:04,0 --> 05:03:04,0
fathers, lest the

142
05:03:04,0 --> 05:03:04,0
whole earth

143
05:03:04,0 --> 05:03:04,0
be smitten

144
05:03:04,0 --> 05:07:41,
with a curse—

145
05:07:41,0 --> 05:07:41,0
16

146
05:07:41,0 --> 05:07:41,0
Therefore, the keys

147
05:07:41,0 --> 05:07:41,0
of this

148
05:07:41,0 --> 05:07:41,0
dispensation

149
05:07:41,0 --> 05:07:41,0
are

150
05:07:41,0 --> 05:07:41,0
committed into

151
05:07:41,0 --> 05:07:41,0
your hands;

152
05:07:41,0 --> 05:07:41,0
and by this

153
05:07:41,0 --> 05:07:41,0
ye may know

154
05:07:41,0 --> 05:07:41,0
that the

155
05:07:41,0 --> 05:07:41,0
great and

156
05:07:41,0 --> 05:07:41,0
dreadful day

157
05:07:41,0 --> 05:07:41,0
of the Lord

158
05:07:41,0 --> 05:07:41,0
is near,

159
05:07:41,0 --> 05:20:45,
even at the doors.
