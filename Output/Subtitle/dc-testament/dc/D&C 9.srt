00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 9 Revelation given through Joseph

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Smith the Prophet to Oliver Cowdery, at Harmony,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Pennsylvania, April 1829. Oliver is admonished

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
to be patient and is urged to be content to

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
write, for the time being, at the dictation of

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the translator, rather than to attempt to

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
translate. 
1–6, Other ancient records are yet to

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
be translated; 
7–14, The Book of Mormon is

9
00:00:00,0 --> 01:07:31,
translated by study and by spiritual confirmation. 

10
01:07:31,0 --> 01:07:31,0
1 Behold, I say unto you, my son, that

11
01:07:31,0 --> 01:07:31,0
because you did not translate according to

12
01:07:31,0 --> 01:07:31,0
that which you desired of me, and did

13
01:07:31,0 --> 01:07:31,0
commence again to write for my servant,

14
01:07:31,0 --> 01:07:31,0
Joseph Smith, Jun., even so I would that ye

15
01:07:31,0 --> 01:07:31,0
should continue until you have finished

16
01:07:31,0 --> 01:43:34,
this record, which I have entrusted unto him.

17
01:43:34,0 --> 01:43:34,0
2 And then, behold, other records

18
01:43:34,0 --> 01:43:34,0
have I, that I will give unto you

19
01:43:34,0 --> 01:50:36,
power that you may assist to translate.

20
01:50:36,0 --> 01:50:36,0
3 Be patient, my son, for it

21
01:50:36,0 --> 01:50:36,0
is wisdom in me, and it is

22
01:50:36,0 --> 01:50:36,0
not expedient that you should

23
01:50:36,0 --> 01:54:43,
translate at this present time.

24
01:54:43,0 --> 01:54:43,0
4 Behold, the work which

25
01:54:43,0 --> 01:54:43,0
you are called to do is to

26
01:54:43,0 --> 01:57:45,
write for my servant Joseph.

27
01:57:45,0 --> 01:57:45,0
5 And, behold, it is

28
01:57:45,0 --> 01:57:45,0
because that you did not

29
01:57:45,0 --> 01:57:45,0
continue as you commenced,

30
01:57:45,0 --> 01:57:45,0
when you began to

31
01:57:45,0 --> 01:57:45,0
translate, that I have taken

32
01:57:45,0 --> 02:10:49,
away this privilege from you.

33
02:10:49,0 --> 02:10:49,0
6 Do not murmur, my

34
02:10:49,0 --> 02:10:49,0
son, for it is wisdom in

35
02:10:49,0 --> 02:10:49,0
me that I have dealt

36
02:10:49,0 --> 02:17:52,
with you after this manner.

37
02:17:52,0 --> 02:17:52,0
7 Behold, you have

38
02:17:52,0 --> 02:17:52,0
not understood; you

39
02:17:52,0 --> 02:17:52,0
have supposed that I

40
02:17:52,0 --> 02:17:52,0
would give it unto you,

41
02:17:52,0 --> 02:17:52,0
when you took no

42
02:17:52,0 --> 02:13:32,
thought save it was to ask me.

43
02:13:32,0 --> 02:13:32,0
8 But, behold, I say

44
02:13:32,0 --> 02:13:32,0
unto you, that you

45
02:13:32,0 --> 02:13:32,0
must study it out in

46
02:13:32,0 --> 02:13:32,0
your mind; then you

47
02:13:32,0 --> 02:13:32,0
must ask me if it

48
02:13:32,0 --> 02:13:32,0
be right, and if it

49
02:13:32,0 --> 02:13:32,0
is right I will cause

50
02:13:32,0 --> 02:13:32,0
that your bosom

51
02:13:32,0 --> 02:13:32,0
shall burn within you;

52
02:13:32,0 --> 02:13:32,0
therefore, you shall

53
02:13:32,0 --> 02:18:37,
feel that it is right.

54
02:18:37,0 --> 02:18:37,0
9 But if it be not

55
02:18:37,0 --> 02:18:37,0
right you shall

56
02:18:37,0 --> 02:18:37,0
have no such feelings,

57
02:18:37,0 --> 02:18:37,0
but you shall have

58
02:18:37,0 --> 02:18:37,0
a stupor of

59
02:18:37,0 --> 02:18:37,0
thought that shall cause

60
02:18:37,0 --> 02:18:37,0
you to forget the

61
02:18:37,0 --> 02:18:37,0
thing which is

62
02:18:37,0 --> 02:18:37,0
wrong; therefore, you

63
02:18:37,0 --> 02:18:37,0
cannot write that

64
02:18:37,0 --> 02:18:37,0
which is sacred save

65
02:18:37,0 --> 02:32:41,
it be given you from me.

66
02:32:41,0 --> 02:32:41,0
10 Now, if you

67
02:32:41,0 --> 02:32:41,0
had known this you

68
02:32:41,0 --> 02:32:41,0
could have

69
02:32:41,0 --> 02:32:41,0
translated;

70
02:32:41,0 --> 02:32:41,0
nevertheless, it is not

71
02:32:41,0 --> 02:32:41,0
expedient that you

72
02:32:41,0 --> 02:43:42,
should translate now.

73
02:43:42,0 --> 02:43:42,0
11 Behold, it

74
02:43:42,0 --> 02:43:42,0
was expedient when

75
02:43:42,0 --> 02:43:42,0
you commenced;

76
02:43:42,0 --> 02:43:42,0
but you feared,

77
02:43:42,0 --> 02:43:42,0
and the time is

78
02:43:42,0 --> 02:43:42,0
past, and it is

79
02:43:42,0 --> 02:47:21,
not expedient now;

80
02:47:21,0 --> 02:47:21,0
12 For, do you

81
02:47:21,0 --> 02:47:21,0
not behold

82
02:47:21,0 --> 02:47:21,0
that I have

83
02:47:21,0 --> 02:47:21,0
given unto my

84
02:47:21,0 --> 02:47:21,0
servant Joseph

85
02:47:21,0 --> 02:47:21,0
sufficient

86
02:47:21,0 --> 02:47:21,0
strength, whereby it

87
02:47:21,0 --> 02:47:21,0
is made up?

88
02:47:21,0 --> 02:47:21,0
And neither of

89
02:47:21,0 --> 03:00:25,
you have I condemned.

90
03:00:25,0 --> 03:00:25,0
13 Do this

91
03:00:25,0 --> 03:00:25,0
thing which I

92
03:00:25,0 --> 03:00:25,0
have commanded

93
03:00:25,0 --> 03:00:25,0
you, and you

94
03:00:25,0 --> 03:00:25,0
shall

95
03:00:25,0 --> 03:00:25,0
prosper. Be

96
03:00:25,0 --> 03:00:25,0
faithful, and yield

97
03:00:25,0 --> 03:35:23,
to no temptation.

98
03:35:23,0 --> 03:35:23,0
14 Stand

99
03:35:23,0 --> 03:35:23,0
fast in the

100
03:35:23,0 --> 03:35:23,0
work wherewith

101
03:35:23,0 --> 03:35:23,0
I have

102
03:35:23,0 --> 03:35:23,0
called you, and a

103
03:35:23,0 --> 03:35:23,0
hair of

104
03:35:23,0 --> 03:35:23,0
your head shall

105
03:35:23,0 --> 03:35:23,0
not be

106
03:35:23,0 --> 03:35:23,0
lost, and you

107
03:35:23,0 --> 03:35:23,0
shall be

108
03:35:23,0 --> 03:35:23,0
lifted up at the

109
03:35:23,0 --> 04:04:25,
last day. Amen.
