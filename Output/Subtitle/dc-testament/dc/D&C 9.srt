00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:26,382
Section 9 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:26,382 --> 00:00:31,493
 the Prophet to Oliver Cowdery, at Harmony,

3
00:00:31,493 --> 00:00:36,604
 Pennsylvania, April 1829. Oliver is admonished to be

4
00:00:36,604 --> 00:00:41,715
 patient and is urged to be content to write, for the

5
00:00:41,715 --> 00:00:46,826
 time being, at the dictation of the translator,

6
00:00:46,826 --> 00:00:51,937
 rather than to attempt to translate. 
1–6, Other

7
00:00:51,937 --> 00:00:57,048
 ancient records are yet to be translated; 
7–14, The

8
00:00:57,048 --> 00:01:02,159
 Book of Mormon is translated by study and by

9
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:07,27
 spiritual confirmation.

10
00:01:07,451 --> 00:01:13,618
1 Behold, I say unto you, my son, that because you

11
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:19,785
 did not translate according to that which you

12
00:01:19,785 --> 00:01:25,952
 desired of me, and did commence again to write for my

13
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:32,119
 servant, Joseph Smith, Jun., even so I would that

14
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:38,286
 ye should continue until you have finished this

15
00:01:38,286 --> 00:01:44,453
 record, which I have entrusted unto him

16
00:01:44,488 --> 00:01:49,155
2 And then, behold, other records have I, that I

17
00:01:49,155 --> 00:01:53,822
 will give unto you power that you may assist to

18
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:58,489
 translate

19
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:02,368
3 Be patient, my son, for it is wisdom in me, and

20
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:06,701
 it is not expedient that you should translate at

21
00:02:06,701 --> 00:02:11,034
 this present time

22
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:15,548
4 Behold, the work which you are called to do is

23
00:02:15,548 --> 00:02:19,548
 to write for my servant Joseph

24
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:24,273
5 And, behold, it is because that you did not

25
00:02:24,273 --> 00:02:28,94
 continue as you commenced, when you began to

26
00:02:28,94 --> 00:02:33,607
 translate, that I have taken away this privilege from you

27
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:41,187
6 Do not murmur, my son, for it is wisdom in me

28
00:02:41,187 --> 00:02:48,687
 that I have dealt with you after this manner

29
00:02:48,485 --> 00:02:53,152
7 Behold, you have not understood; you have

30
00:02:53,152 --> 00:02:57,819
 supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no

31
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:02,486
 thought save it was to ask me

32
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:09,082
8 But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study

33
00:03:09,082 --> 00:03:15,682
 it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it

34
00:03:15,682 --> 00:03:22,282
 be right, and if it is right I will cause that your

35
00:03:22,282 --> 00:03:28,882
 bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall

36
00:03:28,882 --> 00:03:35,482
 feel that it is right

37
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:41,816
9 But if it be not right you shall have no such

38
00:03:41,816 --> 00:03:47,816
 feelings, but you shall have a stupor of thought

39
00:03:47,816 --> 00:03:53,816
 that shall cause you to forget the thing which is

40
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:59,816
 wrong; therefore, you cannot write that which is

41
00:03:59,816 --> 00:04:05,816
 sacred save it be given you from me

42
00:04:05,562 --> 00:04:09,895
10 Now, if you had known this you could have

43
00:04:09,895 --> 00:04:14,228
 translated; nevertheless, it is not expedient that you

44
00:04:14,228 --> 00:04:18,561
 should translate now

45
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:24,509
11 Behold, it was expedient when you commenced;

46
00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:30,176
 but you feared, and the time is past, and it is not

47
00:04:30,176 --> 00:04:35,843
 expedient now

48
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:43,625
12 For, do you not behold that I have given unto

49
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:51,625
 my servant Joseph sufficient strength, whereby it

50
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:59,625
 is made up? And neither of you have I condemned

51
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:05,266
13 Do this thing which I have commanded you, and

52
00:05:05,266 --> 00:05:10,933
 you shall prosper. Be faithful, and yield to no

53
00:05:10,933 --> 00:05:16,6
 temptation

54
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:23,883
14 Stand fast in the work wherewith I have called

55
00:05:23,883 --> 00:05:30,883
 you, and a hair of your head shall not be lost,

56
00:05:30,883 --> 00:05:37,883
 and you shall be lifted up at the last day. Amen.
