00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:07,333
Section 9 Revelation given through Joseph

2
00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:14,666
Smith the Prophet to Oliver Cowdery, at Harmony,

3
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:21,999
Pennsylvania, April 1829. Oliver is admonished

4
00:00:21,999 --> 00:00:29,332
to be patient and is urged to be content to

5
00:00:29,332 --> 00:00:36,665
write, for the time being, at the dictation of

6
00:00:36,665 --> 00:00:43,998
the translator, rather than to attempt to

7
00:00:43,998 --> 00:00:51,331
translate. 
1–6, Other ancient records are yet to

8
00:00:51,331 --> 00:00:58,664
be translated; 
7–14, The Book of Mormon is

9
00:00:58,664 --> 00:01:06,967
translated by study and by spiritual confirmation. 

10
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:08,538
1 Behold, I say unto you, my son, that

11
00:01:08,538 --> 00:01:10,109
because you did not translate according to

12
00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:11,68
that which you desired of me, and did

13
00:01:11,68 --> 00:01:13,251
commence again to write for my servant,

14
00:01:13,251 --> 00:01:14,822
Joseph Smith, Jun., even so I would that ye

15
00:01:14,822 --> 00:01:16,393
should continue until you have finished

16
00:01:16,393 --> 00:01:17,978
this record, which I have entrusted unto him.

17
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:26,978
2 And then, behold, other records

18
00:01:26,978 --> 00:01:35,978
have I, that I will give unto you

19
00:01:35,978 --> 00:01:44,021
power that you may assist to translate.

20
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:47,271
3 Be patient, my son, for it

21
00:01:47,271 --> 00:01:50,521
is wisdom in me, and it is

22
00:01:50,521 --> 00:01:53,771
not expedient that you should

23
00:01:53,771 --> 00:01:57,1
translate at this present time.

24
00:01:57,1 --> 00:02:01,1
4 Behold, the work which

25
00:02:01,1 --> 00:02:05,1
you are called to do is to

26
00:02:05,1 --> 00:02:09,713
write for my servant Joseph.

27
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:11,213
5 And, behold, it is

28
00:02:11,213 --> 00:02:12,713
because that you did not

29
00:02:12,713 --> 00:02:14,213
continue as you commenced,

30
00:02:14,213 --> 00:02:15,713
when you began to

31
00:02:15,713 --> 00:02:17,213
translate, that I have taken

32
00:02:17,213 --> 00:02:18,772
away this privilege from you.

33
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:22,022
6 Do not murmur, my

34
00:02:22,022 --> 00:02:25,272
son, for it is wisdom in

35
00:02:25,272 --> 00:02:28,522
me that I have dealt

36
00:02:28,522 --> 00:02:31,852
with you after this manner.

37
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:31,185
7 Behold, you have

38
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:30,518
not understood; you

39
00:02:30,518 --> 00:02:29,851
have supposed that I

40
00:02:29,851 --> 00:02:29,184
would give it unto you,

41
00:02:29,184 --> 00:02:28,517
when you took no

42
00:02:28,517 --> 00:02:27,514
thought save it was to ask me.

43
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:27,878
8 But, behold, I say

44
00:02:27,878 --> 00:02:28,242
unto you, that you

45
00:02:28,242 --> 00:02:28,606
must study it out in

46
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:28,97
your mind; then you

47
00:02:28,97 --> 00:02:29,334
must ask me if it

48
00:02:29,334 --> 00:02:29,698
be right, and if it

49
00:02:29,698 --> 00:02:30,062
is right I will cause

50
00:02:30,062 --> 00:02:30,426
that your bosom

51
00:02:30,426 --> 00:02:30,79
shall burn within you;

52
00:02:30,79 --> 00:02:31,154
therefore, you shall

53
00:02:31,154 --> 00:02:31,635
feel that it is right.

54
00:02:31,635 --> 00:02:31,718
9 But if it be not

55
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:31,801
right you shall

56
00:02:31,801 --> 00:02:31,884
have no such feelings,

57
00:02:31,884 --> 00:02:31,967
but you shall have

58
00:02:31,967 --> 00:02:32,05
a stupor of

59
00:02:32,05 --> 00:02:32,133
thought that shall cause

60
00:02:32,133 --> 00:02:32,216
you to forget the

61
00:02:32,216 --> 00:02:32,299
thing which is

62
00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:32,382
wrong; therefore, you

63
00:02:32,382 --> 00:02:32,465
cannot write that

64
00:02:32,465 --> 00:02:32,548
which is sacred save

65
00:02:32,548 --> 00:02:32,703
it be given you from me.

66
00:02:32,703 --> 00:02:34,846
10 Now, if you

67
00:02:34,846 --> 00:02:36,989
had known this you

68
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:39,132
could have

69
00:02:39,132 --> 00:02:41,275
translated;

70
00:02:41,275 --> 00:02:43,418
nevertheless, it is not

71
00:02:43,418 --> 00:02:45,561
expedient that you

72
00:02:45,561 --> 00:02:47,751
should translate now.

73
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:48,751
11 Behold, it

74
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:49,751
was expedient when

75
00:02:49,751 --> 00:02:50,751
you commenced;

76
00:02:50,751 --> 00:02:51,751
but you feared,

77
00:02:51,751 --> 00:02:52,751
and the time is

78
00:02:52,751 --> 00:02:53,751
past, and it is

79
00:02:53,751 --> 00:02:54,808
not expedient now;

80
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:55,408
12 For, do you

81
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:56,008
not behold

82
00:02:56,008 --> 00:02:56,608
that I have

83
00:02:56,608 --> 00:02:57,208
given unto my

84
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:57,808
servant Joseph

85
00:02:57,808 --> 00:02:58,408
sufficient

86
00:02:58,408 --> 00:02:59,008
strength, whereby it

87
00:02:59,008 --> 00:02:59,608
is made up?

88
00:02:59,608 --> 00:03:00,208
And neither of

89
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:00,897
you have I condemned.

90
00:03:00,897 --> 00:03:05,147
13 Do this

91
00:03:05,147 --> 00:03:09,397
thing which I

92
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:13,647
have commanded

93
00:03:13,647 --> 00:03:17,897
you, and you

94
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:22,147
shall

95
00:03:22,147 --> 00:03:26,397
prosper. Be

96
00:03:26,397 --> 00:03:30,647
faithful, and yield

97
00:03:30,647 --> 00:03:34,931
to no temptation.

98
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:37,431
14 Stand

99
00:03:37,431 --> 00:03:39,931
fast in the

100
00:03:39,931 --> 00:03:42,431
work wherewith

101
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:44,931
I have

102
00:03:44,931 --> 00:03:47,431
called you, and a

103
00:03:47,431 --> 00:03:49,931
hair of

104
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:52,431
your head shall

105
00:03:52,431 --> 00:03:54,931
not be

106
00:03:54,931 --> 00:03:57,431
lost, and you

107
00:03:57,431 --> 00:03:59,931
shall be

108
00:03:59,931 --> 00:04:02,431
lifted up at the

109
00:04:02,431 --> 00:04:04,995
last day. Amen.
