00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:27,842
Section 9 Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet to 

2
00:00:27,842 --> 00:00:34,413
Oliver Cowdery, at Harmony, Pennsylvania, April 1829. Oliver is admonished 

3
00:00:34,413 --> 00:00:40,984
to be patient and is urged to be content to 

4
00:00:40,984 --> 00:00:47,555
write, for the time being, at the dictation of the 

5
00:00:47,555 --> 00:00:54,126
translator, rather than to attempt to translate. 
1–6, Other ancient 

6
00:00:54,126 --> 00:01:00,697
records are yet to be translated; 
7–14, The Book of 

7
00:01:00,697 --> 00:01:07,451
Mormon is translated by study and by spiritual confirmation.  

8
00:01:07,451 --> 00:01:13,618
1 Behold, I say unto you, my son, that because 

9
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:19,785
you did not translate according to that which you desired 

10
00:01:19,785 --> 00:01:25,952
of me, and did commence again to write for my 

11
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:32,119
servant, Joseph Smith, Jun., even so I would that ye 

12
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:38,286
should continue until you have finished this record, which I 

13
00:01:38,286 --> 00:01:44,488
have entrusted unto him. 

14
00:01:44,488 --> 00:01:49,155
2 And then, behold, other records have I, that I 

15
00:01:49,155 --> 00:01:53,822
will give unto you power that you may assist to 

16
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:58,035
translate. 

17
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:02,368
3 Be patient, my son, for it is wisdom in 

18
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:06,701
me, and it is not expedient that you should translate 

19
00:02:06,701 --> 00:02:11,548
at this present time. 

20
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:15,548
4 Behold, the work which you are called to do 

21
00:02:15,548 --> 00:02:19,606
is to write for my servant Joseph. 

22
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:24,273
5 And, behold, it is because that you did not 

23
00:02:24,273 --> 00:02:28,94
continue as you commenced, when you began to translate, that 

24
00:02:28,94 --> 00:02:33,687
I have taken away this privilege from you. 

25
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:38,687
6 Do not murmur, my son, for it is wisdom 

26
00:02:38,687 --> 00:02:43,687
in me that I have dealt with you after this 

27
00:02:43,687 --> 00:02:48,485
manner. 

28
00:02:48,485 --> 00:02:53,152
7 Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that 

29
00:02:53,152 --> 00:02:57,819
I would give it unto you, when you took no 

30
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:02,482
thought save it was to ask me. 

31
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:09,082
8 But, behold, I say unto you, that you must 

32
00:03:09,082 --> 00:03:15,682
study it out in your mind; then you must ask 

33
00:03:15,682 --> 00:03:22,282
me if it be right, and if it is right 

34
00:03:22,282 --> 00:03:28,882
I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; 

35
00:03:28,882 --> 00:03:35,816
therefore, you shall feel that it is right. 

36
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:41,816
9 But if it be not right you shall have 

37
00:03:41,816 --> 00:03:47,816
no such feelings, but you shall have a stupor of 

38
00:03:47,816 --> 00:03:53,816
thought that shall cause you to forget the thing which 

39
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:59,816
is wrong; therefore, you cannot write that which is sacred 

40
00:03:59,816 --> 00:04:05,562
save it be given you from me. 

41
00:04:05,562 --> 00:04:09,895
10 Now, if you had known this you could have 

42
00:04:09,895 --> 00:04:14,228
translated; nevertheless, it is not expedient that you should translate 

43
00:04:14,228 --> 00:04:18,842
now. 

44
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:24,509
11 Behold, it was expedient when you commenced; but you 

45
00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:30,176
feared, and the time is past, and it is not 

46
00:04:30,176 --> 00:04:35,625
expedient now; 

47
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:43,625
12 For, do you not behold that I have given 

48
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:51,625
unto my servant Joseph sufficient strength, whereby it is made 

49
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:59,599
up? And neither of you have I condemned. 

50
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:08,099
13 Do this thing which I have commanded you, and 

51
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:16,883
you shall prosper. Be faithful, and yield to no temptation. 

52
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:22,133
14 Stand fast in the work wherewith I have called 

53
00:05:22,133 --> 00:05:27,383
you, and a hair of your head shall not be 

54
00:05:27,383 --> 00:05:32,633
lost, and you shall be lifted up at the last 

55
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:37,654
day. Amen.
