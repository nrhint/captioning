00:00:21,505 --> 00:00:28,076
Section 9 Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet to 

2
00:00:28,076 --> 00:00:34,648
Oliver Cowdery, at Harmony, Pennsylvania, April 1829. Oliver is admonished 

3
00:00:34,648 --> 00:00:41,219
to be patient and is urged to be content to 

4
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:47,791
write, for the time being, at the dictation of the 

5
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:54,362
translator, rather than to attempt to translate. 
1–6, Other ancient 

6
00:00:54,362 --> 00:01:00,933
records are yet to be translated; 
7–14, The Book of 

7
00:01:00,933 --> 00:01:07,505
Mormon is translated by study and by spiritual confirmation.  

8
00:01:07,451 --> 00:01:13,617
1 Behold, I say unto you, my son, that because 

9
00:01:13,617 --> 00:01:19,784
you did not translate according to that which you desired 

10
00:01:19,784 --> 00:01:25,951
of me, and did commence again to write for my 

11
00:01:25,951 --> 00:01:32,117
servant, Joseph Smith, Jun., even so I would that ye 

12
00:01:32,117 --> 00:01:38,284
should continue until you have finished this record, which I 

13
00:01:38,284 --> 00:01:44,451
have entrusted unto him. 

14
00:01:44,488 --> 00:01:49,154
2 And then, behold, other records have I, that I 

15
00:01:49,154 --> 00:01:53,821
will give unto you power that you may assist to 

16
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:58,488
translate. 

17
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:02,368
3 Be patient, my son, for it is wisdom in 

18
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:06,701
me, and it is not expedient that you should translate 

19
00:02:06,701 --> 00:02:11,035
at this present time. 

20
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:15,548
4 Behold, the work which you are called to do 

21
00:02:15,548 --> 00:02:19,548
is to write for my servant Joseph. 

22
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:24,606
5 And, behold, it is because that you did not 

23
00:02:24,606 --> 00:02:29,606
continue as you commenced, when you began to translate, that 

24
00:02:29,606 --> 00:02:34,606
I have taken away this privilege from you. 

25
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:39,288
6 Do not murmur, my son, for it is wisdom 

26
00:02:39,288 --> 00:02:43,954
in me that I have dealt with you after this 

27
00:02:43,954 --> 00:02:48,621
manner. 

28
00:02:48,618 --> 00:02:53,618
7 Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that 

29
00:02:53,618 --> 00:02:58,618
I would give it unto you, when you took no 

30
00:02:58,618 --> 00:03:03,618
thought save it was to ask me. 

31
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:09,733
8 But, behold, I say unto you, that you must 

32
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:16,333
study it out in your mind; then you must ask 

33
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:22,933
me if it be right, and if it is right 

34
00:03:22,933 --> 00:03:29,533
I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; 

35
00:03:29,533 --> 00:03:36,133
therefore, you shall feel that it is right. 

36
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:41,983
9 But if it be not right you shall have 

37
00:03:41,983 --> 00:03:47,783
no such feelings, but you shall have a stupor of 

38
00:03:47,783 --> 00:03:53,583
thought that shall cause you to forget the thing which 

39
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:59,383
is wrong; therefore, you cannot write that which is sacred 

40
00:03:59,383 --> 00:04:05,183
save it be given you from me. 

41
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:10,345
10 Now, if you had known this you could have 

42
00:04:10,345 --> 00:04:15,012
translated; nevertheless, it is not expedient that you should translate 

43
00:04:15,012 --> 00:04:19,679
now. 

44
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:24,526
11 Behold, it was expedient when you commenced; but you 

45
00:04:24,526 --> 00:04:29,859
feared, and the time is past, and it is not 

46
00:04:29,859 --> 00:04:35,192
expedient now; 

47
00:04:35,725 --> 00:04:43,725
12 For, do you not behold that I have given 

48
00:04:43,725 --> 00:04:51,725
unto my servant Joseph sufficient strength, whereby it is made 

49
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:59,725
up? And neither of you have I condemned. 

50
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:08,199
13 Do this thing which I have commanded you, and 

51
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:16,699
you shall prosper. Be faithful, and yield to no temptation. 

52
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:23,466
14 Stand fast in the work wherewith I have called 

53
00:05:23,466 --> 00:05:30,216
you, and a hair of your head shall not be 

54
00:05:30,216 --> 00:05:36,966
lost, and you shall be lifted up at the last 

55
00:05:36,966 --> 00:05:43,716
day. Amen.
