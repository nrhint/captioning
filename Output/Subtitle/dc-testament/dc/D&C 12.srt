00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:05,385
Section 12 Revelation given through Joseph

2
00:00:05,385 --> 00:00:10,77
Smith the Prophet to Joseph Knight Sr., at Harmony,

3
00:00:10,77 --> 00:00:16,155
Pennsylvania, May 1829. Joseph Knight believed

4
00:00:16,155 --> 00:00:21,54
the declarations of Joseph Smith concerning

5
00:00:21,54 --> 00:00:26,925
his possession of the Book of Mormon plates and

6
00:00:26,925 --> 00:00:32,31
the work of translation then in progress and

7
00:00:32,31 --> 00:00:37,695
several times had given material assistance to

8
00:00:37,695 --> 00:00:43,08
Joseph Smith and his scribe, which enabled them to

9
00:00:43,08 --> 00:00:48,465
continue translating. At Joseph Knight’s

10
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:53,85
request, the Prophet inquired of the Lord and

11
00:00:53,85 --> 00:00:59,235
received the revelation. 
1–6, Laborers in the

12
00:00:59,235 --> 00:01:04,62
vineyard are to gain salvation; 
7–9, All who desire

13
00:01:04,62 --> 00:01:10,103
and are qualified may assist in the Lord’s work. 

14
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:20,103
1 A great and marvelous work is about

15
00:01:20,103 --> 00:01:30,457
to come forth among the children of men.

16
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:32,857
2 Behold, I am God; give heed to my

17
00:01:32,857 --> 00:01:35,257
word, which is quick and powerful,

18
00:01:35,257 --> 00:01:37,657
sharper than a two-edged sword, to the

19
00:01:37,657 --> 00:01:40,057
dividing asunder of both joints and

20
00:01:40,057 --> 00:01:42,836
marrow; therefore, give heed unto my word.

21
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:44,122
3 Behold, the field is white

22
00:01:44,122 --> 00:01:45,408
already to harvest; therefore, whoso

23
00:01:45,408 --> 00:01:46,694
desireth to reap let him thrust in

24
00:01:46,694 --> 00:01:47,98
his sickle with his might, and reap

25
00:01:47,98 --> 00:01:49,266
while the day lasts, that he may

26
00:01:49,266 --> 00:01:50,552
treasure up for his soul

27
00:01:50,552 --> 00:01:51,278
everlasting salvation in the kingdom of God.

28
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:59,278
4 Yea, whosoever will

29
00:01:59,278 --> 00:02:07,278
thrust in his sickle and reap,

30
00:02:07,278 --> 00:02:15,202
the same is called of God.

31
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:23,702
5 Therefore, if you will

32
00:02:23,702 --> 00:02:32,202
ask of me you shall

33
00:02:32,202 --> 00:02:40,702
receive; if you will knock it

34
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:49,503
shall be opened unto you.

35
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,17
6 Now, as you have

36
00:02:51,17 --> 00:02:52,837
asked, behold, I say

37
00:02:52,837 --> 00:02:54,504
unto you, keep my

38
00:02:54,504 --> 00:02:56,171
commandments, and seek to

39
00:02:56,171 --> 00:02:57,838
bring forth and

40
00:02:57,838 --> 00:02:59,88
establish the cause of Zion.

41
00:02:59,88 --> 00:03:01,547
7 Behold, I speak

42
00:03:01,547 --> 00:03:03,214
unto you, and

43
00:03:03,214 --> 00:03:04,881
also to all those

44
00:03:04,881 --> 00:03:06,548
who have desires

45
00:03:06,548 --> 00:03:08,215
to bring forth and

46
00:03:08,215 --> 00:03:09,322
establish this work;

47
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:09,686
8 And no one can

48
00:03:09,686 --> 00:03:10,05
assist in this

49
00:03:10,05 --> 00:03:10,414
work except he

50
00:03:10,414 --> 00:03:10,778
shall be humble and

51
00:03:10,778 --> 00:03:11,142
full of love,

52
00:03:11,142 --> 00:03:11,506
having faith, hope,

53
00:03:11,506 --> 00:03:11,87
and charity, being

54
00:03:11,87 --> 00:03:12,234
temperate in all

55
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:12,598
things,

56
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:12,962
whatsoever shall be

57
00:03:12,962 --> 00:03:13,727
entrusted to his care.

58
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:15,616
9 Behold, I am

59
00:03:15,616 --> 00:03:17,505
the light and the

60
00:03:17,505 --> 00:03:19,394
life of the

61
00:03:19,394 --> 00:03:21,283
world, that speak

62
00:03:21,283 --> 00:03:23,172
these words,

63
00:03:23,172 --> 00:03:25,061
therefore give heed

64
00:03:25,061 --> 00:03:26,95
with your might,

65
00:03:26,95 --> 00:03:28,839
and then you

66
00:03:28,839 --> 00:03:30,143
are called. Amen.
