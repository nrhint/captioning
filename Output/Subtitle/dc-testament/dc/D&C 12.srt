00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 12 Revelation given through Joseph

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Smith the Prophet to Joseph Knight Sr., at Harmony,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Pennsylvania, May 1829. Joseph Knight believed

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the declarations of Joseph Smith concerning

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
his possession of the Book of Mormon plates and

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the work of translation then in progress and

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
several times had given material assistance to

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Joseph Smith and his scribe, which enabled them to

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
continue translating. At Joseph Knight’s

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
request, the Prophet inquired of the Lord and

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
received the revelation. 
1–6, Laborers in the

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
vineyard are to gain salvation; 
7–9, All who desire

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:35:01,
and are qualified may assist in the Lord’s work. 

14
00:35:01,0 --> 00:35:01,0
1 A great and marvelous work is about

15
00:35:01,0 --> 00:45:41,
to come forth among the children of men.

16
00:45:41,0 --> 00:45:41,0
2 Behold, I am God; give heed to my

17
00:45:41,0 --> 00:45:41,0
word, which is quick and powerful,

18
00:45:41,0 --> 00:45:41,0
sharper than a two-edged sword, to the

19
00:45:41,0 --> 00:45:41,0
dividing asunder of both joints and

20
00:45:41,0 --> 00:50:52,
marrow; therefore, give heed unto my word.

21
00:50:52,0 --> 00:50:52,0
3 Behold, the field is white

22
00:50:52,0 --> 00:50:52,0
already to harvest; therefore, whoso

23
00:50:52,0 --> 00:50:52,0
desireth to reap let him thrust in

24
00:50:52,0 --> 00:50:52,0
his sickle with his might, and reap

25
00:50:52,0 --> 00:50:52,0
while the day lasts, that he may

26
00:50:52,0 --> 00:50:52,0
treasure up for his soul

27
00:50:52,0 --> 01:07:32,
everlasting salvation in the kingdom of God.

28
01:07:32,0 --> 01:07:32,0
4 Yea, whosoever will

29
01:07:32,0 --> 01:07:32,0
thrust in his sickle and reap,

30
01:07:32,0 --> 01:24:40,
the same is called of God.

31
01:24:40,0 --> 01:24:40,0
5 Therefore, if you will

32
01:24:40,0 --> 01:24:40,0
ask of me you shall

33
01:24:40,0 --> 01:24:40,0
receive; if you will knock it

34
01:24:40,0 --> 01:29:51,
shall be opened unto you.

35
01:29:51,0 --> 01:29:51,0
6 Now, as you have

36
01:29:51,0 --> 01:29:51,0
asked, behold, I say

37
01:29:51,0 --> 01:29:51,0
unto you, keep my

38
01:29:51,0 --> 01:29:51,0
commandments, and seek to

39
01:29:51,0 --> 01:29:51,0
bring forth and

40
01:29:51,0 --> 01:34:34,
establish the cause of Zion.

41
01:34:34,0 --> 01:34:34,0
7 Behold, I speak

42
01:34:34,0 --> 01:34:34,0
unto you, and

43
01:34:34,0 --> 01:34:34,0
also to all those

44
01:34:34,0 --> 01:34:34,0
who have desires

45
01:34:34,0 --> 01:34:34,0
to bring forth and

46
01:34:34,0 --> 01:44:44,
establish this work;

47
01:44:44,0 --> 01:44:44,0
8 And no one can

48
01:44:44,0 --> 01:44:44,0
assist in this

49
01:44:44,0 --> 01:44:44,0
work except he

50
01:44:44,0 --> 01:44:44,0
shall be humble and

51
01:44:44,0 --> 01:44:44,0
full of love,

52
01:44:44,0 --> 01:44:44,0
having faith, hope,

53
01:44:44,0 --> 01:44:44,0
and charity, being

54
01:44:44,0 --> 01:44:44,0
temperate in all

55
01:44:44,0 --> 01:44:44,0
things,

56
01:44:44,0 --> 01:44:44,0
whatsoever shall be

57
01:44:44,0 --> 01:52:28,
entrusted to his care.

58
01:52:28,0 --> 01:52:28,0
9 Behold, I am

59
01:52:28,0 --> 01:52:28,0
the light and the

60
01:52:28,0 --> 01:52:28,0
life of the

61
01:52:28,0 --> 01:52:28,0
world, that speak

62
01:52:28,0 --> 01:52:28,0
these words,

63
01:52:28,0 --> 01:52:28,0
therefore give heed

64
01:52:28,0 --> 01:52:28,0
with your might,

65
01:52:28,0 --> 01:52:28,0
and then you

66
01:52:28,0 --> 02:02:38,
are called. Amen.
