00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:17,666
Section 12 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:23,819
 the Prophet to Joseph Knight Sr., at Harmony,

3
00:00:23,819 --> 00:00:29,974
 Pennsylvania, May 1829. Joseph Knight believed the

4
00:00:29,974 --> 00:00:36,127
 declarations of Joseph Smith concerning his possession

5
00:00:36,127 --> 00:00:42,282
 of the Book of Mormon plates and the work of

6
00:00:42,282 --> 00:00:48,435
 translation then in progress and several times had

7
00:00:48,435 --> 00:00:54,59
 given material assistance to Joseph Smith and his

8
00:00:54,59 --> 00:01:00,743
 scribe, which enabled them to continue translating.

9
00:01:00,743 --> 00:01:06,897
 At Joseph Knight’s request, the Prophet inquired of

10
00:01:06,897 --> 00:01:13,052
 the Lord and received the revelation. 
1–6,

11
00:01:13,052 --> 00:01:19,206
 Laborers in the vineyard are to gain salvation; 
7–9,

12
00:01:19,206 --> 00:01:25,359
 All who desire and are qualified may assist in the

13
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:31,513
 Lord’s work.

14
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:37,892
1 A great and marvelous work is about to come

15
00:01:37,892 --> 00:01:43,892
 forth among the children of men

16
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:51,637
2 Behold, I am God; give heed to my word, which is

17
00:01:51,637 --> 00:01:59,637
 quick and powerful, sharper than a two-edged

18
00:01:59,637 --> 00:02:07,637
 sword, to the dividing asunder of both joints and

19
00:02:07,637 --> 00:02:15,637
 marrow; therefore, give heed unto my word

20
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:22,636
3 Behold, the field is white already to harvest;

21
00:02:22,636 --> 00:02:29,636
 therefore, whoso desireth to reap let him thrust in

22
00:02:29,636 --> 00:02:36,636
 his sickle with his might, and reap while the day

23
00:02:36,636 --> 00:02:43,636
 lasts, that he may treasure up for his soul

24
00:02:43,636 --> 00:02:50,636
 everlasting salvation in the kingdom of God

25
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:55,103
4 Yea, whosoever will thrust in his sickle and

26
00:02:55,103 --> 00:03:00,103
 reap, the same is called of God

27
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:04,647
5 Therefore, if you will ask of me you shall

28
00:03:04,647 --> 00:03:08,647
 receive; if you will knock it shall be opened unto you

29
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:12,647


30
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:18,626
6 Now, as you have asked, behold, I say unto you,

31
00:03:18,626 --> 00:03:24,626
 keep my commandments, and seek to bring forth and

32
00:03:24,626 --> 00:03:30,626
 establish the cause of Zion

33
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:35,944
7 Behold, I speak unto you, and also to all those

34
00:03:35,944 --> 00:03:40,944
 who have desires to bring forth and establish this

35
00:03:40,944 --> 00:03:45,944
 work

36
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:51,176
8 And no one can assist in this work except he

37
00:03:51,176 --> 00:03:56,426
 shall be humble and full of love, having faith, hope,

38
00:03:56,426 --> 00:04:01,676
 and charity, being temperate in all things,

39
00:04:01,676 --> 00:04:06,926
 whatsoever shall be entrusted to his care

40
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:13,246
9 Behold, I am the light and the life of the

41
00:04:13,246 --> 00:04:19,579
 world, that speak these words, therefore give heed with

42
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:25,912
 your might, and then you are called. Amen.
