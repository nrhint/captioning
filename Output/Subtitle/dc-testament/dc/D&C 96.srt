00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:18,349
Section 96 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:18,349 --> 00:00:25,42
 Prophet, showing the order of the city or stake of

3
00:00:25,42 --> 00:00:32,491
 Zion at Kirtland, Ohio, June 4, 1833, as an example

4
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:39,562
 to the Saints in Kirtland. The occasion was a

5
00:00:39,562 --> 00:00:46,633
 conference of high priests, and the chief subject of

6
00:00:46,633 --> 00:00:53,704
 consideration was the disposal of certain lands,

7
00:00:53,704 --> 00:01:00,775
 known as the French farm, possessed by the Church

8
00:01:00,775 --> 00:01:07,846
 near Kirtland. Since the conference could not agree

9
00:01:07,846 --> 00:01:14,917
 who should take charge of the farm, all agreed to

10
00:01:14,917 --> 00:01:21,988
 inquire of the Lord concerning the matter. 
1,

11
00:01:21,988 --> 00:01:29,059
 The Kirtland Stake of Zion is to be made strong;

12
00:01:29,059 --> 00:01:36,13
2–5, The bishop is to divide the inheritances for

13
00:01:36,13 --> 00:01:43,201
 the Saints; 
6–9, John Johnson is to be a member of

14
00:01:43,201 --> 00:01:50,272
 the united order.

15
00:01:50,894 --> 00:01:55,694
1 Behold, I say unto you, here is wisdom, whereby

16
00:01:55,694 --> 00:02:00,494
 ye may know how to act concerning this matter, for

17
00:02:00,494 --> 00:02:05,294
 it is expedient in me that this stake that I have

18
00:02:05,294 --> 00:02:10,094
 set for the strength of Zion should be made

19
00:02:10,094 --> 00:02:14,894
 strong

20
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:20,051
2 Therefore, let my servant Newel K. Whitney take

21
00:02:20,051 --> 00:02:25,718
 charge of the place which is named among you, upon

22
00:02:25,718 --> 00:02:31,385
 which I design to build mine holy house

23
00:02:31,668 --> 00:02:35,668
3 And again, let it be divided into lots,

24
00:02:35,668 --> 00:02:39,668
 according to wisdom, for the benefit of those who seek

25
00:02:39,668 --> 00:02:43,668
 inheritances, as it shall be determined in council

26
00:02:43,668 --> 00:02:47,668
 among you

27
00:02:47,651 --> 00:02:51,651
4 Therefore, take heed that ye see to this matter,

28
00:02:51,651 --> 00:02:55,651
 and that portion that is necessary to benefit

29
00:02:55,651 --> 00:02:59,651
 mine order, for the purpose of bringing forth my word

30
00:02:59,651 --> 00:03:03,651
 to the children of men

31
00:03:03,633 --> 00:03:08,233
5 For behold, verily I say unto you, this is the

32
00:03:08,233 --> 00:03:12,833
 most expedient in me, that my word should go forth

33
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:17,433
 unto the children of men, for the purpose of

34
00:03:17,433 --> 00:03:22,033
 subduing the hearts of the children of men for your

35
00:03:22,033 --> 00:03:26,633
 good. Even so. Amen

36
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:31,29
6 And again, verily I say unto you, it is wisdom

37
00:03:31,29 --> 00:03:35,957
 and expedient in me, that my servant John Johnson

38
00:03:35,957 --> 00:03:40,624
 whose offering I have accepted, and whose prayers I

39
00:03:40,624 --> 00:03:45,291
 have heard, unto whom I give a promise of eternal

40
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:49,958
 life inasmuch as he keepeth my commandments from

41
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:54,625
 henceforth

42
00:03:54,918 --> 00:03:59,585
7 For he is a descendant of Joseph and a partaker

43
00:03:59,585 --> 00:04:04,252
 of the blessings of the promise made unto his

44
00:04:04,252 --> 00:04:08,919
 fathers

45
00:04:08,432 --> 00:04:11,682
8 Verily I say unto you, it is expedient in me

46
00:04:11,682 --> 00:04:14,932
 that he should become a member of the order, that he

47
00:04:14,932 --> 00:04:18,182
 may assist in bringing forth my word unto the

48
00:04:18,182 --> 00:04:21,432
 children of men

49
00:04:21,211 --> 00:04:26,461
9 Therefore ye shall ordain him unto this

50
00:04:26,461 --> 00:04:31,711
 blessing, and he shall seek diligently to take away

51
00:04:31,711 --> 00:04:36,961
 incumbrances that are upon the house named among you,

52
00:04:36,961 --> 00:04:42,211
 that he may dwell therein. Even so. Amen.
