00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 96 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Prophet, showing the order of the city or

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
stake of Zion at Kirtland, Ohio, June 4, 1833, as

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
an example to the Saints in Kirtland. The

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
occasion was a conference of high priests, and the

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
chief subject of consideration was the disposal

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of certain lands, known as the French farm,

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
possessed by the Church near Kirtland. Since the

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
conference could not agree who should take charge

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of the farm, all agreed to inquire of the Lord

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
concerning the matter. 
1, The Kirtland Stake

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of Zion is to be made strong; 
2–5, The bishop

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
is to divide the inheritances for the Saints;

14
00:00:00,0 --> 01:49:52,
6–9, John Johnson is to be a member of the united order. 

15
01:49:52,0 --> 01:49:52,0
1 Behold, I say unto you, here is

16
01:49:52,0 --> 01:49:52,0
wisdom, whereby ye may know how to act

17
01:49:52,0 --> 01:49:52,0
concerning this matter, for it is expedient in

18
01:49:52,0 --> 01:49:52,0
me that this stake that I have set for

19
01:49:52,0 --> 01:56:54,
the strength of Zion should be made strong.

20
01:56:54,0 --> 01:56:54,0
2 Therefore, let my servant

21
01:56:54,0 --> 01:56:54,0
Newel K. Whitney take charge of the place

22
01:56:54,0 --> 01:56:54,0
which is named among you, upon

23
01:56:54,0 --> 01:59:56,
which I design to build mine holy house.

24
01:59:56,0 --> 01:59:56,0
3 And again, let it be divided

25
01:59:56,0 --> 01:59:56,0
into lots, according to wisdom,

26
01:59:56,0 --> 01:59:56,0
for the benefit of those who

27
01:59:56,0 --> 01:59:56,0
seek inheritances, as it shall

28
01:59:56,0 --> 02:04:33,
be determined in council among you.

29
02:04:33,0 --> 02:04:33,0
4 Therefore, take heed that

30
02:04:33,0 --> 02:04:33,0
ye see to this matter, and

31
02:04:33,0 --> 02:04:33,0
that portion that is necessary

32
02:04:33,0 --> 02:04:33,0
to benefit mine order, for the

33
02:04:33,0 --> 02:04:33,0
purpose of bringing forth my

34
02:04:33,0 --> 02:13:36,
word to the children of men.

35
02:13:36,0 --> 02:13:36,0
5 For behold, verily I say

36
02:13:36,0 --> 02:13:36,0
unto you, this is the most

37
02:13:36,0 --> 02:13:36,0
expedient in me, that my

38
02:13:36,0 --> 02:13:36,0
word should go forth unto the

39
02:13:36,0 --> 02:13:36,0
children of men, for the

40
02:13:36,0 --> 02:13:36,0
purpose of subduing the

41
02:13:36,0 --> 02:13:36,0
hearts of the children of men

42
02:13:36,0 --> 02:25:14,
for your good. Even so. Amen.

43
02:25:14,0 --> 02:25:14,0
6 And again, verily I say

44
02:25:14,0 --> 02:25:14,0
unto you, it is wisdom and

45
02:25:14,0 --> 02:25:14,0
expedient in me, that my

46
02:25:14,0 --> 02:25:14,0
servant John Johnson whose

47
02:25:14,0 --> 02:25:14,0
offering I have accepted,

48
02:25:14,0 --> 02:25:14,0
and whose prayers I have

49
02:25:14,0 --> 02:25:14,0
heard, unto whom I give a

50
02:25:14,0 --> 02:25:14,0
promise of eternal life

51
02:25:14,0 --> 02:25:14,0
inasmuch as he keepeth my

52
02:25:14,0 --> 02:30:19,
commandments from henceforth—

53
02:30:19,0 --> 02:30:19,0
7 For he is a descendant

54
02:30:19,0 --> 02:30:19,0
of Joseph and a partaker of

55
02:30:19,0 --> 02:30:19,0
the blessings of the

56
02:30:19,0 --> 02:45:21,
promise made unto his fathers—

57
02:45:21,0 --> 02:45:21,0
8 Verily I say unto

58
02:45:21,0 --> 02:45:21,0
you, it is expedient in me

59
02:45:21,0 --> 02:45:21,0
that he should become

60
02:45:21,0 --> 02:45:21,0
a member of the order,

61
02:45:21,0 --> 02:45:21,0
that he may assist in

62
02:45:21,0 --> 02:45:21,0
bringing forth my word

63
02:45:21,0 --> 02:43:27,
unto the children of men.

64
02:43:27,0 --> 02:43:27,0
9 Therefore ye shall

65
02:43:27,0 --> 02:43:27,0
ordain him unto this

66
02:43:27,0 --> 02:43:27,0
blessing, and he

67
02:43:27,0 --> 02:43:27,0
shall seek diligently to

68
02:43:27,0 --> 02:43:27,0
take away

69
02:43:27,0 --> 02:43:27,0
incumbrances that are upon the

70
02:43:27,0 --> 02:43:27,0
house named among you,

71
02:43:27,0 --> 02:43:27,0
that he may dwell

72
02:43:27,0 --> 02:47:06,
therein. Even so. Amen.
