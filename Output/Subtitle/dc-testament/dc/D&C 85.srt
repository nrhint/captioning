00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 85 Revelation given through Joseph

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, November

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
27, 1832. This section is an extract from a

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
letter of the Prophet to William W. Phelps, who

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
was living in Independence, Missouri. It answers

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
questions about those Saints who had moved to

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Zion but who had not followed the commandment

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
to consecrate their properties and had thus

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
not received their inheritances according to

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the established order in the Church. 
1–5,

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Inheritances in Zion are to be received through

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
consecration; 
6–12, One mighty and strong will

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
give the Saints their inheritance in Zion.

14
00:00:00,0 --> 01:34:52,
second chapter and sixty-first and second verses of Ezra. 

15
01:34:52,0 --> 01:34:52,0
1 It is the duty of the Lord’s clerk,

16
01:34:52,0 --> 01:34:52,0
whom he has appointed, to keep a

17
01:34:52,0 --> 01:34:52,0
history, and a general church record of all

18
01:34:52,0 --> 01:34:52,0
things that transpire in Zion, and of all

19
01:34:52,0 --> 01:34:52,0
those who consecrate properties, and

20
01:34:52,0 --> 01:35:56,
receive inheritances legally from the bishop;

21
01:35:56,0 --> 01:35:56,0
2 And also their manner of life,

22
01:35:56,0 --> 01:35:56,0
their faith, and works; and also

23
01:35:56,0 --> 01:35:56,0
of the apostates who apostatize

24
01:35:56,0 --> 01:35:34,
after receiving their inheritances.

25
01:35:34,0 --> 01:35:34,0
3 It is contrary to the will

26
01:35:34,0 --> 01:35:34,0
and commandment of God that

27
01:35:34,0 --> 01:35:34,0
those who receive not their

28
01:35:34,0 --> 01:35:34,0
inheritance by consecration,

29
01:35:34,0 --> 01:35:34,0
agreeable to his law, which he has

30
01:35:34,0 --> 01:35:34,0
given, that he may tithe his

31
01:35:34,0 --> 01:35:34,0
people, to prepare them against

32
01:35:34,0 --> 01:35:34,0
the day of vengeance and

33
01:35:34,0 --> 01:35:34,0
burning, should have their names

34
01:35:34,0 --> 01:31:14,
enrolled with the people of God.

35
01:31:14,0 --> 01:31:14,0
4 Neither is their

36
01:31:14,0 --> 01:31:14,0
genealogy to be kept, or to

37
01:31:14,0 --> 01:31:14,0
be had where it may be

38
01:31:14,0 --> 01:31:14,0
found on any of the

39
01:31:14,0 --> 01:36:19,
records or history of the church.

40
01:36:19,0 --> 01:36:19,0
5 Their names shall not

41
01:36:19,0 --> 01:36:19,0
be found, neither the

42
01:36:19,0 --> 01:36:19,0
names of the fathers,

43
01:36:19,0 --> 01:36:19,0
nor the names of the

44
01:36:19,0 --> 01:36:19,0
children written in the

45
01:36:19,0 --> 01:36:19,0
book of the law of God,

46
01:36:19,0 --> 01:35:57,
saith the Lord of Hosts.

47
01:35:57,0 --> 01:35:57,0
6 Yea, thus saith the

48
01:35:57,0 --> 01:35:57,0
still small voice,

49
01:35:57,0 --> 01:35:57,0
which whispereth

50
01:35:57,0 --> 01:35:57,0
through and pierceth all

51
01:35:57,0 --> 01:35:57,0
things, and often

52
01:35:57,0 --> 01:35:57,0
times it maketh my bones

53
01:35:57,0 --> 01:35:57,0
to quake while it

54
01:35:57,0 --> 01:35:35,
maketh manifest, saying:

55
01:35:35,0 --> 01:35:35,0
7 And it shall come

56
01:35:35,0 --> 01:35:35,0
to pass that I, the

57
01:35:35,0 --> 01:35:35,0
Lord God, will send

58
01:35:35,0 --> 01:35:35,0
one mighty and

59
01:35:35,0 --> 01:35:35,0
strong, holding the

60
01:35:35,0 --> 01:35:35,0
scepter of power in his

61
01:35:35,0 --> 01:35:35,0
hand, clothed with

62
01:35:35,0 --> 01:35:35,0
light for a covering,

63
01:35:35,0 --> 01:35:35,0
whose mouth shall

64
01:35:35,0 --> 01:35:35,0
utter words, eternal

65
01:35:35,0 --> 01:35:35,0
words; while his

66
01:35:35,0 --> 01:35:35,0
bowels shall be a

67
01:35:35,0 --> 01:35:35,0
fountain of truth, to set

68
01:35:35,0 --> 01:35:35,0
in order the house

69
01:35:35,0 --> 01:35:35,0
of God, and to

70
01:35:35,0 --> 01:35:35,0
arrange by lot the

71
01:35:35,0 --> 01:35:35,0
inheritances of the saints

72
01:35:35,0 --> 01:35:35,0
whose names are

73
01:35:35,0 --> 01:35:35,0
found, and the names of

74
01:35:35,0 --> 01:35:35,0
their fathers, and

75
01:35:35,0 --> 01:35:35,0
of their children,

76
01:35:35,0 --> 01:31:15,
enrolled in the book of the law of God;

77
01:31:15,0 --> 01:31:15,0
8 While that man,

78
01:31:15,0 --> 01:31:15,0
who was called of

79
01:31:15,0 --> 01:31:15,0
God and appointed,

80
01:31:15,0 --> 01:31:15,0
that putteth

81
01:31:15,0 --> 01:31:15,0
forth his hand to

82
01:31:15,0 --> 01:31:15,0
steady the ark of God,

83
01:31:15,0 --> 01:31:15,0
shall fall by the

84
01:31:15,0 --> 01:31:15,0
shaft of death,

85
01:31:15,0 --> 01:31:15,0
like as a tree that

86
01:31:15,0 --> 01:31:15,0
is smitten by the

87
01:31:15,0 --> 01:36:20,
vivid shaft of lightning.

88
01:36:20,0 --> 01:36:20,0
9 And all they

89
01:36:20,0 --> 01:36:20,0
who are not found

90
01:36:20,0 --> 01:36:20,0
written in the

91
01:36:20,0 --> 01:36:20,0
book of remembrance

92
01:36:20,0 --> 01:36:20,0
shall find none

93
01:36:20,0 --> 01:36:20,0
inheritance in

94
01:36:20,0 --> 01:36:20,0
that day, but they

95
01:36:20,0 --> 01:36:20,0
shall be cut

96
01:36:20,0 --> 01:36:20,0
asunder, and their

97
01:36:20,0 --> 01:36:20,0
portion shall be

98
01:36:20,0 --> 01:36:20,0
appointed them among

99
01:36:20,0 --> 01:36:20,0
unbelievers,

100
01:36:20,0 --> 01:36:20,0
where are wailing

101
01:36:20,0 --> 02:10:20,
and gnashing of teeth.

102
02:10:20,0 --> 02:10:20,0
10 These things

103
02:10:20,0 --> 02:10:20,0
I say not of

104
02:10:20,0 --> 02:10:20,0
myself;

105
02:10:20,0 --> 02:10:20,0
therefore, as the Lord

106
02:10:20,0 --> 02:10:20,0
speaketh, he

107
02:10:20,0 --> 02:06:28,
will also fulfil.

108
02:06:28,0 --> 02:06:28,0
11 And they

109
02:06:28,0 --> 02:06:28,0
who are of the

110
02:06:28,0 --> 02:06:28,0
High

111
02:06:28,0 --> 02:06:28,0
Priesthood, whose names

112
02:06:28,0 --> 02:06:28,0
are not found

113
02:06:28,0 --> 02:06:28,0
written in the

114
02:06:28,0 --> 02:06:28,0
book of the

115
02:06:28,0 --> 02:06:28,0
law, or that

116
02:06:28,0 --> 02:06:28,0
are found to

117
02:06:28,0 --> 02:06:28,0
have apostatized,

118
02:06:28,0 --> 02:06:28,0
or to have

119
02:06:28,0 --> 02:06:28,0
been cut off

120
02:06:28,0 --> 02:06:28,0
from the church,

121
02:06:28,0 --> 02:06:28,0
as well as the

122
02:06:28,0 --> 02:06:28,0
lesser

123
02:06:28,0 --> 02:06:28,0
priesthood, or the

124
02:06:28,0 --> 02:06:28,0
members, in

125
02:06:28,0 --> 02:06:28,0
that day shall

126
02:06:28,0 --> 02:06:28,0
not find an

127
02:06:28,0 --> 02:06:28,0
inheritance among

128
02:06:28,0 --> 02:11:33,
the saints of the Most High;

129
02:11:33,0 --> 02:11:33,0
12 Therefore,

130
02:11:33,0 --> 02:11:33,0
it shall be

131
02:11:33,0 --> 02:11:33,0
done unto

132
02:11:33,0 --> 02:11:33,0
them as unto the

133
02:11:33,0 --> 02:11:33,0
children of

134
02:11:33,0 --> 02:11:33,0
the priest,

135
02:11:33,0 --> 02:11:33,0
as will be

136
02:11:33,0 --> 02:21:35,
found recorded in the
