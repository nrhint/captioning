00:00:10,01 --> 00:00:16,224
Section 85 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:22,438
 the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, November 27, 1832.

3
00:00:22,438 --> 00:00:28,652
 This section is an extract from a letter of the

4
00:00:28,652 --> 00:00:34,866
 Prophet to William W. Phelps, who was living in

5
00:00:34,866 --> 00:00:41,08
 Independence, Missouri. It answers questions about

6
00:00:41,08 --> 00:00:47,294
 those Saints who had moved to Zion but who had not

7
00:00:47,294 --> 00:00:53,508
 followed the commandment to consecrate their

8
00:00:53,508 --> 00:00:59,722
 properties and had thus not received their inheritances

9
00:00:59,722 --> 00:01:05,936
 according to the established order in the Church.

10
00:01:05,936 --> 00:01:12,15
1–5, Inheritances in Zion are to be received

11
00:01:12,15 --> 00:01:18,364
 through consecration; 
6–12, One mighty and strong will

12
00:01:18,364 --> 00:01:24,578
 give the Saints their inheritance in Zion.

13
00:01:24,578 --> 00:01:30,792
second chapter and sixty-first and second verses of

14
00:01:30,792 --> 00:01:37,006
 Ezra.

15
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:44,431
1 It is the duty of the Lord’s clerk, whom he has

16
00:01:44,431 --> 00:01:51,431
 appointed, to keep a history, and a general church

17
00:01:51,431 --> 00:01:58,431
 record of all things that transpire in Zion, and

18
00:01:58,431 --> 00:02:05,431
 of all those who consecrate properties, and

19
00:02:05,431 --> 00:02:12,431
 receive inheritances legally from the bishop

20
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:18,583
2 And also their manner of life, their faith, and

21
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:24,25
 works; and also of the apostates who apostatize

22
00:02:24,25 --> 00:02:29,917
 after receiving their inheritances

23
00:02:29,933 --> 00:02:34,79
3 It is contrary to the will and commandment of

24
00:02:34,79 --> 00:02:39,647
 God that those who receive not their inheritance by

25
00:02:39,647 --> 00:02:44,504
 consecration, agreeable to his law, which he has

26
00:02:44,504 --> 00:02:49,361
 given, that he may tithe his people, to prepare

27
00:02:49,361 --> 00:02:54,218
 them against the day of vengeance and burning, should

28
00:02:54,218 --> 00:02:59,075
 have their names enrolled with the people of God

29
00:02:59,075 --> 00:03:03,932


30
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:08,684
4 Neither is their genealogy to be kept, or to be

31
00:03:08,684 --> 00:03:13,684
 had where it may be found on any of the records or

32
00:03:13,684 --> 00:03:18,684
 history of the church

33
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:23,448
5 Their names shall not be found, neither the

34
00:03:23,448 --> 00:03:28,698
 names of the fathers, nor the names of the children

35
00:03:28,698 --> 00:03:33,948
 written in the book of the law of God, saith the

36
00:03:33,948 --> 00:03:39,198
 Lord of Hosts

37
00:03:39,202 --> 00:03:44,202
6 Yea, thus saith the still small voice, which

38
00:03:44,202 --> 00:03:49,202
 whispereth through and pierceth all things, and often

39
00:03:49,202 --> 00:03:54,202
 times it maketh my bones to quake while it maketh

40
00:03:54,202 --> 00:03:59,202
 manifest, saying

41
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:05,206
7 And it shall come to pass that I, the Lord God,

42
00:04:05,206 --> 00:04:10,906
 will send one mighty and strong, holding the

43
00:04:10,906 --> 00:04:16,606
 scepter of power in his hand, clothed with light for a

44
00:04:16,606 --> 00:04:22,306
 covering, whose mouth shall utter words, eternal

45
00:04:22,306 --> 00:04:28,006
 words; while his bowels shall be a fountain of

46
00:04:28,006 --> 00:04:33,706
 truth, to set in order the house of God, and to

47
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:39,406
 arrange by lot the inheritances of the saints whose

48
00:04:39,406 --> 00:04:45,106
 names are found, and the names of their fathers, and

49
00:04:45,106 --> 00:04:50,806
 of their children, enrolled in the book of the law

50
00:04:50,806 --> 00:04:56,506
 of God

51
00:04:56,48 --> 00:05:01,68
8 While that man, who was called of God and

52
00:05:01,68 --> 00:05:06,88
 appointed, that putteth forth his hand to steady the ark

53
00:05:06,88 --> 00:05:12,08
 of God, shall fall by the shaft of death, like as

54
00:05:12,08 --> 00:05:17,28
 a tree that is smitten by the vivid shaft of

55
00:05:17,28 --> 00:05:22,48
 lightning

56
00:05:22,472 --> 00:05:28,672
9 And all they who are not found written in the

57
00:05:28,672 --> 00:05:34,872
 book of remembrance shall find none inheritance in

58
00:05:34,872 --> 00:05:41,072
 that day, but they shall be cut asunder, and their

59
00:05:41,072 --> 00:05:47,272
 portion shall be appointed them among unbelievers,

60
00:05:47,272 --> 00:05:53,472
 where are wailing and gnashing of teeth

61
00:05:53,22 --> 00:06:00,22
10 These things I say not of myself; therefore, as

62
00:06:00,22 --> 00:06:07,22
 the Lord speaketh, he will also fulfil

63
00:06:07,5 --> 00:06:11,929
11 And they who are of the High Priesthood, whose

64
00:06:11,929 --> 00:06:16,358
 names are not found written in the book of the

65
00:06:16,358 --> 00:06:20,787
 law, or that are found to have apostatized, or to

66
00:06:20,787 --> 00:06:25,216
 have been cut off from the church, as well as the

67
00:06:25,216 --> 00:06:29,645
 lesser priesthood, or the members, in that day shall

68
00:06:29,645 --> 00:06:34,074
 not find an inheritance among the saints of the

69
00:06:34,074 --> 00:06:38,503
 Most High

70
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:44,982
12 Therefore, it shall be done unto them as unto

71
00:06:44,982 --> 00:06:50,982
 the children of the priest, as will be found

72
00:06:50,982 --> 00:06:56,982
 recorded in the
