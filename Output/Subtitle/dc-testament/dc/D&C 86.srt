00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 86 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, December 6,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
1832. This revelation was received while the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Prophet was reviewing and editing the manuscript of

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the translation of the Bible. 
1–7, The Lord gives

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the meaning of the parable of the wheat and

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
tares; 
8–11, He explains priesthood blessings to

8
00:00:00,0 --> 01:02:56,
those who are lawful heirs according to the flesh. 

9
01:02:56,0 --> 01:02:56,0
1 Verily, thus saith the Lord unto

10
01:02:56,0 --> 01:02:56,0
you my servants, concerning the

11
01:02:56,0 --> 01:04:00,
parable of the wheat and of the tares:

12
01:04:00,0 --> 01:04:00,0
2 Behold, verily I say, the

13
01:04:00,0 --> 01:04:00,0
field was the world, and the

14
01:04:00,0 --> 01:14:33,
apostles were the sowers of the seed;

15
01:14:33,0 --> 01:14:33,0
3 And after they have fallen

16
01:14:33,0 --> 01:14:33,0
asleep the great persecutor

17
01:14:33,0 --> 01:14:33,0
of the church, the

18
01:14:33,0 --> 01:14:33,0
apostate, the whore, even Babylon,

19
01:14:33,0 --> 01:14:33,0
that maketh all nations to

20
01:14:33,0 --> 01:14:33,0
drink of her cup, in whose

21
01:14:33,0 --> 01:14:33,0
hearts the enemy, even Satan,

22
01:14:33,0 --> 01:14:33,0
sitteth to reign—behold he

23
01:14:33,0 --> 01:14:33,0
soweth the tares; wherefore,

24
01:14:33,0 --> 01:14:33,0
the tares choke the wheat and

25
01:14:33,0 --> 01:15:37,
drive the church into the wilderness.

26
01:15:37,0 --> 01:15:37,0
4 But behold, in the

27
01:15:37,0 --> 01:15:37,0
last days, even now while

28
01:15:37,0 --> 01:15:37,0
the Lord is beginning

29
01:15:37,0 --> 01:15:37,0
to bring forth the

30
01:15:37,0 --> 01:15:37,0
word, and the blade is

31
01:15:37,0 --> 01:30:39,
springing up and is yet tender—

32
01:30:39,0 --> 01:30:39,0
5 Behold, verily I

33
01:30:39,0 --> 01:30:39,0
say unto you, the

34
01:30:39,0 --> 01:30:39,0
angels are crying unto the

35
01:30:39,0 --> 01:30:39,0
Lord day and night,

36
01:30:39,0 --> 01:30:39,0
who are ready and

37
01:30:39,0 --> 01:30:39,0
waiting to be sent forth

38
01:30:39,0 --> 02:22:12,
to reap down the fields;

39
02:22:12,0 --> 02:22:12,0
6 But the Lord

40
02:22:12,0 --> 02:22:12,0
saith unto them,

41
02:22:12,0 --> 02:22:12,0
pluck not up the tares

42
02:22:12,0 --> 02:22:12,0
while the blade

43
02:22:12,0 --> 02:22:12,0
is yet tender (for

44
02:22:12,0 --> 02:22:12,0
verily your faith

45
02:22:12,0 --> 02:22:12,0
is weak), lest you

46
02:22:12,0 --> 02:41:49,
destroy the wheat also.

47
02:41:49,0 --> 02:41:49,0
7 Therefore, let

48
02:41:49,0 --> 02:41:49,0
the wheat and the

49
02:41:49,0 --> 02:41:49,0
tares grow

50
02:41:49,0 --> 02:41:49,0
together until the

51
02:41:49,0 --> 02:41:49,0
harvest is fully

52
02:41:49,0 --> 02:41:49,0
ripe; then ye shall

53
02:41:49,0 --> 02:41:49,0
first gather out

54
02:41:49,0 --> 02:41:49,0
the wheat from

55
02:41:49,0 --> 02:41:49,0
among the tares,

56
02:41:49,0 --> 02:41:49,0
and after the

57
02:41:49,0 --> 02:41:49,0
gathering of the

58
02:41:49,0 --> 02:41:49,0
wheat, behold and lo,

59
02:41:49,0 --> 02:41:49,0
the tares are

60
02:41:49,0 --> 02:41:49,0
bound in bundles,

61
02:41:49,0 --> 02:41:49,0
and the field

62
02:41:49,0 --> 02:46:54,
remaineth to be burned.

63
02:46:54,0 --> 02:46:54,0
8 Therefore, thus

64
02:46:54,0 --> 02:46:54,0
saith the Lord

65
02:46:54,0 --> 02:46:54,0
unto you, with

66
02:46:54,0 --> 02:46:54,0
whom the priesthood

67
02:46:54,0 --> 02:46:54,0
hath continued

68
02:46:54,0 --> 02:46:54,0
through the lineage

69
02:46:54,0 --> 02:57:54,
of your fathers—

70
02:57:54,0 --> 02:57:54,0
9 For ye are

71
02:57:54,0 --> 02:57:54,0
lawful heirs,

72
02:57:54,0 --> 02:57:54,0
according to

73
02:57:54,0 --> 02:57:54,0
the flesh, and

74
02:57:54,0 --> 02:57:54,0
have been hid

75
02:57:54,0 --> 02:57:54,0
from the world

76
02:57:54,0 --> 03:00:28,
with Christ in God—

77
03:00:28,0 --> 03:00:28,0
10 Therefore

78
03:00:28,0 --> 03:00:28,0
your life and

79
03:00:28,0 --> 03:00:28,0
the

80
03:00:28,0 --> 03:00:28,0
priesthood have

81
03:00:28,0 --> 03:00:28,0
remained, and must

82
03:00:28,0 --> 03:00:28,0
needs remain

83
03:00:28,0 --> 03:00:28,0
through you

84
03:00:28,0 --> 03:00:28,0
and your

85
03:00:28,0 --> 03:00:28,0
lineage until the

86
03:00:28,0 --> 03:00:28,0
restoration

87
03:00:28,0 --> 03:00:28,0
of all things

88
03:00:28,0 --> 03:00:28,0
spoken by

89
03:00:28,0 --> 03:00:28,0
the mouths of

90
03:00:28,0 --> 03:00:28,0
all the holy

91
03:00:28,0 --> 03:00:28,0
prophets since

92
03:00:28,0 --> 03:18:30,
the world began.

93
03:18:30,0 --> 03:18:30,0
11

94
03:18:30,0 --> 03:18:30,0
Therefore, blessed

95
03:18:30,0 --> 03:18:30,0
are ye if ye

96
03:18:30,0 --> 03:18:30,0
continue in

97
03:18:30,0 --> 03:18:30,0
my goodness,

98
03:18:30,0 --> 03:18:30,0
a light unto

99
03:18:30,0 --> 03:18:30,0
the

100
03:18:30,0 --> 03:18:30,0
Gentiles, and

101
03:18:30,0 --> 03:18:30,0
through this

102
03:18:30,0 --> 03:18:30,0
priesthood, a

103
03:18:30,0 --> 03:18:30,0
savior unto my

104
03:18:30,0 --> 03:18:30,0
people

105
03:18:30,0 --> 03:18:30,0
Israel. The Lord

106
03:18:30,0 --> 03:24:35,
hath said it. Amen.
