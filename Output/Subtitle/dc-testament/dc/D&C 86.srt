00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:17,903
Section 86 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:17,903 --> 00:00:24,528
 the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, December 6, 1832.

3
00:00:24,528 --> 00:00:31,153
 This revelation was received while the Prophet was

4
00:00:31,153 --> 00:00:37,778
 reviewing and editing the manuscript of the

5
00:00:37,778 --> 00:00:44,403
 translation of the Bible. 
1–7, The Lord gives the

6
00:00:44,403 --> 00:00:51,028
 meaning of the parable of the wheat and tares; 
8–11,

7
00:00:51,028 --> 00:00:57,653
 He explains priesthood blessings to those who are

8
00:00:57,653 --> 00:01:04,278
 lawful heirs according to the flesh.

9
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:08,965
1 Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you my

10
00:01:08,965 --> 00:01:12,965
 servants, concerning the parable of the wheat and of the

11
00:01:12,965 --> 00:01:16,965
 tares

12
00:01:16,727 --> 00:01:24,227
2 Behold, verily I say, the field was the world,

13
00:01:24,227 --> 00:01:31,727
 and the apostles were the sowers of the seed

14
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:39,421
3 And after they have fallen asleep the great

15
00:01:39,421 --> 00:01:46,85
 persecutor of the church, the apostate, the whore,

16
00:01:46,85 --> 00:01:54,279
 even Babylon, that maketh all nations to drink of her

17
00:01:54,279 --> 00:02:01,708
 cup, in whose hearts the enemy, even Satan,

18
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:09,137
 sitteth to reign—behold he soweth the tares; wherefore,

19
00:02:09,137 --> 00:02:16,566
 the tares choke the wheat and drive the church

20
00:02:16,566 --> 00:02:23,995
 into the wilderness

21
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:29,576
4 But behold, in the last days, even now while the

22
00:02:29,576 --> 00:02:35,909
 Lord is beginning to bring forth the word, and

23
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:42,242
 the blade is springing up and is yet tender

24
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:46,995
5 Behold, verily I say unto you, the angels are

25
00:02:46,995 --> 00:02:51,745
 crying unto the Lord day and night, who are ready

26
00:02:51,745 --> 00:02:56,495
 and waiting to be sent forth to reap down the

27
00:02:56,495 --> 00:03:01,245
 fields

28
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:07,498
6 But the Lord saith unto them, pluck not up the

29
00:03:07,498 --> 00:03:13,748
 tares while the blade is yet tender (for verily

30
00:03:13,748 --> 00:03:19,998
 your faith is weak), lest you destroy the wheat also

31
00:03:19,998 --> 00:03:26,248


32
00:03:26,79 --> 00:03:32,957
7 Therefore, let the wheat and the tares grow

33
00:03:32,957 --> 00:03:39,124
 together until the harvest is fully ripe; then ye

34
00:03:39,124 --> 00:03:45,291
 shall first gather out the wheat from among the tares,

35
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:51,458
 and after the gathering of the wheat, behold and

36
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:57,625
 lo, the tares are bound in bundles, and the field

37
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:03,792
 remaineth to be burned

38
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:08,21
8 Therefore, thus saith the Lord unto you, with

39
00:04:08,21 --> 00:04:12,877
 whom the priesthood hath continued through the

40
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:17,544
 lineage of your fathers

41
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:22,824
9 For ye are lawful heirs, according to the flesh,

42
00:04:22,824 --> 00:04:27,824
 and have been hid from the world with Christ in

43
00:04:27,824 --> 00:04:32,824
 God

44
00:04:32,589 --> 00:04:36,989
10 Therefore your life and the priesthood have

45
00:04:36,989 --> 00:04:41,389
 remained, and must needs remain through you and your

46
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:45,789
 lineage until the restoration of all things spoken

47
00:04:45,789 --> 00:04:50,189
 by the mouths of all the holy prophets since the

48
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:54,589
 world began

49
00:04:54,344 --> 00:05:01,094
11 Therefore, blessed are ye if ye continue in my

50
00:05:01,094 --> 00:05:07,844
 goodness, a light unto the Gentiles, and through

51
00:05:07,844 --> 00:05:14,594
 this priesthood, a savior unto my people Israel.

52
00:05:14,594 --> 00:05:21,344
 The Lord hath said it. Amen.
