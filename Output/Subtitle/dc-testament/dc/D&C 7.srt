00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:21,778
Section 7 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet and 

2
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:32,278
Oliver Cowdery, at Harmony, Pennsylvania, April 1829, when they inquired 

3
00:00:32,278 --> 00:00:42,778
through the Urim and Thummim as to whether John, the 

4
00:00:42,778 --> 00:00:53,278
beloved disciple, tarried in the flesh or had died. The 

5
00:00:53,278 --> 00:01:03,778
revelation is a translated version of the record made on 

6
00:01:03,778 --> 00:01:14,278
parchment by John and hidden up by himself. 
1–3, John 

7
00:01:14,278 --> 00:01:24,778
the Beloved will live until the Lord comes; 
4–8, Peter, 

8
00:01:24,778 --> 00:01:35,896
James, and John hold gospel keys.  

9
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:41,563
1 And the Lord said unto me: John, my beloved, 

10
00:01:41,563 --> 00:01:47,23
what desirest thou? For if you shall ask what you 

11
00:01:47,23 --> 00:01:52,679
will, it shall be granted unto you. 

12
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:56,679
2 And I said unto him: Lord, give unto me 

13
00:01:56,679 --> 00:02:00,679
power over death, that I may live and bring souls 

14
00:02:00,679 --> 00:02:04,992
unto thee. 

15
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:10,742
3 And the Lord said unto me: Verily, verily, I 

16
00:02:10,742 --> 00:02:16,492
say unto thee, because thou desirest this thou shalt tarry 

17
00:02:16,492 --> 00:02:22,242
until I come in my glory, and shalt prophesy before 

18
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:27,748
nations, kindreds, tongues and people. 

19
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:34,148
4 And for this cause the Lord said unto Peter: 

20
00:02:34,148 --> 00:02:40,548
If I will that he tarry till I come, what 

21
00:02:40,548 --> 00:02:46,948
is that to thee? For he desired of me that 

22
00:02:46,948 --> 00:02:53,348
he might bring souls unto me, but thou desiredst that 

23
00:02:53,348 --> 00:02:59,88
thou mightest speedily come unto me in my kingdom. 

24
00:02:59,88 --> 00:03:04,88
5 I say unto thee, Peter, this was a good 

25
00:03:04,88 --> 00:03:09,88
desire; but my beloved has desired that he might do 

26
00:03:09,88 --> 00:03:14,88
more, or a greater work yet among men than what 

27
00:03:14,88 --> 00:03:19,666
he has before done. 

28
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:26,166
6 Yea, he has undertaken a greater work; therefore I 

29
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:32,666
will make him as flaming fire and a ministering angel; 

30
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:39,166
he shall minister for those who shall be heirs of 

31
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:45,776
salvation who dwell on the earth. 

32
00:03:45,776 --> 00:03:51,276
7 And I will make thee to minister for him 

33
00:03:51,276 --> 00:03:56,776
and for thy brother James; and unto you three I 

34
00:03:56,776 --> 00:04:02,276
will give this power and the keys of this ministry 

35
00:04:02,276 --> 00:04:07,33
until I come. 

36
00:04:07,33 --> 00:04:07,997
8 Verily I say unto you, ye shall both have 

37
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:08,664
according to your desires, for ye both joy in that 

38
00:04:08,664 --> 00:04:09,699
which ye have desired.
