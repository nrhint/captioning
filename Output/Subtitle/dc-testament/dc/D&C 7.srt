Section 7 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Prophet and Oliver Cowdery, at Harmony,

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Pennsylvania, April 1829, when they inquired through the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Urim and Thummim as to whether John, the beloved

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
disciple, tarried in the flesh or had died. The

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
revelation is a translated version of the record made

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
on parchment by John and hidden up by himself.

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
1–3, John the Beloved will live until the Lord

9
00:00:00,0 --> 01:34:52,
comes; 
4–8, Peter, James, and John hold gospel keys. 

10
01:34:52,0 --> 01:34:52,0
1 And the Lord said unto me: John, my

11
01:34:52,0 --> 01:34:52,0
beloved, what desirest thou? For if you shall ask

12
01:34:52,0 --> 01:51:54,
what you will, it shall be granted unto you.

13
01:51:54,0 --> 01:51:54,0
2 And I said unto him: Lord, give

14
01:51:54,0 --> 01:51:54,0
unto me power over death, that I

15
01:51:54,0 --> 02:04:00,
may live and bring souls unto thee.

16
02:04:00,0 --> 02:04:00,0
3 And the Lord said unto me:

17
02:04:00,0 --> 02:04:00,0
Verily, verily, I say unto thee,

18
02:04:00,0 --> 02:04:00,0
because thou desirest this thou

19
02:04:00,0 --> 02:04:00,0
shalt tarry until I come in my

20
02:04:00,0 --> 02:04:00,0
glory, and shalt prophesy before

21
02:04:00,0 --> 02:27:01,
nations, kindreds, tongues and people.

22
02:27:01,0 --> 02:27:01,0
4 And for this cause the Lord

23
02:27:01,0 --> 02:27:01,0
said unto Peter: If I will

24
02:27:01,0 --> 02:27:01,0
that he tarry till I come,

25
02:27:01,0 --> 02:27:01,0
what is that to thee? For he

26
02:27:01,0 --> 02:27:01,0
desired of me that he might

27
02:27:01,0 --> 02:27:01,0
bring souls unto me, but thou

28
02:27:01,0 --> 02:27:01,0
desiredst that thou mightest

29
02:27:01,0 --> 02:58:00,
speedily come unto me in my kingdom.

30
02:58:00,0 --> 02:58:00,0
5 I say unto thee, Peter,

31
02:58:00,0 --> 02:58:00,0
this was a good desire;

32
02:58:00,0 --> 02:58:00,0
but my beloved has desired

33
02:58:00,0 --> 02:58:00,0
that he might do more, or a

34
02:58:00,0 --> 02:58:00,0
greater work yet among

35
02:58:00,0 --> 02:53:40,
men than what he has before done.

36
02:53:40,0 --> 02:53:40,0
6 Yea, he has

37
02:53:40,0 --> 02:53:40,0
undertaken a greater work;

38
02:53:40,0 --> 02:53:40,0
therefore I will make him as

39
02:53:40,0 --> 02:53:40,0
flaming fire and a

40
02:53:40,0 --> 02:53:40,0
ministering angel; he

41
02:53:40,0 --> 02:53:40,0
shall minister for those

42
02:53:40,0 --> 02:53:40,0
who shall be heirs of

43
02:53:40,0 --> 02:57:47,
salvation who dwell on the earth.

44
02:57:47,0 --> 02:57:47,0
7 And I will make thee

45
02:57:47,0 --> 02:57:47,0
to minister for him

46
02:57:47,0 --> 02:57:47,0
and for thy brother

47
02:57:47,0 --> 02:57:47,0
James; and unto you three

48
02:57:47,0 --> 02:57:47,0
I will give this

49
02:57:47,0 --> 02:57:47,0
power and the keys of this

50
02:57:47,0 --> 02:58:51,
ministry until I come.

51
02:58:51,0 --> 02:58:51,0
8 Verily I say unto

52
02:58:51,0 --> 02:58:51,0
you, ye shall both

53
02:58:51,0 --> 02:58:51,0
have according to

54
02:58:51,0 --> 02:58:51,0
your desires, for

55
02:58:51,0 --> 02:58:51,0
ye both joy in that

56
02:58:51,0 --> 03:18:56,
which ye have desired.
