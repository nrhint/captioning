00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:20,611
Section 7 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:29,944
 Prophet and Oliver Cowdery, at Harmony, Pennsylvania,

3
00:00:29,944 --> 00:00:39,277
 April 1829, when they inquired through the Urim

4
00:00:39,277 --> 00:00:48,61
 and Thummim as to whether John, the beloved

5
00:00:48,61 --> 00:00:57,943
 disciple, tarried in the flesh or had died. The

6
00:00:57,943 --> 00:01:07,276
 revelation is a translated version of the record made on

7
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:16,609
 parchment by John and hidden up by himself. 
1â€“3,

8
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:25,942
 John the Beloved will live until the Lord comes;

9
00:01:25,942 --> 00:01:35,275
4â€“8, Peter, James, and John hold gospel keys.

10
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:41,563
1 And the Lord said unto me: John, my beloved,

11
00:01:41,563 --> 00:01:47,23
 what desirest thou? For if you shall ask what you

12
00:01:47,23 --> 00:01:52,897
 will, it shall be granted unto you

13
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:56,679
2 And I said unto him: Lord, give unto me power

14
00:01:56,679 --> 00:02:00,679
 over death, that I may live and bring souls unto

15
00:02:00,679 --> 00:02:04,679
 thee

16
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:10,742
3 And the Lord said unto me: Verily, verily, I say

17
00:02:10,742 --> 00:02:16,492
 unto thee, because thou desirest this thou shalt

18
00:02:16,492 --> 00:02:22,242
 tarry until I come in my glory, and shalt prophesy

19
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:27,992
 before nations, kindreds, tongues and people

20
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:34,148
4 And for this cause the Lord said unto Peter: If

21
00:02:34,148 --> 00:02:40,548
 I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to

22
00:02:40,548 --> 00:02:46,948
 thee? For he desired of me that he might bring

23
00:02:46,948 --> 00:02:53,348
 souls unto me, but thou desiredst that thou mightest

24
00:02:53,348 --> 00:02:59,748
 speedily come unto me in my kingdom

25
00:02:59,88 --> 00:03:04,88
5 I say unto thee, Peter, this was a good desire;

26
00:03:04,88 --> 00:03:09,88
 but my beloved has desired that he might do more,

27
00:03:09,88 --> 00:03:14,88
 or a greater work yet among men than what he has

28
00:03:14,88 --> 00:03:19,88
 before done

29
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:26,166
6 Yea, he has undertaken a greater work; therefore

30
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:32,666
 I will make him as flaming fire and a ministering

31
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:39,166
 angel; he shall minister for those who shall be

32
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:45,666
 heirs of salvation who dwell on the earth

33
00:03:45,776 --> 00:03:51,276
7 And I will make thee to minister for him and for

34
00:03:51,276 --> 00:03:56,776
 thy brother James; and unto you three I will give

35
00:03:56,776 --> 00:04:02,276
 this power and the keys of this ministry until I

36
00:04:02,276 --> 00:04:07,776
 come

37
00:04:07,33 --> 00:04:07,997
8 Verily I say unto you, ye shall both have

38
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:08,664
 according to your desires, for ye both joy in that which

39
00:04:08,664 --> 00:04:09,331
 ye have desired.
