00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:10,0
Section 7 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:10,0 --> 00:00:20,0
Prophet and Oliver Cowdery, at Harmony,

3
00:00:20,0 --> 00:00:30,0
Pennsylvania, April 1829, when they inquired through the

4
00:00:30,0 --> 00:00:40,0
Urim and Thummim as to whether John, the beloved

5
00:00:40,0 --> 00:00:50,0
disciple, tarried in the flesh or had died. The

6
00:00:50,0 --> 00:01:00,0
revelation is a translated version of the record made

7
00:01:00,0 --> 00:01:10,0
on parchment by John and hidden up by himself.

8
00:01:10,0 --> 00:01:20,0
1–3, John the Beloved will live until the Lord

9
00:01:20,0 --> 00:01:30,924
comes; 
4–8, Peter, James, and John hold gospel keys. 

10
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,591
1 And the Lord said unto me: John, my

11
00:01:32,591 --> 00:01:34,258
beloved, what desirest thou? For if you shall ask

12
00:01:34,258 --> 00:01:35,045
what you will, it shall be granted unto you.

13
00:01:35,045 --> 00:01:37,378
2 And I said unto him: Lord, give

14
00:01:37,378 --> 00:01:39,711
unto me power over death, that I

15
00:01:39,711 --> 00:01:42,085
may live and bring souls unto thee.

16
00:01:42,085 --> 00:01:43,752
3 And the Lord said unto me:

17
00:01:43,752 --> 00:01:45,419
Verily, verily, I say unto thee,

18
00:01:45,419 --> 00:01:47,086
because thou desirest this thou

19
00:01:47,086 --> 00:01:48,753
shalt tarry until I come in my

20
00:01:48,753 --> 00:01:50,42
glory, and shalt prophesy before

21
00:01:50,42 --> 00:01:52,145
nations, kindreds, tongues and people.

22
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:54,645
4 And for this cause the Lord

23
00:01:54,645 --> 00:01:57,145
said unto Peter: If I will

24
00:01:57,145 --> 00:01:59,645
that he tarry till I come,

25
00:01:59,645 --> 00:02:02,145
what is that to thee? For he

26
00:02:02,145 --> 00:02:04,645
desired of me that he might

27
00:02:04,645 --> 00:02:07,145
bring souls unto me, but thou

28
00:02:07,145 --> 00:02:09,645
desiredst that thou mightest

29
00:02:09,645 --> 00:02:12,249
speedily come unto me in my kingdom.

30
00:02:12,249 --> 00:02:14,582
5 I say unto thee, Peter,

31
00:02:14,582 --> 00:02:16,915
this was a good desire;

32
00:02:16,915 --> 00:02:19,248
but my beloved has desired

33
00:02:19,248 --> 00:02:21,581
that he might do more, or a

34
00:02:21,581 --> 00:02:23,914
greater work yet among

35
00:02:23,914 --> 00:02:26,83
men than what he has before done.

36
00:02:26,83 --> 00:02:28,955
6 Yea, he has

37
00:02:28,955 --> 00:02:31,08
undertaken a greater work;

38
00:02:31,08 --> 00:02:33,205
therefore I will make him as

39
00:02:33,205 --> 00:02:35,33
flaming fire and a

40
00:02:35,33 --> 00:02:37,455
ministering angel; he

41
00:02:37,455 --> 00:02:39,58
shall minister for those

42
00:02:39,58 --> 00:02:41,705
who shall be heirs of

43
00:02:41,705 --> 00:02:43,864
salvation who dwell on the earth.

44
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:46,007
7 And I will make thee

45
00:02:46,007 --> 00:02:48,15
to minister for him

46
00:02:48,15 --> 00:02:50,293
and for thy brother

47
00:02:50,293 --> 00:02:52,436
James; and unto you three

48
00:02:52,436 --> 00:02:54,579
I will give this

49
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:56,722
power and the keys of this

50
00:02:56,722 --> 00:02:58,912
ministry until I come.

51
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:02,079
8 Verily I say unto

52
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:05,246
you, ye shall both

53
00:03:05,246 --> 00:03:08,413
have according to

54
00:03:08,413 --> 00:03:11,58
your desires, for

55
00:03:11,58 --> 00:03:14,747
ye both joy in that

56
00:03:14,747 --> 00:03:17,931
which ye have desired.
