00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:18,914
Section 100 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:18,914 --> 00:00:26,55
 Prophet and Sidney Rigdon, at Perrysburg, New York,

3
00:00:26,55 --> 00:00:34,186
 October 12, 1833. The two brethren, having been

4
00:00:34,186 --> 00:00:41,822
 absent from their families for several days, felt

5
00:00:41,822 --> 00:00:49,458
 some concern about them. 
1–4, Joseph and Sidney to

6
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:57,094
 preach the gospel for the salvation of souls;

7
00:00:57,094 --> 00:01:04,73
5–8, It will be given them in the very hour what

8
00:01:04,73 --> 00:01:12,366
 they should say; 
9–12, Sidney is to be a spokesman

9
00:01:12,366 --> 00:01:20,002
 and Joseph is to be a revelator and mighty in

10
00:01:20,002 --> 00:01:27,638
 testimony; 
13–17, The Lord will raise up a pure

11
00:01:27,638 --> 00:01:35,274
 people, and the obedient will be saved.

12
00:01:35,412 --> 00:01:41,412
1 Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you, my friends

13
00:01:41,412 --> 00:01:47,412
 Sidney and Joseph, your families are well; they

14
00:01:47,412 --> 00:01:53,412
 are in mine hands, and I will do with them as

15
00:01:53,412 --> 00:01:59,412
 seemeth me good; for in me there is all power

16
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:03,203
2 Therefore, follow me, and listen to the counsel

17
00:02:03,203 --> 00:02:06,703
 which I shall give unto you

18
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:12,727
3 Behold, and lo, I have much people in this

19
00:02:12,727 --> 00:02:18,727
 place, in the regions round about; and an effectual

20
00:02:18,727 --> 00:02:24,727
 door shall be opened in the regions round about in

21
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:30,727
 this eastern land

22
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:33,884
4 Therefore, I, the Lord, have suffered you to

23
00:02:33,884 --> 00:02:37,551
 come unto this place; for thus it was expedient in me

24
00:02:37,551 --> 00:02:41,218
 for the salvation of souls

25
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:46,745
5 Therefore, verily I say unto you, lift up your

26
00:02:46,745 --> 00:02:51,995
 voices unto this people; speak the thoughts that I

27
00:02:51,995 --> 00:02:57,245
 shall put into your hearts, and you shall not be

28
00:02:57,245 --> 00:03:02,495
 confounded before men

29
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:08,766
6 For it shall be given you in the very hour, yea,

30
00:03:08,766 --> 00:03:14,766
 in the very moment, what ye shall say

31
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:19,028
7 But a commandment I give unto you, that ye shall

32
00:03:19,028 --> 00:03:23,528
 declare whatsoever thing ye declare in my name,

33
00:03:23,528 --> 00:03:28,028
 in solemnity of heart, in the spirit of meekness,

34
00:03:28,028 --> 00:03:32,528
 in all things

35
00:03:32,062 --> 00:03:34,062
8 And I give unto you this promise, that inasmuch

36
00:03:34,062 --> 00:03:36,062
 as ye do this the Holy Ghost shall be shed forth

37
00:03:36,062 --> 00:03:38,062
 in bearing record unto all things whatsoever ye

38
00:03:38,062 --> 00:03:40,062
 shall say

39
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:47,303
9 And it is expedient in me that you, my servant

40
00:03:47,303 --> 00:03:54,553
 Sidney, should be a spokesman unto this people;

41
00:03:54,553 --> 00:04:01,803
 yea, verily, I will ordain you unto this calling,

42
00:04:01,803 --> 00:04:09,053
 even to be a spokesman unto my servant Joseph

43
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:12,049
10 And I will give unto him power to be mighty in

44
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:15,049
 testimony

45
00:04:15,572 --> 00:04:19,572
11 And I will give unto thee power to be mighty in

46
00:04:19,572 --> 00:04:23,572
 expounding all scriptures, that thou mayest be a

47
00:04:23,572 --> 00:04:27,572
 spokesman unto him, and he shall be a revelator

48
00:04:27,572 --> 00:04:31,572
 unto thee, that thou mayest know the certainty of

49
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:35,572
 all things pertaining to the things of my kingdom on

50
00:04:35,572 --> 00:04:39,572
 the earth

51
00:04:39,062 --> 00:04:43,729
12 Therefore, continue your journey and let your

52
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:48,396
 hearts rejoice; for behold, and lo, I am with you

53
00:04:48,396 --> 00:04:53,063
 even unto the end

54
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:57,76
13 And now I give unto you a word concerning Zion.

55
00:04:57,76 --> 00:05:02,427
 Zion shall be redeemed, although she is chastened

56
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:07,094
 for a little season

57
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:13,374
14 Thy brethren, my servants Orson Hyde and John

58
00:05:13,374 --> 00:05:19,374
 Gould, are in my hands; and inasmuch as they keep

59
00:05:19,374 --> 00:05:25,374
 my commandments they shall be saved

60
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,658
15 Therefore, let your hearts be comforted; for

61
00:05:28,658 --> 00:05:32,158
 all things shall work together for good to them that

62
00:05:32,158 --> 00:05:35,658
 walk uprightly, and to the sanctification of the

63
00:05:35,658 --> 00:05:39,158
 church

64
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:44,423
16 For I will raise up unto myself a pure people,

65
00:05:44,423 --> 00:05:48,923
 that will serve me in righteousness

66
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:51,616
17 And all that call upon the name of the Lord,

67
00:05:51,616 --> 00:05:54,283
 and keep his commandments, shall be saved. Even so.

68
00:05:54,283 --> 00:05:56,95
 Amen.
