00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 100 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Prophet and Sidney Rigdon, at Perrysburg, New

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
York, October 12, 1833. The two brethren, having

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
been absent from their families for several

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
days, felt some concern about them. 
1–4, Joseph and

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Sidney to preach the gospel for the salvation

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of souls; 
5–8, It will be given them in the very

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
hour what they should say; 
9–12, Sidney is to

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
be a spokesman and Joseph is to be a revelator

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and mighty in testimony; 
13–17, The Lord will

11
00:00:00,0 --> 01:34:52,
raise up a pure people, and the obedient will be saved. 

12
01:34:52,0 --> 01:34:52,0
1 Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you, my

13
01:34:52,0 --> 01:34:52,0
friends Sidney and Joseph, your families are well;

14
01:34:52,0 --> 01:34:52,0
they are in mine hands, and I will do with them

15
01:34:52,0 --> 01:57:52,
as seemeth me good; for in me there is all power.

16
01:57:52,0 --> 01:57:52,0
2 Therefore, follow me, and listen to

17
01:57:52,0 --> 01:53:32,
the counsel which I shall give unto you.

18
01:53:32,0 --> 01:53:32,0
3 Behold, and lo, I have much

19
01:53:32,0 --> 01:53:32,0
people in this place, in the regions

20
01:53:32,0 --> 01:53:32,0
round about; and an effectual

21
01:53:32,0 --> 01:53:32,0
door shall be opened in the regions

22
01:53:32,0 --> 01:57:11,
round about in this eastern land.

23
01:57:11,0 --> 01:57:11,0
4 Therefore, I, the Lord, have

24
01:57:11,0 --> 01:57:11,0
suffered you to come unto this

25
01:57:11,0 --> 01:57:11,0
place; for thus it was expedient

26
01:57:11,0 --> 01:58:15,
in me for the salvation of souls.

27
01:58:15,0 --> 01:58:15,0
5 Therefore, verily I say

28
01:58:15,0 --> 01:58:15,0
unto you, lift up your voices

29
01:58:15,0 --> 01:58:15,0
unto this people; speak the

30
01:58:15,0 --> 01:58:15,0
thoughts that I shall put

31
01:58:15,0 --> 01:58:15,0
into your hearts, and you

32
01:58:15,0 --> 02:05:18,
shall not be confounded before men;

33
02:05:18,0 --> 02:05:18,0
6 For it shall be

34
02:05:18,0 --> 02:05:18,0
given you in the very

35
02:05:18,0 --> 02:05:18,0
hour, yea, in the very

36
02:05:18,0 --> 02:28:18,
moment, what ye shall say.

37
02:28:18,0 --> 02:28:18,0
7 But a commandment

38
02:28:18,0 --> 02:28:18,0
I give unto you,

39
02:28:18,0 --> 02:28:18,0
that ye shall declare

40
02:28:18,0 --> 02:28:18,0
whatsoever thing ye

41
02:28:18,0 --> 02:28:18,0
declare in my name,

42
02:28:18,0 --> 02:28:18,0
in solemnity of

43
02:28:18,0 --> 02:28:18,0
heart, in the spirit of

44
02:28:18,0 --> 02:23:58,
meekness, in all things.

45
02:23:58,0 --> 02:23:58,0
8 And I give unto

46
02:23:58,0 --> 02:23:58,0
you this promise,

47
02:23:58,0 --> 02:23:58,0
that inasmuch as ye

48
02:23:58,0 --> 02:23:58,0
do this the Holy

49
02:23:58,0 --> 02:23:58,0
Ghost shall be shed

50
02:23:58,0 --> 02:23:58,0
forth in bearing

51
02:23:58,0 --> 02:23:58,0
record unto all things

52
02:23:58,0 --> 02:29:03,
whatsoever ye shall say.

53
02:29:03,0 --> 02:29:03,0
9 And it is

54
02:29:03,0 --> 02:29:03,0
expedient in me that

55
02:29:03,0 --> 02:29:03,0
you, my servant

56
02:29:03,0 --> 02:29:03,0
Sidney, should be a

57
02:29:03,0 --> 02:29:03,0
spokesman unto

58
02:29:03,0 --> 02:29:03,0
this people; yea,

59
02:29:03,0 --> 02:29:03,0
verily, I will

60
02:29:03,0 --> 02:29:03,0
ordain you unto

61
02:29:03,0 --> 02:29:03,0
this calling, even

62
02:29:03,0 --> 02:29:03,0
to be a spokesman

63
02:29:03,0 --> 02:28:41,
unto my servant Joseph.

64
02:28:41,0 --> 02:28:41,0
10 And I will

65
02:28:41,0 --> 02:28:41,0
give unto him

66
02:28:41,0 --> 02:28:41,0
power to be

67
02:28:41,0 --> 02:24:21,
mighty in testimony.

68
02:24:21,0 --> 02:24:21,0
11 And I will

69
02:24:21,0 --> 02:24:21,0
give unto thee

70
02:24:21,0 --> 02:24:21,0
power to be

71
02:24:21,0 --> 02:24:21,0
mighty in

72
02:24:21,0 --> 02:24:21,0
expounding all

73
02:24:21,0 --> 02:24:21,0
scriptures, that

74
02:24:21,0 --> 02:24:21,0
thou mayest be

75
02:24:21,0 --> 02:24:21,0
a spokesman

76
02:24:21,0 --> 02:24:21,0
unto him, and he

77
02:24:21,0 --> 02:24:21,0
shall be a

78
02:24:21,0 --> 02:24:21,0
revelator unto

79
02:24:21,0 --> 02:24:21,0
thee, that thou

80
02:24:21,0 --> 02:24:21,0
mayest know

81
02:24:21,0 --> 02:24:21,0
the certainty

82
02:24:21,0 --> 02:24:21,0
of all things

83
02:24:21,0 --> 02:24:21,0
pertaining to

84
02:24:21,0 --> 02:24:21,0
the things of

85
02:24:21,0 --> 02:29:26,
my kingdom on the earth.

86
02:29:26,0 --> 02:29:26,0
12 Therefore,

87
02:29:26,0 --> 02:29:26,0
continue

88
02:29:26,0 --> 02:29:26,0
your journey and

89
02:29:26,0 --> 02:29:26,0
let your

90
02:29:26,0 --> 02:29:26,0
hearts rejoice;

91
02:29:26,0 --> 02:29:26,0
for behold,

92
02:29:26,0 --> 02:29:26,0
and lo, I am

93
02:29:26,0 --> 02:29:26,0
with you even

94
02:29:26,0 --> 02:41:04,
unto the end.

95
02:41:04,0 --> 02:41:04,0
13 And now I

96
02:41:04,0 --> 02:41:04,0
give unto

97
02:41:04,0 --> 02:41:04,0
you a word

98
02:41:04,0 --> 02:41:04,0
concerning

99
02:41:04,0 --> 02:41:04,0
Zion. Zion

100
02:41:04,0 --> 02:41:04,0
shall be

101
02:41:04,0 --> 02:41:04,0
redeemed, although

102
02:41:04,0 --> 02:41:04,0
she is

103
02:41:04,0 --> 02:41:04,0
chastened for a

104
02:41:04,0 --> 03:02:07,
little season.

105
03:02:07,0 --> 03:02:07,0
14 Thy

106
03:02:07,0 --> 03:02:07,0
brethren, my

107
03:02:07,0 --> 03:02:07,0
servants

108
03:02:07,0 --> 03:02:07,0
Orson Hyde and

109
03:02:07,0 --> 03:02:07,0
John Gould,

110
03:02:07,0 --> 03:02:07,0
are in my

111
03:02:07,0 --> 03:02:07,0
hands; and

112
03:02:07,0 --> 03:02:07,0
inasmuch as

113
03:02:07,0 --> 03:02:07,0
they keep

114
03:02:07,0 --> 03:02:07,0
my

115
03:02:07,0 --> 03:02:07,0
commandments they

116
03:02:07,0 --> 03:13:45,
shall be saved.

117
03:13:45,0 --> 03:13:45,0
15

118
03:13:45,0 --> 03:13:45,0
Therefore, let

119
03:13:45,0 --> 03:13:45,0
your hearts

120
03:13:45,0 --> 03:13:45,0
be

121
03:13:45,0 --> 03:13:45,0
comforted; for

122
03:13:45,0 --> 03:13:45,0
all things

123
03:13:45,0 --> 03:13:45,0
shall work

124
03:13:45,0 --> 03:13:45,0
together

125
03:13:45,0 --> 03:13:45,0
for good to

126
03:13:45,0 --> 03:13:45,0
them that

127
03:13:45,0 --> 03:13:45,0
walk

128
03:13:45,0 --> 03:13:45,0
uprightly, and

129
03:13:45,0 --> 03:13:45,0
to the

130
03:13:45,0 --> 03:13:45,0


131
03:13:45,0 --> 03:28:47,
sanctification of the church.

132
03:28:47,0 --> 03:28:47,0
16 For I

133
03:28:47,0 --> 03:28:47,0
will

134
03:28:47,0 --> 03:28:47,0
raise up unto

135
03:28:47,0 --> 03:28:47,0
myself a

136
03:28:47,0 --> 03:28:47,0
pure

137
03:28:47,0 --> 03:28:47,0
people, that

138
03:28:47,0 --> 03:28:47,0
will

139
03:28:47,0 --> 03:28:47,0
serve me in

140
03:28:47,0 --> 03:30:51,
righteousness;

141
03:30:51,0 --> 03:30:51,0
17 And

142
03:30:51,0 --> 03:30:51,0
all that

143
03:30:51,0 --> 03:30:51,0
call

144
03:30:51,0 --> 03:30:51,0
upon the

145
03:30:51,0 --> 03:30:51,0
name of

146
03:30:51,0 --> 03:30:51,0
the Lord,

147
03:30:51,0 --> 03:30:51,0
and keep

148
03:30:51,0 --> 03:30:51,0
his

149
03:30:51,0 --> 03:30:51,0


150
03:30:51,0 --> 03:30:51,0
commandments, shall

151
03:30:51,0 --> 03:30:51,0
be

152
03:30:51,0 --> 03:30:29,
saved. Even so. Amen.
