00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:07,312
Section 17 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:07,312 --> 00:00:14,624
the Prophet to Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and

3
00:00:14,624 --> 00:00:21,936
Martin Harris, at Fayette, New York, June 1829,

4
00:00:21,936 --> 00:00:29,248
prior to their viewing the engraved plates that

5
00:00:29,248 --> 00:00:36,56
contained the Book of Mormon record. Joseph and

6
00:00:36,56 --> 00:00:43,872
his scribe, Oliver Cowdery, had learned from the

7
00:00:43,872 --> 00:00:51,184
translation of the Book of Mormon plates that three

8
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:58,496
special witnesses would be designated (see

9
00:00:58,496 --> 00:01:05,808
Ether 5:2–4; 
2 Nephi 11:3; 
27:12). Oliver Cowdery,

10
00:01:05,808 --> 00:01:13,12
David Whitmer, and Martin Harris were moved upon

11
00:01:13,12 --> 00:01:20,432
by an inspired desire to be the three special

12
00:01:20,432 --> 00:01:27,744
witnesses. The Prophet inquired of the Lord, and

13
00:01:27,744 --> 00:01:35,056
this revelation was given in answer through the Urim

14
00:01:35,056 --> 00:01:42,368
and Thummim. 
1–4, By faith the Three Witnesses

15
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:49,68
will see the plates and other sacred items; 
5–9,

16
00:01:49,68 --> 00:01:57,951
Christ bears testimony of the divinity of the Book of Mormon. 

17
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,173
1 Behold, I say unto you, that you must rely

18
00:01:59,173 --> 00:02:00,395
upon my word, which if you do with full purpose

19
00:02:00,395 --> 00:02:01,617
of heart, you shall have a view of the

20
00:02:01,617 --> 00:02:02,839
plates, and also of the breastplate, the sword of

21
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:04,061
Laban, the Urim and Thummim, which were given to

22
00:02:04,061 --> 00:02:05,283
the brother of Jared upon the mount, when he

23
00:02:05,283 --> 00:02:06,505
talked with the Lord face to face, and the

24
00:02:06,505 --> 00:02:07,727
miraculous directors which were given to Lehi

25
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:08,328
while in the wilderness, on the borders of the Red Sea.

26
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:12,995
2 And it is by your faith that you shall

27
00:02:12,995 --> 00:02:17,662
obtain a view of them, even by that

28
00:02:17,662 --> 00:02:22,609
faith which was had by the prophets of old.

29
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:33,109
3 And after that you have

30
00:02:33,109 --> 00:02:43,609
obtained faith, and have seen them

31
00:02:43,609 --> 00:02:54,109
with your eyes, you shall

32
00:02:54,109 --> 00:03:04,851
testify of them, by the power of God;

33
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,684
4 And this you shall do

34
00:03:06,684 --> 00:03:08,517
that my servant Joseph Smith,

35
00:03:08,517 --> 00:03:10,35
Jun., may not be destroyed,

36
00:03:10,35 --> 00:03:12,183
that I may bring about my

37
00:03:12,183 --> 00:03:14,016
righteous purposes unto the

38
00:03:14,016 --> 00:03:15,228
children of men in this work.

39
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:17,371
5 And ye shall testify

40
00:03:17,371 --> 00:03:19,514
that you have seen them,

41
00:03:19,514 --> 00:03:21,657
even as my servant Joseph

42
00:03:21,657 --> 00:03:23,8
Smith, Jun., has seen

43
00:03:23,8 --> 00:03:25,943
them; for it is by my power

44
00:03:25,943 --> 00:03:28,086
that he has seen them, and

45
00:03:28,086 --> 00:03:30,243
it is because he had faith.

46
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:33,243
6 And he has translated

47
00:03:33,243 --> 00:03:36,243
the book, even that part

48
00:03:36,243 --> 00:03:39,243
which I have commanded

49
00:03:39,243 --> 00:03:42,243
him, and as your Lord and

50
00:03:42,243 --> 00:03:45,726
your God liveth it is true.

51
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:52,226
7 Wherefore, you have

52
00:03:52,226 --> 00:03:58,726
received the same power,

53
00:03:58,726 --> 00:04:05,226
and the same faith, and

54
00:04:05,226 --> 00:04:11,118
the same gift like unto him;

55
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:13,562
8 And if you do these

56
00:04:13,562 --> 00:04:16,006
last commandments of

57
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:18,45
mine, which I have

58
00:04:18,45 --> 00:04:20,894
given you, the gates of

59
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:23,338
hell shall not prevail

60
00:04:23,338 --> 00:04:25,782
against you; for my

61
00:04:25,782 --> 00:04:28,226
grace is sufficient for

62
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,67
you, and you shall be

63
00:04:30,67 --> 00:04:33,406
lifted up at the last day.

64
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:35,977
9 And I, Jesus

65
00:04:35,977 --> 00:04:38,548
Christ, your Lord and your

66
00:04:38,548 --> 00:04:41,119
God, have spoken it

67
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:43,69
unto you, that I might

68
00:04:43,69 --> 00:04:46,261
bring about my

69
00:04:46,261 --> 00:04:48,832
righteous purposes unto

70
00:04:48,832 --> 00:04:51,758
the children of men. Amen.
