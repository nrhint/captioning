00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:18,59
Section 17 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:18,59 --> 00:00:25,902
 the Prophet to Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and

3
00:00:25,902 --> 00:00:33,214
 Martin Harris, at Fayette, New York, June 1829,

4
00:00:33,214 --> 00:00:40,526
 prior to their viewing the engraved plates that

5
00:00:40,526 --> 00:00:47,838
 contained the Book of Mormon record. Joseph and his

6
00:00:47,838 --> 00:00:55,15
 scribe, Oliver Cowdery, had learned from the

7
00:00:55,15 --> 00:01:02,462
 translation of the Book of Mormon plates that three

8
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:09,774
 special witnesses would be designated (see 
Ether 5:2–4;

9
00:01:09,774 --> 00:01:17,086
2 Nephi 11:3; 
27:12). Oliver Cowdery, David

10
00:01:17,086 --> 00:01:24,398
 Whitmer, and Martin Harris were moved upon by an

11
00:01:24,398 --> 00:01:31,71
 inspired desire to be the three special witnesses. The

12
00:01:31,71 --> 00:01:39,022
 Prophet inquired of the Lord, and this revelation

13
00:01:39,022 --> 00:01:46,334
 was given in answer through the Urim and Thummim.

14
00:01:46,334 --> 00:01:53,646
1–4, By faith the Three Witnesses will see the

15
00:01:53,646 --> 00:02:00,958
 plates and other sacred items; 
5–9, Christ bears

16
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:08,27
 testimony of the divinity of the Book of Mormon.

17
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:16,329
1 Behold, I say unto you, that you must rely upon

18
00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:23,996
 my word, which if you do with full purpose of

19
00:02:23,996 --> 00:02:31,663
 heart, you shall have a view of the plates, and also

20
00:02:31,663 --> 00:02:39,33
 of the breastplate, the sword of Laban, the Urim

21
00:02:39,33 --> 00:02:46,997
 and Thummim, which were given to the brother of

22
00:02:46,997 --> 00:02:54,664
 Jared upon the mount, when he talked with the Lord

23
00:02:54,664 --> 00:03:02,331
 face to face, and the miraculous directors which were

24
00:03:02,331 --> 00:03:09,998
 given to Lehi while in the wilderness, on the

25
00:03:09,998 --> 00:03:17,665
 borders of the Red Sea

26
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:21,597
2 And it is by your faith that you shall obtain a

27
00:03:21,597 --> 00:03:25,93
 view of them, even by that faith which was had by

28
00:03:25,93 --> 00:03:30,263
 the prophets of old

29
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:36,11
3 And after that you have obtained faith, and have

30
00:03:36,11 --> 00:03:41,443
 seen them with your eyes, you shall testify of

31
00:03:41,443 --> 00:03:46,776
 them, by the power of God

32
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:52,509
4 And this you shall do that my servant Joseph

33
00:03:52,509 --> 00:03:58,759
 Smith, Jun., may not be destroyed, that I may bring

34
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:05,009
 about my righteous purposes unto the children of

35
00:04:05,009 --> 00:04:11,259
 men in this work

36
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:17,252
5 And ye shall testify that you have seen them,

37
00:04:17,252 --> 00:04:22,752
 even as my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., has seen

38
00:04:22,752 --> 00:04:28,252
 them; for it is by my power that he has seen them, and

39
00:04:28,252 --> 00:04:33,752
 it is because he had faith

40
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:40,574
6 And he has translated the book, even that part

41
00:04:40,574 --> 00:04:47,241
 which I have commanded him, and as your Lord and

42
00:04:47,241 --> 00:04:53,908
 your God liveth it is true

43
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:58,127
7 Wherefore, you have received the same power, and

44
00:04:58,127 --> 00:05:02,627
 the same faith, and the same gift like unto him

45
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:07,869
8 And if you do these last commandments of mine,

46
00:05:07,869 --> 00:05:13,069
 which I have given you, the gates of hell shall not

47
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:18,269
 prevail against you; for my grace is sufficient

48
00:05:18,269 --> 00:05:23,469
 for you, and you shall be lifted up at the last

49
00:05:23,469 --> 00:05:28,669
 day

50
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:33,411
9 And I, Jesus Christ, your Lord and your God,

51
00:05:33,411 --> 00:05:38,661
 have spoken it unto you, that I might bring about my

52
00:05:38,661 --> 00:05:43,911
 righteous purposes unto the children of men. Amen.

53
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:49,161
