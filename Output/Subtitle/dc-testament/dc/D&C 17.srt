00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 17 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Prophet to Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Martin Harris, at Fayette, New York, June 1829,

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
prior to their viewing the engraved plates that

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
contained the Book of Mormon record. Joseph and

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
his scribe, Oliver Cowdery, had learned from the

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
translation of the Book of Mormon plates that three

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
special witnesses would be designated (see

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Ether 5:2–4; 
2 Nephi 11:3; 
27:12). Oliver Cowdery,

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
David Whitmer, and Martin Harris were moved upon

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
by an inspired desire to be the three special

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
witnesses. The Prophet inquired of the Lord, and

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
this revelation was given in answer through the Urim

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
and Thummim. 
1–4, By faith the Three Witnesses

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
will see the plates and other sacred items; 
5–9,

16
00:00:00,0 --> 01:03:58,
Christ bears testimony of the divinity of the Book of Mormon. 

17
01:03:58,0 --> 01:03:58,0
1 Behold, I say unto you, that you must rely

18
01:03:58,0 --> 01:03:58,0
upon my word, which if you do with full purpose

19
01:03:58,0 --> 01:03:58,0
of heart, you shall have a view of the

20
01:03:58,0 --> 01:03:58,0
plates, and also of the breastplate, the sword of

21
01:03:58,0 --> 01:03:58,0
Laban, the Urim and Thummim, which were given to

22
01:03:58,0 --> 01:03:58,0
the brother of Jared upon the mount, when he

23
01:03:58,0 --> 01:03:58,0
talked with the Lord face to face, and the

24
01:03:58,0 --> 01:03:58,0
miraculous directors which were given to Lehi

25
01:03:58,0 --> 01:10:39,
while in the wilderness, on the borders of the Red Sea.

26
01:10:39,0 --> 01:10:39,0
2 And it is by your faith that you shall

27
01:10:39,0 --> 01:10:39,0
obtain a view of them, even by that

28
01:10:39,0 --> 01:14:52,
faith which was had by the prophets of old.

29
01:14:52,0 --> 01:14:52,0
3 And after that you have

30
01:14:52,0 --> 01:14:52,0
obtained faith, and have seen them

31
01:14:52,0 --> 01:14:52,0
with your eyes, you shall

32
01:14:52,0 --> 01:25:59,
testify of them, by the power of God;

33
01:25:59,0 --> 01:25:59,0
4 And this you shall do

34
01:25:59,0 --> 01:25:59,0
that my servant Joseph Smith,

35
01:25:59,0 --> 01:25:59,0
Jun., may not be destroyed,

36
01:25:59,0 --> 01:25:59,0
that I may bring about my

37
01:25:59,0 --> 01:25:59,0
righteous purposes unto the

38
01:25:59,0 --> 01:27:11,
children of men in this work.

39
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
5 And ye shall testify

40
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
that you have seen them,

41
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
even as my servant Joseph

42
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
Smith, Jun., has seen

43
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
them; for it is by my power

44
01:27:11,0 --> 01:27:11,0
that he has seen them, and

45
01:27:11,0 --> 01:34:19,
it is because he had faith.

46
01:34:19,0 --> 01:34:19,0
6 And he has translated

47
01:34:19,0 --> 01:34:19,0
the book, even that part

48
01:34:19,0 --> 01:34:19,0
which I have commanded

49
01:34:19,0 --> 01:34:19,0
him, and as your Lord and

50
01:34:19,0 --> 01:35:31,
your God liveth it is true.

51
01:35:31,0 --> 01:35:31,0
7 Wherefore, you have

52
01:35:31,0 --> 01:35:31,0
received the same power,

53
01:35:31,0 --> 01:35:31,0
and the same faith, and

54
01:35:31,0 --> 01:38:13,
the same gift like unto him;

55
01:38:13,0 --> 01:38:13,0
8 And if you do these

56
01:38:13,0 --> 01:38:13,0
last commandments of

57
01:38:13,0 --> 01:38:13,0
mine, which I have

58
01:38:13,0 --> 01:38:13,0
given you, the gates of

59
01:38:13,0 --> 01:38:13,0
hell shall not prevail

60
01:38:13,0 --> 01:38:13,0
against you; for my

61
01:38:13,0 --> 01:38:13,0
grace is sufficient for

62
01:38:13,0 --> 01:38:13,0
you, and you shall be

63
01:38:13,0 --> 01:44:54,
lifted up at the last day.

64
01:44:54,0 --> 01:44:54,0
9 And I, Jesus

65
01:44:54,0 --> 01:44:54,0
Christ, your Lord and your

66
01:44:54,0 --> 01:44:54,0
God, have spoken it

67
01:44:54,0 --> 01:44:54,0
unto you, that I might

68
01:44:54,0 --> 01:44:54,0
bring about my

69
01:44:54,0 --> 01:44:54,0
righteous purposes unto

70
01:44:54,0 --> 01:51:49,
the children of men. Amen.
