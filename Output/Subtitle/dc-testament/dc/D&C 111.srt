00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:18,334
Section 111 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:18,334 --> 00:00:25,39
 the Prophet, at Salem, Massachusetts, August 6,

3
00:00:25,39 --> 00:00:32,446
 1836. At this time the leaders of the Church were

4
00:00:32,446 --> 00:00:39,502
 heavily in debt due to their labors in the ministry.

5
00:00:39,502 --> 00:00:46,558
 Hearing that a large amount of money would be

6
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:53,614
 available to them in Salem, the Prophet, Sidney

7
00:00:53,614 --> 00:01:00,67
 Rigdon, Hyrum Smith, and Oliver Cowdery traveled there

8
00:01:00,67 --> 00:01:07,726
 from Kirtland, Ohio, to investigate this claim,

9
00:01:07,726 --> 00:01:14,782
 along with preaching the gospel. The brethren

10
00:01:14,782 --> 00:01:21,838
 transacted several items of Church business and did some

11
00:01:21,838 --> 00:01:28,894
 preaching. When it became apparent that no money

12
00:01:28,894 --> 00:01:35,95
 was to be forthcoming, they returned to Kirtland.

13
00:01:35,95 --> 00:01:43,006
 Several of the factors prominent in the background

14
00:01:43,006 --> 00:01:50,062
 are reflected in the wording of this revelation.

15
00:01:50,062 --> 00:01:57,118
1–5, The Lord looks to the temporal needs of His

16
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:04,174
 servants; 
6–11, He will deal mercifully with Zion

17
00:02:04,174 --> 00:02:11,23
 and arrange all things for the good of His

18
00:02:11,23 --> 00:02:18,286
 servants.

19
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:24,388
1 I, the Lord your God, am not displeased with

20
00:02:24,388 --> 00:02:30,388
 your coming this journey, notwithstanding your

21
00:02:30,388 --> 00:02:36,388
 follies

22
00:02:36,69 --> 00:02:43,69
2 I have much treasure in this city for you, for

23
00:02:43,69 --> 00:02:50,69
 the benefit of Zion, and many people in this city,

24
00:02:50,69 --> 00:02:57,69
 whom I will gather out in due time for the benefit

25
00:02:57,69 --> 00:03:04,69
 of Zion, through your instrumentality

26
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:09,784
3 Therefore, it is expedient that you should form

27
00:03:09,784 --> 00:03:15,117
 acquaintance with men in this city, as you shall

28
00:03:15,117 --> 00:03:20,45
 be led, and as it shall be given you

29
00:03:20,2 --> 00:03:25,2
4 And it shall come to pass in due time that I

30
00:03:25,2 --> 00:03:30,2
 will give this city into your hands, that you shall

31
00:03:30,2 --> 00:03:35,2
 have power over it, insomuch that they shall not

32
00:03:35,2 --> 00:03:40,2
 discover your secret parts; and its wealth

33
00:03:40,2 --> 00:03:45,2
 pertaining to gold and silver shall be yours

34
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:51,708
5 Concern not yourselves about your debts, for I

35
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:58,208
 will give you power to pay them

36
00:03:58,722 --> 00:04:05,222
6 Concern not yourselves about Zion, for I will

37
00:04:05,222 --> 00:04:11,722
 deal mercifully with her

38
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,751
7 Tarry in this place, and in the regions round

39
00:04:13,751 --> 00:04:16,251
 about

40
00:04:16,273 --> 00:04:23,273
8 And the place where it is my will that you

41
00:04:23,273 --> 00:04:30,273
 should tarry, for the main, shall be signalized unto

42
00:04:30,273 --> 00:04:37,273
 you by the peace and power of my Spirit, that shall

43
00:04:37,273 --> 00:04:44,273
 flow unto you

44
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:50,701
9 This place you may obtain by hire. And inquire

45
00:04:50,701 --> 00:04:57,368
 diligently concerning the more ancient inhabitants

46
00:04:57,368 --> 00:05:04,035
 and founders of this city

47
00:05:04,321 --> 00:05:09,321
10 For there are more treasures than one for you

48
00:05:09,321 --> 00:05:14,321
 in this city

49
00:05:14,631 --> 00:05:19,881
11 Therefore, be ye as wise as serpents and yet

50
00:05:19,881 --> 00:05:25,131
 without sin; and I will order all things for your

51
00:05:25,131 --> 00:05:30,381
 good, as fast as ye are able to receive them. Amen.

52
00:05:30,381 --> 00:05:35,631
