00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 111 Revelation given through Joseph

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Smith the Prophet, at Salem, Massachusetts, August

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
6, 1836. At this time the leaders of the

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Church were heavily in debt due to their labors in

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the ministry. Hearing that a large amount of

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
money would be available to them in Salem, the

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Prophet, Sidney Rigdon, Hyrum Smith, and Oliver

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Cowdery traveled there from Kirtland, Ohio, to

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
investigate this claim, along with preaching the

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
gospel. The brethren transacted several items

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
of Church business and did some preaching. When

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
it became apparent that no money was to be

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
forthcoming, they returned to Kirtland. Several of

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the factors prominent in the background are

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
reflected in the wording of this revelation. 
1–5,

16
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
The Lord looks to the temporal needs of His

17
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
servants; 
6–11, He will deal mercifully with

18
00:00:00,0 --> 02:16:47,
Zion and arrange all things for the good of His servants. 

19
02:16:47,0 --> 02:16:47,0
1 I, the Lord your God, am not

20
02:16:47,0 --> 02:16:47,0
displeased with your coming this

21
02:16:47,0 --> 02:16:25,
journey, notwithstanding your follies.

22
02:16:25,0 --> 02:16:25,0
2 I have much treasure in this

23
02:16:25,0 --> 02:16:25,0
city for you, for the benefit

24
02:16:25,0 --> 02:16:25,0
of Zion, and many people in this

25
02:16:25,0 --> 02:16:25,0
city, whom I will gather out

26
02:16:25,0 --> 02:16:25,0
in due time for the benefit of

27
02:16:25,0 --> 02:12:05,
Zion, through your instrumentality.

28
02:12:05,0 --> 02:12:05,0
3 Therefore, it is

29
02:12:05,0 --> 02:12:05,0
expedient that you should form

30
02:12:05,0 --> 02:12:05,0
acquaintance with men in this

31
02:12:05,0 --> 02:12:05,0
city, as you shall be led,

32
02:12:05,0 --> 02:17:10,
and as it shall be given you.

33
02:17:10,0 --> 02:17:10,0
4 And it shall come to

34
02:17:10,0 --> 02:17:10,0
pass in due time that I will

35
02:17:10,0 --> 02:17:10,0
give this city into your

36
02:17:10,0 --> 02:17:10,0
hands, that you shall have

37
02:17:10,0 --> 02:17:10,0
power over it, insomuch

38
02:17:10,0 --> 02:17:10,0
that they shall not discover

39
02:17:10,0 --> 02:17:10,0
your secret parts; and

40
02:17:10,0 --> 02:17:10,0
its wealth pertaining to

41
02:17:10,0 --> 02:18:14,
gold and silver shall be yours.

42
02:18:14,0 --> 02:18:14,0
5 Concern not

43
02:18:14,0 --> 02:18:14,0
yourselves about your

44
02:18:14,0 --> 02:18:14,0
debts, for I will give

45
02:18:14,0 --> 02:23:19,
you power to pay them.

46
02:23:19,0 --> 02:23:19,0
6 Concern not

47
02:23:19,0 --> 02:23:19,0
yourselves about Zion,

48
02:23:19,0 --> 02:23:19,0
for I will deal

49
02:23:19,0 --> 02:36:23,
mercifully with her.

50
02:36:23,0 --> 02:36:23,0
7 Tarry in this

51
02:36:23,0 --> 02:36:23,0
place, and in the

52
02:36:23,0 --> 03:07:23,
regions round about;

53
03:07:23,0 --> 03:07:23,0
8 And the place

54
03:07:23,0 --> 03:07:23,0
where it is my

55
03:07:23,0 --> 03:07:23,0
will that you

56
03:07:23,0 --> 03:07:23,0
should tarry, for

57
03:07:23,0 --> 03:07:23,0
the main, shall

58
03:07:23,0 --> 03:07:23,0
be signalized

59
03:07:23,0 --> 03:07:23,0
unto you by the

60
03:07:23,0 --> 03:07:23,0
peace and power of

61
03:07:23,0 --> 03:07:23,0
my Spirit, that

62
03:07:23,0 --> 03:09:27,
shall flow unto you.

63
03:09:27,0 --> 03:09:27,0
9 This place

64
03:09:27,0 --> 03:09:27,0
you may obtain by

65
03:09:27,0 --> 03:09:27,0
hire. And

66
03:09:27,0 --> 03:09:27,0
inquire diligently

67
03:09:27,0 --> 03:09:27,0
concerning the

68
03:09:27,0 --> 03:09:27,0
more ancient

69
03:09:27,0 --> 03:09:27,0
inhabitants and

70
03:09:27,0 --> 03:11:31,
founders of this city;

71
03:11:31,0 --> 03:11:31,0
10 For there

72
03:11:31,0 --> 03:11:31,0
are more

73
03:11:31,0 --> 03:11:31,0
treasures than

74
03:11:31,0 --> 03:11:31,0
one for you

75
03:11:31,0 --> 03:15:38,
in this city.

76
03:15:38,0 --> 03:15:38,0
11

77
03:15:38,0 --> 03:15:38,0
Therefore, be ye as

78
03:15:38,0 --> 03:15:38,0
wise as

79
03:15:38,0 --> 03:15:38,0
serpents and

80
03:15:38,0 --> 03:15:38,0
yet without

81
03:15:38,0 --> 03:15:38,0
sin; and I

82
03:15:38,0 --> 03:15:38,0
will order

83
03:15:38,0 --> 03:15:38,0

84
03:15:38,0 --> 03:15:38,0
for your

85
03:15:38,0 --> 03:15:38,0
good, as

86
03:15:38,0 --> 03:15:38,0
fast as ye are

87
03:15:38,0 --> 03:15:38,0
able to

88
03:15:38,0 --> 03:19:17,
receive them. Amen.
