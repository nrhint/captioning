00:00:06,9 --> 00:00:13,8
Smith the Prophet to John Whitmer, at Fayette,

3
00:00:13,8 --> 00:00:20,7
New York, June 1829 (see the 
heading to

4
00:00:20,7 --> 00:00:27,6
section 14). The message is intimately and

5
00:00:27,6 --> 00:00:34,5
impressively personal in that the Lord tells of what was

6
00:00:34,5 --> 00:00:41,4
known only to John Whitmer and Himself. John

7
00:00:41,4 --> 00:00:48,3
Whitmer later became one of the Eight

8
00:00:48,3 --> 00:00:55,2
Witnesses to the Book of Mormon.

10
00:01:02,1 --> 00:01:09,169
gospel and save souls is the thing of most worth. 

11
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:11,502
1 Hearken, my servant John, and

12
00:01:11,502 --> 00:01:13,835
listen to the words of Jesus

13
00:01:13,835 --> 00:01:16,677
Christ, your Lord and your Redeemer.

14
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:20,677
2 For behold, I speak

15
00:01:20,677 --> 00:01:24,677
unto you with sharpness

16
00:01:24,677 --> 00:01:28,677
and with power, for mine

17
00:01:28,677 --> 00:01:32,159
arm is over all the earth.

18
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,826
3 And I will tell you

19
00:01:36,826 --> 00:01:41,493
that which no man

20
00:01:41,493 --> 00:01:46,473
knoweth save me and thee alone—

21
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:48,473
4 For many times

22
00:01:48,473 --> 00:01:50,473
you have desired of

23
00:01:50,473 --> 00:01:52,473
me to know that

24
00:01:52,473 --> 00:01:54,473
which would be of the

25
00:01:54,473 --> 00:01:56,85
most worth unto you.

26
00:01:56,85 --> 00:01:58,707
5 Behold, blessed

27
00:01:58,707 --> 00:02:00,564
are you for this

28
00:02:00,564 --> 00:02:02,421
thing, and for

29
00:02:02,421 --> 00:02:04,278

6 And now,

34
00:02:10,3 --> 00:02:11,371

35
00:02:11,371 --> 00:02:12,442

00:02:13,513 --> 00:02:14,584
of the most

38
00:02:14,584 --> 00:02:15,655
worth unto you will

39
00:02:15,655 --> 00:02:16,726
be to declare

40
00:02:16,726 --> 00:02:17,797
repentance unto

41
00:02:17,797 --> 00:02:18,868
this people, that

42
00:02:18,868 --> 00:02:19,939
you may bring

00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:21,01
souls unto me,

44

46
00:02:23,152 --> 00:02:24,711
kingdom of my Father. Amen.
