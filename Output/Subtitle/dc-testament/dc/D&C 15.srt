00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:18,111
Section 15 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:18,111 --> 00:00:24,712
 the Prophet to John Whitmer, at Fayette, New York,

3
00:00:24,712 --> 00:00:31,311
 June 1829 (see the 
heading to section 14). The

4
00:00:31,311 --> 00:00:37,911
 message is intimately and impressively personal in

5
00:00:37,911 --> 00:00:44,511
 that the Lord tells of what was known only to John

6
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:51,111
 Whitmer and Himself. John Whitmer later became one

7
00:00:51,111 --> 00:00:57,711
 of the Eight Witnesses to the Book of Mormon.

8
00:00:57,711 --> 00:01:04,311
1–2, The Lord’s arm is over all the earth; 
3–6, To

9
00:01:04,311 --> 00:01:10,912
 preach the gospel and save souls is the thing of

10
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:17,511
 most worth.

11
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:24,811
1 Hearken, my servant John, and listen to the

12
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:32,311
 words of Jesus Christ, your Lord and your Redeemer

13
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:39,559
2 For behold, I speak unto you with sharpness and

14
00:01:39,559 --> 00:01:46,559
 with power, for mine arm is over all the earth

15
00:01:46,84 --> 00:01:52,84
3 And I will tell you that which no man knoweth

16
00:01:52,84 --> 00:01:58,84
 save me and thee alone

17
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:04,819
4 For many times you have desired of me to know

18
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:10,819
 that which would be of the most worth unto you

19
00:02:10,13 --> 00:02:15,13
5 Behold, blessed are you for this thing, and for

20
00:02:15,13 --> 00:02:20,13
 speaking my words which I have given you according

21
00:02:20,13 --> 00:02:25,13
 to my commandments

22
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:30,712
6 And now, behold, I say unto you, that the thing

23
00:02:30,712 --> 00:02:36,312
 which will be of the most worth unto you will be

24
00:02:36,312 --> 00:02:41,912
 to declare repentance unto this people, that you

25
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:47,512
 may bring souls unto me, that you may rest with them

26
00:02:47,512 --> 00:02:53,112
 in the kingdom of my Father. Amen.
