00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:24,758
Section 133 Revelation given through Joseph Smith

2
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:30,998
 the Prophet, at Hiram, Ohio, November 3, 1831.

3
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:37,239
 Prefacing this revelation, Joseph Smith’s history

4
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:43,478
 states, “At this time there were many things which

5
00:00:43,478 --> 00:00:49,719
 the Elders desired to know relative to preaching the

6
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:55,959
 Gospel to the inhabitants of the earth, and

7
00:00:55,959 --> 00:01:02,198
 concerning the gathering; and in order to walk by the

8
00:01:02,198 --> 00:01:08,439
 true light, and be instructed from on high, on the

9
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:14,678
 3rd of November, 1831, I inquired of the Lord and

10
00:01:14,678 --> 00:01:20,919
 received the following important revelation.” This

11
00:01:20,919 --> 00:01:27,159
 section was first added to the book of Doctrine

12
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:33,398
 and Covenants as an appendix and was subsequently

13
00:01:33,398 --> 00:01:39,639
 assigned a section number. 
1–6, The Saints are

14
00:01:39,639 --> 00:01:45,879
 commanded to prepare for the Second Coming; 
7–16,

15
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:52,119
 All men are commanded to flee from Babylon, come to

16
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:58,359
 Zion, and prepare for the great day of the Lord;

17
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:04,599
17–35, He will stand on Mount Zion, the continents

18
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:10,839
 will become one land, and the lost tribes of

19
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:17,078
 Israel will return; 
36–40, The gospel was restored

20
00:02:17,078 --> 00:02:23,319
 through Joseph Smith to be preached in all the

21
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:29,558
 world; 
41–51, The Lord will come down in vengeance

22
00:02:29,558 --> 00:02:35,798
 upon the wicked; 
52–56, It will be the year of His

23
00:02:35,798 --> 00:02:42,038
 redeemed; 
57–74, The gospel is to be sent forth to

24
00:02:42,038 --> 00:02:48,278
 save the Saints and for the destruction of the

25
00:02:48,278 --> 00:02:54,518
 wicked.

26
00:02:54,825 --> 00:02:59,158
1 Hearken, O ye people of my church, saith the

27
00:02:59,158 --> 00:03:03,491
 Lord your God, and hear the word of the Lord

28
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:07,824
 concerning you

29
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:12,854
2 The Lord who shall suddenly come to his temple;

30
00:03:12,854 --> 00:03:18,104
 the Lord who shall come down upon the world with a

31
00:03:18,104 --> 00:03:23,354
 curse to judgment; yea, upon all the nations that

32
00:03:23,354 --> 00:03:28,604
 forget God, and upon all the ungodly among you

33
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:35,975
3 For he shall make bare his holy arm in the eyes

34
00:03:35,975 --> 00:03:43,308
 of all the nations, and all the ends of the earth

35
00:03:43,308 --> 00:03:50,641
 shall see the salvation of their God

36
00:03:50,63 --> 00:03:56,63
4 Wherefore, prepare ye, prepare ye, O my people;

37
00:03:56,63 --> 00:04:02,63
 sanctify yourselves; gather ye together, O ye

38
00:04:02,63 --> 00:04:08,63
 people of my church, upon the land of Zion, all you

39
00:04:08,63 --> 00:04:14,63
 that have not been commanded to tarry

40
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:22,154
5 Go ye out from Babylon. Be ye clean that bear

41
00:04:22,154 --> 00:04:29,654
 the vessels of the Lord

42
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:36,603
6 Call your solemn assemblies, and speak often one

43
00:04:36,603 --> 00:04:43,27
 to another. And let every man call upon the name

44
00:04:43,27 --> 00:04:49,937
 of the Lord

45
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:54,689
7 Yea, verily I say unto you again, the time has

46
00:04:54,689 --> 00:04:59,689
 come when the voice of the Lord is unto you: Go ye

47
00:04:59,689 --> 00:05:04,689
 out of Babylon; gather ye out from among the

48
00:05:04,689 --> 00:05:09,689
 nations, from the four winds, from one end of heaven to

49
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:14,689
 the other

50
00:05:14,965 --> 00:05:22,965
8 Send forth the elders of my church unto the

51
00:05:22,965 --> 00:05:30,965
 nations which are afar off; unto the islands of the

52
00:05:30,965 --> 00:05:38,965
 sea; send forth unto foreign lands; call upon all

53
00:05:38,965 --> 00:05:46,965
 nations, first upon the Gentiles, and then upon the

54
00:05:46,965 --> 00:05:54,965
 Jews

55
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:58,387
9 And behold, and lo, this shall be their cry, and

56
00:05:58,387 --> 00:06:02,387
 the voice of the Lord unto all people: Go ye

57
00:06:02,387 --> 00:06:06,387
 forth unto the land of Zion, that the borders of my

58
00:06:06,387 --> 00:06:10,387
 people may be enlarged, and that her stakes may be

59
00:06:10,387 --> 00:06:14,387
 strengthened, and that Zion may go forth unto the

60
00:06:14,387 --> 00:06:18,387
 regions round about

61
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:24,528
10 Yea, let the cry go forth among all people:

62
00:06:24,528 --> 00:06:30,928
 Awake and arise and go forth to meet the Bridegroom;

63
00:06:30,928 --> 00:06:37,328
 behold and lo, the Bridegroom cometh; go ye out to

64
00:06:37,328 --> 00:06:43,728
 meet him. Prepare yourselves for the great day of

65
00:06:43,728 --> 00:06:50,128
 the Lord

66
00:06:50,093 --> 00:06:53,593
11 Watch, therefore, for ye know neither the day

67
00:06:53,593 --> 00:06:57,093
 nor the hour

68
00:06:57,617 --> 00:07:02,117
12 Let them, therefore, who are among the Gentiles

69
00:07:02,117 --> 00:07:06,617
 flee unto Zion

70
00:07:06,643 --> 00:07:12,143
13 And let them who be of Judah flee unto

71
00:07:12,143 --> 00:07:17,643
 Jerusalem, unto the mountains of the Lord’s house

72
00:07:17,921 --> 00:07:22,921
14 Go ye out from among the nations, even from

73
00:07:22,921 --> 00:07:27,921
 Babylon, from the midst of wickedness, which is

74
00:07:27,921 --> 00:07:32,921
 spiritual Babylon

75
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:39,669
15 But verily, thus saith the Lord, let not your

76
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:46,419
 flight be in haste, but let all things be prepared

77
00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:53,169
 before you; and he that goeth, let him not look

78
00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:59,919
 back lest sudden destruction shall come upon him

79
00:07:59,462 --> 00:08:04,262
16 Hearken and hear, O ye inhabitants of the

80
00:08:04,262 --> 00:08:09,062
 earth. Listen, ye elders of my church together, and

81
00:08:09,062 --> 00:08:13,862
 hear the voice of the Lord; for he calleth upon all

82
00:08:13,862 --> 00:08:18,662
 men, and he commandeth all men everywhere to

83
00:08:18,662 --> 00:08:23,462
 repent

84
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:30,186
17 For behold, the Lord God hath sent forth the

85
00:08:30,186 --> 00:08:36,936
 angel crying through the midst of heaven, saying:

86
00:08:36,936 --> 00:08:43,686
 Prepare ye the way of the Lord, and make his paths

87
00:08:43,686 --> 00:08:50,436
 straight, for the hour of his coming is nigh

88
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:57,463
18 When the Lamb shall stand upon Mount Zion, and

89
00:08:57,463 --> 00:09:04,463
 with him a hundred and forty-four thousand, having

90
00:09:04,463 --> 00:09:11,463
 his Father’s name written on their foreheads

91
00:09:11,0 --> 00:09:16,0
19 Wherefore, prepare ye for the coming of the

92
00:09:16,0 --> 00:09:21,0
 Bridegroom; go ye, go ye out to meet him

93
00:09:21,544 --> 00:09:26,794
20 For behold, he shall stand upon the mount of

94
00:09:26,794 --> 00:09:32,044
 Olivet, and upon the mighty ocean, even the great

95
00:09:32,044 --> 00:09:37,294
 deep, and upon the islands of the sea, and upon the

96
00:09:37,294 --> 00:09:42,544
 land of Zion

97
00:09:42,065 --> 00:09:46,398
21 And he shall utter his voice out of Zion, and

98
00:09:46,398 --> 00:09:50,731
 he shall speak from Jerusalem, and his voice shall

99
00:09:50,731 --> 00:09:55,064
 be heard among all people

100
00:09:55,078 --> 00:10:00,828
22 And it shall be a voice as the voice of many

101
00:10:00,828 --> 00:10:06,578
 waters, and as the voice of a great thunder, which

102
00:10:06,578 --> 00:10:12,328
 shall break down the mountains, and the valleys

103
00:10:12,328 --> 00:10:18,078
 shall not be found

104
00:10:18,067 --> 00:10:23,4
23 He shall command the great deep, and it shall

105
00:10:23,4 --> 00:10:28,733
 be driven back into the north countries, and the

106
00:10:28,733 --> 00:10:34,066
 islands shall become one land

107
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:39,867
24 And the land of Jerusalem and the land of Zion

108
00:10:39,867 --> 00:10:45,367
 shall be turned back into their own place, and the

109
00:10:45,367 --> 00:10:50,867
 earth shall be like as it was in the days before

110
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:56,367
 it was divided

111
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,455
25 And the Lord, even the Savior, shall stand in

112
00:10:58,455 --> 00:11:00,788
 the midst of his people, and shall reign over all

113
00:11:00,788 --> 00:11:03,121
 flesh

114
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:09,596
26 And they who are in the north countries shall

115
00:11:09,596 --> 00:11:15,796
 come in remembrance before the Lord; and their

116
00:11:15,796 --> 00:11:21,996
 prophets shall hear his voice, and shall no longer

117
00:11:21,996 --> 00:11:28,196
 stay themselves; and they shall smite the rocks, and

118
00:11:28,196 --> 00:11:34,396
 the ice shall flow down at their presence

119
00:11:34,177 --> 00:11:37,177
27 And an highway shall be cast up in the midst of

120
00:11:37,177 --> 00:11:40,177
 the great deep

121
00:11:40,95 --> 00:11:49,95
28 Their enemies shall become a prey unto them

122
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:56,509
29 And in the barren deserts there shall come

123
00:11:56,509 --> 00:12:03,509
 forth pools of living water; and the parched ground

124
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:10,509
 shall no longer be a thirsty land

125
00:12:10,78 --> 00:12:18,28
30 And they shall bring forth their rich treasures

126
00:12:18,28 --> 00:12:25,78
 unto the children of Ephraim, my servants

127
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:30,778
31 And the boundaries of the everlasting hills

128
00:12:30,778 --> 00:12:35,778
 shall tremble at their presence

129
00:12:35,571 --> 00:12:43,238
32 And there shall they fall down and be crowned

130
00:12:43,238 --> 00:12:50,905
 with glory, even in Zion, by the hands of the

131
00:12:50,905 --> 00:12:58,572
 servants of the Lord, even the children of Ephraim

132
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:02,861
33 And they shall be filled with songs of

133
00:13:02,861 --> 00:13:06,861
 everlasting joy

134
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:14,619
34 Behold, this is the blessing of the everlasting

135
00:13:14,619 --> 00:13:22,619
 God upon the tribes of Israel, and the richer

136
00:13:22,619 --> 00:13:30,619
 blessing upon the head of Ephraim and his fellows

137
00:13:30,927 --> 00:13:37,177
35 And they also of the tribe of Judah, after

138
00:13:37,177 --> 00:13:43,427
 their pain, shall be sanctified in holiness before the

139
00:13:43,427 --> 00:13:49,677
 Lord, to dwell in his presence day and night,

140
00:13:49,677 --> 00:13:55,927
 forever and ever

141
00:13:55,218 --> 00:14:00,647
36 And now, verily saith the Lord, that these

142
00:14:00,647 --> 00:14:06,076
 things might be known among you, O inhabitants of the

143
00:14:06,076 --> 00:14:11,505
 earth, I have sent forth mine angel flying through

144
00:14:11,505 --> 00:14:16,934
 the midst of heaven, having the everlasting

145
00:14:16,934 --> 00:14:22,363
 gospel, who hath appeared unto some and hath committed

146
00:14:22,363 --> 00:14:27,792
 it unto man, who shall appear unto many that dwell

147
00:14:27,792 --> 00:14:33,221
 on the earth

148
00:14:33,489 --> 00:14:39,989
37 And this gospel shall be preached unto every

149
00:14:39,989 --> 00:14:46,489
 nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people

150
00:14:46,502 --> 00:14:51,835
38 And the servants of God shall go forth, saying

151
00:14:51,835 --> 00:14:57,168
 with a loud voice: Fear God and give glory to him,

152
00:14:57,168 --> 00:15:02,501
 for the hour of his judgment is come

153
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:08,001
39 And worship him that made heaven, and earth,

154
00:15:08,001 --> 00:15:14,001
 and the sea, and the fountains of waters

155
00:15:14,53 --> 00:15:21,03
40 Calling upon the name of the Lord day and

156
00:15:21,03 --> 00:15:27,53
 night, saying: O that thou wouldst rend the heavens,

157
00:15:27,53 --> 00:15:34,03
 that thou wouldst come down, that the mountains

158
00:15:34,03 --> 00:15:40,53
 might flow down at thy presence

159
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:44,523
41 And it shall be answered upon their heads; for

160
00:15:44,523 --> 00:15:48,523
 the presence of the Lord shall be as the melting

161
00:15:48,523 --> 00:15:52,523
 fire that burneth, and as the fire which causeth

162
00:15:52,523 --> 00:15:56,523
 the waters to boil

163
00:15:56,823 --> 00:16:02,156
42 O Lord, thou shalt come down to make thy name

164
00:16:02,156 --> 00:16:07,489
 known to thine adversaries, and all nations shall

165
00:16:07,489 --> 00:16:12,822
 tremble at thy presence

166
00:16:12,321 --> 00:16:16,321
43 When thou doest terrible things, things they

167
00:16:16,321 --> 00:16:20,321
 look not for

168
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:25,129
44 Yea, when thou comest down, and the mountains

169
00:16:25,129 --> 00:16:29,879
 flow down at thy presence, thou shalt meet him who

170
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:34,629
 rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, who

171
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:39,379
 remembereth thee in thy ways

172
00:16:39,148 --> 00:16:45,898
45 For since the beginning of the world have not

173
00:16:45,898 --> 00:16:52,648
 men heard nor perceived by the ear, neither hath

174
00:16:52,648 --> 00:16:59,398
 any eye seen, O God, besides thee, how great things

175
00:16:59,398 --> 00:17:06,148
 thou hast prepared for him that waiteth for thee

176
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:13,693
46 And it shall be said: Who is this that cometh

177
00:17:13,693 --> 00:17:20,493
 down from God in heaven with dyed garments; yea,

178
00:17:20,493 --> 00:17:27,293
 from the regions which are not known, clothed in his

179
00:17:27,293 --> 00:17:34,093
 glorious apparel, traveling in the greatness of

180
00:17:34,093 --> 00:17:40,893
 his strength

181
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:49,159
47 And he shall say: I am he who spake in

182
00:17:49,159 --> 00:17:58,159
 righteousness, mighty to save

183
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:05,011
48 And the Lord shall be red in his apparel, and

184
00:18:05,011 --> 00:18:11,344
 his garments like him that treadeth in the

185
00:18:11,344 --> 00:18:17,677
 wine-vat

186
00:18:17,68 --> 00:18:22,68
49 And so great shall be the glory of his presence

187
00:18:22,68 --> 00:18:27,68
 that the sun shall hide his face in shame, and

188
00:18:27,68 --> 00:18:32,68
 the moon shall withhold its light, and the stars

189
00:18:32,68 --> 00:18:37,68
 shall be hurled from their places

190
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:44,3
50 And his voice shall be heard: I have trodden

191
00:18:44,3 --> 00:18:50,633
 the wine-press alone, and have brought judgment upon

192
00:18:50,633 --> 00:18:56,966
 all people; and none were with me

193
00:18:56,736 --> 00:19:00,736
51 And I have trampled them in my fury, and I did

194
00:19:00,736 --> 00:19:04,736
 tread upon them in mine anger, and their blood

195
00:19:04,736 --> 00:19:08,736
 have I sprinkled upon my garments, and stained all my

196
00:19:08,736 --> 00:19:12,736
 raiment; for this was the day of vengeance which

197
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:16,736
 was in my heart

198
00:19:16,005 --> 00:19:23,605
52 And now the year of my redeemed is come; and

199
00:19:23,605 --> 00:19:31,205
 they shall mention the loving kindness of their

200
00:19:31,205 --> 00:19:38,805
 Lord, and all that he has bestowed upon them according

201
00:19:38,805 --> 00:19:46,405
 to his goodness, and according to his loving

202
00:19:46,405 --> 00:19:54,005
 kindness, forever and ever

203
00:19:54,009 --> 00:20:00,759
53 In all their afflictions he was afflicted. And

204
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:07,509
 the angel of his presence saved them; and in his

205
00:20:07,509 --> 00:20:14,259
 love, and in his pity, he redeemed them, and bore

206
00:20:14,259 --> 00:20:21,009
 them, and carried them all the days of old

207
00:20:21,27 --> 00:20:25,02
54 Yea, and Enoch also, and they who were with

208
00:20:25,02 --> 00:20:28,77
 him; the prophets who were before him; and Noah also,

209
00:20:28,77 --> 00:20:32,52
 and they who were before him; and Moses also, and

210
00:20:32,52 --> 00:20:36,27
 they who were before him

211
00:20:36,552 --> 00:20:43,802
55 And from Moses to Elijah, and from Elijah to

212
00:20:43,802 --> 00:20:51,052
 John, who were with Christ in his resurrection, and

213
00:20:51,052 --> 00:20:58,302
 the holy apostles, with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,

214
00:20:58,302 --> 00:21:05,552
 shall be in the presence of the Lamb

215
00:21:05,548 --> 00:21:11,881
56 And the graves of the saints shall be opened;

216
00:21:11,881 --> 00:21:18,214
 and they shall come forth and stand on the right

217
00:21:18,214 --> 00:21:24,547
 hand of the Lamb, when he shall stand upon Mount

218
00:21:24,547 --> 00:21:30,88
 Zion, and upon the holy city, the New Jerusalem; and

219
00:21:30,88 --> 00:21:37,213
 they shall sing the song of the Lamb, day and

220
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:43,546
 night forever and ever

221
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:48,536
57 And for this cause, that men might be made

222
00:21:48,536 --> 00:21:53,536
 partakers of the glories which were to be revealed,

223
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:58,536
 the Lord sent forth the fulness of his gospel, his

224
00:21:58,536 --> 00:22:03,536
 everlasting covenant, reasoning in plainness and

225
00:22:03,536 --> 00:22:08,536
 simplicity

226
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:18,277
58 To prepare the weak for those things which are

227
00:22:18,277 --> 00:22:28,477
 coming on the earth, and for the Lord’s errand in

228
00:22:28,477 --> 00:22:38,677
 the day when the weak shall confound the wise, and

229
00:22:38,677 --> 00:22:48,877
 the little one become a strong nation, and two

230
00:22:48,877 --> 00:22:59,077
 shall put their tens of thousands to flight

231
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:06,212
59 And by the weak things of the earth the Lord

232
00:23:06,212 --> 00:23:12,879
 shall thresh the nations by the power of his Spirit

233
00:23:12,879 --> 00:23:19,546


234
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:26,531
60 And for this cause these commandments were

235
00:23:26,531 --> 00:23:33,531
 given; they were commanded to be kept from the world

236
00:23:33,531 --> 00:23:40,531
 in the day that they were given, but now are to go

237
00:23:40,531 --> 00:23:47,531
 forth unto all flesh

238
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:54,509
61 And this according to the mind and will of the

239
00:23:54,509 --> 00:24:01,509
 Lord, who ruleth over all flesh

240
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:07,273
62 And unto him that repenteth and sanctifieth

241
00:24:07,273 --> 00:24:13,273
 himself before the Lord shall be given eternal life

242
00:24:13,268 --> 00:24:18,268
63 And upon them that hearken not to the voice of

243
00:24:18,268 --> 00:24:23,268
 the Lord shall be fulfilled that which was written

244
00:24:23,268 --> 00:24:28,268
 by the prophet Moses, that they should be cut off

245
00:24:28,268 --> 00:24:33,268
 from among the people

246
00:24:33,789 --> 00:24:46,36
64 And also that which was written by the prophet

247
00:24:46,36 --> 00:24:58,931
 Malachi: For, behold, the day cometh that shall

248
00:24:58,931 --> 00:25:11,502
 burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all

249
00:25:11,502 --> 00:25:24,073
 that do wickedly, shall be stubble; and the day that

250
00:25:24,073 --> 00:25:36,644
 cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of

251
00:25:36,644 --> 00:25:49,215
 hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor

252
00:25:49,215 --> 00:26:01,786
 branch

253
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:05,693
65 Wherefore, this shall be the answer of the Lord

254
00:26:05,693 --> 00:26:09,693
 unto them

255
00:26:09,685 --> 00:26:13,685
66 In that day when I came unto mine own, no man

256
00:26:13,685 --> 00:26:17,685
 among you received me, and you were driven out

257
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:20,343
67 When I called again there was none of you to

258
00:26:20,343 --> 00:26:23,01
 answer; yet my arm was not shortened at all that I

259
00:26:23,01 --> 00:26:25,677
 could not redeem, neither my power to deliver

260
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:28,334
68 Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea. I make

261
00:26:28,334 --> 00:26:31,001
 the rivers a wilderness; their fish stink, and die

262
00:26:31,001 --> 00:26:33,668
 for thirst

263
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:37,659
69 I clothe the heavens with blackness, and make

264
00:26:37,659 --> 00:26:41,659
 sackcloth their covering

265
00:26:41,65 --> 00:26:41,65
70 And this shall ye have of my hand—ye shall lie

266
00:26:41,65 --> 00:26:41,65
 down in sorrow

267
00:26:41,984 --> 00:26:42,984
71 Behold, and lo, there are none to deliver you;

268
00:26:42,984 --> 00:26:43,984
 for ye obeyed not my voice when I called to you

269
00:26:43,984 --> 00:26:44,984
 out of the heavens; ye believed not my servants, and

270
00:26:44,984 --> 00:26:45,984
 when they were sent unto you ye received them

271
00:26:45,984 --> 00:26:46,984
 not

272
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:50,522
72 Wherefore, they sealed up the testimony and

273
00:26:50,522 --> 00:26:54,522
 bound up the law, and ye were delivered over unto

274
00:26:54,522 --> 00:26:58,522
 darkness

275
00:26:58,3 --> 00:27:01,633
73 These shall go away into outer darkness, where

276
00:27:01,633 --> 00:27:04,966
 there is weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of

277
00:27:04,966 --> 00:27:08,299
 teeth

278
00:27:08,594 --> 00:27:12,594
74 Behold the Lord your God hath spoken it. Amen.

279
00:27:12,594 --> 00:27:16,594
