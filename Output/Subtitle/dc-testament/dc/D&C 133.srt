00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Section 133 Revelation given through Joseph

2
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Smith the Prophet, at Hiram, Ohio, November 3, 1831.

3
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Prefacing this revelation, Joseph Smith’s

4
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
history states, “At this time there were many things

5
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
which the Elders desired to know relative to

6
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
preaching the Gospel to the inhabitants of the

7
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
earth, and concerning the gathering; and in order to

8
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
walk by the true light, and be instructed from

9
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
on high, on the 3rd of November, 1831, I

10
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
inquired of the Lord and received the following

11
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
important revelation.” This section was first added to

12
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the book of Doctrine and Covenants as an

13
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
appendix and was subsequently assigned a section

14
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
number. 
1–6, The Saints are commanded to prepare for

15
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
the Second Coming; 
7–16, All men are commanded

16
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
to flee from Babylon, come to Zion, and prepare

17
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
for the great day of the Lord; 
17–35, He will

18
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
stand on Mount Zion, the continents will become

19
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
one land, and the lost tribes of Israel will

20
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
return; 
36–40, The gospel was restored through

21
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
Joseph Smith to be preached in all the world;

22
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
41–51, The Lord will come down in vengeance upon the

23
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
wicked; 
52–56, It will be the year of His

24
00:00:00,0 --> 00:00:00,0
redeemed; 
57–74, The gospel is to be sent forth to

25
00:00:00,0 --> 02:53:44,
save the Saints and for the destruction of the wicked. 

26
02:53:44,0 --> 02:53:44,0
1 Hearken, O ye people of my

27
02:53:44,0 --> 02:53:44,0
church, saith the Lord your God, and hear

28
02:53:44,0 --> 03:06:48,
the word of the Lord concerning you—

29
03:06:48,0 --> 03:06:48,0
2 The Lord who shall suddenly

30
03:06:48,0 --> 03:06:48,0
come to his temple; the Lord who

31
03:06:48,0 --> 03:06:48,0
shall come down upon the world with

32
03:06:48,0 --> 03:06:48,0
a curse to judgment; yea, upon

33
03:06:48,0 --> 03:06:48,0
all the nations that forget God,

34
03:06:48,0 --> 03:27:51,
and upon all the ungodly among you.

35
03:27:51,0 --> 03:27:51,0
3 For he shall make bare

36
03:27:51,0 --> 03:27:51,0
his holy arm in the eyes of

37
03:27:51,0 --> 03:27:51,0
all the nations, and all the

38
03:27:51,0 --> 03:27:51,0
ends of the earth shall

39
03:27:51,0 --> 03:46:50,
see the salvation of their God.

40
03:46:50,0 --> 03:46:50,0
4 Wherefore, prepare ye,

41
03:46:50,0 --> 03:46:50,0
prepare ye, O my people;

42
03:46:50,0 --> 03:46:50,0
sanctify yourselves; gather

43
03:46:50,0 --> 03:46:50,0
ye together, O ye people

44
03:46:50,0 --> 03:46:50,0
of my church, upon the land

45
03:46:50,0 --> 03:46:50,0
of Zion, all you that

46
03:46:50,0 --> 03:49:52,
have not been commanded to tarry.

47
03:49:52,0 --> 03:49:52,0
5 Go ye out from

48
03:49:52,0 --> 03:49:52,0
Babylon. Be ye clean that bear

49
03:49:52,0 --> 04:12:52,
the vessels of the Lord.

50
04:12:52,0 --> 04:12:52,0
6 Call your solemn

51
04:12:52,0 --> 04:12:52,0
assemblies, and speak

52
04:12:52,0 --> 04:12:52,0
often one to another. And

53
04:12:52,0 --> 04:12:52,0
let every man call

54
04:12:52,0 --> 04:27:54,
upon the name of the Lord.

55
04:27:54,0 --> 04:27:54,0
7 Yea, verily I say

56
04:27:54,0 --> 04:27:54,0
unto you again, the

57
04:27:54,0 --> 04:27:54,0
time has come when the

58
04:27:54,0 --> 04:27:54,0
voice of the Lord is

59
04:27:54,0 --> 04:27:54,0
unto you: Go ye out

60
04:27:54,0 --> 04:27:54,0
of Babylon; gather ye

61
04:27:54,0 --> 04:27:54,0
out from among the

62
04:27:54,0 --> 04:27:54,0
nations, from the four

63
04:27:54,0 --> 04:27:54,0
winds, from one end

64
04:27:54,0 --> 04:26:58,
of heaven to the other.

65
04:26:58,0 --> 04:26:58,0
8 Send forth the

66
04:26:58,0 --> 04:26:58,0
elders of my church

67
04:26:58,0 --> 04:26:58,0
unto the nations which

68
04:26:58,0 --> 04:26:58,0
are afar off; unto

69
04:26:58,0 --> 04:26:58,0
the islands of the

70
04:26:58,0 --> 04:26:58,0
sea; send forth unto

71
04:26:58,0 --> 04:26:58,0
foreign lands; call

72
04:26:58,0 --> 04:26:58,0
upon all nations,

73
04:26:58,0 --> 04:26:58,0
first upon the

74
04:26:58,0 --> 04:29:02,
Gentiles, and then upon the Jews.

75
04:29:02,0 --> 04:29:02,0
9 And behold, and

76
04:29:02,0 --> 04:29:02,0
lo, this shall be

77
04:29:02,0 --> 04:29:02,0
their cry, and the

78
04:29:02,0 --> 04:29:02,0
voice of the Lord

79
04:29:02,0 --> 04:29:02,0
unto all people: Go ye

80
04:29:02,0 --> 04:29:02,0
forth unto the

81
04:29:02,0 --> 04:29:02,0
land of Zion, that the

82
04:29:02,0 --> 04:29:02,0
borders of my

83
04:29:02,0 --> 04:29:02,0
people may be enlarged,

84
04:29:02,0 --> 04:29:02,0
and that her

85
04:29:02,0 --> 04:29:02,0
stakes may be

86
04:29:02,0 --> 04:29:02,0
strengthened, and that Zion

87
04:29:02,0 --> 04:29:02,0
may go forth unto

88
04:29:02,0 --> 04:48:39,
the regions round about.

89
04:48:39,0 --> 04:48:39,0
10 Yea, let the

90
04:48:39,0 --> 04:48:39,0
cry go forth among

91
04:48:39,0 --> 04:48:39,0
all people:

92
04:48:39,0 --> 04:48:39,0
Awake and arise and

93
04:48:39,0 --> 04:48:39,0
go forth to meet

94
04:48:39,0 --> 04:48:39,0
the Bridegroom;

95
04:48:39,0 --> 04:48:39,0
behold and lo, the

96
04:48:39,0 --> 04:48:39,0
Bridegroom

97
04:48:39,0 --> 04:48:39,0
cometh; go ye out to

98
04:48:39,0 --> 04:48:39,0
meet him. Prepare

99
04:48:39,0 --> 04:48:39,0
yourselves for the

100
04:48:39,0 --> 05:13:40,
great day of the Lord.

101
05:13:40,0 --> 05:13:40,0
11 Watch,

102
05:13:40,0 --> 05:13:40,0
therefore, for ye

103
05:13:40,0 --> 05:13:40,0
know neither the

104
05:13:40,0 --> 05:42:42,
day nor the hour.

105
05:42:42,0 --> 05:42:42,0
12 Let them,

106
05:42:42,0 --> 05:42:42,0
therefore,

107
05:42:42,0 --> 05:42:42,0
who are among

108
05:42:42,0 --> 05:42:42,0
the Gentiles

109
05:42:42,0 --> 05:45:44,
flee unto Zion.

110
05:45:44,0 --> 05:45:44,0
13 And let

111
05:45:44,0 --> 05:45:44,0
them who be

112
05:45:44,0 --> 05:45:44,0
of Judah

113
05:45:44,0 --> 05:45:44,0
flee unto

114
05:45:44,0 --> 05:45:44,0
Jerusalem,

115
05:45:44,0 --> 05:45:44,0
unto the

116
05:45:44,0 --> 05:45:44,0
mountains of

117
05:45:44,0 --> 06:12:42,
the Lord’s house.

118
06:12:42,0 --> 06:12:42,0
14 Go ye

119
06:12:42,0 --> 06:12:42,0
out from

120
06:12:42,0 --> 06:12:42,0
among the

121
06:12:42,0 --> 06:12:42,0
nations,

122
06:12:42,0 --> 06:12:42,0
even from

123
06:12:42,0 --> 06:12:42,0
Babylon, from

124
06:12:42,0 --> 06:12:42,0
the midst

125
06:12:42,0 --> 06:12:42,0
of

126
06:12:42,0 --> 06:12:42,0
wickedness,

127
06:12:42,0 --> 06:12:42,0
which is

128
06:12:42,0 --> 06:16:49,
spiritual Babylon.

129
06:16:49,0 --> 06:16:49,0
15 But

130
06:16:49,0 --> 06:16:49,0
verily,

131
06:16:49,0 --> 06:16:49,0
thus saith

132
06:16:49,0 --> 06:16:49,0
the Lord,

133
06:16:49,0 --> 06:16:49,0
let not

134
06:16:49,0 --> 06:16:49,0
your

135
06:16:49,0 --> 06:16:49,0
flight be in

136
06:16:49,0 --> 06:16:49,0
haste, but

137
06:16:49,0 --> 06:16:49,0
let all

138
06:16:49,0 --> 06:16:49,0
things be

139
06:16:49,0 --> 06:16:49,0
prepared

140
06:16:49,0 --> 06:16:49,0
before

141
06:16:49,0 --> 06:16:49,0
you; and

142
06:16:49,0 --> 06:16:49,0
he that

143
06:16:49,0 --> 06:16:49,0
goeth, let

144
06:16:49,0 --> 06:16:49,0
him not

145
06:16:49,0 --> 06:16:49,0
look back

146
06:16:49,0 --> 06:16:49,0
lest

147
06:16:49,0 --> 06:16:49,0
sudden

148
06:16:49,0 --> 06:31:51,
destruction shall come upon him.

149
06:31:51,0 --> 06:31:51,0
16

150
06:31:51,0 --> 06:31:51,0
Hearken and

151
06:31:51,0 --> 06:31:51,0
hear, O

152
06:31:51,0 --> 06:31:51,0
ye

153
06:31:51,0 --> 06:31:51,0
inhabitants of

154
06:31:51,0 --> 06:31:51,0
the

155
06:31:51,0 --> 06:31:51,0
earth.

156
06:31:51,0 --> 06:31:51,0
Listen, ye

157
06:31:51,0 --> 06:31:51,0
elders of

158
06:31:51,0 --> 06:31:51,0
my

159
06:31:51,0 --> 06:31:51,0
church

160
06:31:51,0 --> 06:31:51,0
together, and

161
06:31:51,0 --> 06:31:51,0
hear

162
06:31:51,0 --> 06:31:51,0
the voice

163
06:31:51,0 --> 06:31:51,0
of the

164
06:31:51,0 --> 06:31:51,0
Lord; for

165
06:31:51,0 --> 06:31:51,0
he

166
06:31:51,0 --> 06:31:51,0
calleth upon

167
06:31:51,0 --> 06:31:51,0
all

168
06:31:51,0 --> 06:31:51,0
men, and he

169
06:31:51,0 --> 06:31:51,0


170
06:31:51,0 --> 06:31:51,0
commandeth all

171
06:31:51,0 --> 06:46:53,
men everywhere to repent.

172
06:46:53,0 --> 06:46:53,0
17 For

173
06:46:53,0 --> 06:46:53,0
behold,

174
06:46:53,0 --> 06:46:53,0
the

175
06:46:53,0 --> 06:46:53,0
Lord God

176
06:46:53,0 --> 06:46:53,0
hath

177
06:46:53,0 --> 06:46:53,0
sent

178
06:46:53,0 --> 06:46:53,0
forth the

179
06:46:53,0 --> 06:46:53,0
angel

180
06:46:53,0 --> 06:46:53,0
crying

181
06:46:53,0 --> 06:46:53,0
through

182
06:46:53,0 --> 06:46:53,0
the

183
06:46:53,0 --> 06:46:53,0
midst of

184
06:46:53,0 --> 06:46:53,0
heaven,

185
06:46:53,0 --> 06:46:53,0
saying:

186
06:46:53,0 --> 06:46:53,0
Prepare

187
06:46:53,0 --> 06:46:53,0
ye the

188
06:46:53,0 --> 06:46:53,0
way of

189
06:46:53,0 --> 06:46:53,0
the

190
06:46:53,0 --> 06:46:53,0
Lord, and

191
06:46:53,0 --> 06:46:53,0
make

192
06:46:53,0 --> 06:46:53,0
his

193
06:46:53,0 --> 06:46:53,0
paths

194
06:46:53,0 --> 06:46:53,0
straight,

195
06:46:53,0 --> 06:46:53,0
for the

196
06:46:53,0 --> 06:48:57,
hour of his coming is nigh—

197
06:48:57,0 --> 06:48:57,0
18

198
06:48:57,0 --> 06:48:57,0
When the

199
06:48:57,0 --> 06:48:57,0
Lamb

200
06:48:57,0 --> 06:48:57,0
shall

201
06:48:57,0 --> 06:48:57,0
stand

202
06:48:57,0 --> 06:48:57,0
upon

203
06:48:57,0 --> 06:48:57,0
Mount

204
06:48:57,0 --> 06:48:57,0
Zion,

205
06:48:57,0 --> 06:48:57,0
and with

206
06:48:57,0 --> 06:48:57,0
him a

207
06:48:57,0 --> 06:48:57,0


208
06:48:57,0 --> 06:48:57,0
hundred and

209
06:48:57,0 --> 06:48:57,0


210
06:48:57,0 --> 06:48:57,0
forty-four

211
06:48:57,0 --> 06:48:57,0


212
06:48:57,0 --> 06:48:57,0
thousand,

213
06:48:57,0 --> 06:48:57,0
having

214
06:48:57,0 --> 06:48:57,0
his

215
06:48:57,0 --> 06:48:57,0
Father’s

216
06:48:57,0 --> 06:48:57,0
name

217
06:48:57,0 --> 06:56:00,
written on their foreheads.

218
06:56:00,0 --> 06:56:00,0
19

219
06:56:00,0 --> 06:56:00,0


220
06:56:00,0 --> 06:56:00,0
Wherefore,

221
06:56:00,0 --> 06:56:00,0


222
06:56:00,0 --> 06:56:00,0
