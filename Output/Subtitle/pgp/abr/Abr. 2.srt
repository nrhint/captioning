00:00:05,072 --> 00:00:15,072
Chapter 2 Abraham leaves Ur to go to

2
00:00:15,072 --> 00:00:25,072
Canaan—Jehovah appears to him at Haran—All gospel

3
00:00:25,072 --> 00:00:35,072
blessings are promised to his seed and through his

4
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:45,012
seed to all—He goes to Canaan and on to Egypt. 

5
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:50,512
1 Now the Lord God caused the famine to wax

6
00:00:50,512 --> 00:00:56,012
sore in the land of Ur, insomuch that

7
00:00:56,012 --> 00:01:01,512
Haran, my brother, died; but Terah, my father,

8
00:01:01,512 --> 00:01:07,534
yet lived in the land of Ur, of the Chaldees.

9
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:12,284
2 And it came to pass that I,

10
00:01:12,284 --> 00:01:17,034
Abraham, took Sarai to wife, and

11
00:01:17,034 --> 00:01:21,784
Nahor, my brother, took Milcah to

12
00:01:21,784 --> 00:01:26,536
wife, who was the daughter of Haran.

13
00:01:26,536 --> 00:01:30,736
3 Now the Lord had said unto

14
00:01:30,736 --> 00:01:34,936
me: Abraham, get thee out of thy

15
00:01:34,936 --> 00:01:39,136
country, and from thy kindred,

16
00:01:39,136 --> 00:01:43,336
and from thy father’s house,

17
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:47,891
unto a land that I will show thee.

18
00:01:47,891 --> 00:01:52,016
4 Therefore I left the land

19
00:01:52,016 --> 00:01:56,141
of Ur, of the Chaldees, to

20
00:01:56,141 --> 00:02:00,266
go into the land of Canaan;

21
00:02:00,266 --> 00:02:04,391
and I took Lot, my brother’s

22
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:08,516
son, and his wife, and Sarai

23
00:02:08,516 --> 00:02:12,641
my wife; and also my father

24
00:02:12,641 --> 00:02:16,766
followed after me, unto the

25
00:02:16,766 --> 00:02:20,424
land which we denominated Haran.

26
00:02:20,424 --> 00:02:24,567
5 And the famine abated;

27
00:02:24,567 --> 00:02:28,71
and my father tarried in

28
00:02:28,71 --> 00:02:32,853
Haran and dwelt there, as

29
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:36,996
there were many flocks in

30
00:02:36,996 --> 00:02:41,139
Haran; and my father turned

31
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:45,282
again unto his idolatry,

32
00:02:45,282 --> 00:02:49,186
therefore he continued in Haran.

33
00:02:49,186 --> 00:02:52,853
6 But I, Abraham, and

34
00:02:52,853 --> 00:02:56,52
Lot, my brother’s son,

35
00:02:56,52 --> 00:03:00,187
prayed unto the Lord, and

36
00:03:00,187 --> 00:03:03,854
the Lord appeared unto

37
00:03:03,854 --> 00:03:07,521
me, and said unto me:

38
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:11,188
Arise, and take Lot with

39
00:03:11,188 --> 00:03:14,855
thee; for I have purposed

40
00:03:14,855 --> 00:03:18,522
to take thee away out of

41
00:03:18,522 --> 00:03:22,189
Haran, and to make of

42
00:03:22,189 --> 00:03:25,856
thee a minister to bear my

43
00:03:25,856 --> 00:03:29,523
name in a strange land

44
00:03:29,523 --> 00:03:33,19
which I will give unto

45
00:03:33,19 --> 00:03:36,857
thy seed after thee for

46
00:03:36,857 --> 00:03:40,524
an everlasting

47
00:03:40,524 --> 00:03:44,091
possession, when they hearken to my voice.

48
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:47,424
7 For I am the Lord thy

49
00:03:47,424 --> 00:03:50,757
God; I dwell in

50
00:03:50,757 --> 00:03:54,09
heaven; the earth is my

51
00:03:54,09 --> 00:03:57,423
footstool; I stretch my hand

52
00:03:57,423 --> 00:04:00,756
over the sea, and it

53
00:04:00,756 --> 00:04:04,089
obeys my voice; I cause

54
00:04:04,089 --> 00:04:07,422
the wind and the fire

55
00:04:07,422 --> 00:04:10,755
to be my chariot; I say

56
00:04:10,755 --> 00:04:14,088
to the mountains—Depart

57
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:17,421
hence—and behold, they

58
00:04:17,421 --> 00:04:20,754
are taken away by a

59
00:04:20,754 --> 00:04:24,047
whirlwind, in an instant, suddenly.

60
00:04:24,047 --> 00:04:27,047
8 My name is

61
00:04:27,047 --> 00:04:30,047
Jehovah, and I know the

62
00:04:30,047 --> 00:04:33,047
end from the

63
00:04:33,047 --> 00:04:36,047
beginning; therefore my

64
00:04:36,047 --> 00:04:39,312
hand shall be over thee.

65
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:42,026
9 And I will make

66
00:04:42,026 --> 00:04:44,74
of thee a great

67
00:04:44,74 --> 00:04:47,454
nation, and I will

68
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,168
bless thee above

69
00:04:50,168 --> 00:04:52,882
measure, and make

70
00:04:52,882 --> 00:04:55,596
thy name great among

71
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:58,31
all nations, and

72
00:04:58,31 --> 00:05:01,024
thou shalt be a

73
00:05:01,024 --> 00:05:03,738
blessing unto thy

74
00:05:03,738 --> 00:05:06,452
seed after thee,

75
00:05:06,452 --> 00:05:09,166
that in their hands

76
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,88
they shall bear

77
00:05:11,88 --> 00:05:14,594
this ministry and

78
00:05:14,594 --> 00:05:17,317
Priesthood unto all nations;

79
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,953
10 And I will

80
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:22,589
bless them through

81
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:25,225
thy name; for as

82
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:27,861
many as receive

83
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:30,497
this Gospel shall

84
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:33,133
be called after

85
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:35,769
thy name, and shall

86
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:38,405
be accounted thy

87
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:41,041
seed, and shall

88
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,677
rise up and bless

89
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,813
thee, as their father;

90
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:49,063
11 And I will

91
00:05:49,063 --> 00:05:51,313
bless them that

92
00:05:51,313 --> 00:05:53,563
bless thee, and

93
00:05:53,563 --> 00:05:55,813
curse them that

94
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:58,063
curse thee; and in

95
00:05:58,063 --> 00:06:00,313
thee (that is,

96
00:06:00,313 --> 00:06:02,563
in thy

97
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:04,813
Priesthood) and in thy

98
00:06:04,813 --> 00:06:07,063
seed (that is, thy

99
00:06:07,063 --> 00:06:09,313
Priesthood),

100
00:06:09,313 --> 00:06:11,563
for I give unto

101
00:06:11,563 --> 00:06:13,813
thee a promise

102
00:06:13,813 --> 00:06:16,063
that this right

103
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:18,313
shall continue in

104
00:06:18,313 --> 00:06:20,563
thee, and in thy

105
00:06:20,563 --> 00:06:22,813
seed after thee

106
00:06:22,813 --> 00:06:25,063
(that is to say,

107
00:06:25,063 --> 00:06:27,313
the literal

108
00:06:27,313 --> 00:06:29,563
seed, or the seed

109
00:06:29,563 --> 00:06:31,813
of the body)

110
00:06:31,813 --> 00:06:34,063
shall all the

111
00:06:34,063 --> 00:06:36,313
families of the earth

112
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:38,563
be blessed, even

113
00:06:38,563 --> 00:06:40,813
with the

114
00:06:40,813 --> 00:06:43,063
blessings of the

115
00:06:43,063 --> 00:06:45,313
Gospel, which are the

116
00:06:45,313 --> 00:06:47,563
blessings of

117
00:06:47,563 --> 00:06:49,759
salvation, even of life eternal.

118
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,577
12 Now, after

119
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,395
the Lord had

120
00:06:53,395 --> 00:06:55,213
withdrawn from

121
00:06:55,213 --> 00:06:57,031
speaking to me,

122
00:06:57,031 --> 00:06:58,849
and withdrawn his

123
00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:00,667
face from me,

124
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:02,485
I said in my

125
00:07:02,485 --> 00:07:04,303
heart: Thy

126
00:07:04,303 --> 00:07:06,121
servant has sought

127
00:07:06,121 --> 00:07:07,939
thee earnestly;

128
00:07:07,939 --> 00:07:09,379
now I have found thee;

129
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:11,546
13 Thou didst

130
00:07:11,546 --> 00:07:13,713
send thine

131
00:07:13,713 --> 00:07:15,88
angel to deliver

132
00:07:15,88 --> 00:07:18,047
me from the

133
00:07:18,047 --> 00:07:20,214
gods of Elkenah,

134
00:07:20,214 --> 00:07:22,381
and I will do

135
00:07:22,381 --> 00:07:24,548
well to

136
00:07:24,548 --> 00:07:26,715
hearken unto thy

137
00:07:26,715 --> 00:07:28,882
voice, therefore

138
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:31,049
let thy

139
00:07:31,049 --> 00:07:33,216
servant rise up and

140
00:07:33,216 --> 00:07:35,889
depart in peace.

141
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:37,434
14 So I,

142
00:07:37,434 --> 00:07:38,979
Abraham, departed

143
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:40,524
as the Lord

144
00:07:40,524 --> 00:07:42,069
had said unto

145
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:43,614
me, and Lot

146
00:07:43,614 --> 00:07:45,159
with me; and

147
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:46,704
I, Abraham,

148
00:07:46,704 --> 00:07:48,249
was sixty and

149
00:07:48,249 --> 00:07:49,794
two years old

150
00:07:49,794 --> 00:07:51,339
when I

151
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:52,222
departed out of Haran.

152
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,032
15 And I

153
00:07:54,032 --> 00:07:55,842
took Sarai,

154
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:57,652
whom I took to

155
00:07:57,652 --> 00:07:59,462
wife when I

156
00:07:59,462 --> 00:08:01,272
was in Ur,

157
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,082
in Chaldea,

158
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:04,892
and Lot, my

159
00:08:04,892 --> 00:08:06,702
brother’s

160
00:08:06,702 --> 00:08:08,512
son, and all

161
00:08:08,512 --> 00:08:10,322
our substance

162
00:08:10,322 --> 00:08:12,132
that we had

163
00:08:12,132 --> 00:08:13,942
gathered,

164
00:08:13,942 --> 00:08:15,752
and the souls

165
00:08:15,752 --> 00:08:17,562
that we had

166
00:08:17,562 --> 00:08:19,372
won in

167
00:08:19,372 --> 00:08:21,182
Haran, and came

168
00:08:21,182 --> 00:08:22,992
forth in the

169
00:08:22,992 --> 00:08:24,802
way to the

170
00:08:24,802 --> 00:08:26,612
land of

171
00:08:26,612 --> 00:08:28,422
Canaan, and dwelt

172
00:08:28,422 --> 00:08:30,193
in tents as we came on our way;

173
00:08:30,193 --> 00:08:32,27
16

174
00:08:32,27 --> 00:08:34,347
Therefore, eternity

175
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,424
was our

176
00:08:36,424 --> 00:08:38,501
covering and

177
00:08:38,501 --> 00:08:40,578
our rock

178
00:08:40,578 --> 00:08:42,655
and our

179
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:44,732
salvation, as we

180
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,809
journeyed

181
00:08:46,809 --> 00:08:48,886
from Haran

182
00:08:48,886 --> 00:08:50,963
by the way

183
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:53,04
of Jershon,

184
00:08:53,04 --> 00:08:55,117
to come to

185
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:57,187
the land of Canaan.

186
00:08:57,187 --> 00:08:58,465
17 Now I,

187
00:08:58,465 --> 00:08:59,743
Abraham,

188
00:08:59,743 --> 00:09:01,021
built an

189
00:09:01,021 --> 00:09:02,299
altar in the

190
00:09:02,299 --> 00:09:03,577
land of

191
00:09:03,577 --> 00:09:04,855
Jershon,

192
00:09:04,855 --> 00:09:06,133
and made an

193
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:07,411
offering

194
00:09:07,411 --> 00:09:08,689
unto the

195
00:09:08,689 --> 00:09:09,967
Lord, and

196
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:11,245
prayed that

197
00:09:11,245 --> 00:09:12,523
the famine

198
00:09:12,523 --> 00:09:13,801
might be

199
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:15,079
turned

200
00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:16,357
away from my

201
00:09:16,357 --> 00:09:17,635
father’s

202
00:09:17,635 --> 00:09:18,913
house, that

203
00:09:18,913 --> 00:09:20,927
they might not perish.

204
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:22,156
18 And

205
00:09:22,156 --> 00:09:23,385
then we

206
00:09:23,385 --> 00:09:24,614
passed from

207
00:09:24,614 --> 00:09:25,843
Jershon

208
00:09:25,843 --> 00:09:27,072
through

209
00:09:27,072 --> 00:09:28,301
the land

210
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:29,53
unto the

211
00:09:29,53 --> 00:09:30,759
place of

212
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:31,988
Sechem; it

213
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,217
was

214
00:09:33,217 --> 00:09:34,446
situated in

215
00:09:34,446 --> 00:09:35,675
the plains

216
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:36,904
of Moreh,

217
00:09:36,904 --> 00:09:38,133
and we

218
00:09:38,133 --> 00:09:39,362
had

219
00:09:39,362 --> 00:09:40,591
already come

220
00:09:40,591 --> 00:09:41,82
into the

221
00:09:41,82 --> 00:09:43,049
borders of

222
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,278
the land

223
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:45,507
of the

224
00:09:45,507 --> 00:09:46,736
Canaanites,

225
00:09:46,736 --> 00:09:47,965
and I

226
00:09:47,965 --> 00:09:49,194
offered

227
00:09:49,194 --> 00:09:50,423
sacrifice

228
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,652
there in

229
00:09:51,652 --> 00:09:52,881
the plains

230
00:09:52,881 --> 00:09:54,11
of Moreh,

231
00:09:54,11 --> 00:09:55,339
and

232
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:56,568
called on the

233
00:09:56,568 --> 00:09:57,797
Lord

234
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,026
devoutly,

235
00:09:59,026 --> 00:10:00,255
because we

236
00:10:00,255 --> 00:10:01,484
had

237
00:10:01,484 --> 00:10:02,713
already come

238
00:10:02,713 --> 00:10:03,937
into the land of this idolatrous nation.

239
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,091
19 And

240
00:10:05,091 --> 00:10:06,245
the Lord

241
00:10:06,245 --> 00:10:07,399
appeared

242
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,553
unto me

243
00:10:08,553 --> 00:10:09,707
in

244
00:10:09,707 --> 00:10:10,861
answer to my

00:10:12,015 --> 00:10:13,169
prayers, and

247
00:10:13,169 --> 00:10:14,323
said unto

248
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:15,477
me: Unto

249
00:10:15,477 --> 00:10:16,631
thy

250
00:10:16,631 --> 00:10:17,785
seed will I

251
00:10:17,785 --> 00:10:18,701
give this land.

252
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:19,829
20 And

253
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:20,957
I,

254
00:10:20,957 --> 00:10:22,085
Abraham,

255
00:10:22,085 --> 00:10:23,213

259
00:10:26,597 --> 00:10:27,725

260
00:10:27,725 --> 00:10:28,853

261
00:10:28,853 --> 00:10:29,981

262
00:10:29,981 --> 00:10:31,109

Lord, and

265
00:10:33,365 --> 00:10:34,493
removed

266
00:10:34,493 --> 00:10:35,621

290
00:11:01,565 --> 00:11:02,979
and called again upon the name of the Lord.

291
00:11:02,979 --> 00:11:03,823
21 And

292
00:11:03,823 --> 00:11:04,667

journeyed,

296
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:08,043
going

297
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:08,887

00:11:19,015 --> 00:11:19,859
land;

311
00:11:19,859 --> 00:11:20,703

312
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,547


313
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:22,391
Abraham,

314
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:23,235
concluded

315
00:11:23,235 --> 00:11:24,079
to go

316
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:24,923

322
00:11:29,143 --> 00:11:29,489
for the famine became very grievous.

323
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:30,249
22

324
00:11:30,249 --> 00:11:31,009
And it

said

339
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:42,409
unto

00:11:42,409 --> 00:11:43,169
