00:00:10,294 --> 00:00:16,961
Chapter 3 Abraham learns about the sun,

2
00:00:16,961 --> 00:00:23,628
moon, and stars by means of the Urim and

3
00:00:23,628 --> 00:00:30,295
Thummim—The Lord reveals to him the eternal

4
00:00:30,295 --> 00:00:36,962
nature of spirits—He learns of pre-earth life,

5
00:00:36,962 --> 00:00:43,629
foreordination, the Creation, the choosing

6
00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:50,25
of a Redeemer, and the second estate of man. 

7
00:00:50,25 --> 00:00:55,917
1 And I, Abraham, had the Urim and

8
00:00:55,917 --> 00:01:01,584
Thummim, which the Lord my God had

9
00:01:01,584 --> 00:01:07,267
given unto me, in Ur of the Chaldees;

10
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:12,067
2 And I saw the stars, that they

11
00:01:12,067 --> 00:01:16,867
were very great, and that one

12
00:01:16,867 --> 00:01:21,667
of them was nearest unto the

13
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:26,467
throne of God; and there were many

14
00:01:26,467 --> 00:01:31,792
great ones which were near unto it;

15
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:36,57
3 And the Lord said unto me:

16
00:01:36,57 --> 00:01:41,348
These are the governing

17
00:01:41,348 --> 00:01:46,126
ones; and the name of the great

18
00:01:46,126 --> 00:01:50,904
one is Kolob, because it is

19
00:01:50,904 --> 00:01:55,682
near unto me, for I am the

20
00:01:55,682 --> 00:02:00,46
Lord thy God: I have set

21
00:02:00,46 --> 00:02:05,238
this one to govern all those

22
00:02:05,238 --> 00:02:10,016
which belong to the same order

23
00:02:10,016 --> 00:02:14,534
as that upon which thou standest.

24
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:18,667
4 And the Lord said unto

25
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:22,8
me, by the Urim and Thummim,

26
00:02:22,8 --> 00:02:26,933
that Kolob was after the

27
00:02:26,933 --> 00:02:31,066
manner of the Lord, according

28
00:02:31,066 --> 00:02:35,199
to its times and seasons

29
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:39,332
in the revolutions thereof;

30
00:02:39,332 --> 00:02:43,465
that one revolution was a

31
00:02:43,465 --> 00:02:47,598
day unto the Lord, after his

32
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:51,731
manner of reckoning, it

33
00:02:51,731 --> 00:02:55,864
being one thousand years

34
00:02:55,864 --> 00:02:59,997
according to the time appointed

35
00:02:59,997 --> 00:03:04,13
unto that whereon thou

36
00:03:04,13 --> 00:03:08,263
standest. This is the

37
00:03:08,263 --> 00:03:12,396
reckoning of the Lord’s time,

38
00:03:12,396 --> 00:03:16,246
according to the reckoning of Kolob.

39
00:03:16,246 --> 00:03:20,184
5 And the Lord said unto

40
00:03:20,184 --> 00:03:24,122
me: The planet which is the

41
00:03:24,122 --> 00:03:28,06
lesser light, lesser than

42
00:03:28,06 --> 00:03:31,998
that which is to rule the

43
00:03:31,998 --> 00:03:35,936
day, even the night, is

44
00:03:35,936 --> 00:03:39,874
above or greater than that

45
00:03:39,874 --> 00:03:43,812
upon which thou standest

46
00:03:43,812 --> 00:03:47,75
in point of reckoning, for

47
00:03:47,75 --> 00:03:51,688
it moveth in order more

48
00:03:51,688 --> 00:03:55,626
slow; this is in order

49
00:03:55,626 --> 00:03:59,564
because it standeth above the

50
00:03:59,564 --> 00:04:03,502
earth upon which thou

51
00:04:03,502 --> 00:04:07,44
standest, therefore the

52
00:04:07,44 --> 00:04:11,378
reckoning of its time is not so

53
00:04:11,378 --> 00:04:15,316
many as to its number of

54
00:04:15,316 --> 00:04:19,226
days, and of months, and of years.

55
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:22,869
6 And the Lord said unto

56
00:04:22,869 --> 00:04:26,512
me: Now, Abraham, these

57
00:04:26,512 --> 00:04:30,155
two facts exist, behold

58
00:04:30,155 --> 00:04:33,798
thine eyes see it; it is

59
00:04:33,798 --> 00:04:37,441
given unto thee to know the

60
00:04:37,441 --> 00:04:41,084
times of reckoning, and

61
00:04:41,084 --> 00:04:44,727
the set time, yea, the

62
00:04:44,727 --> 00:04:48,37
set time of the earth upon

63
00:04:48,37 --> 00:04:52,013
which thou standest, and

64
00:04:52,013 --> 00:04:55,656
the set time of the

65
00:04:55,656 --> 00:04:59,299
greater light which is set to

66
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,942
rule the day, and the set

67
00:05:02,942 --> 00:05:06,585
time of the lesser light

68
00:05:06,585 --> 00:05:10,71
which is set to rule the night.

69
00:05:10,71 --> 00:05:13,71
7 Now the set time of

70
00:05:13,71 --> 00:05:16,71
the lesser light is a

71
00:05:16,71 --> 00:05:19,71
longer time as to its

72
00:05:19,71 --> 00:05:22,71
reckoning than the reckoning

73
00:05:22,71 --> 00:05:25,71
of the time of the earth

74
00:05:25,71 --> 00:05:28,261
upon which thou standest.

75
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:31,547
8 And where these two

76
00:05:31,547 --> 00:05:34,833
facts exist, there

77
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:38,119
shall be another fact

78
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:41,405
above them, that is,

79
00:05:41,405 --> 00:05:44,691
there shall be another

80
00:05:44,691 --> 00:05:47,977
planet whose reckoning of

81
00:05:47,977 --> 00:05:51,518
time shall be longer still;

82
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:54,385
9 And thus there

83
00:05:54,385 --> 00:05:57,252
shall be the reckoning

84
00:05:57,252 --> 00:06:00,119
of the time of one

85
00:06:00,119 --> 00:06:02,986
planet above another,

86
00:06:02,986 --> 00:06:05,853
until thou come

87
00:06:05,853 --> 00:06:08,72
nigh unto Kolob, which

88
00:06:08,72 --> 00:06:11,587
Kolob is after the

89
00:06:11,587 --> 00:06:14,454
reckoning of the

90
00:06:14,454 --> 00:06:17,321
Lord’s time; which Kolob

91
00:06:17,321 --> 00:06:20,188
is set nigh unto

92
00:06:20,188 --> 00:06:23,055
the throne of God, to

93
00:06:23,055 --> 00:06:25,922
govern all those

94
00:06:25,922 --> 00:06:28,789
planets which belong to

95
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:31,656
the same order as

96
00:06:31,656 --> 00:06:34,761
that upon which thou standest.

97
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:37,761
10 And it is given

98
00:06:37,761 --> 00:06:40,761
unto thee to know

99
00:06:40,761 --> 00:06:43,761
the set time of all

100
00:06:43,761 --> 00:06:46,761
the stars that are

101
00:06:46,761 --> 00:06:49,761
set to give light,

102
00:06:49,761 --> 00:06:52,761
until thou come

103
00:06:52,761 --> 00:06:55,799
near unto the throne of God.

104
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:58,924
11 Thus I,

105
00:06:58,924 --> 00:07:02,049
Abraham, talked with

106
00:07:02,049 --> 00:07:05,174
the Lord, face to

107
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:08,299
face, as one man

108
00:07:08,299 --> 00:07:11,424
talketh with

109
00:07:11,424 --> 00:07:14,549
another; and he told

110
00:07:14,549 --> 00:07:17,674
me of the works

111
00:07:17,674 --> 00:07:20,323
which his hands had made;

112
00:07:20,323 --> 00:07:23,029
12 And he said

113
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:25,735
unto me: My son,

114
00:07:25,735 --> 00:07:28,441
my son (and his

115
00:07:28,441 --> 00:07:31,147
hand was

116
00:07:31,147 --> 00:07:33,853
stretched out), behold

117
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:36,559
I will show you

118
00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:39,265
all these. And

119
00:07:39,265 --> 00:07:41,971
he put his hand

120
00:07:41,971 --> 00:07:44,677
upon mine eyes,

121
00:07:44,677 --> 00:07:47,383
and I saw those

122
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:50,089
things which his

123
00:07:50,089 --> 00:07:52,795
hands had made,

124
00:07:52,795 --> 00:07:55,501
which were many;

125
00:07:55,501 --> 00:07:58,207
and they

126
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,913
multiplied before mine

127
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:03,619
eyes, and I

128
00:08:03,619 --> 00:08:06,052
could not see the end thereof.

129
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:08,405
13 And he said

130
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,758
unto me: This

131
00:08:10,758 --> 00:08:13,111
is Shinehah,

132
00:08:13,111 --> 00:08:15,464
which is the sun.

133
00:08:15,464 --> 00:08:17,817
And he said

134
00:08:17,817 --> 00:08:20,17
unto me: Kokob,

135
00:08:20,17 --> 00:08:22,523
which is star.

136
00:08:22,523 --> 00:08:24,876
And he said unto

137
00:08:24,876 --> 00:08:27,229
me: Olea, which

138
00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:29,582
is the moon.

139
00:08:29,582 --> 00:08:31,935
And he said unto

140
00:08:31,935 --> 00:08:34,288
me: Kokaubeam,

141
00:08:34,288 --> 00:08:36,641
which

142
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,994
signifies stars, or all

143
00:08:38,994 --> 00:08:41,347
the great

144
00:08:41,347 --> 00:08:43,7
lights, which were

145
00:08:43,7 --> 00:08:46,559
in the firmament of heaven.

146
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,892
14 And it was

147
00:08:48,892 --> 00:08:51,225
in the night

148
00:08:51,225 --> 00:08:53,558
time when the

149
00:08:53,558 --> 00:08:55,891
Lord spake

150
00:08:55,891 --> 00:08:58,224
these words unto

151
00:08:58,224 --> 00:09:00,557
me: I will

152
00:09:00,557 --> 00:09:02,89
multiply thee, and

153
00:09:02,89 --> 00:09:05,223
thy seed

154
00:09:05,223 --> 00:09:07,556
after thee, like

155
00:09:07,556 --> 00:09:09,889
unto these; and

156
00:09:09,889 --> 00:09:12,222
if thou canst

157
00:09:12,222 --> 00:09:14,555
count the

158
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:16,888
number of sands,

159
00:09:16,888 --> 00:09:19,221
so shall be

160
00:09:19,221 --> 00:09:21,544
the number of thy seeds.

161
00:09:21,544 --> 00:09:23,344
15 And the

162
00:09:23,344 --> 00:09:25,144
Lord said unto

163
00:09:25,144 --> 00:09:26,944
me: Abraham,

164
00:09:26,944 --> 00:09:28,744
I show these

165
00:09:28,744 --> 00:09:30,544
things unto

166
00:09:30,544 --> 00:09:32,344
thee before ye

167
00:09:32,344 --> 00:09:34,144
go into

168
00:09:34,144 --> 00:09:35,944
Egypt, that ye

169
00:09:35,944 --> 00:09:37,744
may declare all

170
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,079
these words.

171
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,767
16 If two

172
00:09:40,767 --> 00:09:42,455
things exist,

173
00:09:42,455 --> 00:09:44,143
and there be

174
00:09:44,143 --> 00:09:45,831
one above

175
00:09:45,831 --> 00:09:47,519
the other,

176
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,207
there shall be

177
00:09:49,207 --> 00:09:50,895
greater

178
00:09:50,895 --> 00:09:52,583
things above

179
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,271
them;

180
00:09:54,271 --> 00:09:55,959
therefore Kolob is

181
00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:57,647
the greatest

182
00:09:57,647 --> 00:09:59,335
of all the

183
00:09:59,335 --> 00:10:01,023
Kokaubeam

184
00:10:01,023 --> 00:10:02,711
that thou hast

185
00:10:02,711 --> 00:10:04,399
seen,

186
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,823
because it is nearest unto me.

187
00:10:06,823 --> 00:10:08,252
17 Now, if

188
00:10:08,252 --> 00:10:09,681
there be

189
00:10:09,681 --> 00:10:11,11
two things,

190
00:10:11,11 --> 00:10:12,539
one above

191
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:13,968
the other,

192
00:10:13,968 --> 00:10:15,397
and the moon

193
00:10:15,397 --> 00:10:16,826
be above

194
00:10:16,826 --> 00:10:18,255
the earth,

195
00:10:18,255 --> 00:10:19,684
then it may

196
00:10:19,684 --> 00:10:21,113
be that a

197
00:10:21,113 --> 00:10:22,542
planet or a

198
00:10:22,542 --> 00:10:23,971
star may

199
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:25,4
exist above

200
00:10:25,4 --> 00:10:26,829
it; and there

201
00:10:26,829 --> 00:10:28,258
is nothing

202
00:10:28,258 --> 00:10:29,687
that the

203
00:10:29,687 --> 00:10:31,116
Lord thy God

204
00:10:31,116 --> 00:10:32,545
shall take

205
00:10:32,545 --> 00:10:33,974
in his

206
00:10:33,974 --> 00:10:35,403
heart to do

207
00:10:35,403 --> 00:10:36,803
but what he will do it.

208
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,436
18 Howbeit

209
00:10:38,436 --> 00:10:40,069
that he

210
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:41,702
made the

211
00:10:41,702 --> 00:10:43,335
greater

212
00:10:43,335 --> 00:10:44,968
star; as,

213
00:10:44,968 --> 00:10:46,601
also, if there

214
00:10:46,601 --> 00:10:48,234
be two

215
00:10:48,234 --> 00:10:49,867
spirits, and

216
00:10:49,867 --> 00:10:51,5
one shall

217
00:10:51,5 --> 00:10:53,133
be more

218
00:10:53,133 --> 00:10:54,766
intelligent

219
00:10:54,766 --> 00:10:56,399
than the

220
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,032
other, yet

221
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,665
these two

222
00:10:59,665 --> 00:11:01,298
spirits,

223
00:11:01,298 --> 00:11:02,931


224
00:11:02,931 --> 00:11:04,564
notwithstanding one

225
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:06,197
is more

226
00:11:06,197 --> 00:11:07,83
intelligent

227
00:11:07,83 --> 00:11:09,463
than the

228
00:11:09,463 --> 00:11:11,096
other, have

229
00:11:11,096 --> 00:11:12,729
no

230
00:11:12,729 --> 00:11:14,362
beginning; they

231
00:11:14,362 --> 00:11:15,995
existed

232
00:11:15,995 --> 00:11:17,628
before, they

233
00:11:17,628 --> 00:11:19,261
shall

234
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,894
have no end,

235
00:11:20,894 --> 00:11:22,527
they shall

236
00:11:22,527 --> 00:11:24,16
exist

237
00:11:24,16 --> 00:11:25,335
after, for they are gnolaum, or eternal.

238
00:11:25,335 --> 00:11:26,71
19 And

239
00:11:26,71 --> 00:11:28,085
the Lord

240
00:11:28,085 --> 00:11:29,46
said unto

241
00:11:29,46 --> 00:11:30,835
me: These

242
00:11:30,835 --> 00:11:32,21
two facts

243
00:11:32,21 --> 00:11:33,585
do

244
00:11:33,585 --> 00:11:34,96
exist, that

245
00:11:34,96 --> 00:11:36,335
there are

246
00:11:36,335 --> 00:11:37,71
two

247
00:11:37,71 --> 00:11:39,085
spirits, one

248
00:11:39,085 --> 00:11:40,46
being more

249
00:11:40,46 --> 00:11:41,835


250
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:43,21
intelligent than

251
00:11:43,21 --> 00:11:44,585
the other;

252
00:11:44,585 --> 00:11:45,96
there

253
00:11:45,96 --> 00:11:47,335
shall be

254
00:11:47,335 --> 00:11:48,71
another

255
00:11:48,71 --> 00:11:50,085
more

256
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:51,46
intelligent than

257
00:11:51,46 --> 00:11:52,835
they; I

258
00:11:52,835 --> 00:11:54,21
am the

259
00:11:54,21 --> 00:11:55,585
Lord thy

260
00:11:55,585 --> 00:11:56,96
God, I am

261
00:11:56,96 --> 00:11:58,334
more intelligent than they all.

262
00:11:58,334 --> 00:11:59,879
20 The

263
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:01,424
Lord thy

264
00:12:01,424 --> 00:12:02,969
God sent

265
00:12:02,969 --> 00:12:04,514
his

266
00:12:04,514 --> 00:12:06,059
angel to

267
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,604
deliver

268
00:12:07,604 --> 00:12:09,149
thee from

269
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:10,694
the

270
00:12:10,694 --> 00:12:12,239
hands of the

271
00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:13,784
priest

272
00:12:13,784 --> 00:12:15,618
of Elkenah.

273
00:12:15,618 --> 00:12:16,714
21 I

274
00:12:16,714 --> 00:12:17,81
dwell in

275
00:12:17,81 --> 00:12:18,906
the

276
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:20,002
midst of

277
00:12:20,002 --> 00:12:21,098
them

278
00:12:21,098 --> 00:12:22,194
all; I

279
00:12:22,194 --> 00:12:23,29
now,

280
00:12:23,29 --> 00:12:24,386
therefore,

281
00:12:24,386 --> 00:12:25,482

282
00:12:25,482 --> 00:12:26,578
come down

283
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:27,674
unto

284
00:12:27,674 --> 00:12:28,77
thee to

285
00:12:28,77 --> 00:12:29,866
declare

286
00:12:29,866 --> 00:12:30,962
unto

287
00:12:30,962 --> 00:12:32,058
thee the

288
00:12:32,058 --> 00:12:33,154
works

289
00:12:33,154 --> 00:12:34,25
which my

290
00:12:34,25 --> 00:12:35,346

have

292
00:12:36,442 --> 00:12:37,538
made,

293
00:12:37,538 --> 00:12:38,634
wherein my

00:13:00,554 --> 00:13:01,65
intelligences thine

315
00:13:01,65 --> 00:13:02,746

00:13:02,746 --> 00:13:03,842
have

317
00:13:03,842 --> 00:13:04,938
seen from

00:13:04,938 --> 00:13:06,034
the

319
00:13:06,034 --> 00:13:07,13
beginning;

320
00:13:07,13 --> 00:13:08,226
I came

324
00:13:11,514 --> 00:13:12,108
beginning in the midst of all the intelligences thou hast seen.

325
00:13:12,108 --> 00:13:13,441
22 Now

326
00:13:13,441 --> 00:13:14,774
the

00:13:18,773 --> 00:13:20,106


331
00:13:20,106 --> 00:13:21,439
Abraham, the

333
00:13:22,772 --> 00:13:24,105
intelligences

334
00:13:24,105 --> 00:13:25,438
that

335
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:26,771
were

336
00:13:26,771 --> 00:13:28,104
organized

337
00:13:28,104 --> 00:13:29,437
before

338
00:13:29,437 --> 00:13:30,77
the world

339
00:13:30,77 --> 00:13:32,103
was;

340
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:33,436
and

341
00:13:33,436 --> 00:13:34,769
among all

342
00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:36,102
these

343
00:13:36,102 --> 00:13:37,435
there

344
00:13:37,435 --> 00:13:38,768

345
00:13:38,768 --> 00:13:40,101

00:13:42,767 --> 00:13:44,123
great ones;

349
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:45,123
23 And

350
00:13:45,123 --> 00:13:46,123
God

351
00:13:46,123 --> 00:13:47,123
saw

352
00:13:47,123 --> 00:13:48,123
these

353
00:13:48,123 --> 00:13:49,123
souls

354
00:13:49,123 --> 00:13:50,123
that they

355
00:13:50,123 --> 00:13:51,123
were

356
00:13:51,123 --> 00:13:52,123
good,

357
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:53,123
and he

358
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:54,123
stood

359
00:13:54,123 --> 00:13:55,123
in

360
00:13:55,123 --> 00:13:56,123

362
00:13:57,123 --> 00:13:58,123
them,

363
00:13:58,123 --> 00:13:59,123
and he

364
00:13:59,123 --> 00:14:00,123
said:

365
00:14:00,123 --> 00:14:01,123
These

366
00:14:01,123 --> 00:14:02,123
I will

367
00:14:02,123 --> 00:14:03,123
make

368
00:14:03,123 --> 00:14:04,123

369
00:14:04,123 --> 00:14:05,123
rulers;

370
00:14:05,123 --> 00:14:06,123
for he

00:14:06,123 --> 00:14:07,123
stood

372
00:14:07,123 --> 00:14:08,123
among

373
00:14:08,123 --> 00:14:09,123
those

374
00:14:09,123 --> 00:14:10,123

375
00:14:10,123 --> 00:14:11,123
were

00:14:11,123 --> 00:14:12,123
spirits,

377
00:14:12,123 --> 00:14:13,123
and

378
00:14:13,123 --> 00:14:14,123
he saw

379
00:14:14,123 --> 00:14:15,123
that

380
00:14:15,123 --> 00:14:16,123
they

381
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:17,123
were

382
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:18,123
good; and

383
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:19,123
he

384
00:14:19,123 --> 00:14:20,123
said

385
00:14:20,123 --> 00:14:21,123
unto me:

386
00:14:21,123 --> 00:14:22,123


387
00:14:22,123 --> 00:14:23,123
Abraham,

388
00:14:23,123 --> 00:14:24,123
thou art

389
00:14:24,123 --> 00:14:25,123
one of

390
00:14:25,123 --> 00:14:26,883
them; thou wast chosen before thou wast born.

391
00:14:26,883 --> 00:14:27,704
24

392
00:14:27,704 --> 00:14:28,525
And

393
00:14:28,525 --> 00:14:29,346
there

394
00:14:29,346 --> 00:14:30,167
stood

395
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:30,988
one

396
00:14:30,988 --> 00:14:31,809
among

397
00:14:31,809 --> 00:14:32,63
them

398
00:14:32,63 --> 00:14:33,451
that

399
00:14:33,451 --> 00:14:34,272
was

400
00:14:34,272 --> 00:14:35,093

00:14:35,914 --> 00:14:36,735
God,

403
00:14:36,735 --> 00:14:37,556
and he

404
00:14:37,556 --> 00:14:38,377
said

405
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,198
unto

406
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:40,019

410
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:43,303
