00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:20,233
Chapter 5 The Gods finish Their planning

2
00:00:20,233 --> 00:00:24,483
of the creation of all things—They

3
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:28,733
bring to pass the Creation according to

4
00:00:28,733 --> 00:00:32,766
Their plans—Adam names every living creature. 

5
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:39,266
1 And thus we will finish the heavens

6
00:00:39,266 --> 00:00:45,796
and the earth, and all the hosts of them.

7
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:51,996
2 And the Gods said among

8
00:00:51,996 --> 00:00:58,196
themselves: On the seventh time we will end

9
00:00:58,196 --> 00:01:04,396
our work, which we have counseled; and

10
00:01:04,396 --> 00:01:10,596
we will rest on the seventh time

11
00:01:10,596 --> 00:01:16,293
from all our work which we have counseled.

12
00:01:16,293 --> 00:01:21,515
3 And the Gods concluded upon the

13
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:26,737
seventh time, because that on the

14
00:01:26,737 --> 00:01:31,959
seventh time they would rest from

15
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:37,181
all their works which they (the

16
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:42,403
Gods) counseled among themselves to

17
00:01:42,403 --> 00:01:47,625
form; and sanctified it. And thus

18
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:52,847
were their decisions at the time

19
00:01:52,847 --> 00:01:58,069
that they counseled among

20
00:01:58,069 --> 00:02:03,256
themselves to form the heavens and the earth.

21
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:06,923
4 And the Gods came down and

22
00:02:06,923 --> 00:02:10,59
formed these the

23
00:02:10,59 --> 00:02:14,257
generations of the heavens and of the

24
00:02:14,257 --> 00:02:17,924
earth, when they were formed

25
00:02:17,924 --> 00:02:21,591
in the day that the Gods

26
00:02:21,591 --> 00:02:25,045
formed the earth and the heavens,

27
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:28,59
5 According to all that

28
00:02:28,59 --> 00:02:32,135
which they had said

29
00:02:32,135 --> 00:02:35,68
concerning every plant of the

30
00:02:35,68 --> 00:02:39,225
field before it was in the

31
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:42,77
earth, and every herb of

32
00:02:42,77 --> 00:02:46,315
the field before it

33
00:02:46,315 --> 00:02:49,86
grew; for the Gods had not

34
00:02:49,86 --> 00:02:53,405
caused it to rain upon the

35
00:02:53,405 --> 00:02:56,95
earth when they counseled

36
00:02:56,95 --> 00:03:00,495
to do them, and had not

37
00:03:00,495 --> 00:03:04,284
formed a man to till the ground.

38
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:07,034
6 But there went up a

39
00:03:07,034 --> 00:03:09,784
mist from the earth,

40
00:03:09,784 --> 00:03:12,534
and watered the

41
00:03:12,534 --> 00:03:15,562
whole face of the ground.

42
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:18,262
7 And the Gods

43
00:03:18,262 --> 00:03:20,962
formed man from the dust

44
00:03:20,962 --> 00:03:23,662
of the ground, and

45
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:26,362
took his spirit (that

46
00:03:26,362 --> 00:03:29,062
is, the man’s

47
00:03:29,062 --> 00:03:31,762
spirit), and put it into

48
00:03:31,762 --> 00:03:34,462
him; and breathed

49
00:03:34,462 --> 00:03:37,162
into his nostrils the

50
00:03:37,162 --> 00:03:39,862
breath of life, and

51
00:03:39,862 --> 00:03:42,556
man became a living soul.

52
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:45,056
8 And the Gods

53
00:03:45,056 --> 00:03:47,556
planted a garden,

54
00:03:47,556 --> 00:03:50,056
eastward in Eden,

55
00:03:50,056 --> 00:03:52,556
and there they

56
00:03:52,556 --> 00:03:55,056
put the man, whose

57
00:03:55,056 --> 00:03:57,556
spirit they had

58
00:03:57,556 --> 00:04:00,056
put into the body

59
00:04:00,056 --> 00:04:02,542
which they had formed.

60
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,542
9 And out of the

61
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:06,542
ground made the

62
00:04:06,542 --> 00:04:08,542
Gods to grow

63
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:10,542
every tree that is

64
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,542
pleasant to the

65
00:04:12,542 --> 00:04:14,542
sight and good

66
00:04:14,542 --> 00:04:16,542
for food; the

67
00:04:16,542 --> 00:04:18,542
tree of life,

68
00:04:18,542 --> 00:04:20,542
also, in the midst

69
00:04:20,542 --> 00:04:22,542
of the garden,

70
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:24,542
and the tree of

71
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:26,516
knowledge of good and evil.

72
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,766
10 There was a

73
00:04:28,766 --> 00:04:31,016
river running

74
00:04:31,016 --> 00:04:33,266
out of Eden, to

75
00:04:33,266 --> 00:04:35,516
water the

76
00:04:35,516 --> 00:04:37,766
garden, and from

77
00:04:37,766 --> 00:04:40,016
thence it was

78
00:04:40,016 --> 00:04:42,266
parted and became

79
00:04:42,266 --> 00:04:44,05
into four heads.

80
00:04:44,05 --> 00:04:45,907
11 And the

81
00:04:45,907 --> 00:04:47,764
Gods took the

82
00:04:47,764 --> 00:04:49,621
man and put

83
00:04:49,621 --> 00:04:51,478
him in the

84
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:53,335
Garden of Eden,

85
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:55,192
to dress it

86
00:04:55,192 --> 00:04:57,063
and to keep it.

87
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:58,688
12 And the

88
00:04:58,688 --> 00:05:00,313
Gods

89
00:05:00,313 --> 00:05:01,938
commanded the

90
00:05:01,938 --> 00:05:03,563
man, saying:

91
00:05:03,563 --> 00:05:05,188
Of every

92
00:05:05,188 --> 00:05:06,813
tree of the

93
00:05:06,813 --> 00:05:08,438
garden thou

94
00:05:08,438 --> 00:05:10,093
mayest freely eat,

95
00:05:10,093 --> 00:05:11,537
13 But of

96
00:05:11,537 --> 00:05:12,981
the tree

97
00:05:12,981 --> 00:05:14,425
of

98
00:05:14,425 --> 00:05:15,869
knowledge of good

99
00:05:15,869 --> 00:05:17,313
and evil,

100
00:05:17,313 --> 00:05:18,757
thou shalt

101
00:05:18,757 --> 00:05:20,201
not eat

102
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:21,645
of it; for

103
00:05:21,645 --> 00:05:23,089
in the

104
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:24,533
time that

105
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:25,977
thou eatest

106
00:05:25,977 --> 00:05:27,421
thereof,

107
00:05:27,421 --> 00:05:28,865
thou shalt

108
00:05:28,865 --> 00:05:30,309
surely die.

109
00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:31,753
Now I,

110
00:05:31,753 --> 00:05:33,197
Abraham, saw

111
00:05:33,197 --> 00:05:34,641
that it

112
00:05:34,641 --> 00:05:36,085
was after

113
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,529
the Lord’s

114
00:05:37,529 --> 00:05:38,973
time,

115
00:05:38,973 --> 00:05:40,417
which was

116
00:05:40,417 --> 00:05:41,861
after the time

117
00:05:41,861 --> 00:05:43,305
of Kolob;

118
00:05:43,305 --> 00:05:44,749
for as

119
00:05:44,749 --> 00:05:46,193
yet the Gods

120
00:05:46,193 --> 00:05:47,637
had not

121
00:05:47,637 --> 00:05:49,916
appointed unto Adam his reckoning.

122
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,354
14 And

123
00:05:51,354 --> 00:05:52,792
the Gods

124
00:05:52,792 --> 00:05:54,23
said: Let

125
00:05:54,23 --> 00:05:55,668
us make an

126
00:05:55,668 --> 00:05:57,106
help

127
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,544
meet for the

128
00:05:58,544 --> 00:05:59,982
man, for

129
00:05:59,982 --> 00:06:01,42
it is

130
00:06:01,42 --> 00:06:02,858
not good

131
00:06:02,858 --> 00:06:04,296
that the

132
00:06:04,296 --> 00:06:05,734
man should

133
00:06:05,734 --> 00:06:07,172
be alone,

134
00:06:07,172 --> 00:06:08,61


135
00:06:08,61 --> 00:06:10,048
therefore we will

136
00:06:10,048 --> 00:06:11,486
form an

137
00:06:11,486 --> 00:06:12,188
help meet for him.

138
00:06:12,188 --> 00:06:13,07
15 And

139
00:06:13,07 --> 00:06:13,952
the Gods

140
00:06:13,952 --> 00:06:14,834
caused a

141
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:15,716
deep

142
00:06:15,716 --> 00:06:16,598
sleep to

143
00:06:16,598 --> 00:06:17,48
fall upon

144
00:06:17,48 --> 00:06:18,362
Adam;

145
00:06:18,362 --> 00:06:19,244
and he

146
00:06:19,244 --> 00:06:20,126
slept, and

147
00:06:20,126 --> 00:06:21,008
they

148
00:06:21,008 --> 00:06:21,89
took one

149
00:06:21,89 --> 00:06:22,772
of his

150
00:06:22,772 --> 00:06:23,654
ribs, and

151
00:06:23,654 --> 00:06:24,536
closed

152
00:06:24,536 --> 00:06:25,418
up the

153
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:26,3
flesh in

154
00:06:26,3 --> 00:06:27,187
the stead thereof;

155
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:28,187
16 And

156
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:29,187
of the

157
00:06:29,187 --> 00:06:30,187
rib

158
00:06:30,187 --> 00:06:31,187
which the

159
00:06:31,187 --> 00:06:32,187
Gods

160
00:06:32,187 --> 00:06:33,187
had taken

161
00:06:33,187 --> 00:06:34,187
from

162
00:06:34,187 --> 00:06:35,187
man,

163
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:36,187
formed

164
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,187
they a

165
00:06:37,187 --> 00:06:38,187
woman, and

166
00:06:38,187 --> 00:06:39,187


167
00:06:39,187 --> 00:06:40,467
brought her unto the man.

168
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:41,73
17 And

169
00:06:41,73 --> 00:06:42,993
Adam

170
00:06:42,993 --> 00:06:44,256
said:

171
00:06:44,256 --> 00:06:45,519
This

172
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:46,782
was

173
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:48,045
bone of

174
00:06:48,045 --> 00:06:49,308
my

175
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:50,571
bones, and

176
00:06:50,571 --> 00:06:51,834
flesh

177
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:53,097
of my

178
00:06:53,097 --> 00:06:54,36


179
00:06:54,36 --> 00:06:55,623
flesh; now

180
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:56,886
she

181
00:06:56,886 --> 00:06:58,149
shall be

182
00:06:58,149 --> 00:06:59,412


183
00:06:59,412 --> 00:07:00,675
called

184
00:07:00,675 --> 00:07:01,938
Woman,

185
00:07:01,938 --> 00:07:03,201
because

186
00:07:03,201 --> 00:07:04,207
she was taken out of man;

187
00:07:04,207 --> 00:07:04,907
18

188
00:07:04,907 --> 00:07:05,607


189
00:07:05,607 --> 00:07:06,307
Therefore

190
00:07:06,307 --> 00:07:07,007
shall a

191
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,707
man

192
00:07:07,707 --> 00:07:08,407
leave

193
00:07:08,407 --> 00:07:09,107
his

195
00:07:09,807 --> 00:07:10,507
father and

196
00:07:10,507 --> 00:07:11,207
his

197
00:07:11,207 --> 00:07:11,907


198
00:07:11,907 --> 00:07:12,607
mother,

199
00:07:12,607 --> 00:07:13,307
and

200
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:14,007
shall

201
00:07:14,007 --> 00:07:14,707
cleave

202
00:07:14,707 --> 00:07:15,407
unto

203
00:07:15,407 --> 00:07:16,107
his

204
00:07:16,107 --> 00:07:16,807
wife,

205
00:07:16,807 --> 00:07:17,507
