00:00:50,25 --> 00:00:53,75
The Book of AbrahamTranslated from the

2
00:00:53,75 --> 00:00:57,25
Papyrus, by Joseph Smith A Translation of some

3
00:00:57,25 --> 00:01:00,75
ancient Records that have fallen into our hands

4
00:01:00,75 --> 00:01:04,25
from the catacombs of Egypt. The writings of

5
00:01:04,25 --> 00:01:07,75
Abraham while he was in Egypt, called the Book

6
00:01:07,75 --> 00:01:11,25
of Abraham, written by his own hand, upon

7
00:01:11,25 --> 00:01:14,75
papyrus.Chapter 1 Abraham seeks the blessings

8
00:01:14,75 --> 00:01:18,25
of the patriarchal order—He is persecuted by

9
00:01:18,25 --> 00:01:21,75
false priests in Chaldea—Jehovah saves him—The

10
00:01:21,75 --> 00:01:25,919
origins and government of Egypt are reviewed. 

11
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:30,419
1 In the land of the Chaldeans, at

12
00:01:30,419 --> 00:01:34,919
the residence of my fathers, I,

13
00:01:34,919 --> 00:01:39,419
Abraham, saw that it was needful for me

14
00:01:39,419 --> 00:01:43,453
to obtain another place of residence;

15
00:01:43,453 --> 00:01:48,218
2 And, finding there was greater

16
00:01:48,218 --> 00:01:52,983
happiness and peace and rest for

17
00:01:52,983 --> 00:01:57,748
me, I sought for the blessings of

18
00:01:57,748 --> 00:02:02,513
the fathers, and the right whereunto

19
00:02:02,513 --> 00:02:07,278
I should be ordained to

20
00:02:07,278 --> 00:02:12,043
administer the same; having been myself a

21
00:02:12,043 --> 00:02:16,808
follower of righteousness, desiring

22
00:02:16,808 --> 00:02:21,573
also to be one who possessed

23
00:02:21,573 --> 00:02:26,338
great knowledge, and to be a greater

24
00:02:26,338 --> 00:02:31,103
follower of righteousness, and to

25
00:02:31,103 --> 00:02:35,868
possess a greater knowledge, and to

26
00:02:35,868 --> 00:02:40,633
be a father of many nations, a

27
00:02:40,633 --> 00:02:45,398
prince of peace, and desiring to

28
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:50,163
receive instructions, and to keep the

29
00:02:50,163 --> 00:02:54,928
commandments of God, I became a

30
00:02:54,928 --> 00:02:59,693
rightful heir, a High Priest,

31
00:02:59,693 --> 00:03:04,918
holding the right belonging to the fathers.

32
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:09,818
3 It was conferred upon me

33
00:03:09,818 --> 00:03:14,718
from the fathers; it came down

34
00:03:14,718 --> 00:03:19,618
from the fathers, from the

35
00:03:19,618 --> 00:03:24,518
beginning of time, yea, even from

36
00:03:24,518 --> 00:03:29,418
the beginning, or before the

37
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:34,318
foundation of the earth, down to

38
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:39,218
the present time, even the

39
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:44,118
right of the firstborn, or the

40
00:03:44,118 --> 00:03:49,018
first man, who is Adam, or

41
00:03:49,018 --> 00:03:53,266
first father, through the fathers unto me.

42
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:56,466
4 I sought for mine

43
00:03:56,466 --> 00:03:59,666
appointment unto the

44
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:02,866
Priesthood according to the

45
00:04:02,866 --> 00:04:06,066
appointment of God unto the

46
00:04:06,066 --> 00:04:09,583
fathers concerning the seed.

47
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,694
5 My fathers, having

48
00:04:12,694 --> 00:04:15,805
turned from their

49
00:04:15,805 --> 00:04:18,916
righteousness, and from the holy

50
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:22,027
commandments which the

51
00:04:22,027 --> 00:04:25,138
Lord their God had given

52
00:04:25,138 --> 00:04:28,249
unto them, unto the

53
00:04:28,249 --> 00:04:31,36
worshiping of the gods of

54
00:04:31,36 --> 00:04:34,471
the heathen, utterly

55
00:04:34,471 --> 00:04:37,894
refused to hearken to my voice;

56
00:04:37,894 --> 00:04:41,338
6 For their hearts

57
00:04:41,338 --> 00:04:44,782
were set to do evil,

58
00:04:44,782 --> 00:04:48,226
and were wholly turned

59
00:04:48,226 --> 00:04:51,67
to the god of

60
00:04:51,67 --> 00:04:55,114
Elkenah, and the god of

61
00:04:55,114 --> 00:04:58,558
Libnah, and the god of

62
00:04:58,558 --> 00:05:02,002
Mahmackrah, and the god

63
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:05,446
of Korash, and the

64
00:05:05,446 --> 00:05:08,892
god of Pharaoh, king of Egypt;

65
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:12,463
7 Therefore they

66
00:05:12,463 --> 00:05:16,034
turned their hearts to

67
00:05:16,034 --> 00:05:19,605
the sacrifice of the

68
00:05:19,605 --> 00:05:23,176
heathen in offering

69
00:05:23,176 --> 00:05:26,747
up their children

70
00:05:26,747 --> 00:05:30,318
unto these dumb

71
00:05:30,318 --> 00:05:33,889
idols, and hearkened not

72
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:37,46
unto my voice, but

73
00:05:37,46 --> 00:05:41,031
endeavored to take

74
00:05:41,031 --> 00:05:44,602
away my life by the

75
00:05:44,602 --> 00:05:48,173
hand of the priest of

76
00:05:48,173 --> 00:05:51,744
Elkenah. The priest

77
00:05:51,744 --> 00:05:55,315
of Elkenah was also

78
00:05:55,315 --> 00:05:58,858
the priest of Pharaoh.

79
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,95
8 Now, at this time

80
00:06:01,95 --> 00:06:05,041
it was the custom

81
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:08,132
of the priest of

82
00:06:08,132 --> 00:06:11,222
Pharaoh, the king of

83
00:06:11,222 --> 00:06:14,313
Egypt, to offer up

84
00:06:14,313 --> 00:06:17,404
upon the altar

85
00:06:17,404 --> 00:06:20,495
which was built in the

86
00:06:20,495 --> 00:06:23,587
land of Chaldea,

87
00:06:23,587 --> 00:06:26,678
for the offering unto

88
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:29,769
these strange

89
00:06:29,769 --> 00:06:32,626
gods, men, women, and children.

90
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:35,353
9 And it came to

91
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:38,08
pass that the

92
00:06:38,08 --> 00:06:40,807
priest made an

93
00:06:40,807 --> 00:06:43,534
offering unto the god

94
00:06:43,534 --> 00:06:46,261
of Pharaoh, and

95
00:06:46,261 --> 00:06:48,988
also unto the god

96
00:06:48,988 --> 00:06:51,715
of Shagreel, even

97
00:06:51,715 --> 00:06:54,442
after the manner

98
00:06:54,442 --> 00:06:57,169
of the

99
00:06:57,169 --> 00:06:59,896
Egyptians. Now the god of

100
00:06:59,896 --> 00:07:02,606
Shagreel was the sun.

101
00:07:02,606 --> 00:07:05,706
10 Even the

102
00:07:05,706 --> 00:07:08,806
thank-offering of a

103
00:07:08,806 --> 00:07:11,906
child did the

104
00:07:11,906 --> 00:07:15,006
priest of Pharaoh

105
00:07:15,006 --> 00:07:18,106
offer upon the

106
00:07:18,106 --> 00:07:21,206
altar which stood

107
00:07:21,206 --> 00:07:24,306
by the hill

108
00:07:24,306 --> 00:07:27,406
called Potiphar’s

109
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:30,506
Hill, at the head

110
00:07:30,506 --> 00:07:33,603
of the plain of Olishem.

111
00:07:33,603 --> 00:07:35,686
11 Now, this

112
00:07:35,686 --> 00:07:37,769
priest had

113
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:39,852
offered upon this

114
00:07:39,852 --> 00:07:41,935
altar three

115
00:07:41,935 --> 00:07:44,018
virgins at one time,

116
00:07:44,018 --> 00:07:46,101
who were the

117
00:07:46,101 --> 00:07:48,184
daughters of

118
00:07:48,184 --> 00:07:50,267
Onitah, one of the

119
00:07:50,267 --> 00:07:52,35
royal descent

120
00:07:52,35 --> 00:07:54,433
directly from

121
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:56,516
the loins of Ham.

122
00:07:56,516 --> 00:07:58,599
These virgins

123
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:00,682
were offered up

124
00:08:00,682 --> 00:08:02,765
because of

125
00:08:02,765 --> 00:08:04,848
their virtue; they

126
00:08:04,848 --> 00:08:06,931
would not bow

127
00:08:06,931 --> 00:08:09,014
down to worship

128
00:08:09,014 --> 00:08:11,097
gods of wood

129
00:08:11,097 --> 00:08:13,18
or of stone,

130
00:08:13,18 --> 00:08:15,263
therefore they

131
00:08:15,263 --> 00:08:17,346
were killed upon

132
00:08:17,346 --> 00:08:19,429
this altar, and

133
00:08:19,429 --> 00:08:21,512
it was done

134
00:08:21,512 --> 00:08:23,353
after the manner of the Egyptians.

135
00:08:23,353 --> 00:08:24,797
12 And it came

136
00:08:24,797 --> 00:08:26,241
to pass that

137
00:08:26,241 --> 00:08:27,685
the priests

138
00:08:27,685 --> 00:08:29,129
laid violence

139
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:30,573
upon me, that

140
00:08:30,573 --> 00:08:32,017
they might slay

141
00:08:32,017 --> 00:08:33,461
me also, as

142
00:08:33,461 --> 00:08:34,905
they did those

143
00:08:34,905 --> 00:08:36,349
virgins upon

144
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,793
this altar; and

145
00:08:37,793 --> 00:08:39,237
that you may

146
00:08:39,237 --> 00:08:40,681
have a

147
00:08:40,681 --> 00:08:42,125
knowledge of this

148
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,569
altar, I will

149
00:08:43,569 --> 00:08:45,013
refer you to the

150
00:08:45,013 --> 00:08:46,457
representation

151
00:08:46,457 --> 00:08:47,901
at the

152
00:08:47,901 --> 00:08:49,629
commencement of this record.

153
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:52,496
13 It was

154
00:08:52,496 --> 00:08:55,363
made after the

155
00:08:55,363 --> 00:08:58,23
form of a

156
00:08:58,23 --> 00:09:01,097
bedstead, such as

157
00:09:01,097 --> 00:09:03,964
was had

158
00:09:03,964 --> 00:09:06,831
among the

159
00:09:06,831 --> 00:09:09,698
Chaldeans, and it

160
00:09:09,698 --> 00:09:12,565
stood before

161
00:09:12,565 --> 00:09:15,432
the gods of

162
00:09:15,432 --> 00:09:18,299
Elkenah, Libnah,

163
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:21,166
Mahmackrah,

164
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:24,033
Korash, and

165
00:09:24,033 --> 00:09:26,9
also a god

166
00:09:26,9 --> 00:09:29,767
like unto that

167
00:09:29,767 --> 00:09:32,639
of Pharaoh, king of Egypt.

168
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,521
14 That you

169
00:09:34,521 --> 00:09:36,403
may have an

170
00:09:36,403 --> 00:09:38,285


171
00:09:38,285 --> 00:09:40,167
understanding of these

172
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:42,049
gods, I have

173
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:43,931
given you

174
00:09:43,931 --> 00:09:45,813
the fashion of

175
00:09:45,813 --> 00:09:47,695
them in the

176
00:09:47,695 --> 00:09:49,577
figures at

177
00:09:49,577 --> 00:09:51,459
the

178
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:53,341
beginning, which

179
00:09:53,341 --> 00:09:55,223
manner of

180
00:09:55,223 --> 00:09:57,105
figures is called

181
00:09:57,105 --> 00:09:58,987
by the

182
00:09:58,987 --> 00:10:00,869
Chaldeans

183
00:10:00,869 --> 00:10:02,751
Rahleenos, which

184
00:10:02,751 --> 00:10:04,921
signifies hieroglyphics.

185
00:10:04,921 --> 00:10:06,383
15 And as

186
00:10:06,383 --> 00:10:07,845
they lifted

187
00:10:07,845 --> 00:10:09,307
up their

188
00:10:09,307 --> 00:10:10,769
hands upon

189
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:12,231
me, that they

190
00:10:12,231 --> 00:10:13,693
might

191
00:10:13,693 --> 00:10:15,155
offer me up and

192
00:10:15,155 --> 00:10:16,617
take away

193
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:18,079
my life,

194
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,541
behold, I

195
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:21,003
lifted up my

196
00:10:21,003 --> 00:10:22,465
voice unto

197
00:10:22,465 --> 00:10:23,927
the Lord my

198
00:10:23,927 --> 00:10:25,389
God, and

199
00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:26,851
the Lord

200
00:10:26,851 --> 00:10:28,313
hearkened and

201
00:10:28,313 --> 00:10:29,775
heard, and

202
00:10:29,775 --> 00:10:31,237
he filled me

203
00:10:31,237 --> 00:10:32,699
with the

204
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:34,161
vision of

205
00:10:34,161 --> 00:10:35,623
the Almighty,

206
00:10:35,623 --> 00:10:37,085
and the

207
00:10:37,085 --> 00:10:38,547
angel of his

208
00:10:38,547 --> 00:10:40,009
presence

209
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:41,471
stood by me,

210
00:10:41,471 --> 00:10:42,442
and immediately unloosed my bands;

211
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:43,9
16 And his

212
00:10:43,9 --> 00:10:45,358
voice was

213
00:10:45,358 --> 00:10:46,816
unto me:

214
00:10:46,816 --> 00:10:48,274
Abraham,

215
00:10:48,274 --> 00:10:49,732
Abraham,

216
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,19
behold, my

218
00:10:52,648 --> 00:10:54,106
Jehovah, and

219
00:10:54,106 --> 00:10:55,564
I have

220
00:10:55,564 --> 00:10:57,022
heard thee,

221
00:10:57,022 --> 00:10:58,48
and have

222
00:10:58,48 --> 00:10:59,938
come down to

223
00:10:59,938 --> 00:11:01,396
deliver

224
00:11:01,396 --> 00:11:02,854
thee, and

225
00:11:02,854 --> 00:11:04,312
to take

226
00:11:04,312 --> 00:11:05,77
thee away

227
00:11:05,77 --> 00:11:07,228
from thy

228
00:11:07,228 --> 00:11:08,686

229
00:11:08,686 --> 00:11:10,144
house, and from

230
00:11:10,144 --> 00:11:11,602
all thy

231
00:11:11,602 --> 00:11:13,06
kinsfolk,

232
00:11:13,06 --> 00:11:14,518

233
00:11:14,518 --> 00:11:15,976
strange land

234
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:17,193
which thou knowest not of;

235
00:11:17,193 --> 00:11:18,536
17 And

236
00:11:18,536 --> 00:11:19,879
this

237
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,222
because they

238
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,565
have turned

239
00:11:22,565 --> 00:11:23,908
their

240
00:11:23,908 --> 00:11:25,251
hearts away

241
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:26,594
from me,

242
00:11:26,594 --> 00:11:27,937
to

243
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,28
worship the

244
00:11:29,28 --> 00:11:30,623
god of

245
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:31,966
Elkenah, and

246
00:11:31,966 --> 00:11:33,309
the god

247
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:34,652
of Libnah,

248
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:35,995
and the

249
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:37,338

250
00:11:37,338 --> 00:11:38,681

and the

252
00:11:40,024 --> 00:11:41,367
god of

253
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,71

254
00:11:42,71 --> 00:11:44,053
the god

255
00:11:44,053 --> 00:11:45,396

256
00:11:45,396 --> 00:11:46,739
Pharaoh, king

257
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:48,082
of Egypt;

258
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,425
therefore

259
00:11:49,425 --> 00:11:50,768
I have

260
00:11:50,768 --> 00:11:52,111
come down

261
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,454
to visit

262
00:11:53,454 --> 00:11:54,797
them, and

263
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,14
to

264
00:11:56,14 --> 00:11:57,483
destroy him

265
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:58,826
who hath

266
00:11:58,826 --> 00:12:00,169
lifted up

267
00:12:00,169 --> 00:12:01,512

268
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:02,855

269
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:04,44
thee, Abraham, my son, to take away thy life.

270
00:12:04,44 --> 00:12:05,718
18

271
00:12:05,718 --> 00:12:06,996
Behold, I

272
00:12:06,996 --> 00:12:08,274

273
00:12:08,274 --> 00:12:09,552
thee by

274
00:12:09,552 --> 00:12:10,83
my hand,

275
00:12:10,83 --> 00:12:12,108
and I

276
00:12:12,108 --> 00:12:13,386
will take

277
00:12:13,386 --> 00:12:14,664

00:12:14,664 --> 00:12:15,942
put

279
00:12:15,942 --> 00:12:17,22

288
00:12:27,463 --> 00:12:28,639
19 As it

289
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,815
was

290
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:30,991

302
00:12:43,927 --> 00:12:45,103
forever,

303
00:12:45,103 --> 00:12:46,279
for I am

304
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:47,8
thy God.

305
00:12:47,8 --> 00:12:49,15
20

306
00:12:49,15 --> 00:12:50,5
Behold,

307
00:12:50,5 --> 00:12:51,85
Potiphar’s

308
00:12:51,85 --> 00:12:53,2

309
00:12:53,2 --> 00:12:54,55
was in

310
00:12:54,55 --> 00:12:55,9
the land

311
00:12:55,9 --> 00:12:57,25

And the

00:13:16,15 --> 00:13:17,5
utterly

327
00:13:17,5 --> 00:13:18,85
destroyed

328
00:13:18,85 --> 00:13:20,2
them, and

329
00:13:20,2 --> 00:13:21,55
smote

330
00:13:21,55 --> 00:13:22,9

332
00:13:24,25 --> 00:13:25,6

333
00:13:25,6 --> 00:13:26,95
died; and

334
00:13:26,95 --> 00:13:28,3

335
00:13:28,3 --> 00:13:29,65

336
00:13:29,65 --> 00:13:31,0

337
00:13:31,0 --> 00:13:32,35

00:13:32,35 --> 00:13:33,7


339
00:13:33,7 --> 00:13:35,05

340
00:13:35,05 --> 00:13:36,4

Pharaoh; which Pharaoh signifies king by royal blood.

345
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:42,587
21 Now

Egyptians, and

373
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:04,376
