1
00:00:21,505 --> 00:00:34,838
1 We believe in God, the

2
00:00:34,838 --> 00:00:48,171
Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus

3
00:00:48,171 --> 00:01:01,461
Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.

4
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:01,461
2 We believe that men will be

5
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:01,461
punished for their own sins,

6
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:01,812
and not for Adam’s transgression.

7
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:04,812
3 We believe that through

8
00:01:04,812 --> 00:01:07,812
the Atonement of Christ,

9
00:01:07,812 --> 00:01:10,812
all mankind may be saved,

10
00:01:10,812 --> 00:01:13,812
by obedience to the laws

11
00:01:13,812 --> 00:01:16,743
and ordinances of the Gospel.

12
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,943
4 We believe that the

13
00:01:19,943 --> 00:01:23,143
first principles and

14
00:01:23,143 --> 00:01:26,343
ordinances of the Gospel are:

15
00:01:26,343 --> 00:01:29,543
first, Faith in the

16
00:01:29,543 --> 00:01:32,743
Lord Jesus Christ; second,

17
00:01:32,743 --> 00:01:35,943
Repentance; third,

18
00:01:35,943 --> 00:01:39,143
Baptism by immersion for the

19
00:01:39,143 --> 00:01:42,343
remission of sins;

20
00:01:42,343 --> 00:01:45,543
fourth, Laying on of hands

21
00:01:45,543 --> 00:01:48,275
for the gift of the Holy Ghost.

22
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:51,15
5 We believe that a

23
00:01:51,15 --> 00:01:54,025
man must be called of

24
00:01:54,025 --> 00:01:56,9
God, by prophecy, and by

25
00:01:56,9 --> 00:01:59,775
the laying on of

26
00:01:59,775 --> 00:02:02,65
hands by those who are in

27
00:02:02,65 --> 00:02:05,525
authority, to preach

28
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:08,4
the Gospel and

29
00:02:08,4 --> 00:02:11,031
administer in the ordinances thereof.

30
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:15,031
6 We believe in the

31
00:02:15,031 --> 00:02:19,031
same organization that

32
00:02:19,031 --> 00:02:23,031
existed in the

33
00:02:23,031 --> 00:02:27,031
Primitive Church, namely,

34
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:31,031
apostles, prophets,

35
00:02:31,031 --> 00:02:35,031
pastors, teachers,

36
00:02:35,031 --> 00:02:39,026
evangelists, and so forth.

37
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:43,193
7 We believe in the

38
00:02:43,193 --> 00:02:47,36
gift of tongues,

39
00:02:47,36 --> 00:02:51,527
prophecy,

40
00:02:51,527 --> 00:02:55,694
revelation, visions, healing,

41
00:02:55,694 --> 00:02:59,861
interpretation of

42
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:04,835
tongues, and so forth.

43
00:03:04,835 --> 00:03:10,835
8 We believe the

44
00:03:10,835 --> 00:03:16,835
Bible to be the

45
00:03:16,835 --> 00:03:22,835
word of God as far

46
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:28,835
as it is

47
00:03:28,835 --> 00:03:34,835
translated correctly; we

48
00:03:34,835 --> 00:03:40,835
also believe the

49
00:03:40,835 --> 00:03:46,835
Book of Mormon

50
00:03:46,835 --> 00:03:52,783
to be the word of God.

51
00:03:52,783 --> 00:03:52,874
9 We believe

52
00:03:52,874 --> 00:03:52,965
all that God has

53
00:03:52,965 --> 00:03:53,056
revealed, all

54
00:03:53,056 --> 00:03:53,147
that He does now

55
00:03:53,147 --> 00:03:53,238
reveal, and we

56
00:03:53,238 --> 00:03:53,329
believe that

57
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:53,42
He will yet

58
00:03:53,42 --> 00:03:53,511
reveal many great

59
00:03:53,511 --> 00:03:53,602
and important

60
00:03:53,602 --> 00:03:53,693
things pertaining

61
00:03:53,693 --> 00:03:53,116
to the Kingdom of God.

62
00:03:53,116 --> 00:03:55,327
10 We believe

63
00:03:55,327 --> 00:03:57,538
in the literal

64
00:03:57,538 --> 00:03:59,749
gathering of

65
00:03:59,749 --> 00:04:01,96
Israel and in the

66
00:04:01,96 --> 00:04:04,171
restoration of

67
00:04:04,171 --> 00:04:06,382
the Ten Tribes;

68
00:04:06,382 --> 00:04:08,593
that Zion (the

69
00:04:08,593 --> 00:04:10,804
New Jerusalem)

70
00:04:10,804 --> 00:04:13,015
will be built

71
00:04:13,015 --> 00:04:15,226
upon the

72
00:04:15,226 --> 00:04:17,437
American continent;

73
00:04:17,437 --> 00:04:19,648
that Christ will

74
00:04:19,648 --> 00:04:21,859
reign

75
00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:24,07
personally upon the

76
00:04:24,07 --> 00:04:26,281
earth; and, that

77
00:04:26,281 --> 00:04:28,492
the earth will

78
00:04:28,492 --> 00:04:30,703
be renewed and

79
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:32,914
receive its

80
00:04:32,914 --> 00:04:35,876
paradisiacal glory.

81
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:38,414
11 We claim

82
00:04:38,414 --> 00:04:40,952
the privilege of

83
00:04:40,952 --> 00:04:43,49
worshiping

84
00:04:43,49 --> 00:04:46,028
Almighty God

85
00:04:46,028 --> 00:04:48,566
according to the

86
00:04:48,566 --> 00:04:51,104
dictates of

87
00:04:51,104 --> 00:04:53,642
our own

88
00:04:53,642 --> 00:04:56,18
conscience, and allow

89
00:04:56,18 --> 00:04:58,718
all men the

90
00:04:58,718 --> 00:05:01,256
same privilege,

91
00:05:01,256 --> 00:05:03,794
let them

92
00:05:03,794 --> 00:05:06,332
worship how, where,

93
00:05:06,332 --> 00:05:08,225
or what they may.

94
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,336
12 We believe

95
00:05:10,336 --> 00:05:12,447
in being

96
00:05:12,447 --> 00:05:14,558
subject to

97
00:05:14,558 --> 00:05:16,669
kings, presidents,

98
00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:18,78
rulers, and

99
00:05:18,78 --> 00:05:20,891
magistrates,

100
00:05:20,891 --> 00:05:23,002
in obeying,

101
00:05:23,002 --> 00:05:25,113
honoring, and

102
00:05:25,113 --> 00:05:27,227
sustaining the law.

103
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:28,694
13 We

104
00:05:28,694 --> 00:05:30,161
believe in being

105
00:05:30,161 --> 00:05:31,628
honest, true,

106
00:05:31,628 --> 00:05:33,095
chaste,

107
00:05:33,095 --> 00:05:34,562
benevolent,

108
00:05:34,562 --> 00:05:36,029
virtuous, and

109
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:37,496
in doing good

110
00:05:37,496 --> 00:05:38,963
to all men;

111
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:40,43
indeed, we

112
00:05:40,43 --> 00:05:41,897
may say that

113
00:05:41,897 --> 00:05:43,364
we follow

114
00:05:43,364 --> 00:05:44,831
the

115
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,298
admonition of Paul—We

116
00:05:46,298 --> 00:05:47,765
believe all

117
00:05:47,765 --> 00:05:49,232
things, we

118
00:05:49,232 --> 00:05:50,699
hope all

119
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:52,166
things, we have

120
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,633
endured

121
00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:55,1
many things,

122
00:05:55,1 --> 00:05:56,567
and hope to be

123
00:05:56,567 --> 00:05:58,034
able to

124
00:05:58,034 --> 00:05:59,501
endure all

125
00:05:59,501 --> 00:06:00,968
things. If there

126
00:06:00,968 --> 00:06:02,435
is anything

127
00:06:02,435 --> 00:06:03,902
virtuous,

128
00:06:03,902 --> 00:06:05,369
lovely, or of

129
00:06:05,369 --> 00:06:06,836
good report

130
00:06:06,836 --> 00:06:08,303
or

131
00:06:08,303 --> 00:06:09,77
praiseworthy, we

132
00:06:09,77 --> 00:06:11,187
seek after these things.Joseph Smith.
