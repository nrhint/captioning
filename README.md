# captioning
captions the ASL videos for the book of mormon

<b>What the project does:</b>
  This is for adding captions fo the ASL Book of Mormon

<b>Why the project is useful:</b>
  This is usefuel because it will autogenerate the srt file then you cna batch un in the captions using another program or you can leave the files seperate. This will cut down on the time needed to caption each video as they are on average about 15 minuts long and captioning 60+ hours of video would take FOREVER.

<b>How users can get started with the project:</b>
  Eventaully this will be able to caption any video using a varity of methods. You can press a key to ste the timestamps for the captions of a videl. That way if you havd a play with a script then you could paste the script into a file then have enter seperated dialouge and the proram would take the timestamps of your key presses and allow you to add the captions for the speaker.

<b>Where users can get help with your project:</b>
  Right now, google... We do not have a lot of time so chances are google will have to help you

<b>Who maintains and contributes to the project:</b>
  Elder Hinton who is currently a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the founder of the idea and built the first prototype and draft. He then reached out to Ryan Hinton his dad for help and advice on how to proceed. Now a frind Brother Golf is helping with the coding and teaching Elder Hinton how to use git better.

<h1>Using the program:</h1>
Starting off. This program will do several things. It will read the D&C videos from <a href='https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament?lang=ase'>here</a>. After that it will take the text and try to match the text with the verse of the scripture. This will then generate a srt file to displa the captions for these videos. There are 2 methods for doing this. For missionaries who have MASS on their phone you can use this project to have captions in 2 was. You can use a computer and download the video then show it. Note that it is illigal to distribute these videos. Don't do it. You CAN though distribute the generated SRT files. Then using a program like VLC you can plug in the adress for the video and stream it to your phonw which works fine with MASS and then select a subtitle file for the stream that is located on your phone. The other part of this will be used to caption videos. For this you will need to have a text file with all of your words for the captions. For an example of what this could look like is:
<hr>
Elder Hinton: Hi Elder Thompson, hoe are you doing?
Elder Thompson: Hi, I am doing good. How about you?
Elder Hinton: I am doing well.
<hr>
You would then play the video and while Elder Hinton is talking you would press and hold a key until he stopps talking then while Elder Thompsonis talking you press and hold a key. This makes it easy to caption speach because all you have to do is type it up into a file with an enter at the end of each speaker. This is much faster than captioning them with another program because all you have to do is type it all up then press a key while the people are speaking. You could then take the venerated srt file and burn the  captions into the video using a program like handbrake. Eventaully this will do that for you but right now that is not what it does.
