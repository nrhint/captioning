Chapter 2Lehi takes his family into the wilderness by the 

1
0:0:7,957 --> 0:0:15,915
Red Sea—They leave their property—Lehi offers a sacrifice to the 

2
0:0:15,915 --> 0:0:23,872
Lord and teaches his sons to keep the commandments—Laman and 

3
0:0:23,872 --> 0:0:31,829
Lemuel murmur against their father—Nephi is obedient and prays in 

4
0:0:31,829 --> 0:0:39,787
faith; the Lord speaks to him, and he is chosen 

5
0:0:39,787 --> 0:0:47,744
to rule over his brethren. About 600 B.C. 

6
0:0:47,744 --> 0:0:54,393
1 For behold, it came to pass that the Lord 

7
0:0:54,393 --> 0:1:1,043
spake unto my father, yea, even in a dream, and 

8
0:1:1,043 --> 0:1:7,692
said unto him: Blessed art thou Lehi, because of the 

9
0:1:7,692 --> 0:1:14,342
things which thou hast done; and because thou hast been 

10
0:1:14,342 --> 0:1:20,992
faithful and declared unto this people the things which I 

11
0:1:20,992 --> 0:1:27,641
commanded thee, behold, they seek to take away thy life. 

12
0:1:27,641 --> 0:1:34,263
2 And it came to pass that the Lord commanded 

13
0:1:34,263 --> 0:1:40,884
my father, even in a dream, that he should take 

14
0:1:40,884 --> 0:1:47,506
his family and depart into the wilderness. 

15
0:1:47,506 --> 0:1:52,019
3 And it came to pass that he was obedient 

16
0:1:52,019 --> 0:1:56,533
unto the word of the Lord, wherefore he did as 

17
0:1:56,533 --> 0:2:1,047
the Lord commanded him. 

18
0:2:1,047 --> 0:2:7,95
4 And it came to pass that he departed into 

19
0:2:7,95 --> 0:2:14,853
the wilderness. And he left his house, and the land 

20
0:2:14,853 --> 0:2:21,756
of his inheritance, and his gold, and his silver, and 

21
0:2:21,756 --> 0:2:28,659
his precious things, and took nothing with him, save it 

22
0:2:28,659 --> 0:2:35,563
were his family, and provisions, and tents, and departed into 

23
0:2:35,563 --> 0:2:42,466
the wilderness. 

24
0:2:42,466 --> 0:2:50,084
5 And he came down by the borders near the 

25
0:2:50,084 --> 0:2:57,702
shore of the Red Sea; and he traveled in the 

26
0:2:57,702 --> 0:3:5,32
wilderness in the borders which are nearer the Red Sea; 

27
0:3:5,32 --> 0:3:12,938
and he did travel in the wilderness with his family, 

28
0:3:12,938 --> 0:3:20,556
which consisted of my mother, Sariah, and my elder brothers, 

29
0:3:20,556 --> 0:3:28,174
who were Laman, Lemuel, and Sam. 

30
0:3:28,174 --> 0:3:32,551
6 And it came to pass that when he had 

31
0:3:32,551 --> 0:3:36,927
traveled three days in the wilderness, he pitched his tent 

32
0:3:36,927 --> 0:3:41,303
in a valley by the side of a river of 

33
0:3:41,303 --> 0:3:45,68
water. 

34
0:3:45,68 --> 0:3:51,991
7 And it came to pass that he built an 

35
0:3:51,991 --> 0:3:58,302
altar of stones, and made an offering unto the Lord, 

36
0:3:58,302 --> 0:4:4,613
and gave thanks unto the Lord our God. 

37
0:4:4,613 --> 0:4:9,801
8 And it came to pass that he called the 

38
0:4:9,801 --> 0:4:14,988
name of the river, Laman, and it emptied into the 

39
0:4:14,988 --> 0:4:20,176
Red Sea; and the valley was in the borders near 

40
0:4:20,176 --> 0:4:25,364
the mouth thereof. 

41
0:4:25,364 --> 0:4:33,092
9 And when my father saw that the waters of 

42
0:4:33,092 --> 0:4:40,819
the river emptied into the fountain of the Red Sea, 

43
0:4:40,819 --> 0:4:48,547
he spake unto Laman, saying: O that thou mightest be 

44
0:4:48,547 --> 0:4:56,274
like unto this river, continually running into the fountain of 

45
0:4:56,274 --> 0:5:4,002
all righteousness! 

46
0:5:4,002 --> 0:5:11,606
10 And he also spake unto Lemuel: O that thou 

47
0:5:11,606 --> 0:5:19,209
mightest be like unto this valley, firm and steadfast, and 

48
0:5:19,209 --> 0:5:26,813
immovable in keeping the commandments of the Lord! 

49
0:5:26,813 --> 0:5:34,111
11 Now this he spake because of the stiffneckedness of 

50
0:5:34,111 --> 0:5:41,409
Laman and Lemuel; for behold they did murmur in many 

51
0:5:41,409 --> 0:5:48,707
things against their father, because he was a visionary man, 

52
0:5:48,707 --> 0:5:56,005
and had led them out of the land of Jerusalem, 

53
0:5:56,005 --> 0:6:3,303
to leave the land of their inheritance, and their gold, 

54
0:6:3,303 --> 0:6:10,601
and their silver, and their precious things, to perish in 

55
0:6:10,601 --> 0:6:17,899
the wilderness. And this they said he had done because 

56
0:6:17,899 --> 0:6:25,197
of the foolish imaginations of his heart. 

57
0:6:25,197 --> 0:6:32,119
12 And thus Laman and Lemuel, being the eldest, did 

58
0:6:32,119 --> 0:6:39,041
murmur against their father. And they did murmur because they 

59
0:6:39,041 --> 0:6:45,963
knew not the dealings of that God who had created 

60
0:6:45,963 --> 0:6:52,886
them. 

61
0:6:52,886 --> 0:6:58,185
13 Neither did they believe that Jerusalem, that great city, 

62
0:6:58,185 --> 0:7:3,484
could be destroyed according to the words of the prophets. 

63
0:7:3,484 --> 0:7:8,783
And they were like unto the Jews who were at 

64
0:7:8,783 --> 0:7:14,082
Jerusalem, who sought to take away the life of my 

65
0:7:14,082 --> 0:7:19,381
father. 

66
0:7:19,381 --> 0:7:25,447
14 And it came to pass that my father did 

67
0:7:25,447 --> 0:7:31,512
speak unto them in the valley of Lemuel, with power, 

68
0:7:31,512 --> 0:7:37,578
being filled with the Spirit, until their frames did shake 

69
0:7:37,578 --> 0:7:43,644
before him. And he did confound them, that they durst 

70
0:7:43,644 --> 0:7:49,71
not utter against him; wherefore, they did as he commanded 

71
0:7:49,71 --> 0:7:55,776
them. 

72
0:7:55,776 --> 0:8:3,459
15 And my father dwelt in a tent. 

73
0:8:3,459 --> 0:8:10,348
16 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, being 

74
0:8:10,348 --> 0:8:17,236
exceedingly young, nevertheless being large in stature, and also having 

75
0:8:17,236 --> 0:8:24,124
great desires to know of the mysteries of God, wherefore, 

76
0:8:24,124 --> 0:8:31,013
I did cry unto the Lord; and behold he did 

77
0:8:31,013 --> 0:8:37,901
visit me, and did soften my heart that I did 

78
0:8:37,901 --> 0:8:44,79
believe all the words which had been spoken by my 

79
0:8:44,79 --> 0:8:51,678
father; wherefore, I did not rebel against him like unto 

80
0:8:51,678 --> 0:8:58,567
my brothers. 

81
0:8:58,567 --> 0:9:3,012
17 And I spake unto Sam, making known unto him 

82
0:9:3,012 --> 0:9:7,458
the things which the Lord had manifested unto me by 

83
0:9:7,458 --> 0:9:11,903
his Holy Spirit. And it came to pass that he 

84
0:9:11,903 --> 0:9:16,349
believed in my words. 

85
0:9:16,349 --> 0:9:23,891
18 But, behold, Laman and Lemuel would not hearken unto 

86
0:9:23,891 --> 0:9:31,433
my words; and being grieved because of the hardness of 

87
0:9:31,433 --> 0:9:38,976
their hearts I cried unto the Lord for them. 

88
0:9:38,976 --> 0:9:54,174
19 And it came to pass that the Lord spake 

89
0:9:54,174 --> 0:10:9,372
unto me, saying: Blessed art thou, Nephi, because of thy 

90
0:10:9,372 --> 0:10:24,571
faith, for thou hast sought me diligently, with lowliness of 

91
0:10:24,571 --> 0:10:39,769
heart. 

92
0:10:39,769 --> 0:10:41,907
20 And inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye 

93
0:10:41,907 --> 0:10:44,044
shall prosper, and shall be led to a land of 

94
0:10:44,044 --> 0:10:46,182
promise; yea, even a land which I have prepared for 

95
0:10:46,182 --> 0:10:48,319
you; yea, a land which is choice above all other 

96
0:10:48,319 --> 0:10:50,456
lands. 

97
0:10:50,456 --> 0:10:55,098
21 And inasmuch as thy brethren shall rebel against thee, 

98
0:10:55,098 --> 0:10:59,739
they shall be cut off from the presence of the 

99
0:10:59,739 --> 0:11:4,381
Lord. 

100
0:11:4,381 --> 0:11:15,759
22 And inasmuch as thou shalt keep my commandments, thou 

101
0:11:15,759 --> 0:11:27,137
shalt be made a ruler and a teacher over thy 

102
0:11:27,137 --> 0:11:38,516
brethren. 

103
0:11:38,516 --> 0:11:43,137
23 For behold, in that day that they shall rebel 

104
0:11:43,137 --> 0:11:47,758
against me, I will curse them even with a sore 

105
0:11:47,758 --> 0:11:52,379
curse, and they shall have no power over thy seed 

106
0:11:52,379 --> 0:11:57,0
except they shall rebel against me also.
