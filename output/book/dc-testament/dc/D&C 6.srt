00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:20,261
Section 6 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet and 

2
00:00:20,261 --> 00:00:29,011
Oliver Cowdery, at Harmony, Pennsylvania, April 1829. Oliver Cowdery began 

3
00:00:29,011 --> 00:00:37,761
his labors as scribe in the translation of the Book 

4
00:00:37,761 --> 00:00:46,511
of Mormon, April 7, 1829. He had already received a 

5
00:00:46,511 --> 00:00:55,261
divine manifestation of the truth of the Prophet’s testimony respecting 

6
00:00:55,261 --> 00:01:04,011
the plates on which was engraved the Book of Mormon 

7
00:01:04,011 --> 00:01:12,761
record. The Prophet inquired of the Lord through the Urim 

8
00:01:12,761 --> 00:01:21,511
and Thummim and received this response. 
1–6, Laborers in the 

9
00:01:21,511 --> 00:01:30,261
Lord’s field gain salvation; 
7–13, There is no gift greater 

10
00:01:30,261 --> 00:01:39,011
than the gift of salvation; 
14–27, A witness of the 

11
00:01:39,011 --> 00:01:47,761
truth comes by the power of the Spirit; 
28–37, Look 

12
00:01:47,761 --> 00:01:56,511
unto Christ, and do good continually.  

13
00:01:56,683 --> 00:02:02,183
1 A great and marvelous work is about to come 

14
00:02:02,183 --> 00:02:07,683
forth unto the children of men. 

15
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:14,727
2 Behold, I am God; give heed unto my word, 

16
00:02:14,727 --> 00:02:22,227
which is quick and powerful, sharper than a two-edged sword, 

17
00:02:22,227 --> 00:02:29,727
to the dividing asunder of both joints and marrow; therefore 

18
00:02:29,727 --> 00:02:37,227
give heed unto my words. 

19
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:44,324
3 Behold, the field is white already to harvest; therefore, 

20
00:02:44,324 --> 00:02:50,924
whoso desireth to reap, let him thrust in his sickle 

21
00:02:50,924 --> 00:02:57,524
with his might, and reap while the day lasts, that 

22
00:02:57,524 --> 00:03:04,124
he may treasure up for his soul everlasting salvation in 

23
00:03:04,124 --> 00:03:10,724
the kingdom of God. 

24
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:15,223
4 Yea, whosoever will thrust in his sickle and reap, 

25
00:03:15,223 --> 00:03:20,223
the same is called of God. 

26
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:23,767
5 Therefore, if you will ask of me you shall 

27
00:03:23,767 --> 00:03:26,767
receive; if you will knock it shall be opened unto 

28
00:03:26,767 --> 00:03:29,767
you. 

29
00:03:29,81 --> 00:03:35,81
6 Now, as you have asked, behold, I say unto 

30
00:03:35,81 --> 00:03:41,81
you, keep my commandments, and seek to bring forth and 

31
00:03:41,81 --> 00:03:47,81
establish the cause of Zion; 

32
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:55,294
7 Seek not for riches but for wisdom, and behold, 

33
00:03:55,294 --> 00:04:02,794
the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto you, and 

34
00:04:02,794 --> 00:04:10,294
then shall you be made rich. Behold, he that hath 

35
00:04:10,294 --> 00:04:17,794
eternal life is rich. 

36
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:22,224
8 Verily, verily, I say unto you, even as you 

37
00:04:22,224 --> 00:04:26,724
desire of me so it shall be unto you; and 

38
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:31,224
if you desire, you shall be the means of doing 

39
00:04:31,224 --> 00:04:35,724
much good in this generation. 

40
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:42,575
9 Say nothing but repentance unto this generation; keep my 

41
00:04:42,575 --> 00:04:49,908
commandments, and assist to bring forth my work, according to 

42
00:04:49,908 --> 00:04:57,242
my commandments, and you shall be blessed. 

43
00:04:57,197 --> 00:05:01,864
10 Behold thou hast a gift, and blessed art thou 

44
00:05:01,864 --> 00:05:06,53
because of thy gift. Remember it is sacred and cometh 

45
00:05:06,53 --> 00:05:11,197
from above— 

46
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:18,511
11 And if thou wilt inquire, thou shalt know mysteries 

47
00:05:18,511 --> 00:05:25,311
which are great and marvelous; therefore thou shalt exercise thy 

48
00:05:25,311 --> 00:05:32,111
gift, that thou mayest find out mysteries, that thou mayest 

49
00:05:32,111 --> 00:05:38,911
bring many to the knowledge of the truth, yea, convince 

50
00:05:38,911 --> 00:05:45,711
them of the error of their ways. 

51
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:50,345
12 Make not thy gift known unto any save it 

52
00:05:50,345 --> 00:05:55,012
be those who are of thy faith. Trifle not with 

53
00:05:55,012 --> 00:05:59,679
sacred things. 

54
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:04,592
13 If thou wilt do good, yea, and hold out 

55
00:06:04,592 --> 00:06:09,992
faithful to the end, thou shalt be saved in the 

56
00:06:09,992 --> 00:06:15,392
kingdom of God, which is the greatest of all the 

57
00:06:15,392 --> 00:06:20,792
gifts of God; for there is no gift greater than 

58
00:06:20,792 --> 00:06:26,192
the gift of salvation. 

59
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:31,152
14 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, blessed art thou 

60
00:06:31,152 --> 00:06:36,152
for what thou hast done; for thou hast inquired of 

61
00:06:36,152 --> 00:06:41,152
me, and behold, as often as thou hast inquired thou 

62
00:06:41,152 --> 00:06:46,152
hast received instruction of my Spirit. If it had not 

63
00:06:46,152 --> 00:06:51,152
been so, thou wouldst not have come to the place 

64
00:06:51,152 --> 00:06:56,152
where thou art at this time. 

65
00:06:56,883 --> 00:07:02,883
15 Behold, thou knowest that thou hast inquired of me 

66
00:07:02,883 --> 00:07:08,883
and I did enlighten thy mind; and now I tell 

67
00:07:08,883 --> 00:07:14,883
thee these things that thou mayest know that thou hast 

68
00:07:14,883 --> 00:07:20,883
been enlightened by the Spirit of truth; 

69
00:07:20,34 --> 00:07:25,673
16 Yea, I tell thee, that thou mayest know that 

70
00:07:25,673 --> 00:07:31,007
there is none else save God that knowest thy thoughts 

71
00:07:31,007 --> 00:07:36,34
and the intents of thy heart. 

72
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:41,923
17 I tell thee these things as a witness unto 

73
00:07:41,923 --> 00:07:46,923
thee—that the words or the work which thou hast been 

74
00:07:46,923 --> 00:07:51,923
writing are true. 

75
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:56,104
18 Therefore be diligent; stand by my servant Joseph, faithfully, 

76
00:07:56,104 --> 00:08:00,771
in whatsoever difficult circumstances he may be for the word’s 

77
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:05,438
sake. 

78
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:11,418
19 Admonish him in his faults, and also receive admonition 

79
00:08:11,418 --> 00:08:17,418
of him. Be patient; be sober; be temperate; have patience, 

80
00:08:17,418 --> 00:08:23,418
faith, hope and charity. 

81
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:29,603
20 Behold, thou art Oliver, and I have spoken unto 

82
00:08:29,603 --> 00:08:35,803
thee because of thy desires; therefore treasure up these words 

83
00:08:35,803 --> 00:08:42,003
in thy heart. Be faithful and diligent in keeping the 

84
00:08:42,003 --> 00:08:48,203
commandments of God, and I will encircle thee in the 

85
00:08:48,203 --> 00:08:54,403
arms of my love. 

86
00:08:54,834 --> 00:09:01,334
21 Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God. 

87
00:09:01,334 --> 00:09:07,834
I am the same that came unto mine own, and 

88
00:09:07,834 --> 00:09:14,334
mine own received me not. I am the light which 

89
00:09:14,334 --> 00:09:20,834
shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehendeth it not. 

90
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:25,076
22 Verily, verily, I say unto you, if you desire 

91
00:09:25,076 --> 00:09:29,826
a further witness, cast your mind upon the night that 

92
00:09:29,826 --> 00:09:34,576
you cried unto me in your heart, that you might 

93
00:09:34,576 --> 00:09:39,326
know concerning the truth of these things. 

94
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:43,312
23 Did I not speak peace to your mind concerning 

95
00:09:43,312 --> 00:09:47,312
the matter? What greater witness can you have than from 

96
00:09:47,312 --> 00:09:51,312
God? 

97
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:59,325
24 And now, behold, you have received a witness; for 

98
00:09:59,325 --> 00:10:06,658
if I have told you things which no man knoweth 

99
00:10:06,658 --> 00:10:13,991
have you not received a witness? 

100
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:17,513
25 And, behold, I grant unto you a gift, if 

101
00:10:17,513 --> 00:10:21,513
you desire of me, to translate, even as my servant 

102
00:10:21,513 --> 00:10:25,513
Joseph. 

103
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:31,558
26 Verily, verily, I say unto you, that there are 

104
00:10:31,558 --> 00:10:37,558
records which contain much of my gospel, which have been 

105
00:10:37,558 --> 00:10:43,558
kept back because of the wickedness of the people; 

106
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:49,109
27 And now I command you, that if you have 

107
00:10:49,109 --> 00:10:55,109
good desires—a desire to lay up treasures for yourself in 

108
00:10:55,109 --> 00:11:01,109
heaven—then shall you assist in bringing to light, with your 

109
00:11:01,109 --> 00:11:07,109
gift, those parts of my scriptures which have been hidden 

110
00:11:07,109 --> 00:11:13,109
because of iniquity. 

111
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:21,106
28 And now, behold, I give unto you, and also 

112
00:11:21,106 --> 00:11:29,106
unto my servant Joseph, the keys of this gift, which 

113
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:37,106
shall bring to light this ministry; and in the mouth 

114
00:11:37,106 --> 00:11:45,106
of two or three witnesses shall every word be established. 

115
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:53,105
29 Verily, verily, I say unto you, if they reject 

116
00:11:53,105 --> 00:12:00,605
my words, and this part of my gospel and ministry, 

117
00:12:00,605 --> 00:12:08,105
blessed are ye, for they can do no more unto 

118
00:12:08,105 --> 00:12:15,605
you than unto me. 

119
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:22,201
30 And even if they do unto you even as 

120
00:12:22,201 --> 00:12:28,868
they have done unto me, blessed are ye, for you 

121
00:12:28,868 --> 00:12:35,535
shall dwell with me in glory. 

122
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:42,238
31 But if they reject not my words, which shall 

123
00:12:42,238 --> 00:12:48,988
be established by the testimony which shall be given, blessed 

124
00:12:48,988 --> 00:12:55,738
are they, and then shall ye have joy in the 

125
00:12:55,738 --> 00:13:02,488
fruit of your labors. 

126
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:07,949
32 Verily, verily, I say unto you, as I said 

127
00:13:07,949 --> 00:13:12,949
unto my disciples, where two or three are gathered together 

128
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:17,949
in my name, as touching one thing, behold, there will 

129
00:13:17,949 --> 00:13:22,949
I be in the midst of them—even so am I 

130
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:27,949
in the midst of you. 

131
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:35,34
33 Fear not to do good, my sons, for whatsoever 

132
00:13:35,34 --> 00:13:43,673
ye sow, that shall ye also reap; therefore, if ye 

133
00:13:43,673 --> 00:13:52,006
sow good ye shall also reap good for your reward. 

134
00:13:52,965 --> 00:14:02,965
34 Therefore, fear not, little flock; do good; let earth 

135
00:14:02,965 --> 00:14:12,965
and hell combine against you, for if ye are built 

136
00:14:12,965 --> 00:14:22,965
upon my rock, they cannot prevail. 

137
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:28,795
35 Behold, I do not condemn you; go your ways 

138
00:14:28,795 --> 00:14:35,128
and sin no more; perform with soberness the work which 

139
00:14:35,128 --> 00:14:41,462
I have commanded you. 

140
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:47,981
36 Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear 

141
00:14:47,981 --> 00:14:53,981
not. 

142
00:14:53,493 --> 00:15:01,493
37 Behold the wounds which pierced my side, and also 

143
00:15:01,493 --> 00:15:09,493
the prints of the nails in my hands and feet; 

144
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:17,493
be faithful, keep my commandments, and ye shall inherit the 

145
00:15:17,493 --> 00:15:25,493
kingdom of heaven. Amen.
