00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:50,819
The Doctrine and CovenantsSection 1 Revelation given through Joseph Smith 

2
00:00:50,819 --> 00:00:56,176
the Prophet, on November 1, 1831, during a special conference 

3
00:00:56,176 --> 00:01:01,534
of elders of the Church, held at Hiram, Ohio. Many 

4
00:01:01,534 --> 00:01:06,891
revelations had been received from the Lord prior to this 

5
00:01:06,891 --> 00:01:12,248
time, and the compilation of these for publication in book 

6
00:01:12,248 --> 00:01:17,605
form was one of the principal subjects passed upon at 

7
00:01:17,605 --> 00:01:22,962
the conference. This section constitutes the Lord’s preface to the 

8
00:01:22,962 --> 00:01:28,319
doctrines, covenants, and commandments given in this dispensation. 
1–7, The 

9
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:33,676
voice of warning is to all people; 
8–16, Apostasy and 

10
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:39,034
wickedness precede the Second Coming; 
17–23, Joseph Smith is called 

11
00:01:39,034 --> 00:01:44,391
to restore to earth the Lord’s truths and powers; 
24–33, 

12
00:01:44,391 --> 00:01:49,748
The Book of Mormon is brought forth and the true 

13
00:01:49,748 --> 00:01:55,105
Church is established; 
34–36, Peace will be taken from the 

14
00:01:55,105 --> 00:02:00,462
earth; 
37–39, Search these commandments.  

15
00:02:00,003 --> 00:02:06,003
1 Hearken, O ye people of my church, saith the 

16
00:02:06,003 --> 00:02:12,003
voice of him who dwells on high, and whose eyes 

17
00:02:12,003 --> 00:02:18,003
are upon all men; yea, verily I say: Hearken ye 

18
00:02:18,003 --> 00:02:24,003
people from afar; and ye that are upon the islands 

19
00:02:24,003 --> 00:02:30,003
of the sea, listen together. 

20
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:38,484
2 For verily the voice of the Lord is unto 

21
00:02:38,484 --> 00:02:45,984
all men, and there is none to escape; and there 

22
00:02:45,984 --> 00:02:53,484
is no eye that shall not see, neither ear that 

23
00:02:53,484 --> 00:03:00,984
shall not hear, neither heart that shall not be penetrated. 

24
00:03:00,964 --> 00:03:08,631
3 And the rebellious shall be pierced with much sorrow; 

25
00:03:08,631 --> 00:03:16,297
for their iniquities shall be spoken upon the housetops, and 

26
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:23,964
their secret acts shall be revealed. 

27
00:03:23,47 --> 00:03:29,47
4 And the voice of warning shall be unto all 

28
00:03:29,47 --> 00:03:35,47
people, by the mouths of my disciples, whom I have 

29
00:03:35,47 --> 00:03:41,47
chosen in these last days. 

30
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:50,488
5 And they shall go forth and none shall stay 

31
00:03:50,488 --> 00:03:58,988
them, for I the Lord have commanded them. 

32
00:03:58,555 --> 00:04:07,305
6 Behold, this is mine authority, and the authority of 

33
00:04:07,305 --> 00:04:16,055
my servants, and my preface unto the book of my 

34
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:24,805
commandments, which I have given them to publish unto you, 

35
00:04:24,805 --> 00:04:33,555
O inhabitants of the earth. 

36
00:04:33,59 --> 00:04:42,59
7 Wherefore, fear and tremble, O ye people, for what 

37
00:04:42,59 --> 00:04:51,59
I the Lord have decreed in them shall be fulfilled. 

38
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:58,591
8 And verily I say unto you, that they who 

39
00:04:58,591 --> 00:05:05,591
go forth, bearing these tidings unto the inhabitants of the 

40
00:05:05,591 --> 00:05:12,591
earth, to them is power given to seal both on 

41
00:05:12,591 --> 00:05:19,591
earth and in heaven, the unbelieving and rebellious; 

42
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:24,569
9 Yea, verily, to seal them up unto the day 

43
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:29,569
when the wrath of God shall be poured out upon 

44
00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:34,569
the wicked without measure— 

45
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:42,334
10 Unto the day when the Lord shall come to 

46
00:05:42,334 --> 00:05:50,584
recompense unto every man according to his work, and measure 

47
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:58,834
to every man according to the measure which he has 

48
00:05:58,834 --> 00:06:07,084
measured to his fellow man. 

49
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:12,951
11 Wherefore the voice of the Lord is unto the 

50
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:18,284
ends of the earth, that all that will hear may 

51
00:06:18,284 --> 00:06:23,617
hear: 

52
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:28,616
12 Prepare ye, prepare ye for that which is to 

53
00:06:28,616 --> 00:06:34,116
come, for the Lord is nigh; 

54
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:39,127
13 And the anger of the Lord is kindled, and 

55
00:06:39,127 --> 00:06:44,127
his sword is bathed in heaven, and it shall fall 

56
00:06:44,127 --> 00:06:49,127
upon the inhabitants of the earth. 

57
00:06:49,626 --> 00:06:57,026
14 And the arm of the Lord shall be revealed; 

58
00:06:57,026 --> 00:07:04,426
and the day cometh that they who will not hear 

59
00:07:04,426 --> 00:07:11,826
the voice of the Lord, neither the voice of his 

60
00:07:11,826 --> 00:07:19,226
servants, neither give heed to the words of the prophets 

61
00:07:19,226 --> 00:07:26,626
and apostles, shall be cut off from among the people; 

62
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:32,113
15 For they have strayed from mine ordinances, and have 

63
00:07:32,113 --> 00:07:37,613
broken mine everlasting covenant; 

64
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:45,291
16 They seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, 

65
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:52,957
but every man walketh in his own way, and after 

66
00:07:52,957 --> 00:08:00,624
the image of his own god, whose image is in 

67
00:08:00,624 --> 00:08:08,291
the likeness of the world, and whose substance is that 

68
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:15,957
of an idol, which waxeth old and shall perish in 

69
00:08:15,957 --> 00:08:23,624
Babylon, even Babylon the great, which shall fall. 

70
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:29,336
17 Wherefore, I the Lord, knowing the calamity which should 

71
00:08:29,336 --> 00:08:35,086
come upon the inhabitants of the earth, called upon my 

72
00:08:35,086 --> 00:08:40,836
servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and spake unto him from heaven, 

73
00:08:40,836 --> 00:08:46,586
and gave him commandments; 

74
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:55,259
18 And also gave commandments to others, that they should 

75
00:08:55,259 --> 00:09:03,926
proclaim these things unto the world; and all this that 

76
00:09:03,926 --> 00:09:12,593
it might be fulfilled, which was written by the prophets— 

77
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:22,085
19 The weak things of the world shall come forth 

78
00:09:22,085 --> 00:09:31,585
and break down the mighty and strong ones, that man 

79
00:09:31,585 --> 00:09:41,085
should not counsel his fellow man, neither trust in the 

80
00:09:41,085 --> 00:09:50,585
arm of flesh— 

81
00:09:50,607 --> 00:09:55,607
20 But that every man might speak in the name 

82
00:09:55,607 --> 00:10:00,607
of God the Lord, even the Savior of the world; 

83
00:10:00,617 --> 00:10:07,617
21 That faith also might increase in the earth; 

84
00:10:07,624 --> 00:10:13,624
22 That mine everlasting covenant might be established; 

85
00:10:13,63 --> 00:10:20,63
23 That the fulness of my gospel might be proclaimed 

86
00:10:20,63 --> 00:10:27,63
by the weak and the simple unto the ends of 

87
00:10:27,63 --> 00:10:34,63
the world, and before kings and rulers. 

88
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:40,384
24 Behold, I am God and have spoken it; these 

89
00:10:40,384 --> 00:10:46,134
commandments are of me, and were given unto my servants 

90
00:10:46,134 --> 00:10:51,884
in their weakness, after the manner of their language, that 

91
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:57,634
they might come to understanding. 

92
00:10:57,624 --> 00:11:09,624
25 And inasmuch as they erred it might be made 

93
00:11:09,624 --> 00:11:21,624
known; 

94
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:21,598
26 And inasmuch as they sought wisdom they might be 

95
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:21,598
instructed; 

96
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:21,598
27 And inasmuch as they sinned they might be chastened, 

97
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:21,598
that they might repent; 

98
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:24,598
28 And inasmuch as they were humble they might be 

99
00:11:24,598 --> 00:11:27,598
made strong, and blessed from on high, and receive knowledge 

100
00:11:27,598 --> 00:11:30,598
from time to time. 

101
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:35,156
29 And after having received the record of the Nephites, 

102
00:11:35,156 --> 00:11:40,156
yea, even my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., might have power 

103
00:11:40,156 --> 00:11:45,156
to translate through the mercy of God, by the power 

104
00:11:45,156 --> 00:11:50,156
of God, the Book of Mormon. 

105
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:56,428
30 And also those to whom these commandments were given, 

106
00:11:56,428 --> 00:12:02,714
might have power to lay the foundation of this church, 

107
00:12:02,714 --> 00:12:08,0
and to bring it forth out of obscurity and out 

108
00:12:08,0 --> 00:12:15,286
of darkness, the only true and living church upon the 

109
00:12:15,286 --> 00:12:21,571
face of the whole earth, with which I, the Lord, 

110
00:12:21,571 --> 00:12:27,857
am well pleased, speaking unto the church collectively and not 

111
00:12:27,857 --> 00:12:34,143
individually— 

112
00:12:34,704 --> 00:12:38,704
31 For I the Lord cannot look upon sin with 

113
00:12:38,704 --> 00:12:42,704
the least degree of allowance; 

114
00:12:42,211 --> 00:12:47,711
32 Nevertheless, he that repents and does the commandments of 

115
00:12:47,711 --> 00:12:53,211
the Lord shall be forgiven; 

116
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:58,489
33 And he that repents not, from him shall be 

117
00:12:58,489 --> 00:13:03,739
taken even the light which he has received; for my 

118
00:13:03,739 --> 00:13:08,989
Spirit shall not always strive with man, saith the Lord 

119
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:14,239
of Hosts. 

120
00:13:14,243 --> 00:13:19,91
34 And again, verily I say unto you, O inhabitants 

121
00:13:19,91 --> 00:13:25,577
of the earth: I the Lord am willing to make 

122
00:13:25,577 --> 00:13:31,243
these things known unto all flesh; 

123
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:36,477
35 For I am no respecter of persons, and will 

124
00:13:36,477 --> 00:13:41,677
that all men shall know that the day speedily cometh; 

125
00:13:41,677 --> 00:13:46,877
the hour is not yet, but is nigh at hand, 

126
00:13:46,877 --> 00:13:52,077
when peace shall be taken from the earth, and the 

127
00:13:52,077 --> 00:13:57,277
devil shall have power over his own dominion. 

128
00:13:57,787 --> 00:14:04,454
36 And also the Lord shall have power over his 

129
00:14:04,454 --> 00:14:11,12
saints, and shall reign in their midst, and shall come 

130
00:14:11,12 --> 00:14:17,787
down in judgment upon Idumea, or the world. 

131
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:25,19
37 Search these commandments, for they are true and faithful, 

132
00:14:25,19 --> 00:14:32,524
and the prophecies and promises which are in them shall 

133
00:14:32,524 --> 00:14:39,857
all be fulfilled. 

134
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:45,346
38 What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, 

135
00:14:45,346 --> 00:14:50,846
and I excuse not myself; and though the heavens and 

136
00:14:50,846 --> 00:14:56,346
the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away, 

137
00:14:56,346 --> 00:15:01,846
but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice 

138
00:15:01,846 --> 00:15:07,346
or by the voice of my servants, it is the 

139
00:15:07,346 --> 00:15:12,846
same. 

140
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:21,179
39 For behold, and lo, the Lord is God, and 

141
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:29,512
the Spirit beareth record, and the record is true, and 

142
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:37,845
the truth abideth forever and ever. Amen.
