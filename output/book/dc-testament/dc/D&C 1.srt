The Doctrine and CovenantsSection 1 Revelation given through Joseph Smith 

2
00:00:19,226 --> 00:00:26,94
the Prophet, on November 1, 1831, during a special conference 

3
00:00:26,94 --> 00:00:34,654
of elders of the Church, held at Hiram, Ohio. Many 

4
00:00:34,654 --> 00:00:42,369
revelations had been received from the Lord prior to this 

5
00:00:42,369 --> 00:00:50,083
time, and the compilation of these for publication in book 

6
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:57,797
form was one of the principal subjects passed upon at 

7
00:00:57,797 --> 00:01:05,511
the conference. This section constitutes the Lord’s preface to the 

8
00:01:05,511 --> 00:01:13,226
doctrines, covenants, and commandments given in this dispensation. 
1–7, The 

9
00:01:13,226 --> 00:01:20,94
voice of warning is to all people; 
8–16, Apostasy and 

10
00:01:20,94 --> 00:01:28,654
wickedness precede the Second Coming; 
17–23, Joseph Smith is called 

11
00:01:28,654 --> 00:01:36,369
to restore to earth the Lord’s truths and powers; 
24–33, 

12
00:01:36,369 --> 00:01:44,083
The Book of Mormon is brought forth and the true 

13
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:51,797
Church is established; 
34–36, Peace will be taken from the 

14
00:01:51,797 --> 00:01:59,511
earth; 
37–39, Search these commandments.  

15
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:05,786
Hearken, O ye people of my church, saith the voice 

16
00:02:05,786 --> 00:02:12,186
of him who dwells on high, and whose eyes are 

17
00:02:12,186 --> 00:02:18,586
upon all men; yea, verily I say: Hearken ye people 

18
00:02:18,586 --> 00:02:24,986
from afar; and ye that are upon the islands of 

19
00:02:24,986 --> 00:02:31,386
the sea, listen together. 

20
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:38,601
For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all 

21
00:02:38,601 --> 00:02:45,851
men, and there is none to escape; and there is 

22
00:02:45,851 --> 00:02:53,101
no eye that shall not see, neither ear that shall 

23
00:02:53,101 --> 00:03:00,351
not hear, neither heart that shall not be penetrated. 

24
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:08,514
And the rebellious shall be pierced with much sorrow; for 

25
00:03:08,514 --> 00:03:16,181
their iniquities shall be spoken upon the housetops, and their 

26
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:23,847
secret acts shall be revealed. 

27
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:30,17
And the voice of warning shall be unto all people, 

28
00:03:30,17 --> 00:03:36,504
by the mouths of my disciples, whom I have chosen 

29
00:03:36,504 --> 00:03:42,837
in these last days. 

30
00:03:42,372 --> 00:03:50,372
And they shall go forth and none shall stay them, 

31
00:03:50,372 --> 00:03:58,372
for I the Lord have commanded them. 

32
00:03:58,355 --> 00:04:07,105
Behold, this is mine authority, and the authority of my 

33
00:04:07,105 --> 00:04:15,855
servants, and my preface unto the book of my commandments, 

34
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:24,605
which I have given them to publish unto you, O 

35
00:04:24,605 --> 00:04:33,355
inhabitants of the earth. 

36
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:42,356
Wherefore, fear and tremble, O ye people, for what I 

37
00:04:42,356 --> 00:04:51,356
the Lord have decreed in them shall be fulfilled. 

38
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:58,124
And verily I say unto you, that they who go 

39
00:04:58,124 --> 00:05:04,874
forth, bearing these tidings unto the inhabitants of the earth, 

40
00:05:04,874 --> 00:05:11,624
to them is power given to seal both on earth 

41
00:05:11,624 --> 00:05:18,374
and in heaven, the unbelieving and rebellious; 

42
00:05:18,869 --> 00:05:23,869
Yea, verily, to seal them up unto the day when 

43
00:05:23,869 --> 00:05:28,869
the wrath of God shall be poured out upon the 

44
00:05:28,869 --> 00:05:33,869
wicked without measure— 

45
00:05:33,4 --> 00:05:41,9
Unto the day when the Lord shall come to recompense 

46
00:05:41,9 --> 00:05:50,4
unto every man according to his work, and measure to 

47
00:05:50,4 --> 00:05:58,9
every man according to the measure which he has measured 

48
00:05:58,9 --> 00:06:07,4
to his fellow man. 

49
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:15,401
Wherefore the voice of the Lord is unto the ends 

50
00:06:15,401 --> 00:06:22,901
of the earth, that all that will hear may hear: 

51
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:28,449
Prepare ye, prepare ye for that which is to come, 

52
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:33,949
for the Lord is nigh; 

53
00:06:33,96 --> 00:06:39,294
And the anger of the Lord is kindled, and his 

54
00:06:39,294 --> 00:06:44,627
sword is bathed in heaven, and it shall fall upon 

55
00:06:44,627 --> 00:06:49,96
the inhabitants of the earth. 

56
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:57,059
And the arm of the Lord shall be revealed; and 

57
00:06:57,059 --> 00:07:04,659
the day cometh that they who will not hear the 

58
00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:12,259
voice of the Lord, neither the voice of his servants, 

59
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:19,859
neither give heed to the words of the prophets and 

60
00:07:19,859 --> 00:07:27,459
apostles, shall be cut off from among the people; 

61
00:07:27,43 --> 00:07:32,43
For they have strayed from mine ordinances, and have broken 

62
00:07:32,43 --> 00:07:37,43
mine everlasting covenant; 

63
00:07:37,44 --> 00:07:45,107
They seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but 

64
00:07:45,107 --> 00:07:52,774
every man walketh in his own way, and after the 

65
00:07:52,774 --> 00:08:00,44
image of his own god, whose image is in the 

66
00:08:00,44 --> 00:08:08,107
likeness of the world, and whose substance is that of 

67
00:08:08,107 --> 00:08:15,774
an idol, which waxeth old and shall perish in Babylon, 

68
00:08:15,774 --> 00:08:23,44
even Babylon the great, which shall fall. 

69
00:08:23,92 --> 00:08:29,67
Wherefore, I the Lord, knowing the calamity which should come 

70
00:08:29,67 --> 00:08:35,42
upon the inhabitants of the earth, called upon my servant 

71
00:08:35,42 --> 00:08:41,17
Joseph Smith, Jun., and spake unto him from heaven, and 

72
00:08:41,17 --> 00:08:46,92
gave him commandments; 

73
00:08:46,476 --> 00:08:55,143
And also gave commandments to others, that they should proclaim 

74
00:08:55,143 --> 00:09:03,809
these things unto the world; and all this that it 

75
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:12,476
might be fulfilled, which was written by the prophets— 

76
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:20,969
The weak things of the world shall come forth and 

77
00:09:20,969 --> 00:09:29,469
break down the mighty and strong ones, that man should 

78
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:37,969
not counsel his fellow man, neither trust in the arm 

79
00:09:37,969 --> 00:09:46,469
of flesh— 

80
00:09:46,469 --> 00:09:53,469
But that every man might speak in the name of 

81
00:09:53,469 --> 00:10:00,469
God the Lord, even the Savior of the world; 

82
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:07,517
That faith also might increase in the earth; 

83
00:10:07,54 --> 00:10:13,54
That mine everlasting covenant might be established; 

84
00:10:13,563 --> 00:10:20,563
That the fulness of my gospel might be proclaimed by 

85
00:10:20,563 --> 00:10:27,563
the weak and the simple unto the ends of the 

86
00:10:27,563 --> 00:10:34,563
world, and before kings and rulers. 

87
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:40,317
Behold, I am God and have spoken it; these commandments 

88
00:10:40,317 --> 00:10:46,067
are of me, and were given unto my servants in 

89
00:10:46,067 --> 00:10:51,817
their weakness, after the manner of their language, that they 

90
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:57,567
might come to understanding. 

91
00:10:57,557 --> 00:11:21,557
And inasmuch as they erred it might be made known; 

92
00:11:21,531 --> 00:11:21,531
And inasmuch as they sought wisdom they might be instructed; 

93
00:11:21,531 --> 00:11:21,531
And inasmuch as they sinned they might be chastened, that 

94
00:11:21,531 --> 00:11:21,531
they might repent; 

95
00:11:21,531 --> 00:11:24,531
And inasmuch as they were humble they might be made 

96
00:11:24,531 --> 00:11:27,531
strong, and blessed from on high, and receive knowledge from 

97
00:11:27,531 --> 00:11:30,531
time to time. 

98
00:11:30,573 --> 00:11:35,573
And after having received the record of the Nephites, yea, 

99
00:11:35,573 --> 00:11:40,573
even my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., might have power to 

100
00:11:40,573 --> 00:11:45,573
translate through the mercy of God, by the power of 

101
00:11:45,573 --> 00:11:50,573
God, the Book of Mormon. 

102
00:11:50,093 --> 00:11:57,593
And also those to whom these commandments were given, might 

103
00:11:57,593 --> 00:12:05,093
have power to lay the foundation of this church, and 

104
00:12:05,093 --> 00:12:12,593
to bring it forth out of obscurity and out of 

105
00:12:12,593 --> 00:12:20,093
darkness, the only true and living church upon the face 

106
00:12:20,093 --> 00:12:27,593
of the whole earth, with which I, the Lord, am 

107
00:12:27,593 --> 00:12:35,093
well pleased, speaking unto the church collectively and not individually— 

108
00:12:35,104 --> 00:12:38,604
For I the Lord cannot look upon sin with the 

109
00:12:38,604 --> 00:12:42,104
least degree of allowance; 

110
00:12:42,612 --> 00:12:48,112
Nevertheless, he that repents and does the commandments of the 

111
00:12:48,112 --> 00:12:53,612
Lord shall be forgiven; 

112
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:58,389
And he that repents not, from him shall be taken 

113
00:12:58,389 --> 00:13:03,639
even the light which he has received; for my Spirit 

114
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:08,889
shall not always strive with man, saith the Lord of 

115
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:14,139
Hosts. 

116
00:13:14,16 --> 00:13:19,493
And again, verily I say unto you, O inhabitants of 

117
00:13:19,493 --> 00:13:24,827
the earth: I the Lord am willing to make these 

118
00:13:24,827 --> 00:13:30,16
things known unto all flesh; 

119
00:13:30,71 --> 00:13:36,11
For I am no respecter of persons, and will that 

120
00:13:36,11 --> 00:13:41,51
all men shall know that the day speedily cometh; the 

121
00:13:41,51 --> 00:13:46,91
hour is not yet, but is nigh at hand, when 

122
00:13:46,91 --> 00:13:52,31
peace shall be taken from the earth, and the devil 

123
00:13:52,31 --> 00:13:57,71
shall have power over his own dominion. 

124
00:13:57,704 --> 00:14:04,704
And also the Lord shall have power over his saints, 

125
00:14:04,704 --> 00:14:11,704
and shall reign in their midst, and shall come down 

126
00:14:11,704 --> 00:14:18,704
in judgment upon Idumea, or the world. 

127
00:14:18,241 --> 00:14:25,241
Search these commandments, for they are true and faithful, and 

128
00:14:25,241 --> 00:14:32,241
the prophecies and promises which are in them shall all 

129
00:14:32,241 --> 00:14:39,241
be fulfilled. 

130
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:46,546
What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and 

131
00:14:46,546 --> 00:14:53,346
I excuse not myself; and though the heavens and the 

132
00:14:53,346 --> 00:15:00,146
earth pass away, my word shall not pass away, but 

133
00:15:00,146 --> 00:15:06,946
shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or 

134
00:15:06,946 --> 00:15:13,746
by the voice of my servants, it is the same. 

135
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:21,246
For behold, and lo, the Lord is God, and the 

136
00:15:21,246 --> 00:15:29,246
Spirit beareth record, and the record is true, and the 

137
00:15:29,246 --> 00:15:37,246
truth abideth forever and ever. Amen.
