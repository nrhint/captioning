00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:22,011
Section 7 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet and 

2
00:00:22,011 --> 00:00:32,511
Oliver Cowdery, at Harmony, Pennsylvania, April 1829, when they inquired 

3
00:00:32,511 --> 00:00:43,011
through the Urim and Thummim as to whether John, the 

4
00:00:43,011 --> 00:00:53,511
beloved disciple, tarried in the flesh or had died. The 

5
00:00:53,511 --> 00:01:04,011
revelation is a translated version of the record made on 

6
00:01:04,011 --> 00:01:14,511
parchment by John and hidden up by himself. 
1–3, John 

7
00:01:14,511 --> 00:01:25,011
the Beloved will live until the Lord comes; 
4–8, Peter, 

8
00:01:25,011 --> 00:01:35,511
James, and John hold gospel keys.  

9
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:41,562
1 And the Lord said unto me: John, my beloved, 

10
00:01:41,562 --> 00:01:47,229
what desirest thou? For if you shall ask what you 

11
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:52,896
will, it shall be granted unto you. 

12
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:56,913
2 And I said unto him: Lord, give unto me 

13
00:01:56,913 --> 00:02:00,913
power over death, that I may live and bring souls 

14
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:04,913
unto thee. 

15
00:02:04,908 --> 00:02:10,658
3 And the Lord said unto me: Verily, verily, I 

16
00:02:10,658 --> 00:02:16,408
say unto thee, because thou desirest this thou shalt tarry 

17
00:02:16,408 --> 00:02:22,158
until I come in my glory, and shalt prophesy before 

18
00:02:22,158 --> 00:02:27,908
nations, kindreds, tongues and people. 

19
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:34,298
4 And for this cause the Lord said unto Peter: 

20
00:02:34,298 --> 00:02:40,698
If I will that he tarry till I come, what 

21
00:02:40,698 --> 00:02:47,098
is that to thee? For he desired of me that 

22
00:02:47,098 --> 00:02:53,498
he might bring souls unto me, but thou desiredst that 

23
00:02:53,498 --> 00:02:59,898
thou mightest speedily come unto me in my kingdom. 

24
00:02:59,88 --> 00:03:04,88
5 I say unto thee, Peter, this was a good 

25
00:03:04,88 --> 00:03:09,88
desire; but my beloved has desired that he might do 

26
00:03:09,88 --> 00:03:14,88
more, or a greater work yet among men than what 

27
00:03:14,88 --> 00:03:19,88
he has before done. 

28
00:03:19,9 --> 00:03:26,4
6 Yea, he has undertaken a greater work; therefore I 

29
00:03:26,4 --> 00:03:32,9
will make him as flaming fire and a ministering angel; 

30
00:03:32,9 --> 00:03:39,4
he shall minister for those who shall be heirs of 

31
00:03:39,4 --> 00:03:45,9
salvation who dwell on the earth. 

32
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:51,459
7 And I will make thee to minister for him 

33
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:56,959
and for thy brother James; and unto you three I 

34
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,459
will give this power and the keys of this ministry 

35
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:07,959
until I come. 

36
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:13,847
8 Verily I say unto you, ye shall both have 

37
00:04:13,847 --> 00:04:20,181
according to your desires, for ye both joy in that 

38
00:04:20,181 --> 00:04:26,514
which ye have desired.
