unto him a book, and bade him   
that he should read.

unto him a book, and bade him   
that he should read.            
12 And it came to pass that as  

117
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:26,998

Spirit of the Lord.             
13 And he read, saying: Wo, wo, 
unto Jerusalem, for I have seen 

121
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:45,349
13 And he read, saying: Wo, wo, 
unto Jerusalem, for I have seen 
thine abominations! Yea, and    

122
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:48,352
unto Jerusalem, for I have seen 
thine abominations! Yea, and    
many things did my father read  

123
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:53,324
thine abominations! Yea, and    
many things did my father read  
concerning Jerusalem--that it   

124
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:56,227
many things did my father read  
concerning Jerusalem--that it   
should be destroyed, and the

00:09:56,229 --> 00:10:01,432
concerning Jerusalem--that it   
should be destroyed, and the    
inhabitants thereof; many should

126
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:04,368
should be destroyed, and the    
inhabitants thereof; many should
perish by the sword, and many   

127
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:09,741
inhabitants thereof; many should
perish by the sword, and many   
should be carried away captive

00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:14,512
perish by the sword, and many   
should be carried away captive  
into Babylon.                   

129
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:18,816
should be carried away captive  
into Babylon.

130
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:21,619
into Babylon.                   
14 And it came to pass that when
my father had read and seen many

14 And it came to pass that when
my father had read and seen many
great and marvelous things, he  

132
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:29,493
my father had read and seen many
great and marvelous things, he

did exclaim many things unto the
Lord; such as: Great and

did exclaim many things unto the
Lord; such as: Great and        
marvelous are thy works, O Lord 

135
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:39,470
Lord; such as: Great and        
marvelous are thy works, O Lord 
God Almighty! Thy throne is high

00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:43,207
marvelous are thy works, O Lord 
God Almighty! Thy throne is high
in the heavens, and thy power,  

137
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:47,645
God Almighty! Thy throne is high
in the heavens, and thy power,  
and goodness, and mercy are over

138
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:51,115

and goodness, and mercy are over
all the inhabitants of the      

139
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:55,519
and goodness, and mercy are over
all the inhabitants of the      
earth; and, because thou art    

140
00:10:55,521 --> 00:11:02,526
all the inhabitants of the      
earth; and, because thou art    
merciful, thou wilt not suffer  

141
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:10,101
earth; and, because thou art    
merciful, thou wilt not suffer  
those who come unto thee that   

142
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:18,176
merciful, thou wilt not suffer  
those who come unto thee that   
they shall perish!              

143
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:24,082
those who come unto thee that   
they shall perish!              
15 And after this manner was the

144
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:30,955
they shall perish!              
15 And after this manner was the
language of my father in the    

145
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:34,025
15 And after this manner was the
language of my father in the    
praising of his God; for his    

146
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,227
language of my father in the    
praising of his God; for his    
soul did rejoice, and his whole 

147
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:40,064
praising of his God; for his    
soul did rejoice, and his whole 
heart was filled, because of the

148
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:44,668
soul did rejoice, and his whole 
heart was filled, because of the
things which he had seen, yea,  

149
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:48,439
heart was filled, because of the
things which he had seen, yea,  
which the Lord had shown unto   

150
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:53,144
things which he had seen, yea,  
which the Lord had shown unto   
him.                            

151
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:57,548
which the Lord had shown unto   
him.                            
16 And now I, Nephi, do not make

152
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,753
him.                            
16 And now I, Nephi, do not make
a full account of the things    

153
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:06,490
16 And now I, Nephi, do not make
a full account of the things    
which my father hath written,   

154
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:11,629
a full account of the things    
which my father hath written,   
for he hath written many things 

155
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:18,169
which my father hath written,   
for he hath written many things 
which he saw in visions and in  

156
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:25,209
for he hath written many things 
which he saw in visions and in  
dreams; and he also hath written

157
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:27,711
which he saw in visions and in  
dreams; and he also hath written
many things which he prophesied 

158
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:31,883
dreams; and he also hath written
many things which he prophesied 
and spake unto his children, of 

159
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:35,486
many things which he prophesied 
and spake unto his children, of 
which I shall not make a full   

160
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,521
and spake unto his children, of 
which I shall not make a full   
account.                        

161
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:41,192
which I shall not make a full   
account.                        
17 But I shall make an account  

162
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:44,662
account.                        
17 But I shall make an account  
of my proceedings in my days.   

163
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:48,465
17 But I shall make an account  
of my proceedings in my days.   
Behold, I make an abridgment of 

164
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:53,171
of my proceedings in my days.   
Behold, I make an abridgment of 
the record of my father, upon   

165
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:56,174
Behold, I make an abridgment of 
the record of my father, upon   
plates which I have made with   

166
00:12:56,176 --> 00:13:00,278
the record of my father, upon   
plates which I have made with   
mine own hands; wherefore, after

167
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,614
plates which I have made with   
mine own hands; wherefore, after
I have abridged the record of my

168
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:07,418
mine own hands; wherefore, after
I have abridged the record of my
father then will I make an      

169
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,821
I have abridged the record of my
father then will I make an      
account of mine own life.       

170
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:13,757
father then will I make an      
account of mine own life.       
18 Therefore, I would that ye   

171
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:17,695
account of mine own life.       
18 Therefore, I would that ye   
should know, that after the Lord

172
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:21,899
18 Therefore, I would that ye   
should know, that after the Lord
had shown so many marvelous     

173
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:28,239
should know, that after the Lord
had shown so many marvelous     
things unto my father, Lehi,    

174
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:33,177
had shown so many marvelous     
things unto my father, Lehi,    
yea, concerning the destruction 

175
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:35,913
things unto my father, Lehi,    
yea, concerning the destruction 
of Jerusalem, behold he went    

176
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:38,582
yea, concerning the destruction 
of Jerusalem, behold he went    
forth among the people, and     

177
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:40,517
of Jerusalem, behold he went    
forth among the people, and     
began to prophesy and to declare

178
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:43,020
forth among the people, and     
began to prophesy and to declare
unto them concerning the things 

179
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:44,989
began to prophesy and to declare
unto them concerning the things 
which he had both seen and      

180
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,325
unto them concerning the things 
which he had both seen and      
heard.                          

181
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:50,761
which he had both seen and      
heard.                          
19 And it came to pass that the 

182
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:53,831

Jews did mock him because of the
things which he testified of    

184
00:13:56,769 --> 00:14:00,537
Jews did mock him because of the
things which he testified of    
them; for he truly testified of 

185
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:05,877
things which he testified of    
them; for he truly testified of 
their wickedness and their      

186
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:11,715
them; for he truly testified of 
their wickedness and their      
abominations; and he testified  

187
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:15,619
their wickedness and their      
abominations; and he testified  
that the things which he saw and

abominations; and he testified  
that the things which he saw and
heard, and also the things which

he read in the book, manifested 
plainly of the coming of a

194
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:47,285
of the world.                   
20 And when the Jews heard these
things they were angry with him;

195
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:51,488
20 And when the Jews heard these
things they were angry with him;
yea, even as with the prophets  

196
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,392

yea, even as with the prophets  
of old, whom they had cast out,

00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:58,495
yea, even as with the prophets  
of old, whom they had cast out, 
and stoned, and slain; and they 

198
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:07,338
of old, whom they had cast out, 
and stoned, and slain; and they 
also sought his life, that they

also sought his life, that they 
might take it away. But behold,

might take it away. But behold, 
I, Nephi, will show unto you

Sea, he spake unto Laman,       
saying: O that thou mightest be 
like unto this river,           

276
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:47,578
saying: O that thou mightest be 
like unto this river,           
continually running into the    

277
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:56,887
like unto this river,           
continually running into the    
fountain of all righteousness!  

278
00:20:56,889 --> 00:21:00,924
continually running into the    
fountain of all righteousness!

00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:08,365
10 And he also spake unto       
Lemuel: O that thou mightest be 
like unto this valley, firm and 

281
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:11,134
Lemuel: O that thou mightest be 
like unto this valley, firm and 
steadfast, and immovable in     

282
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:13,870
like unto this valley, firm and 
steadfast, and immovable in     
keeping the commandments of the 

283
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:18,975
steadfast, and immovable in     
keeping the commandments of the 
Lord!                           

284
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:22,946
keeping the commandments of the 
Lord!                           
11 Now this he spake because of 

285
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:28,852
Lord!                           
11 Now this he spake because of 
the stiffneckedness of Laman and

286
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:32,889
11 Now this he spake because of 
the stiffneckedness of Laman and
Lemuel; for behold they did     

287
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:36,126
the stiffneckedness of Laman and
Lemuel; for behold they did     
murmur in many things against   

288
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:40,130
Lemuel; for behold they did     
murmur in many things against   
their father, because he was a  

289
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:44,935
murmur in many things against   
their father, because he was a  
visionary man, and had led them 

290
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:49,906
their father, because he was a  
visionary man, and had led them 
out of the land of Jerusalem, to

291
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:53,243
visionary man, and had led them 
out of the land of Jerusalem, to
leave the land of their         

292
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:55,779
out of the land of Jerusalem, to
leave the land of their         
inheritance, and their gold, and

293
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:59,650
leave the land of their         
inheritance, and their gold, and
their silver, and their precious

294
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:02,553
inheritance, and their gold, and
their silver, and their precious
things, to perish in the        

295
00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:07,891
their silver, and their precious
things, to perish in the        
wilderness. And this they said  

296
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:11,662
things, to perish in the        
wilderness. And this they said  
he had done because of the      

297
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:14,765
wilderness. And this they said  
he had done because of the      
foolish imaginations of his     

298
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:17,468
he had done because of the      
foolish imaginations of his     
heart.                          

299
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:22,305
foolish imaginations of his     
heart.                          
12 And thus Laman and Lemuel,   

300
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:25,609
heart.                          
12 And thus Laman and Lemuel,   
being the eldest, did murmur    

301
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:29,246
12 And thus Laman and Lemuel,   
being the eldest, did murmur    
against their father. And they  

302
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:33,116
being the eldest, did murmur    
against their father. And they  
did murmur because they knew not

303
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:37,254
against their father. And they  
did murmur because they knew not
the dealings of that God who had

304
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:43,794
did murmur because they knew not
the dealings of that God who had
created them.                   

305
00:22:43,796 --> 00:22:47,631
the dealings of that God who had
created them.                   
13 Neither did they believe that

306
00:22:47,633 --> 00:22:51,301
created them.                   
13 Neither did they believe that
Jerusalem, that great city,     

307
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:54,405
13 Neither did they believe that
Jerusalem, that great city,     
could be destroyed according to 

308
00:22:54,407 --> 00:22:59,109
Jerusalem, that great city,     
could be destroyed according to 
the words of the prophets. And  

309
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:02,913
could be destroyed according to 
the words of the prophets. And  
they were like unto the Jews who

310
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:07,785
the words of the prophets. And  
they were like unto the Jews who
were at Jerusalem, who sought to

311
00:23:07,787 --> 00:23:10,186
they were like unto the Jews who
were at Jerusalem, who sought to
take away the life of my father.

312
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:13,791
were at Jerusalem, who sought to
take away the life of my father.
14 And it came to pass that my  

313
00:23:13,793 --> 00:23:19,329
take away the life of my father.
14 And it came to pass that my  
father did speak unto them in   

314
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:21,364
14 And it came to pass that my  
father did speak unto them in   
the valley of Lemuel, with      

315
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:25,669
father did speak unto them in   
the valley of Lemuel, with      
power, being filled with the    

316
00:23:25,671 --> 00:23:29,640
the valley of Lemuel, with      
power, being filled with the    
Spirit, until their frames did  

317
00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:34,177
power, being filled with the    
Spirit, until their frames did  
shake before him. And he did    

318
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:37,213
Spirit, until their frames did  
shake before him. And he did    
confound them, that they durst  

319
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:42,118
shake before him. And he did    
confound them, that they durst  
not utter against him;          

320
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,654
confound them, that they durst  
not utter against him;          
wherefore, they did as he       

321
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:45,556
not utter against him;          
wherefore, they did as he       
commanded them.                 

322
00:23:45,558 --> 00:23:47,925
wherefore, they did as he       
commanded them.                 
15 And my father dwelt in a     

323
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:52,896
commanded them.                 
15 And my father dwelt in a     
tent.                           

324
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:56,066
15 And my father dwelt in a     
tent.                           
16 And it came to pass that I,  

325
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:59,269
tent.                           
16 And it came to pass that I,  
Nephi, being exceedingly young, 

326
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:04,074
16 And it came to pass that I,  
Nephi, being exceedingly young, 
nevertheless being large in     

327
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:08,712
Nephi, being exceedingly young, 
nevertheless being large in     
stature, and also having great  

328
00:24:08,714 --> 00:24:13,316
nevertheless being large in     
stature, and also having great  
desires to know of the mysteries

329
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:17,754
stature, and also having great  
desires to know of the mysteries
of God, wherefore, I did cry    

330
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:20,557
desires to know of the mysteries
of God, wherefore, I did cry    
unto the Lord; and behold he did

331
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,628
of God, wherefore, I did cry    
unto the Lord; and behold he did
visit me, and did soften my     

332
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:29,432
unto the Lord; and behold he did
visit me, and did soften my     
heart that I did believe all the

333
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:34,538
visit me, and did soften my     
heart that I did believe all the
words which had been spoken by  

334
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:38,909
heart that I did believe all the
words which had been spoken by  
my father; wherefore, I did not 

335
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:42,679
words which had been spoken by  
my father; wherefore, I did not 
rebel against him like unto my  

336
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:46,750
my father; wherefore, I did not 
rebel against him like unto my  
brothers.                       

337
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:49,586
rebel against him like unto my  
brothers.                       
17 And I spake unto Sam, making 

338
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:53,590
brothers.                       
17 And I spake unto Sam, making 
known unto him the things which 

339
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:58,762
17 And I spake unto Sam, making 
known unto him the things which 
the Lord had manifested unto me 

340
00:24:58,764 --> 00:25:01,665
known unto him the things which 
the Lord had manifested unto me 
by his Holy Spirit. And it came 

341
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:02,699
the Lord had manifested unto me 
by his Holy Spirit. And it came 
to pass that he believed in my  

342
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:05,235
by his Holy Spirit. And it came 
to pass that he believed in my  
words.                          

343
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:09,072
to pass that he believed in my  
words.                          
18 But, behold, Laman and Lemuel

344
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:12,142
words.                          
18 But, behold, Laman and Lemuel
would not hearken unto my words;

345
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:17,213
18 But, behold, Laman and Lemuel
would not hearken unto my words;
and being grieved because of the

346
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:22,252
would not hearken unto my words;
and being grieved because of the
hardness of their hearts I cried

347
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:25,355
and being grieved because of the
hardness of their hearts I cried
unto the Lord for them.         

348
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:29,993
hardness of their hearts I cried
unto the Lord for them.         
19 And it came to pass that the 

349
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:32,195
unto the Lord for them.         
19 And it came to pass that the 
Lord spake unto me, saying:     

350
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:36,833
19 And it came to pass that the 
Lord spake unto me, saying:     
Blessed art thou, Nephi, because

351
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:41,371
Lord spake unto me, saying:     
Blessed art thou, Nephi, because
of thy faith, for thou hast     

352
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:47,010
Blessed art thou, Nephi, because
of thy faith, for thou hast     
sought me diligently, with      

353
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:51,214
of thy faith, for thou hast     
sought me diligently, with      
lowliness of heart.             

354
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:54,517
sought me diligently, with      
lowliness of heart.             
20 And inasmuch as ye shall keep

355
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:57,621
lowliness of heart.             
20 And inasmuch as ye shall keep
my commandments, ye shall

prosper, and shall be led to a  
land of promise; yea, even a    

358
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:11,868
prosper, and shall be led to a  
land of promise; yea, even a    
land which I have prepared for  

359
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:16,306
land of promise; yea, even a    
land which I have prepared for  
you; yea, a land which is choice

360
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:23,213
land which I have prepared for  
you; yea, a land which is choice
above all other lands.          

361
00:26:23,215 --> 00:26:26,083
you; yea, a land which is choice
above all other lands.          
21 And inasmuch as thy brethren 

362
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:29,853
above all other lands.          
21 And inasmuch as thy brethren 
shall rebel against thee, they  

363
00:26:29,855 --> 00:26:33,023
21 And inasmuch as thy brethren 
shall rebel against thee, they  
shall be cut off from the       

364
00:26:33,025 --> 00:26:35,626
shall rebel against thee, they  
shall be cut off from the       
presence of the Lord.           

365
00:26:35,628 --> 00:26:39,329
shall be cut off from the       
presence of the Lord.           
22 And inasmuch as thou shalt

presence of the Lord.           
22 And inasmuch as thou shalt   
keep my commandments, thou shalt

367
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:44,601
22 And inasmuch as thou shalt   
keep my commandments, thou shalt
be made a ruler and a teacher   

368
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:49,339
keep my commandments, thou shalt
be made a ruler and a teacher   
over thy brethren.              

369
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:51,708
be made a ruler and a teacher   
over thy brethren.

23 For behold, in that day that 
they shall rebel against me, I  
will curse them even with a sore

they shall rebel against me, I  
will curse them even with a sore
curse, and they shall have no

00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:09,126
will curse them even with a sore
curse, and they shall have no   
power over thy seed except they

curse, and they shall have no   
power over thy seed except they 
shall rebel against me also.

power over thy seed except they 
shall rebel against me also.    
24 And if it so be that they

rebel against me, they shall be 
a scourge unto thy seed, to stir

a scourge unto thy seed, to stir
them up in the ways of          
remembrance.

5 And now, behold thy brothers  
murmur, saying it is a hard     

410
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:09,339
5 And now, behold thy brothers  
murmur, saying it is a hard     
thing which I have required of  

411
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:12,242
murmur, saying it is a hard     
thing which I have required of  
them; but behold I have not     

412
00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:16,313
thing which I have required of  
them; but behold I have not     
required it of them, but it is a

413
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:19,415
them; but behold I have not     
required it of them, but it is a
commandment of the Lord.        

414
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:22,485
required it of them, but it is a
commandment of the Lord.        
6 Therefore go, my son, and thou

415
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,355
commandment of the Lord.        
6 Therefore go, my son, and thou
shalt be favored of the Lord,   

416

shalt be favored of the Lord,   
because thou hast not murmured. 
7 And it came to pass that I,   

418
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:39,035
because thou hast not murmured. 
7 And it came to pass that I,

00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:47,277

will go and do the things which 
the Lord hath commanded, for I  

421
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,713
will go and do the things which 
the Lord hath commanded, for I  
know that the Lord giveth no    

422
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:54,317
the Lord hath commanded, for I  
know that the Lord giveth no    
commandments unto the children  

423
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:57,888
know that the Lord giveth no    
commandments unto the children  
of men, save he shall prepare a 

424
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:01,124
commandments unto the children  
of men, save he shall prepare a 
way for them that they may
