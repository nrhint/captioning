1
00:00:09,026 --> 00:00:21,901
Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, on November 1, 

2
00:00:21,901 --> 00:00:34,776
1831, during a special conference of elders of the Church, 

3
00:00:34,776 --> 00:00:47,651
held at Hiram, Ohio. Many revelations had been received from 

4
00:00:47,651 --> 00:01:00,526
the Lord prior to this time, and the compilation of 

5
00:01:00,526 --> 00:01:13,401
these for publication in book form was one of the 

6
00:01:13,401 --> 00:01:26,276
principal subjects passed upon at the conference. This section constitutes 

7
00:01:26,276 --> 00:01:39,151
the Lord’s preface to the doctrines, covenants, and commandments given 

8
00:01:39,151 --> 00:01:52,026
in this dispensation. 

9
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:59,513
aHearken, O ye people of my bchurch, saith the voice 

10
00:01:59,513 --> 00:02:06,113
of him who dwells on high, and whose ceyes are 

11
00:02:06,113 --> 00:02:12,713
upon all men; yea, verily I say: Hearken ye people 

12
00:02:12,713 --> 00:02:19,313
from afar; and ye that are upon the islands of 

13
00:02:19,313 --> 00:02:25,913
the sea, listen together. 

14
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:34,662
For verily the avoice of the Lord is unto all 

15
00:02:34,662 --> 00:02:43,412
men, and there is none to bescape; and there is 

16
00:02:43,412 --> 00:02:52,162
no eye that shall not see, neither cear that shall 

17
00:02:52,162 --> 00:03:00,912
not hear, neither dheart that shall not be penetrated. 

18
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:06,614
And the arebellious shall be bpierced with much csorrow; for 

19
00:03:06,614 --> 00:03:12,281
their iniquities shall be dspoken upon the housetops, and their 

20
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:17,947
secret acts shall be revealed. 

21
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:23,631
And the avoice of warning shall be unto all people, 

22
00:03:23,631 --> 00:03:29,298
by the mouths of my disciples, whom I have bchosen 

23
00:03:29,298 --> 00:03:34,964
in these clast days. 

24
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:46,981
And they shall ago forth and none shall stay them, 

25
00:03:46,981 --> 00:03:58,981
for I the Lord have commanded them. 

26
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:06,788
Behold, this is mine aauthority, and the authority of my 

27
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:15,038
servants, and my preface unto the book of my bcommandments, 

28
00:04:15,038 --> 00:04:23,288
which I have given them to cpublish unto you, O 

29
00:04:23,288 --> 00:04:31,538
dinhabitants of the earth. 

30
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:40,038
Wherefore, afear and btremble, O ye people, for what I 

31
00:04:40,038 --> 00:04:48,538
the Lord have cdecreed in them shall be dfulfilled. 

32
00:04:48,605 --> 00:04:54,855
And verily I say unto you, that they who go 

33
00:04:54,855 --> 00:05:01,105
forth, bearing these tidings unto the inhabitants of the earth, 

34
00:05:01,105 --> 00:05:07,355
to them is power given to aseal both on earth 

35
00:05:07,355 --> 00:05:13,605
and in heaven, the unbelieving and brebellious; 

36
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:19,28
Yea, verily, to seal them up unto the aday when 

37
00:05:19,28 --> 00:05:24,947
the bwrath of God shall be poured out upon the 

38
00:05:24,947 --> 00:05:30,613
cwicked without measure— 

39
00:05:30,63 --> 00:05:38,88
Unto the aday when the Lord shall come to brecompense 

40
00:05:38,88 --> 00:05:47,13
unto every man according to his cwork, and dmeasure to 

41
00:05:47,13 --> 00:05:55,38
every man according to the measure which he has measured 

42
00:05:55,38 --> 00:06:03,63
to his fellow man. 

43
00:06:03,63 --> 00:06:12,13
Wherefore the voice of the Lord is unto the ends 

44
00:06:12,13 --> 00:06:20,63
of the earth, that all that will hear may hear: 

45
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:25,147
Prepare ye, aprepare ye for that which is to come, 

46
00:06:25,147 --> 00:06:29,647
for the Lord is bnigh; 

47
00:06:29,673 --> 00:06:35,339
And the aanger of the Lord is kindled, and his 

48
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:41,006
bsword is bathed in heaven, and it shall fall upon 

49
00:06:41,006 --> 00:06:46,673
the inhabitants of the earth. 

50
00:06:46,69 --> 00:06:53,29
And the aarm of the Lord shall be revealed; and 

51
00:06:53,29 --> 00:06:59,89
the bday cometh that they who will not chear the 

52
00:06:59,89 --> 00:07:06,49
voice of the Lord, neither the voice of his dservants, 

53
00:07:06,49 --> 00:07:13,09
neither give eheed to the words of the prophets and 

54
00:07:13,09 --> 00:07:19,69
fapostles, shall be gcut off from among the people; 

55
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:28,189
For they have astrayed from mine bordinances, and have cbroken 

56
00:07:28,189 --> 00:07:36,689
mine deverlasting covenant; 

57
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:44,54
They aseek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but 

58
00:07:44,54 --> 00:07:52,373
every man bwalketh in his cown dway, and after the 

59
00:07:52,373 --> 00:08:00,206
eimage of his own god, whose image is in the 

60
00:08:00,206 --> 00:08:08,04
likeness of the world, and whose substance is that of 

61
00:08:08,04 --> 00:08:15,873
an idol, which waxeth fold and shall perish in gBabylon, 

62
00:08:15,873 --> 00:08:23,706
even Babylon the great, which shall fall. 

63
00:08:23,72 --> 00:08:27,97
Wherefore, I the Lord, aknowing the calamity which should come 

64
00:08:27,97 --> 00:08:32,22
upon the binhabitants of the earth, ccalled upon my dservant 

65
00:08:32,22 --> 00:08:36,47
Joseph Smith, Jun., and espake unto him from heaven, and 

66
00:08:36,47 --> 00:08:40,72
gave him fcommandments; 

67
00:08:40,737 --> 00:08:50,404
And also gave commandments to others, that they should proclaim 

68
00:08:50,404 --> 00:09:00,07
these things unto the world; and all this that it 

69
00:09:00,07 --> 00:09:09,737
might be fulfilled, which was written by the prophets— 

70
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:18,749
The aweak things of the world shall come forth and 

71
00:09:18,749 --> 00:09:27,749
break down the mighty and strong ones, that man bshould 

72
00:09:27,749 --> 00:09:36,749
not counsel his fellow man, neither ctrust in the arm 

73
00:09:36,749 --> 00:09:45,749
of flesh— 

74
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:50,319
But that every man might aspeak in the name of 

75
00:09:50,319 --> 00:09:54,819
God the Lord, even the Savior of the world; 

76
00:09:54,844 --> 00:10:03,844
That faith also might increase in the earth; 

77
00:10:03,87 --> 00:10:12,87
That mine everlasting acovenant might be established; 

78
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:18,579
That the afulness of my bgospel might be cproclaimed by 

79
00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:24,246
the dweak and the simple unto the ends of the 

80
00:10:24,246 --> 00:10:29,912
world, and before ekings and frulers. 

81
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:36,179
Behold, I am God and have spoken it; these acommandments 

82
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:42,429
are of me, and were given unto my servants in 

83
00:10:42,429 --> 00:10:48,679
their weakness, after the manner of their blanguage, that they 

84
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:54,929
might come to cunderstanding. 

85
00:10:54,938 --> 00:11:03,938
And inasmuch as they aerred it might be made known; 

86
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:11,479
And inasmuch as they sought awisdom they might be binstructed; 

87
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:15,471
And inasmuch as they sinned they might be achastened, that 

88
00:11:15,471 --> 00:11:19,471
they might brepent; 

89
00:11:19,462 --> 00:11:22,462
And inasmuch as they were ahumble they might be made 

90
00:11:22,462 --> 00:11:25,462
strong, and blessed from on high, and receive bknowledge from 

91
00:11:25,462 --> 00:11:28,462
time to time. 

92
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:32,738
And after having received the record of the Nephites, yea, 

93
00:11:32,738 --> 00:11:36,988
even my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., might have power to 

94
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:41,238
atranslate through the bmercy of God, by the power of 

95
00:11:41,238 --> 00:11:45,488
God, the cBook of Mormon. 

96
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:53,671
And also those to whom these commandments were given, might 

97
00:11:53,671 --> 00:12:01,838
have apower to lay the foundation of this bchurch, and 

98
00:12:01,838 --> 00:12:10,005
to bring it forth out of obscurity and out of 

99
00:12:10,005 --> 00:12:18,171
cdarkness, the only true and living dchurch upon the face 

100
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:26,338
of the whole earth, with which I, the Lord, am 

101
00:12:26,338 --> 00:12:34,505
well epleased, fspeaking unto the church collectively and not individually— 

102
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:38,504
For I the Lord cannot look upon asin with the 

103
00:12:38,504 --> 00:12:42,504
least degree of allowance; 

104
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:46,995
Nevertheless, he that arepents and does the bcommandments of the 

105
00:12:46,995 --> 00:12:51,495
Lord shall be cforgiven; 

106
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:55,771
And he that arepents not, from him shall be btaken 

107
00:12:55,771 --> 00:13:00,021
even the light which he has received; for my cSpirit 

108
00:13:00,021 --> 00:13:04,271
shall not always dstrive with man, saith the Lord of 

109
00:13:04,271 --> 00:13:08,521
Hosts. 

110
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:14,204
And again, verily I say unto you, O inhabitants of 

111
00:13:14,204 --> 00:13:19,871
the earth: I the Lord am willing to make these 

112
00:13:19,871 --> 00:13:25,538
things aknown unto ball flesh; 

113
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:31,355
For I am no arespecter of persons, and will that 

114
00:13:31,355 --> 00:13:37,155
all men shall know that the bday speedily cometh; the 

115
00:13:37,155 --> 00:13:42,955
hour is not yet, but is nigh at hand, when 

116
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:48,755
cpeace shall be taken from the earth, and the ddevil 

117
00:13:48,755 --> 00:13:54,555
shall have power over his own dominion. 

118
00:13:54,567 --> 00:14:00,234
And also the Lord shall have apower over his bsaints, 

119
00:14:00,234 --> 00:14:05,9
and shall creign in their dmidst, and shall come down 

120
00:14:05,9 --> 00:14:11,567
in ejudgment upon fIdumea, or the world. 

121
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:19,917
aSearch these bcommandments, for they are true and cfaithful, and 

122
00:14:19,917 --> 00:14:28,251
the prophecies and dpromises which are in them shall all 

123
00:14:28,251 --> 00:14:36,584
be fulfilled. 

124
00:14:36,592 --> 00:14:43,192
What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and 

125
00:14:43,192 --> 00:14:49,792
I excuse not myself; and though the heavens and the 

126
00:14:49,792 --> 00:14:56,392
earth pass away, my aword shall not pass away, but 

127
00:14:56,392 --> 00:15:02,992
shall all be bfulfilled, whether by mine own cvoice or 

128
00:15:02,992 --> 00:15:09,592
by the dvoice of my eservants, it is the fsame. 

129
00:15:09,592 --> 00:15:18,925
For behold, and lo, the Lord is God, and the 

130
00:15:18,925 --> 00:15:28,259
aSpirit beareth record, and the record is true, and the 

131
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:37,592
btruth abideth forever and ever. Amen.
