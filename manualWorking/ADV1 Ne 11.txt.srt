Chapter 11 Nephi sees the Spirit of the Lord and 

1
0:0:9,039 --> 0:0:18,079
is shown in vision the tree of life—He sees the 

2
0:0:18,079 --> 0:0:27,118
mother of the Son of God and learns of the 

3
0:0:27,118 --> 0:0:36,158
condescension of God—He sees the baptism, ministry, and crucifixion of 

4
0:0:36,158 --> 0:0:45,197
the Lamb of God—He sees also the call and ministry 

5
0:0:45,197 --> 0:0:54,237
of the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb. About 600–592 B.C. 

6
0:0:54,237 --> 0:0:59,682
1 For it came to pass after I had desired 

7
0:0:59,682 --> 0:1:5,127
to know the things that my father had seen, and 

8
0:1:5,127 --> 0:1:10,572
believing that the Lord was able to make them known 

9
0:1:10,572 --> 0:1:16,017
unto me, as I sat pondering in mine heart I 

10
0:1:16,017 --> 0:1:21,462
was caught away in the Spirit of the Lord, yea, 

11
0:1:21,462 --> 0:1:26,907
into an exceedingly high mountain, which I never had before 

12
0:1:26,907 --> 0:1:32,352
seen, and upon which I never had before set my 

13
0:1:32,352 --> 0:1:37,797
foot. 

14
0:1:37,797 --> 0:1:41,573
2 And the Spirit said unto me: Behold, what desirest 

15
0:1:41,573 --> 0:1:45,348
thou? 

16
0:1:45,348 --> 0:1:49,602
3 And I said: I desire to behold the things 

17
0:1:49,602 --> 0:1:53,856
which my father saw. 

18
0:1:53,856 --> 0:2:1,001
4 And the Spirit said unto me: Believest thou that 

19
0:2:1,001 --> 0:2:8,146
thy father saw the tree of which he hath spoken? 

20
0:2:8,146 --> 0:2:13,672
5 And I said: Yea, thou knowest that I believe 

21
0:2:13,672 --> 0:2:19,198
all the words of my father. 

22
0:2:19,198 --> 0:2:27,082
6 And when I had spoken these words, the Spirit 

23
0:2:27,082 --> 0:2:34,966
cried with a loud voice, saying: Hosanna to the Lord, 

24
0:2:34,966 --> 0:2:42,85
the most high God; for he is God over all 

25
0:2:42,85 --> 0:2:50,733
the earth, yea, even above all. And blessed art thou, 

26
0:2:50,733 --> 0:2:58,617
Nephi, because thou believest in the Son of the most 

27
0:2:58,617 --> 0:3:6,501
high God; wherefore, thou shalt behold the things which thou 

28
0:3:6,501 --> 0:3:14,385
hast desired. 

29
0:3:14,385 --> 0:3:21,608
7 And behold this thing shall be given unto thee 

30
0:3:21,608 --> 0:3:28,831
for a sign, that after thou hast beheld the tree 

31
0:3:28,831 --> 0:3:36,054
which bore the fruit which thy father tasted, thou shalt 

32
0:3:36,054 --> 0:3:43,276
also behold a man descending out of heaven, and him 

33
0:3:43,276 --> 0:3:50,499
shall ye witness; and after ye have witnessed him ye 

34
0:3:50,499 --> 0:3:57,722
shall bear record that it is the Son of God. 

35
0:3:57,722 --> 0:4:5,194
8 And it came to pass that the Spirit said 

36
0:4:5,194 --> 0:4:12,667
unto me: Look! And I looked and beheld a tree; 

37
0:4:12,667 --> 0:4:20,139
and it was like unto the tree which my father 

38
0:4:20,139 --> 0:4:27,611
had seen; and the beauty thereof was far beyond, yea, 

39
0:4:27,611 --> 0:4:35,084
exceeding of all beauty; and the whiteness thereof did exceed 

40
0:4:35,084 --> 0:4:42,556
the whiteness of the driven snow. 

41
0:4:42,556 --> 0:4:47,412
9 And it came to pass after I had seen 

42
0:4:47,412 --> 0:4:52,268
the tree, I said unto the Spirit: I behold thou 

43
0:4:52,268 --> 0:4:57,125
hast shown unto me the tree which is precious above 

44
0:4:57,125 --> 0:5:1,981
all. 

45
0:5:1,981 --> 0:5:8,513
10 And he said unto me: What desirest thou? 

46
0:5:8,513 --> 0:5:14,739
11 And I said unto him: To know the interpretation 

47
0:5:14,739 --> 0:5:20,966
thereof—for I spake unto him as a man speaketh; for 

48
0:5:20,966 --> 0:5:27,193
I beheld that he was in the form of a 

49
0:5:27,193 --> 0:5:33,419
man; yet nevertheless, I knew that it was the Spirit 

50
0:5:33,419 --> 0:5:39,646
of the Lord; and he spake unto me as a 

51
0:5:39,646 --> 0:5:45,873
man speaketh with another. 

52
0:5:45,873 --> 0:5:51,266
12 And it came to pass that he said unto 

53
0:5:51,266 --> 0:5:56,659
me: Look! And I looked as if to look upon 

54
0:5:56,659 --> 0:6:2,052
him, and I saw him not; for he had gone 

55
0:6:2,052 --> 0:6:7,445
from before my presence. 

56
0:6:7,445 --> 0:6:15,126
13 And it came to pass that I looked and 

57
0:6:15,126 --> 0:6:22,808
beheld the great city of Jerusalem, and also other cities. 

58
0:6:22,808 --> 0:6:30,489
And I beheld the city of Nazareth; and in the 

59
0:6:30,489 --> 0:6:38,17
city of Nazareth I beheld a virgin, and she was 

60
0:6:38,17 --> 0:6:45,851
exceedingly fair and white. 

61
0:6:45,851 --> 0:6:51,642
14 And it came to pass that I saw the 

62
0:6:51,642 --> 0:6:57,433
heavens open; and an angel came down and stood before 

63
0:6:57,433 --> 0:7:3,223
me; and he said unto me: Nephi, what beholdest thou? 

64
0:7:3,223 --> 0:7:10,668
15 And I said unto him: A virgin, most beautiful 

65
0:7:10,668 --> 0:7:18,112
and fair above all other virgins. 

66
0:7:18,112 --> 0:7:22,949
16 And he said unto me: Knowest thou the condescension 

67
0:7:22,949 --> 0:7:27,786
of God? 

68
0:7:27,786 --> 0:7:32,518
17 And I said unto him: I know that he 

69
0:7:32,518 --> 0:7:37,249
loveth his children; nevertheless, I do not know the meaning 

70
0:7:37,249 --> 0:7:41,981
of all things. 

71
0:7:41,981 --> 0:7:47,781
18 And he said unto me: Behold, the virgin whom 

72
0:7:47,781 --> 0:7:53,581
thou seest is the mother of the Son of God, 

73
0:7:53,581 --> 0:7:59,381
after the manner of the flesh. 

74
0:7:59,381 --> 0:8:3,993
19 And it came to pass that I beheld that 

75
0:8:3,993 --> 0:8:8,606
she was carried away in the Spirit; and after she 

76
0:8:8,606 --> 0:8:13,219
had been carried away in the Spirit for the space 

77
0:8:13,219 --> 0:8:17,831
of a time the angel spake unto me, saying: Look! 

78
0:8:17,831 --> 0:8:22,824
20 And I looked and beheld the virgin again, bearing 

79
0:8:22,824 --> 0:8:27,817
a child in her arms. 

80
0:8:27,817 --> 0:8:33,819
21 And the angel said unto me: Behold the Lamb 

81
0:8:33,819 --> 0:8:39,821
of God, yea, even the Son of the Eternal Father! 

82
0:8:39,821 --> 0:8:45,823
Knowest thou the meaning of the tree which thy father 

83
0:8:45,823 --> 0:8:51,825
saw? 

84
0:8:51,825 --> 0:8:58,281
22 And I answered him, saying: Yea, it is the 

85
0:8:58,281 --> 0:9:4,737
love of God, which sheddeth itself abroad in the hearts 

86
0:9:4,737 --> 0:9:11,194
of the children of men; wherefore, it is the most 

87
0:9:11,194 --> 0:9:17,65
desirable above all things. 

88
0:9:17,65 --> 0:9:23,903
23 And he spake unto me, saying: Yea, and the 

89
0:9:23,903 --> 0:9:30,155
most joyous to the soul. 

90
0:9:30,155 --> 0:9:36,004
24 And after he had said these words, he said 

91
0:9:36,004 --> 0:9:41,854
unto me: Look! And I looked, and I beheld the 

92
0:9:41,854 --> 0:9:47,703
Son of God going forth among the children of men; 

93
0:9:47,703 --> 0:9:53,552
and I saw many fall down at his feet and 

94
0:9:53,552 --> 0:9:59,402
worship him. 

95
0:9:59,402 --> 0:10:4,877
25 And it came to pass that I beheld that 

96
0:10:4,877 --> 0:10:10,353
the rod of iron, which my father had seen, was 

97
0:10:10,353 --> 0:10:15,829
the word of God, which led to the fountain of 

98
0:10:15,829 --> 0:10:21,305
living waters, or to the tree of life; which waters 

99
0:10:21,305 --> 0:10:26,78
are a representation of the love of God; and I 

100
0:10:26,78 --> 0:10:32,256
also beheld that the tree of life was a representation 

101
0:10:32,256 --> 0:10:37,732
of the love of God. 

102
0:10:37,732 --> 0:10:45,228
26 And the angel said unto me again: Look and 

103
0:10:45,228 --> 0:10:52,724
behold the condescension of God! 

104
0:10:52,724 --> 0:10:58,578
27 And I looked and beheld the Redeemer of the 

105
0:10:58,578 --> 0:11:4,432
world, of whom my father had spoken; and I also 

106
0:11:4,432 --> 0:11:10,286
beheld the prophet who should prepare the way before him. 

107
0:11:10,286 --> 0:11:16,14
And the Lamb of God went forth and was baptized 

108
0:11:16,14 --> 0:11:21,993
of him; and after he was baptized, I beheld the 

109
0:11:21,993 --> 0:11:27,847
heavens open, and the Holy Ghost come down out of 

110
0:11:27,847 --> 0:11:33,701
heaven and abide upon him in the form of a 

111
0:11:33,701 --> 0:11:39,555
dove. 

112
0:11:39,555 --> 0:11:45,721
28 And I beheld that he went forth ministering unto 

113
0:11:45,721 --> 0:11:51,886
the people, in power and great glory; and the multitudes 

114
0:11:51,886 --> 0:11:58,052
were gathered together to hear him; and I beheld that 

115
0:11:58,052 --> 0:12:4,218
they cast him out from among them. 

116
0:12:4,218 --> 0:12:8,721
29 And I also beheld twelve others following him. And 

117
0:12:8,721 --> 0:12:13,223
it came to pass that they were carried away in 

118
0:12:13,223 --> 0:12:17,726
the Spirit from before my face, and I saw them 

119
0:12:17,726 --> 0:12:22,229
not. 

120
0:12:22,229 --> 0:12:28,013
30 And it came to pass that the angel spake 

121
0:12:28,013 --> 0:12:33,797
unto me again, saying: Look! And I looked, and I 

122
0:12:33,797 --> 0:12:39,58
beheld the heavens open again, and I saw angels descending 

123
0:12:39,58 --> 0:12:45,364
upon the children of men; and they did minister unto 

124
0:12:45,364 --> 0:12:51,148
them. 

125
0:12:51,148 --> 0:12:57,69
31 And he spake unto me again, saying: Look! And 

126
0:12:57,69 --> 0:13:4,233
I looked, and I beheld the Lamb of God going 

127
0:13:4,233 --> 0:13:10,775
forth among the children of men. And I beheld multitudes 

128
0:13:10,775 --> 0:13:17,317
of people who were sick, and who were afflicted with 

129
0:13:17,317 --> 0:13:23,86
all manner of diseases, and with devils and unclean spirits; 

130
0:13:23,86 --> 0:13:30,402
and the angel spake and showed all these things unto 

131
0:13:30,402 --> 0:13:36,944
me. And they were healed by the power of the 

132
0:13:36,944 --> 0:13:43,486
Lamb of God; and the devils and the unclean spirits 

133
0:13:43,486 --> 0:13:50,029
were cast out. 

134
0:13:50,029 --> 0:13:57,088
32 And it came to pass that the angel spake 

135
0:13:57,088 --> 0:14:4,147
unto me again, saying: Look! And I looked and beheld 

136
0:14:4,147 --> 0:14:11,206
the Lamb of God, that he was taken by the 

137
0:14:11,206 --> 0:14:18,265
people; yea, the Son of the everlasting God was judged 

138
0:14:18,265 --> 0:14:25,324
of the world; and I saw and bear record. 

139
0:14:25,324 --> 0:14:30,77
33 And I, Nephi, saw that he was lifted up 

140
0:14:30,77 --> 0:14:36,216
upon the cross and slain for the sins of the 

141
0:14:36,216 --> 0:14:41,662
world. 

142
0:14:41,662 --> 0:14:49,527
34 And after he was slain I saw the multitudes 

143
0:14:49,527 --> 0:14:57,392
of the earth, that they were gathered together to fight 

144
0:14:57,392 --> 0:15:5,256
against the apostles of the Lamb; for thus were the 

145
0:15:5,256 --> 0:15:13,121
twelve called by the angel of the Lord. 

146
0:15:13,121 --> 0:15:20,107
35 And the multitude of the earth was gathered together; 

147
0:15:20,107 --> 0:15:27,093
and I beheld that they were in a large and 

148
0:15:27,093 --> 0:15:34,079
spacious building, like unto the building which my father saw. 

149
0:15:34,079 --> 0:15:41,065
And the angel of the Lord spake unto me again, 

150
0:15:41,065 --> 0:15:48,051
saying: Behold the world and the wisdom thereof; yea, behold 

151
0:15:48,051 --> 0:15:55,038
the house of Israel hath gathered together to fight against 

152
0:15:55,038 --> 0:16:2,024
the twelve apostles of the Lamb. 

153
0:16:2,024 --> 0:16:10,021
36 And it came to pass that I saw and 

154
0:16:10,021 --> 0:16:18,018
bear record, that the great and spacious building was the 

155
0:16:18,018 --> 0:16:26,016
pride of the world; and it fell, and the fall 

156
0:16:26,016 --> 0:16:34,013
thereof was exceedingly great. And the angel of the Lord 

157
0:16:34,013 --> 0:16:42,011
spake unto me again, saying: Thus shall be the destruction 

158
0:16:42,011 --> 0:16:50,008
of all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, that shall fight 

159
0:16:50,008 --> 0:16:58,005
against the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
