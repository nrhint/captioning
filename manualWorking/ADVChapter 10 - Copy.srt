Chapter 10 

1
0:0:2,533 --> 0:0:13,344
A testimony of the Book of Mormon comes by the 

2
0:0:13,344 --> 0:0:24,155
power of the Holy Ghost—The gifts of the Spirit are 

3
0:0:24,155 --> 0:0:34,965
dispensed to the faithful—Spiritual gifts always accompany faith—Moroni’s words speak 

4
0:0:34,965 --> 0:0:45,776
from the dust—Come unto Christ, be perfected in Him, and 

5
0:0:45,776 --> 0:0:56,587
sanctify your souls. About A.D. 421. 

6
0:0:56,587 --> 0:1:2,419
1 Now I, Moroni, write somewhat as seemeth me good; 

7
0:1:2,419 --> 0:1:8,251
and I write unto my brethren, the Lamanites; and I 

8
0:1:8,251 --> 0:1:14,083
would that they should know that more than four hundred 

9
0:1:14,083 --> 0:1:19,915
and twenty years have passed away since the sign was 

10
0:1:19,915 --> 0:1:25,747
given of the coming of Christ. 

11
0:1:25,747 --> 0:1:33,473
2 And I seal up these records, after I have 

12
0:1:33,473 --> 0:1:41,199
spoken a few words by way of exhortation unto you. 

13
0:1:41,199 --> 0:1:46,493
3 Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall 

14
0:1:46,493 --> 0:1:51,786
read these things, if it be wisdom in God that 

15
0:1:51,786 --> 0:1:57,079
ye should read them, that ye would remember how merciful 

16
0:1:57,079 --> 0:2:2,372
the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from 

17
0:2:2,372 --> 0:2:7,665
the creation of Adam even down until the time that 

18
0:2:7,665 --> 0:2:12,959
ye shall receive these things, and ponder it in your 

19
0:2:12,959 --> 0:2:18,252
hearts. 

20
0:2:18,252 --> 0:2:23,626
4 And when ye shall receive these things, I would 

21
0:2:23,626 --> 0:2:28,999
exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, 

22
0:2:28,999 --> 0:2:34,373
in the name of Christ, if these things are not 

23
0:2:34,373 --> 0:2:39,747
true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, 

24
0:2:39,747 --> 0:2:45,121
with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest 

25
0:2:45,121 --> 0:2:50,495
the truth of it unto you, by the power of 

26
0:2:50,495 --> 0:2:55,869
the Holy Ghost. 

27
0:2:55,869 --> 0:3:1,06
5 And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye 

28
0:3:1,06 --> 0:3:6,252
may know the truth of all things. 

29
0:3:6,252 --> 0:3:13,207
6 And whatsoever thing is good is just and true; 

30
0:3:13,207 --> 0:3:20,163
wherefore, nothing that is good denieth the Christ, but acknowledgeth 

31
0:3:20,163 --> 0:3:27,118
that he is. 

32
0:3:27,118 --> 0:3:34,269
7 And ye may know that he is, by the 

33
0:3:34,269 --> 0:3:41,421
power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore I would exhort you 

34
0:3:41,421 --> 0:3:48,572
that ye deny not the power of God; for he 

35
0:3:48,572 --> 0:3:55,724
worketh by power, according to the faith of the children 

36
0:3:55,724 --> 0:4:2,875
of men, the same today and tomorrow, and forever. 

37
0:4:2,875 --> 0:4:9,672
8 And again, I exhort you, my brethren, that ye 

38
0:4:9,672 --> 0:4:16,469
deny not the gifts of God, for they are many; 

39
0:4:16,469 --> 0:4:23,267
and they come from the same God. And there are 

40
0:4:23,267 --> 0:4:30,064
different ways that these gifts are administered; but it is 

41
0:4:30,064 --> 0:4:36,861
the same God who worketh all in all; and they 

42
0:4:36,861 --> 0:4:43,658
are given by the manifestations of the Spirit of God 

43
0:4:43,658 --> 0:4:50,456
unto men, to profit them. 

44
0:4:50,456 --> 0:4:56,918
9 For behold, to one is given by the Spirit 

45
0:4:56,918 --> 0:5:3,381
of God, that he may teach the word of wisdom; 

46
0:5:3,381 --> 0:5:9,871
10 And to another, that he may teach the word 

47
0:5:9,871 --> 0:5:16,361
of knowledge by the same Spirit; 

48
0:5:16,361 --> 0:5:24,226
11 And to another, exceedingly great faith; and to another, 

49
0:5:24,226 --> 0:5:32,091
the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; 

50
0:5:32,091 --> 0:5:37,844
12 And again, to another, that he may work mighty 

51
0:5:37,844 --> 0:5:43,597
miracles; 

52
0:5:43,597 --> 0:5:48,483
13 And again, to another, that he may prophesy concerning 

53
0:5:48,483 --> 0:5:53,368
all things; 

54
0:5:53,368 --> 0:5:58,943
14 And again, to another, the beholding of angels and 

55
0:5:58,943 --> 0:6:4,518
ministering spirits; 

56
0:6:4,518 --> 0:6:11,402
15 And again, to another, all kinds of tongues; 

57
0:6:11,402 --> 0:6:16,876
16 And again, to another, the interpretation of languages and 

58
0:6:16,876 --> 0:6:22,35
of divers kinds of tongues. 

59
0:6:22,35 --> 0:6:28,623
17 And all these gifts come by the Spirit of 

60
0:6:28,623 --> 0:6:34,896
Christ; and they come unto every man severally, according as 

61
0:6:34,896 --> 0:6:41,169
he will. 

62
0:6:41,169 --> 0:6:50,394
18 And I would exhort you, my beloved brethren, that 

63
0:6:50,394 --> 0:6:59,619
ye remember that every good gift cometh of Christ. 

64
0:6:59,619 --> 0:7:6,24
19 And I would exhort you, my beloved brethren, that 

65
0:7:6,24 --> 0:7:12,86
ye remember that he is the same yesterday, today, and 

66
0:7:12,86 --> 0:7:19,48
forever, and that all these gifts of which I have 

67
0:7:19,48 --> 0:7:26,1
spoken, which are spiritual, never will be done away, even 

68
0:7:26,1 --> 0:7:32,72
as long as the world shall stand, only according to 

69
0:7:32,72 --> 0:7:39,341
the unbelief of the children of men. 

70
0:7:39,341 --> 0:7:46,823
20 Wherefore, there must be faith; and if there must 

71
0:7:46,823 --> 0:7:54,306
be faith there must also be hope; and if there 

72
0:7:54,306 --> 0:8:1,789
must be hope there must also be charity. 

73
0:8:1,789 --> 0:8:8,238
21 And except ye have charity ye can in nowise 

74
0:8:8,238 --> 0:8:14,687
be saved in the kingdom of God; neither can ye 

75
0:8:14,687 --> 0:8:21,136
be saved in the kingdom of God if ye have 

76
0:8:21,136 --> 0:8:27,585
not faith; neither can ye if ye have no hope. 

77
0:8:27,585 --> 0:8:35,395
22 And if ye have no hope ye must needs 

78
0:8:35,395 --> 0:8:43,204
be in despair; and despair cometh because of iniquity. 

79
0:8:43,204 --> 0:8:48,944
23 And Christ truly said unto our fathers: If ye 

80
0:8:48,944 --> 0:8:54,683
have faith ye can do all things which are expedient 

81
0:8:54,683 --> 0:9:0,423
unto me. 

82
0:9:0,423 --> 0:9:5,784
24 And now I speak unto all the ends of 

83
0:9:5,784 --> 0:9:11,146
the earth—that if the day cometh that the power and 

84
0:9:11,146 --> 0:9:16,507
gifts of God shall be done away among you, it 

85
0:9:16,507 --> 0:9:21,869
shall be because of unbelief. 

86
0:9:21,869 --> 0:9:28,225
25 And wo be unto the children of men if 

87
0:9:28,225 --> 0:9:34,581
this be the case; for there shall be none that 

88
0:9:34,581 --> 0:9:40,937
doeth good among you, no not one. For if there 

89
0:9:40,937 --> 0:9:47,293
be one among you that doeth good, he shall work 

90
0:9:47,293 --> 0:9:53,649
by the power and gifts of God. 

91
0:9:53,649 --> 0:9:59,324
26 And wo unto them who shall do these things 

92
0:9:59,324 --> 0:10:4,998
away and die, for they die in their sins, and 

93
0:10:4,998 --> 0:10:10,673
they cannot be saved in the kingdom of God; and 

94
0:10:10,673 --> 0:10:16,347
I speak it according to the words of Christ; and 

95
0:10:16,347 --> 0:10:22,021
I lie not. 

96
0:10:22,021 --> 0:10:28,826
27 And I exhort you to remember these things; for 

97
0:10:28,826 --> 0:10:35,63
the time speedily cometh that ye shall know that I 

98
0:10:35,63 --> 0:10:42,435
lie not, for ye shall see me at the bar 

99
0:10:42,435 --> 0:10:49,239
of God; and the Lord God will say unto you: 

100
0:10:49,239 --> 0:10:56,044
Did I not declare my words unto you, which were 

101
0:10:56,044 --> 0:11:2,849
written by this man, like as one crying from the 

102
0:11:2,849 --> 0:11:9,653
dead, yea, even as one speaking out of the dust? 

103
0:11:9,653 --> 0:11:16,906
28 I declare these things unto the fulfilling of the 

104
0:11:16,906 --> 0:11:24,159
prophecies. And behold, they shall proceed forth out of the 

105
0:11:24,159 --> 0:11:31,412
mouth of the everlasting God; and his word shall hiss 

106
0:11:31,412 --> 0:11:38,665
forth from generation to generation. 

107
0:11:38,665 --> 0:11:43,476
29 And God shall show unto you, that that which 

108
0:11:43,476 --> 0:11:48,288
I have written is true. 

109
0:11:48,288 --> 0:11:56,436
30 And again I would exhort you that ye would 

110
0:11:56,436 --> 0:12:4,585
come unto Christ, and lay hold upon every good gift, 

111
0:12:4,585 --> 0:12:12,734
and touch not the evil gift, nor the unclean thing. 

112
0:12:12,734 --> 0:12:21,342
31 And awake, and arise from the dust, O Jerusalem; 

113
0:12:21,342 --> 0:12:29,95
yea, and put on thy beautiful garments, O daughter of 

114
0:12:29,95 --> 0:12:38,558
Zion; and strengthen thy stakes and enlarge thy borders forever, 

115
0:12:38,558 --> 0:12:47,166
that thou mayest no more be confounded, that the covenants 

116
0:12:47,166 --> 0:12:55,774
of the Eternal Father which he hath made unto thee, 

117
0:12:55,774 --> 0:13:4,382
O house of Israel, may be fulfilled. 

118
0:13:4,382 --> 0:13:12,446
32 Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, 

119
0:13:12,446 --> 0:13:20,51
and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye shall 

120
0:13:20,51 --> 0:13:28,574
deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with all 

121
0:13:28,574 --> 0:13:36,638
your might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient 

122
0:13:36,638 --> 0:13:44,702
for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect 

123
0:13:44,702 --> 0:13:52,766
in Christ; and if by the grace of God ye 

124
0:13:52,766 --> 0:14:0,83
are perfect in Christ, ye can in nowise deny the 

125
0:14:0,83 --> 0:14:8,894
power of God. 

126
0:14:8,894 --> 0:14:15,717
33 And again, if ye by the grace of God 

127
0:14:15,717 --> 0:14:22,539
are perfect in Christ, and deny not his power, then 

128
0:14:22,539 --> 0:14:29,362
are ye sanctified in Christ by the grace of God, 

129
0:14:29,362 --> 0:14:36,184
through the shedding of the blood of Christ, which is 

130
0:14:36,184 --> 0:14:43,007
in the covenant of the Father unto the remission of 

131
0:14:43,007 --> 0:14:49,829
your sins, that ye become holy, without spot. 

132
0:14:49,829 --> 0:14:56,314
34 And now I bid unto all, farewell. I soon 

133
0:14:56,314 --> 0:15:2,798
go to rest in the paradise of God, until my 

134
0:15:2,798 --> 0:15:9,282
spirit and body shall again reunite, and I am brought 

135
0:15:9,282 --> 0:15:15,767
forth triumphant through the air, to meet you before the 

136
0:15:15,767 --> 0:15:22,251
pleasing bar of the great Jehovah, the Eternal Judge of 

137
0:15:22,251 --> 0:15:28,736
both quick and dead. Amen.
